Such two additional bounds are known, in the spirit of the work of H.\nFujita and T. Kato \\cite{kato1,kato2}, to be sufficient for showing\nwell-posedness for the 3D NS equations. Furthermore, they are directly linked\nto the helicity evolution for the dNS model, and therefore with a clear\nphysical meaning and consequences. \n\n"}

The\nsingular potential is a function of the admissible statistical averages of\nprobability distributions on a state space, defined so that it corresponds to\nthe maximum possible entropy given known observed statistical averages,\nalthough non-classical entropy-like objective functions will also be\nconsidered. First the set of admissible moments must be established, and under\nthe conditions presented in this work the set is open, bounded and convex\nallowing a description in terms of supporting hyperplanes, which provides\nestimates on the development of singularities for related probability\ndistributions. Under appropriate conditions it is shown that the singular\npotential is strictly convex, as differentiable as the microscopic entropy and\nblows up uniformly as the macroscopic variable tends to the boundary of the set\nof admissible moments.

We prove that the well-known phenomenon of shock formation\nin simple plane wave solutions, starting from smooth initial conditions, is\nstable under perturbations that break the plane symmetry.

The new feature of\nour work is that the perturbed solutions are allowed to have small but non-zero\nvorticity, even at the location of the shock. Thus, our results provide the\nfirst constructive description of the vorticity near a singularity formed from\ncompression: relative to a system of geometric coordinates adapted to the\nacoustic characteristics, the vorticity remains many times differentiable, all\nthe way up to the shock. In addition, relative to the Cartesian coordinates,\nthe vorticity remains bounded up to the shock.\n  To control the vorticity, we rely on a coalition of new geometric and\nanalytic insights that complement the ones used by Christodoulou in his\ngroundbreaking, sharp proof of shock formation in vorticity-free regions.

In this work, we revisit its solutions, seeking,\nin particular, self-similar profiles. This problem connects to the classical\ntheory of special functions and, more specifically, to the Hermite as well as\nthe Kummer hypergeometric functions. Reconstructing the solution of the\noriginal diffusion model from novel self-similar solutions of the associated\nself-similar PDE, we infer that the $t^{-1/2}$ decay law of the diffusion\namplitude is {\\it not necessary}. In particular, it is possible to engineer\nsetups of {\\it both} the Cauchy problem and the initial-boundary value problem\nin which the solution decays at a {\\it different rate}. Nevertheless, we\nobserve that the $t^{-1/2}$ rate corresponds to the dominant decay mode among\nintegrable initial data, i.e., ones corresponding to finite mass. Hence, unless\nthe projection to such a mode is eliminated, generically this decay will be the\nslowest one observed. In initial-boundary value problems, an additional issue\nthat arises is whether the boundary data are \\textit{consonant} with the\ninitial data; namely, whether the boundary data agree at all times with the\nsolution of the Cauchy problem associated with the same initial data, when this\nsolution is evaluated at the boundary of the domain. In that case, the power\nlaw dictated by the solution of the Cauchy problem will be selected.

For data prescribed on ${\\mathbb R}^3\\setminus B_R$ with small weighted\nenergy, without some form of null conditions on the nonlinearity, the exterior\nstability is not expected to hold in the full domain of dependence.\n  In this paper, we prove that, there exists a constant $R(\\ga_0)\\ge 2$,\ndepending on the fixed weight exponent $\\ga_0>1$ in the weighted energy norm,\nif the norm of the data are sufficiently small on ${\\mathbb R}^3\\setminus B_R$\nwith the fixed number $R\\ge R(\\ga_0)$, the solution exists and is unique in the\nentire exterior of a schwarzschild cone initiating from $\\{|x|=R\\}$ (including\nthe boundary) with small negative mass $-M_0$. $M_0$ is determined according to\nthe size of the initial data. In this exterior region, by constructing the\nschwarzschild cone foliation, we can improve the linear behavior of wave\nequations in particular on the transversal derivative $\\Lb \\phi$. Such\nimprovement enables us to control the nonlinearity violating the null condition\nwithout loss, and thus show the solutions converge to the trivial solution.\n  As an application, we give the exterior stability result for Einstein\n(massive and massless) scalar fields. We prove the solution converges to a\nsmall static solution, stable in the entire exterior of a schwarzschild cone\nwith positive mass, which then is patchable to the interior results. \n\n"}

Both equations are canonical\nintegrable $U(1)$ models, with solitons, multi-solitons and breather solutions,\nsee Yang for instance. For these two equations, we recognize four distinct\nlocalized breather modes: the Sasa-Satsuma for SS, and for NLS the\nSatsuma-Yajima, Kuznetsov-Ma and Peregrine breathers. Very little is known\nabout the stability of these solutions, mainly because of their complex\nstructure, which does not fit into the classical soliton behavior by\nGrillakis-Shatah-Strauss. In this paper we find the natural $H^2$ variational\ncharacterization for each of them, and prove that Sasa-Satsuma breathers are\n$H^2$ nonlinearly stable, improving the linear stability property previously\nproved by Pelinovsky and Yang.

We consider equivariant solutions with energy near the energy of\nthe two-parameter family of equivariant harmonic maps. We prove that if the\ntopological degree of the map is at least four, blowup does {\\it not} occur,\nand global solutions converge (in a dispersive sense -- i.e. scatter) to a\nfixed harmonic map as time tends to infinity. The proof uses, among other\nthings, a time-dependent splitting of the solution, the ``generalized Hasimoto\ntransform\", and Strichartz (dispersive) estimates for a certain two\nspace-dimensional linear Schr\\\"odinger equation whose potential has critical\npower spatial singularity and decay.

We study a wave propagation governed by a nonlinear system of\nhyperbolic PDE's with constant coefficients with the initial data being a\nmulti-wavepacket. By definition a general wavepacket has a well defined\nprincipal wave vector, and, as we proved in previous works, the nonlinear\ndynamics preserves systems of wavepackets and their principal wave vectors.\nHere we study the nonlinear evolution of a special class of wavepackets, namely\nparticle-like wavepackets. A particle-like wavepacket is of a dual nature: on\none hand, it is a wave with a well defined principal wave vector, on the other\nhand, it a particle in the sense that it can be assigned a well defined\nposition in the space. We prove that under the nonlinear evolution a generic\nmulti-particle wavepacket remains to be a multi-particle wavepacket with a high\naccuracy, and every constituting single particle-like wavepacket not only\npreserves its principal wave number but also it has a well-defined space\nposition evolving with a constant velocity which is its group velocity.\nRemarkably the described properties hold though the involved single\nparticle-like wavepackets undergo nonlinear interactions and multiple\ncollisions in the space. We also prove that if principal wavevectors of\nmulti-particle wavepacket are generic, the result of nonlinear interactions\nbetween different wavepackets is small and the approximate linear superposition\nprinciple holds uniformly with respect to the initial spatial positions of\nwavepackets. \n\n"}

{"id": "math/0701780", "contents": "Title: Spectral analysis of magnetic Laplacians on conformally cusp manifolds Abstract: We consider an open manifold which is the interior of a compact manifold with\nboundary. Assuming gauge invariance, we classify magnetic fields with compact\nsupport into being trapping or non-trapping. We study spectral properties of\nthe associated magnetic Laplacian for a class of Riemannian metrics which\nincludes complete hyperbolic metrics of finite volume. When $B$ is\nnon-trapping, the magnetic Laplacian has nonempty essential spectrum. Using\nMourre theory, we show the absence of singular continuous spectrum and the\nlocal finiteness of the point spectrum. When $B$ is trapping, the spectrum is\ndiscrete and obeys the Weyl law. The existence of trapping magnetic fields with\ncompact support depends on cohomological conditions, indicating a new and very\nstrong long-range effect.\n  In the non-gauge invariant case, we exhibit a strong Aharonov-Bohm effect. On\nhyperbolic surfaces with at least two cusps, we show that the magnetic\nLaplacian associated to every magnetic field with compact support has purely\ndiscrete spectrum for some choices of the vector potential, while other choices\nlead to a situation of limit absorption principle.\n  We also study perturbations of the metric. We show that in the Mourre theory\nit is not necessary to require a decay of the derivatives of the perturbation.\nThis very singular perturbation is then brought closer to the perturbation of a\npotential. \n\n"}
