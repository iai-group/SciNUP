Here we\ndemonstrate unconditional one-way quantum computation experiments for\ncontinuous variables using a linear cluster state of four entangled optical\nmodes. We implement an important set of quantum operations, linear\ntransformations, in the optical phase space through one-way computation. Though\nnot sufficient, these are necessary for universal quantum computation over\ncontinuous variables, and in our scheme, in principle, any such linear\ntransformation can be unconditionally and deterministically applied to\narbitrary single-mode quantum states. \n\n"}

Working in the independent-particle framework,\nwe find that the finite-field orbital magnetization can be written as a sum of\nthree gauge-invariant contributions, one of which has no counterpart at zero\nfield. The extra contribution is collinear with and explicitly dependent on the\nelectric field. The expression for the orbital magnetization is suitable for\nfirst-principles implementations, allowing to calculate the magnetoelectric\nresponse coefficients by numerical differentiation. Alternatively,\nperturbation-theory techniques may be used, and for that purpose we derive an\nexpression directly for the linear magnetoelectric tensor by taking the first\nfield-derivative analytically.

Coulomb interactions couple the interfering edge mode to localized\nquasiparticle states in the bulk, whose occupation is quantized in integer\nvalues. For the integer quantum Hall effect, if the bulk-edge coupling is\nabsent, the resistance exhibits an Aharonov-Bohm (AB) periodicity, where the\nphase is equal to the number of quanta of magnetic flux enclosed by a specified\ninterferometer area. When bulk-edge coupling is present, the actual area of the\ninterferometer oscillates as function of B and V_G, with a combination of a\nsmooth variation and abrupt jumps due to changes in the number of\nquasi-particles in the bulk of the interferometer.

In a recent paper, M\\\"uller, Peters and Chu [Nature {\\bf 463},\n926-929 (2010)] argued that atom interferometers also provide a very accurate\ntest of the gravitational redshift when considering the atom as a clock\noperating at the Compton frequency associated with the rest mass. We analyze\nthis claim in the frame of general relativity and of different alternative\ntheories. We show that the difference of \"Compton phases\" between the two paths\nof the interferometer is actually zero in a large class of theories, including\ngeneral relativity, all metric theories of gravity, most non-metric theories\nand most theoretical frameworks used to interpret the violations of the\nequivalence principle. Therefore, in most plausible theoretical frameworks,\nthere is no redshift effect and atom interferometers only test the universality\nof free fall.

Unfortunately, it is difficult to obtain all of these\ncharacteristics simultaneously. For example, modern transistor amplifiers offer\nmulti-octave bandwidths and excellent dynamic range. However, their noise\nremains far above the fundamental limit set by the uncertainty principle of\nquantum mechanics. Parametric amplifiers, which predate transistor amplifiers\nand are widely used in optics, exploit a nonlinear response to transfer power\nfrom a strong pump tone to a weak signal. If the nonlinearity is purely\nreactive, ie. nondissipative, in theory the amplifier noise can reach the\nquantum-mechanical limit.

{"id": "1210.2353", "contents": "Title: A Flea on Schroedinger's Cat Abstract: We propose a technical reformulation of the measurement problem of quantum\nmechanics, which is based on the postulate that the final state of a\nmeasurement is classical. Unlike the usual formulation (in which the\npost-measurement state is a unit vector in Hilbert space), our version actually\nopens the possibility of admitting a purely technical solution within the\nconfines of conventional quantum theory (as opposed to solutions that either\nmodify this theory, or introduce unusual and controversial interpretative rules\nand/or ontologies). To that effect, we recall a remarkable phenomenon in the\ntheory of Schroedinger operators (discovered in 1981 by Jona-Lasinio et al),\naccording to which the ground state of a symmetric double-well Hamiltonian\nbecomes exponentially sensitive to tiny perturbations of the potential as h ->\n0. We show that this instability emerges also from the textbook WKB\napproximation, extend it to time-dependent perturbations, and study the\ndynamical transition from the ground state of the double well to the perturbed\nground state (in which the cat is typically either dead or alive, depending on\nthe details of the perturbation). Numerical simulations show that adiabatically\narising perturbations may (quite literally) cause the collapse of the\nwave-function in the classical limit. Thus, at least in the context of a simple\nmathematical model, we combine the technical and conceptual virtues of\ndecoherence (which fails to solve the measurement problem but launches the key\nidea that perturbations may come from the environment) with those of dynamical\ncollapse models a la GRW (which do solve the measurement problem but are ad\nhoc), without sharing their drawbacks: single measurement outcomes are obtained\n(instead of merely diagonal reduced density matrices), and no modification of\nquantum mechanics is needed. \n\n"}

This\nprogress is based mostly on a successful isolation of the qubits from external\ndecoherence sources obtained by clever engineering. Under these conditions, the\nmaterial-inherent sources of noise start to play a crucial role. In most cases,\nquantum devices are affected by noise decreasing with frequency, f,\napproximately as 1/f. According to the present point of view, such noise is due\nto material- and device-specific microscopic degrees of freedom interacting\nwith quantum variables of the nanodevice. The simplest picture is that the\nenvironment that destroys the phase coherence of the device can be thought of\nas a system of two-state fluctuators, which experience random hops between\ntheir states.

We mention theoretical and experimental\nefforts to characterize these non-equilibrium quantum systems. We show how\nJosephson junction systems can implement the equivalent of the Kondo effect\nwith microwave photons. The Kondo effect is characterized by a renormalized\nlight-frequency and a peak in the Rayleigh elastic transmission of a photon. We\nalso address the physics of hybrid systems comprising mesoscopic quantum dot\ndevices coupled to an electromagnetic resonator. Then, we discuss extensions to\nQuantum Electrodynamics (QED) Networks allowing to engineer the Jaynes-Cummings\nlattice and Rabi lattice models. This opens the door to novel many-body physics\nwith light out of equilibrium, in relation with the Mott-superfluid transition\nobserved with ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices.

In the\nabove-mentioned article, there lies this contrast, on the one hand, the\ndimensionless quantum uncertainty of the potential box approaches classical\ndispersion only in the limit of large quantum numbers ($n\\to \\infty\n$)-consistent with the correspondence principle. On the other hand, similar\nevaluations for bouncing ball and harmonic oscillator potentials are equal to\ntheir classical counterparts independent of $n$.

Here,\nwe discover a novel quantum criticality at the phase transition by\nincorporating the 1/r long-range Coulomb interaction. Unique interplay between\nthe Coulomb interaction and electronic critical modes enforces not only the\nanisotropic renormalization of the Coulomb interaction but also marginally\nmodified electronic excitation. In connection with experiments, we investigate\nseveral striking effects in physical observables of our novel criticality. \n\n"}

We do this by first\nconstructing a holographic $c$-function using causal horizon in the black brane\ngeometry. The UV value of the $c$-function is $a_{UV}$ and then it decreases\nmonotonically to zero at the curvature singularity. Intuitively, the behavior\nof the $c$-function can be understood if we recognize that the dual CFT is in a\nthermal state and thermal states are effectively massive with a gap set by the\ntemperature. In field theory, logarithmic entanglement negativity is an\nentanglement measure for mixed states. For example, in two dimensional CFTs on\ninfinite line at finite temperature, the renormalized entanglement negativity\nof an interval has UV (Low- T) value $c_{UV}$ and IR (High-T) value zero. So\nthis is a potential candidate for our $c$-function. In four dimensions we\nexpect the same thing to hold on physical grounds. Now since the causal horizon\ngoes behind the black brane horizon the holographic $c$-function is sensitive\nto the physics of the interior. Correspondingly the field theory $c$-function\nshould also contain information about the interior. So our results suggest that\nhigh temperature (IR) expansion of the negativity (or any candidate\n$c$-function) may be a way to probe part of the physics near the singularity.\nNegativity at finite temperature depends on the full operator content of the\ntheory and so perhaps this can be be done in specific cases only.\n  The existence of this $c$-function in the bulk is an extreme example of the\nparadigm that space-time is built out of entanglement. In particular the fact\nthat the $c$-function reaches zero at the curvature singularity correlates the\ntwo facts : loss of quantum entanglement in the IR field theory and the end of\ngeometry in the bulk which in this case is the formation of curvature\nsingularity. \n\n"}

At first order in the interaction energy we\nrecover the usual procedure of projecting the interaction term onto the flat\nband Wannier functions. We show that the BCS wave function is the exact ground\nstate of the projected interaction Hamiltonian and that the compressibility is\ndiverging as a consequence of an emergent $SU(2)$ symmetry. This symmetry is\nbroken by second order interband transitions resulting in a finite\ncompressibility, which we illustrate for a one-dimensional ladder with two\nperfectly flat bands.

This\nconclusion is obtained studying at first specific one-dimensional LR examples,\nin particular their phase diagrams and contents in symmetries and entanglement.\nThe purely long-range phases (LRP) are signaled by the violation of the\narea-law for the Von Neumann entropy and by corresponding peculiar\ndistributions for the entanglement spectrum (ES). The origin of the deviations\nfrom the TWC is analyzed from a more general point of view and in any\ndimension. In particular, it is found related with a particular type of\ndivergences occurring in the spectrum, due to the LR couplings. A satisfying\ncharacterization for the LRP can be achieved at least for one-dimensional\nsystems, as well as the connected definition of a nontrivial topology, provided\na careful evaluation of the LR contributions. Our results lead to reconsider\nthe definition of correlation length in LR systems. The same analysis also\nallows to infer, at least for one-dimensional models, the weakening of the\nbulk-boundary correspondence, due to the important correlations between bulk\nand edges, and consequently to clarify the nature of the massive edge states\nappearing in the topological LR. The emergence of this peculiar edge structure\nis signaled by the bulk ES. The stability of the LRP against finite-size\neffects, relevant in current experiments, and against local disorder is\ndiscussed, showing that the latter ingredient can even strengthen the effect of\nthe LR couplings. Finally, we analyze the entanglement content of the\nparadigmatic LR Ising spin chain, inferring again important deviations from the\nSR regime, and the limitations of bulk-boundary (tensor-network based)\napproaches to classify LR spin models. \n\n"}

However, pinning down the responsible mechanisms is often\ndifficult, since the response to irradiation is governed by complex many-body\ndynamics. In contrast to static systems, where extensive calculations have been\nperformed to explain phenomena such as high-temperature superconductivity,\ntheoretical analyses of driven many-body Hamiltonians are more demanding and\nnew theoretical approaches have been inspired by the recent observations.

Allowing for arbitrary quantum states of both the\ninput reference mode and the output reference mode on which the measurement is\nperformed, we show that the non-unitary transformation operator can be given as\nan $s$-ordered operator product, where the value of $s$ is entirely determined\nby the absolute value of the beam splitter reflectance (or transmittance). The\nformalism generalizes previously obtained results that can be recovered by\nsimple specification of the non-unitary transformation operator. As an\napplication, we consider the generation of Schr\\\"odinger-cat-like states. An\nextension to mixed states and imperfect detection is outlined. \n\n"}

We show that, even in the simplest cases, (i) the existence of a\nconsistent canonical description for such mixed systems is incompatible with\nvery basic requirements related to the time evolution of the two sectors when\nthey are decoupled. (ii) The classical sector cannot inherit quantum\nfluctuations from the quantum sector. And, (iii) a coupling among the two\nsectors is incompatible with the requirement of physical positivity of the\ntheory, i.e., there would be positive observables with a non positive\nexpectation value. \n\n"}

The ladder operator\nformalism and displacement operator formalism of the negative binomial states\nare found and the algebra involved turns out to be the SU(1,1) Lie algebra via\nthe generalized Holstein-Primarkoff realization. These states are essentially\nPeremolov's SU(1,1) coherent states. We reveal their connection with the\ngeometric states and find that they are excited geometric states. As\nintermediate states, they interpolate between the number states and geometric\nstates. We also point out that they can be recognized as the nonlinear coherent\nstates. Their nonclassical properties, such as sub-Poissonian distribution and\nsqueezing effect are discussed. The quasiprobability distributions in phase\nspace, namely the Q and Wigner functions, are studied in detail. We also\npropose two methods of generation of the negative binomial states. \n\n"}

This recognition leads to\nuncertainty principles, stronger than the traditional ones, to be obeyed by all\nseparable states. For all bipartite Gaussian states, the Peres-Horodecki\ncriterion turns out to be necessary and sufficient condition for separability. \n\n"}

Detailed analytical and\nexplicit expressions are given when the coupling of the two modes has an\nharmonic time-dependence. Despite its simplicity the model exhibits a very\nbroad range of intricate physical effects. We show that quantum revivals are\npossible for a broad continuous range of physical parameters in the case of\ninitial Fock states. For coherent states we find that such revivals are\npossible only for certain discrete rational number combinations of the ratio of\nfrequency detuning and pump parameters. Correlation effects are shown to be\nvery sensitive to the initial state of the system. \n\n"}
