Differentiating the master equation yields a new\nexpression for the tilt d(ln Omega_gw(f))/d(ln f). The relationship between r\nand Omega_gw(f) depends sensitively on the uncertain physics of the early\nuniverse, and we show that this uncertainty may be encapsulated (in a\nmodel-independent way) by two quantities: w_hat(f) and nt_hat(f), where\nnt_hat(f) is a certain logarithmic average over nt(k) (the primordial tensor\nspectral index); and w_hat(f) is a certain logarithmic average over w_tilde(a)\n(the effective equation-of-state in the early universe, after horizon\nre-entry).

At each instant the true\nworldline is assumed to lie tangent to a reference geodesic, called an\nosculating orbit, such that the worldline evolves smoothly from one such\ngeodesic to the next. Because a geodesic is uniquely identified by a set of\nconstant orbital elements, the transition between osculating orbits corresponds\nto an evolution of the elements. In this paper we derive the evolution\nequations for a convenient set of orbital elements, assuming that the force\nacts only within the orbital plane; this is the only restriction that we impose\non the formalism, and we do not assume that the force must be small.

They are based on ideas of Weyl,\nEddington and Einstein and, in particular, on Einstein's proposal to specify\nthe space - time geometry by use of the Hamilton principle. More specifically,\nthe connection coefficients are derived by varying a `geometric' Lagrangian\nthat is supposed to be an arbitrary function of the generalized (non-symmetric)\nRicci curvature tensor (and, possibly, of other fundamental tensors) expressed\nin terms of the connection coefficients regarded as independent variables. In\naddition to the standard Einstein gravity, such a theory predicts dark energy\n(the cosmological constant, in the first approximation), a neutral massive (or,\ntachyonic) vector field, and massive (or, tachyonic) scalar fields. These\nfields couple only to gravity and may generate dark matter and/or inflation.\nThe masses (real or imaginary) have geometric origin and one cannot avoid their\nappearance in any concrete model.

This outcome, coupled\nwith recent theoretical results concerning the detectability of very nearly\nflat universes, is sufficient to exclude a detectable non-trivial cosmic\ntopology for most observers in the inflationary limit ($0< |\\Omega_{tot}-1|\n\\lesssim 10^{-5}$). In a recent paper we have studied the consequences of these\nsearches for circles if the Universe turns out to be exactly flat\n($\\Omega_{tot} = 1 $) as is often assumed. More specifically, we have derived\nthe maximum angles of deviation possible from antipodicity of pairs of matching\ncircles associated with the shortest closed geodesic for all multiply-connected\nflat orientable $3$-manifolds. These upper bounds on the deviation from\nantipodicity demonstrate that in a flat universe for some classes of topology\nthere remains a substantial fraction of observers for whom the deviation from\nantipodicity of the matching circles is considerably larger than zero, which\nimplies that the searches for circles-in-the-sky undertaken so far are not\nenough to exclude the possibility of a detectable non-trivial flat topology.\nHere we briefly review these results and discuss their consequences in the\nsearch for circles-in-the-sky in a flat universes. \n\n"}

In the test-mass limit,\nwell-defined ISCO conditions exist for the Kerr and Schwarzschild spacetimes.\nIn the finite-mass case, there are a large variety of ways to define an ISCO in\na post-Newtonian (PN) context. Here I generalize the gauge-invariant ISCO\ncondition of Blanchet & Iyer (2003) to the case of spinning (nonprecessing)\nbinaries. The Blanchet-Iyer ISCO condition has two desirable and unexpected\nproperties: (1) it exactly reproduces the Schwarzschild ISCO in the test-mass\nlimit, and (2) it accurately approximates the recently-calculated shift in the\nSchwarzschild ISCO frequency due to the conservative-piece of the gravitational\nself-force [Barack & Sago (2009)]. The generalization of this ISCO condition to\nspinning binaries has the property that it also exactly reproduces the Kerr\nISCO in the test-mass limit (up to the order at which PN spin corrections are\ncurrently known). The shift in the ISCO due to the spin of the test-particle is\nalso calculated. Remarkably, the gauge-invariant PN ISCO condition exactly\nreproduces the ISCO shift predicted by the Papapetrou equations for a\nfully-relativistic spinning particle. It is surprising that an analysis of the\nstability of the standard PN equations of motion is able (without any form of\n\"resummation\") to accurately describe strong-field effects of the Kerr\nspacetime.

Here we\nfurther develop a practical `$m$-mode regularization' scheme for SF\ncalculations, and give details of a first implementation. The key steps in the\nmethod are (i) removal of a singular part of the perturbation field with a\nsuitable `puncture' to leave a sufficiently regular residual within a finite\nworldtube surrounding the particle's worldline, (ii) decomposition in azimuthal\n($m$-)modes, (iii) numerical evolution of the $m$-modes in 2+1D with a finite\ndifference scheme, and (iv) reconstruction of the SF from the mode sum. The\nmethod relies on a judicious choice of puncture, based on the\nDetweiler--Whiting decomposition.

Of course this\napproach can only be applied whenever there is a newtonian limit, and the\nlatter is related to the GR solution that is generalized by a given ST solution\nunder consideration. This procedure thus assumes two hypothesis: On the one\nhand, that there should be a weak field limit of the GR solution; On the other\nhand that the latter corresponds to the limit case of given ST solution. In the\npresent work we consider a ST solution with negative spatial curvature. It\ngeneralizes a general relativistic solution known as being of a degenerate\nclass (A) for its unusual properties. In particular, the GR solution does not\nexhibit the usual weak field limit in the region where the gravitational field\nis static. The absence of a weak field limit for the hyperbolic GR solution\nmeans that such limit is also absent for comparison with the ST solution, and\nthus one cannot barely apply the PPN formalism. We therefore analyse the\nproperties of the hyperbolic ST solution, and discuss the question o defining a\ngeneralised newtonian limit both for the GR solution and for the purpose of\ncontrasting it with the ST solution.

The gravitational\nmass-shift effect is completely described in this case. The masses of the\nmassive particles in the standard model are shown to depend on the value of the\nHiggs boson mass in the flat spacetime. If the Higgs boson mass in the flat\nspacetime is less than 263.6 GeV, then the mass of any massive particle\napproaching a gravitating object grows. If the Higgs boson mass in the flat\nspacetime is greater than or equal to 278.2 GeV, the masses of all the massive\nparticles decrease in a strong gravitational field. The Higgs boson masses\nlying in between these two values prove to lead to instability, at least at the\none-loop level, and so they are excluded. It turns out that the vacuum\npossesses the same properties as an ultrarelativistic fluid in a certain\napproximation. The expression for the pressure, the entropy and enthalpy\ndensities of this fluid are obtained. The sound speed in this fluid is also\nderived. \n\n"}

The limit (i) gives rise to a ``velocity kick'' on distant test\nparticles in the scalar and electromagnetic cases, and it gives rise to a\n``memory effect'' (i.e., a permanent change in relative separation of two test\nparticles) in the linearized gravitational case, in agreement with previous\nanalyses.

A\ncharged or massive particle moving in a curved background space-time produces a\nfield that affects its motion, pushing it off its expected geodesic. This\nself-field gives rise to a so-called self-force acting on the particle. In\nmodelling this motion, the self-force approach uses a perturbative expansion in\nthe mass ratio. One of the most interesting sources of gravitational waves are\nextreme mass ratio inspirals - systems perfectly suited to self-force\nmodelling. One of the key problems within the self-force model is the\ndivergence of the field at the particle. To resolve this, the field is split\ninto a singular component and a smooth regular field. This regular-singular\nsplit, introduced by Detweiler and Whiting, is used in most modern self-force\ncalculations. In this thesis, we derive high-order expansions of the\nDetweiler-Whiting singular field, and use these to push the boundaries on\ncurrent precision limits of self-force calculations. Within the mode-sum\nscheme, we give over 14 previously unknown regularisation parameters, almost\ndoubling the current regularisation parameter database.

Here we present a wide survey of the\ncorrections due to these effects in two situations of great interest for GW\nastronomy: the black hole (BH) ringdown emission and the inspiral of two\ncompact objects. We take into account various effects such as: electric\ncharges, magnetic fields, cosmological evolution, possible deviations from\nGeneral Relativity, firewalls, and various forms of matter such as accretion\ndisks and dark matter halos. Our analysis predicts the existence of resonances\ndictated by the external mass distribution, which dominate the very late-time\nbehavior of merger/ringdown waveforms. The mode structure can drastically\ndiffer from the vacuum case, yet the BH response to external perturbations is\nunchanged at the time scales relevant for detectors.

For energy densities\nhigher than the new mass scale of the theory, a gravitating dust component is\nshown to generically induce an accelerated expansion of the Universe. Within\nsuch a simple scenario, inflation gracefully exits when the GR regime is\nrecovered, but the Universe would remain matter dominated. In order to\nimplement a reheating era after inflation, we then consider inflation to be\ndriven by a mixture of unstable dust species decaying into radiation. Because\nthe speed of sound gravitates within the Born-Infeld model under consideration,\nour scenario ends up being predictive on various open questions of the\ninflationary paradigm. The total number of e-folds of acceleration is given by\nthe lifetime of the unstable dust components and is related to the duration of\nreheating. As a result, inflation does not last much longer than the number of\ne-folds of deceleration allowing a small spatial curvature and large scale\ndeviations to isotropy to be observable today. Energy densities are\nself-regulated as inflation can only start for a total energy density less than\na threshold value, again related to the species' lifetime. Above this\nthreshold, the Universe may bounce thereby avoiding a singularity. Another\ndistinctive feature is that the accelerated expansion is of the\nsuperinflationary kind, namely the first Hubble flow function is negative.

Abstract: We consider the nature of quantum properties in non-relativistic quantum\nmechanics (QM) and relativistic QFTs, and examine the connection between formal\nquantization schemes and intuitive notions of wave-particle duality. Based on\nthe map between classical Poisson brackets and their associated commutators,\nsuch schemes give rise to quantum states obeying canonical dispersion\nrelations, obtained by substituting the de Broglie relations into the relevant\n(classical) energy-momentum relation. In canonical QM, this yields a dispersion\nrelation involving $\\hbar$ but not $c$, whereas the canonical relativistic\ndispersion relation involves both. Extending this logic to the canonical\nquantization of the gravitational field gives rise to loop quantum gravity, and\na map between classical variables containing $G$ and $c$, and associated\ncommutators involving $\\hbar$. This naturally defines a \"wave-gravity duality\",\nsuggesting that a quantum wave packet describing {\\it self-gravitating matter}\nobeys a dispersion relation involving $G$, $c$ and $\\hbar$. We propose an\nansatz for this relation, which is valid in the semi-Newtonian regime of both\nQM and general relativity.

Because the Alfv\\'en speed\nvaries with distance from the disk, the AWs undergo partial non-WKB reflection,\nand counter-propagating AWs subsequently interact, causing AW energy to cascade\nto small scales and dissipate. To investigate this process, we introduce an\nElsasser-like formulation of general relativistic MHD (GRMHD) and develop the\ntheory of general relativistic reduced MHD in an inhomogeneous medium. We then\nderive a set of equations for the mean-square AW amplitude $M_+$ and turbulent\nheating rate $Q$ under the assumption that, in the plasma rest frame, AWs\npropagating away from the disk are much more energetic than AWs propagating\ntoward the disk. For the case in which the background flow is axisymmetric and\ntime-independent, we solve these equations analytically to determine $M_+$ and\n$Q$ as functions of position. We find that, for an idealized thin disk threaded\nby a large-scale poloidal magnetic field, the AW energy flux is $\\sim\n(\\rho_{\\rm b}/\\rho_{\\rm d})^{1/2} \\beta_{\\rm net,d}^{-1/2}$ times the disk's\nradiative flux, where $\\rho_{\\rm b}$ and $\\rho_{\\rm d}$ are the mass densities\nat the coronal base and disk midplane, respectively, and $\\beta_{\\rm net,d}$ is\nthe ratio (evaluated at the disk midplane) of plasma-plus-radiation pressure to\nthe pressure of the average vertical magnetic field.

For the first time\nwe address:(1)concrete forms of analytic solutions for perturbed EM fields\ncaused by HFGWs having all six possible polarizations in background stable EM\nfields; (2)perturbed EM signals of HFGWs with additional polarizations in\nthree-dimensional-synchro-resonance-system(3DSR system) and in\ngalactic-extragalactic background EM fields. These perturbative EM fields are\nactually EM counterparts of HFGWs, and such results provide a novel way to\nsimultaneously distinguish and display all possible six polarizations. It is\nalso shown: (i)In EM response, pure cross-, x-type and pure y-type\npolarizations can independently generate perturbative photon fluxes(PPFs,\nsignals), while plus-, b- and l-type polarizations produce PPFs in different\ncombination states. (ii) All such six polarizations have separability and\ndetectability.

All these corrections can\npotentially be probed by measuring the stochastic gravitational- wave\nbackground. However, most existing treatments of this background beyond GR\noverlook modifications to the energy carried by gravitational waves, or rely on\nGR assumptions that are invalid in other theories. This may lead to\nmistranslation between the observable cross-correlation of detector outputs and\ngravitational-wave energy density, and thus to errors when deriving\nobservational constraints on theories. In this article, we lay out a generic\nformalism for stochastic gravitational- wave searches, applicable to a large\nfamily of theories beyond GR. We explicitly state the (often tacit) assumptions\nthat go into these searches, evaluating their generic applicability, or lack\nthereof. Examples of problematic assumptions are: statistical independence of\nlinear polarization amplitudes; which polarizations satisfy equipartition; and\nwhich polarizations have well-defined phase velocities. We also show how to\ncorrectly infer the value of the stochastic energy density in the context of\nany given theory. We demonstrate with specific theories in which some of the\ntraditional assumptions break down: Chern-Simons gravity, scalar-tensor theory,\nand Fierz-Pauli massive gravity.

Axions are one particularly\nwell-motivated class of extensions to the Standard Model leading to new forces\nand sources of radiation, which we focus on in this paper. Using an effective\nfield theory (EFT) approach, we calculate the first post-Newtonian corrections\nto the orbital dynamics, radiated power, and gravitational waveform for binary\nneutron star mergers in the presence of an axion. This result is applicable to\nmany theories which add an extra massive scalar degree of freedom to General\nRelativity.

The resonant energy\ntransfer between the orbit and NS speeds up or slows down the inspiral and\ninduces a phase change in the emitted gravitational waves from the binary. A\ntidal resonance, (jk,m), occurs when the mode frequency equals m times the\norbital frequency. For f-mode resonance to occur before coalescence, the NS\nmust have rapid rotation, with spin frequency nu_s>710Hz for (22,2)-resonance\nand nu_s>570Hz for (33,3)-resonance (M=1.4Mo and R=10km; however, for R=15km,\nthese spin frequencies become 330Hz and 250Hz). Because of strong tidal\ncoupling, f-mode resonances induce a large change in the number of orbital\ncycles, N_orb, with maximum N_orb~10-1000 for (22,2)-resonance and N_orb~1 for\n(33,3)- resonance.

{"id": "gr-qc/0503011", "contents": "Title: Binary black hole initial data from matched asymptotic expansions Abstract: We present an approximate metric for a binary black hole spacetime to\nconstruct initial data for numerical relativity. This metric is obtained by\nasymptotically matching a post-Newtonian metric for a binary system to a\nperturbed Schwarzschild metric for each hole. In the inner zone near each hole,\nthe metric is given by the Schwarzschild solution plus a quadrupolar\nperturbation corresponding to an external tidal gravitational field. In the\nnear zone, well outside each black hole but less than a reduced wavelength from\nthe center of mass of the binary, the metric is given by a post-Newtonian\nexpansion including the lowest-order deviations from flat spacetime. When the\nnear zone overlaps each inner zone in a buffer zone, the post-Newtonian and\nperturbed Schwarzschild metrics can be asymptotically matched to each other. By\ndemanding matching (over a 4-volume in the buffer zone) rather than patching\n(choosing a particular 2-surface in the buffer zone), we guarantee that the\nerrors are small in all zones. The resulting piecewise metric is made formally\n$C^\\infty$ with smooth transition functions so as to obtain the finite\nextrinsic curvature of a 3-slice.

The method is related to the Mino, Sasaki, Tanaka and\nQuinn and Wald (MiSaTaQuWa) renormalization and to the Detweiler-Whiting\nconstruction of the singular field. It relies on the fact that the renormalized\n$\\psi_0$ (or $\\psi_4$) is a {\\em sourcefree} solution to the Teukolsky\nequation; and one can therefore reconstruct a nonsingular renormalized metric\nin a radiation gauge. \n\n"}

The observed\nweakness of gravity on distances $\\gsim$ 1 mm is due to the existence of $n\n\\geq 2$ new compact spatial dimensions large compared to the weak scale. The\nPlanck scale $M_{Pl} \\sim G_N^{-1/2}$ is not a fundamental scale; its enormity\nis simply a consequence of the large size of the new dimensions. While\ngravitons can freely propagate in the new dimensions, at sub-weak energies the\nStandard Model (SM) fields must be localized to a 4-dimensional manifold of\nweak scale \"thickness\" in the extra dimensions. This picture leads to a number\nof striking signals for accelerator and laboratory experiments.

The model is applicable for center of mass energies higher than the\nrelevant Planck scale. At impact parameters smaller than the Schwarzchild\nradius appropriate to the center of mass energy and total charge of the initial\nstate, the cross section is dominated by an inelastic process in which a single\nlarge black hole is formed. The black hole then decays by Hawking radiation.\nThe elastic cross section is highly suppressed at these impact parameters\nbecause of the small phase space for thermal decay into a high energy two body\nstate. For very large impact parameter the amplitude is dominated by\neikonalized single graviton exchange. At intermediate impact parameters the\nscattering is more complicated, but since the Schwarzchild radius grows with\nenergy, we speculate that a more sophisticated eikonal calculation which uses\nthe nonlinear classical solutions of the field equations may provide a good\napproximation at all larger impact parameters. We discuss the extent to which\nblack hole production will be observable in theories with low scale quantum\ngravity and large dimensions. \n\n"}

We\nfind that the most general supersymmetric solution is parametrized by six real\nmoduli and analyze its properties using the theory of algebraic curves. In the\ngeneric case, where no continuous subgroup of the original SO(6) symmetry\nremains unbroken, the algebraic curve of the corresponding solution is a\nRiemann surface of genus seven. When some cycles shrink to zero size the\nsymmetry group is enhanced, whereas the genus of the Riemann surface is lowered\naccordingly. The uniformization of the curves is carried out explicitly and\nyields various supersymmetric configurations in terms of elliptic functions. We\nalso analyze the ten-dimensional type-IIB supergravity origin of our solutions\nand show that they represent the gravitational field of a large number of\nD3-branes continuously distributed on hyper-surfaces embedded in the\nsix-dimensional space transverse to the branes. The spectra of massless scalar\nand graviton excitations are also studied on these backgrounds by casting the\nassociated differential equations into Schrodinger equations with non-trivial\npotentials. The potentials are found to be of Calogero type, rational or\nelliptic, depending on the background configuration that is used. \n\n"}
{"id": "hep-th/9909056", "contents": "Title: Quasinormal Modes of AdS Black Holes and the Approach to Thermal\n  Equilibrium Abstract: We investigate the decay of a scalar field outside a Schwarzschild anti de\nSitter black hole. This is determined by computing the complex frequencies\nassociated with quasinormal modes. There are qualitative differences from the\nasymptotically flat case, even in the limit of small black holes. In\nparticular, for a given angular dependence, the decay is always exponential -\nthere are no power law tails at late times. In terms of the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence, a large black hole corresponds to an approximately thermal\nstate in the field theory, and the decay of the scalar field corresponds to the\ndecay of a perturbation of this state. Thus one obtains the timescale for the\napproach to thermal equilibrium. We compute these timescales for the strongly\ncoupled field theories in three, four, and six dimensions which are dual to\nstring theory in asymptotically AdS spacetimes. \n\n"}

Abstract: The rules of quantum mechanics require a time coordinate for their\nformulation. However, a notion of time is in general possible only when a\nclassical spacetime geometry exists. Such a geometry is itself produced by\nclassical matter sources. Thus it could be said that the currently known\nformulation of quantum mechanics pre-assumes the presence of classical matter\nfields. A more fundamental formulation of quantum mechanics should exist, which\navoids having to use a notion of time. In this paper we discuss as to how such\na fundamental formulation could be constructed for single particle,\nnon-relativistic quantum mechanics. We argue that there is an underlying\nnon-linear theory of quantum gravity, to which both standard quantum mechanics\nand classical general relativity are approximations. The timeless formulation\nof quantum mechanics follows from the underlying theory when the mass of the\nparticle is much smaller than Planck mass. On the other hand, when the\nparticle's mass is much larger than Planck mass, spacetime emerges and the\nunderlying theory should reduce to classical mechanics and general relativity.\nWe also suggest that noncommutative differential geometry is a possible\ncandidate for describing this underlying theory. \n\n"}
