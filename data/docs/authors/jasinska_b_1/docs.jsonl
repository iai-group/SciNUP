The main physics justification for such\na device is detection of accelerator generated neutrinos, nucleon decay, and\nnatural sources of neutrinos such as solar, atmospheric and supernova\nneutrinos. In addition to the physics justification there are practical issues\nregarding the existing infrastructure at Homestake, and the stress\ncharacteristics of the Homestake rock formations.\n  The depth requirements associated with the various physics processes are\nreported for water Cherenkov and liquid argon detector technologies.

The feeble nature of these signals requires a strong\nsuppression of backgrounds below a few MeV. Very low intrinsic radiogenic\ncontamination of all detector components needs to be accompanied by the\nefficient identification of muons and of muon-induced backgrounds. Muons\nproduce unstable nuclei by spallation processes along their trajectory through\nthe detector whose decays can mimic the expected signals; for isotopes with\nhalf-lives longer than a few seconds, the dead time induced by a muon-related\nveto becomes unacceptably long, unless its application can be restricted to a\nsub-volume along the muon track. Consequently, not only the identification of\nmuons with very high efficiency but also a precise reconstruction of their\ntracks is of primary importance for the physics program of the experiment.

When these experiments are performed using macro-bolometers,\nradioactive contamination near the surfaces is of particular concern. In order\nto control the effects of surface contamination, we developed a novel technique\nthat uses composite macro-bolometers to identify energy depositions that occur\nclose to the surfaces of materials immediately surrounding the detector. The\ncomposite macro-bolometer proposed and studied here consists of a main energy\nabsorber that is thermally coupled to and entirely surrounded by thin absorbers\nthat act as active shields. Surface energy depositions can be rejected by the\nanalysis of simultaneous signals in the main absorber and the shields.

The separation between the\nspacecraft was 1,000 km, with atom interferometers 200 m long and shades from\nsunlight used at each end. A careful analysis of many error sources was\nincluded, but requirements on the time-stability of both the laser wavefront\naberrations and the atom temperatures in the atom clouds were not investigated.\nAfter including these considerations, the laser wavefront aberration stability\nrequirement to meet the quoted sensitivity level is about 1\\times10-8\nwavelengths, and is far tighter than for LISA. Also, the temperature\nfluctuations between atom clouds have to be less than 1 pK.

However,\nto perform such detection, a given set of parameters has to be retrieved from\nthe recoiling tracks : direction, sense and position in the detector volume. In\norder to optimize the track reconstruction and to fully exploit the data of\nforthcoming directional detectors, we present a likelihood method dedicated to\n3D track reconstruction. This new analysis method is applied to the MIMAC\ndetector. It requires a full simulation of track measurements in order to\ncompare real tracks to simulated ones. We conclude that a good spatial\nresolution can be achieved, i.e. sub-mm in the anode plane and cm along the\ndrift axis. This opens the possibility to perform a fiducialization of\ndirectional detectors. The angular resolution is shown to range between\n20$^\\circ$ to 80$^\\circ$, depending on the recoil energy, which is however\nenough to achieve a high significance discovery of Dark Matter.

Conventionally, this problem is overcome by the use of\nion-gating structures. This method, however, introduces large dead times and\nrestricts trigger rates to a few hundred per second. The ion gate can be\neliminated from the setup by the use of Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) foils for\ngas amplification, which intrinsically suppress the backflow of ions. This\nmakes the continuous operation of a TPC at high rates feasible.\n  In this work, Monte Carlo simulations of the buildup of ion space charge in a\nGEM-based TPC and the correction of the resulting drift distortions are\ndiscussed, based on realistic numbers for the ion backflow in a triple-GEM\namplification stack. A TPC in the future PANDA experiment at FAIR, in which\nantiproton-proton interaction rates up to 2 x 10^7 per second will be reached,\nserves as an example for the experimental environment. The simulations show\nthat space charge densities up to 65 fC per cubic cm are reached, leading to\nelectron drift distortions of up to 10 mm. The application of a laser\ncalibration system to correct these distortions is investigated. Based on full\nsimulations of the detector physics and response, we show that it is possible\nto correct for the drift distortions and to maintain the good momentum\nresolution of the GEM-TPC. \n\n"}

If motion correction is used to correct subject\nmotion occurring during an EPI time series then the receiver contrast will\neffectively move relative to the subject and produce temporal modulations in\nthe image amplitude. This effect, which we will call the RFC-MoCo effect, may\nhave consequences in the analysis and interpretation of fMRI results. There are\nmany potential causes of motion-related noise and systematic error in EPI time\nseries and isolating the RFC-MoCo effect would be difficult. Therefore, we have\nundertaken a simulation of this effect to better understand its severity. The\nsimulations examine this effect for a receive-only single-channel 16-leg\nbirdcage coil and a receive-only 12-channel phased array. In particular we\nstudy: (1) The effect size; (2) Its consequences to the temporal correlations\nbetween signals arising at different spatial locations (spatial-temporal\ncorrelations) as is often calculated in resting state fMRI analyses; and (3)\nIts impact on the temporal signal-to-noise ratio of an EPI time series. We find\nthat signal changes arising from the RFC-MoCo effect are likely to compete with\nBOLD (blood-oxygen-level-dependent) signal changes in the presence of\nsignificant motion, even under the assumption of perfect motion correction.\nConsequently, we find that the RFC-MoCo effect may lead to spurious temporal\ncorrelations across the image space, and that temporal SNR may be degraded with\nincreasing motion. \n\n"}

It must be able\nto perform measurements at low frequencies with no bias to provide an\nadditional observable of interest.\n  Since electrostatic accelerometers suffer a bias, a technological upgrade has\nbeen proposed by Onera.

It is\nthe central tracking device of many experiments, e.g. the ALICE experiment at\nCERN. The necessity of a switching electrostatic gate, which prevents ions\nproduced in the amplification region o MWPCs from entering the drift volume,\nhowever, restricts its application to trigger rates of the order of 1 kHz.\n  Charge amplification by Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) foils instead of\nproportional wires offers an intrinsic suppression of the ion backflow,\nalthough not to the same level as a gating grid. Detailed Monte Carlo\nsimulations have shown that the distortions due to residual space charge from\nback-drifting ions can be limited to a few cm, and thus can be corrected using\nstandard calibration techniques. A prototype GEM-TPC has been built with the\nlargest active volume to date for a detector of this type. It has been\ncommissioned with cosmics and particle beams at the FOPI experiment at GSI, and\nwas employed for a physics measurement with pion beams.\n  For future operation of the ALICE TPC at the CERN LHC beyond 2019, where\nPb-Pb collision rates of 50 kHz are expected, it is planned to replace the\nexisting MWPCs by GEM detectors, operated in a continuous, triggerless readout\nmode, thus allowing an increase in event rate by a factor of 100.

Recently, liquid-xenon scintillation light has been observed from\nelectronic recoils down to 2.1 keV, but without applied electric fields that\nare used in most xenon dark matter searches. Applied electric fields can reduce\nthe scintillation yield by hindering the electron-ion recombination process\nthat produces most of the scintillation photons. We present new results of\nliquid xenon's scintillation emission in response to electronic recoils as low\nas 1.5 keV, with and without an applied electric field. At zero field, a\nreduced scintillation output per unit deposited energy is observed below 10\nkeV, dropping to nearly 40% of its value at higher energies.

In Phase I of the experiment eight semi-coaxial and five BEGe type\ndetectors have been deployed. The latter type is used in this field of research\nfor the first time. All detectors are made from material with enriched ^{76}Ge\nfraction. The experimental sensitivity can be improved by analyzing the pulse\nshape of the detector signals with the aim to reject background events.

The double escape peak (DEP) and Compton edge events of 2.615 MeV\n\\gamma\\ rays from ^{208}Tl decays as well as 2\\nu\\beta\\beta\\ decays of ^{76}Ge\nare used as proxies for 0\\nu\\beta\\beta\\ decay.

Such technology has been proven\nin successful productions of ATLAS and Medipix-based silicon pixel sensors by a\nfew foundries. However, the drawbacks of edgeless sensors are poor radiation\nhardness for ionizing radiation and non-uniform charge collection by edge\npixels. In this work, the radiation hardness of edgeless sensors with different\npolarities has been investigated using Synopsys TCAD with X-ray\nradiation-damage parameters implemented. Results show that if no conventional\nguard ring is present, none of the current designs are able to achieve a high\nbreakdown voltage (typically < 30 V) after irradiation to a dose of ~10 MGy. In\naddition, a charge-collection model has been developed and was used to\ncalculate the charges collected by the edge pixels of edgeless sensors when\nilluminated with X-rays. The model takes into account the electric field\ndistribution inside the pixel sensor, the absorption of X-rays, drift and\ndiffusion of electrons and holes, charge sharing effect, and threshold settings\nin ASICs.

For various realistic scenarios, the noise levels\npredicted from this model are comparable to those observed in trapped-ion\nexperiments. Thus, these findings are of particular importance for the\nunderstanding and mitigation of unwanted heating and decoherence in\nminiaturized ion traps. \n\n"}

To this aim, in the last\ndecade, geophysical radiography techniques using cosmic muon particles have\nbeen proposed. By measuring the differential attenuation of the muon flux as a\nfunction of the amount of rock crossed along different directions, it is\npossible to determine the density distribution of the interior of a volcano. Up\nto now, a number of experiments have been based on the detection of the muon\ntracks crossing hodoscopes, made up of scintillators or nuclear emulsion\nplanes. Using telescopes based on the atmospheric Cherenkov imaging technique,\nwe propose a new approach to study the interior of volcanoes detecting the\nCherenkov light produced by relativistic cosmic-ray muons that survive after\ncrossing the volcano. The Cherenkov light produced along the muon path is\nimaged as a typical annular pattern containing all the essential information to\nreconstruct particle direction and energy. Our new approach offers the\nadvantage of a negligible background and an improved spatial resolution. To\ntest the feasibility of our new method, we have carried out simulations with a\ntoy-model based on the geometrical parameters of ASTRI SST-2M, i.e. the imaging\natmospheric Cherenkov telescope currently under installation onto the Etna\nvolcano.

However, the inevitable momentum spread of secondary ions\nlimits the precision of nuclear masses determined by using IMS.

A problematic\nbackground in such large granular detector arrays is posed by alpha particles.\nIn the Majorana Demonstrator, events have been observed that are consistent\nwith energy- degraded alphas originating on the passivated surface, leading to\na potential background contribution in the region-of-interest for neutrinoless\ndouble-beta decay. However, it is also observed that when energy deposition\noccurs very close to the passivated surface, charges drift through the bulk\nonto that surface, and then drift along it with greatly reduced mobility. This\nleads to both a reduced prompt signal and a measurable change in slope of the\ntail of a recorded pulse.

The extreme sensitivity required to make such detections is\nachieved through exquisite isolation of all sensitive components of LIGO from\nnon-gravitational-wave disturbances. Nonetheless, LIGO is still susceptible to\na variety of instrumental and environmental sources of noise that contaminate\nthe data. Of particular concern are noise features known as glitches, which are\ntransient and non-Gaussian in their nature, and occur at a high enough rate so\nthat accidental coincidence between the two LIGO detectors is non-negligible.\nIn this paper we describe an innovative project that combines crowdsourcing\nwith machine learning to aid in the challenging task of categorizing all of the\nglitches recorded by the LIGO detectors. Through the Zooniverse platform, we\nengage and recruit volunteers from the public to categorize images of glitches\ninto pre-identified morphological classes and to discover new classes that\nappear as the detectors evolve. In addition, machine learning algorithms are\nused to categorize images after being trained on human-classified examples of\nthe morphological classes. Leveraging the strengths of both classification\nmethods, we create a combined method with the aim of improving the efficiency\nand accuracy of each individual classifier. The resulting classification and\ncharacterization should help LIGO scientists to identify causes of glitches and\nsubsequently eliminate them from the data or the detector entirely, thereby\nimproving the rate and accuracy of gravitational-wave observations. We\ndemonstrate these methods using a small subset of data from LIGO's first\nobserving run. \n\n"}

The instrument\ndesign uses a single, nearly contiguous volume of organic scintillator that is\ninternally subdivided only as necessary to create optically isolated pillars.\nScintillation light emitted in a given pillar is confined to that pillar by a\ncombination of total internal reflection and a specular reflector applied to\nthe four sides of the pillar transverse to its long axis. The scintillation\nlight is collected at each end of the pillar using a photodetector. In this\noptically segmented design, the (x, y) position of scintillation light emission\n(where the x and y coordinates are transverse to the long axis of the pillars)\nis estimated as the pillar's (x, y) position in the scintillator \"block\", and\nthe z-position (the position along the pillar's long axis) is estimated from\nthe amplitude and relative timing of the signals produced by the photodetectors\nat each end of the pillar. For proton recoils greater than 1 MeV, we show that\nthe (x, y, z)-position of neutron-proton scattering can be estimated with < 1\ncm root-mean-squared [RMS] error and the proton recoil energy can be estimated\nwith < 50 keV RMS error by fitting the photodetectors' response time history to\nmodels of optical photon transport within the scintillator pillars.

While these\nbackgrounds are conventionally mitigated with position cuts, these cuts reduce\nthe exposure of the detector by decreasing the sensitive mass, and uncertainty\nin position determination may make it impossible to adequately remove such\nevents in certain detectors. In this paper, we provide a new technique for\nsubstantially reducing these surface backgrounds in liquid argon (LAr)\ndetectors, independent of position cuts. These detectors typically use a\ncoating of tetraphenyl-butadiene (TPB) on the inner surfaces as a wavelength\nshifter to convert vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) LAr scintillation light to the\nvisible spectrum. We find that TPB scintillation contains a component with a\npreviously unreported exceptionally long lifetime ($\\sim$ms). We discovered\nthat this component differs significantly in magnitude between alpha, beta, and\nVUV excitation, which enables the use of pulse shape discrimination to suppress\nsurface backgrounds by more than a factor of $10^3$ with negligible loss of\ndark matter sensitivity.

Also the UCN\ntransparency of the bulk sD_2 material must be high because crystal\ninhomogeneities limit the mean free path for elastic scattering and reduce the\nextraction efficiency. Observations at the UCN sources at Paul Scherrer\nInstitute and at Los Alamos National Laboratory consistently show a decrease of\nthe UCN yield with time of operation after initial preparation or later\ntreatment (`conditioning') of the sD_2. We show that, in addition to the\nquality of the bulk sD_2, the quality of its surface is essential.

FASER will detect new particles that decay\nwithin a cylindrical volume with radius R= 10 cm and length L = 1.5 m.

A European Perspective Abstract: The International Linear Collider (ILC) being proposed in Japan is an\nelectron-positron linear collider with an initial energy of 250 GeV. The ILC\naccelerator is based on the technology of superconducting radio-frequency\ncavities. This technology has reached a mature stage in the European XFEL\nproject and is now widely used. The ILC will start by measuring the Higgs\nproperties, providing high-precision and model-independent determinations of\nits parameters. The ILC at 250 GeV will also search for direct new physics in\nexotic Higgs decays and in pair-production of weakly interacting particles. The\nuse of polarised electron and positron beams opens new capabilities and\nscenarios that add to the physics reach. The ILC can be upgraded to higher\nenergy, enabling precision studies of the top quark and measurement of the top\nYukawa coupling and the Higgs self-coupling. The international -- including\nEuropean -- interest for the project is very strong.

This\nstraightforward mounting results in three important improvements: (1) it\ndecreases the amount of non-active materials needed to assemble the detector,\n(2) it substantially increases the light collection efficiency by minimizing\nthe light losses induced by the mounting structure, and (3) it enhances the\nthermal signal induced in the light detector thanks to the extremely weak\nthermal link to the thermal bath. We tested this new technique with a 16 cm$^2$\nGe light detector with thermistor readout sitting on the surface of a large\nTeO$_2$ bolometer. The light collection efficiency was increased by greater\nthan 50\\% compared to previously tested alternative mountings.

For sensors irradiated to Phi=5.9x10^14\nn/cm^2 a position resolution below 15 um can be achieved after calibration. \n\n"}

Attaining the target sensitivity requires maintaining an electric field\nof several tens of kilovolts per centimeter across the experimental cell, which\nis nominally 7.5 cm wide and will contain about 4 liters of superfluid. The\nelectrical properties of liquid helium are expected to be sufficient to meet\nthe design goals, but little is known about these properties for volumes and\nelectrode spacings appropriate to the EDM experiment. Furthermore, direct\napplication of the necessary voltages from an external source to the\nexperimental test cell is impractical. An apparatus to amplify voltages in the\nliquid helium environment and to test the electrical properties of the liquid\nfor large volumes and electrode spacings has been constructed. The device\nconsists of a large-area parallel plate capacitor immersed in a 200 liter\nliquid helium dewar. Preliminary results show the breakdown strength of normal\nstate liquid helium is at least 90 kV/cm at these volumes, at the helium vapor\npressure corresponding to 4.38 K. These fields hold for more than 11 hours with\nleakage currents less than 170 pA (about 20% of the maximum tolerable in the\nEDM experiment). The system is also found to be robust against anticipated\nradiation backgrounds. Preliminary results for superfluid show that fields of\nat least 30 kV/cm can be sustained at the volumes required for the EDM\nexperiment, about 60% of the design goal. These results are likely limited by\nthe low pressure that must be maintained above the superfluid bath. \n\n"}

About an order\nof magnitude reduction in ion back-flow is achieved by diverting back-drifting\nions from their original path. A R-MHSP/2GEM/MHSP cascaded multiplier operated\nat total gain of ~1.5*10^5 yielded ion back-flow fractions of 0.0015 and\n0.0004, at drift fields of 0.5 and 0.1 kV/cm, respectively.

{"id": "physics/0610285", "contents": "Title: Ultimate parameters of the photon collider at the ILC Abstract: At linear colliders, the e+e- luminosity is limited by beam-collision\neffects, which determine the required emittances of beams in damping rings\n(DRs). While in gamma-gamma collisions at the photon collider, these effects\nare absent, and so smaller emittances are desirable. In present damping rings\ndesigns, nominal DR parameters correspond to those required for e+e-\ncollisions. In this note, I would like to stress once again that as soon as we\nplan the photon-collider mode of ILC operation, the damping-ring emittances are\ndictated by the photon-collider requirements--namely, they should be as small\nas possible. This can be achieved by adding more wigglers to the DRs; the\nincremental cost is easily justified by a considerable potential improvement of\nthe gamma-gamma luminosity. No expert analysis exists as of yet, but it seems\nrealistic to obtain a factor five increase of the gamma-gamma luminosity\ncompared to the ``nominal'' DR design. \n\n"}
