In contrast, in situation of sublattice symmetry breaking, stable\nferri(o)magnetic states are obtained. For hydrogen-passivated nanomesh, the\nformation energy is dramatically decreased, and ground state is found to\nstrongly depend on the vacancies shape and size. For triangular shaped holes,\nthe obtained net magnetic moments increase with the number difference of\nremoved A and B sites in agreement with Lieb's theorem for even A+B. For odd\nA+B triangular meshes and all cases of non-triangular nanomeshes including the\none with even A+B, Lieb's theorem does not hold anymore which can be partially\nattributed to introduction of armchair edges.

Here we discuss two\nfundamental flaws in the definition of these parameters that significantly\naffect their interpretation for studies of disordered systems, and offer a\nremedy. First, the definition of the bond-orientational order parameters\nconsiders the geometrical arrangement of a set of neighboring spheres NN(p)\naround a given central particle p; we show that procedure to select the spheres\nconstituting the neighborhood NN(p) can have greater influence on both the\nnumerical values and qualitative trend of ql than a change of the physical\nparameters, such as packing fraction.

In particular, when the tube is force-free the\nTA mode frequencies vary quadratically with wave number and have curvature\n(second derivative) proportional to the square-root of the nanotube's bending\nstiffness. When the tube has non-zero external force, the TA mode frequencies\nvary linearly with wave number and have slope proportional to the square-root\nof the axial force. Therefore, the TA phonon curves -- and associated transport\nproperties -- are not material properties but rather can be directly tuned by\nexternal loads.

Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical and numerical investigation of the\nfollowing practical question: Should the time difference quotients of the\nsnapshots be used to generate the proper orthogonal decomposition basis\nfunctions? The answer to this question is important, since some published\nnumerical studies use the time difference quotients, whereas other numerical\nstudies do not. The criterion used in this paper to answer this question is the\nrate of convergence of the error of the reduced order model with respect to the\nnumber of proper orthogonal decomposition basis functions. Two cases are\nconsidered: the no_DQ case, in which the snapshot difference quotients are not\nused, and the DQ case, in which the snapshot difference quotients are used. The\nerror estimates suggest that the convergence rates in the $C^0(L^2)$-norm and\nin the $C^0(H^1)$-norm are optimal for the DQ case, but suboptimal for the\nno_DQ case. The convergence rates in the $L^2(H^1)$-norm are optimal for both\nthe DQ case and the no_DQ case. Numerical tests are conducted on the heat\nequation and on the Burgers equation. The numerical results support the\nconclusions drawn from the theoretical error estimates.

Seeing as the Kondo\ngap arises from many body electronic correlations, this would place SmB6 at the\nhead of a new material class: topological Kondo insulators.

One group of these states is essentially of bulk origin, and cuts\nthe Fermi level due to the position of the chemical potential 20 meV above the\nlowest lying 5d-4f hybridisation zone.

The block coordinate\ndescent/update (BCD) method, on the other hand, handles problems with multiple\nblocks of variables by updating them one at a time; when the blocks of\nvariables are easier to update individually than together, BCD has a lower\nper-iteration cost. This paper introduces a method that combines the features\nof SG and BCD for problems with many components in the objective and with\nmultiple (blocks of) variables.\n  Specifically, a block stochastic gradient (BSG) method is proposed for\nsolving both convex and nonconvex programs. At each iteration, BSG approximates\nthe gradient of the differentiable part of the objective by randomly sampling a\nsmall set of data or sampling a few functions from the sum term in the\nobjective, and then, using those samples, it updates all the blocks of\nvariables in either a deterministic or a randomly shuffled order.

How to rapidly\ncompute this representation in the first place is much less well understood.\nThe present paper demonstrates that if an $N\\times N$ matrix can be applied to\na vector in $O(N)$ time, and if the ranks of the off-diagonal blocks are\nbounded by an integer $k$, then the cost for constructing a HODLR\nrepresentation is $O(k^{2}\\,N\\,(\\log N)^{2})$, and the cost for constructing an\nHBS representation is $O(k^{2}\\,N\\,\\log N)$.

Developing a\ncontinuum theory of dislocations requires the solution of two long standing\nproblems: (i) to represent dislocation kinematics in terms of a reasonable\nnumber of variables and (ii) to derive averaged descriptions of the dislocation\ndynamics (i.e. material laws) in terms of these variables. The kinematic\nproblem (i) was recently solved through the introduction of continuum\ndislocation dynamics (CDD), which provides kinematically consistent evolution\nequations of dislocation alignment tensors, presuming a given average\ndislocation velocity (Hochrainer (2015), Philos. Mag. 95 (12), 1321--1367). In\nthe current paper we demonstrate how a free energy formulation may be used to\nsolve the dynamic closure problem (ii) in CDD.

In crystals with\nhidden polarizations, a uniform electric field produces a staggered magnetic\nfield that points to opposite directions at atomic sites related by spatial\ninversion.

The spintronics explores the spin degree of electrons\nand thus bypasses the heat, at least in principle. For this reason, spin-based\ntechnology offers a possible solution. In this review, we survey some of latest\ndevelopments in all-optical switching (AOS), where ultrafast laser pulses are\nable to reverse spins from one direction to the other deterministically. But\nAOS only occurs in a special group of magnetic samples and within a narrow\nwindow of laser parameters. Some samples need multiple pulses to switch spins,\nwhile others need a single-shot pulse.

Here we\ndemonstrate that large third-order nonlinearities can also be generally\nobtained by a different strategy: As any of the incident frequencies or the sum\nof any two or three frequencies approaches zero, the doped or excited\npopulations of electronic states lead to divergent contributions in the induced\ncurrent density. We refer to these as intraband divergences, by analogy with\nthe behavior of Drude conductivity in linear response. Physically, such\nresonant processes can be associated with a combination of inraband and\ninterband optical transitions.

For linear problems, the local solutions with\nconstraints are used as basis functions. This technique is called Constraint\nEnergy Minimizing Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method (CEM-GMsFEM).\nGMsFEM identifies macroscopic quantities based on rigorous analysis. In\ncorresponding upscaling methods, the multiscale basis functions are selected\nsuch that the degrees of freedom have physical meanings, such as averages of\nthe solution on each continuum.\n  This paper extends the linear concepts to nonlinear problems, where the local\nproblems are nonlinear. The main concept consists of: (1) identifying\nmacroscopic quantities; (2) constructing appropriate oversampled local problems\nwith coarse-grid constraints; (3) formulating macroscopic equations.

This practice improves the\noriginal operator splitting approach in the Monte Carlo method, such as the\nseparated treatment of particle transport and collision. As a result, with the\nvariation of the ratio between numerical time step and local photon's collision\ntime, different transport physics can be fully captured in a single\ncomputation. In the diffusive limit, the UGKP method could recover the solution\nof the diffusion equation with the cell size and time step being much larger\nthan the photon's mean free path and the mean collision time.

The nonlinearity in the diffusion term of the SPDEs is\nassumed to be globally Lipschitz and the nonlinearity in the drift term is only\nassumed to satisfy a one-side Lipschitz condition. The semilinear SPDEs\nconsidered in this paper is a direct generalization of the SODEs considered in\n[13]. There are several difficulties which need to be overcome for this\ngeneralization. First, obviously the spatial discretization, which does not\nappear in the SODE case, adds an extra layer of difficulty. It turns out a\nspecial discretization must be designed to guarantee certain properties for the\nnumerical scheme and its stiffness matrix. In this paper we use a finite\nelement interpolation technique to discretize the nonlinear drift term. Second,\nin order to prove the strong convergence of the proposed fully discrete finite\nelement method, stability estimates for higher order moments of the\n$H^1$-seminorm of the numerical solution must be established, which are\ndifficult and delicate.

We particularly consider the\nspace-time formulation of the fixed-stress iterative scheme, in which we first\nsolve the problem of flow over the whole space-time interval, then exploiting\nthe space-time information for solving the mechanics. Two common\ndiscretizations of this algorithm are then introduced based on two coupled\nmixed finite element methods in-space and the backward Euler scheme in-time.\nTherefrom, adaptive fixed-stress algorithms are build on conforming\nreconstructions of the pressure and displacement together with equilibrated\nflux and stresses reconstructions. These ingredients are used to derive a\nposteriori error estimates for the fixed-stress algorithms, distinguishing the\ndifferent error components, namely the spatial discretization, the temporal\ndiscretization, and the fixed-stress iteration components. Precisely, at the\niteration $k\\geq 1$ of the adaptive algorithm, we prove that our estimate gives\na guaranteed and fully computable upper bound on the energy-type error\nmeasuring the difference between the exact and approximate pressure and\ndisplacement.

The consistent transport scheme\npreserves the numerical stability of the method in the presence of large\ndensity ratios found in problems involving air, water, and an immersed\nstructure. The air-water interface is captured by the level set method on an\nEulerian grid, whereas the free-surface piercing immersed structure is\nrepresented on a Lagrangian mesh.

The relative strength of the exchange and\nelectron-phonon interactions determines whether the transition is first or\nsecond order. A giant drop in the number of current carriers during the\ntransition, which is a consequence of local bound pair (bipolaron) formation in\nthe paramagnetic phase, is extremely sensitive to an external magnetic field.\nBelow the critical temperature of the transition, $T_c$, the binding of the\npolarons into immobile pairs competes with the ferromagnetic exchange between\npolarons and the localized spins on Mn ions, which tends to align the polaron\nmoments and, therefore, breaks up those pairs. The number of carriers abruptly\nincreases below $T_c$ leading to a sudden drop in resistivity. We show that the\ncarrier density collapse describes the colossal magnetoresistance of doped\nmanganites close to the transition.\n  Below $T_c$, transport occurs by polaronic tunneling, whereas at high\ntemperatures the transport is by hopping processes.
