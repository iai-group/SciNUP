In particular, it must explain how\nan initial singularity is avoided, and also how the initial conditions for\nInflation were established.

Abstract: One of the celebrated results of Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) is the\ndiscreteness of the spectrum of geometrical operators such as length, area and\nvolume operators. This is an indication that Planck scale geometry in LQG is\ndiscontinuous rather than smooth. However, there is no rigorous proof thereof\nat present, because the afore mentioned operators are not gauge invariant, they\ndo not commute with the quantum constraints. The relational formalism in the\nincarnation of Rovelli's partial and complete observables provides a possible\nmechanism for turning a non gauge invariant operator into a gauge invariant\none. In this paper we investigate whether the spectrum of such a physical, that\nis gauge invariant, observable can be predicted from the spectrum of the\ncorresponding gauge variant observables. We will not do this in full LQG but\nrather consider much simpler examples where field theoretical complications are\nabsent. We find, even in those simpler cases, that kinematical discreteness of\nthe spectrum does not necessarily survive at the gauge invariant level. Whether\nor not this happens depends crucially on how the gauge invariant completion is\nperformed. This indicates that ``fundamental discreteness at Planck scale in\nLQG'' is far from established.

An upper bound on the time it takes for the\nenergy initially stored in the inflaton field to convert into fluctuations is\nobtained by neglecting the local fluctuations produced during the period of\ntachyonic decay and analyzing the decay of the residual homogeneous field\noscillations, which proceeds by parametric resonance.

This Regge Calculus (RC) is strikingly\ndifferent from the more usual finite difference and finite element\ndiscretizations of gravity. In RC the fundamental principles of General\nRelativity are applied directly to a tessellated spacetime geometry. In this\nmanuscript, and in the spirit of this conference, we reexamine the foundations\nof RC and emphasize the central role that the Voronoi and Delaunay lattices\nplay in this discrete theory. In particular we describe, for the first time, a\ngeometric construction of the scalar curvature invariant at a vertex. This\nderivation makes use of a new fundamental lattice cell built from elements\ninherited from both the simplicial (Delaunay) spacetime and its circumcentric\ndual (Voronoi) lattice.

To emphasize the infrared\naspect of the anomaly, we use a dispersive approach and show that this\namplitude and the existence of the massless scalar pole is determined\ncompletely by its ultraviolet finite terms, together with the requirements of\nPoincare invariance of the vacuum, Bose symmetry under interchange of J^a and\nJ^b, and vector current and stress tensor conservation. We derive a sum rule\nfor the appropriate positive spectral function corresponding to the\ndiscontinuity of the triangle amplitude, showing that it becomes proportional\nto delta function of k^2, and therefore contains a massless scalar intermediate\nstate in the conformal limit of zero electron mass. The effective action\ncorresponding to the trace of the triangle amplitude can be expressed in local\nform by the introduction of two scalar auxiliary fields which satisfy massless\nwave equations. These massless scalar degrees of freedom couple to classical\nsources, contribute to gravitational scattering processes, and can have long\nrange gravitational effects. \n\n"}

We showed recently[1] that the naked singularities that form due\nto gravitational collapse of massive stars provide a suitable environment where\nparticles could get accelerated and collide at arbitrarily high center of mass\nenergies. However, we focussed there only on the spherically symmetric\ngravitational collapse models, which were also assumed to be self-similar. In\nthis paper, we broaden and generalize the result to all gravitational collapse\nmodels leading to the formation of a naked singularity as final state of\ncollapse, evolving from a regular initial data, without making any prior\nrestrictive assumptions about the spacetime symmetries such as above. We show\nthat when the particles interact and collide near the Cauchy horizon, the\nenergy of collision in the center of mass frame will be arbitrarily high, thus\noffering a window to the Planck scale physics. We also consider the issue of\nvarious possible physical mechanisms of generation of such very high energy\nparticles from the vicinity of naked singularity. We then construct a model of\ngravitational collapse to a timelike naked singularity to demonstrate the\nworking of these ideas, where the pressure is allowed to be negative but the\nenergy conditions are respected. We show that a finite amount of mass-energy\ndensity has to be necessarily radiated away from the vicinity of the naked\nsingularity as the collapse evolves. Therefore the nature of naked\nsingularities, both at classical and quantum level could play an important role\nin the process of particle acceleration, explaining the occurrence of highly\nenergetic outgoing particles in the vicinity of Cauchy horizon that participate\nin extreme high energy collisions. \n\n"}

LambdaWDM simulations with keV particles remarkably reproduce the\nobservations, small and large structures and velocity functions. Cored DM halos\nand WDM are clearly determined from theory and astronomical observations, they\nnaturally produce the observed structures at all scales. keV sterile neutrinos\nare the leading candidates, they naturally appear extensions of the standard\nmodel of particle physics. Astrophysical constraints including Lyman alpha\nbounds put its mass in the range 1< m <13 keV. Predictions for EUCLID and\nPLANCK have been presented. MARE and an adapted KATRIN experiment could detect\na keV sterile neutrino. It will be a fantastic discovery to detect dark matter\nin a beta decay. A formidable WDM work to perform is ahead of us, these\nhighlights point out some relevant research directions to put the effort.\nPhotos of the Workshop are included (Abridged). \n\n"}

Typically, such points are\nembedded into low-acceleration bubbles where modified gravity theories a` la\nMOND predict significant deviations from Newton's laws.

We describe a version of the SSB\nmechanism in which gravity plays a direct role. We work in the context of\ndiffeomorphism invariant gauge theories, which exist for any non-abelian gauge\ngroup G, and which have second order in derivatives field equations. We show\nthat any (non-trivial) vacuum solution of such a theory gives rise to an\nembedding of the group SU(2) into G, and thus breaks G down to SU(2) times its\ncentralizer in G. The components of the connection charged under SU(2) can then\nbe seen to describe gravitons, with the SU(2) itself playing the role of the\nchiral half of the Lorentz group. Components charged under the centralizer\ndescribe the usual Yang-Mills gauge bosons. The remaining components describe\nmassive particles. This breaking of symmetry explains (in the context of models\nconsidered) how gravity and Yang-Mills can come from a single underlying theory\nwhile being so different in the physics they describe. Further, varying the\nvacuum solution, and thus the embedding of SU(2) into G, one can break the\nYang-Mills gauge group as desired, with massless gauge bosons of one vacuum\nacquiring mass in another. There is no Higgs field in our version of the SSB\nmechanism, the only variable is a connection field. Instead of the symmetry\nbreaking by a dedicated Higgs field pointing in some direction in the field\nspace, our theories break the symmetry by choosing how the group of \"internal\"\ngauge rotations of gravity (the chiral half of the Lorentz group) sits inside\nthe full gauge group. \n\n"}

The\nexistence of these new operators can lead to interesting dynamics for the\nevolution of the universe, including the appearance of new vacuum states. If\nthe universe today exists in a false vacuum, there will be a non-zero\nprobability to tunnel to the true vacuum state of the universe. Should this\ntransition occur elsewhere in the universe, bubbles of true vacuum will\nnucleate and expand outwards. Bubbles that nucleate in the hot dense plasma of\nthe early universe will feel a friction from the plasma that acts against the\nexpansion of the bubble, until the bubble eventually reaches a steady state\nexpansion. Unlike many bubble formation scenarios where the bubble wall\nvelocity rapidly approaches the speed of light, friction from the hot\nprimordial plasma can cause the expanding bubble wall to reach a terminal\nvelocity while gravity waves are free to propagate through the hot dense plasma\nat the speed of light.

The model is embedded in an anisotropic type\nIIB compactification with two exponentially large extra dimensions and\nTeV-scale gravity. The bulk turns out to be nearly supersymmetric since the\nscale of the gravitino mass is of the order of the observed value of the\ncosmological constant. The quintessence field is a modulus parameterising the\nsize of an internal four-cycle which naturally develops a potential of the\norder (gravitino mass)^4, leading to a small dark energy scale without tunings.\nThe mass of the quintessence field is also radiatively stable since it is\nprotected by supersymmetry in the bulk. Moreover, this light scalar couples to\nordinary matter via its mixing with the volume mode. Due to the fact that the\nquintessence field is a flat direction at leading order, this mixing is very\nsmall, resulting in a suppressed coupling to Standard Model particles which\navoids stringent fifth-force constraints. On the other hand, if dark matter is\nrealised in terms of Kaluza-Klein states, unsuppressed couplings between dark\nenergy and dark matter can emerge, leading to a scenario of coupled\nquintessence within string theory.

Delving into this\nframework, a thick braneworld with a cosmological background induced on the\nbrane is here investigated. The respective field equations --- derived from the\nmodel with a warped 5D geometry --- are highly non-linear equations, admitting\na non-trivial solution for the warp factor and the tachyon scalar field as\nwell, in a de Sitter 4D cosmological background. Moreover, the non-linear\ntachyonic scalar field, that generates the brane in complicity with warped\ngravity, has the form of a kink-like configuration. Notwithstanding, the\nnon-linear field equations restricting character does not allow one to easily\nfind thick brane solutions with a decaying warp factor which leads to the\nlocalization of 4D gravity and other matter fields. We derive such a thick\nbrane configuration altogether in this tachyon-gravity setup.

Here, we study generally covariant metric-torsion theories of gravity\npresented more concretely, setting that their Lagrangians are \\emph{manifestly}\ngenerally covariant scalars. It is assumed that Lagrangians depend on metric\ntensor, curvature tensor, torsion tensor and its first and second covariant\nderivatives, besides, on an arbitrary set of other tensor (matter) fields and\ntheir first and second covariant derivatives. Thus, both the standard minimal\ncoupling with the Riemann-Cartan geometry and non-minimal coupling with the\ncurvature and torsion tensors are considered.\n  The studies and results are as follow. (a) A physical interpretation of the\nNoether and Klein identities is examined. It was found that they are the basis\nfor constructing equations of balance of energy-momentum tensors of various\ntypes (canonical, metrical and Belinfante symmetrized). The equations of\nbalance are presented. (b) Using the generalized equations of balance, new\n(generalized) manifestly generally covariant expressions for canonical\nenergy-momentum and spin tensors of the matter fields are constructed.

A plausible complexity measure is then the Kolmogorov complexity of a\ncoarse-grained approximation of the automaton's state, which we dub the\n\"apparent complexity.\" We study this complexity measure, and show analytically\nthat it never becomes large when the liquid particles are non-interacting. By\ncontrast, when the particles do interact, we give numerical evidence that the\ncomplexity reaches a maximum comparable to the \"coffee cup's\" horizontal\ndimension. We raise the problem of proving this behavior analytically. \n\n"}

The mathematical tools of the\nframework are simple and we attempt to highlight all underlying assumptions.\nFour rules are imposed, asserting (1) a limit on the amount of information\navailable to O; (2) the mere existence of complementary information; (3) O's\ntotal amount of information to be preserved in-between interrogations; and, (4)\nO's `catalogue of knowledge' to change continuously in time in-between\ninterrogations and every consistent such evolution to be possible. This\napproach permits a constructive derivation of quantum theory, elucidating how\nthe ensuing independence, complementarity and compatibility structure of O's\nquestions matches that of projective measurements in quantum theory, how\nentanglement and monogamy of entanglement, non-locality and, more generally,\nhow the correlation structure of arbitrarily many qubits and rebits arises. The\nrules yield a reversible time evolution and a quadratic measure, quantifying\nO's information about S.

The reconstruction for arbitrarily\nmany qubits is completed in a companion paper (arXiv:1511.01130) where an\nadditional rule eliminates the rebit case.

It generalizes and unifies previous\nframeworks, including the standard formulation of quantum theory, the convex\noperational framework and Segal's approach to quantum field theory. It is\ncapable of encoding both classical and quantum (field) theories, implements\nspacetime locality in a manifest way and contains the complete modern notion of\nmeasurement in the quantum case. Its mathematical content can be condensed into\na set of axioms that are similar to those of Atiyah and Segal. This is\nsupplemented by two basic rules for extracting probabilities or expectation\nvalues for measurement processes. The framework, called the positive formalism,\nis derived in three completely different ways. One derivation is from first\nprinciples, one starts with classical field theory and one with quantum field\ntheory. The latter derivation arose previously in the programme of the general\nboundary formulation of quantum theory.

In particular, it leads to a well defined\ntransition between the Newtonian and the modified gravitational regimes, a\ntransition depending on both the Newtonian acceleration and its first\nderivative with respect to radius. Under the hypothesis of the applicability of\nthis transition to aspherical systems, we investigate whether it can reproduce\nobserved galaxy rotation curves. We conclude that the formula leads to\nmarginally acceptable fits with strikingly low best-fit distances, low stellar\nmass-to-light ratios, and a low Hubble constant.

This resonant tide can induce phase shift in the\ngravitational waveforms, and potentially provide a new window of studying NS\ninterior using gravitational waves. Previous works have considered tidal\nexcitations of pure g-modes (due to stable stratification of the star) and pure\ninertial modes (due to Coriolis force), with the rotational effect treated in\nan approximate manner. However, for realistic NSs, the buoyancy and rotational\neffects can be comparable, giving rise to mixed inertial-gravity modes. We\ndevelop a non-perturbative numerical spectral code to compute the frequencies\nand tidal coupling coefficients of these modes. We then calculate the phase\nshift in the gravitational waveform due to each resonance during binary\ninspiral. We adopt polytropic NS models with a parameterized stratification. We\nderive relevant scaling relations and survey how the phase shift depends on\nvarious properties of the NS. We find that for canonical NSs (with mass M =\n1.4M_sun and radius R = 10 km) and modest rotation rates (< 300 Hz), the\ngravitational wave phase shift due to a resonance is generally less than 0.01\nradian.

For typical BH binaries with masses $m_{1,2}\\simeq\n20M_\\odot-30M_\\odot$ and initial semimajor axis $a_0\\sim100$ AU (such that the\nbinaries have no chance of merging by themselves within $\\sim10^{10}$ yrs), we\nshow that binary-binary interactions can significantly increase the LK window\nfor mergers (the range of companion inclinations that allows the BH binary to\nmerge within 10~Gyrs). This increase arises from a secular resonance between\nthe LK oscillation of the BH binary and the nodal precession of the outer\n(binary-binary) orbit driven by the tertiary binary. Therefore, in the presence\nof tertiary binary, the BH merger fraction is increased to $10-30\\%$, an order\nof magnitude larger than the merger fraction found in similar triple systems.\nOur analysis (with appropriate scalings) can be easily adapted to other\nconfigurations of systems, such as relatively compact BH binaries and\nmoderately hierarchical triples, which may generate even higher merger\nfractions.

Previous progress in process\nphysics included the demonstration that space and quantum physics are emergent\nand unified, with time a distinct non-geometric process, that quantum phenomena\nare caused by fractal topological defects embedded in and forming a growing\nthree-dimensional fractal process-space, which is essentially a quantum foam.\nOther features of the emergent physics were: quantum field theory with emergent\nflavour and confined colour, limited causality and the Born quantum measurement\nmetarule, inertia, time-dilation effects, gravity and the equivalence\nprinciple, a growing universe with a cosmological constant, black holes and\nevent horizons, and the emergence of classicality.

As a step\nof the presented machinery, a proof of the almost-everywhere smoothness of the\nLorentzian distance considered as a function of one of the two arguments is\ngiven. Afterwards, using a $C^*$-algebra approach, the spacetime causal\nstructure and the Lorentzian distance are generalized into noncommutative\nstructures giving rise to a Lorentzian version of part of Connes'\nnoncommutative geometry. The generalized noncommutative spacetime consists of a\ndirect set of Hilbert spaces and a related class of $C^*$-algebras of\noperators.

First, we explore how dissipation in the magneto-viscous boundary layer\n(MVBL) at the crust-core interface governs the damping of r-mode perturbations\nin the fluid interior. Two models are considered: one assuming an\nordinary-fluid interior, the other taking the core to consist of superfluid\nneutrons, type II superconducting protons, and normal electrons. We show,\nwithin our approximations, that no solution to the magnetohydrodynamic\nequations exists in the superfluid model when both the neutron and proton\nvortices are pinned. However, if just one species of vortex is pinned, we can\nfind solutions. When the neutron vortices are pinned and the proton vortices\nare unpinned there is much more dissipation than in the ordinary-fluid model,\nunless the pinning is weak. When the proton vortices are pinned and the neutron\nvortices are unpinned the dissipation is comparable or slightly less than that\nfor the ordinary-fluid model, even when the pinning is strong. We also find in\nthe superfluid model that relatively weak radial magnetic fields ~ 10^9 G (10^8\nK / T)^2 greatly affect the MVBL, though the effects of mutual friction tend to\ncounteract the magnetic effects. Second, we evolve our two models in time,\naccounting for accretion, and explore how the magnetic field strength, the\nr-mode saturation amplitude, and the accretion rate affect the cyclic evolution\nof these stars. If the r-modes control the spin cycles of accreting neutron\nstars we find that magnetic fields can affect the clustering of the spin\nfrequencies of low mass x-ray binaries (LMXBs) and the fraction of these that\nare currently emitting gravitational waves. \n\n"}

We stress that we do not\nclaim to have a satisfactory answer to this question, rather our intention is\nto ignite a discussion by displaying the problems that have to be solved when\ncarrying out such a program. In the present paper we propose a scheme that one\nmight follow in order to arrive at such a limit. We discuss the technical and\nconceptual problems that arise in doing so and how they can be solved in\nprinciple. As to be expected, completely new issues arise due to the fact that\nQGR is a background independent theory. For instance, fundamentally the notion\nof a photon involves not only the Maxwell quantum field but also the metric\noperator - in a sense, there is no photon vacuum state but a \"photon vacuum\noperator\"! While in this first paper we focus on conceptual and abstract\naspects, for instance the definition of (fundamental) n-particle states (e.g.\nphotons), in the second paper we perform detailed calculations including, among\nother things, coherent state expectation values and propagation on random\nlattices.

The limit of the near-horizon\napproximation is considered. If the Killing horizon is bifurcate the conformal\nsymmetry is hidden, i.e. it does not arise from geometrical spacetime\nisometries, but the whole Hilbert space turns out to be an irreducible unitary\nrepresentation of SL(2,R) and the time evolution is embodied in the unitary\nrepresentation.

The conditions derived from this principle include a version of the\nLeibniz rule (or ``action Ward identity'') and a condition on time-ordered\nproducts that contain a factor of the free field $\\phi$ or the free\nstress-energy tensor $T_{ab}$.

It is argued, in the spirit of the free\nfall type universality, that the preferred quantum field vacua with respect to\naccelerated worldlines should be chosen in the class of all those possessing\nstationary spectra for their quantum fluctuations. For scalar quantum field\nvacua there are six stationary cases as shown by Letaw some time ago, these are\nreviewed here.

We demonstrate that in general inhomogeneous\nuniverses such a proposal would involve extremely complicated - possibly\nfractal - light sheets. Furthermore, in general such a light sheet cannot be\nknown a priori on the basis of theory and moreover, the evolution of the\nuniverse makes it clear that in general such bounds cannot remain invariant\nunder time reversal and will change with epoch.\n  We propose a modified version of this proposal in which the light sheets end\non the boundary of the past, and hence avoid contact with the caustics. In this\nway the resulting light sheets and projections can be made much simpler. We\ndiscuss the question of operational definability of these sheets within the\ncontext of both proposals and conclude that in both cases the theoretical\nexistence of such sheets must be clearly distinguished from their complexity\nand the difficulty of their construction in practice. This puts into\nperspective the likely practical difficulties one would face in applying the\nholographic principle to the real cosmos. These issues may also be of relevance\nin debates regarding the applications of the holographic principle to other\nsettings such as string theory. \n\n"}

In this work we\nintroduce a natural and compelling fourth assumption: if there is no reason to\nprefer one region of the configuration space over another then they should be\n`weighted' equally. This is the last ingredient necessary to introduce a unique\ninner product in the linear space of wave functions. Thus, a form of the\nprinciple of insufficient reason is implicit in the Hilbert inner product.\nArmed with the inner product we obtain two results. First, we elaborate on an\nearlier proof of the Born probability rule. The implicit appeal to insufficient\nreason shows that quantum probabilities are not more objective than classical\nprobabilities. Previously we had argued that the consistent manipulation of\namplitudes leads to a linear time evolution; our second result is that time\nevolution must also be unitary. The argument is straightforward and hinges on\nthe conservation of entropy. The only subtlety consists of defining the correct\nentropy; it is the array entropy, not von Neumann's.
