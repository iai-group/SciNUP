It\nwas discovered in recent years that string theory on AdS_5xS^5 admits a Lax\nformulation. However, the complete statement of integrability requires not only\nthe existence of a Lax formulation, but also that the resulting integrals of\nmotion are in pairwise involution. This idea is central to the first part of\nthis thesis. Exploiting this integrability we apply algebro-geometric methods\nto string theory on RxS^3 and obtain the general finite-gap solution. The\nconstruction is based on an invariant algebraic curve previously found in the\nAdS_5xS^5 case. However, encoding the dynamics of the solution requires\nspecification of additional marked points. By restricting the symplectic\nstructure of the string to this algebro-geometric data we derive the\naction-angle variables of the system. We then perform a first-principle\nsemiclassical quantisation of string theory on RxS^3 as a toy model for strings\non AdS_5xS^5. The result is exactly what one expects from the dual gauge theory\nperspective, namely the underlying algebraic curve discretises in a natural\nway.

Hence, in contrast to previously studied cases, the boundary value\nof the field breaks the residual SO(2) internal symmetry of the model.\nConsequently, even the unit charge skyrmion has only discrete symmetry and\nconsists of a bound state of two half lumps. A model of long-range\ninter-skyrmion forces is developed wherein a unit skyrmion is pictured as a\nsingle scalar dipole inducing a massless scalar field tangential to the vacuum\nmanifold.

We use the Truncated Conformal Space\nApproach (TCSA), a Hamiltonian method which exploits the conformal structure of\nthe UV fixed point. The theory is regulated in the IR by putting it on a sphere\nof a large finite radius. The QFT Hamiltonian is expressed as a matrix in the\nHilbert space of CFT states. After restricting ourselves to energies below a\ncertain UV cutoff, an approximation to the spectrum is obtained by numerical\ndiagonalization of the resulting finite-dimensional matrix. The cutoff\ndependence of the results can be computed and efficiently reduced via a\nrenormalization procedure. We work out the details of the method for the phi^4\ntheory in d dimensions with d not necessarily integer. A numerical analysis is\nthen performed for the specific case d = 2.5, a value chosen in the range where\nUV divergences are absent. By going from weak to intermediate to strong\ncoupling, we are able to observe the symmetry-preserving, symmetry-breaking,\nand conformal phases of the theory, and perform rough measurements of masses\nand critical exponents.

One is a double spin-chain\nformulation of the spin-chain and the associated new interpretation of the\noperation of Wick contraction. It will be regarded as a skew symmetric pairing\nwhich acts as a projection onto a singlet in the entire SO(4) sector, instead\nof an inner product in the spin-chain Hilbert space. This formalism allows us\nto study a class of three-point functions of operators built upon more general\nspin-chain vacua than the special configuration discussed so far in the\nliterature. Furthermore, this new viewpoint has the signicant advantage over\nthe conventional method: In the usual \"tailoring\" operation, the Wick\ncontraction produces inner products between off-shell Bethe states, which\ncannot be in general converted into simple expressions. In contrast, our\nprocedure directly produces the so-called partial domain wall partition\nfunctions, which can be expressed as determinants. Using this property, we\nderive simple determinantal representation for a broader class of three-point\nfunctions. The second new property uncovered in this work is the non-trivial\nidentity satisfied by the three-point functions with monodromy operators\ninserted. Generically this relation connects three-point functions of different\noperators and can be regarded as a kind of Schwinger-Dyson equation. In\nparticular, this identity reduces in the semiclassical limit to the triviality\nof the product of local monodromies around the vertex operators, which played a\ncrucial role in providing all important global information on the three-point\nfunction in the strong coupling regime.

It has been argued that this is an\nanalogue for quantum processes in the presence of closed timelike curves\n(CTCs). The unusual properties of states of quantum communication networks that\nfulfill the D-CTC condition have been discussed extensively in recent\nliterature. In this work, the D-CTC condition is investigated in the framework\nof quantum field theory in the local, operator-algebraic approach due to Haag\nand Kastler. It is shown that the D-CTC condition cannot be fulfilled in states\nwhich are analytic for the energy, or satisfy the Reeh-Schlieder property, for\na certain class of processes and initial conditions.

Since\nlack of information can be related to entropy, this suggests the possibility of\nassigning an entropy to the null surfaces of a spacetime. We motivate and\nintroduce such an entropy functional for any vector field in terms of a\nfourth-rank divergence free tensor P_{ab}^{cd} with the symmetries of the\ncurvature tensor. Extremising this entropy for all the null surfaces then leads\nto equations for the background metric of the spacetime. When P_{ab}^{cd} is\nconstructed from the metric alone, these equations are identical to Einstein's\nequations with an undetermined cosmological constant (which arises as an\nintegration constant). More generally, if P_{ab}^{cd} is allowed to depend on\nboth metric and curvature in a polynomial form, one recovers the\nLanczos-Lovelock gravity. In all these cases: (a) We only need to extremise the\nentropy associated with the null surfaces; the metric is not a dynamical\nvariable in this approach. (b) The extremal value of the entropy agrees with\nstandard results, when evaluated on-shell for a solution admitting a horizon.\nThe role of full quantum theory of gravity will be to provide the specific form\nof P_{ab}^{cd} which should be used in the entropy functional.

The special case of equal deformation parameters\ngamma_i=gamma corresponds to the N=1 supersymmetric deformation. We compare the\nenergies of semiclassical strings with three large angular momenta to the\n1-loop anomalous dimensions of the corresponding gauge-theory scalar operators\nand find that they match as it was the case in the SU(3) sector of the standard\nAdS/CFT duality.

Here the role of a quantum\nprincipal bundle is played by a Hopf-Galois extension. Smash products of an\nalgebra times a Hopf algebra H are particular instances of these extensions,\nand in these cases we are able to define a differential calculus over their\nassociated vector bundles without requiring the use of a (bicovariant)\ndifferential structure over H. Moreover, if H is coquasitriangular, it coacts\nnaturally on the associated bundle, and the differential structure is\ncovariant.\n  We apply this construction to the case of the finite quotient of the SL_q(2)\nfunction Hopf algebra at a root of unity (q^3=1) as the structure group, and a\nreduced 2-dimensional quantum plane as both the \"base manifold\" and fibre,\ngetting an algebra which generalizes the notion of classical phase space for\nthis quantum space. We also build explicitly a differential complex for this\nphase space algebra, and find that levels 0 and 2 support a (co)representation\nof the quantum symplectic group. On this phase space we define vector fields,\nand with the help of the Sp_q structure we introduce a symplectic form relating\n1-forms to vector fields. This leads naturally to the introduction of Poisson\nbrackets, a necessary step to do \"classical\" mechanics on a quantum space, the\nquantum plane. \n\n"}
