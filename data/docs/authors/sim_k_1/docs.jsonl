Using\nBayesian inference makes it possible to take into account the theoretical\nuncertainties on the nuclear matrix elements in a fully consistent way. First,\nwe analyze the data used to claim the observation of neutrinoless double beta\ndecay in Ge-76, and find strong evidence (according to Jeffrey's scale) for a\npeak in the spectrum and moderate evidence for that the peak is actually close\nto the energy expected for the neutrinoless decay. We also find a significantly\nlarger statistical error than the original analysis, which we include in the\ncomparison with other data. Then, we statistically test the consistency between\nthis claim with that of recent measurements using Xe-136. We find that the two\ndata sets are about 40 to 80 times more probable under the assumption that they\nare inconsistent, depending on the nuclear matrix element uncertainties and the\nprior on the smallest neutrino mass.

The measurement of jet spectra in p-Pb collisions\nprovides an important way to quantify the effects of cold nuclear matter on jet\nproduction, fragmentation and hadronization. This is possible because the hot,\ndense medium produced in Pb-Pb collisions is not expected to form.

The exact evaluation of the background from the underlying event is\nan important ingredient to correct the measured jet spectra.

Neutron information is usually extracted from\ndata on nuclear targets such as deuterium, requiring corrections for nuclear\nbinding and nucleon off-shell effects. These corrections are model dependent\nand have significant uncertainties, especially for large values of the Bjorken\nscaling variable x. The Barely Off-shell Nucleon Structure (BONuS) experiment\nat Jefferson Lab measured the inelastic electron deuteron scattering cross\nsection, tagging spectator protons in coincidence with the scattered electrons.\nThis method reduces nuclear binding uncertainties significantly and has allowed\nfor the first time a (nearly) model independent extraction of the neutron\nstructure function. A novel compact radial time projection chamber was built to\ndetect protons with momentum between 70 and 150 MeV/c. For the extraction of\nthe free neutron structure function $F_{2n}$, spectator protons at backward\nangle and with momenta below 100 MeV/c were selected, ensuring that the\nscattering took place on a nearly free neutron. The scattered electrons were\ndetected with Jefferson Lab's CLAS spectrometer.

Due to the event-by-event fluctuating initial\nconditions from the EPOS2 model, the $D$ meson triangular flow is predicted to\nbe nonzero at $\\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV and $\\sqrt{s}=2.76$ TeV. We study the\ncentrality dependence and quantify the contributions stemming from flow of the\nlight bulk event and the hadronization process. The flow coefficients as\nresponse to the initial eccentricities behave differently for heavy mesons than\nfor light hadrons due to their inertia. Higher-order flow coefficients of heavy\nflavor become important in order to quantify the degree of thermalization. \n\n"}

This paper examines persuasion through a computational\nlens, focusing on what is perhaps the most basic and fundamental model in this\nspace: the celebrated Bayesian persuasion model of Kamenica and Gentzkow. Here\nthere are two players, a sender and a receiver. The receiver must take one of a\nnumber of actions with a-priori unknown payoff, and the sender has access to\nadditional information regarding the payoffs. The sender can commit to\nrevealing a noisy signal regarding the realization of the payoffs of various\nactions, and would like to do so as to maximize her own payoff assuming a\nperfectly rational receiver.\n  We examine the sender's optimization task in three of the most natural input\nmodels for this problem, and essentially pin down its computational complexity\nin each. When the payoff distributions of the different actions are i.i.d. and\ngiven explicitly, we exhibit a polynomial-time (exact) algorithm, and a\n\"simple\" $(1-1/e)$-approximation algorithm. Our optimal scheme for the i.i.d.\nsetting involves an analogy to auction theory, and makes use of Border's\ncharacterization of the space of reduced-forms for single-item auctions. When\naction payoffs are independent but non-identical with marginal distributions\ngiven explicitly, we show that it is #P-hard to compute the optimal expected\nsender utility. Finally, we consider a general (possibly correlated) joint\ndistribution of action payoffs presented by a black box sampling oracle, and\nexhibit a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS) with a bi-criteria\nguarantee. We show that this result is the best possible in the black-box model\nfor information-theoretic reasons. \n\n"}

Applying an external\nmagnetic field of sufficiently high intensity (in the range of 0.5-1 Tesla for\noperating pressures in the range of 5-15 atmospheres) causes the electrons to\nproduce helical tracks. Assuming the tracks can be properly reconstructed, the\nsign (direction) of curvature can be determined at several points along these\ntracks, and such information can be used to separate signal (0nbb) events\ncontaining two electrons producing a track with two different directions of\ncurvature from background (single-electron) events producing a track that\nshould spiral in a single direction.

These global antineutrinos produce detectable\nsignals in large ultra-clear volumes of water- or hydrocarbon-based target\nliquids, which are viewed by inward-facing photomultiplier tubes. Detected\nantineutrinos provide information about their shrouded sources and about the\nfundamental properties of neutrinos themselves.

The model includes estimates of the\nsteady state reaction rates and energy spectra of the antineutrinos from the\ncrust and mantle of the Earth.

The original Peer-prediction mechanism\nsuffers from two main limitations: (1) the mechanism must know the \"common\nprior\" of agents' signals; (2) additional undesirable and non-truthful\nequilibria exist which often have a greater expected payoff than the\ntruth-telling equilibrium. A series of results has successfully weakened the\nknown common prior assumption. However, the equilibrium multiplicity issue\nremains a challenge.\n  In this paper, we address the above two problems. In the setting where a\ncommon prior exists but is not known to the mechanism we show (1) a general\nnegative result applying to a large class of mechanisms showing truth-telling\ncan never pay strictly more in expectation than a particular set of equilibria\nwhere agents collude to \"relabel\" the signals and tell the truth after\nrelabeling signals; (2) provide a mechanism that has no information about the\ncommon prior but where truth-telling pays as much in expectation as any\nrelabeling equilibrium and pays strictly more than any other symmetric\nequilibrium; (3) moreover in our mechanism, if the number of agents is\nsufficiently large, truth-telling pays similarly to any equilibrium close to a\n\"relabeling\" equilibrium and pays strictly more than any equilibrium that is\nnot close to a relabeling equilibrium. \n\n"}

Knowledge of the neutrino energy spectrum and\nneutrino-detector interactions are crucial for these experiments. Short range\nnucleon-nucleon correlations in nuclei (SRC) affect properties of nuclei. The\nArgoNeut liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (lArTPC) observed neutrino-argon\nscattering events with two protons back-to-back in the final state (\"hammer\"\nevents) which they associated with SRC pairs. The MicroBoone lArTPC will\nmeasure far more of these events.\n  We simulate hammer events using two simple models. We use the well-known\nelectron-nucleon cross section to calculate e-argon interactions where the e-\nscatters from a proton, ejecting a pi+, and the pi+ is then absorbed on a\nmoving deuteron-like $np$ pair. We also use a model where the electron excites\na nucleon to a Delta, which then deexcites by interacting with a second\nnucleon.\n  The pion production model results in two protons very similar to those of the\nhammer events. These distributions are insensitive to the momentum of the $np$\npair that absorbed the $\\pi$. The incident neutrino energy can be reconstructed\nfrom just the outgoing lepton. The Delta process results in two protons that\nare less similar to the observed events.\n  ArgoNeut hammer events can be described by a simple pion production and\nreabsorption model.

For the improved\nunderstanding of the process, the rates of the involved nuclear reactions must\nbe known. The reaction 128Ba(g,a)124Xe was found to affect the abundance of the\np nucleus 124Xe. Since the stellar rate for this reaction cannot be determined\nby a measurement directly, the aim of the present work was to measure the cross\nsection of the inverse 124Xe(a,g)128Ba reaction and to compare the results with\nstatistical model predictions. Of great importance is the fact that data below\nthe (a,n) threshold was obtained. Studying simultaneously the 124Xe(a,n)127Ba\nreaction channel at higher energy allowed to further identify the source of a\ndiscrepancy between data and prediction. The 124Xe + alpha cross sections were\nmeasured with the activation method using a thin window 124Xe gas cell. The\nstudied energy range was between E = 11 and 15 MeV close above the\nastrophysically relevant energy range. The obtained cross sections are compared\nwith statistical model calculations. The experimental cross sections are\nsmaller than standard predictions previously used in astrophysical\ncalculations. As dominating source of the difference, the theoretical alpha\nwidth was identified. The experimental data suggest an alpha width lower by at\nleast a factor of 0.125 in the astrophysical energy range. An upper limit for\nthe 128Ba(g,a)124Xe stellar rate was inferred from our measurement. The impact\nof this rate was studied in two different models for core-collapse supernova\nexplosions of 25 solar mass stars.

The strange quark mass is tuned to its\nphysical value and we use two strange to light quark mass ratios $m_s/m_l=20$\nand $27$, which in the continuum limit correspond to a pion mass of about $160$\nMeV and $140$ MeV espectively. Sixth-order results for Taylor expansion\ncoefficients are used to estimate truncation errors of the fourth-order\nexpansion. We show that truncation errors are small for baryon chemical\npotentials less then twice the temperature ($\\mu_B\\le 2T$). The fourth-order\nequation of state thus is suitable for the modeling of dense matter created in\nheavy ion collisions with center-of-mass energies down to $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}\\sim\n12$ GeV. We provide a parametrization of basic thermodynamic quantities that\ncan be readily used in hydrodynamic simulation codes.

Our fairness\nguarantees are in terms of the maximin share, that is defined to be the maximum\nvalue that an agent can ensure for herself, if she were to partition the goods\ninto n bundles, and then receive a minimum valued bundle. Since maximin fair\nallocations (i.e., allocations in which each agent gets at least her maximin\nshare) do not always exist, prior work has focused on approximation results\nthat aim to find allocations in which the value of the bundle allocated to each\nagent is (multiplicatively) as close to her maximin share as possible. In\nparticular, Procaccia and Wang (2014) along with Amanatidis et al.

To explore the currently-unknown territories in the nuclear\nchart far away from the stability, reliable theoretical predictions are\ninevitable.\n  Purpose: To provide a reliable prediction of production cross sections taking\ninto account secondary deexcitation processes, both particle evaporation and\nfission, a new method called TDHF+GEMINI is proposed, which combines the\nmicroscopic time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) theory with a sophisticated\nstatistical compound-nucleus deexcitation model, GEMINI++.\n  Results: The method is applied for multinucleon transfer processes in\nlow-energy heavy ion reactions. It is shown that the inclusion of secondary\ndeexcitation processes, which are dominated by neutron evaporation in the\npresent systems, substantially improves agreement with the experimental data.\nThe magnitude of the evaporation effects is very similar to the one observed in\nGRAZING calculations.

This scale probes the domain within which\nhard valence-quark degrees-of-freedom could be expected to determine form\nfactor behavior. Hence, with this new data the Roper resonance becomes a\nproblem for strong-QCD [sQCD]. An explanation of how and where the Roper\nresonance fits into the emerging spectrum of hadrons cannot rest on a\ndescription of its mass alone. Instead, it must combine this with a detailed\nunderstanding of the Roper's structure and how that is revealed in the\ntransition form factors. Furthermore, it must unify all this with a similarly\ncomplete picture of the proton. This is a prodigious task, but a ten-year\ninternational effort, drawing together experimentalists and theorists, has\npresented a solution to the puzzle.

In doing\nso, a leader-follower- inspired coalition formation algorithm amalgamating the\nthree objectives to address the problem of the computational complexity of\ncoalition formation in large-scale UAV networks is proposed. This algorithm\nattempts to form the coalitions with minimally exceeding the required resources\nfor the encountered tasks while maximizing the number of completed tasks. The\nproposed algorithm is based on Quantum Evolutionary Algorithms(QEA) which are a\ncombination of quantum computing and evolutionary algorithms. Results from\nsimulations show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the\nexisting coalition formation algorithms such as merge-and-split and a famous\nmulti-objective genetic algorithm called NSGA-II. \n\n"}

In both collision systems, the jet fragmentation functions are\nmeasured for jets with transverse momentum between 126 GeV and 398 GeV and with\nan absolute value of jet rapidity less than 2.1. An enhancement of particles\ncarrying a small fraction of the jet momentum is observed, which increases with\ncentrality and with increasing jet transverse momentum. Yields of particles\ncarrying a very large fraction of the jet momentum are also observed to be\nenhanced. Between these two enhancements of the fragmentation functions a\nsuppression of particles carrying an intermediate fraction of the jet momentum\nis observed in Pb+Pb collisions. A small dependence of the modifications on jet\nrapidity is observed. \n\n"}

In\norder for acoustic models to be able to handle large acoustic variability,\nlarge amounts of labeled data is necessary, which are often expensive to\nobtain. This paper explores the application of adversarial training to learn\nfeatures from raw speech that are invariant to acoustic variability. This\nacoustic variability is referred to as a domain shift in this paper. The\nexperimental study presented in this paper leverages the architecture of Domain\nAdversarial Neural Networks (DANNs) [1] which uses data from two different\ndomains. The DANN is a Y-shaped network that consists of a multi-layer CNN\nfeature extractor module that is common to a label (senone) classifier and a\nso-called domain classifier. The utility of DANNs is evaluated on multiple\ndatasets with domain shifts caused due to differences in gender and speaker\naccents. Promising empirical results indicate the strength of adversarial\ntraining for unsupervised domain adaptation in ASR, thereby emphasizing the\nability of DANNs to learn domain invariant features from raw speech. \n\n"}

Even though the measured suppression factors for hadrons and\njets differ significantly from one another and appear to asymptote to different\nvalues in the high energy limit, we obtain a simultaneous description of all\nthese data after constraining the value of a single model parameter. We use our\nmodel to investigate the origin of the difference between the observed\nsuppression of jets and hadrons and relate it, quantitatively, to the observed\nmodification of the jet fragmentation function in jets that have been modified\nby passage through the medium produced in heavy ion collisions. In particular,\nthe observed increase in the fraction of hard fragments in medium-modified\njets, which indicates that jets with the fewest hardest fragments lose the\nleast energy, corresponds quantitatively to the observed difference between the\nsuppression of hadrons and jets. We argue that a harder fragmentation pattern\nfor jets with a given energy after quenching is a generic feature of any\nmechanism for the interaction between jets and the medium that they traverse\nthat yields a larger suppression for wider jets. We also compare the results of\nour global fit to LHC data to measurements of the suppression of high energy\nhadrons in RHIC collisions, and find that with its parameter chosen to fit the\nLHC data our model is inconsistent with the RHIC data at the $3\\sigma$ level,\nsuggesting that hard probes interact more strongly with the less hot\nquark-gluon plasma produced at RHIC. \n\n"}

A WaveNet-based neural vocoder has significantly\nimproved the quality of parametric text-to-speech (TTS) systems. However, it is\nchallenging to effectively train the neural vocoder when the target database\ncontains massive amount of acoustical information such as prosody, style or\nexpressiveness. As a solution, the approaches that only generate the vocal\nsource component by a neural vocoder have been proposed. However, they tend to\ngenerate synthetic noise because the vocal source component is independently\nhandled without considering the entire speech production process; where it is\ninevitable to come up with a mismatch between vocal source and vocal tract\nfilter.

What is the best performance that the gambler can achieve in comparison\nto a prophet who can always choose the highest value? Krengel, Sucheston, and\nGarling solved this problem in 1978, showing that there exists a strategy for\nwhich the gambler can achieve half as much reward as the prophet in\nexpectation.

In the most central Au+Au collisions\nat the highest beam energy, evidence is found for the formation of a very high\nenergy density system whose description in terms of simple hadronic degrees of\nfreedom is inappropriate. Furthermore, the constituents of this novel system\nare found to undergo a significant level of interaction. The properties of\nparticle production at RHIC energies are shown to follow a number of simple\nscaling behaviors, some of which continue trends found at lower energies or in\nsimpler systems. As a function of centrality, the total number of charged\nparticles scales with the number of participating nucleons. When comparing\nAu+Au at different centralities, the dependence of the yield on the number of\nparticipants at higher pT (~4 GeV/c) is very similar to that at low transverse\nmomentum. The measured values of charged particle pseudorapidity density and\nelliptic flow were found to be independent of energy over a broad range of\npseudorapidities when effectively viewed in the rest frame of one of the\ncolliding nuclei, a property we describe as \"extended longitudinal scaling''.\nFinally, the centrality and energy dependences of several observables were\nfound to factorize to a surprising degree. \n\n"}

A notable example is the kaon which plays\nspecial roles in all the three fields. In this paper, we first review the\nvarious theoretical investigations of kaon properties in nuclear medium,\nfocusing on possible uncertainties in each model. We then present a detailed\ntransport model study of kaon production in heavy-ion collisions at SIS\nenergies. We shall discuss especially the elementary kaon and antikaon\nproduction cross sections in hadron-hadron interactions, that represent one of\nthe most serious uncertainties in the transport model study of particle\nproduction in heavy-ion collisions. The main purpose of such a study is to\nconstrain kaon in-medium properties from the heavy-ion data. This can provide\nuseful guidances for the development of theoretical models of the kaon in\nmedium. In the last part of the paper, we apply the kaon in-medium properties\nextracted from heavy-ion data to the study of neutron star properties. Based on\na conventional equation of state of nuclear matter that can be considered as\none of the best constrained by available experimental data on finite nuclei, we\nfind that the maximum mass of neutron stars is about 2$M_\\odot$, which is\nreduced to about 1.5$M_\\odot$ once kaon condensation as constrained by\nheavy-ion data is introduced. \n\n"}

The processes\nconsidered are $\\pi\\pi\\to l{\\bar l}$, $\\pi\\rho\\to l{\\bar l}$, $\\pi a_1\\to\nl{\\bar l}$, $\\pi\\omega\\to l{\\bar l}$, $K{\\bar K}\\to l{\\bar l}$, and $K{\\bar\nK^*}+c.c \\to l{\\bar l}$. The elementary cross sections for those are obtained\nfrom chiral Lagrangians involving pseudoscalar, vector, and axial-vector\nmesons. The respective electromagnetic form factors are determined by fitting\nto experimental data for the reverse processes of $e^+e^-\\to hadrons$. Based on\nthis input we calculate cross sections and thermal dilepton emission rates and\ncompare our results with those from other approaches. Finally we use these\nelementary cross sections with a relativistic transport model and calculate\ndilepton spectra in S+W collisions at SPS energies. The comparison of our\nresults with experimental data from the HELIOS-3 collaboration indicates the\nimportance of the secondary hadronic contributions to the intermediate-mass\ndilepton spectra. \n\n"}

We investigate the\nconsequences of this for the charge-independence breaking (CIB) of the $^1S_0$\nscattering length, $\\Delta a_{CIB}$.
