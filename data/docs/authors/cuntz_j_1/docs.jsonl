This representation\nis obtained through a quantized representation of the Hecke operators. in this\nrepresentation, the Hecke operators act on the Berezin's quantization,\ndeformation algebra of the fundamental domain of $\\PSL(2,\\Z)$ in the upper\nhalfplane.

In particular, given an\nopen interval containing $[-2\\sqrt p, 2\\sqrt p]$, there are at most a finite\nnumber of possible exceptional eigenvalues lying outside this interval.

The conditions\ninclude the existence of non-degenerate anti-homomorphisms from B to M(C) and\nfrom C to M(B), the multiplier algebras of C and B respectively. They are\ncalled the antipodal maps.

The notion is\nmore restrictive than what is generally considered in the case of\n(finite-dimensional) algebras with identity. The separability idempotents we\nconsider in this paper are of a Frobenius type. It seems to be quite natural to\nconsider this type of separability idempotents in the case of non-degenerate\nalgebras possibly without an identity. One example is coming from a discrete\nquantum group A. Here we take B=C=A and E is the image under the coproduct of\nh, where h is the normalized cointegral.

The classification result is geometric in the\nsense that it establishes that any Morita equivalence between $C^*(E)$ and\n$C^*(F)$ in this class can be realized by a sequence of moves leading from $E$\nto $F$, in a way resembling the role of Reidemeister moves on knots. As a key\ningredient, we introduce a new class of such moves, establish that they leave\nthe graph algebras invariant, and prove that after this augmentation, the list\nof moves becomes complete in the sense described above.\n  Along the way, we prove that every ordered, reduced filtered $K$-theory\nisomorphism can be lifted to an isomorphism between the stabilized\n$C^*$-algebras - and, as a consequence, that every ordered, reduced filtered\n$K$-theory isomorphism preserving the class of the unit comes from a\n$*$-isomorphism between the unital graph $C^*$-algebras themselves.\n  It follows that the question of Morita equivalence amongst unital graph\n$C^*$-algebras is a decidable one.

In particular, this\nconcerns the theory when restricted to the case where all the semi-strongly\nself-absorbing actions are assumed to be unitarily regular, which is a mild\ntechnical condition. The central result in the first part is a strengthened\nversion of the equivariant McDuff-type theorem, where equivariant tensorial\nabsorption can be achieved with respect to so-called very strong cocycle\nconjugacy.\n  Secondly, we establish completely new results within the theory.

In particular,\nwe consider the case where spectrum conditions are required for the\nimplementing unitary group in covariant representations of such actions. The\nexistence of a crossed product construction is guaranteed by the existence of\n\"cross representations\". For one-parameter automorphism groups, we prove that\nthe existence of cross representations is stable with respect to a large set of\nperturbations of the action, and we fully analyze the structure of cross\nrepresentations of inner actions on von Neumann algebras. For one-parameter\nautomorphism groups we study the cross property for covariant representations,\nwhere the generator of the implementing unitary group is positive.

KMS states correspond to\npositive eigenvectors of s. A Perron-Frobenius type theorem asserts the\nexistence of KMS states at inverse temperatures equal the logarithms of the\ninner and outer spectral radii of s (extremal KMS states). Examples arising\nfrom subshifts in symbolic dynamics, self-similar sets in fractal geometry and\nnoncommutative metric spaces are discussed.\n  Certain subshifts are naturally associated to the system and the relationship\nbetween their topological entropy and inverse temperatures of extremal KMS\nstates are given.\n  Noncommutative shift maps are considered.
