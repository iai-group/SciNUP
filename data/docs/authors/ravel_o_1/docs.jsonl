Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days.

Some theoretical\nestimates for the cores of relaxed clusters predict an excess of helium\nabundance by up to a factor of a few over its primordial value. The\nintracluster helium abundance cannot be measured directly. This presents a\nsignificant source of uncertainty for cosmological tests based on the X-ray\nderived cluster quantities, such as the gas mass, total mass, and gas mass\nfraction, all of which depend on the assumed helium abundance.

Despite the relatively\nlarge mass ratios, the host disks are not fully destroyed by the infalling\nsatellites: a remaining kinematically cold and thin component containing\n~15-25% of the mass can be identified, which is embedded in a hotter and\nthicker disk.

Using a Monte Carlo process to include effects\nof pulsar geometry, we obtain average injection spectra (with relatively small\nerrors) of particles leaving the MSPs. These spectra are next used to predict\ncumulative synchrotron and IC spectra expected from 47 Tucanae, which is a\nlower limit, as no reacceleration is assumed. We find that the IC radiation\nfrom 47 Tucanae may be visible for H.E.S.S., depending on the nebular field B\nas well as the number of MSPs N in the GC. Telescopes such as Chandra and\nHubble may find it difficult to test the SR component prediction of diffuse\nradiation if there are many unresolved sources in the field of view. These\nresults may be rescaled for other GCs where less information is available,\nassuming universal GC MSP characteristics. \n\n"}

The measurement of an exo-planet's orbit by\ndirect imaging is complicated by a number of factors: (1) the inner working\nangle (IWA); (2) the apparent brightness of the planet depending on the orbital\nphase; (3) confusion arising from the presence of multiple planets; and (4) the\nplanet-star contrast.

We find CIV\nsystems at similar redshifts in paired sightlines more often than expected for\nsightline-independent redshifts. As the separation of the sightlines increases\nfrom 36 kpc to 907 kpc, the amplitude of this clustering decreases. At the\nlargest separations, the CIV systems cluster similar to Lyman-break galaxies\n(Adelberger et al. 2005a). The CIV systems are significantly less correlated\nthan these galaxies, however, at separations less than R_1 ~ 0.42 +/- 0.15 h-1\ncomoving Mpc. Measured in real space, i.e., transverse to the sightlines, this\nlength scale is significantly smaller than the break scale estimated from the\nline-of-sight correlation function in redshift space (Scannapieco et al.\n2006a). Using a simple model, we interpret the new real-space measurement as an\nindication of the typical physical size of enriched regions. We adopt this size\nfor enriched regions and fit the redshift-space distortion in the line-of-sight\ncorrelation function. The fitted velocity kick is consistent with the peculiar\nvelocity of galaxies as determined by the underlying mass distribution and\nplaces an upper limit on the outflow (or inflow) speed of metals. The implied\ntime scale for dispersing metals is larger than the typical stellar ages of\nLyman-break galaxies (Shapley et al. 2001), and we argue that enrichment by\ngalaxies at z > 4.3 played a greater role in dispersing metals. To further\nconstrain the growth of enriched regions, we discuss empirical constraints on\nthe evolution of the CIV correlation function with cosmic time. This study\ndemonstrates the potential of tomography for measuring the metal enrichment\nhistory of the circum-galactic medium. \n\n"}

Our formulation --- the `endpoint\nformulation' --- combines numerous results developed in the literature in\nrelation to radiation arising from particle acceleration using a complete, and\ncompletely general, treatment. We do this by describing particle motion via a\nseries of discrete, instantaneous acceleration events, or `endpoints', with\neach such event being treated as a source of emission. This method implicitly\nallows for particle creation/destruction, and is suited to direct numerical\nimplementation in either the time- or frequency-domains.

Calvera was observed in the X-rays with XMM/EPIC\ntwice for a total exposure time of ~50 ks.

The detection is highly significant (> 11 sigma), and\nunambiguously confirms the neutron star nature of Calvera. The pulse profile is\nnearly sinusoidal, with a pulsed fraction of ~18%.

The diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) mechanism is usually\ninvoked to explain this acceleration, but the way in which electrons are\ninitially energized or 'injected' into this acceleration process starting from\nthermal energies is an unresolved problem. In this paper we study the initial\nacceleration of electrons in non-relativistic shocks from first principles,\nusing two- and three-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) plasma simulations. We\nsystematically explore the space of shock parameters (the Alfv\\'enic Mach\nnumber, M_A, the shock velocity, v_{sh}, the angle between the upstream\nmagnetic field and the shock normal, theta_{Bn}, and the ion to electron mass\nratio, m_i/m_e). We find that significant non-thermal acceleration occurs due\nto the growth of oblique whistler waves in the foot of quasi-perpendicular\nshocks. The obtained electron energy distributions show power law tails with\nspectral indices up to alpha ~ 3-4. The maximum energies of the accelerated\nparticles are consistent with the electron Larmor radii being comparable to\nthat of the ions, indicating potential injection into the subsequent DSA\nprocess. This injection mechanism, however, requires the shock waves to have\nfairly low Alf\\'enic Mach numbers, M_A <~ 20, which is consistent with the\ntheoretical conditions for the growth of whistler waves in the shock foot (M_A\n<~ (m_i/m_e)^{1/2}). Thus, if the whistler mechanism is the only robust\nelectron injection process at work in SNR shocks, then SNRs that display\nnon-thermal emission must have significantly amplified upstream magnetic\nfields. Such field amplification is likely achieved by the escaping cosmic\nrays, so electron and proton acceleration in SNR shocks must be interconnected. \n\n"}

An\nanisotropic momentum distribution of the ejecta is built up only after the\nexplosion sets in.

Model and analysis Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is commonly considered as a mechanism of solar\n(eruptive) flares. A deeper study of this scenario reveals, however, a number\nof open issues. Among them is the fundamental question, how the magnetic energy\nis transferred from large, accumulation scales to plasma scales where its\nactual dissipation takes place. In order to investigate this transfer over a\nbroad range of scales we address this question by means of a high-resolution\nMHD simulation. The simulation results indicate that the magnetic-energy\ntransfer to small scales is realized via a cascade of consecutive smaller and\nsmaller flux-ropes (plasmoids), in analogy with the vortex-tube cascade in\n(incompressible) fluid dynamics. Both tearing and (driven) \"fragmenting\ncoalescence\" processes are equally important for the consecutive fragmentation\nof the magnetic field (and associated current density) to smaller elements. At\nthe later stages a dynamic balance between tearing and coalescence processes\nreveals a steady (power-law) scaling typical for cascading processes. It is\nshown that cascading reconnection also addresses other open issues in solar\nflare research such as the duality between the regular large-scale picture of\n(eruptive) flares and the observed signatures of fragmented (chaotic) energy\nrelease, as well as the huge number of accelerated particles. Indeed,\nspontaneous current-layer fragmentation and formation of multiple channelised\ndissipative/acceleration regions embedded in the current layer appears to be\nintrinsic to the cascading process. The multiple small-scale current sheets may\nalso facilitate the acceleration of a large number of particles. The structure,\ndistribution and dynamics of the embedded potential acceleration regions in a\ncurrent layer fragmented by cascading reconnection are studied and discussed. \n\n"}

These activity signatures are interpreted as being\ncaused by coupling of an ionised atmosphere to the stellar magnetic field. What\nremains a puzzle, however, is the mechanism by which such a cool atmosphere can\nproduce the necessary level of ionisation. At these low temperatures, thermal\ngas processes are insufficient, but the formation of clouds sets in. Cloud\nparticles can act as seeds for electron avalanches in streamers that ionise the\nambient gas, and can lead to lightning and indirectly to magnetic field\ncoupling, a combination of processes also expected for protoplanetary disks.\nHowever, the precondition is that the cloud particles are charged.\n  We use results from Drift-Phoenix model atmospheres to investigate\ncollisional processes. We show that ionisation by turbulence-induced dust-dust\ncollisions is the most efficient kinetic process. Dust-dust collisions alone\nare not sufficient to improve the magnetic coupling of the atmosphere inside\nthe cloud layers, but the charges supplied either on grains or within the gas\nphase as separated electrons can trigger secondary non-linear processes.

We propose a simple prescription to infer the angular\nbispectrum from the power spectrum of point sources considering independent\npopulations of sources, with or without clustering. We test the accuracy of our\nprediction using publicly available all-sky simulations of radio and IR sources\nand find very good agreement.

We show\nthat the IR angular bispectrum peaks for squeezed triangles and that the\nclustering of IR sources enhances the bispectrum values by several orders of\nmagnitude at scales l \\sim 100. At 150 GHz the bispectrum of IR sources starts\nto dominate that of radio sources on large angular scales, and it dominates\nover the whole multipole range at 350 GHz.

The showers are either induced by\ngamma rays or diffuse cosmic ray background.

However a major uncertainty is the estimate of the orbital\ninclination angle of an X-ray binary. Here we suggest to measure the black hole\nmass in an X-ray binary by measuring directly the black hole's orbital motion,\nthus obtaining the companion to black hole mass ratio. In this method we assume\nthat accretion disk wind moves with the black hole and thus the black hole's\norbital motion can be obtained from the Doppler velocity of the absorption\nlines produced in the accretion disk wind. We validate this method by analyzing\nthe Chandra/HETG observations of GRO J1655-40, in which the black hole orbital\nmotion with line of sight velocity of 90.8 (+-11.3) km/s, inferred from the\nDoppler velocity of disk-wind absorption lines, is consistent with the\nprediction from its previously measured system parameters. We obtain the black\nhole mass of 5.41 (+0.98, -0.57) solar masses and system inclination of 72.0\n(+7.8, -7.5) degrees in GRO J1655-40. Additional observations of this source\ncovering more orbital phases can improve estimates on its system parameters\nsubstantially. We then apply the method to the black hole X-ray binary LMC X-3\nobserved with HST/COS near orbital phase 0.75. We find that the disk-wind\nabsorption lines of CIV doublet were shifted to about 50 km/s, which yields a\ncompanion-to-black-hole mass ratio of 0.6 for an assumed disk wind velocity of\n-400 km/s. Additional observations covering other orbital phases (0.25 in\nparticular) are crucial to ease this assumption and then to directly constrain\nthe mass ratio.

We first present a revised analytic\ncalculation of the neutrino flux, which predicts a flux an order of magnitude\nlower than that obtained by the IceCube collaboration. For benchmark model\nparameters (e.g. the bulk Lorentz factor is \\Gamma=10^{2.5}, the observed\nvariability time for long GRBs is t_v=0.01 s and the ratio between the energy\nin accelerated protons and in radiation is \\eta_p=10 for every burst) in the\nstandard internal shock scenario, the predicted neutrino flux from 215 bursts\nduring the period of the 40-string and 59-string configurations is found to be\na factor of ~3 below the IceCube sensitivity. However, if we accept the\nrecently found inherent relation between the bulk Lorentz factor and burst\nenergy, the expected neutrino flux increases significantly and the spectral\npeak shifts to lower energy. In this case, the non-detection then implies that\nthe baryon loading ratio should be \\eta_p<10 if the variability time of long\nGRBs is fixed to t_v=0.01 s.

In contrast to previous methods that clean\ntrends from light curves before searching for transits, this framework assesses\nthe significance of individual transits simultaneously while modeling\nvariability, systematics, and the photometric quality of individual nights. Our\nMethod for Including Starspots and Systematics in the Marginalized Probability\nof a Lone Eclipse (MISS MarPLE) uses a computationally efficient semi-Bayesian\napproach to explore the vast probability space spanned by the many parameters\nof this model, naturally incorporating the uncertainties in these parameters\ninto its evaluation of candidate events. We show how to combine individual\ntransits processed by MISS MarPLE into periodic transiting planet candidates\nand compare our results to the popular Box-fitting Least Squares (BLS) method\nwith simulations. By applying MISS MarPLE to observations from the MEarth\nProject, we demonstrate the utility of this framework for robustly assessing\nthe false alarm probability of transit signals in real data.

With an orbital\nperiod of 0.19856 days, this system has one of the shortest known periods for\nan M dwarf binary system. Medium-resolution spectroscopy and multi-band\nphotometry for the system are presented. Markov chain Monte Carlo modeling of\nthe light curves and radial velocities yields estimated masses for the stars of\nM1 = 0.54 +/- 0.07 Msun and M2 = 0.34 +/- 0.04 Msun, and radii of R1 = 0.68 +/-\n0.03 Rsun and R2 = 0.58 +/- 0.03 Rsun respectively. This solution places both\ncomponents above the critical Roche overfill limit, providing strong evidence\nthat SDSS J001641-000925 is the first verified M-dwarf contact binary system.\nWithin the follow-up spectroscopy we find signatures of non-solid body rotation\nvelocities, which we interpret as evidence for mass transfer or loss within the\nsystem. In addition, our photometry samples the system over 9 years, and we\nfind strong evidence for period decay at the rate of dP/dt ~8 s/yr. Both of\nthese signatures raise the intriguing possibility that the system is in\nover-contact, and actively losing angular momentum, likely through mass loss.\nThis places SDSS J001641-000925 as not just the first M-dwarf over-contact\nbinary, but one of the few systems of any spectral type known to be actively\nundergoing coalescence. Further study SDSS J001641-000925 is on-going to verify\nthe nature of the system, which may prove to be a unique astrophysical\nlaboratory. \n\n"}

The gas in\nthese galaxies is not in perfect hydrostatic equilibrium. Supernova feedback,\nstellar winds, or active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback can significantly\nperturb the interstellar medium (ISM). Using hydrodynamical simulations, we\ninvestigate the effect of subsonic turbulence in the hot ISM on the ram\npressure stripping process in early-type galaxies. We find that galaxies with\nmore turbulent ISM produce longer, wider, and more smoothly distributed tails\nof the stripped ISM than those characterised by weaker ISM turbulence. Our main\nconclusion is that even very weak internal turbulence, at the level of <15% of\nthe average ISM sound speed, can significantly accelerate the gas removal from\ngalaxies via ram pressure stripping. The magnitude of this effect increases\nsharply with the strength of turbulence. As most of the gas stripping takes\nplace near the boundary between the ISM and the intraclustermedium (ICM), the\nboost in the ISM stripping rate is due to the \"random walk\" of the ISM from the\ncentral regions of the galactic potential well to larger distances, where the\nram pressure is able to permanently remove the gas from galaxies. The ICM can\nbe temporarily trapped inside the galactic potential well due to the mixing of\nthe turbulent ISM with the ICM. The galaxies with more turbulent ISM, yet still\ncharacterised by very weak turbulence, can hold larger amounts of the ICM.\n[Abridged] \n\n"}

We set out a\nprocedure for doing QPO searches in the far more numerous, short, less\nenergetic magnetar bursts.

We use\nempirical models to make inferences about the potential signature of periodic\nand quasi-periodic oscillations at these frequencies.

It will soon become possible to directly link the most accurate\nradio reference frame with the Gaia optical reference frame using many common\nextragalactic objects. It is important to know the level of coincidence between\nthe radio and optical positions of compact active galactic nuclei (AGN). Aims.\nUsing the best catalogues available at present, we investigate how many AGN\nwith significantly large optical-radio positional offsets exist as well as the\npossible causes of these offsets. Methods. We performed a case study by finding\noptical counterparts to the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF2)\nradio sources in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 9 (DR9). The\nICRF2 catalogue was used as a reference because the radio positions determined\nby Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations are about two orders\nof magnitude more accurate than the optical positions. Results. We find 1297\nobjects in common for ICRF2 and SDSS DR9. Statistical analysis of the\noptical-radio differences verifies that the SDSS DR9 positions are accurate to\n~55 mas in both coordinates, with no systematic offset with respect to ICRF2.\nWe find 51 sources (~4% of the sample) for which the positional offset exceeds\n170 mas (~3{\\sigma}). Astrophysical explanations must exist for most of these\noutliers. There are 3 known strong gravitational lenses among them. Dual AGN or\nrecoiling supermassive black holes may also be possible. Conclusions. The most\naccurate Gaia-VLBI reference frame link will require a careful selection of a\ncommon set of objects by eliminating the outliers. On the other hand, the\nsignificant optical-radio positional non-coincidences may offer a new tool for\nfinding e.g. gravitational lenses or dual AGN candidates. Detailed follow-up\nradio interferometric and optical spectroscopic observations are encouraged to\ninvestigate the outlier sources found in this study. \n\n"}

The detector geometry and\nrequired density of instrumentation are discussed along with the requirements\nto control the various sources of background, such as solar neutrinos. In\nparticular, the suppression of spallation events induced by atmospheric muons\nposes a challenge that will need to be addressed.

More recently, it has been shown that\nthis signal is not confined to the innermost hundreds of parsecs of the Galaxy,\nbut instead extends to at least ~3 kpc from the Galactic Center. While the\nspectrum, intensity, and angular distribution of this signal is in good\nagreement with predictions from annihilating dark matter, it has also been\nsuggested that a population of unresolved millisecond pulsars could be\nresponsible for this excess GeV emission from the Inner Galaxy. In this paper,\nwe consider this later possibility in detail. Comparing the observed spectral\nshape of the Inner Galaxy's GeV excess to the spectrum measured from 37\nmillisecond pulsars by Fermi, we find that these sources exhibit a spectral\nshape that is much too soft at sub-GeV energies to accommodate this signal. We\nalso construct population models to describe the spatial distribution and\nluminosity function of the Milky Way's millisecond pulsars. After taking into\naccount constraints from the observed distribution of Fermi sources (including\nboth sources known to be millisecond pulsars, and unidentified sources which\ncould be pulsars), we find that millisecond pulsars can account for no more\nthan ~10% of the Inner Galaxy's GeV excess.

Not\nmuch is known about the progenitors of these bursts, but they are\nhighly-energetic, and probably of extragalactic origin. Their properties\nsuggest extreme environments and interesting physics, but in order to\nunderstand and study these events, more examples need to be found. Fortunately,\nthe recent boom in radio astronomy means many 'next-generation' radio\ntelescopes are set to begin observing in the near future.

This effect is larger for\nlow-frequency telescopes, where propagation effects are more prominent, but,\ntheir larger fields-of-view are often enough to compensate for this.

Radio timing\nindicates that the pulsar has a circular orbit with a 15 hr orbital period, a\nlow-mass companion, and a measurable orbital period derivative. The eclipse\nfraction of ~15% during the pulsar's orbit is twice the Roche lobe size\ninferred for the companion. The timing behavior is significantly affected by\nunmodeled systematics of astrophysical origin, and higher-order orbital period\nderivatives are needed in the timing solution to account for these variations.\nWe have identified the pulsar's (non-degenerate) companion using archival\nultraviolet, optical, and infrared survey data and new optical photometry.\nDoppler shifts from optical spectroscopy confirm the star's association with\nthe pulsar and indicate a pulsar-to-companion mass ratio of 3.3 +/- 0.5,\ncorresponding to a companion mass range of 0.4 to 0.7 Msun and an orbital\ninclination angle range of between 30 and 41 degrees, assuming a pulsar mass\nrange of 1.4-2.0 Msun.

The galaxy images are reconstructed using the PCA basis\nand subtracted from the data. We then filter the residual image with two\ndifferent methods. The first uses a curvelet (curved wavelets) filter of the\nresidual images to enhance any curved/ring feature. The resulting image is\ntransformed in polar coordinates, centered on the lens galaxy center. In these\ncoordinates, a ring is turned into a line, allowing us to detect very faint\nrings by taking advantage of the integrated signal-to-noise in the ring (a line\nin polar coordinates). The second way of analysing the PCA-subtracted images\nidentifies structures in the residual images and assesses whether they are\nlensed images according to their orientation, multiplicity and elongation. We\napply the two methods to a sample of simulated Einstein rings, as they would be\nobserved with the ESA Euclid satellite in the VIS band.

Using a large number of accurate\nnumerical-relativity simulations of binaries with nuclear equations of state,\nwe find that the postmerger emission is characterized by two distinct and\nrobust spectral features. While the high-frequency peak has already been\nassociated with the oscillations of the hypermassive neutron star produced by\nthe merger and depends on the equation of state, a new correlation emerges\nbetween the low-frequency peak, related to the merger process, and the total\ncompactness of the stars in the binary.

The most of radio-loud pulsars are detected by Fermi LAT\nby using the radio timing models, while the radio-quiet ones are discovered in\na blind search.

We produce a gamma-ray selected catalog of 25 non-recycled gamma-ray\npulsars found in a blind search, including 16 radio-quiet and 9 radio-loud\npulsars.

We calculate the\ndramatic enhancement to the gamma ray flux from the Galactic center (GC) from\nsuch a spike if the 1-3 GeV excess observed in Fermi data is due to DM\nannihilations. We find that for the parameter values favored in recent fits,\nthe point source-like flux from the spike is 35 times greater than the flux\nfrom the inner $1^\\circ$ of the halo, far exceeding all Fermi point source\ndetections near the GC.

Based on N-body simulations,\nwe investigate the morphological and kinematical evolution of the stellar\ncomponent of disks when galaxies undergo fly-by interactions with adjacent dark\nmatter halos. We find that the so-called `S'-shaped warps can be excited by\nfly-bys and sustained for even up to a few billion years, and that this\nscenario provides a cohesive explanation for several key observations. We show\nthat disk warp properties are governed primarily by the following three\nparameters; (1) the impact parameter, i.e., the minimum distance between two\nhalos, (2) the mass ratio between two halos, and (3) the incident angle of the\nfly-by perturber.

For a variety of functional forms\nfor the tracer and DM density profiles, as well as the orbital anisotropy\nprofile, we examine reliability of estimates for the astrophysical J- and\nD-factors for annihilation and decay, respectively. For large (N > 1000)\nstellar-kinematic samples typical of 'classical' dSphs, errors tend to be\ndominated by systematics, which can be reduced through the use of sufficiently\ngeneral and flexible functional forms.

Abstract: In this paper it is shown that the Blazhko effect may result from a\nnear-resonant type of multi-mode pulsation, where two (or sometimes more)\nperiodic oscillations with slightly different frequencies gradually slip in\nphase, producing a beat frequency type of modulation. Typically one of these\noscillations is strongly non-sinusoidal. Two oscillations are sufficient for\nthe standard Blazhko effect; additional oscillations are needed to explain\nmulti-frequency modulation. Previous work on this hypothesis by Arthur N. Cox\nand others is extended in this paper by developing a simple (non-hydro) model\nthat can accurately reproduce several important features found in Kepler data\nfor RR Lyr, including the pulsation waveform, the upper and lower Blazhko\nenvelope functions and the motion, disappearance and reappearance of the bump\nfeature. The non-sinusoidal oscillation is probably generated by the\nfundamental mode and the other oscillations are probably generated by nonradial\nmodes. This model provides an explanation for the strong asymmetry observed in\nthe side peak spectra of most RR Lyrae stars. The motion and disappearance of\nthe bump feature are shown to be an illusion, just an artifact of combining the\noscillations. V445 Lyr is presented as an example with dual modulation.

The instrumental dead time per\nevent is relatively long (~2.5 msec), and varies by a few percent\nevent-to-event. The most obvious effect is a distortion of the white noise\nlevel in the power density spectrum (PDS) that cannot be modeled easily with\nthe standard techniques due to the variable nature of the dead time. In this\npaper, we show that it is possible to exploit the presence of two completely\nindependent focal planes and use the cross power density spectrum to obtain a\ngood proxy of the white noise-subtracted PDS. Thereafter, one can use a Monte\nCarlo approach to estimate the remaining effects of dead time, namely a\nfrequency-dependent modulation of the variance and a frequency-independent drop\nof the sensitivity to variability.

Firehose-Mediated Fermi Acceleration and its Dependence on\n  Pre-Shock Conditions Abstract: Electron acceleration to non-thermal energies is known to occur in low Mach\nnumber (M<5) shocks in galaxy clusters and solar flares, but the electron\nacceleration mechanism remains poorly understood. Using two-dimensional (2D)\nparticle-in-cell (PIC) plasma simulations, we showed in Paper I that electrons\nare efficiently accelerated in low Mach number (M=3) quasi-perpendicular shocks\nvia a Fermi-like process. The electrons bounce between the upstream region and\nthe shock front, with each reflection at the shock resulting in energy gain via\nshock drift acceleration. The upstream scattering is provided by oblique\nmagnetic waves, that are self-generated by the electrons escaping ahead of the\nshock. In the present work, we employ additional 2D PIC simulations to address\nthe nature of the upstream oblique waves. We find that the waves are generated\nby the shock-reflected electrons via the firehose instability, which is driven\nby an anisotropy in the electron velocity distribution. We systematically\nexplore how the efficiency of wave generation and of electron acceleration\ndepend on the magnetic field obliquity, the flow magnetization (or\nequivalently, the plasma beta), and the upstream electron temperature.

One of the most important pieces\nof information comes from the chemical composition of primary particles. It is\nwell known that the muon content of air showers generated by the interaction of\ncosmic rays with the atmosphere is rather sensitive to primary mass. Therefore,\nthe measurement of the number of muons at ground level is an essential\ningredient to infer the cosmic ray mass composition. In this work we present a\nnew method for reconstructing the muon lateral distribution function with an\narray of segmented counters. The energy range from .4 to 2.5 EeV is considered.\nFor a triangular array spaced at 750 m we found that 450 m is the optimal\ndistance to evaluate the number of muons. The corresponding statistical and\nsystematic uncertainties of the new and of a previous reconstruction methods\nare compared. Since the statistical uncertainty of the new reconstruction is\nless than in the original one, the power to discriminate between heavy and\nlight cosmic ray primaries is enhanced.

By the order effect we\nmean a dependence of probability distributions (of measurement results) on the\norder of measurements. We consider two types of the sequential reproducibility:\nadjacent reproducibility ($A-A$) and separated reproducibility($A-B-A$). The\nfirst one is reproducibility with probability 1 of a result of measurement of\nsome observable $A$ measured twice, one $A$ measurement after the other. The\nsecond one, $A-B-A$, is reproducibility with probability 1 of a result of $A$\nmeasurement when another quantum observable $B$ is measured between two $A$'s.\nHeuristically, it is clear that the second type of reproducibility is\ncomplementary to the order effect. We show that, surprisingly, for an important\nclass of quantum observables given by positive operator valued measures\n(POVMs), this may not be the case.

A signal can\nfurther be classified as Gaussian-stochastic if a Gaussian signal model is\nfavored. In our analysis we use Bayesian model selection to choose between\nseveral signal and noise models for simulated data consisting of uncorrelated\nGaussian detector noise plus a superposition of sinusoidal signals from an\nastrophysical population of gravitational-wave sources.

Wind models in which parameters do not explicitly depend on the\naccretion rate cannot reproduce the spin measurements.

However,\nsince the information content of a data set is usually estimated with the\nFisher matrix, priors are added in order to enforce an approximately Gaussian\nlikelihood.

In this article, we construct quasi-equilibrium\nconfigurations for different spins, eccentricities, mass ratios, compactnesses,\nand equations of state.

While the emission from internal shocks has been extensively\nstudied, that from reconnection still has few quantitative predictions. We\nstudy the expected prompt-GRB emission from magnetic reconnection and compare\nits temporal and spectral properties to observations. The main difference from\ninternal shocks is that for reconnection one expects relativistic bulk motions\nwith Lorentz factors $\\Gamma'\\gtrsim\\;$a few in the jet's bulk frame. We\nconsider such motions of the emitting material in two anti-parallel directions\n(e.g. of the reconnecting magnetic-field lines) within an ultra-relativistic\n(with $\\Gamma\\gg1$) thin spherical reconnection layer. The emission's\nrelativistic beaming in the jet's frame greatly affects the light-curves.

Since activity is driven by the sublimation of volatiles, this\nis a puzzling result because this area is less exposed to the Sun and is\ntherefore expected to be cooler on average (Sierks et al. 2015).\n  We used a thermophysical model that takes into account thermal inertia,\nglobal self-heating, and shadowing, to compute surface temperatures of the\ncomet.

Neutron star mergers (NSMs) are suggested to\nbe a major r-process site from nucleosynthesis studies. Previous chemical\nevolution studies however require unlikely short merger time of NSMs to\nreproduce the observed large star-to-star scatters in the abundance ratios of\nr-process elements relative to iron, [Eu/Fe], of extremely metal-poor stars in\nthe Milky Way (MW) halo. This problem can be solved by considering chemical\nevolution in dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) which would be building blocks\nof the MW and have lower star formation efficiencies than the MW halo. We\ndemonstrate that enrichment of r-process elements in dSphs by NSMs using an\nN-body/smoothed particle hydrodynamics code. Our high-resolution model\nreproduces the observed [Eu/Fe] by NSMs with a merger time of 100 Myr when the\neffect of metal mixing is taken into account. This is because metallicity is\nnot correlated with time up to ~ 300 Myr from the start of the simulation due\nto low star formation efficiency in dSphs.

Removal of\nfrequency-dependent interstellar medium (ISM) delays due to dispersion and\nscattering is a key issue in the detection process. Current timing algorithms\nroutinely correct pulse times of arrival (TOAs) for time-variable delays due to\ncold plasma dispersion. However, none of the major pulsar timing groups correct\nfor delays due to scattering from multi-path propagation in the ISM. Scattering\nintroduces a frequency-dependent phase change in the signal that results in\npulse broadening and arrival time delays. Any method to correct the TOA for\ninterstellar propagation effects must be based on multi-frequency measurements\nthat can effectively separate dispersion and scattering delay terms from\nfrequency-independent perturbations such as those due to a gravitational wave.\nCyclic spectroscopy, first described in an astronomical context by Demorest\n(2011), is a potentially powerful tool to assist in this multi-frequency\ndecomposition. As a step toward a more comprehensive ISM propagation delay\ncorrection, we demonstrate through a simulation that we can accurately recover\nimpulse response functions (IRFs), such as those that would be introduced by\nmulti-path scattering, with a realistic signal-to-noise ratio.

The pulsar is thought to switch between an \"off\" state in which no\nemission is detectable, a weak state and a strong state.

I show that under reasonable assumptions\nthe outflow that is expected during the formation of a magnetar can carry an\namount of energy that does not fall much below, and even surpasses, the energy\nthat is stored in the newly born spinning neutron star (NS). The rapidly\nspinning NS and the strong magnetic fields attributed to magnetars require that\nthe accreted mass onto the newly born NS possesses high specific angular\nmomentum and strong magnetic fields. These ingredients are expected, as in many\nother astrophysical objects, to form collimated outflows/jets.

In reality, the\nprocess must be ubiquitous as astrophysical fluids are magnetized and motions\nof fluid elements necessarily entail crossing of magnetic frozen-in field lines\nand magnetic reconnection. In the presence of turbulence, the reconnection is\nindependent of microscopic plasma properties, and may be much faster than\npreviously thought, as proposed in Lazarian & Vishniac (1999) and tested in\nKowal et al.

In this work we consider\nreconnection-driven magnetized turbulence in realistic three-dimensional\ngeometry initiated by stochastic noise. We demonstrate through numerical\nsimulations that the stochastic reconnection is able to self-generate\nturbulence through interactions between its outflows. We analyze the\nstatistical properties of velocity fluctuations using power spectra and\nanisotropy scaling, which demonstrates that the reconnection produces\nKolmogorov-like turbulence, compatible with Goldreich-Sridhar (1995) model.\nAnisotropy statistics are, however, strongly affected by the dynamics of\nreconnection outflows.

The dispersion relation for propagation of small perturbations is found\nin the post-Newtonian approximation using two different techniques.

Such variation renders a critical assumption behind\nthe traditional procedure of flat fielding--that a sensor's pixels comprise a\nuniform grid--invalid. In this work, we present a method to infer a curl-free\nmodel of a sensor's underlying pixel grid from flat field images, incorporating\nthe superposition of all electrostatic sensor effects--both known and\nunknown--present in flat field data.

However, even for such\nmaximum-redundancy arrays, significant sensitivity comes through partial\ncoherence between baselines.

Because Sgr A* varies on timescales short compared to an EHT observing\ncampaign, it is interesting to ask whether variability contains information\nabout the structure and dynamics of the accretion flow. In this paper, we\nintroduce \"time-domain filtering\", a technique to filter time fluctuating\nimages with specific temporal frequency ranges, and demonstrate the power and\nusage of the technique by applying it to mock millimeter wavelength images of\nSgr A*. The mock image data is generated from General Relativistic\nMagnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulation and general relativistic ray-tracing\nmethod.

Numerical simulations are a valuable tool for\nstudying the accretion-disk--magnetosphere interaction that is central to these\nproblems, most clearly for the recently discovered transitional millisecond\npulsars. However, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) methods, widely used for simulating\naccretion, have difficulty in highly magnetized stellar magnetospheres, while\nforce-free methods, suitable for such regions, cannot include the accreting\ngas. We present an MHD method that can stably evolve essentially force-free,\nhighly magnetized regions, and describe the first time-dependent relativistic\nsimulations of magnetized accretion onto millisecond pulsars. Our axisymmetric\ngeneral-relativistic MHD simulations for the first time demonstrate how the\ninteraction of a turbulent accretion flow with a pulsar's electromagnetic wind\ncan lead to the transition of an isolated pulsar to the accreting state. This\ntransition naturally leads to the formation of relativistic jets, whose power\ncan greatly exceed the power of the isolated pulsar's wind. If the accretion\nrate is below a critical value, the pulsar instead expels the accretion stream.\nMore generally, our simulations produce for the first time the four possible\naccretion regimes, in order of decreasing mass accretion rate: (a) crushed\nmagnetosphere and direct accretion; (b) magnetically channeled accretion onto\nthe stellar poles; (c) the propeller state, where material enters through the\nlight cylinder but is prevented from accreting by the centrifugal barrier; (d)\nalmost perfect exclusion of the accretion flow from the light cylinder by the\npulsar wind. \n\n"}

In the\n3mm wavelength band, we acquired more than 2600 observations, and all but one\nof our 37 sample sources were detected, most of them several times.

Our detection rate and the\nmaximum degree of polarisation found, 2.0%, are comparable to previous surveys,\nall made at much longer wavelengths. We argue that the process generating\ncircular polarisation must not be strongly wavelength dependent, and we propose\nthat the widespread presence of circular polarisation in our short wavelength\nsample dominated by blazars is mostly due to Faraday conversion of the linearly\npolarised synchrotron radiation in the helical magnetic field of the jet.\nCircular polarisation is variable, most notably on time scales comparable to or\nshorter than our median sampling interval <1 month.

This goal is typically accomplished by\ndividing the task in two: collecting data (observing), and constructing models\nto represent that data (theorizing). Owing to the natural tendency for\nspecialization, a disconnect can develop between the best available theories\nand the best available data, potentially delaying advances in our understanding\nnew classes of transients. We introduce MOSFiT: the Modular Open-Source Fitter\nfor Transients, a Python-based package that downloads transient datasets from\nopen online catalogs (e.g., the Open Supernova Catalog), generates Monte Carlo\nensembles of semi-analytical light curve fits to those datasets and their\nassociated Bayesian parameter posteriors, and optionally delivers the fitting\nresults back to those same catalogs to make them available to the rest of the\ncommunity.

In the first case, mainly the energetics of the events is consistent\nwith the proposed progenitor models, while the duration, time variability, as\nwell as the afterglow emission may shed some light on the detailed properties\nof the collapsing massive stars. In the latter case, the recent discovery of\nthe binary neutron star (NS-NS) merger in the gravitational wave observation\nmade by LIGO (GW170817), and the detection of associated electromagnetic\ncounterparts, for the first time gave a direct proof of the NS-NS merger being\na progenitor of a short GRB.\n  In general, all GRBs are believed to be powered by accretion through a\nrotationally supported torus, or by fast rotation of a compact object. For long\nones, the rotation of the progenitor star is a key property in order to support\naccretion over relatively long activity periods, and also to sustain the\nrotation of the black hole itself. The latter is responsible for ejection of\nthe relativistic jets, which are powered due to the extraction of the BH\nrotational energy, mitigated by the accretion torus and magnetic fields.

Similar mechanisms of powering the jet ejection\nmay act in short GRBs, which in this case may freely propagate through the\ninterstellar medium.

Spinning dust is one variety of AME that\ncould be partially polarized and therefore relevant for ongoing and future\ncosmic microwave background polarization studies. The Planck satellite mission\nidentified candidate AME regions in approximately $1^\\circ$ patches that were\nfound to have spectra generally consistent with spinning dust grain models. The\nspectra for one of these regions, G107.2+5.2, was also consistent with\noptically thick free-free emission because of a lack of measurements between 2\nand 20 GHz. Follow-up observations were needed. Therefore, we used the C-band\nreceiver (4 to 8 GHz) and the VEGAS spectrometer at the Green Bank Telescope to\nconstrain the AME mechanism. For the study described in this paper, we produced\nthree band averaged maps at 4.575, 5.625, and 6.125 GHz and used aperture\nphotometry to measure the spectral flux density in the region relative to the\nbackground. We found if the spinning dust description is correct, then the\nspinning dust signal peaks at $30.9 \\pm 1.4$ GHz, and it explains the excess\nemission. The morphology and spectrum together suggest the spinning dust grains\nare concentrated near S140, which is a star forming region inside our chosen\nphotometry aperture. If the AME is sourced by optically thick free-free\nradiation, then the region would have to contain HII with an emission measure\nof $5.27^{+2.5}_{-1.5}\\times 10^8$ $\\rm{cm^{-6}\\,pc}$ and a physical extent of\n$1.01^{+0.21}_{-0.20} \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\rm{pc}$.

The most\nprecise SFHs are usually derived from deep but not very spatially extended\nphotometric data; this might alter the ratio of old to young stars when age\ngradients are present.

{"id": "1807.11474", "contents": "Title: Relating Braking Indices of Young Pulsars to the Dynamics of Superfluid\n  Cores Abstract: Pulsars are stars that emit electromagnetic radiation in well-defined time\nintervals. The frequency of such pulses decays with time as is quantified by\nthe {\\it braking index} ($n$). In the canonical model $n = 3$ for all pulsars,\nbut observational data show that $n \\neq 3$, indicating a limitation of the\nmodel. In this work we present a new approach to study the frequency decay of\nthe rotation of a pulsar, based on an adaptation of the canonical one. We\nconsider the pulsar a star that rotates in vacuum and has a strong magnetic\nfield but, differently from the canonical model, we assume that its moment of\ninertia changes in time due to a uniform variation of a displacement parameter\nin time. We found that the braking index results smaller than the canonical\nvalue as a consequence of an increase in the star's displacement parameter,\nwhose variation is small enough to allow plausible physical considerations that\ncan be applied to a more complex model for pulsars in the future. In\nparticular, this variation is of the order of neutron vortices' creep in\nrotating superfluids. When applied to pulsar data our model yielded values for\nthe stars' braking indices close to the observational ones. The application of\nthis approach to a more complex star model, where pulsars are assumed to have\nsuperfluid interiors, is the next step in probing it. We hypothesize that the\nslow expansion of the displacement parameter might mimic the motion of core\nsuperfluid neutron vortices in realistic models. \n\n"}

With\nlarge-scale two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations of relativistic\nreconnection (i.e., with magnetization $\\sigma\\gg1$) in pair plasmas, we study\nthe long-term evolution of the power-law slope and high-energy cutoff of the\nspectrum of accelerated particles.

At late times, the cutoff scales approximately as $\\gamma_{\\rm\ncut}\\propto \\sqrt{t}$, regardless of the flow magnetization and initial\ntemperature. We show that the particles dominating the high-energy spectral\ncutoff reside in plasmoids, and in particular in a strongly magnetised ring\naround the plasmoid core.

Using data from the GMRT we show\nthat post-correlation beamformation results in a many-folds increase in the\nsignal-to-noise for periodic signals from pulsars and several order of\nmagnitude reduction in the number of false triggers from single pulse events\nlike fast radio bursts (FRBs). This difference arises primarily because the\npost-correlation beam contains less red-noise, as well as less radio frequency\ninterference. The post-correlation beam can also be more easily calibrated than\nthe incoherent or phased array beams. We also discuss two different modes of\npost-correlation beamformation, viz.

Achieving an accurate model of\ninterstellar dust is therefore of great importance. Interstellar dust models\nare usually built based on observational constraints such as starlight\nextinction and polarization, but dynamical constraints such as grain rotation\nare not considered. In this paper, we show that a newly discovered effect by\nHoang et al., so-called RAdiative Torque Disruption (RATD), can act as an\nimportant dynamical constraint for dust models. Using this dynamical\nconstraint, we derive the maximum size of grains that survive in the ISM for\ndifferent dust models, including contact binary, composite, silicate-core, and\namorphous carbon mantle, and compact grain model for the different radiation\nfields. We find that the different dust models have different maximum size due\nto their different tensile strengths, and the largest maximum size corresponds\nto compact grains with the highest tensile strength.

We investigate here the origin of this sequence for the\nsame sample. We show that total attenuations anti-correlate with the starburst\nsizes in radio (3 GHz) with a significance larger than 5sigma and a scatter of\n0.26 dex. More obscured and compact starbursts also show enhanced N2\n(=[NII]/Halpha) ratios and larger line velocity widths that we attribute to an\nincreasing shock contribution toward later merger phases, driven by deeper\ngravitational potential wells at the coalescence. Additionally, the attenuation\nis also linked to the equivalent width (EW) of hydrogen recombination lines,\nwhich is sensitive to the luminosity weighted age of the relatively unobscured\nstellar populations. Overall, the correlations among A(V), radio size, line\nwidth, N2 and EW of Balmer/Paschen lines converge towards suggesting an\nevolutionary sequence of merger stages: all of these quantities are likely to\nbe good time-tracers of the merger phenomenon, and their large spanned range\nappears to be characteristic of the different merger phases.

Spatial fluctuations in the decay rate of the inflaton field to\nordinary matter lead to fluctuations in the reheating temperature. We argue\nthat in most realistic models of inflation the coupling of the inflaton to\nnormal matter is determined by the vacuum expectation values of fields in the\ntheory. If those fields are light during inflation (this is a generic situation\nin the minimal models of supersymmetric inflation) they will fluctuate leading\nto density perturbations through the proposed mechanism. We show that these\nfluctuations could easily dominate over the ones generated through the standard\nmechanism. The new scenario has several consequences for inflation model\nbuilding and observations. The proposed mechanism allows to generate the\nobserved level of density perturbations with a much lower scale of inflation\nand thus generically predicts a smaller level of gravitational waves. The\nrelation between the slope of the spectrum of the produced density\nperturbations and the potential of the inflaton field is different from the\nstandard relations obtained in the context of slow roll inflation. Because the\nfield responsible for the fluctuations is not the inflaton, it can have\nsignificantly larger self couplings and thus density perturbations could be\nnon-Gaussian.

This remnant\ncontains the most energetic pulsar known (PSR J0537-6910), which is surrounded\nby a bright nonthermal nebula that likely represents a toroidal pulsar wind\nterminal shock observed edge-on. We confirm the non-thermal nature of the\ncomet-shaped X-ray emission feature and show that the spectral steepening of\nthis feature away from the pulsar is quantitatively consistent with synchrotron\ncooling of shocked pulsar wind particles flowing downstream at a bulk velocity\nclose to the speed of light.

This thermal component is distributed among various\nclumps of metal-enriched plasma embedded in the low surface brightness\nX-ray-emitting diffuse gas. The relative metal enrichment pattern suggests that\nthe mass of the supernova progenitor is >~ 20M_sun. A comparison of the X-ray\ndata with HST optical images suggests that the explosion site is close to a\ndense cloud, against which a reflection shock is launched.

We have\nimplemented this model in a Monte Carlo algorithm to simulate galaxy formation\nand outflows in a cosmological context. Using this algorithm, we have simulated\nthe evolution of a comoving volume of size [12h^(-1)Mpc]^3 in the LCDM\nuniverse. Starting from a Gaussian density field at redshift z=24, we follow\nthe formation of ~20,000 galaxies, and simulate the galactic outflows produced\nby these galaxies. When these outflows collide with density peaks, ram pressure\nstripping of the gas inside the peak may result. This occurs in around half the\ncases and prevents the formation of galaxies. Anisotropic outflows follow the\npath of least resistance, and thus travel preferentially into low-density\nregions, away from cosmological structures (filaments and pancakes) where\ngalaxies form. As a result, the number of collisions is reduced, leading to the\nformation of a larger number of galaxies. Anisotropic outflows can\nsignificantly enrich low-density systems with metals.

To calculate the transfer of angular momentum from\norbital to spin, we start with two quasi-circular configurations, one with\ninitially non-spinning black holes, the other with corotating black holes. In\nboth cases the binaries complete almost two orbits before merging. We find\nthat, during these last orbits, the specific spin (a/m) of each horizon\nincreases by only 0.012 for the initially non-spinning configuration, and by\nonly 0.006 for the initially corotating configuration. By contrast, the\ncorotation value for the specific spin should increase from 0.1 at the initial\nproper separation of 10M to 0.33 when the proper separation is 5M. Thus the\nspin-orbit coupling is far too weak to tidally lock the binary to a corotating\nstate during the late-inspiral phase. We also study the converse transfer from\nspin into orbital motion. In this case, we start the simulations with parallel,\nhighly-spinning non-boosted black holes. As the collision proceeds, the system\nacquires a non-head-on orbital motion, due to spin-orbit coupling, that leads\nto the radiation of angular momentum.

We propose a new statistical\napproach to examine the dependence of time delays on the complexity of lens\npotentials, such as higher-order perturbations, non-isothermality, and\nsubstructures. Specifically, we introduce a reduced time delay and explore its\nbehavior as a function of the image configuration that is characterized by the\nasymmetry and opening angle of the image pair. In particular we derive a\nrealistic conditional probability distribution. We find that the probability\ndistribution is sensitive to the image configuration such that more asymmetric\nand/or smaller opening angle image pairs are more easily affected by\nperturbations on the primary lens potential. On average time delays of double\nlenses are less scattered than those of quadruple lenses. Furthermore, the\nrealistic conditional distribution allows a new statistical method to constrain\nthe Hubble constant. We find that 16 published time delay quasars constrain the\nHubble constant to be H_0=70+/-6 km/s/Mpc, where the value and its error are\nestimated using jackknife resampling.

Three\nfrequency peaks, all related to this rotation rate, can be explained\nquantitatively.
