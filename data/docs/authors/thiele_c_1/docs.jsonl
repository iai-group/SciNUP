Specifically, for small intial data, we prove\n$L^2$ and $H^1$ global well-posedness for any subcritical nonlinearity (in\ncontrast with the Euclidean case) and with no gauge invariance assumption on\nthe nonlinearity $F$. On the other hand, if $F$ is gauge invariant, $L^2$\ncharge is conserved and hence, as in the Euclidean case, it is possible to\nextend local $L^2$ solutions to global ones. The corresponding argument in\n$H^1$ requires the conservation of energy, which holds under the stronger\ncondition that $F$ is defocusing. Recall that global well-posedness in the\ngauge invariant case was already proved by Banica, Carles & Staffilani, for\nsmall radial $L^2$ data and for large radial $H^1$ data. The second important\napplication of our global Strichartz estimates is \"scattering\" for NLS both in\n$L^2$ and in $H^1$, with no radial or gauge invariance assumption. Notice that,\nin the Euclidean case, this is only possible for the critical power\n$\\gamma=1+\\frac4n$ and can be false for subcritical powers while, on hyperbolic\nspaces, global existence and scattering of small $L^2$ solutions holds for all\npowers $1<\\gamma\\le1+\\frac4n$.

Critical\ntransitions have been observed in an astonishingly diverse set of applications\nfrom ecosystems and climate change to medicine and finance. The main goal of\nthis paper is to give an overview which standard mathematical theories can be\napplied to critical transitions. We shall focus on early-warning signs that\nhave been suggested to predict critical transitions and point out what\nmathematical theory can provide in this context. Starting from classical\nbifurcation theory and incorporating multiple time scale dynamics one can give\na detailed analysis of local bifurcations that induce critical transitions.

Since noise often plays a crucial role near\ncritical transitions the next step is to consider stochastic fast-slow systems.\nThe interplay between sample path techniques, partial differential equations\nand random dynamical systems is highlighted.

Since increasing variance has\nbeen suggested as an early-warning sign we examine it in the context of normal\nforms analytically, numerically and geometrically; we also consider\nautocorrelation numerically.

Based on this elementary classification, we analyze\nstochastic fluctuations and calculate scaling laws of the variance of\nstochastic sample paths near critical transitions for fast subsystem\nbifurcations up to codimension two. The theory is applied to several models:\nthe Stommel-Cessi box model for the thermohaline circulation from geoscience,\nan epidemic-spreading model on an adaptive network, an activator-inhibitor\nswitch from systems biology, a predator-prey system from ecology and to the\nEuler buckling problem from classical mechanics.

J. Nuttall\nhas put forward the important relation between the maximal domain of f where\nthe function has a single-valued branch and the domain of convergence of the\ndiagonal Pade approximants for f. The Pade approximants, which are rational\nfunctions and thus single-valued, approximate a holomorphic branch of f in the\ndomain of their convergence. At the same time most of their poles tend to the\nboundary of the domain of convergence and the support of their limiting\ndistribution models the system of cuts that makes the function f single-valued.\nNuttall has conjectured (and proved for many important special cases) that this\nsystem of cuts has minimal logarithmic capacity among all other systems\nconverting the function f to a single-valued branch. Thus the domain of\nconvergence corresponds to the maximal (in the sense of minimal boundary)\ndomain of single-valued holomorphy for the analytic function f\n\\in\\mathcal{A}(\\bar{\\C} \\setminus A).

Quasiparticle tunneling leads to the\ninclusion of more than two charge states in the dynamics.

Under degeneracy of the electron gas (high concentration, low\ntemperature), a dip at the center of the polarization profile appears with a\npolarization maximum at a distance of about $2 \\; \\mu m$ from the center. This\ncounterintuitive result reveals that photoelectron diffusion depends on spin,\nas a direct consequence of the Pauli principle. This causes a concentration\ndependence of the spin stiffness while the spin dependence of the mobility is\nfound to be weak in doped material. The various effects which can modify spin\ntransport in a degenerate electron gas under local laser excitation are\nconsidered. A comparison of the data with a numerical solution of the coupled\ndiffusion equations reveals that ambipolar coupling with holes increases the\nsteady-state photo-electron density at the excitation spot and therefore the\namplitude of the degeneracy-induced polarization dip.

Given an arc of directions, if a power series is\n1-summable in that arc, then one can attach to it a Borel-Laplace sum, i.e. a\nholomorphic function defined in a large enough sector and asymptotic to that\npower series in Gevrey sense. The second part is an introduction to Ecalle's\nresurgence theory. A power series is said to be resurgent when its Borel\ntransform is convergent and has good analytic continuation properties: there\nmay be singularities but they must be isolated. The analysis of these\nsingularities, through the so-called alien calculus, allows one to compare the\nvarious Borel-Laplace sums attached to the same resurgent 1-summable series.In\nthe context of analytic difference-or-differential equations, this sheds light\non the Stokes phenomenon.

Examples include the\nsynchronization of business cycles, population collapse in patchy ecosystems,\nmarkets shifting to a new technology platform, collapses in prices and in\nconfidence in financial markets, and protests erupting in multiple countries. A\nnumber of mathematical models of these phenomena have multiple equilibria\nseparated by saddle-node bifurcations. We study this behavior in its normal\nform as fast--slow ordinary differential equations. In our model, a system\nconsists of multiple subsystems, such as countries in the global economy or\npatches of an ecosystem. Each subsystem is described by a scalar quantity, such\nas economic output or population, that undergoes sudden changes via saddle-node\nbifurcations. The subsystems are coupled via their scalar quantity (e.g., trade\ncouples economic output; diffusion couples populations); that coupling moves\nthe locations of their bifurcations. The model demonstrates two ways in which\nsudden changes can propagate: they can cascade (one causing the next), or they\ncan hop over subsystems. The latter is absent from classic models of cascades.\nFor an application, we study the Arab Spring protests. After connecting the\nmodel to sociological theories that have bistability, we use socioeconomic data\nto estimate relative proximities to tipping points and Facebook data to\nestimate couplings among countries. We find that although protests tend to\nspread locally, they also seem to \"hop\" over countries, like in the stylized\nmodel; this result highlights a new class of temporal motifs in longitudinal\nnetwork datasets. \n\n"}

But the significant controversy surrounding the nature of\nthe $\\nu = 5/2$ state has been hampered by the fact that the competition\nbetween these and other states is affected by small parameter changes. To study\nthe phase diagram of the $\\nu = 5/2$ state we numerically diagonalize a\ncomprehensive effective Hamiltonian describing the fractional quantum Hall\neffect of electrons under realistic conditions in GaAs semiconductors. The\neffective Hamiltonian takes Landau level mixing into account to lowest-order\nperturbatively in $\\kappa$, the ratio of the Coulomb energy scale to the\ncyclotron gap. We also incorporate non-zero width $w$ of the quantum well and\nsub-band mixing. We find the ground state in both the torus and spherical\ngeometries as a function of $\\kappa$ and $w$. To sort out the non-trivial\ncompetition between candidate ground states we analyze the following 4\ncriteria: its overlap with trial wave functions; the magnitude of energy gaps;\nthe sign of the expectation value of an order parameter for particle-hole\nsymmetry breaking; and the entanglement spectrum.

The purpose of this note is to mention that a recent result by\nJordan and Sahlsten implies that the Fourier transform decays to zero with a\npolynomial speed. \n\n"}

It has become a standard\nsignal and image processing tool and is commonly used in numerous applications\nof different natures. In its common formulation, it relies on the H\\\"older\nexponent as a measure of local regularity, which is by nature restricted to\npositive values and can hence be used for locally bounded functions only. In\nthis contribution, it is proposed to replace the H\\\"older exponent with a\ncollection of novel exponents for measuring local regularity, the\n$p$-exponents.

The discussion of the orthogonality for such a\nsesquilinear form includes, among others, matrix Hankel cases with linear\nfunctionals, general matrix Sobolev orthogonality and discrete orthogonal\npolynomials with an infinite support. The first transformation considered is\nthat of Geronimus type, two different methods are developed. A spectral one,\nbased on the spectral properties of the perturbing polynomial, and constructed\nin terms of the second kind functions. Then, using spectral techniques and\nspectral jets, Christoffel-Geronimus formulas for the transformed polynomials\nand norms are presented. For this type of transformations, the paper also\nproposes an alternative method, which does not require of spectral techniques.\nA discussion on matrix spectral linear transformations is presented, as well.\nThese transformations can be understood as rational perturbations of the matrix\nof bivariate generalized functions together with an addition of appropriate\nmasses, determined these last ones by the spectral properties of the polynomial\ndenominator.

We\ndemonstrate in a joint experimental and theoretical study that gated nanowires\nfabricated from high-mobility strained HgTe, known as a bulk topological\ninsulator, indeed preserve the topological nature of the surface states, that\nmoreover extend phase-coherently across the entire wire geometry. The\nphase-coherence lengths are enhanced up to 5 $\\mu$m when tuning the wires into\nthe bulk gap, so as to single out topological transport. The nanowires exhibit\ndistinct conductance oscillations, both as a function of the flux due to an\naxial magnetic field, and of a gate voltage. The observed $h/e$-periodic\nAharonov-Bohm-type modulations indicate surface-mediated quasi-ballistic\ntransport.

For measures that satisfy a weaker\ncondition than the weak separation condition we prove that finite quasi-Assouad\ndimension is equivalent to quasi-doubling of the measure, a strictly less\nrestrictive property than doubling. Further, we exhibit a large class of such\nmeasures for which the quasi-Assouad dimension coincides with the maximum of\nthe local dimension at the endpoints of the support. This class includes all\nregular, equicontractive self-similar measures satisfying the weak separation\ncondition, such as convolutions of uniform Cantor measures with integer ratio\nof dissection. Other properties of this dimension are also established and many\nexamples are given. \n\n"}

The\napproach was introduced by the author and Jos\\'e L.~Torrea in 2009\n(arXiv:0910.2569v1). The aim of this chapter is to show how the method works in\nthe particular case of the fractional Laplacian $L^s=(-\\Delta)^s$, $0<s<1$. The\nstarting point is the semigroup formula for the fractional Laplacian. From\nhere, the classical heat kernel permits us to obtain the pointwise formula for\n$(-\\Delta)^su(x)$. One of the key advantages is that our technique relies on\nthe use of heat kernels, which allows for applications in settings where the\nFourier transform is not the most suitable tool. In addition, it provides\nexplicit constants that are key to prove, under minimal conditions on $u$, the\nvalidity of the pointwise limits $$\\lim_{s\\to1^-}(-\\Delta)^su(x)=-\\Delta\nu(x)\\quad\\hbox{and}\\quad\\lim_{s\\to0^+}(-\\Delta)^su(x)=u(x).$$ The formula for\nthe solution to the Poisson problem $(-\\Delta)^su=f$ is found through the\nsemigroup approach as the inverse of the fractional Laplacian\n$u(x)=(-\\Delta)^{-s}f(x)$ (fundamental solution). We then present the\nCaffarelli--Silvestre extension problem, whose explicit solution is given by\nthe semigroup formulas that were first discovered by the author and Torrea.\nWith the extension technique, an interior Harnack inequality and derivative\nestimates for fractional harmonic functions can be obtained. The classical\nH\\\"older and Schauder estimates $$(-\\Delta)^{\\pm s}:C^\\alpha\\to C^{\\alpha\\mp\n2s}$$ are proved with the method of semigroups in a rather quick, elegant way.\nThe crucial point for this will be the characterization of H\\\"older and Zygmund\nspaces with heat semigroups. \n\n"}

{"id": "math/0703641", "contents": "Title: Resurgence of the Euler-MacLaurin summation formula Abstract: The Euler-MacLaurin summation formula relates a sum of a function to a\ncorresponding integral, with a remainder term. The remainder term has an\nasymptotic expansion, and for a typical analytic function, it is a divergent\n(Gevrey-1) series. Under some decay assumptions of the function in a half-plane\n(resp. in the vertical strip containing the summation interval), Hardy (resp.\nAbel-Plana) prove that the asymptotic expansion is a Borel summable series, and\ngive an exact Euler-MacLaurin summation formula.\n  Using a mild resurgence hypothesis for the function to be summed, we give a\nBorel summable transseries expression for the remainder term, as well as a\nLaplace integral formula, with an explicit integrand which is a resurgent\nfunction itself. In particular, our summation formula allows for resurgent\nfunctions with singularities in the vertical strip containing the summation\ninterval.\n  Finally, we give two applications of our results. One concerns the\nconstruction of solutions of linear difference equations with a small\nparameter. And another concerns the problem of proving resurgence of formal\npower series associated to knotted objects. \n\n"}

We begin by presenting new and more accurate numerical\nreconstructions of the $N$-soliton by inverse scattering (numerical linear\nalgebra) for N=5, 10, 20, and 40. We then recast the inverse-scattering problem\nas a Riemann-Hilbert problem and provide a rigorous asymptotic analysis of this\nproblem in the large-N limit. For those $(x,t)$ where results have been\nobtained by other authors, we improve the error estimates from $O(N^{-1/3})$ to\n$O(N^{-1})$. We also analyze the Fourier power spectrum in this regime and\nrelate the results to the optical phenomenon of supercontinuum generation. We\nthen study the $N$-soliton for values of $(x,t)$ where analysis has not been\ncarried out before, and we uncover new phenomena. The main discovery of this\npaper is the mathematical mechanism for a secondary caustic (phase transition),\nwhich turns out to differ from the mechanism that generates the primary\ncaustic. The mechanism for the generation of the secondary caustic depends\nessentially on the discrete nature of the spectrum for the $N$-soliton, and\nmore significantly, cannot be recovered from an analysis of an ostensibly\nsimilar Riemann-Hilbert problem in the conditions of which a certain formal\ncontinuum limit is taken on an {\\em ad hoc} basis \n\n"}
