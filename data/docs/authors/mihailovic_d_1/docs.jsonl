Here G_s(k;mu) is the\nsingle-particle Green function of particles with spin index s at the chemical\npotential mu. For the cases where the two-body interaction potential is\nshort-range, and in particular for lattice models, we explicitly demonstrate\nthat this theorem is unconditionally valid, irrespective of the strength of the\nbare interaction potential. We arrive at this conclusion by amongst other\nthings demonstrating that the perturbation series expansion for self-energy in\nterms of skeleton diagrams, as encountered in the proof of the Luttinger-Ward\nidentity, is uniformly convergent for almost all momenta and energies. We\nfurther investigate the mechanisms underlying some reported instances of\nfailure of the Luttinger theorem.

In addition, the physical reason why the\nsuperconductivity does not occur in noble metals (like gold, silver and copper)\nis discussed.

Consequently, by supplementing the Hamiltonian of\nthe SU(N) model with a perturbation Hamiltonian that removes the GS degeneracy,\nthe LT is to apply also for the SU(N) model in the limit of the coupling\nconstant, \\lambda, of this perturbation approaching zero, where the limit\n\\lambda --> 0 is clearly to be taken subsequent to taking the zero-temperature\nlimit of the thermal single-particle Green function in the expression for the\nLuttinger number N_L. We explicitly establish the validity of this statement\nfor the case of N=4. The details of the relevant calculations being distinctly\ntransparent, one can readily convince oneself that our observation is valid for\narbitrary N. It follows that the issues raised by DPK, such as non-existence of\nthe Luttinger-Ward functional and \"breakdown of the elemental particle picture\nin strongly correlated electron matter\", are all inessential to the observed\nfailure of the LT. As regards the singularity of the self-energy \\Sigma(\\omega)\non the real \\omega-axis, observed by DPK, we demonstrate that this also is a\ndirect consequence of the non-uniqueness of the GS of the SU(N) model for 0 < n\n< N.

Fundamental to this problem is the\ncompetition between antiferromagnetic spin correlations, a symptom of strong\nCoulomb interactions, and the kinetic energy of the doped carriers, which\nfavors delocalization. After discussing some of the early challenges in the\nfield, I describe the experimental picture provided by a variety of\nspectroscopic and transport techniques. Then I turn to the technique of neutron\nscattering, and discuss how it is used to determine spin correlations,\nespecially in model systems of quantum magnetism. Neutron scattering and\ncomplementary techniques have determined the extent to which antiferromagnetic\nspin correlations survive in the cuprate superconductors. One experimental case\ninvolves the ordering of spin and charge stripes. I first consider related\nmeasurements on model compounds, such as La(2-x)Sr(x)NiO(4+d), and then discuss\nthe case of La(2-x)Ba(x)CuO(4). In the latter system, recent transport studies\nhave demonstrated that quasi-two-dimensional superconductivity coexists with\nthe stripe order, but with frustrated phase order between the layers. This has\nled to new concepts for the coexistence of spin order and superconductivity.\nWhile the relevance of stripe correlations to high-temperature\nsuperconductivity remains a subject of controversy, there is no question that\nstripes are an intriguing example of electron matter that results from strong\ncorrelations. \n\n"}

In\nthis article, we review theoretical studies of the Fermi liquid theory and\nCooper pairing instabilities of both electric and magnetic dipolar fermionic\nsystems from the perspective of unconventional symmetries. When the electric\ndipole moments are aligned by the external electric field, their interactions\nexhibit the explicit $d_{r^2-3z^2}$ anisotropy. The Fermi liquid properties,\nincluding the single-particle spectra, thermodynamic susceptibilities, and\ncollective excitations, are all affected by this anisotropy. The electric\ndipolar interaction provides a mechanism for the unconventional spin triplet\nCooper pairing, which is different from the usual spin-fluctuation mechanism in\nsolids and the superfluid $^3$He. Furthermore, the competition between pairing\ninstabilities in the singlet and triplet channels gives rise to a novel\ntime-reversal symmetry breaking superfluid state.

The robust s-wave pairing throughout the different\nfamilies of iron-based superconductors at different doping regions signals two\nfundamental principles behind high T_c superconducting mechanisms: (1) the\ncorrespondence principle: the short range magnetic exchange interactions and\nthe Fermi surfaces act collaboratively to achieve high T_c superconductivity\nand determine pairing symmetries; (2) the magnetic selection pairing rule: the\nsuperconductivity is only induced by the magnetic exchange couplings from the\nsuperexchange mechanism through cation-anion-cation chemical bondings. These\nprinciples explain why the unconventional high T_c superconductivity appears to\nbe such a rare but robust phenomena with its strict requirement on electronic\nenvironment.

While there has been intensive\ndiscussion on this issue, all arguments rely strongly on, or are closely\nrelated to, the correlation strength of the materials. Clear understanding has\nbeen seriously hampered by the absence of a direct measure of this interaction,\ntraditionally denoted by $U$.

The $U$ values clearly increase as\na function of the inverse bond distance between apical oxygen and copper. Our\nresults show that the electron-doped cuprates are less correlated than their\nhole-doped counterparts, which supports the Slater picture rather than the Mott\npicture. Further, the $U$ values significantly vary even among the hole-doped\nfamilies. The correlation strengths of the Hg-cuprates are noticeably weaker\nthan that of La$_2$CuO$_4$.

While\nthree-dimensional topological insulators are becoming abundant, two-dimensional\ntopological insulators remain rare, particularly in natural materials. ZrTe5\nhas host a long-standing puzzle on its anomalous transport properties; its\nunderlying origin remains elusive. Lately, ZrTe5 has ignited renewed interest\nbecause it is predicted that single-layer ZrTe5 is a two-dimensional\ntopological insulator and there is possibly a topological phase transition in\nbulk ZrTe5.

Here we report high-resolution laser-based angle-resolved\nphotoemission measurements on ZrTe5. The electronic property of ZrTe5 is\ndominated by two branches of nearly-linear-dispersion bands at the Brillouin\nzone center. These two bands are separated by an energy gap that decreases with\ndecreasing temperature but persists down to the lowest temperature we measured\n(~2 K). The overall electronic structure exhibits a dramatic temperature\ndependence; it evolves from a p-type semimetal with a hole-like Fermi pocket at\nhigh temperature, to a semiconductor around ~135 K where its resistivity\nexhibits a peak, to an n-type semimetal with an electron-like Fermi pocket at\nlow temperature. These results indicate a clear electronic evidence of the\ntemperature-induced Lifshitz transition in ZrTe5.

In the general\ncase, the A1g response includes nonresonant, resonant, and mixed contributions,\nthe B1g response includes nonresonant and resonant contributions (we prove the\nShastry-Shraiman relation for the nonresonant B1g response) while the B2g\nresponse is purely resonant. Three main features are seen in the nonresonant\nB1g channel: (i) the rapid appearance of low-energy spectral weight at the\nexpense of higher-energy weight; (b) the frequency range for this low-energy\nspectral weight is much larger than the onset temperature, where the response\nfirst appears; and (iii) the occurrence of an isosbestic point, which is a\ncharacteristic frequency where the Raman response is independent of temperature\nfor low temperatures.

Two-Component Nonstoichiometric Compounds and the\n  Insulator--Superconductor--Metal Transition Abstract: One of the reasons for the lack of understanding of both the mechanisms\nunderlying the HTSC phenomenon and of the instability of materials with Tc >\n300 K may be the widely accepted but wrong ideas about the types of chemical\nbonding in a substance and the radii of the atoms and ions. A revision of these\nconcepts started in the beginning of the XX century in connection with the\ninvestigation of non-stoichiometric compounds (the berthollides) but did not\nreach a critical level until recently. Most of the HTSC materials, however, are\nactually non-stoichiometric nanocomposites, whose components \"dilute\" or\n\"stretch\" one another. Each component resides in an \"intermediate\" state, which\nstill remains poorly studied. For instance, in a system of particles having two\npaired electrons each, the unbroken electron pairs may start tunneling at a\ncertain \"medium\" concentration with the system becoming a Bose superconductor\n(the state between the insulator and the metal with BCS superconductivity). For\nunivalent atoms (Na,Ag), however, such possibility realizes neither in\nintermediate nor in the final state. Univalent metals are not superconductors.\nIn the berthollides, however, a possible Jahn-Teller-Peierls-type instability\nmay give rise to formation of diatomic molecules (Na2, Ag2)with electron pairs,\nand superconductivity can set in. It is possibly such systems that were\nobtained by chance in experiments with univalent components and reported to\nhave Tc of up to 371 K. Structures of a number of HTSC materials are\nconsidered. \n\n"}

The first threshold defines the\nconventional critical current density Jc and the second defines the depairing\n(or pair-breaking) current Jd. Type II superconductors in the mixed state have\nquantized flux vortices, which tend to move when acted upon by the Lorentz\ndriving force of an applied transport current.

It is determined by\nthe nodes in the fermionic spectrum, which are protected by topology in\nmomentum space (in some cases, in combination with the vacuum symmetry). Close\nto the nodes the behavior of the system becomes universal; and the universality\nclasses are determined by the toplogical invariants in momentum space.

This method is based on the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid theory\nincluding logarithmic corrections which stem from the renormalization of the\nUmklapp- and the backward-scattering effects.\n  Using this approach, the phase boundaries are determined with high accuracy,\nand then the structure of the phase diagram is clarified. At half-filling, the\nphase diagram consists of two\n  Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition lines and one Gaussian\ntransition line in the charge sector, and one spin-gap transition line.\n  This structure reflects the U(1) $\\otimes$ SU(2) symmetry of the electron\nsystem. Near the $U=2V$ line, the Gaussian and the spin-gap transitions take\nplace independently from the weak- to the intermediate-coupling region, but\nthese two transition lines are coupled in the strong-coupling region.
