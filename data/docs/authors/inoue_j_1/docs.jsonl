For\nMittag-Leffler type distribution, the average waiting time (residual life time)\nis strongly dependent on the choice of a cut-off parameter t_ max, whereas the\nresults based on the Weibull distribution do not depend on such a cut-off.\nTherefore, a Weibull distribution is more convenient than a Mittag-Leffler type\none if one wishes to evaluate relevant statistics such as average waiting time\nin financial markets with long durations. On the other side, we find that the\nGini index is rather independent of the cut-off parameter.

The first paradox concerns the\napparent non-existence of the signature of the electron pockets in angle\nresolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). The second paradox is a clear\nsignature of a small electron pocket in quantum oscillation experiments, but no\nevidence as yet of the corresponding hole pockets of approximately double the\nfrequency of the electron pocket. This hole pockets should be present if the\nFermi surface reconstruction is due to a commensurate density wave, assuming\nthat Luttinger sum rule relating the area of the pockets and the total number\nof charge carriers holds. Here we provide possible resolutions of these\napparent paradoxes from the commensurate $d$-density wave theory. To address\nthe first paradox we have computed the ARPES spectral function subject to\ncorrelated disorder, natural to a class of experiments relevant to the\nmaterials studied in quantum oscillations. The intensity of the spectral\nfunction is significantly reduced for the electron pockets for an intermediate\nrange of disorder correlation length, and typically less than half the hole\npocket is visible, mimicking Fermi arcs. Next we show from an exact transfer\nmatrix calculation of the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillation that the usual disorder\naffects the electron pocket more significantly than the hole pocket. However,\nwhen, in addition, the scattering from vortices in the mixed state is included,\nit wipes out the frequency corresponding to the hole pocket. Thus, if we are\ncorrect, it will be necessary to do measurements at higher magnetic fields and\neven higher quality samples to recover the hole pocket frequency. \n\n"}

However, for a range of Zeeman coupling above the critical\nvalue, the lowest energy excited state inside a vortex is a zero-energy\nMajorana fermion state. The system, thus, has entered into a non-Abelian s-wave\nsuperconducting state via a topological quantum phase transition (TQPT) tuned\nby the Zeeman coupling. In the one-dimensional version of the same structure\nand for the Zeeman coupling above the critical value, there are localized\nMajorana zero-energy modes at the two ends of a semiconducting quantum\nnanowire.

As a consequence, since memristances, memcapacitances, and\nmeminductances are simply response functions, they are not necessarily finite.\nThis means that, unlike what has always been argued in some literature,\ndiverging and non-crossing input-output curves of all these memory elements are\nphysically possible in both quantum and classical regimes.

The robust s-wave pairing throughout the different\nfamilies of iron-based superconductors at different doping regions signals two\nfundamental principles behind high T_c superconducting mechanisms: (1) the\ncorrespondence principle: the short range magnetic exchange interactions and\nthe Fermi surfaces act collaboratively to achieve high T_c superconductivity\nand determine pairing symmetries; (2) the magnetic selection pairing rule: the\nsuperconductivity is only induced by the magnetic exchange couplings from the\nsuperexchange mechanism through cation-anion-cation chemical bondings. These\nprinciples explain why the unconventional high T_c superconductivity appears to\nbe such a rare but robust phenomena with its strict requirement on electronic\nenvironment.

Here, by utilizing a Lindblad-based\ndensity-matrix approach enabling us to account for both dissipation and\ndecoherence effects, we test such prediction by analyzing various aspects that\nwere so far unexplored. In particular, accounting for initial nonequilibrium\nexcitations, characterized by an excess energy $E_0$, and including both intra-\nand interband phonon scattering, we show that for realistically high values of\n$E_0$ the electronic diffusion is extremely small and nearly independent of its\nenergetic distribution, in spite of a significant energy-dissipation and\ndecoherence dynamics. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the effect is robust\nwith respect to the variation of the chemical potential. Our results thus\nsuggest that metallic SWNTs are a promising platform to realise quantum\nchannels for the non-dispersive transmission of electronic wave packets. \n\n"}

Interestingly, in the regime of strong\nsuperconductor-nanowire tunneling, we find that the presence of two nanowires\nallows for the conversion of non-local odd-frequency pairing to local\neven-frequency pairing. By studying this higher-order symmetry conversion\nprocess, we are able to identify a notable effect of the odd-frequency pairing\nin the superconductor on local quantities accessible by experiments.\nSpecifically, we find that the odd-frequency pairing plays a direct role in the\nemergence of certain subgap features in the local density of states, and,\nimportantly, it is responsible for a reduction of the maximum Josephson current\nbetween the two nanowires, measurable using Josephson scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy.

This paper proposes a realization of topological\nsuperconductivity in a short Josephson junction at an edge of a 2D topological\ninsulator subject to a perpendicular magnetic field. The magnetic field effect\nis entirely orbital, coming from a gradient of the order parameter phase at the\nedge, which results in a soliton defect at the junction with a pair of gapless\nAndreev bound states. The latter are reducible to Majorana zero modes by a\nunitary rotation and protected by a chiral symmetry. Furthermore, both ground\nstate and excitations are quasiperiodic in the magnetic flux enclosed in the\njunction, with the period equal to the double flux quantum $2\\Phi_0 = h/e$.\nThis behaviour follows from the gauge invariance of the $4\\pi$ - phase\nperiodicity of the Majorana states and manifests itself as $2\\Phi_0$ - spaced\nmagnetic oscillations of the critical current.

When represented in Fock space, the Hamiltonian of such a\nsystem looks like that of a single particle hopping on a Fock lattice in the\npresence of a random disordered potential. The coordination number of the Fock\nlattice increases linearly with the system size L in 1D. Thus in the\nthermodynamic limit, the disordered interacting problem in 1D maps on to an\nAnderson model with infinite coordination number. Despite this, this system\ndisplays localization which appears counterintuitive. A close observation of\nthe on-site disorders on the Fock lattice reveals a large degree of correlation\namong them as they are derived from an exponentially smaller number of on-site\ndisorders in real space. This indicates that the correlations between the\non-site disorders on a Fock lattice has a strong effect on the localization\nproperties of the corresponding many-body system.

Single Particle Green's Function\n  and Photoemission in Cuprates Abstract: Experimental evidence indicates that the superconducting transition in high\n$T_c$ cuprates is an 'undressing' transition. Microscopic mechanisms giving\nrise to this physics were discussed in the first paper of this series. Here we\ndiscuss the calculation of the single particle Green's function and spectral\nfunction for Hamiltonians describing undressing transitions in the normal and\nsuperconducting states. A single parameter, $\\Upsilon$, describes the strength\nof the undressing process and drives the transition to superconductivity.

The\nconnection between quantum groups and strings is one way of seeing the validity\nof our previous conjecture [i.e. that a theory for cuprates may be constructed\non the basis of quantum groups]. The cuprates seems to exhibit statistics,\ndimensionality and phase transitions in novel ways. The nature of excitations\n[i.e. quasiparticle or collective] must be understood. The Hubbard model\ncaptures some of the behaviour of the phase transitions in these materials. On\nthe other hand the phases such as stripes in these materials bear relationship\nto quantum group or string-like solutions. One thus expects that the relevant\nsolutions of Hubbard model may thus be written in terms of stringy solutions.\nIn short this approach may lead to the non-perturbative formualtion of Hubbard\nand other condensed matter Hamiltonians. The question arises that how a 1-d\nbased symmetry such as quantum groups can be relevant in describing a 3-d\n[spatial dimensions] system such as cuprates. The answer lies in the key\nobservation that strings which are 1-d objects can be used to describe physics\nin $d$ dimensions.

The suggestion that this represents dephasing by zero-point\nfluctuations has generated both theoretical and experimental controversies.

Within this theory the puzzling physics of the\ncuprates is shown to be a behavior specific of their structure, within the\nregime of a Mott transition. The translational symmetry within the CuO_2 planes\nis disturbed by dynamical stripe-like inhomogeneities, which provide\nquasi-one-dimensional segments where the large-U scenario of separation between\nspin and charge is materialized. However, these charge carriers gain itineracy\nonly due to the coupling with electrons in the regions where spin and charge\nare inseparable. Consequently a two-component scenario is obtained of heavy and\nlight charge carriers, which are coupled through spin carriers.

It was also found that the limit price,\non the coarse-grained price scale, tends to gather around the price which has a\nlarge size of cumulative unexecuted limit orders. \n\n"}

In the unitarity regime the\nbreathing mode frequency is found to limit to the non-interacting value. A\ndynamical instability, similar to the Bosenova, is predicted to be possible in\ngases containing more than three spin components, for large, negative, two-body\nscattering lengths. \n\n"}

Three-dimensional reconstructions of the system of channels\nunderlying bone structure are obtained by using histological and computer\ngraphics methods and then represented in terms of complex networks.\nCon&#64258;uences of two or more channels are represented as nodes, while the\ninterconnecting channels are expressed as edges. The hierarchical backbone (the\ntree with maximum depth) of such a network is obtained and understood to\ncorrespond to the main structure underlying the channel system. The remainder\nof the network is shown to correspond to geographical communities, suggesting\nthat the bone channel structure involves a number of regular communities\nappended along the hierarchical backbone. It is shown that such additional\nedges play a crucial role in enhancing the network resilience and in reducing\nthe shortest paths in both topology and geometry.The recently introduced\nconcept of fractal dimension of a network (cond-mat/0503078) is then correlated\nwith the resilience of the several components of the bone channel structure to\nobstruction and failure, with important implications for the understanding of\nthe organization and robustness of cortical bone structure. \n\n"}

A precise relation\nbetween entanglement and energy fluctuations is demonstrated in the weak\ncoupling limit. Examples are given with the two-state system and the harmonic\noscillator, and energy probability distributions are calculated. Comparisons\nmade with recent qubit experiments show this type of measurement provides\nanother method to quantify entanglement with the environment. \n\n"}

{"id": "quant-ph/0702109", "contents": "Title: Vector Cooper Pairs and Coherent-Population-Trapping-like States in\n  Ensemble of Interacting Fermions Abstract: Using the standard Hamiltonian of the BCS theory, we show that in an ensemble\nof interacting fermions with the spin 1/2 there exist coherent states $|NC>$,\nwhich nullify the Hamiltonian of the interparticle interaction (scattering).\nThese states have an analogy with the well-known in quantum optics the coherent\npopulation trapping (CPT) effect. The structure of these CPT-like states\ncorresponds to Cooper pairs with the total spin $S$=1. The found states have a\nhuge degree of degeneracy and carry a macroscopic magnetic moment, that allows\nus to construct a new model of the magnetism connected with the delocalized\nelectrons in metals (conductors). A principal possibility to apply the obtained\nresults to the superfluid $^3$He is also demonstrated. \n\n"}
