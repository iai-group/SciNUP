Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on\nthe role that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in\nglobular clusters, e.g., influencing the distribution of horizontal branch\nstars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of some globular clusters, and in\nforming low mass white dwarfs. \n\n"}

In this paper we select\na large sample of centrals and satellites from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\n(SDSS) and measure the kinematics (velocity dispersions) of the satellite\ngalaxies as a function of the $r$-band luminosity of the central galaxies.\nUsing the analytical framework presented in Paper I, we use these data to infer\n{\\it both} the mean and the scatter of the MLR of central galaxies, carefully\ntaking account of selection effects and biases introduced by the stacking\nprocedure.

By performing an ensemble of radiation-hydrodynamic\nsimulations, we show that such discs fragment within a few thousand years, and\nproduce mainlybrown dwarf (BDs) stars, but also planetary mass (PM) stars and\nvery low-mass hydrogen-burning (HB) stars. Most of the the PM stars and BDs are\nejected by mutual interactions. We analyse the statistical properties of these\nstars, and compare them with observations. After a few hundred thousand years\nthe Sun-like primary is typically left with a close low-mass HB companion, and\ntwo much wider companions: a low-mass HB star and a BD star, or a BD-BD binary.\nThere is a BD desert extending out to at least ~100 AU; this is because BDs\ntend to be formed further out than low-mass HB stars, and then they tend to be\nscattered even further out, or even into the field. BDs form with discs of a\nfew Mj and radii of a few tens of AU, and they are more likely to retain these\ndiscs if they remain bound to the primary star. Binaries form by pairing of the\nnewly-formed stars in the disc, giving a low-mass binary fraction of ~0.16.\nThese binaries include close and wide BD/BD binaries and BD/PM binaries.

Galactic\n  Structure, Fundamental Parameters and Non-Circular Motions Abstract: We are using the VLBA and the Japanese VERA project to measure trigonometric\nparallaxes and proper motions of masers found in high-mass star-forming regions\nacross the Milky Way. Early results from 18 sources locate several spiral arms.\nThe Perseus spiral arm has a pitch angle of 16 +/- 3 degrees, which favors four\nrather than two spiral arms for the Galaxy. Combining positions, distances,\nproper motions, and radial velocities yields complete 3-dimensional kinematic\ninformation. We find that star forming regions on average are orbiting the\nGalaxy ~15 km/s slower than expected for circular orbits. By fitting the\nmeasurements to a model of the Galaxy, we estimate the distance to the Galactic\ncenter R_o = 8.4 +/- 0.6 kpc and a circular rotation speed Theta_o = 254 +/- 16\nkm/s. The ratio Theta_o/R_o can be determined to higher accuracy than either\nparameter individually, and we find it to be 30.3 +/- 0.9 km/s/kpc, in good\nagreement with the angular rotation rate determined from the proper motion of\nSgr A*. The data favor a rotation curve for the Galaxy that is nearly flat or\nslightly rising with Galactocentric distance. Kinematic distances are generally\ntoo large, sometimes by factors greater than two; they can be brought into\nbetter agreement with the trigonometric parallaxes by increasing Theta_o/R_o\nfrom the IAU recommended value of 25.9 km/s/kpc to a value near 30 km/s/kpc. We\noffer a \"revised\" prescription for calculating kinematic distances and their\nuncertainties, as well as a new approach for defining Galactic coordinates.\nFinally, our estimates of Theta_o and To/R_o, when coupled with direct\nestimates of R_o, provide evidence that the rotation curve of the Milky Way is\nsimilar to that of the Andromeda galaxy, suggesting that the dark matter halos\nof these two dominant Local Group galaxy are comparably massive. \n\n"}

We argue that in principle it would\nbe better to fit the foregrounds non-parametrically - allowing the data to\ndetermine their shape - rather than selecting some functional form in advance\nand then fitting its parameters. Non-parametric fits often suffer from other\nproblems, however. We discuss these before suggesting a non-parametric method,\nWp smoothing, which seems to avoid some of them.

First we demonstrate that some\nsize evolution of the population can be expected simply due to the continuous\nemergence of early-type galaxies. SDSS data reveal that in the present-day\nuniverse more compact early-type galaxies with a given dynamical mass have\nolder stellar populations. In contrast, at a given stellar velocity dispersion,\nSDSS data show that there is no relation between size and age, which implies\nthat the velocity dispersion can be used to estimate the epoch at which\ngalaxies stopped forming stars, turning into early-type galaxies. Applying such\na 'formation' criterion to a large sample of nearby early-type galaxies, we\npredict the redshift evolution in the size distribution and the comoving mass\ndensity. The resulting evolution in the mean size is roughly half of the\nobserved evolution. Then we include a prescription for the merger histories of\ngalaxies between the 'formation' redshift and the present, based on\ncosmological simulations of the assembly of dark matter halos. Such mergers\nafter the transformation into an early-type galaxy are presumably\ndissipationless ('dry'), where the increase in size is expected to be\napproximately proportional to the increase in mass. This model successfully\nreproduces the observed evolution since z~2 in the mean size and in the\ncomoving mass density of massive early-type galaxies. We conclude that the\nrecently measured, substantial size evolution of early-type galaxies can be\nexplained by the combined effect of the continuous emergence of galaxies as\nearly types and their subsequent growth through dry merging. \n\n"}

The goal of the Coma survey\nwas to measure precise rotation periods for main-sequence F, G and K dwarfs in\nthis intermediate-age (~600 Myr) cluster, and to determine the extent to which\nmagnetic braking has caused the stellar spin periods to converge. We find a\ntight, almost linear relationship between rotation period and J-K colour with a\nroot-mean square scatter of only 2 percent. The relation is similar to that\nseen among F, G and K stars in the Hyades. Such strong convergence can only be\nexplained if angular momentum is not at present being transferred from a\nreservoir in the deep stellar interiors to the surface layers. We conclude that\nthe coupling timescale for angular momentum transport from a rapidly-spinning\nradiative core to the outer convective zone must be substantially shorter than\nthe cluster age, and that from the age of Coma onward, stars rotate effectively\nas solid bodies.

Yet, models based on the CDM scenario invariably\nform galaxies with dense spheroidal stellar \"bulges\" and steep central DM\nprofiles, as low angular momentum baryons and DM sink to the center of galaxies\nthrough accretion and repeated mergers.

This failure is potentially\ncatastrophic for the CDM model, possibly requiring a different DM particle\ncandidate. This Letter presents new hydrodynamical simulations in a Lambda$CDM\nframework where analogues of dwarf galaxies, bulgeless and with a shallow\ncentral DM profile, are formed. This is achieved by resolving the inhomogeneous\ninterstellar medium, resulting in strong outflows from supernovae explosions\nwhich remove low angular momentum gas.

Consequently\nthe cosmological and astrophysical constraints on the gravitino abundance, and\nhence on the reheating temperature, become softer than in the usual case. On\nthe other hand, such small mass splittings generically imply a much longer\nlifetime for the NLSP.

Neither the hypothesis that galaxies which formed earlier\nhave much higher densities nor their luminosity evolution, mergers ratio, or\nmassive outflows due to a quasar feedback mechanism are enough to justify such\na strong size evolution. Also, at high redshift, the intrinsic ultraviolet\nsurface brightness would be prohibitively high with this evolution, and the\nvelocity dispersion much higher than observed. We explore here another\npossibility to overcome this problem by considering different cosmological\nscenarios that might make the observed angular sizes compatible with a weaker\nevolution.\n  One of the models explored, a very simple phenomenological extrapolation of\nthe linear Hubble law in a Euclidean static universe, fits the angular size vs.\nredshift dependence quite well, which is also approximately proportional to 1/z\nwith this cosmological model.

We\ninfer the X-ray mass estimate deriving the density and temperature profiles of\nthe intra-cluster medium within the radius r ~ 700 kpc through a non-parametric\napproach; assuming that the cluster is in hydrostatic equilibrium and adopting\na matter density profile, we can recover the total mass distribution of Abell\n611 via the X-ray data. We derive the total projected mass in the central\nregion of Abell 611 performing a parametric analysis of its strong lensing\nfeatures through the publicly available analysis software Lenstool. As a final\nstep we compare the results obtained with both methods. We derive a good\nagreement between the X-ray and strong lensing total mass estimates in the\ncentral region (i.e. within the radius r ~100 kpc), while a marginal\ndisagreement is found between the two mass estimates when extrapolating the\nstrong lensing results in the outer spatial range. We suggest that in this case\nthe X-ray/strong lensing mass disagreement can be explained by an incorrect\nestimate of the relative contributions of the baryonic component and of the\ndark matter, caused by the intrinsic degeneracy between the different mass\ncomponents in the strong lensing analysis. We discuss the effect of some\npossible systematic errors that influence both mass estimates.

Here, we describe a novel methodology for\nutilising these observations of high-excitation CO to derive the underlying\nSchmidt (SFR-rho^N) relationship. To do this requires an understanding of the\npotential effects of differential CO excitation with SFR. If the most heavily\nstar-forming galaxies have a larger fraction of their gas in highly excited CO\nstates than the lower SFR galaxies, then the observed molecular SFR-CO^alpha\nindex, alpha, will be less than the underlying (volumetric) Schmidt index, N.\nUtilising a combination of SPH models of galaxy evolution and molecular line\nradiative transfer, we present the first calculations of CO excitation in z~2\ndisc galaxies with the aim of developing a mapping between various observed\nSFR-CO relationships and the underlying Schmidt relation. We find that even in\nrelatively luminous z~2 discs, differential excitation does indeed exist,\nresulting in alpha < N for highly excited CO lines.

We interpret the observed SEDs of 16 ULIRGs using\nthis physically-motivated model which accounts for the emission of stellar\npopulations from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared and for the attenuation\nby dust in two components: an optically-thick starburst component and the\ndiffuse ISM. The infrared emission is computed by assuming that all the energy\nabsorbed by dust in these components is re-radiated at mid- and far-infrared\nwavelengths. This model allows us to derive statistically physical properties\nincluding star formation rates, stellar masses, as well as temperatures and\nmasses of different dust components and plausible star formation histories. We\nfind that, although the ultraviolet to near-infrared emission represents only a\nsmall fraction of the total power radiated by ULIRGs, observations in this\nwavelength range are important to understand the properties of the stellar\npopulations and dust attenuation in the diffuse ISM of these galaxies.\nFurthermore, our analysis indicates that the use of mid-infrared spectroscopy\nfrom the Infrared Spectrograph on the Spitzer Space Telescope is crucial to\nobtain realistic estimates of the extinction to the central energy source,\nmainly via the depth of the 9.7-micron silicate feature, and thus accurately\nconstrain the total energy balance. Our findings are consistent with the notion\nthat, in the local Universe, the physical properties of ULIRGs are\nfundamentally different from those of galaxies with lower infrared luminosities\nand that local ULIRGs are the result of merger-induced starbursts.

We investigate DLA kinematics at z=3 using\nhigh-resolution cosmological hydrodynamical simulations that include a\nheuristic model for galactic outflows. Without outflows, our simulations fail\nto yield enough wide DLAs, as in previous studies. With outflows, predicted DLA\nkinematics are in much better agreement with observations. Comparing two\noutflow models, we find that a model based on momentum-driven wind scalings\nprovides the best match to the observed DLA kinematic statistics of Prochaska &\nWolfe. In this model, DLAs typically arise a few kpc away from galaxies that\nwould be identified in emission. Narrow DLAs can arise from any halo and galaxy\nmass, but wide ones only arise in halos with mass >10^11 Mo, from either large\ncentral or small satellite galaxies. This implies that the success of this\noutflow model originates from being most efficient at pushing gas out from\nsmall satellite galaxies living in larger halos. This increases the\ncross-section for large halos relative to smaller ones, thereby yielding wider\nkinematics. Our simulations do not include radiative transfer effects or\ndetailed metal tracking, and outflows are modeled heuristically, but they\nstrongly suggest that galactic outflows are central to understanding DLA\nkinematics. An interesting consequence is that DLA kinematics may place\nconstraints on the nature and efficiency of gas ejection from high-z galaxies. \n\n"}

Evolution of Star Formation Activity as a\n  Function of Stellar Mass in Galaxies since z~3 Abstract: We study the evolution of star formation activity of galaxies at 0.5<z<3.5 as\na function of stellar mass, using very deep NIR data taken with Multi-Object\nInfrared Camera and Spectrograph (MOIRCS) on the Subaru telescope in the\nGOODS-North region. The NIR imaging data reach K ~ 23-24 Vega magnitude and\nthey allow us to construct a nearly stellar mass-limited sample down to ~\n10^{9.5-10} Msun even at z~3.

The SFR distribution at a fixed Mstar shifts to\nhigher values with increasing redshift at 0.5<z<3.5. More massive galaxies show\nstronger evolution of SFR at z>~1.

Galaxies in the low-SSFR group\nhave SSFRs of ~ 0.5-1.0 Gyr^{-1}, while the high-SSFR population shows ~10\nGyr^{-1}. The cosmic SFRD is dominated by galaxies with Mstar = 10^{10-11} Msun\nat 0.5<z<3.5, while the contribution of massive galaxies with Mstar =\n10^{11-11.5} Msun shows a strong evolution at z>1 and becomes significant at\nz~3, especially in the case with the SFR based on MIPS 24um.

The spectral capabilities of X-ray CCDs\nhave been particularly important in detecting relativistic emission lines from\nthe inner disks around accreting neutron stars and black holes. One drawback of\nX-ray CCDs is that spectra can be distorted by photon \"pile-up\", wherein two or\nmore photons may be registered as a single event during one frame time. We have\nconducted a large number of simulations using a statistical model of photon\npile-up to assess its impacts on relativistic disk line and continuum spectra\nfrom stellar-mass black holes and neutron stars. The simulations cover the\nrange of current X-ray CCD spectrometers and operational modes typically used\nto observe neutron stars and black holes in X-ray binaries.

We\nresolve the emission from the protostar radio Source I and BN at several\nepochs. Source I is highly elongated NW-SE, and remarkably stable in flux\ndensity, position angle, and overall morphology over nearly a decade. This\nfavors the extended emission component arising from an ionized disk rather than\na jet. We have measured the proper motions of Source I and BN for the first\ntime at 43 GHz. We confirm that both sources are moving at high speed (12 and\n26 km/s, respectively) approximately in opposite directions, as previously\ninferred from measurements at lower frequencies. We discuss dynamical scenarios\nthat can explain the large motions of both BN and Source I and the presence of\ndisks around both. Our new measurements support the hypothesis that a close\n(~50 AU) dynamical interaction occurred around 500 years ago between Source I\nand BN as proposed by Gomez et al. From the dynamics of encounter we argue that\nSource I today is likely to be a binary with a total mass on the order of 20\nMsun, and that it probably existed as a softer binary before the close\nencounter. This enables preservation of the original accretion disk, though\ntruncated to its present radius of ~50 AU. N-body numerical simulations show\nthat the dynamical interaction between a binary of 20 Msun total mass (I) and a\nsingle star of 10 Msun mass (BN) may lead to the ejection of both and binary\nhardening. The gravitational energy released in the process would be large\nenough to power the wide-angle flow traced by H2 and CO emission in the BN/KL\nnebula. Assuming the proposed dynamical history is correct, the smaller mass\nfor Source I recently estimated from SiO maser dynamics (>7 Msun) by Matthews\net al., suggests that non-gravitational forces (e.g. magnetic) must play an\nimportant role in the circumstellar gas dynamics. \n\n"}

Abstract: We use a coupled model of the formation and evolution of galaxies and black\nholes (BH) to study the evolution of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in a cold\ndark matter universe. The model predicts the BH mass, spin and mass accretion\nhistory. BH mass grows via accretion triggered by discs becoming dynamically\nunstable or galaxy mergers (called the starburst mode) and accretion from\nquasi-hydrostatic hot gas haloes (called the hot-halo mode). By taking into\naccount AGN obscuration, we obtain a very good fit to the observed luminosity\nfunctions (LF) of AGN (optical, soft and hard X-ray, and bolometric) for a wide\nrange of redshifts (0<z<6). The model predicts a hierarchical build up of BH\nmass, with the typical mass of actively growing BHs increasing with decreasing\nredshift. Remarkably, despite this, we find downsizing in the AGN population,\nin terms of the differential growth with redshift of the space density of faint\nand bright AGN. This arises naturally from the interplay between the starburst\nand hot-halo accretion modes. The faint end of the LF is dominated by massive\nBHs experiencing quiescent accretion via a thick disc, primarily during the\nhot-halo mode. The bright end of the LF, on the other hand, is dominated by AGN\nwhich host BHs accreting close to or in excess of the Eddington limit during\nthe starburst mode. The model predicts that the comoving space density of AGN\npeaks at z~3, similar to the star formation history. However, when taking into\naccount obscuration, the space density of faint AGN peaks at lower redshift\n(z<2) than that of bright AGN (z~2-3). This implies that the cosmic evolution\nof AGN is shaped in part by obscuration. \n\n"}

In one of them, corresponding to the value of the coupling being of order\nunity, the network's stress-energy power spectrum is dominated by populous\nlight F and D strings, while the other regime, at smaller values of g_s, has\nthe spectrum dominated by rare heavy D strings.

These oscillations induce time varying CP-odd nuclear moments,\nsuch as electric dipole and Schiff moments. The coupling between internal\natomic fields and these nuclear moments gives rise to time varying shifts to\natomic energy levels. These effects can be enhanced by using elements with\nlarge Schiff moments such as the light Actinides, and states with large\nspontaneous parity violation, such as molecules in a background electric field.\nThe energy level shift in such a molecule can be ~ 10^-24 eV or larger.

Then, we take into account pressure effects\n(coming from special relativity) in the evolution of the cosmic fluid and add\nthe contribution of radiation, baryons and dark energy (cosmological constant).\nFor a BEC dark matter with repulsive self-interaction (positive pressure) the\nscale factor increases more rapidly than in the standard \\Lambda CDM model\nwhere dark matter is pressureless while for a BEC dark matter with attractive\nself-interaction (negative pressure) it increases less rapidly. We study the\nlinear development of the perturbations in these two cases and show that the\nperturbations grow faster in a BEC dark matter than in a pressureless dark\nmatter. This confirms a recent result of Harko (2011). Finally, we consider a\n\"dark fluid\" with a generalized equation of state p=(\\alpha \\rho + k \\rho\n^2)c^2 having a component p=k \\rho ^2 c^2 similar to a BEC dark matter and a\ncomponent p=\\alpha \\rho c^2 mimicking the effect of the cosmological constant\n(dark energy).

Radio morphology classes include core-only (core), core-lobe (lobe),\ncore-jet (jet), lobe-core-lobe (triple), and double-lobe. We examine the\noptical colors of radio-morphology subsamples and find that radio quasars with\ncore emission unresolved by FIRST (on 5\" scale) have a redder color\ndistribution than radio-quiet quasars (S_{20}<1mJy); other classes of radio\nquasars have optical color distributions similar to the radio-quiet quasars.\nThis analysis also suggests that optical colors of z<2.7 SDSS quasars are not\nstrongly (<0.1mag) biased blue. We show that the radio core-to-lobe flux\ndensity ratio (R) and the radio-to-optical (i-band) ratio of the quasar core\n(RI) are correlated, suggesting that both parameters are indicative of\nline-of-sight orientation.

We focus on the effect of an expanding\nuniverse on massive objects on the scale of galaxies and clusters. Using\nNewtonian and general-relativistic approaches, we identify two important\ntime-dependent physical radii for such objects when the cosmological expansion\nis accelerating. The first radius, $r_F$, is that at which the total radial\nforce on a test particle is zero, which is also the radius of the largest\npossible circular orbit about the central mass $m$ and where the gas pressure\nand its gradient vanish. The second radius, $r_S$, which is \\approx r_F/1.6$,\nis that of the largest possible stable circular orbit, which we interpret as\nthe theoretical maximum size for an object of mass $m$. In contrast, for a\ndecelerating cosmological expansion, no such finite radii exist.

The afterglow was\nundetected in the optical and near-IR, implying an optical to X-ray index <0.3,\nidentifying GRB 080207 as a dark burst.

This is because the power\nspectrum completely quantifies Gaussian random fields, which the CMB and LSS\nfields seem to be at early epochs. However, at late epochs and small scales,\ncosmological density fields become highly non-Gaussian. The power spectrum\nloses power to describe LSS and CMB fields on small scales, most obviously\nthrough high covariance in the power spectrum as a function of scale.\nPractically, this significantly degrades constraints that observations can\nplace on cosmological parameters. However, if a nonlinear transformation that\nproduces a (more) Gaussian 1-point distribution is applied to a field, the\nextra covariance in the field's power spectrum can be dramatically reduced.

Thus, it has\nbeen suggested recently that the problems of dark energy and the origin of\ncosmic magnetic fields could be pointing to a modification of Maxwell's theory\non large scales. Here, we review such a proposal in which the scalar state\nwhich is usually eliminated be means of the Lorenz condition is allowed to\npropagate. On super-Hubble scales, the new mode is essentially given by the\ntemporal component of the electromagnetic potential and contributes as an\neffective cosmological constant to the energy-momentum tensor. The new state\ncan be generated from quantum fluctuations during inflation and it is shown\nthat the predicted value for the cosmological constant agrees with observations\nprovided inflation took place at the electroweak scale. We also consider more\ngeneral theories including non-minimal couplings to the space-time curvature in\nthe presence of the temporal electromagnetic background. We show that both in\nthe minimal and non-minimal cases, the modified Maxwell's equations include new\neffective current terms which can generate magnetic fields from sub-galactic\nscales up to the present Hubble horizon.

We argue that in the dual picture the contact\nterm is saturated by the D2 branes which can be interpreted as the tunnelling\nevents in Minkowski space-time. We quote a number of direct lattice results\nsupporting this identification. We also argue that the contact term receives a\nCasimir -like correction $\\sim (\\Lqcd R)^{-1}$ rather than naively expected\n$\\exp(-\\Lqcd R)$ when the Minkowski space-time ${\\cal R}_{3,1}$ is replaced by\na large but finite manifold with a size $R$. Such a behaviour is consistent\nwith other QFT-based computations when power like corrections are due to\nnontrivial properties of topological sectors of the theory. In holographic\ndescription such a behaviour is due to massless Ramond-Ramond (RR) field living\nin the bulk of multidimensional space when power like corrections is a natural\noutcome of massless RR field. In many respects the phenomenon is similar to the\nAharonov -Casher effect when the \"modular electric field\" can penetrate into a\nsuperconductor where the electric field is exponentially screened.

Each\nmodel requires a very high value for the dust scale-length (h(dust) = 2 - 5\nh(stars)), higher dust masses than previous models of NGC 4244 (Md = 0.47 -\n1.39 \\times 10e7 Msun) and a face-on optical depth of {\\tau}(V) = 0.4 - 1.12,\nin agreement with previous disk opacity studies. The vertical scales of stars\nand dust are similar. The clumpy model much better mimics the general\nmorphology in the submm images and the general SED. The inferred gas-to-dust\nmass ratio is compatible with those of similar low-mass disks. The relatively\nlarge radial scale-length of the dust disk points to radial mixing of the dusty\nISM within the stellar disk.

The interaction of their wind with the\nISM produces a bow shock. In late evolutionary stages these stars may undergo\nrapid transitions from red to blue and vice versa on the Hertzsprung-Russell\ndiagram, with accompanying rapid changes to their stellar winds and bow shocks.\nRecent 3D simulations of the bow shock produced by the nearby runaway red\nsupergiant (RSG) Betelgeuse, under the assumption of a constant wind, indicate\nthat the bow shock is very young (<30000 years old), hence Betelgeuse may have\nonly recently become a RSG. To test this possibility, we have calculated\nstellar evolution models for single stars which match the observed properties\nof Betelgeuse in the RSG phase. The resulting evolving stellar wind is\nincorporated into 2D hydrodynamic simulations in which we model a runaway blue\nsupergiant (BSG) as it undergoes the transition to a RSG near the end of its\nlife. We find that the collapsing BSG wind bubble induces a bow shock-shaped\ninner shell around the RSG wind that resembles Betelgeuse's bow shock, and has\na similar mass. Surrounding this is the larger-scale retreating bow shock\ngenerated by the now defunct BSG wind's interaction with the ISM. We suggest\nthat this outer shell could explain the bar feature located (at least in\nprojection) just in front of Betelgeuse's bow shock. \n\n"}

Massive molecular\noutflows have recently been revealed in some AGN hosts. However, the physical\nproperties and structure of these AGN-driven molecular outflows are still\npoorly constrained. Here we present new IRAM PdBI observations of Mrk231, the\nclosest quasar known, targeting both the CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) transitions. We\ndetect broad wings in both transitions, tracing a massive molecular outflow\nwith velocities up to 800 km/s. The wings are spatially resolved at high\nsignificance level (5-11 sigma), indicating that the molecular outflow extends\non the kpc scale. The CO(2-1)/CO(1-0) ratio of the red broad wings is\nconsistent with the ratio observed in the narrow core, while the blue broad\nwing is less excited than the core. The latter result suggests that quasar\ndriven outflow models invoking shocks (which would predict higher gas\nexcitation) are not appropriate to describe the bulk of the outflow in Mrk231.\nHowever, we note that within the central 700 pc the CO(2-1)/CO(1-0) ratio of\nthe red wing is slightly, but significantly, higher than in the line core,\nsuggesting that shocks may play a role in the central region. We also find that\nthe average size of the outflow anticorrelates with the critical density of the\ntransition used as a wind tracer. This indicates that, although diffuse and\ndense clumps coexist in the outflowing gas, dense outflowing clouds have\nshorter lifetime and that they evaporate into the diffuse component along the\noutflow or, more simply, that diffuse clouds are more efficiently accelerated\nto larger distances by radiation pressure. \n\n"}

They claim that their results are at odds\nwith the results from Paranjape & Sheth (2012, PS12) who show that the\nmagnitude distribution of the brightest and second brightest galaxies can be\nexplained based on order statistics of luminosities randomly sampled from the\ntotal galaxy luminosity function. We find that a conditional luminosity\nfunction (CLF) for galaxies which varies with halo mass, in a manner which is\nconsistent with existing observations, naturally leads to a magnitude gap\ndistribution which changes as a function of halo mass at fixed richness, in\nqualitative agreement with H12. We show that, in general, the luminosity\ndistribution of the brightest and the second brightest galaxy depends upon\nwhether the luminosities of galaxies are drawn from the CLF or the global\nluminosity function.

The systems include cooling flow (CF)\nclusters of galaxies, core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), planetary nebulae\n(PNe), and common envelope (CE) evolution. The similarities include hot bubbles\ninflated by jets in a bipolar structure, vortices on the sides of the jets,\nvortices inside the inflated bubbles, fragmentation of bubbles to two and more\nbubbles, and buoyancy of bubbles.

First, we calculate the evolution of such clouds from the\nprestellar stage until long after protostar formation. Then, we calculate the\npolarization of thermal dust emission expected from the simulation data. We\ncreate polarization maps with arbitrary viewing angles and compare them with\nobservations. Using this procedure, we confirmed that the polarization\ndistribution projected on the celestial plane strongly depends on the viewing\nangle of the cloud. Thus, by comparing the observations with the polarization\nmap predicted by the simulations, we can roughly determine the angle between\nthe direction of the global magnetic field and the line of sight.

The aim of this analysis is to look for\nsignatures of discs in light distributions of nearby early-type galaxies and\ncompare them to kinematic properties. Using Sersic index from single component\nfits for a distinction between slow and fast rotators, or even late- and\nearly-type galaxies, is not recommended.

This model can be used to constrain simultaneously the\nform, scatter (including its covariance) and evolution of the scaling\nrelations, as well as the masses of the individual clusters. In this framework,\nscaling relations between observables (such as that between X-ray luminosity\nand temperature) are modelled explicitly in terms of the fundamental\nmass-observable scaling relations, and so are fully constrained without being\nfit directly. We apply the PICACS model to two observational datasets, and show\nthat it performs as well as traditional regression methods for simply measuring\nindividual scaling relation parameters, but reveals additional information on\nthe processes that shape the relations while providing self-consistent mass\nconstraints. Our analysis suggests that the observed combination of slopes of\nthe scaling relations can be described by a deficit of gas in low-mass clusters\nthat is compensated for by elevated gas temperatures, such that the total\nthermal energy of the gas in a cluster of given mass remains close to\nself-similar expectations.

To explain the growth of the\nmagnetic field strength over many orders of magnitude fast amplification\nprocesses need to operate. The most efficient mechanism known today is the\nsmall-scale dynamo, which converts turbulent kinetic energy into magnetic\nenergy leading to an exponential growth of the magnetic field. The efficiency\nof the dynamo depends on the type of turbulence indicated by the slope of the\nturbulence spectrum v(l) \\propto l^{theta}, where v(l) is the eddy velocity at\na scale l. We explore turbulent spectra ranging from incompressible Kolmogorov\nturbulence with theta = 1/3 to highly compressible Burgers turbulence with\ntheta = 1/2. In this work we analyze the properties of the small-scale dynamo\nfor low magnetic Prandtl numbers Pm, which denotes the ratio of the magnetic\nReynolds number, Rm, to the hydrodynamical one, Re. We solve the Kazantsev\nequation, which describes the evolution of the small-scale magnetic field,\nusing the WKB approximation. In the limit of low magnetic Prandtl numbers the\ngrowth rate is proportional to Rm^{(1-theta)/(1+theta)}. We furthermore discuss\nthe critical magnetic Reynolds number Rm_crit, which is required for\nsmall-scale dynamo action. The value of Rm_crit is roughly 100 for Kolmogorov\nturbulence and 2700 for Burgers. Furthermore, we discuss that Rm_crit provides\na stronger constraint in the limit of low Pm than it does for large Pm. We\nconclude that the small-scale dynamo can operate in the regime of low magnetic\nPrandtl numbers, if the magnetic Reynolds number is large enough. Thus, the\nmagnetic field amplification on small scales can take place in a broad range of\nphysical environments and amplify week magnetic seed fields on short\ntimescales. \n\n"}

This issue is especially important for Epoch of\nReionisation (EoR) projects that try to detect the faint redshifted HI signals\nfrom the time of the earliest structures in the Universe.

The fraction of quenched\nsatellites is independent of halo mass and the surrounding large-scale\noverdensity, but increases towards the centres of the haloes, as previously\nfound. The morphological mix is, however, constant with radial position,\nindicating that the well-known morphology-density relation results from the\nincreasing fraction of quenched galaxies towards the centres of haloes. The\nconstancy of the morphological outcome suggests that mass-quenching and\nsatellite quenching have the same effect on the morphologies of the galaxies.\nThe quenched satellites have larger B/T and smaller half-light radii than the\nstar-forming satellites. These are mostly due to differences in the disks. The\nbulges in quenched satellites have very similar luminosities and surface\nbrightness profiles, and any mass growth of the bulges associated with\nquenching cannot greatly change these quantities. The quenched disks are\nfainter and have smaller scale lengths than in star-forming satellites.

A consistent picture is emerging, whereby the\nstar-formation rate density peaked approximately 3.5 Gyr after the Big Bang, at\nz~1.9, and declined exponentially at later times, with an e-folding timescale\nof 3.9 Gyr. Half of the stellar mass observed today was formed before a\nredshift z = 1.3. About 25% formed before the peak of the cosmic star-formation\nrate density, and another 25% formed after z = 0.7.

Active galactic nuclei\n(AGN) jets are expected to drive turbulence and heat cluster cores. Cooling of\nthe intracluster medium (ICM) and stirring by AGN jets are tightly coupled in a\nfeedback loop. We impose the feedback loop by balancing radiative cooling with\nturbulent heating. In addition to heating the plasma, turbulence also mixes it,\nsuppressing the formation of cold gas at small scales. In this regard, the\neffect of turbulence is analogous to thermal conduction. For uniform plasma in\nthermal balance (turbulent heating balancing radiative cooling), cold gas\ncondenses only if the cooling time is shorter than the mixing time. This\ncondition requires the turbulent kinetic energy to be $\\gtrsim$ the plasma\ninternal energy; such high velocities in cool cores are ruled out by\nobservations. The results with realistic magnetic fields and thermal conduction\nare qualitatively similar to the hydrodynamic simulations.

The difference between the\nforward shock emission in a wind-type and a constant-density medium is also\nstudied, and the emission due to Maxwellian electron injection is compared to\nthe case with pure power-law electrons. The code calculates the time-evolving\nphoton and electron distributions in the emission region by solving the\nrelativistic kinetic equations for each particle species. For the first time,\nthe full relativistic equations for synchrotron emission/absorption, Compton\nscattering, and pair production/annihilation were applied to model the forward\nshock emission. The synchrotron self-absorption thermalization mechanism, which\nshapes the low-energy end of the electron distribution, was also included in\nthe electron equation. The simulation results indicate that inverse Compton\nscattering of the prompt GRB photons can produce a luminous TeV emission\ncomponent, even when pair production in the emission region is taken into\naccount. This very high-energy radiation may be observable in low-redshift\nGRBs.

We find that (1) the slope of the stellar\nmetallicity--stellar mass correlation is sensitive to the SN feedback strength\nand the reionization epoch; (2) the extension of the metal-rich tails is mainly\nsensitive to the SN feedback strength; (3) the extension of the metal-poor\ntails is mainly sensitive to the reionization epoch; (4) none of the three\nchemical properties are sensitive to the H$_2$ cooling process; and (5)\ncomparison of our model results with the current observational slope of the\nstellar metallicity--stellar mass relation suggests that the local universe is\nreionized earlier than the cosmic average and local sources may have a\nsignificant contribution to the reionization in the local region, and an\nintermediate to strong SN feedback strength is preferred.

We report the discovery with XMM-Newton of\nan irregular X-ray substructure in the outskirts of the massive galaxy cluster\nAbell 2142. The tip of the X-ray emission coincides with a concentration of\ngalaxies.

The temperature of the gas in this region is 1.4 keV, which is a factor of\n~4 lower than the surrounding medium and is typical of the virialized plasma of\na galaxy group with a mass of a few 10^13M_sun. For this reason, we interpret\nthis structure as a galaxy group in the process of being accreted onto the main\ndark-matter halo.

Physically, as the\nvelocity dispersion and the time delay give a gravitational potential ($GM/r$)\nand a mass ($GM$) of the lens, respectively, dividing them gives a physical\nsize ($r$) of the lens. Comparing the physical size with the image positions of\na lensed galaxy gives the angular diameter distance to the lens. A mismatch\nbetween the exact locations at which these measurements are made can be\ncorrected by measuring a local slope of the mass profile. We expand on the\noriginal idea put forward by Paraficz and Hjorth, who analyzed singular\nisothermal lenses, by allowing for an arbitrary slope of a power-law spherical\nmass density profile, an external convergence, and an anisotropic velocity\ndispersion. We find that the effect of external convergence cancels out when\ndividing the time delays and velocity dispersion measurements.

In radio galaxies, the\nmolecular gas appears to be heated by jet-driven shocks, but exactly how this\nmechanism works is still poorly understood. With Chandra, we observe X-ray\nemission from the jets within the host galaxy and along the 100 kpc radio jets.\nWe model the X-ray spectra of the nucleus, the inner jets, and the X-ray\nfeatures along the extended radio jets. Both the nucleus and the inner jets\nshow evidence of 10^7 K shock-heated gas. The kinetic power of the jets is more\nthan sufficient to heat the X-ray emitting gas within the host galaxy.

Mechanical and radiative feedback Abstract: During the embedded stage of star formation, bipolar molecular outflows and\nUV radiation from the protostar are important feedback processes. Our aim is to\nquantify the feedback, mechanical and radiative, for a large sample of low-mass\nsources. The outflow activity is compared to radiative feedback in the form of\nUV heating by the accreting protostar to search for correlations and\nevolutionary trends. Large-scale maps of 26 young stellar objects, which are\npart of the Herschel WISH key program are obtained using the CHAMP+ instrument\non the APEX (12CO and 13CO 6-5), and the HARP-B instrument on the JCMT (12CO\nand 13CO 3-2). Maps are used to determine outflow parameters and envelope\nmodels are used to quantify the amount of UV-heated gas and its temperature\nfrom 13CO 6-5 observations. All sources in our sample show outflow activity and\nthe outflow force, F_CO, is larger for Class 0 sources than for Class I\nsources, even if their luminosities are comparable. The outflowing gas\ntypically extends to much greater distances than the power-law envelope and\ntherefore influences the surrounding cloud material directly. Comparison of the\nCO 6-5 results with Herschel-HIFI H2O and PACS high-J CO lines, both tracing\ncurrently shocked gas, shows that the two components are linked, even though\nthe transitions do not probe the same gas. The link does not extend down to CO\n3-2. The conclusion is that CO 6-5 depends on the shock characteristics\n(density and velocity), whereas CO 3-2 is more sensitive to conditions in the\nsurrounding environment (density). The radiative feedback is responsible for\nincreasing the gas temperature by a factor of two, up to 30-50 K, on scales of\na few thousand AU, particularly along the direction of the outflow. The mass of\nthe UV heated gas exceeds the mass contained in the entrained outflow in the\ninner ~3000 AU and is therefore at least as important on small scales. \n\n"}

In the past several years, 3D numerical\nsimulations made it possible to compute pulsar spindown luminosity from first\nprinciples and revealed that oblique pulsar winds are more powerful than\naligned ones. However, what causes this enhanced power output of oblique\npulsars is not understood. In this work, using time-dependent 3D\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) and force-free simulations, we show that, contrary to\nthe standard paradigm, the open magnetic flux, which carries the energy away\nfrom the pulsar, is laterally non-uniform. We argue that this non-uniformity is\nthe primary reason for the increased luminosity of oblique pulsars. To\ndemonstrate this, we construct simple analytic descriptions of aligned and\northogonal pulsar winds and combine them to obtain an accurate 3D description\nof the pulsar wind for any obliquity. Our approach describes both the warped\nmagnetospheric current sheet and the smooth variation of pulsar wind properties\noutside of it.

The jump in magnetic field components across\nthe current sheet decreases with increasing obliquity, which could be a\nmechanism that reduces dissipation in near-orthogonal pulsars.

Four of these WLQs can be accommodated by the MBE, but the other\nfive deviate significantly from this relation, at the >~3 \\sigma\\ level, by\nexhibiting C IV lines much weaker than predicted from their Hbeta-based\nEddington ratios. Assuming the supermassive black-hole masses in all quasars\ncan be determined reliably using the single-epoch Hbeta-method, our results\nindicate that EW(C IV) cannot depend solely on the Eddington ratio.

Magnetars are observed as\npeculiar, burst--active X-ray pulsars, the Anomalous X-ray Pulsars (AXPs) and\nthe Soft Gamma Repeaters (SGRs); the latter emitted also three \"giant flares,\"\nextremely powerful events during which luminosities can reach up to 10^47 erg/s\nfor about one second. The last five years have witnessed an explosion in\nmagnetar research which has led, among other things, to the discovery of\ntransient, or \"outbursting,\" and \"low-field\" magnetars.

We present a\nsimulation of single-dish observations including an instrumental noise model\nwith 1/f and white noise, and sky emission with a diffuse Galactic foreground\nand HI emission. We consider two foreground cleaning methods: spectral\nparametric fitting and principal component analysis. For a smooth frequency\nspectrum of the foreground and instrumental effects, we find that the\nparametric fitting method provides residuals that are still contaminated by\nforeground and 1/f noise, but the principal component analysis can remove this\ncontamination down to the thermal noise level. This method is robust for a\nrange of different models of foreground and noise, and so constitutes a\npromising way to recover the HI signal from the data.

The models we adopt\nhere fully take into account velocity anisotropy of tracer stars confined\nwithin a flattened dark halo. Applying our models to the available kinematic\ndata of the 12 bright dSphs, we find that these galaxies associate with, in\ngeneral, elongated dark halos, even considering the effect of this velocity\nanisotropy of stars.

A suppression in\nthe flux of UHECRs at energies above 40 EeV -- as expected from both these\ninteractions -- has been established experimentally beyond any doubt by current\nexperiments. However, such an observation is still not conclusive on the origin\nof the suppression.

We show that\nthe frequency peaks of the post-merger gravitational wave signal are in good\nagreement with predictions obtained from simulations using a simpler treatment\nof gravity. We find, however, that only the fundamental mode of the remnant is\nexcited for long periods of time: emission at the secondary peaks is damped on\na millisecond timescale in the simulated binaries. For such low-mass systems,\nthe remnant is a massive neutron star which, depending on the equation of\nstate, is either permanently stable or long-lived. We observe strong\nexcitations of l=2, m=2 modes, both in the massive neutron star and in the form\nof hot, shocked tidal arms in the surrounding accretion torus. We estimate the\nneutrino emission of the remnant using a neutrino leakage scheme and, in one\ncase, compare these results with a gray two-moment neutrino transport scheme.\nWe confirm the complex geometry of the neutrino emission, also observed in\nprevious simulations with neutrino leakage, and show explicitly the presence of\nimportant differences in the neutrino luminosity, disk composition, and outflow\nproperties between the neutrino leakage and transport schemes. \n\n"}

Here we explore the non-trivial coupling between these two\nprocesses and analyze how the global properties of externally supplied\ncircumbinary disks depend on the binary accretion rate. By formulating our\nresults in terms of the angular momentum flux driven by internal stresses, we\ncome up with a very simple classification of the possible global disk\nstructures, which differ from the standard constant $\\dot M$ accretion disk\nsolution. Suppression of accretion by the binary tides, leading to a\nsignificant mass accumulation in the inner disk, accelerates binary inspiral.\nWe show that once the disk region strongly perturbed by the viscously\ntransmitted tidal torque exceeds the binary semi-major axis, the binary can\nmerge in less than its mass-doubling time due to accretion.

Outside our\nneighbourhood, all the information we have on SMBHs is derived from quasars and\nAGN, giving us a partial view. We study the evolution of the SMBH population,\ntotal and active, by the continuity equation, backwards in time from z=0 to\nz=4. Type-1 and type-2 AGN are differentiated in the model on the basis of the\nEddington ratio distribution, chosen on the basis of observational estimates.\nThe duty cycle is obtained by matching the luminosity function of quasars, and\nthe average radiative efficiency is the only free parameter in the model. For\nhigher radiative efficiencies (>~0.07) a large fraction of the SMBH population,\nmost of them quiescent, must already be in place by z=4. For lower radiative\nefficiencies (~0.05), the duty cycle increases with the redshift and the SMBH\npopulation evolves dramatically since z=4. The mass function of active SMBHs\ndoes not depend on the choice of the radiative efficiency or of the local SMBH\nmass function, but it is mainly determined by the quasar luminosity function,\nonce the Eddington ratio distribution is fixed.

We therefore investigate the rotation curves in BCDs formed from\nmergers between gas-rich dwarf irregular galaxies based on the results of\nnumerical simulations for BCD formation. The principal results are as follows.\nThe dark matter of merging dwarf irregulars undergoes a central concentration\nso that the central density can become up to six times higher than those of the\ninitial dwarf irregulars. However, the more compact dark matter halo alone can\nnot reproduce the gradient differences observed between dwarf irregulars and\nBCDs. We provide further support that the central concentration of gas due to\nrapid gas-transfer to the central regions of dwarf--dwarf mergers is\nresponsible for the observed difference in rotation curve gradients. The BCDs\nwith central gas concentration formed from merging can thus show steeply rising\nrotation curves in their central regions.

In this\npaper we investigate the bright and extended SiO(2-1) emission observed along\nthe ~5 pc-long W43-MM1 ridge to determine its origin.

From a\ntheoretical point of view, supersonic turbulence has been the subject of\ninterest in many analytical theories proposing a strong correlation with the\ncharacteristic mass of the core mass function (CMF) in star forming regions,\nand as a consequence with the stellar IMF. Performing two suites of smoothed\nparticles hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations with different mass resolutions, we\naim at testing the effects of variations in the turbulent properties of a\ndense, star forming molecular cloud on the shape of the system mass function in\ndifferent density regimes. While analytical theories predict a shift of the\npeak of the CMF towards lower masses with increasing velocity dispersion of the\ncloud, we observe in the low-density regime the opposite trend, with high Mach\nnumbers giving rise to a top-heavy mass distribution.

We show that instantaneous\nmasses and maximum circular velocities of individual subhaloes are extremely\nnoisy, despite the use of a sophisticated, phase-space-based halo finder.

The frequency-dependent extension of the\nradio-emitting wind is around ~ 3 to 30 Rstar for frequencies in the range of\n275 to 50MHz, implying that V830 Tau b, at an orbital distance of 6.1 Rstar,\ncould be embedded in the regions of the host star's wind that are optically\nthick to radio wavelengths, but not deeply so. Planetary emission can only\npropagate in the stellar wind plasma if the frequency of the cyclotron emission\nexceeds the stellar wind plasma frequency. For that, we find that for planetary\nradio emission to propagate through the host star wind, planetary magnetic\nfield strengths larger than ~1.3 to 13 G are required. The V830 Tau system is a\nvery interesting system for conducting radio observations from both the\nperspective of radio emission from the planet as well as from the host star's\nwind. \n\n"}

Because the $Z'$ is\nanomalous, these kinds of DM models can be realized only as effective field\ntheories (EFTs) with a well-defined cutoff, where heavy spectator fermions\nrestore gauge invariance at high energies. We formulate these EFTs, estimate\ntheir cutoff and properly take into account the effect of the Chern-Simons\nterms one obtains after the spectator fermions are integrated out.

We present a mechanism\nthat causes such a spin-orbit misalignment for a protoplanetary disc due to its\nmovement through an ambient medium. Our physical explanation of the mechanism\nis based on the theoretical solutions to the Stark problem. We test this idea\nby performing self-consistent hydrodynamical simulations and simplified\ngravitational $N$-body simulations. The $N$-body model reduces the mechanism to\nthe relevant physical processes. The hydrodynamical simulations show the\nmechanism in its full extent, including gas-dynamical and viscous processes in\nthe disc which are not included in the theoretical framework. We find that a\nprotoplanetary disc embedded in a flow changes its orientation as its angular\nmomentum vector tends to align parallel to the relative velocity vector. Due to\nthe force exerted by the flow, orbits in the disc become eccentric, which\nproduces a net torque and consequentially changes the orbital inclination. The\ntilting of the disc causes it to contract. Apart from becoming lopsided, the\ngaseous disc also forms a spiral arm even if the inclination does not change\nsubstantially. The process is most effective at high velocities and\nobservational signatures are therefore mostly expected in massive star-forming\nregions and around winds or supernova ejecta.

Despite much theoretical/numerical and experimental\nefforts over the last decades, its saturation mechanism and amplitude, which\nsets the angular momentum transport rate, remains not well understood,\nespecially in the limit of high resistivity, or small magnetic Prandtl numbers\ntypical to interiors (dead zones) of protoplanetary disks, liquid cores of\nplanets and liquid metals in laboratory.

For simplicity, the ratio of azimuthal field to axial field is\nkept fixed.

We show that this parameter is also important in the\nnonlinear problem. By increasing its value, a sudden transition from weakly\nnonlinear, where the system is slightly above the linear stability threshold,\nto strongly nonlinear, or turbulent regime occurs. We calculate the azimuthal\nand axial energy spectra corresponding to these two regimes and show that they\ndiffer qualitatively. Remarkably, the nonlinear state remains in all cases\nnearly axisymmetric suggesting that HMRI turbulence is quasi two-dimensional in\nnature.

The total far-infrared (FIR) luminosity is key for this analysis but\npoorly constrained in normal (main-sequence) star-forming z > 5 galaxies where\noften only one single FIR point is available. To better inform estimates of the\nFIR luminosity, we construct a sample of local galaxies and three low-redshift\nanalogs of z > 5 systems. The trends in this sample suggest that normal\nhigh-redshift galaxies have a warmer infrared (IR) SED compared to average z <\n4 galaxies that are used as prior in these studies. The blue-shifted peak and\nmid-IR excess emission could be explained by a combination of a larger fraction\nof the metal-poor inter-stellar medium (ISM) being optically thin to\nultra-violet (UV) light and a stronger UV radiation field due to high star\nformation densities.

Comparing the\noutcomes of our simulations to observations, we find that simulations remaining\nclose to virial balance throughout their history produce star formation\nefficiencies and initial mass function (IMF) peaks that are stable in time and\nin reasonable agreement with observations. Our results indicate that\nsmall-scale dissipation effects near the protostellar surface provide a\nfeedback loop for stabilizing the star formation efficiency. This is true\nregardless of whether the balance is maintained by input of energy from large\nscale forcing or by strong magnetic fields that inhibit collapse.

The model has no free parameters and is\ntherefore extremely predictive; moreover, recent studies singled out a Majorana\n$SU(2)_\\text{L}$ quintuplet as the only viable candidate.

Classically, polarization\nis expected from non-spherical grains aligned with the magnetic field.\nRecently, two alternatives have been suggested. One polarization mechanism is\ncaused by self-scattering from dust grains of sizes comparable to the\nwavelength while the other mechanism is due to grains aligned with their short\naxes along the direction of radiation anisotropy. The latter has recently been\nshown as a likely mechanism for causing the dust polarization detected in HL\nTau at 3.1 mm. In this paper, we present ALMA polarization observations of HL\nTau for two more wavelengths: 870 $\\mu$m and 1.3 mm. The morphology at 870\n$\\mu$m matches the expectation for self-scattering, while that at 1.3 mm shows\na mix between self-scattering and grains aligned with the radiation anisotropy.\nThe observations cast doubt on the ability of (sub)millimeter continuum\npolarization to probe disk magnetic fields for at least HL Tau. By showing two\ndistinct polarization morphologies at 870 $\\mu$m and 3.1 mm and a transition\nbetween the two at 1.3 mm, this paper provides definitive evidence that the\ndominant (sub)millimeter polarization mechanism transitions with wavelength.

However, it\nis also known that the non-attractor inflation by itself is incomplete and\nshould be followed by a phase of slow-roll attractor. Moreover, there is a\ntransition process between these two phases. In the past literature, this\ntransition was approximated as instant and the evolution of non-Gaussianity in\nthis phase was not fully studied. In this paper, we follow the detailed\nevolution of the non-Gaussianity through the transition phase into the\nslow-roll attractor phase, considering different types of transition. We find\nthat the transition process has important effect on the size of the local\nnon-Gaussianity. We first compute the net contribution of the non-Gaussianities\nat the end of inflation in canonical non-attractor models. If the curvature\nperturbations keep evolving during the transition - such as in the case of\nsmooth transition or some sharp transition scenarios - the $\\mathcal{O}(1)$\nlocal non-Gaussianity generated in the non-attractor phase can be completely\nerased by the subsequent evolution, although the consistency relation remains\nviolated. In extremal cases of sharp transition where the super-horizon modes\nfreeze immediately right after the end of the non-attractor phase, the original\nnon-attractor result can be recovered. We also study models with non-canonical\nkinetic terms, and find that the transition can typically contribute a\nsuppression factor in the squeezed bispectrum, but the final local\nnon-Gaussianity can still be made parametrically large. \n\n"}

The presence of the hot and low-density shell can\nbe used as an ancillary indicator for a high rate of energy release during the\noutburst, which is required to drive strong shocks into the gas.

The presence of the majority of these species\ncan be explained by shock-induced non-TE chemical models, where shocks caused\nby the pulsating star take the chemistry out of TE in the inner region.\nMoreover, a non-uniform density structure has been detected in several AGB\noutflows. A detailed parameter study on the quantitative effects of a\nnon-homogeneous outflow has so far not been performed. We implement a porosity\nformalism for treating the increased leakage of light associated with radiation\ntransport through a clumpy, porous medium. The effects from the altered UV\nradiation field penetration on the chemistry, accounting also for the increased\nreaction rates of two-body processes in the overdense clumps, are examined. We\npresent a parameter study of the effect of clumping and porosity on the\nchemistry throughout the outflow. Both the higher density within the clumps and\nthe increased UV radiation field penetration have an important impact on the\nchemistry, as they both alter the chemical pathways. The increased amount of UV\nradiation in the inner region leads to photodissociation of parent species,\nreleasing the otherwise deficient elements. We find an increased abundance in\nthe inner region of all species not expected to be present assuming TE\nchemistry, such as HCN in O-rich outflows, H$_2$O in C-rich outflows, and\nNH$_3$ in both. Outflows whose clumps have a large overdensity and that are\nvery porous to the interstellar UV radiation field yield abundances comparable\nto those observed in O- and C-rich outflows for most of the unexpected species\ninvestigated. The inner wind abundances of H$_2$O in C-rich outflows and of\nNH$_3$ in O- and C-rich outflows are however underpredicted. \n\n"}

VANDELS' main targets are star-forming galaxies at\n2.4<z<5.5 and massive passive galaxies at 1<z<2.5. By adopting a strategy of\nultra-long exposure times, from 20 to 80 hours per source, VANDELS is designed\nto be the deepest ever spectroscopic survey of the high-redshift Universe.\nExploiting the red sensitivity of the VIMOS spectrograph, the survey has\nobtained ultra-deep spectra covering the wavelength 4800-10000 A with\nsufficient signal-to-noise to investigate the astrophysics of high-redshift\ngalaxy evolution via detailed absorption line studies. The VANDELS-DR1 is the\nrelease of all spectra obtained during the first season of observations and\nincludes data for galaxies for which the total (or half of the total) scheduled\nintegration time was completed. The release contains 879 individual objects\nwith a measured redshift and includes fully wavelength and flux-calibrated 1D\nspectra, the associated error spectra, sky spectra and wavelength-calibrated 2D\nspectra. We also provide a catalog with the essential galaxy parameters,\nincluding spectroscopic redshifts and redshift quality flags.

By uplifting cool gas from the center of the\ncluster jets and the bubbles they inflate cause the direction of later jets to\nsubstantially change. Some uplifted cool clumps fall back to feed the active\ngalactic nucleus, in what is termed the cold feedback mechanism, but with an\naverage angular momentum that is largely inclined to that of the original jets.\nThe proposed jittering jets scenario allows, over the cooling time of the\nintracluster medium (ICM), the heating by the mixing of hot jet-inflated bubble\ngas with the ICM to operate in all directions. The proposed scenario further\nsupports the heating by mixing mechanism of the ICM. The feedback heating\nmechanism of the ICM chiefly refers to the energy cycle. The cold feedback\nmechanism introduces mass as another ingredient of the feedback cycle, as the\nmass accretion of future activity cycles is determined by the formation of\nperturbations by the present activity cycle. The jittering jets scenario that I\npropose here brings angular momentum to be another ingredient of the feedback\ncycle. \n\n"}

Abstract: Short gamma-ray bursts may originate from the merger of double neutron stars\n(NS) or that of a black hole (BH) and an NS. We propose that the bright X-ray\nflare related to the central engine reactivity may hint a BH-NS merger, since\nsuch a merger can provide more fall-back materials and therefore a more massive\naccretion disk than the NS-NS merger. Based on the observed 49 short bursts\nwith Swift/X-ray Telescope follow-up observations, we find that three bursts\nhave bright X-ray flares, among which three flares from two bursts are probably\nrelated to the central engine reactivity. We argue that these two bursts may\noriginate from the BH-NS merger rather than the NS-NS merger.

We supplement the astrometric data with radial velocities\ncollected from a dozen literature sources. By assuming that all cluster members\nmove with the mean cluster velocity to within the velocity dispersion, we use\nthe observed and the expected motions of the stars to determine individual\ncluster membership probabilities. We subsequently derive improved parallaxes\nthrough maximum-likelihood kinematic modelling of the cluster.

This so-called \"neutrino floor\" may\nsignificantly reduce the sensitivity of an experiment to DM-nuclei\ninteractions, particularly if the recoil spectrum of the neutrino background is\napproximately degenerate with the DM signal. This occurs for the conventionally\nconsidered spin-independent (SI) or spin-dependent (SD) interactions. In such\ncase, an increase in the experiment's exposure by multiple orders of magnitude\nmay not yield any significant increase in sensitivity. The typically considered\nSI and SD interactions, however, do not adequately reflect the whole landscape\nof the well-motivated DM models, which includes other interactions. Since\nparticle DM has not been detected yet in laboratories, it is essential to\nunderstand and maximize the detection capabilities for a broad variety of\npossible models and signatures.

In this regime, foreground contamination to the temperature map\nproduces significant lensing biases, which cannot be fully controlled by\nmulti-frequency component separation, masking or bias hardening. In this\nletter, we split the standard CMB lensing quadratic estimator into a new set of\noptimal \"multipole\" estimators. On large scales, these multipole estimators\nreduce to the known magnification and shear estimators, and a new shear B-mode\nestimator. We leverage the different symmetries of the lensed CMB and\nextragalactic foregrounds to argue that the shear-only estimator should be\napproximately immune to extragalactic foregrounds. We build a new method to\ncompute separately and without noise the primary, secondary and trispectrum\nbiases to CMB lensing from foreground simulations. Using this method, we\ndemonstrate that the shear estimator is indeed insensitive to extragalactic\nforegrounds, even when applied to a single-frequency temperature map\ncontaminated with CIB, tSZ, kSZ and radio point sources. This dramatic\nreduction in foreground biases allows us to include higher temperature\nmultipoles than with the standard quadratic estimator, thus increasing the\ntotal lensing signal-to-noise beyond the quadratic estimator.

We show that a possible\nsignature of the Standard Model Higgs instability is the production of\ngravitational waves sourced by Higgs fluctuations generated during inflation.\nWe fully characterise the two-point correlator of such gravitational waves by\ncomputing its amplitude, the frequency at peak, the spectral index, as well as\ntheir three-point correlators for various polarisations. We show that,\ndepending on the Higgs and top masses, either LISA or the Einstein Telescope\nand Advanced-Ligo, could detect such stochastic background of gravitational\nwaves. In this sense, collider and gravitational wave physics can provide\nfundamental and complementary informations. Furthermore, the consistency\nrelation among the three- and the two-point correlators could provide an\nefficient tool to ascribe the detected gravitational waves to the Standard\nModel itself.

In this paper, we demonstrate\nthat, in addition to neutrino masses and dark matter, the scotogenic model also\nallows to explain the baryon asymmetry of the Universe via low-scale\nleptogenesis. First, we consider the case of two right-handed neutrinos (RHNs)\nN_{1,2}, for which we provide an analytical argument why it is impossible to\npush the RHN mass scale below M_1^min ~ 10^10 GeV, which is identical to the\nvalue in standard thermal leptogenesis in the type-I seesaw scenario with the\nsame washout strength. Then, we present a detailed study of the three-RHN case\nbased on both an analytical and a numerical analysis. In the case of three\nRHNs, we obtain a lower bound on the N_1 mass of around 10 TeV. Remarkably\nenough, successful low-scale leptogenesis can be achieved without any\ndegeneracy in the RHN mass spectrum. The only necessary condition is a\nsuppression in the N_1 Yukawa couplings, which results in suppressed washout\nand a small active neutrino mass of around 10^-12 eV.

This has led to a perceived dearth of dusty\nsystems at $z>4$, and the conclusion, according to some models, that the early\nUniverse was relatively dust-poor. In this paper, we extend the backward\nevolution galaxy model described by Casey et al.

Second, unlike the planets themselves, the\nTNOs do not orbit on coplanar, circular orbits around the Sun, but move mostly\non inclined, eccentric orbits and are distributed in a complex way. This\nimplies that some process restructured the outer solar system after its\nformation. However, some of TNOs, referred to as Sednoids, move outside the\nzone of influence of the planets. Thus external forces must have played an\nimportant part in the restructuring of the outer solar system. The study\npresented here shows that a close fly-by of a neighbouring star can\nsimultaneously lead to the observed lower mass density outside 30 AU and excite\nthe TNOs onto eccentric, inclined orbits, including the family of Sednoids. In\nthe past it was estimated that such close fly-bys are rare during the relevant\ndevelopment stage.

Then the BLR is spread over many isodelay surfaces,\nyielding a smeared and structured echo as observed. Furthermore, if the BLR\nclouds shield the bottom of the bowl rim against radiation from the nucleus,\nthe hot dust emission comes essentially from the top edge of the bowl (40 deg <\ntheta < 45 deg). Then, for small inclinations as for 3C120, the top dust edge\nforms a ring which largely coincides with a narrow range of isodelay surfaces,\nyielding the observed sharp dust echo. The scale height of the BLR increases\nwith radial distance from the black hole. This leads to luminosity dependent\nforeshortening effects of the lag. We discuss implications and possible\ncorrections of the foreshortening for the black hole mass determination and\nconsequences for the lag (size) - luminosity relationships and the difference\nto interferometric torus sizes. \n\n"}

Multiband observations of the optical\ntransient have identified brightness and spectrum features broadly consistent\nwith theoretical predictions. According to the theoretical model, the optical\nradiation from a neutron star merger originates from the radioactive decay of\nunstable nuclides freshly synthesized in the merger ejecta. In about a day the\nejecta transits from an optically thick state to an optically thin state due to\nits subrelativistic expansion. Hence, we expect that about a day after the\nmerger, the gamma-ray photons produced by radioactive decays start to escape\nfrom the ejecta and make it bright in the MeV band. In this paper, we study the\nfeatures of the radioactive gamma-ray emission from a neutron star merger,\nincluding the brightness and the spectrum, and discuss the observability of the\ngamma-ray emission. We find that more than $95\\%$ of the radiated gamma-ray\nenergy is carried by photons of $0.2$-$4$ MeV, with a spectrum shaped by the\nnucleosynthesis process and the subrelativistic expansion of the ejecta.

After\nclassifying all possible contact terms in de Sitter space, we derive an\nanalytic expression for the four-point function of conformally coupled scalars\nmediated by the tree-level exchange of massive scalars. Conformal symmetry\nimplies that the correlator satisfies a pair of differential equations with\nrespect to spatial momenta, encoding bulk time evolution in purely boundary\nterms. The absence of unphysical singularities completely fixes this\ncorrelator. A spin-raising operator relates it to the correlators associated\nwith the exchange of particles with spin, while weight-shifting operators map\nit to the four-point function of massless scalars.

We evaluate the importance of 56Ni in shaping light curves of\nSNe IIP by simulating light curves for two red supergiant models using\ndifferent amounts of 56Ni and with different types of mixing: uniform\ndistribution of 56Ni out to different fractions of the envelope and \"boxcar\"\ndistribution of 56Ni. We find, similarly to previous studies, that 56Ni extends\nduration of the plateau. We find a formula to estimate the extension based on\nthe observed bolometric light curves and show that for most SNe IIP 56Ni\nextends the plateau by about 20%. Another effect of 56Ni consists in reduction\nof the plateau decline rate, i.e. 56Ni presented in the ejecta flattens the\nplateau. Our simulations suggest that for typical SNe IIP it can reduce the\ndecline rate by about 1 mag/100 day.

Thus, all low-frequency ion\nheating in such plasmas is due to compressive fluctuations (\"slow modes\").\nBecause these fluctuations energetically decouple from the Alfv\\'enic ones\nalready in the inertial range, the above conclusion means that the energy\npartition between ions and electrons in low-beta plasmas is decided at the\nouter scale, where turbulence is launched, and can be determined from\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models of the relevant astrophysical systems. Any\nadditional ion heating must come from non-gyrokinetic mechanisms such as\ncyclotron heating or the stochastic heating owing to distortions of ions'\nLarmor orbits. An exception to these conclusions occurs in the Hall limit,\ni.e., when the ratio of the ion to electron temperatures is as low as the ion\nbeta (equivalently, the electron beta is order unity). In this regime, slow\nmodes couple to Alfv\\'enic ones well above the Larmor scale (viz., at the ion\ninertial or ion sound scale), so the Alfv\\'enic and compressive cascades join\nand then separate again into two cascades of fluctuations that linearly\nresemble kinetic Alfv\\'en and ion cyclotron waves, with the former heating\nelectrons and the latter ions.

The similarity, in\nspite the differences in the physical parameters between the Galaxy and the\nSMC, suggests that the shape of the power spectra reflects some underlying\nmechanism which is not too sensitive to the environmental specifics. In this\npaper we present an interpretation for the observational power spectra in terms\nof a large scale turbulence in the interstellar medium, in which the emitting\nH$_I$ regions are embedded. The turbulence gives rise to density fluctuations\nwhich lead to the observed intensity fluctuations, in the H$_I$ regions. The\nobservational power spectra are used to deduce the turbulence spectral\nfunction.\n  In the SMC, the turbulence largest eddies are comparable in scale to the SMC\nitself. This implies that turbulent mixing should have smoothed out any large\nscale abundance gradients. Indeed, this seems to be the case, observationally.\n  The turbulence is also expected to amplify and shape up the large scale\nmagnetic field. Indeed, the observational data indicate the existence of a\nlarge scale disordered field of the strength expected from energy equilibrium\nwith the turbulent velocity field. The large scale turbulence is most probably\ngenerated by instabilities in the large scale flows induced by the tidal close\nencounter with the LMC $ \\sim 2\\times 10^8{\\rm yr}$ ago. The life-time of the\nlargest eddies is $\\sim 4\\times 10^8{\\rm yr}$ so the turbulence had not yet\nenough time to decay and persists even though the energy source is no longer\nthere. \n\n"}

Observational upper limits on the 16.4 um and 20 um features\nin NGC 2023 impose upper limits of < 1.5 ppm in pure Si SNPs, and or < 0.2 ppm\nin Si/SiO2 SNPs. The observed ERE intensity from NGC 2023 then gives a lower\nbound on the required photoluminescence efficiency eta. For foreground\nextinction A(0.68um) = 1.2, we find eta > 5% for Si SNPs, or eta > 24% for\nSi/SiO2 SNPs in NGC 2023.

We model the IR emission with our\npopulation synthesis code, GRASIL (Silva et al. 1998). As for the radio\nemission, we revisit the simple model of Condon & Yin (1990). We find that a\ntightFIR/Radio correlation is natural when the synchrotron mechanism dominates\nover the inverse Compton, and the electrons cooling time is shorter than the\nfading time of the supernova rate. Observations indicate that both these\nconditions are met in star forming galaxies. However since the radio non\nthermal emission is delayed, deviations are expected both in the early phases\nof a starburst, when the radio thermal component dominates, and in the\npost-starburst phase, when the bulk of the NT component originates from less\nmassive stars. This delay allows the analysis of obscured starbursts with a\ntime resolution of a few tens of Myrs, unreachable with other star formation\nindicators. We suggest to complement the analysis of the deviations from the\nFIR/Radio correlation with the radio slope to obtain characteristic parameters\nof the burst. The analysis of a sample of compact ULIRGs shows that they are\nintense but transient starbursts, to which one should not apply usual SF\nindicators devised for constant SF rates. We also discuss the possibility of\nusing the q- radio slope diagram to asses the presence of obscured AGN.

A total of 230 observations amounts to a net exposure of\n845ksec, with this spectral and variability analysis of 3C273 covering the\nlongest observation period available at hard X-ray energies. Flux variations by\na factor of 4 have been detected over 4years, whereas less than 30% flux\nvariations have been observed for individual flares on time-scales of 3 days.\nTwo temporal methods, the power spectrum density (PSD) and the structure\nfunction (SF), have been used to study the variability characteristics of\n3C273. The hard X-ray photon spectra generally show a power-law shape with a\ndifferential photon index of G = 1.6+-0.1.

N63A, one of the brightest LMC remnants, is\nembedded in an H II region and probably associated with an OB association. The\noptical remnant consists of three lobes of emission contained within the\napproximately three times larger X-ray remnant. Our Chandra data reveal a\nnumber of new physical structures in N63A. The most striking of these are the\nseveral ``crescent''-shaped structures located beyond the main shell that\nresemble similar features seen in the Vela SNR. In Vela, these have been\ninterpreted as arising from high speed clumps of supernova ejecta interacting\nwith the ambient medium. Another distinct feature of the remnant is a roughly\ntriangular ``hole'' in the X-ray emission near the location of the optical\nlobes and the brightest radio emission. X-ray spectral analysis shows that this\ndeficit of emission is a result of absorption by an intervening dense cloud\nwith a mass of ~450 M_sun that is currently being engulfed by the remnant's\nblast wave.

The magnitude of the deviation is delta_p\ne_p rho_p^{-1/2}, where e_p is the fraction of starlight reflected by the\nplanet and rho_p is the angular radius of the planet in units of angular\nEinstein ring radius.

We solve the\nradial momentum equation for solutions corresponding to an accretion flow that\nstarts from a subsonic state at infinity, smoothly passes the fast critical\npoint, then supersonically falls into the horizon of the black hole. The\nsolutions always have the following features: 1) The specific energy of fluid\nparticles remains constant but the specific angular momentum is effectively\nremoved by the magnetic field. 2) At large radii, where the disk motion is\ndominantly rotational, the energy density of the magnetic field is\nequipartitioned with the rotational energy density of the disk. 3) Inside the\nfast critical point, where radial motion becomes important, the ratio of the\nelectromagnetic energy density to the kinetic energy density drops quickly. The\nresults indicate that: 1) Disk accretion does not necessarily imply energy\ndissipation since magnetic fields do not have to transport or dissipate a lot\nof energy as they effectively transport angular momentum. 2) When resistivity\nis small, the large-scale magnetic field is amplified by the shearing rotation\nof the disk until the magnetic energy density is equipartitioned with the\nrotational energy density, ending up with a geometrically thick disk. This is\nin contrast with the evolution of small-scale magnetic fields where if the\nresistivity is nonzero the magnetic energy density is likely to be\nequipartitioned with the kinetic energy density associated with local random\nmotions (e.g., turbulence), making a thin Keplerian disk possible. \n\n"}

Our approach is\nunderpinned by a large ensemble of mock galaxy catalogues constructed from the\nHubble Volume N-body simulations.

On large\nscales, our measurement of the power spectrum is consistent with the shape of\nthe mass power spectrum in the popular ``concordance'' cold dark matter model.\nThe galaxy power spectrum on small scales is strongly affected by nonlinear\nevolution of density fluctuations, and, to a lesser degree, by galaxy bias.

In\nthis paper we examine the accuracy of the PSF anisotropy correction using\nimages of fields with a large number of stars. The ellipticity correlation\nfunction of the residuals is studied to quantify the effect of imperfect\ncorrections for PSF anisotropy on cosmic shear studies. These imperfections\noccur on the chip scale and consequently the systematic signal decreases\nrapidly with increasing angular scale. Separation of the signal into ``E''\n(curl-free) and ``B'' (curl) components can help to identify the presence of\nresidual systematics, but in general, the amplitude of the ``B''-mode is\ndifferent from that of the ``E''-mode. The study of fields with many stars can\nbe beneficial in finding a proper description of the variation of PSF\nanisotropy, and consequently help to significantly improve the accuracy with\nwhich the cosmic shear signal can be measured. We show that with such an\napproach it is feasible that the accuracy of future cosmic shear studies is\nlimited by the statistical noise introduced by the intrinsic shapes of the\nsources. In particular, the prospects for accurate measurements of the cosmic\nshear signal on scales larger than ~10 arcminutes are excellent. \n\n"}

This is the first time that this quasar is observed in the hard\nX-ray range (above 2 keV).

HETE-2 has\nalso provided strong evidence that the properties of X-Ray Flashes (XRFs) and\nGRBs form a continuum, and therefore that these two types of bursts are the\nsame phenomenon. We show that both the structured jet and the uniform jet\nmodels can explain the observed properties of GRBs reasonably well. However, if\none tries to account for the properties of both XRFs and GRBs in a unified\npicture, the uniform jet model works reasonably well while the structured jet\nmodel fails utterly. The uniform jet model of XRFs and GRBs implies that most\nGRBs have very small jet opening angles (~ half a degree). This suggests that\nmagnetic fields play a crucial role in GRB jets. The model also implies that\nthe energy radiated in gamma rays is ~100 times smaller than has been thought.\nMost importantly, the model implies that there are ~10^4 -10^5 more bursts with\nvery small jet opening angles for every such burst we see. Thus the rate of\nGRBs could be comparable to the rate of Type Ic core collapse supernovae.\nAccurate, rapid localizations of many XRFs, leading to identification of their\nX-ray and optical afterglows and the determination of their redshifts, will be\nrequired in order to confirm or rule out these profound implications.

There is accumulating evidence that the H beta profile is dominated by\ngravity, and thus provides a useful estimate of the black hole mass in AGN. The\nshift and asymmetry commonly seen in C IV suggest that non gravitational\neffects, such as obscuration and radiation pressure, may affect the line\nprofile.

(2) In most objects where the H beta FWHM <4000 km/s the C IV line is\nbroader than H beta, but the reverse is true when the H beta FWHM > 4000 km/s.\nThis argues against the view that C IV generally originates closer to the\ncenter, compared to H beta.\n  (3) C IV appears to provide a significantly less accurate, and possibly\nbiased estimate of the black hole mass in AGN, compared with H beta.

In order to examine to what extent the simulated MHD flows can account\nfor the observed spectral energy distribution (SED) of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*),\nfor the first time we calculate the emergent spectra from 3D MHD flows in a\nwide range of wavelengths (from radio to X-ray) by solving the 3D radiative\ntransfer equations.

We assume two\ntemperature plasmas and calculate electron temperatures by solving the electron\nenergy equation. Only thermal electrons are considered.

The stellar and\nionized gas morphology shows lambda-dependent variations due to the combined\neffects of the dust internal extinction, and the nature and spatial\ndistribution of the different ionizing sources. The two-dimensional ionization\nmaps have revealed an off-nuclear conical structure of about 4 kpc in length,\ncharacterized by high excitation conditions and a radial gradient in the gas\nelectron density. The apex of this structure coincides with B1 region of\nNGC3690 which, in turn, presents Seyfert-like ionization, high extinction and a\nhigh velocity dispersion. These results strongly support the hypothesis that B1\nis the true nucleus of NGC3690, where an AGN is located. In the circumnuclear\nregions HII-like ionization dominates, while LINER-like ionization is found\nelsewhere. The Halpha emitting sources with ages from 3.3 to 7.2x10^6 years,\nhave masses of between 6 and 680x10^6 Msun and contribute (extinction\ncorrected) about 45% to the bolometric luminosity.

The Luminosity Function of Globular\n  Clusters in Early Type Galaxies Abstract: We analyze the luminosity function of the globular clusters (GCs) belonging\nto the early-type galaxies observed in the ACS Virgo Cluster Survey. We have\nobtained estimates for a Gaussian representation of the GC luminosity function\n(GCLF) for 89 galaxies. We have also fit the GCLFs with an \"evolved Schechter\nfunction\", which is meant to reflect the preferential depletion of low-mass\nGCs, primarily by evaporation due to two-body relaxation, from an initial\nSchechter mass function similar to that of young massive clusters. We find a\nsignificant trend of the GCLF dispersion with galaxy luminosity, in the sense\nthat smaller galaxies have narrower GCLFs. We show that this narrowing of the\nGCLF in a Gaussian description is driven by a steepening of the GC mass\nfunction above the turnover mass, as one moves to smaller host galaxies. We\nargue that this behavior at the high-mass end of the GC mass function is most\nlikely a consequence of systematic variations of the initial cluster mass\nfunction. The GCLF turnover mass M_TO is roughly constant, at ~ 2.2 x 10^5\nM_sun in bright galaxies, but it decreases slightly in dwarfs with M_B >~ -18.\nWe show that part of the variation could arise from the shorter dynamical\nfriction timescales in smaller galaxies. We probe the variation of the GCLF to\nprojected galactocentric radii of 20-35 kpc in the Virgo giants M49 and M87,\nfinding that M_TO is essentially constant over these spatial scales. Our fits\nof evolved Schechter functions imply average dynamical mass losses (Delta) over\na Hubble time that fall in the range 2 x 10^5 <~ (Delta/M_sun) < 10^6 per GC.\nWe agree with previous suggestions that if the full GCLF is to be understood in\nmore detail GCLF models will have to include self-consistent treatments of\ndynamical evolution inside time-dependent galaxy potentials.

Shell positions and dust characteristics are\ninferred from model galaxy subtracted images. RESULT: The ACS images reveal\nshells well within the effective radius in some galaxies (at 1.7 kpc in the\ncase of NGC 5982). In some cases, strong nuclear dust patches prevent detection\nof inner shells. Most shells have colours which are similar to the underlying\ngalaxy. Some inner shells are redder than the galaxy. All six shell galaxies\nshow out of dynamical equilibrium dust features, like lanes or patches, in\ntheir central regions. Our detection rate for dust in the shell ellipticals is\ngreater than that found from HST archive data for a sample of normal early-type\ngalaxies, at the 95% confidence level. CONCLUSIONS: The merger model describes\nbetter the shell distributions and morphologies than the interaction model. Red\nshell colours are most likely due to the presence of dust and/or older stellar\npopulations. The high prevalence and out of dynamical equilibrium morphologies\nof the central dust features point towards external influences being\nresponsible for visible dust features in early type shell galaxies. Inner\nshells are able to manifest themselves in relatively old shell systems. \n\n"}

The galaxy distribution depends sensitively on the efficiency with\nwhich galaxies form in halos of different mass. In small mass halos, galaxy\nformation is inhibited by the reheating of cooled gas by feedback processes,\nwhereas in large mass halos, it is inhibited by the long cooling time of the\ngas. As a result, the mass-to-light ratio of halos has a deep minimum at the\nhalo mass associated with L* galaxies. This leads to a scale dependent bias in\nthe distribution of galaxies relative to the distribution of mass. On large\nscales, the bias in the galaxy distribution is related in a simple way to the\nbias in the distribution of massive halos. On small scales, the correlation\nfunction is determined by the interplay between various effects including the\nspatial exclusion of dark matter halos, the distribution function of the number\nof galaxies occupying a single dark matter halo and, to a lesser extent,\ndynamical friction. Remarkably, these processes conspire to produce a\ncorrelation function in a flat, Omega_0=0.3, CDM model that is close to a\npower-law over nearly four orders of magnitude in amplitude. This model agrees\nwell with the correlation function of galaxies measured in the APM survey.

In a non-supersymmetric case the inflaton\nusually decays via preheating unless its couplings to other fields are very\nsmall. Naively one would expect that supersymmetry enhances bosonic preheating\nas it introduces new scalars such as squarks and sleptons. On the contrary, we\npoint out that preheating is unlikely within supersymmetry. The reason is that\nflat directions in the scalar potential, classified by gauge invariant\ncombinations of slepton and squark fields, are generically displaced towards a\nlarge vacuum expectation value (VEV) in the early Universe. They induce\nsupersymmetry preserving masses to the inflaton decay products through the\nStandard Model Yukawa couplings, which kinematically blocks preheating for VEVs\n$> 10^{13}$ GeV. The decay will become allowed only after the flat directions\nstart oscillating, and once the flat direction VEV is sufficiently redshifted.\nFor models with weak scale supersymmetry, this generically happens at a Hubble\nexpansion rate: $H \\simeq (10^{-3}-10^{-1}) {\\rm TeV}$, at which time the\ninflaton decays in the perturbative regime.
