Then the measured values\nof the flavor parameters do not lead to any fundamental symmetries, but are\nstatistical accidents; their precise values do not provide any insights into\nthe fundamental theory, rather the overall pattern of flavor reflects the\nunderlying landscape. We investigate whether random selection from the\nstatistics of a simple landscape can explain the broad patterns of quark,\ncharged lepton, and neutrino masses and mixings. We propose Gaussian landscapes\nas simplified models of landscapes where Yukawa couplings result from overlap\nintegrals of zero-mode wavefunctions in higher-dimensional supersymmetric gauge\ntheories.

It has\nlong been known that in large Nc QCD, baryons composed entirely of heavy quarks\nare accurately described in the mean-field approximation. However, the detailed\nproperties of baryons in the combined large Nc and heavy quark limits have not\nbeen fully explored. Here some basic properties of baryons are computed using a\nvariational approach. At leading order in both the large Nc and heavy quark\nexpansions the baryon mass is computed explicitly as is the baryon form factor.\nBaryonic matter, the analog of nuclear matter in this artificial world, should\nalso be well described in the mean-field approximation. In the special case\nwhere all baryons have an identical spin flavor structure, it is shown that in\nthe formal heavy quark and large Nc limit interactions between baryons are\nstrictly repulsive at low densities. The energy per baryon is computed in this\nlimit and found to be exponentially small. It is shown that when the\nrestriction to baryons with an identical spin-flavor structure is dropped, a\nphase of baryonic matter exists with a density of 2Nf times that for the\nrestricted case but with the same energy (where Nf is the number of degenerate\nflavors).

In a class of such\nmodels, like the generalized Sakai-Sugimoto model, baryons take the form of\ninstantons of the effective flavor gauge theory that resides on probe flavor\nbranes. In this paper we study the phase structure of baryonic crystals by\nanalyzing discrete periodic configurations of such instantons. We find that\ninstanton configurations exhibit a series of \"popcorn\" transitions upon\nincreasing the density. Through these transitions normal (3D) lattices expand\ninto the transverse dimension, eventually becoming a higher dimensional (4D)\nmulti-layer lattice at large densities.\n  We consider 3D lattices of zero size instantons as well as 1D periodic chains\nof finite size instantons, which serve as toy models of the full holographic\nsystems. In particular, for the finite-size case we determine solutions of the\ncorresponding ADHM equations for both a straight chain and for a 2D zigzag\nconfiguration where instantons pop up into the holographic dimension. At low\ndensity the system takes the form of an \"abelian anti-ferromagnetic\" straight\nperiodic chain. Above a critical density there is a second order phase\ntransition into a zigzag structure.

This discrepancy has led to various, quite different\nexplanations in terms of increased axial masses, changes in the functional form\nof the axial form factor, increased vector strength in nuclei, and initial\ntwo-particle interactions. This is disconcerting since the neutrino energy\nreconstruction depends on the reaction mechanism. Purpose: We investigate\nwhether exclusive observables, such as nucleon knock-out, can be used to\ndistinguish between the various proposed reaction mechanisms. We determine the\ninfluence of 2p-2h excitations on the energy reconstruction. Method: We use the\nGiessen Boltzmann--Uehling--Uhlenbeck (GiBUU) model to predict numbers and\nspectra of knock-out nucleons. The model is extended by incorporating a simple,\nbut realistic treatment of initial 2p-2h excitations. Results: We show numbers\nand spectra of knock-out nucleons and show their sensitivity to the presence of\n2p-2h initial excitations.

Our results show that asymmetric mass ejection caused\nby hydrodynamic instabilities can accelerate the neutron star (NS) up to recoil\nvelocities of more than 700 km/s by the \"gravitational tug-boat mechanism\",\nwhich is enough to explain most observed pulsar velocities. The associated NS\nspin periods are about 100 ms to 8 s without any correlation between spin and\nkick magnitudes or directions. This suggests that faster spins and a possible\nspin-kick alignment might require angular momentum in the progenitor core prior\nto collapse. Our simulations for the first time demonstrate a clear correlation\nbetween the size of the NS kick and anisotropic ejection of heavy elements\ncreated by explosive burning behind the shock. In the case of large NS kicks\nthe explosion is significantly stronger opposite to the kick vector. Therefore\nthe bulk of the Fe-group elements, in particular nickel, is ejected mostly in\nlarge clumps against the kick direction. This contrasts with the case of low\nrecoil velocity, where the Ni-rich lumps are more isotropically distributed.\nIntermediate-mass nuclei heavier than Si (like Ca and Ti) also exhibit a\nsignificant enhancement in the hemisphere opposite to the direction of fast NS\nmotion, while the distribution of C, O, and Ne is not affected, and that of Mg\nonly marginally. Mapping the spatial distribution of the heavy elements in SN\nremnants with identified pulsar motion may offer an important diagnostic test\nof the kick mechanism. Different from kick scenarios based on anisotropic\nneutrino emission, our hydrodynamical acceleration model predicts enhanced\nejection of Fe-group elements and of their nuclear precursors in the direction\nopposite to the NS recoil.

It is important to justify this heuristic\ndescription for the case of baryonic matter since systems of interacting\nbaryons are intrinsically more complicated than single baryons due to the\npossibility of hidden color states---states in which the subsystems making up\nthe entire baryon crystal are not color-singlet nucleons but rather colorful\nstates coupled together to make a color-singlet state.

The Higgs mass exhausts one out of three\ninput parameters of the minimal, five-dimensional version of universal extra\ndimension models, the other two parameters being the Kaluza-Klein (KK) scale\nand the cut-off scale of the theory.

Here we\nsignificantly expand on our previous work and delineate two further\nself-similar regimes. One of these occurs in the deep infrared (IR) regime of\nvery high occupancies, where the nonequilibrium dynamics leads to the formation\nof a Bose-Einstein Condensate.

GW emission in the\npre-explosion phase strongly depends on whether the post-shock flow is\ndominated by the standing accretion shock instability (SASI) or convection and\ndiffers considerably from 2D models. SASI activity produces a strong signal\ncomponent below 250 Hz through asymmetric mass motions in the gain layer and a\nnon-resonant coupling to the proto-neutron star (PNS). Both convection- and\nSASI-dominated models show GW emission above 250 Hz, but with considerably\nlower amplitudes than in 2D. This is due to a different excitation mechanism\nfor high-frequency l=2 motions in the PNS surface, which are predominantly\nexcited by PNS convection in 3D. Resonant excitation of high-frequency surface\ng-modes in 3D by mass motions in the gain layer is suppressed compared to 2D\nbecause of smaller downflow velocities and a lack of high-frequency variability\nin the downflows. In the exploding 20 Msun model, shock revival results in\nenhanced low-frequency emission due to a change of the preferred scale of the\nconvective eddies in the PNS convection zone.

In the last decade, however, in an explosion of data\nfrom both $e^+e^-$ and hadron colliders, there are many recently observed\nstates that do not fit into this picture.

Measuring the\npolarizations of quarks produced in new physics processes, once discovered, can\nprovide crucial information about the new physics Lagrangian. In a series of\nrecent papers, we have investigated how quark polarization measurements can be\ndone in practice. The polarizations of heavy quarks (b and c) are expected to\nbe largely preserved in the lightest baryons they hadronize into, the Lambda_b\nand Lambda_c, respectively. Furthermore, it is known experimentally that\ns-quark polarization is preserved as well, in Lambda baryons. We study how\nATLAS and CMS can measure polarizations of b, c and s quarks using certain\ndecays of these baryons.

In particular, we demonstrate that such strings will generically\nbecome superconducting at moderately low temperatures, thus enhancing their\nstability. We then present a new class of defects - drum vortons - which arise\nwhen a small symmetry breaking term is added to the potential. We display these\npoints within the context of the O(4) sigma model, relevant for hadrodynamics\nbelow the QCD scale. This model admits `embedded defects' (topological defect\nconfigurations of a simpler - in this case O(2) symmetric - model obtained by\nimposing an embedding constraint) that are unstable in the full model at zero\ntemperature, but that can be stabilised (by electromagnetic coupling to\nphotons) in a thermal gas at moderately high termperatures. It is shown here\nthat below the embedded defect stabilisation threshold, there will still be\nstabilized cosmic string defects. However, they will not be of the symmetric\nembedded vortex type, but of an `asymmetric' vortex type, and are automatically\nsuperconducting. In the presence of weak symmetry breaking terms, such as arise\nnaturally when using the O(4) model for hadrodynamics, the strings become the\nboundary of a new kind of cosmic sigma membrane, with tension given by the pion\nmass. The string current would then make it possible for a loop to attain a\n(classically) stable equilibrium state that differs from an ``ordinary'' vorton\nstate by the presence of a sigma membrane stretched across it in a drum like\nconfiguration. Such defects will however be entirely destabilised if the\nsymmetry breaking is too strong, as is found to be the case -- due to the\nrather large value of the pion mass -- in the hadronic application of the O(4)\nsigma model. \n\n"}

The\nmicroscopic transport model UrQMD is used for this analysis. The predicted\nLambda/pi-, Xi-/pi- and Omega-/pi- ratios are enhanced due to rescattering in\ncentral Pb-Pb collisions as compared to peripheral Pb-Pb or p-Pb collisions. A\nreduction of the constituent quark masses to the current quark masses m_s \\sim\n230 MeV, m_q \\sim 10 MeV, as motivated by chiral symmetry restoration, enhances\nthe hyperon yields to the experimentally observed high values. Similar results\nare obtained by an ad hoc overall increase of the color electric field strength\n(effective string tension of kappa=3 GeV/fm). The enhancement depends strongly\non the kinematical cuts. The maximum enhancement is predicted around\nmidrapidity. For Lambda's, strangeness suppression is predicted at\nprojectile/target rapidity.

New estimates for\nisovector, tensor, and gradient terms in finite nuclei are shown to be\nconsistent with direct, high-quality fits. The estimates establish a hierarchy\nof model parameters and identify how many parameters are well constrained by\nbulk nuclear observables. We conclude that four (possibly five) isoscalar,\nnon-gradient parameters, one gradient parameter, and one isovector parameter\nare well determined by the usual bulk nuclear observables. \n\n"}

Abstract: Based upon the analogy to the electroweak phase diagram, I propose that in\nQCD there might be a critical line for a superfluid transition, in the plane of\nchemical potential and temperature. The order parameter has the quantum numbers\nof the H-dibaryon, but the transition is driven by color superconductivity in\nstrange quark matter. \n\n"}

Such studies complement\nmeasurements at high energies. We review the recent progress in atomic parity\nnonconservation and atomic electric dipole moments (time reversal symmetry\nviolation), with a particular focus on the atomic theory required to interpret\nthe measurements. \n\n"}
