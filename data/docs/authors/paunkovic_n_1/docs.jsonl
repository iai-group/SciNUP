When the co-dimension\nis non-zero, the system acquires fluid-elastic properties and constitutes what\nis called a fluid brane. Applying an effective action approach, the most\ngeneral form of the free energy quadratic in the extrinsic curvature and\nextrinsic twist potential of stationary fluid brane configurations is\nconstructed to second order in a derivative expansion. This construction\ngeneralizes the Helfrich-Canham bending energy for fluid membranes studied in\ntheoretical biology to the case in which the fluid is rotating. It is found\nthat stationary fluid brane configurations are characterized by a set of 3\nelastic response coefficients, 3 hydrodynamic response coefficients and 1 spin\nresponse coefficient for co-dimension greater than one. Moreover, the elastic\ndegrees of freedom present in the system are coupled to the hydrodynamic\ndegrees of freedom. For co-dimension-1 surfaces we find a 8 independent\nparameter family of stationary fluid branes. It is further shown that elastic\nand spin corrections to (non)-extremal brane effective actions can be accounted\nfor by a multipole expansion of the stress-energy tensor, therefore\nestablishing a relation between the different formalisms of Carter,\nCapovilla-Guven and Vasilic-Vojinovic and between gravity and the effective\ndescription of stationary fluid branes.

These\nequations represent a generalization of the Gaussian-Markovian quantum\nFokker-Planck equation introduced by Tanimura and Wolynes (1991), which was\nformulated to study non-Markovian and non-perturbative thermal effects at\nfinite temperature. This formalism allows us to treat both the classical limit\nand the tunneling regimes, and it is helpful for identifying purely quantum\nmechanical effects through the time evolution of the Wigner distribution. We\ncarried out extensive calculations of the classical and quantum currents for\nvarious temperatures, coupling strengths, and barrier heights. Our results\nreveal that at low temperature, while the quantum current is larger than the\nclassical current in the case of a high barrier, the opposite is true in the\ncase of a low barrier. We find that this behavior results from the fact that\nthe tunneling enhances the current in the case of a high barrier, while it\nsuppresses the current in the case of a low barrier. This is because the effect\nof the ratchet potential is weak in the case of a low barrier, due to the large\ndispersion of the distribution introduced by tunneling.

A first step is to stabilize a non-equilibrium state of a\nsimple quantum system such as a qubit or a cavity mode in the presence of\ndecoherence. Several groups have recently accomplished this goal using\nmeasurement-based feedback schemes. A next step is to prepare and stabilize a\nstate of a composite system. Here we demonstrate the stabilization of an\nentangled Bell state of a quantum register of two superconducting qubits for an\narbitrary time. Our result is achieved by an autonomous feedback scheme which\ncombines continuous drives along with a specifically engineered coupling\nbetween the two-qubit register and a dissipative reservoir. Similar autonomous\nfeedback techniques have recently been used for qubit reset and the\nstabilization of a single qubit state, as well as for creating and stabilizing\nstates of multipartite quantum systems.

Included in the class of QCMDO problems are combinatorial\noptimization problems constrained by a linear partial differential equation\n(PDE) or system of linear PDEs. An essential complication commonly encountered\nin solving this type of problem is that the linear constraint may introduce\nmany intermediate continuous variables into the optimization while the\ncomputational cost grows exponentially with problem size. We resolve this\ndifficulty by developing a constructive mapping from QCMDO to quadratic\nunconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) such that the size of the QUBO problem\ndepends only on the number of discrete control variables. With a suitable\nembedding, taking into account the physical constraints of the realizable\ncoupling graph, the resulting QUBO problem can be implemented on an existing\nAQO. The mapping itself is efficient, scaling cubically with the number of\ncontinuous variables in the general case and linearly in the PDE case if an\nefficient preconditioner is available. \n\n"}

The significant advantage of the\ndisplaced oscillator basis enables us to apply the same truncation techniques\nadopted in the single qubit Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model to the multiple qubits\nsystem.

This process consists in the progressive\ndifferentiation of an intrinsically undifferentiated entity. By entering into\nreflexive spatial relations, this gives rise to (i) what looks like a\nmultiplicity of relata if the reflexive quality of the relations is not taken\ninto account, and (ii) what looks like a substantial expanse if the spatial\nquality of the relations is reified.

In quantum mechanics\ninternal energy is given by a Hamiltonian operator describing dynamics of\ninternal degrees of freedom. We therefore introduce a quantum formulation of\nthe EEP -- equivalence between the rest, inertial and gravitational internal\nenergy operators. We show that the validity of the classical EEP does not imply\nthe validity of its quantum formulation, which thus requires an independent\nexperimental verification. We reanalyse some already completed experiments with\nrespect to the quantum EEP and discuss to which extent they allow testing its\nvarious aspects. \n\n"}

As a result, it cannot achieve the Gbps secret-key rate\nneeded for one-time pad encryption of large data files unless an impractically\nlarge amount of multiplexing is employed. We introduce floodlight QKD (FL-QKD),\nwhich floods the quantum channel with a high number of photons per bit\ndistributed over a much greater number of optical modes. FL-QKD offers security\nagainst the optimum frequency-domain collective attack by transmitting less\nthan one photon per mode and using photon-coincidence channel monitoring, and\nit is completely immune to passive eavesdropping. More importantly, FL-QKD is\ncapable of a 2 Gbps secret-key rate over a 50 km fiber link, without any\nmultiplexing, using available equipment, i.e., no new technology need be\ndeveloped. FL-QKD achieves this extraordinary secret-key rate by virtue of its\nunprecedented secret-key efficiency, in bits per channel use, which exceeds\nthose of state-of-the-art systems by two orders of magnitude. \n\n"}

As a frustrated spin model, it is well outside the\ncommuting models of topological quantum codes that are typically studied, but\nits exact solubility makes it more amenable to analysis of effects arising in\nthis noncommutative setting than a generic topologically ordered Hamiltonian.\nHere we study quantum error correction in the honeycomb model using both\nanalytic and numerical techniques. We first prove explicit exponential bounds\non the approximate degeneracy, local indistinguishability, and correctability\nof the code space. These bounds are tighter than can be achieved using known\ngeneral properties of topological phases. Our proofs are specialized to the\nhoneycomb model, but some of the methods may nonetheless be of broader\ninterest.

Our method provides, in particular, a more precise formulation of the\nHartle-Hawking no boundary proposal, as a sum over real Lorentzian\nfour-geometries interpolating between an initial three-geometry of zero size,\n{\\it i.e}, a point, and a final three-geometry. With this definition, we\ncalculated the no boundary amplitude for a closed universe with a cosmological\nconstant, assuming cosmological symmetry for the background and including\nlinear perturbations. We found the opposite semiclassical exponent to that\nobtained by Hartle and Hawking for the creation of a de Sitter spacetime \"from\nnothing\".

Contrary to some misinterpretations of the Principle, the mere\ntransfer of entropy between computational and non-computational subsystems can\noccur in a thermodynamically reversible way without increasing total entropy.\nHowever, Landauer's Principle is not about general entropy transfers; rather,\nit more specifically concerns the ejection of (all or part of) some correlated\ninformation from a controlled, digital form (e.g., a computed bit) to an\nuncontrolled, non-computational form, i.e., as part of a thermal environment.\nAny uncontrolled thermal system will, by definition, continually re-randomize\nthe physical information in its thermal state, from our perspective as\nobservers who cannot predict the exact dynamical evolution of the microstates\nof such environments.

These hidden subgroup problems are then solved\nby Fourier sampling: the quantum Fourier transform of y is computed and\nmeasured. When the underlying group is non-Abelian, two important variants of\nthe Fourier sampling paradigm have been identified: the weak standard method,\nwhere only representation names are measured, and the strong standard method,\nwhere full measurement occurs. It has remained open whether the strong standard\nmethod is indeed stronger, that is, whether there are hidden subgroups that can\nbe reconstructed via the strong method but not by the weak, or any other known,\nmethod. In this article, we settle this question in the affirmative. We show\nthat hidden subgroups of semidirect products of Z_p by Z_q, where q divides\n(p-1) and q = p / polylog(p), can be efficiently determined by the strong\nstandard method.

Abstract: We consider the hypothesis that quantum mechanics is an approximation to\nanother, cosmological theory, accurate only for the description of subsystems\nof the universe. Quantum theory is then to be derived from the cosmological\ntheory by averaging over variables which are not internal to the subsystem,\nwhich may be considered non-local hidden variables. We find conditions for\narriving at quantum mechanics through such a procedure. The key lesson is that\nthe effect of the coupling to the external degrees of freedom introduces noise\ninto the evolution of the system degrees of freedom, while preserving a notion\nof averaged conserved energy and time reversal invariance.\n  These conditions imply that the effective description of the subsystem is\nNelson's stochastic formulation of quantum theory. We show that Nelson's\nformulation is not, by itself, a classical stochastic theory as the conserved\naveraged energy is not a linear function of the probability density. We also\ninvestigate an argument of Wallstrom posed against the equivalence of Nelson's\nstochastic mechanics and quantum mechanics and show that, at least for a simple\ncase, it is in error. \n\n"}

Contrary to folklore, the\ninterpretation question was not settled at this conference and no consensus was\nreached; instead, a range of sharply conflicting views were presented and\nextensively discussed. Today, there is no longer an established or dominant\ninterpretation of quantum theory, so it is important to re-evaluate the\nhistorical sources and keep the interpretation debate open. In this spirit, we\nprovide a complete English translation of the original proceedings (lectures\nand discussions), and give background essays on the three main interpretations\npresented: de Broglie's pilot-wave theory, Born and Heisenberg's quantum\nmechanics, and Schroedinger's wave mechanics. We provide an extensive analysis\nof the lectures and discussions that took place, in the light of current\ndebates about the meaning of quantum theory. The proceedings contain much\nunexpected material, including extensive discussions of de Broglie's pilot-wave\ntheory (which de Broglie presented for a many-body system), and a \"quantum\nmechanics\" apparently lacking in wave function collapse or fundamental time\nevolution.
