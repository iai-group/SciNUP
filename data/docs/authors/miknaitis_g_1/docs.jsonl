Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on\nthe role that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in\nglobular clusters, e.g., influencing the distribution of horizontal branch\nstars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of some globular clusters, and in\nforming low mass white dwarfs. \n\n"}

As young AGN\n(quasars) they are initially several magnitudes sub-luminous to mature galaxies\nbut their luminosity gradually increases over 10^8 yrs, as z_(i) decreases and\nthey evolve into mature AGN (Seyferts and radio galaxies). Evidence presented\nhere that low- and intermediate-redshift AGN are unquestionably sub-luminous to\nradio galaxies is then strong support for this model and makes it likely that\nthe high-redshift AGN (quasars) are also sub-luminous, having simply been\npushed above the radio galaxies on a logz-m_(v) plot by the presence of a large\nintrinsic component in their redshifts. An increase in luminosity below z =\n0.06 is also seen.

The galaxy is known to possess a dramatic 70 kpc\nX-ray tail. The detected H-alpha tail coincides positionally with the X-ray\ntail. The H-alpha emission in the galaxy is sharply truncated on the front and\nthe sides near the nucleus, indicating significant ram pressure stripping. ESO\n137-001 is thus the first cluster late-type galaxy known unambiguously with\nboth an X-ray tail and an H-alpha tail. The emission-line objects are all\ndistributed downstream of the galaxy, with projected distance up to 39 kpc from\nthe galaxy. From the analysis on the H-alpha_{off} frame and the estimate of\nthe background emission-line objects, we conclude that it is very likely all 29\nemission-line objects are HII regions in A3627. The high surface number density\nand luminosities of these HII regions (up to 10^40 ergs/s) dwarf the previously\nknown examples of isolated HII regions in clusters.

Cosmic evolution of the space density of FRI radio sources Abstract: In this paper the cosmic evolution of the space density of Fanaroff & Riley\nClass I (FRI) radio sources is investigated out to z ~ 1, in order to\nunderstand the origin of the differences between these and the more powerful\nFRIIs. High resolution radio images are presented of the best high redshift FRI\ncandidate galaxies, drawn from two fields of the Leiden Berkeley Deep Survey,\nand previously defined in Rigby, Snellen & Best (2007, Paper I). Together with\nlower resolution radio observations (both previously published in Paper I and,\nfor a subset of sources, also presented here) these are used to morphologically\nclassify the sample. Sources which are clearly resolved are classified by\nmorphology alone, whereas barely or unresolved sources were classified using a\ncombination of morphology and flux density loss in the higher resolution data,\nindicative of resolved out extended emission. The space densities of the FRIs\nare then calculated as a function of redshift, and compared to both\nmeasurements of the local value and the behaviour of the more powerful FRIIs.\nThe space density of FRI radio sources with luminosities (at 1.4 GHz) > 10^25\nW/Hz is enhanced by a factor of 5-9 by z ~ 1, implying moderately strong\nevolution of this population; this enhancement is in good agreement with models\nof FRII evolution at the same luminosity.

Such stars are thought to be ejected through dynamical\ninteractions near the massive black hole (MBH) in the Galactic center. Three\nscenarios have been suggested for their ejection; binary disruption by a MBH,\nscattering by inspiraling IMBH and scattering by stellar BHs close to MBH.\nThese scenarios involve different stellar populations in the Galactic center.\nHere we use observations of the Galactic center stellar population together\nwith dynamical and evolutionary arguments to obtain strong constraints on the\nnature and origin of HVSs. We show that the IMBH inspiral scenario requires too\nmany (O(10^3)) main sequence B stars to exist close to the MBH (<0.01 pc) at\nthe time of inspiral, where current observations show O(10) such stars.\nScattering by SBHs also require too many B stars to be observed in the GC, but\nit may contribute a small fraction of the currently observed HVSs. The binary\ndisruption scenario is still consistent with current observations. In addition\nit is shown that recently suggested signatures for HVSs origin such as\nhypervelocity binaries and slow rotating HVSs are much weaker than suggested\nand require too large statistics. In addition, we show that due to the\nconditions close to the MBH most binary star systems are not expected to\nsurvive for long in this region. Consequently, unique stellar populations that\nrequire long evolution in binaries are not expected to be ejected as HVSs in\nthe BHs scattering mechanisms (this may also be related to to the recently\nobserved asymmetry in the velocity distribution of HVSs). \n\n"}

Such discs\nshould arise frequently, but should be observed infrequently, precisely because\nthey fragment rapidly. By performing an ensemble of radiation-hydrodynamic\nsimulations, we show that such discs fragment within a few thousand years, and\nproduce mainlybrown dwarf (BDs) stars, but also planetary mass (PM) stars and\nvery low-mass hydrogen-burning (HB) stars. Most of the the PM stars and BDs are\nejected by mutual interactions. We analyse the statistical properties of these\nstars, and compare them with observations. After a few hundred thousand years\nthe Sun-like primary is typically left with a close low-mass HB companion, and\ntwo much wider companions: a low-mass HB star and a BD star, or a BD-BD binary.\nThere is a BD desert extending out to at least ~100 AU; this is because BDs\ntend to be formed further out than low-mass HB stars, and then they tend to be\nscattered even further out, or even into the field. BDs form with discs of a\nfew Mj and radii of a few tens of AU, and they are more likely to retain these\ndiscs if they remain bound to the primary star. Binaries form by pairing of the\nnewly-formed stars in the disc, giving a low-mass binary fraction of ~0.16.\nThese binaries include close and wide BD/BD binaries and BD/PM binaries.

We compare the statistical properties of LBGs' physical\nparameters -- such as stellar mass, SFR, and stellar population age -- as\nderived from the best-fit galaxy templates with the intrinsic values from the\nsemi-analytic model.

Akari mapping\n  of an externally heated pre-stellar core Abstract: We present observations of L1155 and L1148 in the Cepheus molecular cloud,\ntaken using the FIS instrument on the Akari satellite. We compare these data to\nsubmillimetre data taken using the SCUBA camera on the JCMT, and far-infrared\ndata taken with the ISOPHOT camera on board the ISO satellite. All of the data\nshow a relation between the position of the peak of emission and the wavelength\nfor the core of L1155. We interpret this as a temperature gradient. We fit\nmodified blackbody curves to the spectral energy distributions at two positions\nin the core and see that the central core in L1155 (L1155C) is approximately 2\ndegrees warmer at one edge than it is in the centre. We consider a number of\npossible heating sources and conclude that the A6V star BD+67 1263 is the most\nlikely candidate. This star is at a distance of 0.7 pc from the front of L1155C\nin the plane of the sky. We carry out radiative transfer modelling of the\nL1155C core including the effects from the nearby star. We find that we can\ngenerate a good fit to the observed data at all wavelengths, and demonstrate\nthat the different morphologies of the core at different wavelengths can be\nexplained by the observed 2 degree temperature gradient. The L1148 core\nexhibits a similar morphology to that of L1155C, and the data are also\nconsistent with a temperature gradient across the core. In this case, the most\nlikely heating source is the star BD197053. Our findings illustrate very\nclearly that the apparent observed morphology of a pre-stellar core can be\nhighly dependent on the wavelength of the observation, and that temperature\ngradients must be taken into account before converting images into column\ndensity distributions.

Weak\n  Lensing Abstract: Attempts to constrain the Hubble constant using the strong gravitational lens\nsystem Q0957+561 are limited by systematic uncertainties in the mass model,\nsince the time delay is known very precisely. One important systematic effect\nis the mass sheet degeneracy, which arises because strong lens modeling cannot\nconstrain the presence or absence of a uniform mass sheet $\\kappa$, which\nrescales $H_0$ by the factor $(1-\\kappa)$. In this paper we present new\nconstraints on the mass sheet derived from a weak-lensing analysis of the\nHubble Space Telescope imaging of a 6 arcmin square region surrounding the\nlensed quasar. The average mass sheet within a circular aperture (the strong\nlens model region) is constrained by integrating the tangential weak\ngravitational shear over the surrounding area.

It is found that if galaxies are aligned\nby large-scale tidal fields, then these selection effects give rise to a\ndependence of the observed galaxy density on the local tidal field, in addition\nto the well-known dependences on the matter density and radial velocity\ngradient. This alters the galaxy power spectrum in a way that is different for\nFourier modes parallel to and perpendicular to the line of sight. These tidal\ngalaxy alignments can thus mimic redshift space distortions, and thus result in\na bias in the measurement of the velocity power spectrum. If galaxy\norientations are affected only by the local tidal field, then the tidal\nalignment effect has exactly the same scale and angular dependence as the\nredshift space distortions in the linear regime, so it cannot be projected out\nor removed by masking small scales in the analysis. We consider several toy\nmodels of tidal alignments and orientation-dependent selection, normalize their\nfree parameter (an amplitude) to recent observations, and find that they could\nbias the velocity amplitude f(z)G(z) by 5--10 per cent in some models, although\nmost models give much smaller contamination.

SN2006gy can be interpreted in the\ncontext of shock interaction with a dense CSM, but with quite extreme values\nfor the CSM mass of 20 Msun and an explosion kinetic energy of at least 5e51\nerg. A key difference between SN2006gy and other SNeIIn is that, owing to its\nlarge CSM mass, the interaction region remained opaque much longer. At early\ntimes, H-alpha widths suggest that the photosphere is ahead of the shock, and\nphotons diffuse out through the opaque CSM. The pivotal transition to optically\nthin emission begins around day 110, when we start to see a decrease in the\nblackbody radius and strengthening tracers of the post-shock shell.

We use a nuclear reaction network to calculate the heating (due to\nbeta-decays and nuclear fission) experienced by material on the\nmarginally-bound orbits nominally responsible for late-time fall-back. Since\nmatter with longer orbital periods t_orb experiences lower densities, for\nlonger periods of time, the total r-process heating rises rapidly with t_orb,\nsuch that material with t_orb > 1 seconds can become completely unbound. Thus,\nr-process heating fundamentally changes the canonical prediction of an\nuninterrupted power-law decline in the fall-back rate dM/dt at late times.

The prompt emission pulses are produced by a bipolar jet of highly\nrelativistic plasmoids (CBs) ejected in the early, major episodes of mass\naccretion. As the accretion material is consumed, one may expect the engine's\nactivity to weaken. X-ray flares ending the prompt emission and during the\nafterglow phase are produced in such delayed episodes of mass accretion. The\ncommon engine, environment and radiation mechanisms (inverse Compton scattering\nand synchrotron radiation) produce their observed similarities. Flares in both\nlong GRBs and short hard gamma ray bursts (SHBs) can also be produced by\nbipolar ejections of CBs following a phase transition in compact objects due to\nloss of angular momentum and/or cooling. Optical flares, however, are mostly\nproduced in collisions of CBs with massive stellar winds/ejecta or with density\nbumps along their path. In this paper we show that the master formulae of the\nCB model of GRBs and SHBs, which reproduce very well their prompt emission\npulses and their smooth afterglows, seem to reproduce also very well the\nlightcurves and spectral evolution of the prominent X-ray and optical flares\nthat are well sampled. \n\n"}

Abstract: We analyze the clustering of red and blue galaxies from four samples spanning\na redshift range of 0.4<z<2.0 to test the various scenarios by which galaxies\nevolve onto the red sequence. The data are taken from the UKIDSS Ultra Deep\nSurvey, DEEP2, and COMBO-17. The use of clustering allows us to determine what\nfraction of the red sequence is made up of central galaxies and satellite\ngalaxies. At all redshifts, including z=0, the data are consistent with ~60% of\nsatellite galaxies being red or quenched, implying that ~1/3 of the red\nsequence is comprised of satellite galaxies. More than three-fourths of red\nsatellite galaxies were moved to the red sequence after they were accreted onto\na larger halo. The constant fraction of satellite galaxies that are red yields\na quenching time for satellite galaxies that depends on redshift in the same\nway as halo dynamical times; t_Q ~ (1+z)^{-1.5}. In three of the four samples,\nthe data favor a model in which red central galaxies are a random sample of all\ncentral galaxies; there is no preferred halo mass scale at which galaxies make\nthe transition from star-forming to red and dead. The large errors on the\nfourth sample inhibit any conclusions. Theoretical models in which star\nformation is quenched above a critical halo mass are excluded by these data. A\nscenario in which mergers create red central galaxies imparts a weaker\ncorrelation between halo mass and central galaxy color, but even the merger\nscenario creates tension with red galaxy clustering at redshifts above 0.5.\nThese results suggest that the mechanism by which central galaxies become red\nevolves from z=0.5 to z=0. \n\n"}

The simulations use the code presented\nin (F.S., arXiv:0905.0858) and solve the full non-linear equation for the\nbrane-bending mode in conjunction with the usual gravitational dynamics. The\nbrane-bending mode is attractive rather than repulsive in the DGP normal\nbranch, hence the sign of the modified gravity effects is reversed compared to\nthose presented in arXiv:0905.0858.

In three dimensions,\nthis Standing Accretion Shock Instability (SASI) can develop spiral modes that\nspin-up the protoneutron star. Here we study these non-axisymmetric modes by\ncombining linear stability analysis and three-dimensional, time-dependent\nhydrodynamic simulations with Zeus-MP, focusing on characterizing their spatial\nstructure and angular momentum content. We do not impose any rotation on the\nbackground accretion flow, and use simplified microphysics with no neutrino\nheating or nuclear dissociation. Spiral modes are examined in isolation by\nchoosing flow parameters such that only the fundamental mode is unstable for a\ngiven polar index, leading to good agreement with linear theory. We find that\nany superposition of sloshing modes with non-zero relative phases survives in\nthe nonlinear regime and leads to angular momentum redistribution. It follows\nthat the range of perturbations required to obtain spin-up is broader than that\nneeded to obtain the limiting case of a phase shift of pi/2. The bulk of the\nangular momentum redistribution occurs during a phase of exponential growth,\nand arises from internal torques that are second order in the perturbation\namplitude. This redistribution gives rise to at least two counter rotating\nregions, with the maximum angular momentum of a given sign approaching a\nsignificant fraction of the mass accretion rate times the shock radius squared\n(Mdot * r_shock^2 ~ 1E+47 g/cm^2/s, spin period ~60 ms).

By considering broadband colors as a function of galaxy\ninclination we are able to confidently separate trends arising from increasing\ndust opacity from possible differences in stellar populations, since stellar\npopulations do not correlate with inclination. All commonly employed dust\nattenuation curves (such as the Calzetti curve for starbursts, or a power-law\ncurve) provide poor fits to the ultraviolet colors for moderately and highly\ninclined galaxies. This conclusion rests on the fact that the average FUV-NUV\ncolor varies little from face-on to edge-on galaxies, while other colors such\nas NUV-u and u-r vary strongly with inclination. After considering a number of\nmodel variations, we are led to speculate that the presence of the strong dust\nextinction feature at 2175A seen in the Milky Way (MW) extinction curve is\nresponsible for the observed trends. Independent of our interpretation, these\nresults imply that the modeling of dust attenuation in the ultraviolet is\nsignificantly more complicated than traditionally assumed. These results also\nimply a very weak dependence of the FUV-NUV color on total FUV attenuation, and\nwe conclude from this that it is extremely difficult to use only the observed\nUV spectral slope to infer the total UV dust attenuation, as is commonly done.\nWe propose several simple tests that might finally identify the grain\npopulation responsible for the 2175A feature. \n\n"}

Using N-body simulations we identify dark matter\nhalos over a broad mass range. We compute the power spectra and correlation\nfunctions for the halos and then examine how well the redshift distortion\nparameter beta=f/b can be reconstructed as a function of halo mass. We find\nthat beta measured for a fixed halo mass is generally a function of scale even\non large scales, in contrast with the common expectation that beta approaches a\nconstant described by Kaiser's formula on such scales. The scale dependence\ndepends on the halo mass, being stronger for smaller halos. It also cannot be\neasily explained with the well-known distribution function of the halo peculiar\nvelocities. We demonstrate that the biasing for smaller halos has larger\nnonlinearity and stochasticity, thus the linear bias assumption becomes worse\nfor smaller halos. Only for massive halos with b>1.5, beta approaches the\nlinear theory prediction on scales of r or pi/k>30Mpc/h.

We take\nmagnetic helicity evolution into account by solving a dynamical equation for\nthe magnetic alpha effect. This gives a consistent description of the quenching\nmechanism in mean-field dynamo models. The main goal of this work is to explore\nthe effects of this quenching mechanism in solar-like geometry, and in\nparticular to investigate the role of magnetic helicity fluxes, specifically\ndiffusive and Vishniac-Cho (VC) fluxes, at large magnetic Reynolds numbers\n(Rm). For models with negative radial shear or positive latitudinal shear, the\nmagnetic alpha effect has predominantly negative (positive) sign in the\nnorthern (southern) hemisphere. In the absence of fluxes, we find that the\nmagnetic energy follows an Rm^-1 dependence, as found in previous works. This\ncatastrophic quenching is alleviated in models with diffusive magnetic helicity\nfluxes resulting in magnetic fields comparable to the equipartition value even\nfor Rm=10^7. On the other hand, models with a shear-driven Vishniac-Cho flux\nshow an increase of the amplitude of the magnetic field with respect to models\nwithout fluxes, but only for Rm<10^4. This is mainly a consequence of assuming\na vacuum outside the Sun which cannot support a significant VC flux across the\nboundary.

In addition to this destructive effect, tidal forces can morph\ninto a transient, protective setting called compressive mode. Such modes then\nshelter the matter in their midst by increasing its gravitational binding\nenergy. This thesis focuses on the study of this poorly known regime by\nquantifying its properties thanks to numerical and analytical tools applied to\na spectacular merging system of two galaxies, commonly known as the Antennae\ngalaxies. N-body simulations of this pair yield compressive modes in the\nregions where observations reveal a burst of star formation. Furthermore,\ncharacteristic time- and energy scales of these modes match well those of\nself-gravitating substructures such as star clusters and tidal dwarf galaxies.\nThese results suggest that the compressive modes of tidal fields plays an\nimportant role in the formation and evolution of young clusters, at least in a\nstatistical sense, over a lapse of ~10 million years.

II.\n  Measuring the Size of the \"Frozen\" Zone Abstract: Coagulation of submicron-sized dust grains into porous aggregates is the\ninitial step of dust evolution in protoplanetary disks. Recently, it has been\npointed out that negative charging of dust in the weakly ionized disks could\nsignificantly slow down the coagulation process. In this paper, we apply the\ngrowth criteria obtained in Paper I to finding out a location (\"frozen\" zone)\nwhere the charging stalls dust growth at the fractal growth stage. For\nlow-turbulence disks, we find that the frozen zone can cover the major part of\nthe disks at a few to 100 AU from the central star. The maximum mass of the\naggregates is approximately 10^{-7} g at 1 AU and as small as a few monomer\nmasses at 100 AU. Strong turbulence can significantly reduce the size of the\nfrozen zone, but such turbulence will cause the fragmentation of macroscopic\naggregates at later stages. We examine a possibility that complete freezeout of\ndust evolution in low-turbulence disks could be prevented by global transport\nof dust in the disks. Our simple estimation shows that global dust transport\ncan lead to the supply of macroscopic aggregates and the removal of frozen\naggregates on a timescale of 10^6 yr. This overturns the usual understanding\nthat tiny dust particles get depleted on much shorter timescales unless\ncollisional fragmentation is effective. The frozen zone together with global\ndust transport might explain \"slow\" (\\sim 10^6 yr) dust evolution suggested by\ninfrared observation of T Tauri stars and by radioactive dating of chondrites. \n\n"}

The moving hotspots are sandwiched between two shocks. An\ninner-facing shock receives momentum and cosmic rays from the jet and creates\nadditional cosmic rays that form a radio lobe elongated along the jet axis. An\nouter-facing bow shock moves directly into the undisturbed group or cluster\ngas, creating a cocoon of shocked gas enclosing the radio lobe. We describe\ncomputations that follow the self-consistent dynamical evolution of the shocked\ncluster gas and the relativistic synchrotron-emitting gas inside the lobes.\nRelativistic and non-relativistic components exchange momentum by interacting\nwith small magnetic fields having dynamically negligible energy densities. The\nevolution of Cygnus A is governed almost entirely by cosmic ray energy flowing\nfrom the hotspots. Mass flowing into hotspots from the jets is assumed to be\nsmall, greatly reducing the mass of gas flowing back along the jet, common in\nprevious calculations, that would disrupt the spatial segregation of\nsynchrotron-loss ages observed inside FR II radio lobes.

After\nintroducing a number of observational constraints from the solar system, from\nobserved protoplanetary disks, and from the extrasolar planets, we simplify the\nproblem by dividing it into a number of discrete stages which are assumed to\noccur in a sequential way. In the first stage - the growth from dust to\nkilometer sized planetesimals - the aerodynamics of the bodies are of central\nimportance. We discuss both a purely coagulative growth mode, as well as a\ngravoturbulent mode involving a gravitational instability of the dust. In the\nnext stage, planetesimals grow to protoplanets of roughly 1000 km in size.\nGravity is now the dominant force. The mass accretion can be strongly\nnon-linear, leading to the detachment of a few big bodies from the remaining\nplanetesimals. In the outer planetary system (outside a few AU), some of these\nbodies can become so massive that they eventually accrete a large gaseous\nenvelope. This is the stage of giant planet formation, as understood within the\ncore accretion-gas capture paradigm. We also discuss the direct gravitational\ncollapse model where giant planets are thought to form directly via a\ngravitational fragmentation of the gas disk. In the inner system, protoplanets\ncollide in the last stage - probably after the dispersal of the gaseous disk -\nin giant impacts until the separations between the remaining terrestrial\nplanets become large enough to allow long term stability.

As a\nquantum theory the conformal theory is both renormalizable and unitary, with\nunitarity being obtained because the theory is a $PT$ symmetric rather than a\nHermitian theory. We show that in the theory there can be no a priori classical\ncurvature, with all curvature having to result from quantization. In the\nconformal theory gravity requires no independent quantization of its own, with\nit being quantized solely by virtue of its being coupled to a quantized matter\nsource. Moreover, because it is this very coupling that fixes the strength of\nthe gravitational field commutators, the gravity sector zero-point energy\ndensity and pressure fluctuations are then able to identically cancel the\nzero-point fluctuations associated with the matter sector. In addition, we show\nthat when the conformal symmetry is spontaneously broken, the zero-point\nstructure automatically readjusts so as to identically cancel the cosmological\nconstant term that dynamical mass generation induces. We show that the\nmacroscopic classical theory that results from the quantum conformal theory\nincorporates global physics effects that provide for a detailed accounting of a\ncomprehensive set of 138 galactic rotation curves with no adjustable parameters\nother than the galactic mass to light ratios, and with the need for no dark\nmatter whatsoever.

To explain this observation we propose a model, in which rapid transport\nof metals from the disk onto the WD naturally results from interaction between\nthis particulate disk and spatially coexisting disk of metallic gas.

This research note presents a full analysis of the CAFOS polarimeter\nmounted at the Calar Alto 2.2m telescope. It also provides future users of this\nmode with all necessary information to properly correct for instrumental\neffects in polarization data obtained with this instrument.\n  Methods. The standard stars BD+59d389 (polarized) and HD14069 (unpolarized)\nwere observed with CAFOS in November, 2010, using 16 half-wave plate angles.\nThe linear spectropolarimetric properties of CAFOS were studied using a Fourier\nAnalysis of the resulting data.\n  Results. CAFOS shows a roughly constant instrumental polarization at the\nlevel of ~0.3% between 4000 and 8600 A. Below 4000 A the spurious polarization\ngrows to reach ~0.7% at 3600 A. This instrumental effect is most likely\nproduced by the telescope optics, and appears to be additive. The Wollaston\nprism presents a clear deviation from the ideal behavior. The problem is\nlargely removed by the usage of at least 4 retarder plate angles. The\nchromatism of the half-wave plate causes a peak-to-peak oscillation of ~11\ndegrees in the polarization angle. This can be effectively corrected using the\ntabulated values presented in this paper. The Fourier analysis shows that the\nk!=0,4 harmonics are practically negligible between 3800 and 7400 A.\n  Conclusions. After correcting for instrumental polarization and retarder\nplate chromatism, with 4 half-wave plate angles CAFOS can reach an rms linear\npolarization accuracy of about 0.1%. \n\n"}

We consider a wide range of cloudy and cloud-free models. The cloudy\nmodels incorporate different geometrical and optical thicknesses, modal\nparticle sizes, and metallicities. For each planet and set of cloud parameters,\nwe explore grids in gravity and effective temperature, with which we determine\nconstraints on the planet's mass and age. Our new models yield statistically\nsignificant fits to the data, and conclusively confirm that the HR 8799 planets\nhave much thicker clouds than those required to explain data for typical L and\nT dwarfs.

Current data are insufficient to\naccurately constrain the microscopic cloud properties, such as composition and\nparticle size. The range of best-estimated masses for HR 8799b, HR 8799c, and\nHR 8799d conservatively span 2-12 M_J, 6-13 M_J, and 3-11 M_J, respectively and\nimply coeval ages between ~10 and ~150 Myr, consistent with previously reported\nstellar age.

Merging galaxies\noccupy a particular part of parameter space defined by Asymmetry (A), the\nrelative contribution of the 20% brightest pixels to the second order moment of\nthe column density map (M20) and the distribution of the second order moment\nover all the pixels (GM). Based on their HI morphology, we find that 13% of the\nWHISP galaxies are in an interaction (Concentration-M20) and only 7% based on\nclose companions in the data-cube. This apparent discrepancy can be attributed\nto the difference in visibility time scales: mergers are identifiable as close\npairs for 0.5 Gyr but ~1 Gyr by their disturbed HI morphology. Expressed as\nvolume merger rates, the two estimates agree very well: 7 and 6.8 x 10^-3\nmergers Gyr^-1 Mpc^-3 for paired and morphologically disturbed HI disks\nrespectively. The consistency of our merger fractions to those published for\nbigger surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, shows that HI morphology\ncan be a very viable way to identify mergers in a large HI survey.

Our goal was to detect the\nRossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect, the anomalous radial velocity observed during\neclipses of rotating stars, which can be used to study the obliquities of\nplanet-hosting stars. For WASP-1 a weak signal of a prograde orbit was detected\nwith ~2sigma confidence, and for WASP-2 no signal was detected. The resulting\nupper bounds on the RM amplitude have different implications for these two\nsystems, because of the contrasting transit geometries and the stellar types.\nBecause WASP-1 is an F7V star, and such stars are typically rapid rotators, the\nmost probable reason for the suppression of the RM effect is that the star is\nviewed nearly pole-on. This implies the WASP-1 star has a high obliquity with\nrespect to the edge-on planetary orbit. Because WASP-2 is a K1V star, and is\nexpected to be a slow rotator, no firm conclusion can be drawn about the\nstellar obliquity.

We model the detailed physics of these\nfast accretion shocks, and apply these to a simple 1-D spherical hydrodynamic\naccretion model for baryonic infall in dark matter halos with an Einasto\ndensity distribution. The escape of UV photons from these halos is delayed by\nthe time taken to reach the critical accretion shock velocity for escape of UV\nphotons; 220 km s$^{-1}$, and by the time it takes for these photons to ionize\nthe surrounding baryonic matter in the accretion flow. Assuming that in the\nuniverse at large the baryonic matter tracks the dark matter, we can estimate\nthe epoch of re-ionization in the case that accretion shocks act alone as the\nsource of UV photons. We find that 50% of the volume (and 5-8% of the mass) of\nthe universe can be ionized by $z \\sim 7-8$. The UV production rate has an\nuncertainty of a factor of about 5 due to uncertainties in the cosmological\nparameters controlling the development of large scale structure.

We compute the orbits\nconfined by the invariant manifolds of the unstable periodic orbits located at\nthe ends of the bar. We discuss whether the COBE/DIRBE bar and the Long bar\ncompose a single bar or two independent bars and perform a number of\ncomparisons which, taken together, argue strongly in favour of the former. More\nspecifically, we favour the possibility that the so-called COBE/DIRBE bar is\nthe boxy/peanut bulge of a bar whose outer thin parts are the so-called Long\nbar. This possibility is in good agreement both with observations of external\ngalaxies, with orbital structure theory and with simulations. We then analyse\nin detail the morphology and kinematics given by five representative Galactic\npotentials. Two have a Ferrers bar, two have a quadrupole bar and the last one\na composite bar.

The main focus of the work is on the construction\nof a metric on the parameter space for such signals for use in matched-filter\nbased searches. The metric is defined using a maximum likelihood detection\nstatistic applied to a binary orbit phase model including eccentricity. We find\nthat this metric can be accurately approximated by its diagonal form in the\nregime where the segment length is << the orbital period. Hence correlations\nbetween parameters are effectively removed by the combination of many\nindependent observation. We find that the ability to distinguish signal\nparameters is independent of the total semi-coherent observation span (for the\nsemi-coherent span >> the segment length) for all but the orbital angular\nfrequency. Increased template density for this parameter scales linearly with\nthe observation span. We also present two example search schemes.

In cosmology, it is used to quantify large-scale structure\n(LSS) and the cosmic microwave background (CMB). This is because the power\nspectrum completely quantifies Gaussian random fields, which the CMB and LSS\nfields seem to be at early epochs. However, at late epochs and small scales,\ncosmological density fields become highly non-Gaussian. The power spectrum\nloses power to describe LSS and CMB fields on small scales, most obviously\nthrough high covariance in the power spectrum as a function of scale.\nPractically, this significantly degrades constraints that observations can\nplace on cosmological parameters. However, if a nonlinear transformation that\nproduces a (more) Gaussian 1-point distribution is applied to a field, the\nextra covariance in the field's power spectrum can be dramatically reduced. In\nthe case of the roughly lognormal low-redshift matter density field, a log\ntransform accomplishes this.

Instead,\nthe local mean velocity field around each cell is reconstructed with a\nmulti-scale filtering technique, yielding the maximum scale of turbulent eddies\nby means of iterations. The method is robust, fast and easily applicable to any\ngrid simulation. We present here the application of this technique to the study\nof spatial and spectral properties of turbulence in the intra cluster medium,\nmeasuring turbulent diffusion and anisotropy of the turbulent velocity field\nfor a variety of driving mechanisms: a) accretion of matter in galaxy clusters\n(simulated with ENZO); b) sloshing motions around cool-cores (simulated with\nFLASH); c) jet outflows from active galactic nuclei, AGN (simulated with\nFLASH). The turbulent velocities driven by matter accretion in galaxy clusters\nare mostly tangential in the inner regions (inside the cluster virial radius)\nand isotropic in regions close to the virial radius. The same is found for\nturbulence excited by cool core sloshing, while the jet outflowing from AGN\ndrives mostly radial turbulence motions near its sonic point and beyond.\nTurbulence leads to a diffusivity in the range =10^29-10^30 cm^2/s in the intra\ncluster medium.

Using\nnumerical simulations we measure the velocity fields using a Delaunay\ntesselation and obtain an accurate prediction of the velocity divergence power\nspectrum on scales k < 1 hMpc^{-1}. We use this to update the model which is\nnow accurate to 2% for both P_{\\theta \\theta} and P_{\\theta \\delta} at z=0 on\nscales k <0.7 hMpc^{-1} and k <0.5 hMpc^{-1} respectively.

Because\nof the importance of this value in constraining the system evolution, we\ncomprehensively analyse all the available optical/UV/X eclipse times of this\nsource to investigate the origin of these discrepancies. We collected all\npreviously published X-ray eclipse times from 1977 to 2008, to which we added\nthe eclipse time observed by Suzaku in 2006. This point is very important to\ncover the time gap between the last RXTE eclipse time (taken in 2003) and the\nmost recent Chandra eclipse time (taken in 2008). Similarly we collected the\noptical/UV eclipse arrival times covering the period from 1979 to 2006, adding\na further eclipse time taken on 1978 and updating previous optical/UV\nephemeris. We compared the X-ray and the optical/UV ephemeris, and finally\nderived a new ephemeris of the source by combining the eclipse arrival times in\nthe X-ray and optical/UV bands. The X-ray eclipse time delays calculated with\nrespect to a constant orbital period model display a clear parabolic trend,\nconfirming that the orbital period of this source constantly increases at a\nrate of $\\dot{P}_{\\rm{orb}} =1.51(7) \\times 10^{-10}$ s/s. Combining the X-ray\nand the optical/UV data sets, we find that $\\dot{P}_{\\rm{orb}} =1.59(9) \\times\n10^{-10}$ s/s, which is compatible with the X-ray orbital solution. We also\ninvestigate the possible presence of a delay of the optical/UV eclipse with\nrespect to the X-ray eclipse, finding that this delay may not be constant in\ntime. In particular, this variation is compatible with a sinusoidal modulation\nof the optical/UV eclipse arrival times with respect to the long-term parabolic\ntrend. In this case, the optical/UV eclipse should lag the X-ray eclipse and\nthe time-lag oscillate about an average value. (Abridged) \n\n"}

Abstract: We investigate the large-scale clustering and gravitational interaction of\nbaryons and dark matter (DM) over cosmic time using a set of collisionless\nN-body simulations. Both components, baryons and DM, are evolved from distinct\nprimordial density and velocity power spectra as predicted by early-universe\nphysics. We first demonstrate that such two-component simulations require an\nunconventional match between force and mass resolution (i.e. force softening on\nat least the mean particle separation scale). Otherwise, the growth on any\nscale is not correctly recovered because of a spurious coupling between the two\nspecies at the smallest scales. With these simulations, we then demonstrate how\nthe primordial differences in the clustering of baryons and DM are\nprogressively diminished over time. In particular, we explicitly show how the\nBAO signature is damped in the spatial distribution of baryons and imprinted in\nthat of DM. This is a rapid process, yet it is still not fully completed at low\nredshifts. On large scales, the overall shape of the correlation function of\nbaryons and DM differs by 2% at z = 9 and by 0.2% at z = 0. The differences in\nthe amplitude of the BAO peak are approximately a factor of 5 larger: 10% at z\n= 9 and 1% at z = 0. These discrepancies are, however, smaller than effects\nexpected to be introduced by galaxy formation physics in both the shape of the\npower spectrum and in the BAO peak, and are thus unlikely to be detected given\nthe precision of the next generation of galaxy surveys. Hence, our results\nvalidate the standard practice of modelling the observed galaxy distribution\nusing predictions for the total mass clustering in the Universe. \n\n"}

The mass-size relations for galaxies classified as late-type,\nlow-n, and star-forming are consistent with each other, while blue galaxies\nfollow a somewhat steeper relation.

Supposing that a small fraction of colored objects\nescaped hadronization and survived up to now in the form of quark-gluon nuggets\n(QNs), and also taking into account radiation, we investigate scalar\nperturbations of the FRW metrics due to inhomogeneities of dustlike matter as\nwell as fluctuations of QNs and radiation.

This could either be due to a true divergence in orbital\nperiod distributions of these two types of system, or to black hole LMXBs being\npreferentially hidden from view at short orbital periods. We explore the latter\npossibility, by investigating whether black hole LMXBs could be concealed by a\nswitch to radiatively inefficient accretion at low luminosities. The peak\nluminosity and the duration of X-ray binary outbursts are related to the disc\nradius and, hence, the orbital period. At short periods, where the peak\noutburst luminosity drops close to the threshold for radiatively inefficient\naccretion, black hole LMXBs have lower outburst luminosities, shorter outburst\ndurations and lower X-ray duty cycles than comparable neutron star systems.\nThese factors can combine to severely reduce the detection probability of short\nperiod black hole LMXBs relative to those containing neutron stars. We estimate\nthe outburst properties and orbital period distribution of black hole LMXBs\nusing two models of the transition to radiatively inefficient accretion: an\ninstantaneous drop in accretion efficiency (eta) to zero, at a fraction (f) of\nthe Eddington luminosity (L_Edd) and a power-law efficiency decrease, eta\n\\propto \\dot{M}^n, for L < f*L_Edd.

We interpret this as a result of spectral ageing of CRe, which is\nsupported by the radio spectral index: data points dominated by young CRe are\nrelatively radio dim, those dominated by old CRe are relatively radio bright.\nThe ratio of radio to FUV/MIR-based integrated SFR is independent of global\ngalaxy parameters, suggesting that we can use RC emission as a universal SF\ntracer for galaxies, if we restrict ourselves to global or azimuthally averaged\nmeasurements.

In the search for short\nduration signals, such as coalescing compact binary inspirals or \"burst\"\nevents, noise transients can be problematic. Interferometric gravitational-wave\ndetectors are highly complex instruments, and, based on the experience from the\npast, the data often contain a large number of noise transients that are not\neasily distinguishable from possible gravitational-wave signals. In order to\nperform a sensitive search for short-duration gravitational-wave signals it is\nimportant to identify these noise artifacts, and to \"veto\" them. Here we\ndescribe such a veto, the bilinear-coupling veto, that makes use of an\nempirical model of the coupling of instrumental noise to the output strain\nchannel of the interferometric gravitational-wave detector. In this method, we\ncheck whether the data from the output strain channel at the time of an\napparent signal is consistent with the data from a bilinear combination of\nauxiliary channels.

However, the model predictions agree with\nthe observations for most bursts occurring in hard, low-luminosity, 'island'\nspectral states, but rarely during soft, high-luminosity, 'banana' states.

The evolution of the polar field is a consequence of Hale's\npolarity rules, together with the tilt angle distribution which has a\nsystematic component (Joy's law) and a random component (tilt-angle scatter).\nWe determine the scatter using the observed tilt angle data and study the\neffects of this scatter on the evolution of the solar surface field using SFT\nsimulations with flux input based upon the recorded sunspot groups. The tilt\nangle scatter is described in our simulations by a random component according\nto the observed distributions for different ranges of sunspot group size (total\numbral area). By performing simulations with a number of different realizations\nof the scatter we study the effect of the tilt angle scatter on the global\nmagnetic field, especially on the evolution of the axial dipole moment. The\naverage axial dipole moment at the end of cycle 17 (a medium-amplitude cycle)\nfrom our simulations was 2.73G. The tilt angle scatter leads to an uncertainty\nof 0.78 G (standard deviation).

The most common type of variability, the S Dor instability, occurs on\ntimescales of tens of years. During an S Dor outburst, the visual magnitude of\nthe star increases, while the bolometric magnitude stays approximately\nconstant. In this work, we investigate pulsation as a possible trigger for the\nS Dor type outbursts. We calculate the pulsations of envelope models using a\nnonlinear hydrodynamics code including a time-dependent convection treatment.\nWe initialize the pulsation in the hydrodynamic model based on linear\nnon-adiabatic calculations.

As a\nconsequence, our model can satisfy the observational lower bounds on fields in\nthe intergalactic medium, while providing a seed for the galactic dynamo, if\ninflation occurs at an energy scale ranging from $10^5$ to $10^{10}$ GeV.

The progenitor is a tight binary system composed by a\ncarbon-oxygen (CO) core and a neutron star (NS) companion. The explosion of the\nSN leads to hypercritical accretion onto the NS companion which reaches the\ncritical mass, hence inducing its gravitational collapse to a black hole (BH)\nwith consequent emission of the GRB. The first estimates of this process were\nbased on a simplified model of the binary parameters and the\nBondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion rate.

However, these methods are\nknown to produce poor results on idealized test problems, particularly at late\ntimes, after the particle trajectories have crossed. To investigate this, we\nhave performed a series of one- and two-dimensional \"Zel'dovich Pancake\"\ncalculations using the popular Particle-in-Cell (PIC) method. We find that PIC\ncan indeed converge on these problems provided the following modifications are\nmade. The first modification is to regularize the singular initial distribution\nfunction by introducing a small but finite artificial velocity dispersion. This\nprocess is analogous to artificial viscosity in compressible gas dynamics, and,\nas with artificial viscosity, the amount of regularization can be tailored so\nthat its effect outside of a well-defined region - in this case, the\nhigh-density caustics - is small. The second modification is the introduction\nof a particle remapping procedure that periodically re-expresses the dark\nmatter distribution function using a new set of particles. We describe a\nremapping algorithm that is third-order accurate and adaptive in phase space.\nThis procedure prevents the accumulation of numerical errors in integrating the\nparticle trajectories from growing large enough to significantly degrade the\nsolution. Once both of these changes are made, PIC converges at second order on\nthe Zel'dovich Pancake problem, even at late times, after many caustics have\nformed. Furthermore, the resulting scheme does not suffer from the unphysical,\nsmall-scale \"clumping\" phenomenon known to occur on the Pancake problem when\nthe perturbation wave vector is not aligned with one of the Cartesian\ncoordinate axes. \n\n"}

Of\nthe several possibilities for this bispectrum, the most commmon is the\nlocal-model bispectrum, which can be described as a spatial modulation of the\nsmall-scale (large-wavenumber) power spectrum by long-wavelength density\nfluctuations. While the local model predicts this spatial modulation to be\nscale-independent, many variants have some scale-dependence. Here we note that\nthis scale dependence can be probed with measurements of frequency-spectrum\ndistortions in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), in particular\nhighlighting Compton-$y$ distortions. Dissipation of primordial perturbations\nwith wavenumbers $50\\,{\\rm Mpc}^{-1} \\lesssim k \\lesssim 10^4\\,{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$\ngive rise to chemical-potential ($\\mu$) distortions, while those with\nwavenumbers $1\\,{\\rm Mpc}^{-1} \\lesssim k \\lesssim 50\\,{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ give\nrise to Compton-$y$ distortions.

Since hot star winds are driven by the light absorption in the\nlines of heavier elements, wind acceleration is sensitive to the ionization\nstate. Therefore, the over-ionization induced by external X-ray source strongly\ninfluences the winds of individual components. We studied the effect of\nexternal X-ray irradiation on hot star winds. We used our kinetic equilibrium\n(NLTE) wind models to estimate the influence of external X-ray ionization for\ndifferent X-ray luminosities and source distances. The models are calculated\nfor parameters typical of O stars. The influence of X-rays is given by the\nX-ray luminosity, by the optical depth between a given point and the X-ray\nsource, and by a distance to the X-ray source. Therefore, the results can be\ninterpreted in the diagrams of X-ray luminosity vs.~the optical depth\nparameter.

The\nfate of this dense wind material is important for models of second generation\nstar formation in massive star clusters. Mackey et al. (2014) showed that\nexternal photoionization can stall the wind of RSGs and accumulate mass in a\ndense static shell. We use 1D R-HD simulations of an externally photoionized\nwind to predict the Halpha and [NII] emission arising from photoionized winds\nboth with and without a dense shell. We analyse spectra of the Halpha and [NII]\nemission in the environment around W26 and compare them with predicted\nsynthetic emission. Simulations of slow winds that are decelerated into a dense\nshell show strongly limb-brightened line emission, with line radial velocities\nthat are independent of the wind speed. Faster winds (>22 km/s) do not form a\ndense shell, have less limb-brightening, and the line radial velocity is a good\ntracer of the wind speed. The brightness of the [NII] and Halpha lines as a\nfunction of distance from W26 agrees reasonably well with observations when\nonly the line flux is considered. The radial velocity disagrees, however: the\nbrightest observed emission is blueshifted by ~25 km/s relative to the radial\nvelocity of the star, whereas a spherically symmetric wind has the brightest\nemission at zero radial velocity. Our results show that the bright nebula\nsurrounding W26 must be asymmetric; we suggest it is confined by external ram\npressure from the wind of the nearby supergiant W9. We obtain a lower limit on\nthe nitrogen abundance within the nebula of 2.35 times solar.

Here we present the results from two\nstudies of HI (in absorption) and molecular gas illustrating what can be\nlearned from these phases of the gas. We first describe a statistical study\nwith the WSRT. The study shows that the young radio sources not only have an\nhigher detection rate of HI, but also systematically broader and more\nasymmetric HI profiles, most of them blueshifted. This supports the idea that\nwe are looking at young radio jets making their way through the surrounding\nISM, which also appears to be, on average, richer in gas than in evolved radio\nsources. Signatures of the impact of the jet are seen in the kinematics of the\ngas.

Abstract: The obliquities of planet-hosting stars are clues about the formation of\nplanetary systems.

First, Mazeh and coworkers\nrecently used a new technique -- based on the amplitude of starspot-induced\nphotometric variability -- to conclude that spin-orbit alignment is common even\nfor relatively long-period planets, which would not be expected if tides were\nresponsible. We re-examine the data and find a statistically significant\ncorrelation between photometric variability and planetary orbital period that\nis qualitatively consistent with tidal interactions. However it is still\ndifficult to explain quantitatively, as it would require tides to be effective\nfor periods as long as tens of days. Second, Rogers and Lin argued against a\nparticular theory for tidal re-alignment by showing that initially retrograde\nsystems would fail to be re-aligned, in contradiction with the observed\nprevalence of prograde systems. We investigate a simple model that overcomes\nthis problem by taking into account the dissipation of inertial waves and the\nequilibrium tide, as well as magnetic braking. We identify a region of\nparameter space where re-alignment can be achieved, but it only works for\nclose-in giant planets, and requires some fine tuning. Thus, while we find both\nproblems to be more nuanced than they first appeared, the tidal model still has\nserious shortcomings. \n\n"}

We use two-dimensional,\nradiation-hydrodynamics simulations of wind bubbles within HII regions around\nindividual stars to predict the infrared emission properties of the dust within\nthe HII region. We assume that dust and gas are dynamically well-coupled and\nthat dust properties (composition, size distribution) are the same in the HII\nregion as outside it, and that the wind bubble contains no dust. We\npost-process the simulations to make synthetic intensity maps at infrared\nwavebands using the TORUS code. We find that the outer edge of a wind bubble\nemits brightly at 24um through starlight absorbed by dust grains and\nre-radiated thermally in the infrared. This produces a bright arc of emission\nfor slowly moving stars that have asymmetric wind bubbles, even for cases where\nthere is no bow shock or any corresponding feature in tracers of gas emission.\nThe 24um intensity decreases exponentially from the arc with increasing\ndistance from the star because the dust temperature decreases with distance.\nThe size distribution and composition of the dust grains has quantitative but\nnot qualitative effects on our results. Despite the simplifications of our\nmodel, we find good qualitative agreement with observations of the HII region\nRCW120, and can provide physical explanations for any quantitative differences.\nOur model produces an infrared arc with the same shape and size as the arc\naround CD -38 11636 in RCW120, and with comparable brightness. This suggests\nthat infrared arcs around O stars in HII regions may be revealing the extent of\nstellar wind bubbles, although we have not excluded other explanations. \n\n"}

Abstract: In Keplerian accretion disks, turbulence and magnetic fields may be jointly\nexcited through a subcritical dynamo process involving the magnetorotational\ninstability (MRI). High-resolution simulations exhibit a tendency towards\nstatistical self-organization of MRI dynamo turbulence into large-scale cyclic\ndynamics. Understanding the physical origin of these structures, and whether\nthey can be sustained and transport angular momentum efficiently in\nastrophysical conditions, represents a significant theoretical challenge. The\ndiscovery of simple periodic nonlinear MRI dynamo solutions has recently proven\nuseful in this respect, and has notably served to highlight the role of\nturbulent magnetic diffusion in the seeming decay of the dynamics at low\nmagnetic Prandtl number Pm (magnetic diffusivity larger than viscosity), a\ncommon regime in accretion disks. The connection between these simple\nstructures and the statistical organization reported in turbulent simulations\nremained elusive, though. Here, we report the numerical discovery in moderate\naspect ratio Keplerian shearing boxes of new periodic, incompressible,\nthree-dimensional nonlinear MRI dynamo solutions with a larger dynamical\ncomplexity reminiscent of such simulations. These \"chimera\" cycles are\ncharacterized by multiple MRI-unstable dynamical stages, but their basic\nphysical principles of self-sustainment are nevertheless identical to those of\nsimpler cycles found in azimuthally elongated boxes. In particular, we find\nthat they are not sustained at low Pm either due to subcritical turbulent\nmagnetic diffusion. These solutions offer a new perspective into the transition\nfrom laminar to turbulent instability-driven dynamos, and may prove useful to\ndevise improved statistical models of turbulent accretion disk dynamos. \n\n"}

The presence of a baryonic disk together with\nwell-known dynamical processes (e.g. spiral structure and bar instabilities)\nincrease the dark matter density in the disk plane. We find that the magnitude\nof the combined stellar and shadow bar evolution, when isolated from the effect\nof the axisymmetric gravitational potential of the disk, accounts for >30% of\nthis overall increase in disk-plane density. This is significantly larger that\nof previously claimed deviations from the standard halo model. The dark-matter\ndensity and kinematic wakes driven by the Milky Way bar increase the\ndetectability of dark matter overall, especially for the experiments with\nhigher $v_{min}$. These astrophysical features increase the detection rate by\nmore than a factor of two when compared to the standard halo model and by a\nfactor of ten for experiments with high minimum recoil energy thresholds. These\nsame features increase (decrease) the annual modulation for low (high) minimum\nrecoil energy experiments. We present physical arguments for why these dynamics\nare generic for barred galaxies such as the Milky Way rather than contingent on\na specific galaxy model. \n\n"}

This IR luminosity cut\ncorresponds to $\\rm{log}\\,L_X \\approx 45$\\,erg\\,s$^{-1}$, at the median\nredshift of our sample ($z=2.3$), that lies at the bright end of the X-ray\nluminosity function at $z>2$. The X-ray spectroscopic analysis reveals seven\nobscured AGN having a column density $\\rm N_H>10^{22} cm^{-2}$. Six of them\nshow evidence for broad [CIV] absorption lines and five are classified as\nBALQSOs. We fit the optical spectra of our X-ray absorbed sources to estimate\nthe optical reddening. We find that none of these show any obscuration\naccording to the optical continuum. These sources add to the growing evidence\nfor populations of luminous QSOs with evidence for substantial absorption by\noutflowing ionised material, similar to those expected to be emerging from\ntheir absorbing cocoons in the framework of AGN/galaxy co-evolution. \n\n"}

For instance, the interaction\nbetween ions and neutrals through momentum transfer collisions causes the\ndamping of Alfv\\'en waves and alters their oscillation frequency and phase\nspeed. When the collision frequencies are larger than the frequency of the\nwaves, single-fluid magnetohydrodynamic approximations can accurately describe\nthe effects of partial ionization, since there is a strong coupling between the\nvarious species. However, at higher frequencies, the single-fluid models are\nnot applicable and more complex approaches are required.

In the former state, they are X-ray bright, in the latter X-ray\ndim. Soft X-ray transients (SXTs) undergo similar switches in X-ray, between\n\"high\" states with bright X-ray outbursts and a \"low\" state of quiescence. The\nupper limit on the quiescent X-ray luminosity of SXT 1H 1905+000 suggests that\nits luminosity might be similar to that of the known tMSPs. A detection of\nradio pulsations would link SXTs more strongly with tMSPs; and thus e.g. put\nstricter constraints on tMSP transitional timescales, through the connection\nwith the well-known SXT periods of quiescence. A non-detection allows us, based\non the telescope sensitivity, to estimate how likely these sources are to\npulsate in radio. Over a ten-year span, 2006-2015, we carried out targeted\nradio observations at 400/800 MHz with Arecibo, and searched for radio\npulsations from the quiescent SXT 1H 1905+000.

Using\nspecifically designed $N$-body simulations of GCs evolving in a variety of\ntime-dependent tidal fields (describing the potential of a dwarf galaxy-Milky\nWay merger), we analyze the effects imprinted to the internal kinematics of an\naccreted GC. In particular, we look at the evolution of the velocity\nanisotropy. Our simulations show that at early phases, the velocity anisotropy\nis determined by the tidal field of the dwarf galaxy and subsequently the\nclusters will adapt to the new tidal environment, losing any signature of their\noriginal environment in a few relaxation times. At 10 Gyr, GCs exhibit a\nvariety of velocity anisotropy profiles, namely, isotropic velocity\ndistribution in the inner regions and either isotropy or radial/tangential\nanisotropy in the intermediate and outer regions. Independently of an accreted\norigin, the velocity anisotropy primarily depends on the strength of the tidal\nfield cumulatively experienced by a cluster.

In each case, an understanding of the significance of the\npolarization signal requires well-calibrated physical models of dust grains.\nDespite decades of progress in theory and observation, polarized dust models\nremain largely underconstrained. During its 2012 flight, the balloon-borne\ntelescope BLASTPol obtained simultaneous broad-band polarimetric maps of a\ntranslucent molecular cloud at 250, 350, and 500 microns. Combining these data\nwith polarimetry from the Planck 850 micron band, we have produced a\nsubmillimeter polarization spectrum for a cloud of this type for the first\ntime. We find the polarization degree to be largely constant across the four\nbands. This result introduces a new observable with the potential to place\nstrong empirical constraints on ISM dust polarization models in a previously\ninaccessible density regime. Comparing with models by Draine and Fraisse\n(2009), our result disfavors two of their models for which all polarization\narises due only to aligned silicate grains. By creating simple models for\npolarized emission in a translucent cloud, we verify that extinction within the\ncloud should have only a small effect on the polarization spectrum shape\ncompared to the diffuse ISM.

A white noise power spectral density (PSD) is expected at low\nfrequency in this model, however, direct observational constraint to the low\nfrequency PSD slope is hard due to limited lengths of the light curves\navailable.

We take into account the effects of viscosity, which is likely to arise\nin the merger remnant due to magnetohydrodynamical turbulence. As the initial\ncondition, we employ the azimuthally averaged data of the MNS-torus system\nderived in a three-dimensional, numerical-relativity simulation for the binary\nneutron star merger. The viscous effect plays key roles for the remnant\nevolution and mass ejection from it in two phases of the evolution. In the\nfirst $t\\lesssim10$ ms, a differential rotation state of the MNS is changed to\na rigidly rotating state, and as a result, a sound wave, which subsequently\nbecomes a shock wave, is formed in the vicinity of the MNS due to the variation\nof the quasi-equilibrium state of the MNS. The shock wave induces significant\nmass ejection of mass $\\sim(0.5-2.0)\\times 10^{-2}M_\\odot$ for the alpha\nviscosity parameter of $0.01-0.04$. For the longer-term evolution with $\\sim\n0.1-10$ s, a significant fraction of the torus material is ejected.

The scatter in the simulated MZR contains a clear correlation with\nthe gas-mass or star formation rate of the system, in agreement with the\nobserved fundamental metallicity relation.

Using high-resolution $N$-body simulations, we model composite\nstellar discs, made of kinematically cold and hot stellar populations, and\nstudy their response to spiral arm perturbations. We find that, as expected,\ndisk populations with different kinematics respond differently to a spiral\nperturbation, with the tendency for dynamically cooler populations to show a\nlarger fractional contribution to spiral arms than dynamically hotter\npopulations. By assuming a relation between kinematics and metallicity, namely\nthe hotter the population, the more metal-poor it is, this differential\nresponse to the spiral arm perturbations naturally leads to azimuthal\nvariations in the mean metallicity of stars in the simulated disk.

The\nsource of this gas is not necessarily cosmic filaments. Rather, the dwarfs\ninteract with gas thrown off by nearby galaxy mergers or streams extending from\nneighboring galaxies. While high ram pressure interactions of this nature lead\nto stripping, the encounters that reignite star formation are low density\nand/or low velocity and thus low ram pressure, resulting in compression of the\nhot gas in the halos of our dwarfs.

However, it is essential that the General Relativity sector of\nthese templates accounts for all predictable physics. Otherwise, missing\nphysics might be mimicked by the \"beyond General Relativity\" sector of the\ntemplates, leading the analysis to report apparent deviations from General\nRelativity. Current parametrized tests implement templates that omit physical\nphenomena such as orbital eccentricity and higher-order modes. In this paper,\nwe show how the omission of higher modes can lead to false deviations from\nGeneral Relativity when these effects are strong enough.

NSs origin and evolution\nprovide a useful information on stellar dynamics and evolution in star\nclusters, and are among the most interesting astrophysical objects, being\nprecursors of several high-energy phenomena such as gravitational waves and\ngamma-ray bursts.

Thanks to the capability of the SoHO/MDI and SDO/HMI\ninstruments to observe with an unprecedented accuracy the surface gravity\noscillation (f) modes, it is possible to extract information concerning the\ncoefficients of rotational frequency splitting, a1, a3 and a5, that measure the\ndifferential rotation, together with the a2, a4 and a6 asphericity\ncoefficients. Analysis of these helioseismology data for almost two solar\ncycles, from 1996 to 2017, reveals a close correlation of the a1 and a5\ncoefficients with the solar activity, whilst a3 exhibits a long-term trend and\na weak correlation in the current cycle indicating a substantial change of the\nglobal rotation, potentially associated with a long-term evolution of the solar\ncycles. Looking in more details, the asphericity coefficients, a2, a4 and a6\nare more strongly associated with the solar cycle when applying a time lag of\nrespectively 0.1, 1.6 and -1.6 years. The magnitude of a6-coefficient varies in\nphase with the sunspot number (SN), but its amplitude is ahead of the SN\nvariation.

Further, the growth of coherent instability can\nbe attributed to the resonance observed between the cyclotron-resonant-excited\nwave and the background plasma oscillation. The particles can be injected into\nthe closed-field line regions owing to magnetic reconnection near a light\ncylinder. These particles introduce a large amount of free energy that further\ncauses cyclotron-resonant instability, which grows and amplifies radiative\nwaves at frequencies close to the electron cyclotron harmonics that exhibit\nzebra-pattern-like spectral band structures.

Although several plausible mechanisms for this elevated\nvelocity dispersion (e.g. star formation feedback, elevated gas supply, or more\nfrequent galaxy interactions) have been proposed, the fundamental driver of the\nvelocity dispersion enhancement at high redshift remains unclear. We\ninvestigate the origin of this kinematic evolution using a suite of\ncosmological simulations from the FIRE (Feedback In Realistic Environments)\nproject. Although IFS surveys generally cover a wider range of stellar masses\nthan in these simulations, the simulated galaxies show trends between intrinsic\nvelocity dispersion, SFR, and redshift in agreement with observations. In both\nthe observed and simulated galaxies, intrinsic velocity dispersion is\npositively correlated with SFR. Intrinsic velocity dispersion increases with\nredshift out to z~1 and then flattens beyond that.

In particular, we focus on the characterization of the\nnuclear activity. This analysis has been performed on rest-frame optical\nspectra taken with LBT-LUCI. The spectral coverage allowed us to observe\nemission lines such as Halpha, Hbeta, [Oiii]5007 A, and [Nii]6583 A at the z of\nthe central RG. We observed the central part of the protocluster, which is\nsuitable to include the radio galaxy, several spectroscopically confirmed AGN\nbelonging to the protocluster, and other objects that might be members of the\nprotocluster. For four previously identified protocluster members, we derived\nthe redshift by detecting emission lines that have never detected before for\nthese galaxies. The stacked spectrum of the galaxies in which we detected the\n[Oiii]5007 A emission line revealed the presence of the second line of the\n[Oiii] doublet at 4959 A and of Hbeta, which confirms that they belong to the\nprotocluster. By collecting all members identified so far in this work and\nother members from the literature, we defined 31 galaxies, including the\ncentral RG, around z = 1.4152 +/- 0.056, corresponding to peculiar velocities\n<~5000 km/s with respect to the RG. The PV phase-space diagram suggests that 3\nprotocluster AGN and the central RG might be a virialized population that has\nbeen coexisting for a long time in the densest core region of this forming\nstructure. This protocluster is characterized by a high fraction of AGN (23%).\nFor one of them, AGN1317, we produced 2 BPT diagrams. The high fraction of AGN\nand their distribution within the protocluster seem to be consistent with\npredictions of some theoretical models on AGN growth and feedback. \n\n"}

For a reasonable choice of parameters, thermal inflation\nmodels naturally predict a suppression of the matter power spectrum on galactic\nand sub-galactic scales, mimicking the effect of warm or interacting dark\nmatter. Matter power spectra in these models are also characterised by an\nexcess of power (w.r.t. the standard $\\Lambda$CDM power spectrum) just below\nthe suppression scale. By running a suite of N-body simulations we investigate\nthe non-linear growth of structure in models of thermal inflation. We measure\nthe non-linear matter power spectrum and extract halo statistics, such as the\nhalo mass function, and compare these quantities with those predicted in the\nstandard $\\Lambda$CDM model and in other models with damped matter\nfluctuations. We find that the thermal inflation models considered here produce\nmeasurable differences in the matter power spectrum from $\\Lambda$CDM at\nredshifts $z>5$, while the halo mass functions are appreciably different at all\nredshifts. The halo mass function at $z=0$ for thermal inflation displays an\nenhancement of around $\\sim 20\\%$ w.r.t. $\\Lambda$CDM and a damping at lower\nhalo masses, with the position of the enhancement depending on the value of the\nfree parameter in the model.

Recently, there has been a\nsurge in interest in examining the issue of primordial magnetogenesis in the\ncontext of bouncing universes. As in the case of inflation, the conformal\ninvariance of the electromagnetic action needs to be broken in bouncing\nscenarios in order to generate primordial magnetic fields which correspond to\nobserved strengths today. The non-minimal coupling, which typically depends on\na scalar field that possibly drives the homogeneous background, leads to a\ncross-correlation at the level of the three-point function between the\nperturbation in the scalar field and the magnetic fields. This has been studied\nin some detail in the context of inflation and, specifically, it has been\nestablished that the three-point function satisfies the so-called consistency\nrelation in the squeezed limit. In this work, we study the cross-correlation\nbetween the magnetic fields and the perturbation in an auxiliary scalar field\nin a certain class of bouncing scenarios. We consider couplings that lead to\nscale invariant spectra of the magnetic field and evaluate the corresponding\ncross-correlation between the magnetic field and the perturbation in the scalar\nfield. We find that, when compared to de Sitter inflation, the dimensionless\nnon-Gaussianity parameter that characterizes the amplitude of the\ncross-correlations proves to be considerably larger in bouncing scenarios. We\nalso show that the aforementioned consistency condition governing the\ncross-correlation is violated in the bouncing models. We discuss the\nimplications of our results. \n\n"}

In CW Tau, the total and\npolarized emission are both smooth and symmetric, with polarization angles\nalmost parallel to the minor axis of the projected disk. In contrast, DG Tau\ndisplays a structured polarized emission, with an elongated brighter region in\nthe disk's near side and a belt-like feature beyond about 0.\"3 from the source.\nAt the same time the total intensity is spatially smooth, with no features. The\npolarization pattern, almost parallel to the minor axis in the inner region,\nbecomes azimuthal in the outer belt, possibly because of a drop in optical\ndepth. The polarization fraction has average values of 1.2% in CW Tau and 0.4%\nin DG Tau. Our results are consistent with polarization from self-scattering of\nthe dust thermal emission.

First, in each cluster, averaged\nover the spread of age, we investigate how disk lifetime is dependent on\nstellar mass. The general relation in IC 348 and Orion A is that primordial\ndisks around intermediate mass stars (2--5$M_{\\odot}$) evolve faster than those\naround loss mass stars (0.1--1$M_{\\odot}$), which is consistent with previous\nresults. However, considering only low mass stars, we do not find a significant\ndependence of disk frequency on stellar mass. These results can help to better\nconstrain theories on gas giant planet formation timescales. Secondly, in the\nOrion A molecular cloud, in the mass range of 0.35--0.7$M_{\\odot}$, we provide\nthe most robust evidence to date for disk evolution within a single cluster\nexhibiting modest age spread. By using surface gravity as an age indicator and\nemploying 4.5 $\\mu m$ excess as a primordial disk diagnostic, we observe a\ntrend of decreasing disk frequency for older stars. The detection of\nintra-cluster disk evolution in NGC 1333 and IC 348 is tentative, since the\nslight decrease of disk frequency for older stars is a less than 1-$\\sigma$\neffect. \n\n"}

The scatter is uncorrelated with the\naccretion rate of the central galaxy's black hole (BH), but correlates strongly\nand negatively with the BH's mass, implicating differences in the expulsion of\ngas by active galactic nucleus feedback, throughout the assembly of the halo,\nas the main cause of scatter.

A quite natural explanation of this\nissue is given from the angle of higher-curvature gravity, both in four- and in\nfive-dimensional spacetime. The results here obtained reveal that the amplitude\nof the Kalb-Ramond field may be actually large and play a significant role\nduring the early universe, while the presence of higher-order gravity\nsuppresses this field during the cosmological evolution, so that it eventually\nbecomes negligible in the current universe. Besides the suppression of the\nKalb-Ramond field, the extra degree of freedom in $F(R)$ gravity, usually known\nas scalaron, also turns out to be responsible for inflation. Such F(R) gravity\nwith Kalb-Ramond fields may govern the early universe to undergo an\ninflationary stage at early times (with the subsequent graceful exit) for wider\nrange of F(R) gravity than without antisymmetric fields..

The force arising from\nthe release of energy into the ambient medium by the perturber, or heating\nforce, is directed along the direction of motion and induces an acceleration of\nthe perturber.

We\nconfirm the presence of generally steeper X-ray continua in narrow-line Seyfert\n1 galaxies (NLS1s) compared to broad-line Seyfert 1 galaxies. Seyfert 2\ngalaxies show photon indices similar to those of NLS1s. Whereas a tendency for\nan increasing X-ray luminosity with increasing interaction strength is found\nfor Seyfert 1 galaxies, such a correlation is not found for Seyfert 2 galaxies.\nFor Seyfert 1 galaxies we found also a strong correlation for increasing\nfar-infrared luminosity with increasing interaction strength.

We find the Ne absorption lines in the High Energy Grating spectrum to be\nresolved with FWHM=840{+490}{-360} km/s. We have used regions in the spectrum\nwhere no lines are expected to determine the X-ray continuum, and we model the\nabsorption and emission lines using photoionized-plasma calculations. The model\nconsists of two absorption components which have an order of magnitude\ndifference in their ionization parameters. The two components are spherically\noutflowing from the AGN and thus contribute to both the absorption and the\nemission via P Cygni profiles. The model also clearly requires O VII and O VIII\nabsorption edges. The low-ionization component of our model can plausibly\nproduce UV absorption lines with equivalent widths consistent with those\nobserved from NGC 3783.

F stars are of particular interest\nbecause the rest-frame near-UV spectra of the oldest known elliptical galaxies\nat z > 1 appear to be dominated by F stars near to the main-sequence turnoff.\n  We find that, in the case of the F stars, where the HST ultraviolet spectra\nhave high signal:noise, model-fitting with metallicity allowed to vary as a\nfree parameter is rather successful at deriving the correct metallicity. As a\nresult, the estimated turnoff ages of these stars yielded by the model fitting\nare well constrained. Encouraged by this we have fitted these same variable-\nmetallicity models to the deep, optical spectra of the z \\simeq 1.5 mJy radio\ngalaxies 53W091 and 53W069 obtained with the Keck telescope.

In any case, this result may be considered as the\nmost stringent estimate on an upper limit of a possible variation of \\mu (95%\nC.L.): \\[ |\\Delta \\mu / \\mu| < 8\\times 10^{-5} \\] This value serves as an\neffective tool for selection of models determining a relation between possible\ncosmological deviations of the fine-structure constant \\alpha and the\nelementary particle masses (m$_p$, m$_e$, etc.). \n\n"}

We argue that this type of\nsolution to both cosmological constant problems entails a number of definite\npredictions, which can be checked against upcoming observations. In particular,\nin models where the dark energy density is a discrete variable, or where it is\na continuous variable due to the potential energy of a single scalar field, the\nanthropic approach predicts that the dark energy equation of state is\n$p_D=-\\rho_D$ with a very high accuracy. It is also predicted that the dark\nenergy density is greater than the currently favored value $\\Omega_D\\approx\n0.7$.

We use 140 galaxies\nfrom 3 z<0.6 Abell clusters (A85,A496,A754 - spectroscopic membership) with\nblue colors, and compare them to 80 field galaxies with similar colors and\nluminosities. Our previous work (McIntosh et al. 2004, ApJ submitted) shows\nthat the blue galaxies in these local clusters are a recently infalling\npopulation that has yet to encounter the dense core. We quantify galaxy\ninternal structure from 2D B/D decompositions using GIM2D. We observe\nstructural differences between blue galaxies in clusters, compared to the\nfield. Most blue cluster members are physically smaller and fainter than their\nfield counterparts. At a matched size and luminosity, recent arrivals are\nsmoother in appearance, yet their total light is as disk-dominated as in normal\nfield spirals. Moreover, 50% of blue cluster galaxies have blue cores or\nglobally blue color profiles, in contrast with field spirals that have\ntypically red color gradients. Without environment dependent evolution outside\nof cluster cores, we expect blue disk galaxies in clusters and the field to\nhave similar morphologies, sizes, and color gradients. We show conclusively\nthat galaxy properties do reflect the environment in which the galaxy is found.\nThe data show that the transformation of accreted galaxies is not confined to\nthe dense cluster core. The overall properties of bluer cluster galaxies are\nbest explained by environment-driven transformation of accreted field spirals,\nand our results suggest that the processes that govern color and morphological\nevolution occur separately.

Many experiments are now in progress whose aim is detecting\nanisotropy and polarization of the CMB. Measurements of the CMB polarization\nare however hampered by the presence of polarized foregrounds, above all the\nsynchrotron emission of our Galaxy, whose importance increases as frequency\ndecreases and dominates the polarized diffuse radiation at frequencies below\nabout 50 GHz.

Their redshifts range from 0.3--1.0, with a median redshift 0.8. The\nslope of the relation shows no difference compared with the local slope.\nHowever, there is significant evolution in the zero-point offset; an offset due\nto evolution in magnitude requires a 2.4 magnitude luminosity brightening at\nz=1. We see little differences of the offset with bulge fraction, which is a\ngood surrogate for galaxy type. Correcting for the luminosity evolution reduces\nthe orthogonal scatter in the Fundamental Plane to 8%, consistent with the\nlocal scatter. This scatter is measured for our sample, and does not include\nresults from other studies which may have different selection effects. The\ndifference in the degree of evolution between our field sample and published\ncluster galaxies suggests a more recent formation epoch--around z=1.5 for field\ngalaxies compared to z>2.0 for cluster galaxies. The magnitude difference\nimplies that the field early-type galaxies are about 2 Gyr younger than the\ncluster ellipticals using standard single-burst models.

We extend the\nstudy of this enigmatic population up to higher redshifts and larger look-back\ntimes than has been possible before, finding that the fraction of optically\nluminous galaxies exhibiting luminous off-nuclear sources at z~0.1 is larger\nthan at the current time (~36% versus ~8%). The X-ray luminosities of the GOODS\noff-nuclear X-ray sources are comparable to or slightly greater than the\nintegrated point-source X-ray luminosities of nearby galaxies, providing a\npossible constraint on the X-ray Luminosity Function at higher star-formation\nrates. X-ray variability demonstrates that several of these sources are likely\nsingle accreting black holes; for the majority, however, the number of X-ray\ncounts is too low for X-ray variability studies. \n\n"}

We consider caustic crossings of a rotating star, an\noblate giant extrasolar planet, and an inclined standard thin accretion disk,\nand find the following results. (1) If most stars have rotation periods similar\nto chromospherically-active (i.e. spotted) giant stars in the bulge, than ~15%\nshould be sufficiently oblate (e>0.25) to produce detectable (>1%) deviations\nwith current observations. The form of the deviation due to ellipticity is\nqualitatively similar to that due to limb-darkening. Thus stellar oblateness\nmay have to be taken into account in interpretations of precise limb-darkening\nmeasurements with microlensing. (2) Giant planets will generally not produce a\ndetectable oblateness signal, either because they rotate too slowly (if they\nare close-in and tidally locked), or because they are too faint (if they are\nfarther away from the parent star). (3) There is a near-degeneracy between\nellipticity and position angle for equal-area sources with scale-free intensity\nprofiles and elliptical isophotes.

The most\nimportant effect is that of high column density absorbers with damping wings,\nwhich add power on large scales. We compute their effect using the\nobservational constraints on their abundance as a function of column density.\nIgnoring their effect leads to an underestimation of the slope of the linear\ntheory power spectrum. The second effect we investigate is that of fluctuations\nin the ionizing radiation field. For this purpose we use a very large high\nresolution N-body simulation, which allows us to simulate both the fluctuations\nin the ionizing radiation and the small scale LyaF within the same simulation.\nWe find an enhancement of power on large scales for quasars and a suppression\nfor galaxies.

We develop templates which can be used to search for this effect\nas a function of quasar lifetime, quasar luminosity function, and attenuation\nlength.

By stacking all undetected DRGs we find that\ntheir average X-ray flux in the 0.5-8 keV band is ~4.6x10^-17 ergs/s/cm^2. The\ndetection is only significant in the soft and full energy bands. The mean\ndetection may result from star formation, the presence of low luminosity AGN,\nor a combination of both.

Special\nrelativistic aberration due to the orbital motion of pulsar changes both the\nlongitude and colatitude of the emission direction with respect to the pulsar\nspin axis. The former gives rise to a shift of the arrival time of the pulse\ncentroid (this is the conventional ``longitudinal'' aberration delay), the\nlatter results in a distortion (contraction or dilation) of the pulse profile\non the orbital timescale. The amplitude of pulse distortion depends inversely\non the variation of polarization position angle across the pulse. For small\nangle between the pulsar magnetic and spin axes, as inferred for PSR\nJ0737-3039A from polarimetric observations, the pulse distortion is significant\n(\\sim 1%) and the associated ``latitudinal'' aberration delay is much larger\nthan the longitudinal one. By monitoring the arrival time of separate pulse\ncomponents as a function of pulsar orbital phase, the latitudinal aberration\ndelay may be easily measured with the current timing precision, thus\nconstraining the spin geometry of the system. The latitudinal delay can also be\ndetected by monitoring system's orbital parameters on the geodetic precession\ntimescale. Because of the near edge-on orbital orientation of the PSR\nJ0737-3039 system, general relativistic bending of pulsar A's radio beam near\nits superior conjunction also introduces spin-dependent time delays of similar\norder of magnitude as the aberration delays. In addition, light bending splits\nthe pulse profile into two variable components, corresponding to two\ngravitationally lensed images of the source. Detection of lensing effects is\nchallenging, but may be possible with existing technology. \n\n"}

In all cases, we have adopted a multi-phase description\nof the interstellar medium and modelled star formation in quiescent and burst\nmodes. We have explored two triggers for starbursts: strong shocks and high gas\ndensity, allowing for the possibility that stars in the burst may form with a\ntop-heavy initial mass function. We find that the final morphology of the\ngalaxy is extremely sensitive to the modelling of star formation and feedback.\nStarting from identical initial conditions, galaxies spanning the wide range of\nHubble types, with B-band disc-to-total luminosity ratios ranging from 0.25 to\n0.9, can form in the same dark matter halo. Models in which starbursts are\ninduced by high gas density (qualitatively similar to models in which feedback\nis produced by AGN) generate energetic winds and result in galaxies with an\nearly-type morphology. Models in which the starbursts are induced by strong\nshocks lead to extended discs. In this case, the feedback associated with the\nbursts suppresses the collapse of baryons in small halos, helping to create a\nreservoir of hot gas that is available for cooling after $z = 1$, following the\nbulk of the dynamical activity that builds up the halo.

The need for such reevaluation is\nfueled not only by the failure of searches thus far, but also by great advances\nrecently made in astrophysics, astrobiology, computer science and future\nstudies, which have remained largely ignored in SETI practice. As an example of\nthe new approach, we consider the effects of the observed metallicity and\ntemperature gradients in the Milky Way on the spatial distribution of\nhypothetical advanced extraterrestrial intelligent communities. While,\nobviously, properties of such communities and their sociological and\ntechnological preferences are entirely unknown, we assume that (1) they operate\nin agreement with the known laws of physics, and (2) that at some point they\ntypically become motivated by a meta-principle embodying the central role of\ninformation-processing; a prototype of the latter is the recently suggested\nIntelligence Principle of Steven J.

The internal attenuation is estimated using three\nindependent indicators, namely: the ratio of the total infrared to\nfar-ultraviolet emission, the ultraviolet spectral slope beta and the Balmer\ndecrement. We confirm that normal galaxies follow a L_TIR/L_FUV-beta relation\noffset from the one observed for starburst galaxies.

We study the correlations of dust attenuation with other\nglobal properties, such as the metallicity, dynamical mass, ionized gas\nattenuation, Halpha emission and mass surface density. Metal-rich, massive\ngalaxies are, as expected, more heavily extinguished in the UV than are small\nsystems. For the same gas metallicity normal galaxies have lower L_TIR/L_FUV\nratio than starbursts, in agreement with the difference observed in the\nL_TIR/L_FUV-beta relation.

This is inconsistent with estimates from\ngalactic HII regions. The origin of the discrepancy is unclear.\n  The anomalous emission associated with dust is clearly detected in most of\nthe 15 fields studied; it correlates well with the Finkbeiner et al. model 8\npredictions (FDS8) at 94 GHz, with an effective spectral index between 20 and\n60GHz of -2.85. Furthermore, the emissivity varies by a factor of ~2 from cloud\nto cloud. A modestly improved fit to the anomalous dust at K-band is provided\nby modulating the template by an estimate of the dust colour temperature,\nspecifically FDS8*T^n. We find a preferred value n~1.6.\n  The synchrotron emission steepens between GHz frequencies and the WMAP bands.\nThere are indications of spectral index variations across the sky but the\ncurrent data are not precise enough to accurately quantify this from region to\nregion. Our analysis of the WMAP data indicates strongly that the\ndust-correlated emission at the low WMAP frequencies has a spectrum which is\ncompatible with spinning dust; we find no evidence for a synchrotron component\ncorrelated with dust (abridged). \n\n"}

Abstract: A new candidate of cold dark matter arises by a novel elementary particle\nmodel: the almostcommutative AC-geometrical framework. Two heavy leptons are\nadded to the Standard Model, each one sharing a double opposite electric charge\nand an own lepton flavor number The novel mathematical theory of\nalmost-commutative geometry [1] wishes to unify gauge models with gravity. In\nthis scenario two new heavy (m_L>100GeV), oppositely double charged leptons\n(A,C),(A with charge -2 and C with charge +2), are born with no twin quark\ncompanions. The model naturally involves a new U(1) gauge interaction,\npossessed only by the AC-leptons and providing a Coulomblike attraction between\nthem.

The efficiency of this process, $\\epsilon_\\gamma$, is one of the\ncritical factors in any GRB model. The X-ray afterglow light curves of Swift\nGRBs show an early stage of flat decay. This has been interpreted as reflecting\nenergy injection. When combined with previous estimates, which have concluded\nthat the kinetic energy of the late ($\\gtrsim 10$ hr) afterglow is comparable\nto the energy emitted in gamma-rays, this interpretation implies very high\nvalues of $\\epsilon_\\gamma \\gtrsim 0.9$. Such a high efficiency is hard to\nreconcile with most models, including in particular the popular internal-shocks\nmodel. We re-analyze the derivation of the kinetic energy from the afterglow\nX-ray flux and re-examine the resulting estimates of the efficiency. We confirm\nthat, if the flatt decay arises from energy injection and the pre-Swift\nbroad-band estimates of the kinetic energy are correct, then $\\epsilon_\\gamma\n\\gtrsim 0.9$. We point out, however, that another interpretation of the\nflattish decay - a variable X-ray afterglow efficiency (e.g., due to a time\ndependence of afterglow shock microphysical parameters) - is possible. We also\nshow that direct estimates of the kinetic energy from the late X-ray afterglow\nflux are sensitive to the assumed values of the shock microphysical parameters\nand suggest that broad-band afterglow fits might have underestimated the\nkinetic energy (e.g., by overestimating the fraction of electrons that are\naccelerated to relativistic energies). Either one of these possibilities\nimplies a lower gamma-ray efficiency, and their joint effect could conceivably\nreduce the estimate of the typical $\\epsilon_\\gamma$ to $\\sim 0.1-0.5$. \n\n"}

In very\nmassive (140-260 solar mass) stars, much of the pressure support comes from the\nradiation field, meaning that they are loosely bound, with an adiabatic\ncoefficient that is close to the minimum stable value. Near the end of C/O\nburning, the central temperature increases to the point that photons begin to\nbe converted into electron-positron pairs, softening gamma below this critical\nvalue. The result is a runaway collapse, followed by explosive burning that\ncompletely obliterates the star. While these explosions can be up to 100 times\nmore energetic that core collapse and Type Ia supernovae, their peak\nluminosities are only slightly greater. However, due both to copious Ni-56\nproduction and hydrogen recombination, they are brighter much longer, and\nremain observable for ~ 1 year. Since metal enrichment is a local process,\nPPSNe should occur in pockets of metal-free gas over a broad range of\nredshifts, greatly enhancing their detectability, and distributing their\nnucleosyntehtic products about the Milky Way. This means that measurements of\nthe abundances of metal-free stars should be thought of as directly\nconstraining these objects. It also means that ongoing supernova searches,\nalready provide weak constraints for PPSN models.

We present a possible explanation for the formation and\nconfinement of such rings in optically thin circumstellar disks, without\ninvoking shepherding planets. If an enhancement of dust grains (e.g., due to a\ncatastrophic collision) occurs somewhere in the disk, photoelectric emission\nfrom the grains can heat the gas to temperatures well above that of the dust.\nThe gas orbits with super(sub)-Keplerian speeds inward (outward) of the\nassociated pressure maximum. This tends to concentrate the grains into a narrow\nregion. The rise in dust density leads to further heating and a stronger\nconcentration of grains. A narrow dust ring forms as a result of this\ninstability. We show that this mechanism not only operates around early-type\nstars that have high UV fluxes, but also around stars with spectral types as\nlate as K. This implies that this process is generic and may have occurred\nduring the lifetime of each circumstellar disk. We examine the stringent\nupper-limit on the H2 column density in the HR 4796A disk and find it to be\ncompatible with the presence of a significant amount of hydrogen gas in the\ndisk.

As described in a previous paper, 9 of these 20 galaxies\nhave strongly suppressed star formation and no detected emission lines.

The AGN host galaxies have stellar populations ranging from\nevolved to star-forming. Combining our sample with a UV-selected galaxy sample\nat the same redshift that spans a broader range in stellar mass, we find that\nblack-hole accretion is more effective at the high-mass end of the galaxy\ndistribution (~2.9x10^11 Msun) at z~2.3.

As the X-ray flux increases, the source tends to become\nless variable, and the QPO frequency increases rapidly, from 82 mHz to 4 Hz,\nover the flux (2-50 keV) range of 1.73-5.75 x 10^{-8} ergs cm^{-2} s^{-1}. The\namplitude of the fundamental component of the QPO varies little, while that of\nthe harmonic follows a decreasing trend. The fundamental component strengthens\ntoward high energies, while its harmonic weakens. Initially, the power spectrum\nis roughly flat at low frequencies and turns into a power law at high\nfrequencies, with the QPO harmonic sitting roughly at the break. In later\nobservations, however, the high-frequency portion of the continuum can actually\nbe better described by a broken power law (as opposed to a simple power law).\nThis effect becomes more apparent at higher energies. The overall amplitude of\nthe continuum shows a similar energy dependence to that of the fundamental\ncomponent of the QPO. Strong rapid X-ray variability, as well as hard energy\nspectrum, makes XTE J1550-564 a good black hole candidate.

We consider\nhow these affect power spectrum determinations from galaxy and weak-lensing\nsurveys. Non-Gaussian effects not only increase the individual error bars\ncompared to the Gaussian case but, most importantly, lead to non-trivial\ncross-correlations between different band-powers. We calculate the\npower-spectrum covariance matrix in non-linear perturbation theory (weakly\nnon-linear regime), in the hierarchical model (strongly non-linear regime), and\nfrom numerical simulations in real and redshift space. We discuss the impact of\nthese results on parameter estimation from power spectrum measurements and\ntheir dependence on the size of the survey and the choice of band-powers. We\nshow that the non-Gaussian terms in the covariance matrix become dominant for\nscales smaller than the non-linear scale, depending somewhat on power\nnormalization. Furthermore, we find that cross-correlations mostly deteriorate\nthe determination of the amplitude of a rescaled power spectrum, whereas its\nshape is less affected. In weak lensing surveys the projection tends to reduce\nthe importance of non-Gaussian effects. Even so, for background galaxies at\nredshift z=1, the non-Gaussian contribution rises significantly around l=1000,\nand could become comparable to the Gaussian terms depending upon the power\nspectrum normalization and cosmology. The projection has another interesting\neffect: the ratio between non-Gaussian and Gaussian contributions saturates and\ncan even decrease at small enough angular scales if the power spectrum of the\n3D field falls faster than 1/k^2. \n\n"}

How does this resonance affect the distribution function in the outer\nparts of a barred disk, and can we identify any effect of the resonance in the\nvelocity distribution f(v) actually observed in the solar neighborhood? To\nanswer these questions, detailed simulations of f(v) in the outer parts of an\nexponential stellar disks with nearly flat rotation curves and a rotating\ncentral bar have been performed. For a model resembling the old stellar disk,\nthe OLR causes a distinct feature in f(v) over a significant fraction of the\nouter disk. For positions <2kpc outside the OLR radius and at bar angles of\n\\~10-70 degrees, f(v) inhibits a bi-modality between the low-velocity stars\nmoving like the local standard of rest (LSR) and a secondary mode of stars\npredominantly moving outward and rotating more slowly than the LSR.\n  Such a bi-modality is indeed present in f(v) inferred from the Hipparcos data\nfor late-type stars in the solar neighborhood.

We have used extensive Monte Carlo\nsimulations to define the detection thresholds for our algorithm, to measure\nthe effective area of the EDCCII and to determine our spurious detection rate.\nThese simulations have shown that our detection efficiency is strongly\ncorrelated with the presence of large-scale structure in the EDSGC data which\nwe believe is due to the assumption of a flat, uniform background. Using these\nsimulations, we are able to compute the space density of clusters in this new\nsurvey. We find 83.5 10-6 h-3 Mpc-3 for 100<= R_m < 200 (Lambda_cl~20) systems,\n10.1 10-6 h-3 Mpc-3 for 200 <= R_m < 400 (Lambda_cl~40) systems and 2.3 10-6\nh-3 Mpc-3 for R_m > 400 (Lambda_cl > 80) systems.

This allows\nus to classify the f(R) models into four general classes, depending on the\nexistence of a standard matter epoch and on the final accelerated stage. The\nexistence of a viable matter dominated epoch prior to a late-time acceleration\nrequires that the variable m satisfies the conditions m(r) approx+0 and\ndm/dr>-1 at r approx-1. For the existence of a viable late-time acceleration we\nrequire instead either (i) m=-r-1, (sqrt{3}-1)/2<m<1 and dm/dr<-1 or (ii) 0<m<1\nat r=-2.

In particular, any relationship between the\nHubble constant and the energy density on our brane is possible, including (but\nnot only) FRW.

The presence of\na fundamental scale suggests that local Lorentz invariance may be violated at\nsufficiently high energies. Motivated by this possibility, recently, different\nmodels that violate Lorentz invariance locally have been used to evaluate the\ntrans-Planckian corrections to the inflationary density perturbation spectrum.\nHowever, certain astrophysical observations seem to indicate that local Lorentz\ninvariance may be preserved to extremely high energies. In such a situation, to\nstudy the trans-Planckian effects, it becomes imperative to consider models\nthat preserve local Lorentz invariance even as they contain a fundamental\nscale. In this work, we construct one such model and evaluate the resulting\nspectrum of density perturbations in the power-law inflationary scenario.
