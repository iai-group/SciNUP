Two data taking runs, at the wavelength of 1064\nnm, have been performed in the new configuration with magnetic field strengths\nof 2.3 T and 5 T. The 2.3 T field value was chosen in order to avoid stray\nfields. The new observations do not show the presence of a rotation signal down\nto the levels of $1.2\\cdot 10^{-8}$ rad at 5 T and $1.0\\cdot 10^{-8}$ rad at\n2.3 T (at 95% c.l.) with 45000 passes in the magnetic field zone.

Abstract: The time-tested BCS theory of superconductivity is generally accepted to be\nthe correct theory of conventional superconductivity by physicists and, by\nextension, by the world at large. In a different realm of human activity, until\nvery recently Bernard Madoff's time-tested investment operation was generally\naccepted as true and legitimate in the financial world. Madoff's Ponzi scheme,\nwhere old investors were being paid off by funds contributed by new investors,\nwas fundamentally flawed, yet was able to thrive for decades because of many\nvested interests. `Red flags' suggesting its illegitimacy were ignored. Here I\nsuggest that the same is true of BCS theory. There are an increasing number of\n`red flags' that strongly suggest the possibility that BCS theory may be\nfundamentally flawed. For example, an ever-growing number of superconductors\nare being classified as `unconventional', not described by the conventional BCS\ntheory and each requiring a different physical mechanism. In addition, I argue\nthat BCS theory is unable to explain the Meissner effect, $the$ most\nfundamental property of superconductors.

This contradiction could be solved if the form factor\nF^{B_s K} is smaller than the light cone sum rules estimation or the \"tree\"\namplitude has been over estimated in QCDF.

It has earlier been proposed that UHECRs could be\naccelerated in either the nucleus or the outer lobes of the nearby radio galaxy\nCen A. We show that UHECR production at a spatially intermediate location about\n15 kpc northeast from the nucleus, where the jet emerging from the nucleus is\nobserved to strike a large star-forming shell of gas, is a plausible\nalternative. A relativistic jet is capable of accelerating lower-energy heavy\nseed cosmic rays (CRs) to UHECRs on timescales comparable to the time it takes\nthe jet to pierce the large gaseous cloud. In this model many CRs arising from\na starburst, with a composition enhanced in heavy elements near the knee region\naround PeV, are boosted to ultra-high energies by the relativistic shock of a\nnewly oriented jet. This model matches the overall spectrum shown by the Auger\ndata and also makes a prediction for the chemical composition as a function of\nparticle energy. We thus predict an observable anisotropy in the composition at\nhigh energy in the sense that lighter nuclei should preferentially be seen\ntoward the general direction of Cen A. Taking into consideration the magnetic\nfield models for the Galactic disk and a Galactic magnetic wind, this scenario\nmay resolve the discrepancy between HiRes and Auger results concerning the\nchemical composition of UHECRs. \n\n"}

Abstract: Wrong Monte-Carlo computations are used to study the propagation of light in\nlow pressure gas of nebulae.\n  We recall that the incoherent interactions required for Monte Carlo\ncalculations and hindering coherent interactions are due to collisions that\ndisappear at low pressure. Incoherent interactions blur the images while\ncoherent do not. We introduce coherent optical effects or substitute them for\nMonte Carlo calculations in published papers, improving the results and\navoiding the introduction of \"new physics\".\n  The spectral radiance of novae has the magnitude of the radiance of lasers,\nand large column densities are available in the nebulae. Several types of\ncoherent interactions (superradiance, multiphoton effects, etc..), well studied\nusing lasers, work in nebulae as in laboratories.\n  The relatively thin shell of plasma containing atoms around a Str\\^omgren\nsphere is superradiant, so that the limb of the sphere is seen as a circle\nwhich may be dotted into an even number of \"pearls\".

We address the question of the lowest\nallowed flavor symmetry scale consistent with data. Because of the mechanism\nrecently pointed out by Grinstein et al. tree-level flavor changing neutral\ncurrents turn out to play a very weak constraining role. The same occurs, in\nour model, for electroweak precision observables. The main constraint turns out\nto come from WR-mediated flavor changing neutral current box diagrams,\nprimarily K - Kbar mixing. In the case where discrete parity symmetry is\npresent at the TeV scale, this constraint implies lower bounds on the mass of\nvectorlike fermions and flavor bosons of 5 and 10 TeV respectively. However,\nthese limits are weakened under the condition that only SU(2)_R x U(1)_{B-L} is\nrestored at the TeV scale, but not parity. For example, assuming the SU(2)\ngauge couplings in the ratio gR/gL approx 0.7 allows the above limits to go\ndown by half for both vectorlike fermions and flavor bosons. Our model provides\na framework for accommodating neutrino masses and, in the parity symmetric\ncase, provides a solution to the strong CP problem. The bound on the lepton\nflavor gauging scale is somewhat stronger, because of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis\nconstraints. We argue, however, that the applicability of these constraints\ndepends on the mechanism at work for the generation of neutrino masses. \n\n"}

The Yukawa couplings of the triplet fermion and the\nleft-handed neutrinos with the doublet Higgs field produce the Dirac mass\nterms. Together with the Majorana masses for the leptonic triplets, the light\nneutrinos obtain non-zero seesaw masses. We point out that it is also possible\nto have a quadruplet Higgs field to produce the Dirac mass terms to facilitate\nthe seesaw mechanism. The vacuum expectation value of the quadruplet Higgs is\nconstrained to be small by electroweak precision data. Therefore the Yukawa\ncouplings of a quadruplet can be much larger than those for a doublet.

However, the number of particles obtained from the Cooper-Frye\nformula is not always positive-definite.

The current experiments combine two different techniques, an array\nof surface detectors and fluorescence telescopes. The latter allow an almost\ncalorimetric measurement of the primary energy. Thus, hadron-initiated showers\ndetected by both type of detectors are used to calibrate the energy estimator\nfrom the surface array (usually the interpolated signal at a certain distance\nfrom the shower core S(r0)) with the primary energy. On the other hand, this\ncalibration is not feasible when searching for photon primaries since no high\nenergy photon has been unambiguously detected so far. Therefore, pure Monte\nCarlo parametrizations are used instead.\n  In this work, we present a new method to determine the primary energy of\nhadron-induced showers in a hybrid experiment based on a technique previously\ndeveloped for photon primaries. It consists on a set of calibration curves that\nrelate the surface energy estimator, S(r0), and the depth of maximum\ndevelopment of the shower, Xmax, obtained from the fluorescence telescopes.\nThen, the primary energy can be determined from pure surface information since\nS(r0) and the zenith angle of the incoming shower are only needed. Considering\na mixed sample of ultra-high energy proton and iron primaries and taking into\naccount the reconstruction uncertainties and shower to shower fluctuations, we\ndemonstrate that the primary energy may be determined with a systematic\nuncertainty below 1% and resolution around 16% in the energy range from\n10^{18.5} to 10^{19.6} eV.

Abstract: Tribrid inflation is a variant of supersymmetric hybrid inflation in which\nthe inflaton is a matter field (which can be charged under gauge symmetries)\nand inflation ends by a GUT-scale phase transition of a waterfall field. These\nfeatures make tribrid inflation a promising framework for realising inflation\nwith particularly close connections to particle physics. Superpotentials of\ntribrid inflation involve effective operators suppressed by some cutoff scale,\nwhich is often taken as the Planck scale. However, these operators may also be\ngenerated by integrating out messenger superfields with masses below the Planck\nscale, which is in fact quite common in GUT and/or flavour models. The values\nof the inflaton field during inflation can then lie above this mass scale,\nwhich means that for reliably calculating the model predictions one has to go\nbeyond the effective theory description. We therefore discuss realisations of\neffective theories of tribrid inflation and specify in which cases effects from\nthe messenger fields are expected, and under which conditions they can safely\nbe neglected. In particular, we point out how to construct realisations where,\ndespite the fact that the inflaton field values are above the messenger mass\nscale, the predictions for the observables are (to a good approximation)\nidentical to the ones calculated in the effective theory treatment where the\nmessenger mass scale is identified with the (apparent) cutoff scale. \n\n"}

We study the probe of new physics\nscales from the electroweak precision observables (EWPO) and the Higgs\nobservables (HO) at the future $e^+e^-$ Higgs factory (such as CEPC).

As\ndeviations from the SM are generally small, we can expand the new physics\nparameters up to linear order and perform an analytical $\\chi^2$ fit to derive\nthe potential reach of the new physics scales.

We therefore explore\nconservation of the quasi-local Misner-Sharp energy within the causal horizon,\nwhich, as we argue, is necessarily an apparent horizon.

Its conservation, however,\nyields \"empty\" de Sitter (open, flat, closed) as single cosmological solution,\nwhere Misner-Sharp total energy acts as cosmological constant and where the\nsource of curvature energy is unidentified. It is argued that de Sitter is only\napparently empty of matter.

The\nMulti-Parton Interactions (MPI) is a UE observable, where several interactions\noccur at the partonic level in a single $p+p$ event. This leads to dependence\nof particle production on event multiplicity. If the MPI occurs in a harder\nscale, there will be a correlation between the yield of quarkonia and total\ncharged particle multiplicity.

In\norder to formulate the factorization near threshold in SCET, we should include\nan additional degree of freedom with small energy, collinear to the beam\ndirection. The corresponding collinear-soft mode is included to describe the\nparton distribution function (PDF) near threshold. The soft function is\nmodified by subtracting the contribution of the collinear-soft modes in order\nto avoid double counting on the overlap region. As a result, the proper soft\nfunction becomes infrared finite, and all the factorized parts are free of\nrapidity divergence. Furthermore, the separation of the relevant scales in each\nfactorized part becomes manifest. We apply the same idea to the dihadron\nproduction in $e^+ e^-$ annihilation near threshold, and show that the\nresultant soft function is also free of infrared and rapidity divergences. \n\n"}

Due to the low Standard Model background, these final states are\nparticularly adapted to searches for gluinos or third generation squarks in\nseveral supersymmetric production topologies determined from a variety of\nsimplified and phenomenological models. The absence of excess over the Standard\nModel prediction is interpreted in terms of limits on the masses of\nsuperpartners derived at 95% confidence level. In the studied decay modes and\ndepending on the decay topology, the existence of gluinos with masses below 1.9\nTeV, sbottoms with masses below 700 GeV, and neutralinos with masses below 1.2\nTeV are excluded. \n\n"}

We discuss a model with a fermion coupled to a\ndark photon, with various mass relations in the dark sector; millicharged\nparticles; dark-sector fermions with inelastic transitions; the hadronic QCD\naxion; and an axion-like particle that couples to Standard Model fermions with\ncouplings proportional to their mass. In the fermion cases, we develop a new\ndiagnostic for assessing when such a particle is trapped at large mixing\nangles. Our bounds for a fermion coupled to a dark photon constrain small\ncouplings and masses <200 MeV, and do not decouple for low fermion masses. They\nexclude parameter space that is otherwise unconstrained by existing\naccelerator-based and direct-detection searches. In addition, our bounds are\ncomplementary to proposed laboratory searches for sub-GeV dark matter, and do\nnot constrain several \"thermal\" benchmark-model targets. For a millicharged\nparticle, we exclude charges between 10^(-9) to a few times 10^(-6) in units of\nthe electron charge; this excludes parameter space to higher millicharges and\nmasses than previous bounds.

Abstract: It has recently been suggested that the parity doublet structure seen in the\nspectrum of highly excited baryons may be due to effective chiral symmetry\nrestoration for these states. We review the recent developments in this field.\nWe demonstrate with a simple quantum-mechanical example that it is a very\nnatural property of quantum systems that a symmetry breaking effect which is\nimportant for the low-lying spectrum of the system, can become unimportant for\nthe highly-lying states; the highly lying states reveal a multiplet structure\nof nearly degenerate states. Using the well established concepts of\nquark-hadron duality, asymptotic freedom in QCD and validity of the operator\nproduct expansion in QCD we show that the spectral densities obtained with the\nlocal currents that are connected to each other via chiral transformations,\nvery high in the spectrum must coincide. Hence effects of spontaneous breaking\nof chiral symmetry in QCD vacuum that are crucially important for the low-lying\nspectra, become irrelevant for the highly-lying states. Then to the extent that\nidentifiable hadronic resonances still exist in the continuum spectrum at high\nexcitations this implies that the highly excited hadrons must fall into\nmultiplets associated with the representations of the chiral group. We\ndemonstrate that this is indeed the case for meson spectra in the large $N_c$\nlimit.

The article begins with the general phenomenology of\nneutrino oscillations in vacuum and matter and documents the experimental\nevidence for oscillations of solar, reactor, atmospheric and accelerator\nneutrinos. Both active and sterile oscillation possibilities are considered.\nThe impact of cosmology (BBN, CMB, leptogenesis) and astrophysics (supernovae,\nhighest energy cosmic rays) on neutrino observables and vice versa, is\nevaluated. The predictions of grand unified, radiative and other models of\nneutrino mass are discussed. Ways of determining the unknown parameters of\nthree-neutrino oscillations are assessed, taking into account eight-fold\ndegeneracies in parameters that yield the same oscillation probabilities, as\nwell as ways to determine the absolute neutrino mass scale (from beta-decay,\nneutrinoless double-beta decay, large scale structure and Z-bursts). Critical\nunknowns at present are the amplitude of \\nu_\\mu to \\nu_e oscillations and the\nhierarchy of the neutrino mass spectrum; the detection of CP violation in the\nneutrino sector depends on these and on an unknown phase.

New experimental data on nucleon spin\nstructure at low to intermediate momentum transfers combined with existing high\nmomentum transfer data offer a comprehensive picture of the transition region\nfrom the {\\it confinement} regime of the theory to its {\\it asymptotic freedom}\nregime. Insight for some aspects of the theory is gained by exploring lower\nmoments of spin structure functions and their corresponding sum rules (i.e. the\nGerasimov-Drell-Hearn, Bjorken and Burkhardt-Cottingham). These moments are\nexpressed in terms of an operator product expansion using quark and gluon\ndegrees of freedom at moderately large momentum transfers. The sum rules are\nverified to a good accuracy assuming that no singular behavior of the structure\nfunctions is present at very high excitation energies. The higher twist\ncontributions have been examined through the moments evolution as the moments\nevolution as the momentum transfer varies from higher to lower values.\nFurthermore, QCD-inspired low-energy effective theories, which explicitly\ninclude chiral symmetry breaking, are tested at low momentum transfers. The\nvalidity of these theories is further examined as the momentum transfer\nincreases to moderate values. It is found that chiral perturbation calculations\nagree reasonably well with the first moment of the spin structure function\n$g_1$ at momentum transfer of 0.1 GeV$^2$ but fail to reproduce the neutron\ndata in the case of the generalized polarizability $\\delta_{LT}$. \n\n"}
