Two such systems have been proposed: (a) s-wave\nsuperconductor pair potential is proximity induced on a semiconductor, and (b)\npair potential naturally arises from an intrinsic s-wave pairing interaction.\nAs is now well known, such systems in the form of a 2D film or 1D nano-wires in\na wire-network can be used for topological quantum computation. When the\nexternal Zeeman splitting $\\Gamma$ crosses a critical value $\\Gamma_c$, the\nsystem passes from a regular superconducting phase to a non-Abelian topological\nsuperconducting phase. In both cases (a) and (b) we consider in this paper the\npair potential $\\Delta$ is strictly s-wave in both the ordinary and the\ntopological superconducting phases, which are separated by a topological\nquantum critical point at $\\Gamma_c = \\sqrt{\\Delta^2 + \\mu^2}$, where $\\mu (>>\n\\Delta)$ is the chemical potential.

This concerns, in particular, global gauge symmetry\nbreaking, related to Bose-Einstein condensation and superconductivity, or\nisotropy breaking, related to the generation of quantum vortices, and the\nstratification in multicomponent mixtures. A special type of symmetry\ntransformation, characteristic only for finite systems, is the change of shape\nsymmetry. These phenomena are illustrated by the examples of several typical\nmesoscopic systems, such as trapped atoms, quantum dots, atomic nuclei, and\nmetallic grains. The specific features of the review are: (i) the emphasis on\nthe peculiarities of the symmetry breaking in finite mesoscopic systems; (ii)\nthe analysis of common properties of physically different finite quantum\nsystems; (iii) the manifestations of symmetry breaking in the spectra of\ncollective excitations in finite quantum systems.

The spin-orbit torque corrections to the\nvelocity scale linearly with the skyrmion size, which is inversely proportional\nto the spin-orbit coupling. Consequently, the reactive spin-orbit torque\ncorrection can be the same order of magnitude as the non-relativistic\ncontribution. More importantly, the dissipative spin-orbit torque can be the\ndominant force that causes a deflected motion of the skyrmions if the torque\nexhibits a linear or quadratic relationship with the spin-orbit coupling. In\naddition, we demonstrate that the skyrmion velocity is determined by\nanisotropic magnetization damping parameters governed by the skyrmion size. \n\n"}

Our key finding is that MoS$_{2}$ nanoresonators exhibit\nsignificantly lower energy dissipation, and thus higher quality (Q)-factors by\nat least a factor of four below room temperature, than graphene.

However, the\ntopological charges associated with Na$_{3}$Bi and Cd$_{3}$As$_{2}$ are not\nclarified yet. In this work, we identify the topological charge of\nthree-dimensional Dirac points. It is found that although the simultaneous\npresence of the time-reversal and inversion symmetries forces the net chiral\ncharge to vanish, a Dirac point can carry another quantized topological charge\nwhen an additional rotation symmetry is considered. Two different classes of\nDirac semimetals are identified depending on the nature of the rotation\nsymmetries. First, the conventional symmorphic rotational symmetry which\ncommutes with the inversion gives rise to the class I Dirac semimetals having a\npair of Dirac points on the rotation axes. Since the topological charges of\neach pair of Dirac points have the opposite sign, a pair-creation or a\npair-annihilation is required to change the number of Dirac points in the\nmomentum space.

We perform\nmulti-million-atom atomistic tight-binding calculations to study the influence\nof electric fields on the electron and hole wave function confinements and\nsymmetries, the ground-state transition energies, the band-gap wavelengths, and\nthe optical transition modes. The electrical fields both parallel ($\\vec{E_p}$)\nand anti-parallel ($\\vec{E_a}$) to the growth direction are investigated to\nprovide a comprehensive guide on the understanding of the electric field\neffects.

In this article, we show that a local\nimpurity in a Chern insulator induces a twofold response: bound states that\ncarry a chiral current and a net current circulating around the impurity. This\nis a manifestation of broken time symmetry and persists even for an\ninfinitesimal impurity potential. To illustrate this, we consider a Coulomb\nimpurity in the Haldane model. Working in the low-energy long-wavelength limit,\nwe show that an infinitesimal impurity strength suffices to create bound\nstates. We find analytic wavefunctions for the bound states and show that they\ncarry a circulating current. In contrast, in the case of a trivial analogue,\ngraphene with a gap induced by a sublattice potential, bound states occur but\ncarry no current. In the many body problem of the Haldane model at\nhalf-filling, we use a linear response approach to demonstrate a circulating\ncurrent around the impurity. Impurity textures in insulators are generally\nexpected to decay exponentially; in contrast, this current decays polynomially\nwith distance from the impurity.

We also show that the\nphenomenology of the soft gap is intrinsically tied to the broadening and the\nheight of the Majorana zero mode(MZM)-induced differential conductance peak\nabove the topological quantum phase transition point with both the soft gap and\nthe quality of the MZM being simultaneously affected by tunnel barrier,\ntemperature, and dissipation.

Any quantum\nstate, for which the second-order correlation function falls below $1/2$, has a\nnonzero projection on the single-photon Fock state.

In non-topological\njunctions when the charging energy is small compared to the Josephson tunneling\nscale the low energy physics is described by 2pi phase slips. By contrast, in a\ntopological junction, due to the 4pi periodicity of the tunneling term it is\nusually expected that only 4pi phase slips are possible while 2pi phase slips\nare suppressed.

In addition, colloids\ngenerally present a size distribution which results in a virtually infinite\ncombination of colloid pairs.

An implementation in Nim is also provided.The methods, inspired\nby the seminal work of Torres et al., are based on a generalization of the cell\nand renormalized jellium models to polydisperse suspensions of spherical\ncolloids with a charge regulating boundary condition.

The suppression of the gap is\napproximately proportional to $e^{-1/\\lambda}$, where $\\lambda$ is the\ndimensionless superconducting coupling constant. This is consistent with the\nfact that a higher $\\lambda$ gives a more robust superconducting state. For an\n$s$-wave S, the interval of TI chemical potentials for which the suppression of\nthe gap is strong is centered at $\\mu_{TI} = \\pm\\sqrt{2mv_F^2\\mu}$, and\nincreases quadratically with the hopping parameter $t$.

The classification includes all possible magnetic\ntopological crystalline insulators protected by point group symmetry. Whereas\nthe classification of topological insulators is known to be given by the\n$K$-theory in the momentum space, computation of the $K$-theory has been a\ndifficult task in the presence of complicated crystallographic symmetry. Here\nwe consider the $K$-homology in the real space for this problem, instead of the\n$K$-theory in the momentum space, both of which give the same topological\nclassification. We apply the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence (AHSS) for\ncomputation of the $K$-homology, which is a mathematical tool for generalized\n(co)homology. In the real space picture, the AHSS naturally gives the\nclassification of higher-order topological insulators at the same time.

The system we tackle is thus made of one exciton plus\nzero or one FS electron-hole pair. At low doping, the system ground state is\npredominantly made of a \"trion-hole\"---a trion (two opposite-spin electrons\nplus a valence hole) weakly bound to a FS hole---with a small exciton\ncomponent. As the trion is poorly coupled to photon, the intensity of the\nlowest absorption peak is weak; it increases with doping, thanks to the growing\nexciton component, due to a larger coupling between 2-particle and 4-particle\nstates. Under a further doping increase, the trion-hole complex is less bound\nbecause of Pauli blocking by FS electrons, and its energy increases. The lower\npeak then becomes predominantly due to an exciton dressed by FS electron-hole\npairs, that is, an exciton-polaron. As a result, the absorption spectra of\n$n$-doped semiconductor quantum wells show two prominent peaks, the nature of\nthe lowest peak turning from trion-hole to exciton-polaron under a doping\nincrease.

This Paper develops and implements a theoretical framework for the\ninvestigation of the short-wave quantal properties of these\nsingle-quasiparticle excitations. The focus is primarily on the relationship\nbetween the quasiparticle energy eigenvalue spectrum and the geometrical shape\nof the normal-state region, i.e., the question of spectral geometry in the\nnovel setting of excitations confined by a superconducting pair-potential.\nAmong the central results of this investigation are two semiclassical trace\nformulas for the density of states.

This\neffect may pave a way for a quantum computing, with a large number of qubits\n$n\\simeq 100$--1000, far beyond the quantum chaos border. One of the\nmanifestations of such a thermalized non-equilibrated matter is revealed by a\nstrong asymmetry around 90$^\\circ $ c.m. of evaporating proton yield in the\nBi($\\gamma$,p) photonuclear reaction. The effect is described in terms of\nanomalously slow cross symmetry phase relaxation in highly excited quantum\nmany-body systems with exponentially large Hilbert space dimensions. In the\nabove reaction this phase relaxation is about eight orders of magnitude slower\nthan energy relaxation (thermalization). \n\n"}

By applying\nadiabatic and rotating wave approximations, we obtain an effective Hamiltonian\nthat governs the dynamics of the mechanical and LC resonators. Nonlinear terms\nin this Hamiltonian can be exploited for performing a quantum nondemolition\nmeasurement of Fock states of the nanomechanical resonator. We address the\nfeasibility of experimental implementation and show that the nonlinear coupling\ncan be made sufficiently strong to allow the detection of discrete mechanical\nFock states. \n\n"}

We investigate\nthe implementation of quantum gates for a paradigmatic, non-Markovian model: A\nsingle qubit coupled to a two-level system that is exposed to a heat bath. We\nsystematically search for optimal pulses using a generalization of the novel\nopen systems Gradient Ascent Pulse Engineering (GRAPE) algorithm. We show and\nexplain that next to the known optimal bias point of this model, there are\noptimal shapes which refocus unwanted terms in the Hamiltonian. We study the\nlimitations of controls set by the decoherence properties. This can lead to a\nsignificant improvement of quantum operations in hostile environments. \n\n"}
