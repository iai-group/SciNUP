Abstract: We consider the possibility that the dark matter, which is required to\nexplain the dynamics of the neutral hydrogen clouds at large distances from the\ngalactic center, could be in the form of a Bose-Einstein condensate. To study\nthe condensate we use the non-relativistic Gross-Pitaevskii equation. By\nintroducing the Madelung representation of the wave function, we formulate the\ndynamics of the system in terms of the continuity equation and of the\nhydrodynamic Euler equations. Hence dark matter can be described as a\nnon-relativistic, Newtonian Bose-Einstein gravitational condensate gas, whose\ndensity and pressure are related by a barotropic equation of state. In the case\nof a condensate with quartic non-linearity, the equation of state is polytropic\nwith index $n=1$. To test the validity of the model we fit the Newtonian\ntangential velocity equation of the model with a sample of rotation curves of\nlow surface brightness and dwarf galaxies, respectively. We find a very good\nagreement between the theoretical rotation curves and the observational data\nfor the low surface brightness galaxies. The deflection of photons passing\nthrough the dark matter halos is also analyzed, and the bending angle of light\nis computed. The bending angle obtained for the Bose-Einstein condensate is\nlarger than that predicted by standard general relativistic and dark matter\nmodels.

However there is\nno compelling direct evidence yet for (the dynamical effects of) dark energy.\nThe precision CMB data can be equally well fitted without dark energy if the\nspectrum of primordial density fluctuations is not quite scale-free and if the\nHubble constant is lower globally than its locally measured value.

Abstract: Path integral formulation of quantum mechanics (and also other equivalent\nformulations) depends on a Lagrangian and/or Hamiltonian function that is\nchosen to describe the underlying classical system.

It is supposed that in the outer region an extremal\nquasihorizon forms, whereas inside, the quasihorizon can be either nonextremal\nor extremal.

Both the nonextremal and extremal cases inside can be divided\ninto two situations, one in which there is no electromagnetic field, and the\nother in which there is an electromagnetic field. The situation with no\nelectromagnetic field requires a negative matter pressure (tension) on the\nboundary.

A canonical K\\\"{a}hler potential with\n\\textit{minimal coupling} to gravity can resolve the tachyonic instability but\nruns into the $\\eta$-problem. We suggest a model which is free of the\n$\\eta$-problem due to an additional coupling in the K\\\"{a}hler potential which\nis allowed by the Standard Model gauge group. This induces directions in the\npotential which we call K-flat.

By exploiting this structure the models\ndeveloped in CDTs differ from the analogous models developed in the Euclidean\ndomain, models of (Euclidean) Dynamical Triangulations (DT), and the\ncorresponding Lorentzian results are in many ways more \"physical\".\n  In this paper we use this insight to formulate a Lorentzian signature model\nthat is analogous to the Quantum Regge Calculus (QRC) approach to Euclidean\nQuantum Gravity. We exploit another crucial fact about the structure of\nLorentzian manifolds, namely that certain simplices are not constrained by the\ntriangle inequalities present in Euclidean signature.

Therefore, the\nDirac equation is generally equivalent to one fourth-order partial differential\nequation for one real function (A. Akhmeteli, J. Math. Phys. v.52, 082303\n(2011)). These results both belong in textbooks and can be used for development\nof new efficient methods of quantum chemistry. The matter field can be\nalgebraically eliminated both in scalar electrodynamics and in spinor\nelectrodynamics in a certain gauge. The resulting equations describe\nindependent dynamics of the electromagnetic field, which permits mathematical\nsimplification and can be useful for interpretation of quantum theory. For\nexample, in the Bohm interpretation, the electromagnetic field can replace the\nwave function as the guiding field.

It is\nimportant to realise that there are significant physical constraints on such\ninteger-based proposals when one (somewhat speculatively) attempts to extend\nthem outside their original extremal and supersymmetric framework.\nSpecifically, in their most natural and direct physical interpretations, some\nof the more speculative integer-based proposals for the quantization of horizon\nareas fail for the ordinary Kerr-Newman black holes in (3+1) dimensions,\nessentially because the fine structure constant is not an integer. A more\nbaroque interpretation involves asserting the fine structure constant is the\nsquare root of a rational number; but such a proposal has its own problems.\nInsofar as one takes (3+1) general relativity (plus the usual quantization of\nangular momentum and electric charge) as being paramount, the known explicitly\ncalculable spectra of horizon areas for the physically compelling Kerr-Newman\nspacetimes indicate that some caution is called for when assessing the\nuniversality of some of the more speculative integer-based string-inspired\nproposals. \n\n"}

To achieve $|<B>|\\leq 2$ uniquely,\none needs to impose a linearity requirement on the hidden variables model,\nwhich in turn adds a von Neumann-type stricture.

The situation however changed dramatically in the\npresence of magnetic field produced by the accretion disk surrounding the hole\nin the equatorial plane. In 1985, Wagh, Dhurandhar and Dadhich had for the\nfirst time considered the magnetic Penrose process (MPP) in which the magnetic\nfield could now provide the energy required for a fragment to ride on negative\nenergy orbit thereby overcoming the stringent velocity constraint of the\noriginal PP. Thus MPP turned very efficient and so much so that efficiency\ncould now even exceed 100 percent. They had in principle established revival of\nPP for astrophysical applications in powering the high energy sources. MPP is\nhowever similar to the earlier discovered and well known Blandford-Znajeck (BZ)\nmechanism in which the rotational energy of the hole is extracted out through a\npurely electromagnetic process. Though both the processes use magnetic field as\na device to extract rotational energy from the hole, yet their kernel is quite\ndifferent in spirit. For the former magnetic field provides the threshold\nenergy for particle to get onto negative energy orbit so that the other\nfragment goes out with enhanced energy while for the latter it generates an\nelectric potential difference between the equatorial plane and the polar\nregion, and it is the discharge of which that drives the energy flux out of the\nhole. In other words, MPP is still rooted in the spacetime geometry while BZ is\nessentially driven by electromagnetic interaction. \n\n"}

The criterion of vanishing quantum\ndiscord is related to the notion of reduction and, surprisingly, the\nhidden-variable model in $d=2$, which has been believed to be consistent so\nfar, is in fact inconsistent and excluded by the analysis of conditional\nmeasurement and reduction. The description of the full contents of quantum\ndiscord by the deterministic hidden-variables models is not possible. We also\nre-examine CHSH inequality. It is shown that the well-known prediction of CHSH\ninequality $|B|\\leq 2$ for the CHSH operator $B$ introduced by Cirel'son is not\nunique. This non-uniqueness arises from the failure of linearity condition in\nthe non-contextual hidden-variables model in $d=4$ used by Bell and CHSH, in\nagreement with Gleason's theorem which excludes $d=4$ non-contextual\nhidden-variables models.

Each first-class constraint\nin Maxwell's theory generates a change in the electric field E by an arbitrary\ngradient, spoiling Gauss's law. The secondary constraint p^i,_i=0 still holds,\nbut being a function of derivatives of momenta (mere auxiliary fields), it is\nnot directly about the observable electric field (a function of derivatives of\nA), which couples to charge. Only a special combination of the two first-class\nconstraints, the Anderson-Bergmann-Castellani gauge generator G, leaves E\nunchanged. Likewise only that combination leaves the canonical action\ninvariant---an argument independent of observables. If one uses a first-class\nconstraint to generate instead a canonical transformation, one partly strips\nthe canonical coordinates of physical meaning as electromagnetic potentials,\nvindicating the Anderson-Bergmann Lagrangian orientation of interesting\ncanonical transformations. The need to keep gauge-invariant q,t-dH/dp=-E-p=0\nsupports using the gauge generator and primary Hamiltonian rather than the\nseparate first-class constraints and the extended Hamiltonian.\n  Partly paralleling Pons's criticism, it is shown that Dirac's proof that a\nfirst-class primary constraint generates a gauge transformation, by comparing\nevolutions from _identical_ initial data, cancels out and hence fails to detect\nthe alterations made to the initial state. It also neglects the arbitrary\ncoordinates multiplying the secondary constraints _inside_ the canonical\nHamiltonian.

H is derived from the action of a massless Dirac\nfermion living in a domain of Rindler spacetime, in 1+1 dimensions, that has a\nboundary given by the world line of a uniformly accelerated observer.\n  The action contains a sum of delta function potentials that can be viewed as\npartially reflecting moving mirrors. An appropriate choice of the accelerations\nof the mirrors, provide primitive periodic orbits associated to the prime\nnumbers $p$, whose periods, measured by the observer's clock, are log p. Acting\non the chiral components of the fermion, H becomes the Berry-Keating\nHamiltonian (x p + p x)/2, where x is identified with the Rindler spatial\ncoordinate and p with the conjugate momentum.\n  The delta function potentials give the matching conditions of the fermion\nwave functions on both sides of the mirrors. There is also a phase shift for\nthe reflection of the fermions at the boundary where the observer sits. The\neigenvalue problem is solved by transfer matrix methods in the limit where the\nreflection amplitudes become infinitesimally small.

If\ndark matter populates the interior of stars, and this matter is supersymmetric\nor of some other type, some of it possessing a tiny electric charge, there is\nthe possibility that highly compact stars can trap a small but non-negligible\nelectric charge. In this case the radius to mass relation for such compact\nstars should get modifications. We use an analytical scheme to investigate the\nlimiting radius to mass relation and the maximum mass of relativistic stars\nmade of an incompressible fluid with a small electric charge. The investigation\nis carried out by using the hydrostatic equilibrium equation, i.e., the\nTolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation, together with the other equations of\nstructure, with the further hypothesis that the charge distribution is\nproportional to the energy density. The approach relies on Volkoff and Misner's\nmethod to solve the TOV equation. For zero charge one gets the interior\nSchwarzschild limit, and supposing incompressible boson or fermion matter with\nconstituents with masses of the order of the neutron mass one gets that the\nmaximum mass is the Misner mass. For a small electric charge, our analytical\napproximating scheme valid in first order in the star's electric charge, shows\nthat the maximum mass increases relatively to the uncharged case, whereas the\nminimum possible radius decreases, an expected effect since the new field is\nrepulsive aiding the pressure to sustain the star against gravitational\ncollapse. \n\n"}

We show that our model\nbroadly reproduces the observed scatter in HI at a given stellar mass as\nquantified by the HI mass function in bins of stellar mass, as well as the HI\nrichness versus local galaxy density. This shows that the predicted HI\nfluctuations and environmental effects are roughly consistent with data with\nfew minor discrepancies. For satellite galaxies in >= 10^12M_* halos, the HI\nrichness distribution is bimodal and drops towards the largest halo masses. The\ndepletion rate of HI once a galaxy enters a more massive halo is more rapid at\nhigher halo mass, in contrast to the specific star formation rate which shows\nmuch less variation in the attenuation rate versus halo mass. This suggests\nthat, up to halo mass scales probed here (<= 10^14M_*), star formation is\nmainly attenuated by starvation, but HI is additionally removed by stripping\nonce a hot gaseous halo is present. In low mass halos, the HI richness of\nsatellites is independent of radius, while in high mass halos they become\ngas-poor towards the center.

If, however, the asymmetry was found to be due\nto deeper causes, this conventional view of time evolution would need\nreworking. Here we show, using a sum-over-paths formalism, that a violation of\ntime reversal (T) symmetry might be such a cause. If T symmetry is obeyed, the\nformalism treats time and space symmetrically such that states of matter are\nlocalised both in space and in time. In this case, equations of motion and\nconservation laws are undefined or inapplicable.

Solutions are characterized by a complete Riemannian\n$n$-manifold $(M,g)$ and a positive function $N$, called the lapse. We study\nthis problem on Asymptotically Poincar\\'e-Einstein $n$-manifolds, $n\\ge 3$,\nwhen the conformal boundary-at-infinity is either a round sphere, a flat torus\nor smooth quotient thereof, or a compact hyperbolic manifold. Such manifolds\nhave well-defined Wang mass, and are time-symmetric slices of static, vacuum,\nasymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetimes. By integrating a mildly generalized\nform of an identity used by Lindblom, Shen, Wang, and others, we give a mass\nformula for such manifolds. In consequence, we observe that either the lapse is\ntrivial and $(M,g)$ is Poincar\\'e-Einstein or the Wang mass is negative, as in\nthe case of time symmetric slices of the AdS soliton. As an application, we use\nthe mass formula to compute the renormalized volume of the warped product\n$(X,\\gamma) = (M^3,g) \\times_{N^2} (S^1,dt^2)$.\n  We also give a mass formula for the case of a metric that is static in the\nregion exterior to a horizon on which the lapse function is zero. Then the\nmanifold $(X,\\gamma)$ is said to have a \"bolt\" where the $S^1$ factor shrinks\nto zero length. The renormalized volume of $(X,\\gamma)$ is expected on physical\ngrounds to have the form of the free energy per unit temperature for a black\nhole in equilibrium with a radiation bath at fixed temperature. When $M$ is\n3-dimensional and admits a horizon, we apply this mass formula to compute the\nrenormalized volume of $(X,\\gamma)$ and show that it indeed has the expected\nthermodynamically motivated form. \n\n"}

Which of these two possibilities occurs depends on a model\nand the initial conditions. In the quasiperiodic scenario there exist very\nspecial time-periodic solutions. They result for a delicate balance between\ndispersion and nonlinear interaction. The main body of this dissertation is\nconcerned with construction (by means of perturbative and numerical methods) of\ntime-periodic solutions for various nonlinear wave equations on bounded\ndomains. While turbulence is mainly associated with hydrodynamics, recent\nresearch in General Relativity has also revealed turbulent phenomena.

He successfully applied this idea to Newton's\ngravitostatics and to Maxwell's electrodynamics, where Kottler recast the field\nequations in premetric form and specified a metric-dependent constitutive law.\nWe will discuss the basics of the premetric approach and some of its beautiful\nconsequences, like the division of universal constants into two classes.

In particular, the absorption cross-section becomes dependent on\nboth, polar and azimuthal, spherical angles, projections of the angular\nmomentum do not keep anymore and the angular momentum operator by itself,\nthough remains quantised, is not quantised in integers.

Indeed,\neven defining appropriate notions of multipartite entanglement is a significant\nchallenge for general quantum systems. In this work, we initiate the study of\nmultipartite entanglement in a rich, yet tractable class of quantum states\ncalled stabilizer tensor networks. We demonstrate that, for generic stabilizer\ntensor networks, the geometry of the tensor network informs the multipartite\nentanglement structure of the state. In particular, we show that the average\nnumber of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) triples that can be extracted from\na stabilizer tensor network is small, implying that tripartite entanglement is\nscarce. This, in turn, restricts the higher-partite entanglement structure of\nthe states.

We\nstudy this quantity from a quantum information-theoretic perspective to clarify\nits role in diagnosing scrambling. When the CMI is zero, we find that the\nchannel has a special normal form consisting of local channels between\nindividual inputs and outputs. However, we find that arbitrarily low CMI does\nnot imply arbitrary proximity to a channel of this form, although it does imply\na type of approximate recoverability of one of the inputs.

It has been argued that this is an\nanalogue for quantum processes in the presence of closed timelike curves\n(CTCs). The unusual properties of states of quantum communication networks that\nfulfill the D-CTC condition have been discussed extensively in recent\nliterature. In this work, the D-CTC condition is investigated in the framework\nof quantum field theory in the local, operator-algebraic approach due to Haag\nand Kastler. It is shown that the D-CTC condition cannot be fulfilled in states\nwhich are analytic for the energy, or satisfy the Reeh-Schlieder property, for\na certain class of processes and initial conditions.

We focus on a minimal toy model of a\nrank 2 tensor gauge field, consisting of fractons coupled to an emergent\ngraviton (massless spin-2 excitation). We show how to reconcile the immobility\nof fractons with the expected gravitational behavior of the model. First, we\nreformulate the fracton phenomenon in terms of an emergent center of mass\nquantum number, and we show how an effective attraction arises from the\nprinciples of locality and conservation of center of mass. This interaction\nbetween fractons is always attractive and can be recast in geometric language,\nwith a geodesic-like formulation, thereby satisfying the expected properties of\na gravitational force. This force will generically be short-ranged, but we\ndiscuss how the power-law behavior of Newtonian gravity can arise under certain\nconditions. We then show that, while an isolated fracton is immobile, fractons\nare endowed with finite inertia by the presence of a large-scale distribution\nof other fractons, in a concrete manifestation of Mach's principle.

A simple case considering the thermal\nequilibrium between the Schwarzschild black hole and radiation gas in an\nisolated box has been well investigated previously in detail, i.e. taking the\nconservation of energy and principle of maximal entropy for the isolated system\ninto account. In this paper, following the above spirit, the effects of massive\ngraviton on the thermal equilibrium will be investigated. For the gravity with\nmassive graviton, we will use the de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley (dRGT) massive\ngravity which has been proven to be ghost free.

Abstract: The black hole information paradox is resolved in string theory by a radical\nchange in the picture of the hole: black hole microstates are horizon sized\nquantum gravity objects called `fuzzballs' instead of vacuum regions with a\ncentral singularity. The requirement of causality implies that the quantum\ngravity wavefunctional $\\Psi$ has an important component not present in the\nsemiclassical picture: virtual fuzzballs. The large mass $M$ of the fuzzballs\nwould suppress their virtual fluctuations, but this suppression is compensated\nby the large number -- $Exp[S_{bek}(M)]$ -- of possible fuzzballs. These\nfuzzballs are extended compression-resistant objects. The presence of these\nobjects in the vacuum wavefunctional alters the physics of collapse when a\nhorizon is about to form; this resolves the information paradox. We argue that\nthese virtual fuzzballs also resist the curving of spacetime, and so cancel out\nthe large cosmological constant created by the vacuum energy of local quantum\nfields. Assuming that the Birkoff theorem holds to leading order, we can map\nthe black hole information problem to a problem in cosmology.

To this end, differently from other recent analyses, we combine\n\\emph{orthogonal} age and distance measurements at intermediary and high\nredshifts. We use observations of the lookback time to galaxy clusters,\nindirect estimates of the age of the Universe from the most recent Large-Scale\nStructure (LSS) and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data, along with the\nrecent detection of the baryon acoustic oscillations at $z = 0.35$.

The seeds\nof discord are the fundamental principles on which these theories are grounded.\nGeneral relativity, on one hand, is based on the equivalence principle, whose\nstrong version establishes the local equivalence between gravitation and\ninertia. Quantum mechanics, on the other hand, is fundamentally based on the\nuncertainty principle, which is essentially nonlocal in the sense that a\nparticle does not follow one trajectory, but infinitely many trajectories, each\none with a different probability. This difference precludes the existence of a\nquantum version of the strong equivalence principle, and consequently of a\nquantum version of general relativity. Furthermore, there are compelling\nexperimental evidences that a quantum object in the presence of a gravitational\nfield violates the weak equivalence principle. Now it so happens that, in\naddition to general relativity, gravitation has an alternative, though\nequivalent description, given by teleparallel gravity, a gauge theory for the\ntranslation group. In this theory torsion, instead of curvature, is assumed to\nrepresent the gravitational field. These two descriptions lead to the same\nclassical results, but are conceptually different. In general relativity,\ncurvature geometrizes the interaction, while torsion in teleparallel gravity\nacts as a force, similar to the Lorentz force of electrodynamics.

The\ninflaton decay to the Standard Model leptons and Higgs, via off-shell\nright-handed (s)neutrinos, reheats the Universe.
