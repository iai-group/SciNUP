Within the\ncontext of standard cosmology, the Universe must therefore contain a third\n`dark' component of energy, beyond matter and radiation. However, the current\ndata are still deemed insufficient to distinguish between an evolving dark\nenergy component and the simplest model of a time-independent cosmological\nconstant. In this paper, we examine the role played by our cosmic horizon R0 in\nour interrogation of the data, and reach the rather firm conclusion that the\nexistence of a cosmological constant is untenable. The observations are telling\nus that R0=c t0, where t0 is the perceived current age of the Universe, yet a\ncosmological constant would drive R0 towards ct (where t is the cosmic time)\nonly once, and that would have to occur right now. In contrast, scaling\nsolutions simultaneously eliminate several conundrums in the standard model,\nincluding the `coincidence' and `flatness' problems, and account very well for\nthe fact that R0=c t0. We show here that for such dynamical dark energy models,\neither R0=ct for all time (thus eliminating the apparent coincidence\naltogether), or that what we believe to be the current age of the universe is\nactually the horizon time th=R0/c, which is always shorter than t0. Our best\nfit to the Type Ia supernova data indicates that t0 would then have to be ~16.9\nbillion years. Though surprising at first, an older universe such as this would\nactually eliminate several other long-standing problems in cosmology, including\nthe (too) early appearance of supermassive black holes (at a redshift > 6) and\nthe glaring deficit of dwarf halos in the local group. \n\n"}

I demonstrate that\nunder quite natural assumptions about the dynamics of heavy ion collisions this\nleads to a universal (i.e. independent of the initial parton energy, but\ndependent on flavor and centrality) upper bound on the energy of the partons\nescaping from the plasma.

In this study, we employ a hadron gas\nequation of state to investigate the differences in the dynamics and viscosity\neffects. The specific event-by-event setup with initial conditions and\nfreeze-out from a non-equilibrium transport model allows for a direct\ncomparison between ideal fluid dynamics and transport simulations. At higher\nSPS energies, where the pure transport calculation cannot account for the high\nelliptic flow values, the smaller mean free path in the hydrodynamic evolution\nleads to higher elliptic flow values.

The essential features of this scenario\nare that the gaugino masses are of the anomaly-mediated SUSY breaking (AMSB)\nform, while scalar and trilinear soft SUSY breaking terms are highly\nsuppressed. Renormalization group effects yield an allowable sparticle mass\nspectrum, while at the same time avoiding charged LSPs; the latter are common\nin models with negligible soft scalar masses, such as no-scale or gaugino\nmediation models.

This connection to saturation physics will provide a\nquantitative measure of the degree to which this fundamental QCD phenomenon is\noccurring, and has important consequences in other high-energy scattering\nstudies. Second, the measurement of quark energy loss is feasible, either as a\ndirect measurement at a lower-energy EIC, or as an indirect measurement using\nhadron attenuation at higher energies. Such a measurement will offer the first\nexperimental validation of the energy independence of this process, which is a\nconsequence of the QCD analog of the LPM effect in QED.

To model the real-time non-perturbative effects in the\npropagation of a high energy jet through the strongly coupled QCD matter, we\nadopt an effective dimensionally reduced description in terms of the $(1+1)$\nquasi-Abelian Schwinger theory. This theory is exactly soluble at any value of\nthe coupling and shares with QCD the properties of dynamical generation of\n\"mesons\" with a finite mass and the screening of \"quark\" charge that are\ncrucial for describing the transition of the jet into hadrons. We find that\nthis approach describes quite well the vacuum jet fragmentation in $e^+e^-$\nannihilation at $z\\geq0.2$ at jet energies in the range of the LHC heavy ion\nmeasurements ($z$ is the ratio of hadron and jet momenta).

This anisotropy is characterized via a Fourier expansion of the\ndistribution of charged particles in azimuthal angle (phi), with the\ncoefficients v_n denoting the magnitude of the anisotropy. Significant v_2-v_6\nvalues are obtained as a function of transverse momentum (0.5<pT<20 GeV),\npseudorapidity (|eta|<2.5) and centrality using an event plane method. The v_n\nvalues for n>=3 are found to vary weakly with both eta and centrality, and\ntheir pT dependencies are found to follow an approximate scaling relation,\nv_n^{1/n}(pT) \\propto v_2^{1/2}(pT). A Fourier analysis of the charged particle\npair distribution in relative azimuthal angle (Dphi=phi_a-phi_b) is performed\nto extract the coefficients v_{n,n}=<cos (n Dphi)>. For pairs of charged\nparticles with a large pseudorapidity gap (|Deta=eta_a-eta_b|>2) and one\nparticle with pT<3 GeV, the v_{2,2}-v_{6,6} values are found to factorize as\nv_{n,n}(pT^a,pT^b) ~ v_n(pT^a)v_n(pT^b) in central and mid-central events.

But as with \"elliptic flow\" $v_2$ measurements,\nnon-hydrodynamic mechanisms such as jet production may contribute to other\nhigher azimuth multipoles $v_m$ as biases. Careful distinctions should be\nmaintained between jet-related and nonjet (possibly hydrodynamic) contributions\nto $v_m$ (e.g., \"nonflow\" and \"flow\"). In this study we consider several\nquestions: (a) To what extent do jet-like structures in two-dimensional (2D)\nangular correlations contribute to azimuth multipoles inferred from various\n$v_m$ methods? (b) If a multipole element is added to a 2D fit model is a\nnonzero amplitude indicative of a corresponding flow component? and (c) Can 2D\ncorrelations establish the necessity of nonjet contributions to some or all\nhigher multipoles?

Quench is implemented by evolving this initial configuration with the\neffective potential at a temperature $T > T_c$. We study the formation of Z(3)\ndomain structure and its evolution during the transition as $l$ rolls down in\ndifferent directions from the top of the central hill in the effective\npotential of $l$. When explicit Z(3) symmetry breaking effects (arising from\ndynamical quark effects) are small, then we find well defined Z(3) domains\nwhich coarsen in time. Remarkably, the magnitude plot of $l$ shows vacuum\nbubble like configurations arising during the quench. This first order\ntransition like behavior occurs even though there is no metastable vacuum\nseparated by a barrier from the true vacuum for the parameter values used. When\nthe initial field configuration everywhere rolls down roughly along the same\ndirection (as will happen with large explicit symmetry breaking) then we do not\nfind such bubble-like configurations.

The\nproposed superpotential is uniquely determined by applying a continuous R and a\nZ_2 discrete symmetry, whereas the Kahler potential respects a no-scale-type\nSU(54,1)/SU(54)x U(1)_R x Z_2 symmetry too. The inflaton is identified with a\nHiggs-like modulus whose the vacuum expectation value controls the\ngravitational strength. Thanks to a strong enough coupling (with a parameter cT\ninvolved) between the inflaton and the Ricci scalar curvature, inflation can be\nattained even for subplanckian values of the inflaton with cT>76 and the\ncorresponding effective theory being valid up to the Planck scale. The\ninflationary observables turn out to be in agreement with the current data and\nthe inflaton mass is predicted to be 3x10^13 GeV. At the cost of a relatively\nsmall superpotential coupling constant, the model offers also a resolution to\nthe mu problem of the MSSM. Supplementing MSSM by three right-handed neutrinos\nwe show that spontaneously arising couplings between the inflaton and the\nparticle content of MSSM not only ensure a sufficiently low reheating\ntemperature but also support a scenario of non-thermal leptogenesis\nconsistently with the neutrino oscillation parameters for gravitino heavier\nthan about 10^4 GeV. \n\n"}

At a scale \\zeta=2GeV, the PDA is a broad, concave and\nasymmetric function, whose peak is shifted 12-16% away from its position in\nQCD's conformal limit. These features are a clear expression of\nSU(3)-flavour-symmetry breaking.

In atomic\nnuclei the momentum distribution of nucleons above the Fermi momentum ($k>k_F\n\\approx 250$ Mev/c) is also dominated by short rangecorrelated\ndifferent-fermion (neutron-proton) pairs.\n  Purpose: Compare high-momentum unlike-fermion momentum distributions in\natomic and nuclear systems.\n  Methods: We show that, for $k>k_F$ MeV/c, nuclear momentum distributions are\nproportional to that of the deuteron. We then examine the deuteron momentum\ndistributions derived from a wide variety of modern nucleon-nucleon potentials\nthat are consistent with $NN$-scattering data.\n  Results: The high momentum tail of the deuteron momentum distribution, and\nhence of the nuclear momentum distributions appears to decrease as $k^{-4}$.\nThis behavior is shown to arise from the effects of the tensor part of the\nnucleon-nucleon potential. In addition, when the dimensionless interaction\nstrength for the atomic system is chosen to be similar to that of atomic\nnuclei, the probability for finding a short range different-fermion pair in\nboth systems is the same.\n  Conclusions: Although nuclei do not satisfy all of the conditions for Tan's\ncontact, the observed similarity of the magnitude and $k^{-4}$ shape of nuclear\nand atomic momentum distributions is remarkable because these systems differ by\nabout $20$ orders of magnitude in density.

In this paper BBN predictions with a light WIMP\nthat only couples to neutrinos are calculated. Recent observed abundances of\n^2H and ^4He are used to limit m_chi, Delta N_nu, N_eff, and the present-day\nbaryon density. Allowing for a neutrino coupled light WIMP and nonzero Delta\nN_nu, combined BBN and CMB data give lower limits to m_chi, with a best fit\nm_chi > 35 MeV, equivalent to no light WIMP at all. All masses below 4--9 MeV\n(depending on spin) are excluded. Without any light WIMP, BBN alone prefers\nDelta N_nu = 0.50 +- 0.23, favoring neither Delta N_nu = 0, nor a fully\nthermalized sterile neutrino (Delta N_nu = 1). This result is consistent with\nthe CMB constraint, N_eff = 3.30 +- 0.27, limiting \"new physics\" between BBN\nand recombination. Combining BBN and CMB data gives Delta N_nu = 0.35 +- 0.16\nand N_eff = 3.40 +- 0.16; while BBN and the CMB combined require Delta N_nu > 0\nat ~98% confidence, they disfavor Delta N_nu > 1 at > 99% confidence. Allowing\na neutrino-coupled light WIMP extends the allowed range slightly downward for\nDelta N_nu and slightly upward for N_eff simultaneously, leaving best-fit\nvalues unchanged. \n\n"}

Abstract: We analyze if the nucleon structure of the $\\alpha$ decaying nucleus can be\nvisible in the experimental bremsstrahlung spectra of the emitted photons which\naccompany such a decay. We develop a new formalism of the bremsstrahlung model\ntaking into account distribution of nucleons in the $\\alpha$ decaying nuclear\nsystem. We conclude the following: (1) After inclusion of the nucleon structure\ninto the model the calculated bremsstrahlung spectrum is changed very slowly\nfor a majority of the $\\alpha$ decaying nuclei. However, we have observed that\nvisible changes really exist for the $^{106}{\\rm Te}$ nucleus\n($Q_{\\alpha}=4.29$ MeV, $T_{1/2}$=70 mks) even for the energy of the emitted\nphotons up to 1 MeV.

We study such uncertainties and their degeneracies in the following\ncontext: three nuclei of great interest for large-scale experiments (76-Ge,\n130-Te, 136-Xe), two representative particle physics mechanisms (light and\nheavy Majorana neutrino exchange), and a large set of nuclear matrix elements\n(NME), computed within the quasiparticle random phase approximation (QRPA).

We identify two\ncompeting effects: (i) each individual jet widens as it propagates; (ii) the\nopening angle distribution for jets emerging from the plasma within any\nspecified range of energies has been pushed toward smaller angles, comparing to\npp jets with the same energies. The second effect arises because small-angle\njets suffer less energy loss and because jets with a higher initial energy are\nless probable in the ensemble. We illustrate both effects in a simple\ntwo-parameter model, and find that their consequence in sum is that the opening\nangle distribution for jets in any range of energies contains fewer narrow and\nwide jets. Either effect can dominate in the mean opening angle, for not\nunreasonable values of the parameters. So, the mean opening angle for jets with\na given energy can easily shift toward smaller angles, as experimental data may\nindicate, even while every jet in the ensemble broadens. \n\n"}

It has been recently argued that\nthe post-merger ringdown waveform of exotic ultracompact objects is initially\nidentical to that of a black-hole, and that putative corrections at the horizon\nscale will appear as secondary pulses after the main burst of radiation. Here\nwe extend this analysis in three important directions: (i) we show that this\nresult applies to a large class of exotic compact objects with a photon sphere\nfor generic orbits in the test-particle limit; (ii) we investigate the\nlate-time ringdown in more detail, showing that it is universally characterized\nby a modulated and distorted train of \"echoes\" of the modes of vibration\nassociated with the photon sphere; (iii) we study for the first time\nequal-mass, head-on collisions of two ultracompact boson stars and compare\ntheir gravitational-wave signal to that produced by a pair of black-holes. If\nthe initial objects are compact enough as to mimic a binary black-hole\ncollision up to the merger, the final object exceeds the maximum mass for boson\nstars and collapses to a black-hole.

Such a model is able to describe the main feature\nof the non-perturbative dynamics: the enhancement of the interaction strength\nnear $T_c$. We show that the resulting charm in-medium evolution is able to\ncorrectly predict simultaneously the nuclear suppression factor, $R_{AA}$, and\nthe elliptic flow, $v_2$, at both RHIC and LHC energies and at different\ncentralities. The hadronization of charm quarks is described by mean of an\nhybrid model of fragmentation plus coalescence and plays a key role toward the\nagreeement with experimental data.\n  We also performed calculations within the Langevin approach which can lead to\nvery similar $R_{AA}(p_T)$ as Boltzmann, but the charm drag coefficient as to\nbe reduced by about a $30\\%$ and also generates an elliptic flow $v_2(p_T)$ is\nabout a $15\\%$ smaller.

We first generate partons just after the collisions by\nusing event generators. These partons dynamically generate the quark gluon\nplasma (QGP) fluids through the source terms in the hydrodynamic equations.\nAccording to the core-corona picture, this process tends to happen where the\ndensity of generated partons is high and their transverse momentum is low. Some\npartons do not fully participate in this process when they are in dilute\nregions or their transverse momentum is high and subsequently fragment into\nhadrons through string fragmentation. In this framework, the final hadrons come\nfrom either chemically equilibrated fluids as in the conventional hydrodynamic\nmodels or string fragmentation.

This suggests that a\nnon-trivial version of the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) may also apply to\ngauge symmetries that are discrete, despite there being no associated massless\nfield, therefore pushing the conjecture beyond the slogan that `gravity is the\nweakest force'.

The theme of the present work is a careful and realistic\nassessment of this question, taking into account the statistical significance\nof the various neutrino signals. Not surprisingly, neutrino-electron forward\nscattering leads to a good determination of the supernova direction, even in\nthe presence of the large and nearly isotropic background from other reactions.\nEven with the most pessimistic background assumptions, SuperKamiokande (SK) and\nthe Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) can restrict the supernova direction to\nbe within circles of radius $5^\\circ$ and $20^\\circ$, respectively. Other\nreactions with more events but weaker angular dependence are much less useful\nfor locating the supernova. Finally, there is the oft-discussed possibility of\ntriangulation, i.e., determination of the supernova direction based on an\narrival time delay between different detectors. Given the expected statistics\nwe show that, contrary to previous estimates, this technique does not allow a\ngood determination of the supernova direction. \n\n"}

Hence these breakings must be\nsuppressed high in the spectrum and the spectrum of high-lying hadrons must\nexhibit $U(2)_L \\times U(2)_R$ symmetry of the classical QCD Lagrangian. This\nargument can be made stronger for mesons in the large $N_c$ limit. In this\nlimit all mesons are stable against strong decays and the spectrum is infinite.\nHence, one can excite mesons of arbitrary large size with arbitrary large\naction, in which case the semiclassical limit is manifest. Actually we do not\nneed the exact $N_c=\\infty$ limit. For any large action there always exist such\n$N_c$ that the isolated mesons with such an action do exist and can be\ndescribed semiclassically. From the empirical fact that we observe multiplets\nof chiral and $U(1)_A$ groups high in the hadron spectrum it follows that\n$N_c=3$ is large enough for this purpose. \n\n"}

This is justified by the\nnonlinear and nonperturbative dynamics of QCD. None of physical\nobservables/processes in low-energy QCD will be directly affected by such a\ntemporary violation of color gauge invariance/symmetry. No\ntruncations/approximations and no special gauge choice are made for the\nregularized skeleton loop integrals, contributing to the full gluon\nself-energy, which enters the Schwinger-Dyson equation for the full gluon\npropagator. In order to make the existence of a mass gap perfectly clear the\ncorresponding subtraction procedure is introduced. All this allows one to\nestablish the general structure of the full gluon propagator and the\ncorresponding gluon Schwinger-Dyson equation in the presence of a mass gap. It\nis mainly generated by the nonlinear interaction of massless gluon modes.The\nphysical meaning of the mass gap is to be responsible for the large-scale\n(low-energy/momentum), i.e., nonperturbative structure of the true QCD vacuum.\nIn the presence of a mass gap two different types of solutions for the full\ngluon propagator are possible. The massive solution leads to an effective gluon\nmass, which explicitly depends on the gauge-fixing parameter. This solution\nbecomes smooth at small gluon momentum in the Landau gauge.

The phase diagram has a chiral symmetry\nbreaking vacuum, a color superconductor phase at high density, and a mixed\nphase in between which can describe nuclear matter if the high density regions\nin the mixed phase form droplets. This is amusingly similar to the phase\ndiagram of the copper oxide superconductors, although their critical\ntemperatures are smaller by a factor of about 10^{-9} and their mixed phase\nseems to form stripes, rather than droplets. This and other approaches to QCD\nwith two massless quarks suggests the existence of a tricritical point on the\nboundary of the phase with spontaneously broken chiral symmetry. In QCD with\nmassive quarks there is then a critical point at the end of a first order\ntransition line.

In particular, for N_f=1, our large-N_c\nlimit gives a theory that we recently proved to be equivalent, in the bosonic\nsector, to N=1 supersymmetric gluodynamics. Using known properties of the\nlatter, we derive several qualitative and semi-quantitative predictions for\nN_f=1 massless QCD which can be easily tested in lattice simulations. Finally,\nwe comment on possible applications for pure SU(3) Yang-Mills theory and real\nQCD. \n\n"}

We identify the channels of\ninflaton energy decay, cascading from tachyon annihilation through massive\nclosed string loops, KK modes, and brane displacement moduli to the lighter\nstandard model particles. Cosmological data constrains scenarios by putting\nstringent limits on the fraction of reheating energy deposited in gravitons and\nnonstandard sector massive relics. We estimate the energy deposited into\nvarious light degrees of freedom in the open and closed string sectors, the\ntiming of reheating, and the reheating temperature.

For the Au+Au excitation function a transition from the\nsqueeze-out to an in-plane enhanced emission is consistently described with\nmean field potentials corresponding to one incompressibility. For the Pb (158 A\nGeV) Pb system the elliptic flow prefers in-plane emission both for protons and\npions, the directed flow of protons is opposite to that of the pions, which\nexhibit anti-flow. Strong directed transverse flow is present for protons and\nLambdas in Au (6 A GeV) Au collisions as well. Both for the SPS and the AGS\nenergies the agreement between data and calculations is remarkable. \n\n"}

Abstract: The centrality dependence of (multi-)strange hadron abundances is studied for\nPb(158 AGeV)Pb reactions and compared to p(158 GeV)Pb collisions. The\nmicroscopic transport model UrQMD is used for this analysis. The predicted\nLambda/pi-, Xi-/pi- and Omega-/pi- ratios are enhanced due to rescattering in\ncentral Pb-Pb collisions as compared to peripheral Pb-Pb or p-Pb collisions. A\nreduction of the constituent quark masses to the current quark masses m_s \\sim\n230 MeV, m_q \\sim 10 MeV, as motivated by chiral symmetry restoration, enhances\nthe hyperon yields to the experimentally observed high values. Similar results\nare obtained by an ad hoc overall increase of the color electric field strength\n(effective string tension of kappa=3 GeV/fm). The enhancement depends strongly\non the kinematical cuts. The maximum enhancement is predicted around\nmidrapidity. For Lambda's, strangeness suppression is predicted at\nprojectile/target rapidity. For Omega's, the predicted enhancement can be as\nlarge as one order of magnitude. Comparisons of Pb-Pb data to proton induced\nasymmetric (p-A) collisions are hampered due to the predicted strong asymmetry\nin the various rapidity distributions of the different (strange) particle\nspecies. In p-Pb collisions, strangeness is locally (in rapidity) not\nconserved. The present comparison to the data of the WA97 and NA49\ncollaborations clearly supports the suggestion that conventional (free)\nhadronic scenarios are unable to describe the observed high (anti-)hyperon\nyields in central collisions. The doubling of the strangeness to nonstrange\nsuppression factor, gamma_s \\approx 0.65, might be interpreted as a signal of a\nphase of nearly massless particles. \n\n"}
