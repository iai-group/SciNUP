With this requirement met, we show that a modified\ngravity theory can be specified by parametrizing the time evolution of its\ndark-matter density contrast, which is completely controlled by the dark matter\nstress history.

In order\nto determine which search topology has the highest exclusion power, the program\nalso includes, for each topology, information from the experiments on the\nexpected exclusion bound, which would have been observed in case of a pure\nbackground distribution.

In spite of\nthe fact that we used the simplified kernel, we believe that the main result of\nthe paper: the small ($\\leq 40%$) suppression of the inclusive productiondue to\nenergy conservation, reflects a general feature. This result leads us to\nbelieve that the small value of the nuclear modification factor is of a\nnon-perturbative nature.

When the tops\ndecay, these correlations imprint themselves on the angular patterns of the\nfinal quarks and leptons. While many approaches to the measurement of top spin\ncorrelations are known, the most common ones require detailed kinematic\nreconstructions and are insensitive to some important spin interference\neffects. In particular, spin-1 resonances with mostly-vector or mostly-axial\ncouplings to top cannot be easily discriminated from one another without\nappealing to mass-suppressed effects or to more model-dependent interference\nwith continuum Standard Model production. Here, we propose to probe the\nstructure of a resonance's couplings to tops by measuring the azimuthal angles\nof the tops' decay products about the production axis. These angles exhibit\nmodulations which are typically O(0.1-1), and which by themselves allow for\ndiscrimination of spin-0 from higher spins, measurement of the CP-phase for\nspin-0, and measurement of the vector/axial composition for spins 1 and 2. For\nrelativistic tops, the azimuthal decay angles can be well-approximated without\ndetailed knowledge of the tops' velocities, and appear to be robust against\nimperfect energy measurements and neutrino reconstructions. We illustrate this\npoint in the highly challenging dileptonic decay mode, which also exhibits the\nlargest modulations.

However, they can be linked by imposing the\nstability of the electroweak (EW) vacuum. The crucial ingredient is provided by\nthe generation of neutrino masses via a seesaw mechanism triggered by Yukawa\ninteractions between the standard model (SM) Higgs and lepton doublets and\nadditional heavy right-handed neutrinos. These neutrinos participate to the\nrenormalization group (RG) running of the dimensionless SM couplings, affecting\ntheir high-energy behavior. The Higgs quartic coupling is dragged towards\nnegative values, thus altering the stability of the EW vacuum. In the usual\ntype-I seesaw model, this effect is too small to be a threat since, in order to\ncomply with low-energy neutrino data, one is forced to consider either too\nsmall Yukawa couplings or too heavy right-handed neutrinos. In this paper we\nexplore this general idea in the context of low-scale seesaw models. These\nmodels are characterized by sizable Yukawa couplings and right-handed neutrinos\nwith mass of the order of the EW scale, thus maximizing their impact on the RG\nflow. As a general result, we find that Yukawa couplings such that ${\\rm\nTr}(Y_{\\nu}^{\\dag}Y_{\\nu}) \\gtrsim 0.4$ are excluded.

From the vertex function we\nextract the effective quark-gluon coupling and show that it grows with\nincreasing magnetic field strength. The effect is due to a subtle competition\nbetween the color charge associated to gluons and the color charge associated\nto quarks, the former being larger than the latter. In contrast, at high\ntemperature the effective thermo-magnetic coupling results exclusively from the\ncontribution of the color charge associated to quarks. This produces a decrease\nof the coupling with increasing field strength. We interpret the results in\nterms of a geometrical effect whereby the magnetic field induces, on average, a\ncloser distance between the (electrically charged) quarks and antiquarks. At\nhigh temperature, since the effective coupling is proportional only to the\ncolor charge associated to quarks, such proximity with increasing field\nstrength makes the effective coupling decrease due to asymptotic freedom. In\nturn, this leads to a decreasing quark condensate. In contrast, at zero\ntemperature both the effective strong coupling and the quark condensate\nincrease with increasing magnetic field. This is due to the color charge\nassociated to gluons dominating over that associated to quarks, with both\nhaving the opposite sign. Thus, the gluons induce a kind of screening of the\nquark color charge, in spite of the quark-antiquark proximity. The implications\nof these results for the inverse magnetic catalysis phenomenon are discussed. \n\n"}

This projection is\nusually carried out in a saddle-point approximation. Here we derive formulas\nfor an exact particle-number projection of the finite-temperature mean-field\nsolution. We consider both deformed nuclei, in which the pairing condensate is\nweak and the Hartree-Fock (HF) approximation is the appropriate mean-field\ntheory, and nuclei with strong pairing condensates, in which the appropriate\ntheory is the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) approximation, a method that\nexplicitly violates particle-number conservation. For the HFB approximation, we\npresent a general projection formula for a condensate that is time-reversal\ninvariant and a simpler formula for the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) limit,\nwhich is realized in nuclei with spherical condensates. We apply the method to\nthree heavy nuclei: a typical deformed nucleus $^{162}$Dy, a typical spherical\nnucleus $^{148}$Sm, and a transitional nucleus $^{150}$Sm in which the pairing\ncondensate is deformed. We compare the results of this projection with results\nfrom the saddle-point approximation and exact shell model Monte Carlo\ncalculations. We find that the approximate canonical HF entropy in the\nparticle-number projection decreases monotonically to zero in the limit when\nthe temperature goes to zero. However, in a nucleus with a strong pairing\ncondensate, the approximate canonical HFB entropy in the particle-number\nprojection decreases monotonically to a negative value, reflecting the\nviolation of particle-number conservation. Computationally, the exact\nparticle-number projection is more efficient than calculating the derivatives\nrequired in the saddle-point approximation. \n\n"}

To\nbegin with the effect of magnetic field on the thermodynamics, we have first\ncalculated the pressure of a thermal QCD medium in strong magnetic field limit\n(SML), where the pressure at fixed temperature increases with the magnetic\nfield faster than the increase with the temperature at constant magnetic field.\nThis can be envisaged from the dominant scale of thermal medium in SML, which\nis the magnetic field, like the temperature in thermal medium in absence of\nstrong magnetic field.

Within the cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm, the number of low-mass\nsubhalos within lens galaxies is expected to be large, implying that their\ncontribution to the lensing convergence field is approximately Gaussian and\ncould thus be described by their power spectrum.

As an example, we\napply our framework to two distinct subhalo populations: a truncated\nNavarro-Frenk-White subhalo population motivated by standard CDM, and a\ntruncated cored subhalo population motivated by self-interacting dark matter\n(SIDM).

A normal metal ($N$) in contact with a superconductor ($S$)\ncan trap these excitations; therefore such a trap can potentially improve the\ndevices performances. The two materials influence each other, a phenomenon\nknown as proximity effect which has drawn attention since the '60s. Here we\nstudy whether this mutual influence places a limitation on the possible\nperformance improvement in superconducting qubits. We first revisit the\nproximity effect in uniform $NS$ bilayers; despite the long history of this\nproblem, we present novel findings for the density of states. We then extend\nour results to describe a non-uniform system in the vicinity of a trap edge.\nUsing these results together with a phenomenological model for the suppression\nof the quasiparticle density due to the trap, we find in a transmon qubit an\noptimum trap-junction distance at which the qubit relaxation rate is minimized.\nThis optimum distance, of the order of 4 to 20 coherence lengths, originates\nfrom the competition between proximity effect and quasiparticle density\nsuppression.

As\nthe signal from a single electron spin is minute, different spin states are\nconverted to different charge states. Charge detection so far mostly relied on\nexternal electrometers, which hinders scaling to two-dimensional spin qubit\narrays. As an alternative, gate-based dispersive read-out based on off-chip\nlumped element resonators were introduced, but here integration times of 0.2 to\n2 ms were required to achieve single-shot read-out. Here we connect an on-chip\nsuperconducting resonant circuit to two of the gates that confine electrons in\na double quantum dot.

The entanglement is investigated in terms of the\nvon Neumann entropy, S=-Tr rho_A log rho_A, for a sub-system A of size r of the\nchain. The impurity contribution to the uniform part of the entanglement\nentropy, S_{imp}, is defined and analyzed in detail in both the gapless, J_2 <=\nJ_2^c, as well as the dimerized phase, J_2>J_2^c, of the model. This quantum\nimpurity model is in the universality class of the single channel Kondo model\nand it is shown that in a quite universal way the presence of the impurity in\nthe gapless phase, J_2 <= J_2^c, gives rise to a large length scale, xi_K,\nassociated with the screening of the impurity, the size of the Kondo screening\ncloud. The universality of Kondo physics then implies scaling of the form\nS_{imp}(r/xi_K,r/R) for a system of size R. Numerical results are presented\nclearly demonstrating this scaling. At the critical point, J_2^c, an analytic\nFermi liquid picture is developed and analytic results are obtained both at T=0\nand T>0. In the dimerized phase an appealing picure of the entanglement is\ndeveloped in terms of a thin soliton (TS) ansatz and the notions of impurity\nvalence bonds (IVB) and single particle entanglement (SPE) are introduced. The\nTS-ansatz permits a variational calculation of the complete entanglement in the\ndimerized phase that appears to be exact in the thermodynamic limit at the\nMajumdar-Ghosh point, J_2=J_1/2, and surprisingly precise even close to the\ncritical point J_2^c.

The D7-branes\nwrap 4-cycles on a local Calabi-Yau geometry. This is an extension of previous\nwork on hep-th/0311241, where a similar analysis was applied to the case of\nD3-branes. Our present analysis is based on the D7- and D3-brane\nDirac-Born-Infeld and Chern-Simons actions, and makes full use of the\nR-symmetries of the system, which allow us to compute explicitly results for\nthe fields lying at the D3-D7 intersections. A number of interesting new\nproperties appear as compared to the simpler case of configurations with only\nD3-branes. As a general result one finds that fluxes stabilize some or all of\nthe D7-brane moduli. We argue that this is important for the problem of\nstabilizing Kahler moduli through non-perturbative effects in KKLT-like vacua.\nWe also show that (0,3) imaginary self-dual fluxes, which lead to\ncompactifications with zero vacuum energy, give rise to SUSY-breaking soft\nterms including gaugino and scalar masses, and trilinear terms.

{"id": "hep-th/0501082", "contents": "Title: Predictive Landscapes and New Physics at a TeV Abstract: We propose that the Standard Model is coupled to a sector with an enormous\nlandscape of vacua, where only the dimensionful parameters--the vacuum energy\nand Higgs masses--are finely \"scanned\" from one vacuum to another, while\ndimensionless couplings are effectively fixed. This allows us to preserve\nachievements of the usual unique-vacuum approach in relating dimensionless\ncouplings while also accounting for the success of the anthropic approach to\nthe cosmological constant problem. It can also explain the proximity of the\nweak scale to the geometric mean of the Planck and vacuum energy scales. We\nrealize this idea with field theory landscapes consisting of $N$ fields and\n$2^N$ vacua, where the fractional variation of couplings is smaller than\n$1/\\sqrt{N}$. These lead to a variety of low-energy theories including the\nStandard Model, the MSSM, and Split SUSY. This picture suggests sharp new rules\nfor model-building, providing the first framework in which to simultaneously\naddress the cosmological constant problem together with the big and little\nhierarchy problems. Requiring the existence of atoms can fix ratio of the QCD\nscale to the weak scale, thereby providing a possible solution to the hierarchy\nproblem as well as related puzzles such as the $\\mu$ and doublet-triplet\nsplitting problems. We also present new approaches to the hierarchy problem,\nwhere the fine-tuning of the Higgs mass to exponentially small scales is\nunderstood by even more basic environmental requirements such as vacuum\nstability and the existence of baryons. These theories predict new physics at\nthe TeV scale, including a dark matter candidate. The simplest theory has\nweak-scale \"Higgsinos\" as the only new particles charged under the Standard\nModel, with gauge coupling unification near $10^{14}$ GeV. \n\n"}

The relevant\nHamiltonian perturbation, describing the interaction of the meson with the foam\nmedium, consists of off-diagonal stochastic metric fluctuations, connecting\ndistinct mass eigenstates (or the appropriate generalisation thereof in the\ncase of K-mesons), and it is proportional to the relevant momentum transfer\n(along the direction of motion of the meson pair). There are two kinds of\nCPT-violating effects in this case, which can be experimentally disentangled:\none (termed ``omega-effect'') is associated with the failure of the\nindistinguishability between the neutral meson and its antiparticle, and\naffects certain symmetry properties of the initial state of the two-meson\nsystem; the second effect is generated by the time evolution of the system in\nthe medium of the space-time foam, and can result in time-dependent\ncontributions of the $omega-effect type in the time profile of the two meson\nstate. Estimates of both effects are given, which show that, at least in\ncertain models, such effects are not far from the sensitivity of experimental\nfacilities available currently or in the near future.
