In this paper we use\nthis result as point of departure to prove the existence of the mass gap for\nquantum source-free Yang-Mills (Y-M) fields. The proof is facilitated by\nresults of our recently published paper, JGP 59 (2009) 600-619. Since both pure\ngravity, the Einstein-Maxwell and pure Y-M fields are described for axially\nsymmetric configurations by the Ernst equation classically, their quantum\ndescriptions are likely to be interrelated. Correctness of this conjecture is\nsuccessfully checked by reproducing (by different methods) results of Korotkin\nand Nicolai, Nucl.Phys.B475 (1996) 397-439, on dimensionally reduced quantum\ngravity. Consequently, numerous new results supporting the Faddeev-Skyrme (F-S)\n-type models are obtained. We found that the F-S-like model is best suited for\ndescription of electroweak interactions while strong interactions require\nextension of Witten's results to the SU(3) gauge group. Such an extension is\nnontrivial. It is linked with the symmetry group SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1) of the\nStandard Model.

The trivalent scheme has been\nquite successful at establishing a correspondence between braids and Standard\nModel particles, whereas the tetravalent scheme has naturally substantiated a\nrich, dynamical theory of interactions and propagation of braids, which is\nruled by topological conservation laws. Some recent advances in the program\nindicate that the two schemes may converge to yield a fundamental theory of\nmatter in quantum spacetime. \n\n"}

Its precise conceptual-mathematical formulation as \"modular localization\"\nwithin the setting of local operator algebras also suggests novel ways of\nlooking at general (non-integrable) QFTs which are not based on quantizing\nclassical field theories. Conformal QFT, which is known to admit no particle\ninterpretation, suggest the presence of a \"partial\" integrability, referred to\nas \"conformal integrability\". This manifest itself in a \"braid-permutation\"\ngroup structure which contains in particular informations about the anomalous\ndimensional spectrum. For chiral conformal models this reduces to the braid\ngroup as it is represented in Hecke- or Birman-Wenzl- algebras associated to\nchiral models.

These series\narise as coefficients in the R4 and D4R4 interactions in the low energy\nexpansion of scattering amplitudes in maximally supersymmetric string theory\nreduced to D=10-d dimensions on a torus T^d, d<8. For each d these amplitudes\nare automorphic functions on the rank d+1 symmetry group E_d+1. Of particular\nsignificance is the orbit content of the Fourier modes of these series when\nexpanded in three different parabolic subgroups, corresponding to certain\nlimits of string theory. This is of interest in the classification of a variety\nof instantons that correspond to minimal or next-to-minimal BPS orbits. In the\nlimit of decompactification from D to D+1 dimensions many such instantons are\nrelated to charged 1/2-BPS or 1/4-BPS black holes with euclidean world-lines\nwrapped around the large dimension. In a different limit the instantons give\nnonperturbative corrections to string perturbation theory, while in a third\nlimit they describe nonperturbative contributions in eleven-dimensional\nsupergravity. A proof is given that these three distinct Fourier expansions\nhave certain vanishing coefficients that are expected from string theory.

The corresponding mathematics\ninvolves showing that the wavefront sets of the Eisenstein series are supported\non only certain coadjoint nilpotent orbits - just the minimal and trivial\norbits in the 1/2-BPS case, and just the next-to-minimal, minimal and trivial\norbits in the 1/4-BPS case.

A direct and\nsimple argument supporting this claim is that this is the \"natural\" way how\nsuch distributions are formed. The transport of charged particle beams may\nserve as an example: An uncorrelated gaussian distribution of particles\nstarting at some initial position of the accelerator is subject to linear\ndeformations when passing through various beamline elements.

These models are defined by Hamiltonians which include the\nreflection operators in the two variables x and y. The singular or caged Dunkl\noscillator is second-order superintegrable and admits separation of variables\nin both Cartesian and polar coordinates. The spectrum of the Hamiltonian is\nobtained algebraically and the separated wavefunctions are given in the terms\nof Jacobi, Laguerre and generalized Hermite polynomials. The symmetry\ngenerators are constructed from the su(1,1) dynamical operators of the\none-dimensional model and generate a cubic symmetry algebra. In terms of the\nsymmetries responsible for the separation of variables, the symmetry algebra of\nthe singular Dunkl oscillator is quadratic and can be identified with a special\ncase of the Askey-Wilson algebra AW(3) with central involutions. The 2:1\nanisotropic Dunkl oscillator model is also second-order superintegrable. The\nenergies of the system are obtained algebraically, the symmetry generators are\nconstructed using the dynamical operators and the resulting symmetry algebra is\nquadratic.

Their investigation over the finite fields has not been\ndone thoroughly, partly because of the indeterminacies that appear in defining\nthe equations. In this paper we introduce two methods to well-define the\nequations over the finite fields and apply the methods to several classes of\ndiscrete integrable equations. One method is to extend the space of initial\nconditions through blowing-up at the singular points. In case of discrete\nPainlev\\'{e} equations, we prove that an finite field analog of the Sakai\ntheory can be applied to construct the space of initial conditions.

Since the csfopde is the basic one and\nsince the Klein-Gordon equations for {\\lambda} and {\\rho} possess solutions\nthat are not solutions of the csfopde for {\\lambda} and {\\rho} we infer that it\nis legitimate to attribute to those fields mass dimension 3/2 (as is the case\nof Dirac spinor fields) and not mass dimension 1 as previously suggested in\nrecent literature (see list of references). A proof of this fact is offered by\nderiving the csfopde for the {\\lambda} and {\\rho} from a Lagrangian where these\nfields have indeed mass dimension 3/2. Taking seriously the view that Elko\nspinor fields due to its special properties given by their bilinear invariants\nmay be the description of some kind of particles in the real world a question\nthen arises: what is the physical meaning of these fields?

The first\nmethod used is that attributed to Belinfante: starting from the spinor form of\nthe action, the well-known canonical stress-energy tensor is augmented, by\nextending the Noether symmetry current to include contributions from the\nLorentz group, to a manifestly symmetric form. This form admits a transcription\nto bilinear current form. The second method used is the variational derivation\nbased on the covariant coupling to general relativity. The starting point here\nat the outset is the transcription of the action using, as independent field\nvariables, both the bilinear currents, together with a gauge invariant vector\nfield (a proxy for the electromagnetic vector potential). A central feature of\nthe two constructions is that they both involve the mapping of the Dirac\ncontribution to the stress-energy from the spinor fields to the equivalent set\nof bilinear tensor currents, through the use of appropriate Fierz identities.\nAlthough this mapping is done at quite different stages, nonetheless we find\nthat the two forms of the bilinear stress-energy tensor agree.

To\nconstruct global solutions we use a combination of energy estimates and\nmatching dispersive estimates.

This problem connects to the classical\ntheory of special functions and, more specifically, to the Hermite as well as\nthe Kummer hypergeometric functions. Reconstructing the solution of the\noriginal diffusion model from novel self-similar solutions of the associated\nself-similar PDE, we infer that the $t^{-1/2}$ decay law of the diffusion\namplitude is {\\it not necessary}. In particular, it is possible to engineer\nsetups of {\\it both} the Cauchy problem and the initial-boundary value problem\nin which the solution decays at a {\\it different rate}. Nevertheless, we\nobserve that the $t^{-1/2}$ rate corresponds to the dominant decay mode among\nintegrable initial data, i.e., ones corresponding to finite mass. Hence, unless\nthe projection to such a mode is eliminated, generically this decay will be the\nslowest one observed.

However, as the complexity of the sum grows\nrapidly with the length N of the spin chain, the exact wave function in the\ncontinuum limit is too cumbersome to be exploited. In this note we provide an\napproximation to the CBA whose complexity does not directly depend upon N. This\nconsists of two steps.

Applications to cosmic-dust\n  alignment and to wobbling comets and asteroids Abstract: Neutron stars, asteroids, comets, cosmic-dust granules, spacecraft, as well\nas whatever other freely spinning body dissipate energy when they rotate about\nany axis different from principal. We discuss the internal-dissipation-caused\nrelaxation of a freely precessing rotator towards its minimal-energy mode (mode\nthat corresponds to the spin about the maximal-inertia axis). While the body\nnutates at some rate, the internal stresses and strains within the body\noscillate at frequencies both higher and lower than this rate. The internal\ndissipation takes place mostly the second and higher harmonics. We discuss the\napplication of our findings to asteroids. Regarding the comets, estimates show\nthat the currently available angular resolution of spacecraft-based instruments\nmakes it possible to observe wobble damping within year- or maybe even\nmonth-long spans of time. We also discuss cosmic-dust astrophysics; in\nparticular, the role played by precession damping in the dust alignment. We\nshow that this damping provides coupling of the grain's rotational and\nvibrational degrees of freedom; this entails occasional flipping of dust grains\ndue to thermal fluctuations. During such a flip, grain preserves its angular\nmomentum, but the direction of torques arising from H2 formation reverses. As a\nresult, flipping grain will not rotate fast in spite of the action of\nuncompensated H2 formation torques. The grains get ``thermally trapped,'' and\ntheir alignment is marginal. \n\n"}

We show the following: A) Varadarajan's states {\\it are}\ncomplexifier coherent states. This unifies all states constructed so far under\nthe general complexifier principle. B) Ashtekar and Lewandowski suggested a\nnon-Abelean generalization of Varadarajan's states to QGR which, however, are\nno longer of the complexifier type. We construct a new class of non-Abelean\ncomplexifiers which come close to the one underlying Varadarajan's\nconstruction. C) Non-Abelean complexifiers close to Varadarajan's induce new\ntypes of Hilbert spaces which do not support the operator algebra of QGR. The\nanalysis suggests that if one sticks to the present kinematical framework of\nQGR and if kinematical coherent states are at all useful, then normalizable,\ngraph dependent states must be used which are produced by the complexifier\nmethod as well.

Therefore, three pairs of planes also known as\nblades, can be defined, and make up the underlying geometrical structure, at\neach point. These tetrad vectors are gauge dependent on one hand, and also in\ntheir definition, there is an additional inherent freedom in the choice of two\nvector fields. In order to get rid of the gauge dependence, another set of\ntetrads is defined, such that the only choice we have to make is for the two\nvector fields. A particular choice is made for these two vector fields such\nthat they are gauge dependent, but the transformation properties of these\ntetrads are analogous to those already known for curved spacetimes where only\nelectromagnetic fields are present.

Wave Turbulence (WT) is a\ntheory derived for describing statistics of weakly nonlinear waves in the\ninfinite basin limit. Its formal applicability condition on the minimal size of\nthe computational basin is impossible to satisfy in present numerical\nsimulations, and the number of wave resonances is significantly depleted due to\nthe wavenumber discreteness. The goal of this paper will be to examine which WT\npredictions survive in such discrete systems with depleted resonances and which\nproperties arise specifically due to the discreteness effects. As in\n\\cite{DKZ,onorato,naoto}, our results for the wave spectrum agree with the\nZakharov-Filonenko spectrum predicted within WT.
