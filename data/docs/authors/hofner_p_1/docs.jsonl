We show that constrained transport can be implemented with\nvolume-centered fields and hyperresistivity on a high-order finite difference\nstencil.

This result\nnot only supports the earlier finding that the azimuthal and polar widths of\nthese subbeams narrow with distance (as R^(-3) and R^(-1), respectively), but\nalso implies that the boundary contribution to the solution of the wave\nequation governing the radiation field does not always vanish in the limit\nwhere the boundary tends to infinity. There is a fundamental difference between\nthe classical expressions for the retarded potential and field: while the\nboundary contribution for the potential can always be made zero via a gauge\ntransformation preserving the Lorenz condition, that for the field may be\nneglected only if it diminishes with distance faster than the contribution of\nthe source density in the far zone. In the case of a rotating superluminal\nsource, however, the boundary term in the retarded solution for the field is by\na factor of order R^(1/2) larger than the source term of this solution in the\nlimit, which explains why an argument based on the solution of the wave\nequation governing the field that neglects the boundary term (such as that\npresented by J.

Given\nthat the distribution of the radiation field of an accelerated superluminal\nsource in the far zone is not known a priori, the only way to calculate the\nfree-space radiation field of such sources is via the retarded solution for the\npotential.

The gas forms long spiral arms typical of\ngrand design galaxies, although the spiral pattern is asymmetric. The primary\ndifference from a grand-design spiral galaxy, which has a consistent 2/4-armed\npattern, is that instead of passing through the spiral arms, gas generally\nfalls into a developing potential minimum and is released only when the local\nminimum dissolves.

The mass spectrum of the self-gravitating\ncores reproduces very well the observed initial mass function and identifies\nthe different mechanisms responsible for its behaviour.

The cut-off exists\nalready in the case of pure thermal collapse, provided that the underlying\ndensity field has a lognormal distribution.

The planet's orbit is characterized by a small but nonzero\neccentricity of $e$=0.05 and the semi-major axis of 0.61 AU, which makes it the\nmost compact one discovered so far around GK-giants. This detection adds to the\nexisting evidence that, as predicted by theory, the minimum size of planetary\norbits around intermediate-mass giants is affected by both planet formation\nprocesses and stellar evolution. The currently available evidence for another\nplanet around HD 102272 is insufficient to obtain an unambiguous two-orbit\nsolution. \n\n"}

As the shocked secondary wind is responsible for most of the\nX-ray emission, the accretion process accounts for the X-ray minimum.

The mean reddening affecting the NGC 247 Cepheids of\nE(B-V) = 0.18 $\\pm$ 0.02 mag is mostly produced in the host galaxy itself and\nis significantly higher than what was found in the previous optical Cepheid\nstudies in NGC 247 of our own group, and Madore et al., leading to a 7%\ndecrease in the previous optical Cepheid distance. As in other studies of our\nproject, the distance modulus of NGC 247 we report is tied to an assumed LMC\ndistance modulus of 18.50. Comparison with other distance measurements to NGC\n247 shows that the present IR-based Cepheid distance is the most accurate among\nthese determinations.\n  With a distance of 3.4 Mpc, NGC 247 is about 1.5 Mpc more distant than NGC 55\nand NGC 300, two other Sculptor Group spirals analyzed before with the same\ntechnique by our group. \n\n"}

We present observations of the linearly polarized radio\ncontinuum emission in this WSRT-SINGS galaxy sample. Of the 28 galaxies treated\nin this paper, 21 are detected in polarized radio continuum at 18- and 22-cm\nwavelengths. We utilize the rotation measure synthesis (RM-Synthesis) method,\nas implemented by Brentjens & de Bruyn, to coherently detect polarized emission\nfrom a large fractional bandwidth, while simultaneously assessing the degree of\nFaraday rotation experienced by the radiation along each line-of-sight. This\nrepresents the first time that the polarized emission and its Faraday rotation\nhave been systematically probed down to ~10 microJy/beam RMS for a large sample\nof galaxies. Non-zero Faraday rotation is found to be ubiquitous in all of the\ntarget fields, from both the Galactic foreground and the target galaxies\nthemselves. In this paper, we present an overview of the polarized emission\ndetected in each of the WSRT-SINGS galaxies.

From the simulation results, we confirm the expectations based on\nanalytic arguments that the Vainshtein mechanism does operate as anticipated,\nwith the density power spectrum approaching that of standard gravity within a\nmodified background evolution in the nonlinear regime. The transition is very\nbroad and there is no well defined Vainshtein scale, but roughly this\ncorresponds to k_*~ 2 at redshift z=1 and k_*~ 1 at z=0. We checked that while\nextrinsic curvature fluctuations go nonlinear, and the dynamics of the\nbrane-bending mode C receives important nonlinear corrections, this mode does\nget suppressed compared to density perturbations, effectively decoupling from\nthe standard gravity sector. At the same time, there is no violation of the\nweak field limit for metric perturbations associated with C.

Here we present the first results from this survey based on\nobservations of SDSS J104257.58+074850.5 ($z_{QSO}$ = 2.66521), a quasar at an\nangular separation from a foreground galaxy ($z_{gal}$ = 0.03321) of 2.5\" (1.7\nkpc in projection). The foreground galaxy is a low-luminosity spiral with\non-going star formation (0.004 M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$) and a\nmetallicity of $-0.27 \\pm 0.05$ dex. We detect 21cm absorption from the galaxy\nwith the Green Bank Telescope (GBT), the Very Large Array (VLA), and the Very\nLong Baseline Array (VLBA). The absorption appears to be quiescent disk gas\ncorotating with the galaxy and we do not find any evidence for outflowing cold\nneutral gas. The width of the main absorption line indicates that the gas is\ncold, $T_{k} < 283$ K, and the HI column is surprisingly low given the impact\nparameter of 1.7 kpc; we find that N(HI) $\\leq 9.6 \\times 10^{19}$ cm$^{-2}$\n(GBT) and N(HI) $\\leq 1.5 \\times 10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$ (VLBA). VLBA marginally\nresolves the continuum source and the absorber, and a lower limit of 27.1\n$\\times$ 13.9 pc is derived for the size of the absorbing cloud. In turn, this\nindicates a low density for a cold cloud, n(HI) $<$ 3.5 cm$^{-3}$. We\nhypothesize that this galaxy, which is relatively isolated, is becoming\ndepleted in HI because it is converting its interstellar matter into stars\nwithout a replenishing source of gas, and we suggest future observations to\nprobe this and similar galaxies. \n\n"}

Our photometry reaches below\nthe oldest main sequence turn-offs, which allows us to estimate the age and\nduration of the main episode of star formation in Cetus.

In the absence of a compelling theory to test, a\nnatural approach is to better characterize the properties of dark energy in\nsearch of clues that can lead to a more fundamental understanding. One way to\nview this characterization is the improved determination of the\nredshift-dependence of the dark energy equation of state parameter, w(z). To do\nthis requires a robust and bias-free method for reconstructing w(z) from data\nthat does not rely on restrictive expansion schemes or assumed functional forms\nfor w(z). We present a new nonparametric reconstruction method that solves for\nw(z) as a statistical inverse problem, based on a Gaussian Process\nrepresentation.

In doing so, we\nintroduce a new concept of \"zero plane\" which is an imaginal source plane where\nshapes of all sources are perfect circles, and regard the intrinsic shear as\nthe result of an imaginal lensing distortion. This makes the relation between\nthe observed shear, the intrinsic shear and lensing distortion more simple and\nthus higher-order calculation more easy. The elliptical weight function allows\nus to measure the mutiplemoment of shape of background galaxies more precisely\nby weighting highly to brighter parts of image and moreover to reduce\nsystematic error due to insufficient expansion of the weight function in the\noriginal approach of KSB. Point Spread Function(PSF) correction in E-HOLICs\nmethods becomes more complicated than those in KSB methods. In this paper we\nstudied isotropic PSF correction in detail.

At any given time, the observed soft binary distribution is\npredominantly a snapshot of a transient population. However, there is a\nconstantly growing population of long-lived soft binaries that are removed from\nthe detailed balance cycle due to the changing density and velocity dispersion\nof an expanding cluster. The total number of wide binaries that form, and their\nenergy distribution, are insensitive to the cluster population; the number is\napproximately one per cluster. This suggests that a population composed of many\ndissolved small-N clusters will more efficiently populate the field with wide\nbinaries than that composed of dissolved large-N clusters. Locally such\nbinaries are present at approximately the 2% level; thus the production rate is\nconsistent with the field being populated by clusters with a median of a few\nhundred stars rather than a few thousand. \n\n"}

For each transit we observed in two bands\nnearly-simultaneously by rapidly switching the WIRCam filter wheel back and\nforth for the duration of the observations. By combining all our J-band (~1.25\nmicrons) observations we find a transit depth in this band of 1.338\\pm0.013% -\na value consistent with the optical transit depth reported by Charbonneau and\ncollaborators. However, our best-fit combined Ks-band (~2.15 microns) transit\ndepth is deeper: 1.438\\pm0.019%. Formally our Ks-band transits are deeper than\nthe J-band transits observed simultaneously by a factor of 1.072\\pm0.018 - a\n4-sigma discrepancy. The most straightforward explanation for our deeper\nKs-band depth is a spectral absorption feature from the limb of the atmosphere\nof the planet; for the spectral absorption feature to be this prominent the\natmosphere of GJ 1214b must have a large scale height and a low mean molecular\nweight.

Abstract: The standard model of cosmology is based on the existence of homogeneous\nsurfaces as the background arena for structure formation. Homogeneity underpins\nboth general relativistic and modified gravity models and is central to the way\nin which we interpret observations of the CMB and the galaxy distribution.\nHowever, homogeneity cannot be directly observed in the galaxy distribution or\nCMB, even with perfect observations, since we observe on the past lightcone and\nnot on spatial surfaces. We can directly observe and test for isotropy, but to\nlink this to homogeneity, we need to assume the Copernican Principle. First, we\ndiscuss the link between isotropic observations on the past lightcone and\nisotropic spacetime geometry: what observations do we need to be isotropic in\norder to deduce spacetime isotropy? Second, we discuss what we can say with the\nCopernican assumption. The most powerful result is based on the CMB: the\nvanishing of the dipole, quadrupole and octupole of the CMB is sufficient to\nimpose homogeneity.

These morphological disturbances\nare related to the ram-pressure stripping and tidal interaction that galaxies\nundergo in this dense cluster environment. To quantify the morphological\ntransformation of the HI disks, we compute the morphological parameters of CAS,\nGini, and M20 and our own GM for 51 galaxies in 48 HI column density maps from\nthe VIVA project. Some morphological phenomena can be identified in this space\nof relatively low resolution HI data. Truncation of the HI disk can be cleanly\nidentified via the Concentration parameter (C<1) and Concentration can also be\nused to identify HI deficient disks (1<C<5). Tidal interaction is typically\nidentified using combinations of these morphological parameters, applied to\n(optical) images of galaxies. We find that some selection criteria (Gini-M20,\nAsymmetry, and a modified Concentration-M20) are still applicable for the\ncoarse (~15\" FWHM) VIVA HI data. The phenomena of tidal tails can be reasonably\nwell identified using the Gini-M20 criterion (60% of galaxies with tails\nidentified but with as many contaminants).

Reconnections in the dissipating\ncurrent layer effectively add twisted flux to the flux rope and thus allow it\nto rise quasi-statically, even though the magnetic energy is decreasing as the\nsystem relaxes. We examine the thermal features produced by the current layer\nformation and the associated \"tether-cutting\" reconnections as a result of\nheating and field aligned thermal conduction.

They dominate the interface between the chromosphere and\ncorona and may provide significant mass and energy to the corona. We use\nhigh-quality observations with the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope to establish\nthat so-called type II spicules are characterized by the simultaneous action of\nthree different types of motion: 1. field-aligned flows of order 50-100 km/s,\n2. swaying motions of order 15-20 km/s, and 3. torsional motions of order 25-30\nkm/s. The first two modes have been studied in detail before, but not the\ntorsional motions. Our analysis of many near-limb and off-limb spectra and\nnarrow-band images yields strong evidence that most, if not all, type-II\nspicules undergo large torsional modulation and that these motions, like\nspicule swaying, represent Alfvenic waves propagating outward at several\nhundred km/s. The combined action of the different motions explains the similar\nmorphology of spicule bushes in the outer red and blue wings of chromospheric\nlines, and needs to be taken into account when interpreting Doppler motions to\nderive estimates for field-aligned flows in spicules and determining the\nAlfvenic wave energy in the solar atmosphere.

Uniting all this observational data into one coherent picture to\nbetter understand planet formation is an important, but difficult undertaking.\nOur approach is to develop a model which can make testable predictions for all\nthese observational methods.

We present how the planetary\nmass-radius relationship of planets with primordial H/He envelopes forms and\nevolves in time. The basic shape of the M-R relation can be understood from the\ncore accretion model. Low-mass planets cannot bind massive envelopes, while\nsuper-critical cores necessarily trigger runway gas accretion, leading to\n\"forbidden\" zones in the M-R plane. For a given mass, there is a considerable\ndiversity of radii. We compare the synthetic M-R relation with the observed\none, finding good agreement for a>0.1 AU. The synthetic radius distribution is\ncharacterized by a strong increase towards small R, and a second, lower local\nmaximum at ~1 Jovian radius. The increase towards small radii reflects the\nincrease of the mass function towards low M. The second local maximum is due to\nthe fact that radii are nearly independent of mass for giant planets.

In an intermediate regime, with a\nmass range that depends on the uncertain details of rotation and mass loss\nduring the star's life, a NS is initially formed which then experiences\nfallback accretion and collapse to a BH. The electromagnetic consequence of\nsuch an event is not clear. Depending on the progenitor's structure,\npossibilities range from a long gamma-ray burst to a Type II supernova (that\nmay or may not be jet-powered) to a collapse with a weak electromagnetic\nsignature. Gravitational waves (GWs) provide the exciting opportunity to peer\nthrough the envelope of a dying massive star and directly probe what is\noccurring inside. We explore whether fallback onto young NSs can be detected by\nground-based interferometers. When the incoming material has sufficient angular\nmomentum to form a disk, the accretion spins up the NS sufficiently to produce\nnon-axisymmetric instabilities and gravitational radiation at frequencies of\n~700-2400 Hz for ~30-3000 s until collapse to a BH occurs.

Previous analysis of this cluster revealed a large\ndispersion in the line strength of the infrared Ca II triplet, suggesting an\nintrinsic star-to-star scatter in its Fe or Ca content. From our analysis, we\nassess that all the investigated stars share the same [Fe/H], [Ca/Fe] and\n[Ti/Fe] abundance ratios, while a large spread in Mg and K abundances is\ndetected. The distribution of [Mg/Fe] is bimodal, with ~40% of the observed\ntargets having subsolar [Mg/Fe], down to [Mg/Fe] ~ -1 dex, a level of\nMg-deficiency never observed before in globular clusters. It is found that the\nlarge dispersion in Mg abundances is likely the main origin of the observed\ndispersion of the Ca II triplet lines strengths (that can be erroneously\ninterpreted in terms of Fe or Ca abundance scatter) because Mg plays a relevant\nrole in the atmosphere of giant stars as an electron donor.

During the super-soft emission phase, a coherent\n7.1 hr modulation was found in the soft X-ray, UV, optical and near-IR data,\nvarying in phase across all wavebands.

We calculated the Balmer line emission and the shape of the broad\nBalmer line for parameter values suitable for SNR RCW 86 (G315.4-2.3) as a\nfunction of the cosmic-ray (CR) acceleration efficiency and of the level of\nthermal equilibration between electrons and protons behind the shock. This\ncalculation aims at using the width of the broad Balmer-line emission to infer\nthe CR acceleration efficiency in this remnant.\n  Methods. We used the recently developed nonlinear theory of diffusive\nshock-acceleration in the presence of neutrals. The semianalytical approach we\ndeveloped includes a description of magnetic field amplification as due to\nresonant streaming instability, the dynamical reaction of accelerated particles\nand the turbulent magnetic field on the shock, and all channels of interaction\nbetween neutral hydrogen atoms and background ions that are relevant for the\nshock dynamics.\n  Results. We derive the CR acceleration efficiency in the SNR RCW 86 from the\nBalmer emission. Since our calculation used recent measurements of the shock\nproper motion, the results depend on the assumed distance to Earth. For a\ndistance of 2 kpc the measured width of the broad Balmer line is compatible\nwith the absence of CR acceleration. For a distance of 2.5 kpc, which is a\nwidely used value in current literature, a CR acceleration efficiency of 5-30%\nis obtained, depending upon the electron-ion equilibration and the ionization\nfraction upstream of the shock. By combining information on Balmer emission\nwith the measured value of the downstream electron temperature, we constrain\nthe CR acceleration efficiency to be ~20%. \n\n"}

In this work, we identify informative wavelength regions in\na single-burst stellar populations model by using the CUR Matrix Decomposition.\nSimulating the Lick/IDS spectrograph configuration, we recover the widely used\nDn(4000), Hbeta, and HdeltaA to be most informative.

While most of\nthese shocks are weak and inefficient accelerators of cosmic rays (CRs), there\nare a number of strong, energetic shocks which can produce large amounts of CR\nprotons via diffusive shock acceleration.

The main difficulty in performing\nverification on a model under the posterior distribution is that in general, it\nis difficult to obtain \\emph{independent} samples from the posterior,\nespecially for non-linear dynamical models. Standard statistical model checking\nmethods require independent realizations of the system and are therefore not\napplicable in this context.\n  We propose a Markov chain Monte Carlo based statistical model checking\nframework, which produces a sequence of dependent random realizations of the\nmodel dynamics over the parameter posterior.

Both of these new\ndatasets reach a depth of at least F814W$<$27 and clearly detect the blue\nhorizontal branch (BHB) of the field as a distinct feature of the\ncolor-magnitude diagram. We measure the density of BHB stars and the ratio of\nBHB to red giant branch stars in each field using identical techniques to our\nprevious work. We find excellent agreement with our previous measurement of a\npower-law for the 2-D projected surface density with an index of\n2.6$^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$ outside of 3 kpc, which flattens to $\\alpha <$1.2 inside of\n3 kpc. Our findings confirm our previous suggestion that the field BHB stars in\nM31 are part of the halo population. However, the total halo profile is now\nknown to differ from this BHB profile, which suggests that we have isolated the\nmetal-poor component. This component appears to have an unbroken power-law\nprofile from 3-150 kpc but accounts for only about half of the total halo\nstellar mass. Discrepancies between the BHB density profile and other\nmeasurements of the inner halo are therefore likely due to the different\nprofile of the metal-rich halo component, which is not only steeper than the\nprofile of the met al-poor component, but also has a larger core radius. These\nprofile differences also help to explain the large ratio of BHB/RGB stars in\nour observations. \n\n"}

We present a study\nof 191 broad-line quasars and their host galaxies at z < 1, using high\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) spectra produced by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\nReverberation Mapping project. Clear detection of stellar absorption lines\nallows a reliable decomposition of the observed spectra into nuclear and host\ncomponents, using spectral models of quasar and stellar radiations as well as\nemission lines from the interstellar medium. We estimate age, mass (M*), and\nvelocity dispersion (sigma*) of the host stars, the star formation rate (SFR),\nquasar luminosity, and SMBH mass (Mbh), for each object. The quasars are\npreferentially hosted by massive galaxies with M* ~ 10^{11} Msun characterized\nby stellar ages around a billion years, which coincides with the transition\nphase of normal galaxies from the blue cloud to the red sequence. The host\ngalaxies have relatively low SFRs and fall below the main sequence of\nstar-forming galaxies at similar redshifts. These facts suggest that the hosts\nhave experienced an episode of major star formation sometime in the past\nbillion years, which was subsequently quenched or suppressed.

Importantly, in many\ncases, range reduction can be efficiently found even if computing the entire\nrange of $N$ is infeasible.\n  Solving equivalence checking by CRR facilitates generation of proofs of\nequivalence that mimic a \"cut propagation\" approach. A limited version of such\nan approach has been successfully used by commercial tools. Functional\nverification of a circuit $N$ by simulation can be viewed as a way to reduce\nthe complexity of computing the range of $N$. Instead of finding the entire\nrange of $N$ and checking if it contains a bad output, such a range is computed\nonly for one input. Simulation by CRR offers an alternative way of coping with\nthe complexity of range computation. The idea is to exclude a subset of inputs\nof $N$ and compute the range reduction caused by such an exclusion. If the set\nof disappeared outputs contains a bad one, then $N$ is buggy. \n\n"}

Because the ISM is turbulent, a given\npatch of ISM exhibits sub-patches with a range of surface densities. The\nhigh-density patches are 'pushed' by feedback, thereby driving turbulence and\nself-regulating local star formation. Sufficiently low-density patches,\nhowever, are accelerated to above the escape velocity before the region can\nself-adjust and are thus vented as outflows. In the\nturbulent-pressure-supported regime, when the gas fraction is $\\gtrsim 0.3$,\nthe ratio of the turbulent velocity dispersion to the circular velocity is\nsufficiently high that at any given time, of order half of the ISM has surface\ndensity less than the critical value and thus can be blown out on a dynamical\ntime.

Motivation, methodology\n  and first results from SALT Abstract: The black holes (BH) in merging BH-BH binaries are likely progeny of binary O\nstars. Their properties, including their spins, will be strongly influenced by\nthe evolution of their progenitor O stars. The remarkable observation that many\nsingle O stars spin very rapidly can be explained if they accreted angular\nmomentum from a mass-transferring, O-type or Wolf-Rayet companion before that\nstar blew up as a supernova. To test this prediction, we have measured the spin\nrates of eight O stars in Wolf-Rayet (WR) + O binaries, increasing the total\nsample size of such O stars' measured spins from two to ten. Polarimetric and\nother determinations of these systems' sin i allow us to determine an average\nequatorial rotation velocity from HeI (HeII) lines of $v_e$ = 348 (173) km/s\nfor these O stars, with individual star's $v_e$ from HeI (HeII) lines ranging\nfrom 482 (237) to 290 (91) km/s. We argue that the $\\sim$ 100\\% difference\nbetween HeI and HeII speeds is due to gravity darkening. Super-synchronous\nspins, now observed in all 10 O stars in WR + O binaries where it has been\nmeasured, are strong observational evidence that Roche lobe overflow mass\ntransfer from a WR progenitor companion has played a critical role in the\nevolution of WR+OB binaries. While theory predicts that this mass transfer\nrapidly spins-up the O-type mass gainer to a nearly break-up rotational\nvelocity $v_e \\sim 530 $ km/s, the observed average $v_e$ of the O-type stars\nin our sample is 65\\% that speed. This demonstrates that, even over the\nrelatively short WR-phase timescale, tidal and/or other effects causing\nrotational spin-down must be efficient. A challenge to tidal synchronization\ntheory is that the two longest-period binaries in our sample (with periods of\n29.7 and 78.5 days) unexpectedly display super-synchronous rotation. \n\n"}

In this paper, we provide a theory for the origin of\nthis so called \"[CII] deficit\" in galaxies. Our model treats the interstellar\nmedium as a collection of clouds with radially-stratified chemical and thermal\nproperties, which are dictated by the clouds' volume and surface densities, as\nwell as the interstellar radiation and cosmic ray fields to which they are\nexposed. [CII] emission arises from the outer, HI dominated layers of clouds,\nand from regions where the hydrogen is H2 but the carbon is predominantly C+.\nIn contrast, the most shielded regions of clouds are dominated by CO and\nproduce little [CII] emission.

After considering the electron energy\nloss due to Coulomb collisions and the ambipolar electrostatic potential, we\nfind that the sources of the superhalo could only occur high in the corona (at\na heliocentric altitude $\\gtrsim 1.9$ R$_\\odot$ (the mean radius of the Sun)),\nto remain a power-law shape of electron spectrum as observed by STEREO at 1AU\nnear solar minimum (Wang et al., 2012). The modeled quiet-Sun HXRs related to\nthe superhalo electrons fit well to a power-law spectrum, $f \\sim\n\\varepsilon^{-\\gamma}$, with an index $\\gamma$ $\\approx$ 2.0 - 2.3 (3.3 - 3.7)\nat 10 - 100 keV, for the warm/cold thick-target (thin-target) emissions\nproduced by the downward-traveling (upward-traveling) accelerated electrons.\nThese simulated quiet-Sun spectra are significantly harder than the observed\nspectra of most solar HXR flares. Assuming that the quiet-Sun sources cover 5%\nof the solar surface, the modeled thin-target HXRs are more than six orders of\nmagnitude weaker than the RHESSI upper limit for quiet-Sun HXRs (Hannah et al.,\n2010). Using the thick-target model for the downward-traveling electrons, the\nRHESSI upper limit restricts the number of downward-traveling electrons to at\nmost $\\approx$3 times the number of escaping electrons. This ratio is\nfundamentally different from what is observed during solar flares associated\nwith escaping electrons where the fraction of downward-traveling electrons\ndominates by a factor of 100 to 1000 over the escaping population. \n\n"}

We\nfind that the observed EE/BB ratio (and its scale invariance) and positive TE\ncorrelation cannot be easily explained in terms of favored models for MHD\nturbulence. The observed power-law index for temperature/polarization\nfluctuations also disfavors MHD turbulence. We thus speculate that the 0.1--30\npc length scales probed by these dust-polarization measurements are not\ndescribed by MHD turbulence but, rather, probe the large-scale physics that\ndrives ISM turbulence. We develop a simple phenomenological model, based on\nrandom displacements of the magnetized fluid, that produces EE/BB $\\simeq2$ and\na positive TE cross-correlation. According to this model, the EE/BB and TE\nsignals are due to longitudinal, rather than transverse, modes in the\nrandom-displacement field, providing, perhaps, some clue to the mechanism that\nstirs the ISM. Future investigations involving the spatial dependence of the\nEE/BB ratio, TE correlation, and local departures from statistical isotropy in\ndust-polarization maps, as well as further tests of some of the assumptions in\nthis analysis, are outlined. This work may also aid in the improvement of\nforeground-separation techniques for studies of CMB polarization. \n\n"}

In spite of the numerous studies of low-luminosity galaxies in\ndifferent environments, there is still no consensus about their formation\nscenario. In particular, a large number of galaxies displaying extremely\nlow-surface brightnesses have been detected in the last year, and the nature of\nthese objects is under discussion. Aims.

The relatively large masses of such dark-matter particles\nimply a low number density, making direct detection very challenging.

We incorporate a simple\nmolecular chemistry network and classical nucleation theory with a model for\nthe thermodynamic evolution of the post-shock gas, in order to demonstrate the\nformation of both carbon and forsterite ($\\rm Mg_2SiO_4$) grains. The high\ndensities due to radiative shock compression ($n \\sim 10^{14}$ cm$^{-3}$)\nresult in CO saturation and rapid dust nucleation.

As in dense stellar winds, dust formation\nis CO-regulated, with carbon-rich flows producing carbon-rich grains and\noxygen-rich flows primarily forming silicates. CO is destroyed by non-thermal\nparticles accelerated at the shock, allowing additional grain formation at late\ntimes, but the efficiency of this process appears to be low.

We study fluid collapse, using the close analogy\nbetween the gas entropy and the PPSD in the fluid approximation. Our\nhydrodynamic calculations allow for a precise evaluation of logarithmic\nderivatives. For scale-free initial conditions, entropy is a power law in\nLagrangian (mass) coordinates, but not in Eulerian (radial) coordinates. The\ndeviation from a radial power law arises from incomplete hydrostatic\nequilibrium (HSE), linked to bulk inflow and mass accretion, and the\nconvergence to the asymptotic central power-law slope is very slow. For more\nrealistic collapse, entropy is not a power law with either radius or mass due\nto deviations from HSE and scale-dependent initial conditions. Instead, it is a\nslowly rolling power law that appears approximately linear on a log-log plot.\nOur fluid calculations recover PPSD power-law slopes and residual amplitudes\nsimilar to N-body simulations, indicating that deviations from a power law are\nnot numerical artefacts. In addition, we find that realistic collapse is not\nself-similar: scale lengths such as the shock radius and the turnaround radius\nare not power-law functions of time.

PP utilizes the widely used Source Extractor software for source\nidentification and aperture photometry; SCAMP is used for image registration.\nBoth image registration and photometric calibration are based on matching field\nstars with star catalogs, requiring catalog coverage of the respective field.

The\nconfiguration confounds theorists as the planets are not easily explained by\neither in situ or migration models. In this Paper we present a scenario for the\nformation and orbital architecture of the TRAPPIST-1 system. In our model,\nplanet formation starts at the H2O iceline, where pebble-size particles --\nwhose origin is the outer disk -- concentrate to trigger streaming\ninstabilities. After their formation, planetary embryos quickly mature by\npebble accretion. Planet growth stalls at Earth masses, where the planet's\ngravitational feedback on the disk keeps pebbles at bay. Planets are\ntransported by Type I migration to the inner disk, where they stall at the\nmagnetospheric cavity and end up in mean motion resonances. During disk\ndispersal, the cavity radius expands and the inner-most planets escape\nresonance. We argue that the model outlined here can also be applied to other\ncompact systems and that the many close-in super-Earth systems are a scaled-up\nversion of TRAPPIST-1.

The recognition problem of $I(F)$,\nknown as Induced Subgraph Isomorphism (for the pattern graph $F$), is solvable\nin time $O(n^{W[F]})$. Motivated by this fact, we are interested in determining\nor estimating the value of $W[F]$. Using Olariu's characterization of paw-free\ngraphs, we show that $I(K_3+e)$ is definable by a first-order sentence of\nquantifier depth 3, where $K_3+e$ denotes the paw graph. This provides an\nexample of a graph $F$ with $W[F]$ strictly less than the number of vertices in\n$F$.

Classical Be stars are main-sequence\nobjects of mainly B-type, whose spectra show, or had shown at some epoch,\nBalmer lines in emission and an infrared excess.

Both stars have masses close to Solar (1.11 and\n1.14), very low metallicities ([Fe/H]=-0.50 and -0.71), and, both have Jupiter\nplanetary mass companions (m sin i=7 and 6.4 Mj), in close to terrestrial\norbits (1.4 and 1.3~au), with moderate eccentricities (e=0.34 and 0.2).\nHowever, we cannot totally exclude that the signal in the case of HD~103485 is\ndue to rotational modulation of active regions.

Besides using the angular momentum of the 15 solar-mass model\nas obtained in the stellar evolution calculation with an angular frequency of\nabout 0.001 rad/s (spin period of more than 6000 s) at the Si/Si-O interface,\nwe also computed 2D and 3D cases with no rotation and with a ~300 times shorter\nrotation period and different angular resolutions. In 2D, only the nonrotating\nand slowly rotating models explode, while rapid rotation prevents an explosion\nwithin 500 ms after bounce because of lower radiated neutrino luminosities and\nmean energies and thus reduced neutrino heating.

The amount of mass segregation\nseen in the globular clusters studied by Sollima & Baumgardt (2017) can be\nfully explained by two-body relaxation driven mass segregation from initially\nunsegregated star clusters. Based on the present-day global mass functions, we\nexpect that a typical globular cluster in our sample has lost about 75% of its\nmass since formation, while the most evolved clusters have already lost more\nthan 90% of their initial mass and should dissolve within the next 1 to 2 Gyr.\nMost clusters studied by Sollima & Baumgardt also show a large difference\nbetween their central and global MF slopes, implying that the majority of\nGalactic globular clusters is either near or already past core collapse.

However, checking invariants of such protocols is undecidable and\nhard in practice, as it requires reasoning about an unbounded number of nodes\nand messages.

The latter measures the relative contribution of\nPAH molecules to the LIR. We used this library to model star-forming galaxies\nat 0.5<z<4 in the CANDELS fields, using both individual detections and stacks\nof Herschel and ALMA imaging, and extending this sample to z=0 using the\nHerschel Reference Survey. At first order, the dust SED of a galaxy was found\nindependent of stellar mass, but evolving with redshift.

Half\nof the observed variation of these parameters was captured by these empirical\nrelations, with residual scatters of 12% and 0.18 dex, respectively.

Building on these results, we\nconstructed high-fidelity mock galaxy catalogs to predict the accuracy of LIR\nand Mdust determined from a single flux measurement.

In this paper, we present a high-resolution chemo-hydrodynamical\nsimulation of the entire Milky-Way Galaxy, including stochastic star formation,\nHII regions, SNe, and element injection, that allows us to measure for the\ndistribution of 60Fe/56Fe and 26Al/27Al ratios over all stars in the Galaxy.

To statically check such specifications, our framework infers\nthe same type of resource usage functions, which safely approximate the actual\nresource usage of the program, and compares them against the specification.

We conduct a suite of radiation hydrodynamic simulations of\nstar cluster formation in marginally-bound, turbulent GMCs, focusing on the\neffects of photoionization and radiation pressure on regulating the net star\nformation efficiency (SFE) and cloud lifetime.

To correct this, we develop an\nabstract framework for relational parametricity that generalizes the notion of\na reflexive graph categories and delivers Reynolds' model as a direct instance\nin a natural way. This framework is uniform with respect to a choice of\nmeta-theory, which allows us to obtain the well-known PER model of Longo and\nMoggi as a direct instance in a natural way as well.

In contrast,\nquasi-perpendicular shocks do not efficiently accelerate ions. We model this\nobliquity-dependent acceleration process in a spherically expanding blast wave\nsetup with the moving-mesh code {\\sc arepo} for different magnetic field\nmorphologies, ranging from homogeneous to turbulent configurations. A\nSedov-Taylor explosion in a homogeneous magnetic field generates an oblate\nellipsoidal shock surface due to the slower propagating blast wave in the\ndirection of the magnetic field. This is because of the efficient cosmic ray\n(CR) production in the quasi-parallel polar cap regions, which softens the\nequation of state and increases the compressibility of the post-shock gas. We\nfind that the solution remains self-similar because the ellipticity of the\npropagating blast wave stays constant in time. This enables us to derive an\neffective ratio of specific heats for a composite of thermal gas and CRs as a\nfunction of the maximum acceleration efficiency. We finally discuss the\nbehavior of supernova remnants expanding into a turbulent magnetic field with\nvarying coherence lengths. For a maximum CR acceleration efficiency of about 15\nper cent at quasi-parallel shocks (as suggested by kinetic plasma simulations),\nwe find an average efficiency of about 5 per cent, independent of the assumed\nmagnetic coherence length. \n\n"}

Robotic cell injection systems provide the automation of the process as\nopposed to the manual and semi-automated cell injection systems, which require\nexpert operators and involve time consuming processes and also have lower\nsuccess rates. The automation of the cell injection process is achieved by\ncontrolling the injection force and planning the motion of the injection\npipette.

Its solution amounts to a function mapping variables to constant\nstrings that equate the left and right hand sides of the equation.

This\ndemonstrates that there is a continuum of dip durations from a day to a\ncentury, so that the secular fading is seen to be by the same physical\nmechanism as the short-duration Kepler dips. The BVRI light curves all have the\nsame shape, with the slopes and amplitudes for VRI being systematically smaller\nthan in the B-band by factors of 0.77 +- 0.05, 0.50 +- 0.05, and 0.31 +- 0.05.\nWe rule out any hypothesis involving occultation of the primary star by any\nstar, planet, solid body, or optically thick cloud. But these ratios are the\nsame as that expected for ordinary extinction by dust clouds. This chromatic\nextinction implies dust particle sizes going down to ~0.1 micron, suggesting\nthat this dust will be rapidly blown away by stellar radiation pressure, so the\ndust clouds must have formed within months. The modern infrared observations\nwere taken at a time when there was at least 12.4% +- 1.3% dust coverage (as\npart of the secular dimming), and this is consistent with dimming originating\nin circumstellar dust. \n\n"}

The IMF is a\nhilfskonstrukt. It is a mathematical formulation of an idealised population of\nstars formed together in one star formation event. The nature of the IMF (is it\na probability density or an optimal sampling distribution function?) is raised.\nBinary stars, if unresolved, have a very significant influence at low stellar\nmasses. Especially important is to take care of the changing binary fraction as\na result of stellar-dynamical evolution of the embedded clusters which spawn\nthe field populations of galaxies, given that the binary fraction at birth is\nvery high and independent of primary-star mass. The high multiplicity fraction\namongst massive stars leads to a substantial fraction of these being ejected\nout of their birth clusters and to massive stars merging. This explains the\ntop-lightness of the IMF in star clusters in M31. In close binaries also the\nmasses of the components can be changed due to mass transfer. A large amount of\nevidence points to the IMF becoming top-heavy with decreasing metallicity and\nabove a star-formation-rate density of about 0.1 Msun/(pc^3 yr) of the\ncluster-forming cloud core. This is also indicated through the observed\nsupernova rates in star-bursting galaxies. At the same time, the IMF may be\nbottom light at low metallicity and bottom-heavy at high metallicity, possibly\naccounting for the results on elliptical galaxies and ultra-faint dwarf\ngalaxies, respectively. \n\n"}

New algorithms need to be developed to\nextract reliable catalogs of linearly polarized sources that can be used to\ncharacterize those sources and produce a dense rotation measure (RM) grid to\nprobe magneto-ionized structures along the line of sight via Faraday rotation.\nThe aim of the paper is to develop a computationally efficient and rigorously\ndefined source-finding algorithm for linearly polarized sources.

With a new\nimaging software, we re-imaged the field at a resolution of 18''x15'' and\ncataloged a total of about 3000 continuum sources within 2.5 degrees of the\ncenter of M51. We made small Stokes Q and U images centered on each source\nbrighter than 100 mJy in total intensity (201 sources) and used RM synthesis to\ncreate corresponding Faraday cubes that were analyzed individually. For each\nsource, the noise distribution function was determined from a subset of\nmeasurements at high Faraday depths where no polarization is expected; the\npeaks in polarized intensity in the Faraday spectrum were identified and the\np-value of each source was calculated. Finally, the false discovery rate method\nwas applied to the list of p-values to produce a list of polarized sources and\nquantify the reliability of the detections.

These high-resolution\nspectra reveal a contribution to the SO emission from gas reservoirs at both\nhigh and low rotational temperatures. The scenario preferred by de Pater et al.\n(2002) for the source of the SO gas - direct volcanic emission of SO in the\nexcited state - is consistent with these two temperature components if the\nlocal gas density is high enough that rotational energy can be lost\ncollisionally before the excited electronic state spontaneously decays.

If\nthese BBHs are the product of binary evolution, then PPISNe could occur in very\nclose binaries. Motivated by this, we discuss the implications of a PPISN\nhappening with a close binary companion, and what impact these events have on\nthe formation of merging BBHs through binary evolution. For this, we have\ncomputed a set of models of metal-poor ($Z_\\odot/10$) single helium stars using\nthe \\texttt{MESA} software instrument. For PPISN progenitors with pre-pulse\nmasses $>50M_\\odot$ we find that, after a pulse, heat deposited throughout the\nlayers of the star that remain bound cause it to expand to more than\n$100R_\\odot$ for periods of $10^2-10^4\\;$~yrs depending on the mass of the\nprogenitor.

The presence of a disk is usually inferred from the system's spectral\nenergy distribution (SED), and confirmed, for a sub-sample, by interferometric\nobservations. We used the Spectro-Polarimetric High-contrast Exoplanet REsearch\n(SPHERE) instrument on the Very Large Telescope to obtain extreme adaptive\noptics assisted scattered light images of the post-AGB binary system AR Puppis.\nData have been obtained in the V, I, and H bands.

We consider a\n``collisional starburst'' model in which bursts of star formation are triggered\nby galaxy-galaxy mergers, and find that a significant fraction of LBGs are\npredicted to be starbursts. This model reproduces the observed comoving number\ndensity of bright LBGs as a function of redshift and the observed luminosity\nfunction at $z\\sim 3$ and $z\\sim 4$, with a reasonable amount of dust\nextinction. Model galaxies at $z \\sim 3$ have star formation rates, half-light\nradii, I-K colours, and internal velocity dispersions that are in good\nagreement with the data. Global quantities such as the star formation rate\ndensity and cold gas and metal content of the Universe as a function of\nredshift also agree well.

We regard this\nas a warning not to draw general cosmological conclusions from cluster samples\nwith a size smaller than REFLEX. Power spectra, P(k), of comoving cluster\nnumber densities are estimated for flux- and volume-limited subsamples. The\nmost important result is the detection of a broad maximum within the comoving\nwavenumber range 0.022<k<0.030 h/Mpc. The data suggest an increase of the power\nspectral amplitude with X-ray luminosity. Compared to optically selected\ncluster samples the REFLEX P(k)is flatter for wavenumbers k<0.05 h/Mpc thus\nshifting the maximum of P(k) to larger scales.

These galaxies, as measured from SDSS and\nin the Local Group, show tight correlations of internal velocity, metallicity\nand surface brightness (or radius) with M*. They define a fundamental line\ndistinguishing them from the brighter galaxies of high surface brightness and\nmetallicity. The idealized model assumes spherical collapse of CDM haloes to\nvirial equilibrium and angular-momentum conservation. The relations for bright\ngalaxies are reproduced by assuming that M* is a constant fraction of the halo\nmass M. The upper bound to the low-luminosity LSBs coincides with the virial\nvelocity of haloes in which supernova feedback could significantly suppress\nstar formation, V<100km/s (Dekel & Silk 1986). We argue that the energy fed to\nthe gas obeys E_sn \\prop M* despite the radiative losses, and equate it with\nthe binding energy of the gas to obtain M*/M \\prop V^2. This idealized model\nprovides surprisingly good fits to the scaling relations of low-luminosity LSBs\nand dwarfs, which indicates that supernova feedback had a primary role in\ndetermining the fundamental line. The apparent lower bound for galaxies at\nV~10km/s may be due to the cooling barrier at T~10^4 K. Some fraction of the\ndark haloes may show no stars due to complete gas removal either by supernova\nwinds from neighboring galaxies or by radiative feedback after cosmological\nreionization at z_ion. Radiative feedback may also explain the distinction\nbetween dwarf spheroidals (dE) and irregulars (dI), where the dEs of V<30km/s\nform stars before z_ion and are then cleaned out of gas, while the dIs with\nV>30km/s retain gas-rich discs with feedback-regulated star formation. \n\n"}

This review surveys all observational data searching for\nan evolution and/or extinction, according to host morphology. For instance, it\nhas been observed that high-z SNe Ia have bluer colours than the local ones:\nalthough this goes against extinction to explain why SN are dimmer with\nredshift until z ~ 1, supporting a decelerating universe, it also demonstrates\nintrinsic evolution effects. -- SNe Ia could evolve because the age and\nmetallicity of their progenitors evolve. The main parameter is carbon\nabundance. Smaller C leads to a dimmer SN Ia and also less scatter on peak\nbrightness, as it is the case in elliptical galaxy today. Age of the progenitor\nis an important factor: young populations lead to brighter SNe Ia, as in spiral\ngalaxies, and a spread in ages lead to a larger scatter, explaining the\nobserved lower scatter at high z. -- Selection biases also play a role, like\nthe Malmquist bias; high-z SNe Ia are found at larger distance from their host\ncenter: there is more obscuration in the center, and also detection is easier\nwith no contamination from the center. This might be one of the reason why less\nobscuration has been found for SNe Ia at high z. -- There is clearly a sample\nevolution with z: currently only the less bright SNe Ia are detected at high z,\nwith less scatter. The brightest objects have a slowly declining light-curve,\nand at high z, no slow decline has been observed. This may be interpreted as an\nage effect, high-z SN having younger progenitors. \n\n"}

The variation of the indices of\nconcentration and asymmetry with the wavelength reflects the proportion and the\ndistribution of young and old stellar populations in galaxies. In general C is\nfound to decrease from optical to UV, and A is found to increase from optical\nto UV: the patchy appearance of galaxies in UV with no bulge is often very\ndifferent from their counterpart at optical wavelengths, with prominent bulges\nand more regular disks. The variation of C and A with the wavelength is\nquantified. By this way, we are able to distinguish five types of galaxies that\nwe call spectro-morphological types: compact, ringed, spiral, irregular and\ncentral-starburst galaxies, which can be differentiated by the repartition of\ntheir stellar populations.

This accretion-ejection paradigm provides a simple\nexplanation to the canonical spectral states by varying the transition radius\nr_J and disc accretion rate independently. Large values of r_J correspond to\nthe Quiescent state for low $\\dot m$ and the Hard state for larger $\\dot m$.\nThese states are characterized by the presence of a steady electron-proton MHD\njet emitted by the disc below r_J.

The most popular progenitor model invokes the merger of either double\nneutron star (DNS) binaries or neutron star-black hole (NS-BH) systems. Such\nevents are strong sources of gravitational-waves (GWs) and might be detected by\nground-based GW observatories. In this work we combine the census of SHB\nobservations with refined theoretical analysis to perform a critical evaluation\nof the compact binary model. We then explore the implications for GW detection\nof these events. Beginning from the measured star-formation rate through cosmic\ntime, we consider what intrinsic luminosity and lifetime distributions can\nreproduce the known SHB redshifts and luminosities as well as the peak flux\ndistribution of the large BATSE SHB sample. We find that: (1) The typical\nprogenitor lifetime is long. Assuming lognormal lifetime distribution the\ntypical lifetime is >4[1] Gyr (2[3]\\sigma c.l.). If the lifetime distribution\nis a power-law with index \\eta then \\eta>-0.5 [-1] (2[3] \\sigma c.l.). This\nresult is difficult to reconcile with the properties of the observed galactic\nDNS population, suggesting that if SHBs do result from DNS mergers then the\nobserved galactic binaries do not represent the cosmic one. (2) We find that\nthe local rate of SHBs is larger than 10Gpc^-3/yr and may be higher by several\norders of magnitude, significantly above previous estimates. (3) Assuming that\nSHBs do result from compact binaries, our predictions for the LIGO and VIRGO\nevent rates are encouraging: The chance for detection by current facilities is\nnot negligible, while a coincident detection of GW and electromagnetic\nradiation from an SHB is guaranteed for next-generation observatories. \n\n"}

When\ncompared to stellar-mass black holes, the low disc temperatures observed in\nsome ULXs may imply intermediate-mass black hole primaries.

The current-carrying,\nPoynting flux-dominated magnetic tower jet, which possesses a highly wound\nhelical magnetic field, is subject to the current-driven instability (CDI). We\nfind that, under general physical conditions including small perturbations in\nthe initial background profiles, the propagating magnetic tower jets develop\nthe non-axisymmetric, $m=1$ kink mode of the CDI. The kink mode grows on the\nlocal Alfv\\'en crossing time scale. In addition, two types of kink modes appear\nin the system. At the central region where external thermal pressure\nconfinement is strong, only the internal kink mode is excited and will grow. A\nlarge distance away from the central region where the external thermal pressure\nbecomes low, the external kink mode is observed. As a result, the exterior of\nmagnetic tower jets will be deformed into a large-scale wiggled structure. We\nalso discuss extensively the different physical processes that contribute to\nthe overall stability properties of the magnetic tower jets. Specifically, when\nthe jet propagates in an initially unperturbed background, we find that they\ncan survive the kink mode beyond the point predicted by the well-known\nKruskal-Shafranov (K-S) criterion. The stabilization in this case comes mainly\nfrom the dynamical relaxation of magnetic twists during the propagation of\nmagnetic towers; the magnetic pitch is reduced and the corresponding K-S\ncritical wavelength becomes longer as the tower jet proceeds. Furthermore, we\nshow that the pressure-driven and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities do not occur\nin the magnetic tower jets. \n\n"}

We introduce scatter in galaxy luminosity at fixed halo\nmass into this model, building a conditional luminosity function (CLF) by\nconsidering two possible models: a simple lognormal and a model based on the\ndistribution of concentration in haloes of a given mass. We show that this\nmodel naturally allows an identification of halo/subhalo systems with groups\nand clusters of galaxies, giving rise to a clear central/satellite galaxy\ndistinction.\n  We then use these results to build up the dependence of brightest cluster\ngalaxy (BCG) magnitudes on cluster luminosity, focusing on two statistical\nindicators, the dispersion in BCG magnitude and the magnitude difference\nbetween first and second brightest galaxies.

It has been suggested that these planets are in a\nresonance involving persistent misalignment and synchronous precession of their\nspin and orbital angular momenta, a Cassini state, and that the attendant tidal\nheating inflates the planet. We argue against this. Using explicit tidal\nintegrations, we show that although an oblique Cassini state can dissipate many\ntimes the rotational energy of the planet, the rate of dissipation must be much\nless than hypothesized. Dissipation causes the planetary spin to lie at an\nangle to the plane containing the orbital and total angular momenta. If\ndissipation is too rapid, this angle becomes so large that Cassini equilibrium\nis lost. A separate consideration limits the total energy that can be extracted\nfrom the orbit. The source of the torque on the orbit, either an oblique parent\nstar or an inclined third body, aligns with the orbit as it absorbs the angular\nmomentum shed by the planet. Alignment removes the orbital precession required\nby the Cassini state.

Scalar (density) fluctuations do not rotate neither the plane\nof polarization of the electromagnetic radiation nor the source image.

In sources with large ellipticity the apparent rotation is rather\nsmall, of the order (in radians) of the dimensionless shear. The effect is\nlarger at smaller source eccentricity. A shear of 1% can induce apparent\nrotations of around 5 degrees in radio sources with the smallest eccentricity\namong those with a significant degree of integrated linear polarization.

Pair Loading and\n  Radiative Acceleration in Gamma-ray Bursts Abstract: We consider the effects of rapid pair creation by an intense pulse of\ngamma-rays propagating ahead of a relativistic shock. Side-scattered photons\ncolliding with the main gamma-ray beam amplify the density of scattering\ncharges. The acceleration rate of the pair-loaded medium is calculated, and its\nlimiting bulk Lorentz factor related to the spectrum and compactness of the\nphoton source. One obtains, as a result, a definite prediction for the relative\ninertia in baryons and pairs. The deceleration of a relativistic shock in the\nmoving medium, and the resulting synchrotron emissivity, are compared with\nexisting calculations for a static medium. The radiative efficiency is\nincreased dramatically by pair loading. When the initial ambient density\nexceeds a critical value, the scattering depth traversed by the main gamma-ray\npulse rises above unity, and the pulse is broadened. These considerations place\nsignificant constraints on burst progenitors: a pre-burst mass loss rate\nexceeding 10^{-5} M_\\odot per year is difficult to reconcile with individual\npulses narrower than 10 s, unless the radiative efficiency is low. An\nanisotropic gamma-ray flux (on an angular scale \\Gamma^{-1} or larger) drives a\nlarge velocity shear that greatly increases the energy in the seed magnetic\nfield forward of the propagating shock. \n\n"}

The classes of examples\ninclude boundary branes on generalised S-brane backgrounds and probe branes in\nD-brane/anti D-brane systems. The bounces we consider normally would be\nexpected to require an energy density which violates the weak energy condition,\nand for our co-dimension one examples this is attributable to bulk curvature\nterms in the effective Friedmann equation. We examine the features of the\nacceleration which provides the bounce, including in some cases the existence\nof positive acceleration without event horizons, and we give a geometrical\ninterpretation for it. We discuss the stability of the solutions from the point\nof view of both the brane and the bulk. Some of our examples appear to be\nstable from the bulk point of view, suggesting the possible existence of stable\nbouncing cosmologies within the brane-world framework. \n\n"}
{"id": "hep-th/0403203", "contents": "Title: An Inflationary Model in String Theory Abstract: We construct a model of inflation in string theory after carefully taking\ninto account moduli stabilization. The setting is a warped compactification of\nType IIB string theory in the presence of D3 and anti-D3-branes. The inflaton\nis the position of a D3-brane in the internal space. By suitably adjusting\nfluxes and the location of symmetrically placed anti-D3-branes, we show that at\na point of enhanced symmetry, the inflaton potential V can have a broad\nmaximum, satisfying the condition V''/V << 1 in Planck units. On starting close\nto the top of this potential the slow-roll conditions can be met. Observational\nconstraints impose significant restrictions. As a first pass we show that these\ncan be satisfied and determine the important scales in the compactification to\nwithin an order of magnitude. One robust feature is that the scale of inflation\nis low, H = O(10^{10}) GeV. Removing the observational constraints makes it\nmuch easier to construct a slow-roll inflationary model. Generalizations and\nconsequences including the possibility of eternal inflation are also discussed.\nA more careful study, including explicit constructions of the model in string\ntheory, is left for the future. \n\n"}

The cosmic string tension is very\nsensitive to the conformal coupling: with less fine-tuning, the cosmic string\ntension (as well as the ratio of tensor to scalar perturbation mode) increases\nrapidly and can easily saturate the present observational bound. In a\nmulti-throat brane inflationary scenario, this feature substantially improves\nthe chance of detecting and measuring the properties of the cosmic strings as a\nwindow to the superstring theory and our pre-inflationary universe. \n\n"}

A notable example is the kaon which plays\nspecial roles in all the three fields. In this paper, we first review the\nvarious theoretical investigations of kaon properties in nuclear medium,\nfocusing on possible uncertainties in each model. We then present a detailed\ntransport model study of kaon production in heavy-ion collisions at SIS\nenergies. We shall discuss especially the elementary kaon and antikaon\nproduction cross sections in hadron-hadron interactions, that represent one of\nthe most serious uncertainties in the transport model study of particle\nproduction in heavy-ion collisions. The main purpose of such a study is to\nconstrain kaon in-medium properties from the heavy-ion data. This can provide\nuseful guidances for the development of theoretical models of the kaon in\nmedium. In the last part of the paper, we apply the kaon in-medium properties\nextracted from heavy-ion data to the study of neutron star properties.
