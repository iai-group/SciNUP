Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days.

As young AGN\n(quasars) they are initially several magnitudes sub-luminous to mature galaxies\nbut their luminosity gradually increases over 10^8 yrs, as z_(i) decreases and\nthey evolve into mature AGN (Seyferts and radio galaxies). Evidence presented\nhere that low- and intermediate-redshift AGN are unquestionably sub-luminous to\nradio galaxies is then strong support for this model and makes it likely that\nthe high-redshift AGN (quasars) are also sub-luminous, having simply been\npushed above the radio galaxies on a logz-m_(v) plot by the presence of a large\nintrinsic component in their redshifts.

Contrary to conventional wisdom, IR luminosity does not dictate OHM\nformation; both star formation and OHM activity are consequences of tidal\ndensity enhancements accompanying galaxy interactions. The OHM fraction in\nstarbursts is likely due to the fraction of mergers experiencing a temporal\nspike in tidally driven density enhancement. OHMs are thus signposts marking\nthe most intense, compact, and unusual modes of star formation in the local\nuniverse. Future high redshift OHM surveys can now be interpreted in a star\nformation and galaxy evolution context, indicating both the merging rate of\ngalaxies and the burst contribution to star formation. \n\n"}

The introduction\nof an inhomogeneous disk leads to differences in the formation of a wind, most\nnoticeably the absence of the ``blow-out'' effect seen in homogeneous models. A\nwind forms from a series of small bubbles that propagate into the tenuous gas\nbetween dense clouds in the disk.

The MWA is\nsensitive to roughly a decade in scale (wavenumbers of k ~ 0.1 - 1 h Mpc^{-1}),\nwith foreground contamination precluding measurements on larger scales, and\nthermal detector noise limiting the small scale sensitivity. This amounts\nprimarily to constraints on two numbers: the amplitude and slope of the 21 cm\npower spectrum on the scales probed. We find, however, that the redshift\nevolution in these quantities can yield important information about\nreionization. Although the power spectrum differs substantially across\nplausible models, a generic prediction is that the amplitude of the 21 cm power\nspectrum on MWA scales peaks near the epoch when the intergalactic medium (IGM)\nis ~ 50% ionized. Moreover, the slope of the 21 cm power spectrum on MWA scales\nflattens as the ionization fraction increases and the sizes of the HII regions\ngrow.

The AGN are selected such that their rest-frame UV\nto near-IR SEDs are dominated by stellar emission, i.e., they show a prominent\n1.6micron bump, thus minimizing the AGN emission 'contamination'. This AGN\npopulation comprises approximately 50% of the X-ray selected AGN at these\nredshifts. Using models of stellar and dust emission we model their SEDs to\nderive stellar masses (M*) and total (UV+IR) star formation rates (SFR). AGN\nreside in the most massive galaxies at the redshifts probed here. Their\ncharacteristic stellar masses (M*~7.8x10^10 Msun and M*~1.2x10^11 Msun at\nmedian z of 0.67 and 1.07, respectively) appear to be representative of the\nX-ray selected AGN population at these redshifts, and are intermediate between\nthose of local type 2 AGN and high redshift (z~2) AGN. The inferred black hole\nmasses (MBH~ 2x10^8 Msun) of typical AGN are similar to those of optically\nidentified quasars at similar redshifts. Since the AGN in our sample are much\nless luminous (L(2-10keV)<10^44 erg/s) than quasars, typical AGN have low\nEddington ratios (eta~0.01-0.001). This suggests that, at least at intermediate\nz, the cosmic AGN 'downsizing' is due to both a decrease in the characteristic\nstellar mass of typical host galaxies, and less efficient accretion. Finally\nthere is no strong evidence in AGN host galaxies for either highly suppressed\nSF (expected if AGN played a role in quenching SF) or elevated SF when compared\nto mass selected (i.e., IRAC-selected) galaxies of similar stellar masses and\nredshifts.

We model the galaxy as a\ngravitationally-coupled system of stars and gas, responding to the external\nforce-field of a known Hernquist bulge and the dark matter halo, the density\nprofile of the latter being characterized by four free parameters. The\nparameter space of the halo is optimized so as to match the observed HI\nthickness distribution as well as the rotation curve on an equal footing,\nunlike the previous studies of M31 which were based on rotation curves alone.\nWe show that an oblate halo, with an isothermal density profile, provides the\nbest fit to the observed data.

In\nboth, ignoring the effects of gas in mergers leads to the over-production of\nspheroids: low and intermediate-mass galaxies are predicted to be\nbulge-dominated (B/T~0.5 at <10^10 M_sun), with almost no bulgeless systems),\neven if they have avoided major mergers.

The linear analysis shows that the power spectrum\nbelow the so-called filtering scale is suppressed relative to the power\nspectrum of the cold dark matter. Our non-linear calculation shows that the\nactual filtering scale for a given sound speed is smaller than the linear\nfiltering scale by a factor depending on the redshift and the Jeans length.

We also describe an analytical approach for the determination of CB-BLS\ndetection limits, and a method for the correct detrending of\nintrinsically-variable stars.\n  Results. We present some blind-tests with simulated planets injected to real\nCoRoT data. The presented upgrades to CB-BLS allowed it to detect all the blind\ntests successfully, and these detections were in line with the detection limits\nanalysis. We also correctly detrend bright eclipsing binaries from observations\nby the TrES planet search, and present some of the first results of applying\nCB-BLS to multiple real light curves from a wide-field survey.\n  Conclusions. CB-BLS is now mature enough for its application to real data,\nand the presented processing scheme will serve as the template for our future\napplications of CB-BLS to data from wide-field surveys such as CoRoT. Being\nable to put constraints even on non-detection will help to determine the\ncorrect frequency of CB planets, contributing to the understanding of planet\nformation in general. Still, searching for transiting CB planets is still a\nlearning experience, similarly to the state of transiting planets around single\nstars only a few years ago. The recent rapid progress in this front, coupled\nwith the exquisite quality of space-based photometry, allows to realistically\nexpect that if transiting CB planets exist - then they will soon be found. \n\n"}

Detailed knowledge\nof the physical mechanisms that govern stellar birth is a prerequisite for\nunderstanding the formation and evolution of our galactic home, the Milky Way.\nA theory of star formation is an essential part of any model for the origin of\nour solar system and of planets around other stars. Despite this pivotal\nimportance, and despite many decades of research, our understanding of the\nprocesses that initiate and regulate star formation is still limited.\n  Stars are born in cold interstellar clouds of molecular hydrogen gas. Star\nformation in these clouds is governed by the complex interplay between the\ngravitational attraction in the gas and agents such as turbulence, magnetic\nfields, radiation and thermal pressure that resist compression. The competition\nbetween these processes determines both the locations at which young stars form\nand how much mass they ultimately accrete. It plays out over many orders of\nmagnitude in space and time, ranging from galactic to stellar scales. In\naddition, star formation is a highly stochastic process in which rare and\nhard-to-predict events, such as the formation of very massive stars and the\nresulting feedback, can play a dominant role in determining the evolution of a\nstar-forming cloud.\n  As a consequence of the wide range of scales and processes that control star\nformation, analytic models are usually restricted to highly idealized cases.\nThese can yield insight, but the complexity of the problem means that they must\nbe used in concert with large-scale numerical simulations.

The origin of the radio emission is\nunclear,it could be due either to a jet, as in microquasars, or to the shock\nboundary between the Be star and a possible pulsar wind. We here analyze the\nradio spectral index over 6.7 yr from Green Bank Interferometer data at 2.2 GHz\nand 8.3 GHz. We find two new characteristics in the radio emission. The first\ncharacteristic is that the periodic outbursts indeed consist of two consecutive\noutbursts; the first outburst is optically thick, whereas the second outburst\nis optically thin. The spectrum of LS I +61 303 is well reproduced by the\nshock-in-jet model commonly used in the context of microquasars and AGNs: the\noptically thin spectrum is due to shocks caused by relativistic plasma\n(\"transient jet\") traveling through a pre-existing much slower steady flow\n(\"steady jet\"). This steady flow is responsible for the preceding optically\nthick spectrum. The second characteristic we find is that the observed spectral\nevolution, from optically thick to optically thin emission, occurs twice during\nthe orbital period. We observed this occurrence at the orbital phase of the\nmain 26.5 d outburst and also at an earlier phase, shifted by $\\Delta \\Phi\n\\sim$ 0.3 (i.e almost 8 days before). We show that this result qualitatively\nand quantitatively agrees with the two-peak accretion/ejection model proposed\nin the past for LS I +61303.

The spectrum of the\nstar is then no longer the same as when it is unmagnified, and measurements of\nthe atmospheric parameters and abundances will be affected. The accuracy of\nabundances measured from spectra taken during microlensing events has become\nimportant recently because of the use of highly magnified dwarf stars to probe\nabundance ratios and the abundance distribution in the Galactic bulge. In this\npaper, we investigate the effect of finite source effects on spectra by using\nmagnification profiles motivated by two events to synthesize spectra for dwarfs\nbetween 5000K to 6200K at solar metallicity. We adopt the usual techniques for\nanalyzing the microlensed dwarfs, namely, spectroscopic determination of\ntemperature, gravity, and microturbulent velocity, relying on equivalent\nwidths.

Using the new optical\nclassifications afforded by the extremely large data set of the Sloan Digital\nSky Survey, we find that the fraction of LINERs in IR-selected samples is rare\n(< 5%) compared with other spectral types. The lack of strong infrared emission\nin LINERs is consistent with recent optical studies suggesting that LINERs\ncontain AGN with lower accretion rates than in Seyfert galaxies. Most\npreviously classified infrared-luminous LINERs are classified as starburst-AGN\ncomposite galaxies in the new scheme.

We find that these models predict\ntoo many passive satellite galaxies in clusters, too few passive central\ngalaxies with low stellar masses, and too many passive central galaxies with\nhigh masses. We then outline a series of modifications to the model necessary\nto solve these problems: a) Instead of instantaneous stripping of the external\ngas reservoir after a galaxy becomes a satellite, the gas supply is assumed to\ndecrease at the same rate that the surrounding halo loses mass due to tidal\nstripping, b) The AGN feedback efficiency is lowered to bring the fraction of\nmassive passive centrals in better agreement with the data. We also allow for\nradio mode AGN feedback in satellite galaxies. c) We assume that satellite\ngalaxies residing in host haloes with masses below 10^12 M_sun do not undergo\nany stripping. We highlight the fact that in low mass galaxies, the external\nreservoir is composed primarily of gas that has been expelled from the galactic\ndisk by supernovae driven winds. This gas must remain available as a future\nreservoir for star formation, even in satellite galaxies.

Over time, the same\nultracompact H II region can expand anisotropically, contract again, and take\non any of the observed morphological classes. In their extended phases,\nexpanding H II regions drive bipolar neutral outflows characteristic of\nhigh-mass star formation. The total lifetime of H II regions is given by the\nglobal accretion timescale, rather than their short internal sound-crossing\ntime. The pressure of the hot, ionized gas does not terminate accretion.\nInstead the final stellar mass is set by fragmentation-induced starvation.\nLocal gravitational instabilities in the accretion flow lead to the build-up of\na small cluster of stars, all with relatively high masses due to heating from\naccretion radiation.

In this review, I focus on the possible\ncentral engines of long-duration GRBs, and the constraints that present\nobservations place on these models. Long GRBs are definitively associated with\nthe deaths of massive stars, but whether the central engine is an accreting\nblack hole or a rapidly-spinning, highly-magnetized neutron star (a\n\"proto-magnetar\") remains unsettled. This distinction has been brought into\nparticular focus by recent MHD simulations of the core-collapse of massive,\nrotating \"collapsar progenitors,\" which suggest that powerful\nmagneto-centrifugal outflows from the proto-neutron star may stave off black\nhole formation entirely.

For this discovery, Hess was awarded\nthe Nobel Prize in 1936, and his experiment became legendary.\n  Shortly before, in 1911, Pacini, a professor at the University of Bari, made\na series of measurements to determine the variation in the speed of discharge\nof an electroscope (and thus the intensity of the radiation) while the\nelectroscope was immersed in a box in a sea near the Naval Academy in the Bay\nof Livorno (the Italian Navy supported the research).

However, we find that\none can fit the peak positions by appropriately modifying the LTB model,\nnamely, by allowing the deviation of the distance-redshift relation from that\nof the concordance $\\Lambda$CDM model at $z>2$ where no observational data are\navailable at present. Thus there is still a possibility of explaining the\napparent accelerated expansion of the universe by inhomogeneity without\nresorting to dark energy if we abandon the Copernican principle. Even if we do\nnot take this extreme attitude, it also suggests that local, isotropic\ninhomogeneities around us may seriously affect the determination of the density\ncontents of the universe unless the possible existence of such inhomogeneities\nis properly taken into account. \n\n"}

We improve upon the existing\nresults for the mass function by combining path integral methods and saddle\npoint techniques (which have been separately applied in previous approaches).\nAdditionally, we carefully account for the various scale dependent combinations\nof small parameters which appear. Some of these combinations in fact become of\norder unity for large mass scales and at high redshifts, and must therefore be\ntreated non-perturbatively. Our approach allows us to do this, and to also\naccount for multi-scale density correlations which appear in the calculation.\nWe thus derive an accurate expression for the mass function which is based on\napproximations that are valid over a larger range of mass scales and redshifts\nthan those of other authors.

Vortices have the ability to sequester particles, with\ntypical radii from about 1 mm to 10 cm, that are slightly decoupled from the\ngas. A generic feature of discs with surface density and effective temperature\nprofiles that are decreasing, power-law functions of radial distance is that\nfour vortex zones exist for a fixed particle size. In particular, two of the\nzones form an annulus at intermediate radial distances within which small\nparticles reside. Particle capture by vortices occurs on a dynamical time scale\nnear and at the boundaries of this annulus. As the disc ages and the particles\ngrow via coagulation, the size of the annulus shrinks. Older discs prefer to\ncapture smaller particles because the gas surface density decreases with time,\na phenomenon we term \"vortex aging\". More viscous, more dust-opaque and/or less\nmassive discs can have vortices that age faster and trap a broader range of\nparticle sizes throughout the lifetime of the disc. Thus, how efficiently a\ndisc retains its mass in solids depends on the relative time scales between\ncoagulation and vortex aging.

Here we present our\ndatabase of observations, with three simultaneous energy bands in both the\noptical and the X-ray, and multiple epochs of observation for each source, all\nwith ~second or better time resolution. For the first time, we include a\ndynamical cross-correlation analysis, i.e., an investigation of how the\ncross-correlation function changes within an observation. We describe a number\nof trends which emerge. We include the full dataset of results, and pick a few\nstriking relationships from among them for further discussion. We find, that\nthe surprising form of X-ray/optical cross-correlation functions, a positive\ncorrelation signal preceded by an anti-correlation signal, is seen in all the\nsources at least some of the time. Such behaviour suggests a mechanism other\nthan reprocessing as being the dominant driver of the short-term variability in\nthe optical emission. This behaviour appears more pronounced when the X-ray\nspectrum is hard. Furthermore, we find that the cross-correlation relationships\nthemselves are not stable in time, but vary significantly in strength and form.\nThis all hints at dynamic interactions between the emitting components which\ncould be modelled through non-linear or differential relationships. \n\n"}

We derive and analyze the absorption\ndistribution using a complete sample of AGN detected by Swift-BAT in the first\nthree years of the survey. The fraction of Compton-thick AGN represents only\n4.6% of the total AGN population detected by Swift-BAT. However, we show that\nonce corrected for the bias against the detection of very absorbed sources the\nreal intrinsic fraction of Compton-thick AGN is 20$^{+9}_{-6}$%.

Measuring these populations is difficult, but important for\nunderstanding the assembly of the most massive galaxies. The Coma cluster is\none of the nearest truly massive galaxy clusters, and is host to a\ncorrespondingly large system of globular clusters (GCs). We use imaging from\nthe HST/ACS Coma Cluster Survey to present the first definitive detection of a\nlarge population of intracluster GCs (IGCs) that fills the Coma cluster core\nand is not associated with individual galaxies. The GC surface density profile\naround the central massive elliptical galaxy, NGC 4874, is dominated at large\nradii by a population of IGCs that extend to the limit of our data (R<520 kpc).\nWe estimate that there are 47000+/-1600 (random) +4000/-5000 (systematic) IGCs\nout to this radius, and that they make up ~70% of the central GC system, making\nthis the largest GC system in the nearby Universe. Even including the GC\nsystems of other cluster galaxies, IGCs still make up ~30-45% of the GCs in the\ncluster core. Observational limits from previous studies of the intracluster\nlight (ICL) suggest that the IGC population has a high specific frequency. If\nthe IGC population has a specific frequency similar to high-S_N dwarf galaxies,\nthen the ICL has a total stellar mass of ~10^12 M_sun within the cluster core.\nThe ICL makes up approximately half of the stellar luminosity and one-third of\nthe stellar mass of the central (NGC4874+ICL) system. The color distribution of\nthe IGC population is bimodal, with blue, metal-poor GCs outnumbering red,\nmetal-rich GCs by a ratio of 4:1.

However, in the inhomogeneous universe, even if\n<\\delta\\rho> =0, the distance relation is not the same as in the unperturbed\nuniverse. This can be of serious consequences as a change of distance affects\nthe mapping of CMB temperature fluctuations into the angular power spectrum. In\naddition, if the change of distance is relatively uniform no new temperature\nfluctuations are generated. It is therefore a different effect than the lensing\nor ISW effects which introduce additional CMB anisotropies. This paper shows\nthat the accuracy of the CMB analysis can be impaired by the accuracy of\ncalculation of the distance within the cosmological models. Since this effect\nhas not been fully explored before, to test how the inhomogeneities affect the\ndistance-redshift relation, several methods are examined: the Dyer-Roeder\nrelation, lensing approximation, and non-linear Swiss-Cheese model. In all\ncases, the distance to the last scattering surface is different than when\nhomogeneity is assumed.

After\ncorrecting the distance, the cosmological parameters change. Therefore, a not\nproperly estimated distance to the last scattering surface can be a major\nsource of systematics.

The present-day models of the\ndissipative phenomena occurring in the interiors of both the Earth and the Moon\nare not able to explain it. We examine several dynamical effects, not modeled\nin the data analysis, in the framework of long-range modified models of gravity\nand of the standard Newtonian/Einsteinian paradigm. It turns out that none of\nthem can accommodate de/dt_meas. Many of them do not even induce long-term\nchanges in e; other models do, instead, yield such an effect, but the resulting\nmagnitudes are in disagreement with de/dt_meas. In particular, the general\nrelativistic gravitomagnetic acceleration of the Moon due to the Earth's\nangular momentum has the right order of magnitude, but the resulting\nLense-Thirring secular effect for the eccentricity vanishes. A potentially\nviable Newtonian candidate would be a trans-Plutonian massive object (Planet\nX/Nemesis/Tyche) since it, actually, would affect e with a non-vanishing\nlong-term variation.

In this\ncontribution we elaborate on the formation of sunspots and particularly on the\nformation of penumbrae.

Since the CB radial\ncomponent varies across the stellar surface, the light blocked by the planet\nduring a transit will have a varying RV component, resulting in a small shift\nof the measured RVs.

Recent work has shown\nthat a planetesimal swarm embedded in a fully turbulent disc is subject to\nstrong excitation of the velocity dispersion, leading to collisional\ndestruction of bodies with radii R_p < 100 km. Significant diffusion of\nplanetesimal semimajor axes also arises, leading to large-scale spreading of\nthe planetesimal population throughout the inner regions of the protoplanetary\ndisc, in apparent contradiction of constraints provided by the distribution of\nasteroids within the asteroid belt. In this paper, we examine the dynamics of\nplanetesimals embedded in vertically stratified turbulent discs, with and\nwithout dead zones. Our main aims are to examine the turbulent excitation of\nthe velocity dispersion, and the radial diffusion, of planetesimals in these\ndiscs. We employ three dimensional MHD simulations [...], along with an\nequilibrium chemistry model [...] We find that planetesimals in fully turbulent\ndiscs develop large random velocities that will lead to collisional\ndestruction/erosion for bodies with sizes below 100 km, and undergo radial\ndiffusion on a scale \\sim 2.5 au over a 5 Myr disc life time.

However, each of the SFR calibrations relying on some\nform of dust emission overestimate the nuclear SFR by a factor of ~2. This is\nmore likely the result of excess dust heating through an accumulation of\nnon-ionizing stars associated with an extended episode of star formation in the\nnucleus rather than increased competition for ionizing photons by dust. SFR\ncalibrations using the non-thermal radio continuum yield values which only\nagree with the free-free SFRs for the nucleus, and underestimate the SFRs from\nthe extranuclear star-forming regions by a factor of ~2. This result likely\narises from the CR electrons decaying within the starburst region with\nnegligible escape compared to the young extranuclear star-forming regions.\nFinally, we find that the SFRs estimated using the total 33GHz emission agree\nwell with the free-free SFRs due to the large thermal fractions present at\nthese frequencies even when local diffuse backgrounds are not removed.

Two kinds of broad emission line region (BELR) models\nhave been proposed, outflow and gravitationally bound BELR, which are supported\nrespectively by blueshift of the CIV line and reverberation mapping\nobservations. To reconcile these two apparently different models, we present a\ndetailed comparison study between the CIV and MgII lines using a sample of AGNs\nselected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We find that the kinematics of the\nCIV region is different from that of MgII, which is thought to be controlled by\ngravity. A strong correlation is found between the blueshift and asymmetry of\nthe CIV profile and the Eddington ratio. This provides strong observational\nsupport for the postulation that the outflow is driven by radiation pressure.\nIn particular, we find robust evidence that the CIV line region is largely\ndominated by outflow at high Eddington ratios, while it is primarily\ngravitationally bounded at low Eddington ratios. Our results indicate that\nthese two emitting regions coexist in most of AGNs. The emission strength from\nthese two gases varies smoothly with Eddington ratio in opposite ways. This\nexplanation naturally reconciles the apparently contradictory views proposed in\nprevious studies. Finally, candidate models are discussed which can account for\nboth, the enhancement of outflow emission and suppression of normal BEL, in AGN\nwith high Eddington ratios. \n\n"}

All the previous studies on the core-accretion\nmodel assumed that the envelope has the solar composition uniformly. In fact,\nthe envelope is likely polluted by evaporated materials of icy planetesimals\nbecause icy planetesimals going through the envelope experience mass loss via\nstrong ablation and most of their masses are deposited in the deep envelope. In\nthis paper, we have demonstrated that envelope pollution in general lowers the\ncritical core masses and hastens gas accretion on to the protoplanet because of\nthe increase in the molecular weight and reduction of adiabatic temperature\ngradient. Widely- and highly-polluted envelopes allow smaller cores to form\nmassive envelopes before disc dissipation.

Dark matter is described by dust and dark energy with a scalar field\nwith potential V({\\phi}).

There are 5 primary reasons for suggesting this:\n1. there are well known disc surface mass density distributions that naturally\nproduce the observed rotation curves of galaxies. 2. there are a number of\nrotation curve `puzzles' that cannot be explained by a massive dark matter halo\ni.e. the success of maximum disc fitting, HI gas scaling to the observed\nrotation, the disc/halo conspiracy and the interpretation of the Tully-Fisher\nrelation. 3. recent 21cm observations show an almost constant HI surface\ndensity and a distinct `cut-off' or edge to galactic discs. We explain this\nconstant surface density in terms of either an optical depth effect or the\nonset of molecular gas formation and hence the possibility of considerably more\ngas existing in galaxies. We suggest that the HI cut-off does indeed mark the\nedge of the galactic disc. 4. there have been an increasing number of recent\nobservations that imply that X_CO may be ten times higher in the outer Galaxy.\nThis `dark' gas may provide adequate mass to account for galaxy rotation. 5. we\nshow that the additional baryonic mass required to account for the rotation of\ngalaxies is just that required to reconcile observed baryons with those\npredicted by big bang nucleosynthesis. Mestel discs can be used to straight\nforwardly explain the scaling laws of galaxies, particularly the observed\nrelation between rotation velocity and radius and the oft used Tully-Fisher\nrelation.

We present MHD simulations of cold front formation in the core\nof a galaxy cluster with anisotropic thermal conduction, exploring a parameter\nspace of conduction strengths parallel and perpendicular to the field lines.\nIncluding conduction has a strong effect on the temperature of the core and the\ncold fronts. Though magnetic field lines are draping parallel to the front\nsurfaces, the temperature jumps across the fronts are nevertheless reduced. The\nfield geometry is such that the cold gas below the front surfaces can be\nconnected to hotter regions outside via field lines along directions\nperpendicular to the plane of the sloshing motions and along sections of the\nfront which are not perfectly draped. This results in the heating of this gas\nbelow the front on a timescale of a Gyr, but the sharpness of the density and\ntemperature jumps may still be preserved. By modifying the density distribution\nbelow the front, conduction may indirectly aid in suppressing Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstabilities. If conduction along the field lines is unsuppressed, we find\nthat the characteristic sharp jumps in X-ray emission seen in observations of\nclusters do not form. This suggests that the presence of sharp cold fronts in\nhot clusters could be used to place upper limits on conduction in the {\\it\nbulk} of the ICM. Finally, the combination of sloshing and anisotropic thermal\nconduction can result in a larger flux of heat to the core than either process\nin isolation. While still not sufficient to prevent a cooling catastrophe in\nthe very central ($r \\sim$ 5 kpc) regions of the cool core, it reduces\nsignificantly the mass of cool gas that accumulates outside those radii. \n\n"}

This chemistry develops in the icy mantles when photodissociation\nreactions in the mantle release free hydrogen, which escapes the mantle via\ndiffusion. This results in serious alterations of the chemical composition of\nthe mantle because pores in the mantle provide surfaces for reactions in the\nnew, hydrogen-poor environment. Methods.

The planets invoked in that work were\nsignificantly more massive than Jupiter, and moved on orbits that were mutually\ncrossing - an architecture which suggests that mutual encounters and strong\ngravitational interactions are almost guaranteed. In this work, we perform a\nhighly detailed analysis of the proposed HW Vir planetary system. First, we\nconsider the dynamical stability of the system as proposed in the discovery\nwork. Through a mapping process involving 91,125 individual simulations, we\nfind that the system is so unstable that the planets proposed simply cannot\nexist, due to mean lifetimes of less than a thousand years across the whole\nparameter space. We then present a detailed re-analysis of the observational\ndata on HW Vir, deriving a new orbital solution that provides a very good fit\nto the observational data.

We present a model for the synthesis of the XRB\nthat uses as input a library of AGN X-ray spectra generated by the Monte Carlo\nsimulations described by Brightman & Nandra. This is essential to account for\nthe Compton scattering of X-ray photons in a dense medium and the impact of\nthat process on the spectra of obscured AGN. We identify a small number of\ninput parameters to the XRB synthesis code which encapsulate the minimum level\nof uncertainty in reconstructing the XRB spectrum. These are the power-law\nindex and high energy cutoff of the intrinsic X-ray spectra of AGN, the level\nof the reflection component in AGN spectra and the fraction of CT AGN in the\nUniverse. We then map the volume of the space allowed to these parameters by\ncurrent observations of the XRB spectrum in the range 3-100 keV. One of the\nleast constrained parameters is the fraction of CT AGN. Statistically\nacceptable fits to the XRB spectrum at the 68% confidence level can be obtained\nfor CT fractions in the range 5-50%. This is because of degeneracies among\ninput parameters to the XRB synthesis code and uncertainties in the modeling of\nAGN spectra (e.g. reflection). The most promising route for constraining the\nfraction of CT AGN in the Universe is via the direct detection of those sources\nin high energy (>10keV) surveys. It is shown that the observed fraction of CT\nsources identified in the SWIFT/BAT survey, limits the intrinsic fraction of CT\nAGN, at least at low redshift, to 10-20% (68% confidence level). We also make\npredictions on the number density of CT sources that current and future X-ray\nmissions are expected to discover.

If this\nscenario is correct, then short GRBs will be accompanied by the emission of\nstrong gravitational waves (GWs), detectable by GW observatories such as LIGO,\nVirgo, KAGRA, and LIGO-India. As compared with blind, all-sky, all-time GW\nsearches, externally triggered searches for GW counterparts to short GRBs have\nthe advantages of both significantly reduced detection threshold due to known\ntime and sky location and enhanced GW amplitude because of face-on orientation.\nBased on the distribution of signal-to-noise ratios in candidate compact binary\ncoalescence events in the most recent joint LIGO-Virgo data, our analytic\nestimates, and our Monte Carlo simulations, we find an effective sensitive\nvolume for GRB-triggered searches that is about 2 times greater than for an\nall-sky, all-time search.

Intermediate and\nminor mergers can thus be considered as plausible mechanisms for the evolution\nof S0's attending to their photometric scaling relations, as they can preserve\nand even strengthen any pre-existing structural bulge-disk coupling, triggering\nsignificant internal secular evolution (even in the absence of bars or\ndissipational effects).

Comparing the numbers of\nthese systems and interaction rates in different clusters drives our\nunderstanding of how cluster parameters affect the production of close\nbinaries.

Planet migration into the star is likely a\ncomplementary explanation to the view that systems with higher initial iron\nabundance form more planets, and that more crowded planets are more likely to\nscatter into eccentric orbits. Planets of iron-rich single stars have\neccentricity distributions that are higher than planets of iron-poor single\nstars (where \"rich\" and \"poor\" are stars whose [Fe/H] is above and below solar,\nrespectively). Stars with planets that have a stellar companion comprise a\nthird population of systems in which the stars are preferentially iron-rich. We\ndescribe new patterns that are best explained by eccentric planet migration\nbeing associated with other planets migrating into the star. Though medium\nplanets are more numerous than giant planets at periods greater than three\ndays, giant planets are more numerous than medium planets at the shortest\nperiods. Since giant planets migrate into the star faster, we show this as\nevidence of giant planet migration.

The overlap of a transiting planet and a stellar spot, for\ninstance, can produce anomalies in the transit light curves that may lead to\ninaccurate estimation of the transit duration, depth and timing. For instance\nsuch inaccuracies can affect the precise derivation of the planet's radius. In\nthis paper, we present the results of a quantitative study on the effects of\nstellar spots on high precision transit light curves. We show that spot\nanomalies can lead to the estimate of a planet radius that is 4% smaller than\nthe real value. The effects on the transit duration can also be of the order of\n4%, longer or shorter. Depending on the size and distribution of spots,\nanomalies can also produce transit timing variations with significant\namplitudes. For instance, TTVs with signal amplitudes of 200 seconds can be\nproduced when the spot is completely dark and as large as the largest Sun spot.\nOur study also indicates that the minimum size of a stellar spot with\ndetectable affects on the high precision transit light curve is around 0.03\ntime the stellar radius for typical Kepler telescope precision.

In\nthe context of the former, we confirm that the latest Swift sample of GRBs\nreveals an increasing evolution in the GRB rate relative to the star formation\nrate (SFR) at high redshifts. The observed discrepancy between the GRB rate and\nthe SFR may be eliminated by assuming a modest evolution parameterized as\n$(1+z)^{0.8}$---perhaps indicating a cosmic evolution in metallicity.

The\nmodel predicts the gas surface mass density and star formation intensity of a\ngalaxy given its rotation curve, stellar surface mass density and the gas\nvelocity dispersion. This model is tested on radial profiles of neutral and\nmolecular ISM surface mass density and star formation intensity of 12 galaxies\nselected from the THINGS sample.

To\noptimise the model, we evaluate four recipes for the stability parameter, three\nrecipes for apportioning the ISM into molecular and neutral components, and\neight versions of the SFL. We find no clear-cut best prescription for the\ntwo-fluid (gas and stars) stability parameter Q_2f and therefore for\nsimplicity, we use the Wang&Silk(1994) approximation (Q_WS).

We\nnumerically investigate the evolution of the gas as it assembles in a\nPopulation III stellar disk. We find that when DMA effects are neglected, the\ndisk undergoes multiple fragmentation events beginning at ~ 500 yr after the\nappearance of the first protostar. On the other hand, DMA heating and\nionization of the gas speeds the initial collapse of gas to protostellar\ndensities and also affects the stability of the developing disk against\nfragmentation, depending on the DM distribution. We compare the evolution when\nwe model the DM density with an analytical DM profile which remains centrally\npeaked, and when we simulate the DM profile using N-body particles (the 'live'\nDM halo). When utilizing the analytical DM profile, DMA suppresses disk\nfragmentation for ~ 3500 yr after the first protostar forms, in agreement with\nearlier work. However, when using a 'live' DM halo, the central DM density peak\nis gradually flattened due to the mutual interaction between the DM and the\nrotating gaseous disk, reducing the effects of DMA on the gas, and enabling\nsecondary protostars of mass ~ 1 M_sol to be formed within ~ 900 yr. These\nsimulations demonstrate that DMA is ineffective in suppressing gas collapse and\nsubsequent fragmentation, rendering the formation of long-lived dark stars\nunlikely.

Companion masses are found mostly in 0.1-1 Msun mass range with peak\nat 0.6 Msun. The formation of these systems is believed to involve a common\nenvelope phase, initiated by a BH progenitor, expected to be a massive star >20\nMsun. It was realized that it may be very problematic for a low-mass companion\nto eject a massive envelope of the black hole progenitor. It invoked\nsuggestions that an intermediate-mass companion ejects the envelope, and then\nis shredded by the Roche-lobe overflow to its current low-mass. But this\ncreates another issue; a temperature mismatch between hot models and the\nobserved cool low-mass donors. Finally, the main driver of Roche-lobe overflow\nthat is believed to be magnetic braking does not seem to follow any\ntheoretically calculated models.

In particular, for a flux ordering $F_{\\nu_e} > F_{\\bar\\nu_e} >\nF_{\\nu_x}$, as expected during the SN accretion phase, this instability occurs\nin the normal neutrino mass hierarchy. However, during this phase the ordinary\nmatter density can be larger than the neutrino one, suppressing the\nself-induced conversions.

OCs span a sizeable range in metallicity\n-0.6<[Fe/H]<+0.4), and they show abundances of light elements similar to disk\nstars of the same age. A different pattern is observed for heavy elements.

In this case, tests of the Kerr metric are only possible in combination\nwith other measurements.

Typically, one dex decrease in metallicity causes 0.20 and 0.02 mag\ndecrease in colors u-g and g-r, and 0.02 and 0.02 mag increase in colors r-i\nand i-z, respectively. The variations are larger for metal-rich stars than for\nmetal-poor ones, and for F/G/K stars than for A/M ones.

This splashback\nradius, $R_{sp}$, manifests itself as a sharp density drop in the halo\noutskirts, at a location that depends upon the mass accretion rate. We present\ncalibrations of $R_{sp}$ and the enclosed mass, $M_{sp}$, as a function of the\naccretion rate and alternatively peak height. We find that $R_{sp}$ varies\nbetween $\\approx0.8-1R_{200m}$ for rapidly accreting halos and\n$\\approx1.5R_{200m}$ for slowly accreting halos. The extent of a halo and its\nassociated environmental effects can thus extend well beyond the conventionally\ndefined \"virial\" radius.

The progenitors are\nselected using abundance matching techniques to account for the mass growth.\nThe morphologies strongly evolve from z~3.

At z~2-3 there is\na majority of irregular systems (~60-70%) with still 30% of spheroids.\n  We then analyze the SFRs, gas fractions and structural properties for the\ndifferent morphologies independently. Our results suggest two distinct channels\nfor the growth of bulges in massive galaxies.\n  Around 30-40% were already bulges at z~2.5, with low average SFRs and\ngas-fractions (10-15%), high Sersic indices (n>3-4) and small effective radii\n($R_e$~1 kpc) pointing towards an early formation through gas-rich mergers or\nVDI. Between z~ 2.5 and z~0, they rapidly increase their size by a factor of\n~4-5, become all passive but their global morphology remains unaltered. The\nstructural evolution is independent of the gas fractions, suggesting that it is\ndriven by ex-situ events.\n  The remaining 60% experience a gradual morphological transformation, from\nclumpy disks to more regular bulge+disks systems, essentially happening at z>1.\nIt results in the growth of a significant bulge component (n~3) for 2/3 of the\nsystems possibly through the migration of clumps while the remaining 1/3 keeps\na rather small bulge (n~1.5-2). The transition phase between disturbed and\nrelaxed systems and the emergence of the bulge is correlated with a decrease of\nthe star formation activity and the gas fractions.

We then take into\naccount two possible $f(R)$ models which could give rise to (dark) radiation.\nConstraints on the models are found by using the Planck Collaboration 2015 data\nwithin a cosmographic approach and by obtaining the matter power spectrum of\nthose models. The conclusion is that $f(R)$ gravity can only contribute\nminimally to the (dark) radiation to avoid departures from the observed matter\npower spectrum at the smallest scales (of the order of $0.01$Mpc$^{-1}$), i.e.,\nprecisely those scales that exited the horizon at the radiation dominated\nepoch.

In some modified gravity models, such\nas $f(R)$ gravity, gas temperature in a massive cluster is determined by the\neffective mass of that cluster, which can be larger than its true mass.

While recent Herschel\nobservations have shown that the peak of the prestellar CMF is close to the\nthermal Jeans mass in marginally supercritical filaments, the origin of the\npower-law tail of the CMF/IMF at the high-mass end is less clear.

This\ntemperature anomaly is aligned with a huge large quasar group (HLQG), and for\nthis reason we call it HLQG anomaly.

At the heart of an AGN is\na relativistic accretion disk around a spinning supermassive black hole (SMBH)\nwith an X-ray emitting corona and, sometimes, a relativistic jet. On larger\nscales, the outer accretion disk and molecular torus act as the reservoirs of\ngas for the continuing AGN activity. And on all scales from the black hole\noutwards, powerful winds are seen that probably affect the evolution of the\nhost galaxy as well as regulate the feeding of the AGN itself. In this review\narticle, we discuss how X-ray spectroscopy can be used to study each of these\ncomponents. We highlight how recent measurements of the high-energy cutoff in\nthe X-ray continuum by NuSTAR are pushing us to conclude that X-ray coronae are\nradiatively-compact and have electron temperatures regulated by\nelectron-positron pair production.

Unexpectedly, this usually unobscured source\nappeared strongly absorbed in the soft X-rays during the entire campaign, and\nsignatures of new and strong outflows were present in the almost simultaneous\nUV HST/COS data. Here we carry out a comprehensive spectral analysis of all\navailable XMM-Newton observations of NGC 5548 (for a total of ~763 ks) in\ncombination with 3 simultaneous NuSTAR obs.

Our main findings are that, during the 2013 campaign, the\nfirst 3 of these components appear to be partially covered by a heavy and\nvariable obscurer located along the l.o.s. that is consistent with a multilayer\nof cold and mildly ionized gas. We characterize in detail the short timescale\n(~ks-to-days) spectral variability of this new obscurer, and find it is mostly\ndue to a combination of Nh and Cf variations, on top of intrinsic power-law\nvariations. In addition, our best-fit spectrum is left with several (but\nmarginal) absorption features at rest-frame energies ~6.7-6.9 keV and ~8 keV,\nas well as a weak broad emission line feature redwards of the 6.4 keV emission\nline. These could indicate a more complex underlying model, e.g. a P-Cygni-type\nprofile if allowing for a large velocity and wide-angle outflow. These findings\nare consistent with a picture where the obscurer represents the manifestation\nalong the l.o.s. of a multilayer of gas that is likely outflowing at high\nspeed, and simultaneously producing heavy obscuration and scattering in the\nX-rays and broad absorption features in the UV. \n\n"}

Abstract: We report the discovery of two Li-rich giants, with A(Li) ~ 1.50, in an\nanalysis of a sample of 40 giants of the open cluster Trumpler 20 (with turnoff\nmass ~ 1.8 Msun). The cluster was observed in the context of the Gaia-ESO\nSurvey. The atmospheric parameters and Li abundances were derived using\nhigh-resolution UVES spectra. The Li abundances were corrected for nonlocal\nthermodynamical equilibrium (non-LTE) effects. Only upper limits of the Li\nabundance could be determined for the majority of the sample. Two giants with\ndetected Li turned out to be Li rich: star MG 340 has A(Li) non-LTE = 1.54 \\pm\n0.21 dex and star MG 591 has A(Li) non-LTE = 1.60 \\pm 0.21 dex. Star MG 340 is\non average ~ 0.30 dex more rich in Li than stars of similar temperature, while\nfor star MG 591 this difference is on average ~ 0.80 dex. Carbon and nitrogen\nabundances indicate that all stars in the sample have completed the first\ndredge-up.

Detailed simulation of massive star\nformation therefore requires an accurate treatment of radiation. However, all\npublished simulations have either used a diffusion approximation of limited\nvalidity; have only been able to simulate a single star fixed in space, thereby\nsuppressing potentially-important instabilities; or did not provide adequate\nresolution at locations where instabilities may develop. To remedy this we have\ndeveloped a new, highly accurate radiation algorithm that properly treats the\nabsorption of the direct radiation field from stars and the re-emission and\nprocessing by interstellar dust. We use our new tool to perform\nthree-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of the collapse of massive\npre-stellar cores with laminar and turbulent initial conditions and properly\nresolve regions where we expect instabilities to grow. We find that mass is\nchanneled to the stellar system via gravitational and Rayleigh-Taylor (RT)\ninstabilities, in agreement with previous results using stars capable of\nmoving, but in disagreement with methods where the star is held fixed or with\nsimulations that do not adequately resolve the development of RT instabilities.\nFor laminar initial conditions, proper treatment of the direct radiation field\nproduces later onset of instability, but does not suppress it entirely provided\nthe edges of radiation-dominated bubbles are adequately resolved. Instabilities\narise immediately for turbulent pre-stellar cores because the initial\nturbulence seeds the instabilities.

In this paper we present such a theory,\nbased on our recently-developed semi-analytic framework called MISFIT, which\nmodels gravito-turbulent fragmentation, including the suppression of\nfragmentation by protostellar radiation feedback. We compare the results\nincluding feedback to a control model in which it is omitted. We show that both\nclasses of models robustly reproduce the stellar correlation function at >0.01\npc scales, which is well approximated by a power-law that follows generally\nfrom scale-free physics (turbulence plus gravity) on large scales. On smaller\nscales protostellar disk fragmentation becomes dominant over common core\nfragmentation, leading to a steepening of the correlation function.\nMultiplicity is more sensitive to feedback: we found that a model with the\nprotostellar heating reproduces the observed multiplicity fractions and mass\nratio distributions for both Solar and sub-Solar mass stars (in particular the\nbrown dwarf desert), while a model without feedback fails to do so. The model\nwith feedback also produces an at-formation period distribution consistent with\nthe one inferred from observations.

These three observational features provide unique\ninformation on the physics of core collapse and supernovae explosions within\ninteracting binary systems. There is suggestive evidence for a gap between ~2-5\nMsun in the observed mass distribution.

The pericenters of the orbits\nperform a random walk, and we consider cases where this random walk slowly\nbrings the binary to the Hills tidal separation radius (the so-called empty\nloss-cone regime). However, we find that in a majority of cases the expected\nseparation does not occur and instead the members of the binary merge together.\nThis happens because the binary's eccentricity is excited by tidal interactions\nwith the MBH, and the relative excursions of the internal eccentricity of the\nbinary far exceed those in its internal semimajor axis. This frequently reduces\nthe pericenter separation to values below typical stellar diameters, which\ninduces a significant fraction of such binaries to merge ($\\gtrsim 75\\%$ in our\nset of numerical experiments).

We estimate the magnetic energy available in the interaction using\nanalytical models to provide an upper bound to the expected flare energy. We\ninvestigate three different mechanisms leading to magnetic energy release. The\nfirst two can release an energy up to $(0.2-1.2) B^{2}_{0} R^{3}/\\mu$, where\n$B_{0}$ is the surface field of the star, $R$ its radius, and $\\mu$ the\nmagnetic permeability of the plasma. They operate in young active stars whose\ncoronae have closed magnetic field lines up to the distance of their close-by\nplanets that can trigger the energy release. The third mechanism operates in\nweakly or moderately active stars having a coronal field with predominantly\nopen field lines at the distance of their planets.

In the last case, the non-conservation of the lepton current\nis derived through the kinetic approach without a computation of corresponding\nFeynman diagrams. Then the new kinetic equation is applied for the calculation\nof the neutrino asymmetry accounting for the Berry curvature and the\nelectroweak interaction with background fermions in the Higgs phase. Such an\ninteraction generates a neutrino asymmetry through the electroweak coupling of\nneutrino currents with electromagnetic fields in plasma, which is $\\sim\nG_\\mathrm{F}^2$. It turns out that this effect is especially efficient for\nmaximally helical magnetic fields. \n\n"}

Abstract: Cygnus X-3 is a unique microquasar in the Galaxy hosting a Wolf-Rayet\ncompanion orbiting a compact object that most likely is a low-mass black hole.\nThe unique source properties are likely due to the interaction of the compact\nobject with the heavy stellar wind of the companion. In this paper, we\nconcentrate on a very specific period of time prior to the massive outbursts\nobserved from the source. During this period, Cygnus X-3 is in a so-called\nhypersoft state, where the radio and hard X-ray fluxes are found to be at their\nlowest values (or non-detected), the soft X-ray flux is at its highest values,\nand sporadic gamma-ray emission is observed. We will utilize multiwavelength\nobservations in order to study the nature of the hypersoft state. We observed\nCygnus X-3 during the hypersoft state with Swift and NuSTAR in the X-rays and\nSMA, AMI-LA, and RATAN-600 in the radio. We also considered X-ray monitoring\ndata from MAXI and $\\gamma$-ray monitoring data from AGILE and Fermi. We found\nthat the spectra and timing properties of the multiwavelength observations can\nbe explained by a scenario where the jet production is turned off or highly\ndiminished in the hypersoft state and the missing jet pressure allows the wind\nto refill the region close to the black hole. The results provide proof of\nactual jet quenching in soft states of X-ray binaries. \n\n"}

Whether the RFSNe arise from\nlow-mass thermonuclear eruptions on white dwarfs or from the core collapse of\nmassive stars is still a matter of dispute.

By means of high-resolution two-dimensional hydrodynamical\nsimulations, we study the three feedback effects (the stellar wind heating, SNe\nfeedback, and AGN feedback) in suppressing star formation activities on the\nevolution of early-type galaxies with different stellar masses. AGN feedback\nmodels are updated based on \\citet{Yuan2018}. The gas sources comes exclusively\nfrom the mass losses of dying low-mass stars for most of our models. We find\nthat SNe feedback can keep star formation at a significantly low level for low\nmass elliptical galaxies for a cosmological evolution time. For the high mass\ngalaxies, AGN feedback can efficiently offset the radiative cooling and thus\nregulate the star formation activities. Such a suppression of star formation is\nextremely efficient in the inner region of the galaxies. AGB heating cannot\naccount for this suppression for low and high mass galaxies.

We investigate the\nkinematics in the outer halo of M49, look for substructures, and describe the\ntransition to the surrounding intra-group light. As kinematic tracers we use\nplanetary nebulae (PNe), combining kinematics from the extended Planetary\nNebula Spectrograph (PN.S) early-type galaxy survey with our recent deep\nphotometric sample. We study the position-velocity-plane for bright and faint\nPN populations out to 95 kpc radius, and employ a multi-Gaussian model for the\nvelocity distribution to identify stellar populations with distinct kinematics\nand histories. We report the detection of stellar-kinematic substructure\nassociated with the interaction of M49 with the dwarf irregular galaxy VCC\n1249. We find two kinematically distinct PN populations associated with the\nmain M49 halo and the extended intra-group light (IGL). These have velocity\ndispersions $\\sigma_{halo}\\simeq 170$ km/s and $\\sigma_{IGL} \\simeq400$ km/s at\n10-80 kpc radii.

Active galactic nucleus\n(AGN) disks are a promising location for the formation of these sBHBs, as well\nas binaries of other compact objects, because of powerful torques exerted by\nthe gas disk. These gas torques cause orbiting compact objects to migrate\ntowards regions in the disk where inward and outward torques cancel, known as\nmigration traps.

Using data from the GMRT we show\nthat post-correlation beamformation results in a many-folds increase in the\nsignal-to-noise for periodic signals from pulsars and several order of\nmagnitude reduction in the number of false triggers from single pulse events\nlike fast radio bursts (FRBs). This difference arises primarily because the\npost-correlation beam contains less red-noise, as well as less radio frequency\ninterference. The post-correlation beam can also be more easily calibrated than\nthe incoherent or phased array beams. We also discuss two different modes of\npost-correlation beamformation, viz.

Aims. The relative orientation has been\ninvestigated using different methods. Our goal is to explicitly compare two of\nthem: the Rolling Hough Transform (RHT) and the gradient technique. Methods. We\nhave applied the RHT method and the gradient technique to two regions,\nidentified in surface brightness maps at 353 GHz generated via MHD simulations\npost-processed using radiative transfer modelling. For both methods we have\nderived the relative orientation between the magnetic field and the density\nstructures, to which we have applied two different statistics, the histogram of\nrelative orientation (HRO) statistic and the projected Rayleigh statistic\n(PRS). Results. The samples of pixels selected by each method are substantially\ndifferent. When the methods are applied to the same pixel selection, the\nresults in terms of relative orientation as a function of column density are\nconsistent between each other. When each method is applied to its own pixel\nselection, the differences are apparent.

Those at\nhighest frequencies show up in pairs and are named twin peak high frequency\nQPOs (HF QPOs). Their central frequencies are typical of the orbital motion\ntimescale close to the compact object. HF QPOs are believed to carry unique\ninformation on the matter moving in the extreme gravitational field around the\ncompact object. In previous works we highlighted the work done by strong tides\non clumps of plasma orbiting in the accretion disk as suitable mechanism to\nproduce the HF QPOs.

Here we focus on the tidal deformation of a magnetized\nclump of plasma once tides load energy on it. The likely evolution of the shape\nof the clump after tidal circularization of the orbit and its subsequent\norbital evolution are investigated.

We aim to test whether the dust distribution exhibits\npeculiar features arising from the interplay among the gravitational\nperturbations of the planets in resonance, the evolution of the gas, and its\ninfluence on the dust grains' dynamics. We focus on the 3:2 and 2:1 resonance,\nwhere the trapping may be caused by the convergent migration of a Jupiter- and\nSaturn-mass planet, preceding the common gap formation and ensuing outward (or\ninward) migration. Models show that a common gap also forms in the dust\ncomponent -- similarly to what a single, more massive planet would generate --\nand that outward migration leads to a progressive widening of the dust gap and\nto a decoupling from the gas gap. As the system evolves, a significantly wider\ngap is observed in the dust distribution, which ceases to overlap with the gas\ngap in the inner disk regions. At the outer edge of the gas gap, outward\nmigration of the planets produces an over-density of dust particles, which\nevolve differently in the 3:2 and 2:1 resonances. For the 3:2, the dust trap at\nthe gap's outer edge is partly efficient and a significant fraction of the\ngrains filters through the gap. For the 2:1 resonance, the trap is more\nefficient and very few grains cross the gap, while the vast majority accumulate\nat the outer edge of the gap. \n\n"}

This region, M82 ``B,'' has been suspected to be a fossil\nstarburst site in which an intense episode of star formation occurred over 100\nMyr ago, and our new observations confirm this intepretation.

In agreement with\nprevious studies, we find that the UV and H alpha SFRs are qualitatively\nconsistent, even before corrections for extinction are applied. The uncorrected\nUV SFRs are systematically lower by a factor of 1.5 (with a factor of two\nscatter) among luminous galaxies with SFRs over 1 solar mass per year,\nindicating a higher effective attenuation of the far-UV radiation. Among less\nluminous galaxies there is no significant offset between the H alpha and far-UV\nSFR scales. Far-infrared and thermal radio continuum data available for a\nsubset of our sample allow us to estimate the attenuation in the UV and at H\nalpha independently. The UV and H alpha attenuations appear to be correlated,\nand confirm systematically higher attenuations in the UV. Although the galaxies\nin our sample show modest levels of attenuation (with median values of 0.9 mag\nat H alpha and 1.4 mag at 1550 Angstroms), the range across the sample is\nlarge, around 4 mag for H alpha and around 5 mag in the far-UV (1550\nAngstroms).

Abstract: VLT spectra of 14 luminous compact galaxies (LCGs) reveal strong metallic\nabsorption line sytems as well as narrow and intense emission lines. Their gas\nextinction is found to be large (Av ~ 1.5 mag) leading to an upward revision of\ntheir star formation rate (SFR) to an average value of ~ 40 Mo/yr. Large\nextinction values are also supported by the large rate of detection in one\nfield observed by ISO. Gas metal abundances in LCGs have about half the solar\nvalue. We argue that LCGs are the progenitors of present-day spiral bulges.\nLCGs have masses and light concentrations similar to those of present-day\nbulges. As in present-day galactic bulges, LCG stars show a wide range of\nabundances. Thus, observing LCGs allows us to directly witness an important\nstage in the formation of a massive galaxy, the building of the bulge prior to\nthat of the disk. The gas needed to feed the observed star formation is likely\nto be falling in from the outskirts of the galaxy, being tidally pulled out\nfrom interacting companion galaxies. Some LCGs also show evidence for the\nbeginning of a disk formation. If the above scenario holds for most LCGs, we\nestimate that at least 20% of present-day spiral galaxies have formed the bulk\nof their stars at relatively recent epochs, during the last 8-9 Gyr, at\nredshifts less than ~ 1. Since they are heavily extincted, we predict their IR\nluminosities to be relatively large, around Lir = 10^11 Lsun, i.e. near or\nslightly below the luminosities of the galaxies detected by ISO in the same\nredshift range. Taking into account the integrated IR luminosity of the LCG\ngalaxy population can lead to a significant upward revision of the cosmic SFR\ndensity in the redshift range from 0.5 to 1. \n\n"}

In\na separate sample of 40 galaxies biased for the detection of dust by virtue of\ntheir detection in the IRAS 100 micron band, dust is found in ~78% of the\ngalaxies, 15 of which contain dusty disks.

A\nmajority of IRAS and radio detections are also associated with dusty galaxies\nrather than dustless galaxies. This indicates that thermal emission from\nclumpy, filamentary dust is the main source of the far-IR radiation in early\ntype galaxies. Dust in small disk-like morphology tends to be well aligned with\nthe major axis of the host galaxies, while filamentary dust appears to be more\nrandomly distributed with no preference for alignment with any major galactic\nstructure.

Superwinds\nare complex multiphase outflows of cool, warm, and hot gas, dust, and\nmagnetized relativistic plasma. The observational manifestations of superwinds\nresult from the hydrodynamical interaction between the primary energy-carrying\nwind fluid and the ambient interstellar medium. Superwinds are ubiquitous in\ngalaxies in which the global star-formation rate per unit area exceeds roughly\n10$^{-1}$ M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$. This criterion is met by local\nstarbursts and the high-z Lyman Break galaxies. Several independent datasets\nand techniques imply that the total mass and energy outflow rates in a\nsuperwind are comparable to the starburst's star-formation-rate and mechanical\nenergy injection rate, respectively. Outflow speeds in interstellar matter\nentrained in the wind range from $\\sim 10^2$ to $10^3$ km/s, but the primary\nwind fluid itself may reach velocities as high as $\\sim$3000 km s$^{-1}$.

We fit the mass accretion histories by a universal function with\none parameter, the formation epoch a_c, defined when the log mass accretion\nrate dlogM/dloga falls below a critical value S. We find that late forming\ngalaxies tend to be less concentrated, such that c_vir ``observed'' at any\nepoch a_o is strongly correlated with a_c via c_vir=c_1*a_o/a_c. Scatter about\nthis relation is mostly due to measurement errors in c_v and a_c, implying that\nthe actual spread in c_vir for halos of a given mass can be mostly attributed\nto scatter in a_c. We demonstrate that this relation can also be used to\npredict the mass and redshift dependence of c_v, and the scatter about the\nmedian c_vir(M,z), using accretion histories derived from the Extended\nPress-Schechter (EPS) formalism, after adjusting for a constant offset between\nthe formation times as predicted by EPS and as measured in the simulations;this\nnew ingredient can thus be easily incorporated into semi-analytic models of\ngalaxy formation.

The most\nprominent feature is a \"tongue\" of emission which extends from the central cD\ngalaxy to the northwest and partly overlaps the radio relic. One possibility is\nthat this tongue is produced by Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instabilities through the\ninteraction between the cold gas around the cD galaxy and hot intracluster\nmedium. We estimate the critical velocity and time scale for the KH instability\nto be effective for the cold core around the cD galaxy. We find that the KH\ninstability can disrupt the cold core if the relative velocity is >~400 km\ns^-1. We compare the results with those of clusters in which sharp, undisrupted\ncold fronts have been observed; in these clusters, the low temperature gas in\ntheir central regions has a more regular distribution. In contrast to Abell\n133, these cluster cores have longer timescales for the disruption of the core\nby the KH instability when they are normalized to the timescale of the cD\ngalaxy motion. Thus, the other cores are less vulnerable to KH instability.\nAnother possible origin of the tongue is that it is gas which has been uplifted\nby a buoyant bubble of nonthermal plasma that we identify with the observed\nradio relic. From the position of the bubble and the radio estimate of the age\nof the relic source, we estimate avelocity of ~700 km s^-1 for the bubble.

Abstract: Models of dark energy are conveniently characterized by the equation-of-state\nparameter w=p/\\rho, where \\rho is the energy density and p is the pressure.\nImposing the Dominant Energy Condition, which guarantees stability of the\ntheory, implies that w \\geq -1. Nevertheless, it is conceivable that a\nwell-defined model could (perhaps temporarily) have w<-1, and indeed such\nmodels have been proposed. We study the stability of dynamical models\nexhibiting w<-1 by virtue of a negative kinetic term. Although naively\nunstable, we explore the possibility that these models might be\nphenomenologically viable if thought of as effective field theories valid only\nup to a certain momentum cutoff. Under our most optimistic assumptions, we\nargue that the instability timescale can be greater than the age of the\nuniverse, but only if the cutoff is at or below 100 MeV. We conclude that it is\ndifficult, although not necessarily impossible, to construct viable models of\ndark energy with w<-1; observers should keep an open mind, but the burden is on\ntheorists to demonstrate that any proposed new models are not ruled out by\nrapid vacuum decay. \n\n"}

Our numerical hydrodynamics\nmodeling of ring galaxy formation however shows that the maximum radial\nexpansion velocity of gas in the first ring ($v_{gas}$) is invariably below the\npropagation velocity of the first gas ring itself ($v_{ring}$). Modeling of the\nCartwheel galaxy indicates that the outer ring is currently propagating at\n$v_{ring} \\approx$ 100 km/s, while the maximum radial expansion velocity of gas\nin the outer ring is currently $v_{gas} \\approx$ 65 km/s. Modeling of the\nradial B-V/V-K color gradients of the Cartwheel ring galaxy also indicates that\nthe outer ring is propagating at $v_{ring} \\ge $ 90 km/s. We show that a\ncombined effect of inclination, finite thickness, and warping of the\nCartwheel's disk might be responsible for the lack of angular difference in the\npeak positions found for the azimuthally averaged $H\\alpha$, K and B surface\nbrightness profiles of the Cartwheel's outer ring.

First, we study the counts from two\nsets of six 5 degree by ~80 degree strips in the two galactic caps. In the six\nsouthern strips a deficit of ~30% was found relative to a predicted homogeneous\ndistribution at K~11. These strips were also in good agreement with a model\nincorporating the radial density function of the southern 2dF Galaxy Redshift\nSurvey (2dFGRS), which shows a deep underdensity between ~90 and 180 h-1 mpc.\nThese results indicate a very large `local hole' in the Southern Galactic Cap\n(SGC) to >150 h-1 Mpc with a linear size across the sky of ~200 h-1 Mpc, but\nwith a significantly lower mean underdensity of ~30% than that suggested by the\nbright APM SGC counts. The counts in the northern set of strips are low overall\nbut indicate a more varied pattern. When all the available 2MASS data with\n|b|>30 were aggregated, they indicated underdensities of ~18% and ~30% at K~11\nfor the northern and southern areas respectively. Our second method uses the\nratio of the counts with 11.38<K<12.38 to 12.88<K<13.38 binned in 25 degree\nsquared areas; the counts from these areas provide a smoothed map over the sky\nof the slope in the counts between K=11.38 and 13.38.

Converting between the Ly-alpha forest\nobservations and the linear mass power spectrum requires a careful treatment of\nnuisance parameters and modeling with cosmological simulations.

However, from a practical point\nof view, the most suited observables are not, necessarily, those that provide\nmore orthogonality in that parameter space, but those that give the best\nbalance between parameter degeneracy and sensitivity to signal-to-noise ratio\nper Angstrom, SN_A. In order to achieve the minimum combined total error in the\nderived physical parameters, this work discusses how the functional dependence\nof typical line-strength indices and colors on SN_A allows to define a\nsuitability parameter which helps to obtain better realistic combinations of\nspectroscopic data. As an example, we discuss in more detail the problem of\nbreaking the well known age-metallicity degeneracy in relatively old stellar\npopulations, comparing the suitability of different spectroscopic diagrams for\na simple stellar population of solar metallicity and 12 Gyr old. \n\n"}

Two kHz QPOs are usually detected in each star.\nBurst oscillations and two kHz QPOs have recently been detected in the 401 Hz\naccretion-powered X-ray pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658. In this star the frequency of\nthe burst oscillation is approximately equal to the star's spin frequency\nnu_spin whereas the frequency separation of the two kHz QPOs is approximately\nnu_spin/2. If as expected the frequency of the burst oscillations in other\nstars is also approximately nu_spin, the frequency separation is approximately\nnu_spin in some stars but approximately nu_spin/2 in others. A frequency\nseparation approximately equal to nu_spin/2 is unexplained in all existing\nmodels of the kHz QPOs. Here we propose a modified version of the sonic-point\nbeat-frequency model that can explain within a single framework why the\nfrequency separation is close to nu_spin in some stars but close to nu_spin/2\nin others. As in the original sonic-point model, the frequency nu_QPO2 of the\nupper kHz QPO is close to the orbital frequency nu_orb at the radius r_{sp} of\nthe sonic point in the disk flow. We show that magnetic and radiation fields\nrotating with the star will preferentially excite vertical motions in the disk\nat the \"spin-resonance'' radius r_{sr} where nu_orb - nu_spin is equal to the\nvertical epicyclic frequency, producing vertical motions in the disk that\nmodulate the X-ray flux at approximately nu_QPO2 - nu_spin or approximately\nnu_QPO2 - nu_spin/2, depending on whether the disk flow at r_{sr} is smooth or\nclumped. This sonic-point and spin-resonance model can also explain\nquantitatively the decrease of the kHz QPO frequency separation with increasing\naccretion rate that is observed in many sources. \n\n"}

In that sense, the photoevaporation for\nsubgalactic systems is not so perfect as argued by one-dimensional spherical\ncalculations. The final stellar fraction depends on the collapse epoch and the\nmass of system, but almost regardless of the reionization epoch.

The former includes a detailed description of the chemical evolution of\ngalaxies of different morphological types with no density evolution; the latter\nincludes the merging histories of the galactic DM haloes, as predicted by the\nhierarchical clustering scenario, but it does not contain morphological\nclassification nor chemical evolution. We find that at z< 1.5 both models are\nconsistent with the available data on the LD of galaxies in all the considered\nbands. At high z, the LDs predicted in the PLE model show a peak due to the\nformation of ellipticals, whereas the SAM predicts a gradual decrease of the\nstar formation and of the LD for z> 2.5. At such redshifts the PLE predictions\ntend to overestimate the present data in the B band whereas the SAM tends to\nunderestimate the observed UV LD.

Two disjoint sub-samples are constructed, using the\nmass ratio of the two most massive progenitors at z=0.5 m_2 / m_1 (m_1 < m_2),\nnamely a recent major merger sample and a steady accretion mode sample. The\nmass of clusters in the merger sample is on average ~43% larger than the mass\nof the two progenitors (m_1 + m_2), whereas in the steady accretion mode sample\na smaller increase of ~25% is found. The separation vector connecting the two\nmost massive progenitor halos at z=0.5 is strongly correlated with the\norientation of the cluster at z=0. The angular momentum of the clusters in the\nrecent major merger sample tends to be parallel to orbital angular momentum of\nthe two progenitors, whereas the angular momentum of the steady accretion mode\nsample is mainly determined by the angular momentum of the most massive\nprogenitor. The long range correlations for the major and the minor principal\naxes of cluster pairs extend to distances of ~100 Mpc/h. Weak angular momentum\ncorrelations are found for distances < 20 Mpc/h.

We confirm both the early\nconjecture from linear analysis and the later results based on preformed MHD\nbubbles; namely, that very modest ICM magnetic fields can stabilize the rising\nbubbles against disruption by Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstabilities. We find in addition that amplification of the ambient fields as\nthey stretch around the bubbles can be sufficient to protect the bubbles or\ntheir initial fragments even if the fields are initially much too weak to play\na significant role early in the evolution of the bubbles. Indeed, even with\ninitial fields less than a micro-Gauss and values of $\\beta = P_g/P_b$\napproaching $10^5$, magnetic stresses in our simulations eventually became\nlarge enough to influence the bubble evolution. Magnetic field influence also\ndepends significantly on the geometry of the ICM field and on the topology of\nthe field at the bubble/ICM interface. For example, reconnection of\nanti-parallel fields across the bubble top greatly reduced the ability of the\nmagnetic field to inhibit disruptive instabilities.

The X-ray spectra of highly obscured AGN invariably present a\nprominent soft excess emission above the extrapolation of the hard X-ray\ncomponent. This soft component can account for a very large fraction of the\noverall X-ray energy budget. As this component is generally unobscured - and\ntherefore likely produced in extended gas structures - it may lead to a severe\nunderestimation of the nuclear obscuration in z~1 absorbed AGN, if standard\nX-ray colors are used to classify them. As a by-product of our study, we report\nthe discovery of a soft X-ray, luminous (~7x10^{40} erg/s) halo embedding the\ninteracting galaxy pair Mkn266. \n\n"}

We\nfind that the luminosity function taken in isolation is somewhat limited in its\nability to constrain SMBH evolution due to some strong degeneracies.

If\nthese clusters both harbor an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH; 10^{2-4}\nMsun) in their center, they can become a strong source of gravitational waves\nwhen the black holes merge with each other. In order to understand the\ndynamical processes that operate in such a scenario, one has to study the\nevolution of the merger of two such young massive star clusters, and more\nspecifically, their respective IMBHs. We employ the direct-summation Nbody4\nnumerical tool on special-purpose GRAPE6 hardware to simulate a merger of two\nstellar clusters each containing 63,000 particles and a central IMBH. This\nallows us to study accurately the orbital evolution of the colliding clusters\nand the embedded massive black holes.

The large body of observational\nresults collected by soft (0.5-2 keV) and hard (2-10 keV) X-ray surveys are\nused to constrain at best the properties of the Compton-thin AGN population and\nits contribution to the XRB emission. The number ratio R between moderately\nobscured (Compton-thin) AGN and unobscured AGN is fixed by the comparison\nbetween the soft and hard XLFs, which suggests that R decreases from 4 at low\nluminosities to 1 at high luminosities. From the same comparison there is no\nclear evidence of an evolution of the obscured AGN fraction with redshift. The\ndistribution of the absorbing column densities in obscured AGN is determined by\nmatching the soft and hard source counts.

The redshift evolution\nof the mean photo-ionization rate and the median optical depth of the\nintergalactic medium (IGM) are derived statistically from the observed\ntransmitted flux and the pixel optical depth probability distribution function\nrespectively.

However, difficulties in calibrating the relation between the\ncluster observable and halo mass, and the lack of completeness information,\nmake this technique particularly susceptible to systematic errors. Here we\nargue that a cluster abundance analysis using statistical weak lensing on the\nstacked clusters leads to a robust lower limit on the amplitude of\nfluctuations. The method compares the average weak lensing signal measured\naround the whole cluster sample to a theoretical prediction, assuming that the\nclusters occupy the centers of all of the most massive halos above some minimum\nmass threshold. If the amplitude of fluctuations is below a certain limiting\nvalue, there are too few massive clusters in this model and the theoretical\nprediction falls below the observations. Since any effects that modify the\nmodel assumptions can only decrease the theoretical prediction, the limiting\namplitude becomes a robust lower limit.

This deviation is significantly\nlarger in the interarm region than in the spiral arm. The extinction curve in\nthe spiral arm resembles a Milky Way $R_V=5.0$ dust model and the interarm\nextinction curve is flatter (``greyer'') still.

While it appears that\nan accretion disk corona (ADC) model, where the corona sandwiches the cold\naccretion disk, is capable of explaining the observations of Seyfert galaxies,\nrecent work has shown that this model is problematic for GBHCs. To address the\ndifferences in the spectra of Seyferts and GBHCs, we consider the structure of\nthe atmosphere of the accretion disk in a region near an active magnetic flare\n(we refer to this region as transition layer). We show that the transition\nlayer is subject to a thermal instability.

The resonant energy\ntransfer between the orbit and NS speeds up or slows down the inspiral and\ninduces a phase change in the emitted gravitational waves from the binary. A\ntidal resonance, (jk,m), occurs when the mode frequency equals m times the\norbital frequency. For f-mode resonance to occur before coalescence, the NS\nmust have rapid rotation, with spin frequency nu_s>710Hz for (22,2)-resonance\nand nu_s>570Hz for (33,3)-resonance (M=1.4Mo and R=10km; however, for R=15km,\nthese spin frequencies become 330Hz and 250Hz). Because of strong tidal\ncoupling, f-mode resonances induce a large change in the number of orbital\ncycles, N_orb, with maximum N_orb~10-1000 for (22,2)-resonance and N_orb~1 for\n(33,3)- resonance. Such resonant effects, if present, must be included in\nconstructing waveform templates used in searching for gravitational wave\nsignals. Higher order f-mode resonances can occur at slower rotation rates, but\nN_orb<0.1. For the dominant g-mode (22,2)-resonance, even modest rotation\n(nu_s<100Hz) can enhance the resonant effect on the orbit by shifting resonance\nto a smaller orbital frequency. However, because of the weak coupling, N_orb\nlies in the range 10^-3-10^-2 (depending on the NS EOS) and is probably\nnegligible for the purpose of detecting gravitational waves. R-mode resonances\nrequire misaligned spin-orbit inclinations, and the dominant resonances\ncorrespond to (22,3) and (22,1). Since tidal coupling depends strongly on\nrotation rate, N_orb<10^-2(R/10km)^(10)(M/1.4Mo)^(-20/3) is negligible for\ncanonical NS parameters but can be appreciable if the NS radius is larger. \n\n"}

This\nbelief is not justified in general. It is put to rest here in the context of\nthe general framework for alpha variability [J. D. Bekenstein, Phys. Rev. D 25,\n1527 (1982)] in which the exponent of a scalar field plays the role of the\npermittivity and inverse permeability of the vacuum. The coupling of particles\nto the scalar field is necessarily such that the anomalous force acting on a\ncharged particle by virtue of its mass's dependence on the scalar field is\ncancelled by terms modifying the usual Coulomb force. As a consequence a\nparticle's acceleration in external fields depends only on its charge to mass\nratio, in accordance with the principle. And the center of mass acceleration of\na composite object can be proved to be independent of the object's internal\nconstitution, as the weak equivalence principle requires. Likewise the widely\nemployed assumption that the Coulomb energy of matter is the principal source\nof the scalar field proves wrong; Coulomb energy effectively cancels out in the\ncontinuum description of the scalar field's dynamics. This cancellation\nresolves a cosmological conundrum: with Coulomb energy as source of the scalar\nfield, the framework would predict a decrease of alpha with cosmological\nexpansion, whereas an increase is claimed to be observed. Because of the said\ncancellation, magnetic energy of cosmological baryonic matter is the main\nsource of the scalar field. Consequently the expansion is accompanied by an\nincrease in alpha; for reasonable values of the framework's sole parameter,\nthis occurs at a rate consistent with the observers' claims. \n\n"}

The topic touched upon include: early inflation that\noccurs while the size of the new dimensions are still small, the spectrum and\nmagnitude of density perturbations, the post-inflation era of contraction of\nour world while the internal dimensions evolve to their final ``large'' radius,\nand the production of gravitons in the bulk during these two eras.

{"id": "hep-ph/9903422", "contents": "Title: SN1987A Constraints on Large Compact Dimensions Abstract: Recently there has been a lot of interest in models in which gravity becomes\nstrong at the TeV scale. The observed weakness of gravitational interactions is\nthen explained by the existence of extra compact dimensions of space, which are\naccessible to gravity but not to Standard Model particles. In this letter we\nconsider graviton emission into these extra dimensions from a hot supernova\ncore. The phenomenology of SN1987A places strong constraints on this energy\nloss mechanism, allowing us to derive a bound on the fundamental Planck scale.\nFor the case of two extra dimensions we obtain a very strong bound of M > 50\nTeV, which corresponds to a radius R < 0.3 microns. While there are a lot of\nsources of uncertainty associated with this bound, we find that pushing it down\nto the few-TeV range, which could in principle be probed by ground-based\nexperiments, is disfavored. For three or more extra dimensions the SN1987A\nconstraints do not exclude a TeV gravitational scale. \n\n"}
{"id": "hep-ph/9912455", "contents": "Title: Invisible Axions and Large-Radius Compactifications Abstract: We study some of the novel effects that arise when the QCD axion is placed in\nthe ``bulk'' of large extra spacetime dimensions. First, we find that the mass\nof the axion can become independent of the energy scale associated with the\nbreaking of the Peccei-Quinn symmetry. This implies that the mass of the axion\ncan be adjusted independently of its couplings to ordinary matter, thereby\nproviding a new method of rendering the axion invisible. Second, we discuss the\nnew phenomenon of laboratory axion oscillations (analogous to neutrino\noscillations), and show that these oscillations cause laboratory axions to\n``decohere'' extremely rapidly as a result of Kaluza-Klein mixing. This\ndecoherence may also be a contributing factor to axion invisibility. Third, we\ndiscuss the role of Kaluza-Klein axions in axion-mediated processes and decays,\nand propose several experimental tests of the higher-dimensional nature of the\naxion. Finally, we show that under certain circumstances, the presence of an\ninfinite tower of Kaluza-Klein axion modes can significantly accelerate the\ndissipation of the energy associated with cosmological relic axion\noscillations, thereby enabling the Peccei-Quinn symmetry-breaking scale to\nexceed the usual four-dimensional relic oscillation bounds. Together, these\nideas therefore provide new ways of obtaining an ``invisible'' axion within the\ncontext of higher-dimensional theories with large-radius compactifications. \n\n"}

The quantum fluctuations of the inflaton is calculated and compared\nto those of the conventional 4-dimensional inflationary scenario. It is shown\nthat the deviation of the primordial spectrum of this model from that of the\nconventional one is too small to be observed even if $AdS$ radius is very\nlarge.

We find\nthat, in some models, the most probable values of the slope are very small,\nimplying that the dark energy density stays constant to very high accuracy\nthroughout cosmological evolution. In other models, however, the most probable\nvalues of the slope are such that the slow roll condition is only marginally\nsatisfied, leading to a re-collapse of the local universe on a time-scale\ncomparable to the lifetime of the sun. In the latter case, the effective\nequation of state varies appreciably with the redshift, leading to a number of\ntestable predictions. \n\n"}

It is demonstrated that effective phantom\n(or quintessence) phase of late universe may occur in the presence of such term\nwhen the scalar is phantom or for non-zero potential (for canonical scalar).\nHowever, with the increase of the curvature the GB term may become dominant so\nthat phantom phase is transient and $w=-1$ barrier may be passed. Hence, the\ncurrent acceleration of the universe may be caused by mixture of scalar phantom\nand (or) potential/stringy effects. It is remarkable that scalar-Gauss-Bonnet\ncoupling acts against the Big Rip occurence in phantom cosmology. \n\n"}
{"id": "hep-th/0505172", "contents": "Title: Cosmic D-strings as Axionic D-term Strings Abstract: In this work we derive non-singular BPS string solutions from an action that\ncaptures the essential features of a D-brane-anti-D-brane system compactified\nto four dimensions. The model we consider is a supersymmetric abelian Higgs\nmodel with a D-term potential coupled to an axion-dilaton multiplet. The\nstrings in question are axionic D-term strings which we identify with the\nD-strings of type II string theory. In this picture the Higgs field represents\nthe open string tachyon of the D-Dbar pair and the axion is dual to a Ramond\nRamond form. The crucial term allowing the existence of non-singular BPS\nstrings is the Fayet-Iliopoulos term, which is related to the tensions of the\nD-string and of the parent branes. Despite the presence of the axion, the\nstrings are BPS and carry finite energy, due to the fact that the space gets\nvery slowly decompactified away from the core, screening the long range axion\nfield (or equivalently the theory approaches an infinitely weak 4D coupling).\nWithin our 4D effective action we also identify another class of BPS string\nsolutions (s-strings) which have no ten dimensional analog, and can only exist\nafter compactification. \n\n"}

A new non-perturbative decay channel for moduli oscillations is\ndiscussed. This channel becomes effective when the oscillating field results in\na net negative mass term for the decay products.
