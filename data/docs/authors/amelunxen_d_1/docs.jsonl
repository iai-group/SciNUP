It is assumed that the channel states of each\nreceiver are randomly selected from $\\mathds{R}^{M\\times 1}$ (or from\n$\\mathds{C}^{M\\times 1}$). It is shown that no matter what $J_r$ is, the\ndegrees of freedom (DoF) of $\\frac{MK}{M+K-1}$ is achievable. The achievable\nscheme relies on the idea of interference alignment at receivers, without\nexploiting the possibility of cooperation among transmit antennas. It is proven\nthat if $J_r \\geq M$, $r=1,...,K$, this scheme achieves the optimal DoF. This\nresults implies that when the uncertainty of the base station about the channel\nrealization is considerable, the system loses the gain of cooperation. However,\nit still benefits from the gain of interference alignment. In fact, in this\ncase, the compound broadcast channel is treated as a compound X channel.\n  Moreover, it is shown that when the base station knows the channel states of\nsome of the receivers, a combination of transmit cooperation and interference\nalignment would achieve the optimal DoF.\n  Like time-invariant $K$-user interference channels, the naive vector-space\napproaches of interference management seem insufficient to achieve the optimal\nDoF of this channel. In this paper, we use the Number-Theory approach of\nalignment, recently developed by Motahari et al.[1].

While the\nbest previously-known general DoF outer bound is consistent with the spatial\ninvariance conjecture, the best previously-known general DoF inner bound,\ninspired by the K user MIMO interference channel, was based on the\ndecomposition of every transmitter and receiver into multiple single antenna\nnodes, transforming the network into an AM X AN user SISO X network. While such\na decomposition is DoF optimal for the K user MIMO interference channel, a gap\nremained between the best inner and outer bound for the MIMO X channel.

As a means of maintaining seamless end-user\nexperience in dynamic environments, as well as for ensuring network security,\nthis paper deals with a crucial network monitoring task termed dynamic\nanomalography. Given link traffic measurements (noisy superpositions of\nunobserved OD flows) periodically acquired by backbone routers, the goal is to\nconstruct an estimated map of anomalies in real time, and thus summarize the\nnetwork `health state' along both the flow and time dimensions. Leveraging the\nlow intrinsic-dimensionality of OD flows and the sparse nature of anomalies, a\nnovel online estimator is proposed based on an exponentially-weighted\nleast-squares criterion regularized with the sparsity-promoting $\\ell_1$-norm\nof the anomalies, and the nuclear norm of the nominal traffic matrix.

Given a finite horizon $[0,T]$ and a low-mode truncation of the\nPDE, a PM provides an approximate parameterization of the uncontrolled high\nmodes by the controlled low ones so that the unexplained high-mode energy is\nreduced, in an $L^2$-sense, when this parameterization is applied.

These formulas allow for an effective\nderivation of reduced ODE systems, aimed to model the evolution of the low-mode\ntruncation of the controlled state variable, where the high-mode part is\napproximated by the PM function applied to the low modes. A priori error\nestimates between the resulting PM-based low-dimensional suboptimal controller\n$u_R^\\ast$ and the optimal controller $u^*$ are derived.

We study the properties of K-minimal inequalities\nby establishing algebraic necessary conditions for an inequality to be\nK-minimal.

Here we develop a framework, based on algorithmic\ninformation theory, to quantify the extent to which information is preserved\nwhen network motif analysis, graph spectra and spectral sparsification methods\nare applied to over twenty different biological and artificial networks.

The third construction\nprovides longer MSR codes with three parities, which are not access-optimal,\nand do not necessarily attain the sub-packetization bound.\n  In addition to a minimum storage in a node, all three constructions allow the\nentire data to be recovered from a minimal number of storage nodes. That is,\ngiven storage $\\ell$ in each node, the entire stored data can be recovered from\nany $2\\log_2 \\ell$ for 2 parity nodes, and either $3\\log_3\\ell$ or\n$4\\log_3\\ell$ for 3 parity nodes.

When the marginal\nprobability measures are absolutely continuous (or vanish on small sets) the\ntheory of Wasserstein barycenters is well-developed (see the seminal paper\n[1]). However, exact continuous computation of Wasserstein barycenters in this\nsetting is tractable in only a small number of specialized cases. Moreover, in\nmany applications data is given as a set of probability measures with finite\nsupport. In this paper, we develop theoretical results for Wasserstein\nbarycenters in this discrete setting. Our results rely heavily on polyhedral\ntheory which is possible due to the discrete structure of the marginals.\n  Our results closely mirror those in the continuous case with a few\nexceptions. In this discrete setting we establish that Wasserstein barycenters\nmust also be discrete measures and there is always a barycenter which is\nprovably sparse. Moreover, for each Wasserstein barycenter there exists a\nnon-mass-splitting optimal transport to each of the discrete marginals. Such\nnon-mass-splitting transports do not generally exist between two discrete\nmeasures unless special mass balance conditions hold. This makes Wasserstein\nbarycenters in this discrete setting special in this regard.\n  We illustrate the results of our discrete barycenter theory with a\nproof-of-concept computation for a hypothetical transportation problem with\nmultiple marginals: distributing a fixed set of goods when the demand can take\non different distributional shapes characterized by the discrete marginal\ndistributions. A Wasserstein barycenter, in this case, represents an optimal\ndistribution of inventory facilities which minimize the squared\ndistance/transportation cost totaled over all demands. \n\n"}

To combine the advantages of\nRF and FSO backhauls, this paper proposes a cost-efficient backhaul network\nusing the hybrid RF/FSO technology. To ensure a resilient backhaul, the paper\nimposes a given degree of redundancy by connecting each node through $K$\nlink-disjoint paths so as to cope with potential link failures.

The merits of this approach are two folds. First, the core function\nis usually separable, which makes the subproblems at each step decomposable and\nparticularly attractive for parallel computing. Second, the choice of the core\nfunction is quite flexible. Consequently, by carefully specifying this\nfunction, APP-AL may reduce to some standard optimization algorithms. In this\npaper, we pursue enhancing such flexibility by allowing the core function to be\nnon-identical at each step of the algorithm, and name it varying auxiliary\nproblem principle (VAPP-AL).

The information cost of a\nprotocol is the amount of information the protocol reveals to Alice and Bob\nabout each others inputs, and the information complexity of a function is the\ninfimum of information costs over all valid protocols.

It is known that in the Gaussian noise\nsetting, the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) has an expected squared\n$\\ell_2$-estimation error that is on the same order as the Cram\\'er-Rao lower\nbound. Moreover, even though the MLE is an optimal solution to a non-convex\nquadratic optimization problem, it can be found with high probability using\nsemidefinite programming (SDP), provided that the noise power is not too large.\nIn this paper, we study the estimation and convergence performance of a\nrecently-proposed low-complexity alternative to the SDP-based approach, namely,\nthe generalized power method (GPM). Our contribution is twofold. First, we\nbound the rate at which the estimation error decreases in each iteration of the\nGPM and use this bound to show that all iterates---not just the MLE---achieve\nan estimation error that is on the same order as the Cram\\'er-Rao bound. Our\nresult holds under the least restrictive assumption on the noise power and\ngives the best provable bound on the estimation error known to date.

We instantiate these ideas in three\ndifferent setups: (i) when comparing a discrete distribution to another, we\nshow that incremental stochastic optimization schemes can beat Sinkhorn's\nalgorithm, the current state-of-the-art finite dimensional OT solver; (ii) when\ncomparing a discrete distribution to a continuous density, a semi-discrete\nreformulation of the dual program is amenable to averaged stochastic gradient\ndescent, leading to better performance than approximately solving the problem\nby discretization ; (iii) when dealing with two continuous densities, we\npropose a stochastic gradient descent over a reproducing kernel Hilbert space\n(RKHS). This is currently the only known method to solve this problem, apart\nfrom computing OT on finite samples.

This rationality assumption, known as\nregularity, is satisfied by almost all discrete choice models considered in the\nrevenue management and choice theory literature, and in particular by random\nutility models.

{"id": "1609.09594", "contents": "Title: The value of timing information in event-triggered control Abstract: We study event-triggered control for stabilization of unstable linear plants\nover rate-limited communication channels subject to unknown, bounded delay. On\none hand, the timing of event triggering carries implicit information about the\nstate of the plant. On the other hand, the delay in the communication channel\ncauses information loss, as it makes the state information available at the\ncontroller out of date. Combining these two effects, we show a phase transition\nbehavior in the transmission rate required for stabilization using a given\nevent-triggering strategy. For small values of the delay, the timing\ninformation carried by the triggering events is substantial, and the system can\nbe stabilized with any positive rate. When the delay exceeds a critical\nthreshold, the timing information alone is not enough to achieve stabilization\nand the required rate grows. When the loss of information due to the\ncommunication delay perfectly compensates the implicit information carried by\nthe triggering events, the delay equals the inverse of the entropy rate of the\nplant, and we obtain the same rate requirement prescribed by the data-rate\ntheorem. When the delay is larger than this threshold, the required rate\nbecomes larger than that required by the data-rate theorem.

The macrocell base station (BS) locations are modeled by an\nindependent PPP. This model is consistent with the user and SBS configurations\nconsidered by 3GPP. Using this model, we study the performance of a typical\nuser in terms of coverage probability and throughput for two association\npolicies: i) Policy 1, under which a typical user is served by the open-access\nBS that provides maximum averaged received power, and ii) Policy 2, under which\nthe typical user is served by the small cell tier if the maximum averaged\nreceived power from the open-access SBSs is greater than a certain power\nthreshold; and macro tier otherwise. A key intermediate step in our analysis is\nthe derivation of distance distributions from a typical user to the open-access\nand closed-access interfering SBSs. Our analysis demonstrates that as the\nnumber of SBSs reusing the same resource block increases, coverage probability\ndecreases whereas throughput increases.

We show that the rate can be accelerated to\n$O(1/t^2)$ if the objective is strongly convex.

In\nthis paper, we consider an information-theoretic cost function for performing\nconstrained stochastic searches that promote the formation of risk-averse to\nrisk-favoring behaviors. This cost function is the value of information, which\nprovides the optimal trade-off between the expected return of a policy and the\npolicy's complexity; policy complexity is measured by number of bits and\ncontrolled by a single hyperparameter on the cost function. As the policy\ncomplexity is reduced, the agents will increasingly eschew risky actions. This\nreduces the potential for high accrued rewards. As the policy complexity\nincreases, the agents will take actions, regardless of the risk, that can raise\nthe long-term rewards. The obtainable reward depends on a single, tunable\nhyperparameter that regulates the degree of policy complexity.\n  We evaluate the performance of value-of-information-based policies on a\nstochastic version of Ms. Pac-Man.

The action of each layer (i.e. a\nfactor) is obtained by applying a fixed linear operator to a vector of\nparameters satisfying a constraint. The number of layers is not limited.\nAssuming that $X$ is given and factors have been estimated, the error between\nthe product of the estimated factors and $X$ (i.e. the reconstruction error) is\neither the statistical or the empirical risk.

Yet, in the\ncase of box constraints on the native variables, defining suitable bounds on a\nlow dimensional domain appears to be complex. Indeed, a small search domain\ndoes not guarantee to find a solution even under restrictive hypotheses about\nthe function, while a larger one may slow down convergence dramatically. Here\nwe tackle the issue of low-dimensional domain selection based on a detailed\nstudy of the properties of the random embedding, giving insight on the\naforementioned difficulties. In particular, we describe a minimal\nlow-dimensional set in correspondence with the embedded search space. We\nadditionally show that an alternative equivalent embedding procedure yields\nsimultaneously a simpler definition of the low-dimensional minimal set and\nbetter properties in practice. Finally, the performance and robustness gains of\nthe proposed enhancements for Bayesian optimization are illustrated on\nnumerical examples. \n\n"}

For example, raw sensor\ndata from a fitness-tracking application can be expressed as a timeline of a\nselect few actions (i.e., walking, sitting, running). However, discovering\nthese patterns is challenging because it requires simultaneous segmentation and\nclustering of the time series. Furthermore, interpreting the resulting clusters\nis difficult, especially when the data is high-dimensional. Here we propose a\nnew method of model-based clustering, which we call Toeplitz Inverse\nCovariance-based Clustering (TICC).

The\nconvergence and local convergence speed of ALM have been extensively studied.\nHowever, the global convergence rate of inexact ALM is still open for problems\nwith nonlinear inequality constraints.

For these problems, we\nestablish the global convergence rate of inexact ALM and estimate its iteration\ncomplexity in terms of the number of gradient evaluations to produce a solution\nwith a specified accuracy.\n  We first establish an ergodic convergence rate result of inexact ALM that\nuses constant penalty parameters or geometrically increasing penalty\nparameters. Based on the convergence rate result, we apply Nesterov's optimal\nfirst-order method on each primal subproblem and estimate the iteration\ncomplexity of the inexact ALM.

When the discount function is log sub-additive and the state process is\none-dimensional, an optimal equilibrium is constructed in a specific form,\nunder appropriate regularity and integrability conditions.

Specifically,\nthe UAVs first charge the GTs by transmitting the wireless energy transfer\n(WET) signals in the downlink. Then, by utilizing the harvested wireless energy\nfrom the UAVs, the GTs send their uplink wireless information transmission\n(WIT) signals to the UAVs. In this paper, depending on the operations of the\nUAVs, we adopt two different scenarios, namely integrated UAV and separated UAV\nWPCNs. First, in the integrated UAV WPCN, a UAV acts as a hybrid AP in which\nboth energy transfer and information reception are processed at a single UAV.\nIn contrast, for the separated UAV WPCN, we consider two UAVs each of which\nbehaves as an energy AP and an information AP independently, and thus the\nenergy transfer and the information decoding are separately performed at two\ndifferent UAVs. For both systems, we jointly optimize the trajectories of the\nUAVs, the uplink power control, and the time resource allocation for the WET\nand the WIT to maximize the minimum throughput of the GTs.

The motivation for\nstudying this pressing problem originates from the fact that the classical\nnumerical tools used to solve low-dimensional optimal control problems are\ncomputationally infeasible for large-scale systems. Furthermore, although the\nmatrices of large-scale FE or FD models are usually sparse banded or highly\nstructured, the optimal control solution computed using the classical methods\nis dense and unstructured. Consequently, it is not suitable for efficient\ncentralized and distributed real-time implementations. We show that the a\npriori (sparsity) patterns of the exact solutions of the generalized Lyapunov\nequations for FE and FD models are banded matrices. The a priori pattern\npredicts the dominant non-zero entries of the exact solution.

(i) We develop a regularized and smoothed\nvariable sample-size BFGS update (rsL-BFGS) that generates a sequence of\nHessian approximations and can accommodate nonsmooth convex objectives by\nutilizing iterative regularization and smoothing. (ii) In strongly convex\nregimes with state-dependent noise, the proposed variable sample-size\nstochastic quasi-Newton scheme admits a non-asymptotic linear rate of\nconvergence while the oracle complexity of computing an $\\epsilon$-solution is\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\kappa^{m+1}/\\epsilon)$ where $\\kappa$ is the condition number and\n$m\\geq 1$.

In an attempt to shed some light on why this is the case, we\nrevisit some minimax properties of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for the\nsquare loss of linear models---originally developed in the 1990's---and extend\nthem to general stochastic mirror descent (SMD) algorithms for general loss\nfunctions and nonlinear models.

The constant is of the form $e^{\\frac{K}{T}}$, where $K$\ndepends only on the geometry of $M$ and $\\omega$.

A global attractor is the minimal\nset that attracts all bounded sets; it contains all forward-time limit points.\nOur approach uses (generalised) Lyapunov functions to find attracting sets,\nwhich must contain the global attractor, and the choice of Lyapunov function is\noptimised based on the quantity whose extreme value one aims to bound. We also\npresent a non-global framework for bounding extrema over the minimal set that\nis attracting in a specified region of state space. If the dynamics are\ngoverned by ordinary differential equations, and the equations and quantities\nof interest are polynomial, then our methods can be implemented computationally\nusing polynomial optimisation. In particular, we enforce nonnegativity of\ncertain polynomial expressions by requiring them to be representable as sums of\nsquares, leading to a convex optimisation problem that can be recast as a\nsemidefinite program and solved computationally. This computer assistance lets\none construct complicated polynomial Lyapunov functions. Computations are\nillustrated using three examples. The first is the chaotic Lorenz system, where\nwe bound extreme values of various monomials of the coordinates over the global\nattractor.

Our focus is the behavior of the so-called \"plug-in\" estimator, which is\nsimply the rate-distortion function of the empirical distribution of the\nobserved data. Sufficient conditions are given for its consistency, and\nexamples are provided to demonstrate that in certain cases it fails to converge\nto the true rate-distortion function. The analysis of its performance is\ncomplicated by the fact that the rate-distortion function is not continuous in\nthe source distribution; the underlying mathematical problem is closely related\nto the classical problem of establishing the consistency of maximum likelihood\nestimators. General consistency results are given for the plug-in estimator\napplied to a broad class of sources, including all stationary and ergodic ones.\nA more general class of estimation problems is also considered, arising in the\ncontext of lossy data compression when the allowed class of coding\ndistributions is restricted; analogous results are developed for the plug-in\nestimator in that case. Finally, consistency theorems are formulated for\nmodified (e.g., penalized) versions of the plug-in, and for estimating the\noptimal reproduction distribution. \n\n"}

Confidential messages are transmitted to their respective receivers\nwith information-theoretic secrecy. That is, each receiver is kept in total\nignorance with respect to the message intended for the other receiver. The\nsecrecy level is measured by the equivocation rate at the eavesdropping\nreceiver. In this paper, we present inner and outer bounds on secrecy capacity\nregions for these two communication systems. The derived outer bounds have an\nidentical mutual information expression that applies to both channel models.\nThe difference is in the input distributions over which the expression is\noptimized. The inner bound rate regions are achieved by random binning\ntechniques. For the broadcast channel, a double-binning coding scheme allows\nfor both joint encoding and preserving of confidentiality. Furthermore, we show\nthat, for a special case of the interference channel, referred to as the switch\nchannel, the two bound bounds meet. Finally, we describe several transmission\nschemes for Gaussian interference channels and derive their achievable rate\nregions while ensuring mutual information-theoretic secrecy. An encoding scheme\nin which transmitters dedicate some of their power to create artificial noise\nis proposed and shown to outperform both time-sharing and simple multiplexed\ntransmission of the confidential messages. \n\n"}
