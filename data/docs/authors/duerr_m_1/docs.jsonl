X-ray observations reveal a bullet-like subcluster\nwith a prominent bow shock, while lensing results show that the positions of\nthe total mass peaks are consistent with the centroids of the collisionless\ngalaxies (and inconsistent with the X-ray brightness peaks). Previous studies,\nbased on older observational datasets, have placed upper limits on the\nself-interaction cross-section of dark matter per unit mass, sigma/m, using\nsimplified analytic techniques. In this work, we take advantage of new,\nhigher-quality observational datasets by running N-body simulations of\n1E0657-56 that include the effects of self-interacting dark matter, and\ncomparing the results with observations. Furthermore, the recent data allow for\na new independent method of constraining sigma/m, based on the non-observation\nof an offset between the bullet subcluster mass peak and galaxy centroid. This\nnew method places an upper limit (68% confidence) of sigma/m < 1.25 cm^2/g. If\nwe make the assumption that the subcluster and the main cluster had equal\nmass-to-light ratios prior to the merger, we derive our most stringent\nconstraint of sigma/m < 0.7 cm^2/g, which comes from the consistency of the\nsubcluster's observed mass-to-light ratio with the main cluster's, and with the\nuniversal cluster value, ruling out the possibility of a large fraction of dark\nmatter particles being scattered away due to collisions. Our limit is a slight\nimprovement over the previous result from analytic estimates, and rules out\nmost of the 0.5 - 5cm^2/g range invoked to explain inconsistencies between the\nstandard collisionless cold dark matter model and observations. \n\n"}

Hidden\ncharged dark matter has many novel properties not shared by neutral dark\nmatter: (1) bound state formation and Sommerfeld-enhanced annihilation after\nchemical freeze out may reduce its relic density, (2) similar effects greatly\nenhance dark matter annihilation in protohalos at redshifts of z ~ 30, (3)\nCompton scattering off hidden photons delays kinetic decoupling, suppressing\nsmall scale structure, and (4) Rutherford scattering makes such dark matter\nself-interacting and collisional, potentially impacting properties of the\nBullet Cluster and the observed morphology of galactic halos.

After chemical decoupling, or freeze-out, dark matter no\nlonger annihilates but is still kept in local thermal equilibrium due to\nscattering events with the much more abundant standard model particles.

The current excess in the diphoton\nchannel is twice that expected from a Standard Model Higgs; whilst this may\nwell change with more statistics, it is interesting to consider the\nimplications should the result persist. Here, we assess whether the NMSSM with\na neutralino dark matter candidate could explain this excess when astrophysical\nconstraints (e.g. no overproduction of gamma rays and radio emission in the\ngalaxy, no anomalous excess in the dark matter direct detection experiments and\nno dark matter overabundance) are imposed on the neutralino. This enables us to\ndisregard unphysical regions of the parameter space even though the Higgs\nsignal is compatible with the observed excess. The result of our analysis is\nthat there are configurations of the parameter space which can explain the\nsignal strength reported by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations for a Higgs mass\nwithin the required range. Should the observed signal strength finally be\ncompatible with Standard Model expectations, it would be difficult to\ndistinguish between the discovery of Standard Model Higgs and a SM-like Higgs\nfrom the NMSSM, unless one performs dedicated searches of very light Higgs\nbosons and possibly investigate peculiar signatures of supersymmetric\nparticles.

Theoretically, there exist\nnumerous inflationary scenarios which predict large and characteristic\nnon-Gaussianities in the primordial perturbations. These model-dependent\nnon-Gaussianities act as sources of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)\nbispectrum; therefore, the analysis of the CMB bispectrum is very important and\nattractive in order to clarify the nature of the early Universe. Currently, the\nimpacts of the primordial non-Gaussianities in the scalar perturbations, where\nthe rotational and parity invariances are kept, on the CMB bispectrum have been\nwell-studied. However, for a complex treatment, the CMB bispectra generated\nfrom the non-Gaussianities, which originate from the vector- and tensor-mode\nperturbations and include the violation of the rotational or parity invariance,\nhave never been considered in spite of the importance of this information. On\nthe basis of our current studies, this thesis provides the general formalism\nfor the CMB bispectrum sourced by the non-Gaussianities not only in the\nscalar-mode perturbations but also in the vector- and tensor-mode\nperturbations. Applying this formalism, we calculate the CMB bispectrum from\ntwo scalars and a graviton correlation and that from primordial magnetic\nfields, and we then outline new constraints on these amplitudes. Furthermore,\nthis formalism can be easily extended to the cases where the rotational or\nparity invariance is broken.

In\nthis paper, we make several suggestions to try to clarify the role of new\nphysics in these results. We propose that the enhancement needed in the\nStandard Model to attribute the observed CP violation in D to two pseudoscalar\nmodes may not operate for inclusive final states where asymmetries will likely\napproximate the quark level expectation. Experimentally testing this principle\nrequires a search for CP asymmetries in final states containing K and K-bar\nwith a total energy of less than M_D. We also propose that CP asymmetries may\nbe enhanced in modes where the tree is color suppressed. In particular, the\nfinal state rho0 rho0 is of special interest; similarly Ds-> rho0 K+ and rho0\nK*+ likewise appear interesting. We discuss how isospin symmetry yields\nobservables sensitive to certain classes of new physics and suppressed in the\nStandard Model. Some modes considered in this context are D-> pi pi, rho pi,\nrho rho as well as Ds-> K* pi.

We find that the current limits on the contact\ninteraction scale Lambda in the EFT apply to theories that are perturbative for\ndark matter mass m_DM < 800 GeV. However, for all values of m_DM in these\ntheories, the mediator width is larger than the mass, so that a particle-like\ninterpretation of the mediator is doubtful. Furthermore, consistency with the\nthermal relic density occurs only for 170 <m_DM < 520 GeV.

By considering ${\\rm Tr} (\\hat{U}_4\\hat{\\not D}^{N_t-1})$, we\nanalytically derive a gauge-invariant relation between the Polyakov loop\n$\\langle L_P \\rangle$ and the Dirac eigenvalues $\\lambda_n$ in QCD, i.e.,\n$\\langle L_P \\rangle \\propto \\sum_n \\lambda_n^{N_t -1} \\langle n|\\hat U_4|n\n\\rangle$, which is a Dirac spectral representation of the Polyakov loop in\nterms of Dirac eigenmodes $|n\\rangle$.

Also in lattice QCD\ncalculations in both confined and deconfined phases, we numerically confirm the\nanalytical relation, non-zero finiteness of $\\langle n|\\hat U_4|n \\rangle$ for\neach Dirac mode, and negligibly small contribution from low-lying Dirac modes\nto the Polyakov loop, i.e., the Polyakov loop is almost unchanged even by\nremoving low-lying Dirac-mode contribution from the QCD vacuum generated by\nlattice QCD simulations.

Their reduction to four dimensions breaks\nsupersymmetry whose magnitude depends both on the compactifying manifold and\nthe mechanism that generates the breaking. In particular compactifications,\nnotably on a $S_1/Z_2$ orbifold, the breaking of supersymmetry occuring on a\nhidden brane, residing at one end of $S_1/Z_2$, is communicated to the visible\nbrane which lies at the other end, via gravitational interactions propagating\nin the bulk. This scenario has been exemplified in the framework of the $N=2$,\n$D=5$ supergravity. In this note, motivated by the recent developments in the\nfield, related to the six-dimensional description of the supergravity theory,\nwe study the $N=2$, $D=5$ supergravity theory as originating from a $D=6$\nsupergravity which, in addition to the gravity, includes a number of tensor\nmultiplets.

For heavy ($\\sim TeV$) DM, the kinetic energy of WIMPs\nin large (galaxy-sized or larger) halos is capable of producing low-energy\npositrons.

These stable particles are typically a\nsubdominant DM component, but because they are produced with a large Lorentz\nboost in this process, they can be detected in large volume terrestrial\nexperiments via neutral-current-like interactions with electrons or nuclei.\nThis novel DM signal thus combines the production mechanism associated with\nindirect detection experiments (i.e. galactic DM annihilation) with the\ndetection mechanism associated with direct detection experiments (i.e. DM\nscattering off terrestrial targets). Such processes are generically present in\nmulti-component DM scenarios or those with non-minimal DM stabilization\nsymmetries. As a proof of concept, we present a model of two-component thermal\nrelic DM, where the dominant heavy DM species has no tree-level interactions\nwith the standard model and thus largely evades direct and indirect DM bounds.\nInstead, its thermal relic abundance is set by annihilation into a subdominant\nlighter DM species, and the latter can be detected in the boosted channel via\nthe same annihilation process occurring today.

One promising way to affect structure formation on small scales is a\nrelatively strong coupling of dark matter to neutrinos. We construct an\nexperimentally viable, simple, renormalizable, model with new interactions\nbetween neutrinos and dark matter. We show that addressing the small scale\nstructure problems requires dark matter with a mass that is tens of MeV, and a\npresent-day density determined by an initial particle-antiparticle asymmetry in\nthe dark sector. Generating a sufficiently large dark matter-neutrino coupling\nrequires a new heavy neutrino with a mass around 100 MeV.

We discuss one by one the following various dark matter production\nregimes of this kind: freeze-in, reannihilation and dark freeze-out.

At\nthis stage, however, an effective field theory framework provides a useful way\nto parametrize searches for this resonance in other channels. Assuming that the\nexcess is due to a new scalar or pseudoscalar boson, we study associated\nproduction of $S$ (\"$S$-strahlung\") at the LHC and propose searches in several\nclean channels like $\\gamma\\gamma\\ell\\ell$, $\\gamma\\gamma\\ell\\eslash$ and\n$\\ell\\ell\\ell\\gamma\\eslash$ to probe dimension-5 operators coupling $S$ to\nStandard Model gauge bosons.

The creation mechanism makes the vector bosons' energy spectral\ndensity $\\rho_{cdm}/\\Delta E$ very high. Therefore, the dark electric dipole\ntransition rate in atoms is boosted if the energy gap between atomic states\nequals the mass of the vector bosons. By using the Zeeman effect, the energy\ngap between the 2S state and the 2P state in hydrogen atoms or hydrogen like\nions can be tuned. The $2S$ state can be populated with electrons due to its\nrelatively long life, which is about $1/7$s. When the energy gap between the\nsemi-ground $2S$ state and the 2P state matches the mass of the cosmic vector\nbosons, induced transitions occur and the 2P state subsequently decays into the\n1S state.

This approach differs from previous work\nin that it does not implicitly assume that each static zero mode is associated\nwith a dynamical zero mode.

In our setup, both of the\nvisible sector and the hidden sector co-exist on the infrared (IR) brane. We\nintroduce the Polonyi model as a simple hidden sector. Due to the warped\nmetric, the effective cutoff scale on the IR brane is ``warped down'', so that\nthe gravity mediation occurs at a low scale. As a result, the gravitino is\nnaturally the lightest superpartner (LSP) and contact interactions between the\nhidden and the visible sector fields become stronger. We address\nphenomenologies for various IR cutoff scales. In particular, we investigate\ncollider phenomenology involving a scalar field (Polonyi field) in the hidden\nsector for the case with the IR cutoff around 10 TeV.

One could hope that this problem\ndisappears if one represents the global symmetry of a pseudoscalar axion field\nas a gauge symmetry of the Ogievetsky-Polubarinov-Kalb-Ramond antisymmetric\ntensor field. We will show, however, that this gauge symmetry does not protect\nthe axion mass from quantum corrections. The amplitude of gravitational effects\nviolating global symmetries could be strongly suppressed by e^{-S}, where S is\nthe action of a wormhole which may eat the global charge. Unfortunately, in a\nwide variety of theories based on the Einstein theory of gravity the action\nappears to be fairly small, S = O(10).

We calculate the\nstructure of NS interiors with the EOS comprising both phases, and we find that\nthe NS maximum masses are never larger than 1.7 solar masses, no matter the\nmodel chosen for describing the pure quark phase. \n\n"}

Effective chiral\nmodels such as the linear and nonlinear sigma model will be discussed as well\nas the essential ideas of chiral perturbation theory. Some applications to the\nphysics of ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions will be presented. \n\n"}

Use of high current polarized\nelectron beams, polarized targets, and recoil polarimeters, in conjunction with\nmodern spectrometers and detector instrumentation allow much more detailed\nstudies of nucleon and nuclear structure than has been possible in the past.\nThe CEBAF accelerator at Jefferson Lab was build to study the internal\nstructure of hadrons in a regime where confinement is important and strong\ninteraction QCD is the relevant theory. I discuss how the first experiments\nalready make significant contributions towards an improved understanding of\nhadronic structure. \n\n"}
{"id": "physics/0305075", "contents": "Title: Neutrinos from San Marco and Below Abstract: Order of magnitude estimates of radiogenic heat and antineutrino production\nare given, using the San Marco cathedral as an example. Prospects of\ndetermining the radiogenic contribution to terrestrial heat by detection of\nantineutrinos from natural radioactivity (geoneutrinos) are discussed. A three\nkton scintillator detector in three years can clearly discriminate among\ndifferent models of terrestrial heat production. In addition, the study of\ngeoneutrinos offers a possibility of improving the determination of neutrino\nmass and mixing, by exploiting the knowledge of Th/U abundance in the Earth. \n\n"}
