Marginalization can then be employed to\nintegrate the resulting probability density function (pdf) over the EFT\nparameters that are not of specific interest in the fit. We also explore\nmarginalization over the order of the EFT calculation, M, and over the\nvariable, R, that encodes the inherent ambiguity in the notion that these\nparameters are O(1). This results in a very general formula for the pdf of the\nEFT parameters of interest given a data set, D.

New experimental data on nucleon spin\nstructure at low to intermediate momentum transfers combined with existing high\nmomentum transfer data offer a comprehensive picture in the strong region of\nthe interaction and of the transition region from the strong to the\nasymptotic-free region. Insight for some aspects of the theory for the strong\ninteraction, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), is gained by exploring lower moments\nof spin structure functions and their corresponding sum rules. These moments\nare expressed in terms of an operator-product expansion using quark and gluon\ndegrees of freedom at moderately large momentum transfers. The higher-twist\ncontributions have been examined through the evolution of these moments as the\nmomentum transfer varies from higher to lower values. Furthermore, QCD-inspired\nlow-energy effective theories, which explicitly include chiral symmetry\nbreaking, are tested at low momentum transfers.

We analyze the energy spectra of current geoneutrino data in\ncombination with solar and long-baseline reactor neutrino data, with\nmarginalized three-neutrino oscillation parameters.

Interesting bounds or\nindications emerge on the Th+U geoneutrino rates and on the Th/U ratio, in\nbroad agreement with typical Earth model expectations.

Thus, precise measurements of\ncorrelations in neutron decay can be used to study the SM as well to search for\nevidence of possible extensions to it.

Of the many possibilities, three experiments are\ndescribed here that are clearly feasible and of high scientific importance.\nFirst, a direct measurement of the saturation scale is possible using the\nbroadening of the transverse momentum distribution of hadrons produced in\nsemi-inclusive DIS. This connection to saturation physics will provide a\nquantitative measure of the degree to which this fundamental QCD phenomenon is\noccurring, and has important consequences in other high-energy scattering\nstudies. Second, the measurement of quark energy loss is feasible, either as a\ndirect measurement at a lower-energy EIC, or as an indirect measurement using\nhadron attenuation at higher energies. Such a measurement will offer the first\nexperimental validation of the energy independence of this process, which is a\nconsequence of the QCD analog of the LPM effect in QED. The third experiment is\nto determine the mechanisms of hadronization using the nucleus as a spatial\nanalyzer, intercomparing hadron attenuation for nuclei of a range of sizes. The\nextended reach of the EIC in energy will allow probes of these mechanisms in\nthe crucial high-z region for the heaviest nuclei, and will permit study of\nhadronization in heavy quark meson and baryon systems. \n\n"}

The early years of this period were\nchronicled in the Quarkonium Working Group (QWG) CERN Yellow Report (YR) in\n2004, which presented a comprehensive review of the status of the field at that\ntime and provided specific recommendations for further progress. However, the\nbroad spectrum of subsequent breakthroughs, surprises, and continuing puzzles\ncould only be partially anticipated. Since the release of the YR, the BESII\nprogram concluded only to give birth to BESIII; the $B$-factories and CLEO-c\nflourished; quarkonium production and polarization measurements at HERA and the\nTevatron matured; and heavy-ion collisions at RHIC have opened a window on the\ndeconfinement regime. All these experiments leave legacies of quality,\nprecision, and unsolved mysteries for quarkonium physics, and therefore beg for\ncontinuing investigations. The plethora of newly-found quarkonium-like states\nunleashed a flood of theoretical investigations into new forms of matter such\nas quark-gluon hybrids, mesonic molecules, and tetraquarks. Measurements of the\nspectroscopy, decays, production, and in-medium behavior of c\\bar{c}, b\\bar{b},\nand b\\bar{c} bound states have been shown to validate some theoretical\napproaches to QCD and highlight lack of quantitative success for others.

One of the component parts of this\ncalculation is the production of a standard model Higgs boson, gg -> H and its\nsubsequent decay, H -> W+(-> \\nu l) W-(-> l \\nu). We will quantify the\nimportance of the interference between the Higgs boson production process and\nthe gluon-induced continuum production in the context of searches for the Higgs\nboson at the Tevatron and the LHC. For instance, for mH < 140 GeV the effect of\nthe interference typically results in around a 10% reduction in the expected\nnumber of Higgs signal events. The majority of this interference is due to\nnon-resonant contributions. Therefore cuts on the transverse mass such as those\ncurrently used by the ATLAS collaboration reduce the destructive interference\nto about a 1% effect.

In\ncontrasting this behaviour with that produced by a momentum-dependent\ninteraction, one achieves comparisons which highlight that elastic scattering\nand resonance electroproduction experiments probe the infrared evolution of\nQCD's running masses; e.g., the existence, and location if so, of a zero in the\nratio of nucleon Sachs form factors are strongly influenced by the running of\nthe dressed-quark mass. In our description of baryons, diquark correlations are\nimportant. These correlations are instrumental in producing a zero in the Dirac\nform factor of the proton's d-quark; and in determining d_v/u_v(x=1), as we\nshow via a formula that expresses d_v/u_v(x=1) in terms of the nucleon's\ndiquark content.

In this paper, Dm31^2 is\nmeasured from disappearance probabilities of the three reactor experiments\nwhich have different baselines, to be 2.99^{+1.13}_{-1.58}(^{+0.86}_{-0.88}) X\n10^{-3}eV^2, where the errors are two (one) dimensional uncertainties.

We test assumptions\nassociated with \\pp collision centrality and the UE. We determine the nature of\nthe UE and explore the relation between jet production and \\pp centrality.

The jet contribution to $N_\\perp$ may represent a\nuniversal large-angle base common to all dijets that extends across $2\\pi$\nazimuth.

We calculate the two-gluon production cross section while\nincluding all-order saturation effects in the heavy nucleus with the\nlowest-order rescattering in the lighter nucleus.

The geometric correlations (i) are due to the fact\nthat nucleons are correlated by simply being confined within the same nucleus\nand may lead to long-range rapidity correlations for the produced particles\nwithout strong azimuthal angle dependence.

We consider two\ndetector technologies for atmospheric neutrinos - magnetized iron calorimeter\nand non-magnetized Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber.

For the long baseline experiments, a precise measurement of\ntheta_{13}, which can exclude degenerate solutions in the wrong octant,\nincreases the sensitivity drastically. For theta_{23} = 39^o and sin^2 2\ntheta_{13} = 0.1, at least ~2 sigma sensitivity can be achieved by T2K+NOvA for\nall values of delta_{CP} for both normal and inverted hierarchy.

At present there is\ngood agreement between experiment and ChPT calculations, including the $\\pi\\pi$\nand $\\pi$N s wave scattering lengths and the $\\pi^{0}$ lifetime. Recent,\naccurate pionic atom data are in agreement with chiral calculations once\nisospin breaking effects due to the mass difference of the up and down quarks\nare taken into account, as was required to extract the $\\pi\\pi$ scattering\nlengths. In addition to tests of the theory, comparisons between $\\pi\\pi$ and\n$\\pi$N interactions based on general chiral principles are discussed. Lattice\ncalculations are now providing results for the fundamental, long and\ninconclusively studied, $\\pi$N $\\sigma$ term and the contribution of the\nstrange quark to the mass of the proton. Increasingly accurate experiments in\nelectromagnetic pion production experiments from the proton which test ChPT\ncalculations (and their energy region of validity) are presented.

Leptons,\nwhen compared to hadrons, have only little interaction with the strongly\ninteracting system. Thus, dileptons provide ideal penetrating probes that allow\nthe study of such a system throughout its space-time evolution. In the low mass\nrange ($M_{ll}<1.1$ GeV/$c^2$), the dominant source of dileptons originates\nfrom the decay of vector mesons which may see effects from chiral symmetry\nrestoration. In the intermediate mass range ($1.1<M_{ll}<3.0 $ GeV/$c^2$), the\nmain contributions to the mass spectrum are expected to originate from the\nthermal radiation of a quark-gluon plasma as well as the decays of charm\nmesons. In the high mass range ($M_{ll}>3.0$ GeV/$c^2$), dilepton measurements\nare expected to see contributions from primordial processes involving heavy\nquarks, and Drell-Yan production.\n  With the introduction of the Time-of-Flight detector, the STAR detector has\nbeen able to perform large acceptance, high purity electron identification.

In\nparticular, a putative neutrino magnetic dipole moment mu_nu enhances the\nplasmon decay process, postpones helium ignition in low-mass stars, and\ntherefore extends the red-giant branch (RGB) in globular clusters (GCs).

Arguably the best process to study this coupling is the associa ted\nproduction of Higgs boson along with a $t\\bar t$ pair in a machine like the\nInternational Linear Collider (ILC). While detailed analyses of the sensitivity\nof the measurement assuming a Standard Model (SM) - like coupling are available\nin the context of ILC, conclude that th e coupling could be pinned down at\nabout 10\\% level with modest luminosity, our investigations show that the\nscenario could be different in case of a more general coupling. The modified\nLorentz structure resulting in a changed functional dependence of the cross\nsection on the couplin g, along with the difference in the cross section itself\nleads to considerable deviation in the sensitivity. Our studies with an ILC of\ncenter of mass energies of 500 GeV, 800 GeV and 1000 GeV show that moderate\nCP-mixing in the Higgs sector could change the sensitivity to about 20\\ %,\nwhile it could be worsened to 75\\% in cases which could accommodate more\ndramatic changes in the coupling.

This study strongly suggests that, a joint\nanalysis of the CP properties and the Yukawa coupling measurement would be the\nway forward at the ILC and that caution must be excercised in the measurem ent\nof the Yukawa couplings and the conclusions drawn from it. \n\n"}

Both\nof the BaBar asymmetry and ours are naively thought to be T-odd since two\nprocesses compared are related with flipping time direction. We investigate the\ntime reversal transformation property of our asymmetry. Using our notation, one\ncan see that the asymmetry is not precisely a T-odd quantity, taking into\naccount indirect CP and CPT violation of K meson systems. The effect of\n$\\epsilon_K$ is extracted and gives rise to $\\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$\ncontribution. The introduced parameters are invariant under rephasing of quarks\nso that the coefficients of our asymmetry are expressed as phase convention\nindependent quantities. Some combinations of the asymmetry enable us to extract\nparameters for wrong sign decays of $B_d$ meson, CPT violation, etc. We also\nstudy the reason why the T-even terms are allowed to contribute to the\nasymmetry, and find that several conditions are needed for the asymmetry to be\na T-odd quantity. \n\n"}

In events with high multiplicity, however, the\nstandard approach to tag boosted resonances by a large-radius fat jet becomes\ndifficult because the resonances are not well-separated from other hard\nradiation. In this paper, we propose a different approach to tag and\nreconstruct boosted resonances by using the recently proposed mass-jump jet\nalgorithm. A key feature of the algorithm is the flexible radius of the jets,\nwhich results from a terminating veto that prevents the recombination of two\nhard prongs if their combined jet mass is substantially larger than the masses\nof the separate prongs. The idea of collecting jets in \"buckets\" is also used.\nAs an example, we consider the fully hadronic final state of pair-produced\nvectorlike top partners at the LHC, $pp\\to T\\bar{T}\\to t\\bar{t}HH$, and show\nthat the new approach works better than the corresponding generalized $k_T$ jet\nclustering algorithm.

Its extension to the\nmulti-reference level allows for restoring symmetries and, in turn, for\ncalculating transition rates.\n  [Purpose] We propose a new no-core-configuration-interaction (NCCI) model\ntreating properly isospin and rotational symmetries. The model is applicable to\nany nucleus irrespective of its mass and neutron- and proton-number parity. It\nproperly includes polarization effects caused by an interplay between the long-\nand short-range forces acting in the atomic nucleus.\n  [Methods] The method is based on solving the Hill-Wheeler-Griffin equation\nwithin a model space built of linearly-dependent states having good angular\nmomentum and properly treated isobaric spin. The states are generated by means\nof the isospin and angular-momentum projection applied to a set of low-lying\n(multi)particle-(multi)hole deformed Slater determinants calculated using the\nself-consistent Skyrme-Hartree-Fock approach.\n  [Results] The theory is applied to calculate energy spectra in N~Z nuclei\nthat are relevant from the point of view of a study of superallowed Fermi\nbeta-decays.

Theoretical Framework Abstract: We develop a theoretical approach for nuclear spectral functions at high\nmissing momenta and removal energies based on the multi-nucleon short-range\ncorrelation~(SRC) model. The approach is based on the effective Feynman\ndiagrammatic method which allows to account for the relativistic effects\nimportant in the SRC domain. In addition to two-nucleon SRC with center of mass\nmotion we derive also the contribution of three-nucleon SRCs to the nuclear\nspectral functions. The latter is modeled based on the assumption that 3N SRCs\nare a product of two sequential short range NN interactions. This approach\nallowed us to express the 3N SRC part of the nuclear spectral function as a\nconvolution of two NN SRCs. Thus the knowledge of 2N SRCs allows us to model\nboth two- and three-nucleon SRC contributions to the spectral function. The\nderivations of the spectral functions are based on the two theoretical\nframeworks in evaluating covariant Feynman diagrams: In the first, referred as\nvirtual nucleon approximation, we reduce Feynman diagrams to the time ordered\nnoncovariant diagrams by evaluating nucleon spectators in the SRC at their\npositive energy poles, neglecting explicitly the contribution from vacuum\ndiagrams.

The small-angle capability of the new Super High Momentum Spectrometer\n(SHMS) in Hall C, coupled with its high momentum reach - up to the anticipated\n11-GeV beam energy in Hall C - and coincidence capability with the\nwell-understood High Momentum Spectrometer, will allow for probes of such\nhadron structure involving strangeness down to the smallest distance scales to\ndate. To cleanly select the kaons, a threshold aerogel Cerenkov detector has\nbeen constructed for the SHMS. The detector consists of an aerogel tray\nfollowed by a diffusion box. Four trays for aerogel of nominal refractive\nindices of n=1.030, 1.020, 1.015 and 1.011 were constructed. The tray\ncombination will allow for identification of kaons from 1 GeV/c up to 7.2\nGeV/c, reaching 10^-2 proton and 10^-3 pion rejection, with kaon detection\nefficiency better than 95%. The diffusion box of the detector is equipped with\n14 five-inch diameter photomultiplier tubes. Its interior walls are covered\nwith Gore diffusive reflector, which is superior to the commonly used Millipore\npaper and improved the detector performance by 35%. The inner surface of the\ntwo aerogel trays with higher refractive index is covered with Millipore paper,\nhowever, those two trays with lower aerogel refractive index are again covered\nwith Gore diffusive reflector for higher performance.

In this letter, we discuss three\ndifferent types of simplified models for this possible excess. In the first\nclass of models, we assume a new resonance couples to both b bar{b} and mu^+\nmu^-. Within the allowed parameter space for the ALEPH data, this type of\nmodels is excluded because of too large Drell-Yan production of dimuon from the\nb bar{b} collision at the LHC. In the second model, we assume that the 30 GeV\nexcess is a new gauge boson Z' that couples to the SM b and a new vectorlike\nsinglet B quark heavier than Z and not to b bar{b}. Then one can account for\nthe ALEPH data without conflict with the DY constraint. The new vectorlike\nquark B can be pair produced at the LHC 8/13 TeV by QCD with sigma(BB) ~\nO(100-1000) pb, and Bq production rate is sigma(Bq) ~ a few pb which is larger\nthan sigma(Bb) roughly by an order of magnitude. Their signatures at the LHC\nwould be 2b + 4mu, bj + 2mu and 2b + 2mu, respectively, which however might\nhave been excluded already by LHC run I and II data since the multi-muon events\nhave low SM background and are rare at the LHC.

The key\nobservation is that track multiplicity is approximately Poisson distributed,\nwith more suppressed tails than the Sudakov peak structure from jet mass. By\nusing an iterated version of the soft drop jet grooming algorithm, we can\ndefine a \"soft drop multiplicity\" which is Poisson distributed at\nleading-logarithmic accuracy. In addition, we calculate the\nnext-to-leading-logarithmic corrections to this Poisson structure. If we allow\nthe soft drop groomer to proceed to the end of the jet branching history, we\ncan define a collinear-unsafe (but still infrared-safe) counting observable.\nExploiting the universality of the collinear limit, we define generalized\nfragmentation functions to study the perturbative energy evolution of\ncollinear-unsafe multiplicity. \n\n"}

That published analysis\ndoes not constrain the magnitude of the effect; it only tests models with and\nwithout the effect against the data. Other MINERvA analyses need an expression\nof the model uncertainty in the RPA effect. A well-described uncertainty can be\nused for systematics for unfolding, for model errors in the analysis of non-QE\nsamples, and as input for fitting exercises for model testing or constraining\nbackgrounds. This prescription takes uncertainties on the parameters in the\nValencia RPA model and adds a (not-as-tight) constraint from muon capture data.\nFor MINERvA we apply it as a 2D ($q_0$,$q_3$) weight to GENIE events, in lieu\nof generating a full beyond-Fermi-gas quasielastic events.

A model defect is usually a\nfunction of energy and describes the difference between the model prediction\nand the truth. Of course, neither the truth nor the model defect are\naccessible. A Gaussian process (GP) enables to define a probability\ndistribution on possible shapes of a model defect by referring to intuitively\nunderstandable concepts such as smoothness and the expected magnitude of the\ndefect. Standard specifications of GPs impose a typical length-scale and\namplitude valid for the whole energy range, which is often not justified, e.g.,\nwhen the model covers both the resonance and statistical range. In this\ncontribution, we show how a GP with energy-dependent length-scales and\namplitudes can be constructed from available experimental data. The proposed\nconstruction is inspired by a technique called dynamic time warping used, e.g.,\nfor speech recognition. We demonstrate the feasibility of the data-driven\ndetermination of model defects by inferring a model defect of the nuclear\nmodels code TALYS for (n,p) reactions of isotopes with charge number between 20\nand 30. The newly introduced GP parametrization besides its potential to\nimprove evaluations for reactor relevant isotopes, such as $^{56}$Fe, may also\nhelp to better understand the performance of nuclear models in the future. \n\n"}

Some examples\nare strongly interacting medium and heavy mass atomic nuclei and mesoscopic\ncondensed matter systems. In this approach, the linear Schrodinger equation for\nthe exact many-body wave function is mapped onto a non-linear density-dependent\none-body potential problem. This approximation, not only provides\ncomputationally very simple solutions even for systems with many particles, but\ndue to the non-linearity, it also allows for obtaining solutions that break\nessential symmetries of the system, often connected with phase transitions. In\nthis way, additional correlations are subsumed in the system. However, the\nmean-field approach suffers from the drawback that the corresponding wave\nfunctions do not have sharp quantum numbers and, therefore, many results cannot\nbe compared directly with experimental data.

These fields hold for more than 11 hours with\nleakage currents less than 170 pA (about 20% of the maximum tolerable in the\nEDM experiment). The system is also found to be robust against anticipated\nradiation backgrounds. Preliminary results for superfluid show that fields of\nat least 30 kV/cm can be sustained at the volumes required for the EDM\nexperiment, about 60% of the design goal. These results are likely limited by\nthe low pressure that must be maintained above the superfluid bath. \n\n"}
{"id": "physics/9811025", "contents": "Title: New Physics Discovery Potential in Future Experiments Abstract: We propose a method to estimate the probability of new physics discovery in\nfuture high energy physics experiments. Physics simulation gives both the\naverage numbers <Nb> of background and <Ns> of signal events. We find that the\nproper definition of the significance for <Nb>, <Ns> >> 1 is S_{12} =\nsqrt(<Ns>+<Nb>) - sqrt(<Nb>) in comparison with often used significances S_1 =\n<Ns>/sqrt(<Nb>) and S_2 = <N_s>/sqrt(<Ns> + <Nb>). We propose a method for\ntaking into account the systematical errors related to nonexact knowledge of\nbackground and signal cross sections. An account of such systematics is very\nessential in the search for supersymmetry at LHC. We also propose a method for\nestimation of exclusion limits on new physics in future experiments. \n\n"}
