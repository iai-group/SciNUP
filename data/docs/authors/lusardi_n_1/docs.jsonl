We derive the relevant vacuum polarization functions\nand comment on the functional forms of the Unparticle Uehling potentials for\nvarious scaling dimensions in the point nucleus and finite nucleus\napproximations. It is estimated that for an infra-red fixed point near the\nscale of electroweak symmetry breaking, in the low TeV range, the energy shifts\nin the low-lying muonic lead transitions could typically be of the order of a\nfew times 0.1 eV to a few times 0.01 eV.

Implementing a non-perturbative Wigner-Weisskopf method we obtain\nthe correct \\emph{entangled} quantum state of neutrinos and charged leptons\nfrom the (two-body) decay of a parent particle. The source lifetime and\ndisentanglement length scale lead to a suppression of the oscillation\nprobabilities in short-baseline experiments.

So far a single true TP asymmetry has been\nmeasured in $K_L\\to \\pi^+\\pi^- e^+e^-$. A general discussion is presented for\nT-odd TP asymmetries in four-body decays.

Abstract: Due to the limited statistics so far accumulated in the Higgs boson search at\nthe LHC, the Higgs boson property has not yet been tightly constrained and it\nis still allowed for the Higgs boson to decay invisibly to dark matter with a\nsizable branching ratio. In this work, we examine the Higgs decay to neutralino\ndark matter in low energy SUSY by considering three different models: the\nminimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM), the next-to-minimal\nsupersymmetric standard models (NMSSM) and the nearly minimal supersymmetric\nstandard model (nMSSM).

Then in the allowed parameter space we calculate\nthe branching ratio of the SM-like Higgs decay to neutralino dark matter and\nexamine its observability at the LHC by considering three production channels:\nthe weak boson fusion VV->h, the associated production with a Z-boson pp->hZ+X\nor a pair of top quarks pp->htt_bar+X.

In this paper we\npropose a novel type of dark matter detector: detectors made of DNA or RNA\ncould provide nanometer resolution for tracking, an energy threshold of 0.5\nkeV, and can operate at room temperature.

Thus the path of the\nrecoiling nucleus can be tracked to nanometer accuracy.

The Tevatron and the LHC provide very accurate measurements of many\nStandard Model processes, such as the production of a lepton pair (Drell-Yan)\nof high invariant mass. An accurate theoretical prediction of such processes is\ncrucial to be able to distinguish Standard Model physics from possible new\nphysics signals. QCD effects in the computation of the cross-sections at hadron\ncolliders are usually sizable; in particular, in some kinematical regimes they\nbehave in a non-perturbative way. In these cases the resummation of the whole\nperturbative series is needed for accurate phenomenological predictions.

This symmetry was studied in weak\ninteraction where it is fully violated, but it is poorly known in the strong\nand electromagnetic interactions.\n  To this end, in this thesis we investigated eta->pi+pi-pi0 and eta->pi0 e+e-\ndecays, which might violate charge conjugation symmetry. The violation of C\nsymmetry in eta->pi+pi-pi0 process could manifest itself as an asymmetry\nbetween energy spectra of charged pions. The eta->pi0 e+e- decay is forbidden\nby C symmetry in the first order of electromagnetic interaction, with the\nbranching ratio on a level of 10^-8. Therefore, observation of a larger\nbranching ratio could indicate a mechanism involving first order\nelectromagnetic interaction violating charge conjugation.\n  Both decays were investigated by means of the WASA-at-COSY detector operating\nat the COSY synchrotron at the Forchungszentrum Julich in Germany. The eta\nmeson was produced via pp->pp eta reaction at the proton beam momentum of\n2.14GeV/c. In total around 5x10^7 eta mesons were collected.\n  As a result of the analysis conducted in the framework of this thesis a\nDalitz Plot distribution for the eta->pi+pi-pi0 decay was obtained.

Abstract: Axion-Like Particles (ALPs), if exist in nature, are expected to mix with\nphotons in the presence of an external magnetic field. The energy range of\nphotons which undergo strong mixing with ALPs depends on the ALP mass, on its\ncoupling with photons as well as on the external magnetic field and particle\ndensity configurations. Recent observations of blazars by the Fermi Gamma-Ray\nSpace Telescope in the 0.1-300 GeV energy range show a break in their spectra\nin the 1-10 GeV range. We have modeled this spectral feature for the\nflat-spectrum radio quasar 3C454.3 during its November 2010 outburst, assuming\nthat a significant fraction of the gamma rays convert to ALPs in the large\nscale jet of this blazar. Using theoretically motivated models for the magnetic\nfield and particle density configurations in the kiloparsec scale jet, outside\nthe broad-line region, we find an ALP mass $m_a\\sim (1-3)\\cdot 10^{-7}$ eV and\ncoupling $g_{a\\gamma} \\sim (1-3)\\cdot 10^{-10}$ GeV$^{-1}$ after performing an\nillustrative statistical analysis of spectral data in four different epochs of\nemission. The precise values of $m_a$ and $g_{a\\gamma}$ depend weakly on the\nassumed particle density configuration and are consistent with the current\nexperimental bounds on these quantities. We apply this method and ALP\nparameters found from fitting 3C454.3 data to another flat-spectrum radio\nquasar PKS1222+216 (4C+21.35) data up to 400 GeV, as a consistency check, and\nfound good fit.

We consider scenario where top quark Yukawa and weak gauge\ncoupling unification can be realized and identify the compactification scale as\none at which this two coupling couplings have the same value. Taking into\naccount the experimental uncertainties in measurements of the top quark mass\nand the QCD coupling constant, the Higgs mass prediction of 119-126 GeV from\nthe gauge-Higgs unification scenario is consistent with the experimentally\nmeasured value of 125-126 GeV. More precise measurements of the top quark mass\nand the QCD coupling constant are crucial to reduce the interval of the Higgs\nmass prediction and thereby test the feasibility of the gauge-Higgs unification\nscenario. \n\n"}

In the SM the masses of fermions and the heavy\ngauge bosons are generated by the interactions with the Higgs field, so all\ncouplings are related to the observed masses. Indeed, all observed couplings\nare consistent with the predictions from the Higgs mechanism, both to vector\nbosons and fermions implying that masses are indeed consistent of being\ngenerated by the interactions with the Higgs field. However, on a cosmological\nscale the mass of the universe seems not to be related to the Higgs field: the\nbaryonic mass originates from the binding energy of the quarks inside the\nnuclei and dark matter is not even predicted in the SM, so the origin of its\nmass is unknown. The dominant energy component in the universe, the dark\nenergy, yields an accelerated expansion of the universe, so its repulsive\ngravity most likely originates from a kind of vacuum energy. The Higgs field\nwould be the prime candidate for this, if the energy density would not be many\norders of magnitude too high, as will be calculated.

A narrow resonance of the\ncorrect size could be obtained for a color-triplet scalar with electric charge\n-4/3 and mass near 375 GeV, if (as a recent lattice computation suggests) the\nwave function at the origin is somewhat larger than anticipated. Pair\nproduction of this particle could have evaded detection up to now. Other\ncandidates may include a triplet scalar of charge 5/3, a triplet fermion of\ncharge -4/3, and perhaps a sextet scalar of charge -2/3. \n\n"}

The SM matter and Higgs fields propagate from\nthe UV brane down to this intermediate brane only, while gauge and gravity\nfields propagate in the entire bulk. Such a configuration renders the lightest\ngauge Kaluza-Klein (KK) states within LHC reach, simultaneously satisfying\nflavor and CP constraints. In addition, the usual leading decay modes of the\nlightest KK gauge bosons into top and Higgs bosons are suppressed. This effect\npermits erstwhile subdominant channels to become significant. These include\nflavor-universal decays to SM fermions and Higgs bosons, and a novel channel -\ndecay to a radion and a SM gauge boson, followed by radion decay to a pair of\nSM gauge bosons. In this work, we first delineate the parameter space where the\nabove mentioned cascade decay of gauge KK particles dominates, and thereby can\nbe the discovery mode at the LHC. We then perform a detailed analysis of the\nLHC signals from this model, finding that 300/fb suffices for evidence of\nKK-gluon in tri-jet, jet + di-photon and jet + di-boson channels. However, KK\nphoton in photon + di-jet, and KK-W in leptonic W + di-jet require 3000/fb. The\ncrucial feature of this decay chain is a \"double\" resonance, i.e. 3-particle\nand 2-particle invariant mass peaks, corresponding to the KK gauge boson and\nthe radion respectively. \n\n"}

Despite its utility, it is not\ninfrared and collinear (IRC) safe, so perturbative calculations are limited to\nstudying the energy evolution of multiplicity moments. While IRC-safe\nobservables, like jet mass, are perturbatively calculable, their distributions\noften exhibit Casimir scaling, such that their quark/gluon discrimination power\nis limited by the ratio of quark to gluon color factors. In this paper, we\nintroduce new IRC-safe counting observables whose discrimination performance\nexceeds that of jet mass and approaches that of track multiplicity. The key\nobservation is that track multiplicity is approximately Poisson distributed,\nwith more suppressed tails than the Sudakov peak structure from jet mass. By\nusing an iterated version of the soft drop jet grooming algorithm, we can\ndefine a \"soft drop multiplicity\" which is Poisson distributed at\nleading-logarithmic accuracy. In addition, we calculate the\nnext-to-leading-logarithmic corrections to this Poisson structure. If we allow\nthe soft drop groomer to proceed to the end of the jet branching history, we\ncan define a collinear-unsafe (but still infrared-safe) counting observable.\nExploiting the universality of the collinear limit, we define generalized\nfragmentation functions to study the perturbative energy evolution of\ncollinear-unsafe multiplicity. \n\n"}

While\nmass limits obtained in this manner are highly model dependent, cross section\nupper limits (or efficiency maps) may be used to obtain constraints on generic\nBSM scenarios without any further event and detector simulation. This procedure\nhas been automatised in the public tool SModelS, which first decomposes the\ngeneric scenario into its simplified model components which can then be tested\ndirectly against the experimental constraints in the SModelS database.

In this Letter of\nIntent, we propose to test this hypothesis by setting up a photon regeneration\nexperiment which exploits the photon beam of the Vacuum-UltraViolet\nFree-Electron Laser VUV-FEL, sent along the transverse magnetic field of a\nlinear arrangement of dipole magnets of size B L ~ 30 Tm. The high photon\nenergies available at the VUV-FEL increase substantially the expected photon\nregeneration rate in the mass range implied by the PVLAS anomaly, in comparison\nto the rate expected at visible lasers of similar power. We find that the\nparticle interpretation of the PVLAS result can be tested within a short\nrunning period. The pseudoscalar vs. scalar nature can be determined by varying\nthe direction of the magnetic field with respect to the laser polarization. The\nmass of the particle can be measured by running at different photon energies.\nThe proposed experiment offers a window of opportunity for a firm establishment\nor exclusion of the particle interpretation of the PVLAS anomaly before other\nexperiments can compete. \n\n"}

Abstract: Direct photon production from a quark gluon plasma (QGP) in thermal\nequilibrium is studied directly in real time. In contrast to the usual S-matrix\ncalculations, the real time approach is valid for a QGP that formed and reached\nLTE a short time after a collision and of finite lifetime ($\\sim 10-20\n\\mathrm{fm}/c$ as expected at RHIC or LHC). We point out that during such\nfinite QGP lifetime the spectrum of emitted photons carries information on the\ninitial state. There is an inherent ambiguity in separating the virtual from\nthe observable photons during the transient evolution of the QGP. We propose a\nreal time formulation to extract the photon yield which includes the initial\nstage of formation of the QGP parametrized by an effective time scale of\nformation $\\Gamma^{-1}$. This formulation coincides with the S-matrix approach\nin the infinite lifetime limit. It allows to separate the virtual cloud as well\nas the observable photons emitted during the pre- equilibrium stage from the\nyield during the QGP lifetime. We find that the lowest order contribution\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_{em})$ which does \\emph{not} contribute to the S-matrix\napproach, is of the same order of or larger than the S-matrix contribution\nduring the lifetime of the QGP for a typical formation time $\\sim 1\n\\mathrm{fm}/c$.

The measured\ncross section of $e^+ e^- \\to J/\\psi + \\eta_c$ is much larger than leading\norder (LO) theoretical predictions.

Then\ntwo penguin-free and Cabibbo-dominant modes are proposed: B0(t) -> D+D-K_S with\nthe D_s** resonances, and B0(t) -> D0_CP pi+pi- with the D** plus the rho.\nFinally, the B0(t) -> D+-pi-+K_S channel with the D_s** and K* resonances\nprovides a new clean method to measure the unusual angle 2beta+gamma. We\npresent in all cases a crude estimate of the number of cos(2beta) (respectively\n2beta+gamma) sensitive events. We show that this number is an increasing\nfunction of the resonance mass, a favorable situation compared to the more\nextensively studied three-pion Dalitz plot. However, the poor detection\nefficiency of the D mesons could pose a problem. As an annex and speculative\napplication of these Dalitz plot based methods, the penguin-dominated B0(t) ->\nK_SK_SK_L decay also measures 2beta. \n\n"}

It can be viewed as the low-energy limit\nof a physically relevant fundamental theory with Lorentz-covariant dynamics in\nwhich spontaneous Lorentz violation occurs.
