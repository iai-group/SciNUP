This representation naturally\nextends to the one in terms of the split Cayley hexagon of order two. 63 points\nof the hexagon split into 9 orbits of 7 points (operators) each under the\naction of an automorphism of order 7. 63 lines of the hexagon carry three\npoints each and represent the triples of operators such that the product of any\ntwo gives, up to a sign, the third one. Since this hexagon admits a full\nembedding in a projective 5-space over GF(2), the 35 symmetric operators are\nalso found to answer to the points of a Klein quadric in such space.

Dynamical\ndecoupling (DD) is an effective method for reducing decoherence with a low\ncontrol overhead. It also plays an important role in quantum metrology, where\nfor instance it is employed in multiparameter estimation. While a sequence of\nequidistant control pulses (CPMG) has been ubiquitously used for decoupling,\nUhrig recently proposed that a non-equidistant pulse sequence (UDD) may enhance\nDD performance, especially for systems where the spectral density of the\nenvironment has a sharp frequency cutoff. On the other hand, equidistant\nsequences outperform UDD for soft cutoffs. The relative advantage provided by\nUDD for intermediate regimes is not clear.

These investigations are part of a large research\nprogram on a \"quantum-digitalization\" of physics, with Quantum Theory as a\nspecial theory of information, and Physics as emergent from the same\nquantum-information processing. A QCA-based QFT has tremendous potential\nadvantages compared to QFT, being quantum \"ab-initio\" and free from the\nproblems plaguing QFT due to the continuum hypothesis. Here I will show how\ndynamics emerges from the quantum processing, how the QCA can reproduce the\nDirac-field phenomenology at large scales, and the kind of departures from QFT\nthat that should be expected at a Planck-scale discreteness. I will introduce\nthe notions of linear field quantum automaton and local-matrix quantum\nautomaton, in terms of which I will provide the solution to the Feynman's\nproblem about the possibility of simulating a Fermi field with a quantum\ncomputer. \n\n"}

For pure states, it has been shown that observables can\nalways be constructed such that any state has any amount of entanglement\npossible. For mixed states, the situation is more complex and only partial\nresults are known: while it is always possible to choose a factorization such\nthat a state appears separable, a general criterion to determine whether a\nstate can be represented as entangled is not known. These results will be\nillustrated by several examples, the phenomenon of quantum teleportation, and\nthe geometry of the states of two qubits. \n\n"}

Second, we consider a recent\nsoliton model of the electron, in which the quantum-mechanical wave function is\na phase modulation of a carrier wave. Both models are consistent with one\nanother and with observation. Both models suggest how entanglement and\ndecoherence may be related to device geometry.

Despite of its main role in quantum information processing,\nkinematic non-locality is unable to induce any change in the probability\ndistributions, so that the \"action-at-a-distance\" cannot manifest[5,6].\nConversely, dynamical non-locality does create explicit changes in probability,\nthough in a \"causality-preserving\" manner[6,7].

More precisely, it is of fundamental interest to understand\nhow the storage, manipulation, and transmission of information utilizing\nquantum systems are influenced by the fact that these processes take place in a\nrelativistic spacetime. In particular, many studies in RQI have been focused on\nthe effects of non-uniform motion on entanglement, the main resource of quantum\ninformation protocols. Early investigations in this direction were performed in\nhighly idealized settings that prompted questions as to the practical\naccessibility of these results. To overcome these limitations it is necessary\nto consider quantum systems that are in principle accessible to localized\nobservers. In this thesis we present such a model, the rigid relativistic\ncavity, and its extensions, focusing on the effects of motion on entanglement\nand applications such as quantum teleportation. We study cavities in (1+1)\ndimensions undergoing non-uniform motion, consisting of segments of uniform\nacceleration and inertial motion of arbitrary duration that allow the involved\nvelocities to become relativistic. The transitions between segments can be\nsharp or smooth and higher dimensions can be incorporated. The primary focus\nlies in the Bogoliubov transformations of the quantum fields, real scalar\nfields or Dirac fields, confined to the cavities. The Bogoliubov\ntransformations change the particle content and the occupation of the energy\nlevels of the cavity. We show how these effects generate entanglement between\nthe modes of the quantum fields inside a single cavity for various initial\nstates. The entanglement between several cavities, on the other hand, is\ndegraded by the non-uniform motion, influencing the fidelity of tasks such as\nteleportation. \n\n"}

There, the low energy\nstates of a nonlinear electronic oscillator are isolated and addressed as a\nqubit. These qubits are capacitively coupled to the modes of a\nmicrowave-frequency transmission line resonator which serves as a quantum\ncommunication bus. Microwave electrical pulses are applied to the resonator to\nmanipulate or measure the qubit state. State control is calibrated using\ndiagnostic sequences that expose systematic errors. Hybridization of the\nresonator with the qubit gives it a nonlinear response when driven strongly,\nuseful for amplifying the measurement signal to enhance accuracy. Qubits\ncoupled to the same bus may coherently interact with one another via the\nexchange of virtual photons. A two-qubit conditional phase gate mediated by\nthis interaction can deterministically entangle its targets, and is used to\ngenerate two-qubit Bell states and three-qubit GHZ states.

However\nexperiments on a class of random-bond instances have not yet demonstrated an\nadvantage over classical optimization algorithms on traditional computer\nhardware. Here we present evidence as to why this might be the case. These\nengineered quantum annealing machines effectively operate coupled to a\ndecohering thermal bath.

We simulate both random-bond Ising\nmodels and spin glasses with bimodal and Gaussian disorder on the D-Wave\nChimera topology. Our results show that while the worst-case complexity of\nfinding a ground state of an Ising spin glass on the Chimera graph is not\npolynomial, the finite-temperature phase space is likely rather simple: Spin\nglasses on Chimera have only a zero-temperature transition. This means that\nbenchmarking optimization methods using spin glasses on the Chimera graph might\nnot be the best benchmark problems to test quantum speedup.

Abstract: Macroscopic Realism (MR) says that a macroscopic system is always\ndeterminately in one or other of the macroscopically distinguishable states\navailable to it. The Leggett-Garg (LG) inequality was derived to allow\nexperimental test of whether or not this doctrine is true; it is also often\nthought of as a temporal version of a Bell-inequality. Despite recent interest\nin the inequality, controversy remains regarding what would be shown by its\nviolation. Here we resolve this controversy, which arises due to an\ninsufficiently general and model-independent approach to the question so far.\nWe argue that LG's initial characterisation of MR does not pick out a\nparticularly natural realist position, so we articulate an operationally\nwell-defined and well-motivated position in its place. We show that much weaker\nconditions than LG's are sufficient to derive the inequality: in the first\ninstance, its violation only demonstrates that certain measurements fail to be\nnon-disturbing at the operational level. We articulate three distinct species\nof MR-ist position, and argue that it is only the first of these which can be\nrefuted by LG inequality violation. This first position is an attractive one,\nso ruling it out remains of interest, however. A crucial role is played in LG's\nargument by the assumption of noninvasive measurability. We show that this\nnotion is ambiguous between the weaker notion of disturbance at the operational\nlevel, and the stronger notion of invasiveness at the ontic level of properties\nof the system. Ontic noninvasiveness would be required to rule out MR per se\nbut this property is not entailed by MR, and its presence cannot be established\nin a model-independent way. It follows that despite the formal parallels,\nBell's and LG's inequalities are not methodologically on a par.

In this work, we explore non-Markovianity through the\nbreakdown of monotonicity of a metrological figure of merit, called the quantum\ninterferometric power, which is based on the minimal quantum Fisher information\nobtained by local unitary evolution of one part of the system, and can be\ninterpreted as a quantifier of quantum correlations beyond entanglement.

This clock is infinitely precise and tacitly supplied\nfree of charge from outside physics.

Indeed, contrary to\nour experience, the Wheeler-deWitt equation --a canonical quantization of\ngeneral relativity-- predicts a static universe. Similarly, when simply\nconcerned with the dynamics of a closed quantum system, there is no second law\nbecause the Von Neumann entropy is invariant under unitary transformations.\nHere we are mainly concerned with the latter problem and we show that it can be\nresolved by attributing a minimal amount of resources to the measurement of\ntime.

So far, most works that addressed this problem have used\ncascade realizations.

In this\napproach, the geometry of $I_U$, and not a set of differential evolution\nequations in space-time $\\mathcal M_U$, provides the most primitive description\nof the laws of physics.

The confinement\nof light in such nanostructures imposes an inherent link between the local\npolarization and propagation direction of light.

Taken together, these two effects mean that two photons\ncan \"sense\" each other's presence in an interaction mediated by motion.

In this\nwork we show that by adding a coherent feedback channel to a slow mechanical\nsystem ($\\omega_m < \\kappa$) that is weakly nonlinear ($g_0 < \\kappa$), two\nspatially separated single photons can be made to effectively interact with\neach other deterministically through the mechanical motion of a resonator.

This cross term may be significantly larger than the purely\nquantum part, but also undergoes fluctuations driven by the quantum field. We\nillustrate this effect in a model for lightcone fluctuations involving pulses\nin a nonlinear dielectric. Vacuum electric field fluctuations produce\nfluctuations in the speed of a probe pulse, and form an analog model for\nquantum gravity effects. If the material has a nonzero third-order\nsusceptibility, then the fractional light speed fluctuations are proportional\nto the square of the fluctuating electric field. Hence the application of a\nclassical electric field can enhance the speed fluctuations.

Dynamic evolution is in terms of the path\nparameter rather than the frame-dependent time coordinate. Further, the states\nof the theory are allowed to be off shell.

Here\nwe argue that the formalism of quantum theory can be derived from two related\nintuitive principles: (i) inference is a physical process performed by physical\nsystems, observers, which are part of the experimental setup---this implies\nnon-commutativity and imaginary-time quantum mechanics; (ii) experiments must\nbe described from a first-person perspective---this leads to self-reference,\ncomplementarity, and real-time quantum dynamics. This approach sheds new light\non the foundations of quantum theory and suggests fundamental equations in\nphysics are typically of second order due to the physical nature of the\nobserver. It also suggests some experimental conjectures: (i) the quantum of\naction could be understood as the result of the additional energy required to\ntransition from unconscious to conscious perception; (ii) humans can observe a\nsingle photon of visible light; (iii) self-aware systems and the neural\ncorrelates of the self should be composed of two complementary sub-systems,\nmuch like the DNA molecule is composed of two strands---this may help explain\nthe double-hemisphere architecture of the brain.

We begin by reviewing the Unruh-DeWitt detector and its\ninteraction with a real scalar field in the vacuum state, as well as the\nentanglement harvesting protocol in general.

The ability to achieve $p_s > 0.5$ has been found to be\ncritical in resource-efficient realizations of linear optical quantum computing\nand all-photonic quantum repeaters. Yet, the aforesaid value of $p_s > 0.5$ is\nnot known to be the maximum achievable using squeezing, thereby leaving it open\nwhether close-to-$100\\%$ efficient BSM might be achievable using squeezing as a\nresource. In this paper, we report new insights on why squeezing-enhanced BSM\nachieves $p_s > 0.5$. Using this, we show that the previously-reported ${p_s\n\\approx 0.643}$ at single-mode squeezing strength $r=0.6585$---for unambiguous\nstate discrimination (USD) of all four Bell states---is an experimentally\nunachievable point result, which drops to $p_s \\approx 0.59$ with the slightest\nchange in $r$.

Finally, deviating from USD operation, we explore a\ntrade-space between $p_s$, the probability with which the BSM circuit declares\na \"success\", versus the probability of error $p_e$, the probability of an input\nBell state being erroneously identified given the circuit declares a success.\nSince quantum error correction could correct for some $p_e > 0$, this tradeoff\nmay enable better quantum repeater designs by potentially increasing the\nentanglement generation rates with $p_s$ exceeding what is possible with\ntraditionally-studied USD operation of BSMs. \n\n"}

So far, physical properties of gl(1|DN) WQOs were\ndescribed only in the so-called Fock spaces W(p), leading to interesting\nconcepts such as non-commutative coordinates and a discrete spatial structure.\nHere, we describe physical properties of WQOs for other unitary\nrepresentations, including certain representations V(p) of gl(1|DN). These new\nsolutions again have remarkable properties following from the spectrum of the\nHamiltonian and of the position, momentum, and angular momentum operators.\nFormulae are obtained that give the angular momentum content of all the\nrepresentations V(p) of gl(1|3N), associated with the N-particle 3-dimensional\nWQO. For these representations V(p) we also consider in more detail the\nspectrum of the position operators and their squares, leading to interesting\nconsequences. In particular, a classical limit of these solutions is obtained,\nthat is in agreement with the correspondence principle. \n\n"}

The motivation comes from a desire\nto address certain deep issues that arise when contemplating quantum theories\nof space and time. Our basic contention is that constructing a theory of\nphysics is equivalent to finding a representation in a topos of a certain\nformal language that is attached to the system. Classical physics arises when\nthe topos is the category of sets. Other types of theory employ a different\ntopos. In this paper, we study in depth the topos representation of the\npropositional language, PL(S), for the case of quantum theory. In doing so, we\nmake a direct link with, and clarify, the earlier work on applying topos theory\nto quantum physics. The key step is a process we term `daseinisation' by which\na projection operator is mapped to a sub-object of the spectral presheaf--the\ntopos quantum analogue of a classical state space.

Records may\nstill exist but are necessarily imperfect. We formulate an\ninformation-theoretic conjecture about decoherence due to an environment: the\nnumber of bits required to describe a set of decoherent histories is\napproximately equal to the number of bits of information thrown away to the\nenvironment in the coarse-graining process. This idea is verified in a simple\nmodel consisting of a particle coupled to an environment that can store only\none bit of information.

A `hybrid' quantum-classical density is introduced and\nits evolution equation derived. The implications and applications of our result\nare numerous: it incorporates the back-reaction of quantum on classical\nvariables, it resolves fundamental problems encountered in standard mean field\ntheories, and remarkably, also the quantum measurement process, i.e. the most\ncontroversial example of quantum-classical interaction is consistently\ndescribed within our approach, leading to a theory of dynamical collapse. \n\n"}

The measuring process Abstract: The measuring process is an external intervention in the dynamics of a\nquantum system.

States and ensembles Abstract: In this sequence of papers, noncommutative analysis is used to give a\nconsistent axiomatic approach to a unified conceptual foundation of classical\nand quantum physics.\n  The present Part I defines the concepts of observables, states and ensembles,\nclarifies the logical relations and operations for them, and shows how they\ngive rise to dynamics and probabilities.\n  States are identified with maximal consistent sets of weak equalities in the\nalgebra of observables (instead of, as usual, with the rays in a Hilbert\nspace). This leads to a concise foundation of quantum mechanics, free of\nundefined terms, separating in a clear way the deterministic and the stochastic\nfeatures of quantum physics.\n  The traditional postulates of quantum mechanics are derived from\nwell-motivated axiomatic assumptions. No special quantum logic is needed to\nhandle the peculiarities of quantum mechanics. Foundational problems associated\nwith the measurement process, such as the reduction of the state vector,\ndisappear.\n  The new interpretation of quantum mechanics contains `elements of physical\nreality' without the need to introduce a classical framework with hidden\nvariables. In particular, one may talk about the state of the universe without\nthe need of an external observer and without the need to assume the existence\nof multiple universes. \n\n"}
