In this paper, we consider the Berry phase\ncontribution in the absence of superflow, which results in branch cuts between\nneighboring vortices across which the quasiparticle wave function changes sign.\nHere, the simplest problem that captures the physics is that of scattering from\na single finite branch cut that stretches between two vortices. Elliptical\ncoordinates are natural for this two-center problem, and we proceed by\nseparating the massless Dirac equation in elliptical coordinates. The separated\nequations take the form of the Whittaker-Hill equations, which we solve to\nobtain radial and angular eigenfunctions. With these eigenfunctions in hand, we\nconstruct the scattering cross section via partial wave analysis. We discuss\nthe scattering effect of Berry phase in the absence of superflow, having\nconsidered the superflow effect in the absence of Berry phase in a separate\npaper. We also provide qualitative comparison of transport cross sections for\nthe Berry phase and the Superflow effects. The important issue of interference\nbetween the two effects is left to future work. \n\n"}

The objective is to\nprovide a modern account of the nuclear EDF formalism that is at variance with\ntraditional presentations that rely, at one point or another, on a {\\it\nHamiltonian-based} picture. The latter is not general enough to encompass what\nthe nuclear EDF method represents as of today.

Coherent representations are nevertheless of fundamental importance\nbecause incoherent ones can always be expressed as a linear superposition of\ncoherent elements. This property is exploited to derive general expressions for\nthe pricing kernel and the associated bond price and short rate processes in\nthe case of an n-th order chaos model for each $n$. The pricing formulae for\nbond options and swaptions are obtained in closed forms for a number of\nexamples. An explicit representation for the pricing kernel of a\ngeneric---incoherent---model is then obtained by use of the underlying coherent\nelements. Finally, finite-dimensional realisations of the coherent chaos models\nare investigated in detail. In particular, it is shown that a class of highly\ntractable models can be constructed having the characteristic feature that the\ndiscount bond price is given by a piecewise flat (simple) process. \n\n"}

This question is motivated by\nearlier work of A. M. Essin and one of us (M.

This approach does not produce a physical model for each\nsymmetry class, and indeed there are reasons to believe that some symmetry\nclasses may not be realizable in strictly two-dimensional systems, thus raising\nthe question of which classes are in fact possible. While our understanding is\nlimited to a restricted class of models, it is complete in the sense that for\neach of the 2080 possible symmetry classes, we either prove rigorously that the\nclass cannot be realized in our family of models, or we give an explicit model\nrealizing the class.

The goal of this article is to provide\na unified view on both approaches. This is achieved by studying reduced-form\napproaches under weak assumptions.

The financial crisis indicators that we have built deal\nwith the spectral properties of these covariance and correlation matrices and\nthey are of two kinds. The first one is based on the Hellinger distance,\ncomputed between the distribution of the eigenvalues of the empirical\ncovariance matrix and the distribution of the eigenvalues of a reference\ncovariance matrix representing either a calm or agitated market. The idea\nbehind this first type of indicators is that when the empirical distribution of\nthe spectrum of the covariance matrix is deviating from the reference in the\nsense of Hellinger, then a crisis may be forthcoming.

In\nparticular, we show that an effective mass that varies with the flavor index as\nwell as a running band edge and lifetime capture the AC and DC transport\nphenomenology of the cuprates. A key consequence of the running mass is that\nthe effective dynamical exponent can differ from the underlying bare critical\nexponent, thereby providing a mechanism for realizing the fractional values of\nthe dynamical exponent required in a previous analysis\\cite{ Hartnoll:2015sea}.\nWe also predict that regardless of the bare dynamical exponent, $z$, a non-zero\nanomalous dimension for the current is required.

From this result we argue the existence of a non-equilibrium\nquantum phase transition with a critical phase $|\\Delta|\\leqslant1$. From the\nnon-superextensivity of the Fisher information of reduced states, we infer that\nthis non-equilibrium quantum phase transition does not have local order\nparameters but has non-local ones, at least at $|\\Delta|=1$. In the\nnon-perturbative regime for the noise strength, we numerically computed the\nreduced Fisher information which lower bounds the full state Fisher\ninformation, and is superextensive only at $|\\Delta|=1$. Form the latter\nresult, we derived local order parameters at $|\\Delta|=1$ in the\nnon-perturbative case. The existence of critical behaviour witnessed by the\nFisher information in the phase $|\\Delta|<1$ is still an open problem. The\nFisher information also represents the best sensitivity for any estimation of\nthe control parameter, in our case the anisotropy $\\Delta$, and its\nsuperextensivity implies enhanced estimation precision which is also highly\nrobust in the presence of a critical phase. \n\n"}

Near the\ncritical region at $x_{\\rm{cr}}$ $\\approx$ 0.7, the rate of contraction of the\nunit cell volume strengthens, indicating that the cerium $f$-valence crosses\nover from trivalent to a non-integer value. Consistent with this picture, x-ray\nabsorption spectroscopy measurements reveal that while CePd$_2$P$_2$ has a\npurely trivalent cerium $f$-state, CeNi$_2$P$_2$ has a small ($<$ 10 \\%)\ntetravalent contribution.

These diffusions\nrepresent the distances-to-default of financial institutions and absorption at\nzero corresponds to default. As a way of modelling correlated exposures and\nherd behaviour, we consider a common source of noise and a form of\nmean-reversion in the drift. Moreover, we introduce an endogenous contagion\nmechanism whereby the default of one institution can cause a drop in the\ndistances-to-default of the other institutions.

First,\nwe show that by appropriately screening the one- and two-electron integrals of\nthe Hamiltonian one can improve the efficiency of the algorithm by several\norders of magnitude. This improved efficiency comes with the added benefit that\nthe resulting algorithm scales as the second power of the system size $O(N^2)$,\ndown from the fourth power $O(N^4)$. Using numerical results, we demonstrate\nthat the practical scaling obtained is in fact $O(N^{1.5})$ for a chain of\nHydrogen atoms, and $O(N^{1.2})$ for the Hubbard model. Second, we introduce\nthe use of the rejection-free continuous time Monte Carlo (CTMC) to sample the\ndeterminants. CTMC is usually prohibitively expensive because of the need to\ncalculate a large number of intermediates. Here, we take advantage of the fact\nthat these intermediates are already calculated during the evaluation of the\nlocal energy and consequently, just by storing them one can use the CTCM\nalgorithm with virtually no overhead. Third, we show that by using the adaptive\nstochastic gradient descent algorithm called AMSGrad one can optimize the\nwavefunction energies robustly and efficiently. The combination of these three\nimprovements allows us to calculate the ground state energy of a chain of 160\nhydrogen atoms using a wavefunction containing $\\sim 2\\times 10^5$ variational\nparameters with an accuracy of 1 $mE_h$/particle at a cost of just 25 CPU\nhours, which when split over 2 nodes of 24 processors each amounts to only\nabout half hour of wall time.

We\nbegin by constructing a toy model of Bell pair dynamics which demonstrates that\nmeasurements can keep a system in a state of low (i.e. area law) entanglement,\nin contrast with the volume law entanglement produced by generic pure unitary\ntime evolution. While the simplest Bell pair model has area law entanglement\nfor any measurement rate, as seen in certain non-interacting systems, we show\nthat more generic models of entanglement can feature an area-to-volume law\ntransition at a critical value of the measurement rate, in agreement with\nrecent numerical investigations. As a concrete example of these ideas, we\nanalytically investigate Clifford evolution in qubit systems which can exhibit\nan entanglement transition. We are able to identify stabilizer size\ndistributions characterizing the area law, volume law and critical 'fixed\npoints.'

Carr in 2008, and then further elaborated on by Carr\nand Nadtochiy, 2017 (CN2017), and Carr and Itkin, 2018 (CI2018). As compared\nwith the latest version of the model developed in CI2018 and called the ELVG\n(the Expanded Local Variance Gamma model), here we provide two innovations.\nFirst, in all previous papers the model was constructed based on a Gamma\ntime-changed {\\it arithmetic} Brownian motion: with no drift in CI2017, and\nwith drift in CI2018, and the local variance to be a function of the spot level\nonly. In contrast, here we develop a {\\it geometric} version of this model with\ndrift. Second, in CN2017 the model was calibrated to option smiles assuming the\nlocal variance is a piecewise constant function of strike, while in CI2018 the\nlocal variance is a piecewise linear} function of strike. In this paper we\nconsider 3 piecewise linear models: the local variance as a function of strike,\nthe local variance as function of log-strike, and the local volatility as a\nfunction of strike (so, the local variance is a piecewise quadratic function of\nstrike). We show that for all these new constructions it is still possible to\nderive an ordinary differential equation for the option price, which plays a\nrole of Dupire's equation for the standard local volatility model, and,\nmoreover, it can be solved in closed form. Finally, similar to CI2018, we show\nthat given multiple smiles the whole local variance/volatility surface can be\nrecovered which does not require solving any optimization problem. Instead, it\ncan be done term-by-term by solving a system of non-linear algebraic equations\nfor each maturity which is fast. \n\n"}

Using fully quantum many-body\ntreatment, where an electron injected as spin-polarized wave packet interacts\nwith local spins comprising the anisotropic quantum Heisenberg ferromagnetic\nchain, we define quantum STT as any time evolution of local spins due to\ninitial many-body state not being an eigenstate of electron+local-spins system.\nFor time evolution caused by injected spin-down electron scattering off local\nup-spins, entanglement between electron subsystem and local spins subsystem\ntakes place leading to decoherence and, therefore, shrinking of the total\nmagnetization but without rotation from its initial orientation which explains\nthe experiments. Furthermore, the same processes---entanglement and thereby\ninduced decoherence---are present also in standard noncollinear geometry,\ntogether with the usual magnetization rotation. This is because STT in quantum\nmany-body picture is caused only by electron spin-down factor state, and the\nonly difference between collinear and noncollinear geometries is in relative\nsize of the contribution of initial many-body state containing such factor\nstate to superpositions of separable many-body quantum states generated during\ntime evolution. \n\n"}

Because the charge gap\narises from on-site correlations, we implement a non-perturbative approach\nwhich incorporates local physics. Crucial to this method is a self-consistent\ntwo-site dynamical cluster expansion which builds in the nearest-neighbour\nenergy scale, $J$.\n  At half-filling, we find that the spectral function possesses a gap of order\n$U$ and is devoid of any coherent quasi-particle peaks. In the doped case, we\nfind that the Fermi surface exceeds the Luttinger volume. Additionally in the\nunderdoped regime, we find that a pseudogap opens in the single particle\ndensity of states.The pseudogap closes above optimal doping and hence our\nproposal is not inconsistent with that of Loram.
