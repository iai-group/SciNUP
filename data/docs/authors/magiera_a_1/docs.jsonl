We first compute the two\nand three hadron production cross sections in mid-rapidity proton-proton\ncollisions. Then we consider Au + Au collisions including parton energy loss\nusing the modified fragmentation function approach. By examining the\ngeometrical paths the hard partons follow through the medium, we show that the\ntwo away-side partons produced in two-to-three processes have in average a\nsmaller and a greater path length than the average path length of the away-side\nparton in two-to-two processes. Therefore there is a large probability that in\nthe former processes one of the particles escapes while the other gets\nabsorbed. This effect leads to an enhancement in the azimuthal correlations of\nthe two-to-three with respect to the two-to-two parton-processes when comparing\nto the same processes in proton-proton collisions since in average the particle\nwith the shortest path length looses less energy with respect to the away side\nparticle in two-to-two processes.

Methods: We calculate the neutrino flux from $\\beta$\nprocesses using nuclear statistical equilibrium abundances convoluted with\napproximate neutrino spectra of the individual nuclei and the thermal neutrino\nspectrum (pair+plasma). Results: Although the two considered thermonuclear\nsupernova explosion scenarios are expected to produce almost identical\nelectromagnetic output, their neutrino signatures appear vastly different,\nwhich allow an unambiguous identification of the explosion mechanism: a pure\ndeflagration produces a single peak in the neutrino light curve, while the\naddition of the second maximum characterizes a delayed-detonation. We\nidentified the following main contributors to the neutrino signal: (1) weak\nelectron neutrino emission from electron captures (in particular on the protons\nCo55 and Ni56) and numerous beta-active nuclei produced by the thermonuclear\nflame and/or detonation front, (2) electron antineutrinos from positron\ncaptures on neutrons, and (3) the thermal emission from pair annihilation.

Of the many possibilities, three experiments are\ndescribed here that are clearly feasible and of high scientific importance.\nFirst, a direct measurement of the saturation scale is possible using the\nbroadening of the transverse momentum distribution of hadrons produced in\nsemi-inclusive DIS. This connection to saturation physics will provide a\nquantitative measure of the degree to which this fundamental QCD phenomenon is\noccurring, and has important consequences in other high-energy scattering\nstudies. Second, the measurement of quark energy loss is feasible, either as a\ndirect measurement at a lower-energy EIC, or as an indirect measurement using\nhadron attenuation at higher energies. Such a measurement will offer the first\nexperimental validation of the energy independence of this process, which is a\nconsequence of the QCD analog of the LPM effect in QED. The third experiment is\nto determine the mechanisms of hadronization using the nucleus as a spatial\nanalyzer, intercomparing hadron attenuation for nuclei of a range of sizes. The\nextended reach of the EIC in energy will allow probes of these mechanisms in\nthe crucial high-z region for the heaviest nuclei, and will permit study of\nhadronization in heavy quark meson and baryon systems. \n\n"}

The decays can be classified according to the\ntype of the anomaly (triangle or box) that governs the corresponding amplitude\nwhen it is extrapolated to the chiral point. In order to take the momentum\ndependencies of the form factors into account, the actual calculations are\nperformed in the frame work of vector meson dominance (VMD) models, namely in\nterms of the original hidden gauge model and modern generalized models. The\nresults of the triangle-anomaly sector show that the hidden gauge model and the\nmodern modifications can describe the data equally well.

This is because smaller nuclei can be measured at\nhigher momentum transfers where the parity violating asymmetry $A_{pv}$ is\nlarger. Also in general, the more neutron rich the isotope, the easier the\nmeasurement, because neutron rich isotopes have larger weak charges and larger\n$A_{pv}$.

Since the\nstudy is mainly on the hadronization of partons at late time, the fluid picture\nis not used to trace the evolution of the system. The inclusive distributions\nat low $p_T$ are determined as the recombination products of thermal partons.\nThe $p_T$ dependencies of both pion and proton have a common exponential factor\napart from other dissimilar kinematic and resonance factors, because they are\ninherited from the same pool of thermal partons. Instead of the usual\ndescription based on hydrodynamics, the azimuthal anisotropy of the produced\nhadrons is explained as the consequence of the effects of minijets, either\nindirectly through the recombination of enhanced thermal partons in the\nvicinity of the trajectories of the semihard partons, or directly through\nthermal-shower recombination.

First,\nwe analyze the data used to claim the observation of neutrinoless double beta\ndecay in Ge-76, and find strong evidence (according to Jeffrey's scale) for a\npeak in the spectrum and moderate evidence for that the peak is actually close\nto the energy expected for the neutrinoless decay.

Then, we statistically test the consistency between\nthis claim with that of recent measurements using Xe-136.

For the analysis we employ three different transport models - the\nmicroscopic off-shell Hadron-String-Dynamics (HSD) transport approach, the\nIsospin Quantum Molecular Dynamics (IQMD) approach as well as the\nUltra-relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD) approach. We confirm the\nexperimentally observed enhancement of the dilepton yield (normalized to the\nmultiplicity of neutral pions $N_{\\pi^0}$) in heavy-ion collisions with respect\nto that measured in $NN = (pp+pn)/2$ collisions. We identify two contributions\nto this enhancement: a) the $pN$ bremsstrahlung which scales with the number of\ncollisions and not with the number of participants, i.e. pions; b) the dilepton\nemission from intermediate $\\Delta$'s which are part of the reaction cycles\n$\\Delta \\to \\pi N ; \\pi N \\to \\Delta$ and $NN\\to N\\Delta; N\\Delta \\to NN$.

Here, we demonstrate that the independent neutrino data\nsets from NuTeV, CHORUS and CDHSW collaborations differ in the absolute overall\nnormalization and that it is not possible to accurately reproduce all the data\nsimultaneously with a single set of PDFs. Our strategy to overcome this\ndifficulty and allow a consistent use of all neutrino data in global PDF\nanalyses is to normalize the data by the integrated cross-sections thereby\ncancelling possible inaccuracies in the absolute normalization. Indeed, this\nbrings all data to a surprisingly good mutual agreement underscoring the\nx-dependence of the nuclear modifications in a model-independent way. The\nconsistency of these data with the present nuclear PDFs is verified by\nintroducing a method to test the effect of a new data set in an existing global\nfit that performed a Hessian error analysis. \n\n"}

We first outline how the\nmedium effects in the electromagnetic spectral function, which governs thermal\nproduction rates, relate to the (partial) restoration of chiral symmetry. In\nparticular, we show how chiral and QCD sum rules, together with constraints\nfrom lattice QCD, can render these relations quantitative. Turning to dilepton\ndata, we elaborate on updates in the space-time evolution and quark-gluon\nplasma emission rates from lattice-QCD calculations. With a now available\nexcitation function in dilepton spectra from the RHIC beam-energy scan\nconnecting down to SPS energies, we argue that a consistent interpretation of\ndilepton data emerges. Combining well-constrained space-time evolutions with\nstate-of-the-art emission rates identifies most of the radiation to emanate\nfrom around the pseudo-critical temperature, and thus confirms resonance\nmelting as the prevalent mechanism in this regime, compatible with chiral\nrestoration. Recent measurements of a relatively soft slope and large elliptic\nflow in direct-photon spectra at RHIC and LHC lend further support to this\npicture. \n\n"}

His fate has never been fully resolved and several articles\nhave been written that explore the mystery itself. His demise intrigues us\nstill today because of his seminal work, published the previous year, that\nestablished symmetric solutions to the Dirac equation that describe a fermionic\nparticle that is its own anti-particle. This work has long had a significant\nimpact in neutrino physics, where this fundamental question regarding the\nparticle remains unanswered. But the formalism he developed has found many uses\nas there are now a number of candidate spin-1/2 neutral particles that may be\ntruly neutral with no quantum number to distinguish them from their\nanti-particles. If such particles exist, they will influence many areas of\nnuclear and particle physics. Most notably the process of neutrinoless double\nbeta decay can only exist if neutrinos are massive Majorana particles. Hence,\nmany efforts to search for this process are underway. Majorana's influence\ndoesn't stop with particle physics, however, even though that was his original\nconsideration. The equations he derived also arise in solid state physics where\nthey describe electronic states in materials with superconducting order. Of\nspecial interest here is the class of solutions of the Majorana equation in one\nand two spatial dimensions at exactly zero energy. These Majorana zero modes\nare endowed with some remarkable physical properties that may lead to advances\nin quantum computing and, in fact, there is evidence that they have been\nexperimentally observed. This review first summarizes the basics of Majorana's\ntheory and its implications.

The prediction of this framework are\ncompared with experimental results from the SPS, RHIC and LHC for $pp$ and AA\ncollisions.\n  Rapidity distributions, probability distributions of transverse momentum and\nmultiplicities, Bose-Einstein correlations, elliptic flow and ridge structures\nare used to evaluate these comparison. The thermodynamical quantities, the\ntemperature, and energy density derived from RHIC and LHC data and Color String\nPercolation Model (CSPM) are used to obtain the shear viscosity to entropy\ndensity ratio ($\\eta/s$). It was observed that the inverse of ($\\eta/s$)\nrepresents the trace anomaly $\\Delta =(\\varepsilon-3P)/T^{4}$. Thus the\npercolation approach within CSPM can be successfully used to describe the\ninitial stages in high energy heavy ion collisions in the soft region in high\nenergy heavy ion collisions. The thermodynamical quantities, temperature and\nthe equation of state are in agreement with the lattice QCD calculations. Thus\nthe clustering of color sources has a clear physical basis although it cannot\nbe deduced directly from QCD. \n\n"}

The relatively large masses of heavy\nquarks ensure that they are predominantly produced in the early stages of the\ncollision and probe the complete space-time evolution of the expanding medium.\nThe measurements of D-meson production in pp collisions provide an important\ntest of pQCD calculations and serve as an essential baseline for the\ncomprehensive studies in heavy-ion collisions. The study of D-meson production\nin p-Pb collisions is necessary to disentangle the cold nuclear matter effects\nfrom hot nuclear matter effects. The measurement of heavy-flavour production as\na function of charged-particle multiplicity in pp and p-Pb collisions could\nprovide insight into the role of multi-parton interactions at LHC energies.\n  We present ALICE results on D-meson production in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}\n=$ 7 TeV and p-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm {NN}}}=$ 5.02 TeV. The D-meson\nyields per event, measured in different multiplicity intervals and normalized\nto their multiplicity-integrated values, are presented for pp and p-Pb\ncollisions.

Due to their heavy mass, charm quarks are expected to\nthermalize much more slowly than light flavor quarks. The charm quark flow is a\nunique tool to study the extent of thermalization of the bulk medium dominated\nby light quarks and gluons. At high $p_T$, D meson azimuthal anisotropy is\nsensitive to the path length dependence of charm quark energy loss in the\nmedium, which offers new insights into heavy quark energy loss mechanisms -\ngluon radiation vs. collisional processes.

In this paper, we consider models with a $750$ GeV\nscalar and vector-like particles, which couple each other through Yukawa\ncouplings. The diphoton decay of the scalar is enhanced by the loop diagrams\ninvolving the extra colored particles. We investigate not only the setup\nrequired by the excesses, but also the LHC constraints, especially concerned\nwith the vector-like particles. We consider the scenario that the extra colored\nparticles decay to quarks and a dark matter (DM) via Yukawa couplings. Then,\nthe signals from the vector-like particles are dijet, $b\\overline{b}$ and/or\n$t\\overline{t}$ with large missing energy.

To this end, we introduce a stochastic model of the residual magnetic\nfield within the propagation region which draws on features of magnetic\nprofiles measured during the last free neutron oscillation experiment\n[conducted at the Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL) in the 1990's].

As\nregards the large spikes in the magnetic field which can be expected at, for\nexample, joints in the magnetic shielding of the propagation region (despite\ncompensating currents and magnetic idealization of the shield), we demonstrate\nthat their effect scales as $l/D^{3/2}$, where $D$ is the diameter of the\ncylindrical magnetic shielding.

The calorimetric measurement\neliminates systematic uncertainties arising from the use of external beta\nsources, as in experiments with spectrometers. This measurement was proposed in\n1982 by A.

These factorization breaking effects arise from soft color\nexchanges between charm-anticharm pairs undergoing hadronization and comoving\npartons that are long-lived on time scales of quarkonium formation. We compute\nthe short distance pair production of heavy quarks in the Color Glass\nCondensate (CGC) effective field theory and employ an improved Color\nEvaporation model (ICEM) to describe their hadronization into quarkonium at\nlarge distances.

In an expansion in\npowers of $1/(N_c^2-1)$ and to leading order in the number of sources $N$, we\ncalculate interference effects in the $m$-particle spectra and we determine\nfrom them the second and fourth order cumulant momentum anisotropies $v_n$.\nWithout invoking any azimuthal asymmetry and any density dependent non-linear\ndynamics in the incoming state, and without invoking any interaction in the\nfinal state, we find that QCD interference alone can give rise to values for\n$v_n\\lbrace 2\\rbrace$ and $v_n\\lbrace 4\\rbrace$, $n$ even, that persist\nunattenuated for increasing number of sources, that may increase with\nincreasing multiplicity and that agree with measurements in proton-proton (pp)\ncollisions in terms of the order of magnitude of the signal and the approximate\nshape of the transverse momentum dependence.

Experiments using unpolarized\nbeams and Rosenbluth separation to determine the form factors have found values\nof the ratio approximately consistent with unity over a wide range of $Q^2$,\nwhile polarization transfer experiments suggest that the ratio decreases as a\nfunction of $Q^2$. The most widely-accepted hypothesis to explain this\ndiscrepancy is that hard two-photon exchange (TPE) significantly contributes to\nthe elastic $ep$ cross section. Hard TPE has been neglected in previous\nanalyses of electron-proton scattering scattering experiments, in part due to\nthe fact that there exists no model independent way to calculate the\ncontribution. The effect of hard TPE may be measured experimentally, however,\nvia precise determination of the ratio of the electron-proton and\npositron-proton elastic cross sections.

But as\nexperimental data never reach that limit, numerous methods for making the\nextraction have been proposed, though often the functions are determined after\nseeing the data which can lead to confirmation bias. To find functional forms\nthat will allow for a robust extraction of the input radius for a wide variety\nof functional forms in order to have confidence in the extraction from upcoming\nlow $Q^2$ experimental data such as the Jefferson Lab PRad experiment, we\ncreate a general framework for inputting form-factor functions as well as\nvarious fitting functions. The input form factors are used to generate\npseudo-data with fluctuations intended to mimic the binning and random\nuncertainty of a given set of real data. All combinations of input functions\nand fit functions can then be tested repeatedly against regenerated\npseudo-data.

In this strategy, jets in\nheavy-ion collisions ordered by $p_T$ are viewed as modified versions of the\nsame number of highest-energy jets in proton-proton collisions, and the\nfractional energy loss as a function of jet $p_T$ is a natural observable\n($Q_{\\rm AA}$). Furthermore, despite non-monotonic fluctuations in the energy\nloss, we use an event generator to validate the strong correlation between the\n$p_T$ of the parton that initiates a heavy-ion jet and the $p_T$ of the vacuum\njet which corresponds to it via the quantile procedure ($p_T^{\\rm quant}$). We\ndemonstrate that this strategy both provides a complementary way to study jet\nmodification and mitigates the effect of $p_T$ migration in heavy-ion\ncollisions. \n\n"}

Using a Monte Carlo study, we show that a simpler\nregression model can in certain cases be the better predictive model. This is\nespecially true with noisy data where the complex model will fit the noise\ninstead of the physical signal. Thus, in order to select the appropriate\nregression model to employ, a clear technique should be used such as the Akaike\ninformation criterion or Bayesian information criterion, and ideally selected\nprevious to seeing the results. Also, to ensure a reasonable fit, the scientist\nshould also make regression quality plots, such as residual plots, and not just\nrely on a single criterion such as reduced chi2.

This historic detection has been instrumental\nin providing constraints on the tidal polarizability of neutron stars. In turn,\nthe tidal polarizability has been used to impose limits on stellar radii and\nultimately on the equation of state (EOS). The tidal polarizability is also\nsensitive to the second tidal Love number k2. It is the main purpose of this\nwork to perform a detailed study of k2 which, for a given compactness\nparameter, encodes the entire sensitivity of the tidal polarizability to the\nEOS. In particular, we examine the role that the crustal component of the EOS\nplays in the determination of k2. A set of realistic models of the equation of\nstate that yield an accurate description of the properties of finite nuclei and\nsupport neutron stars of two solar masses is used. Given that the tidal\npolarizability scales as the fifth power of the compactness parameter, a\nuniversal relation exists among the tidal polarizability and the compactness\nparameter that is highly insensitive to the underlying EOS. Thus, besides an\nextraction of the tidal polarizabilities, a measurement of the individual\nstellar masses is also required to impact the mass-radius relation. However, we\nobserve a strong sensitivity of k2 to the EOS, particularly to the contribution\nfrom the inner crust.

Some examples\nare strongly interacting medium and heavy mass atomic nuclei and mesoscopic\ncondensed matter systems. In this approach, the linear Schrodinger equation for\nthe exact many-body wave function is mapped onto a non-linear density-dependent\none-body potential problem. This approximation, not only provides\ncomputationally very simple solutions even for systems with many particles, but\ndue to the non-linearity, it also allows for obtaining solutions that break\nessential symmetries of the system, often connected with phase transitions. In\nthis way, additional correlations are subsumed in the system. However, the\nmean-field approach suffers from the drawback that the corresponding wave\nfunctions do not have sharp quantum numbers and, therefore, many results cannot\nbe compared directly with experimental data. In this article, we discuss\ngeneral group-theory techniques to restore the broken symmetries, and provide\ndetailed expressions on the restoration of translational, rotational, spin,\nisospin, parity and gauge symmetries, where the latter corresponds to the\nrestoration of the particle number.

It turned out that only $N_t$=6,8 and 10 can be\nused for a controlled extrapolation, $N_t$=4 is out of the scaling region.\nSince the QCD transition is a non-singular cross-over there is no unique $T_c$.\nThus, different observables lead to different numerical $T_c$ values even in\nthe continuum and thermodynamic limit.

Upon the proper identification of the uncut and cut pomeron\nexchanges, the topological cross sections for dijet production follow in a\nstraightforward way from the earlier derived nonlinear k_t - factorization\nquadratures for the inclusive dijet cross sections. The concept of a coherent\n(collective) nuclear glue proves extremely useful for the formulation of\nreggeon field theory vertices of multipomeron - cut and uncut - couplings to\nparticles and between themselves. A departure of our unitarity cutting rules\nfrom the ones suggested by the pre-QCD Abramovsky-Kancheli-Gribov rules, stems\nfrom the coupled-channel features of intranuclear pQCD. We propose a\nmultiplicity re-summation as a tool for the isolation of topological cross\nsections for single-jet production. \n\n"}

Abstract: Several experiments have extracted proton electromagnetic form factors from\nelastic cross section measurements using the Rosenbluth technique.

This discrepancy indicates a fundamental problem in one of the\ntwo techniques, or a significant error in polarization transfer or cross\nsection measurements.

The possibility of determining simultaneously the in-medium\nNN cross sections and the symmetry energy was also studied. The proton\ntransverse flow, or even better the combined transverse flow of neutrons and\nprotons, can be used as a probe of the in-medium NN cross sections without much\nhindrance from the uncertainties of the symmetry energy. \n\n"}

In the quark-meson coupling (QMC) model the nuclear correction to the\nsigma term is small and negative, i.e., it decelerates the decrease of the\nquark condensate in nuclear matter. However, the quark condensate in nuclear\nmatter is controlled primarily by the scalar-isoscalar $\\sigma$ field. Compared\nto the leading term, it moderates the decrease more than that of the nuclear\nsigma term alone at densities around and larger than the normal nuclear matter\ndensity. \n\n"}

First applications to medium-mass atomic nuclei Abstract: A new analysis method to investigate halos in finite many-fermion systems is\ndesigned, as existing characterization methods are proven to be\nincomplete/inaccurate. A decomposition of the internal wave-function of the\n{$N$-body} system in terms of overlap functions allows a model-independent\nanalysis of medium-range and asymptotic properties of the internal one-body\ndensity. The existence of a spatially decorrelated region in the density\nprofile is related to the existence of three typical energy scales in the\nexcitation spectrum of the {$(N-1)$-body} system. A series of model-independent\nmeasures, taking the internal density as the only input, are introduced. The\nnew measures allow a quantification of the potential halo in terms of the\naverage number of fermions participating to it and of its impact on the system\nextension. Those new \"halo factors\" are validated through simulations and\napplied to results obtained through energy density functional calculations of\nmedium-mass nuclei. Performing spherical Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calculations\nwith state-of-the-art Skyrme plus pairing functionals, a collective halo is\npredicted in drip-line Cr isotopes, whereas no such effect is seen in Sn\nisotopes. \n\n"}

Using the experimental data obtained by NA35 and NA44\ncollaborations for S+S and Pb+Pb collisions, we conclude that the Monte Carlo\nimplementation of the recently developed parton-cascade/cluster-hadronization\nmodel provides a reasonable description of the distributions of the particles\nproduced in such collisions. While the rapidity distribution of the\nmid-rapidity protons is described reasonably well, their transverse momentum\ndistribution falls too rapidly compared to the experimental values, implying a\nsignificant effect of final state scattering among the produced hadrons\nneglected so far. \n\n"}

Employing a recently developed method of constructing\nthe Hilbert space and observables for Klein-Gordon fields, we then obtain the\nprobability current density ${\\cal J}_a^\\mu$ for the localization of a\nKlein-Gordon field in space. We show that in the nonrelativistic limit both\n$J_a^\\mu$ and ${\\cal J}_a^\\mu$ tend to the probability current density for the\nlocalization of a nonrelativistic free particle in space, but that unlike\n$J_a^\\mu$ the current density ${\\cal J}_a^\\mu$ is neither covariant nor\nconserved. Because the total probability may be obtained by integrating either\nof these two current densities over the whole space, the conservation of the\ntotal probability may be viewed as a consequence of the local conservation of\n$J_a^\\mu$. The latter is a manifestation of a previously unnoticed global gauge\nsymmetry of the Klein-Gordon fields. The corresponding gauge group is U(1) if\nthe parameter $a$ is rational. It is the multiplicative group of positive real\nnumbers if $a$ is irrational. We also discuss an extension of our results to\nKlein-Gordon fields minimally coupled to an electromagnetic field. \n\n"}
