As early as 1967, in a pioneering work, V.

Optical microresonators simultaneously host\noptical and mechanical modes, which are systematically analyzed and optimized\nto feature ultra-low mechanical dissipation, photon storage times exceeding the\nmechanical oscillation period (i.e. the \"resolved-sideband regime\") and large\noptomechanical coupling. It is demonstrated that dynamical backaction can be\nemployed to cool mechanical modes, i.e., to reduce their thermally excited\nrandom motion.

We first\nmap the problem onto the canonical model of cavity optomechanics, in which the\nmolecular vibration and the plasmon are \\textit{parametrically coupled}. The\noptomechanical coupling rate, from which we derive the Raman cross section, is\ncomputed from the molecules Raman activities and the plasmonic field\ndistribution. When the plasmon decay rate is comparable or smaller than the\nvibrational frequency and the excitation laser is blue-detuned from the plasmon\nonto the vibrational sideband, the resulting delayed feedback force can lead to\nefficient parametric amplification of molecular vibrations. The optomechanical\ntheory provides a quantitative framework for the calculation of enhanced\ncross-sections, recovers known results, and enables the design of novel systems\nthat leverage dynamical backaction to achieve additional, mode-selective\nenhancement.

Stabilizer codes are attractive solutions to\nthis problem, as they are analogous to classical linear codes, have simple and\neasily computed encoding networks, and allow efficient syndrome extraction. In\nthese codes, syndrome extraction is performed via multi-qubit stabilizer\nmeasurements, which are bit and phase parity checks up to local operations.\nPreviously, stabilizer codes have been realized in nuclei, trapped-ions, and\nsuperconducting qubits. However these implementations lack the ability to\nperform fault-tolerant syndrome extraction which continues to be a challenge\nfor all physical quantum computing systems.

In\nthe smallest QEC codes, the information in one logical qubit is encoded in a\ntwo-dimensional subspace of a larger Hilbert space of multiple physical qubits.\nFor each code, a set of non-demolition multi-qubit measurements, termed\nstabilizers, can discretize and signal physical qubit errors without collapsing\nthe encoded information. Experimental demonstrations of QEC to date, using\nnuclear magnetic resonance, trapped ions, photons, superconducting qubits, and\nNV centers in diamond, have circumvented stabilizers at the cost of decoding at\nthe end of a QEC cycle.

Abstract: Quantum computation, in particular Grover's algorithm, has aroused a great\ndeal of interest since it allows for a quadratic speedup to be obtained in\nsearch procedures. Classical search procedures for an $N$ element database\nrequire at most $O(N)$ time complexity. Grover's algorithm is able to find a\nsolution with high probability in $O(\\sqrt{N})$ time through an amplitude\namplification scheme.

Our proposition\nto quantum search combines quantum entanglement detection alongside\nentanglement inducing operators.

The quantum algorithm can be used either to\nfind a valid assignment (or to certify that no solution exists) or to count the\ntotal number of valid assignments. The query complexities for the worst-case\nare respectively bounded by $O(\\sqrt{2^{n-M^{\\prime}}})$ and\n$O(2^{n-M^{\\prime}})$, where $n$ is the number of variables and $M^{\\prime}$\nthe number of linearly independent clauses. Remarkably, the proposed quantum\nalgorithm results to be faster than any known exact classical algorithm to\nsolve dense formulas of XSAT. As a concrete application, we provide the\nworst-case complexity for the Hamiltonian cycle problem obtained after mapping\nit to a suitable XSAT. Specifically, we show that the time complexity for the\nproposed quantum algorithm is bounded by $O(2^{n/4})$ for 3-regular undirected\ngraphs, where $n$ is the number of nodes. The same worst-case complexity holds\nfor $(3,3)$-regular bipartite graphs (the current best classical algorithm has\na (worst-case) running time bounded by $O(2^{31n/96})$).

Although a few\nanalytical methods have been briefly investigated for describing pulsed\nsingle-photon sources, these methods apply only to either perfectly ideal or at\nleast extremely idealized sources. Here, we present the first complete picture\nof pulsed single-photon sources by elaborating how to numerically and fully\ncharacterize non-ideal single-photon sources operating in a pulsed regime. In\norder to achieve this result, we make the connection between quantum\nMonte--Carlo simulations, experimental characterizations, and an extended form\nof the quantum regression theorem. We elaborate on how an ideal pulsed\nsingle-photon source is connected to its photocount distribution and its\nmeasured degree of second- and first-order optical coherence.

It is postulated that the spacetime region on which\nthe evolution of the state vector exists is bounded towards the future by a\nborder that is dynamically moving towards the future, and at which the state\nvector must fulfil a boundary condition. Wavefunction collapse is represented\nin such a way that the evolution of the state vector changes abruptly at\ncritical spacetime expansions to an evolution resembling a classical\ntrajectory. This can explain the correlations in EPR experiments without coming\ninto conflict with relativity, since the evolution of the state vector before\nand after the abrupt change is governed solely by local physical laws.

Under the\npremise that the the allowed probabilistic models satisfy the No Signalling\nprinciple, Foulis and Randall defined the unique possible way to compose two\ncontextuality scenarios. When composing strictly-more than two test spaces,\nhowever, a variety of possible composition methods have been conceived.\nNevertheless, all these formally-distinct composition methods appear to give\nrise to observationally equivalent scenarios, in the sense that the different\ncompositions all allow precisely the same sets of classical and quantum\nprobabilistic models. This raises the question of whether this property of\ninvariance-under-composition-method is special to classical and quantum\nprobabilistic models, or if it generalizes to other probabilistic models as\nwell, our particular focus being $\\mathcal{Q}_1$ models. $\\mathcal{Q}_1$ models\nare physically important since, when applied to scenarios constructed by a\nparticular composition rule, coincide with the well-defined \"Almost Quantum\nCorrelations\".

These fields can be difficult to\nspatially confine to single donor qubits so alternative methods of control such\nas AC electric field driven spin resonance are desirable. However, donor spin\nqubits do not have electric dipole moments so that they can not normally be\ndriven by electric fields. In this work we challenge that notion by\ndemonstrating a new, all-electric-field method for controlling neutral $^{31}$P\nand $^{75}$As donor nuclear spins in silicon through modulation of their\ndonor-bound electrons. This method has major advantages over magnetic field\ncontrol since electric fields are easy to confine at the nanoscale.

In this paper we\ndevelop further insights on the properties of the above inequality and its\napplications to classical and quantum information theory.\n  In the first part of the paper, we show how to find known and new necessary\nand sufficient conditions under which saturation with equality occurs.\nSubsequently, we discuss the role of the classical transpose channel (also\nknown as Petz recovery map) in this problem and find its action explicitly. We\nthen prove some extensions of the saturation theorem, by finding faithful lower\nbounds on a log-det conditional mutual information.\n  In the second part, we focus on quantum Gaussian states, whose covariance\nmatrices are not only positive but obey additional constraints due to the\nuncertainty relation.

To arrive at\nthis result, we derive the leading corrections to the lumped-element Josephson\nparametric amplifier of three common pumping schemes: monochromatic current\npump, bichromatic current pump, and monochromatic flux pump.

This assumption of the fundamentality of objective reality is often seen\nas a major prerequisite of any kind of scientific reasoning. However, here I\nargue that we should consider relaxing this assumption in a specific way in\nsome contexts. Namely, there is a collection of open questions in and around\nphysics that can arguably be addressed in a substantially more consistent and\nrigorous way if we consider the possibility that the first-person perspective\nis ultimately more fundamental than our usual notion of external world. These\nare questions like: which probabilities should an observer assign to future\nexperiences if she is told that she will be simulated on a computer? How should\nwe think of cosmology's Boltzmann brain problem, and what can we learn from the\nfact that measurements in quantum theory seem to do more than just reveal\npreexisting properties?

Here the cooperativity per atom is determined by\nthe ratio between the measurement strength and the decoherence rate.\nCounterintuitively, we find that by placing the atoms at an azimuthal position\nwhere the guided probe mode has the lowest intensity, we increase the\ncooperativity.

Instead of focusing\non the entire wave function, we measure the distance $d^2(t)$ by investigating\nthe difference of two reduced density matrices of the subsystem $A$ that is\nspatially separated from the local perturbation. This distance $d^2(t)$ grows\nwith time and eventually saturates to a small constant. We interpret the\ndistance growth in terms of operator scrambling picture, which relates $d^2(t)$\nto the square of commutator $C(t)$ (out-of-time-order correlator) and shows\nthat both these quantities measure the area of the operator wave front in\nsubsystem $A$. Among various one-dimensional spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ models, we\nnumerically show that the models with non-local power-law interaction can have\nan exponentially growing regime in $d^2(t)$ when the local perturbation and\nsubsystem $A$ are well separated.

Starting from\na high symmetry optical flux lattice, we superpose a scalar potential with a\nsuper- or sublattice period in order to eliminate links between the original\nlattice sites. As an alternative to changing connectivity, the approach can\nalso be used to create or remove lattice sites from the underlying parent\nlattice. To demonstrate our concept, we consider the dice lattice geometry as\nan explicit example, and construct a dice lattice with a flux density of half a\nflux quantum per plaquette, providing a pathway to flat bands with a large band\ngap. While the intuition for our proposal stems from analysis of deep optical\nlattices, we demonstrate that the approach is robust even for shallow optical\nflux lattices far from the tight-binding limit. We also provide an alternative\nexperimental proposal to realize a synthetic gauge field in a fully frustrated\ndice lattice based on laser-induced hoppings along individual bonds of the\nlattice, again involving a superlattice potential. In this approach, atoms with\na long-lived excited state are trapped using an 'anti-magic' wavelength of\nlight, allowing the desired complex hopping elements to be induced in a\nspecific laser coupling scheme for the dice lattice geometry. We conclude by\ncomparing the complexity of these alternative approaches, and advocate that\ncomplex optical flux lattices provide the more elegant and easily generalisable\nstrategy. \n\n"}

{"id": "1804.10810", "contents": "Title: Causality re-established Abstract: Causality never gained the status of a \"law\" or \"principle\" in physics. Some\nrecent literature even popularized the false idea that causality is a notion\nthat should be banned from theory. Such misconception relies on an alleged\nuniversality of reversibility of laws of physics, based either on determinism\nof classical theory, or on the multiverse interpretation of quantum theory, in\nboth cases motivated by mere interpretational requirements for realism of the\ntheory. Here, I will show that a properly defined unambiguous notion of\ncausality is a theorem of quantum theory, which is also a falsifiable\nproposition of the theory. Such causality notion appeared in the literature\nwithin the framework of operational probabilistic theories. It is a genuinely\ntheoretical notion, corresponding to establish a definite partial order among\nevents, in the same way as we do by using the future causal cone on Minkowski\nspace. The causality notion is logically completely independent of the\nmisidentified concept of \"determinism\", and, being a consequence of quantum\ntheory, is ubiquitous in physics. In addition, as classical theory can be\nregarded as a restriction of quantum theory, causality holds also in the\nclassical case, although the determinism of the theory trivializes it. I then\nconclude arguing that causality naturally establishes an arrow of time. This\nimplies that the scenario of the \"Block Universe\" and the connected \"Past\nHypothesis\" are incompatible with causality, and thus with quantum theory: they\nboth are doomed to remain mere interpretations and, as such, not falsifiable,\nsimilar to the hypothesis of \"super-determinism\".

Essentially, ancilla errors\nmust not propagate to the encoded system and induce errors beyond those which\ncan be corrected. The current schemes for achieving this fault-tolerance to\nancilla errors come at the cost of increased overhead requirements.

By using quantum interference\nbetween different detuned Rabi oscillations, we propose a practical scheme to\nrealize a class of accurate entangling Rydberg quantum gates subject to a\nminimal dephasing error.

Our method has several\nadvantages. First, the gates are accurate because the fidelity of $U_k$ is\nlimited only by a rotation error below $10^{-5}$ and the Rydberg-state decay.\nDecay error on the order of $10^{-5}$ can be easily obtained because all\ntransitions are detuned, resulting in small population in Rydberg state.\nSecond, the motion-induced dephasing is minimized because there is no gap time\nin which a population is left in the Rydberg shelving states of either qubit.\nThird, the gate is resilient to the variation of $V$. This is because among the\nthree phases $\\alpha,\\gamma$, and $\\beta$, only the last has a (partial)\ndependence on $V$.

Our one-dimensional vacuum is a long section\nof a high wave impedance (comparable to resistance quantum) superconducting\ntransmission line. It is directly wired to a transmon qubit circuit. Owing to\nthe combination of high impedance and galvanic connection, the transmon's\nspontaneous emission linewidth can greatly exceed the discrete transmission\nline modes spacing.

We show how one can optimize the tracking of errors in repeated noisy\nerror correction for the GKP code. We do this by examining the\nmaximum-likelihood problem for this setting and its mapping onto a 1D Euclidean\npath-integral modeling a particle in a random cosine potential. We demonstrate\nthe efficiency of a minimum-energy decoding strategy as a proxy for the path\nintegral evaluation. In the second part of this paper, we analyze and\nnumerically assess the concatenation of the GKP code with the toric code. When\ntoric code measurements and GKP error correction measurements are perfect, we\nfind that by using GKP error information the toric code threshold improves from\n$10\\%$ to $14\\%$. When only the GKP error correction measurements are perfect\nwe observe a threshold at $6\\%$. In the more realistic setting when all error\ninformation is noisy, we show how to represent the maximum likelihood decoding\nproblem for the toric-GKP code as a 3D compact QED model in the presence of a\nquenched random gauge field, an extension of the random-plaquette gauge model\nfor the toric code.

The main novel part of the presented\ntheory concerns generalizations of SFA to: (i) time-dependent treatment of\ntwo-electron atoms, allowing for studies of an interplay between Electron\nImpact Ionization (EII) and Resonant Excitation with Subsequent Ionization\n(RESI); (ii) time-dependent treatment in the single active electron (SAE)\napproximation of \"large\" molecules and targets which are themselves undergoing\ndynamics during the HHG or ATI process. In particular, we formulate the general\nexpressions for the case of arbitrary molecules, combining input from quantum\nchemistry and quantum dynamics. We formulate also theory of time-dependent\nseparable molecular potentials to model analytically the dynamics of realistic\nelectronic wave packets for molecules in strong laser fields. \n\n"}

We investigate the situation for which the two-level system is\ninitially in mixed state taken from a one-parameter set, whereas the field has\nbeen prepared in an arbitrary thermal state. Depending on the particular choice\nfor the initial state and the initial temperature of the quantised field mode,\nthree cases can be distinguished: (i) free entanglement will be created\nimmediately, (ii) free entanglement will be generated, but only at a later time\ndifferent from zero, (iii) the partial transpose of the joint state remains\npositive at all times. It will be demonstrated that increasing the initial\ntemperature of the field mode may cause the joint state to become distillable\nduring the time evolution, in contrast to a non-distillable state at lower\ninitial temperatures. We further assess the generated entanglement\nquantitatively, by evaluating the logarithmic negativity numerically, and by\nproviding an analytical upper bound. \n\n"}

As a striking example we consider\nscattering from transversally illuminated atoms into an optical cavity mode.\nFor the Mott insulator state, similar to classical diffraction, the number of\nphotons scattered into a cavity is zero due to destructive interference, while\nfor the superfluid state it is nonzero and proportional to the number of atoms.\nMoreover, we demonstrate that light scattering into a standing-wave cavity has\na nontrivial angle dependence, including the appearance of narrow features at\nangles, where classical diffraction predicts zero. The measurement procedure\ncorresponds to the quantum non-demolition (QND) measurement of various atomic\nvariables by observing light. \n\n"}

Here, we introduce the\nanalogue of this statement for Gaussian states for any number of modes, and\nsolve it in generality, for pure and mixed states, both concerning necessary\nand sufficient conditions. Formally, our result can be viewed as an analogue of\nthe Sing-Thompson Theorem (respectively Horn's Lemma), characterizing the\nrelationship between main diagonal elements and singular values of a complex\nmatrix: We find necessary and sufficient conditions for vectors (d1, ..., dn)\nand (c1, ..., cn) to be the symplectic eigenvalues and symplectic main diagonal\nelements of a strictly positive real matrix, respectively.

In this work we\nintroduce a natural and compelling fourth assumption: if there is no reason to\nprefer one region of the configuration space over another then they should be\n`weighted' equally. This is the last ingredient necessary to introduce a unique\ninner product in the linear space of wave functions. Thus, a form of the\nprinciple of insufficient reason is implicit in the Hilbert inner product.\nArmed with the inner product we obtain two results. First, we elaborate on an\nearlier proof of the Born probability rule. The implicit appeal to insufficient\nreason shows that quantum probabilities are not more objective than classical\nprobabilities. Previously we had argued that the consistent manipulation of\namplitudes leads to a linear time evolution; our second result is that time\nevolution must also be unitary. The argument is straightforward and hinges on\nthe conservation of entropy. The only subtlety consists of defining the correct\nentropy; it is the array entropy, not von Neumann's. After unitary evolution\nhas been established we proceed to introduce the useful notion of observables\nand we explore how von Neumann's entropy can be linked to Shannon's information\ntheory.
