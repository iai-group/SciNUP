{"id": "0712.2454", "contents": "Title: Evidence for the Multiverse in the Standard Model and Beyond Abstract: In any theory it is unnatural if the observed parameters lie very close to\nspecial values that determine the existence of complex structures necessary for\nobservers. A naturalness probability, P, is introduced to numerically evaluate\nthe unnaturalness. If P is small in all known theories, there is an observer\nnaturalness problem. In addition to the well-known case of the cosmological\nconstant, we argue that nuclear stability and electroweak symmetry breaking\n(EWSB) represent significant observer naturalness problems. The naturalness\nprobability associated with nuclear stability is conservatively estimated as\nP_nuc < 10^{-(3-2)}, and for simple EWSB theories P_EWSB < 10^{-(2-1)}. This\npattern of unnaturalness in three different arenas, cosmology, nuclear physics,\nand EWSB, provides evidence for the multiverse. In the nuclear case the problem\nis largely solved even with a flat multiverse distribution, and with nontrivial\ndistributions it is possible to understand both the proximity to neutron\nstability and the values of m_e and m_d - m_u in terms of the electromagnetic\ncontribution to the proton mass. It is reasonable that multiverse distributions\nare strong functions of Lagrangian parameters due to their dependence on\nvarious factors. In any EWSB theory, strongly varying distributions typically\nlead to a little or large hierarchy, and in certain multiverses the size of the\nlittle hierarchy is enhanced by a loop factor. Since the correct theory of EWSB\nis unknown, our estimate for P_EWSB is theoretical. The LHC will determine\nP_EWSB more robustly, which may remove or strengthen the observer naturalness\nproblem of EWSB. For each of the three arenas, the discovery of a natural\ntheory would eliminate the evidence for the multiverse; but in the absence of\nsuch a theory, the multiverse provides a provisional understanding of the data. \n\n"}

We\ndiscuss the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuz'min (GZK) energy cutoff for cosmic protons,\nwhich is predicted due to photopion production in the Cosmic Microwave\nBackground (CMB). This is a process of modest energy in the proton rest frame.\nIt can be investigated to a high precision in the laboratory, if Lorentz\ntransformations apply even at factors $\\gamma \\sim O(10^{11})$. For heavier\nnuclei the energy attenuation is even faster due to photo-disintegration, again\nif this process is Lorentz invariant. Hence the viability of Lorentz symmetry\nup to tremendous gamma-factors - far beyond accelerator tests - is a central\nissue. Next we comment on conceptual aspects of Lorentz Invariance and the\npossibility of its spontaneous breaking. This could lead to slightly particle\ndependent ``Maximal Attainable Velocities''.

However, for WIMP masses of ~8 GeV some parameters outside these\nregions still yield a moderately reasonable fit to the DAMA data and are\ncompatible with all 90% C.L. upper limits from negative searches, when\nchanneling is included. For spin-dependent (SD) interactions with proton-only\ncouplings, a range of masses below 10 GeV is compatible with DAMA and other\nexperiments, with and without channeling, when SuperK indirect detection\nconstraints are included; without the SuperK constraints, masses as high as ~20\nGeV are compatible. For SD neutron-only couplings we find no parameters\ncompatible with all the experiments. Mixed SD couplings are examined: e.g. ~8\nGeV mass WIMPs with a_n = +/- a_p are found to be consistent with all\nexperiments. In short, there are surviving regions at low mass for both SI and\nSD interactions; if indirect detection limits are relaxed, some SD proton-only\ncouplings at high masses also survive. \n\n"}

The approximation scheme is fully specified by giving the\n2-point function (the S-matrix for a color dipole), which in turn can be\nrelated to the solution to the Balitsky-Kovchegov equation, including at finite\nNc.

In the case of an incoming electron neutrino undergoing a\ncharged current interaction, the produced UHE electron will induce an\nunderground electromagnetic shower. At high energy (above 7.7 TeV in standard\nrock), such showers are subject to LPM (Landau, Pomeranchuk and Migdal)\nsuppression of the radiative processes cross sections (bremsstrahlung and pair\nproduction).

This explains why all classical (non-quantum) WDM N-body\nsimulations fail to explain galactic cores and their sizes. We describe\nfermionic WDM galaxies in an analytic semiclassical framework based on the\nThomas-Fermi approach, we resolve it numerically and find the main physical\ngalaxy magnitudes: mass, halo radius, phase-space density, velocity dispersion,\nfully consistent with observations, including compact dwarf galaxies.

This hypothesis leads to testable consequences,\nperhaps portending the discovery of a rich hidden world neighboring our own. We\nconsider a scenario that readily satisfies current bounds that we call\nPartially Interacting Dark Matter (PIDM). This scenario contains\nself-interacting dark matter, but it is not the dominant component. Even if\nPIDM contains only a fraction of the net dark matter density, comparable to the\nbaryonic fraction, the subdominant component's interactions can lead to\ninteresting and potentially observable consequences. Our primary focus will be\nthe special case of Double-Disk Dark Matter (DDDM), in which self-interactions\nallow the dark matter to lose enough energy to lead to dynamics similar to\nthose in the baryonic sector.

In this context, $\\mathcal{O}$(PeV) dark matter particles\ndecaying to neutrinos have been considered while dark matter annihilation has\nbeen dismissed invoking the unitarity bound as a limiting factor. However, the\nlatter claim was done ignoring the contribution from dark matter substructure,\nwhich for PeV Cold Dark Matter would extend down to a free streaming mass of\n$\\mathcal{O}$($10^{-18}$M$_\\odot$). Since the unitarity bound is less stringent\nat low velocities, ($\\sigma_{\\rm ann}$v)$\\leq4\\pi/m_\\chi^2v$, then, it is\npossible that these cold and dense subhalos would contribute dominantly to a\ndark-matter-induced neutrino flux and easily account for the events observed by\nIceCube. A Sommerfeld-enhanced dark matter model can naturally support such\nscenario. Interestingly, the spatial distribution of the events shows features\nthat would be expected in a dark matter interpretation. Although not\nconclusive, 9 of the 37 events appear to be clustered around a region near the\nGalactic Center while 6 others spatially coincide, within the reported angular\nerrors, with 5 of 26 Milky Way satellites.

In such a scenario the constraints from direct and indirect\ndetection, and from collider searches for dark matter, can easily be satisfied.\nThe masses of such light hidden states can be protected by symmetry if they are\nNambu-Goldstone bosons, fermions, or gauge bosons. These states can then\ncontribute to the cosmic energy density as dark radiation, leading to\nobservable signals in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Furthermore,\ndepending on whether or not the light hidden sector states self-interact, the\nfraction of the total energy density that free-streams is either decreased or\nincreased, leading to characteristic effects on both the scalar and tensor\ncomponents of the CMB anisotropy that allows these two cases to be\ndistinguished.

These\nfeatures make tribrid inflation a promising framework for realising inflation\nwith particularly close connections to particle physics. Superpotentials of\ntribrid inflation involve effective operators suppressed by some cutoff scale,\nwhich is often taken as the Planck scale. However, these operators may also be\ngenerated by integrating out messenger superfields with masses below the Planck\nscale, which is in fact quite common in GUT and/or flavour models. The values\nof the inflaton field during inflation can then lie above this mass scale,\nwhich means that for reliably calculating the model predictions one has to go\nbeyond the effective theory description. We therefore discuss realisations of\neffective theories of tribrid inflation and specify in which cases effects from\nthe messenger fields are expected, and under which conditions they can safely\nbe neglected.

The baryon asymmetry is determined by\na competition between the helical hypermagnetic field, which sources baryon\nnumber, and the electroweak sphaleron, which tends to wash out baryon number.\nAt the electroweak crossover both of these processes become inactive; the\nhypermagnetic field is converted into an electromagnetic field, which does not\nsource baryon number, and the weak gauge boson masses grow, suppressing the\nelectroweak sphaleron reaction. An accurate prediction of the relic baryon\nasymmetry requires a careful treatment of the crossover. We extend our previous\nstudy [K. Kamada and A. J. Long, Phys. Rev.

In order for a renormalization group (RG) improved effective $\\lambda\n\\phi^4$ potential to develop an inflection-point, the running quartic coupling\n$\\lambda(\\phi)$ must exhibit a minimum with an almost vanishing value in its RG\nevolution, namely $\\lambda(\\phi_I) \\simeq 0$ and $\\beta_{\\lambda}(\\phi_I)\n\\simeq 0$, where $\\beta_{\\lambda}$ is the beta-function of the quartic\ncoupling.

Then, these axions\nremain in the expanding Universe contributing to the dark radiation component,\nwhich is severely bounded from present cosmological data. We place a general\nconstraint on the axion production rate and apply it to several variants of\nreasonable inflaton-to-axion couplings. The limit merely constrains the number\nof ultralight axions and the relative strength of inflaton-to-axion coupling.\nIt is valid in both large and small field inflationary models irrespectively of\nthe axion energy scales and masses. Thus, the limit is complementary to those\nassociated with the Universe overclosure and axion isocurvature fluctuations.\nIn particular, a hundred of axions is forbidden if inflaton universally couples\nto all the fields at reheating.

In the case of DM consisting of Weakly-Interacting Massive\nParticles (WIMPs), self-annihilation ultimately produces observable products\nincluding $e^{\\pm}$ pairs and gamma rays. The gamma rays can be detected\ndirectly, while the $e^{\\pm}$ pairs can be detected by radio emission from\nsynchrotron radiation or X-rays and soft gamma rays from inverse Compton\nscattering. An intriguing region to search for astrophysical signs of DM is the\nGalactic center (GC) of the Milky Way, due in part to an observed excess of\ngamma-rays that could be DM. A recent observation by the Fermi-LAT\ncollaboration of a similar excess in the central region of the Andromeda galaxy\n(M31) leads us to explore the possibility of a DM-induced signal there as well.\nWe use the RX-DMFIT tool to perform a multi-frequency analysis of potential DM\nannihilation emissions in M31. We consider WIMP models consistent with the GC\nexcess and calculate the expected emission across the electromagnetic spectrum\nin comparison with available observational data from M31.

In this paper, we discuss the RPV\ninteractions for resolving the $R_{D^{(\\ast)}}$ anomaly with the Grand Unified\nTheory (GUT) assumption. To solve the $R_{D^{(\\ast)}}$ anomaly, it is known\nthat large RPV couplings and around $1~{\\rm TeV}$ sfermion masses are required.\nAt the same time, large RPV couplings are conducive to realize the bottom-tau\nYukawa unification which appears in the GUT models. On the other hand, there\nare problems for realizing favorable sfermion masses in the constrained minimal\nsupersymetric standard model. To resolve these problems, we show that two\nnon-universalities, the non-universal sfermion masses and the non-universal\ngaugino masses, are favorable. \n\n"}

This is an\nalternative mechanism to generate observable (almost) scale free adiabatic\nmetric perturbations.

The symmetry will be spontaneously broken again in a given\nfluctuation region as the temperature drops there (for fluctuations with length\nscales smaller than the horizon), resulting in the production of baryon\nasymmetry. The time scale of the transition will be governed by the wavelength\nof fluctuation and, hence, can be much smaller than the Hubble time. This leads\nto strong enhancement in the production of baryon asymmetry for a second order\nelectroweak phase transition as compared to the case when transition happens\ndue to the cooling of the universe via expansion. For a two-Higgs extension of\nthe Standard Model (with appropriate CP violation), we show that one can get\nthe required baryon to entropy ratio if fluctuations propagate without getting\nsignificantly damped.

This model is\nsupplemented with hybrid inflation and leptogenesis, but without taking the\nspecific details of these scenarios. It is shown that the Peccei-Quinn field\ncan successfully act as a curvaton generating the total curvature perturbation\nin the universe in accord with the cosmic background explorer measurements. A\ncrucial phenomenon, which assists us to achieve this, is the \"tachyonic\namplification\" of the perturbation acquired by this field during inflation if\nthe field, in its subsequent evolution, happens to be stabilized for a while\nnear a maximum of the potential. In this case, the contribution of the field to\nthe total energy density is also enhanced (\"tachyonic effect\"), which helps\ntoo. The cold dark matter in the universe consists, in this model, mainly of\naxions which carry an isocurvature perturbation uncorrelated with the total\ncurvature perturbation. There are also lightest sparticles (neutralinos) which,\nlike the baryons, originate from the inflationary reheating and, thus, acquire\nan isocurvature perturbation fully correlated with the curvature perturbation.\nSo, the overall isocurvature perturbation has a mixed correlation with the\nadiabatic one.

There are a variety of scenarios leading to acceptably small\nZ-Z' mixing and other phenomenological consequences, all of which involve some\nbut not excessive fine tuning. One class, driven by a large trilinear soft\nsupersymmetry breaking term, implies small mixing, a light Z' (e.g., 200 GeV),\nand an electroweak phase transition that may be first order at tree level. In\nanother class, with m_S^2 < 0 (radiative breaking), the typical scale of\ndimensional parameters, including M_{Z'} and the effective mu, is O(1 TeV), but\nthe electroweak scale is smaller due to cancellations.

Finally, we perform a general discussion of the asymptotic behaviour\n$t \\to \\infty$ of the density matrix and we relate the two types of asymptotic\nbehaviour with our geometric version of $D[\\rho]$. \n\n"}

Mostafazadeh\nand F. Zamani in December, 2003, and February, 2006 (quant-ph/0312078,\nquant-ph/0602151, quant-ph/0602161). It is explicitly shown that the positive\nsemi-definite norm associated with the derived inner product for real KG fields\nmeasures the number of active positive and negative energy Fourier modes of the\nreal KG field on the relativistic mass shell. The very existence of an inner\nproduct with positive semi-definite norm for the considered real, i.e. neutral,\nKG fields shows that the metric operator entering the inner product does not\ncontain the charge-conjugation operator. This observation sheds some additional\nlight on the meaning of the C operator in the CPT inner product of PT-symmetric\nQuantum Mechanics defined by C.M. Bender, D.C. Brody and H.F. Jones. \n\n"}
{"id": "quant-ph/9703019", "contents": "Title: Radiative Corrections to the Casimir Energy Abstract: The lowest radiative correction to the Casimir energy density between two\nparallel plates is calculated using effective field theory. Since the\ncorrelators of the electromagnetic field diverge near the plates, the\nregularized energy density is also divergent. However, the regularized integral\nof the energy density is finite and varies with the plate separation L as\n1/L^7. This apparently paradoxical situation is analyzed in an equivalent, but\nmore transparent theory of a massless scalar field in 1+1 dimensions confined\nto a line element of length L and satisfying Dirichlet boundary conditions. \n\n"}
