Curve Flows and Solitonic Hierarchies Abstract: The geometric constructions are elaborated on (semi) Riemannian manifolds and\nvector bundles provided with nonintegrable distributions defining nonlinear\nconnection structures induced canonically by metric tensors.

We show that the CMB anisotropies are regulated by spacetime window\nfunctions which have support only inside the past light-cone of the point of\nobservation. Second, we show that the Fourier-Bessel expansion of the physical\nfields (including the temperature and polarization momenta) is an alternative\nto the usual Fourier basis as a framework to compute the anisotropies.

In\nrecent years there has been considerable controversy on this issue. In\nparticular, for a quadratic potential, Kofman, Linde and Mukhanov have argued\nthat the probability of inflation with at least 65 e-foldings is close to one,\nwhile Gibbons and Turok have argued that this probability is suppressed by a\nfactor of ~ $\\10^{-85}$. We first clarify that such dramatically different\npredictions can arise because the required measure on the space of solutions is\nintrinsically ambiguous in general relativity. We then show that this ambiguity\ncan be naturally resolved in loop quantum cosmology (LQC) because the big bang\nis replaced by a big bounce and the bounce surface can be used to introduce the\nstructure necessary to specify a satisfactory measure.\n  The second goal of the paper is to present a detailed analysis of the\ninflationary dynamics of LQC using analytical and numerical methods.

String Theory is a top-to-bottom approach to Quantum\nSupergravity in that it postulates a new object, the string, from which\nclassical Supergravity emerges as a low energy limit.

In order to do so we improve an analytic description of relativistic\nradiation mediated shocks and follow the system from the breakout itself,\nthrough the planar phase and into the spherical phase. We limit our calculation\nto cases where the post breakout acceleration of the gas ends during the planar\nphase. (i.e., the final gas Lorentz factor <~30).

The breakout flare is\ntypically followed, on longer time scales, by X-rays that carry a comparable\nenergy.

This fact lead us to suspect that the superconductivity of\ngravitation ought to be a real physical process occurring in the outskirts of\ngalaxies. It is found that quantum mechanically gravity can achieve a type-II\nsuperconductor state characterised by the Gizburg-Landau parameter\n$\\kappa=1.5$, and it is suggested that a probability flux of Cooper pairs\n(quantum gravitational geons charged with vacuum energy) are directly\nresponsible for the flatness exhibited by the rotation curves in spiral\ngalaxies, as well as the exotic behaviour observed in galactic cluster\ncollisions.

The optical light curve of some SNe may be powered by the outward\ndiffusion of the energy deposited by the explosion shock in optically thick\ncircumstellar matter (CSM). Recently, it was shown that the radiation-mediated\nand -dominated shock in an optically thick wind must transform into a\ncollisionless shock and can produce hard X-rays. The X-rays are expected to\npeak at late times, relative to maximum visible light. Here we report on a\nsearch, using Swift and Chandra, for X-ray emission from 28 SNe that belong to\nclasses whose progenitors are suspected to be embedded in dense CSM\n(IIn/Ibn/SLSN-I). Two SNe in our sample have X-ray properties that are roughly\nconsistent with the expectation for X-rays from a collisionless shock in\noptically thick CSM. Therefore, we suggest that their optical light curves are\npowered by shock breakout in CSM. We show that two other events were too X-ray\nbright during the SN maximum optical light to be explained by the shock\nbreakout model.

The denominator is a 2(n+k-2) x 2(n+k-2) minor of a\n2(n+k) x 2(n+k) matrix of rank 2(n+k-2).

Each first-class constraint\nin Maxwell's theory generates a change in the electric field E by an arbitrary\ngradient, spoiling Gauss's law. The secondary constraint p^i,_i=0 still holds,\nbut being a function of derivatives of momenta (mere auxiliary fields), it is\nnot directly about the observable electric field (a function of derivatives of\nA), which couples to charge. Only a special combination of the two first-class\nconstraints, the Anderson-Bergmann-Castellani gauge generator G, leaves E\nunchanged. Likewise only that combination leaves the canonical action\ninvariant---an argument independent of observables. If one uses a first-class\nconstraint to generate instead a canonical transformation, one partly strips\nthe canonical coordinates of physical meaning as electromagnetic potentials,\nvindicating the Anderson-Bergmann Lagrangian orientation of interesting\ncanonical transformations. The need to keep gauge-invariant q,t-dH/dp=-E-p=0\nsupports using the gauge generator and primary Hamiltonian rather than the\nseparate first-class constraints and the extended Hamiltonian.\n  Partly paralleling Pons's criticism, it is shown that Dirac's proof that a\nfirst-class primary constraint generates a gauge transformation, by comparing\nevolutions from _identical_ initial data, cancels out and hence fails to detect\nthe alterations made to the initial state.

Though the bounce\nhas been exhibited in various matter models, due to severe computational\nchallenges some important questions have so far remained unaddressed. These\ninclude the demonstration of the bounce for widely spread states, its detailed\nproperties for the states when matter field probes regions close to the Planck\nvolume and the reliability of the continuum effective spacetime description in\ngeneral. In this manuscript we rigorously answer these questions using the\nChimera numerical scheme for the isotropic spatially flat model sourced with a\nmassless scalar field. We show that as expected from an exactly solvable model,\nthe quantum bounce is a generic feature of states even with a very wide spread,\nand for those which bounce much closer to the Planck volume. We perform a\ndetailed analysis of the departures from the effective description and find\nsome expected, and some surprising results.

Quantifying the amount of discrepancy between the quantum and\nthe effective dynamics, we find that the departure between them depends in a\nsubtle and non-monotonic way on the field momentum and different fluctuations.\nInterestingly, the departures are generically found to be such that the\neffective dynamics overestimates the spacetime curvature, and underestimates\nthe volume at the bounce. \n\n"}

We point out, in the 4D spatially flat FLRW\nuniverse, that the causal structure of transverse-traceless (TT) gravitational\nwaves can be elucidated by first reducing the problem to a 2D Minkowski wave\nequation with a time dependent potential, where the relevant Green's function\nis pure tail -- waves produced by a physical source propagate strictly within\nthe null cone. By viewing this 2D world as embedded in a 4D one, the 2D Green's\nfunction can also be seen to be sourced by a cylindrically symmetric scalar\nfield in 3D. From both the 2D wave equation as well as the 3D scalar\nperspective, we recover the exact solution of the 4D graviton tail, for the\ncase where the scale factor written in conformal time is a power law. There are\nno TT gravitational wave tails when the universe is radiation dominated because\nthe background Ricci scalar is zero. In a matter dominated one, we estimate the\namplitude of the tail to be suppressed relative to its null counterpart by both\nthe ratio of the duration of the source to the age of the universe $\\eta_0$,\nand the ratio of the observer-source spatial distance (at the observer's time)\nto the same $\\eta_0$.

In fact both commonplaces are wrong.\nOgievetsky and Polubarinov (OP) constructed spinors in coordinates in 1965,\nenhancing the unity of physics and helping to spawn nonlinear group\nrepresentations. Roughly and locally, OP spinors resemble the orthonormal basis\nor tetrad formalism in the symmetric gauge, but they are conceptually\nself-sufficient and more economical. The tetrad formalism is thus\nde-Ockhamized, with six extra components and six compensating gauge symmetries.\nAs developed nonperturbatively by Bilyalov, OP spinors admit any coordinates at\na point, but 'time' must be listed first; 'time' is defined by an eigenvalue\nproblem involving the metric and diag(-1,1,1,1), the product of which must have\nno negative eigenvalues. Thus even formal general covariance requires\nreconsideration; admissible coordinates should be sensitive to the types and\n_values_ of the fields.

Recent progress on implementing\ntechniques of loop quantum gravity to cosmological models reveals that such\nsingularities may be generically resolved because of the quantum gravitational\neffects.

One can thus bypass the need to select a\nvacuum state for the theory, and still be provided with an explicit and\nconstructive description of the quantum state space, at least as long as the\nlabel set indexing the projective structure is countable.

Abstract: Quantum nature of classical flat Kasner spacetime is studied using effective\nspacetime description in loop quantum cosmology. We find that even though the\nspacetime curvature vanishes at the classical level, non-trivial quantum\ngravitational effects can arise. For the standard loop quantization of\nBianchi-I spacetime, which uniquely yields universal bounds on expansion and\nshear scalars and results in a generic resolution of strong singularities, we\nfind that a flat Kasner metric is not a physical solution of the effective\nspacetime description, except in a limit. The lack of a flat Kasner metric at\nthe quantum level results from a novel feature of the loop quantum Bianchi-I\nspacetime: quantum geometry induces non-vanishing spacetime curvature\ncomponents, making it not Ricci flat even when no matter is present. The\nnon-curvature singularity of the classical flat Kasner spacetime is avoided,\nand the effective spacetime transits from a flat Kasner spacetime in asymptotic\nfuture, to a Minkowski spacetime in asymptotic past. Interestingly, for an\nalternate loop quantization which does not share some of the fine features of\nthe standard quantization, flat Kasner spacetime with expected classical\nfeatures exists.

In addition, loop quantum cosmology could bridge contact with\nastronomical observations, and thus potentially investigate quantum cosmology\nmodellings in the light of observations.

One of\ntheir important key features is the invariance of the corresponding reduced\nactions under reparametrizations of the independent variable, a fact that can\nbe seen as the remnant of the general covariance of the full theory. In the\ncase of a system of $n$ degrees of freedom, described by a Lagrangian quadratic\nin velocities, one can use the lapse by either gauge fixing it or letting it be\ndefined by the constraint and subsequently substitute into the rest of the\nequations. In the first case, the system is solvable for $n$ accelerations and\nthe constraint becomes a restriction among constants.

For massive photons, the\nde Broglie-Proca non-gauge formulation observable A_{\\mu} is equivalent to the\nStueckelberg-Utiyama gauge formulation quantity A_{\\mu}+\\partial_{\\mu} \\phi.\nThus observables must have 0 Poisson bracket not with each first-class\nconstraint, but with the Rosenfeld-Anderson-Bergmann-Castellani gauge generator\nG, a tuned sum of first-class constraints, in accord with the\nPons-Salisbury-Sundermeyer definition of observables.\n  The definition for external gauge symmetries can be tested using massive\ngravity, where one can install gauge freedom by parametrization with clock\nfields X^A. The non-gauge observable g^{\\mu\\nu} has the gauge equivalent\nX^A,_{\\mu} g^{\\mu\\nu} X^B,_{\\nu}.

Here the\nquantum nuclear shell model is adopted to describe the permitted energy levels\nof the SB, which are assumed to be identical to the discrete spinning rates\n$\\Omega_{SB},$ that SBs are allowed to rotate with. Accordingly, a glitch-event\ncorresponds to a prompt spin-down of the superconducting SB from one energy\nlevel to the next, thereby expelling a certain number of vortices, which in\nturn spins-up the ambient medium. The process is provoked mainly by the\nnegative torque of the ambient dissipative nuclear fluid and by a universal\nscalar field $\\phi$ at the background of a supranuclear dense matter.

Uncertain states on\n$I_U$ are described using complex Hilbert states, but only if their squared\namplitudes are rational and corresponding complex phase angles are rational\nmultiples of $2 \\pi$. Such Hilbert states are necessarily $g_p$-distant from\nstates with either irrational squared amplitudes or irrational phase angles.\nThe gappy fractal nature of $I_U$ accounts for quantum complementarity and is\ncharacterised numerically by a generic number-theoretic incommensurateness\nbetween rational angles and rational cosines of angles.

The nature and origin of the multiverse idea presented in this\npaper, that is shared by the fields in the standard model coupled to gravity,\nis different from other notions of a multiverse.

In classical general relativity, extended Rindler space is\nequivalent to flat Minkowski space; it consists of the union of the four wedges\nin (u,v) light-cone coordinates as in Fig.(1). In quantum mechanics, the\nwavefunction is an analytic function of (u,v) that is sensitive to branch\npoints at the horizons u=0 or v=0, with branch cuts attached to them.

By contrast, for an\neternal black hole spacetime, which may be viewed as a modification of Rindler\nthat includes gravitational interactions, analyticity shows how information is\nlost due to a flow to other universes, enabled by an additional branch point\nand cut due to the black hole singularity. \n\n"}

Such misconception relies on an alleged\nuniversality of reversibility of laws of physics, based either on determinism\nof classical theory, or on the multiverse interpretation of quantum theory, in\nboth cases motivated by mere interpretational requirements for realism of the\ntheory. Here, I will show that a properly defined unambiguous notion of\ncausality is a theorem of quantum theory, which is also a falsifiable\nproposition of the theory. Such causality notion appeared in the literature\nwithin the framework of operational probabilistic theories. It is a genuinely\ntheoretical notion, corresponding to establish a definite partial order among\nevents, in the same way as we do by using the future causal cone on Minkowski\nspace. The causality notion is logically completely independent of the\nmisidentified concept of \"determinism\", and, being a consequence of quantum\ntheory, is ubiquitous in physics. In addition, as classical theory can be\nregarded as a restriction of quantum theory, causality holds also in the\nclassical case, although the determinism of the theory trivializes it.

We present a new\nmethod to show that the conventional dark energy models based on single\nk-essence field and perfect fluid cannot act as quintom due to the\nsingularities and classical instabilities of perturbations around $w = -1$. One\nneeds to add extra degrees of freedom for successful quintom model buildings.\nThere are no singularities or classical instabilities in perturbations of\nrealistic quintom models and they are potentially distinguishable from the\ncosmological constant. Basing on the realistic quintom models in this paper we\nprovide one way to include the perturbations for dark energy models with\nparametrized equation of state across -1. Compare with those assuming no dark\nenergy perturbations, we find that the parameter space which allows the\nequation of state to get across -1 will be enlarged in general when including\nthe perturbations. \n\n"}

Thus the model has a\npotential to naturally underpin Dirac's suggestion for explaining the\nlarge-number hypothesis, which demands a dynamical $G_{N}$ along with the\ncreation of matter in the universe.

If the magnetic part is ignored, then the newtonian\nlimit of the relativistic equations is reduced to the closed set of the local\nLagrangian equations. Recently this fact drew much attention since the\ngravitational instability in that form would greatly simplify the study of\ncosmic structure formation. In particular, the filamentary structure of\ncollapsing is predicted. In this paper we resolve the contradiction between the\nnewtonian theory and relativistic version adopted in some recent papers. We\nshow that dropping the magnetic part from the basic relativistic equations is\n{\\it incorrect}. The correct newtonian limit is derived by the $1/c$-expansion\nof the GR equations and the Bianchi identities for the Weyl tensor. The last\nones begin with $\\sim 1/c^3$ order, therefore one {\\it must} take into account\nthe magnetic part in the post newtonian order $\\sim 1/c^3$, which contains\nnon-local terms, related to the non-local gravitational interaction. For the\nfirst time we rigorously show that the GR equations with the magnetic part are\nreduced precisely to the canonic newtonian non-local equations. Thus, the\ncorrect treatment of the relativistic version of the gravitational instability\nresurrects the canonic picture of the structure formation. \n\n"}

These future and past sets are just the future and\npast of the ideal point within the original spacetime. This provides our\nconstruction with useful causal properties and leads to more satisfactory\nresults in a number of examples. We are also able to endow the completion with\na topology.

In both topologies, the completion is the\noriginal spacetime together with endpoints for all timelike curves. We explore\nthis procedure in several examples, and in particular for plane wave solutions,\nwith satisfactory results. \n\n"}

Abstract: The prediction that black holes radiate due to quantum effects is often\nconsidered one of the most secure in quantum field theory in curved space-time.\nYet this prediction rests on two dubious assumptions: that ordinary physics may\nbe applied to vacuum fluctuations at energy scales increasing exponentially\nwithout bound; and that quantum-gravitational effects may be neglected. Various\nsuggestions have been put forward to address these issues: that they might be\nexplained away by lessons from sonic black hole models; that the prediction is\nindeed successfully reproduced by quantum gravity; that the success of the link\nprovided by the prediction between black holes and thermodynamics justifies the\nprediction.\n  This paper explains the nature of the difficulties, and reviews the proposals\nthat have been put forward to deal with them. None of the proposals put forward\ncan so far be considered to be really successful, and simple dimensional\narguments show that quantum-gravitational effects might well alter the\nevaporation process outlined by Hawking. Thus a definitive theoretical\ntreatment will require an understanding of quantum gravity in at least some\nregimes. Until then, no compelling theoretical case for or against radiation by\nblack holes is likely to be made.\n  The possibility that non-radiating \"mini\" black holes exist should be taken\nseriously; such holes could be part of the dark matter in the Universe.\nAttempts to place observational limits on the number of \"mini\" black holes\n(independent of the assumption that they radiate) would be most welcome. \n\n"}

Thus\nwormhole horizons are two-way traversible, while black-hole and white-hole\nhorizons are only one-way traversible. It follows from the Einstein equation\nthat the null energy condition is violated everywhere on a generic wormhole\nhorizon. It is suggested that quantum inequalities constraining negative energy\nbreak down at such horizons. Wormhole dynamics can be developed as for\nblack-hole dynamics, including a reversed second law and a first law involving\na definition of wormhole surface gravity. Since the causal nature of a horizon\ncan change, being spatial under positive energy and temporal under sufficient\nnegative energy, black holes and wormholes are interconvertible.

After\nextending the standard construction of the Topological Yang-Mills theory to\nencompass the case of a non-vanishing vacuum expectation value for the scalar\nfield, a BRST transformation is defined (as a supersymmetry plus a gauge\nvariation), which on the instanton moduli space is the exterior derivative. The\ntopological field theory approach makes the so-called \"constrained instanton\"\nconfigurations and the instanton measure arise in a natural way. As a\nconsequence, instanton-dominated Green's functions in N=2 Super Yang-Mills can\nbe equivalently computed either using the constrained instanton method or\nmaking reference to the topological twisted version of the theory. We\nexplicitly compute the instanton measure and the contribution to $u=<\\Tr\n\\phi^2>$ for winding numbers one and two. We then show that each\nnon-perturbative contribution to the N=2 low-energy effective action can be\nwritten as the integral of a total derivative of a function of the instanton\nmoduli. Only instanton configurations of zero conformal size contribute to this\nresult. Finally, the 8k-dimensional instanton moduli space is built using the\nhyperkahler quotient procedure, which clarifies the geometrical meaning of our\napproach. \n\n"}

Thus the contracting universe goes through a\nnon-singular bounce and evolves smoothly into the expanding post big bang\nphase. The curvature perturbation acquires a scale-invariant spectrum well\nbefore the bounce in this scenario. It is sourced by the scale-invariant\nentropy perturbation engendered by two ekpyrotic scalar fields, a mechanism\nrecently proposed by Lehners et al. Since the background geometry is\nnon-singular at all times, the curvature perturbation remains nearly constant\non super horizon scales. It emerges from the bounce unscathed and imprints a\nscale-invariant spectrum of density fluctuations in the matter-radiation fluid\nat the onset of the hot big bang phase.

The relation can be proved in both the relativistic and\nthe non-relativistic domain (in fact for any symmetry group including internal\nsymmetries) without quantum field theory, by the requirement that the exchange\ncan be implemented smoothly by a class of symmetry transformations that project\nin the phase space of the joint system. We discuss the interpretation of this\nrequirement, stressing the fact that any distinction of identical particles\ncomes solely from the choice of coordinates. We then examine our construction\nin the geometric and the coherent-state-path-integral quantisation schemes. In\nthe appendix we apply our results to exotic systems exhibiting continuous\n``spin'' and ``fractional statistics''. This gives novel and unusual forms of\nthe spin-statistics relation. \n\n"}

When ${\\cal C}$ admits a complex structure, such\ncoherent states are globally defined on ${\\cal C}$.

The\nframework is sufficiently general to include systems with an infinite number of\ndegrees of freedom, including quantum fields. We show that a large number of\nstates in relativistic quantum field theory, including the vacuum state and\nthermal equilibrium states, are distillable over subsystems separated by\narbitrary spacelike distances. These results apply to any quantum field model.\nIt will also be shown that these results can be generalized to quantum fields\nin curved spacetime, leading to the conclusion that there is a large number of\nquantum field states which are distillable over subsystems separated by an\nevent horizon. \n\n"}

To obtain a finite spinor representation of the\nnon-compact homogeneous Lorentz group including Lorentz boosts, we introduce an\nindefinite inner product space (IIPS) with a normalized positive probability.\nIn this IIPS, the common momentum and common variable of a massive fermion turn\nout to be ``doubly strict plus-operators''. Due to this nice property, it is\nstraightforward to show an uncertainty relation between fermion mass and proper\ntime. Also in IIPS, the newly-defined Lagrangian operators are self-adjoint,\nand the fermion field equations are derivable from the Lagrangians. Finally,\nthe nonlinear QED equations and Lagrangians are presented as an example. \n\n"}

Recently, there has been work on\ndeveloping a consistent way of including constraints into the phase space path\nintegral that naturally arises in coherent state quantization. This new\napproach has many advantages over other approaches, including the lack of any\nGribov problems, the independence of gauge fixing, and the ability to handle\nsecond-class constraints without any ambiguous determinants. In this paper, I\nuse this new approach to study some examples of time reparameterization\ninvariant systems, which are of special interest in the field of quantum\ngravity. \n\n"}
