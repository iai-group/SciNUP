BAO are detected in the clustering of the combined 2dFGRS\nand SDSS main galaxy samples, and measure the distance--redshift relation at\nz=0.2.

The observed scale of the BAO calculated\nfrom these samples and from the combined sample are jointly analysed using\nestimates of the correlated errors, to constrain the form of the distance\nmeasure D_V(z)=[(1+z)^2D_A^2cz/H(z)]^(1/3).

The\nvelocity scale of thermal broadening and the Hubble flow across the gas Jeans\nscale are of similar magnitude (Hlambda_J ~ sigma_th). To separate the effects\nof gas pressure support and thermal broadening on the Lya forest, we compare\nspectra extracted from two smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations\nevolved with different photoionization heating rates (and thus different Jeans\nscales), imposing different temperature-density relations on the evolved\nparticle distributions. The turnover scales in the flux power spectrum and flux\nautocorrelation function are determined mainly by thermal broadening rather\nthan pressure. However, the insensitivity to pressure arises partly from a\ncancellation effect with a sloped temperature-density relation (T ~ rho^{0.6}\nin our simulations): the high density peaks in the colder, lower pressure\nsimulation are less smoothed by pressure support than in the hotter simulation,\nand it is this higher density gas that experiences the strongest thermal\nbroadening. Changes in thermal broadening and pressure support have comparably\nimportant effects on the flux probability distribution (PDF), which responds\ndirectly to the gas overdensity distribution rather than the scale on which it\nis smooth.

Hamiltonian dynamics for\nquadratic energy functions can be analytically solved. With the splitting\ntechnique, only the slowly-varying part of the energy needs to be handled\nnumerically, and this can be done with a larger stepsize (and hence fewer\nsteps) than would be necessary with a direct simulation of the dynamics.\nAnother context where splitting helps is when the most important terms of the\npotential energy function and its gradient can be evaluated quickly, with only\na slowly-varying part requiring costly computations.

Abstract: Following a simulation approach of recent publications we explore the\nviability of the neutrino-heating explosion mechanism in dependence on the\nspatial dimension. Our results disagree with previous findings. While we also\nobserve that two-dimensional (2D) models explode for lower driving neutrino\nluminosity than spherically symmetric (1D) models, we do not find that\nexplosions in 3D occur easier and earlier than in 2D. Moreover, we find that\nthe average entropy of matter in the gain layer hardly depends on the dimension\nand thus is no good diagnostic quantity for the readiness to explode. Instead,\nmass, integrated entropy, total neutrino-heating rate, and nonradial kinetic\nenergy in the gain layer are higher when models are closer to explosion.\nCoherent, large-scale mass motions as typically associated with the standing\naccretion-shock instability (SASI) are observed to be supportive for explosions\nbecause they drive strong shock expansion and thus enlarge the gain layer.\nWhile 2D models with better angular resolution explode clearly more easily, the\nopposite trend is seen in 3D. We interpret this as a consequence of the\nturbulent energy cascade, which transports energy from small to large spatial\nscales in 2D, thus fostering SASI activity. In contrast, the energy flow in 3D\nis in the opposite direction, feeding fragmentation and vortex motions on\nsmaller scales and thus making the 3D evolution with finer grid resolution more\nsimilar to 1D. More favorable conditions for explosions in 3D may therefore be\ntightly linked to efficient growth of low-order SASI modes including\nnonaxisymmetric ones. \n\n"}

There\nare many aspects of dynamical networks that require statistical considerations.\nIn this paper we focus on determining network structure. Estimating dynamic\nnetworks is a difficult task since the number of components involved in the\nsystem is very large. As a result, the number of parameters to be estimated is\nbigger than the number of observations. However, a characteristic of many\nnetworks is that they are sparse. For example, the molecular structure of genes\nmake interactions with other components a highly-structured and therefore\nsparse process.\n  Penalized Gaussian graphical models have been used to estimate sparse\nnetworks. However, the literature has focussed on static networks, which lack\nspecific temporal constraints.

Such models have\nlow electroweak fine-tuning and satisfy the LHC constraints. However, in the\ncontext of the MSSM, they predict too low a value of m(h), are frequently in\nconflict with the measured b\\to s\\gamma branching fraction and the relic\ndensity of thermally produced higgsino-like WIMPs falls well below dark matter\n(DM) measurements. We propose \"radiative natural SUSY\" (RNS) which can be\nrealized within the MSSM (avoiding the addition of extra exotic matter) and\nwhich maintains features such as gauge coupling unification and radiative\nelectroweak symmetry breaking. The RNS model can be generated from SUSY GUT\ntype models with non-universal Higgs masses (NUHM). Allowing for high scale\nsoft SUSY breaking Higgs mass m_{H_u}> m_0 leads to automatic cancellations\nduring renormalization group (RG) running, and to radiatively-induced low\nfine-tuning at the electroweak scale. Coupled with large mixing in the top\nsquark sector, RNS allows for fine-tuning at the 3-10% level with TeV-scale top\nsquarks and a 125 GeV light Higgs scalar h. The model allows for at least a\npartial solution to the SUSY flavor, CP and gravitino problems since\nfirst/second generation scalars (and the gravitino) may exist in the 10-30 TeV\nregime.

These techniques enable us to significantly reduce the\nsearch space by either greatly limiting the expansion scope of hubs (using the\nnovel distance- preserving Hub-Network concept) or completely pruning away the\nhubs in the online search (using the Hub2-Labeling approach). The\nHub-Accelerator approaches are more than two orders of magnitude faster than\nBFS and the state-of-the-art approximate shortest path method Sketch for the\nshortest path computation. The Hub- Network approach does not introduce\nadditional index cost with light pre-computation cost; the index size and index\nconstruction cost of Hub2-Labeling are also moderate and better than or\ncomparable to the approximation indexing Sketch method. \n\n"}

However, it is still not\nwell-understood; for example, existence of solutions to the conformal equations\nfor zero or negative Yamabe metrics is still unknown without the so-called\n``CMC'' or ``near-CMC'' assumptions. The first existence results without such\nassumptions, termed the ``far-from-CMC'' case, were obtained by Holst, Nagy,\nand Tsogtgerel in 2008 for positive Yamabe metrics. However, their results are\nbased on topological arguments, and as a result solution uniqueness is not\nknown. Indeed, Maxwell gave evidence in 2011 that far-from-CMC solutions are\nnot unique in certain cases. In this article, we provide further insight by\nestablishing a type of alternative theorem for general far-from-CMC solutions.\nFor a given manifold M that admits a metric of positive scalar curvature and\nscalar flat metric g(0) with no conformal Killing fields, we first prove\nexistence of an analytic, one-parameter family of metrics g(z) through g(0)\nsuch that R(g(z)) = z.

The\nregularity of this curve, the definition of F((phi,w),z), and the earlier\nfar-from-CMC results of Holst et al. allow us to then prove the following\nalternative theorem for far-from-CMC solutions: either (1) there exists a z_1\n>0 such that (positive Yamabe) solutions to the z_1-parameterized conformal\nequations are non-unique; or (2) there exists z_2 < 0 such that (negative\nYamabe) solutions to the z_2-parameterized conformal equations exist. \n\n"}

Like traditional event shapes, our observables are\ninfrared/collinear safe and involve a sum over all hadrons in an event, but\nlike a jet clustering algorithm, they incorporate a jet radius parameter and a\ntransverse momentum cut. Three of the ubiquitous jet-based observables---jet\nmultiplicity, summed scalar transverse momentum, and missing transverse\nmomentum---have event shape counterparts that are closely correlated with their\njet-based cousins. Due to their \"local\" computational structure, these jet-like\nevent shapes could potentially be used for trigger-level event selection at the\nLHC. Intriguingly, the jet multiplicity event shape typically takes on\nnon-integer values, highlighting the inherent ambiguity in defining jets. By\ninverting jet multiplicity, we show how to characterize the transverse momentum\nof the n-th hardest jet without actually finding the constituents of that jet.\nSince many physics applications do require knowledge about the jet\nconstituents, we also build a hybrid event shape that incorporates (local) jet\nclustering information.

{"id": "1404.3749", "contents": "Title: High-dimensional estimation with geometric constraints Abstract: Consider measuring an n-dimensional vector x through the inner product with\nseveral measurement vectors, a_1, a_2, ..., a_m. It is common in both signal\nprocessing and statistics to assume the linear response model y_i = <a_i, x> +\ne_i, where e_i is a noise term. However, in practice the precise relationship\nbetween the signal x and the observations y_i may not follow the linear model,\nand in some cases it may not even be known. To address this challenge, in this\npaper we propose a general model where it is only assumed that each observation\ny_i may depend on a_i only through <a_i, x>. We do not assume that the\ndependence is known. This is a form of the semiparametric single index model,\nand it includes the linear model as well as many forms of the generalized\nlinear model as special cases. We further assume that the signal x has some\nstructure, and we formulate this as a general assumption that x belongs to some\nknown (but arbitrary) feasible set K. We carefully detail the benefit of using\nthe signal structure to improve estimation. The theory is based on the mean\nwidth of K, a geometric parameter which can be used to understand its effective\ndimension in estimation problems. We determine a simple, efficient two-step\nprocedure for estimating the signal based on this model -- a linear estimation\nfollowed by metric projection onto K. We give general conditions under which\nthe estimator is minimax optimal up to a constant. This leads to the intriguing\nconclusion that in the high noise regime, an unknown non-linearity in the\nobservations does not significantly reduce one's ability to determine the\nsignal, even when the non-linearity may be non-invertible. Our results may be\nspecialized to understand the effect of non-linearities in compressed sensing. \n\n"}

C.c. pairs closest to the real axis, or\nthose that are ill-conditioned, attract most strongly and can collide to become\nexactly real. As an application we consider random perturbations of a fixed\nmatrix $M$. If $M$ is Normal, the total expected force on any eigenvalue is\nshown to be only the attraction of its c.c.

Although the conformal method is successful in\ngenerating constant mean curvature (CMC) solutions of the constraint equations,\nit is unknown how well it applies in the non-CMC setting, and there have been\nindications that it encounters difficulties there. We are therefore motivated\nto investigate alternative generalizations of the CMC conformal method.\n  Introducing a densitized lapse into the ADM Lagrangian, we find that\nsolutions of the momentum constraint can be described in terms of three\nparameters. The first is conformal momentum as it appears in the standard\nconformal method. The second is volumetric momentum, which appears as an\nexplicit parameter in the CMC conformal method, but not in the non-CMC\nformulation.

In this\npaper we present the predictions of the disc fragmentation model regarding the\nproperties of the discs around such low-mass objects. We find that the discs\naround objects that have formed by fragmentation in discs hosted by Sun-like\nstars (referred to as 'parent' discs and 'parent' stars) are more massive than\nexpected from the ${M}_{\\rm disc}-M_*$ relation (which is derived for stars\nwith masses $M_*>0.2 {\\rm M}_{\\odot}$). Accordingly, the accretion rates onto\nthese objects are also higher than expected from the $\\dot{M}_*-M_*$ relation.\nMoreover there is no significant correlation between the mass of the brown\ndwarf or planet with the mass of its disc nor with the accretion rate from the\ndisc onto it. The discs around objects that form by disc fragmentation have\nlarger than expected masses as they accrete gas from the disc of their parent\nstar during the first few kyr after they form. The amount of gas that they\naccrete and therefore their mass depend on how they move in their parent disc\nand how they interact with it.

We use a suite of halo\noccupation distribution (HOD) mocks in a simulation, identify voids in these\npopulations using the ZOBOV void finder and measure their abundances, sizes,\ntracer densities, and dark matter content. To separate the effects of bias from\nthose of sampling density, we do the same for voids traced by randomly\ndown-sampled subsets of the simulation dark matter particles. At the same\nsampling density, galaxy bias reduces the total number of voids by ~50% and can\ndramatically change their size distribution. The matter content of voids in\nbiased and unbiased tracers also differs. Deducing void properties from\nsimulation therefore requires the use of realistic galaxy mocks. We discuss how\nthe void observables can be related to their matter content. In particular we\nconsider the compensation of the total mass deficit in voids and find that the\ndistinction between over- and under-compensated voids is not a function of void\nsize alone, as has previously been suggested.

First of all, by analyzing the structure of the\nEinstein equations in wave coordinates, we exhibit a nonlinear\nwave-Klein-Gordon model defined on a curved background, which is the focus of\nthe present paper. For this model, we prove here the existence of\nglobal-in-time solutions to the Cauchy problem, when the initial data have\nsufficiently small Sobolev norms. A major difficulty comes from the fact that\nthe class of conformal Killing fields of Minkowski space is significantly\nreduced in presence of a massive scalar field, since the scaling vector field\nis not conformal Killing for the Klein-Gordon operator.

{"id": "1603.00935", "contents": "Title: Dynamics of Nonlinear Waves on Bounded Domains Abstract: This thesis is concerned with dynamics of conservative nonlinear waves on\nbounded domains. In general, there are two scenarios of evolution. Either the\nsolution behaves in an oscillatory, quasiperiodic manner or the nonlinear\neffects cause the energy to concentrate on smaller scales leading to a\nturbulent behaviour. Which of these two possibilities occurs depends on a model\nand the initial conditions. In the quasiperiodic scenario there exist very\nspecial time-periodic solutions. They result for a delicate balance between\ndispersion and nonlinear interaction. The main body of this dissertation is\nconcerned with construction (by means of perturbative and numerical methods) of\ntime-periodic solutions for various nonlinear wave equations on bounded\ndomains. While turbulence is mainly associated with hydrodynamics, recent\nresearch in General Relativity has also revealed turbulent phenomena. Numerical\nstudies of a self-gravitating massless scalar field in spherical symmetry gave\nevidence that anti-de Sitter space is unstable against black hole formation. On\nthe other hand there appeared many examples of asymptotically anti-de Sitter\nsolutions which evade turbulent behaviour and appear almost periodic for long\ntimes. We discuss here these two contrasting scenarios putting special\nattention to the construction and properties of strictly time-periodic\nsolutions. We analyze different models where solutions of this type exist.\nMoreover, we describe similarities and differences among these models\nconcerning properties of time-periodic solutions and methods used for their\nconstruction. \n\n"}

Among other important advantages, this approach simplifies\ngreatly the whole computation procedures both for coupled-channel $t$-matrix\nand the Brueckner reaction matrix. Therefore this principally novel scheme is\nexpected to be especially useful for self-consistent nuclear matter\ncalculations because it allows to accelerate in a high degree single-particle\npotential iterations. Furthermore the method provides direct access to the\nproperties of possible two-nucleon bound states in the nuclear medium.

Perna et al. (2016) proposed a novel evolutionary\nscenario of an accretion disc in BBHs in which a disc eventually becomes\n\"dead\", i.e., the magnetorotational instability (MRI) becomes inactive. In\ntheir scenario, the dead disc survives until {\\it a few seconds before} the\nmerger event. We improve the dead disc model and propose another scenario,\ntaking account of effects of the tidal torque from the companion and the\ncritical ionization degree for MRI activation more carefully. We find that the\nmass of the dead disc is much lower than that in the Perna's scenario. When the\nbinary separation sufficiently becomes small, the mass inflow induced by the\ntidal torque reactivates MRI, restarting mass accretion onto the black hole. We\nalso find that this disc \"revival\" happens {\\it more than thousands of years\nbefore} the merger. The mass accretion induced by the tidal torque increases as\nthe separation decreases, and a relativistic jet could be launched before the\nmerger.

In order to efficiently address the problem, this work first decomposes\nthe aging process into multiple short-term stages. Then, a novel generative\nprobabilistic model, named Temporal Non-Volume Preserving (TNVP)\ntransformation, is presented to model the facial aging process at each stage.\nUnlike Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which requires an empirical\nbalance threshold, and Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM), an intractable\nmodel, our proposed TNVP approach guarantees a tractable density function,\nexact inference and evaluation for embedding the feature transformations\nbetween faces in consecutive stages. Our model shows its advantages not only in\ncapturing the non-linear age related variance in each stage but also producing\na smooth synthesis in age progression across faces. Our approach can model any\nface in the wild provided with only four basic landmark points. Moreover, the\nstructure can be transformed into a deep convolutional network while keeping\nthe advantages of probabilistic models with tractable log-likelihood density\nestimation.

The main result of the article is optimal energy estimates. However,\nwe also derive asymptotics and demonstrate that the leading order asymptotics\ncan be specified.\n  It is sometimes argued that if the factors multiplying the spatial\nderivatives decay exponentially (for a system of wave equations), then the\nspatial derivatives can be ignored. This line of reasoning is incorrect: we\ngive examples of equations such that\n  1) the factors multiplying the spatial derivatives decay exponentially,\n  2) the factors multiplying the time derivatives are constants,\n  3) the energies of individual modes of solutions asymptotically decay\nexponentially, and\n  4) the energies of generic solutions grow as $e^{e^{t}}$ as $t\\rightarrow\n\\infty$.\n  When the factors multiplying the spatial derivatives grow exponentially, the\nFourier modes of solutions oscillate with a frequency that grows exponentially.\nTo obtain asymptotics, we fix a mode and consider the net evolution over one\nperiod.

In a series of papers, Christodoulou proved\nthat naked singularities are not stable in the context of the spherically\nsymmetric Einstein equations coupled with a massless scalar field. We study in\nthis paper the next simplest case: a characteristic initial value problem of\nthis coupled system with the initial data given on two intersecting null cones,\nthe incoming one of which is assumed to be spherically symmetric and singular\nat its vertex, and the outgoing one of which has no symmetries. It is shown\nthat, arbitrarily fixing the initial scalar field, the set of the initial\nconformal metrics on the outgoing null cone such that the maximal future\ndevelopment does not have any sequences of closed trapped surfaces approaching\nthe singularity, is of first category in the whole space in which the shear\ntensors are continuous. Such a set can then be viewed as exceptional, although\nthe exceptionality is weaker than the at least $1$ co-dimensionality in\nspherical symmetry. Almost equivalently, it is also proved that, arbitrarily\nfixing an incoming null cone $\\underline{C}_\\varepsilon$ to the future of the\ninitial incoming null cone, the set of the initial conformal metrics such that\nthe maximal future development has at least one closed trapped surface before\n$\\underline{C}_\\varepsilon$, contains an open and dense subset of the whole\nspace. Since the initial scalar field can be chosen such that the singularity\nis naked if the initial shear is set to be zero, we may say that the spherical\nnaked singularities of a self-gravitating scalar field are not stable under\ngravitational perturbations. This in particular gives new families of\nnon-spherically symmetric gravitational perturbations different from the\noriginal spherically symmetric scalar perturbations given by Christodoulou. \n\n"}

A transition domain (reaching null infinity)\nlimited by two asymptotic light cones is introduced in order to realize this\nmerging. On the one hand, we exhibit a boost-rotation hierarchy property (as we\ncall it) which is associated with Minkowski's Killing fields and is enjoyed by\ncommutators of curved wave operators and, on the other hand, we exhibit a\nmetric hierarchy property (as we call it) enjoyed by components of Einstein's\nfield equations in frames associated with our Euclidean-hyperboloidal\nfoliation. The core of the argument is, on the one hand, the derivation of\nnovel integral and pointwise estimates which lead us to almost sharp decay\nproperties (at timelike, null, and spacelike infinity) and, on the other hand,\nthe control of the (quasi-linear and semi-linear) coupling between the\ngeometric and matter parts of the Einstein equations. \n\n"}

In this article, we study the Cauchy problem and give a\nrigorous proof of this phenomenon in sufficiently high dimensions, thereby\nproviding the first constructive proof of stable curvature blowup (without\nsymmetry assumptions) along a spacelike hypersurface as an effect of pure\ngravity. Our proof applies to an open subset of regular initial data satisfying\nthe assumptions of Hawking's celebrated \"singularity\" theorem, which shows that\nthe solution is geodesically incomplete but does not reveal the nature of the\nincompleteness.

Summary statistic selection relies heavily on\ndomain knowledge and carefully engineered features, and can be a laborious time\nconsuming process. Since the method is sensitive to data dimensionality, the\nprocess of selecting summary statistics must balance the need to include\ninformative statistics and the dimensionality of the feature vector.

Recently\ndiscovered Lyman continuum (LyC) emitters have extremely high oxygen line\nratios: O32>4.

Combining data from several MUSE GTO\nprogrammes, we select a population of star-forming galaxies with bright\nemission lines, from which we draw 406 galaxies for our analysis based on their\nposition in the z-dependent star formation rate (SFR) - stellar mass (M*)\nplane. Out of this sample 15 are identified as extreme oxygen emitters based on\ntheir O32 ratios (3.7%) and 104 galaxies have O32>1 (26%). Our analysis shows\nno significant correlation between M*, SFR, and the distance from the SFR-M*\nrelation with O32. We find a decrease in the fraction of galaxies with O32>1\nwith increasing M*, however, this is most likely a result of the relationship\nbetween O32 and metallicity, rather than between O32 and M*. We draw a\ncomparison sample of local analogues with <z>~0.03 from SDSS, and find similar\nincidence rates for this sample. In order to investigate the evolution in the\nfraction of high O32 emitters with redshift, we bin the sample into three\nredshift subsamples of equal number, but find no evidence for a dependence on\nredshift. Furthermore, we compare the observed line ratios with those predicted\nby nebular models with no LyC escape and find that most of the extreme oxygen\nemitters can be reproduced by low metallicity models. The remaining galaxies\nare likely LyC emitter candidates. Finally, based on a comparison between\nelectron temperature estimates from the [OIII4363]/[OIII]5007 ratio of the\nextreme oxygen emitters and nebular models, we argue that the galaxies with the\nmost extreme O32 ratios have young light-weighted ages. \n\n"}

At this low level of regularity, the physical meaning of such\ngravitational metrics remains problematic.

In addition to the usual weak null\ncondition, we require a certain hierarchical structure in the semilinear terms.\nIncluded in this class are the Einstein equations in harmonic coordinates, so a\nspecial case of our results is a new proof of the stability of Minkowski space.\nOur proof also applies to the coupled Einstein-Maxwell system in harmonic\ncoordinates and Lorenz gauge, as well as to various model scalar wave equations\nwhich do not satisfy the null condition.

The first rigorous proof of the\ninstability of AdS in the simplest spherically symmetric setting, namely for\nthe Einstein-null dust system, was obtained in [G.

In that work, the evolution was restricted to the\nexterior of an inner mirror placed at $r=r_{0}>0$, in order to circumvent the\ntrivial break down of the Einstein-null dust system occurring at $r=0$; in that\nsetting, additional considerations necessitated $r_{0}$ to shrink to $0$ with\nthe size of the initial perturbation.\n  In this paper, we establish the instability of AdS for the Einstein-massless\nVlasov system in spherical symmetry.

Collisions transport heat inward,\nwhich produces a constant-density core, while continuous infall pumps energy\ninto the halo to stabilize the core against gravothermal catastrophe. These\nsolutions improve upon earlier attempts to model the formation and evolution of\nSIDM halos, offer deeper insight than existing N-body experiments, and yield a\nmore precise determination of the dependence of halo density profile on the\nvalue of the CDM self-interaction cross section. Different solutions arise for\ndifferent values of the dimensionless collisionality parameter Q = s rho_b r_v\n\\~ r_v/l_mfp, where s is the scattering cross section per unit mass, rho_b is\nthe cosmic mean matter density, r_v is halo virial radius and l_mfp is the\ncollision mean free path. The maximum flattening of central density occurs for\nan intermediate value of Q, Q_th, at which the halo is maximally relaxed to\nisothermality. The density profiles with constant-density cores preferred by\ndwarf and LSB rotation curves are best fit by the maximally-flattened (Q=Q_th)\nsolution. If we assume that dwarfs and LSB galaxies formed at their typical\ncollapse epoch in LCDM, then the value of s which makes Q=Q_th is s ~ 200\ncm^{2}/g, much higher than previous estimates, s ~ 0.5-5 cm^{2}/g, based on\nN-body experiments. If s is independent of collision velocity, then the same\nvalue s ~ 200 cm^{2}/g would make Q>Q_th for clusters, which typically formed\nonly recently, resulting in relatively less flattening of their central density\nprofile and a smaller core. \n\n"}

To test the various formation scenarios, we have conducted a\nphotometric survey of 55 open clusters in the southern sky.

If this is indeed the case, then the\nexplosion blast wave propagates into a complex density structure, composed of a\nstellar wind bounded by two shock waves - a wind reverse shock and a forward\nshock. As the explosion blast wave reaches R_0, the radius of the wind reverse\nshock, it splits into two shock waves - a reverse and a forward shock wave. We\nshow that the reverse shock thus produced is not strong, therefore full\nanalytical treatment is required in calculating its properties. We calculate\nthe dynamics of the flow and the evolution of the blast waves in all of the\ndifferent stages. We show that the fluid Lorentz factor at r>R_0 is equal to\n0.725 times the blast wave Lorentz factor as it reaches R_0, and is time (and\nr) independent as long as the blast wave reverse shock exists.

The data are drawn from the NOAO\nFundamental Plane Survey. Our adopted method is a generalization of that\nintroduced by Nelan et al. to determine the global age-mass and\nmetallicity-mass relations from the same survey. We find strong evidence for a\nchange in galaxy properties, at fixed mass, over a range from the cluster\ncentre to the virial radius, R_200. For example, red-sequence galaxies further\nout in the clusters have weaker Mgb5177 (at ~8 sigma significance) and stronger\nHbeta and Hgamma absorption (~3 sigma, ~4 sigma) than galaxies of the same\nvelocity dispersion in the cluster cores. The Fe5270 and Fe5335 indices show\nonly very weak trends with radius. Using a total of twelve indices, the pattern\nof cluster-centric gradients is considered in light of their different\ndependences on stellar age and chemical composition. The measured gradients for\nall twelve indices can be reproduced by a model in which red-sequence galaxies\nat ~1 R_200 have on average younger ages (by 15+/-4%) and lower alpha-element\nabundance ratios (by 10+/-2%), than galaxies of the same velocity dispersion\nbut located near the cluster centre.

The goal\nwould be to obtain a high enough density of sources to probe the\nthree-dimensional density field on the scale of the BAO feature. A\npercent-level measurement in this redshift range can almost double the Dark\nEnergy Task Force Figure of Merit, relative to the case with only a similar\nprecision measurement at z~1, if the Universe is not assumed to be flat. This\nimprovement is greater than the one obtained by doubling the size of the z~1\nsurvey, with Planck and a weak SDSS-like z=0.3 BAO measurement assumed in each\ncase. Galaxy BAO surveys at z~1 may be able to make an effective LyaF\nmeasurement simultaneously at minimal added cost, because the required number\ndensity of quasars is relatively small. We discuss the constraining power as a\nfunction of area, magnitude limit (density of quasars), resolution, and\nsignal-to-noise of the spectra.

Although Tereno stops short of finding the precise value\nof V at r=2M, he concludes that V <1.

Quasi-Spherical Spacetimes Abstract: We investigate the conditions under which cosmological variations in physical\n`constants' and scalar fields are detectable on the surface of local\ngravitationally-bound systems, such as planets, in non-spherically symmetric\nbackground spacetimes. The method of matched asymptotic expansions is used to\ndeal with the large range of length scales that appear in the problem. We\nderive a sufficient condition for the local time variation of the scalar fields\ndriving variations in 'constants' to track their large-scale cosmological\nvariation and show that this is consistent with our earlier conjecture derived\nfrom the spherically symmetric problem. We perform our analysis with spacetime\nbackgrounds that are of Szekeres-Szafron type. They are approximately\nSchwarzschild in some locality and free of gravitational waves everywhere. At\nlarge distances, we assume that the spacetime matches smoothly onto a Friedmann\nbackground universe. We conclude that, independent of the details of the\nscalar-field theory describing the varying `constant', the condition for its\ncosmological variations to be measured locally is almost always satisfied in\nphysically realistic situations. The very small differences expected to be\nobserved between different scales are quantified. This strengthens the proof\ngiven in our previous paper that local experiments see global variations by\ndropping the requirement of exact spherical symmetry. It provides a rigorous\njustification for using terrestrial experiments and solar system observations\nto constraint or detect any cosmological time variations in the traditional\n`constants' of Nature in the case where non-spherical inhomogeneities exist. \n\n"}

In our sector, below the\nscale f, these radiative corrections from the top quark are present but greatly\nweakened, naturally allowing a Z boson mass an order of magnitude below f, even\nwith a top squark mass of order 1 TeV and a messenger scale near the Planck\nmass. A sufficient quartic interaction for our Higgs boson arises from the\nusual gauge contribution together with a radiative contribution from a heavy\ntop squark. The mechanism requires the presence of an SU(2)-adjoint superfield,\nand can be simply unified. Naturalness in these theories is usually associated\nwith light winos and sleptons, and is largely independent of the scale of the\ncolored particles. The assumption of unification naturally predicts the\nexistence of many exotic fields.

We calculate and illustrate graphically populations of the collective\natomic states and the Wootters entanglement measure (concurrence) for two sets\nof initial atomic conditions. Our calculations include the dipole-dipole\ninteraction and a spatial separation between the atoms that the antisymmetric\nstate of the system is included throughout even for small interatomic\nseparations. It is shown that spontaneous emission can lead to a transient\nentanglement between the atoms even if the atoms were prepared initially in an\nunentangled state. We find that the ability of spontaneous emission to create\nthe transient entanglement relies on the absence of population in the\ncollective symmetric state of the system. For the initial state of only one\natom excited, the entanglement builds up rapidly in time and reaches a maximum\nfor the parameter values corresponding roughly to zero population in the\nsymmetric state. On the other hand, for the initial condition of both atoms\nexcited, the atoms remain unentangled until the symmetric state is depopulated.\nA simple physical interpretation of these results is given in terms of the\ndiagonal states of the density matrix of the system. We also study entanglement\ncreation in a system of two non-identical atoms of different transition\nfrequencies. It is found that the entanglement between the atoms can be\nenhanced compared to that for identical atoms, and can decay with two different\ntime scales resulting from the coherent transfer of the population from the\nsymmetric to the antisymmetric state. In addition, we find that a decaying\ninitial entanglement between the atoms can display a revival behaviour. \n\n"}

I: Principles Abstract: When light originating from a laser diode driven by non-fluctuating\nelectrical currents is incident on a photo-detector, the photo-current does not\nfluctuate much. Precisely, this means that the variance of the number of\nphoto-electrons counted over a large time interval is much smaller that the\naverage number of photo-electrons. At non-zero Fourier frequency $\\Omega$ the\nphoto-current power spectrum is of the form $\\Omega^2/(1+\\Omega^2)$ and thus\nvanishes as $\\Omega\\to 0$, a conclusion equivalent to the one given above. The\npurpose of this paper is to show that results such as the one just cited may be\nderived from a (semi-classical) theory in which neither the optical field nor\nthe electron wave-function are quantized. We first observe that almost any\nmedium may be described by a circuit and distinguish (possibly non-linear)\nconservative elements such as pure capacitances, and conductances that\nrepresent the atom-field coupling. The theory rests on the non-relativistic\napproximation. Nyquist noise sources (in which the Planck term $\\hbar\\omega/2$\nis being restored) are associated with positive or negative conductances, and\nthe law of average-energy conservation is enforced.
