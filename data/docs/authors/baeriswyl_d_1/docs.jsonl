Nevertheless, the efficiency most of them is still based on the\nfundamental physical phenomena, such as resonances. Thus, the understanding of\nthe resonance phenomena will be beneficial. One of the well-known examples is\nthe resonant enhancement of the transmission known as Breit-Wigner resonances,\nwhich can be described by a Lorentzian function. But, in many physical systems\nthe scattering of waves involves propagation along different paths, and, as a\nconsequence, results in interference phenomena, where constructive interference\ncorresponds to resonant enhancement and destructive interference to resonant\nsuppression of the transmission. Recently, a variety of experimental and\ntheoretical work has revealed such patterns in different branches of physics.\nThe purpose of this Review is to demonstrate that this kind of resonant\nscattering is related to the Fano resonances, known from atomic physics. One of\nthe main features of the Fano resonances is the asymmetric profile. The\nasymmetry comes from the close coexistence of resonant transmission and\nresonant reflection. Fano successfully explained such a phenomenon in his\nseminal paper in 1961 in terms of interaction of a discrete (localized) state\nwith a continuum of propagation modes. It allows to describe both resonant\nenhancement and resonant suppression in a unified manner. All of these\nproperties can be demonstrated in the frame of a very simple model, which will\nbe used throughout the Review to show that resonant reflections observed in\ndifferent complex systems are indeed closely related to the Fano resonances. \n\n"}

The dipolar scenario is also consistent with\nrecent neutron scattering measurements that find an ordered moment of 0.15 mu_B\nalong [001] and Q_n=pi((1+delta)/a,(1+delta)/a,1/c) with incommensuration delta\n= 0.12 for field H||[1-10].

We use a low-energy spin-fermion\nmodel and Eliashberg theory up to two-loop order.

Using the solution of the coupled equations, we find an onset of d-wave\npairing at Tc ~ 30 K, roughly three times larger than the one obtained\npreviously [P. Krotkov and A. Chubukov, Phys. Rev.

Consequently, by supplementing the Hamiltonian of\nthe SU(N) model with a perturbation Hamiltonian that removes the GS degeneracy,\nthe LT is to apply also for the SU(N) model in the limit of the coupling\nconstant, \\lambda, of this perturbation approaching zero, where the limit\n\\lambda --> 0 is clearly to be taken subsequent to taking the zero-temperature\nlimit of the thermal single-particle Green function in the expression for the\nLuttinger number N_L.

We\nalso review some of the physical implications of the latter result. Our\nconsiderations reveal that the interacting FS of a uniform metallic GS cannot\nbe calculated exactly to order \\nu (\\nu \\ge 2) in the coupling constant \\lambda\nof the interaction potential in terms of the self-energy calculated to order\n\\nu in a non-self-consistent fashion. We show this to be interlinked with the\nfailure of the Luttinger-Ward identity, and thus of the Luttinger theorem, for\na self-energy that is not appropriately related to the single-particle Green\nfunction from which the FS is deduced. We further show that the same mechanism\nthat embodies the Luttinger theorem within the framework of the exact theory,\naccounts for a non-trivial dependence of the exact self-energy on \\lambda that\ncannot be captured within a non-self-consistent framework.

The recent discovery of a Kerr effect\nusing near-IR light in the pseudogap phase of the cuprates can be regarded as a\nstrong evidence for a spontaneous symmetry breaking and the existence of an\nanomalous long-range ordered state. In this work we present a high precision\nstudy of the polarimetry properties of the cuprates in the THz regime. While no\nFaraday effect was found in this frequency range to the limits of our\nexperimental uncertainty (1.3 milli-radian or 0.07$^\\circ$), a small but\nsignificant polarization rotation was detected that derives from an anomalous\nlinear dichroism.

Defects often play a central role in ionic and electronic solids, not\nonly to limit reliability, but more importantly to enable the functionalities\nthat make these materials of critical importance. Examples include solid\nelectrolytes that conduct current through the motion of charged point defects,\nand complex oxide ferroelectrics that display multifunctionality through the\nmotion of domain wall defects. Therefore, it is important to understand the\nstructure of defects and their response to electrical and mechanical fields. A\ncentral hurdle, however, is that interactions in ionic solids include both\nshort-range atomic interactions as well as long-range electrostatic\ninteractions. Existing atomistic-to-continuum multi-scale methods, such as the\nQuasicontinuum method, are applicable only when the atomic interactions are\nshort-range. In addition, empirical reductions of quantum mechanics to density\nfunctional models are unable to capture key phenomena of interest in these\nmaterials. To address this open problem, we develop a multiscale atomistic\nmethod to coarse-grain the long-range electrical interactions in ionic crystals\nwith defects. In these settings, the charge density is rapidly varying, but in\nan almost-periodic manner. The key idea is to use the polarization density\nfield as a multiscale mediator that enables efficient coarse-graining by\nexploiting the almost-periodic nature of the variation. In regions far from the\ndefect, where the crystal is close-to-perfect, the polarization field serves as\na proxy that enables us to avoid accounting for the details of the charge\nvariation. We combine this approach for long-range electrostatics with the\nstandard Quasicontinuum method for short-range interactions to achieve an\nefficient multiscale atomistic-to-continuum method. \n\n"}

Moreover, the\nnon-trivial topology found in some insulators and superconductors has profound\nphysical implications that can be observed experimentally and can potentially\nbe used for applications. However, characterizing a system's topology is not\nalways a simple task, even for a theoretical model.

The goal of this paper is to\nsuggest alternatives to the topological invariants which are based on the\nentanglement spectrum and entanglement entropy. Using quadratic models of\nsuperconductors we demonstrate that these entanglement properties are sensitive\nto changes in topology.

Compared to the iron pnictides,\nthese systems have only electron Fermi pockets (i.e. no hole Fermi pockets) but\ncomparable superconducting transition temperatures. The challenge lies in\nreconciling the two basic experimental features of their superconducting state:\na node-less gap and the existence of a resonance in the spin excitation\nspectrum. We propose a mechanism based on reconstructing two quasi-degenerate\npairing states, one in an $s$-wave $A_{1g}$ channel that is fully gapped, and\nthe other in a $d$-wave $B_{1g}$ channel whose pairing function changes sign\nacross the electron Fermi pockets at the Brillouin-zone boundary. The resulting\nintermediate pairing state, which we call an orbital-selective $s \\times\n\\tau_3$ state, incorporates both of the above two properties. When the leading\nspin-singlet pairing is in the $d_{xz}, d_{yz}$ orbital subspace, this state\nretains the $s$-wave form factor but has a $B_{1g}$ symmetry due to an internal\n$\\tau_3$ structure in the orbital space.

The robust s-wave pairing throughout the different\nfamilies of iron-based superconductors at different doping regions signals two\nfundamental principles behind high T_c superconducting mechanisms: (1) the\ncorrespondence principle: the short range magnetic exchange interactions and\nthe Fermi surfaces act collaboratively to achieve high T_c superconductivity\nand determine pairing symmetries; (2) the magnetic selection pairing rule: the\nsuperconductivity is only induced by the magnetic exchange couplings from the\nsuperexchange mechanism through cation-anion-cation chemical bondings. These\nprinciples explain why the unconventional high T_c superconductivity appears to\nbe such a rare but robust phenomena with its strict requirement on electronic\nenvironment.

The electronic property of ZrTe5 is\ndominated by two branches of nearly-linear-dispersion bands at the Brillouin\nzone center. These two bands are separated by an energy gap that decreases with\ndecreasing temperature but persists down to the lowest temperature we measured\n(~2 K).

The\ncrossing point of temperature dependent magnetization curves measured at\ndifferent magnetic fields, which appears in many systems of cuprate\nsuperconductors and is regarded as indication of strong critical fluctuation,\nis however absent. The magnetization data can be scaled based on the\nGinzburg-Landau fluctuation theory for a quasi-two-dimensional system, but the\nscaling result cannot be described by the theoretical function of the\nfluctuation theory because of the limited fluctuation regions. The specific\nheat jump near $T_c$ is rather sharp without the trace of strong\nsuperconducting fluctuation.

It is\nshown that a two band model provides a consistent interpretation of the\ntemperature dependence of the normal state resistance and the Hall constant.\nWhereas band structure calculations suggest an increase in T_c upon partial\nsubstitution of Ni with Fe and Co, Co substitution quenches superconductivity\nand Fe substitution leads to an increase followed by a decrease in T_c. The\nobserved variation of T_c may be explained in terms of a competition between\nincrease in T_c due to increase in density of states and a decrease due to spin\nfluctuations. Based on these results, it is suggested that the spin\nfluctuations are weaker in Fe doped samples as compared to the Co doped ones.\nAn initial decrease in T_c (and the normal state resistance) followed by an\nincrease is observed on application of pressure.

The subsequent increase in T_c with pressure is due\nto a lattice softening or a structural phase transition, consistent with the\nband structure calculations.

The superconductor should be supercooled to T<T_c in the\nnormal phase under DC voltage. In such a nonequilibrium situation the NDC of\nthe superconductor is created by the excess conductivity of the fluctuation\nCooper pairs. We propose NDC of supercooled superconductors to be used as an\nactive medium for generation of electric oscillations. Such generators can be\nused in the superconducting electronics as a new type THz source of radiation.\nOscillations can be modulated by the change of the bias voltage, electrostatic\ndoping by a gate electrode when the superconductor is the channel of a field\neffect transistor, or by light. When small amplitude oscillations are\nstabilized near the critical temperature T_c the generator can be used as a\nbolometer. The essential for the applications NDC is predicted by the solution\nof the Boltzmann kinetic equation for the metastable in the normal phase Cooper\npairs. Boltzmann equation for fluctuation Cooper pairs is a result of\nstate-of-the-art application of the microscopic theory of superconductivity.\nOur theoretical conclusions are based on some approximations like time\ndependent Ginzburg-Landau theory, but nevertheless can reliably predict\nappearance of NDC.

Instead of relying on externally-induced flow or probe motion, we\nsuggest that colloidal diffusivity near solid surfaces contains signatures of\nthe degree of fluid slip exhibited on those surfaces. To investigate, we\ncalculate the image system for point forces (Stokeslets) oriented perpendicular\nand parallel to a surface with a finite slip length, analogous to Blake's\nsolution for a Stokeslet near a no-slip wall. Notably, the image system for the\npoint source and perpendicular Stokeslet contain the same singularities as\nBlake's solution; however, each is distributed along a line with a magnitude\nthat decays exponentially over the slip length. The image system for the\nparallel Stokeslet involves a larger set of fundamental singularities, whose\nmagnitude does not decay exponentially from the surface. Using these image\nsystems, we determine the wall-induced correction to the diffusivity of a small\nspherical particle located `far' from the wall.

It is based on enforcing conservation laws, the\nPauli principle and a number of crucial sum-rules. More specifically, spin and\ncharge susceptibilities are expressed, in a conserving approximation, as a\nfunction of two constant irreducible vertices whose values are found\nself-consistently. The Mermin-Wagner theorem in two dimensions is automatically\nsatisfied. The effect of collective modes on single-particle properties is then\nobtained by a paramagnon-like formula that is consistent with the two-particle\nproperties in the sense that the potential energy obtained from $Tr\\Sigma G$ is\nidentical to that obtained using the fluctuation-dissipation theorem for\nsusceptibilities. The vertex corrections are included through constant\nirreducible vertices. The theory is in quantitative agreement with Monte Carlo\nsimulations for both single-particle and two-particle properties. In the\ntwo-dimensional renormalized classical regime, spin fluctuations lead to\nprecursors of antiferromagnetic bands (shadow bands) and to the destruction of\nthe Fermi-liquid quasiparticles in a wide temperature range above the\nzero-temperature phase transition.

For the Hermitian ensemble, the PDE (in the boundary\npoints of the intervals) is related to the Toda lattice and the KP equation,\nwhereas for the symmetric and symplectic ensembles the PDE is an inductive\nequation, related to the so-called Pfaff-KP equation and the Pfaff lattice. The\nmethod consists of inserting time-variables in the integral and showing that\nthis integral satisfies integrable lattice equations and Virasoro constraints. \n\n"}

The Maxwell equations in passive (dispersive and absorptive) linear\nmedia are written in the form of the Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation to which the\nquantum mechanical resonant scattering theory (the Lippmann-Schwinger\nformalism) is applied. It is demonstrated that the existence of long-lived\nquasistationary eigenstates of the effective Hamiltonian for the Maxwell theory\nnaturally explains the extraordinary transmission properties observed in\nvarious nanostructured materials. Such states correspond to quasistationary\nelectromagnetic modes trapped in the scattering structure. Our general approach\nis also illustrated with an example of the zero-order transmission of the\nTE-polarized light through a metal-dielectric grating structure. Here a direct\non-the-grid solution of the time-dependent Maxwell equations demonstrates the\nsignificance of resonances (or trapped modes) for extraordinary light\ntransmissio \n\n"}

Our results show that its dynamics can be\ndescribed as the decoherence due to interaction with a composite bath\nconsisting of fully correlated and uncorrelated parts. The correlated term\ncauses the slower decay of coherence at larger times. The decoherence rate\nscales up as a square root of the number of spins giving the linear scaling of\nthe resulting error. Our theory is consistent with recent experiment reported\nin decoherence of correlated spin clusters. \n\n"}

The structure of these CPT-like states\ncorresponds to Cooper pairs with the total spin $S$=1. The found states have a\nhuge degree of degeneracy and carry a macroscopic magnetic moment, that allows\nus to construct a new model of the magnetism connected with the delocalized\nelectrons in metals (conductors). A principal possibility to apply the obtained\nresults to the superfluid $^3$He is also demonstrated. \n\n"}
