{"id": "0704.1447", "contents": "Title: Can Gravity Probe B usefully constrain torsion gravity theories? Abstract: In most theories of gravity involving torsion, the source for torsion is the\nintrinsic spin of matter. Since the spins of fermions are normally randomly\noriented in macroscopic bodies, the torsion generated is normally negligible.\nHowever, in a recent paper, Mao et al. point out that there is a class of\ntheories in which the angular momentum of macroscopic spinning bodies generates\na significant amount of torsion. They argue that by the principle of action\nequals reaction, one would expect the angular momentum of test bodies to couple\nto a background torsion field, and therefore the precession of the GPB\ngyroscopes should be affected in these theories by the torsion generated by the\nEarth. We show that in fact the principle of action equals reaction does not\napply to these theories. We examine in detail a generalization of the\nHayashi-Shirafuji theory suggested by Mao et al. called\nEinstein-Hayashi-Shirafuji theory. There are a variety of different versions of\nthis theory, depending on the precise form of the coupling to matter chosen for\nthe torsion. We show that for any coupling to matter that is compatible with\nthe spin transport equation postulated by Mao et al., the theory has either\nghosts or an ill-posed initial value formulation. These theoretical problems\ncan be avoided by specializing the parameters of the theory and in addition\nchoosing the standard minimal coupling to matter of the torsion tensor. This\nyields a consistent theory, but one in which the action equals reaction\nprinciple is violated, and in which the angular momentum of the gyroscopes does\nnot couple to the Earth's torsion field. Thus, the Einstein-Hayashi-Shirafuji\ntheory does not predict a detectable torsion signal for Gravity Probe B. There\nmay be other torsion theories which do. \n\n"}

And for a rotating (or\ncharged) black hole, it is also equidistant and independent of the angular\nmomentum $J$ (or charge $q$) when the black hole is far from the extremal case.\nIn this paper, we mainly deal with the area spectrum of the stringy charged\nGarfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger black hole, originating from effective action\nthat emerges in the low-energy string theory. We find that both methods give\nthe same results-that the area spectrum is equally spaced and does not depend\non the charge $q$. Our study may provide new insights into understanding the\narea spectrum and entropy spectrum for stringy black holes. \n\n"}

An universal criterion for the identification of this phenomenon in\nAbelian gauge theories is suggested: the so-called spontaneous breaking of the\nbrane symmetry. This local symmetry has its most common manifestation in the\nDirac string ambiguity present in the electromagnetic theory with monopoles.\nThe spontaneous breaking of the brane symmetry means that the Dirac string\nbecomes part of a brane invariant observable which hides the realization of\nsuch a symmetry and develops energy content in the confinement regime. The\nestablishment of this regime can be reached through the condensation of\ntopological defects. The effective theory of the confinement regime can be\nobtained with the Julia-Toulouse prescription which (originally introduced as\nthe dual mechanism to the Abelian Higgs Mechanism) is generalized in this paper\nin order to become fully compatible with Elitzur's theorem and describe more\ngeneral condensates which may break Lorentz and discrete spacetime symmetries.\nThis generalized approach for the condensation of defects is presented here\nthrough a series of different applications. \n\n"}

As a consequence, the unparticle picture proposed by\nGeorgi\\cite{georgi} is the natural candidate to describe such dynamics.\nUnparticle stuff is scale-invariant matter with no particular mass. Scale\ninvariance dictates that the propagator has an algebraic form which can admit\nzeros and hence is a candidate to explain the ubiquitous pseudogap state of the\ncuprates. The non-perturbative electronic state formed out of unparticles we\nrefer to as an un-Fermi liquid. We show that the underlying action of the\ncontinuous mass formulation of unparticles can be recast exactly as an action\nin anti de Sitter space. We find that this mapping fixes the scaling dimension\nof the unparticle to be $d_U=d/2+\\sqrt{d^2+4}/2$ and ensures that the\ncorresponding propagator has zeros with $d$ the spacetime dimension of the\nunparticle field. Should $d=2+1$, unparticles acquire the non-trivial phase\n$2\\pi d_U$ upon interchange.

We use these configurations as initial data and investigate their\nnumerical evolutions and energy decay. These dynamical solutions are the\nso-called \"Dirac dynamical resonance states\". It is found that the energy of\nthe Dirac dynamical resonance states shows an exponential decay. The decay rate\nof energy is affected by the resonant frequency, the mass of Dirac field, the\ntotal angular momentum, and the spin-orbit interaction. In particular, for\nultra-light Dirac field, the corresponding particles can stay around a\nSchwarzschild black hole for a very long time, even for cosmological\ntime-scales. \n\n"}

For the GSL to work,\nthe resulting increase in the black-hole surface area (entropy) must compensate\nfor the loss of the box's entropy. We show that if the box can be lowered\nadiabatically all the way down to the black-hole horizon, as previously assumed\nin the literature, then for near-extremal black holes the resulting increase in\nblack-hole surface-area (due to the assimilation of the box by the black hole)\nmay become too small to compensate for the loss of the box's entropy.

We specifically focus on\nthe effects of a parameter $\\phi_*$ that controls inflationary dynamics and the\nshape of the inflaton potential. For $\\phi_* < M_p$, the departure of the\ninflaton potential from the usual power-law behavior $\\phi^n$ significantly\nmodifies the microscopic behavior of the preheating dynamics. We analyze and\ncompare the efficiency of production, thermalization and the final equation of\nstate of the system for different models under consideration with $n=2,4,6$ for\ntwo different values of $\\phi_*$. Most importantly as we increase $n$, or\ndecrease $\\phi_*$, the preheating occurs very efficiently with the final\nequation of state to be that of the radiation, $w=1/3$. Specially for $n=2$,\nthe final equation of state turned out to be $w\\simeq 0.2$.

The parameters\nsuch as the mass and charge of the black hole, the cosmological constant, the\ncoefficient of the linear term from massive gravity $\\gamma$, and the mass of\nthe scalar are varied to study the behavior of the QNMs. We found the tower\npattern of the near-horizon quasinormal frequencies from the numerical results\nby AIM where the real parts depend only on product of the charge of the black\nhole and the scalar field and the imaginary parts depend only on the surface\ngravity.

We show that, surprisingly, the background\nintegral is numerically negligible for intermediate and high frequencies and,\nas a consequence, that the cross sections can be reconstructed in terms of\nRegge poles with very good agreement. We show in particular that, for large\nvalues of the scattering angle, a small number of Regge poles permits us to\ndescribe the black hole glory and that, by increasing the number of Regge\npoles, we can reconstruct very efficiently the differential scattering cross\nsections for small and intermediate scattering angles and therefore describe\nthe orbiting oscillations.

The seeds\nof discord are the fundamental principles on which these theories are grounded.\nGeneral relativity, on one hand, is based on the equivalence principle, whose\nstrong version establishes the local equivalence between gravitation and\ninertia. Quantum mechanics, on the other hand, is fundamentally based on the\nuncertainty principle, which is essentially nonlocal in the sense that a\nparticle does not follow one trajectory, but infinitely many trajectories, each\none with a different probability. This difference precludes the existence of a\nquantum version of the strong equivalence principle, and consequently of a\nquantum version of general relativity. Furthermore, there are compelling\nexperimental evidences that a quantum object in the presence of a gravitational\nfield violates the weak equivalence principle. Now it so happens that, in\naddition to general relativity, gravitation has an alternative, though\nequivalent description, given by teleparallel gravity, a gauge theory for the\ntranslation group. In this theory torsion, instead of curvature, is assumed to\nrepresent the gravitational field. These two descriptions lead to the same\nclassical results, but are conceptually different. In general relativity,\ncurvature geometrizes the interaction, while torsion in teleparallel gravity\nacts as a force, similar to the Lorentz force of electrodynamics.

We motivate and\nintroduce such an entropy functional for any vector field in terms of a\nfourth-rank divergence free tensor P_{ab}^{cd} with the symmetries of the\ncurvature tensor. Extremising this entropy for all the null surfaces then leads\nto equations for the background metric of the spacetime. When P_{ab}^{cd} is\nconstructed from the metric alone, these equations are identical to Einstein's\nequations with an undetermined cosmological constant (which arises as an\nintegration constant).

Abstract: It has been argued that a black hole horizon can support the long range\nfields of a Nielsen-Olesen string, and that one can think of such a vortex as\nblack hole ``hair''. In this paper, we examine the properties of an Abelian\nHiggs vortex in the presence of a charged black hole as we allow the hole to\napproach extremality. Using both analytical and numerical techniques, we show\nthat the magnetic field lines (as well as the scalar field) of the vortex are\ncompletely expelled from the black hole in the extreme limit. This was to be\nexpected, since extreme black holes in Einstein-Maxwell theory are known to\nexhibit such a ``Meissner effect'' in general. This would seem to imply that a\nvortex does not want to be attached to an extreme black hole. We calculate the\ntotal energy of the vortex fields in the presence of an extreme black hole.\nWhen the hole is small relative to the size of the vortex, it is energetically\nfavoured for the hole to remain inside the vortex region, contrary to the\nintuition that the hole should be expelled. However, as we allow the extreme\nhorizon radius to become very large compared to the radius of the vortex, we do\nfind evidence of an instability. This proves that it is energetically\nunfavourable for a thin vortex to interact with a large extreme black hole.\nThis would seem to dispel the notion that a black hole can support `long'\nabelian Higgs hair in the extreme limit.

In the\nstandard approach, with the light-front plane defined as $t+z=0$, this\nviolation of rotational invariance manifests by the fact that the energy\ndepends on the angular momentum projection on $z$-axis.\n  We present here a method to construct $J\\ne0$ states in the explicitly\ncovariant formulation of LFD and show how it leads to a restoration of\nrotational invariance. \n\n"}

The equations of motion in the bulk is solved using a low energy\nexpansion method. This allows us, through the junction conditions, to deduce\nthe effective equations of motion for the gravity on the brane. It is shown\nthat the gravity on the brane world is described by a quasi-scalar-tensor\ntheory with a specific coupling function omega(Psi) = 3 Psi / 2(1-Psi) on the\npositive tension brane and omega(Phi) = -3 Phi / 2(1+Phi) on the negative\ntension brane, where Psi and Phi are non-linear realizations of the radion on\nthe positive and negative tension branes, respectively.

The realization of the corresponding\ngenerators in terms of two boson currents is presented and it is shown to be\nrelated to many integrable models which are bi-Hamiltonian. We can also realize\nthose generators by adding extra currents, coupled in a particular way,\nallowing for instance a description of multi-layered Benney equations or\nmulti-component non-linear Schroedinger equation. In this case we can have a\nsecond Hamiltonian bracket structure which violates Jacobi identity. We\nconsider the reduction to one-boson systems leading to KdV and mKdV\nhierarchies. A Miura transformation relating these two hierarchies is obtained\nby restricting gauge transformation between corresponding two-boson\nhierarchies. Connection to Drinfeld-Sokolov approach is also discussed in the\n$SL(2,\\IR)$ gauge theory. (Lectures presented at the VII J.A.

This function vanishes, either on the real axis,\ncorresponding to bound states, or below it, corresponding to resonances. We\nfind potentials for which the resonances converge asymptotically toward the\naverage position of the Riemann zeros. These potentials realize, at the quantum\nlevel, the semiclassical regularization of H = x p proposed by Berry and\nKeating. Furthermore, a linear superposition of them, obtained by the action of\ninteger dilations, yields a Jost function whose real part vanishes at the\nRiemann zeros and whose imaginary part resembles the one of the zeta function.\nOur results suggest the existence of a quantum mechanical model where the\nRiemann zeros would make a point like spectrum embbeded in the continuum.

The Dirac equation, in the case of electromagnetic interaction,\nis not invariant under unitary time inversion, giving rise to a ``Klein\nparadox''. To render unitary time inversion invariance, a nonlinear wave\nequation is constructed, in which the ``Klein paradox'' disappears. In the case\nof Coulomb interaction, the revised nonlinear equation can be linearized to\ngive energy solutions for Hydrogen-like ions without singularity when nuclear\nnumber $Z>137$, showing a reversed energy order pending for experimental tests\nsuch as Zeeman effects. In non-relativistic limit, this nonlinear equation\nreduces to nonlinear schr\\\"odinger equation with soliton-like solutions.\nMoreover, particle conjugation and electron-proton scattering with a\nnonsingular current-potential interaction are discussed.

We reanalyze existing upper\nbounds on the reduction rate and conclude that all are compatible with such an\nincrease in $\\lambda$. The best bounds that we have obtained come from a\nconsideration of heating of the intergalactic medium (IGM), which shows that\n$\\lambda$ can be at most $\\sim 10^{8\\pm 1}$ times as large as the standard CSL\nvalue, again for $r_C=10^{-5} {\\rm cm}$.
