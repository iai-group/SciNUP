This topological Chern map provides a natural candidate for the\nexistence of a rational structure on the periodic cylic homology of a smooth\nproper dg-algebra, within the theory of noncommutative Hodge structures. The\ndefinition of topological K-theory consists in two steps : taking the\ntopological realization of algebraic K-theory, and inverting the Bott element.\nThe topological realization is the left Kan extension of the functor \"space of\ncomplex points\" to all simplicial presheaves over complex algebraic varieties.\nOur first main result states that the topological K-theory of the unit\ndg-category is the spectrum BU. For this we are led to prove a homotopical\ngeneralization of Deligne's cohomological proper descent, using Lurie's proper\ndescent.

{"id": "1502.03167", "contents": "Title: Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing\n  Internal Covariate Shift Abstract: Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the\ndistribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters\nof the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower\nlearning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously\nhard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this\nphenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing\nlayer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of\nthe model architecture and performing the normalization for each training\nmini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and\nbe less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some\ncases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image\nclassification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14\ntimes fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant\nmargin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the\nbest published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9% top-5\nvalidation error (and 4.8% test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters. \n\n"}

First, the bosonic partition function of\nprimes, or the generating function of unrestricted prime partitions in number\ntheory, is constructed. Next, the density of states is obtained using the\nsaddle-point method for Laplace inversion of the partition function in the\nlimit of large n. This directly gives the asymptotic number of prime partitions\nP_as(n). The leading term in the asymptotic expression grows exponentially as\nsqrt[n/ln(n)] and agrees with previous estimates.

Our\nselected prototype, the category Bmod of modules over the Boolean semifield B\nis the replacement for the category of abelian groups. We show that the\nsemi-additive category Bmod fulfills analogues of the axioms AB1 and AB2 for\nabelian categories. By introducing a precise comonad on Bmod we obtain the\nconceptually related Kleisli and Eilenberg-Moore categories. The latter\ncategory Bmod^s is simply Bmod in the topos of sets endowed with an involution\nand as such it shares with Bmod most of its abstract categorical properties.\nThe three main results of the paper are the following. First, when endowed with\nthe natural ideal of null morphisms, the category Bmod^s is a semi-exact,\nhomological category in the sense of M. Grandis.

Using modularity and level lowering\ntechniques, the problem can be reduced to the determination of the sets of\nrational points satisfying certain 2-adic and 3-adic conditions on a finite set\nof twists of the modular curve $X(p)$.\n  We first develop new local criteria to decide if two elliptic curves with\ncertain types of potentially good reduction at 2 and 3 can have symplectically\nor anti-symplectically isomorphic $p$-torsion modules. Using these criteria we\nproduce the minimal list of twists of $X(p)$ that have to be considered, based\non local information at 2 and 3; this list depends on $p \\bmod 24$. Recent\nresults on mod $p$ representations with image in the normalizer of a split\nCartan subgroup allow us to reduce the list further in some cases.\n  Our second main result is the complete solution of the equation when $p =\n11$, which previously was the smallest unresolved $p$. One relevant new\ningredient is the use of the `Selmer group Chabauty' method introduced by the\nthird author in recent work, applied in an Elliptic Curve Chabauty context, to\ndetermine relevant points on $X_0(11)$ defined over certain number fields of\ndegree 12. This result is conditional on GRH, which is needed to show\ncorrectness of the computation of the class groups of five specific number\nfields of degree 36.\n  We also give some partial results for the case $p = 13$. \n\n"}

The \"Beyond Endoscopy\"\nproposal predicts that this transfer will be realized as a comparison between\nthe (relative) trace formulas of these spaces.\n  In this paper we establish the local transfer for the identity map between\nL-groups, for spherical affine homogeneous spaces X=H\\G whose dual group is\nSL(2) or PGL(2) (with G and H split). More precisely, we construct a transfer\noperator between orbital integrals for the (X x X)/G-relative trace formula,\nand orbital integrals for the Kuznetsov formula of PGL(2) or SL(2). Besides the\nL-group, another invariant attached to X is a certain L-value, and the space of\ntest measures for the Kuznetsov formula is enlarged, to accommodate the given\nL-value.\n  The fundamental lemma for this transfer operator is proven in a forthcoming\npaper of Johnstone and Krishna. The transfer operator is given explicitly in\nterms of Fourier convolutions, making it suitable for a global comparison of\ntrace formulas by the Poisson summation formula, hence for a uniform proof, in\nrank one, of the relations between periods of automorphic forms and special\nvalues of L-functions. \n\n"}

Res. Lett., 1995) which asserts that for certain values of r\nthe space of r-overconvergent p-adic modular forms of tame level N and weight k\nshould be spanned by the finite slope Hecke eigenforms. Using methods adapted\nfrom the work of Buzzard and Calegari I show that for p=2, k = 0, N = 1, this\nholds for all r in (5/12, 7/12). The proof relies on a certain factorisation of\nthe U_p operator which is known in this case but I conjecture also holds for p\n= 3 and 5; this conjecture also implies exact formulae for the set of slopes\nsimilar to those proved for p=2 by Buzzard and Calegari.\n  The same methods also provide an efficient approach to explicit computations\nof q-expansions of small slope overconvergent eigenforms, extending the\ncomputations of Gouvea and Mazur. \n\n"}
