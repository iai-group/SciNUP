Some theoretical\nestimates for the cores of relaxed clusters predict an excess of helium\nabundance by up to a factor of a few over its primordial value. The\nintracluster helium abundance cannot be measured directly. This presents a\nsignificant source of uncertainty for cosmological tests based on the X-ray\nderived cluster quantities, such as the gas mass, total mass, and gas mass\nfraction, all of which depend on the assumed helium abundance. We point out\nthat cluster distances derived by combining the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) and\nX-ray data also depend on the helium abundance. This dependence can be used to\nmeasure the abundance, provided the distance is known independently. For\nexample, if one adopts the WMAP H_0 value, then the recent H_0 measurement by\nBonamente and collaborators, derived from SZ data on 38 clusters assuming a\nprimordial helium abundance, corresponds to an abundance excess by a factor of\n1.9+-0.8 within r~1 Mpc (using only their statistical errors). This shows that\ninteresting accuracy is within reach.

However, this line of argumentation\nrelies implicitly on the assumption of a relatively homogeneous CR source\ndistribution. Inhomogeneity of CR sources on a scale of order a kpc, can\nnaturally explain this anomaly. If the nearest major CR source is about a kpc\naway, then low energy electrons (~GeV) can easily reach us. At higher energies\n(> 10 GeV), the source electrons cool via synchrotron and inverse-Compton\nbefore reaching the solar vicinity. Pairs formed in the local vicinity through\nthe proton/ISM interactions can reach the solar system also at high energies,\nthus increasing the positron/electron ratio. A natural origin of source\ninhomogeneity is the strong concentration of supernovae to the galactic spiral\narms. Assuming supernova remnants (SNRs) as the sole primary source of CRs, and\ntaking into account their concentration near the galactic spiral arms, we\nconsistently predict the observed positron fraction between 1 and 100 GeV,\nwhile abiding to different constraints such as the observed electron spectrum\nand the CRs cosmogenic age. An ATIC like spectral excess at ~600 GeV can be\nexplained, in this picture, as the contribution of a few known nearby SNRs. \n\n"}

The Suzaku spectrum exhibits highly\nstatistically significant absorption features near 9 keV in the quasar\nrest--frame.

This indicates that a highly ionized outflow may be present\nmoving at near relativistic velocities (~0.25c). A possible hard X-ray excess\nis detected above 15 keV with HXD (at 99.8% confidence), which may arise from\nhigh column density gas (Nh>10^24cm^-2) partially covering the X-ray emission,\nor through strong Compton reflection.

It is generally expected that as density increases,\nthe electron chemical potential will increase and new degrees of freedom will\nemerge as mu_e becomes comparable to their energy scales. Assuming the\nelectrical neutrality and beta equilibrium for the stellar matter, we have\nstudied how the density dependence of lepton chemical potentials varies for\ndifferent models of nuclear interactions that are constrained by experiments up\nto nuclear matter density, n_0, but extrapolate differently(unconstrained)\nbeyond n_0 and calculated the relative abundances of nucleons(neutron and\nproton) and leptons(electron and muon) and their density dependencies. We find\nthat the density dependence of the electron chemical potential is strongly\ndependent on the structure of the nuclear symmetry energy relevant to\nsoftness/stfness of the nuclear matter EOS that measures the energy relevant to\nthe neutron-proton asymmetry. As a consequence, the relative abundances of\nneutrons, protons, electrons, and muons as well as the kaon condensation are\nstrongly dependent on the nuclear symmetry energy. An intriguing result in our\nfinding is that contrary to the accepted lore, kaon condensation in neutron\nstar matter, which is considered to be the first phase transitions beyond n_0\nand plays a crucial role in certain scenarios of compact-star formation, is not\ndirectly tied to the softness or stiffness of the EOS beyond n_0.

We find bursts with a wide variety of characteristics in\nserendipitous wide-field X-ray observations by EURECA/WATCH, RXTE/ASM,\nBeppoSAX/WFC, HETE-2/FREGATE, INTEGRAL/IBIS/ISGRI, and Swift/BAT, as well as\npointed observations by RXTE/PCA and HEXTE. Most of them reach a peak flux of\n~15 Crab, but a few only reach a peak flux below a Crab. One of the bursts\nshows a very strong photospheric radius-expansion phase. This allows us to\nevaluate the distance to the source: 3.2 kpc. The burst durations are between\n10 sec to 5 min. However, after one of the intermediate-duration bursts, a\nfaint tail is seen to at least ~2.4 hours after the start of the burst. One\nvery long burst lasted for several hours. This superburst candidate was\nfollowed by a normal type-I burst only 19 days later. This is, to our\nknowledge, the shortest burst-quench time among the superbursters. A superburst\nin this system is difficult to reconcile if it accretes at ~1% L_Edd. The\nintermediate-duration bursts occurred when 4U 0614+091's persistent emission\nwas lowest and calm, and when bursts were infrequent (on average one every\nmonth to 3 months). The average burst rate increased significantly after this\nperiod. The maximum average burst recurrence rate is once every week to 2\nweeks. The burst behaviour may be partly understood if there is at least an\nappreciable amount of helium present in the accreted material from the donor\nstar. If the system is an ultra-compact X-ray binary with a CO white-dwarf\ndonor, as has been suggested, this is unexpected. If the bursts are powered by\nhelium, we find that the energy production per accumulated mass is about 2.5\ntimes less than expected for pure helium matter. \n\n"}

The peak absolute magnitude of SN 2008iy was M_r\n~ -19.1 mag, and the total radiated energy over the first ~700 days was ~2 x\n10^50 erg. Spectroscopically, SN 2008iy is very similar to the Type IIn SN\n1988Z at late times, and, like SN 1988Z, it is a luminous X-ray source (both\nsupernovae had an X-ray luminosity L_ X > 10^41 erg/s). The Halpha emission\nprofile of SN 2008iy shows a narrow P Cygni absorption component, implying a\npre-SN wind speed of ~100 km/s. We argue that the luminosity of SN 2008iy is\npowered via the interaction of the SN ejecta with a dense, clumpy circumstellar\nmedium. The ~400 day rise time can be understood if the number density of\nclumps increases with distance over a radius ~1.7 x 10^16 cm from the\nprogenitor.

Abstract: Fifty archival radio observations of the supergiant binary Cyg OB2 #5 using\nthe Very Large Array over 20 years are re-examined to determine the location\nand character of the previously detected variable radio emission. The radio\nemission from the system consists of a primary component that is associated\nwith the binary, and a non-thermal source (NE) that has been ascribed to a\nwind-collision region (WCR) between the stellar winds of the binary and that of\na B-type star (Star D) to the NE. NE shows no evidence of variation in 23\nepochs where it is resolved separately from the primary radio component,\ndemonstrating that the variable emission arises in the primary. Since NE is\nnon-variable, the radio flux from the primary can now be well determined for\nthe first time, most especially in observations that do not resolve both the\nprimary and NE components. The variable radio emission from the primary has a\nperiod of 6.7+/-0.3 years which is described by a simple model of a non-thermal\nsource orbiting within the stellar wind envelope of the binary. Such a model\nimplies the presence of a third, unresolved stellar companion (Star C) orbiting\nthe 6.6-day binary with a period of 6.7 years. The variable non-thermal\nemission arises from either a WCR between Star C and the binary system, or\npossibly from Star C directly. The model gives a mass-loss rate of 3.4 x\n10^{-5} solar mass/yr for Cyg OB2 #5, unusually high for an Of supergiant and\ncomparable to that of WR stars, and consistent with an unusually strong He I\n1.083-micron emission line, also redolent of WR stars. An examination of radial\nvelocity observations suggests reflex motion of the binary due to Star C. The\nnatures of NE and Star D are also examined. (abridged) \n\n"}

However, none is\ndesigned to simultaneously explain the presence of powerful jets detected\nduring these states. A new quasi-keplerian hot accretion disc solution, a Jet\nEmitting disc (JED hereafter), which is part of a global disc-jet MHD structure\nproducing stationary super-alfv\\'enic ejection, is investigated here. Its\nradiative and energetic properties are then compared to the observational\nconstraints found in Cygnus X-1. We solve the disc energy equation by balancing\nthe local heating term with advection and cooling by synchrotron,\nbremsstrahlung and Comptonization processes. The heating term, disc density,\naccretion velocity and magnetic field amplitude were taken from published\nself-similar models of accretion-ejection structures. Both optically thin and\nthick regimes are considered in a one temperature gas supported disc. Three\nbranches of solutions are found possible at a given radius but we investigate\nonly the hot, optically thin and geometrically slim solutions.

Consistent with the\npowerful, high-z giant radio galaxies we have studied previously, X-rays seem\nto be invariably found where the lobe plasma is oldest even where the radio\nemission has long since faded. The hotspot complexes seem to show structures\nresembling the double shock structure exhibited by the largest radio quasar\n4C74.26, with the X-ray shock again being offset closer to the nucleus than the\nradio synchrotron shock. In the current paper, the offsets between these shocks\nare even larger at 35kpc.

In this survey we consider a\nlogical formalism from each of the above possibilities, namely Reiter's default\nlogic, Moore's autoepistemic logic and McCarthy's circumscription.\nAdditionally, we consider abduction, where one is not interested in inferences\nfrom a given knowledge base but in computing possible explanations for an\nobservation with respect to a given knowledge base.\n  Complexity results for different reasoning tasks for propositional variants\nof these logics have been studied already in the nineties. In recent years,\nhowever, a renewed interest in complexity issues can be observed. One current\nfocal approach is to consider parameterized problems and identify reasonable\nparameters that allow for FPT algorithms. In another approach, the emphasis\nlies on identifying fragments, i.e., restriction of the logical language, that\nallow more efficient algorithms for the most important reasoning tasks. In this\nsurvey we focus on this second aspect.

{"id": "1010.3770", "contents": "Title: Explosions Triggered by Violent Binary-Star Collisions: Application to\n  Eta Carinae and other Eruptive Transients Abstract: This paper discusses a model where a violent periastron collision of stars in\nan eccentric binary system induces an eruption or explosion seen as a brief\ntransient source, attributed to LBVs, SN impostors, or other transients. The\nkey ingredient is that an evolved primary increases its photospheric radius on\nrelatively short timescales, to a point where the radius is comparable to or\nlarger than the periastron separation in an eccentric binary. In such a\nconfiguration, a violent and sudden collision would ensue, possibly leading to\nsubstantial mass ejection instead of a binary merger. Repeated periastral\ngrazings in an eccentric system could quickly escalate to a catastrophic\nencounter, wherein the companion star actually plunges deep inside the\nphotosphere of a bloated primary during periastron, as a result of the primary\nstar increasing its own radius. This is motivated by the case of $\\eta$\nCarinae, where such a collision must have occured if conventional estimates of\nthe present-day orbit are correct, and where brief peaks in the light curve\ncoincide with periastron. Stellar collisions may explain brief recurring LBV\noutbursts like SN 2000ch and SN 2009ip, and perhaps outbursts from relatively\nlow-mass progenitor stars (collisons are not necessarily the exclusive domain\nof very luminous stars). Finally, mass ejections induced repeatedly at\nperiastron cause orbital evolution; this may explain the origin of very\neccentric colliding-wind Wolf-Rayet binaries such as WR140. \n\n"}

Using multi-band photometry from GROND and\nSwift/UVOT, photo-zs are derived for five GRBs for which spectroscopic\nredshifts are not available. We use UV/optical/NIR data and synthetic\nphotometry based on afterglow observations and theory to derive the photometric\nredshifts of GRBs and their accuracy. Taking into account the afterglow\nsynchrotron emission properties, we investigate the application of photometry\nto derive redshifts in a theoretical range between z~1 and z~12. The\nmeasurement of photo-zs for GRB afterglows provides a quick, robust and\nreliable determination of the distance scale to the burst, particularly in\nthose cases where spectroscopic observations in the optical/NIR range cannot be\nobtained. Given a sufficiently bright and mildly reddened afterglow, the\nrelative photo-z accuracy is better than 10% between z=1.5 and z~7 and better\nthan 5% between z=2 and z=6. We detail the approach on 5 sources without\nspectroscopic redshifts observed with UVOT on-board Swift and/or GROND. The\ndistance scale to those same afterglows is measured to be\n$z=4.31^{+0.14}_{-0.15}$ for GRB 080825B, $z=2.13^{+0.14}_{-0.20}$ for GRB\n080906, $z=3.44^{+0.15}_{-0.32}$ for GRB 081228, $z=2.03^{+0.16}_{-0.14}$ for\nGRB 081230 and $z=1.28^{+0.16}_{-0.15}$ for GRB 090530.

Such a high T_R\nvalue typically leads to an overproduction of gravitinos in the early universe,\nwhich will cause conflicts, mainly with BBN constraints.

We calculate the relic\nabundance of mixed axion/axino dark matter in the AY scenario, and investigate\nunder what conditions a value of T_R sufficient for thermal leptogenesis can be\ngenerated.

We find the\noptical/IR time variability properties of these blazars to be remarkably\nsimilar to those at the gamma-ray energies. The power spectral density (PSD)\nfunctions of the R-band variability of all six blazars are fit well by simple\npower-law functions with negative slope such that there is higher amplitude\nvariability on longer timescales. No clear break is identified in the PSD of\nany of the sources. The average slope of the PSD of R-band variability of these\nblazars is similar to what was found by the Fermi team for the gamma-ray\nvariability of a larger sample of bright blazars. This is consistent with\nleptonic models where the optical-IR and gamma-ray emission is generated by the\nsame population of electrons through synchrotron and inverse-Compton processes,\nrespectively. The prominent flares present in the optical-IR as well as the\ngamma-ray light curves of these blazars are predominantly symmetric, i.e., have\nsimilar rise and decay timescales, indicating that the long-term variability is\ndominated by the crossing time of radiation or a disturbance through the\nemission region rather than by the acceleration or energy-loss timescales of\nthe radiating electrons.

Both phenomena will imprint signatures about the stellar structure in the\nemitted gravitational radiation. The information from the disruption, however,\nis confined to very high frequencies, where detectors are not very sensitive.\nWe thus assess whether the lack of tidal distortion corrections in\ndata-analysis pipelines will affect the detection of the inspiral part of the\nsignal and whether these may yield information on the equation of state of\nmatter at nuclear densities.

Abstract: A few long gamma-ray bursts such as GRB 050421 show no afterglow emission\nbeyond the usual initial steep decay phase. It has been suggested that these\nevents correspond to \"naked\" bursts that occur in a very low density\nenvironment. We reconsider this possibility in the context of various scenarios\nfor the origin of the afterglow. In the standard model where the afterglow\nresults from the forward shock as well as in the alternative model where the\nafterglow comes from the reverse shock, we aim to obtain constraints on the\ndensity of the environment, the microphysics parameters, or the Lorentz factor\nof the ejecta, which are imposed by the absence of a detected afterglow. For\nthe two models we compute the afterglow evolution for different values of the\nexternal density (uniform or wind medium) and various burst parameters. We then\ncompare our results to the Swift data of GRB 050421, which is the best example\nof a long burst without afterglow. In the standard model we show that\nconsistency with the data imposes that the external density does not exceed\n1E-5 cm-3 or that the microphysics parameters are very small with epsilon_e <~\n1E-2 and epsilon_B <~ 1E-4. If the afterglow is caused by the reverse shock, we\nfind that its contribution can be strongly reduced if the central source has\nmainly emitted fast-moving material (with less than 10 - 30 % of the kinetic\nenergy at Gamma<100 and was located in a dense environment. The two considered\nscenarios therefore lead to opposite constraints on the circumburst medium. The\nhigh-density environment, favored by the reverse shock model, better\ncorresponds to what is expected if the burst progenitor was a massive star. \n\n"}

Here we discuss two such relations: the\nlag-luminosity relation and the newly discovered duration-luminosity relation\nof GRB pulses. We aim to extend our previous work on the origin of spectral\nlags, using the duration-luminosity relation recently discovered by Hakkila et\nal. to connect lags and luminosity. We also present a way to test this relation\nwhich has originally been established with a limited sample of only 12 pulses.\nWe relate lags to the spectral evolution and shape of the pulses with a linear\nexpansion of the pulse properties around maximum. We then couple this first\nresult to the duration-luminosity relation to obtain the lag-luminosity and\nlag-duration relations. We finally use a Monte-Carlo method to generate a\npopulation of synthetic GRB pulses which is then used to check the validity of\nthe duration-luminosity relation. Our theoretical results for the lag and\nduration-luminosity relations are in good agreement with the data. They are\nrather insensitive to the assumptions regarding the burst spectral parameters.\nOur Monte Carlo analysis of a population of synthetic pulses confirms that the\nduration-luminosity relation must be satisfied to reproduce the observational\nduration-peak flux diagram of BATSE GRB pulses. The newly discovered\nduration-luminosity relation offers the possibility to link all three\nquantities: lag, duration and luminosity of GRB pulses in a consistent way.\nSome evidence for its validity have been presented but its origin is not easy\nto explain in the context of the internal shock model. \n\n"}

However a major uncertainty is the estimate of the orbital\ninclination angle of an X-ray binary. Here we suggest to measure the black hole\nmass in an X-ray binary by measuring directly the black hole's orbital motion,\nthus obtaining the companion to black hole mass ratio. In this method we assume\nthat accretion disk wind moves with the black hole and thus the black hole's\norbital motion can be obtained from the Doppler velocity of the absorption\nlines produced in the accretion disk wind. We validate this method by analyzing\nthe Chandra/HETG observations of GRO J1655-40, in which the black hole orbital\nmotion with line of sight velocity of 90.8 (+-11.3) km/s, inferred from the\nDoppler velocity of disk-wind absorption lines, is consistent with the\nprediction from its previously measured system parameters.

For the cascade emission, we consider two possible\ncontributions: one is due to that the flux of the cascade emission is lower\nthan the Fermi LAT sensitivity (case I), which is independent on the\nextragalactic magnetic field (EGMF), another is due to the fact that the flux\nof the cascade emission is larger than the Fermi LAT sensitivity but the\nemission angle is larger than LAT point-spread-function (PSF) angle (case II),\nwhich depends on the EGMF.

In\nthis paper we parametrize the WGS on the basis of a single parameter s that we\nthen use to determine if gamma-ray Active Galactic Nuclei of the uncertain type\n(AGUs) detected by Fermi are consistent with the WGS and so can be considered\nblazar candidates. We find that 54 AGUs out of a set 60 analyzed have IR colors\nconsistent with the WGS; only 6 AGUs are outliers. This result implies that a\nvery high percentage (i.e., in this sample about 90%) of the AGUs detected by\nFermi are indeed blazar candidates. \n\n"}

This in turn implied that the\nneutrino driven wind is proton rich during its entire life, precluding\n$r$-process nucleosynthesis and the synthesis of Sr, Y, and Zr. This work\nrelied on charged current neutrino interaction rates that are appropriate for a\nfree nucleon gas. Here, it is shown in detail that the inclusion of the nucleon\npotential energies and collisional broadening of the response significantly\nalters this conclusion. Iso-vector interactions, which give rise to the nuclear\nsymmetry energy, produce a difference between the neutron and proton\nsingle-particle energies $\\Delta U=U_n-U_p$ and alter the kinematics of the\ncharged current reactions. In neutron-rich matter, and for a given\nneutrino/antineutrino energy, the rate for $\\nu_e+n\\rightarrow e^-+p$ is\nenhanced while $ \\bar{\\nu}_e+p\\rightarrow n+e^+$ is suppressed because the $Q$\nvalue for these reactions is altered by $\\pm\\Delta U$, respectively.

Therefore, electron neutrinos decouple at lower\ntemperature than when the nucleons are assumed to be free and have lower\naverage energies.

The gas in\nthese galaxies is not in perfect hydrostatic equilibrium. Supernova feedback,\nstellar winds, or active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback can significantly\nperturb the interstellar medium (ISM). Using hydrodynamical simulations, we\ninvestigate the effect of subsonic turbulence in the hot ISM on the ram\npressure stripping process in early-type galaxies. We find that galaxies with\nmore turbulent ISM produce longer, wider, and more smoothly distributed tails\nof the stripped ISM than those characterised by weaker ISM turbulence. Our main\nconclusion is that even very weak internal turbulence, at the level of <15% of\nthe average ISM sound speed, can significantly accelerate the gas removal from\ngalaxies via ram pressure stripping. The magnitude of this effect increases\nsharply with the strength of turbulence. As most of the gas stripping takes\nplace near the boundary between the ISM and the intraclustermedium (ICM), the\nboost in the ISM stripping rate is due to the \"random walk\" of the ISM from the\ncentral regions of the galactic potential well to larger distances, where the\nram pressure is able to permanently remove the gas from galaxies.

In this work, we\ninvestigate 14-195 keV spectra from the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT)\nall-sky survey for evidence of non-thermal excess emission above the\nexponentially decreasing tail of thermal emission in the flux-limited HIFLUGCS\nsample. To account for the thermal contribution at BAT energies, XMM-Newton\nEPIC spectra are extracted from coincident spatial regions so that both thermal\nand non-thermal spectral components can be determined simultaneously.

Assuming that the observed MIR\nemission is radiation from an accretion disk reprocessed in a surrounding dusty\ntorus that subtends a solid angle decreasing with increasing luminosity (as\ninferred from the declining fraction of obscured AGNs), the intrinsic disk\nluminosity, L_D, is approximately proportional to the luminosity of the corona\nin the 2-300 keV energy band, L_C, with the L_D/L_C ratio varying by a factor\nof 2.1 around a mean value of 1.6.

Muon\nenergy has traditionally been determined by measuring the specific energy loss\n(dE/dx) along the muon's path and relating the dE/dx to the muon energy.\nBecause high-energy muons (E_mu > 1 TeV) lose energy randomly, the spread in\ndE/dx values is quite large, leading to a typical energy resolution of 0.29 in\nlog10(E_mu) for a muon observed over a 1 km path length in the IceCube\ndetector.

First, we have an early phase, which is not\ndetected by LAT, and is dominated by lower energies, which arises from the\nphotospheric emissions without any emissions involved in dissipation mechanisms\nand characterized by low Lorentz factor and high radiation efficiency.

As compared with blind, all-sky, all-time GW\nsearches, externally triggered searches for GW counterparts to short GRBs have\nthe advantages of both significantly reduced detection threshold due to known\ntime and sky location and enhanced GW amplitude because of face-on orientation.\nBased on the distribution of signal-to-noise ratios in candidate compact binary\ncoalescence events in the most recent joint LIGO-Virgo data, our analytic\nestimates, and our Monte Carlo simulations, we find an effective sensitive\nvolume for GRB-triggered searches that is about 2 times greater than for an\nall-sky, all-time search.

The cross-power signal between the IRAC\nmaps at 3.6 um and 4.5 um and the Chandra [0.5-2] keV data has been detected,\nat angular scales 20'', with an overall significance of 3.8 sigma and 5.6\nsigma, respectively. At the same time we find no evidence of significant\ncross-correlations at the harder Chandra bands. The cross-correlation signal is\nproduced by individual IR sources with 3.6 um and 4.5 um magnitudes m_AB 25-26\nand [0.5-2] keV X-ray fluxes 7e-17 cgs.We determine that at least 15%-25% of\nthe large scale power of the CIB fluctuations is correlated with the spatial\npower spectrum of the X-ray fluctuations. If this correlation is attributed to\nemission from accretion processes at both IR and X-ray wavelengths, this\nimplies a much higher fraction of accreting black holes than among the known\npopulations. We discuss the various possible origins for the cross-power signal\nand show that neither local foregrounds nor the known remaining normal galaxies\nand active galactic nuclei can reproduce the measurements.

To this end, we perform 3D general-relativistic\nsimulations with a 3-species neutrino leakage scheme. The leakage scheme\ncaptures the essential aspects of neutrino cooling, heating, and lepton number\nexchange as predicted by radiation-hydrodynamics simulations. The 27-solar-mass\nprogenitor was studied in 2D by B. Mueller et al. (ApJ 761:72, 2012), who\nobserved strong growth of the SASI while neutrino-driven convection was\nsuppressed. In our 3D simulations, neutrino-driven convection grows from\nnumerical perturbations imposed by our Cartesian grid. It becomes the dominant\ninstability and leads to large-scale non-oscillatory deformations of the shock\nfront. These will result in strongly aspherical explosions without the need for\nlarge-scale SASI shock oscillations. Low-l-mode SASI oscillations are present\nin our models, but saturate at small amplitudes that decrease with increasing\nneutrino heating and vigor of convection. Our results, in agreement with\nsimpler 3D Newtonian simulations, suggest that once neutrino-driven convection\nis started, it is likely to become the dominant instability in 3D. Whether it\nis the primary instability after bounce will ultimately depend on the physical\nseed perturbations present in the cores of massive stars. The gravitational\nwave signal, which we extract and analyze for the first time from 3D\ngeneral-relativistic models, will serve as an observational probe of the\npostbounce dynamics and, in combination with neutrinos, may allow us to\ndetermine the primary hydrodynamic instability. \n\n"}

We consider as an example the case of a\nmagnetic field loop protruding from the star's surface. The accreting matter is\nassumed to be non magnetized and, due to the high accretion rate, matter\npressure dominates over magnetic pressure. We find that an accretion envelope\ndevelops very rapidly and once it becomes convectively stable the magnetic\nfield is easily buried and pushed into the newly forming neutron star crust.\nHowever, for low enough accretion rates the accretion envelope remains\nconvective for an extended period of time and only partial submergence of the\nmagnetic field occurs due to a residual field that is maintained at the\ninterface between the forming crust and the convective envelope. In this latter\ncase, the outcome should be a weakly magnetized neutron star with a likely\ncomplicated field geometry. In our simulations we find the transition from\ntotal to partial submergence to occur around dotM ~ 10 M_sun/yr.

We set out a\nprocedure for doing QPO searches in the far more numerous, short, less\nenergetic magnetar bursts.

By means of multi-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, we\ninvestigate the acceleration performance of weakly magnetized relativistic\nshocks, in the magnetization range 0<sigma<1e-1. The pre-shock magnetic field\nis orthogonal to the flow, as generically expected for relativistic shocks. We\nfind that relativistic perpendicular shocks propagating in electron-positron\nplasmas are efficient particle accelerators if the magnetization is sigma<1e-3.\nFor electron-ion plasmas, the transition to efficient acceleration occurs for\nsigma<3e-5. Here, the acceleration process proceeds similarly for the two\nspecies, since the electrons enter the shock nearly in equipartition with the\nions, as a result of strong pre-heating in the self-generated upstream\nturbulence. In both electron-positron and electron-ion shocks, we find that the\nmaximum energy of the accelerated particles scales in time as t^(1/2).

Subsequently, Esparza, Kiefer, & Luttenberger obtained\nupper bounds on the convergence rate of Newton's method for certain classes of\nMPSs. More recently, better upper bounds have been obtained for special classes\nof MPSs. However, prior to this paper, for arbitrary (not necessarily\nstrongly-connected) MPSs, no upper bounds at all were known on the convergence\nrate of Newton's method as a function of the encoding size |P| of the input\nMPS, x=P(x).\n  In this paper we provide worst-case upper bounds, as a function of both the\ninput encoding size |P|, and epsilon > 0, on the number of iterations required\nfor decomposed Newton's method (even with rounding) to converge within additive\nerror epsilon > 0 of q^*, for any MPS with LFP solution q^*.

It is well known that the\ndistribution function of relativistic particles is one-dimensional at the\npulsar surface. However, cyclotron instability causes an appearance of\ntransverse momenta of relativistic electrons, which as a result, start to\nradiate in the synchrotron regime. On the basis of the Vlasov's kinetic\nequation we study the process of the quasi-linear diffusion (QLD) developed by\nmeans of the cyclotron instability. This mechanism provides generation of\noptical and X-ray emission on the light cylinder lengthscales. The analysis of\nthe three archival XMM-Newton observations of RX J0420.0-5022 is performed.\nConsidering a different approach of the synchrotron emission theory, the\nspectral energy distribution is obtained that is in a good agreement with the\nobservational data. A fit to the X-ray spectrum is performed using both the\npresent synchrotron emission model spectrum absorbed by cold interstellar\nmatter and generally assumed absorbed black-body model. \n\n"}

Because of the small error, it is no longer\neasy to fit the data with a single dark matter for a fixed diffusion model and\ndark matter profile. In this paper, we propose a new interpretation of the data\nthat it originates from decay of two dark matter. This interpretation gives a\nrough threshold of the lighter DM component. When DM decays into leptons, the\npositron fraction in the cosmic ray depends on the flavor of the final states,\nand this is fixed by imposing non-Abelian discrete symmetry in our model. By\nassuming two gauge-singlet fermionic decaying DM particles, we show that a\nmodel with non-Abelian discrete flavor symmetry, e.g. $T_{13}$, can give a much\nbetter fitting to the AMS-02 data compared with single dark matter scenario.\nFew dimension six operators of universal leptonic decay of DM particles are\nallowed in our model since its decay operators are constrained by the $T_{13}$\nsymmetry. We also show that the lepton masses and mixings are consistent with\ncurrent experimental data, due to the flavor symmetry. \n\n"}

We argue that these observed properties are\ninconsistent with any known class of Galactic transients, and instead suggest a\ncosmological origin. The detection of incoherent radio emission at such\ndistances implies a large emitting region, from which we infer the presence of\nrelativistic ejecta. The observed properties are all consistent with the\npopulation of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), marking the first time\nsuch an outburst has been discovered in the distant universe independent of a\nhigh-energy trigger. We searched for possible high-energy counterparts to\nPTF11agg, but found no evidence for associated prompt emission. We therefore\nconsider three possible scenarios to account for a GRB-like afterglow without a\nhigh-energy counterpart: an \"untriggered\" GRB (lack of satellite coverage), an\n\"orphan\" afterglow (viewing-angle effects), and a \"dirty fireball\" (suppressed\nhigh-energy emission). The observed optical and radio light curves appear\ninconsistent with even the most basic predictions for off-axis afterglow\nmodels. The simplest explanation, then, is that PTF11agg is a normal, on-axis\nlong-duration GRB for which the associated high-energy emission was simply\nmissed. However, we have calculated the likelihood of such a serendipitous\ndiscovery by PTF and find that it is quite small (~ 2.6%). While not\ndefinitive, we nonetheless speculate that PTF11agg may represent a new, more\ncommon (> 4 times the on-axis GRB rate at 90% confidence) class of relativistic\noutbursts lacking associated high-energy emission. \n\n"}

We find\nthat when $T_{\\theta\\phi}$ is included, the rotational speed of the\nhigh-latitude flow decreases, while the density increases and decreases at the\nhigh and low latitudes, respectively. We calculate the radial profiles of\ninflow and outflow rates. We find that the inflow rate decreases inward,\nfollowing a power law form of $\\dot{M}_{\\rm in}\\propto r^s$. The value of $s$\ndepends on the magnitude of $\\alpha$ and is within the range of $\\sim 0.4-1.0$.\nCorrespondingly, the radial profile of density becomes flatter compared with\nthe case of a constant $\\dot{M}(r)$. We find that the density profile can be\ndescribed by $\\rho(r)\\propto r^{-p}$, and the value of $p$ is almost same for a\nwide range of $\\alpha$ ranging from $\\alpha=0.1$ to $0.005$. The inward\ndecrease of inflow accretion rate is very similar to hot accretion flows, which\nis attributed to the mass loss in outflows. To study the origin of outflow, we\nanalyze the convective stability of slim disk. We find that depending on the\nvalue of $\\alpha$, the flow is marginally stable (when $\\alpha$ is small) or\nunstable (when $\\alpha$ is large). This is different from the case of\nhydrodynamical hot accretion flow where radiation is dynamically unimportant\nand the flow is always convectively unstable. We speculate that the reason for\nthe difference is because radiation can stabilize convection. The origin of\noutflow is thus likely because of the joint function of convection and\nradiation, but further investigation is required. \n\n"}

The width\nof the broad Balmer line is a direct indicator of the downstream plasma\ntemperature. In case of efficient particle acceleration an appreciable fraction\nof the total kinetic energy of the plasma is channeled into CRs, therefore the\ndownstream temperature decreases and so does the broad Balmer line width. This\nwidth also depends on the level of thermal equilibration between ions and\nneutral hydrogen atoms in the downstream. Since in general in young SNR shocks\nonly a few charge exchange (CE) reactions occur before ionization,\nequilibration between ions and neutrals is not reached, and a kinetic\ndescription of the neutrals is required in order to properly compute Balmer\nemission.\n  We provide a method for the calculation of Balmer emission using a\nself-consistent description of the shock structure in the presence of neutrals\nand CRs. We use a recently developed semi-analytical approach, where neutral\nparticles, ionized plasma, accelerated particles and magnetic fields are all\ncoupled together through the mass, momentum and energy flux conservation\nequations. The distribution of neutrals is obtained from the full Boltzmann\nequation in velocity space, coupled to Maxwellian ions through ionization and\nCE processes.

This would remove energy from the tidal bulge, resulting in\ndissipation and possibly affecting the phase evolution of inspiralling binary\nneutron stars and hence the extraction of binary parameters from gravitational\nwave observations. This instability appears to arise because of a large\nthree-mode interaction among the tidal mode and high-order p- and g-modes of\nsimilar radial wavenumber. We show that additional four-mode interactions enter\ninto the analysis at the same order as the three-mode terms previously\nconsidered. We compute these four-mode couplings by finding a volume-preserving\ncoordinate transformation that relates the energy of a tidally deformed star to\nthat of a radially perturbed spherical star. Using this method, we relate the\nfour-mode coupling to three-mode couplings and show that there is a near-exact\ncancellation between the destabilizing effect of the three-mode interactions\nand the stabilizing effect of the four-mode interaction. We then show that the\nequilibrium tide is stable against the quasi-static decay into daughter p- and\ng-modes to leading order. The leading deviation from the quasi-static\napproximation due to orbital motion of the binary is considered; while it may\nslightly spoil the near-cancellation, any resulting instability timescale is at\nleast of order the gravitational-wave inspiral time. We conclude that the\np-/g-mode coupling does not lead to a quasi-static instability, and does not\nimpact the phase evolution of gravitational waves from binary neutron stars. \n\n"}

For sophisticated algorithms such as Heller et al's lazy set, it\neven is possible for an operation to be linearised by the concurrent execution\nof a statement outside the operation being verified. This paper proposes an\nalternative method for verifying linearisability that does not require\nidentification of linearisation points. Instead, using an interval-based logic,\nwe show that every behaviour of each concrete operation over any interval is a\npossible behaviour of a corresponding abstraction that executes with\ncoarse-grained atomicity. This approach is applied to Heller et al's lazy set\nto show that verification of linearisability is possible without having to\nconsider linearisation points within the program code. \n\n"}

We\nderive the general relativistic expression for the disc vortensity (vorticity\ndivided by surface density), which governs the behaviour of density\nperturbation near corotation. Depending on the gradient of the generalized disc\nvortensity, corotational wave absorption can lead to the amplification or\ndamping of the spiral wave.

The accretion disk luminosity and jet power, on the other hand, have\nlong been observed to follow a linear correlation. If jet power is coupled to\nblack hole spin, deviations from the jet-disk correlation for a sample of AGN\ncan be used to probe the dispersion of the spin parameter within this sample.\nTo exploit this idea, we matched double-lobed radio sources from the FIRST\nsurvey to spectroscopically confirmed quasars from SDSS. We obtain 763 FR-II\nquasars with a median redshift of z=1.2 A tight correlation between the optical\nluminosity of the accretion disk and the lobe radio luminosity is observed. We\nestimate that 5-20% of the bolometric disk luminosity is converted to jet\npower.

Under the assumption that the\nBlandford-Znajek mechanism operates in AGN, we obtain an upper limit of 0.1 dex\nto the dispersion of the product of the spin and the magnetic flux threading\nthe horizon.

Their properties\nsuggest extreme environments and interesting physics, but in order to\nunderstand and study these events, more examples need to be found.

This result is achieved through a new method for\nmeasuring the product of the jet Lorentz factor and the intrinsic opening angle\nGamma*theta_j from measured apparent opening angles in flux density limited\nsamples of AGN jets. The Gamma*theta_j parameter is important for jet physics\nbecause it is related to the jet-frame sidewise expansion speed and causal\nconnection between the jet edges and its symmetry axis. Most importantly, the\nstandard model of jet production requires that the jet be causally connected\nwith its symmetry axis, implying that Gamma*theta_j < 1. When we apply our\nmethod to the MOJAVE flux density limited sample of radio loud objects, we find\nGamma*theta_j = 0.2, implying that AGN jets are causally connected. We also\nfind evidence that AGN jets viewed very close to the line of sight effectively\nhave smaller intrinsic opening angles compared with jets viewed more off-axis,\nwhich is consistent with Doppler beaming and a fast inner spine/slow outer\nsheath velocity field. Notably, gamma-ray burst (GRB) jets have a typical\nGamma*theta_j that is two orders of magnitude higher, suggesting that different\nphysical mechanisms are at work in GRB jets compared to AGN jets. A useful\napplication of our result is that a jet's beaming parameters can be derived.\nAssuming Gamma*theta_j is approximately constant in the AGN jet population, an\nindividual jet's Doppler factor and Lorentz factor (and therefore also its\nviewing angle) can be determined using two observable quantities: apparent jet\nopening angle and the apparent speed of jet components. \n\n"}

It has\nbeen suggested that the presence of large numbers of millisecond pulsars (MSPs)\nwithin these clusters may be either directly responsible for these gamma-ray\nfluxes through emission of pulsed curvature radiation, or indirectly through\nthe injection of relativistic leptons into the cluster. These relativistic\nparticles are plausibly re-accelerated in shocks, created by the collision of\nstellar winds, before interacting with the soft-photon radiation field set up\nby the stellar population of the host cluster.

For the sake of our systematic study, we employ a light-bulb scheme\nto trigger explosions and a three-flavor neutrino leakage scheme to treat\ndeleptonization effects and neutrino losses from proto-neutron star interior.\nUsing a 15 solar mass progenitor, we compute thirty models in 3D with a wide\nvariety of initial angular momentum and light-bulb neutrino luminosity. We find\nthat the rotation can help onset of neutrino-driven explosions for the models\nin which the initial angular momentum is matched to that obtained in recent\nstellar evolutionary calculations (0.3-3 rad/s at the center). For the models\nwith larger initial angular momentum, the shock surface deforms to be more\noblate due to larger centrifugal force.

The questions one has to answer are whether the EOS universality\nis preserved in this regime and what are the deviations from general\nrelativity. Our results show that the $\\bar{I}-\\bar{Q}$ relation is nearly EOS\nindependent for scalarized rapidly rotating stars, but the differences with\npure Einstein's theory increase compared to the slowly rotating case. In\ngeneral, smaller negative values of the scalar field coupling parameters\n$\\beta$ lead to larger deviations, but these deviations are below the expected\naccuracy of the future astrophysical observations if one considers values of\n$\\beta$ in agreement with the current observational constraint. An important\nremark is that although the normalized $\\bar{I}-\\bar{Q}$ relation is quite\nsimilar for scalar-tensor theories and general relativity, the unnormalized\nmoment of inertia and quadrupole moment can be very different in the two\ntheories.

Sample, data\n  analysis, and correlation to star-forming regions Abstract: [Abridged] We use optical IFS of nearby SN host galaxies provided by the\nCALIFA Survey with the goal of finding correlations in the environmental\nparameters at the location of different SN types. We recover the sequence in\nassociation of different SN types to the star-forming regions by using several\nindicators of the ongoing and recent SF related to both the ionized gas and the\nstellar populations. While the total ongoing SF is on average the same for the\nthree SN types, SNe Ibc/IIb tend to happen closer to star-forming regions and\noccur in higher SF density locations compared to SNe II and SNe~Ia, the latter\nshowing the weakest correlation. SNe~Ia host galaxies have on average masses\nthat are $\\sim$0.3-0.8~dex higher than CC SNe hosts due to a larger fraction of\nold stellar populations in the SNe~Ia hosts. Using the recent SN~Ia delay-time\ndistribution and the SFHs of the galaxies, we show that the SN~Ia hosts in our\nsample should presently produce a factor 2 more SNe~Ia than the CC~SN hosts.\nSince both types are in hosts with similar SF rate and hence similar CC~SN\nrate, this can explain the mass difference between the SN~Ia and CC~SN hosts,\nand reinforce the finding that at least part of SNe~Ia should originate from\nvery old progenitors. Comparing the mean SFH of the eight least massive\ngalaxies to that of the massive SF SN~Ia hosts we find that the low-mass\ngalaxies formed their stars over more extended time than the massive SN~Ia\nhosts. We estimate that the low-mass galaxies should produce by a factor of 10\nless SNe~Ia, and a factor of 3 less CC~SNe than the high-mass group. Therefore\nthe ratio between the number of CC~SNe and SNe~Ia is expected to increase with\ndecreasing the galaxy mass.

Taking advantage of the\nsuperb angular resolution of HST, we characterize the galaxies' morphological\nproperties, sizes and star formation rate (SFR) densities. We determine the\nsupernova (SN) locations within the host galaxies through precise astrometric\nmatching, and measure physical and host-normalized offsets, as well as the SN\npositions within the cumulative distribution of UV light pixel brightness. We\nfind that the host galaxies of H-poor SLSNe are irregular, compact dwarf\ngalaxies, with a median half-light radius of just 0.9 kpc. The UV-derived SFR\ndensities are high (<Sigma_SFR> ~ 0.1 M_sun/yr/kpc^2), suggesting that SLSNe\nform in overdense environments.

However, GW sky locations that are uncertain by\nhundreds of square degrees will pose a challenge.

Next, in\npreparation for the optical search with the intermediate Palomar Transient\nFactory (iPTF), we have developed a unique capability to detect optical\nafterglows of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) detected by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst\nMonitor (GBM). Its comparable error regions offer a close parallel to the\nAdvanced LIGO problem, but Fermi's unique access to MeV-GeV photons and its\nnear all-sky coverage may allow us to look at optical afterglows in a\nrelatively unexplored part of the GRB parameter space.

The study includes an\nanalytical treatment of the evolution of the envelop lost by the star within\nthe jet, and calculations of the related high-energy radiation.\n  The model readily explains the day-long, variable on timescales of hours, GeV\ngamma-ray flare from \\c454, observed during November 2010 on top of a\nweeks-long plateau. In the proposed scenario, the plateau state is caused by a\nstrong wind generated by the heating of the star atmosphere by nonthermal\nparticles accelerated at the jet-star interaction region. The flare itself\ncould be produced by a few clouds of matter lost by the red giant after the\ninitial impact of the jet.

In this contribution I review the evidence collected during the last\nyears showing that the ridge-lines of helical radio-jets do not correspond to\nobservational artifacts.

Observations\nsince 2009 have been made with new wider-bandwidth spectrometers than were\npreviously employed in this survey. A new data reduction pipeline has been in\nplace since mid-2011 which consists of standard methods using dedispersion,\nsearches for accelerated periodic sources, and search for single pulses, as\nwell as new interference-excision strategies and candidate selection\nheuristics. This pipeline has been used to discover 41 pulsars, including 8\nmillisecond pulsars (MSPs; P < 10 ms), bringing the PALFA survey's discovery\ntotals to 145 pulsars, including 17 MSPs, and one Fast Radio Burst (FRB). The\npipeline presented here has also re-detected 188 previously known pulsars\nincluding 60 found in PALFA data by re-analyzing observations previously\nsearched by other pipelines. A comprehensive description of the survey\nsensitivity, including the effect of interference and red noise, has been\ndetermined using synthetic pulsar signals with various parameters and\namplitudes injected into real survey observations and subsequently recovered\nwith the data reduction pipeline. We have confirmed that the PALFA survey\nachieves the sensitivity to MSPs predicted by theoretical models. However, we\nalso find that compared to theoretical survey sensitivity models commonly used\nthere is a degradation in sensitivity to pulsars with periods P >= 100 ms that\ngradually becomes up to a factor of ~10 worse for P > 4 s at DM < 150 pc/cc.\nThis degradation of sensitivity at long periods is largely due to red noise.

In Tauris et al. (2013), it was demonstrated that\nhelium star companions to neutron stars (NSs) may experience mass transfer and\nevolve into naked ~1.5 M_sun metal cores, barely above the Chandrasekhar mass\nlimit. Here we present a systematic investigation of the progenitor evolution\nleading to ultra-stripped supernovae (SNe). In particular, we examine the\nbinary parameter space leading to electron-capture (EC SNe) and iron\ncore-collapse SNe (Fe CCSNe), respectively, and determine the amount of helium\nejected with applications to their observational classification as Type Ib or\nType Ic. We mainly evolve systems where the SN progenitors are helium star\ndonors of initial mass M_He = 2.5 - 3.5 M_sun in tight binaries with orbital\nperiods of P_orb = 0.06 - 2.0 days, and hosting an accreting NS, but we also\ndiscuss the evolution of wider systems and of both more massive and lighter -\nas well as single - helium stars. In some cases we are able to follow the\nevolution until the onset of silicon burning, just a few days prior to the SN\nexplosion.

The difference between the ~410 Hz QPO\nfrequency and the spin frequency follows a similar frequency correlation as the\nlow frequency power spectral components, suggesting that the ~410 Hz QPO is a\nretrograde beat against the spin frequency of a rotational phenomenon in the 9\nHz range.

On the arithmetical side, analysing\ncertain recursions, combining an application-specific recursion with a\nrecursion from the field of meta-Fibonacci sequences (indeed S_2 equals twice\nthe Conolly sequence).\n  A further tool is the consideration of unsatisfiable \"hitting clause-sets\"\n(UHITs), special cases of MUs, which correspond to the partitions of the\nboolean hypercube by subcubes; they are also known as orthogonal or disjoint\nDNF tautologies.

A signal can\nfurther be classified as Gaussian-stochastic if a Gaussian signal model is\nfavored. In our analysis we use Bayesian model selection to choose between\nseveral signal and noise models for simulated data consisting of uncorrelated\nGaussian detector noise plus a superposition of sinusoidal signals from an\nastrophysical population of gravitational-wave sources.

In weakly magnetized or quasi parallel-shocks (where the magnetic\nfield is nearly aligned with the flow), particle acceleration is efficient. The\naccelerated particles stream ahead of the shock, where they generate strong\nmagnetic waves which in turn scatter the particles back and forth across the\nshock, mediating their acceleration.

When we applied the same technique to this\npulsar dataset with two different values for the trial luminosity function in\nthe zeroth iteration, we find that neither of them can reproduce a value of\n$10^5$ for the ratio of the convergence error between these distance exponents.\nWe then reconstruct the differential pulsar luminosity function using\nLynden-Bell's $C^{-}$ method after positing both an inverse-linear and an\ninverse-square scalings with distance.

The I-Love-Q relations (between\nthe moment of inertia, the tidal deformability and the quadrupole moment) are\nhowever approximately insensitive to this structure. These relations become\nexact for stationary black holes in General Relativity as shown by the no-hair\ntheorems. In this paper, we take the first steps toward studying how the\napproximate I-Love-Q relations become exact in the limit as compact stars\nbecome black holes. To do so, we consider a toy model, i.e. incompressible\nstars with anisotropic pressure, which allows us to model an equilibrium\nsequence of stars with their compactness approaching the black hole limit\narbitrarily closely. We extract the I-Love-Q trio by numerically constructing\nsuch a sequence in the slow-rotation and small-tide approximations. We find\nthat the I-Love-Q relations approach the black hole limit in a nontrivial way,\nwith the quadrupole moment and the tidal deformability changing sign as the\ncompactness and the amount of anisotropy are increased. Generalizing Maclaurin\nspheroids to anisotropic stars, we show that the multipole moments also change\nsign in the Newtonian limit as the amount of anisotropy is increased. We also\nprove analytically that the stellar moment of inertia reaches the black hole\nlimit as the compactness reaches the black hole value in the strongly\nanisotropic limit. Modeling the black hole limit through a sequence of\nanisotropic stars, however, fails when considering other theories of gravity.\nWe calculate the scalar dipole charge and the moment of inertia in a\nparity-violating modified theory and find that these quantities do not tend to\ntheir black hole counterparts as the anisotropic stellar sequence approaches\nthe black hole limit. \n\n"}

Using two-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, we\ninvestigate particle and radiation beaming, finding a very different picture.\nInstead of having a relativistic average bulk motion with isotropic electron\nvelocity distribution in its rest frame, we find that the bulk motion of\nparticles in X-points is similar to their Lorentz factor gamma, and the\nparticles are beamed within about 5/gamma. On the way from the X-point to the\nmagnetic islands, particles turn in the magnetic field, forming a fan confined\nto the current sheet. Once they reach the islands they isotropise after\ncompleting a full Larmor gyration and their radiation is not strongly beamed\nanymore. The radiation pattern at a given frequency depends on where the\ncorresponding emitting electrons radiate their energy. Lower energy particles\nthat cool slowly spend most of their time in the islands, and their radiation\nis not highly beamed. Only particles that quickly cool at the edge of the\nX-points generate a highly beamed fan-like radiation pattern.

Equivalence relations can be used to reduce\nthe size of a parity game, thereby potentially alleviating part of the\ncomputational burden.

Abstract: Supernova remnants (SNRs) have commonly been considered as a source of the\nobserved PeV cosmic rays (CRs) or a Galactic PeV particle accelerator\n(\"Pevatron\"). In this work, we study Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), which is the\nlow-luminosity active galactic nucleus of the Milky Way Galaxy, as another\npossible canditate of the Pevatron, because it sometimes became very active in\nthe past. We assume that a large number of PeV CRs were injected by Sgr A* at\nthe outburst about 10^7 yr ago when the Fermi bubbles were created. We\nconstrain the diffusion coefficient for the CRs in the Galactic halo on the\ncondition that the CRs have arrived on the Earth by now, while a fairly large\nfraction of them have escaped from the halo. Based on a diffusion-halo model,\nwe solve a diffusion equation for the CRs and compare the results with the CR\nspectrum on the Earth. The observed small anisotropy of the arrival directions\nof CRs may be explained if the diffusion coefficient in the Galactic disk is\nsmaller than that in the halo. Our model predicts that a boron-to-carbon ratio\nshould be energy-independent around the knee, where the CRs from Sgr A* become\ndominant.

Beyond r~30 kpc the intra-cluster\nmedium (ICM) appears remarkably isothermal. The core is dynamically disturbed\nwith multiple sloshing induced cold fronts, with indications for both\nRayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. The sloshing is the result\nof the strongly perturbed gravitational potential in the cluster core, with the\ncentral brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) being displaced southward from the\nglobal center of mass. The residual image reveals a likely subcluster south of\nthe core at the projected distance of r~280 kpc. The cluster also harbors a\nlikely radio phoenix, a source revived by adiabatic compression by gas motions\nin the ICM. Even though the Ophiuchus cluster is strongly dynamically active,\nthe amplitude of density fluctuations outside of the cooling core is low,\nindicating velocities smaller than ~100 km/s. The density fluctuations might be\ndamped by thermal conduction in the hot and remarkably isothermal ICM,\nresulting in our underestimate of gas velocities. We find a surprising, sharp\nsurface brightness discontinuity, that is curved away from the core, at r~120\nkpc to the southeast of the cluster center.

The cooling core lacks\nany observable X-ray cavities and the AGN only displays weak, point-like radio\nemission, lacking lobes or jets, indicating that currently it may be largely\ndormant.

We\ndemonstrate the accuracy of our formalism for CR acceleration at shocks through\nsimulations of plane-parallel shock tubes that are compared to newly derived\nexact solutions of the Riemann shock tube problem with CR acceleration. We find\nthat the increased compressibility of the post-shock plasma due to the produced\nCRs decreases the shock speed.

The two main competing\nmechanisms are the extensively studied internal shocks and the less studied\nmagnetic reconnection. Here we consider GRB emission from magnetic reconnection\naccounting for the relativistic bulk motions that it produces in the jet's bulk\nrest frame. Far from the source the magnetic field is almost exactly normal to\nthe radial direction, suggesting locally quasi-spherical thin reconnection\nlayers between regions of oppositely directed magnetic field. We show that if\nthe relativistic motions in the jet's frame are confined to such a\nquasi-spherical uniform layer, then the resulting GRB lightcurves are\nindependent of their direction distribution within this layer. This renders\nprevious results for a delta-function velocity-direction distribution\n(Beniamini & Granot 2016) applicable to a much more general class of\nreconnection models, which are suggested by numerical simulations. Such models\nthat vary in their velocity-direction distribution differ mainly in the size of\nthe bright region that contributes most of the observed flux at a given\nemission radius or observed time. The more sharply peaked this distribution,\nthe smaller this bright region, and the stronger the lightcurve variability\nthat may be induced by deviations from a uniform emission over the thin\nreconnection layer, which may be expected in a realistic GRB outflow. This is\nreflected both in the observed image at a given observed time and in the\nobserver-frame emissivity map at a given emission radius, which are calculated\nhere for three simple velocity-direction distributions. \n\n"}

The two spectra are found to\nprogressively harden at rigidity $R = pc/Z >\\,$200 GV, while the p/He ratio is\nfound to fall off steadily as $p/He\\sim\\,R^{-0.08}$. The p/He decrease is often\ninterpreted in terms of particle-dependent acceleration, which is in contrast\nwith the universal nature of DSA mechanisms. A different explanation is that\nthe p-He anomaly reflects a flux transition between two components: a sub-TeV\nflux component (L) provided by hydrogen-rich supernova remnants with soft\nacceleration spectra, and a multi-TeV component (G) injected by younger sources\nwith amplified magnetic fields and hard spectra. In this scenario the\nuniversality of particle acceleration is not violated because both sources\nprovide composition-blind injection spectra. The present work is aimed at\ntesting this model using the low-energy CR flux which is expected to be\nL-dominated. However, at $E\\sim\\,$0.5-10 GeV, the fluxes are affected by energy\nlosses and solar modulation for which a proper modeling is required.

It confirms that pure secondary predictions fall\nbelow the data above 10 GeV, suggesting the presence of a primary component,\ne.g. annihilations of WIMPs dark matter. Most analyses have focused on the\nhigh-energy part of the spectrum, disregarding the GeV energy region where\ncosmic ray transport is harder to model and solar modulation comes into play.\nGiven the high quality of AMS measurements, it is timely to re-examine the\npositron anomaly over the entire energy range, taking into account transport\nprocesses so far neglected, e.g. convection or diffusive re-acceleration. We\ndevise a new semi-analytical method to take into account transport processes so\nfar neglected, but important below a few GeV. It is based on the pinching of\ninverse Compton and synchrotron energy losses inside the Galactic disc. It\nallows to carry out extensive scans over the cosmic ray propagation parameters,\nwhich we strongly constrain by requiring that the secondary component does not\novershoot the AMS measurements. Only models with large diffusion coefficients\nsurvive this test. The positron flux is a powerful and independent probe of\ncosmic ray propagation, complementary to the boron-to-carbon ratio. We then\nscan over WIMP mass to fit the annihilation cross section and branching ratios,\nexploring both direct annihilations into standard model particles or through\nlight mediators. In the former case, the best fit yields a $p$-value of 0.4%\nfor a mass of 264 GeV, a value that does not allow to reproduce the highest\nenergy data points. Worse quality fits are found in the latter case. The\ninterpretation of the positron excess in terms of single DM species\nannihilations is strongly disfavored. This conclusion is based solely on the\npositron data, and no other observation needs to be invoked. \n\n"}

These simplifications usually rely on\nso-called redundancy properties that characterize cases in which the removal of\na clause does not affect the satisfiability status of a formula. One\nparticularly successful redundancy property is that of blocked clauses, because\nit generalizes several other redundancy properties. To find out whether a\nclause is blocked---and therefore redundant---one only needs to consider its\nresolution environment, i.e., the clauses with which it can be resolved.

We constructed general\nrelativistic magnetohydrodynamics models for these sources that qualitatively\nwell describe their spectra and radio/mm images invoking a coupled jet-disk\nsystem. Using general relativistic polarized radiative transfer, we now also\nmodel the observed mm rotation measure (RM) of M87.

For the inferred low viewing\nangles of the M87 jet, the RM is low even as the black hole $\\mdot$ increases\nby a factor of $\\simeq100$. In jet-dominated models, the observed linear\npolarization is produced in the forward-jet, while the dense accretion disk\ndepolarizes the bulk of the near-horizon scale emission which originates in the\ncounter-jet.

More\nrecently, the possible co-existence of a first family composed of \"normal\"\nneutron stars with a second family of strange quark stars has been proposed as\na solution of problems related to the maximum mass and to the minimal radius of\nthese compact stellar objects. In this paper we study the mass distribution of\ncompact objects formed in binary systems and the relative fractions of quark\nand neutron stars in different subpopulations. We incorporate the strange quark\nstar formation model provided by the two-families scenario and we perform a\nlarge-scale population synthesis study in order to obtain the population\ncharacteristics. In our model, below a critical gravitational mass\n$M_\\mathrm{max}^H- \\Delta M$ only normal (hadron) neutron stars exist. Then in\nthe mass range $(M_\\mathrm{max}^H- \\Delta M) \\leqslant M \\leqslant\nM_\\mathrm{max}^H$ strange quark stars and neutron stars coexist. Finally, above\n$M_\\mathrm{max}^H$ all compact objects are strange quark stars. We argue that\n$M_\\mathrm{max}^H$ is in the range $\\sim 1.5-1.6 M_\\odot$. According to our\nresults, the main channel for strange quark star formation in binary systems is\naccretion from a secondary companion on a neutron star.This opens the\npossibility of having explosive GRB-like phenomena not related to supernovae\nand not due to the merger of two neutron stars. The enhancement in the number\nof compact objects in the co-existence mass range $(M_\\mathrm{max}^H- \\Delta M)\n\\leqslant M \\leqslant M_\\mathrm{max}^H$ is not very pronounced. The number of\ndouble strange quark star's systems is rather small with only a tiny fraction\nwhich merge within a Hubble time.

When the gas angular momentum is low enough to form a\nrotationally supported disk within the Bondi radius ($R_{\\rm B}$), we find a\nglobal steady accretion solution. The solution consists of a rotational\nequilibrium distribution at $r\\sim R_{\\rm B}$, where the density follows $\\rho\n\\propto (1+R_{\\rm B}/r)^{3/2}$, surrounding a geometrically thick and optically\nthin accretion disk at the centrifugal radius, where thermal energy generated\nby viscosity is transported via strong convection. Physical properties of the\ninner solution agree with those expected in convection-dominated accretion\nflows (CDAF; $\\rho \\propto r^{-1/2}$). In the inner CDAF solution, the gas\ninflow rate decreases towards the center due to convection ($\\dot{M}\\propto\nr$), and the net accretion rate (including both inflows and outflows) is\nstrongly suppressed by several orders of magnitude from the Bondi accretion\nrate $\\dot{M}_{\\rm B}$ The net accretion rate depends on the viscous strength,\nfollowing $\\dot{M}/\\dot{M}_{\\rm B}\\propto (\\alpha/0.01)^{0.6}$.

Besides introducing ad-hoc\nsmoothing, this has a significant negative impact on either computational cost\nor complexity and parallel scalings. We describe a new numerical algorithm for\nCR transport, with close parallels to two moment methods for radiative transfer\nunder the reduced speed of light approximation. It stably and robustly handles\nCR streaming without any artificial diffusion. It allows for both isotropic and\nfield-aligned CR streaming and diffusion, with arbitrary streaming and\ndiffusion coefficients. CR transport is handled explicitly, while source terms\nare handled implicitly. The overall time-step scales linearly with resolution\n(even when computing CR diffusion), and has a perfect parallel scaling.

The efficiency of thermal conduction in\nthe intracluster medium (ICM) is complicated by the existence of turbulence and\nmagnetic fields, and has received a lot of attention in the literature.\nPrevious studies suggest that the magnetothermal instability developed in outer\nregions of galaxy clusters would drive magnetic field lines preferentially\nradial, resulting in efficient conduction along the radial direction. Using a\nseries of spherically-symmetric simulations, here we investigate the impact of\nthermal conduction on the observed temperature distributions in outer regions\nof three massive clusters, and find that thermal conduction substantially\nmodifies the ICM temperature profile. Within 3 Gyr, the gas temperature at a\nrepresentative radius of $0.3r_{500}$ typically decreases by ~10 - 20% and the\naverage temperature slope between $0.3r_{500}$ and $r_{500}$ drops by ~ 30 -\n40%, indicating that the observed ICM would not stay in a long-term equilibrium\nstate in the presence of thermal conduction. However, X-ray observations show\nthat the outer regions of massive clusters have remarkably similar\nradially-declining temperature profiles, suggesting that they should be quite\nstable. Our study thus suggests that the effective conductivity along the\nradial direction must be suppressed below the Spitzer value by a factor of 10\nor more, unless additional heating sources offset conductive cooling and\nmaintain the observed temperature distributions.

The tidal disruption of stellar binaries by a massive BH is\nknown to produce hypervelocity stars. However, such a tidal encounter does not\nalways lead to the break-up of binaries. Since surviving binaries tend to\nbecome hard and eccentric, this process can produce BH mergers in principle.\nFor initially circular binaries, we show that the gravitational wave (GW)\nmerger times become shorter by a factor of more than $10^{2}$ ($10^5$) in\n$10\\%$ ($1\\%$) of the surviving cases. This reduction is primarily due to the\ngrowth in binary's eccentricity at the tidal encounter. We also investigate the\neffective spins of the survivors, assuming that BH spins are initially aligned\nwith the binary orbital angular momentum. We find that binary orientations can\nflip in the opposite direction at the tidal encounter. For the survivors with\nlarge merger time reduction factors, the effective spin distribution is rather\nflat. We estimate the merger rate due to the tidal encounter channel to be\n$\\sim 0.6\\ \\textrm{Gpc}^{-3}\\textrm{yr}^{-1}$. This mechanism is unlikely to be\nthe dominant formation channel of BH mergers. However, the current and\nnear-future GW observatories are expected to detect an enormous number of BH\nmergers. If mergers are found in the vicinity of massive BHs (e.g. the\ndetection of GW lensing echoes or preceding extreme-mass-ratio bursts), this\nmechanism would provide a possible explanation for their origin. \n\n"}

NGC 253 is one of only two starburst galaxies found to\nemit $\\gamma$-rays from hundreds of MeV to multi-TeV energies. Accurate\nmeasurements of the very-high-energy (VHE) (E $>$ 100 GeV) and high-energy (HE)\n(E $>$ 60 MeV) spectra are crucial to study the underlying particle\naccelerators and cosmic-ray interaction and transport.\n  Aims. The measurement of the VHE $\\gamma$-ray emission of NGC 253 published\nin 2012 by H.E.S.S. was limited by large systematic uncertainties. Here, a\nmeasurement of the $\\gamma$-ray spectrum of NGC 253 is investigated in both HE\nand VHE $\\gamma$-rays.\n  Methods. The data of H.E.S.S. observations are reanalysed using an updated\ncalibration and analysis chain. The $Fermi$-LAT analysis employs more than 8\nyears of data processed using pass 8. The cosmic-ray particle population is\nevaluated from the combined HE--VHE $\\gamma$-ray spectrum using NAIMA.\n  Results.

Tests with mock data\nshow that reconstructing the map of a certain frequency from other frequency\nregimes works astonishingly well, predicting reliably small-scale details well\nbelow the spatial resolution of the initially learned map.

The population of these\nsystems will create an ensemble gravitational-wave signal at nanohertz\nfrequencies that is detectable by Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTA), such as the North\nAmerican Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav).

Theoretical models and general relativistic\nmagnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations indicate that the key jet-making\ningredient is large-scale poloidal magnetic flux.

Yet, some ULX\nhave been shown to display periodic modulations and coherent pulsations,\nsuggestive of a neutron star in orbit around a stellar companion and accreting\nat super-Eddington rates. In this letter, we propose that the mass transfer in\nULX could be qualitatively the same as in Supergiant X-ray binaries (SgXB),\nwith a wind from the donor star highly beamed towards the compact object. Since\nthe star does not fill its Roche lobe, this mass transfer mechanism known as\n\"wind Roche lobe overflow\" can remain stable even for large mass ratios. Based\non realistic acceleration profiles derived from spectral observations and\nmodeling of the stellar wind, we compute the bulk motion of the wind to\nevaluate the fraction of the stellar mass outflow captured by the compact\nobject. We identify the orbital and stellar conditions for a SgXB to transfer\nmass at rates matching the expectations for ULX and show that the transition\nfrom SgXB to ULX luminosity levels is progressive. These results indicate that\na high stellar Roche lobe filling factor is not necessary to funnel large\nquantities of material into the Roche lobe of the accretor.

We utilised the LOFAR Two-Metre\nSky Survey DR1, using a visual identification method to compile a sample of\nmorphologically selected candidate DDRGs, showing two pairs of radio lobes. To\nconfirm the restarted nature in each of the candidate sources, we obtained\nfollow-up observations with the VLA at higher resolution to observe the inner\nlobes or restarted jets, the confirmation of which created a robust sample of\n33 DDRGs. We created a comparison sample of 777 RLAGN from the DR1 catalogue,\nand compared the optical and infrared magnitudes and colours of their host\ngalaxies.

Abstract: The origin of the X-ray afterglows of gamma-ray bursts has regularly been\ndebated.

We show that the data for GRB140903A favours the millisecond-magnetar\nmodel for all possible equations of state, while the data for GRB130603B\nfavours the millisecond-magnetar model if $M_{\\textrm{TOV}} \\gtrsim 2.3\nM_{\\odot}$.

In this work corrected\nneutrino spallation cross sections for 4He and 12C are adopted. Initial\nabundances involving heavy s-nuclei and other physical conditions are derived\nin a new calculation of the SN 1987A progenitor in which effects of the\nprogenitor metallicity are included. A dependence of the SN nucleosynthesis and\nfinal yields of 7Li and 11B on the neutrino mass hierarchy are shown in several\nstellar locations. In the normal hierarchy case, the charged current reaction\nrates of electron neutrinos are enhanced, and yields of proton-rich nuclei,\nalong with 7Be and 11C, are increased. In the inverted hierarchy case, the\ncharged current reaction rates of electron antineutrinos are enhanced, and\nyields of neutron-rich nuclei, along with 7Li and 11B, are increased. We find\nthat variation of the metallicity modifies the yields of 7Li, 7Be, 11B, and\n11C. This effect is caused by changes in the neutron abundance during SN\nnucleosynthesis.

The latter has a break at a peak\nflux of 1.5 ph/cm^2/s, while the distribution of simple bursts is smooth down\nto the BATSE threshold. We also observe brightness dependent variations in the\nshape of the average peak aligned time profile (ATP) of GRBs. The decaying\nslope of the ATP shows time dilation when comparing bright and dim bursts while\nthe rising slope hardly changes.
