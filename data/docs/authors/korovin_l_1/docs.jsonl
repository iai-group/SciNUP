For\nthe relevant case of a single-channel probe, we find that the resulting\npotentials are exactly independent of the transparency of the contact between\nthe probe and the system. Assuming that spin relaxation processes are absent in\nthe probe, we therefore identify the local spin-dependent potentials in the\nsample at the probe position, and hence the local current-induced spin\npolarization, with the spin-dependent potentials in the probe itself. The\nstatistics of these local chemical potentials is calculated within random\nmatrix theory.

Here we\ninvestigate the transition between QSH and normal insulating phases under\ntopological deformations of a two-dimensional lattice. We demonstrate that the\nQSH phase present in the honeycomb lattice looses its robustness as the\noccupancy of extra lattice sites is allowed. Furthermore, we propose a method\nfor verifying our predictions with fermionic cold atoms in optical lattices. In\nthis context, the spin-orbit interaction is engineered via an appropriate\nsynthetic gauge field. \n\n"}

Dynamical decoupling (DD) is\none of the most effective experimental methods for maintaining coherence,\nespecially when one can access only the qubit-system and not its environment\n(bath). It involves the application of pulses to the system whose net effect is\na reversal of the system-environment interaction. In any real system, however,\nthe environment is not static, and therefore the reversal of the\nsystem-environment interaction becomes imperfect if the spacing between\nrefocusing pulses becomes comparable to or longer than the correlation time of\nthe environment. The efficiency of the refocusing improves therefore if the\nspacing between the pulses is reduced. Here, we quantify the efficiency of\ndifferent DD sequences in preserving different quantum states. We use 13C\nnuclear spins as qubits and an environment of 1H nuclear spins as the\nenvironment, which couples to the qubit via magnetic dipole-dipole couplings.\nStrong dipole-dipole couplings between the proton spins result in a rapidly\nfluctuating environment with a correlation time of the order of 100 us. Our\nexperimental results show that short delays between the pulses yield better\nperformance if they are compared with the bath correlation time. However, as\nthe pulse spacing becomes shorter than the bath correlation time, an optimum is\nreached. For even shorter delays, the pulse imperfections dominate over the\ndecoherence losses and cause the quantum state to decay. \n\n"}

Under special circumstances, a\nsubspace of the system's Hilbert space remains coherent, or \"decoherence free\",\nand the reduced density matrix approaches a non-trivial limit which contains\ninformation on its initial quantum state, despite the coupling to the\nenvironment. This situation is called \"partial decoherence\". Here we find the\nconditions for partial decoherence for a mesoscopic system (with $N$ quantum\nstates) which is coupled to an environment. When the Hamiltonian of the system\ncommutes with the total Hamiltonian, one has \"adiabatic decoherence\", which\nyields N-1 time-independent combinations of the reduced density matrix\nelements. In the presence of a magnetic flux, one can measure circulating\ncurrents around loops in the system even at long times, and use them to\nretrieve information on the initial state.

The curved cavity system\nresolves the quandary of the conventional mechanical system where the\nBose-Einstein distribution requires higher frequencies for lower quantum\noccupation factors contrary to the constraint of an inverse frequency\ndependence of the quantum fluctuations of displacement. We demonstrate how the\nnon-trivial cavity geometry can lead to better phonon trapping, enhancing the\nvariance of zero-point-fluctuations of displacement. This variance becomes\nindependent of overtone number (or BAW resonance frequency) overcoming the\nconstraint and allowing better observation of quantum effects in a mechanical\nsystem. The piezoelectric electro-mechanical coupling approach is qualitatively\ncompared to the parametric optomechanical technique for the curved BAW\ncavities. In both cases the detectible quantity grows proportional to the\nsquare root of the overtone number, and thus the resonance frequency. Also, the\nphonon trapping improves with higher overtone numbers, which allows the\nelectrode size to be reduced such that in the optimal case the parasitic\ncapacitive impedance becomes independent of the overtone number, allowing\neffective coupling to very high frequency overtones. \n\n"}

However, due to the\nlack of energy conservation and heating effects, non-trivial (e.g.,\ntopological) many-body states in periodically driven (Floquet) systems are\ngenerally metastable. Therefore it is necessary to find strategies for\npreparing long-lived many-body states in Floquet systems. We develop a\ntheoretical framework for describing the dynamical preparation of states in\nFloquet systems by a slow turn-on of the drive. We find that the dynamics of\nthe system is well approximated by the initial state evolving under a slowly\nvarying effective Hamiltonian $H_{\\rm eff}^{(s)}(t)$, provided the ramp speed\n$s \\gg t_*^{-1} \\sim e^{-{\\mathcal{C} \\frac{\\omega}{J}}}$, the inverse of the\ncharacteristic heating time-scale in the Floquet system. At such ramp speeds,\nthe heating effects due to the drive are exponentially suppressed. We compute\nthe slowly varying effective Hamiltonian $H_{\\rm eff}^{(s)}(t)$, and show that\nat the end of the ramp it is identical to the effective Hamiltonian of the\nunramped Floquet system, up to small corrections of the order $O(s)$.\nTherefore, the system effectively undergoes a slow quench from $H_0$ to $H_{\\rm\neff}$. As an application, we consider the passage of the slow quench through a\nquantum critical point (QCP), and estimate the energy absorbed due to the\nnon-adiabatic passage through the QCP via a Kibble-Zurek mechanism. By\nminimizing the energy absorbed due to both the drive and the ramp, we find an\noptimal ramp speed $s_* \\sim t_*^{-z/({d+2z})}$ for which both heating effects\nare exponentially suppressed. Our results bridge the gap between the numerous\nproposals to obtain interesting systems via Floquet engineering, and the actual\npreparation of such systems in their effective ground states. \n\n"}

The method focuses on excitations within the lowest Landau level,\nand corresponds to a quantum version of the harmonic approximation. For pure\nsystems (no disorder), the method reproduces known results for the collective\nmode density of states of this system, and clearly identifies the origin of\npreviously unexplained structure in this quantity. The application of the\nmethod to a simple diagonal disorder model uncovers a surprising result: a\nsharp (delta-function) response at zero temperature that is consistent with\nrecent experiments. A simple spin lattice model is developed that reproduces\nthe results of the quantum harmonic approximation, and shows that the sharp\nresponse is possible because the size scale $L_c$ of patches moving together in\nthe lowest frequency collective mode is extremely large compared to the sample\nsize for physically relevant parameters. This result is found to be a direct\nrepercussion of the long-range nature of the Coulomb interaction. Finally, the\nmodel is used to analyze different disorder potentials that may pin the Wigner\ncrystal, and it is argued that interface disorder is likely to represent the\ndominant pinning source for the system. A simple model of the interface is\nshown to reproduce some of the experimental trends for the magnetic field\ndependence of the pinning resonance. \n\n"}

We find that the nature of\nscreening, as treated within our non-linear model, is significantly different\nfrom that of the various linear screening treatments, and the orthogonality of\nfree carrier states with the bound electron states has a profound effect on the\nscreening charge. We find that the electron and hole remain bound for all\ndensities up to about 3 x 10^6 cm^{-1} and that, as n_e increases from zero,\ntrion and even ``quadron'' formation becomes allowed. \n\n"}
