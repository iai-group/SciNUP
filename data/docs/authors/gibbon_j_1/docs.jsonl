The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be converted\ninto heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETIC\nCASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space and\nvelocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each of\nthe physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematically\nreduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the \"inertial range\" above the\nion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenic\nfluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisional\nand collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,\nwhich obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associated\nwith the Alfvenic component. In the \"dissipation range\" between the ion and\nelectron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave\n(KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passive\nphase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings the\nenergy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionless\nwave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in the\nphase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at the\nelectron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scaling\nrelations are derived for these cascades. Astrophysical and space-physical\napplications are discussed in detail. \n\n"}

Due to the asymmetric topology, the synchronous patterns formed\nin complex networks are irregular and nonstationary. For coupling strength\nimmediately out of the synchronizable region, the typical phenomenon is the\non-off intermittency of the system dynamics. The patterns appeared in this\nprocess are signatured by the coexistence of a giant cluster, which comprises\nmost of the nodes, and a few number of small clusters. The pattern evolution is\ncharacterized by the giant cluster irregularly absorbs or emits the small\nclusters. As the coupling strength leaves away from the synchronization\nbifurcation point, the giant cluster is gradually dissolved into a number of\nsmall clusters, and the system dynamics is characterized by the integration and\nseparation of the small clusters. Dynamical mechanisms and statistical\nproperties of the nonstationary pattern evolution are analyzed and conducted,\nand some scalings are newly revealed. Remarkably, it is found that the few\nactive nodes, which escape from the giant cluster with a high frequency, are\nindependent of the coupling strength while are sensitive to the bifurcation\ntypes. We hope our findings about nonstationary pattern could give additional\nunderstandings to the dynamics of complex systems and have implications to some\nreal problems where systems maintain their normal functions only in the\nunsynchronizable state. \n\n"}

This allows sufficient separation of scales to\nobserve a Navier-Stokes (NS) inertial range followed by a 2nd LANS inertial\nrange. The analysis of the third-order structure function scaling supports the\npredicted l^3 scaling; it corresponds to a k^(-1) scaling of the energy\nspectrum. The energy spectrum itself shows a different scaling which goes as\nk^1. This latter spectrum is consistent with the absence of stretching in the\nsub-filter scales due to the Taylor frozen-in hypothesis employed as a closure\nin the derivation of LANS. These two scalings are conjectured to coexist in\ndifferent spatial portions of the flow. The l^3 (E(k) k^(-1)) scaling is\nsubdominant to k^1 in the energy spectrum, but the l^3 scaling is responsible\nfor the direct energy cascade, as no cascade can result from motions with no\ninternal degrees of freedom. We verify the prediction for the size of the LANS\nattractor resulting from this scaling. From this, we give a methodology either\nfor arriving at grid-independent solutions for LANS, or for obtaining a\nformulation of a LES optimal in the context of the alpha models. The fully\nconverged grid-independent LANS may not be the best approximation to a direct\nnumerical simulation of the NS equations since the minimum error is a balance\nbetween truncation errors and the approximation error due to using LANS instead\nof the primitive equations. Furthermore, the small-scale behavior of LANS\ncontributes to a reduction of flux at constant energy, leading to a shallower\nenergy spectrum for large alpha. These small-scale features, do not preclude\nLANS to reproduce correctly the intermittency properties of high Re flow. \n\n"}

Starting from simple, but well known experiments, a\nseries of mathematical modeling tools are introduced, and the relation between\nthem is made clear. First, we show how Brownian motion can be understood in\nterms of a simple random walk model. Normal diffusion is then treated (i)\nthrough formalizing the random walk model and deriving a classical diffusion\nequation, (ii) by using Fick's law that leads again to the same diffusion\nequation, and (iii) by using a stochastic differential equation for the\nparticle dynamics (the Langevin equation), which allows to determine the mean\nsquare displacement of particles. (iv) We discuss normal diffusion from the\npoint of view of probability theory, applying the Central Limit Theorem to the\nrandom walk problem, and (v) we introduce the more general Fokker-Planck\nequation for diffusion that includes also advection. We turn then to anomalous\ndiffusion, discussing first its formal characteristics, and proceeding to\nContinuous Time Random Walk (CTRW) as a model for anomalous diffusion. It is\nshown how CTRW can be treated formally, the importance of probability\ndistributions of the Levy type is explained, and we discuss the relation of\nCTRW to fractional diffusion equations and show how the latter can be derived\nfrom the CTRW equations. Last, we demonstrate how a general diffusion equation\ncan be derived for Hamiltonian systems, and we conclude this tutorial with a\nfew recent applications of the above theories in laboratory and astrophysical\nplasmas. \n\n"}

In\nparticular, a major open issue is whether a purely Markovian statistical\ndescription of hydrodynamic turbulence actually can be achieved. Based on the\nformulation of a \\textit{deterministic inverse kinetic theory} (IKT) for the 3D\nincompressible Navier-Stokes equations, here we claim that such a\n\\textit{Markovian statistical description actually exists}. The approach, which\ninvolves the introduction of the \\textit{local velocity probability density}\nfor the fluid (local pdf) - rather than the velocity-difference pdf adopted in\ncustomary approaches to homogeneous turbulence - relies exclusively on first\nprinciples. These include - in particular - the exact validity of the\nstochastic Navier-Stokes equations, the principle of entropy maximization and a\nconstant H-theorem for the Shannon statistical entropy. As a result, the new\napproach affords an exact equivalence between Lagrangian and Eulerian\nformulations which permit local pdf's which are generally non-Maxwellian (i.e.,\nnon-Gaussian).

In nonlinear electrokinetic phenomena, such as AC\nor induced-charge electro-osmosis (ACEO, ICEO) and induced-charge\nelectrophoresis (ICEP), several Volts $\\approx 100 kT/e$ are applied to\npolarizable surfaces in microscopic geometries, and the resulting electric\nfields and induced surface charges are large enough to violate the assumptions\nof the classical theory. In this article, we review the literature, highlight\ndiscrepancies between theory and experiment, introduce possible modifications\nof the theory, and analyze their consequences. We argue that, in response to a\nlarge applied voltage, the \"compact layer\" and \"shear plane\" effectively\nadvance into the liquid, due to the crowding of counter-ions. Using simple\ncontinuum models, we predict two general trends, each enhanced by dielectric\nresponse: (i) ionic crowding against a blocking surface expands the diffuse\ndouble layer and thus decreases its differential capacitance, and (ii) a\ncharge-induced viscosity increase near the surface reduces the electro-osmotic\nmobility. The first effect is able to predict high-frequency flow reversal in\nACEO pumps, while the second may explain the decay of ICEO flow with increasing\nsalt concentration. Through examples, such as ICEP of an uncharged metal sphere\nin an asymmetric electrolyte, we show that ICEO flows are ion-specific.

According to this\nanalysis, the stable stratification $N^2\\geq0$ has a destabilization mechanism,\nand the flow instability is due to the competition of the kinetic energy with\nthe potential energy, which is dominated by the total Froude number $Fr_t^2$.\nGlobally, $Fr_t^2 \\leq 1$ implies that the total kinetic energy is smaller than\nthe total potential energy. So the potential energy might transfer to the\nkinetic energy after being disturbed, and the flow becomes unstable. On the\nother hand, when the potential energy is smaller than the kinetic energy\n($Fr_t^2>1$), the flow is stable because no potential energy could transfer to\nthe kinetic energy. The flow is more stable with the velocity profile\n$U'/U'''>0$ than that with $U'/U'''<0$. Besides, the unstable perturbation must\nbe long-wave scale. Locally, the flow is unstable as the gradient Richardson\nnumber $Ri>1/4$.

My conclusion is that these experiments show that quantum mechanics is\nnonobjective: that is, the values of physical observables cannot be assigned to\na system before measurement. Bell's assumption of nonlocality has to be\nrejected as having no direct experimental confirmation, at least thus far.

On\ngood agreement with the map's counterpart, while at the onset of chaos this\nexponent vanishes, the subexponential expansion and contraction of network\ndegrees can be fully described via a Tsallis-type scalar deformation of the\nexpansion rate, that yields a discrete spectrum of non-null generalized\nexponents.

Two cases are considered. The first one is the\ncounterflowing (Vinen) turbulence, where the vortex lines are disordered, and\nthe evolution of quantity $\\mathcal{L}(t)$ obeys the Vinen equation. The second\ncase is the quasi-classic turbulence, where vortex lines are believed to form\nthe so called vortex bundles, and their dynamics is described by the HVBK\nequations. The latter case, is of a special interest, since a number of recent\nexperiments demonstrate the $\\omega ^{-5/3}$ dependence for spectrum VLD,\ninstead of $\\omega ^{1/3}$ law, typical for spectrum of vorticity. In\nnonstationary situation, in particular, in the fluctuating turbulent flow there\nis a retardation between the instantaneous value of the normal velocity and the\nquantity $\\mathcal{L}$. This retardation tends to decrease in the accordance\nwith the inner dynamics, which has a relaxation character. In both cases the\nrelaxation dynamics of VLD is related to fluctuations of the relative velocity,\nhowever if for the Vinen case the rate of temporal change for $\\mathcal{L}(t)$\nis directly depends on $\\delta \\mathbf{v}_{ns}$, for the HVBK dynamics it\ndepends on $\\nabla \\times \\delta \\mathbf{v}_{ns}$.

In particular, we prove that the number of independent quadratic\ninvariants is equal to J = N - M* (greater than or equal to N - M), where M* is\nthe number of linearly independent rows in A. Thus, the problem of finding all\nindependent quadratic invariants is reduced to a linear algebra problem in the\nHamiltonian case. We establish that the properties of the quadratic invariants\n(e.g., locality) are related to the topological properties of the clusters\n(e.g., types of linkage).

To determine the collision rate, many\nnumerical studies rely on the 'Ghost Collision Approximation' (GCA), which\nsimply records how often pairs of point particles come within a threshold\ndistance. In many applications, the suspended particles stick (or in the case\nof liquid droplets, coalesce) upon collision, and it is the frequency of first\ncontact which is of interest. If a pair of 'ghost' particles undergoes multiple\ncollisions, the GCA may overestimate the true collision rate. Here, using fully\nresolved Direct Numerical Simulations of turbulent flows at moderate Reynolds\nnumber (R_\\lambda = 130), we investigate the prevalence and properties of\nmultiple collisions. We demonstrate that the GCA leads to a systematic\noverestimate of the collision rate, which is of the order of 15% when the\nparticle inertia is small, and slowly decreases when inertia increases.

Abstract: Giant planets like Jupiter and Saturn feature strong zonal wind patterns on\ntheir surfaces. Although several different mechanisms that may drive these jets\nhave been proposed over the last decades, the origin of the zonal winds is\nstill unclear. Here, we explore the possibility that the interplay of planetary\nrotation with the compression and expansion of the convecting fluid can drive\nmultiple deep zonal jets by a compressional Rhines-type mechanism, as\noriginally proposed by Ingersoll and Pollard (1982). In a certain limit, this\ndeep mechanism is shown to be mathematically analogous to the classical Rhines\nmechanism possibly operating at cloud level. Jets are predicted to occur on a\ncompressional Rhines length $l_R = (2 \\Omega \\langle H_\\rho^{-1} \\rangle\nv_{jet}^{-1} )^{-1/2}$, where $\\Omega$ is the angular velocity, $\\langle\nH_\\rho^{-1} \\rangle$ is the mean inverse density scale height and $v_{jet}$ is\nthe typical jet velocity. Two-dimensional numerical simulations using the\nanelastic approximation reveal that this mechanism robustly generates jets of\nthe predicted width, and that it typically dominates the dynamics in systems\ndeeper than $O(l_R)$. Potential vorticity staircases are observed to form\nspontaneously and are typically accompanied by unstably stratified buoyancy\nstaircases. The mechanism only operates at large rotation rates, exceeding\nthose typically reached in three-dimensional simulations of deep convection in\nspherical shells. Applied to Jupiter and Saturn, the compressional Rhines\nscaling reasonably fits the available observations. Interestingly, even weak\nvertical density variations such as those in the Earth core can give rise to a\nlarge number of jets, leading to fundamentally different flow structures than\npredicted by the Boussinesq models typically used in this context. \n\n"}

The information on the outer dynamics\nis encoded by a geometrically defined map, referred to as the `scattering map'.\n  We find pseudo-orbits of the scattering map that keep advancing in some\nprivileged direction.

Finally, we apply topological methods to show the\nexistence of true orbits that follow the successive applications of the two\ndynamics.\n  This method differs, in several crucial aspects, from earlier works.

Inspired by the recent work for incompressible\nflows [Xu et al., PNAS 111.21 (2014) 7558], we analyze the evolution of the\nkinetic energy for fluid markers and use the fluctuations of the instantaneous\npower as a measure of time irreversibility. For short times, starting from a\nuniform distribution of markers, we find the scaling\n$\\left<[E(t)-E(0)]^n\\right>\\propto t$ and $\\left<p^n\\right> \\propto\n\\textrm{Re}^{n-1}$ for the power as a function of the Reynolds number. Both\nobservations can be explained using the \"flight-crash\" model, suggested by Xu\net al. Furthermore, we use a simple model for shocks which reproduces the\nmoments of the energy difference including the pre-factor for\n$\\left<E(t)-E(0)\\right>$. To complete the single particle picture for Burgers\nwe compute the moments of the Lagrangian velocity difference and show that they\nare bi-fractal.

We additionally\ninvestigate time irreversibility in the long-time limit when all particles are\nlocated inside shocks and the Lagrangian velocity statistics are stationary. We\nfind the same scalings for the power and energy differences as at short times\nand argue that this is also a consequence of rare \"flight-crash\" events related\nto shock collisions. \n\n"}

Working towards\ndeveloping a complete statistical theory for transition strength densities\n(transition strengths multiplied by the density of states at the initial and\nfinal energies), we have started a program to derive formulas for the lower\norder bivariate moments of the strength densities generated by a variety of\ntransition operators. In this paper results are presented for a transition\noperator that removes $k_0$ number of particle by considering $m$ spinless\nfermions in $N$ single particle states. The Hamiltonian that is $k$-body is\nrepresented by EGUE($k$) [embedded Gaussian unitary ensemble of $k$-body\ninteractions] and similarly the transition operator by an appropriate\nindependent EGUE. Employing the embedding $U(N)$ algebra, finite-$N$ formulas\nfor moments up to order four are derived and they show that in general the\nsmoothed (with respect to energy) bivariate transition strength densities take\nbivariate Gaussian form.

At large scales, the PDF of scalar increment behaved similarly to\nthat of scalar fluctuation, while at small scales it resembled the PDF of\nscalar gradient.

However, these\nmethods fail when the relevant coherent structures occur at low energies or at\nmultiple frequencies, which is often the case. To overcome the deficit of these\n\"rigid\" approaches, we propose a new method termed Spectral Proper Orthogonal\nDecomposition (SPOD). It is based on classical POD and it can be applied to\nspatially and temporally resolved data. The new method involves an additional\ntemporal constraint that enables a clear separation of phenomena that occur at\nmultiple frequencies and energies. SPOD allows for a continuous shifting from\nthe energetically optimal POD to the spectrally pure Fourier decomposition by\nchanging a single parameter.

The KD is therefore an important model system for\nunderstanding astrophysical magnetism. Here, the mathematical correspondence\nbetween the KD and a specific stochastic differential equation (SDE) viewed\nfrom the perspective of the supersymmetric theory of stochastics (STS) is\ndiscussed. The STS is a novel, approximation-free framework to investigate\nSDEs. The correspondence reported here permits insights from the STS to be\napplied to the theory of KD and vice versa. It was previously known that the\nfast KD in the idealistic limit of no magnetic diffusion requires chaotic\nflows. The KD-STS correspondence shows that this is also true for the diffusive\nKD. From the STS perspective, the KD possesses a topological supersymmetry and\nthe dynamo effect can be viewed as its spontaneous breakdown. This\nsupersymmetry breaking can be regarded as the stochastic generalization of the\nconcept of dynamical chaos. As this supersymmetry breaking happens in both the\ndiffusive and the non-diffusive case, the necessity of the underlying SDE being\nchaotic is given in either case. The observed exponentially growing and\noscillating KD modes prove physically that dynamical spectra of the STS\nevolution operator that break the topological supersymmetry exist with both,\nreal and complex ground state eigenvalues.

We address this question by considering stationary states,\nwhich provide the simplest examples of wave functions with stationary nodes. We\nprovide examples of stationary wave functions for which there is chaos, as\ndemonstrated by numerical computations, for one particle moving in 3 spatial\ndimensions and for two and three entangled particles in two dimensions. Our\nconclusion is that the motion of the nodes is not necessary for the generation\nof chaos.

The important similarities\ninclude basic equations, ideal quadratic invariants, cascades and the role of\nlinear elastic waves. Surface tension induces elasticity, and the balance\nbetween surface tension energy and turbulent kinetic energy determines a length\nscale (Hinze scale) of the system.

The efficacy of delay-coordinate mapping has long been\nsupported by Takens' embedding theorem, which guarantees that delay-coordinate\nmaps use the time-series output to provide a reconstruction of the hidden state\nspace that is a one-to-one embedding of the system's attractor. While this\ntopological guarantee ensures that distinct points in the reconstruction\ncorrespond to distinct points in the original state space, it does not\ncharacterize the quality of this embedding or illuminate how the specific\nparameters affect the reconstruction. In this paper, we extend Takens' result\nby establishing conditions under which delay-coordinate mapping is guaranteed\nto provide a stable embedding of a system's attractor. Beyond only preserving\nthe attractor topology, a stable embedding preserves the attractor geometry by\nensuring that distances between points in the state space are approximately\npreserved. In particular, we find that delay-coordinate mapping stably embeds\nan attractor of a dynamical system if the stable rank of the system is large\nenough to be proportional to the dimension of the attractor.

This model is also of broader interest because it is quite\nclosely related to mathematical models of other self-pulsing systems, such as\nexcitable spiking neurons.\n  We perform a numerical bifurcation analysis of the Yamada model with delay,\nwhere we consider both the feedback delay, the feedback strength and the\nstrength of pumping as bifurcation parameters.

In situations where a\nsystem is time varying, one would like to update the system's description\nonline as time evolves. This work provides an efficient method for computing\nDMD in real time, updating the approximation of a system's dynamics as new data\nbecomes available. The algorithm does not require storage of past data, and\ncomputes the exact DMD matrix using rank-1 updates. A weighting factor that\nplaces less weight on older data can be incorporated in a straightforward\nmanner, making the method particularly well suited to time-varying systems. A\nvariant of the method may also be applied to online computation of \"windowed\nDMD\", in which only the most recent data are used. The efficiency of the method\nis compared against several existing DMD algorithms: for problems in which the\nstate dimension is less than about~200, the proposed algorithm is the most\nefficient for real-time computation, and it can be orders of magnitude more\nefficient than the standard DMD algorithm. The method is demonstrated on\nseveral examples, including a time-varying linear system and a more complex\nexample using data from a wind tunnel experiment.

As shown, even in pipes several thousand\ndiameters long, the spatio-temporal intermittent flow patterns observed at the\nend of the pipe strongly depend on the initial conditions, with no indication\nof an approach to a (statistical) steady state. Exploiting the fact that\nturbulent puffs do not age, we continuously recreate the puff sequence exiting\nthe pipe at the entrance, thus introducing periodic boundary conditions for the\nflow pattern. This procedure allows us to study the evolution of the flow\npatterns for arbitrary long times. We find that after times in excess of $10^7$\nadvective time units, a statistical steady state is reached. Though the\nresulting flows remain spatio-temporally intermittent, puff splitting and decay\nrates eventually reach a balance so that the turbulent fraction fluctuates\naround a well defined level which only depends on $Re$. We find that at lower\n$Re$ (here 2020), flows eventually always laminarize, while for higher $Re$\n($>=2060$) turbulence persists. The critical point for pipe flow hence lies in\nthe interval $2020<Re_c<2060$, which is in good agreement with the recently\nproposed value of $Re_c=2040$.

Unlike typical contact\nprocesses where such interactions strongly affect the critical point, in pipe\nflow it is only marginally influenced.

The latter is the flux through a dividing\nsurface (DS) between the two corresponding regions and it is exact only if it\nis free of recrossings. For time-independent barriers, the DS can be attached\nto the top of the corresponding saddle point of the potential energy surface,\nand in time-dependent systems, the DS is a moving object. The precise\ndetermination of reaction rates, eg using transition state theory, requires the\nactual construction of a DS for a given saddle geometry which is in general a\ndemanding methodical and computational task, especially in high-dimensional\nsystems. In this paper, we demonstrate how such time-dependent, global, and\nrecrossing-free DSs can be constructed using neural networks. In our approach,\nthe neural network uses the bath coordinates and time as input and it is\ntrained in a way that its output provides the position of the DS along the\nreaction coordinate. An advantage of this procedure is that, once the neural\nnetwork is trained, the complete information about the dynamical phase space\nseparation is stored in the network's parameters, and a precise distinction\nbetween reactants and products can be made for all possible system\nconfigurations, all times, and with little computational effort.

For a given dynamical system in a certain region of phase\nspace with transient chaos, trajectories eventually abandon the chaotic region\nescaping to an external attractor, if no external intervention is done on the\nsystem. In some situations, this attractor may involve an undesirable behavior,\nso the application of a control in the system is necessary to avoid it. Both,\nthe nonattractive nature of transient chaos and eventually the presence of\nnoise may hinder this task. Recently, a new method to control chaos called\n\\emph{partial control} has been developed. The method is based on the existence\nof a set, called the safe set, that allows to sustain transient chaos by only\nusing a small amount of control. The surprising result is that the trajectories\ncan be controlled by using an amount of control smaller than the amount of\nnoise affecting it. We present here a broad survey of results of this control\nmethod applied to a wide variety of dynamical systems. We also review here all\nthe variations of the partial control method that have been developed so far.\nIn all the cases various systems of different dimensionality are treated in\norder to see the potential of this method.

Shared information flow exists when\nX's past is predictive of Y's present in the same manner as Y's past; this\noccurs due to synchronization or common driving, for example. Finally,\nsynergistic information flow occurs when neither X's nor Y's pasts are\npredictive of Y's present on their own, but taken together they are.

Using these results and knowing\nthe parameterizations of surface friction and thermal radiation in Held-Suarez\nphysics, the contribution of each physical process (meridional and vertical\neddy fluxes, surface friction, thermal radiation, and meridional advection) to\nthe annular mode dynamics is quantified. Examining the quasi-geostrophic\npotential vorticity balance, it is shown that the eddy feedback is positive and\nincreases the persistence of the annular mode by a factor of more than two.\nFurthermore, how eddy fluxes change in response to only the barotropic\ncomponent of the annular mode, i.e., vertically averaged zonal wind (and no\ntemperature) anomaly, is also calculated similarly.

The values of\nthe particles' relative density (1.5) and of the Galileo number (180) are such\nthat strong wake-induced particle clustering would occur in the absence of\nturbulence. The forced turbulence in the two present cases (with Taylor-scale\nReynolds number 95 and 140) would lead to mild levels of clustering in the\nabsence of gravity.

However, the clustering strength does not monotonously\ndecay with the relative turbulence intensity. Various mechanisms by which\ncoherent structures can affect particle motion are discussed.

The proposed approach regularizes the equations at the\nlevel of the partial differential equation and as a result, any numerical\nmethod can be used to solve the system of equations. The regularization is\naccomplished by introducing an 'observability limit' that represents the length\nscale below which one cannot properly model or continue to resolve flow\nstructures.

Instead of relying on externally-induced flow or probe motion, we\nsuggest that colloidal diffusivity near solid surfaces contains signatures of\nthe degree of fluid slip exhibited on those surfaces. To investigate, we\ncalculate the image system for point forces (Stokeslets) oriented perpendicular\nand parallel to a surface with a finite slip length, analogous to Blake's\nsolution for a Stokeslet near a no-slip wall. Notably, the image system for the\npoint source and perpendicular Stokeslet contain the same singularities as\nBlake's solution; however, each is distributed along a line with a magnitude\nthat decays exponentially over the slip length. The image system for the\nparallel Stokeslet involves a larger set of fundamental singularities, whose\nmagnitude does not decay exponentially from the surface.

Numerically it is found that such a division is\nimportant in understanding many properties of both eigenstates and the\nso-called local spectral density of states (LDOS).

A relationship between the average shape of eigenstates\nand that of LDOS can be explained.

Abstract: The plane wave decomposition method (PWDM) is one of the most popular\nstrategies for numerical solution of the quantum billiard problem. The method\nis based on the assumption that each eigenstate in a billiard can be\napproximated by a superposition of plane waves at a given energy. By the\nclassical results on the theory of differential operators this can indeed be\njustified for billiards in convex domains. On the contrary, in the present work\nwe demonstrate that eigenstates of non-convex billiards, in general, cannot be\napproximated by any solution of the Helmholtz equation regular everywhere in\n$\\R^2$ (in particular, by linear combinations of a finite number of plane waves\nhaving the same energy). From this we infer that PWDM cannot be applied to\nbilliards in non-convex domains. Furthermore, it follows from our results that\nunlike the properties of integrable billiards, where each eigenstate can be\nextended into the billiard exterior as a regular solution of the Helmholtz\nequation, the eigenstates of non-convex billiards, in general, do not admit\nsuch an extension. \n\n"}

This model involves a\nspace and time discretization of the dynamics and depends on only two\nparameters: the fraction of space-time occupied by rotating structures of the\ncarrier flow and the rate at which particles are ejected from them. The latter\ncan be heuristically related to the response time of the particles and hence\nmeasure their inertia. It is shown that such a model reproduces qualitatively\nmost aspects of the spatial distribution of heavy particles transported by\nrealistic flows. In particular the probability density function of the mass $m$\nin a cell displays an power-law behavior at small values and decreases faster\nthan exponentially at large values. The dependence of the exponent of the first\ntail upon the parameters of the dynamics is explicitly derived for the model.\nThe right tail is shown to decrease as $\\exp (-C m \\log m)$.

For sufficiently\nlarge N, one can distinguish two different `kinds' of chaos. Short range\nmicrochaos, associated with close encounters between charges, is a generic\nfeature, yielding large positive Lyapunov exponents X_N which do not decrease\nwith increasing N even if the bulk potential is integrable.

We do not use any\nassumptions on particular \"classical\", \"macroscopic\", \"stochastic\", etc. nature\nof the instrument or environment: physical reduction and indeterminacy\ndynamically appear already in interaction between two microscopic (quantum)\ndeterministic systems, the object and the instrument, possessing just a few\ndegrees of freedom a part of which, belonging to the instrument, should\ncorrespond to locally starting, arbitrarily weak excitation. This dynamically\nindeterminate wave reduction occurs in agreement with the postulates of the\nconventional quantum mechanics, including the rule of probabilities, which\ntransforms them into consequences of the dynamic uncertainty. \n\n"}
{"id": "quant-ph/9805078", "contents": "Title: New Concept of Dynamic Complexity in Quantum Mechanics and Beyond Abstract: The qualitatively new concept of dynamic complexity in quantum mechanics is\nbased on a new paradigm appearing within a nonperturbational analysis of the\nSchroedinger equation for a generic Hamiltonian system. The unreduced analysis\nexplicitly provides the complete, consistent solution as a set of many\nincompatible components ('realisations') which should permanently and\nprobabilistically replace one another, since each of them is 'complete' in the\nordinary sense. This discovery leads to the universally applicable concept of\ndynamic complexity and self-consistent, realistic resolution of the stagnating\nproblems of quantum chaos, quantum measurement, indeterminacy and wave\nreduction. The peculiar, 'mysterious' character of quantum behaviour itself is\nseen now as a result of a dynamically complex, intrinsically multivalued\nbehaviour of interacting fields at the corresponding lowest levels of the (now\ncompletely causal) structure of reality. Incorporating the results of the\ncanonical theories as an over-simplified limiting case, this new approach\nurgently needs support, since its causality and completeness are directly\nextendible to arbitrary cases of complex behaviour of real systems, in sharp\ncontrast to the dominating inefficient empiricism of 'computer experimentation'\nwith primitive mechanistic (i. e. dynamically single-valued) 'models' of the\nirreducibly multivalued reality. \n\n"}

Since these quantities depend on the choice of the eigenbasis, we\nsuggest to use the overcomplete basis of coherent states, uniquely determined\nby the classical phase space.

We note that this is the case\nirrespective of the value, $I$, of the generating Hamiltonian which is a\nconstant of motion. For $I < 0$ we find numerous closed orbits with two\nunstable eigenvalues strongly indicating that there cannot exist two additional\nfirst integrals apart from the Hamiltonian and thus that the system, at least\nfor this case, is very likely not integrable. In addition, we present numerical\nevidence that the average Lyapunov exponent nevertheless vanishes. The model is\nthus a very interesting example of a Hamiltonian dynamical system, which is\nlikely non-integrable yet passes the reduced Painlev\\'{e} test. \n\n"}
