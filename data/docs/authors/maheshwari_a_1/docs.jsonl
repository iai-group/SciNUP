For instance, the nodes could correspond to neurons along the\ncortical surface and the vector field could correspond to the gradient of\nneurotrophic factors, or the nodes could represent towns while the vector\nfields would be given by economical and/or geographical gradients. Therefore\ntrajectory networks are natural models of a large number of geographical\nstructures.

As such, these infiltrations\ncould be related to several real-world processes such as contaminations,\ndiseases, attacks, parasites, etc. The way in which progressive geographical\ninfiltrations affect trajectory networks is investigated in terms of the\ndegree, clustering coefficient, size of the largest component and the lengths\nof the existing chains measured along the infiltrations.

With an\nodds-on tree, the expected query time for a point drawn according to D is\nO(H*+1), where H* is a lower-bound on the expected cost of any linear decision\ntree that solves P.\n  Odds-on trees have a number of applications, including distribution-sensitive\ndata structures for point location in 2-d, point-in-polytope testing in d\ndimensions, ray shooting in simple polygons, ray shooting in polytopes,\nnearest-neighbour queries in R^d, point-location in arrangements of hyperplanes\nin R^d, and many other geometric searching problems that can be solved in the\nlinear-decision tree model.

It is\nwidely used because it encodes useful information about the topology of the\nunderlying metric space. This information is often extracted from its so-called\npersistence diagram. Unfortunately, this filtration is often too large to\nconstruct in full. We show how to construct an O(n)-size filtered simplicial\ncomplex on an $n$-point metric space such that its persistence diagram is a\ngood approximation to that of the Vietoris-Rips filtration. This new filtration\ncan be constructed in $O(n\\log n)$ time.

As a consequence, the\nsolutions of Kolmogorov PDEs are smooth at all positive times if the\ncoefficients of the PDE are smooth and satisfy H\\\"{o}rmander's condition even\nif the initial function is only continuous but not differentiable. First-order\nlinear Kolmogorov PDEs with smooth coefficients do not have this smoothing\neffect but at least preserve regularity in the sense that solutions are smooth\nif their initial functions are smooth. In this article, we consider the\nintermediate regime of nonhypoelliptic second-order Kolmogorov PDEs with smooth\ncoefficients. The main observation of this article is that there exist\ncounterexamples to regularity preservation in that case. More precisely, we\ngive an example of a second-order linear Kolmogorov PDE with globally bounded\nand smooth coefficients and a smooth initial function with compact support such\nthat the unique globally bounded viscosity solution of the PDE is not even\nlocally H\\\"{o}lder continuous.

In this paper we demonstrate a simple\nunconventional computation method to approximate the Euclidean TSP using a\nvirtual material approach.

A `blob' of this material is placed over a\nset of data points projected into the lattice, representing TSP city locations,\nand the blob is reduced in size over time. As the blob shrinks it\nmorphologically adapts to the configuration of the cities. The shrinkage\nprocess automatically stops when the blob no longer completely covers all\ncities. By manually tracing the perimeter of the blob a path between cities is\nelicited corresponding to a TSP tour.

But, checking the link condition involves computation in\nall dimensions, and hence can be costly, especially in high dimensional\ncomplexes. We define a weaker and more local condition called the p-link\ncondition for each dimension p, and study its effect on edge contractions. We\nprove the following: (i) For homology groups, edges satisfying the p- and\n(p-1)-link conditions can be contracted without disturbing the p-dimensional\nhomology group.

Computing it has been shown to be NP-hard by\n[Thomassen '89 & '93], and it is known to be fixed-parameter tractable.\nHowever, the approximability of the Euler genus is wide open. While the\nexistence of an O(1)-approximation is not ruled out, only an\nO(sqrt(n))-approximation [Chen, Kanchi, Kanevsky '97] is known even in bounded\ndegree graphs. In this paper we give a polynomial-time algorithm which on input\na bounded-degree graph of Euler genus g, computes a drawing into a surface of\nEuler genus poly(g, log(n)). Combined with the upper bound from [Chen, Kanchi,\nKanevsky '97], our result also implies a O(n^(1/2 - alpha))-approximation, for\nsome constant alpha>0.\n  Using our algorithm for approximating the Euler genus as a subroutine, we\nobtain, in a unified fashion, algorithms with approximation ratios of the form\npoly(OPT, log(n)) for several related problems on bounded degree graphs. These\ninclude the problems of orientable genus, crossing number, and planar edge and\nvertex deletion problems.

However, computing optimal paths in the context of\ndiffuse or specular reflections does not seem to be an easy task. A path from a\nlight source $s$ to $t$ inside $P$ is called a diffuse reflection path if the\nturning points of the path lie in the interiors of the boundary edges of $P$. A\ndiffuse reflection path is said to be optimal if it has the minimum number of\nturning points amongst all diffuse reflection paths between $s$ and $t$. The\nminimum diffuse reflection path may not be simple. The problem of computing the\nminimum diffuse reflection path in low degree polynomial time has remained\nopen.\n  In our quest for understanding the geometric structure of the minimum diffuse\nreflection paths vis-a-vis shortest paths and minimum link paths, we define a\nnew kind of diffuse reflection path called a constrained diffuse reflection\npath where (i) the path is simple, (ii) it intersects only the eaves of the\nEuclidean shortest path between $s$ and $t$, and (iii) it intersects each eave\nexactly once.

An interesting special case, that\nmay prove use- ful to tackling the general problem, is the\ndiagonal-intersecting case, in which the given family of rectangles is\nintersected by a diagonal. Indeed, Chepoi and Felsner recently gave a factor 6\napproximation algorithm for MHS in this setting, and showed that the duality\ngap is between 3/2 and 6. In this paper we improve upon these results. First we\nshow that MIS in diagonal-intersecting families is NP-complete, providing one\nsmallest subclass for which MIS is provably hard. Then, we derive an\n$O(n^2)$-time algorithm for the maximum weight independent set when, in\naddition the rectangles intersect below the diagonal. This improves and extends\na classic result of Lubiw, and amounts to obtain a 2-approximation algo- rithm\nfor the maximum weight independent set of rectangles intersecting a diagonal.\nFinally, we prove that for diagonal-intersecting families the duality gap is\nbetween 2 and 4.

We introduce the concept of the orbit\nof an edge $e$, which is the set of all edges reachable from $e$ via flips.\n  We establish the first upper and lower bounds on the diameter of the flip\ngraph in this setting. Specifically, we prove tight $\\Theta(n \\log n)$ bounds\nfor edge-labelled triangulations of $n$-vertex convex polygons and\ncombinatorial triangulations, contrasting with the $\\Theta(n)$ bounds in their\nrespective unlabelled settings. The $\\Omega(n \\log n)$ lower bound for the\nconvex polygon setting might be of independent interest, as it generalizes\nlower bounds on certain sorting models. When simultaneous flips are allowed,\nthe upper bound for convex polygons decreases to $O(\\log^2 n)$, although we no\nlonger have a matching lower bound.\n  Moving beyond convex polygons, we show that edge-labelled triangulated\npolygons with a single reflex vertex can have a disconnected flip graph. This\nis in sharp contrast with the unlabelled case, where the flip graph is\nconnected for any triangulated polygon. For spiral polygons, we provide a\ncomplete characterization of the orbits.

In this paper we develop a general\ntechnique for computing the number of crossing-free structures of an input set\n$P$. We apply the technique to obtain algorithms for computing the number of\ntriangulations, matchings, and spanning cycles of $P$. The running time of our\nalgorithms is upper bounded by $n^{O(k)}$, where $k$ is the number of onion\nlayers of $P$. In particular, for $k = O(1)$ our algorithms run in polynomial\ntime. In addition, we show that our algorithm for counting triangulations is\nnever slower than $O^{*}(3.1414^{n})$, even when $k = \\Theta(n)$. Given that\nthere are several well-studied configurations of points with at least\n$\\Omega(3.464^{n})$ triangulations, and some even with $\\Omega(8^{n})$\ntriangulations, our algorithm asymptotically outperforms any enumeration\nalgorithm for such instances.

Previous work on the nubot model showed how\nto build simple shapes such as lines and squares quickly---in expected time\nthat is merely logarithmic of their size.

If G the boundary of a three dimensional graph H for example, we can\nrefine the interior until it is colourable with 4 colours. The later goal is\nachieved if all interior edge degrees are even. Using a refinement process\nwhich cuts the interior along surfaces we can adapt the degrees along the\nboundary of that surface. More efficient is a self-cobordism of G with itself\nwith a host graph discretizing the product of G with an interval. It follows\nfrom the fact that Euler curvature is zero everywhere for three dimensional\ngeometric graphs, that the odd degree edge set O is a cycle and so a boundary\nif H is simply connected. A reduction to minimal colouring would imply the four\ncolour theorem. The method is expected to give a reason \"why 4 colours suffice\"\nand suggests that every two dimensional geometric graph of arbitrary degree and\norientation can be coloured by 5 colours: since the projective plane can not be\na boundary of a 3-dimensional graph and because for higher genus surfaces, the\ninterior H is not simply connected, we need in general to embed a surface into\na 4-dimensional simply connected graph in order to colour it.

Also once you have calculated all the prime numbers\nless than n digits, it is very easy to find out if a given number having less\nthan n-digits is or is not a prime. We do this by separating all the primes\nwhich are represented by points in n-dimension space by planes. It so turns out\nthat the number of planes q, required to separate all the points represented by\nprimes less than n-digit, are very few in number. Thus we obtain a very\nefficient storage and retrieval system in n-dimensional space. In addition the\nstorage and retieval repository has the property that when new primes are added\nthere is no need to start all over, we can begin where we last left off and add\nthe new primes in the repository and add new planes that separate them as and\nwhen necessary.

The conjectured hardness of\nthese problems have become extremely popular for basing conditional lower\nbounds for numerous algorithmic problems in P.\n  In this paper, we show that the randomized $4$-linear decision tree\ncomplexity of 3SUM is $O(n^{3/2})$, and that the randomized $(2k-2)$-linear\ndecision tree complexity of $k$-SUM and $k$-LDT is $O(n^{k/2})$, for any odd\n$k\\ge 3$.

On the other hand,\nalgorithms of the second kind typically rely on the formulation of the\nsemi-discrete optimal transport problem as an unconstrained convex optimization\nproblem which is solved using a Newton or quasi-Newton method.\n  The purpose of this article is to bridge this gap between theory and practice\nby introducing a damped Newton's algorithm which is experimentally efficient\nand by proving the global convergence of this algorithm with optimal rates. The\nmain assumptions is that the cost function satisfies a condition that appears\nin the regularity theory for optimal transport (the Ma-Trudinger-Wang\ncondition) and that the support of the source density is connected in a\nquantitative way (it must satisfy a weighted Poincar\\'e-Wirtinger inequality). \n\n"}

We then apply a\nvariant of a technique of Aronov and Sharir to eliminate these depth cycles by\nmaking a small number of cuts, which corresponds to a small number of cuts to\nthe original planar arrangement of curves. After these cuts have been\nperformed, the resulting curves form a collection of pseudo-segments.\n  Our cutting bound leads to new incidence bounds between points and\nconstant-degree algebraic curves.

We focus on graphs that can be represented by a single\nobstacle. Given a (topologically open) polygon $C$ and a finite set $P$ of\npoints in general position in the complement of $C$, the visibility graph\n$G_C(P)$ has a vertex for each point in $P$ and an edge $pq$ for any two points\n$p$ and $q$ in $P$ that can see each other, that is, $\\overline{pq} \\cap\nC=\\emptyset$. We draw $G_C(P)$ straight-line. Given a graph $G$, we want to\ncompute an obstacle representation of $G$, that is, an obstacle $C$ and a set\nof points $P$ such that $G=G_C(P)$. The complexity of this problem is open,\neven for the case that the points are exactly the vertices of a simple polygon\nand the obstacle is the complement of the polygon-the simple-polygon visibility\ngraph problem. There are two types of obstacles; an inside obstacle lies in a\nbounded component of the complement of the visibility drawing, whereas an\noutside obstacle lies in the unbounded component.\n  We show that the class of graphs with an inside-obstacle representation is\nincomparable with the class of graphs that have an outside-obstacle\nrepresentation. We further show that any graph with at most seven vertices or\ncircumference at most 6 has an outside-obstacle representation, which does not\nhold for a specific graph with 8 vertices and circumference 8. Finally, we\nconsider the outside-obstacle graph sandwich problem: given graphs $G$ and $H$\non the same vertex set, is there a graph $K$ such that $G \\subseteq K \\subseteq\nH$ and $K$ has an outside-obstacle representation? We show that this problem is\nNP-hard even for co-bipartite graphs. With slight modifications, our proof also\nshows that the inside-obstacle graph sandwich problem, the single-obstacle\ngraph sandwich problem, and the simple-polygon visibility graph sandwich\nproblem are all NP-hard. \n\n"}

We do not consider dynamic constraint solvers, also known as\ndynamic geometry programs, in which specific geometric elements are moved,\ninteractively or along prescribed trajectories, while continually maintaining\nall stipulated constraints. However, if we have a solver for static constraint\nproblems that is sufficiently fast and competent, we can build a dynamic\ngeometry program from it by solving the static problem for a sufficiently dense\nsampling of the trajectory of the moving element(s). The work we survey has its\nroots in applications, especially in mechanical computer-aided design (MCAD).\nThe constraint solvers used in MCAD took a quantum leap in the 1990s. These\napproaches solve a geometric constraint problem by an initial, graph-based\nstructural analysis that extracts generic subproblems and determines how they\nwould combine to form a complete solution. These subproblems are then handed to\nan algebraic solver that solves the specific instances of the generic\nsubproblems and combines them. \n\n"}

One\nreason is that there have been few tools to analyse the structure of\ncomplicated paths in the plane. This paper provides a number of such tools. A\nsecond reason is that almost every obvious and small generalisation to the\nmodel (e.g. allowing error, 3D, non-square tiles, signals/wires on tiles, tiles\nthat repel each other, parallel synchronous growth) endows it with great\ncomputational, and sometimes simulation, power.

Adding\nirreversible perturbations to the drift of a Langevin diffusion that maintain\nthe same invariant measure accelerates its convergence to stationarity. Many\nexisting works thus advocate the use of such non-reversible dynamics for\nsampling. When implementing Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms (MCMC) using\ntime discretisations of such Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs), one can\nappend the discretization with the usual Metropolis-Hastings accept-reject step\nand this is often done in practice because the accept--reject step eliminates\nbias. On the other hand, such a step makes the resulting chain reversible. It\nis not known whether adding the accept-reject step preserves the faster mixing\nproperties of the non-reversible dynamics. In this paper, we address this gap\nbetween theory and practice by analyzing the optimal scaling of MCMC algorithms\nconstructed from proposal moves that are time-step Euler discretisations of an\nirreversible SDE, for high dimensional Gaussian target measures.

We show how to analyze this method by looking at it as an application\nof the theories of composition operators, of matrix representa- tion of\noperators on separable Hilbert spaces, and of the theory of the Finite Section\nMethod. These are three well known fruitful topics in functional analysis. When\napplied to the task of modelling of correspondences of shapes in\nthree-dimensional space, these concepts lead directly to functional maps and\nits associated functional matrices. Mathematically spoken, functional maps are\ncomposition operators between two-dimensional manifolds, and functional\nmatrices are infinite matrix representations of such maps. We present an\nintroduction into the notion and theoretical foundation of the functional\nanalytic framework of the theory of matrix repre- sentation, especially of\ncomposition operators.

When the number of events is large, however, NR\ncalculation is time consuming and how these pairs are organized are not yet\nexplored. In this paper, we designed a new approach to calculate clusters of NR\nevents efficiently. To begin with, R-tree is utilized to index crime events, a\nsingle event is represented by a vertex whereas edges are constructed by range\nquerying the vertex in R-tree, and a graph is formed. Cohesive subgraph\napproaches are applied to identify the event chains. k-clique, k-truss, k-core\nplus DBSCAN algorithms are implemented in sequence with respect to their varied\nrange of ability to find cohesive subgraphs.

The procedure for generating the quad mesh is to (i)\nfind a complex-valued \"representation\" field that minimizes the Ginzburg-Landau\nenergy subject to a boundary constraint, (ii) convert the representation field\ninto a boundary-aligned, smooth cross field, (iii) use separatrices of the\ncross field to partition the domain into four sided regions, and (iv) mesh each\nof these four-sided regions using standard techniques.

The\nproblems studied have several connections to other subjects and practical\napplications.\n  The first part of the thesis is concerned with orthogonal art galleries. A\nsharp extremal bound is proved on partitioning orthogonal polygons into at most\n8-vertex polygons using established techniques in the field of art gallery\nproblems. This fills in the gap between already known results for partitioning\ninto at most 6- and 10-vertex orthogonal polygons.\n  Next, these techniques are further developed to prove a new type of extremal\nart gallery result. The novelty provided by this approach is that it\nestablishes a connection between mobile and stationary guards. This theorem has\nstrong computational consequences, in fact, it provides the basis for an\n$\\frac83$-approximation algorithm for guarding orthogonal polygons with\nrectangular vision.\n  In the second part, the graph theoretical concept of terminal-pairability is\nstudied in complete and complete grid graphs. Once again, the extremal approach\nis conductive to discovering efficient methods to solve the problem.\n  In the case of a complete base graph, the new demonstrated lower bound on the\nmaximum degree of realizable demand graphs is 4 times higher than previous best\nresults. The techniques developed are then used to solve the classical extremal\nedge number problem for the terminal-pairability problem in complete base\ngraphs.\n  The complete grid base graph lies on the other end of the spectrum in terms\ndensity amongst path-pairable graphs.

Abstract: Given a set of obstacles and two points, is there a path between the two\npoints that does not cross more than $k$ different obstacles? This is a\nfundamental problem that has undergone a tremendous amount of work. It is known\nto be NP-hard, even when the obstacles are very simple geometric shapes (e.g.,\nunit-length line segments). The problem can be generalized into the following\ngraph problem: Given a planar graph $G$ whose vertices are colored by color\nsets, two designated vertices $s, t \\in V(G)$, and $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$, is there\nan $s$-$t$ path in $G$ that uses at most $k$ colors? If each obstacle is\nconnected, the resulting graph satisfies the color-connectivity property,\nnamely that each color induces a connected subgraph.\n  We study the complexity and design algorithms for the above graph problem\nwith an eye on its geometric applications. We prove that without the\ncolor-connectivity property, the problem is W[SAT]-hard parameterized by $k$. A\ncorollary of this result is that, unless W[2] $=$ FPT, the problem cannot be\napproximated in FPT time to within a factor that is a function of $k$. By\ndescribing a generic plane embedding of the graph instances, we show that our\nhardness results translate to the geometric instances of the problem.\n  We then focus on graphs satisfying the color-connectivity property.

We employ these results to design an FPT\nalgorithm for the problem parameterized by both $k$ and the treewidth of the\ngraph, and extend this result to obtain an FPT algorithm for the\nparameterization by both $k$ and the length of the path. The latter result\ndirectly implies previous FPT results for various obstacle shapes, such as unit\ndisks and fat regions. \n\n"}

In this paper, we demonstrate a duality\nbetween general classes of clustering and sketching problems. We present a\ngeneral method for efficiently transforming a solution for a clustering problem\nto a solution for a sketching problem, and vice versa, with approximately equal\ncost.

There, one often\ncollects data from a variety of sources, with asynchronous sampling, and\nmissing data. In this setting, one can predict abnormal behavior using low-rank\ntechniques. In particular, we assume that normal observations come from a\nlow-rank subspace, prior to being corrupted by a uniformly distributed noise.\nCorrespondingly, we aim to recover a representation of the subspace, and\nperform event detection by running point-to-subspace distance query for\nincoming data. In particular, we use a variant of low-rank factorisation, which\nconsiders interval uncertainty sets around \"known entries\", on a suitable\nflattening of the input data to obtain a low-rank model. On-line, we compute\nthe distance of incoming data to the low-rank normal subspace and update the\nsubspace to keep it consistent with the seasonal changes present. For the\ndistance computation, we suggest to consider subsampling.

The\ntree-like shapes of neurons cannot mathematically be adequately described as\npoints in a vector space. There is therefore a need for new approaches.

Here we introduce methods from Discrete Morse Theory to\nextract tree-skeletons of individual neurons from volumetric brain image data,\nor to summarize collections of neurons labelled by localized anterograde tracer\ninjections. Since individual neurons are topologically trees, it is sensible to\nsummarize the collection of neurons labelled by a localized anterograde tracer\ninjection using a consensus tree-shape. The algorithmic procedure includes an\ninitial pre-processing step to extract a density field from the raw volumetric\nimage data, followed by initial skeleton extraction from the density field\nusing a discrete version of a 1-(un)stable manifold of the density field.\nHeuristically, if the density field is regarded as a mountainous landscape,\nthen the 1-(un)stable manifold follows the \"mountain ridges\" connecting the\nmaxima of the density field.

A distance-two $r$-coloring\nof a graph $G$ is an assignment of $r$ colors to the vertices of $G$ so that\nany two vertices at distance at most two have different colors. Note that a\ncubic graph needs at least four colors. The distance-two four-coloring problem\nfor cubic planar graphs is known to be NP-complete. We claim the problem\nremains NP-complete for tri-connected bipartite cubic planar graphs, which we\ncall type-one Barnette graphs, since they are the first class identified by\nBarnette.

In the tasting sessions,\nthe assessors follow their own criteria to place samples on a tablecloth,\naccording to the similarity between samples. In order to analyse the data\ncollected, first a geometric clustering is performed to each tablecloth,\nextracting connections between the samples. Then, these connections are used to\nconstruct a global similarity matrix. Finally, a graph drawing algorithm is\nused to obtain a 2D consensus graphic, which reflects the global opinion of the\npanel by (1) positioning closer those samples that have been globally perceived\nas similar and (2) showing the strength of the connections between samples. The\nproposal is validated by performing four tasting sessions, with three types of\npanels tasting different wines, and by developing a new software to implement\nthe proposed techniques. The results obtained show that the graphics provide\nsimilar positionings of the samples as the consensus maps obtained by multiple\nfactor analysis (MFA), further providing extra information about connections\nbetween samples, not present in any previous method. The main conclusion is\nthat the use of geometric techniques provides information complementary to MFA,\nand of a different type.

Subsequently, random matrix theory (RMT)\ndeveloped, initially within physics, and more recently widely in mathematics.\nWhile some of the central objects of study in RMT are identical to those of\nmultivariate statistics, statistical theory was slow to exploit the connection.\nHowever, with vast data collection ever more common, data sets now often have\nas many or more variables than the number of individuals observed. In such\ncontexts, the techniques and results of RMT have much to offer multivariate\nstatistics. The paper reviews some of the progress to date. \n\n"}

Mertens\nand H. Bauke. We establish our conjecture for a wide class of Gaussian and\nnon-Gaussian Hamiltonians, which include the $p$-spin models, the\nSherrington-Kirkpatrick model and the number partitioning problem. We prove\nthat our universality result is optimal for the last two models by showing when\nthis universality breaks down. \n\n"}

Connections are made with the\nLagrange-Sylvester interpolation approach to Markov chains. \n\n"}

{"id": "q-bio/0610057", "contents": "Title: Second look at the spread of epidemics on networks Abstract: In an important paper, M.E.J. Newman claimed that a general network-based\nstochastic Susceptible-Infectious-Removed (SIR) epidemic model is isomorphic to\na bond percolation model, where the bonds are the edges of the contact network\nand the bond occupation probability is equal to the marginal probability of\ntransmission from an infected node to a susceptible neighbor. In this paper, we\nshow that this isomorphism is incorrect and define a semi-directed random\nnetwork we call the epidemic percolation network that is exactly isomorphic to\nthe SIR epidemic model in any finite population. In the limit of a large\npopulation, (i) the distribution of (self-limited) outbreak sizes is identical\nto the size distribution of (small) out-components, (ii) the epidemic threshold\ncorresponds to the phase transition where a giant strongly-connected component\nappears, (iii) the probability of a large epidemic is equal to the probability\nthat an initial infection occurs in the giant in-component, and (iv) the\nrelative final size of an epidemic is equal to the proportion of the network\ncontained in the giant out-component. For the SIR model considered by Newman,\nwe show that the epidemic percolation network predicts the same mean outbreak\nsize below the epidemic threshold, the same epidemic threshold, and the same\nfinal size of an epidemic as the bond percolation model. However, the bond\npercolation model fails to predict the correct outbreak size distribution and\nprobability of an epidemic when there is a nondegenerate infectious period\ndistribution. We confirm our findings by comparing predictions from percolation\nnetworks and bond percolation models to the results of simulations. In an\nappendix, we show that an isomorphism to an epidemic percolation network can be\ndefined for any time-homogeneous stochastic SIR model. \n\n"}
