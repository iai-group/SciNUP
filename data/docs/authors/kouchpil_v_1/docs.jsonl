Using this model, we have shown previously that the nucleon form\nfactors and the dominant form factor for the gamma N -> Delta transition (the\nmagnetic dipole (M1) form factor) can be well described by nucleon and Delta\nwave functions with S-state components only. In this paper we show that\nnon-vanishing results for the small electric (E2) and Coulomb (C2) quadrupole\nform factors can be obtained if D-state components are added to the Delta\nvalence quark wave function. We present a covariant definition of these\ncomponents and compute their contributions to the form factors. We find that\nthese components cannot, by themselves, describe the data. Explicit pion cloud\ncontributions must also be added and these contributions dominate both the E2\nand the C2 form factors.

The well-established evolution of the global even-odd\neffect with the fissioning system is found to be only a partial aspect of the\neven-odd structure.

We can imagine a unitary transformation which groups four non\nidentical nucleons (i.e. with different spin and isospin) close in coordinate\nspace. Those nucleons, being non identical, do not obey the Pauli principle,\nthus their relative momenta are negligibly small (just to fulfill the\nHeisenberg principle). Such a cluster can be identified with an $\\alpha$ boson.\nBut in dense nuclear matter, those $\\alpha$ particles still obey the Pauli\nprinciple since are constituted of Fermions. The ground state energy of nuclear\nmatter $\\alpha$ clusters is the same as for nucleons, thus it is degenerate. We\ncould think of $\\alpha$ particles as vortices which can now braid, for instance\nmaking $^8Be$ which leave the ground state energy unchanged. Further braiding\nto heavier clusters ($^{12}C$, $^{16}O$..) could give a different\nrepresentation of the ground state at no energy cost. In contrast d-like\nclusters (i.e. N=Z odd-odd nuclei, where N and Z are the neutron and proton\nnumber respectively) cannot describe the ground state of nuclear matter and can\nbe formed at high excitation energies (or temperatures) only. We show that\neven-even, N=Z, clusters could be classified as non-Abelian states of matter.\nAs a consequence an $\\alpha$ condensate in nuclear matter might be hindered by\nthe Fermi motion, while it could be possible a condensate of $^8Be$ or heavier\nclusters. \n\n"}

To model the real-time non-perturbative effects in the\npropagation of a high energy jet through the strongly coupled QCD matter, we\nadopt an effective dimensionally reduced description in terms of the $(1+1)$\nquasi-Abelian Schwinger theory. This theory is exactly soluble at any value of\nthe coupling and shares with QCD the properties of dynamical generation of\n\"mesons\" with a finite mass and the screening of \"quark\" charge that are\ncrucial for describing the transition of the jet into hadrons. We find that\nthis approach describes quite well the vacuum jet fragmentation in $e^+e^-$\nannihilation at $z\\geq0.2$ at jet energies in the range of the LHC heavy ion\nmeasurements ($z$ is the ratio of hadron and jet momenta). In QCD medium, we\nfind that the JFS is reproduced if the mean free path $\\lambda$ of the jet is\nshort, $\\lambda \\leq 0.3$ fm, which is in accord with the small shear viscosity\ninferred from the measurements of the collective flow. The JFS holds since at\nshort mean free path the quantum interference (analogous to the\nLandau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal effect in QED) causes the produced mesons to have low\nmomenta $p \\sim m$, where $m \\simeq 0.6$ GeV is the typical meson mass.\nMeanwhile the induced jet energy loss at short mean free path is much larger\nthan naively expected in string models. \n\n"}

Slowed down in terrestrial\nmatter OHe atoms cause negligible effects of nuclear recoil in underground\ndetectors, but can experience radiative capture by nuclei. Local concentration\nof OHe in the matter of detectors is rapidly adjusted to the incoming flux of\ncosmic OHe and possess annual modulation due to Earth's orbital motion around\nthe Sun. The potential of OHe-nucleus interaction is determined by polarization\nof OHe by the Coulomb and nuclear force of the approaching nucleus.

Charm and bottom quarks have been predicted to\ninteract with the medium differently than the light quarks; a study of heavy\nquark interactions with the medium provides an important test of theoretical\nmodels of the quark-gluon plasma.\n  The spectrum of non-photonic electrons (and positrons) is dominated by\nelectrons from the semileptonic decays of D and B mesons. Therefore,\nnon-photonic electrons serve as proxies for heavy quarks.

The geometry dependence\nof the correlation function leads to stronger azimuthal near- and away-side\ncorrelations in the tip-on-tip U+U collisions than in the side-on-side U+U\ncollisions, an exactly opposite behavior from the correlations generated by the\nelliptic flow of the quark-gluon plasma: a study of azimuthal correlations in\nthe U+U collisions may thus help to disentangle the two sources of\ncorrelations.\n  We demonstrate that the cross section for two-gluon production in heavy-light\nion collisions contains a power-law infrared (IR) divergence even for fixed\nproduced gluon momenta: while saturation effects in the target regulate some of\nthe power-law IR-divergent terms in the lowest-order expression for the\ntwo-gluon correlator, other power-law IR-divergent terms remain, possibly due\nto absence of saturation effects in the dilute projectile.

The study of the modification of the\ntransverse momentum differential yields of charm particles in Pb-Pb collisions\nwith respect to pp collisions, quantified by the nuclear modification factor\n($R_{\\rm AA}$), can unravel details of the energy loss mechanism, such as its\ndependence on the quark mass and on the path length the parton travels through\nthe medium.

These low $p_{T}$ photons have a large\nazimuthal anisotropy, $v_{2}$. Theoretical models, including hydrodynamic\nmodels, struggle to quantitatively reproduce the large low $p_{T}$ direct\nphoton excess and $v_{2}$ in a self-consistent manner.

This production mechanism will generate photons that\nfollow constituent quark number, $n_{q}$, scaling of $v_{2}$ with an $n_{q}$\nvalue of two for direct photons. $\\chi^{2}$ comparisons of the published PHENIX\ndirect photon and identified particle $v_{2}$ measurements finds that\n$n_{q}$-scaling applied to the direct photon $v_{2}$ data prefers the value\n$n_{q}=1.8$ and agrees with $n_{q}=2$ within errors in most cases.

Purpose: We want\nto investigate the influence of SRCs on the one-nucleon (1N) and two-nucleon\n(2N) knockout channel for muon-neutrino induced processes on a $^{12}$C target\nat energies relevant for contemporary measurements. Method: The model adopted\nin this work, corrects the impulse approximation for SRCs by shifting the com-\nplexity induced by the SRCs from the wave functions to the operators. Due to\nthe local character of the SRCs, it is argued that the expansion of these\noperators can be truncated at a low order.

The astrophysical impact of these two rates has been\ninvestigated through one-zone postprocessing type I x-ray burst calculations.\nWe find that our new upper limit for the $^{30}$S($\\alpha$,p)$^{33}$Cl rate\nsignificantly affects the predicted nuclear energy generation rate during the\nburst. \n\n"}

It is based on the symmetries of quantum chromodynamics and\nincludes long-range pion physics explicitly, while shorter-range physics is\nexpanded in a general operator basis. The number of low-energy couplings at a\nparticular order in the expansion can be reduced by exploiting the fact that\nnucleons are fermions and therefore obey the Pauli exclusion principle. The\nantisymmetry permits the selection of a subset of the allowed contact operators\nat a given order. When local regulators are used for these short-range\ninteractions, however, this \"Fierz rearrangement freedom\" is violated. In this\npaper, we investigate the impact of this violation at leading order (LO) in the\nchiral expansion. We construct LO and next-to-leading order (NLO) potentials\nfor all possible LO-operator pairs and study their reproduction of phase\nshifts, the ${}^4$He ground-state energy, and the neutron-matter energy at\ndifferent densities. We demonstrate that the Fierz rearrangement freedom is\npartially restored at NLO where subleading contact interactions enter.

Since the adopted model provides the excitation energy distribution\nof these primordial fragments, it allows one to calculate the temperatures of\ndifferent isotope families and infer on the sensitivity to their isospin\ncomposition. It is found that, due to the functional form of the nuclear\ndensity of states and the excitation energy distribution of the fragments,\nproton rich isotopes are hotter than neutron rich ones.

In pp collisions,\nthe measurement of heavy-flavour hadron production provides a reference for\nheavy-ion studies, and allows also testing perturbative QCD calculations in a\nwide range of collision energies. Similar studies in p--Pb collisions help in\ndisentangling cold nuclear matter effects from modifications induced by the\npresence of a QGP medium, and are also useful to investigate the possible\nexistence of collective phenomena also in this system.

Abstract: A future core-collapse supernova in our Galaxy will be detected by several\nneutrino detectors around the world. The neutrinos escape from the supernova\ncore over several seconds from the time of collapse, unlike the electromagnetic\nradiation, emitted from the envelope, which is delayed by a time of order\nhours. In addition, the electromagnetic radiation can be obscured by dust in\nthe intervening interstellar space. The question therefore arises whether a\nsupernova can be located by its neutrinos alone. The early warning of a\nsupernova and its location might allow greatly improved astronomical\nobservations. The theme of the present work is a careful and realistic\nassessment of this question, taking into account the statistical significance\nof the various neutrino signals. Not surprisingly, neutrino-electron forward\nscattering leads to a good determination of the supernova direction, even in\nthe presence of the large and nearly isotropic background from other reactions.\nEven with the most pessimistic background assumptions, SuperKamiokande (SK) and\nthe Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) can restrict the supernova direction to\nbe within circles of radius $5^\\circ$ and $20^\\circ$, respectively. Other\nreactions with more events but weaker angular dependence are much less useful\nfor locating the supernova. Finally, there is the oft-discussed possibility of\ntriangulation, i.e., determination of the supernova direction based on an\narrival time delay between different detectors. Given the expected statistics\nwe show that, contrary to previous estimates, this technique does not allow a\ngood determination of the supernova direction. \n\n"}

Our treatment allows us to investigate the possible simultaneous\nformation of condensates in the conventional quark--anti-quark channel\n(breaking chiral symmetry) and in a quark--quark channel leading to color\nsuperconductivity: the spontaneous breaking of color symmetry via the formation\nof quark Cooper pairs. At low temperatures, chiral symmetry restoration occurs\nvia a first order transition between a phase with low (or zero) baryon density\nand a high density color superconducting phase. We find color superconductivity\nin the high density phase for temperatures less than of order tens to 100 MeV,\nand find coexisting $<qq>$ and $<\\bar q q>$ condensates in this phase in the\npresence of a current quark mass.

By studying these fluctuations as a\nfunction of varying control parameters, it is possible to learn much about the\nphase diagram of QCD.

Those event-by-event signatures which are characteristic of freeze-out\nin the vicinity of the critical point will exhibit nonmonotonic dependence on\ncontrol parameters. We focus on observables constructed from the multiplicity\nand transverse momenta of charged pions. We first consider how the\nevent-by-event fluctuations of such observables are affected by Bose-Einstein\ncorrelations, by resonances which decay after freeze-out and by fluctuations in\nthe transverse flow velocity. We compare our thermodynamic predictions for such\nnoncritical event-by-event fluctuations with NA49 data, finding broad\nagreement.

We present results from the STAR detector on high $p_T$ angular\ncorrelations in Au+Au and p+p collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV/c. These\ntwo-particle angular correlation measurements verify the presence of a partonic\nhard scattering and fragmentation component at high $p_T$ in both central and\nperipheral Au+Au collisions. When triggering on a leading hadron with $p_T>$4\nGeV, we observe a quantitative agreement between the jet cone properties in p+p\nand all centralities of Au+Au collisions. This quantitative agreement indicates\nthat nearly all hadrons with $p_T>$4 GeV/c come from jet fragmentation and that\njet fragmentation properties are not substantially modified in Au+Au\ncollisions. STAR has also measured the strength of back-to-back high $p_T$\ncharged hadron correlations, and observes a small suppression of the\nback-to-back correlation strength in peripheral collisions, and a nearly\ncomplete disappearance of back-to-back correlations in central Au+Au events.\nThese phenomena, toghether with the observed strong suppression of inclusive\nyields and large value of elliptic flow at high $p_T$, are consistent with a\nmodel where high $p_T$ hadrons come from partons created near the surface of\nthe collision region, and where partons that originate or propagate towards the\ncenter of the collision region are substantially slowed or completely absorbed. \n\n"}

If matter is close to the softest point of\nthe equation of state, this ellipsoid expands predominantly orthogonal to the\ndirection given by Theta.

{"id": "nucl-th/9908013", "contents": "Title: Looking For Disoriented Chiral Condensates From Pion Distributions Abstract: We suggest two methods for the detection of the formation of disoriented\nchiral condensates in heavy ion collisions. We show that the variance in the\nnumber of charged pions (in a suitable range of momentum space) provides a\nsignature for the observation of a disoriented chiral condensate. The signal\nshould be observable even if multiple domains of D$\\chi$C form provided the\naverage number of pions per domain is significantly larger than unity. The\nvariance of the number charged pions alone provides a signal which can be used\neven if the number of neutral pions cannot be measured in a given detector. On\nthe other hand, the probability distribution in $R$, the proportion of neutral\npions to all pions emitted in heavy ion collisions in certain kinematic\nregions, has been suggested as a signal of a disoriented chiral condensate.\nHere we note that the signature can be greatly enhanced by making suitable cuts\nin the data. In particular, we consider reducing the data set such that the $k$\npions with lowest $p_T$ are all neutral. We find that, given such cuts, $<R>$\ncan be substantially different from 1/3. For example, for a single D$\\chi$C\ndomain without contamination due to incoherently emitted pions, $<R>$ is 3/5\ngiven the pion with lowest $p_T$ is neutral, and 5/7 given the two pions with\nlowest $p_T$ are both neutral, {\\it etc.}. The effects of multi-domain D$\\chi$C\nformation and noise due to incoherent pion emission can be systematically\nincorporated. Potential applications to experiments and their limitations are\nbriefly discussed. \n\n"}

The effect\nshows up in the reaction plane as enhanced emission which is orthogonal to the\ndirected flow. Thus, it is not shadowed by the deflected projectile and target.\nAs both of these flow components are in the reaction plane these form an\nenhanced 'elliptic flow' pattern. Recent experimental data at 11 AGeV and above\nshow the same softening, hinting at QGP formation. \n\n"}

Abstract: The directed flow of protons is studied in the quark-gluon string model as a\nfunction of the impact parameter for S+S and Pb+Pb reactions at 160 AGeV/c. A\nsignificant reduction of the directed flow in midrapidity range, which can lead\nto the development of the antiflow, is found due to the absorption of early\nemitted particles by massive spectators (shadowing effect). This effect can\nmimic the formation of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). However, in the absorption\nscenario the antiflow is stronger for the system of light colliding nuclei than\nfor the heavy ones, while in the case of the plasma creation the effect should\nbe opposite. \n\n"}

In addition, the Delta J\n= 1 staggering effect (i.e. the relative displacement of the levels with even\nangular momentum J with respect to the levels of the same band with odd J) is\nstudied in molecular bands free from Delta J = 2 staggering (i.e. free from\ninterband interactions/bandcrossings). Bands of YD offer evidence for the\nabsence of any Delta J = 1 staggering effect due to the disparity of nuclear\nmasses, while bands of sextet electronic states of CrD demonstrate that Delta J\n= 1 staggering is a sensitive probe of deviations from rotational behaviour,\ndue in this particular case to the spin-rotation and spin-spin interactions. \n\n"}

Attaining the target sensitivity requires maintaining an electric field\nof several tens of kilovolts per centimeter across the experimental cell, which\nis nominally 7.5 cm wide and will contain about 4 liters of superfluid. The\nelectrical properties of liquid helium are expected to be sufficient to meet\nthe design goals, but little is known about these properties for volumes and\nelectrode spacings appropriate to the EDM experiment. Furthermore, direct\napplication of the necessary voltages from an external source to the\nexperimental test cell is impractical. An apparatus to amplify voltages in the\nliquid helium environment and to test the electrical properties of the liquid\nfor large volumes and electrode spacings has been constructed. The device\nconsists of a large-area parallel plate capacitor immersed in a 200 liter\nliquid helium dewar. Preliminary results show the breakdown strength of normal\nstate liquid helium is at least 90 kV/cm at these volumes, at the helium vapor\npressure corresponding to 4.38 K. These fields hold for more than 11 hours with\nleakage currents less than 170 pA (about 20% of the maximum tolerable in the\nEDM experiment). The system is also found to be robust against anticipated\nradiation backgrounds. Preliminary results for superfluid show that fields of\nat least 30 kV/cm can be sustained at the volumes required for the EDM\nexperiment, about 60% of the design goal. These results are likely limited by\nthe low pressure that must be maintained above the superfluid bath. \n\n"}
