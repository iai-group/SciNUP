Validation is crucial as industries and governments depend\nincreasingly on predictions by computer models to justify their decisions. In\nthis article, we survey the model validation literature and propose to\nformulate validation as an iterative construction process that mimics the\nprocess occurring implicitly in the minds of scientists. We thus offer a formal\nrepresentation of the progressive build-up of trust in the model, and thereby\nreplace incapacitating claims on the impossibility of validating a given model\nby an adaptive process of constructive approximation. This approach is better\nadapted to the fuzzy, coarse-grained nature of validation. Our procedure\nfactors in the degree of redundancy versus novelty of the experiments used for\nvalidation as well as the degree to which the model predicts the observations.\nWe illustrate the new methodology first with the maturation of Quantum\nMechanics as the arguably best established physics theory and then with several\nconcrete examples drawn from some of our primary scientific interests: a\ncellular automaton model for earthquakes, an anomalous diffusion model for\nsolar radiation transport in the cloudy atmosphere, and a computational fluid\ndynamics code for the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability.

We study the detectability with the Fermi-LAT of\nthe gamma-ray flux from DM annihilation in Draco, Ursa Minor, Carina, and\nSextans, for which the state-of-art DM density profiles were available. We\nassume the DM is made of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles such as the\nLightest Supersymmetric Particle (LSP) and compute the expected gamma-ray flux\nfor optimistic choices of the unknown underlying particle physics parameters.\nWe then compute the boost factors due to the presence of DM clumps and of a\ncentral supermassive black hole.

Traditional N-body simulations of multiple-planet systems without\ngas disks have successfully reproduced the eccentricity (e) distribution of the\nobserved systems, by assuming that the planetary systems are relatively closely\npacked when the gas disk dissipates, so that they become dynamically unstable\nwithin the stellar lifetime. However, such studies cannot explain the small\nsemi-major axes (a) of extrasolar planetary systems, if planets are formed, as\nthe standard planet formation theory suggests, beyond the ice line.\n  In this paper, we numerically study the evolution of three-planet systems in\ndissipating gas disks, and constrain the initial conditions that reproduce the\nobserved semi-major axis and eccentricity distributions simultaneously. We\nadopt the initial conditions that are motivated by the standard planet\nformation theory, and self-consistently simulate the disk evolution, and planet\nmigration by using a hybrid N-body and 1D gas disk code. We also take account\nof eccentricity damping, and investigate the effect of saturation of corotation\nresonances on the evolution of planetary systems. We find that the semi-major\naxis distribution is largely determined in a gas disk, while the eccentricity\ndistribution is determined after the disk dissipation. We also find that there\nmay be an optimum disk mass which leads to the observed a-e distribution. Our\nsimulations generate a larger fraction of planetary systems trapped in\nmean-motion resonances (MMRs) than the observations, indicating that the disk's\nperturbation to the planetary orbits may be important to explain the observed\nrate of MMRs. We also find much lower occurrence of planets on retrograde\norbits than the current observations of close-in planets suggest. \n\n"}

Of primary\nconcern is the scenario of two rarefied preplanetesimals (RPPs) in circular\nheliocentric orbits. The theoretical results are used to develop models of\nbinary or multiple system formation from RPPs, and explain the observation that\na greater fraction of binaries originated farther from the Sun. At the stage of\nRPPs, small-body satellites can form in two ways: a merger between RPPs can\nhave two centers of contraction, or the formation of satellites from a disc\naround the primary or the secondary. Formation of the disc can be caused by\nthat the angular momentum of the RPP formed by the merger is greater than the\ncritical angular momentum for a solid body. One or several satellites of the\nprimary (moving mainly in low-eccentricity orbits) can be formed from this disc\nat any separation less than the Hill radius. The first scenario can explain a\nsystem such as 2001 QW322 where the two components have similar masses but are\nseparated by a great distance. In general, any values for the eccentricity and\ninclination of the mutual orbit are possible. Among discovered binaries, the\nobserved angular momenta are smaller than the typical angular momenta expected\nfor identical RPPs having the same total mass as the discovered binary and\nencountering each other in circular heliocentric orbits. This suggests that the\npopulation of RPPs underwent some contraction before mergers became common. \n\n"}

Two stars (HD 40136\nand HD 10647) show weak evidence for spectral features; the excess emission in\nthe other systems is featureless. If the emitting material consists of large\n(10 micron) grains as implied by the lack of spectral features, we find that\nthese grains are typically located at or beyond the snow line, ~1-35 AU from\nthe host stars, with an average distance of 14 +/- 6 AU; however smaller grains\ncould be located at significantly greater distances from the host stars.

If the orientation of the deduced BDF represents the\norientation of the local interstellar magnetic field (LISMF), as indicated by\nbest-fitting a model to the data, the UDF deviating from the BDF orientation\nimplies a significant contribution from the streaming perpendicular to the\nLISMF. This perpendicular streaming is probably due to the drift anisotropy,\nbecause the contribution from the perpendicular diffusion is expected to be\nmuch smaller than the drift effect. The large amplitude deduced for the UDF\nindicates a large spatial gradient of the GCR density. We suggest that such a\ndensity gradient can be expected at the heliosphere sitting close to the\nboundary of the Local Interstellar Cloud (LIC), if the LIC is expanding.

The MHD calculations use the stratified shearing-box approach and\ninclude grain settling and the feedback from the changing dust abundance on the\nresistivity of the gas. The two-decade spread in accretion rates among T Tauri\nstars is too large to result solely from variety in the grain size and stellar\nX-ray luminosity, but can be produced by varying these together with the disk\nmagnetic flux. The diversity in the silicate bands can come from the coupling\nof grain settling to the distribution of the magneto-rotational turbulence,\nthrough three effects: (1) Recombination on grains yields a magnetically\ninactive dead zone extending above two scale heights, while turbulence in the\nmagnetically active disk atmosphere overshoots the dead zone boundary by only\nabout one scale height. (2) Grains deep in the dead zone oscillate vertically\nin waves driven by the turbulent layer above, but on average settle at the\nlaminar rates, so the interior of the dead zone is a particle sink and the disk\natmosphere becomes dust-depleted. (3) With sufficient depletion, the dead zone\nis thinner and mixing dredges grains off the midplane. The MHD results also\nshow that the magnetic activity intermittently lifts clouds of dust into the\natmosphere. The photosphere height changes by up to one-third over a few\norbits, while the extinction along lines of sight grazing the disk surface\nvaries by factors of two over times down to 0.1 orbit.

We attempt a\nstatistical analysis of the albedo and redistribution efficiency for 24\ntransiting exoplanets that have at least one published secondary eclipse.

We then use a simple model-independent\ntechnique to estimate a planet's effective temperature from planet/star flux\nratios. We use thermal secondary eclipse measurements -those obtained at\nlambda>0.8 micron- to estimate day-side effective temperatures, T_d, and\nthermal phase variations -when available- to estimate night-side effective\ntemperature. We strongly rule out the \"null hypothesis\" of a single A_B and\nepsilon for all 24 planets.

Using 5,000 long duration\nN-body simulations, we follow the evolution of three planets surrounded by a 50\nEarth mass primordial planetesimal disk. For large planet masses (above that of\nSaturn) the influence of the disk is modest, and we recover the observed\neccentricity distribution of extrasolar planets (observed primarily at smaller\nradii). We explain the observed mass dependence of the eccentricity by invoking\nstrong correlations between planet masses in the same system. For lower mass\nplanets we observe diverse dynamical behavior: strong scattering events, sudden\njumps in eccentricity due to resonance crossings, and re-circularization of\nscattered low-mass planets in the disk.

Particularly, we include the effects of gravitational\ninstabilities (wakes) that importantly enhance the disk's viscosity. We show\nthat common estimates of the disk's spreading time-scales with constant\nviscosity significantly underestimate the rings' lifetime. With a realistic\nviscosity model, an initially narrow ring undergoes two successive evolutionary\nstages: (1) a transient rapid spreading when the disk is self-gravitating, with\nthe formation of a density peak inward and an outer region marginally\ngravitationally stable, and with an emptying time-scale proportional to 1/M_0^2\n(where M_0 is the disk's initial mass) (2) an asymptotic regime where the\nspreading rate continuously slows down as larger parts of the disk become\nnot-self-gravitating due to the decrease of the surface density, until the disk\nbecomes completely not-self-gravitating. At this point its evolution\ndramatically slows down, with an emptying time-scale proportional to 1/M_0,\nwhich significantly increases the disk's lifetime compared to the case with\nconstant viscosity. We show also that the disk's width scales like t^{1/4} with\nthe realistic viscosity model, while it scales like t^{1/2} in the case of\nconstant viscosity, resulting in much larger evolutionary time-scales in our\nmodel. We find however that the present shape of Saturn's rings looks like a\n100 million-years old disk in our simulations.

We improve upon previous calibrations in three ways.\nWe use both a volume-limited and kinematically-matched sample of F and G dwarfs\nfrom the Geneva-Copehnagen Survey (GCS) to infer the mean metallicity of M\ndwarfs in the Solar Neighborhood, we use theoretical models of M dwarf\ninteriors and atmospheres to determine the effect of metallicity on M dwarfs in\nthe V-K_s--M_Ks CMD, and we base our final calibration purely on\nhigh-resolution spectroscopy of FGK primaries with M dwarf companions. As a\nresult, we explain an order of magnitude more of the variance in the\ncalibration sample than previous photometric calibrations. We\nnon-parametrically quantify the significance of the observation that M dwarfs\nthat host exoplanets are preferentially in a region of the V-K_s--M_Ks plane\npopulated by metal-rich M dwarfs.

We find numerical solutions\nfor mass ratios q between 1e-3 and 1, starting at a small angular velocity for\nwhich tidal and rotational deformations are small, and following a sequence of\nincreasing angular velocities. Each series terminates at an appropriate ``Roche\nlimit'', above which no equilibrium solution can be found. Even though the\nRoche limit is crossed before the ``Roche lobe'' is filled, any further\nincrease in the angular velocity will result in mass-loss. For close,\ncomparable-mass binaries, we find that local deviations from ellipsoidal forms\nmay be as large as 10-20%, and departures from Keplerian rotation are\nsignificant. We compute the light curves that arise from our equilibrium\nconfigurations, assuming their distance is >>1 AU (e.g. in the Kuiper Belt). We\nconsider both backscatter (proportional to the projected area) and diffuse\n(Lambert) reflections. Backscatter reflection always yields two minima of equal\ndepths.

Following the collapse from\nthe prestellar phase allows us to model the early embedded phase of disk\nformation and evolution. During this time, the disk is susceptible to\nfragmentation, depending upon the properties of the initial prestellar core.\nGlobally, we find that higher initial core angular momentum and mass content\nfavors more fragmentation, but higher levels of background radiation can\nmoderate the tendency to fragment. A higher rate of mass infall onto the disk\nthan that onto the star is a necessary but not sufficient condition for disk\nfragmentation.

We model the interior of GJ 1214b assuming a two-layer (envelope+rock\ncore) structure where the envelope material is either H/He, pure water, or a\nmixture of H/He and H2O. Within this framework we perform models of the thermal\nevolution and contraction of the planet. We discuss possible compositions that\nare consistent with Mp=6.55 ME, Rp=2.678 RE, an age tau=3-10 Gyr, and the\nirradiation level of the atmosphere. These conditions require that if water\nexists in the interior, it must remain in a fluid state, with important\nconsequences for magnetic field generation. These conditions also require the\natmosphere to have a deep isothermal region extending down to 80-800 bar,\ndepending on composition.

We\nresolve the emission from the protostar radio Source I and BN at several\nepochs. Source I is highly elongated NW-SE, and remarkably stable in flux\ndensity, position angle, and overall morphology over nearly a decade. This\nfavors the extended emission component arising from an ionized disk rather than\na jet. We have measured the proper motions of Source I and BN for the first\ntime at 43 GHz. We confirm that both sources are moving at high speed (12 and\n26 km/s, respectively) approximately in opposite directions, as previously\ninferred from measurements at lower frequencies. We discuss dynamical scenarios\nthat can explain the large motions of both BN and Source I and the presence of\ndisks around both. Our new measurements support the hypothesis that a close\n(~50 AU) dynamical interaction occurred around 500 years ago between Source I\nand BN as proposed by Gomez et al. From the dynamics of encounter we argue that\nSource I today is likely to be a binary with a total mass on the order of 20\nMsun, and that it probably existed as a softer binary before the close\nencounter. This enables preservation of the original accretion disk, though\ntruncated to its present radius of ~50 AU.

This early stage occurs much before the dispersal of most of the\ngas from the protoplanetary disk. Due to their different aerodynamic\nproperties, planetesimals of different sizes and shapes experience different\ndrag forces from the gas during this time. Such differential forces produce a\nwind-shearing (WISH) effect between close by, different size planetesimals. For\nany two planetesimals, a WISH radius can be considered, at which the\ndifferential acceleration due to the wind becomes greater than the mutual\ngravitational pull between the planetesimals. We find that the WISH radius\ncould be much smaller than the Hill radius, i.e. WISH could play a more\nimportant role than tidal perturbations by the star. Here we study the WISH\nradii for planetesimal pairs of different sizes and compare the effects of wind\nand gravitational shearing (drag force vs. gravitational tidal force). We then\ndiscuss the role of WISH for the stability and survival of binary\nplanetesimals. Binaries are sheared apart by the wind if they are wider than\ntheir WISH radius. WISH-stable binaries can inspiral and possibly coalesce due\nto gas drag. Here, we calculate the WISH radius and the gas drag-induced merger\ntimescale, providing stability and survival criteria for gas-embedded binary\nplanetesimals. Our results suggest that even WISH-stable binaries may merge in\ntimes shorter than the lifetime of the gaseous disk. This may constrain\ncurrently observed binary planetesimals to have formed far from the star or at\na late stage after the dispersal of most of the disk gas.

It takes into\naccount both galaxy evolution and the perturbing effects of large scale\nstructure. The key to the algorithm is a maximum likelihood (ML) method for\njointly estimating both the luminosity function (LF) and the overdensity as a\nfunction of redshift. The random catalogue algorithm then works by cloning each\ngalaxy in the original catalogue, with the number of clones determined by the\nML solution. Each of these cloned galaxies is then assigned a random redshift\nuniformly distributed over the accessible survey volume, taking account of the\nsurvey magnitude limit(s) and, optionally, both luminosity and number density\nevolution. The resulting random catalogues, which can be employed in\ntraditional estimates of galaxy clustering, make fuller use of the information\navailable in the original catalogue and hence are superior to simply fitting a\nfunctional form to the observed redshift distribution. They are particularly\nwell suited to studies of the dependence of galaxy clustering on galaxy\nproperties as each galaxy in the random catalogue has the same list of\nattributes as measured for the galaxies in the genuine catalogue.

Laboratory experiments have shown that dust\naggregates of these sizes stick to one another only at unreasonably low\nvelocities. However, in the protoplanetary disk, millimeter-sized particles are\nknown to have been ubiquitous. One can find relics of them in the form of solid\nchondrules as the main constituent of chondrites. Most of these chondrules were\nfound to feature a fine-grained rim, which is hypothesized to have formed from\naccreting dust grains in the solar nebula. To study the influence of these\ndust-coated chondrules on the formation of chondrites and possibly\nplanetesimals, we conducted collision experiments between millimeter-sized,\ndust-coated chondrule analogs at velocities of a few cm/s. For 2 and 3 mm\ndiameter chondrule analogs covered by dusty rims of a volume filling factor of\n0.18 and 0.35-0.58, we found sticking velocities of a few cm/s.

The distance to the source,\nits transient nature, and high internal column density serve to complicate\nseveral means of estimating the mass of the black hole. Utilizing newly-refined\nrelationships between black hole mass, radio luminosity, and X-ray luminosity,\nand de-beaming the source flux, a weak constraint on the black hole mass is\nobtained: log(M/Msun) = 5.5 +/- 1.1 (1 sigma confidence). The confidence\ninterval is determined from the current intrinsic scatter in the relation,\nwhich includes effects from X-ray variability and accretion modes. This mass\nrange is broad, but it includes low values that are consistent with some\nvariability arguments, and it safely excludes high mass values where it becomes\nimpossible for black holes to disrupt stars.

All the previous studies on the core-accretion\nmodel assumed that the envelope has the solar composition uniformly. In fact,\nthe envelope is likely polluted by evaporated materials of icy planetesimals\nbecause icy planetesimals going through the envelope experience mass loss via\nstrong ablation and most of their masses are deposited in the deep envelope.

Widely- and highly-polluted envelopes allow smaller cores to form\nmassive envelopes before disc dissipation.

{"id": "1106.4179", "contents": "Title: Formation of stars and planets: the role of magnetic fields Abstract: Star formation is thought to be triggered by gravitational collapse of the\ndense cores of molecular clouds. Angular momentum conservation during the\ncollapse results in the progressive increase of the centrifugal force, which\neventually halts the inflow of material and leads to the development of a\ncentral mass surrounded by a disc. In the presence of an angular momentum\ntransport mechanism, mass accretion onto the central object proceeds through\nthis disc, and it is believed that this is how stars typically gain most of\ntheir mass. However, the mechanisms responsible for this transport of angular\nmomentum are not well understood. Although the gravitational field of a\ncompanion star or even gravitational instabilities (particularly in massive\ndiscs) may play a role, the most general mechanisms are turbulence viscosity\ndriven by the magnetorotational instability (MRI), and outflows accelerated\ncentrifugally from the surfaces of the disc.

Using linear\nperturbation theory, we analyze the observable properties of the gravitational\nwake due to the object circularly moving in a static homogeneous gaseous\nmedium, in order to derive the Bondi accretion radius $r_B$, the orbital\ndistance $r_p$, and the Mach number of the object. Supersonic motion, producing\na wake of spiral-onion shell structure, exhibits a single-armed Archimedes\nspiral and two-centered circular arcs with respect to the line of sight. The\npitch angle, arm width, and spacing of the spiral pattern are entirely\ndetermined by the orbital distance $r_p$ and Mach number of the object. The\narm-interarm density contrast is proportional to the Bondi accretion radius,\ndecreasing as a function of distance with a power index of -1. The background\ndensity distribution is globally changed from initially uniform to centrally\nconcentrated. The vertical structure of the wake is manifested as circular arcs\nwith the center at the object location. The angular extent of the arcs is\ndetermined by the Mach number of the object motion. Diagnostic probes of\nnonlinear wakes such as a detached bow shock, an absence of the definite inner\narm boundary, the presence of turbulent low density eddies, and elongated\nshapes of arcs are explained in the extension of the linear analysis. The\ndensity enhancement at the center is always $r_B/r_p$ independent of the\nnonlinearity, suggesting that massive objects can substantially modify the\nbackground distribution.

Earth-like habitable-zone (HZ) planets maintain stable surface\nliquid water over geological time. This requires equilibrium between the\ntemperature-dependent rate of greenhouse-gas consumption by weathering,and\ngreenhouse-gas resupply by other processes. Detected small-radius exoplanets,\nand anticipated M-dwarf HZ rocky planets, are expected to be tidally locked. We\ninvestigate two feedbacks that can destabilize climate on tidally-locked\nplanets. (1) If small changes in pressure alter the temperature distribution\nacross a planet's surface such that the weathering rate increases when the\npressure decreases, a positive feedback occurs involving increasing weathering\nrate near the substellar point, decreasing pressure, and increasing substellar\nsurface temperature. (2) When decreases in pressure increase the surface area\nabove the melting point (through reduced advective cooling of the substellar\npoint), and the corresponding increase in volume of liquid causes net\ndissolution of the atmosphere, a further decrease in pressure occurs. We use an\nidealized energy balance model to map out the conditions under which these\ninstabilities may occur. The weathering runaway can shrink the habitable zone,\nand cause geologically rapid 10^3-fold pressure shifts within the HZ. Mars may\nhave undergone a weathering runaway in the past. Substellar dissolution is\nusually a negative feedback or weak positive feedback on changes in pressure.\nBoth instabilities are suppressed if the atmosphere has a high radiative\nefficiency.

With the assumption of Saha equilibrium, the variation in\ntemperature is the main driver of the variations in the electrical\nconductivity, induced current and Ohmic power dissipated. Atmospheres\npossessing temperature inversions tend to dissipate most of the Ohmic power\nsuperficially, at high altitudes, whereas those without temperature inversions\nare capable of greater dissipation deeper down. Scattering in the optical range\nof wavelengths tends to cool the lower atmosphere, thus reducing the degree of\ndissipation at depth. Purely absorbing cloud decks (in the infrared), of a\nfinite extent in height, allow for localized reductions in dissipation and may\nreverse a temperature inversion if they are dense and thick enough, thus\ngreatly enhancing the dissipation at depth. If Ohmic dissipation is the\nmechanism for inflating hot Jupiters, then variations in the atmospheric\nopacity (which may be interpreted as arising from variations in metallicity and\ncloud/haze properties) and magnetic field strength naturally produce a scatter\nin the measured radii at a given strength of irradiation.

Since metal-poor planets are less dense and have larger radii than\nmetal-rich planets of the same mass, one might expect that metal-poor stars\nhost a higher proportion of gas giants with large radii than metal-rich stars.\nHere I present evidence for a negative correlation at the 2.3-sigma level\nbetween eclipse depth and stellar metallicity in the Kepler gas giant\ncandidates. Based on Kendall's tau statistics, the probability that eclipse\ndepth depends on star metallicity is 0.981. The correlation is consistent with\nplanets orbiting low-metallicity stars being, on average, larger in comparison\nwith their host stars than planets orbiting metal-rich stars.

We post-process a global climate model of an Earth-like\nplanet to simulate reflected lightcurves. Significantly, we obtain glint-like\nphase variations even though we do not include specular reflection in our\nmodel. This false positive is the product of two generic properties: 1) for\nmodest obliquities, a planet's poles receive less orbit-averaged stellar flux\nthan its equator, so the poles are more likely to be covered in highly\nreflective snow and ice, and 2) we show that reflected light from a\nmodest-obliquity planet at crescent phases probes higher latitudes than at\ngibbous phases, therefore a planet's apparent albedo will naturally increase at\ncrescent phase. We suggest that this \"latitude-albedo effect\" will operate even\nfor large obliquities: in that case the equator receives less orbit-averaged\nflux than the poles, and the equator is preferentially sampled at crescent\nphase.

In particular, we consider a\ntemperate climate with polar ice caps (like modern Earth), and a snowball state\nwhere the oceans are globally covered in ice. We first quantitatively study the\nperiodic radiative forcing from, and climatic response to, rotation, obliquity,\nand eccentricity. Orbital eccentricity and seasonal changes in albedo cause\nvariations in the global-mean absorbed flux. The responses of the two climates\nto these global seasons indicate that the temperate planet has 3 times the bulk\nheat capacity of the snowball planet due to the presence of liquid water\noceans. The temperate obliquity seasons are weaker than one would expect based\non thermal inertia alone; this is due to cross-equatorial oceanic and\natmospheric energy transport. Thermal inertia and cross-equatorial heat\ntransport have qualitatively different effects on obliquity seasons, insofar as\nheat transport tends to reduce seasonal amplitude without inducing a phase lag.\nFor an Earth-like planet, however, this effect is masked by the mixing of\nsignals from low thermal inertia regions (sea ice and land) with that from high\nthermal inertia regions (oceans), which also produces a damped response with\nsmall phase lag.

A previous investigation\nof the stellar population in the Kepler field has provided an estimate for the\nFPP of less than 5% for most of the candidates. We report here the results of\nour radial velocity observations on a sample of 46 Kepler candidates with a\ntransit depth greater than 0.4%, orbital period less than 25 days and host star\nbrighter than Kepler magnitude 14.7. We used the SOPHIE spectrograph mounted on\nthe 1.93-m telescope at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence to establish the\nnature of the transiting candidates. In this sample, we found five undiluted\neclipsing binaries, two brown dwarfs, six diluted eclipsing binaries, and nine\nnew transiting planets that complement the 11 already published planets.

Socrates et al. (2012) argued that high\neccentricity migration (HEM) mechanisms proposed for situating these close-in\nplanets should produce an observable population of highly eccentric proto-hot\nJupiters that have not yet tidally circularized. HEM should also create\nfailed-hot Jupiters, with periapses just beyond the influence of fast\ncircularization. Using the technique we previously presented for measuring\neccentricities from photometry (the \"photoeccentric effect\"), we are distilling\na collection of eccentric proto- and failed-hot Jupiters from the Kepler\nObjects of Interest (KOI). Here we present the first, KOI-1474.01, which has a\nlong orbital period (69.7340 days) and a large eccentricity e =\n0.81+0.10/-0.07, skirting the proto-hot Jupiter boundary.

We observed a total of\n88 main-sequence stars, subgiants, and giants all highly probable members of\nM67, using four telescopes and instrument combinations. We investigate whether\nexoplanets are present by obtaining radial velocities with precisions as good\nas 10 m/s. To date, we have performed 680 single observations (Dec. 2011) and a\npreliminary analysis of data, spanning a period of up to eight years. Although\nthe sample was pre-selected to avoid the inclusion of binaries, we identify 11\npreviously unknown binary candidates. Eleven stars clearly displayed larger RV\nvariability and these are candidates to host long-term substellar companions.\nThe average RV is also independent of the stellar magnitude and evolutionary\nstatus, confirming that the difference in gravitational redshift between giants\nand dwarfs is almost cancelled by the atmospheric motions. We use the subsample\nof solar-type stars to derive a precise true RV for this cluster. We finally\ncreate a catalog of binaries and use it to clean the color magnitude diagram\n(CMD).

However, the resonant angles appear to librate\nat the end of the migration process, which is often believed to be an evidence\nthat the systems remain in resonance.\n  Here we provide an analytical model for the dissipation in resonant planetary\nsystems valid for low eccentricities. We confirm that dissipation accounts for\nan excess of pairs that lie just aside from the nominal periods ratios, as\nobserved by the Kepler mission. In addition, by a global analysis of the phase\nspace of the problem, we demonstrate that these final pairs are non-resonant.\nIndeed, the separatrices that exist in the resonant systems disappear with the\ndissipation, and remains only a circulation of the orbits around a single\nelliptical fixed point.

Ohmic heating influences\nthe contraction of gas giants in two ways: by direct heating within the\nconvection zone, and by heating outside the convection zone which increases the\neffective insulation of the interior.

Though secular\nperturbations from the binary can align the disk, in both cases the alignment\ntime at the distances at which the disk is resolved is greater than the stellar\nage, so we conclude that the coplanarity was primordial. Neither disk can be\nmodelled as a narrow ring, requiring extended radial distributions. To satisfy\nboth the Herschel and mid-IR images of the alpha CrB disk, we construct a model\nthat extends from 1-300AU, whose radial profile is broadly consistent with a\npicture where planetesimal collisions are excited by secular perturbations from\nthe binary. However, this model is also consistent with stirring by other\nmechanisms, such as the formation of Pluto-sized objects. The beta Tri disk\nmodel extends from 50-400AU. A model with depleted (rather than empty) inner\nregions also reproduces the observations and is consistent with binary and\nother stirring mechanisms.

It is not clear however how this\npicture changes in turbulent disc models. The aim of this study is to examine\nthe impact of turbulence on the torque experienced by a low-mass planet\nembedded in a non-isothermal protoplanetary disc. We particularly focus on the\nrole of turbulence on the corotation torque whose amplitude depends on the\nefficiency of diffusion processes in the planet's horseshoe region. We\nperformed 2D numerical simulations using a grid-based hydrodynamical code in\nwhich turbulence is modelled as stochastic forcing. In order to provide\nestimations for the viscous and thermal diffusion coefficients as a function of\nthe amplitude of turbulence, we first set up non-isothermal disc models for\ndifferent values of the amplitude of the turbulent forcing.

Using computer simulations, Tiscareno and Malhotra have\npredicted the existence of a small but significant population of minor bodies\nmoving in a 1:1 mean motion resonance with Pluto. Here we show using N-body\ncalculations that the Plutino 15810 (1994 JR1) is currently an accidental\nquasi-satellite of Pluto and it will remain as such for nearly 350,000 yr. By\naccidental we mean that the quasi-satellite phase is triggered (or terminated)\nnot by a direct gravitational influence in the form of a discrete close\nencounter but as a result of a resonance. The relative mean longitude of the\nPlutino circulates with a superimposed libration resulting from the oscillation\nof the orbital period induced by the 2:3 mean motion resonance with Neptune.\nThese quasi-satellite episodes are recurrent with a periodicity of nearly 2\nMyr. This makes 15810 the first minor body moving in a 1:1 mean motion\nresonance with Pluto. It also makes Pluto the second dwarf planet, besides\nCeres, to host a quasi-satellite. Our finding confirms that the quasi-satellite\nresonant phase is not restricted to small bodies orbiting major planets but is\npossible for dwarf planets/asteroids too. Moreover, 15810 could be considered\nas a possible secondary target for NASA's Pluto-Kuiper Belt Mission New\nHorizons after the main Pluto flyby in 2015. \n\n"}

Abstract: We perform a detailed analysis of the latest HARPS and Keck radial velocity\ndata for the planet-hosting red dwarf GJ581, which attracted a lot of attention\nin recent time. We show that these data contain important correlated noise\ncomponent (\"red noise\") with the correlation timescale of the order of 10 days.\nThis red noise imposes a lot of misleading effects while we work in the\ntraditional white-noise model. To eliminate these misleading effects, we\npropose a maximum-likelihood algorithm equipped by an extended model of the\nnoise structure. We treat the red noise as a Gaussian random process with\nexponentially decaying correlation function.\n  Using this method we prove that: (i) planets b and c do exist in this system,\nsince they can be independently detected in the HARPS and Keck data, and\nregardless of the assumed noise models; (ii) planet e can also be confirmed\nindependently by the both datasets, although to reveal it in the Keck data it\nis mandatory to take the red noise into account; (iii) the recently announced\nputative planets f and g are likely just illusions of the red noise; (iv) the\nreality of the planet candidate GJ581 d is questionable, because it cannot be\ndetected from the Keck data, and its statistical significance in the HARPS data\n(as well as in the combined dataset) drops to a marginal level of $\\sim\n2\\sigma$, when the red noise is taken into account.\n  Therefore, the current data for GJ581 really support existence of no more\nthan four (or maybe even only three) orbiting exoplanets.

Our disk model has a cavity\n65 AU in radius, which is heavily depleted of sub-micron-sized dust grains, and\na small residual inner disk which produces a weak but still optically thick NIR\nexcess in the SED. To explain the contrast of the cavity edge in the Subaru\nimage, a factor of ~1000 depletion for the sub-micron-sized dust inside the\ncavity is required.

If the initial inclination of the orbit is larger than some critical\nvalue, the gravitational force exerted by the disc on the planet leads to a\nKozai cycle in which the eccentricity of the orbit is pumped up to large values\nand oscillates with time in antiphase with the inclination. On the other hand,\nboth the inclination and the eccentricity are damped by the frictional force\nthat the planet is subject to when it crosses the disc. We show that, by\nmaintaining either the inclination or the eccentricity at large values, the\nKozai effect provides a way of delaying alignment with the disc and\ncircularization of the orbit. We find the critical value to be\ncharacteristically as small as about 20 degrees.

The\ncombination of the very low mass function and such a short orbital period is\nunique.

Taking a distance to the cloud of 415 pc rather than 259 pc, the\ndistribution of ages is shifted to lower values, in the 1-3 Myr range, with a\ntail up to 10 Myr. The mass distribution spans 0.2-1.2 Msun, with median mass\nof 0.7 Msun. The distribution of fractional disk luminosities in Serpens\nresembles that of the young Taurus Molecular Cloud, with most disks consistent\nwith optically thick, passively irradiated disks in a variety of disk\ngeometries (Ldisk/Lstar ~ 0.1). In contrast, the distributions for the older\nUpper Scorpius and Eta Chamaeleontis clusters are dominated by optically thin\nlower luminosity disks (Ldisk/Lstar ~ 0.02). This evolution in fractional disk\nluminosities is concurrent with that of disk fractions. The actively accreting\nand non-accreting stars (based on Ha data) in Serpens show very similar\ndistributions in fractional disk luminosities, differing only in the brighter\ntail dominated by strongly accreting stars. In contrast with a sample of Herbig\nAe/Be stars, the T Tauri stars in Serpens do not have a clear separation in\nfractional disk luminosities for different disk geometries: both flared and\nflat disks present wider, overlapping distributions. This result is consistent\nwith previous suggestions of a faster evolution for disks around Herbig Ae/Be\nstars. Furthermore, the results for the mineralogy of the dust in the disk\nsurface do not show any correlation to either stellar and disk characteristics\nor mean cluster age in the 1-10 Myr range probed here. A possible explanation\nfor the lack of correlation is that the processes affecting the dust within\ndisks have short timescales, happening repeatedly, making it difficult to\ndistinguish long lasting evolutionary effects.

We found that the tidal\nforces supply significant accelerations and result in anisotropic winds. An\nimportant effect of the tidal forces is that it severely depresses the outflow\nof particles near the polar regions. As a consequence, most particles escape\nthe surface of the planet from the regions of low-latitude. Comparing the tidal\nand non-tidal locking cases, we found that their optical depths are very\ndifferent so that the flows also emerge with a different pattern. In the case\nof the non-tidal locking, the radial velocities at the base of the wind are\nhigher than the meridional velocities. However, in the case of tidal locking,\nthe meridional velocities dominate the flow at the base of the wind, and they\ncan transfer effectively mass and energy from the day sides to the night sides.\nFurther, we also found that the differences of the winds show middle extent at\nlarge radii. It expresses that the structure of the wind at the base can be\nchanged by the two-dimensional radiative transfer due to large optical depths,\nbut the extent is reduced with an increase in radius. Because the escape is\ndepressed in the polar regions, the mass loss rate predicted by the non-tidal\nlocking model, in the order of magnitude of $10^{10}$ g s$^{-1}$, is a factor\nof 2 lower than that predicted by one-dimensional hydrodynamic model. The\nresults of tidal locking show that the mass loss rate is decreased a order of\nmagnitude, only 4.3$\\times$ $10^{9}$ g s$^{-1}$, due to large optical depths on\nthe night side.

The companion Kepler-76b was\nidentified by the BEER algorithm, which detected the BEaming (sometimes called\nDoppler boosting) effect together with the Ellipsoidal and Reflection/emission\nmodulations (BEER), at an orbital period of 1.54 days, suggesting a planetary\ncompanion orbiting the 13.3 mag F star. Further investigation revealed that\nthis star appeared in the Kepler eclipsing binary catalog with estimated\nprimary and secondary eclipse depths of 5e-3 and 1e-4 respectively.\nSpectroscopic radial-velocity follow-up observations with TRES and SOPHIE\nconfirmed Kepler-76b as a transiting 2.0+/-0.26 Mjup hot Jupiter. The mass of a\ntransiting planet can be estimated from either the beaming or the ellipsoidal\namplitude. The ellipsoidal-based mass estimate of Kepler-76b is consistent with\nthe spectroscopically measured mass while the beaming-based estimate is\nsignificantly inflated. We explain this apparent discrepancy as evidence for\nthe superrotation phenomenon, which involves eastward displacement of the\nhottest atmospheric spot of a tidally-locked planet by an equatorial\nsuper-rotating jet stream. This phenomenon was previously observed only for HD\n189733b in the infrared. We show that a phase shift of 10.3+/-2.0 degrees of\nthe planet reflection/emission modulation, due to superrotation, explains the\napparently inflated beaming modulation, resolving the ellipsoidal/beaming\namplitude discrepancy. Kepler-76b is one of very few confirmed planets in the\nKepler light curves that show BEER modulations and the first to show\nsuperrotation evidence in the Kepler band.

These differences can best be explained\nif the onset of high eccentricity planet migration is also a time when planet\nare sent into merge with the star. Planet migration into the star is likely a\ncomplementary explanation to the view that systems with higher initial iron\nabundance form more planets, and that more crowded planets are more likely to\nscatter into eccentric orbits. Planets of iron-rich single stars have\neccentricity distributions that are higher than planets of iron-poor single\nstars (where \"rich\" and \"poor\" are stars whose [Fe/H] is above and below solar,\nrespectively).

Abstract: Planetary migration is one of the most serious problems to systematically\nunderstand the observations of exoplanets. We clarify that the theoretically\npredicted type II migration is too fast, as well as type I migration, by\ndeveloping detailed analytical arguments in which the timescale of type II\nmigration is compared with the disk lifetime. In the disk-dominated regime, the\ntype II migration timescale is characterized by a {\\it local} viscous diffusion\ntimescale, while the disk lifetime characterized by a {\\it global} diffusion\ntimescale that is much longer than the local one. Even in the planet-dominated\nregime where the inertia of the planet mass reduces the migration speed, the\ntimescale is still shorter than the disk lifetime except in the final disk\nevolution stage where the total disk mass decays below the planet mass. This\nsuggests that most giant planets plunge into the central stars within the disk\nlifetime, and it contradicts the exoplanet observations that gas giants are\npiled up at $r \\ga 1$AU. We examine additional processes that may arise in\nprotoplanetary disks: dead zones, photoevaporation of gas, and gas flow across\na gap formed by a type II migrator. Although they make the type II migration\ntimescale closer to the disk lifetime, we show that none of them can act as an\neffective barrier for rapid type II migration with the current knowledge of\nthese processes.

The large misalignment is consistent with the\nhypothesis that planets become Hot Jupiters with random orbital plane\nalignments early in a system's lifetime. We predict that as a result of the\nhighly misaligned, precessing system, the transits should disappear for months\nat a time over the course of the system's precession period. The precessing,\ngravity-darkened model also predicts other observable effects: changing orbit\ninclination that could be detected by radial velocity observations, changing\nstellar inclination that would manifest as varying v sin i, changing projected\nspin-orbit alignment that could be seen by the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect,\nchanging transit shapes over the course of the precession, and differing\nlightcurves as a function of wavelength.

Abstract: On 2013 November 28 Comet ISON (C/2012 S1) will pass by the Sun with a\nperihelion distance of 2.7 solar radii. Understanding the possible outcomes for\nthe comet's response to such a close passage by the Sun is important for\nplanning observational campaigns and for inferring ISON's physical properties.\nWe present new numerical simulations and interpret them in context with the\nhistorical track record of comet disruptions and of sungrazing comet behavior.\nHistorical data suggest that sizes below ~200 m are susceptible to destruction\nby sublimation driven mass loss, while we find that for ISON's perihelion\ndistance, densities lower than 0.1 g cm^-3 are required to tidally disrupt a\nretrograde or non-spinning body. Such low densities are substantially below the\nrange of the best-determined comet nucleus densities, though dynamically new\ncomets such as ISON have few measurements of physical properties. Disruption\nmay occur for prograde rotation at densities up to 0.7 g cm^-3, with the\nchances of disruption increasing for lower density, faster prograde rotation,\nand increasing elongation of the nucleus. Given current constraints on ISON's\nnucleus properties and the typically determined values for these properties\namong all comets, we find tidal disruption to be unlikely unless other factors\n(e.g., spin-up via torquing) affect ISON substantially. Whether or not\ndisruption occurs, the largest remnant must be big enough to survive subsequent\nmass loss due to sublimation in order for ISON to remain a viable comet well\nafter perihelion. \n\n"}

For hot Jupiters the bow shock will not form\ndirectly between the planet and the star, causing an asymmetric distribution of\nmass around the exoplanet and hence an asymmetric transit. As the planet orbits\nthorough varying wind conditions, the strength and geometry of its bow shock\nwill change, thus producing transits of varying shape. We model this process\nusing magnetic maps of HD 189733 taken one year apart, coupled with a 3D\nstellar wind model, to determine the local stellar wind conditions throughout\nthe orbital path of the planet. We predict the time-varying geometry and\ndensity of the bow shock that forms around the magnetosphere of the planet and\nsimulate transit light curves. Depending on the nature of the stellar magnetic\nfield, and hence its wind, we find that both the transit duration and ingress\ntime can vary when compared to optical light curves. We conclude that\nconsecutive near-UV transit light curves may vary significantly and can\ntherefore provide an insight into the structure and evolution of the stellar\nwind. \n\n"}

In the case\nwhere the dust to gas ratio is enhanced and turbulence is week, the instability\ngrows, even in gravitationally stable disks, on a timescale of order $10^{4-\n5}$yr at a radius of order 100AU. If we ignore the dynamical feedback from dust\ngrains in the gas equation of motion, the instability reduces to the so-called\n\"secular gravitational instability\", which was investigated previously as an\ninstability of dust in a fixed background gas flow. In this work, we solve the\nequations of motion for both gas and dust consistently and find that\nlong-wavelength perturbations are stable, in contrast to the secular\ngravitational instability in the simplified treatment. This may indicate that\nwe should not neglect small terms in equation of motion if the growth rate is\nsmall. The instability is expected to form ring structures in protoplanetary\ndisks. The width of the ring formed at a radius of 100 AU is a few tens of AU.\nTherefore, the instability is a candidate for the formation mechanism of\nobserved ring-like structures in disks.

Systems with 3-6 low-mass planets (or planet\ncandidates) produce a diversity of minimum-mass disks with surface density\nprofiles ranging from Sigma r^-3.2 to Sigma r^0.5 (5th-95th percentile). By\nsimulating the transit detection of populations of synthetic planetary systems\ndesigned to match the properties of observed super-Earth systems, we show that\na universal disk profile is statistically excluded at high confidence. Rather,\nthe underlying distribution of minimum-mass disks is characterized by a broad\nrange of surface density slopes. Models of gaseous disks can only explain a\nnarrow range of slopes (roughly between r^0 and r^-1.5). Yet accretion of\nterrestrial planets in a gas-free environment preserves the initial radial\ndistribution of building blocks. The known systems of hot super-Earths must\ntherefore not represent the structure of their parent gas disks and can not\nhave predominantly formed in situ.

The gravitational torque\non the disc from an inclined binary makes the disc precess around the binary\naxis, while the star-disc interaction torque due to the rotation-induced\nquadrupole makes the stellar spin and the disc angular momentum axes precess\naround each other. A significant star-disc misalignment angle can be generated\nfrom a small initial value as the star-disc system evolves in time such that\nthe two precession frequencies cross each other. This ``secular resonance''\nbehavior can be understood in a geometric way from the precession dynamics of\nspin and disc angular momenta. We derive the conditions for such resonance to\noccur, and find that they can be satisfied for reasonable protostar-disc-binary\nparameters. The evolution of star-disc inclination is also affected by mass\naccretion and by magnetic star-disc interaction torques, which can either\npromote or reduce star-disc misalignment. In general, as long as the initial\nbinary-disc inclination is greater than a few degrees, a variety of star-disc\nmisalignment angles can be generated within the disc lifetimes. We discuss the\nimplications of our results for the stellar spin orientations in binaries, for\nthe alignments/misalignments of protostellar discs and debris discs, and for\nthe stellar obliquities in exoplanetary systems. In particular, if hot Jupiters\nare produced by the Kozai effect induced by an external stellar companion, then\nit is likely that ``primordial'' star-disc misalignments are already generated\nby the star-disc-binary interactions.

Effects of\n  saturation, cooling and stellar irradiation Abstract: Context: Several recent studies have found that planet migration in adiabatic\ndiscs differs significantly from migration in isothermal discs. Depending on\nthe thermodynamic conditions, i.e., the effectiveness of radiative cooling, and\nthe radial surface density profile, planets migrate inward or outward. Clearly,\nthis will influence the semimajor axis - mass distribution of planets as\npredicted by population synthesis simulations. Aims: Our goal is to study the\nglobal effects of radiative cooling, viscous torque desaturation and gap\nopening as well as stellar irradiation on the tidal migration of a synthetic\nplanet population. Methods: We combine results from several analytical studies\nand 3D hydrodynamic simulations in a new semi-analytical migration model for\nthe application in our planet population synthesis calculations. Results: We\nfind a good agreement of our model with torques obtained in a 3D radiative\nhydrodynamic simulations. We find three convergence zones in a typical disc,\ntowards which planets migrate from the in- and outside, affecting strongly the\nmigration behavior of low-mass planets. Interestingly, this leads to slow type\nII like migration behavior for low-mass planets captured in those zones even\nwithout an ad hoc migration rate reduction factor or a yet to be defined\nhalting mechanism.

Here I\ndemonstrate that equilibrium tides raised by a planet on its star can account\nfor three observed spin-orbit alignment trends: the aligned orbits of hot\nJupiters orbiting cool stars, the planetary mass cut-off for retrograde\nplanets, and the stratification by planet mass of cool host stars' rotation\nfrequencies. The first trend can be caused by strong versus weak magnetic\nbraking (the Kraft break), rather than realignment of the star's convective\nenvelope versus the entire star. The second trend can result from a small\neffective stellar moment of inertia participating in the tidal realignment in\nhot stars, enabling massive retrograde planets to partially realign to become\nprograde. The third trend is attributable to higher mass planets more\neffectively counteracting braking to spin up their stars. Both hot and cool\nstar require a small effective stellar moment of inertia participating in the\ntidal realignment, e.g., an outer layer weakly coupled to the interior.

The orbital\ninclination of Iapetus to the local Laplace plane is ~8 deg, which is\nunexpected, because the inclination should be ~0 if Iapetus formed from a\ncircumplanetary disk on the Laplace surface. It thus appears that some process\nhas pumped up Iapetus's inclination while leaving its eccentricity near zero\n(e=0.03 at present). Here we examined the possibility that Iapetus's\ninclination was excited during the early solar system instability when\nencounters between Saturn and ice giants occurred. We found that the dynamical\neffects of planetary encounters on Iapetus's orbit sensitively depend on the\ndistance of the few closest encounters. In four out of ten instability cases\nstudied here, the orbital perturbations were too large to be plausible. In one\ncase, Iapetus's orbit was practically unneffected. In the remaining five cases,\nthe perturbations of Iapetus's inclination were adequate to explain its present\nvalue. In three of these cases, however, Iapetus's eccentricity was excited to\n0.1-0.25, and it is not clear whether it could have been damped to its present\nvalue (0.03) by some subsequent process (e.g., tides and dynamical friction\nfrom captured irregular satellites do not seem to be strong enough).

Such disks with barotropic equilibria can be\napproximately modeled using the shearing box framework, representing a small\ndisk volume with height-independent angular frequency. If the disk is in\nbaroclinic equilibrium, the angular frequency does generally depend on height,\nand it is thus necessary to go beyond the standard shearing box approach.

HATS-6 is one of the lowest mass stars known to host a\nclose-in gas giant planet, and its transits are among the deepest of any known\ntransiting planet system. We discuss the follow-up opportunities afforded by\nthis system, noting that despite the faintness of the host star, it is expected\nto have the highest K-band S/N transmission spectrum among known gas giant\nplanets with Teq < 750 K.

Using detailed numerical calculations\nwe find that this evolution is quite rapid, potentially leading to complete\nremoval of the gaseous envelope in a few Gyr, and leaving behind an exposed\nrocky core (\"hot super-Earth\"). Final orbital periods are quite sensitive to\nthe details of the planet's mass-radius relation, and to the effects of\nirradiation and photo-evaporation, but could be as short as a few hours, or as\nlong as several days.

We present a technique for generating photometric light curves from\npixel-level data obtained with the two-wheeled extended Kepler mission, K2.

Though\ncounterintuitive, this assertion follows directly from stellar tidal\ninteraction theory and the evolution of lower mass stars. There is strong\nevidence that chromospheric activity of rapidly rotating young stars may be\nhigh enough to cause mass loss from atmospheres of potentially habitable\nplanets. The removal of atmospheric water is most critical. Tidal breaking in\nbinaries could help reduce magnetic dynamo action and thereby chromospheric\nactivity in favor of life. We call this the Binary Habitability Mechanism\n(BHM), that we suggest allows for water retention at levels comparable to or\nbetter than Earth. We discuss novel advantages that life may exploit, in these\ncases, and suggest that life may even thrive on some circumbinary planets. We\nfind that while many binaries do not benefit from BHM, high quality niches do\nexist for various combinations of stars between 0.55 and 1.0 solar masses. For\na given pair of stellar masses, BHM operates only for certain combinations of\nperiod and eccentricity. Binaries having a solar-type primary seem to be quite\nwell suited niches having wide and distant habitable zones with plentiful water\nand sufficient light for photosynthetic life. We speculate that, as a direct\nresult of BHM, conditions may be suitable for life on several planets and\npossibly even moons of giant planets orbiting some binaries.

Our\napproach is to use the full kinetics model to survey the parameter space with\neffective temperatures between 500 K and 1100 K. In all of these worlds\nequilibrium chemistry favors CH4 over CO in the parts of the atmosphere that\ncan be seen from Earth, but in most disequilibrium favors CO. The small surface\ngravity of a planet strongly discriminates against CH4 when compared to an\notherwise comparable brown dwarf. If vertical mixing is like Jupiter's, the\ntransition from methane to CO occurs at 500 K in a planet. Sluggish vertical\nmixing can raise this to 600 K; but clouds or more vigorous vertical mixing\ncould lower this to 400 K. The comparable thresholds in brown dwarfs are\n$1100\\pm100$ K. Ammonia is also sensitive to gravity, but unlike CH4/CO, the\nNH3/N2 ratio is insensitive to mixing, which makes NH3 a potential proxy for\ngravity. HCN may become interesting in high gravity brown dwarfs with very\nstrong vertical mixing.

The orbit of a\nplanet around a binary stellar system poses several dynamic constraints. The\neffects that radiation from the host stars may have on the planet atmospheres\nmust be considered. Because of the configuration of a close binary system,\nthese stars have a high rotation rate, which causes a permanent state of high\nstellar activity and copious XUV radiation. The accumulated effects are\nstronger than for exoplanets around single stars, and cause a faster\nevaporation of their atmospheres. We evaluate the effects that stellar\nradiation has on the evaporation of exoplanets around binary systems and on the\nsurvival of these planets. We considered the XUV spectral range to account for\nthe photons that are easily absorbed by a planet atmosphere that is mainly\ncomposed of hydrogen. A more complex atmospheric composition is expected to\nabsorb this radiation more efficiently. We used direct X-ray observations to\nevaluate the energy in the X-rays range and coronal models to calculate the\n(nondetectable) EUV part of the spectrum. The simulations show that exoplanets\nin a close orbit will suffer strong photoevaporation that may cause a total\nloss of atmosphere in a short time. A binary system of two solar-like stars\nwill be highly efficient in evaporating the atmosphere of the planet. These\nsystems will be difficult to find, even if they are dynamically stable. Still,\nplanets may orbit around binary systems of low mass stars for wider orbits.\nCurrently known circumbinary planets are not substantially affected by thermal\nphotoevaporation processes, unless Kepler-47 b has an inflated atmosphere. The\ndistribution of the orbital periods of circumbinary planets is shifted to much\nlonger periods than the average of Kepler planets, which supports a scenario of\nstrong photoevaporation in close-in circumbinary planets. \n\n"}

All three\nnon-ideal MHD effects, Ohmic resistivity, the Hall effect and ambipolar\ndiffusion are included in a self-consistent manner based on equilibrium\nchemistry. We focus on regions toward outer disk radii, from 5-60AU, where\nOhmic resistivity tends to become negligible, ambipolar diffusion dominates\nover an extended region across disk height, and the Hall effect largely\ncontrols the dynamics near the disk midplane. We find that around R=5AU, the\nsystem launches a laminar/weakly turbulent magnetocentrifugal wind when the net\nvertical field Bz is not too weak, as expected. Moreover, the wind is able to\nachieve and maintain a configuration with reflection symmetry at disk midplane.\nThe case with anti-aligned field polarity (Omega. Bz<0) is more susceptible to\nthe MRI when Bz drops, leading to an outflow oscillating in radial directions\nand very inefficient angular momentum transport. At the outer disk around and\nbeyond R=30AU, the system shows vigorous MRI turbulence in the surface layer\ndue to far-UV ionization, which efficiently drives disk accretion. The Hall\neffect affects the stability of the midplane region to the MRI, leading to\nstrong/weak Maxwell stress for aligned/anti-aligned field polarities.\nNevertheless, the midplane region is only very weakly turbulent.

For the first time, we apply the moving-mesh\ncode AREPO, to circumstellar discs in 3-D, focusing on disc-disc interactions\nthat result from stellar fly-bys. Although a small fraction of stars are\nexpected to undergo close approaches, the outcomes of the most violent\nencounters might leave an imprint on the discs and host stars that will\ninfluence both their orbits and their ability to form planets. We first\nconstruct well-behaved 3-D models of self-gravitating discs, and then create a\nsuite of numerical experiments of parabolic encounters, exploring the effects\nof pericenter separation r_p, disc orientation and disc-star mass ratio\n(M_d/M_*) on the orbital evolution of the host stars. Close encounters (2r_p<~\ndisc radius) can truncate discs on very short time scales. If discs are\nmassive, close encounters facilitate enough orbital angular momentum extraction\nto induce stellar capture. We find that for realistic primordial disc masses\nM_d<~0.1M_*, non-colliding encounters induce minor orbital changes, which is\nconsistent with analytic calculations of encounters in the linear regime. The\nsame disc masses produce entirely different results for grazing/colliding\nencounters. In the latter case, rapidly cooling discs lose orbital energy by\nradiating away the energy excess of the shock-heated gas, thus causing capture\nof the host stars into a bound orbit.

It is caused by sunlight; when these bodies heat up in the Sun, they\neventually re-radiate the energy away in the thermal waveband, which in turn\ncreates a tiny thrust. This recoil acceleration is much weaker than solar and\nplanetary gravitational forces, but it can produce measurable orbital changes\nover decades and substantial orbital effects over millions to billions of\nyears. The same physical phenomenon also creates a thermal torque that,\ncomplemented by a torque produced by scattered sunlight, can modify the\nrotation rates and obliquities of small bodies as well.

Probability distributions of possible solutions are commonly\ngenerated by Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, but these are biased by priors and\nmay not probe the full parameter space. We suggest alternative methods to\ncharacterise possible orbits, which compliment the MCMC technique. Firstly the\nallowed ranges of orbital elements are prior-independent, and we provide means\nto calculate these ranges without numerical analyses. Hence several interesting\nconstraints (including whether a companion even can be bound, its minimum\npossible semi-major axis and its minimum eccentricity) may be quickly computed\nusing our relations as soon as orbital motion is detected. We also suggest an\nalternative to posterior probability distributions as a means to present\npossible orbital elements, namely contour plots of elements as functions of\nline of sight coordinates. These plots are prior-independent, readily show\ndegeneracies between elements and allow readers to extract orbital solutions\nthemselves.

The outcome of our numerical simulations depends a lot on the\nchoice of the initial distribution of planetesimals and planetary embryos after\ngas disappeared in the protoplanetary disk.

We assume that the gas giants and terrestrial\nplanets are already formed when we check the collisions of the small bodies\ncontaining water (in the order of a few percent) with the terrestrial planets.\nWe thus are able to give an estimate of the respective contribution to the\nactual water content (of some Earth-oceans) in the mantle, in the crust and on\nthe surface of Earth.

We find\nthat even when the criterion is satisfied, there are instances when planets\nstill do not open gaps. We stress that gap-opening is not only dependent on\nwhether a planet has the ability to open a gap, but whether it can do so\nquickly enough. This can be expressed as an additional condition on the\ngap-opening timescale versus the crossing time, i.e. the time it takes the\nplanet to cross the region which it is carving out. While this point has been\nbriefly made in the previous literature, our results quantify it for a range of\nprotoplanetary disk properties and planetary masses, demonstrating how crucial\nit is for gap-opening. This additional condition has important implications for\nthe survival of planets formed by core accretion in low mass disks as well as\ngiant planets or brown dwarfs formed by gravitational instability in massive\ndisks.

In multi-planet systems,\nconvergent amassing of orbits inevitably leads to encounters with rational\nperiod ratios, which may result in establishment of mean motion resonances. The\nsuccess or failure of resonant capture yields exceedingly different subsequent\nevolutions, and thus plays a central role in determining the ensuing orbital\narchitecture of planetary systems. In this work, we employ an integrable\nHamiltonian formalism for first order planetary resonances that allows both\nsecondary bodies to have finite masses and eccentricities, and construct a\ncomprehensive theory for resonant capture. Particularly, we derive conditions\nunder which orbital evolution lies within the adiabatic regime, and provide a\ngeneralized criterion for guaranteed resonant locking as well as a procedure\nfor calculating capture probabilities when capture is not certain.\nSubsequently, we utilize the developed analytical model to examine the\nevolution of Jupiter and Saturn within the protosolar nebula, and investigate\nthe origins of the dominantly non-resonant orbital distribution of sub-Jovian\nextrasolar planets. Our calculations show that the commonly observed extrasolar\norbital structure can be understood if planet pairs encounter mean motion\ncommensurabilities on slightly eccentric (e~0.02) orbits.

Here\nwe propose that a potential outcome of this atmospheric evolution is the\nformation of helium-dominated atmospheres. The hydrodynamic escape rates of\nNeptune- and sub-Neptune-sized exoplanets are comparable to the\ndiffusion-limited escape rate of hydrogen, and therefore the escape is heavily\naffected by diffusive separation between hydrogen and helium. A helium\natmosphere can thus be formed -- from a primordial hydrogen-helium atmosphere\n-- via atmospheric hydrodynamic escape from the planet. The helium atmosphere\nhas very different abundances of major carbon and oxygen species from those of\na hydrogen atmosphere, leading to distinctive transmission and thermal emission\nspectral features. In particular, the hypothesis of a helium-dominated\natmosphere can explain the thermal emission spectrum of GJ 436 b, a warm\nNeptune-sized exoplanet, while also consistent with the transmission spectrum.\nThis model atmosphere contains trace amounts of hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen,\nwith the predominance of CO over CH4 as the main form of carbon. With our\natmospheric evolution model, we find that if the mass of the initial atmosphere\nenvelope is 1E-3 planetary mass, hydrodynamic escape can reduce the hydrogen\nabundance in the atmosphere by several orders of magnitude in ~10 billion\nyears. Observations of exoplanet transits may thus detect signatures of helium\natmospheres and probe the evolutionary history of small exoplanets. \n\n"}

This gas envelope, if more massive\nthan a few percent of the core (with a mass below $10 M_\\oplus$), has a cooling\ntime that is much longer than the time-scale on which the planet exits the\ndisk. As such, it could not have contracted significantly from its original\nsize, of order the Bondi radius. So a newly exposed proto-planet would be\nlosing mass via a Parker wind that is catalyzed by the stellar continuum\nradiation. This represents an intermediate stage of mass-loss, occurring soon\nafter the disc has dispersed, but before the EUV/X-ray driven photoevaporation\nbecomes relevant. The surface mass-loss induces a mass movement within the\nenvelope that advects internal heat outward. As a result, the planet atmosphere\nrapidly cools down and contracts, until it has reached a radius of order $0.1$\nBondi radius, at which time the mass-loss effectively shuts down.

But rather high interior temperatures (~10^5 K) and a stratified D\nlayer are needed, making such a scenario unlikely. In this paper, we re-examine\nDD fusion, with the addition of screening effects pertinent to a deuterated\ncore containing ice and some heavy elements. This alleviates the extreme\ntemperature constraint and removes the requirement of a stratified D layer. As\nan application, we propose that, if their core temperatures are a few times\n10^4 K and core composition is chemically inhomogeneous, the observed inflated\nsize of some giant exoplanets (\"hot Jupiters\") may be linked to screened DD\nfusion occurring deep in the interior. Application of an analytic evolution\nmodel suggests that the amount of inflation from this effect can be important\nif there is sufficient rock-ice in the core, making DD fusion an effective\nextra internal energy source for radius inflation. The mechanism of screened DD\nfusion, operating in the above temperature range, is generally consistent with\nthe trend in radius anomaly with planetary equilibrium temperature $T_{\\rm\neq}$, and also depends on planetary mass.

The\ncompanion, CoRoT-33b, is thus a new member in the so-called brown dwarf desert.\nThe orbital period is within 3% to a 3:2 resonance with the rotational period\nof the star. CoRoT-33b may be an important test case for tidal evolution\nstudies. The true frequency of brown dwarfs close to their host stars (P < 10\nd) is estimated to be approximately 0.2% which is about six times smaller than\nthe frequency of hot Jupiters in the same period range. We suspect that the\nfrequency of brown dwarfs declines faster with decreasing period than that of\ngiant planets. \n\n"}

Abstract: Protoplanetary discs are now routinely observed and exoplanets, after the\nnumerous indirect discoveries, are starting to be directly imaged. To better\nunderstand the planet formation process, the next step is the detection of\nforming planets or of signposts of young planets still in their disc, such as\ngaps. A spectacular example is the ALMA science verification image of HL Tau\nshowing numerous gaps and rings in its disc. To study the observability of\nplanet gaps, we ran 3D hydrodynamical simulations of a gas and dust disc\ncontaining a 5 M J gap-opening planet and characterised the spatial\ndistribution of migrating, growing and fragmenting dust grains. We then\ncomputed the corresponding synthetic images for ALMA. For a value of the dust\nfragmentation threshold of 15 m s --1 for the collisional velocity, we identify\nfor the first time a self-induced dust pile up in simulations taking\nfragmentation into account. This feature, in addition to the easily detected\nplanet gap, causes a second apparent gap that could be mistaken for the\nsignature of a second planet. It is therefore essential to be cautious in the\ninterpretation of gap detections. \n\n"}

The observations of SR21 show a clear shift in the\nvisibility nulls, indicating radial variations of the inner edge of the cavity\nat the two wavelengths. Notable radial variations of the spectral index are\nalso detected for SR21 with values of $\\alpha_{\\rm{mm}}{\\sim}3.8-4.2$ in the\ninner region ($r<35$ AU) and $\\alpha_{\\rm{mm}}{\\sim}2.6-3.0$ outside.

For SR21, the\nring model better fits the emission at 336GHz, conversely the vortex model\nbetter fits the 689GHz emission.

The disk shows strong azimuthal asymmetry in the dust continuum\nemission, while gas emission is more symmetric. In this paper, we investigate\nhow gas and dust are distributed in the dust-bright northern part of the disk\nand in the dust-faint southern part. We construct two axisymmetric disk models.\nOne reproduces the radial profiles of the continuum and the velocity moments 0\nand 1 of CO lines in the north and the other reproduces those in the south. We\nhave found that the dust is concentrated in a narrow ring having ~50AU width\n(in FWHM; w_d=30AU in our parameter definition) located at ~170-200AU from the\ncentral star. The dust particles are strongly concentrated in the north. We\nhave found that the dust surface density contrast between the north and south\namounts to ~70. Compared to the dust, the gas distribution is more extended in\nthe radial direction. We find that the gas component extends at least from\n~100AU to ~250AU from the central star, and there should also be tenuous gas\nremaining inside and outside of these radii. The azimuthal asymmetry of gas\ndistribution is much smaller than dust. The gas surface density differs only by\na factor of ~3-10 between the north and south.

The key novelty is the introduction of physically\nmotivated, radially varying, maximum and minimum impact parameters. With these,\nour model gives an excellent match to full N-body simulations for isotropic\nbackground density distributions, both cuspy and shallow, without any\nfine-tuning of the model parameters. In particular, we are able to reproduce\nthe dramatic core-stalling effect that occurs in shallow/constant density\ncores, for the first time. This gives us new physical insight into the\ncore-stalling phenomenon. We show that core stalling occurs in the limit in\nwhich the product of the Coulomb logarithm and the local fraction of stars with\nvelocity lower than the infalling body tends to zero. For cuspy backgrounds,\nthis occurs when the infalling mass approaches the enclosed background mass.\nFor cored backgrounds, it occurs at larger distances from the centre, due to a\ncombination of a rapidly increasing minimum impact parameter and a lack of slow\nmoving stars in the core. This demonstrates that the physics of core-stalling\nis likely the same for both massive infalling objects and low-mass objects\nmoving in shallow density backgrounds. We implement our prescription for\ndynamical friction in the direct summation code NBODY6 as an analytic\ncorrection for stars that remain within the Roche volume of the infalling\nobject. This approach is computationally efficient, since only stars in the\ninspiralling system need to be evolved with direct summation. Our method can be\napplied to study a variety of astrophysical systems, including young star\nclusters orbiting near the Galactic Centre; globular clusters moving within the\nGalaxy; and dwarf galaxies orbiting within dark matter halos. \n\n"}

The NaI 5889.95 angstrom line is detected toward all but one\nsource, while the weaker KI 7698.96 angstrom line in about two thirds of the\nsample. The similarity in their peak centroids and the significant positive\ncorrelation between their equivalent widths demonstrate that these transitions\ntrace the same atomic gas. The absorption lines are present towards both disk\nand diskless young stellar objects, which excludes cold gas within the\ncircumstellar disk as the absorbing material. A comparison of NaI and CO\ndetections and peak centroids demonstrates that the atomic and molecular gas\nare not co-located, the atomic gas is more extended than the molecular gas. The\nwidth of the atomic lines corroborates this finding and points to atomic gas\nabout an order of magnitude warmer than the molecular gas. The distribution of\nNaI radial velocities shows a clear spatial gradient along the length of the\nTaurus molecular cloud filaments.

In this paper, we study a sample of giant transiting exoplanets\ndetected by the Kepler telescope with orbital periods up to 400 days. We first\ndefined a sample of 129 giant-planet candidates that we followed up with the\nSOPHIE spectrograph (OHP, France) in a 6-year radial velocity campaign. This\nallow us to unveil the nature of these candidates and to measure a\nfalse-positive rate of 54.6 +/- 6.5 % for giant-planet candidates orbiting\nwithin 400 days of period. Based on a sample of confirmed or likely planets, we\nthen derive the occurrence rates of giant planets in different ranges of\norbital periods. The overall occurrence rate of giant planets within 400 days\nis 4.6 +/- 0.6 %. We recover, for the first time in the Kepler data, the\ndifferent populations of giant planets reported by radial velocity surveys.\nComparing these rates with other yields, we find that the occurrence rate of\ngiant planets is lower only for hot jupiters but not for the longer period\nplanets.

These\nsimulations allow us to make substantial progress in mapping out the asymmetric\nthree-dimensional GHZ and its time evolution for the Milky Way (MW) and\nTriangulum (M33) galaxies, as opposed to works that generally assume an\nazimuthally symmetric GHZ.\n  Applying typical habitability metrics to MW and M33, we find that while a\nlarge number of habitable planets exist as close as a few kiloparsecs from the\ngalactic centre, the probability of individual planetary systems being\nhabitable rises as one approaches the edge of the stellar disc. Tidal streams\nand satellite galaxies also appear to be fertile grounds for habitable planet\nformation.\n  In short, we find that both galaxies arrive at similar GHZs by different\nevolutionary paths, as measured by the first and third quartiles of surviving\nbiospheres. For the Milky Way, this interquartile range begins as a narrow band\nat large radii, expanding to encompass much of the galaxy at intermediate times\nbefore settling at a range of 2-13kpc.

This suggests that galaxy assembly history\nstrongly influences the time evolution of the GHZ, which will affect the\nrelative time lag between biospheres in different galactic locations.

Previous studies using simulated\nphotometry of Earth show that continuous observations over most of a planet's\norbit can be inverted to infer obliquity. However, few studies of more general\nplanets with arbitrary albedo markings have been made and, in particular, a\nsimple theoretical understanding of why it is possible to extract obliquity\nfrom light curves is missing. Reflected light seen by a distant observer is the\nproduct of a planet's albedo map, its host star's illumination, and the\nvisibility of different regions. It is useful to treat the product of\nillumination and visibility as the kernel of a convolution. Time-resolved\nphotometry constrains both the albedo map and the kernel, the latter of which\nsweeps over the planet due to rotational and orbital motion. The kernel's\nmovement distinguishes prograde from retrograde rotation for planets with\nnon-zero obliquity on inclined orbits. We demonstrate that the kernel's\nlongitudinal width and mean latitude are distinct functions of obliquity and\naxial orientation. Notably, we find that a planet's spin axis affects the\nkernel -- and hence time-resolved photometry -- even if this planet is\nEast-West uniform or spinning rapidly, or if it is North-South uniform. We find\nthat perfect knowledge of the kernel at 2-4 orbital phases is usually\nsufficient to uniquely determine a planet's spin axis.

Such\nmultiply-averaged Hamiltonian is used to study the lunisolar resonances which\ndepend just on the inclination.\n  Borrowing the technique from the theory of bifurcations of Hamiltonian normal\nforms, we study the birth of periodic orbits and we determine the energy\nthresholds at which the bifurcations of lunisolar secular resonances take\nplace. This approach gives us physically relevant information on the existence\nand location of the equilibria, which help us to identify stable and unstable\nregions in the phase space. Besides their physical interest, the study of\ninclination dependent resonances offers interesting insights from the dynamical\npoint of view, since it sheds light on different phenomena related to\nbifurcation theory. \n\n"}

In\nthese systems, some of the open field lines do not allow the flow to pass\nsmoothly through the sonic point, so that steady-state solutions do not exist\nin general. This paper focuses on this type of magnetic field configuration,\nwhere the resulting flow becomes manifestly time-dependent. We consider the\ncase of both steady heating and time-variable heating, and find the time scales\nfor the corresponding time variations of the outflow. Because the flow cannot\npass through the sonic transition, it remains subsonic and leads to so-called\nbreeze solutions. One manifestation of the time variability is that the flow\nsamples a collection of different breeze solutions over time, and the mass\noutflow rate varies in quasi-periodic fashion. Because the flow is subsonic,\ninformation can propagate inward from the outer boundary, which determines, in\npart, the time scale of the flow variability. This work finds the relationship\nbetween the outer boundary scale and the time scale of flow variations. In\npractice, the location of the outer boundary is set by the extent of the sphere\nof influence of the planet.

We present HARPS\nobservations of sunlight scattered off the bright asteroid 4/Vesta, from which\nwe deduced the Sun's activity-driven RV variations. In parallel, the HMI\ninstrument onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory provided us with simultaneous\nhigh spatial resolution magnetograms, Dopplergrams, and continuum images of the\nSun in the Fe I 6173A line. We determine the RV modulation arising from the\nsuppression of granular blueshift in magnetised regions and the flux imbalance\ninduced by dark spots and bright faculae. The rms velocity amplitudes of these\ncontributions are 2.40 m/s and 0.41 m/s, respectively, which confirms that the\ninhibition of convection is the dominant source of activity-induced RV\nvariations at play, in accordance with previous studies.

An increase in the water fraction inside the disc, maintaining a fixed\ndust abundance, increases the temperature in the icy regions of the disc and\nlowers the temperature in the inner regions. Discs with a larger silicate\nfraction have the opposite effect. Here we explore the consequence of the dust\ncomposition and abundance for the formation and migration of planets. We find\nthat discs with low water content can only sustain outwards migration for\nplanets up to 4 Earth masses, while outwards migration in discs with a larger\nwater content persists up to 8 Earth masses in the late stages of the disc\nevolution. Icy planetary cores that do not reach run-away gas accretion can\nthus migrate to orbits close to the host star if the water abundance is low.\nOur results imply that hot and warm super-Earths found in exoplanet surveys\ncould have formed beyond the ice line and thus contain a significant fraction\nin water.

Our publicly available code,\nForecaster, accounts for observational errors, hyper-parameter uncertainties\nand the intrinsic dispersions observed in the calibration sample. By\nconditioning our model upon a sample spanning dwarf planets to late-type stars,\nForecaster can predict the mass (or radius) from the radius (or mass) for\nobjects covering nine orders-of-magnitude in mass.

To do this, however, also the same parameters of its host star are\nneeded. By using spectroscopy, I participated in TRANSITS, an RV follow-up\nprogram of Kepler Objects of Interest.

These close planets origins are a mystery that motivates\ninvestigating protoplanetary disks central regions. A key factor governing the\nconditions near the star is the silicate sublimation front, which largely\ndetermines where the starlight is absorbed, and which is often called the inner\nrim. We present the first radiation hydrodynamical modeling of the sublimation\nfront in the disks around the young intermediate-mass stars called Herbig Ae\nstars. The models are axisymmetric, and include starlight heating, silicate\ngrains sublimating and condensing to equilibrium at the local, time-dependent\ntemperature and density, and accretion stresses parametrizing the results of\nMHD magneto-rotational turbulence models. The results compare well with\nradiation hydrostatic solutions, and prove to be dynamically stable.

A\nsmall optically-thin halo of hot dust naturally arises between the inner rim\nand the star. The inner rim has a substantial radial extent, corresponding to\nseveral disk scale heights. While the fronts overall position varies with the\nstellar luminosity, its radial extent depends on the mass accretion rate.

The\ncentral star grows by accretion from the disk, and irradiation by the central\nstar heats up the disk and generates thermal wind, which results in the disk\ndispersal. We calculate the evolution of protoplanetary disks from their parent\npre-stellar cores to dispersal of the disks. We find that the disk lifetimes of\ntypical pre-stellar cores are around 2--4 million years (Myr). A pre-stellar\ncore with high angular momentum forms a larger disk whose lifetime is long,\nwhile a disk around a X-ray luminous star has a short lifetime. Integrating the\ndisk lifetimes under various mass and angular velocity of prestellar cores and\nX-ray luminosities of young stellar objects, we obtain disk fraction at a given\nstellar age and mean lifetime of the disks.

For typical Galactic lensing events with the Einstein radius of\n$\\sim 2$ AU, the asymmetry of the light curves due to bound planets can be\nnoticed up to $\\sim 20$AU.

Abstract: Occultation light curves of exomoons may give information on their albedo and\nhence indicate the presence of ice cover on the surface. Icy moons might have\nsubsurface oceans thus these may potentially be habitable. The objective of our\npaper is to determine whether next generation telescopes will be capable of\nalbedo estimations for icy exomoons using their occultation light curves. The\nsuccess of the measurements depends on the depth of the moon's occultation in\nthe light curve and on the sensitivity of the used instruments. We applied\nsimple calculations for different stellar masses in the V and J photometric\nbands, and compared the flux drop caused by the moon's occultation and the\nestimated photon noise of next generation missions with 5 $\\sigma$ confidence.\nWe found that albedo estimation by this method is not feasible for moons of\nsolar-like stars, but small M dwarfs are better candidates for such\nmeasurements. Our calculations in the J photometric band show that E-ELT\nMICADO's photon noise is just about 4 ppm greater than the flux difference\ncaused by a 2 Earth-radii icy satellite in a circular orbit at the snowline of\nan 0.1 stellar mass star. However, considering only photon noise underestimates\nthe real expected noise, because other noise sources, such as CCD read-out and\ndark signal become significant in the near infrared measurements. Hence we\nconclude that occultation measurements with next generation missions are far\ntoo challenging, even in the case of large, icy moons at the snowline of small\nM dwarfs. We also discuss the role of the parameters that were neglected in the\ncalculations, e.g. inclination, eccentricity, orbiting direction of the moon.\nWe predict that the first albedo estimations of exomoons will probably be made\nfor large icy moons around the snowline of M4 -- M9 type main sequence stars. \n\n"}

These size-dependent dust density\ndistributions are used for follow-up three-dimensional radiative transfer\ncalculations to predict the polarization degree at ALMA bands due to scattered\nthermal emission. We find that the polarization pattern of a disk with a\nplanetary gap after 1 Myr of dust evolution shows a distinctive three ring\nstructure.

Here we present the result of a\nreconnaissance survey looking for dormant comets using 13~567~542 meteor orbits\nmeasured by the Canadian Meteor Orbit Radar (CMOR). We simulate the dynamical\nevolution of the hypothetical meteoroid streams originated from 407 near-Earth\nasteroids in cometary orbits (NEACOs) that resemble orbital characteristics of\nJupiter-family comets (JFCs).

We demonstrate quantitatively that the\npredicted and observed structure of such discs are prime birthsites of planets.\nPlanet formation is likely to proceed through pebble accretion, should a\nplanetary embryo ($M\\gtrsim 10^{-4}\\,$M$_\\oplus$) form. Efficient pebble\naccretion is likely to be unavoidable in transition disc dust traps, as the\nsize of the dust particles required for pebble accretion are those which are\nmost efficiently trapped in the transition disc dust trap. Rapid pebble\naccretion within the dust trap gives rise, not only to low-mass planets, but to\na large accretion luminosity. This accretion luminosity is sufficient to heat\nthe disc outside the gravitational influence of the planet and makes the disc\nlocally baroclinic, and a source of vorticity. Using numerical simulations we\ndemonstrate that this source of vorticity can lead to the growth of a single\nlarge scale vortex in $\\sim 100$ orbits, which is capable of trapping\nparticles. Finally, we suggest an evolutionary cycle: planet formation proceeds\nthrough pebble accretion, followed by vortex formation and particle trapping in\nthe vortex quenching the planetary accretion and thus removing the vorticity\nsource. After the vortex is destroyed the process can begin anew. This means\ntransition discs should present with large scale vortices for a significant\nfraction of their lifetimes and remnant planets at large ~10AU separation\nshould be a common outcome of this cycle. \n\n"}

Theoretical\nmodels predict a positive correlation between heat redistribution efficiency\nand temperature for tidally locked planets; however, recent HST WASP-43b\nspectroscopic phase curve results are inconsistent with current predictions.\nUsing the Spitzer Space Telescope, we obtained a total of three phase curve\nobservations of WASP-43b (P=0.813 days) at 3.6 and 4.5 microns. The first 3.6\nmicron visit exhibits spurious nightside emission that requires invoking\nunphysical conditions in our cloud-free atmospheric retrievals. The two other\nvisits exhibit strong day-night contrasts that are consistent with the HST\ndata. To reconcile the departure from theoretical predictions, WASP-43b would\nneed to have a high-altitude, nightside cloud/haze layer blocking its thermal\nemission. Clouds/hazes could be produced within the planet's cool, nearly\nretrograde mid-latitude flows before dispersing across its nightside at high\naltitudes.

We use these outcomes to consider which planetary\nsystem architectures maximise the observability of specific signatures, given\nthat signatures should be detected first around systems with optimal\narchitectures (if such systems exist in nature). Giant impact debris is most\nreadily detectable for 0.1-10Mearth planets at 1-5au, depending on detection\nmethod and spectral type. While A stars have putative giant impact debris at\n4-6au consistent with this sweet spot, that of FGK stars is typically <<1au\ncontrary to expectations; an absence of 1-3au giant impact debris could\nindicate a low frequency of terrestrial planets there. Three principles\nmaximise cometary influx from exo-Kuiper belts: a chain of closely separated\nplanets interior to the belt, none of which is a Jupiter-like ejector; planet\nmasses not increasing strongly with distance (for a net inward torque on\ncomets); ongoing replenishment of comets, possibly by embedded low-mass\nplanets. A high Oort Cloud comet influx requires no ejector and architectures\nthat maximise the Oort Cloud population. Cold debris disks are usually\nconsidered classical Kuiper belt analogues.

Abstract: [Abridged] Regions of low ionisation where the activity of the\nmagneto-rotational instability is suppressed, the so-called dead zones, have\nbeen suggested to explain gaps and asymmetries of transition disks. We\ninvestigate the gas and dust evolution simultaneously assuming simplified\nprescriptions for a dead zone and a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wind acting on\nthe disk. We explore whether the resulting gas and dust distribution can create\nsignatures similar to those observed in transition disks. For the dust\nevolution, we included the transport, growth, and fragmentation of dust\nparticles. To compare with observations, we produced synthetic images in\nscattered optical light and in thermal emission at mm wavelengths. In all\nmodels with a dead zone, a bump in the gas surface density is produced that is\nable to efficiently trap large particles ($\\gtrsim 1$ mm) at the outer edge of\nthe dead zone. The gas bump reaches an amplitude of a factor of $\\sim5$, which\ncan be enhanced by the presence of an MHD wind that removes mass from the inner\ndisk. While our 1D simulations suggest that such a structure can be present\nonly for $\\sim$1 Myr, the structure may be maintained for a longer time when\nmore realistic 2D/3D simulations are performed. In the synthetic images,\ngap-like low-emission regions are seen at scattered light and in thermal\nemission at mm wavelengths, as previously predicted in the case of planet-disk\ninteraction. As a conclusion, main signatures of transition disks can be\nreproduced by assuming a dead zone in the disk, such as gap-like structure in\nscattered light and millimetre continuum emission, and a lower gas surface\ndensity within the dead zone. Previous studies showed that the Rossby wave\ninstability can also develop at the edge of such dead zones, forming vortices\nand also creating asymmetries. \n\n"}

We compare the results of simulations without any\nradiative feedback from secondary objects with those where two types of\nradiative feedback are considered: (i) continuous, and (ii) episodic. We find\nthat: (i) continuous radiative feedback stabilizes the disc and suppresses\nfurther fragmentation, reducing the number secondary objects formed; (ii)\nepisodic feedback from secondary objects heats and stabilises the disc when the\noutburst occurs, but shortly after the outburst stops, the disc becomes\nunstable and fragments again. However, fewer secondary objects are formed\ncompared to the the case without radiative feedback.

Determining the origin of these highly irradiated rocky planets will\nbe critical to our understanding of low-mass planet formation and the frequency\nof potentially habitable Earth-like planets. These short-period rocky\nsuper-Earths could simply be the stripped cores of sub-Neptunes, which have\nlost their envelopes due to atmospheric photo-evaporation or other processes,\nor they might instead be a separate population of inherently rocky planets,\nwhich never had significant envelopes. Using models of atmospheric\nphoto-evaporation, we show that if most bare rocky planets are the evaporated\ncores of sub-Neptunes then the transition radius should decrease as surveys\npush to longer orbital periods, since on wider orbits only planets with smaller\nless massive cores can be stripped.

Pebble accretion has been\ndemonstrated to play an important role in core accretion and to have growth\nrates that are consistent with planetary migration. The high pebble accretion\nrates allow planetary cores to start their growth beyond 10 AU and subsequently\nmigrate to cold (>~ 1 AU), warm (~0.1 AU- 1AU) or hot (<~ 0.1 AU) orbits. In\nthis work we investigate how the formation of giant planets via pebble\naccretion influences their atmospheric chemical compositions. We find that\nunder the standard pebble accretion scenario, where the core is isolated from\nthe envelope, the resulting metallicities (O/H and C/H ratios) are sub-solar,\nwhile the C/O ratios are super-solar. Planets that migrate through the disk to\nbecome hot Jupiters accrete substantial amounts of water vapour, but still\nacquire slightly sub-solar O/H and super-solar C/O of 0.7-0.8. The metallicity\ncan be substantially sub-solar (~0.2-0.5x solar) and the C/O can even approach\n1.0 if the planet accretes its envelope mostly beyond the CO2 ice line, i.e.\ncold Jupiters or hot Jupiters that form far out and migrate in by scattering.\nAllowing for core erosion yields significantly super-solar metallicities and\nsolar or sub-solar C/O, which can also be achieved by other means, e.g.\nphoto-evaporation and late-stage planetesimal accretion. \n\n"}

(2016a,b) and Beck\net al (2016a,b), we investigate the link between stellar activity, rotation,\nlithium abundance and oscillations in a group of 18 solar-analogue stars\nthrough space photometry, obtained with the NASA Kepler space telescope and\nfrom currently 50+ hours of ground-based, high-resolution spectroscopy with the\nHermes instrument. In these proceedings, we first discuss the selection of the\nstars in the sample, observations and calibrations and then summarise the main\nresults of the project. By investigating the chromospheric and photospheric\nactivity of the solar analogues in this sample, it was shown that for a large\nfraction of these stars the measured activity levels are compatible to levels\nof the 11-year solar activity cycle 23. A clear correlation between the lithium\nabundance and surface rotation was found for rotation periods shorter than the\nsolar value. Comparing the lithium abundance measured in the solar analogues to\nevolutionary models with the Toulouse-Geneva Evolutionary Code (TGEC), we found\nthat the solar models calibrated to the Sun also correctly describe the set of\nsolar/stellar analogs showing that they share the same internal mixing physics.\nFinally, the star KIC 3241581 and KIC 10644353 are discussed in more detail. \n\n"}

We consider a variant of\nthis model in which the companion is a giant planet with an orbital radius of a\nfew au. Guided by the results of published numerical simulations, we model the\ndynamical evolution of this system by dividing the disk into inner and outer\nparts---separated at the location of the planet---that behave as distinct,\nrigid disks. We show that the planet misaligns the inner disk even as the\norientation of the outer disk remains unchanged. In addition to the\noscillations induced by the precessional motion, whose amplitude is larger the\nsmaller the initial inner-disk-to-planet mass ratio, the spin--orbit angle also\nexhibits a secular growth in this case---driven by ongoing mass depletion from\nthe disk---that becomes significant when the inner disk's angular momentum\ndrops below that of the planet.

In order to constrain planet\nformation models using disk observations, it is crucial to find a robust way to\nquantitatively back out the properties of the gap-opening planets, in\nparticular their masses, from the observed gap properties, such as their depths\nand widths.

One of the proposed\nmigration scenarios is secular high-eccentricity or high-$e$ migration, in\nwhich the orbit of the planet is perturbed to high eccentricity by secular\nprocesses, triggering strong tidal evolution and orbital migration. Previous\ntheoretical studies have considered secular excitation in stellar binaries.\nRecently, a number of HJs have been observed in stellar triple systems. In the\nlatter, the secular dynamics are much richer compared to stellar binaries, and\nHJs could potentially be formed more efficiently. Here, we investigate this\npossibility by modeling the secular dynamical and tidal evolution of planets in\ntwo hierarchical configurations in stellar triple systems. We find that the HJ\nformation efficiency is higher compared to stellar binaries, but only by at\nmost a few tens of per cent. The orbital properties of the HJs formed in the\nsimulations are very similar to HJs formed in stellar binaries, and similarly\nto studies of the latter we find no significant number of warm Jupiters.

We illustrate\nthat a stable equilibrium of the averaged system (a periodic orbit of the\nN-body model) is surrounded by the region of permanent resonance capture, whose\nsize depends on the migration parameters and the planets mass ratio. A system\nlocated inside this region tends towards the equilibrium (the capture is\npermanent), while a system located outside the region evolves away from the\nequilibrium and leaves the resonance.

In particular, we focus on the\ntidal response of a rotating fluid body to the obliquity tide, which may be\nimportant for the evolution of the spin-orbit angle but hardly affects the\norbital evolution. The obliquity tide also provides a torque for the mutual\nprecession of the spin and orbital axes around the total angular momentum\nvector, which has not yet been considered in previous studies on the tidal\ninteractions. In this paper, we first formulate a set of linearized equations\ndescribing the tidal response in spin-orbit misaligned systems, taking into\naccount the precessional motion.

We found that the orbital parameters of TGPs\nin non-compact planetary systems are clearly shaped by tides raised by their\nhost stars. Indeed, the most eccentric planets have relatively large orbital\nseparations and/or high mass ratios, as expected from the equilibrium tide\ntheory. This feature would be the outcome of high-eccentricity migration (HEM).\nThe distribution of $\\alpha=a/a_R$, where $a$ and $a_R$ are the semi-major axis\nand the Roche limit, for well-determined circular orbits peaks at 2.5; this\nalso agrees with expectations from the HEM.

Traditionally, super-stellar elemental abundances in giant\nplanets were thought to be possible due to accretion of metal-rich solids. Such\nenrichments are accompanied by oxygen-rich compositions (i.e. C/O below the\ndisc's value, assumed to be solar, C/O=0.54). Without solid accretion the\nplanets are expected to have sub-solar metallicity, but high C/O ratios. This\narises because the solids are dominated by oxygen-rich species, e.g. H$_2$O and\nCO$_2$, which freeze out in the disk earlier than CO, leaving the gas metal\npoor but carbon-rich. Here we demonstrate that super-solar metallicities can be\nachieved by gas accretion alone when growth and radial drift of pebbles are\nconsidered in protoplanetary discs. Through this mechanism planets may\nsimultaneously acquire super-solar metallicities and super-solar C/O ratios.\nThis happens because the pebbles transport volatile species inward as they\nmigrate through the disc, enriching the gas at snow lines where the volatiles\nsublimate. Furthermore, the planet's composition can be used to constrain where\nit formed. Since high C/H and C/O ratios cannot be created by accreting solids,\nit may be possible to distinguish between formation via pebble accretion and\nplanetesimal accretion by the level of solid enrichment. Finally, we expect\nthat Jupiter's C/O ratio should be near or above solar if its enhanced carbon\nabundance came through accreting metal rich gas. Thus Juno's measurement of\nJupiter's C/O ratio should determine whether Jupiter accreted its metals from\ncarbon rich gas or oxygen rich solids. \n\n"}

We\ninvestigate the effect of the initial eccentricities and inclinations of\nprotoplanets on the formation of close-in super-Earths. We perform $N$-body\nsimulations of protoplanets in gas-free disks, changing the initial\neccentricities and inclinations systematically. We find that while the\neccentricities of protoplanets are well relaxed through their evolution, the\ninclinations are not. When the initial inclinations are small, they are not\ngenerally pumped up since scattering is less effective and collisions occur\nimmediately after orbital crossing. On the other hand, when the initial\ninclinations are large, they tend to be kept large since collisional damping is\nless effective. Not only the resultant inclinations of planets, but also their\nnumber, eccentricities, angular momentum deficit, and orbital separations are\naffected by the initial inclinations of protoplanets. \n\n"}

Effect of stellar\n  metallicity Abstract: Observations of hot Jupiter type exoplanets suggest that their orbital period\ndistribution depends on the metallicity of their host star. We investigate here\nwhether the impact of the stellar metallicity on the evolution of the tidal\ndissipation inside the convective envelope of rotating stars and its resulting\neffect on the planetary migration might be a possible explanation for this\nobserved statistical trend.\n  We use a frequency-averaged tidal dissipation formalism coupled to an orbital\nevolution code and to rotating stellar evolution models to estimate the effect\nof a change of stellar metallicity on the evolution of close-in planets. We\nconsider here two different stellar masses: 0.4 and 1.0 $M_{\\odot}$ evolving\nfrom the early pre-main sequence phase up to the red giant branch.\n  We show that the metallicity of a star has a strong effect on the stellar\nparameters which in turn strongly influence the tidal dissipation in the\nconvective region. While on the pre-main sequence the dissipation of a metal\npoor Sun-like star is higher than the dissipation of a metal rich Sun-like\nstar, on the main sequence it is the opposite. However, for the $0.4~M_{\\odot}$\nstar, the dependence of the dissipation with metallicity is much less visible.\n  Using an orbital evolution model, we show that changing the metallicity leads\nto different orbital evolutions (e.g., planets migrate farther out from an\ninitially fast rotating metal rich star). By using this model, we qualitatively\nreproduced the observational trends of the population of hot Jupiters with the\nmetallicity of their host stars. However, more steps are needed to improve our\nmodel to try to quantitatively fit our results to the observations.

The combination of the latter two effects is the\nprimary reason for Jupiter's main auroral ovals. Jupiter's moon Ganymede is the\nonly known moon with an intrinsic dynamo magnetic field, which generates a\nmini-magnetosphere located within Jupiter's larger magnetosphere including two\nauroral ovals. Ganymede's magnetosphere is qualitatively different compared to\nthe one from Jupiter. It possesses no bow shock but develops Alfv\\'en wings\nsimilar to most of the extrasolar planets which orbit their host stars within\n0.1 AU. New numerical models of Jupiter's and Ganymede's magnetospheres\npresented here provide quantitative insight into the processes that maintain\nthese magnetospheres.

This is mainly because\nabsolute stellar ages for older stars are hard to measure. However, relatively\naccurate stellar ages have recently come into reach through asteroseismology.\nIn this work we present X-ray luminosities, which are a measure for magnetic\nactivity displayed by the stellar coronae, for 24 stars with well-determined\nages older than a gigayear. We find 14 stars with detectable X-ray luminosities\nand use these to calibrate the age-activity relationship.

A major driver of steady-state plate tectonics on Earth is the\nsinking of the cold subducting plate into the underlying mantle. This sinking\nis the result of the combined effects of the thermal contraction of the\nlithosphere and of metamorphic transitions within the basaltic oceanic crust\nand lithospheric mantle. The latter of these effects is dependent on the bulk\ncomposition of the planet, e.g., the major, terrestrial planet-building\nelements Mg, Si, Fe, Ca, Al, and Na, which vary in abundance across the Galaxy.\nWe present thermodynamic phase-equilibria calculations of planetary\ndifferentiation to calculate both melt composition and mantle mineralogy, and\nshow that a planet's refractory and moderately-volatile elemental abundances\ncontrol a terrestrial planet's likelihood to produce mantle-derived,\nmelt-extracted crusts that sink.

This has implications for the time evolution of tidally active\nworlds, and the long-term equilibria they fall into.

For three of the new cases spectroscopic\nmeasurements of the candidates' host stars were retrieved from the ESO Science\nArchive Facility and used to calculate stellar parameters and, in the best\ncases, radial velocities.

Often, a constraint on the Einstein\nring radius measurement is obtained from the caustic crossing time: This is\nsupplemented by secondary constraints such as precise parallax measurements\nand/or measures of the lens luminosity using high angular resolution\nobservations. We resolved the source+lens star from sub-arcsecond blends in H\nband using adaptive optics (AO) observations with NIRC2 mounted on Keck II\ntelescope.

We estimate the potential contributions to this blended light\n(chance-aligned star, additional companion to the lens or to the source) and\nfind that 85 % of of the NIR flux is due to the lens star at H_L=16.63 +- 0.06\nand K_L=16.46 +- 0.06.

We investigate whether such structures are due to the\nmorphology of the disk itself or if they are instead an intrinsic feature of CN\nemission. With the intention of using CN as a diagnostic, we also address to\nwhich physical and chemical parameters CN is most sensitive. A set of disk\nmodels were run for different stellar spectra, masses, and physical structures\nvia the 2D thermochemical code DALI. An updated chemical network that accounts\nfor the most relevant CN reactions was adopted. Ring-shaped emission is found\nto be a common feature of all adopted models; the highest abundance is found in\nthe upper outer regions of the disk, and the column density peaks at 30-100 AU\nfor T Tauri stars with standard accretion rates. Higher mass disks generally\nshow brighter CN. Higher UV fields, such as those appropriate for T Tauri stars\nwith high accretion rates or for Herbig Ae stars or for higher disk flaring,\ngenerally result in brighter and larger rings. These trends are due to the main\nformation paths of CN, which all start with vibrationally excited H2*\nmolecules, that are produced through far ultraviolet (FUV) pumping of H2. The\nmodel results compare well with observed disk-integrated CN fluxes and the\nobserved location of the CN ring for the TW Hya disk. CN rings are produced\nnaturally in protoplanetary disks and do not require a specific underlying disk\nstructure such as a dust cavity or gap. The strong link between FUV flux and CN\nemission can provide critical information regarding the vertical structure of\nthe disk and the distribution of dust grains which affects the UV penetration,\nand could help to break some degeneracies in the SED fitting.

To study the dynamical evolution of the system, we\nsimulate the motions of Proxima and alpha Centauri A and B due to the\nperturbations from the Galactic tide and stellar encounters in a Monte Carlo\nfashion. From 100 clones, we find that 74% orbits of Proxima Centauri are bound\nto alpha Centauri A and B while 17% and 9% orbits become unbound in the\nsimulations over the past and future 5 Gyr. If the system migrated outward in\nthe Milky Way to its current location, more than 50% of clones could become\nunstable in backward simulations. The ratio of unstable clones increases with\nthe simulation time scale and encounter rate. This provides some evidence for a\ncapture scenario for the formation of the current triple system.

This in\nturn affects planet formation. Recently, the effect of disk wind torque has\nbeen considered with the suggestion that it would carve out the surface density\nof the disk from inside and would induce global gas flows (wind-driven\naccretion). We aim to investigate effects of global gas flows on type I\nmigration and also examine planet formation. A simplified approach was taken to\naddress this issue, and N-body simulations with isolation-mass planets were\nalso performed. In previous studies, the effect of gas flow induced by\nturbulence-driven accretion has been taken into account for its desaturation\neffect of the corotation torque. If more rapid gas flows (e.g., wind-driven\naccretion) are considered, the desaturation effect can be modified. In\nMRI-inactive disks, in which the wind-driven accretion dominates the disk\nevolution, the gas flow at the midplane plays an important role. If this flow\nis fast, the corotation torque is efficiently desaturated. Then, the fact that\nthe surface density slope can be positive in the inner region due to the wind\ntorque can generate an outward migration region extended to super-Earth mass\nplanets. In this case, we observe that no planets fall onto the central star in\nN-body simulations with migration forces imposed to reproduce such migration\npattern.

If these discs are prone to\nfragmentation, then they are able to rapidly form objects that are initially of\nseveral Jupiter masses and larger. The fate of these disc fragments (and the\nfate of planetary bodies formed afterwards via core accretion) depends\nsensitively not only on the fragment's interaction with the disc, but with its\nneighbouring fragments.\n  We return to and revise our population synthesis model of self-gravitating\ndisc fragmentation and tidal downsizing. Amongst other improvements, the model\nnow directly incorporates fragment-fragment interactions while the disc is\nstill present. We find that fragment-fragment scattering dominates the orbital\nevolution, even when we enforce rapid migration and inefficient gap formation.\n  Compared to our previous model, we see a small increase in the number of\nterrestrial-type objects being formed, although their survival under tidal\nevolution is at best unclear.

After\ncorrecting for survey incompleteness, we measure planet occurrence: the number\nof planets per 100 stars with a given metallicity $M$. Planet occurrence\ncorrelates with metallicity for some, but not all, planet sizes and orbital\nperiods. For warm super-Earths having $P = 10-100$ days and $R_P =\n1.0-1.7~R_E$, planet occurrence is nearly constant over metallicities spanning\n$-$0.4 dex to +0.4 dex.

In contrast, the occurrence of warm sub-Neptunes ($R_P =\n1.7-4.0~R_E$) doubles over that same metallicity interval, from 20 to 40\nplanets per 100 stars.

By combining the observed astrometry from the\nimaging data with 27 years of radial velocities, we use orbital fitting to\nconstrain its orbital and physical parameters, as well as update those of the\nplanet HD4113Ab, discovered by previous radial velocity measurements. The data\nsuggest a dynamical mass of $66\\pm5$M$_J$ and moderate eccentricity of\n$0.44\\pm0.08$ for the brown dwarf. This mass estimate appears to conflict with\nthe isochronal estimate and that of similar objects, which may be caused by the\nnewly detected object being an unresolved binary brown dwarf system or the\npresence of an additional object in the system. Through dynamical simulations\nwe show that the planet may undergo strong Lidov-Kozai cycles, raising the\npossibility that it formed on a quasi-circular orbit and gained its currently\nobserved high eccentricity through interactions with the brown dwarf. Follow-up\nobservations combining radial velocities, direct imaging and Gaia astrometry\nwill be crucial to precisely constrain the dynamical mass of the brown dwarf\nand allow for in-depth comparison with evolutionary and atmospheric models. \n\n"}

The system is of\nastrobiological interest, because three of its planets orbit in the habitable\nzone of the ultracool M dwarf. Assuming the planets are composed of\nnon-compressible iron, rock, and H$_2$O, we determine possible interior\nstructures for each planet. To determine how much tidal heat may be dissipated\nwithin each planet, we construct a tidal heat generation model using a single\nuniform viscosity and rigidity for each planet based on the planet's\ncomposition. With the exception of TRAPPIST-1c, all seven of the planets have\ndensities low enough to indicate the presence of significant H$_2$O in some\nform. Planets b and c experience enough heating from planetary tides to\nmaintain magma oceans in their rock mantles; planet c may have eruptions of\nsilicate magma on its surface, which may be detectable with next-generation\ninstrumentation.

Despite this common\nsource, the latitudinal distribution of the two species is radically different,\nwith acetylene decreasing in abundance towards the pole, and ethane increasing\ntowards the pole. We present six years of NASA IRTF TEXES mid-infrared\nobservations of the zonally-averaged emission of methane, acetylene and ethane.\nWe confirm that the latitudinal distributions of ethane and acetylene are\ndecoupled, and that this is a persistent feature over multiple years. The\nacetylene distribution falls off towards the pole, peaking at\n$\\sim$30$^{\\circ}$N with a volume mixing ratio (VMR) of $\\sim$0.8 parts per\nmillion (ppm) at 1 mbar and still falling off at $\\pm70^\\circ$ with a VMR of\n$\\sim$0.3 ppm. The acetylene distributions are asymmetric on average, but as we\nmove from 2013 to 2017, the zonally-averaged abundance becomes more symmetric\nabout the equator. We suggest that both the short term changes in acetylene and\nits latitudinal asymmetry is driven by changes to the vertical stratospheric\nmixing, potentially related to propagating wave phenomena.

Many of them relate to its\nlack of cometary activity, suggesting refractory composition of 'Oumuamua. Here\nwe explore the possibility that 'Oumuamua-like ISAs are produced in tidal\ndisruption events (TDEs) of refractory planetoids (asteroids, dwarf planets,\netc.) by the white dwarfs (WDs). This idea is supported by existing\nspectroscopic observations of metal-polluted WDs, hinting at predominantly\nvolatile-poor composition of accreted material. We show that such TDEs sourced\nby realistic planetary systems (including a population of >1000 km planetoids\nand massive perturbers - Neptune-to-Saturn mass planets) can eject to\ninterstellar space up to 30% of planetary mass involved in them. Collisional\nfragmentation, caused by convergent vertical motion of the disrupted\nplanetoid's debris inside the Roche sphere of the WD, channels most of the\noriginal mass into 0.1-1 km fragments, similar to 'Oumuamua. Such size spectrum\nof ISAs (very different from the top-heavy distributions expected in other\nscenarios) implies that planetary TDEs can account for a significant fraction\n(up to ~30% under optimistic assumptions) of the ISAs. This figure is based on\nexisting observations of WD metal pollution and accounts for observational\nbiases by using realistic models of circum-WD planetary systems. ISAs should\nexhibit kinematic characteristics similar to old, dynamically hot Galactic\npopulations; we interpret 'Oumuamua's slow Galactic motion as a statistical\nfluctuation. ISA ejection in individual planetary TDEs is highly anisotropic,\nresulting in large fluctuations of their space density.

These planets are vulnerable to atmospheric\nmass loss due to heating by the parent star's XUV flux. Models coupling\natmospheric mass loss with thermal evolution predicted a bimodal distribution\nof planetary radii, which has gained observational support. However, a key\ncomponent that has been ignored in previous studies is the dissolution of these\ngases into the molten core of rock and iron that constitute most of their mass.\nSuch planets have high temperatures ($>$2000 K) and pressures ($\\sim$kbars) at\nthe core-envelope boundary, ensuring a molten surface and a subsurface\nreservoir of hydrogen that can be 5-10 times larger than the atmosphere. This\nstudy bridges this gap by coupling the thermal evolution of the planet and the\nmass loss of the atmosphere with the thermodynamic equilibrium between the\ndissolved H$_2$ and the atmospheric H$_2$ (Henry's law). Dissolution in the\ninterior allows a planet to build a larger hydrogen repository during the\nplanet formation stage. We show that the dissolved hydrogen outgasses to buffer\natmospheric mass loss. The slow cooling of the planet also leads to outgassing\nbecause solubility decreases with decreasing temperature. Dissolution of\nhydrogen in the interior therefore increases the atmosphere retention ability\nof super-Earths. The study highlights the importance of including the\ntemperature- and pressure-dependent solubility of gases in magma oceans and\ncoupling outgassing to planetary evolution models. \n\n"}

This\nneglect is unwarranted given that any strong vertical motions associated with\nthese waves could profoundly impact dust dynamics, dust sedimentation, planet\nformation, and the emissivity of the disc surface. In this paper we combine\nlinear calculations and shearing box simulations in order to investigate the\nvertical structure of spiral waves for various polytropic stratifications and\nwave amplitudes.

They are also intimately connected to the\ndisk's g-modes which appear to interact nonlinearly with the density waves.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that the poloidal rolls are ubiquitous in\ngravitoturbulence, emerging in the vicinity of GI spiral wakes, and potentially\ntransporting grains off the disk midplane. Other than hindering sedimentation\nand planet formation, this phenomena may bear on observations of the disk's\nscattered infrared luminosity.

We present new VLT/SPHERE\nIRDIS Dual-Polarization Imaging (DPI) observations in which we detect the dust\nring around the M2 spectral type star TWA\\,7. Combined with additional Angular\nDifferential Imaging observations we aim at a fine characterization of the\ndebris disk and setting constraints on the presence of low-mass planets.

We find that the dust density distribution peaks at 25 au, with a\nvery shallow outer power-law slope, and that the disk has an inclination of 13\ndegrees with a position angle of 90 degrees East of North. We also report low\nsignal-to-noise detections of an outer belt at a distance of ~52 au from the\nstar, of a spiral arm in the Southern side of the star, and of a possible dusty\nclump at 3.9 au. These findings seem to persist over timescales of at least a\nyear. Using the intensity images, we do not detect any planets in the close\nvicinity of the star, but the sensitivity reaches Jovian planet mass upper\nlimits.

We\nanalyse the performance of four different indicators and the chromospheric\nindex $\\log R'_{\\rm HK}$ in detecting RV variations induced by stellar activity\nin 15 slowly rotating ($v\\sin i \\leq 5$ km/s), weakly active ($\\log R'_{\\rm HK}\n\\leq -4.95$) solar-like stars observed with the high-resolution spectrograph\nHARPS-N. We consider indicators of the asymmetry of the cross-correlation\nfunction (CCF) between the stellar spectrum and the binary weighted line mask\nused to compute the RV, that is the bisector inverse span (BIS), $\\Delta V$,\nand a new indicator $V_{\\rm asy(mod)}$ together with the full width at half\nmaximum (FWHM) of the CCF. We present methods to evaluate the uncertainties of\nthe CCF indicators and apply a kernel regression (KR) between the RV, the time,\nand each of the indicators to study their capability of reproducing the RV\nvariations induced by stellar activity. The considered indicators together with\nthe KR prove to be useful to detect activity-induced RV variations in $47 \\pm\n18$ percent of the stars over a two-year time span when a significance\n(two-sided p-value) threshold of one percent is adopted. In those cases, KR\nreduces the standard deviation of the RV time series by a factor of\napproximately two. The BIS, the FWHM, and the newly introduced $V_{\\rm\nasy(mod)}$ are the best indicators, being useful in $27 \\pm 13$, $13 \\pm 9$,\nand $13 \\pm 9$ percent of the cases, respectively. The relatively limited\nperformances of the activity indicators are related to the very low activity\nlevel and $v\\sin i$ of the considered stars.

Deriving accurate exoplanetary radii requires\naccurate measurements of the host star radii and the planetary transit depths,\nincluding accounting for any \"third light\" in the system due to nearby bound\ncompanions or background stars. High-resolution imaging of Kepler and K2 planet\ncandidate hosts to detect very close (within ~0.5\") background or bound stellar\ncompanions has been crucial for both confirming the planetary nature of\ncandidates, and the determination of accurate planetary radii and mean\ndensities. Here we present an investigation of the effect of close companions,\nboth detected and undetected, on the observed (raw count) exoplanet radius\ndistribution. We demonstrate that the recently detected \"gap\" in the observed\nradius distribution (also seen in the completeness-corrected distribution) is\nfairly robust to undetected stellar companions, given that all of the systems\nin the sample have undergone some kind of vetting with high-resolution imaging.\nHowever, while the gap in the observed sample is not erased or shifted, it is\npartially filled in after accounting for possible undetected stellar\ncompanions. These findings have implications for the most likely core\ncomposition, and thus formation location, of super-Earth and sub-Neptune\nplanets. Furthermore, we show that without high-resolution imaging of planet\ncandidate host stars, the shape of the observed exoplanet radius distribution\nwill be incorrectly inferred, for both Kepler- and TESS-detected systems. \n\n"}

The fact that the orbit of a distant SSO is\napproximately linear in heliocentric coordinates over long time-scales can be\nutilized to produce candidates, which can then be confirmed with follow-up\nobservations.

We apply this\nmethodology to the Kepler-138 planetary system. The derived planetary bulk\ndensities are a factor of 2 more precise than previous determinations, and we\nfind a discrepancy in the stellar bulk density with respect to a previous\nstudy. This leads, in turn, to a discrepancy in the determination of masses and\nradii of the star and the planets. In particular, we find that interior planet,\nKepler-138b, has a size in between Mars and the Earth. Given our mass and\ndensity estimates, we characterize the planetary interiors using a generalized\nBayesian inference model. This model allows us to quantify for interior\ndegeneracy and calculate confidence regions of interior parameters such as\nthicknesses of the core, the mantle, and ocean and gas layers. We find that\nKepler-138b and Kepler-138d have significantly thick volatile layers and that\nthe gas layer of Kepler-138b is likely enriched. On the other hand, Kepler-138c\ncan be purely rocky. \n\n"}

In the multiple-impact hypothesis of lunar formation,\nthe current Moon was produced from the mergers of several smaller satellites\n(moonlets), each formed from debris disks produced by successive large impacts.\nIn the Myrs between impacts, a pre-existing moonlet tidally evolves outward\nuntil a subsequent impact forms a new moonlet, at which point both moonlets\nwill tidally evolve until a merger or system disruption. In this work, we\nexamine the likelihood that pre-existing moonlets survive subsequent impact\nevents, and explore the dynamics of Earth-moonlet systems that contain two\nmoonlets generated Myrs apart. We demonstrate that pre-existing moonlets can\ntidally migrate outward, remain stable during subsequent impacts, and later\nmerge with newly created moonlets (or re-collide with the Earth). Formation of\nthe Moon from the mergers of several moonlets could therefore be a natural\nbyproduct of the Earth's growth through multiple impacts. More generally, we\nexamine the likelihood and consequences of Earth having prior moons, and find\nthat the stability of moonlets against disruption by subsequent impacts implies\nthat several large impacts could post-date Moon formation. \n\n"}

Although currently not detected, exomoons could be orbiting some of\nthese CBPs, and they might be suitable for harboring life. A necessary\ncondition for the existence of such exomoons is their long-term dynamical\nstability. Here, we investigate the stability of exomoons around the Kepler\nCBPs using numerical $N$-body integrations. We determine regions of stability\nand obtain stability maps in the (a_m,i_pm) plane, where a_m is the initial\nexolunar semimajor axis with respect to the CBP, and i_pm is the initial\ninclination of the orbit of the exomoon around the planet with respect to the\norbit of the planet around the stellar binary. Ignoring any dependence on i_pm,\nfor most Kepler CBPs the stability regions are well described by the location\nof the 1:1 mean motion commensurability of the binary orbit with the orbit of\nthe moon around the CBP. This is related to a destabilizing effect of the\nbinary compared to the case if the binary were replaced by a single body, and\nwhich is borne out by corresponding 3-body integrations. For high inclinations,\nthe evolution is dominated by Lidov-Kozai oscillations, which can bring moons\nin dynamically stable orbits to close proximity within the CBP, triggering\nstrong interactions such as tidal evolution, tidal disruption, or direct\ncollisions. This suggests that there is a dearth of highly-inclined exomoons\naround the Kepler CBPs, whereas coplanar exomoons are dynamically allowed. \n\n"}

We combine observations and\nchemical models to constrain the sulfur abundances and their sensitivity to\nphysical and chemical conditions in the DM Tau protoplanetary disk. Methods. We\nobtained $0.5^{\"}$ ALMA observations of DM Tau in Bands 4 and 6 in lines of CS,\nSO, SO$_2$, OCS, CCS, H$_2$CS and H$_2$S, achieving a $\\sim 5$ mJy sensitivity.\nUsing the non-LTE radiative transfer code RADEX and the forward-modeling tool\nDiskFit, disk-averaged CS column densities and upper limits for the other\nspecies were derived.

The upper limits range between $\\sim 10^{11}$\nand $10^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$ for the other S-bearing species. The best-fit chemical\nmodel matching these values requires a gas-phase C/O ratio of > 1 at $r \\sim\n50-100$ au. With chemical modeling we demonstrate that sulfur-bearing species\ncould be robust tracers of the gas-phase C/O ratio, surface reaction rates,\ngrain size and UV intensities. Conclusions. The lack of detections of a variety\nof sulfur-bearing molecules in DM Tau other than CS implies a dearth of\nreactive sulfur in the gas phase, either through efficient freeze-out or\nbecause most of the elemental sulfur is in other large species, as found in\ncomets.

The stronger depletion of oxygen-bearing S-species compared to\nCS is likely linked to the low observed abundances of gaseous water in DM Tau\nand points to a removal mechanism of oxygen from the gas. \n\n"}

Therefore, we assess the\nperformance of several MCMC samplers that use varying degrees of geometric\ninformation about the target distribution. We generate synthetic datasets from\nmultiple models, including the TTVFaster model and a simple sinusoidal model,\nand test the efficiencies of various MCMC samplers. We find that sampling\nefficiency can be greatly improved for all models by sampling from a parameter\nspace transformed using an estimate of the covariance and means of the target\ndistribution. No one sampler performs the best for all datasets, but several\nsamplers, such as Differential Evolution Monte Carlo and Geometric adaptive\nMonte Carlo, have consistently efficient performance. For datasets with near\nGaussian posteriors, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo samplers with 2 or 3 leapfrog\nsteps obtained the highest efficiencies. Based on differences in effective\nsample sizes per time, we show that the right choice of sampler can improve\nsampling efficiencies by several orders of magnitude. \n\n"}

The resulting planetary distribution is\ncompared with the observed population of extrasolar planets, and the model\nparameters are improved iteratively using a particle swarm optimization scheme.\nThe characteristics of the final planetary systems are mainly controlled by the\npebble isolation mass, which is the mass of a planet that perturbs nearby gas\nenough to halt the inward flux of drifting pebbles and stop growth. The pebble\nisolation mass increases with orbital distance so that giant planet cores can\nonly form in the outer disk. Giants migrate inwards, populating a wide range of\nfinal orbital distances.

However, within the exoplanet direct\nimaging community, non-detections have almost exclusively been defined using a\nfrequentist detection threshold (i.e. contrast curve) and associated\ncompleteness. This can lead to conceptual inconsistencies when included in a\nBayesian framework. A Bayesian upper limit is such that the true value of a\nparameter lies below this limit with a certain probability. The associated\nprobability is the integral of the posterior distribution with the upper limit\nas the upper bound. In summary, a frequentist upper limit is a statement about\nthe detectability of planets while a Bayesian upper limit is a statement about\nthe probability of a parameter to lie in an interval given the data. The latter\nis therefore better suited for rejecting hypotheses or theoretical models based\non their predictions.

Here\nwe extend these 2D simulations to three dimensions (3D) and find that rings and\ngaps are still formed in the presence of a moderately strong ambipolar\ndiffusion. The rings and gaps form from the same basic mechanism that was\nidentified in the 2D simulations, namely, the redistribution of the poloidal\nmagnetic flux relative to the disk material as a result of the reconnection of\na sharply pinched poloidal magnetic field lines. Thus, the less dense gaps are\nmore strongly magnetized with a large poloidal magnetic field compared to the\nless magnetized (dense) rings. The rings and gaps start out rather smoothly in\n3D simulations that have axisymmetric initial conditions. Non-axisymmetric\nvariations arise spontaneously at later times, but they do not grow to such an\nextent as to disrupt the rings and gaps. These disk substructures persist to\nthe end of the simulations, lasting up to 3000 orbital periods at the inner\nedge of the simulated disk. The longevity of the perturbed yet still coherent\nrings make them attractive sites for trapping large grains that would otherwise\nbe lost to rapid radial migration due to gas drag. As the ambipolar diffusivity\ndecreases, both the disk and the wind become increasingly turbulent, driven by\nthe magnetorotational instability, with tightly-wound spiral arms becoming more\nprominent in the disk. \n\n"}

Here, instead,\nI derive user-friendly formulae from first principles independent of viewpoint\nand in three dimensions. I generalise the results of Veras & Breedt (2017) by\n(i) characterising three-body systems which are in transit but are not\nnecessarily perfectly aligned, and by (ii) incorporating motion. For a given\nsnapshot in time, I derive explicit criteria to determine whether a system is\nin or out of transit, if an eclipse is total or annular, and expressions for\nthe size of the shadow, including their extreme values and a condition for\nengulfment. These results are exact. For orbital motion, I instead obtain\napproximate results. By assuming fixed orbits, I derive a single implicit\nalgebraic relation which can be solved to obtain the frequency and duration of\ntransit events -- including ingresses and egresses -- for combinations of\nmoons, planets and stars on arbitrarily inclined circular orbits; the eccentric\ncase requires the solution of Kepler's equation but remains algebraic.

HIP 79124 is a member of the\nScorpius-Centaurus association, consisting of an A0V primary with two low-mass\ncompanions at a projected separation of <1 arcsecond. Thanks to the high\nquality wavefront corrections provided by SCExAO, both companions are\ndecisively detected without the employment of any PSF-subtraction algorithm to\neliminate quasi-static noise. The spectrum of the outer C object is very well\nmatched by Upper Scorpius M4 pm 0.5 standard spectra, with a Teff = 2945 pm 100\nand a mass of 350 MJup.

Previous studies of stellar\npopulations in Sco-Cen have highlighted a discrepancy in isochronal ages\nbetween the lower-mass and higher-mass populations.

These results imply that the omission of\nmagnetic effects in conventional isochronal models inhibit them from\nreproducing early low-mass stellar evolution, which is further supported by the\nfact that new models that include such effects provide more consistent ages in\nthe HIP 79124 system. \n\n"}

We investigate the\ndetectability of tidal deformation in short-period planets from their transit\nlight curves and the instrumental precision needed.

Using this dynamical\nconstraint, we derive the maximum size of grains that survive in the ISM for\ndifferent dust models, including contact binary, composite, silicate-core, and\namorphous carbon mantle, and compact grain model for the different radiation\nfields.

One known problem, for instance, is the\nnon-fully regular block-stitching of the CCDs, which introduces, in some cases,\none-year period parasitic signals in the measured radial velocity.\n  The aim is to improve the wavelength calibration of HARPS to push further its\nplanet-detection capabilities.\n  The properties of the CCD stitching-induced pixel-size anomalies are\ndetermined with LED flat-field frames, and then a physical, gap-corrected map\nof the CCDs is used for the fitting model of the spectral orders. We also use a\nnew thorium line list, based on much higher-accuracy measurements than the one\nused up to now. We derive new wavelength solutions for the 15 years of HARPS\ndata, both before and after the 2015 fibre upgrade.\n  We demonstrate that we correct the gap anomalies by computing the wavelength\nsolutions of laser frequency comb exposures, both with and without taking the\ngap correction into account.

In this paper we\ninvestigate one such mechanism involving \"secular chaos\", in which secular\ninteractions between at least three giant planets push the inner planet to a\nhighly eccentric orbit, followed by tidal circularization and orbital decay. In\naddition to the equilibrium tidal friction, we incorporate dissipation due to\ndynamical tides that are excited inside the giant planet. Using the method of\nGaussian rings to account for planet-planet interactions, we explore the\nconditions for extreme eccentricity excitation via secular chaos and the\nproperties of hot Jupiters formed in this migration channel. Our calculations\nshow that once the inner planet reaches a sufficiently large eccentricity,\ndynamical tides quickly dissipate the orbital energy, producing an eccentric\nwarm Jupiter, which then decays in semi-major axis through equilibrium tides to\nbecome a hot Jupiter. Dynamical tides help the planet avoid tidal disruption,\nincreasing the chance of forming a hot Jupiter, although not all planets\nsurvive the process. We find that the final orbital periods generally lie in\nthe range of 2-3 days, somewhat shorter than those of the observed hot Jupiter\npopulation. We couple the planet migration to the stellar spin evolution to\npredict the final spin-orbit misalignments.

HD 169142 is a very young Herbig Ae-Be\nstar surrounded by a pre-transitional disk, composed of at least three rings.\nWhile claims of sub-stellar objects around this star have been made previously,\nfollow-up studies remain inconclusive. We used SPHERE at ESO VLT to obtain a\nsequence of high-contrast images of the immediate surroundings of this star\nover about three years.

While we were unable to definitively confirm the\nprevious claims of a massive sub-stellar object at 0.1-0.15 arcsec from the\nstar, we found both spirals and blobs within the disk. The spiral pattern may\nbe explained as due to the presence of a primary, a secondary, and a tertiary\narm excited by a planet of a few Jupiter masses lying along the primary arm,\nlikely in the cavities between the rings. The blobs orbit the star consistently\nwith Keplerian motion, allowing a dynamical determination of the mass of the\nstar. While most of these blobs are located within the rings, we found that one\nof them lies in the cavity between the rings, along the primary arm of the\nspiral design.

The\nrecent discovery of global-scale equatorial Rossby waves in the Sun, also\ncalled r modes, prompted us to investigate their possible signature in stellar\nRV measurements. R modes are toroidal modes of oscillation whose restoring\nforce is the Coriolis force and propagate in the retrograde direction in a\nframe that corotates with the star. The solar r modes with azimuthal orders $3\n\\leq m \\lesssim 15$ were identified unambiguously because of their dispersion\nrelation and their long e-folding lifetimes of hundreds of days.

That is to\nsay, the effects of gravity may be completely scaled away and the circulation\nis unaltered. However, if the atmosphere contains a dilute condensible that is\nradiatively active, such as water or methane, then an increase in gravity will\ngenerally lead to a cooling of the planet because the total path length of the\ncondensible will be reduced as gravity increases, leading to a reduction in the\ngreenhouse effect.

Follow-up imaging and spectroscopy reveals that\nsome of the knots are associated with previously uncataloged dwarf galaxies\n(M_B = -15.8 to -16.5), while others appear to be isolated HII galaxies or\nintergalactic HII regions. Radial velocities obtained for several of the knots\nshow that they are physically associated with a small group or subcluster\nincluding CGCG 97-114 and CGCG 97-125. No comparable concentration of\nemission-line objects has been found elsewhere in any of the eight northern\nAbell clusters surveyed to date. The strong H-alpha emission in the objects and\ntheir high spatial density argue against this being a group of normal,\nunperturbed dwarf galaxies.

We consider\nnon-axisymmetric linear perturbations to an isentropic, isothermal,\nunmagnetized thin accretion disk. The radial wave equation, in which the number\nof vertical nodes (n) appears as a separation constant, admits a wave-action\ncurrent that is conserved except, in some cases, at corotation. Waves without\nvertical nodes amplify when reflected by a barrier near corotation. Their\naction is conserved. As was previously known, this amplification allows the n=0\nmodes to be unstable under appropriate boundary conditions. In contrast, we\nfind that waves with n >0 are strongly absorbed at corotation rather than\namplified; their action is not conserved. Therefore, non-axisymmetric p-modes\nand g-modes with n>0 are damped and stable even in an inviscid disk.

The\nspectrum is marked by a sharp drop in flux at 0.7 keV which has been\ninterpreted by Branduardi-Raymont et al. as the blue wing of a relativistic\nOVIII emission line and by Lee at al. as a dusty warm absorber. We find that\nthe drop is well explained by the FeI L2,3 absorption edges and obtain\nreasonable fits over the 0.32-1.7 keV band using a multizone, dusty warm\nabsorber model. Some residuals remain which could be due to emission from a\nrelativistic disc, but at a much weaker level than from any model relying on\nrelativistic emission lines alone.

We focus on bound matter inside the initial pressure maximum, where the\ntime-averaged motion of gas is inward and an accretion disk forms. We use the\nflows of mass, angular momentum, and energy in order to understand dynamics in\nthis region. The sharp reduction in accretion rate with increasing black hole\nspin reported in Paper I of this series is explained by a strongly\nspin-dependent outward flux of angular momentum conveyed electromagnetically;\nwhen a/M > 0.9, this flux can be comparable to the inward angular momentum flux\ncarried by the matter. In all cases, there is outward electromagnetic angular\nmomentum flux throughout the flow; in other words, contrary to the assertions\nof traditional accretion disk theory, there is in general no \"stress edge\", no\nsurface within which the stress is zero. The retardation of accretion in the\ninner disk by electromagnetic torques also alters the radial distribution of\nsurface density, an effect that may have consequences for observable properties\nsuch as Compton reflection. The net accreted angular momentum is sufficiently\ndepressed by electromagnetic effects that in the most rapidly-spinning black\nholes mass growth can lead to spindown. Spinning black holes also lose energy\nby Poynting flux; this rate is also a strongly increasing function of black\nhole spin, rising to 10% or more of the rest-mass accretion rate at very high\nspin. As the black hole spins faster, the path of the Poynting flux changes\nfrom being predominantly within the accretion disk to predominantly within the\nfunnel outflow. \n\n"}

The method follows the electron\npopulation in sufficient detail to allow computation of synthetic radio and\nX-ray observations of the simulated sources, including spectral properties (see\nthe companion paper by Tregillis et al. 1999). The cosmic-ray particle\nsimulations can follow the effects of shock acceleration, second-order Fermi\nacceleration as well as radiative and adiabatic energy losses. We have applied\nthis scheme to 2-D and 3-D MHD simulations of jet-driven flows and have begun\nto explore links between dynamics and the properties of high energy electron\npopulations in radio lobes. The key initial discovery is the great importance\nto the high energy particle population of the very unsteady and inhomogeneous\nflows, especially near the end of the jet. Because of this, in particular, our\nsimulations show that a large fraction of the particle population flowing from\nthe jet into the cocoon never passes through strong shocks. The shock strengths\nencountered are not simply predicted by 1-D models, and are quite varied.\nConsequently, the emergent electron spectra are highly heterogeneous. Rates of\nsynchrotron aging in \"hot-spots\" seem similarly to be very uneven, enhancing\ncomplexity in the spectral properties of electrons as they emerge into the\nlobes and making more difficult the task of comparing dynamical and radiative\nages. \n\n"}

The post-inflationary evolution of the universe in this\nscenario is generically characterised by a `kinetic regime' during which the\nkinetic energy of the scalar field greatly exceeds its potential energy\nresulting in a `stiff' equation of state for scalar field matter $P_\\phi \\simeq\n\\rho_\\phi$. The kinetic regime precedes the radiation dominated epoch and\nintroduces an important new feature into the spectrum of relic gravity waves\ncreated quantum mechanically during inflation. The gravity wave spectrum\nincreases with wavenumber for wavelengths shorter than the comoving horizon\nscale at the commencement of the radiative regime. This `blue tilt' is a\ngeneric feature of models with steep potentials and imposes strong constraints\non a class of inflationary braneworld models.

The bounces we consider normally would be\nexpected to require an energy density which violates the weak energy condition,\nand for our co-dimension one examples this is attributable to bulk curvature\nterms in the effective Friedmann equation.
