In particular, using a fully covariant\nrelativistic transport approach, we see that the density dependence of the {\\it\ninelastic} cross sections appreciably affects the pion and kaon yields and\ntheir rapidity distributions. However, the $(\\pi^{-}/\\pi^{+})$- and\n$(K^{0}/K^{+})$-ratios depend only moderately on the in-medium behavior of the\ninelastic cross sections. This is particularly true for kaon yield ratios,\nsince kaons are more uniformly produced in high density regions. Kaon\npotentials are also suitably evaluated in two schemes, a chiral perturbative\napproach and an effective meson-quark coupling method, with consistent results\nshowing a similar repulsive contribution for $K^{+}$ and $K^{0}$. As a\nconsequence we expect rather reduced effects on the yield ratios. We conclude\nthat particle ratios appear to be robust observables for probing the nuclear\nequation of state ($EoS$) at high baryon density and, particularly, its\nisovector sector. \n\n"}

For\nexample, electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) could be triggered by a\nspontaneously broken, nearly conformal sector. The spectrum of states at the\nelectroweak scale would then contain a narrow scalar resonance, the\npseudo-Goldstone boson of conformal symmetry breaking, with Higgs-like\nproperties. If the conformal sector is strongly coupled, this pseudo-dilaton\nmay be the only new state accessible at high energy colliders. We discuss the\nprospects for distinguishing this mode from a minimal Higgs boson at the LHC\nand ILC.

The case is made by\nshowing that all the observed N and Delta resonances with masses below 2500 MeV\ndistribute fairly well each over the first levels of a unitary representation\nof the conformal group, a representation that covers the spectrum of a\nquark-diquark system, placed directly on the AdS_5 cone, conformally\ncompactified to R^1*S^3. The free geodesic motion on the S^3 manifold is\ndescribed by means of the scalar conformal equation there, which is of the\nKlein-Gordon type. The equation is then gauged by the \"curved\" Coulomb\npotential that has the form of a cotangent function. Conformal symmetry is not\nexact, this because the gauge potential slightly modifies the conformal\ncentrifugal barrier of the free geodesic motion. Thanks to this, the degeneracy\nbetween P11-S11 pairs from same level is relaxed, while the remaining states\nbelonging to same level remain practically degenerate. The model describes the\ncorrect mass ordering in the P11-S11 pairs through the nucleon spectrum as a\ncombined effect of the above conformal symmetry breaking, on the one side, and\na parity change of the diquark from a scalar at low masses, to a pseudoscalar\nat higher masses, on the other. The quality of the wave functions is\nillustrated by calculations of realistic mean-square charge radii and electric\ncharge form-factors on the examples of the proton, and the protonic P11(1440),\nand S11(1535) resonances.

The range of clusters observed in\nexperiments goes from $^{14}$C to $^{32}$Si while the heavy mass residue is\nalways a nucleus in the neighborhood of the doubly-magic $^{208}$Pb nucleus.\nCluster radioactivity is described in this paper as a very asymmetric nuclear\nfission. A new fission valley leading to a decay with large fragment mass\nasymmetry matching the cluster radioactivity products is found. The mass\noctupole moment is found to be more convenient than the standard quadrupole\nmoment as the parameter driving the system to fission. The mean-field HFB\ntheory with the phenomenological Gogny interaction has been used to compute the\ncluster emission properties of a wide range of even-even actinide nuclei from\n$^{222}$Ra to $^{242}$Cm, where emission of the clusters has been\nexperimentally observed.

The Yukawa couplings of the triplet fermion and the\nleft-handed neutrinos with the doublet Higgs field produce the Dirac mass\nterms. Together with the Majorana masses for the leptonic triplets, the light\nneutrinos obtain non-zero seesaw masses. We point out that it is also possible\nto have a quadruplet Higgs field to produce the Dirac mass terms to facilitate\nthe seesaw mechanism. The vacuum expectation value of the quadruplet Higgs is\nconstrained to be small by electroweak precision data. Therefore the Yukawa\ncouplings of a quadruplet can be much larger than those for a doublet. We also\nfind that unlike the usual Type III seesaw model where at least two copies of\nleptonic triplets are needed, with both doublet and quadruplet Higgs\nrepresentations, just one leptonic triplet is possible to have a\nphenomenologically acceptable model because light neutrino masses can receive\nsizable contributions at both tree and one loop levels.

Such collisions are used to produce super-strong electric fields by the\nhuge number of interacting protons to test spontaneous positron-electron pair\nemission (vacuum decay) predicted by the quantum electrodynamics (QED) theory.\nMulti-nucleon transfer in actinide collisions could also be used as an\nalternative way to fusion in order to produce neutron-rich heavy and superheavy\nelements thanks to inverse quasifission mechanisms. Actinide collisions are\nstudied in a dynamical quantum microscopic approach. The three-dimensional\ntime-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) code {\\textsc{tdhf3d}} is used with a full\nSkyrme energy density functional to investigate the time evolution of\nexpectation values of one-body operators, such as fragment position and\nparticle number. This code is also used to compute the dispersion of the\nparticle numbers (e.g., widths of fragment mass and charge distributions) from\nTDHF transfer probabilities, on the one hand, and using the Balian-Veneroni\nvariational principle, on the other hand. A first application to test QED is\ndiscussed. Collision times in $^{238}$U+$^{238}$U are computed to determine the\noptimum energy for the observation of the vacuum decay. It is shown that the\ninitial orientation strongly affects the collision times and reaction\nmechanism. The highest collision times predicted by TDHF in this reaction are\nof the order of $\\sim4$ zs at a center of mass energy of 1200 MeV. According to\nmodern calculations based on the Dirac equation, the collision times at\n$E_{cm}>1$ GeV are sufficient to allow spontaneous electron-positron pair\nemission from QED vacuum decay, in case of bare uranium ion collision. A second\napplication of actinide collisions to produce neutron-rich transfermiums is\ndiscussed. A new inverse quasifission mechanism associated to a specific\norientation of the nuclei is proposed to produce transfermium nuclei ($Z>100$)\nin the collision of prolate deformed actinides such as $^{232}$Th+$^{250}$Cf.\nThe collision of the tip of one nucleus with the side of the other results in a\nnucleon flux toward the latter. The probability distributions for transfermium\nproduction in such a collision are computed. The produced nuclei are more\nneutron-rich than those formed in fusion reactions, thus, leading to more\nstable isotopes closer to the predicted superheavy island of stability. In\naddition to mass and charge dispersion, the Balian-Veneroni variational\nprinciple is used to compute correlations between $Z$ and $N$ distributions,\nwhich are zero in standard TDHF calculations. \n\n"}

Such neutrinos would decouple early, with relic densities comparable\nto those of photons, but decay out of equilibrium, with consequent prodigious\nentropy generation prior to, or during, Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). Most of\nthe ranges of sterile neutrino rest mass and lifetime considered are at odds\nwith Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) limits on the relativistic particle\ncontribution to energy density (e.g., as parameterized by N_eff).

The complementary\nand independent BBN and CMB data can break some of these degeneracies.\nDepending on the nature of the light WIMP (Majorana or Dirac fermion, real or\ncomplex scalar) the joint BBN + CMB analyses set a lower bound to m_chi in the\nrange from 0.5 to 5 MeV, and they identify best fit values for m_chi in the\nrange from 5 to 10 MeV.

This view, tested through detailed Monte Carlo\nsimulations, reproduces the main features of radio, X-ray, and gamma-ray blazar\nsurveys and also the extragalactic gamma-ray background at energies > 10 GeV.\nHere we add a hadronic component for neutrino production and estimate the\nneutrino emission from BL Lacs as a class, \"calibrated\" by fitting the spectral\nenergy distributions of a preselected sample of BL Lac objects and their\n(putative) neutrino spectra. Unlike all previous papers on this topic, the\nneutrino background is then derived by summing up at a given energy the fluxes\nof each BL Lac in the simulation, all characterised by their own redshift,\nsynchrotron peak energy, gamma-ray flux, etc. Our main result is that BL Lacs\nas a class can explain the neutrino background seen by IceCube above ~ 0.5 PeV\nwhile they only contribute ~ 10% at lower energies, leaving room to some other\npopulation(s)/physical mechanism. However, one cannot also exclude the\npossibility that individual BL Lacs still make a contribution at the ~ 20%\nlevel to the IceCube low-energy events. Our scenario makes specific predictions\ntestable in the next few years. \n\n"}

The space-time is five dimensional and the extra flat\nspatial dimension is compactified on the orbifold $S^1/(Z_2 \\times Z_2')$,\nleading to Pati-Salam gauge symmetry on the boundary where Yukawa interactions\nare localised. The gauge symmetry breaking is completed by means of a rather\neconomic scalar sector, avoiding the doublet-triplet splitting problem. The\nmatter fields live in the bulk and their massless modes get exponential\nprofiles, which naturally explain the mass hierarchy of the different fermion\ngenerations.

These\ngenerators are divided into two groups: the first group includes the generators\nwhich account for the quark-gluon plasma formation during nuclear collisions,\nwhile the second group includes the generators which do not assume the\nquark-gluon plasma formation in such collisions. Comparing the quality of data\ndescription of more than a hundred of different data sets of strange hadrons by\nthese two groups of generators, we find two regions of the equal quality of\ndata description which are located at the center of mass collision energies\n4.3-4.9 GeV and 10.-13.5 GeV. These two regions of equal quality of data\ndescription we interpret as regions of the hadron-quark-gluon mixed phase\nformation. \n\n"}

Three main techniques can be\nused to achieve this goal. The first involves waveform modelling. The flux we\nobserve from a hotspot on the neutron star surface offset from the rotational\npole will be modulated by the star's rotation, giving rise to a pulsation.\nInformation about mass and radius is encoded into the pulse profile via\nrelativistic effects, and tight constraints on mass and radius can be obtained.\nThe second technique involves characterising the spin distribution of accreting\nneutron stars. The most rapidly rotating stars provide a very clean constraint,\nsince the mass-shedding limit is a function of mass and radius. However the\noverall spin distribution also provides a guide to the torque mechanisms in\noperation and the moment of inertia, both of which can depend sensitively on\ndense matter physics. The third technique is to search for quasi-periodic\noscillations in X-ray flux associated with global seismic vibrations of\nmagnetars (the most highly magnetized neutron stars), triggered by magnetic\nexplosions.

Those $(d,p)$ reactions\nmay be viewed as effective three-body reactions and described with Faddeev\ntechniques. An additional challenge posed by $(d,p)$ reactions involving\nheavier nuclei is the treatment of the Coulomb force. To avoid numerical\ncomplications in dealing with the screening of the Coulomb force, recently a\nnew approach using the Coulomb distorted basis in momentum space was suggested.\nIn order to implement this suggestion separable representations of neutron- and\nproton-nucleus optical potentials, which are not only complex but also energy\ndependent, need to be introduced.

In fact, the\nuncertainties of these LECs are so small that a variation within the errors\nleads to effects that are essentially negligible, reducing the error budget of\npredictions considerably. The NN potentials are fit to the world NN data below\npion-production threshold of the year of 2016.\n  The potential of the highest order (N4LO) reproduces the world NN data with\nthe outstanding chi^2/datum of 1.15, which is the highest precision ever\naccomplished for any chiral NN potential to date.

The axion star as coherent state of\naxions with mass $m_a$ generates homogeneous electric field oscillating with\nfrequency $m_a/2\\pi$ under strong magnetic fields. The field makes electrons\ncoherently oscillate and emit the coherent dipole radiations ( FRBs ). The\nradiations stop when thermal fluctuations produced by the oscillation disturb\nthe coherent oscillations. Thus, the duration of the FRBs is determined by the\ntime scale of the thermalization; it is much shorter than $1$ms. Line spectra\nof the dipole radiations are broadened by the thermal effects. The thermally\nbroaden spectra have a feature that the bandwidths $\\delta\\nu$ are proportional\nto their center frequencies $\\nu_c$. The presence of various center frequencies\n( $1.2$GHz$\\sim $$7$GHz ) in repeating FRB 121102 is attributed to Doppler\nshifts owing to the various relativistic velocities of the accretion disk. On\nthe other hand, non repeating FRBs do not show such variety of the center\nfrequencies. They come from the surfaces of neutron stars.

{"id": "astro-ph/0403657", "contents": "Title: Minimal Cooling of Neutron Stars: A New Paradigm Abstract: A new classification of neutron star cooling scenarios, involving either\n``minimal'' cooling or ``enhanced'' cooling is proposed. The minimal cooling\nscenario replaces and extends the so-called standard cooling scenario to\ninclude neutrino emission from the Cooper pair breaking and formation process.\nThis emission dominates that due to the modified Urca process for temperatures\nclose to the critical temperature for superfluid pairing. Minimal cooling is\ndistinguished from enhanced cooling by the absence of neutrino emission from\nany direct Urca process, due either to nucleons or to exotica. Within the\nminimal cooling scenario, theoretical cooling models can be considered to be a\nfour parameter family involving the equation of state of dense matter,\nsuperfluid properties of dense matter, the composition of the neutron star\nenvelope, and the mass of the neutron star. Consequences of minimal cooling are\nexplored through extensive variations of these parameters. Results are compared\nwith the inferred properties of thermally-emitting neutron stars in order to\nascertain if enhanced cooling occurs in any of them. All stars for which\nthermal emissions have been clearly detected are at least marginally consistent\nwith the lack of enhanced cooling. The two pulsars PSR 0833-45 (Vela) and PSR\n1706-44 would require enhanced cooling in case their ages and/or temperatures\nare on the lower side of their estimated values whereas the four stars PSR\n0656+14, PSR 1055-52, Geminga, and RX J0720.4-3125 may require some source of\ninternal heating in case their age and/or luminosity are on the upper side of\ntheir estimated values.

Most of these are known in the quenched\napproximation to $\\sim 10%$ accuracy or better, and preliminary estimates of\nquenching errors are of comparable size.

Formalism and main results Abstract: We develop a formalism for particle production in a field theory coupled to a\nstrong time-dependent external source. An example of such a theory is the Color\nGlass Condensate. We derive a formula, in terms of cut vacuum-vacuum Feynman\ngraphs, for the probability of producing a given number of particles. This\nformula is valid to all orders in the coupling constant. The distribution of\nmultiplicities is non--Poissonian, even in the classical approximation. We\ninvestigate an alternative method of calculating the mean multiplicity. At\nleading order, the average multiplicity can be expressed in terms of retarded\nsolutions of classical equations of motion. We demonstrate that the average\nmultiplicity at {\\it next-to-leading order} can be formulated as an initial\nvalue problem by solving equations of motion for small fluctuation fields with\nretarded boundary conditions.

Alongside with two baryon-rich fluids, the new model considers\ntime-delayed evolution of a third, baryon-free (i.e. with zero net baryonic\ncharge) fluid of newly produced particles. Its evolution is delayed due to a\nformation time, during which the baryon-free fluid neither thermalizes nor\ninteracts with the baryon-rich fluids. After the formation it starts to\ninteract with the baryon-rich fluids and quickly gets thermalized. Within this\nmodel with pure hadronic equation of state, a systematic analysis of various\nobservables at incident energies between few and about 160A GeV has been done\nas well as comparison with results of transport models. We have succeeded to\nreasonably reproduce a great body of experimental data in the incident energy\nrange of E_{lab} = (1-160)A GeV. The list includes proton and pion rapidity\ndistributions, proton transverse-mass spectra, rapidity distributions of Lambda\nand antiLambda hyperons, elliptic flow of protons and pions (with the exception\nof proton v2 at 40A GeV), multiplicities of pions, positive kaons, phi-mesons,\nhyperons and antihyperons, including multi-strange particles.

At high temperatures\n(above the critical temperature T_c) we use the sound velocity function\nobtained from the recent lattice simulations of QCD, whereas at low\ntemperatures we use the ideal hadron gas model.

My task was to\nshow that Misha's work had been deeply woven in the fabric of today's theory.\nThe second part is an attempt to highlight one of many facets of Misha's human\nportrait. In the 1980's, being a refusenik in Moscow, he volunteered to teach\nphysics under unusual circumstances. I present recollections of people who were\ninvolved in this activity. \n\n"}
