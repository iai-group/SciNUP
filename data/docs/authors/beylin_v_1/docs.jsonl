In this \\emph{Letter}, we\nexamine the possibility that these can be supplied by the fast accretion shocks\nformed around the cores of the most massive haloes ($10.5< \\log M/M_{\\odot} <\n12$) on spatial scales of order 1 kpc. We model the detailed physics of these\nfast accretion shocks, and apply these to a simple 1-D spherical hydrodynamic\naccretion model for baryonic infall in dark matter halos with an Einasto\ndensity distribution. The escape of UV photons from these halos is delayed by\nthe time taken to reach the critical accretion shock velocity for escape of UV\nphotons; 220 km s$^{-1}$, and by the time it takes for these photons to ionize\nthe surrounding baryonic matter in the accretion flow. Assuming that in the\nuniverse at large the baryonic matter tracks the dark matter, we can estimate\nthe epoch of re-ionization in the case that accretion shocks act alone as the\nsource of UV photons. We find that 50% of the volume (and 5-8% of the mass) of\nthe universe can be ionized by $z \\sim 7-8$. The UV production rate has an\nuncertainty of a factor of about 5 due to uncertainties in the cosmological\nparameters controlling the development of large scale structure. Because our\nmechanism is a steeply rising function of decreasing redshift, this uncertainty\ntranslates to a re-ionization redshift uncertainty of less than $\\pm0.5$. We\nalso find that, even without including the UV photon production of stars,\nre-ionization is essentially complete by $z \\sim 5.8$. Thus, fast accretion\nshocks can provide an important additional source of ionizing photons in the\nearly universe. \n\n"}

We have performed a rigorous statistical combination of\nseveral Higgs boson search channels which is important because mUED signatures\nfrom the Higgs boson are not universally enhanced.\n  We have found that 1/R < 500 GeV is excluded at 95% CL, while for larger 1/R\nonly a very narrow (\\pm1-4 GeV) mass window around m_h = 125 GeV and another\nwindow (up to 2 GeV wide for 1/R > 1000 GeV) around m_h = 118 GeV are left.

In the late time Universe\nwhen reionisation occurs, the spectrum of the 21cm brightness temperature is\nthus affected. We study this effect for chameleon-f(R) models, dilatons and\nsymmetrons.

In this paper\nwe propose an alternative strategy to combine direct and collider dark matter\nsearches: employing the potential of the upcoming generation of 1-ton direct\ndetection experiments, we show that for certain supersymmetric configurations\nit is possible to translate the information encoded in an hypothetically\ndiscovered direct detection signal into classes of expected signals at the LHC.\nAs an illustrative application of our method, we show that for a 60 GeV\nneutralino thermally produced via resonant annihilations and identified by a\n1-ton direct detection experiment, our approach allows to forecast a clearly\nidentifiable prediction for a LHC final state involving three leptons and\nmissing energy. The strategy presented in this paper to systematically\ntranslate a direct detection signal into a prediction for the LHC has the\npotential to significantly strengthen the complementarity between these two\ndark matter detection strategies. \n\n"}

Given the seemingly stringent\nnature of the latter, it was thought for nearly a decade that SIDM would be\nviable only if the cross section for self-scattering was strongly\nvelocity-dependent. However, it has recently been suggested that a constant\ncross section per unit mass of sigma_T/m~0.1cm^2/g is sufficient to accomplish\nthe desired effect. We explicitly investigate this claim using high resolution\ncosmological simulations of a Milky-Way size halo and find that, similarly to\nthe Cold Dark Matter case, such cross section produces a population of massive\nsubhaloes that is inconsistent with the kinematics of the classical dwarf\nspheroidals, in particular with the inferred slopes of the mass profiles of\nFornax and Sculptor. This problem is resolved if sigma_T/m~1cm^2/g at the dwarf\nspheroidal scales.

{"id": "1304.4579", "contents": "Title: The Natural Composite Higgs Abstract: The discovery of the Higgs boson has put considerable pressure on theories\nthat aim to solve the hierarchy problem. Scenarios in which the Higgs is a\npseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson (NGB) of some new strong dynamics must possess a\nnumber of non-generic features in order to pass the progressively stringent\ncollider bounds and simultaneously meet our naturalness criteria. Among these\nfeatures are the existence of light fermionic partners of the top quark and an\nefficient collective breaking of the Nambu-Goldstone symmetry. The top partners\nhave to be not only parametrically lighter than the other composites, but also\nweakly coupled to them in order to suppress unwanted flavor-violating effects.\nA Natural pseudo-NGB Higgs model should also be able to fit the LHC Higgs data\nwithout fine-tuning. Among theories with comparable compositeness scales, those\nthat predict smaller corrections in the Higgs couplings to the standard model\nparticles are therefore preferred.\n  A concrete implementation of these ingredients is discussed in a scenario\nbased on the coset SU(5)/SO(5). The fit to the current LHC Higgs data is\nsignificantly improved compared to the minimal scenarios, and a fully natural\nexplanation of both the weak scale and the Higgs boson mass can be attained. An\nimportant role is played by an independent quartic Higgs coupling generated by\nUV-sensitive loops involving electroweak doublets mixing with the top partners.\nThe collider signature of this framework is shown to be rather model-dependent;\nin particular, the exotic scalars can alter the phenomenology of the top\npartners at a qualitative level. \n\n"}

However,\ncalculations of the lifetime of the SM vacuum have shown that it vastly exceeds\nthe age of the Universe. It was pointed out by two of us (VB,EM) that these\ncalculations are extremely sensitive to effects from Planck scale\nhigher-dimensional operators and, without knowledge of these operators, firm\nconclusions about the lifetime of the SM vacuum cannot be drawn. The previous\npaper used analytical approximations to the potential and, except for Higgs\ncontributions, ignored loop corrections to the bounce action. In this work, we\ndo not rely on any analytical approximations and consider all contributions to\nthe bounce action, confirming the earlier result. It is surprising that the\nPlanck scale operators can have such a large effect when the instability is at\n$10^{11}$ GeV. There are two reasons for the size of this effect. In typical\ntunneling calculations, the value of the field at the center of the critical\nbubble is much larger than the point of the instability; in the SM case, this\nturns out to be numerically within an order of magnitude of the Planck scale.\nIn addition, tunneling is an inherently non-perturbative phenomenon, and may\nnot be as strongly suppressed by inverse powers of the Planck scale. We include\neffective $\\Phi^6$ and $\\Phi^8$ Planck-scale operators and show that they can\nhave an enormous effect on the tunneling rate. \n\n"}

Recent work has shown\nthat, with a polynomial parameterisation of the WIMP speed distribution, it is\npossible to make an unbiased measurement of the WIMP mass, without making any\nastrophysical assumptions. However, direct detection experiments are not\nsensitive to low-speed WIMPs and, therefore, any model-independent approach\nwill lead to a bias in the cross section. This problem can be solved with the\naddition of measurements of the flux of neutrinos from the Sun. This is because\nthe flux of neutrinos produced from the annihilation of WIMPs which have been\ngravitationally captured in the Sun is sensitive to low-speed WIMPs. Using mock\ndata from next-generation direct detection experiments and from the IceCube\nneutrino telescope, we show that the complementary information from IceCube on\nlow-speed WIMPs breaks the degeneracy between the cross section and the speed\ndistribution. This allows unbiased determinations of the WIMP mass and\nspin-independent and spin-dependent cross sections to be made, and the speed\ndistribution to be reconstructed.

This document\nsummarizes the discussions by the participants, which in turn led to the\ncoherent conclusions we present here. \n\n"}

These observations indicate\nthat the primordial power spectrum is nearly scale-invariant with amplitude\nclose to $2 \\times 10^{-9}$, [5, 20-25]. They also strongly support Inflation\nand motivate us to obtain constraints reaching to smaller scales on the\nprimordial curvature power spectrum and by implication on Inflation.

We show that scattering rates involving\ngauge fields can become larger than the expansion rate $H$, due to the very\nlarge occupation numbers, and create a thermal bath of particles of temperature\n$T$ during inflation. In the thermal regime, energy is transferred to smaller\nscales, radically modifying the predictions of this scenario. We thus argue\nthat previous constraints on $\\xi$ are alleviated. If the gauge fields have\nStandard Model interactions, which naturally provides reheating, they\nthermalize already at $\\xi\\gtrsim2.9$, before perturbativity constraints and\nalso before backreaction takes place.

These have been put forward in the context of\ngravitational waves (GWs) from the compact binary inspiral. The mature\ndevelopment of this interdisciplinary field has resulted in significant\nadvances of wide interest to physics at several levels serving various\npurposes. The field has firmly demonstrated, that seemingly disparate physical\ndomains, such as quantum field theory and classical gravity, are related, and\nthat the EFT framework is a universal one, where it has been proven to supply a\nrobust methodology to boost progress in the development of PN theory. The\nreview is aimed at a broad audience, from general readers new to the field, to\nspecialists and experts in related subjects.\n  The review begins with an overview of the introduction of EFTs into classical\ngravity and their development. Then, the basic ideas, which form the conceptual\nfoundation of EFTs, are provided, and the strategy of a multi-stage EFT\nframework, which is utilized for the PN binary inspiral problem, is outlined.\nThe main body of the review is then dedicated to presenting in detail the study\nof each of the effective theories at each of the intermediate scales in the\nproblem, up to the actual GW observables. The review is concluded with the\nmultiple prospects of building on the progress in the field, and using further\nmodern field theory insights and tools, to specifically address the study of\nGWs, as well as to broadly expand our fundamental understanding of gauge and\ngravity theories across the classical and quantum regimes. \n\n"}

In this\nwork we explore the non-linear dynamics of those modes in a conformal fluid.\nAmong all possible SOTs, we choose to work with the Divergence Type Theories\n(DTT) formalism, which ensures that the second law of thermodynamics is\nsatisfied non-perturbatively. In considering a perturbative scheme within this\nformalism, at next to leading order a set of Maxwell-Cattaneo equations is\nobtained, as in e.g. Israel-Stewart theories. The tensor modes include two\ndivergence-free modes which have no analog in theories based on covariant\nNavier-Stokes equations, and that are particularly relevant because they may\ncouple linearly to a gravitational field. To study the dynamics of this\nirreducible tensor sector, we observe that in causal theories such as DTTs,\nthermal fluctuations induce a stochastic stirring force in the equations of\nmotion, which excites the tensor modes while preserving energy momentum\nconservation. From fluctuation-dissipation considerations, it follows that the\nrandom force is Gaussian with a white spectrum. The irreducible tensor modes in\nturn excite vector modes, which back-react on the tensor sector, thus producing\na consistent non-linear, second order description of the divergence-free tensor\ndynamics.

An unified\nformula for the quantum decay rate of all these objects was provided in\nhep-ph/0202249. The key point in the top-down scenarii is the necessity to {\\bf\nadjust} the lifetime of the heavy object to the age of the universe. The\nnatural lifetimes of such heavy objects are, however, microscopic times\nassociated to the GUT energy scale (sim 10^{-28} sec. or shorter); such heavy\nobjects could have been abundantly formed by the end of inflation and it seems\nnatural they decayed shortly after being formed. The arguments produced to {\\bf\nfine tune} the relics lifetime to the age of the universe are critically\nanalyzed. The annihilation scenario (`Wimpzillas') is analyzed too. Top-down\nscenarii based on networks of topological defects are strongly disfavored at\nthe light of the recent CMB anisotropy observations. We discuss the\nacceleration mechanisms of cosmic rays,their possible astrophysical sources and\nthe main open physical problems and difficulties in the context of bottom-up\nscenarii, and we conclude by outlining the expectations from future\nobservatories like EUSO and where the theoretical effort should be placed. \n\n"}

Using a power-law form for the\nprimordial power spectrum $P_{in}(k)$ and constraining the scalar spectral\nindex and its running, \\cite{Peiris03} found that the first year WMAP data seem\nto indicate a preferred scale in $P_{in}(k)$.

Within the Hartree\nfactorization scheme, we show that the O(N) model has at least two observable\nremains left behind the off-equilibrium processes: the running spectral index\nof primordial density perturbations and the correlations between perturbation\nmodes in phase space. We find that the running of the spectral index is fully\ndetermined by the rate of the energy transfer from the inflationary background\nfield to its fluctuations via particle creation processes as well as the\ndynamics of the background field itself. Furthermore, the amplitude of the\nfield fluctuations turns out to be scale-dependent due to the off-equilibrium\nevolution.

Tunneling is a first order phase transition. The creation of\nmetastable bound states of instanton-antinstanton pairs under the barrier\n,(i.e. resonant tunneling), is the seed that gives rise to particle production.\nThrough the application of the Lee-Yang theorem for phase transitions, (as well\nas demonstrating the underlying connection this has with the poles of the\nS-matrix element in the quantum scattering theory), we show that the\nfluctuations around the dominant escape paths of instantons (i.e. fluctuations\nof the bubble wall) with momenta comparable to the scale curvature of the\nbubble, drive the mechanism for resonant tunneling in false vacuum decay.

Abstract: Hybrid $ c \\bar c g$ of quantum numbers $1^{--}$ are considered in a quark\nmodel with constituant quarks and gluon. The lowest $J^P=1^-$ states may be\nbuilt in two ways, $l_g=1$ (gluon excited) corresponding to an angular momentum\nbetween the gluon and the $c \\bar c$ system, while $l_{c\\bar c}=1$ (quark\nexcited) corresponds to an angular momentum between the $c$ and the $\\bar c$.\nThe lowest lying hybrid $J^P=1^-$ state in the flux tube model is similar to\nthe $l_g=1$ in the quark-gluon model. In particular it verifies the selection\nrule that it cannot decay into two fundamental mesons. The $l_{q\\bar q}=1$\nhybrid may decay into two fundamental mesons, but with decay widths larger than\n1 GeV, which tells that they do not really exist as resonant states. Using a\nchromoharmonic potential, we find no mixing between the $l_g=1$ and $l_{c\\bar\nc}=1$. More realistic potentials might induce a strong mixing between them,\nimplying that no hybrid meson exist. If, on the contrary, such a strong mixing\ndoes not occur, we find, in agreement with the flux tube model, that only the\n$l_g=1$ appears as a real resonant state. In such a case, hybrid mesons may\nexist as resonances only if they are decoupled from the ground state channels,\nwhich explains the difficulty to observe them experimentally. We reconsider\naccordingly the Ono-Close-Page scenario of mixing between charmonium and\ncharmed-hybrid to explain the anomalies around 4.1 GeV. We find a very small\nmixing between radially excited charmonium and hybrid mesons, which forbids\nconsidering the $\\psi(4.040)$ and $\\psi(4.160)$ as combinations of 3S\ncharmonium and $l_g=1$ hybrid meson with a large mixing. \n\n"}

Even though\nperturbations of Cuscuton propagate superluminally, we show that they have a\nlocally degenerate phase space volume (or zero entropy), implying that they\ncannot carry any microscopic information, and thus the theory is causal. Even\ncoupling to ordinary scalar fields cannot lead to superluminal signal\npropagation. Furthermore, we show that the family of constant field\nhypersurfaces are the family of Constant Mean Curvature (CMC) hypersurfaces,\nwhich are the analogs of soap films (or soap bubbles) in a Euclidian space.\nThis enables us to find the most general solution in 1+1 dimensions, whose\nproperties motivate conjectures for global degeneracy of the phase space in\nhigher dimensions.
