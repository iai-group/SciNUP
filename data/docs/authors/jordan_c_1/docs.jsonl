Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on\nthe role that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in\nglobular clusters, e.g., influencing the distribution of horizontal branch\nstars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of some globular clusters, and in\nforming low mass white dwarfs. \n\n"}

The number ratios are measured\nindirectly in the simulations due to their resolution limitations. Our approach\ncontains one free parameter, the lifetime of a protostellar object t_yso (Class\n0 + Class I stages), which is outside the realm of the simulations. Assuming a\nvalue t_yso = 0.46 Myr, we obtain number ratios of starless to stellar cores\nranging from 4-5 at n_thr = 1.5 x 10^4 cm^-3 to 1 at n_thr = 1.2 x 10^5 cm^-3,\nagain in good agreement with observational determinations.

Such asymmetries are usually neglected\nin abundance analyses. The determination of the 6Li/7Li isotopic ratio is prone\nto suffering from such asymmetries, as the contribution of 6Li is a slight\nblending reinforcement of the red wing of each component of the corresponding\n7Li line, with respect to its blue wing. Aims: The present paper studies the\nhalo star HD 74000 and estimates the impact of convection-related asymmetries\non the Li isotopic ratio determination. Method: Two methods are used to meet\nthis aim. The first, which is purely empirical, consists in deriving a template\nprofile from another element that can be assumed to originate in the same\nstellar atmospheric layers as Li I, producing absorption lines of approximately\nthe same equivalent width as individual components of the 7Li I resonance line.\nThe second method consists in conducting the abundance analysis based on NLTE\nline formation in a 3D hydrodynamical model atmosphere, taking into account the\neffects of photospheric convection. Results: The results of the first method\nshow that the convective asymmetry generates an excess absorption in the red\nwing of the 7Li absorption feature that mimics the presence of 6Li at a level\ncomparable to the hitherto published values. This opens the possibility that\nonly an upper limit on 6Li/7Li has thus far been derived. The second method\nconfirms these findings.

For star-forming galaxies, M*-SFR is observed to be fairly tight with\na slope close to unity from z~0-2. Simulations of galaxy formation reproduce\nthese trends owing to the generic dominance of smooth and steady cold accretion\nin these systems. In contrast, the amplitude of the M*-SFR relation evolves\nmarkedly differently than in models. Stated in terms of a star formation\nactivity parameter alpha=(M*/SFR)/(t_H-1 Gyr), models predict a constant\nalpha~1 out to redshifts z=4+, while the observed M*-SFR relation indicates\nthat alpha increases by X3 from z~2 until today. The low alpha at high-z not\nonly conflicts with models, but is also difficult to reconcile with other\nobservations of high-z galaxies. Systematic biases could significantly affect\nmeasurements of M* and SFR, but detailed considerations suggest that none are\nobvious candidates to reconcile the discrepancy. A speculative solution is\nconsidered in which the stellar initial mass function (IMF) evolves towards\nmore high-mass star formation at earlier epochs. Following Larson, a model is\ninvestigated in which the characteristic mass Mhat where the IMF turns over\nincreases with redshift. The observed and predicted M*-SFR evolution may be\nbrought into agreement if Mhat=0.5(1+z)^2 Mo out to z~2. Such evolution broadly\nmatches recent observations of cosmic stellar mass growth, and the resulting\nz=0 cumulative IMF is similar to the paunchy IMF favored by Fardal et al to\nreconcile the observed cosmic star formation history with present-day fossil\nlight measures.

This generalized expression, which is\napplicable to the external regions of dark matter haloes, only very slightly\naffects the density in the inner regions of haloes. The strong correlation\namong the different parameters in the model allows us to describe the profile\nin terms of just one parameter: the virial mass. We integrate our density\nprofile to derive the enclosed mass in a sphere of a given radius and compare\nit with the NFW results. We find that the NFW underestimates the enclosed mass\nby more than 50% at 10R_{vir}, whereas our model reproduces the results from\nnumerical simulations to within 2% accuracy even at this distance.

However, considerable progress unraveling their mysteries has been made in\nrecent years. Developments in observations, theory, and instrumentation have\nprepared the way so that the next decade can be the one in which we finally\nanswer the question, \"What are gamma-ray bursts?\" This question encompasses not\nonly what the progenitors are that produce the GRBs, but also how the enormous\nluminosity of the GRBs, concentrated in gamma rays, is achieved. Observations\nacross the electromagnetic spectrum, from both the ground and space, will be\nrequired to fully tackle this important question. This white paper, mostly\ndistilled from a recent study commissioned by the Division of Astrophysics of\nthe American Physical Society, focuses on what very high energy (~100 GeV and\nabove) gamma-ray observations can contribute. Very high energy gamma rays probe\nthe most extreme high energy particle populations in the burst environment,\ntesting models of lepton and proton acceleration in GRBs and constraining the\nbulk Lorentz factor and opacity of the outflow. Sensitivity improvements of\nmore than an order of magnitude in the very high energy gamma-ray band can be\nachieved early in the next decade, in order to contribute to this science. \n\n"}
{"id": "0902.4695", "contents": "Title: Do blue compact galaxies have red halos? Abstract: Red halos are faint, extended and extremely red structures that have been\nreported around various types of galaxies since the mid-1990s. The colours of\nthese halos are too red to be reconciled with any hitherto known type of\nstellar population, and instead indicative of a very bottom-heavy stellar\ninitial mass function (IMF). Due to the large mass-to-light ratios of such\nstellar halos, they could contribute substantially to the baryonic masses of\ngalaxies while adding very little to their overall luminosities. The red halos\nof galaxies therefore constitute potential reservoirs for some of the baryons\nstill missing from inventories in the low-redshift Universe. While most studies\nof red halos have focused on disk galaxies, a red excess has also been reported\nin the faint outskirts of blue compact galaxies (BCGs). A bottom-heavy IMF can\nexplain the colours of these structures as well, but due to model degeneracies,\nstellar populations with standard IMFs and abnormally high metallicities have\nalso been demonstrated to fit the data. Here, we show that due to recent\ndevelopments in the field of spectral synthesis, the metallicities required in\nthis alternative scenario may be less extreme than previously thought. This\nsuggests that the red excess seen in the outskirts of BCGs may stem from a\nnormal, intermediate-metallicity host galaxy rather than a red halo of the type\nseen around disk galaxies. The inferred host metallicity does, however, still\nrequire the host to be more metal-rich than the gas in the central starburst of\nBCGs, in contradiction with current simulations of how BCGs form. \n\n"}

Cluster masses\n  derived from unresolved photometry Abstract: It is currently common to use spatially unresolved multi-filter broad-band\nphotometry to determine the masses of individual stellar clusters (and hence\nthe cluster mass function, CMF). I analyze the stochastic effects introduced by\nthe sampling of the stellar initial mass function (SIMF) in the derivation of\nthe individual masses and the CMF and I establish that such effects are the\nlargest contributor to the observational uncertainties. An analytical solution,\nvalid in the limit where uncertainties are small, is provided to establish the\nrange of cluster masses over which the CMF slope can be obtained with a given\naccuracy. The validity of the analytical solution is extended to higher mass\nuncertainties using Monte Carlo simulations and the Gamma approximation. The\nvalue of the Poisson mass is calculated for a large range of ages and a variety\nof filters for solar-metallicity clusters measured with single-filter\nphotometry. A method that uses the code CHORIZOS is presented to simultaneously\nderive masses, ages, and extinctions. The classical method of using unweighted\nUBV photometry to simultaneously establish ages and extinctions of stellar\nclusters is found to be unreliable for clusters older than approx. 30 Ma, even\nfor relatively large cluster masses. On the other hand, augmenting the filter\nset to include longer-wavelength filters and using weights for each filter\nincreases the range of masses and ages that can be accurately measured with\nunresolved photometry. Nevertheless, a relatively large range of masses and\nages is found to be dominated by SIMF sampling effects that render the observed\nmasses useless, even when using UBVRIJHK photometry. A revision of some\nliterature results affected by these effects is presented and possible\nsolutions for future observations and analyses are suggested. \n\n"}

If this is interpreted as an age\nspread, the multiple populations are separated by a few hundred Myr, which\nwould call into question the long held notion that clusters are simple stellar\npopulations. Here we show that stellar rotation in stars with masses between\n1.2-1.7 Msun can mimic the effect of a double or multiple population, whereas\nin actuality only a single population exists. The two main causes of the spread\nnear the turn-off are the effects of stellar rotation on the structure of the\nstar and the inclination angle of the star relative to the observer.

In this sense, M94 is a good example of a Type III (anti-truncated)\ndisk galaxy having a very bright outer disk. The outer disk of this galaxy\ncontains ~23% of the total stellar mass budget of the galaxy and contributes\n~10% of the new stars created showing that this region of the galaxy is active.\nIn fact, the specific star formation rate of the outer disk (~0.012 Gyr^{-1})\nis a factor of ~2 larger (i.e. the star formation is more efficient per unit\nstellar mass) than in the inner disk. We have explored different scenarios to\nexplain the enhanced star formation in the outer disk.

Comparison of the AMI observations with radio observations at lower\nfrequencies with matched uv-plane coverage is made, in order to search for any\nanomalous excess emission which can be attributed to spinning dust. Possible\nemission from spinning dust is identified as a source within a 2' radius of the\nScuba position of the Lynds dark nebula, exhibiting an excess with respect to\nlower frequency radio emission. We find five sources which show a possible\nspinning dust component in their spectra. These sources have rising spectral\nindices in the frequency range 14.2--17.9 GHz.

We have studied the\ndynamical evolution of these Multi-state Boson Stars (MSBS) under radial\nperturbations, using numerical techniques. We show that stable MSBS can be\nconstructed, when the number of particles in the first excited state, N2, is\nsmaller than the number of particles in the ground state, N1. On the other\nhand, when N2 > N1, the configurations are initially unstable. However, they\nevolve and settle down into stable configurations. In the stabilization\nprocess, the initially ground state is excited and ends in a first excited\nstate, whereas the initially first excited state ends in a ground state. During\nthis process, both states emit scalar field radiation, decreasing their number\nof particles. This behavior shows that even though BS in the first excited\nstate are intrinsically unstable under finite perturbations, the configuration\nresulting from the combination of this state with the ground state produces\nstable objects.

However, with\nthe addition of spectroscopic information it is possible to distinguish between\nblends and areas where the light is dominated by a single star using the widths\nof absorption features. We describe a procedure for identifying locations in\nkinematically hot environments where the light is dominated by a single star,\nand apply this method to spectra with 0.1 arcsec angular resolution covering\nthe 2.1 - 2.3 micron interval in the central regions of M32. Targets for\ndetailed investigation are selected as areas of localized brightness\nenhancement. Three locations where at least 60% of the K-band light comes from\na single bright star, and another with light that is dominated by two stars\nwith very different velocities, are identified. The dominant stars are evolving\nnear the tip of the asymptotic giant branch (AGB), and have M5 III spectral\ntype. The lack of a dispersion in spectral-type suggests that the upper AGB\nwithin the central arcsec of M32 has a dispersion in J-K of only a few\nhundreths of a magnitude, in agreement with what is seen at larger radii. One\nstar has weaker atomic absorption lines than the others, such that [M/H] is 0.2\ndex lower. Such a difference in metallicity is consistent with the metallicity\ndispersion inferred from the width of the AGB in M32. The use of line width to\ndistinguish between blends involving many relatively faint stars, none of which\ndominate the light output, and areas that are dominated by a single\nintrinsically bright star could be extended to crowded environments in other\nnearby galaxies. \n\n"}

Our hypothesis is\nthat dynamical evolution in outer planetary systems is controlled by a\ncombination of planet-planet scattering and planetary interactions with an\nexterior disk of small bodies (\"planetesimals\"). Using 5,000 long duration\nN-body simulations, we follow the evolution of three planets surrounded by a 50\nEarth mass primordial planetesimal disk. For large planet masses (above that of\nSaturn) the influence of the disk is modest, and we recover the observed\neccentricity distribution of extrasolar planets (observed primarily at smaller\nradii). We explain the observed mass dependence of the eccentricity by invoking\nstrong correlations between planet masses in the same system. For lower mass\nplanets we observe diverse dynamical behavior: strong scattering events, sudden\njumps in eccentricity due to resonance crossings, and re-circularization of\nscattered low-mass planets in the disk. We present distributions of the final\neccentricity and inclination, and discuss how they vary with planet mass and\ninitial system architecture.

To explain the 24 micron emission, we\npostulate that the grains are replenished within the wind-blown bubble by\ndestruction of embedded, dense cloudlets of ISM gas that have been over-run by\nthe expanding wind-blown bubble. We calculate the ablation timescales for\ncloudlets within N49 and find approximate parameters for the embedded cloudlets\nthat can replenish the dust; the parameters for the cloudlets are roughly\nsimilar to those observed in other nebula.

We use four independent methods for characterizing the sizes of\nionized regions. Three of them give us a full size distribution: the\nfriends-of-friends (FOF) method, the spherical average method (SPA) and the\npower spectrum (PS) of the ionized fraction. These latter three methods are\ncomplementary: While the FOF method captures the size distribution of the small\nscale H II regions, which contribute only a small amount to the total\nionization fraction, the spherical average method provides a smoothed measure\nfor the average size of the H II regions constituting the main contribution to\nthe ionized fraction, and the power spectrum does the same while retaining more\ndetails on the size distribution. Our fourth method for characterizing the\nsizes of the H II regions is the average size which results if we divide the\ntotal volume of the H II regions by their total surface area, (i.e. 3V/A),\ncomputed in terms of the ratio of the corresponding Minkowski functionals of\nthe ionized fraction field. To characterize the topology of the ionized\nregions, we calculate the evolution of the Euler Characteristic. We find that\nthe evolution of the topology during the first half of reionization is\nconsistent with inside-out reionization of a Gaussian density field. We use\nthese techniques to investigate the dependence of size and topology on some\nbasic source properties, such as the halo mass-to-light ratio, susceptibility\nof haloes to negative feedback from reionization, and the minimum halo mass for\nsources to form.

We compile recent measurements of\nthe Type-Ia SN (SN Ia) rate in galaxy clusters at redshifts z=0-1.45.

We test DTD models from the\nliterature, requiring that they simultaneously reproduce the observed cluster\nSN rates and the observed iron-to-stellar mass ratios. A power-law DTD of the\nform t^{-1.2+/-0.3}, extending to a Hubble time, can satisfy both constraints.\nShallower power laws, such as t^{-1/2} cannot, assuming a single DTD, and a\nsingle star-formation burst (either brief or extended) at high z.

Our study compares four\ndifferent density profiles (uniform, Bonnor-Ebert type, $\\rho\\propto r^{-1.5}$,\nand $\\rho\\propto r^{-2}$), combined with six different supersonic turbulent\nvelocity fields (compressive, mixed, and solenoidal, initialised with two\ndifferent random seeds each) in three-dimensional simulations using the\nadaptive-mesh refinement, hydrodynamics code FLASH. The simulations show that\ndensity profiles with flat cores produce hundreds of low-mass stars, either\ndistributed throughout the entire cloud or found in subclusters, depending on\nthe initial turbulence. Concentrated density profiles always lead to the\nformation of one high-mass star in the centre of the cloud and, if at all,\nlow-mass stars surrounding the central one. In uniform and Bonnor-Ebert type\ndensity distributions, compressive initial turbulence leads to local collapse\nabout 25% earlier than solenoidal turbulence.

In this study we focus on understanding the\nmatter clustering at several redshifts. The primordial non-Gaussianity is\nmodeled as a quadratic correction to the local Gaussian potential, and is\ncharacterized by the parameter f_NL. In our formulation of the halo model we\npay special attention to the effect of halo exclusion, and show that this can\npotentially solve the long standing problem of excess power on large scales in\nthis model. The model depends on the mass function, clustering and density\nprofiles of halos. We test these ingredients using a large ensemble of\nhigh-resolution Gaussian and non-Gaussian numerical simulations. In particular,\nwe provide a first exploration of how density profiles change in the presence\nof primordial non-Gaussianities. We find that for f_NL positive/negative high\nmass halos have an increased/decreased core density, so being more/less\nconcentrated than in the Gaussian case. We also examine the halo bias and show\nthat, if the halo model is correct, then there is a small asymmetry in the\nscale-dependence of the bias on very large scales, which arises because the\nGaussian bias must be renormalized.

{"id": "1104.0252", "contents": "Title: Supernova Fallback onto Magnetars and Propeller-Powered Supernovae Abstract: We explore fallback accretion onto newly born magnetars during the supernova\nof massive stars. Strong magnetic fields (~10^{15} G) and short spin periods\n(~1-10 ms) have an important influence on how the magnetar interacts with the\ninfalling material. At long spin periods, weak magnetic fields, and high\naccretion rates, sufficient material is accreted to form a black hole, as is\ncommonly found for massive progenitor stars. When B<5*10^{14} G, accretion\ncauses the magnetar to spin sufficiently rapidly to deform triaxially and\nproduce gravitational waves, but only for ~50-200 s until it collapses to a\nblack hole. Conversely, at short spin periods, strong magnetic fields, and low\naccretion rates, the magnetar is in the \"propeller regime\" and avoids becoming\na black hole by expelling incoming material. This process spins down the\nmagnetar, so that gravitational waves are only expected if the initial\nprotoneutron star is spinning rapidly. Even when the magnetar survives, it\naccretes at least ~0.3 solar masses, so we expect magnetars born within these\ntypes of environments to be more massive than the 1.4 solar masses typically\nassociated with neutron stars. The propeller mechanism converts the ~10^{52}\nergs of spin energy in the magnetar into the kinetic energy of an outflow,\nwhich shock heats the outgoing supernova ejecta during the first ~10-30 s.

These galaxies are found to be strongly concentrated towards the cores of\nthe five clusters that make up the SSC, and also appear rare among local field\ngalaxies, confirming them as a cluster-specific phenomenon. Their optical\nspectra and lack of significant UV emission imply little or no ongoing star\nformation, while fits to their panchromatic SEDs require the far-IR emission to\ncome mostly from a diffuse dust component heated by the general interstellar\nradiation field rather than ongoing star formation.

The Wiener Filter method is used to recover the full 3D peculiar\nvelocity field from the observed map of radial velocities and to recover the\nunderlying linear density field. The velocity field within a data zone of 3000\nkm/s is decomposed into a local component that is generated within the data\nzone and a tidal one that is generated by the mass distribution outside that\nzone. The tidal component is characterized by a coherent flow toward the\nNorma-Hydra-Centaurus (Great Attractor) region while the local component is\ndominated by a flow toward the Virgo Cluster and away from the Local Void.

However a major uncertainty is the estimate of the orbital\ninclination angle of an X-ray binary. Here we suggest to measure the black hole\nmass in an X-ray binary by measuring directly the black hole's orbital motion,\nthus obtaining the companion to black hole mass ratio. In this method we assume\nthat accretion disk wind moves with the black hole and thus the black hole's\norbital motion can be obtained from the Doppler velocity of the absorption\nlines produced in the accretion disk wind. We validate this method by analyzing\nthe Chandra/HETG observations of GRO J1655-40, in which the black hole orbital\nmotion with line of sight velocity of 90.8 (+-11.3) km/s, inferred from the\nDoppler velocity of disk-wind absorption lines, is consistent with the\nprediction from its previously measured system parameters. We obtain the black\nhole mass of 5.41 (+0.98, -0.57) solar masses and system inclination of 72.0\n(+7.8, -7.5) degrees in GRO J1655-40. Additional observations of this source\ncovering more orbital phases can improve estimates on its system parameters\nsubstantially. We then apply the method to the black hole X-ray binary LMC X-3\nobserved with HST/COS near orbital phase 0.75. We find that the disk-wind\nabsorption lines of CIV doublet were shifted to about 50 km/s, which yields a\ncompanion-to-black-hole mass ratio of 0.6 for an assumed disk wind velocity of\n-400 km/s. Additional observations covering other orbital phases (0.25 in\nparticular) are crucial to ease this assumption and then to directly constrain\nthe mass ratio.

We suggest that the GRB prompt emission is\nmainly a result of two upscattering processes. The first process is the\nComptonization of relatively cold soft photons of the star off electrons of a\nhot shell of plasma of temperature T_e of the order of 10^{9} K (or kT_e~100\nkeV) that moves sub-relativistically with the bulk velocity V_b substantially\nless than the speed of light c. In this phase, the Comptonization parameter Y\nis high and the interaction between a blackbody-like soft seed photon\npopulation and hot electrons leads to formation of a saturated Comptonization\nspectrum modified by the sub-relativistic bulk outflow. The second process is\nan upscattering of the previously Comptonized spectrum by the plasma outflow\nonce it becomes relativistic.

Abstract: AGN are known to account for a major portion, if not all, of the cosmic X-ray\nbackground radiation. The dominant sharp spectral feature in their spectra is\nthe 6.4 keV fluorescent line of iron, which may contribute to as much as ~ 5-10\n% of the CXB spectral intensity at ~ 2-6 keV. Owing to cosmological redshift,\nthe line photons detected at the energy E carry information about objects\nlocated at the redshift z=6.4/E-1. In particular, imprinted in their angular\nfluctuations is the information about the large-scale structure at redshift z.\nThis opens the possibility of performing the Fe K_alpha line tomography of the\ncosmic large-scale structure. We show that detection of the tomographic signal\nat ~100 sigma confidence requires an all-sky survey by an instrument with an\neffective area of ~10 m^2 and field of view of ~1 deg^2. The signal is\nstrongest for objects located at the redshift z~1 and at the angular scales\ncorresponding to l ~ 100-300, therefore an optimal detection can be achieved\nwith an instrument having a rather modest angular resolution of ~ 0.1-0.5 deg.\nFor such an instrument, the CCD-type energy resolution of ~ 100-200 eV FWHM is\nentirely sufficient for the optimal separation of the signals coming from\ndifferent redshifts.

The gas in\nthese galaxies is not in perfect hydrostatic equilibrium. Supernova feedback,\nstellar winds, or active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback can significantly\nperturb the interstellar medium (ISM). Using hydrodynamical simulations, we\ninvestigate the effect of subsonic turbulence in the hot ISM on the ram\npressure stripping process in early-type galaxies. We find that galaxies with\nmore turbulent ISM produce longer, wider, and more smoothly distributed tails\nof the stripped ISM than those characterised by weaker ISM turbulence. Our main\nconclusion is that even very weak internal turbulence, at the level of <15% of\nthe average ISM sound speed, can significantly accelerate the gas removal from\ngalaxies via ram pressure stripping. The magnitude of this effect increases\nsharply with the strength of turbulence. As most of the gas stripping takes\nplace near the boundary between the ISM and the intraclustermedium (ICM), the\nboost in the ISM stripping rate is due to the \"random walk\" of the ISM from the\ncentral regions of the galactic potential well to larger distances, where the\nram pressure is able to permanently remove the gas from galaxies. The ICM can\nbe temporarily trapped inside the galactic potential well due to the mixing of\nthe turbulent ISM with the ICM. The galaxies with more turbulent ISM, yet still\ncharacterised by very weak turbulence, can hold larger amounts of the ICM.\n[Abridged] \n\n"}

The half-mass radius of star clusters increases\nsystematically with galactocentric distance but levels off when star clusters\norbit the galaxy beyond ~40 kpc. These simulations show that the half-mass\nradius of individual star clusters varies significantly as they evolve over a\nHubble time, more so for clusters with shorter relaxation times, and remains\nconstant through several relaxation times only in certain situations when\nexpansion driven by the internal dynamics of the star cluster and the influence\nof the host galaxy tidal field balance each other.

Furthermore, the half-mass radius of star clusters\nmeasured with present day observations bears no memory of the original cluster\nsize.

We find dark matter inside the star would soften the equation of\nstate more strongly than that of hyperons, and reduce largely the maximum mass\nof the star. However, the neutron star maximum mass is sensitive to the\nparticle mass of dark matter, and a very high neutron star mass larger than 2\ntimes solar mass could be achieved when the particle mass is small enough. Such\nkind of dark-matter- admixed neutron stars could explain the recent measurement\nof the Shapiro delay in the radio pulsar PSR J1614-2230, which yielded a\nneutron star mass of 2 times solar mass that may be hardly reached when\nhyperons are considered only, as in the case of the microscopic Brueckner\ntheory.

Astrophysical discovery in such data sets is\ncomplicated by the fact that detections of real transient and variable sources\nare highly outnumbered by bogus detections caused by imperfect subtractions,\natmospheric effects and detector artefacts. In this work we present a machine\nlearning (ML) framework for discovery of variability in time-domain imaging\nsurveys. Our ML methods provide probabilistic statements, in near real time,\nabout the degree to which each newly observed source is astrophysically\nrelevant source of variable brightness. We provide details about each of the\nanalysis steps involved, including compilation of the training and testing\nsets, construction of descriptive image-based and contextual features, and\noptimization of the feature subset and model tuning parameters.

The Chandra data reveal soft (kT_e ~ 0.2-0.5keV)\ndiffuse emission in the nuclear starburst region and extending ~5kpc to the\nnorth and west of the nucleus. Much of this soft hot gas is likely to be from\nlocal active star-forming regions; however, besides the nuclear region, the\nmorphology of hot gas does not strongly correlate with sites of active star\nformation. The central ~650 pc radius starburst zone exhibits much higher\nsurface brightness diffuse emission than the surrounding regions and a harder\nspectral component in addition to its soft component. We interpret the hard\ncomponent as being of thermal origin with kT_e~3.6keV and to be directly\nassociated with a wind fluid produced by supernovae and massive star winds. The\ninferred terminal velocity for this hard component, ~1100 km/s, exceeds the\nlocal galaxy escape velocity suggesting a potential outflow. The softer\nextended emission does not display an obvious outflow geometry. However, the\ncolumn density through which the X-rays are transmitted is lower to the west of\nthe nucleus compared to the east and the surface brightness is higher there\nsuggesting some soft hot gas originates from above the disk; viewed directly\nfrom the western zone but through the intervening galaxy disk from the eastern\nzone. There are several point-like sources in the nuclear region with X-ray\nspectra typical of compact binaries. None of these are coincident with the mass\ncenter of the galaxy and we place an upper limit luminosity from any point-like\nnuclear source to be < 2x10^38 ergs/s in the 0.5-8.0keV band which indicates\nthat NGC 2903 lacks an active galactic nucleus.

Archival data from the\nWSRT was reduced and a new calibration technique introduced to reach the high\ndynamic ranges needed for the complex source morphology of M82. This data was\ncombined with archival VLA data, yielding total power maps at 3cm, 6cm, 22cm\nand 92cm. The data shows a confinement of the emission at wavelengths of 3/6cm\nto the core region and a largely extended halo reaching up to 4kpc away from\nthe galaxy midplane at wavelengths of 22/92cm up to a sensitivity limit of\n90muJy and 1.8mJy respectively. The results are used to calculate the magnetic\nfield strength in the core region to 98muG and to 24muG in the halo regions.\nFrom the observation of free-free losses the filling factor of the ionised\nmedium could be estimated to 2%. We find that the radio emission from the core\nregion is dominated by very dense HII-regions and supernova remnants, while the\nsurrounding medium is filled with hot X-ray and neutral gas. Cosmic rays\nradiating at frequencies higher than 1.4 GHz are suffering from high\nsynchrotron and inverse Compton losses in the core region and are not able to\nreach the halo. Even the cosmic rays radiating at longer wavelengths are only\nable to build up the observed kpc sized halo, when several starbursting periods\nare assumed where the photon field density varies by an order of magnitude.\nThese findings together with the strong correlation between Halpha, PAH+, and\nour radio continuum data suggests a magnetic field which is frozen into the\nionised medium and driven out of the galaxy kinematically. \n\n"}

In this paper we find a highly significant\nassociation between brightest X-ray sources in the Antennae galaxies and\nstellar clusters.

We study clusters associated with the ULXs\nusing the ESO Very Large Telescope spectra and the Hubble Space Telescope data\ntogether with the theoretical evolutionary tracks and determine their ages to\nbe below 6 Myr.

Although this\npotential has no minimum, we think it captures the important dynamics that\noccurs as $m^2$ goes through zero, at which time a large spike in the density\nperturbations is generated. We assume that the time-delay formalism provides an\naccurate approximation to the density perturbations, and proceed to calculate\nthe power spectrum of the time delay fluctuations. While the evolution of the\nfield is linear, the time delay is a nonlinear function to which all modes\ncontribute.

Abstract: We investigate the large-scale clustering and gravitational interaction of\nbaryons and dark matter (DM) over cosmic time using a set of collisionless\nN-body simulations. Both components, baryons and DM, are evolved from distinct\nprimordial density and velocity power spectra as predicted by early-universe\nphysics. We first demonstrate that such two-component simulations require an\nunconventional match between force and mass resolution (i.e. force softening on\nat least the mean particle separation scale). Otherwise, the growth on any\nscale is not correctly recovered because of a spurious coupling between the two\nspecies at the smallest scales. With these simulations, we then demonstrate how\nthe primordial differences in the clustering of baryons and DM are\nprogressively diminished over time. In particular, we explicitly show how the\nBAO signature is damped in the spatial distribution of baryons and imprinted in\nthat of DM. This is a rapid process, yet it is still not fully completed at low\nredshifts. On large scales, the overall shape of the correlation function of\nbaryons and DM differs by 2% at z = 9 and by 0.2% at z = 0. The differences in\nthe amplitude of the BAO peak are approximately a factor of 5 larger: 10% at z\n= 9 and 1% at z = 0. These discrepancies are, however, smaller than effects\nexpected to be introduced by galaxy formation physics in both the shape of the\npower spectrum and in the BAO peak, and are thus unlikely to be detected given\nthe precision of the next generation of galaxy surveys. Hence, our results\nvalidate the standard practice of modelling the observed galaxy distribution\nusing predictions for the total mass clustering in the Universe. \n\n"}

The average physical properties of this circumgalactic medium\n(CGM) are determined by combining average absorption and emission measurements\nalong several extragalactic sightlines.

The column densities along these\ntwo sightlines are similar within errors, but we find that the emission\nmeasures are different. Therefore the densities and pathlengths in the two\ndirections must be different, providing a suggestive evidence that the warm-hot\ngas in the CGM of the Milky Way is not distributed uniformly. However, the\nformal errors on derived parameters are too large to make such a claim. The\naverage density and pathlength of the two sightlines are similar to the global\naverages, so the halo mass is still huge, over 10 billion solar masses.

X-ray polarimetry investigates the\nacceleration process, for example, including those typical of magnetic\nreconnection in solar flares, but also emission in the strong magnetic fields\nof neutron stars and white dwarfs. It detects scattering in asymmetric\nstructures such as accretion disks and columns, and in the so-called molecular\ntorus and ionization cones. In addition, it allows fundamental physics in\nregimes of gravity and of magnetic field intensity not accessible to\nexperiments on the Earth to be probed. Finally, models that describe\nfundamental interactions (e.g. quantum gravity and the extension of the\nStandard Model) can be tested.

Our aim is twofold: firstly, analyse the relationship between\nexcess-continuum and line emission accretion diagnostics, and, secondly, to\ninvestigate the accretion properties in terms of the physical properties of the\ncentral object. The accretion luminosity (Lacc), and from it the accretion rate\n(Macc), is derived by modelling the excess emission, from the UV to the\nnear-IR, as the continuum emission of a slab of hydrogen. The flux and\nluminosity (Ll) of a large number of emission lines of H, He, CaII, etc.,\nobserved simultaneously in the range from ~330nm to 2500nm, were computed. The\nluminosity of all the lines is well correlated with Lacc. We provide empirical\nrelationships between Lacc and the luminosity of 39 emission lines, which have\na lower dispersion as compared to previous relationships in the literature. Our\nmeasurements extend the Pab and Brg relationships to Lacc values about two\norders of magnitude lower than those reported in previous studies.

An\napplication where realistic uncertainty assessments are especially important is\nthe intermediate neutron capture process or i process: a neutron capture regime\nwith neutron densities intermediate between the slow and rapid processes.\nAccordingly, the main network flux proceeds on the neutron-rich unstable\nisotopes up to 4-5 species off the valley of stability.

Aperture mass statistics are an appropriate\nchoice for 3rd-order statistics due to their simple form and their ability to\nseparate E- and B-modes of the shear. However, it has been demonstrated that\n2nd-order aperture mass statistics suffer from E-/B-mode mixing because it is\nimpossible to reliably estimate the shapes of close pairs of galaxies. This\nfinding has triggered developments of several new 2nd-order statistical\nmeasures for cosmic shear. Whether the same developments are needed for\n3rd-order shear statistics is largely determined by how severe this E-/B-mixing\nis for 3rd-order statistics. We test 3rd-order aperture mass statistics against\nE-/B-mode mixing, and find that the level of contamination is well-described by\na function of $\\theta/\\theta_{\\rm min}$, with $\\theta_{\\rm min}$ being the\ncut-off scale.

In particular, the Big Bang nucleosynthesis\nprovides a strong test for every dark matter candidate, since it is well\nstudied and involves relatively few free parameters. The necessity of accurate\nstudies of primordial nucleosynthesis with mirror matter has then emerged. In\norder to fill this lack, I present here the results of accurate numerical\nsimulations of the primordial production of both ordinary nuclides and nuclides\nmade of mirror baryons, in presence of a hidden mirror sector with unbroken\nparity symmetry and with gravitational interactions only.

The two\npeaks are respectively blue-shifted and red-shifted relative to the host\ngalaxies and are separated by ~5000 km/s.

Due to their random orientations, only a\nfraction of SNe with intrinsically bi-modal velocity distributions will appear\nas doubly-peaked spectra.

Abstract: Our current view of galaxies considers them as systems of stars and gas\nembedded in extended halos of dark matter, much of it formed by the infall of\nsmaller systems at earlier times. The true extent of a galaxy remains poorly\ndetermined, with the virial radius (R_vir) providing a characteristic\nseparation between collapsed structures in dynamical equilibrium and external\ninfalling matter. Other physical estimates of the extent of gravitational\ninfluence include the gravitational radius, gas accretion radius, and\n\"galactopause\" arising from outflows that stall at 100-200 kpc over a range of\noutflow parameters and confining gas pressures. Physical criteria are proposed\nto define bound structures, including a more realistic definition of R_vir (M*,\nM_h, z_a) for stellar mass M* and halo mass M_h, half of which formed at\n\"assembly redshifts\" z_a = 0.7-1.3. We estimate the extent of bound gas and\ndark matter around L* galaxies to be ~200 kpc. The new virial radii, with mean\nR_vir ~ 200 kpc, are 40-50% smaller than values estimated in recent HST/COS\ndetections of H I and O VI absorbers around galaxies. In the new formalism, the\nMilky Way stellar mass, log M* = 10.7 +/- 0.1, would correspond to R_vir = 153\n(+25,-16) kpc for half-mass halo assembly at z_a = 1.06 +/- 0.03. The frequency\nper unit redshift of low-redshift O VI absorption lines in QSO spectra suggests\nabsorber sizes ~150 kpc when related to intervening 0.1L* galaxies.

Whether\nlarge scale fields are amplified in situ or a remnant from previous stages of\nan object's history is often debated for objects without a definitive magnetic\nactivity cycle. Magnetic helicity, a measure of twist and linkage of magnetic\nfield lines, is a unifying tool for understanding large scale field evolution\nfor both mechanisms of origin. Its importance stems from its two basic\nproperties: (1) magnetic helicity is typically better conserved than magnetic\nenergy; and (2) the magnetic energy associated with a fixed amount of magnetic\nhelicity is minimized when the system relaxes this helical structure to the\nlargest scale available.

The gravitational torque\non the disc from an inclined binary makes the disc precess around the binary\naxis, while the star-disc interaction torque due to the rotation-induced\nquadrupole makes the stellar spin and the disc angular momentum axes precess\naround each other. A significant star-disc misalignment angle can be generated\nfrom a small initial value as the star-disc system evolves in time such that\nthe two precession frequencies cross each other. This ``secular resonance''\nbehavior can be understood in a geometric way from the precession dynamics of\nspin and disc angular momenta. We derive the conditions for such resonance to\noccur, and find that they can be satisfied for reasonable protostar-disc-binary\nparameters. The evolution of star-disc inclination is also affected by mass\naccretion and by magnetic star-disc interaction torques, which can either\npromote or reduce star-disc misalignment. In general, as long as the initial\nbinary-disc inclination is greater than a few degrees, a variety of star-disc\nmisalignment angles can be generated within the disc lifetimes.

Using a novel technique to construct\ndrizzled PSF libraries for HST/ACS data, we accurately determine the fidelity\nof GC structural parameter measurements from detailed artificial star cluster\nexperiments. The measurement of rh for the major fraction of the NGC1399 GC\nsystem reveals a trend of increasing rh versus galactocentric distance, Rgal,\nout to about 10 kpc and a flat relation beyond. This trend is very similar for\nblue and red GCs which are found to have a mean size ratio of\nrh(red)/rh(blue)=0.82+/-0.11 at all galactocentric radii from the core regions\nof the galaxy out to ~40 kpc. This suggests that the size difference between\nblue and red GCs is due to internal mechanisms related to the evolution of\ntheir constituent stellar populations. Modeling the mass density profile of\nNGC1399 shows that additional external dynamical mechanisms are required to\nlimit the GC size in the galaxy halo regions to rh~2 pc. We suggest that this\nmay be realized by an exotic GC orbit distribution function, an extended dark\nmatter halo, and/or tidal stress induced by the increased stochasticity in the\ndwarf halo substructure at larger Rgal. We match our GC rh measurements with\nradial velocity data from the literature and find that compact GCs show a\nsignificantly smaller line-of-sight velocity dispersion, <sigma(cmp)>=225+/-25\nkm/s, than their extended counterparts, <sigma(ext)>=317+/-21 km/s. Considering\nthe weaker statistical correlation in the GC rh-color and the GC rh-Rgal\nrelations, the more significant GC size-dynamics relation appears to be\nastrophysically more relevant and hints at the dominant influence of the GC\norbit distribution function on the evolution of GC structural parameters. \n\n"}

The\naccretion regimes that allow growth of the WDs are usually calculated assuming\nconstant mass-transfer rates. However, it is possible that these systems are\ninfluenced by effects that cause the rate to fluctuate on various timescales.\nWe investigate how long-term mass-transfer variability affects accreting WDs\nsystems. We show that, if such variability is present, it expands the parameter\nspace of binaries where the WD can effectively increase its mass. Furthermore,\nwe find that the supernova type Ia (SNIa) rate is enhanced by a factor 2-2.5 to\na rate that is comparable with the lower limit of the observed rates. The\nchanges in the delay-time distribution allow for more SNIae in stellar\npopulations with ages of a few Gyr. Thus, mass-transfer variability gives rise\nto a new formation channel of SNIa events that can significantly contribute to\nthe SNIa rate. Mass-transfer variability is also likely to affect other binary\npopulations through enhanced WD growth.

However, the formation of wide binaries through the\ndissolution of supervirial regions is a strong function of primary mass, and\nthe wide G-dwarf and A-star binaries that are destroyed by dynamical evolution\nin subvirial regions are replenished by the formation of binaries in\nsupervirial regions. We therefore suggest that the binary population in the\nfield is $indicative$ of the primordial binary population in star-forming\nregions, at least for systems with primary masses in the range 0.02 -\n3.0M$_\\odot$. \n\n"}

All three\nnon-ideal MHD effects, Ohmic resistivity, the Hall effect and ambipolar\ndiffusion are included in a self-consistent manner based on equilibrium\nchemistry. We focus on regions toward outer disk radii, from 5-60AU, where\nOhmic resistivity tends to become negligible, ambipolar diffusion dominates\nover an extended region across disk height, and the Hall effect largely\ncontrols the dynamics near the disk midplane. We find that around R=5AU, the\nsystem launches a laminar/weakly turbulent magnetocentrifugal wind when the net\nvertical field Bz is not too weak, as expected. Moreover, the wind is able to\nachieve and maintain a configuration with reflection symmetry at disk midplane.\nThe case with anti-aligned field polarity (Omega. Bz<0) is more susceptible to\nthe MRI when Bz drops, leading to an outflow oscillating in radial directions\nand very inefficient angular momentum transport. At the outer disk around and\nbeyond R=30AU, the system shows vigorous MRI turbulence in the surface layer\ndue to far-UV ionization, which efficiently drives disk accretion. The Hall\neffect affects the stability of the midplane region to the MRI, leading to\nstrong/weak Maxwell stress for aligned/anti-aligned field polarities.\nNevertheless, the midplane region is only very weakly turbulent. Overall, the\nbasic picture is analogous to the conventional layered accretion scenario\napplied to the outer disk.

In this way, most of the standard timing\nanalysis can be performed, albeit with a sacrifice in signal to noise relative\nto what would be achieved using more standard techniques.

We\ndescribe here a new method using time-delay lensed quasars where one or several\nimages are affected by microlensing due to stars in the lensing galaxy. Because\nmicrolensing decreases (or increases) the flux of the continuum compared to the\nbroad line region, it changes the contrast between these two emission\ncomponents. We show that this effect can be used to effectively disentangle the\nintrinsic variability of those two regions, offering the opportunity to perform\nreverberation mapping based on single band photometric data. Based on simulated\nlight curves generated using a damped random walk model of quasar variability,\nwe show that measurement of the size of the broad line region can be achieved\nusing this method, provided one spectrum has been obtained independently during\nthe monitoring. This method is complementary to photometric reverberation\nmapping and could also be extended to multi-band data. Because the effect\ndescribed above produces a variability pattern in difference light curves\nbetween pairs of lensed images which is correlated with the time-lagged\ncontinuum variability, it can potentially produce systematic errors in\nmeasurement of time delays between pairs of lensed images. Simple simulations\nindicate that time-delay measurement techniques which use a sufficiently\nflexible model for the extrinsic variability are not affected by this effect\nand produce accurate time delays. \n\n"}

Such curvature in the gamma-ray spectrum of 1H 0323+342 and PMN\nJ0948+0022 can be due to emission region located inside the broad line region\n(BLR) where the primary mechanism of the gamma-ray emission is inverse-Compton\n(IC) scattering of BLR photons occurring in the Klein-Nishina regime.

This density-dependent effect\noperates volumetrically rather than only on molecular cloud surfaces (i.e.\nunlike FUV radiation that also destroys CO), and is facilitated by: a) the\ndirect destruction of CO by CRs, and b) a reaction channel activated by\nCR-produced He$^{+}$.

In the past several years, 3D numerical\nsimulations made it possible to compute pulsar spindown luminosity from first\nprinciples and revealed that oblique pulsar winds are more powerful than\naligned ones. However, what causes this enhanced power output of oblique\npulsars is not understood. In this work, using time-dependent 3D\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) and force-free simulations, we show that, contrary to\nthe standard paradigm, the open magnetic flux, which carries the energy away\nfrom the pulsar, is laterally non-uniform. We argue that this non-uniformity is\nthe primary reason for the increased luminosity of oblique pulsars. To\ndemonstrate this, we construct simple analytic descriptions of aligned and\northogonal pulsar winds and combine them to obtain an accurate 3D description\nof the pulsar wind for any obliquity. Our approach describes both the warped\nmagnetospheric current sheet and the smooth variation of pulsar wind properties\noutside of it. We find that generically the magnetospheric current sheet\nseparates plasmas that move at mildly relativistic velocities relative to each\nother. This suggests that the magnetospheric reconnection is a type of driven,\nrather than free, reconnection. The jump in magnetic field components across\nthe current sheet decreases with increasing obliquity, which could be a\nmechanism that reduces dissipation in near-orthogonal pulsars. Our analytical\ndescription of the pulsar wind can be used for constructing models of pulsar\ngamma-ray emission, pulsar wind nebulae, and magnetar-powered core-collapse\ngamma-ray bursts and supernovae. \n\n"}

A signal can\nfurther be classified as Gaussian-stochastic if a Gaussian signal model is\nfavored. In our analysis we use Bayesian model selection to choose between\nseveral signal and noise models for simulated data consisting of uncorrelated\nGaussian detector noise plus a superposition of sinusoidal signals from an\nastrophysical population of gravitational-wave sources. For simplicity, we\nconsider co-located and co-aligned detectors with white detector noise, but the\nmethod can be extended to more realistic detector configurations and power\nspectra.

We determined\nthat the accretion disc radius, measured from the double-peaked emission line\nprofiles, is persistently large and lies within the range of 0.45-0.52a, where\na is the binary separation. This is close to the tidal truncation radius\nr_max=0.52a. This result contradicts with previous radius measurements.

Apart from a ring of disc emission, the tomograms display\nat least three areas of enhanced emission: the hot spot from the area of\ninteraction between the gas stream and the disc, which is superposed on the\nelongated spiral structure, and the extended bright region on the leading side\nof the disc, opposite to the location of the hot spot. The position of the hot\nspot in all the emission lines is consistent with the trajectory of the gas\nstream.

The significance of the\ncorrelations is evaluated using two different approaches: simulating light\ncurves and mixed source correlations.

We perform a series of\nscans over the NMSSM parameter space, compute the DM annihilation cross section\ninto two photons and the contribution of box-shaped features, and compare them\nwith the limits derived from the Fermi-LAT search for gamma-ray lines using the\nlatest Pass 8 data.

We also consider the recent upper limits from the Fermi-LAT\nsatellite on the continuum gamma-ray emission from dwarf spheroidal galaxies\n(dSphs). We show that in the case of the RH sneutrino the constraint on\ngamma-ray spectral features can be more stringent than the dSph bounds. This is\ndue to the Breit-Wigner enhancement near the ubiquitous resonances with a CP\neven Higgs and the contribution of scalar and pseudoscalar Higgs final states\nto box-shaped features. By contrast, for neutralino DM, the di-photon final\nstate is only enhanced in the resonance with a $Z$ boson and box-shaped\nfeatures are even more suppressed. Therefore, the observation of spectral\nfeatures could constitute a discriminating factor between both models. In\naddition, we compare our results with direct DM searches, including the\nSuperCDMS and LUX limits on the elastic DM-nucleus scattering cross section and\nshow that some of these scenarios would be accessible to next generation\nexperiments.

Robustness of the UDGs to tidal disruption seems to require,\nwithin Newtonian dynamics, that they are much more massive than their observed\nstellar component.

BWPs are binary millisecond pulsars with companion masses ranging from\n0.01-0.1 solar masses which often exhibit radio eclipses. The bloated\ncompanions in BWP systems exert small torques on the system causing the orbit\nto change on small but measurable time scales. Because adding parameters to a\ntiming model reduces sensitivity to a gravitational wave (GW) signal, the need\nto fit many orbital frequency derivatives to the timing data is potentially\nproblematic for using BWPs to detect GWs with pulsar timing arrays. Using\nsimulated data with up to four orbital frequency derivatives, we show that\nfitting for orbital frequency derivatives absorbs less than 5% of the low\nfrequency spectrum expected from a stochastic gravitational wave background\nsignal. Furthermore, this result does not change with orbital period.\nTherefore, we suggest that if timing systematics can be accounted for by\nmodeling orbital frequency derivatives and is not caused by spin frequency\nnoise, pulsar timing array experiments should include BWPs in their arrays. \n\n"}

However, its detection requires a thorough\nunderstanding and control of the systematic errors. We study two systematic\nbiases observed in the LOFAR EoR residual data after calibration and\nsubtraction of bright discrete foreground sources. The first effect is a\nsuppression in the diffuse foregrounds, which could potentially mean a\nsuppression of the 21 cm signal. The second effect is an excess of noise beyond\nthe thermal noise. The excess noise shows fluctuations on small frequency\nscales, and hence it can not be easily removed by foreground removal or\navoidance methods. Our analysis suggests that sidelobes of residual sources due\nto the chromatic point spread function and ionospheric scintillation can not be\nthe dominant causes of the excess noise. Rather, both the suppression of\ndiffuse foregrounds and the excess noise can occur due to calibration with an\nincomplete sky model containing predominantly bright discrete sources. We show\nthat calibrating only on bright sources can cause suppression of other signals\nand introduce an excess noise in the data. The levels of the suppression and\nexcess noise depend on the relative flux of sources which are not included in\nthe model with respect to the flux of modeled sources.

The intensity profiles of iron and oxygen in Solar Energetic\nParticle (SEP) events often display differences that result in a decreasing\nFe/O ratio over time. The physical mechanisms behind this behaviour are not\nfully understood, but these observational signatures provide important tests of\nphysical modelling efforts. Aims. In this paper we study the propagation of\niron and oxygen SEP ions using a 3D model of propagation which includes the\neffect of guiding centre drift in a Parker spiral magnetic field. We derive\ntime intensity profiles for a variety of observer locations and study the\ntemporal evolution of the Fe/O ratio. Methods. We use a 3D full orbit test\nparticle model which includes scattering. The configuration of the\ninterplanetary magnetic field is a unipolar Parker spiral. Particles are\nreleased instantaneously from a compact region at 2 solar radii and allowed to\npropagate in 3D. Results. Both Fe and O experience significant transport across\nthe magnetic field due to gradient and curvature drifts. We find that Fe ions\ndrift more than O ions due to their larger mass-to-charge ratio, so that an\nobserver that is not magnetically well connected to the source region will\nobserve Fe arriving before O, for particles within the same range in energy per\nnucleon. As a result, for the majority of observer locations, the Fe/O ratio\ndisplays a decrease in time. Conclusions. We conclude that propagation effects\nassociated with drifts produce a decay over time of the Fe/O ratio,\nqualitatively reproducing that observed in SEP event profiles. \n\n"}

ET0097 is the first observed\ncarbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) star in the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy.\nBecause C is enriched and the elements heavier than Ba are not overabundant,\nET0097 can be classified as a CEMP-no star. However, this star shows\noverabundances of lighter n-capture elements (i.e., Sr, Y and Zr). In this\nwork, having adopted the abundance decomposition approach, we investigate the\nastrophysical origins of the elements in ET0097. We find that the light\nelements and iron-peak elements (from O to Zn) of the star mainly originate\nfrom the primary process of massive stars and the heavier n-capture elements\n(heavier than Ba) mainly come from the main r-process. However, the lighter\nn-capture elements such as Sr, Y and Zr should mainly come from the primary\nweak s-process. The contributed fractions of the primary weak s-process to the\nSr, Y and Zr abundances of ET0097 are about 82%, 84% and 58% respectively,\nsuggesting that the CEMP star ET0097 should have the footprints of the weak\ns-process.

We investigate whether\nthe abundance patterns of CEMP-s/r stars can arise from the nucleosynthesis of\nthe intermediate neutron-capture process (the i process), which is\ncharacterised by neutron densities between those of the s and the r processes.\nUsing nuclear network calculations, we study neutron capture nucleosynthesis at\ndifferent constant neutron densities n ranging from $10^7$ to $10^{15}$\ncm$^{-3}$. With respect to the classical s process resulting from neutron\ndensities on the lowest side of this range, neutron densities on the highest\nside result in abundance patterns that show an increased production of heavy\ns-process and r-process elements but similar abundances of the light s-process\nelements.

Employing hydrodynamic\nsimulations in full general relativity, we find that the one-arm instability is\ngeneric in that it can develop in HMNSs within a few tens of milliseconds after\nmerger for all equations of state in our survey. We find that mergers with\nstiffer equations of state tend to produce HMNSs with stronger $m=2$ azimuthal\nmode density deformations, and weaker $m=1$ components, relative to softer\nequations of state. We also find that for equations of state that can give rise\nto double-core HMNSs, large $m=1$ density modes can already be present due to\nasymmetries in the two cores. This results in the generation of $l=2$, $m=1$\ngravitational wave modes even before the dominance of a one-arm mode that\nultimately arises following merger of the two cores. Our results further\nsuggest that stiffer equations of state give rise to HMNSs generating lower\n$m=1$ gravitational wave frequencies.

In this paper, we assemble a\nfew data samples of local and distant star-forming galaxies to analyse various\ndust-related quantities in low and high redshift galaxies, to study how the\nrelations linking the dust mass to the stellar mass and star formation rate\nevolve with redshift. We interpret the available data by means of chemical\nevolution models for discs and proto-spheroid (PSPH) starburst galaxies. In\nparticular, we focus on the dust-to-stellar mass (DTS) ratio, as this quantity\nrepresents a true measure of how much dust per unit stellar mass survives the\nvarious destruction processes in galaxies and is observable. The theoretical\nmodels outline the strong dependence of this quantity on the underlying star\nformation history.

We aim\nto quantify the importance of a treatment of the ionisation fraction in\nturbulent magnetised media and investigate the effect of turbulence on shaping\nthe clouds and filaments before star formation sets in. In particular, we\ninvestigate how the structure, mass and width of filamentary structures depend\non the amount of turbulence in ionised media and the initial mass-to-flux\nratio. We compare the resulting density and mass-to-flux ratio structures both\nqualitatively and quantitatively via filament and core masses and filament\nfitting techniques (Gaussian and Plummer profiles.) We find that even with\nalmost no turbulence, filamentary structure still exists. Comparison of\nsimulations show that for turbulent Mach numbers above 2, there is little\nstructural difference between the Step-Like (SL) and Cosmic Ray only (CR-only)\nionisation models, while below this threshold the ionisation structure\nsignificantly affects the formation of filaments.

At a\nfixed stellar mass, galaxies with higher $D_n4000$ have larger velocity\ndispersions and smaller sizes. $D_n4000$ is a proxy for stellar population age,\nthus these trends suggest that older galaxies typically have larger velocity\ndispersions and smaller sizes. We combine velocity dispersion and size into a\ndynamical mass estimator, $\\sigma^2 R$. At a fixed stellar mass, $\\sigma^2 R$\ndepends on $D_n4000$. The S\\'ersic index is also correlated with $D_n4000$. The\ndependence of $\\sigma^2 R$ and S\\'ersic index on $D_n4000$ suggests that\nquiescent galaxies are not structurally homologous systems. We derive an\nempirical correction for non-homology which is consistent with the analytical\ncorrection derived from the virial theorem. After accounting for non-homologous\ngalactic structure, we measure $M_\\ast \\propto M_d^{0.998 \\pm 0.004}$ where\n$M_\\ast$ is the stellar mass and $M_d$ is the dynamical mass derived from the\nvelocity dispersion and size; stellar mass is directly proportional to\ndynamical mass.

The\nfraction of mass in the outflow relative to the total envelope (i.e.\n$M_{\\mathrm{out}}/M_{\\mathrm{env}}$) remains broadly constant between Class 0\nand I.

Their\ndeconvolved radii at 33 GHz are only a few au. The 8-346 GHz SEDs of FU Ori and\nFU Ori S cannot be fit by constant spectral indices (over frequency). The more\nsophisticated models for SEDs suggest that the $>$29 GHz emission is\ncontributed by a combination of free-free emission from ionized gas, and\nthermal emission from optically thick and optically thin dust components.

We extract the raw light curves of\n3960 stars taken from the UCAC4 and EPIC catalogs and de-trend them for\nsystematic effects.

For detrended, TFA-corrected sources in\nthe 12--12.25 $\\rm K_{p}$ magnitude range, we achieve a best 6.5 hour window\nrunning rms of 35 ppm falling to 100 ppm for fainter stars in the 14--14.25 $\n\\rm K_{p}$ magnitude range.

Two scenarios have been\nsuggested for both phenomena: one of them involves rapid rotation and\nquasi-chemical homogeneous evolution (CHE), the other invokes classical\nevolution through mass loss in single and binary systems. WR spin rates might\nenable us to test these two scenarios. In order to obtain empirical constraints\non black hole progenitor spin, we infer wind asymmetries in all 12 known WR\nstars in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) at Z = 1/5 Zsun, as well as within a\nsignificantly enlarged sample of single and binary WR stars in the Large\nMagellanic Cloud (LMC at Z = 1/2 Zsun), tripling the sample of Vink (2007).\nThis brings the total LMC sample to 39, making it appropriate for comparison to\nthe Galactic sample. We measure WR wind asymmetries with VLT-FORS linear\nspectropolarimetry. We report the detection of new line effects in the LMC WN\nstar BAT99-43 and the WC star BAT99-70, as well as the famous WR/LBV HD 5980 in\nthe SMC, which might be evolving chemically homogeneously.

As WR mass loss is likely Z-dependent, our\nMagellanic Cloud line-effect WR stars may maintain their surface rotation and\nfulfill the basic conditions for producing long GRBs, both via the classical\npost-red supergiant (RSG) or luminous blue variable (LBV) channel, as well as\nresulting from CHE due to physics specific to very massive stars (VMS). \n\n"}

This is a topic that Zeeman-Doppler\nimaging (ZDI), a technique that is capable of reconstructing the large-scale\nmagnetic field topology of a star, can uniquely address.\n  Using a potential field source surface model, we estimate the open flux, mass\nloss-rate and angular momentum-loss rates for a sample of 66 stars that have\nbeen mapped with ZDI. We show that the open flux of a star is predominantly\ndetermined by the dipolar component of its magnetic field for our choice of\nsource surface radius. We also show that, on the main sequence, the open flux,\nmass- and angular momentum-loss rates increase with decreasing Rossby number.\nThe exception to this rule is stars less massive than $0.3M_{\\odot}$.

Testing the no-hair theorem has\nbeen a longstanding goal of gravitational-wave astronomy. The recent detection\nof gravitational waves from black hole mergers would seem to make such tests\nimminent.

Using data for 24 RRATs, we find that their period\nderivatives are generally larger than those of normal pulsars, independent of\nany intrinsic correlation with period, indicating that RRATs' highly sporadic\nemission may be associated with intrinsically larger magnetic fields.

This algorithm ensures manifest conservation of mass, energy,\nand momentum, and avoids imprinting 'preferred directions' on the ejecta. We\nshow that it is critical to incorporate both momentum and thermal energy of\nmechanical ejecta in a self-consistent manner, accounting for SNe cooling radii\nwhen they are not resolved. Using idealized simulations of single SN\nexplosions, we show that the FIRE-2 algorithm, independent of resolution,\nreproduces converged solutions in both energy and momentum. In contrast, common\n'fully-thermal' (energy-dump) or 'fully-kinetic' (particle-kicking) schemes in\nthe literature depend strongly on resolution: when applied at mass resolution\n>100 solar masses, they diverge by orders-of-magnitude from the converged\nsolution.

However we should ask: Do we expect to find\ntransients in these voids given our understanding of the various heating\nsources operating in astrophysical transients? In this work, we explore a broad\nrange of theoretical models and empirical relations to generate optical light\ncurves and to populate the duration-luminosity phase space (DLPS).

The algorithm considers a class of parameterized\nMRDs and finds the set of parameters that best fits the observed sample. The\nalgorithm consists of four parts. First, we define a new observable, the\n`modified mass function', that can be calculated for each binary in the sample.\nWe show that the distribution of the modified mass function follows the shape\nof the underlying MRD, turning it more advantageous than the previously used\nmass function, reduced mass function or reduced mass function logarithm.\nSecond, we derive the likelihood of the sample of modified mass functions to be\nobserved given an assumed MRD.

We argue that the process generating\ncircular polarisation must not be strongly wavelength dependent, and we propose\nthat the widespread presence of circular polarisation in our short wavelength\nsample dominated by blazars is mostly due to Faraday conversion of the linearly\npolarised synchrotron radiation in the helical magnetic field of the jet.\nCircular polarisation is variable, most notably on time scales comparable to or\nshorter than our median sampling interval <1 month. Longer time scales of about\none year are occasionally detected, but severely limited by the weakness of the\nsignal. At variance with some longer wavelength investigations we find that the\nsign of circular polarisation changes in most sources, while only 7 sources,\nincluding 3 already known, have a strong preference for one sign. The degrees\nof circular and linear polarisation do not show any systematic correlation. We\ndo find however one particular event where the two polarisation degrees vary in\nsynchronism during a time span of 0.9 years. The paper also describes a novel\nmethod for calibrating the sign of circular polarisation observations. \n\n"}

A view from dynamo theory Abstract: Recent data from the Kepler mission has revealed the occurrence of\nsuperflares in sun-like stars which exceed by far any observed solar flares in\nrelease of energy. A natural idea is that the dynamo mechanism in superflaring\nstars differs in some respect from that in the Sun. We search for a difference\nin the dynamo-related parameters between superflaring stars and the Sun to\nsuggest a dynamo-mechanism as close as possible to the conventional\nsolar/stellar dynamo but capable of providing much higher magnetic energy.\nDynamo based on joint action of differential rotation and mirror asymmetric\nmotions can in principle result in excitation of two types of magnetic fields.\nFirst of all, it is well-known in solar physics dynamo waves. The point is that\nanother magnetic configuration with initial growth and further stabilisation is\nalso possible for excitation. For comparable conditions, magnetic field\nstrength of second configuration is much larger rather of the first one just\nbecause dynamo do not spend its efforts for periodic magnetic field inversions\nbut use its for magnetic field growth. We analysed available data from the\nKepler mission concerning the superflaring stars in order to find tracers of\nanomalous magnetic activity. Starting from the recent paper, we find that\nanti-solar differential rotation or anti-solar sign of the mirror-asymmetry of\nstellar convection can provide the desired strong magnetic field in dynamo\nmodels. We confirm this concept by numerical models of stellar dynamos with\ncorresponding governing parameters.

Developing the weak field\napproximation, we find that the here derived equation of motion corresponding\nto Newton's equation also contains a small outwards acceleration term. The new\nterm is particularly significant for very low density systems.\n  A modified virial theorem is derived and applied to clusters of galaxies. For\nthe Coma and Abell 2029 clusters, the dynamical masses are about a factor of 5\nto 10 smaller than in the standard case. This tends to let no room for dark\nmatter in these clusters. Then, the two-body problem is studied and an equation\ncorresponding to the Binet equation is obtained. The results are applied to the\nrotation curve of the outer layers of the Milky Way.

Rotation critically influences\nthe mass of the exploding cores, the mass and chemical composition of the\nenvelopes and the types of supernovae, as well as the properties of the\nremnants and the chemical yields. In the formation of gamma-ray bursts,\nrotation and the properties of rotating stars appear as the key factor. In\nbinaries, the interaction between axial rotation and tidal effects often leads\nto interesting and unexpected results. Rotation plays a key role in shaping the\nevolution and nucleosynthesis in massive stars with very low metallicities\n(metallicity below about the Small Magellanic Cloud metallicity down to\nPopulation III stars). At solar and higher metallicities, the effects of\nrotation compete with those of stellar winds. In close binaries, the\nsynchronisation process can lock the star at a high rotation rate despite\nstrong mass loss and thus both effects, rotation and stellar winds, have a\nstrong impact. In conclusion, rotation is a key physical ingredient of the\nstellar models and of presupernova stages, and the evolution both of single\nstars and close binaries.

At fixed stellar mass, the red\nfraction is on average higher for satellites of red centrals than of blue\n(star-forming) centrals, a galactic conformity effect that increases with\ndensity. Most of the signal originates from groups that have the highest\nstellar mass, reside in the densest environments, and have massive, red only\ncentrals. Assuming a color-dependent halo-to-stellar-mass ratio, whereby red\ncentral galaxies inhabit significantly more massive halos than blue ones of the\nsame stellar mass, two regimes emerge more distinctly: at log(Mhalo/Msol) < 13,\ncentral quenching is still ongoing, conformity is no longer existent, and\nsatellites and group centrals exhibit the same quenching excess over field\ngalaxies at all mass and density, in agreement with the concept of \"group\nquenching\"; at log(Mhalo/Msol) > 13, a cutoff that sets apart massive\n(log(M*/Msol) > 11), fully quenched group centrals, conformity is meaningless,\nand satellites undergo significantly more quenching than their counterparts in\nsmaller halos.

Then,\non very general grounds, their evolution can be modelled with a Lindblad\nequation. This modified evolution leads to quantum decoherence of the system,\nas well as to corrections to observables such as the power spectrum of\ncurvature fluctuations. On one hand, current cosmological observations\nconstrain the properties of possible environments and place upper bounds on the\ninteraction strengths. On the other hand, imposing that decoherence completes\nby the end of inflation implies lower bounds on the interaction strengths.\nTherefore, the question arises of whether successful decoherence can occur\nwithout altering the power spectrum. In this paper, we systematically identify\nall scenarios in which this is possible. As an illustration, we discuss the\ncase in which the environment consists of a heavy test scalar field. We show\nthat this realises the very peculiar configuration where the correction to the\npower spectrum is quasi scale invariant. In that case, the presence of the\nenvironment improves the fit to the data for some inflationary models but\ndeteriorates it for others. This clearly demonstrates that decoherence is not\nonly of theoretical importance but can also be crucial for astrophysical\nobservations. \n\n"}

Our formalism uses tri-polar\nspherical harmonic decomposition with zero total angular momentum to compress\nthe 3D modes distribution in the redshift-space bispectrum.

We derive the expected systematic\nerror induced by the ionosphere. We compare our predictions with data from the\nLow Band Antenna (LBA) system of LOFAR. We show that we can isolate the\nionospheric effect in LOFAR LBA data and that our results are compatible with\nsatellite measurements, providing an independent way to measure the ionospheric\ntotal electron content (TEC). We show how the ionosphere also corrupts the\ncorrelated amplitudes through scintillations. We report values of the\nionospheric structure function in line with the literature. The systematic\nerrors on the phases of LOFAR LBA data can be accurately modelled as a sum of\nfour effects (clock, ionosphere 1st, 2nd, and 3rd order). This greatly reduces\nthe number of required calibration parameters, and therefore enables new\nefficient calibration strategies. \n\n"}

Simultaneous multiwavelength observations of the flux variations\nand their time correlations can play an important role in obtaining a better\nunderstanding of possible emission mechanisms and their origin. This paper\npresents observations of two flares that both apparently violate the previously\nestablished patterns in the relative timing of submm/NIR/X-ray flares from Sgr\nA*. One of these events provides the first evidence of coeval structure between\nNIR and submm flux increases, while the second event is the first example of\nthe sequence of submm/X-ray/NIR flux increases all occurring within ~1 hr. Each\nof these two events appears to upend assumptions that have been the basis of\nsome analytic models of flaring in Sgr A*. However, it cannot be ruled out that\nthese events, even though unusual, were just coincidental. These observations\ndemonstrate that we do not fully understand the origin of the multiwavelength\nvariability of Sgr A*, and show that there is a continued and important need\nfor long-term, coordinated, and precise multiwavelength observations of Sgr A*\nto characterize the full range of variability behavior. \n\n"}

During the first part of the outburst (MJD\n58004-58012), the source shows an optical-NIR spectrum that is consistent with\nan optically thin synchrotron power-law from a jet. After MJD 58015, however,\nthe source faded considerably, the drop in flux being much more evident at\nlower frequencies. Before the fading, we measure a de-reddened flux density of\n$\\gtrsim$100 mJy in the mid-infrared, making MAXI J1535-571 one of the\nbrightest mid-infrared BHBs known so far. A significant softening of the X-ray\nspectrum is evident contemporaneous with the infrared fade. We interpret it as\ndue to the suppression of the jet emission, similar to the accretion-ejection\ncoupling seen in other BHBs. However, MAXI J1535-571 did not transition\nsmoothly to the soft state, instead showing X-ray hardness deviations,\nassociated with infrared flaring. We also present the first mid-IR variability\nstudy of a BHB on minute timescales, with a fractional rms variability of the\nlight curves of $\\sim 15-22 \\%$, which is similar to that expected from the\ninternal shock jet model, and much higher than the optical fractional rms\n($\\lesssim 7 \\%$).

Previous work indicates that dynamical truncation and viscous\nevolution play a major role in determining circumstellar disk size and mass\ndistributions. However, it remains unclear under what circumstances each of\nthese two processes dominates. Here we present results of simulations of young\nstellar clusters taking viscous evolution and dynamical truncations into\naccount.

I focus on the evolution of the apparent spin frequency, which is\ntypically associated with the motion of a specific point on the stellar surface\n(e.g., polar cap). I start from long-term evolution (on the timescale when\ninstability significantly changes the spin frequency). For this case, I reduce\nevolution equations to one differential equation and demonstrate that it can be\ndirectly derived from energy conservation law. This equation governs evolution\nrate through sequence of thermally equilibrium states and provides linear\ncoupling for the cooling power and rotation energy losses via gravitational\nwave emission. In particular, it shows that differential rotation do not affect\nlong-term spin-down. On the contrary, on the short timescales, differential\nrotation can significantly modify the apparent spin-down, if one examines a\nstrongly unstable star with very small initial amplitude of unstable mode. This\nstatement is confirmed by consideration of Newtonian non-magnetized perfect\nfluid and dissipative stellar models as well as magnetized stellar model. For\nexample, despite that widely applied evolution equations predict effective spin\nto be constant in absence of dissipation, the CFS-unstable star should be\nobserved as spinning-down. However, effects of differential rotation on\napparent spin-down are negligible for realistic models of neutron star\nrecycling, unless: (1) the neutron star is not magnetized, and (2) r-mode\namplitude is modulated faster than the shear viscosity dissipation timescale,\nbeing large enough that spin-down can be measured on modulation timescale. \n\n"}

UGC 10214 is a very massive (stellar mass\n$M_{{\\rm \\star}}$ = $1.28\\times 10^{11}$$M_\\odot$) galaxy with a low gas\nfraction ($M_{{\\rm gas}}$/$M_{{\\rm \\star}}$ = 0.24), a high molecular gas\nfraction ($M_{{\\rm H}_2}$/$M_{\\rm HI}$ = 0.4) and a modest SFR (2-5 $M_\\odot$\nyr$^{-1}$). The comparison of the molecular gas mass and current SFR gives a\nmolecular gas depletion time of about $\\sim$ 2 Gyr (based on H$\\alpha$),\ncomparable to those of normal spiral galaxies. Both from a comparison of the\nH$\\alpha$ emission, tracing the current SFR, and far-ultraviolet (FUV)\nemission, tracing the recent SFR during the past tens of Myr, as well as from\nspectral energy distribution (SED) fitting with CIGALE, we find that the SFR\nhas increased by a factor of about 2-3 during the recent past. This increase is\nparticularly noticeable in the centre of the galaxy. A pixel-to-pixel\ncomparison of the SFR, molecular gas mass and stellar mass shows that the\ncentral region has had a depressed FUV-traced SFR, both compared to the\nmolecular gas and the stellar mass, whereas the H$\\alpha$-traced SFR shows a\nnormal level. The atomic and molecular gas distribution is asymmetric, but the\nposition-velocity diagram along the major axis shows a pattern of regular\nrotation. We conclude that the minor merger has most likely caused variations\nin the SFR in the past resulting in a moderate increase of the SFR, but it has\nnot perturbed the gas significantly so that the molecular depletion time\nremains normal. \n\n"}

If a filament has relatively low initial density, the\nradial contraction is slow due to less effective H2 cooling. This filament\ntends to fragment into dense clumps before the central density reaches\n$10^{8-9}$ cm$^{-3}$, where H2 cooling by three-body reactions is effective and\nthe fragment mass is more massive than some tens $M_\\odot$. In contrast, if a\nfilament is initially dense, the more effective H2 cooling with the help of\nthree-body reactions allows the filament to contract up to $n\\sim 10^{12}$\ncm$^{-3}$.

Traditionally, the continuum is\nobtained by a polynomial fitting truncating it at a lower order, and the mean\ntransmission is calculated over the entire wavelength range considered. The\nflux F is then normalized by the average of Fc e^{-tau}. However, the\nfluctuations in the transmitted flux are significantly correlated with the\nlocal background flux on scales for which the field is intermittent. In this\npaper, we develop a self-normalization algorithm of the transmission power\nspectrum based on a multiresolution analysis.

The galaxy consists of two main\ncomponents and several fainter knots. GRB 000926 occurred in the western\ncomponent, whereas most of the Ly-alpha luminosity (about 65%) originates in\nthe eastern component. Using archival HST images of the host galaxy we measure\nthe spectral slopes (f_lambda prop. to lambda^beta) of the two components to\nbeta = -2.4+-0.3 (east) and -1.4+-0.2 (west).

We do not\ndetect the host galaxy of GRB 000301C in neither Ly-alpha emission nor in U and\nI-band images. We infer a limit of U(AB)>27.7 (2-sigma limit per arcsec^2).

This is the most natural outcome of\nsupranova model where initially a supernova explosion takes place, leaving a\nsupra-massive NS, which loses its rotational energy over a time t_sd and\ncollapses to a BH, triggering a GRB explosion. We find that the time delay t_sd\nbetween the supernova and GRB events is the most important parameter that\ndetermines the behavior of the system. We consider the afterglow, prompt GRB\nand direct emission from the PWB. The observational signatures for different\nt_sd are described and joined together into one coherent framework. Constraints\non the model are derived for a spherical PWB, from the lack of detection of the\nPWB emission and afterglow observations. For very low values of t_sd<1 hr the\nsupranova model reduces to the collapsar model; 0.4<t_sd/1yr<1 is required to\nproduce the iron lines seen in some X-ray afterglows. However, we find that for\na spherical PWB, this implies no detectable radio afterglow, a small jet break\ntime and non-relativistic transition time, in disagreement with observations\nfor some of these GRBs. These discrepancies with the observations may be\nreconciled by resorting to a non-spherical geometry. We find that light element\nlines, recently detected in a few X-ray afterglows, are expected to dominate\nover iron lines for small t_sd, while for large t_sd the situation is reversed.\nFinally, we predict that external Compton scattering of the PWB photons by the\nafterglow relativistic electrons, should lead to high energy emission during\nthe early afterglow that may explain the GeV photons detected by EGRET in some\nGRBs, and should be detectable by future missions (GLAST). \n\n"}

This result is surprising within\nthe framework of internal shock models, since spectral shifts associated with\nthe jet's blue shift (by a Lorentz factor of Gamma) and the cosmological red\nshift (by a factor of 1+z) should cause substantial smearing in the\ndistribution of the spectral peak in the jet's co-moving frame, E_rest. For the\ngeneral case where the luminosity (L) varies as Gamma^N and E_rest varies as\nGamma^M, then the observed E_peak will vary as L^{(M+1)/N}(1+z)^{-1}. For two\nindependent set of 20 and 84 bursts, E_peak(1+z) varies as a power law of the\nluminosity with an index of (M+1)/N=0.36+-0.03. With this measured value, the\nabove functional dependence of E_peak on L and z results in E_peak being\nroughly constant for bursts of similar peak flux, P_256. Thus, the kinematic\nsmearing will be small, hence allowing the E_peak distribution to be narrow.\nThis model also predicts that bright bursts will have high E_peak values\nbecause they all have some combination of high luminosity (and hence a large\nblue shift Gamma) and a nearby distance (and hence a small cosmological red\nshift). Quantitatively, E_peak should vary roughly as P_256^0.36, and this\nmodel prediction is strikingly confirmed with BATSE data by Mallozzi et al. A\nprediction of this model is that GRBs at very high red shift z~10 should all\nappear with E_peak at ~200 keV. A further prediction of this model is that\nnormal bursts with P_256 below the BATSE trigger threshold will appear as x-ray\nflashes with E_peak~70 keV; just as is reported by Kippen et al. and Heise et\nal. \n\n"}

The angular and frequency domain fluctuations in this radiation\ncarry information about cosmological structure formation. We propose that\ncorrelations between visibilities measured at different baselines and\nfrequencies in radio-interferometric observations be used to quantify the\nstatistical properties of these fluctuations.

Using the\nSubmillimetre Common-User Bolometer Array (SCUBA) on the James Clerk Maxwell\nTelescope (JCMT), SHADES mapped two separate regions of sky: the\nSubaru/XMM-Newton Deep Field (SXDF) and the Lockman Hole East (LH). These SCUBA\nmaps cover 720 square arcmin with an RMS noise level of about 2 mJy and have\nuncovered >100 submillimetre galaxies. In order to ensure the utmost robustness\nof the resulting source catalogue, data reduction was independently carried out\nby four sub-groups drawn within the SHADES team, providing an unprecedented\ndegree of reliability with respect to other SCUBA catalogues available from the\nliterature.

The merging process is covered by\n270 outputs of a high resolution cosmological N-body simulation performed with\nthe ART (adaptive refinement tree) code. Some 2 Gyrs elapse between the first\nperi-centre passage of the progenitor cores and their final coalescence. During\nthat phase the cores experience six peri-centre passages with minimal distances\ndeclining from ~30 to ~2 kpc/h. The time intervals between the peri-centre\npassages continuously decrease from 9 to 1 times 10^8 yrs. We follow the mean\ndensity, the velocity dispersion and the entropy of the two progenitors within\na set of fixed proper radii (25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000 kpc/h). During the\nperi-centre passages we find sharp peaks of the mean densities within these\nradii, which exceed the sum of the corresponding progenitor densities. In\naddition to the intermixing of the merging haloes, the densities increase due\nto contraction caused by the momentary deepening of the potential well.

An optimal mass-selection\nrequires a quantitative understanding of the noise behavior in mass maps. This\npaper is an analysis of the noise properties in mass maps reconstructed using a\nmaximum likelihood method. The noise power spectrum and the mass error bars are\nderived as a straightforward extension of the Kaiser & Squires (1993) algorithm\nto the case of a correlated noise. A very good agreement is found between these\ncalculations and the noise properties observed in maximum likelihood mass\nreconstructions limited to simulated non-critical clusters of galaxies. In a\nsecond part, I show that the statistic of peaks in the noise follows accurately\nthe peak statistics of a two-dimensional Gaussian random field (using the BBKS\ntechnics) if the smoothing aperture contains enough galaxies. This analysis\nprovides a procedure to derive the significance of any mass peak as a function\nof its amplitude and its profile.
