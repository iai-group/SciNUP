The resulting ultra\nmetal-poor abundance distribution provided the initial conditions for the\nsecond stars of a wide range of initial masses reaching down to intermediate\nand low masses. The importance of these second stars for understanding the\norigin of the elements in the early universe are manifold. While the massive\nfirst stars have long vanished the second stars are still around and currently\nobserved. They are the carriers of the information about the first stars, but\nthey are also capable of nuclear production themselves. For example, in order\nto use ultra or extremely metal-poor stars as a probe for the r-process in the\nearly universe a reliable model of the s-process in the second stars is needed.\nEventually, the second stars may provide us with important clues on questions\nranging from structure formation to how the stars actually make the elements,\nnot only in the early but also in the present universe. In particular the\nC-rich extremely metal-poor stars, most of which show the s-process signature,\nare thought to be associated with chemical yields from the evolved giant phase\nof intermediate mass stars. Models of such AGB stars at extremely low\nmetallicity now exist, and comparison with observation show important\ndiscrepancies, for example with regard to the synthesis of nitrogen. This may\nhint at burning and mixing aspects of extremely metal-poor evolved stars that\nare not yet included in the standard picture of evolution, as for example the\nhydrogen-ingestion flash. The second stars of intermediate mass may have also\nplayed an important role in the formation of heavy elements that form through\nslow neutron capture reaction chains (s-process). Comparison of models with\nobservations reveal which aspects of the physics input and assumptions need to\nbe improved. The s-process is a particularly useful diagnostic tool for probing\nthe physical processes that are responsible for the creation of elements in\nstars, like for example rotation. As new observational techniques and\nstrategies continue to penetrate the field, for example the multi-object\nspectroscopy, or the future spectroscopic surveys, the extremely metal-poor\nstars will play an increasingly important role to address some of the most\nfundamental and challenging, current questions of astronomy. \n\n"}

In IRC +10420, the polarization of the Halpha line is\ndifferent to that of the continuum, which indicates that the\nelectron-scattering region is not spherically symmetric. The observed long term\nchanges in the polarimetry can be associated with an axi-symmetric structure,\nalong the short axis of the extended reflection nebulosity. Long term\nphotometry reveals that the star increased in temperature until the\nmid-nineties, after which the photospheric flux in the optical levelled off. As\nthe photometric changes are mostly probed in the red, they do not trace high\nstellar temperatures sensitively. And so, it is not obvious whether the star\nhas halted its increase in temperature or not. For HD 179821 we find no\npolarization effects across any absorption or emission lines, but observe very\nlarge polarization changes of order 5% over 15 years. Unexpectedly, during the\nsame period, the optical photometry displayed modest variability at the 0.2\nmagnitude level. Several explanations for this puzzling fact are discussed.\nMost of which, involving asymmetries in the circumstellar material, seem to\nfail as there is no evidence for the presence of hot, dusty material close to\nthe star. Alternatively, the variations can be explained by the presence of a\nnon-radially pulsating photosphere. Changes in the photometry hint at an\nincrease in temperature corresponding to a change through two spectral\nsubclasses over the past ten years. \n\n"}

We begin\nin this paper with a derivation of the self-force on a compact object moving in\nthe background spacetime of a supermassive black hole. The EFT approach\nutilizes the disparity between two length scales, which in this problem are the\nsize of the compact object and the radius of curvature of the background\nspacetime, to treat the orbital dynamics of the compact object, described as an\neffective point particle, separately from its tidal deformations. Ultraviolet\ndivergences are regularized using Hadamard's {\\it partie finie} to isolate the\nnon-local finite part from the quasi-local divergent part. The latter is\nconstructed from a momentum space representation for the graviton retarded\npropagator and is evaluated using dimensional regularization in which only\nlogarithmic divergences are relevant for renormalizing the parameters of the\ntheory. As a first important application of this framework we explicitly derive\nthe first order self-force given by Mino, Sasaki, Tanaka, Quinn and Wald. Going\nbeyond the point particle approximation, to account for the finite size of the\nobject, we demonstrate that for extreme mass ratio inspirals the motion of a\ncompact object is affected by tidally induced moments at $O(\\epsilon^4)$, in\nthe form of an Effacement Principle. The relatively large radius-to-mass ratio\nof a white dwarf star allows for these effects to be enhanced until the white\ndwarf becomes tidally disrupted, a potentially $O(\\epsilon^2)$ process, or\nplunges into the supermassive black hole. This work provides a new foundation\nfor further exploration of higher order self force corrections, gravitational\nradiation and spinning compact objects. \n\n"}

In particular, the arm-\nand looplike morphologies of the observed tidal debris can only be produced by\nthe kinematically cold material of the disk components of the accreted\ngalaxies. The tidal features that arise from such \"cold-accretion\" events onto\na massive elliptical are visible for significantly longer timescales than the\nfeatures produced by elliptical-elliptical mergers (about 1-2 Gyr vs. a few\nhundred million years). Mass ratios of the order of 1:10 between the accreting\nelliptical and the accreted disk are sufficient to match the brightness of the\nobserved debris. Furthermore, stellar population synthesis models and simple\norder-of-magnitude calculations indicate that the colors of the tidal features\ngenerated in such minor cold-accretion events are relatively red, in agreement\nwith the observations. The minor cold-accretion events that explain the\npresence, brightness, and structural and color properties of the tidal debris\ncause only a modest mass and luminosity increase in the accreting massive\nelliptical. These results, coupled with the relative statistical frequencies of\ndisk- and bulge-dominated galaxies in the field, suggest that massive\nellipticals assemble most of their mass well before their tidal debris forms\nthrough the accretion of relatively little, kinematically cold material rather\nthan in very recent, dissipationless major mergers. \n\n"}

Both of these methods have disadvantages that\nnegatively impact their accuracy in certain situations. We here propose a novel\nscheme which largely eliminates these weaknesses. It is based on a moving\nunstructured mesh defined by the Voronoi tessellation of a set of discrete\npoints. The mesh is used to solve the hyperbolic conservation laws of ideal\nhydrodynamics with a finite volume approach, based on a second-order unsplit\nGodunov scheme with an exact Riemann solver. The mesh-generating points can in\nprinciple be moved arbitrarily. If they are chosen to be stationary, the scheme\nis equivalent to an ordinary Eulerian method with second order accuracy. If\nthey instead move with the velocity of the local flow, one obtains a Lagrangian\nformulation of hydrodynamics that does not suffer from the mesh distortion\nlimitations inherent in other mesh-based Lagrangian schemes. In this mode, our\nnew method is fully Galilean-invariant, unlike ordinary Eulerian codes, a\nproperty that is of significant importance for cosmological simulations. In\naddition, the new scheme can adjust its spatial resolution automatically and\ncontinuously, and hence inherits the principal advantage of SPH for simulations\nof cosmological structure growth.

The spectrum can be fitted with a highly\nabsorbed hard X-ray component from an optically-thin hot plasma, a Gaussian\nemission line with an energy of 6.1 keV and a less absorbed soft thermal\ncomponent. The best fit is obtained with a model in which the hot component is\nproduced by optically thin thermal emission from an isobaric cooling flow with\na maximum temperature of 61 keV, which might be created inside an\noptically-thin boundary layer on the surface of the accreting with dwarf.

The high equivalent widths of the lines imply a high BLR covering\nfactor, and the absence of clear evidence for absorption by the BLR means that\nthe BLR has a flattened distribution and that we always view it near pole-on.\nThe BLR gas is strongly self-shielding near the equatorial plane.\nVelocity-resolved reverberation mapping has long strongly excluded significant\noutflow of the BLR and shows instead that the predominant motions are Keplerian\nwith large turbulence and a significant net inflow. The rotation and turbulence\nare consistent with the inferred geometry. The blueshifting of high-ionization\nlines is a consequence of scattering off inflowing material rather than the\nresult of an outflowing wind. The rate of inflow of the BLR is sufficient to\nprovide the accretion rate needed to power the AGN. Because the motions of the\nBLR are gravitationally dominated, and the BLR structure is very similar in\nmost AGNs, consistent black hole masses can be determined. The good correlation\nbetween these estimates and masses predicted from the bulge luminosities of\nhost galaxies provides strong support for the similarity of AGN continuum\nshapes and the correctness of the BLR picture presented. It is concluded that\nalthough many mysteries remain about the details of how AGNs work, a general\noverall picture of the torus and BLR is becoming clear. \n\n"}

This AGN-like source is known to feature three sets of\nemission lines at zem = 0.6972, 0.7020 and 0.7128. Different scenarios such as\na recoiling black hole after asymmetric emission of gravitational waves, binary\nblack holes and possible merging systems are proposed for this object. We test\nthese scenarios by comparing our spectra with that from the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey (SDSS), obtained 4 years prior to our observations. Comparing the\nredshifts of [OIII]4960,5008 we put a 3 sigma limit on the relative\nacceleration to be less than 32 km s^-1 yr^-1 between different emitting\nregions. Using the 2D spectra obtained at different position angles we show\nthat the [OIII]5008 line from the zem = 0.7128 component is extended beyond the\nspectral point spread function. We infer the linear extent of this line\nemitting region is ~8 kpc.

In a model where the\ntotal ionizing luminosity is divided equally between X-ray and EUV luminosity,\nwe find a photoevaporation rate of 1.4e-8 M_sun/yr, which is two orders of\nmagnitude greater than the case of EUV photoevaporation alone. Thus it is clear\nthat the X-rays are the dominant driving mechanism for photoevaporation. This\ncan be understood inasmuch as X-rays are capable of penetrating much larger\ncolumns (~1e22 cm^-2) and can thus effect heating in denser regions and at\nlarger radius than the EUV can. The radial extent of the launching region of\nthe X-ray heated wind is 1-70AU compared with the pure EUV case where the\nlaunch region is concentrated around a few AU. When we couple our wind\nmass-loss rates with models for the disc's viscous evolution, we find that, as\nin the pure EUV case, there is a photoevaporative switch, such that an inner\nhole develops at ~ 1 AU at the point that the accretion rate in the disc drops\nbelow the wind mass loss rate. At this point, the remaining disc material is\nquickly removed in the final 15-20% of the disc's lifetime. This is consistent\nwith the 1e5 yr transitional timescale estimated from observations of T-Tauri\nstars. We also caution that although our mass-loss rates are high compared to\nsome accretion rates observed in young stars, our model has a rather large\nX-ray luminosity of 2e30 erg/s; further modeling is required in order to\ninvestigate the evolutionary implications of the large observed spread of X-ray\nluminosities in T-Tauri stars. \n\n"}

In general it\nconsists of two parts, one independent of and another one proportional to the\nmean magnetic field. The first part may be nonzero only in the presence of mhd\nturbulence, maintained, e.g., by small-scale dynamo action. It corresponds to a\nbattery, which lets a mean magnetic field grow from zero to a finite value. The\nsecond part, which covers, e.g., the alpha effect, is important for large-scale\ndynamos. Only a few examples of the aforementioned first part of mean\nelectromotive force have been discussed so far. It is shown that a mean\nelectromotive force proportional to the mean fluid velocity, but independent of\nthe mean magnetic field, may occur in an originally homogeneous isotropic mhd\nturbulence if there are nonzero correlations of velocity and electric current\nfluctuations or, what is equivalent, of vorticity and magnetic field\nfluctuations.

We apply the approach to\nthe non-linear evolution of baryon and cold dark matter (CDM) perturbations,\nevolving from distinct sets of initial conditions. In current models of\nstructure formation, it is standard practice to treat baryons and CDM as an\neffective single component fluid. In this approximation, one uses a weighed sum\nof late-time baryon and CDM transfer functions to set initial conditions. Here,\nwe explore whether this approach can be used for high precision work. We show\nthat, even for a pure linear treatment, there is a large-scale scale-dependent\nbias between baryons and CDM for WMAP5 cosmology. This bias is >1% until the\npresent day, when it is driven towards unity through gravitational relaxation.\nUsing the RPT formalism we test this approximation in the non-linear regime,\nand show that the CDM power spectrum in the 2-component fluid differs from that\nobtained from a 1-component fluid by ~3% on scales of order k~0.05 h/Mpc at\nz=10, and by ~0.5% at z=0. However, for the case of baryons the situation is\nworse and we find that the power spectrum is suppressed by ~15% on scales\nk~0.05 h/Mpc at z=10, and by ~3-5% at z=0, relative to the total matter.\nImportantly, besides the suppression of the spectrum, baryonic acoustic\noscillations (BAO) are amplified for baryon and damped for CDM spectra. Thus,\nhigh precision modeling of baryons can not be probed through CDM only\nsimulations; detection significance of BAO will be amplified in probes that\nstudy baryonic matter.

We use empirical halo occupation constraints to\npopulate halos with galaxies and determine the distribution of normal and\nmerging galaxies. Each system can then be associated with high-resolution\nhydrodynamic simulations. We predict the distribution of observed luminosities\nand SFRs, from different galaxy classes, as a function of redshift from z=0-6.\nWe provide fitting functions for the predicted LFs, quantify the uncertainties,\nand compare with observations. At all redshifts, 'normal' galaxies dominate the\nLF at moderate luminosities ~L* (the 'knee'). Merger-induced bursts\nincreasingly dominate at L>>L*; at the most extreme luminosities, AGN are\nimportant. However, all populations increase in luminosity at higher redshifts,\nowing to increasing gas fractions. Thus the 'transition' between normal and\nmerger-dominated sources increases from the LIRG-ULIRG threshold at z~0 to\nbright Hyper-LIRG thresholds at z~2. The transition to dominance by obscured\nAGN evolves similarly, at factor of several higher L_IR. At all redshifts,\nnon-merging systems dominate the total luminosity/SFR density, with\nmerger-induced bursts constituting ~5-10% and AGN ~1-5%. Bursts contribute\nlittle to scatter in the SFR-stellar mass relation. In fact, many systems\nidentified as 'ongoing' mergers will be forming stars in their 'normal'\n(non-burst) mode.

While extended emission is detected in the majority of the sources, about\n7% of the sources exhibit only radio core emission. Many BL Lacs exhibit\nextended radio power and kpc-scale morphology typical of powerful FRII jets,\nwhile a substantial number of quasars possess radio powers intermediate between\nFRIs and FRIIs. This poses challenges to the simple radio-loud unified scheme,\nwhich links BL Lacs to FRIs and quasars to FRIIs. We find a significant\ncorrelation between extended radio emission and pc-scale jet speeds: the more\nradio powerful sources possess faster jets. This indicates that the 1.4 GHz (or\nlow frequency) radio emission is indeed related to jet kinetic power. Various\nproperties such as extended radio power and apparent pc-scale jet speeds vary\nsmoothly between different blazar subclasses, suggesting that, at least in\nterms of radio jet properties, the distinction between quasars and BL Lac\nobjects, at an emission-line equivalent width of 5 Angstrom is essentially an\narbitrary one. Based on the assumption that the extended radio luminosity is\naffected by the kpc-scale environment, we define the ratio of extended radio\npower to absolute optical magnitude as a proxy for environmental effects.\nTrends with this parameter suggest that the pc-scale jet speeds and the\npc-to-kpc jet misalignments are not affected by the large-scale environment,\nbut are more likely to depend upon factors intrinsic to the AGN, or its local\npc-scale environment. We suggest that some of the extremely misaligned MOJAVE\nblazar jets could be \"hybrid\" morphology sources, with an FRI jet on one side\nand an FRII jet on the other. (Abridged) \n\n"}

However, inferences about galaxy\npopulation properties are in practice limited by 'cosmic variance'. This is the\nuncertainty in observational estimates of the number density of galaxies\narising from the underlying large-scale density fluctuations. This source of\nuncertainty can be significant, especially for surveys which cover only small\nareas and for massive high-redshift galaxies. Cosmic variance for a given\ngalaxy population can be determined using predictions from cold dark matter\ntheory and the galaxy bias. In this paper we provide tools for experiment\ndesign and interpretation. For a given survey geometry we present the cosmic\nvariance of dark matter as a function of mean redshift z and redshift bin size\nDz. Using a halo occupation model to predict galaxy clustering, we derive the\ngalaxy bias as a function of mean redshift for galaxy samples of a given\nstellar mass range. In the linear regime, the cosmic variance of these galaxy\nsamples is the product of the galaxy bias and the dark matter cosmic variance.\nWe present a simple recipe using a fitting function to compute cosmic variance\nas a function of the angular dimensions of the field, z, Dz and stellar mass\nm*.

For\ngalaxies of m*~10^10 Msun the relative cosmic variance is ~19% for GOODS, ~13%\nfor GEMS and ~6% for COSMOS.

A\n  Recovery Method for the Delay Time Distribution Abstract: The supernova (SN) delay-time distribution (DTD) - the SN rate versus time\nthat would follow a brief burst of star formation - can shed light on SN\nprogenitors, and on chemical enrichment timescales. Previous attempts to\nrecover the DTD have used comparisons of mean SN rates vs. redshift to cosmic\nstar-formation history (SFH), or comparison of SN rates among galaxies of\ndifferent mean ages. We present an approach to recover the SN DTD that avoids\nsuch averaging. We compare the SFHs of individual galaxies to the numbers of\nSNe discovered in each galaxy (generally zero, sometimes one or a few SNe). We\napply the method to a subsample of 3505 galaxies, hosting 82 SNe Ia and 119\ncore-collapse SNe (CC SNe), from the Lick Observatory SN Search (LOSS), with\nSFHs reconstructed from SDSS spectra. We find a >2sigma SN Ia DTD signal in our\nshortest-delay, \"prompt\", bin at <420 Myr. Despite a systematic error, due to\nthe limited aperture of the SDSS spectroscopic fibres, which causes some of the\nprompt signal to leak to the later DTD bins, the data require prompt SNe Ia at\nthe >99% confidence. We further find, at 4sigma, SNe Ia that are \"delayed\" by >\n2.4 Gyr. Thus, the data support the existence of both prompt and delayed SNe\nIa. The time integral over the CC SN DTD is 0.010+/-0.002 SNe per Msun, as\nexpected if all stars of mass >8 Msun lead to visible SN explosions. This\nargues against a minimum mass for CC SNe of >10 Msun, and against a significant\nfraction of massive stars that collapse without exploding.

The deep spectra available allowed us to measure\nthe Oxygen abundances (12 + log (O/H)) using the \"Empirical method\" based on\nintensities of the strongest emission lines, and the \"Direct method\", based on\nthe determination of the electron temperature from the detection of weak\nauroral lines, as the [OIII] at 4363 Angstrom. The Oxygen abundance measured\nfor the polar disk is then compared with those measured for different galaxy\ntypes of similar total luminosities, and then compared against the predictions\nof different polar ring formation scenarios. The average metallicity values for\nthe polar disk in NGC 4650A is Z=0.2 Zsun, and it is lower that the values\nmeasured for ordinary spirals of similar luminosity. Moreover the gradient of\nthe metallicity is flat along the polar disk major axis, which implies none or\nnegligible metal enrichment from the stars in the older central spheroid. The\nlow metallicity value in the polar disk NGC 4650A and the flat metallicity\ngradient are both consistent with a later infall of metal-poor gas, as expected\nin the cold accretion processes. \n\n"}

The large wavelength range of these observations and the\navailability of spectroscopic redshifts allow us to unambiguously identify the\npeak of the redshifted thermal emission from dust at ~ 300um.

This suggests that these galaxies are not high redshift\nanalogues of the Hyper-LIRGs/ULIRGs used in local templates, but are instead\n\"scaled up\" versions of local ULIRGs/LIRGs. For both galaxies the star\nformation rate determined from the best-fit FIR SEDs (SFR(L_{IR})) agrees with\nthe SFR determined from the dust corrected H-alpha luminosity (SFR(H-alpha)) to\nwithin a factor of ~ 2; however, when the SFR of these galaxies is estimated\nusing only the observed 24um flux and the standard luminosity-dependent\ntemplate method (SFR(24um)), it systematically overestimates the SFR by as much\nas a factor of 6. A larger sample of 24 K-selected galaxies at z ~ 2.3 drawn\nfrom the Kriek et al. (2008) GNIRS sample shows the same trend between\nSFR(24um) and SFR(H-alpha).

Lya radiative transfer substantially modifies the intrinsic Lya\nemission properties, compared to observed ones, depending on the density and\nvelocity structure environment around the Lya emitting galaxy.

We confirmed that there is a self-regulating\nmechanism that maintains the amplitude of the spiral arms.

Since the amplitude itself is limited by the value of\n$Q$, this makes the dynamical heating less effective in the later phase of\nevolution.

In the case of a smaller number of particles, e.g.,\n$3\\times 10^5$, spiral arms grow faster in the beginning of the simulation\n(while $Q$ is small) and they cause a rapid increase of $Q$.

Moreover, observations show that the UV luminosities and\nstellar masses grow from z=8 to 3, implying that the SFRs increase with time.\nWe compare the cosmologically averaged evolution in galaxies at 3 < z < 8 at\nconstant comoving number density, n = 2 x 10^-4 Mpc^-3. This allows us to study\nthe evolution of stellar mass and star formation in the galaxy predecessors and\ndescendants in ways not possible using galaxies selected at constant stellar\nmass or SFR, quantities that evolve strongly in time. We show that the average\nSFH of these galaxies increase smoothly from z=8 to 3 as SFR ~ t^alpha with\nalpha = 1.7 +/- 0.2. This conflicts with assumptions that the SFR is either\nconstant or declines exponentially in time. We show that the stellar mass\ngrowth in these galaxies is consistent with this derived SFH. This provides\nevidence that the slope of the high-mass end of the IMF is approximately\nSalpeter unless the duty cycle of star formation is much less than unity. We\nargue that these relations follow from gas accretion (either through accretion\nor delivered by mergers) coupled with galaxy disk growth under the assumption\nthat the SFR depends on the local gas surface density. This predicts that gas\nfractions decrease from z=8 to 3 on average as f_gas ~ (1+z)^0.9 for galaxies\nwith this number density. The implied galaxy gas accretion rates at z > 4 are\nas fast and may even exceed the SFR: this is the \"gas accretion epoch\". At z <\n4 the SFR overtakes the implied gas accretion rate, indicating a period where\ngalaxies consume gas faster than it is acquired. At z < 3, galaxies with this\nnumber density depart from these relations implying that star formation and gas\naccretion are slowed at later times. \n\n"}

We\nshow that such a delay can arise even in bright quasars for purely dynamical\nreasons. If some large-scale process produces rapid inflow, smaller scales will\nquickly become gas-dominated. As the gas density peaks, so does the SFR.\nHowever, gravitational torques which govern further inflow are relatively\ninefficient in gas-dominated systems; as more gas is turned into stars, the\nstars provide an efficient angular momentum sink allowing more rapid inflow.\nMoreover, the gas provided to the central regions in mergers or strong disk\ninstabilities will typically be ~100 times larger than that needed to fuel the\nBH; the system is effectively in the 'infinite gas supply' limit. BH growth can\ntherefore continue for some time while the gas supply exhausts, until it has\nsignificantly depleted to the point where the BH is finally 'starved.'

The\nstatistical equilibrium calculations, performed under the assumption of the\nSobolev approximation using the radiative transfer code TORUS, has been\nimproved to include He I and He II energy levels.

In both cases, the model produces line profiles which are\nqualitatively similar to those found in observations. Our models are consistent\nwith the scenario in which the narrow blueshifted absorption component of He I\n(10830) seen in observations is caused by a disc wind, and the wider\nblueshifted absorption component (the P-Cygni profile) is caused by a bipolar\nstellar wind.

Emission features in the soft X-ray\nspectrum of the bright extended emission (L[0.3-2keV]~10^40 erg/s) at r>130 pc\n(2\") are consistent with the brighter OVII, OVIII, and NeIX lines seen in the\nChandra HETGS and XMM-Newton RGS spectra below 2 keV.

Self-consistent\nphotoionization models provide good descriptions of the spectra of the large\nscale emission, as well as resolved structures, supporting the dominant role of\nnuclear photoionization, although displacement of optical and X-ray features\nimplies a more complex medium. Collisionally ionized emission is estimated to\nbe <12% of the extended emission.

We study the impact of this effect on\nthe star formation history of galaxies. We incorporate metallicity-dependent\nstar formation and metal enrichment in a simple model that follows the\nevolution of a halo main progenitor. Our model shows that including the effect\nof metallicity leads to suppression of star formation at redshift z>2 in dark\nhalos with masses <~ 10^11 Msun, with the suppression becoming near total for\nhalos below ~10^9.5-10 Msun. We find that at high redshift the SFR cannot catch\nup with the gas inflow rate (IR), because the SFR is limited by the free-fall\ntime, and because it is suppressed further by a lack of metals. As a result, in\neach galaxy the SFR is growing in time faster than the IR, and the integrated\ncosmic SFR density is rising with time. The suppressed in situ SFR at high z\nmakes the growth of stellar mass dominated by ex situ SFR which implies that\nthe specific SFR (sSFR) remains constant with time. The intensely accreted gas\nat high z is accumulating as an atomic gas reservoir. This provides additional\nfuel for star formation in 10^10 - 10^12 Msun halos at z ~ 1-3, which allows\nthe SFR to exceed the instantaneous IR, and may enable an even higher outflow\nrate. At z<1, following the natural decline in IR with time due to the\nuniversal expansion, the SFR and sSFR are expected to drop. We specify the\nexpected dependence of sSFR and metallicity on stellar mass and redshift. At a\ngiven z, and below a critical mass, these relations are predicted to be flat\nand rising respectively.

JCs in the galaxy center heat up their MACHOs by tidal\nforces, which makes them expand, so that coagulation and star formation occurs.\nBeing continuously fed by matter from bypassing JCs, the central star(s) may\ntransform into a super massive black hole. It has a fast $t^3$ growth during\nthe first mega years, and a slow $t^{1/3}$ growth at giga years. JCs disrupted\nby a close encounter with this black hole can provide matter for the bulge.\nThose that survive can be so agitated that they form stars inside them and\nbecome globular star clusters.

Classical bulges are thought to form by\ngalactic merger with bursty star formation, whereas pseudobulges are suggested\nto form by secular evolution due to spiral arms and a barred structure\nfunneling gas into the galactic centre. Noguchi (1998,1999) suggested another\nbulge formation scenario, `clump-origin bulge'. He demonstrated using a\nnumerical simulation that a galactic disc suffers dynamical instability to form\nclumpy structures in the early stage of disc formation since the premature disc\nis expected to be highly gas-rich, then the clumps are sucked into the galactic\ncentre by dynamical friction and merge into a single bulge at the centre. This\nbulge formation scenario, which is expected to happen only at the\nhigh-redshift, is different from the galactic merger and the secular evolution.\nTherefore, clump-origin bulges may have their own unique properties.

The gravitational energy released by the mass inflow down\nthe gravitational potential gradient drives the disc turbulence that maintains\nthe disc unstable with a Toomre instability parameter Q~1, compensating for the\ndissipative losses of the gas turbulence and raising the stellar velocity\ndispersion. We follow the velocity dispersion of stars and gas as they heat and\ncool respectively and search for disc `stabilization', to be marked by a low\ngas velocity dispersion comparable to the speed of sound ~10 km/s. We vary the\nmodel parameters that characterize the accreted gas fraction, turbulence\ndissipation rate, star-formation rate, and stellar feedback. We find that as\nlong as the gas input roughly follows the average cosmological rate, the disc\ninstability is a robust phenomenon at high redshift till z~1, driven by the\nhigh surface density and high gas fraction due to the intense cosmological\naccretion. For a broad range of model parameter values, the discs tend to\n`stabilize' at z~0-0.5 as they become dominated by hot stars. When the model\nparameters are pushed to extreme values, the discs may stabilize as early as\nz~2, with the gas loss by strong outflows serving as the dominant stabilizing\nfactor. \n\n"}

Theoretical studies encounter difficulties in\nexplaining their formation and origin. Here we propose a novel scenario for the\nproduction of planetary systems at such orbits, through the dynamical recapture\nof free floating planets (FFPs) in dispersing stellar clusters. This process is\na natural extension of the recently suggested scenario for the formation of\nwide stellar binaries. We use N-body simulations of dispersing clusters with\n10-1000 stars and comparable numbers of FFPs to study this process. We find\nthat planets are captured into wide orbits in the typical range ~100-10^6 AU,\nand have a wide range of eccentricities (thermal distribution). Typically, 3-6\nx (f_FFP/1) % of all stars capture a planetary companion with such properties\n(where f_FFP is the number of FFP per star). The planetary capture efficiency\nis comparable to that of capture-formed stellar-binaries, and shows a similar\ndependence on the cluster size and structure. It is almost independent of the\nspecific planetary mass; planets as well as sub-stellar companions of any mass\ncan be captured. The capture efficiency decreases with increasing cluster size,\nand for a given cluster size the it increases with the host/primary mass. More\nthan one planet can be captured around the same host and planets can be\ncaptured into binary systems. Planets can also be captured into pre-existing\nplanetary and into orbits around black holes and massive white dwarfs, if these\nformed early enough before the cluster dispersal. In particular, stellar black\nholes have a high capture efficiency (>50 % and 5-10 x (f_FFP/1) % for capture\nof stars and planetary companions, respectively) due to their large mass.\nFinally, although rare, two FFPs or brown dwarfs can become bound and form a\nFFP-binary system with no stellar host. \n\n"}

The former result from\nthe direct collapse of gas in T_s^h >1.5x10^4K, H_2-free halos; the latter are\nthe endproduct of a standard H_2-based star formation process. The H_2-free\ncondition is attained by exposing halos to a strong (J_21 > 10^3) Lyman-Werner\nUV background produced by both accreting BHs and stars, thus establishing a\nself-regulated growth regime. We find that this condition is met already at z\nclose to 18 in the highly biased regions in which quasars are born. The key\nparameter allowing the formation of SMBHs by z=6-7 is the fraction of halos\nthat can form heavy seeds: the minimum requirement is that f_heavy>0.001; SMBH\nas large as 2x10^10 Msol can be obtained when f_heavy approaches unity.\nIndependently of f_heavy, the model produces a high-z stellar bulge-black hole\nmass relation which is steeper than the local one, implying that SMBHs formed\nbefore their bulge was in place. The formation of heavy seeds, allowed by the\nLyman-Werner radiative feedback in the quasar-forming environment, is crucial\nto achieve a fast growth of the SMBH by merger events in the early phases of\nits evolution, i.e. z>7. The UV photon production is largely dominated by stars\nin galaxies, i.e. black hole accretion radiation is sub-dominant.\nInterestingly, we find that the final mass of light BHs and of the SMBH in the\nquasar is roughly equal by z=6; by the same time only 19% of the initial baryon\ncontent has been converted into stars. The SMBH growth is dominated at all\nepochs z > 7.2 by mergers (exceeding accretion by a factor 2-50); at later\ntimes accretion becomes by far the most important growth channel.

Because too much mass is heated, the\ntemperatures are too low and the cooling times too short. We use analytic\narguments to estimate, as a function of the gas density and the numerical\nresolution, the minimum heating temperature that is required for the injected\nthermal energy to be efficiently converted into kinetic energy.

First, with standard star formation and supernova\nfeedback prescriptions, we find that the mean baryonic fraction value estimated\nat the virial radius of the two main central objects (i.e. the Milky Way and\nAndromeda) is decreasing over time, and is 10-15% lower than the universal\nvalue, 0.166, at z=0. This decrease is mainly due to the fact that the amount\nof accretion of dissipative gas onto the halo, especially at low redshift, is\nin general much lower than that of the dissipationless dark matter. Indeed, a\nsignificant part of the baryons does not collapse onto the haloes and remains\nin their outskirts, mainly in the form of warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM).\nMoreover, during the formation of each object, some dark matter and baryons are\nalso expelled through merger events via tidal disruption. In contrast to\nbaryons, expelled dark matter can be more efficiently re-accreted onto the\nhalo, enhancing both the reduction of fb inside Rv, and the increase of the\nmass of WHIM outside Rv. Varying the efficiency of supernovae feedback at low\nredshift does not seem to significantly affect these trends. Alternatively,\nwhen a significant fraction of the initial gas in the main objects is released\nat high redshifts by more powerful sources of feedback, such as AGN from\nintermediate mass black holes in lower mass galaxies, the baryonic fraction at\nthe virial radius can have a lower value (fb~0.12) at low redshift. Hence\nphysical mechanisms able to drive the gas out of the virial radius at high\nredshifts will have a stronger impact on the deficit of baryons in the mass\nbudget of Milky Way type-galaxies at present times than those that expel the\ngas in the longer, late phases of galaxy formation. \n\n"}

In this paper we\npropose a novel type of dark matter detector: detectors made of DNA or RNA\ncould provide nanometer resolution for tracking, an energy threshold of 0.5\nkeV, and can operate at room temperature. When a WIMP from the Galactic Halo\nelastically scatters off of a nucleus in the detector, the recoiling nucleus\nthen traverses hundreds of strings of single stranded nucleic acids (ssNA) with\nknown base sequences and severs ssNA strands along its trajectory.

Thus the path of the\nrecoiling nucleus can be tracked to nanometer accuracy.

We find that a circular binary system with a\nmisaligned circumbinary disk normally produces a double peaked\nmass-accretion-rate variation per binary orbit. This is because each black hole\npasses across the circumbinary disk plane and captures gas twice in one orbital\nperiod.

We expect the jet's acceleration to produce a GW\nMemory signal. While all relativistic jet models display anti-beaming of GW\nradiation away from the jet axis, thus radiating away from directions of GRBs'\ngamma radiation, this effect is not overwhelming. The decrease of the signal\namplitude towards the cone of gamma-ray detectability is weak, and for some\nmodels and parameters the GW signal reaches a significant amplitude for much of\nthe gamma-ray cone. Thus both signals may be jointly detected. We find\ndifferent waveforms and fourier signatures for uniform jets and structured jet\nmodels - thus offering a method of using GW signatures to probe the internal\nstructure and acceleration of GRB jets. The GW signal peaks just outside the\njet (core) of a uniform (structuted) jet. Within the jet (core) the GW signal\ndisplays wiggles, due to a polarization effect; thus for a uniform jet, the\npeak amplitude accompanies a smoother signal than the peak of a structured jet.\nFor the most probable detection angle and for typical GRB parameters, we expect\nfrequencies < ~600Hz and amplitudes h~10^-25. Our estimates of the expected\nsignals suggest that the signals are not strong enough for a single cluster of\nDECIGO nor for aLIGO's sensitivities. However, sensitivies of ~10^-25/sqrt(Hz)\nin the DECIGO band should suffice to detect typical long GRBs at 2Gpc and short\nGRBs at 200Mpc, implying a monthly event of a long GRB and a detection of a\nshort GRB every decade.

In extensions of the standard model allowing for the\npresence of DeltaNnu equivalent neutrinos (or dark radiation), Neff is\ngenerally >3. The canonical results are reconsidered here, revealing that a\nmeasurement of Neff>3 can be consistent with DeltaNnu=0 (dark radiation without\ndark radiation). Conversely, a measurement consistent with Neff=3 is not\ninconsistent with the presence of dark radiation (DeltaNnu>0). In particular,\nif there is a light WIMP that annihilates to photons after the SM neutrinos\nhave decoupled, the photons are heated beyond their usual heating from e+-\nannihilation, reducing the late time ratio of neutrino and photon temperatures\n(and number densities), leading to Neff<3. This opens the window for one or\nmore equivalent neutrinos, including sterile neutrinos, to be consistent with\nNeff=3. By reducing the neutrino number density at present, this allows for\nmore massive neutrinos, relaxing the current constraints on the sum of the\nneutrino masses. In contrast, if the light WIMP only couples to the SM\nneutrinos and not to the photons, its late time annihilation heats the\nneutrinos but not the photons, resulting in Neff>3 even in the absence of\nequivalent neutrinos or dark radiation. A measurement of Neff>3 is thus no\nguarantee of the presence of equivalent neutrinos or dark radiation. In the\npresence of light WIMPs and/or equivalent neutrinos there are degeneracies\namong the light WIMP mass and its nature (fermion or boson, as well as its\ncouplings to neutrinos or photons), the number and nature (fermion or boson) of\nthe equivalent neutrinos, and their decoupling temperature (the strength of\ntheir interactions with the SM particles).

Instead, this torque-limited accretion model yields black\nholes and galaxies evolving on average along the observed scaling relations by\nrelying only on a fixed, 5% mass retention rate onto the black hole from the\nradius at which the accretion flow is fed.

The\nstrength of the field along the line of sight is found to be between 47 and 331\nmG in the H$_2$O maser region. Extrapolating this result to the surface of the\nstars, assuming a toroidal field ($\\propto$ r$^{-1}$), we find magnetic fields\nof 0.3-6.9 G on the stellar surfaces. If, instead of a toroidal field, we\nassume a poloidal field ($\\propto$ r$^{-2}$), then the extrapolated magnetic\nfield strength on the stellar surfaces are in the range between 2.2 and\n$\\sim$115 G. Finally, if a dipole field ($\\propto$ r$^{-3}$) is assumed, the\nfield strength on the surface of the star is found to be between 15.8 and\n$\\sim$1945 G. The magnetic energy of our sources is higher than the thermal and\nkinetic energy in the H$_2$O maser region of this class of objects. This leads\nus to conclude that, indeed, magnetic fields probably play an important role in\nshaping the outflows of evolved stars. (abridged) \n\n"}

The\n  Turbulent Stirring Recipe Abstract: Turbulence in protoplanetary disks affects planet formation in many ways.\nWhile small dust particles are mainly affected by the aerodynamical coupling\nwith turbulent gas velocity fields, planetesimals and larger bodies are more\naffected by gravitational interaction with gas density fluctuations. For the\nlatter process, a number of numerical simulations have been performed in recent\nyears, but a fully parameter-independent understanding has not been yet\nestablished. In this study, we present simple scaling relations for the\nplanetesimal stirring rate in turbulence driven by magnetorotational\ninstability (MRI), taking into account the stabilization of MRI due to Ohmic\nresistivity. We begin with order-of-magnitude estimates of the\nturbulence-induced gravitational force acting on solid bodies and associated\ndiffusion coefficients for their orbital elements. We then test the predicted\nscaling relations using the results of recent Ohmic-resistive MHD simulations\nby Gressel et al.

We have used\nexisting, high quality optical and radio data from the SDSS and ALFALFA surveys\nto investigate the relationship between redshifts derived from optical\nspectroscopy and neutral hydrogen (HI) spectral line observations. We find that\nthe two redshift measurements agree well, with a negligible systematic offset\nand a small distribution width.

The width of the stacked profile is dominated by the width\ndistribution of the input individual profiles when the redshift errors are less\nthan the median width of the input profiles, and only when the redshift errors\nbecome large, ~150 km/s, do they significantly affect the width of the stacked\nprofile.

Only the outermost ejecta layers with free-expansion\nvelocities larger than about 18,000 km/s have been shocked so far in this\ndynamically young, likely Type Ia SNR. A long (980 ks) Chandra observation in\n2011 allowed spatially-resolved spectroscopy of heavy-element ejecta. We\ndenoised Chandra data with the spatio-spectral method of Krishnamurthy et al.,\nand used a wavelet-based technique to spatially localize thermal emission\nproduced by intermediate-mass elements (IMEs: Si and S) and iron. The spatial\ndistribution of both IMEs and Fe is extremely asymmetric, with the strongest\nejecta emission in the northern rim. Fe Kalpha emission is particularly\nprominent there, and fits with thermal models indicate strongly oversolar Fe\nabundances. In a localized, outlying region in the northern rim, IMEs are less\nabundant than Fe, indicating that undiluted Fe-group elements (including 56Ni)\nwith velocities larger than 18,000 km/s were ejected by this SN. But in the\ninner west rim, we find Si- and S-rich ejecta without any traces of Fe, so\nhigh-velocity products of O-burning were also ejected.

We find that, with\nthe currently measured proper motions and radial velocity of M31, MOND would\nimply that the Milky Way and M31 first moved apart via Hubble expansion after\nbirth, but then necessarily got attracted again by the Milgromian gravitational\nattraction, and had a past fly-by encounter before coming to their present\npositions. This encounter would most probably have happened 7 to 11 Gyr ago\n(0.8<z<3). The absence of a dark matter halo and its associated dynamical\nfriction is necessary for such a close encounter not to trigger a merger.\nObservational arguments which could exclude or favour such a past encounter\nwould thus be very important in view of falsifying or vindicating Milgromian\ndynamics on the scale of the Local Group.

Taking into account the non conservative\nevolution of the system due to mass loss from an accretion disk as a result of\npropeller action and from the companion via ablation by the pulsar, the\ntransition from the accretion powered to rotation powered phase is\ninvestigated. It is shown that the operation of the propeller and ablation\nmechanisms can be responsible for the formation and evolution of black widow\nmillisecond pulsar systems from the low mass X-ray binary phase at an orbital\nperiod of ~0.1 day. For a range of population synthesis input parameters, the\nresults reveal that a population of black widow millisecond pulsars\ncharacterized by orbital periods as long as ~0.4 days and companion masses as\nlow as ~0.005 Msun can be produced.

To do this, two classes of massive (M* >= 10^10.5 Msun) galaxy are\nselected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Munich semi-analytic\nmodel of galaxy formation, L-Galaxies. The first class is selected by high\nspecific star formation rates (sSFR) and high Zg, and the second class by low\nsSFR and low Zg. These criteria roughly distinguish disc-dominant galaxies from\nmetal-poor, elliptical galaxies. In the semi-analytic model, the second class\nof galaxies obtain low sSFR and low Zg due to gradual dilution of the\ninterstellar medium by accretion of metal-poor gas via infalling clumps and\nlow-mass satellites. This occurs after a merger-induced starburst and the\nassociated supernova feedback have quenched most of the original gas reservoir.\nA number of signatures of this evolution are present in these model galaxies at\nz=0, including low gas fractions, large central black holes, elliptical\nmorphologies, old ages, and importantly, low (Zg-Z*) indicating dilution after\nstar formation.

We show how the integrated\nspectra (`global profiles') of a variety of galaxy models depend on the spatial\ndistribution of the tracer gas as well as its velocity dispersion. We\ndemonstrate that the choice of tracer emission line significantly affects the\nshape of the global profiles. In particular, in the case of high (~50 kms-1)\nvelocity dispersions, compact tracers (such as CO) result in Gaussian-like\n(non-double-horned) profiles, as is indeed frequently seen in high-redshift\nobservations.

The emergence\nof these self-consistent fields make shear flows significant sites for\nradiation emission and particle acceleration. We focus on electron-scale\ninstabilities, namely the collisionless, unmagnetized Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability (KHI) and a large-scale dc magnetic field generation mechanism on\nthe electron scales. We show that these processes are important candidates to\ngenerate magnetic fields in the presence of strong velocity shears, which may\nnaturally originate in energetic matter outburst of active galactic nuclei and\ngamma-ray bursters. We show that the KHI is robust to density jumps between\nshearing flows, thus operating in various scenarios with different density\ncontrasts. Multidimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of the KHI,\nperformed with OSIRIS, reveal the emergence of a strong and large-scale dc\nmagnetic field component, which is not captured by the standard linear fluid\ntheory.

It is shown that, in EE, a positive dark energy density requires a\nLagrangian leading to quantum ghosts, whereas VT is free from these ghosts. On\naccount of this fact, the remainder of the paper is devoted to study cosmology\nin the framework of VT. Initial conditions, at high redshift, are used to solve\nthe evolution equations of all the VT scalar modes. In particular, a certain\nscalar mode characteristic of VT -which does not appear in general relativity\n(GR)- is chosen in such a way that it evolves separately. In other words, the\nscalar modes of the standard model based on GR do not affect the evolution of\nthe VT characteristic mode; however, this scalar mode influences the evolution\nof the standard GR ones.

Large and regular glitches observed in the\nVela pulsar have originally constrained the fraction of the stellar moment of\ninertia that must reside in the solid crust to about 1.4%. However, crustal\nentrainment-which until very recently has been ignored-suggests that in order\nto account for the Vela glitches, the fraction of the moment of inertia\nresiding in the crust must increase to about 7%. This indicates that the\nrequired angular momentum reservoir may exceed that which is available in the\ncrust. We explore the possibility that uncertainties in the equation of state\nprovide enough flexibility for the construction of models that predict a large\ncrustal thickness and consequently a large crustal moment of inertia. Given\nthat analytic results suggest that the crustal moment of inertia is sensitive\nto the transition pressure at the crust-core interface, we tune the parameters\nof the model to maximize the transition pressure, while still providing an\nexcellent description of nuclear observables. In this manner we are able to\nobtain fractional moments of inertia as large as 7% for neutron stars with\nmasses below 1.6 solar masses.

For a massive scalar field in a fixed de Sitter background,\nthe cosmic no-hair theorem implies that the state of the patch approaches the\nvacuum, where there are no fluctuations. We argue that an analogous conclusion\nholds whenever a patch of de Sitter is embedded in a larger theory with an\ninfinite-dimensional Hilbert space, including semiclassical quantum gravity\nwith false vacua or complementarity in theories with at least one Minkowski\nvacuum. This reasoning provides an escape from the Boltzmann brain problem in\nsuch theories.

One of the most important pieces\nof information comes from the chemical composition of primary particles. It is\nwell known that the muon content of air showers generated by the interaction of\ncosmic rays with the atmosphere is rather sensitive to primary mass. Therefore,\nthe measurement of the number of muons at ground level is an essential\ningredient to infer the cosmic ray mass composition. In this work we present a\nnew method for reconstructing the muon lateral distribution function with an\narray of segmented counters. The energy range from .4 to 2.5 EeV is considered.\nFor a triangular array spaced at 750 m we found that 450 m is the optimal\ndistance to evaluate the number of muons. The corresponding statistical and\nsystematic uncertainties of the new and of a previous reconstruction methods\nare compared. Since the statistical uncertainty of the new reconstruction is\nless than in the original one, the power to discriminate between heavy and\nlight cosmic ray primaries is enhanced.

Using Omega25, a\nsuite of cosmological simulations that incorporate both dark matter and gas\ndynamics with differing treatments of gas cooling, star formation, and thermal\nfeedback, we systematically explore the physics that governs cosmic accretion\ninto halos and their galaxies. Physically meaningful cosmic accretion of both\ndark matter and baryons occurs at z > 1 across our halo mass range: M_200m =\n10^{11-14} M_sun. However, dark matter, because it is dissipationless, is\ndeposited (in a time-average sense) at > R_200m(z) in a shell-like manner, such\nthat dark-matter mass and density experience little-to-no physical growth at\nany radius within a halo at z < 1. In contrast, gas, because it is able to cool\nradiatively, experiences significant accretion at all radii, at a rate that\nroughly tracks the accretion rate at R_200m, at all redshifts. Infalling gas\nstarts to decouple from dark matter at ~2 R_200m and continues to accrete to\nsmaller radii until the onset of strong angular-momentum support at ~ 0.1\nR_200m. Thus, while the growth of dark matter is subject to pseudo-evolution,\nthe growth of baryons is not. The fact that the accretion rate of gas on\ngalactic scales tracks the accretion rate near R_200m provides insight into the\ntight relations between the masses/sizes of galaxies and those of their host\nhalos across cosmic time. \n\n"}

If the density parameter $\\Omega_m$ or the dark energy equation of\nstate $w$ are incorrectly chosen, the gradient field appears to be anisotropic\nwith the degree of anisotropy varying with redshift.

Although oxygen is an important tracer of Galactic chemical\nevolution, measurements of its abundance in the atmospheres of the oldest\nGalactic stars are still scarce and rather imprecise. At the lowest end of the\nmetallicity scale, oxygen can only be measured in giant stars and in most of\ncases such measurements rely on a single forbidden [O I] 630 nm line that is\nvery weak and frequently blended with telluric lines. Although molecular OH\nlines located in the ultraviolet and infrared could also be used for the\ndiagnostics, oxygen abundances obtained from the OH lines and the [O I] 630 nm\nline are usually discrepant to a level of ~0.3-0.4 dex. Aims. We study the\ninfluence of convection on the formation of the infrared (IR) OH lines and the\nforbidden [O I] 630 nm line in the atmospheres of extremely metal-poor (EMP)\nred giant stars. Methods. We used high-resolution and high signal-to-noise\nratio spectra of four EMP red giant stars obtained with the VLT CRIRES\nspectrograph. For each EMP star, 4-14 IR OH vibrational-rotational lines\nlocated in the spectral range of 1514-1548 and 1595-1632 nm were used to\ndetermine oxygen abundances by employing standard 1D LTE abundance analysis\nmethodology.

We find that the\ninfluence of convection on the formation of [O I] 630 nm line in the\natmospheres of EMP giants studied here is minor, which leads to very small\n3D-1D abundance corrections (< -0.01 dex). On the contrary, IR OH lines are\nstrongly affected by convection and thus the abundance corrections for these\nlines are significant, 3D-1D ~ -0.2 ... -0.3 dex.

Additional MIRC-only observations were performed to track the\norbital motion of the companion, and these were fit together with new and\nexisting radial velocity measurements of both stars to derive the complete\norbital elements and distance. The hot subdwarf companion is clearly detected\nin the near-IR data at each epoch of observation with a flux contribution of\n1.5% in the H band, and restricted fits indicate that its flux contribution\nrises to 3.3% in the visible. A new binary orbital solution is determined by\ncombining the astrometric and radial velocity measurements. The derived stellar\nmasses are 9.6+-0.3Msol and 1.2+-0.2Msol for the Be primary and subdwarf\nsecondary, respectively. The inferred distance (186 +- 3 pc), kinematical\nproperties, and evolutionary state are consistent with membership of phi Persei\nin the alpha Per cluster. From the cluster age we deduce significant\nconstraints on the initial masses and evolutionary mass transfer processes that\ntransformed the phi Persei binary system. The interferometric data place strong\nconstraints on the Be disk elongation, orientation, and kinematics, and the\ndisk angular momentum vector is coaligned with and has the same sense of\nrotation as the orbital angular momentum vector. The VEGA visible continuum\ndata indicate an elongated shape for the Be star itself, due to the combined\neffects of rapid rotation, partial obscuration of the photosphere by the\ncircumstellar disk, and flux from the bright inner disk. \n\n"}

A comparison of the angular resolution obtained by the two\noperational gamma-ray instruments, AGILE-GRID and Fermi-LAT, is interesting in\nview of future gamma-ray missions, that are currently under study. The two\ninstruments exploit different detector configurations affecting the angular\nresolution: the former being optimized in the readout and track reconstruction\nespecially in the low-energy band, the latter in terms of converter thickness\nand power consumption. We show that, despite these differences, the angular\nresolution of both instruments is very similar between 100 MeV and a few GeV. \n\n"}

We suggest that these types may\nbe imprinted by the early conditions of formation rather than being only the\nresult of a recent morphological transformation driven by environmental\neffects. We present precise star formation histories of a sample of Local Group\ndwarf galaxies, derived from colour-magnitude diagrams reaching the oldest\nmain-sequence turnoffs. We argue that these galaxies can be assigned to two\nbasic types: fast dwarfs that started their evolution with a dominant and short\nstar formation event, and slow dwarfs that formed a small fraction of their\nstars early and have continued forming stars until the present time (or\nalmost). These two different evolutionary paths do not map directly onto the\npresent-day morphology (dwarf spheroidal vs dwarf irregular). Slow and fast\ndwarfs also differ in their inferred past location relative to the Milky Way\nand/or M31, which hints that slow dwarfs were generally assembled in lower\ndensity environments than fast dwarfs. We propose that the distinction between\na fast and slow dwarf galaxy reflects primarily the characteristic density of\nthe environment where they form.

We show that these particles appear at\ndensities close to twice saturation density and must be therefore included in\nthe calculations of the hadronic equation of state. Such an early appearance is\nstrictly related to the value of the L parameter of the symmetry energy that\nhas been found, in recent phenomenological studies, to lie in the range\n$40<L<62$ MeV. We discuss also the threshold for the formation of deltas and\nhyperons for hot and lepton rich hadronic matter. Similarly to the case of\nhyperons, also delta resonances cause a softening of the equation of state\nwhich makes it difficult to obtain massive hadronic stars. Quark stars, on the\nother hand, can reach masses up to $2.75 M_{\\odot}$ as predicted by\nperturbative QCD calculations.

We consider in detail a contribution\nfrom a standard blackbody accretion disc, testing whether its inner radius can\nbe set equal to that of the reflector. However, this leads to an unphysical\nbehaviour of the disc truncation radius, implying the soft X-ray component is\nnot a standard blackbody disc. This appears to be due to irradiation by the\nhard X-rays, which strongly dominate the total emission. We consider a large\narray of models, testing, e.g., the effects of the chosen energy range, of\nadding unblurred reflection, and assuming a lamppost geometry.

Previous formulations\nusing reproducing kernel (RK) interpolation have had difficulties maintaining\nconservation of momentum due to the fact the RK kernels are not, in general,\nspatially symmetric. Here, we utilize a reformulation of the fluid equations\nsuch that mass, linear momentum, and energy are all rigorously conserved\nwithout any assumption about kernel symmetries, while additionally maintaining\napproximate angular momentum conservation. Our approach starts from a\nrigorously consistent interpolation theory, where we derive the evolution\nequations to enforce the appropriate conservation properties, at the sacrifice\nof full consistency in the momentum equation. Additionally, by exploiting the\nincreased accuracy of the RK method's gradient, we formulate a simple limiter\nfor the artificial viscosity that reduces the excess diffusion normally\nincurred by the ordinary SPH artificial viscosity.

Historical UV observations have ruled out orbital variability as an\nexplanation for flickering and instead suggest flickering is caused by variable\nmass transfer. We have analysed optical and X-ray observations to investigate\nthe nature of the flickering as well as the active phases in T CrB. The\nspectroscopic and photometric observations confirm that the active phases\nfollow two periods of ~1000d and ~5000d. Flickering in the X-rays is detected\nand follows an amplitude-flux relationship similar to that observed in the\noptical. The flickering is most prominent at harder X-ray energies, suggesting\nthat it originates in the boundary layer between the accretion disc and the\nwhite dwarf. The X-ray radiation from the boundary layer is then reprocessed by\na thick accretion disc or a nebula into UV radiation. A more detailed\nunderstanding of flickering would benefit from long-term simultaneous X-ray and\noptical monitoring of the phenomena in symbiotic recurrent novae and related\nsystems such as Z And type symbiotic stars. \n\n"}

Emphasis was given on their properties and the\nobservational selection effects when observing and detecting them. In this work\nwe analysed in this work six models, including three with Kroupa distributions\nof the initial binaries. We found that for models with Kroupa initial\ndistributions, considering the standard value of the efficiency of the common\nenvelope phase adopted in BSE, no single cataclysmic variable was formed only\nvia binary stellar evolution, i. e., in order to form them, strong dynamical\ninteractions have to take place. We show and explain why this is inconsistent\nwith observational and theoretical results. Our results indicate that the\npopulation of cataclysmic variables in globular clusters is, mainly, in the\nlast stage of their evolution and observational selection effects can\ndrastically change the expected number of observed cataclysmic variables.

Abstract: Simulations of cosmological filamentary accretion reveal flows (\"streams\") of\nwarm gas, ~$10^4$ K, which are efficient in bringing gas into galaxies. We\npresent a phenomenological scenario where gas in such flows -- if it is shocked\nas it enters the halo as we assume -- become biphasic and, as a result,\nturbulent. We consider a collimated stream of warm gas that flows into a halo\nfrom an over dense filament of the cosmic web. The post-shock streaming gas\nexpands because it has a higher pressure than the ambient halo gas, and\nfragments as it cools. The fragmented stream forms a two phase medium: a warm\ncloudy phase embedded in hot post-shock gas. We argue that the hot phase\nsustains the accretion shock. A fraction of the initial kinetic energy of the\ninfalling gas is converted into turbulence among and within the warm clouds.\nThe thermodynamic evolution of the post-shock gas is largely determined by the\nrelative timescales of several processes -- the cooling, the expansion of the\npost-shock gas, the amount of turbulence in the clouds, and the halo dynamics.\nWe expect the gas to become multiphase when the cooling and dynamical times are\nof the same order-of-magnitude. In this framework, we show that this occurs in\nthe important mass range of ~$10^{11}$ to $10^{13}$ M$_\\odot$ , where the bulk\nof stars have formed in galaxies. Gas accreting along cosmic web filaments may\neventually lose coherence and mix with the ambient halo gas.

De-collimating flows make the\ndirect interaction between galaxy feedback and accretion streams more likely,\nthereby further reducing the overall accretion efficiency. Moderating the gas\naccretion efficiency through these mechanisms may help to alleviate a number of\nsignificant challenges in theoretical galaxy formation. \n\n"}

As the most comprehensive statistics, this PDF encodes all\ncosmological information of large-scale modes, therefore, could serve as the\nbasis in the LSS modelling. Following the so-called PDF-based method from\nturbulence, we write down this PDF's evolution equation, which describes the\nprobability conservation. We show that this conservation equation's\ncharacteristic curves follow the same PDF history and could be considered as an\neffective dynamics of the coarse-grained field. Unlike the EFT of LSS, which\nconceptually would work at both realization and statistics level, this\neffective dynamics is valid only statistically. However, this `statistical\nequivalence' also provides valuable insight into scale interactions at the\nstatistical level. It also enables predicting a wide variety of statistics\nbeyond the typical N-point polyspectra, including, e.g. topologies, density PDF\nand non-linear covariance matrices etc. Our formula expresses the small-scale\neffect as the ensemble average of their interactions conditional on the\nlarge-scale modes.

Magnetic fields\nsuppress shear instabilities at the galaxy-ICM interface, and magnetized tails\nare smoother and narrower than tails in comparable hydrodynamic simulations in\nVijayaraghavan & Ricker (2015). Orbiting galaxies stretch and amplify ICM\nmagnetic fields, amplifying magnetic power spectra on $10 - 100$ kpc scales.\nGalaxies inject turbulent kinetic energy into the ICM via their turbulent wakes\nand $g$-waves.

The\ninitial conditions of the molecular cloud establish its dynamical history until\nthe stellar cluster is born.

The\n\\textit{Spitzer} data exhibit finite-source effects due to the passage of the\nlens close to or directly over the surface of the source star as seen from\n\\textit{Spitzer}. Such finite-source effects generally yield measurements of\nthe angular Einstein radius, which when combined with the microlens parallax\nderived from a comparison between the ground-based and the \\textit{Spitzer}\nlight curves, yields the lens mass and lens-source relative parallax.

The column density of OVI\nis typically enhanced by $\\approx 0.3-1.0$ dex at impact parameters within\n$0.3R_{\\rm vir}$, and by $\\approx 0.06-0.2$ dex at $2R_{\\rm vir}$, thereby also\nenhancing the covering fraction of OVI above a given column density threshold.\nThe fossil effect tends to increase with increasing AGN luminosity, and towards\nshorter AGN lifetimes and larger AGN duty cycle fractions. In the limit of\nshort AGN lifetimes, the effect converges to that of a continuous AGN with a\nluminosity of $(f_{\\rm duty}/100\\%)$ times the AGN luminosity.

We analyze the satellite alignment (SA) signal based on\nthree shape measurement methods (re-Gaussianization, de Vaucouleurs, and\nisophotal shapes), which trace galaxy light profiles at different radii. The\nmeasured SA signal depends on these shape measurement methods. We detect the\nstrongest SA signal in isophotal shapes, followed by de Vaucouleurs shapes.\nWhile no net SA signal is detected using re-Gaussianization shapes across the\nentire sample, the observed SA signal reaches a statistically significant level\nwhen limiting to a subsample of higher luminosity satellites. We further\ninvestigate the impact of noise, systematics, and real physical isophotal\ntwisting effects in the comparison between the SA signal detected via different\nshape measurement methods. Unlike previous studies, which only consider the\ndependence of SA on a few parameters, here we explore a total of 17 galaxy and\ncluster properties, using a statistical model averaging technique to naturally\naccount for parameter correlations and identify significant SA predictors.

We provide a description of the\nconstruction of the NORAS II galaxy cluster survey based on X-ray data from the\nnorthern part of the ROSAT All-Sky Survey. NORAS II extends the NORAS survey\ndown to a flux limit of 1.8 x 10^(-12) erg s^-1 cm^-2 (0.1 - 2.4 keV)\nincreasing the sample size by about a factor of two. The NORAS II cluster\nsurvey now reaches the same quality and depth of its counterpart, the Southern\nREFLEX II survey, allowing us to combine the two complementary surveys. The\npaper provides information on the determination of the cluster X-ray\nparameters, the identification process of the X-ray sources, the statistics of\nthe survey, and the construction of the survey selection function, which we\nprovide in numerical format. Currently NORAS II contains 860 clusters with a\nmedian redshift of z = 0.102.

The same physical arguments as in Paper\nI are applied to these models, i.e. only a small deviation of the spin estimate\nfrom $a=1$, $a\\gtrsim 1$, is assumed for a favoured model. For five of these\nmodels that involve Keplerian and radial epicyclic oscillations we find the\nexistence of a unique specific QPO excitation radius.

OzDES is a multi-object spectroscopic survey\ntargeting multiple types of targets at multiple epochs over a multi-year\nbaseline, and is one of the first multi-object spectroscopic surveys to\ndynamically include transients into the target list soon after their discovery.\nAt the end of three years, OzDES has spectroscopically confirmed almost 100\nsupernovae, and has measured redshifts for 17,000 objects, including the\nredshifts of 2,566 supernova hosts.

It is thus difficult to use the information encoded in small\nscales to test cosmological models or probe subtle features of the galaxy-halo\nconnection. In this paper, we attempt to push halo modelling into the\n\"accurate\" regime with a fully numerical mock-based methodology and careful\ntreatment of statistical and systematic errors. With our forward-modelling\napproach, we can incorporate clustering statistics beyond the traditional\ntwo-point statistics. We use this modelling methodology to test the standard\n$\\Lambda\\mathrm{CDM}$ + halo model against the clustering of SDSS DR7 galaxies.\nSpecifically, we use the projected correlation function, group multiplicity\nfunction and galaxy number density as constraints. We find that while the model\nfits each statistic separately, it struggles to fit them simultaneously. Adding\ngroup statistics leads to a more stringent test of the model and significantly\ntighter constraints on model parameters. We explore the impact of varying the\nadopted halo definition and cosmological model and find that changing the\ncosmology makes a significant difference. The most successful model we tried\n(Planck cosmology with Mvir halos) matches the clustering of low luminosity\ngalaxies, but exhibits a 2.3$\\sigma$ tension with the clustering of luminous\ngalaxies, thus providing evidence that the \"standard\" halo model needs to be\nextended.

Due to\nthese perturbative effects, the stellar binaries in dense environments are\nlikely to experience mergers, collisions or ejections through secular and/or\nnon-secular interactions. More direct interactions with the central SMBH are\nthought to produce hypervelocity stars (HVSs) and tidal disruption events\n(TDEs). In this paper, we use N-body simulations to study the dynamics of\nstellar binaries orbiting a central SMBH primary with an outer SMBH secondary\norbiting this inner triple. The effects of the secondary SMBH on the event\nrates of HVSs, TDEs and stellar mergers are investigated, as a function of the\nSMBH-SMBH binary mass ratio. Our numerical experiments reveal that, relative to\nthe isolated SMBH case, the TDE and HVS rates are enhanced for, respectively,\nthe smallest and largest mass ratio SMBH-SMBH binaries. This suggests that the\nobserved event rates of TDEs and HVSs have the potential to serve as a\ndiagnostic of the mass ratio of a central SMBH-SMBH binary. The presence of a\nsecondary SMBH also allows for the creation of hypervelocity binaries.\nObservations of these systems could thus constrain the presence of a secondary\nSMBH in the Galactic Centre. \n\n"}

In this paper, we improve the algorithm by\neliminating accretion gaps, boosting momentum feedback, and introducing a\nsubgrid initial bound fraction, $f_i$, that distinguishes cluster mass from\nstellar particle mass. We perform a suite of simulations with different star\nformation efficiency per freefall time $\\epsilon_{\\rm ff}$ and supernova\nmomentum feedback intensity $f_{\\rm boost}$. We find that the star formation\nhistory of a Milky Way-sized galaxy is sensitive to $f_{\\rm boost}$, which\nallows us to constrain its value, $f_{\\rm boost}\\approx5$, in the current\nsimulation setup.

Past studies have shown that cosmic microwave\nbackground and large-scale structure constraints rule out $\\gtrsim 5\\%$ of the\ndark matter to behave in this manner. However, we show that, even with percent\nlevel mass fractions, a dark atomic sector could affect some extragalactic and\ngalactic observables.

Unlike the baryons,\nwhere stellar feedback (driven by nuclear physics) delays the formation and\ngrowth of galaxies, cooling dark atomic gas typically results in disks forming\nearlier, leaving more time for their destruction via mergers.

The outer part of this\ncollapse remains optically thin, and has been studied intensively using\nnumerical simulations. However, the innermost region of the collapse is\nexpected to become optically thick and requires us to follow the radiation\nfield in order to understand its subsequent evolution. So far, the adiabatic\napproximation has been used exclusively for this purpose. We apply radiative\ntransfer in the flux-limited diffusion (FLD) approximation to solve the\nevolution of coupled gas and radiation, for isolated halos. For direct collapse\nwithin isolated DM halos, we find that (1) the photosphere forms at ~10^{-6} pc\nand rapidly expands outward. (2) A central core forms, with a mass of ~1 Mo,\nsupported by thermal gas pressure gradients and rotation. (3) Growing thermal\ngas and radiation pressure gradients dissolve it. (4) This process is\nassociated with a strong anisotropic outflow, and another core forms nearby and\ngrows rapidly. (5) Typical radiation luminosity emerging from the photosphere\nencompassing these cores is ~5 x 10^{37}-5 x 10^{38} erg/s, of order the\nEddington luminosity. (6) Two variability timescales are associated with this\nprocess: a long one, which is related to the accretion flow within the central\n~10^{-4}-10^{-3} pc, and ~0.1 yr, which is related to radiation diffusion.

The expanding envelope absorbs most of the gravitational energy that is\nreleased by the spiraling-in process of the secondary star inside the common\nenvelope, and so it is the hydrogen recombination energy that is behind most of\nthe luminosity increase of the system. The recombination energy of hydrogen\nadds only a small fraction of the energy required to remove the common\nenvelope, and hence does not play a significant role in the ejection of the\nenvelope. \n\n"}

While\nthe hot WHIM is hard to detect due to its high ionisation level, the warm\n(T$\\lesssim10^{5.5}$ K) phase of the WHIM has been very robustly detected in\nthe FUV band. We adopted the assumption that the hot and warm WHIM phases are\nco-located and thus used the FUV-detected warm WHIM as a tracer for the\ncosmologically interesting hot WHIM. We utilised the assumption by performing\nan X-ray follow-up in the sight line of a blazar PKS 2155-304 at the redshifts\nwhere previous FUV measurements of OVI, SiIV and BLA absorption have indicated\nthe existence of the warm WHIM.

The ultra-relativistic\nSunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) decrement measures the electron number and not the\nenergy content. On the other hand, the relativistic SZ increment at higher\nfrequencies depends strongly on the spectral shape of the electrons. We\ncalculate the expected Comptonization due to the energy release of radio\ngalaxies, which we estimate to be 3 10^66 erg Gpc^-3. We investigate\nComptonization from (a) the part of the released energy which is thermalized\nand (b) the relativistic, remnant radio plasma, which may form a second,\nrelativistic phase in the inter galactic medium, nearly unobservable for\npresent day instruments (presence of so called 'radio ghosts'). We find a\nthermal Comptonization parameter due to (a) of y = 10^-6 and (b) an optical\ndepth of relativistic electrons in old radio plasma of tau_rel < 10^-7. If a\nsubstantial fraction of the volume of clusters of galaxies is filled with such\nold radio plasma the SZ effect based determination of the Hubble constant is\nbiased to lower values.

The PNe with warm dust emission\nrepresent a homogeneous population, which is presumably young and minimally\naffected by a possible dependence of PN lifetime on progenitor mass. The sample\nin paper I thus allows testing the predictions of single star evolution,\nthrough a comparison with synthetic distributions and under the assumption that\ntip-of-the-AGB and PN statistics are similar. We construct a schematic model\nfor AGB evolution (adapted from Groenewegen & de Jong 1993), whose\nfree-parameters are calibrated with the luminosity function (LF) of C stars in\nthe LMC, the initial-final mass relation, and the range of PN compositions. The\nobserved metallicity gradient and distribution of star forming regions with\ngalactocentric radius (Bronfman et al. 2000) allow us to synthesise the\ngalactic disk PN progenitor population. We find the fraction of O-rich PNe,\nf(O), is a tight constraint on AGB parameters. For our best model, a minimum PN\nprogenitor mass Mmin=1Msun predicts that about 50% of all young PNe should be\nO-rich, compared to an observed fraction of 22%; thus Mmin=1.2Msun, at a 2sigma\nconfidence level. By contrast, current AGB models for single stars can account\nneither for the continuous range of N enrichment (Leisy & Dennefeld 1996), nor\nfor the observation that the majority of very C-rich PNe have Peimbert type I\n(paper I). f(O) is thus an observable much easier to model.

We report the discovery of a short-lived radio flare within\nthe X-ray localization error circle of this burst. Such radio flares are seen\nin about 25% of GRB afterglows and their origin is not well understood. The\nprecise radio position enabled us to identify the likely host galaxy of this\nburst, and to measure its redshift, z = 0.9578. The host appears to be an\ninteracting/merging system. Under the assumption that the X-ray afterglow is\nmainly due to synchrotron mechanism we infer the optical afterglow flux. The\nobserved upper limits to the optical flux are easily explained by invoking an\nintervening dusty cloud within the host galaxy.

The object, which we call \"PALS1\", was found in a\nsurvey aimed at identifying highly-magnified Lyman-break galaxies in the fields\nof intervening rich clusters. At discovery, the source had U>24.7 (2-sigma;\nAB), g=21.96, and very blue g-r and r-i colors; i.e., PALS1 was a U-band\ndrop-out, characteristic of star-forming galaxies and quasars at z~3. However,\nthree months later the source had faded by more than three magnitudes. Further\nobservations showed a continued decline in luminosity, to R>26.4 seven months\nafter discovery. Though the apparent brightness is suggestive of a supernova at\nroughly the cluster redshift, we show that the photometry and light curve argue\nagainst any known type of supernova at any redshift. The spectral energy\ndistribution and location near the center of a galaxy cluster are consistent\nwith the hypothesis that PALS1 is a gravitationally-lensed transient at z~3.3.\nIf this interpretation is correct, the source is magnified by a factor of 4-7\nand two counterimages are predicted. Our lens model predicts time delays\nbetween the three images of 1-10 years and that we have witnessed the final\noccurrence of the transient. The intense luminosity (M(AB) ~ -23.5 after\ncorrecting for lensing) and blue UV continuum (implying T>50,000 K) argue the\nsource may have been a flare resulting from the tidal disruption of a star by a\n10^6-10^8 solar-mass black hole.

We first argue\nthat the hole's rotation necessarily limits the radial extent of the force-free\nlink on the disk surface: the faster the hole rotates, the smaller the\nmagnetically-connected inner part of the disk has to be. We then show that this\nis indeed the case by solving numerically the Grad--Shafranov equation--the\nmain differential equation describing the structure of the magnetosphere. An\nimportant element in our approach is the use of the regularity condition at the\ninner light cylinder to fix the poloidal current as a function of the poloidal\nmagnetic flux.

We review the effects of irradiation and evaporation on the evolution\nof short period planets and argue that substantial mass loss may have occurred\nfor these objects. Concerning star formation, geometrical effects in protostar\ncore collapse are examined by comparing 1D and 3D calculations. Spherical\ncollapse is shown to overestimate the core inner density and temperature and\nthus to yield incorrect initial conditions for PMS or young brown dwarf\nevolution. Accretion is also shown to occur over a very limited fraction of the\nprotostar surface. Accretion affects the evolution of young brown dwarfs and\nyields more compact structures for a given mass and age, thus fainter\nluminosities. This can lead to severe misinterpretations of the mass and/or age\nof young accreting objects from their location in the HR diagram. We argue that\nnewborn stars and brown dwarfs should appear rapidly over an extended area in\nthe HR diagram, depending on their accretion history, rather than on a well\ndefined birth line.

Assuming that the\nintrinsic photon index of AGN is 2, we then use the 30 keV intensity of the XRB\nto infer the absorption-corrected energy density of the background. Soltan's\nargument then enables us to convert this to a mean local density in black\nholes, assuming an accretion efficiency of 0.1 and a mean AGN redshift of 2.\nThe result is within a factor of two of that estimated by Haehnelt et al from\nthe optically-determined black hole masses of Magorrian et al.

II: Probing Post-Post-Newtonian metrics Abstract: We study gravitational lensing by compact objects in gravity theories that\ncan be written in a Post-Post-Newtonian (PPN) framework: i.e., the metric is\nstatic and spherically symmetric, and can be written as a Taylor series in m/r,\nwhere m is the gravitational radius of the compact object. Working invariantly,\nwe compute corrections to standard weak-deflection lensing observables at first\nand second order in the ratio of the angular gravitational radius to the\nangular Einstein ring radius of the lens. We show that the first-order\ncorrections to the total magnification and centroid position vanish universally\nfor gravity theories that can be written in the PPN framework. This arises from\nsome surprising, fundamental relations among the lensing observables in PPN\ngravity models. We derive these relations for the image positions,\nmagnifications, and time delays. A deep consequence is that any violation of\nthe universal relations would signal the need for a gravity model outside the\nPPN framework (provided that some basic assumptions hold). In practical terms,\nthe relations will guide observational programs to test general relativity,\nmodified gravity theories, and possibly the Cosmic Censorship conjecture.

At sufficiently\nhigh density, such matter is made of up, down and strange quarks in the\ncolor-flavor locked phase, with no electrons. As a function of increasing\ndensity (or, perhaps, increasing depth in a compact star) other phases may\nintervene between these two phases which are guaranteed to be present. The\nsimplest possibility, however, is a single first order phase transition between\nCFL and nuclear matter. Such a transition, in space, could take place either\nthrough a mixed phase region or at a single sharp interface with electron-free\nCFL and electron-rich nuclear matter in stable contact. Here we construct a\nmodel for such an interface. It is characterized by a region of separated\ncharge, similar to an inversion layer at a metal-insulator boundary. On the CFL\nside, the charged boundary layer is dominated by a condensate of negative\nkaons. We then consider the energetics of the mixed phase alternative.

Therefore the D-term inflation model in supergravity with\nconstant FI terms has to be revisited.\n  We also investigate the case of the so-called anomalous U(1) when a chiral\nsuperfield is shifted under U(1). In such a case, in the context of string\ntheory, the FI terms originate from the derivative of the Kaehler potential and\nthey are inevitably field-dependent. This raises an issue of stabilization of\nthe relevant field in applications to cosmology.\n  The recently suggested equivalence between the D-term strings and D-branes of\ntype II theory shows that brane-anti-brane systems produce FI terms in the\neffective 4d theory, with the Ramond-Ramond axion shifting under the U(1)\nsymmetry. This connection gives the possibility to interpret many unknown\nproperties of D-\\bar{D} systems in the more familiar language of 4d\nsupergravity D-terms, and vice versa.
