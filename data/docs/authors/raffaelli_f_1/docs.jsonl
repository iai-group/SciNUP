The dilaton to matter coupling \"constant\" $f$ appears to be dependent of\nthe matter density.

It is shown here that\nlikewise the transverse part of the electric current in the Coulomb gauge\nwithin Maxwell's theory the sources of the TT gauge part of the metric\nperturbations become non-local. This, in practice, invokes the necessity of the\nuse of more adequate projection operators then the ones applied, e.g, in the\nweak field limit, and in many post-Newtonian considerations.

Inequivalent quantizations lead to\ndifferent physics. Recently, however, some uniqueness results have been\nobtained for fields in non-stationary settings. In particular, for vacua that\nare invariant under the background symmetries, a unitary implementation of the\nclassical evolution suffices to pick up a unique Fock quantization in the case\nof Klein-Gordon fields with time-dependent mass, propagating in a static\nspacetime whose spatial sections are three-spheres.

These two sets of constraints\nare equivalent and represent the dual nature of the harmonic gauge. We explore\nthis duality and show that the harmonic gauge allows presenting an accelerated\nmetric in an elegant form that depends only on two harmonic potentials.

One key technology for such\narrays is readout multiplexing: the ability to read out many sensors\nsimultaneously on the same set of wires. This paper describes a\nfrequency-domain multiplexed readout system which has been developed for and\ndeployed on the APEX-SZ and South Pole Telescope millimeter wavelength\nreceivers. In this system, the detector array is divided into modules of seven\ndetectors, and each bolometer within the module is biased with a unique ~MHz\nsinusoidal carrier such that the individual bolometer signals are well\nseparated in frequency space. The currents from all bolometers in a module are\nsummed together and pre-amplified with Superconducting Quantum Interference\nDevices (SQUIDs) operating at 4 K.

An automated active control system\nfor the stabilization of the SiPMs gain was developed, based on the voltage\nsupply compensation of the gain drifts. The gain is shown to be stabilized\nwithin 0.2% relative variation around its nominal value, provided by Hamamatsu,\nin a temperature range of 10 degree C. The noise level from the electronics and\nthe SiPM dark noise is shown to lay typically below the level of 10\nphotoelectrons (pe) in the ADC. Hence, a detection threshold at 10 pe is set\nfor the acquisition of the tracking signals. The ADC full dynamic range (4096\nchannels) is shown to be adequate for signal levels of up to 200\npe/microsecond, which enables recording most of the tracking signals. \n\n"}

Conventionally, this problem is overcome by the use of\nion-gating structures. This method, however, introduces large dead times and\nrestricts trigger rates to a few hundred per second. The ion gate can be\neliminated from the setup by the use of Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) foils for\ngas amplification, which intrinsically suppress the backflow of ions. This\nmakes the continuous operation of a TPC at high rates feasible.\n  In this work, Monte Carlo simulations of the buildup of ion space charge in a\nGEM-based TPC and the correction of the resulting drift distortions are\ndiscussed, based on realistic numbers for the ion backflow in a triple-GEM\namplification stack.

The\ntrigger and timing system of the Double Chooz experiment was designed according\nto this goal. The Double Chooz trigger system is driven by the basic idea of\ntriggering on multiple thresholds according to the total visible energy and\nadditionally triggering on the number of active photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) in\nthe detector. To do so, the trigger system continuously monitors the analogue\nsignals from all PMTs in the detector. The amplitudes of these PMT-signals are\nsummed for groups of certain PMTs (group signals) and for all PMTs (sum\nsignal), respectively. The group signals are discriminated by two thresholds\nfor each input channel and four thresholds for the sum signal. The resulting\nsignals are processed by the trigger logic unit which is implemented in a FPGA.\nIn addition to the proper trigger, the trigger system provides a common clock\nsignal for all subsequent data acquisition systems to guarantee a synchronous\nreadout of the Double Chooz detectors.

The effect of gauge fields on the running of gravitational\ncouplings is investigated. The coupled system of gauge field with\nhigher-derivative gravity is shown to satisfy unitarity when quantum\ncorrections are taken in to account.

Abstract: Of course not, but if one believes that information cannot be destroyed in a\ntheory of quantum gravity, then we run into apparent contradictions with\nquantum theory when we consider evaporating black holes. Namely that the\nno-cloning theorem or the principle of entanglement monogamy is violated. Here,\nwe show that neither violation need hold, since, in arguing that black holes\nlead to cloning or non-monogamy, one needs to assume a tensor product structure\nbetween two points in space-time that could instead be viewed as causally\nconnected. In the latter case, one is violating the semi-classical causal\nstructure of space, which is a strictly weaker implication than cloning or\nnon-monogamy. We show that the lack of monogamy that can emerge in evaporating\nspace times is one that is allowed in quantum mechanics, and is very naturally\nrelated to a lack of monogamy of correlations of outputs of measurements\nperformed at subsequent instances of time of a single system. A particular\nexample of this is the Horowitz-Maldacena proposal, and we argue that it\nneedn't lead to cloning or violations of entanglement monogamy. For\nmeasurements on systems which appear to be leaving a black hole, we introduce\nthe notion of the temporal product, and argue that it is just as natural a\nchoice for measurements as the tensor product. For black holes, the tensor and\ntemporal products have the same measurement statistics, but result in different\ntype of non-monogamy of correlations, with the former being forbidden in\nquantum theory while the latter is allowed.

The signal obtained from these\ndetectors depends first on the physics of the medium (the initial scintillation\nand ionization), and second how the physics of the detector manipulates the\nresulting photons and liberated electrons. In this paper we develop a model of\nthe detector physics that incorporates event topology, detector geometry,\nelectric field configuration, purity, optical properties of components, and\nwavelength shifters.

The gas inside\nthe TPCs can be used as an active target to study the neutrino interactions in\ngreat detail. The low density of the gas leads to very low track energy\nthresholds, allowing the reconstruction of very low momentum tracks, e.g.\nprotons with kinetic energies down to $\\mathcal{O}$(1 MeV). Since different\nnuclear interaction models vary considerably in their predictions of those low\nmomentum track multiplicities, this makes neutrino interactions on gases a\npowerful probe to test those models. The TPCs operate with an argon-based gas\nmixture (95% by volume) and have been exposed to the T2K neutrino beam since\nthe beginning of the experiment in 2010.

The high density of hits on a given particle track facilitates the task\nof pattern recognition in a high-occupancy environment and in addition provides\nparticle identification by measuring the specific energy loss for each track.\nFor these reasons, TPCs with Multiwire Proportional Chamber (MWPC)\namplification have been and are widely used in experiments recording heavy-ion\ncollisions. A significant drawback, however, is the large dead time of the\norder of 1 ms per event generated by the use of a gating grid, which is\nmandatory to prevent ions created in the amplification region from drifting\nback into the drift volume, where they would severely distort the drift path of\nsubsequent tracks. For experiments with higher event rates this concept of a\nconventional TPC operating with a triggered gating grid can therefore not be\napplied without a significant loss of data. A continuous readout of the signals\nis the more appropriate way of operation. This, however, constitutes a change\nof paradigm with considerable challenges to be met concerning the amplification\nregion, the design and bandwidth of the readout electronics, and the data\nhandling. A mandatory prerequisite for such an operation is a sufficiently good\nsuppression of the ion backflow from the avalanche region, which otherwise\nlimits the tracking and particle identification capabilities of such a\ndetector.

In fact, most collapsing\nmasses are bounced back due to centrifugal force, since angular momentum\nsignificantly grows before collapse. As a consequence, most of the formed PBHs\nare rapidly rotating near the extreme value $a_{*}=1$, where $a_{*}$ is the\nnondimensional Kerr parameter at their formation. The smaller the density\nfluctuation $\\sigma_{H}$ at horizon entry is, the stronger the tendency towards\nthe extreme rotation.

Combining\nthe $H(z)$ and the Type Ia supernova data we find that the $H(z)$/SNIa overall\nstatistical analysis provides a substantial improvement of the cosmological\nconstraints with respect to those of the $H(z)$ analysis. Moreover, the\n$w_{0}-w_{1}$ parameter space provided by the $H(z)$/SNIa joint analysis is in\na very good agreement with that of Planck 2015, which confirms that the present\nanalysis with the $H(z)$ and SNIa probes correctly reveals the expansion of the\nUniverse as found by the team of Planck. Finally, we generate sets of Monte\nCarlo realizations in order to quantify the ability of the $H(z)$ data to\nprovide strong constraints on the dark energy model parameters. The Monte Carlo\napproach shows significant improvement of the constraints, when increasing the\nsample to 100 $H(z)$ measurements. Such a goal can be achieved in the future,\nespecially in the light of the next generation of surveys. \n\n"}

Conceptual aspects and cosmological predictions Abstract: Even if the fundamental action of gravity is local, the corresponding quantum\neffective action, that includes the effect of quantum fluctuations, is a\nnonlocal object. These nonlocalities are well understood in the ultraviolet\nregime but much less in the infrared, where they could in principle give rise\nto important cosmological effects. Here we systematize and extend previous work\nof our group, in which it is assumed that a mass scale $\\Lambda$ is dynamically\ngenerated in the infrared, giving rise to nonlocal terms in the quantum\neffective action of gravity. We give a detailed discussion of conceptual\naspects related to nonlocal gravity and of the cosmological consequences of\nthese models. The requirement of providing a viable cosmological evolution\nseverely restricts the form of the nonlocal terms, and selects a model (the\nso-called RR model) that corresponds to a dynamical mass generation for the\nconformal mode. For such a model: (1) there is a FRW background evolution,\nwhere the nonlocal term acts as an effective dark energy with a phantom\nequation of state, providing accelerated expansion without a cosmological\nconstant. (2) Cosmological perturbations are well behaved. (3) Implementing the\nmodel in a Boltzmann code and comparing with observations we find that the RR\nmodel fits the CMB, BAO, SNe, structure formation data and local $H_0$\nmeasurements at a level statistically equivalent to $\\Lambda$CDM.

In many modern\nexperiments, large calorimeter systems play a central role, and this is\nexpected to be no different for experiments that are currently being\nplanned/designed for future accelerators. In this paper, the state of the art\nas well as new developments in calorimetry are reviewed. The latter are of\ncourse inspired by the perceived demands of future experiments, and/or the\nincreasing demands of the current generation of experiments, as these are\nconfronted with, for example, increased luminosity.

The goal is to describe the changes between the measurements of the\nlight performed by a sample of observers slightly displaced with respect to\neach other and moving with different 4-velocities and 4-accelerations. In our\napproach, all results of observations can be expressed as functions of the\nkinematic variables, describing the motions of the observers and the emitting\nbodies with respect to their local inertial frames, and four linear bilocal\ngeodesic operators, describing the influence of the spacetime geometry on light\npropagation. The operators are functionals of the curvature tensor along the\nline of sight. The results are based on the assumption that the regions of\nemissions and observations are sufficiently small so that the spacetime\ncurvature effects are negligible within each of them, although they are\nsignificant for the light propagation between them. The new formulation\nprovides a uniform approach to optical phenomena in curved spacetimes and, as\nan application, we discuss the problem of a fully relativistic definition of\nthe parallax and position drifts (or proper motions).

Our proposal yields a dynamics independent of the\nchoice of time slicing at intermediate times but after the potential is turned\noff, the dynamics does not return to the free particle dynamics. Next we apply\nour proposal to the closed Robertson-Walker quantum cosmology with a massless\nscalar field with the size of the universe as our time variable, so the only\ndynamical variable is the scalar field.

Small\nliquid scintillator detectors have already demonstrated sensitivity to\noperational power levels, but more sensitive monitoring requires improvements\nin the efficiency and uniformity of these detectors. In this work, we use a\nmontecarlo simulation to investigate the detector performance of four different\ndetector configurations. Based on the analysis of neutron detection efficiency\nand positron energy response, we find that the optimal detector design will\ndepend on the goals and restrictions of the specific installation or\napplication. We have attempted to present the relevant information so that\nfuture detector development can proceed in a profitable direction. \n\n"}

Several stacks of CR39 nuclear track detectors with different\ntarget combinations were exposed at normal incidence to high energy accelerator\nbeams to integrated densities of about 2000 ions/cm^2. The nuclear track\ndetector foils were chemically etched, and ion tracks were measured using an\nautomatic image analyzer system. The cross section determination is based on\nthe charge identification of beam ions and their fragments and on the\nreconstruction of their path through the stacks. \n\n"}

At\nsmallest incidence angles the capture probability reaches 99 percent. A pair of\ncrystals with cuts bent in orthogonal planes allows to reach a 99.9 percent\nefficiency of single-pass deflection of a proton beam with an ultra small\ndivergence. Conditions necessary for efficient single-pass deflection of\nprotons from the LHC beam halo are discussed. \n\n"}

We demonstrate that\nlow energy gamma rays down to few keV is detected with CsI(Tl) crystal\ndetector. A clear peak at 6 keV is observed using X-ray source. Good energy\nresolution and linearity have been achieved down to X-ray region. In addition,\nwe also show that alpha particles and gamma rays can be clearly separated using\nthe different time characteristics of the crystal. \n\n"}
