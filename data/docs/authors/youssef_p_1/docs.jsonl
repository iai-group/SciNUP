In practice these\nmethods are extended beyond this simplified setting with the use of heuristics\nthat produce global alignments of the input sequences--an important problem\nwhich has no rigorous model-based solution. In this paper we consider a new\nversion of the multiple sequence alignment in the context of stochastic indel\nmodels.

As shown there, for the\nlight-tailed meta distribution the sample clouds, properly scaled, converge\nonto a deterministic set. The shape of the limit set gives a good description\nof the relation between extreme observations in different directions. This\npaper investigates how sensitive the limit shape is to changes in the\nunderlying heavy-tailed distribution. Copulas fit in well with multivariate\nextremes. By Galambos's theorem, existence of directional derivatives in the\nupper endpoint of the copula is necessary and sufficient for convergence of the\nmultivariate extremes provided the marginal maxima converge. The copula of the\nmax-stable limit distribution does not depend on the margins. So margins seem\nto play a subsidiary role in multivariate extremes. The theory and examples\npresented in this paper cast a different light on the significance of margins.\nFor light-tailed meta distributions, the asymptotic behaviour is very sensitive\nto perturbations of the underlying heavy-tailed original distribution, it may\nchange drastically even when the asymptotic behaviour of the heavy-tailed\ndensity is not affected. \n\n"}

In the eighties, three physicists, Knizhnik, Polyakov et\nZamolodchikov (KPZ) came up in \\cite{\\KPZ} with a novel and far-reaching\napproach in order to understand the critical behavior of these models. Among\nthese, one finds for example random walks, percolation as well as the Ising\nmodel. The main underlying idea of their approach is to study these models\nalong a two-step procedure as follows: a/ First of all, instead of considering\nthe model on some regular lattice of the plane (such as $\\Z^2$ for example),\none defines it instead on a well-chosen \"random planar lattice\". Doing so\ncorresponds to studying the model in its {\\it quantum gravity} form. In the\ncase of percolation, the appropriate choice of random lattice matches with the\nso-called planar maps. b/ Then it remains to get back to the actual {\\it\nEuclidean} setup.

When passing to\n$\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$ one wants to add more: the convergence of the star\nproduct should be controlled for a large completion of the symmetric algebra.\nAssuming that the underlying vector space carries a locally convex topology and\nthe bilinear form is continuous, we establish a locally convex topology on the\nWeyl algebra such that the star product becomes continuous.

Is $G$ close in cut-distance to a typical $G(n,r)$? Via a beautiful\nnew framework for large deviation principles in $G(n,p)$, Chatterjee and\nVaradhan gave bounds on the replica symmetric phase, the region of $(p,r)$\nwhere the answer is positive. They further showed that for any small enough $p$\nthere are at least two phase transitions as $r$ varies.\n  We settle this question by identifying the replica symmetric phase for\ntriangles and more generally for any fixed $d$-regular graph. By analyzing the\nvariational problem arising from the framework of Chatterjee and Varadhan we\nshow that the replica symmetry phase consists of all $(p,r)$ such that\n$(r^d,h_p(r))$ lies on the convex minorant of $x\\mapsto h_p(x^{1/d})$ where\n$h_p$ is the rate function of a binomial with parameter $p$.

By contrast, it has been\nargued in the science literature that such networks are highly vulnerable to a\ntargeted attack, and removing a small number of key nodes in the network will\ndramatically change the topological structure. Here we analyse a class of\npreferential attachment networks in the robust regime and prove four main\nresults supporting this claim: After removal of an arbitrarily small proportion\nepsilon>0 of the oldest nodes (1) the asymptotic degree distribution has\nexponential instead of power law tails; (2) the largest degree in the network\ndrops from being of the order of a power of the network size n to being just\nlogarithmic in n; (3) the typical distances in the network increase from order\nlog log n to order log n; and (4) the network becomes vulnerable to random\nremoval of nodes. Importantly, all our results explicitly quantify the\ndependence on the proportion epsilon of removed vertices. For example, we show\nthat the critical proportion of nodes that have to be retained for survival of\nthe giant component undergoes a steep increase as epsilon moves away from zero,\nand a comparison of this result with similar ones for other networks reveals\nthe existence of two different universality classes of robust network models.\nThe key technique in our proofs is a local approximation of the network by a\nbranching random walk with two killing boundaries, and an understanding of the\nparticle genealogies in this process, which enters into estimates for the\nspectral radius of an associated operator. \n\n"}

These processes describe the evolution of\na system of Brownian particles moving on the real line with piecewise constant\ndrifts, and are the natural generalization of the rank-based diffusion\nprocesses introduced in stochastic portfolio theory or in the probabilistic\ninterpretation of nonlinear evolution equations. Owing to the discontinuity of\nthe drift coefficient, the corresponding ordinary differential equations are\nill-posed. Therefore, the small noise limit of order-based diffusion processes\nis not covered by the classical Freidlin-Wentzell theory. The description of\nthis limit is the purpose of this article. We first give a complete analysis of\nthe two-particle case. Despite its apparent simplicity, the small noise limit\nof such a system already exhibits various behaviours. In particular, depending\non the drift coefficient, the particles can either stick into a cluster, the\nvelocity of which is determined by elementary computations, or drift away from\neach other at constant velocity, in a random ordering. The persistence of\nrandomness in the zero noise limit is of the very same nature as in the\npioneering works by Veretennikov (Mat.

In this work we derive new analytic results\nconcerning the computational complexity of multilevel Monte Carlo tau-leaping\nthat are significantly sharper than previous ones. We avoid taking asymptotic\nlimits, and focus on a practical setting where the system size is large enough\nfor many events to take place along a path, so that exact simulation of paths\nis expensive, making tau-leaping an attractive option. We use a general scaling\nof the system components that allows for the reaction rate constants and the\nabundances of species to vary over several orders of magnitude, and we exploit\nthe random time change representation developed by Kurtz.

Gamarnik\nand Sudan (2014) showed that local algorithms are weaker than global algorithms\nfor finding large independent sets in sparse random regular graphs. Montanari\n(2015) showed that local algorithms are suboptimal for finding a community with\nhigh connectivity in the sparse Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi random graphs. For the\nsymmetric planted partition problem (also named community detection for the\nblock models) on sparse graphs, a simple observation is that local algorithms\ncannot have non-trivial performance.\n  In this work we consider the effect of side information on local algorithms\nfor community detection under the binary symmetric stochastic block model. In\nthe block model with side information each of the $n$ vertices is labeled $+$\nor $-$ independently and uniformly at random; each pair of vertices is\nconnected independently with probability $a/n$ if both of them have the same\nlabel or $b/n$ otherwise. The goal is to estimate the underlying vertex\nlabeling given 1) the graph structure and 2) side information in the form of a\nvertex labeling positively correlated with the true one.

Like\nrectified linear units (ReLUs), leaky ReLUs (LReLUs) and parametrized ReLUs\n(PReLUs), ELUs alleviate the vanishing gradient problem via the identity for\npositive values. However, ELUs have improved learning characteristics compared\nto the units with other activation functions. In contrast to ReLUs, ELUs have\nnegative values which allows them to push mean unit activations closer to zero\nlike batch normalization but with lower computational complexity. Mean shifts\ntoward zero speed up learning by bringing the normal gradient closer to the\nunit natural gradient because of a reduced bias shift effect. While LReLUs and\nPReLUs have negative values, too, they do not ensure a noise-robust\ndeactivation state. ELUs saturate to a negative value with smaller inputs and\nthereby decrease the forward propagated variation and information. Therefore,\nELUs code the degree of presence of particular phenomena in the input, while\nthey do not quantitatively model the degree of their absence. In experiments,\nELUs lead not only to faster learning, but also to significantly better\ngeneralization performance than ReLUs and LReLUs on networks with more than 5\nlayers.

To distinguish such models from genuine quantum physical\nmodels, they often called quantum-like (although often people simply speak\nabout, e.g., \"quantum cognition\"). These novel applications generate a number\nof foundational questions. Nowadays we can speak about a new science -\nfoundations of quantum-like modeling. At the first stage this science was\nmainly about comparison of classical and quantum models, mainly in the\nprobabilistic setting. It was found that statistical data from cognitive\npsychology violate some basic constraints posed on data by classical\nprobability theory (Kolmogorov, 1933); in particular, the constraints given by\nthe formula of total probability and Bell's type inequalities. Recently another\nquestion attracted some attention. In spite of real success in applications,\nthere are no reason to believe that the quantum probability would cover\ncompletely all problems of, e.g., cognition. May be more general probability\nmodels have to be explored. A similar problem attracted a lot of attention in\nfoundations of quantum physics culminating in a series of experiments to check\nSorkin's equality for the triple-slit experiment by Weihs' group. In this note\nwe present a similar test in the cognitive experimental setting. Performance of\nthis test would either give further confirmation of the adequacy of the quantum\nprobability model to cognitive applications or rejection of the conventional\nquantum model. Thus this note opens the door for a series of exciting\nexperimental tests for the quantum-like model of cognition. \n\n"}

Abstract: Domains of attraction are identified for the universality classes of\none-point asymptotic fluctuations for the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation\nwith general initial data. The criterion is based on a large deviation rate\nfunction for the rescaled initial data, which arises naturally from the\nHopf-Cole transformation. This allows us, in particular, to distinguish the\ndomains of attraction of curved, flat, and Brownian initial data, and to\nidentify the boundary between the curved and flat domains of attraction, which\nturns out to correspond to square root initial data.\n  The distribution of the asymptotic one-point fluctuations is characterized by\nmeans of a variational formula written in terms of certain limiting processes\n(arising as subsequential limits of the spatial fluctuations of KPZ equation\nwith narrow wedge initial data, as shown in [CH16]) which are widely believed\nto coincide with the Airy$_2$ process.

Here we extend\ncoarse-graining to open Markov processes. An \"open\" Markov process is one where\nprobability can flow in or out of certain states called \"inputs\" and \"outputs\".\nOne can build up an ordinary Markov process from smaller open pieces in two\nbasic ways: composition, where we identify the outputs of one open Markov\nprocess with the inputs of another, and tensoring, where we set two open Markov\nprocesses side by side. In previous work, Fong, Pollard and the first author\nshowed that these constructions make open Markov processes into the morphisms\nof a symmetric monoidal category. Here we go further by constructing a\nsymmetric monoidal double category where the 2-morphisms are ways of\ncoarse-graining open Markov processes. We also extend the already known\n\"black-boxing\" functor from the category of open Markov processes to our double\ncategory. Black-boxing sends any open Markov process to the linear relation\nbetween input and output data that holds in steady states, including\nnonequilibrium steady states where there is a nonzero flow of probability\nthrough the process. To extend black-boxing to a functor between double\ncategories, we need to prove that black-boxing is compatible with\ncoarse-graining. \n\n"}

Each node of the\ntorus is connected to all the nodes located in an $l_\\infty$-ball of radius $w$\nin the toroidal space centered at itself and we assume that $h$ is\nexponentially larger than $w^2$. Based on the states of the neighboring\nparticles and on the value of a common intolerance threshold $\\tau$, every\nparticle is labeled \"stable,\" or \"unstable.\" Every unstable particle that can\nbecome stable by flipping its state is labeled \"p-stable.\" Finally, unstable\nparticles that remained p-stable for a random, independent and identically\ndistributed waiting time, flip their state and become stable. When the waiting\ntimes have an exponential distribution and $\\tau \\le 1/2$, this model is\nequivalent to a Schelling model of self-organized segregation in an open\nsystem, a zero-temperature Ising model with Glauber dynamics, or an\nAsynchronous Cellular Automaton (ACA) with extended Moore neighborhoods.

This models are known to be substantially\nmore flexible than Gaussian based models. One current problem of this approach\nis the unavailability of a tractable exact analysis of likelihood based\nstochastic volatility models for the returns of log prices of stocks.\n  With this point in mind, the likelihood models of Barndorff-Nielsen and\nShephard are viewed as members of a much larger class of models. That is\nlikelihoods based on n conditionally independent Normal random variables whose\nmean and variance are representable as linear functionals of a common\nunobserved Poisson random measure.

In particular, the Jones'\ntower always exists in the W*-case and for Ind(E) in E(A) in the C*-case.\nFurthermore, normal conditional expectations of finite index commute with the\ngeneral W*-projections to their finite, infinite, discrete and continuous type\nI, type II_1, type II_\\infty and type III parts, i.e. the respective\nprojections in the centers of the initial and the image W*-algebra coincide. We\ngive an interpretation of our result in terms of non-commutative topology and\nindicate some dimension estimation formulae and an inequality. \n\n"}

The model we take as\nexample is Hammersley's process as seen from a tagged particle, which can be\nviewed as a process of interacting positive-valued stick heights on the sites\nof Z. It is known that under Euler scaling (space and time scale n) the\nempirical stick profile obeys the Burgers equation. We refine this result in\ntwo ways: If the process starts close enough to equilibrium, then over times\nn^\\nu for 1\\le\\nu<3, and up to errors that vanish in hydrodynamic scale, the\ndynamics merely translates the initial stick configuration. A time evolution\nfor the perturbation is visible under a particular family of scalings: over\ntimes n^\\nu, 1<\\nu<3/2, a perturbation of order n^(1-\\nu) from equilibrium\nfollows the inviscid Burgers equation. The results for the stick model are\nderived from asymptotic results for tagged particles in Hammersley's process. \n\n"}
{"id": "math/9911162", "contents": "Title: Perfect simulation for interacting point processes, loss networks and\n  Ising models Abstract: We present a perfect simulation algorithm for measures that are absolutely\ncontinuous with respect to some Poisson process and can be obtained as\ninvariant measures of birth-and-death processes. Examples include area- and\nperimeter-interacting point processes (with stochastic grains), invariant\nmeasures of loss networks, and the Ising contour and random cluster models. The\nalgorithm does not involve couplings of the process with different initial\nconditions and it is not tied up to monotonicity requirements. Furthermore, it\ndirectly provides perfect samples of finite windows of the infinite-volume\nmeasure, subjected to time and space ``user-impatience bias''. The algorithm is\nbased on a two-step procedure: (i) a perfect-simulation scheme for a (finite\nand random) relevant portion of a (space-time) marked Poisson processes (free\nbirth-and-death process, free loss networks), and (ii) a ``cleaning'' algorithm\nthat trims out this process according to the interaction rules of the target\nprocess. The first step involves the perfect generation of ``ancestors'' of a\ngiven object, that is of predecessors that may have an influence on the\nbirth-rate under the target process. The second step, and hence the whole\nprocedure, is feasible if these ``ancestors'' form a finite set with\nprobability one. We present a sufficiency criteria for this condition, based on\nthe absence of infinite clusters for an associated (backwards) oriented\npercolation model. \n\n"}
