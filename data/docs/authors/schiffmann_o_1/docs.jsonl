When the target space is a flag manifold of\nsimple G, and the gauge group is a Cartan subgroup thereof, the perturbative\nmodel describes, purely physically, the recently formulated mathematical theory\nof \"Twisted Chiral Differential Operators\". This paves the way, via a\ngeneralized T-duality, for a natural physical interpretation of the geometric\nLanglands correspondence for simply-connected, simple, complex Lie groups. In\nparticular, the Hecke eigensheaves and Hecke operators can be described in\nterms of the correlation functions of certain operators that underlie the\ninfinite-dimensional chiral algebra of the flag manifold model. Nevertheless,\nnonperturbative worldsheet twisted-instantons can, in some situations,\ntrivialize the chiral algebra completely.

{"id": "1304.1753", "contents": "Title: Stable representation homology and Koszul duality Abstract: This paper is a sequel to [BKR], where we studied the derived affine scheme\nDRep_n(A) of the classical representation scheme Rep_n(A) for an associative\nk-algebra A. In [BKR], we have constructed canonical trace maps Tr_n(A): HC(A)\n-> H[DRep_n(A)]^GL extending the usual characters of representations to higher\ncyclic homology. This raises a question whether a well known theorem of Procesi\n[P] holds in the derived setting: namely, is the algebra homomorphism\nSym[Tr_n(A)]: Sym[HC(A)] -> H[DRep_n(A)]^GL defined by Tr_n(A) surjective ? In\nthe present paper, we answer this question for augmented algebras. Given such\nan algebra, we construct a canonical dense DG subalgebra DRep_\\infty(A)^Tr of\nthe topological DG algebra DRep_\\infty(A)^{GL_\\infty}. It turns out that on\npassing to the inverse limit (as n -> \\infty), the family of maps Sym[Tr_n(A)]\n\"stabilizes\" to an isomorphism Sym[\\bar{HC}(A)] = H[DRep_\\infty(A)^Tr]. The\nderived version of Procesi's theorem does therefore hold in the limit. However,\nfor a fixed (finite) n, there exist homological obstructions to the\nsurjectivity of Sym[Tr_n(A)], and we show on simple examples that these\nobstructions do not vanish in general.

For\nclassical Lie algebras, Kraft and Procesi showed that these two types of\nsingularities suffice to describe all generic singularities of nilpotent orbit\nclosures: specifically, any such singularity is either a simple surface\nsingularity, a minimal singularity, or a union of two simple surface\nsingularities of type $A_{2k-1}$.

It is shown that for the precise definition of\nthe algebra one needs the commutation relations for the deformed algebra of\nformal currents and the specialization of the Riemann problem for the currents.\nTwo different Riemann problems are considered. They lead to the central\nextended Yangian double associated with ${sl}_2$ and to the degeneration of\nscaling limit of elliptic affine algebra. Unless the defining relations for the\ngenerating functions of the both algebras coincide their properties and the\ntheory of infinite-dimensional representations are quite different. We discuss\nalso the Riemann problem for twisted algebras and for scaled elliptic algebra. \n\n"}
{"id": "quant-ph/9806007", "contents": "Title: Prime decomposition and correlation measure of finite quantum systems Abstract: Under the name prime decomposition (pd), a unique decomposition of an\narbitrary $N$-dimensional density matrix $\\rho$ into a sum of seperable density\nmatrices with dimensions given by the coprime factors of $N$ is introduced. For\na class of density matrices a complete tensor product factorization is\nachieved. The construction is based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem and the\nprojective unitary representation of $Z_N$ by the discrete Heisenberg group\n$H_N$. The pd isomorphism is unitarily implemented and it is shown to be\ncoassociative and to act on $H_N$ as comultiplication. Density matrices with\ncomplete pd are interpreted as grouplike elements of $H_N$. To quantify the\ndistance of $\\rho$ from its pd a trace-norm correlation index $\\cal E$ is\nintroduced and its invariance groups are determined. \n\n"}
