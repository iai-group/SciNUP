The\nintracluster helium abundance cannot be measured directly. This presents a\nsignificant source of uncertainty for cosmological tests based on the X-ray\nderived cluster quantities, such as the gas mass, total mass, and gas mass\nfraction, all of which depend on the assumed helium abundance.

Our main focus is on a simple model system where the\ntotal density profile is that of an $n=1$ polytrope. We derive a partially\nanalytic solution for the superfluid analogue of the classical r-mode. This\nsolution is used to analyse the relevance of the vortex mediated mutual\nfriction damping, confirming that this dissipation mechanism is unlikely to\nsuppress the gravitational-wave driven instability in rapidly spinning\nsuperfluid neutron stars.

These latter effects introduce colored noise in the\nphotometric time series that can lead to a complete miss of the signal. By\nusing a large number of available photometric time series of a given field, TFA\nutilizes the fact that the same types of systematics appear in several/many\ntime series of the same field.

We present a post-detection detrending algorithm, which filters\nout signal on other timescales than the period of the transit while preserving\nthe transit signal.\n  We compare the performance of this new filter to a well-established\npre-detection detrending algorithm, by applying both to a set of 20 simulated\nlight curves containing planetary transits, stellar variability, and\ninstrumental noise as expected for the CoRoT space mission, and performing\nanalytic fits to the transits.

However, a one sigma increase in mass (5.6 M_E) and\ndecrease in size (1.59 R_E) are compatible with an Earth-like composition (33%\niron, 67% silicates). Alternatively, it is possible that CoRoT-7b contains a\nsignificant amount of volatiles. An equally good fit to the data is found for a\nvapor envelope equal to 3% (and up to 10%) by mass above an Earth-like nucleus.\nBecause of its intense irradiation and small size, the planet cannot possess an\nenvelope of H and He of more than 1/10,000 of its total mass.

The eccentricity of the outer\nplanet (ec) is estimated to be 0.11(+0.17,-0.04), comparable to that of Saturn\n(0.01-0.09). The similarities between the OGLE-06-109L system and the solar\nsystem indicate that they may have passed through similar histories during\ntheir formation stage. In this paper we investigate the dynamics and formation\nof the orbital architecture in the OGLE-06-109L system. For the present two\nplanets with their nominal locations, the secular motions are stable as long as\ntheir eccentricities (eb; ec) fulfill eb^2 + ec^2 < = 0.3^2. Earth-size bodies\nmight be formed and are stable in the habitable zone (0.25AU-0.36AU) of the\nsystem. Three possible scenarios may be accounted for formation of eb and ec:\n(i) convergent migration of two planets and the 3:1 MMR trapping; (ii)\nplanetary scattering; (iii) divergent migration and the 3:1 MMR crossing. As we\nshowed that the probability for the two giant planets in 3:1 MMR is low (~3%),\nscenario (i) is less likely. According to models (ii) and (iii), the final\neccentricity of inner planet (eb) may oscillate between [0-0.06], comparable to\nthat of Jupiter (0.03-0.06). An inspection of eb, ec secular motion may be\nhelpful to understand which model is really responsible for the eccentricity\nformation. \n\n"}

To do so, we assume that they\nretain a nonzero eccentricity, possibly by dint of continuing interaction with\na third body. We calculate the amount of extra heating in the envelope that is\nthen required to fit the radius of each planet, and we explore how this\nadditional power depends on the planetary atmospheric opacity and on the mass\nof a heavy-element central core. There is a degeneracy between the core mass\n$M_{\\rm core}$ and the heating $\\dot{E}_{\\rm heating}$. Therefore, in the case\nof tidal heating, there is for each planet a range of the couple $\\{M_{\\rm\ncore},e^2/Q'_p\\}$ that can lead to the same radius, where $Q'_p$ is the tidal\ndissipation factor and $e$ is the eccentricity. With this in mind, we also\ninvestigate the case of the non-inflated planet HAT-P-12b, which can admit\nsolutions combining a heavy-element core and tidal heating. A substantial\nimprovement of the measured eccentricities of such planetary systems could\nsimplify this degeneracy by linking the two unknown parameters $\\{M_{\\rm\ncore},Q'_p\\}$.

The MHD calculations use the stratified shearing-box approach and\ninclude grain settling and the feedback from the changing dust abundance on the\nresistivity of the gas. The two-decade spread in accretion rates among T Tauri\nstars is too large to result solely from variety in the grain size and stellar\nX-ray luminosity, but can be produced by varying these together with the disk\nmagnetic flux. The diversity in the silicate bands can come from the coupling\nof grain settling to the distribution of the magneto-rotational turbulence,\nthrough three effects: (1) Recombination on grains yields a magnetically\ninactive dead zone extending above two scale heights, while turbulence in the\nmagnetically active disk atmosphere overshoots the dead zone boundary by only\nabout one scale height. (2) Grains deep in the dead zone oscillate vertically\nin waves driven by the turbulent layer above, but on average settle at the\nlaminar rates, so the interior of the dead zone is a particle sink and the disk\natmosphere becomes dust-depleted. (3) With sufficient depletion, the dead zone\nis thinner and mixing dredges grains off the midplane. The MHD results also\nshow that the magnetic activity intermittently lifts clouds of dust into the\natmosphere. The photosphere height changes by up to one-third over a few\norbits, while the extinction along lines of sight grazing the disk surface\nvaries by factors of two over times down to 0.1 orbit.

We estimate the mass accretion rate and\ngrowth timescale of gas giant planets. The mass accretion rate increases with\nprotoplanet mass for M_p < M_cri, while it becomes saturated or decreases for\nM_p > M_cri, where M_cri = 0.036 M_Jup (a_p/1AU)^0.75, and M_Jup and a_p are\nthe Jovian mass and the orbital radius, respectively. The growth timescale of a\ngas giant planet or the timescale of the gas accretion onto the protoplanet is\nabout 10^5 yr, that is two orders of magnitude shorter than the growth\ntimescale of the solid core. The thermal effects barely affect the mass\naccretion rate because the gravitational energy dominates the thermal energy\naround the protoplanet. The mass accretion rate obtained in our local\nsimulations agrees quantitatively well with those obtained in global\nsimulations with coarser spatial resolution.

A model for the dust produced during self-stirring is\napplied to statistics for A stars. As there is no significant difference\nbetween excesses of A-stars <50Myr old, we focus on reproducing the broad\ntrends, the \"rise and fall\" of the fraction of stars with excesses. Using a\npopulation model, we find that the statistics and trends can be reproduced with\na self-stirring model of planetesimal belts with radii distributed between\n15-120AU. Disks must have this 15AU minimum radius to show a peak in disk\nfraction, rather than a monotonic decline. Populations of extended disks with\nfixed inner and/or outer radii fail to fit the statistics, due mainly to the\nslow 70um evolution as stirring moves further out in the disk. This conclusion,\nthat debris disks are narrow belts, is independent of the significance of 24um\ntrends for young A-stars. We show that the statistics can also be reproduced\nwith a model in which disks are stirred by secular perturbations from a nearby\neccentric planet. Detailed imaging is therefore the best way to characterise\nthe stirring mechanism. From a more detailed look at beta Pictoris Moving Group\nand TW Hydrae Association A-stars we find that the disk around beta Pictoris is\nlikely the result of secular stirring by the proposed planet at ~10AU; the\nstructure of the HR 4796A disk also points to sculpting by a planet. The two\nother stars with disks, HR 7012 and eta Tel, possess transient hot dust, though\nthe outer eta Tel disk is consistent with a self-stirred origin. Planet\nformation provides a natural explanation for the belt-like nature of debris\ndisks, with inner regions cleared by planets that may also stir the disk, and\nthe outer edges set by where planetesimals can form.

The linear analysis of the\ndissipative gravitational instability shows that the dust layer is secularly\nunstable although Toomre's $Q$ value is larger than unity. However, in the\ninitial stage, the growth time of the gravitational instability is longer than\nthat of the dust sedimentation and the decrease in the velocity dispersion.\nThus, the velocity dispersion decreases and the disk shrinks vertically. As the\nvelocity dispersion becomes sufficiently small, the gravitational instability\nfinally becomes dominant. Then wake-like density structures are formed by the\ngravitational instability. These structures fragment into planetesimal seeds.\nThe seeds grow rapidly owing to mutual collisions. \n\n"}

If the dynamo is in a diffusion-dominated regime,\nthen we find that most of the cycle amplitudes also get modeled up to some\nextent when we model the periods. Next, we propose that at the beginning of the\nMaunder minimum the amplitude of meridional circulation dropped to a low value\nand then after a few years it increased again. Several independent studies also\nfavor this assumption. With this assumption, a diffusion-dominated dynamo is\nable to reproduce many important features of the Maunder minimum remarkably\nwell. If the dynamo is in a diffusion-dominated regime, then a slower\nmeridional circulation means that the poloidal field gets more time to diffuse\nduring its transport through the convection zone, making the dynamo weaker.\nThis consequence helps to model both the cycle amplitudes and the Maunder-like\nminima. We, however, fail to reproduce these results if the dynamo is in an\nadvection-dominated regime. \n\n"}

Recently, it has been\npointed out that negative charging of dust in the weakly ionized disks could\nsignificantly slow down the coagulation process. In this paper, we apply the\ngrowth criteria obtained in Paper I to finding out a location (\"frozen\" zone)\nwhere the charging stalls dust growth at the fractal growth stage. For\nlow-turbulence disks, we find that the frozen zone can cover the major part of\nthe disks at a few to 100 AU from the central star. The maximum mass of the\naggregates is approximately 10^{-7} g at 1 AU and as small as a few monomer\nmasses at 100 AU. Strong turbulence can significantly reduce the size of the\nfrozen zone, but such turbulence will cause the fragmentation of macroscopic\naggregates at later stages. We examine a possibility that complete freezeout of\ndust evolution in low-turbulence disks could be prevented by global transport\nof dust in the disks. Our simple estimation shows that global dust transport\ncan lead to the supply of macroscopic aggregates and the removal of frozen\naggregates on a timescale of 10^6 yr.

The wavelength dependence\nof polarization indicates the dominance of Rayleigh scattering with a peak in\nthe blue B and U bands of ~10^-4+/-10^-5 and at least a factor of two lower\nsignal in the V band. The Rayleigh-like wavelength dependence, detected also in\nthe transmitted light during transits, implies a rapid decrease of the\npolarization signal toward longer wavelengths.

We recently suggested that WASP-12b may host a bow shock\naround its magnetosphere, similarly to the one observed around the Earth. For\nWASP12b, the shock is detected in the near-UV transit light curve.\nObservational follow-up suggests that the near-UV light curve presents temporal\nvariations, which may indicate that the stand-off distance between the shock\nand the planet is varying. This implies that the size of the planet's\nmagnetosphere is adjusting itself in response to variations in the surrounding\nambient medium. We investigate possible causes of shock variations for the\nknown eccentric (e>0.3) transiting planets. We show that, because the distance\nfrom the star changes along the orbit of an eccentric planet, the shock\ncharacteristics are modulated by orbital phase. We predict time offsets between\nthe beginnings of the near-UV and optical light curves that are, in general,\nless than the transit duration. Variations in shock characteristics caused in\neccentric systems can only be probed if the shock is observed at different\norbital phases, which is, in general, not the case for transit observations.\nHowever, non-thermal radio emission produced by the interaction of the star and\nplanet should be modulated by orbital phase. We also quantify the response of\nthe shock to variations in the coronal material itself due to, e.g., a\nnon-axisymmetric stellar corona, planetary obliquity, intrinsic variations of\nthe stellar magnetic field.

In\nthe 'massive disk mode' to which the majority of models belong, the disk mass\nis greater than the protostellar mass for over 10^4 years and no fragmentation\noccurs in the circumstellar disk. The collapsing cloud shows fragmentation\nbefore the protostar formation in the 'early fragmentation mode'. The\ncircumstellar disk shows fragmentation after the protostar formation in the\n'late fragmentation mode', in which the secondary star substantially gains its\nmass from the circumstellar disk after fragmentation and it has a mass\ncomparable to that of the primary star. The protostellar mass rapidly increases\nand exceeds the circumstellar disk mass in the 'protostar dominant mode'. This\nmode appears only when the initial molecular cloud core has a considerably\nsmall rotational energy.

Our goal was to detect the\nRossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect, the anomalous radial velocity observed during\neclipses of rotating stars, which can be used to study the obliquities of\nplanet-hosting stars. For WASP-1 a weak signal of a prograde orbit was detected\nwith ~2sigma confidence, and for WASP-2 no signal was detected. The resulting\nupper bounds on the RM amplitude have different implications for these two\nsystems, because of the contrasting transit geometries and the stellar types.\nBecause WASP-1 is an F7V star, and such stars are typically rapid rotators, the\nmost probable reason for the suppression of the RM effect is that the star is\nviewed nearly pole-on.

We show that\nNeptune-size planets at T_eq=500K with masses as small as a few times that of\nEarth can plausibly be formed core nucleated accretion coupled with subsequent\ninward migration. We also derive a limiting low-density mass-radius relation\nfor rocky planets with outgassed hydrogen envelopes but no surface water. Rocky\nplanets with outgassed hydrogen envelopes typically have computed radii well\nbelow 3 R_Earth.

Multiplanet systems provide two key ingredients for explaining the\norigins of transitional disks. First, multiple planets can clear wide inner\nholes where single planets open only narrow gaps.

The presence of tiny grains in PPDs thus raises the\nquestion of whether the magnetorotational instability (MRI) is able to drive\nrapid accretion to be consistent with observations. Charged tiny grains have\nsimilar conduction properties as ions, whose presence leads to qualitatively\nnew behaviors in the conductivity tensor, characterized by n_bar/n_e>1, where\nn_e and n_bar denote the number densities of free electrons and all other\ncharged species respectively. In particular, Ohmic conductivity becomes\ndominated by charged grains rather than electrons when n_bar/n_e exceeds about\n10^3, and Hall and ambipolar diffusion (AD) coefficients are reduced by a\nfactor of (n_bar/n_e)^2 in the AD dominated regime relative to that in the\nOhmic regime. Applying the methodology of Bai (2011), we find that in PPDs,\nwhen PAHs are sufficiently abundant (>1e-9 per H_2), there exists a transition\nradius r_trans of about 10-20 AU, beyond which the MRI active layer extends to\nthe disk midplane. At r<r_trans, the optimistically predicted MRI-driven\naccretion rate M_dot is one to two orders of magnitude smaller than that in the\ngrain-free case, which is too small compared with the observed rates, but is in\ngeneral no smaller than the predicted M_dot with solar-abundance 0.1 micron\ngrains. At r>r_trans, we find that remarkably, the predicted M_dot exceeds the\ngrain-free case due to a net reduction of AD by charged tiny grains, and\nreaches a few times 1e-8M_Sun/yr. This is sufficient to account for the\nobserved M_dot in transitional disks.

From a transit-based estimate of the host\nstar's mean density, combined with an estimate of the stellar effective\ntemperature T_eff=5630+/-100 K from high-resolution spectra, we infer a stellar\nhost mass of 1.061+/-0.067 M_sun and a stellar radius of 1.019+/-0.033 R_jup.\nWe estimate the planet mass and radius to be Mp=2.450+/-0.114 M_jup and\nRp=1.312+/-0.018 R_jup and a planet density near 1.35 g.cm-3. The host star is\nactive, with dark spots that are frequently occulted by the planet. The\ncontinuous monitoring of the star reveals a stellar rotation period of 11.89\ndays, 8 times the the planet's orbital period; this period ratio produces\nstroboscopic effects on the occulted starspots. The temporal pattern of these\nspot-crossing events shows that the planet's orbit is prograde and the star's\nobliquity is smaller than 15 deg. We detected planetary occultations of\nKepler-17b with both the Kepler and Spitzer Space Telescopes.

At first glance, this overall\noccurrence rate seems inconsistent with the planet frequency measured during\nQ0-Q2 of the Kepler Mission, whose 1,235 detected planetary candidates imply\nthat ~ 15% of main sequence dwarfs harbor short-period planets with R_pl < 4\nR_Earth.

We\nfind that a population concurrently consisting of (1) dense silicate-iron\nplanets and (2) low-density gas-dominated worlds provides a natural fit to the\ncurrent data. In this scenario, the fraction of dense planets decreases with\nincreasing mass, from f_rocky = 90% at M = 1 M_Earth to f_rocky = 10% at M = 17\nM_Earth.

Here, for the first time, we apply\nthe technique of optimal estimation to determine the thermal structure and\ncomposition of an exoplanet by solving the inverse problem. The development of\na suite of radiative transfer and retrieval tools for exoplanet atmospheres is\ndescribed, building upon a retrieval algorithm which is extensively used in the\nstudy of our own solar system.

Simple large-scale\nradial mixing cannot account for this gradient in the dust chemical\ncomposition, and some local crystalline formation mechanism may be effective in\nthis disk. The relatively high abundance of crystalline silicates in the outer\ncold regions of brown dwarf disks provides an interesting analogy to comets. In\nthis context, we have discussed the applicability of the various mechanisms\nthat have been proposed for comets on the formation and the outward transport\nof high-temperature material. We also present Chandra X-ray observations for\ntwo Taurus brown dwarfs, 2M04414825 and CFHT-BD-Tau 9. We find 2M04414825,\nwhich has a ~12% crystalline mass fraction, to be more than an order of\nmagnitude brighter in X-ray than CFHT-BD-Tau 9, which has a ~35% crystalline\nmass fraction.

The primary is a late F-type star. The binary orbit is well\ncharacterised and we conclude that the disk is misaligned with the binary\nplane. Two different models can explain the observed structure. The first model\nis a ring of polar orbits that move in a plane perpendicular to the binary\npericenter direction. We favour this interpretation because it includes the\neffect of secular perturbations and the disk can survive for Gyr timescales.\nThe second model is a misaligned ring. Because there is an ambiguity in the\norientation of the ring, which could be reflected in the sky plane, this ring\neither has near-polar orbits similar to the first model, or has a 30 degree\nmisalignment. The misaligned ring, interpreted as the result of a recent\ncollision, is shown to be implausible from constraints on the collisional and\ndynamical evolution.

Theoretical studies encounter difficulties in\nexplaining their formation and origin. Here we propose a novel scenario for the\nproduction of planetary systems at such orbits, through the dynamical recapture\nof free floating planets (FFPs) in dispersing stellar clusters. This process is\na natural extension of the recently suggested scenario for the formation of\nwide stellar binaries. We use N-body simulations of dispersing clusters with\n10-1000 stars and comparable numbers of FFPs to study this process. We find\nthat planets are captured into wide orbits in the typical range ~100-10^6 AU,\nand have a wide range of eccentricities (thermal distribution). Typically, 3-6\nx (f_FFP/1) % of all stars capture a planetary companion with such properties\n(where f_FFP is the number of FFP per star). The planetary capture efficiency\nis comparable to that of capture-formed stellar-binaries, and shows a similar\ndependence on the cluster size and structure. It is almost independent of the\nspecific planetary mass; planets as well as sub-stellar companions of any mass\ncan be captured. The capture efficiency decreases with increasing cluster size,\nand for a given cluster size the it increases with the host/primary mass. More\nthan one planet can be captured around the same host and planets can be\ncaptured into binary systems. Planets can also be captured into pre-existing\nplanetary and into orbits around black holes and massive white dwarfs, if these\nformed early enough before the cluster dispersal. In particular, stellar black\nholes have a high capture efficiency (>50 % and 5-10 x (f_FFP/1) % for capture\nof stars and planetary companions, respectively) due to their large mass.\nFinally, although rare, two FFPs or brown dwarfs can become bound and form a\nFFP-binary system with no stellar host. \n\n"}

The numerical results are in good agreement with our\nanalytic expressions, indicating the existence of two accretion regimes, one\nset by the azimuthal and radial particle drift for the lower seed masses and\nthe other, for higher masses, by the velocity at the edge of the Hill sphere.\nIn the former, the optimally accreted particle size increases with core mass,\nwhile in the latter the optimal size is centimeters, independent of core mass.\nWe discuss the implications for rapid core growth of gas-giant and ice-giant\ncores.

We use a global\nclimate model to simulate the thermal phase variations of Earth-analogs and\ntest whether these data could distinguish between planets with different heat\nstorage and heat transport characteristics. In particular, we consider a\ntemperate climate with polar ice caps (like modern Earth), and a snowball state\nwhere the oceans are globally covered in ice. We first quantitatively study the\nperiodic radiative forcing from, and climatic response to, rotation, obliquity,\nand eccentricity. Orbital eccentricity and seasonal changes in albedo cause\nvariations in the global-mean absorbed flux. The responses of the two climates\nto these global seasons indicate that the temperate planet has 3 times the bulk\nheat capacity of the snowball planet due to the presence of liquid water\noceans. The temperate obliquity seasons are weaker than one would expect based\non thermal inertia alone; this is due to cross-equatorial oceanic and\natmospheric energy transport. Thermal inertia and cross-equatorial heat\ntransport have qualitatively different effects on obliquity seasons, insofar as\nheat transport tends to reduce seasonal amplitude without inducing a phase lag.\nFor an Earth-like planet, however, this effect is masked by the mixing of\nsignals from low thermal inertia regions (sea ice and land) with that from high\nthermal inertia regions (oceans), which also produces a damped response with\nsmall phase lag. We then simulate thermal lightcurves as they would appear to a\nhigh-contrast imaging mission (TPF-I/Darwin) and consider the inverse problem\nof estimating thermal inertia based solely on time-resolved photometry.\n[Abridged] \n\n"}

The\nplanet light-curve is reanalysed using long and short cadence Kepler\nobservations from the first 14 quarters. Orbital period of the planet was\nimproved. We prove that the peculiar light-curve of this objects is in\nagreement with the idea of a planet with a comet like tail. There is an\nevidence of a quasi periodic long term evolution of the tail. Light-curve has a\nprominent pre-transit brightening and a less prominent post-transit\nbrightening. Both are caused by the forward scattering and are a strong\nfunction of the particle size. This feature enabled us to estimate a typical\nparticle size (radius) in the dust tail of about 0.1-1 micron. However, there\nis an indication that the particle size changes along the tail. Larger\nparticles better reproduce the pre-transit brightening and transit core while\nsmaller particles are more compatible with the egress and post-transit\nbrightening. Dust density in the tail is a steep decreasing function of the\ndistance from the planet which indicates a significant tail destruction caused\nby the star.

In non-isothermal discs, recent work has\nshown that a decreasing radial profile of the disc entropy can lead to a strong\npositive corotation torque which can significantly slow down or reverse Type I\nmigration in laminar viscous disc models. It is not clear however how this\npicture changes in turbulent disc models. The aim of this study is to examine\nthe impact of turbulence on the torque experienced by a low-mass planet\nembedded in a non-isothermal protoplanetary disc. We particularly focus on the\nrole of turbulence on the corotation torque whose amplitude depends on the\nefficiency of diffusion processes in the planet's horseshoe region. We\nperformed 2D numerical simulations using a grid-based hydrodynamical code in\nwhich turbulence is modelled as stochastic forcing. In order to provide\nestimations for the viscous and thermal diffusion coefficients as a function of\nthe amplitude of turbulence, we first set up non-isothermal disc models for\ndifferent values of the amplitude of the turbulent forcing.

For\nturbulence amplitudes that do not strongly affect the disc temperature profile,\nwe find that the running time-averaged torque experienced by an embedded\nprotoplanet is in fairly good agreement with laminar disc models with\nappropriate values for the thermal and viscous diffusion coefficients. In discs\nwith turbulence driven by stochastic forcing, the corotation torque therefore\nbehaves similarly as in laminar viscous discs and can be responsible for\nsignificantly slowing down or reversing Type I migration. \n\n"}

In the Milky Way,\nclusters with more than 2000 stars only form in two types - starburst clusters\nand leaky clusters - each following a unique temporal development in the\nmass-radius plane. The aim is here to determine the encounter probability in\nthe range relevant to solar system formation for starburst or leaky cluster\nenvironments as a function of cluster age. N-body methods are used to\ninvestigate the cluster dynamics and the effect of gravitational interactions\nbetween cluster members on young solar-type stars surrounded by discs.

Although it is known that when gas is isothermal, the PDF is\napproximately lognormal in the core, high-resolution simulations show large\ndeviations from exact log-normality. The proposed function provides an\nextraordinarily accurate description of the density PDFs in simulations with\nMach numbers ~0.1-15 and dispersion in log(rho) from ~0.01-4 dex. Compared to a\nlognormal or lognormal-skew-kurtosis model, the fits are improved by orders of\nmagnitude in the wings of the distribution (with fewer free parameters). This\nis true in simulations using distinct numerical methods, including or excluding\nmagnetic fields. Deviations from lognormality are represented by a parameter T\nthat increases with the compressive Mach number. The proposed distribution can\nbe derived from intermittent cascade models of the longitudinal (compressive)\nvelocity differences, which should be directly related to density fluctuations,\nand we provide a simple interpretation of the density PDF as the product of a\ncontinuous-time relaxation process. As such the parameter T is consistent with\nthe same parameter needed to explain the (intermittent) velocity structure\nfunctions; its behavior is consistent with turbulence becoming more\nintermittent as it becomes more dominated by strong shocks. It provides a new\nand unique probe of the role of intermittency in the density (not just\nvelocity) structure of turbulence. We show that this naturally explains some\napparent contradictory results in the literature based on use of different\nmoments of the density PDF, as well as differences based on whether\nvolume-weighted or mass-weighted quantities are measured. We show how these are\nfundamentally related to the fact that mass conservation requires violations of\nlog-normal statistics. \n\n"}

Motivated by these dynamical systems, this paper generalizes in two\ndirections previous studies of orbital evolution in planetary systems with\nstellar mass loss: [1] Many previous treatments focus on constant mass loss\nrates and much of this work is carried out numerically. Here we study a class\nof single planet systems where the stellar mass loss rate is time dependent.\nThe mass loss rate can be increasing or decreasing, but the stellar mass always\ndecreases monotonically. For this class of models, we develop analytic\napproximations to specify the final orbital elements for planets that remain\nbound after the epoch of mass loss, and find the conditions required for the\nplanets to become unbound. We also show that for some mass loss functions,\nplanets become unbound only in the asymptotic limit where the stellar mass\nvanishes. [2] We consider the chaotic evolution for two planet systems with\nstellar mass loss. Here we focus on a model consisting of analogs of Jupiter,\nSaturn, and the Sun. By monitoring the divergence of initially similar\ntrajectories through time, we calculate the Lyapunov exponents of the system.\nThis analog solar system is chaotic in the absence of mass loss with Lyapunov\ntime in the range 5 - 10 Myr; we find that the Lyapunov time decreases with\nincreasing stellar mass loss rate, with a nearly linear relationship between\nthe two time scales.

The cumulative effect of close and\ndistant encounters on these planetary systems are investigated using Monte\nCarlo scattering experiments. We consider two types of planetary configurations\norbiting Sun-like stars: (i) five Jupiter-mass planets in the semi-major axis\nrange 1-42 AU orbiting a Solar mass star, with orbits that are initially\nco-planar, circular, and separated by 10 mutual Hill radii, and (ii) the four\ngas giants of our Solar system. Planets with short orbital periods are not\ndirectly affected by encountering stars. However, secular evolution of\nperturbed systems may result in the ejection of the innermost planets or in\nphysical collisions of the innermost planets with the host star, up to many\nthousands of years after a stellar encounter.

{"id": "1307.0136", "contents": "Title: Spin-orbit evolution of Mercury revisited Abstract: While it is accepted that the eccentricity of Mercury (0.206) favours\nentrapment into the 3:2 spin-orbit resonance, open is the question how and when\nthe capture took place. A recent work by Makarov (2012) has demonstrated that\ntrapping into this resonance is certain if the eccentricity is larger than 0.2,\nprovided that we use a realistic tidal model, the one which is based on the\nDarwin-Kaula expansion of the tidal torque. The physics-based tidal model\nchanges dramatically the statistics of the possible final spin states. First,\nwe discover that after only one encounter with the spin-orbit 3:2 resonance\nthis resonance becomes the most probable end-state. Second, if a capture into\nthis (or any other) resonance takes place, the capture becomes final, several\ncrossings of the same state being forbidden by our model. Third, within our\nmodel the trapping of Mercury happens much faster than previously believed: for\nmost histories, 10 - 20 Myr are sufficient. Fourth, even a weak laminar\nfriction between the solid mantle and a molten core would most likely result in\na capture in the 2:1 or even higher resonance. So the principal novelty of our\npaper is that the 3:2 end-state is more ancient than the same end-state\nobtained when the constant time lag model is employed. The swift capture\njustifies our treatment of Mercury as a homogeneous, unstratified body whose\nliquid core had not yet formed by the time of trapping. We also provide a\ncritical analysis of the hypothesis by Wieczorek et al. (2012) that the early\nMercury might had been retrograde, whereafter it synchronised its spin and then\naccelerated it to the 3:2 resonance. Accurate processing of the available data\non cratering does not support that hypothesis, while the employment of a\nrealistic rheology invalidates a key element of the hypothesis, an intermediate\npseudosynchronous state needed to spin-up to the 3:2 resonance. \n\n"}

Abstract: Planetary migration is one of the most serious problems to systematically\nunderstand the observations of exoplanets. We clarify that the theoretically\npredicted type II migration is too fast, as well as type I migration, by\ndeveloping detailed analytical arguments in which the timescale of type II\nmigration is compared with the disk lifetime. In the disk-dominated regime, the\ntype II migration timescale is characterized by a {\\it local} viscous diffusion\ntimescale, while the disk lifetime characterized by a {\\it global} diffusion\ntimescale that is much longer than the local one. Even in the planet-dominated\nregime where the inertia of the planet mass reduces the migration speed, the\ntimescale is still shorter than the disk lifetime except in the final disk\nevolution stage where the total disk mass decays below the planet mass. This\nsuggests that most giant planets plunge into the central stars within the disk\nlifetime, and it contradicts the exoplanet observations that gas giants are\npiled up at $r \\ga 1$AU. We examine additional processes that may arise in\nprotoplanetary disks: dead zones, photoevaporation of gas, and gas flow across\na gap formed by a type II migrator. Although they make the type II migration\ntimescale closer to the disk lifetime, we show that none of them can act as an\neffective barrier for rapid type II migration with the current knowledge of\nthese processes. We point out that gas flow across a gap and the fraction of\nthe flow accreted onto the planets are uncertain and they may have a potential\nto solve the problem. Much more detailed investigation for each process may be\nneeded to explain the observed distribution of gas giants in extrasolar\nplanetary systems. \n\n"}

We aim to measure the stability of Kepler measurements\nover years of observations. We present a study of the depth of about 500\ntransit events of the Hot Jupiter HAT-P-7b, using 14 quarters (Q0-Q13) of data\nfrom the Kepler Satellite.

This makes analytic\npredictions for a range of quantities including: distributions of grain\ndensities, power spectra and correlation functions of fluctuations, and maximum\ngrain densities reached. We predict how these scale as a function of grain drag\ntime t_stop, spatial scale, grain-to-gas mass ratio, strength of turbulence\n(alpha), and detailed disk properties. We test these against numerical\nsimulations with various turbulence-driving mechanisms. The simulations agree\nwell with the predictions, spanning t_stop*Omega ~ 1e-4 - 10, alpha ~ 1e-10 -\n1e-2, and grain-to-gas mass ratio ~0-3. Results from 'turbulent concentration'\nsimulations and laboratory experiments are also predicted as a special case.\nVortices on a wide range of scales disperse and concentrate grains\nhierarchically.

This means that the effects of\nrotation on atmospheric dynamics will be relatively weak, which requires small\nhorizontal temperature gradients above the boundary layer of terrestrial\natmospheres. An analytically solvable and dynamically consistent model for\nplanetary climate with only three free parameters can be constructed by making\nthe weak temperature gradient (WTG) approximation, which assumes temperatures\nare horizontally uniform aloft. The extreme numerical efficiency of a WTG model\ncompared to a 3D general circulation model (GCM) makes it an optimal tool for\nMonte Carlo fits to observables over parameter space. Additionally, such\nlow-order models are critical for developing physical intuition and coupling\natmospheric dynamics to models of other components of planetary climate. The\nobjective of this paper is to determine whether a WTG model provides an\nadequate approximation of the effect of atmospheric dynamics on quantities\nlikely to be observed over the next decade. To do this we first tune a WTG\nmodel to GCM output for an Earth-like tidally locked planet with a dry, 1 bar\natmosphere, then generate and compare the expected phase curves of both models.\nWe find that differences between the two models would be extremely difficult to\ndetect from phase curves using JWST.

In particular we propose that the MWA can be used\nas an element of a passive radar facility operating in the frequency range 87.5\n- 108 MHz (the commercial FM broadcast band). In this scenario the MWA can be\nconsidered the receiving element in a bi-static radar configuration, with FM\nbroadcast stations serving as non-cooperative transmitters. The FM broadcasts\npropagate into space, are reflected off debris in Earth orbit, and are received\nat the MWA.

However, the formation of larger bodies\nfrom the so-formed building blocks is not yet fully understood.

Gravitational perturbations from the companion are expected\nto excite high planetesimal eccentricities resulting in destruction, rather\nthan growth, of objects with sizes of up to several hundred km in collisions of\nsimilar-size bodies. It was recently suggested that gravity of a massive\naxisymmetric gaseous disk in which planetesimals are embedded drives rapid\nprecession of their orbits, suppressing eccentricity excitation. However, disks\nin binaries are themselves expected to be eccentric, leading to additional\nplanetesimal excitation. Here we develop secular theory of eccentricity\nevolution for planetesimals perturbed by the gravity of an elliptical\nprotoplanetary disk (neglecting gas drag) and the companion. For the first time\nwe derive an expression for the disturbing function due to an eccentric disk,\nwhich can be used for a variety of other astrophysical problems.

The\nabsolute flux calibration is tied to the photospheric models of five fiducial\nstellar standards (alpha Boo, alpha Cet, alpha Tau, beta And, gamma Dra). The\ndata processing steps to arrive at a consistent and homogeneous calibration are\noutlined. In the current state the relative photometric accuracy is around 2%\nin all bands. Starting from the present calibration status, the\ncharacterization and correction for instrumental effects affecting the relative\ncalibration accuracy is described and an outlook for the final achievable\ncalibration numbers is given. After including all the correction for the\ninstrumental effects, the relative photometric calibration accuracy\n(repeatability) will be as good as 0.5% in the blue and green band and 2% in\nthe red band. This excellent calibration starts to reveal possible\ninconsistencies between the models of the K-type and the M-type stellar\ncalibrators. The absolute calibration accuracy is therefore mainly limited by\nthe 5% uncertainty of the celestial standard models in all three bands. The\nPACS bolometer response was extremely stable over the entire Herschel mission\nand a single, time-independent response calibration file is sufficient for the\nprocessing and calibration of the science observations. The dedicated\nmeasurements of the internal calibration sources were needed only to\ncharacterize secondary effects. No aging effects of the bolometer or the\nfilters have been found. Also, we found no signs of filter leaks. The PACS\nphotometric system is very well characterized with a constant energy spectrum\nnu*Fnu = lambda*Flambda = const as a reference.

Within the context of this picture, significant\norbital obliquities characteristic of a substantial fraction of such planets\ncan be attributed to external torques that perturb the disks out of alignment\nwith the spin axes of their host stars. Therefore, the acquisition of orbital\nobliquity exhibits sensitive dependence on the physics of disk-star\ninteractions. Here, we analyze the primordial excitation of spin-orbit\nmisalignment of Sun-like stars, in light of disk-star angular momentum\ntransfer. We begin by calculating the stellar pre-main sequence rotational\nevolution, accounting for spin-up due to gravitational contraction and\naccretion as well as spin-down due to magnetic star-disk coupling. We devote\nparticular attention to angular momentum transfer by accretion, and show that\nwhile generally subdominant to gravitational contraction, this process is\nlargely controlled by the morphology of the stellar magnetic field (i.e.\nspecific angular momentum accreted by stars with octupole-dominated surface\nfields is smaller than that accreted by dipole-dominated stars by an order of\nmagnitude). Subsequently, we examine the secular spin-axis dynamics of\ndisk-bearing stars, accounting for the time-evolution of stellar and disk\nproperties and demonstrate that misalignments are preferentially excited in\nsystems where stellar rotation is not overwhelmingly rapid. Moreover, we show\nthat the excitation of spin-orbit misalignment occurs impulsively, through an\nencounter with a resonance between the stellar precession frequency and the\ndisk-torquing frequency. Cumulatively, the model developed herein opens up a\npreviously unexplored avenue towards understanding star-disk evolution and its\nconsequences in a unified manner. \n\n"}

While the isotopic compositions of low-density\ngraphite grains indicate an origin in core-collapse supernovae, some\nhigh-density grains have extreme isotopic anomalies in C, Ca and Ti, which\ncannot be explained by envelope predictions of asymptotic giant branch (AGB)\nstars or theoretical supernova models. The Ca and Ti isotopic anomalies,\nhowever, match the predictions of He-shell abundances in AGB stars. In this\nstudy, we show that the C, Ca, and Ti isotopic anomalies are consistent with\nnucleosynthesis predictions of the H-ingestion phase during a very late thermal\npulse (VLTP) event in post-AGB stars. The low $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C isotopic ratios\nin these grains are a result of abundant $^{12}$C efficiently capturing the\nprotons that are being ingested during the VLTP. Very high neutron densities of\n$\\sim 10^{15}$ cm$^{-3}$, typical of the $i$-process, are achieved during this\nphase in post-AGB stars. The large $^{42,43,44}$Ca excesses in some graphite\ngrains are indicative of neutron capture nucleosynthesis during VLTP.

I.\n  Steady Solutions and an Upper Limit on the Vertical Field Strength Abstract: Large-scale magnetic fields are key ingredients of magnetically driven disk\naccretion. We study how large-scale poloidal fields evolve in accretion disks,\nwith the primary aim of quantifying the viability of magnetic accretion\nmechanisms in protoplanetary disks. We employ a kinematic mean-field model for\npoloidal field transport and focus on steady states where inward advection of a\nfield balances with outward diffusion due to effective resistivities. We\nanalytically derive the steady-state radial distribution of poloidal fields in\nhighly conducting accretion disks. The analytic solution reveals an upper limit\non the strength of large-scale vertical fields attainable in steady states. Any\nexcess poloidal field will be diffused away within a finite time, and we\ndemonstrate this with time-dependent numerical calculations of the mean-field\nequations. We apply this upper limit to large-scale vertical fields threading\nprotoplanetary disks. We find that the maximum attainable strength is about 0.1\nG at 1 AU, and about 1 mG at 10 AU from the central star. When combined with\nrecent magnetic accretion models, the maximum field strength translates into\nthe maximum steady-state accretion rate of $\\sim 10^{-7} M_\\odot {\\rm\nyr}^{-1}$, in agreement with observations. We also find that the maximum field\nstrength is ~ 1 kG at the surface of the central star provided that the disk\nextends down to the stellar surface.

For the trial problem, the algorithm returns\nthe correct fully marginalized likelihood, and the estimated uncertainty is\nalso consistent with the standard deviation of results from multiple runs.

Wind\n  Solutions at the Inner Disk Abstract: The gas dynamics of protoplanetary disks (PPDs) is largely controlled by\nnon-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects including Ohmic resistivity, the\nHall effect and ambipolar diffusion. Among these the role of the Hall effect is\nthe least explored and most poorly understood. We have included all three\nnon-ideal MHD effects in a self-consistent manner to investigate the role of\nthe Hall effect on PPD gas dynamics using local shearing-box simulations. In\nthis first paper, we focus on the inner region of PPDs, where previous studies\nexcluding the Hall effect have revealed that the inner disk up to ~10 AU is\nlargely laminar, with accretion driven by a magnetocentrifugal wind. We confirm\nthis basic picture and show that the Hall effect introduces modest\nmodifications to the wind solutions, depending on the polarity of the\nlarge-scale poloidal magnetic field B_0 threading the disk. When B_0.Omega>0,\nthe horizontal magnetic field is strongly amplified toward the disk interior,\nleading to a stronger disk wind (by ~50% or less in terms of the wind-driven\naccretion rate). The enhanced horizontal field also leads to much stronger\nlarge-scale Maxwell stress (magnetic braking) that contributes to a\nconsiderable fraction of the wind-driven accretion rate. When B_0.Omega<0, the\nhorizontal magnetic field is reduced, leading to a weaker disk wind (by ~20%)\nand negligible magnetic braking.

The parameters used to define the\npresence of non-Gaussianity are zero for Gaussian processes, giving a simple\nmethod of defining the strength of non-Gaussian behaviour.

Under strong assumptions,\nexoplanet catalogs have been used to make an extrapolated estimate of the rate\nat which Sun-like stars host Earth analogs. These studies are complicated by\nthe fact that every catalog is censored by non-trivial selection effects and\ndetection efficiencies, and every property (period, radius, etc.) is measured\nnoisily. Here we present a general hierarchical probabilistic framework for\nmaking justified inferences about the population of exoplanets, taking into\naccount survey completeness and, for the first time, observational\nuncertainties.

The orbital\ninclination of Iapetus to the local Laplace plane is ~8 deg, which is\nunexpected, because the inclination should be ~0 if Iapetus formed from a\ncircumplanetary disk on the Laplace surface. It thus appears that some process\nhas pumped up Iapetus's inclination while leaving its eccentricity near zero\n(e=0.03 at present). Here we examined the possibility that Iapetus's\ninclination was excited during the early solar system instability when\nencounters between Saturn and ice giants occurred. We found that the dynamical\neffects of planetary encounters on Iapetus's orbit sensitively depend on the\ndistance of the few closest encounters. In four out of ten instability cases\nstudied here, the orbital perturbations were too large to be plausible. In one\ncase, Iapetus's orbit was practically unneffected. In the remaining five cases,\nthe perturbations of Iapetus's inclination were adequate to explain its present\nvalue. In three of these cases, however, Iapetus's eccentricity was excited to\n0.1-0.25, and it is not clear whether it could have been damped to its present\nvalue (0.03) by some subsequent process (e.g., tides and dynamical friction\nfrom captured irregular satellites do not seem to be strong enough).

We study the impact of the presence of planets on the lithium abundance\nof host stars and evaluate the previous claim that planet hosts exhibit lithium\ndepletion when compared to their non-host counterparts.\n  Methods. Using previously published lithium abundances, we remove the\nconfounding effect of the different fundamental stellar parameters by applying\na multivariable regression on our dataset. In doing so, we explicitly make an\nassumption made implicitly by different authors: that lithium abundance depends\nlinearly on fundamental stellar parameters. Using a moderator variable to\ndistinguish stars with planets from those without, we evaluate the existence of\nan offset in lithium abundances between the two groups. We perform this\nanalysis first for stars that present a clear lithium detection exclusively and\ninclude in a second analysis upper lithium measurements.\n  Results. Our analysis shows that under the above-mentioned assumption of\nlinearity, a statistically significant negative offset in lithium abundance\nbetween planet hosts and non-hosts is recovered. We concluded that an inflation\non the lithium uncertainty estimations by a factor of larger than 5 is required\nto render the measured offset compatible with zero at less than 3-4 {\\sigma}\nand make it non-significant. We demonstrated that the offset as delivered by\nour method depends on the different nature of the stars in the two samples.

All three\nnon-ideal MHD effects, Ohmic resistivity, the Hall effect and ambipolar\ndiffusion are included in a self-consistent manner based on equilibrium\nchemistry. We focus on regions toward outer disk radii, from 5-60AU, where\nOhmic resistivity tends to become negligible, ambipolar diffusion dominates\nover an extended region across disk height, and the Hall effect largely\ncontrols the dynamics near the disk midplane. We find that around R=5AU, the\nsystem launches a laminar/weakly turbulent magnetocentrifugal wind when the net\nvertical field Bz is not too weak, as expected. Moreover, the wind is able to\nachieve and maintain a configuration with reflection symmetry at disk midplane.\nThe case with anti-aligned field polarity (Omega. Bz<0) is more susceptible to\nthe MRI when Bz drops, leading to an outflow oscillating in radial directions\nand very inefficient angular momentum transport. At the outer disk around and\nbeyond R=30AU, the system shows vigorous MRI turbulence in the surface layer\ndue to far-UV ionization, which efficiently drives disk accretion. The Hall\neffect affects the stability of the midplane region to the MRI, leading to\nstrong/weak Maxwell stress for aligned/anti-aligned field polarities.\nNevertheless, the midplane region is only very weakly turbulent. Overall, the\nbasic picture is analogous to the conventional layered accretion scenario\napplied to the outer disk.

This involves the existence of a\npressure maximum which traps dust either in between two gap-opening planets or\nat the outermost gap edge of a single or multiple planet system, combined with\nthe decoupling of large dust particles from the gas. We perform 2D gas\nhydrodynamical simulations of disks with one and two giant planets which may\nopen deep or partial gaps. A gas ring forms in between two planets such that\nthe surface mass density is higher than on either side of it. This ring is a\nregion of pressure maximum where we expect large grains, which are marginally\ncoupled to the gas and would otherwise be subject to radial drift, to collect.\nSuch a pressure maximum also occurs at the outermost gap edge in a disk with\none or more planets. We infer the dust evolution in these regions as the gas\ndisk evolves, to understand the longer term behavior of the resulting dust\nrings. Over time the gas surface density in the ring(s) decreases, which may\ncause the larger trapped particles to decouple. Consequently, these particles\nare expected to stay in ring structure(s) longer than the gas.

We propose that these remarkable ALMA observations---which may bear\non how planetesimals form---reflect a gravitational global mode in the gas\ndisk.

We solve for gas streamlines including the\nindirect stellar potential in the frame rotating with the pattern speed, under\nthe drastic simplification that gas does not feel its own gravity. Near\nco-rotation, the gas disk takes the form of a horseshoe-shaped annulus. Dust\nparticles with aerodynamic stopping times much shorter or much longer than the\norbital period are dragged by gas toward the horseshoe center. For intermediate\nstopping times, dust converges toward a $\\sim$45$^\\circ$-wide arc on the\nco-rotation circle.

Furthermore, this probability rapidly approaches zero at increasing\norbital period. Therefore transit surveys have been predominantly limited to\nthe inner parts of exoplanetary systems. Here we demonstrate how circumbinary\nplanets allow us to beat these unfavourable odds. By incorporating the geometry\nand the three-body dynamics of circumbinary systems, we analytically derive the\nprobability of transitability, a configuration where the binary and planet\norbits overlap on the sky. We later show that this is equivalent to the transit\nprobability, but at an unspecified point in time. This probability, at its\nminimum, is always higher than for single star cases. In addition, it is an\nincreasing function with mutual inclination. By applying our analytical\ndevelopment to eclipsing binaries, we deduce that transits are highly probable,\nand in some case guaranteed. For example, a circumbinary planet revolving at 1\nAU around a 0.3 AU eclipsing binary is certain to eventually transit - a 100%\nprobability - if its mutual inclination is greater than 0.6 deg. We show that\nthe transit probability is generally only a weak function of the planet's\norbital period; circumbinary planets may be used as practical tools for probing\nthe outer regions of exoplanetary systems to search for and detect warm to cold\ntransiting planets. \n\n"}

In preliminary\nanalyses of the Herschel DEBRIS and DUNES surveys, Wyatt et al. (2012) and\nMarshall et al. (2014) identified a tentative correlation between debris and\nlow-mass planets. Here we use the cleanest possible sample out these surveys to\nassess the presence of such a correlation, discarding stars without known ages,\nwith ages < 1 Gyr and with binary companions <100 AU, to rule out possible\ncorrelations due to effects other than planet presence. In our sample of 204\nFGK stars, we do not find evidence that debris disks are more common or more\ndusty around stars harboring high-mass or low-mass planets compared to a\ncontrol sample without identified planets, nor that debris disks are more or\nless common (or more or less dusty) around stars harboring multiple planets\ncompared to single-planet systems.

We use a state-of-the-art simulation of the SKA Phase 1\nobservations complete with cosmological signal, foregrounds and\nfrequency-dependent instrumental effects to test both parametric and\nnon-parametric foreground removal methods.

Yet the connection between\nhost star metallicity and the properties of small planets is only just\nbeginning to be investigated. It has recently been argued that the metallicity\ndistribution of stars with exoplanet candidates identified by Kepler provides\nevidence for three distinct clusters of exoplanets, distinguished by planet\nradius boundaries at 1.7 R_Earth and 3.9 R_Earth. This would suggest that there\nare three distinct planet formation pathways for super-Earths, mini-Neptunes,\nand giant planets. However, as I show through three independent analyses, there\nis actually no evidence for the proposed radius boundary at 1.7 R_Earth. On the\nother hand, a more rigorous calculation demonstrates that a single, continuous\nrelationship between planet radius and metallicity is a better fit to the data.\nThe planet radius and metallicity data therefore provides no evidence for\ndistinct categories of small planets. This suggests that the planet formation\nprocess in a typical protoplanetary disk produces a continuum of planet sizes\nbetween 1 R_Earth and 4 R_Earth.

Confronted with a transit\nlightcurve, some authors fix the parameters of these laws, the so-called\nlimb-darkening coefficients (LDCs), while others prefer to let them float in\nthe lightcurve fitting procedure. Which of these is the best strategy, however,\nis still unclear, as well as how and by how much each of these can bias the\nretrieved transit parameters. In this work we attempt to clarify those points\nby first re-calculating these LDCs, comparing them to measured values from\nKepler transit lightcurves using an algorithm that takes into account\nuncertainties in both the geometry of the transit and the parameters of the\nstellar host. We show there are significant departures from predicted model\nvalues, suggesting that our understanding of limb-darkening still needs to\nimprove.

For a type-I planet, which\nis formed beyond a certain critical distance from the host star, the thermal\nemission declines on a timescale shorter than approximately $10^6$ years.\nTherefore, young stars should be targets when searching for molten planets in\nthis orbital region. In contrast, a type-II planet, which is formed inside the\ncritical distance, will emit significant thermal radiation from near-infrared\natmospheric windows during the entire lifetime of the magma ocean. The Ks and L\nbands will be favorable for future direct imaging because the planet-to-star\ncontrasts of these bands are higher than approximately 10$^{-7}$-10$^{-8}$.

As a result, the\ngeneralized momenta and energy (Noether current) evolutions are well-tracked.\nWe discuss several example systems, including damped harmonic oscillators,\nPoynting-Robertson drag, and gravitational radiation reaction, by utilizing our\nnew publicly available code to demonstrate the slimplectic integrator\nalgorithm.\n  Slimplectic integrators are well-suited for integrations of systems where\nnonconservative effects play an important role in the long-term dynamical\nevolution. As such they are particularly appropriate for cosmological or\ncelestial N-body dynamics problems where nonconservative interactions, e.g. gas\ninteractions or dissipative tides, can play an important role. \n\n"}

We construct\nnovel analytical models of systems in chemical equilibrium that include carbon\nmonoxide, carbon dioxide, water, methane and acetylene and relate the\nequilibrium constants of the chemical reactions to temperature and pressure via\nthe tabulated Gibbs free energies. We prove that such chemical systems may be\ndescribed by a quintic equation for the mixing ratio of methane. By examining\nthe abundances of these molecules across a broad range of temperatures\n(spanning equilibrium temperatures from 600 to 2500 K), pressures (via\ntemperature-pressure profiles that explore albedo and opacity variations) and\ncarbon-to-oxygen ratios, we conclude that carbon dioxide is subdominant\ncompared to carbon monoxide and water. Atmospheric mixing does not alter this\nconclusion if carbon dioxide is subdominant everywhere in the atmosphere.\nCarbon dioxide and carbon monoxide may attain comparable abundances if the\nmetallicity is greatly enhanced, but this property is negated by temperatures\nabove 1000 K. For hydrogen-dominated atmospheres, our generic result has the\nimplication that retrieval studies may wish to set the subdominance of carbon\ndioxide as a prior of the calculation and not let its abundance completely roam\nfree as a fitting parameter, because it directly affects the inferred value of\nthe carbon-to-oxygen ratio and may produce unphysical conclusions.

The disc itself evolves on time-scales of several Myr during which\nboth temperature and density profiles change as matter accretes onto the\ncentral star. Here we use a detailed model of an evolving disc to determine the\ngrowth of planets by pebble accretion and their migration through the disc.\nCores that reach their pebble isolation mass accrete gas to finally form giant\nplanets with extensive gas envelopes, while planets that do not reach pebble\nisolation mass are stranded as ice giants and ice planets containing only minor\namounts of gas in their envelopes. Unlike earlier population synthesis models,\nour model works without any artificial reductions in migration speed and for\nprotoplanetary discs with gas and dust column densities similar to those\ninferred from observations. We find that in our nominal disc model the\nemergence of planetary embryos preferably occurs after approximately 2 Myr in\norder to not exclusively form gas giants, but also ice giants and smaller\nplanets. The high pebble accretion rates ensure that critical core masses for\ngas accretion can be reached at all orbital distances. Gas giant planets\nnevertheless experience significant reduction in semi-major axes by migration.\nConsidering instead planetesimal accretion for planetary growth, we show that\nformation time-scales are too long to compete with the migration time-scales\nand the dissipation time of the protoplanetary disc. Altogether, we find that\npebble accretion overcomes many of the challenges in the formation of ice and\ngas giants in evolving protoplanetary discs. \n\n"}

{"id": "1508.07817", "contents": "Title: Fast migration of low-mass planets in radiative discs Abstract: Low-mass planets are known to undergo Type I migration and this process must\nhave played a key role during the evolution of planetary systems. Analytical\nformulae for the disc torque have been derived assuming that the planet evolves\non a fixed circular orbit. However, recent work has shown that in isothermal\ndiscs, a migrating protoplanet may also experience dynamical corotation torques\nthat scale with the planet drift rate. The aim of this study is to examine\nwhether dynamical corotation torques can also affect the migration of low-mass\nplanets in non-isothermal discs. We performed 2D radiative hydrodynamical\nsimulations to examine the orbital evolution outcome of migrating protoplanets\nas a function of disc mass. We find that a protoplanet can enter a fast\nmigration regime when it migrates in the direction set by the entropy-related\nhorseshoe drag and when the Toomre stability parameter is less than a threshold\nvalue below which the horseshoe region contracts into a tadpole-like region. In\nthat case, an underdense trapped region appears near the planet, with an\nentropy excess compared to the ambient disc. If the viscosity and thermal\ndiffusivity are small enough so that the entropy excess is conserved during\nmigration, the planet then experiences strong corotation torques arising from\nthe material flowing across the planet orbit. During fast migration, we observe\nthat a protoplanet can pass through the zero-torque line predicted by static\ntorques. We also find that fast migration may help in disrupting the\nmean-motion resonances that are formed by convergent migration of embryos. \n\n"}

After the failure of two reaction wheels, the Kepler satellite\nhas been repurposed as Kepler-2 (K2), observing fields close to the ecliptic\nplane. As these fields contain many more bright stars than the original Kepler\nfield, K2 provides an unprecedented opportunity to study nearby objects\namenable to detailed follow-up with ground-based instruments. Due to bandwidth\nconstraints, only a small fraction of pixels can be downloaded, with the result\nthat most bright stars which saturate the detector are not observed. We show\nthat engineering data acquired for photometric calibration, consisting of\ncollateral `smear' measurements, can be used to reconstruct light curves for\nbright targets not otherwise observable with Kepler/K2.

This concept, called as\ndensified pupil spectroscopy, allows us to perform high, stable\nspectrophotometry against telescope pointing jitter and deformation of the\nprimary mirror. This densified pupil spectrometer comprises the following three\nroles: division of a pupil into a number of sub-pupils, densification of each\nsub-pupil, and acquisition of the spectrum of each sub-pupil with a\nconventional spectrometer. Focusing on the fact that the divided and densified\nsub-pupil can be treated as a point source, we discovered that a simplified\nspectrometer allows us to acquire the spectra of the densified sub-pupils on\nthe detector plane-an optical conjugate with the primary mirror-by putting the\ndivided and densified sub-pupils on the entrance slit of the spectrometer. The\nacquired multiple spectra are not principally moved on the detector against\nlow-order aberrations such as the telescope pointing jitter and any deformation\nof the primary mirror.

When only the indirect force is\nincluded, we confirm the finding by Mittal & Chiang (2015) that the vortex\nbecomes stronger and can be more than two pressure scale heights wide, as long\nas the disc-to-star mass ratio is >1%. Such wide vortices can excite strong\ndensity waves in the disc and therefore migrate inwards rapidly. However, when\ndisc self-gravity is also considered in simulations, self-gravity plays a more\nprominent role on the vortex structure. We confirm that when the disc Toomre Q\nparameter is smaller than pi/(2h), where h is the disc's aspect ratio, the\nvortices are significantly weakened and their inward migration slows down\ndramatically. Most importantly, when the disc is massive enough (e.g. Q~3), we\nfind that the lopsided gas structure orbits around the star at a speed\nsignificantly slower than the local Keplerian speed.

HD 189733b is arguably the most well observed exoplanet\nto date and the only exoplanet to be observed in polarized light, yet it is\ndebated if the planet's atmosphere is cloudy or clear. We model reflected light\nfrom clear atmospheres with Rayleigh scattering, and cloudy or hazy atmospheres\nwith Mie and fractal aggregate particles. We show that clear and cloudy\natmospheres have large differences in polarized light as compared to simple\nflux measurements, though existing observations are insufficient to make this\ndistinction. Futhermore, we show that atmospheres that are spatially\ninhomogeneous, such as being partially covered by clouds or hazes, exhibit\nlarger contrasts in polarized light when compared to clear atmospheres.

By combining the new\nHerschel spectra with archival Spitzer-IRS spectroscopy, we retrieve a\nparameterized radial surface water vapor distribution from 0.1-100 AU using\ntwo-dimensional dust and line radiative transfer modeling. The surface water\ndistribution is modeled with a step model comprising of a constant inner and\nouter relative water abundance and a critical radius at which the surface water\nabundance is allowed to change. We find that the four disks have critical radii\nof $\\sim 3-11$ AU, at which the surface water abundance decreases by at least 5\norders of magnitude. The measured values for the critical radius are\nconsistently smaller than the location of the surface snow line, as predicted\nby the observed spectral energy distribution. This suggests that the sharp\ndrop-off of the surface water abundance is not solely due to the local\ngas-solid balance, but may also be driven by the de-activation of gas-phase\nchemical pathways to water below 300 K. Assuming a canonical gas-to-dust ratio\nof 100, as well as coupled gas and dust temperatures $T_{\\rm gas}=T_{\\rm\ndust}$, the best-fit inner water abundances become implausibly high (0.01-1.0\n${\\rm H_{2}}^{-1}$). Conversely, a model in which the gas and dust temperatures\nare decoupled leads to canonical inner disk water abundances of $\\sim 10^{-4}\n\\rm H_{2}^{-1}$, while retaining gas-to-dust ratios of 100.

The ion subsystem may be solid, liquid or plasma, with\nmany states of ionization with ionic charge $Z_j$. Quasi-equilibria with the\nion temperature $T_i\\ne T_e$ are common. The ion subsystem in WCM can no longer\nbe treated as a passive \"external potential\", as is customary in $T=0$ density\nfunctional theory (DFT) dominated by solid-state theory or quantum chemistry.\nHohenberg-Kohn-Mermin theory can be used for WCMs if finite-$T$\nexchange-correlation (XC) functionals are available. They are functionals of\nboth the one-body electron density $n_e$ and the one-body ion densities\n$\\rho_j$. A method of approximately but accurately mapping the quantum\nelectrons to a classical Coulomb gas enables one to treat electron-ion systems\nentirely classically at any temperature and arbitrary spin polarization, using\nexchange-correlation effects calculated {\\it in situ}, directly from the\npair-distribution functions.

This cannot be explained\nby observational biases because many Neptunian planets with longer orbital\nperiods have been detected. The existence of this desert is similar to the\nappearance of the so-called brown-dwarf desert that suggests different\nformation mechanisms of planets and stellar companions with short orbital\nperiods. Similarly, the Neptunian desert might indicate different mechanisms of\nformation and evolution for hot Jupiters and short-period super-Earths. We here\nfollow a previous study and examine the location and shape of the desert in\nboth the period-mass and period-radius planes, using the currently available\nlarge samples of planets. The desert in the period-mass plane has a relatively\nsharp upper edge, with a planetary mass that is inversely proportional to the\nplanetary orbital period, while the lower, somewhat blurred, boundary is\nlocated along masses that are apparently linearly proportional to the period.\nThe desert in the period-radius plane of the transiting planets is less clear.\nIt seems as if the radius along the upper boundary is inversely proportional to\nthe period to the power of one-third, while the lower boundary shows a radius\nthat is proportional to the period to the power of two-thirds.

We show that the majority of the observed Jupiter\npairs (twenty out of twenty-four) will be dynamically unstable if the inner\nplanet was placed at >~1AU distance from the stellar host. This finding is at\nodds with formation theories that invoke the migration of such planets from\nsemi-major axes >~1AU due to secular dynamical processes (e.g., secular chaos,\nLidov-Kozai oscillations) coupled with tidal dissipation. In fact, the results\nof N-body integrations show that the evolution of dynamically unstable systems\ndoes not lead to tidal migration but rather to planet ejections and collisions\nwith the host star.

Our results show that, the Laplace resonance contains two different\nregions: an inner domain characterized by low chaoticity and slow diffusion,\nand an outer one displaying larger values of dynamical indicators. In the outer\nresonant domain, the stochastic borders of the Laplace resonance seem to\nprevent the complete destruction of the system.

The problem\naddressed by the resolution is a lack of established conversion constants\nbetween solar and planetary values and SI units: a missing standard has caused\na proliferation of solar values (e.g., solar radius, solar irradiance, solar\nluminosity, solar effective temperature and solar mass parameter) in the\nliterature, with cited solar values typically based on best estimates at the\ntime of paper writing. As precision of observations increases, a set of\nconsistent values becomes increasingly important.

Our M-dwarf radial velocity\nmonitoring with HARPS-N can provide a major contribution to the widening of the\ncurrent statistics through the in-depth analysis of accurate radial velocity\nobservations in a narrow range of spectral sub-types (79 stars, between dM0 to\ndM3).

Chemical\nkinetics models have been widely used in the literature to investigate the\nchemical compositions of hot Jupiter atmospheres which are expected to be\ndriven away from chemical equilibrium via processes such as vertical mixing and\nphotochemistry. All of these models have so far used pressure--temperature\n(P-T) profiles as fixed model input. This results in a decoupling of the\nchemistry from the radiative and thermal properties of the atmosphere, despite\nthe fact that in nature they are intricately linked. We use a one-dimensional\nradiative-convective equilibrium model, ATMO, which includes a sophisticated\nchemistry scheme to calculate P-T profiles which are fully consistent with\nnon-equilibrium chemical abundances, including vertical mixing and\nphotochemistry. Our primary conclusion is that, in cases of strong chemical\ndisequilibrium, consistent calculations can lead to differences in the P-T\nprofile of up to 100 K compared to the P-T profile derived assuming chemical\nequilibrium. This temperature change can, in turn, have important consequences\nfor the chemical abundances themselves as well as for the simulated emission\nspectra. In particular, we find that performing the chemical kinetics\ncalculation consistently can reduce the overall impact of non-equilibrium\nchemistry on the observable emission spectrum of hot Jupiters. Simulated\nobservations derived from non-consistent models could thus yield the wrong\ninterpretation. We show that this behaviour is due to the non-consistent models\nviolating the energy budget balance of the atmosphere. \n\n"}

By\ncombining direct numerical simulations of the full magnetohydrodynamics\nequations with the helical Fourier decomposition we numerically confirm that in\nthe kinematic dynamo regime the system develops a large-scale magnetic helicity\nwith opposite sign compared to the small-scale kinetic helicity, a sort of\ntriad-by-triad $\\alpha$-effect in Fourier space. Concerning the small-scale\nperturbations, we predict theoretically and confirm numerically that the\nlargest instability is achieved for the magnetic component with the same\nhelicity of the flow, in agreement with the Stretch-Twist-Fold mechanism.

Although the a-priori\nprobability that Proxima b transits its parent star is just 1.5%, the potential\nimpact of such a discovery would be considerable. Independent of recent radial\nvelocity efforts, we observed Proxima Centauri for 12.5 days in 2014 and 31\ndays in 2015 with the MOST space telescope.

This allows\nus to map physical quantities (scattering radius and scattering angle) onto\nscattered light images and retrieve stellar irradiation corrected (r^2-scaled)\nimages and dust phase functions. We apply the method on archival polarized\nintensity images of the protoplanetary disk around HD 100546 that were obtained\nwith VLT/SPHERE in R'-band and VLT/NACO in H- and Ks-band. The brightest side\nof the r^2-scaled R'-band polarized intensity image of HD 100546 changes from\nthe far to the near side of the disk when a flaring instead of a geometrically\nflat disk surface is used for the r^2-scaling.

We classify six regions in the\nplanet's mass versus semimajor axis parameter space according to the dominant\noutcome for scattered objects: ejected, accreted, remaining, escaping, Oort\nCloud, depleted Oort Cloud. We use these outcomes to consider which planetary\nsystem architectures maximise the observability of specific signatures, given\nthat signatures should be detected first around systems with optimal\narchitectures (if such systems exist in nature). Giant impact debris is most\nreadily detectable for 0.1-10Mearth planets at 1-5au, depending on detection\nmethod and spectral type. While A stars have putative giant impact debris at\n4-6au consistent with this sweet spot, that of FGK stars is typically <<1au\ncontrary to expectations; an absence of 1-3au giant impact debris could\nindicate a low frequency of terrestrial planets there. Three principles\nmaximise cometary influx from exo-Kuiper belts: a chain of closely separated\nplanets interior to the belt, none of which is a Jupiter-like ejector; planet\nmasses not increasing strongly with distance (for a net inward torque on\ncomets); ongoing replenishment of comets, possibly by embedded low-mass\nplanets. A high Oort Cloud comet influx requires no ejector and architectures\nthat maximise the Oort Cloud population. Cold debris disks are usually\nconsidered classical Kuiper belt analogues.

I use numerical simulations of gas clumps embedded\nin massive gas discs to show that these observations are consistent with $\\sim\n0.2 - 10$ planetary mass clumps per star being born in young gravitationally\nunstable discs. A trio of processes -- rapid clump migration, tidal disruption\nand runaway gas accretion -- destroys or transforms all of the simulated clumps\ninto other objects, resulting in a desert of gas giants beyond separation of\napproximately 10 au. The cooling rate of the disc controls which of the three\nprocesses is dominant.

The star is\nbehind, or embedded in, the $\\rho$ Ophiuchus molecular cloud, and obscured by\n28 magnitudes of extinction at optical wavelengths by the foreground cloud.\nMid-IR polarization of WL 16, mainly arises from aligned elongated dust grains\npresent along the line of sight, suggesting a uniform morphology of\npolarization vectors with an orientation of 33\\degr (East from North) and a\npolarization fraction of $\\sim$ 2.0\\%. This orientation is consistent with\nprevious polarimetric surveys in the optical and near-IR bands to probe\nlarge-scale magnetic fields in the Ophiuchus star formation region, indicating\nthat the observed mid-IR polarization toward WL 16 is produced by the dichroic\nabsorption of magnetically aligned foreground dust grains by a uniform magnetic\nfield. Using polarizations of WL 16 and Elias 29, a nearby polarization\nstandard star, we constrain the polarization efficiency,\n\\textit{$p_{10.3}/A_{10.3}$}, for the dust grains in the $\\rho$ Ophiuchus\nmolecular cloud to be $\\sim$ 1.0\\% mag$^{-1}$. WL 16 has polycyclic aromatic\nhydrocarbon (PAH) emission features detected at 8.6, 11.2, 12.0, and 12.7\n$\\mu$m by our spectroscopic data, and we find an anti-correlation between the\nPAH surface brightness and the PAH ionization fraction between the NW and SW\nsides of the disk. \n\n"}

We consider a complete sample of over 200,000\npublications from 1950 to 2015 from five major astronomy journals. We determine\nthe gender of the first author for over 70% of all publications. The fraction\nof papers which have a female first author has increased from less than 5% in\nthe 1960s to about 25% today. We find that the increase of the fraction of\npapers authored by females is slowest in the most prestigious journals such as\nScience and Nature. Furthermore, female authors write 19$\\pm$7% fewer papers in\nseven years following their first paper than their male colleagues. At all\ntimes papers with male first authors receive more citations than papers with\nfemale first authors.

We obtained high-precision radial velocities with HARPS on the ESO\n3.6 m telescope and determined precise stellar elemental abundances (~0.01 dex)\nusing MIKE spectra on the Magellan 6.5m telescope. [Results]. Our data indicate\nthe presence of a planet with a minimum mass of 26 Earth masses around the\nsolar twin HIP 68468. The planet is a super-Neptune, but unlike the distant\nNeptune in our solar system (30 AU), HIP 68468c is close-in, with a semi-major\naxis of 0.66 AU, similar to that of Venus. The data also suggest the presence\nof a super-Earth with a minimum mass of 2.9 Earth masses at 0.03 AU; if the\nplanet is confirmed, it will be the fifth least massive radial velocity planet\ndiscovery to date and the first super-Earth around a solar twin. Both\nisochrones (5.9 Gyr) and the abundance ratio [Y/Mg] (6.4 Gyr) indicate an age\nof about 6 billion years. The star is enhanced in refractory elements when\ncompared to the Sun, and the refractory enrichment is even stronger after\ncorrections for Galactic chemical evolution. We determined a NLTE Li abundance\nof 1.52 dex, which is four times higher than what would be expected for the age\nof HIP 68468. The older age is also supported by the low log(R'HK) (-5.05) and\nlow jitter. Engulfment of a rocky planet of 6 Earth masses can explain the\nenhancement in both lithium and the refractory elements. [Conclusions]. The\nsuper-Neptune planet candidate is too massive for in situ formation, and\ntherefore its current location is most likely the result of planet migration\nthat could also have driven other planets towards its host star, enhancing thus\nthe abundance of lithium and refractory elements in HIP 68468. The intriguing\nevidence of planet accretion warrants further observations to verify the\nexistence of the planets that are indicated by our data and to better constrain\nthe nature of the planetary system around this unique star. \n\n"}

Models have been proposed that these planets can either\noriginate beyond the snowline and then move inward via disk migration, or form\n\"in-situ\" inside the snowline. The goal of this work is to verify which of\nthese two scenarios is more compatible with pebble accretion, and whether we\ncan distinguish observationally between them via the resulting planetary C/O\nratios and core masses. Our results show that, for solar system composition,\nthe C/O ratios will vary but moderately between the two populations, since a\nsignificant amount of carbon and oxygen are locked up in refractories. In this\ncase, we find a strong correlation between the carbon and oxygen abundances and\ncore mass. The C/O ratio variations are more pronounced in the case where we\nassume that all carbon and oxygen are in volatiles. On average, Hot-Jupiters\nforming \"in-situ\" inside the snowline will have higher C/O ratios because they\naccrete less water ice. However, only Hot-Jupiters forming in-situ around stars\nwith C/O=0.8 can have a C/O ratio higher than unity. We finally find that, even\nwith fast pebble accretion, it is significantly easier to form Hot-Jupiters\noutside of the snowline, even if forming these \"in-situ\" is not impossible in\nthe limit of the simplifying assumptions made. \n\n"}

In this work we explore the effect of\nphotophoresis on the settling of large dust grains in the inner regions of\nactively accreting protoplanetary disks. Photophoretic forces on dust grains\nresult from the collision of gas molecules with differentially heated grains.\nWe undertake one dimensional dust settling calculations to determine the\nequilibrium vertical distribution of dust grains in each column of the disk.

In an attempt to unravel their\nphysical nature, visible spectroscopy of both targets was obtained using the\nOSIRIS camera-spectrograph at the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC).

This paper motivates\nfinding both types of three-body system by calculating analytic and numerical\nprobabilities for all transit configurations, accounting for any mutual\ninclination and orbital precession.

Outline\n  of the magnetospheric rebound model Abstract: The Kepler mission has discovered that multiple close-in super-Earth planets\nare common around solar-type stars, but their period ratios do not show strong\npile-ups near mean motion resonances (MMRs). One scenario is that super-Earths\nform in a gas-rich disk, and they interact gravitationally with the surrounding\ngas, inducing their orbital migration. Disk migration theory predicts, however,\nthat planets would end up at resonant orbits due to their differential\nmigration speed. Motivated by the discrepancy between observation and theory,\nwe seek for a mechanism that moves planets out of resonances. We examine the\norbital evolution of planet pairs near the magnetospheric cavity during the gas\ndisk dispersal phase. Our study determines the conditions under which planets\ncan escape resonances. We perform two-planet N-body simulations, varying the\nplanet masses, stellar magnetic field strengths, disk accretion rates and gas\ndisk depletion timescales. As planets migrate outward with the expanding\nmagnetospheric cavity, their dynamical configurations can be rearranged.\nMigration of planets is substantial (minor) in a massive (light) disk. When the\nouter planet is more massive than the inner planet, the period ratio of two\nplanets increases through outward migration. On the other hand, when the inner\nplanet is more massive, the final period ratio tends to remain similar to the\ninitial one. Larger stellar magnetic field strengths result in planets stopping\ntheir migration at longer periods. We highlight \\textit{magnetospheric rebound}\nas an important ingredient able to reconcile disk migration theory with\nobservations. Even when planets are trapped into MMR during the early gas-rich\nstage, subsequent cavity expansion would induce substantial changes to their\norbits, moving them out of resonance. \n\n"}

Inspired by this result, we study the effect of ISM absorption\non activity measurements (S and logR'$_{\\rm HK}$ indices) for main-sequence\nlate-type stars. To this end, we employ synthetic stellar photospheric spectra\ncombined with varying amounts of chromospheric emission and ISM absorption. We\npresent the effect of ISM absorption on activity measurements by varying\nseveral instrumental, stellar, and ISM parameters. We find that for relative\nvelocities between the stellar and ISM lines smaller than 30-40 km/s and for\nISM CaII column densities logN$_{\\rm CaII}$>12, the ISM absorption has a\nsignificant influence on activity measurements. Direct measurements and three\ndimensional maps of the Galactic ISM absorption indicate that an ISM CaII\ncolumn density of logN$_{\\rm CaII}$=12 is typically reached by a distance of\nabout 100 pc along most sight lines.

The ram pressure exerted\nby the flow can truncate the disc and the accretion of material with no\nazimuthal angular momentum leads to further disc contraction.

We test our model by performing\nhydrodynamical simulations of a protoplanetary disc embedded in a flow with\ndifferent velocities and densities.

The total disc mass in the simulations follows the theoretically expected\ntrend, except at the lowest density where our simulated discs lose mass owing\nto continuous stripping. This stripping may be a numerical rather than a\nphysical effect. Some quantitative differences exist between the model\npredictions and the simulations.

The\nmultiple, long, and variable transits suggest the transiting objects are dust\nclouds, probably produced by a disintegrating asteroid.

In this work\nwe investigate whether the warm dust may be a signature of asteroid belt\nanalogues.

This idea is explored\nwith an analytic collisional evolution model for a sample of 225 debris discs\nfrom a Spitzer/IRS catalogue that are likely to possess a two-component\nstructure.

An evolutionary classification of disks was\nproposed based on their IR spectral energy distribution, with the Group I\nsources showing a prominent cold component ascribed to an earlier stage of\nevolution than Group II.

The stars are surrounded by a\ndebris disk which displays a ring-like morphology and strong asymmetries at\nmultiple scales. We aim at studying the likelihood of a scenario where the\nplanet formed closer to the stars in the disk, underwent inward disk-induced\nmigration, and got scattered away by the binary star before being stabilized by\na close encounter (fly-by). We performed semi-analytical calculations and\nnumerical simulations (Swift_HJS package) to model the interactions between the\nplanet and the two stars. We accounted for the migration as a simple force. We\nstudied the LCC kinematics to set constraints on the local density of stars,\nand therefore on the fly-by likelihood. We performed N-body simulations to\ndetermine the effects of the planet trajectories (ejection and secular effects)\nonto the disk morphology. The combination of the migration and mean-motion\nresonances with the binary star (often 1:6) can eject the planet. Nonetheless,\nwe estimate that the fly-by hypothesis decreases the scenario probability to\nless than $10^{-7}$ for a derived local density of stars of 0.11\nstars/pc$^{3}$.

After the initial\nstage of planet formation is complete, the gravitational interactions between\nplanets can lead to the physical collision of two planets, or the ejection of\none or more planets from the system. When this occurs, the remaining planets\nare typically left in more eccentric orbits.

We\ndeveloped a Bayesian framework that combines data from N-body simulations with\npresent-day observations to compute a probability distribution for the planets\nthat were ejected or collided in the past. Integrating across the exoplanet\npopulation, we obtained an estimate of the initial mass function of exoplanets.\nWe find that the ejected planets are primarily sub-Saturn type planets.

Traditionally, super-stellar elemental abundances in giant\nplanets were thought to be possible due to accretion of metal-rich solids. Such\nenrichments are accompanied by oxygen-rich compositions (i.e. C/O below the\ndisc's value, assumed to be solar, C/O=0.54). Without solid accretion the\nplanets are expected to have sub-solar metallicity, but high C/O ratios. This\narises because the solids are dominated by oxygen-rich species, e.g. H$_2$O and\nCO$_2$, which freeze out in the disk earlier than CO, leaving the gas metal\npoor but carbon-rich. Here we demonstrate that super-solar metallicities can be\nachieved by gas accretion alone when growth and radial drift of pebbles are\nconsidered in protoplanetary discs. Through this mechanism planets may\nsimultaneously acquire super-solar metallicities and super-solar C/O ratios.\nThis happens because the pebbles transport volatile species inward as they\nmigrate through the disc, enriching the gas at snow lines where the volatiles\nsublimate. Furthermore, the planet's composition can be used to constrain where\nit formed. Since high C/H and C/O ratios cannot be created by accreting solids,\nit may be possible to distinguish between formation via pebble accretion and\nplanetesimal accretion by the level of solid enrichment. Finally, we expect\nthat Jupiter's C/O ratio should be near or above solar if its enhanced carbon\nabundance came through accreting metal rich gas. Thus Juno's measurement of\nJupiter's C/O ratio should determine whether Jupiter accreted its metals from\ncarbon rich gas or oxygen rich solids. \n\n"}

Additionally, we examine the potential effects of gravitational\ndarkening (GD), revealing that it could significantly amplify disc-integrated\npolarization. GD imparts a non-linear inverse temperature-dependence to the\nresulting polarization.\n  Photopolarimetric observations are sensitive to oblateness and inclination.\nThe degree-of-polarization (DoP) increases in response to both, making it\npotentially useful for assessing the spatial orientation of the BD. Under our\nmodel assumptions, increasing droplet size in optically thick clouds causes a\nblue-ward shift in near-infrared (NIR) colors of BDs --- interesting in view of\nthe observed J-K brightening in L/T transition. For large cloud grains,\npolarization decreases sharply, while transmitted intensity shows a steady\nincrease. BD polarization is thus a potential indicator not only of the\npresence of clouds but also provides information on cloud grain size. \n\n"}

Abstract: We present coronagraphic long slit spectra of AU Mic's debris disk taken with\nthe STIS instrument aboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Our spectra are\nthe first spatially resolved, scattered light spectra of the system's disk,\nwhich we detect at projected distances between approximately 10 and 45 AU. Our\nspectra cover a wavelength range between 5200 and 10200 angstroms. We find that\nthe color of AU Mic's debris disk is bluest at small (12-35 AU) projected\nseparations. These results both confirm and quantify the findings qualitatively\nnoted by Krist et al.

Unlike previous literature that reported the color of\nAU Mic's disk became increasingly more blue as a function of projected\nseparation beyond approximately 30 AU, we find the disk's optical color between\n35-45 AU to be uniformly blue on the southeast side of the disk and\ndecreasingly blue on the northwest side. We note that this apparent change in\ndisk color at larger projected separations coincides with several fast, outward\nmoving \"features\" that are passing through this region of the southeast side of\nthe disk. We speculate that these phenomenon might be related, and that the\nfast moving features could be changing the localized distribution of sub-micron\nsized grains as they pass by, thereby reducing the blue color of the disk in\nthe process. We encourage follow-up optical spectroscopic observations of the\nAU Mic to both confirm this result, and search for further modifications of the\ndisk color caused by additional fast moving features propagating through the\ndisk. \n\n"}

This problem thus far has largely been addressed only by\nconsidering two objects: the star and the planet itself. However, many systems\nhave been found to harbor multiple planets, with some in or very near to\nmean-motion resonances. The presence of a planetary companion near a\nmean-motion resonance can induce oscillatory variations in the mean-motion of\nthe planet, which we demonstrate can have significant effects on the spin-state\nof an otherwise synchronously rotating planet. In particular, we find that a\nplanetary companion near a mean-motion resonance can excite the spin states of\nplanets in the habitable zone of small, cool stars, pushing otherwise\nsynchronously rotating planets into higher amplitude librations of the spin\nstate, or even complete circulation resulting in effective stellar days with\nfull surface coverage on the order of years or decades. This increase in\nilluminated area can have potentially dramatic influences on climate, and thus\non habitability. We also find that the resultant spin state can be very\nsensitive to initial conditions due to the chaotic nature of the spin state at\nearly times within certain regimes. We apply our model to two hypothetical\nplanetary systems inspired by the K00255 and TRAPPIST-1 systems, which both\nhave Earth-sized planets in mean-motion resonances orbiting cool stars. \n\n"}

As these planets are likely tidal-locked,\nimproved 3D numerical simulations of such planetary atmospheres are needed to\nguide target selection. Here we use a 3-D climate system model, updated with\nnew water-vapor absorption coefficients derived from the HITRAN 2012 database,\nto study ocean covered planets at the inner edge of the HZ around late-M to\nmid-K stars ($2600$ K <= Teff <= 4500K). Our results indicate that these\nupdated water-vapor coefficients result in significant warming compared to\nprevious studies, so the inner HZ around M-dwarfs is not as close as suggested\nby earlier work. Assuming synchronously rotating planets with background 1 bar\nN2 atmospheres, we find that planets at the inner HZ of stars with Teff > 3000K\nundergo the classical \"moist-greenhouse\" (H2O mixing ratio > 10-3 in the\nstratosphere) at significantly lower surface temperature (~ 280K) in our 3-D\nmodel compared with 1-D climate models (~ 340K). This implies that some planets\naround low mass stars can simultaneously undergo water-loss and remain\nhabitable. However, for star with Teff <= 3000K, planets at the inner HZ may\ndirectly transition to a runaway state, while bypassing the moist greenhouse\nwater-loss entirely. We analyze transmission spectra of planets in a moist\ngreen-house regime, and find that there are several prominent H2O features\nwithin JWST instruments range. Thus, relying only upon standard Earth-analog\nspectra with 24-hour rotation period around M-dwarfs for habitability studies\nwill miss the strong H2O features that one would expect to see on synchronously\nrotating planets around M-dwarf stars, with JWST. \n\n"}

The overall results of the survey are\npresented in the form of 850 microns (and 450 microns, where possible) images\nand fluxes for the observed fields. Excess thermal emission, over that expected\nfrom the stellar photosphere, is detected around 49 stars out of the 100\nobserved fields.

The depths of the secondary/tertiary gaps in surface density grow with\ntime in a low viscosity disk ($\\alpha = 5\\times10^{-5}$), so even low-mass\nplanets (e.g., super-Earth or mini-Neptune-mass) embedded in the disk can open\nmultiple observable gaps, provided that sufficient time has passed.

After gas disk dissipation, fully\nformed planets could interact with nearby planetesimals from a remnant\nplanetesimal disk. These interactions would often lead to planetesimal\naccretion due to the relatively high ratio between the planet size and the hill\nradius for typical planets. We present calculations using the open-source\nstellar evolution toolkit MESA (Modules for Experiments in Stellar\nAstrophysics) modified to include the deposition of planetesimals into the H/He\nenvelopes of sub-Neptunes (~1-20 MEarth). We show that planetesimal accretion\ncan alter the mass-radius isochrones for these planets. The same initial planet\nas a result of the same total accreted planetesimal mass can have up to ~5%\ndifference in mean densities several Gyr after the last accretion due to\ninherent stochasticity of the accretion process.

Such observations can be challenging for long period planets, where\nthe transits may last for over a day. Planetary rings will also impact the\nshape of absorption lines in the stellar spectrum, as the planet and rings\ncover different parts of the rotating star (the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect).\nThese line-profile distortions depend on the size, structure, opacity,\nobliquity and sky projected angle of the ring system. For slow rotating stars,\nthis mainly impacts the amplitude of the induced velocity shift, however, for\nfast rotating stars the large velocity gradient across the star allows the line\ndistortion to be resolved, enabling direct determination of the ring\nparameters. We demonstrate that by modeling these distortions we can recover\nring system parameters (sky-projected angle, obliquity and size) using only a\nsmall part of the transit.

One possible formation scenario for HJs is\nhigh-eccentricity (high-e) migration, in which the planet forms at much larger\nradii, is excited to high eccentricity by some mechanism, and migrates to its\ncurrent orbit due to tidal dissipation occurring near periapsis. We consider\nhigh-e migration in dense stellar systems such as the cores of globular\nclusters (GCs), in which encounters with passing stars can excite planets to\nthe high eccentricities needed to initiate migration. We study this process via\nMonte Carlo simulations of encounters with a star+planet system including the\neffects of tidal dissipation, using an efficient regularized restricted\nthree-body code. HJs are produced in our simulations over a significant range\nof the stellar number density n_*. Assuming the planet is initially on a\nlow-eccentricity orbit with semimajor axis 1 au, for n_* < 1e3 pc^{-3} the\nencounter rate is too low to induce orbital migration, whereas for n_* > 1e6\npc^{-3} HJ formation is suppressed because the planet is more likely ejected\nfrom its host star, tidally disrupted, or transferred to a perturbing star. The\nfraction of planets that are converted to HJs peaks at ~ 2% for intermediate\nnumber densities of ~ 4e4 pc^{-3}.

We explore\ndust evolution models in a disk perturbed by two giant planets, as well as\nmodels with a parameterized dust size distribution. The dust evolution model is\nable to reproduce the ring locations and gap widths in polarized intensity, but\nfails to reproduce their depths. It, however, gives a good match with the ALMA\ndust continuum image at 1.3 mm. Models with a parameterized dust size\ndistribution better reproduce the gap depth in scattered light, suggesting that\ndust filtration at the outer edges of the gaps is less effective. The pile-up\nof millimeter grains in a dust trap and the continuous distribution of small\ngrains throughout the gap likely require a more efficient dust fragmentation\nand dust diffusion in the dust trap. Alternatively, turbulence or charging\neffects might lead to a reservoir of small grains at the surface layer that is\nnot affected by the dust growth and fragmentation cycle dominating the dense\ndisk midplane.

By analyzing a time series of stellar spectra from a host\nstar, modern astronomical instruments can in theory detect such planets.\nHowever, in practice, intrinsic stellar variability (e.g., star spots,\nconvective motion, pulsations) affects the spectra and often mimics a radial\nvelocity signal. This signal contamination makes it difficult to reliably\ndetect low-mass planets. A principled approach to recovering planet radial\nvelocity signals in the presence of stellar activity was proposed by Rajpaul et\nal. (2015). It uses a multivariate Gaussian process model to jointly capture\ntime series of the apparent radial velocity and multiple indicators of stellar\nactivity. We build on this work in two ways: (i) we propose using dimension\nreduction techniques to construct new high-information stellar activity\nindicators; and (ii) we extend the Rajpaul et al.

Low signal-to-noise ratio signals need\ntemplated searches with long coherent integration times and thus fine\nparameter-space resolution. Longer integration increases sensitivity. Low-mass\nx-ray binaries (LMXBs) such as Scorpius X-1 (Sco X-1) may emit accretion-driven\nCWs at strains reachable by current ground-based observatories. Binary orbital\nparameters induce phase modulation. This paper describes how resampling\ncorrects binary and detector motion, yielding source-frame time series used for\ncross-correlation. Compared to the previous, detector-frame, templated\ncross-correlation method, used for Sco X-1 on data from the first Advanced LIGO\nobserving run (O1), resampling is about 20x faster in the costliest,\nmost-sensitive frequency bands. Speed-up factors depend on integration time and\nsearch setup. The speed could be reinvested into longer integration with a\nforecast sensitivity gain, 20 to 125 Hz median, of approximately 51%, or from\n20 to 250 Hz, 11%, given the same per-band cost and setup.

I show\nthat objects with M <~ 4 M_Jup orbit metal-rich solar-type dwarf stars, a\nproperty associated with core accretion. Objects with M >~ 10 M_Jup do not\nshare this property. This transition is coincident with a minimum in the\noccurrence rate of such objects, suggesting that the maximum mass of a\ncelestial body formed through core accretion like a planet is less than 10\nM_Jup. Consequently, objects with M >~ 10 M_Jup orbiting solar-type dwarf stars\nlikely formed through gravitational instability and should not be thought of as\nplanets.

The aim of this analysis is to present\nthe differences occurring when dust evolution is included relative to\nsimulations with fixed dust size, with and without an embedded Jupiter-mass\nplanet that triggers gap formation. We use the two-fluid polar Godunov-type\ncode RoSSBi developed by Surville et al. 2016 combined with a new local\nsub-grid method for dust evolution based on the model by Birnstiel et al. 2012.\nWe find striking differences between simulations with variable and fixed dust\nsizes. The timescales for dust depletion differ significantly and yield a\ncompletely different evolution of the dust surface density. In general sharp\nfeatures such as pile-ups of dust in the inner disk and near gap edges, when a\nmassive planet is present, become much weaker. This has important implications\non the interpretation of observed substructure in disks, suggesting that the\npresence of a massive planet does not necessarily cause sharp gaps and rings in\nthe dust component. Also, particles with different dust sizes show a different\ndistribution, pointing to the importance of multi-wavelength synthetic\nobservations in order to compare with observations by ALMA and other\ninstruments. We also find that simulations adopting fixed intermediate particle\nsizes, in the range $10^{-2} - 10^{-1}$ cm, best approximate the surface\ndensity evolution seen in simulations with dust evolution. \n\n"}

Most likely due to instrumental limitations and their natural\nfaintness, little is known about debris disks around low-mass stars, especially\nwhen it comes to spatially resolved observations. We present new VLT/SPHERE\nIRDIS Dual-Polarization Imaging (DPI) observations in which we detect the dust\nring around the M2 spectral type star TWA\\,7. Combined with additional Angular\nDifferential Imaging observations we aim at a fine characterization of the\ndebris disk and setting constraints on the presence of low-mass planets. We\nmodel the SPHERE DPI observations and constrain the location of the small dust\ngrains, as well as the spectral energy distribution of the debris disk, using\nthe results inferred from the observations, and perform simple N-body\nsimulations. We find that the dust density distribution peaks at 25 au, with a\nvery shallow outer power-law slope, and that the disk has an inclination of 13\ndegrees with a position angle of 90 degrees East of North. We also report low\nsignal-to-noise detections of an outer belt at a distance of ~52 au from the\nstar, of a spiral arm in the Southern side of the star, and of a possible dusty\nclump at 3.9 au. These findings seem to persist over timescales of at least a\nyear. Using the intensity images, we do not detect any planets in the close\nvicinity of the star, but the sensitivity reaches Jovian planet mass upper\nlimits. We find that the SED is best reproduced with an inner disk at 7 au and\nanother belt at 25 au. We report the detections of several unexpected features\nin the disk around TWA\\,7. A yet undetected 100 M$_\\oplus$ planet with a\nsemi-major axis at 20-30 au could possibly explain the outer belt as well as\nthe spiral arm.

We simulate SPHERE/IRDIS time series of\nobservations in which we blindly inject planets on random orbits, at random\nlevel of S/N, below the detection limit (down to S/N 1.5). We then use an\noptimization algorithm to guess the orbital parameters, and take into account\nthe orbital motion to properly recombine the different images, and eventually\ndetect the planets. We show that an optimization algorithm can indeed be used\nto find undetected planets in temporal sequences of images, even if they are\nspread over orbital time scales. As expected, the typical gain in S/N ratio is\nsqrt(n), n being the number of observations combined. We find that the\nK-Stacker algorithm is able de-orbit and combine the images to reach a level of\nperformance similar to what could be expected if the planet was not moving.

CLEAN and ANOVA algorithms are used to analyze `Oumuamua's\nlightcurve using 818 observations over 29.3~days.

Though often correlated with a perceived delayed spike in the lunar\ncratering record known as the Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB), recent work\nsuggests that this event may have occurred much earlier; perhaps during the\nepoch of terrestrial planet formation. While current simulations of terrestrial\naccretion can reproduce many observed qualities of the solar system,\nreplicating the small mass of Mars requires modification to standard planet\nformation models. Here we use 800 dynamical simulations to show that an early\ninstability in the outer solar system strongly influences terrestrial planet\nformation and regularly yields properly sized Mars analogs. Our most successful\noutcomes occur when the terrestrial planets evolve an additional 1-10 million\nyears (Myr) following the dispersal of the gas disk, before the onset of the\ngiant planet instability. In these simulations, accretion has begun in the Mars\nregion before the instability, but the dynamical perturbation induced by the\ngiant planets' scattering removes large embryos from Mars' vicinity. Large\nembryos are either ejected or scattered inward toward Earth and Venus (in some\ncases to deliver water), and Mars is left behind as a stranded embryo.

High-contrast exoplanet imaging is a rapidly growing field as can be\nseen through the significant resources invested.

We aim to improve the signal-to-noise ratio\n(SNR) achievable for ground-based, adaptive-optics assisted exoplanet imaging\nby applying sophisticated post-processing algorithms. In particular, we\ninvestigate the benefits of including time domain information. Methods. We\nintroduce a new speckle-suppression technique in data post-processing based on\nwavelet transformation. This technique explicitly considers the time domain in\na given data set (specifically the frequencies of speckle variations and their\ntime dependence) and allows us to filter-out speckle noise. We combine our\nwavelet-based algorithm with state-of-the-art principal component analysis\n(PCA) based PSF subtraction routines and apply it to archival data sets of\nknown directly imaged exoplanets. The data sets were obtained in the L filter\nwhere the short integration times allow for a sufficiently high temporal\nsampling of the speckle variations. Results. We demonstrate that improvements\nin the peak SNR of up to forty to sixty percent can be achieved. We also show\nthat, when combined with wavelet-denoising, the PCA PSF model requires\nsystematically smaller numbers of components for the fit to achieve the highest\nSNR. The improvement potential is, however, data set dependent or, more\nspecifically, closely linked to the field rotation available in a given data\nset: larger amounts of rotation allow for a better suppression of the speckle\nnoise.

{"id": "1804.05065", "contents": "Title: Ultra-short-period planets from secular chaos Abstract: Over a hundred rocky planets orbiting Sun-like stars in very short orbital\nperiods (<1 day) have been discovered by the Kepler mission. These planets,\nknown as ultra-short-period (USP) planets, are unlikely to have attained their\norbits in situ. Instead, they must have migrated in. Here we propose that these\nplanets reach their current orbits by high-eccentricity migration. In a\nscaled-down version of the dynamics that may have been experienced by their\nhigh mass analog, the hot Jupiters, these planets reach high eccentricities via\nchaotic secular interactions with their companion planets and then undergo\norbital circularization due to dissipation of tides raised on the planet. This\nproposal is motivated by the following observations: planetary systems observed\nby Kepler often contain several super-Earths with non-negligible eccentricities\nand inclinations, and possibly extending beyond AU distances; while only a\nsmall fraction of USP planets have known transiting companions, and none\nclosely spaced, we argue that most of them should have companions at periods of\n~10-50 days. The outer sibling planets, through secular chaos, can remove\nangular momentum from the inner most planet, originally at periods of ~5-10\ndays. When the latter reaches an eccentricity higher than 0.8, it is tidally\ncaptured by the central star and becomes an USP planet. This scenario naturally\nexplains the observation that most USP planets have significantly more distant\ntransiting companions compared to their counterparts at slightly longer periods\n(1-3 days), a feature un-accounted for in other proposed scenarios. Our model\nalso predicts that USP planets should have: (i) spin-orbit angles, and\ninclinations relative to outer planets, in the range of ~10-50 degrees; (ii)\nseveral outer planetary companions extending to beyond AU distances, both of\nwhich may be tested by TESS and its follow-up observations. \n\n"}

The cloud properties on the east and west limbs show\ndistinct differences that increase with increasing equilibrium temperature.\nCloud opacities are roughly constant across a broad wavelength range with the\nexception of features in the mid-infrared. Forward scattering is found to be\nimportant across the same wavelength range. Using the fully resolved size\ndistribution of cloud particles as opposed to a mean particle size has a\ndistinct impact on the resultant cloud opacities. The particle size that\ncontributes the most to the cloud opacity depends strongly on the cloud\nparticle size distribution. We predict that it is unlikely that silicate or\ntitanium clouds are responsible for the optical Rayleigh scattering slope seen\nin many hot Jupiters. We suggest that cloud opacities in emission may serve as\nsensitive tracers of the thermal state of a planet's deep interior through the\nexistence or lack of a cold trap in the deep atmosphere. \n\n"}

We combine observations and\nchemical models to constrain the sulfur abundances and their sensitivity to\nphysical and chemical conditions in the DM Tau protoplanetary disk. Methods. We\nobtained $0.5^{\"}$ ALMA observations of DM Tau in Bands 4 and 6 in lines of CS,\nSO, SO$_2$, OCS, CCS, H$_2$CS and H$_2$S, achieving a $\\sim 5$ mJy sensitivity.\nUsing the non-LTE radiative transfer code RADEX and the forward-modeling tool\nDiskFit, disk-averaged CS column densities and upper limits for the other\nspecies were derived.

The lack of detections of a variety\nof sulfur-bearing molecules in DM Tau other than CS implies a dearth of\nreactive sulfur in the gas phase, either through efficient freeze-out or\nbecause most of the elemental sulfur is in other large species, as found in\ncomets.

The stronger depletion of oxygen-bearing S-species compared to\nCS is likely linked to the low observed abundances of gaseous water in DM Tau\nand points to a removal mechanism of oxygen from the gas. \n\n"}

In\nprinciple this can be inferred from theoretical mass-luminosity models;\nhowever, these relations have not yet been thoroughly calibrated, since there\nis a lack of substellar companions for which both the brightness and mass have\nbeen directly measured. One notable exception is GJ 758 B, a brown dwarf\ncompanion in a $\\sim$20 AU orbit around a nearby Sun-like star, which has been\nboth directly imaged and dynamically detected through a radial velocity trend\nin the primary. This has enabled a mass constraint for GJ 758 B of\n42$^{+19}_{-7}$ $M_{\\rm Jup}$. Here, we note that Gaia is ideally suited for\nfurther constraining the mass of intermediate-separation companions such as GJ\n758 B. A study of the differential proper motion, $\\Delta \\mu$, with regards to\nHIPPARCOS is particularly useful in this context, as it provides a long time\nbaseline for orbital curvature to occur. By exploiting already determined\norbital parameters, we show that the dynamical mass can be further constrained\nto $42.4^{+5.6}_{-5.0}\\, M_{\\rm Jup}$ through the Gaia-HIPPARCOS $\\Delta \\mu$\nmotion. We compare the new dynamical mass estimate with substellar evolutionary\nmodels and confirm previous indications that there is significant tension\nbetween the isochronal ages of the star and companion, with a preferred stellar\nage of $\\leq 5$ Gyr while the companion is only consistent with very old ages\nof $\\geq 8$ Gyr. \n\n"}

We compute steady-state solutions, and\nshow that the radial motion of both the gas and the dust can deviate\nsubstantially from those for a single-size dust population. Although the\naerodynamic drag from the dust on the gas is weaker than in the case where all\ngrains are optimally coupled to the gas, the cumulative \"back-reaction\" of the\ndust particles can still alter the gas dynamics significantly. In typical\nprotoplanetary discs, the net effect of the dust back-reaction decreases the\ngas accretion flow compared to the dust-free (viscous) case, even for\ndust-to-gas ratios of order $1\\%$. In the outer disc, where dust grains are\ntypically less strongly coupled to the gas and settle towards the midplane, the\ndust back-reaction can even drive outward gas flow. Moreover, the radial inward\ndrift of large grains is reduced below the gas motion in the inner disc\nregions, while small dust grains follow the gas dynamics over all the disc\nextent. The resulting dust and gas dynamics can give rise to observable\nstructures, such as gas and dust cavities.

The resulting planetary distribution is\ncompared with the observed population of extrasolar planets, and the model\nparameters are improved iteratively using a particle swarm optimization scheme.\nThe characteristics of the final planetary systems are mainly controlled by the\npebble isolation mass, which is the mass of a planet that perturbs nearby gas\nenough to halt the inward flux of drifting pebbles and stop growth. The pebble\nisolation mass increases with orbital distance so that giant planet cores can\nonly form in the outer disk. Giants migrate inwards, populating a wide range of\nfinal orbital distances.

We present three-dimensional\nnumerical simulations of the tidal interaction between a protoplanetary disc\nand a misaligned planet. For low planet masses we show that our simulations\naccurately model the evolution of inclined planet orbit (up to moderate\ninclinations). For a planet massive enough to carve a gap, the disc is\nseparated into two components and the gas interior and exterior to the planet\norbit evolve separately, forming an inner and outer disc. Due to the\ninclination of the planet, a warp develops across the planet orbit such that\nthere is a relative tilt and twist between these discs. We show that when other\nparameters are held constant, the relative inclination that develops between\nthe inner and outer disc depends on the outer radius of the total disc\nmodelled.

We run nearly 10^4 simulations over 14 Gyr for F-star, A-star and\nB-star planet hosts, incorporating main sequence stellar masses of 1.5, 2.0,\n2.5, 3.0 and 5.0 solar masses, and initial planetary semimajor axis ratios that\nstraddle their three-dimensional Hill stability limits. We find that the\nnear-coplanar assumption can approximate well the stability frequencies and\ncritical separations found for higher inclinations, except around strong\nmean-motion commensurabilities. Late instabilities -- after the star has become\na white dwarf -- occur throughout the explored mutual inclination range.\nConsequently, non-Kozai mutual inclination should not be used as a predictive\norbital proxy for determining which white dwarf multi-planet systems discovered\nby Gaia should represent high-priority follow-up targets for the detection of\nmetal pollution and planetary debris discs. \n\n"}

By reanalyzing a gravitational waveform\nobtained in a three-dimensional general-relativistic CCSN simulation, we show\nthat both the spectrogram with an adequate window and the quadratic TFA\nseparate the multimodal GW signatures much more clearly compared with the\nprevious analysis. We find that the observed low-frequency excess during the\nSASI active phase is divided into two components, a stronger one at 130 Hz and\nan overtone at 260 Hz, both of which evolve quasi-statically during the\nsimulation time.

In dense magnetized molecular clouds where C-shocks are\npresent, PAHs and nanoparticles are widely believed to originate from grain\nshattering due to grain-grain collisions. The remaining question is whether\nthese nanoparticles can survive in the dense and hot shocked regions, and how\nto constrain their size and abundance with observations. In this paper, we\npresent a new mechanism to destroy nanoparticles in C-shocks based on\ncentrifugal stress within rapidly spinning nanoparticles spun-up by stochastic\natomic bombardment, which is termed rotational disruption. We find that, due to\nsupersonic neutral gas-charged grain drift in C-shocks, nanoparticles can be\nspun-up to suprathermal rotation by stochastic torques exerted by supersonic\nneutral flow.

{"id": "1811.00523", "contents": "Title: How planetary growth outperforms migration Abstract: Planetary migration is a major challenge for planet formation theories. The\nspeed of Type I migration is proportional to the mass of a protoplanet, while\nthe final decade of growth of a pebble-accreting planetary core takes place at\na rate that scales with the mass to the two-thirds power. This results in\nplanetary growth tracks (i.e., the evolution of a protoplanet's mass versus its\ndistance from the star) that become increasingly horizontal\n(migration-dominated) with rising mass of the protoplanet. It has been shown\nrecently that the migration torque on a protoplanet is reduced proportional to\nthe relative height of the gas gap carved by the growing planet. Here we show\nfrom 1-D simulations of planet-disc interaction that the mass at which a planet\ncarves a 50% gap is approximately 2.3 times the pebble isolation mass. Our\nmeasurements of the pebble isolation mass from 1-D simulations match published\n3-D results relatively well, except at very low viscosities where the 3-D\npebble isolation mass is significantly higher, possibly due to gap edge\ninstabilities not captured in 1-D. The pebble isolation mass demarks the\ntransition from pebble accretion to gas accretion. Gas accretion to form\ngas-giant planets therefore takes place over a few astronomical units of\nmigration after reaching first the pebble isolation mass and, shortly after,\nthe 50% gap mass. Our results demonstrate how planetary growth can outperform\nmigration, both during core accretion and during gas accretion, even when the\nStokes number of the pebbles is small, St~0.01, and the pebble-to-gas flux\nratio in the protoplanetary disc is in the nominal range of 0.01-0.02.

We quantify the influence of this\ncharacteristic of the stellar fluxes on the mass loss of close-in planets by\nsimulating the atmospheres of planets orbiting EUV-bright (WASP-33) and\nEUV-faint (KELT-9) A-type stars. For KELT-9b, we find that atmospheric\nexpansion caused by heating due to absorption of the stellar UV and optical\nlight drives mass-loss rates of $\\approx$10$^{11}$ g s$^{-1}$, while heating\ncaused by absorption of the stellar XUV radiation leads to mass-loss rates of\n$\\approx$10$^{10}$ g s$^{-1}$, thus underestimating mass loss.

In\naddition to the equilibrium tidal friction, we incorporate dissipation due to\ndynamical tides that are excited inside the giant planet. Using the method of\nGaussian rings to account for planet-planet interactions, we explore the\nconditions for extreme eccentricity excitation via secular chaos and the\nproperties of hot Jupiters formed in this migration channel. Our calculations\nshow that once the inner planet reaches a sufficiently large eccentricity,\ndynamical tides quickly dissipate the orbital energy, producing an eccentric\nwarm Jupiter, which then decays in semi-major axis through equilibrium tides to\nbecome a hot Jupiter. Dynamical tides help the planet avoid tidal disruption,\nincreasing the chance of forming a hot Jupiter, although not all planets\nsurvive the process. We find that the final orbital periods generally lie in\nthe range of 2-3 days, somewhat shorter than those of the observed hot Jupiter\npopulation.

This resulted in the first detection of rotational emission\nfrom H^13CN in this comet. Using a detailed coma radiative transfer model\naccounting for optical depth and non-LTE excitation effects, we obtained an\nH^12CN/H^13CN ratio of 88+-18, which matches the terrestrial value of 89,\nconsistent with a lack of isotopic fractionation in HCN during comet formation\nin the protosolar accretion disk. The possibility of future discoveries in\nextended sources using autocorrelation spectroscopy from the main ALMA array is\nthus demonstrated. \n\n"}

The\ncomplex astrophysics involved in core-collapse supernovae pose a significant\nchallenge to modeling such phenomena. The Supernova Model Evidence Extractor\n(SMEE) attempts to capture the main features of gravitational wave signals from\ncore-collapse supernovae by using numerical relativity waveforms to create\napproximate models. These models can then be used to perform Bayesian model\nselection to determine if the targeted astrophysical feature is present in the\ngravitational wave signal. In this paper, we extend SMEE's model selection\ncapabilities to include features in the gravitational wave signal that are\nassociated with g-modes and the standing accretion shock instability. For the\nfirst time, we test SMEE's performance using simulated data for planned future\ndetectors, such as the Einstein Telescope, Cosmic Explorer, and LIGO Voyager.\nFurther to this, we show how the performance of SMEE is improved by creating\nmodels from the spectrograms of supernova waveforms instead of their timeseries\nwaveforms that contain stochastic features. In third generation detector\nconfigurations, we find that about 50% of neutrino-driven simulations were\ndetectable at 100 kpc, and 10% at 275 kpc. The explosion mechanism was\ncorrectly determined for all detected signals. \n\n"}

PRISM uses the Bayes linear approach and history matching to construct\nan approximation ('emulator') of any given model, by combining limited model\nevaluations with advanced regression techniques, covariances and probability\ncalculations. It is designed to easily facilitate and enhance existing Markov\nchain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods by restricting plausible regions and exploring\nparameter space efficiently. However, PRISM can additionally be used as a\nstandalone alternative to MCMC for model analysis, providing insight into the\nbehavior of complex scientific models. With PRISM, the time spent on evaluating\na model is minimized, providing developers with an advanced model analysis for\na fraction of the time required by more traditional methods.\n  This paper provides an overview of the different techniques and algorithms\nthat are used within PRISM. We demonstrate the advantage of using the Bayes\nlinear approach over a full Bayesian analysis when analyzing complex models.\nOur results show how much information can be captured by PRISM and how one can\ncombine it with MCMC methods to significantly speed up calibration processes\n(>15 times faster).

{"id": "1901.08777", "contents": "Title: Sectoral r modes and periodic RV variations of Sun-like stars Abstract: Radial velocity (RV) measurements are used to search for planets orbiting\nlate-type main-sequence stars and confirm the transiting planets. The most\nadvanced spectrometers are approaching a precision of $\\sim 10$ cm/s that\nimplies the need to identify and correct for all possible sources of RV\noscillations intrinsic to the star down to this level and possibly beyond. The\nrecent discovery of global-scale equatorial Rossby waves in the Sun, also\ncalled r modes, prompted us to investigate their possible signature in stellar\nRV measurements. R modes are toroidal modes of oscillation whose restoring\nforce is the Coriolis force and propagate in the retrograde direction in a\nframe that corotates with the star. The solar r modes with azimuthal orders $3\n\\leq m \\lesssim 15$ were identified unambiguously because of their dispersion\nrelation and their long e-folding lifetimes of hundreds of days. Here we\nsimulate the RV oscillations produced by sectoral r modes with $2 \\leq m \\leq\n5$ assuming a stellar rotation period of 25.54 days and a maximum amplitude of\nthe surface velocity of each mode of 2 m/s. This amplitude is representative of\nthe solar measurements, except for the $m=2$ mode which has not yet been\nobserved. Sectoral r modes with azimuthal orders $m=2$ and $3$ would produce RV\noscillations with amplitudes of 76.4 and 19.6 cm/s and periods of 19.16 and\n10.22 days, respectively, for a star with an inclination of the rotation axis\n$i=60^{\\circ}$. Therefore, they may produce rather sharp peaks in the Fourier\nspectrum of the radial velocity time series that could lead to spurious\nplanetary detections. Sectoral r~modes may represent a source of confusion in\nthe case of slowly rotating inactive stars that are preferential targets for RV\nplanet search. The main limitation of the present investigation is the lack of\nobservational constraint on the amplitude of the $m=2$ mode on the Sun. \n\n"}
