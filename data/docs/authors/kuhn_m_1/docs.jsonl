In this paper, we develop a\ntheory and algorithm to calculate, analytically and numerically, the spectrum\nof energy density in gravitational waves produced from an inhomogeneous\nbackground of stochastic scalar fields in an expanding universe.

We contrast our method with other numerical methods in the\nliterature, and then we apply it to preheating after chaotic inflation.

We discuss how the gravity wave spectrum\nbuilds up with time and find that the amplitude and the frequency of its peak\ndepend in a relatively simple way on the characteristic spatial scale amplified\nduring preheating.

This lensing anisotropy is\ndistinctive, making it possible to separately measure the galaxy-galaxy,\ngalaxy-magnification {\\it and} magnification-magnification correlations. Here\nwe extend the discussion to the power spectrum and also to redshift space. In\nreal space, pairs oriented close to the LOS direction are not protected against\nnonlinearity even if the pair separation is large; this is because nonlinear\nfluctuations can enter through gravitational lensing at a small transverse\nseparation (or i.e. impact parameter). The situation in Fourier space is\ndifferent: by focusing on a small wavenumber $k$, as is usually done, linearity\nis guaranteed because both the LOS and transverse wavenumbers must be small.\nThis is why magnification distortion of the galaxy correlation appears less\nsevere in Fourier space. Nonetheless, the effect is non-negligible, especially\nfor the transverse Fourier modes, and should be taken into account in\ninterpreting precision measurements of the galaxy power spectrum, for instance\nthose that focus on the baryon oscillations. The lensing induced anisotropy of\nthe power spectrum has a shape that is distinct from the more well known\nredshift space anisotropies due to peculiar motions and the Alcock-Paczynski\neffect. The lensing anisotropy is highly localized in Fourier space while\nredshift space distortions are more spread out. This means that one could\nseparate the magnification bias component in real observations, implying that\npotentially it is possible to perform a gravitational lensing measurement\nwithout measuring galaxy shapes. \n\n"}

Finally, full-sized terrestrial planets accrete\nfrom protoplanets and planetesimals. This final stage of accretion lasts about\n10-100 Myr and is strongly affected by gravitational perturbations from any gas\ngiant planets, which are constrained to form more quickly, during the 1-10 Myr\nlifetime of the gaseous component of the disk. It is during this final stage\nthat the bulk compositions and volatile (e.g., water) contents of terrestrial\nplanets are set, depending on their feeding zones and the amount of radial\nmixing that occurs.

One method employs a direct fit to a modified\nblackbody SED; the other involves a comparison of flux ratios to an analytical\nprediction. Fitting fluxes near the SED peak produces inaccurate temperature\nand dust spectral index estimates due to the line of sight temperature (and\ndensity) variations. Longer wavelength fluxes in the Rayleigh-Jeans part of the\nspectrum (>~ 600 micron for typical cores) may more accurately recover the\nspectral index, but both methods are very sensitive to noise. The temperature\nestimate approaches the density weighted temperature, or \"column temperature,\"\nof the source as short wavelength fluxes are excluded.

Using a Monte Carlo approach, we select the\nphysical parameters of the binary lens system, a star hosting a planet, and we\ncalculate the pixel-lensing light curve taking into account the finite source\neffects. Indeed, their inclusion is crucial since the sources in M31\nmicrolensing events are mainly giant stars. Light curves with detectable\nplanetary features are selected by looking for significant deviations from the\ncorresponding Paczy\\'{n}ski shapes. We find that the time scale of planetary\ndeviations in light curves increase (up to 3-4 days) as the source size\nincreases. This means that only few exposures per day, depending also on the\nrequired accuracy, may be sufficient to reveal in the light curve a planetary\ncompanion. Although the mean planet mass for the selected events is about $2\nM_{\\rm {Jupiter}}$, even small mass planets ($M_{\\rm P} < 20 M_{\\oplus}$) can\ncause significant deviations, at least in the observations with large\ntelescopes. However, even in the former case, the probability to find\ndetectable planetary features in pixel-lensing light curves is at most a few\npercent of the detectable events, and therefore many events have to be\ncollected in order to detect an extrasolar planet in M31.

We find that all\nseven compact galaxies require a two-component fit to their light profile and\nhave measured velocity dispersions that exceed those expected for typical\nearly-type galaxies at their luminosity.

If this is interpreted as an age\nspread, the multiple populations are separated by a few hundred Myr, which\nwould call into question the long held notion that clusters are simple stellar\npopulations. Here we show that stellar rotation in stars with masses between\n1.2-1.7 Msun can mimic the effect of a double or multiple population, whereas\nin actuality only a single population exists. The two main causes of the spread\nnear the turn-off are the effects of stellar rotation on the structure of the\nstar and the inclination angle of the star relative to the observer. Both\neffects change the observed effective temperature, hence colour, and flux of\nthe star. In order to match observations, the required rotation rates are\n20-50% of the critical rotation, which are consistent with observed rotation\nrates of similar mass stars in the Galaxy. We provide scaling relations which\ncan be applied to non-rotating isochrones in order to mimic the effects of\nrotation. Finally, we note that rotation is unlikely to be the cause of the\nmultiple stellar populations observed in old globular clusters, as low mass\nstars (<1 Msun) are not expected to be rapid rotators. \n\n"}

The vortices (and thus magnetic\nflux) would be expelled from the star during stellar spin-down, leading to\nmagnetic reconnection at the surface of the star and the prolific production of\nthermal energy. In this paper, we show that this energy release can re-heat\nquark stars to exceptionally high temperatures, such as observed for Soft Gamma\nRepeaters (SGRs), Anomalous X-Ray pulsars (AXPs), and X-ray dim isolated\nneutron stars (XDINs).

Planet\nformation itself as well as photoevaporation by energetic radiation from the\ncentral young stellar object have been proposed as plausible dispersal\nmechanisms. [abridged]. In this paper we use the different metallicity\ndependance of X-ray photoevaporation and planet formation to discriminate\nbetween these two processes. We study the effects of metallicity, Z, on the\ndispersal timescale, t_phot, in the context of a photoevaporation model, by\nmeans of detailed thermal calculations of a disc in hydrostatic equilibrium\nirradiated by EUV and X-ray radiation from the central source. Our models show\nt_phot \\propto Z^0.52 for a pure photoevaporation model. By means of analytical\nestimates we derive instead a much stronger negative power dependance on\nmetallicity of the disc lifetime for a dispersal model based on planet\nformation. A census of disc fractions in lower metallicity regions should\ntherefore be able to distinguish between the two models. A recent study by\nYasui et al. in low metallicity clusters of the extreme outer Galaxy ([O/H] ~-\n0.7dex and dust to gas ratio of ~0.001) provides preliminary observational\nevidence for shorter disc lifetimes at lower metallicities, in agreement with\nthe predictions of a pure photoevaporation model.

Analysis of the radii of curvature of electron trajectories in the\ninertial observer's frame (IOF) enables these two effects to be considered\ntogether. We demonstrate that for dipolar magnetic field lines on the TS there\nexists a `caustic phase' beyond which no emission can be observed.

The maximum gradient of polarisation angle\n(PA) in the S-shaped PA curve is also associated with the curvature minimum and\noccurs at exactly the same phase. The asymmetry of trajectory curvature with\nrespect to the dipole axis affects the curvature emissivity and the efficiency\nof pair production, suggesting a minimum at the caustic phase.

The\nlopsided stellar disk exerts a strong torque on the remaining gas, driving\ninflows that fuel the growth of the BH and produce quasar-level luminosities.\nThe same disk can produce significant obscuration along many sightlines and\nthus may be the putative 'torus' invoked to explain obscured active galactic\nnuclei and the cosmic X-ray background.

Aims: We obtain precise chromospheric activity\nmeasurements and projected rotational velocities for nearby (d < 25 pc) cool\n(spectral types F to K) stars, to estimate their expected activity-related\njitter. As a complementary objective, we attempt to obtain relationships\nbetween fluxes in different activity indicator lines, that permit a\ntransformation of traditional activity indicators, i.e, CaII H & K lines, to\nothers that hold noteworthy advantages. Methods: We used high resolution\n(~50000) echelle optical spectra. To determine the chromospheric emission of\nthe stars in the sample, we used the spectral subtraction technique. Rotational\nvelocities were determined using the cross-correlation technique. To infer\nactivity-related radial velocity (RV) jitter, we used empirical relationships\nbetween this jitter and the R'_HK index. Results: We measured chromospheric\nactivity, as given by different indicators throughout the optical spectra, and\nprojected rotational velocities for 371 nearby cool stars. We have built\nempirical relationships among the most important chromospheric emission lines.\nFinally, we used the measured chromospheric activity to estimate the expected\nRV jitter for the active stars in the sample. \n\n"}

First, we model\nthe observations with a dusty wind-blown bubble, and then ask whether dust\ncould survive within N49 to its present age (estimated to be 5x10^5 to 10^6\nyears). We find that dust sputtering and especially dust-gas friction would\nimply relatively short timescales (t ~ 10^4 years) for dust survival in the\nwind-shocked region of the bubble. To explain the 24 micron emission, we\npostulate that the grains are replenished within the wind-blown bubble by\ndestruction of embedded, dense cloudlets of ISM gas that have been over-run by\nthe expanding wind-blown bubble. We calculate the ablation timescales for\ncloudlets within N49 and find approximate parameters for the embedded cloudlets\nthat can replenish the dust; the parameters for the cloudlets are roughly\nsimilar to those observed in other nebula. Such dust will have an important\neffect on the bubble: including simple dust cooling in a wind-blown bubble\nmodel for N49, we find that the luminosity is higher by approximately a factor\nof six at a bubble age of about 10^4 years. At ages of 10^7 years, the energy\ncontained in the bubble is lower by about a factor of eight if dust is\nincluded; if dust must be replenished within the bubble, the associated\naccompanying gas mass will also be very important to wind-blown bubble cooling\nand evolution.

We argue that previous\nattempts to form disc galaxies have been unsuccessful because of the universal\nadoption of strong feedback combined with high star formation efficiencies.\nUnless extreme amounts of energy are injected into the interstellar medium\nduring supernovae events, these star formation parameters result in bulge\ndominated S0/Sa galaxies as star formation is too efficient at z~3.

We suggest that the resulting\nearly ingress is caused by a bow shock ahead of the planetary orbital motion.\nIn this Letter we investigate the conditions that might lead to the formation\nof such a bow shock. We consider two scenarios: (1) the stellar magnetic field\nis strong enough to confine the hot coronal plasma out to the planetary orbit\nand (2) the stellar magnetic field is unable to confine the plasma, which\nescapes in a wind. In both cases, a shock capable of compressing plasma to the\nobserved densities will form around the planet for plasma temperatures T < (4 -\n5) x 10^6 K. In the confined case, the shock always forms directly ahead of the\nplanet, but in the wind case the shock orientation depends on the wind speed\nand hence on the plasma temperature. For higher wind temperatures, the shock\nforms closer to the line of centers between the planet and the star. We\nconclude that shock formation leading to an observable early UV ingress is\nlikely to be a common feature of transiting systems and may prove to be a\nuseful tool in setting limits on planetary magnetic field strengths Bp.

Since a racemic mixture of chiral\nnucleotides frustrates the extension and replication of RNA and DNA,\nunderstanding the origin of homochirality has important implications to the\ninvestigation of the origin of life. Here we suggest a novel solution to the\nhomochirality problem based on a recently proposed thermodynamic dissipation\ntheory for the origin of life. Homochirality is suggested to have been\nincorporated gradually into the emerging life as a result of asymmetric right-\nover left-handed photon-induced denaturation of RNA/DNA occurring when Archean\nsea surface temperatures became close to the denaturing temperatures of\nRNA/DNA. This differential denaturing success would have been promoted by the\nsomewhat right-handed circularly polarized submarine light of the late\nafternoon when surface water temperatures are highest, and a negative circular\ndichroism band extending from 220 nm up to 260 nm for small segments of\nRNA/DNA. A numerical model is presented demonstrating the efficacy of such a\nmechanism in procuring 100% homochirality of RNA or DNA from an original\nracemic solution in less than 500 Archean years assuming a photon absorption\nthreshold for replication representing the hydrogen bonding energies between\ncomplimentary strands. Because cholesteric D-nucleic acids have greater\naffinity for L-amino acids due to a positive structural complementarity, and\nbecause D-RNA/DNA+L-amino acid complexes also have a negative circular\ndichroism band between 200 - 300 nm, the homochirality of amino acids can also\nbe explained by the theory. \n\n"}

As such, in recent years the idea of a formation of\nsunspots near the top of the convection zone has generated some interest. The\npresence of turbulence can strongly enhance diffusive transport mechanisms,\nleading to an effective transport coefficient formalism in the mean-field\nformulation.

Testing and calibrating against observations is essential for\ntheir reliability. For this purpose one preferably uses observed stars that\nhave never experienced strong binary interaction, i.e. \"true single stars\".\nHowever, the binary fraction among massive stars is high and identifying \"true\nsingle stars\" is not straight forward. Binary interaction affects systems in\nsuch a way that the initially less massive star becomes, or appears to be,\nsingle. For example, mass transfer results in a widening of the orbit and a\ndecrease of the luminosity of the donor star, which makes it very hard to\ndetect. After a merger or disruption of the system by the supernova explosion,\nno companion will be present.\n  The only unambiguous identification of \"true single stars\" is possible in\ndetached binaries, which contain two main-sequence stars. For these systems we\ncan exclude the occurrence of mass transfer since their birth. A further\nadvantage is that binaries can often provide us with direct measurements of the\nfundamental stellar parameters. Therefore, we argue these binaries are worth\nthe effort needed to observe and analyze them. They may provide the most\nstringent test cases for single stellar models. \n\n"}

We detect 225 X-ray sources, of which 85% are confidently identified\nas young stellar members of the region. Two potential distances of the cluster,\n260 pc and 600 pc, are used in the paper.

Here we present the results from the\nfirst radiation-magnetohydrodynamical (RMHD) simulation including ionization\nfeedback, comparing an RMHD model of a 1000 M_sol rotating cloud to earlier\nradiation gas dynamical models with the same initial density and velocity\ndistributions. We find that despite starting with a strongly supercritical mass\nto flux ratio, the magnetic field has three effects. First, the field offers\nlocally support against gravitational collapse in the accretion flow,\nsubstantially reducing the amount of secondary fragmentation in comparison to\nthe gas dynamical case. Second, the field drains angular momentum from the\ncollapsing gas, further increasing the amount of material available for\naccretion by the central, massive, protostar, and thus increasing its final\nmass by about 50% from the purely gas dynamical case. Third, the field is wound\nup by the rotation of the flow, driving a tower flow. However, this flow never\nachieves the strength seen in low-mass star formation simulations for two\nreasons: gravitational fragmentation disrupts the circular flow in the central\nregions where the protostars form, and the expanding H II regions tend to\nfurther disrupt the field geometry. Therefore, outflows driven by ionization\nheating look likely to be more dynamically important in regions of massive star\nformation. \n\n"}

We trace its\ninfluence from interstellar cloud scales down to star-disk scales.

Large scale nonlinear\nflows can create compressed cloud layers within which ambipolar diffusion\noccurs rapidly. However, in the flux-freezing limit that may be applicable to\nphotoionized molecular cloud envelopes, supersonic motions can persist for long\ntimes if driven by an externally generated magnetic field that corresponds to a\nsubcritical mass-to-flux ratio. In the case of protostellar accretion, rapid\nmagnetic diffusion (through Ohmic dissipation with additional support from\nambipolar diffusion) near the protostar causes dramatic magnetic flux loss. By\ndoing so, it also allows the formation of a centrifugal disk, thereby avoiding\nthe magnetic braking catastrophe. \n\n"}

We\nobserved 112 un-evolved stars at the Turnoff of the NGC6752 cluster with FLAMES\nat the VLT to investigate the presence and the extent of a Li-O correlation.\nThis correlation is expected if there is a simple pollution scenario. Li (670.8\nnm) and O triplet (771 nm) abundances are derived in NLTE. All stars belong to\na very narrow region of the color-magnitude diagram, so they have similar\nstellar parameters (Teff, log g). We find that O and Li correlate, with a high\nstatistical significance that confirms the early results for this cluster. At\nfirst glance this is what is expected if a simple pollution of pristine gas\nwith CNO cycled gas (O-poor, Li-poor) occurred. The slope of the relationship,\nhowever, is about 0.4, and differs from unity by over 7 Sigma. A slope of one\nis the value predicted for a pure contamination model.

This causes a series of\nhydrodynamical interactions in the surrounding medium. Whenever a fast wind\nfollows a slow wind phase, the fast wind sweeps up the slow wind in a shell,\nwhich can be observed as a circumstellar nebula.\n  One of the most striking examples of such an interaction is when a massive\nstar changes from a red supergiant into a Wolf-Rayet star. Nebulae resulting\nfrom such a transition have been observed around many Wolf-Rayet stars and show\ndetailed, complicated structures owing to local instabilities in the swept-up\nshells.\n  Shells also form in the case of massive binary stars, where the winds of two\nstars collide with one another. Along the collision front gas piles up, forming\na shell that rotates along with the orbital motion of the binary stars. In this\ncase the shell follows the surface along which the ram pressure of the two\ncolliding winds is in balance.\n  Using the MPI-AMRVAC hydrodynamics code we have made multi-dimensional\nsimulations of these interactions in order to model the formation and evolution\nof these circumstellar nebulae and explore whether full 3D simulations are\nnecessary to obtain accurate models of such nebulae. \n\n"}

Given the uncertainties inherent to age-dating young\nstars, we propose an alternative approach that is to analyse the spatial\ndistribution of disc-bearing low-mass stars and compare it to that of\ndisc-bearing solar-type stars in the same cluster. A significant age difference\nbetween the two populations should be reflected in their average nearest\nneighbour distance (normalised to the number of sources), where the older\npopulation should appear more spread out.\n  To this aim, we perform a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) analysis on the spatial\ndistribution of disc-bearing young stellar objects (YSOs) in six nearby low\nmass star forming regions.

The MBH feedback heats the surrounding ISM up to 1e6 K through\nphotoionization and Compton heating and locally suppresses star formation in\nthe galactic inner core. The feedback considerably changes the stellar\ndistribution there. This new channel of feedback from a slowly growing MBH is\nparticularly interesting because it is only locally dominant, and does not\nrequire the heating of gas globally on the disk.

Orbits with arbitrary inclination to the stellar\nrotation axis are considered. We obtain results both from an analytic treatment\nand numerical one that are in satisfactory agreement. These results are applied\nto the initial phase of the tidal circularisation problem. We find that both\ntides induced in the star and planet can lead to a significant decrease of the\norbital semi-major axis for orbits having periastron distances smaller than 5-6\nstellar radii (corresponding to periods $\\sim 4-5$ days after the\ncircularisation has been completed) with tides in the star being much stronger\nfor retrograde orbits compared to prograde orbits. We use the simple Skumanich\nlaw for the stellar rotation with its rotational period equal to one month at\nthe age of 5Gyr. The strength of tidal interactions is characterised by\ncircularisation time scale, $t_{ev}$ defined as a time scale of evolution of\nthe planet's semi-major axis due to tides considered as a function of orbital\nperiod $P_{obs}$ after the process of tidal circularisation has been completed.\nWe find that the ratio of the initial circularisation time scales corresponding\nto prograde and retrograde orbits is of order 1.5-2 for a planet of one Jupiter\nmass and $P_{obs}\\sim $ four days. It grows with the mass of the planet, being\nof order five for a five Jupiter mass planet with the same $P_{orb}$. Thus, the\neffect of stellar rotation may provide a bias in the formation of planetary\nsystems having planets on close orbits around their host stars, as a\nconsequence of planet-planet scattering, favouring systems with retrograde\norbits. The results may also be applied to the problem of tidal capture of\nstars in young stellar clusters. \n\n"}

We\nfind no correlation between the locations of young and old PMS stars, nor do we\nfind a correspondence between the positions of young PMS stars and those of\nmassive OB stars of similar age.

After a contraction timescale which is\nequal to a few times their free-fall times, the cores collapse into stars and\npopulate the IMF. Feedback from the newly formed OB stars is taken into account\nin the form of stellar winds. When the ratio of the effective wind energy of\nthe winds to the gravitational energy of the system reaches unity, gas is\nremoved from the clump and core and star formation are quenched. The power of\nthe radiation driven winds has a strong dependence on metallicity and increases\nwith increasing metallicity. Thus, winds from stars in the high metallicity\nmodels lead to a rapid evacuation of the gas from the protocluster clump and to\na reduced star formation efficiency, SFE_{exp}, as compared to their low\nmetallicity counterparts.

This has important\nramifications for the structure of the Oort Cloud, as it means that the solar\nsystem may have experienced tidal and stellar perturbations that were\nsignificantly different from its current local galactic environment. To\ncharacterize the effects of solar migration within the Milky Way, we use direct\nnumerical simulations to model the formation of an Oort Cloud around stars that\nend up on solar-type orbits in a galactic-scale simulation of a Milky Way-like\ndisk formation. Surprisingly, our simulations indicate that Sedna's orbit may\nbelong to the classical Oort Cloud. Contrary to previous understanding, we show\nthat field star encounters play a pivotal role in setting the Oort Cloud's\nextreme inner edge, and due to their stochastic nature this inner edge\nsometimes extends to Sedna's orbit. The Sun's galactic migration heightens the\nchance of powerful stellar passages, and Sedna production occurs around ~20-30%\nof the solar-like stars we study.

This has been known as the magnetic braking\nproblem and the most investigated mechanism to alleviate this problem and help\nremoving the excess of magnetic flux during the star formation process, the so\ncalled ambipolar diffusion (AD), has been shown to be not sufficient to weaken\nthe magnetic braking at least at this stage of the disk formation. In this\nwork, motivated by recent progress in the understanding of magnetic\nreconnection in turbulent environments, we appeal to the diffusion of magnetic\nfield mediated by magnetic reconnection as an alternative mechanism for\nremoving magnetic flux. We investigate numerically this mechanism during the\nlater phases of the protostellar disk formation and show its high efficiency.\nBy means 3D MHD simulations, we show that this mechanism is able to transport\nmagnetic flux to the outskirts of the disk progenitor at time scales compatible\nwith the collapse, allowing the formation of a rotationally supported disk\naround the protostar of dimensions ~100 AU.

The similarities include hot bubbles\ninflated by jets in a bipolar structure, vortices on the sides of the jets,\nvortices inside the inflated bubbles, fragmentation of bubbles to two and more\nbubbles, and buoyancy of bubbles. The activity in many cases is regulated by a\nnegative feedback mechanism. Namely, higher accretion rate leads to stronger\njet activity that in turn suppresses the accretion process. After the jets\npower decreases the accretion resumes, and the cycle restarts. In the case of\nCF in galaxies and clusters of galaxies we also study the accretion process,\nwhich is most likely by cold clumps, i.e., the cold feedback mechanism.

The light curve exhibits an abrupt\ntransition from a well-defined ~120 day plateau to a steep bolometric decline.\nLeading up to peak brightness, a hot emission-line spectrum exhibits signs of\ninteraction with circumstellar material (CSM), in the form of relatively narrow\nP-Cygni features of H I and He I superimposed on broad Lorentzian wings. For\nthe remainder of the plateau phase the spectrum exhibits strengthening P-Cygni\nprofiles of Fe II, Ca II, and H-alpha. By day 147, after the plateau has ended,\nthe SN entered the nebular phase, heralded by the appearance of forbidden\ntransitions of [O I], [O II], and [Ca II] over a weak continuum. At this stage,\nthe light curve exhibits a low luminosity that is comparable to that\nsub-luminous Type II-P supernovae, and a relatively fast visual-wavelength\ndecline that is significantly steeper than the Co-56 decay rate. However, the\ntotal bolometric decline, including the IR luminosity, is consistent with Co-56\ndecay, and implies a low Ni-56 mass of ~0.01 M(Sun). We therefore characterize\nSN 2011ht as a bona-fide core-collapse SN very similar to the peculiar SNe IIn\n1994W and 2009kn. These three SNe define a subclass, which are Type IIn based\non their spectrum, but that also exhibit well-defined plateaus and produce low\nNi-56 yields.

This feature can be very useful to probe the superdense core\nmatter of neutron stars, and the strong gravity regime. However, although many\nmodels exist in the literature, the physical origin of kHz QPO is not known,\nand hence this feature cannot be used as a tool yet. The energy dependence of\nkHz QPO fractional rms amplitude is an important piece of the jigsaw puzzle to\nunderstand the physical origin of this timing feature. It is known that the\nfractional rms amplitude increases with energy at lower energies. At higher\nenergies, the amplitude is usually believed to saturate, although this is not\nestablished. We combine tens of lower kHz QPOs from a neutron star LMXB 4U\n1728-34 in order to improve the signal-to-noise-ratio. Consequently, we, for\nthe first time to the best of our knowledge, find a significant and systematic\ndecrease of the fractional rms amplitude with energy at higher photon energies.\nAssuming an energy spectrum model, blackbody+powerlaw, we explore if the\nsinusoidal variation of a single spectral parameter can reproduce the above\nmentioned fractional rms amplitude behavior. Our analysis suggests that the\noscillation of any single blackbody parameter is favored over the oscillation\nof any single powerlaw parameter, in order to explain the measured amplitude\nbehavior.

One such case was SN 2009ip, which was recognized to\nbe a luminous blue variable (LBV) eruption. This source had a massive hot\nprogenitor star identified in pre-explosion data, it had documented evidence of\npre-outburst variability, and it was subsequently discovered to have a 2nd\noutburst in 2010. This same source rebrightened again in 2012, and early\nspectra showed the same narrow-line profiles as before, suggesting another\nLBV-like eruption. We present new photometry and spectroscopy of SN 2009ip,\nindicating that it has transitioned into a true SN. The most striking discovery\nin these data is that unlike previous reports, the spectrum exhibited Balmer\nlines with very broad P-Cygni profiles characteristic of normal Type II\nsupernovae (SNe II), in addition to narrow emission lines seen in SNe IIn and\nLBVs. Emission components have FWHM 8000 km/s, while the P-Cygni absorption\ncomponent has blue wings extending to -13,000 km/s. These velocities are\ntypical of SNe II, but have never been associated with emission lines from a\nnonterminal LBV-like eruption. Initially, the peak absolute magnitude seemed\nfainter than that of normal SNe. However, after a brief period of fading, the\nsource quickly brightened again to M_R=-17.5 mag over a couple days. The broad\nlines mostly disappeared, and the spectrum began to resemble the early\noptically thick phases of SNe IIn.

This scenario can be\ninvestigated through deep optical/infrared (IR) observations. We used J, H,\nK-band images, obtained as part of the UK Infrared Telescope (UKIRT) Infrared\nDeep Sky Survey (UKIDSS), and available in the recent Data Release 9 Plus, to\nsearch for its undetected companion of the PSR J1811-1736 binary pulsar. We\ndetected a possible companion star to PSR J1811-1736 within the 3 sigma radio\nposition uncertainty (1.32 arcsec), with magnitudes J=18.61+/-0.07,\nH=16.65+/-0.03, and K=15.46+/-0.02. The star colours are consistent with either\na main sequence (MS) star close to the turn-off or a lower red giant branch\n(RGB) star, at a pulsar distance of ~5.5 kpc and with a reddening of\nE(B-V)~4.9. The star mass and radius would be compatible with the constraints\non the masses and orbital inclination of the binary system inferred from the\nmass function and the lack of radio eclipses near superior conjunction. Thus,\nit is possible that it is the companion to PSR J1811-1736. However, based on\nthe star density in the field, we estimated a quite large chance coincidence\nprobability of ~0.27 between the pulsar and the star, which makes the\nassociation unlikely. No other star is detected within the 3 sigma pulsar radio\nposition down to J~20.5, H~19.4$ and K~18.6, which would allow us to rule out a\nMS companion star earlier than a mid-to-late M spectral type. \n\n"}

This paper shows that several properties of the Crab are best\nsuited to Type IIn-P explosions (Type IIn spectra with plateau light curves).\nThese events probably arise from relatively low-energy (1e50 erg) explosions\nwith low 56Ni yield resulting from electron-capture SNe (ecSNe), but their high\nluminosity and Type IIn spectra are dominated by shock interaction with CSM.\nAfter about 120 days, nearly all of the mass in the CSM and ejecta ends up in a\nslow dense shell. In the scenario proposed here for SN1054, this thin shell is\naccelerated by the growing pulsar wind nebula, producing the complex network of\nfilaments seen today. There is no need to invoke the invisible fast SN envelope\nhypothesized to reside outside the Crab. SNeIIn-P explain several observed\nfeatures of the Crab: (1) No blast wave or rapidly expanding SN envelope\noutside the filaments, (2) a total mass of 5 Msun swept up in a thin shell, (3)\na high peak luminosity despite the low kinetic energy, and (4) chemical\nabundances consistent with an 8-10 Msun star and low 56Ni yield.

To test\npredictions of this model, we have determined binary fractions for 35 clusters.\nHere we present our methodology with a representative globular cluster NGC\n4590.

This reflection essentially occurs where the\nlocal wavelength becomes comparable to the pressure scale height. In close\nbinary stars, the sound speed is a constant on equipotentials, while the\npressure scale height, which depends on the local effective gravity, varies on\nequipotentials and may be much greater near the inner Lagrangian point (L_1).\nAs a result, waves reaching the vicinity of L_1 may propagate unimpeded into\nlow density regions, where they tend to dissipate quickly due to non-linear and\nradiative effects.

Here, we investigate the\ninterplay between stellar mass loss, Galactic tidal perturbations, and stellar\nflybys for evolving stars which host one planet, smaller body or stellar binary\ncompanion and reside in the Milky Way's bulge or disc.

Planetary ejection and collision\nwith the parent star should be more common towards the bulge.

We have found two distinct sequences of BSS: this is the second case,\nafter M 30, where such a feature has been observed. Indeed the BSS location,\ntheir extension in magnitude and color and their radial distribution within the\ncluster nicely resemble those observed in M 30, thus suggesting that the same\ninterpretative scenario can be applied: the red BSS sub-population is generated\nby mass transfer binaries, the blue one by collisions. The discovery of four\nnew W UMa stars, three of which lying along the red-BSS sequence, further\nsupports this scenario. We also found that the inner portion of the density\nprofile deviates from a King model and is well reproduced by either a mild\npower-law (\\alpha -0.2) or a double King profile.

Unbalanced and core evolution Abstract: We introduce version two of the fast star cluster evolution code Evolve Me A\nCluster of StarS (EMACSS). The first version (Alexander & Gieles) assumed that\ncluster evolution is balanced for the majority of the life-cycle, meaning that\nthe rate of energy generation in the core of the cluster equals the diffusion\nrate of energy by two-body relaxation, which makes the code suitable for\nmodelling clusters in weak tidal fields. In this new version we extend the\nmodel to include an unbalanced phase of evolution to describe the pre-collapse\nevolution and the accompanying escape rate such that clusters in strong tidal\nfields can also be modelled. We also add a prescription for the evolution of\nthe core radius and density and a related cluster concentration parameter. The\nmodel simultaneously solves a series of first-order ordinary differential\nequations for the rate of change of the core radius, half-mass radius and the\nnumber of member stars N. About two thousand integration steps in time are\nrequired to solve for the entire evolution of a star cluster and this number is\napproximately independent of N. We compare the model to the variation of these\nparameters following from a series of direct N-body calculations of single-mass\nclusters and find good agreement in the evolution of all parameters. Relevant\ntime-scales, such as the total lifetimes and core collapse times, are\nreproduced with an accuracy of about 10% for clusters with various initial\nhalf-mass radii (relative to their Jacobi radii) and a range of different\ninitial N up to N = 65536. We intend to extend this framework to include more\nrealistic initial conditions, such as a stellar mass spectrum and mass loss\nfrom stars. The EMACSS code can be used in star cluster population studies and\nin models that consider the co-evolution of (globular) star clusters and large\nscale structures. \n\n"}

The protostellar evolution is calculated with a detailed\nmulti-zone model, with the accretion rate regulated by feedback from an\nevolving disk-wind outflow cavity. Disk and envelope evolutions are calculated\nself-consistently. In this framework, an evolutionary track is determined by\nthree environmental initial conditions: the initial core mass M_c, the mean\nsurface density of the ambient star-forming clump Sigma_cl, and the\nrotational-to-gravitational energy ratio of the initial core, beta_c.\nEvolutionary sequences with various M_c, Sigma_cl, beta_c are constructed. We\nfind that in a fiducial model with M_c=60Msun, Sigma_cl=1 g/cm^2 and\nbeta_c=0.02, the final star formation efficiency >~0.43. For each evolutionary\ntrack, RT simulations are performed at selected stages, with temperature\nprofiles, SEDs, and images produced. At a given stage the envelope temperature\nis highly dependent on Sigma_cl, but only weakly dependent on M_c. The SED and\nMIR images depend sensitively on the evolving outflow cavity, which gradually\nwides as the protostar grows. The fluxes at <~100 microns increase\ndramatically, and the far-IR peaks move to shorter wavelengths. We find that,\ndespite scatter caused by different M_c, Sigma_cl, beta, and inclinations,\nsources at a given evolutionary stage appear in similar regions on color-color\ndiagrams, especially when using colors at >~ 70 microns, where the scatter due\nto the inclination is minimized, implying that such diagrams can be useful\ndiagnostic tools of evolutionary stages of massive protostars.

In the context of star\nformation, theoretical studies have recently adopted two different strategies\nwhen considering the ortho:para ratio (OPR) of H2 molecules; the first\nconsiders the OPR to be frozen at 3:1 while the second assumes that the species\nare in thermal equilibrium. As the OPR potentially affects the protostellar\ncores which form as a result of the gravitational collapse of a dense molecular\ncloud, the aim of this paper is to quantify precisely what role the choice of\nOPR plays in the properties and evolution of the cores. We used two different\nideal gas equations of state for a hydrogen and helium mix in a radiation\nhydrodynamics code to simulate the collapse of a dense cloud and the formation\nof the first and second Larson cores; the first equation of state uses a fixed\nOPR of 3:1 while the second assumes thermal equilibrium.

Generally, a static binary lens is considered to fit the observed\nlight curve and, when the orbital motion is taken into account, an\noversimplified model is usually employed. In this paper, we treat the\nbinary-lens motion in a realistic way and focus on simulated events that are\nfitted well by a Paczy\\'nski curve. We show that an accurate timing analysis of\nthe residuals (calculated with respect to the best-fitting Paczy\\'nski model)\nis usually sufficient to infer the orbital period of the binary lens.

In\nthis context, our goal is to understand the PAH spectra of four transitional\ndisks. In addition, we want to explain the observed correlation between PAH\nionization (traced by the 6.2/11.3 feature ratio) and the disk mass (traced by\nthe 1.3 mm luminosity). We implement a model to calculate the charge state of\nPAHs in the radiative transfer code MCMax. The emission spectra and ionization\nbalance are calculated. A benchmark modeling grid is presented that shows how\nPAH ionization and luminosity behave as a function of star and disk properties.\nThe PAH ionization is most sensitive to ultraviolet (UV) radiation and the\nelectron density. In optically thick disks, where the UV field is low and the\nelectron density is high, PAHs are predominantly neutral. Ionized PAHs trace\nlow-density optically thin disk regions where the UV field is high and the\nelectron density is low. Such regions are characteristic of gas flows through\nthe gaps of transitional disks. We demonstrate that fitting the PAH spectra of\nfour transitional disks requires a contribution of ionized PAHs in gas flows\nthrough the gap. The PAH spectra of transitional disks can be understood as\nsuperpositions of neutral and ionized PAHs. For HD97048, neutral PAHs in the\noptically thick disk dominate the spectrum. In the cases of HD169142, HD135344B\nand Oph IRS 48, small amounts of ionized PAHs located in the gas flows through\nthe gap are strong contributors to the total PAH luminosity.

Whether\nlarge scale fields are amplified in situ or a remnant from previous stages of\nan object's history is often debated for objects without a definitive magnetic\nactivity cycle. Magnetic helicity, a measure of twist and linkage of magnetic\nfield lines, is a unifying tool for understanding large scale field evolution\nfor both mechanisms of origin. Its importance stems from its two basic\nproperties: (1) magnetic helicity is typically better conserved than magnetic\nenergy; and (2) the magnetic energy associated with a fixed amount of magnetic\nhelicity is minimized when the system relaxes this helical structure to the\nlargest scale available.

Despite their importance, we have not been able to fully\nquantify the impact of jets and outflows during the formation of a star\ncluster. The main problem lies in limited computing power. We would have to\nresolve the magnetic jet-launching mechanism close to the protostar and at the\nsame time follow the evolution of a parsec-size cloud for a million years.\nCurrent computer power and codes fall orders of magnitude short of achieving\nthis. In order to overcome this problem, we implement a subgrid-scale (SGS)\nmodel for launching jets and outflows, which demonstrably converges and\nreproduces the mass, linear and angular momentum transfer, and the speed of\nreal jets, with ~ 1000 times lower resolution than would be required without\nSGS model. We apply the new SGS model to turbulent, magnetized star cluster\nformation and show that jets and outflows (1) eject about 1/4 of their parent\nmolecular clump in high-speed jets, quickly reaching distances of more than a\nparsec, (2) reduce the star formation rate by about a factor of two, and (3)\nlead to the formation of ~ 1.5 times as many stars compared to the no-outflow\ncase. Most importantly, we find that jets and outflows reduce the average star\nmass by a factor of ~ 3 and may thus be essential for understanding the\ncharacteristic mass of the stellar initial mass function. \n\n"}

We use two different samples of FGK dwarfs to study the effect of\nthe stellar surface gravity on the precise spectroscopic determination of the\nother atmospheric parameters. Furthermore, we present a straightforward formula\nfor correcting the spectroscopic surface gravities derived by our method and\nwith our linelists. Our spectroscopic analysis is based on Kurucz models in\nLTE, performed with the MOOG code to derive the atmospheric parameters.

These are now extended to three dimensions,\nemploying a spherical grid centred on the planet. Compression of gas is shown\nto reduce rotational motions.

Of particular\ninterest is the timescale to replenish the atmosphere by nebular gas,\n$t_\\mathrm{replenish}$.

Abstract: Many things in current interstellar dust studies are taken as well understood\ngivens by much of the community. For example, it is widely held that\ninterstellar dust is made up of only three components, i.e., astronomical\nsilicates, graphite and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and that our\nunderstanding of these is now complete and sufficient enough to interpret\nastronomical observations of dust in galaxies. To zeroth order this is a\nreasonable approximation. However, while these three pillars of dust modelling\nhave been useful in advancing our understanding over the last few decades, it\nis now apparent that they are insufficient to explain the observed evolution of\nthe dust properties from one region to another. Thus, it is time to abandon the\nthree pillars approach and to seek more physically-realistic interstellar dust\nanalogues. The analy- sis of the pre-solar grains extracted from meteorites,\ninterplanetary dust particles and from the Stardust mission, and the\ninterpretation of x-ray scattering and absorption observations, supports the\nview that our current view of the interstellar dust composition(s) is indeed\ntoo naive.

To this aim ten as- pects of interstellar dust will\nbe scrutinised and re-evaluated in terms of their validity within the current\nobservational, experimental, modelling and theoretical constraints.

We simultaneously fit\nthe primary and secondary $O-C$ curves of each system for the light-travel time\neffect (LTTE), as well as dynamical perturbations caused by the tertiary on\ndifferent timescales.

These effects manifest themselves both on the period of the triple\nsystem, $P_2$, and on the longer \"apse-node\" timescale. We demonstrate that\nconsideration of the dynamically forced rapid apsidal motion yields an\nefficient and independent tool for the determination of the binary orbit's\neccentricity and orientation, as well as the 3D configuration of the triple.\nModeling the forced apsidal motion also helps to resolve the degeneracy between\nthe shapes of the LTTE and the dynamical delay terms on the $P_2$ timescale,\ndue to the strong dependence of the apsidal motion period on the triple's mass\nratio. This can lead to the independent determination of the binary and\ntertiary masses without the need for independent radial velocity measurements.\nThrough the use of our analytic method for fitting $O-C$ curves we have\nobtained robust solutions for system parameters for the ten most ideal triples\nof our sample, and only somewhat less robust, but yet acceptable, fits for the\nremaining systems.

In most simulations, a portion of the stripped gas forms a warm dense\ngas ring in the S0 galaxy, with a radius of ~6-13 kpc and a mass of ~10^7 solar\nmasses (Msun). The ring is generally short-lived (<~3 Gyr) if it forms from\nprograde encounters, while it can live for more than 6 Gyr if it is born from\ncounter-rotating or non-coplanar interactions. The gas ring keeps memory of the\ninitial orbit of the satellite galaxy: it is corotating (counter-rotating) with\nthe stars of the disc of the S0 galaxy, if it originates from prograde\n(retrograde) satellite orbits. Furthermore, the ring is coplanar with the disc\nof the S0 galaxy only if the satellite's orbit was coplanar, while it lies on a\nplane that is inclined with respect to the disc of the S0 galaxy by the same\ninclination angle as the orbital plane of the satellite galaxy.

Of the\nobserved high quality and extended rotation curves of these galaxies\ndecompositions have been made, for four different schemes, each with two free\nparameters.

For the alternative gravitational theory of MOND the rotation curves\ncan be explained if the fundamental parameter associated with MOND is allowed\nas a free parameter. Fixing that parameter leads to a disagreement between the\npredicted and observed rotation curves for a few galaxies. When cosmologically\nmotivated NFW dark matter halos are assumed, the rotation curves for the least\nmassive galaxies can, by no means, be reproduced; cores are definitively\npreferred over cusps.

Transverse\nmomentum spectra of baryons from RHIC ($\\sqrt(s)$=62 and 200 GeV) and from LHC\n($\\sqrt(s)$=0.9 and 7 TeV) have been considered.

The\nchange in average transverse momenta that are slowly growing in VHE hadron\ninteractions at CR detectors cannot cause the \"knee\" in measured cosmic ray\nproton spectra. In addition, the available data on heavy quark hadron\nproduction from LHC-b at $\\sqrt{s}$=7 TeV were also studied. The preliminary\ndependence of hadron average transverse momenta on their masses at LHC energy\nis presented. The possible source of cosmic ray antiparticle-to-particle ratios\nthat are growing with energy was analyzed in the framework of QGSM, where the\ngrowing ratios are the result of local leading asymmetry between the production\nspectra of baryons and antibaryons in the kinematical region of proton target\nfragmentation.

The ratio of primordial to enriched\nstars thus has a U-shaped dependency on radius with a minimum near the\nhalf-light radius.

In\nthe combined model, where the densities are low enough that at least some part\nof the spectrum is optically thin, a model of the thermodynamics of the diffuse\nISM is more significant in setting the temperatures. Where the densities are\nhigh enough to be optically thick across the spectrum, a model of flux limited\ndiffusion is more appropriate. Previous methods either model the low-density\ninterstellar medium and ignore the thermal behaviour at high densities (e.g.\ninside collapsing molecular cloud cores), or model the thermal behaviour near\nprotostars but assume a fixed background temperature (e.g. approximately 10 K)\non large-scales.

In general, the dependence on age weakens for ages greater\nthan ~ 6 Gyr, and results even less sensitive to age as the metallicity\ndecreases. For ages younger than ~ 5 Gyr deltaT1 shows a strong correlation\nwith both age and metallicity. The deltaC index -defined as deltaT1 for the C\npassband- is also a combined measurement of age and metallicity.

Here we use high-resolution\nhydrodynamical simulations with grid resolutions of up to 1024^3 cells to model\ncompressible turbulence in a regime similar to the observed interstellar\nmedium. We use Fyris Alpha, a shock-capturing code employing a high-order\nGodunov scheme to track large density variations induced by shocks. We\ninvestigate the robustness of the standard relation between the logarithmic\ndensity variance (sigma_s^2) and the sonic Mach number (M) of isothermal\ninterstellar turbulence, in the non-isothermal regime. Specifically, we test\nideal gases with diatomic molecular (gamma = 7/5) and monatomic (gamma = 5/3)\nadiabatic indices. A periodic cube of gas is stirred with purely solenoidal\nforcing at low wavenumbers, leading to a fully-developed turbulent medium. We\nfind that as the gas heats in adiabatic compressions, it evolves along the\nrelationship in the density variance - Mach number plane, but deviates\nsignificantly from the standard expression for isothermal gases. Our main\nresult is a new density variance - Mach number relation that takes the\nadiabatic index into account: sigma_s^2 = ln {1+b^2*M^[(5*gamma+1)/3]} and\nprovides good fits for b*M <= 1.

Early on it showed typical characteristics shared by SNe IIb/Ib/Ic\ndominated by metal emission lines, while later on it was dominated by broad and\nflat-topped Halpha and He I emissions. The late-time spectra are strikingly\nsimilar to SN IIb 1993J, which is the only previous example clearly showing the\nsame transition. This late-time evolution is fully explained by a change in the\nenergy input from the $^{56}$Co decay to the interaction between the SN ejecta\nand dense circumstellar matter (CSM). The mass loss rate is derived to be ~(5.4\n+- 3.2) x 10^{-5} Msun/yr (for the wind velocity of ~20 km/s), similar to SN\n1993J but larger than SN IIb 2011dh by an order of magnitude.

We find that when surface gravities are derived spectroscopically\n(by imposing to obtain the same iron abundance from FeI and FeII lines) the\n[Fe/H] distribution spans ~0.5 dex, according to previous analyses. However,\nthe gravities obtained in this way correspond to unrealistic low stellar masses\n(0.1-0.5 Msun) for most of the surveyed giants. Instead, when photometric\ngravities are adopted, the [FeII/H] distribution shows no evidence of spread at\nvariance with the [FeI/H] distribution. This difference has been recently\nobserved in other clusters and could be due to non-local thermodynamical\nequilibrium effects driven by over-ionization mechanisms, that mainly affect\nthe neutral species (thus providing lower [FeI/H]) but leave [FeII/H]\nunaltered. We confirm that the s-process elements show significant star-to-star\nvariations and their abundances appear to be correlated with the difference\nbetween [FeI/H] and [FeII/H].

Spectrophotometric data of 11 PNe and two H II regions were obtained\nwith the OSIRIS spectrograph attached to the Gran Telescopio Canarias. Data for\nother 13 PNe and three H II regions were retrieved from the literature.\nPhysical conditions and chemical abundances of O, N, Ne, Ar and S were derived\nfor 19 PNe and 4 H II regions. Abundances in the PNe sample are widely\ndistributed showing 12+log(O/H) from 7.4 to 8.2 and 12+log(Ar/H) from 4.97 to\n5.80. Two groups of PNe can be differentiated: one old, with low metallicity\n(12+log(O/H)<8.0 and 12+log(Ar/H)<5.7) and another younger with metallicities\nsimilar to the values of H II regions. The old objects are distributed in a\nlarger volume than the young ones. An important fraction of PNe (>30%) was\nfound to be highly N-rich (Type I PNe). Such PNe occur at any metallicity. In\naddition, about 60% of the sample presents high ionization (He++/He >= 0.1),\npossessing a central star with effective temperature larger than 10^6 K.\nPossible biases in the sample are discussed. From comparison with stellar\nevolution models by A.

However, about a third of the more massive galaxies at those times\nwere quiescent in the sense that their observed stellar populations are\ninconsistent with rapid star formation. The reduced star formation activity is\noften attributed to gaseous outflows driven by feedback from supermassive black\nholes, but the impact of black hole feedback on galaxies in the young Universe\nis not yet definitively established. We analyze the origin of quiescent\ngalaxies with the help of ultra-high resolution, cosmological simulations that\ninclude feedback from stars but do not model the uncertain consequences of\nblack hole feedback. We show that dark matter halos with specific accretion\nrates below ~0.25-0.4 per Gyr preferentially host galaxies with reduced star\nformation rates and red broad-band colors. The fraction of such halos in large\ndark matter only simulations matches the observed fraction of massive quiescent\ngalaxies (~10^10-10^11 Msun). This strongly suggests that halo accretion rate\nis the key parameter determining which massive galaxies at z~1.5-3 become\nquiescent. Empirical models that connect galaxy and halo evolution, such as\nhalo occupation distribution or abundance matching models, assume a tight link\nbetween galaxy properties and the masses of their parent halos.

If NSBM are indeed solely responsible for the solar system r-\nprocess abundances, a galaxy like our own would require to host a few NSBM per\nmillion years, with each event ejecting, on average, about 5x10^{-2} M_sun of\nr-process material. Because the ejecta velocities in the tidal tail are\nsignificantly larger than in ordinary supernovae, NSBM deposit a comparable\namount of energy into the interstellar medium (ISM). In contrast to extensive\nefforts studying spherical models for supernova remnant evolution, calculations\nquantifying the impact of NSBM ejecta in the ISM have been lacking. To better\nunderstand their evolution in a cosmological context, we perform a suite of\nthree-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations with optically-thin radiative\ncooling of isolated NSBM ejecta expanding in environments with conditions\nadopted from Milky Way-like galaxy simulations. Although the remnant morphology\nis highly complex at early times, the subsequent radiative evolution that\nresults from thermal instability in atomic gas is remarkably similar to that of\na standard supernova blast wave.

Finally, some SNe Iax have spectra intermediate to\nthese two varieties with weak P-Cygni features and broad/narrow forbidden lines\nof similar strength. We find that SNe Iax with strong broad forbidden lines\nalso tend to be more luminous and have higher-velocity ejecta at peak\nbrightness.

Motivated by this finding we\ninvestigate the hypothesis that collisions of stars with a fragmenting\naccretion disk are responsible for the observed dearth of evolved stars. We use\n3-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations to model a star with radius $10\nR_{\\odot}$ and mass $1 M_{\\odot}$, representative of the missing population of\nRGs, colliding with high density clumps. We find that multiple collisions with\nclumps of column density $\\gtrsim10^{8}\\, {\\rm g\\,cm^{-2}}$ can strip a\nsubstantial fraction of the star's envelope and in principle render it\ninvisible to observations. Simulations confirm that repeated impacts are\nparticularly efficient in driving mass loss as partially stripped RGs expand\nand have increased cross sections for subsequent collisions. Because the\nenvelope is unbound on account of the kinetic energy of the star, any\nsignificant amount of stripping of the RG population in the GC should be\nmirrored by a systematic decay of their orbits and possibly by their enhanced\nrotational velocity.

The sample was initially selected from 1.65 deg^2 of ground-based imaging in\nthe UltraVISTA/COSMOS and UDS/SXDS fields, and includes the extreme Lyman-alpha\nemitters, `Himiko' and `CR7'. A deconfusion analysis of the deep Spitzer\nphotometry available suggests that these galaxies exhibit strong rest-frame\noptical nebular emission lines (EW_0(H_beta + [OIII]) > 600A). We find that\nirregular, multiple-component morphologies suggestive of clumpy or merging\nsystems are common (f_multi > 0.4) in bright z ~ 7 galaxies, and ubiquitous at\nthe very bright end (M_UV < -22.5). The galaxies have half-light radii in the\nrange r_1/2 ~ 0.5-3 kpc. The size measurements provide the first determination\nof the size-luminosity relation at z ~ 7 that extends to M_UV ~ -23. We find\nthe relation to be steep with r_1/2 ~ L^1/2. Excluding clumpy, multi-component\ngalaxies however, we find a shallower relation that implies an increased\nstar-formation rate surface density in bright LBGs. Using the new, independent,\nHST/WFC3 data we confirm that the rest-frame UV luminosity function at z ~ 7\nfavours a power-law decline at the bright-end, compared to an exponential\nSchechter function drop-off. Finally, these results have important implications\nfor the Euclid mission, which we predict will detect > 1000 similarly bright\ngalaxies at z ~ 7.

By means of N-body simulations, we investigate if merging is\nconsistent with the observations of sub-populations and rotation in\niron-complex GCs. The key parameters are the initial mass and density ratios of\nthe progenitors. When densities are similar, the more massive progenitor\ndominates the central part of the merger remnant and the less massive\nprogenitor forms an extended rotating population. The low-mass progenitor can\nbecome the majority population in the central regions of the merger remnant\nonly if its initial density is higher by roughly the mass ratio.

This strongly conflicts with the traditional view of\nthe dominant star-formation mode in stellar clusters, which are thought of as\nsingle-aged stellar populations. Here we present a test of this interpretation\nby exploring the morphology of the subgiant branch (SGB) of NGC 411, which\nhosts possibly the most extended eMSTO among all known intermediate-age star\nclusters. We show that the width of the NGC 411 SGB favours the single-aged\nstellar population interpretation and rules out an extended SFH. In addition,\nwhen considering the red clump (RC) morphology and adopting the unproven\npremise that the widths of all features in the colour--magnitude diagram are\ndetermined by an underlying range in ages, we find that the SFH implied is\nstill very close to that resulting from a single-aged stellar population, with\na minor fraction of stars scattering to younger ages compared with the bulk of\nthe population. The SFHs derived from the SGB and RC are both inconsistent with\nthe SFH derived from the eMSTO region. NGC 411 has a very low escape velocity\nand it has unlikely undergone significant mass loss at an early stage, thus\nindicating that it may lack the capacity to capture most of its initial,\nexpelled gas from stellar evolutionary processes, a condition often required\nfor extended SFHs to take root. \n\n"}

This hybrid model is constructed by allowing\nthe surface flux transport (SFT) simulation described in Lemerle et al. 2015 to\nprovide the poloidal source term to an axisymmetric FTD simulation defined in a\nmeridional plane, which in turn generates the BMRs required by the SFT. A key\naspect of this coupling is the definition of an emergence function describing\nthe probability of BMR emergence as a function of the spatial distribution of\nthe internal axisymmetric magnetic field. We use a genetic algorithm to\ncalibrate this function, together with other model parameters, against observed\ncycle 21 emergence data. We present a reference dynamo solution reproducing\nmany solar cycle characteristics, including good hemispheric coupling, phase\nrelationship between the surface dipole and the BMR-generating internal field,\nand correlation between dipole strength at cycle maximum and peak amplitude of\nthe next cycle. The saturation of the cycle amplitude takes place through the\nquenching of the BMR tilt as a function of the internal field. The observed\nstatistical scatter about the mean BMR tilt, built into the model, acts as a\nsource of stochasticity which dominates amplitude fluctuations. The model thus\ncan produce Dalton-like epochs of strongly suppressed cycle amplitude lasting a\nfew cycles and can even shut off entirely following an unfavorable sequence of\nemergence events. \n\n"}

HARPS\nspectra with S/N > 600 are used to derive very precise (+/- 0.01 dex)\ndifferential abundances, and stellar ages with internal errors less than 1 Gyr\nare obtained by interpolation in the logg - Teff diagram between isochrones\ncalculated with the Aarhus Stellar Evolution Code. For stars younger than 6\nGyr, [X/Fe] is tightly correlated with stellar age for all elements. For ages\nbetween 6 and 9 Gyr, the [X/Fe] - age correlations break down and the stars\nsplit up into two groups having respectively high and low [X/Fe] for the odd-Z\nelements. It is concluded that while stars in the solar neighborhood younger\nthan about 6 Gyr were formed from interstellar gas with a smooth chemical\nevolution, older stars have originated from regions enriched by supernovae with\ndifferent neutron excesses. Furthermore, the correlations between abundance\nratios and stellar age suggest that: i) Sc is made in Type II supernovae along\nwith the alpha-capture elements, ii) the Type II to Ia SNe yield ratio is about\nthe same for Mn and Fe, iii) Cu is mainly made by the weak s-process in massive\nstars, iv) the Ba/Y yield ratio for AGB stars increases with decreasing stellar\nmass, v) [Y/Mg] and [Y/Al] can be used as \"chemical clocks\" when determining\nages of solar metallicity stars. \n\n"}

The jet seen in [O I] emission is spatially\naligned with the Spitzer/IRAC 4.5 micron jet and the CO (6-5) molecular outflow\ncentered on FIR 3. The mass loss rate derived from the total [O I] 63 micron\nline luminosity of the jet is 7.7 x 10^-6 M_sun/yr, more than an order of\nmagnitude higher than that measured for typical low mass class 0 protostars.\nThe implied accretion luminosity is significantly higher than the observed\nbolometric luminosity of FIR 4, indicating that the [O I] jet is unlikely to be\nassociated with FIR 4. We argue that the peak line emission seen toward FIR 4\noriginates in the terminal shock produced by the jet driven by FIR 3. The\nhigher mass-loss rate that we find for FIR 3 is consistent with the idea that\nintermediate mass protostars drive more powerful jets than their low-mass\ncounterparts. Our results also call into question the nature of FIR 4. \n\n"}

We use the IRAM 30m telescope and the PdBI to study\nthe chemical and physical properties of the starless core FeSt 1-457 (Core\n109), in the Pipe nebula. We fit the hyperfine structure of the N2H+(1-0) IRAM\n30m data.

We use a modified Bonnor-Ebert sphere model adding a temperature\ngradient towards the center to fit the 1.2 mm continuum emission and visual\nextinction maps. Using this model, we estimate the abundances of the N2H+ and\nthe rest of molecular lines detected in the 30 GHz wide line survey performed\nat 3 mm with IRAM 30m using ARTIST software. The core presents a rich chemistry\nwith emission from early (C3H2, HCN, CS) and late-time molecules (e.g., N2H+),\nwith a clear chemical spatial differentiation for nitrogen, oxygen and\nsulphurated molecules. For most of the molecules detected (HCN, HCO+, CH3OH,\nCS, SO, 13CO and C18O), abundances are best fitted with three values,\npresenting a clear decrease of abundance of at least 1 or 2 orders of magnitude\ntowards the center of the core. The Bonnor-Ebert analysis indicates the core is\ngravitationally unstable and the magnetic field is not strong enough to avoid\nthe collapse. Depletion of molecules onto the dust grains occurs at the\ninterior of the core, where dust grain growth and dust depolarization also\noccurs. This suggests that these properties may be related. On the other hand,\nsome molecules exhibit asymmetries in their integrated emission maps, which\nappear to be correlated with a previously reported submillimetre polarization\nasymmetry. These asymmetries could be due to a stronger interstellar radiation\nfield in the western side of the core. \n\n"}

Determining gas\nand dust mass-loss rates (MLRs) is important in quantifying the contribution of\nevolved stars to the enrichment of the interstellar medium. Aims: Attempt to,\nfor the first time, spectrally resolve CO thermal line emission in a small\nsample of AGB stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Methods: ALMA was used to\nobserve 2 OH/IR stars and 4 carbon stars in the LMC in the CO J= 2-1 line.\nResults: We present the first measurement of expansion velocities in\nextragalactic carbon stars. All four C-stars are detected and wind expansion\nvelocities and stellar velocities are directly measured. Mass-loss rates are\nderived from modelling the spectral energy distribution and Spitzer/IRS\nspectrum with the DUSTY code. Gas-to-dust ratios are derived that make the\npredicted velocities agree with the observed ones. The expansion velocities and\nMLRs are compared to a Galactic sample of well-studied relatively low MLRs\nstars supplemented with \"extreme\" C-stars that have properties more similar to\nthe LMC targets. Gas MLRs derived from a simple formula are significantly\nsmaller than derived from the dust modelling, indicating an order of magnitude\nunderestimate of the estimated CO abundance, time-variable mass loss, or that\nthe CO intensities in LMC stars are lower than predicted by the formula derived\nfor Galactic objects. This could be related to a stronger interstellar\nradiation field in the LMC. Conclusions: Although the LMC sample is small and\nthe comparison to Galactic stars is non-trivial because of uncertainties in\ntheir distances it appears that for C stars the wind expansion velocities in\nthe LMC are lower than in the solar neighbourhood, while the MLRs appear\nsimilar. This is in agreement with dynamical dust-driven wind models. \n\n"}

Abstract: Supermassive stars (SMS; ~ 10^5 M_sun) formed from metal-free gas in the\nearly Universe attract attention as progenitors of supermassive black holes\nobserved at high redshifts. To form SMSs by accretion, central protostars must\naccrete at as high rates as ~ 0.1-1 M_sun/yr. Such protostars have very\nextended structures with bloated envelopes, like super-giant stars, and are\ncalled super-giant protostars (SGPSs). Under the assumption of hydrostatic\nequilibrium, SGPSs have density inverted layers, where the luminosity becomes\nlocally super-Eddington, near the surface. If the envelope matter is allowed to\nflow out, however, a stellar wind could be launched and hinder the accretion\ngrowth of SGPSs before reaching the supermassive regime. We examine whether\nradiation-driven winds are launched from SGPSs by constructing steady and\nspherically symmetric wind solutions. We find that the wind velocity does not\nreach the escape velocity in any case considered. This is because once the\ntemperature falls below ~ 10^4 K, the opacity plummet drastically owing to the\nrecombination of hydrogen and the acceleration ceases suddenly. This indicates\nthat, in realistic non-steady cases, even if outflows are launched from the\nsurface of SGPSs, they would fall back again. Such a \"wind\" does not result in\nnet mass loss and does not prevent the growth of SGPSs. In conclusion, SGPSs\nwill grow to SMSs and eventually collapse to massive BHs of ~ 10^5 M_sun, as\nlong as the rapid accretion is maintained. \n\n"}

For this purpose, precise predictions of the surface chemical\ncomposition before and after the mixing takes place in the convective envelope\nof subgiant stars are necessary.

In order to obtain empirical constraints\non black hole progenitor spin, we infer wind asymmetries in all 12 known WR\nstars in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) at Z = 1/5 Zsun, as well as within a\nsignificantly enlarged sample of single and binary WR stars in the Large\nMagellanic Cloud (LMC at Z = 1/2 Zsun), tripling the sample of Vink (2007).\nThis brings the total LMC sample to 39, making it appropriate for comparison to\nthe Galactic sample.

Metal-poor stars with [Fe/H] < -0.5 show strong kinematic variations\nwith metallicity, indicating varying contributions from the underlying stellar\npopulations.

M17 is one of the\nbest studied HII regions in the sky, is relatively nearby, and hosts a young\nstellar population. With X-shooter on the ESO Very Large Telescope we have\nobtained optical to near-infrared spectra of candidate mYSOs, identified by\nHanson et al. (1997), and a few OB stars in this region. The large wavelength\ncoverage enables a detailed spectroscopic analysis of their photospheres and\ncircumstellar disks. We confirm the pre-main sequence (PMS) nature of six of\nthe stars and characterise the O stars. The PMS stars have radii consistent\nwith being contracting towards the main sequence and are surrounded by a\nremnant accretion disk. The observed infrared excess and the (double-peaked)\nemission lines provide the opportunity to measure structured velocity profiles\nin the disks.

In\norder to apply an empirical completeness correction, existing works limit the\nsurvey depth to the shallower parts of the sky that hamper the maximum\npotential of a survey.

Most embedded binary systems are\nfound toward the centres of their parent cores, although several systems have\ncomponents closer to the core edge. Wide binaries, defined as those systems\nwith physical separations greater than 500 au, show a tendency to be aligned\nwith the long axes of their parent cores, whereas tight binaries show no\npreferred orientation. We test a number of simple, evolutionary models to\naccount for the observed populations of Class 0 and I sources, both single and\nbinary. In the model that best explains the observations, all stars form\ninitially as wide binaries. These binaries either break up into separate stars\nor else shrink into tighter orbits. Under the assumption that both stars remain\nembedded following binary breakup, we find a total star formation rate of 168\nMyr^-1. Alternatively, one star may be ejected from the dense core due to\nbinary breakup. This latter assumption results in a star formation rate of 247\nMyr^-1.

The competitive\naccretion theory of massive star formation posits that the most massive stars\nshould sit in deeper potential wells than lower-mass stars. This may be\nobservable in the relative surface density or spatial concentration of the most\nmassive stars compared to other, lower-mass stars. Massive stars in\ncool--collapse N-body models do end up in significantly deeper potentials, and\nare mass segregated. However, in models of warm (expanding) star-forming\nregions, whilst the massive stars do come to be in deeper potentials than\naverage stars, they are not mass segregated. In the purely hydrodynamical SPH\nsimulations, the massive stars do come to reside in deeper potentials, which is\ndue to their runaway growth. However, when photoionisation and stellar winds\nare implemented in the simulations, these feedback mechanisms regulate the mass\nof the stars and disrupt the inflow of gas into the clouds' potential wells.\nThis generally makes the potential wells shallower than in the control runs,\nand prevents the massive stars from occupying deeper potentials. This in turn\nresults in the most massive stars having a very similar spatial concentration\nand surface density distribution to lower-mass stars. Whilst massive stars do\nform via competitive accretion in our simulations, this rarely translates to a\ndifferent spatial distribution and so any lack of primordial mass segregation\nin an observed star-forming region does not preclude competitive accretion as a\nviable formation mechanism for massive stars. \n\n"}

It is then important to study variations of evolutionary\nchannels for merging BHs, which might instead form accreting BHs and become\nULXs.

We study similar\nsystems by computing ~120000 detailed binary models with the MESA code covering\na wide range of initial parameters. For initial mass ratios M2/M1~0.1-0.4,\nprimaries >40Msun can evolve chemically homogeneously, remaining compact and\nforming a BH without undergoing Roche-lobe overflow.

We predict that ~1 out of\n10^4 massive stars evolves this way, and that in the local universe 0.13 ULXs\nper Msun yr^-1 of star-formation rate are observable, with a strong preference\nfor low-metallicities. At metallicities log Z>-3, BH masses in ULXs are limited\nto 60Msun due to the occurrence of pair-instability supernovae which leave no\nremnant, resulting in an X-ray luminosity cut-off. At lower metallicities, very\nmassive stars can avoid exploding as pair-instability supernovae and instead\nform BHs with masses above 130Msun, producing a gap in the ULX luminosity\ndistribution. After the ULX phase, neutron-star-BH binaries that merge in less\nthan a Hubble time are produced with a formation rate <0.2 Gpc^-3 yr^-1.

In order to understand the origin of\nsuch abundance spreads, we numerically investigate GC formation from massive\nmolecular clouds (MCs) with fractal structures using our new hydrodynamical\nsimulations with star formation and feedback effects of supernovae (SNe) and\nasymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. We particularly investigate star formation\nfrom gas chemically contaminated by SNe and AGB stars within MCs with different\ninitial conditions and environments. The principal results are as follows. GCs\nwith multiple generation of stars can be formed from merging of hierarchical\nstar cluster complexes that are developed from high-density regions of fractal\nMCs. Feedback effects of SNe and AGB stars can control the formation\nefficiencies of stars formed from original gas of MCs and from gas ejected from\nAGB stars. The simulated GCs have radial gradients of helium abundances within\nthe central 3 pc. The original MC masses need to be as large as 10^7 Msun for a\ncanonical initial stellar mass function (IMF) so that the final masses of stars\nformed from AGB ejecta can be 10^5 Msun. Since star formation from AGB ejecta\nis rather prolonged (10^8 yr), their formation can be strongly suppressed by\nSNe of the stars themselves. This result implies that the so-called mass budget\nproblem is much more severe than ever thought in the self-enrichment scenario\nof GC formation. and thus that IMF for the second generation of stars should be\n`top-light'. \n\n"}

The cluster-to-star\nratio decreases with increasing metallicity by a factor of 100-1000, at all\ngalactocentric radii and with a slope that does not seem to depend on radius.\nIn dwarf galaxies, the GCs are also more metal-poor than the field stars on\naverage. These observations indicate a strong dependence of either the cluster\nformation efficiency or the cluster destruction rate on metallicity and\nenvironment. We aim to explain these trends by considering various effects that\nmay influence the observed cluster-to-star ratio as a function of metallicity,\nenvironment and cosmological history. We show that both the cluster formation\nefficiency and the maximum cluster mass increase with metallicity, so they\ncannot explain the observed trend. Destruction of GCs by tidal stripping and\ndynamical friction destroy clusters over too small a range of galactocentric\nradii. We show that cluster destruction by tidal shocks from giant molecular\nclouds in the high-density formation environments of GCs becomes increasingly\nefficient towards high galaxy masses and, hence, towards high metallicities.\nThe predicted cluster-to-star ratio decreases by a factor 100-1000 towards high\nmetallicities and should only weakly depend on galactocentric radius due to\norbital mixing during hierarchical galaxy merging, consistent with the\nobservations. The observed, strong dependence of the cluster-to-star ratio on\nmetallicity and the independence of its slope on galactocentric radius can be\nexplained by cluster destruction and hierarchical galaxy growth. As a result,\nwe find that the metallicity-dependence of the cluster-to-star ratio does not\nreflect a GC formation efficiency, but a survival fraction. (Abridged) \n\n"}

In this\nscenario, stars with no/little abundance variations first form from a massive\nmolecular cloud (MC). After all of the remaining gas of the MC is expelled by\nnumerous supernovae, gas ejected from asymptotic giant branch stars can be\naccumulated in the central region of the GC to form a high-density\nintra-cluster medium (ICM). Merging of neutron stars then occurs to eject\nr-process elements, which can be efficiently trapped in and subsequently mixed\nwith the ICM. New stars formed from the ICM can have r-process abundances quite\ndifferent from those of earlier generations of stars within the GC. This\nscenario can explain both (i) why r-process elements can be trapped within GCs\nand (ii) why GCs with internal abundance spreads in r-process elements do not\nshow [Fe/H] spreads.

Such measurements provide statistical constraints that can be used to\ninform our understanding of the initial conditions of planet formation. We\nanalyze spatially resolved observations of 36 protoplanetary disks in the Lupus\nstar forming complex from our ALMA survey at 890 micron, aiming to determine\nphysical properties such as the dust surface density, the disk mass and size\nand to provide a constraint on the temperature profile. We fit the observations\ndirectly in the uv-plane using a two-layer disk model that computes the 890\nmicron emission by solving the energy balance at each disk radius. For 22 out\nof 36 protoplanetary disks we derive robust estimates of their physical\nproperties. The sample covers stellar masses between ~0.1 and ~2 Solar masses,\nand we find no trend between the average disk temperatures and the stellar\nparameters.

Comparing these results with observations at\nsimilar angular resolution of Taurus-Auriga/Ophiuchus disks found in literature\nand scaling them to the same distance, we observe that the Lupus disks are\ngenerally fainter and larger at a high level of statistical significance.\nConsidering the 1-2 Myr age difference between these regions, it is possible to\ntentatively explain the offset in the disk mass/disk size relation with viscous\nspreading, however with the current measurements other mechanisms cannot be\nruled out. \n\n"}

Recent\nhydrodynamical simulations of star cluster formation have also produced star\nclusters with this structure. We argue analytically that this type of mass\ndistribution arises naturally in the relaxation from a hierarchically-clustered\ndistribution of stars into a monolithic star cluster through hierarchical\nmerging. We show that arbitrary initial profiles will tend to converge to a\nuniversal profile under hierarchical merging, owing to phase-space mixing\nobeying certain conservation constraints. We perform $N$-body simulations of a\npairwise merger of model star clusters and find that mergers readily produce\nthe shallow surface brightness profiles observed in young massive clusters.\nFinally, we simulate the relaxation of a hierarchically-clustered mass\ndistribution constructed from an idealized fragmentation model. Assuming only\npower-law spatial and kinematic scaling relations, these numerical experiments\nare able to reproduce the surface density profiles of observed young massive\nstar clusters. Thus we provide physical motivation for the structure of young\nmassive clusters within the paradigm of hierarchical star formation. This has\nimportant implications for the structure of nascent globular clusters. \n\n"}

The sub-mm emission began\nto brighten in September 2016, reached a peak brightness of $1.5$ times the\nfaint state, and has been decaying slowly since February 2017.

Classically, polarization\nis expected from non-spherical grains aligned with the magnetic field.\nRecently, two alternatives have been suggested. One polarization mechanism is\ncaused by self-scattering from dust grains of sizes comparable to the\nwavelength while the other mechanism is due to grains aligned with their short\naxes along the direction of radiation anisotropy. The latter has recently been\nshown as a likely mechanism for causing the dust polarization detected in HL\nTau at 3.1 mm. In this paper, we present ALMA polarization observations of HL\nTau for two more wavelengths: 870 $\\mu$m and 1.3 mm. The morphology at 870\n$\\mu$m matches the expectation for self-scattering, while that at 1.3 mm shows\na mix between self-scattering and grains aligned with the radiation anisotropy.\nThe observations cast doubt on the ability of (sub)millimeter continuum\npolarization to probe disk magnetic fields for at least HL Tau. By showing two\ndistinct polarization morphologies at 870 $\\mu$m and 3.1 mm and a transition\nbetween the two at 1.3 mm, this paper provides definitive evidence that the\ndominant (sub)millimeter polarization mechanism transitions with wavelength. In\naddition, if the polarization at 870 $\\mu$m is due to scattering, the lack of\npolarization asymmetry along the minor axis of the inclined disk implies that\nthe large grains responsible for the scattering have already settled into a\ngeometrically thin layer, and the presence of asymmetry along the major axis\nindicates that the HL Tau disk is not completely axisymmetric. \n\n"}

We investigate if the Lupus I molecular could have formed in a\ncolliding flow, and how the kinematics of the cloud might have been influenced\nby the larger scale gas dynamics. We performed APEX 13CO and C18O observations\nof three parts of Lupus. We compare these results to the atomic hydrogen data\nfrom the GASS HI survey and our dust emission results presented in the previous\npaper. Based on the velocity information, we present a geometric model for the\ninteraction zone between the USco shell and the UCL wind bubble. We present\nevidence that the molecular gas of Lupus I is tightly linked to the atomic\nmaterial of the USco shell. The CO emission in Lupus I is found mainly at\nvelocities in the same range as the HI velocities. Thus, the molecular cloud is\nco-moving with the expanding USco atomic Hi shell. The gas in the cloud shows a\ncomplex kinematic structure with several line-of-sight components that overlay\neach other. The non-thermal velocity dispersion is in the transonic regime in\nall parts of the cloud and could be injected by external compression.

The study of the fragmentation process has been motivated\nby simple analytical models. However, only a few comprehensive studies have\nanalysed the evolution of filaments using numerical simulations where the\nfilaments form self-consistently as part of molecular clouds. We address the\nearly evolution of pc-scale filaments that form within individual clouds. We\nfocus on three questions: How do the line masses of filaments evolve? How and\nwhen do the filaments fragment? How does the fragmentation relate to the line\nmasses of the filaments? We examine three simulated molecular clouds formed in\nkpc-scale numerical simulations performed with the FLASH code. We compare the\nproperties of the identified filaments with the predictions of analytic\nfilament stability models. The line masses and mass fraction enclosed in the\nidentified filaments increase continuously after the onset of self-gravity.

They Bose-Einstein condense into a superfluid phase in the\ncentral regions of galaxy halos. The superfluid phonon excitations in turn\ncouple to baryons and mediate an additional long-range force. For a suitable\nchoice of the superfluid equation of state, this force can mimic Milgrom's law.\nIn this paper we develop in detail some of the main phenomenological\nconsequences of such a formalism, by revisiting the expected dark matter halo\nprofile in the presence of an extended baryon distribution. In particular, we\nshow how rotation curves of both high and low surface brightness galaxies can\nbe reproduced, with a slightly rising rotation curve at large radii in massive\nhigh surface brightness galaxies, thus subtly different from Milgrom's law.

The observed S2H abundance is ~5x10$^{-11}$, only a factor\n4-6 lower than that of the widespread H2S molecule. H2S and S2H are efficiently\nformed on the UV-irradiated icy grain mantles.

The case\n  of electron scattering Abstract: Bow shocks and related density enhancements produced by the winds of massive\nstars moving through the interstellar medium provide important information\nregarding the motions of the stars, the properties of their stellar winds, and\nthe characteristics of the local medium. Since bow shocks are aspherical\nstructures, light scattering within them produces a net polarization signal\neven if the region is spatially unresolved. Scattering opacity arising from\nfree electrons and dust leads to a distribution of polarized intensity across\nthe bow shock structure. That polarization encodes information about the shape,\ncomposition, opacity, density, and ionisation state of the material within the\nstructure. In this paper we use the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code SLIP to\ninvestigate the polarization created when photons scatter in a bow shock-shaped\nregion of enhanced density surrounding a stellar source. We present results\nassuming electron scattering, and investigate the polarization behaviour as a\nfunction of optical depth, temperature, and source of photons for two different\ncases: pure scattering and scattering with absorption.

But\ndetermining oxygen abundances in stars has proven challenging, because of the\nshortage of detectable atomic oxygen lines in their optical spectra as well as\nobservational and theoretical complications with these lines (e.g., blends, 3D,\nnon-LTE). Nonetheless, Ting et al. (2017) were recently able to demonstrate\nthat oxygen abundances can be determined from low-resolution (R$\\simeq$2000)\noptical spectra. Here we investigate the physical processes that enable such a\nmeasurement for cool stars, such as K-giants. We show that the strongest\nspectral diagnostics of oxygen come from the CNO atomic-molecular network, but\nare manifested in spectral features that do not involve oxygen. In the outer\natmosphere layers most of the carbon is locked up in CO, and changes to the\noxygen abundance directly affect the abundances of all other carbon-bearing\nmolecules, thereby changing the strength of CH, CN, and C$_2$ features across\nthe optical spectrum. In deeper atmosphere layers most of the carbon is in\natomic form, and any change in the oxygen abundance has little effect on the\nother carbon-bearing molecules. The key physical effect enabling such oxygen\nabundance measurements is that spectral features in the optical arise from both\nthe CO-dominant and the atomic carbon-dominant regions, providing\nnon-degenerate constraints on both C and O. Beyond the case at hand, the\nresults show that physically sound abundances measurements need not be limited\nto those elements that have observable lines themselves. \n\n"}

Studies using\npopulation synthesis models have incorporated this by assuming a broad,\nuniversal (i.e. does not depend on the host galaxy properties) probability\ndistribution for AGN specific X-ray luminosities (i.e. the ratio of $L_X$ to\nhost stellar mass; a common proxy for Eddington ratio). However, recent studies\nhave demonstrated that this universal Eddington ratio distribution fails to\nreproduce the observed X-ray luminosity functions beyond z$\\sim$1.2.\nFurthermore, empirical studies have recently shown that the Eddington ratio\ndistribution may instead depend upon host galaxy properties, such as SFR and/or\nstellar mass. To investigate this further we develop a population synthesis\nmodel in which the Eddington ratio distribution is different for star-forming\nand quiescent host galaxies. We show that, although this model is able to\nreproduce the observed X-ray luminosity functions out to z$\\sim$2, it fails to\nsimultaneously reproduce the observed flat relationship between SFR and X-ray\nluminosity.

Assuming\nsingle-star evolution, the minimum mass of CCSNe is $7.33^{+0.02}_{-0.16}$\n$\\text{M}_\\odot$, the slope of the progenitor mass distribution is $\\alpha =\n-2.96^{+0.45}_{-0.25}$, and the maximum mass is greater than\n$\\text{M}_\\textrm{max} > 59$ $\\text{M}_\\odot$ with a 68% confidence.

The progenitor distribution is somewhat steeper than a\nSalpeter initial mass function ($\\alpha$ = -2.35). This suggests that either\nSNR catalogs are biased against the youngest SF regions, or the most massive\nstars do not explode as easily as lower mass stars. If SNR catalogs are biased,\nit will most likely affect the slope but not the minimum mass.

The\nlinear polarization of the dust emission is detected almost all along the disk\nand its properties suggest that dust polarization is produced mainly by\nself-scattering.

We argue that mass loss by radiation-driven winds mediated by\nline opacity is one of the prime candidates setting the upper-mass limit. We\npresent mass-loss predictions (dM/dt_wind) from Monte Carlo radiative transfer\nmodels for relatively cool (Teff = 15kK) inflated very massive stars (VMS) with\nlarge Eddington Gamma factors in the mass range 100-1000 Msun as a function of\nmetallicity down to 1/100 Z/Zsun. We employ a hydrodynamic version of our Monte\nCarlo method, allowing us to predict the rate of mass loss (dM/dt_wind) and the\nterminal wind velocity (vinf) simultaneously. Interestingly, we find wind\nterminal velocities (vinf) that are low (100-500 km/s) over a wide Z-range, and\nwe propose that the slow winds from VMS are an important source of\nself-enrichment in globular clusters. We also find mass-loss rates\n(dM/dt_wind), exceeding the typical mass-accretion rate (dM/dt_accr) of 0.001\nMsun/yr during massive-star formation. We express our mass-loss predictions as\na function of mass and Z, finding log dM/dt = -9.13 + 2.1 log(M/Msun) + 0.74\nlog(Z/Zsun) (Msun/yr). Even if stellar winds would not directly halt & reverse\nmass accretion during star formation, if the most massive stars form by stellar\nmergers stellar wind mass loss may dominate over the rate at which stellar\ngrowth takes place. We therefore argue that the upper-mass limit is effectively\nZ-dependent due to the nature of radiation-driven winds.

To investigate\nthe potential underlying causes we perform a comparative study of the chemistry\nof T Tauri and Herbig Ae/Be disks, using a model that pays special attention to\nphotochemistry. The warmer disk temperatures and higher ultraviolet flux of\nHerbig stars compared to T Tauri stars induce some differences in the disk\nchemistry.

In this work, we re-analyzed the ALMA 13CO (3-2) and\nC18O (3-2) data of 88 young stellar objects in Lupus with the velocity-aligned\nstacking method to enhance S/N and to study the kinematics and disk properties\ntraced by molecular lines. This method aligns spectra at different positions in\na disk based on the projected Keplerian velocities at their positions and then\nstacks them. This method enhances the S/N ratios of molecular-line data and\nallows us to obtain better detections and to constrain dynamical stellar masses\nand disk orientations. We obtain 13CO detections in 41 disks and C18O\ndetections in 18 disks with 11 new detections in 13CO and 9 new detections in\nC18O after applying the method. We estimate the disk orientations and the\ndynamical stellar masses from the 13CO data. Our estimated dynamical stellar\nmasses correlate with the spectroscopic stellar masses, and in a subsample of\n16 sources, where the inclination angles are better constrained, the two masses\nare in a good agreement within the uncertainties and with a mean difference of\n0.15 Msun. With more detections of fainter disks, our results show that high\ngas masses derived from the 13CO and C18O lines tend to be associated with high\ndust masses estimated from the continuum emission. Nevertheless, the scatter is\nlarge (0.9 dex), implying large uncertainties in deriving the disk gas mass\nfrom the line fluxes.

With the\naddition of distance information - deriving reliable ages from photometry is a\npossibility. We have developed a Bayesian method that generates 2D probability\nmaps of a star's age and metallicity from photometry and parallax using\nisochrones. Our synthetic tests show that including a near-UV passband enables\nus to break the degeneracy between a star's age and metallicity for certain\nevolutionary stages. It is possible to find well-constrained ages and\nmetallicities for turn-off and sub-giant stars with colours including a U band\nand a parallax with uncertainty less than ~20%. Metallicities alone are\npossible for the main sequence and giant branch. We find good agreement with\nthe literature when we apply our method to the Gaia benchmark stars,\nparticularly for turn-off and young stars. Further tests on the old open\ncluster NGC 188, however, reveal significant limitations in the stellar\nisochrones. The ages derived for the cluster stars vary with evolutionary\nstage, such that turn-off ages disagree with those on the sub-giant branch, and\nmetallicities vary significantly throughout. Furthermore, the parameters vary\nappreciably depending on which colour combinations are used in the derivation.\nWe identify the causes of these mismatches and show that improvements are\nneeded in the modelling of giant branch stars and in the creation and\ncalibration of synthetic near-UV photometry. Our results warn against applying\nisochrone fitting indiscriminately. In particular, the uncertainty on the\nstellar models should be quantitatively taken into account.

However, measuring accurate masses for subgiants\nand giants is far more challenging than it is for their main-sequence\ncounterparts, which has led to recent concerns regarding the veracity of the\ncorrelation between stellar mass and planet occurrence.

When reddening corrections are considered in the calculations\nof stellar masses and a -0.12 M$_{\\odot}$ offset is applied to the results, the\nmasses of the subgiants are consistent with their space velocity distributions,\ncontrary to claims in the literature.

The wavelength\ncoverage for most of the observed spectra allows for the determination of\ncarbon and {\\alpha}-element abundances, which are crucial for con- sidering the\nnature and frequency of the carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars in this\nsample. We find that 88% of the observed stars have [Fe/H] <= -1.0, 61% have\n[Fe/H] <= -2.0, and 3% have [Fe/H] <= -3.0 (with four stars at [Fe/H] <= -3.5).\nThere are 306 CEMP star candidates in this sample, and we identify 169 CEMP\nGroup I, 131 CEMP Group II, and 6 CEMP Group III stars from the A(C) vs. [Fe/H]\ndiagram. Inspection of the [alpha/C] abundance ratios reveals that five of the\nCEMP Group II stars can be classified as \"mono-enriched second-generation\"\nstars. Gaia DR1 matches were found for 734 stars, and we show that transverse\nvelocities can be used as a confirmatory selection criteria for low-metallicity\ncandidates.

The presence of dust in the neutral interstellar medium (ISM)\ndramatically changes the metal abundances that we measure. Understanding the\nmetal content in the neutral ISM, and a direct comparison between different\nenvironments, has been hampered to date because of the degeneracy to the\nobserved ISM abundances caused by the effects of metallicity, the presence of\ndust, and nucleosynthesis. Aims. We study the metal and dust content in the\nneutral ISM consistently in different environments, and assess the universality\nof recently discovered sequences of relative abundances. We also intend to\nassess the validity of [Zn/Fe] as a tracer of dust in the ISM. This has\nrecently been cast into doubt based on observations of stellar abundances, and\nneeds to be addressed before we can safely use it to study the ISM. Methods. In\nthis letter we present a simple comparison of relative abundances observed in\nthe neutral ISM in the Galaxy, the Magellanic Clouds, and damped Lyman-{\\alpha}\nAbsorbers (DLAs). The main novelty in this comparison is the inclusion of the\nMagellanic Clouds. Results. The same sequences of relative abundances are valid\nfor the Galaxy, Magellanic Clouds, and DLAs. These sequences are driven by the\npresence of dust in the ISM and seem 'universal'. Conclusions. The metal and\ndust properties in the neutral ISM appear to follow a similar behaviour in\ndifferent environments. This suggests that a dominant fraction of the dust\nbudget is built up from grain growth in the ISM depending of the physical\nconditions and regardless of the star formation history of the system. In\naddition, the DLA gas behaves like the neutral ISM, at least from a chemical\npoint of view. Finally, despite the deviations in [Zn/Fe] observed in stellar\nabundances, [Zn/Fe] is a robust dust tracer in the ISM of different\nenvironments, from the Galaxy to DLAs. \n\n"}

By investigating the OGLE light-curves of 64 B supergiants\n(Bsgs) in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) on a timescale of three years with a\ncadence of one night, the incidence of S Dor variables amongst the Bsgs\npopulation is investigated. From our sample, we find just one Bsg, AzV 261,\nthat displays the photometric behaviour characteristic of S Doradus variables.\nWe obtain and study a new VLT X-shooter spectrum of AzV 261 in order to\ninvestigate whether the object has changed its effective temperature over the\nlast decade. We do not find any effective temperature variations indicating\nthat the object is unlikely to be a LBV S Dor variable. As there is only one\nprevious bona-fide S Dor variable known to be present in the SMC (R 40), we\nfind the maximum duration of the LBV phase in the SMC to be at most $\\sim$few\n10$^3$yrs, or more likely that canonical Bsgs and S Dor LBVs are intrinsically\ndifferent objects.

Using truncations that incur errors below chemical\naccuracy, we are able to perform Trotter steps of the arbitrary basis\nelectronic structure Hamiltonian with $\\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ gate complexity in\nsmall simulations, which reduces to $\\mathcal{O}(N^2 \\log N)$ gate complexity\nin the asymptotic regime, while our unitary Coupled Cluster Trotter step has\n$\\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ gate complexity as a function of increasing basis size for a\ngiven molecule.

This\ndrop in wind velocity is much steeper than would be expected from the drop in\nescape speed for cooler stars. The results may be particularly relevant for\nslow winds inferred for some High-Mass X-ray binaries. Second, the strength of\nthe mass-loss bi-stability jump is found to be significantly larger than\npreviously assumed.

Here\nwe extend these 2D simulations to three dimensions (3D) and find that rings and\ngaps are still formed in the presence of a moderately strong ambipolar\ndiffusion. The rings and gaps form from the same basic mechanism that was\nidentified in the 2D simulations, namely, the redistribution of the poloidal\nmagnetic flux relative to the disk material as a result of the reconnection of\na sharply pinched poloidal magnetic field lines. Thus, the less dense gaps are\nmore strongly magnetized with a large poloidal magnetic field compared to the\nless magnetized (dense) rings. The rings and gaps start out rather smoothly in\n3D simulations that have axisymmetric initial conditions. Non-axisymmetric\nvariations arise spontaneously at later times, but they do not grow to such an\nextent as to disrupt the rings and gaps. These disk substructures persist to\nthe end of the simulations, lasting up to 3000 orbital periods at the inner\nedge of the simulated disk. The longevity of the perturbed yet still coherent\nrings make them attractive sites for trapping large grains that would otherwise\nbe lost to rapid radial migration due to gas drag. As the ambipolar diffusivity\ndecreases, both the disk and the wind become increasingly turbulent, driven by\nthe magnetorotational instability, with tightly-wound spiral arms becoming more\nprominent in the disk. \n\n"}

These have been routinely detected in radio\nimages, and components associated with a circumbinary disk have also been\nsuggested in optical emission lines. We wish to spatially resolve the regions\nproducing the stationary emission lines of SS 433 to shed light on its\ncircumbinary structure and outflows. With an estimated binary orbit size\n$\\lesssim 0.1 \\text{ mas}$, this requires optical interferometry. We use the\noptical interferometer VLTI+GRAVITY to spatially resolve SS 433 in the\nnear-infrared K band at high spectral resolution ($R\\approx 4000$) on three\nnights in July 2017. The stationary Br$\\gamma$ line is clearly dominated by an\nextended $\\sim 1 \\text{ mas} \\sim 5 \\text{ AU}$ circumbinary structure\nperpendicular to the jets and with a strong rotation component. The rotation\ndirection is retrograde relative to the jet precession, in accordance with the\nslaved disk precession model. The structure has a very high specific angular\nmomentum and is too extended to be a stable circumbinary disk in Keplerian\nrotation; interpreting it as such leads to a very high enclosed mass $M \\gtrsim\n400 M_{\\odot}$. We instead interpret it as the centrifugal ejection of the\ncircumbinary disk, with the implication that there must be an efficient\ntransfer of specific angular momentum from the binary to the disk. We suggest\nthat the equatorial outflows sometimes seen in radio images result from similar\nepisodes of circumbinary disk centrifugal ejection. In addition to the\nequatorial structure, we find a very extended $\\sim 6 \\text{ mas} \\sim 30\n\\text{ AU}$ spherical wind component to the Br$\\gamma$ line: the entire binary\nis engulfed in an optically thin spherical line emission envelope. \n\n"}

Constraints from Spatially Resolved\n  Optical Jets and $\\texttt{Cloudy}$ Modeling of the Optical Bullets Abstract: The microquasar SS 433 is well-known for its precessing, relativistic\nbaryonic jets. Depending on their heating mechanism, the optical jet bullets\nmay serve as a probe of the collimated radiation coming from the inner region\nclose to the compact object. The optical interferometer VLTI/GRAVITY has\nallowed to spatially resolved the optical jets in SS 433 for the first time. We\npresent here the second such observation taken over three nights in July 2017.\nIn addition, we use the multi-wavelength XSHOOTER spectrograph at VLT to study\nthe optical bullets in SS 433 in detail. GRAVITY reveals elongated\nexponential-like spatial profiles for the optical jets, suggestive of a heating\nmechanism acting throughout a long portion of the jet and naturally explained\nby photoionization by the collimated radiation. We also spatially resolve the\nmovement of the optical bullets for the first time, detecting extended jet\ncomponents corresponding to previous ejections. \\texttt{Cloudy} photoionization\nmodels explain both the spatial intensity profiles measured with GRAVITY and\nthe line ratios from XSHOOTER, and constrain the properties of the optical\nbullets and the ionizing radiation. We find that the latter must peak in the UV\nwith an isotropic luminosity (as inferred by a face on observer) $\\approx\n10^{41}$ erg/s. Provided that the X-ray SED is sufficiently hard, the\ncollimated X-ray luminosity could still be high enough so that the face on\nobserver would see SS 433 as an ULX ($L_X \\lesssim 10^{40}$ erg/s) and it would\nstill be compatible with the H/He/He+ ionization balance of the optical\nbullets. The kinetic power in the optical jets is constrained to $3-20 \\times\n10^{38}$ erg/s, and the extinction in the optical jets to $A_V = 6.7 \\pm 0.1$.\nWe suggest there may be substantial $A_V \\gtrsim 1$ and structured\ncircumstellar extinction in SS 433, likely arising from dust formed in\nequatorial outflows. \n\n"}

We evaluate the advantage of combining\nobservations with MATISSE/VLTI and ALMA to constrain the radial and vertical\nstructure of the dust in the innermost region of circumstellar discs in nearby\nstar-forming regions. Based on a disc model with a parameterized dust density\ndistribution, we apply 3D radiative-transfer simulations to obtain ideal\nintensity maps.

Within the considered parameter space, we find that constraining the dust\ndensity structure in the innermost $5\\,$au around the central star is\nchallenging with MATISSE alone, whereas ALMA observations with reasonable\nintegration times allow us to derive significant constraints on the disc\nsurface density. However, we find that the estimation of the different disc\nparameters can be considerably improved by combining MATISSE and ALMA\nobservations. For example, combining a 30-minute ALMA observation (at 310 GHz\nwith an angular resolution of 0.03$^{\\prime\\prime}$) for MATISSE observations\nin the L and M bands (with visibility accuracies of about $3\\,\\%$) allows the\nradial density slope and the dust surface density profile to be constrained to\nwithin $\\Delta \\alpha=0.3$ and $\\Delta (\\alpha-\\beta)=0.15$, respectively.

We derived accurate stellar ages for the cluster NGC6530,\nassociated with the Lagoon Nebula to infer its SF history. We use the Gaia-ESO\nsurvey observations and Gaia DR2 data, to derive cluster membership and\nfundamental stellar parameters. We identified 652 confirmed and 9 probable\nmembers. The reddening inferred for members and non-members allows us to\ndistinguish MS stars and giants, in agreement with the distances inferred from\nGaia DR2 data. The foreground and background stars show a spatial pattern that\ntraces the 3D structure of the nebular dust component. We derive stellar ages\nfor 382 confirmed cluster members and we find that the gravity-sensitive gamma\nindex distribution for M stars is correlated with stellar age. For all members\nwith Teff<5500 K, the mean logarithmic age is 5.84 (units of years) with a\ndispersion of 0.36 dex. The age distribution of stars with accretion and/or\ndisk (CTTSe) is similar to that of stars without accretion and without disk\n(WTTSp). We interpret this dispersion as evidence of a real age spread since\nthe total uncertainties on age determinations, derived from Monte Carlo\nsimulations, are significantly smaller than the observed spread. This\nconclusion is supported by the evidence of a decreasing of the\ngravity-sensitive gamma index as a function of stellar ages. The presence of\nthe age spread is also supported by the spatial distribution and the kinematics\nof old and young members. In particular, members with accretion and/or disk,\nformed in the last 1 Myr, show evidence of subclustering around the cluster\ncenter, in the Hourglass Nebula and in the M8-E region, suggesting a possible\ntriggering of star formation events by the O-type star ionization fronts. \n\n"}

Using data in the range log(delta) = -0.5 -\n1.8 and z = 1.8 - 4.1, and a renormalized version of the Haardt & Madau (2001)\nmodel for the UV background radiation from galaxies and quasars, we measure a\nmedian metallicity of [C/H] = -3.47 + 0.08(z-3) + 0.65[log(delta)-0.5] and a\nlognormal scatter of sigma([C/H]) = 0.76 + 0.02(z-3) - 0.23[log(delta)-0.5].\nThus, we find significant trends with overdensity, but no evidence for\nevolution. These measurements imply that gas in this density range accounts for\na cosmic carbon abundance of [C/H] = -2.80 +/- 0.13 (Omega_C = 2e-7), with no\nevidence for evolution. The dominant source of systematic error is the spectral\nshape of the UV background, with harder spectra yielding higher carbon\nabundances. While the systematic errors due to uncertainties in the spectral\nhardness may exceed the quoted statistical errors for delta < 10, we stress\nthat UV backgrounds that differ significantly from our fiducial model give\nunphysical results. The measured lognormal scatter is strictly independent of\nthe spectral shape, provided the background radiation is uniform. We also\npresent measurements of the C III/C IV ratio (which rule out collisional\nionization) and of the evolution of the effective Lyman-alpha optical depth. \n\n"}

We model one-halo pairwise velocities by assuming that satellite\ngalaxy velocities follow a Gaussian distribution with dispersion proportional\nto the virial dispersion of the host halo. Two-halo velocity statistics are a\ncombination of virial motions and host halo motions. The velocity distribution\nfunction (DF) of halo pairs is a complex function with skewness and kurtosis\nthat vary substantially with scale. Using a series of collisionless N-body\nsimulations, we demonstrate that the shape of this DF is determined primarily\nby the distribution of local densities around a halo pair, and at fixed density\nthe velocity DF is close to Gaussian and nearly independent of halo mass. We\ncalibrate a model for the conditional probability function of densities around\nhalo pairs on these simulations. With this model, the full shape of the halo\nvelocity DF can be accurately calculated as a function of halo mass, radial\nseparation, angle, and cosmology. The HOD approach to redshift-space\ndistortions utilizes clustering data from linear to non-linear scales to break\nthe standard degeneracies inherent in previous models of redshift-space\nclustering.

An\nemphasis is placed on techniques that are shared with the approach based on\ntruncations of the Dyson-Schwinger equations of QCD. In contrast to most other\nfield theory models for QCD degrees of freedom in hadron physics, this approach\ndirectly deals with the derived intrinsic space-time extent of the meson modes\nin their role as field variables and can accommodate confinement as well as\ndynamical breaking of chiral symmetry. Various theoretical techniques and\napproximations found useful in this approach are described. Selected\napplications reviewed here include the properties and interactions of the\nGoldstone bosons, interaction vertex functions, low energy chiral observables,\nelectromagnetic interactions and form factors, and transition form factors.\nSome initial considerations of Vector Meson Dominance and pion loop processes\nare discussed. \n\n"}

I consider $NN$ scattering in $S$-wave channels at\nmomenta well below the pion mass. In these channels (quasi-)bound states are\npresent at energies well below the scale $m_\\pi^2/M$ expected from naturalness\narguments. I ask whether, in the presence of such a shallow bound state, there\nis a regularization scheme which leads to an EFT potential that is both useful\nand systematic. In general, if a low-lying bound state is present then cutoff\nregularization leads to an EFT potential which is useful but not systematic,\nand dimensional regularization with minimal subtraction leads to one which is\nsystematic but not useful. The recently-proposed technique of dimensional\nregularization with power-law divergence subtraction allows the definition of\nan EFT potential which is both useful and systematic. \n\n"}

We study the dynamics of multi-parton systems\nproduced in nucleus-nucleus collisions at energies corresponding the the CERN\nSPS and the future BNL RHIC experiments. Due to the complexity of the\nmulti-particle dynamics we choose to employ the parton cascade model in order\nto simulate the development of multiple parton scatterings and associated\nstimulated emision processes. Our results indicate a non-linear increase with\nnuclear mass A of, e.g., parton multiplicity, energy density, strangeness, and\ncontrast a linear A-scaling as in Glauber-type approaches. If multiple\ninteractions are suppressed and only single parton scatterings (no\nre-interactions) are considered, we recover such a linear behavior. It remains\nto be studied whether these results on the parton level can be experimentally\nseen in final-state observables, such as the charged particle multiplicity, the\nmagnitude of produced transverse energy, or the number of produced strange\nhadrons. \n\n"}

Large sensitivity on the nucleon strangeness are found in several\nbeam-target and beam-recoil double polarization observables.
