The\nintracluster helium abundance cannot be measured directly. This presents a\nsignificant source of uncertainty for cosmological tests based on the X-ray\nderived cluster quantities, such as the gas mass, total mass, and gas mass\nfraction, all of which depend on the assumed helium abundance.

In particular, the main\ncontribution to the electric-like transition form factor comes from the\nwave-function corrections, which is a consequence of the generalized\nAdemollo-Gatto theorem derived in the present work.

The surface\narray is fully efficient above $3 \\times 10^{18}$ eV and, even if the hybrid\nmode can extend this range below $10^{18}$ eV, the second knee and a\nconsiderable portion of the wide ankle structure are left outside its operating\nrange.

This is in\nqualitative agreement with computer models which predict that variations in\nradioactive nickel yield have less impact on the rise than on the spread of the\ndecline rates. The differences we find in the rise and fall properties suggest\nthat a single 'stretch' correction to the light curve phase does not properly\nmodel the range of SN Ia light curve shapes. We select a subset of 105 light\ncurves well-observed in both rise and fall portions of the light curves and\ndevelop a '2-stretch' fit algorithm which estimates the rise and fall times\nindependently. We find the average time from explosion to B-band peak\nbrightness is 17.38 +/- 0.17 days.

At higher $D$ the tensor\ngravitons emission is dominant, so that the overall lifetime of black holes\nwith Gauss-Bonnet corrections is many orders larger than was expected. This\neffect should be relevant for the future experiments at the Large Hadron\nCollider (LHC). Keywords: Hawking radiation, black hole evaporation. \n\n"}

However, it has been shown on statistical\ngrounds that a third, intermediate population is needed in this classification\nscheme, although an extensive study of the properties of this class has so far\nnot been done. The large amount of follow-up studies generated during the Swift\nera allows us to have a suficient sample to attempt a study of this third\npopulation through the properties of their prompt emission and their\nafterglows. Our study is focused on a sample of GRBs observed by Swift during\nits first four years of operation. The sample contains those bursts with\nmeasured redshift since this allows us to derive intrinsic properties.\nIntermediate bursts are less energetic and have dimmer afterglows than long\nGRBs, especially when considering the X-ray light curves, which are on average\none order of magnitude fainter than long bursts. There is a less significant\ntrend in the redshift distribution that places intermediate bursts closer than\nlong bursts. Except for this, intermediate bursts show similar properties to\nlong bursts. In particular, they follow the Epeak vs. Eiso correlation and\nhave, on average, positive spectral lags with a distribution similar to that of\nlong bursts.

This study\nshows that intermediate bursts are different from short bursts and, in spite of\nsharing many properties with long bursts, there are some differences between\nthem as well. We suggest that the physical difference between intermediate and\nlong bursts could be that for the first the ejecta are thin shells while for\nthe latter they are thick shells. \n\n"}

In this energy regime the effective break-up cross\nsection for a c-cbar dipole depends on energy and nuclear path length, and\nagrees well with data from fixed target experiments, both in magnitude and\nenergy dependence. At higher energies of RHIC and LHC coherence in c-cbar pair\nproduction leads to charm quark shadowing which is a complement to the high\ntwist break up cross section. These two effects explain well with no adjusted\nparameters the magnitude and rapidity dependence of nuclear suppression of\nJ/Psi observed at RHIC in dAu collisions, while the contribution of leading\ntwist gluon shadowing is found to be vanishingly small. A novel mechanism of\ndouble color filtering for c-cbar dipoles makes nuclei significantly more\ntransparent in AA compared to pA collisions.

In the test-mass limit,\nwell-defined ISCO conditions exist for the Kerr and Schwarzschild spacetimes.\nIn the finite-mass case, there are a large variety of ways to define an ISCO in\na post-Newtonian (PN) context. Here I generalize the gauge-invariant ISCO\ncondition of Blanchet & Iyer (2003) to the case of spinning (nonprecessing)\nbinaries. The Blanchet-Iyer ISCO condition has two desirable and unexpected\nproperties: (1) it exactly reproduces the Schwarzschild ISCO in the test-mass\nlimit, and (2) it accurately approximates the recently-calculated shift in the\nSchwarzschild ISCO frequency due to the conservative-piece of the gravitational\nself-force [Barack & Sago (2009)]. The generalization of this ISCO condition to\nspinning binaries has the property that it also exactly reproduces the Kerr\nISCO in the test-mass limit (up to the order at which PN spin corrections are\ncurrently known). The shift in the ISCO due to the spin of the test-particle is\nalso calculated. Remarkably, the gauge-invariant PN ISCO condition exactly\nreproduces the ISCO shift predicted by the Papapetrou equations for a\nfully-relativistic spinning particle. It is surprising that an analysis of the\nstability of the standard PN equations of motion is able (without any form of\n\"resummation\") to accurately describe strong-field effects of the Kerr\nspacetime. The ISCO frequency shift due to the conservative self-force in Kerr\nis also calculated from this new ISCO condition, as well as from the\neffective-one-body Hamiltonian of Barausse & Buonanno (2010). These results\nserve as a useful point-of-comparison for future gravitational self-force\ncalculations in the Kerr spacetime. \n\n"}

In anticipation of the first detections, the\nexpected distribution of GW sources in the local universe is of considerable\ninterest.

Such a high T_R\nvalue typically leads to an overproduction of gravitinos in the early universe,\nwhich will cause conflicts, mainly with BBN constraints.

We calculate the relic\nabundance of mixed axion/axino dark matter in the AY scenario, and investigate\nunder what conditions a value of T_R sufficient for thermal leptogenesis can be\ngenerated. A high value of PQ breaking scale f_a is needed to suppress\noverproduction of axinos, while a small vacuum misalignment angle \\theta_i is\nneeded to suppress overproduction of axions.

Wavelets allow us to reformulate the RM synthesis method in a\nscale-dependent way and to visualize the data as a function of Faraday depth\nand scale. We present observational tests to recognize magnetic field\nstructures. A region with a regular magnetic field generates a broad \"disk\" in\nFaraday space (\"Faraday spectrum\"), with two \"horns\" when the distribution of\ncosmic-ray electrons is broader than that of the thermal electrons. Each\nmagnetic field reversal generates one asymmetric \"horn\" on top of the \"disk\". A\nregion with a turbulent field can be recognized as a \"Faraday forest\" of many\ncomponents. These tests are applied to the spectral ranges of various synthesis\nradio telescopes. We argue that the ratio of maximum to minimum wavelengths\ndetermines the range of scales that can be identified in Faraday space.

The source has been observed 9\ntimes by Chandra and once by XMM from 2000 to 2007. Long term variability is\nclearly detected, between the observations, in the 2-10 keV flux varying by a\nfactor of three (~3-9x10^-14 erg s^-1 cm^-2) and in the amount of neutral\nabsorption (Nh < 10^22 cm^-2 in 2000 and 2002 and Nh=4.4+-1.2x10^22 cm^-2 in\n2007).

In the XMM observation of\n2002, strongly affected by background flares, there is a hint for a similar\nfeature at 8.0+-0.3 keV.

In this\nscenario, the outflow velocities inferred are in the range v=0.12-0.59c.

The gas in\nthese galaxies is not in perfect hydrostatic equilibrium. Supernova feedback,\nstellar winds, or active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback can significantly\nperturb the interstellar medium (ISM). Using hydrodynamical simulations, we\ninvestigate the effect of subsonic turbulence in the hot ISM on the ram\npressure stripping process in early-type galaxies. We find that galaxies with\nmore turbulent ISM produce longer, wider, and more smoothly distributed tails\nof the stripped ISM than those characterised by weaker ISM turbulence. Our main\nconclusion is that even very weak internal turbulence, at the level of <15% of\nthe average ISM sound speed, can significantly accelerate the gas removal from\ngalaxies via ram pressure stripping. The magnitude of this effect increases\nsharply with the strength of turbulence. As most of the gas stripping takes\nplace near the boundary between the ISM and the intraclustermedium (ICM), the\nboost in the ISM stripping rate is due to the \"random walk\" of the ISM from the\ncentral regions of the galactic potential well to larger distances, where the\nram pressure is able to permanently remove the gas from galaxies. The ICM can\nbe temporarily trapped inside the galactic potential well due to the mixing of\nthe turbulent ISM with the ICM.

Here we demonstrate that the scattering effects at lower\nradio frequencies are less than previously thought, and that the bursts could\nbe detectable at redshifts out to about $z=0.5$ in surveys below 1 GHz. Using a\nsource model in which the bursts are standard candles with bolometric\nluminosities $\\sim 8 \\times 10^{44}$ ergs/s uniformly distributed per unit\ncomoving volume, we derive an expression for the observed peak flux density as\na function of redshift and use this, together with the rate estimates found by\nThornton et al. to find an empirical relationship between event rate and\nredshift probed by a given survey. The non-detection of any such events in\nArecibo 1.4 GHz survey data by Deneva et al., and the Allen Telescope Array\nsurvey by Simeon et al. is consistent with our model.

If the DM abundance is due to a dark\nparticle-antiparticle asymmetry, the DM annihilation cross-section can be\narbitrarily large, and the coupling of DM to the light species can be\nsignificant. We consider the case of asymmetric DM interacting via a light (but\nnot necessarily massless) Abelian gauge vector boson, a dark photon. In the\nmassless dark photon limit, gauge invariance mandates that DM be\nmulticomponent, consisting of positive and negative dark ions of different\nspecies which partially bind in neutral dark atoms. We argue that a similar\nconclusion holds for light dark photons; in particular, we establish that the\nmulti-component and atomic character of DM persists in much of the parameter\nspace where the dark photon is sufficiently light to mediate sizeable DM\nself-interactions. We discuss the cosmological sequence of events in this\nscenario, including the dark asymmetry generation, the freeze-out of\nannihilations, the dark recombination and the phase transition which gives mass\nto the dark photon. We estimate the effect of self-interactions in DM haloes,\ntaking into account this cosmological history. We place constraints based on\nthe observed ellipticity of large haloes, and identify the regimes where DM\nself-scattering can affect the dynamics of smaller haloes, bringing theory in\nbetter agreement with observations.

The most\ninteresting one is the so-called rho-state, whose light curve shows recurrent\nbursts. This paper presents a model based on Fitzhugh-Nagumo equations\ncontaining two variables: x, linked to the source photon luminosity L detected\nby the MECS, and y related to the mean photon energy. We aim at providing a\nsimple mathematical framework composed by non-linear differential equations\nuseful to predict the observed light curve and the energy lags for the\nrho-state and possibly other classes of the source. We studied the equilibrium\nstate and the stability conditions of this system that includes one external\nparameter, J, that can be considered a function of the disk accretion rate. Our\nwork is based on observations performed with the MECS on board BeppoSAX when\nthe source was in rho and nu mode, respectively. The evolution of the mean\ncount rate and photon energy were derived from a study of the trajectories in\nthe count rate - photon energy plane. Assuming J constant, we found a solution\nthat reproduces the x profile of the rho class bursts and, unexpectedly, we\nfound that y exhibited a time modulation similar to that of the mean energy.\nMoreover, assuming a slowly modulated J the solutions for x quite similar to\nthose observed in the nu class light curves is reproduced. According these\nresults, the outer mass accretion rate is probably responsible for the state\ntransitions, but within the rho-class it is constant. This finding makes\nstronger the heuristic meaning of the non-linear model and suggests a simple\nrelation between the variable x and y. However, how a system of dynamical\nequations can be derived from the complex mathematical apparatus of accretion\ndisks remains to be furtherly explored. \n\n"}

Here we show that for large\ngrains (size >0.1 micron, containing most grain mass) in sufficiently large\nmolecular clouds (radii >1-10 pc, masses >10^4 M_sun), this scale becomes\nlarger than the characteristic sizes of pre-stellar cores (the sonic length),\nso large fluctuations in the dust-to-gas ratio are imprinted on cores.

We\ndescribe here a new method using time-delay lensed quasars where one or several\nimages are affected by microlensing due to stars in the lensing galaxy. Because\nmicrolensing decreases (or increases) the flux of the continuum compared to the\nbroad line region, it changes the contrast between these two emission\ncomponents. We show that this effect can be used to effectively disentangle the\nintrinsic variability of those two regions, offering the opportunity to perform\nreverberation mapping based on single band photometric data. Based on simulated\nlight curves generated using a damped random walk model of quasar variability,\nwe show that measurement of the size of the broad line region can be achieved\nusing this method, provided one spectrum has been obtained independently during\nthe monitoring. This method is complementary to photometric reverberation\nmapping and could also be extended to multi-band data. Because the effect\ndescribed above produces a variability pattern in difference light curves\nbetween pairs of lensed images which is correlated with the time-lagged\ncontinuum variability, it can potentially produce systematic errors in\nmeasurement of time delays between pairs of lensed images. Simple simulations\nindicate that time-delay measurement techniques which use a sufficiently\nflexible model for the extrinsic variability are not affected by this effect\nand produce accurate time delays. \n\n"}

A conceptual issue with lattice\nQCD is a conflict of space-time lattice with chiral symmetry of quarks. We\ndiscuss how this problem is resolved.

The DFS model is a natural\nextension of the two-Higgs doublet model endowed with a Peccei-Quinn symmetry\nand leading to a physically acceptable axion. For generic couplings, the model\nreproduces the minimal Standard Model showing only tiny deviations (extreme\ndecoupling scenario) whereas all additional degrees of freedom (with the\nexception of the axion) are very heavy.

In this work in the framework of the Next-to-Minimal\nSupersymmetric Standard Model we focus on vector boson fusion and\nHiggs-strahlung production of heavier scalars that subsequently decay into\npairs of light pseudoscalars. We demonstrate that although these channels have\nin general very limited reach, they are viable for the detection of light\npseudoscalars in some parts of parameter space and can serve as an important\ncomplementary probe to the dominant gluon-fusion production mode. We also\ndemonstrate that in a Higgsfactory these channels may reach sensitivities\ncomparable to or even exceeding the gluon fusion channels at the LHC, thus\npossibly rendering this our best option to discover a light pseudoscalar. It is\nalso worth mentioning that for the singlet dominated scalar this may be the\nonly way to measure its couplings to gauge bosons. Especially promising are\nchannels where the initial scalar is radiated off a W as these events have\nrelatively high rates and provide substantial background suppression due to\nleptons from the W. We identify three benchmark points that well represent the\nabove scenarios. Assuming that the masses of the scalars and pseudoscalars are\nalready measured in the gluon-fusion channel, the event kinematics can be\nfurther constrained, hence significantly improving detection prospects. This is\nespecially important in the Higgs-strahlung channels with rather heavy scalars,\nand results in possible detection at 200/fb for the most favoured parts of the\nparameter space. \n\n"}

The composition of CRs coming to the solar system can be\nmeasured directly and has been used to infer the details of CR propagation that\nare extrapolated to the whole Galaxy.

In this article we use 73 months of data from\nthe Fermi Large Area Telescope in the energy range between 300 MeV and 10 GeV\nto search for gamma-ray emission produced by CR interactions in several high-\nand intermediate-velocity clouds located at up to ~ 7 kpc above the Galactic\nplane.

From these considerations it follows that one is unable to prove,\nespecially model-independently,a discovery of a DM particle with an\naccelerator, or collider. One can only obtain evidence on existence of a weakly\ninteracting neutral particle, which could be, or could not be the DM candidate.\nThe current LHC DM search program uses only the missing transverse energy\nsignature.

Applying an external\nmagnetic field of sufficiently high intensity (in the range of 0.5-1 Tesla for\noperating pressures in the range of 5-15 atmospheres) causes the electrons to\nproduce helical tracks. Assuming the tracks can be properly reconstructed, the\nsign (direction) of curvature can be determined at several points along these\ntracks, and such information can be used to separate signal (0nbb) events\ncontaining two electrons producing a track with two different directions of\ncurvature from background (single-electron) events producing a track that\nshould spiral in a single direction.

This ``sensitivity bias''\nimplies that a complete census of TTV systems is likely to yield a more robust\nestimate of the mass-radius distribution provided there are not important\nphysical differences between planets near and far from mean-motion resonance.\nWe discuss differences in the sensitivity of the two methods with orbital\nperiod and system architecture, which may compound the discrepancies between\nthem (e.g., short period planets detectable by RVs may be more dense due to\natmospheric loss). We advocate for continued mass measurements using both\napproaches as a means both to measure the masses of more planets and to\nidentify potential differences in planet structure that may result from their\ndynamical and environmental histories. \n\n"}

The prospects for\ndiscovering (and measuring) supersymmetry during future runs of the LHC are\ndiscussed in the frameworks of the constrained MSSM (CMSSM), models with\nnon-universal soft supersymmetry-breaking contributions to Higgs masses\n(NUHM1,2) and the phenomenological MSSM with 10 arbitrary soft\nsupersymmetry-breaking parameters (pMSSM10).

We consider the case of surveys for high-redshift\nLyman-alpha-emitting galaxies (LAEs), which have traditionally been classified\nvia an inferred rest-frame equivalent width (EW) greater than 20 angstrom. Our\nBayesian method relies on known prior probabilities in measured emission-line\nluminosity functions and equivalent width distributions for the galaxy\npopulations, and returns the probability that an object in question is an LAE\ngiven the characteristics observed. This approach will be directly relevant for\nthe Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX), which seeks to\nclassify ~10^6 emission-line galaxies into LAEs and low-redshift [O II]\nemitters. For a simulated HETDEX catalog with realistic measurement noise, our\nBayesian method recovers 86% of LAEs missed by the traditional EW > 20 angstrom\ncutoff over 2 < z < 3, outperforming the EW cut in both contamination and\nincompleteness. This is due to the method's ability to trade off between the\ntwo types of binary classification error by adjusting the stringency of the\nprobability requirement for classifying an observed object as an LAE. In our\nsimulations of HETDEX, this method reduces the uncertainty in cosmological\ndistance measurements by 14% with respect to the EW cut, equivalent to\nrecovering 29% more cosmological information. Rather than using binary object\nlabels, this method enables the use of classification probabilities in\nlarge-scale structure analyses.

Stability of new fermion or scalar multiplets is\nensured by an accidental matter parity that survives the spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking of the gauge group by scalar triplets. The relic abundance of these\nparticles is set by gauge interactions and gives rise to dark matter candidates\nwith masses above the electroweak scale. Dark matter annihilations are thus\nmodified by the Sommerfeld effect, not only in the early Universe, but also\ntoday, for instance, in the Center of the Galaxy. Majorana candidates -\ntriplet, quintuplet, bi-doublet, and bi-triplet - bring only one new parameter\nto the model, their mass, and are hence highly testable at colliders and\nthrough astrophysical observations. Scalar candidates - doublet and 7-plet, the\nlatter being only stable at the renormalizable level - have additional\nscalar-scalar interactions that give rise to rich phenomenology. The particles\nunder discussion share many features with the well-known candidates wino,\nHiggsino, inert doublet scalar, sneutrino, and Minimal Dark Matter.

Because of its optimal properties, one of the\nmost popular and widely-used detection technique is the matched filter (MF).\nThis is a linear filter designed to maximise the detectability of a signal of\nknown structure that is buried in additive Gaussian random noise. In this work\nwe show that in the very common situation where the number and position of the\nsearched signals within a data sequence (e.g. an emission line in a spectrum)\nor an image (e.g. a point-source in an interferometric map) are unknown, this\ntechnique, when applied in its standard form, may severely underestimate the\nprobability of false detection.

Here we aim at obtaining comprehensive and\nreliable star, galaxy and quasar catalogues based on automatic source\nclassification in full-sky WISE data. This means that the final classification\nwill employ only parameters available from WISE itself, in particular those\nreliably measured for a majority of sources.

By calibrating the classifier\non the test data drawn from SDSS, we first established that a polynomial kernel\nis preferred over a radial one for this particular dataset. Next, using three\nclassification parameters (W1 magnitude, W1-W2 colour, and a differential\naperture magnitude) we obtained very good classification efficiency in all the\ntests.

Including the\nmagnetic braking caused by the coupling between the magnetic field and an\nirradiation-driven wind induced by the X-ray flux from the accreting component,\nwe show that intermediate-mass X-ray binaries (IMXBs) can evolve into UCXBs.\nUsing the \\emph{MESA} code, we have calculated evolutionary sequences for a\nlarge number of IMXBs.

However, if the viscosity fluctuates around a mean\nvalue, one would expect the viscous time scale also to spread around a mean\nvalue. In HMXBs, the size of the viscous Keplerian disk is smaller & thus such\na spread could be lower as compared to the LMXBs. If there is an increasing or\ndecreasing trend in viscosity, the interval between enhanced emission would be\nmodified systematically. In the absence of a full knowledge about the variation\nof mass supply rates at the outer edge, we study ideal circumstances where\nmodulation must take place exactly in orbital time scales when there is an\nellipticity in the orbit. We study a few compact binaries using long term\nRXTE/ASM(1.5-12 keV) & Swift/BAT(15-50keV) data to look for such effects & to\ninfer what these results can tell us about the viscous processes inside the\nrespective disks.

Due to the presence\nof strong magnetic fields the particles' transverse motion is quantized into\nLandau levels, and the surface tension has a different value in the parallel\nand transverse directions with respect to the magnetic field.\n  We calculate the transverse and longitudinal surface tension for different\nvalues of the magnetic field and for quark matter drops with different sizes,\nfrom a few fm to the bulk limit. For baryon number densities between $2-10$\ntimes the nuclear saturation density, the surface tension falls in the range $2\n- 20$ MeV /fm$^{2}$. The largest contribution comes from strange quarks which\nhave a surface tension an order of magnitude larger than the one for $u$ or $d$\nquarks and more than two orders of magnitude larger than for electrons.

We demonstrate that this bound results\nin limits to the density-dependent symmetry energy, which is the difference\nbetween the energies of symmetric nuclear matter and PNM. In particular, this\nbound leads to a lower limit to the volume symmetry energy parameter $S_0$. In\naddition, for assumed values of $S_0$ above this minimum, this bound implies\nboth upper and lower limits to the symmetry energy slope parameter $L$, which\ndescribes the lowest-order density dependence of the symmetry energy. A lower\nbound on the neutron-matter incompressibility is also obtained. These bounds\nare found to be consistent with both recent calculations of the energies of PNM\nand constraints from nuclear experiments. Our results are significant because\nseveral equations of state that are currently used in astrophysical simulations\nof supernovae and neutron star mergers, as well as in nuclear physics\nsimulations of heavy-ion collisions, have symmetry energy parameters that\nviolate these bounds.

This particle (denoted\nhere by $H_3$) is weakly mixed with the Standard Model Higgs field ($h$) with\nmixing $\\theta_1\\lesssim m_{H_3}/m_h$, barring fine-tuned cancellation. In the\nspecific case when the $B-L$ symmetry is embedded into the TeV scale left-right\nseesaw scenario, we show that the bounds on the $h-H_3$ mixing $\\theta_1$\nbecome further strengthened due to low energy flavor constraints, thus forcing\nthe light $H_3$ to be long lived, with displaced vertex signals at the LHC. The\nproperty of left-right TeV scale seesaw models are such that they make the\n$H_3$ decay to two photons as the dominant mode. This is in contrast with a\ngeneric light scalar that mixes with the SM Higgs boson, which could also have\nleptonic and hadronic decay modes with comparable or larger strength.

In\ncontrast to the original design [Priede et al., Meas. Sci.

Dark matter in the local galactic halo,\ngravitationally accelerated to over half the speed of light, scatters against\nand deposits kinetic energy into neutron stars, heating them to infrared\nblackbody temperatures. The resulting radiation could potentially be detected\nby the James Webb Space Telescope, the Thirty Meter Telescope, or the European\nExtremely Large Telescope. This mechanism also produces optical emission from\nneutron stars in the galactic bulge, and X-ray emission near the galactic\ncenter, because dark matter is denser in these regions. For GeV - PeV mass dark\nmatter, dark kinetic heating would initially unmask any spin-independent or\nspin-dependent dark matter-nucleon cross-sections exceeding $2 \\times 10^{-45}$\ncm$^2$, with improved sensitivity after more telescope exposure. For\nlighter-than-GeV dark matter, cross-section sensitivity scales inversely with\ndark matter mass because of Pauli blocking; for heavier-than-PeV dark matter,\nit scales linearly with mass as a result of needing multiple scatters for\ncapture. Future observations of dark sector-warmed neutron stars could\ndetermine whether dark matter annihilates in or only kinetically heats neutron\nstars.

At the bright end\nof r<20, where very complete spectroscopic data overlapping with KiDS are\navailable, the performance of the ML photo-zs clearly surpasses that of BPZ,\ncurrently the primary photo-z method for KiDS.\n  Using the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) spectroscopic survey as\ncalibration, we furthermore study how photo-zs improve for bright sources when\nphotometric parameters additional to magnitudes are included in the photo-z\nderivation, as well as when VIKING and WISE infrared bands are added. While the\nfiducial four-band ugri setup gives a photo-z bias $\\delta z=-2e-4$ and scatter\n$\\sigma_z<0.022$ at mean z = 0.23, combining magnitudes, colours, and galaxy\nsizes reduces the scatter by ~7% and the bias by an order of magnitude. Once\nthe ugri and IR magnitudes are joined into 12-band photometry spanning up to 12\n$\\mu$, the scatter decreases by more than 10% over the fiducial case. Finally,\nusing the 12 bands together with optical colours and linear sizes gives $\\delta\nz<4e-5$ and $\\sigma_z<0.019$.\n  This paper also serves as a reference for two public photo-z catalogues\naccompanying KiDS DR3, both obtained using the ANNz2 code. The first one, of\ngeneral purpose, includes all the 39 million KiDS sources with four-band ugri\nmeasurements in DR3. The second dataset, optimized for low-redshift studies\nsuch as galaxy-galaxy lensing, is limited to r<20, and provides photo-zs of\nmuch better quality than in the full-depth case thanks to incorporating optical\nmagnitudes, colours, and sizes in the GAMA-calibrated photo-z derivation. \n\n"}

The\ngravitational wave source GW170817 arose from a binary neutron star merger in\nthe nearby Universe with a relatively well confined sky position and distance\nestimate. Here we report observations and physical modelling of a rapidly\nfading electromagnetic transient in the galaxy NGC4993, which is spatially\ncoincident with GW170817 and a weak short gamma-ray burst. The transient has\nphysical parameters broadly matching the theoretical predictions of blue\nkilonovae from neutron star mergers. The emitted electromagnetic radiation can\nbe explained with an ejected mass of 0.04 +/- 0.01 Msol, with an opacity of\nkappa <= 0.5 cm2/gm at a velocity of 0.2 +/- 0.1c. The power source is\nconstrained to have a power law slope of beta = -1.2 +/- 0.3, consistent with\nradioactive powering from r-process nuclides. We identify line features in the\nspectra that are consistent with light r-process elements (90 < A < 140).

Typically a simulation environment\n(software-in-the-loop, SiL) accompanies real-world test drives to\nsystematically vary environmental parameters. A missing piece in the optical\nmodel of those SiL simulations is the sharpness, given in linear system theory\nby the point-spread function (PSF) of the optical system. We present a novel\nnumerical model for the PSF of an optical system that can efficiently model\nboth experimental measurements and lens design simulations of the PSF. The\nnumerical basis for this model is a non-linear regression of the PSF with an\nartificial neural network (ANN). The novelty lies in the portability and the\nparameterization of this model, which allows to apply this model in basically\nany conceivable optical simulation scenario, e.g. inserting a measured lens\ninto a computer game to train autonomous vehicles. We present a lens\nmeasurement series, yielding a numerical function for the PSF that depends only\non the parameters defocus, field and azimuth.

The X-ray spectra are well described\nby a blackbody and a hard power-law tail. After an initial rapid decline during\nthe first day of the outburst, we observe the blackbody temperature rising from\nkT = 0.9 keV to 1.05 keV during the first two weeks of the outburst, before\ncooling to 0.9 keV. During this time, the blackbody radius decreases\nmonotonically by a factor of ~4 over a span of nearly 200 days.

Abstract: Quark-hadron continuity was proposed as crossover between hadronic matter and\nquark matter without a phase transition, based on the matching of the symmetry\nand excitations in both phases. In the limit of a light strange-quark mass, it\nconnects hyperon matter and the color-flavor-locked (CFL) phase exhibiting\ncolor superconductivity. Recently, it was proposed that this conjecture could\nbe generalized in the presence of superfluid vortices penetrating both phases\n(arXiv:1803.05115 [hep-ph]), and it was suggested that one hadronic superfluid\nvortex in hyperon matter could be connected to one non-Abelian vortex (color\nmagnetic flux tube) in the CFL phase. Here, we argue that their proposal is\nconsistent only at large distances; instead, we show that three hadronic\nsuperfluid vortices must combine with three non-Abelian vortices with different\ncolors with the total color magnetic fluxes canceled out, where the junction is\ncalled a colorful boojum.

The first gravitational-wave event GW170817 from a binary compact star\nmerger observed by the LIGO/VIRGO detectors have already put limits on the\ntidal deformability and provided constraints on the ultra-high nuclear density\nEOS. In view of this ground breaking discovery, we revisit and extend our\nprevious work [Phys. Rev. D 95, 101302(R) (2017)] which found that taking the\neffect of elasticity into account in the calculation of the tidal deformability\nof compact star models composed of crystalline color-superconducting (CCS)\nquark matter can break the universal I-Love relation discovered for fluid\ncompact stars. In this paper, we present our formulation in detail and provide\nmore analysis to complement our previous findings. We focus and extend the\nstudy of the screening effect on the tidal deformability, which we found\npreviously for hybrid star models, to various theoretical two-layer compact\nstar models. We show that the screening effect of these two-layer models in\ngeneral depends on the thickness of the envelope and the ratio between the\ndensity gap and the core density at the core-envelope interface. However, for\nmodels with a fluid envelope and a vanishing small density gap, the screening\neffect remains strong even as the thickness of the envelops tends to zero if\nthe quark matter core has a fairly uniform density. The relevance of our study\nto GW170817 is also discussed. Our study advocates that the tidal deformability\nnot only provides us information on the EOS, but may also give insights into\nthe multi-layer structure and elastic properties of compact star models\ncomposed of CCS quark matter. \n\n"}

{"id": "1810.07270", "contents": "Title: Explanation of Detailed Spectral Properties of FRBs by Axion Star Model Abstract: We have proposed a generation mechanism of non repeating ( repeating ) fast\nradio bursts: They arise by axion star collisions with neutron stars (\naccretion disks of galactic black holes ). The axion star as coherent state of\naxions with mass $m_a$ generates homogeneous electric field oscillating with\nfrequency $m_a/2\\pi$ under strong magnetic fields. The field makes electrons\ncoherently oscillate and emit the coherent dipole radiations ( FRBs ). The\nradiations stop when thermal fluctuations produced by the oscillation disturb\nthe coherent oscillations. Thus, the duration of the FRBs is determined by the\ntime scale of the thermalization; it is much shorter than $1$ms. Line spectra\nof the dipole radiations are broadened by the thermal effects. The thermally\nbroaden spectra have a feature that the bandwidths $\\delta\\nu$ are proportional\nto their center frequencies $\\nu_c$. The presence of various center frequencies\n( $1.2$GHz$\\sim $$7$GHz ) in repeating FRB 121102 is attributed to Doppler\nshifts owing to the various relativistic velocities of the accretion disk. On\nthe other hand, non repeating FRBs do not show such variety of the center\nfrequencies. They come from the surfaces of neutron stars. The Doppler shift\nalso makes the durations of the bursts with higher frequencies become shorter.\nBecause the magnetic fields of the neutron stars are supposed to be stronger\nthan those of the accretion disks, the peak flux densities of non repeating\nFRBs are larger than those of repeating FRB 121102. The strong magnetic fields\nof the neutron stars also lead to much wide bandwidths of non repeating FRBs,\nwhich are over the extent of the receiver frequency range.

If\nthese BBHs are the product of binary evolution, then PPISNe could occur in very\nclose binaries. Motivated by this, we discuss the implications of a PPISN\nhappening with a close binary companion, and what impact these events have on\nthe formation of merging BBHs through binary evolution.

To\nmeet the physics goals, the vertex and tracking detectors require not only a\nspatial resolution of a few micrometers and a very low material budget, but\nalso timing capabilities with a precision of a few nanoseconds to allow\nsuppression of beam-induced backgrounds.\n  Different technologies using hybrid silicon detectors are explored for the\nvertex detectors, such as dedicated readout ASICs, small-pitch active edge\nsensors as well as capacitively coupled High-Voltage CMOS sensors.

However, this is not the\ncase if the field is time-dependent. Electronic orbitals in atoms either shield\nthe nucleus from an oscillating electric field when the frequency of the field\nis off the atomic resonances or enhance this field when its frequency\napproaches an atomic transition energy. In molecules, not only electronic, but\nalso rotational and vibrational states are responsible for the screening of\noscillating electric fields.

It has been suggested that fossil relativistic\nelectrons contained in remnant bubbles from extinct radio galaxies can be\nre-accelerated to radio-emitting energies by merger-driven shocks via diffusive\nshock acceleration (DSA), leading to the birth of radio relics detected in\nclusters. In this study we assume that such bubble consist primarily of thermal\ngas entrained from the surrounding medium and dynamically-insignificant amounts\nof relativistic electrons. We also consider several realistic models for\nmagnetic fields in the cluster outskirts, including the ICM field that scales\nwith the gas density as $B_{\\rm ICM}\\propto n_{\\rm ICM}^{0.5}$. Then we perform\ntime-dependent DSA simulations of a spherical shock that runs into a\nlower-density but higher-temperature bubble with the ratio $n_{\\rm b}/n_{\\rm\nICM} \\approx T_{\\rm ICM}/T_{\\rm b}\\approx 0.5$.

In the Dyson-Schwinger\napproach the infrared behaviour of these propagators is determined\nanalytically.

In type II see-saw mechanism with dominance of the\nnon-canonical SU(2)_L triplet term, the conventional see-saw term can give a\nsmall contribution to the neutrino mass matrix. If the triplet term corresponds\nto the bimaximal mixing scheme in the normal hierarchy, the small contribution\nof the conventional see-saw term naturally generates non-maximal solar neutrino\nmixing.

According\nto the prevailing understanding of cosmic string dynamics in an expanding\nUniverse, the network of long strings loses its energy first into string loops,\nwhich in turn give off most of their energy as gravitational radiation.\nHowever, it has been suggested by Vincent et al. (VHS) that particle emission\nmay be the dominant energy loss channel for the long string network. In this\ncase, the predicted flux of high energy particles would be much larger. Here we\ncalculate the predicted flux of high energy gamma rays, neutrinos and cosmic\nray antiprotons and protons as a function of the scale of symmetry breaking at\nwhich the strings are produced and as a function of the initial energy m_J of\nthe particle jets which result from the string decay. Assuming the validity of\nthe VHS scenario, we find that due to the interactions with the cosmic\nradiation backgrounds all fluxes but the neutrino flux are suppressed at the\nhighest energies. This indicates that the observed events above the GZK cutoff\ncan only be accounted for in this scenario if the primary particle is a\nneutrino and the scale of the symmetry breaking is somewhat less than the GUT\nscale.

The determinant\nrepresents a version of the isomonodromic $\\tau$-function, itroduced by M.\nSato, T. Miwa and M. Jimbo. It is calculated by comparison of two sections of\nthe $\\mathrm{det}^*$-bundle over an infinite-dimensional grassmannian. The\nlatter is composed of the spaces of boundary values of some local solutions to\nDirac equation. The principal ingredients of the computation are the formulae\nfor the Green function of the singular Dirac operator and for the so-called\ncanonical basis of global solutions on the 1-punctured cylinder. We also derive\na set of deformation equations satisfied by the expansion coefficients of the\ncanonical basis in the general case and find a more explicit expression for the\n$\\tau$-function in the simplest case $n=2$. \n\n"}

In the case where the\neffective sigma model is on a maximally split non--compact coset U/H (maximal\nsupergravity or subsectors of lower supersymmetry supergravities) we are also\nable to construct a completely explicit analytic integration algorithm,\nadapting a method introduced by Kodama et al in a recent paper. The properties\nof the general integral are particularly suggestive. Initial data are\nrepresented by a pair C_0, h_0 where C_0 is in the CSA of the Lie algebra of U\nand h_0 in H/W is in the compact subgroup H modded by the Weyl group of U. At\nasymptotically early and asymptotically late times the Lax operator is always\nin the Cartan subalgebra and due to the iso-spectral property the two limits\ndiffer only by the action of some element of the Weyl group.

{"id": "hep-th/9412155", "contents": "Title: Anisotropic Asymptotics and High Energy Scattering Abstract: Recently E.Verlinde and H.Verlinde have suggested an effective\ntwo-dimensional theory describing the high-energy scattering in QCD. In this\nreport we attempt to clarify some issues of this suggestion. We consider {\\it\nanisotropic asymptotics} of correlation functions for scalar and gauge theories\nin four dimensions. Anisotropic asymptotics describe behaviour of correlation\nfunctions when some components of coordinates are large as compare with others\ncomponents. It is occurred that (2+2) anisotropic asymptotics for 4-points\nfunctions are related with the well known Regge regime of scattering\namplitudes. We study an expansion of correlation functions with respect to the\nrescaling parameter $\\lambda$ over a part of variables (anisotropic\n$\\lambda$-expansion). An effective theory describing the anisotropic limit of\nfree scalar field contains two 2 dim conformal theories. One of them is a\nconformal theory in configuration space and another one is a conformal theory\nin momentum space. In some special cases ,in particular for the Wilson line\ncorrelators in gauge theories, the leading term of the anisotropic expansion\ninvolves only one of the conformal theories and it can be described by an\neffective theory with an action being a dimensional reduction of the original\naction. \n\n"}

The charge collection properties of the diamond sensor were studied\nas a function of the track position, which was measured with a silicon\nmicrostrip telescope. Non-uniformities were observed on a length scale\ncomparable to the diamond crystallites size. In some regions of the sensor, the\ncharge drift appears to have a component parallel to the sensor surface (i.e.,\nnormal to the applied electric field) resulting in systematic residuals between\nthe track position and the hits position as large as 40 $\\mu$m. A numerical\nsimulation of the charge drift in polycrystalline diamond was developed to\ncompute the signal induced on the electrodes by the electrons and holes\nreleased by the passing particles.
