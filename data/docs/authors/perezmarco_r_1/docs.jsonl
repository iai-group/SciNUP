{"id": "0706.2606", "contents": "Title: Randomness Extraction via Delta-Biased Masking in the Presence of a\n  Quantum Attacker Abstract: Randomness extraction is of fundamental importance for information-theoretic\ncryptography. It allows to transform a raw key about which an attacker has some\nlimited knowledge into a fully secure random key, on which the attacker has\nessentially no information. Up to date, only very few randomness-extraction\ntechniques are known to work against an attacker holding quantum information on\nthe raw key. This is very much in contrast to the classical (non-quantum)\nsetting, which is much better understood and for which a vast amount of\ndifferent techniques are known and proven to work.\n  We prove a new randomness-extraction technique, which is known to work in the\nclassical setting, to be secure against a quantum attacker as well. Randomness\nextraction is done by XOR'ing a so-called delta-biased mask to the raw key. Our\nresult allows to extend the classical applications of this extractor to the\nquantum setting. We discuss the following two applications. We show how to\nencrypt a long message with a short key, information-theoretically secure\nagainst a quantum attacker, provided that the attacker has enough quantum\nuncertainty on the message. This generalizes the concept of entropically-secure\nencryption to the case of a quantum attacker. As second application, we show\nhow to do error-correction without leaking partial information to a quantum\nattacker. Such a technique is useful in settings where the raw key may contain\nerrors, since standard error-correction techniques may provide the attacker\nwith information on, say, a secret key that was used to obtain the raw key. \n\n"}

Reasoning\nabout privacy, however, is fraught with pitfalls. One of the most significant\nis the auxiliary information (also called external knowledge, background\nknowledge, or side information) that an adversary gleans from other channels\nsuch as the web, public records, or domain knowledge. This paper explores how\none can reason about privacy in the face of rich, realistic sources of\nauxiliary information. Specifically, we investigate the effectiveness of\ncurrent anonymization schemes in preserving privacy when multiple organizations\nindependently release anonymized data about overlapping populations. 1. We\ninvestigate composition attacks, in which an adversary uses independent\nanonymized releases to breach privacy. We explain why recently proposed models\nof limited auxiliary information fail to capture composition attacks. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that even a simple instance of a composition attack can\nbreach privacy in practice, for a large class of currently proposed techniques.\nThe class includes k-anonymity and several recent variants. 2. On a more\npositive note, certain randomization-based notions of privacy (such as\ndifferential privacy) provably resist composition attacks and, in fact, the use\nof arbitrary side information. This resistance enables stand-alone design of\nanonymization schemes, without the need for explicitly keeping track of other\nreleases. We provide a precise formulation of this property, and prove that an\nimportant class of relaxations of differential privacy also satisfy the\nproperty.

In addition they are at the\nforefront in terms of implementations. As such they represent an excellent\nopportunity to move towards integrated protocols involving many of these\nelements. In this paper we look at expressing and extending graph state secret\nsharing and MBQC in a common framework and graphical language related to flow.\nWe do so with two main contributions.\n  First we express in entirely graphical terms which set of players can access\nwhich information in graph state secret sharing protocols.

We first present a \"one-time stegosystem\" that\nallows two parties to transmit messages of length at most that of the shared\nkey with information-theoretic security guarantees. The employment of a\npseudorandom generator (PRG) permits secure transmission of longer messages in\nthe same way that such a generator allows the use of one-time pad encryption\nfor messages longer than the key in symmetric encryption. The advantage of our\nconstruction, compared to all previous work is randomness efficiency: in the\ninformation theoretic setting our protocol embeds a message of length n bits\nusing a shared secret key of length (1+o(1))n bits while achieving security\n2^{-n/log^{O(1)}n}; simply put this gives a rate of key over message that is 1\nas n tends to infinity (the previous best result achieved a constant rate\ngreater than 1 regardless of the security offered).

Differential privacy is a well-established\ndefinition of privacy--this is a universal guarantee against all attackers,\nwhatever their side-information or intent. In this paper, we present a\nuniversal treatment of utility based on the standard minimax rule from decision\ntheory (in contrast to the utility model in, which is Bayesian). In our model,\ninformation consumers are minimax (risk-averse) agents, each possessing some\nside-information about the query, and each endowed with a loss-function which\nmodels their tolerance to inaccuracies. Further, information consumers are\nrational in the sense that they actively combine information from the mechanism\nwith their side-information in a way that minimizes their loss. Under this\nassumption of rational behavior, we show that for every fixed count query, a\ncertain geometric mechanism is universally optimal for all minimax information\nconsumers. Additionally, our solution makes it possible to release query\nresults at multiple levels of privacy in a collusion-resistant manner. \n\n"}

Such approaches aim to minimize network delay, increase capacity, and\nenhance security services between two core (relay) network nodes, an ingress\nnode and an egress node. MATE (Multipath Adaptive Traffic Engineering) has been\nproposed for multipath adaptive traffic engineering between an ingress node\n(source) and an egress node (destination) to distribute the network flow among\nmultiple disjoint paths. Its novel idea is to avoid network congestion and\nattacks that might exist in edge and node disjoint paths between two core\nnetwork nodes.\n  This paper proposes protection schemes over asymmetric channels. Precisely,\nthe paper aims to develop an adaptive, robust, and reliable traffic engineering\nscheme to improve performance and reliability of communication networks. This\nscheme will also provision Quality of Server (QoS) and protection of traffic\nengineering to maximize network efficiency. Specifically, S-MATE (secure MATE)\nis proposed to protect the network traffic between two core nodes (routers,\nswitches, etc.) in a cloud network. S-MATE secures against a single link\nattack/failure by adding redundancy in one of the operational redundant paths\nbetween the sender and receiver nodes. It is also extended to secure against\nmultiple attacked links. The proposed scheme can be applied to secure core\nnetworks such as optical and IP networks. \n\n"}

How to benefit from the adversary's\nuncertainty about the data? We have found that random sampling provides a\nconnection that helps answer these two questions, as sampling can create\nuncertainty. The main result of the paper is that $k$-anonymization, when done\n\"safely\", and when preceded with a random sampling step, satisfies\n$(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-differential privacy with reasonable parameters. This\nresult illustrates that \"hiding in a crowd of $k$\" indeed offers some privacy\nguarantees.

This scheme uses a new authentication key in each\nauthentication attempt, to select a hash function from an Almost Strongly\nUniversal$_2$ hash function family. The partial knowledge of the attacker is\nmeasured as the trace distance between the authentication key distribution and\nthe uniform distribution; this is the usual measure in QKD. We provide direct\nproofs of security of the scheme, when using partially known key, first in the\ninformation-theoretic setting and then in terms of witness indistinguishability\nas used in the Universal Composability (UC) framework. We find that if the\nauthentication procedure has a failure probability $\\epsilon$ and the\nauthentication key has an $\\epsilon'$ trace distance to the uniform, then under\nITS, the adversary's success probability conditioned on an authentic\nmessage-tag pair is only bounded by $\\epsilon+|\\mT|\\epsilon'$, where $|\\mT|$ is\nthe size of the set of tags.

MMF transmission can be modeled via a broadcast\nchannel in which both the legitimate receiver's and wiretapper's channels are\nmultiple-input-multiple-output complex Gaussian channels.

This\nleads to the two basic features of our scheme: a highlyoptimized algorithm that\nachieves very good performance and a passive analysis that is undetectable. We\npropose a new passive analysis technique where detection is based on\nNeyman-Pearson lemma. We correlate the inter-packet delays (IPDs) from both\nflows.

When\nthese challenges are tackled in the development of future cloud systems, the\nattractiveness of new use cases in a sensor-enabled world will considerably be\nincreased for users who currently do not trust the Cloud. \n\n"}
{"id": "1310.7935", "contents": "Title: The Unreasonable Fundamental Incertitudes Behind Bitcoin Mining Abstract: Bitcoin is a \"crypto currency\", a decentralized electronic payment scheme\nbased on cryptography which has recently gained excessive popularity.\nScientific research on bitcoin is less abundant. A paper at Financial\nCryptography 2012 conference explains that it is a system which \"uses no fancy\ncryptography\", and is \"by no means perfect\". It depends on a well-known\ncryptographic standard SHA-256. In this paper we revisit the cryptographic\nprocess which allows one to make money by producing bitcoins. We reformulate\nthis problem as a Constrained Input Small Output (CISO) hashing problem and\nreduce the problem to a pure block cipher problem. We estimate the speed of\nthis process and we show that the cost of this process is less than it seems\nand it depends on a certain cryptographic constant which we estimated to be at\nmost 1.86. These optimizations enable bitcoin miners to save tens of millions\nof dollars per year in electricity bills. Miners who set up mining operations\nface many economic incertitudes such as high volatility. In this paper we point\nout that there are fundamental incertitudes which depend very strongly on the\nbitcoin specification. The energy efficiency of bitcoin miners have already\nbeen improved by a factor of about 10,000, and we claim that further\nimprovements are inevitable. Better technology is bound to be invented, would\nit be quantum miners. More importantly, the specification is likely to change.\nA major change have been proposed in May 2013 at Bitcoin conference in San\nDiego by Dan Kaminsky. However, any sort of change could be flatly rejected by\nthe community which have heavily invested in mining with the current\ntechnology. Another question is the reward halving scheme in bitcoin. The\ncurrent bitcoin specification mandates a strong 4-year cyclic property. We find\nthis property totally unreasonable and harmful and explain why and how it needs\nto be changed. \n\n"}

Attack\ntechniques proposed in the literature often require detailed knowledge of\nsystem parameters. Such information is difficult to acquire in practice. The\nsubspace methods presented in this paper, on the other hand, learn the system\noperating subspace from measurements and launch attacks accordingly. Conditions\nfor the existence of an unobservable subspace attack are obtained under the\nfull and partial measurement models. Using the estimated system subspace, two\nattack strategies are presented. The first strategy aims to affect the system\nstate directly by hiding the attack vector in the system subspace. The second\nstrategy misleads the bad data detection mechanism so that data not under\nattack are removed.

For example,\ncookies might be cleared by users regularly. Apple has stopped apps accessing\nUDIDs, and Android phones use some special permission to protect IMEI code. To\naddress this challenge, some recent studies have worked on tracing smart phones\nusing the hardware features resulted from the imperfect manufacturing process.\nThese works have demonstrated that different devices can be differentiated to\neach other. However, it still has a long way to go in order to replace cookie\nand be deployed in real world scenarios, especially in terms of properties like\nuniqueness, robustness, etc. In this paper, we presented a novel method to\ngenerate stable and unique device ID stealthy for smartphones by exploiting the\nfrequency response of the speaker.

But different\nsecurity scenarios were often modeled via different types of games and analyzed\nin an ad-hoc manner. In this paper, we propose an algebraic approach for\nmodeling and analyzing uniformly several types of network security games. This\napproach is based on a probabilistic extension of the value-passing Calculus of\nCommunicating Systems (CCS) which is regarded as a Generative model for\nProbabilistic Value-passing CCS (PVCCSG for short). Our approach gives a\nuniform framework, called PVCCSG based security model, for the security\nscenarios modeled via perfect and complete or incomplete information games. We\npresent then a uniform algorithm for computing the Nash equilibria strategies\nof a network security game on its PVCCSG based security model. The algorithm\nfirst generates a transition system for each of the PVCCSG based security\nmodels, then simplifies this transition system through graph-theoretic\nabstraction and bisimulation minimization. Then, a backward induction method,\nwhich is only applicable to finite tree models, can be used to compute all the\nNash equilibria strategies of the (possibly infinite) security games. This\nalgorithm is implemented and can also be tuned smoothly for computing its\nsocial optimal strategies. The effectiveness and efficiency of this approach\nare further demonstrated with four detailed case studies from the field of\nnetwork security. \n\n"}

However, ZIA contains one major security weakness - unauthorized\nphysical access to the token, e.g., during lunch-time or upon theft, allows the\nattacker to have unfettered access to the terminal.\n  In this paper, we address this gaping vulnerability with ZIA systems by\n(un)locking the authentication token with the user's walking pattern as she\napproaches the terminal to access it. Since a user's walking or gait pattern is\nbelieved to be unique, only that user (no imposter) would be able to unlock the\ntoken to gain access to the terminal in a ZIA session.

While many attack vectors have already been uncovered,\none important vector has been left out though: attacking the currency via the\nInternet routing infrastructure itself. Indeed, by manipulating routing\nadvertisements (BGP hijacks) or by naturally intercepting traffic, Autonomous\nSystems (ASes) can intercept and manipulate a large fraction of Bitcoin\ntraffic.\n  This paper presents the first taxonomy of routing attacks and their impact on\nBitcoin, considering both small-scale attacks, targeting individual nodes, and\nlarge-scale attacks, targeting the network as a whole. While challenging, we\nshow that two key properties make routing attacks practical: (i) the efficiency\nof routing manipulation; and (ii) the significant centralization of Bitcoin in\nterms of mining and routing. Specifically, we find that any network attacker\ncan hijack few (<100) BGP prefixes to isolate ~50% of the mining power---even\nwhen considering that mining pools are heavily multi-homed. We also show that\non-path network attackers can considerably slow down block propagation by\ninterfering with few key Bitcoin messages.\n  We demonstrate the feasibility of each attack against the deployed Bitcoin\nsoftware. We also quantify their effectiveness on the current Bitcoin topology\nusing data collected from a Bitcoin supernode combined with BGP routing data.\n  The potential damage to Bitcoin is worrying. By isolating parts of the\nnetwork or delaying block propagation, attackers can cause a significant amount\nof mining power to be wasted, leading to revenue losses and enabling a wide\nrange of exploits such as double spending. To prevent such effects in practice,\nwe provide both short and long-term countermeasures, some of which can be\ndeployed immediately. \n\n"}

These\nelectronic control units (ECUs) communicate with each other in an in-vehicle\nnetwork that makes the vehicle both safer and easier to drive. Controller Area\nNetworks (CANs) are the current standard for such high quality in-vehicle\ncommunication. Unfortunately, however, CANs do not currently offer protection\nagainst security attacks. In particular, they do not allow for message\nauthentication and hence are open to attacks that replay ECU messages for\nmalicious purposes. Applying the classic cryptographic method of message\nauthentication code (MAC) is not feasible since the CAN data frame is not long\nenough to include a sufficiently long MAC to provide effective authentication.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel identification method, which works in the\nphysical layer of an in-vehicle CAN network. Our method identifies ECUs using\ninimitable characteristics of signals enabling detection of a compromised or\nalien ECU being used in a replay attack. Unlike previous attempts to address\nsecurity issues in the in-vehicle CAN network, our method works by simply\nadding a monitoring unit to the existing network, making it deployable in\ncurrent systems and compliant with required CAN standards.

In many cases, these modifications can\nbe so subtle that a human observer does not even notice the modification at\nall, yet the classifier still makes a mistake.

In this\npaper, we develop a method for automatically quantifying the extent to which\npatterned variations in a file's entropy signal make it \"suspicious.\" In\nExperiment 1, we use wavelet transforms to define a Suspiciously Structured\nEntropic Change Score (SSECS), a scalar feature that quantifies the\nsuspiciousness of a file based on its distribution of entropic energy across\nmultiple levels of spatial resolution. Based on this single feature, it was\npossible to raise predictive accuracy on a malware detection task from 50.0% to\n68.7%, even though the single feature was applied to a heterogeneous corpus of\nmalware discovered \"in the wild.\" In Experiment 2, we describe how\nwavelet-based decompositions of software entropy can be applied to a parasitic\nmalware detection task involving large numbers of samples and features.

Many prior studies have\nbeen performed to understand and mitigate this issue, but component hijacking\nremains a serious open problem in the Android ecosystem due to no effective\ndefense deployed in the wild. In this paper, we present our vision on\npractically defending against component hijacking in Android apps. First, we\nargue that to fundamentally prevent component hijacking, we need to switch from\nthe previous mindset (i.e., performing system-level control or repackaging\nvulnerable apps after they are already released) to a more proactive version\nthat aims to help security-inexperienced developers make secure components in\nthe first place.

In such an attack, the quantum adversary has the ability to query the\ncryptographic functionality in superposition. The vulnerable cryptosystems\ninclude the Even-Mansour block cipher, the three-round Feistel network, the\nEncrypted-CBC-MAC, and many others. In this work, we study simple algebraic\nadaptations of such schemes that replace $(\\mathbb Z/2)^n$ addition with\noperations over alternate finite groups--such as $\\mathbb Z/{2^n}$--and provide\nevidence that these adaptations are qCPA-secure. These adaptations furthermore\nretain the classical security properties (and basic structural features)\nenjoyed by the original schemes.\n  We establish security by treating the (quantum) hardness of the well-studied\nHidden Shift problem as a basic cryptographic assumption. We observe that this\nproblem has a number of attractive features in this cryptographic context,\nincluding random self-reducibility, hardness amplification, and--in many cases\nof interest--a reduction from the \"search version\" to the \"decisional version.\"\nWe then establish, under this assumption, the qCPA-security of several such\nHidden Shift adaptations of symmetric-key constructions. We show that a Hidden\nShift version of the Even-Mansour block cipher yields a quantum-secure\npseudorandom function, and that a Hidden Shift version of the Encrypted CBC-MAC\nyields a collision-resistant hash function. Finally, we observe that such\nadaptations frustrate the direct Simon's algorithm-based attacks in more\ngeneral circumstances, e.g., Feistel networks and slide attacks. \n\n"}

Digital\nforensic investigators can somewhat mitigate the latter issue through the use\nof high-speed storage options, such as networked RAID storage, in the\ncontrolled environment of the forensic laboratory.

We introduce a\ngeneral privacy-preserving framework for Variational Bayes (VB), a widely used\noptimization-based Bayesian inference method. Our framework respects\ndifferential privacy, the gold-standard privacy criterion, and encompasses a\nlarge class of probabilistic models, called the Conjugate Exponential (CE)\nfamily. We observe that we can straightforwardly privatise VB's approximate\nposterior distributions for models in the CE family, by perturbing the expected\nsufficient statistics of the complete-data likelihood. For a broadly-used class\nof non-CE models, those with binomial likelihoods, we show how to bring such\nmodels into the CE family, such that inferences in the modified model resemble\nthe private variational Bayes algorithm as closely as possible, using the\nPolya-Gamma data augmentation scheme. The iterative nature of variational Bayes\npresents a further challenge since iterations increase the amount of noise\nneeded. We overcome this by combining: (1) an improved composition method for\ndifferential privacy, called the moments accountant, which provides a tight\nbound on the privacy cost of multiple VB iterations and thus significantly\ndecreases the amount of additive noise; and (2) the privacy amplification\neffect of subsampling mini-batches from large-scale data in stochastic\nlearning.

In this paper, we investigate the problem of\nprivate machine learning, where as common in practice, the data is not given at\nonce, but rather arrives incrementally over time.\n  We introduce the problems of private incremental ERM and private incremental\nregression where the general goal is to always maintain a good empirical risk\nminimizer for the history observed under differential privacy. Our first\ncontribution is a generic transformation of private batch ERM mechanisms into\nprivate incremental ERM mechanisms, based on a simple idea of invoking the\nprivate batch ERM procedure at some regular time intervals. We take this\nconstruction as a baseline for comparison. We then provide two mechanisms for\nthe private incremental regression problem. Our first mechanism is based on\nprivately constructing a noisy incremental gradient function, which is then\nused in a modified projected gradient procedure at every timestep. This\nmechanism has an excess empirical risk of $\\approx\\sqrt{d}$, where $d$ is the\ndimensionality of the data. While from the results of [Bassily et al. 2014]\nthis bound is tight in the worst-case, we show that certain geometric\nproperties of the input and constraint set can be used to derive significantly\nbetter results for certain interesting regression problems. \n\n"}

We identify three key desiderata that a\nPRL solution must ensure: 1) perfect precision and high recall of matching\npairs, 2) a proof of end-to-end privacy, and 3) communication and computational\ncosts that scale subquadratically in the number of input records. We show that\nall of the existing solutions for PRL - including secure 2-party computation\n(S2PC), and their variants that use non-private or differentially private (DP)\nblocking to ensure subquadratic cost - violate at least one of the three\ndesiderata. In particular, S2PC techniques guarantee end-to-end privacy but\nhave either low recall or quadratic cost. In contrast, no end-to-end privacy\nguarantee has been formalized for solutions that achieve subquadratic cost.\nThis is true even for solutions that compose DP and S2PC: DP does not permit\nthe release of any exact information about the databases, while S2PC algorithms\nfor PRL allow the release of matching records.\n  In light of this deficiency, we propose a novel privacy model, called output\nconstrained differential privacy, that shares the strong privacy protection of\nDP, but allows for the truthful release of the output of a certain function\napplied to the data. We apply this to PRL, and show that protocols satisfying\nthis privacy model permit the disclosure of the true matching records, but\ntheir execution is insensitive to the presence or absence of a single\nnon-matching record. We find that prior work that combine DP and S2PC\ntechniques even fail to satisfy this end-to-end privacy model.

In the strategically-timed attack, the\nadversary aims at minimizing the agent's reward by only attacking the agent at\na small subset of time steps in an episode. Limiting the attack activity to\nthis subset helps prevent detection of the attack by the agent. We propose a\nnovel method to determine when an adversarial example should be crafted and\napplied. In the enchanting attack, the adversary aims at luring the agent to a\ndesignated target state. This is achieved by combining a generative model and a\nplanning algorithm: while the generative model predicts the future states, the\nplanning algorithm generates a preferred sequence of actions for luring the\nagent. A sequence of adversarial examples is then crafted to lure the agent to\ntake the preferred sequence of actions. We apply the two tactics to the agents\ntrained by the state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithm including\nDQN and A3C.

A variety of applications now run\nsimultaneously on an ARM-based processor. For example, devices on the edge of\nthe Internet are provided with higher horsepower to be entrusted with storing,\nprocessing and analyzing data collected from IoT devices. This significantly\nimproves efficiency and reduces the amount of data that needs to be transported\nto the cloud for data processing, analysis and storage. However, commodity OSes\nare prone to compromise. Once they are exploited, attackers can access the data\non these devices. Since the data stored and processed on the devices can be\nsensitive, left untackled, this is particularly disconcerting.\n  In this paper, we propose a new system, TrustShadow that shields legacy\napplications from untrusted OSes. TrustShadow takes advantage of ARM TrustZone\ntechnology and partitions resources into the secure and normal worlds. In the\nsecure world, TrustShadow constructs a trusted execution environment for\nsecurity-critical applications. This trusted environment is maintained by a\nlightweight runtime system that coordinates the communication between\napplications and the ordinary OS running in the normal world. The runtime\nsystem does not provide system services itself. Rather, it forwards requests\nfor system services to the ordinary OS, and verifies the correctness of the\nresponses. To demonstrate the efficiency of this design, we prototyped\nTrustShadow on a real chip board with ARM TrustZone support, and evaluated its\nperformance using both microbenchmarks and real-world applications. We showed\nTrustShadow introduces only negligible overhead to real-world applications. \n\n"}

Typically, the security analysis of these proposals has\nlargely been informal. However, formal analysis can be used to expose flaws and\nultimately provide a higher level of assurance in the protocols.\n  This paper focusses on the formal analysis of a particular element of\nsecurity mechanisms for V2X found in many proposals: the revocation of\nmalicious or misbehaving vehicles from the V2X system by invalidating their\ncredentials. This revocation needs to be performed in an unlinkable way for\nvehicle privacy even in the context of vehicles regularly changing their\npseudonyms.

Specifically, if the source\nhas pseudoentropy at least $k$, then it has pseudoentropy at least $k-\\ell$\nconditioned on an $\\ell$-qubit leakage. (2) As an application of the Leakage\nChain Rule, we construct the first quantum leakage-resilient stream-cipher in\nthe bounded-quantum-storage model, assuming the existence of a quantum-secure\npseudorandom generator.

However, with a wide\nvariety of sensitive data collected, protecting privacy of individuals,\ncommunities and organizations, is an essential factor in making data \"open\".\nThe approaches currently adopted by industry in releasing private data are\noften ad hoc and prone to a number of attacks, including re-identification\nattacks, as they do not provide adequate privacy guarantees. While differential\nprivacy has attracted significant interest from academia and industry by\nproviding rigorous and reliable privacy guarantees, the reduced utility and\ninflexibility of current differentially private algorithms for data release is\na barrier to their use in real-life. This paper aims to address these two\nchallenges.

Secure\nmultiparty computation (SMC) is a viable panacea for this, allowing distributed\nparties to make computations while the parties learn nothing about their data,\nbut the final result. Although SMC is instrumental in such distributed\nsettings, it does not provide any guarantees not to leak any information about\nindividuals to adversaries. Differential privacy (DP) can be utilized to\naddress this; however, achieving SMC with DP is not a trivial task, either. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel Secure Multiparty Distributed Differentially\nPrivate (SM-DDP) protocol to achieve secure and private computations in a\nmultiparty environment. Specifically, with our protocol, we simultaneously\nachieve SMC and DP in distributed settings focusing on linear regression on\nhorizontally distributed data.

For example, various relativistic bit commitment protocols\nhave been proposed. Although it has been shown that bit commitment is\nsufficient to construct oblivious transfer and thus multiparty computation,\ncomposing specific relativistic protocols in this way is known to be insecure.\nA composable framework is required to perform such a modular security analysis\nof construction schemes, but no known frameworks can handle models of\ncomputation in Minkowski space.\n  By instantiating the systems model from the Abstract Cryptography framework\nwith Causal Boxes, we obtain such a composable framework, in which messages are\nassigned a location in Minkowski space (or superpositions thereof).

Second, our protocol's computational cost is commensurate with the cost of\nan attacker.

It is computationally expensive to directly employ a well-studied\nstatic algorithm repeatedly on the network snapshots of the dynamic networks.\nWe propose DynaMo, a novel modularity-based dynamic community detection\nalgorithm, aiming to detect communities of dynamic networks as effective as\nrepeatedly applying static algorithms but in a more efficient way. DynaMo is an\nadaptive and incremental algorithm, which is designed for incrementally\nmaximizing the modularity gain while updating the community structure of\ndynamic networks. In the experimental evaluation, a comprehensive comparison\nhas been made among DynaMo, Louvain (static) and 5 other dynamic algorithms.\nExtensive experiments have been conducted on 6 real-world networks and 10,000\nsynthetic networks. Our results show that DynaMo outperforms all the other 5\ndynamic algorithms in terms of the effectiveness, and is 2 to 5 times (by\naverage) faster than Louvain algorithm. \n\n"}

This prompts\nthe question as to whether or not other classical schemes may be generalized to\narbitrary groups and whether classical results still apply to those generalized\nschemes.

We show that Even and Mansour's original notions of secrecy are\nobtained on a one-key, group variant of the Even-Mansour cipher. We generalize\nthe result by Kilian and Rogaway, that the Even-Mansour cipher is pseudorandom,\nto super pseudorandomness, also in the one-key, group case. Using a Slide\nAttack we match the bound found above. After generalizing the Feistel cipher to\narbitrary groups we resolve an open problem of Patel, Ramzan, and Sundaram by\nshowing that the 3-round Feistel cipher over an arbitrary group is not super\npseudorandom.

Unlike previous\napproaches, our distributed ledger solution provides an accountable revocation\nmechanism without requiring trust in a single misbehavior authority, instead\nallowing a collaborative and transparent decision making process through\nBlackchain. This makes Blackchain an attractive alternative to existing\nsolutions for revocation in a Security Credential Management System (SCMS),\nwhich suffer from the traditional disadvantages of PKIs, notably including\ncentralized trust.

For example, deep\nlearning-based face recognition systems have been used to authenticate users to\naccess many security-sensitive applications like payment apps. Such usages of\ndeep learning systems provide the adversaries with sufficient incentives to\nperform attacks against these systems for their adversarial purposes. In this\nwork, we consider a new type of attacks, called backdoor attacks, where the\nattacker's goal is to create a backdoor into a learning-based authentication\nsystem, so that he can easily circumvent the system by leveraging the backdoor.\nSpecifically, the adversary aims at creating backdoor instances, so that the\nvictim learning system will be misled to classify the backdoor instances as a\ntarget label specified by the adversary. In particular, we study backdoor\npoisoning attacks, which achieve backdoor attacks using poisoning strategies.\nDifferent from all existing work, our studied poisoning strategies can apply\nunder a very weak threat model: (1) the adversary has no knowledge of the model\nand the training set used by the victim system; (2) the attacker is allowed to\ninject only a small amount of poisoning samples; (3) the backdoor key is hard\nto notice even by human beings to achieve stealthiness. We conduct evaluation\nto demonstrate that a backdoor adversary can inject only around 50 poisoning\nsamples, while achieving an attack success rate of above 90%. We are also the\nfirst work to show that a data poisoning attack can create physically\nimplementable backdoors without touching the training process. Our work\ndemonstrates that backdoor poisoning attacks pose real threats to a learning\nsystem, and thus highlights the importance of further investigation and\nproposing defense strategies against them. \n\n"}

For example, if the destination of a branch depends on a memory\nvalue that is in the process of being read, CPUs will try guess the destination\nand attempt to execute ahead. When the memory value finally arrives, the CPU\neither discards or commits the speculative computation. Speculative logic is\nunfaithful in how it executes, can access to the victim's memory and registers,\nand can perform operations with measurable side effects.\n  Spectre attacks involve inducing a victim to speculatively perform operations\nthat would not occur during correct program execution and which leak the\nvictim's confidential information via a side channel to the adversary. This\npaper describes practical attacks that combine methodology from side channel\nattacks, fault attacks, and return-oriented programming that can read arbitrary\nmemory from the victim's process. More broadly, the paper shows that\nspeculative execution implementations violate the security assumptions\nunderpinning numerous software security mechanisms, including operating system\nprocess separation, static analysis, containerization, just-in-time (JIT)\ncompilation, and countermeasures to cache timing/side-channel attacks.

In this paper, we present the first systematic analysis of privacy\nissues induced by hashtags. We concentrate in particular on location, which is\nrecognized as one of the key privacy concerns in the Internet era. By relying\non a random forest model, we show that we can infer a user's precise location\nfrom hashtags with accuracy of 70\\% to 76\\%, depending on the city. To remedy\nthis situation, we introduce a system called Tagvisor that systematically\nsuggests alternative hashtags if the user-selected ones constitute a threat to\nlocation privacy. Tagvisor realizes this by means of three conceptually\ndifferent obfuscation techniques and a semantics-based metric for measuring the\nconsequent utility loss. Our findings show that obfuscating as little as two\nhashtags already provides a near-optimal trade-off between privacy and utility\nin our dataset.

Each ACC provides one access control method for a\nsubject-object pair, and implements both static access right validation based\non predefined policies and dynamic access right validation by checking the\nbehavior of the subject. The JC implements a misbehavior-judging method to\nfacilitate the dynamic validation of the ACCs by receiving misbehavior reports\nfrom the ACCs, judging the misbehavior and returning the corresponding penalty.\nThe RC registers the information of the access control and misbehavior-judging\nmethods as well as their smart contracts, and also provides functions (e.g.,\nregister, update and delete) to manage these methods. To demonstrate the\napplication of the framework, we provide a case study in an IoT system with one\ndesktop computer, one laptop and two Raspberry Pi single-board computers, where\nthe ACCs, JC and RC are implemented based on the Ethereum smart contract\nplatform to achieve the access control. \n\n"}

Both algorithms that create adversarial examples and\nstrategies for defending against them typically use $L_p$-norms to measure the\nperceptual similarity between an adversarial input and its benign original.\nPrior work has already shown, however, that two images need not be close to\neach other as measured by an $L_p$-norm to be perceptually similar. In this\nwork, we show that nearness according to an $L_p$-norm is not just unnecessary\nfor perceptual similarity, but is also insufficient. Specifically, focusing on\ndatasets (CIFAR10 and MNIST), $L_p$-norms, and thresholds used in prior work,\nwe show through online user studies that \"adversarial examples\" that are closer\nto their benign counterparts than required by commonly used $L_p$-norm\nthresholds can nevertheless be perceptually different to humans from the\ncorresponding benign examples. Namely, the perceptual distance between two\nimages that are \"near\" each other according to an $L_p$-norm can be high enough\nthat participants frequently classify the two images as representing different\nobjects or digits. Combined with prior work, we thus demonstrate that nearness\nof inputs as measured by $L_p$-norms is neither necessary nor sufficient for\nperceptual similarity, which has implications for both creating and defending\nagainst adversarial examples.

Although many mechanisms such as the Laplace and\nGaussian mechanisms can be extended to a matrix-valued query function by adding\ni.i.d. noise to each element of the matrix, this method is often sub-optimal as\nit forfeits an opportunity to exploit the structural characteristics typically\nassociated with matrix analysis. In this work, we consider the design of\ndifferential privacy mechanism specifically for a matrix-valued query function.\nThe proposed solution is to utilize a matrix-variate noise, as opposed to the\ntraditional scalar-valued noise. Particularly, we propose a novel differential\nprivacy mechanism called the Matrix-Variate Gaussian (MVG) mechanism, which\nadds a matrix-valued noise drawn from a matrix-variate Gaussian distribution.\nWe prove that the MVG mechanism preserves $(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-differential\nprivacy, and show that it allows the structural characteristics of the\nmatrix-valued query function to naturally be exploited. Furthermore, due to the\nmulti-dimensional nature of the MVG mechanism and the matrix-valued query, we\nintroduce the concept of directional noise, which can be utilized to mitigate\nthe impact the noise has on the utility of the query. Finally, we demonstrate\nthe performance of the MVG mechanism and the advantages of directional noise\nusing three matrix-valued queries on three privacy-sensitive datasets. We find\nthat the MVG mechanism notably outperforms four previous state-of-the-art\napproaches, and provides comparable utility to the non-private baseline.

A common\nrequirement is robustness to adversarial perturbations in a neighbourhood\naround an input. In this paper we focus on the $L_0$ norm and aim to compute,\nfor a trained DNN and an input, the maximal radius of a safe norm ball around\nthe input within which there are no adversarial examples. Then we define global\nrobustness as an expectation of the maximal safe radius over a test data set.\nWe first show that the problem is NP-hard, and then propose an approximate\napproach to iteratively compute lower and upper bounds on the network's\nrobustness. The approach is \\emph{anytime}, i.e., it returns intermediate\nbounds and robustness estimates that are gradually, but strictly, improved as\nthe computation proceeds; \\emph{tensor-based}, i.e., the computation is\nconducted over a set of inputs simultaneously, instead of one by one, to enable\nefficient GPU computation; and has \\emph{provable guarantees}, i.e., both the\nbounds and the robustness estimates can converge to their optimal values.\nFinally, we demonstrate the utility of the proposed approach in practice to\ncompute tight bounds by applying and adapting the anytime algorithm to a set of\nchallenging problems, including global robustness evaluation, competitive $L_0$\nattacks, test case generation for DNNs, and local robustness evaluation on\nlarge-scale ImageNet DNNs.

In\nthis work, we propose ShapeShifter, an attack that tackles the more challenging\nproblem of crafting physical adversarial perturbations to fool image-based\nobject detectors like Faster R-CNN. Attacking an object detector is more\ndifficult than attacking an image classifier, as it needs to mislead the\nclassification results in multiple bounding boxes with different scales.\nExtending the digital attack to the physical world adds another layer of\ndifficulty, because it requires the perturbation to be robust enough to survive\nreal-world distortions due to different viewing distances and angles, lighting\nconditions, and camera limitations. We show that the Expectation over\nTransformation technique, which was originally proposed to enhance the\nrobustness of adversarial perturbations in image classification, can be\nsuccessfully adapted to the object detection setting. ShapeShifter can generate\nadversarially perturbed stop signs that are consistently mis-detected by Faster\nR-CNN as other objects, posing a potential threat to autonomous vehicles and\nother safety-critical computer vision systems. \n\n"}

This has led to the development of privacy-preserving query-based\nsystems. Based on the idea of \"sticky noise\", Diffix has been recently proposed\nas a novel query-based mechanism satisfying alone the EU Article~29 Working\nParty's definition of anonymization. According to its authors, Diffix adds less\nnoise to answers than solutions based on differential privacy while allowing\nfor an unlimited number of queries.\n  This paper presents a new class of noise-exploitation attacks, exploiting the\nnoise added by the system to infer private information about individuals in the\ndataset. Our first differential attack uses samples extracted from Diffix in a\nlikelihood ratio test to discriminate between two probability distributions. We\nshow that using this attack against a synthetic best-case dataset allows us to\ninfer private information with 89.4% accuracy using only 5 attributes. Our\nsecond cloning attack uses dummy conditions that conditionally strongly affect\nthe output of the query depending on the value of the private attribute. Using\nthis attack on four real-world datasets, we show that we can infer private\nattributes of at least 93% of the users in the dataset with accuracy between\n93.3% and 97.1%, issuing a median of 304 queries per user.

It has previously been argued that the only\nside-effect of quantum mining would be an increased difficulty.\n  In this work, we argue that a crucial argument in the analysis of Bitcoin\nsecurity breaks down when quantum mining is performed.\n  Classically, a Bitcoin fork occurs rarely, i.e., when two miners find a block\nalmost simultaneously, due to propagation time effects. The situation differs\ndramatically when quantum miners use Grover's algorithm, which repeatedly\napplies a procedure called a Grover iteration. The chances of finding a block\ngrow quadratically with the number of Grover iterations applied. Crucially, a\nminer does not have to choose how many iterations to apply in advance. Suppose\nAlice receives Bob's new block. To maximize her revenue, she should stop and\nmeasure her state immediately in the hopes that her block (rather than Bob's)\nwill become part of the longest chain. The strong correlation between the\nminers' actions and the fact that they all measure their states at the same\ntime may lead to more forks -- which is known to be a security risk for\nBitcoin.

The blockchain provider purchases from the\ninfrastructure provider, e.g., a cloud, the computing resources to maintain the\nblockchain consensus, and then offers blockchain services to the users. The\nblockchain provider strategizes its investment in the infrastructure and the\nservice price charged to the users, in order to improve the security of the\nblockchain and thus optimize its profit.

The major drawback of existing black-box\nattacks is the need for excessive model queries, which may give a false sense\nof model robustness due to inefficient query designs. To bridge this gap, we\npropose a generic framework for query-efficient black-box attacks. Our\nframework, AutoZOOM, which is short for Autoencoder-based Zeroth Order\nOptimization Method, has two novel building blocks towards efficient black-box\nattacks: (i) an adaptive random gradient estimation strategy to balance query\ncounts and distortion, and (ii) an autoencoder that is either trained offline\nwith unlabeled data or a bilinear resizing operation for attack acceleration.\nExperimental results suggest that, by applying AutoZOOM to a state-of-the-art\nblack-box attack (ZOO), a significant reduction in model queries can be\nachieved without sacrificing the attack success rate and the visual quality of\nthe resulting adversarial examples. In particular, when compared to the\nstandard ZOO method, AutoZOOM can consistently reduce the mean query counts in\nfinding successful adversarial examples (or reaching the same distortion level)\nby at least 93% on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, leading to novel\ninsights on adversarial robustness. \n\n"}

A unified\narchitecture is developed and evaluated for both non-sequential tasks and\nsequential ones. To validate the effectiveness, we take the scene text\nrecognition task as a case study. To our best knowledge, our proposed method is\nthe first attempt to adversarial attack for scene text recognition.

An adversary can build an algorithm to trace the individual members of\na model's training dataset. As a fundamental inference attack, he aims to\ndistinguish between data points that were part of the model's training set and\nany other data points from the same distribution. This is known as the tracing\n(and also membership inference) attack. In this paper, we focus on such attacks\nagainst black-box models, where the adversary can only observe the output of\nthe model, but not its parameters. This is the current setting of machine\nlearning as a service in the Internet.\n  We introduce a privacy mechanism to train machine learning models that\nprovably achieve membership privacy: the model's predictions on its training\ndata are indistinguishable from its predictions on other data points from the\nsame distribution. We design a strategic mechanism where the privacy mechanism\nanticipates the membership inference attacks. The objective is to train a model\nsuch that not only does it have the minimum prediction error (high utility),\nbut also it is the most robust model against its corresponding strongest\ninference attack (high privacy). We formalize this as a min-max game\noptimization problem, and design an adversarial training algorithm that\nminimizes the classification loss of the model as well as the maximum gain of\nthe membership inference attack against it. This strategy, which guarantees\nmembership privacy (as prediction indistinguishability), acts also as a strong\nregularizer and significantly generalizes the model.\n  We evaluate our privacy mechanism on deep neural networks using different\nbenchmark datasets. We show that our min-max strategy can mitigate the risk of\nmembership inference attacks (close to the random guess) with a negligible cost\nin terms of the classification error. \n\n"}

However, as soon\nas fault attacks are considered, assuming that the hardware performs its memory\noperations as instructed is not valid anymore. In particular, attackers may\ninduce faults with the goal of reading or writing incorrectly addressed memory,\nwhich can have various critical safety and security implications.\n  In this work, we present a solution to this problem and propose a new method\nfor protecting every memory access inside a program against address tampering.\nThe countermeasure comprises two building blocks. First, every pointer inside\nthe program is redundantly encoded using a multi-residue error detection code.\nThe redundancy information is stored in the unused upper bits of the pointer\nwith zero overhead in terms of storage. Second, load and store instructions are\nextended to link data with the corresponding encoded address from the pointer.\nWrong memory accesses subsequently infect the data value allowing the software\nto detect the error.\n  For evaluation purposes, we implemented our countermeasure into a RISC-V\nprocessor, tested it on a FPGA development board, and evaluated the induced\noverhead. Furthermore, a LLVM-based C compiler has been modified to\nautomatically encode all data pointers, to perform encoded pointer arithmetic,\nand to emit the extended load/store instructions with linking support.

Most redundancy schemes are not completely effective for providing\nhigh availability, durability and integrity in the long-term. We propose alpha\nentanglement codes, a mechanism that creates a virtual layer of highly\ninterconnected storage devices to propagate redundant information across a\nlarge scale storage system. Our motivation is to design flexible and practical\nerasure codes with high fault-tolerance to improve data durability and\navailability even in catastrophic scenarios. By flexible and practical, we mean\ncode settings that can be adapted to future requirements and practical\nimplementations with reasonable trade-offs between security, resource usage and\nperformance. The codes have three parameters. Alpha increases storage overhead\nlinearly but increases the possible paths to recover data exponentially. Two\nother parameters increase fault-tolerance even further without the need of\nadditional storage. As a result, an entangled storage system can provide high\navailability, durability and offer additional integrity: it is more difficult\nto modify data undetectably. We evaluate how several redundancy schemes perform\nin unreliable environments and show that alpha entanglement codes are flexible\nand practical codes. Remarkably, they excel at code locality, hence, they\nreduce repair costs and become less dependent on storage locations with poor\navailability.

However, such MLaaS systems raise privacy concerns such as model\nextraction. In model extraction attacks, adversaries maliciously exploit the\nquery interface to steal the model.

A TCR aims to provide incentives to create a well-curated\nlist. In this work, we consider a challenge for these systems - incentivizing\ntoken-holders to actually engage and participate in the voting process. We\npropose a novel token-inflation mechanism for enhancing engagement, whereby\nonly voting participants see their token supply increased by a pre-defined\nmultiple after each round of voting. To evaluate this proposal, we propose a\nsimple 4-class model of voters that captures all possible combinations of two\nkey dimensions: whether they are engaged (likely to vote at all for a given\nitem) or disengaged, and whether they are informed (likely to vote in a way\nthat increases the quality of the list) or uninformed, and a simple metric to\nevaluate the quality of the list as a function of the vote outcomes. We conduct\nsimulations using this model of voters and show that implementing\ntoken-inflation results in greater wealth accumulation for engaged voters. In\nparticular, when the number of informed voters is sufficiently high, our\nsimulations show that voters that are both informed and engaged see the\ngreatest benefits from participating in the registry when our proposed\ntoken-inflation mechanism is employed.

Device\nclassification methods are employed to enhance the security of IoT by detecting\nunregistered devices or traffic patterns. In recent years, blockchain has\nreceived tremendous attention as a distributed trustless platform to enhance\nthe security of IoT. Conventional device identification methods are not\ndirectly applicable in blockchain-based IoT as network layer packets are not\nstored in the blockchain. Moreover, the transactions are broadcast and thus\nhave no destination IP address and contain a public key as the user identity,\nand are stored permanently in blockchain which can be read by any entity in the\nnetwork. We show that device identification in blockchain introduces privacy\nrisks as the malicious nodes can identify users' activity pattern by analyzing\nthe temporal pattern of their transactions in the blockchain. We study the\nlikelihood of classifying IoT devices by analyzing their information stored in\nthe blockchain, which to the best of our knowledge, is the first work of its\nkind.

However, such attacks and their analysis have not been covered from\nthe perspective of unsupervised machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we\nseek to bridge this gap through multiple contributions. We first provide a\nstrong (iterative) black-box adversarial attack that can craft adversarial\nsamples which will be incorrectly clustered irrespective of the choice of\nclustering algorithm. We choose 4 prominent clustering algorithms, and a\nreal-world dataset to show the working of the proposed adversarial algorithm.\nUsing these clustering algorithms we also carry out a simple study of\ncross-technique adversarial attack transferability. \n\n"}

Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) has the potential to address\nthis challenge as it enables the use of CNNs on encrypted images. However,\ncurrent HE technology poses immense computational and memory overheads,\nparticularly for high-resolution images such as those seen in the clinical\ncontext. We present CaRENets: Compact and Resource-Efficient CNNs for high\nperformance and resource-efficient inference on high-resolution encrypted\nimages in practical applications. At the core, CaRENets comprises a new FHE\ncompact packing scheme that is tightly integrated with CNN functions. CaRENets\noffers dual advantages of memory efficiency (due to compact packing of images\nand CNN activations) and inference speed (due to the reduction in the number of\nciphertexts created and the associated mathematical operations) over standard\ninterleaved packing schemes. We apply CaRENets to perform homomorphic\nabnormality detection with 80-bit security level in two clinical conditions -\nRetinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) and Diabetic Retinopathy (DR).

In the case when\nthe potential function is the sum of a rotationally invariant function and the\nreal part of a polynomial of the complex coordinate, we use this relation and\nthe conformal mapping method developed by Entov and the first author to find\nthe shape of the support domain explicitly (up to finitely many undetermined\nparameters, which are to be found from a finite system of equations). In the\ncase when the rotationally invariant function is $\\beta |z|^2$, this is done by\nWiegmann-Zabrodin and Elbau-Felder.
