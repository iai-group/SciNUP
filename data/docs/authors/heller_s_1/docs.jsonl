Accordingly, all geometric objects defined in\nthis geometry are not only functions of the positional argument $x$, but also\ndepend on the directional argument $y$. Moreover, many new geometric objects,\nwhich have no counterpart in the classical AP-geometry, emerge in this\ndifferent framework. We refer to such a geometry as an Extended Absolute\nParallelism (EAP-) geometry. The building blocks of the EAP-geometry are a\nnonlinear connection assumed given a priori and $2n$ linearly independent\nvector fields (of special form) defined globally on $TM$ defining the\nparallelization. Four different $d$-connections are used to explore the\nproperties of this geometry.

In it we consider the numerical\ndiscretization of partial differential equations that are related to\ndifferential complexes so that de Rham cohomology and Hodge theory are key\ntools for the continuous problem. After a brief introduction to finite element\nmethods, the discretization methods we consider, we develop an abstract Hilbert\nspace framework for analyzing stability and convergence. In this framework, the\ndifferential complex is represented by a complex of Hilbert spaces and\nstability is obtained by transferring Hodge theoretic structures from the\ncontinuous level to the discrete. We show stable discretization is achieved if\nthe finite element spaces satisfy two hypotheses: they form a subcomplex and\nthere exists a bounded cochain projection from the full complex to the\nsubcomplex. Next, we consider the most canonical example of the abstract\ntheory, in which the Hilbert complex is the de Rham complex of a domain in\nEuclidean space. We use the Koszul complex to construct two families of finite\nelement differential forms, show that these can be arranged in subcomplexes of\nthe de Rham complex in numerous ways, and for each construct a bounded cochain\nprojection. The abstract theory therefore applies to give the stability and\nconvergence of finite element approximations of the Hodge Laplacian. Other\napplications are considered as well, especially to the equations of elasticity.\nBackground material is included to make the presentation self-contained for a\nvariety of readers. \n\n"}

The effective\ninteraction depends on the strength of the confinement enforcing the 1D motion\nof atoms; interaction may be further enhanced by superimposing an optical\nlattice on the trap potential. In the compressible state, we find that the\nsmooth variation of the gas density around the trap center leads to softening\nof the singular behavior of S(q,omega) at Lieb-1 mode compared to the behavior\npredicted for homogeneous 1D systems. Nevertheless, the density-averaged\nresponse remains a non-analytic function of q and omega at Lieb-1 mode in the\nlimit of weak trap confinement. The exponent of the power-law non-analyticity\nis modified due to the inhomogeneity in a universal way, and thus, bears\nunambiguously the information about the (homogeneous) Lieb-Liniger model.

As an application, we show that the following four objects are\nessentially same;\n  * conformally flat n-manifolds (n>=3) with admissible singular points\n  (i.e. admissible GCF-manifolds),\n  * frontals as hypersurfaces in the lightcone Q^{n+1}_+,\n  * frontals as hypersurfaces in the hyperbolic space H^{n+1},\n  * sapacelike frontals as hypersurfaces in the de Sitter space S^{n+1}_1.\n  Recently, the duality of conformally flat Riemannian manifolds was found by\nseveral geometers. In our setting, this duality can be explained via the\nexistence of a two-fold map of the congruent classes of admissible\nGCF-manifolds into that of frontals in H^{n+1}. It should be remarked that the\ndual conformally flat metric may have degenerate points even when the original\nconformally flat metric is positive definite. This is the reason why we\nconsider conformally flat manifolds with singular points. In fact, the duality\nis an involution on the set of admissible GCF-manifolds. The case n=2 requires\nan exceptional treatment, since any Riemannian 2-manifolds are conformally\nflat. At the end of this paper, we also determine the moduli space of isometric\nimmersions of a given simply connected Riemannian 2-manifold into the lightcone\nQ^{3}_+. \n\n"}

In a seemingly\nunrelated research direction, Dziuk [Lect Notes in Math, vol 1357 (1988)]\nanalyzed a class of nodal finite elements for the Laplace-Beltrami equation on\nsmooth 2-surfaces approximated by a piecewise-linear triangulation; Demlow\nlater extended this analysis [SIAM J Numer Anal, 47 (2009)] to 3-surfaces, as\nwell as to higher-order surface approximation. In this article, we bring these\nlines of research together, first developing a framework for the analysis of\nvariational crimes in abstract Hilbert complexes, and then applying this\nabstract framework to the setting of finite element exterior calculus on\nhypersurfaces. Our framework extends the work of Arnold, Falk, and Winther to\nproblems that violate their subcomplex assumption, allowing for the extension\nof finite element exterior calculus to approximate domains, most notably the\nHodge-de Rham complex on approximate manifolds.

The class of\nconformal Killing symmetric tensor fields of an arbitrary rank is a natural\ngeneralization of the class of conformal Killing vector fields, and appears in\ndifferent geometric and physical problems. A symmetric tensor field is a\ntrace-free field if the contraction of the field with the metric tensor is\nidentically equal to zero. On a Riemannian manifold of dimension at least\nthree, the space of trace-free conformal Killing symmetric tensor fields of\narbitrary rank is of a finite dimension. On a two-dimensional manifold, the\nspace can be of infinite dimension. Nevertheless, on a connected manifold of\nany dimension, a trace-free conformal Killing tensor field is uniquely\ndetermined by its $C^\\infty$-jet at any point. We prove the statement: On a\nconnected manifold, a trace-free conformal Killing tensor field is identically\nequal to zero if it vanishes on some hypersurface. This statement is a basis of\nthe theorem on decomposition of a symmetric tensor field on a compact\nRiemannian manifold with boundary to a sum of three fields such that the first\nsummand is a trace-free and divergence-free field, the second summand is a\npotential field with a trace-free potential vanishing on the boundary, and the\nlast summand is a multiple of the metric tensor.

The essence of Forward AD is to attach perturbations to\neach number, and propagate these through the computation. When derivatives are\nnested, the distinct derivative calculations, and their associated\nperturbations, must be distinguished. This is typically accomplished by\ncreating a unique tag for each derivative calculation, tagging the\nperturbations, and overloading the arithmetic operators. We exhibit a subtle\nbug, present in fielded implementations, in which perturbations are confused\ndespite the tagging machinery. The essence of the bug is this: each invocation\nof a derivative creates a unique tag but a unique tag is needed for each\nderivative calculation. When taking derivatives of higher-order functions,\nthese need not correspond! The derivative of a higher-order function $f$ that\nreturns a function $g$ will be a function $f'$ that returns a function\n$\\bar{g}$ that performs a derivative calculation.

By\nmeans of the numerical analysis and variational approximation, we demonstrate\nthat the two-component model of the Bose-Einstein condensate, with the\nspin-orbit Rashba coupling and cubic attractive interactions, gives rise to\nsolitary-vortex complexes of two types: semi-vortices (SVs, with a vortex in\none component and a fundamental soliton in the other), and mixed modes (MMs,\nwith topological charges 0 and +1/-1 mixed in both components). These two-\ndimensional composite modes can be created using the trapping\nharmonic-oscillator (HO) potential, but remain stable in the free space, if the\ntrap is gradually removed.

The latter is based on a correspondence between first order\ndifferential calculi and digraphs. Arrows originating from a vertex span its\n(co)tangent space. If the metric is to measure length and angles at some point,\nit has to be taken as an element of the left-linear tensor product of the space\nof 1-forms with itself, and not as an element of the (non-local) tensor product\nover the algebra of functions.
