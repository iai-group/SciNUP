We have performed a cluster analysis of the local\nextrema in the CMB signal to show that the CS is actually associated with a\nlarge group of extrema rather than just one. In the light of this we have\nre-examined the properties of the WMAP ILC and co-added \"cleaned\" WCM maps,\nwhich have previously been used for the analysis of the properties of the\nsignal in the vicinity of the CS. These two maps have remarkably similar\nproperties on equal latitude rings for |b|>30deg, as well as in the vicinity of\nthe CS. We have also checked the idea that the CMB signal has a non-Gaussian\ntail, localized in the low multipole components of the signal. For each ring we\napply a linear filter with characteristic scale R, dividing the CMB signal in\ntwo parts: the filtered part, with characteristic scale above that of the\nfilter R, and the difference between the initial and filtered signal. Using the\nfilter scale as a variable, we can maximize the skewness and kurtosis of the\nsmoothed signal and minimize these statistics for the difference between\ninitial and filtered signal. We have discovered that the shape of the CS is\nformed primarily by the components of the CMB signal represented by multipoles\nbetween 10<=L<=20, with a corresponding angular scale about 5-10 degs. This\nsignal leads to modulation of the whole CMB sky, clearly seen at |b|>30deg in\nboth the ILC and WCM maps, rather than a single localized feature. After\nsubtraction of this modulation, the remaining part of the CMB signal appears to\nbe consistent with statistical homogeneity and Gaussianity. \n\n"}

(I): The effective theory of inflation a la\nGinsburg-Landau (GL): the inflaton potential is a polynomial with universal\nform making explicit the inflation energy scale M, the Planck mass and the\ninflation e-folds number N ~ 60. The slow-roll expansion becomes a systematic\n1/N expansion and the inflaton couplings are naturally small as powers of\n(M/M_{Pl})^2. The spectral index (n_s - 1) and the ratio of tensor/scalar\nfluctuations r are O(1/N), the running index is O(1/N^2). M ~ 0.7 10^{16} GeV\nis completely determined by the scalar adiabatic fluctuations amplitude. (II):\nA Monte Carlo Markov Chains (MCMC) analysis of the CMB+LSS data (including\nWMAP5) with our analytic theoretical results yields: a lower bound for r (new\ninflation): r > 0.023 (95%CL), r > 0.046 (68%CL); the preferred inflation\npotential is a double well, even function of the field yielding as most\nprobable values n_s ~ 0.964, r ~ 0.051. This value for r is within reach of\nforthcoming CMB observations. Slow-roll inflation is generically preceded by a\nshort fast-roll stage which leads to a suppression of the CMB quadrupoles. MCMC\nanalysis of the WMAP+SDSS data shows that fast-roll fits the TT, TE and EE\nmodes well reproducing the quadrupole suppression and fixes the total number of\nefolds of inflation to be N_{total} ~ 64.

However, N-body\nsimulations show that dark matter halos grow through a mixture of smooth\naccretion, violent encounters and fragmentations, and modeling halo collapse as\nspherical, or even as ellipsoidal, is a significant oversimplification. We\npropose that some of the physical complications inherent to a realistic\ndescription of halo formation can be included in the excursion set theory\nframework, at least at an effective level, by taking into account that the\ncritical value for collapse is not a fixed constant $\\delta_c$, as in the\nspherical collapse model, nor a fixed function of the variance $\\sigma$ of the\nsmoothed density field, as in the ellipsoidal collapse model, but rather is\nitself a stochastic variable, whose scatter reflects a number of complicated\naspects of the underlying dynamics.

We developed\nULySS, a package to fit spectroscopic observations against a linear combination\nof non-linear model components convolved with a parametric line-of-sight\nvelocity distribution. The minimization can be either local or global, and\ndetermines all the parameters in a single fit.

We show the importance of determining the shape\nof the continuum simultaneously to the other parameters by including a\nmultiplicative polynomial in the model (without prior pseudo-continuum\ndetermination, or rectification of the spectrum). We also stress the benefice\nof using an accurate line-spread function, depending on the wavelength, so that\nthe line-shape of the models properly match the observation. For simple models,\ni. e., to measure the atmospheric parameters or the age/metallicity of a\nsingle-age stellar population, there is often a unique minimum, or when local\nminima exist they can unambiguously be recognized.

They are undetected in the\ndeep ACS images below 8500 A and have clear detections in the J and H bands.\nFits to the ACS, NICMOS and IRAC data yield robust photometric redshifts in the\nrange z~6-7 and largely rule out the possibility that they are low-redshift\ninterlopers. All three objects are extended, and resolved into a pair of bright\nknots. The bright i-band dropout in Abell 1703 has an H-band AB magnitude of\n23.9, which makes it one of the brightest known galaxy candidates at z>5.5. Our\nmodel fits suggest a young, massive galaxy only ~ 60 million years old with a\nmass of ~ 1E10 solar mass. The dropout galaxy candidates behind CL0024+16 are\nseparated by 2.5\" (~ 2 kpc in the source plane), and have H-band AB magnitudes\nof 25.0 and 25.6.

Such predictions are\nfrequently compared to the spectral energy distributions of observed galaxies\nvia the stellar population synthesis (SPS) technique. Substantial uncertainties\nin SPS exist, and yet their relevance to the task of comparing galaxy evolution\nmodels to observations has received little attention. In the present work we\nbegin to address this issue by investigating the importance of uncertainties in\nstellar evolution, the initial stellar mass function (IMF), and dust and\ninterstellar medium (ISM) properties on the translation from models to\nobservations. We demonstrate that these uncertainties translate into\nsubstantial uncertainties in the ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared colors\nof synthetic galaxies. Aspects that carry significant uncertainties include the\nlogarithmic slope of the IMF above 1 Msun, dust attenuation law, molecular\ncloud disruption timescale, clumpiness of the ISM, fraction of unobscured\nstarlight, and treatment of advanced stages of stellar evolution including blue\nstragglers, the horizontal branch, and the thermally-pulsating asymptotic giant\nbranch.

For the ICM, which\nis heated to X-ray radiating temperatures, X-ray spectroscopy is the most\nimportant tool to obtain insight into the structure and astrophysics of galaxy\nclusters. In this review we recall the basic principles of the interpretation\nof X-ray spectra from a hot, tenuous plasma and we illustrate the wide range of\nscientific applications of X-ray spectroscopy. The determination of galaxy\ncluster masses, important for cosmology, rest crucially on a precise\nspectroscopic ICM temperature determination. The study of the thermal structure\nof the ICM provides a very interesting fossil record of the energy release\nduring galaxy formation and evolution. The temperature and pressure\ndistribution of the ICM gives us important insight into the process of galaxy\ncluster merging and the dissipation of the merger energy in form of turbulent\nmotion. Cooling cores in the centers are interesting laboratories to\ninvestigate the interplay between gas cooling, star- and black hole formation\nand energy feedback, which is diagnosed by means of X-ray spectroscopy.

By studying the evolution of\nvarious components in the model, we find that, in the early stage of the\nuniverse, dark energy tracked the evolution of the radiation, i.e. $w_y \\to\n1/3$. However, in the late stage, $w_y$ naturally runs to the critical state\nwith $w_y = -1$, and the universe transits from matter-dominated into dark\nenergy dominated stage only at recently $z \\sim 0.3$. These characters are\nindependent of the choice of the initial condition, and the cosmic coincidence\nproblem is avoided in the models. We also find that, if the possible\ninteraction between YMC and dust matter is considered, the late time attractor\nsolution may exist.

The\nvelocity scale of thermal broadening and the Hubble flow across the gas Jeans\nscale are of similar magnitude (Hlambda_J ~ sigma_th). To separate the effects\nof gas pressure support and thermal broadening on the Lya forest, we compare\nspectra extracted from two smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations\nevolved with different photoionization heating rates (and thus different Jeans\nscales), imposing different temperature-density relations on the evolved\nparticle distributions. The turnover scales in the flux power spectrum and flux\nautocorrelation function are determined mainly by thermal broadening rather\nthan pressure. However, the insensitivity to pressure arises partly from a\ncancellation effect with a sloped temperature-density relation (T ~ rho^{0.6}\nin our simulations): the high density peaks in the colder, lower pressure\nsimulation are less smoothed by pressure support than in the hotter simulation,\nand it is this higher density gas that experiences the strongest thermal\nbroadening. Changes in thermal broadening and pressure support have comparably\nimportant effects on the flux probability distribution (PDF), which responds\ndirectly to the gas overdensity distribution rather than the scale on which it\nis smooth. Tests on a lower resolution simulation show that our statistical\nresults are converged even at this lower resolution.

This campaign involved AGILE, Spitzer,\nSwift,Suzaku,the WEBT consortium,the REM and MITSuME telescopes,offering a\nbroad band coverage that allowed for a simultaneous sampling of the synchrotron\nand inverse Compton (IC) emissions.The 2-week AGILE monitoring was accompanied\nby radio to optical monitoring by WEBT and REM and by sparse observations in\nmid-Infrared and soft/hard X-ray energy bands performed by means of Target of\nOpportunity observations by Spitzer, Swift and Suzaku, respectively.The source\nwas detected with an average flux of~250x10^{-8}ph cm^-2s^-1 above 100\nMeV,typical of its flaring states.The simultaneous optical and gamma-ray\nmonitoring allowed us to study the time-lag associated with the variability in\nthe two energy bands, resulting in a possible ~1-day delay of the gamma-ray\nemission with respect to the optical one.

The\nEoS is assumed to admit a future attractor that acts as an effective\ncosmological constant, while asymptotically in the past the pressure is\nnegligible. UDM models of the dark sector are appealing because they evade the\nso-called \"coincidence problem\" and \"predict\" what can be interpreted as\n$w_{\\rm DE} \\approx -1$, but in general suffer the effects of a non-negligible\nJeans scale that wreak havoc in the evolution of perturbations, causing a large\nIntegrated Sachs-Wolfe effect and/or changing structure formation at small\nscales.

Keck\nspectroscopy is used to estimate black hole mass (M_BH). We study the cosmic\nevolution of the M_BH-spheroid luminosity (L_sph) relation. In combination with\nour previous work, totaling 40 Seyfert-1 galaxies, the covered range in BH mass\nis substantially increased, allowing us to determine for the first time\nintrinsic scatter and correct evolutionary trends for selection effects. We\nre-analyze archival HST images of 19 local reverberation-mapped active galaxies\nto match the procedure adopted at intermediate redshift. Correcting spheroid\nluminosity for passive luminosity evolution and taking into account selection\neffects, we determine that at fixed present-day V-band spheroid luminosity,\nM_BH/L_sph \\propto (1+z)^(2.8+/-1.2). When including a sample of 44 quasars out\nto z=4.5 taken from the literature, with luminosity and BH mass corrected to a\nself-consistent calibration, we extend the BH mass range to over two orders of\nmagnitude, resulting in M_BH/L_sph \\propto (1+z)^(1.4+/-0.2). The intrinsic\nscatter of the relation, assumed constant with redshift, is 0.3+/-0.1 dex (<0.6\ndex at 95% CL). The evolutionary trend suggests that BH growth precedes\nspheroid assembly. Interestingly, the M_BH-total host-galaxy luminosity\nrelation is apparently non-evolving. It hints at either a more fundamental\nrelation or that the spheroid grows by a redistribution of stars. However, the\nhigh-z sample does not follow this relation, indicating that major mergers may\nplay the dominant role in growing spheroids above z~1. \n\n"}

Abstract: We use multi-scale SPH simulations to follow the inflow of gas from galactic\nscales to <0.1pc, where the gas begins to resemble a traditional Keplerian\naccretion disk. The key ingredients are gas, stars, black holes (BHs),\nself-gravity, star formation, and stellar feedback. We use ~100 simulations to\nsurvey a large parameter space of galaxy properties and subgrid models for the\nISM physics. We generate initial conditions for our simulations of galactic\nnuclei (<~300pc) using galaxy scale simulations, including both major mergers\nand isolated bar-(un)stable disk galaxies. For sufficiently gas-rich,\ndisk-dominated systems, a series of gravitational instabilities generates large\naccretion rates of up to 1-10 M_sun/yr onto the BH (at <<0.1pc); sufficient to\nfuel the most luminous quasars. The BH accretion rate is highly time variable,\ngiven fixed conditions at ~kpc. At >~10pc, our simulations resemble the 'bars\nwithin bars' model, but the gas exhibits diverse morphologies, including\nspirals, rings, clumps, and bars; their duty cycle is modest, complicating\nattempts to correlate BH accretion with nuclear morphology. At ~1-10pc, the\ngravitational potential becomes dominated by the BH and bar-like modes are no\nlonger present. However, the gas becomes unstable to a standing, eccentric disk\nor a single-armed spiral mode (m=1), driving the gas to sub-pc scales. Proper\ntreatment of this mode requires including star formation and the self-gravity\nof both the stars and gas. We predict correlations between BHAR and SFR at\ndifferent galactic nuclei: nuclear SF is more tightly coupled to AGN activity,\nbut correlations exist at all scales. \n\n"}

The\nULIRGs are on average 1 magnitude brighter in M0.1r than the SDSS galaxies\nwithin the same redshift range.

Our results for natural (O(1))\nvalues of parameters in the Lagrangian which lead to a background expansion\nsimilar to LCDM are summarized as follows: 1. Scalar-Tensor dark energy density\nperturbations are amplified by a factor of about 10^6 compared to minimally\ncoupled quintessence perturbations on scales less than about 100 h^{-1} Mpc. On\nthese scales dark energy perturbations constitute a fraction of about 10%\ncompared to matter density perturbations. 2. Scalar-Tensor dark energy density\nperturbations are anti-correlated with matter linear perturbations on\nsub-Hubble scales. Thus clusters of galaxies are predicted to overlap with\nvoids of dark energy. 3. This anti-correlation of matter with negative pressure\nperturbations induces a mild amplification of matter perturbations by about 10%\non sub-Hubble scales. 4. The evolution of scalar field perturbations on\nsub-Hubble scales, is scale independent and therefore it corresponds to a\nvanishing effective speed of sound (c_{s\\Phi}=0). It also involves large\noscillations at early times induced by the amplified effective mass of the\nfield. This amplification is due to the non-minimal coupling of the field to\nthe Ricci curvature scalar and (thus) to matter.

MOND effects are\nabsent in an exactly symmetric universe, apart from the appearance of a\ncosmological constant, Lambda~(a0/c)^2. MOND effects-local and cosmological-do\nenter when density inhomogeneities that differ in the two sectors appear and\ndevelop. MOND later takes its standard form in systems that are islands\ndominated by pure matter. I derive the nonrelativistic equations governing\nsmall-scale fluctuation growth. The equations split into two uncoupled systems,\none for the sum, the other for the difference, of the fluctuations in the two\nsectors. The former is governed strictly by Newtonian dynamics. The latter is\ngoverned by MOND dynamics, which entails stronger gravity, and nonlinearity\neven for the smallest of perturbations. These cause the difference to grow\nfaster than the sum, conducing to matter-twin-matter segregation. The\nnonlinearity also causes interaction between nested perturbations on different\nscales. Because matter and twin matter (TM) repel each other in the MOND\nregime, matter inhomogeneities grow not only by their own self gravity, but\nalso through shepherding by flanking TM overdensitie.

Assuming that all emission-line light curves are scaled, smoothed, and\ndisplaced versions of the continuum, this alternative approach fits the light\ncurves directly using a damped random walk model and aligns them to recover the\ntime lag and its statistical confidence limits. We introduce the mathematical\nformalism of this approach and demonstrate its ability to cope with some of the\nproblems for traditional methods, such as irregular sampling, correlated\nerrors, and seasonal gaps. We redetermine the lags for 87 emission lines in 31\nquasars and reassess the BLR size--luminosity relationship using 60 H-beta\nlags. We confirm the general results from the traditional cross-correlation\nmethods, with a few exceptions. Our method, however, also supports a broad\nrange of extensions. In particular, it can simultaneously fit multiple lines\nand continuum light curves which improves the lag estimate for the lines and\nprovides estimates of the error correlations between them. Determining these\ncorrelations is of particular importance for interpreting emission-line\nvelocity--delay maps. We can also include parameters for luminosity-dependent\nlags or line responses.

The new version keeps all advantages of\nthe original implementation: photons are transported at the speed of light, in\na photon-conserving manner, directly on the spatially adaptive, unstructured\ngrid traced out by the particles, in a computation time that is independent of\nthe number of radiation sources, and in parallel on distributed memory\nmachines.

The most compelling evidence that cold gas plays a role in fueling\nradio galaxies is that dust is detected more commonly and/or in larger\nquantities in (elliptical) radio galaxies compared with radio-quiet elliptical\ngalaxies. On the other hand, only small numbers of radio galaxies have yet been\ndetected in CO (and even fewer imaged), and whether or not all radio galaxies\nhave enough cold gas to fuel their jets remains an open question.

It has been proposed that MHD\nturbulence, generated during cluster-cluster mergers, may be a source of\nparticle reacceleration in the IGM. Calculations of turbulent acceleration must\naccount self-consistently for the complex non--linear coupling between\nturbulent waves and particles. This has been calculated in some detail under\nthe assumption that turbulence interacts in a collisionless way with the IGM.\nIn this paper we explore a different picture of acceleration by compressible\nturbulence in galaxy clusters, where the interaction between turbulence and the\nIGM is mediated by plasma instabilities and maintained collisional at scales\nmuch smaller than the Coulomb mean free path. In this regime most of the energy\nof fast modes is channeled into the reacceleration of relativistic particles\nand the acceleration process approaches a universal behaviour being\nself-regulated by the back-reaction of the accelerated particles on turbulence\nitself.

We argue that such a spatial\nordering should be reflected in the angular cross-correlation (CC, in polar\ncoordinates) using all azimuthal positions among pairs of these tracers; the\npeak of the CC should be offset from zero, in different directions inside and\noutside the corotation radius. Recent spiral SF simulations by Dobbs & Pringle,\nshow explicitly that for the case of a stationary spiral arm potential such\nangular offsets between gas and young stars of differing ages should be\nobservable as cross-correlation offsets.

In this work, we\nuse cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to model the impact of this blazar\nheating on the Lyman-alpha forest at redshifts z~2-3. We find that blazar\nheating produces an inverted temperature-density relation in the IGM and\nnaturally resolves many of the problems present in previous simulations of the\nforest that included photoheating alone. In particular, our simulations with\nblazar heating simultaneously reproduce the observed effective optical depth\nand temperature as a function of redshift, the observed probability\ndistribution functions of the transmitted flux, and the observed flux power\nspectra, over the full redshift range 2<z<3 analysed here. Additionally, by\ndeblending the Lyman-alpha forest into a sum of thermally broadened individual\nlines, we find superb agreement with the observed lower cutoff of the\nline-width distribution and abundances of neutral hydrogen column densities.\nUsing the most recent constraints on the cosmic ultraviolet (UV) background,\nthis excellent agreement with observations does not require rescaling the\namplitude of the UV background; a procedure that was routinely used in the past\nto match the observed level of transmitted flux.

These\ncorrelations are induced by realistic smoothing filters (as opposed to a filter\nthat is sharp in k-space), but have been ignored by many analyses to date. We\npresent analytical arguments -- building on existing results for Gaussian\ninitial conditions -- which suggest that the effect of the filter at large\nsmoothing scales is remarkably simple, and is in fact identical to what happens\nin the Gaussian case: the non-Gaussian walks behave as if they were smooth and\ndeterministic, or \"completely correlated\". As a result, the first crossing\ndistribution (which determines, e.g., halo abundances) follows from the\nsingle-scale statistics of the non-Gaussian density field -- the so-called\n\"cloud-in-cloud\" problem does not exist for completely correlated walks. Also,\nthe answer from single-scale statistics is simply one half that for sharp-k\nwalks. We explicitly test these arguments using Monte Carlo simulations of\nnon-Gaussian walks, showing that the resulting first crossing distributions,\nand in particular the factor 1/2 argument, are remarkably insensitive to\nvariations in the power spectrum and the defining non-Gaussian process. We also\nuse our Monte Carlo walks to test some of the existing prescriptions for the\nnon-Gaussian first crossing distribution.

Charged black holes in\nf(R) gravity can have a new type of singularity due to higher curvature\ncorrections, the so-called f(R)-induced singularity, although it is highly\nmodel-dependent.

Weak gravitational lensing is a\npromising tool for, on average, unbiased mass estimates. This weak lensing\nproject aims at measuring reliable weak lensing masses for a complete X-ray\nselected sample of 36 high redshift (0.35<z<0.9) clusters.

When using clusters for cosmology,\nthe crucial assumption is that they are relaxed. However, subarcminute\nresolution Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect images compared with high resolution\nX-ray images of some clusters show significant offsets between the two peaks.\nWe have carried out self-consistent N-body/hydrodynamical simulations of\nmerging galaxy clusters using FLASH to study these offsets quantitatively. We\nhave found that significant displacements result between the SZ and X-ray peaks\nfor large relative velocities for all masses used in our simulations as long as\nthe impact parameters were about 100-250 kpc. Our results suggest that the SZ\npeak coincides with the peak in the pressure times the line-of-sight\ncharacteristic length and not the pressure maximum (as it would for clusters in\nequilibrium). The peak in the X-ray emission, as expected, coincides with the\ndensity maximum of the main cluster.

We use the technique of\nchemical tagging to identify stars that are highly clustered in a\nmulti-dimensional chemical abundance space (C-space). In a sample of six stars,\nthree, possibly four stars are identified as potential cluster stars. The\ninitial stellar mass of the parent cluster is estimated from two independent\nobservations to M*,init=1.9^{+1.5}_{-0.9} (1.6^{+1.2}_{-0.8}) x 10^5 M_sol,\nassuming a Salpeter (Kroupa) initial mass function (IMF).

The former result from\nthe direct collapse of gas in T_s^h >1.5x10^4K, H_2-free halos; the latter are\nthe endproduct of a standard H_2-based star formation process. The H_2-free\ncondition is attained by exposing halos to a strong (J_21 > 10^3) Lyman-Werner\nUV background produced by both accreting BHs and stars, thus establishing a\nself-regulated growth regime. We find that this condition is met already at z\nclose to 18 in the highly biased regions in which quasars are born. The key\nparameter allowing the formation of SMBHs by z=6-7 is the fraction of halos\nthat can form heavy seeds: the minimum requirement is that f_heavy>0.001; SMBH\nas large as 2x10^10 Msol can be obtained when f_heavy approaches unity.\nIndependently of f_heavy, the model produces a high-z stellar bulge-black hole\nmass relation which is steeper than the local one, implying that SMBHs formed\nbefore their bulge was in place. The formation of heavy seeds, allowed by the\nLyman-Werner radiative feedback in the quasar-forming environment, is crucial\nto achieve a fast growth of the SMBH by merger events in the early phases of\nits evolution, i.e. z>7.

However, even after perfect foregrounds\nremoval, our ignorance on the background reionization history can significantly\naffect the cosmological parameter estimation. In particular, the\ninterdependence between the hydrogen ionized fraction, the baryon density and\nthe optical depth to the redshift of observation induce nontrivial degeneracies\nbetween the cosmological parameters that have not been considered so far. Using\na simple, but consistent reionization model, we revisit their expected\nconstraints for a futuristic giant 21-cm omniscope by using for the first time\nMarkov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods on multiredshift full sky simulated\ndata.

Because of the young age of the progenitors, the ejecta may\neventually interact with the circumstellar medium (CSM) via highly energetic\nprocesses detectable in the radio, X-ray, ultraviolet (UV) and, sometimes, in\nthe optical domains. In this paper we present ultraviolet, optical and near\ninfrared observations of five type II SNe, namely SNe 2009dd, 2007pk, 2010aj,\n1995ad, and 1996W. Together with few other SNe they form a group of moderately\nluminous type II events. We collected photometry and spectroscopy with several\ntelescopes in order to construct well-sampled light curves and spectral\nevolutions from the photospheric to the nebular phases. Both photometry and\nspectroscopy indicate a degree of heterogeneity in this sample. The light\ncurves have luminous peak magnitudes ($-16.95<M_{B}<-18.70$).

These phenomena\nare a direct consequence of the zero rest mass of gravitons, conformal\nnon-invariance of the graviton field, and one-loop finiteness of quantum\ngravity. The effects are due to graviton-ghost condensates arising from the\ninterference of quantum coherent states. Each of coherent states is a state of\ngravitons and ghosts of a wavelength of the order of the horizon scale and of\ndifferent occupation numbers. The state vector of the Universe is a coherent\nsuperposition of vectors of different occupation numbers. To substantiate the\nreliability of macroscopic quantum effects, the formalism of one-loop quantum\ngravity is discussed in detail. The theory is constructed as follows:\nFaddeev-Popov path integral in Hamilton gauge -> factorization of classical and\nquantum variables, allowing the existence of a self-consistent system of\nequations for gravitons, ghosts and macroscopic geometry -> transition to the\none-loop approximation. The ghost sector corresponding to the Hamilton gauge\nensures of one-loop finiteness of the theory off the mass shell. The\nBogolyubov-Born-Green-Kirckwood-Yvon (BBGKY) chain for the spectral function of\ngravitons renormalized by ghosts is used to build a self-consistent theory of\ngravitons in the isotropic Universe. We found three exact solutions of the\nequations, consisting of BBGKY chain and macroscopic Einstein's equations. The\nsolutions describe virtual graviton, ghost, and instanton condensates and are\nreproduced at the level of exact solutions for field operators and state\nvectors. Each exact solution corresponds to a certain phase state of\ngraviton-ghost substratum. We establish conditions under which a continuous\nquantum-gravity phase transitions occur between different phases of the\ngraviton-ghost condensate. \n\n"}

For transit telescopes such as PAPER, calibration of the\nprimary beam is a difficult endeavor, and errors in this calibration are a\nmajor source of error in the determination of source spectra. In order to\ndecrease reliance on accurate beam calibration, we focus on calibrating sources\nin a narrow declination range from -46d to -40d. Since sources at similar\ndeclinations follow nearly identical paths through the primary beam, this\nrestriction greatly reduces errors associated with beam calibration, yielding a\ndramatic improvement in the accuracy of derived source spectra. Extrapolating\nfrom higher frequency catalogs, we derive the flux scale using a Monte-Carlo\nfit across multiple sources that includes uncertainty from both catalog and\nmeasurement errors. Fitting spectral models to catalog data and these new PAPER\nmeasurements, we derive new flux models for Pictor A and 31 other sources at\nnearby declinations. 90% of these confirm and refine a power-law model for flux\ndensity.

We find\nthat Pop III stars and quasars produce a smooth transition from an ionized and\nhot state to a neutral and cold one, owing to their hard spectral energy\ndistribution with abundant ionizing photons, in contrast to the sharp\ntransition in galaxies. Furthermore, Lya scattering plays a dominant role in\nproducing the 21 cm signal as it determines the relation between hydrogen spin\ntemperature and gas kinetic temperature.

For example, many models predict a slightly\nblue spectrum and must be fine-tuned to generate a red spectral index; as a\nside effect, large non-Gaussianities often result.\n  We highlight several promising attempts to violate the NEC without\nintroducing dangerous instabilities at the classical and/or quantum level. If\nprimordial gravitational waves are observed, certain bouncing cosmologies, such\nas the cyclic scenario, are in trouble, while others remain valid. We conclude\nthat, while most bouncing cosmologies are far from providing an alternative to\nthe inflationary paradigm, a handful of interesting proposals have surfaced,\nwhich warrant further research.

One possibility is the so-called\n\"chameleon\" mechanism, which renders an effective mass depending on the local\nmatter density.

This is also the case if dark matter can be treated as a\nself-gravitating collisionless gas experiencing Lynden-Bell's type of violent\nrelaxation. In order to avoid the infinite mass problem and carry out a\nrigorous stability analysis, we consider the fermionic King model. In this\npaper, we study the non-degenerate limit leading to the classical King model.\nThis model was initially introduced to describe globular clusters. We propose\nto apply it also to large dark matter halos where quantum effects are\nnegligible. We determine the caloric curve and study the thermodynamical\nstability of the different configurations. Equilibrium states exist only above\na critical energy $E_c$ in the microcanonical ensemble and only above a\ncritical temperature $T_c$ in the canonical ensemble. For $E<E_c$, the system\nundergoes a gravothermal catastrophe and, for $T<T_c$, it undergoes an\nisothermal collapse. We compute the profiles of density, circular velocity, and\nvelocity dispersion. We compare the prediction of the classical King model to\nthe observations of large dark matter halos. Because of collisions and\nevaporation, the central density increases while the slope of the halo density\nprofile decreases until an instability takes place. We show that large dark\nmatter halos are relatively well-described by the King model at, or close to,\nthe point of marginal microcanonical stability. At that point, the King model\ngenerates a density profile that can be approximated by the modified Hubble\nprofile.

These\ndeconvolution algorithms produce a single image that is assumed to be a true\nrepresentation of the sky, when in fact it is just one realization of an\ninfinite ensemble of images compatible with the noise in the data. In contrast,\nhere we report a Bayesian formalism that simultaneously infers both systematics\nand science.

Unlike the GL grid,\nhowever, the number of grid points per ring varies as a function of latitude,\navoiding expensive over-sampling near the poles and ensuring nearly equal sky\narea per grid point. The ratio between the number of grid points in two\nneighbouring rings is required to be a low-order rational number (3, 2, 1, 4/3,\n5/4 or 6/5) to maintain a high degree of symmetries. Our main motivation for\nthis grid is to solve linear systems using multi-grid methods, and to construct\nefficient preconditioners through pixel-space sampling of the linear operator\nin question.

All four lens systems were modeled with PixeLens, Lenstool, glafic,\nand Lensmodel. The input data and parameterization of each lens model was\nsimilar for the four model programs used to highlight differences in the output\nresults. The calculation of the Einstein radius and enclosed mass for each lens\nmodel was comparable. The results were more dissimilar if the masses of more\nthan one lens potential were free-parameters.

Abstract: We investigate the quantumness of primordial cosmological fluctuations and\nits detectability. The quantum discord of inflationary perturbations is\ncalculated for an arbitrary splitting of the system, and shown to be very large\non super-Hubble scales. This entails the presence of large quantum\ncorrelations, due to the entangled production of particles with opposite\nmomentums during inflation. To determine how this is reflected at the\nobservational level, we study whether quantum correlators can be reproduced by\na non-discordant state, i.e. a state with vanishing discord that contains\nclassical correlations only. We demonstrate that this can be done for the power\nspectrum, the price to pay being twofold: first, large errors in other\ntwo-point correlation functions and second, the presence of intrinsic\nnon-Gaussianity. The detectability of these two features remains to be\ndetermined but could possibly rule out a non-discordant description of the\ncosmic microwave background. If one abandons the idea that perturbations should\nbe modeled by quantum mechanics and wants to use a classical stochastic\nformalism instead, we show that any two-point correlators on super-Hubble\nscales can be exactly reproduced regardless of the squeezing of the system. The\nlatter becomes important only for higher-order correlation functions that can\nbe accurately reproduced only in the strong squeezing regime. \n\n"}

Using shape\nand amplitude correlators, we directly compare simulated data with theoretical\nmodels over the full three-dimensional domain of the bispectrum, for different\nredshifts and scales.

Simple theories of isothermal fragmentation successfully\nreproduce the core mass function (CMF) which has a very similar shape to the\ninitial mass function (IMF) of stars. However, numerical simulations of\nisothermal turbulent fragmentation thus far have not succeeded in identifying a\nfragment mass scale that is independent of the simulation resolution. Moreover,\nthe fluid equations for magnetized, self-gravitating, isothermal turbulence are\nscale-free, and do not predict any characteristic mass. In this paper we show\nthat, although an isothermal self-gravitating flow does produce a CMF with a\nmass scale imposed by the initial conditions, this scale changes as the parent\ncloud evolves. In addition, the cores that form undergo further fragmentation\nand after sufficient time forget about their initial conditions, yielding a\nscale-free pure power-law distribution $\\mathrm{d} N/\\mathrm{d} M\\propto\nM^{-2}$ for the stellar IMF. We show that this problem can be alleviated by\nintroducing additional physics that provides a termination scale for the\ncascade.

We consider the case of surveys for high-redshift\nLyman-alpha-emitting galaxies (LAEs), which have traditionally been classified\nvia an inferred rest-frame equivalent width (EW) greater than 20 angstrom. Our\nBayesian method relies on known prior probabilities in measured emission-line\nluminosity functions and equivalent width distributions for the galaxy\npopulations, and returns the probability that an object in question is an LAE\ngiven the characteristics observed. This approach will be directly relevant for\nthe Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX), which seeks to\nclassify ~10^6 emission-line galaxies into LAEs and low-redshift [O II]\nemitters. For a simulated HETDEX catalog with realistic measurement noise, our\nBayesian method recovers 86% of LAEs missed by the traditional EW > 20 angstrom\ncutoff over 2 < z < 3, outperforming the EW cut in both contamination and\nincompleteness. This is due to the method's ability to trade off between the\ntwo types of binary classification error by adjusting the stringency of the\nprobability requirement for classifying an observed object as an LAE. In our\nsimulations of HETDEX, this method reduces the uncertainty in cosmological\ndistance measurements by 14% with respect to the EW cut, equivalent to\nrecovering 29% more cosmological information.

By its completion the survey is expected to have generated a\ncatalogue of 300 million galaxies with photometric redshifts and 100 million\nstars. In addition, a time-domain survey search over 27 sq deg is expected to\nyield a sample of thousands of Type Ia supernovae and other transients. The\nmain goals of DES are to characterise dark energy and dark matter, and to test\nalternative models of gravity; these goals will be pursued by studying large\nscale structure, cluster counts, weak gravitational lensing and Type Ia\nsupernovae. However, DES also provides a rich data set which allows us to study\nmany other aspects of astrophysics. In this paper we focus on additional\nscience with DES, emphasizing areas where the survey makes a difference with\nrespect to other current surveys.

Because of its optimal properties, one of the\nmost popular and widely-used detection technique is the matched filter (MF).\nThis is a linear filter designed to maximise the detectability of a signal of\nknown structure that is buried in additive Gaussian random noise. In this work\nwe show that in the very common situation where the number and position of the\nsearched signals within a data sequence (e.g. an emission line in a spectrum)\nor an image (e.g. a point-source in an interferometric map) are unknown, this\ntechnique, when applied in its standard form, may severely underestimate the\nprobability of false detection.

Using\nnon-cosmological controlled simulations, we observe that temporal variations in\nthe gravitational potential caused by major mergers lead to a shallowing of the\ninner profile. This transformation is more significant for shallower initial\nprofiles and for a higher number of merging systems. Depending on the merger\ndetails, the resulting profiles can be shallower or steeper than NFW in their\ninner regions. Interestingly, mergers have a much weaker effect when the\nprofile is given by a broken power-law with an inner slope of $-1$ (such as NFW\nor Hernquist profiles).

However, we have\nlimited understanding of its physics and distribution in all but the nearest\ngalaxies. We present a new technique for studying the composition and\ndistribution of molecular gas in high-redshift galaxies inaccessible to\nexisting methods. Our proposed approach is an extension of carbon monoxide\nintensity mapping methods, which have garnered significant experimental\ninterest in recent years. These intensity mapping surveys target the 115 GHz\n$^{12}$CO (1-0) line, but also contain emission from the substantially fainter\n110 GHz $^{13}$CO (1-0) transition. The method leverages the information\ncontained in the $^{13}$CO line by cross-correlating pairs of frequency\nchannels in an intensity mapping survey. Since $^{13}$CO is emitted from the\nsame medium as the $^{12}$CO, but saturates at a much higher column density,\nthis cross-correlation provides valuable information about both the gas density\ndistribution and isotopologue ratio, inaccessible from the $^{12}$CO alone.\nUsing a simple model of these molecular emission lines, we show that a future\nintensity mapping survey can constrain the abundance ratio of these two species\nand the fraction of emission from optically thick regions to order $\\sim30\\%$.\nThese measurements cannot be made by traditional CO observations, and\nconsequently the proposed method will provide unique insight into the physics\nof star formation, feedback, and galactic ecology at high redshifts. \n\n"}

This formula cannot be used to\ncalculate the gravitational field of disk galaxies, with their rich MOND\nphenomenology. Notably, it cannot predict their rotation curves, except\nasymptotically.

Since the squeezed-limit bispectrum encodes the impact of a\nlarge-scale fluctuation on the small-scale power spectrum, it can be understood\nas how the small-scale power spectrum \"responds\" to the large-scale\nfluctuation. Viewed in this way, the squeezed-limit bispectrum can be\ncalculated using the response approach even in the cases which do not submit to\nperturbative treatment. To illustrate this point, we apply this approach to the\ncross-correlation between the large-scale quasar density field and small-scale\nLyman-$\\alpha$ forest flux power spectrum. In particular, using separate\nuniverse simulations which implement changes in the large-scale density,\nvelocity gradient, and primordial power spectrum amplitude, we measure how the\nLyman-$\\alpha$ forest flux power spectrum responds to the local,\nlong-wavelength quasar overdensity, and equivalently their squeezed-limit\nbispectrum. We perform a Fisher forecast for the ability of future experiments\nto constrain local non-Gaussianity using the bispectrum of quasars and the\nLyman-$\\alpha$ forest.

They generate strong shocks in the ambient medium, associated with\nobserved hotspots, and carve cavities that are filled with the shocked jet\nflow. In this Letter, we compare the pressure evolution in the hotspot and the\ncavity generated by relativistic and classical jets. Our results show that the\nclassical approach underestimates the cavity pressure by a factor larger or\nequal to 2 for a given shocked volume during the whole active phase. The\ntension between both approaches can only be alleviated by unrealistic jet flow\ndensities or gigantic jet areas in the classical case. As a consequence, the\nefficiency of a relativistic jet heating the ambient is typically around 20%\nlarger compared with a classical jet, and the heated volume is 2 to 10 times\nlarger during the time evolution.

Recent results from\nthe Planck satellite collaboration claim significant evidence for a\ndecorrelation in the polarization signal of the spatial pattern of galactic\ndust between 353 GHz and 217 GHz. Such a decorrelation would suppress power in\nthe cross spectrum between high frequency maps, where the dust is strong, and\nlower frequency maps, where the sensitivity to cosmological $B$-modes is\nstrongest. Alternatively, it would leave residuals in lower frequency maps\ncleaned with a template derived from the higher frequency maps.

Abstract: Recently there has been much interest in light dark matter, especially\nultra-light axions, as they may provide a solution to the core-cusp problem at\nthe center of galaxies. Since very light bosons can have a de Broglie\nwavelength that is of astrophysical size, they can smooth out the centers of\ngalaxies to produce a core, as opposed to vanilla dark matter models, and so it\nhas been suggested that this solves the core-cusp problem. In this work, we\ncritically examine this claim. While an ultra-light particle will indeed lead\nto a core, we examine whether the relationship between the density of the core\nand its radius matches the data over a range of galaxies. We first review data\nthat shows the core density of a galaxy $\\rho_c$ varies as a function of the\ncore radius $R_c$ as $\\rho_c\\propto1/R_c^\\beta$ with $\\beta\\approx1$. We then\ncompare this to theoretical models. We examine a large class of light scalar\ndark matter models, governed by some potential $V$. For simplicity, we take the\nscalar to be complex with a global $U(1)$ symmetry in order to readily organize\nsolutions by a conserved particle number. However, we expect our central\nconclusions to persist even for a real scalar, and furthermore, a complex\nscalar matches the behavior of a real scalar in the non-relativistic limit,\nwhich is the standard regime of interest. For any potential $V$, we find the\nrelationship between $\\rho_c$ and $R_c$ for ground state solutions is always in\none of the following regimes: (i) $\\beta\\gg1$, or (ii) $\\beta\\ll1$, or (iii)\nunstable, and so it never matches the data. We also find similar conclusions\nfor virialized dark matter, more general scalar field theories, degenerate\nfermion dark matter, superfluid dark matter, and general polytropes. We\nconclude that the solution to the core-cusp problem is more likely due to\neither complicated baryonic effects or some other type of dark matter\ninteractions. \n\n"}

We extend this to include a monodromy for the axion, and\ndemonstrate that in both cases an observable level of gravitational waves is\nproduced in small field inflation in string theory, with a spectrum that is\nmaximally chiral. Finally, we demonstrate the consistency with moduli\nstabilization and with arbitrary (large or small field) inflationary dynamics\nof the host model, considering as an explicit example Kahler Moduli Inflation. \n\n"}

Here we review the physics of the 21 cm\ntransition, focusing on processes relevant at high redshifts, and describe the\ninsights to be gained from such observations. These include measuring the\nmatter power spectrum at z~50, observing the formation of the cosmic web and\nthe first luminous sources, and mapping the reionization of the intergalactic\nmedium. The epoch of reionization is of particular interest, because large HII\nregions will seed substantial fluctuations in the 21 cm background. We also\ndiscuss the experimental challenges involved in detecting this signal, with an\nemphasis on the Galactic and extragalactic foregrounds. These increase rapidly\ntoward low frequencies and are especially severe for the highest redshift\napplications. Assuming that these difficulties can be overcome, the redshifted\n21 cm line will offer unique insight into the high-redshift Universe,\ncomplementing other probes but providing the only direct, three-dimensional\nview of structure formation from z~200 to z~6. \n\n"}

We calculate the magnitude of this effect by evolving the\nradiative transfer equations for the microwave background polarization through\nthe epoch of last scatter, in the presence of a magnetic field. For a\nprimordial field amplitude corresponding to a present value of $10^{-9}{\\rm G}$\n(which would account for the observed galactic field if it were frozen in the\npre-galactic plasma), we find a rotation angle of around $1^\\circ$ at a\nfrequency of 30 GHz. The statistical detection of this signal is feasible with\nfuture maps of the microwave background. \n\n"}

The degree of linear polarization of the\nCMB is significantly reduced at frequencies around and below 30 GHz $(B_*\n/10^{-2}{\\rm Gauss})^{1/2}$, where $B_*$ is the value of the primordial field\nat recombination. The depolarizing mechanism reduces the damping of\nanisotropies due to photon diffusion on small angular scales. The $l\\approx\n1000$ multipoles of the CMB temperature anisotropy correlation function in a\nstandard cold dark matter cosmology increase by up to 7.5\\% at frequencies\nwhere depolarization is significant. \n\n"}

As in the case\nof temperature spectrum gravitational lensing leads to smoothing of narrow\nfeatures and enhancement of power on the damping tail of the power spectrum.\nBecause acoustic peaks in polarization spectra are narrower than in the\ntemperature spectrum the smoothing effect is significantly larger and can reach\nup to 10\\% for $l<1000$ and even more above that.
