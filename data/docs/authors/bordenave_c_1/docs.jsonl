Then the variance of the interface height w.r.t. the Gibbs\nmeasure stays bounded uniformly in the volume for any positive pinning force\nand diverges like the logarithm of the pinning force when it tends to zero.\n  How does the presence of a quenched disorder term in the Hamiltonian modify\nthis transition?

IPMs have thus far mostly been used in\nmore abstract settings, for instance as theoretical tools in mass\ntransportation problems, and in metrizing the weak topology on the set of all\nBorel probability measures defined on a metric space. Practical applications of\nIPMs are less common, with some exceptions in the kernel machines literature.\nThe present work contributes a number of novel properties of IPMs, which should\ncontribute to making IPMs more widely used in practice, for instance in areas\nwhere $\\phi$-divergences are currently popular.\n  First, to understand the relation between IPMs and $\\phi$-divergences, the\nnecessary and sufficient conditions under which these classes intersect are\nderived: the total variation distance is shown to be the only non-trivial\n$\\phi$-divergence that is also an IPM. This shows that IPMs are essentially\ndifferent from $\\phi$-divergences. Second, empirical estimates of several IPMs\nfrom finite i.i.d. samples are obtained, and their consistency and convergence\nrates are analyzed.

In addition, the smoothness of an appropriate binary classifier is\nproved to be inversely related to the distance between the class-conditional\ndistributions, measured in terms of an IPM. \n\n"}

We give an\nasymptotically optimal analysis of this test, and show that it rejects\nfunctions that are (even only) Omega(2^{-d})-far with Omega(1)-probability (so\nthe rejection probability is a universal constant independent of d and n). This\nimplies a tight relationship between the (d+1)st Gowers norm of a function and\nits maximal correlation with degree d polynomials, when the correlation is\nclose to 1. Our proof works by induction on n and yields a new analysis of even\nthe classical Blum-Luby-Rubinfeld [BLR93] linearity test, for the setting of\nfunctions mapping F_2^n to F_2.

Since this seminal work of\nErd\\H{o}s and R\\'{e}nyi, various random graph models have been introduced and\nstudied.

At each step two random edges are\npresent and if the first edge would join two isolated vertices, it is added to\na graph; otherwise the second edge is added.

Both the random environment and the\nrandom arrival rate of each DSRP are driven by a finite state continuous time\nMarkov chain (FS-CTMC). Whereas the scheduling policy optimizes in a greedy\nfashion with respect to each queue and environmental state and since the\nclosed-form solution for the performance of such a queueing system under the\npolicy is difficult to obtain, we establish a reflecting diffusion with\nregime-switching (RDRS) model for its measures of performance and justify its\nasymptotic optimality through deriving the stochastic fluid and diffusion\nlimits for the corresponding system under heavy traffic and identifying a cost\nfunction related to the utility function, which is minimized through minimizing\nthe workload process in the diffusion limit.

How to best adapt is key to two-way communication, rendering it\nchallenging. However, examples exist of point-to-point channels where\nadaptation is not beneficial from a capacity perspective. We ask whether\nanalogous examples exist for multi-user two-way networks.\n  We first consider deterministic two-way channel models: the binary modulo-2\naddition channel and a generalization thereof, and the linear deterministic\nchannel. For these deterministic models we obtain the capacity region for the\ntwo-way multiple access/broadcast channel, the two-way Z channel and the\ntwo-way interference channel (IC). In all cases we permit all nodes to adapt\nchannel inputs to past outputs (except for portions of the linear deterministic\ntwo-way IC where we only permit 2 of the 4 nodes to fully adapt). However, we\nshow that this adaptation is useless from a capacity region perspective and\ncapacity is achieved by strategies where the channel inputs at each use do not\nadapt to previous inputs. Finally, we consider the Gaussian two-way IC, and\nshow that partial adaptation is useless when the interference is very strong.\nIn the strong and weak interference regimes, we show that the non-adaptive Han\nand Kobayashi scheme utilized in parallel in both directions achieves to within\na constant gap for the symmetric rate of the fully (some regimes) or partially\n(remaining regimes) adaptive models.\n  The central technical contribution is the derivation of new, computable outer\nbounds which allow for adaptation.

A single-hop\nbroadcasting system model is considered that aims to deliver a block of packets\nto all receivers in the presence of packet erasures. For a fair and\nanalytically tractable comparison between the two coding schemes, the\ntransmission comprises two phases: a systematic transmission phase and a\nnetwork coded transmission phase which is further divided into rounds. After\nthe systematic transmission phase and given the same packet reception state,\nthree quantitative metrics are proposed and derived in each scheme: 1) the\nabsolute minimum number of transmissions in the first coded transmission round\n(assuming no erasures), 2) probability distribution of extra coded\ntransmissions in a subsequent round (due to erasures), and 3) average packet\ndecoding delay. This comparative study enables application-aware adaptive\nselection between IDNC and RLNC after systematic transmission phase.\n  One contribution of this paper is to provide a deep and systematic\nunderstanding of the IDNC scheme, to propose the notion of packet diversity and\nan optimal IDNC encoding scheme for minimizing metric 1. This is generally\nNP-hard, but nevertheless required for characterizing and deriving all the\nthree metrics.

IDNC is more preferable than RLNC when the number\nof receivers is smaller than packet block size, and the case reverses when the\nnumber of receivers is much greater than the packet block size.

We will mainly describe the algebraic structure, its natural morphisms\nand parameterizations. The theory of total positivity will play a particularly\nimportant role.\n  Then, we anticipate on the probabilistic part by exhibiting a canonical\nmeasure on geometric crystals. It uses as ingredients the superpotential for\nthe flag manifold and a measure invariant under the crystal actions. The image\nmeasure under the weight map plays the role of Duistermaat-Heckman measure. Its\nLaplace transform defines Whittaker functions, providing an interesting formula\nfor all Lie groups. Then it appears clearly that Whittaker functions are to\ngeometric crystals, what characters are to combinatorial crystals. The\nLittlewood-Richardson rule is also exposed.\n  Finally we present the probabilistic approach that allows to find the\ncanonical measure. It is based on the fundamental idea that the Wiener measure\nwill induce the adequate measure on the algebraic structures through the path\nmodel.\n  In the last chapter, we show how our geometric model degenerates to the\ncontinuous classical Littelmann path model and thus recover known results. For\nexample, the canonical measure on a geometric crystal of highest weight\ndegenerates into a uniform measure on a polytope, and recovers the\nparameterizations of continuous crystals. \n\n"}

Abstract: Which components of the singular value decomposition of a signal-plus-noise\ndata matrix are most informative for the inferential task of detecting or\nestimating an embedded low-rank signal matrix? Principal component analysis\nascribes greater importance to the components that capture the greatest\nvariation, i.e., the singular vectors associated with the largest singular\nvalues. This choice is often justified by invoking the Eckart-Young theorem\neven though that work addresses the problem of how to best represent a\nsignal-plus-noise matrix using a low-rank approximation and not how to\nbest_infer_ the underlying low-rank signal component.\n  Here we take a first-principles approach in which we start with a\nsignal-plus-noise data matrix and show how the spectrum of the noise-only\ncomponent governs whether the principal or the middle components of the\nsingular value decomposition of the data matrix will be the informative\ncomponents for inference. Simply put, if the noise spectrum is supported on a\nconnected interval, in a sense we make precise, then the use of the principal\ncomponents is justified. When the noise spectrum is supported on multiple\nintervals, then the middle components might be more informative than the\nprincipal components.\n  The end result is a proper justification of the use of principal components\nin the setting where the noise matrix is i.i.d. Gaussian and the identification\nof scenarios, generically involving heterogeneous noise models such as mixtures\nof Gaussians, where the middle components might be more informative than the\nprincipal components so that they may be exploited to extract additional\nprocessing gain.

In this paper we consider a more feasible problem for the\ntransmitter to have eavesdropper's CSI.

The macroscopic eigenvalue distribution of such matrices is governed by\nthe so called Single Ring Theorem, due to Guionnet, Krishnapur and Zeitouni. We\nfirst prove that if $P$ has some eigenvalues out of the maximal circle of the\nsingle ring, then $A+P$ has some eigenvalues (called outliers) in the\nneighborhood of those of $P$, which is not the case for the eigenvalues of $P$\nin the inner cycle of the single ring.

In this contribution we\ndevelop a complete qualitative stochastic homogenization theory for nonconvex\nunbounded functionals with convex growth.

Using the recently developed 'non-anticipative\nfunctional calculus', we first develop a pathwise definition of the gain\nprocess for a large class of continuous-time trading strategies which include\nthe important class of delta-hedging strategies, as well as a pathwise\ndefinition of the self-financing condition. Using these concepts, we propose a\nframework for analyzing the performance and robustness of delta-hedging\nstrategies for path-dependent derivatives across a given set of scenarios. Our\nsetting allows for general path-dependent payoffs and does not require any\nprobabilistic assumption on the dynamics of the underlying asset, thereby\nextending previous results on robustness of hedging strategies in the setting\nof diffusion models. We obtain a pathwise formula for the hedging error for a\ngeneral path-dependent derivative and provide sufficient conditions ensuring\nthe robustness of the delta hedge.

The interacting diffusions pave a way to\nprobabilistic representations for many important nonlinear/nonlocal PDEs, but\nprovide a great challenge for Monte Carlo simulations. This is due to the\nnonlinear dependence of the bias on the statistical error arising through the\napproximation of the law of the process. This and the fact that\nparticles/diffusions are not independent render classical variance reduction\ntechniques not directly applicable and consequently make simulations of\ninteracting diffusions prohibitive. In this article, we provide an alternative\niterative particle representation, inspired by the fixed point argument by\nSznitman \\cite{sznitman1991topics}. This new representation has the same mean\nfield limit as the classical SIPS. However, unlike classical SIPS, it also\nallows decomposing the statistical error and the approximation bias.

Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of signal estimation from undersampled\nnoisy sub-Gaussian measurements under the assumption of a cosparse model. Based\non generalized notions of sparsity, we derive novel recovery guarantees for the\n$\\ell^1$-analysis basis pursuit, enabling accurate predictions of its sample\ncomplexity. The corresponding bounds on the number of required measurements do\nexplicitly depend on the Gram matrix of the analysis operator and therefore\nparticularly account for its mutual coherence structure. Our findings defy\nconventional wisdom which promotes the sparsity of analysis coefficients as the\ncrucial quantity to study. In fact, this common paradigm breaks down completely\nin many situations of practical interest, for instance, when applying a\nredundant (multilevel) frame as analysis prior. By extensive numerical\nexperiments, we demonstrate that, in contrast, our theoretical sampling-rate\nbounds reliably capture the recovery capability of various examples, such as\nredundant wavelets systems, total variation, or random frames. The proofs of\nour main results build upon recent achievements in the convex geometry of data\nmining problems. More precisely, we establish a sophisticated upper bound on\nthe conic Gaussian mean width that is associated with the underlying\n$\\ell^1$-analysis polytope.

This work studies the optimization of spectrum pooling for the\ndownlink of a multi-tenant Cloud Radio Access Network (C-RAN) system in the\npresence of inter-tenant privacy constraints. The spectrum available for\ndownlink transmission is partitioned into private and shared subbands, and the\nparticipating operators cooperate to serve the user equipments (UEs) on the\nshared subband. The network of each operator consists of a cloud processor (CP)\nthat is connected to proprietary radio units (RUs) by means of finite-capacity\nfronthaul links. In order to enable interoperator cooperation, the CPs of the\nparticipating operators are also connected by finite-capacity backhaul links.\nInter-operator cooperation may hence result in loss of privacy. Fronthaul and\nbackhaul links are used to transfer quantized baseband signals. Standard\nquantization is considered first.

First, in the integrated UAV WPCN, a UAV acts as a hybrid AP in which\nboth energy transfer and information reception are processed at a single UAV.\nIn contrast, for the separated UAV WPCN, we consider two UAVs each of which\nbehaves as an energy AP and an information AP independently, and thus the\nenergy transfer and the information decoding are separately performed at two\ndifferent UAVs. For both systems, we jointly optimize the trajectories of the\nUAVs, the uplink power control, and the time resource allocation for the WET\nand the WIT to maximize the minimum throughput of the GTs. Since the formulated\nproblems are non-convex, we apply the concave-convex procedure by deriving\nappropriate convex bounds for non-convex constraints. As a result, we propose\niterative algorithms which efficiently identify a local optimal solution for\nthe minimum throughput maximization problems. Simulation results verify the\nefficiency of the proposed algorithms compared to conventional schemes. \n\n"}

These updates\nare to be transmitted through a network to a monitor. However, the transmission\npolicy of each packet depends on the type of stream it belongs to. For the low\npriority stream, we analyze and compare the performances of two transmission\nschemes: (i) Ordinary updates are served in a First-Come-First-Served (FCFS)\nfashion, whereas, in (ii), the ordinary updates are transmitted according to an\nM/G/1/1 with preemption policy. In both schemes, high priority updates are\ntransmitted according to an M/G/1/1 with preemption policy and receive\npreferential treatment. An arriving priority update discards and replaces any\ncurrently-in-service high priority update, and preempts (with eventual resume\nfor scheme (i)) any ordinary update. We model the arrival processes of the two\nkinds of updates, in both schemes, as independent Poisson processes. For scheme\n(i), we find the arrival and service rates under which the system is stable and\ngive closed-form expressions for average peak age and a lower bound on the\naverage age of the ordinary stream. For scheme (ii), we derive closed-form\nexpressions for the average age and average peak age of the high priority and\nlow priority streams. We finally show that, if the service time is\nexponentially distributed, the M/M/1/1 with preemption policy leads to an\naverage age of the low priority stream higher than the one achieved using the\nFCFS scheme. Therefore, the M/M//1/1 with preemption policy, when applied on\nthe low priority stream of updates and in the presence of a higher priority\nscheme, is not anymore the optimal transmission policy from an age point of\nview. \n\n"}

In this paper, for all integers\n$q\\geq 3$ and $\\Delta\\geq 3$, we develop algorithms that produce samples within\nerror $o(1)$ from the $q$-state Potts model on random $\\Delta$-regular graphs,\nwhenever the temperature is in uniqueness, for both the ferromagnetic and\nantiferromagnetic cases.\n  The algorithm for the antiferromagnetic Potts model is based on iteratively\nadding the edges of the graph and resampling a bichromatic class that contains\nthe endpoints of the newly added edge. Key to the algorithm is how to perform\nthe resampling step efficiently since bichromatic classes may induce\nlinear-sized components. To this end, we exploit the tree uniqueness to show\nthat the average growth of bichromatic components is typically small, which\nallows us to use correlation decay algorithms for the resampling step.

In order to obtain nontrivial\nupper bounds, properties of the skew-divergence are developed and notions of\n\"skew\" $f$-divergences are introduced; a reverse Pinsker inequality and a bound\non Jensen-Shannon divergence are obtained along the way. Complementary lower\nbounds are derived with special attention paid to the case that corresponds to\nindependent summation of a continuous and a discrete random variable. Several\napplications of the bounds are delineated, including to mutual information of\nadditive noise channels, thermodynamics of computation, and functional\ninequalities. \n\n"}

The latter is defined as a\nlinear combination of $k$ independent symmetric rank-one random tensors,\nreferred to as spikes, with weights referred to as signal-to-noise ratios\n(SNRs). The entries of the vectors that determine the spikes are i.i.d. sampled\nfrom general probability distributions supported on bounded subsets of\n$\\mathbb{R}$. This work focuses on the problem of detecting the presence of\nthese spikes, and establishes the phase transition of this detection problem\nfor any fixed $k \\geq 1$. In particular, it shows that for a set of relatively\nlow SNRs it is impossible to distinguish between the spiked and non-spiked\nGaussian tensors. Furthermore, in the interior of the complement of this set,\nwhere at least one of the $k$ SNRs is relatively high, these two tensors are\ndistinguishable by the likelihood ratio test. In addition, when the total\nnumber of low-rank components, $k$, of the $p$-tensor of size $N$ grows in the\norder $o(N^{(p-2)/4})$ as $N$ tends to infinity, the problem exhibits an\nanalogous phase transition.

It is partially\nasymmetric in the sense that the probability of hopping left is q times the\nprobability of hopping right. Additionally, particles may enter from the left\nwith probability alpha and exit from the right with probability beta.\n  It has been observed that the (unique) stationary distribution of the PASEP\nhas remarkable connections to combinatorics -- see for example the papers of\nDerrida, Duchi and Schaeffer, and Corteel. Most recently we proved that in fact\nthe (normalized) probability of being in a particular state of the PASEP can be\nviewed as a certain weight generating function for permutation tableaux of a\nfixed shape.

However,\nour proof relied on the matrix ansatz of Derrida et al, and hence did not give\nan intuitive explanation of why one should expect the steady state distribution\nof the PASEP to involve such nice combinatorics.\n  In this paper we define a Markov chain -- which we call the PT chain -- on\nthe set of permutation tableaux which projects to the PASEP in a very strong\nsense.
