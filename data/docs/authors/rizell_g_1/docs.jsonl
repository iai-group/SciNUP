The $\\Z_2$\n$SFH$ of these solid tori forms a \"categorification of Pascal's triangle\", and\ncontact structures correspond bijectively to chord diagrams, or sets of\ndisjoint properly embedded arcs in the disc. Their contact elements are\ndistinct and form distinguished subsets of $SFH$ of order given by the Narayana\nnumbers. We find natural \"creation and annihilation operators\" which allow us\nto define a QFT-type basis of $SFH$, consisting of contact elements. Sutured\nFloer homology in this case reduces to the combinatorics of chord diagrams. We\nprove that contact elements are in bijective correspondence with comparable\npairs of basis elements with respect to a certain partial order. The algebraic\nand combinatorial structures in this description have intrinsic\ncontact-topological meaning. In particular, the QFT-basis of $SFH$ and its\npartial order have a natural interpretation in pure contact topology, related\nto the contact category of a disc: the partial order enables us to tell when\nthe sutured solid cylinder obtained by \"stacking\" two chord diagrams has a\ntight contact structure. This leads us to extend Honda's notion of contact\ncategory to a \"bounded\" contact category, containing chord diagrams and contact\nstructures which occur within a given contact solid cylinder. We compute this\nbounded contact category in certain cases. Moreover, the decomposition of a\ncontact element into basis elements naturally gives a triple of contact\nstructures on solid cylinders which we regard as a type of \"distinguished\ntriangle\" in the contact category.

It is called\nGorenstein if the canonical line bundle is holomorphically trivial in some\npunctured neighborhood of the singular point and is called numerically\nGorenstein if this line bundle is topologically trivial. The second notion\ndepends only on the topological type of the singularity. Laufer proved in 1977\nthat, given a numerically Gorenstein topological type of singularity, every\nanalytical realization of it is Gorenstein if and only if one has either a\nKleinian or a minimally elliptic topological type. The question to know if any\nnumerically Gorenstein topology was realizable by some Gorenstein singularity\nwas left open. We prove that this is indeed the case. Our method is to plumb\nholomorphically meromorphic 2-forms obtained by adequate pull-backs of the\nnatural holomorphic symplectic forms on the total spaces of the canonical line\nbundles of complex curves. More generally, we show that any normal surface\nsingularity is homeomorphic to a Q-Gorenstein singularity whose index is equal\nto the smallest common denominator of the coefficients of the canonical cycle\nof the starting singularity. \n\n"}

The structure of the graph of $c(a)$ is surprisingly rich.\nThe volume constraint implies that $c(a)$ is always greater than or equal to\nthe square root of $a$, and it is not hard to see that this is equality for\nlarge $a$. However, for $a$ less than the fourth power $\\tau^4$ of the golden\nratio, $c(a)$ is piecewise linear, with graph that alternately lies on a line\nthrough the origin and is horizontal. We prove this by showing that there are\nexceptional curves in blow ups of the complex projective plane whose homology\nclasses are given by the continued fraction expansions of ratios of Fibonacci\nnumbers.

Their construction\nlinks to combinatorial geometry and algebraic geometry of toric varieties via\nthe related notion of a quasitoric manifold. Discovery of remarkable geometric\nstructures on moment-angle manifolds led to seminal connections with the\nclassical and modern areas of symplectic, Lagrangian and non-Kaehler complex\ngeometry.

The theory of CSM classes has been\nextended to the equivariant setting by Ohmoto. We prove that for an arbitrary\ncomplex projective manifold $X$, the homogenized, torus equivariant CSM class\nof a constructible function $\\varphi$ is the restriction of the characteristic\ncycle of $\\varphi$ via the zero section of the cotangent bundle of $X$. This\nextends to the equivariant setting results of Ginzburg and Sabbah. We\nspecialize $X$ to be a (generalized) flag manifold $G/B$. In this case CSM\nclasses are determined by a Demazure-Lusztig (DL) operator. We prove a `Hecke\northogonality' of CSM classes, determined by the DL operator and its\nPoincar{\\'e} adjoint.

Twistings in this theory will be\nparticularly important. There will be two types of Calabi-Yau structures in the\nsetting of ring spectra: one that applies to compact algebras and one that\napplies to smooth algebras. The main application of twisted compact Calabi-Yau\nring spectra that we will study is to describe, prove, and explain a certain\nduality phenomenon in string topology. This is a duality between the manifold\nstring topology of Chas-Sullivan and the Lie group string topology of\nChataur-Menichi. This will extend and generalize work of Gruher. Then,\ngeneralizing work of the first author and Jones, we show how the gauge group of\nthe principal bundle acts on this compact Calabi-Yau structure, and compute\nsome explicit examples. We then extend the notion of the Calabi-Yau structure\nto smooth ring spectra, and prove that Thom ring spectra of (virtual) bundles\nover the loop space, $\\Omega M$, have this structure. In the case when $M$ is a\nsphere we will use these twisted smooth Calabi-Yau ring spectra to study\nLagrangian immersions of the sphere into its cotangent bundle.

Courant on Dirac structures; they were later studied by Liu,\nWeinstein and Xu who used Courant algebroids to generalize the notion of the\nDrinfeld double to Lie bialgebroids. As a first step towards understanding the\ncomplicated properties of Courant algebroids, we interpret them by associating\nto each Courant algebroid a strongly homotopy Lie algebra in a natural way.\nNext, we propose an alternative construction of the double of a Lie bialgebroid\nas a homological hamiltonian vector field on an even symplectic supermanifold.\nThe classical BRST complex and the Weil algebra arise as special cases. We\nrecover the Courant algebroid via the derived bracket construction and give a\nsimple proof of the doubling theorem of Liu, Weinstein and Xu. We also\nintroduce a generalization, quasi-Lie bialgebroids, analogous to Drinfeld's\nquasi-Lie bialgebras; we show that the derived bracket construction in this\ncase also yields a Courant algebroid. Finally, we compute the Poisson\ncohomology of a one-parameter family of SU(2)- covariant Poisson structures on\nS^2. As an application, we show that these structures are non-trivial\ndeformations of each other, and that they do not admit rescaling. \n\n"}

They are studied here. They are\nclosely related to discriminants and Lagrange maps. Frobenius manifolds are\nF-manifolds. As an application a conjecture of Dubrovin on Frobenius manifolds\nand Coxeter groups is proved. \n\n"}

Besides providing a new proof of\nthis conjecture for the full non-abelian group action case, our methods lead to\na generalisation for compact Lie group actions on manifolds that are not\nsymplectic. Instead, these manifolds carry an invariant almost complex\nstructure and an abstract moment map. \n\n"}
{"id": "math/9912021", "contents": "Title: Toda lattice and toric varieties for real split semisimple Lie algebras Abstract: The paper concerns the topology of an isospectral real smooth manifold for\ncertain Jacobi element associated with real split semisimple Lie algebra. The\nmanifold is identified as a compact, connected completion of the disconnected\nCartan subgroup of the corresponding Lie group $\\tilde G$ which is a disjoint\nunion of the split Cartan subgroups associated to semisimple portions of Levi\nfactors of all standard parabolic subgroups of $\\tilde G$. The manifold is also\nrelated to the compactified level sets of a generalized Toda lattice equation\ndefined on the semisimple Lie algebra, which is diffeomorphic to a toric\nvariety in the flag manifold ${\\tilde G}/B$ with Borel subgroup $B$ of $\\tilde\nG$. We then give a cellular decomposition and the associated chain complex of\nthe manifold by introducing colored-signed Dynkin diagrams which parametrize\nthe cells in the decomposition. \n\n"}

The last problem involves a\nconjecture on the structure of proper groupoids. Attempting to prove this by\nthe method of averaging leads to problems concerning almost actions of compact\ngroups and almost invariant submanifolds for compact group actions. The paper\nends with a discussion of possible extensions of the convexity theorems for\nmomentum maps of hamiltonian actions of compact groups. \n\n"}
