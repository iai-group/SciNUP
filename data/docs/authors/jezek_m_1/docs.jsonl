The versions of Quantum Prisoners Dilemma presented in the literature\ncan therefore be thought of specific instances of the single family of Quantum\nPrisoner's Dilemma with respect to a particular measurement. The conditions for\nequilibrium are given for playable quantum games both in terms of expected\noutcomes and a geometric approach. We discuss how any quantum game can be\nsimulated with a classical game played with classical coins as far as the\nstrategy selections and expected outcomes are concerned. \n\n"}

We\ncall negation in this mode the mark, as it operates on itself to change from\nmarked to unmarked states. The mark viewed recursively as a simplest discrete\ndynamical system naturally generates the fermion algebra, the quaternions and\nthe braid group representations related to Majorana fermions. The paper begins\nwith these fundmentals. They provide a conceptual key to many of the models\nthat appear later in the paper. In particular, the Fibonacci model for\ntopological quantum computing is seen to be based on the fusion rules for a\nMajorana fermion and these in turn are the interaction rules for the mark seen\nas a logical particle. It requires a shift in viewpoint to see that the\noperator of negation can also be seen as a logical value. The quaternions\nemerge naturally from the reentering mark. All these models have their roots in\nunitary representations of the Artin braid group to the quaternions. \n\n"}

In this paper we seek to explain the disappearance of\nquantum-mechanical reflection in the quasi-classical limit, using standard\nmethods of decoherence through environmental interaction. We consider two\nmodels. In the first, the incoming particle is classicalized by coupling it to\nan environment described by a standard Lindblad master equation diagonalizing\nin position. We find, however, that suppression of reflection is achieved only\nfor environmental interaction so strong that large fluctuations in momentum are\ngenerated which blurs the distinction between incoming and reflected wave\npackets. This negative conclusion also holds for a complex potential which has\nsimilar implications for attempts to understand the suppression of the Zeno\neffect using the same mechanism (discussed in more detail in another paper).

In the quantum formalism, indistinguishability is\nexpressed via the symmetrization postulate, which restricts a system of\nidentical particles to the set of symmetric states (`bosons') or the set of\nantisymmetric states (`fermions'). However, the physical basis and range of\nvalidity of the symmetrization postulate has not been established. A well-known\ntopological derivation of the postulate implies that its validity depends on\nthe dimensionality of the space in which the particles move. However, this\nderivation relies on the labeling of indistinguishable particles, a notion that\ncannot be justified on an informational basis. Here we show that the\nsymmetrization postulate can be derived by strictly adhering to the\ninformational requirement that particles which cannot be experimentally\ndistinguished from one another are not labeled. Our key novel postulate is the\noperational indistinguishability postulate, which posits that the amplitude of\na process involving several indistinguishable particles is determined by the\namplitudes of all possible transitions of these particles when treated as\ndistinguishable. The symmetrization postulate follows by requiring consistency\nwith the rest of the quantum formalism. The derivation implies that the\nsymmetrization postulate admits no natural variants.

The consistent\nhistories formalism is a tool for describing sequences of events taking place\nin an evolving closed quantum system. A set of histories is consistent when one\ncan reason about them using Boolean logic, i.e., when probabilities of\nsequences of events that define histories are additive. However, the vast\nmajority of the sets of histories that are merely consistent are flagrantly\nnon-classical in other respects. This embarras de richesses (known as the set\nselection problem) suggests that one must go beyond consistency to identify how\nthe classical past arises in our quantum Universe. The key intuition we follow\nis that the records of events that define the familiar objective past are\ninscribed in many distinct systems, e.g., subsystems of the environment, and\nare accessible locally in space and time to observers. We identify histories\nthat are not just consistent but redundantly consistent using the partial-trace\ncondition introduced by Finkelstein as a bridge between histories and\ndecoherence.

In this paper, we consider one situation, which is\nslightly different from the forgery problem, that we check whether at least one\nquantum message with signature can be forged in a given scheme, although all\nthe messages cannot be forged. If there exist only a finite number of forgeable\nquantum messages in the scheme then the scheme can be secure against the\nforgery attack by not sending the forgeable quantum messages, and so our\nsituation does not directly imply that we check whether the scheme is secure\nagainst the attack.

In frequency estimation\nscenarios, however, there are exceptions to this rule and, in particular, it\nhas been found that transversal dephasing does allow for a scaling quantum\nadvantage. Yet, it has remained unclear whether such exemptions can be\nexploited in practical scenarios. Here, we argue that the transversal-noise\nmodel applies to the setting of recent magnetometry experiments and show that a\nscaling advantage can be maintained with one-axis-twisted spin-squeezed states\nand Ramsey-interferometry-like measurements. This is achieved by exploiting the\ngeometry of the setup that, as we demonstrate, has a strong influence on the\nachievable quantum enhancement for experimentally feasible parameter settings.\nWhen, in addition to the dominant transversal noise, other sources of\ndecoherence are present, the quantum advantage is asymptotically bounded by a\nconstant, but this constant may be significantly improved by exploring the\ngeometry. \n\n"}

We first search for\nways to create quantum gates, the primitive building blocks of a quantum\ncomputer. We find a novel, low-control way of performing a two-qubit gate on\nqubits encoded in a decoherence-free subspace, making use of many-body\ninteractions that may already be present. This includes an analysis of the\neffect of control errors and magnetic field fluctuations on the gate. We then\npresent novel ways to create three-qubit Toffoli and Fredkin gates in a single\nstep using linear arrays of qubits, including an assessment of how well these\ngates could perform, for quantum or classical computation, using\nstate-of-the-art ion trap and silicon donor technology. We then focus on a very\ndifferent model from the normal circuit model, combining ideas from\nmeasurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) and holonomic quantum computation,\nshowing that all MBQC patterns with a property called \\emph{gflow} can be\nconverted into a holonomic computation. The manifestation of the properties of\nMBQC in this adiabatically driven model is then explored. Finally, we\ninvestigate ways in which quantum information can be communicated between\ndistant parties, using minimally engineered spin chains. The viability of using\n1D Wigner crystals as a quantum channel is analysed, as well as schemes using\nideal uniform spin chains with next-neighbour interactions, and edge-locking\neffects. \n\n"}

We show that the precision of measuring a small optical beam\ndisplacement with this method can be significantly enhanced by the correlation\nbetween the two photons, given the same optical mode. The improvement is\nlargest if the correlations between the photons are strong, and falls off as\nthe biphoton correlation weakens. More surprisingly, we find that the smallest\nresolvable parameter of a simple split detector scales as the inverse of the\nnumber of biphotons for small biphoton number (\"Heisenberg scaling\"), because\nthe Fisher information diverges as the parameter to be estimated decreases in\nvalue. One usually sees this scaling only for systems with many entangled\ndegrees of freedom. We discuss the transition for the split-detection scheme to\nthe standard quantum limit scaling for imperfect correlations as the biphoton\nnumber is increased. An analysis of an $N$-pixel detector is also given to\ninvestigate the benefit of using a higher resolution detector. The physical\nlimit of these metrology schemes is determined by the uncertainty in the birth\nzone of the biphoton in the nonlinear crystal. \n\n"}

This improved bound smoothly interpolates between the\nworst-case quadratic and best-case linear scalings for composite error\nchannels. As an application we show how our analysis substantially improves the\nachievable precision on estimates of the error rates of individual gates under\ninterleaved randomized benchmarking, enabling greater precision for current\nexperimental methods to assess and tune-up control over quantum gate\noperations. \n\n"}

The time scale at which\nthis compression takes place, or in other words the time we have to wait for\nany input state to become almost indistinguishable from the fixed point, is\ncalled the mixing time of the process. Rapid mixing is a condition on the\nscaling of this mixing time with the system size: if it is logarithmic, then we\nhave rapid mixing.\n  The main contribution of this thesis is to show that rapid mixing has\nprofound implications for the corresponding system: it is stable against\nexternal perturbations and its fixed point satisfies an area law for mutual\ninformation. \n\n"}

This\nout-of-equilibrium state allows us to obtain work and to carry information.\nHere, we propose and experimentally demonstrate an advanced approach,\nconditionally preparing more efficient out-of-equilibrium states only by a weak\ndissipation, an inefficient quantum measurement of the dissipated thermal\nenergy, and subsequent triggering of that states.

Recent studies have attempted\nto find features of that spreading which could distinguish between chaotic and\nintegrable dynamics. The operator entanglement - the entanglement entropy in\noperator space - is a natural candidate to provide such a distinction. Indeed,\nwhile it is believed that the operator entanglement grows linearly with time\n$t$ in chaotic systems, numerics suggests that it grows only logarithmically in\nintegrable systems. That logarithmic growth has already been established for\nnon-interacting fermions, however progress on interacting integrable systems\nhas proved very difficult. Here, for the first time, a logarithmic upper bound\nis established rigorously for all local operators in such a system: the `Rule\n54' qubit chain, a model of cellular automaton introduced in the 1990s [Bobenko\net al., CMP 158, 127 (1993)], recently advertised as the simplest\nrepresentative of interacting integrable systems. Physically, the logarithmic\nbound originates from the fact that the dynamics of the models is mapped onto\nthe one of stable quasiparticles that scatter elastically; the possibility of\ngeneralizing this scenario to other interacting integrable systems is briefly\ndiscussed. \n\n"}

A sharp\nminimum-energy dip appears in the transmission spectrum of a weak input field,\nwhich reveals rich behavior of the long-range interactions arising from\nlocalized bound states. We find that the dip frequency scales linearly with\nboth the number of the artificial atoms and the characteristic strength of the\nlong-range interactions when the localization length of the bound state is\nsufficiently large.

The model is a pure Z_2 gauge theory in which randomly\nchosen plaquettes (occuring with concentration p) have couplings with the\n``wrong sign'' so that magnetic flux is energetically favored on these\nplaquettes. Excitations of the model are one-dimensional ``flux tubes'' that\nterminate at ``magnetic monopoles.'' Electric confinement can be driven by\nthermal fluctuations of the flux tubes, by the quenched background of magnetic\nmonopoles, or by a combination of the two. Like the RBIM, the RPGM has enhanced\nsymmetry along a ``Nishimori line'' in the p-T plane (where T is the\ntemperature). The critical concentration p_c of wrong-sign plaquettes at the\nconfinement-Higgs phase transition along the Nishimori line can be identified\nwith the accuracy threshold for robust storage of quantum information using\ntopological error-correcting codes: if qubit phase errors, qubit bit-flip\nerrors, and errors in the measurement of local check operators all occur at\nrates below p_c, then encoded quantum information can be protected perfectly\nfrom damage in the limit of a large code block.

It\nhas been demonstrated that mutual coupling can be increased by using residual\ndipolar couplings among spins by orienting the spin system in a liquid\ncrystalline matrix. In such a case, the heteronuclear spins are weakly coupled\nbut the homonuclear spins become strongly coupled. In such circumstances, the\nstrongly coupled spins can no longer be treated as qubits.

This is the last ingredient necessary to introduce a unique\ninner product in the linear space of wave functions.

We consider the time dynamics of wave functions and increase of\nentropy in such chaotic systems.\n  As an example we present the time evolution in a closed quantum computer.
