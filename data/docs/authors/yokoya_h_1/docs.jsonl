The simplest model\nrelies on two scalar fields, whose entropy perturbation leads to a\nscale-invariant spectrum of density fluctuations. The ekpyrotic solution has a\ntachyonic instability along the entropy field direction which, a priori,\nappears to require fine-tuning of the initial conditions. In this paper, we\nshow that these can be achieved naturally by adding a small positive mass term\nfor the tachyonic field and coupling to light fermions. Then, for a wide range\nof initial conditions, the tachyonic field gets stabilized with the appropriate\nvalues well before the onset of the ekpyrotic phase. Furthermore, we show that\nekpyrotic theory is successful in solving the flatness, horizon and homogeneity\nproblems of standard big bang cosmology. Motivated by the analysis of the\ntachyonic instability, we propose a simplification of the model in terms of new\nfield variables. Instead of requiring two exponential potentials, one for each\nscalar field, it suffices to consider a single nearly exponential potential for\none of the fields and a tachyonic mass term along the orthogonal direction in\nfield space. All other terms in the potential are essentially arbitrary. This\ngreatly widens the class of ekpyrotic potentials and allows substantial freedom\nin determining the spectral index and possible non-Gaussianity.

It is known that there are four types of\nsuch models corresponding to the possible different assignment of charges for\nthe discrete symmetry on quarks and leptons.

Since the cross section is defined through final states containing the\ntop decay products, a consistent definition of the cross section depends on\nprescriptions how these final states are accounted for the cross section.\nExperimentally, these prescriptions are implemented for example through cuts on\nkinematic quantities such as the reconstructed top quark invariant masses. As\nlong as these cuts do not reject final states that can arise from the decay of\na top and an anti-top quark with a small off-shellness compatible with the\nnonrelativistic power-counting, they can be implemented through imaginary phase\nspace matching conditions in NRQCD. The prescription-dependent cross section\ncan then be determined from the optical theorem using the $e^+e^-$ forward\nscattering amplitude. We compute the phase space matching conditions associated\nto cuts on the top and anti-top invariant masses at next-to-next-to-leading\nlogarithmic (NNLL) order and partially at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading\nlogarithmic (N${}^3$LL) order in the nonrelativistic expansion and, together\nwith finite lifetime and electroweak effects known from previous work, analyze\ntheir numerical impact on the $t\\bar t$ cross section.

In this paper we improve\nexisting calculations of the doubly differential cross section in the invariant\nmass and scattering angle by using techniques from soft-collinear effective\ntheory to perform an NNLL resummation of threshold logarithms, which become\nlarge when the invariant mass M of the top-quark pair approaches the partonic\ncenter-of-mass energy.

Abstract: We consider the possibility that the new particle that has been observed at\n125 GeV is not the Standard Model (SM) Higgs, but instead the dilaton\nassociated with an approximate conformal symmetry that has been spontaneously\nbroken. We focus on dilatons that arise from theories of technicolor, or from\ntheories of the Higgs as a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB), that involve\nstrong conformal dynamics in the ultraviolet. In the pNGB case, we are\nconsidering a framework where the Higgs particle is significantly heavier than\nthe dilaton and has therefore not yet been observed. In each of the technicolor\nand pNGB scenarios, we study both the case when the SM fermions and gauge\nbosons are elementary, and the case when they are composites of the strongly\ninteracting sector. Our analysis incorporates conformal symmetry violating\neffects, which are necessarily present since the dilaton is not massless, and\nis directly applicable to a broad class of models that stabilize the weak scale\nand involve strong conformal dynamics. Since the AdS/CFT correspondence relates\nthe radion in Randall-Sundrum (RS) models to the dilaton, our results also\napply to RS models with the SM fields localized on the infrared brane, or in\nthe bulk. We identify the parameters that can be used to distinguish the\ndilatons associated with the several different classes of theories being\nconsidered from each other, and from the SM Higgs. We perform a fit to all the\navailable data from several experiments and highlight the key observations to\nextract these parameters. We find that at present, both the technicolor and\npNGB dilaton scenarios provide a good fit to the data, comparable to the SM\nHiggs. We indicate the future observations that will help to corroborate or\nfalsify each scenario. \n\n"}

We propose that the enhancement needed in the\nStandard Model to attribute the observed CP violation in D to two pseudoscalar\nmodes may not operate for inclusive final states where asymmetries will likely\napproximate the quark level expectation. Experimentally testing this principle\nrequires a search for CP asymmetries in final states containing K and K-bar\nwith a total energy of less than M_D. We also propose that CP asymmetries may\nbe enhanced in modes where the tree is color suppressed. In particular, the\nfinal state rho0 rho0 is of special interest; similarly Ds-> rho0 K+ and rho0\nK*+ likewise appear interesting.

The answer is that such an embedding is very difficult and rare but not\nimpossible. Indeed we were able to find two examples of integrable models\nembedded in Supergravity in this way. Both examples are fitted into N=1\nSupergravity by means of a very specific and interesting choice of the\nsuperpotential W(z). The question whether there are examples of such an\nembedding in extended Gauged Supergravity remains open.

SM running couplings not only\nallow us to extrapolate SM physics up to the Planck scale, but equally\nimportant they are triggering the Higgs mechanism. This is possible by the fact\nthat the bare mass term in the Higgs potential changes sign at about mu_0 =\n1.4x10^16 GeV and in the symmetric phase is enhanced by quadratic terms in the\nPlanck mass. Such a huge Higgs mass term is able to play a key role in\ntriggering inflation in the early universe. In this article we extend our\nprevious investigation by working out the details of a Higgs inflation\nscenario. We show how different terms contributing to the Higgs Lagrangian are\naffecting inflation. Given the SM and its extrapolation to scales mu>mu_0 we\nfind a calculable cosmological constant V(0) which is weakly scale dependent\nand actually remains large during inflation. This is different to the Higgs\nfluctuation field dependent Delta V(phi), which decays exponentially during\ninflation, and actually would not provide a sufficient amount of inflation. The\nfluctuation field has a different effective mass which shifts the bare Higgs\ntransition point to a lower value mu'_0 = 7.7x10^14 GeV. The vacuum energy V(0)\nbeing proportional to M_Pl^4 has a coefficient which vanishes near the Higgs\ntransition point, such that the bare and the renormalized cosmological constant\nmatch at this point.

Unfortunately, explicit calculations\nare often not feasible due to the complexity of the observables used for\ndiscrimination, and so many validation studies rely heavily, and solely, on\nMonte Carlo. In this paper we show how methods based on the parametric power\ncounting of the dynamics of QCD, familiar from effective theory analyses, can\nbe used to design, understand, and make robust predictions for the behavior of\njet substructure variables.

For instance, the stringent constraint from the $\\mu \\to e\n\\gamma$ process could be evaded according to the partial remnant symmetry. We\nalso investigate the breaking effect of the remnant symmetry mediated by the\nHiggs scalars, and investigate the constraints from the flavor physics: the\nflavor violating $\\tau$ and $\\mu$ decays, the electric dipole moments, and the\nmuon anomalous magnetic moment. We also discuss the correlation between FCNCs\nand nonzero $\\theta_{13}$, and point out the physical observables in the\ncharged lepton sector to test the BSMs for the neutrino mixing. \n\n"}

A method, proposed some time ago by two different groups and\nrelying on a bound on the electroweak penguin contribution, is shown to lack\nthe desired robustness and accuracy, and we propose a more alluring alternative\nusing a bound on the annihilation contribution. A second application consists\nin extracting information on hadronic amplitudes assuming the values of the CKM\nparameters from a global fit to quark flavour data. The current data yields\nseveral solutions, which do not fully support the hierarchy of hadronic\namplitudes usually expected from theoretical arguments (colour suppression,\nsuppression of electroweak penguins), as illustrated from computations within\nQCD factorisation. Some prospects concerning the impact of future measurements\nat LHCb and Belle II are also presented. Results are obtained with the\nCKMfitter analysis package, featuring the frequentist statistical approach and\nusing the Rfit scheme to handle theoretical uncertainties. \n\n"}

As\na consequence of this interaction, the vacuum is expected to become\nbirefringent and dichroic if a strong laser field polarizes its virtual\nparticle--antiparticle dipoles. Here, we derive how a generally polarized probe\nphoton beam is influenced by both vacuum birefringence and dichroism in a\nstrong linearly polarized plane-wave laser field. Furthermore, we consider an\nexperimental scheme to measure these effects in the nonperturbative high-energy\nregime, where the Euler-Heisenberg approximation breaks down. By employing\ncircularly polarized high-energy probe photons, as opposed to the\nconventionally considered linearly polarized ones, the feasibility of\nquantitatively confirming the prediction of nonlinear QED for vacuum\nbirefringence at the $5\\sigma$ confidence level on the time scale of a few days\nis demonstrated for upcoming 10 PW laser systems.

This opens dark matter\nproduction channels that are otherwise forbidden. The second model we consider,\ndubbed vev-induced freeze-in, is a fermionic Higgs portal scenario.

Here we explore the possibility that dark\nmatter cooled the gas through velocity-dependent, Rutherford-like interactions.\nWe argue that such interactions require a light mediator that is highly\nconstrained by 5th force experiments and limits from stellar cooling.\nConsequently, only a hidden or the visible photon can in principle mediate such\na force. Neutral hydrogen thus plays a sub-leading role and the cooling occurs\nvia the residual free electrons and protons.

The impact of the SHM$^{++}$ on signal models for\nWIMPs and axions is rather modest since the multiple changes and updates have\ncompeting effects.

To obtain bounds on\ncolor-triplets and color-singlets of charges up to |Q|=8, we recast searches\nfor signatures of two production channels: the \"open\" channel - where the\nparticles are pair-produced above threshold, and are detectable in dedicated\nLHC searches for stable multiply charged leptons, and the \"closed\" channel -\nwhere a particle-antiparticle pair is produced as a bound state, detectable in\nsearches for a diphoton resonance.

In\nboth open and closed production, we provide a careful assessment of\nphoton-induced processes using the accurate LUXqed PDF, resulting in\nsubstantially weaker bounds than previously claimed in the literature for the\ncolorless case.

In\nlittle Higgs theories, the Higgs mass-squareds are protected to the one-loop\norder from the quadratic divergence.

However, strong\nconstraints can still arise from the contributions of the new TeV scale\nparticles and hence re-introduces the fine-tuning problem. In this paper we\nshow that a new symmetry, denoted as T-parity, under which all heavy gauge\nbosons and scalar triplets are odd, can remove all the tree-level contributions\nto the electroweak observables and therefore makes the little Higgs theories\ncompletely natural. The T-parity can be manifestly implemented in a majority of\nlittle Higgs models by following the most general construction of the low\nenergy effective theory a la Callan, Coleman, Wess and Zumino.

In reality, however, no\ninteraction is strong enough to enforce a boundary condition on all frequencies\nof a fluctuating field. We construct a more physical model of the situation by\ncoupling the fluctuating field to a smooth background potential that implements\nthe boundary condition in a certain limit. To study this problem, we develop\ngeneral new methods to compute renormalized one--loop quantum energies and\nenergy densities. We use analytic properties of scattering data to compute\nGreen's functions in time--independent background fields at imaginary momenta.\nOur calculational method is particularly useful for numerical studies of\nsingular limits because it avoids terms that oscillate or require cancellation\nof exponentially growing and decaying factors. To renormalize, we identify\npotentially divergent contributions to the Casimir energy with low orders in\nthe Born series to the Green's function. We subtract these contributions and\nadd back the corresponding Feynman diagrams, which we combine with counterterms\nfixed by imposing standard renormalization conditions on low--order Green's\nfunctions. The resulting Casimir energy and energy density are finite\nfunctionals for smooth background potentials. In general, however, the Casimir\nenergy diverges in the boundary condition limit. This divergence is real and\nreflects the infinite energy needed to constrain a fluctuating field on all\nenergy scales; renormalizable quantum field theories have no place for ad hoc\nsurface counterterms.

These include\nsupersymmetric QCD for $N_f < N_c$, in which the superpotential is generated\nnonperturbatively, N=2 SU(2) Yang-Mills theory (the Seiberg-Witten model), in\nwhich the nonperturbative behavior of the effective coupling is described\ngeometrically, and supersymmetric QCD for N_f large, in which the theory\nillustrates a non-Abelian generalization of electric-magnetic duality.\n[Lectures presented at the 1996 TASI Summer School, to appear in the\nproceedings.] \n\n"}

We review our recent proof of\nthe $c$--theorem in four dimensions. Based on this proof and further evidence,\nwe conjecture that the realization of chiral symmetry be irreversible, flowing\nfrom the Wigner-Weyl realization at short distance to the Nambu--Goldstone\nrealization at long distance. We argue that three apparently independent\nconstraints based on the renormalization group, namely anomaly matching, the\nc-theorem and the conjectured symmetry realization theorem, are particular\nmanifestations of a single underlying principle. \n\n"}

The model has a scalar field chirally coupled\nto a fermion in 1+1 dimensions. We use a formalism that allows us to calculate\nthe exact one loop fermion contribution to the effective energy for a spatially\nvarying scalar background. This energy includes the contribution from\ncounterterms fixed in the perturbative sector of the theory. The resulting\nenergy is therefore finite and unambiguous. A variational search then yields a\nfermion number one configuration whose energy is below that of a single free\nfermion. \n\n"}

Here we show that antihyperons are driven towards local chemical\nequilibrium with pions, nucleons and kaons on a timescale of less than 3 fm/c\nwhen applying a similar argument for the antihyperons by considering the\ninverse channel of annihilation reactions anti-Y + p to pions + kaons. These\nmulti-mesonic reactions easily explain the antihyperon yields at CERN-SpS\nenergies as advertised in pure thermal, hadronic models without the need of a\nquark gluon plasma phase. In addition, the argument also applies for AGS\nenergies. \n\n"}

Our approach yields the\ntime and momentum dependence of the single particle distribution function.\nUnder conditions reckoned achievable at planned facilities, repeated cycles of\nparticle creation and annihilation take place in tune with the laser frequency.\nHowever, the peak particle number density is insensitive to this frequency and\none can anticipate the production of a few hundred particle pairs per laser\nperiod. Field-current feedback and quantum statistical effects are small and\ncan be neglected in this application of non-equilibrium quantum mean field\ntheory. \n\n"}
