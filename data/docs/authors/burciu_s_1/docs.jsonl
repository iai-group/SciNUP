We consider the more general quasi-co-Frobenius (QcF) coalgebras; in the\nfirst main result we show that these also admit symmetric characterizations: a\ncoalgebra is QcF if it is weakly isomorphic to its (left, or equivalently\nright) rational dual $Rat(C^*)$, in the sense that certain coproduct or product\npowers of these objects are isomorphic. These show that QcF coalgebras can be\nviewed as generalizations of both co-Frobenius coalgebras and Frobenius\nalgebras.

The equivalent characterizations of Hopf algebras\nwith left (or right) nonzero integrals as left (or right) co-Frobenius, or QcF,\nor semiperfect or with nonzero rational dual all follow immediately from these\nresults.

Assume that $B$ is a right $A$-module algebra and\nthat $A$ is a left $B$-comodule coalgebra. If the action and coaction are\nmatched, it is possible to define a coproduct $\\Delta_#$ on the smash product\n$A # B$ making the pair $(A # B,\\Delta_#)$ into an algebraic quantum group. In\nthis paper, we continue the study of these objects. First, we study the various\ndata of the bicrossproduct $A # B$, such as the modular automorphisms, the\nmodular elements, ... and obtain formulas in terms of the data of the\ncomponents $A$ and $B$. Secondly, we look at the dual of $A # B$ (in the sense\nof algebraic quantum groups) and we show it is itself a bicrossproduct (of the\nsecond type) of the duals $\\hatA$ and $\\hatB$. The result is immediate for\nfinite-dimensional Hopf algebras and therefore it is expected also for\nalgebraic quantum groups.

We will mainly describe the algebraic structure, its natural morphisms\nand parameterizations. The theory of total positivity will play a particularly\nimportant role.\n  Then, we anticipate on the probabilistic part by exhibiting a canonical\nmeasure on geometric crystals. It uses as ingredients the superpotential for\nthe flag manifold and a measure invariant under the crystal actions. The image\nmeasure under the weight map plays the role of Duistermaat-Heckman measure. Its\nLaplace transform defines Whittaker functions, providing an interesting formula\nfor all Lie groups. Then it appears clearly that Whittaker functions are to\ngeometric crystals, what characters are to combinatorial crystals. The\nLittlewood-Richardson rule is also exposed.\n  Finally we present the probabilistic approach that allows to find the\ncanonical measure. It is based on the fundamental idea that the Wiener measure\nwill induce the adequate measure on the algebraic structures through the path\nmodel.\n  In the last chapter, we show how our geometric model degenerates to the\ncontinuous classical Littelmann path model and thus recover known results. For\nexample, the canonical measure on a geometric crystal of highest weight\ndegenerates into a uniform measure on a polytope, and recovers the\nparameterizations of continuous crystals. \n\n"}

A closed subgroup $H$ of $G$ is called\nspherical provided it has a dense orbit on the flag variety $G/B$ of $G$.\nReductive spherical subgroups of simple Lie groups were classified by Kr\\\"amer\nin 1979.

It turns out that there is only one additional\ninstance (up to isogeny) in characteristic $2$ which has no counterpart in\nKr\\\"amer's classification.\n  As one of our key tools, we prove a general deformation result for subgroup\nschemes allowing us to deduce the sphericality of subgroups in positive\ncharacteristic from this property for subgroups in characteristic $0$. \n\n"}

The present article contributes to\nthe non-semisimple case, which is much more complicated. Namely, we study\nactions of finite dimensional (not necessarily semisimple) Hopf algebras on\ncommutative domains, particularly when H is pointed of finite Cartan type.\n  The work begins by reducing to the case where H acts inner faithfully on a\nfield; such a Hopf algebra is referred to as Galois-theoretical. We present\nexamples of such Hopf algebras, which include the Taft algebras, u_q(sl_2), and\nsome Drinfeld twists of other small quantum groups.

Once the bilinear covariants are expressed in terms of algebraic\nspinor fields, the duality between spinor and quantum spinor fields is thus\ndiscussed. Hence, by endowing the underlying spacetime with an arbitrary\nbilinear form with a antisymmetric part in addition to a symmetric spacetime\nmetric, quantum algebraic spinor fields and deformed bilinear covariants can be\nconstructed. They are therefore compared to the classical (non quantum) ones.\nClasses of quantum spinor fields are introduced and compared with Lounesto's\nspinor field classification. A physical interpretation of the deformed parts\nand the underlying Z-grading is proposed. The existence of an arbitrary\nbilinear form endowing the spacetime already has been explored in the\nliterature in the context of quantum gravity. Here, it is shown further to play\na prominent role in the structure of Dirac, Weyl, and Majorana spinor fields,\nbesides the most general flagpoles, dipoles and flag-dipoles ones as well.

However, the situation is more complex since in the\nnon-commutative framework three exponential-type maps and corresponding\nlogarithms are naturally defined. This results in several new formal group laws\ntogether with new operations - for example a new notion of adjoint action\nparticularly well fitted to the new theory. These developments are largely\nmotivated by various constructions in non-commutative probability theory. The\nsecond part of the article is devoted to exploring and deepening this\nperspective. We illustrate our approach by revisiting universal products from a\ngroup-theoretical viewpoint, including additive convolution in monotone, free\nand boolean probability, as well as the Bercovici-Pata bijection and\nsubordination products. \n\n"}

This is known as the Johnson graph. The symmetric group $S_n$ acts on\nthe space of complex functions on $X$ and this space has a multiplicity-free\ndecomposition as sum of irreducible representations of $S_n$, so it has a\nwell-defined Gelfand-Tsetlin basis up to scalars. The Fourier transform on the\nJohnson graph is defined as the change of basis matrix from the delta function\nbasis to the Gelfand-Tsetlin basis.\n  The direct application of this matrix to a generic vector requires\n$\\binom{n}{k}^2$ arithmetic operations. We show that --in analogy with the\nclassical Fast Fourier Transform on the discrete circle-- this matrix can be\nfactorized as a product of $n-1$ orthogonal matrices, each one with at most two\nnonzero elements in each column. This factorization shows that the number of\narithmetic operations required to apply this matrix to a generic vector is\nbounded above by $2(n-1) \\binom{n}{k}$. As a consequence, we show that the\nproblem of computing all the weights of the irreducible components of a given\nfunction can be solved in $O(n \\binom{n}{k})$ operations, improving the\nprevious bound $O(k^2 \\binom{n}{k})$ when $k$ asymptotically dominates\n$\\sqrt{n}$ in a non-uniform model of computation.

Here we come to the notion of weak\nequivalence of gradings: two gradings are weakly equivalent if there exists an\nisomorphism between the graded algebras that maps each graded component onto a\ngraded component. The following question arises naturally: when a group grading\non a finite dimensional algebra is weakly equivalent to a grading by a finite\ngroup? It turns out that this question can be reformulated purely group\ntheoretically in terms of the universal group of the grading. Namely, a grading\nis weakly equivalent to a grading by a finite group if and only if the\nuniversal group of the grading is residually finite with respect to a special\nsubset of the grading group. The same is true for all the coarsenings of the\ngrading if and only if the universal group of the grading is hereditarily\nresidually finite with respect to the same subset.

We arrive at this connection by reconsidering solvable lattice models\nknown as `metaplectic ice' whose partition functions are metaplectic Whittaker\nfunctions. First, we show that a certain Hecke action on metaplectic Whittaker\ncoinvariants agrees (up to twisting) with a Hecke action of Ginzburg,\nReshetikhin, and Vasserot. This allows us to expand the framework of KMS by\nDrinfeld twisting to introduce Gauss sums into the quantum wedge, which are\nnecessary for connections to metaplectic forms. Our main theorem interprets the\nrow transfer matrices of this ice model as `half' vertex operators on quantum\nFock space that intertwine with the action of\n$U_q(\\widehat{\\mathfrak{sl}}(n))$.\n  In the process, we introduce new symmetric functions termed\n\\textit{metaplectic symmetric functions} and explain how they relate to\nWhittaker functions on an $n$-fold metaplectic cover of GL$_r$.

New examples of structurable tori\nare obtained using a construction of structurable algebras from a semilinear\nversion of cubic forms satisfying the adjoint identity. The classification uses\ntechniques borrowed from quadratic forms over Z_2 and from the geometry of\ngeneralized quadrangles. Since structurable tori are the coordinate algebras\nfor the centreless cores of extended affine Lie algebras of type BC_1, the\nresults of this paper provide a classification and new examples for this class\nof Lie algebras. \n\n"}

We prove that\nif G is any finite real reflection group with Drinfel'd double D(G) over an\nalgebraically closed field k of characteristic not 2, then every simple\nD(G)-module has Frobenius-Schur indicator +1. This generalizes the classical\nresults for modules over the group itself. We also prove some new results about\nWeyl groups. In particular, we prove that any abelian subgroup is inverted by\nsome involution. Also, if E is any elementary abelian 2-subgroup of the Weyl\ngroup W, then all representations of the centralizer of E in W are defined over\nthe rational field. \n\n"}

(A\nciliated fat graph is a graph with a fixed linear order of ends of edges at\neach vertex.) Our aim is however to study the Poisson structure on the moduli\nspace of locally flat vector bundles on a Riemann surface with holes (i.e. with\nboundary). It is shown that this moduli space can be obtained as a quotient of\nthe space of graph connections by the Poisson action of a lattice gauge group\nendowed with a Poisson-Lie structure.

This paper uses uniform (and non-uniform)\nexpressions to define what is believed to be the usual intersection homology\n(and its local-global variant) of a convex polytope (or a projective toric\nvariety). Such expressions are generated by the facets, and so may lead to\nnecessary numerical conditions on the flag vector.
