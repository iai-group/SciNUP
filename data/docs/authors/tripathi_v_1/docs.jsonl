The one-quasiparticle wave function is identical\nto the corresponding CF wave function, and the two-quasiparticle wave function\nhas correct fractional charge and statistics and is numerically almost\nidentical to the corresponding CF wave function. We further show how to exactly\nrepresent the CF wavefunctions in the Jain series $\\nu = s/(2sp+1)$ as the CFT\ncorrelators of a new type of fermionic vertex operators, $V_{p,n}(z)$,\nconstructed from $n$ free compactified bosons; these operators provide the CFT\nrepresentation of composite fermions carrying $2p$ flux quanta in the $n^{\\rm\nth}$ CF Landau level.

Two complementary approaches are therefore\nintroduced, appropriate to low and high temperatures, which point to the same\nordered pattern.

Coulomb interactions couple the interfering edge mode to localized\nquasiparticle states in the bulk, whose occupation is quantized in integer\nvalues. For the integer quantum Hall effect, if the bulk-edge coupling is\nabsent, the resistance exhibits an Aharonov-Bohm (AB) periodicity, where the\nphase is equal to the number of quanta of magnetic flux enclosed by a specified\ninterferometer area. When bulk-edge coupling is present, the actual area of the\ninterferometer oscillates as function of B and V_G, with a combination of a\nsmooth variation and abrupt jumps due to changes in the number of\nquasi-particles in the bulk of the interferometer. This modulates the\nAharonov-Bohm phase and gives rise to additional periodicities in the\nresistance.

Their topological order can be\nrealized at room temperatures without magnetic fields and they can be turned\ninto magnets and exotic superconductors leading to world-wide interest and\nactivity in topological insulators. One of the major challenges in going from\nquantum Hall-like 2D states to 3D topological insulators is to develop new\nexperimental approaches/methods to precisely probe this novel form of\ntopological-order since the standard tools and settings that work for IQH-state\nalso work for QSH states. The method to probe 2D topological-order is\nexclusively with charge transport, which either measures quantized transverse\nconductance plateaus in IQH systems or longitudinal conductance in quantum spin\nHall (QSH) systems. In a 3D topological insulator, the boundary itself supports\na two dimensional electron gas (2DEG) and transport is not (Z$_2$)\ntopologically quantized.

In particular, they shown that, for local\nstabilizer codes in D spatial dimensions, locality preserving gates are\nrestricted to a set of unitary gates known as the D-th level of the Clifford\nhierarchy. In this paper, we elaborate this idea and provide several extensions\nand applications of their characterization in various directions. First, we\npresent a new no-go theorem for self-correcting quantum memory. Namely, we\nprove that a three-dimensional stabilizer Hamiltonian with a\nlocality-preserving implementation of a non-Clifford gate cannot have a\nmacroscopic energy barrier. Second, we prove that the code distance of a\nD-dimensional local stabilizer code with non-trivial locality-preserving m-th\nlevel Clifford logical gate is upper bounded by $O(L^{D+1-m})$. For codes with\nnon-Clifford gates (m>2), this improves the previous best bound by Bravyi and\nTerhal.

Besides the Hall\nconductance, the Hall viscosity is another example of such a response that\nmeasures how electronic wave functions respond to changes in the underlying\ngeometry. Topological (Chern) insulators are known to have a quantized Hall\nconductance. A natural question is how the Hall viscosity behaves for these\nmaterials. So far, most of studies on the Hall viscosity of Chern insulators\nhave focused on the continuum limit. The presence of lattice breaks the\ncontinuous translational symmetry to a discrete group and this causes two\ncomplications: it introduces a new length scale associated with the lattice\nconstant, and makes the momentum periodic. We develop two different methods of\nhow to implement a lattice deformation: (1) a lattice distortion is encoded as\na shift in the lattice momentum, and (2) a lattice deformation is treated\nmicroscopically in the gradient expansion of the hopping matrix elements. After\nestablishing the method of deformation we can compute the Hall viscosity\nthrough a linear response (Kubo) formula. We examine these methods for three\nmodels: the Hofstadter model, the Chern insulator, and the surface of a 3D\ntopological insulator.

In equilibrium\nthese edge-states lead to very specific transport properties, in particular the\ntwo-terminal conductivity of these systems is $2e^2/h$.

In the\nHartree-Fock approximation, at small $U$ we obtain a surface ferromagnetic\nphase through a continuous quantum phase transition characterized by the\nsurface-mode divergence of the spin susceptibility, while the bulk states\nremain very robust against local interactions and remain non-ordered. At\nslightly increased interaction strength, the system quickly changes from a\nsurface ferromagnetic phase to a surface charge-ordered phase through a\nfirst-order transition. When Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling is applied to the\nsurface states, a canted ferromagnetic phase occurs at the surface for\nintermediate values of $U$.

On one hand,\nfermionic edge modes are helical due to the nontrivial topology of the bulk. On\nthe other hand, a disorder at the edge or magnetic adatoms may produce a dense\narray of localized spins interacting with the helical electrons. The spin\nsubsystem is magnetically frustrated since the indirect exchange favors\nformation of helical spin order and the direct one favors (anti)ferromagnetic\nordering of the spins. At a moderately strong direct exchange, the competition\nbetween these spin interactions results in the spontaneous breaking of parity\nand in the Ising type order of the $z$-components at zero temperature. If the\ntotal spin is conserved the spin order does not pin a collective massless\nhelical mode which supports the ideal transport. In this case, the phase\ntransition converts the helical spin order to the order of a chiral lattice\nsupersolid.

The long time logarithmic relaxation rate\n(LTLRR), decreased from 10 K to 150 K and increased from 150 K to 195 K in\nLa0.5Ca0.5MnO3.

At 195 K, the magnetization first decreased, and after a\nfew minutes increased slowly as a function of time. Moreover, between 200 K and\n245 K, the magnetization increased throughout the measured time span. The\nchange in the slope of the curves, from negative to positive at about 200 K was\nfound to be related to the suppression of antiferromagnetic fluctuations in\nsmall magnetic fields.
