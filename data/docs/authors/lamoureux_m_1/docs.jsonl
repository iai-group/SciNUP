To further check against\npossible instrumental artifacts several upgrades to the PVLAS apparatus have\nbeen made during the last year. Two data taking runs, at the wavelength of 1064\nnm, have been performed in the new configuration with magnetic field strengths\nof 2.3 T and 5 T. The 2.3 T field value was chosen in order to avoid stray\nfields. The new observations do not show the presence of a rotation signal down\nto the levels of $1.2\\cdot 10^{-8}$ rad at 5 T and $1.0\\cdot 10^{-8}$ rad at\n2.3 T (at 95% c.l.) with 45000 passes in the magnetic field zone. In the same\nconditions no ellipticity signal was detected down to $1.4\\cdot 10^{-8}$ at 2.3\nT (at 95% c.l.), whereas at 5 T a signal is still present. The physical nature\nof this ellipticity as due to an effect depending on $B^2$ can be excluded by\nthe measurement at 2.3 T. These new results completely exclude the previously\npublished magnetically induced vacuum dichroism results, indicating that they\nwere instrumental artifacts. These new results therefore also exclude the\nparticle interpretation of the previous PVLAS results as due to a spin zero\nboson. The background ellipticity at 2.3 T can be used to determine a new limit\non the total photon-photon scattering cross section of $\\sigma_{\\gamma\\gamma} <\n4.5 \\cdot10^{-34}$ barn at 95% c.l.. \n\n"}

Here, I examine the prospects for reconstructing the\nlocal speed distribution of WIMPs in addition to WIMP particle-physics\nproperties (mass, cross sections) from next-generation cryogenic and\nliquid-noble direct-detection experiments. I find that the common method of\nfixing the form of the velocity distribution when estimating constraints on\nWIMP mass and cross sections means losing out on the information on the speed\ndistribution contained in the data and may lead to biases in the inferred\nvalues of the particle-physics parameters. I show that using a more general,\nempirical form of the speed distribution can lead to good constraints on the\nspeed distribution. Moreover, one can use Bayesian model-selection criteria to\ndetermine if a theoretically-inspired functional form for the speed\ndistribution (such as a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution) fits better than an\nempirical model. The shape of the degeneracy between WIMP mass and cross\nsections and their offset from the true values of those parameters depends on\nthe hypothesis for the speed distribution, which has significant implications\nfor consistency checks between direct-detection and collider data.

Present attempts are directed to\nextend the window of cosmic neutrino observation from low energies (Sun,\nsupernovae) to much higher energies. The aim is to study the most violent\nprocesses in the Universe which accelerate charged particles to highest\nenergies, far beyond the reach of laboratory experiments on Earth. These\nprocesses must be accompanied by the emission of neutrinos. Neutrinos are\nelectrically neutral and interact only weakly with ordinary matter; they thus\npropagate through the Universe without absorption or deflection, pointing back\nto their origin. Their feeble interaction, however, makes them extremely\ndifficult to detect. The years 2008-2010 have witnessed remarkable steps in\ndeveloping high energy neutrino telescopes. In 2010, the cubic-kilometre\nneutrino telescope IceCube at the South Pole has been completed. In the\nMediterranean Sea the first-generation neutrino telescope ANTARES takes data\nsince 2008, and efforts are directed towards KM3NeT, a telescope on the scale\nof several cubic kilometres. The next years will be key years for opening the\nneutrino window to the high energy Universe. With an instrumented volume of a\ncubic kilometre, IceCube is entering a region with realistic discovery\npotential. Discoveries or non-discoveries of IceCube will have a strong impact\non the future of the field and possibly mark a \"moment of truth\". In this\nreview, we discuss the scientific case for neutrino telescopes, describe the\ndetection principle and its implementation in first- and second-generation\ninstallations and finally collect the existing physics results and the\nexpectations for future detectors. We conclude with an outlook to alternative\ndetection methods, in particular for neutrinos of extremely high energies. \n\n"}

This kinematic region can be treated within an operator product\nexpansion and simplified using heavy quark symmetry, leading to systematic\npredictions for heavy-to-light processes such as B --> K^(*) l^+ l^-.

Abstract: The ATLAS and CMS collaborations have recently shown data suggesting the\npresence of a Higgs boson in the vicinity of 125 GeV. We show that a two-Higgs\ndoublet model spectrum, with the pseudo-scalar state being the lightest, could\nbe responsible for the diphoton signal events. In this model, the other scalars\nare considerably heavier and are not excluded by the current LHC data. If this\nassumption is correct, future LHC data should show a strengthening of the\n$\\gamma\\gamma$ signal, while the signals in the $ZZ^{(*)}\\to 4\\ell $ and\n$WW^{(*)}\\to 2\\ell 2\\nu$ channels should diminish and eventually disappear, due\nto the absence of diboson tree-level couplings of the CP-odd state. The heavier\nCP-even neutral scalars can now decay into channels involving the CP-odd light\nscalar which, together with their larger masses, allow them to avoid the\nexisting bounds on Higgs searches. We suggest additional signals to confirm\nthis scenario at the LHC, in the decay channels of the heavier scalars into\n$AA$ and $AZ$. Finally, this inverted two-Higgs doublet spectrum is\ncharacteristic in models where fermion condensation leads to electroweak\nsymmetry breaking. We show that in these theories it is possible to obtain the\nobserved diphoton signal at or somewhat above of the prediction for the\nstandard model Higgs for the typical values of the parameters predicted. \n\n"}

For such models the acceptances of the\nusual search strategies are significantly reduced due to requirement of large\neffective mass and missing E_T. On the other hand, lepton searches do have much\nlower thresholds for missing E_T and p_T of the final state objects. Therefore,\nif a model with a compressed mass spectrum allows for multi-lepton final\nstates, one could derive constraints using multi-lepton searches. For a class\nof simplified models we study the exclusion limits using ATLAS multi-lepton\nsearch analyses for the final states containing 2-4 electrons or muons with a\ntotal integrated luminosity of 1-2/fb at \\sqrt{s}=7 TeV. We also modify those\nanalyses by imposing additional cuts, so that their sensitivity to compressed\nsupersymmetric models increase.

Using\nBayesian inference makes it possible to take into account the theoretical\nuncertainties on the nuclear matrix elements in a fully consistent way. First,\nwe analyze the data used to claim the observation of neutrinoless double beta\ndecay in Ge-76, and find strong evidence (according to Jeffrey's scale) for a\npeak in the spectrum and moderate evidence for that the peak is actually close\nto the energy expected for the neutrinoless decay. We also find a significantly\nlarger statistical error than the original analysis, which we include in the\ncomparison with other data. Then, we statistically test the consistency between\nthis claim with that of recent measurements using Xe-136. We find that the two\ndata sets are about 40 to 80 times more probable under the assumption that they\nare inconsistent, depending on the nuclear matrix element uncertainties and the\nprior on the smallest neutrino mass. Hence, there is moderate to strong\nevidence of incompatibility, and for equal prior probabilities the posterior\nprobability of compatibility is between 1.3% and 2.5%. If one, despite such\nevidence for incompatibility, combines the two data sets, we find that the\ntotal evidence of neutrinoless double beta decay is negligible. If one ignores\nthe claim, there is weak evidence against the existence of the decay.

In\nthe CMSSM we show that ultimate, but realistic, improvement in the\ndetermination of the observable to about 5-10% around the Standard Model value\nwould strongly disfavor the A-funnel region, while not affecting much the other\nfavored regions. Second, we show that all the favored regions of the CMSSM will\nbe, for the most part, sensitive to direct dark matter searches in future\none-tonne detectors. A signal at low WIMP mass (<=450 GeV) and low\nspin-independent cross section would then strongly favor the stau\ncoannihilation region while a signal at higher WIMP mass (~800 GeV to ~1.2 TeV)\nwould clearly point to the region where the neutralino is higgsino-like with\nmass ~1 TeV.

We study minimal models with such couplings that explain dark matter\nas a thermal relic. The models contain a singlet dark matter particle with\ncubic renormalizable couplings between standard model particles and 'partner'\nparticles with the same gauge quantum numbers as the standard model particle.\nThe dark matter has spin 0, 1/2, or 1, and may or may not be its own\nantiparticle. Each model has 3 parameters: the masses of the dark matter and\nstandard model partners, and the cubic coupling. Requiring the correct relic\nabundance gives a 2-dimensional parameter space where collider and direct\ndetection constraints can be directly compared. We focus on the case of dark\nmatter interactions with colored particles. We find that collider and direct\ndetection searches are remarkably complementary for these models. Direct\ndetection limits for the cases where the dark matter is not its own\nantiparticle require dark matter masses to be in the multi-TeV range, where\nthey are extremely difficult to probe in collider experiments. The models where\ndark matter is its own antiparticle are strongly constrained by collider\nsearches for monojet and jets + MET signals. These models are constrained by\ndirect detection mainly near the limit where the dark matter and partner masses\nare nearly degenerate, where collider searches become more difficult. \n\n"}

The\nmeasurements are sensitive to invariant masses between 70 GeV and 4.27 TeV with\ncenter-of-mass jet rapidities up to 3.5. A novel technique to correct jets for\npile-up (additional proton-proton collisions) in the 2011 data is developed and\nsubsequently used in the measurement. The data are found to be consistent with\nfixed-order NLO pQCD predictions provided by NLOJET++. The results constitute a\nstringent test of pQCD, in an energy regime previously unexplored.

It was recently proposed that the $Y(4260)$ should have a\nprominent $D_1\\bar{D}+c.c.$ molecular component that is strongly correlated\nwith the production of the charged $Z_c(3900)$. In this paper we demonstrate\nthat the nontrivial cross section line shapes of $e^+e^-\\to J/\\psi\\pi\\pi$ and\n$h_c\\pi\\pi$ can be naturally explained by the molecular scenario.

It is TeV-scale dark\nmatter, however, that remains viable for many models of supersymmetry. In this\npaper, we study the reach of a 100 TeV proton-proton collider for neutralino\ndark matter and compare to 14 TeV LHC projections. We employ a supersymmetric\nsimplified model approach and present reach estimates from monojet searches,\nsoft lepton searches, and disappearing track searches. The searches are applied\nto pure neutralino spectra, compressed neutralino spectra, and coannihilating\nspectra. We find a factor of 4-5 improvement in mass reach in going from 14 TeV\nto 100 TeV. More specifically, we find that given a 1% systematic uncertainty,\na 100 TeV collider could exclude winos up to 1.4 TeV and higgsinos up to 850\nGeV in the monojet channel. Coannihilation scenarios with gluinos can be\nexcluded with neutralino masses of 6.2 TeV, with stops at 2.8 TeV, and with\nsquarks at 4.0 TeV.

We\nemphasize the importance of anomalous single top plus Higgs production in these\nscenarios, in addition to the more widely studied $t \\to h j$ decays. By\nrecasting existing CMS searches in multilepton and diphoton plus lepton final\nstates, we show that bounds on $tuh$ couplings are improved by a factor of 1.5\nwhen single top plus Higgs production is accounted for.

If such a prediction is possible, we\ncorrespondingly propose a prediction in this study that the thermal radiation\nappears in the inertial frame from an electron heated by the Unruh effect in\nthe accelerating frame. The point in our prediction is, although the Unruh\neffect is only in the accelerating frame, if the appearance of the Brownian\nmotion rooted in the Unruh effect in the inertial frame can be predicted, the\nheat that the particle gets in its body by the Unruh effect in the accelerating\nframe could survive in the inertial frame.

We provide a full comparison amongst the\nrelated operator algebras. For our analysis we isolate a partially defined\ndynamical system, to which we refer as the {\\em quantised dynamics} of the\nmonomial ideal.\n  In addition we revisit several previously considered constructions. These\ninclude Matsumoto's subshift C*-algebras, as well as the tensor and the Pimsner\nalgebras associated with dynamical systems or graphs. We sort out the various\nrelations by giving concrete conditions and counterexamples that orientate the\noperator algebras of our context.\n  It appears that the boundary C*-algebras do not arise as the quotient with\nthe compact operators unconditionally. We establish a dichotomy to this effect\nby examining the resulting tensor algebras. We identify their boundary\nrepresentations, we analyse their C*-envelopes, and we give criteria for\nhyperrigidity. Moreover we completely classify them in terms of the data\nprovided by the monomial ideals. For tensor algebras of C*-correspondences and\nbounded isomorphisms this is achieved up to the level of local conjugacy (in\nthe sense of Davidson and Roydor) for the quantised dynamics. For tensor\nalgebras of subproduct systems and algebraic isomorphisms this is achieved up\nto the level of equality of monomial ideals modulo permutations of the\nvariables.\n  In the process we accomplish more in different directions. Most notably we\nshow that tensor algebras form a complete invariant for isomorphic (resp.\nsimilar) subproduct systems of homogeneous ideals up to isometric (resp.\nbounded) isomorphisms.\n  The results on local conjugacy are obtained via an alternative proof of the\nbreakthrough result of Davidson and Katsoulis on piecewise conjugate systems.\nFor our purposes we use appropriate compressions of the Fock representation. We\nthen apply this alternative proof locally for the partially defined quantised\ndynamics. In this way we avoid the topological graphs machinery and pave the\nway for further applications.

In measurements of\nthe basic weak muon capture reaction on the proton to determine the\npseudoscalar coupling g_P, capture occurs from both atomic and molecular\nstates. Thus knowledge of \\lambda_pp\\mu\\ is required for a correct\ninterpretation of these experiments.\n  Purpose: Recently the MuCap experiment has measured the capture rate\n\\Lambda_S from the singlet p\\mu\\ atom, employing a low density active target to\nsuppress pp\\mu\\ formation (PRL 110, 12504 (2013)). Nevertheless, given the\nunprecedented precision of this experiment, the existing experimental knowledge\nin \\lambda_pp\\mu\\ had to be improved.\n  Method: The MuCap experiment derived the weak capture rate from the muon\ndisappearance rate in ultra-pure hydrogen. By doping the hydrogen with 20 ppm\nof argon, a competing process to pp\\mu\\ formation was introduced, which allowed\nthe extraction of \\lambda_pp\\mu\\ from the observed time distribution of decay\nelectrons.\n  Results: The pp\\mu\\ formation rate was measured as \\lambda_pp\\mu = (2.01 +-\n0.06(stat) +- 0.03(sys)) 10^6 s^-1.

Our LHC Run II search proposals utilize\nsignatures with large missing energy and leptons, as well as jet substructure\nobservables for tagging of boosted heavy SM states, customized $b$-tagging\ntactics and forward jet tagging. We analyze the prospects for discovery and\nexclusion of $T'$ models within the framework of partially composite quarks at\nthe LHC Run II. Our results show that the LHC Run II has good prospects for\nobserving $T'$ models which predict single production cross section of\n$\\sigma_{T'} \\sim 70 -140 \\, (30 -65)$ fb for $M_{T'} = 1\\, (1.5)$~TeV\nrespectively with 100 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity, depending on the\nbranching ratios of the $T'$.

High experimental sensitivity can be achieved using a\ncombination of high neutron-gamma discrimination using 6 LiF:ZnS(Ag) and\nprecise localisation of the inverse beta decay products. This compact detector\nsystem requires limited passive shielding as it relies on spacial topology to\ndetermine the different classes of backgrounds.

A phased\nthree tonne experimental deployment will begin in the second half of 2016,\nallowing a precise search for oscillations that will resolve the reactor\nanomaly using a three tonne detector running for three years. In this talk the\nnovel detector design is explained and initial detector performance results\nfrom the module level deployment are presented along with an estimation of the\nphysics reach of the next phase. \n\n"}

For the first time, we investigate the properties of the color\nattractive configuration of a triquark and we define a nonlocal light cone\ndistribution amplitude for pentaquark states, where both diquark and triquark\nare not pointlike, but they have nonzero size.

Such measurements can be used to study and constrain parton\ndistribution functions, as well as to test perturbative quantum chromodynamics\nin hard scattering processes.

A\nclassification variable built from spectral information was able to achieve an\nunprecedented performance, despite the lack of optimization at the detector\ndesign level. Several examples of event classification are provided, ranging\nfrom differentiation between the detector volumes and an efficient rejection of\ninstrumental light noise, to some sensitivity to the particle type, such as\nstopping muons, ortho-positronium formation, alpha particles as well as\nelectrons and positrons.

Jet grooming is a recursive procedure which sequentially\nremoves soft constituents of a jet until a pair of hard subjets is found. The\nresulting groomed jets can be used to study modifications to the parton shower\nevolution in the presence of the hot and dense medium created in heavy ion\ncollisions. Predictions of groomed jet properties from the PYTHIA and HERWIG++\nevent generators agree with the measurements in pp collisions.

In pp collisions,\nthe measurement of heavy-flavour hadron production provides a reference for\nheavy-ion studies, and allows also testing perturbative QCD calculations in a\nwide range of collision energies. Similar studies in p--Pb collisions help in\ndisentangling cold nuclear matter effects from modifications induced by the\npresence of a QGP medium, and are also useful to investigate the possible\nexistence of collective phenomena also in this system.

A\nsystematic treatment of the various Higgs decay channels and their interplay\nhas been lacking due to the seemingly large number of free parameters in the\nNMSSM's Higgs sector. We demonstrate that due to the SM-like nature of the\nobserved Higgs boson, the NMSSM's Higgs and neutralino sectors have highly\ncorrelated masses and couplings and can effectively be described by four\nphysically intuitive parameters: the physical masses of the two CP-odd states\nand their mixing angle, and $\\tan\\beta$, which plays a minor role.

This is\nbecause in such decay modes lepton number conservation would be violated and\nthe neutrino would reveal itself as being its own antiparticle, thereby of\nMajorana type. So far, the experimental focus has mostly been on the double\nbeta minus decay variant, where one attempts to measure the spectrum of the two\nemitted electrons.

The difference with respect to the well-known resonance\n$D0$, also neutral and with the same quark composition, is that the two quarks\nhave an orbital momentum 1, which increases their binding energy. Therefore the\nmass is larger than that of the $D0$. Since the relative orientation of the\nspin is the same, in the limit of very large charm mass, the masses of these\nresonances should be the same; their small difference is predicted by theory\nand therefore important to measurement to distinguish the different models.\n  These states have been observed in their decay into a kaon and three pions;\ntwo of these particles are required to originate from a displaced vertex with\nrespect to the primary interaction vertex, to account for the longer lifetime\nof the charmed mesons.

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) may thus turn into a\nfactory of black holes, at which their production and evaporation may be\nstudied in detail. But even before the LHC starts operating, the Pierre Auger\nObservatory for cosmic rays, presently under construction, has an opportunity\nto search for black hole signatures. Black hole production in the scattering of\nultrahigh energy cosmic neutrinos on nucleons in the atmosphere may initiate\nquasi-horizontal air showers far above the Standard Model rate. In this letter,\nwe compare the sensitivity of LHC and Auger to black hole production by\nstudying their respective reach in black hole production parameter space.\nMoreover, we present constraints in this parameter space from the\nnon-observation of horizontal showers by the Fly's Eye collaboration.

Traces of\nvertex operators can be used for calculation of correlation functions and\nformfactors of integrable models (XXZ, Sine-Gordon, etc.), that is why we are\ninterested in this problem. Also we show that Fredholm's minor and determinant\ncan be expressed by such traces. We obtain a short proof of the Fredholm's\nformula for the solution of an integral equation. Analogue of Fredholm's\nformula in terms of permanents is obtained. \n\n"}
