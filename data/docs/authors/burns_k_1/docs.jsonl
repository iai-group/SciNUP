We\ncalculate the coupling of the radion in such scenarios to bulk fermion and\ngauge modes. Special attention needs to be devoted to the coupling to massless\ngauge fields (photon, gluon), since it is well known that loop effects may be\nimportant for these fields. We also present a detailed explanation of these\ncouplings from the CFT interpretation. We then use these couplings to determine\nthe radion branching fractions and discuss some of the discovery potential of\nthe LHC for the radion. We find that the gamma-gamma signal is enhanced over\nmost of the range of the radion mass over the gamma-gamma signal of a SM Higgs,\nas long as the RS scale is sufficiently low. However, the signal significance\ndepends strongly on free parameters that characterize the magnitude of bare\nbrane-localized kinetic terms for the massless gauge fields. In the absence of\nsuch terms, the signal can be be enhanced over the traditional RS1 models\n(where all standard model fields are localized on the IR brane), but the signal\ncan also be reduced compared to RS1 if the brane localized terms are sizeable.\nWe also show that for larger radion masses, where the gamma-gamma signal is no\nlonger significant, one can use the usual 4 lepton signal to discover the\nradion. \n\n"}

By including the BP process into the conservation laws of mass,\nangular momentum and energy, we derive the expressions of the BP power and disk\nluminosity, and the jet power is regarded as the sum of the BZ and BP powers.\n  Results. We find that the disk radiation flux and luminosity decrease because\na fraction of the accretion energy is channelled into the outflow/jet in the BP\nprocess.

Given their\nredshifts, they have AGN bolometric luminosities of ~1e45-1e47 erg/s comparable\nto powerful QSOs. This, coupled with their high IR-to-optical ratios and often\nsignificant silicate absorption, strongly argues in favor of these mid-IR\nobjects being heavily obscured QSOs. At X-ray energies, we marginally detect\ntwo ULIRGs, while the rest have only upper limits. Using the IRS-derived 5.8um\nAGN continuum luminosity as a proxy for the expected X-ray luminosities, we\nfind that all of the observed sources must individually be highly obscured,\nwhile X-ray stacking limits on the undetected sources suggest that the\nmajority, if not all, are likely to be at least mildly Compton-thick (NH>1e24\ncm-2). With a space density of ~1.4e-7 Mpc-3 at z~2, such objects imply a lower\nlimit on the obscured AGN fraction (i.e., the ratio of AGN above and below\nNH=1e22 cm-2) of >~1.7:1 even among luminous QSOs. Our findings, which are\nbased on extensive multi-wavelength constraints including Spitzer IRS spectra,\nshould aid in the interpretation of similar objects from larger or deeper\nmid-IR surveys, where considerable uncertainty about the source properties\nremains and comparable follow-up is not yet feasible. \n\n"}

However, lipid membranes in their chain melting regime are known\nto be highly permeable to ions, water and small molecules, and are therefore\nnot always inert. In voltage-clamp experiments one finds quantized conduction\nevents through protein-free membranes in their melting regime similar to or\neven undistinguishable from those attributed to proteins.

Some of these results had been announced much\nearlier by Bell but without accessible proofs. We define the concept of the\nvariation of a map on a simple closed curve and relate it to the index of the\nmap on that curve: Index = Variation + 1. A fixed point theorem for positively\noriented, perfect maps of the plane is obtained. This generalizes results\nannounced by Bell in 1982. A continuous map of an interval to the real line\nwhich sends the endpoints in opposite directions has a fixed point. We\ngeneralize this to maps on non-invariant continua in the plane under positively\noriented maps of the plane (with appropriate boundary conditions). These\nmethods imply that in some cases non-invariant continua in the plane are\ndegenerate. This has important applications in complex dynamics.

The decay-rate of this\nmetastable state is governed by {\\it Fermi's Golden Rule}, $\\Gamma[V]$, which\ndepends on the potential $V$ and the details of the forcing. We pose the\npotential design problem: find $V_{opt}$ which minimizes $\\Gamma[V]$ (maximizes\nthe lifetime of the state) over an admissible class of potentials with fixed\nspatial support. We formulate this problem as a constrained optimization\nproblem and prove that an admissible optimal solution exists. Then, using\nquasi-Newton methods, we compute locally optimal potentials. These have the\nstructure of a truncated periodic potential with a localized defect. In\ncontrast to optimal structures for other spectral optimization problems, our\noptimizing potentials appear to be interior points of the constraint set and to\nbe smooth. The multi-scale structures that emerge incorporate the physical\nmechanisms of energy confinement via material contrast and interference\neffects.\n  An analysis of locally optimal potentials reveals local optimality is\nattained via two mechanisms: (i) decreasing the density of states near a\nresonant frequency in the continuum and (ii) tuning the oscillations of\nextended states to make $\\Gamma[V]$, an oscillatory integral, small. Our\napproach achieves lifetimes, $\\sim (\\epsilon^2\\Gamma[V])^{-1}$, for locally\noptimal potentials with $\\Gamma^{-1}\\sim\\mathcal{O}(10^{9})$ as compared with\n$\\Gamma^{-1}\\sim \\mathcal{O}(10^{2})$ for a typical potential. Finally, we\nexplore the performance of optimal potentials via simulations of the\ntime-evolution. \n\n"}

The processes by which gravitational\nenergy is converted into turbulent and magnetic energies, however, remain\npoorly understood. Here, we show with high-resolution, adaptive-mesh\nsimulations that MHD turbulence is efficiently driven by extracting energy from\nthe gravitational potential during the collapse of a dense gas cloud.\nCompressible motions generated during the contraction are converted into\nsolenoidal, turbulent motions, leading to a natural energy ratio of E_sol/E_tot\nof approximately 2/3. We find that the energy injection scale of gravity-driven\nturbulence is close to the local Jeans scale. If small seeds of the magnetic\nfield are present, they are amplified exponentially fast via the small-scale\ndynamo process. The magnetic field grows most efficiently on the smallest\nscales, for which the stretching, twisting, and folding of field lines, and the\nturbulent vortices are sufficiently resolved. We find that this scale\ncorresponds to about 30 grid cells in the simulations. We thus suggest a new\nminimum resolution criterion of 30 cells per Jeans length in\n(magneto)hydrodynamical simulations of self-gravitating gas, in order to\nresolve turbulence on the Jeans scale, and to capture minimum dynamo\namplification of the magnetic field. Due to numerical diffusion, however, any\nexisting simulation today can at best provide lower limits on the physical\ngrowth rates.

The\nexistence and structure of the NSSL cannot be attributed to the conservation of\nangular momentum by solar surface convection, as is often supposed. Rather, the\nturbulent angular momentum transport accounts for the poleward meridional flow\nwhile the often overlooked meridional force balance maintains the mid-latitude\nrotational shear. We suggest that the base of the NSSL is marked by a\ntransition from baroclinic to turbulent stresses in the meridional plane which\nsuppress Coriolis-induced circulations that would otherwise establish a\ncylindrical rotation profile.

A Bradbury Nielsen gate\nconsists of two interleaved sets of electrodes. If two voltages of the same\namplitude but opposite polarity are applied the gate is closed, and for\nidentical (zero) potential the gate is open. Whereas former realizations of the\ndevice employ actual wires resulting in difficulties with winding, fixing and\ntensioning them, our approach is to use two grids photo-etched from a metallic\nfoil. This design allows for simplified construction of gates covering large\nbeam sizes up to at least 900\\,mm$^2$ with variable wire spacing down to\n250\\,\\textmu m.

An approximate analytic\nexpression for R_c is derived for an ideal gas equation of state and a simple\n(power-law-Arrhenius) reaction law, and shown to reproduce the results of\nnumerical solutions. For typical acetylene-air experiments we find R_c~0.1 mm\n(spherical) and R_c~1 mm (cylindrical). We suggest that the deflagration to\ndetonation transition (DDT) observed in these systems may be due to converging\nshocks produced by the turbulent deflagration flow, which reaches sub (but\nnear) sonic velocities on scales >>R_c. Our suggested mechanism differs from\nthat proposed by Zel'dovich et al., in which a fine-tuned spatial gradient in\nthe chemical induction time is required to be maintained within the turbulent\ndeflagration flow. Our analysis may be readily extended to more complicated\nequations of state and reaction laws.

The goal is to provide\na rigorous methodology for verifying a code on two dimensional Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability. We ran the problem in the Pencil Code, Athena, Enzo, NDSPHMHD, and\nPhurbas. A strict comparison, judgment, or ranking, between codes is beyond the\nscope of this work, though this work provides the mathematical framework needed\nfor such a study. Nonetheless, how the test is posed circumvents the issues\nraised by tests starting from a sharp contact discontinuity yet it still shows\nthe poor performance of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics.

Now stars which fulfil the escape criterion\nare not removed immediately, but can stay in the system for a certain time\nwhich depends on the excess of the energy of a star above the escape energy.\nThey are called potential escapers.

We find a significant fraction of sources with inverted spectral indices\nthat all have 1.4 GHz fluxes less than 10 mJy, and are therefore too faint to\nhave been detected and included in previous radio source count models that are\nmatched at multiple frequencies. Combined with the matched source population at\n1.4 and 5 GHz in 1 sq. deg. in the ATESP survey, we update models for the 5 GHz\ndifferential number counts and distributions of spectral indices in 5 GHz flux\nbins that can be used to estimate the unresolved point source contribution to\nthe cosmic microwave background temperature anisotropies. We find a shallower\nlogarithmic slope in the 5 GHz differential counts than in previously published\nmodels for fluxes < 100 mJy as well as larger fractions of inverted spectral\nindices at these fluxes. Because the Planck flux limit for resolved sources is\nlarger than 100 mJy in all channels, our modified number counts yield at most a\n10% change in the predicted Poisson contribution to the Planck temperature\npower spectrum.

In our library, not only\nthe Newton's forces, but also central forces with an arbitrary shape f(r),\nwhich has a finite cutoff radius r_cut (i.e. f(r)=0 at r>r_cut), can be quickly\ncomputed. Using an Intel Core i7--2600 processor, we measure the performance of\nour library for both the forces. In the case of Newton's forces, we achieve 2 x\n10^9 interactions per second with 1 processor core, which is 20 times higher\nthan the performance of an implementation without any explicit use of SIMD\ninstructions, and 2 times than that with the SSE instructions. With 4 processor\ncores, we obtain the performance of 8 x 10^9 interactions per second. In the\ncase of the arbitrarily shaped forces, we can calculate 1 x 10^9 and 4 x 10^9\ninteractions per second with 1 and 4 processor cores, respectively. The\nperformance with 1 processor core is 6 times and 2 times higher than those of\nthe implementations without any use of SIMD instructions and with the SSE\ninstructions. These performances depend weakly on the number of particles. It\nis good contrast with the fact that the performance of force calculations\naccelerated by GPUs depends strongly on the number of particles. Substantially\nweak dependence of the performance on the number of particles is suitable to\ncollisionless N-body simulations, since these simulations are usually performed\nwith sophisticated N-body solvers such as Tree- and TreePM-methods combined\nwith an individual timestep scheme.

We follow the\nthermal evolution of the gas down to ~5K using extinction-dependent heating and\ncooling functions. We do not yet include magnetic fields or localized stellar\nfeedback, so the evolution of the GMCs and clumps is determined solely by\nself-gravity balanced by thermal and turbulent pressure support and the large\nscale galactic shear.

We implement star formation at a slow, inefficient rate of 2%\nper local free-fall time, but even this yields global star formation rates that\nare about two orders of magnitude larger than the observed Kennicutt-Schmidt\nrelation due to over-production of dense gas clumps.

Our investigation\nis focused on the entrainment process at the top convection boundary and on the\nsubsequent advection of H-rich material into deeper layers, and we therefore\nignore the burning of the proton-rich fuel in this study. We find that, for our\ndeep convection zone, coherent convective motions of near global scale appear\nto dominate the flow. At the top boundary convective shear flows are stable\nagainst Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities.

In the past ten years, neutrino oscillation\nexperiments have finally provided the incontrovertible evidence that neutrinos\nmix and have finite masses. These results represent the strongest demonstration\nthat the Standard Model of electroweak interactions is incomplete and that new\nPhysics beyond it must exist. None of these experimental efforts could however\nshade light on some of the basic features of neutrinos. Indeed, absolute scale\nand ordering of the masses of the three generations as well as charge\nconjugation and lepton number conservation properties are still unknown. In\nthis scenario, a unique role is played by the Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay\nsearches: these experiments can probe lepton number conservation, investigate\nthe Dirac/Majorana nature of the neutrinos and their absolute mass scale\n(hierarchy problem) with unprecedented sensitivity. Today Neutrinoless Double\nBeta Decay faces a new era where large scale experiments with a sensitivity\napproaching the so-called degenerate-hierarchy region are nearly ready to start\nand where the challenge for the next future is the construction of detectors\ncharacterized by a tonne-scale size and an incredibly low background, to fully\nprobe the inverted-hierarchy region.

This suggests both valley-\nand spin-switch effects between the perfect elastic CT and perfect CAR\nprocesses and makes the nonlocal charge current to be fully valley- and\nspin-polarized inside the right F region where the type of the polarizations\ncan be changed by reversing the magnetization direction in the right F region.\nWe further demonstrate that the presence of the strong spin-orbit interaction\n$\\lambda$ and an additional topological term ($\\beta$) in the Hamiltonian of\nMoS$_2$ result in an enhancement of the charge conductance of the CT and CAR\nprocesses and make them to be present for long lengths of the superconducting\nregion.

In the $n$-dimensional\nsetting, however, it requires the inversion of an $n \\times n$ covariance\nmatrix, $C$, as well as the evaluation of its determinant, $\\det(C)$. In many\ncases, such as regression using Gaussian processes, the covariance matrix is of\nthe form $C = \\sigma^2 I + K$, where $K$ is computed using a specified\ncovariance kernel which depends on the data and additional parameters\n(hyperparameters). The matrix $C$ is typically dense, causing standard direct\nmethods for inversion and determinant evaluation to require $\\mathcal O(n^3)$\nwork. This cost is prohibitive for large-scale modeling.

It is demonstrated that, while the\nmagnetic helicity is gauge-dependent, its value in any gauge may be physically\ninterpreted as the average winding number among all pairs of field lines with\nrespect to some orthonormal frame field. In fact, the choice of gauge is\nequivalent to the choice of reference field in the relative helicity, meaning\nthat the magnetic helicity is no less physically meaningful. We prove that a\nparticular gauge always measures the winding with respect to a fixed frame, and\npropose that this is normally the best choice. For periodic fields, this choice\nis equivalent to measuring relative helicity with respect to a potential\nreference field. But for aperiodic fields, we show that the potential field can\nbe twisted. We prove by construction that there always exists a possible\nuntwisted reference field. \n\n"}

Despite their importance, we have not been able to fully\nquantify the impact of jets and outflows during the formation of a star\ncluster. The main problem lies in limited computing power. We would have to\nresolve the magnetic jet-launching mechanism close to the protostar and at the\nsame time follow the evolution of a parsec-size cloud for a million years.\nCurrent computer power and codes fall orders of magnitude short of achieving\nthis. In order to overcome this problem, we implement a subgrid-scale (SGS)\nmodel for launching jets and outflows, which demonstrably converges and\nreproduces the mass, linear and angular momentum transfer, and the speed of\nreal jets, with ~ 1000 times lower resolution than would be required without\nSGS model.

These residual impairments have fundamental impact on\nthe MIMO system performance. However, most of the previous works have neglected\nthis factor. In this paper, a training-based MIMO system with residual transmit\nRF impairments (RTRI) is considered.

We find that the fastest\ngrowing linear MRI structures on both local and global domains can look very\ndifferent to the eigenmodes, invariably resembling waves shearing with the\nbackground flow (shear waves). In addition, such structures can grow many times\nfaster than the least stable eigenmode over long time periods, and be localized\nin a completely different region of space.

An important component\nof the strategy of our proof comes from the rectifiability techniques of Mayer\nand Urba\\'nski ('03), who obtained a dimension rigidity result for conformal\niterated function systems (including those with infinite alphabets). In order\nto handle the infinite dimensional case, both for Kleinian groups and for\niterated function systems, we introduce the notion of pseudorectifiability, a\nvariant of rectifiability, and develop a theory around this notion similar to\nthe theory of rectifiable sets.\n  Our approach also extends existing results in the finite-dimensional case,\nwhere it unifies the realms of Kleinian groups, conformal iterated function\nsystems, and rational functions.

The MHD equations are\nsecond-order consistent and conservative. We augment these with a\ndivergence-cleaning scheme, which maintains div*B~0 to high accuracy. We\nimplement these in the code GIZMO, together with a state-of-the-art\nimplementation of SPH MHD. In every one of a large suite of test problems, the\nnew methods are competitive with moving-mesh and AMR schemes using constrained\ntransport (CT) to ensure div*B=0. They are able to correctly capture the growth\nand structure of the magneto-rotational instability (MRI), MHD turbulence, and\nthe launching of magnetic jets, in some cases converging more rapidly than AMR\ncodes. Compared to SPH, the MFM/MFV methods exhibit proper convergence at fixed\nneighbor number, sharper shock capturing, and dramatically reduced noise, div*B\nerrors, and diffusion.

As a result they converge more slowly on\nsome problems (involving smooth, slowly-moving flows) but more rapidly on\nothers (involving advection or rotation).

{"id": "1509.07877", "contents": "Title: A Constrained-Gradient Method to Control Divergence Errors in Numerical\n  MHD Abstract: In numerical magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), a major challenge is maintaining\nzero magnetic field-divergence (div-B). Constrained transport (CT) schemes can\nachieve this at high accuracy, but have generally been restricted to very\nspecific methods. For more general (meshless, moving-mesh, or ALE) methods,\n'divergence-cleaning' schemes reduce the div-B errors, however they can still\nbe significant, especially at discontinuities, and can lead to systematic\ndeviations from correct solutions which converge away very slowly. Here we\npropose a new constrained gradient (CG) scheme which augments these with a\nhybrid projection step, and can be applied to any numerical scheme with a\nreconstruction. This iteratively approximates the least-squares minimizing,\nglobally divergence-free reconstruction of the fluid. We emphasize that, unlike\n'locally divergence free' methods, this actually minimizes the numerically\nunstable div-B terms, without affecting the convergence order of the method. We\nimplement this in the mesh-free code GIZMO and compare a wide range of test\nproblems. Compared to state-of-the-art cleaning schemes, our CG method reduces\nthe maximum div-B errors in each problem by 1-3 orders of magnitude (2-5 dex\nbelow the typical errors if no div-B cleaning is used). By preventing large\ndiv-B even at unresolved discontinuities, the method eliminates systematic\nerrors at jumps. In every problem, the accuracy of our CG results is comparable\nto CT methods. The cost is modest, ~30% of the hydro algorithm, and the CG\ncorrection can be easily implemented in a wide range of different numerical MHD\nmethods. While for many problems, we find Dedner-type cleaning schemes are\nsufficient for good results, we identify a wide range of problems where using\nonly the simplest Powell or '8-wave' cleaning can produce systematic,\norder-of-magnitude errors. \n\n"}

In primarily neutral regions, dust grains move as aerodynamic particles,\nnot necessarily with the gas. We therefore directly simulate, for the first\ntime, the behavior of aerodynamic grains in highly supersonic,\nmagnetohydrodynamic turbulence typical of MCs. We show that, under these\nconditions, grains with sizes a >0.01 micron exhibit dramatic (exceeding factor\n~1000) fluctuations in the local dust-to-gas ratio (implying large small-scale\nvariations in abundances, dust cooling rates, and dynamics). The dust can form\nhighly filamentary structures (which would be observed in both dust emission\nand extinction), which can be much thinner than the characteristic width of gas\nfilaments. Sometimes, the dust and gas filaments are not even in the same\nlocation. The 'clumping factor' of the dust (critical for dust\ngrowth/coagulation/shattering) can reach ~100, for grains in the ideal size\nrange. The dust clustering is maximized around scales ~0.2pc*(a/micron)*(100\ncm^-3/n_gas), and is 'averaged out' on larger scales. However, because the\ndensity varies widely in supersonic turbulence, the dynamic range of scales\n(and interesting grain sizes) for these fluctuations is much broader than in\nthe subsonic case.

The\nW-band is close to optimal in terms of contamination of the CMB from Galactic\nsynchrotron, free-free, and thermal interstellar dust. In this band, the\natmosphere has very good transparency, allowing interesting ground-based\nobservations with large (>30 m) telescopes, achieving high angular resolution\n(<0.4 arcmin). In this work we describe the startup measurements devoted to the\noptimization of a W-band camera/spectrometer prototype for large aperture\ntelescopes like the 64 m SRT (Sardinia Radio Telescope). In the process of\nselecting the best superconducting film for the LEKID, we characterized a 40 nm\nthick Aluminum 2-pixel array. We measured the minimum frequency able to break\nCPs (i.e. $h\\nu=2\\Delta\\left(T_{c}\\right)=3.5k_{B}T_{c}$) obtaining $\\nu=95.5$\nGHz, that corresponds to a critical temperature of 1.31 K. This is not suitable\nto cover the entire W-band.

{"id": "1601.06348", "contents": "Title: A new simple dynamo model for stellar activity cycle Abstract: A new simple dynamo model for stellar activity cycle is proposed. By\nconsidering an inhomogeneous mean flow effect on turbulence, it is shown that\nturbulent cross helicity (velocity--magnetic-field correlation) should enter\nthe expression of turbulent electromotive force as the coupling coefficient for\nthe mean absolute vorticity. The inclusion of the cross-helicity effect makes\nthe present model different from the current $\\alpha$--$\\Omega$-type models\nmainly in two points. First, in addition to the usual $\\alpha$ (helicity\neffect) and $\\beta$ (turbulent magnetic diffusivity), we consider the $\\gamma$\ncoefficient (cross-helicity effect) as a key ingredient of the dynamo process.\nSecond, unlike the $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ coefficients, which are often treated\nas an adjustable parameter in the current studies, the spatiotemporal evolution\nof $\\gamma$ coefficient is solved simultaneously with the mean magnetic-field\nequations. The basic scenario is as follows: In the presence of turbulent cross\nhelicity, the toroidal field is induced by the toroidal rotation in mediation\nby the turbulent cross helicity. The $\\alpha$ effect generates the poloidal\nfield from the toroidal one. This poloidal field produces a turbulent cross\nhelicity whose sign is opposite to the original one. Then a cycle of reversal\ncompletes. Eigenvalue analyses of the simplest possible present model give a\nbutterfly diagram, which confirms the above scenario as well as the\nequator-ward migrations, the phase relationship between the cross helicity and\nmagnetic fields, etc. These results suggest that the oscillation of the\nturbulent cross helicity is a key for the activity cycle. The reversal of the\nturbulent cross helicity is not the result of the magnetic-field reversal, but\nthe cause of the latter. This new model is expected to open up the possibility\nof the mean-field or turbulence closure dynamo approaches. \n\n"}

Mainly three particular profiles are considered: the Rayleigh limit,\nquasi-Keplerian, and solid-body rotation. In each case we begin by computing\nlinear instability curves and their dependence on the magnetic Prandtl number\nPm. For the azimuthal wavenumber m=1 modes, the instability curves always scale\nwith the Reynolds number and the Hartmann number. For sufficiently small Pm\nthese modes therefore only become unstable for magnetic Mach numbers less than\nunity, and are thus not relevant for most astrophysical applications. However,\nmodes with m>10 can behave very differently. For sufficiently flat profiles,\nthey scale with the magnetic Reynolds number and the Lundquist number, thereby\nallowing instability also for the large magnetic Mach numbers of astrophysical\nobjects. We further compute fully nonlinear, three-dimensional equilibration of\nthese instabilities, and investigate how the energy is distributed among the\nazimuthal (m) and axial (k) wavenumbers. In comparison spectra become steeper\nfor large m, reflecting the smoothing action of shear.

For transmission\nover a $q$-ary erasure channel, they also derived a closed-form recursion for\nthe erasure probability of each effective channel. In this paper, we use that\nexpression to analyze the finite-length scaling of these codes on the $q$-ary\nerasure channel with erasure probability $\\epsilon\\in(0,1)$. Our primary result\nis that, for any $\\gamma>0$ and $\\delta>0$, there is a $q_{0}$ such that, for\nall $q\\geq q_{0}$, the fraction of effective channels with erasure rate at most\n$N^{-\\gamma}$ is at least $1-\\epsilon-O(N^{-1/2+\\delta})$, where $N=q^{n}$ is\nthe blocklength. Since this fraction cannot be larger than\n$1-\\epsilon-O(N^{-1/2})$, this establishes near-optimal finite-length scaling\nfor this family of codes. Our approach can be seen as an extension of a similar\nanalysis for binary polar codes by Hassani, Alishahi, and Urbanke.\n  A similar analysis is also considered for $q$-ary polar codes with $m$ by $m$\npolarizing matrices. This separates the effect of the alphabet size from the\neffect of the matrix size. If the polarizing matrix at each stage is drawn\nindependently and uniformly from the set of invertible $m$ by $m$ matrices,\nthen the linear operator associated with the Lyapunov function analysis can be\nwritten in closed form. To prove near-optimal scaling for polar codes with\nfixed $q$ as $m$ increases, however, two technical obstacles remain. Thus, we\nconclude by stating two concrete mathematical conjectures that, if proven,\nwould imply near-optimal scaling for fixed~$q$. \n\n"}

The small-angle capability of the new Super High Momentum Spectrometer\n(SHMS) in Hall C, coupled with its high momentum reach - up to the anticipated\n11-GeV beam energy in Hall C - and coincidence capability with the\nwell-understood High Momentum Spectrometer, will allow for probes of such\nhadron structure involving strangeness down to the smallest distance scales to\ndate. To cleanly select the kaons, a threshold aerogel Cerenkov detector has\nbeen constructed for the SHMS. The detector consists of an aerogel tray\nfollowed by a diffusion box. Four trays for aerogel of nominal refractive\nindices of n=1.030, 1.020, 1.015 and 1.011 were constructed. The tray\ncombination will allow for identification of kaons from 1 GeV/c up to 7.2\nGeV/c, reaching 10^-2 proton and 10^-3 pion rejection, with kaon detection\nefficiency better than 95%. The diffusion box of the detector is equipped with\n14 five-inch diameter photomultiplier tubes. Its interior walls are covered\nwith Gore diffusive reflector, which is superior to the commonly used Millipore\npaper and improved the detector performance by 35%. The inner surface of the\ntwo aerogel trays with higher refractive index is covered with Millipore paper,\nhowever, those two trays with lower aerogel refractive index are again covered\nwith Gore diffusive reflector for higher performance.

Local helioseismology\nreconstructs subsurface structures and flows by extracting coherent signals of\nacoustic waves traveling through the interior and carrying information about\nsubsurface perturbations and flows, from stochastic oscillations observed on\nthe surface. The initial analysis of the subsurface flow maps reconstructed\nfrom the 5 years of SDO/HMI data by time-distance helioseismology reveals the\ngreat potential for studying and understanding of the dynamics of the quiet Sun\nand active regions, and the evolution with the solar cycle. In particular, our\nresults show that the emergence and evolution of active regions are accompanied\nby multi-scale flow patterns, and that the meridional flows display the\nNorth-South asymmetry closely correlating with the magnetic activity. The\nlatitudinal variations of the meridional circulation speed, which are probably\nrelated to the large-scale converging flows, are mostly confined in shallow\nsubsurface layers. Therefore, these variations do not necessarily affect the\nmagnetic flux transport.

In this work, the\ndemonstrator was commissioned and completed, which is discussed extensively.\nThe demonstrator works reliably and collects low-background physics data.

To better understand and possibly discriminate this\nbackground, surface events were studied in detail. This was done mainly using\nlaboratory measurements. For a better interpretation of these measurements,\nsimulations of particle trajectories and ranges were done. The surface\nsensitivity tests showed large differences between the individual detectors.\nOften, a dead-layer was determined, especially at the surfaces where the\nnon-collecting anode (NCA) is the outermost anode rail. Due to this, the\nsensitivity of the surfaces where the collecting anode (CA) is adjacent was\ntypically about a factor of three larger than the NCA sensitivity. A comparison\nof the pulse shape analysis methods LSE and A/E was done. Laboratory\nmeasurements indicate, that the latter performs better.

However, the exact amplification mechanisms of cosmic\nmagnetic fields remain relatively poorly understood.

While dynamo action was previously investigated in great detail for\nincompressible plasmas, I here place particular emphasis on highly compressible\nastrophysical plasmas, which are characterised by strong density fluctuations\nand shocks, such as the interstellar medium.

{"id": "1612.05264", "contents": "Title: The Dynamics of Charged Dust in Magnetized Molecular Clouds Abstract: We study the dynamics of large, charged dust grains in turbulent giant\nmolecular clouds (GMCs). Massive dust grains behave as aerodynamic particles in\nprimarily neutral dense gas, and thus are able to produce dramatic small-scale\nfluctuations in the dust-to-gas ratio. Hopkins & Lee (2016) directly simulated\nthe dynamics of neutral dust grains in super-sonic MHD turbulence, typical of\nGMCs, and showed that the dust-to-gas fluctuations can exceed factor ~1000 on\nsmall scales, with important implications for star formation, stellar\nabundances, and dust behavior and growth. However, even in primarily neutral\ngas in GMCs, dust grains are negatively charged and Lorentz forces are\nnon-negligible. Therefore, we extend our previous study by including the\neffects of Lorentz forces on charged grains (in addition to drag). For small\ncharged grains (sizes <0.1 micron), Lorentz forces suppress dust-to-gas ratio\nfluctuations, while for large grains (sizes >1 micron), Lorentz forces have\nessentially no effect, trends that are well explained with a simple theory of\ndust magnetization. In some special intermediate cases, Lorentz forces can\nenhance dust-gas segregation. Regardless, for the physically expected scaling\nof dust charge with grain size, we find the most important effects depend on\ngrain size (via the drag equation) with Lorentz forces/charge as a second-order\ncorrection. We show that the dynamics we consider are determined by three\ndimensionless numbers in the limit of weak background magnetic fields: the\nturbulent Mach number, a dust drag parameter (proportional to grain size) and a\ndust Lorentz parameter (proportional to grain charge); these allow us to\ngeneralize our simulations to a wide range of conditions. \n\n"}

The\ncurrent explanation for the source of this variation is that inflows into\nactive regions alter the global surface pattern of the meridional circulation.\nWhen these localized inflows are integrated over a full hemisphere, they\ncontribute to the slow down of the axisymmetric poleward horizontal component.\nThe behavior of this large scale flow deep inside the convection zone remains\nlargely unknown. Present helioseismic techniques are not sensitive enough to\ncapture the dynamics of this weak large scale flow. Moreover, the large time of\nintegration needed to map the meridional circulation inside the convection\nzone, also masks some of the possible dynamics on shorter timescales. In this\nwork we examine the dynamics of the meridional circulation that emerges from a\n3D MHD global simulation of the solar convection zone. Our aim is to assess and\nquantify the behavior of meridional circulation deep inside the convection\nzone, where the cyclic large-scale magnetic field can reach considerable\nstrength. Our analyses indicate that the meridional circulation morphology and\namplitude are both highly influenced by the magnetic field, via the impact of\nmagnetic torques on the global angular momentum distribution. A dynamic feature\ninduced by these magnetic torques is the development of a prominent upward flow\nat mid latitudes in the lower convection zone that occurs near the equatorward\nedge of the toroidal bands and that peaks during cycle maximum.

The ratio of Maxwell to Reynolds\nstresses is set by $Rm$. At the onset of instability both stresses have similar\nmagnitude, whereas the Reynolds stress vanishes or becomes even negative as\n$Rm$ increases.

This balance has been studied extensively in the context of gases\nwith constant mean density. However, many astrophysical systems are contracting\nunder the influence of external pressure or gravity, and the balance between\ndriving and dissipation in a contracting, magnetized medium has yet to be\nstudied. In this paper we present three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamic\n(MHD) simulations of compression in a turbulent, magnetized medium that\nresembles the physical conditions inside molecular clouds. We find that in some\ncircumstances the combination of compression and magnetic fields leads to a\nrate of turbulent dissipation far less than that observed in non-magnetized\ngas, or in non-compressing magnetized gas. As a result, a compressing,\nmagnetized gas reaches an equilibrium velocity dispersion much greater than\nwould be expected for either the hydrodynamic or the non-compressing case. We\nuse the simulation results to construct an analytic model that gives an\neffective equation of state for a coarse-grained parcel of the gas, in the form\nof an ideal equation of state with a polytropic index that depends on the\ndissipation and energy transfer rates between the magnetic and turbulent\ncomponents.

It is found\nthat the fluctuation amplitude starts to grow only when the linear growth rate\nis sufficiently large ($\\gamma_{max}\\tau_{A}>O(1)$) to overcome convective\nlosses. The linear growth rate continues to rise until the sizes of plasmoids\nbecome comparable to the inner layer width of the tearing mode. At this point\nthe current sheet is disrupted and the instability enters the early nonlinear\nregime.

BUGS utilises\nthree types of detector to facilitate a high-sensitivity, high-throughput\nradioassay programme to support the development of rare-event search\nexperiments. A Broad Energy Germanium (BEGe) detector delivers sensitivity to\nlow-energy gamma-rays such as those emitted by 210Pb and 234Th.

This paper presents the steps used to\ncharacterise the performance of these detectors for a variety of sample\ngeometries, including the corrections applied to account for cascade summing\neffects. For low-density materials, BUGS is able to radio-assay to specific\nactivities down to 3.6 mBq/kg for 234Th and 6.6 mBq/kg for 210Pb both of which\nhave uncovered some significant equilibrium breaks in the 238U chain.

But the role of magnetic fields and charged dust has not\nyet been studied. We therefore explore the RDI in gas which obeys ideal MHD and\nis coupled to dust via both Lorentz forces and drag, with an external\nacceleration (e.g., gravity, radiation) driving dust drift through gas. We show\nthis is always unstable, at all wavelengths and non-zero values of dust-to-gas\nratio, drift velocity, dust charge, 'stopping time' or drag coefficient (for\nany drag law), or field strength; moreover growth rates depend only weakly\n(sub-linearly) on these parameters. Dust charge and magnetic fields do not\nsuppress instabilities, but give rise to a large number of new instability\n'families,' each with distinct behavior. The 'MHD-wave' (magnetosonic or\nAlfven) RDIs exhibit maximal growth along 'resonant' angles where the modes\nhave a phase velocity matching the corresponding MHD wave, and growth rates\nincrease without limit with wavenumber. The 'gyro' RDIs are driven by\nresonances between drift and Larmor frequencies, giving growth rates sharply\npeaked at specific wavelengths.

It has\nbeen postulated that strong magnetic fields in the cores of some red giants are\nresponsible for their anomalously weak dipole mode amplitudes (the \"dipole\ndichotomy\" problem), but a detailed understanding of how gravity waves interact\nwith strong fields is thus far lacking. In this work, we attack the problem\nthrough a variety of analytical and numerical techniques, applied to a\nlocalised region centred on a null line of a confined axisymmetric magnetic\nfield which is approximated as being cylindrically symmetric. We uncover a rich\nvariety of phenomena that manifest when the field strength exceeds a critical\nvalue, beyond which the symmetry is drastically broken by the Lorentz force.\nWhen this threshold is reached, the spatial structure of the g-modes becomes\nheavily altered. The dynamics of wave packet propagation transitions from\nregular to chaotic, which is expected to fundamentally change the organisation\nof the mode spectrum. In addition, depending on their frequency and the\norientation of field lines with respect to the stratification, waves impinging\non different parts of the magnetised region are found to undergo either\nreflection or trapping.

In the\nidealized setting of a magnetized beta plane, we provide a theoretical\nexplanation that shows how magnetic fluctuations directly counteract the growth\nof weak zonal flows. Two distinct calculations yield consistent conclusions.\nThe first, which is simpler and more physically transparent, extends the\nKelvin-Orr shearing wave to include magnetic fields and shows that weak,\nlong-wavelength shear flow organizes magnetic fluctuations to absorb energy\nfrom the mean flow.

To address this problem we\ninvestigate two closely-related problems, namely: (i) 1D, pinched anti-parallel\nmagnetic fields and (ii) 2D, null point containing fields which are locally\nimbalanced ('null-collapse' or 'X-point collapse').

In a parameter study, we find the scaling with\nresistivity of current sheet properties at the halting time is in good\nagreement - in both geometries - with that inferred from a known 1D similarity\nsolution. We find that the halting of the implosions occurs rapidly after\nreaching the diffusion scale by sudden Ohmic heating of the dense plasma within\nthe current sheet, which provides a pressure gradient sufficient to oppose\nfurther collapse and decelerate the converging flow. This back-pressure grows\nto exceed that required for force balance and so the post-implosion evolution\nis characterised by the consequences of the current sheet `bouncing' outwards.\nThese are: (i) the launching of propagating fast MHD waves (shocks) outwards\nand (ii) the width-wise expansion of the current sheet itself. The expansion is\nonly observed to stall in the 2D case, where the pressurisation is relieved by\noutflow in the reconnection jets. In the 2D case, we quantify the maximum\namount of current sheet expansion as it scales with resistivity, and analyse\nthe structure of the reconnection region which forms post-expansion, replete\nwith Petschek-type slow shocks and fast termination shocks. \n\n"}

In a contrasting, local scenario, the puzzling\nlow-temperature degrees of freedom are, instead, weakly-interacting, strongly\nanharmonic degrees of freedom each of which involves the motion of a few\nhundred particles.

The idea of [CM6] and here is that, by bringing in the\ndynamical properties of the flow, we obtain also smoothing for large time for\ngeneric initial conditions. When combined with [CM1], this shows, in an\nimportant special case, the singularities are the simplest possible.\n  The question of the dynamics of a singularity has two parts. One is: What are\nthe dynamics near a singularity? The second is: What is the long time behavior?\nThat is, if the flow leaves a neighborhood of a singularity, can it return at a\nmuch later time? The first question was addressed in [CM6] and the second here.\n  Combined with [CM1], [CM6], we show that all other closed singularities than\nthe (round) sphere have a neighborhood where `nearly every' closed hypersurface\nleaves under the flow and never returns, even to a dilated, rotated or\ntranslated copy of the singularity. In other words, it wanders off. In\ncontrast, by Huisken, any closed hypersurface near a sphere remains close to a\ndilated or translated copy of the sphere at each time. \n\n"}

In the latter case, neutrons bounce off material surfaces with\nsignificant diffusivity and the population quickly reaches a static spatial\ndistribution with a density gradient induced by the gravitational potential.

Methods: We use simulations of forced turbulence in\nfully periodic cubes composed of isothermal gas with an imposed large-scale\nsinusoidal shear flow. Turbulent viscosity is computed either from the\nresulting Reynolds stress or from the decay rate of the large-scale flow.\nTurbulent magnetic diffusivity is computed using the test-field method. The\nscale dependence of the coefficients is studied by varying the wavenumber of\nthe imposed sinusoidal shear and test fields. Results: We find that turbulent\nviscosity and magnetic diffusivity are in general of the same order of\nmagnitude. Furthermore, the turbulent viscosity depends on the fluid Reynolds\nnumber (${\\rm Re}$) and scale separation ratio of turbulence. The scale\ndependence of the turbulent viscosity is found to be well approximated by a\nLorentzian. The results for the turbulent transport coefficients appear to\nconverge at sufficiently high values of ${\\rm Re}$ and the scale separation\nratio.

We find that all cosmological models fail to match our results if\na constant mass-to-light ratio is assumed. In order for these models to match\nthe faint end of the luminosity function, a mass-to-light ratio decreasing with\nluminosity as $L^{-0.5\\pm 0.06}$ is required.

Earlier estimates, based on the balance\nbetween pressure and gravity, indicated that dark haloes of virial velocity\nlower than Vevap ~ 11-13 km/s have lost most of their gas in a dynamical time.\nWe follow the continuous evaporation by a thermal wind during the period when\nthe ionizing flux was effective. We find that the critical virial velocity for\nsignificant evaporation is significantly higher. For example, if the ionization\nstarts at z-ion=10 and is maintained until z=2, a mass loss of one e-fold\noccurs in haloes of Vevap ~ 25 (or 35 km/s) for T ~ 10^4K (or 2x10^4K).

The UV-bright regions are optically faint and are\ncoincident with HI density enhancements. FUV emission is detected at any\nlocation where the HI surface density exceeds ~2 M_sun pc^{-2}, and is often\ndetected in the absence of visible wavelength emission. UV luminosities of the\nbrighter regions of the tidal tails imply masses of 10^6 M_sun to ~10^9 M_sun\nin young stars in the tails, and HI luminosities imply similar HI masses.\nUV-optical colors of the tidal tails indicate stellar populations as young as a\nfew Myr, and in all cases ages < 400Myr.

This shows that radio and UV\nemission have a common energy source and that the difference between radio loud\nand radio weak is established already on the parsec scale. We investigate the\npossibility that radio jets are responsible for the radio core emission in\nradio loud and radio weak quasars. Comparing our data with a simple jet\nemission model that takes the limits imposed by energy and mass conservation in\na coupled jet-disk system into account, we find that radio loud jets carry a\ntotal power $Q_{\\rm jet}$ that is at least 1/3 of the observed disk luminosity\n$L_{\\rm disk}$. For the electron population one is forced to postulate an\nefficient process producing a large number of pairs and/or injecting electrons\nwith a distribution with low-energy cut-off around 50 MeV -- secondary pair\nproduction in hadronic cascades could be such a process. The bulk Lorentz\nfactor of the jet is limited to a narrow region ($3\\la\\gamma_{\\rm j}\\la10$)).\nThe radio emission of radio weak quasars can be explained with exactly the same\nparameters for a powerful relativistic jet if secondary pair production, as\nsuggested for radio loud jets, is inhibited. There is evidence that RIQ are the\nrelativistically boosted population of radio weak quasar jets. We can estimate\nthe hidden disk luminosity of FR II galaxies and find that this is consistent\nwith FRII being misdirected quasars. \n\n"}

With few\nexceptions, galaxies with M_V < -22 have core profiles, and galaxies with M_V >\n-20.5 have power-law profiles. Both profile types occur in galaxies with -22 <\nM_V < -20.5. We show that these results are consistent with the hypothesis\nthat: (i) all early-type galaxies have black holes (BHs) that grew\nadiabatically in homogeneous isothermal cores; and (ii) these `progenitor'\ncores followed scaling relations similar to those of the fundamental plane.\n  The models studied here are the ones first proposed by Young. Models with BH\nmasses and progenitor cores that obey established scaling relations predict (at\nVirgo) that galaxies with M_V < -21.2 have core profiles and galaxies with M_V\n> -21.2 have power-law profiles. This reproduces both the sense and the\nabsolute magnitude of the observed transition. Intrinsic scatter in BH and\ngalaxy properties can explain why both types of galaxies are observed around\nthe transition magnitude. The observed bimodality in cusp slopes may be due to\na bimodality in M_bh/L, with rapidly rotating disky galaxies having larger\nM_bh/L than slowly rotating boxy galaxies.\n  Application to individual galaxies with HST photometry yields a roughly\nlinear correlation between BH mass and V-band galaxy luminosity, log M_bh =\n-1.83 + log L (solar units). This agrees with the average relation for nearby\ngalaxies with kinematically determined BH masses, and also with predictions\nfrom quasar statistics (shortened abstract). \n\n"}

M.Lyubich and Y.Minsky have\nsuggested to extend Sullivan's dictionary by providing an analogous\nconstruction for iterations of rational functions.

Abstract: The recently discovered sharp peak in the excitation function of the K+/pi+\nratio around 30 A GeV in relativistic heavy-ion collisions is discussed in the\nframework of the Statistical Model. In this model, the freeze-out of an ideal\nhadron gas changes from a situation where baryons dominate to one with mainly\nmesons. This transition occurs at a temperature T = 140 MeV and baryon chemical\npotential mu(B) = 410 MeV corresponding to an energy of sqrt(s) = 8.2 GeV. The\ncalculated maximum in the K+/pi+ ratio is, however, much less pronounced than\nthe one observed by the NA49 Collaboration. The smooth increase of the K-/pi-\nratio with incident energy and the shape of the excitation functions of the\nLambda/pi+, Xi-/pi+ and Omega/pi ratios all exhibiting maxima at different\nincident energies, is consistent with the presently available experimental\ndata. The measured K+/pi+ ratio exceeds the calculated one just at the incident\nenergy when the freeze-out condition is changing.\n  We speculate that at this point freeze-out might occur in a modified way.

Attaining the target sensitivity requires maintaining an electric field\nof several tens of kilovolts per centimeter across the experimental cell, which\nis nominally 7.5 cm wide and will contain about 4 liters of superfluid. The\nelectrical properties of liquid helium are expected to be sufficient to meet\nthe design goals, but little is known about these properties for volumes and\nelectrode spacings appropriate to the EDM experiment. Furthermore, direct\napplication of the necessary voltages from an external source to the\nexperimental test cell is impractical. An apparatus to amplify voltages in the\nliquid helium environment and to test the electrical properties of the liquid\nfor large volumes and electrode spacings has been constructed. The device\nconsists of a large-area parallel plate capacitor immersed in a 200 liter\nliquid helium dewar. Preliminary results show the breakdown strength of normal\nstate liquid helium is at least 90 kV/cm at these volumes, at the helium vapor\npressure corresponding to 4.38 K. These fields hold for more than 11 hours with\nleakage currents less than 170 pA (about 20% of the maximum tolerable in the\nEDM experiment). The system is also found to be robust against anticipated\nradiation backgrounds. Preliminary results for superfluid show that fields of\nat least 30 kV/cm can be sustained at the volumes required for the EDM\nexperiment, about 60% of the design goal. These results are likely limited by\nthe low pressure that must be maintained above the superfluid bath. \n\n"}

Different types of separability may be possible, depending on the\nparticular factorization or split of the Hilbert space. A given orthonormal\nbasis set for a Hilbert space is defined to be of type (p,q) if p elements of\nthe basis are entangled and q are separable, relative to a given bi-partite\nfactorization of that space.

{"id": "quant-ph/0212117", "contents": "Title: On the equivalence of the CH and CHSH inequalities for two three-level\n  systems Abstract: In this paper we show a Clauser-Horne (CH) inequality for two three-level\nquantum systems or qutrits, alternative to the CH inequality given by\nKaszlikowski et al. [PRA 65, 032118 (2002)]. In contrast to this latter CH\ninequality, the new one is shown to be equivalent to the\nClauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality for two qutrits given by Collins\net al. [PRL 88, 040404 (2002)]. Both the CH and CHSH inequalities exhibit the\nstrongest resistance to noise for a nonmaximally entangled state for the case\nof two von Neumann measurements per site, as first shown by Acin et al. [PRA\n65, 052325 (2002)]. This equivalence, however, breaks down when one takes into\naccount the less-than-perfect quantum efficiency of detectors. Indeed, for the\nnoiseless case, the threshold quantum efficiency above which there is no local\nand realistic description of the experiment for the optimal choice of\nmeasurements is found to be 0.814 for the CH inequality, whereas it is equal to\n0.828 for the CHSH inequality. \n\n"}

{"id": "quant-ph/0401071", "contents": "Title: Quantum Computing in Arrays Coupled by 'Always On' Interactions Abstract: It has recently been shown that one can perform quantum computation in a\nHeisenberg chain in which the interactions are 'always on', provided that one\ncan abruptly tune the Zeeman energies of the individual (pseudo-)spins. Here we\nprovide a more complete analysis of this scheme, including several\ngeneralizations. We generalize the interaction to an anisotropic form\n(incorporating the XY, or Forster, interaction as a limit), providing a proof\nthat a chain coupled in this fashion tends to an effective Ising chain in the\nlimit of far off-resonant spins. We derive the primitive two-qubit gate that\nresults from exploiting abrupt Zeeman tuning with such an interaction. We also\ndemonstrate, via numerical simulation, that the same basic scheme functions in\nthe case of smoothly shifted Zeeman energies. We conclude with some remarks\nregarding generalisations to two- and three-dimensional arrays. \n\n"}

These\ninequalities involve applying displacement operations to half of the ions and\nthen measuring correlations between pairs of corresponding bits in the binary\nrepresentations of the number of centre-of-mass phonons of N particular ions.\nIt is shown that the state violates the inequalities and thus displays\nnonclassical correlations. It is also demonstrated that it violates a Bell\ninequality when the displacements are replaced by squeezing operations. \n\n"}

{"id": "quant-ph/9803007", "contents": "Title: Efficient Quantum Key Distribution Abstract: We devise a simple modification that essentially doubles the efficiency of a\nwell-known quantum key distribution scheme proposed by Bennett and Brassard\n(BB84). Our scheme assigns significantly different probabilities for the\ndifferent polarization bases during both transmission and reception to reduce\nthe fraction of discarded data. The actual probabilities used in the scheme are\nannounced in public. As the number of transmitted signals increases, the\nefficiency of our scheme can be made to approach 100%. An eavesdropper may try\nto break such a scheme by eavesdropping mainly along the predominant basis. To\ndefeat such an attack, we perform a refined analysis of accepted data: Instead\nof lumping all the accepted data together to estimate a single error rate, we\nseparate the accepted data into various subsets according to the basis employed\nand estimate an error rate for each subset {\\it individually}. \n\n"}

The\nstability of correlations between the einselected quantum pointer states and\nthe environment allows them to exist almost as objectively as classical states\nwere once thought to exist: There are ways of finding out what is the pointer\nstate of the system which utilize redundancy of their correlations with the\nenvironment, and which leave einselected states essentially unperturbed. This\nrelatively objective existence of certain quantum states facilitates\noperational definition of probabilities in the quantum setting. Moreover, once\nthere are states that `exist' and can be `found out', a `collapse' in the\ntraditional sense is no longer necessary --- in effect, it has already\nhappened. The records of the observer will contain evidence of an effective\ncollapse. The role of the preferred states in the processing and storage of\ninformation is emphasized. The existential interpretation based on the\nrelatively objective existence of stable correlations between the einselected\nstates of observers memory and in the outside Universe is formulated and\ndiscussed. \n\n"}
