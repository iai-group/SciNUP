Aligning high-resolution Hubble\nSpace Telescope (HST) observations of the supernova itself with the archival\nCFHT images allowed us to pinpoint the location of the progenitor site on the\nground based observations.

The galaxy is known to possess a dramatic 70 kpc\nX-ray tail. The detected H-alpha tail coincides positionally with the X-ray\ntail. The H-alpha emission in the galaxy is sharply truncated on the front and\nthe sides near the nucleus, indicating significant ram pressure stripping. ESO\n137-001 is thus the first cluster late-type galaxy known unambiguously with\nboth an X-ray tail and an H-alpha tail. The emission-line objects are all\ndistributed downstream of the galaxy, with projected distance up to 39 kpc from\nthe galaxy. From the analysis on the H-alpha_{off} frame and the estimate of\nthe background emission-line objects, we conclude that it is very likely all 29\nemission-line objects are HII regions in A3627. The high surface number density\nand luminosities of these HII regions (up to 10^40 ergs/s) dwarf the previously\nknown examples of isolated HII regions in clusters.

The total mass of formed stars in the stripped ISM of ESO\n137-001 may approach several times 10^7 solar masses.

For spin-independent (SI) interactions, the best fit\nDAMA regions are ruled out to the 3$\\sigma$ C.L., even with channeling taken\ninto account. However, for WIMP masses of ~8 GeV some parameters outside these\nregions still yield a moderately reasonable fit to the DAMA data and are\ncompatible with all 90% C.L. upper limits from negative searches, when\nchanneling is included.

A thorough understanding of loss-cone refilling mechanisms is\nimportant for the prediction of astrophysical quantities, such as rates of\ntidal disrupting main-sequence stars, rates of capturing compact stellar\nremnants and timescales of merging binary MBHs. In this thesis, we use N-body\nsimulations to investigate how noise from accreted satellites and other\nsubstructures in a galaxy's halo can affect the LC refilling rate.\n  Any N-body model suffers from Poisson noise which is similar to, but much\nstronger than, the two-body diffusion occurring in real galaxies.

If we assume these cross sections are zero, then the standard\nsolar model including neutrino oscillations predicts a total capture rate in Ga\nin the range of 63-66 SNU with an uncertainty of about 4%, in good agreement\nwith experiment. We derive the current value of the neutrino flux produced in\nthe Sun by the proton-proton fusion reaction to be (6.0 +/- 0.8) x\n10^(10)/(cm^2 s), which agrees well with the pp flux predicted by the standard\nsolar model. Finally, we show that the data are consistent with the assumption\nthat the solar neutrino production rate is constant in time. \n\n"}

Such a framework, where DM recoils against electrons bound\nin atoms, has been proposed as an explanation for the annually modulated\nscintillation signal in DAMA/LIBRA versus the absence of a signal for nuclear\nrecoils in experiments like CDMS or XENON10. However, even in such a\nleptophilic DM scenario there are loop induced DM-hadron interactions, where\nthe photons emitted from virtual leptons couple to the charge of a nucleus.\nUsing a general effective field theory approach we show that, if such an\ninteraction is induced at one or two-loop level, then DM-nucleus scattering\ndominates over DM-electron scattering. This is because the latter is suppressed\nby the bound state wave function. One obtains a situation similar to standard\nDM-nucleus scattering analyses with considerable tension between the results of\nDAMA and CDMS/XENON10. This conclusion does not apply in the case of\npseudoscalar or axial vector coupling between DM and leptons, where the loop\ndiagrams vanish. In this case the explanation of the DAMA signal in terms of\nDM-electron scattering is strongly disfavored by the spectral shape of the\nsignal. Furthermore, if DM can annihilate into neutrinos or tau leptons, the\nrequired cross sections are excluded by many orders of magnitude using the\nSuper-Kamiokande bound on neutrinos from DM annihilations in the Sun. \n\n"}

We find that dust sputtering and especially dust-gas friction would\nimply relatively short timescales (t ~ 10^4 years) for dust survival in the\nwind-shocked region of the bubble. To explain the 24 micron emission, we\npostulate that the grains are replenished within the wind-blown bubble by\ndestruction of embedded, dense cloudlets of ISM gas that have been over-run by\nthe expanding wind-blown bubble. We calculate the ablation timescales for\ncloudlets within N49 and find approximate parameters for the embedded cloudlets\nthat can replenish the dust; the parameters for the cloudlets are roughly\nsimilar to those observed in other nebula. Such dust will have an important\neffect on the bubble: including simple dust cooling in a wind-blown bubble\nmodel for N49, we find that the luminosity is higher by approximately a factor\nof six at a bubble age of about 10^4 years. At ages of 10^7 years, the energy\ncontained in the bubble is lower by about a factor of eight if dust is\nincluded; if dust must be replenished within the bubble, the associated\naccompanying gas mass will also be very important to wind-blown bubble cooling\nand evolution. While more detailed models are certainly called for, this work\nillustrates the possible strong importance of dust in wind-blown bubbles, and\nis a first step toward models of dusty, wind-blown bubbles. \n\n"}

Abstract: This review addresses the issue of whether there are physically realistic\nself-similar solutions in which a primordial black hole is attached to an exact\nor asymptotically Friedmann model for an equation of state of the form\n$p=(\\gamma-1)\\rho c^2$. In the positive pressure case ($1 < \\gamma < 2$), there\nis no such solution when the black hole is attached to an exact Friedmann\nbackground via a sonic point. However, it has been claimed that there is a\none-parameter family of asymptotically Friedmann black hole solutions providing\nthe ratio of the black hole size to the cosmological horizon size is in a\nnarrow range above some critical value. There are also \"universal\" black holes\nin which the black hole has an apparent horizon but no event horizon. It turns\nout that both these types of solution are only asymptotically {\\it\nquasi}-Friedmann, because they contain a solid angle deficit at large\ndistances, but they are not necessarily excluded observationally.\n  We also consider the possibility of self-similar black hole solutions in a\nuniverse dominated by a scalar field. If the field is massless, the situation\nresembles the stiff fluid case, so any black hole solution is again contrived,\nalthough there may still be universal black hole solutions. The situation is\nless clear if the scalar field is rolling down a potential and therefore\nmassive, as in the quintessence scenario. Although no explicit asymptotically\nFriedmann black hole solutions of this kind are known, they are not excluded\nand comparison with the $0 < \\gamma < 2/3$ perfect fluid case suggests that\nthey should exist if the black hole is not too large. This implies that a black\nhole might grow as fast as the cosmological horizon in a quintessence-dominated\nuniverse in some circumstances, supporting the proposal that accretion onto\nprimordial black holes may have played a role in the production of the\nsupermassive black holes in galactic nuclei. \n\n"}

Using a\nsimulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy, we determine the data-quality required\nto detect the dark matter density at its expected local value. We introduce a\nnew method for recovering rho_dm that uses moments of the Jeans equations,\ncombined with a Monte Carlo Markov Chain technique to marginalise over the\nunknown parameters. Given sufficiently good data, we show that our method can\nrecover the correct local dark matter density even in the face of disc\ninhomogeneities, non-isothermal tracers and a non-separable distribution\nfunction. We illustrate the power of our technique by applying it to Hipparcos\ndata [Holmberg & Flynn 2000,2004]. We first make the assumption that the A and\nF star tracer populations are isothermal. This recovers\nrho_dm=0.003^{+0.009}_{-0.007}Msun/pc^3 (with 90 per cent confidence),\nconsistent with previous determinations. However, the vertical dispersion\nprofile of these tracers is poorly known. If we assume instead a non-isothermal\nprofile similar to the blue disc stars from SDSS DR-7 [Abazajian et al. 2009]\nmeasured by Bond et al. (2009), we obtain a fit with a very similar chi^2\nvalue, but with rho_dm=0.033^{+0.008}_{-0.009}Msun/pc^3 (with 90 per cent\nconfidence). This highlights that it is vital to measure the vertical\ndispersion profile of the tracers to recover an unbiased estimate of the local\ndark matter density. \n\n"}

However, baryonic physics\nmay affect the dark matter density profile. For example, it was suggested that\nadiabatic contraction of baryonic gas makes the dark matter cusp steeper.\nHowever, it is still an open question if the gas falls into the galactic centre\nin smooth adiabatic manner. Recent numerical studies suggested that disc\ngalaxies might experience clumpy phase in their early stage of the disc\nformation, which could also explain clump clusters and chain galaxies observed\nin high redshift Universe. In this letter, using numerical simulations with an\nisolated model, we study how the dark matter halo responds to these clumpy\nnature of baryon component in disc galaxy formation through the clump cluster\nphase. Our simulation demonstrates that such clumpy phase leads to a shallower\ndensity profile of the dark matter halo in the central region while clumps fall\ninto the centre due to dynamical friction. This mechanism helps to make the\ncentral dark matter density profile shallower in the galaxies whose virial mass\nis as large as 5.0*10^11 solar masses. This phenomenon is caused by reaction to\ndynamical friction of the stellar clumps against the dark matter halo. The halo\ndraws the clumps into the galactic centre, while kinematically heated by the\nclumps.

In addition, the VISIR\ndata are compared with lower spatial resolution data from Spitzer/IRS and IRAS.\nBy using a scaled starburst template SED and the PAH 11.3 \\mum emission line\nthe maximum nuclear star formation contamination to the VISIR photometry is\nrestricted to < 30% for 75% of the LLAGN.

We take\nparticular care understanding the different physical effects and scales that\ncome into play. We then forecast how the string axiverse may be constrained and\nshow that with a combination of different observations, it should be possible\nto detect a fraction of ultralight axions to dark matter of a few percent. \n\n"}

There is a fair\namount of evidence that galaxy properties depend on mass of groups and\nclusters, in the sense that quiescent galaxies prefer more massive systems. We\nbase our analysis on a mass-selected environment using X-ray groups of galaxies\nand define the group membership using a large number of spectroscopic redshifts\nfrom zCOSMOS. We show that the fraction of red galaxies is higher in groups\nthan in the field at all redshifts probed in our study. Interestingly, the\nfraction of [OII] emitters on the red sequence increases at higher redshifts in\ngroups, while the fraction does not strongly evolve in the field. This is due\nto increased dusty star formation activities and/or increased activities of\nactive galactic nuclei (AGNs) in high redshift groups. We study these\npossibilities using the 30-band photometry and X-ray data. We find that the\nstellar population of the red [OII] emitters in groups is old and there is no\nclear hint of dusty star formation activities in those galaxies. The observed\nincrease of red [OII] emitters in groups is likely due to increased AGN\nactivities.

In\nthe case of low-background physics, however, a primary concern is the effect on\nthe detector from radioactivity inherent in the detector parts themselves. From\nthis standpoint, there is no single source or beam, but rather a collection of\nsources with potentially complicated spatial extent. LUXSim is a simulation\nframework used by the LUX collaboration that takes a component-centric approach\nto event generation and recording. A new set of classes allows for multiple\nradioactive sources to be set within any number of components at run time, with\nthe entire collection of sources handled within a single simulation run.\nVarious levels of information can also be recorded from the individual\ncomponents, with these record levels also being set at runtime.

For this purpose we calculate in detail the gravitino\ndecay widths in theories with bilinear violation of R parity, particularly\nfocusing on decay channels with three particles in the final state. Based on\nthese calculations we predict the fluxes of gamma rays, charged cosmic rays and\nneutrinos expected from decays of gravitino dark matter. Although the predicted\nspectra could in principal explain the anomalies observed in the cosmic-ray\npositron and electron fluxes as measured by PAMELA and Fermi LAT, we find that\nthis possibility is ruled out by strong constraints from gamma-ray and\nantiproton observations.\n  Therefore, we employ current data of indirect detection experiments to place\nstrong constraints on the gravitino lifetime and the strength of R-parity\nviolation.

These simulations include\nexplicit H2 and metal cooling, star formation (SF) and supernovae (SNe) driven\ngas outflows. Starting at high redshift, rapid, repeated gas outflows following\nbursty SF transfer energy to the DM component and significantly flatten the\noriginally `cuspy' central DM mass profile of galaxies with present day stellar\nmasses in the 10^4.5 -- 10^9.8 Msolar range. At z=0, the central slope of the\nDM density profile of our galaxies (measured between 0.3 and 0.7 kpc from their\ncentre) is well fitted by rhoDM propto r^alpha with alpha \\simeq -0.5 + 0.35\nlog_10(Mstar/10^8Msolar) where Mstar is the stellar mass of the galaxy and 4 <\nlog_10 Mstar < 9.4.

In this work, we use VLBI data of the radio-jet in the quasar S5\n0836+710 and hypothesize that the ridge-line of helical jets like this\ncorresponds to a pressure maximum in the jet and assume that the helically\ntwisted pressure maximum is the result of a helical wave pattern.

The results show that the structures observed are physical and not\ngenerated artificially by the observing arrays.

Anisotropic heat conduction allows convective\ninstabilities to be driven by temperature gradients of either sign, the\nmagnetothermal instability (MTI) in the outskirts of non-isothermal clusters\nand the heat-flux buoyancy-driven instability (HBI) in their cooling cores. We\nemploy the Athena MHD code to investigate the nonlinear evolution of these\ninstabilities, self-consistently including the effects of anisotropic viscosity\n(i.e. Braginskii pressure anisotropy), anisotropic conduction, and radiative\ncooling. We highlight the importance of the microscale instabilities that\ninevitably accompany and regulate the pressure anisotropies generated by the\nHBI and MTI. We find that, in all but the innermost regions of cool-core\nclusters, anisotropic viscosity significantly impairs the ability of the HBI to\nreorient magnetic-field lines orthogonal to the temperature gradient. Thus,\nwhile radio-mode feedback appears necessary in the central few tens of kpc,\nconduction may be capable of offsetting radiative losses throughout most of a\ncool core over a significant fraction of the Hubble time. Magnetically-aligned\ncold filaments are then able to form by local thermal instability. Viscous\ndissipation during the formation of a cold filament produces accompanying hot\nfilaments, which can be searched for in deep Chandra observations of nearby\ncool-core clusters. In the case of the MTI, anisotropic viscosity maintains the\ncoherence of magnetic-field lines over larger distances than in the inviscid\ncase, providing a natural lower limit for the scale on which the field can\nfluctuate freely.

{"id": "1205.0253", "contents": "Title: The Radius of Baryonic Collapse in Disc Galaxy Formation Abstract: In the standard picture of disc galaxy formation, baryons and dark matter\nreceive the same tidal torques, and therefore approximately the same initial\nspecific angular momentum. However, observations indicate that disc galaxies\ntypically have only about half as much specific angular momentum as their dark\nmatter haloes. We argue this does not necessarily imply that baryons lose this\nmuch specific angular momentum as they form galaxies. It may instead indicate\nthat galaxies are most directly related to the inner regions of their host\nhaloes, as may be expected in a scenario where baryons in the inner parts of\nhaloes collapse first. A limiting case is examined under the idealised\nassumption of perfect angular momentum conservation. Namely, we determine the\ndensity contrast Delta, with respect to the critical density of the Universe,\nby which dark matter haloes need to be defined in order to have the same\naverage specific angular momentum as the galaxies they host. Under the\nassumption that galaxies are related to haloes via their characteristic\nrotation velocities, the necessary Delta is ~600. This Delta corresponds to an\naverage halo radius and mass which are ~60% and ~75%, respectively, of the\nvirial values (i.e., for Delta = 200). We refer to this radius as the radius of\nbaryonic collapse R_BC, since if specific angular momentum is conserved\nperfectly, baryons would come from within it. It is not likely a simple step\nfunction due to the complex gastrophysics involved, therefore we regard it as\nan effective radius. In summary, the difference between the predicted initial\nand the observed final specific angular momentum of galaxies, which is\nconventionally attributed solely to angular momentum loss, can more naturally\nbe explained by a preference for collapse of baryons within R_BC, with possibly\nsome later angular momentum transfer. \n\n"}

One\ndifficulty, however, is that with the short exposure time ($\\simeq$15 seconds)\nproposed, the spatial variation of the Point Spread Function (PSF) shapes may\nbe dominated by the atmosphere, in addition to optics errors. While optics\nerrors mainly cause the PSF to vary on angular scales similar or larger than a\nsingle CCD sensor, the atmosphere generates stochastic structures on a wide\nrange of angular scales. It thus becomes a challenge to infer the multi-scale,\ncomplex atmospheric PSF patterns by interpolating the sparsely sampled stars in\nthe field. In this paper we present a new method, PSFent, for interpolating the\nPSF shape parameters, based on reconstructing underlying shape parameter maps\nwith a multi-scale maximum entropy algorithm. We demonstrate, using images from\nthe LSST Photon Simulator, the performance of our approach relative to a\n5th-order polynomial fit (representing the current standard) and a simple\nboxcar smoothing technique. Quantitatively, PSFent predicts more accurate PSF\nmodels in all scenarios and the residual PSF errors are spatially less\ncorrelated. This improvement in PSF interpolation leads to a factor of 3.5\nlower systematic errors in the shear power spectrum on scales smaller than\n$\\sim13'$, compared to polynomial fitting.

Some\nprevious works have had sufficient statistical precision, but lacked robust\nverification of absolute accuracy. Convergence tests of the mass function with,\nfor example, simulation start redshift can exhibit false convergence of the\nmass function due to counteracting errors, potentially misleading one to infer\noverly optimistic estimations of simulation accuracy. Percent level accuracy is\npossible if initial condition particle mapping uses second order Lagrangian\nPerturbation Theory, and if the start epoch is between 10 and 50 expansion\nfactors before the epoch of halo formation of interest. The mass function for\nhalos with fewer than ~1000 particles is highly sensitive to simulation\nparameters and start redshift, implying a practical minimum mass resolution\nlimit due to mass discreteness.

Motivated by the observational\nsample, this paper considers possible effects from collisions of smaller rocky\nplanets with gas giant planets. In this scenario, the Jovian planets migrate\nfirst and enter into (approximately) 4 day orbits, whereas rocky planets (mass\n= 0.1-20 that of Earth) migrate later and then encounter the gaseous giants.\nPrevious work indicates that the collision rates are high for such systems.\nThis paper calculates the trajectories of incoming rocky planets as they orbit\nwithin the gaseous planets and are subjected to gravitational, frictional, and\ntidal forces. These collisions always increase the metallicity of the Jovian\nplanets. If the incoming rocky bodies survive tidal destruction and reach the\ncentral regions, they provide a means of producing large planetary cores.

The energy resolution for single hadrons is\ndetermined to be approximately 58%/sqrt(E/GeV}. This resolution is improved to\napproximately 45%/sqrt(E/GeV) with software compensation techniques. These\ntechniques take advantage of the event-by-event information about the\nsubstructure of hadronic showers which is provided by the imaging capabilities\nof the calorimeter. The energy reconstruction is improved either with\ncorrections based on the local energy density or by applying a single\ncorrection factor to the event energy sum derived from a global measure of the\nshower energy density. The application of the compensation algorithms to Geant4\nsimulations yield resolution improvements comparable to those observed for real\ndata. \n\n"}

The excellent\nenergy resolution of the HPGe detector allows the selection of events with\nCompton electrons of known energy in the LXe detector. We find that the\nscintillation yield initially increases as the electron energy decreases from\n120 keV to about 60keV but then decreases by about 30% from 60keV to 2keV.

Our\nerrors are within 6-percent (XO-1) and 26-percent (HD209458b) of the\nphoton-limit at a spectral resolving power of 70, and are better than\n0.01-percent per spectral channel.

We decomposed the PSF ellipticities into three\ncomponents, the optical aberration, atmospheric turbulence, and\nchip-misalignment in an empirical manner, and evaluated the amplitude of each\ncomponent. We found that, for long-exposure data, the optical aberration has\nthe largest contribution to the PSF ellipticities, which could be modeled well\nby a simple analytic function based on the lowest-order aberration theory. The\nstatistical properties of PSF ellipticities resulting from the atmospheric\nturbulence were investigated by using the numerical simulations. The simulation\nresults are in a reasonable agreement with the observed data. It is also found\nthat the optical PSF can be well corrected by the standard correction method\nwith a polynomial fitting function.

Not All Approaches to\n  Large-Scale Structure Are Created Equal Abstract: We present a pedagogical systematic investigation of the accuracy of Eulerian\nand Lagrangian perturbation theories of large-scale structure. We show that\nsignificant differences exist between them especially when trying to model the\nBaryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). We find that the best available model of\nthe BAO in real space is the Zel'dovich Approximation (ZA), giving an accuracy\nof <~3% at redshift of z=0 in modelling the matter 2-pt function around the\nacoustic peak. All corrections to the ZA around the BAO scale are perfectly\nperturbative in real space. Any attempt to achieve better precision requires\ncalibrating the theory to simulations because of the need to renormalize those\ncorrections. In contrast, theories which do not fully preserve the ZA as their\nsolution, receive O(1) corrections around the acoustic peak in real space at\nz=0, and are thus of suspicious convergence at low redshift around the BAO. As\nan example, we find that a similar accuracy of 3% for the acoustic peak is\nachieved by Eulerian Standard Perturbation Theory (SPT) at linear order only at\nz~4. Thus even when SPT is perturbative, one needs to include loop corrections\nfor z<~4 in real space. In Fourier space, all models perform similarly, and are\ncontrolled by the overdensity amplitude, thus recovering standard results.\nHowever, that comes at a price. Real space cleanly separates the BAO signal\nfrom non-linear dynamics. In contrast, Fourier space mixes signal from short\nmildly non-linear scales with the linear signal from the BAO to the level that\nnon-linear contributions from short scales dominate. Therefore, one has little\nhope in constructing a systematic theory for the BAO in Fourier space. \n\n"}

In local regions near the\nheater the results are well described with the 1D code. The heater's region\nprojects onto the stellar surface forming a hot spot. There are two heat\npropagation regimes. In the first, conduction outflow regime (realized at heat\nrates $H_0 \\lesssim 10^{20}$ erg cm$^{-3}$ s$^{-1}$ or temperatures\n$T_\\mathrm{h} \\lesssim 10^9$ K in the heater) the thermal surface emission of\nthe star depends on the heater's power and neutrino emission in the stellar\ncore.

In addition, the surveys also probe primordial\nperturbations and carry out fundamental measurements, such as determining the\nsum of neutrino masses. Large-scale simulations of structure formation in the\nUniverse play a critical role in the interpretation of the data and extraction\nof the physics of interest.

We consider a singlet fermion WIMP and effective\noperators up to dimension 6 which are generated at the mass scale of particles\nmediating DM interactions with the SM. We perform a one-loop Renormalization\nGroup Evolution (RGE) analysis, evolving these effective operators from the\nmediators mass scale to the nuclear scales probed by direct searches.

A primary goal for identifying these rare galaxies is to\nexamine whether the fundamental metallicity relation (FMR) between stellar\nmass, gas metallicity, and star formation rate (SFR) holds for low stellar mass\nand high SFR galaxies. The FMR suggests that higher SFR galaxies have lower\nmetallicity (at fixed stellar mass). To test this trend, we combine\nspectroscopic measurements of metallicity and dust-corrected SFRs, with stellar\nmass estimates from modeling the optical photometry. We find that these\ngalaxies are $1.05\\pm0.61$ dex above the z~1 stellar mass-SFR relation, and\n$0.23\\pm0.23$ dex below the local mass-metallicity relation. Relative to the\nFMR, the latter offset is reduced to 0.01 dex, but significant dispersion\nremains (0.29 dex with 0.16 dex due to measurement uncertainties). This\ndispersion suggests that gas accretion, star formation and chemical enrichment\nhave not reached equilibrium in these galaxies.

The\nsub-percent to few percent accuracy of those measurements is unprecedented.

The richest\nsystems in the nearby universe, the Sloan Great Wall, the Corona Borealis\nsupercluster and the Ursa Major supercluster are among them. The probability\nthat we obtain maxima like this from random distributions is lower than 0.001.\nOur results confirm that shell-like structures can be found in the distribution\nof nearby galaxies and their systems. The radii of the possible shells are\nlarger than expected for a BAO shell (approximately 109 Mpc/h versus\napproximately 120 Mpc/h), and they are determined by very rich galaxy clusters\nand superclusters with high density contrast while BAO shells are barely seen\nin the galaxy distribution.

We present a study\nof 191 broad-line quasars and their host galaxies at z < 1, using high\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) spectra produced by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\nReverberation Mapping project. Clear detection of stellar absorption lines\nallows a reliable decomposition of the observed spectra into nuclear and host\ncomponents, using spectral models of quasar and stellar radiations as well as\nemission lines from the interstellar medium. We estimate age, mass (M*), and\nvelocity dispersion (sigma*) of the host stars, the star formation rate (SFR),\nquasar luminosity, and SMBH mass (Mbh), for each object. The quasars are\npreferentially hosted by massive galaxies with M* ~ 10^{11} Msun characterized\nby stellar ages around a billion years, which coincides with the transition\nphase of normal galaxies from the blue cloud to the red sequence. The host\ngalaxies have relatively low SFRs and fall below the main sequence of\nstar-forming galaxies at similar redshifts. These facts suggest that the hosts\nhave experienced an episode of major star formation sometime in the past\nbillion years, which was subsequently quenched or suppressed. The derived Mbh -\nsigma* and Mbh - M* relations agree with our past measurements and are\nconsistent with no evolution from the local Universe.

Assuming a simple Type-II seesaw mechanism for neutrino\nmasses, we show that for the right-handed (RH) gauge boson mass and coupling\nvalues required to explain the LHC anomalies, the RH contribution to the lepton\nnumber violating process of neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\\nu\\beta\\beta$)\nis already constrained by current experiments for relatively low-mass (MeV-GeV)\nRH neutrinos.

Since filaments are tracers of medium-to-high density\nregions, we expect that galaxy properties associated with the environment are\ndependent on the distance to the nearest filament. Our analysis demonstrates\nthat a red galaxy or a high-mass galaxy tend to reside closer to filaments than\na blue or low-mass galaxy. After adjusting the effect from stellar mass, on\naverage, early-forming galaxies or large galaxies have a shorter distance to\nfilaments than late-forming galaxies or small galaxies. For the Main galaxy\nsample (MGS), all signals are very significant ($>6\\sigma$). For the LOWZ and\nCMASS sample, the stellar mass and size are significant ($>2 \\sigma$). The\nfilament effects we observe persist until $z = 0.7$ (the edge of the CMASS\nsample).

The sample was initially selected from 1.65 deg^2 of ground-based imaging in\nthe UltraVISTA/COSMOS and UDS/SXDS fields, and includes the extreme Lyman-alpha\nemitters, `Himiko' and `CR7'. A deconfusion analysis of the deep Spitzer\nphotometry available suggests that these galaxies exhibit strong rest-frame\noptical nebular emission lines (EW_0(H_beta + [OIII]) > 600A). We find that\nirregular, multiple-component morphologies suggestive of clumpy or merging\nsystems are common (f_multi > 0.4) in bright z ~ 7 galaxies, and ubiquitous at\nthe very bright end (M_UV < -22.5). The galaxies have half-light radii in the\nrange r_1/2 ~ 0.5-3 kpc. The size measurements provide the first determination\nof the size-luminosity relation at z ~ 7 that extends to M_UV ~ -23. We find\nthe relation to be steep with r_1/2 ~ L^1/2. Excluding clumpy, multi-component\ngalaxies however, we find a shallower relation that implies an increased\nstar-formation rate surface density in bright LBGs. Using the new, independent,\nHST/WFC3 data we confirm that the rest-frame UV luminosity function at z ~ 7\nfavours a power-law decline at the bright-end, compared to an exponential\nSchechter function drop-off. Finally, these results have important implications\nfor the Euclid mission, which we predict will detect > 1000 similarly bright\ngalaxies at z ~ 7.

For young pulsars the\nlong-term trends are generally obscured by short term phenomena such as timing\nnoise and the recoveries form large glitches. Here we present a new method to\novercome the latter and report on braking index measurements for the Vela-like\npulsars PSR B1800-21 and PSR B1823-13, an updated measurement for Vela and new\nestimates for four more glitching pulsars observed at Jodrell Bank Observatory.\nThe values of braking indices describe the long-term evolution of the pulsars\nacross the P-P' diagram. Despite some measurements being affected by\nconsiderable uncertainties, there is evidence for a common trend involving low\nbraking indices (n<=2) among young glitching pulsars. Such values introduce a\nnew variant in the evolution of young pulsars and their relationship with other\npopulations in the P-P' diagram. Low braking indices also imply that these\npulsars could be a few times older than their characteristic ages. We consider\nPSR B1757-24 and conclude that the pulsar could be old enough to be related to\nthe supernova remnant G5.4-1.2. Between glitches, the short-term evolution of\nVela-like pulsars is characterised by large inter-glitch braking indices n_ig >\n10. We interpret both short and long term trends as signatures of the large\nglitch activity, and speculate that they are driven by short-term post-glitch\nre-coupling and a cumulative long-term decoupling of superfluid to the rotation\nof the star. \n\n"}

It can take several hours\nfor a detector to stabilize enough to return to its nominal state for\nscientific observations.

Such studies in high-resolution (in the order\nof 0.1\") are highly desirable yet very rare so far. In this work, we present a\ndetailed observation of a pre-eruption evolution of a filament obtained by the\n1.6 m New Solar Telescope (NST) at Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO). One end\nof the filament is anchored at the sunspot in NOAA active region (AR) 11515,\nwhich is well observed by NST H$\\alpha$ off-bands four hours before till one\nhour after the filament eruption. A M1.6 flare is associated with the eruption.\nWe observed persistent downflowing materials along the H$\\alpha$ multi-threaded\ncomponent of the loop towards the AR end during the pre-eruption phase. We\ntraced the trajectories of plasma blobs along the H$\\alpha$ threads and\nobtained the plane-of-sky velocity of 45 km s$^{-1}$ on average. We further\nestimated the real velocities of the downflows and the altitude of the filament\nby matching the observed H$\\alpha$ threads with magnetic field lines\nextrapolated from a nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) model.

UDP as such is unreliable and packet\nlosses can occur. The achievable data rates can suffer if optimal packet sizes\nare not used. The alternative, Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) guarantees\nthe ordered delivery of data and automatically adjusts transmission to match\nthe capability of the transmission link. Nevertheless UDP is often favored over\nTCP due to its simplicity, small memory and instruction footprints. Both UDP\nand TCP are implemented in all larger operating systems and commercial embedded\nframeworks. In addition UDP also supported on a variety of small hardware\nplatforms such as Digital Signal Processors (DSP) Field Programmable Gate\nArrays (FPGA). This is not so common for TCP. This paper describes how high\nspeed UDP based data transmission with very low packet error ratios was\nachieved. The near-reliable communications link is used in a data acquisition\n(DAQ) system for the next generation of extremely intense neutron source,\nEuropean Spallation Source.

In the framework of\npoint-like analysis, dwarf spheroidal(dSph) galaxies are usually considered as\none of the best category of targets for indirect DM searches. Nonetheless, as a\nresult of their uncertain kinematics, the DM content and astrophysical\nJ-factors of dSphs are usually affected by significant errors. In this paper,\nwe study a sample of 36 dIrrs as prospective targets of interest. In the\nframework of the universal rotation curve, the kinematics of dIrr galaxies\nprovides a good estimation of their DM halo density distribution and,\nconsequently, of their astrophysical J-factors. We calculate the J-factors for\nthese 36 dIrr galaxies. We find a range of values comparable with the J-factors\nof dSph galaxies. However, differently from dSphs an extra astrophysical\ngamma-ray background component is expected in dIrrs, that is due to their\nstar-formation activity. In this paper, we show via a theoretical approach that\nfor galaxies in our sample the extra astrophysical background component is\nnegligible. Therefore, we conclude that dIrr galaxies can be potentially\nconsidered as additional point-like targets for DM searches with gamma-rays.

In the most massive\ngalaxy clusters, the relation is determined primarily by cosmological structure\nformation.

Besides using the angular momentum of the 15 solar-mass model\nas obtained in the stellar evolution calculation with an angular frequency of\nabout 0.001 rad/s (spin period of more than 6000 s) at the Si/Si-O interface,\nwe also computed 2D and 3D cases with no rotation and with a ~300 times shorter\nrotation period and different angular resolutions. In 2D, only the nonrotating\nand slowly rotating models explode, while rapid rotation prevents an explosion\nwithin 500 ms after bounce because of lower radiated neutrino luminosities and\nmean energies and thus reduced neutrino heating. In contrast, only the fast\nrotating model develops an explosion in 3D when the Si/Si-O interface collapses\nthrough the shock.

How many quasinormal modes are\nnecessary to describe waveforms with a prescribed precision? What error do we\nincur by only including quasinormal modes, and not tails?

Here we present a MicroMegas\nbased structure which achieves the required time precision (ie 24 picoseconds\nfor 150 GeV $\\mu$'s) and could potentially offer an inexpensive solution\ncovering large areas with $\\sim 1$ cm$^2$ pixel size. We present here a\nproof-of-principle which motivates further work in our group toward realizing a\npractical design capable of long-term survival in a high rate experiment. \n\n"}

Unexpected discoveries, such as the\ndiphoton excess F(750 GeV) seen at the LHC, could strongly motivate the\nconstruction of a photon collider. In order to enable the gamma-gamma collision\noption, the ILC design should be compatible with it from the very beginning. In\nthis paper, we discuss the problem of the beam crossing angle. In the ILC\ntechnical design, this angle is 14 mrad, which is just enough to provide enough\nspace for the final quadrupoles and outgoing beams. For gamma-gamma collisions,\nthe crossing angle must be larger because the low-energy electrons that result\nfrom multiple Compton scattering get large disruption angles in collisions with\nthe opposing electron beam and some deflection in the solenoidal detector\nfield. For a 2E=500 GeV collider, the required crossing angle is about 25 mrad.\nIn this paper, we consider the factors that determine the crossing angle as\nwell as its minimum permissible value that does not yet cause a considerable\nreduction of the gamma-gamma luminosity. It is shown that the best solution is\nto increase the laser wavelength from the current 1 \\mum (which is optimal for\n2E=500 GeV) to 2 \\mum as this makes possible achieving high gamma-gamma\nluminosities at a crossing angle of 20 mrad, which is also quite comfortable\nfor e+e- collisions, does not cause any degradation of the e+e- luminosity and\nopens the possibility for a more energetic future collider in the same tunnel\n(e.g., CLIC). Moreover, the 2 \\mum wavelength is optimal for a 2E = 1 TeV\ncollider, e.g., a possible ILC energy upgrade.

If\nthis is the case, there is the possibility that there might be three body bound\nstates with two charmed mesons and a charmed antimeson.

That is, it can also have a geometric spectrum.

ACT, with its third generation polarization sensitive\narray, Advanced ACTPol, is being used to measure the anisotropies of the CMB in\nfive frequency bands in large areas of the sky ($\\sim 15,000$ $\\rm deg^2$).\nThese measurements are designed to characterize the large scale structure of\nthe universe, test cosmological models and constrain the sum of the neutrino\nmasses. As the sensitivity of these wide surveys increases, the control and\nvalidation of the far sidelobe response becomes increasingly important and is\nparticularly challenging as multiple reflections, spillover, diffraction and\nscattering become difficult to model and characterize at the required levels.\nIn this work, we present a ray trace model of the ACT upper structure which is\nused to describe much of the observed far sidelobe pattern.

When the first planet\nreaches the inner edge of the disk its migration stops and the second planet is\nlocked in resonance. We detail the resonant trapping comparing semi-analytical\nformulae and numerical simulations in the case of two equal-mass coplanar\nplanets trapped in first order resonances. We describe the family of resonant\nstable equilibrium points (zero-amplitude libration orbits) using expanded and\nnon-expanded Hamiltonians. We show that during convergent migration the planets\nevolve along these families of equilibria. Eccentricity damping from the disk\nleads to a final equilibrium configuration that we predict analytically. The\nfact that observed multi-exoplanetary systems are rarely seen in resonances\nsuggests that the resonant configurations achieved by migration can become\nunstable after the removal of the disk. We probe the stability of the\nresonances as a function of planetary mass. To do this, we fictitiously\nincrease the masses of the planets, adiabatically maintaining the low-amplitude\nlibration regime until instability. We discuss two hypotheses for instability:\nlow-order secondary resonance of the libration frequency with a fast synodic\nfrequency, and minimal approach distance between planets. We show that\nsecondary resonances do not seem to impact resonant systems at low-amplitude of\nlibration. Resonant systems are more stable than non-resonant ones for a given\nminimal distance at close encounters, but we show that the latter still play\nthe decisive role in the destabilisation of resonant pairs. We show that, as\nthe planetary mass increases and the minimal distance between planets gets\nsmaller in terms of mutual Hill radius, the region of stability around the\nresonance center shrinks, until the equilibrium point itself becomes unstable. \n\n"}

In particular, we find that these stars segregate in the K-[12]\nvs. [12]-[25] color-color diagram, and have distinct properties of the IRAS LRS\nspectra, including the peak position of the silicate emission feature. We show\nthat the infrared emission from the majority of non-Mira stars cannot be\nexplained within the context of standard steady-state outflow models. The\nmodels can be altered to fit the data for non-Mira stars by postulating\nnon-standard optical properties for silicate grains, or by assuming that the\ndust temperature at the inner envelope radius is significantly lower (300-400\nK) than typical silicate grain condensation temperatures (800-1000 K). We argue\nthat the latter is more probable and provide detailed model fits to the IRAS\nLRS spectra for 342 stars. These fits imply that 2/3 of non-Mira stars and 1/3\nof Mira stars do not have hot dust ($>$ 500 K) in their envelopes. The absence\nof hot dust can be interpreted as a recent (order of 100 yr) decrease in the\nmass-loss rate. The distribution of best-fit model parameters agrees with this\ninterpretation and strongly suggests that the mass loss resumes on similar time\nscales. Such a possibility appears to be supported by a number of spatially\nresolved observations (e.g. recent HST images of the multiple shells in the Egg\nNebula) and is consistent with new dynamical models for mass loss on the\nAsymptotic Giant Branch. \n\n"}

We use the formalism\nintroduced by Mo, Mao, & White to compute the observable properties of galaxies\nin a number of model populations, varying assumptions about which physical\nparameters determine structural quantities and star formation histories. We\nthen apply PCA to these model populations. Our baseline model assumes that halo\nmass, spin parameter, and formation redshift are the governing input parameters\nand that star formation is determined by surface density through a Schmidt law.\n  In all cases, the first principal component is primarily a measure of the\nshape of the spectral energy distribution (SED), and it is usually driven by\nvariations in the spin parameter, which influences star formation through the\ndisk surface density. The second and (in some cases) third principal components\nconsist mainly of ``scale'' parameters like luminosity, disk radius, and\ncircular velocity. However, the detailed division of these scale parameters,\nthe disk surface brightness, and the rotation curve slope among the principal\ncomponents changes significantly from model to model. Our calculations yield\npredictions of principal component structure for the baseline model of disk\ngalaxy formation, and a physical interpretation of these predictions.

This confirms\nquantitatively earlier speculations that early-type galaxies are calcium\nunderabundant. We find a clear correlation between alpha/Ca ratio and central\nvelocity dispersion, which implies that more massive galaxies are more calcium\nunderabundant. Interestingly this correlation extends down to the dwarf\nspheroidal galaxies of the Local Group for which alpha/Ca ratios have been\nmeasured from high-resolution spectroscopy of individual stars (Shetrone et\nal.). The increase of the calcium underabundance with galaxy mass balances the\nhigher total metallicities of more massive galaxies, so that calcium abundance\nin early-type galaxies is fairly constant and in particular does not increase\nwith increasing galaxy mass. This result may be the key to understand why the\nCaII triplet absorption of early-type galaxies at 8600 A is constant to within\n5 per cent over a large range of velocity dispersions (Saglia et al.; Cenarro\net al.). The origin of the calcium underabundance in early-type galaxies\nremains yet to be understood. We argue that formation timescales are\ndisfavoured to produce calcium underabundance, and that the option of\nmetallicity dependent supernova yields may be the most promising track to\nfollow. \n\n"}

However, for sufficiently large\nf_NL, the naive 3-point function estimator has a much larger variance than\npreviously thought. In the limit in which the departure from Gaussianity is\ndetected with high confidence, error bars on f_NL only decrease as 1/ln Npix\nrather than Npix^-1/2 as the size of the data set increases. We identify the\nphysical origin of this behavior and explain why it only affects the local type\nof non-Gaussianity, where the contribution of the first multipoles is always\nrelevant.

Near this cutoff energy,\nthe stream contribution to the annual modulation of recoils in the detector is\ncomparable to that of the thermalized halo, even if the stream represents only\na small portion (~5% or less) of the local halo density. Consequently the total\nmodulation may be quite different than would be expected for the standard halo\nmodel alone: it may not be cosine-like and can peak at a different date than\nexpected. The effects of speed, direction, density, and velocity dispersion of\na stream on the modulation are examined.

Alternatively, the\npresence of a dropoff in the recoil spectrum can be used to determine the WIMP\nmass if the stream speed is known. The annual modulation of the cutoff energy\ntogether with the annual modulation of the overall signal provide a \"smoking\ngun\" for WIMP detection. \n\n"}

However, a maximum entropy state does not always exist and the\nsystem may undergo a ``gravothermal catastrophe'': it can achieve ever\nincreasing values of entropy by developing a dense and hot ``core'' surrounded\nby a low density ``halo''. In this paper, we study the phase transition between\n``equilibrium'' states and ``collapsed'' states with the aid of a simple\nrelaxation equation [Chavanis, Sommeria and Robert, Astrophys. J. 471, 385\n(1996)] constructed so as to increase entropy with an optimal rate while\nconserving mass and energy. With this numerical algorithm, we can cover the\nwhole bifurcation diagram in parameter space and check, by an independent\nmethod, the stability limits of Katz [Mon. Not. R. astr. Soc. 183, 765 (1978)]\nand Padmanabhan [Astrophys. J. Supp. 71, 651 (1989)].

The approach uses two essential principles: (a) the physical\ntheories must be formulated for each observer entirely in terms of variables\nany given observer can access and (b) consistent formulation of quantum field\ntheory requires analytic continuation to the complex plane. These two\nprinciples, when used together in spacetimes with horizons, are powerful enough\nto provide several results in a unified manner. Since spacetimes with horizons\nhave a generic behaviour under analytic continuation, standard results of\nquantum field theory in curved spacetimes with horizons can be obtained\ndirectly (Sections III to VII). The requirements (a) and (b) also put strong\nconstraints on the action principle describing the gravity and, in fact, one\ncan obtain the Einstein-Hilbert action from the thermodynamic considerations.\nThe latter part of the review (Sections VIII to X) investigates this deeper\nconnection between gravity, spacetime microstructure and thermodynamics of\nhorizons.

Whether or not the\neffect is significant for number counts depends on the associated angular\nscales and on the distribution of inhomogeneities in the universe.

KK number is violated by loop effects because of\nthe orbifold imposed to reproduce the chiral Standard Model with zero modes,\nhowever, a KK parity remains at any order in perturbation theory which leads to\nthe existence of a stable lightest KK particle (LKP).
