We then present in some detail the main\ningredients of any transport method using in particular the Giessen\nBoltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (GiBUU) implementation of this theory as an\nexample. We discuss the potentials used, the ground state initialization and\nthe collision term, including the in-medium modifications of the latter. The\ncentral part of this review covers applications of GiBUU to a wide class of\nreactions, starting from pion-induced reactions over proton and antiproton\nreactions on nuclei to heavy-ion collisions (up to about 30 AGeV). A major part\nconcerns also the description of photon-, electron- and neutrino-induced\nreactions (in the energy range from a few 100 MeV to a few 100 GeV). For this\nwide class of reactions GiBUU gives an excellent description with the same\nphysics input and the same code being used. We argue that GiBUU is an\nindispensable tool for any investigation of nuclear reactions in which\nfinal-state interactions play a role. Studies of pion-nucleus interactions,\nnuclear fragmentation, heavy ion reactions, hyper nucleus formation,\nhadronization, color transparency, electron-nucleus collisions and\nneutrino-nucleus interactions are all possible applications of GiBUU and are\ndiscussed in this article. \n\n"}

Modification of\nheavy-flavor production in heavy-ion collisions relative to binary-collision\nscaling from p+p results, quantified with the nuclear-modification factor\n(R_AA), provides information on both cold- and hot-nuclear-matter effects.\n  Purpose: Determine transverse-momentum, pt, spectra and the corresponding\nR_AA for muons from heavy-flavor mesons decay in p+p and Cu+Cu collisions at\nsqrt(s_NN)=200 GeV and y=1.65.\n  Method: Results are obtained using the semi-leptonic decay of heavy-flavor\nmesons into negative muons. The PHENIX muon-arm spectrometers measure the p_T\nspectra of inclusive muon candidates. Backgrounds, primarily due to light\nhadrons, are determined with a Monte-Carlo calculation using a set of input\nhadron distributions tuned to match measured-hadron distributions in the same\ndetector and statistically subtracted.\n  Results: The charm-production cross section in p+p collisions at sqrt{s}=200\nGeV, integrated over pt and in the rapidity range 1.4<y<1.9 is found to be\ndsigma_ccbar/dy = 0.139 +/- 0.029 (stat) ^{+0.051}_{-0.058} (syst) mb.

Using\nBayesian inference makes it possible to take into account the theoretical\nuncertainties on the nuclear matrix elements in a fully consistent way. First,\nwe analyze the data used to claim the observation of neutrinoless double beta\ndecay in Ge-76, and find strong evidence (according to Jeffrey's scale) for a\npeak in the spectrum and moderate evidence for that the peak is actually close\nto the energy expected for the neutrinoless decay. We also find a significantly\nlarger statistical error than the original analysis, which we include in the\ncomparison with other data. Then, we statistically test the consistency between\nthis claim with that of recent measurements using Xe-136. We find that the two\ndata sets are about 40 to 80 times more probable under the assumption that they\nare inconsistent, depending on the nuclear matrix element uncertainties and the\nprior on the smallest neutrino mass. Hence, there is moderate to strong\nevidence of incompatibility, and for equal prior probabilities the posterior\nprobability of compatibility is between 1.3% and 2.5%.

Furthermore,\nadditional data have been analyzed resulting in photon electroproduction cross\nsections at new kinematic settings, for a total of 588 experimental bins.\nResults of the $Q^2$- and $x_B$-dependences of both the helicity-dependent and\nhelicity-independent cross sections are discussed. The $Q^2$-dependence\nillustrates the dominance of the twist-2 handbag amplitude in the kinematics of\nthe experiment, as previously noted.

Among them is the Chiral\nMagnetic Effect (CME) -- the generation of electric current along an external\nmagnetic field induced by chirality imbalance. Because the chirality imbalance\nis related to the global topology of gauge fields, the CME current is\ntopologically protected and hence non-dissipative even in the presence of\nstrong interactions.

To this end, we introduce a stochastic model of the residual magnetic\nfield within the propagation region which draws on features of magnetic\nprofiles measured during the last free neutron oscillation experiment\n[conducted at the Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL) in the 1990's]. We average over\nboth fluctuations in the magnetic field sampled by neutrons, and representative\nspectra of neutron speeds. We find that deviations from the quasi-free result\nfor the antineutron probability do not depend quadratically on $l$ (as a naive\nperturbative estimate would suggest) but increase only linearly with $l$. As\nregards the large spikes in the magnetic field which can be expected at, for\nexample, joints in the magnetic shielding of the propagation region (despite\ncompensating currents and magnetic idealization of the shield), we demonstrate\nthat their effect scales as $l/D^{3/2}$, where $D$ is the diameter of the\ncylindrical magnetic shielding. Our arguments suggest that, provided the\ndimensions of the propagation region are such that the ratio $l/D^{3/2}$ does\nnot exceed the value pertinent to the ILL experiment, and these spikes occur\nclose to either end of the propagation region, they can be neglected. We also\nestablish that any large magnetic field encountered after the propagation\nregion is exited will not diminish the probability for antineutron detection.\nFor the range of values of $l$ of most interest to the ESS experiment, it\nshould suffice to improve on the level of magnetic suppression achieved at the\nILL by a factor of two. \n\n"}

These factorization breaking effects arise from soft color\nexchanges between charm-anticharm pairs undergoing hadronization and comoving\npartons that are long-lived on time scales of quarkonium formation. We compute\nthe short distance pair production of heavy quarks in the Color Glass\nCondensate (CGC) effective field theory and employ an improved Color\nEvaporation model (ICEM) to describe their hadronization into quarkonium at\nlarge distances. The combined CGC+ICEM model provides a quantitative\ndescription of $J/\\psi$ and $\\psi(2S)$ data in proton-proton (p+p) collisions\nfrom both RHIC and the LHC.

We came to\nthis picture after analyzing the behaviour of the nuclear modification factor\nas a function of $p_T$ for the charged particles produced in the most central\nPb-Pb collisions at 2.76 A TeV. In the interval, $7-50 GeV/c$ the values of the\nfactor as a function of $p_T$ increases almost linearly with a slope is very\nclose to expected one for the inverse Compton effect. Around $p_T\\simeq 60$\nGeV/c, a regime change occurs, which is characteristic for the phenomenon. We\npropose that this similarity can be explained by the inverse Compton effect for\npartons, which occurs via a collective parton group formation ( through the\nappearance of a new string as a result of the fusion of strings) and its\ninteractions with single partons in the interval of $5 < p_T < 10 GeV/c$.

A second component is a local\nfunctional of the density and is obtained by applying the density matrix\nexpansion to the exchange part (Fock term) of the expectation value of the\nlocal chiral potential. We apply the UNEDF2 optimization protocol to determine\nthe coupling constants of this energy functional.

To find functional forms\nthat will allow for a robust extraction of the input radius for a wide variety\nof functional forms in order to have confidence in the extraction from upcoming\nlow $Q^2$ experimental data such as the Jefferson Lab PRad experiment, we\ncreate a general framework for inputting form-factor functions as well as\nvarious fitting functions.

All combinations of input functions\nand fit functions can then be tested repeatedly against regenerated\npseudo-data.

This correction can modify the cross section at the few percent\nlevel. In contrast, dispersive effects can cause significantly larger changes\nfrom the Born approximation. The purpose of this experiment is to extract the\ncarbon-12 elastic cross section around the first diffraction minimum, where the\nBorn term contributions to the cross section are small to maximize the\nsensitivity to dispersive effects. The analysis uses the LEDEX data from the\nhigh resolution Jefferson Lab Hall A spectrometers to extract the cross\nsections near the first diffraction minimum of 12C at beam energies of 362 MeV\nand 685 MeV.

The jet shapes were measured for a small resolution parameter $R\n= 0.2$ and were fully corrected to particle level.

The soft partons, represented by strings, melt into a\nthermalized medium which is described by a 3 dimensional event-by-event viscous\nhydrodynamic approach.

With the advent of\nQCD the goal of locating, and characterizing the hadron-parton deconfinement\nphase transformation suggested the need for higher $\\sqrt{s}$, the research\nthus moving to the BNL AGS and CERN SPS, finally to RHIC at BNL. A set of\nphysics observables is discussed where present data span the entire $\\sqrt{s}$\ndomain, from Bevalac and SIS at GSI, to top RHIC energy. Referring,\nselectively, to data concerning bulk hadron production, the overall $\\sqrt{s}$\nevolution of directed and radial flow observables, and of pion pair\nBose-Einstein correlation are discussed. The hadronization process is studied\nin the grand canonical statistical model. The resulting hadronization points in\nthe plane T vs. $\\mu_B$ converge onto the parton-hadron phase boundary\npredicted by finite $\\mu_B$ lattice QCD, from top SPS to RHIC energy. At lower\nSPS and top AGS energy a steep strangeness maximum occurs at which the\nWroblewski parameter $\\lambda_s \\approx $ 0.6; a possible connection to the QCD\ncritical point is discussed.

The identification of particles relies on three different methods:\nlow momentum particles stopping in the first detector layers; the specific\nenergy loss (dE/dx) in the silicon Spectrometer, and Time-of-Flight\nmeasurement. These methods cover the transverse momentum ranges 0.03-0.2,\n0.2-1.0 and 0.5-3.0 GeV/c, respectively. Baryons are found to have\nsubstantially harder transverse momentum spectra than mesons.

It is shown that for low\ncollision energies possible nuclear reactions (including deuterium fusion) are\nstrongly boosted by the environment.

The microscopic correlator method is used to enforce conservation\nof three charges - baryon number, electric charge, and strangeness - in the\ncanonical ensemble. In addition, in the micro-canonical ensemble energy\nconservation is included. An analytical method is used to account for resonance\ndecays. The multiplicity distributions and the scaled variances for negatively,\npositively, and all charged hadrons are calculated along the chemical\nfreeze-out line of central Pb+Pb (Au+Au) collisions from SIS to LHC energies.\nPredictions obtained within different statistical ensembles are compared with\nthe preliminary NA49 experimental results on central Pb+Pb collisions in the\nSPS energy range. The measured fluctuations are significantly narrower than the\nPoisson ones and clearly favor expectations for the micro-canonical ensemble.\nThus this is a first observation of the recently predicted suppression of the\nmultiplicity fluctuations in relativistic gases in the thermodynamical limit\ndue to conservation laws. \n\n"}

Abstract: The centrality dependence of (multi-)strange hadron abundances is studied for\nPb(158 AGeV)Pb reactions and compared to p(158 GeV)Pb collisions. The\nmicroscopic transport model UrQMD is used for this analysis. The predicted\nLambda/pi-, Xi-/pi- and Omega-/pi- ratios are enhanced due to rescattering in\ncentral Pb-Pb collisions as compared to peripheral Pb-Pb or p-Pb collisions. A\nreduction of the constituent quark masses to the current quark masses m_s \\sim\n230 MeV, m_q \\sim 10 MeV, as motivated by chiral symmetry restoration, enhances\nthe hyperon yields to the experimentally observed high values. Similar results\nare obtained by an ad hoc overall increase of the color electric field strength\n(effective string tension of kappa=3 GeV/fm). The enhancement depends strongly\non the kinematical cuts. The maximum enhancement is predicted around\nmidrapidity. For Lambda's, strangeness suppression is predicted at\nprojectile/target rapidity. For Omega's, the predicted enhancement can be as\nlarge as one order of magnitude. Comparisons of Pb-Pb data to proton induced\nasymmetric (p-A) collisions are hampered due to the predicted strong asymmetry\nin the various rapidity distributions of the different (strange) particle\nspecies. In p-Pb collisions, strangeness is locally (in rapidity) not\nconserved. The present comparison to the data of the WA97 and NA49\ncollaborations clearly supports the suggestion that conventional (free)\nhadronic scenarios are unable to describe the observed high (anti-)hyperon\nyields in central collisions. The doubling of the strangeness to nonstrange\nsuppression factor, gamma_s \\approx 0.65, might be interpreted as a signal of a\nphase of nearly massless particles. \n\n"}

{"id": "nucl-th/9908013", "contents": "Title: Looking For Disoriented Chiral Condensates From Pion Distributions Abstract: We suggest two methods for the detection of the formation of disoriented\nchiral condensates in heavy ion collisions. We show that the variance in the\nnumber of charged pions (in a suitable range of momentum space) provides a\nsignature for the observation of a disoriented chiral condensate. The signal\nshould be observable even if multiple domains of D$\\chi$C form provided the\naverage number of pions per domain is significantly larger than unity. The\nvariance of the number charged pions alone provides a signal which can be used\neven if the number of neutral pions cannot be measured in a given detector. On\nthe other hand, the probability distribution in $R$, the proportion of neutral\npions to all pions emitted in heavy ion collisions in certain kinematic\nregions, has been suggested as a signal of a disoriented chiral condensate.\nHere we note that the signature can be greatly enhanced by making suitable cuts\nin the data. In particular, we consider reducing the data set such that the $k$\npions with lowest $p_T$ are all neutral. We find that, given such cuts, $<R>$\ncan be substantially different from 1/3. For example, for a single D$\\chi$C\ndomain without contamination due to incoherently emitted pions, $<R>$ is 3/5\ngiven the pion with lowest $p_T$ is neutral, and 5/7 given the two pions with\nlowest $p_T$ are both neutral, {\\it etc.}. The effects of multi-domain D$\\chi$C\nformation and noise due to incoherent pion emission can be systematically\nincorporated. Potential applications to experiments and their limitations are\nbriefly discussed. \n\n"}

In addition, the Delta J\n= 1 staggering effect (i.e. the relative displacement of the levels with even\nangular momentum J with respect to the levels of the same band with odd J) is\nstudied in molecular bands free from Delta J = 2 staggering (i.e. free from\ninterband interactions/bandcrossings). Bands of YD offer evidence for the\nabsence of any Delta J = 1 staggering effect due to the disparity of nuclear\nmasses, while bands of sextet electronic states of CrD demonstrate that Delta J\n= 1 staggering is a sensitive probe of deviations from rotational behaviour,\ndue in this particular case to the spin-rotation and spin-spin interactions. \n\n"}
