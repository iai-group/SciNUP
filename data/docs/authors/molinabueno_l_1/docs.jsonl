Some theoretical\nestimates for the cores of relaxed clusters predict an excess of helium\nabundance by up to a factor of a few over its primordial value. The\nintracluster helium abundance cannot be measured directly. This presents a\nsignificant source of uncertainty for cosmological tests based on the X-ray\nderived cluster quantities, such as the gas mass, total mass, and gas mass\nfraction, all of which depend on the assumed helium abundance.

This dependence can be used to\nmeasure the abundance, provided the distance is known independently. For\nexample, if one adopts the WMAP H_0 value, then the recent H_0 measurement by\nBonamente and collaborators, derived from SZ data on 38 clusters assuming a\nprimordial helium abundance, corresponds to an abundance excess by a factor of\n1.9+-0.8 within r~1 Mpc (using only their statistical errors).

This scenario was developed to replace and extend the\nso-called standard cooling scenario to include neutrino emission from the\nCooper pair breaking and formation processes that occur near the critical\ntemperature for superfluid/superconductor pairing.\n  Recently, it has been found that Cooper-pair neutrino emission from the\nvector channel is suppressed by a large factor compared to the original\nestimates that violated vector current conservation. We show that Cooper-pair\nneutrino emission remains, nevertheless, an efficient cooling mechanism through\nthe axial channel. As a result, the elimination of neutrino emission from\nCooper-paired nucleons through the vector channel has only minor effects on the\nlong-term cooling of neutron stars within the minimal cooling paradigm. We\nfurther quantify precisely the effect of the size of the neutron 3P2 gap and\ndemonstrate that consistency between observations and the minimal cooling\nparadigm requires that the critical temperature T_c for this gap covers a range\nof values between T_c^min < 0.2 x 10^9 K up to T_c^max > 0.5 \\times 10^9 K in\nthe core of the star.

Nearly independent of\nviewing angle and \\dot{M}, the power spectrum over the range of frequencies\nfrom approximately the orbital frequency at the innermost stable circular orbit\n(ISCO) to ~100 times lower is well approximated by a power-law with index -2,\ncrudely consistent with the observed power spectra of hard X-ray fluctuations\nin AGN and the hard states of Galactic binary black holes. The underlying\nphysical driver for variability in the light curve is variations in the\naccretion rate caused by the chaotic character of MHD turbulence, but the power\nspectrum of the coronal light output is significantly steeper. Part of this\ncontrast is due to the fact that the mass accretion rate can be significantly\nmodulated by radial epicyclic motions that do not result in dissipation, and\ntherefore do not drive luminosity fluctuations.

Thus confirms a real source detection reported previously. The source\nposition and error location are therefore updated. The source is found to be\nconstant over years at the hard X-rays. Over the three XRT observations, the\nsource flux varied by up to 39% from the average, and the spectrum is generally\nsoft.

In this article, we study the propagation of UHECR\nnuclei with the goal of using these measurements, along with those of the shape\nof the spectrum, to constrain the chemical composition of the particles\naccelerated by the sources of the UHECRs.

By cross-correlating the SDSS DR5 quasar catalog with the\nXMM-Newton archive, we create a sample of 327 quasars with X-ray S/N > 6, where\nboth optical and X-ray spectra are available. This allows alpha_ox to be\ndefined at arbitrary frequencies, rather than the standard 2500 Angstroms and 2\nkeV. We find that while the choice of optical wavelength does not strongly\ninfluence the alpha_ox-l_opt relation, the slope of the relation does depend on\nthe choice of X-ray energy. The slope of the relation becomes steeper when\nalpha_ox is defined at low (~ 1 keV) X-ray energies. This change is significant\nwhen compared to the slope predicted by a decrease in the baseline over which\nalpha_ox is defined. The slopes are also marginally flatter than predicted at\nhigh (~ 10 keV) X-ray energies. Partial correlation tests show that while the\nprimary driver of alpha_ox is l_opt, the Eddington ratio correlates strongly\nwith alpha_ox when l_opt is taken into account, so accretion rate may help\nexplain these results. We combine the alpha_ox-l_opt and Gamma -L_bol/L_Edd\nrelations to naturally explain two results: 1) the existence of the Gamma-l_x\nrelation as reported in Young et al. (2009) and 2) the lack of a Gamma-l_opt\nrelation. The consistency of the optical/X-ray correlations establishes a more\ncomplete framework for understanding the relation between quasar emission\nmechanisms. We also discuss two correlations with the hard X-ray bolometric\ncorrection, which we show correlates with both alpha_ox and Eddington ratio.\nThis confirms that an increase in accretion rate correlates with a decrease in\nthe fraction of up-scattered disk photons. \n\n"}

Correct interstellar absorption as well as effects of dust scattering\nare fully taken into account in the spectral analysis. The energy spectra in\nthe 2-120 keV band in both states are all dominated by strong Comptonization of\ndisk photons by an optically thick (\\tau ~7-10) and low temperature (T_e ~2-3\nkeV) hybrid plasmas containing non-thermal electrons produced with 10-60% of\nthe total power input. Absorption lines of highly ionized Fe ions detected\nduring the oscillation indicate that a strong disk wind is developed. The\nionization stage of the wind correlates with the X-ray flux, supporting the\nphotoionization origin. The iron-K emission line shows a strong variability\nduring the oscillation; the reflection is strongest during the dip but\ndisappears during the flare.

However,\nflares and prompt pulses differ in one crucial aspect: flares evolve with time.\nAs time proceeds flares become wider, with larger peak lag, lower luminosities\nand softer emission. The flare spectral peak energy E_{p,i} evolves to lower\nvalues following an exponential decay which tracks the decay of the flare flux.\nThe two flares with best statistics show higher than expected isotropic energy\nE_{iso} and peak luminosity L_{p,iso} when compared to the E_{p,i}-E_{iso} and\nE_{p,i}-L_{iso} prompt correlations. E_{p,i} is found to correlate with L_{iso}\nwithin single flares, giving rise to a time resolved E_{p,i}(t)-L_{iso}(t).\nLike prompt pulses, flares define a lag-luminosity relation: L_{p,iso}^{0.3-10\nkeV} t_{lag}^{-0.95+/-0.23}.

The best agreement with the exact result\nis found from effective-one-body (EOB) calculations that are fit to numerical\nrelativity simulations. However, if one considers uncalibrated methods based\nonly on the currently known 3PN-order conservative dynamics, the best agreement\nis found from the gauge-invariant ISCO condition of Blanchet and Iyer (2003).\nThis method reproduces the exact test-particle limit without any resummation.

To address this problem, I introduce a Bayesian method for\nestimating the intrinsic parameters of a star and its line-of-sight extinction.\nIt uses both photometry and parallaxes in a self-consistent manner in order to\nprovide a non-parametric posterior probability distribution over the\nparameters. The method makes explicit use of domain knowledge by employing the\nHertzsprung--Russell Diagram (HRD) to constrain solutions and to ensure that\nthey respect stellar physics. I first demonstrate this method by using it to\nestimate effective temperature and extinction from BVJHK data for a set of\nartificially reddened Hipparcos stars, for which accurate effective\ntemperatures have been estimated from high resolution spectroscopy. Using just\nthe four colours, we see the expected strong degeneracy (positive correlation)\nbetween the temperature and extinction.

We conduct 2-D hydrodynamic simulations\nto study the quasi-steady-state properties of such coronae as the natural\nproducts of the ongoing distributed stellar feedback semi-confined by the\nthermal and ram pressures of the ICM. We find that the temperature of a\nsimulated corona depends primarily on the specific energy of the feedback,\nconsistent with the lack of the correlation between the observed hot gas\ntemperature and K-band luminosity of galaxies. The simulated coronae typically\nrepresent subsonic outflows, chiefly because of the semi-confinement. As a\nresult, the hot gas density increases with the ICM thermal pressure. The ram\npressure, on the other hand, chiefly affects the size and lopsidedness of the\ncoronae. The density increase could lead to the compression of cool gas clouds,\nif present, and hence the formation of stars. The increase also enhances\nradiative cooling of the hot gas, which may fuel central supermassive black\nholes, explaining the higher frequency of active galactic nuclei observed in\nclusters than in the field.

To\ntackle the nonlinear processes of galaxy-MBH interaction, we describe a\nself-consistent numerical framework which incorporates both galaxies and MBHs.\nThe high-resolution adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) code Enzo is modified to\nmodel the formation and feedback of molecular clouds at their characteristic\nscale of 15.2 pc and the accretion of gas onto a MBH. Two major channels of MBH\nfeedback, radiative feedback (X-ray photons followed through full 3D adaptive\nray tracing) and mechanical feedback (bipolar jets resolved in high-resolution\nAMR), are employed. We investigate the coevolution of a 9.2e11 Msun galactic\nhalo and its 1e5 Msun embedded MBH at redshift 3 in a cosmological LCDM\nsimulation.

The feedback considerably changes the stellar\ndistribution there. This new channel of feedback from a slowly growing MBH is\nparticularly interesting because it is only locally dominant, and does not\nrequire the heating of gas globally on the disk.

Optical spectroscopy of this object has suggested a distance of ~7\nkpc and an identification with a low mass X-ray binary. We instead use the\nX-ray data from 0.3-40 keV to identify the source as a bright intermediate\npolar (IP) with an estimate for the white dwarf mass of~0.60 M_solar. This\nidentification is supported by the presence of an iron triplet, the component\nlines of which are some of the strongest seen in IPs; and the signature of the\nspin period of the white dwarf at ~24 mins. We note that the lack of broad-band\nvariability may suggest that this object is a stream-fed IP, similar in many\nrespects to the well studied IP, V2400 Oph.

We vary four parameters: the gas polytropic\nindex Gamma, its temperature at large radii T_xi, the DM logarithmic slope at\nlarge radii zeta and its concentration c_vir. When comparing the model to the\nobserved mass-temperature (M-T) relation of local clusters, our results are\nindependent of both T_xi and c_vir. We thus obtain constraints on Gamma, by\nfixing the DM profile, and on zeta, by fixing the gas profile. For an NFW DM\nprofile, we find that 6/5<Gamma<13/10, which is consistent with numerical\nsimulations and observations of individual clusters. Taking 6/5<Gamma<13/10\nallows the DM profile to be slightly steeper than the NFW profile at large\nradii. Upon including local groups, we constrain the mass-dependence of Gamma\nand the value of T_xi. Interestingly, with Gamma=6/5 and zeta=-3, we reproduce\nthe observed steepening/breaking of the M-T relation at low M, if 10^6\nK<T_xi<10^7 K, consistent with simulations and observations of the warm-hot\nintergalactic medium. When extrapolated to high redshift z, the model with a\nconstant Gamma reproduces the expected self-similar behaviour. We also account\nfor the observed, non-self-similar relations provided by some high-z clusters,\nas they provide constraints on the evolution of Gamma. Comparing our model to\nthe observed luminosity-temperature relation, we discriminate between different\nM-c_vir relations: a weak dependence of c_vir on M is currently preferred by\ndata. This simple theoretical model accounts for much of the complexity of\nrecent, improved X-ray scaling relations, provided that we allow for a mild\ndependence of Gamma on M or for T_xi consistent with intercluster values.\n[abridged] \n\n"}

However a major uncertainty is the estimate of the orbital\ninclination angle of an X-ray binary. Here we suggest to measure the black hole\nmass in an X-ray binary by measuring directly the black hole's orbital motion,\nthus obtaining the companion to black hole mass ratio. In this method we assume\nthat accretion disk wind moves with the black hole and thus the black hole's\norbital motion can be obtained from the Doppler velocity of the absorption\nlines produced in the accretion disk wind. We validate this method by analyzing\nthe Chandra/HETG observations of GRO J1655-40, in which the black hole orbital\nmotion with line of sight velocity of 90.8 (+-11.3) km/s, inferred from the\nDoppler velocity of disk-wind absorption lines, is consistent with the\nprediction from its previously measured system parameters. We obtain the black\nhole mass of 5.41 (+0.98, -0.57) solar masses and system inclination of 72.0\n(+7.8, -7.5) degrees in GRO J1655-40. Additional observations of this source\ncovering more orbital phases can improve estimates on its system parameters\nsubstantially. We then apply the method to the black hole X-ray binary LMC X-3\nobserved with HST/COS near orbital phase 0.75. We find that the disk-wind\nabsorption lines of CIV doublet were shifted to about 50 km/s, which yields a\ncompanion-to-black-hole mass ratio of 0.6 for an assumed disk wind velocity of\n-400 km/s. Additional observations covering other orbital phases (0.25 in\nparticular) are crucial to ease this assumption and then to directly constrain\nthe mass ratio. This method in principle can also be applied to any accreting\ncompact objects with detectable accretion disk wind absorption line features. \n\n"}

In contrast, because of their higher charge, iron-peaked nuclei\nare still accelerated to the highest observed energies at later times, when the\nenvelope has become thin enough to allow their escape. Ultrahigh energy iron\nnuclei escape newly-born pulsars with millisecond periods and dipole magnetic\nfields of ~10^(12-13) G, embedded in core-collapse supernovae.

This turbulence is\npotentially strong enough to reaccelerate relativistic electron seeds (with\ninitial $\\gamma \\sim 100-500$) to $\\gamma \\sim 10^4$ via damping of\nmagnetosonic waves and non-resonant compression.

As most of the gas stripping takes\nplace near the boundary between the ISM and the intraclustermedium (ICM), the\nboost in the ISM stripping rate is due to the \"random walk\" of the ISM from the\ncentral regions of the galactic potential well to larger distances, where the\nram pressure is able to permanently remove the gas from galaxies. The ICM can\nbe temporarily trapped inside the galactic potential well due to the mixing of\nthe turbulent ISM with the ICM. The galaxies with more turbulent ISM, yet still\ncharacterised by very weak turbulence, can hold larger amounts of the ICM.\n[Abridged] \n\n"}

Early\noptical spectra exhibit broad, Type II-like hydrogen Balmer profiles that\nsubside rapidly and are replaced by Type Ib-like He-rich features on the\ntimescale of one week.

Radio observations imply a shock velocity of v = 0.13c\nand a progenitor star mass-loss rate of 1.4 x 10^{-5} Msun yr^{-1} (assuming\nwind velocity v_w=10^3 km/s).

The ensuing collision between the fast ejecta and the CSM causes an\nincrease in brightness observed at the end of 1844, followed by a sustained\nhigh-luminosity phase lasting for 10-15 years that matches the historical light\ncurve. The emergent luminosity is powered by CSM interaction, analogous to the\nprocess in luminous Type IIn supernovae, except with 10 times lower explosion\nenergy and at slower speeds (causing a longer duration and lower emergent\nluminosity). Such an explosive event provides a natural explanation for the\nlight curve evolution, but also accounts for a number of puzzling attributes of\nthe Homunculus nebula: (1) rough equipartition of total radiated and kinetic\nenergy, (2) the double-shell structure of the Homunculus, (3) the apparent\nsingle age and Hubble-like flow resulting from the thin swept-up shell, (4) the\ncomplex mottled appearance of the polar lobes in HST images, arising from\nRaleigh-Taylor or Vishniac instabilities, (5) efficient and rapid dust\nformation, as seen in Type IIn supernovae, and (6) the fast (5000 km/s)\nmaterial outside the Homunculus, arising from the acceleration of the forward\nshock upon exiting the dense CSM.

In this paper,\nwe suggest to add the \"amplitude\" of GRB prompt emission as the third dimension\nas a complementary criterion to classify GRBs, especially those of short\ndurations. We define three new parameters $f$, $f_{\\rm eff}$ and $f_{\\rm\neff,z}$ as ratios between the measured/simulated peak flux of a GRB/pseudo-GRB\nand the flux background, and discuss the applications of these parameters to\nGRB classification. We systematically derive these parameters to find that most\nshort GRBs are likely not \"tip-of-iceberg\" of long GRBs. However, one needs to\nbe cautious if a short GRB has a relatively small $f$ (e.g. $f<1.5$), since the\nchance for an intrinsically long GRB to appear as a \"disguised\" short GRB is\nhigher. Based on avaialble data, we quantify the probability of a disguised\nshort GRB below a certain $f$ value is as $P (<f)\\sim 0.78^{+0.71}_{-0.4}\nf^{-4.33\\pm 1.84}$.

These\noverdense gas substructures are generally a source of unresolved bias of X-ray\nobservations towards high density gas, but their bright luminosity peaks may be\nresolved sources within the ICM, that deep X-ray exposures may be (already)\ncapable to detect. In this paper we aim at investigating both features, using a\nset of high-resolution cosmological simulations with ENZO. First, we monitor\nhow the bias by unresolved gas clumping may yield incorrect estimates of global\ncluster parameters and affects the measurements of baryon fractions by X-ray\nobservations. We find that based on X-ray observations of narrow radial strips,\nit is difficult to recover the real baryon fraction to better than 10 - 20\npercent uncertainty. Second, we investigated the possibility of observing\nbright X-ray clumps in the nearby Universe (z<=0.3). We produced simple mock\nX-ray observations for several instruments (XMM, Suzaku and ROSAT) and\nextracted the statistics of potentially detectable bright clumps. Some of the\nbrightest clumps predicted by simulations may already have been already\ndetected in X- ray images with a large field of view.

This is especially established for a class of stripped\nenvelope supernovae (SNe IIb/Ib/Ic) where a combination of high shock velocity\nand low circumstellar material (CSM) density makes it easier to derive the\nintrinsic energy distribution than in other classes of SNe.

We develop the theory of angular momentum transport by acoustic modes\nin the boundary layer, and support our findings with 3D hydrodynamical\nsimulations, using an isothermal equation of state.

We set out a\nprocedure for doing QPO searches in the far more numerous, short, less\nenergetic magnetar bursts.

In the present article we\ninvestigate the non-congruence of the nuclear liquid-gas PT at sub-saturation\ndensities and the deconfinement PT at high densities and/or temperatures in\nCoulomb-less models, relevant for heavy-ion collisions and neutron stars. For\nthe first PT, we use the FSUgold relativistic mean-field model and for the\nsecond one the relativistic chiral SU(3) model. The chiral SU(3) model is one\nof the few models for the deconfinement PT, which contains quarks and hadrons\nin arbitrary proportions (i.e. a \"solution\") and gives a continuous transition\nfrom pure hadronic to pure quark matter above a critical point. The study shows\nthe universality of the applied concept of non-congruence for the two PTs with\nan upper critical point, and illustrates the different typical scales involved.\nIn addition, we find a principle difference between the liquid-gas and the\ndeconfinement PTs: in contrast to the ordinary Van-der-Waals-like PT, the phase\ncoexistence line of the deconfinement PT has a negative slope in the\npressure-temperature plane. As another qualitative difference we find that the\nnon-congruent features of the deconfinement PT become vanishingly small around\nthe critical point. \n\n"}

Pulsar acceleration implies a hard injection spectrum ($\\sim\nE^{-1}$) due to pulsar spin down and a maximum energy $E_{\\rm max} \\sim Z \\,\n10^{19}$ eV due to the limit on the spin rate of neutron stars. We have\npreviously shown that the escape through the young supernova remnant softens\nthe spectrum, decreases slightly the maximum energy, and generates secondary\nnuclei. Here we show that the distribution of pulsar birth periods and the\neffect of propagation in the interstellar and intergalactic media modifies the\ncombined spectrum of all pulsars.

Here we demonstrate that the scattering effects at lower\nradio frequencies are less than previously thought, and that the bursts could\nbe detectable at redshifts out to about $z=0.5$ in surveys below 1 GHz. Using a\nsource model in which the bursts are standard candles with bolometric\nluminosities $\\sim 8 \\times 10^{44}$ ergs/s uniformly distributed per unit\ncomoving volume, we derive an expression for the observed peak flux density as\na function of redshift and use this, together with the rate estimates found by\nThornton et al. to find an empirical relationship between event rate and\nredshift probed by a given survey. The non-detection of any such events in\nArecibo 1.4 GHz survey data by Deneva et al., and the Allen Telescope Array\nsurvey by Simeon et al. is consistent with our model.

After\nsaturation of the MRI, in many cases the disk maintains a steady vertical\nstructure for many thermal times. However, in every case in which the box size\nin the horizontal directions is at least one pressure scale height,\nfluctuations associated with MRI turbulence and dynamo action in the disk\neventually trigger a thermal runaway which causes the disk to either expand or\ncontract until the calculation must be terminated. During runaway, the\ndependence of the heating and cooling rates on total pressure satisfy the\nsimplest criterion for classical thermal instability.

However, we cannot exclude that\nlocal sources of CRs or X-ray photons nearby the cloud may provide much higher\nintensity of the line from there. Production of the line emission from\nmolecular clouds depends strongly on processes of CR penetration into them.

Due to the substantial\nangular momentum from the binary, such a remnant is born rapidly rotating and\nlikely acquires a strong magnetic field (a `millisecond magnetar'). Magnetic\nspin-down deposits a large fraction of the rotational energy from the magnetar\nbehind the small quantity of mass ejected during the merger. This has the\npotential for creating a bright transient that could be useful for determining\nwhether a NS or black hole was formed in the merger. We investigate the\nexpected signature of such an event, including for the first time the important\nimpact of electron/positron pairs injected by the millisecond magnetar into the\nsurrounding nebula. These pairs cool via synchrotron and inverse Compton\nemission, producing a pair cascade and hard X-ray spectrum. A fraction of these\nX-rays are absorbed by the ejecta walls and re-emitted as thermal radiation,\nleading to an optical/UV transient peaking at a luminosity of ~1e43-1e44 erg/s\non a timescale of several hours to days. This is dimmer than predicted by\nsimpler analytic models because the large optical depth of electron/positron\npairs across the nebula suppresses the efficiency with which the magnetar spin\ndown luminosity is thermalized. Nevertheless, the optical/UV emission is more\nthan two orders of magnitude brighter than a radioactively powered `kilonova.'\nIn some cases nebular X-rays are sufficiently luminous to re-ionize the ejecta,\nin which case non-thermal X-rays escape the ejecta unattenuated with a similar\npeak luminosity and timescale as the optical radiation.

We find that AGN\nfeedback has severe difficulty in breaking the relation in a consistent way.\nThe similarity breaking is directly linked to the gas evacuation within\n$R_{500}$, while the central cooling times are inversely proportional to the\ncore density. Breaking self-similarity implies thus breaking the cool core,\nmorphing all systems to non-cool-core objects, which is in clear contradiction\nwith the observed data populated by several cool-core systems.

We find that the object exhibits two distinct modes of\nemission; a strong mode with a broad profile and a weak mode with a narrow\nprofile. During the strong mode of emission, the pulsar typically radiates very\nenergetic emission over sequences of ~200-6000 pulses (~60 s-24 min), with\napparent nulls over time-scales of up to a few pulses at a time. Emission\nduring the weak mode is observed outside of these strong-mode sequences and\nmanifests as occasional bursts of up to a few clearly detectable pulses at a\ntime, as well as low-level underlying emission which is only detected through\nprofile integration. This implies that the previously described null mode may\nin fact be representative of the bottom-end of the pulse intensity distribution\nfor the source. This is supported by the dramatic pulse-to-pulse intensity\nmodulation and rarity of exceptionally bright pulses observed during both modes\nof emission.

The magnetar central\nengine model predicts an observable plateau phase, with plateau durations and\nluminosities being determined by the magnetic fields and spin periods of the\nnewly formed magnetar. This paper analytically shows that the magnetar central\nengine model can explain, within the 1$\\sigma$ uncertainties, the correlation\nbetween plateau luminosity and duration. The observed scatter in the\ncorrelation most likely originates in the spread of initial spin periods of the\nnewly formed magnetar and provides an estimate of the maximum spin period of\n~35 ms (assuming a constant mass, efficiency and beaming across the GRB\nsample).

As cosmic\nrays are mostly charged nuclei, their trajectories are deflected by the action\nof galactic magnetic field they propagate through before reaching the Earth\natmosphere, so that their detection carries directional information only up to\ndistances as large as their gyro-radius. If cosmic rays below\n$10^{15}{\\rm\\,eV}$ are considered and the local galactic magnetic field\n($\\sim3{\\rm\\,\\mu G}$) is accounted for, gyro-radii are so short that isotropy\nis expected.

This characteristic feature can\nbe quantified with the absorption measure distribution (AMD), defined as the\ndistribution of column density with ionization parameter |dN / dlog xi|.\nObserved AMDs extend over 0.1 < xi < 10^4 (cgs), and are remarkably similar in\ndifferent objects.

A common interpretation is a multiphase outflow, with a wide range of gas\ndensities in a uniform gas pressure medium. However, the incident radiation\npressure leads to a gas pressure gradient in the photoionized gas, and\ntherefore to a broad range of ionization states within a single slab.

We\ndescribe here a new method using time-delay lensed quasars where one or several\nimages are affected by microlensing due to stars in the lensing galaxy. Because\nmicrolensing decreases (or increases) the flux of the continuum compared to the\nbroad line region, it changes the contrast between these two emission\ncomponents. We show that this effect can be used to effectively disentangle the\nintrinsic variability of those two regions, offering the opportunity to perform\nreverberation mapping based on single band photometric data. Based on simulated\nlight curves generated using a damped random walk model of quasar variability,\nwe show that measurement of the size of the broad line region can be achieved\nusing this method, provided one spectrum has been obtained independently during\nthe monitoring. This method is complementary to photometric reverberation\nmapping and could also be extended to multi-band data. Because the effect\ndescribed above produces a variability pattern in difference light curves\nbetween pairs of lensed images which is correlated with the time-lagged\ncontinuum variability, it can potentially produce systematic errors in\nmeasurement of time delays between pairs of lensed images. Simple simulations\nindicate that time-delay measurement techniques which use a sufficiently\nflexible model for the extrinsic variability are not affected by this effect\nand produce accurate time delays. \n\n"}

Because\ncooling by neutrinos can be very efficient, NSs have been predicted to\naccumulate significant mass during CE events, perhaps enough to lead them to\ncollapse to black holes. We revisit this conclusion with the additional\nconsideration of CE structure, particularly density gradients across the\nembedded NS's accretion radius. This work is informed by our recent numerical\nsimulations that find that the presence of a density gradient strongly limits\naccretion by imposing a net angular momentum to the flow around the NS.

In the propagating oscillatory shock\nmodel, oscillation of the Compton cloud is thought to cause QPOs. Thus, in\norder to increase QPO frequency, Compton cloud must collapse steadily in the\nrising phase. In decline phases, exactly opposite should be true. We\ninvestigate cause of this evolution of the Compton cloud. The same viscosity\nparameter which increases the Keplerian disk rate, also moves the inner edge of\nthe Keplerian component, thereby reducing the size of the Compton cloud and\nreducing the cooling time scale. We show that cooling of the Compton cloud by\ninverse Comptonization is enough for it to collapse sufficiently so as to\nexplain the QPO evolution.

Thus, hadron-initiated showers\ndetected by both type of detectors are used to calibrate the energy estimator\nfrom the surface array (usually the interpolated signal at a certain distance\nfrom the shower core S(r0)) with the primary energy. On the other hand, this\ncalibration is not feasible when searching for photon primaries since no high\nenergy photon has been unambiguously detected so far. Therefore, pure Monte\nCarlo parametrizations are used instead.\n  In this work, we present a new method to determine the primary energy of\nhadron-induced showers in a hybrid experiment based on a technique previously\ndeveloped for photon primaries. It consists on a set of calibration curves that\nrelate the surface energy estimator, S(r0), and the depth of maximum\ndevelopment of the shower, Xmax, obtained from the fluorescence telescopes.\nThen, the primary energy can be determined from pure surface information since\nS(r0) and the zenith angle of the incoming shower are only needed.

In contrast to\nindirect dark matter searches using positrons, antiprotons, or gamma-rays,\nwhich suffer from relatively high and uncertain astrophysical backgrounds,\nsearches with antideuterons benefit from very suppressed conventional\nbackgrounds, offering a potential breakthrough in unexplored phase space for\ndark matter.

There are,\nhowever, still some unresolved issues with the underlying disk models. One of\nthem manifests as an apparent decrease in spin for increasing source\nluminosity. Here, we perform a few simple tests to establish whether outflows\nfrom the disk close to the inner radius can address this problem. We employ\nfour different parametric models to describe the wind and compare these to the\napparent decrease in spin with luminosity measured in the sources LMC~X-3 and\nGRS~1915+105. Wind models in which parameters do not explicitly depend on the\naccretion rate cannot reproduce the spin measurements.

Aside from\nheralding the onset of cosmic reionization, these first and second generation\nstars could have reasonably produced the ~5-20 solar-mass seeds that eventually\ngrew into z~6-7 quasars. But this process would have taken ~900 Myr, a timeline\nthat appears to be at odds with the predictions of LCDM without an anomalously\nhigh accretion rate, or some exotic creation of ~10^5 solar-mass seeds.

Time to detection of nanohertz gravitational waves\n  based on pulsar-timing array limits Abstract: Decade-long timing observations of arrays of millisecond pulsars have placed\nhighly constraining upper limits on the amplitude of the nanohertz\ngravitational-wave stochastic signal from the mergers of supermassive\nblack-hole binaries ($\\sim 10^{-15}$ strain at $f = 1/\\mathrm{yr}$). These\nlimits suggest that binary merger rates have been overestimated, or that\nenvironmental influences from nuclear gas or stars accelerate orbital decay,\nreducing the gravitational-wave signal at the lowest, most sensitive\nfrequencies. This prompts the question whether nanohertz gravitational waves\nare likely to be detected in the near future. In this letter, we answer this\nquestion quantitatively using simple statistical estimates, deriving the range\nof true signal amplitudes that are compatible with current upper limits, and\ncomputing expected detection probabilities as a function of observation time.\nWe conclude that small arrays consisting of the pulsars with the least timing\nnoise, which yield the tightest upper limits, have discouraging prospects of\nmaking a detection in the next two decades.

It is frequently argued that shocks\nare the main driver of the flaring events. However, the spectral variability\nmodelings generally lack detailed considerations of the self-consistent\nmagnetic field evolution modeling, thus so far the associated optical\npolarization signatures are poorly understood. We present the first\nsimultaneous modeling of the optical radiation and polarization signatures\nbased on 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations of relativistic shocks in the\nblazar emission environment, with the simplest physical assumptions. By\ncomparing the results with observations, we find that shocks in a weakly\nmagnetized environment will largely lead to significant changes in the optical\npolarization signatures, which are seldom seen in observations. Hence an\nemission region with relatively strong magnetization is preferred. In such an\nenvironment, slow shocks may produce minor flares with either erratic\npolarization fluctuations or considerable polarization variations, depending on\nthe parameters; fast shocks can produce major flares with smooth PA rotations.\nIn addition, the magnetic fields in both cases are observed to actively revert\nto the original topology after the shocks.

Previously\nnegligible effects may become important in the reconstruction of the PSF, in\npart because of the improved spatial resolution. In this paper, we show that\nunresolved multiple star systems can affect the ellipticity and size of the PSF\nand that this effect is not cancelled even when using many stars in the\nreconstruction process. We estimate the error in the reconstruction of the PSF\ndue to the binaries in the star sample both analytically and with image\nsimulations for different PSFs and stellar populations. The simulations support\nour analytical finding that the error on the size of the PSF is a function of\nthe multiple stars distribution and of the intrinsic value of the size of the\nPSF, i.e. if all stars were single. Similarly, the modification of each of the\ncomplex ellipticity components (e1,e2) depends on the distribution of multiple\nstars and on the intrinsic complex ellipticity.

We\nstudied the evolution of the 2003-2004 outbursts in soft X-rays using RXTE\n(2.5-12 keV; ASM), and in hard X-rays with INTEGRAL (17-80 keV, IBIS/ISGRI).\nUsing data from the JEM-X monitor onboard INTEGRAL we detected 61 Type-I X-ray\nbursts, and confirm that the source displayed a quasi-periodic burst recurrence\ntime of about 2.3 hours. We improve the characterization of the fuel\ncomposition, as well as the description of the typical burst durations and\nfluences. We estimate the average value of $\\alpha$ to be $49\\pm\\,3$.

The measured recurrence time in double bursts is too short\nto allow the accretion of enough fresh material, necessary to trigger a Type-I\nX-ray burst.

Stability of new fermion or scalar multiplets is\nensured by an accidental matter parity that survives the spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking of the gauge group by scalar triplets. The relic abundance of these\nparticles is set by gauge interactions and gives rise to dark matter candidates\nwith masses above the electroweak scale. Dark matter annihilations are thus\nmodified by the Sommerfeld effect, not only in the early Universe, but also\ntoday, for instance, in the Center of the Galaxy. Majorana candidates -\ntriplet, quintuplet, bi-doublet, and bi-triplet - bring only one new parameter\nto the model, their mass, and are hence highly testable at colliders and\nthrough astrophysical observations. Scalar candidates - doublet and 7-plet, the\nlatter being only stable at the renormalizable level - have additional\nscalar-scalar interactions that give rise to rich phenomenology.

Past surveys\nhave achieved photometric precision of 1-2% by calibrating the survey's stellar\nphotometry with repeated measurements of a large number of stars observed in\nmultiple epochs. The calibration techniques employed by these surveys only\nconsider the relative frame-by-frame photometric zeropoint offset and the focal\nplane position-dependent illumination corrections, which are independent of the\nsource color. However, variations in the wavelength dependence of the\natmospheric transmission and the instrumental throughput induce source\ncolor-dependent systematic errors. These systematic errors must also be\nconsidered to achieve the most precise photometric measurements. In this paper,\nwe examine such systematic chromatic errors using photometry from the Dark\nEnergy Survey (DES) as an example. We define a natural magnitude system for DES\nand calculate the systematic errors on stellar magnitudes, when the atmospheric\ntransmission and instrumental throughput deviate from the natural system.

Its prime scientific\ngoal is to measure the masses and radii of non-accreting neutron stars via fits\nto the energy-dependent waveforms produced by the rotation of hot spots on\ntheir surfaces. These measurements will provide valuable input to theoretical\nmodels of cold matter beyond nuclear density. Here we propose that PSR\nJ1614$-$2230, despite its low count rate, is a promising source to observe with\nNICER. The reason is that XMM-Newton observations suggest that the fractional\noscillation amplitude from PSR J1614$-$2230 could be high enough that this star\ncannot be very compact. We show that if we analyze 0.5 Ms of NICER data and 0.1\nMs of nearby off-source data and combine that analysis with the known mass of\nthis star, we would find a robust lower limit to the radius with a statistical\nuncertainty of only $\\sim 0.5-0.7$ km. We also show that even if there is an\nunmodeled nonthermal component modulated at the pulsation frequency, good\nstatistical fits could rule out significant biases. The low count rate will\nmake reliable upper limits on the radius difficult, but the lower limit could\nrule out some equations of state that are currently being discussed. This\nanalysis would require a good estimate of the non-source background, so Chandra\nobservations of the vicinity of PSR J1614$-$2230 would be helpful. \n\n"}

(ii) Second, we consider the fate of\nbursting emission in the nebulae. We suggest that an impulsive burst may lead\nto a highly relativistic flow, which would interact with the nebula. If the\nshocked nebula is still relativistic, pre-existing non-thermal particles in the\nnebula can be significantly boosted by the forward shock, leading to\nshort-duration (maybe millisecond or longer) high-energy gamma-ray flashes.\nPossible dissipation at the reverse shock may also lead to gamma-ray emission.\n(iii) After such flares, interactions with the baryonic ejecta may lead to\nafterglow emission with a duration of days to weeks.

A wide class\nof these theories, albeit indistinguishable from GR in the weak field regime,\npredicts a radically different phenomenology for neutron stars, due to a\nnonperturbative, strong-field effect referred to as spontaneous scalarization.\nThis effect is known to occur in theories where the effective linear coupling\n$\\beta_0$ between the scalar and matter fields is sufficiently negative, i.e.\n$\\beta_0 \\lesssim -4.35$, and has been strongly constrained by pulsar timing\nobservations.\n  In the test-field approximation, spontaneous scalarization manifests itself\nas a tachyonic-like instability. Recently, it was argued that, in theories\nwhere $\\beta_0>0$, a similar instability would be triggered by sufficiently\ncompact neutron stars obeying realistic equations of state. In this work we\ninvestigate the endstate of this instability for some representative coupling\nfunctions with $\\beta_0>0$.

The observed\nhigh-energy electromagnetic radiation (above 50 keV) originated from a weak\ntransient source and lasted for about 1 second. Its localization is consistent\nwith the direction to GW150914. We speculate about the possible scenario for\nthe formation of a gamma-ray burst accompanied by the gravitational-wave\nsignal. Our model invokes a tight binary system consisting of a massive star\nand a black hole which leads to the triggering of a collapse of the star's\nnucleus, the formation of a second black hole, and finally to the binary black\nhole merger. For the most-likely configuration of the binary spin vectors with\nrespect to the orbital angular momentum in the GW150914 event, the recoil speed\n(kick velocity) acquired by the final black hole through gravitational wave\nemission is of the order of a few hundred km/s and this might be sufficient to\nget it closer to the envelope of surrounding material and capture a small\nfraction of matter from the remnant of the host star. The gamma-ray burst is\nproduced by the accretion of this remnant matter onto the final black hole. The\nmoderate spin of the final black hole suggests that the gamma-ray burst jet is\npowered by weak neutrino emission rather than the Blandford-Znajek mechanism,\nand hence explains the low power available for the observed GRB signal. \n\n"}

Recent galaxy formation simulations\nhave demonstrated the need for active CR transport either in the form of\ndiffusion or streaming to successfully launch winds in galaxies. However, due\nto computational limitations, most previous simulations have modeled CR\ntransport isotropically. Here, we discuss high resolution simulations of\nisolated disk galaxies in a $10^{11}\\rm{M_\\odot}$ halo with the moving mesh\ncode {\\sc Arepo} that include injection of CRs from supernovae, advective\ntransport, CR cooling, and CR transport through isotropic or anisotropic\ndiffusion. We show that either mode of diffusion leads to the formation of\nstrong bipolar outflows. However, they develop significantly later in the\nsimulation with anisotropic diffusion compared to the simulation with isotropic\ndiffusion. Moreover, we find that isotropic diffusion allows most of the CRs to\nquickly diffuse out of the disk, while in the simulation with anisotropic\ndiffusion, most CRs remain in the disk once the magnetic field becomes\ndominated by its azimuthal component, which occurs after $\\sim 300\\,{\\rm\nMyrs}$. This has important consequences for the gas dynamics in the disk. In\nparticular, we show that isotropic diffusion strongly suppresses the\namplification of the magnetic field in the disk compared to anisotropic or no\ndiffusion models. We therefore conclude that reliable simulations which include\nCR transport inevitably need to account for anisotropic diffusion. \n\n"}

To reach this\nperformance requires an accurate and robust data analysis method, especially\nsince the possible WEP violation signal will be dominated by a strongly colored\nnoise. An important complication is brought by the fact that some values will\nbe missing -therefore, the measured time series will not be strictly regularly\nsampled. Those missing values induce a spectral leakage that significantly\nincreases the noise in Fourier space, where the WEP violation signal is looked\nfor, thereby complicating scientific returns. Recently, we developed an\ninpainting algorithm to correct the MICROSCOPE data for missing values. This\ncode has been integrated in the official MICROSCOPE data processing pipeline\nbecause it enables us to significantly measure an equivalence principle\nviolation (EPV) signal in a model-independent way, in the inertial satellite\nconfiguration. In this work, we present several improvements to the method that\nmay allow us now to reach the MICROSCOPE requirements for both inertial and\nspin satellite configurations.

In recent years, high-quality X-ray observations\nhave allowed for detailed measurements of the Fe K$\\alpha$ emission line, where\nrelativistic line broadening allows constraints on the spin parameter (the\nX-ray reflection method). Another technique uses accretion disk models to fit\nthe AGN continuum emission (the continuum-fitting, or CF, method). Although\neach technique has model-dependent uncertainties, these are the best empirical\ntools currently available and should be vetted in systems where both techniques\ncan be applied. A detailed comparison of the two methods is also useful because\nneither method can be applied to all AGN. The X-ray reflection technique\ntargets mostly local (z $\\lesssim$ 0.1) systems, while the CF method can be\napplied at higher redshift, up to and beyond the peak of AGN activity and\ngrowth.

We predicted the one-to-one\ncorrespondence between the tilt of the linear polarization position angle of\nthe and the circular polarization. However, some of the radio pulsars indicate\na clear deviation from that correlation. In this paper we apply the theory of\nthe radio wave propagation in the pulsar magnetosphere for the analysis of\nindividual effects leading to these deviations. We show that within our theory\nthe circular polarization of a given mode can switch its sign, without the need\nto introduce a new radiation mode or other effects. Moreover, we show that the\ngeneration of different emission modes on different altitudes can explain\npulsars, that presumably have the X-O-X light-curve pattern, different from\nwhat we predict. General properties of radio emission within our propagation\ntheory are also discussed. In particular, we calculate the intensity patterns\nfor different radiation altitudes and present light curves for different\nobserver viewing angles. In this context we also study the light curves and\npolarization profiles for pulsars with interpulses.

Another important feature of radio polarization\nprofiles is the shift of the position angle from the center, which in some\ncases demonstrates a weak dependence on the observation frequency.

The challenging requirement is that the resonance has twice the\ndark matter mass to one part in a million.

The linear growth rate continues to rise until the sizes of plasmoids\nbecome comparable to the inner layer width of the tearing mode.

Abstract: This year marks the thirtieth anniversary of the only supernova from which we\nhave detected neutrinos - SN 1987A. The twenty or so neutrinos that were\ndetected were mined to great depth in order to determine the events that\noccurred in the explosion and to place limits upon all manner of neutrino\nproperties. Since 1987 the scale and sensitivity of the detectors capable of\nidentifying neutrinos from a Galactic supernova have grown considerably so that\ncurrent generation detectors are capable of detecting of order ten thousand\nneutrinos for a supernova at the Galactic Center. Next generation detectors\nwill increase that yield by another order of magnitude. Simultaneous with the\ngrowth of neutrino detection capability, our understanding of how massive stars\nexplode and how the neutrino interacts with hot and dense matter has also\nincreased by a tremendous degree. The neutrino signal will contain much\ninformation on all manner of physics of interest to a wide community.

Spinning with\nperiods as short as a few milliseconds, their stability can supersede that of\nthe best atomic clocks on Earth over timescales of a few years. Stable clocks\nare synonymous with precise measurements, which is why pulsars play a role of\nparamount importance in testing fundamental physics. As a pulsar rotates, the\nradio beam emitted along its magnetic axis appears to us as pulses because of\nthe lighthouse effect. Thanks to the extreme regularity of the emitted pulses,\nminuscule disturbances leave particular fingerprints in the times-of-arrival\n(TOAs) measured on Earth with the technique of pulsar timing. Tiny deviations\nfrom the expected TOAs, predicted according to a theoretical timing model based\non known physics, can therefore reveal a plethora of interesting new physical\neffects. Pulsar timing can be used to measure the dynamics of pulsars in\ncompact binaries, thus probing the post-Newtonian expansion of general\nrelativity beyond the weak field regime, while offering unique possibilities of\nconstraining alternative theories of gravity. Additionally, the correlation of\nTOAs from an ensemble of millisecond pulsars can be exploited to detect\nlow-frequency gravitational waves of astrophysical and cosmological origins. We\npresent a comprehensive review of the many applications of pulsar timing as a\nprobe of gravity, describing in detail the general principles, current\napplications and results, as well as future prospects. \n\n"}

There is also growing evidence that disk winds drive accretion in such\ndisks. We show through 2D (axisymmetric) simulations that rings and gaps\ndevelop naturally in magnetically coupled disk-wind systems on the scale of\ntens of au, where ambipolar diffusion (AD) is the dominant non-ideal MHD\neffect. In simulations where the magnetic field and matter are moderately\ncoupled, the disk remains relatively laminar with the radial electric current\nsteepened by AD into a thin layer near the midplane. The toroidal magnetic\nfield sharply reverses polarity in this layer, generating a large magnetic\ntorque that drives fast accretion, which drags the poloidal field into a highly\npinched radial configuration. The reconnection of this pinched field creates\nmagnetic loops where the net poloidal magnetic flux (and thus the accretion\nrate) is reduced, yielding dense rings. Neighbouring regions with stronger\npoloidal magnetic fields accrete faster, forming gaps. In better magnetically\ncoupled simulations, the so-called `avalanche accretion streams' develop\ncontinuously near the disk surface, rendering the disk-wind system more\nchaotic. Nevertheless, prominent rings and gaps are still produced, at least in\npart, by reconnection, which again enables the segregation of the poloidal\nfield and the disk material similar to the more diffusive disks. However, the\nreconnection is now driven by the non-linear growth of MRI channel flows. The\nformation of rings and gaps in rapidly accreting yet laminar disks has\ninteresting implications for dust settling and trapping, grain growth, and\nplanet formation. \n\n"}

Yet, nobody has ever seen a black\nhole. What do they look like? Initially, this question seemed more of an\nacademic nature. However, this has changed over the past two decades.\nObservations and theoretical considerations suggest that the supermassive black\nhole, Sgr A*, in the center of our Milky Way is surrounded by a compact, foggy\nemission region radiating at and above 230 GHz. It has been predicted that the\nevent horizon of Sgr A* should cast its shadow onto that emission region, which\ncould be detectable with a global VLBI array of radio telescopes.

The duration of prompt gamma-ray pulses is rather constant while the\nwidth of X-ray flares correlates with their peak time suggesting a possible\ndifferent origin. However, pulses and flares have similar spectral properties.\nConsidering internal and external shock scenarios, we derive how the energy and\nduration of pulses scale with their time of occurrence and we compare with\nobservations. The absence of an observed correlation between prompt emission\npulse duration and its time of occurrence favours an \"internal\" origin and\nconfirms the earlier results of Ramirez-Ruiz & Fenimore.

If not properly characterized,\nthey could limit the ability of next-generation experiments to remove\nastrophysical foreground contamination. Uncertainties include the instrument\ndetector band, which could systematically change across the focal plane, as\nwell as the calibration of the instrument used to measure the bands. A\npotentially major effect is time-dependent gain and band uncertainties caused\nby atmospheric fluctuations. More specifically, changes in atmospheric\nconditions lead to frequency-dependent changes in the atmospheric transmission\nwhich, in turn, leads to variations in the effective gain and central frequency\nof the instrument's bandpass. Using atmospheric modeling software and ACTPol\nbandpasses, we simulate the expected variations in band gain and central\nfrequency for 20, 40, 90, 150, and 240 GHz bands as a function of precipitable\nwater vapor, observing angle, and ground temperature.

The effects of an X-ray flare, which suddenly increases\nthe X-ray flux by $10^5 \\times$ are then studied. A cloud exposed to a bright\nflare has 99% of its CO destroyed in 10-20 years, whereas it takes $>10^3$\nyears for 99% of the H$_2$ to be destroyed.

These\nasymmetries arise because of the different paths traveled by particles in the\nupper and lower sides of the plane perpendicular to the shower axis to reach\ndetectors at the same axial distances. The shower particles are differentially\nattenuated as they traverse the atmosphere. Furthermore, most particles are not\npropagating strictly in the shower direction but are on average going away from\nthe axis. This geometrical projection effect also contributes to the final\nasymmetry. These novel observations must be understood for parameterisation of\nthe lateral distribution function. Additionally, the asymmetry in time\ndistributions offers a new possibility for the determination of the mass\ncomposition because its magnitude is strongly dependent on the fraction of\nelectromagnetic signal at the observation level. The asymmetries found in data\ncollected from the Engineering Array of the Auger Observatory will be compared\nwith Monte Carlo data. \n\n"}

The\ntime distributions sampled at different positions at ground level by a large\nair shower array are converted into distributions of production distances using\nan approximate relation between production distance, transverse distance and\ntime delay. The method is naturally restricted to inclined showers where muons\ndominate the signal at ground level but could be extended to vertical showers\nprovided that the detectors used can separate the muon signal from electrons\nand photons. We explore the accuracy and practical uncertainties involved in\nthe proposed method. For practical purposes only the muons that fall outside\nthe central region of the shower can be used, and we establish cuts in\ntransverse distance. The method is tested using simulated showers by comparing\nthe production distance distributions obtained using the method with the actual\ndistances in the simulated showers. It could be applied in the search of\nneutrinos to increase the acceptance to highly penetrating particles, as well\nas for unraveling the relative compositions of protons and heavy nuclei. We\nalso illustrate that the obtained depth distributions have minimum width when\nboth the arrival direction and the core position are well reconstructed. \n\n"}

This\nreport gives a review of the physics and astrophysics associated with the\nquestions of origin and propagation of these Extremely High Energy (EHE) cosmic\nrays in the Universe. After a brief review of the observed cosmic rays in\ngeneral and their possible sources and acceleration mechanisms, a detailed\ndiscussion is given of possible \"top-down\" (non-acceleration) scenarios of\norigin of EHE cosmic rays through decay of sufficiently massive particles\noriginating from processes in the early Universe.
