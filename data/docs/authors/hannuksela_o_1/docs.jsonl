The interaction of\nvery-high-energy (VHE: E>100 GeV) gamma-rays, emitted by sources located at\ncosmological distances, with the intervening EBL results in electron-positron\npair production that leads to energy-dependent attenuation of the observed VHE\nflux.

In this paper we propose a method\nto measure the EBL photon number density. It relies on using simultaneous\nobservations of blazars in the optical, X-ray, high-energy (HE: E>100 MeV)\ngamma-ray (from the Fermi telescope), and VHE gamma-ray (from Cherenkov\ntelescopes) bands.

If we can consider the entanglement entropy as thermodynamic entropy, we\ncan see the entropic force acting on the two black holes from the $r$\ndependence of $S_C$. We develop the computational method based on that of\nBombelli et al to obtain the $r$ dependence of $S_C$ of scalar fields whose\nLagrangian is quadratic with respect to the scalar fields. First we study $S_C$\nin $d+1$ dimensional Minkowski spacetime. In this case the state of the\nmassless free scalar field is the Minkowski vacuum state and we replace two\nblack holes by two imaginary spheres, and we take the trace over the degrees of\nfreedom residing in the imaginary spheres. We obtain the leading term of $S_C$\nwith respect to $1/r$.

We do not calculate\n$G(R_1,R_2)$ in detail, but we show how to calculate it. In the black hole case\nwe use the method used in the Minkowski spacetime case with some modifications.\nWe show that $S_C$ can be expected to be the same form as that in the Minkowski\nspacetime case. But in the black hole case, $S_A$ and $S_B$ depend on $r$, so\nwe do not fully obtain the $r$ dependence of $S_C$. Finally we assume that the\nentanglement entropy can be regarded as thermodynamic entropy, and consider the\nentropic force acting on two black holes. We argue how to separate the\nentanglement entropic force from other force and how to cancel $S_A$ and $S_B$\nwhose $r$ dependence are not obtained.

We first introduce a radiation-reaction potential into this method,\nand we show that it leads to a self-consistent set of equations that describe\nthe simultaneous evolution of the waveform and of the timelike matching\nsurface.

In order to confirm the Kerr-nature of these\nobjects, we need to probe the geometry of the space-time around them and see if\nthe observations are consistent with the predictions of the Kerr metric. That\ncan be achieved, for instance, by studying the properties of the\nelectromagnetic radiation emitted by the gas in the accretion disk. The\nhigh-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations observed in the X-ray flux of some\nstellar-mass black hole candidates might do the job. As the frequencies of\nthese oscillations depend only very weakly on the observed X-ray flux, it is\nthought they are mainly determined by the metric of the space-time. In this\npaper, I consider the resonance models proposed by Abramowicz and Kluzniak and\nI extend previous results to the case of non-Kerr space-times. The emerging\npicture is more complicated than the one around a Kerr black hole and there is\na larger number of possible combinations between different modes. I then\ncompare the bounds inferred from the twin peak high-frequency quasi-periodic\noscillations observed in three micro-quasars (GRO J1655-40, XTE J1550-564, and\nGRS 1915+105) with the measurements from the continuum-fitting method of the\nsame objects.

Recently, the $f(T)$ gravity has been invoked as an\nalternative approach for explaining the observed acceleration expansion of the\nUniverse. If gravity is described by a $f(T)$ theory instead of general\nrelativity, there are a number of issues that ought to be reexamined in the\nframework of $f(T)$ theories. In this work, to proceed further with the current\ninvestigation of the limits and potentialities of the $f(T)$ gravity theories,\nwe derive and discuss the bounds imposed by the energy conditions on a general\n$f(T)$ functional form.

The majority of such mergers\nfall into the mass ratio range of 1:30 to 1:3, implying a spin flip during the\ninspiral.

This\nformula approximates well more cumbersome expressions obtained from the fit\nwith numerical simulations. By integrating over all equally likely orientations\nfor precessing mergers we determine a lower approximant to the final spin\ndistribution as function of the mass ratio alone.

One approach works directly with the time domain data, and\nthe other works with a specially constructed Fourier transform of the data. The\nraw data was run through TEMPO2 to produce reduced timing residuals for the\nanalysis.

The situation however changed dramatically in the\npresence of magnetic field produced by the accretion disk surrounding the hole\nin the equatorial plane. In 1985, Wagh, Dhurandhar and Dadhich had for the\nfirst time considered the magnetic Penrose process (MPP) in which the magnetic\nfield could now provide the energy required for a fragment to ride on negative\nenergy orbit thereby overcoming the stringent velocity constraint of the\noriginal PP. Thus MPP turned very efficient and so much so that efficiency\ncould now even exceed 100 percent. They had in principle established revival of\nPP for astrophysical applications in powering the high energy sources. MPP is\nhowever similar to the earlier discovered and well known Blandford-Znajeck (BZ)\nmechanism in which the rotational energy of the hole is extracted out through a\npurely electromagnetic process. Though both the processes use magnetic field as\na device to extract rotational energy from the hole, yet their kernel is quite\ndifferent in spirit. For the former magnetic field provides the threshold\nenergy for particle to get onto negative energy orbit so that the other\nfragment goes out with enhanced energy while for the latter it generates an\nelectric potential difference between the equatorial plane and the polar\nregion, and it is the discharge of which that drives the energy flux out of the\nhole.

However, the standard EFT formalism, to lowest order in spacetime\ndifferential operators, does not provide the most general parametrization of a\ntheory that remains weakly coupled throughout the entire low-energy regime.\nHere we study the EFT formulation by including spacetime differential operators\nimplying a scale dependence of the Goldstone boson self-interactions and its\ndispersion relation.

Abstract: The lightcurve of the explosion of a star with a radius <10-100Rsun is\npowered mostly by radioactive decay. Observationally such events are dominated\nby hydrogen deficient progenitors and classified as Type I supernovae: white\ndwarf thermonuclear explosions (Type Ia) and core collapses of\nhydrogen-stripped massive stars (Type Ibc). Transient surveys are finding SNe I\nin increasing numbers and at earlier times, allowing their early emission to be\nstudied in unprecedented detail. Motivated by these developments, we summarize\nthe physics that produces their rising lightcurves and discuss how observations\ncan be utilized to study these exploding stars. The early radioactive-powered\nlightcurves probe the shallowest 56Ni deposits. If the amount of 56Ni mixing\ncan be deduced, then it places constraints on the progenitor and properties of\nthe explosive burning. In practice we find it is difficult to disentangle\nwhether the explosion occurred recently and one is seeing 56Ni heating near the\nsurface or whether the explosion began in the past and 56Ni heating is deeper.\nIn the latter case there is a \"dark phase\" between the moment of explosion and\nthe first light observed from the shallowest layers of 56Ni. Because of this,\nsimply extrapolating a lightcurve from 56Ni back in time is not a reliable\nmethod for estimating the explosion time. The best solution is to directly\nidentify the moment of explosion, by either observing shock breakout or\nshock-heated surface cooling, so the depth being probed by the rising\nlightcurve is known. Since this is typically not available, we identify other\ndiagnostics that are helpful for deciphering how recently an explosion\noccurred. As an example we apply these arguments to the SN Ic PTF 10vgv. We\ndemonstrate that just a single measurement of the photospheric velocity and\ntemperature during the rise places constraints on its explosion time, radius,\nand 56Ni mixing. \n\n"}

The scenario takes\ninto account the interaction between superfluid inertial modes and the normal\n(quadrupole) $m=2$ $r$-mode, which can be driven unstable by\nChandrasekhar-Friedman-Schutz (CFS) mechanism. This interaction can only occur\nat some fixed \"resonance\" stellar temperatures; it leads to formation of the\n\"stability peaks\" which stabilize a star in the vicinity of these temperatures.\nWe demonstrate that a NS in LMXB spends a substantial fraction of time on the\nstability peak, that is, in the region of stellar temperatures and spin\nfrequencies, that has been previously thought to be CFS unstable with respect\nto excitation of $r$-modes. We also find that the spin frequencies of NSs are\nlimited by the CFS instability of normal (octupole) $m=3$ $r$-mode rather than\nby $m=2$ $r$-mode.

Pion decay via\nproton-proton collisions is a possible mechanism to supply a secondary positron\npopulation with a low energy limit.

Abstract: Starting from the Oppenheimer-Snyder model, we know how in classical general\nrelativity the gravitational collapse of matter form a black hole with a\ncentral spacetime singularity. It is widely believed that the singularity must\nbe removed by quantum gravity effects. Some static quantum-inspired\nsingularity-free black hole solutions have been proposed in the literature, but\nwhen one considers simple examples of gravitational collapse the classical\nsingularity is replaced by a bounce, after which the collapsing matter expands\nfor ever. We may expect 3 possible explanations: $i)$ the static regular black\nhole solutions are not physical, in the sense that they cannot be realized in\nNature, $ii)$ the final product of the collapse is not unique, but it depends\non the initial conditions, or $iii)$ boundary effects play an important role\nand our simple models miss important physics.

Here we present a wide survey of the\ncorrections due to these effects in two situations of great interest for GW\nastronomy: the black hole (BH) ringdown emission and the inspiral of two\ncompact objects. We take into account various effects such as: electric\ncharges, magnetic fields, cosmological evolution, possible deviations from\nGeneral Relativity, firewalls, and various forms of matter such as accretion\ndisks and dark matter halos. Our analysis predicts the existence of resonances\ndictated by the external mass distribution, which dominate the very late-time\nbehavior of merger/ringdown waveforms. The mode structure can drastically\ndiffer from the vacuum case, yet the BH response to external perturbations is\nunchanged at the time scales relevant for detectors. This is because although\nthe vacuum Schwarzschild resonances are no longer quasinormal modes of the\nsystem, they still dominate the response at intermediate times.

Its dominant frequency content\nis tightly correlated with the radius of the neutron star, and its measurement\ncan be used to constrain the supranuclear equation of state. In contrast, the\nmerger of higher mass systems results in prompt gravitational collapse to a\nblack hole. We have developed an algorithm which combines waveform\nreconstruction from a morphology-independent search for gravitational wave\ntransients with Bayesian model selection, to discriminate between post-merger\nscenarios and accurately measure the dominant oscillation frequency. We\ndemonstrate the efficacy of the method using a catalogue of simulated binary\nmerger signals in data from LIGO and Virgo, and we discuss the prospects for\nthis analysis in advanced ground-based gravitational wave detectors. From the\nwaveforms considered in this work and assuming an optimally oriented source, we\nfind that the post-merger neutron star signal may be detectable by this\ntechnique to $\\sim 10\\text{--}25$\\,Mpc.

The physical mechanism responsible for the development of these\nexponentially growing instabilities is the superradiant amplification of\nbosonic fields confined between the black hole and the mirror. A remarkable\nfeature of this composed black-hole-mirror-field system is the existence of a\ncritical mirror radius, $r^{\\text{stat}}_{\\text{m}}$, which supports {\\it\nstationary} (marginally-stable) field configurations. This critical\n(`stationary') mirror radius marks the boundary between stable and unstable\nblack-hole-mirror-field configurations: composed systems whose confining mirror\nis situated in the region $r_{\\text{m}}<r^{\\text{stat}}_{\\text{m}}$ are stable\n(that is, all modes of the confined field decay in time), whereas composed\nsystems whose confining mirror is situated in the region\n$r_{\\text{m}}>r^{\\text{stat}}_{\\text{m}}$ are unstable (that is, there are\nconfined field modes which grow exponentially over time).

Many of these rapidly rotating pulsars are in orbit with\nanother star, allowing pulsar timing to probe relativistic perturbations to the\norbital motion. Pulsars have provided the most stringent tests of theories of\nrelativistic gravitation, especially in the strong-field regime, and have shown\nthat Einstein's general theory of relativity is an accurate description of the\nobserved motions. Many other gravitational theories are effectively ruled out\nor at least severely constrained by these results. MSPs can also be used to\nform a \"Pulsar Timing Array\" (PTA).

The\nBogolyubov modes of the condensate are mapped onto the Goldstone modes of the\nsigma model, which become gapless at the critical point. These gapless\nGoldstone modes are the quantum carriers of information and entropy.

In one, the\ndominant contribution comes from highly irregular, in the other from highly\nregular configurations, both describing flat Euclidean space with small quantum\nfluctuations around them, viewed in different coordinate systems.

For energy densities\nhigher than the new mass scale of the theory, a gravitating dust component is\nshown to generically induce an accelerated expansion of the Universe. Within\nsuch a simple scenario, inflation gracefully exits when the GR regime is\nrecovered, but the Universe would remain matter dominated. In order to\nimplement a reheating era after inflation, we then consider inflation to be\ndriven by a mixture of unstable dust species decaying into radiation. Because\nthe speed of sound gravitates within the Born-Infeld model under consideration,\nour scenario ends up being predictive on various open questions of the\ninflationary paradigm. The total number of e-folds of acceleration is given by\nthe lifetime of the unstable dust components and is related to the duration of\nreheating. As a result, inflation does not last much longer than the number of\ne-folds of deceleration allowing a small spatial curvature and large scale\ndeviations to isotropy to be observable today. Energy densities are\nself-regulated as inflation can only start for a total energy density less than\na threshold value, again related to the species' lifetime. Above this\nthreshold, the Universe may bounce thereby avoiding a singularity. Another\ndistinctive feature is that the accelerated expansion is of the\nsuperinflationary kind, namely the first Hubble flow function is negative.

These effects are important, for instance, for\nlarge mass accretion rates when the disc approaches its local Eddington limit.\nIn this work, we study the upper limits for standard accretion disc\napproximation and find the corrections to the standard model that should be\nconsidered in any model aiming on reproducing the transition to super-Eddington\naccretion regime. First, we find that for thin accretion disc, taking into\naccount relativistic corrections allows to increase the local Eddington limit\nby about a factor of two due to stronger gravity in General Relativity (GR).\nHowever, violation of the local Eddington limit also means large disc\nthickness. To consider consequently the disc thickness effects, one should make\nassumptions upon the two-dimensional rotation law of the disc.

Such solutions are often difficult to find in\nbeyond-general-relativity theories due to the inclusion of additional fields\nthat couple to the metric non-linearly and non-minimally.

We build a full spectral-timing reprocessing\nmodel to simulate the UV/optical lightcurves of NGC 5548.

Supressing the\nfast variability requires an intervening structure preventing the hard X-rays\nfrom illuminating the disc. We propose this is the disc itself, perhaps due to\natomic processes in the UV lifting the photosphere, increasing the\nscale-height, making it less dense and less able to thermalise, so that it\nradiates low temperature Comptonised emission as required to produce the soft\nX-ray excess. The outer edge of the puffed-up Comptonised disc region emits FUV\nflux, and can illuminate the outer thin blackbody disc but while this gives\nreprocessed variable emission which is much closer to the observed UV and\noptical lightcurves, the light travel lags are still too short to match the\ndata.

These events with visual peak\nmagnitudes $\\lesssim-21$ are called superluminous SNe (SLSNe). Aims: There are\na few intermediate events which have luminosities between these two classes.\nHere we study one such object, SN 2012aa. Methods: The optical photometric and\nspectroscopic follow-up observations of the event were conducted over a time\nspan of about 120 days. Results: With V_abs at peak ~-20 mag, the SN is an\nintermediate-luminosity transient between regular SNe Ibc and SLSNe. It also\nexhibits an unusual secondary bump after the maximum in its light curve. We\ninterpret this as a manifestation of SN-shock interaction with the CSM. If we\nwould assume a $^{56}$Ni-powered ejecta, the bolometric light curve requires\nroughly 1.3 M_sun of $^{56}$Ni and an ejected mass of ~14 M_sun. This would\nalso imply a high kinetic energy of the explosion, ~5.4$\\times10^{51}$ ergs. On\nthe other hand, the unusually broad light curve along with the secondary peak\nindicate the possibility of interaction with CSM. The third alternative is the\npresence of a central engine releasing spin energy that eventually powers the\nlight curve over a long time. The host of the SN is a star-forming Sa/Sb/Sbc\ngalaxy. Conclusions: Although the spectral properties and velocity evolution of\nSN 2012aa are comparable to those of normal SNe Ibc, its broad light curve\nalong with a large peak luminosity distinguish it from canonical CCSNe,\nsuggesting the event to be an intermediate-luminosity transient between CCSNe\nand SLSNe at least in terms of peak luminosity. We argue that SN 2012aa belongs\nto a subclass where CSM interaction plays a significant role in powering the\nSN, at least during the initial stages of evolution. \n\n"}

In this context, even the\nunlikely idea that astrophysical black holes may have significant charge is\nworth exploring, and here we present results from the simulation of weakly\ncharged black holes as they orbit and merge. Our simulations suggest that a\nblack hole binary with mass comparable to that observed in GW150914 could\nproduce the level of electromagnetic luminosity observed by Fermi GBM\n($10^{49}$ ergs/s) with a non-dimensional charge of $q \\equiv Q/M = 10^{-4}$\nassuming good radiative efficiency.

The extreme sensitivity required to make such detections is\nachieved through exquisite isolation of all sensitive components of LIGO from\nnon-gravitational-wave disturbances. Nonetheless, LIGO is still susceptible to\na variety of instrumental and environmental sources of noise that contaminate\nthe data. Of particular concern are noise features known as glitches, which are\ntransient and non-Gaussian in their nature, and occur at a high enough rate so\nthat accidental coincidence between the two LIGO detectors is non-negligible.\nIn this paper we describe an innovative project that combines crowdsourcing\nwith machine learning to aid in the challenging task of categorizing all of the\nglitches recorded by the LIGO detectors. Through the Zooniverse platform, we\nengage and recruit volunteers from the public to categorize images of glitches\ninto pre-identified morphological classes and to discover new classes that\nappear as the detectors evolve.

Here, we propose a simple method for\nanswering the following question: Does the BH interior exist and, if so, does\nit contain some distribution of matter or is it mostly empty? Our proposal is\npremised on the idea that, similar to the case of relativistic, ultra-compact\nstars, any BH-like object whose interior has some matter distribution should\nsupport fluid modes in addition to the conventional spacetime modes. In\nparticular, the Coriolis-induced Rossby (r-) modes, whose spectrum is mostly\ninsensitive to the composition of the interior matter, should be a universal\nfeature of such BH-like objects. In fact, the frequency and damping time of\nthese modes are determined by only the object's mass and speed of rotation. The\nr-modes oscillate at a lower frequency, decay at a slower rate and produce\nweaker GWs than do modes of the spacetime class. Hence, they imprint a\nmodel-insensitive signature of a non-empty interior in the GW spectrum\nresulting from a BH merger. We find that future GW detectors, such as Advanced\nLIGO with its design sensitivity, have the potential of detecting such r-modes\nif the amount of GWs leaking out quantum mechanically from the interior of a\nBH-like object is sufficiently large. \n\n"}

Because the Alfv\\'en speed\nvaries with distance from the disk, the AWs undergo partial non-WKB reflection,\nand counter-propagating AWs subsequently interact, causing AW energy to cascade\nto small scales and dissipate. To investigate this process, we introduce an\nElsasser-like formulation of general relativistic MHD (GRMHD) and develop the\ntheory of general relativistic reduced MHD in an inhomogeneous medium. We then\nderive a set of equations for the mean-square AW amplitude $M_+$ and turbulent\nheating rate $Q$ under the assumption that, in the plasma rest frame, AWs\npropagating away from the disk are much more energetic than AWs propagating\ntoward the disk. For the case in which the background flow is axisymmetric and\ntime-independent, we solve these equations analytically to determine $M_+$ and\n$Q$ as functions of position.

Fortunately for current advanced detectors, there is a sizeable\ngap between the quantum-limited sensitivity and the classical noise at high\nfrequencies. Here we propose a detector design that closes such a gap by\nreducing the high-frequency quantum noise with an active optomechanical filter,\nfrequency-dependent squeezing, and high optical power.

We have studied the orbital and spin evolution of\nbinary BHs in triple systems, where the tertiary companion excites large\neccentricity in the inner binary through Lidov-Kozai oscillations, causing the\nbinary to merge via gravitational radiation. Using the single-orbital-averaged\nand double-orbital-averaged secular dynamics equations of triples, we determine\nthe merger window (the range of companion inclinations that allows the inner\nbinary to merge) and the merger fraction as a function of various system\nparameters. For typical BH binaries, the merger fraction increases rapidly with\nthe perturber eccentricity $e_{\\rm out}$ because of the octupole perturbation,\nreaching $10-20\\%$ at $e_{\\rm out}=0.9$. We derive the analytical expressions\nfor the merger window and merger fraction for systems with negligible octupole\neffect, and apply them to neutron star binary mergers in triples. We also\nfollow the spin evolution of the BHs during the companion-induced orbital\ndecay. Starting from aligned spin axes, a wide range of final spin-orbit\nmisalignment angle $\\theta_{\\rm sl}^{\\rm f}$ can be generated when the binary\nenters the LIGO band.

The 'luminosity' is known\nto be related to a clear physical quantity -- the amount of $^{56}$Ni\nsynthesized, but the 'width' has not been quantitatively linked yet to a\nphysical time scale.

Tremendous effort has been\ndedicated over the past decades to measure $H_0$. Notably, Planck cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB) and the local Cepheid-supernovae distance ladder\nmeasurements determine $H_0$ with a precision of $\\sim 1\\%$ and $\\sim 2\\%$\nrespectively. A $3$-$\\sigma$ level of discrepancy exists between the two\nmeasurements, for reasons that have yet to be understood. Gravitational wave\n(GW) sources accompanied by electromagnetic (EM) counterparts offer a\ncompletely independent standard siren (the GW analogue of an astronomical\nstandard candle) measurement of $H_0$, as demonstrated following the discovery\nof the neutron star merger, GW170817. This measurement does not assume a\ncosmological model and is independent of a cosmic distance ladder. The first\njoint analysis of the GW signal from GW170817 and its EM localization led to a\nmeasurement of $H_0=74^{+16}_{-8}$ km/s/Mpc (median and symmetric $68\\%$\ncredible interval). In this analysis, the degeneracy in the GW signal between\nthe source distance and the weakly constrained viewing angle dominated the\n$H_0$ measurement uncertainty. Recently, Mooley et al.

Here we obtain a significantly improved\nmeasurement $H_0=68.9^{+4.7}_{-4.6}$ km/s/Mpc by using these new radio\nobservations, combined with the previous GW and EM data. We estimate that 15\nmore localized GW170817-like events (comparable signal-to-noise ratio,\nfavorable orientation), having radio images and light curve data, will\npotentially bring resolution to the tension between the Planck and\nCepheid-supernova measurements, as compared to 50-100 GW events without such\ndata. \n\n"}

A\nparameter which is common to and plays a key role in both the GW and the EM\nanalyses is the viewing angle of the binary's orbit. If a binary is viewed from\ndifferent angles, the amount of GW energy changes (implying that orientation\nand distance are correlated) and the EM signatures can vary, depending on the\nstructure of the emission. Information about the viewing angle of the binary\norbital plane is therefore crucial to the interpretation of both the GW and the\nEM data, and can potentially be extracted from either side.\n  In the first part of this study, we present a systematic analysis of how well\nthe viewing angle of binary neutron stars can be measured from the GW data. We\nshow that if the sky position and the redshift of the binary can be identified\nvia the EM counterpart and an associated host galaxy, then for 50$\\%$ of the\nsystems the viewing angle can be constrained to $\\leq 7^{\\circ}$ uncertainty\nfrom the GW data, independent of electromagnetic emission models.

If,\nhowever, a strong phase transition exists between the central densities of the\ntwo stars, so that the more massive star has a phase transition and the least\nmassive star does not, this correlation will be weakened.

In order to make the best use of gravitational wave data from mergers,\nit is important to include the correlations relating the Lambdas and the masses\nas well as lower limits to the Lambdas as a function of mass. Focusing on the\ncase without strong phase transitions, and for mergers where the chirp mass\nM_chirp<1.4M_sun, which is the case for all observed double neutron star\nsystems where a total mass has been accurately measured, we show that the\ndimensionless Lambdas satisfy Lambda_1/Lambda_2= q^6, where q=M_2/M_1 is the\nbinary mass ratio; $M$ is mass of each star, respectively.

These black hole hairs could originate from the superradiant\ngrowth of a light axion field around the rotating black holes. If a test\nparticle rotates around the black hole, its tidal field may resonantly trigger\nthe dynamical transition between a co-rotating state and a dissipative state of\nthe axion cloud. A tidal bulge is generated by the beating of modes, which\nfeeds angular momentum back to the test particle. Following this mechanism, an\nextreme-mass-ratio-inspiral (EMRI) system, as a source for LISA, may face\ndelayed merger as the EMRI orbit stalls by the tidal response of the cloud,\nuntil the cloud being almost fully dissipated. If the cloud depletes slower\nthan the average time separation between EMRI mergers, it may lead to\ninteresting interaction between multiple EMRI objects at comparable radii.\nInclined EMRIs are also expected to migrate towards the black hole equatorial\nplane due to the tidal coupling and gravitational-wave dissipation.

An\nindividual observation allows measurement of the black-hole masses, but only\nlimited information about either the magnitude or orientation of the black hole\nspins is available, primarily due to the degeneracy between measurements of\nspin and binary mass ratio. Using the first six black-hole merger observations,\nwe are able to constrain the distribution of black-hole spins.

For PPISN progenitors with pre-pulse\nmasses $>50M_\\odot$ we find that, after a pulse, heat deposited throughout the\nlayers of the star that remain bound cause it to expand to more than\n$100R_\\odot$ for periods of $10^2-10^4\\;$~yrs depending on the mass of the\nprogenitor. This results in long-lived phases of Roche-lobe overflow or even\ncommon-envelope events if there is a close binary companion, leading to\nadditional electromagnetic transients associated to PPISN eruptions. If we\nignore the effect of these interactions, we find that mass loss from PPISNe\nreduces the final black hole spin by $\\sim 30\\%$, induces eccentricities below\nthe threshold of detectability of the LISA observatory, and can produce a\ndouble-peaked distribution of measured chirp masses in BBH mergers observed by\nground-based detectors. \n\n"}

From our predictions we estimate an intrinsic, unlensed, chirp mass\nof $\\simeq 10-12 M_\\odot$, with a source redshift in the range $0.9<z<2.5$. We\nalso outline a joint analysis over all baseline permutations that can\nstringently test our lensing interpretation of these two events. More\ngenerally, lensed events effectively multiply the number of baseline\npermutations and motivates the use of more interferometers for round the clock\ncoverage of all repeat events of a given source, in order to maximise the\norbital details and sky localization of lensed BBH sources. \n\n"}

We\ninvestigate the equilibrium distribution of binary black holes in the Galaxy.\nGiven the observed BBH merger rate, we contrast the expected number of systems\nradiating in the low-frequency $0.1-10\\,$mHz GW band under two assumptions: (1)\nthat all merging systems originate from near-circular orbits, as may be\nindicative of isolated binary evolution, and (2) that all merging systems\noriginate at very high eccentricity, as predicted by models of\ndynamically-formed BBHs and triple and quadruple systems undergoing Lidov-Kozai\neccentricity oscillations.

Inspiral,\n  transition, and plunge trajectories using a generalized Ori-Thorne procedure Abstract: The last gravitational waves emitted in the coalescence of two black holes\nare quasi-normal ringing modes of the merged remnant. In general relativity,\nthe mass and the spin of the remnant black hole uniquely determine the\nfrequency and damping time of each radiated mode. The amplitudes of these modes\nare determined by the mass ratio of the system and the geometry of the\ncoalescence. This paper is part I of an analysis that aims to compute the\n\"excitation factors\" associated with misaligned binary black hole coalescence.\nTo simplify the analysis, we consider a large mass ratio system consisting of a\nnon-spinning body of mass $\\mu$ that inspirals on a quasi-circular trajectory\ninto a Kerr black hole of mass $M$ and spin parameter $a$, with $\\mu/M \\ll 1$.\nOur goal is to understand how different modes are excited as a function of the\nblack hole spin $a$ and an angle $I$ which characterizes the misalignment of\nthe orbit with the black hole's spin axis. Though the large mass ratio limit\ndoes not describe the binaries that are being observed by gravitational-wave\ndetectors today, this limit makes it possible to quickly and easily explore the\nbinary parameter space, and to develop insight into how the system's late\nringing waves depend on the binary's geometry. In this first analysis, we\ndevelop the worldline which the small body follows as it inspirals and then\nplunges into the large black hole. Our analysis generalizes earlier work by Ori\nand Thorne to describe how a non-equatorial circular inspiral transitions into\na plunging trajectory that falls into the black hole. The worldlines which we\ndevelop here are used in part II as input to a time-domain black hole\nperturbation solver. This solver computes the gravitational waves generated by\nsuch inspirals and plunges, making it possible to characterize the modes which\nthe coalescence excites. \n\n"}

In third Chapter we\ndeveloped the Fourier Transform (FT) of a continuous gravitational wave (CGW)\nfor ground based laser interferometric detectors for the data set of one day\nobservation time incorporating the effects arising due to rotational as well as\norbital motion of the earth.

In even spacetime dimensions they are always unstable,\ndescribing saddle points of the energy, and can be described as {\\it\nsphalerons}. This instability is analysed by constructing the noncontractible\nloops and calculating the Chern--Simons (CS) charges, and also perturbatively\nby numerically constructing the negative modes. This study is restricted to the\nsimplest YM system in spacetime dimensions $d=6,7,8$, which is amply\nillustrative of the generic case. \n\n"}

We develop the\nunified phantom cosmology where the same scalar plays the role of early time\n(phantom) inflaton and late-time Dark Energy. The recent transition from\ndecelerating to accelerating phase is described too by the same scalar field.\nThe (dark) matter may be embedded in this scheme, giving the natural solution\nof the coincidence problem. It is explained how the proposed unified phantom\ncosmology can be fitted against the observations which opens the way to define\nall the important parameters of the model. \n\n"}

In the context of theories with many vacua, such as\nthe landscape of string theory, the effective constants of Nature are\nrandomized by quantum processes during inflation. We discuss an analytic\nestimate for the volume distribution of the constants within each pocket\nuniverse. This is based on the conjecture that the field distribution is\napproximately ergodic in the diffusion regime, when the dynamics of the fields\nis dominated by quantum fluctuations (rather than by the classical drift). We\nthen propose a method for determining the relative abundances of different\ntypes of pocket universes. Both ingredients are combined into an expression for\nthe distribution of the constants in pocket universes of all types. \n\n"}

Considering solutions with\na purely magnetic gauge field, based on the 4-dimensional embedding of $su(2)$\nin $su(4)$, these solutions are labelled by the node numbers $(n_1,n_2,n_3)$ of\nthe three gauge field functions $u_1$, $u_2$ and $u_3$. We classify the various\ntypes of solutions in sequences and determine their limiting solutions. The\nlimiting solutions of the sequences of neutral solutions carry charge, and the\nlimiting solutions of the sequences of charged solutions carry higher charge.\nFor sequences of black hole solutions with node structure $(n,j,n)$ and\n$(n,n,n)$, several distinct branches of solutions exist up to critical values\nof the horizon radius. We determine the critical behaviour for these sequences\nof solutions. We also consider SU(4) Einstein-Yang-Mills-dilaton theory and\nshow that these sequences of solutions are analogous in most respects to the\ncorresponding SU(4) Einstein-Yang-Mills sequences of solutions. \n\n"}

{"id": "quant-ph/0203030", "contents": "Title: Towards Quantum Information Theory in Space and Time Abstract: Modern quantum information theory deals with an idealized situation when the\nspacetime dependence of quantum phenomena is neglected. However the\ntransmission and processing of (quantum) information is a physical process in\nspacetime. Therefore such basic notions in quantum information theory as qubit,\nchannel, composite systems and entangled states should be formulated in space\nand time. In particlular we suggest that instead of a two level system (qubit)\nthe basic notion in a relativistic quantum information theory should be a\nnotion of an elementary quantum system, i.e. an infinite dimensional Hilbert\nspace $H$ invariant under an irreducible representation of the Poincare group\nlabeled by $[m,s]$ where $m\\geq 0$ is mass and $s=0,1/2,1,...$ is spin. We\nemphasize an importance of consideration of quantum information theory from the\npoint of view of quantum field theory. We point out and discuss a fundamental\nfact that in quantum field theory there is a statistical dependence between two\nregions in spacetime even if they are spacelike separated. A classical\nprobabilistic representation for a family of correlation functions in quantum\nfield theory is obtained. Entangled states in space and time are considered. It\nis shown that any reasonable state in relativistic quantum field theory becomes\ndisentangled (factorizable) at large spacelike distances if one makes local\nobservations. As a result a violation of Bell`s inequalities can be observed\nwithout inconsistency with principles of relativistic quantum theory only if\nthe distance between detectors is rather small. We suggest a further\nexperimental study of entangled states in spacetime by studying the dependence\nof the correlation functions on the distance between detectors. \n\n"}
