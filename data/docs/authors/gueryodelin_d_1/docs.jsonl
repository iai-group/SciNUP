This structure emerges from spatial correlations of dynamics that appear\nin disordered systems as they approach non-ergodic or jammed states. It is\ncharacterized in terms of dynamical heterogeneity, facilitation and excitation\nlines. These features are associated with a newly discovered class of\nnon-equilibrium phase transitions. Equilibrium properties have little if\nanything to do with it. The broken symmetries of these transitions are obscure\nor absent in spatial structures, but they are vivid in space-time (i.e.,\ntrajectory space). In our view, the glass transition is an example of this\nclass of transitions.

One of\nthe present models is a case with attractive fermion interaction, where an\ninsulator-superfluid transition takes place. The transition is characterized as\nthe transition between a band insulator and a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC)\nsuperfluid state. Differing from the conventional BCS superfluid transition,\nthis transition shows unconventional properties. In contrast to the one\nparticle excitation gap scaled by the superfluid order parameter in the\nconventional BCS transition, because of the multi-band effects, a large gap of\none-particle density of states is retained all through the transition although\nthe superfluid order grows continuously from zero.

If we can consider the entanglement entropy as thermodynamic entropy, we\ncan see the entropic force acting on the two black holes from the $r$\ndependence of $S_C$. We develop the computational method based on that of\nBombelli et al to obtain the $r$ dependence of $S_C$ of scalar fields whose\nLagrangian is quadratic with respect to the scalar fields. First we study $S_C$\nin $d+1$ dimensional Minkowski spacetime. In this case the state of the\nmassless free scalar field is the Minkowski vacuum state and we replace two\nblack holes by two imaginary spheres, and we take the trace over the degrees of\nfreedom residing in the imaginary spheres. We obtain the leading term of $S_C$\nwith respect to $1/r$.

In particular, we determine when it is favorable for the\ndressed impurity (polaron) to bind particles from the Fermi sea to form a\ndimer, trimer or even larger clusters. Similarly to 3D, we find that the Fermi\nsea favors the trimer state so that it exists for M/m less than the critical\nmass ratio for trimer formation in the vacuum.

The constraints\nthat preserve the topological configuration of the plat are imposed on the\npolymer trajectories using the so-called Gauss linking number, a topological\ninvariant that has already been well studied in polymer physics. Due to these\nconstraints, short-range forces act on the monomers or, equivalently, on the\nanyon quasiparticles in a way that closely resembles the appearance of reaction\nforces in the constrained systems of classical mechanics.

We then study the internal energy shift\nand deviations from the energy-pressure proportionality in low dimensional\nmodels of gases interpolating between the ideal Bose and the ideal Fermi gases,\nfocusing on the Lieb-Liniger model in 1d and on the anyonic gas in 2d. In 1d\nthe internal energy shift is determined from the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz\nintegral equations and an explicit relation for it is given at high\ntemperature. Our results show that the internal energy shift is positive, it\nvanishes in the two limits of zero and infinite coupling (respectively the\nideal Bose and the Tonks Girardeau gas) and it has a maximum at a finite,\ntemperature depending, value of the coupling.

Going to a time-dependent interaction picture, we can\norganize the effective Hamiltonian by powers of ${N}^{-1/2}$.

In this case, there\ncan be multiple distinct quantum phases with the same anyons and statistics,\nbut with different patterns of symmetry fractionalization - termed symmetry\nenriched topological (SET) order. When the global symmetry group $G$, which we\ntake to be discrete, does not change topological superselection sectors - i.e.\ndoes not change one type of anyon into a different type of anyon - one can\nimagine a local version of the action of $G$ around each anyon.

Here, for the first time, in the framework of a\ncluster MF treatment, we extract the signature of EE in the bosonic\nsuperfluid-insulator transitions. We consider a trimerized Kagome lattice of\ninteracting bosons, in which each trimer is treated as a cluster, and implement\nthe cluster MF treatment by decoupling all inter-trimer hopping.

In this\npaper, we consider a more realistic one-clean qubit model, where the clean\nqubit is not clean, but depolarized.

For single-domain inclusions we\ndemonstrate that the interactions are very long range, and their magnitudes\nstrongly depend on the affinity of the inclusions with the species in the\nbinary mixtures, ranging from repulsive when two inclusions have opposing\naffinities to attractive when they have the same affinities. When one of the\ninclusions has no preference for either of the species, we find negligible\ncritical Casimir interactions. For multiple-domain inclusions, mimicking the\nobservations that membrane proteins often have several domains with varying\naffinities to the surrounding lipid species, the presence of domains with\nopposing affinities does not cancel the interactions altogether. Instead we can\nobserve both attractive and repulsive interactions depending on their relative\norientations.

However, pinning down the responsible mechanisms is often\ndifficult, since the response to irradiation is governed by complex many-body\ndynamics. In contrast to static systems, where extensive calculations have been\nperformed to explain phenomena such as high-temperature superconductivity,\ntheoretical analyses of driven many-body Hamiltonians are more demanding and\nnew theoretical approaches have been inspired by the recent observations.

Both the speed and\nthe direction of the self-propulsion and the strength of attractive interaction\nbetween the particles can be controlled by tuning the frequency of the applied\nelectric field and the ion concentration of the solution. The strong attractive\nforce at high ion concentration give rise to chain formation of the Janus\nparticles, which can be explained by the quadrupolar charge distribution on the\nparticles. The chain formation is observed irrespective of the direction of the\nself-propulsion of the particles. When both the positions and the orientations\nof the heads of chains are fixed, they exhibit beating behavior reminiscent of\neukaryotic flagella. The beating frequency of the chains of the Janus particles\ndepends on the applied voltage and thus on the self-propulsive force. The\nscaling relation between the beating frequency and the self-propulsive force\ndeviates from theoretical predictions made previously on active filaments.\nHowever, this discrepancy is resolved by assuming that the attractive\ninteraction between the particles is mediated by the quadrupolar distribution\nof the induced charges, which gives indirect but convincing evidence on the\nmechanisms of the Janus particles. This signifies that the dependence between\nthe propulsion mechanism and the interaction mechanism, which had been\ndismissed previously, can modify dispersion relations of beating behaviors. In\naddition, hydrodynamic interaction within the chain and its effect on\npropulsion speed are discussed.

The conventional approach is to retain the foundational principles of\nQT, such as the superposition principle, and modify GR. This is referred to as\n`quantizing gravity', resulting in a theory of `quantum gravity'. The opposite\napproach is `gravitizing QT' where we attempt to keep the principles of GR,\nsuch as the equivalence principle, and consider how this leads to modifications\nof QT. What we are most lacking in understanding which route to take, if\neither, is experimental guidance. Here we consider using a Bose-Einstein\ncondensate (BEC) to search for clues. In particular, we study how a single BEC\nin a superposition of two locations could test a gravitizing QT proposal where\nwavefunction collapse emerges from a unified theory as an objective process,\nresolving the measurement problem of QT. Such a modification to QT due to\ngeneral relativistic principles is testable near the Planck mass scale, which\nis much closer to experiments than the Planck length scale where quantum,\ngeneral relativistic effects are traditionally anticipated in quantum gravity\ntheories. Furthermore, experimental tests of this proposal should be simpler to\nperform than recently suggested experiments that would test the quantizing\ngravity approach in the Newtonian gravity limit by searching for entanglement\nbetween two massive systems that are both in a superposition of two locations. \n\n"}

The formalism ensures that SMS free energy exists all the\nway to T=0, and remains stable. We introduce the concept of the reality\ncondition, according to which the entropy $S(T)$ of a set of coupled degrees of\nfreedom must be non-negative. The entropy crisis, which does not affect\nstability, is identified as the violation of the reality condition. We identify\nand validate rigorously, using general thermodynamic arguments, the following\ngeneral thermodynamic mechanism behind the entropy crisis in SMS. The free\nenergy $F_{\\text{dis}}(T)$ of any SMS must be equal to the T=0 crystal free\nenergy $E_{0}$ at two different temperatures $T=0,$ and $T=T_{\\text{eq}}>0$.\nThus, the stability requires $F_{\\text{dis}}(T)$ to possess a maximum at an\nintermediate but a strictly positive temperature $T_{\\text{K}},$ where the\nenergy is $E=E_{\\text{K}}.$ The SMS branch below $T_{\\text{K}}$ gives the\nentropy crisis and must be replaced by hand by an ideal glass free energy of\nconstant energy $E_{\\text{K}},$ and vanishing entropy. Hence, $T_{\\text{K}}>0$\nrepresents the Kauzmann temperature. The ideal glass energy $E_{\\text{K}}$ is\nhigher than the crystal energy $E_{0}$ at absolute zero, which is in agreement\nwith the experimenatal fact that the extrapolated energy of a real glass at T=0\nis higher than its T=0 crystal energy. We confirm the general predictions by\ntwo exact calculations, one of which is not mean-field. The calculations\nclearly show that the notion of SMS is not only not vaccuous, but also not a\nconsequence of a mean-field analysis. They also show that certain folklore\ncannot be substantiated. \n\n"}

This is the experimentally realistic\nscenario for e.g. colloidal dispersions. The simulations are used to obtain the\ncloud and shadow curve properties of a Lennard-Jones fluid having diameters\ndistributed according to a Schulz form with a large (40%) degree of\npolydispersity. Good qualitative accord is found with the results from a MFE\nmethod study of a corresponding van der Waals model that incorporates\nsize-dispersity both in the hard core reference and the attractive parts of the\nfree energy. The results show that polydispersity engenders considerable\nbroadening of the coexistence region between the cloud curves. The principal\neffect of fractionation in this region is a common overall scaling of the\nparticle sizes and typical inter-particle distances, and we discuss why this\neffect is rather specific to systems with Schulz diameter distributions. Next,\nby studying a family of such systems with distributions of various widths, we\nestimate the dependence of the critical point parameters on $\\delta$. In\ncontrast to a previous theoretical prediction, size-dispersity is found to\nraise the critical temperature above its monodisperse value. Unusually for a\npolydisperse system, the critical point is found to lie at or very close to the\nextremum of the coexistence region in all cases. We outline an argument showing\nthat such behaviour will occur whenever size polydispersity affects only the\nrange, rather than the strength of the inter-particle interactions. \n\n"}

Using a diagrammatic representation for f_xc, we express its excitonic\npart f_xc^Ex in terms of the effective vertex function Lambda.

This question has assumed some importance in recent\nyears due to the advent of nano technology and the growing use of nanometer\nscale devices and structures. In a small system, the size limits the scale of\nthe fluctuations and makes it imperative for us to understand how the response\nof the system is altered in such a situation. In this thesis, this question is\nanswered for the special case of interfacial fluctuations in two dimensions\n(2d). The energy of an interface between two phases in equilibrium is invariant\nwith respect to translations perpendicular to the plane (or line in 2d) of the\ninterface.

Here, we start with Mohr-Coulomb\nplasticity for quasi-2D granular materials to calculate (average) stresses and\nslip planes, but we propose a \"stochastic flow rule\" (SFR) to replace the\nprinciple of coaxiality in classical plasticity. The SFR takes into account two\ncrucial features of granular materials - discreteness and randomness - via\ndiffusing \"spots\" of local fluidization, which act as carriers of plasticity.\nWe postulate that spots perform random walks biased along slip-lines with a\ndrift direction determined by the stress imbalance upon a local switch from\nstatic to dynamic friction. In the continuum limit (based on a Fokker-Planck\nequation for the spot concentration), this simple model is able to predict a\nvariety of granular flow profiles in flat-bottom silos, annular Couette cells,\nflowing heaps, and plate-dragging experiments -- with essentially no fitting\nparameters -- although it is only expected to function where material is at\nincipient failure and slip-lines are inadmissible. For special cases of\nadmissible slip-lines, such as plate dragging under a heavy load or flow down\nan inclined plane, we postulate a transition to rate-dependent Bagnold\nrheology, where flow occurs by sliding shear planes.

If one diagonalizes the geometric terms in the infinitesimal\nneighborhood of level crossing, the geometric phases become trivial (and thus\nno monopole singularity) for arbitrarily large but finite time interval $T$.\nThe integrability of Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation and the appearance of the\nseemingly non-integrable phases are thus consistent. The topological proof of\nthe Longuet-Higgins' phase-change rule, for example, fails in the practical\nBorn-Oppenheimer approximation where a large but finite ratio of two time\nscales is involved and $T$ is identified with the period of the slower system.\nThe difference and similarity between the geometric phases associated with\nlevel crossing and the exact topological object such as the Aharonov-Bohm phase\nbecome clear in the present formulation. A crucial difference between the\nquantum anomaly and the geometric phases is also noted. \n\n"}

In the linear method, the parameter\nvariations are found by diagonalizing a non-symmetric estimator of the\nHamiltonian matrix in the space spanned by the wave function and its\nderivatives with respect to the parameters, making use of a strong\nzero-variance principle. In the less computationally expensive perturbative\nmethod, the parameter variations are calculated by approximately solving the\ngeneralized eigenvalue equation of the linear method by a nonorthogonal\nperturbation theory.
