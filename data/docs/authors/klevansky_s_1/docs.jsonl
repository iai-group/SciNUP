This is what one\nusually calls 'spontaneous CP violation'. The number of free parameters turned\nout, then, to be even smaller than in the original minimal model and good fits\nto all known masses and mixings were obtained. Out of those papers only that of\nAulakh and Garg discusses how CP is spontaneously violated.

Because of this cancellation, regulation of the matter field\nzero-point energy density is not needed, and thus does not cause any trace\nanomaly to arise. We exhibit our results in two theories of gravity that are\nwell-defined quantum-mechanically. Both of these theories are locally conformal\ninvariant, quantum Einstein gravity in two dimensions and Weyl-tensor-based\nquantum conformal gravity in four dimensions (a fourth-order derivative quantum\ntheory of the type that Bender and Mannheim have recently shown to be\nghost-free and unitary). Central to our approach is the requirement that any\nand all departures of the geometry from Minkowski are to be brought about by\nquantum mechanics alone. Consequently, there have to be no fundamental\nclassical fields, and all mass scales have to be generated by dynamical\ncondensates. In such a situation the trace of the matter field energy-momentum\ntensor is zero, a constraint that obliges its cosmological constant and\nzero-point contributions to cancel each other identically, no matter how large\nthey might be. Quantization of the gravitational field is caused by its\ncoupling to quantized matter fields, with the gravitational field not needing\nany independent quantization of its own.

The role of the \\omega-meson degree of freedom in the source for\nnucleon mass observed in this paper is highly reminiscent of its important role\nin the skyrmion description of nucleon mass in hidden local symmetric theory.\nOne of the most notable novel results found in this paper is that the nucleon\nmass in dense baryonic medium undergoes a drop roughly linear in density up to\na density (denoted $\\tilde{n}$) slightly above nuclear matter density ($n_0$)\nand then stays more or less constant up to the dilaton limit fixed point.

Near threshold, enhancements in the relevant amplitudes that go as\ninverse powers of the stop-antistop relative velocity require resummations of\nperturbation theory and/or nonperturbative treatments. We present a complete\nformulation of threshold effects at leading order in the stop-antistop relative\nvelocity in terms of nonrelativistic effective field theory. We give detailed\nnumerical calculations for the case in which the stop-antistop Green's function\nis modeled with a Coulomb-Schr\\\"odinger Green's function. We find several\ngeneral effects that do not appear in a purely perturbative treatment.\nHiggs-stop-antistop mixing effects displace physical masses from the threshold\nregion, thereby rendering the perturbative threshold enhancements inoperative.\nIn the case of large Higgs-stop-antistop couplings, the displacement of a\nphysical state above threshold substantially increases its width, owing to its\ndecay width to a stop-antistop pair, and greatly reduces its contribution to\nthe cross section. \n\n"}

The\nstatistical robustness and volatility observables, for tagging, are obtained\nsimultaneously.

On the other hand, our\nanalysis of the ratios R_c and R_n of the CP-averaged branching ratios of the\ncharged and neutral B -> pi K modes, respectively, suggested new physics (NP)\nin the electroweak penguin sector, which may have a powerful interplay with\nrare decays. In this paper, we confront our strategy with recent experimental\ndevelopments, addressing also the direct CP violation in B_d -> pi^-+ K^+-,\nwhich is now an established effect, the relation to its counterpart in B^+- ->\npi^0 K^+-, and the first results for the direct CP asymmetry of B_d -> pi^0\npi^0 that turn out to be in agreement with our prediction. We obtain hadronic B\n-> pi pi,pi K parameters which are almost unchanged and arrive at an allowed\nregion for the unitarity triangle in perfect accordance with the SM. The ``B ->\npi K puzzle'' persists, and can still be explained through NP, as in our\nprevious analysis.

Abstract: Form factors of a simple system have been calculated in various forms of\nrelativistic quantum mechanics, using a single-particle current. Their\ncomparison has shown large discrepancies. The comparison is extended here to\ninstant- and front-form calculations in unusual momentum configurations as well\nas to a point-form approach inspired from the Dirac's one (based on a\nhyperboloid surface). It is found that these new results depend on the momentum\ntransfer, Q, through its ratio to the total mass, Q/M, (closely related to the\nBreit-frame velocity of the system). They evidence features similar for a part\nto those shown by an earlier ``point-form'' implementation (based on\nhyperplanes perpendicular to the velocity of the initial and final states). It\nthus appears that the standard instant- and front-form calculations, which\ngenerally do well compared either to experiment or to predictions of a\ntheoretical model, rather represent exceptional cases. An argument explaining\nthe success of these last approaches is presented and discussed. It is based on\ntransformations of currents under Poincar\\'e space-time translations, going\nbeyond the energy-momentum conservation property which results from the\nLagrangian invariance under them.

The signal\nshould be observable even if multiple domains of D$\\chi$C form provided the\naverage number of pions per domain is significantly larger than unity. The\nvariance of the number charged pions alone provides a signal which can be used\neven if the number of neutral pions cannot be measured in a given detector. On\nthe other hand, the probability distribution in $R$, the proportion of neutral\npions to all pions emitted in heavy ion collisions in certain kinematic\nregions, has been suggested as a signal of a disoriented chiral condensate.\nHere we note that the signature can be greatly enhanced by making suitable cuts\nin the data. In particular, we consider reducing the data set such that the $k$\npions with lowest $p_T$ are all neutral. We find that, given such cuts, $<R>$\ncan be substantially different from 1/3.
