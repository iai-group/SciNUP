Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on\nthe role that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in\nglobular clusters, e.g., influencing the distribution of horizontal branch\nstars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of some globular clusters, and in\nforming low mass white dwarfs. \n\n"}

As young AGN\n(quasars) they are initially several magnitudes sub-luminous to mature galaxies\nbut their luminosity gradually increases over 10^8 yrs, as z_(i) decreases and\nthey evolve into mature AGN (Seyferts and radio galaxies). Evidence presented\nhere that low- and intermediate-redshift AGN are unquestionably sub-luminous to\nradio galaxies is then strong support for this model and makes it likely that\nthe high-redshift AGN (quasars) are also sub-luminous, having simply been\npushed above the radio galaxies on a logz-m_(v) plot by the presence of a large\nintrinsic component in their redshifts. An increase in luminosity below z =\n0.06 is also seen. It is associated in the DIR model with an increase in\nluminosity as the sources mature but, if real, is difficult to interpret in the\ncosmological redshift (CR) model since at this low redshift it is unlikely to\nbe associated with a higher star formation rate or an increase in the material\nused to build galaxies.

The number ratios are measured\nindirectly in the simulations due to their resolution limitations. Our approach\ncontains one free parameter, the lifetime of a protostellar object t_yso (Class\n0 + Class I stages), which is outside the realm of the simulations. Assuming a\nvalue t_yso = 0.46 Myr, we obtain number ratios of starless to stellar cores\nranging from 4-5 at n_thr = 1.5 x 10^4 cm^-3 to 1 at n_thr = 1.2 x 10^5 cm^-3,\nagain in good agreement with observational determinations.

The galaxy is known to possess a dramatic 70 kpc\nX-ray tail. The detected H-alpha tail coincides positionally with the X-ray\ntail. The H-alpha emission in the galaxy is sharply truncated on the front and\nthe sides near the nucleus, indicating significant ram pressure stripping. ESO\n137-001 is thus the first cluster late-type galaxy known unambiguously with\nboth an X-ray tail and an H-alpha tail. The emission-line objects are all\ndistributed downstream of the galaxy, with projected distance up to 39 kpc from\nthe galaxy. From the analysis on the H-alpha_{off} frame and the estimate of\nthe background emission-line objects, we conclude that it is very likely all 29\nemission-line objects are HII regions in A3627. The high surface number density\nand luminosities of these HII regions (up to 10^40 ergs/s) dwarf the previously\nknown examples of isolated HII regions in clusters.

The total mass of formed stars in the stripped ISM of ESO\n137-001 may approach several times 10^7 solar masses. Therefore, stripping of\nthe ISM not only contributes to the ICM, but also adds to the intracluster\nstellar light through subsequent star formation.

However, the cause of a\nreduced scintillation efficiency relative to electronic recoils in noble\nliquids remains unclear at the moment. We attribute such a reduction of\nscintillation efficiency to two major mechanisms: 1) energy loss and 2)\nscintillation quenching.

For 3-dimensional clustering statistics, we find\nthat none of the internal error methods investigated are able to reproduce\nneither accurately nor robustly the errors of external estimators on 1 to 25\nMpc/h scales. The standard bootstrap overestimates the variance of xi(s) by\n~40% on all scales probed, but recovers, in a robust fashion, the principal\neigenvectors of the underlying covariance matrix. The jackknife returns the\ncorrect variance on large scales, but significantly overestimates it on smaller\nscales. This scale dependence in the jackknife affects the recovered\neigenvectors, which tend to disagree on small scales with the external\nestimates. Our results have important implications for the use of galaxy\nclustering in placing constraints on cosmological parameters. For example, in a\n2-parameter fit to the projected correlation function, we find that the\nstandard bootstrap systematically overestimates the 95% confidence interval,\nwhile the jackknife method remains biased, but to a lesser extent. The scatter\nwe find between realizations, for Gaussian statistics, implies that a 2-sigma\nconfidence interval, as inferred from an internal estimator, could correspond\nin practice to anything from 1-sigma to 3-sigma. Finally, by an oversampling of\nsub-volumes, it is possible to obtain bootstrap variances and confidence\nintervals that agree with external error estimates, but it is not clear if this\nprescription will work for a general case. \n\n"}

This allows the cluster age to be established with high precision,\nusing isochrones in the mass-radius diagram. We employ high-resolution UVES\nspectroscopy of V20 to determine the spectroscopic orbit and time-series V, I\nphotometry to obtain the photometric elements. The masses and radii of the V20\ncomponents are found to be1.074+/-0.008Msun and 1.399+/-0.016Rsun (primary) and\n0.827+/-0.004Msun and 0.768+/-0.006Rsun (secondary). The primary is located\nalmost exactly at the hottest point along the cluster isochrone, and the\nsecondary is a ~7 times fainter main--sequence star. We determine an apparent\ncluster distance-modulus of (m-M)_V = 13.46+/-0.10 (average of primary and\nsecondary). The cluster age is obtained from comparisons with theoretical\nisochrones in the mass--radius diagram.

The shape of the bright end of the\nA3266-Coma composite IR LF is not significantly different from that of nearby\nfield galaxies, but the fraction of IR-bright galaxies (SFR > 0.2M_sun/yr) in\nboth clusters increases with cluster-centric radius. The decrease of the blue\ngalaxy fraction toward the high density cores only accounts for part of the\ntrend; the fraction of red galaxies with moderate SFRs (0.2 < SFR < 1 M_sun/yr)\nalso decreases with increasing galaxy density. These results suggest that for\nthe IR bright galaxies, nearby rich clusters are distinguished from the field\nby a lower star-forming galaxy fraction, but not by a change in L*_IR. The\ncomposite IR LF of Coma and A3266 shows strong evolution when compared with the\ncomposite IR LF of two z~0.8 clusters, MS 1054 and RX J0152, with L*_IR \\propto\n(1+z)^{3.2+/-0.7},Phi*_IR \\propto (1+z)^{1.7+/-1.0}.

However, these\nmodels are only fully constrained if both the mass and age are known. We have\nused the Keck adaptive optics system to monitor the orbit of HD 130948BC, a\nbrown dwarf binary that is a companion to the young solar analog HD 130948A.\nThe total dynamical mass of 0.109+/-0.003 Msun shows that both components are\nsubstellar, and the ensemble of available age indicators from the primary star\nsuggests an age comparable to the Hyades, with the most precise age being 0.79\nGyr based on gyrochronology. Therefore, HD 130948BC is unique among field L and\nT dwarfs as it possesses a well-determined mass, luminosity, and age. Our\nresults indicate that substellar evolutionary models may underpredict the\nluminosity of brown dwarfs by as much as a factor of ~2-3x.

We\nhave mapped it in 352 GHz continuum, SiO (J=8-7), and HCO+ (J=4-3) emission at\nup to ~ 0.2\" resolution with the Submillimeter Array (SMA). The continuum\nsource is now resolved into two sources, SMM1 and SMM2, with a separation of ~\n84 AU. SMM1 is seen at the center of the jet, probably tracing a (inner) dusty\ndisk around the protostar driving the jet. SMM2 is seen to the southwest of\nSMM1 and may trace an envelope-disk around a small binary companion. A\nflattened envelope-disk is seen in HCO+ around SMM1 with a radius of ~ 80 AU\nperpendicular to the jet axis. Its velocity structure is consistent with a\nrotation motion and can be fitted with a Keplerian law that yields a mass of ~\n50+-15 Jupiter mass (a mass of a brown dwarf) for the protostar. Thus, the\nprotostar could be the lowest mass source known to have a collimated jet and a\nrotating flattened envelope-disk. A small-scale (~ 200 AU) low-speed (~ 2 km/s)\noutflow is seen in HCOP+ around the jet axis extending from the envelope-disk.\nIt seems to rotate in the same direction as the envelope-disk and may carry\naway part of the angular momentum from the envelope-disk. The jet is seen in\nSiO close to ~ 100 AU from SMM1. It is seen with a \"C-shaped\" bending. It has a\ntransverse width of <~ 40 AU and a velocity of ~ 170+-60 km/s. A possible\nvelocity gradient is seen consistently across its innermost pair of knots, with\n~ 0.5 km/s at ~ 10 AU, consistent with the sense of rotation of the\nenvelope-disk. If this gradient is an upper limit of the true rotational\ngradient of the jet, then the jet carries away a very small amount of angular\nmomentum of ~ 5 AU km/s and thus must be launched from the very inner edge of\nthe disk near the corotation radius. \n\n"}

We associate these velocity\nstreams with two quasi-periodic orbital families, librating around the stable\nx_1(1) and x_1(2) orbits near the bar's outer Lindblad resonance (OLR). In a\nreference frame moving with the bar, these otherwise stationary orbits precess\non a timescale dependent on the strength of the bar, consistent with\npredictions from a simple Hamiltonian model for the resonance. This behavior\nallows the two orbital families to reach the solar neighborhood and manifest\nthemselves as clumps in the u-v plane moving away from (x_1(2)), and toward\n(x_1(1)) the Galactic center. Depending on the bar parameters and time since\nits formation, this model is consistent with the Pleiades and Coma Berenices,\nor Pleiades and Sirius moving groups seen in the Hipparcos stellar velocity\ndistribution, if the Milky Way bar angle is 30<phi_0<45 [deg] and its pattern\nspeed is Omega_b/Omega_0=1.82\\pm 0.07, where Omega_0 is the angular velocity of\nthe local standard of rest (LSR).

In general it\nconsists of two parts, one independent of and another one proportional to the\nmean magnetic field. The first part may be nonzero only in the presence of mhd\nturbulence, maintained, e.g., by small-scale dynamo action. It corresponds to a\nbattery, which lets a mean magnetic field grow from zero to a finite value. The\nsecond part, which covers, e.g., the alpha effect, is important for large-scale\ndynamos. Only a few examples of the aforementioned first part of mean\nelectromotive force have been discussed so far. It is shown that a mean\nelectromotive force proportional to the mean fluid velocity, but independent of\nthe mean magnetic field, may occur in an originally homogeneous isotropic mhd\nturbulence if there are nonzero correlations of velocity and electric current\nfluctuations or, what is equivalent, of vorticity and magnetic field\nfluctuations.

We show that the distribution of\ndark-matter halos is naturally described by a multivariate bias scheme where\nthe halo overdensity depends not only on the underlying matter density\nfluctuation delta, but also on the Gaussian part of the primordial\ngravitational potential phi. This corresponds to a non-local bias scheme in\nterms of delta only. We derive the coefficients of the bias expansion as a\nfunction of the halo mass by applying the peak-background split to common\nparametrizations for the halo mass function in the non-Gaussian scenario. We\nthen compute the halo power spectrum and halo-matter cross spectrum in the\nframework of Eulerian perturbation theory up to third order. Comparing our\nresults against N-body simulations, we find that our model accurately describes\nthe numerical data for wavenumbers k < 0.1-0.3 h/Mpc depending on redshift and\nhalo mass. In our multivariate approach, perturbations in the halo counts trace\nphi on large scales and this explains why the halo and matter power spectra\nshow different asymptotic trends for k -> 0. This strongly scale-dependent bias\noriginates from terms at leading order in our expansion. This is different from\nwhat happens using the standard univariate local bias where the scale-dependent\nterms come from badly behaved higher-order corrections. On the other hand, our\nbiasing scheme reduces to the usual local bias on smaller scales where |phi| is\ntypically much smaller than the density perturbations. We finally discuss the\nhalo bispectrum in the context of multivariate biasing and show that, due to\nits strong scale and shape dependence, it is a powerful tool for the detection\nof primordial non-Gaussianity from future galaxy surveys. \n\n"}

We built a simple and fast non-hydrodynamic\nmodel, QWIND, where we assume that a wind is launched from the accretion disc\nat supersonic velocities of the order of a few 10^2 km/s and we concentrate on\nthe subsequent supersonic phase. We show that this model can produce a wind\nwith terminal velocities of the order of 10^4 km/s. There are three zones in\nthe wind, only the middle one of which can launch a wind: in the inner zone the\nwind is too ionized and so experiences only the Compton radiation force which\nis not effective in accelerating gas. This inner failed wind however plays an\nimportant role in shielding the next zone, lowering the ionization parameter\nthere. In the middle zone the lower ionization of the gas leads to a much\nlarger radiation force and the gas achieves escape velocity This middle zone is\nquite thin (about 100 gravitational radii). The outer, third, zone is shielded\nfrom the UV radiation by the central wind zone and so does not achieve a high\nenough acceleration to reach escape velocity. We also describe a simple\nanalytic approximation of our model, based on neglecting the effects of gravity\nduring the acceleration phase. This analytic approach is in agreement with the\nresults of the numerical code, and is a powerful way to check whether a\nradiation driven wind can be accelerated with a given set of initial\nparameters.

The MHD calculations use the stratified shearing-box approach and\ninclude grain settling and the feedback from the changing dust abundance on the\nresistivity of the gas. The two-decade spread in accretion rates among T Tauri\nstars is too large to result solely from variety in the grain size and stellar\nX-ray luminosity, but can be produced by varying these together with the disk\nmagnetic flux. The diversity in the silicate bands can come from the coupling\nof grain settling to the distribution of the magneto-rotational turbulence,\nthrough three effects: (1) Recombination on grains yields a magnetically\ninactive dead zone extending above two scale heights, while turbulence in the\nmagnetically active disk atmosphere overshoots the dead zone boundary by only\nabout one scale height. (2) Grains deep in the dead zone oscillate vertically\nin waves driven by the turbulent layer above, but on average settle at the\nlaminar rates, so the interior of the dead zone is a particle sink and the disk\natmosphere becomes dust-depleted. (3) With sufficient depletion, the dead zone\nis thinner and mixing dredges grains off the midplane. The MHD results also\nshow that the magnetic activity intermittently lifts clouds of dust into the\natmosphere. The photosphere height changes by up to one-third over a few\norbits, while the extinction along lines of sight grazing the disk surface\nvaries by factors of two over times down to 0.1 orbit.

Analysis of the radii of curvature of electron trajectories in the\ninertial observer's frame (IOF) enables these two effects to be considered\ntogether. We demonstrate that for dipolar magnetic field lines on the TS there\nexists a `caustic phase' beyond which no emission can be observed. This phase\ncorresponds to the zero (or minimum) curvature of the IOF trajectories and\nmaximum bunching of the emission. The maximum gradient of polarisation angle\n(PA) in the S-shaped PA curve is also associated with the curvature minimum and\noccurs at exactly the same phase. The asymmetry of trajectory curvature with\nrespect to the dipole axis affects the curvature emissivity and the efficiency\nof pair production, suggesting a minimum at the caustic phase. Emission over a\nfixed range of altitudes, as expected in millisecond pulsars, leads to broad\nleading profiles and sharp peaks with a cutoff phase on the TS.

We identify significant\nsystematic effects in this procedure that can artificially induce an additional\ndiffuse component with a morphology strikingly similar to the claimed gamma-ray\nhaze. To quantitatively illustrate this point we calculate sky-maps of the\nratio of the gamma-ray emission from neutral pions to the ISM column density,\nand of IC to synchrotron emission, using detailed galactic cosmic-ray models\nand simulations. In the region above and below the galactic center, the ISM\ntemplate underestimates the gamma-ray emission due to neutral pion decay by\napproximately 20%. Additionally, the synchrotron template tends to\nunder-estimate the IC emission at low energies (few GeV) and to over-estimate\nit at higher energies (tens of GeV) by potentially large factors that depend\ncrucially on the assumed magnetic field structure of the Galaxy.

Additional observations, including polarisation studies and\nsimultaneous observation of different maser transitions may ultimately lead to\ngreater insight. AIMS: We have aimed to elucidate the nature and structure of\nthe VY CMa water vapour masers in part by observationally testing a theoretical\nprediction of the relative strengths of the 620.701 GHz and the 22.235 GHz\nmaser components of ortho water vapour. METHODS: In its high-resolution mode\n(HRS) the Herschel Heterodyne Instrument for the Infrared (HIFI) offers a\nfrequency resolution of 0.125 MHz, corresponding to a line-of-sight velocity of\n0.06 km/s, which we employed to obtain the strength and linear polarisation of\nmaser spikes in the spectrum of VY CMa at 620.701 GHz. Simultaneous ground\nbased observations of the 22.235 GHz maser with the Max-Planck-Institut f\\\"ur\nRadioastronomie 100-meter telescope at Effelsberg, provided a ratio of 620.701\nGHz to 22.235 GHz emission. RESULTS:We report the first astronomical detection\nto date of water vapour maser emission at 620.701 GHz. In VY CMa both the\n620.701 and the 22.235 GHz polarisation are weak. At 620.701 GHz the maser\npeaks are superposed on what appears to be a broad emission component, jointly\nejected asymmetrically from the star. We observed the 620.701 GHz emission at\ntwo epochs 21 days apart, both to measure the potential direction of linearly\npolarised maser components and to obtain a measure of the longevity of these\ncomponents. Although we do not detect significant polarisation levels in the\ncore of the line, they rise up to approximately 6% in its wings. \n\n"}

Significant currents are seen\nto wrap around the hotter, more elevated regions with lower and more horizontal\nmagnetic field that harbor strong upflows and radial outflows (the\nintraspines). The horizontal component of the current density vector is 3-4\ntimes larger than the vertical; nearly all previous studies only obtain the\nvertical component and thus strongly underestimate the current density. The\ncurrent density and the magnetic field vectors form an angle of about 20\ndegrees. The plasma beta at the 0 km level is larger than 1 in the intraspines\nand is one order of magnitude lower in the background component of the penumbra\n(spines).

We arrive at a set of\ninitial parameters for the cluster which, after 12Gyr of evolution, gives a\nmodel with a fairly satisfactory match to surface brightness and density\nprofiles, the velocity dispersion profile, the luminosity function in two\nfields, and the acceleration of pulsars.

The 3D geometry of these\nray-like features is largely unknown and its knowledge should clarify their\nassociation to the CS and place constraints on CME physics and coronal\nconditions.

An example of such a post-CME ray was observed by various coronagraphs,\nincluding these of the SECCHI instrument suite of the STEREO twin spacecraft\nand the Large Angle Spectrometric Coronagraph LASCO onboard the Solar and\nHeliospheric Observatory (SOHO). The ray was observed in the aftermath of a CME\nwhich occurred on 9 April 2008. The twin STEREO spacecraft were separated by\nabout degrees on that day. This significant separation combined with a third\n\"eye\" view supplied by LASCO allow for a truly multi-viewpoint observation of\nthe ray and of the CME.

We conduct 2-D hydrodynamic simulations\nto study the quasi-steady-state properties of such coronae as the natural\nproducts of the ongoing distributed stellar feedback semi-confined by the\nthermal and ram pressures of the ICM. We find that the temperature of a\nsimulated corona depends primarily on the specific energy of the feedback,\nconsistent with the lack of the correlation between the observed hot gas\ntemperature and K-band luminosity of galaxies. The simulated coronae typically\nrepresent subsonic outflows, chiefly because of the semi-confinement. As a\nresult, the hot gas density increases with the ICM thermal pressure. The ram\npressure, on the other hand, chiefly affects the size and lopsidedness of the\ncoronae. The density increase could lead to the compression of cool gas clouds,\nif present, and hence the formation of stars. The increase also enhances\nradiative cooling of the hot gas, which may fuel central supermassive black\nholes, explaining the higher frequency of active galactic nuclei observed in\nclusters than in the field. The radiation enhancement is consistent with a\nsubstantially higher surface brightness of the X-ray emission detected from\ncoronae in cluster environment. The total X-ray luminosity of a corona,\nhowever, depends on the relative importance of the surrounding thermal and ram\npressures. These environment dependences should at least partly explain the\nlarge dispersion in the observed diffuse X-ray luminosities of spheroids with\nsimilar stellar properties.

We investigate planetary migration by\nanalytically calculating the migration rate and time within self-consistently\ncomputed, radiatively heated discs around M stars in which the effects of dust\nsettling are included.

The method of transit\ntiming variations (TTVs) has already confirmed 7 planets in two planetary\nsystems (Holman et al. 2010; Lissauer et al. 2011a).

We find that at least ~12% of\nplanet candidates currently suitable for TTV analysis show evidence suggestive\nof TTVs, representing at least ~65 TTV candidates. In all cases, the time span\nof observations must increase for TTVs to provide strong constraints on planet\nmasses and/or orbits, as expected based on n-body integrations of multiple\ntransiting planet candidate systems (assuming circular and coplanar orbits). We\nfind that the fraction of planet candidates showing TTVs in this data set does\nnot vary significantly with the number of transiting planet candidates per\nstar, suggesting significant mutual inclinations and that many stars with a\nsingle transiting planet should host additional non-transiting planets.

Thus, TTVs will provide a\npowerful tool for confirming transiting planets and characterizing the orbital\ndynamics of low-mass planets.

In this\ncontribution we elaborate on the formation of sunspots and particularly on the\nformation of penumbrae.

Strong magnetic fields (~10^{15} G) and short spin periods\n(~1-10 ms) have an important influence on how the magnetar interacts with the\ninfalling material. At long spin periods, weak magnetic fields, and high\naccretion rates, sufficient material is accreted to form a black hole, as is\ncommonly found for massive progenitor stars. When B<5*10^{14} G, accretion\ncauses the magnetar to spin sufficiently rapidly to deform triaxially and\nproduce gravitational waves, but only for ~50-200 s until it collapses to a\nblack hole. Conversely, at short spin periods, strong magnetic fields, and low\naccretion rates, the magnetar is in the \"propeller regime\" and avoids becoming\na black hole by expelling incoming material. This process spins down the\nmagnetar, so that gravitational waves are only expected if the initial\nprotoneutron star is spinning rapidly. Even when the magnetar survives, it\naccretes at least ~0.3 solar masses, so we expect magnetars born within these\ntypes of environments to be more massive than the 1.4 solar masses typically\nassociated with neutron stars.

We study trends in HI gas mass fraction (M(HI)/M_*), where M_* is\nthe stellar mass) as a function of black hole accretion rate indicator\nL[OIII]/M(BH). We find no significant difference in HI content between AGN and\ncontrol samples at all values of black hole accretion rate probed by the\ngalaxies in our sample. This indicates that AGN do not influence the\nlarge-scale gaseous properties of galaxies in the local Universe. We have\nstudied the variation in HI mass fraction with black hole accretion rate in the\nblue and red galaxy populations. In the blue population, the HI gas fraction is\nindependent of accretion rate, indicating that accretion is not sensitive to\nthe properties of the interstellar medium of the galaxy on large scales.\nHowever, in the red population accretion rate and gas fraction do correlate.\nThe measured gas fractions in this population are not too different from the\nones expected from a stellar mass loss origin, implying that the fuel supply in\nthe red AGN population could be a mixture of mass loss from stars and gas\npresent in disks. \n\n"}

A test of the two\nhypothesis is whether other cosmic dipoles produced by collapsed structures\nlater than last scattering coincide with the CMB dipole. One background is the\ncosmic infrared background (CIB) whose absolute spectrum was measured to ~30%\nby the COBE satellite. Over the 100 to 500 {\\mu}m wavelength range its spectral\nenergy distribution can provide a probe of its alignment with CMB. This is\ntested with the COBE FIRAS dataset which is available for such a measurement\nbecause of its low noise and frequency resolution important for Galaxy\nsubtraction. Although the FIRAS instrument noise is in principle low enough to\ndetermine the CIB dipole, the Galactic foreground is sufficiently close\nspectrally to keep the CIB dipole hidden. A similar analysis is performed with\nDIRBE, which - because of the limited frequency coverage - provides a poorer a\ndataset. We discuss strategies for measuring the CIB dipole with future\ninstruments to probe the tilt and apply it to the Planck, Herschel and the\nproposed Pixie missions.

The main results\nfollow. (1) We attempted to recover a spectrum of the companion by\ndisentangling the observed spectra of the eps Aur binary failed, but we were\nable to disentangle the spectrum of telluric lines and obtain a mean spectrum\nof the F-type primary star. The latter was then compared to a grid of synthetic\nspectra for a number of plausible values of T(eff) and log(g), but a reasonably\ngood match was not found. However, we conclude that the observed spectrum is\nthat of a low-gravity star. (2) We examined changes in the complex H-alpha line\nprofiles over the past 16 years, with particular emphasis on the 2009-2011\neclipse period, by subtracting a mean out-of-eclipse H-alpha profile\n(appropriately shifted in radial velocity) from the observed spectra. We find\nthat the dark disk around the unseen companion has an extended 'atmosphere'\nthat manifests itself via blueshifted and redshifted H-alpha 'shell'\nabsorptions seen projected against the F star. Significantly, the H-alpha shell\nline first appeared three years before first contact of the optical eclipse\nwhen the system was not far past maximum separation. (3) Analyses of radial\nvelocities and central intensities of several strong, unblended spectral lines,\nas well as UBV photometry, demonstrated that these observables showed apparent\nmultiperiodic variability during eclipse. The dominant period of 66.21 was\ncommon to all the observables, but with different phase shifts between these\nvariables. This result strongly supports our earlier suggestion that the\nphotometric variability seen during eclipse is intrinsic to the F star, and\ntherefore, the idea of a central brightening due to a hole in the disk should\nbe abandoned. \n\n"}

The compression of such data is therefore\nbecoming increasingly important. We develop algorithms to compress data defined\non the sphere. A Haar wavelet transform on the sphere is used as an energy\ncompression stage to reduce the entropy of the data, followed by Huffman and\nrun-length encoding stages.

We evaluate compression performance on simulated CMB data, Earth\ntopography data and environmental illumination maps used in computer graphics.\nThe CMB data can be compressed to approximately 40% of its original size for\nessentially no loss to the cosmological information content of the data, and to\napproximately 20% if a small cosmological information loss is tolerated.

An Analytic Model for Stellar Correlation\n  Functions Abstract: Recently, we have shown that if the ISM is governed by super-sonic turbulent\nflows, the excursion-set formalism can be used to calculate the statistics of\nself-gravitating objects over a wide range of scales. On the largest\nself-gravitating scales ('first crossing'), these correspond to GMCs, and on\nthe smallest non-fragmenting self-gravitating scales ('last crossing'), to\nprotostellar cores. Here, we extend this formalism to rigorously calculate the\nauto and cross-correlation functions of cores (and by extension, young stars)\nas a function of spatial separation and mass, in analogy to the cosmological\ncalculation of halo clustering. We show that this generically predicts that\nstar formation is very strongly clustered on small scales: stars form in\nclusters, themselves inside GMCs. Outside the binary-star regime, the projected\ncorrelation function declines as a weak power-law, until a characteristic scale\nwhich corresponds to the characteristic mass scale of GMCs. On much larger\nscales the clustering declines such that star formation is not strongly biased\non galactic scales, relative to the actual dense gas distribution. The precise\ncorrelation function shape depends on properties of the turbulent spectrum, but\nits qualitative behavior is quite general. The predictions agree well with\nobservations of young star and core autocorrelation functions over ~4 dex in\nradius. Clustered star formation is a generic consequence of supersonic\nturbulence if most of the power in the velocity field, hence the contribution\nto density fluctuations, comes from large scales.

However, when\nobserving the off-limb corona the contribution from the nearby Si XI 30.3 nm\nline can become significant. In this work we aim at estimating the relative\ncontribution of those two lines in the solar corona around the minimum of solar\nactivity.

From simplified one-dimensional models with radial jet structure, we\nfind that a decrease in the relativistic pressure due to the interacting\nrarefaction waves in the central zone of the jet transiently yields a more\npowerful boost of the bulk jet than that expected from single rarefaction\nacceleration. This leads to a cyclic in-situ energy conversion between thermal\nand bulk kinetic energies which induces radial oscillating motion of the jet.\nThe oscillation timescale is characterized by the initial pressure ratio of the\njet to the ambient medium, and follows a simple scaling relation $\\tau_{\\rm\noscillation} \\propto (P_{\\rm jet,0}/P_{\\rm amb,0})^{1/2}$.

Planet ejection can be avoided if the mass of the transplanetary disk\nof planetesimals was large (M_disk>50 M_Earth), but we found that a massive\ndisk would lead to excessive dynamical damping (e.g., final e_55 < 0.01\ncompared to present e_55=0.044, where e_55 is the amplitude of the fifth\neccentric mode in the Jupiter's orbit), and to smooth migration that violates\nconstraints from the survival of the terrestrial planets. Better results were\nobtained when the Solar System was assumed to have five giant planets initially\nand one ice giant, with the mass comparable to that of Uranus and Neptune, was\nejected into interstellar space by Jupiter.

A nearly linear jet was observed which varied\nlittle during a rotation cycle in both R and CN images acquired during the 1999\nand 2010 apparitions. We measured the projected direction of this jet\nthroughout the two apparitions and, under the assumption that the source region\nof the jet was near the comet's pole, determined a rotational pole direction of\nRA/Dec = 151deg/+59deg from CN measurements and RA/Dec = 173deg/+57deg from\ndust measurements (we estimate a circular uncertainty of 3deg for CN and 4deg\nfor dust).

The late-time evolution resembles generic turbulence\nwith -5/3 power spectrum and scale-dependent anisotropy, so I conclude that the\ntearing-driven reconnection becomes turbulent reconnection.

A promising approach to test progenitor models of SNe Ia is to search\nfor the companion in SNRs. Here we present the results of 3D hydrodynamics\nsimulations of the interaction between the SN Ia blast wave and a MS companion\ntaking into consideration its orbital motion and spin. The primary goal of this\nwork is to investigate the rotation of surviving companions after SN Ia\nexplosions in the WD+MS scenario. We use Eggleton's code including the\noptically thick accretion wind model to obtain realistic models of companions.\nThe impact of the SN blast wave on these companions is followed in 3D\nhydrodynamic simulations employing the SPH code GADGET3. We find that the\nrotation of the companion does not significantly affect the amount of stripped\nmass and the kick velocity caused by the SN impact. However, in our\nsimulations, the rotational velocity of the companion is significantly reduced\nto about 14% to 32% of its pre-explosion value due to the expansion of the\ncompanion and the fact that 55%-89% of the initial angular momentum is carried\naway by the stripped matter.

In this paper, we model this type of\ninteraction computationally in one and two dimensions, using a relativistic\nhydrodynamics code with adaptive mesh refinement called RAM, and analytically\nin one dimension. We simulate a blast wave traveling in a stellar wind\nenvironment that encounters a sudden change in density, followed by a\nhomogeneous medium, and compute the observed radiation using a synchrotron\nmodel. We show that flares are not observable for an encounter with a sudden\ndensity increase, such as a wind termination shock, nor for an encounter with a\nsudden density decrease. Furthermore, by extending our analysis to two\ndimensions, we are able to resolve the spreading, collimation, and edge effects\nof the blast wave as it encounters the change in circumburst medium. In all\ncases considered in this paper, we find that a flare will not be observed for\nany of the density changes studied. \n\n"}

Observational\nstudies have uncovered systematically larger rotation velocities in the\nextended polar rings than in the associated host galaxies. In the dark matter\ncontext, this can only be explained through dark halos that are systematically\nflattened along the polar rings. Here, we point out that these objects can also\nbe used as very effective tests of gravity theories, such as those based on\nMilgromian dynamics (MOND). We run a set of polar ring models using both\nMilgromian and Newtonian dynamics to predict the expected shapes of the\nrotation curves in both planes, varying the total mass of the system, the mass\nof the ring with respect to the host, as well as the size of the hole at the\ncenter of the ring. We find that Milgromian dynamics not only naturally leads\nto rotation velocities being typically higher in the extended polar rings than\nin the hosts, as would be the case in Newtonian dynamics without dark matter,\nbut that it also gets the shape and amplitude of velocities correct. Milgromian\ndynamics thus adequately explains this particular property of polar ring\ngalaxies. \n\n"}

We apply\nspectral filters of FWHMs from 0.03 nm to 1 nm to observed Ca line profiles to\nsimulate Ca imaging data. We estimate the relative intensity contributions of\noff-limb and on-disc structures. We compare the synthetic Ca filter imaging\ndata with intensity maps of Ca spectra at different wavelengths and temperature\nmaps at different optical depths. We determine the intensity response function\nfor the wavelengths covered by the filters of different FWHM.\n  The intensity emitted off the solar limb is about 5% of the intensity at disc\ncentre. For a 0.3 nm-wide Ca II H filter, up to about 1/3 of the off-limb\nintensity comes from emission in Hepsilon.

This EHZ provides a qualitative\nguide on where to expect the largest population of planets in the HZ of main\nsequence stars. M stars provide more EHZ real estate than other spectral types,\npossessing 36.5% of the habitable real estate en masse. K stars are second with\n21.5%, while A, F, and G stars offer 18.5%, 6.9% and 16.6%, respectively. Our\ncalculations show that three M dwarfs within 10 pc harbor planets in their\nEHZs.

Mid-Infrared fluxes of quiescent galaxies at\n  redshift 0.3 < z < 2.5: implications for star formation rates and dust\n  heating Abstract: We investigate the star formation rates of quiescent galaxies at high\nredshift (0.3 < z < 2.5) using 3D-HST WFC3 grism spectroscopy and Spitzer\nmid-infrared data. We select quiescent galaxies on the basis of the widely used\nUVJ color-color criteria. Spectral energy distribution fitting (rest frame\noptical and near-IR) indicates very low star formation rates for quiescent\ngalaxies (sSFR ~ 10^-12 yr^-1). However, SED fitting can miss star formation if\nit is hidden behind high dust obscuration and ionizing radiation is re-emitted\nin the mid-infrared. It is therefore fundamental to measure the dust-obscured\nSFRs with a mid-IR indicator. We stack the MIPS-24um images of quiescent\nobjects in five redshift bins centered on z = 0.5, 0.9, 1.2, 1.7, 2.2 and\nperform aperture photometry. Including direct 24um detections, we find sSFR ~\n10^-11.9 * (1+z)^4 yr^-1. These values are higher than those indicated by SED\nfitting, but at each redshift they are 20-40 times lower than those of typical\nstar forming galaxies. The true SFRs of quiescent galaxies might be even lower,\nas we show that the mid-IR fluxes can be due to processes unrelated to ongoing\nstar formation, such as cirrus dust heated by old stellar populations and\ncircumstellar dust. Our measurements show that star formation quenching is very\nefficient at every redshift. The measured SFR values are at z > 1.5 marginally\nconsistent with the ones expected from gas recycling (assuming that mass loss\nfrom evolved stars refuels star formation) and well above that at lower\nredshifts. \n\n"}

The predicted SFR\ndensity and how much of this is contributed by galaxies with different stellar\nmasses and infrared luminosities are in agreement with observations. The model\npredicts a modest evolution of the HI density at z<3, which is also in\nagreement with the observations. The HI density is predicted to be always\ndominated by galaxies with SFR<1Msun/yr. This contrasts with the H2 density,\nwhich is predicted to be dominated by galaxies with SFR>10Msun/yr.

Using the precisely located 870um\nALMA positions of 99 SMGs, together with 24um and radio imaging of this field,\nwe deblend the Herschel/SPIRE imaging of this region to extract their\nfar-infrared fluxes and colours. The median photometric redshifts for ALMA LESS\n(ALESS) SMGs which are detected in at least two SPIRE bands increases with\nwavelength of the peak in their SEDs, with z=2.3+/-0.2, 2.5+/-0.3 and 3.5+/-0.5\nfor the 250, 350 and 500-um peakers respectively.

The latter might be important in connection with magnetic spot\nformation, but the growth rate of NEMPI is suppressed with increasing rotation\nrates, although recent direct numerical simulations (DNS) have shown a\nsubsequent increase in the growth rate. We examine quantitatively whether this\nincrease in the growth rate of NEMPI can be explained by an alpha squared\nmean-field dynamo, and whether both NEMPI and the dynamo instability can\noperate at the same time. We use both DNS and mean-field simulations (MFS) to\nsolve the underlying equations numerically either with or without an imposed\nhorizontal field.

The method relies on a small number of\ndetections of the peak frequency in the postmerger phase for binaries of\ndifferent (relatively low) masses, in the most likely range of expected\ndetections. From such observations, one can construct the derivative of the\npeak frequency versus the binary mass, in this mass range. Through a detailed\nstudy of binary neutron star mergers for a large sample of equations of state,\nwe show that one can extrapolate the above information to the highest possible\nmass (the threshold mass for black hole formation in a binary neutron star\nmerger). In turn, this allows for an empirical determination of the maximum\nmass of cold, nonrotating neutron stars to within 0.1 M_sun, while the\ncorresponding radius is determined to within a few percent. Combining this with\nthe determination of the radius of cold, nonrotating neutron stars of 1.6 M_sun\n(to within a few percent, as was demonstrated in Bauswein et al., PRD, 86,\n063001, 2012), allows for a clear distinction of a particular candidate\nequation of state among a large set of other candidates. Our method is\nparticularly appealing because it reveals simultaneously the moderate and very\nhigh-density parts of the equation of state, enabling the distinction of\nmass-radius relations even if they are similar at typical neutron star masses.\nFurthermore, our method also allows to deduce the maximum central energy\ndensity and maximum central rest-mass density of cold, nonrotating neutron\nstars with an accuracy of a few per cent. \n\n"}

We seek correlations between R(M) and the stiffness of the EOS\nbelow the hyperon threshold needed to pass the 2 Msun test. For NS masses\n1.0<M/Msun<1.6, we get R>13km, because of a very stiff pre-hyperon segment of\nthe EOS. At nuclear density, the pressure is significantly higher than a robust\nupper bound obtained recently using chiral effective field theory.\n  If massive NSs do have a sizable hyperon core, then according to current\nmodels the radii for M=1.0-1.6 Msun are necessarily >13km. If, on the contrary,\na NS with a radius R<12 km is observed in this mass domain, then sizable\nhyperon cores in NSs, as we model them now, are ruled out. Future X-ray\nmissions with <5% precision for a simultaneous M and R measurement will have\nthe potential to solve the problem with observations of NSs. Irrespective of\nthis observational test, present EOS allowing for hyperons that fulfill\ncondition M_max>2 Msun yield a pressure at nuclear density that is too high\nrelative to up-to-date microscopic calculations of this quantity. \n\n"}

These are now extended to three dimensions,\nemploying a spherical grid centred on the planet. Compression of gas is shown\nto reduce rotational motions. Contrasting the 2D case, no clear boundary\ndemarcates bound atmospheric gas from disc material; instead, we find an open\nsystem where gas enters the Bondi sphere at high latitudes and leaves through\nthe midplane regions, or, vice versa, when the disc gas rotates sub-Keplerian.\nThe simulations do not converge to a time-independent solution; instead, the\natmosphere is characterized by a time-varying velocity field. Of particular\ninterest is the timescale to replenish the atmosphere by nebular gas,\n$t_\\mathrm{replenish}$.

A training set is constructed from a systematic\nspectroscopic survey of variables with Hectospec/MMT. In sum, the training set\nincludes ~9000 spectra, for which stellar parameters are measured using the\nSEGUE Stellar Parameters Pipeline (SSPP). We employed the random forest\nalgorithm to perform a non-parametric regression that predicts Teff, log g, and\n[Fe/H] from photometric time-domain observations. Our final, optimized model\nproduces a cross-validated root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 165 K, 0.39 dex,\nand 0.33 dex for Teff, log g, and [Fe/H], respectively. Examining the subset of\nsources for which the SSPP measurements are most reliable, the RMSE reduces to\n125 K, 0.37 dex, and 0.27 dex, respectively, comparable to what is achievable\nvia low-resolution spectroscopy. For variable stars this represents a ~12-20%\nimprovement in RMSE relative to models trained with single-epoch photometric\ncolors.

Abstract: Recently an increasing number of studies were devoted to measure the\nabundances of neutron-capture elements heavier than iron in stars belonging to\nGalactic Open Clusters (OCs). OCs span a sizeable range in metallicity\n-0.6<[Fe/H]<+0.4), and they show abundances of light elements similar to disk\nstars of the same age. A different pattern is observed for heavy elements.

Within this sample, AGN\nhost galaxies have a higher overall percentage of bars (51.8%) than inactive\ngalaxies exhibiting central star formation (37.1%). This difference is\nprimarily due to known effects; that the presence of both AGN and galactic bars\nis strongly correlated with both the stellar mass and integrated colour of the\nhost galaxy. We control for this effect by examining the difference in AGN\nfraction between barred and unbarred galaxies in fixed bins of mass and colour.\nOnce this effect is accounted for, there remains a small but statistically\nsignificant increase that represents 16% of the average barred AGN fraction.\nUsing the $L_{\\rm{[O III]}}/M_{BH} $ratio as a measure of AGN strength, we show\nthat barred AGN do not exhibit stronger accretion than unbarred AGN at a fixed\nmass and colour. The data are consistent with a model in which bar-driven\nfueling does contribute to the probability of an actively growing black hole,\nbut in which other dynamical mechanisms must contribute to the direct AGN\nfueling via smaller, non-axisymmetric perturbations. \n\n"}

We interpret the formation\nprocess in terms of negative effective magnetic pressure instability (NEMPI),\nwhich is a possible mechanism to explain the origin of sunspots. In our\nsimulations, we use a Cartesian domain of isothermal stratified gas that is\ndivided into two layers. In the lower layer, turbulence is forced with\ntransverse nonhelical random waves, whereas in the upper layer no flow is\ninduced. A weak uniform magnetic field is imposed in the entire domain at all\ntimes. In this study we vary the stratification by changing the gravitational\nacceleration, magnetic Reynolds number, strength of the imposed magnetic field,\nand size of the domain to investigate their influence on the formation process.\nBipolar magnetic structure formation takes place over a large range of\nparameters. The magnetic structures become more intense for higher\nstratification until the density contrast becomes around $100$ across the\nturbulent layer. For the Reynolds numbers considered, magnetic flux\nconcentrations are generated at magnetic Prandtl number between 0.1 and 1. The\nmagnetic field in bipolar regions increases with higher imposed field strength\nuntil the field becomes comparable to the equipartition field strength of the\nturbulence. A larger horizontal extent enables the flux concentrations to\nbecome stronger and more coherent. The size of the bipolar structures turns out\nto be independent of the domain size. In the case of bipolar region formation,\nwe find an exponential growth of the large-scale magnetic field, which is\nindicative of a hydromagnetic instability. Additionally, the flux\nconcentrations are correlated with strong large-scale downward and converging\nflows. These findings imply that NEMPI is responsible for magnetic flux\nconcentrations. \n\n"}

Analytical perturbation theory predicts the\nexistence of nested circumbinary orbits that are generalizations of circular\npaths around a single star. These orbits have forced eccentric motion aligned\nwith the binary as well as higher frequency oscillations, yet they do not\ncross, even in the presence of massive disks and perturbations from large\nplanets. For this reason, dissipative gas and planetesimals can settle onto\nthese \"most circular\" orbits, facilitating the growth of protoplanets. Outside\na region close to the binary where orbits are generally unstable, circumbinary\nplanets form in much the same way as their cousins around a single star. Here,\nwe review the theory and confirm its predictions with a suite of representative\nsimulations. We then consider the circumbinary planets discovered with NASA's\nKepler satellite. These Neptune- and Jupiter-size planets, or their\nplanetesimal precursors, may have migrated inward to reach their observed\norbits, since their current positions are outside of unstable zones caused by\noverlapping resonances. In situ formation without migration seems less likely,\nonly because the surface density of the protoplanetary disks must be\nimplausibly high.

Here, we present spectroscopy of\nseven such weak emission line quasars (WLQs) at moderate redshifts (z=1.4-1.7)\nusing the X-shooter spectrograph, which provides simultaneous optical and\nnear-infrared spectroscopy covering the rest-frame ultraviolet through optical.\nThese new observations effectively double the number of WLQs with spectroscopy\nin the optical rest-frame, and they allow us to compare the strengths of (weak)\nhigh-ionization emission lines (e.g., CIV) to low-ionization lines (e.g., MgII,\nHb, Ha) in individual objects. We detect broad Hb and Ha emission in all\nobjects, and these lines are generally toward the weaker end of the\ndistribution expected for typical quasars (e.g., Hb has rest-frame equivalent\nwidths ranging from 15-40 Ang.). However, these low-ionization lines are not\nexceptionally weak, as is the case for high-ionization lines in WLQs.

Specifically, we test\nideal gases with diatomic molecular (gamma = 7/5) and monatomic (gamma = 5/3)\nadiabatic indices. A periodic cube of gas is stirred with purely solenoidal\nforcing at low wavenumbers, leading to a fully-developed turbulent medium.

Its location is determined by the properties of the star, the mass\naccretion rate through the disk, and the size distribution of dust suspended in\nthe disk. We calculate the snow line location from recent observations of mass\naccretion rates and as a function of stellar mass. By taking the observed\ndispersion in mass accretion rates as a measure of the dispersion in initial\ndisk mass, we find that stars of a given mass will exhibit a range of snow line\nlocations. At a given age and stellar mass, the observed dispersion in mass\naccretion rates of 0.4 dex naturally leads to a dispersion in snow line\nlocations of 0.2 dex. For ISM-like dust sizes, the one-sigma snow line location\namong solar mass stars of the same age ranges from 2 to 5 au. For more\nrealistic dust opacities that include larger grains, the snow line is located\nup to two times closer to the star. We use these locations and the outcome of\nN-body simulations to predict the amount of water delivered to terrestrial\nplanets that formed in situ in the habitable zone. We find that the dispersion\nin snow line locations leads to a large range in water content. For ISM-like\ndust sizes, a significant fraction of habitable-zone terrestrial planets around\nsun-like stars remain dry, and no water is delivered to the habitable zones of\nlow-mass M stars (less than half a solar mass) as in previous works. The\ncloser-in snow line in disks with larger grains enables water delivery to the\nhabitable zone for a significant fraction of M stars and all FGK stars.\nConsidering their larger numbers and higher planet occurrence, M stars may host\nmost of the water-rich terrestrial planets in the galaxy if these planets are\nable to hold on to their water in their subsequent evolution. \n\n"}

This\ntechnique relies on the definition of a so-called source surface radius, which\nis often fixed to the canonical value of 2.5Rsun. However this value likely\nvaries from star to star. To resolve this issue, we use our extended set of\n2.5D wind simulations published in 2015, to provide a criteria for the opening\nof field lines as well as a simple tool to assess the source surface radius and\nthe open magnetic flux. This allows us to derive the magnetic torque applied to\nthe star by the wind from any spectropolarimetric observation. We conclude by\ndiscussing some estimations of spin-down time scales made using our technique,\nand compare them to observational requirements. \n\n"}

Two groups of PNe can be differentiated: one old, with low metallicity\n(12+log(O/H)<8.0 and 12+log(Ar/H)<5.7) and another younger with metallicities\nsimilar to the values of H II regions.

The majority\nof massive stars are thought to be born in close binary systems. To date,\nputative binary companions to the progenitors of SNe may have been detected in\nonly two cases, SNe 1993J and 2011dh. We report on the search for a companion\nof the progenitor of the Type Ic SN 1994I, long considered to have been the\nresult of binary interaction. Twenty years after explosion, we used the Hubble\nSpace Telescope to observe the SN site in the ultraviolet (F275W and F336W\nbands), resulting in deep upper limits on the expected companion: F275W > 26.1\nmag and F336W > 24.7 mag. These allows us to exclude the presence of a main\nsequence companion with a mass >~ 10 Msun. Through comparison with theoretical\nsimulations of possible progenitor populations, we show that the upper limits\nto a companion detection exclude interacting binaries with semi-conservative\n(late Case A or early Case B) mass transfer. The limits tend to favor systems\nwith non-conservative, late Case B mass transfer with intermediate initial\norbital periods and mass ratios. The most likely mass range for a putative main\nsequence companion would be ~5--12 Msun, the upper end of which corresponds to\nthe inferred upper detection limit. \n\n"}

Similar results can be drawn from HROs in projected 2D maps with\nintegrated column densities and synthetic polarized dust emission. We\nquantitatively analyze our simulated polarization properties, and interpret the\nreduced polarization fraction at high column densities as the result of\nincreased distortion of magnetic field directions in trans- or super-Alfv\\'enic\ngas. Furthermore, we introduce measures of the inclination and tangledness of\nthe magnetic field along the line of sight as the controlling factors of the\npolarization fraction. Observations of the polarization fraction and angle\ndispersion can therefore be utilized in studying local magnetic field\nmorphology in star-forming regions. \n\n"}

There\nare four known hot RCB stars (DY Cen, MV Sgr, V348 Sgr, and HV 2671), with\nsurface temperatures of 15,000--25,000 K, and prior work has suggested that\nthree of these have secular fading in brightness. I have tested this result by\nmeasuring century-long light curves in the Johnson B-band with modern\ncomparison star magnitudes, and I have extended this by measuring many\nmagnitudes over a wide time range as well as for the fourth hot RCB star. In\nall four cases, the B-band magnitude of the maximum light is now fast fading.\nThe fading rates (in units of magnitudes per century) are 2.5 for DY Cen after\n1960, 1.3 for MV Sgr, 1.3 for V348 Sgr, and 0.7 for HV 2671. This secular\nfading is caused by the expected evolution of the star across the top of the HR\ndiagram at constant luminosity, as the temperature rises and the bolometric\ncorrection changes. For DY Cen, the brightness at maximum light is rising from\n1906 to 1932, and this is caused by the temperature increase from near 5,800 to\n7,500 K. Before 1934 DY Cen had frequent dust dips, while after 1934 there are\nzero dust dips, so there is some apparent connection between the rising\ntemperature and the formation of the dust. Thus, we have watched DY Cen evolve\nfrom an ordinary RCB star up to a hot RCB star and now appearing as an extreme\nhelium star, all in under one century. \n\n"}

The simulation includes radiative cooling,\nstar formation, SN feedback and a central massive black hole which is\nundergoing gas accretion and is heating the surroundings via thermal AGN\nfeedback. A large central region in the ErisBH disk becomes bar-unstable after\nz~1.4, but a clear bar-like structure starts to grow significantly only after\nz~0.4, possibly triggered by the interaction with a massive satellite. At z~0.1\nthe bar reaches its maximum radial extent of l~2.2 kpc. As the bar grows, it\nbecomes prone to buckling instability, which we quantify based on the\nanisotropy of the stellar velocity dispersion. The actual buckling event is\nobservable at z~0.1, resulting in the formation of a boxy-peanut bulge clearly\ndiscernible in the edge-on view of the galaxy at z=0. The bar in ErisBH does\nnot dissolve during the formation of the bulge but remains strongly\nnon-axisymmetric down to the resolution limit of ~100 pc at z=0.

We find that, even with a limited number of modes, the core chemical\nstratification (in particular, the location of the steep chemical transitions\nexpected in the oxygen profile) can be determined quite precisely due to the\nsignificant sensitivity of some confined modes to partial reflexion (trapping)\neffects.

Stellar CMEs can be detected in optical spectra in\nthe Balmer lines, especially in Halpha, as blue-shifted extra\nemission/absorption. To increase the detection probability one can monitor\nyoung open clusters, in which the stars are due to their youth still rapid\nrotators, and thus magnetically active and likely to exhibit a large number of\nCMEs. Using ESO facilities and the Nordic Optical Telescope we have obtained\ntime series of multi-object spectroscopic observations of late-type stars in\nsix open clusters with ages ranging from 15 Myrs to 300 Myrs.

Which mechanisms are responsible for the disc\ndissipation is still debated. Here we investigate the movement through an\nambient medium as a possible cause of disc dispersal. The ram pressure exerted\nby the flow can truncate the disc and the accretion of material with no\nazimuthal angular momentum leads to further disc contraction. We derive a\ntheoretical model from accretion disc theory that describes the evolution of\nthe disc radius, mass, and surface density profile as a function of the density\nand velocity of the ambient medium. We test our model by performing\nhydrodynamical simulations of a protoplanetary disc embedded in a flow with\ndifferent velocities and densities. We find that our model gives an adequate\ndescription of the evolution of the disc radius and accretion rate onto the\ndisc. The total disc mass in the simulations follows the theoretically expected\ntrend, except at the lowest density where our simulated discs lose mass owing\nto continuous stripping. This stripping may be a numerical rather than a\nphysical effect. Some quantitative differences exist between the model\npredictions and the simulations. These are at least partly caused by numerical\nviscous effects in the disc and depend on the resolution of the simulation. Our\nmodel can be used as a conservative estimate for the process of face-on\naccretion onto protoplanetary discs, as long as viscous processes in the disc\ncan be neglected. The model predicts that in dense gaseous environments, discs\ncan shrink substantially in size and can, in theory, sweep up an amount of gas\nof the order of their initial mass. This process could be relevant for planet\nformation in dense environments. \n\n"}

In all cases, the secondary\naccretes part of the ejected mass and also influences the mass-loss rate of the\nAGB star. The ejected mass may remain gravitationally bound to the binary\nsystem and form a circumbinary disk, or contribute to an accretion disk around\nthe secondary.

Here, we use multi-group radiation-hydrodynamics and\nnon-local-thermodynamic-equilibrium radiative transfer to explore the\nproperties of red supergiant (RSG) star explosions embedded in a variety of\ndense envelopes. We consider the cases of an extended static atmosphere or a\nsteady-state wind, adopting a range of mass loss rates. The shock-breakout\nsignal, the SN radiation up to 10d, and the ejecta dynamics are strongly\ninfluenced by the properties of this nearby environment. This compromises the\nuse of early-time observations to constrain Rstar. The presence of narrow lines\nfor 2-3d in 2013fs and 2013cu require a cocoon of material of ~0.01Msun out to\n5-10Rstar. Spectral lines evolve from electron-scattering to Doppler broadened,\nwith a growing blueshift of their emission peaks. Recent studies propose a\nsuper-wind phase with a mass loss rate from 0.001 up to 1Msun/yr in the last\nmonths/years of the RSG life, although there is no observational constraint\nthat this external material is a steady-state outflow. Alternatively,\nobservations may be explained by the explosion of a RSG star inside its complex\natmosphere. Indeed, spatially resolved observations reveal that RSG stars have\nextended atmospheres, with the presence of downflows and upflows out to several\nRstar, even in a standard RSG like Betelgeuse. Mass loading in the region\nintermediate between star and wind can accommodate the 0.01Msun needed to\nexplain the observations of 2013fs.

The primary\nobjective is to determine basic characteristics, the nature and type of the\n2015 outburst of AG Peg.

During the outburst, the luminosity of the hot component was in the\nrange of 2-11$\\times 10^{37}(d/0.8{\\rm kpc})^2$ erg/s.

Additionally, we examine the potential effects of gravitational\ndarkening (GD), revealing that it could significantly amplify disc-integrated\npolarization. GD imparts a non-linear inverse temperature-dependence to the\nresulting polarization.\n  Photopolarimetric observations are sensitive to oblateness and inclination.\nThe degree-of-polarization (DoP) increases in response to both, making it\npotentially useful for assessing the spatial orientation of the BD.

Whereas many previous SZ studies\nhave parameterized the pressure profiles of galaxy clusters, non-parametric\nreconstructions will provide insights into the thermodynamic state of the\nintracluster medium (ICM). Aims: We seek to recover the non-parametric pressure\nprofiles of the high redshift ($z=0.89$) galaxy cluster CLJ 1226.9+3332 as\ninferred from SZ data from the MUSTANG, NIKA, Bolocam, and Planck instruments,\nwhich all probe different angular scales. Methods: Our non-parametric algorithm\nmakes use of logarithmic interpolation, which under the assumption of\nellipsoidal symmetry is analytically integrable. For MUSTANG, NIKA, and Bolocam\nwe derive a non-parametric pressure profile independently and find good\nagreement among the instruments. In particular, we find that the non-parametric\nprofiles are consistent with a fitted gNFW profile.

Abstract: Since its initial discovery, the Fast radio burst (FRB) FRB 121102 has been\nfound to be repeating with millisecond-duration pulses. Very recently, 15 new\nbursts were detected by the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) during its continous\nmonitoring observations. In this letter, we show that the burst energy\ndistribution has a power law form which is very similar to the\nGutenberg-Richter law of earthquakes. In addition, the waiting time of the\nburst has a Gaussian distribution, which is also a distinctive feature of\nearthquakes. These findings suggest that the repeating FRB pulses may originate\nfrom the starquakes of a pulsar. Noting that the soft gamma-ray repeaters\n(SGRs) also exhibit such distributions, the FRB could be powered by some\nmechanism associated with the SGRs, including crustal acitivity of a magnetar,\nsolidification-induced stresss of a young strangeon star, and\noscillation-drivern magnetic activities of a slowly rotating pulsar. These\nconjectures could be tested with more repeating samples. \n\n"}

Bona-fide single planet systems are fitted with a Keplerian model. The\nmultiple planet systems were analyzed using a self-consistent dynamical model\nand their best fit orbits were tested for long-term stability.\n  Results: We confirm or provide supportive arguments for planets around all\nthe investigated stars except for GJ15A, for which we find that the\npost-discovery HIRES data and our CARMENES data do not show a signal at 11.4\ndays.

The stars have mass accretion rates\nspanning from 10^{-12} to 10^{-7} Mo/yr. The line profile was deconvolved into\na low velocity component (LVC, < 40 km/s) and a high velocity component (HVC, >\n40 km/s ), originating from slow winds and high velocity jets, respectively.\nThe LVC is by far the most frequent component, with a detection rate of 77%,\nwhile only 30% of sources have a HVC. The [OI]6300 luminosity of both the LVC\nand HVC, when detected, correlates with stellar and accretion parameters of the\ncentral sources (i.e. Lstar , Mstar , Lacc , Macc), with similar slopes for the\ntwo components. The line luminosity correlates better with the accretion\nluminosity than with the stellar luminosity or stellar mass.

From the model, we find that, if cores are formed from turbulent\ncompressions, they evolve from small to large column densities, increasing\ntheir velocity dispersion as they collapse, while they tend to equipartition\nbetween gravity and kinetic energy.\n  From the observational sample, we find that: (a) cores with substantially\ndifferent column densities in the sample do not follow a Larson-like\nlinewidth-size relation. Instead, cores with higher column densities tend to be\nlocated in the upper-left corner of the Larson velocity dispersion-size\ndiagram, a result predicted previously (Ballesteros-Paredes et al. 2011a). (b)\nThe data exhibit cores with overvirial values.\n  Finally, in the simulations we reproduce the behavior depicted by the model\nand observational sample: cores evolve towards larger velocity dispersions and\nsmaller sizes as they collapse and increase their column density. However,\ncollapsing cores appear to approach overvirial states within a free-fall time.\nThe cause of this apparent excess of kinetic energy is an underestimation of\nthe gravitational energy, due to the assumption that the gravitational energy\nis given by the energy of an isolated sphere of constant column density.

During the first stage of the\ndevelopment work (Phase I), a prototype cryogenic 19 element dual-polarized\narray with \"Kite\" dipole elements was developed and tested on the GBT. The\nmeasured system temperature over efficiency ($T_{sys}/\\eta$) ratio for the bore\nsight beam of the Kite array was 45.5 K at 1.55 GHz. The off-boresight\n$T_{sys}/\\eta$ shows an increase by 13 K at an offset equal to the half power\nbeam width (7$^{'}$.2 at 1.7 GHz). Our measurements indicate that the\noff-boresight degradation and field-of-view (FoV) limitation of the Kite array\nis simply due to the fixed array size. To increase the FoV, a new 19-element\nGBT2 array with larger array spacing was developed during FLAG Phase II. The\nfrequency response of the array was optimized from 1.2 to 1.6 GHz. A system\nwith larger cryostat, new low noise amplifiers (LNAs), down-conversion and\ndigitization close to the front end, unformatted digital transmission over\nfiber, ROACH II based polyphase filter banks (PFBs) with bandwidth 150 MHz and\na data acquisition system that records voltage samples from one of the PFB\nchannels were all developed.

Measurements of the global signal\nwould therefore provide us with a wealth of astrophysical and cosmological\nknowledge. However, the signal has not yet been detected because it must be\nseen through strong foregrounds weighted by a large beam, instrumental\ncalibration errors, and ionospheric, ground and radio-frequency-interference\neffects, which we collectively refer to as \"systematics\". Here, we present a\nsignal extraction method for global signal experiments which uses Singular\nValue Decomposition (SVD) of \"training sets\" to produce systematics basis\nfunctions specifically suited to each observation. Instead of requiring precise\nabsolute knowledge of the systematics, our method effectively requires precise\nknowledge of how the systematics can vary.

{"id": "1711.03490", "contents": "Title: Debris Disc Constraints on Planetesimal Formation Abstract: Two basic routes for planetesimal formation have been proposed over the last\nfew decades. One is a classical \"slow-growth\" scenario. Another one is particle\nconcentration models, in which small pebbles are concentrated locally and then\ncollapse gravitationally to form planetesimals. Both types of models make\ncertain predictions for the size spectrum and internal structure of newly-born\nplanetesimals. We use these predictions as input to simulate collisional\nevolution of debris discs left after the gas dispersal. The debris disc\nemission as a function of a system's age computed in these simulations is\ncompared with several Spitzer and Herschel debris disc surveys around A-type\nstars. We confirm that the observed brightness evolution for the majority of\ndiscs can be reproduced by classical models. Further, we find that it is\nequally consistent with the size distribution of planetesimals predicted by\nparticle concentration models - provided the objects are loosely bound \"pebble\npiles\" as these models also predict. Regardless of the assumed planetesimal\nformation mechanism, explaining the brightest debris discs in the samples\nuncovers a \"disc mass problem.\" To reproduce such discs by collisional\nsimulations, a total mass of planetesimals of up to ~1000 Earth masses is\nrequired, which exceeds the total mass of solids available in the\nprotoplanetary progenitors of debris discs. This may indicate that stirring was\ndelayed in some of the bright discs, that giant impacts occurred recently in\nsome of them, that some systems may be younger than previously thought, or that\nnon-collisional processes contribute significantly to the dust production. \n\n"}

For weaker flares, permanent changes are observed in 6/17\nC-flares. 34.3\\% of the permanent changes occurred in the penumbra and 18.9\\%\nin the umbra. Parts of the penumbra appeared or disappeared in 23/75 flares.\nThe area where permanent changes occur is larger for stronger flares. Strong\nflares also show a larger change of flux, but there is no dependence of the\nmagnetic flux change on the heliocentric angle. The mean rate of change of\nflare-related magnetic field changes is 20.7 Mx cm$^{-2}$ min$^{-1}$.

The uncertainties obtained with ICA are larger\nthan those obtained with the parametric method by a factor $\\sim$1.6 - 1.8.\nThis difference is the trade-off for higher objectivity due to the lack of any\nassumption about the instrument systematics compared to the parametric\napproach.

We find that $22_{-8}^{+26}$% of all massive binary systems merge\nprior to the first core collapse in the system. Of the remainder,\n$86_{-9}^{+11}$% become unbound because of the core-collapse. Remarkably, this\nrarely produce runaway stars (i.e., stars with velocities above 30 km/s). These\nare outnumbered by more than an order of magnitude by slower unbound\ncompanions, or \"walkaway stars\". This is a robust outcome of our simulations\nand is due to the reversal of the mass ratio prior to the explosion and\nwidening of the orbit, as we show analytically and numerically.

The cloud's evolution is characterized by an initial increase in\nits mass, density, and star formation rate (SFR) and efficiency (SFE) as it\ncontracts, followed by a decrease of these quantities as newly formed massive\nstars begin to disrupt the cloud. The main parameter of the model is the\nmaximum mass reached by the cloud during its evolution. Thus, specifying the\ninstantaneous mass and some other variable completely determines the cloud's\nevolutionary stage. We apply the model to interpret the observed scatter in\nSFEs of the cloud sample compiled by Lada et al.\\ as an evolutionary effect so\nthat, although clouds such as California and Orion A have similar masses, they\nare in very different evolutionary stages, causing their very different\nobserved SFRs and SFEs.

(2) pseudo-monochromatic images, created at the wavelengths of the\nmost important emission lines and corrected for continuum light by using the\nP3D visualization tool, provide maps of HII regions, SNR, and the diffuse ISM\nat a high level of sensitivity, allowing for the discovery of planetary\nnebulae, WR stars etc. (3) The use of the P3D line-fitting tool yields emission\nline fluxes, surface brightness, and kinematic information for gaseous objects,\ncorrected for absorption line profiles of the underlying stellar population.\n(4) Visual inspection of the datacubes is demonstrated to be effcient for data\nmining and the discovery of background galaxies and unusual objects.\n  Results. We present a catalogue of luminous stars, rare stars such as WR and\nother emission line stars, carbon stars, symbiotic star candidates, planetary\nnebulae, HII regions, supernova remnants, giant shells, peculiar diffuse and\nfilamentary emission line objects, and background galaxies, along with their\nspectra.\n  Conclusions.

Therefore studies with simulated galaxy clusters have flourished.\nHowever detailed comparisons between simulated and observed clusters and their\npopulation - the galaxies - are complicated by the diversity of clusters and\ntheir surrounding environment. An original way initiated by Bertschinger as\nearly as 1987, to legitimize the one-to-one comparison exercise down to the\ndetails, is to produce simulations constrained to resemble the cluster under\nstudy within its large scale environment. Subsequently several methods have\nemerged to produce simulations that look like the local Universe. This paper\nhighlights one of these methods and its essential steps to get simulations that\nnot only resemble the local Large Scale Structure but also that host the local\nclusters. It includes a new modeling of the radial peculiar velocity\nuncertainties to remove the observed correlation between the decreases of the\nsimulated cluster masses and of the amount of data used as constraints with the\ndistance from us. This method has the particularity to use solely radial\npeculiar velocities as constraints: no additional density constraints are\nrequired to get local cluster simulacra. The new resulting simulations host\ndark matter halos that match the most prominent local clusters such as Coma.\nZoom-in simulations of the latter and of a volume larger than the 30 Mpc/h\nradius inner sphere become now possible to study local clusters and their\neffects.

A drastically different interpretation has been\nsuggested, however, based on the He-enhanced multiple stellar population\nphenomenon as is observed in globular clusters (GCs). Because these two\nscenarios imply very different pictures on the formation of the bulge and\nelliptical galaxies, understanding the origin of the double RC is of crucial\nimportance.

The difference in CN abundance\nand the population ratio between the two RCs are comparable to those observed\nin GCs between the first- and later generation stars.

Nuclear winds\nare often seen in the X-ray spectra through Fe K shell transitions and some of\nthem are called ultra fast outflows (UFOs) due to their high velocities, up to\nsome fractions of the speed of light. If they were able to transfer some\npercentage of the AGN luminosity to the host galaxy, this might be enough to\ntrigger an efficient feedback mechanism. We aim to establish new constraints on\nthe covering fraction and on the kinematic properties of the UFO in the\npowerful (L(bol) ~ 10^(47) erg/s) quasar PDS 456, an established Rosetta stone\nfor studying AGN feedback from disk winds.

They are characterized by overabundances of\ns-process elements. Roughly half of them are enhanced in technetium (Tc), an\ns-process element with no stable isotope, while the other half lack technetium.\nThis dichotomy arises from the fact that Tc-rich S stars are intrinsically\nproducing s-process elements and have undergone third dredge-up (TDU) events,\nwhile Tc-poor S stars owe their s-process overabundances to a past pollution by\na former AGB companion. Our aim is to analyse the abundances of S stars and\ngain insights into their evolutionary status and on the nucleosynthesis of\nheavy s-process elements taking place in their interior. In particular, the\nlocation of extrinsic and intrinsic S stars in the HR diagram will be compared\nwith the theoretical onset of the TDU on the thermally-pulsing AGB. A sample of\n19 S-type stars was analysed by combining HERMES high-resolution spectra,\naccurate Gaia Data Release 2 (GDR2) parallaxes, stellar-evolution models, and\nnewly-designed MARCS model atmospheres for S-type stars.

We present a novel technique to reconstruct\nthe scattered flux of the pulsar and solve for the scattering geometry in these\ncases by combining interferometric visibilities with cross-correlations of\nsingle-station intensities. This takes advantage of the fact that, considering\na single image pair in delay-delay rate space, the visibilities are sensitive\nto the sum of the image angular displacements, while the cross-correlated\nintensities are sensitive to the difference, so that their combination can be\nused to localize both images of the pair.

Since\nthen, we have obtained a large number of ESPaDOnS and NARVAL Stokes $V$\nmeasurements allowing this survey to be completed. Here we present the results\nof our homogeneous analysis of the rotational periods (inferred from\nphotometric and magnetic variability) and magnetic properties (dipole field\nstrengths and obliquity angles) of the 52 confirmed mCP stars located within a\nheliocentric distance of $100\\,{\\rm pc}$. No mCP stars exhibiting field\nstrengths $\\lesssim300\\,{\\rm G}$ are found within the sample, which is\nconsistent with the notion that the magnetic desert is a real property and not\nthe result of an observational bias. Additionally, we find evidence of magnetic\nfield decay, which confirms the results of previous studies. \n\n"}

Here\nwe derive analytical solutions to the overshoot of the mid-transit depth caused\nby stellar limb darkening compared to the (R_p/R_s)^2 estimate for arbitrary\ntransit impact parameters. In turn, this allows us to compute the true\nplanet-to-star radius ratio from the transit depth for a given parameterization\nof a limb darkening law and for a known transit impact parameter. We calculate\nthe maximum emerging specific stellar intensity covered by the planet in\ntransit and derive analytic solutions for the transit depth overshoot.\nSolutions are presented for the linear, quadratic, square-root, logarithmic,\nand non-linear stellar limb darkening with arbitrary transit impact parameters.\nWe also derive formulae to calculate the average intensity along the transit\nchord, which allows us to estimate the actual transit depth (and therefore\nR_p/R_s) from the mean in-transit flux. The transit depth overshoot of\nexoplanets compared to the (R_p/R_s)^2 estimate increases from about 15% for A\nmain-sequence stars to roughly 20% for sun-like stars and some 30% for K and M\nstars.

However, the\nsystem is poorly characterized and needs more observations to be confirmed,\nwith the next potential transit in 2019 May. In this Letter, we aid\nobservational follow up by analyzing the transit signature of exomoons. We\nderive a simple analytic equation for the transit probability and use it to\ndemonstrate how exomoons may frequently avoid transit if their orbit is larger\nthan the stellar radius and sufficiently misaligned. The nominal orbit for the\nmoon in Kepler-1625 has both of these characteristics, and we calculate that it\nmay only transit roughly 40% of the time. This means that approximately six\nnon-transits would be required to rule out the moon's existence at 95%\nconfidence. When an exomoon's impact parameter is displaced off the star, the\nplanet's impact parameter is displaced the other way, so larger planet transit\ndurations are typically positively correlated with missed exomoon transits. On\nthe other hand, strong correlations do not exist between missed exomoon\ntransits and transit timing variations of the planet.

The effects of neutrino emission of all\nflavours are accounted for. The new EOS is noticeably stiffer than the\nLattimer-Swesty-EOS used in previous investigations. We find in general\nsomewhat lower temperatures than previous investigations. This allows a\nsubstantial fraction of heavy nuclei to be present even in the inner parts of\nthe torus that forms around the central object and yields important\ncontributions to the neutrino opacity. The central object shows a rapid\ndifferential rotation with periods of $\\sim$ 2ms, which we suspect to stabilize\nthe central object on (at least) the simulation time scale against\ngravitational collapse. The differential rotation could wind up initial\nmagnetic fields to $\\sim 10^17$ G. \n\n"}

However, there are still a lot of open questions regarding the\nstrength of the emission as well as the underlying emission mechanism.\nAccompanying the development of a LOFAR prototype station dedicated to the\nobservation of radio emission from extensive air showers, LOPES, we therefore\ntake a new approach to modeling the emission process, interpreting it as\n\"coherent geosynchrotron emission\" from electron-positron pairs gyrating in the\nearth's magnetic field.

LLAGN accretion\ndisks should thus co-exist with thousands to millions of stars or proto-stars\nleft from the previous stronger accretion activity. In principle, these stars\nmay produce several important effects: (i) contribute to the optical/UV spectra\nof some LLAGN; (ii) reprocessing of the stellar radiation in the dusty disks\ncould dominate the LLAGN infra-red spectra; (iii) deplete the (accretion) gas\ndisk much faster than it can accrete onto the supper-massive black hole (SMBH);\n(iv) stars, individually or in groups, may slow down and modulate the accretion\nflow significantly due to their inertia. In this way they may produce the LLAGN\ncut-off disks; (v) alternatively, frequent enough stellar collisions and\nresulting stellar disruptions could keep the inner disk empty.

In the\nabsence of any selection effects, the damped Lyman-alpha absorbers (DLAs) in\nquasar spectra are expected to show such a rise in global metallicity.

In an attempt to put tighter constraints on the low-redshift end\nof the DLA metallicity-redshift relation, we have observed Zn II and Cr II\nlines in four DLAs at $0.09 < z < 0.52$, using the Space Telescope Imaging\nSpectrograph (STIS) onboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST).

Abstract: Double neutron stars (DNSs), binary systems consisting of a radio pulsar and\na generally undetected second neutron star (NS), have proven to be excellent\nlaboratories for testing the theory of general relativity. The seven systems\ndiscovered in our Galaxy exhibit a remarkably well-defined relation between the\npulsar spin period and the orbital eccentricity. Here we show, using a simple\nmodel where the pulsar is spun up by mass transfer from a helium-star\ncompanion, that this relation can only be produced if the second neutron star\nreceived a kick that is substantially smaller (with a velocity dispersion of\nless than 50 km/s) than the standard kick received by a single radio pulsar.\nThis demonstrates that the kick mechanism depends on the evolutionary history\nof the NS progenitor and that the orbital parameters of DNSs are completely\ndetermined by the evolution in the preceding helium star - neutron star phase.\nThis has important implications for estimating the rates of NS-NS mergers, one\nof the major potential astrophysical sources for the direct detection of\ngravitational waves, and for short-period gamma-ray bursts. \n\n"}

These two objects are\noriginally selected as i'-dropouts (i'-z' > 1.5) showing an interesting\nphotometric property, the ``NB921 depression''. The NB921-band (centered at\n9196A) magnitude is significantly depressed with respect to the z'-band\nmagnitude. The optical spectra of these two objects exhibit asymmetric\nemission-lines at lambda_obs ~ 8540A and ~ 8560A, suggesting that these objects\nare Ly_alpha emitters at z~6. The rest-frame equivalent widths of the Ly_alpha\nemission of the two objects are 94A and 236A; the latter one is the Ly_alpha\nemitter with the largest Ly_alpha equivalent width at z > 6 ever\nspectroscopically confirmed. The spectroscopically measured Ly_alpha fluxes of\nthese two objects are consistent with the interpretation that the NB921\ndepression is caused by the contribution of the strong Ly_alpha emission to the\nz'-band flux. Most of the NB921-depressed i'-dropout objects are thought to be\nstrong Ly_alpha emitters at 6.0 < z < 6.5; Galactic L and T dwarfs and\nNB921-dropout galaxies at z > 6.6 do not dominate the NB921-depressed\ni'-dropout sample. Thus the NB921-depression method is very useful for finding\nhigh-z Ly_alpha emitters with a large Ly_alpha equivalent width over a large\nredshift range, 6.0 < z < 6.5. Although the broadband-selected sample at z ~ 3\ncontains only a small fraction of objects with a Ly_alpha equivalent width\nlarger than 100A, the i'-dropout sample of the Subaru Deep Field contains a\nmuch larger fraction of such strong Ly_alpha emitters.

Comparison of the\ndistribution of M31 and Galactic satellites relative to the galactic disks\nsuggests that the Galactic system is probably modestly incomplete at low\nlatitudes by ~20%. We find that the radial distribution of satellites around\nM31 is more extended than the Galactic subgroup; 50% of the Galactic satellites\nare found within ~100kpc of the Galaxy, compared to ~200kpc for M31.

We estimate that the globular cluster lies at a\ntotal distance of 175+/-55 kpc from M31, making it the farthest M31 globular\ncluster known. It also shows the typical characteristics of a bright globular\ncluster, with a half-light radius of 2.3+/-0.2 pc and an absolute magnitude in\nthe V band of M_{V,0}=-8.5+/-0.3 and contains a very old population with a\nmetallicity of [Fe/H]~-1.3. The three dwarf galaxies are all very faint, with\nabsolute magnitudes in the range -7.3<M_{V,0}<-6.4, and show strikingly similar\ncharacteristics with metallicities of [Fe/H]~-1.4 and half-light radii of\n\\~120+/-45 pc, making these dwarf galaxies two to three times smaller than the\nsmallest previously known satellites of M31.

Initial conditions of inflationary\n  perturbations Abstract: We investigate the issue of initial conditions of curvature and tensor\nperturba- tions at the beginning of slow roll inflation and their effect on the\npower spectra. Renormalizability and small back reaction constrain the high k\nbehavior of the Bogoliubov coefficients that define these initial conditions.We\nintroduce a transfer function D(k) which encodes the effect of generic initial\nconditions on the power spectra. The constraint from renormalizability and\nsmall back reaction entails that D(k) < mu^2/k^2 for large k, implying that\nobservable effects from initial conditions are more prominent in the low\nmultipoles. This behavior affects the CMB quadrupole by the observed amount\n\\~10-20% when mu is of the order of the energy scale of inflation. The effects\non high l-multipoles are suppressed by a factor ~1/l^2 due to the fall off of\nD(k) for large wavevectors k. We show that the determination of generic initial\nconditions for the fluc- tuations is equivalent to the scattering problem by a\npotential V(eta) localized just prior to the slow roll stage. Such potential\nleads to a transfer function D(k) which automatically obeys the\nrenormalizability and small backreaction constraints.

The binary nature of #11 was discovered first by Allers (2005) and\nindependently here during which we obtained the first spatially resolved R~2000\nnear-infrared (J & K) spectra, mid-IR photometry, and orbital motion estimates.\nWe estimate for 11A and 11B gravities (log(g)>3.75), ages (5+/-2 Myr),\nluminosities (log(L/Lsun)=-2.77+/-0.10 and -2.96+/-0.10), and temperatures\n(Teff=2375+/-175 and 2175+/-175 K). We find self-consistent DUSTY evolutionary\nmodel (Chabrier et al. 2000) masses of 17+4-5 MJup and 14+6-5 MJup, for 11A and\n11B respectively. Our masses are higher than those previously reported (13-15\nMJup and 7-8 MJup) by Jayawardhana & Ivanov (2006b). Hence, we find the system\nis unlikely a ``planetary mass binary'', (in agreement with Luhman et al. 2007)\nbut it has the second lowest mass and lowest binding energy of any known\nbinary. Oph #11 and Oph #16 belong to a newly recognized population of wide\n(>100 AU), young (<10 Myr), roughly equal mass, VLM stellar and brown dwarf\nbinaries.

We show that\nthe analytic (single layer, thin shell) solution is a good approximation when\nthe momentum flux is anisotropic, fails for a steep ISM density gradient, and\nap- proaches the numerical solution for efficient cooling.

The\nforward-shock synchrotron emission from a very narrow jet (half-angle less than\n1 deg) is consistent with the decay of 75 percent of GRB tails. The\nforward-shock inverse-Compton emission from a narrow jet that does not expand\nsideways also accommodates the decay of 80 percent of GRB tails.\n  The X-ray light-curve hump can be attributed to an increasing kinetic energy\nper solid angle of the forward-shock region visible to the observer. This\nincrease could be due to the emergence of the emission from an outflow seen\nfrom a location outside its opening. However, the correlations among the hump\ntiming, flux, and decay index expected in this model are not confirmed by\nobservations.

We investigate methods of achieving the\nobserved variability using symmetry. Since our model emphasizes geometric and\nstatistical considerations, rather than the detailed physics of the shell, it\nis applicable to any theory that relies on relativistic shells.

Advantage of using\nprimordial gravitational waves to probe extra dimensions is that their theory\ndepends only on the geometry, not on the microscopic models of inflation and\nstabilization. D(D-3)/2 degrees of freedom of the free bulk gravitons are\nprojected onto the 3d brane as tensor, vector and scalar modes. We found the\nfollowing no-go results for a generic geometry of a five (or D) dimensional\nwarped metric with four dimensional de Sitter (inflationary) slices and two (or\none) edge of the world branes: Massive KK graviton modes are not generated from\ninflation (with the Hubble parameter H) due to the gap in the KK spectrum; the\nuniversal lower bound on the gap is sqrt{3/2} H. Massless scalar and vector\nprojections of the bulk gravitons are absent, unlike in geometries with KK\ncompactification.\n  A massless 4d tensor mode is generated from inflation with the amplitude\nH/M_P, where M_P is the effective Planck mass during inflation, derived from\nthe D dimensional fundamental mass M_S and the volume of the inner dimensions.\nHowever, M_P for a curved dS braneworld may differ from that of the flat brane\nat low energies, either due to the H-dependence of the inner space volume or\nvariations in the brane separation before stabilization. Thus the amplitude of\ngravitational waves from inflation in braneworld cosmology may be different\nfrom that predicted by inflation in 4d theory. \n\n"}
