We argue that the low energy relations representing the\nquantum anomalies of QCD are saturated by coherent low dimensional vacuum\nconfigurations as observed in Monte Carlo lattice studies. The thermal spectrum\nand approximate universality of the temperature with no dependence on energy of\ncolliding particles in this framework is due to the fact that the emission\nresults from the distortion of these low dimensional vacuum sheets rather than\nfrom the colliding particles themselves. The emergence of the long- range\ncorrelations of P odd domains (a feature which is apparently required for\nexplanation of the asymmetry observed at RHIC and LHC) is also a result of the\nsame distortion of the QCD vacuum configurations.

Since the\nstudy is mainly on the hadronization of partons at late time, the fluid picture\nis not used to trace the evolution of the system. The inclusive distributions\nat low $p_T$ are determined as the recombination products of thermal partons.\nThe $p_T$ dependencies of both pion and proton have a common exponential factor\napart from other dissimilar kinematic and resonance factors, because they are\ninherited from the same pool of thermal partons. Instead of the usual\ndescription based on hydrodynamics, the azimuthal anisotropy of the produced\nhadrons is explained as the consequence of the effects of minijets, either\nindirectly through the recombination of enhanced thermal partons in the\nvicinity of the trajectories of the semihard partons, or directly through\nthermal-shower recombination. Although our investigation is focussed on the\nsingle-particle distribution at midrapidity, we give reasons why a component in\nthat distribution can be identified with the ridge, which together with the\nsecond harmonic $v_2$ is due to the semihard partons created near the medium\nsurface that lead to calculable anisotropy in $\\phi$. It is shown that the\nhigher azimuthal harmonics, $v_n$, can also be well reproduced without\nreference to flow.

The transition is studied using the Polyakov loop model, with\nthe initial field configuration (in the confining phase) covering a small\nneighborhood of the confining vacuum $l \\simeq 0$, as appropriate for $T <\nT_c$. Quench is implemented by evolving this initial configuration with the\neffective potential at a temperature $T > T_c$. We study the formation of Z(3)\ndomain structure and its evolution during the transition as $l$ rolls down in\ndifferent directions from the top of the central hill in the effective\npotential of $l$. When explicit Z(3) symmetry breaking effects (arising from\ndynamical quark effects) are small, then we find well defined Z(3) domains\nwhich coarsen in time. Remarkably, the magnitude plot of $l$ shows vacuum\nbubble like configurations arising during the quench. This first order\ntransition like behavior occurs even though there is no metastable vacuum\nseparated by a barrier from the true vacuum for the parameter values used. When\nthe initial field configuration everywhere rolls down roughly along the same\ndirection (as will happen with large explicit symmetry breaking) then we do not\nfind such bubble-like configurations.

In\nthis paper, we make several suggestions to try to clarify the role of new\nphysics in these results. We propose that the enhancement needed in the\nStandard Model to attribute the observed CP violation in D to two pseudoscalar\nmodes may not operate for inclusive final states where asymmetries will likely\napproximate the quark level expectation. Experimentally testing this principle\nrequires a search for CP asymmetries in final states containing K and K-bar\nwith a total energy of less than M_D. We also propose that CP asymmetries may\nbe enhanced in modes where the tree is color suppressed. In particular, the\nfinal state rho0 rho0 is of special interest; similarly Ds-> rho0 K+ and rho0\nK*+ likewise appear interesting. We discuss how isospin symmetry yields\nobservables sensitive to certain classes of new physics and suppressed in the\nStandard Model. Some modes considered in this context are D-> pi pi, rho pi,\nrho rho as well as Ds-> K* pi. We also consider how such analysis may\neventually be supplemented by information about the weak phases in D0 decay. In\norder to obtain this information experimentally, we consider various methods\nfor preparing an initial state which is a quantum mechanical mixture of D0 and\nD0-bar. This may be done through the use of natural D0 D0-bar oscillations;\nobserving D0-mesons which arise from Bd or Bs mesons which themselves are\noscillating or from quantum correlations in D0 pairs which arise from either\npsi\" decay or B-meson decay. Observing CP violation in the magnitudes of decay\namplitudes should be within the capability of experiments in the near future\nhowever obtaining the weak phases through the methods we discuss will likely\nrequire future generations of machines. \n\n"}

We put forward a hypothesis that the physical\nUniverse includes a quantum environment that interacts with particle scattering\nprocesses. While the scattering process is governed by the S-matrix the\ninteraction evolves the produced state rho_f(S) to observed state rho_f(O). To\nbe consistent with the Standard Model this new interaction must be a pure\ndephasing interaction governed by a non-unitary evolution law modifying the\nphases of the amplitudes. We present the first test of the unitary evolution\nlaw in particle scattering. The unitary evolution law evolves pure initial\nstates into pure final states in exclusive processes. This fact leads to 9\nindependent constraints on 16 components of angular intensities in piN->pipiN\nprocesses. When expressed in terms of P-parity conserving transversity\namplitudes all 9 constraints are identities provided a single constrain on the\ntransversity amplitudes holds true.

These low $p_{T}$ photons have a large\nazimuthal anisotropy, $v_{2}$.

This production mechanism will generate photons that\nfollow constituent quark number, $n_{q}$, scaling of $v_{2}$ with an $n_{q}$\nvalue of two for direct photons. $\\chi^{2}$ comparisons of the published PHENIX\ndirect photon and identified particle $v_{2}$ measurements finds that\n$n_{q}$-scaling applied to the direct photon $v_{2}$ data prefers the value\n$n_{q}=1.8$ and agrees with $n_{q}=2$ within errors in most cases.

This might be the evidence which reveals new physics\nbeyond the Standard Model. In this paper, we consider models with a $750$ GeV\nscalar and vector-like particles, which couple each other through Yukawa\ncouplings. The diphoton decay of the scalar is enhanced by the loop diagrams\ninvolving the extra colored particles. We investigate not only the setup\nrequired by the excesses, but also the LHC constraints, especially concerned\nwith the vector-like particles. We consider the scenario that the extra colored\nparticles decay to quarks and a dark matter (DM) via Yukawa couplings. Then,\nthe signals from the vector-like particles are dijet, $b\\overline{b}$ and/or\n$t\\overline{t}$ with large missing energy. We discuss two possibilities for the\nsetups: One is a model with vector-like fermions and a scalar DM, and the other\nis a model with vector-like scalars and a fermionic DM.

Instead, chipmakers have been\npushed into producing lower-power, multi-core processors such as GPGPU, ARM and\nIntel MIC. Broad-based efforts from manufacturers and developers have been\ndevoted to making these processors user-friendly enough to perform general\ncomputations. However, extracting performance from a larger number of cores, as\nwell as specialized vector or SIMD units, requires special care in algorithm\ndesign and code optimization. One of the most computationally challenging\nproblems in high-energy particle experiments is finding and fitting the\ncharged-particle tracks during event reconstruction. This is expected to become\nby far the dominant problem in the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider\n(HL-LHC), for example. Today the most common track finding methods are those\nbased on the Kalman filter. Experience with Kalman techniques on real tracking\ndetector systems has shown that they are robust and provide high physics\nperformance. This is why they are currently in use at the LHC, both in the\ntrigger and offline. Previously we reported on the significant parallel\nspeedups that resulted from our investigations to adapt Kalman filters to track\nfitting and track building on Intel Xeon and Xeon Phi. Here, we discuss our\nprogresses toward the understanding of these processors and the new\ndevelopments to port Kalman filter to NVIDIA GPUs. \n\n"}

To find functional forms\nthat will allow for a robust extraction of the input radius for a wide variety\nof functional forms in order to have confidence in the extraction from upcoming\nlow $Q^2$ experimental data such as the Jefferson Lab PRad experiment, we\ncreate a general framework for inputting form-factor functions as well as\nvarious fitting functions.

In many HEP\nresearches, great efforts are made to increase the signal significance with the\npresence of huge background and various systematical uncertainties. Why not\ndevelop a BDT method targeting the significance directly? Indeed, the\nsignificance plays a central role in this new method. It is used to split a\nnode in building a tree and to be also the weight contributing to the BDT\nscore. As the systematical uncertainties can be easily included in the\nsignificance calculation, this method is able to learn about reducing the\neffect of the systematical uncertainties via training. Taking the search of the\nrare radiative Higgs decay in proton-proton collisions $pp \\to h + X \\to\n\\gamma\\tau^+\\tau^-+X$ as example, QBDT and the popular Gradient BDT (GradBDT)\nmethod are compared. QBDT is found to reduce the correlation between the signal\nstrength and systematical uncertainty sources and thus to give a better\nsignificance. The contribution to the signal strength uncertainty from the\nsystematical uncertainty sources using the new method is 50-85~\\% of that using\nthe GradBDT method. \n\n"}

We show\nthat such events even for minimal GZK neutrino fluxes could be detected by\nspace telescopes such as the EUSO project. These Horizontal Tau Showers will\ntrack very long fan-like, multi-finger showers whose signature would be\nrevealed by EUSO, OWL experiments. Moreover the additional imprint of their\nyoung secondaries muon, electron pairs and gamma bundles flashes might allow to\ndisentangle their nature from the older UHECR secondaries in horizontal\nshowers. Indeed at large zenith angles, the muon, electron pairs and gamma\nnumber for far and old Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays, becomes comparable. On\nthe contrary up-ward muon bundles from UpTaus and HorTaus (as well as by\nanti-neutrino electron + electron resonance at Glashow peak) may arise within a\nyoung shower with a gamma-muon ratio as large as 10^2.

{"id": "astro-ph/9811350", "contents": "Title: Can a supernova be located by its neutrinos? Abstract: A future core-collapse supernova in our Galaxy will be detected by several\nneutrino detectors around the world. The neutrinos escape from the supernova\ncore over several seconds from the time of collapse, unlike the electromagnetic\nradiation, emitted from the envelope, which is delayed by a time of order\nhours. In addition, the electromagnetic radiation can be obscured by dust in\nthe intervening interstellar space. The question therefore arises whether a\nsupernova can be located by its neutrinos alone. The early warning of a\nsupernova and its location might allow greatly improved astronomical\nobservations. The theme of the present work is a careful and realistic\nassessment of this question, taking into account the statistical significance\nof the various neutrino signals. Not surprisingly, neutrino-electron forward\nscattering leads to a good determination of the supernova direction, even in\nthe presence of the large and nearly isotropic background from other reactions.\nEven with the most pessimistic background assumptions, SuperKamiokande (SK) and\nthe Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) can restrict the supernova direction to\nbe within circles of radius $5^\\circ$ and $20^\\circ$, respectively. Other\nreactions with more events but weaker angular dependence are much less useful\nfor locating the supernova. Finally, there is the oft-discussed possibility of\ntriangulation, i.e., determination of the supernova direction based on an\narrival time delay between different detectors. Given the expected statistics\nwe show that, contrary to previous estimates, this technique does not allow a\ngood determination of the supernova direction. \n\n"}

Abstract: It has recently been suggested that the parity doublet structure seen in the\nspectrum of highly excited baryons may be due to effective chiral symmetry\nrestoration for these states. We review the recent developments in this field.\nWe demonstrate with a simple quantum-mechanical example that it is a very\nnatural property of quantum systems that a symmetry breaking effect which is\nimportant for the low-lying spectrum of the system, can become unimportant for\nthe highly-lying states; the highly lying states reveal a multiplet structure\nof nearly degenerate states. Using the well established concepts of\nquark-hadron duality, asymptotic freedom in QCD and validity of the operator\nproduct expansion in QCD we show that the spectral densities obtained with the\nlocal currents that are connected to each other via chiral transformations,\nvery high in the spectrum must coincide. Hence effects of spontaneous breaking\nof chiral symmetry in QCD vacuum that are crucially important for the low-lying\nspectra, become irrelevant for the highly-lying states. Then to the extent that\nidentifiable hadronic resonances still exist in the continuum spectrum at high\nexcitations this implies that the highly excited hadrons must fall into\nmultiplets associated with the representations of the chiral group.

We relate the\nlogarithms that appear in our formulation of pair production to logarithms that\nappear in the limit of collinear factorization in QCD. Violations of kT\nfactorization and medium modifications, as represented by the Cronin effect,\nare also investigated. We next consider how small x quantum evolution\n(shadowing) effects modify the results for pair production. In particular, we\nprovide results for the rapidity distribution of pairs and the dependence of\nthe Cronin effect on rapidity. We discuss the dependence of our results on the\ninitial conditions for small x evolution and comment on its implications for\npair production at RHIC and the LHC. \n\n"}

In\nparticular, we consider those parameters that have been inaccessible at\nprevious colliders, quartic gauge couplings. Within a generic effective-field\ntheory context we analyze all processes that contain quasi-elastic weak-boson\nscattering, using complete six-fermion matrix elements in unweighted event\nsamples, fast simulation of the ILC detector, and a multidimensional parameter\nfit of the set of anomalous couplings.

We supplement this by a similar new study of triple\nweak-boson production, which is sensitive to the same set of anomalous\ncouplings.

Within reggeon field theory,\neach color-excited nucleon is associated with the unitarity cut of the pomeron\nexchanged between the projectile and nucleus. In this communication we derive\nthe unitarity rules for the multiplicity of excited nucleons, alias cut\npomerons, alias topological cross sections, for typical hard dijet production\nprocesses. We demonstrate how the coupled-channel non-Abelian intranuclear\nevolution of color dipoles, inherent to pQCD, gives rise to the reggeon field\ntheory diagrams for final states in terms of the uncut, and two kinds of cut,\npomerons. Upon the proper identification of the uncut and cut pomeron\nexchanges, the topological cross sections for dijet production follow in a\nstraightforward way from the earlier derived nonlinear k_t - factorization\nquadratures for the inclusive dijet cross sections. The concept of a coherent\n(collective) nuclear glue proves extremely useful for the formulation of\nreggeon field theory vertices of multipomeron - cut and uncut - couplings to\nparticles and between themselves. A departure of our unitarity cutting rules\nfrom the ones suggested by the pre-QCD Abramovsky-Kancheli-Gribov rules, stems\nfrom the coupled-channel features of intranuclear pQCD. We propose a\nmultiplicity re-summation as a tool for the isolation of topological cross\nsections for single-jet production. \n\n"}

Parity violation arises from the interference of electromagnetic and\nweak neutral amplitudes, and the $Z^0$ of the Standard Model couples primarily\nto neutrons at low $Q^2$. The data can be interpreted with as much confidence\nas electromagnetic scattering. After briefly reviewing the present theoretical\nand experimental knowledge of neutron densities, we discuss possible parity\nviolation measurements, their theoretical interpretation, and applications. The\nexperiments are feasible at existing facilities. We show that theoretical\ncorrections are either small or well understood, which makes the interpretation\nclean. The quantitative relationship to atomic parity nonconservation\nobservables is examined, and we show that the electron scattering asymmetries\ncan be directly applied to atomic PNC because the observables have\napproximately the same dependence on nuclear shape. \n\n"}
