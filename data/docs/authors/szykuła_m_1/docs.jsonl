The wavelength dependence of our intrinsic polarization data\nprovides a diagnostic of the dominant and any secondary polarigenic agents\npresent, enabling us to discriminate pure gas disk systems, i.e. classical Be\nstars, from composite gas plus dust disk systems, i.e. Herbig Ae/Be or B[e]\nstars. Our intrinsic polarization results, along with available near-IR color\ninformation, strongly supports the suggestion of Wisniewski et al. that\nclassical Be stars are present in clusters of age 5-8 Myr, and contradict\nassertions that the Be phenomenon only develops in the second half of a B\nstar's main sequence lifetime, i.e. no earlier than 10 Myr.\n  Comparing the polarimetric properties of our dataset to a similar survey of\nGalactic classical Be stars, we find that the prevalence of polarimetric Balmer\njump signatures decreases with metallicity.

However, planet formation in such close\nbinary systems is a challenge to current theory. One of the major theoretical\nproblems occurs in the intermediate stage-planetesimals accretion into\nplanetary embryos-during which the companion's perturbations can stir up the\nrelative velocites(dV) of planetesimals and thus slow down or even cease their\ngrowth. However, all previous studies assumed a 2-dimentional (2D) disk and a\ncoplanar binary orbit. Extending previous studies by including a 3D gas disk\nand an inclined binary orbit with small relative inclination of i_B=0.1-5 deg,\nwe numerically investigate the conditions for planetesimal accretion at 1-2 AU,\nan extension of the habitable zone(1-1.3 AU), around alpha Centauri A in this\npaper. Inclusion of the binary inclination leads to: (1) differential orbital\nphasing is realized in the 3D space, and thus different-sized bodies are\nseparated from each other; (2) total impact rate becomes lower, and impacts\nmainly occur between similar-sized bodies; (3) accretion is more favored, but\nthe balance between accretion and erosion remains uncertain, and the \"possible\naccretion region\" extends up to 2AU when assuming an optimistic Q*(critical\nspecific energy that leads to catastrophic fragmentation); and (4) impact\nvelocities (dV) are significantly reduced but still much larger than their\nescape velocities, which infers that planetesimals grow by means of type II\nrunaway mode.

The\nmonitorability of an omega-regular language, L, is thus a property that holds,\nif for any finite word u, observed so far, it is possible to add another finite\nword v, such that uv becomes a \"finite witness\" wrt.

The characterized SSPE is\nstationary when re-entry in the auction is allowed, and it is Markov perfect\nwhen re-entry is forbidden. Furthermore, we fully characterize the expected\nrevenue of the seller. Generally, with or without re-entry, it is more\nbeneficial for the seller to choose $v$ (value of the object), $s$ (sale\nprice), and $c$ (bidding fee) such that $\\frac{v-s}{c}$ becomes sufficiently\nlarge.

Among other results, we show that computing the cycle\nrank is NP-complete, even for sparse digraphs of maximum outdegree 2.\nNotwithstanding, we provide both a polynomial-time approximation algorithm and\nan exponential-time exact algorithm for this problem. The former algorithm\nyields an O((log n)^(3/2))- approximation in polynomial time, whereas the\nlatter yields the optimum solution, and runs in time and space O*(1.9129^n) on\ndigraphs of maximum outdegree at most two. Regarding the star height problem,\nwe identify a subclass of the regular languages for which we can precisely\ndetermine the computational complexity of the star height problem. Namely, the\nstar height problem for bideterministic languages is NP-complete, and this\nholds already for binary alphabets. Then we translate the algorithmic results\nconcerning cycle rank to the bideterministic star height problem, thus giving a\npolynomial-time approximation as well as a reasonably fast exact exponential\nalgorithm for bideterministic star height. \n\n"}

In this\npaper, we investigate the decidability and the complexity of this problem under\nthe assumption of bounded context-switching defined by Qadeer and Rehof, and of\nphase-boundedness proposed by La Torre et al. On the model checking of such\nsystems against temporal logics and in particular branching time logics such as\nthe modal $\\mu$-calculus or CTL has received little attention. It is known that\nparity games, which are closely related to the modal $\\mu$-calculus, are\ndecidable for the class of bounded-phase systems (and hence for bounded-context\nswitching as well), but with non-elementary complexity (Seth).

Many solutions to this problem\nhave been proposed, including restricting the type of weights used and\nemploying a different valuation function that forces convergence. In this paper\nwe describe an alternative approach that, rather than seeking to avoid the\ninevitable divergences, instead embraces them as a source of useful\ninformation. Specifically, rather than taking coefficients from an arbitrary\nsemiring S we instead take them from S^N. Doing this is useful because it gives\nus information about how the weight of an infinite word does or does not\ndiverge, and if it does diverge what form the divergence takes --- e.g.,\npolynomial, exponential, etc. This approach has proved to be incredibly useful\nin the field of quantum simulation because when studying infinite systems,\ninformation about how quantities of interest, such as energy or magnetization,\ndiverge is exactly what we want.\n  In this paper we introduce a new kind of automaton which we call a diverging\nautomaton that maps infinite words to sequences of weights from a semiring and\nwhich employs a Buchi-like boundary condition. We then develop a theory for\ndiverging power series and prove a Kleene Theorem connecting rational diverging\npower series to diverging automata. Afterward we repeat this process by\nintroducing bidiverging automata which map biinfinite words to elements in S^(Z\nx N), developing a theory for bidiverging power series, and proving another\nKleene Theorem.

As a natural restriction of NP-reducibility, we introduce a notion\nof many-one CFL reducibility and conduct a ground work to formulate a coherent\nframework for further expositions. Two more powerful reducibilities--bounded\ntruth-table and Turing CFL-reducibilities--are also discussed in comparison.\nThe Turing CFL-reducibility, in particular, helps us introduce an exquisite\nhierarchy, called the CFL hierarchy, built over the family CFL of context-free\nlanguages. For each level of this hierarchy, its basic structural properties\nare proven and three alternative characterizations are presented. The second\nlevel is not included in NC(2) unless NP= NC(2). The first and second levels of\nthe hierarchy are different. The rest of the hierarchy (more strongly, the\nBoolean hierarchy built over each level of the hierarchy) is also infinite\nunless the polynomial hierarchy over NP collapses.

In some cases,\nthese networks may have multiple kinds of interactions, such as distinct types\nof social ties or distinct types of financial liabilities; furthermore, nodes\nmay respond in different ways to in influence from their neighbors of multiple\ntypes. To start to capture such settings in a stylized way, we generalize a\nthreshold cascade model to a multiplex network in which nodes follow one of two\nresponse rules: some nodes activate when, in at least one layer, a large enough\nfraction of neighbors are active, while the other nodes activate when, in all\nlayers, a large enough fraction of neighbors are active. Varying the fractions\nof nodes following either rule facilitates or inhibits cascades. Near the\ninhibition regime, global cascades appear discontinuously as the network\ndensity increases; however, the cascade grows more slowly over time. This\nbehavior suggests a way in which various collective phenomena in the real world\ncould appear abruptly yet slowly. \n\n"}

Here we\nfocus on state complexity of classical automata for promise problems. First, it\nwas known that there is a family of unary promise problems solvable by quantum\nautomata by using a single qubit, but the number of states required by\ncorresponding one-way deterministic automata cannot be bounded by a constant.\nFor this family, we show that even two-way nondeterminism does not help to save\na single state. By comparing this with the corresponding state complexity of\nalternating machines, we then get a tight exponential gap between two-way\nnondeterministic and one-way alternating automata solving unary promise\nproblems. Second, despite of the existing quadratic gap between Las Vegas\nrealtime probabilistic automata and one-way deterministic automata for language\nrecognition, we show that, by turning to promise problems, the tight gap\nbecomes exponential. Last, we show that the situation is different for one-way\nprobabilistic automata with two-sided bounded-error. We present a family of\nunary promise problems that is very easy for these machines; solvable with only\ntwo states, but the number of states in two-way alternating or any simpler\nautomata is not limited by a constant. Moreover, we show that one-way\nbounded-error probabilistic automata can solve promise problems not solvable at\nall by any other classical model. \n\n"}

Such complexity properties are undecidable for a Turing-complete\nprogramming language, and a common work-around in program analysis is to settle\nfor sound but incomplete solutions. In contrast, we consider a class of\nprograms that is Turing-incomplete, but strong enough to include several\nchallenges for this kind of analysis. For a related language that has\nwell-structured syntax, similar to Meyer and Ritchie's LOOP programs, the\nproblem has been previously proved to be decidable. The analysis relied on the\ncompositionality of programs, hence the challenge in obtaining similar results\nfor flowchart programs with arbitrary control-flow graphs. Our answer to the\nchallenge is twofold: first, we propose a class of loop-annotated flowcharts,\nwhich is more general than the class of flowcharts that directly represent\nstructured programs; secondly, we present a technique to reuse the ideas from\nthe work on tructured programs and apply them to such flowcharts.

Correctness of an\nimplementation object is defined in terms of a corresponding abstract\nspecification. This gives rise to two important verification questions:\nmembership (checking whether a behaviour of the implementation is allowed by\nthe specification) and correctness (checking whether all behaviours of the\nimplementation are allowed by the specification). In this paper, we show that\nthe membership problem for quiescent consistency is NP-complete and that the\ncorrectness problem is decidable, but coNP-hard and in EXPSPACE. For both\nproblems, we consider restricted versions of quiescent consistency by assuming\nan upper limit on the number of events between two quiescent points. Here, we\nshow that the membership problem is in PTIME, whereas correctness is in PSPACE.\n  Quiescent consistency does not guarantee sequential consistency, i.e., it\nallows operation calls by the same process to be reordered when mapping to an\nabstract specification. Therefore, we also consider quiescent sequential\nconsistency, which strengthens quiescent consistency with an additional\nsequential consistency condition. We show that the unrestricted versions of\nmembership and correctness are NP-complete and undecidable, respectively. When\nby placing a limit on the number of events between two quiescent points,\nmembership is in PTIME, while correctness is in PSPACE.

Examples of complex specifications of interest include\nproperties expressed as formulae in linear temporal logic (LTL) or as automata\non infinite strings. A general methodology to synthesize controllers for such\nproperties resorts to symbolic abstractions of the given stochastic systems.\nSymbolic models are discrete abstractions of the given concrete systems with\nthe property that a controller designed on the abstraction can be refined (or\nimplemented) into a controller on the original system. Although the recent\ndevelopment of techniques for the construction of symbolic models has been\nquite encouraging, the general goal of formal synthesis over stochastic control\nsystems is by no means solved. A fundamental issue with the existing techniques\nis the known \"curse of dimensionality,\" which is due to the need to discretize\nstate and input sets and that results in an exponential complexity over the\nnumber of state and input variables in the concrete system.

Therefore, we suggest a unique perspective on this central\nissue, to which we would like to refer as to transparent connectionism, by\nproposing accounts of how symbolic computation can be implemented in neural\nsubstrates. In this study we first introduce a new model of dynamics on a\nsymbolic space, the versatile shift, showing that it supports the real-time\nsimulation of a range of automata. We then show that the Goedelization of\nversatile shifts defines nonlinear dynamical automata, dynamical systems\nevolving on a vectorial space.

Typically, obtaining an\nalgorithm for separation yields a deep understanding of the investigated class\nC. This explains why a lot of effort has been devoted to finding algorithms for\nthe most prominent classes.\n  Here, we are interested in classes within concatenation hierarchies. Such\nhierarchies are built using a generic construction process: one starts from an\ninitial class called the basis and builds new levels by applying generic\noperations. The most famous one, the dot-depth hierarchy of Brzozowski and\nCohen, classifies the languages definable in first-order logic. Moreover, it\nwas shown by Thomas that it corresponds to the quantifier alternation hierarchy\nof first-order logic: each level in the dot-depth corresponds to the languages\nthat can be defined with a prescribed number of quantifier blocks. Finding\nseparation algorithms for all levels in this hierarchy is among the most famous\nopen problems in automata theory.\n  Our main theorem is generic: we show that separation is decidable for the\nlevel 3/2 of any concatenation hierarchy whose basis is finite.

The\nmain reason behind this is that defining formal semantics for a CER language is\nnot trivial: they usually combine first-order variables for joining and\nfiltering events with regular operators like sequencing and Kleene closure.\nMoreover, their semantics usually focus only on the detection of complex\nevents, leaving the concept of output mostly unattended.\n  In this paper, we propose to unify the semantics and output of complex event\nrecognition languages by using second order objects. Specifically, we introduce\na CER language called Second Order Complex Event Logic (SO-CEL for short), that\nuses second order variables for managing and outputting sequences of events.\nThis makes the definition of the main CER operators simple, allowing us to\ndevelop the first steps in understanding its expressive power.

RMA extend the expressive power of symbolic\nautomata, by allowing formulas to be applied not only to the last element read\nfrom the input string, but to multiple elements, stored in their registers. RMA\nalso extend register automata, by allowing arbitrary formulas, besides equality\npredicates. We study the closure properties of RMA under union, concatenation,\nKleene+, complement and determinization and show that RMA, contrary to symbolic\nautomata, are not determinizable when viewed as recognizers, without taking the\noutput of transitions into account. However, when a window operator, a\nquintessential feature in Complex Event Processing, is used, RMA are indeed\ndeterminizable even when viewed as recognizers.

This study takes a first\nstep toward formally devising an architecture composed of task planning and\ncontrol of whole-body dynamic locomotion behaviors in constrained and\ndynamically changing environments.

These locomotion actions satisfy the desired high-level task\nspecifications expressed in a fragment of temporal logic.

This definition is motivated by the question which {\\omega}-words\nadmit infinite orbits: for such a word, every prefix is expandable.\n  In this paper, we show that, on input of a word u, an automaton T and a\nnumber k, it is decidable to check whether u is k-expandable with respect to\nthe action of T.

A recent breakthrough was achieved by replacing\nmembership with a more general problem: separation. Given two input languages,\none has to decide whether there exists a third language in the investigated\nlevel containing the first language and disjoint from the second. The\nmotivation is that: (1) while more difficult, separation is more rewarding (2)\nit provides a more convenient framework (3) all recent membership algorithms\nare reductions to separation for lower levels.\n  We present a separation algorithm for dot-depth two.

Abstract: The widely accepted assumption is that metals detected in the spectra of a\nfew cool helium-rich white dwarfs cannot be of primordial origin and therefore\nmust be accreted from the interstellar medium. However, the observed abundances\nof hydrogen are much too low to be compatible with the high accretion rates\ninferred from metal accretion. Hydrogen accretion is therefore suppressed\ncompared to metal accretion. The hypothesis most widely discussed as cause for\nthis ``hydrogen screening'' is the propeller mechanism: Metals are accreted in\nthe form of grains onto a slowly rotating, weakly magnetized white dwarf,\nwhereas ionized hydrogen is repelled at the Alfv\\'en radius. We have obtained\ncircular polarization spectra of the helium-rich white dwarfs GD 40\n(WD0300-013) and L745-46A (WD0738-172) -- which both show strong metal lines as\nwell as hydrogen -- in order to search for signatures of a weak magnetic field.\nThe magnetic field strengths necessary for the propeller mechanism to work in\nthese stars are at least 144000 G and 3000 G, respectively. Whereas L745-46A\nmight have a magnetic field of about $-$6900 G no magnetic field could be found\nwith an upper limit for the field strength of 4000 G (with 99% confidence) for\nGD 40. \n\n"}

One difference between the two systems is that\nsuperfluid Helium exhibits roton excitations while Bose Einstein Condensates\nhave never been observed to have such excitations.

Similarly (as we show here) rotating stars of\nthis kind have no pure g-modes, no modes whose spherical limit is a\nperturbation with polar parity and vanishing perturbed pressure and density.\nWhere have these modes gone?\n  In spherical stars of this kind, r-modes and g-modes form a degenerate\nzero-frequency subspace. We find that rotation splits the degeneracy to zeroth\norder in the star's angular velocity $\\Omega$, and the resulting modes are\ngenerically hybrids, whose limit as $\\Omega\\to 0$ is a stationary current with\naxial and polar parts. Because each mode has definite parity, its axial and\npolar parts have alternating values of $l$.

We construct a sequence of dual descriptions of this theory\nusing the dualities of Seiberg combined with the ``deconfinement'' method\nintroduced by Berkooz.

We show that\nall such realizations have a common underlying feature, namely a dimensional\ntruncation of the charge lattice, and we identify such dimensional truncations\nwith certain irregular embeddings of higher-level and non-simply laced gauge\ngroups within level-one simply-laced gauge groups. This identification allows\nus to formulate a direct mapping between a given subgroup embedding, and the\nsorts of GSO constraints that are necessary in order to realize the embedding\nin string theory. This also allows us to determine a number of useful\nconstraints that generally affect string GUT model-building. For example, most\nstring GUT realizations of higher-level gauge symmetries G_k employ the\nso-called diagonal embeddings G_k\\subset G\\times G \\times...\\times G. We find\nthat there exist interesting alternative embeddings by which such groups can be\nrealized at higher levels, and we derive a complete list of all possibilities\nfor the GUT groups SU(5), SU(6), SO(10), and E_6 at levels k=2,3,4 (and in some\ncases up to k=7). We find that these new embeddings are always more efficient\nand require less central charge than the diagonal embeddings which have\ntraditionally been employed. As a byproduct, we also prove that it is\nimpossible to realize SO(10) at levels k>4. This implies, in particular, that\nfree-field heterotic string models can never give a massless 126 representation\nof SO(10). \n\n"}

The hamiltonians are defined and calculated\nusing creation and annihilation operators in light-front dynamics. The\nrenormalization group equations are written for a sequence of unitary\ntransformations which gradually transform the bare canonical creation and\nannihilation operators of a local theory to the creation and annihilation\noperators of effective particles in an effective theory with the same dynamical\ncontent but a finite range of energy transfers due to form factors in the\ninteraction vertices. The boost invariant effective hamiltonians can be used to\ndescribe the constituent dynamics in relativistically moving systems including\nthe rest and the infinite momentum frame. The general equations are illustrated\nin perturbation theory by second-order calculations of self-energy and\ntwo-particle interaction terms in Yukawa theory, QED and QCD. In Yukawa theory,\none obtains the generalized Yukawa potential including its full\noff-energy-shell extension and form factors in the vertices. In QED, the\neffective hamiltonian eigenvalue problem converges for small coupling constants\nto the Schr\\\"odinger equation but the typical relativistic ultraviolet\nsingularities at short distances between constituents are regularized by the\nsimilarity form factors.
