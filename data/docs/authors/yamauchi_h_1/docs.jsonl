Rime solutions include the standard\nDrinfeld-Jimbo R-matrix. Solutions of the Yang--Baxter equation within the rime\nAnsatz which are maximally different from the standard one we call \"strict\nrime\". A strict rime non-unitary solution is parameterized by a projective\nvector. We show that this solution transforms to the Cremmer-Gervais R-matrix\nby a change of basis with a matrix containing symmetric functions in the\ncomponents of the parameterizing vector. A strict unitary solution (the rime\nAnsatz is well adapted for taking a unitary limit) is shown to be equivalent to\na quantization of a classical \"boundary\" r-matrix of Gerstenhaber and\nGiaquinto. We analyze the structure of the elementary rime blocks and find, as\na by-product, that all non-standard R-matrices of GL(1|1)-type can be uniformly\ndescribed in a rime form.\n  We discuss then connections of the classical rime solutions with the Bezout\noperators. The Bezout operators satisfy the (non-)homogeneous associative\nclassical Yang--Baxter equation which is related to the Rota-Baxter operators.\n  We classify the rime Poisson brackets: they form a 3-dimensional pencil. A\nnormal form of each individual member of the pencil depends on the discriminant\nof a certain quadratic polynomial.

In particular,\nto every fusion category C we attach the 3-groupoid BrPic(C) of invertible\nC-bimodule categories, called the Brauer-Picard groupoid of C, such that\nequivalence classes of G-extensions of C are in bijection with homotopy classes\nof maps from BG to the classifying space of BrPic(C). This gives rise to an\nexplicit description of both the obstructions to existence of extensions and\nthe data parametrizing them; we work these out both topologically and\nalgebraically.\n  One of the central results of the paper is that the 2-truncation of BrPic(C)\nis canonically the 2-groupoid of braided autoequivalences of the Drinfeld\ncenter Z(C) of C. In particular, this implies that the Brauer-Picard group\nBrPic(C) (i.e., the group of equivalence classes of invertible C-bimodule\ncategories) is naturally isomorphic to the group of braided autoequivalences of\nZ(C). Thus, if C=Vec(A), where A is a finite abelian group, then BrPic(C) is\nthe orthogonal group O(A+A^*).

For T=1, J=0 pairing, partial waves beyond the standard\n1S0 channel play an interesting role for the pair formation in nuclei. The\nadditional contributions are dominated by the repulsive 3P1 partial wave. Their\neffects, and generally spin-triplet nuclear forces between paired nucleons, are\ninfluenced by the interplay of spin-orbit partners. We explore the impact of\nincluding partial waves beyond the 1S0 channel on neutron-neutron pairing gaps\nin semi-magic isotopic chains. In addition, we show that nuclear forces favor\nT=1, J=0 over T=0, J=1 pairing, except in low-j orbitals. This is in contrast\nto the free-space motivation that suggests the formation of deuteron-like T=0\npairs in N=Z nuclei. The suppression of T=0 pairing is because the 3S1 strength\nis distributed on spin-orbit partners and because of the effects of the\nrepulsive 1P1 channel and of D waves. \n\n"}

Spin has played an essential role\nand often brought surprises and puzzles to the investigation of the nucleon\nstructure and the strong interaction. New experimental data on nucleon spin\nstructure at low to intermediate momentum transfers combined with existing high\nmomentum transfer data offer a comprehensive picture in the strong region of\nthe interaction and of the transition region from the strong to the\nasymptotic-free region. Insight for some aspects of the theory for the strong\ninteraction, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), is gained by exploring lower moments\nof spin structure functions and their corresponding sum rules. These moments\nare expressed in terms of an operator-product expansion using quark and gluon\ndegrees of freedom at moderately large momentum transfers. The higher-twist\ncontributions have been examined through the evolution of these moments as the\nmomentum transfer varies from higher to lower values. Furthermore, QCD-inspired\nlow-energy effective theories, which explicitly include chiral symmetry\nbreaking, are tested at low momentum transfers. The validity of these theories\nis further examined as the momentum transfer increases to moderate values. It\nis found that chiral perturbation theory calculations agree reasonably well\nwith the first moment of the spin structure function g_1 at low momentum\ntransfer of 0.05 - 0.1 GeV^2 but fail to reproduce some of the higher moments,\nnoticeably, the neutron data in the case of the generalized polarizability\nDelta_LT.

A precise evaluation of Tc from zero-resistivity temperatures revealed\nthat Tc shows a slightly distorted dome-shaped curve, with maximum Tc (30 K) at\n6 GPa, which is lower than a previously reported Tc value (~37 K). With the\napplication of pressure, the temperature dependence of resistivity above Tc\nchanges dramatically to a linear dependence; a non-Fermi-liquid-like \"high-Tc\"\nphase appears above 3 GPa. We found a striking correlation between Tc and the\nSe height: the lower the Se height, the more enhanced is Tc.

We discover that viewed within our\nframework these theories are very similar, but differ in one key aspect - a\nfour element group we term the phase group which emerges naturally within our\nframework. In the case of the stabiliser theory this group is Z4 while for\nSpekkens's toy theory the group is Z2 x Z2. We further show that the structure\nof this group is intimately involved in a key physical difference between the\ntheories: whether or not they can be modelled by a local hidden variable\ntheory. This is done by establishing a connection between the phase group, and\nan abstract notion of GHZ state correlations. We go on to formulate precisely\nhow the stabiliser theory and toy theory are `similar' by defining a notion of\n`mutually unbiased qubit theory', noting that all such theories have four\nelement phase groups.

This includes pre-Lie structures for the geometry of flat and torsion\nfree connections appearing in the analysis of numerical flows on vector spaces.\nThe much more recent post-Lie and D-algebras appear in the analysis of flows on\nmanifolds with flat connections with constant torsion. Dynkin and Eulerian\nidempotents appear in the analysis of non-autonomous flows and in backward\nerror analysis. Non-commutative Bell polynomials and a non-commutative Fa\\`a di\nBruno Hopf algebra are other examples of structures appearing naturally in the\nnumerical analysis of integration on manifolds. \n\n"}

Consequently, one can\nextract physics from solar neutrino flux measurements while minimizing the\nconsequences of SSM uncertainties, by studying flux ratios with appropriate\npower-law weightings tuned to cancel this $T_c$ dependence. We re-examine an\nidea for constraining the primordial C+N content of the solar core from a ratio\nof CN-cycle $^{15}$O to pp-chain $^8$B neutrino fluxes, showing that nonnuclear\nSSM uncertainties in the ratio are small and effectively governed by a single\nparameter, the diffusion coefficient. We point out that measurements of both\nCN-I cycle neutrino branches -- $^{15}$O and $^{13}$N $\\beta$-decay -- could in\nprinciple lead to separate determinations of the core C and N abundances, due\nto out-of-equilibrium CN-cycle burning in the cooler outer layers of the solar\ncore. Finally, we show that the strategy of constructing \"minimum uncertainty\"\nneutrino flux ratios can also test other properties of the SSM. In particular,\nwe demonstrate that a weighted ratio of $^7$Be and $^8$B fluxes constrains a\nproduct of S-factors to the same precision currently possible with laboratory\ndata. \n\n"}

In such\ncases, $T$ is acting on a nice simplicial model category in such a way that $T$\ndescends to a monad on the homotopy category and defines a category of homotopy\n$T$-algebras. In this setting there is a forgetful functor from the homotopy\ncategory of $T$-algebras to the category of homotopy $T$-algebras.\n  Under suitable hypotheses we provide an obstruction theory, in the form of a\nBousfield-Kan spectral sequence, for lifting a homotopy $T$-algebra map to a\nstrict map of $T$-algebras. Once we have a map of $T$-algebras to serve as a\nbasepoint, the spectral sequence computes the homotopy groups of the space of\n$T$-algebra maps and the edge homomorphism on $\\pi_0$ is the aforementioned\nforgetful functor.

Second, in the case when $R$ is connected\ngraded, the unipotent automorphisms of $R$ are classified up to minor\nexceptions. This theorem is a far reaching extension of the classification\nresults [20, 22] previously used to settle the Andruskiewitsch--Dumas and\nLaunois--Lenagan conjectures.

A Hopf monoid (in the category of vector\nspecies) consists of a vector species with unit, counit, product, and coproduct\nmorphisms satisfying several compatibility conditions, analogous to a graded\nHopf algebra. A vector species has a basis if and only if it is given by a\nsequence of $S_n$-modules which are permutation representations. We say that a\nHopf monoid is freely self-dual if it is connected and finite-dimensional, and\nif it has a basis in which the structure constants of its product and coproduct\ncoincide. Such Hopf monoids are self-dual in the usual sense, and we show that\nthey are furthermore both commutative and cocommutative. We prove more specific\nclassification theorems for freely self-dual Hopf monoids whose products\n(respectively, coproducts) are linearized in the sense that they preserve the\nbasis; we call such Hopf monoids strongly self-dual (respectively, linearly\nself-dual). In particular, we show that every strongly self-dual Hopf monoid\nhas a basis isomorphic to some species of block-labeled set partitions, on\nwhich the product acts as the disjoint union.

The simple relation between quantum\n$R$-matrices and classical Lax operators is exploited in two ways.

A seed is a\ncombinatorial data which can be encoded as an $n\\times n$ matrix with integer\nentries, or as a quiver in special cases, together with $n$ formal variables. A\nmutation is a certain rule for transforming a seed into another seed; the new\nvariables are related to the previous variables by some rational expressions.\nTo each seed one attaches an $n$-dimensional torus, and by gluing the tori\nalong the birational maps defined by the mutation formulas, one constructs a\ncluster variety. Quantization of a cluster variety assigns to each seed a\nnon-commutative ring which deforms the classical ring of functions on the torus\nattached to the seed, as well as to each mutation an isomorphism of skew fields\nof fractions of these non-commutative rings. A representation realizes the\nnon-commutative rings as algebras of operators on Hilbert spaces, and the\nquantum mutation isomorphisms as unitary maps between the Hilbert spaces that\nintertwine the operators for the rings. These unitary intertwiners are one of\nthe major results of the Fock-Goncharov quantization of cluster varieties, and\nare given by the special function called the quantum dilogarithm. The classical\nmutations satisfy certain algebraic relations, which were known to be satisfied\nalso by the corresponding intertwiners up to complex constants of modulus $1$.\nThe present paper shows by computation that these constants are all $1$. One\nimplication is that the mapping class group representations resulting from the\napplication of the Fock-Goncharov quantization to the quantum Teichm\\\"uller\ntheory are genuine, not projective. \n\n"}

Consider semiinfinite cohomology of the trivial $\\frak\nu_\\ell$-module introduced in [Ar1], [Ar2]. It was shown in [Ar2] that the $Ext$\nalgebra of the trivial $\\frak u_\\ell$-module acts naturally on semiinfinite\ncohomology.
