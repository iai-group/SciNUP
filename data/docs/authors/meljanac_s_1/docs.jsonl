For the\ncorresponding current to be conserved the latter need not be manifestly\ninvariant: preservation modulo a gauge adjustment will suffice.

The quantization of the model leads to the noncommutativity\nwith mixed spacial and spin degrees of freedom.

We argue that in this system, $S_n$\nis a linear function of the length of the chains (boundary law) followed by a\nuniversal subleading constant $\\gamma_n$ determined by the ratio of the two TLL\nparameters.

Its quantisation is therefore straightforward in LQG like\nrepresentations which by design lead to non anomalous, unitary, albeit\ndiscontinuous representations of the spatial diffeomorphism group. In\nparticular, the complete set of (distributional) solutions to the quantum\nconstraints, a preferred and complete algebra of Dirac observables and the\nassociated physical inner product has been constructed.

A potential $V$ we assume\nto refer to the harmonic confinement or finite well of an arbitrary depth. We\nanalyze spectral solutions of the pertinent nonlocal quantum systems with a\nfocus on their $m$-dependence.

The aim of this letter is to extend this concept to the domain\nof field theories, by introducing field spaces (i.e. phase spaces of field\nvalues) that are not affine spaces. After discussing the motivation and general\naspects of our approach we present a detailed analysis of the prototype\n(quantum) Nonlinear Field Space Theory of a scalar field on the Minkowski\nbackground. We show that the nonlinear structure of a field space leads to\nnumerous interesting predictions, including: non-locality, generalization of\nthe uncertainty relations, algebra deformations, constraining of the maximal\noccupation number, shifting of the vacuum energy and renormalization of the\ncharge and speed of propagation of field excitations. Furthermore, a compact\nfield space is a natural way to implement the \"Principle of Finiteness\" of\nphysical theories, which once motivated the Born-Infeld theory. Thus the\npresented framework has a variety of potential applications in the theories of\nfundamental interactions (e.g. quantum gravity), as well as in condensed matter\nphysics (e.g. continuous spin chains), and can shed new light on the issue of\ndivergences in quantum field theories. \n\n"}

We argue that the OPE on the cover encodes both the\nstructure constants for the orbifold CFT and the explicit form of the mixing\noperators. We show this explicitly for some example operators.

The transverse spin operators, in $A^+ = 0$ gauge, expressed\nin terms of the dynamical variables are explicitly interaction dependent unlike\nthe helicity operator which is interaction independent in the topologically\ntrivial sector of light-front QCD. Although it cannot be separated into an\norbital and a spin part, we have shown that there exists an interesting\ndecomposition of the transverse spin operator. We discuss the physical\nrelevance of such a decomposition. We perform a one loop renormalization of the\nfull transverse spin operator in light-front Hamiltonian perturbation theory\nfor a dressed quark state. We explicitly show that all the terms dependent on\nthe center of mass momenta get canceled in the matrix element. The entire\nnon-vanishing contribution comes from the fermion intrinsic -like part of the\ntransverse spin operator as a result of cancellation between the gluonic\nintrinsic-like and the orbital-like part of the transverse spin operator.

These\nsolutions are locally invariant under 1/2 of D=6 supersymmetries, which,\nhowever, do not integrate to global Killing spinors. Other branes can be\nintroduced by hand by allowing for local deficit angles in the transverse space\nwithout generating any kind of curvature singularities. \n\n"}

Using the bounds on the relic vorton density, we show that D-strings with\nwinding number n>1 are more strongly constrained than cosmic strings arising in\ncosmological phase transitions.

The usual properties of\ndimensionful fields imply an infinite, projective tower of conformal weights\nassociated with the tangent space to scale-invariant spacetimes. Convergence\nand measurability on this tangent tower are guaranteed using a scale-invariant\nnorm, restricted to conformally self-dual vectors. Maps on the resulting\nHilbert space are correspondingly restricted to semi-definite conformal weight.\nWe find the maximally- and minimally-commuting, complete Lie algebras of\ndefinite-weight operators. The projective symmetry of the tower gives these\nalgebras central charges, giving the canonical commutator and quantum Virasoro\nalgebras, respectively. Using a continuous, m-parameter representation for\nrank-m tower tensors, we show that the parallel transport equation for the\nmomentum vector of a particle is the Schroedinger equation, while the\nassociated definite-weight operators obey canonical commutation relations.\nGeneralizing to the set of integral curves of general timelike, self-dual\nvector-valued weight maps gives a lifting such that the action of the curves\nparallel transports arbitrary tower vectors.

The comparison of the representation\ncategories of A and F is strongly intertwined with various issues related to\nbraided tensor categories. We explain that, given the representation category\nof A, the representation category of F can be computed (up to equivalence) by a\npurely categorical construction. The latter is of considerable independent\ninterest since it amounts to a Galois theory for braided tensor categories. We\nemphasize the characterization of modular categories as braided tensor\ncategories with trivial center and we state a double commutant theorem for\nsubcategories of modular categories. The latter implies that a modular category\nM which has a replete full modular subcategory M_1 is equivalent to M_1 x M_2\nwhere M_2=M\\cap M_1' is another modular subcategory.

These quantum algebras\nappears to be quite similar to the classical matrix algebra. In particular,\nquantum analogues of the characteristic polynomial and characteristic identity\nare obtained for them. The $q$-analogues of the Newton relations connecting two\ndifferent generating sets of central elements of these algebras (the\ndeterminant-like and the trace-like ones) are derived. This allows one to\nexpress the $q$-determinant of quantized vector fields in terms of their\n$q$-traces. \n\n"}

Localization on $\\Bbb{P}^1$ Abstract: This article is a sequel to hep-th/9411050, q-alg/9412017, q-alg/9503013.\nGiven a collection of $m$ finite factorizable sheaves $\\{\\CX_k\\}$, we construct\nhere some perverse sheaves over configuration spaces of points on a projective\nline $\\BP^1$ with $m$ additional marked points.

In such a way we\ngeneralize the lowest order of known nonstandard quantum deformation of sl(2)\nto the Lie algebras sp(4) = so(5) and sl(4) = so(6). As an exercise we\ninterpret nonstandard deformation of sl(2) as describing quantum D=1 conformal\nalgebra with fundamental mass parameter. Further we describe the D=3 and D=4\nconformal bialgebras with deformation parameters equal to the inverse of\nfundamental masses.

Irreducible\nrepresentations of $H_{n}(q)$, for generic $q$, are shown to be completely\ncharacterized by the corresponding eigenvalues of $C_{n}$ alone.
