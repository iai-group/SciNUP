{"id": "0704.1049", "contents": "Title: Charmless Three-body Decays of B Mesons Abstract: Charmless 3-body decays of B mesons are studied in the framework of the\nfactorization approach. The nonresonant contributions arising from $B\\to\nP_1P_2$ transitions are evaluated using heavy meson chiral perturbation theory\n(HMChPT). The momentum dependence of nonresonant amplitudes is assumed to be in\nthe exponential form $e^{-\\alpha_{NR}} p_B\\cdot(p_i+p_j)}$ so that the HMChPT\nresults are recovered in the soft meson limit $p_i, p_j\\to 0$. In addition, we\nhave identified another large source of the nonresonant signal in the matrix\nelements of scalar densities, e.g. $<K\\bar K|\\bar ss|0>$, which can be\nconstrained from the decay $\\bar B^0\\to K_SK_SK_S$ or $B^-\\to K^-K_SK_S$. The\nintermediate vector meson contributions to 3-body decays are identified through\nthe vector current, while the scalar meson resonances are mainly associated\nwith the scalar density. Their effects are described in terms of the\nBreit-Wigner formalism. Our main results are: (i) All KKK modes are dominated\nby the nonresonant background. The predicted branching ratios of\n$K^+K^-K_{S(L)}$, $K^+K^-K^-$ and $K^-K_SK_S$ modes are consistent with the\ndata within errors. (ii) Although the penguin-dominated $B^0\\to K^+K^-K_{S}$\ndecay is subject to a potentially significant tree pollution, its effective\n$\\sin 2\\beta$ is very similar to that of the $K_SK_SK_S$ mode. However, direct\nCP asymmetry of the former, being of order -4%, is more prominent than the\nlatter.

We concentrate on the LQs which only couple to the second-generation\nquarks before the electroweak symmetry breaking and we discuss in detail how\nflavor symmetry breaking effects are brought into the extension of the standard\nmodel after the spontaneous symmetry breaking. We find that the hermiticity of\nfermion mass matrices can not only reproduce the correct\nCabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa and Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata matrices, but also reduce\nthe number of independent flavor mixing matrices and lead to\n$V^{R}_{f}=V^{L}_{f}$ with $L(R)$ denoting the chirality of the f-type fermion.\nAccordingly, it is found that the decays $D_{s,d}\\to \\ell^{+} \\nu$, $B^{+}\\to\n\\tau^{+} \\nu$ and $B_c\\to \\ell^{+} \\nu$ have a strong correlation in\nparameters.

For instance, in SUSY models where the\ngravitino is lighter than the LOSP, the LOSP decays to its superpartner and a\nlongitudinal gravitino via supercurrent couplings. In this paper, we show that\nLOSP decays can be substantially modified when there are multiple sectors that\nbreak supersymmetry, where in addition to the gravitino there are light uneaten\ngoldstini. As a particularly striking example, a bino-like LOSP can have a near\n100% branching fraction to a higgs boson and an uneaten goldstino, even if the\nLOSP has negligible higgsino fraction.

We show that fitting short\nbaseline data sets to a (3+3) model, defined by three active and three sterile\nneutrinos, results in an overall goodness of fit of 67%, and a compatibility of\n90% among all data sets -- to be compared to the compatibility of 0.043% and\n13% for a (3+1) and a (3+2) model, respectively. While the (3+3) fit yields the\nhighest quality overall, it still finds inconsistencies with the MiniBooNE\nappearance data sets; in particular, the global fit fails to account for the\nobserved MiniBooNE low-energy excess.

For example, when one-hadron yields are measured in on-resonance\nB-factory data, a cut on the thrust event shape T is required to remove the\nlarge b-quark contribution. This leads to a dijet final state restriction for\nthe light-quark fragmentation process.

Liquid xenon is widely considered to\nbe one of the best target media for detection of WIMPs (Weakly Interacting\nMassive Particles which may form the galactic dark matter) using nuclear\nrecoils.

First,\nwe analyze the data used to claim the observation of neutrinoless double beta\ndecay in Ge-76, and find strong evidence (according to Jeffrey's scale) for a\npeak in the spectrum and moderate evidence for that the peak is actually close\nto the energy expected for the neutrinoless decay.

Because of the hierarchy-deltacp degeneracy and the\noctant-deltacp degeneracy, the impact of hierarchy on octant resolution has to\nbe taken into account. As in the case of hierarchy determination, there exist\nfavorable (unfavorable) values of deltacp for which octant resolution is easy\n(challenging). However, for octant resolution the unfavorable deltacp values of\nthe neutrino data are favorable for the anti-neutrino data and vice-verse.

Such operators motivate the existence of\nheavier states that couple to dark matter and are also charged under the\nelectroweak interactions. The recent hints of a gamma-ray line in the Fermi\ndata suggest that these states may be light enough to be produced at the LHC.\nWe categorize such states according to their charges and decay modes, and we\nexamine the corresponding LHC phenomenology. We emphasize unconstrained models\nthat can be discovered in targeted searches at the upgraded LHC run, while also\nenumerating models excluded by current data. Generally, models with\nSU(2)-singlet states or models where the charged states decay predominantly to\ntau leptons and/or gauge bosons are still viable. We propose searches to\nconstrain such models and, in particular, find superior performance over\nexisting proposals for multi-tau analyses. Finally, we note several scenarios,\nespecially those dominated by tau final states, that cannot be probed even with\n300/fb at LHC14, motivating the further refinement of tau lepton searches to\nimprove sensitivity to such final states. \n\n"}

{"id": "1304.7438", "contents": "Title: Flavor dependence of annihilation parameters in QCD factorization Abstract: For $B_{d,s} \\to \\pi^\\mp K^\\pm$ and $K^{(\\ast)} K^{(\\ast)}$ decays, the\nflavor symmetry breaking effects may be particularly small since the final\nstate interactions should be the same between the corresponding $B_d$ and $B_s$\ndecays due to the charge conjugation symmetry of the final states. This is\nconsistent with the newly measured direct CP asymmetry of $B_s \\to \\pi^+ K^-$.\nThese decays are thus supposed to be important in testing the Standard Model\nand in probing new physics effects. However, the observation of pure\nannihilation decay $B_s \\to \\pi^+ \\pi^-$ appears to imply a large annihilation\nscenario with $\\rho_A \\sim 3$, in contrast to the case of $\\rho_A \\sim 1$ in\n$B_{u,d}$ decays in the framework of QCD factorization. This seems to indicate\nunexpectedly large flavor symmetry breaking effects between the annihilation\namplitudes of $B_s$ and $B_{u,d}$ decays. This apparent contradiction could be\nresolved by noticing that there is a priori no reason to justify the common\npractice of assuming the universality of annihilation parameters for different\nDirac structures of effective operators. We then argue that, for $B_{d,s} \\to\n\\pi^\\mp K^\\pm$ decays, the flavor symmetry breaking effects of annihilation\namplitudes have all been included in the initial state decay constants and are\nthus small. But the flavor symmetry breaking effects in $B_{d,s} \\to K^{(\\ast)}\nK^{(\\ast)}$ decays are likely to be much larger, as part of the annihilation\ntopologies of $B_s \\to K K$ decay could be related to $B_s \\to \\pi^+ \\pi^-$\ndecay.

Abstract: An intriguing opposite sign of the CP violating asymmetry was recently\nmeasured in the tau decay modes tau -> Ks pi nutau by the BaBar collaboration,\nthan that expected within the Standard Model. If this result is confirmed with\nhigher precision, the observed decay rate asymmetry ACP, can only arise from\nsome Non-Standard Interactions(NSI) occurring possibly in both the hadronic as\nwell as in the leptonic sectors.

We show that the lowest-order dark matter-nucleus\nscattering rate can receive large and nucleus-dependent corrections at\nnext-to-leading order (NLO) in the chiral expansion. The size of these\ncorrections depends on the specific couplings of dark matter to quark flavors\nand gluons. In general the full NLO dark-matter-nucleus cross-section is not\nadequately described by just the zero-energy proton and neutron couplings.\nThese statements are concretely illustrated in a scenario where the dark matter\ncouples to quarks through scalar operators. We find the canonical IVDM scenario\ncan reconcile the null XENON and LUX results and the recent CDMS-Si findings\nprovided its couplings to second and third generation quarks either lie on a\nspecial line or are suppressed. Equally good fits with new values of the\nneutron-to-proton coupling ratio are found in the presence of nonzero heavy\nquark couplings.

Abstract: The Large Hadron Collider will directly probe distance scales as short as\n10^{-19}m, corresponding to energy scales at the level of a few TeV. In order\nto reach even higher resolutions before the advent of future high-energy\ncolliders, it is necessary to consider indirect probes of New Physics (NP), a\nprime example being Delta F=2 neutral meson mixing processes, which are\nsensitive to much shorter distance scales. However Delta F=2 processes alone\ncannot tell us much about the structure of NP beyond the LHC scales. To\nidentify for instance the presence of new quark flavour-changing dynamics of a\nleft-handed (LH) or right-handed (RH) nature, complementary results from Delta\nF=1 rare decay processes are vital. We therefore address the important question\nof whether NP could be seen up to energy scales as high as 200 TeV,\ncorresponding to distances as small as 10^{-21}m -- the Zeptouniverse -- in\nrare K and B_{s,d} decays, subject to present Delta F=2 constraints and\nperturbativity. We focus in particular on a heavy Z' gauge boson. If restricted\nto purely LH or RH Z' couplings to quarks, we find that rare K decays, in\nparticular KL-> pi^0 nu nubar and K^+->pi^+ nu nubar, allow us to probe the\nZeptouniverse. On the other hand rare B_s and B_d decays, which receive\nstronger Delta F=2 constraints, allow us to reach about 15 TeV. Allowing for\nboth LH and RH couplings a loosening of the Delta F=2 constraints is possible,\nand we find that the maximal values of M_Z' at which NP effects that are\nconsistent with perturbative couplings could be found are approximately 2000\nTeV for K decays and 160 TeV for rare B_{s,d} decays. Finally we present a\nsimple idea for an indirect determination of M_Z' that could be realised at the\nnext linear e^+e^- or mu^+ mu^- collider and with future precise flavour data. \n\n"}

All the earlier\nmodel predictions are too large compared with experiment. In this work, we\npoint out that for a given tree operator $O_i$, the contribution from its\nFiertz transformed operator, an effect often missed in the literature, tends to\ncancel the internal $W$-emission amplitude induced from $O_i$. The wave\nfunction of low-lying baryons are symmetric in momenta and the quark flavor\nwith the same chirality, but antisymmetric in color indices. Using these\nsymmetry properties and the chiral structure of weak interactions, we find that\nhalf of the Feynman diagrams responsible for internal $W$-emission cancel.\nSince this feature holds in the charmless modes but not in the charmful ones,\nwe advocate that the partial cancellation accounts for the smallness of the\ntree-dominated charmless two-body baryonic $B$ decays. This also explains why\nmost previous model calculations predicted too large rates as the above\nconsideration was not taken into account. Finally, we emphasize that, contrary\nto the claim in the literature, the internal $W$-emission tree amplitude should\nbe proportional to the Wilson coefficient $c_1+c_2$ rather than $c_1-c_2$. \n\n"}

Dominant nonresonant contributions to tree-dominated\nand penguin-dominated three-body decays arise from the $b\\to u$ tree transition\nand $b\\to s$ penguin transition, respectively.

This background becomes dominant in a kiloton-scale\nliquid-scintillator detector deep underground and is usually considered as\nirreducible due to an overlap in deposited energy with the signal.

Even though this\nphenomenon, known as superradiance, has been thoroughly analysed in several\ntheoretical scenarios (from eletromagnetic radiation scattering on a rotating\ncylinder to gravitational waves incident upon a rotating black hole), it has\nnever been observed. Here we describe in detail the first laboratory detection\nof superradiance.

The energy deposited in a ZDC fluctuates from one\nevent to another, but on average it is proportional to the number of absorbed\nnucleons. Forward nucleons are also emitted in electromagnetic dissociation\n(EMD) of nuclei in ultraperipheral collisions, and they are used to monitor the\nluminosity. As known, ZDC energy spectra are specific to each facility, because\nthey are affected by the ZDC acceptance, and the ZDC energy resolution depends\non the beam energy. In this work a simple combinatorial model leading to handy\nformulas has been proposed to connect the numbers of emitted and detected\nforward nucleons taking into account a limited ZDC acceptance. The ZDC energy\nspectra from the EMD with the emission of one, two, three and four forward\nneutrons and protons have been modeled for collision energies of NICA and the\nLHC.

They are the S3, U3 and U1 leptoquarks (LQs), and a triplet of\nSM-like vector bosons (VBs). Under the theoretical assumption that the NP\ncouples predominantly to the third generation, previous analyses found that,\nwhen constraints from other processes are taken into account, the S3, U3 and VB\nmodels cannot explain the B anomalies, but U1 is viable. In this paper, we\nreanalyze these models, but without any assumption about their couplings. We\nfind that, even in this most general case, S3 and U3 are excluded.

Also, the\nLFV constraints render unimportant those constraints obtained using the\nrenormalization group equations.

However, with this design\nthe majority of photons are lost in insensitive regions between photodetectors,\nwhile at the same time most photodetectors are outside the ring and remain\ndark. To fix both issues at once, we propose fixing retro-reflectors between\nall photodetectors. These devices will reflect uncollected photons back through\ntheir emission point onto photodetectors at the other side of the tank,\nproducing a secondary, delayed Cherenkov ring. Numerical simulations show that,\ndue to the parallax effect of this antipodal ring, our system can yield up to\n2x improvement of detector vertex and angle resolutions.

A Global Project Abstract: A large, world-wide community of physicists is working to realise an\nexceptional physics program of energy-frontier, electron-positron collisions\nwith the International Linear Collider (ILC). This program will begin with a\ncentral focus on high-precision and model-independent measurements of the Higgs\nboson couplings. This method of searching for new physics beyond the Standard\nModel is orthogonal to and complements the LHC physics program. The ILC at 250\nGeV will also search for direct new physics in exotic Higgs decays and in\npair-production of weakly interacting particles. Polarised electron and\npositron beams add unique opportunities to the physics reach. The ILC can be\nupgraded to higher energy, enabling precision studies of the top quark and\nmeasurement of the top Yukawa coupling and the Higgs self-coupling. The key\naccelerator technology, superconducting radio-frequency cavities, has matured.\nOptimised collider and detector designs, and associated physics analyses, were\npresented in the ILC Technical Design Report, signed by 2400 scientists. There\nis a strong interest in Japan to host this international effort. A detailed\nreview of the many aspects of the project is nearing a conclusion in Japan.

In particular\na scalar glueball is firmly expected at a mass of about 1730 MeV. This\nprediction has led to an intense study of scalar isoscalar interactions and to\nthe discovery of new meson resonances. The number of scalar states observed\nseems to exceed the number of states which can be accommodated in the quark\nmodel even when two states, the a_0(980) and f_0(980), are interpreted as K\nKbar bound states and are removed from the list. However, none of these states\nhas a decay pattern which is consistent with that of a pure glueball. A\nreasonable interpretation of the number of states and of their decay pattern is\nfound only when mixing of scalar q qbar states with the scalar glueball is\ntaken into account.\n  In this paper we scrutinize the evidence for these states and their\nproduction characteristics. The f_0(1370) - a cornerstone of all qbar\nq-glueball mixing scenarios - is shown to be likely of non-qbar q nature. The\nremaining scalar states then do fit into a nonet classification. If this\ninterpretation should be correct there would be no room for resonant scalar\ngluon-gluon interactions, no room for the scalar glueball.\n  We also discuss the status of mesons with exotic quantum numbers, of mesons\nwhich cannot possibly have qbar q structure, and argue that these are, most\nlikely, four-quark states and not excitations of the gluon string providing the\nbinding between quark and antiquark. \n\n"}

With version 4, TMVA has been extended to multivariate regression\nof a real-valued target vector. Regression is invoked through the same user\ninterfaces as classification. TMVA 4 also features more flexible data handling\nallowing one to arbitrarily form combined MVA methods. A generalised boosting\nmethod is the first realisation benefiting from the new framework. \n\n"}
