There is a\ndetailed mathematical understanding of the depinning transition in 2 dimensions\nwithout disorder. Then the variance of the interface height w.r.t. the Gibbs\nmeasure stays bounded uniformly in the volume for any positive pinning force\nand diverges like the logarithm of the pinning force when it tends to zero.\n  How does the presence of a quenched disorder term in the Hamiltonian modify\nthis transition? We show that an arbitarily weak random field term is enough to\nbeat an arbitrarily strong delta-pinning in 2 dimensions and will cause\ndelocalization. The proof is based on a rigorous lower bound for the overlap\nbetween local magnetizations and random fields in finite volume.

The width process of a splitting tree is then a binary, homogeneous\nCrump--Mode--Jagers (CMJ) process, and is not Markovian unless the lifetime\ndistribution is exponential. Here, we allow the birth rate to be infinite, that\nis, pairs of birth times and lifespans of newborns form a Poisson point process\nalong the lifetime of their mother, with possibly infinite intensity measure. A\nsplitting tree is a random (so-called) chronological tree. Each element of a\nchronological tree is a (so-called) existence point $(v,\\tau)$ of some\nindividual $v$ (vertex) in a discrete tree, where $\\tau$ is a nonnegative real\nnumber called chronological level (time).

Roughly speaking, there is one model for each {\\em kernel}, i.e., each\nsymmetric measurable function from $[0,1]^2$ to the non-negative reals,\nalthough the details are much more complicated. A different connection between\nkernels and random graphs arises in the recent work of Borgs, Chayes, Lov\\'asz,\nS\\'os, Szegedy and Vesztergombi. They introduced several natural metrics on\ndense graphs (graphs with $n$ vertices and $\\Theta(n^2)$ edges), showed that\nthese metrics are equivalent, and gave a description of the completion of the\nspace of all graphs with respect to any of these metrics in terms of {\\em\ngraphons}, which are essentially bounded kernels. One of the most appealing\naspects of this work is the message that sequences of inhomogeneous\nquasi-random graphs are in a sense completely general: any sequence of dense\ngraphs contains such a subsequence.\n  Our aim here is to briefly survey these results, and then to investigate to\nwhat extent they can be generalized to graphs with $o(n^2)$ edges.

The limiting\nfree energy in all these models along with Word GREM, a model proposed by us,\nturn out to be a cute consequence of large deviation principle (LDP). This LDP\nargument allows us to consider non-Gaussian driving distributions as well as\nexternal field. We could also consider random trees as the underlying tree\nstructure in GREM. In all these models, as expected, limiting free energy is\nnot 'universal' unlike the SK model. However it is 'rate specific'.\nConsideration of non-Gaussian driving distribution as well as different driving\ndistributions for the different levels of the underlying trees in GREM leads to\ninteresting phenomena. For example in REM, if the Hamiltonian is Binomial with\nparameter $N$ and $p$ then the existence of phase transition depends on the\nparameter $p$.

The set A is said to percolate if eventually all vertices\nare infected. Our aim is to understand this process on the grid, [n]^d, for\narbitrary functions n = n(t), d = d(t) and r = r(t), as t -> infinity. The main\nquestion is to determine the critical probability p_c([n]^d,r) at which\npercolation becomes likely, and to give bounds on the size of the critical\nwindow. In this paper we study this problem when r = 2, for all functions n and\nd satisfying d \\gg log n.\n  The bootstrap process has been extensively studied on [n]^d when d is a fixed\nconstant and 2 \\leq r \\leq d, and in these cases p_c([n]^d,r) has recently been\ndetermined up to a factor of 1 + o(1) as n -> infinity.

A\ncertainty-equivalence type distributed estimator of the consensus + innovations\nform is proposed in which, at each each observation sampling epoch agents\nupdate their local parameter estimates by appropriately combining the data\nreceived from their neighbors and the locally sensed new information\n(innovation). Under global observability of the networked sensing model, i.e.,\nthe ability to distinguish between different instances of the parameter value\nbased on the joint observation statistics, and mean connectivity of the\ninter-agent communication network, the proposed estimator is shown to yield\nconsistent parameter estimates at each network agent. Further, it is shown that\nthe distributed estimator is asymptotically efficient, in that, the asymptotic\ncovariances of the agent estimates coincide with that of the optimal\ncentralized estimator, i.e., the inverse of the centralized Fisher information\nrate.

We will mainly describe the algebraic structure, its natural morphisms\nand parameterizations. The theory of total positivity will play a particularly\nimportant role.\n  Then, we anticipate on the probabilistic part by exhibiting a canonical\nmeasure on geometric crystals. It uses as ingredients the superpotential for\nthe flag manifold and a measure invariant under the crystal actions. The image\nmeasure under the weight map plays the role of Duistermaat-Heckman measure. Its\nLaplace transform defines Whittaker functions, providing an interesting formula\nfor all Lie groups. Then it appears clearly that Whittaker functions are to\ngeometric crystals, what characters are to combinatorial crystals.

It is based on the fundamental idea that the Wiener measure\nwill induce the adequate measure on the algebraic structures through the path\nmodel.\n  In the last chapter, we show how our geometric model degenerates to the\ncontinuous classical Littelmann path model and thus recover known results.

Thus, the only way to save energy is to turn off servers\nwhich are not processing a job. However, when there are some waiting jobs, we\nhave to turn on the OFF servers. A server needs some setup time to be active\nduring which it consumes energy but cannot process a job. Therefore, there\nexists a trade-off between power consumption and delay performance.

However, in practice the precise relationship\nbetween the signal x and the observations y_i may not follow the linear model,\nand in some cases it may not even be known. To address this challenge, in this\npaper we propose a general model where it is only assumed that each observation\ny_i may depend on a_i only through <a_i, x>. We do not assume that the\ndependence is known. This is a form of the semiparametric single index model,\nand it includes the linear model as well as many forms of the generalized\nlinear model as special cases. We further assume that the signal x has some\nstructure, and we formulate this as a general assumption that x belongs to some\nknown (but arbitrary) feasible set K.

The theory is based on the mean\nwidth of K, a geometric parameter which can be used to understand its effective\ndimension in estimation problems.

We consider fluctuations of the height\nfunction of this model on a large grid of size $T$ and show that they too are\nof order $T^{1 / 3}$ along a certain characteristic line; this confirms a\nprediction of Bukman and Shore from 1995 stating that the ferroelectric\nsix-vertex model should exhibit KPZ growth at the conical singularity.\n  Upon scaling the height fluctuations by $T^{1 / 3}$, we again recover the\nBaik-Rains distribution in the large $T$ limit. Recasting this statement in\nterms of the (asymmetric) stochastic six-vertex model confirms a prediction of\nGwa and Spohn from 1992. \n\n"}

While saturated-buffer\nscenarios have been widely investigated and yield useful throughput estimates\nfor persistent sessions, they fail to capture the fluctuations in buffer\ncontents over time, and provide no insight in the delay performance of flows\nwith intermittent packet arrivals. Motivated by that issue, we explore in the\npresent paper random-access networks with buffer dynamics, where flows with\nempty buffers refrain from competition for the medium. The occurrence of empty\nbuffers thus results in a complex dynamic interaction between activity states\nand buffer contents, which severely complicates the performance analysis. Hence\nwe focus on a many-sources regime where the total number of nodes grows large,\nwhich not only offers mathematical tractability but is also highly relevant\nwith the densification of wireless networks as the Internet of Things emerges.\nWe exploit time scale separation properties to prove that the properly scaled\nbuffer occupancy process converges to the solution of a deterministic\ninitial-value problem, and establish the existence and uniqueness of the\nassociated fixed point. This approach simplifies the performance analysis of\nnetworks with huge numbers of nodes to a low-dimensional fixed-point\ncalculation.

It may be summarised by an exponent\ntriple $(1/2,1/3,2/3)$ representing local interface fluctuation, local\nroughness (or inward deviation) and convex hull facet length. The three effects\narise, for example, in droplets in planar Ising models (Alexander, '01,\nHammond, '11,'12). In this article, we offer a new perspective on this\nphenomenon. We consider directed last passage percolation model in the plane, a\nparadigmatic example in the KPZ universality class, and constrain the\nmaximizing path under the additional requirement of enclosing an atypically\nlarge area. The interface suffers a constraint of parabolic curvature as\nbefore, but now its local structure is the KPZ fixed point polymer's rather\nthan Brownian.

This includes Gessel's\nfamous model, and the first proof ever found for one model with weighted steps.\nTo be applicable, the method requires the existence of two rational functions\ncalled invariant and decoupling function respectively. When they exist,\nalgebraicity follows almost automatically.\n  Then, we move to a complex analytic viewpoint that has already proved very\npowerful, leading in particular to integral expressions for the generating\nfunction in the non-D-finite cases, as well as to proofs of non-D-finiteness.\nWe develop in this context a weaker notion of invariant. Now all quadrant\nmodels have invariants, and for those that have in addition a decoupling\nfunction, we obtain integral-free expressions for the generating function, and\na proof that this series is D-algebraic (that is, satisfies polynomial\ndifferential equations). \n\n"}

In particular, we obtain non-trivial upper and\nlower bounds for the cardinality of a graph distance ball consistent with the\nWatabiki (1993) prediction for the Hausdorff dimension of $\\gamma$-LQG and we\nestablish the existence of an exponent for certain distances in the map.\n  The basic idea of our approach is to compare a given random planar map $M$ to\na mated-CRT map---a random planar map constructed from a correlated\ntwo-dimensional Brownian motion---using a strong coupling (Zaitsev, 1998) of\nthe encoding walk for $M$ and the Brownian motion used to construct the\nmated-CRT map. This allows us to deduce estimates for graph distances in $M$\nfrom the estimates for graph distances in the mated-CRT map which we proved\n(using continuum theory) in a previous work. In the special case when\n$\\gamma=\\sqrt{8/3}$, we instead deduce estimates for the $\\sqrt{8/3}$-mated-CRT\nmap from known results for the UIPT.\n  The arguments of this paper do not directly use SLE/LQG, and can be read\nwithout any knowledge of these objects. \n\n"}

For each of these maps, we\nobtain an upper bound for the Green's function on the diagonal, an upper bound\nfor the effective resistance to the boundary of a metric ball, an upper bound\nfor the return probability of the random walk to its starting point after $n$\nsteps, and a lower bound for the graph-distance displacement of the random\nwalk, all of which are sharp up to polylogarithmic factors.\n  When combined with work of Lee (2017), our bound for the return probability\nshows that the spectral dimension of each of these random planar maps is a.s.\nequal to 2, i.e., the (quenched) probability that the simple random walk\nreturns to its starting point after $2n$ steps is $n^{-1+o_n(1)}$.

LD is\nbased on the first-order Langevin diffusion which is reversible in time. We\nstudy two variants that are based on non-reversible Langevin diffusions: the\nunderdamped Langevin dynamics (ULD) and the Langevin dynamics with a\nnon-symmetric drift (NLD). Adopting the techniques of Tzen, Liang and Raginsky\n(2018) for LD to non-reversible diffusions, we show that for a given local\nminimum that is within an arbitrary distance from the initialization, with high\nprobability, either the ULD trajectory ends up somewhere outside a small\nneighborhood of this local minimum within a recurrence time which depends on\nthe smallest eigenvalue of the Hessian at the local minimum or they enter this\nneighborhood by the recurrence time and stay there for a potentially\nexponentially long escape time. The ULD algorithms improve upon the recurrence\ntime obtained for LD in Tzen, Liang and Raginsky (2018) with respect to the\ndependency on the smallest eigenvalue of the Hessian at the local minimum.\nSimilar result and improvement are obtained for the NLD algorithm.

Our aim is to explain\nwhat the harmonic analysis on U(infinity) consists of.\n  We deal with unitary representations of a reasonable class, which are in 1-1\ncorrespondence with characters (central, positive definite, normalized\nfunctions on U(infinity)). The decomposition of any representation of this\nclass is described by a probability measure (called spectral measure) on the\nspace of indecomposable characters.

For certain parameters\n(high density, large time horizon) and dimensions $ d\\ge 3 $ the empirical path\nmeasure is not supported on all paths $ [0,\\infty)\\to\\mathbb{R}^d $ which\ncontain a bridge path of any finite multiple of the time horizon $ [0,\\beta] $.\nFor dimensions $ d=1,2 $, and for small densities and small time horizon $\n[0,\\beta] $ in dimensions $ d\\ge 3$, the empirical path measure is supported on\nthose paths. In the first regime a finite fraction of the motions lives in\ncycles of infinite length.\n  We outline that this transition leads to an empirical path measure\ninterpretation of {\\it Bose-Einstein condensation}, known for systems of\nBosons. \n\n"}

In the second argument, we show that the distribution\nof \\lambda is asymptotically given by the usual local limit theorem, but the\nresulting Gaussian is disguised by an extra polynomial weight and by reflecting\nwalls. Both arguments more generally apply to an arbitrary finite-dimensional\nrepresentation V of an arbitrary simple Lie algebra g.

{"id": "quant-ph/0305126", "contents": "Title: General Probabilistic Framework of Randomness Abstract: We introduce a new mathematical framework for the probabilistic description\nof an experiment upon a system of any type in terms of initial information\nrepresenting this system. Based on the notions of an information state, an\ninformation state space and a generalized observable, this general framework\ncovers the description of a wide range of experimental situations including\nthose where, with respect to a system, an experiment is perturbing. We prove\nthat, to any experiment upon a system, there corresponds a unique generalized\nobservable on a system initial information state space, which defines the\nprobability distribution of outcomes under this experiment. We specify the case\nwhere initial information on a system provides \"no knowledge\" for the\ndescription of an experiment. Incorporating in a uniform way the basic notions\nof conventional probability theory and the non-commutativity aspects and the\nbasic notions of quantum measurement theory, our framework clarifies the\nprinciple difference between Kolmogorov's model in probability theory and the\nstatistical model of quantum theory. Both models are included into our\nframework as particular cases. We show that the phenomenon of \"reduction\" of a\nsystem initial information state is inherent, in general, to any\nnon-destructive experiment and upon a system of any type. Based on our general\nframework, we introduce the probabilistic model for the description of\nnon-destructive experiments upon a quantum system and prove that positive\nbounded linear mappings on the Banach space of trace class operators, arising\nin the description of experiments upon a quantum system, are completely\npositive. \n\n"}
