Therefore, investigation of this decay rate plays a crucial\nrole in the related theory and applications - for example, in construction of\nquadratures, interpolation, filter design, etc.\n  The significance of PSWFs and, in particular, of the decay rate of the\neigenvalues of the associated integral operator, was realized at least half a\ncentury ago.

The notion of $S$-spectrum is relatively new,\nsee [17], and has been used for quaternionic linear operators, as well as for\n$n$-tuples of not necessarily commuting operators, to define and study a\nnoncommutative versions of the Riesz-Dunford functional calculus. The main\ntools to prove the spectral theorem for unitary operators are the quaternionic\nversion of Herglotz's theorem, which relies on the new notion of $q$-positive\nmeasure, and quaternionic spectral measures, which are related to the\nquaternionic Riesz projectors defined by means of the $S$-resolvent operator\nand the $S$-spectrum. The results in this paper restore the analogy with the\ncomplex case in which the classical notion of spectrum appears in the\nRiesz-Dunford functional calculus as well as in the spectral theorem. \n\n"}

To avoid this situation, we introduce in this paper a broader\ndefinition of superunitary representation, relying on a new definition of\nHilbert superspace. The latter is inspired by the notion of Krein space and was\ndeveloped initially for noncommutative supergeometry. For Heisenberg\nsupergroups, this new approach yields a smooth generalization, whatever the\nsignature, of the unitary representation theory of the classical Heisenberg\ngroup. First, we obtain Schrodinger-like representations by quantizing generic\ncoadjoint orbits. They satisfy the new definition of irreducible superunitary\nrepresentations and serve as ground to the main result of this paper: a\ngeneralized Stone-von Neumann theorem.

The\nreader interested in applications should be able read right away the results\nrelated to those examples, beginning with Section 5. Our general, theoretical\nresults are that an operator adapted to the geometry is Fredholm if, and only\nif, it is elliptic and all its limit operators, in a sense to be made precise,\nare invertible. Central to our theoretical results is the concept of a Fredholm\ngroupoid, which is the class of groupoids for which this characterization of\nthe Fredholm condition is valid. We use the notions of exhaustive and strictly\nspectral families of representations to obtain a general characterization of\nFredholm groupoids.

This research\nwas initiated in the seminal work of Johnson, Maurey, Schechtman and Tzafriri\n(JMST, 1979). Somewhat later it was extended by Kalton to lattice structures\n(1993). In particular, in JMST (see also Lindenstrauss-Tzafriri book [1979,\nSection 2.f]) it was shown that the space $L_2 \\cap L_p$ for $2 \\leq p <\n\\infty$ (resp. $L_2+L_p$ for $1 < p \\leq 2$) is isomorphic to $L_p$.

It may be summarised by an exponent\ntriple $(1/2,1/3,2/3)$ representing local interface fluctuation, local\nroughness (or inward deviation) and convex hull facet length. The three effects\narise, for example, in droplets in planar Ising models (Alexander, '01,\nHammond, '11,'12). In this article, we offer a new perspective on this\nphenomenon. We consider directed last passage percolation model in the plane, a\nparadigmatic example in the KPZ universality class, and constrain the\nmaximizing path under the additional requirement of enclosing an atypically\nlarge area. The interface suffers a constraint of parabolic curvature as\nbefore, but now its local structure is the KPZ fixed point polymer's rather\nthan Brownian. The local interface fluctuation exponent is thus two-thirds\nrather than one-half. We prove that the facet lengths of the constrained path's\nconvex hull are governed by an exponent of $3/4$, and inward deviation by an\nexponent of $1/2$. That is, the exponent triple is now $(2/3,1/2,3/4)$ in place\nof $(1/2,1/3,2/3)$. This phenomenon appears to be shared among various\nisoperimetrically extremal circuits in local randomness.

Our\nresults show that, depending on the geometry of this boundary, two types of\nartifacts can arise: object-dependent and object-independent artifacts.\nObject-dependent artifacts are generated by singularities of the object being\nscanned and these artifacts can extend along lines. They generalize the streak\nartifacts observed in limited-angle tomography. Object-independent artifacts,\non the other hand, are essentially independent of the object and take one of\ntwo forms: streaks on lines if the boundary of the data set is not smooth at a\npoint and curved artifacts if the boundary is smooth locally.

Quantum versions of functional\ninequalities (like the modified logarithmic Sobolev and Poincar\\'{e}\ninequalities) and the so-called transportation cost inequalities, have proved\nto be essential for this purpose. Classical functional and transportation cost\ninequalities are seen to arise from a single geometric inequality, called the\nRicci lower bound, via an inequality which interpolates between them. The\nlatter is called the HWI-inequality, where the letters I, W and H are,\nrespectively, acronyms for the Fisher information (arising in the modified\nlogarithmic Sobolev inequality), the so-called Wasserstein distance (arising in\nthe transportation cost inequality) and the relative entropy (or Boltzmann H\nfunction) arising in both.

These theorems open\nup a new direction for study of iterated Ito and Stratonovich stochastic\nintegrals. We consider two theorems on expansion of iterated Ito stochastic\nintegrals of arbitrary multiplicity $k$ $(k\\in\\mathbb{N})$ based on generalized\nmultiple Fourier series converging in the sense of norm in Hilbert space\n$L_2([t, T]^k)$. We adapt these theorems on expansion of iterated Ito\nstochastic integrals of arbitrary multiplicity $k$ $(k\\in\\mathbb{N})$ for\niterated Stratonovich stochastic integrals of multiplicities 1 to 8 (the case\nof continuously differentiable weight functions and a complete orthonormal\nsystem of Legendre polynomials or trigonometric functions in $L_2([t, T])$) and\nfor iterated Stratonovich stochastic integrals of multiplicities 1 to 6 (the\ncase of an arbitrary complete orthonormal system of functions in $L_2([t,\nT])$).

Motivated by this, we consider a charging station with finitely\nmany parking spaces, in which electric vehicles arrive in order to get charged.\nAn EV has a random parking time and a random charging time. Both the charging\nrate per vehicle and the charging rate possible for the station are assumed to\nbe limited. Thus, the charging rate of uncharged EVs depends on the number of\ncars charging simultaneously. This model leads to a layered queueing network in\nwhich parking spaces with EV chargers have a dual role, of a server (to cars)\nand customers (to the grid). We are interested in the performance of the\naforementioned model, focusing on the fraction of vehicles that get fully\ncharged. To do so, we develop several bounds and asymptotic (fluid and\ndiffusion) approximations for the vector process, which describes the total\nnumber of EVs and the number of not fully charged EVs in the charging station,\nand we compare these bounds and approximations with numerical outcomes. \n\n"}

This paper establishes the converse: Each continuous tensor\nproduct systems of Hilbert spaces comes with measure types of distributions of\nrandom (closed) sets in [0,1] or $R_+$. These measure types are stationary and\nfactorise over disjoint intervals. In a special case of this construction, the\ncorresponding measure type is an invariant of the product system and the range\nof the invariant is characterized.\n  Moreover, based on a detailed study of this kind of measure types, we\nconstruct for each stationary factorizing measure type a continuous tensor\nproduct systems of Hilbert spaces such that this measure type arises as the\nbefore mentioned invariant.\n  The measure types of the above described kind are connected with\nrepresentations of the corresponding $L^\\infty$-spaces.

The notion of G-normal distribution plays the same important rule in\nthe theory of sublinear expectation as that of normal distribution in the\nclassic probability theory. It is then natural and interesting to ask if we\nhave the corresponding LLN and CLT under a sublinear expectation and, in\nparticular, if the corresponding limit distribution of the CLT is a G-normal\ndistribution. This paper gives an affirmative answer. The proof of our CLT is\nshort since we borrow a deep interior estimate of fully nonlinear PDE in [6]\nwhich extended a profound result of [1] (see also [7]) to parabolic PDEs. The\nassumptions of our LLN and CLT can be still improved. But the discovered\nphenomenon plays the same important rule in the theory of nonlinear expectation\nas that of the classical LLN and CLT in classic probability theory. \n\n"}
