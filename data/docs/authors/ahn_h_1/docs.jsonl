The new radio data\nconfirm the triple radio structure with a central core and two resolved radio\nlobes. This implies that the previously detected fast outflow of neutral gas is\noccurring off-nucleus, near a radio lobe about 0.5 kpc from the core. The\nionised gas shows complex kinematics in the region co-spatial with the radio\nemission. Broad and blueshifted (~ 500 km/s) emission is observed in the region\nof the radio lobe, at the same location as the blueshifted HI absorption. The\nvelocity of the ionised outflow is similar to the one found in HI. The first\norder correspondence between the radio and optical properties suggests that the\noutflow is driven by the interaction between the radio jet and the ISM. Despite\nthe high outflow velocities, no evidence is found for the ionisation of the gas\nbeing due to fast shocks in the region of the outflow, indicating that\nphotoionisation from the AGN is likely to be the dominant ionisation mechanism.\nThe outflow rate of the warm (ionised) gas is small compared to that of the\ncold gas. The mass outflow rate associated with the HI is in the same range as\nfor ``mild'' starburst-driven superwinds in ULIRGs. However, in IC5063, the\nAGN-driven outflow appears to be limited to the inner kpc region of the galaxy.\nThe kinetic power associated with the HI outflow is a small fraction (a few x\n10^-4) of the Eddington luminosity of the galaxy but is a significant fraction\n(~ 0.1) of the nuclear bolometric luminosity. In IC5063, the outflows may have\nsufficient kinetic power to have a significant impact on the evolution of the\nISM in the host galaxy. \n\n"}

Also dM stars have extremely long life times (longer than 50-100 Gyr).\nDetermining the number of red dwarfs with planets and assessing planetary\nhabitability (a planet's potential to develop and sustain life) is critically\nimportant because such studies would indicate how common life is in the\nuniverse. Our program - \"Living with a Red Dwarf\" - addresses these questions\nby investigating the long-term nuclear evolution and the coronal and\nchromospheric properties of red dwarf stars with widely different ages (~50 Myr\n-- 12 Gyr). One major focus of the program is to study the magnetic-dynamo\ngenerated coronal and chromospheric X-ray--FUV/UV emissions and flare\nproperties of a sample of dM0--5 stars. Observations carried out by FUSE of a\nnumber of young to old dM stars provide important data for understanding\ntransition region heating in these stars with deep convective zones as well as\nproviding measures of FUV irradiances.

For the mass reduction case and recoil directed along the disk's\nangular momentum, oscillations are induced in the disk which then modulate the\ninternal energy and bremsstrahlung luminosities. On the other hand, when the\nrecoil direction has a component orthogonal to the disk's angular momentum, the\ndisk's dynamics are strongly impacted, giving rise to relativistic shocks. The\nshock heating leaves its signature in our proxies for radiation, the total\ninternal energy and bremsstrahlung luminosity.

Its main features are a hard X-ray flash (~20 keV)\nlasting ~0.01 s with a total radiated energy of ~10^{40} ergs, followed by a\ncooling tail. This creates a distinct feature in the visual light curve, which\nis separate from the nickel decay. This cooling tail has a maximum absolute\nvisual magnitude of M_V = -9 to -10 at approximately 1 day, which depends most\nsensitively on the white dwarf radius at the time of the DDT.

Such a large instantaneous inflow\ncannot have persisted over a Hubble time. The central constant-entropy\ntemperature peak recently observed in the innermost 150 parsecs is explained by\ncompressive heating as gas flows toward the central massive black hole. Since\nthe cooling time of this gas is only a few million years, NGC 4649 provides the\nmost acutely concentrated known example of the cooling flow problem in which\nthe time-integrated apparent mass that has flowed into the galactic core\nexceeds the total mass observed there.

The GeV emission has three main properties: (i) its duration is\noften longer than the duration of the softer emission detected by the Gamma\nBurst Monitor (GBM) onboard Fermi [this confirms earlier results from the\nEnergetic Gamma-Ray Experiment Telescope (EGRET)]; (ii) its spectrum is\nconsistent with F(v) propto v^(-1) and does not show strong spectral evolution;\n(iii) for the brightest bursts, the flux detected by the LAT decays as a power\nlaw with a typical slope: t^(-1.5). We argue that the observed >0.1 GeV flux\ncan be interpreted as afterglow emission shortly following the start of the\nprompt phase emission as seen at smaller frequencies.

Extending methods from transient stability,\nsynchronization theory, and consensus protocols, we establish sufficient\nconditions for synchronization of non-uniform Kuramoto oscillators. These\nconditions reduce to and improve upon previously-available tests for the\nstandard Kuramoto model. Combining our singular perturbation and Kuramoto\nanalyses, we derive concise and purely algebraic conditions that relate\nsynchronization and transient stability of a power network to the underlying\nsystem parameters and initial conditions. \n\n"}

The\npresence of extragalactic magnetic fields could also induce conversions between\nvery high-energy photons and hypothetical axion-like particles (ALPs). The\nturbulent structure of the extragalactic magnetic fields would produce a\nstochastic behaviour in these conversions, leading to a statistical\ndistribution of the photon transfer functions for the different realizations of\nthe random magnetic fields.

The last two distributions are connected with two types of\nfractal geometry of the matter distribution. Scaling voids with Pareto\ndistribution appear in fractal distributions with box-counting dimension\nsmaller than three (its maximum value), whereas the lognormal void distribution\ncorresponds to multifractals with box-counting dimension equal to three.\nMoreover, voids of the former type persist in the continuum limit, namely, as\nthe number density of observable objects grows, giving rise to lacunar\nfractals, whereas voids of the latter type disappear in the continuum limit,\ngiving rise to non-lacunar (multi)fractals.

The source was observed in V, R and i-bands\nusing the Faulkes Telescopes North and South. The light curve is dominated by\nlong-term variations which are correlated (at the > 3 sigma level) with the\nRXTE ASM soft X-ray flux. The variations span one magnitude in all three\nfilters. We find no evidence for periodicities in our light curves, contrary to\na previous short-timescale optical study in which the flux varied on a 9.3-hour\nsinusoidal period by a smaller amplitude. The optical spectral energy\ndistribution is blue and typical of LMXBs in outburst, as is the power law\nindex of the correlation beta = 0.5, where F_{nu,OPT} propto F_X^beta. The\ndiscrete cross-correlation function reveals a peak at an X-ray lag of 2 - 14\ndays, which could be the viscous timescale. However, adopting the least squares\nmethod the strongest correlation is at a lag of 0 +/- 4 days, consistent with\nX-ray reprocessing on the surface of the disc. We therefore constrain the\noptical lag behind X-ray to be between -14 and +4 days. In addition, we use the\noptical - X-ray luminosity diagram for LMXBs as a diagnostic tool to constrain\nthe nature of the compact object in 4U 1957+11, since black hole (BH) and\nneutron star (NS) sources reside in different regions of this diagram.

SN 2008iy showed an unprecedentedly long rise time of\n~400 days, making it the first SN to take significantly longer than 100 days to\nreach peak optical luminosity. The peak absolute magnitude of SN 2008iy was M_r\n~ -19.1 mag, and the total radiated energy over the first ~700 days was ~2 x\n10^50 erg. Spectroscopically, SN 2008iy is very similar to the Type IIn SN\n1988Z at late times, and, like SN 1988Z, it is a luminous X-ray source (both\nsupernovae had an X-ray luminosity L_ X > 10^41 erg/s). The Halpha emission\nprofile of SN 2008iy shows a narrow P Cygni absorption component, implying a\npre-SN wind speed of ~100 km/s. We argue that the luminosity of SN 2008iy is\npowered via the interaction of the SN ejecta with a dense, clumpy circumstellar\nmedium. The ~400 day rise time can be understood if the number density of\nclumps increases with distance over a radius ~1.7 x 10^16 cm from the\nprogenitor. This scenario is possible if the progenitor experienced an episodic\nphase of enhanced mass-loss < 1 century prior to explosion or the progenitor\nwind speed increased during the decades before core collapse. We favour the\nformer scenario, which is reminiscent of the eruptive mass-loss episodes\nobserved for luminous blue variable (LBV) stars. The progenitor wind speed and\nincreased mass-loss rates serve as further evidence that at least some, and\nperhaps all, Type IIn supernovae experience LBV-like eruptions shortly before\ncore collapse.

If the WIMP\ndistribution is predominantly smooth, the Galactic recoil distribution is\npeaked in the direction opposite to the direction of Solar motion. Previous\nstudies have found that, for an ideal detector, of order 10 WIMP events would\nbe sufficient to reject isotropy, and rule out an isotropic background.

Quintessence fields in the dark energy regime and inflaton fields\nduring inflation often have a very large background field value. Thus any other\nfield with its mass dependent on the quintessence/inflaton background field\nvalue through a moderate coupling will become very massive during the dark\nenergy/inflation phase and its quantum corrections to the scalar effective\npotential will be suppressed. This concept is developed in this paper using the\ndecoupling theorem.

Most of the precise NS mass measurements that have been made to\ndate show values close to 1.4 solar masses, but a reliable measurement of an\nover-massive NS would constrain the EOS possibilities.

Consistent with the\npowerful, high-z giant radio galaxies we have studied previously, X-rays seem\nto be invariably found where the lobe plasma is oldest even where the radio\nemission has long since faded. The hotspot complexes seem to show structures\nresembling the double shock structure exhibited by the largest radio quasar\n4C74.26, with the X-ray shock again being offset closer to the nucleus than the\nradio synchrotron shock. In the current paper, the offsets between these shocks\nare even larger at 35kpc.

The diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) mechanism is usually\ninvoked to explain this acceleration, but the way in which electrons are\ninitially energized or 'injected' into this acceleration process starting from\nthermal energies is an unresolved problem. In this paper we study the initial\nacceleration of electrons in non-relativistic shocks from first principles,\nusing two- and three-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) plasma simulations. We\nsystematically explore the space of shock parameters (the Alfv\\'enic Mach\nnumber, M_A, the shock velocity, v_{sh}, the angle between the upstream\nmagnetic field and the shock normal, theta_{Bn}, and the ion to electron mass\nratio, m_i/m_e). We find that significant non-thermal acceleration occurs due\nto the growth of oblique whistler waves in the foot of quasi-perpendicular\nshocks. The obtained electron energy distributions show power law tails with\nspectral indices up to alpha ~ 3-4. The maximum energies of the accelerated\nparticles are consistent with the electron Larmor radii being comparable to\nthat of the ions, indicating potential injection into the subsequent DSA\nprocess. This injection mechanism, however, requires the shock waves to have\nfairly low Alf\\'enic Mach numbers, M_A <~ 20, which is consistent with the\ntheoretical conditions for the growth of whistler waves in the shock foot (M_A\n<~ (m_i/m_e)^{1/2}). Thus, if the whistler mechanism is the only robust\nelectron injection process at work in SNR shocks, then SNRs that display\nnon-thermal emission must have significantly amplified upstream magnetic\nfields. Such field amplification is likely achieved by the escaping cosmic\nrays, so electron and proton acceleration in SNR shocks must be interconnected. \n\n"}

The magnetic-energy fraction can reach $epsilon_B \\sim$ 0.1\nbut depends on the initial magnetic field strength. We find that the magnetic\nenergy grows by at least two orders of magnitude compared to the magnetic\nenergy immediately behind the shock. This minimum degree of the amplification\ndoes not depend on the amplitude of the initial density fluctuations, while the\ngrowth timescale and the maximum magnetic energy depend on the degree of\ninhomogeneity in the density.

Results: The\ntimescale for PAH destruction by cosmic ray ions depends on the electronic\nexcitation energy Eo and on the amount of energy available for dissociation.\nSmall PAHs are destroyed faster, with He and the CNO group being the more\neffective projectiles.

We performed monitoring of 42 blazars in the optical and\nnear-infrared bands from 2008 to 2010 using TRISPEC attached to the \"Kanata\"\n1.5-m telescope. We found that 28 blazars exhibited \"bluer-when-brighter\"\ntrends in their whole or a part of time-series data sets. This corresponds to\n88% of objects that were observed for >10 days. Thus, our observation\nunambiguously confirmed that the \"bluer-when-brighter\" trend is common in the\nemission from blazar jets. This trend was apparently generated by a variation\ncomponent with a constant and relatively blue color and an underlying red\ncomponent. Prominent short-term flares on time scales of days--weeks tended to\nexhibit a spectral hysteresis; their rising phases were bluer than their decay\nphases around the flare maxima. In contrast to the strong flux--color\ncorrelation, the correlation of the flux and polarization degree was relatively\nweak; only 10 objects showed significant positive correlations. Rotations of\npolarization were detected only in three objects: PKS 1510-089, 3C 454.3, and\nPKS 1749+096, and possibly in S5 0716+714.

Twisted electrons in the intermediate energy range have also been\ndemostrated experimentally; twisted protons and other particles can in\nprinciple be created in a similar way. Collisions of energetic twisted states\ncan offer a new look at particle properties and interactions. A theoretical\ndescription of twisted particle scattering developed previously treated them as\npure Bessel states and ran into difficulty when describing the OAM of the final\ntwisted particle at non-zero scattering angles.

Nine of our\nsample clusters are located in the halo of M31 and the most remote one is out\nto a projected radius of 78.75 kpc from the galactic center. For all our sample\nclusters, we measured the Lick absorption-line indices and the radial\nvelocities.

In\nthis regime, accretion rate onto neutron star is determined by the ability of\nplasma to enter magnetosphere via Rayleigh-Taylor instability. A gas-dynamic\ntheory of settling accretion is constructed taking into account anisotropic\nturbulence. The angular momentum can be transferred through the quasi-static\nshell via large-scale convective motions initiating turbulence cascade.

In\nthis paper we discuss various ways of using these high resolution data to\nconstrain velocity power spectrum in galaxy clusters. We argue that variations\nof these quantities with the projected distance R in cool core clusters contain\nimportant information on the velocity field length scales in the ICM. The\neffective length $l_{\\rm eff}$ along the line of sight, which provides dominant\ncontribution to the line flux, increases with R, allowing one to probe the\namplitude of the velocity variations at different spatial scales. In\nparticular, we show that the width of the line as a function of R is closely\nlinked to the structure function of the 3D velocity field. Yet another easily\nobtainable proxy of the velocity field length scales is the ratio of the\namplitude of the projected velocity field (line energy) variations to the\ndispersion of the velocity along the line of sight (line width). Finally the\nprojected velocity field can be easily converted into 3D velocity field,\nespecially for clusters like Coma with an extended flat core in the surface\nbrightness. Under assumption of a homogeneous isotropic Gaussian 3D velocity\nfield we derived simple expressions relating the power spectrum of the 3D\nvelocity field (or structure function) and the observables. The uncertainties\nin the observables, caused by stochastic nature of the velocity field, are\nestimated by making multiple realizations of the random Gaussian velocity field\nand evaluating the scatter in observables. If large scale motions are present\nin the ICM these uncertainties may dominate the statistical errors of line\nwidth and shift measurements. \n\n"}

Abstract: Galaxy clusters are among the best targets for indirect dark matter detection\nin gamma-rays, despite the large astrophysical background expected from these\nobjects. Detection is now within reach of current observatories (Fermi-LAT or\nCerenkov telescopes); however, assessing the origin of this signal might be\ndifficult. We investigate whether the behaviour of the number of objects per\n`flux' bin (logN-logF) and that of the stacked signal could be used as a\nsignature of the dominant process at stake.We use the CLUMPY code to integrate\nthe signal from decaying or annihilating dark matter and cosmic rays along the\nline of sight. We assume the standard NFW profile for the dark matter density\nand rely on a parametrised emissivity for the cosmic-ray component. In this\ncontext, the consequences of stacking are explored using the MCXC\nmeta-catalogue of galaxy clusters. We find the value of the slope of the\nlogN-logF power law (or the increase of the signal with the number of stacked\nobjects) to be a clear diagnosis to disentangle decaying dark matter from\ncosmic-ray induced gamma-rays. For dark matter annihilation, depending on the\nsignal boost from the substructures, it is either similar to the cosmic-ray\nsignal (no boost) or similar to the decay case (large boosts). The shift\nbetween the brightest object and its followers also depends on the signal\norigin. For annihilation, this shift and the stacked signal are poorly\nconstrained because of the large uncertainty affecting the boost. We also\nunderline that the angular dependence of the annihilation signal is not\nuniversal because of the substructure contribution. \n\n"}

Abstract: Extended emission gamma-ray bursts are a subset of the `short' class of burst\nwhich exhibit an early time rebrightening of gamma emission in their light\ncurves. This extended emission arises just after the initial emission spike,\nand can persist for up to hundreds of seconds after trigger. When their light\ncurves are overlaid, our sample of 14 extended emission bursts show a\nremarkable uniformity in their evolution, strongly suggesting a common central\nengine powering the emission. One potential central engine capable of this is a\nhighly magnetized, rapidly rotating neutron star, known as a magnetar.\nMagnetars can be formed by two compact objects coallescing, a scenario which is\none of the leading progenitor models for short bursts in general. Assuming a\nmagnetar is formed, we gain a value for the magnetic field and late time spin\nperiod for 9 of the extended emission bursts by fitting the magnetic dipole\nspin-down model of Zhang & Meszaros (2001). Assuming the magnetic field is\nconstant, and the observed energy release during extended emission is entirely\ndue to the spin-down of this magnetar, we then derive the spin period at birth\nfor the sample. We find all birth spin periods are in good agreement with those\npredicted for a newly born magnetar. \n\n"}

According to this suggestion the SN progenitor\nsuffered a rapid expansion within months before explosion. The expansion was\ndriven by leakage of energy from the core where vigorous oxygen nuclear burning\ntakes place within a year prior to explosion. This expansion triggered mass\ntransfer onto the secondary star. Most of the extra energy of the outburst\ncomes from the accretion of ~0.1Mo onto the secondary star. As well, the gas\noutflowing at v~2000 km/s was launched from the accreting secondary star, most\nlikely in a bipolar outflow.

A variable f_col that increases by a factor of\n~ 2.0 - 3.5 as the source transitions from the high/soft state to the low/hard\nstate can adequately explain the observed disc spectral evolution.

{"id": "1307.2890", "contents": "Title: The stability of tidally deformed neutron stars to three- and four-mode\n  coupling Abstract: It has recently been suggested that the tidal deformation of a neutron star\nexcites daughter p- and g-modes to large amplitudes via a quasi-static\ninstability. This would remove energy from the tidal bulge, resulting in\ndissipation and possibly affecting the phase evolution of inspiralling binary\nneutron stars and hence the extraction of binary parameters from gravitational\nwave observations. This instability appears to arise because of a large\nthree-mode interaction among the tidal mode and high-order p- and g-modes of\nsimilar radial wavenumber. We show that additional four-mode interactions enter\ninto the analysis at the same order as the three-mode terms previously\nconsidered. We compute these four-mode couplings by finding a volume-preserving\ncoordinate transformation that relates the energy of a tidally deformed star to\nthat of a radially perturbed spherical star. Using this method, we relate the\nfour-mode coupling to three-mode couplings and show that there is a near-exact\ncancellation between the destabilizing effect of the three-mode interactions\nand the stabilizing effect of the four-mode interaction. We then show that the\nequilibrium tide is stable against the quasi-static decay into daughter p- and\ng-modes to leading order. The leading deviation from the quasi-static\napproximation due to orbital motion of the binary is considered; while it may\nslightly spoil the near-cancellation, any resulting instability timescale is at\nleast of order the gravitational-wave inspiral time. We conclude that the\np-/g-mode coupling does not lead to a quasi-static instability, and does not\nimpact the phase evolution of gravitational waves from binary neutron stars. \n\n"}

HI\ndata revealed these galaxies to be embedded in a common elongated envelope,\npossibly embedded in intravoid filament. In the CosmoGrid simulation we look\nfor systems similar to VGS_31 in mass, size and environment. We find a total of\neight such systems.

The spatial distribution of the haloes\nfollows that of the dark matter environment. We find that VGS_31-like systems\nhave a large variation in formation time, having formed between 10 Gyr ago and\nthe present epoch. However, the environments in which the systems are embedded\nevolved resemble each other substantially. Each of the VGS_31-like systems is\nembedded in an intra-void wall, that no later than z = 0.5 became the only\nprominent feature in its environment.

Therefore this notion has been widely used in the verification of\nHSs. A stronger condition on barrier certificates means that less expressive\nbarrier certificates can be synthesized. On the other hand, synthesizing more\nexpressive barrier certificates often means high complexity. In [9], Kong et al\nconsid- ered how to relax the condition of barrier certificates while still\nkeeping their convexity so that one can synthesize more expressive barrier\ncertificates efficiently using semi-definite programming (SDP). In this paper,\nwe first discuss how to relax the condition of barrier certificates in a\ngeneral way, while still keeping their convexity. Particularly, one can then\nutilize different weaker conditions flexibly to synthesize dif- ferent kinds of\nbarrier certificates with more expressiveness efficiently using SDP. These\nbarriers give more opportuni- ties to verify the considered system.

Depending on the size of the\ncrystalline core and the value of the gap parameter $\\Delta$, we find that the\nfrequencies of the torsional oscillation modes can range from a few hundred\nhertz to a few kilohertz for our canonical $1.4 M_\\odot$ compact star models.\nWe have also studied the prospect for detecting the gravitational-wave signals\nemitted from these modes in a pulsar glitch event.

In this paper we are interested in\nrepresentations of P using the positive semidefinite cone: a positive\nsemidefinite lift (psd lift) of a polytope P is a representation of P as the\nprojection of an affine slice of the positive semidefinite cone\n$\\mathbf{S}^d_+$. Such a representation allows linear optimization problems\nover P to be written as semidefinite programs of size d.

The\nmechanism powering such events is thought to be linked to tapping of the\nangular momentum (spin) of the black hole, the rate of accretion through the\ndisc or some combination of the two. We can attempt to discriminate between\nthese possibilities by comparing proxies for jet power with spin estimates. Due\nto the small number of sources reaching Eddington rates and have therefore been\nsuggested to act as 'standard candles', there has been much recent debate as to\nwhether a significant correlation exists between jet power and spin. We perform\ncontinuum fitting to the high-quality, disc-dominated XMM-Newton spectra of the\nextragalactic microquasar discovered in M31. Assuming prograde spin, we find\nthat, for sensible constraints the spin is always very low (a < 0.15 at\n3-sigma). When combined with a proxy for jet power derived from the maximum 5\nGHz radio luminosity during a bright flaring event, we find that the source\nsits well above the previously reported, rising correlation that would indicate\nthat spin tapping is the dominant mechanism for powering the jets. The notable\nexceptions require the inclination to be improbably small or the jet to be very\nfast. We investigate whether this could be a by-product of selecting\nprograde-only spin, finding that the data statistically favour a substantially\nretrograde spin for the same constraints (a < -0.17 at 3-sigma). Although\ntheoretically improbable, this remarkable finding could be confirmation that\nretrograde spin can power such jets via spin-tapping, as has been suggested for\ncertain radio quasars.

Here, we present a\nthorough statistical analysis of the spin distributions of the various classes\nof millisecond pulsars to assess the evolution of their spin period between the\ndifferent stages. Accreting sources that showed oscillations exclusively during\nthermonuclear type I X-ray bursts (nuclear-powered millisecond pulsars) are\nfound to be significantly faster than rotation-powered sources, while accreting\nsources that possess a magnetosphere and show coherent pulsations (accreting\nmillisecond pulsars) are not. On the other hand, if accreting millisecond\npulsars and eclipsing rotation-powered millisecond pulsars form a common class\nof transitional pulsars, these are shown to have a spin distribution\nintermediate between the faster nuclear-powered millisecond pulsars and the\nslower non-eclipsing rotation-powered millisecond pulsars.

In this work, we\ntest this issue by exploring hard X-ray spectral evolution in four black-hole\nX-ray binaries (XRBs) with multiple, quasi-simultaneous radio and X-ray\nobservations.

Secondly and most importantly, we find that the\nradio-X-ray correlations are also clearly different when the X-ray fluxes are\nhigher and lower than the critical flux that defined by X-ray spectral\nevolution.

The time-averaged spectra in the 1-200\nkeV band are dominated by a hard power-law component of a photon index of\n\\approx 1.6 with a high-energy cutoff at \\approx 60 keV, which is well\ndescribed with Comptonization of the disk emission by hot corona. We estimate\nthe inner disk radius from the multi-color disk component, and find that it is\n1.3-2.3 times larger than the radius in the high/soft state. This suggests that\nthe standard disk was not extended to the innermost stable circular orbit. A\nreflection component from the disk is detected with R = \\Omega/2\\pi \\approx 0.6\n(\\Omega is the solid angle). We also successfully estimate the stable disk\ncomponent in a way independent of the time-averaged spectral modeling, by\nanalyzing short-term spectral variability on the \\sim 1-sec timescale. A weak\nlow-frequency quasi-periodic oscillation (LF QPO) at 0.1-0.2 Hz is detected,\nwhose frequency is found to correlate with the X-ray luminosity and photon\nindex.

GRBs are rare in the universe, and their progenitor stars are thought to\npossess unique physical properties such as low metal content and rapid\nrotation, while the supernovae (SNe) that are associated with GRBs are expected\nto be highly aspherical. To date, it has been unclear whether GRB-SNe could be\nused as standardizable candles, with contrasting conclusions found by different\nteams. In this paper I present evidence that GRB-SNe have the potential to be\nused as standardizable candles, and show that a statistically significant\nrelation exists between the brightness and width of their decomposed light\ncurves relative to a template supernova. Every single nearby spectroscopically\nidentified GRB-SN, for which the rest-frame and host contributions have been\naccurately determined, follows this relation. Additionally, it is shown that\nnot only GRB-SNe, but perhaps all supernovae whose explosion is powered by a\ncentral engine, may eventually be used as a standardizable candle.

The scalar $\\lambda$ yields the mean payoff per time unit, and\nthe vector $u$, called the bias, allows one to determine optimal stationary\nstrategies. The existence of the eigenpair $(u,\\lambda)$ is generally related\nto ergodicity conditions. A basic issue is to understand for which classes of\ngames the bias vector is unique (up to an additive constant).

We selected and analysed a number of multi--peaked\nCGRO/BATSE GRBs and simulated similar time profiles, with the crucial\ndifference that we assumed exponentially distributed interpulse times, as is\nexpected for a memoryless stationary Poisson process. We then identified peaks\nin both data sets using a novel peak search algorithm, which is more efficient\nthan others used in the past.

The meson masses in this model are in very good agreement with lattice\ngauge theory calculations in the quenched approximation. We show that the key\ningredient for the meson mass predictions is the running of the anomalous\ndimension of the quark condensate, gamma. This provides an explanation for the\nagreement of holographic and quenched lattice gauge theory calculations. We\nthen study the `Dynamic AdS/QCD model' in which the gauge theory dynamics is\nincluded by a choice for the running of gamma. We use the naive two-loop\nperturbative running of the gauge coupling extrapolated to the non-perturbative\nregime to estimate the running of gamma across a number of theories. We\nconsider models with quarks in the fundamental, adjoint, two-index symmetric\nand two-index anti-symmetric representations. We display predictions for M_rho,\nM_pi, M_sigma and the lightest glueball mass. Many of these theories, where the\ncontribution to the running of gamma is dominated by the gluons, give very\nsimilar spectra, which also match with lattice expectations for QCD. On the\nother hand, a significant difference between spectra in different holographic\nmodels is seen for theories where the quark content changes the gradient of the\nrunning of gamma around the scale at which chiral symmetry breaking is\ntriggered at gamma approximately 1. For these walking theories we see an\nenhancement of the rho-mass and a suppression of the sigma-mass. Both phenomena\nare characteristic for walking behaviour in the physical meson masses. \n\n"}

The resulting theory\nconsiderably differs from LQG as well as from formulations that bound the\nprobability of violating state constraints. We develop results for optimal\nstate-feedback control in the two cases where i) steering of the state\ndistribution is to take place over a finite window of time with minimum energy,\nand ii) the goal is to maintain the state at a stationary distribution over an\ninfinite horizon with minimum power. For both problems the distribution of\nnoise and state are Gaussian. In the first case, we show that provided the\nsystem is controllable, the state can be steered to any terminal Gaussian\ndistribution over any specified finite time-interval. In the second case, we\ncharacterize explicitly the covariance of admissible stationary state\ndistributions that can be maintained with constant state-feedback control. The\nconditions for optimality are expressed in terms of a system of dynamically\ncoupled Riccati equations in the finite horizon case and in terms of algebraic\nconditions for the stationary case.

Although initially the jet is kinematically dominated, we have\nconsidered axial, toroidal and helical magnetic fields to investigate the\neffects of different magnetic-field topologies and strengths on the\nrecollimation structures.

How neutron star magnetospheric activities affect these two\nphenomena are investigated by using the wind braking model of pulsars.

Such solutions are often difficult to find in\nbeyond-general-relativity theories due to the inclusion of additional fields\nthat couple to the metric non-linearly and non-minimally. In this paper, we\nconsider rotating black hole solutions in one such theory, dynamical\nChern-Simons gravity, where the Einstein-Hilbert action is modified by the\nintroduction of a dynamical scalar field that couples to the metric through the\nPontryagin density. We treat dynamical Chern-Simons gravity as an effective\nfield theory and work in the decoupling limit, where corrections are treated as\nsmall perturbations from general relativity. We perturb about the\nmaximally-rotating Kerr solution, the so-called extremal limit, and develop\nmathematical insight into the analysis techniques needed to construct solutions\nfor generic spin.

Examples of complex specifications of interest include\nproperties expressed as formulae in linear temporal logic (LTL) or as automata\non infinite strings. A general methodology to synthesize controllers for such\nproperties resorts to symbolic abstractions of the given stochastic systems.\nSymbolic models are discrete abstractions of the given concrete systems with\nthe property that a controller designed on the abstraction can be refined (or\nimplemented) into a controller on the original system. Although the recent\ndevelopment of techniques for the construction of symbolic models has been\nquite encouraging, the general goal of formal synthesis over stochastic control\nsystems is by no means solved. A fundamental issue with the existing techniques\nis the known \"curse of dimensionality,\" which is due to the need to discretize\nstate and input sets and that results in an exponential complexity over the\nnumber of state and input variables in the concrete system. In this work we\npropose a novel abstraction technique for incrementally stable stochastic\ncontrol systems, which does not require state-space discretization but only\ninput set discretization, and that can be potentially more efficient (and thus\nscalable) than existing approaches.

The plant and controller are open quantum\nsystems interconnected through bosonic quantum fields. In comparison with the\nobservation-actuation structure of classical controllers, coherent quantum\nfeedback is less invasive to the quantum dynamics. The plant and controller\nvariables satisfy the canonical commutation relations (CCRs) of a quantum\nharmonic oscillator and are governed by linear quantum stochastic differential\nequations (QSDEs). In order to correspond to such oscillators, these QSDEs must\nsatisfy physical realizability (PR) conditions in the form of quadratic\nconstraints on the state-space matrices, reflecting the CCR preservation in\ntime. The symmetry of the problem is taken into account by introducing\nequivalence classes of coherent quantum controllers generated by symplectic\nsimilarity transformations.

Such epidemics are described by $2^n$- or\n$3^n$-state Markov chains. Ostensibly, because analyzing such Markov chains is\ntoo complicated, their $O(n)$-dimensional nonlinear \"mean-field\" approximation,\nand its linearization, are often studied instead. We provide a complete global\nanalysis of the epidemic dynamics of the nonlinear mean-field approximation. In\nparticular, we show that depending on the largest eigenvalue of the underlying\ngraph adjacency matrix and the rates of infection, recovery, and vaccination,\nthe global dynamics takes on one of two forms: either the epidemic dies out, or\nit converges to another unique fixed point (the so-called endemic state where a\nconstant fraction of the nodes remain infected). A similar result has also been\nshown in the continuous-time case. We tie in these results with the \"true\"\nunderlying Markov chain model by showing that the linear model is the tightest\nupper-bound on the true probabilities of infection that involves only\nmarginals, and that, even though the nonlinear model is not an upper-bound on\nthe true probabilities in general, it does provide an upper-bound on the\nprobability of the chain not being absorbed. As a consequence, we also show\nthat when the disease-free fixed point is globally stable for the mean-field\nmodel, the Markov chain has an $O(\\log n)$ mixing time, which means the\nepidemic dies out quickly.

The afterglow position is\ncoincident with the disk of a galaxy ESO 580-49 at z= 0.01326 (~1\" from its\ncenter), which makes GRB 111005A the second closest GRB known to date, after\nGRB 980425. The radio afterglow of GRB 111005A was an order of magnitude less\nluminous than those of local low-luminosity GRBs, and obviously than those of\ncosmological GRBs. The radio flux was approximately constant and then\nexperienced an unusually rapid decay a month after the GRB explosion. Similarly\nto only two other GRBs, we did not find the associated supernovae (SN), despite\ndeep near- and mid-infrared observations 1-9 days after the GRB explosion,\nreaching ~20 times fainter than other SNe associated with GRBs. Moreover, we\nmeasured twice solar metallicity for the GRB location. The low gamma-ray and\nradio luminosities, rapid decay, lack of a SN, and super-solar metallicity\nsuggest that GRB 111005A represents a different rare class of GRBs than typical\ncore-collapse events.

This idea has been studied heavily both in physics and in other\ndisciplines, and the answer depends strongly on both the model for opinions and\nfor the network structure on which the opinions evolve. One model that was\ncreated to study consensus formation quantitatively is the Deffuant model, in\nwhich the opinion distribution of a population evolves via sequential random\npairwise encounters.

Filaments which experience a weakly turbulent accretion\nflow fragment in a two-tier hierarchical fashion, similar to the fragmentation\npattern seen in the Orion Integral Shaped Filament. Increasing the energy in\nthe turbulent velocity field results in more sub-structure within the\nfilaments, and one sees a shift from gravity-dominated fragmentation to\nturbulence-dominated fragmentation.

The pericenters of the orbits\nperform a random walk, and we consider cases where this random walk slowly\nbrings the binary to the Hills tidal separation radius (the so-called empty\nloss-cone regime). However, we find that in a majority of cases the expected\nseparation does not occur and instead the members of the binary merge together.\nThis happens because the binary's eccentricity is excited by tidal interactions\nwith the MBH, and the relative excursions of the internal eccentricity of the\nbinary far exceed those in its internal semimajor axis.

While\nthere has been a large body of research in this area, most approaches that\nexist today require a symbolic representation of motions (e.g. in the form of\nmotion primitives), which have to be defined a-priori or require complex\nsegmentation algorithms. In contrast, recent advances in the field of neural\nnetworks and especially deep learning have demonstrated that sub-symbolic\nrepresentations that can be learned end-to-end usually outperform more\ntraditional approaches, for applications such as machine translation.

To examine such situations, we introduce the idea of\na timer into threshold models of social influence. The presence of timers on\nnodes delays the adoption --- i.e., change of state --- of each agent, which in\nturn delays the adoptions of its neighbors. With a homogeneous-distributed\ntimer, in which all nodes exhibit the same amount of delay, adoption delays are\nalso homogeneous, so the adoption order of nodes remains the same. However,\nheterogeneously-distributed timers can change the adoption order of nodes and\nhence the \"adoption paths\" through which state changes spread in a network.\nUsing a threshold model of social contagions, we illustrate that heterogeneous\ntimers can either accelerate or decelerate the spread of adoptions compared to\nan analogous situation with homogeneous timers, and we investigate the\nrelationship of such acceleration or deceleration with respect to timer\ndistribution and network structure.

This scenario is able to explain the recent measurements reported by\nAMS on the antiproton/proton ratio, that is found to be remarkably constant at\n~60-450 GeV of kinetic energy. However, as we will show, this explanation is\nruled out by the new AMS data on the B/C ratio, which is found to decrease\nsteadily up to TeV/n energies. With the constraints provided by the two ratios,\nwe calculate conservative (B/C driven) and speculative (pbar/p driven)\nSNR-induced flux contribution for the spectra of antideuteron and antihelium in\nCRs, along with their standard secondary component expected from CR collisions\nin the interstellar gas.

In\nthis paper, we explore how \\textit{anti-establishment} nodes (e.g.,\n\\textit{hipsters}) influence the spreading dynamics of two competing products.\nWe consider a model in which spreading follows a deterministic rule for\nupdating node states (which describe which product has been adopted) in which\nan adjustable fraction $p_{\\rm Hip}$ of the nodes in a network are hipsters,\nwho choose to adopt the product that they believe is the less popular of the\ntwo. The remaining nodes are conformists, who choose which product to adopt by\nconsidering which products their immediate neighbors have adopted. We simulate\nour model on both synthetic and real networks, and we show that the hipsters\nhave a major effect on the final fraction of people who adopt each product:\neven when only one of the two products exists at the beginning of the\nsimulations, a very small fraction of hipsters in a network can still cause the\nother product to eventually become the more popular one. To account for this\nbehavior, we construct an approximation for the steady-state adoption fraction\non $k$-regular trees in the limit of few hipsters. Additionally, our\nsimulations demonstrate that a time delay $\\tau$ in the knowledge of the\nproduct distribution in a population, as compared to immediate knowledge of\nproduct adoption among nearest neighbors, can have a large effect on the final\ndistribution of product adoptions.

This\narticle examines the use of an iteratively-learned feedforward command to\nimprove position tracking when using SEAs. Over each iteration, the output\nresponses of the system to the quantized inputs are used to estimate a\nlinearized local system models. These estimated models are obtained using a\ncomplex-valued Gaussian Process Regression (cGPR) technique and then, used to\ngenerate a new feedforward input command based on the previous iteration's\nerror. This article illustrates this iterative machine learning (IML) technique\nfor a two degree of freedom (2-DOF) robotic arm, and demonstrates successful\nconvergence of the IML approach to reduce the tracking error. \n\n"}

We estimate the total amount of diffuse\nionised gas to be of the order of (~5+-3)x10^10 Msun and explore its physical\nproperties to understand its origin and the source(s) of the ionisation. The\nMUSE data allow the identification of a dozen of group members embedded in this\nstructure from emission and absorption lines. We extracted spectra from small\napertures defined for both the diffuse ionised gas and the galaxies. We\ninvestigated the kinematics and ionisation properties of the various galaxies\nand extended gas regions thanks to line diagnostics (R23, O32 and\n[OIII]/H\\beta) available within the MUSE wavelength range. We compared these\ndiagnostics to photo-ionisation models and shock models. The structure is\ndivided in two kinematically distinct sub-structures. The most extended\nsub-structure of ionised gas is likely rotating around a massive galaxy and\ndisplays filamentary patterns linking some galaxies. The second sub-structure\nlinks another massive galaxy hosting an Active Galactic Nucleus to a low mass\ngalaxy but also extends orthogonally to the AGN host disk over ~35 kpc. This\nextent is likely ionised by the AGN itself. The location of small diffuse\nregions in the R23 vs. O32 diagram is compatible with photo-ionisation.\nHowever, the location of three of these regions in this diagram (low O32, high\nR23) can also be explained by shocks, which is supported by their large\nvelocity dispersions. One edge-on galaxy shares the same properties and may be\na source of shocks. Whatever the hypothesis, the extended gas seems to be non\nprimordial. We favour a scenario where the gas has been extracted from galaxies\nby tidal forces and AGN triggered by interactions between at least the two\nsub-structures. \n\n"}

We carried out sensitive observations with the IRAM 30m telescope\nof a sample of 25 C-rich AGB stars to search for emission lines of SiC2, SiC,\nand Si2C in the 2 mm band. We performed non-LTE excitation and radiative\ntransfer calculations based on the LVG method to model the observed lines of\nSiC2 and to derive SiC2 fractional abundances in the observed envelopes. We\ndetect SiC2 in most of the sources, SiC in about half of them, and do not\ndetect Si2C in any source, at the exception of IRC +10216. Most of these\ndetections are reported for the first time in this work. We find a positive\ncorrelation between the SiC and SiC2 line emission, which suggests that both\nspecies are chemically linked, the SiC radical probably being the\nphotodissociation product of SiC2 in the external layer of the envelope. We\nfind a clear trend in which the denser the envelope, the less abundant SiC2 is.\nThe observed trend is interpreted as an evidence of efficient incorporation of\nSiC2 onto dust grains, a process which is favored at high densities owing to\nthe higher rate at which collisions between particles take place. The observed\nbehavior of a decline in the SiC2 abundance with increasing density strongly\nsuggests that SiC2 is an important gas-phase precursor of SiC dust in envelopes\naround carbon stars. \n\n"}

We investigate optical transients from the\nbirth of BBHs powered by the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion onto the primary\nBH, which occur $\\sim1-10$ Gyr earlier than gravitational wave signals at the\nBH-BH merger. When the secondary massive star collapses into a BH, it may eject\na fraction of its outer material and may form a disk around the primary BH and\ninduces a powerful disk wind. These primary-induced winds can lead to optical\ntransients with a kinetic energy of $\\sim10^{47}-3\\times10^{48}$ erg, an ejecta\nvelocity of $10^8-10^9\\rm~cm~s^{-1}$, a duration of a few days, and an absolute\nmagnitude ranging from about $-11$ to $-14$.

We highlight that for a dynamics on a particular graph there may be\nmultiple coarse grained descriptions that capture different, incomparable\nfeatures of the original process. For instance, a coarse graining induced by\none partition may be commensurate with a time-scale separation in the dynamics,\nwhile another coarse graining may correspond to a different lower-dimensional\ndynamics that preserves the Markov property of the original process. Taking\ninspiration from the literature of Computational Mechanics, we find that a\nconvenient tool to summarise and visualise such dynamical properties of a\ncoarse grained model (partition) is the entrogram.

The\nfirst measure is concerned with energy metrics, namely the $\\Hcal_2$--norm of a\nnetwork, which arises in control theory applications. The second measure is\nconcerned with the notion of \"tail risk\" which arises in economic and financial\nnetworks. We study the question of why such performance measures may\ndeteriorate at a faster rate than the growth rate of the network. We first\nfocus on the energy metric and its well known connection to controllability\nGramian of the underlying dynamical system. We show that undirected networks\nexhibit the most graceful energy growth rates as network size grows. This rate\nis quantified completely by the proximity of spectral radius to unity or\ndistance to instability. In contrast, we show that the simple characterization\nof energy in terms of network spectrum does not exist for directed networks. We\ndemonstrate that, for any fixed distance to instability, energy of a directed\nnetwork can grow at an exponentially faster rate. We provide general methods\nfor manipulating networks to reduce energy. In particular, we prove that\ncertain operations that increase the symmetry in a network cannot increase\nenergy (in an order sense).

In contrast to $\\Hcal_2$--norm which arises from computing\nthe expectation of energy in the network, tail risk focuses on tail probability\nbehavior of network variables. Although the two measures differ substantially\nwe show that they are precisely connected through the system Gramian.

We find that the observational\nproperties depend mainly on the mass of the exploding object, even if the\nangular momentum evolution after the end of the mass accretion phase and before\nthe onset of C-burning plays a non-negligible role. Just before the explosion\nthe magnitude M_V ranges between 9 and 11 mag, while the colour (F225W-F555W)\nis about -1.64 mag. The photometric properties remain constant for a few\ndecades before the explosion. During the last few months the luminosity\ndecreases very rapidly. The corresponding decline in the optical bands varies\nfrom few hundredths up to one magnitude, the exact value depending on both the\nWD total mass and the braking efficiency at the end of the mass transfer. This\nfeature is related to the exponentially increasing energy production which\ndrives the formation of a convective core rapidly extending over a large part\nof the exploding object.

Abstract: The latest observations of extensive air showers (EAS) induced by\nultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECR) appear to indicate, prima facie, a\ntransition to heavy primaries at the highest energies. However, this\ninterpretation, which is based on extrapolations of the Standard Model (SM) to\nultra-LHC energies, is strained from both astrophysical and particle\nphenomenology perspectives. We consider the alternative that after some energy\nthreshold, the first collision of the primary in the atmosphere results in a\nstate, the decay of which leads to a considerably increased shower particle\nmultiplicity, so that light-primary EAS appear heavy-like. We show that a\nminimal implementation of such a model yields predictions for the average EAS\ndepth and shower-to-shower fluctuations that are consistent with each other,\nand an excellent fit to Auger data.

In existing studies, mixing is\ngenerated by maps that repeat the same cut-and-shuffle process at every\niteration, in a \"fixed\" manner. However, mixing can be greatly improved by\nvarying the cut-and-shuffle parameters at each step, using a \"variable\"\napproach. To demonstrate this approach, we show how to optimize mixing by\ncutting-and-shuffling on the one-dimensional line interval, known as an\ninterval exchange transformation (IET). Mixing can be significantly improved by\noptimizing variable protocols, especially for initial conditions more complex\nthan just a simple two-color line interval. While we show that optimal variable\nIETs can be found analytically for arbitrary numbers of iterations, for more\ncomplex cutting-and-shuffling systems, computationally expensive numerical\noptimization methods would be required. Furthermore, the number of control\nparameters grows linearly with the number of iterations in variable systems.\nTherefore, optimizing over large numbers of iterations is generally\ncomputationally prohibitive. We demonstrate an ad hoc approach to\ncutting-and-shuffling that is computationally inexpensive and guarantees the\nmixing metric is within a constant factor of the optimum. This ad hoc approach\nyields significantly better mixing than fixed IETs which are known to produce\nweak-mixing, because cut pieces never reconnect. The heuristic principles of\nthis method can be applied to more general cutting-and-shuffling systems. \n\n"}

The scheme verifies safety of a proposed learning-based input and\nmodifies it as little as necessary in order to keep the system within a given\nset of constraints. Safety is thereby related to the existence of a model\npredictive controller (MPC) providing a feasible trajectory towards a safe\ntarget set. A robust MPC formulation accounts for the fact that the model is\ngenerally uncertain in the context of learning, which allows proving constraint\nsatisfaction at all times under the proposed MPSC strategy. The MPSC scheme can\nbe used in order to expand any potentially conservative set of safe states for\nlearning and we prove an iterative technique for enlarging the safe set.\nFinally, a practical data-based design procedure for MPSC is proposed using\nscenario optimization. \n\n"}

In this chapter, we present two control\nstrategies for model predictive control of nonlinear PDEs using data-efficient\napproximations of the Koopman operator. In the first one, the dynamic control\nsystem is replaced by a small number of autonomous systems with different yet\nconstant inputs. The control problem is consequently transformed into a\nswitching problem. In the second approach, a bilinear surrogate model, is\nobtained via linear interpolation between two of these autonomous systems.\nUsing a recent convergence result for Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition\n(EDMD), convergence to the true optimum can be proved. We study the properties\nof these two strategies with respect to solution quality, data requirements,\nand complexity of the resulting optimization problem using the 1D Burgers\nEquation and the 2D Navier-Stokes Equations as examples. Finally, an extension\nfor online adaptivity is presented. \n\n"}

While radio bubbles inflated by AGN jets\ncould be dynamically supported by cosmic rays (CRs), the impact of CR-dominated\njets are not well understood. In this work, we perform three-dimensional\nsimulations of CR-jet feedback in an isolated cluster atmosphere; we find that\nCR jets impact the multiphase gas differently than jets dominated by kinetic\nenergy. In particular, CR bubbles can more efficiently uplift the cluster gas\nand cause an outward expansion of the hot ICM. Due to adiabatic cooling from\nthe expansion and less efficient heating from CR bubbles by direct mixing, the\nICM is more prone to local thermal instabilities, which will later enhance\nchaotic cold accretion onto the AGN. The amount of cold gas formed during the\nbubble formation and its late-time evolution sensitively depend on whether CR\ntransport processes are included or not.

They occur in biological models because of diffusion effects or as\nsimplifying modeling elements. We propose here to consider delayed stochastic\nreaction networks. The difficulty here lies in the fact that the state-space of\na delayed reaction network is infinite-dimensional, which makes their analysis\nmore involved. We demonstrate here that a particular class of stochastic\ntime-varying delays, namely those that follow a phase-type distribution, can be\nexactly implemented in terms of a chemical reaction network. Hence, any\ndelay-free network can be augmented to incorporate those delays through the\naddition of delay-species and delay-reactions. Hence, for this class of\nstochastic delays, which can be used to approximate any delay distribution\narbitrarily accurately, the state-space remains finite-dimensional and,\ntherefore, standard tools developed for standard reaction network still apply.\nIn particular, we demonstrate that for unimolecular mass-action reaction\nnetworks that the delayed stochastic reaction network is ergodic if and only if\nthe non-delayed network is ergodic as well. Bimolecular reactions are more\ndifficult to consider but an analogous result is also obtained. These results\ntell us that delays that are phase-type distributed, regardless of their\ndistribution, are not harmful to the ergodicity property of reaction networks.\nWe also prove that the presence of those delays adds convolution terms in the\nmoment equation but does not change the value of the stationary means compared\nto the delay-free case. Finally, the control of a certain class of delayed\nstochastic reaction network using a delayed antithetic integral controller is\nconsidered. It is proven that this controller achieves its goal provided that\nthe delay-free network satisfy the conditions of ergodicity and\noutput-controllability. \n\n"}

Unfortunately, long-term variability of dM stars has not been extensively\nstudied, due to their low intrinsic brightness. For this reason, in 1999 we\nstarted the HKalpha project, which systematically observes the spectra of a\nlarge number of stars, in particular dM stars, at the Complejo Astronomico El\nLeoncito (CASLEO).

In the context of\nthe interaction model of the formation of active galactic nuclei (AGN), it has\nbeen proposed that AGN form via \"minor mergers\" of large disk galaxies with\nsmaller companions. We test this hypothesis by comparing the nuclear spectra of\n105 bright nearby galaxies with measurements of their R or r band morphological\nasymmetries at three successive radii. We find no significant differences in\nthese asymmetries between the 13 Seyfert galaxies in the sample and galaxies\nhaving other nuclear spectral types (absorption, H II-region like, LINER), nor\nis there strong qualitative evidence that such mergers have occured among any\nof the Seyferts or LINERs.

Such a drop is expected in models in which the halo\nprofile is very concentrated, so that it declines steeper than isothermal at\nlarge radii. This large drop can be explained as a result of both a\nconcentrated dark matter profile and a significant stellar contribution to the\nrotation velocity at the optical radii. We model the stellar component with a\nthin rotationally supported disk or a Hernquist profile and use adiabatic dark\nmatter response model to place limits on the halo concentration as a function\nof the stellar mass to light ratio. For reasonable values of the latter we find\nconcentrations consistent with CDM predictions, suggesting there is no evidence\nfor low concentrations for the majority of halos in the universe.

These results\nagree with the theoretical expectation about the qualitative behaviour of the\n\"correction terms\" introduced by the hydrodynamic approach: these terms act as\na drain of inflow kinetic energy and a source of vorticity by the small-scale\ntidal torques and shear stresses. \n\n"}

Spectrophotometry was obtained every 1-4 months for 7.5 years, yielding\n20-70 observing epochs per object. Both the continuum and emission line fluxes\nof all of the quasars were observed to change during the duration of the\nobserving program.
