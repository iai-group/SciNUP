Such intermediate mass\nratio inspirals (IMRIs) are most likely to be found in globular clusters. We\nanalyze four possible IMRI formation mechanisms: (1) hardening of an NS-IMBH or\nBH-IMBH binary via three-body interactions, (2) hardening via Kozai resonance\nin a hierarchical triple system, (3) direct capture, and (4) inspiral of a\ncompact object from a tidally captured main-sequence star; we also discuss\ntidal effects when the inspiraling object is an NS. For each mechanism we\npredict the typical eccentricities of the resulting IMRIs. We find that IMRIs\nwill have largely circularized by the time they enter the sensitivity band of\nground-based detectors. Hardening of a binary via three-body interactions,\nwhich is likely to be the dominant mechanism for IMRI formation, yields\neccentricities under 10^-4 when the GW frequency reaches 10 Hz. Even among\nIMRIs formed via direct captures, which can have the highest eccentricities,\naround 90% will circularize to eccentricities under 0.1 before the GW frequency\nreaches 10 Hz. We estimate the rate of IMRI coalescences in globular clusters\nand the sensitivity of a network of three Advanced LIGO detectors to the\nresulting GWs. We show that this detector network may see up to tens of IMRIs\nper year, although rates of one to a few per year may be more plausible. We\nalso estimate the loss in signal-to-noise ratio that will result from using\ncircular IMRI templates for data analysis and find that, for the eccentricities\nwe expect, this loss is negligible. \n\n"}

The spherically symmetric black hole solutions for an arbitrary\ncosmological constant, which represent the generalization of the standard\nSchwarzschild-(A)dS solution, has also been obtained for the Horava-Lifshitz\ntheory.

Abstract: Naked singularities are hypothetical astrophysical objects, characterized by\na gravitational singularity without an event horizon. Penrose has proposed a\nconjecture, according to which there exists a cosmic censor who forbids the\noccurrence of naked singularities. Distinguishing between astrophysical black\nholes and naked singularities is a major challenge for present day\nobservational astronomy. A possibility of differentiating naked singularities\nfrom black holes is through the comparative study of thin accretion disks\nproperties around rotating naked singularities and Kerr-type black holes,\nrespectively. In the present paper, we consider accretion disks around rotating\nnaked singularities, obtained as solutions of the field equations in the\nEinstein-massless scalar field theory. A first major difference between\nrotating naked singularities and Kerr black holes is in the frame dragging\neffect, the angular velocity of a rotating naked singularity being inversely\nproportional to its spin parameter. Due to the differences in the exterior\ngeometry, the thermodynamic and electromagnetic properties of the disks are\ndifferent for these two classes of compact objects, consequently giving clear\nobservational signatures that could discriminate between black holes and naked\nsingularities. For specific values of the spin parameter and of the scalar\ncharge, the energy flux from the disk around a rotating naked singularity can\nexceed by several orders of magnitude the flux from the disk of a Kerr black\nhole. The conversion efficiency of the accreting mass into radiation by\nrotating naked singularities is always higher than the conversion efficiency\nfor black holes. Thus, these observational signatures may provide the necessary\ntools from clearly distinguishing rotating naked singularities from Kerr-type\nblack holes. \n\n"}

We derive\nexpressions for the energy and angular momentum of a particle on a circular\nequatorial orbit around the black hole and compute the locations of the\ninnermost stable circular orbit and the circular photon orbit. We demonstrate\nthat these orbits change significantly for even moderate deviations from the\nKerr metric. The properties of our metric make it an ideally suited spacetime\nto carry out strong-field tests of the no-hair theorem in the electromagnetic\nspectrum using the properties of accretion flows around astrophysical black\nholes of arbitrary spin. \n\n"}

(2) these calculations typically require\nthat numerical waveforms already exist, while we develop an algorithm to\nestimate hybrid mismatches errors without numerical data.

The astrophysical signature of these objects may be\nused to probe fundamental particle physics, or even to provide an alternative\ndescription of compact objects in active galactic nuclei.

The\ninward motion of this \"test probe\" encodes unique information about the nature\nof the central, supermassive DM configuration. When the probe travels through\nsome compact DM profile we show that, within a Newtonian approximation, the\nquasi-adiabatic evolution of the inspiral is mainly driven by DM accretion into\nthe small compact object and by dynamical friction, rather than by\ngravitational-wave radiation-reaction.

Our\narguments are based on nearly-resonant interactions of the R mode with pairs of\n\"daughter modes\". The amplitude of the R mode saturates at the lowest value for\nwhich parametric instability leads to significant excitation of a particular\npair of daughters. The lower bound on this limiting amplitude is proportional\nto the damping rate of the daughter modes that are excited parametrically.\nBased on this picture, we show that if modes damp because of dissipation in a\nvery thin boundary layer at the crust-core boundary then spin up to frequencies\nlarger than about 300 Hz does not occur. Within this conventional scenario the\nR mode saturates at an amplitude that is too large for angular momentum gain\nfrom accretion to overcome gravitational loss to gravitational radiation. We\nconclude that lower dissipation is required for spin up to frequencies much\nhigher than 300 Hz. We conjecture that if the transition from the fluid core to\nthe crystalline crust occurs over a distance much longer than 1 cm then a sharp\nviscous boundary layer fails to form. In this case, damping is due to shear\nviscosity dissipation integrated over the entire star; the rate is slower than\nif a viscous boundary layer forms.

The resulting saturation amplitudes are low enough to permit spin\nup to higher frequencies. Further, we show that the requirement that the lowest\nparametric instability amplitude be small enough to allow continued spin up\nimposes an upper bound to the frequencies that may be attained via accretion\nthat may plausibly be about 750 Hz.

As expected, the differential rotation is responsible\nfor the shearing of the poloidal field and the consequent linear growth in time\nof the toroidal magnetic field. The latter rapidly exceeds in strength the\noriginal poloidal one, leading to a magnetic-field amplification in the the\nstars. Weak initial magnetic fields, i.e. $ \\lesssim 10^{15}$ G, have\nnegligible effects on the development of the dynamical bar-mode instability,\nsimply braking the stellar configuration via magnetic-field shearing, and over\na timescale for which we derived a simple algebraic expression.

A\ncharged or massive particle moving in a curved background space-time produces a\nfield that affects its motion, pushing it off its expected geodesic. This\nself-field gives rise to a so-called self-force acting on the particle. In\nmodelling this motion, the self-force approach uses a perturbative expansion in\nthe mass ratio. One of the most interesting sources of gravitational waves are\nextreme mass ratio inspirals - systems perfectly suited to self-force\nmodelling. One of the key problems within the self-force model is the\ndivergence of the field at the particle. To resolve this, the field is split\ninto a singular component and a smooth regular field. This regular-singular\nsplit, introduced by Detweiler and Whiting, is used in most modern self-force\ncalculations. In this thesis, we derive high-order expansions of the\nDetweiler-Whiting singular field, and use these to push the boundaries on\ncurrent precision limits of self-force calculations.

It is widely believed that the singularity must\nbe removed by quantum gravity effects. Some static quantum-inspired\nsingularity-free black hole solutions have been proposed in the literature, but\nwhen one considers simple examples of gravitational collapse the classical\nsingularity is replaced by a bounce, after which the collapsing matter expands\nfor ever. We may expect 3 possible explanations: $i)$ the static regular black\nhole solutions are not physical, in the sense that they cannot be realized in\nNature, $ii)$ the final product of the collapse is not unique, but it depends\non the initial conditions, or $iii)$ boundary effects play an important role\nand our simple models miss important physics. In the latter case, after proper\nadjustment, the bouncing solution would approach the static one. We argue that\nthe \"correct answer\" may be related to the appearance of a ghost state in de\nSitter spacetimes with super Planckian mass. Our black holes have indeed a de\nSitter core and the ghost would make these configurations unstable. Therefore\nwe believe that these black hole static solutions represent the transient phase\nof a gravitational collapse, but never survive as asymptotic states. \n\n"}

With the advent of\ngravitational-wave (GW) astronomy, environmental effects on the GW signal will\neventually have to be quantified. Here we present a wide survey of the\ncorrections due to these effects in two situations of great interest for GW\nastronomy: the black hole (BH) ringdown emission and the inspiral of two\ncompact objects. We take into account various effects such as: electric\ncharges, magnetic fields, cosmological evolution, possible deviations from\nGeneral Relativity, firewalls, and various forms of matter such as accretion\ndisks and dark matter halos. Our analysis predicts the existence of resonances\ndictated by the external mass distribution, which dominate the very late-time\nbehavior of merger/ringdown waveforms. The mode structure can drastically\ndiffer from the vacuum case, yet the BH response to external perturbations is\nunchanged at the time scales relevant for detectors. This is because although\nthe vacuum Schwarzschild resonances are no longer quasinormal modes of the\nsystem, they still dominate the response at intermediate times. Our results\nstrongly suggest that both parametrized and ringdown searches should use at\nleast two-mode templates. Our analysis of compact binaries shows that\nenvironmental effects are typically negligible for most eLISA sources, with the\nexception of very few special extreme mass ratio inspirals. We show in\nparticular that accretion and hydrodynamic drag generically dominate over\nself-force effects for geometrically thin disks, whereas they can be safely\nneglected for geometrically thick disk environments, which are the most\nrelevant for eLISA. Finally, we discuss how our ignorance of the matter\nsurrounding compact objects implies intrinsic limits on the ability to\nconstrain strong-field deviations from General Relativity. \n\n"}

One such effect gives a systematic shift in\nthe distance-redshift relation away from its background value, due to the non-\nlinear relativistic conservation of total photon flux. We also show directly\nhow this shift follows from a fully relativistic analysis of the geodesic\ndeviation equation. We derive the expectation value of the shift using\nsecond-order perturbations about a concordance background, and show that the\ndistance to last scattering is increased by 1%. We argue that neglecting this\nshift could lead to a significant bias in the background cosmological\nparameters, because it alters the meaning of the background model. A naive\nadjustment of CMB parameter estimation if this shift is really a correction to\nthe background would raise the H0 value inferred from the CMB by 5%,\npotentially removing the tension with local measurements of H0. Other CMB\nparameters which depend on the distance would also be shifted by ~1sigma when\ncombined with local H0 data.

Recent progress in modelling these\nsignals relies on an approximate decoupling between the non-precessing secular\ninspiral and a precession-induced rotation. However, the latter depends in\ngeneral on all physical parameters of the binary which makes modelling efforts\nas well as understanding parameter-estimation prospects prohibitively complex.\nHere we show that the dominant precession effects can be captured by a reduced\nset of spin parameters. Specifically, we introduce a single \\emph{effective\nprecession spin} parameter, $\\chi_p$, which is defined from the spin components\nthat lie in the orbital plane at some (arbitrary) instant during the inspiral.\nWe test the efficacy of this parameter by considering binary inspiral\nconfigurations specified by the physical parameters of a corresponding\nnon-precessing-binary configuration (total mass, mass ratio, and spin\ncomponents (anti-)parallel to the orbital angular momentum), plus the effective\nprecession spin applied to the larger black hole. We show that for an\noverwhelming majority of random precessing configurations, the precession\ndynamics during the inspiral are well approximated by our equivalent\nconfigurations. Our results suggest that in the comparable-mass regime waveform\nmodels with only three spin parameters faithfully represent generic waveforms,\nwhich has practical implications for the prospects of GW searches, parameter\nestimation and the numerical exploration of the precessing-binary parameter\nspace. \n\n"}

The metric of the deformed black hole is obtained by\nintegrating the Einstein field equations in a vacuum region of spacetime\nbounded by r < r_max, with r_max a maximum radius taken to be much smaller than\nthe distance to the remote matter. The tidal forces are assumed to be weak and\nto vary slowly in time, and the metric is expressed in terms of generic tidal\nquadrupole moments E_{ab} and B_{ab} that characterize the tidal environment.\nThe metric incorporates couplings between the black hole's spin vector and the\ntidal moments, and captures all effects associated with the dragging of\ninertial frames. In the second part of the article I determine the tidal\nmoments by immersing the black hole in a larger post-Newtonian system that\nincludes an external distribution of matter; while the black hole's internal\ngravity is allowed to be strong, the mutual gravity between the black hole and\nthe external matter is assumed to be weak. The post-Newtonian metric that\ndescribes the entire system is valid when r > r_min, where r_min is a minimum\ndistance that must be much larger than the black hole's radius. The black-hole\nand post-Newtonian metrics provide alternative descriptions of the same\ngravitational field in an overlap r_min < r < r_max, and matching the metrics\ndetermine the tidal moments, which are expressed as post-Newtonian expansions\ncarried out through one-and-a-half post-Newtonian order.

Anisotropy is known to affect the\nbulk properties of nonrotating neutron stars in General Relativity.

In the\nfirst case, it is shown that such orbits can lie as close to the horizon as one\nwishes on suitably chosen slices of space-time when $\\kappa \\rightarrow 0$.\nThis generalizes observation of T.\\ Jacobson Class. Quantum Grav. 28 187001\n(2011) made for the Kerr metric. If a black hole is extremal ($\\kappa =0$),\ncircular on-horizon orbits are impossible for massive particles but, in\ngeneral, are possible in its vicinity. The corresponding black hole parameters\ndetermine also the rate with which a fine-tuned particle on the noncircular\nnear-horizon orbit asymptotically approaches the horizon. Properties of orbits\nunder discussion are also related to the Ba% \\~nados-Silk-West effect of high\nenergy collisions near black holes.

Up to couplings of the object's multipole\nmoments to the external background curvature, these schemes have established\nthat at least through second order in perturbation theory, the object's motion\nsatisfies a generalized equivalence principle: it moves on a geodesic of a\ncertain smooth metric satisfying the vacuum Einstein equation. I describe the\nfoundations of this result, particularly focusing on the fundamental notion of\nhow a small object's motion is represented in perturbation theory. The three\ncommon representations of perturbed motion are (i) the \"Gralla-Wald\"\ndescription in terms of small deviations from a reference geodesic, (ii) the\n\"self-consistent\" description in terms of a worldline that obeys a\nself-accelerated equation of motion, and (iii) the \"osculating geodesics\"\ndescription, which utilizes both (i) and (ii).

One such set of relations determines all of the multipole moments of a\nneutron star just from the first three (the mass monopole, the current dipole\nand the mass quadrupole moment) approximately independently of the equation of\nstate.

An observer far from a star\nis most sensitive to the spherically-symmetric piece of this profile that\ndecays linearly with the inverse of the distance, the so-called scalar charge,\nwhich is related to the emission of dipolar radiation from compact binaries.\nThe presence of dipolar radiation has the potential to very strongly constrain\nextended theories of gravity. These facts may lead people to believe that\ngravitational theories with long-ranged scalar fields have already been\nconstrained strongly from binary pulsar observations. Here we challenge this\n\"lore\" by investigating the decoupling limit of Gauss-Bonnet gravity as an\nexample, in which the scalar field couples linearly to the Gauss-Bonnet density\nin the action. We prove a theorem that neutron stars in this theory cannot\npossess a scalar charge. Thus Gauss-Bonnet gravity evades the strong binary\npulsar constraints on dipole radiation. We discuss the astrophysical systems\nyielding the best constraints on Gauss-Bonnet gravity and related quadratic\ngravity theories. To achieve this we explicitly compute the scalar charge for\nslowly-rotating neutron stars in quadratic gravity theories. In generic case,\neither neutron star-binary or neutron star-black hole systems can be used to\nconstrain the theory, but Gauss-Bonnet gravity evades the neutron star-binary\nconstraints. However, black holes in Gauss-Bonnet gravity do anchor scalar\ncharge. The best constraints on Gauss-Bonnet gravity will thus come from black\nhole observations, for example via pulsar-black hole binaries.

A wide class\nof these theories, albeit indistinguishable from GR in the weak field regime,\npredicts a radically different phenomenology for neutron stars, due to a\nnonperturbative, strong-field effect referred to as spontaneous scalarization.\nThis effect is known to occur in theories where the effective linear coupling\n$\\beta_0$ between the scalar and matter fields is sufficiently negative, i.e.\n$\\beta_0 \\lesssim -4.35$, and has been strongly constrained by pulsar timing\nobservations.\n  In the test-field approximation, spontaneous scalarization manifests itself\nas a tachyonic-like instability. Recently, it was argued that, in theories\nwhere $\\beta_0>0$, a similar instability would be triggered by sufficiently\ncompact neutron stars obeying realistic equations of state. In this work we\ninvestigate the endstate of this instability for some representative coupling\nfunctions with $\\beta_0>0$.

If not accounted for, even a small orbital eccentricity can cause a\npotentially significant systematic error in the mass parameters of an\ninspiralling binary. Gravitational-wave search templates typically rely on the\nquasi-circular approximation, which provides relatively simple expressions for\nthe gravitational-wave phase to 3.5 post-Newtonian (PN) order. The\nquasi-Keplerian formalism provides an elegant but complex description of the\npost-Newtonian corrections to the orbits and waveforms of inspiralling binaries\nwith any eccentricity. Here we specialize the quasi-Keplerian formalism to\nbinaries with low eccentricity. In this limit the non-periodic contribution to\nthe gravitational-wave phasing can be expressed explicitly as simple functions\nof frequency or time, with little additional complexity beyond the well-known\nformulas for circular binaries.

First, applying Markov-chain Monte Carlo techniques, we use the absence\nof dipolar radiation in the pulsar-timing observations of five binary systems\ncomposed of a NS and a white dwarf, and eleven equations of state (EOSs) for\nNSs, to derive the most stringent constraints on the two free parameters of the\nDEF scalar-tensor theory.

Testing the no-hair theorem has\nbeen a longstanding goal of gravitational-wave astronomy. The recent detection\nof gravitational waves from black hole mergers would seem to make such tests\nimminent.

Abstract: The mass of the graviton, if nonzero, is usually considered to be very small,\ne.g. of the Hubble scale, from several observational constraints. In this\npaper, we propose a gravity model where the graviton mass is very small in the\nusual weak gravity environments, below all the current graviton mass bounds,\nbut becomes much larger in the strong gravity regime such as a black hole's\nvicinity. For black holes in this model, significant deviations from general\nrelativity emerge very close to the black hole horizon and alter the black hole\nquasi-normal modes, which can be extracted from the ringdown waveform of black\nhole binary mergers. Also, the enhancement of the graviton mass near the\nhorizon can result in echoes in the late time ringdown, which can be verified\nin the upcoming gravitational wave observations of higher sensitivity. \n\n"}

Using a combination of techniques, we carry out an\nextensive and systematic study of the hydrodynamical, thermodynamical, and\ngeometrical properties of the matter ejected dynamically, employing the WinNet\nnuclear-reaction network to recover the relative abundances of heavy elements\nproduced by each configurations. Among the results obtained, three are\nparticularly important. First, we find that both the properties of the\ndynamical ejecta and the nucleosynthesis yields are robust against variations\nof the EOS and masses, and match very well the observed chemical abundances.\nSecond, using a conservative but robust criterion for unbound matter, we find\nthat the amount of ejected mass is $\\lesssim 10^{-3}\\,M_{\\odot}$, hence at\nleast one order of magnitude smaller than what normally assumed in modelling\nkilonova signals.

The goal of this paper is to test these relations with extreme\nequations of state at supranuclear densities constrained to satisfy only a\nhandful of generic, physically sensible conditions. By requiring that the\nequation of state be (i) barotropic and (ii) its associated speed of sound be\nreal, we construct a piecewise function that matches a tabulated equation of\nstate at low densities, while matching a stiff equation of state parametrized\nby its sound speed in the high-density region.

To examine formation and\noscillation of rapidly rotating neutron stars (NS) after merger, we present an\nexploratory study of fully general-relativistic hydrodynamic simulations using\nthe public code Einstein Toolkit. The attention is focused on qualitative\naspects of long-term postmerger evolution. As simplified test models, we use a\nmoderately stiff Gamma=2 ideal-fluid equation of state and unmagnetized\nirrotational equal-mass binaries with three masses well below the threshold for\nprompt collapse. Our high resolution simulations generate postmerger \"ringdown\"\ngravitational wave (GW) signals of 170 ms, sustained by rotating massive NS\nremnants without collapsing to black holes. We observe that the high-density\ndouble-core structure inside the remnants gradually turns into a\nquasi-axisymmetric toroidal shape.

One such set of universal relations between the moment of inertia $(I)$,\nthe tidal Love number and the quadrupole moment $(Q)$ has been studied both in\nGeneral Relativity and in modified theories. In this paper, we study the\nrelations in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity, a well-motivated, parity-violating\neffective field theory, extending previous work in various ways. First, we\nstudy how projected constraints on the theory using the I-Love relation depend\non the measurement accuracy of $I$ with radio observations and that of the Love\nnumber with gravitational-wave observations. Provided these quantities can be\nmeasured with future observations, we find that the latter could place bounds\non dynamical Chern-Simons gravity that are six orders of magnitude stronger\nthan current bounds.

In this note,\nit is investigated the extent to which the framework can be generalized to the\ncase of non-Abelian gauge theories where `hairy black holes' are known to\nexist.

The emphasis is on the quantum geometry of the horizon.\nPolymer excitations of the bulk quantum geometry pierce the horizon endowing it\nwith area. The intrinsic geometry of the horizon is then described by the\nquantum Chern-Simons theory of a U(1) connection on a punctured 2-sphere, the\nhorizon. Subtle mathematical features of the quantum Chern-Simons theory turn\nout to be important for the existence of a coherent quantum theory of the\nhorizon geometry.

In this paper, I investigate the properties of a restricted\nfamily of such inspirals (the inspiral of circular, inclined orbits) with an\neye toward understanding observable properties of the gravitational waves that\nthey generate. Using results previously presented to calculate the effects of\nradiation reaction, I assemble the inspiral trajectories (assuming that\nradiation reacts adiabatically, so that over short timescales the trajectory is\napproximately geodesic) and calculate the wave generated as the compact body\nspirals in. I do this analysis for several black hole spins, sampling a range\nthat should be indicative of what spins we will encounter in nature. The spin\nhas a very strong impact on the waveform. In particular, when the hole rotates\nvery rapidly, tidal coupling between the inspiraling body and the event horizon\nhas a very strong influence on the inspiral time scale, which in turn has a big\nimpact on the gravitational wave phasing.

In each\nof the three cases the particle produces a field that behaves as outgoing\nradiation in the wave zone, and therefore removes energy from the particle. In\nthe near zone the field acts on the particle and gives rise to a self-force\nthat prevents the particle from moving on a geodesic of the background\nspacetime. The field's action on the particle is difficult to calculate because\nof its singular nature: the field diverges at the position of the particle. But\nit is possible to isolate the field's singular part and show that it exerts no\nforce on the particle -- its only effect is to contribute to the particle's\ninertia. What remains after subtraction is a smooth field that is fully\nresponsible for the self-force. Because this field satisfies a homogeneous wave\nequation, it can be thought of as a free (radiative) field that interacts with\nthe particle; it is this interaction that gives rise to the self-force. The\nmathematical tools required to derive the equations of motion of a point scalar\ncharge, a point electric charge, and a point mass in a specified background\nspacetime are developed here from scratch.

The orbits of the\ninspiraling COs are highly complicated; they can remain rather eccentric up\nuntil the final plunge, and display extreme versions of relativistic perihelion\nprecession and Lense-Thirring precession of the orbital plane. The strongest\ncapture signals will be ~10 times weaker than LISA's instrumental noise, but in\nprinciple (with sufficient computing power) they can be disentangled from the\nnoise by matched filtering. The associated template waveforms are not yet in\nhand, but theorists will very likely be able to provide them before LISA\nlaunches. Here we introduce a family of approximate (post-Newtonian) capture\nwaveforms, given in (nearly) analytic form, for use in advancing LISA studies\nuntil more accurate versions are available. Our model waveforms include most of\nthe key qualitative features of true waveforms, and cover the full space of\ncapture-event parameters (including orbital eccentricity and the MBH's spin).\nHere we use our approximate waveforms to (i) estimate the relative\ncontributions of different harmonics (of the orbital frequency) to the total\nsignal-to-noise ratio, and (ii) estimate the accuracy with which LISA will be\nable to extract the physical parameters of the capture event from the measured\nwaveform.

The specific matching procedure used here\nclosely follows the calculation in gr-qc/0503011, and is performed in the so\ncalled buffer zone where both the post-Newtonian and the perturbed\nSchwarzschild approximations hold. The result is that both metrics agree in the\nbuffer zone, up to the errors in the approximations. However, since isotropic\ncoordinates are very similar to ADMTT coordinates, matching yields better\nresults than in the previous calculation, where harmonic coordinates were used\nfor the post-Newtonian 4-metric.

Our emphasis here is more on the `bottom-up' approach, where one\nstarts with the semiclassical theory of gravity and examines how it is modified\nby graviton and quantum field excitations near and above the Planck scale. We\nmention three aspects based on our recent findings: 1) Emergence of stochastic\nbehavior of spacetime and matter fields depicted by an Einstein-Langevin\nequation. The backreaction of quantum fields on the classical background\nspacetime manifests as a fluctuation-dissipation relation. 2) Manifestation of\nstochastic behavior in effective theories below the threshold arising from\nexcitations above. The implication for general relativity is that such\nPlanckian effects, though exponentially suppressed, is in principle detectable\nat sub-Planckian energies. 3) Decoherence of correlation histories and quantum\nto classical transition.

These negative energy\ndensities lead to many problems. Although quantum field theory introduces\nnegative energies, it also provides constraints in the form of quantum\ninequalities (QI's). These uncertainty principle-type relations limit the\nmagnitude and duration of any negative energy. We derive a general form of the\nQI on the energy density for both the quantized scalar and electromagnetic\nfields in static curved spacetimes. In the case of the scalar field, the QI can\nbe written as the Euclidean wave operator acting on the Euclidean Green's\nfunction. Additionally, a small distance expansion on the Green's function is\nused to derive the QI in the short sampling time limit. It is found that the QI\nin this limit reduces to the flat space form with subdominant correction terms\nwhich depend on the spacetime geometry.\n  Several example spacetimes are studied in which exact forms of the QI's can\nbe found.

Such research is of direct\nrelevance to gravitational-wave sources for space-based detectors (such as\nLISA). We present here a study of the radiative evolution of circular (i.e.,\nconstant Boyer-Lindquist coordinate radius), non-equatorial Kerr black hole\norbits. Recent theorems have shown that, at least in an adiabatic evolution,\nsuch orbits evolve from one circular configuration into another, changing only\ntheir radius and inclination angle. This constrains the system's evolution in\nsuch a way that the change in its Carter constant can be deduced from knowledge\nof gravitational wave fluxes propagating to infinity and down the black hole's\nhorizon. Thus, in this particular case, a local radiation reaction force is not\nneeded. In accordance with post-Newtonian weak-field predictions, we find that\ninclined orbits radiatively evolve to larger inclination angles (although the\npost-Newtonian prediction overestimates the rate of this evolution in the\nstrong field by a factor $\\lesssim 3$).

Given a generic scalar potential we explicitly construct a\nmoduli metric that allows scaling solutions, and we show the converse - how one\ncan construct a potential that allows scaling once the moduli metric is known. \n\n"}

In this paper we compute the spectrum of tensor metric\nfluctuations (gravitational waves) in this scenario, and show that it is also\nnearly scale-invariant.

The bulk\ngravitational theory contains a conformally coupled scalar field with a Phi^4\npotential, and is holographically related to a massless scalar with a Phi^6\ninteraction in three dimensions. We consider the scalar sector of the bulk\ntheory and match bulk and boundary classical solutions of the equations of\nmotion. Of particular interest is the matching of the bulk and the boundary\ninstanton solutions which underlies the relationship between bulk and boundary\nvacua with broken conformal invariance. Using a form of radial quantization we\nshow that quantum states in the bulk correspond to multiply-occupied single\nparticle quantum states in the boundary theory. This allows us to explicitly\nidentify the boundary composite operator which is dual to the bulk scalar, at\nthe free theory level as well as in the instanton vacuum. We conclude with a\ndiscussion of possible implications of our results. \n\n"}
