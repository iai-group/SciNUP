Such\nparticles are expected to exist in many extensions of the Standard Model. In\nthis paper we explore the capability of the LHC to determine the $W'$ coupling\nhelicity at low integrated luminosities in the $\\ell +E_T^{miss}$ discovery\nchannel.

To make such measurements requires\nintegrated luminosities of $\\sim 10(60) fb^{-1}$ assuming $M_{W'}=1.5(2.5)$ TeV\nand provided that the $W'$ couplings have Standard Model magnitude. This\nhelicity determination can be further strengthened by the use of various\ndiscovery channel leptonic asymmetries, also measured in the same interference\nregime, but with higher integrated luminosities. \n\n"}

This work presents a\nperspective of progress in the field of control over quantum phenomena, tracing\nthe evolution of theoretical concepts and experimental methods from early\ndevelopments to the most recent advances. The current experimental successes\nwould be impossible without the development of intense femtosecond laser\nsources and pulse shapers. The two most critical theoretical insights were (1)\nrealizing that ultrafast atomic and molecular dynamics can be controlled via\nmanipulation of quantum interferences and (2) understanding that optimally\nshaped ultrafast laser pulses are the most effective means for producing the\ndesired quantum interference patterns in the controlled system. Finally, these\ntheoretical and experimental advances were brought together by the crucial\nconcept of adaptive feedback control, which is a laboratory procedure employing\nmeasurement-driven, closed-loop optimization to identify the best shapes of\nfemtosecond laser control pulses for steering quantum dynamics towards the\ndesired objective. Optimization in adaptive feedback control experiments is\nguided by a learning algorithm, with stochastic methods proving to be\nespecially effective. Adaptive feedback control of quantum phenomena has found\nnumerous applications in many areas of the physical and chemical sciences, and\nthis paper reviews the extensive experiments. Other subjects discussed include\nquantum optimal control theory, quantum control landscapes, the role of\ntheoretical control designs in experimental realizations, and real-time quantum\nfeedback control. The paper concludes with a prospective of open research\ndirections that are likely to attract significant attention in the future. \n\n"}

We assume that the effective E and B fields remain\northogonal during the quantum cycles. This mild restriction has many\nadvantages. It provides simple symmetries leading to selection rules and the\nHamiltonian-parameter and density-matrix spaces coincide for S=1. This implies\nthe identity of the Berry and Aharonov-Anandan phases, which is lost for S>1.\nWe have found that new features of Berry phases emerge for integer spins>2. We\nprovide explicit numerical results of Berry phases for S=2,3,4. We give a\nprecise analysis of the non-adiabatic corrections. The accuracy for satisfying\nadiabaticity is greatly improved if one chooses for the time derivatives of the\nparameters a time-dependence having a Blackman pulse shape. This has the effect\nof taming the non-adiabatic oscillation corrections which could be generated by\na linear ramping. For realistic experimental conditions, the non-adibatic\ncorrections can be kept < 0.1%. For quantum cycles,involving as sole periodic\nparameter the precession angle of E around B, the corrections odd upon the\nreversal of the angular velocity can be cancelled exactly if the quadrupole to\ndipole coupling ratio takes a \"magic\" value. The even ones are cancelled by\nsubtraction of the phases relative to opposite velocities.

The equations of motion of an ion in such a trap are\ngenerally coupled due to a nonzero relative angle $\\theta$ between the\nprincipal axes of RF and DC fields, invalidating the assumptions behind the\nstandard stability analysis for symmetric Paul traps. We obtain stability\ndiagrams for the coupled system for various values of $\\theta$, generalizing\nthe standard $q$-$a$ stability diagrams. We use multi-scale perturbation theory\nto obtain approximate formulas for the boundaries of the primary stability\nregion and obtain some of the stability boundaries independently by using the\nmethod of infinite determinants. We cross-check the consistency of the results\nof these methods. Our results show that while the primary stability region is\nquite robust to changes in $\\theta$, a secondary stability region is highly\nvariable, joining the primary stability region at the special case of\n$\\theta=45^{\\circ}$, which results in a significantly enlarged stability region\nfor this particular angle. We conclude that while the stability diagrams for\nclassical, symmetric Paul traps are not entirely accurate for asymmetric\nsurface traps (or for other types of traps with a relative angle between the RF\nand DC axes), they are safe in the sense that operating conditions deemed\nstable according to standard stability plots are in fact stable for asymmetric\ntraps, as well.

The measurement was based on the assumption that the pulse shape of the\nneutrinos from the decay of parent mesons produced in proton-target collisions\nis the same as that of the incident protons. Here we argue that the effective\ncolumn density of the target along the beam direction decreases with time\nduring the 10.5 microseconds duration of the proton pulse. This is because of\nthe thermal expansion and expulsion of target material along the beam by the\nenergy-momentum deposition during the 10.5 microseconds pulse. The progresive\nreduction in the effective column density during the pulse decreases the\nneutrino production rate per incident proton. It could have advanced the mean\nproduction time of the detected neutrinos relative to that calculated from the\nproton pulse-shape, by an amount comparable to the measured neutrino lead time\n(60.7+/-6.9(stat) +/-7.4(sys) ns.

In this paper we\npropose a novel type of dark matter detector: detectors made of DNA or RNA\ncould provide nanometer resolution for tracking, an energy threshold of 0.5\nkeV, and can operate at room temperature.

This interaction relies on strong coupling\nbetween the qubits' transition dipole moments and the vacuum fluctuations of\nthe resonator in the same manner as cavity QED, and has consequently come to be\ncalled \"circuit QED\" (cQED). Great strides in the control of quantum\ninformation have already been made experimentally using this idea. However, the\ncentral role played by photon exchange induced by quantum fluctuations in cQED\ndoes result in some characteristic limitations. In this paper, we discuss an\nalternative method for coupling qubits electromagnetically via a resonator, in\nwhich no photons are exchanged, and where the resonator need not have strong\nquantum fluctuations. Instead, the interaction can be viewed in terms of\nclassical, effective \"forces\" exerted by the qubits on the resonator, and the\nresulting resonator dynamics used to produce qubit entanglement are purely\nclassical in nature.

These\nprocesses require high-fidelity state preparation as well as minimizing the\ndecoherence that inevitably arises from coupling between the system and the\nenvironment and imperfect control of the system parameters. Here, on the\ncontrary, we combine unitary processes with engineered dissipation to\ndeterministically produce and stabilize an approximate Bell state of two\ntrapped-ion qubits independent of their initial state. While previous works\nalong this line involved the application of sequences of multiple\ntime-dependent gates [3] or generated entanglement of atomic ensembles\ndissipatively but relied on a measurement record for steady-state entanglement\n[4], we implement the process in a continuous time-independent fashion,\nanalogous to optical pumping of atomic states.

This\nquestion has been a subject of intense debate and controversy, ever since, in\n2008, it was claimed that such a gauge-invariant split was, in fact, possible.\nWe explain in what sense this claim is true and how it turns out that one of\nthe main problems is that such a decomposition is not unique and therefore\nraises the question of what is the most natural or physical choice.

The NCS is\nmodeled as a hybrid singularly perturbed system which exhibits the feature to\ngenerate jumps for both the fast variable and the error variable induced by the\nsampling. The first conclusion is that a triggering law which guarantees the\nstability and the existence of a uniform minimum amount of time between two\ntransmissions for the slow model may not ensure the existence of such a time\nfor the overall system, which makes the controller not implementable in\npractice.

Rydberg gases are made up of\nrandomly distributed, highly polarizable atoms that interact via strong dipolar\nforces. Dynamics in such a system is fundamentally different from cases in\nwhich the interactions are of short range, and is ultimately determined by the\nspectral and eigenvector structure. In the energy levels' spacing statistics,\nwe find evidence for a critical energy that separates delocalized eigenstates\nfrom states that are localized at pairs or clusters of atoms separated by less\nthan the typical nearest-neighbor distance. We argue that the dipole blockade\neffect in Rydberg gases can be leveraged to manipulate this transition across a\nwide range: As the blockade radius increases, the relative weight of localized\nstates is reduced. At the same time, the spectral statistics -- in particular,\nthe density of states and the nearest neighbor level spacing statistics --\nexhibits a transition from approximately a 1-stable L\\'evy to a Gaussian\northogonal ensemble. Deviations from random matrix statistics are shown to stem\nfrom correlations between interatomic interaction strengths that lead to an\nasymmetry of the spectral density and profoundly affect localization\nproperties.

This has implications for\ntools such as Optimal Power Flow (OPF), an optimization problem widely used in\npower system operations and planning, which should be adjusted to account for\nthis uncertainty. One way to handle the uncertainty is to formulate a Chance\nConstrained OPF (CC-OPF) which limits the probability of constraint violation\nto a predefined value. However, existing CC-OPF formulations and solutions are\nnot immune to drawbacks. On one hand, they only consider affine policies for\ngeneration control, which are not always realistic and may be sub-optimal. On\nthe other hand, the standard CC-OPF formulations do not distinguish between\nlarge and small violations, although those might carry significantly different\nrisk. In this paper, we introduce the Weighted CC-OPF (WCC-OPF) that can handle\ngeneral control policies while preserving convexity and allowing for efficient\ncomputation. The weighted chance constraints account for the size of violations\nthrough a weighting function, which assigns a higher risk to a higher\noverloads. We prove that the problem remains convex for any convex weighting\nfunction, and for very general generation control policies.

Lasserre and\nco-workers have shown that the real radical ideal of real polynomial systems\nwith finitely many real solutions can be determined by a combination of\nsemi-definite programming (SDP) and geometric involution techniques.

Therefore, the dark matter candidate\nis identified as the right-handed Majorana neutrino with odd $Z_2$ parity,\nkeeping the minimality of the particle content intact. When the dark matter\nparticle communicates with the SM particles mainly through the $B-L$ gauge\nboson ($Z^\\prime_{BL}$ boson), its relic abundance is determined by only three\nfree parameters, the $B-L$ gauge coupling ($\\alpha_{BL}$), the $Z^\\prime_{BL}$\nboson mass ($m_{Z^\\prime}$) and the dark matter mass ($m_{DM}$). With the\ncosmological upper bound on the dark matter relic abundance we find a lower\nbound on $\\alpha_{BL}$ as a function of $m_{Z^\\prime}$. On the other hand, we\ninterpret the recent LHC Run-2 results on search for $Z^\\prime$ boson resonance\nto an upper bound on $\\alpha_{BL}$ as a function of $m_{Z^\\prime}$. Combining\nthe two results we identify an allowed parameter region for this\n\"$Z^\\prime_{BL}$ portal\" dark matter scenario, which turns out to be a narrow\nwindow with the lower mass bound of $m_{Z^\\prime} > 2.5$ TeV. \n\n"}

While Markovian quantum network theory\neliminates quantum channels as structureless reservoirs in a Born-Markov\napproximation to obtain a master equation for the nodes, we are interested in\nnon-Markovian dynamics.

Examples of complex specifications of interest include\nproperties expressed as formulae in linear temporal logic (LTL) or as automata\non infinite strings. A general methodology to synthesize controllers for such\nproperties resorts to symbolic abstractions of the given stochastic systems.\nSymbolic models are discrete abstractions of the given concrete systems with\nthe property that a controller designed on the abstraction can be refined (or\nimplemented) into a controller on the original system. Although the recent\ndevelopment of techniques for the construction of symbolic models has been\nquite encouraging, the general goal of formal synthesis over stochastic control\nsystems is by no means solved. A fundamental issue with the existing techniques\nis the known \"curse of dimensionality,\" which is due to the need to discretize\nstate and input sets and that results in an exponential complexity over the\nnumber of state and input variables in the concrete system. In this work we\npropose a novel abstraction technique for incrementally stable stochastic\ncontrol systems, which does not require state-space discretization but only\ninput set discretization, and that can be potentially more efficient (and thus\nscalable) than existing approaches. We elucidate the effectiveness of the\nproposed approach by synthesizing a schedule for the coordination of two\ntraffic lights under some safety and fairness requirements for a road traffic\nmodel.

In\nexisting work, it is achieved by adding and subtracting variance decaying and\nzero-sum random noises to the consensus process. However, there is lack of\ntheoretical analysis to quantify the degree of the privacy protection. In this\npaper, we introduce the maximum disclosure probability that the other nodes can\ninfer one node's initial state within a given small interval to quantify the\nprivacy. We develop a novel privacy definition, named $(\\epsilon,\n\\delta)$-data-privacy, to depict the relationship between maximum disclosure\nprobability and estimation accuracy. Then, we prove that the general\nprivacy-preserving average consensus (GPAC) provides $(\\epsilon,\n\\delta)$-data-privacy, and provide the closed-form expression of the\nrelationship between $\\epsilon$ and $\\delta$. Meanwhile, it is shown that the\nadded noise with uniform distribution is optimal in terms of achieving the\nhighest $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-data-privacy.

Finally, an optimal privacy-preserving average consensus (OPAC)\nalgorithm is proposed to achieve the highest $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-data-privacy\nand avoid the privacy compromission.

As an added benefit, it greatly increases the\nachievable precision at nose points. The method is exemplified for the case of\nMvar limits in generators regulating voltage on both local and remote buses.\nBased on the framework of the Holomorphic Embedding Loadflow Method (HELM), it\nprovides a rigorous solution to this fundamental problem by framing it in terms\nof \\emph{optimization}. A novel Lagrangian formulation of power-flow, which is\nexact for lossless networks, leads to a natural physics-based minimization\ncriterion that yields the correct solution. For networks with small losses, as\nis the case in transmission, the AC power flow problem cannot be framed exactly\nin terms of optimization, but the criterion still retains its ability to select\nthe correct solution. This foundation then provides a way to design a HELM\nscheme to solve for the minimizing solution. Although the use of barrier\nfunctions evokes interior point optimization, this method, like HELM, is based\non the analytic continuation of a germ (of a particular branch) of the\nalgebraic curve representing the solutions of the system. In this case, since\nthe constraint equations given by limits result in an unavoidable singularity\nat $s=1$, direct analytic continuation by means of standard Pad\\'e\napproximation is fraught with numerical instabilities.

The least-absolute-value (LAV) estimator is known for\nits robustness relative to the weighted least-squares (WLS) one. However, due\nto nonconvexity and nonsmoothness, existing LAV solvers based on linear\nprogramming are typically slow, hence inadequate for real-time system\nmonitoring. This paper develops two novel algorithms for efficient LAV\nestimation, which draw from recent advances in composite optimization. The\nfirst is a deterministic linear proximal scheme that handles a sequence of\nconvex quadratic problems, each efficiently solvable either via off-the-shelf\nalgorithms or through the alternating direction method of multipliers.\nLeveraging the sparse connectivity inherent to power networks, the second\nscheme is stochastic, and updates only \\emph{a few} entries of the complex\nvoltage state vector per iteration. In particular, when voltage magnitude and\n(re)active power flow measurements are used only, this number reduces to one or\ntwo, \\emph{regardless of} the number of buses in the network. This\ncomputational complexity evidently scales well to large-size power systems.\nFurthermore, by carefully \\emph{mini-batching} the voltage and power flow\nmeasurements, accelerated implementation of the stochastic iterations becomes\npossible. The developed algorithms are numerically evaluated using a variety of\nbenchmark power networks. Simulated tests corroborate that improved robustness\ncan be attained at comparable or markedly reduced computation times for medium-\nor large-size networks relative to the \"workhorse\" WLS-based Gauss-Newton\niterations. \n\n"}

However, the essential two-qubit logic gate used for generating\nquantum entanglement has hitherto always been performed in an adiabatic regime,\nwhere the gate is slow compared with the characteristic motional frequencies of\nions in the trap, giving logic speeds of order 10kHz. There have been numerous\nproposals for performing gates faster than this natural \"speed limit\" of the\ntrap. We implement the method of Steane et al., which uses tailored laser\npulses: these are shaped on 10 ns timescales to drive the ions' motion along\ntrajectories designed such that the gate operation is insensitive to optical\nphase fluctuations. This permits fast (MHz-rate) quantum logic which is robust\nto this important source of experimental error. We demonstrate entanglement\ngeneration for gate times as short as 480ns; this is less than a single\noscillation period of an ion in the trap, and 8 orders of magnitude shorter\nthan the memory coherence time measured in similar calcium-43 hyperfine qubits.\nThe method's power is most evident at intermediate timescales, where it yields\na gate error more than ten times lower than conventional techniques; for\nexample, we achieve a 1.6 us gate with fidelity 99.8%. Still faster gates are\npossible at the price of higher laser intensity.

The temporal\nwaveguide modes are a natural basis for characterizing scattering in quantum\noptics, and afford a powerful technique based on a coarse discretization of\ntime. This overcomes limitations imposed by singularities in the\nwaveguide-system coupling.

We propose as regression method a\ntensor decomposition model that exploits the inherent three-way interaction of\npositions x velocities x accelerations.

Habitual control is computationally efficient but may be\ninflexible in changing environments. Conversely, deliberate planning may be\ncomputationally expensive, but flexible in dynamic environments.

Their realization,\nhowever, meets a major stumbling block -- the motion-induced dephasing of the\ntransition between the ground and Rydberg states. By using quantum interference\nbetween different detuned Rabi oscillations, we propose a practical scheme to\nrealize a class of accurate entangling Rydberg quantum gates subject to a\nminimal dephasing error. We show two types of such gates, $U_{1}$ and $U_{2}$,\nin the form of $\\text{diag}\\{1, e^{i\\alpha}, e^{i\\gamma}, e^{i\\beta}\\}$, where\n$\\alpha, \\gamma$, and $\\beta$ are determined by the parameters of lasers and\nthe Rydberg blockade $V$. $U_{1}$ is realized by sending to the two qubits a\nsingle off-resonant laser pulse, while $U_{2}$ is realized by individually\napplying one pulse of detuned laser to each qubit. Our method has several\nadvantages. First, the gates are accurate because the fidelity of $U_k$ is\nlimited only by a rotation error below $10^{-5}$ and the Rydberg-state decay.\nDecay error on the order of $10^{-5}$ can be easily obtained because all\ntransitions are detuned, resulting in small population in Rydberg state.\nSecond, the motion-induced dephasing is minimized because there is no gap time\nin which a population is left in the Rydberg shelving states of either qubit.\nThird, the gate is resilient to the variation of $V$. This is because among the\nthree phases $\\alpha,\\gamma$, and $\\beta$, only the last has a (partial)\ndependence on $V$. Fourth, the Rabi frequency and $V$ in our scheme are of\nsimilar magnitude, which permits a fast implementation of the gate when both of\nthem are of the feasible magnitude of several megahertz. The rapidity,\naccuracy, and feasibility of this interference method can lay the foundation\nfor entangling gates in universal quantum computing with neutral atoms. \n\n"}

Several full-state feedback controllers that ensure\nasymptotic regulation of the ball position have been reported in the\nliterature. However, to the best of our knowledge, the design of a stabilizing\nlaw measuring only the current and the voltage - so-called sensorless control -\nis conspicuous by its absence. Besides its unquestionable theoretical interest,\nthe high cost and poor reliability of position sensors for magnetic levitated\nsystems, makes the problem of great practical application. Our main\ncontribution is to provide the fist solution to this problem. Instrumental for\nthe development of the theory is the use of parameter estimation-based\nobservers, which combined with the dynamic regressor extension and mixing\nparameter estimation technique, allow the reconstruction of the magnetic flux.\nWith the knowledge of the latter it is shown that the mechanical coordinates\ncan be estimated with suitably tailored nonlinear observers.

The generated athermal\nspin states can also be exploited for quantum sensing and as probes for\nmany-body physics. Typical DNP methods require use of cryogens, large magnetic\nfields, and high power microwaves, which are expensive and unwieldy.\nNanodiamond particles, rich in Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centers, have attracted\nattention as alternative DNP agents because they can potentially be optically\nhyperpolarized at room temperature. Indeed the realization of a miniature\n\"optical nanodiamond hyperpolarizer\", where 13C nuclei are optically\nhyperpolarized has been a longstanding goal but has been technically\nchallenging to achieve. Here, unravelling new physics underlying an optical DNP\nmechanism first introduced in [Ajoy et al., Sci. Adv. 4, eaar5492 (2018)], we\nreport the realization of such a device in an ultracompact footprint and\nworking fully at room temperature. Instrumental requirements are very modest:\nlow polarizing fields, extremely low optical and microwave irradiation powers,\nand convenient frequency ranges that enable device miniaturization. We obtain\nbest reported optical 13C hyperpolarization in diamond particles exceeding 720\ntimes of the thermal 7T value (0.86% bulk polarization), corresponding to a\nten-million-fold gain in NMR averaging time. In addition the hyperpolarization\nsignal can be background-suppressed by over two-orders of magnitude and\nretained for multiple-minute long periods. Besides compelling applications in\nquantum sensing, and bright-contrast MRI imaging, this work paves the way for\nlow-cost DNP platforms that relay the 13C polarization to liquids in contact\nwith the high surface-area particles.

For effective\ncontrol, such an attacker's actions depend on its belief on the underlying\nstate of the system. We design a robust \"linear-plus-noise\" signaling strategy\nto encode sensor outputs in order to shape the attacker's belief in a strategic\nway and correspondingly to persuade the attacker to take actions that lead to\nminimum damage with respect to the system's objective. The specific model we\nadopt is a Gauss-Markov process driven by a controller with a (partially)\n\"unknown\" malicious/benign control objective.

In particular,\nangle-resolved intensity measurements reflect global statistics of atoms (total\nnumber of radiating atoms) as well as local statistical quantities (single-site\nstatistics even without an optical access to a single site) and pair\ncorrelations between different sites. As a striking example we consider\nscattering from transversally illuminated atoms into an optical cavity mode.\nFor the Mott insulator state, similar to classical diffraction, the number of\nphotons scattered into a cavity is zero due to destructive interference, while\nfor the superfluid state it is nonzero and proportional to the number of atoms.\nMoreover, we demonstrate that light scattering into a standing-wave cavity has\na nontrivial angle dependence, including the appearance of narrow features at\nangles, where classical diffraction predicts zero.
