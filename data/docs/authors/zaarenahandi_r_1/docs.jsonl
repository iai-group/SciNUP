We study this problem for $r$ points\nin the plane over an algebraically closed field $k$ of arbitrary characteristic\nin case either $r \\le 8$ or the points lie on a (possibly reducible) conic. In\neither case, it follows from work of the second author that there are only\nfinitely many configuration types of points, where our notion of configuration\ntype is a generalization of the notion of a representable combinatorial\ngeometry, also known as a representable simple matroid. (We say $p_1,...,p_r$\nand $p'_1,...,p'_r$ have the same {\\it configuration type} if for all choices\nof nonnegative integers $m_i$, $Z=m_1p_1+...+m_rp_r$ and\n$Z'=m_1p'_1+...+m_rp'_r$ have the same Hilbert function.)

In this paper we introduce a weaker type of\ndecomposition, which we call Hilbert decomposition, since it only depends on\nthe Hilbert function of $M$, and an analogous notion of depth, called Hilbert\ndepth. Since Stanley decompositions are Hilbert decompositions, the latter set\nupper bounds to the existence of Stanley decompositions. The advantage of\nHilbert decompositions is that they are easier to find. We test our new notion\non the syzygy modules of the residue class field of $K[X_1,...,X_n]$ (as usual\nidentified with $K$).

Inspired by work in quantum\ninformation theory, we develop a general mathematical toolbox for this type of\nquestion. The convertibility of resources into other ones and the possibility\nof combining resources is accurately captured by the mathematics of ordered\ncommutative monoids.

In this article we focus on\ndeformations of toric rings, and give an explicit description of $T^1(R)$ in\nthe case that $R$ is a toric ring.\n  In particular, we are interested in unobstructed deformations which preserve\nthe toric structure.

The paper consists of the following themes,\nincluding many other topics. We prove that if every parameter ideal of a\nNoetherian local ring of prime characteristic $p>0$ is Frobenius closed, then\nit is $F$-injective. We prove a necessary and sufficient condition for the\ninjectivity of the Frobenius action on $H^i_{\\fm}(R)$ for all $i \\le\nf_{\\fm}(R)$, where $f_{\\fm}(R)$ is the finiteness dimension of $R$. As\napplications, we prove the following results. (a) If the ring is $F$-injective,\nthen every ideal generated by a filter regular sequence, whose length is equal\nto the finiteness dimension of the ring, is Frobenius closed. It is a\ngeneralization of a recent result of Ma and which is stated for generalized\nCohen-Macaulay local rings. (b) Let $(R,\\fm,k)$ be a generalized Cohen-Macaulay\nring of characteristic $p>0$. If the Frobenius action is injective on the local\ncohomology $H_{\\fm}^i(R)$ for all $i < \\dim R$, then $R$ is Buchsbaum. This\ngives an answer to a question of Takagi.

There is an expected\nnumber of conditions imposed by this fat point, and we study those $Z$ for\nwhich this expected value is not achieved.

The standard question (along the lines of Singularity Theory) is\nthe finite-(\\Sigma,G)-determinacy of matrices.\n  In our previous work this determinacy question was reduced to the study of\nthe tangent spaces to \\Sigma and to the orbit, T_{(\\Sigma,A)}, T_{(GA,A)}, and\ntheir quotient: the tangent module to the miniversal deformation. In\nparticular, the order of determinacy is controlled by the annihilator of this\ntangent module.\n  Then we have studied this tangent module for the group action GL(m,R)\\times\nGL(n,R) on Mat(m,n;R) and for various natural subgroups of it. These are\nR-linear group actions.\n  In the current work we study this tangent module for group actions that\ninvolve the automorphisms of the ring, or, geometrically, group-actions that\ninvolve the local coordinate changes. (These actions are not R-linear.) We\nobtain various bounds on the support of this module. This gives ready-to-use\ncriteria of determinacy for matrices, (embedded) modules and (skew-)symmetric\nforms. \n\n"}

We show that these moves are in fact equivalent to a linear\nquotient ordering on $I_{\\overline{G}}$, the edge ideal of the complement\ngraph. Known results imply that $I_{\\overline G}$ has linear quotients if and\nonly if $G$ is chordal, and hence this recovers an algebraic proof of their\ncharacterization.

From this, together with the combinatorics of the pipe dreams of\n[Fomin--Kirillov 1996], we derive a new formula for the numerators of their\nmultigraded Hilbert series, the double Grothendieck polynomials, in terms of\n\"flagged set-valued tableaux\".
