The nonresonant contributions arising from $B\\to\nP_1P_2$ transitions are evaluated using heavy meson chiral perturbation theory\n(HMChPT). The momentum dependence of nonresonant amplitudes is assumed to be in\nthe exponential form $e^{-\\alpha_{NR}} p_B\\cdot(p_i+p_j)}$ so that the HMChPT\nresults are recovered in the soft meson limit $p_i, p_j\\to 0$. In addition, we\nhave identified another large source of the nonresonant signal in the matrix\nelements of scalar densities, e.g. $<K\\bar K|\\bar ss|0>$, which can be\nconstrained from the decay $\\bar B^0\\to K_SK_SK_S$ or $B^-\\to K^-K_SK_S$. The\nintermediate vector meson contributions to 3-body decays are identified through\nthe vector current, while the scalar meson resonances are mainly associated\nwith the scalar density. Their effects are described in terms of the\nBreit-Wigner formalism. Our main results are: (i) All KKK modes are dominated\nby the nonresonant background. The predicted branching ratios of\n$K^+K^-K_{S(L)}$, $K^+K^-K^-$ and $K^-K_SK_S$ modes are consistent with the\ndata within errors. (ii) Although the penguin-dominated $B^0\\to K^+K^-K_{S}$\ndecay is subject to a potentially significant tree pollution, its effective\n$\\sin 2\\beta$ is very similar to that of the $K_SK_SK_S$ mode. However, direct\nCP asymmetry of the former, being of order -4%, is more prominent than the\nlatter.

I consider here the implications of the\nheavier composition on the sources of UHECRs. The smaller magnetic rigidity\nimplies that nuclei UHECRs are: (i) More easily accelerated (ii) Local, as they\ncan diffuse only a few Mpc from their sources before disintegrating (iii)\nIsotropic, because large deflections in the extra galactic and the galactic\nmagnetic fields erase the directional information. Uncertainties in the\nstrength and structure of the the extra galactic magnetic field (EGMF) makes it\ndifficult to estimate the overall effects. However, with typical reasonable\nparameters of a few nG and a coherence distance of a Mpc the distance a nuclei\nUHECR above the GZK energy traverses before photodisintegrating is only a few\nMpc. In spite of the significantly weaker limits on the luminosity, Cen A is\nthe only currently active potential source of nuclei UHECRs within this\ndistance.

Methods: We calculate the neutrino flux from $\\beta$\nprocesses using nuclear statistical equilibrium abundances convoluted with\napproximate neutrino spectra of the individual nuclei and the thermal neutrino\nspectrum (pair+plasma). Results: Although the two considered thermonuclear\nsupernova explosion scenarios are expected to produce almost identical\nelectromagnetic output, their neutrino signatures appear vastly different,\nwhich allow an unambiguous identification of the explosion mechanism: a pure\ndeflagration produces a single peak in the neutrino light curve, while the\naddition of the second maximum characterizes a delayed-detonation. We\nidentified the following main contributors to the neutrino signal: (1) weak\nelectron neutrino emission from electron captures (in particular on the protons\nCo55 and Ni56) and numerous beta-active nuclei produced by the thermonuclear\nflame and/or detonation front, (2) electron antineutrinos from positron\ncaptures on neutrons, and (3) the thermal emission from pair annihilation.

The atmospheric neutrino\nflux above 1 PeV should be supposedly dominated by the contribution of charmed\nparticle decays. These (prompt) neutrinos originated from decays of massive and\nshortlived particles, $D^\\pm$, $D^0$, $\\bar{D}{}^0$, $D_s^\\pm$, $\\Lambda^+_c$,\nform the most uncertain fraction of the high-energy atmospheric neutrino flux\nbecause of poor explored processes of the charm production. Besides, an\nambiguity in high-energy behavior of pion and especially kaon production cross\nsections for nucleon-nucleus collisions may affect essentially the calculated\nneutrino flux. There is the energy region where above flux uncertainties\nsuperimpose. A new calculation presented here reveals sizable differences, up\nto the factor of 1.8 above 1 TeV, in muon neutrino flux predictions obtained\nwith usage of known hadronic models, SIBYLL 2.1 and QGSJET-II. The atmospheric\nneutrino flux in the energy range $10-10^7$ GeV was computed within the 1D\napproach to solve nuclear cascade equations in the atmosphere, which takes into\naccount non-scaling behavior of the inclusive cross-sections for the particle\nproduction, the rise of total inelastic hadron-nucleus cross-sections and\nnonpower-law character of the primary cosmic ray spectrum. This approach was\nrecently tested in the atmospheric muon flux calculations [1].

These resonances\nare usually believed to have multi-TeV mass due to electroweak precision\nconstraints, placing them on the edge of LHC discovery reach. Searching for\nthem is made particularly challenging because hadronically decaying electroweak\nbosons produced at such high energy will appear very similar to QCD jets. In\nthis work we revisit the possibility of discovering these resonances at the\nLHC, taking advantage of recently developed jet substructure techniques. We\nmake a systematic investigation of substructure performance for the\nidentification of highly Lorentz-boosted electroweak bosons, which should also\nbe applicable to more general new physics searches.

Two consequences of these models are: (i) a new kind of\nR-parity breaking interaction that protects proton stability but adds new\ncontributions to neutrinoless double beta decay and (ii) an upper bound on the\nextra gauge and parity symmetry breaking scale which is within the large hadron\ncollider (LHC) energy range.

Here, I examine the prospects for reconstructing the\nlocal speed distribution of WIMPs in addition to WIMP particle-physics\nproperties (mass, cross sections) from next-generation cryogenic and\nliquid-noble direct-detection experiments. I find that the common method of\nfixing the form of the velocity distribution when estimating constraints on\nWIMP mass and cross sections means losing out on the information on the speed\ndistribution contained in the data and may lead to biases in the inferred\nvalues of the particle-physics parameters.

Moreover, one can use Bayesian model-selection criteria to\ndetermine if a theoretically-inspired functional form for the speed\ndistribution (such as a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution) fits better than an\nempirical model. The shape of the degeneracy between WIMP mass and cross\nsections and their offset from the true values of those parameters depends on\nthe hypothesis for the speed distribution, which has significant implications\nfor consistency checks between direct-detection and collider data.

We then assign\nstellar mass profile and velocity dispersion profile parameters to each system\nin the SEC using their observed correlations with M_star and sigma.\nSimultaneously, we solve for dark matter density profile of each halo using the\nspherical Jeans equation. The resulting dark matter density profiles deviate in\ngeneral from the dissipationless profile of NFW or Einasto and their mean inner\ndensity slope and concentration vary systematically with M_vir. Statistical\ntests of the distribution of profiles at fixed M_vir rule out the null\nhypothesis that it follows the distribution predicted by N-body simulations for\nM_vir ~< 10^{13.5-14.5} M_solar. These dark matter profiles imply that dark\nmatter density is, on average, enhanced significantly in the inner region of\nhalos with M_vir ~< 10^{13.5-14.5} M_solar supporting halo contraction.

A non-zero\nparameter delta_{RR}^{13} can open the decay channel K -> e nu_tau and enhance\nR_K over its Standard-Model value.

For\nlarge values of the stau mixing angle theta_tau the commonly adopted mass\ninsertion approximation is not accurate.

The physics\nprogramme is devoted to an exploration of the energy frontier, complementing\nthe LHC and its discovery potential for physics beyond the Standard Model with\nhigh precision deep inelastic scattering measurements. These are designed to\ninvestigate a variety of fundamental questions in strong and electroweak\ninteractions. The physics programme also includes electron-deuteron and\nelectron-ion scattering in a $(Q^2, 1/x)$ range extended by four orders of\nmagnitude as compared to previous lepton-nucleus DIS experiments for novel\ninvestigations of neutron's and nuclear structure, the initial conditions of\nQuark-Gluon Plasma formation and further quantum chromodynamic phenomena. The\nLHeC may be realised either as a ring-ring or as a linac-ring collider. Optics\nand beam dynamics studies are presented for both versions, along with technical\ndesign considerations on the interaction region, magnets and further\ncomponents, together with a design study for a high acceptance detector. Civil\nengineering and installation studies are presented for the accelerator and the\ndetector. The LHeC can be built within a decade and thus be operated while the\nLHC runs in its high-luminosity phase. It thus represents a major opportunity\nfor progress in particle physics exploiting the investment made in the LHC. \n\n"}

For instance, the identification of such a state with the\nlightest CP-even Higgs boson of the MSSM ($h^0$), requires large values of\n$\\tan\\beta$ and/or heavy sfermions. One outcome of this result is the\npossibility to solve the SUSY flavor and CP problems by decoupling, which\npoints towards some realization of Split-inspired SUSY scenarios, in which\nscalars are much heavier than gauginos and higgsinos. However, we argue here\nthat the remaining Higgs bosons of the MSSM ($H^0$, $A^0$, $H^{\\pm}$) do not\nhave to be as heavy as the sfermions, and having them with masses near the EW\nscale does not pose any conflict with current MSSM constraints.

The combined data set\nconsidered in this report corresponds to a total luminosity of about 3\nfb$^{-1}$ collected by the four LEP experiments ALEPH, DELPHI, L3 and OPAL, at\ncentre-of-mass energies ranging from 130 GeV to 209 GeV.\n  Combining the published results of the four LEP experiments, the measurements\ninclude total and differential cross-sections in photon-pair, fermion-pair and\nfour-fermion production, the latter resulting from both double-resonant WW and\nZZ production as well as singly resonant production. Total and differential\ncross-sections are measured precisely, providing a stringent test of the\nStandard Model at centre-of-mass energies never explored before in\nelectron-positron collisions.

In particular, we have made\nexplicit comparisons between the fitting results BEFORE and AFTER the Moriond\n2013 meetings. Highlights of the results include: (i) the nonstandard decay\nbranching ratio of the Higgs boson is less than 22%; (ii) the most efficient\nway to achieve the best fit for the data before the Moriond update is to\nintroduce additional particle contributions to the triangular-loop functions of\nH\\gamma\\gamma and Hgg vertices; (iii) the 1\\sigma allowed range of the relative\ncoupling of HVV is 1.01 +0.13 -0.14, which means that the electroweak-symmetry\nbreaking contribution from the observed Higgs boson leaves only a small room\nfor other Higgs bosons; (iv) the current data do not rule out pseudoscalar\ncouplings nor pseudoscalar contributions to the H\\gamma\\gamma and Hgg vertices;\nand (v) the SM Higgs boson provides the best fit to all the current Higgs data. \n\n"}

Given that\nleptons remain in the thermal bath until late times, we focus on their\ninteractions with DM. To illustrate the method, we use the null results of LEP\nmissing energy searches along with Fermi-LAT searches for DM annihilation in\nnearby dwarf galaxies, to derive limits on the protohalo mass, $\\lesssim\n(10^{-6}-10^{-1}) M_{\\odot}$, with the range depending on the DM mass and the\noperator.

In a large region\nof the parameter space, the NLSPs travel macroscopic distances, of the order\n0.1-1000 mm, before they decay.

If such a prediction is possible, we\ncorrespondingly propose a prediction in this study that the thermal radiation\nappears in the inertial frame from an electron heated by the Unruh effect in\nthe accelerating frame. The point in our prediction is, although the Unruh\neffect is only in the accelerating frame, if the appearance of the Brownian\nmotion rooted in the Unruh effect in the inertial frame can be predicted, the\nheat that the particle gets in its body by the Unruh effect in the accelerating\nframe could survive in the inertial frame. Based on such a prediction, in this\npaper we investigate phenomena in the neighborhood of an accelerating electron\nin the inertial frame. The model we consider is the four-dimensional\nKlein-Gordon real scalar field model with the Higgs type potential term at the\nfinite temperature identified with the Unruh temperature on the de Sitter\nspace-time. We calculate the one-loop effective potential in the inertial frame\nwith the corrections by the thermal radiation rooted in the Unruh effect in the\naccelerating frame.

Then, a\nmultichannel direction-sensitive sapphire detector stack is described. It\ncomprises 8 sapphire plates of 1 cm^2 size and 525 micro m thickness,\nmetallized on both sides, and apposed to form a stack. Each second metal layer\nis supplied with a bias voltage, and the layers in between are connected to\ncharge-sensitive preamplifiers. The performance of the detector was studied in\na 5 GeV electron beam. The charge collection efficiency measured as a function\nof the bias voltage rises with the voltage, reaching about 10 % at 950 V. The\nsignal size obtained from electrons crossing the stack at this voltage is about\n22000 e, where e is the unit charge.\n  The signal size is measured as a function of the hit position, showing\nvariations of up to 20 % in the direction perpendicular to the beam and to the\nelectric field. The measurement of the signal size as a function of the\ncoordinate parallel to the electric field confirms the prediction that mainly\nelectrons contribute to the signal. Also evidence for the presence of a\npolarisation field was observed. \n\n"}

We provide a possible explanation of the excess as the isospin-triplet\ntechnivector mesons (technirhos, denoted as $\\rho_\\Pi^{\\pm,3}$) of the walking\ntechnicolor in the case of the one-family model as a benchmark. As the\neffective theory for the walking technicolor at the scales relevant to the LHC\nexperiment, we take a scale-invariant version of the hidden local symmetry\nmodel so constructed as to accommodate technipions, technivector mesons, and\nthe technidilaton in such a way that the model respects spontaneously broken\nchiral and scale symmetries of the underlying walking technicolor.

Currently available\nLHC limits on those technihadrons are used to fix the couplings of technivector\nmesons to the standard-model fermions and weak gauge bosons.

With that in mind, we present an\nempirical study on the energy dependence of the ratio $X$ between the elastic\nand total cross sections; a quantity related to the evolution of the hadronic\ncentral opacity.

Generalizing previous works, we discuss four\nmodel-independent analytical parameterizations for $X$, consisting of sigmoid\nfunctions composed with elementary functions of the energy and three distinct\nasymptotic scenarios: either the standard black disk limit or scenarios above\nor below that limit. Our two main conclusions are the following: (1) although\nconsistent with the experimental data, the black disk does not represent an\nunique solution; (2) the data reductions favor a semi-transparent scenario,\nwith asymptotic average value for the ratio $\\bar{X}$ = 0.30 $\\pm$ 0.12.

Abstract: In many analyses in high energy physics, attempts are made to remove the\neffects of detector smearing in data by techniques referred to as \"unfolding\"\nhistograms, thus obtaining estimates of the true values of histogram bin\ncontents. Such unfolded histograms are then compared to theoretical\npredictions, either to judge the goodness of fit of a theory, or to compare the\nabilities of two or more theories to describe the data. When doing this, even\ninformally, one is testing hypotheses. However, a more fundamentally sound way\nto test hypotheses is to smear the theoretical predictions by simulating\ndetector response and then comparing to the data without unfolding; this is\nalso frequently done in high energy physics, particularly in searches for new\nphysics. One can thus ask: to what extent does hypothesis testing after\nunfolding data materially reproduce the results obtained from testing by\nsmearing theoretical predictions? We argue that this \"bottom-line-test\" of\nunfolding methods should be studied more commonly, in addition to common\npractices of examining variance and bias of estimates of the true contents of\nhistogram bins.

{"id": "1612.06180", "contents": "Title: Observation of superradiance in a vortex flow Abstract: Wave scattering phenomena are ubiquitous to almost all Sciences, from Biology\nto Physics. When an incident wave scatters off of an obstacle, it is partially\nreflected and partially transmitted. Since the scatterer absorbs part of the\nincident energy, the reflected wave carries less energy than the incident one.\nHowever, if the obstacle is rotating, this process can be reversed and waves\ncan be amplified, extracting energy from the scatterer. Even though this\nphenomenon, known as superradiance, has been thoroughly analysed in several\ntheoretical scenarios (from eletromagnetic radiation scattering on a rotating\ncylinder to gravitational waves incident upon a rotating black hole), it has\nnever been observed. Here we describe in detail the first laboratory detection\nof superradiance. We observed that plane waves propagating on the surface of\nwater are amplified after being scattered by a draining vortex. The maximum\namplification measured in the experiment was 20%, obtained for 3.70 Hz waves,\nin a 6.25 cm deep fluid. Our results are consistent with superradiant\nscattering caused by rapid rotation. In particular, a draining fluid can\ntransfer part of its rotational energy to incident low-frequency waves. Our\nexperimental findings will shed new light on Black Hole Physics, since shallow\nwater waves scattering on a draining fluid constitute an analogue of a black\nhole. We believe, especially in view of the recent observations of\ngravitational waves, that our results will motivate further research (both\ntheoretical and experimental) on the observation of superradiance of\ngravitational waves. \n\n"}

This requires to give a precise and gauge-invariant meaning to\nthe underlying physics. This is complicated by the fact that concepts like the\nHiggs vacuum expectation value or the separation between confinement and the\nBEH effect loose their meaning beyond perturbation theory. This is addressed by\ncarefully constructing the corresponding theory space and the quantum phase\ndiagram. The physical spectrum needs then to be also given in terms of\ngauge-invariant, i. e. composite, states. Using gauge-invariant perturbation\ntheory, as developed by Froehlich, Morchio, and Strocchi, it is possible to\nrederive conventional perturbation theory. This derivation explicitly shows why\nthe description of the standard model in terms of the unphysical,\ngauge-dependent, elementary states of the Higgs and W-bosons and Z-boson, but\nalso of the elementary fermions, is adequate and successful. These are\nunavoidable consequences of the field theory underlying the standard model,\nfrom which the usual picture emerges. The validity of this emergence can only\nbe tested non-perturbatively.

Scenario 1): These\nimpurities include the isotope 37Ar, which decays by electron capture, emitting\na 2.8 keV x-ray. These decays appear as single-site, monoenergetic events in\nDAMA/LIBRA, and produce an annual modulation due to the variation of neutron\nflux in the atmosphere and at the Earth's surface, which in turn leads to a\nseasonal variation in 37Ar production from the reactions\n$^{40}\\textrm{Ca}(\\textrm{n,}\\alpha)^{37}\\textrm{Ar}$ and\n$^{36}\\textrm{Ar}(\\textrm{n,}\\gamma)^{37}\\textrm{Ar}$.

Our main objective is\ninterpretation of radio wave signals produced by cosmic ray interactions with\nEarth's atmosphere which are observed by the Antarctica based ANITA detector\nafter reflection off the ice surface. The incident wave is decomposed into\nplane waves and each plane wave is reflected off the surface using the standard\nFresnel formalism. For each plane wave the reflected wave is assumed to be\nlocally a plane wave. This is a very reasonable assumption and there are no\nuncontrolled approximations in our treatment of the reflection phenomenon. The\nsurface roughness effects are also included by using a simple model. We apply\nour formalism to the radiation produced by the balloon-borne HiCal\nradio-frequency (RF) transmitter.

A well motivated candidate is the flavon in a flavor theory which\nexplains the smallness of the fermion masses by the large volume of the extra\ndimensions. The flavon interactions involve the Higgs field and can therefore\ngive rise to new mechanisms of Higgs boson production. We study these new Higgs\nsignals, including both real flavon emission and virtual flavon exchange. They\ncould provide powerful probes of the string scale which are comparable to the\nextensively studied graviton production, if the flavons and the graviton feel\nthe same number of extra dimensions. If the flavons only live in a subspace of\nthe extra dimensions, they can yield even stronger bounds and may generate\nspectacular displaced vertex signals. Our study also applies to a four\ndimensional flavor theory with light flavons as well as to any theory with bulk\nscalar fields coupled to the Higgs and fermions. \n\n"}
