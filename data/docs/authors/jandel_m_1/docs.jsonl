Although the stability of the operator product expansion side seems\nto break down at T > 1.06Tc for the vector channel and T>1.04Tc for the\npseudoscalar channel, we find a sudden change of the spectral property across\nthe critical temperature Tc, which originates from an equally rapid change of\nthe scalar gluon condensate characterized by e-3p.

I demonstrate that\nunder quite natural assumptions about the dynamics of heavy ion collisions this\nleads to a universal (i.e. independent of the initial parton energy, but\ndependent on flavor and centrality) upper bound on the energy of the partons\nescaping from the plasma. This bound is a Yang--Mills analog of the Pomeranchuk\nbound in classical electrodynamics, where it is a consequence of radiation in a\nstrong external field acting on a relativistic charge.

This hybrid approach is based on the Ultra-relativistic\nQuantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD) transport approach with an intermediate\nhydrodynamical evolution for the hot and dense stage of the collision.\nEvent-by-event fluctuations are directly taken into account via the\nnon-equilibrium initial conditions generated by the initial collisions and\nstring fragmentations in the microscopic UrQMD model. After a (3+1)-dimensional\nideal hydrodynamic evolution, the hydrodynamical fields are mapped to hadrons\nvia the Cooper-Frye equation and the subsequent hadronic cascade calculation\nwithin UrQMD proceeds to incorporate the important final state effects for a\nrealistic freeze-out. This implementation allows to compare pure microscopic\ntransport calculations with hydrodynamic calculations using exactly the same\ninitial conditions and freeze-out procedure. The effects of the change in the\nunderlying dynamics - ideal fluid dynamics vs. non-equilibrium transport theory\n- will be explored. The freeze-out and initial state parameter dependences are\ninvestigated for different observables. Furthermore, the time evolution of the\nbaryon density and particle yields are discussed. We find that the final pion\nand proton multiplicities are lower in the hybrid model calculation due to the\nisentropic hydrodynamic expansion while the yields for strange particles are\nenhanced due to the local equilibrium in the hydrodynamic evolution.

New experimental data on nucleon spin\nstructure at low to intermediate momentum transfers combined with existing high\nmomentum transfer data offer a comprehensive picture in the strong region of\nthe interaction and of the transition region from the strong to the\nasymptotic-free region. Insight for some aspects of the theory for the strong\ninteraction, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), is gained by exploring lower moments\nof spin structure functions and their corresponding sum rules. These moments\nare expressed in terms of an operator-product expansion using quark and gluon\ndegrees of freedom at moderately large momentum transfers. The higher-twist\ncontributions have been examined through the evolution of these moments as the\nmomentum transfer varies from higher to lower values. Furthermore, QCD-inspired\nlow-energy effective theories, which explicitly include chiral symmetry\nbreaking, are tested at low momentum transfers.

The bulk contribution to NST arises\nfrom an extended sharp radius of neutrons, whereas the surface contribution\narises from different widths of the neutron and proton surfaces. Nuclear models\nwhere the symmetry energy is stiff, as typical relativistic models, predict a\nbulk contribution in NST of 208Pb about twice as large as the surface\ncontribution. In contrast, models with a soft symmetry energy like common\nnonrelativistic models predict that NST of 208Pb is divided similarly into bulk\nand surface parts.

Second, tensor-polarized quark and antiquark distributions are\nobtained by analyzing HERMES measurements on the structure function b_1 for the\ndeuteron.

In\ncontrasting this behaviour with that produced by a momentum-dependent\ninteraction, one achieves comparisons which highlight that elastic scattering\nand resonance electroproduction experiments probe the infrared evolution of\nQCD's running masses; e.g., the existence, and location if so, of a zero in the\nratio of nucleon Sachs form factors are strongly influenced by the running of\nthe dressed-quark mass. In our description of baryons, diquark correlations are\nimportant. These correlations are instrumental in producing a zero in the Dirac\nform factor of the proton's d-quark; and in determining d_v/u_v(x=1), as we\nshow via a formula that expresses d_v/u_v(x=1) in terms of the nucleon's\ndiquark content. The contact interaction produces a first excitation of the\nnucleon that is constituted predominantly from axial-vector diquark\ncorrelations.

Modification of\nheavy-flavor production in heavy-ion collisions relative to binary-collision\nscaling from p+p results, quantified with the nuclear-modification factor\n(R_AA), provides information on both cold- and hot-nuclear-matter effects.\n  Purpose: Determine transverse-momentum, pt, spectra and the corresponding\nR_AA for muons from heavy-flavor mesons decay in p+p and Cu+Cu collisions at\nsqrt(s_NN)=200 GeV and y=1.65.\n  Method: Results are obtained using the semi-leptonic decay of heavy-flavor\nmesons into negative muons.

However, the SM fails to explain the non-visible but\ngravitationally active part of the universe.

This correlation may indicate the larger modification of nucleons with\nhigher momentum thus making the nucleon virtuality as the most relevant\nparameter of medium modifications. To check this conjecture we study the\nimplication of several properties of high momentum component of the nuclear\nwave function on the characteristics of EMC effect. We observe two main reasons\nfor the EMC-SRC correlation: first, the decrease of the contribution from the\nnuclear mean field due to the increase, with A, the fraction of the high\nmomentum component of nuclear wave function. Second, the increase of the medium\nmodification of nucleons in SRC. Our main prediction however is the increase of\nthe proton contribution to the EMC effect for large A asymmetric nuclei. This\nprediction is based on the recent observation of the strong dominance of pn\nSRCs in the high momentum component of nuclear wave function. Our preliminary\ncalculation based on this prediction of the excess of energetic and modified\nprotons in large A nuclei describes reasonably well the main features of the\nobserved EMC-SRC correlation. \n\n"}

The geometric correlations (i) are due to the fact\nthat nucleons are correlated by simply being confined within the same nucleus\nand may lead to long-range rapidity correlations for the produced particles\nwithout strong azimuthal angle dependence.

Predictions of 146Sm and 144Sm\nproduction in the gamma-process in massive stars are at odds with these\nconstraints and this is partly due to deficiences in the prediction of the\nreaction rates involved.

The transverse-momentum\nrange 0.7 $ < p_{\\rm{T}, assoc} < p_{\\rm{T}, trig} <$ 5.0 GeV/$c$ is examined,\nto include correlations induced by jets originating from low\nmomen\\-tum-transfer scatterings (minijets).

The near-side long-range pseudorapidity correlations observed in\nhigh-multiplicity p-Pb collisions are subtracted from both near-side\nshort-range and away-side correlations in order to remove the non-jet-like\ncomponents.

We consider a very transparent example of an\nideal pion gas with quantum statistics, which can be viewed as a\nmulti-component gas of Boltzmann particles with different charges and masses.\nCumulants of net-electric charge fluctuations $\\chi_n^Q$ are calculated in a\nstatic and expanding medium with flow parameters adjusted to the experimental\ndata. We show that the transverse momentum cut, $p_{t_\\text{min}}\\leq p_t\\leq\np_{t_\\text{max}}$, weakens the effects of Bose statistics, i.e. contributions\nof effectively multi-charged states to higher order moments. Consequently, cuts\nin $p_t$ modify the experimentally measured cumulants and their ratios. We\ndiscuss the influence of kinematic cuts on the ratio of mean and variance of\nelectric charge fluctuations in a hadron resonance gas, in the light of recent\ndata of the STAR and PHENIX Collaborations.

Applying an external\nmagnetic field of sufficiently high intensity (in the range of 0.5-1 Tesla for\noperating pressures in the range of 5-15 atmospheres) causes the electrons to\nproduce helical tracks. Assuming the tracks can be properly reconstructed, the\nsign (direction) of curvature can be determined at several points along these\ntracks, and such information can be used to separate signal (0nbb) events\ncontaining two electrons producing a track with two different directions of\ncurvature from background (single-electron) events producing a track that\nshould spiral in a single direction.

To test the accuracy of these methods, a simple model is used to\nsimulate di-hadron and jet-hadron correlations with a combinatorial background\nsimilar to that observed in the data.

For a proper interpretation of\nthe data, final-state interactions (FSI) need to be theoretically controlled.\n  Purpose: Our goal is to quantify the role of FSI effects in exclusive\n$A(e,e'pN)$ reactions for four target nuclei representative for the whole mass\nregion. Our focus is on processes that are SRC driven. We investigate the role\nof FSI for two characteristic detector setups corresponding with a \"small\" and\n\"large\" coverage of the available phase space.\n  Results: The transparency $T^{pN}_{A}$, defined as the ratio of exclusive\n$(e,e'pN)$ cross sections on nuclei to those on \"free\" nucleon pairs, drops\nfrom $ 0.2-0.3 $ for $^{12}$C to $0.04-0.07$ for $^{208}$Pb.

In this\ncontext accelerator-based neutrino experiments need a reduction of systematic\nerrors to the level of a few percent. Today one of the most important sources\nof systematic errors are neutrino-nucleus cross sections which in the\nhundreds-MeV to few-GeV energy region are known with a precision not exceeding\n20%. In this article we review the present experimental and theoretical\nknowledge of the neutrino-nucleus interaction physics. After introducing\nneutrino oscillation physics and accelerator-based neutrino experiments, we\noverview general aspects of the neutrino-nucleus cross sections, both\ntheoretical and experimental views. Then we focus on these quantities in\ndifferent reaction channels. We start with the quasielastic and\nquasielastic-like cross section, putting a special emphasis on multinucleon\nemission channel which attracted a lot of attention in the last few years. We\nreview the main aspects of the different microscopic models for this channel by\ndiscussing analogies and differences among them.The discussion is always driven\nby a comparison with the experimental data. We then consider the one pion\nproduction channel where data-theory agreement remains very unsatisfactory. We\ndescribe how to interpret pion data, then we analyze in particular the puzzle\nrelated to the impossibility of theoretical models and Monte Carlo to\nsimultaneously describe MiniBooNE and MINERvA experimental results. Inclusive\ncross sections are also discussed, as well as the comparison between the\n$\\nu_\\mu$ and $\\nu_e$ cross sections, relevant for the CP violation\nexperiments. The impact of the nuclear effects on the reconstruction of\nneutrino energy and on the determination of the neutrino oscillation parameters\nis reviewed.

They consist of a core and one or a few nucleons which spend most of\ntheir time in the classically-forbidden region outside the range of the\ninteraction. Individual nucleons inside the core are thus unresolved in the\nhalo configuration, and the low-energy effective interactions are short-range\nforces between the core and the valence nucleons. Similar phenomena occur in\nclusters of $^4$He atoms, cold atomic gases near a Feshbach resonance, and some\nexotic hadrons.

Since the adopted model provides the excitation energy distribution\nof these primordial fragments, it allows one to calculate the temperatures of\ndifferent isotope families and infer on the sensitivity to their isospin\ncomposition. It is found that, due to the functional form of the nuclear\ndensity of states and the excitation energy distribution of the fragments,\nproton rich isotopes are hotter than neutron rich ones.

It is well known, however, that\nthe quenching of jets from their interaction with the medium leads to a\nmigration of jets from higher to lower $p_T$, making it challenging to directly\ninfer the degree and mechanism of jet energy loss. Our proposed quantile\nmatching procedure is inspired by (but not reliant on) the approximate\nmonotonicity of energy loss in the jet $p_T$. In this strategy, jets in\nheavy-ion collisions ordered by $p_T$ are viewed as modified versions of the\nsame number of highest-energy jets in proton-proton collisions, and the\nfractional energy loss as a function of jet $p_T$ is a natural observable\n($Q_{\\rm AA}$).

In a naive picture the latter are directly related to the impact\nparameter of the two nuclei, which sets also the initial eccentricity of the\nsystem: zero in the case of the most central events and getting larger for more\nperipheral collisions. A more realistic modelling requires to take into account\nevent-by-event fluctuations, in particular in the nucleon positions within the\ncolliding nuclei: collisions belonging to the same centrality class can give\nrise to systems with different initial eccentricity and hence different flow\nharmonics for the final hadron distributions.

Abstract: The onset of thermalization in heavy ion collisions in the weak coupling\nframework can be viewed as a transition from the initial state Color Glass\nCondensate dynamics, characterized by the energy density scaling like $\\epsilon\n\\sim 1/\\tau$ with $\\tau$ the proper time, to the hydrodynamics-driven expansion\nof the quark-gluon plasma with $\\epsilon \\sim 1/\\tau^{4/3}$ (or higher power of\n$1/\\tau$ for the boost non-invariant case). We argue that, at any order of the\nperturbative expansion in the QCD coupling constant, the gluon field generated\nin an ultrarelativistic heavy ion collision leads to energy density scaling as\n$\\epsilon \\sim 1/\\tau$ for late times $\\tau \\gg 1/Q_s$. Therefore it is likely\nthat thermalization and hydrodynamic description of the gluon system produced\nin heavy ion collisions can not result from perturbative QCD diagrams at these\nlate times. At earlier times with $\\tau \\sim 1/Q_s$ the subleading corrections\nto $\\epsilon$ in $1/\\tau$ expansion (terms scaling like $\\sim\n1/\\tau^{1+\\Delta}$ with $\\Delta >0$) may become important possibly leading to\nhydrodynamic-like behavior of the gluon system. Still, we show that such\ncorrections do not contribute to the particle production cross section, and are\nlikely to be irrelevant for physical observables. We generalize our results by\nincluding massless quarks into the system. Thus, it appears that the apparent\nthermalization of quarks and gluons, leading to success of Bjorken\nhydrodynamics in describing heavy ion collisions at RHIC, can only be\nattributed to the non-perturbative QCD effects. \n\n"}

By studying these fluctuations as a\nfunction of varying control parameters, it is possible to learn much about the\nphase diagram of QCD. As a timely example, we stress the methods by which\npresent experiments at the CERN SPS can locate the second-order critical\nendpoint of the first-order transition between quark-gluon plasma and hadron\nmatter. Those event-by-event signatures which are characteristic of freeze-out\nin the vicinity of the critical point will exhibit nonmonotonic dependence on\ncontrol parameters. We focus on observables constructed from the multiplicity\nand transverse momenta of charged pions. We first consider how the\nevent-by-event fluctuations of such observables are affected by Bose-Einstein\ncorrelations, by resonances which decay after freeze-out and by fluctuations in\nthe transverse flow velocity. We compare our thermodynamic predictions for such\nnoncritical event-by-event fluctuations with NA49 data, finding broad\nagreement. We then focus on effects due to thermal contact between the observed\npions and a heat bath with a given (possibly singular) specific heat, and due\nto the direct coupling between the critical fluctuations of the sigma field and\nthe observed pions. We also discuss the effect of the pions produced in the\ndecay of sigma particles just above threshold after freeze-out on the inclusive\npion spectrum and on multiplicity fluctuations.

Many different phenomena can lead both to\nthe creation and to the suppression of a fluctuation peak. In particular, the\nrole of constraints due to conservation laws and to data sorting is shown to be\nessential. From the experimental point of view, a comparison of the available\nfragmentation data reveals that there is a good agreement between different\ndata sets of basic fluctuation observables, if the fragmenting source is of\ncomparable size.

The inverse slopes of kaons are larger\nthan those of pions. The difference in the inverse slopes of pions, kaons and\nprotons, all measured in our spectrometer, increases with system size and is\nconsistent with the buildup of collective flow for larger systems. The target\ndependence of both the yields and inverse slopes is stronger for the sulphur\nbeam suggesting the increased importance of secondary rescattering for SA\nreactions. The rapidity density, dN/dy, of both K+ and K- increases more\nrapidly with system size than for pi+ in a similar rapidity region. This trend\ncontinues with increasing centrality, and according to RQMD, it is caused by\nsecondary reactions between mesons and baryons.

Starting from these considerations, I\nwill finally comment on the often debated question: ``is there any chance that\nall physicists will become Bayesian?'' \n\n"}

This\neffect may pave a way for a quantum computing, with a large number of qubits\n$n\\simeq 100$--1000, far beyond the quantum chaos border. One of the\nmanifestations of such a thermalized non-equilibrated matter is revealed by a\nstrong asymmetry around 90$^\\circ $ c.m. of evaporating proton yield in the\nBi($\\gamma$,p) photonuclear reaction. The effect is described in terms of\nanomalously slow cross symmetry phase relaxation in highly excited quantum\nmany-body systems with exponentially large Hilbert space dimensions. In the\nabove reaction this phase relaxation is about eight orders of magnitude slower\nthan energy relaxation (thermalization). \n\n"}
