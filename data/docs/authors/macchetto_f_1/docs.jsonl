Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days.

As young AGN\n(quasars) they are initially several magnitudes sub-luminous to mature galaxies\nbut their luminosity gradually increases over 10^8 yrs, as z_(i) decreases and\nthey evolve into mature AGN (Seyferts and radio galaxies). Evidence presented\nhere that low- and intermediate-redshift AGN are unquestionably sub-luminous to\nradio galaxies is then strong support for this model and makes it likely that\nthe high-redshift AGN (quasars) are also sub-luminous, having simply been\npushed above the radio galaxies on a logz-m_(v) plot by the presence of a large\nintrinsic component in their redshifts.

The galaxy is known to possess a dramatic 70 kpc\nX-ray tail. The detected H-alpha tail coincides positionally with the X-ray\ntail. The H-alpha emission in the galaxy is sharply truncated on the front and\nthe sides near the nucleus, indicating significant ram pressure stripping. ESO\n137-001 is thus the first cluster late-type galaxy known unambiguously with\nboth an X-ray tail and an H-alpha tail. The emission-line objects are all\ndistributed downstream of the galaxy, with projected distance up to 39 kpc from\nthe galaxy. From the analysis on the H-alpha_{off} frame and the estimate of\nthe background emission-line objects, we conclude that it is very likely all 29\nemission-line objects are HII regions in A3627.

It was originally estimated that only one or two\nof the essential evolutionary steps had to have been hard in this sense, but it\nhas become apparent that this figure may need upward revision, because recent\nstudies of climatic instability suggest that the possible future duration of\nour biologically favourable environment may be shorter than had been supposed,\nonly about one Giga year rather than five. On the basis of the statistical\nrequirement of roughly equal spacing between hard steps, it is argued that the\nbest fit with the fossil record is now obtainable by postulating the number of\nhard steps to be five, if our evolution was exclusively terrestrial, or six if,\nas now seems very plausible, the first step occurred on Mars. \n\n"}

Indeed, merely a single case of a star-planet-disk\nsystem has previously been detected at submillimeter (submm) wavelengths.\nConsequently, one of our aims is to understand the reasons for these poor\nstatistics, i.e., whether these results reflected the composition and/or the\nphysics of the planetary disks or were simply due to observational bias and\nselection effects. Finding more examples would be very significant. The\nselected target, q1 Eri, is a solar-type star, which was known to possess a\nplanet, q1 Eri b, and to exhibit excess emission at IRAS wavelengths, but had\nremained undetected in the millimeter regime. Therefore, submm flux densities\nwould be needed to better constrain the physical characteristics of the\nplanetary disk. Consequently, we performed submm imaging observations of q1\nEri. The detected dust toward q1 Eri at 870 micron exhibits the remarkable fact\nthat the entire SED, from the IR to mm-wavelengths, is fit by a single\ntemperature blackbody function (60 K). This would imply that the emitting\nregions are confined to a narrow region (ring) at radial distances much larger\nthan the orbital distance of q1 Eri b, and that the emitting particles are\nconsiderably larger than some hundred micron. However, the 870 micron source is\nextended, with a full-width-half-maximum of roughly 600 AU.

Such binaries form after major galaxy\nmergers, but their fate is unclear since hardening through stellar scattering\nbecomes very inefficient at sub-parsec distances. Gas discs may dominate binary\ndynamics on these scales, and promote mergers. Using numerical simulations, we\ninvestigate the evolution of the orbits of binaries embedded within\ngeometrically thin gas discs. Our simulations directly resolve angular momentum\ntransport within the disc, which at the radii of interest is likely dominated\nby disc self-gravity. We show that the binary decays at a rate which is in good\nagreement with analytical estimates, while the eccentricity grows. Saturation\nof eccentricity growth is not observed up to values e > 0.35. Accretion onto\nthe black holes is variable, and is roughly modulated by the binary orbital\nfrequency. Scaling our results, we analytically estimate the maximum rate of\nbinary decay that is possible without fragmentation occuring within the\nsurrounding gas disc, and compare that rate to an estimate of the stellar\ndynamical hardening rate. For binary masses in the range 10^5 < M/Msun < 10^8\nwe find that decay due to gas discs may dominate for separations below a ~\n0.01--0.1 pc, where the disc is optically thick.

Dark matter particles that end up within two virial\nradii of a Milky-Way-sized DM halo at $z=0$ have an approximately Gaussian\ndistribution in log(f) at early redshifts, but the distribution becomes\nincreasingly skewed at lower redshifts. The value corresponding to the peak of\nthe Gaussian decreases as the evolution progresses and is well described by a\npower-law in (1+z). The highest values of f are found at the centers of dark\nmatter halos and subhalos, where f can be an order of magnitude higher than in\nthe center of the main halo. The power-law Q(r) profile likely reflects the\ndistribution of entropy (K = sigma^2/rho^{2/3} \\propto r^{1.2}), which dark\nmatter acquires as it is accreted onto a growing halo.

The simultaneous satisfaction of\nthe WMAP relic density data and the PAMELA data is accomplished through a\nco-annihilation mechanism ($B_{\\rm Co}-mechanism$), and leads to predictions of\na neutralino and a chargino in the mass range (180-200) GeV as well as low\nlying sparticles accessible at colliders.

AGN luminosities were estimated in two ways, always taking care to\nminimise photometric biases due to host galaxy light contamination. Firstly, we\nmeasured broad-band B_J (blue) magnitudes of the objects over small apertures\nof the size of the seeing disk. Secondly, we extracted H alpha and H beta broad\nemission line luminosities from the spectra which should be entirely free of\nany starlight contribution. The resulting AGN luminosity function (AGNLF) is\nconsistent with a single power law, also when considering the effects of number\ndensity evolution within the narrow redshift range. We compared our AGNLF with\nthe H alpha luminosity function of lower luminosity Seyfert 1 galaxies by Hao\net al.

In regions of low surface density, fragmentation during collapse\nleads to the formation of small clusters rather than individual massive star\nsystems, greatly reducing the fraction of the stellar population with masses >~\n10 Msun. Our simulations have important implications for the formation of\nmassive stars and the universality of the IMF. \n\n"}

In the case of supermassive\nblack holes at the centres of galaxies this has been known for decades, but for\nstellar-mass black holes residing within galaxies like our own, it has taken\nrecent advances to arrive at this conclusion. Here, a review is given of the\nevidence that supports the existence of jets from accreting stellar-mass black\nholes, from observations made at optical and infrared wavelengths. In\nparticular it is found that on occasion, jets can dominate the emission of\nthese systems at these wavelengths. In addition, the interactions between the\njets and the surrounding matter produce optical and infrared emission on large\nscales via thermal and non-thermal processes. The evidence, implications and\napplications in the context of jet physics are discussed. It is shown that many\nproperties of the jets can be constrained from these studies, including the\ntotal kinetic power they contain. The main conclusion is that like the\nsupermassive black holes, the jet kinetic power of accreting stellar-mass black\nholes is sometimes comparable to their bolometric radiative luminosity. Future\nstudies can test ubiquities in jet properties between objects, and attempt to\nunify the properties of jets from all observable accreting black holes, i.e. of\nall masses. \n\n"}

To investigate the observed trends we derive\ntheoretical predictions of GC system scaling parameters as a function of host\ngalaxy mass based on the models of Dekel & Birnboim (2006) in which\nstar-formation processes are regulated by stellar and supernova feedback below\na stellar mass of 3x10^10 M_sol, and by virial shocks above it. We find that\nthe analytical model describes remarkably well the shape of the GC system\nscaling parameter distributions with a universal specific GC formation\nefficiency, eta, which relates the total mass in GCs to the total galaxy halo\nmass. Early-type and late-type galaxies show a similar mean value of eta =\n5.5e-5, with an increasing scatter towards lower galaxy masses.

This gives a consistent description of the quenching\nmechanism in mean-field dynamo models. The main goal of this work is to explore\nthe effects of this quenching mechanism in solar-like geometry, and in\nparticular to investigate the role of magnetic helicity fluxes, specifically\ndiffusive and Vishniac-Cho (VC) fluxes, at large magnetic Reynolds numbers\n(Rm). For models with negative radial shear or positive latitudinal shear, the\nmagnetic alpha effect has predominantly negative (positive) sign in the\nnorthern (southern) hemisphere. In the absence of fluxes, we find that the\nmagnetic energy follows an Rm^-1 dependence, as found in previous works. This\ncatastrophic quenching is alleviated in models with diffusive magnetic helicity\nfluxes resulting in magnetic fields comparable to the equipartition value even\nfor Rm=10^7. On the other hand, models with a shear-driven Vishniac-Cho flux\nshow an increase of the amplitude of the magnetic field with respect to models\nwithout fluxes, but only for Rm<10^4.

Our\nparticle-gas hybrid scheme is based on a second order predictor-corrector\nmethod. Careful treatment of the momentum feedback on the gas guarantees exact\nconservation. The hybrid scheme is stable and convergent in most regimes\nrelevant to protoplanetary disks. We describe a semi-implicit integrator\ngeneralized from the leap-frog approach.

We also present a\nfully-implicit integrator that is unconditionally stable for all regimes of\nparticle-gas coupling.

We generalize the spherical collapse model in the case\nwhen the vacuum energy is a running function of the Hubble rate,\n$\\Lambda=\\Lambda(H)$.

Methods: We calculate the neutrino flux from $\\beta$\nprocesses using nuclear statistical equilibrium abundances convoluted with\napproximate neutrino spectra of the individual nuclei and the thermal neutrino\nspectrum (pair+plasma). Results: Although the two considered thermonuclear\nsupernova explosion scenarios are expected to produce almost identical\nelectromagnetic output, their neutrino signatures appear vastly different,\nwhich allow an unambiguous identification of the explosion mechanism: a pure\ndeflagration produces a single peak in the neutrino light curve, while the\naddition of the second maximum characterizes a delayed-detonation. We\nidentified the following main contributors to the neutrino signal: (1) weak\nelectron neutrino emission from electron captures (in particular on the protons\nCo55 and Ni56) and numerous beta-active nuclei produced by the thermonuclear\nflame and/or detonation front, (2) electron antineutrinos from positron\ncaptures on neutrons, and (3) the thermal emission from pair annihilation. We\nestimate that a pure deflagration supernova explosion at a distance of 1 kpc\nwould trigger about 14 events in the future 50 kt liquid scintillator detector\nand some 19 events in a 0.5 Mt water Cherenkov-type detector. Conclusions:\nWhile in contrast to core-collapse supernovae neutrinos carry only a very small\nfraction of the energy produced in the thermonuclear supernova explosion, the\nSN Ia neutrino signal provides information that allows us to unambiguously\ndistinguish between different possible explosion scenarios.

We improve upon previous calibrations in three ways.\nWe use both a volume-limited and kinematically-matched sample of F and G dwarfs\nfrom the Geneva-Copehnagen Survey (GCS) to infer the mean metallicity of M\ndwarfs in the Solar Neighborhood, we use theoretical models of M dwarf\ninteriors and atmospheres to determine the effect of metallicity on M dwarfs in\nthe V-K_s--M_Ks CMD, and we base our final calibration purely on\nhigh-resolution spectroscopy of FGK primaries with M dwarf companions. As a\nresult, we explain an order of magnitude more of the variance in the\ncalibration sample than previous photometric calibrations. We\nnon-parametrically quantify the significance of the observation that M dwarfs\nthat host exoplanets are preferentially in a region of the V-K_s--M_Ks plane\npopulated by metal-rich M dwarfs. We find that the probability p that\nplanet-hosting M dwarfs are distributed across the V-K_s--M_Ks CMD in the same\nway as field M dwarfs is p = 0.06 +/- 0.008. Interestingly, the subsample of M\ndwarfs that host Neptune and sub-Neptune mass planets may also be\npreferentially located in the region of the V-K_s--M_Ks plane populated by\nhigh-metallicity M dwarfs.

We construct a quark equation of state, based on the\nbag model for strange quark matter. The transition between the hadronic and the\nquark phases is constructed applying Gibbs conditions. The resulting\nquark-hadron hybrid equations of state are used in core-collapse supernova\nsimulations, based on general relativistic radiation hydrodynamics and three\nflavor Boltzmann neutrino transport in spherical symmetry. The formation of a\nmixed phase reduces the adiabatic index, which induces the gravitational\ncollapse of the central protoneutron star. The collapse halts in the pure quark\nphase, where the adiabatic index increases. A strong accretion shock forms,\nwhich propagates towards the protoneutron star surface. Due to the density\ndecrease of several orders of magnitude, the accretion shock turns into a\ndynamic shock with matter outflow. This moment defines the onset of the\nexplosion in supernova models that allow for a quark-hadron phase transition,\nwhere otherwise no explosions could be obtained. The shock propagation across\nthe neutrinospheres releases a burst of neutrinos. This serves as a strong\nobservable identification for the structural reconfiguration of the stellar\ncore. The ejected matter expands on a short timescale and remains neutron-rich.\nThese conditions might be suitable for the production of heavy elements via the\nr-process. The neutron-rich material is followed by proton-rich neutrino-driven\nejecta in the later cooling phase of the protoneutron star where the vp-process\nmight occur. \n\n"}

In this work, we create detailed models for a range of old simple\nstellar populations (SSPs), to create a variety of realistic HB morphologies,\nfrom extended red clumps, to extreme blue HBs. We achieve this by utilising\nstellar tracks from the BaSTI database and implementing a different mass loss\nprescription for each SSP created, resulting in different HB morphologies. We\nfind that, for each metallicity, there is some HB morphology which maximises\nHbeta, making an underlying 14Gyr population look ~5-6Gyr old for the low and\nintermediate metallicity cases, and as young as 2Gyr for a solar metallicity\nSSP.

Reversible-jump\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) is an extremely powerful technique for\nperforming Bayesian model selection, but it suffers from a fundamental\ndifficulty: it requires jumps between model parameter spaces, but cannot\nefficiently explore both parameter spaces at once. Thus, a naive jump between\nparameter spaces is unlikely to be accepted in the MCMC algorithm and\nconvergence is correspondingly slow.

In order to understand the origin of S0s\nin groups, we investigate numerically the morphological transformation of\nspirals into S0s through group-related physical processes. Our chemodynamical\nsimulations show that spirals in group environments can be strongly influenced\nby repetitive slow encounters with group member galaxies so that those with\nthin disks and prominent spiral arm structures can be transformed into S0s with\nthick disks and without prominent spiral arm structure. Such tidal interactions\ncan also trigger repetitive starbursts within the bulges of spirals and\nconsequently increase significantly the masses of their bulges. Owing to rapid\nconsumption of gas initially in spirals during the bulge growth, the S0s can\nbecome gas-poor. The S0s transformed from spirals in this way have young and\nmetal-rich stellar populations in the inner regions of their bulges. The\nsimulated S0s have lower maximum rotational velocities and flatter radial\nline-of-sight velocity dispersion profiles in comparison to their progenitor\nspirals.

Contrary to previous understanding, we show\nthat field star encounters play a pivotal role in setting the Oort Cloud's\nextreme inner edge, and due to their stochastic nature this inner edge\nsometimes extends to Sedna's orbit. The Sun's galactic migration heightens the\nchance of powerful stellar passages, and Sedna production occurs around ~20-30%\nof the solar-like stars we study. Considering the entire Oort Cloud, we find\nits median distance depends on the minimum galactocentric distance attained\nduring the Sun's orbital history. The inner edge also shows a similar\ndependence but with increased scatter due to the effects of powerful stellar\nencounters. Both of these Oort Cloud parameters can vary by an order of\nmagnitude and are usually overestimated by an Oort Cloud formation model that\nassumes a fixed galactic environment. In addition, the amount of material\ntrapped in outer Oort Cloud orbits can be extremely low and may present\ndifficulties for models of Oort Cloud formation and long-period comet\nproduction. \n\n"}

Among these phenomena are\nphotospheric turbulence, line profile variability (LPV), non-thermal emission,\nnon-radial pulsations, discrete absorption components (DACs) and wind clumping.\nCantiello et al. (2009) argued that a convection zone close to the stellar\nsurface could be responsible for some of these phenomena. This convective zone\nis caused by a peak in the opacity associated with iron-group elements and is\nreferred to as the \"iron convection zone\" (FeCZ). Assuming dynamo action\nproducing magnetic fields at equipartition in the FeCZ, we investigate the\noccurrence of subsurface magnetism in OB stars. Then we study the surface\nemergence of these magnetic fields and discuss possible observational\nsignatures of magnetic spots. Simple estimates are made using the subsurface\nproperties of massive stars, as calculated in 1D stellar evolution models. We\nfind that magnetic fields of sufficient amplitude to affect the wind could\nemerge at the surface via magnetic buoyancy. While at this stage it is\ndifficult to predict the geometry of these features, we show that magnetic\nspots of size comparable to the local pressure scale height can manifest\nthemselves as hot, bright spots.

The fraction of TD-producing mergers where both parents are\nearly-type galaxies is <2%, suggesting that TDs are unlikely to form in such\nmergers. The bulk of TD-producing systems inhabit a field environment and have\nmass ratios greater than 1:7 (the median value is 1:2.5). TDs forming at the\ntidal-tail tips are ~4 times more massive than those forming at the base of the\ntails. TDs have stellar masses that are less than 10% of the stellar masses of\ntheir parents and typically lie within 15 optical half-light radii of their\nparent galaxies. The TD population is typically bluer than the parents, with a\nmedian offset of ~0.3 mag in the (g-r) colour and the TD colours are not\naffected by the presence of AGN activity in their parents. An analysis of their\nstar formation histories indicates that TDs contain both newly formed stars\n(with a median age of ~30 Myr) and old stars drawn from the parent disks, each\ncomponent probably contributing roughly equally to their stellar mass. Thus,\nTDs are not formed purely through gas condensation in tidal tails but host a\nsignificant component of old stars from the parent disks. Finally, an analysis\nof the TD contribution to the local dwarf-to-massive galaxy ratio indicates\nthat ~6% of dwarfs in nearby clusters may have a tidal origin, if TD production\nrates in nearby mergers are representative of those in the high-redshift\nUniverse.

The\nso called local bias model, where galaxy density is a function of local matter\ndensity, is frequently discussed as a means to infer the matter power spectrum\nor correlation function from the measured galaxy correlation. However,\ngravitational evolution generates a term quadratic in the tidal tensor and thus\nnon-local in the density field, even if this term is absent in the initial\nconditions (Lagrangian space). Because the term is quadratic, it contributes as\na loop correction to the power spectrum, so the standard linear bias picture\nstill applies on large scales, however, it contributes at leading order to the\nbispectrum for which it is significant on all scales. Such a term could also be\npresent in Lagrangian space if halo formation were influenced by the tidal\nfield. We measure the corresponding coupling strengths from the\nmatter-matter-halo bispectrum in numerical simulations and find a non-vanishing\ncoefficient for the tidal tensor term. We find no scale dependence of the bias\nparameters up to k=0.1 h/Mpc and that the tidal effect is increasing with halo\nmass. While the Lagrangian bias picture is a better description of our results\nthan the Eulerian bias picture, our results suggest that there might be a tidal\ntensor bias already in the initial conditions. We also find that the\ncoefficients of the quadratic density term deviate quite strongly from the\ntheoretical predictions based on the spherical collapse model and a universal\nmass function.

Abstract: Galaxy clusters are among the best targets for indirect dark matter detection\nin gamma-rays, despite the large astrophysical background expected from these\nobjects. Detection is now within reach of current observatories (Fermi-LAT or\nCerenkov telescopes); however, assessing the origin of this signal might be\ndifficult. We investigate whether the behaviour of the number of objects per\n`flux' bin (logN-logF) and that of the stacked signal could be used as a\nsignature of the dominant process at stake.We use the CLUMPY code to integrate\nthe signal from decaying or annihilating dark matter and cosmic rays along the\nline of sight. We assume the standard NFW profile for the dark matter density\nand rely on a parametrised emissivity for the cosmic-ray component. In this\ncontext, the consequences of stacking are explored using the MCXC\nmeta-catalogue of galaxy clusters. We find the value of the slope of the\nlogN-logF power law (or the increase of the signal with the number of stacked\nobjects) to be a clear diagnosis to disentangle decaying dark matter from\ncosmic-ray induced gamma-rays. For dark matter annihilation, depending on the\nsignal boost from the substructures, it is either similar to the cosmic-ray\nsignal (no boost) or similar to the decay case (large boosts). The shift\nbetween the brightest object and its followers also depends on the signal\norigin. For annihilation, this shift and the stacked signal are poorly\nconstrained because of the large uncertainty affecting the boost. We also\nunderline that the angular dependence of the annihilation signal is not\nuniversal because of the substructure contribution. \n\n"}

We use 3 million particles to\nstudy the formation and evolution of the SMBH binary till it becomes hard.\nAfter a hard binary is formed, we reduce (reselect) the particles to 1.15\nmillion and follow the subsequent shrinking of the SMBH binary due to 3-body\nencounters with the stars.

One proposed signature of oceans is\nspecular reflection (\"glint\"), which increases the apparent albedo of a planet\nat crescent phases. We post-process a global climate model of an Earth-like\nplanet to simulate reflected lightcurves. Significantly, we obtain glint-like\nphase variations even though we do not include specular reflection in our\nmodel. This false positive is the product of two generic properties: 1) for\nmodest obliquities, a planet's poles receive less orbit-averaged stellar flux\nthan its equator, so the poles are more likely to be covered in highly\nreflective snow and ice, and 2) we show that reflected light from a\nmodest-obliquity planet at crescent phases probes higher latitudes than at\ngibbous phases, therefore a planet's apparent albedo will naturally increase at\ncrescent phase. We suggest that this \"latitude-albedo effect\" will operate even\nfor large obliquities: in that case the equator receives less orbit-averaged\nflux than the poles, and the equator is preferentially sampled at crescent\nphase. Using rotational and orbital color variations to map the surfaces of\ndirectly imaged planets and estimate their obliquity will therefore be a\nnecessary pre-condition for properly interpreting their reflected phase\nvariations. The latitude-albedo effect is a particularly convincing glint false\npositive for zero-obliquity planets, and such worlds are not amenable to\nlatitudinal mapping. This effect severely limits the utility of specular\nreflection for detecting oceans on exoplanets. \n\n"}

The Role of Radiation Pressure Abstract: Massive stars provide feedback that shapes the interstellar medium of\ngalaxies at all redshifts and their resulting stellar populations. Here we\npresent three adaptive mesh refinement radiation hydrodynamics simulations that\nillustrate the impact of momentum transfer from ionising radiation to the\nabsorbing gas on star formation in high-redshift dwarf galaxies. Momentum\ntransfer is calculated by solving the radiative transfer equation with a ray\ntracing algorithm that is adaptive in spatial and angular coordinates. We find\nthat momentum input partially affects star formation by increasing the\nturbulent support to a three-dimensional rms velocity equal to the circular\nvelocity of early haloes. Compared to a calculation that neglects radiation\npressure, the star formation rate is decreased by a factor of five to 1.8 x\n10^{-2} Msun/yr in a dwarf galaxy with a dark matter and stellar mass of 2.0 x\n10^8 and 4.5 x 10^5 solar masses, respectively, when radiation pressure is\nincluded. Its mean metallicity of 10^{-2.1} Z_sun is consistent with the\nobserved dwarf galaxy luminosity-metallicity relation. However, what one may\nnaively expect from the calculation without radiation pressure, the central\nregion of the galaxy overcools and produces a compact, metal-rich stellar\npopulation with an average metallicity of 0.3 Z_sun, indicative of an incorrect\nphysical recipe. In addition to photo-heating in HII regions, radiation\npressure further drives dense gas from star forming regions, so supernovae\nfeedback occurs in a warmer and more diffuse medium, launching metal-rich\noutflows. Capturing this aspect and a temporal separation between the start of\nradiative and supernova feedback are numerically important in the modeling of\ngalaxies to avoid the \"overcooling problem\".

In the Milky Way,\nclusters with more than 2000 stars only form in two types - starburst clusters\nand leaky clusters - each following a unique temporal development in the\nmass-radius plane. The aim is here to determine the encounter probability in\nthe range relevant to solar system formation for starburst or leaky cluster\nenvironments as a function of cluster age. N-body methods are used to\ninvestigate the cluster dynamics and the effect of gravitational interactions\nbetween cluster members on young solar-type stars surrounded by discs. Using\nthe now available knowledge of the cluster density at a given cluster age it is\ndemonstrated that in starburst clusters the central densities over the first\n5Myr are so high (initially > 10^5 Msun pc^{-3}) that hardly any discs with\nsolar system building potential would survive this phase.

The clumps show, for the first time in a \"dense\ngas tracer\", a significant correlation between HCO+ line emission from cold\nmolecular gas and Br{\\gamma} line emission of associated nebulae. This\ncorrelation arises in the HCO+ line's brightness, not its linewidth. In\ncontrast, the correlation between the N2H+ line emission and Br{\\gamma} is weak\nor absent. The HCO+/N2H+ line ratio also varies widely from clump to clump:\nbright HCO+ emission tends to be more closely associated with Br{\\gamma}\nnebulosity, while bright N2H+ emission tends to avoid areas that are bright in\nBr{\\gamma}. Both molecular species show correlations of weak significance with\ninfrared H2 v=1-0 and v=2-1 line emission, in or near the clumps. The H2\nemission line ratio is consistent with fluorescent excitation in most of the\nclumps, although thermal excitation is seen in a few clumps.

This suggests that some traditional dense gas tracers\nof molecular clouds do not sample a homogeneous population of clumps, i.e.,\nthat the HCO+ brightness in particular is directly related to the heating and\ndisruption of cold gas by massive young stars, whereas the N2H+ better samples\ngas not yet affected by this process.

The Gamma*theta_j parameter is important for jet physics\nbecause it is related to the jet-frame sidewise expansion speed and causal\nconnection between the jet edges and its symmetry axis. Most importantly, the\nstandard model of jet production requires that the jet be causally connected\nwith its symmetry axis, implying that Gamma*theta_j < 1. When we apply our\nmethod to the MOJAVE flux density limited sample of radio loud objects, we find\nGamma*theta_j = 0.2, implying that AGN jets are causally connected.

This degeneracy cannot be broken with geometric probes like the\nType Ia supernovae, the cosmic microwave background or the baryon acoustic\noscillations since they are based on the measurement of distances and scales\nand therefore require the expansion history $H(z)$, so one may only hope to\nbreak this degeneracy by using dynamic probes like the growth rate data that\ntrack the matter density perturbations. We demonstrate that breaking this\ndegeneracy is not currently possible by explicitly constructing $f(R)$, $f(G)$\nand $f(T)$ theories that mimic exactly the $\\Lambda$CDM model at the background\nlevel and confronting them against the latest observational cosmological data.\nWe also determine the necessary improvement in the growth rate data in order to\ndiscriminate these theories from $\\Lambda$CDM. We found that at least a\nthreefold improvement is necessary, something which will be possible with a\nsurvey like Euclid. \n\n"}

Large deviations between the abundances of\nthe host star and its gas giants seem likely to occur if the planet formation\nfollows the core-accretion scenario. These deviations stem from the separate\nevolution of gas and dust in the disk, where the dust forms the planet cores,\nfollowed by the final run-away accretion of the left-over gas. ProDiMo\nprotoplanetary disk models are used to predict the chemical evolution of gas\nand ice in the midplane. We find that cosmic rays play a crucial role in slowly\nun-blocking the CO, where the liberated oxygen forms water, which then freezes\nout quickly. Therefore, the C/O ratio in the gas phase is found to gradually\nincrease with time, in a region bracketed by the water and CO ice-lines. In\nthis regions, C/O is found to approach unity after about 5 Myrs, scaling with\nthe cosmic ray ionisation rate. We then explore how the atmospheric chemistry\nand cloud properties in young gas giants are affected when the non-solar C/O\nratios predicted by the disk models are assumed. The DRIFT cloud formation\nmodel is applied to study the formation of atmospheric clouds under the\ninfluence of varying primordial element abundances and its feedback onto the\nlocal gas.

Its noise and sensitivity performance were\nexcellent, but the rate of cosmic ray impacts on the HFI detectors was\nunexpectedly high. Furthermore, collisions of cosmic rays with the focal plane\nproduced transient signals in the data (glitches) with a wide range of\ncharacteristics. A study of cosmic ray impacts on the HFI detector modules has\nbeen undertaken to categorize and characterize the glitches, to correct the HFI\ntime-ordered data, and understand the residual effects on Planck maps and data\nproducts. This paper presents an evaluation of the physical origins of glitches\nobserved by the HFI detectors. In order to better understand the glitches\nobserved by HFI in flight, several ground-based experiments were conducted with\nflight-spare HFI bolometer modules. The experiments were conducted between 2010\nand 2013 with HFI test bolometers in different configurations using varying\nparticles and impact energies. The bolometer modules were exposed to 23 MeV\nprotons from the Orsay IPN TANDEM accelerator, and to $^{241}$Am and $^{244}$Cm\n$\\alpha$-particle and $^{55}$Fe radioactive X-ray sources. The calibration data\nfrom the HFI ground-based preflight tests were used to further characterize the\nglitches and compare glitch rates with statistical expectations under\nlaboratory conditions. Test results provide strong evidence that the dominant\nfamily of glitches observed in flight are due to cosmic ray absorption by the\nsilicon die substrate on which the HFI detectors reside. Glitch energy is\npropagated to the thermistor by ballistic phonons, while there is also a\nthermal diffusion contribution. The implications of these results for future\nsatellite missions, especially those in the far-infrared to sub-millimetre and\nmillimetre regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, are discussed. \n\n"}

The study is\nbased on the analysis of hydrodynamically simulated galaxies from dwarf to\nMilky Way mass, drawn from the MaGICC project, which have been shown to match a\nwide range of disk scaling relationships.

As the neutrons are\nsuperfluid their angular momentum is carried by an array of quantized vortices.\nThese vortices can pin to the nuclear lattice and prevent the neutron\nsuperfluid from spinning down, allowing it to store angular momentum which can\nthen be released catastrophically, giving rise to a pulsar glitch. A crucial\ningredient for this model is the maximum pinning force that the lattice can\nexert on the vortices, as this allows us to estimate the angular momentum that\ncan be exchanged during a glitch. In this paper we perform, for the first time,\na detailed and quantitative calculation of the pinning force \\emph{per unit\nlength} acting on a vortex immersed in the crust and resulting from the\nmesoscopic vortex-lattice interaction.

The progenitor is a tight binary system composed by a\ncarbon-oxygen (CO) core and a neutron star (NS) companion. The explosion of the\nSN leads to hypercritical accretion onto the NS companion which reaches the\ncritical mass, hence inducing its gravitational collapse to a black hole (BH)\nwith consequent emission of the GRB. The first estimates of this process were\nbased on a simplified model of the binary parameters and the\nBondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion rate. We present here the first full numerical\nsimulations of the IGC phenomenon. We simulate the core-collapse and SN\nexplosion of CO stars to obtain the density and ejection velocity of the SN\nejecta. We follow the hydrodynamic evolution of the accreting material falling\ninto the Bondi-Hoyle surface of the NS all the way up to its incorporation to\nthe NS surface. The simulations go up to BH formation when the NS reaches the\ncritical mass. For appropriate binary parameters the IGC occurs in short\ntimescales (100-1000s) owing to the combined effective action of the photon\ntrapping and the neutrino cooling near the NS surface.

Although the synchrotron self-Compton model has been very successful in\nexplaining the spectral energy distribution and spectral variability of these\nsources, it has not been able to describe these atypical flaring events.

The main reason is that many of the NS in these systems appear to be\nspinning well below their Keplerian breakup frequency, and it has been\nsuggested that torques associated with GW emission may be setting the observed\nspin period. This assumption has been used extensively in the literature to\nassess the strength of the likely gravitational wave signal.

{"id": "1504.08355", "contents": "Title: Is the Universe logotropic? Abstract: We consider the possibility that the universe is made of a single dark fluid\ndescribed by a logotropic equation of state $P=A\\ln(\\rho/\\rho_*)$, where $\\rho$\nis the rest-mass density, $\\rho_*$ is a reference density, and $A$ is the\nlogotropic temperature. The energy density $\\epsilon$ is the sum of two terms:\na rest-mass energy term $\\rho c^2$ that mimics dark matter and an internal\nenergy term $u(\\rho)=-P(\\rho)-A$ that mimics dark energy. This decomposition\nleads to a natural, and physical, unification of dark matter and dark energy,\nand elucidates their mysterious nature. The logotropic model depends on a\nsingle parameter $B=A/\\rho_{\\Lambda}c^2$ where $\\rho_{\\Lambda}$ is the\ncosmological density. For $B=0$, we recover the $\\Lambda$CDM model. Using\ncosmological constraints, we find that $0\\le B\\le 0.09425$. We consider the\npossibility that dark matter halos are described by the same logotropic\nequation of state. When $B>0$, pressure gradients prevent gravitational\ncollapse and provide halo density cores instead of cuspy density profiles, in\nagreement with the observations. The universal rotation curve of logotropic\ndark matter halos is consistent with the observational Burkert profile up to\nthe halo radius. Interestingly, if we assume that all the dark matter halos\nhave the same logotropic temperature $B$, we find that their surface density\n$\\Sigma=\\rho_0 r_h$ is constant. This result is in agreement with the\nobservations where it is found that $\\Sigma_0=141\\, M_{\\odot}/{\\rm pc}^2$ for\ndark matter halos differing by several orders of magnitude in size.

Yet, despite these\nadvances, the extreme parameter regimes encountered in space physics and\nastrophysics (as in atmospheric and oceanic physics) still preclude direct\nnumerical simulation. Numerical models must take a Large Eddy Simulation (LES)\napproach, explicitly computing only a fraction of the active dynamical scales.\nThe success of such an approach hinges on how well the model can represent the\nsubgrid-scales (SGS) that are not explicitly resolved. In addition to the\nparameter regime, heliophysical and astrophysical applications must also face\nan equally daunting challenge: magnetism. The presence of magnetic fields in a\nturbulent, electrically conducting fluid flow can dramatically alter the\ncoupling between large and small scales, with potentially profound implications\nfor LES/SGS modeling.

The transition from a thin disk to an ADAF occurs when\nthe mass accretion rate is below a critical value. The critical mass accretion\nrate for the ADAF can be estimated by equating the equilibration timescale to\naccretion timescale of the ADAF, which is sensitive to its radial velocity. The\nradial velocity of thin disks is very small, which leads to the advection of\nthe external field in thin disks very inefficient. ADAFs are present in the\nlow/hard states of XRBs, and their radial velocity is large compared with the\nthin disk. The external field can be dragged inward efficiently by the ADAF, so\na strong large-scale magnetic field threading the ADAF can be formed, which may\naccelerate a fraction of gas in the ADAF into the outflows. Such outflows may\ncarry away a large amount of angular momentum from the ADAF, which increases\nthe radial velocity of the ADAF significantly. This leads to a high critical\nmass accretion rate, below which an ADAF with magnetic outflows can survive.\nOur calculations show that the critical luminosity of the ADAF with magnetic\noutflows can be one order of magnitude higher than that for a conventional\nADAF, if the ratio of gas to magnetic pressure $\\beta\\sim 4$ in the disk.

In\nparticular, we focus on the magnetic structure that produced an X3.1-class\nflare which is one of the X-class flares observed in AR 12192.

By\nconsidering an inhomogeneous mean flow effect on turbulence, it is shown that\nturbulent cross helicity (velocity--magnetic-field correlation) should enter\nthe expression of turbulent electromotive force as the coupling coefficient for\nthe mean absolute vorticity. The inclusion of the cross-helicity effect makes\nthe present model different from the current $\\alpha$--$\\Omega$-type models\nmainly in two points. First, in addition to the usual $\\alpha$ (helicity\neffect) and $\\beta$ (turbulent magnetic diffusivity), we consider the $\\gamma$\ncoefficient (cross-helicity effect) as a key ingredient of the dynamo process.\nSecond, unlike the $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ coefficients, which are often treated\nas an adjustable parameter in the current studies, the spatiotemporal evolution\nof $\\gamma$ coefficient is solved simultaneously with the mean magnetic-field\nequations. The basic scenario is as follows: In the presence of turbulent cross\nhelicity, the toroidal field is induced by the toroidal rotation in mediation\nby the turbulent cross helicity. The $\\alpha$ effect generates the poloidal\nfield from the toroidal one. This poloidal field produces a turbulent cross\nhelicity whose sign is opposite to the original one. Then a cycle of reversal\ncompletes. Eigenvalue analyses of the simplest possible present model give a\nbutterfly diagram, which confirms the above scenario as well as the\nequator-ward migrations, the phase relationship between the cross helicity and\nmagnetic fields, etc. These results suggest that the oscillation of the\nturbulent cross helicity is a key for the activity cycle. The reversal of the\nturbulent cross helicity is not the result of the magnetic-field reversal, but\nthe cause of the latter. This new model is expected to open up the possibility\nof the mean-field or turbulence closure dynamo approaches. \n\n"}

We focus on\nmodels that are consistent with the dark matter decay interpretation of the\nrecently detected line at 3.5 keV in the X-ray spectra of galaxies and\nclusters. In warm dark matter models the primordial spectrum of density\nperturbations has a cut-off on the scale of dwarf galaxies. Structure formation\ntherefore begins later than in the standard cold dark matter (CDM) model and\nvery few objects form below the cut-off mass scale. To calculate the number of\nionising photons, we use the Durham semi-analytic model of galaxy formation,\nGALFORM. We find that even the most extreme 7 keV sterile neutrino we consider\nis able to reionise the Universe early enough to be compatible with the bounds\non the epoch of reionisation from Planck. This, perhaps surprising, result\narises from the rapid build-up of high redshift galaxies in the sterile\nneutrino models which is also reflected in a faster evolution of their far-UV\nluminosity function between $10>z>7$ than in CDM. The dominant sources of\nionising photons are systematically more massive in the sterile neutrino models\nthan in CDM. As a consistency check on the models, we calculate the present-day\nluminosity function of satellites of Milky Way-like galaxies. When the\nsatellites recently discovered in the DES survey are taken into account, strong\nconstraints are placed on viable sterile neutrino models. \n\n"}

Direct searches for VULFs rely on low-energy precision measurement\ntools. While the previous proposals have focused on detecting coherent\noscillations of the VULF signals at the VULF Compton frequencies at individual\ndevices, here I consider a network of such devices. VULFs are essentially dark\nmatter {\\em waves} and as such they carry both temporal and spatial phase\ninformation. Thereby, the discovery reach can be improved by using networks of\nprecision measurement tools. To formalize this idea, I derive a spatio-temporal\ntwo-point correlation function for the ultralight dark matter fields in the\nframework of the standard halo model. Due to VULFs being Gaussian random\nfields, the derived two-point correlation function fully determines $N$-point\ncorrelation functions. For a network of $N_{d}$ devices within the coherence\nlength of the field, the sensitivity compared to a single device can be\nimproved by a factor of $\\sqrt{N_{d}}$. Further, I derive a VULF dark matter\nsignal profile for an individual device.

FOXSI is a rocket\nexperiment to perform high sensitivity HXR observations from 4-15 keV using the\nnew technique of HXR focusing optics. The focal plane detector requires < 100\num position resolution (to take advantage of the angular resolution of the\noptics) and about 1 keV energy resolution (FWHM) for spectroscopy down to 4\nkeV, with moderate cooling (> -30 C). Double-sided silicon strip detectors were\nused for the first FOXSI flight in 2012 to meet these criteria. To improve the\ndetectors' efficiency (66 at 15 keV for the silicon detectors) and position\nresolution of 75 um for the second launch, we fabricated double-sided CdTe\nstrip detectors with a position resolution of 60 um and almost 100 % efficiency\nfor the FOXSI energy range.

The period ratios fall in a range similar\nto double-mode fundamental and first overtone RR Lyrae stars (RRd), with the\nexception of one star, in which the period ratio is significantly lower and\nnearly exactly equals 0.7. Although period ratios are fairly different for the\nfour stars, the light curve shapes corresponding to the dominant, fundamental\nmode are very similar.

Motivated\nby the recent release of unprecedentedly deep and wide imaging data around the\nPal~5 stellar stream, we develop a new probabilistic, adaptive and\nnon-parametric technique which allows us to bring the cluster's tidal tails\ninto clear focus. Strikingly, we uncover a stream whose density exhibits\nvisible changes on a variety of angular scales.

The radially\ncooler populations form a strong bar, and are vertically thin and\npeanut-shaped, while the hotter populations form a weaker bar and become a\nvertically thicker box. We demonstrate that it is the radial, not the vertical,\nvelocity dispersion that dominates this evolution. Assuming that early stellar\ndiscs heat rapidly as they form, then both the in-plane and vertical random\nmotions correlate with stellar age and chemistry, leading to different density\ndistributions for metal-rich and metal-poor stars. We then use a\nhigh-resolution simulation, in which all stars form out of gas, to demonstrate\nthat this is what happens. When we apply these results to the Milky Way we show\nthat a very broad range of observed trends for ages, densities, kinematics and\nchemistries, that have been presented as evidence for contradictory paths to\nthe formation of the bulge, are in fact consistent with a bulge which formed\nfrom a continuum of disc stellar populations which were kinematically separated\nby the bar.

However, interpretation of these images is\ndifficult because the degree of polarization is highly sensitive to the angle\nof scattering of stellar light off the disk surface. We examine how disks with\nand without gaps created by planets appear in scattered polarized light as a\nfunction of inclination angle. Isophotes of inclined disks without gaps are\ndistorted in polarized light, giving the appearance that the disks are more\neccentric or more highly inclined than they truly are. Apparent gap locations\nare unaffected by polarization, but the gap contrast changes. In face-on disks\nwith gaps, we find that the brightened far edge of the gap scatters less\npolarized light than the rest of the disk, resulting in slightly decreased\ncontrast between the gap trough and the brightened far edge. In inclined disks,\ngaps can take on the appearance of being localized \"holes\" in brightness rather\nthan full axisymmetric structures.

We\nperform a suite of 3D MHD AMR simulations of AGN feedback in a cool core\ncluster including cosmic ray (CR) physics. CRs are supplied to the ICM via\ncollimated AGN jets and subsequently disperse in the magnetized ICM via\nstreaming, and interact with the ICM via hadronic, Coulomb, and streaming\ninstability heating. We find that CR transport is an essential model ingredient\nneeded for AGN feedback to self-regulate, at least within the context of the\nphysical model considered here. When CR streaming is neglected, the suppression\nof CR mixing with the ICM by magnetic fields significantly reduces ICM heating,\nwhich leads to cooling catastrophes. In the opposite case, CRs come into\ncontact with the ambient ICM and efficiently heat it, which results in globally\nstable atmospheres. Moreover, the dynamical state and intermittency of the\ncentral AGN are dramatically altered when CR streaming is present.

Magnetised stellar wind outflows are primarily responsible for\nthe loss of angular momentum from these objects during the main sequence.\nPrevious works have shown the reduced effectiveness of the stellar wind braking\nmechanism with increasingly complex, but singular, magnetic field geometries.\nIn this paper, we quantify the impact of mixed dipolar and quadrupolar fields\non the spin-down torque using 50 MHD simulations with mixed field, along with\n10 of each pure geometries.

Secondly, we derive and discuss a\ngeneral free-energy conservation law, which captures both the KRMHD free-energy\nconservation at long wavelengths and dual cascades of kinetic Alfven waves and\nion entropy at sub-ion-Larmor scales. We show that non-Maxwellian features in\nthe distribution function change the amount of phase mixing and the efficiency\nof magnetic stresses, and thus influence the partitioning of free energy\namongst the cascade channels. Thirdly, a simple model is used to show that\npressure anisotropy can cause large variations in the ion-to-electron heating\nratio due to the dissipation of Alfvenic turbulence. Our theory provides a\nfoundation for determining how pressure anisotropy affects the turbulent\nfluctuation spectra, the differential heating of particle species, and the\nratio of parallel and perpendicular phase mixing in space and astrophysical\nplasmas. \n\n"}

Here we will\ncharacterize the progenitor of the outbursting object, explore its environment,\nand analyse the temporal evolution of the eruption. We are particularly\ninterested in the physical origin of the two deep photometric dips, one\noccurred in 2012, and one is ongoing since 2016.

Beside analysing the color changes\nduring fading, we compiled multiepoch spectral energy distributions, and fitted\nthem with a simple accretion disk model. Based on pre-outburst data and a\nmillimeter continuum measurement, we suggest that the progenitor of the V582\nAur outburst is a low-mass T Tauri star with average properties.

It is well known that\ngravitational sedimentation can affect significantly the abundances of helium\nand heavy elements in the intracluster gas of massive galaxy clusters. The\nself-similarity of the temperature profiles and tight mass--temperature\nrelation of relaxed cool-core clusters suggest that the maximum effect of\nsedimentation take place in the most massive virialized objects in the\nUniverse. However, Chandra and XMM-Newton observations demonstrate more complex\nscaling relations between the masses of early-type galaxies and other\nparameters, such as the ISM temperature and gas mass fraction. An important\nfact is that early-type galaxies can show both decreasing and increasing radial\ntemperature profiles. We have calculated the diffusion based on the observed\ngas density and temperature distributions for 13 early-type galaxies that\nbelonging to the different environments and cover a wide range of X-ray\nluminosities.

Here we analytically\nand numerically investigate vertical tracer transport in a 3D stratified\natmosphere and predict $K_{zz}$ as a function of the large-scale circulation\nstrength, horizontal mixing due to eddies and waves and local tracer sources\nand sinks. We find that $K_{zz}$ increases with tracer chemical lifetime and\ncirculation strength but decreases with horizontal eddy mixing efficiency. We\ndemarcated three $K_{zz}$ regimes in planetary atmospheres. In the first regime\nwhere the tracer lifetime is short compared with the transport timescale and\nhorizontal tracer distribution under chemical equilibrium ($\\chi_0$) is\nuniformly distributed across the globe, global-mean vertical tracer mixing\nbehaves diffusively.

In this work, we highlight a more severe, previously\nunrecognized shortcoming of ES models: the large-scale 21 cm power spectrum\n(equivalently, HI bias b_HI) is a relatively strong function of the spatial\nresolution used to generate ES ionization maps. We trace this problem to the\nfact that photon non-conservation in these models arises from a\nresolution-dependent mixture of spatially resolved, photon non-conserving\nbubbles, and partially ionized grid cells which are perfectly photon-conserving\nby construction. We argue that this inevitably leads to a resolution-dependence\nof b_HI, with the correct, converged value only emerging at very coarse\nresolution.

Fossil clues Abstract: Early-type retired galaxies (RGs, i.e. galaxies which no longer form stars)\ncan be divided into two classes: those with no emission lines, here dubbed\nlineless RGs, and those with emission lines, dubbed liny RGs. Both types of\ngalaxies contain hot low-mass evolved stars (HOLMES) which emit ionizing\nphotons. The difference must thus lie in the presence or absence of a reservoir\nof ionizable gas. From a volume-limited sample of 38\\,038 elliptical galaxies,\nwe explore differences in physical properties between liny and lineless using\ndata from the SDSS, WISE and GALEX catalogues. To avoid biases in the\ncomparison, we pair-match liny and lineless in stellar-mass, redshift and\nhalf-light Petrosian radius. We detect marginal differences in their optical\nstellar ages and NUV luminosities, indicating that liny RGs have an excess of\nintermediate-age (0.1--5 Gyr) stellar populations. Liny RGs show higher dust\nattenuation and $W3$ luminosities than their lineless counterparts.

Relative\nmagnetic helicity can be decomposed uniquely into two gauge invariant\nquantities, the magnetic helicity of the non-potential component of the field,\nand a complementary volume-threading helicity. Recent analysis of numerical\nexperiments simulating the generation of solar eruptions have shown that the\nratio of the non-potential helicity to the total relative helicity is a clear\nmarker of the eruptivity of the magnetic system, and that the high value of\nthat quantity could be a sufficient condition for the onset of the instability\ngenerating the eruptions. The present study introduces the first analytical\nexamination of the time variations of these non-potential and volume-threading\nhelicities. The validity of the analytical formulas derived are confirmed with\nanalysis of three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations of\nsolar coronal dynamics.

Super--sonic turbulence fragments\nMCs into dense sheets, filaments and cores and large low density ``voids'', via\nthe action of highly radiative shocks. We refer to this process as \"turbulent\nfragmentation\". In this work we derive the mass distribution of gravitationally\nunstable cores generated by the process of turbulent fragmentation. The mass\ndistribution above one solar mass depends primarily on the power spectrum of\nthe turbulent flow and on the jump conditions for isothermal shocks in a\nmagnetized gas. For a power spectrum index \\beta=-1.74, consistent with\nLarson's velocity dispersion--size relation as well as with new numerical and\nanalytic results on super--sonic turbulence, we obtain a power law mass\ndistribution of dense cores with a slope equal to 3/(4-\\beta) = 1.33,\nconsistent with the slope of the stellar IMF. Below one solar mass, the mass\ndistribution flattens and turns around at a fraction of a solar mass, as\nobserved for the stellar IMF in a number of stellar clusters, because only the\ndensest cores are gravitationally unstable. The mass distribution at low masses\nis determined by the probability distribution of the gas density, which is\nknown to be approximately Log--Normal for an isothermal turbulent gas. The\nintermittent nature of the turbulent density distribution is thus responsible\nfor the existence of a significant number of small collapsing cores, even of\nsub--stellar mass. Since turbulent fragmentation is unavoidable in\nsuper--sonically turbulent molecular clouds, and given the success of the\npresent model in predicting the observed shape of the stellar IMF, we conclude\nthat turbulent fragmentation is essential to the origin of the stellar IMF. \n\n"}

Our study is based on near-IR\n(H-band: lambda = 1.65 micron) observations, for the first time comprising\nearly- and late-type systems. Our data confirm that the mean effective\ndynamical mass-to-light ratio M/L of the E+S0+S0a galaxies increases with\nincreasing effective dynamical mass M, as expected from the existence of the\nFundamental Plane relation. Conversely, spiral and Im/BCD galaxies show a broad\ndistribution in M/L with no detected trend of M/L with M, the former galaxies\nhaving M/L values about twice larger than the latter, on average. For all the\nlate-type galaxies, the M/L increases with decreasing effective surface\nintensity Ie, consistent with the existence of the Tully--Fisher relation.\nThese results are discussed on the basis of the assumptions behind the\nconstruction of the k-space and their limitations.

The low temperatures imply typical sizes of about 1\n(S_{850}/1mJy})^{1/2} arcsec, a factor two to three larger than those predicted\nusing starburst-like spectral energy distributions. Low dust temperatures also\nimply a ratio of optical/UV to 850-micron flux which is 30-100 times smaller,\nfor the same optical depth, than expected for objects with a hot,\nstarburst-like SED.

A simple model in which BL Lacs\nare the moderately beamed (gamma ~ 3) counterparts of radio galaxies, with some\nrandom dispersion (~ 0.4 decades) in the intrinsic radio-X-ray relationship,\ncan reproduce many of the features of the radio-selected and X-ray-selected BL\nLac samples, including their radio and X-ray luminosity functions and the\ndistributions of their radio-to-X-ray spectral indices.

We find that the SFR of galaxies is strongly\ncorrelated with the local (projected) galaxy density and thus we present here\nthe density-SFR relation that is analogous to the density-morphology relation.\nThe effect of density on the SFR of galaxies is seen in three ways. First, the\noverall distribution of SFRs is shifted to lower values in dense environments\ncompared with the field population. Second, the effect is most noticeable for\nthe strongly star-forming galaxies in the 75th percentile of the SFR\ndistribution. Third, there is a ``break'' (or characteristic density) in the\ndensity-SFR relation at a local galaxy density of 1h-2 Mpc-2. To understand\nthis break further, we have studied the SFR of galaxies as a function of\nclustercentric radius from 17 clusters and groups objectively selected from the\nSDSS EDR data. The distribution of SFRs of cluster galaxies begins to change,\ncompared with the field population, at a clustercentric radius of 3-4 virial\nradii, which is consistent with the characteristic break in density that we\nobserve in the density-SFR relation.

Spectral analysis reveals\nthe second case of a relativistic X-ray absorbing outflow in a BAL quasar. The\nfirst case was revealed in a recent observation of APM 08279+5255 with the\nChandra X-ray Observatory. The spectrum of PG1115+080 indicates the presence of\ncomplex low-energy absorption in the 0.2-0.6 keV observed energy band and\nhigh-energy absorption in the 2-5 keV observed energy band. The high-energy\nabsorption is best modeled by two Gaussian absorption lines with rest-frame\nenergies of 7.4 keV and 9.5 keV. Assuming that these two lines are produced by\nresonant absorption due to Fe xxv Kalpha, we infer that the X-ray absorbers are\noutflowing with velocities of ~0.10c and ~0.34c, respectively. We have detected\nsignificant variability of the energies and widths of the X-ray BALs in PG\n1115+080 and APM 08279+5255 over timescales of 19 and 1.8 weeks (proper-time),\nrespectively.

Abstract: Much recent discussion about dark matter has been centered on two seemingly\nindependent problems: the abundance of substructure in dark matter halos, and\nthe cuspiness of the halos' inner density profile. We explore possible\nconnections between the two problems by studying the gravitational scattering\neffects due to subhalos on the phase-space distribution of dark matter\nparticles in the main halos. Our series of controlled numerical experiments\nindicates that the number and mass density of subhalos can be high enough to\ncause the collisionless dark matter particles in the inner part of a main halo\nto diffuse, flattening the main halo's inner cusp within a few dynamical times.\nDepending on the masses and concentration of the subhalos, the inner density\nprofile of the whole system (main plus sub halos) can either steepen or\nflatten. Subhalo accretion can therefore introduce significant scatter in the\ninner density profiles of dark matter halos, offering a possible explanation\nfor the range of profiles seen in both observations and cosmological\nsimulations. \n\n"}

It has been argued that quasar lifetimes may therefore be\ninferred from their clustering length, which determines the typical mass of the\nquasar host. Here we point out that the relationship between the mass of the\nblack-hole and the circular velocity of its host dark-matter halo is more\nfundamental to the determination of the clustering length. In particular, the\nclustering length observed in the 2dF quasar redshift survey is consistent with\nthe galactic halo - black-hole relation observed in local galaxies, provided\nthat quasars shine at ~10-100% of their Eddington luminosity. The slow\nevolution of the clustering length with redshift inferred in the 2dF quasar\nsurvey favors a black-hole mass whose redshift-independent scaling is with halo\ncircular velocity, rather than halo mass. These results are independent from\nobservations of the number counts of bright quasars which may be used to\ndetermine the quasar lifetime and its dependence on redshift. We show that if\nquasar activity results from galaxy mergers, then the number counts of quasars\nimply an episodic quasar lifetime that is set by the dynamical time of the host\ngalaxy rather than by the Salpeter time.

Abstract: The formation of relativistic astrophysical jets is presumably mediated by\nmagnetic fields threading accretion disks and central, rapidly rotating\nobjects.

However, it is unclear how\nefficient is the conversion from magnetic to kinetic energy and whether there\nare any observational signatures of this process. We address this issue in the\ncontext of jets in quasars.

Our bubbles\nare inflated near the base of the ICM over a finite time interval from a region\nwhose magnetic field is isolated from the ICM. We confirm both the early\nconjecture from linear analysis and the later results based on preformed MHD\nbubbles; namely, that very modest ICM magnetic fields can stabilize the rising\nbubbles against disruption by Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstabilities. We find in addition that amplification of the ambient fields as\nthey stretch around the bubbles can be sufficient to protect the bubbles or\ntheir initial fragments even if the fields are initially much too weak to play\na significant role early in the evolution of the bubbles. Indeed, even with\ninitial fields less than a micro-Gauss and values of $\\beta = P_g/P_b$\napproaching $10^5$, magnetic stresses in our simulations eventually became\nlarge enough to influence the bubble evolution. Magnetic field influence also\ndepends significantly on the geometry of the ICM field and on the topology of\nthe field at the bubble/ICM interface. For example, reconnection of\nanti-parallel fields across the bubble top greatly reduced the ability of the\nmagnetic field to inhibit disruptive instabilities.

A model\n  for chemical enrichment Abstract: We discuss a model for treating chemical enrichment by SNII and SNIa\nexplosions in simulations of cosmological structure formation. Our model\nincludes metal-dependent radiative cooling and star formation in dense\ncollapsed gas clumps. Metals are returned into the diffuse interstellar medium\nby star particles using a local SPH smoothing kernel. A variety of chemical\nabundance patterns in enriched gas arise in our treatment owing to the\ndifferent yields and lifetimes of SNII and SNIa progenitor stars. In the case\nof SNII chemical production, we adopt metal-dependent yields. Because of the\nsensitive dependence of cooling rates on metallicity, enrichment of galactic\nhaloes with metals can in principle significantly alter subsequent gas infall\nand the build up of the stellar components. Indeed, in simulations of isolated\ngalaxies we find that a consistent treatment of metal-dependent cooling\nproduces 25% more stars outside the central region than simulations with a\nprimordial cooling function. In the highly-enriched central regions, the\nevolution of baryons is however not affected by metal cooling, because here the\ngas is always dense enough to cool. A similar situation is found in\ncosmological simulations because we include no strong feedback processes which\ncould spread metals over large distances and mix them into unenriched diffuse\ngas. We demonstrate this explicitly with test simulations which adopt\nsuper-solar cooling functions leading to large changes both in the stellar mass\nand in the metal distributions. We also find that the impact of metallicity on\nthe star formation histories of galaxies may depend on their particular\nevolutionary history. Our results hence emphasise the importance of feedback\nprocesses for interpreting the cosmic metal enrichment. \n\n"}

We show\nthat the extraordinarily luminous radio emission is well described by a\nself-absorption dominated synchrotron spectrum while the observed X-ray\nemission at t~30 days is adequately fit by Inverse Compton scattering of the\noptical photons off of the synchrotron emitting electrons. Our radio model\nimplies a sub-relativistic ejecta velocity, v ~ 0.24c, at t_0 ~ 10 days after\nthe explosion which emphasizes that broad optical absorption lines do not imply\nrelativistic ejecta.

To better judge on some of the\ncompeting scenarios, we present spectroscopic [Fe/H] estimates for a sample of\n26 compact objects in the central region of the Fornax cluster, covering the\nmagnitude range of UCDs and bright globular clusters. We find a break in the\nmetallicity distribution of compact objects at M_V ~ -11 mag (~3*10^6 M_sun):\nfor M_V<-11 mag the mean metallicity is [Fe/H]=-0.62 +/- 0.05 dex, 0.56 +/-\n0.15 dex higher than for M_V>-11 mag. This metallicity break is accompanied by\na change in the size-luminosity relation for compact objects, as deduced from\nHST-imaging: for M_V<-11 mag, r_h scales with luminosity, while for M_V>-11\nmag, r_h is almost luminosity-independent. We therefore assume a limiting\nabsolute magnitude of M_V=-11 mag between UCDs and globular clusters. The mean\nmetallicity of five Fornax dE,N nuclei included in our study is about 0.8 dex\nlower than that of the UCDs, at 4.5 sigma significance. Because of this large\nmetallicity discrepancy we disfavor the hypothesis that most of the Fornax UCDs\nare the remnant nuclei of tidally stripped dE,Ns. Our metallicity estimates for\nUCDs are closer to but slightly below those derived for young massive clusters\n(YMCs) of comparable masses. We therefore favor a scenario where most UCDs in\nFornax are successors of merged YMCs produced in the course of violent\ngalaxy-galaxy mergers. It is noted that in contrast to that, the properties of\nVirgo UCDs are more consistent with the stripping scenario, suggesting that\ndifferent UCD formation channels may dominate in either cluster. \n\n"}

We numerically\ninvestigate both the gas accretion rates (m_acc) onto super massive black holes\n(SMBHs) and the star formation rates (m_sf) in ULIRGs formed by gas-rich galaxy\nmergers and thereby discuss what powers ULIRGs. Our principal results, which\ncan be tested against observations, are as follows. (1) ULIRGs powered by AGN\ncan be formed by major merging between luminous, gas-rich disk galaxies with\nprominent bulges containing SMBHs, owing to the efficient gas fuelling m_acc >\n1 M_sun/yr of the SMBH. AGN in these ULIRGs can be surrounded by compact\npoststarburst stellar populations (e.g., A-type stars). (2) ULIRGs powered by\nstarbursts with m_sf ~ 100 M_sun/yr can be formed by merging between gas-rich\ndisk galaxies with small bulges having the bulge-to-disk-ratio (f_b) as small\nas 0.1. (3) The relative importance of starbursts and AGN can depend on\nphysical properties of merger progenitor disks, such as f_b, gas mass fraction,\nand total masses. For example, more massive galaxy mergers are more likely to\nbecome AGN-dominated ULIRGs. (4) For most models, major mergers can become\nULIRGs, powered either by starbursts or by AGN, only when the two bulges\nfinally merge. Interacting disk galaxies can become ULIRGs with well separated\ntwo cores (> 20kpc) at their pericenter when they are very massive and have\nsmall bulges. (5) Irrespective of the choice of model, interacting/merging\ngalaxies show the highest accretion rates onto the central SMBHs, and the\nresultant rapid growth of the SMBHs occur when their star formation rates are\nvery high. \n\n"}

{"id": "astro-ph/0608441", "contents": "Title: GRB060614 is at High Redshift, So No New Class of Gamma-Ray Bursts is\n  Required Abstract: Long duration Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) have been strongly connected with core\ncollapse supernovae, so it was surprising when the recent GRB060614 (with a\nreported redshift of 0.125) was found to have no visible supernova to deep\nlimits. Three separate groups have reached the same conclusion that this event\nforces the existence of a new previously-unsuspected class of GRBs. The problem\nwith this conclusion is that the redshift is not secure, as the measured galaxy\nemission lines simply give the redshift of the brightest galaxy near the\nline-of-sight to the GRB afterglow. Fortunately, eight different luminosity\nindicators are known which can give the luminosity (and hence redshift) of the\nGRB itself. In combination, these luminosity indicators have already proven to\ngive redshifts with average one-sigma errors of 26% as based on 69 GRBs with\nspectroscopic redshifts. For GRB060614, the luminosity indicators all uniformly\ngive a high luminosity for the burst which implies a high redshift. This can be\nseen by the spiky many-peaked light curve, the high E_{peak} value, the\nnear-zero spectral lag, and the timing of the jet break. Quantitatively, we\nderive a redshift of 1.97 (1.44<z<2.81 one-sigma) from the eight luminosity\nindicators. Additional information from the detection of the afterglow in all\nSwift UVOT bands further constrains the redshift to be <1.71, so the final\nrange of allowed redshift is 1.44<z<1.71, which readily explains why no\nsupernova was visible. Thus, GRB060614 is at high redshift and is certainly not\nevidence for a new class of GRBs. \n\n"}

We present improved orbital period measurements for HL Aqr (Porb = 3.254\n+- 0.001 h) and V380 Oph (Porb = 3.69857 +- 0.00002 h). BO Cet and V380 Oph\nexhibit emission-line flaring with periodicities of 20 min and 47 min,\nrespectively. The Halpha line of HL Aqr shows significant blueshifted\nabsorption modulated at the orbital period. Similarly to the emission S-wave of\nthe high-inclination SW Sex stars, this absorption S-wave has its maximum blue\nvelocity at orbital phase ~0.5. We estimate an orbital inclination for HL Aqr\nin the range 19 < i < 27 deg, which is much lower than that of the\nemission-dominated, non-eclipsing SW Sex stars (i ~ 60-70 deg). This gives rise\nto the interesting possibility of many low-inclination nova-likes actually\nbeing SW Sex stars, but with a very different spectroscopic appearance as they\nshow significant absorption. The increasing blueshifted absorption with\ndecreasing inclination points to the existence of a mass outflow with\nsignificant vertical motion. This six new additions to the SW Sex class\nincrease the presence of non-eclipsing systems to about one third of the whole\nSW Sex population, which therefore makes the requirement of eclipses as a\ndefining criterion for SW Sex membership no longer valid. The statistics of the\ncataclysmic variable population in the vicinity of the upper period gap is also\ndiscussed. \n\n"}

It is concluded that the sharp increase of the plasma\ntemperature by two orders of magnitude is related to a self-induced opacity\nwith respect to Alfven waves. The maximal frequency for propagation of Alfven\nwaves is determined by the strongly temperature dependent kinematic viscosity.\nIn such a way the temperature jump is due to absorption of high frequency\nAlfven waves in a narrow layer above the solar surface. It is calculated that\nthe power per unit area dissipated in this layer due to damping of Alfven waves\nblows up the plasma and gives birth to the solar wind. A model short\nwave-length (WKB) evaluation takes into account the 1/f^2 frequency dependance\nof the transversal magnetic field and velocity spectral densities. Such\nspectral densities agree with old magnetometric data taken by Voyager 1 and\nrecent theoretical calculations in the framework of Langevin-Burgers MHD.

The entire period can be\ndivided into 3 distinct phases: (1) transition from the hard to soft state, (2)\nsoft state, and (3) transition from the soft state back to the hard state. The\nobserved X-ray properties in phases 1 and 3 are remarkably similar, suggesting\nthat the same physical processes are likely involved in triggering such\ntransitions. The power density spectrum (PDS) during the transition can be\ncharacterized by a red noise component, followed by a white noise component\nwhich extends to roughly 1-3 Hz where it is cut off, and a steeper power law at\nhigher frequencies. The X-ray flux also exhibits apparent quasi-periodic\noscillation (QPO) with the centroid frequency varying in the range of 4-12 Hz.\nThe QPO shows no correlation with the source flux, but becomes more prominent\nat higher energies. This type of PDS bears resemblance to that of other black\nhole candidates often observed in a so-called very high state, although the\norigin of the observed QPO may be very different. The low-frequency red noise\nhas not been observed in the hard state, thus seems to be positively correlated\nwith the disk mass accretion rate which is presumably low in the hard state and\nhigh in the soft state; in fact, it completely dominates the PDS in the soft\nstate. In the framework of thermalComptonization models, Cui et al. (see\nastro-ph/9610071 and astro-ph/9610072) speculated that the difference in the\nobserved spectral and timing properties between the hard and soft states is due\nto the presence of a ``fluctuating'' Comptonizing corona during the transition.\nHere we present the measured hard X-ray time lags and coherence functions\nbetween various energy bands, and show that the results strongly support such a\nscenario. \n\n"}

I propose that this\ncorrelation results from dust formation above magnetic cool spots. The model\ndeals with elliptical PNs, but not with bipolar PNs. The basic assumption is\nthat a weak dynamo amplifies magnetic fields in AGB stars, such that magnetic\ncool spots are formed, mainly near the equatorial plane. Enhanced dust\nformation above these cool spots leads to a higher mass loss rate in the\nequatorial plane, resulting in the formation of an elliptical PN. The dust\nformation above cool spots becomes much more efficient when mass loss rate is\nhigh. In addition to explaining the correlation, the model has the advantage\nthat it can operate for very slowly rotating AGB stars, having rotation\nvelocities of less than $10^{-4}$ times the break-up velocity. Such velocities\ncan be achieved by a planet companion of mass $\\sim 0.1 M_{\\rm Jupiter}$ which\nspins-up the envelope, or even from singly evolved stars which leave the main\nsequence with a high rotation velocity. The sporadic nature of magnetic cool\nspots also leads to the formation of filaments, arcs, and clumps in the\ndescendant PN.

We assume a flat Friedmann background but\ninclude the cosmological constant. We ignore the rotational perturbation which\ndecays in expanding phase. In our previous studies we discovered that, to the\nsecond-order perturbation, except for the gravitational wave contributions, the\nrelativistic equations coincide exactly with the previously known Newtonian\nones. Since the Newtonian second-order equations are fully nonlinear, any\nnonvanishing third and higher order terms in the relativistic analyses are\nsupposed to be pure relativistic corrections. In this work we derive such\ncorrection terms appearing in the third order. Continuing our success in the\nsecond-order perturbations we take the comoving gauge. We discover that the\nthird-order correction terms are of $\\phi_v$-order higher than the second-order\nterms where $\\phi_v$ is a gauge-invariant combination related to the\nthree-space curvature perturbation in the comoving gauge; compared with the\nNewtonian potential we have $\\delta \\Phi \\sim {3 \\over 5} \\phi_v$ to the linear\norder.

Abstract: If the Pioneer anomaly has a gravitational origin, it would, according to the\nequivalence principle, distort the motions of the planets in the Solar System.\nSince no anomalous motion of the planets has been detected, it is generally\nbelieved that the Pioneer anomaly can not originate from a gravitational source\nin the Solar System. However, this conclusion becomes less obvious when\nconsidering models that either imply modifications to gravity at long range or\ngravitational sources localized to the outer Solar System, given the\nuncertainty in the orbital parameters of the outer planets. Following the\ngeneral assumption that the Pioneer spacecraft move geodesically in a\nspherically symmetric spacetime metric, we derive the metric disturbance that\nis needed in order to account for the Pioneer anomaly. We then analyze the\nresidual effects on the astronomical observables of the three outer planets\nthat would arise from this metric disturbance, given an arbitrary metric theory\nof gravity. Providing a method for comparing the computed residuals with actual\nresiduals, our results imply that the presence of a perturbation to the\ngravitational field necessary to induce the Pioneer anomaly is in conflict with\navailable data for the planets Uranus and Pluto, but not for Neptune.
