We use this to obtain results on the topology of\nthe moduli space ${\\cal B}_a(E)$ of (non-necessarily irreducible) oriented\nconnections, and to study the Donaldson $\\mu$-classes globally around the\nreduction loci. In this part of the article we use essentially the concept of\nharmonic section in a sphere bundle with respect to an Euclidean connection.\n  Second, we concentrate on moduli spaces of instantons on definite 4-manifolds\nwith arbitrary first Betti number. We prove strong generic regularity results\nwhich imply (for bundles with \"odd\" first Chern class) the existence of a\nconnected, dense open set of \"good\" metrics for which all the reductions in the\nUhlenbeck compactification of the moduli space are simultaneously regular.\nThese results can be used to define new Donaldson type invariants for definite\n4-manifolds. The idea behind this construction is to notice that, for a good\nmetric $g$, the geometry of the instanton moduli spaces around the reduction\nloci is always the same, independently of the choice of $g$. The connectedness\nof the space of good metrics is important, in order to prove that no\nwall-crossing phenomena (jumps of invariants) occur. Moreover, we notice that,\nfor low instanton numbers, the corresponding moduli spaces are a priori compact\nand contain no reductions at all so, in these cases, the existence of\nwell-defined Donaldson type invariants is obvious. The natural question is to\ndecide whether these new Donaldson type invariants yield essentially new\ndifferential topological information on the base manifold have, or have a\npurely topological nature. \n\n"}

The\nmachinery of BGG sequences also singles out a subclass of solutions called\nnormal solutions. These correspond to parallel tractor fields and hence to\n(certain) holonomy reductions of the canonical normal Cartan connection. Using\nthe normal Cartan connection, we define a special class of local frames for any\nnatural vector bundle associated to a parabolic geometry. We then prove that\nthe coefficient functions of any normal solution of a first BGG operator with\nrespect to such a frame are polynomials in the normal coordinates of the\nparabolic geometry. A bound on the degree of these polynomials in terms of\nrepresentation theory data is derived. For geometries locally isomorphic to the\nhomogeneous model of the geometry we explicitly compute the local frames\nmentioned above.

Poincare-Hopf tells\nthat for any injective function f on V the sum of i(f,x) is X(G). We also know\nthat averaging the indices E[i(f,x)] over all functions gives curvature K(x).\n  We explore here the situation when G is geometric of dimension d: that is if\neach unit sphere S(x) is geometric of dimension d-1 and that X(S(x))=0 for even\nd and X(S(x))=2 for odd d. The dimension of G is inductively defined as the\naverage of 1+dim(S(x)) over all S(x) assuming the empty graph has dimension -1.\n  We prove that any odd dimensional geometric graph G has zero curvature. This\nis done with the help of an index formula j(f,x) = 1-X(S(x))/2-X(B(f,x))/2,\nwhere j(x)=[i(f,x)+i(-f,x)]/2. The graph B(f,x) is the discrete level surface\n{y | f(y) = f(x)} intersected with S(x).

For odd d it becomes\nj(f,x) =-X(B(f,x))/2, where B(f,x) is an odd dimensional graph.

However, it is still not\nwell-understood; for example, existence of solutions to the conformal equations\nfor zero or negative Yamabe metrics is still unknown without the so-called\n``CMC'' or ``near-CMC'' assumptions.

However, their results are\nbased on topological arguments, and as a result solution uniqueness is not\nknown. Indeed, Maxwell gave evidence in 2011 that far-from-CMC solutions are\nnot unique in certain cases. In this article, we provide further insight by\nestablishing a type of alternative theorem for general far-from-CMC solutions.\nFor a given manifold M that admits a metric of positive scalar curvature and\nscalar flat metric g(0) with no conformal Killing fields, we first prove\nexistence of an analytic, one-parameter family of metrics g(z) through g(0)\nsuch that R(g(z)) = z.

In this paper we investigate conditions under which\nevolving a smooth rotationally symmetric sphere by a linear combination of its\nradii of curvature yields a Hopf sphere. When the coefficients of the flow have\ncertain integer values, the fate of an initial sphere is entirely determined by\nthe local geometry of its isolated umbilic points. A surprising variety of\nbehaviours is uncovered: convergence to round spheres and non-round Hopf\nspheres, as well as divergence to infinity.\n  The critical quantity is the rate of vanishing of the astigmatism - the\ndifference of the radii of curvature - at the isolated umbilic points. It is\nproven that the size of this quantity versus the coefficient in the flow\nfunction determines the fate of the evolution.\n  The geometric setting for the equation is Radius of Curvature space, viewed\nas a pair of hyperbolic/AdS half-planes joined along their boundary, the\numbilic horizon. A rotationally symmetric sphere determines a parameterized\ncurve in this plane with end-points on the umbilic horizon. The slope of the\ncurve at the umbilic horizon is linked by the Codazzi-Mainardi equations to the\nrate of vanishing of astigmatism, and for generic initial conditions can be\nused to determine the outcome of the flow.\n  The slope can jump during the flow, and a number of examples are given:\ninstant jumps of the initial slope, as well as umbilic circles that contract to\npoints in finite time and 'pop' the slope. Finally, we present soliton-like\nsolutions: curves that evolve under linear flows by mutual hyperbolic/AdS\nisometries (dilation and translation) of Radius of Curvature space.

Here we have formulated a field\ntheoretic perturbation theory that incorporates two-body fields (both of\ndensity-density correlation field and its dual field playing the role of\ntwo-body interaction potential) into a density functional integral\nrepresentation of the Helmholtz free energy. Quadratic density fluctuations are\nonly considered in the saddle-point approximation of two-body fields as well as\ndensity field. We have obtained a set of self-consistent field equations with\nrespect to these fields, which simply reads a modified mean-field equation of\ndensity field where the bare interaction potential in the thermal energy unit\nis replaced by minus the direct correlation function given in the mean\nspherical approximation.

For spacetimes with\nRicci-flat conformal boundary, the convexity condition is associated with\nnegative mass. The second theorem is a uniqueness theorem for the negative mass\nAdS soliton spacetime. This result lends support to the new positive mass\nconjecture due to Horowitz and Myers which states that the unique lowest mass\nsolution which asymptotes to the AdS soliton is the soliton itself.

Instead of a base manifold S^3, we consider here a base manifold\nof dimension $n\\ge 2$ with a boundary and use Dirichlet boundary conditions on\nconnections as defined by Marini.

We then address the question of\ngeneralizing this concept to a Finsler space, where the metric tensor field\ncomes from a regular Lagrangian function $E$, homogeneous of degree two in the\nfibre coordinates on $TQ$. It is shown that when a symmetric type (1,1) tensor\nfield $K$ along the tangent bundle projection $\\tau: TQ\\to Q$ satisfies a\ndifferential condition which is similar to the defining relation of special\nconformal Killing tensors, there exists a direct recursive scheme again for\nfirst integrals of the geodesic spray.

Third, a Delaunay-like handle can be attached to a generalized Clifford\ntorus of the same mean curvature.

This shows that the open Toda lattice\ncannot be locally represented as a product of two bihamiltonian structures.\n  In a generic point the bihamiltonian periodic Toda lattice is shown to be\nisomorphic to a product of two open Toda lattices (one of which is a (trivial)\nstructure of dimension 1).\n  While the above results might be obtained by more traditional methods, we use\nan approach based on general results on geometry of webs.
