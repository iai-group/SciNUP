Based on dynamical arguments, we show gas primarily\nloses angular momentum to internal torques in a merger. Gas within some\ncharacteristic radius (a function of the orbital parameters, mass ratio, and\ngas fraction of the merging galaxies), will quickly lose angular momentum to\nthe stars sharing the perturbed disk, fall to the center and be consumed in a\nstarburst. A similar analysis predicts where violent relaxation of the stellar\ndisks is efficient. Our model allows us to predict the stellar and gas content\nthat will survive to re-form a disk in the remnant, versus being violently\nrelaxed or contributing to a starburst. We test this in hydrodynamic\nsimulations and find good agreement as a function of mass ratio, orbital\nparameters, and gas fraction, in simulations spanning a wide range in these\nproperties and others, including different prescriptions for gas physics and\nfeedback. In an immediate sense, the amount of disk that re-forms can be\nunderstood in terms of well-understood gravitational physics, independent of\ndetails of ISM gas physics or feedback. This allows us to explicitly quantify\nthe requirements for such feedback to (indirectly) enable disk survival, by\nchanging the pre-merger gas content and distribution.

The\nmonitorability of an omega-regular language, L, is thus a property that holds,\nif for any finite word u, observed so far, it is possible to add another finite\nword v, such that uv becomes a \"finite witness\" wrt.

Further, we establish new relationships of language classes\naccepted by LRAs and by ERAs with the Chomsky hierarchy. The main results\ninclude the following : (i) the class of languages accepted by lambda-LRAs\nforms an AFL with additional closure properties, (ii) any recursively\nenumerable language can be expressed as a homomorphic image of a language\naccepted by an LRA, (iii) the class of languages accepted by ERAs coincides\nwith the class of context-sensitive languages. \n\n"}

In this paper,\nwe show that if we use architecturally restricted verifiers instead of\nrestricting the working memory, i.e. replacing the working tape(s) with a\nsingle counter, we can define some IPS's for each decidable language. Such\nverifiers are called two-way probabilistic one-counter automata (2pca's). Then,\nwe show that by adding a fixed-size quantum memory to a 2pca, called a two-way\none-counter automaton with quantum and classical states (2qcca), the protocol\ncan be space efficient. As a further result, if the 2qcca can use a quantum\ncounter instead of a classical one, then the protocol can even be public, also\nknown as Arthur-Merlin games.\n  We also investigate the computational power of 2pca's and 2qcca's as language\nrecognizers.

Many solutions to this problem\nhave been proposed, including restricting the type of weights used and\nemploying a different valuation function that forces convergence. In this paper\nwe describe an alternative approach that, rather than seeking to avoid the\ninevitable divergences, instead embraces them as a source of useful\ninformation. Specifically, rather than taking coefficients from an arbitrary\nsemiring S we instead take them from S^N. Doing this is useful because it gives\nus information about how the weight of an infinite word does or does not\ndiverge, and if it does diverge what form the divergence takes --- e.g.,\npolynomial, exponential, etc. This approach has proved to be incredibly useful\nin the field of quantum simulation because when studying infinite systems,\ninformation about how quantities of interest, such as energy or magnetization,\ndiverge is exactly what we want.\n  In this paper we introduce a new kind of automaton which we call a diverging\nautomaton that maps infinite words to sequences of weights from a semiring and\nwhich employs a Buchi-like boundary condition. We then develop a theory for\ndiverging power series and prove a Kleene Theorem connecting rational diverging\npower series to diverging automata. Afterward we repeat this process by\nintroducing bidiverging automata which map biinfinite words to elements in S^(Z\nx N), developing a theory for bidiverging power series, and proving another\nKleene Theorem.

As a natural restriction of NP-reducibility, we introduce a notion\nof many-one CFL reducibility and conduct a ground work to formulate a coherent\nframework for further expositions. Two more powerful reducibilities--bounded\ntruth-table and Turing CFL-reducibilities--are also discussed in comparison.\nThe Turing CFL-reducibility, in particular, helps us introduce an exquisite\nhierarchy, called the CFL hierarchy, built over the family CFL of context-free\nlanguages. For each level of this hierarchy, its basic structural properties\nare proven and three alternative characterizations are presented. The second\nlevel is not included in NC(2) unless NP= NC(2). The first and second levels of\nthe hierarchy are different. The rest of the hierarchy (more strongly, the\nBoolean hierarchy built over each level of the hierarchy) is also infinite\nunless the polynomial hierarchy over NP collapses. This follows from a\ncharacterization of the Boolean hierarchy over the k-th level of the polynomial\nhierarchy in terms of the Boolean hierarchy over the k+1st level of the CFL\nhierarchy using log-space many-one reductions. Similarly, the complexity class\nTheta(k) is related to the closure of the k-th level of the CFL hierarchy under\nlog-space truth-table reductions. We also argue that the CFL hierarchy\ncoincides with a hierarchy over CFL built by application of many-one\nCFL-reductions. We show that BPCFL--a bounded-error probabilistic version of\nCFL--is not included in CFL even in the presence of advice. Employing a known\ncircuit lower bound and a switching lemma, we exhibit a relativized world where\nBPCFL is not located within the second level of the CFL hierarchy. \n\n"}

On the other hand, stochastic models like\nMarkov decision processes represent situations where the system is faced to a\npurely randomized environment: the aim is then to optimize the expected payoff,\nwith no guarantee on individual outcomes. We introduce the beyond worst-case\nsynthesis problem, which is to construct strategies that guarantee some\nquantitative requirement in the worst-case while providing an higher expected\nvalue against a particular stochastic model of the environment given as input.\nThis problem is relevant to produce system controllers that provide nice\nexpected performance in the everyday situation while ensuring a strict (but\nrelaxed) performance threshold even in the event of very bad (while unlikely)\ncircumstances.

In particular, we study complete unitary\nsemigroups which have a special structure, and we show that each maximal\nunitary semigroup is complete. For $n \\ge 4$ there exists a complete unitary\nsemigroup that is larger than any aperiodic semigroup known to date.\n  We then present even larger aperiodic semigroups, generated by\ntransformations that map a non-empty subset of states to a single state; we\ncall such transformations and semigroups semiconstant. In particular, we\nexamine semiconstant tree semigroups which have a structure based on full\nbinary trees.

In wireless NCS the\ncommunication between sensors, controllers, and actuators is supported by a\ncommunication channel that is likely to introduce variable communication\ndelays, packet losses, limited bandwidth, and other practical non-idealities\nleading to numerous technical challenges. Although stability properties of NCS\nhave been investigated extensively in the literature, results for NCS under\nmore complex and general objectives, and in particular results dealing with\nverification or controller synthesis for logical specifications, are much more\nlimited.

Using helioseismology measurements of the internal rotation and\nmeridional circulation, we investigate a mean-field MHD model of dynamo\ndistributed in the bulk of the convection zone but shaped in a near-surface\nlayer. We show that if the boundary conditions at the top of the dynamo region\nallow the large-scale toroidal magnetic fields to penetrate into the surface,\nthen the dynamo wave propagates along the isosurface of angular velocity in the\nsubsurface shear layer, forming the butterfly diagram in agreement with the\nParker-Yoshimura rule and solar-cycle observations.

Correctness of an\nimplementation object is defined in terms of a corresponding abstract\nspecification. This gives rise to two important verification questions:\nmembership (checking whether a behaviour of the implementation is allowed by\nthe specification) and correctness (checking whether all behaviours of the\nimplementation are allowed by the specification). In this paper, we show that\nthe membership problem for quiescent consistency is NP-complete and that the\ncorrectness problem is decidable, but coNP-hard and in EXPSPACE. For both\nproblems, we consider restricted versions of quiescent consistency by assuming\nan upper limit on the number of events between two quiescent points. Here, we\nshow that the membership problem is in PTIME, whereas correctness is in PSPACE.\n  Quiescent consistency does not guarantee sequential consistency, i.e., it\nallows operation calls by the same process to be reordered when mapping to an\nabstract specification. Therefore, we also consider quiescent sequential\nconsistency, which strengthens quiescent consistency with an additional\nsequential consistency condition. We show that the unrestricted versions of\nmembership and correctness are NP-complete and undecidable, respectively. When\nby placing a limit on the number of events between two quiescent points,\nmembership is in PTIME, while correctness is in PSPACE.

Examples of complex specifications of interest include\nproperties expressed as formulae in linear temporal logic (LTL) or as automata\non infinite strings. A general methodology to synthesize controllers for such\nproperties resorts to symbolic abstractions of the given stochastic systems.\nSymbolic models are discrete abstractions of the given concrete systems with\nthe property that a controller designed on the abstraction can be refined (or\nimplemented) into a controller on the original system. Although the recent\ndevelopment of techniques for the construction of symbolic models has been\nquite encouraging, the general goal of formal synthesis over stochastic control\nsystems is by no means solved.

Here we analyse the\ncomplex radio structure of 3C 293 winged source hosted by the post-merger\ngalaxy, which uniquely displays a significant asymmetry between the sizes of\nthe two pairs of lobes, indicating that an episode of jet realignment took\nplace only very recently. Based on all the available radio data for 3C 293, we\nhave performed a detailed spectral modelling for the older and younger lobes in\nthe system. In this way we derived the lobes' ages and jet energetics, which we\nthen compared to the accretion power in the source. We found that the 200\nkpc-scale outer lobes of 3C 293 are ~60 Myr old and that jet activity related\nto the formation of the outer lobes ceased within the last Myr. Meanwhile, the\ninner 4 kpc-scale lobes, tilted by ~40 deg with respect to the outer ones, are\nonly about ~0.3 Myr old. The best model fits also return identical values of\nthe jet power supplying the outer and the inner structures. This power is of\nthe order of the maximum kinetic luminosity of a Blandford-Znajek jet for a\ngiven black hole mass and accretion rate, but only in the case of relatively\nlow values of a black hole spin, a~0.2. The derived jet energetics and\ntimescales, along with the presence of two optical nuclei in 3C 293, all\nprovide a strong support to the Lense-Thirring precession model in which the\nsupermassive black hole spin, and therefore the jet axis, flips rapidly owing\nto the interactions with the tilted accretion disk in a new tidal interaction\nepisode of the merging process. We further speculate that, in general, X-shape\nradio morphology forms in post-merger systems that are rich in cold molecular\ngas, and only host slowly spinning supermassive black holes. \n\n"}

In this study we first introduce a new model of dynamics on a\nsymbolic space, the versatile shift, showing that it supports the real-time\nsimulation of a range of automata. We then show that the Goedelization of\nversatile shifts defines nonlinear dynamical automata, dynamical systems\nevolving on a vectorial space.

We believe that this method can also be used to tackle other\nlong-standing problems in computational geometry, in relation for instance with\nself-avoiding paths. Tile assembly (including non-cooperative tile assembly)\nwas originally introduced by Winfree and Rothemund in STOC 2000 to understand\nhow to program shapes. The non-cooperative variant, also known as temperature 1\ntile assembly, is the model where tiles are allowed to bind as soon as they\nmatch on one side, whereas in cooperative tile assembly, some tiles need to\nmatch on several sides in order to bind. Previously, exactly one known result\n(SODA 2014) showed a restriction on the assemblies general non-cooperative\nself-assembly could achieve, without any implication on its computational\nexpressiveness. With non-square tiles (like polyominos, SODA 2015), other\nrecent works have shown that the model quickly becomes computationally\npowerful. \n\n"}

If the newly added component conforms to the assumption, then the\nwhole system still satisfies the property.

We\nconsider several versions of this problem, corresponding to different semantics\nof RPQs that have recently been considered: arbitrary paths, shortest paths,\nsimple paths, and trails. Whereas arbitrary and shortest paths can be\nenumerated in polynomial delay, the situation is much more intricate for simple\npaths and trails.

This field has been\ntraditionally approached from a practical point of view, resulting in\nheterogeneous implementations with fundamentally different capabilities. The\nmain reason behind this is that defining formal semantics for a CER language is\nnot trivial: they usually combine first-order variables for joining and\nfiltering events with regular operators like sequencing and Kleene closure.\nMoreover, their semantics usually focus only on the detection of complex\nevents, leaving the concept of output mostly unattended.\n  In this paper, we propose to unify the semantics and output of complex event\nrecognition languages by using second order objects. Specifically, we introduce\na CER language called Second Order Complex Event Logic (SO-CEL for short), that\nuses second order variables for managing and outputting sequences of events.\nThis makes the definition of the main CER operators simple, allowing us to\ndevelop the first steps in understanding its expressive power. We start by\ncomparing SO-CEL with a version that uses first-order variables called FO-CEL,\nshowing that they are equivalent in expressive power when restricted to unary\npredicates but, surprisingly, incomparable in general. Nevertheless, we show\nthat if we restrict to sets of binary predicates, then SO-CEL is strictly more\nexpressive than FO-CEL. Then, we introduce a natural computational model called\nUnary Complex Event Automata (UCEA) that provides a better understanding of\nSO-CEL. We show that, under unary predicates, SO-CEL captures the subclass of\nUCEA that satisfy the so-called *-property. Finally, we identify the operations\nthat SO-CEL is lacking to capture UCEA and introduce a natural extension of the\nlanguage that captures the complete class of UCEA under unary predicates. \n\n"}

The central algorithmic problem for Petri nets is\nreachability: whether from the given initial configuration there exists a\nsequence of valid execution steps that reaches the given final configuration.\nThe complexity of the problem has remained unsettled since the 1960s, and it is\none of the most prominent open questions in the theory of verification.\nDecidability was proved by Mayr in his seminal STOC 1981 work, and the\ncurrently best published upper bound is non-primitive recursive Ackermannian of\nLeroux and Schmitz from LICS 2019. We establish a non-elementary lower bound,\ni.e. that the reachability problem needs a tower of exponentials of time and\nspace.

Firstly, it shows that the reachability problem is much harder than\nthe coverability (i.e., state reachability) problem, which is also ubiquitous\nbut has been known to be complete for exponential space since the late 1970s.\nSecondly, it implies that a plethora of problems from formal languages, logic,\nconcurrent systems, process calculi and other areas, that are known to admit\nreductions from the Petri nets reachability problem, are also not elementary.\nThirdly, it makes obsolete the currently best lower bounds for the reachability\nproblems for two key extensions of Petri nets: with branching and with a\npushdown stack. \n\n"}

We show these conditions\nare expressive since they are satisfied by a multitude of string operations.\nThey also strictly subsume existing decidable string theories, and most\nexisting benchmarks (e.g. most of Kaluza's, and all of SLOG's, Stranger's, and\nSLOTH's). We give a simple decision procedure and an extensible architecture of\na string solver in that a user may easily incorporate his/her own string\nfunctions.

Formal\nsynthesis methods derived from symbolic systems have great potential for\nreasoning about high-level locomotion decisions and achieving complex\nmaneuvering behaviors with correctness guarantees. This study takes a first\nstep toward formally devising an architecture composed of task planning and\ncontrol of whole-body dynamic locomotion behaviors in constrained and\ndynamically changing environments. At the high level, we formulate a two-player\ntemporal logic game between the multi-limb locomotion planner and its dynamic\nenvironment to synthesize a winning strategy that delivers symbolic locomotion\nactions. These locomotion actions satisfy the desired high-level task\nspecifications expressed in a fragment of temporal logic. Those actions are\nsent to a robust finite transition system that synthesizes a locomotion\ncontroller that fulfills state reachability constraints. This controller is\nfurther executed via a low-level motion planner that generates feasible\nlocomotion trajectories. We construct a set of dynamic locomotion models for\nlegged robots to serve as a template library for handling diverse environmental\nevents.

By a theorem of McNaughton and Papert, these are\nalso the first-order definable languages. The dot-depth rose to prominence\nfollowing the work of Thomas, who proved an exact correspondence with the\nquantifier alternation hierarchy of first-order logic: each level in the\ndot-depth hierarchy consists of all languages that can be defined with a\nprescribed number of quantifier blocks. One of the most famous open problems in\nautomata theory is to settle whether the membership problem is decidable for\neach level: is it possible to decide whether an input regular language belongs\nto this level?\n  Despite a significant research effort, membership by itself has only been\nsolved for low levels. A recent breakthrough was achieved by replacing\nmembership with a more general problem: separation. Given two input languages,\none has to decide whether there exists a third language in the investigated\nlevel containing the first language and disjoint from the second. The\nmotivation is that: (1) while more difficult, separation is more rewarding (2)\nit provides a more convenient framework (3) all recent membership algorithms\nare reductions to separation for lower levels.\n  We present a separation algorithm for dot-depth two. While this is our most\nprominent application, our result is more general. We consider a family of\nhierarchies that includes the dot-depth: concatenation hierarchies. They are\nbuilt via a generic construction process. One first chooses an initial class,\nthe basis, which is the lowest level in the hierarchy. Further levels are built\nby applying generic operations. Our main theorem states that for any\nconcatenation hierarchy whose basis is finite, separation is decidable for\nlevel one. In the special case of the dot-depth, this can be lifted to level\ntwo using previously known results. \n\n"}
