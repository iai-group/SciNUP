This screening effect is attributed to the highly degenerate\nconfigurations of the frustrated environment. This slow relaxation is due to an\nentropy effect and is different from those due to the energy barrier observed\nin systems such as random ferromagnets. In the present system, even if there is\nno energy gap, the slow relaxation still takes place. Thus, we call this\nphenomenon ``entropic slowing down''. Here, we study the mechanism of entropic\nslowing down quantitatively in an Ising spin model with the so-called decorated\nbonds. The spins included in decorated bonds (decoration spins) cause a\npeculiar density of states, which causes on entropy-induced screening effect.\nWe analytically estimate the time scale of the system that increases\nexponentially with the number of decoration spins. We demonstrate the scaling\nof relaxation processes using the time scale at all temperatures including the\ncritical point. \n\n"}

The first presents an overview of known\nresults in statistical mechanics of disordered systems and its approach to\nrandom combinatorial optimization problems. The second part is a discussion of\ntwo original results.\n  The first result concerns DPLL heuristics for random k-XORSAT, which is\nequivalent to the diluted Ising p-spin model. It is well known that DPLL is\nunable to find the ground states in the clustered phase of the problem, i.e.\nthat it leads to contradictions with probability 1. However, no solid argument\nsupports this is general. A class of heuristics, which includes the well known\nUC and GUC, is introduced and studied. It is shown that any heuristic in this\nclass must fail if the clause to variable ratio is larger than some constant,\nwhich depends on the heuristic but is always smaller than the clustering\nthreshold.\n  The second result concerns the properties of random k-SAT at large clause to\nvariable ratios. In this regime, it is well known that the uniform distribution\nof random instances is dominated by unsatisfiable instances. A general\ntechnique (based on the Replica method) to restrict the distribution to\nsatisfiable instances with uniform weight is introduced, and is used to\ncharacterize their solutions.

Apart from the off-diagonal correlations which depends on the\nso-called Jordan-Wigner string, real-space observables are similar for\nfree-fermions and hard-core bosons on a chain. Interestingly, by coupling only\ntwo chains, thus forming a two-leg ladder, particle exchange becomes allowed,\nand leads to a totally different physics between free-fermions and hard-core\nbosons. Using a combination of analytical (strong coupling, field theory,\nrenormalization group) and numerical (quantum Monte Carlo, density-matrix\nrenormalization group) approaches, we study the apparently simple but\nnon-trivial model of hard-core bosons hopping in a two-leg ladder geometry. At\nhalf-filling, while a band insulator appears for fermions at large interchain\nhopping tperp >2t only, a Mott gap opens up for bosons as soon as tperp\\neq0\nthrough a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition.

The authors purport that any bidirectional network with\none-dimensional intrinsic node dynamics can be fully controlled by a single\ndriver node, which can be any node in the network, regardless of the network\ntopology. According to this result, a network with an arbitrarily large number\nof nodes (a million, a billion, or even more) could be controlled by a single\nnode. Here we show, however, that this result is specious and that it does not\nhold true even for networks with only two nodes. We demonstrate that the\nerroneous results are a consequence of a fundamental flaw in the proposed\nmethod, namely, that reaching a local desired state using the proposed\nlinearization procedure generally requires a nonlocal trajectory, which grossly\nviolates the linear approximation. Their further conclusion that network\nsystems with nonlinear dynamics are more controllable than those with linear\ndynamics is a known fact presented as novel based on a flawed argument.

Despite the importance of this quantity in classifying liquids,\nexplaining what aspects of the microscopic structure controls fragility remains\na challenge.

This marginal stability has traditionally been understood in\nterms of isostaticity, the equality of the number of mechanical contacts and\nthe number of degrees of freedom. Quasicontacts, pairs of spheres on the verge\nof coming in contact, are irrelevant for static stability, but they come into\nplay when considering dynamic stability, as does the distribution of contact\nforces. We show that the effects of marginal dynamic stability, as manifested\nin the distributions of quasicontacts and weak contacts, are consequential and\nnontrivial. We study these ideas first in the context of MRJ packing of\nd-dimensional spheres, where we show that the abundance of quasicontacts grows\nat a faster rate than that of contacts. We reexamine a calculation of Jin et\nal. (Phys. Rev.

But the onion spectrum reveals much more information about a\nnetwork, and at multiple scales; for example, it can be used to quantify node\nheterogeneity, degree correlations, centrality, and tree- or lattice-likeness\nof the whole network as well as of each k-core. Furthermore, unlike the k-core\ndecomposition, the combined degree-onion spectrum immediately gives a clear\nlocal picture of the network around each node which allows the detection of\ninteresting subgraphs whose topological structure differs from the global\nnetwork organization. This local description can also be leveraged to easily\ngenerate samples from the ensemble of networks with a given joint degree-onion\ndistribution. We demonstrate the utility of the onion spectrum for\nunderstanding both static and dynamic properties on several standard graph\nmodels and on many real-world networks. \n\n"}

In fact,\nrandom $K$-SAT, with $\\alpha=M/N $ as control parameter, can be solved quickly\nfor small enough values of $\\alpha$. It shows a phase transition between a\nsatisfiable phase and an unsatisfiable phase. For branch and bound algorithms,\nwhich operate in the space of feasible Boolean configurations, the empirically\nhardest problems are located only close to this phase transition. Here we study\n$K$-SAT ($K=3,4$) and the related optimization problem MAX-SAT by a linear\nprogramming approach, which is widely used for practical problems and allows\nfor polynomial run time. In contrast to branch and bound it operates outside\nthe space of feasible configurations. On the other hand, finding a solution\nwithin polynomial time is not guaranteed. We investigated several variants like\nincluding artificial objective functions, so called cutting-plane approaches,\nand a mapping to the NP-complete vertex-cover problem.

Starting from\na random initial node, a random walker hops randomly along directed edges\nbetween adjacent nodes in the network. The path terminates either by the\nretracing scenario, when the walker enters a node which it has already visited\nbefore, or by the trapping scenario, when it becomes trapped in a dead-end node\nfrom which it cannot exit. The path length, namely the number of steps, $d$,\npursued by the random walker from the initial node up to its termination, is\ncalled the first hitting time. Using recursion equations, we obtain analytical\nresults for the tail distribution of first hitting times, $P(d>\\ell)$. The\ndistribution $P(d>\\ell)$ can be expressed as a product of an exponential\ndistribution and a Rayleigh distribution. We obtain expressions for the mean,\nmedian and standard deviation of this distribution in terms of the network size\nand its mean degree. We also calculate the distribution of last hitting times,\nnamely the path lengths of self-avoiding walks on directed ER networks, which\ndo not retrace their paths.

Hence this allows to\naccess the temperature range around T_c of the so-called mode coupling theory,\nwhereas the dynamics around the experimental glass transition is completely out\nof reach. While methods such as ``parallel tempering'' improve the situation\nsomewhat, a method that allows to span a significant part of the region T_g\\leq\nT\\leq T_c is still lacking. Only for abstract models such as the infinite range\n10-state Potts glass with a few hundred spins this region can be explored.\nHowever this model suffers from very strong finite size effects thus making it\ndifficult to extrapolate the results obtained for the finite system sizes to\nthe thermodynamic limit. For the case of polymer melts, two different\nstrategies to use lattice models instead of continuum models are discussed: In\nthe first approach, a mapping of an atomistically realistic model of\npolyethylene to the bond fluctuation model with suitable effective potentials\nand a temperature-dependent time rescaling factor is attempted.

We examine this bias\nanalytically and experimentally. For Erdos-Renyi random graphs with mean degree\nc, we show analytically that traceroute sampling gives an observed degree\ndistribution P(k) ~ 1/k for k < c, even though the underlying degree\ndistribution is Poisson. For graphs whose degree distributions have power-law\ntails P(k) ~ k^-alpha, traceroute sampling from a small number of sources can\nsignificantly underestimate the value of \\alpha when the graph has a large\nexcess (i.e., many more edges than vertices).

The analysis of these experiments results in the\nconclusion that the effect seems to be related to the nuclear degrees of\nfreedom of tunneling systems. The interactions of a nuclear quadrupole\nelectrical moment with the crystal field and of a nuclear magnetic moment with\nmagnetic field transform the two-level tunneling systems inherent in amorphous\ndielectrics into many-level tunneling systems.

Previous field theoretical treatment\nviolated this symmetry, whereas others pointed out that constructing symmetry\npreserving perturbation theories is a crucial and open issue. In this work we\nsolve this problem and then apply our results to the mode-coupling theory of\nthe glass transition (MCT). We show that in the context of dynamical field\ntheories for glass-forming liquids TRS is expressed as a nonlinear field\ntransformation that leaves the action invariant. Because of this nonlinearity,\nstandard perturbation theories generically do not preserve TRS and in\nparticular FDRs. We show how one can cure this problem and set up\nsymmetry-preserving perturbation theories by introducing some auxiliary fields.\nAs an outcome we obtain Schwinger-Dyson dynamical equations that automatically\npreserve FDRs and that serve as a basis for carrying out symmetry-preserving\napproximations.

We present two types of models.\nThe first is the Communicating Walkers model, a hybrid model composed of both\ncontinuous fields and discrete entities - walkers, which are coarse-graining of\nthe bacteria. Models of the second type are systems of reaction diffusion\nequations, where the branching of the pattern is due to non-constant diffusion\ncoefficient of the bacterial field. The diffusion coefficient represents the\neffect of self-generated lubrication fluid on the bacterial movement. We\nimplement the discreteness of the biological system by introducing a cutoff in\nthe growth term at low bacterial densities. We demonstrate that the cutoff does\nnot improve the models in any way.
