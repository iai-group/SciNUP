Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on\nthe role that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in\nglobular clusters, e.g., influencing the distribution of horizontal branch\nstars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of some globular clusters, and in\nforming low mass white dwarfs. \n\n"}

The aim of this study is to understand\nthe evolution timescale of circumstellar debris discs, and the physical\nmechanisms responsible for such evolution around solar-type stars. In addition,\nwe perform a detailed characterisation of the detected debris discs.\nTheoretically, the mass of the disc is expected to decrease with time. In order\nto test this hypothesis, we performed the generalised Kendall's tau correlation\nand three different two-sample tests. A characterisation of the detected debris\ndiscs has been obtained by computing the collision and Poynting-Robertson\ntimescales and by modelling the spectral energy distribution. The Kendall's tau\ncorrelation yields a probability of 76% that the mass of debris discs and their\nage are correlated. Similarly, the three two-sample tests give a probability\nbetween 70 and 83% that younger and older debris systems belong to different\nparent populations in terms of dust mass.

For two X-ray luminous clusters at redshift z ~ 0.3 with opposite\nX-ray morphologies, RXCJ0014.3-3022 and RXCJ2308.3-0211, we assess differences\nin galaxy populations as a function of cluster topography. Cluster large-scale\nstructure and substructure are determined from the combined photometry in the\nB, V, and R bands, and from multi-object optical spectroscopy at low\nresolution. A spectral index analysis is performed, based on the [OII] and\nHdelta features, and the D4000 break, available for more than 100 member\ngalaxies per cluster. Combination of spectral indices and FUV-optical colours\nprovides a picture of the star formation history in galaxies. In spite of the\npotential presence of a small fraction of galaxies with obscured star formation\nactivity, the average star-formation history of cluster members is found to\ndepend on cluster-centric distance and on substructure.

We identify significant\nsystematic effects in this procedure that can artificially induce an additional\ndiffuse component with a morphology strikingly similar to the claimed gamma-ray\nhaze. To quantitatively illustrate this point we calculate sky-maps of the\nratio of the gamma-ray emission from neutral pions to the ISM column density,\nand of IC to synchrotron emission, using detailed galactic cosmic-ray models\nand simulations. In the region above and below the galactic center, the ISM\ntemplate underestimates the gamma-ray emission due to neutral pion decay by\napproximately 20%. Additionally, the synchrotron template tends to\nunder-estimate the IC emission at low energies (few GeV) and to over-estimate\nit at higher energies (tens of GeV) by potentially large factors that depend\ncrucially on the assumed magnetic field structure of the Galaxy.

This measurement,\ncombined with the width of the nebular-phase OI6303-6363A line, can be used to\nplace an upper-limit on the progenitor main-sequence mass. Using the results\nfrom our simulations, we find that the current, but remarkably scant, late-time\nspectra of Type II-P SNe support progenitor main-sequence masses inferior to\n~20Msun and thus, corroborate the inferences based on the direct, but\ndifficult, progenitor identification in pre-explosion images. The narrow width\nof OI6303-6363A in Type II-P SNe with nebular spectra does not support\nhigh-mass progenitors in the range 25-30Msun. Combined with quantitative\nspectroscopic modelling, such diagnostics offer a means to constrain the\nmain-sequence mass of the progenitor, the mass fraction of the core ejected,\nand thus, the mass of the compact remnant formed. \n\n"}

How does this accord with the use of single\nparticle distribution functions in the kinetic equations? When can these\neffects be parametrised in an effective description in terms of quasiparticles?\nAnd what is the kinematic role of their thermal masses? We address these\nquestions in the framework of nonequilibrium quantum field theory and develop\nan intuitive picture in which contributions from higher order processes are\nparametrised by the widths of resonances in the plasma. In the narrow width\nlimit we recover the quasiparticle picture, with the additional processes\ngiving rise to off-shell parts of quasiparticle propagators that appear to\nviolate energy conservation. In this regime we give analytic expressions for\nthe scalar and fermion nonequilibrium propagators in a medium.

First, hard nucleon-nucleon elastic scattering was studied\nconsidering the quark exchange (QE) between the nucleons to be the dominant\nmechanism of interaction in the constituent picture. It was found that an\nangular asymmetry exhibited by proton-neutron (pn) elastic scattering data is\nexplained within this framework if a quark-diquark picture dominates the\nnucleon's structure instead of a more traditional SU(6) model. The latter\nyields an asymmetry around 90 deg center of mass scattering with a sign\nopposite to what is experimentally observed. The second process is the hard\nbreakup by a photon of a nucleon-nucleon system in light nuclei.

Here, we\ncalculate the signature of an initial state modification in single-field\nslow-roll inflation in both the scale-dependent bias of the large-scale\nstructure (LSS) and mu-type distortion in the black-body spectrum of the cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB). We parametrize the initial state modifications and\nidentify certain choices of parameters as natural, though we also note some\nfine-tuned choices that can yield a larger bispectrum. In both cases, we\nobserve a distinctive k^-3 signature in LSS (as opposed to k^-2 for the\nlocal-form). As a non-zero bispectrum in the squeezed configuration correlates\na long-wavelength mode with two short-wavelength modes, it induces a\ncorrelation between the CMB temperature anisotropy on large scales with the\ntemperature-anisotropy-squared on very small scales; this correlation persists\nas the small-scale anisotropy-squared is processed into mu-type distortions.\nWhile the local-form mu-distortion turns out to be too small to detect in the\nnear future, a modified initial vacuum state enhances the signal by a large\nfactor owing to an extra factor of k_1/k. For example, a proposed\nabsolutely-calibrated experiment, PIXIE, is expected to detect this correlation\nwith a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 10, for an occupation number of about\n0.5 in the observable modes.

The sample\nincludes galaxies both on and above the main sequence (MS) traced by\nstar-forming galaxies in the SFR-M* plane. The far-infrared data are used to\nderive dust masses, Mdust. Combined with an empirical prescription for the\ndependence of the gas-to-dust ratio on metallicity (GDR), the CO luminosities\nand Mdust values are used to derive for each galaxy the CO-to-H2 conversion\nfactor, alpha_co.

The same\nelectrons in the presence of microgauss-scale magnetic fields can also generate\nthe the observed microwave \"haze\". At lower latitudes (b < 20 degrees), in\ncontrast, the spectrum of the emission correlated with the Bubbles possesses a\npronounced spectral feature peaking at 1-4 GeV (in E^2 dN/dE) which cannot be\ngenerated by any realistic spectrum of electrons. Instead, we conclude that a\nsecond (non-inverse-Compton) emission mechanism must be responsible for the\nbulk of the low-energy, low-latitude emission. This second component is\nspectrally similar to the excess GeV emission previously reported from the\nGalactic Center (GC), and also appears spatially consistent with a luminosity\nper volume falling approximately as r^-2.4, where r is the distance from the\nGC. We argue that the spectral feature visible in the low-latitude Bubbles is\nthe extended counterpart of the GC excess, now detected out to at least 2-3 kpc\nfrom the GC.

Such a regime is, for example, applicable to compact\nbinaries coalescing, where characteristic velocities can reach fifty percent\nthe speed of light and compactnesses can reach a half. This review begins with\nthe theoretical basis and the predicted gravitational wave observables of\nmodified gravity theories. The review continues with a brief description of the\ndetectors, including both gravitational wave interferometers and pulsar timing\narrays, leading to a discussion of the data analysis formalism that is\napplicable for such tests. The review ends with a discussion of gravitational\nwave tests for compact binary systems. \n\n"}

They form in dense cores of molecular clouds that are observed to be\nsignificantly magnetized. Our previous study shows that magnetic braking can\ntighten the binary separation during the protostellar mass accretion phase by\nremoving the angular momentum of the accreting material. Recent numerical\ncalculations of single star formation have shown that misalignment between the\nmagnetic field and rotation axis may weaken both magnetic braking and the\nassociated magnetically driven outflows. These two effects allow for disk\nformation even in strongly magnetized cores. Here we investigate the effects of\nmagnetic field misalignment on the properties of protobinaries. Somewhat\nsurprisingly, the misaligned magnetic field is more efficient at tightening the\nbinary orbit compared to the aligned field. The main reason is that the\nmisalignment weakens the magnetically-driven outflow, which allows more\nmaterial to accrete onto the binary. Even though the specific angular momentum\nof this inner material is higher than in the aligned case, it is insufficient\nto compensate for the additional mass. A corollary of this result is that a\nweaker field is required to achieve the same degree of inward migration when\nthe field is tilted relative to the rotation axis. Large field misalignment\nalso helps to produce rotationally-supported circumbinary disks even for\nrelatively strong magnetic fields, by weakening the magnetically-dominated\nstructure close to the binary.

Most importantly,\nthe mean standardized brightness for SNe Ia with local H\\alpha\\ emission is\n0.094+/-0.031 mag fainter than for those without. This offset arises from a\nbimodal structure in the Hubble residuals, that also explains the\npreviously-known host-mass bias. We combine this bimodality with the cosmic\nstar-formation rate to predict changes with redshift in the mean SN Ia\nbrightness and the host-mass bias. This change is confirmed using high-redshift\nSNe Ia from the literature. These environmental dependences point to remaining\nsystematic errors in SNe Ia standardization. The observed brightness offset is\npredicted to cause a significant bias in measurements of the dark energy\nequation of state. Recognition of these effects offers new opportunities to\nimprove SNe Ia as cosmological probes - e.g. SNe Ia having local H\\alpha\\\nemission are more homogeneous, having a brightness dispersion of 0.105+/-0.012\nmag. \n\n"}

The most natural\nexplanation of this coincidence is that both the neutrino excess and the\nultra-high energy, $>10^{19}$ eV, cosmic-ray (UHECR) flux are produced by the\nsame population of cosmologically distributed sources, producing CRs, likely\nprotons, at a similar rate, $E^2 dQ/dE=0.5\\times10^{44}(erg/Mpc^3yr)$ (at z=0),\nacross a wide range of energies, from $10^{15}$ eV to $>10^{20}$ eV, and\nresiding in environments (such as starburst galaxies) in which CRs of rigidity\n$E/Z< 10^{17}$ eV lose much of their energy to pion production. Identification\nof the neutrino sources will allow one to identify the UHECR accelerators, to\nresolve open questions related to the accelerator models, and to study neutrino\nproperties (related e.g. to flavor oscillations and coupling to gravity) with\nan accuracy many orders of magnitude better than is currently possible. The\nmost promising method for identifying the sources is by association of a\nneutrino with an electromagnetic signal accompanying a transient event\nresponsible for its generation. The neutrino flux that is produced within the\nsources, and that may thus be directly associated with transient events, may be\nsignificantly lower than the total observed neutrino flux, which may be\ndominated by neutrino production at the environment in which the sources\nreside. \n\n"}

Our observational campaign aims to better understand\nand describe the multiwavelength data, the physical properties of the system\ncomponents, and the short- and long-term behavior of the component fluxes in RS\nCae. We employ stellar atmosphere, stratified accretion-column, and widely used\nX-ray spectral models.

Our XMM-Newton data of RS Cae are clearly dominated by soft X-ray\nemission. The X-ray light curves are shaped by emission from the main accretion\nregion, which is visible over the whole orbital cycle, interrupted only by a\nstream eclipse. The optical light curves are formed by cyclotron and stream\nemission. The XMM-Newton X-ray spectra comprise a black-body-like and a plasma\ncomponent at mean temperatures of 36eV and 7keV. The spectral fits give\nevidence of a partially absorbing and a reflection component.

Abstract: Recently the commissioning APOGEE observations of the Galactic bulge reported\nthat a significant fraction of stars ($\\sim10%$) are in a cold ($\\sigma_{\\rm V}\n\\approx 30$ km/s) high velocity peak (Galactocentric radial velocity $\\approx\n200$ km/s). These stars are speculated to reflect the stellar orbits in the\nGalactic bar. In this study, we use two $N$-body models of the Milky Way-like\ndisk galaxy with different bar strengths to critically examine this\npossibility. The general trends of the Galactocentric radial velocity\ndistribution in observations and simulations are similar, but neither our\nmodels nor the BRAVA data reveal a statistically significant cold high velocity\npeak. A Monte Carlo test further suggests that it is possible for a spurious\nhigh velocity peak to appear if there are only a limited number of stars\nobserved. Thus, the reported cold high velocity peak, even if it is real, is\nunlikely due to stars on the bar-supporting orbits. Our models do predict an\nexcess of stars with high radial velocity, but not in a distinct peak. In the\ndistance--velocity diagram, the high velocity particles in different fields\nexist at a similar distance $\\sim8.5 \\pm 1$ kpc away from the Sun. This result\nmay be explained with geometric intersections between the line-of-sight and the\nparticle orbits; high velocity stars naturally exist approximately at the\ntangent point, without constituting a distinct peak. We further demonstrate\nthat even without the presence of a bar structure, particle motions in an\naxisymmetric disk can also exhibit an excess of high velocity stars. \n\n"}

J1000+0221S shows high ionization\nconditions, as evidenced by its enhanced [OIII]/[OII] and [OIII]/Hbeta ratios.\nConsistently, strong-line methods based on the available line ratios suggest\nthat J1000+0221S is an extremely metal-poor galaxy, with a metallicity of\n12+log(O/H) < 7.44 (< 5% solar), placing it among the most metal-poor\nstar-forming galaxies at z > 3 discovered so far. In combination with its low\nstellar mass (2x10^8 Msun) and high star formation rate (5 Msun/yr), the\nmetallicity of J1000+0221S is consistent with the extrapolation to low masses\nof the mass-metallicity relation traced by Lyman-break galaxies at z > 3, but\nit is 0.55 dex lower than predicted by the fundamental metallicity relation at\nz < 2.5. These observations suggest the picture of a rapidly growing galaxy,\npossibly fed by the massive accretion of pristine gas. Additionally, deep\nLBT/LBC in the UGR bands are used to derive a limit to the LyC escape fraction,\nthus allowing us to explore for the first time the regime of sub-L* galaxies at\nz > 3. We find a 1sigma upper limit to the escape fraction of 23%, which adds a\nnew observational constraint to recent theoretical models predicting that\nsub-L* galaxies at high-z have high escape fractions and thus are the\nresponsible for the reioization of the Universe. \n\n"}

We therefore try to clarify the status of this issue with a full\nforecast of two stage-IV surveys using a new approach to properly account for\ncovariance between the different probes in the overlapping samples.

However, the common surface\ndensity at dwarf-galaxy scales, for which we have derived from the Milky Way\nand Andromeda dwarf satellites, is reproduced only in a massive range of WDM\nparticle masses, whereas CDM provides a reasonable agreement with the observed\nconstancy. This is due to the striking difference between mass-concentration\nrelations for CDM and WDM halos at low halo-mass scales. In order to explain\nthe universal surface density of dwarf-galaxy scales in WDM models, we suggest\nthat WDM particles need to be heavier than 3 keV. \n\n"}

This approach offers significant\nadvantages over commonly employed second order finite volume (FV) solvers. In\nparticular, the higher order capability renders it computationally more\nefficient, in the sense that the same precision can be obtained at\nsignificantly less computational cost.

Vector gravitational field is coupled to matter\nuniversally and minimally through the equivalent metric $f_{ik}$ which is a\nfunctional of $A_k$.

For cosmology our theory predicts the same evolution of\nthe Universe as general relativity with cosmological constant and zero spatial\ncurvature. However, the present theory provides explanation of the dark energy\nas energy of longitudinal gravitational field induced by the Universe expansion\nand yields, with no free parameters, the value of $\\Omega _{\\Lambda\n}=2/3\\approx 0.67$ which agrees with the recent Planck result $\\Omega _{\\Lambda\n}=0.686\\pm 0.02$.

In the presence of external pressure,\nthe pressure gradient set up within a self-gravitating isothermal cloud leads\nto a non-uniform density distribution. Thus the local environment of a cloud\ninfluences its internal structure. In the simple equilibrium model, the\nfraction of gas at high density in the cloud interior is determined simply by\nthe cloud surface density, which is itself inherited from the pressure in the\nimmediate surroundings. This idea is tested using measurements of the\nproperties of local clouds, which are found to show remarkable agreement with\nthe simple equilibrium model.

Illustris galaxies display similar relations to those observed.\nUtilizing our knowledge of simulated formation histories, and leveraging the\nlarge simulation volume, we construct galaxy samples of satellites and centrals\nthat are matched in formation histories. This allows us to find that ~1/3 of\nthe metallicity-environment correlation is due to different formation histories\nin different environments. This is a combined effect of satellites (in\nparticular, in denser environments) having on average lower z=0 star formation\nrates (SFRs), and of their older stellar ages, even at a given z=0 SFR. Most of\nthe difference, ~2/3, however, is caused by the higher concentration of\nstar-forming disks of satellite galaxies, as this biases their SFR-weighted\nmetallicities toward their inner, more metal-rich parts. With a newly defined\nquantity, the 'radially averaged' metallicity, which captures the metallicity\nprofile but is independent of the SFR profile, the metallicities of satellites\nand centrals become environmentally independent once they are matched in\nformation history. We find that circumgalactic metallicity (defined as rapidly\ninflowing gas around the virial radius), while sensitive to environment, has no\nmeasurable effect on the metallicity of the star-forming gas inside the\ngalaxies. \n\n"}

In particular, electrons and positrons from dark\nmatter annihilation produce synchrotron radiation in the presence of magnetic\nfields. Galaxy clusters are the most massive collapsed structures in the\nuniverse, and are known to host $\\sim\\mu$G-scale magnetic fields. They are\ntherefore ideal targets to search for, or to constrain the synchrotron signal\nfrom dark matter annihilation. In this work we use the expected sensitivities\nof several planned surveys from the next generation of radio telescopes to\npredict the constraints on dark matter annihilation models which will be\nachieved in the case of non-detections of diffuse radio emission from galaxy\nclusters.

Such models also provide a robust testing ground for the\nso-called stable clustering approximation, which gives simple predictions for\nthem. Studying large N-body simulations of such models with different force\nsmoothing, we find that these two issues are in fact very closely related: our\nconclusion is that the accuracy of two point statistics in the non-linear\nregime starts to degrade strongly around the scale at which their behaviour\ndeviates from that predicted by the stable clustering hypothesis. Physically\nthe association of the two scales is in fact simple to understand: stable\nclustering fails to be a good approximation when there are strong interactions\nof structures (in particular merging) and it is precisely such non-linear\nprocesses which are sensitive to fluctuations at the smaller scales affected by\ndiscretisation.

We found that (i) after shock wave crossing, the most\ncontribution of $\\Delta \\phi_{FC}$ for energetic GRBs (in order GeV and larger)\ncomes from GRB-CMB interactions, however for low energy GRBs the contributions\nof the Compton scattering of GRBs in the galaxy cluster magnetic field\ndominate; (ii) in shock wave crossing, the magnetic filed has significant\neffects on converting GRB's linear polarization to circular one, this effect\ncan be used to better understanding magnetic profile in shock wave. The main\naim of this work is a emphasis that the studying and measuring the circular\npolarization of GRBs are helpful for better understanding of physics and\nmechanism of the generation of GRBs and their interactions before reaching us. \n\n"}

This clustering translates into a\nvery large population of subhalos in galaxies and affects the predictions for\ndirect and indirect dark matter searches (gamma rays and antimatter cosmic\nrays). In this paper, we elaborate on previous analytic works to model the\nGalactic subhalo population, while consistently with current observational\ndynamical constraints on the Milky Way. In particular, we propose a\nself-consistent method to account for tidal effects induced by both dark matter\nand baryons. Our model does not strongly rely on cosmological simulations as\nthey can hardly be fully matched to the real Milky Way, but for setting the\ninitial subhalo mass fraction. Still, it allows to recover the main qualitative\nfeatures of simulated systems. It can further be easily adapted to any change\nin the dynamical constraints, and be used to make predictions or derive\nconstraints on dark matter candidates from indirect or direct searches. We\ncompute the annihilation boost factor, including the subhalo-halo\ncross-product. We confirm that tidal effects induced by the baryonic components\nof the Galaxy play a very important role, resulting in a local average subhalo\nmass density $\\lesssim 1\\%$ of the total local dark matter mass density, while\nselecting in the most concentrated objects and leading to interesting features\nin the overall annihilation profile in the case of a sharp subhalo mass\nfunction.

Short bars of sub-kiloparsec radius have been hypothesized\nto be an important mechanism for driving gas inflows to small scale, feeding\ncentral BHs. In order to quantify the maximum BH mass allowed by this\nmechanism, we examine the robustness of short bars to the dynamical influence\nof BHs. Large-scale bars are expected to be robust, long-lived structures;\nextremely massive BHs, which are rare, are needed to completely destroy such\nbars. However, we find that short bars, which are generally embedded in\nlarge-scale outer bars, can be destroyed quickly when BHs of mass $M_{\\rm\nbh}\\sim0.05-0.2\\%$ of the total stellar mass ($M_\\star$) are present. In\nagreement with this prediction, all galaxies observed to host short bars have\nBHs with a mass fraction less than $0.2\\%M_\\star$. Thus the dissolution of\nshort inner bars is possible, perhaps even frequent, in the universe. An\nimportant implication of this result is that inner bar-driven gas inflows may\nbe terminated when BHs grow to $\\sim0.1\\%M_\\star$. We predict that\n$0.2\\%M_\\star$ is the maximum mass of BHs allowed if they are fed predominately\nvia inner bars. This value matches well the maximum ratio of BH-to-host galaxy\nstellar mass observed in galaxies with pseudo-bulges and most nearby AGN host\ngalaxies. This hypothesis provides a novel explanation for the lower $M_{\\rm\nbh}/M_\\star$ in galaxies which have avoided significant mergers compared with\ngalaxies with classical bulges. \n\n"}

As a consequence, most of the formed PBHs\nare rapidly rotating near the extreme value $a_{*}=1$, where $a_{*}$ is the\nnondimensional Kerr parameter at their formation. The smaller the density\nfluctuation $\\sigma_{H}$ at horizon entry is, the stronger the tendency towards\nthe extreme rotation.

These datasets were compared to $\\Lambda$CDM\npredictions based on recent mass function, adapted to account for the effects\nof massive neutrinos. Treating the clusters mass calibration as a free\nparameter, we examined whether the data favours neutrino masses appreciably\nhigher than the minimal 0.06 eV value. Using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods,\nwe found no significant correlation between the mass calibration of clusters\nand the sum of neutrino masses, meaning that massive neutrinos do not\nnoticeably alleviate the above-mentioned Planck CMB--clusters tension.

We show that this assumption is incorrect when the energy is injected\nin the form of energetic (i.e. energy much greater than the background CMB\ntemperature) particles.

The electromagnetic shower loses a substantial fraction of\nits energy to the CMB spectral distortions before the energy of the particles\nin the shower has degraded to low enough energies that they can thermalize with\nthe background plasma. This spectral distortion is the result of the\ninteraction of non-thermal energetic electrons in the shower with the CMB and\nthus has a shape that is substantially different from the $y$-type or $i$-type\ndistortions.

Giant impacts are expected to play a role in the\nformation of many of these worlds. Previous works, focused on the mechanical\nshock caused by a giant impact, have shown that these impacts can eject large\nfractions of the planetary envelope, offering a partial explanation for the\nobserved spread in exoplanet compositions. Here, we examine the thermal\nconsequences of giant impacts, and show that the atmospheric loss caused by\nthese effects can significantly exceed that caused by mechanical shocks for\nhydrogen-helium (H/He) envelopes. When a giant impact occurs, part of the\nimpact energy is converted into thermal energy, heating the rocky core and the\nenvelope. We find that the ensuing thermal expansion of the envelope can lead\nto a period of sustained, rapid mass loss through a Parker wind, resulting in\nthe partial or complete erosion of the H/He envelope. The fraction of the\nenvelope lost depends on the planet's orbital distance from its host star and\nits initial thermal state, and hence age. Planets closer to their host stars\nare more susceptible to thermal atmospheric loss triggered by impacts than ones\non wider orbits. Similarly, younger planets, with rocky cores which are still\nhot and molten from formation, suffer greater atmospheric loss. This is\nespecially interesting because giant impacts are expected to occur\n$10{-}100~\\mathrm{Myr}$ after formation. For planets where the thermal energy\nof the core is much greater than the envelope energy, the impactor mass\nrequired for significant atmospheric removal is $M_\\mathrm{imp} / M_p \\sim \\mu\n/ \\mu_c \\sim 0.1$, approximately the ratio of the heat capacities of the\nenvelope and core. When the envelope energy dominates the total energy budget,\ncomplete loss can occur when the impactor mass is comparable to the envelope\nmass. \n\n"}

To put the\nestimates of the latter on a firmer footing, we first derive analytical PBH\nmerger rate for general PBH mass functions while imposing a minimal initial\ncomoving distance between the binary and the PBH nearest to it, in order to\npick only initial configurations where the binary would not get disrupted. We\nthen study the formation and evolution of PBH binaries before recombination by\nperforming N-body simulations. We find that the analytical estimate based on\nthe tidally perturbed 2-body system strongly overestimates the present merger\nrate when PBHs comprise all dark matter, as most initial binaries are disrupted\nby the surrounding PBHs. This is mostly due to the formation of compact N-body\nsystems at matter-radiation equality.

To understand their observational signatures,\nwe simulate these white dwarf (WD) postgenitors from shortly after explosion\nuntil they move back down the WD cooling track, and we consider several\npossible WD masses and explosion energies.

Abstract: VLT spectra of 14 luminous compact galaxies (LCGs) reveal strong metallic\nabsorption line sytems as well as narrow and intense emission lines. Their gas\nextinction is found to be large (Av ~ 1.5 mag) leading to an upward revision of\ntheir star formation rate (SFR) to an average value of ~ 40 Mo/yr. Large\nextinction values are also supported by the large rate of detection in one\nfield observed by ISO. Gas metal abundances in LCGs have about half the solar\nvalue. We argue that LCGs are the progenitors of present-day spiral bulges.\nLCGs have masses and light concentrations similar to those of present-day\nbulges. As in present-day galactic bulges, LCG stars show a wide range of\nabundances. Thus, observing LCGs allows us to directly witness an important\nstage in the formation of a massive galaxy, the building of the bulge prior to\nthat of the disk. The gas needed to feed the observed star formation is likely\nto be falling in from the outskirts of the galaxy, being tidally pulled out\nfrom interacting companion galaxies. Some LCGs also show evidence for the\nbeginning of a disk formation. If the above scenario holds for most LCGs, we\nestimate that at least 20% of present-day spiral galaxies have formed the bulk\nof their stars at relatively recent epochs, during the last 8-9 Gyr, at\nredshifts less than ~ 1. Since they are heavily extincted, we predict their IR\nluminosities to be relatively large, around Lir = 10^11 Lsun, i.e. near or\nslightly below the luminosities of the galaxies detected by ISO in the same\nredshift range. Taking into account the integrated IR luminosity of the LCG\ngalaxy population can lead to a significant upward revision of the cosmic SFR\ndensity in the redshift range from 0.5 to 1. \n\n"}

Since\ngroups are abundant and therefore have a large covering fraction on the sky,\nlensing by groups is likely to be very important observationally. Besides, it\nhas recently become clear that many lens models for strong lensing by\nindividual galaxies require external shear to reproduce the observed image\ngeometries; in many cases a nearby group is detected that could provide this\nshear. In this work, we study the expected lensing behavior of galaxy groups in\nboth the weak and strong lensing regime. We examine the shear and magnification\nproduced by a group and its dependence on the detailed mass distribution within\nthe group. We find that the peak value of the weak lensing shear signal is of\nthe order of 3 per cent and varies by a factor of about 2 for different mass\ndistributions. These variations are large enough to be detectable in the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey (SDSS). In the strong lensing regime we find that the image\ngeometries and typical magnifications are sensitive to the group properties and\nthat groups can easily provide enough external shear to produce quadruple\nimages. We investigate the statistical properties of lensing galaxies that are\nnear or part of a group and find that statistical lens properties, like the\ndistribution of time delays, are affected measurably by the presence of the\ngroup which can therefore introduce an additional systematic error in the\nmeasurement of the Hubble constant from such systems. We conclude that both the\ndetection of weak lensing by groups and accurate observations of strong galaxy\nlens systems near groups could provide important information on the total mass\nand matter distribution within galaxy groups. \n\n"}

We rediscuss here several subtle issues\ninvolved in this work. So far only the scientific critique to this work was due\nto Tereno (astro-ph/9905144, astro-ph/9905298) and which was answered in Mitra\n(astro-ph/9905175, astro-ph/9905175, astro-ph/9905329). Now Tereno\n(gr-qc/0111073) has also admitted that the local 3-speed of a free particle as\nconventionally defined by all previous authors and as measured in any\ncoordinate system, is indeed c at the EH. Further since the acceleration SCALAR\nBLOWS UP at the EH, our result that there cannot be any EH at a finite R is\nreconfirmed. We explicitly show here that the final state of spherical collapse\nof very massive stars corresponds to a zero mass BH with 2M/R ->0. But at any\nfinite epoch there would be a Eternally Collapsing Objects (ECO) of finite\nmass. However, if quantum back reaction in the strong gravity regime would\ncause a phase transition p ~ rho, there could be static ultracompact objects\n(UCO) of ~ 10 M (solar). Further, if the phase transition goes proceeds to p=\n-rho, there could be UCOs of arbitrary high mass (Mazur & Mottola,\nastro-ph/0109035). Both ECOs and UCOs are expected to possess strong internal\nmagnetic field whereas the the same for a BH is zero.

Observations made with the Chandra X-ray\nObservatory demonstrate the presence of up to three sources of X-ray emission\nfrom the Tornado: a relatively bright region of dimensions 2'x1' coincident\nwith and interior to the brightest radio emission at the \"head\" of the Tornado,\nplus two fainter extended regions possibly associated with the Tornado's\n\"tail\". No X-ray point sources associated with the Tornado are seen down to a\n3-sigma luminosity (0.5-10 keV) of 1e33 ergs/s, for a distance to the system of\n12 kpc. The spectrum of the brightest region of X-rays is consistent with a\nheavily absorbed (N_H ~ 1e23 cm^-2) thermal plasma of temperature kT ~ 0.6 keV;\nan absorbed power law can also fit the data, but implies an extremely steep\nphoton index.

The distribution of orbital\neccentricity vs. orbital period (e-log(P)) displays a distinct transition from\neccentric to circular orbits at an orbital period of ~ 10 days. The transition\nis due to tidal circularization of the closest binaries. The population of\nbinary orbits in M35 provide a significantly improved constraint on the rate of\ntidal circularization at an age of 150 Myr. We propose a new and more robust\ndiagnostic of the degree of tidal circularization in a binary population based\non a functional fit to the e-log(P) distribution. We call this new measure the\ntidal circularization period. The tidal circularization period of a binary\npopulation represents the orbital period at which a binary orbit with the most\nfrequent initial orbital eccentricity circularizes (defined as e = 0.01) at the\nage of the population. We determine the tidal circularizationperiod for M35 as\nwell as for 7 additional binary populations spanning ages from the pre\nmain-sequence (~ 3 Myr) to late main-sequence (~ 10 Gyr), and use Monte Carlo\nerror analysis to determine the uncertainties on the derived circularization\nperiods.

This is emitted mainly by near-resonant material in the inner disc\n(bar), and is absorbed by near-resonant material in the outer disc and in the\nhalo. As a result of this, the bar becomes stronger and rotates slower. Bulges\nare not a homogeneous class of objects. Based on their formation history, one\ncan distinguish three types. Classical bulges are mainly formed before the\nactual disc component, from collapses or mergers and the corresponding\ndissipative processes. Boxy/peanut bulges are parts of bars seen edge-on.\nFinally, disc-like bulges are formed by the inflow of material to the center\ndue to bar torques.

Galaxies with regular HI discs tend to have strong emission from ionised\ngas. In these cases, the similar kinematics of the neutral hydrogen and ionised\ngas suggest that they form one structure. We do not find a clear trend between\nthe presence of HI and the global age of the stellar population or the global\ndynamical characteristics of the galaxies. Our observations support the idea\nthat gas accretion is common and does not happen exclusively in peculiar\nearly-type galaxies. For the majority of the cases the gas is likely acquired\nthrough merging, but the lack of correlation with the stellar population age\nsuggests that smooth, cold accretion could be an alternative scenario, at least\nin some galaxies. In either cases, the data suggest that early-type galaxies\ncontinue to build their mass up to the present. \n\n"}

The lensing configuration suggests that the high\nsurface brightness ``core'' is the M=20 magnified central 1 kpc of the galaxy\n(seen at a spatial resolution of about 200 pc in the source plane), whereas the\nfainter ``arc'' is a more strongly magnified peripheral region of the same\ngalaxy at about a half-light radius, which otherwise appears to be a typical\nz=3 Lyman break galaxy.\n  The overall shape of the position-velocity diagram resembles the ``rotation\ncurves'' of the inner few kpcs of nearby L* spiral galaxies. The projected\nvelocities rise rapidly to 75 km/s within the core. This implies a dynamical\nmass of M_dyn = 10^9.3 M_sun within the central kpc, and suggests that in this\nsystem the equivalent of the mass of a present-day L* bulge at the same radius\nwas already in place by z>=3.

Applying these exact cutoffs to the\nOSUBSGS data yields a comparable optical B-band bar fraction at z~0 of ~\n34%+/-6%.

Assuming a\nstandard neutron star mass of 1.4 Msol, we show here that the inclusion of a\nquadrupolar component, if it is suitably oriented, is sufficient to increase\nsubstantially the pulsed fraction, Pf, up to, or above, the observed values if\nthe stellar radius is 13 km or even 10 km. For models with a radius of 7 km the\nmaximum pulsed fraction obtainable with (isotropic) blackbody emission is of\nthe order of 15% for orthogonal rotators (Vela, Geminga and PSR 1055-52) and\nonly 5% for an inclined rotator as PSR 0656+14. Given the observed values this\nindicates that the neutron stars in Geminga and PSR 0656+14 have radii\nsignificantly larger than 7 km and, given the very specific quadrupole\ncomponents required to increase Pf, even radii of the order of 10 km may be\nunlikely in all four cases.\n  We confirm our previous finding that the pulsed fraction always increases\nwith photon energy, below about 1 keV, when blackbody emission is used and show\nthat it is due to the hardenning of the blackbody spectrum with increasing\ntemperature. The observed decrease of pulsed fraction may thus suggest that the\nemitted spectrum softens with increasing temperature.\n  Finally, we apply our model to reassess the magnetic field effect on the\nouter boundary condition used in neutron star cooling models and show that, in\ncontradistinction to several previous claims, it is very small and most\nprobably results in a slight reduction of the heat flow through the envelope. \n\n"}

We find that there is no contradiction between the\nresults of standard and non-standard statistical analysis; moreover, such\nresults are consistent with theoretical predictions derived from standard CDM\nmodels of galaxy formation, and with the hypothesis of homogeneity at large\nscale ($\\sim 100$ \\h). However, for our SSRS2 volume-limited subsamples we show\nthat the first zero-point of the autocorrelation function $\\xi(s)$ increases\nlinearly with the sample depth, and that its value is comparable to the radius\nof the maximum sphere which can be completely included in the sampled volume;\nthis implies that the true zero-crossing point of $\\xi(s)$ has not been\nreached. We conclude that the apparent fractal behavior is due to a combination\nof a luminosity-dependent correlation amplitude and the recovering of power at\nlarger scales in deeper samples. \n\n"}

In a previous paper (Romeo\n1997), we have devised a method for exploring such effects, and we have focused\non two applications that reveal the dynamical differences between the most\nrepresentative types of softened gravity.

Indeed, it opens a direct route to the discovery of optimal\ntypes of softened gravity for given dynamical requirements, and thus to the\naccomplishment of a physically consistent modelling of disc galaxies, even in\nthe presence of a cold interstellar gaseous component and in situations that\ndemand anisotropic resolution. \n\n"}

High redshift galaxies may, however, emit\nmost of their energy at submillimeter wavelengths if they contain substantial\namounts of dust. The dust would absorb the starlight and reradiate it as\nfar-infrared light, which would be redshifted to the submillimeter range. Here\nwe report a deep survey of two blank regions of sky performed at submillimeter\nwavelengths (450 and 850-micron). If the sources we detect in the 850-micron\nband are powered by star formation, then each must be converting more than 100\nsolar masses of gas per year into stars, which is larger than the maximum star\nformation rates inferred for most optically-selected galaxies. The total amount\nof high redshift star formation is essentially fixed by the level of background\nlight, but where the peak occurs in redshift for the submillimeter is not yet\nestablished. However, the background light contribution from only the sources\ndetected at 850-micron is already comparable to that from the\noptically-selected sources. Establishing the main epoch of star formation will\ntherefore require a combination of optical and submillimeter studies. \n\n"}

In a recent study, Dubinski, Mihos & Hernquist (1996) showed that\nthe formation of prominent tidal tails can be strongly suppressed by massive\nand extended dark haloes. For the large halo-to-disk mass ratio expected in CDM\ncosmologies their sequence of models failed to produce strong tails like those\nobserved in many well-known pairs of interacting galaxies. In order to test\nwhether this effect can constrain the viability of CDM cosmologies, we\nconstruct N-body models of disk galaxies with structural properties derived in\nanalogy to the analytical work of Mo, Mao & White (1998). With a series of\nself-consistent collisionless simulations of galaxy-galaxy mergers we\ndemonstrate that even the disks of very massive dark haloes have no problems\ndeveloping long tidal tails, provided the halo spin parameter is large enough.\nWe show that the halo-to-disk mass ratio is a poor indicator for the ability to\nproduce tails. Instead, the relative size of disk and halo, or alternatively,\nthe ratio of circular velocity to local escape speed at the half mass radius of\nthe disk are more useful criteria. This result holds in all CDM cosmologies.\nThe length of tidal tails is thus unlikely to provide useful constraints on\nsuch models. \n\n"}

However, the\nLyman-alpha line photons emitted by these sources are not eliminated but rather\nscatter until they redshift out of resonance and escape due to the Hubble\nexpansion of the surrounding intergalactic HI. We calculate the resulting\nbrightness distribution and the spectral shape of the diffuse Lyman-alpha line\nemission around high redshift sources, before the intergalactic medium was\nreionized. Typically, the Lyman-alpha photons emitted by a source at z=10\nscatter over a characteristic angular radius of order 15 arcseconds around the\nsource and compose a line which is broadened and redshifted by about a thousand\nkm/s relative to the source. The scattered photons are highly polarized.\nDetection of the diffuse Lyman-alpha halos around high redshift sources would\nprovide a unique tool for probing the neutral intergalactic medium before the\nepoch of reionization.

As a first step in a systematic study\nof these objects, we establish a well-defined sample of SXW QSOs which includes\nall alpha_ox<=-2 QSOs from the Boroson & Green (1992) sample of 87 BQS QSOs.\nSXW QSOs comprise about 11% of this optically selected QSO sample. From an\nanalysis of CIV absorption in the 55 BG92 QSOs with available CIV data, we find\na remarkably strong correlation between alpha_ox and the CIV absorption\nequivalent width. This correlation suggests that absorption is the primary\ncause of soft X-ray weakness in QSOs, and it reveals a continuum of absorption\nproperties connecting unabsorbed QSOs, X-ray warm absorber QSOs, SXW QSOs and\nBAL QSOs. From a practical point of view, our correlation demonstrates that\nselection by soft X-ray weakness is an effective (>=80% successful) and\nobservationally inexpensive way to find low-redshift QSOs with strong and\ninteresting ultraviolet absorption. We have also identified several notable\ndifferences between the optical emission-line properties of SXW QSOs and those\nof the other BG92 QSOs. SXW QSOs show systematically low [O III] luminosities\nas well as distinctive H-beta profiles. They tend to lie toward the weak-[O\nIII] end of BG92 eigenvector 1, as do many low-ionization BAL QSOs.

This\nfact has been used to conjecture that the resulting models correspond to the\nspatially homogeneous (SH) models of Bianchi type I, at least for the case\nwhere the cosmological constant vanish.

According\nto the prevailing understanding of cosmic string dynamics in an expanding\nUniverse, the network of long strings loses its energy first into string loops,\nwhich in turn give off most of their energy as gravitational radiation.\nHowever, it has been suggested by Vincent et al. (VHS) that particle emission\nmay be the dominant energy loss channel for the long string network. In this\ncase, the predicted flux of high energy particles would be much larger. Here we\ncalculate the predicted flux of high energy gamma rays, neutrinos and cosmic\nray antiprotons and protons as a function of the scale of symmetry breaking at\nwhich the strings are produced and as a function of the initial energy m_J of\nthe particle jets which result from the string decay. Assuming the validity of\nthe VHS scenario, we find that due to the interactions with the cosmic\nradiation backgrounds all fluxes but the neutrino flux are suppressed at the\nhighest energies. This indicates that the observed events above the GZK cutoff\ncan only be accounted for in this scenario if the primary particle is a\nneutrino and the scale of the symmetry breaking is somewhat less than the GUT\nscale. The domain of parameter space corresponding to GUT-scale symmetry\nbreaking is excluded also by the current observations below the GZK cutoff.
