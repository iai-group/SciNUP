The nonresonant contributions arising from $B\\to\nP_1P_2$ transitions are evaluated using heavy meson chiral perturbation theory\n(HMChPT). The momentum dependence of nonresonant amplitudes is assumed to be in\nthe exponential form $e^{-\\alpha_{NR}} p_B\\cdot(p_i+p_j)}$ so that the HMChPT\nresults are recovered in the soft meson limit $p_i, p_j\\to 0$. In addition, we\nhave identified another large source of the nonresonant signal in the matrix\nelements of scalar densities, e.g. $<K\\bar K|\\bar ss|0>$, which can be\nconstrained from the decay $\\bar B^0\\to K_SK_SK_S$ or $B^-\\to K^-K_SK_S$. The\nintermediate vector meson contributions to 3-body decays are identified through\nthe vector current, while the scalar meson resonances are mainly associated\nwith the scalar density. Their effects are described in terms of the\nBreit-Wigner formalism. Our main results are: (i) All KKK modes are dominated\nby the nonresonant background. The predicted branching ratios of\n$K^+K^-K_{S(L)}$, $K^+K^-K^-$ and $K^-K_SK_S$ modes are consistent with the\ndata within errors. (ii) Although the penguin-dominated $B^0\\to K^+K^-K_{S}$\ndecay is subject to a potentially significant tree pollution, its effective\n$\\sin 2\\beta$ is very similar to that of the $K_SK_SK_S$ mode. However, direct\nCP asymmetry of the former, being of order -4%, is more prominent than the\nlatter.

At the parton level, we analyze single photon production in gluon\nfusion, gg \\to \\gamma g, with open string states propagating in intermediate\nchannels. If the photon mixes with the gauge boson of the baryon number, which\nis a common feature of D-brane quivers, the amplitude appears already at the\nstring disk level.

These resonances\nare usually believed to have multi-TeV mass due to electroweak precision\nconstraints, placing them on the edge of LHC discovery reach. Searching for\nthem is made particularly challenging because hadronically decaying electroweak\nbosons produced at such high energy will appear very similar to QCD jets. In\nthis work we revisit the possibility of discovering these resonances at the\nLHC, taking advantage of recently developed jet substructure techniques. We\nmake a systematic investigation of substructure performance for the\nidentification of highly Lorentz-boosted electroweak bosons, which should also\nbe applicable to more general new physics searches. We then estimate the\nmodel-independent Z' discovery reach for the most promising final-state\nchannels, and find significant improvements compared to previous analyses.

These factors combine to\nmake the technipions more visible in both channels than a standard model Higgs\nwould be. Hence, the recent ATLAS and CMS searches for Higgs bosons exclude the\npresence of technipions with masses from 110 GeV to nearly twice the top-quark\nmass in technicolor models that (a) include colored technifermions (b) feature\ntopcolor dynamics and (c) have technicolor groups with three or more\ntechnicolors. For certain models, the limits also apply out to higher\ntechnipion masses or down to the minimum number of technicolors. The limits may\nbe softened somewhat in models where extended technicolor plays a significant\nrole in producing the top quark's mass. Additional LHC data on di-tau and\ndi-photon final states will be extremely valuable in further exploring\ntechnicolor parameter space. \n\n"}

By constructing the two-state mixing propagator matrix that\nrespects the unitarity constraint and calculating the vertex coupling form\nfactors in a chiral quark model, we can extract the masses, widths and mixing\nangles of the physical states.

Conventionally, this problem is overcome by the use of\nion-gating structures. This method, however, introduces large dead times and\nrestricts trigger rates to a few hundred per second. The ion gate can be\neliminated from the setup by the use of Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) foils for\ngas amplification, which intrinsically suppress the backflow of ions. This\nmakes the continuous operation of a TPC at high rates feasible.\n  In this work, Monte Carlo simulations of the buildup of ion space charge in a\nGEM-based TPC and the correction of the resulting drift distortions are\ndiscussed, based on realistic numbers for the ion backflow in a triple-GEM\namplification stack.

One usually think that it is extremely\nimportant for the measurement of triple Higgs coupling at the high luminosity\nLHC. In this paper, we propose to search for the extra Higgs boson (denoted as\n$S$) utilizing pair production of the SM-like Higgs boson ($H$) which was\ndiscovered in July, 2012.The pair production of $H$ can be huge due to the\nresonant production of heavy scalar $S$, namely $PP \\rightarrow S \\rightarrow\nHH$. The couplings of $H$ with weak gauge boson are similar to ones in the SM\nand it implies that the couplings between $S$ and gauge bosons are likely\nsuppressed. Provided that $S$ is heavy enough, the decay into weak gauge bosons\nmay not be the dominant modes. Instead $S$ can decay into a pair of $H$ and\noffer the promising channel to discover it. In this paper, we studied the 5\npromising decay modes of $H$, i.e. $b\\bar{b}$, $WW^*$, $ZZ^*$, $\\gamma\\gamma$\nand $\\tau^+\\tau^-$, and simulated the signals and backgrounds for the 15\ncombination modes for $HH$ at the LHC with $\\sqrt{s}= 14$ TeV and integrated\nluminosity $\\mathcal{L}=1000fb^{-1}$.

Following this hypothesis, the PMNS mixing\nparameters are taken to be identical to the CKM ones at a unifying high scale.\nThen, they are evolved to a low scale using MSSM renormalization-group\nequations. For both type of neutrinos, the renormalization group evolution\n'naturally' results in a non-zero and small value of leptonic mixing angle\n$\\theta_{13}$. One of the important predictions of this analysis is that, in\nboth cases, the mixing angle $\\theta_{23}$ turns out to be non-maximal for most\nof the parameter range. We also elaborate on the important differences between\nDirac and Majorana neutrinos within our framework and how to experimentally\ndistinguish between the two scenarios.

Therefore, the dark electric dipole\ntransition rate in atoms is boosted if the energy gap between atomic states\nequals the mass of the vector bosons. By using the Zeeman effect, the energy\ngap between the 2S state and the 2P state in hydrogen atoms or hydrogen like\nions can be tuned. The $2S$ state can be populated with electrons due to its\nrelatively long life, which is about $1/7$s.

We have\nperformed a detailed analysis of the physics potential by using the Jiangmen\nUnderground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) to improve the sensitivity to\n0$\\nu\\beta\\beta$ up to a few meV, a major step forward with respect to the\nexperiments currently being planned. JUNO is a 20 kton low-background liquid\nscintillator (LS) detector with 3\\%/$\\sqrt{E \\text{(MeV)}}$ energy resolution,\nnow under construction. It is feasible to build a balloon filled with enriched\nxenon gas (with $^{136}$Xe up to 80\\%) dissolved in LS, inserted into the\ncentral region of the JUNO LS. The energy resolution is $\\sim$1.9\\% at the\n$Q$-value of $^{136}$Xe 0$\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay. Ultra-low background is the key\nfor 0$\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay searches. Detailed studies of background rates from\nintrinsic 2$\\nu\\beta\\beta$ and $^{8}$B solar neutrinos, natural radioactivity,\nand cosmogenic radionuclides (including light isotopes and $^{137}$Xe) were\nperformed and several muon veto schemes were developed.

We conclude that effects are very\nsignificant, both at the inclusive and exclusive level (i.e., both before and\nafter $H^\\pm$ selection cuts are enforced, respectively) and typically of a\ndestructive nature.

These\nobservations are consistent with the scenario of radiative-jet energy loss. For\nthe low-$p_T$ trigger correlations ($2<p_T^t<4$ GeV/$c$), a finite away-side\nyield exists and we explore the dependence of the shape of the away-side within\nthe context of an underlying-event model.

Existing\napproaches attempt to tackle this problem by either synthesizing visible faces\nfrom NIR faces, extracting domain-invariant features from these modalities, or\nprojecting heterogeneous data onto a common latent space for cross-modal\nmatching. In this paper, we take a different approach in which we make use of\nthe Disentangled Variational Representation (DVR) for cross-modal matching.\nFirst, we model a face representation with an intrinsic identity information\nand its within-person variations. By exploring the disentangled latent variable\nspace, a variational lower bound is employed to optimize the approximate\nposterior for NIR and VIS representations. Second, aiming at obtaining more\ncompact and discriminative disentangled latent space, we impose a minimization\nof the identity information for the same subject and a relaxed correlation\nalignment constraint between the NIR and VIS modality variations.

In this paper, we address both these issues by invoking a beyond SM\ninterpretation of the EeV events as due to the decay of a long-lived bino in\nthe R-parity violating (RPV) supersymmetry. In particular, a TeV-scale\nslepton/squark can be resonantly produced through the interaction of the EeV\nneutrino with electrons/nucleons inside Earth, that decays to a light,\nlong-lived bino, which survives the propagation through Earth matter before\ndecaying back to neutrinos, leptons and/or quarks, thus producing upgoing air\nshowers in the atmosphere near ANITA.

To date, most\njet modification studies have been based on comparing the jet properties\nmeasured in heavy-ion collisions to a proton-proton baseline at the same\nreconstructed jet transverse momentum ($p_T$). It is well known, however, that\nthe quenching of jets from their interaction with the medium leads to a\nmigration of jets from higher to lower $p_T$, making it challenging to directly\ninfer the degree and mechanism of jet energy loss. Our proposed quantile\nmatching procedure is inspired by (but not reliant on) the approximate\nmonotonicity of energy loss in the jet $p_T$. In this strategy, jets in\nheavy-ion collisions ordered by $p_T$ are viewed as modified versions of the\nsame number of highest-energy jets in proton-proton collisions, and the\nfractional energy loss as a function of jet $p_T$ is a natural observable\n($Q_{\\rm AA}$). Furthermore, despite non-monotonic fluctuations in the energy\nloss, we use an event generator to validate the strong correlation between the\n$p_T$ of the parton that initiates a heavy-ion jet and the $p_T$ of the vacuum\njet which corresponds to it via the quantile procedure ($p_T^{\\rm quant}$).

Two studies have been conducted: in the\nfirst, we corroborrate previous per-event particle yields in Upsilon(1S)->ggg\nvs. e+e- -> qqbar. In the second, we compare particle production in the\nphoton-tagged process U(1S)->gggamma with that in e+e- -> qqbargamma events.\nFor each particle, we determine the `enhancement' ratio, defined as the ratio\nof particle yields per gluon fragmentation event compared to quark\nfragmentation event. Thus defined, an enhancement of 1.0 implies equal\nper-event production in both gluon and quark fragmentation. In the\nphoton-tagged analysis, we find an enhancement of order unity for protons and\napproximately 1.5 for lambda's.

In\nthe analysis only hadronic decays of the Z boson are considered. A scan over\nHiggs boson masses from 1 to 120 GeV and decay widths from 1 to 3000 GeV\nrevealed no indication for a signal in the data. From a likelihood ratio of\nexpected signal and Standard Model background we determine upper limits on\ncross-section times branching ratio to an invisible final state.

A physical content of\nthe semiclassical approximation is that the quantum fluctuations effects are\nsuppressed and vanish asymptotically. The chiral as well as $U(1)_A$ breakings\nin QCD result from quantum fluctuations. Hence these breakings must be\nsuppressed high in the spectrum and the spectrum of high-lying hadrons must\nexhibit $U(2)_L \\times U(2)_R$ symmetry of the classical QCD Lagrangian. This\nargument can be made stronger for mesons in the large $N_c$ limit. In this\nlimit all mesons are stable against strong decays and the spectrum is infinite.\nHence, one can excite mesons of arbitrary large size with arbitrary large\naction, in which case the semiclassical limit is manifest. Actually we do not\nneed the exact $N_c=\\infty$ limit. For any large action there always exist such\n$N_c$ that the isolated mesons with such an action do exist and can be\ndescribed semiclassically.

We argue\nthat in a suitable limit they are equivalent to each other, the PQCD+Glauber\nmodel being more accurate from a numerical point of view. Finally, we analyze\nRHIC data on Au-Au integrated charged multiplicities in the pQCD+Glauber\nframework, and conclude that at least at central rapidity there is no sign of\ngluon saturation. \n\n"}

With L = 100 fb^-1 at\nsqrt(s) = 350 GeV a relative error of around 10^{-4} is possible. The\npotentially largest systematic uncertainty comes from the knowledge of the\naspect ratio of the detector. \n\n"}
