We define the bimeromorphic {\\it\ncategory} of geometric orbifolds. These interpolate between (compact K\\\" ahler)\nmanifolds and such manifolds with logarithmic structure. These geometric\norbifolds are considered from the point of view of their geometry, and thus\nequipped with the usual invariants of varieties: morphisms and bimeromorphic\nmaps, differential forms, fundamental groups and universal covers, fields of\ndefinition and rational points. The most elementary properties, directly\nadapted from the case of varieties without orbifold structure, are established\nhere. The arguments of [Ca01] can then be directly adapted to extend the main\nstructure results to this orbifold category. We hope to come back to deeper\naspects later. The motivation is that the natural frame for the theory of\nclassification of compact K\\\" ahler (and complex projective) manifolds includes\nat least the category of orbifolds, as shown in [Ca01] by the fonctorial\ndecomposition of {\\it special} manifolds as tower of orbifolds with either\n$\\kappa_+=-\\infty$ or $\\kappa=0$, and also, seemingly, by the minimal model\nprogram, in which most proofs work only after the adjunction of a \"boundary\".\n  Also, fibrations enjoy in the bimeromorphic category of geometric orbifolds\nextension properties not satisfied in the category of varieties without\norbifold structure, permitting to express invariants of the total space from\nthose of the generic fibre and of the base.

The result can be\ninterpreted in terms of a new statistical model that counts `refined' pyramid\npartitions; the model provides a combinatorial realization of wall crossing and\nclarifies the relation between refined pyramid partitions and the refined\ntopological vertex. We also compare the wall crossing behavior of the refined\nBPS invariants with that of the motivic Donaldson-Thomas invariants introduced\nby Kontsevich-Soibelman.

A point inside the polytope is\ndisplaceable by a probe if it lies less than half way along it.

Moreover, the simple functoriality\nproperties of dimensions clarify celebrated identities and extend them to new\ncontexts.\n  We observe that it is advantageous to calculate dimensions, traces and their\nfunctoriality directly in the nonlinear geometric setting of correspondence\ncategories, where they are directly identified with (derived versions of) loop\nspaces, fixed point loci and loop maps, respectively. This results in universal\nnonlinear versions of Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorems, Atiyah-Bott-Lefschetz\ntrace formulas, and Frobenius-Weyl character formulas. On the one hand, we can\nthen linearize by applying sheaf theories, such as the theories of coherent\nsheaves and D-modules, developed by Gaitsgory and Rozenblyum, as functors out\nof correspondence categories (in the spirit of topological field theory). This\nrecovers the familiar classical identities, in families and without any\nsmoothness or transversality assumptions. On the other hand, the formalism also\napplies to higher categorical settings not captured within a linear framework,\nsuch as characters of group actions on categories. \n\n"}

Many\nof these applications seek phase-coherent solutions, i.e., equilibria of the\nmodel. Historically, research has focused on situations where the number of\noscillators, $n$, is extremely large and can be treated as being infinite. More\nrecently, however, applications have arisen in areas such as electrical\nengineering with more modest values of $n$. For these, the equilibria can be\nlocated by finding the real solutions of a system of polynomial equations\nutilizing techniques from algebraic geometry. However, typical methods for\nsolving such systems locate all complex solutions even though only the real\nsolutions give equilibria. In this paper, we present an algorithm to locate\nonly the real solutions of the model, thereby shortening computation time by\nseveral orders of magnitude in certain situations. This is accomplished by\nchoosing specific equilibria representatives and the consequent algebraic\ndecoupling of the system.

On the other hand it is\ninterpreted as the cohomology of a complex dual to the mapping cone of a\ncertain morphism of complexes in the theory of derived categories.

The q-expansion of this function is an analogue of the\nHirzebruch-Zagier generating function for the cohomology classes of curves on a\nHilbert modular surface. This`arithmetic theta function' is used to define an\n`arithmetic theta lift' from modular forms of weight 3/2 to the arithmetic Chow\ngroup of M.

We start with the conjecture of\nHausel-Thaddeus which claims that certain Hodge numbers of moduli spaces of\nflat SL(n,C) and PGL(n,C)-connections on a smooth projective algebraic curve\nagree. We then change our point of view in the non-Abelian Hodge theory of the\ncurve, and concentrate on the SL(n,C) and PGL(n,C) character varieties of the\ncurve. Here we discuss a recent conjecture of Hausel-Rodriguez-Villegas which\nclaims, analogously to the above conjecture, that certain Hodge numbers of\nthese character varieties also agree. We explain that for Hodge numbers of\ncharacter varieties one can use arithmetic methods, and thus we end up\nexplicitly calculating, in terms of Verlinde-type formulas, the number of\nrepresentations of the fundamental group into the finite groups SL(n,F_q) and\nPGL(n,F_q), by using the character tables of these finite groups of Lie type.\nFinally we explain a conjecture which enhances the previous result, and gives a\nsimple formula for the mixed Hodge polynomials, and in particular for the\nPoincare polynomials of these character varieties, and detail the relationship\nto results of Hitchin, Gothen, Garsia-Haiman and Earl-Kirwan.

We show this for a number of\nimportant moduli spaces.\n  More precisely, every singularity of finite type over Z (up to smooth\nparameters) appears on: the Hilbert scheme of curves in projective space; and\nthe moduli spaces of smooth projective general-type surfaces (or\nhigher-dimensional varieties), plane curves with nodes and cusps, stable\nsheaves, isolated threefold singularities, and more. The objects themselves are\nnot pathological, and are in fact as nice as can be: the curves are smooth, the\nsurfaces have very ample canonical bundle, the stable sheaves are torsion-free\nof rank 1, the singularities are normal and Cohen-Macaulay, etc. This justifies\nMumford's philosophy that even moduli spaces of well-behaved objects should be\narbitrarily bad unless there is an a priori reason otherwise.\n  Thus one can construct a smooth curve in projective space whose deformation\nspace has any given number of components, each with any given singularity type,\nwith any given non-reduced behavior along various associated subschemes.\nSimilarly one can give a surface over F_p that lifts to Z/p^7 but not Z/p^8.\n(Of course the results hold in the holomorphic category as well.)\n  It is usually difficult to compute deformation spaces directly from\nobstruction theories.

We use homological perturbation\ntheory to obtain $A_{\\infty}$ algebra structures and some canonically defined\ndeformations of such structures on the cohomology. We formulate the\n$A_{\\infty}$ algebraic mirror symmetry as the identification of the\n$A_{\\infty}$ algebras together with their canonical deformations constructed\nthis way on different manifolds. \n\n"}
{"id": "math/9911198", "contents": "Title: Stability of conic bundles (with an appendix by Mundet i Riera) Abstract: Roughly speaking, a conic bundle is a surface, fibered over a curve, such\nthat the fibers are conics (not necessarily smooth). We define stability for\nconic bundles and construct a moduli space. We prove that (after fixing some\ninvariants) these moduli spaces are irreducible (under some conditions). Conic\nbundles can be thought of as generalizations of orthogonal bundles on curves.\nWe show that in this particular case our definition of stability agrees with\nthe definition of stability for orthogonal bundles. Finally, in an appendix by\nI. Mundet i Riera, a Hitchin-Kobayashi correspondence is stated for conic\nbundles. \n\n"}
