By \"non-trivial background\" we mean either a non-vacuum state in\nMinkowski spacetime or an arbitrary state in a curved spacetime. Starting with\nthe case of a flat spacetime, the basic properties of the particle and\nquasiparticle propagation are analyzed using two different methods other than\nthe conventional mean-field-based techniques: on the one hand, the quantum\nstate corresponding to the quasiparticle excitation is explicitly constructed;\non the other hand, the spectral representation of the two-point propagators is\nanalyzed. Both methods lead to the same results: the energy and decay rate of\nthe quasiparticles are determined by the real and imaginary parts of the\nretarded self-energy respectively. These general results are applied to two\nparticular quantum systems: first, a scalar particle immersed in a thermal\ngraviton bath; second, a simplified atomic model, seizing the opportunity to\nconnect with other statistical and first-quantized approaches. In the second\npart of the thesis the results are extended to curved spacetime. Working with a\nquasilocal quasiparticle concept the flat-spacetime results are recovered. In\ncosmology, within the adiabatic approximation, it is possible to go beyond the\nflat spacetime results and find additional effects due to the universe\nexpansion. The cosmologically-induced effects are analyzed, obtaining that\nthere might be an additional contribution to the particle decay due to the\nuniverse expansion.

{"id": "0803.3725", "contents": "Title: Axionic Mirage Mediation Abstract: Although the mirage mediation is one of the most plausible mediation\nmechanisms of supersymmetry breaking, it suffers from two crucial problems. One\nis the \\mu-/B \\mu-problem and the second is the cosmological one. The former\nstems from the fact that the B parameter tends to be comparable with the\ngravitino mass, which is two order of magnitude larger than the other soft\nmasses. The latter problem is caused by the decay of the modulus whose\nbranching ratio into the gravitino pair is sizable. In this paper, we propose a\nmodel of mirage mediation, in which Peccei-Quinn symmetry is incorporated. In\nthis axionic mirage mediation, it is shown that the PQ symmetry breaking scale\nis dynamically determined around 10^{10-12} GeV due to the supersymmetry\nbreaking effects, and the \\mu-problem can be solved naturally. Furthermore, in\nour model, the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is the axino, that is the\nsuperpartner of the axion. The overabundance of the LSPs due to decays of\nmodulus/gravitino, which is the most serious cosmological difficulty in the\nmirage mediation, can be avoided if the axino is sufficiently light. The\nnext-LSPs (NLSPs) produced by the gravitino decay eventually decay into the\naxino LSPs, yielding the dominant component of the axinos remaining today. It\nis shown that the axino with the mass of O(100) MeV is naturally realized,\nwhich can constitute the dark matter of the Universe, with the free-streaming\nlength of the order of 0.1 Mpc. The saxion, the real scalar component of the\naxion supermultiplet, can also be cosmologically harmless due to the dilution\nof the modulus decay. The lifetime of NLSP is relatively long, but much shorter\nthan 1 sec., when the big-bang nucleosynthesis commences. The decay of NLSP\nwould provide intriguing collider signatures. \n\n"}

At the gauge theory \"Planck scale\" of about\n1-2 GeV, the ratios of the soft Pomeron contributions to the photoproduction\ncross-sections of different vector mesons involve not only the obvious quark\nmodel factors, but also the Boltzmann factors $e^{-4 M_V/T_0}$, with $T_0$ the\ntemperature of the dual black hole.

These mechanisms\nutilize the extended five-dimensional (5D) electroweak gauge symmetry [SU(2)_L\nx SU(2)_R x U(1)_X] which is already strongly motivated in order to satisfy\nelectroweak precision tests in this framework. New choices of representations\nfor leptons under this symmetry (naturally) can allow small mixing angles for\nleft-handed (LH) charged leptons and simultaneously large mixing angles for\ntheir SU(2)_L partners, i.e., the LH neutrinos, with the neutrino data being\naccounted for by the latter mixings. Enhancement of charged lepton flavor\nviolation by the large mixing angle observed in leptonic charged currents,\nwhich is present for the minimal choice of representations where the LH charged\nlepton and neutrino mixing angles are similar, can thus be avoided in these\nmodels. This idea might also be useful for suppressing the contributions to\nB_{d, s} mixing in this framework and in order to suppress flavor violation\nfrom superpartners (instead of from KK modes) in 5D \"flavorful supersymmetry\"\nmodels.

We show that quite generally they also acquire (small)\nelectric charges under the visible electromagnetic gauge group. This is a\nresult of \"magnetic mixing\" which, as we show, often arises as a natural\npartner of kinetic mixing. Both kinetic and magnetic mixing are naturally\ninduced radiatively even if the low-energy U(1)s arise from a single\nnon-abelian gauge group. We argue that the hidden sector monopoles can be light\nand their electric minicharges could thus be testable in current and near\nfuture low-energy experiments. \n\n"}

After introducing the Sasaki-Mukhanov variable,\nthe combination of spatial metric fluctuation and matter inhomogeneity for\nwhich the action in General Relativity has canonical form, we find that this\nvariable has the standard time derivative term in the second order action, and\nthat the extra degree of freedom is non-dynamical.

In the\nstandard approach to cosmology it is assumed that this relation is the same as\nin the homogeneous universe. As the real universe is not homogeneous there are\nseveral methods to calculate the correction. The weak lensing approximation and\nthe Dyer-Roeder relation are one of them. This paper establishes a link between\nthese two approximations. It is shown that if the universe is homogeneous with\nonly small, vanishing after averaging, density fluctuations along the line of\nsight, then the distance correction is negligible. It is also shown that a\nvanishing 3D average of density fluctuations does not imply that the mean of\ndensity fluctuations along the line of sight is zero.

The\nexcursion set theory is also a powerful formalism to study other properties of\ndark matter halos such as halo bias, accretion rate, formation time, merging\nrate and the formation history of halos.

This equality is very peculiar because it need not\nhave occurred at all and, if it did, should only have happened once (right now)\nin the context of LambdaCDM.

The first background\nis due to linear dilatons and the associated Kalb-Ramond field (axion) in four\nnon-compact space-time dimensions of the string, and can be described within\nthe framework of local effective lagrangians. The axion is linear in the time\ncoordinate of the Einstein frame and gives rise to a constant torsion which\ncouples to the fermion spin through a gravitational covariant derivative. This\nleads to different energy-momentum dispersion relations for fermions and\nanti-fermions and hence leptogenesis. The next two backgrounds go beyond the\nlocal effective lagrangian framework. One is a stochastic (Lorentz Violating)\nFinsler metric which again leads to different dispersion relations between\nfermions and antifermions. The third background of primary interest is the one\ndue to populations of stochastically fluctuating point-like space-time defects\nthat can be encountered in string/brane theory (D0 branes). Only neutral matter\ninteracts non-trivially with these defects, as a consequence of charge\nconservation. Hence, such a background singles out neutrinos among the Standard\nModel excitations as the ones interacting predominantly with the defects. The\nback-reaction of the defects on the space-time due to their interaction with\nneutral matter results in stochastic Finsler-like metrics (similar to our\nsecond background).

However, it is well known that nonlinear sigma models\n(NLSMs) with nontrivial K\\\"ahler transformations are problematic to couple to\nsupergravity. An additional field is necessary to make the K\\\"ahler potential\nof the NLSM invariant in supergravity. This field must have a shift symmetry\n--- making it a candidate for the inflaton (or axion). We give an explicit\nexample of such a model for the coset space $SU(3)/SU(2) \\times U(1)$, with the\nHiggs as the NGB, including breaking the inflaton's shift symmetry and\nproducing a chaotic inflation potential. This construction can also be applied\nto other models, such as one based on $E_7/SO(10) \\times U(1) \\times U(1)$\nwhich incorporates the first two generations of (light) quarks as the\nNambu-Goldstone multiplets, and has an axion in addition to the inflaton. Along\nthe way we clarify and connect previous work on understanding NLSMs in\nsupergravity and the origin of the extra field (which is the inflaton here),\nincluding a connection to Witten-Bagger quantization. This framework has wide\napplications to model building; a light particle from a NLSM requires, in\nsupergravity, exactly the structure for chaotic inflaton or an axion. \n\n"}

We show that,\nbecause of the quenching of the energy of partons within a jet, even when\n$K\\neq 0$ the jets that survive with some specified energy in the final state\nare narrower than jets with that energy in proton-proton collisions. For this\nreason, many standard observables are rather insensitive to $K$. We propose a\nnew differential jet shape ratio observable in which the effects of transverse\nmomentum broadening are apparent. We also analyze the response of the medium to\nthe passage of the jet through it, noting that the momentum lost by the jet\nappears as the momentum of a wake in the medium.

Coupled with the fact\nthat supersymmetry solves the big hierarchy problem related to the quadratic\ndivergence to the Higgs boson mass square along with the fact that there is no\nalternative paradigm that allows us to extrapolate physics from the electroweak\nscale to the grand unification scale consistent with experiment, supersymmetry\nremains a compelling framework for new physics beyond the standard model.

Moreover, for\npotentials with a rich enough structure, the walls can join and form a (at\nlarge scales) homogeneous and isotropic network that dominates the energy\ndensity of the universe for some time before decaying. In this thesis, we study\nthe faith of large scale perturbations in a cosmology with a short period of\ndomain wall dominance. Treating the domain wall network as a relativistic\nelastic solid at large scales, we show that the perturbations that exited the\nhorizon during inflation get suppressed during the domain wall era, before\nre-entering the horizon. This power suppression occurs because, unlike a\nfluid-like universe, a solid-like universe can support sizable anisotropic\nstress gradients across large scales which effectively act as mass for the\nscalar and tensor modes. Interestingly, the amplitude of the primordial scalar\npower spectrum can be closer to one in this cosmology and still give the\nobserved value of $10^{-9}$ today. As a result, the usual bounds on the energy\nscale of inflation get relaxed to values closer to the (more natural) Planck\nscale. In the last part of this thesis, as an existence proof, we present a\nhybrid inflation model with $N$ `waterfall' fields that can realize the\nproposed cosmology. In this model, a domain wall network forms when an\napproximate $O(N)$ symmetry gets spontaneously broken at the end of inflation,\nand for $N \\geq 5$, we show that there is a region in parameter space where the\nnetwork dominates the energy density for a few e-folds before decaying and\nreheating the universe. \n\n"}

We estimate that ~100 templates (and ~10 simulations\nwith different mass ratios) are needed to detect waves from non-spinning binary\nblack holes with total masses in the range 100 Msun < M < 400 Msun using\ninitial LIGO. Of course, many more simulation runs will be needed to confirm\nthat the correct physics is captured in the numerical evolutions. From this\nperspective, we also discuss sources of systematic errors in numerical waveform\nextraction and provide order of magnitude estimates for the computational cost\nof simulations that could be used to estimate the cost of parameter space\nsurveys. Finally, we discuss what information from near-future numerical\nsimulations of compact binary systems would be most useful for enhancing the\ndetectability of such events with contemporary gravitational wave detectors and\nemphasize the role of numerical simulations for the interpretation of eventual\ngravitational-wave observations. \n\n"}

The production\nrate for such black holes has been extensively studied for the case of a\nproton-proton collision at \\sqrt s = 14 TeV and for a lead-lead collision at\n\\sqrt s = 5.5 TeV at LHC. As the parton energy density is much higher at\nlead-lead collisions than in pp collisions at LHC, one natural question is\nwhether the produced black holes will be able to absorb the partons formed in\nthe lead-lead collisions and eventually `eat' the quark-gluon plasma formed at\nLHC. In this paper, we make a quantitative analysis of this possibility and\nfind that since the energy density of partons formed in lead-lead collisions at\nLHC is about 500 GeV/fm^3, the rate of absorption for one of these black holes\nis much smaller than the rate of evaporation. Hence, we argue that black holes\nformed in such collisions will decay very quickly, and will not absorb very\nmany nearby partons. More precisely, we show that for the black hole mass to\nincrease via parton absorption at the LHC the typical energy density of quarks\nand gluons should be of the order of 10^{10} GeV/fm^3. As LHC will not be able\nto produce such a high energy density partonic system, the black hole will not\nbe able to absorb a sufficient number of nearby partons before it decays. The\ntypical life time of the black hole formed at LHC is found to be a small\nfraction of a fm/c. \n\n"}

Performing the analysis in the R_n-R_c plane, which is\nvery suitable for monitoring various effects, we demonstrate that we may, in\nfact, move straightforwardly to the experimental region in this plane through\nan enhancement of the relevant EW penguin parameter q. We derive analytical\nbounds for q in terms of a quantity L, that measures the violation of the\nLipkin sum rule, and point out that strong phases around 90 deg are favoured by\nthe data, in contrast to QCD factorisation. The B -> pi K modes imply a\ncorrelation between q and the angle gamma that in the limit of negligible\nrescattering effects and colour suppressed EW penguins depends only on the\nvalue of L.
