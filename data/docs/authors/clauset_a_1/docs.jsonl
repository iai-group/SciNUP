Changing the parameters of the distance-dependence, we found a rich\nphase diagram, with different transient and recurrent phases in the context of\nrandom walks on networks. We performed the calculations in two limiting cases:\nin the annealed case, where the rearrangement of the random links is fast, and\nin the quenched case, where the link rearrangement is slow compared to the\nmotion of the random walker or the surface. It has been well-established that\nin a large class of interacting systems, adding an arbitrarily small density\nof, possibly long-range, quenched random links to a regular lattice interaction\ntopology, will give rise to mean-field (or annealed) like behavior. In some\ncases, however, mean-field scaling breaks down, such as in diffusion or in the\nEdwards-Wilkinson process in \"low-dimensional\" small-world networks. This\nbreak-down can be understood by treating the random links perturbatively, where\nthe mean-field (or annealed) prediction appears as the lowest-order term of a\nnaive perturbation expansion.

This screening effect is attributed to the highly degenerate\nconfigurations of the frustrated environment. This slow relaxation is due to an\nentropy effect and is different from those due to the energy barrier observed\nin systems such as random ferromagnets. In the present system, even if there is\nno energy gap, the slow relaxation still takes place. Thus, we call this\nphenomenon ``entropic slowing down''. Here, we study the mechanism of entropic\nslowing down quantitatively in an Ising spin model with the so-called decorated\nbonds. The spins included in decorated bonds (decoration spins) cause a\npeculiar density of states, which causes on entropy-induced screening effect.\nWe analytically estimate the time scale of the system that increases\nexponentially with the number of decoration spins.

Extending arguments developed to treat non-conserved\ncoarsening, we obtain approximate analytic results for the distribution of\ndomain areas and perimeters during the dynamics. The main approximation is to\nregard the interfaces separating domains as moving independently. While this is\ntrue in the non-conserved case, it is not in the conserved one. Our results can\ntherefore be considered as a first-order approximation for the distributions.\nIn contrast to the celebrated Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner distribution of\nstructures of the minority phase in the limit of very small concentration, the\ndistribution of domain areas in the 50:50 case does not have a cut-off. Large\nstructures (areas or perimeters) retain the morphology of a percolative or\ncritical initial condition, for quenches from high temperatures or the critical\npoint respectively. The corresponding distributions are described by a $c\nA^{-\\tau}$ tail, where $c$ and $\\tau$ are exactly known.

Besides formation of\nlanes of uniform walking direction and oscillations at bottlenecks at moderate\ndensities, it was recently discovered that stop-and-go waves [D. Helbing et\nal., Phys. Rev.

Although the behavior of pedestrian crowds under\nextreme conditions is decisive for the safety of crowds during the access to or\negress from mass events as well as for situations of emergency evacuation,\nthere is still a lack of empirical studies of extreme crowding. Therefore, this\npaper discusses how one may study high-density conditions based on suitable\nvideo data.

One crucial step when studying the structure and dynamics of\nnetworks is to identify communities: groups of related nodes that correspond to\nfunctional subunits such as protein complexes or social spheres. Communities in\nnetworks often overlap such that nodes simultaneously belong to several groups.\nMeanwhile, many networks are known to possess hierarchical organization, where\ncommunities are recursively grouped into a hierarchical structure. However, the\nfact that many real networks have communities with pervasive overlap, where\neach and every node belongs to more than one group, has the consequence that a\nglobal hierarchy of nodes cannot capture the relationships between overlapping\ngroups. Here we reinvent communities as groups of links rather than nodes and\nshow that this unorthodox approach successfully reconciles the antagonistic\norganizing principles of overlapping communities and hierarchy. In contrast to\nthe existing literature, which has entirely focused on grouping nodes, link\ncommunities naturally incorporate overlap while revealing hierarchical\norganization. We find relevant link communities in many networks, including\nmajor biological networks such as protein-protein interaction and metabolic\nnetworks, and show that a large social network contains hierarchically\norganized community structures spanning inner-city to regional scales while\nmaintaining pervasive overlap. Our results imply that link communities are\nfundamental building blocks that reveal overlap and hierarchical organization\nin networks to be two aspects of the same phenomenon. \n\n"}

As usual, it is assumed that the system maximizes the entropy\nfunctional $S$, subjected to the standard conditions; i.e., constant energy and\nnormalization of the probability distribution. However, an extra conserved\nconstraint function $F$ is also assumed to exist, which forces the system to\nremain in the metastable configuration. Further, after assuming additivity for\ntwo quasi-independent subsystems, and that the new constraint commutes with\ndensity matrix $\\rho$, it is argued that F should be an homogeneous function of\nthe density matrix, at least for systems in which the spectrum is sufficiently\ndense to be considered as continuous. The explicit form of $F$ turns to be\n$F(p_{i})=p_{i}^{q}$, where $p_i$ are the eigenvalues of the density matrix and\n$q$ is a real number to be determined.

Recent studies\nhave focused mainly on evaluation and prediction of on-going spreading, which\nstrongly depends on detailed information about the structure of social\ncontacts, human traveling patterns and biological activity of virus, etc.\n  Methodology/Principal Findings: In this work we analyzed the distributions of\nconfirmed cases of influenza A (H1N1) in different levels and find the Zipf's\nlaw and Heaps' law. Similar scaling properties were also observed for severe\nacute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and bird cases of H5N1.

Here we address this issue, as well as the\ngeneral problem of comparing statistics from distinct eras, by detrending the\nseasonal statistics of professional baseball players. We detrend player\nstatistics by normalizing achievements to seasonal averages, which accounts for\nchanges in relative player ability resulting from both exogenous and endogenous\nfactors, such as talent dilution from expansion, equipment and training\nimprovements, as well as performance enhancing drugs (PED). In this paper we\ncompare the probability density function (pdf) of detrended career statistics\nto the pdf of raw career statistics for five statistical categories -- hits\n(H), home runs (HR), runs batted in (RBI), wins (W) and strikeouts (K) -- over\nthe 90-year period 1920-2009. We find that the functional form of these pdfs\nare stationary under detrending. This stationarity implies that the statistical\nregularity observed in the right-skewed distributions for longevity and success\nin professional baseball arises from both the wide range of intrinsic talent\namong athletes and the underlying nature of competition. Using this simple\ndetrending technique, we examine the top 50 all-time careers for H, HR, RBI, W\nand K.

As an example, in networks of communication via email,\ntext messages, or phone calls, edges represent sequences of instantaneous or\npractically instantaneous contacts. In some cases, edges are active for\nnon-negligible periods of time: e.g., the proximity patterns of inpatients at\nhospitals can be represented by a graph where an edge between two individuals\nis on throughout the time they are at the same ward.

Abstract: The growth of the average kinetic energy of classical particles is studied\nfor potentials that are random both in space and time.

This regime was studied in the framework of the\nFokker-Planck approximation. The diffusion coefficient in velocity was\nexpressed in terms of the average power spectral density, which is the Fourier\ntransform of the potential correlation function. This enabled to establish a\nscaling form for the Fokker-Planck equation and to compute the large and small\nvelocity limits of the diffusion coefficient. A classification of the random\npotentials into universality classes, characterized by the form of the\ndiffusion coefficient in the limit of large and small velocity, was performed.\nIt was shown that one dimensional systems exhibit a large variety of novel\nuniversality classes, contrary to systems in higher dimensions, where only one\nuniversality class is possible.

In contrast, in agglomerative percolation (AP)\nclusters grow by choosing randomly a `target cluster' and joining it with all\nits neighbors, as defined by the same set of virtual links. Previous studies\nshowed that AP is in different universality classes from OP for several types\nof (virtual) networks (linear chains, trees, Erdos-Renyi networks), but most\nsurprising were the results for 2-d lattices: While AP on the triangular\nlattice was found to be in the OP universality class, it behaved completely\ndifferently on the square lattice. In the present paper we explain this\nstriking violation of universality by invoking bipartivity. While the square\nlattice is a bipartite graph, the triangular lattice is not. In conformity with\nthis we show that AP on the honeycomb and simple cubic (3-d) lattices -- both\nof which are bipartite -- are also not in the OP universality classes.

We illustrate these challenges, and show one way to resolve them, by\nconsidering the key network-analysis problem of dividing a graph into\ncommunities or blocks of nodes with homogeneous patterns of links to the rest\nof the network. The standard tool for doing this is the stochastic block model,\nunder which the probability of a link between two nodes is a function solely of\nthe blocks to which they belong. This imposes a homogeneous degree distribution\nwithin each block; this can be unrealistic, so degree-corrected block models\nadd a parameter for each node, modulating its over-all degree.

The definition of modularity involves a comparison of\nwithin-community edges in the observed network and that number in an equivalent\nrandomized network. This equivalent randomized network is called the null\nmodel, which serves as a reference. To make the comparison significant, the\nnull model should characterize some features of the observed network. However,\nthe null model in the original definition of modularity is unrealistically\nmixed, in the sense that any node can be linked to any other node without\npreference and only connectivity matters. Thus, it fails to be a good\nrepresentation of real-world networks. A common feature of many real-world\nnetworks is \"similarity attraction\", i.e., edges tend to link to nodes that are\nsimilar to each other. We propose a null model that captures the similarity\nattraction feature. This null model enables us to create a framework for\ndefining a family of Dist-Modularity adapted to various networks, including\nnetworks with additional information on nodes. We demonstrate that\nDist-Modularity is useful in identifying communities at different scales. \n\n"}

Often such\nspectral features are theoretically obtained by considering only local node\nproperties, such as degree distributions. Many networks, however, possess\nlarge-scale modular structures that can drastically influence their spectral\ncharacteristics, and which are neglected in such simplified descriptions. Here\nwe obtain in a unified fashion the spectrum of a large family of operators,\nincluding the adjacency, Laplacian and normalized Laplacian matrices, for\nnetworks with generic modular structure, in the limit of large degrees. We\nfocus on the conditions necessary for the merging of the isolated eigenvalues\nwith the continuous band of the spectrum, after which the planted modular\nstructure can no longer be easily detected by spectral methods. This is a\ncrucial transition point which determines when a modular structure is strong\nenough to affect a given dynamical process.

However, little is known about the social\nnetworks within these online games, or how they evolve over time. Understanding\nhuman social dynamics within massive online games can shed new light on social\ninteractions in general and inform the development of more engaging systems.\nHere, we study a novel, large friendship network, inferred from nearly 18\nbillion social interactions over 44 weeks between 17 million individuals in the\npopular online game Halo: Reach. This network is one of the largest, most\ndetailed temporal interaction networks studied to date, and provides a novel\nperspective on the dynamics of online friendship networks, as opposed to mere\ninteraction graphs. Initially, this network exhibits strong structural turnover\nand decays rapidly from a peak size. In the following period, however, both\nnetwork size and turnover stabilize, producing a dynamic structural\nequilibrium. In contrast to other studies, we find that the Halo friendship\nnetwork is non-densifying: both the mean degree and the average pairwise\ndistance are stable, suggesting that densification cannot occur when\nmaintaining friendships is costly. Finally, players with greater long-term\nengagement exhibit stronger local clustering, suggesting a group-level social\nengagement process.

Many networks contain \"communities\" of nodes that are more densely\nconnected to each other than to nodes in the rest of the network. In this\npaper, we investigate the detection of communities in temporal networks\nrepresented as multilayer networks. As a focal example, we study time-dependent\nfinancial-asset correlation networks. We first argue that the use of the\n\"modularity\" quality function---which is defined by comparing edge weights in\nan observed network to expected edge weights in a \"null network\"---is\napplication-dependent. We differentiate between \"null networks\" and \"null\nmodels\" in our discussion of modularity maximization, and we highlight that the\nsame null network can correspond to different null models.

We\nfind that such models, in contrast to MBL systems with quenched disorder,\ntypically exhibit much more severe finite-size effects due to the presence of\ntwo or more vastly different energy scales. In a finite system, this can easily\ncreate an artificial splitting of the density of states (DOS) into bands\nseparated by large energy gaps. We argue that in order for such models to\nfaithfully represent the physics of the thermodynamic limit, the ratio of the\nrelevant coupling parameters must be larger than a certain cutoff that depends\non system size, and should be chosen in such a way that various bands in the\nDOS of a given model overlap with one another.

Regarding eigenvector centrality, we consider the PageRank\nproblem as its typical variant, and design distributed randomized algorithms to\ncompute PageRank for both fixed and time-varying graphs.

Despite that,\nmost governmental reports and several academic works still ignore these\nnonlinearities by often analyzing the raw or the per capita value of urban\nindicators, a practice that actually makes the urban metrics biased towards\nsmall or large cities depending on whether we have super or sublinear\nallometries. By following the ideas of Bettencourt et al., we account for this\nbias by evaluating the difference between the actual value of an urban\nindicator and the value expected by the allometry with the population size. We\nshow that this scale-adjusted metric provides a more appropriate/informative\nsummary of the evolution of urban indicators and reveals patterns that do not\nappear in the evolution of per capita values of indicators obtained from\nBrazilian cities. We also show that these scale-adjusted metrics are strongly\ncorrelated with their past values by a linear correspondence and that they also\ndisplay crosscorrelations among themselves.

The most popular family of random graph null models, called\nconfiguration models, are defined as uniform distributions over a space of\ngraphs with a fixed degree sequence. Commonly, properties of an empirical\nnetwork are compared to properties of an ensemble of graphs from a\nconfiguration model in order to quantify whether empirical network properties\nare meaningful or whether they are instead a common consequence of the\nparticular degree sequence. In this work we study the subtle but important\ndecisions underlying the specification of a configuration model, and\ninvestigate the role these choices play in graph sampling procedures and a\nsuite of applications. We place particular emphasis on the importance of\nspecifying the appropriate graph labeling (stub-labeled or vertex-labeled)\nunder which to consider a null model, a choice that closely connects the study\nof random graphs to the study of random contingency tables. We show that the\nchoice of graph labeling is inconsequential for studies of simple graphs, but\ncan have a significant impact on analyses of multigraphs or graphs with\nself-loops. The importance of these choices is demonstrated through a series of\nthree vignettes, analyzing network datasets under many different configuration\nmodels and observing substantial differences in study conclusions under\ndifferent models. We argue that in each case, only one of the possible\nconfiguration models is appropriate. While our work focuses on undirected\nstatic networks, it aims to guide the study of directed networks, dynamic\nnetworks, and all other network contexts that are suitably studied through the\nlens of random graph null models. \n\n"}

This general task is called community detection in\nnetworks and is analogous to searching for clusters in independent vector data.\nIt is common to evaluate the performance of community detection algorithms by\ntheir ability to find so-called \"ground truth\" communities. This works well in\nsynthetic networks with planted communities because such networks' links are\nformed explicitly based on those known communities. However, there are no\nplanted communities in real world networks. Instead, it is standard practice to\ntreat some observed discrete-valued node attributes, or metadata, as ground\ntruth. Here, we show that metadata are not the same as ground truth, and that\ntreating them as such induces severe theoretical and practical problems. We\nprove that no algorithm can uniquely solve community detection, and we prove a\ngeneral No Free Lunch theorem for community detection, which implies that there\ncan be no algorithm that is optimal for all possible community detection tasks.\nHowever, community detection remains a powerful tool and node metadata still\nhave value so a careful exploration of their relationship with network\nstructure can yield insights of genuine worth. We illustrate this point by\nintroducing two statistical techniques that can quantify the relationship\nbetween metadata and community structure for a broad class of models. We\ndemonstrate these techniques using both synthetic and real-world networks, and\nfor multiple types of metadata and community structure. \n\n"}

Focusing on the problem of\ndetecting small communities in multilayer networks, we study the effects of\nlayer aggregation by developing random-matrix theory for modularity matrices\nassociated with layer-aggregated networks with $N$ nodes and $L$ layers, which\nare drawn from an ensemble of Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi networks.

When layers are aggregated via a summation, we\nobtain $K^*\\varpropto \\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{NL}/T)$, where $T$ is the number of\nlayers across which the community persists.

The number of such\nspecial initial temperatures defines the \\emph{Mpemba index}, whose parity is a\ntopological property of the system. To demonstrate these concepts, we first\nanalyze the different types of Mpemba relaxations in the mean field\nanti-ferromagnet Ising model, which demonstrates a surprisingly rich Mpemba\nphase diagram.

The orientation (which is formally\nlike a spin degree of freedom) determines the self-propulsion direction. The\nbonds represent the possibility to make transitions: to hop between locations;\nor to switch the orientation. In systems of experimental interest (Janus\nparticles), the self-propulsion is induced by illumination. An emergent aspect\nis the topological stochastic disorder (TSD). It is implied by the\nnon-uniformity of the illumination. In technical terms the TSD reflects the\nlocal non-zero circulations (affinities) of the stochastic transitions. This\ntype of disorder, unlike non-homogeneous magnetic field, is non-hermitian, and\ncan lead to the emergence of a complex relaxation spectrum.

Despite the broad relevance of such a scenario to\nmetallic systems, there have been limited investigations of the entanglement\nstructure of the resulting long-time states, in part, due to the fundamental\ndifficulty in solving realistic models for disordered, interacting electrons.\nWe investigate this problem by carefully analyzing two \"toy\" models for\ncoherent quantum transport of diffusive fermions: the celebrated\nthree-dimensional, noninteracting Anderson model and a class of random quantum\ncircuits acting on a chain of qubits, which exactly maps to a diffusive,\ninteracting fermion problem.

This localization can be understood as a consequence of the\nreturn properties of low dimensional random walks, through a mechanism\nreminiscent of weak localization, but insensitive to dephasing. The charge\ndynamics is well-described by a system of coupled hydrodynamic equations, which\nmakes several nontrivial predictions in good agreement with numerics.\nImportantly, these equations also predict localization in 2d fractonic\ncircuits. Immobile fractonic charge emits non-conserved operators, whose\nspreading is governed by exponents distinct to non-fractonic circuits.\nFractonic operators exhibit a short time linear growth of observable\nentanglement with saturation to an area law, as well as a subthermal volume law\nfor operator entanglement.

On the base of\nseveral electoral events and assuming a stationary regime, we find out the\nfollowing: i) the maximization of the entropy singles out a microscopic model\n(single-Twitt-level) that coincides with a $q$-state Potts model having\nsuitable couplings and external fields to be determined via an inverse problem\nfrom the two sets of data; ii) correlations decay as $1/N_{eff}$, where\n$N_{eff}$ is a small fraction of the mean number of Twitts; iii) the simplest\nstatistical models that reproduce these correlations are the multinomial\ndistribution (MD), characterized by $q$ external fields, and the mean-field\nPotts model (MFP), characterized by one coupling; iv) remarkably, this coupling\nturns out to be always close to its critical value.

We study in detail the effect of a \\emph{single} chipping site on\nthe steady state in arbitrary dimensions, with and without bias. In the\nthermodynamic limit, the system can exist in one of the following phases -- (a)\nPinned Aggregate (PA) phase in which an infinite aggregate (with mass\nproportional to the volume of the system) appears with probability one at the\nchipping site but not in the bulk.

Abstract: The glass transition of supercooled fluids is a particular challenge for\ncomputer simulation, because the (longest) relaxation times increase by about\n15 decades upon approaching the transition temperature T_g. Brute-force\nmolecular dynamics simulations, as presented here for molten SiO_2 and\ncoarse-grained bead-spring models of polymer chains, can yield very useful\ninsight about the first few decades of this slowing down. Hence this allows to\naccess the temperature range around T_c of the so-called mode coupling theory,\nwhereas the dynamics around the experimental glass transition is completely out\nof reach. While methods such as ``parallel tempering'' improve the situation\nsomewhat, a method that allows to span a significant part of the region T_g\\leq\nT\\leq T_c is still lacking. Only for abstract models such as the infinite range\n10-state Potts glass with a few hundred spins this region can be explored.\nHowever this model suffers from very strong finite size effects thus making it\ndifficult to extrapolate the results obtained for the finite system sizes to\nthe thermodynamic limit. For the case of polymer melts, two different\nstrategies to use lattice models instead of continuum models are discussed: In\nthe first approach, a mapping of an atomistically realistic model of\npolyethylene to the bond fluctuation model with suitable effective potentials\nand a temperature-dependent time rescaling factor is attempted. In the second\napproach, devoted to a test of the entropy theory, moves that are artificial\nbut which lead to a faster relaxation (``slithering snake'' algorithm) are\nused, to get at least static properties at somewhat lower temperatures than\npossible with a ``realistic'' dynamics. The merits and shortcomings of all\nthese approaches are discussed. \n\n"}

In both cases the first two moments of the distribution are\nchosen to be J_0=-1, Delta J=+1, so that no ferromagnetic ordering of the Potts\nspins can occur. We find that for all temperatures investigated the spin glass\nsusceptibility remains finite, the spin glass order parameter remains zero, and\nthat the specific heat has only a smooth Schottky-like peak. These results can\nbe understood quantitatively by considering small but independent clusters of\nspins. Hence we have evidence that there is no static phase transition at any\nnonzero temperature. Consistent with these findings, only very minor size\neffects are observed, which implies that all correlation lengths of the models\nremain very short.

In contrast to Fisher's original\nmapping, this enables us to reformulate frustrated Ising models as dimer models\nwith positive weights and we illustrate this by providing a new solution of the\nfully frustrated Ising model on the square lattice. Finally, by means of the\nmodified mapping we show that a large class of three-dimensional Ising models\nare precisely equivalent, in the time continuum limit, to particular quantum\ndimer models. As Ising models in three dimensions are dual to Ising gauge\ntheories, this further yields an exact map between the latter and the quantum\ndimer models.

To investigate the dynamics we focus on events\n(\"jumps\") where a particle escapes the cage formed by its neighbors. Using\nsingle particle trajectories we define a jump by comparing for each particle\nits fluctuations with its changes in average position. We find two kinds of\njumps: \"reversible jumps,\" where a particle jumps back and forth between two or\nmore average positions, and \"irreversible jumps,\" where a particle does not\nreturn to any of its former average positions. For all investigated\ntemperatures both kinds of particles jump and both irreversible and reversible\njumps occur. With increasing temperature relaxation is enhanced by an\nincreasing number of jumps, and growing jump lengths in position and potential\nenergy. However, the waiting time between two successive jumps is independent\nof temperature. This temperature independence might be due to aging, which is\npresent in our system. The ratio of irreversible to reversible jumps is also\nincreasing with increasing temperature, which we interpret as a consequence of\nthe increased likelihood of changes in the cages, i.e. a blocking of the\n\"entrance\" back into the previous cage. A comparison of the fluctuations of\njumping particles and non-jumping particles indicates that jumping particles\nare more mobile even when not jumping. The jumps in energy normalized by their\nfluctuations are decreasing with increasing temperature, which is consistent\nwith relaxation being increasingly driven by thermal fluctuations. In\naccordance with subdiffusive behavior are the distributions of waiting times\nand jump lengths in position. \n\n"}

The theoretical part develops a picture of\nnon-equilibrium glassy dynamics recently introduced by the authors. Invoking\nthe concept of marginal stability, this theory links irreversible\n`intermittent' events, or `quakes' to thermal fluctuations of record magnitude.\nThe pivotal idea is that the largest energy barrier $b(t_w,T)$ surmounted prior\nto $t_w$ by thermal fluctuations at temperature $T$ determines the rate $r_q\n\\propto 1/t_w$ of the intermittent events occurring near $t_w$.

We revisit this results and use standard tests as well as\ndevelop a battery of new non-parametric and parametric tests (in particular\nwith stretched exponential (SE) distributions) to characterize the\ndistributions of empirical returns of financial time series, with application\nto the 100 years of daily return of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and over 1\nyears of 5-minutes returns of the Nasdaq Composite index. Based on the\ndiscovery that the SE distribution tends to the Pareto distribution in a\ncertain limit such that the Pareto (or power law) distribution can be\napproximated with any desired accuracy on an arbitrary interval by a suitable\nadjustment of the parameters of the SE distribution, we demonstrate that Wilks'\ntest of nested hypothesis still works for the non-exactly nested comparison\nbetween the SE and Pareto distributions.

Similar conclusions hold\nfor the log-Weibull model with respect to the Pareto distribution.

Different physical entropies, other than\nthe standard one, appear to be necessary in order to satisfactorily deal with\nsuch anomalies. One of such entropies is $S_q \\equiv k (1-\\int dx\n[f(x)]^q)/(1-q)$ (with $S_1=S_{BG}$), where the entropic index $q$ is a real\nparameter. It has been proposed as the basis for a generalization, referred to\nas {\\it nonextensive statistical mechanics}, of the $BG$ theory. $S_q$ shares\nwith $S_{BG}$ four remarkable properties, namely {\\it concavity} ($\\forall\nq>0$), {\\it Lesche-stability} ($\\forall q>0$), {\\it finiteness of the entropy\nproduction per unit time} ($q \\in \\Re$), and {\\it additivity} (for at least a\ncompact support of $q$ including $q=1$).

We show that these events are uniformly characterized by\nthe phenomenon of scale invariance, i.e., the frequency scales as an inverse\npower of the severity, P(x) ~ x^-alpha. We find that this property is a robust\nfeature of terrorism, persisting when we control for economic development of\nthe target country, the type of weapon used, and even for short time-scales.\nFurther, we show that the center of the distribution oscillates slightly with a\nperiod of roughly tau ~ 13 years, that there exist significant temporal\ncorrelations in the frequency of severe events, and that current models of\nevent incidence cannot account for these variations or the scale invariance\nproperty of global terrorism. Finally, we describe a simple toy model for the\ngeneration of these statistics, and briefly discuss its implications. \n\n"}

It also covers human sciences, because all\neconomics is ultimately driven by human decision. From this human factor,\neconophysics has no hope to achieve the status of an exact science, but it is\ninteresting to discover what can be achieved, discovering potential limits and\ntrying try to push further away these limits. A few data analysis techniques\nare described with emphasis on the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis ($DFA$) and\nthe Zipf Analysis Technique ($ZAT$). Information about the original data\naresketchy, but the data concerns mainly the foreign currency exchange market.\nThe robustness of the $DFA$ technique is underlined. Additional remarks are\ngiven for suggesting further work. Models about financial value evolutions are\nrecalled, again without going into elaborate work discussing typical agent\nbehaviors, but rather with hopefully sufficient information such that the basic\ningredients can be memorized before reading some of the vast literature on\nprice formation. Crashes being spectacular phenomena retain our attention and\ndo so through data analysis and basic intuitive models. A few statistical and\nmicroscopic models are outlined. \n\n"}

If the entire publication network is truncated\nto the first neighbors of an article (the n references that it makes and the m\ncitations that it receives), its creativity value becomes a simple function of\nn and m.

While data considered for physics studies are\nsubject to a careful understanding of error sources, such analysis are almost\nabsent in studies of voting process. As a way to test reliability in electoral\nprocesses we choose to investigate the July 2006 presidential election in\nMexico. We use records which appeared in the Programa de Resultados\nPreliminares, PREP, the program which offers electoral results as soon as they\nare captured. In order to contrast the results we used the congressional\nelection data-set and the July 2000 presidential record. We demonstrate the\nexistence of correlations in the percentage of votes and, we offer evidence of\nthe strong influence of the PRI in the curious results in the presidential\ncase. Distributions of errors in the data-sets are analyzed for all the\nelections and no large deviations were found.
