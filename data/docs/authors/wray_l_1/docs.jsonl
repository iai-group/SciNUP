The\nfundamental homogeneous-medium Green's tensor of electrodynamics is deduced\nfrom the field of a dipole. Based upon that a numerical procedure is presented\nto solve the wave-equation for the near-field in a scattering setup for\narbitrary material distributions. The full inhomogeneous system's Green's\nfunction is not explicitly needed to get the fields, although it can be\nobtained by a very similar calculation and in optics can be interpreted as a\ndensity of states. It is demonstrated how the transport problem for two open\nfree-electron gas reservoirs with arbitrary coupling can be solved by finding\nthe system's Green's function. In this sense the article is an introduction on\nGreen's functions for treating interaction. A very detailed discussion of the\ncurrent formula is given on an elementary basis. \n\n"}

Using the recipe, we\nderive an expression for the persistent current in a 1D ring made of an\ninsulator with an arbitrary valence band E(k). To find an exact result for a\nspecific insulator, we consider a 1D ring represented by a periodic lattice of\nN identical sites with a single value of the on-site energy. If the Bloch\nstates in the ring are expanded over a complete set of N on-site Wannier\nfunctions, the discrete on-site energy splits into the energy band. At full\nfilling, the band emulates the valence band of the band insulator and the ring\nis insulating. It carries a persistent current equal to the product of N and\nthe derivative of the on-site energy with respect to the magnetic flux. This\ncurrent is not zero if one takes into account that the on-site Wannier function\nand consequently the on-site energy of each ring site depend on magnetic flux.\nTo derive the current analytically, we expand all N Wannier functions of the\nring over the infinite basis of Wannier functions of the constituting infinite\n1D crystal and eventually determine the crystal Wannier functions by a method\nof localized atomic orbitals. Finally, we estimate the persistent current at\nfull filling in rings made of real band insulators (GaAs, Ge, InAs). The\ncurrent decays with the ring length exponentially due to the exponential decay\nof the Wannier functions. In spite of that, it can be of measurable size. \n\n"}

With\nincreasing on-site repulsion $U$, the system develops successively\nferromagnetism, intra unit-cell antiferromagnetism, and charge bond order. With\nnearest-neighbor Coulomb interaction $V$ alone (U=0), the system develops\nintra-unit-cell charge density wave order for small $V$, s-wave\nsuperconductivity for moderate $V$, and the charge density wave order appears\nagain for even larger $V$.

It was recently predicted that, by tuning the two Zeeman fields, the\nsystem may exhibit different exotic Fulde-Ferrell (FF) superfluid phases,\nincluding the gapped FF, gapless FF, gapless topological FF and gapped\ntopological FF states. Due to the FF paring, we show that the superfluid\ndensity (tensor) of the system becomes anisotropic. When an in-plane Zeeman\nfield is applied along the \\textit{x}-direction, the tensor component along the\n\\textit{y}-direction $n_{s,yy}$ is generally larger than $n_{s,xx}$ in most\nparameter space. At zero temperature, there is always a discontinuity jump in\n$n_{s,xx}$ as the system evolves from a gapped FF into a gapless FF state.

Depending on the gate bias, ion implanted n$^+$ and p$^+$\nregions function either as Ohmic contacts or as in-plane gates, which laterally\nconfine the carriers induced by the global gate. On one device, electron and\nhole densities of up to $7.8\\times10^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $7.6\\times10^{11}$\ncm$^{-2}$ respectively are obtained. The peak electron mobility is\n$1.76\\times10^5$ cm$^{2}$/Vs, and the peak hole mobility is $9.1\\times10^3$\ncm$^{2}$/Vs at 300 mK; the ratio of about 20 is mainly due to the very\ndifferent valley degeneracies (6:1) of electrons and holes on the Si(111)\nsurface.

The most striking result is that\neven without impurities the Fermi surface term, a non-Berry-curvature term,\nplays dominant roles at high or slightly low temperatures.

The phase diagram contains a non-Fermi liquid fixed\npoint separating a screened phase, where conventional Kondo effect occurs, from\nan unscreened one, where the exchange-splitting takes care of quenching the\nimpurity degrees of freedom. On the Kondo screened side close to this fixed\npoint the impurity density of states shows a narrow Kondo-peak on top of a\nbroader resonance. This narrow peak transforms in the unscreened phase into a\nnarrow pseudo-gap inside the broad resonance. Right at the fixed point only the\nlatter survives. The fixed point is therefore identified by a jump of the\ndensity of states at the chemical potential. We also show that particle-hole\nperturbations which simply shift the orbital energies do not wash out the fixed\npoint, unlike those perturbations which hybridize the two orbitals.\nConsequently the density-of-state jump at the chemical potential remains finite\neven away from particle-hole symmetry, and the pseudo-gap stays pinned at the\nchemical potential, although it is partially filled in. We also discuss the\nrelevance of these results for lattice models which map onto this Anderson\nimpurity model in the limit of large lattice-coordination.

A variety of experiments are discussed, focusing on the region\nof the phase diagram close to the Mott insulator (the underdoped region) where\nthe behavior is most anomalous. We introduce Anderson's idea of the resonating\nvalence bond (RVB) and argue that it gives a qualitative account of the data.\nThe importance of phase fluctuation is discussed, leading to a theory of the\ntransition temperature which is driven by phase fluctuation and thermal\nexcitation of quasiparticles. We then describe the numerical method of\nprojected wavefunction which turns out to be a very useful technique to\nimplement the strong correlation constraint, and leads to a number of\npredictions which are in agreement with experiments. The remainder of the paper\ndeals with an analytic treatment of the t-J model, with the goal of putting the\nRVB idea on a more formal footing.

The SC pairing strength is found to be\nconsistent with a weak-coupling regime except in the under-doped region where\nwe observe an in-gap collective mode at 4.5 k_{B}T_c while the maximum\namplitude of the SC gap is ~8 k_{B}T_{c}. In the normal state, doped carriers\ndivide into coherent quasi-particles (QPs) and carriers that remain incoherent.\nThe coherent QPs mainly reside in the vicinity of (\\pi/2, \\pi/2) regions of the\nBrillouin zone (BZ). We find that only coherent QPs contribute to the\nsuperfluid density in the B_{2g} channel.

The focus of our\nattention lies on the superconducting properties. We report in agreement with\nthe square Hubbard model a signal in the d-wave channel and investigate its\ndependence on system size, cluster shape and interaction strength. \n\n"}
{"id": "math-ph/0402045", "contents": "Title: Ferromagnetic Domain Wall Ground States in One-Dimensional Deformed\n  Flat-Band Hubbard Model Abstract: We construct a set of exact ground states with a localized ferromagnetic\ndomain wall and an extended spiral structure in a quasi-one-dimensional\ndeformed flat-band Hubbard model. In the case of quarter filling, we show the\nuniqueness of the ground state with a fixed magnetization. The ground states\nwith these structures are degenerate with the all-spin-up and all-spin-down\nstates. This property of the degeneracy is the same as the domain wall\nsolutions in the XXZ Heisenberg-Ising model. We derive a useful recursion\nrelation for the normalization of the domain wall ground state. Using this\nrecursion relation, we discuss the convergence of the ground state expectation\nvalues of arbitrary local operators in the infinite-volume limit. In the ground\nstate of the infinite-volume system, the translational symmetry is\nspontaneously broken by this structure. We prove that the cluster property\nholds for the domain wall ground state and excited states. We also estimate\nbounds of the ground state expectation values of several observables, such as\none- and two-point functions of spin and electron number density. \n\n"}

The structure of these CPT-like states\ncorresponds to Cooper pairs with the total spin $S$=1. The found states have a\nhuge degree of degeneracy and carry a macroscopic magnetic moment, that allows\nus to construct a new model of the magnetism connected with the delocalized\nelectrons in metals (conductors). A principal possibility to apply the obtained\nresults to the superfluid $^3$He is also demonstrated. \n\n"}
