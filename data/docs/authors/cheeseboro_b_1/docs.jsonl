One of the most likely sources of\nisotropic EM emission from compact object mergers is a supernova-like transient\npowered by the radioactive decay of heavy elements synthesized in ejecta from\nthe merger.

A SMBHB in the\nrange 2x 10^(8) - 2 x 10^(9) solar masses (the masses are normalised to a (1+z)\nfactor, the red shift lying between z = 0.2 and z=1.5) moves from the PTA-SKA\nto the SLI band over a period ranging from two months to fifty years. By\ncombining three Super Massive Black Hole (SMBH)-host relations with three\naccretion prescriptions, nine astrophysical scenarios are formed. They are then\nrelated to three levels of pulsar timing residuals (50, 5, 1 ns), generating\ntwenty-seven cases. For residuals of 1 ns, sequential detection probability\nwill never be better than 4.7 x 10^(-4) y^(-2) or 3.3 x 10^(-6) y^(-2) (per\nyear to merger and per year of survey), according to the best and worst\nastrophysical scenarios, respectively; put differently this means one\nsequential detection every 46 or 550 years for an equivalent maximum time to\nmerger and duration of the survey. The chances of sequential detection are\nfurther reduced by increasing values of the s parameter (they vanish for s =\n10) and of the SLI noise, and by decreasing values of the remnant spin.

We model NS matter by systematically\nparametrized piecewise polytropic equations of state. The initial condition is\ncomputed in the puncture framework adopting an isolated horizon framework to\nestimate the BH spin and assuming an irrotational velocity field for the fluid\ninside the NS. Dynamical simulations are performed in full general relativity\nby an adaptive mesh refinement code, SACRA. The treatment of hydrodynamic\nequations and estimation of the disk mass are improved. We find that the NS is\ntidally disrupted irrespective of the mass ratio when the BH has a moderately\nlarge prograde spin, whereas only binaries with low mass ratios, MBH/MNS <~ 3\nor small compactnesses of the NSs, bring the tidal disruption when the BH spin\nis zero or retrograde. The mass of the remnant disk is accordingly large as >~\n0.1 Msun, which is required by central engines of short gamma-ray bursts, if\nthe BH spin is prograde. Information of the tidal disruption is reflected in a\nclear relation between the compactness of the NS and an appropriately defined\n\"cutoff frequency\" in the gravitational-wave spectrum, above which the spectrum\ndamps exponentially. We find that the tidal disruption of the NS and excitation\nof the quasinormal mode of the remnant BH occur in a compatible manner in high\nmass-ratio binaries with the prograde BH spin. The correlation between the\ncompactness and the cutoff frequency still holds for such cases. It is also\nsuggested by extrapolation that the merger of an extremely spinning BH and an\nirrotational NS binary does not lead to formation of an overspinning BH. \n\n"}

A transient astrophysical event observed in both gravitational wave\n(GW) and electromagnetic (EM) channels would yield rich scientific rewards. A\nfirst program initiating EM follow-ups to possible transient GW events has been\ndeveloped and exercised by the LIGO and Virgo community in association with\nseveral partners. In this paper, we describe and evaluate the methods used to\npromptly identify and localize GW event candidates and to request images of\ntargeted sky locations.\n  Methods. During two observing periods (Dec 17 2009 to Jan 8 2010 and Sep 2 to\nOct 20 2010), a low-latency analysis pipeline was used to identify GW event\ncandidates and to reconstruct maps of possible sky locations. A catalog of\nnearby galaxies and Milky Way globular clusters was used to select the most\npromising sky positions to be imaged, and this directional information was\ndelivered to EM observatories with time lags of about thirty minutes.

For signals near the detection threshold, our low-latency algorithms\noften localized simulated GW burst signals to tens of square degrees, while\nneutron star/neutron star inspirals and neutron star/black hole inspirals were\nlocalized to a few hundred square degrees.

The\nspectrum found shows a number of peculiar features, which are absent in the\nMinkowski space-time. A hypothetical particle that moves faster than light,\n\\emph{a tachyon}, is known to be classically unstable in the Minkowski\nspace-time. This instability has its analog at the quantum level: small vacuum\nfluctuations of the field lead to the unbounded growth of the amplitude, so\nthat the appearance of the real tachyons in the spectrum means that there is\ncatastrophic instability in the theory.

The traditional general-relativistic Dirac\nequation (1929) is based on the parallel transported spinors and does not\nensure the correspondent transition. Second, because in the range of very high\nvelocity (close to the speed of light) of a spinning particle relative to the\nSchwarzschild or Kerr sources the Mathisson-Papapetrou equations have the\nsolutions which reveal that the spin-gravity interaction acts as a strong\nantigravity force, we suppose that this fact can be useful for explanation some\nastrophysical phenomena.

In the first approach (which could\nbe called extrinsic) we use a procedure motivated by earlier work by Pretorius,\nVollick and Israel, and by Oppenheim, and evaluate the entropy of a\nconfiguration of densely packed gravitating shells on the verge of forming a\nblack hole in Lanczos-Lovelock theories of gravity. We find that this matter\nentropy is not equal to (it is less than) Wald entropy, except in the case of\nEinstein theory, where they are equal. The matter entropy is proportional to\nthe Wald entropy if we consider a specific m-th order Lanczos-Lovelock model,\nwith the proportionality constant depending on the spacetime dimensions D and\nthe order m of the Lanczos-Lovelock theory as (D-2m)/(D-2). Since the\nproportionality constant depends on m, the proportionality between matter\nentropy and Wald entropy breaks down when we consider a sum of Lanczos-Lovelock\nactions involving different m. In the second approach (which could be called\nintrinsic) we generalize a procedure, previously introduced by Padmanabhan in\nthe context of GR, to study off-shell entropy of a class of metrics with\nhorizon using a path integral method.

In this approach, a fully general\nrelativistic magnetohydrodynamics implementation models the collapse of the\nstar and provides appropriate boundary conditions to a force-free model which\ndescribes the stellar exterior. We validate this strategy by comparing with\nknown results for the rotating monopole and aligned rotator solutions and then\napply it to study both rotating and non-rotating stellar collapse scenarios,\nand contrast the behavior with what is obtained when employing the\nelectrovacuum approximation outside the star. The non-rotating electrovacuum\ncollapse is shown to agree qualitatively with a Newtonian model of the\nelectromagnetic field outside a collapsing star. We illustrate and discuss a\nfundamental difference between the force-free and electrovacuum solutions,\ninvolving the appearance of large zones of electric-dominated field in the\nvacuum case. This provides a clear demonstration of how dissipative\nsingularities appear generically in the non-linear time-evolution of force-free\nfluids.

The long-duration gravitational-waveforms emitted\nby such systems encode the structure of the strong field region of the massive\nblack hole, in which the inspiral occurs. The detection and analysis of EMRIs\nwill therefore allow us to study the geometry of massive black holes and\ndetermine whether their nature is as predicted by General Relativity and even\nto test whether General Relativity is the correct theory to describe the\ndynamics of these systems. To achieve this, EMRI modeling in alternative\ntheories of gravity is required to describe the generation of gravitational\nwaves. In this paper, we explore to what extent EMRI observations with LISA or\neLISA/NGO might be able to distinguish between General Relativity and a\nparticular modification of it, known as Dynamical Chern-Simons Modified\nGravity. Our analysis is based on a parameter estimation study that uses\napproximate gravitational waveforms obtained via a radiative-adiabatic method\nand is restricted to a five-dimensional subspace of the EMRI configuration\nspace. This includes a Chern-Simons parameter that controls the strength of\ngravitational deviations from General Relativity. We find that, if Dynamical\nChern-Simons Modified Gravity is the correct theory, an observatory like LISA\nor even eLISA/NGO should be able to measure the Chern-Simons parameter with\nfractional errors below 5%. If General Relativity is the true theory, these\nobservatories should put bounds on this parameter at the level xi^(1/4) < 10^4\nkm, which is four orders of magnitude better than current Solar System bounds. \n\n"}

In order to confirm the Kerr-nature of these\nobjects, we need to probe the geometry of the space-time around them and see if\nthe observations are consistent with the predictions of the Kerr metric. That\ncan be achieved, for instance, by studying the properties of the\nelectromagnetic radiation emitted by the gas in the accretion disk. The\nhigh-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations observed in the X-ray flux of some\nstellar-mass black hole candidates might do the job. As the frequencies of\nthese oscillations depend only very weakly on the observed X-ray flux, it is\nthought they are mainly determined by the metric of the space-time. In this\npaper, I consider the resonance models proposed by Abramowicz and Kluzniak and\nI extend previous results to the case of non-Kerr space-times. The emerging\npicture is more complicated than the one around a Kerr black hole and there is\na larger number of possible combinations between different modes. I then\ncompare the bounds inferred from the twin peak high-frequency quasi-periodic\noscillations observed in three micro-quasars (GRO J1655-40, XTE J1550-564, and\nGRS 1915+105) with the measurements from the continuum-fitting method of the\nsame objects.

Following recent theoretical models of wind mass loss and core\ncollapse supernovae, we assume that the mass of the stellar remnants depends on\nthe metallicity of the progenitor stars.

Several mysteries cloud the interpretation\nof this event: (1) extreme flaring and `plateau' shape of the X-ray/gamma-ray\nlight curve during the first 10 days after the gamma-ray trigger; (2)\nunexpected rebrightening of the forward shock radio emission months after\ntrigger; (3) no obvious evidence for jet precession, despite misalignment\ntypically expected between the angular momentum of the accretion disk and BH;\n(4) recent abrupt shut-off in jet X-ray emission after 1.5 years. Here we show\nthat all of these seemingly disparate mysteries are naturally resolved by one\nassumption: the presence of strong magnetic flux Phi threading the BH.\nInitially, Phi is weak relative to high fall-back mass accretion rate, Mdot,\nand the disk and jets precess about the BH axis = our line of sight. As Mdot\ndrops, Phi becomes dynamically important and leads to a magnetically-arrested\ndisk (MAD). MAD naturally aligns disk and jet axis along the BH spin axis, but\nonly after a violent rearrangement phase (jet wobbling). This explains the\nerratic light curve at early times and the lack of precession at later times.\nWe use our model for Swift J1644+57 to constrain BH and disrupted star\nproperties, finding that a solar-mass main sequence star disrupted by a\nrelatively low mass, M~10^5-10^6 Msun, BH is consistent with the data, while a\nWD disruption (though still possible) is disfavored.

Besides clustering in halos, the universal character of gravity\nimplies that self-gravitating compact DM configurations might be spread\nthroughout the universe. The astrophysical signature of these objects may be\nused to probe fundamental particle physics, or even to provide an alternative\ndescription of compact objects in active galactic nuclei. Here we discuss the\nmost promising dissection tool of these configurations: the inspiral of a\ncompact stellar-size object and consequent gravitational-wave emission. The\ninward motion of this \"test probe\" encodes unique information about the nature\nof the central, supermassive DM configuration. When the probe travels through\nsome compact DM profile we show that, within a Newtonian approximation, the\nquasi-adiabatic evolution of the inspiral is mainly driven by DM accretion into\nthe small compact object and by dynamical friction, rather than by\ngravitational-wave radiation-reaction. These effects circularize the orbits and\nleave a peculiar imprint on the gravitational waves emitted at late time. When\naccretion dominates, the frequency and the amplitude of the gravitational-wave\nsignal produced during the latest stages of the inspiral are nearly constant.\nIn the exterior region we study a relativistic model in which the inspiral is\ndriven by the emission of gravitational and scalar waves. Resonances in the\nenergy flux appear whenever the orbital frequency matches the mass of the DM\nparticle and they correspond to the excitation of the central object's\nquasinormal frequencies. Unexpectedly, these resonances can lead to large\ndephasing with respect to standard inspiral templates, to such an extent as to\nprevent detection with matched filtering techniques. We discuss some\nobservational consequences of these effects for gravitational-wave detection. \n\n"}

However, off-center\ntidal flares can also be produced by SMBHs in merging galaxies.

We employ an analytical model to\ncalculate the tidal loss-cone feeding rates for both SMBHs, taking into account\ntwo-body relaxation of stars, tidal perturbations by the companion galaxy, and\nchaotic stellar orbits in triaxial gravitational potential. We show that for\ntypical SMBHs with mass 10^7 M_\\sun, the loss-cone feeding rates are enhanced\nby mergers up to \\Gamma ~ 10^{-2} yr^{-1}, about two order of magnitude higher\nthan those by single SMBHs in isolated galaxies and about four orders of\nmagnitude higher than those by recoiling SMBHs.

Previous studies indicate that these models should be adequate\nfor gravitational-wave detection. In this paper we focus on the systematic\nbiases that would result from using them to estimate binary parameters, and\nconsider a one-parameter family of configurations at one choice of mass ratio\nand effective single spin. We find that for low-mass binaries within that\nfamily of configurations, where the observable waveform is dominated by the\ninspiral, the systematic bias in all physical parameters is smaller than the\nparameter uncertainty due to degeneracies between the mass ratio and the spins,\nat least up to signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of 50. For higher-mass binaries,\nwhere the merger and ringdown make a greater contribution to the observed\nsignal, the bias in the mass ratio is comparable to its uncertainty at SNRs of\nonly $\\sim$30, and the bias in the measurement of the total spin is\n\\emph{larger} than the uncertainty defined by the 90% confidence region even at\nan SNR of only 10. Although this bias may be mitigated in future models by a\nbetter choice of single-effective-spin parameter, these results suggest that it\nmay be possible to accurately measure \\emph{both} black-hole spins in\nintermediate-mass binaries. \n\n"}

Among\npossible EM emission from the NS merger, emission powered by radioactive\nr-process nuclei is one of the best targets for follow-up observations.\nHowever, prediction so far does not take into account detailed r-process\nelement abundances in the ejecta. We perform radiative transfer simulations for\nthe NS merger ejecta including all the r-process elements from Ga to U for the\nfirst time. We show that the opacity in the NS merger ejecta is about kappa =\n10 cm^2 g^{-1}, which is higher than that of Fe-rich Type Ia supernova ejecta\nby a factor of ~ 100. As a result, the emission is fainter and longer than\npreviously expected. The spectra are almost featureless due to the high\nexpansion velocity and bound-bound transitions of many different r-process\nelements. We demonstrate that the emission is brighter for a higher mass ratio\nof two NSs and a softer equation of states adopted in the merger simulations.\nBecause of the red color of the emission, follow-up observations in red optical\nand near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths will be the most efficient. At 200 Mpc,\nexpected brightness of the emission is i = 22 - 25 AB mag, z = 21 - 23 AB mag,\nand 21 - 24 AB mag in NIR JHK bands. Thus, observations with wide-field 4m- and\n8m-class optical telescopes and wide-field NIR space telescopes are necessary.\nWe also argue that the emission powered by radioactive energy can be detected\nin the afterglow of nearby short gamma-ray bursts. \n\n"}

The templates map the waveform shapes to physical\nparameters, thus allowing us to produce posterior probability distributions for\nthese parameters. However, there are attendant dangers in using highly\nrestrictive signal priors. If strong field gravity is not accurately described\nby General Relativity (GR), then using GR templates may result in fundamental\nbias in the recovered parameters, or even worse, a complete failure to detect\nsignals. Here we study such dangers, concentrating on three distinct\npossibilities. First, we show that there exist modified theories compatible\nwith all existing tests that would fail to be detected by the LIGO/Virgo\nnetwork using searches based on GR templates, but which would be detected using\na one parameter post-Einsteinian extension. Second, we study modified theories\nthat produce departures from GR that turn on suddenly at a critical frequency,\nproducing waveforms that do not naively fit into the simplest parameterized\npost-Einsteinian (ppE) scheme. We show that even the simplest ppE templates are\nstill capable of picking up these strange signals and diagnosing a departure\nfrom GR.

In this study, we use a non-periodic\ncomputational box, the jet flow is initially established across the\ncomputational grid, and a precessional perturbation at the inlet triggers\ngrowth of the kink instability. If the velocity shear radius is located inside\nthe characteristic radius of the helical magnetic field, a static\nnon-propagating current driven kink is excited as the perturbation propagates\ndown the jet. Temporal growth disrupts the initial flow across the\ncomputational grid not too far from the inlet. On the other hand, if the\nvelocity shear radius is outside the characteristic radius of the helical\nmagnetic field, the kink is advected with the flow and grows spatially down the\njet. In this case flow is maintained to much larger distances from the inlet.\nThe effect of different radial density profiles is more subtle. When the\ndensity increases with radius, the kink appears to saturate by the end of the\nsimulation without apparent disruption of the helical twist. This behavior\nsuggests that relativistic jets consisting of a tenuous spine surrounded by a\ndenser medium with a velocity shear radius outside the radius of maximum\ntoroidal magnetic field have a relatively stable configuration. \n\n"}

If correct, this result has important\nconsequences: objects with a light ring are black holes. In other words, the\nnonlinear instability of ultracompact stars would provide a strong argument in\nfavor of the \"black hole hypothesis,\" once electromagnetic or\ngravitational-wave observations confirm the existence of light rings.

The sensitivity of such cross-correlation analyses depends, among\nother things, on the separation between the two detectors: the smaller the\nseparation, the better the sensitivity. Hence, a co-located detector pair is\nmore sensitive to a gravitational-wave background than a non-co-located\ndetector pair. However, co-located detectors are also expected to suffer from\ncorrelated noise from instrumental and environmental effects that could\ncontaminate the measurement of the background. Hence, methods to identify and\nmitigate the effects of correlated noise are necessary to achieve the potential\nincrease in sensitivity of co-located detectors. Here we report on the first\nSGWB analysis using the two LIGO Hanford detectors and address the\ncomplications arising from correlated environmental noise. We apply correlated\nnoise identification and mitigation techniques to data taken by the two LIGO\nHanford detectors, H1 and H2, during LIGO's fifth science run.

Studies of\npulsars demonstrate that their electromagnetic (EM) emissions suffer from\n\\emph{timing noise}, small deviations in the phase from Taylor expansion\nmodels. How the mechanism producing EM emission is related to any continuous\ngravitational-wave (CW) emission is unknown; if they either interact or are\nlocked in phase then the CW will also experience timing noise. Any disparity\nbetween the signal and the search template used in matched filtering methods\nwill result in a loss of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), referred to as\n`mismatch'.

Light curves and images of hot spots orbiting a black\nhole are affected by a number of special and general relativistic effects, and\nthey can be potentially used to check whether the object is a Kerr black hole\nof general relativity. However, in a previous study we have shown that the\nrelativistic features are usually subdominant with respect to the background\nnoise and the model-dependent properties of the hot spot, and eventually it is\nat most possible to estimate the frequency of the innermost stable circular\norbit. In this case, tests of the Kerr metric are only possible in combination\nwith other measurements. In the present work, we consider a class of non-Kerr\nspacetimes in which the hot spot orbit may be outside the equatorial plane.\nThese metrics are difficult to constrain from the study of accretion disks and\nindeed current X-ray observations of stellar-mass and supermassive black hole\ncandidates cannot put interesting bounds.

This\nsecondary peak is typically well separated in frequency from the secondary peak\nproduced by a nonlinear interaction between a quadrupole and a quasi-radial\noscillation. The new mechanism allows for an explanation of low-frequency\nmodulations seen in a number of physical characteristics of the remnant, such\nas the central lapse function, the maximum density and the separation between\nthe two cores.

In most cases, the combined effects of magnetic torques and IGW\nAM transport likely lead to substantially longer rotation periods. However, the\nstochastic influx of AM delivered by IGW during shell burning phases inevitably\nspin up a slowly rotating stellar core, leading to a maximum possible core\nrotation period.

The maximum\nBH mass found with SEVN is $\\sim{}$25, 60 and 130 M$_{\\odot}$ at metallicity $Z\n=2 \\times{} 10^{-2}$ , $2 \\times{}10^{-3}$ and $2\\times{} 10^{-4}$ ,\nrespectively. Mass loss by stellar winds plays a major role in determining the\nmass of BHs for very massive stars ($\\geq{}90$ M$_\\odot{}$), while the remnant\nmass spectrum depends mostly on the adopted SN recipe for lower progenitor\nmasses. We discuss the implications of our results for the transition between\nNS and BH mass, and for the expected number of massive BHs (with mass $>25$\nM$_\\odot{}$) as a function of metallicity. \n\n"}

For all the disk-to-black hole mass ratios\nconsidered (0.044-0.16) we observe significant black hole precession and\nnutation during the evolution. This indicates that for such mass ratios,\nneglecting the self-gravity of the disks by evolving them in a fixed background\nblack hole spacetime is not justified. We find that the two more massive models\nare unstable against the Papaloizou-Pringle (PP) instability and that those\nPP-unstable models remain unstable for all initial spins and tilt angles\nconsidered, showing that the development of the instability is a very robust\nfeature of such PP-unstable disks. Our lightest model, which is the most\nastrophysically favorable outcome of mergers of binary compact objects, is\nstable. The tilt between the black hole spin and the disk is strongly modulated\nduring the growth of the PP instability, causing a partial global realignment\nof black hole spin and disk angular momentum in the most massive model with\nconstant specific angular momentum l.

A natural question is whether the same relations hold for\ndifferent compact objects and how they possibly approach the black-hole limit.\nHere we consider \"gravastars\", which are hypothetical compact objects sustained\nby their internal vacuum energy. Such solutions have been proposed as exotic\nalternatives to the black-hole paradigm because they can be as compact as black\nholes and exist in any mass range. By constructing slowly-rotating, thin-shell\ngravastars to quadratic order in the spin, we compute the moment of inertia\n$I$, the mass quadrupole moment $Q$, and the tidal Love number $\\lambda$ in\nexact form.

We firstly\ndemonstrate non-perturbative gravitino mass generation via this mechanism in\nflat spacetime, and from this derive the condensate mode wavefunction\nrenormalisation. By then calculating the full canonically normalised one-loop\neffective potential for the condensate mode about a de Sitter background, we\ndemonstrate that, contrary to claims in the literature, this process may both\noccur and function in a phenomenologically viable manner. In particular, we\nfind that outside of certain unfortunate gauge choices, the stability of the\ncondensate is intimately tied via gravitational degrees of freedom to the sign\nof the tree-level cosmological constant. Furthermore, we find that the energy\ndensity liberated may provide the necessary inflation of the early universe via\nan effective scalar degree of freedom, provided by the condensate, acting as\nthe inflaton.

There is\nconsiderable interest in searching for their faint and rapidly fading\nelectromagnetic (EM) counterparts, though GW position uncertainties are as\ncoarse as hundreds of square degrees. Because LIGO's sensitivity to binary\nneutron stars is limited to the local universe, the area on the sky that must\nbe searched could be reduced by weighting positions by mass, luminosity, or\nstar formation in nearby galaxies.

The LIGO Scientific Collaboration\nand the Virgo Collaboration have verified that this observation is consistent\nwith General Relativity. This paper expands their analysis to a larger class of\nanomalies, highlighting the inferences that can be drawn on non-standard\ntheoretical physics mechanisms.

Though other observations limit many of these mechanisms already,\nGW150914 and GW151226 are unique in that they are direct probes of dynamical\nstrong-field gravity and of gravitational wave propagation. We also show that\nGW150914 constrains inferred properties of exotic compact object alternatives\nto Kerr black holes.

We also deduce the exact\nLense-Thirring (LT) precession frequency of a test gyroscope moving toward a\nrotating traversable Teo wormhole. The precession frequency diverges on the\nergoregion, a behavior intimately related to and governed by the geometry of\nthe ergoregion, analogous to the situation in a Kerr spacetime. Interestingly,\nit turns out that here the LT precession is inversely proportional to the\nangular momentum ($a$) of the wormhole along the pole and around it in the\nstrong gravity regime, a behavior contrasting with its direct variation with\n$a$ in the case of other compact objects. In fact, divergence of LT precession\ninside the ergoregion can also be avoided if the gyro moves with a non-zero\nangular velocity in a certain range. As a result, the spin precession frequency\nof the gyro can be made finite throughout its whole path, even very close to\nthe throat, during its travel to the wormhole.

If so, PBHs would add a Poissonian isocurvature density\nfluctuation component to the inflation-produced adiabatic density fluctuations.\nFor LIGO's BH parameters, this extra component would dominate the small-scale\npower responsible for collapse of early DM halos at z>10, where first luminous\nsources formed. We quantify the resultant increase in high-z abundances of\ncollapsed halos that are suitable for producing the first generation of stars\nand luminous sources. The significantly increased abundance of the early halos\nwould naturally explain the observed source-subtracted near-IR cosmic infrared\nbackground (CIB) fluctuations, which cannot be accounted for by known galaxy\npopulations. For LIGO's BH parameters this increase is such that the observed\nCIB fluctuation levels at 2 to 5 micron can be produced if only a tiny fraction\nof baryons in the collapsed DM halos forms luminous sources.

Including contemporary schemes for\nstellar wind and remnant-formation, such model clusters are evolved, for the\nfirst time, using the state-of-the-art direct N-body evolution program NBODY7,\nuntil their dissolution or at least for 10 Gyr. That way, a self-regulatory\nbehaviour in the effects of dynamical interactions among the BHs, especially\nwhile heating and expanding the cluster and self-depleting the BHs, is\ndemonstrated. The BBH mergers obtained here show a prominence in\ntriple-mediated mergers while being bound to the clusters, compared to those\noccurring among the BBHs that are dynamically ejected from the clusters. This\nis in contrast with earlier N-body computations and also with recent\nMonte-Carlo method based ones. A broader mass spectrum of BHs and ejection of\nBBHs generally of wider orbits and in lower numbers, for the cluster masses\nexplored here, might cause this which is yet to be fully understood. Among the\nBBH coalescences obtained here, there are ones that resemble the detected\nGW151226, LVT151012, and GW150914 events and also ones which are even more\nmassive.

Such events would be\nobservationally indistinguishable from neutral current deep-inelastic\nscattering events due to neutrinos. Consequently, one reason for deviations,\nbreaks or excesses in the expected astrophysical power-law neutrino spectrum\ncould be the flux of such a particle.

Simulating a BBH coalescence\nby solving Einstein's equations numerically is computationally expensive,\nrequiring days to months of computing resources for a single set of parameter\nvalues. Since theoretical predictions of the GWs are often needed for many\ndifferent source parameters, a fast and accurate model is essential. We present\nthe first surrogate model for GWs from the coalescence of BBHs including all\n$7$ dimensions of the intrinsic non-eccentric parameter space.

We find that for canonical NSs (with mass M =\n1.4M_sun and radius R = 10 km) and modest rotation rates (< 300 Hz), the\ngravitational wave phase shift due to a resonance is generally less than 0.01\nradian. But the phase shift is a strong function of R and M, and can reach a\nradian or more for low-mass NSs with larger radii (R > 15 km). Significant\nphase shift can also be produced when the combination of stratification and\nrotation gives rise to a very low frequency (< 20 Hz in the inertial frame)\nmodified g-mode. We also find that some inertial modes can be strongly affected\nby stratification, and that the m = 1 r-mode, previously identified to have a\nsmall but finite inertial-frame frequency based on the Cowling approximation,\nin fact has essentially zero frequency, and therefore cannot be excited. \n\n"}

Outflows from these neutrino-cooled\naccretion disks represent an important site for $r$-process nucleosynthesis and\nthe generation of kilonovae. We present the first three-dimensional,\ngeneral-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations including weak\ninteractions and a realistic equation of state of such accretion disks over\nviscous timescales ($380\\,\\mathrm{ms}$). We witness the emergence of\nsteady-state MHD turbulence, a magnetic dynamo with an $\\sim\\!20\\,\\mathrm{ms}$\ncycle, and the generation of a `hot' disk corona that launches powerful thermal\noutflows aided by the energy released as free nucleons recombine into\n$\\alpha$-particles. We identify a self-regulation mechanism that keeps the\nmidplane electron fraction low ($Y_e\\sim0.1$) over viscous timescales. This\nneutron-rich reservoir, in turn, feeds outflows that retain a sufficiently low\nvalue of $Y_e\\approx 0.2$ to robustly synthesize third-peak $r$-process\nelements. The quasi-spherical outflows are projected to unbind $40\\%$ of the\ninitial disk mass with typical asymptotic escape velocities of $0.1c$, and may\nthus represent the dominant mass ejection mechanism in NS-NS mergers.

Here we find that\nthe first six binary black hole (BBH) merging events reported by LIGO/Virgo\nshow clear evidence for lensing in the plane of observed mass and source\ndistance. The four lowest frequency events follow an apparent locus in this\nplane, which we can reproduce by galaxy lensing, where the higher the\nmagnification, the generally more distant the source so the wave train is\nstretched more by the Universal expansion, by factors of 2-4. This revises the\nreported BBH distances upwards by an order of magnitude, equal to the square\nroot of the magnification. Furthermore, the reported black hole masses must be\ndecreased by 2-4 to counter the larger stretch factor, since the orbital\nfrequency is used to derive the black hole masses. This lowers the masses to\n5-15 solar masses, well below the puzzlingly high values of 20-35 solar masses\notherwise estimated, with the attraction of finding agreement in mass with\nblack holes orbiting stars in our own Galaxy, thereby implying a stellar origin\nfor the low frequency events in the far Universe.

Using the single-orbital-averaged\nand double-orbital-averaged secular dynamics equations of triples, we determine\nthe merger window (the range of companion inclinations that allows the inner\nbinary to merge) and the merger fraction as a function of various system\nparameters. For typical BH binaries, the merger fraction increases rapidly with\nthe perturber eccentricity $e_{\\rm out}$ because of the octupole perturbation,\nreaching $10-20\\%$ at $e_{\\rm out}=0.9$. We derive the analytical expressions\nfor the merger window and merger fraction for systems with negligible octupole\neffect, and apply them to neutron star binary mergers in triples.

Notably, Planck cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB) and the local Cepheid-supernovae distance ladder\nmeasurements determine $H_0$ with a precision of $\\sim 1\\%$ and $\\sim 2\\%$\nrespectively. A $3$-$\\sigma$ level of discrepancy exists between the two\nmeasurements, for reasons that have yet to be understood. Gravitational wave\n(GW) sources accompanied by electromagnetic (EM) counterparts offer a\ncompletely independent standard siren (the GW analogue of an astronomical\nstandard candle) measurement of $H_0$, as demonstrated following the discovery\nof the neutron star merger, GW170817. This measurement does not assume a\ncosmological model and is independent of a cosmic distance ladder. The first\njoint analysis of the GW signal from GW170817 and its EM localization led to a\nmeasurement of $H_0=74^{+16}_{-8}$ km/s/Mpc (median and symmetric $68\\%$\ncredible interval).

A\nparameter which is common to and plays a key role in both the GW and the EM\nanalyses is the viewing angle of the binary's orbit. If a binary is viewed from\ndifferent angles, the amount of GW energy changes (implying that orientation\nand distance are correlated) and the EM signatures can vary, depending on the\nstructure of the emission. Information about the viewing angle of the binary\norbital plane is therefore crucial to the interpretation of both the GW and the\nEM data, and can potentially be extracted from either side.\n  In the first part of this study, we present a systematic analysis of how well\nthe viewing angle of binary neutron stars can be measured from the GW data.

By assuming inflation and big bang\nnucleosynthesis we can solve for the present fractional densities of matter\nOmega_{m,0} and vacuum Omega_{Lambda, 0} in terms of only one parameter which\nwe call the vacuum domination crossing redshift, z_c. We put constraints on z_c\nto obtain a universe that is presently vacuum dominated and with characteristic\ndensities consistent with observations. The model points to the possible\nexistence of newly formed dark matter in the inter-cluster voids. We argue that\nsome of this matter could be accreting onto clusters through the latter's long\nrange gravitational potentials. If so, then cluster dark matter halos may not\nmanifest clear cut-offs in their radial density profiles. Furthermore, if a\nsubstantial amount of this newly produced matter has already drained onto the\nclusters, then the CMB power spectrum may favor lower dark matter density\nvalues than is currently observed bound in the clusters.

It is then expected that\ninteractions of these cosmic rays with photons of the cosmic background\nradiation (CBR) should produce a drastic reduction in their flux above and\nenergy of about $5 \\times 10^{19}$ eV (50 EeV), the so-called ``GZK effect''.\nAt present, the existence of this effect is uncertain owing to conflicting\nobservational data and small number statistics. We show here that a small\namount of Lorentz invariance violation (LIV), which could turn off photomeson\ninteractions of UHECRs with the CBR, could explain the UHECR spectrum as\nmeasured by {\\it AGASA} which shows an excess of UHECRs at energies above 100\nEeV. If new results from the {\\it Auger} array agree with the {\\it AGASA}\nspectrum, this may be interpreted as evidence for a small amount of LIV.

Despite their appeal, these so\ncalled emergent models suffer from a number of limitations. These include the\nfact that they rely on an initial Einstein static state to describe the past\neternal phase of the universe. Given the instability of such a state within the\ncontext of general relativity, this amounts to a very severe fine tuning. Also\nin order to be able to study the dynamics of the universe within the context of\ngeneral relativity, they set the initial conditions for the universe in the\nclassical phase. Here we study the existence and stability of such models in\nthe context of Loop Quantum Cosmology and show that both these limitations can\nbe partially remedied, once semi-classical effects are taken into account. An\nimportant consequence of these effects is to give rise to a static solution\n(not present in GR), which dynamically is a centre equilibrium point and\nlocated in the more natural semi-classical regime. This allows the construction\nof emergent models in which the universe oscillates indefinitely about such an\ninitial static state.

Hybrid equations of state (EOSs) are\nadopted mimicking realistic, stiff nuclear EOSs, for which the maximum allowed\ngravitational mass of cold and spherical neutron stars (NSs), M_sph, is larger\nthan 2M_sun. For the simulations, we focus on BNSs of the ADM mass M>2.6M_sun.\nFor M>M_thr, the merger results in prompt formation of a BH irrespective of the\nmass ratio Q_M with 0.65<Q_M<1. The value of M_thr is approximately written as\n1.3-1.35M_sph for the chosen EOSs. For the BH formation case, we evolve the\nspacetime using a BH excision technique and determine the mass of a\nquasistationary disk surrounding the BH. The disk mass steeply increases with\ndecreasing the value of Q_M for given ADM mass and EOS. For M<M_thr, the\noutcome is a hypermassive neutron star (HMNS) of a large ellipticity.

As this is the fundamental ingredient to sustain\ntraversable wormholes, this cosmic fluid presents us with a natural scenario\nfor the existence of these exotic geometries. Due to the fact of the\naccelerating Universe, macroscopic wormholes could naturally be grown from the\nsubmicroscopic constructions that originally pervaded the quantum foam. One\ncould also imagine an advanced civilization mining the cosmic fluid for phantom\nenergy necessary to construct and sustain a traversable wormhole.\n  In this context, we investigate the physical properties and characteristics\nof traversable wormholes constructed using the equation of state $p=\\omega\n\\rho$, with $\\omega<-1$.

This\npost-Newtonian gravitomagnetic driving of these modes dominates over the\nNewtonian tidal driving previously computed by Ho and Lai. To leading order in\nthe tidal expansion parameter R/r (where R is the radius of the neutron star\nand r is the orbital separation), only the l=2, |m|= 1 and |m| = 2 r-modes are\nexcited. The tidal work done on the star through this driving has an effect on\nthe evolution of the inspiral and on the phasing of the emitted gravitational\nwave signal. For a neutron star of mass M, radius R, spin frequency f_spin,\nmodeled as a Gamma =2 polytrope, with a companion also of mass M, the\ngravitational wave phase shift for the m=2 mode is\n(0.1radians)(R/10km)^4(M/1.4M_sun)^{-10/3}(f_spin/100Hz)^{2/3} for optimal spin\norientation. For canonical neutron star parameters this phase shift will likely\nnot be detectable by gravitational wave detectors such as LIGO, but if the\nneutron star radius is larger it may be detectable if the signal-to-noise ratio\nis moderately large. For neutron star - black hole binaries, the effect is\nsmaller; the phase shift scales as companion mass to the -4/3 power for large\ncompanion masses. The net energy transfer from the orbit into the star is\nnegative corresponding to a slowing down of the inspiral.

We also show that from the B${\\ddot a}$cklund\ntransformations relating different soliton solutions, it is possible to\nconstruct a flat SL(2,R) connection which forms the basis for the gauge theory\nformulation of JT dilaton gravity. \n\n"}
