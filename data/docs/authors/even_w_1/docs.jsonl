Some theoretical\nestimates for the cores of relaxed clusters predict an excess of helium\nabundance by up to a factor of a few over its primordial value. The\nintracluster helium abundance cannot be measured directly. This presents a\nsignificant source of uncertainty for cosmological tests based on the X-ray\nderived cluster quantities, such as the gas mass, total mass, and gas mass\nfraction, all of which depend on the assumed helium abundance. We point out\nthat cluster distances derived by combining the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) and\nX-ray data also depend on the helium abundance. This dependence can be used to\nmeasure the abundance, provided the distance is known independently. For\nexample, if one adopts the WMAP H_0 value, then the recent H_0 measurement by\nBonamente and collaborators, derived from SZ data on 38 clusters assuming a\nprimordial helium abundance, corresponds to an abundance excess by a factor of\n1.9+-0.8 within r~1 Mpc (using only their statistical errors). This shows that\ninteresting accuracy is within reach.

We calculate the evolution of several\nvery massive stars with initial masses M <~ 100 Msun from the main-sequence to\nthe beginning of the Fe-core collapse and simulate their explosions and\nnucleosynthesis. In order to avoid complications associated with strong\nmass-loss, we only consider metal-poor stars with initial metallicity Z =\nZsun/200.

This model differs\nfrom traditional models of supernova debris interacting with external CSM in\nthat here the shell is optically thick and the escape of radiation is delayed.\nWe show that any model attempting to account for SN2006gy's huge luminosity\nwith radiation emitted by ongoing CSM interaction fails for the following basic\nreason: the CSM density required to achieve the observed luminosity makes the\nsame circumstellar envelope opaque, forcing a thermal diffusion solution.

We argue that in principle it would\nbe better to fit the foregrounds non-parametrically - allowing the data to\ndetermine their shape - rather than selecting some functional form in advance\nand then fitting its parameters. Non-parametric fits often suffer from other\nproblems, however. We discuss these before suggesting a non-parametric method,\nWp smoothing, which seems to avoid some of them. After outlining the principles\nof Wp smoothing we describe an algorithm used to implement it. We then apply Wp\nsmoothing to a synthetic data cube for the LOFAR EoR experiment. The\nperformance of Wp smoothing, measured by the extent to which it is able to\nrecover the variance of the cosmological signal and to which it avoids leakage\nof power from the foregrounds, is compared to that of a parametric fit, and to\nanother non-parametric method (smoothing splines). We find that Wp smoothing is\nsuperior to smoothing splines for our application, and is competitive with\nparametric methods even though in the latter case we may choose the functional\nform of the fit with advance knowledge of the simulated foregrounds. Finally,\nwe discuss how the quality of the fit is affected by the frequency resolution\nand range, by the characteristics of the cosmological signal and by edge\neffects. \n\n"}

The low reflection fraction cannot be driven by disc\ntruncation which is at odds not only with the small inner disc radius we infer\nbut, most importantly, with the radiatively efficient nature of the source\n(L_Bol / L_Edd ~1). A plausible explanation is that the X-ray corona is the\nbase of a failed jet (RBS 1124 being radio-quiet) and actually outflowing at\nmildly relativistic speeds. Aberration reduces the irradiation of the disc,\nthus forcing a lower than standard reflection fraction, and halves the inferred\nsource intrinsic luminosity, reducing the derived Eddington ratio from ~1to\n~0.5.

Pushed by evidence of\nslow rotation prior to core-collapse, we focus on asphericities in neutrino\nemission and matter motions outside the protoneutron star. Based on the\ntwo-dimensional (2D) models, which mimic SASI-aided neutrino heating\nexplosions, we compute the neutrino anisotropies via the ray-tracing method in\na post-processing manner and calculate the resulting waveforms. With these\ncomputations, it is found that the waveforms exhibit more variety in contrast\nto the ones previously estimated by the ray-by-ray analysis (e.g., Kotake et\nal. (2007)). In addition to a positively growing feature, which was predicted\nto determine the total wave amplitudes predominantly, the waveforms are shown\nto exhibit large negative growth for some epochs during the growth of SASI.\nThese features are found to stem from the excess of neutrino emission in\nlateral directions, which can be precisely captured by the ray-tracing\ncalculation. Due to the negative contributions and the neutrino absorptions\nappropriately taken into account by the ray-tracing method, the wave amplitudes\nbecome more than one-order-of magnitude smaller than the previous estimation,\nthus making their detections very hard for a galactic source.On the other hand,\nit is pointed out that the GW spectrum from matter motions have its peak near\n$\\sim 100$ Hz, which could be characteristic for the SASI-induced supernova\nexplosions.(abridged) \n\n"}

The model precisely describes the evolution\nof the particle energy spectrum inside the source and takes into account a\nlight-crossing time effect for the produced radiation.

The\nspectrum of the 8 o'clock arc is rich in stellar and interstellar medium (ISM)\nfeatures, and presents several similarities to the well-known MS1512-cB58 LBG.\nThe stellar photospheric absorption lines allowed us to constrain the systemic\nredshift, z_sys = 2.7350+/-0.0003, of the galaxy, and derive its stellar\nmetallicity, Z=0.82 Z_sol. With a total stellar mass of ~4.2x10^{11} M_sol, the\n8 o'clock arc agrees with the mass-metallicity relation found for z>2\nstar-forming galaxies.

Abstract: It is generally assumed that the central galaxy in a dark matter halo, that\nis, the galaxy with the lowest specific potential energy, is also the brightest\nhalo galaxy (BHG), and that it resides at rest at the centre of the dark matter\npotential well. This central galaxy paradigm (CGP) is an essential assumption\nmade in various fields of astronomical research. In this paper we test the\nvalidity of the CGP using a large galaxy group catalogue constructed from the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey. For each group we compute two statistics, ${\\cal R}$\nand ${\\cal S}$, which quantify the offsets of the line-of-sight velocities and\nprojected positions of brightest group galaxies relative to the other group\nmembers. By comparing the cumulative distributions of $|{\\cal R}|$ and $|{\\cal\nS}|$ to those obtained from detailed mock group catalogues, we rule out the\nnull-hypothesis that the CGP is correct. Rather, the data indicate that in a\nnon-zero fraction $f_{\\rm BNC}(M)$ of all haloes of mass $M$ the BHG is not the\ncentral galaxy, but instead, a satellite galaxy. In particular, we find that\n$f_{\\rm BNC}$ increases from $\\sim 0.25$ in low mass haloes ($10^{12} h^{-1}\n{\\rm M_{\\odot}} \\leq M \\lsim 2 \\times 10^{13} h^{-1}{\\rm M_{\\odot}}$) to $\\sim\n0.4$ in massive haloes ($M \\gsim 5 \\times 10^{13} h^{-1} {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$).

All commonly employed dust\nattenuation curves (such as the Calzetti curve for starbursts, or a power-law\ncurve) provide poor fits to the ultraviolet colors for moderately and highly\ninclined galaxies.

We\nfollow three temporal evolutions of the internal rotation differing by their\ninitial conditions: very slow, moderate and fast rotation, with magnetic\nbraking at the arrival on the main sequence for the last two. We find that the\nmeridional velocity in the present solar radiative zone is extremely small in\ncomparison with those of the convective zone, smaller than 10^-6 cm/s instead\nof m/s. All models lead to a radial differential rotation profile but with a\nsignificantly different contrast.

The transport by\nrotation slightly influence the sound speed profile but its potential impact on\nthe chemicals in the transition region between radiation and convective zones.\nThis work pushes us to pursue the inclusion of the other dynamical processes to\nbetter reproduce the present observable and to describe the young active Sun.\nWe also need to get a better knowledge of solar gravity mode splittings to use\ntheir constraints. \n\n"}

Previous attempts to\nmeasure fesc have found a wide range of values, varying from less than 0.01 to\nnearly 1. Rather than finding a single value of fesc, we clarify through\nmodeling how internal properties of galaxies affect fesc through the density\nand distribution of neutral hydrogen within the galaxy, along with the rate of\nionizing photons production. We find that the escape fraction depends\nsensitively on the covering factor of clumps, along with the density of the\nclumped and interclump medium. One must therefore be cautious when dealing with\nan inhomogeneous medium. Fewer, high-density clumps lead to a greater escape\nfraction than more numerous low-density clumps. When more ionizing photons are\nproduced in a starburst, fesc increases, as photons escape more readily from\nthe gas layers. Large variations in the predicted escape fraction, caused by\ndifferences in the hydrogen distribution, may explain the large observed\ndifferences in fesc among galaxies. Values of fesc must also be consistent with\nthe reionization history. High-mass galaxies alone are unable to reionize the\nuniverse, because fesc > 1 would be required. Small galaxies are needed to\nachieve reionization, with greater mean escape fraction in the past. \n\n"}

Sufficient quantities of molecular gas are available in most BCGs to\npower their AGN by accretion alone. However, we find no correlation between AGN\npower and molecular gas mass over the range of jet power considered here. For a\ngiven AGN power, the BCG's gas mass and accretion efficiency, defined as the\nfraction of the available cold molecular gas that is required to power the AGN,\nboth vary by more than two orders of magnitude. Most of the molecular gas in\nBCGs is apparently consumed by star formation or is driven out of the nucleus\nby the AGN before it reaches the nuclear black hole.

As an example, we find a significant\nsignal-to-noise ratio in dark matter models with a decay rate fitting the\npositron excess as measured by PAMELA. This is the first time that dark matter\nfilaments are shown to be promising targets for indirect detection of dark\nmatter. On the other hand, the prospects for detectability of annihilating dark\nmatter in local extragalactic structures are less optimistic even with extreme\ncross-sections.

The fate of a given binary system is\ndetermined by the initial masses of the primary and companion, the initial\norbit (taken to be circular), the Reimers mass-loss parameter, and the tidal\nprescription employed. For a range of these parameters, we determine whether\nthe orbit expands due to mass loss or decays due to tidal torques. Where a\ncommon envelope (CE) phase ensues, we estimate the final orbital separation\nbased on the energy required to unbind the envelope. These calculations predict\nperiod gaps for planetary and brown dwarf companions to white dwarfs. In\nparticular, the lower end of the gap is the longest period at which companions\nsurvive their CE phase while the upper end of the gap is the shortest period at\nwhich a CE phase is avoided.

In\nthis work we compute the power spectrum in general multi-field models and show\nthat certain inflaton trajectories may lead to observationally significant\nimprints of `heavy' physics in the primordial power spectrum if the inflaton\ntrajectory turns, that is, traverses a bend, sufficiently fast (without\ninterrupting slow roll), even in cases where the normal modes have masses\napproaching the cutoff of our theory.

The sample is composed of normal ETGs having effective\nradii comparable to the mean radius of local ones and of compact ETGs having\neffective radii from two to six times smaller. We do not find evidence of a\ndependence of the compactness of ETGs on their stellar mass.

Earlier stars formed at z_form>5 are assembled in compact and more\nmassive (M_*>10^11 M_sun) ETGs while stars later formed (z_form<3) or resulting\nfrom subsequent episodes of star formation are assembled both in compact and\nnormal ETGs. Thus, the older the stellar population the higher the mass of the\nhosting galaxy but not vice versa.

The quantitative impact of the proposed elastic collisions on\nstructure formation has been estimated previously by Monte Carlo N-body\nsimulations and by a conducting fluid model, with apparently diverging results.\nTo improve this situation, we make direct comparisons between new Monte Carlo\nN-body simulations and solutions of the conducting fluid model, for isolated\nSIDM haloes of fixed mass. This allows us to separate cleanly the effects of\ngravothermal relaxation from those of continuous mass accretion in an expanding\nbackground universe. When these two methods were previously applied to halo\nformation with cosmological boundary conditions, they disagreed by an order of\nmagnitude about the size of the scattering cross section required to solve the\nso-called 'cusp-core problem.'

Generic Barriers\n  and non-Gaussian Initial Conditions Abstract: The excursion set theory, where density perturbations evolve stochastically\nwith the smoothing scale, provides a method for computing the dark matter halo\nmass function. The computation of the mass function is mapped into the\nso-called first-passage time problem in the presence of a moving barrier. The\nexcursion set theory is also a powerful formalism to study other properties of\ndark matter halos such as halo bias, accretion rate, formation time, merging\nrate and the formation history of halos. This is achieved by computing\nconditional probabilities with non-trivial initial conditions, and the\nconditional two-barrier first-crossing rate. In this paper we use the path\nintegral formulation of the excursion set theory to calculate analytically\nthese conditional probabilities in the presence of a generic moving barrier,\nincluding the one describing the ellipsoidal collapse, and for both Gaussian\nand non-Gaussian initial conditions. While most of our analysis associated with\nGaussian initial conditions assumes Markovianity (top-hat in momentum space\nsmoothing, rather than generic filters), the non-Markovianity of the random\nwalks induced by non-Gaussianity is consistently accounted for. We compute, for\na generic barrier, the first two scale-independent halo bias parameters, the\nconditional mass function and the halo formation time probability, including\nthe effects of non-Gaussianities. We also provide the expression for the\ntwo-constant-barrier first-crossing rate when non-Markovian effects are induced\nby a top-hat filter function in real space. \n\n"}

When $M_{crit}$ is higher than the maximum mass achieved by the WD,\nthe WD must spin down before it can explode. This introduces a delay between\nthe time at which the WD has completed its epoch of mass gain and the time of\nthe explosion. Matter ejected from the binary during mass transfer therefore\nhas a chance to become diffuse, and the explosion occurs in a medium with a\ndensity similar to that of typical regions of the interstellar medium. Also,\neither by the end of the WD's mass increase or else by the time of explosion,\nthe donor may exhaust its stellar envelope and become a WD. This alters,\ngenerally diminishing, explosion signatures related to the donor star.\nNevertheless, the spin-up/spin-down model is highly predictive.

In\nrecent years there has been considerable controversy on this issue. In\nparticular, for a quadratic potential, Kofman, Linde and Mukhanov have argued\nthat the probability of inflation with at least 65 e-foldings is close to one,\nwhile Gibbons and Turok have argued that this probability is suppressed by a\nfactor of ~ $\\10^{-85}$. We first clarify that such dramatically different\npredictions can arise because the required measure on the space of solutions is\nintrinsically ambiguous in general relativity.

During the evolution, the disky dwarfs undergo strong mass loss,\nthe stellar disks are transformed into spheroids, and rotation is replaced by\nrandom motions of the stars.

This complexity is triggering the interest of the whole GRB\ncommunity.

Among all clusters/groups of a flux-limited X-ray sample, we predict\nVirgo, Fornax and M49 to be the brightest DM sources and find a particularly\nlow CR-induced background for Fornax. For a minimum substructure mass given by\nthe DM free-streaming scale, cluster halos maximize the substructure boost for\nwhich we find a factor above 1000. Since regions around the virial radius\ndominate the annihilation flux of substructures, the resulting surface\nbrightness profiles are almost flat. This makes it very challenging to detect\nthis flux with imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes. Assuming cold dark\nmatter with a substructure mass distribution down to an Earth mass and using\nextended Fermi upper limits, we rule out the leptophilic models in their\npresent form in 28 clusters, and limit the boost from SFE in M49 and Fornax to\nbe < 5.

At variance with the composite\ngalaxy stellar mass functions (GSMFs) of similarly massive systems, both fossil\ngroup GSMFs are dominated by passively evolving galaxies down to M^stars~1E10\nM_sun (according to the galaxy broad-band spectral energy distributions). The\nrelative lack of star-forming galaxies with 1E10<=M^stars<=1E11 M_sun is\nconfirmed by the galaxy distribution in the b-r vs i color-magnitude diagram.\nHence, the 2 fossil groups appear as more mature than the coeval, similarly\nmassive groups. Their overall star formation activity ended rapidly after an\naccelerated build up of the total stellar mass; no significant infall of\ngalaxies with M^stars>=1E10 M_sun took place in the last 3 to 6 Gyr.

To this\nend we use exact solutions of Einstein's equations (Meures & Bruni 2011) where,\nstarting from small fluctuations, inhomogeneities arise from a standard growing\nmode and become non-linear. While the matter distribution in these models is\nnecessarily idealised, there is still enough freedom to assume an arbitrary\ninitial density profile along the line of sight. We can therefore model\nover-densities and voids of various sizes and distributions, e.g. single\nharmonic sinusoidal modes, coupled modes, and more general distributions in a\n\\Lambda CDM background. Our models allow for an exact treatment of the light\npropagation problem, so that the results are unaffected by approximations and\nunambiguous. Along lines of sight with density inhomogeneities which average\nout on scales less than the Hubble radius, we find the distance redshift\nrelation to diverge negligibly from the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker\n(FLRW) result. On the contrary, if we observe along lines of sight which do not\nhave the same average density as the background, we find large deviations from\nthe FLRW distance redshift relation. Hence, a possibly large systematic might\nbe introduced into the analysis of cosmological observations, e.g. supernovae,\nif we observe along lines of sight which are typically more or less dense than\nthe average density of the Universe. In turn, this could lead to wrong\nparameter estimation: even if the Cosmological Principle is valid, the\nidentification of the true FLRW background in an inhomogeneous universe maybe\nmore difficult than usually assumed. \n\n"}

We\nfirst consider a collision between two test particles following the radial\ngeodesics in the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"{o}m naked singular geometry. An initially\nradially ingoing particle turns back due to the repulsive effect of gravity in\nthe vicinity of naked singularity.

Suzaku found the source in a minimum flux level;\na comparison with the XMM-Newton data implies an increase of a factor of 2.5 in\nthe 0.5-10 keV flux, in the 6 months separating the two observations. The iron\nK complex is detected in both datasets, with rather low equivalent width(s).\nThe intensity of the iron K complex does not respond to the change in continuum\nflux.

Indeed, during the XMM-Newton\nobservation, which was 6 months after, the absorber was not detected. No clear\nroll-over in the hard X-ray emission is detected, probably due to the emergence\nof the jet as a dominant component in the hard X-ray band, as suggested by the\ndetection above ~ 100 keV with the GSO on-board Suzaku, although the present\ndata do not allow us to firmly constrain the relative contribution of the\ndifferent components.

Noguchi (1998,1999) suggested another\nbulge formation scenario, `clump-origin bulge'. He demonstrated using a\nnumerical simulation that a galactic disc suffers dynamical instability to form\nclumpy structures in the early stage of disc formation since the premature disc\nis expected to be highly gas-rich, then the clumps are sucked into the galactic\ncentre by dynamical friction and merge into a single bulge at the centre. This\nbulge formation scenario, which is expected to happen only at the\nhigh-redshift, is different from the galactic merger and the secular evolution.\nTherefore, clump-origin bulges may have their own unique properties.

When the shock breakout\ntakes place in the dense wind with the density structure \\rho\\propto r^{-w},\nthe ratio of the diffusion timescale in the optically thick region of the wind\n(td) and the shock propagation timescale of the entire wind after the shock\nbreakout (ts) strongly depends on w.

For the\ncase td/ts\\simeq 1, the shock goes through the entire wind just after the light\ncurve (LC) peak and narrow spectral lines from the wind cannot be observed\nafter the LC peak (Type IIL LSNe). If td/ts is much smaller, the shock wave\ncontinues to propagate in the wind after the LC peak and unshocked wind remains\n(Type IIn LSNe).

Contrary to what was thought when the black hole mass\n- stellar velocity dispersion (\"M - sigma\") relationship was first discovered,\nit does not have a lower dispersion than the black hole mass - bulge luminosity\n(\"M - L\") relationship. The dispersion in the M - L relationship for AGNs\ndecreases strongly with increasing black hole mass or bulge luminosity. This is\nnaturally explained as a consequence of the black hole - bulge relationships\nbeing the result of averaging due to mergers. Simulations show that the\ndecrease in dispersion in the M - L relationship with increasing mass is in\nqualitative agreement with being driven by mergers. The large scatter in AGN\nblack hole masses at lower masses rules out significant AGN feedback.

We\nperform the first fully self-consistent Braginskii-MHD simulations of galaxy\nclusters including both of these effects. Specifically, we perform local and\nglobal simulations of the magnetothermal instability (MTI) and the\nheat-flux-driven buoyancy instability (HBI) and assess the effects of viscosity\non their saturation and astrophysical implications. We find that viscosity has\nonly a modest effect on the saturation of the MTI. As in previous calculations,\nwe find that the MTI can generate nearly sonic turbulent velocities in the\nouter parts of galaxy clusters, although viscosity somewhat suppresses the\nmagnetic field amplification. At smaller radii in cool-core clusters, viscosity\ncan decrease the linear growth rates of the HBI. However, it has less of an\neffect on the HBI's nonlinear saturation, in part because three-dimensional\ninterchange motions (magnetic flux tubes slipping past each other) are not\ndamped by anisotropic viscosity. In global simulations of cool core clusters,\nwe show that the HBI robustly inhibits radial thermal conduction and thus\nprecipitates a cooling catastrophe. The effects of viscosity are, however, more\nimportant for higher entropy clusters. We argue that viscosity can contribute\nto the global transition of cluster cores from cool-core to non cool-core\nstates: additional sources of intracluster turbulence, such as can be produced\nby AGN feedback or galactic wakes, suppress the HBI, heating the cluster core\nby thermal conduction; this makes the ICM more viscous, which slows the growth\nof the HBI, allowing further conductive heating of the cluster core and a\ntransition to a non cool-core state. \n\n"}

The criterion to enter the pair\ninstability regime in density and temperature is basically controlled by the\nmass of the oxygen core. The main sequence masses that produce a given oxygen\ncore mass are, in turn, dependent on metallicity, mass loss, and convective and\nrotationally-induced mixing. We examine the evolution of massive stars to\ndetermine the minimum main sequence mass that can encounter pair-instability\neffects, either a pulsational pair instability (PPISN) or a full-fledged\npair-instability supernova (PISN). We concentrate on zero-metallicity stars\nwith no mass loss subject to the Schwarzschild criterion for convective\ninstability, but also explore solar metallicity and mass loss and the Ledoux\ncriterion. As expected, for sufficiently strong rotationally-induced mixing,\nthe minimum main sequence mass is encountered for conditions that induce\neffectively homogeneous evolution such that the original mass is converted\nalmost entirely to helium and then to oxygen.

However a major uncertainty is the estimate of the orbital\ninclination angle of an X-ray binary. Here we suggest to measure the black hole\nmass in an X-ray binary by measuring directly the black hole's orbital motion,\nthus obtaining the companion to black hole mass ratio. In this method we assume\nthat accretion disk wind moves with the black hole and thus the black hole's\norbital motion can be obtained from the Doppler velocity of the absorption\nlines produced in the accretion disk wind. We validate this method by analyzing\nthe Chandra/HETG observations of GRO J1655-40, in which the black hole orbital\nmotion with line of sight velocity of 90.8 (+-11.3) km/s, inferred from the\nDoppler velocity of disk-wind absorption lines, is consistent with the\nprediction from its previously measured system parameters.

Recent observations carried out by PACS, the\n60-210um Herschel photometric camera, in GOODS-S, GOODS-N and COSMOS allow us\nto unbiasedly estimate the far-IR luminosity, and hence the SF properties, of\nthe two samples. Accurate AGN host stellar masses are measured by decomposing\ntheir total emission into the stellar and nuclear components.

The level of SF\nenhancement is modest (~0.26dex at ~3sigma) at low X-ray luminosities\n(Lx<~10^43.5erg/s) and more pronounced (0.56dex at >10sigma) for bright AGNs.\nHowever, when comparing to star forming galaxies only, AGN hosts are broadly\nconsistent with the locus of their `main sequence'. We investigate the relative\nfar-IR luminosity distributions of active and inactive galaxies, and find a\nhigher fraction of PACS detected, hence normal and highly star forming systems\namong AGN hosts. Although different interpretations are possible, we explain\nour findings as a consequence of a twofold AGN growth path: faint AGNs evolve\nthrough secular processes, with instantaneous AGN accretion not tightly linked\nto the current total SF in the host, while luminous AGNs co-evolve with their\nhosts through periods of enhanced AGN activity and SF, possibly through major\nmergers. While an increased SF with respect to non-AGNs of similar mass is\nexpected in the latter, we interpret the modest SF offsets measured in low-Lx\nAGN hosts as either a) generated by non-synchronous accretion and SF histories\nin a merger scenario or b) due to possible connections between instantaneous SF\nand accretion that can be induced by smaller scale (non-major merger)\nmechanisms.

If the origin of these SLSNe is a core-collapse-driven explosion of a\nmassive star, then the mechanism which converts the explosion energy into\nradiation must be very efficient (much more than in typical core collapse SNe,\nwhere this efficiency is of order one percent). We examine the scenario where\nthe radiated luminosity is due to efficient conversion of kinetic energy of the\nejected stellar envelope into radiation by interaction with an optically thick,\npre-existing circumstellar material (CSM), presumably the product of a steady\nwind from the progenitor.

Recent studies have suggested that a significant fraction of the\nfirst stars may have had low masses (a few M_sun). Such stars do not leave BH\nremnants and they have softer spectra, with copious infrared (IR) radiation at\nphoton energies around 1eV. Similar to LW and X-ray photons, these photons have\na mean-free path comparable to the Hubble distance, building up an early IR\nbackground.

We first demonstrate the capabilities of the method by\napplying it to realistic simulated SNIa data, based on the real 3-year data\nrelease from the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS3). Assuming typical values for\nthe halo parameters in our simulations, we find that a catalogue analogous to\nthe existing SNLS3 data set is incapable of detecting the lensing signal, but a\ncatalogue containing approximately three times as many SNIa does produce robust\nand accurate parameter constraints and model selection results for two halo\nmodels: a truncated singular isothermal sphere (SIS) and a\nNavarro--Frenk--White (NFW) profile, thereby validating our analysis\nmethodology. In the analysis of the real SNLS3 data, contrary to previous\nstudies, we obtain only a very marginal detection of a lensing signal and weak\nconstraints on the halo parameters for the truncated SIS model, although these\nconstraints are tighter than those obtained from the equivalent simulated SNIa\ndata set. This difference is driven by a preferred value of $\\eta \\approx 1$ in\nthe assumed scaling-law $\\sigma \\propto L^\\eta$ between velocity dispersion and\nluminosity, which is somewhat higher than the canonical values of $\\eta =\n\\tfrac{1}{4}$ and $\\eta = \\tfrac{1}{3}$ for early and late-type galaxies,\nrespectively, and leads to a stronger lensing effect by the halo.

Our analyses show that the R-M effect for\na binary planet or exomoon during its complete transit phase can be divided\ninto two parts. The first is the conventional one similar to the R-M effect\nfrom the transit of a single planet, of which the mass and the projected area\nare the combinations of the binary components; and the second is caused by the\norbital rotation of the binary components, which may add a sine- or linear-mode\ndeviation to the stellar radial velocity curve. We find that the latter effect\ncan be up to several or several ten m/s. By doing numerical simulations as well\nas analytical analyses, we illustrate that the distribution and dispersion of\nthe latter effects obtained from multiple transit events can be used to\nconstrain the dynamical configuration of the binary planet, such as, how the\ninner orbit of the binary planet is inclined to its orbit rotating around the\ncentral star. We find that the signatures caused by the orbital rotation of the\nbinary components are more likely to be revealed if the two components of\nbinary planet have different masses and mass densities, especially if the heavy\none has a high mass density and the light one has a low density.

Abstract: A leading formation scenario for R Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars invokes the\nmerger of degenerate He and CO white dwarfs (WD) in a binary. The observed\nratio of 16O/18O for RCB stars is in the range of 0.3-20 much smaller than the\nsolar value of ~500. In this paper, we investigate whether such a low ratio can\nbe obtained in simulations of the merger of a CO and a He white dwarf. We\npresent the results of five 3-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of the\nmerger of a double white dwarf system where the total mass is 0.9 Mdot and the\ninitial mass ratio (q) varies between 0.5 and 0.99. We identify in simulations\nwith $q\\lesssim0.7$ a feature around the merged stars where the temperatures\nand densities are suitable for forming 18O. However, more 16O is being\ndredged-up from the C- and O-rich accretor during the merger than the amount of\n18O that is produced. Therefore, on a dynamical time scale over which our\nhydrodynamics simulation runs, a 16O/18O ratio of ~2000 in the \"best\" case is\nfound. If the conditions found in the hydrodynamic simulations persist for 10^6\nseconds the oxygen ratio drops to 16 in one case studied, while in a hundred\nyears it drops to ~4 in another case studied, consistent with the observed\nvalues in RCB stars. Therefore, the merger of two white dwarfs remains a strong\ncandidate for the formation of these enigmatic stars. \n\n"}

We show that all\nthese properties are naturally explained if the circumstellar material (CSM)\ndensity is low and therefore the forward shock is expanding into the CSM\nwithout deceleration.

One such case was SN 2009ip, which was recognized to\nbe a luminous blue variable (LBV) eruption. This source had a massive hot\nprogenitor star identified in pre-explosion data, it had documented evidence of\npre-outburst variability, and it was subsequently discovered to have a 2nd\noutburst in 2010. This same source rebrightened again in 2012, and early\nspectra showed the same narrow-line profiles as before, suggesting another\nLBV-like eruption. We present new photometry and spectroscopy of SN 2009ip,\nindicating that it has transitioned into a true SN. The most striking discovery\nin these data is that unlike previous reports, the spectrum exhibited Balmer\nlines with very broad P-Cygni profiles characteristic of normal Type II\nsupernovae (SNe II), in addition to narrow emission lines seen in SNe IIn and\nLBVs. Emission components have FWHM 8000 km/s, while the P-Cygni absorption\ncomponent has blue wings extending to -13,000 km/s. These velocities are\ntypical of SNe II, but have never been associated with emission lines from a\nnonterminal LBV-like eruption. Initially, the peak absolute magnitude seemed\nfainter than that of normal SNe. However, after a brief period of fading, the\nsource quickly brightened again to M_R=-17.5 mag over a couple days. The broad\nlines mostly disappeared, and the spectrum began to resemble the early\noptically thick phases of SNe IIn. Two weeks later the source leveled off near\n-18 mag, after which broad emission lines again developed in the spectrum as\nthe source faded. We conclude that the 2012 outburst of SN 2009ip was the\nresult of a true core-collapse SN IIn that occured when the progenitor star was\nin an LBV-like outburst phase, and where the SN was initially faint and then\nrapidly brightened due to interaction with circumstellar material (abridged). \n\n"}

This\nis because in such a model the luminosity ratio of the External-Compton and\nsynchrotron components is tightly related to the frequency ratio of these\ncomponents, and in this particular case an unrealistically high energy density\nof the external radiation would be implied. Therefore, we consider a\nwell-constrained two-zone blazar model to interpret the entire dataset. In this\nframework, the observed infrared emission is associated with the synchrotron\ncomponent produced in the hot-dust region at the supra-pc scale, while the\ngamma-ray emission is associated with the External-Compton component produced\nin the broad-line region at the sub-pc scale. In addition, the optical/UV\nemission is associated with the accretion disk thermal emission, with the\naccretion disk corona likely contributing to the X-ray emission. \n\n"}

We present a scheme that combines the initial strong\nlensing of a Kerr black hole with standard linearized microlensing by\nintervening stars. We find that X-ray microlensed light curves incorporating\nKerr strong gravity can differ significantly from standard curves. The\namplitude of the fluctuations in the light curves can increase or decrease by\n~0.65-0.75 mag by including Kerr strong gravity. Larger inclination angles give\nlarger amplitude fluctuations in the microlensing light curves. Consequently,\ncurrent X-ray microlensing observations might have under or overestimated the\nsizes of the X-ray emission regions. We estimate this bias using a simple\nmetric based on the amplitude of magnitude fluctuations. The half light radius\nof the X-ray emission region can be underestimated up to ~50% or overestimated\nup to ~20%. Underestimates are found in most situations we have investigated.\nThe only exception is for a disk with large spin, radially flat emission\nprofile, and observed nearly face on, where an overestimate is found.

The most efficient mechanism known today is the\nsmall-scale dynamo, which converts turbulent kinetic energy into magnetic\nenergy leading to an exponential growth of the magnetic field.

Several mysteries cloud the interpretation\nof this event: (1) extreme flaring and `plateau' shape of the X-ray/gamma-ray\nlight curve during the first 10 days after the gamma-ray trigger; (2)\nunexpected rebrightening of the forward shock radio emission months after\ntrigger; (3) no obvious evidence for jet precession, despite misalignment\ntypically expected between the angular momentum of the accretion disk and BH;\n(4) recent abrupt shut-off in jet X-ray emission after 1.5 years. Here we show\nthat all of these seemingly disparate mysteries are naturally resolved by one\nassumption: the presence of strong magnetic flux Phi threading the BH.\nInitially, Phi is weak relative to high fall-back mass accretion rate, Mdot,\nand the disk and jets precess about the BH axis = our line of sight. As Mdot\ndrops, Phi becomes dynamically important and leads to a magnetically-arrested\ndisk (MAD). MAD naturally aligns disk and jet axis along the BH spin axis, but\nonly after a violent rearrangement phase (jet wobbling). This explains the\nerratic light curve at early times and the lack of precession at later times.\nWe use our model for Swift J1644+57 to constrain BH and disrupted star\nproperties, finding that a solar-mass main sequence star disrupted by a\nrelatively low mass, M~10^5-10^6 Msun, BH is consistent with the data, while a\nWD disruption (though still possible) is disfavored. The magnetic flux required\nto power Swift J1644+57 is too large to be supplied by the star itself, but it\ncould be collected from a quiescent `fossil' accretion disk present in the\ngalactic nucleus prior to the TD. The presence (lack of) of such a fossil disk\ncould be a deciding factor in what TD events are accompanied by powerful\njets.[abridged] \n\n"}

This estimator is straightforward to apply to\nobservations, it robustly finds the likelihood maximum, and it conveniently\nselects angular scales at which fluctuations are well approximated as\nindependent between redshift bins and at which linear theory applies. We find\nthat the linear bias times number of objects in a redshift bin generally can be\nconstrained with cross-correlations to fractional error (10^2 n/N)^1/2, where N\nis the total number of spectra per dz and n is the number of redshift bins\nspanned by the bulk of the unknown population.

This scenario contains\nself-interacting dark matter, but it is not the dominant component. Even if\nPIDM contains only a fraction of the net dark matter density, comparable to the\nbaryonic fraction, the subdominant component's interactions can lead to\ninteresting and potentially observable consequences.

We begin by\nintroducing the concept of holographically conjugate variables (HCVs) in terms\nof which the surface term in the action has a specific relationship with the\nbulk term. In addition to g_{ab} and its conjugate momentum \\sqrt{-g} M^{cab},\nthis procedure allows us to (re)discover and motivate strongly the use of\nf^{ab}=\\sqrt{-g}g^{ab} and its conjugate momentum N^c_{ab}. The gravitational\naction can then be interpreted as a momentum space action for these variables.\nWe also show that many expressions in classical gravity simplify considerably\nin this approach. For example, the field equations can be written in a form\nanalogous to Hamilton's equations for a suitable Hamiltonian if we use these\nvariables.

In the absence of collision to enforce thermal\nequilibrium post-shock, electrons and ions need not have the same temperatures.\nWhile the acceleration of electrons for injection into shock acceleration\nprocesses to produce cosmic rays has received considerable attention, the\nrelated problem of the shock heating of quasi-thermal electrons has been\nrelatively neglected.

Especially from directions\nclose to the Galactic Plane, the expected gamma-ray spectrum is altered via two\neffects: directly, by the photons emitted in the bremsstrahlung process on the\ninterstellar gas by energetic electrons which are among the DM annihilation\nbyproducts; indirectly, by the modification of the same electron spectrum, due\nto the additional energy loss process in the diffusion-loss equation (e.g. the\nresulting inverse Compton emission is altered). We quantify the importance of\nthe bremsstrahlung emission in the GeV energy range, showing that it is the\ndominant component of the gamma-ray spectrum for some cases. We also find that,\nin regions in which bremsstrahlung dominates energy losses, the related\ngamma-ray emission is only moderately sensitive to possible large variations in\nthe gas density. Still, we stress that, for computing precise spectra in the\n(sub-)GeV range, it is important to obtain a reliable description of the inner\nGalaxy gas distribution as well as to compute self-consistently the gamma\nemission and the solution to the diffusion-loss equation.

Its pre-2012 observations make\nit the best documented SN progenitor in history, but have fueled debate about\nthe nature of its 2012 explosion --- whether it was a true SN or some type of\nviolent non-terminal event.

If jet power is coupled to\nblack hole spin, deviations from the jet-disk correlation for a sample of AGN\ncan be used to probe the dispersion of the spin parameter within this sample.\nTo exploit this idea, we matched double-lobed radio sources from the FIRST\nsurvey to spectroscopically confirmed quasars from SDSS. We obtain 763 FR-II\nquasars with a median redshift of z=1.2 A tight correlation between the optical\nluminosity of the accretion disk and the lobe radio luminosity is observed. We\nestimate that 5-20% of the bolometric disk luminosity is converted to jet\npower. Most of the scatter to the optical-radio correlation is due to\nenvironment; deviations from jet-disk coupling due to internal factors (e.g.,\nspin) contribute at most 0.2 dex.

Denser starbursts are too overpressured for hot wind formation, but\nsupernovae still stir up the ISM. I argue that supernovae power ubiquitous\nturbulence through each of the starburst ISM phases, including the hot wind,\nand that a fluctuation dynamo amplifies magnetic fields until they are in\nequipartition with the turbulence.

At all redshifts, Tdust increases with infrared luminosities\n(LIR), specific SFRs (SSFR; i.e., SFR/M*) and distances with respect to the\nmain sequence (MS) of the SFR-M* plane (i.e.,\nD_SSFR_MS=log[SSFR(galaxy)/SSFR_MS(M*,z)]). The Tdust-SSFR and Tdust-D_SSFR_MS\ncorrelations are statistically more significant than the Tdust-LIR one. While\nthe slopes of these three correlations are redshift-independent, their\nnormalizations evolve from z=0 and z~2. We convert these results into a recipe\nto derive Tdust from SFR, M* and z. The existence of a strong Tdust-D_SSFR_MS\ncorrelation provides us with information on the dust and gas content of\ngalaxies. (i) The slope of the Tdust-D__SSFR_MS correlation can be explained by\nthe increase of the star-formation efficiency (SFE; SFR/Mgas) with D_SSFR_MS as\nfound locally by molecular gas studies.

Sco X-1 Abstract: Rapidly-rotating neutron stars are the only candidates for persistent\nhigh-frequency gravitational wave emission, for which a targeted search can be\nperformed based on the spin period measured from electromagnetic (e.g. radio\nand X-ray) observations. The principal factor determining the sensitivity of\nsuch searches is the measurement precision of the physical parameters of the\nsystem. Neutron stars in X-ray binaries present additional computational\ndemands for searches due to the uncertainty in the binary parameters. We\npresent the results of a pilot study with the goal of improving the measurement\nprecision of binary orbital parameters for candidate gravitational wave\nsources. We observed the optical counterpart of Sco X-1 in 2011 June with the\nWilliam Herschel Telescope, and also made use of Very Large Telescope\nobservations in 2011, to provide an additional epoch of radial-velocity\nmeasurements to earlier measurements in 1999. From a circular orbit fit to the\ncombined dataset, we obtained an improvement of a factor of two in the orbital\nperiod precision, and a factor of 2.5 in the epoch of inferior conjunction\n$T_0$. While the new orbital period is consistent with the previous value of\nGottllieb et al.

The fate of the beam energy is uncertain. By\nmeans of two- and three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, we study the\nnon-linear evolution of dilute ultra-relativistic pair beams propagating\nthrough the IGM.

We provide supernova (SN) models\nand synthetic light curves for two progenitor models, a 150 Msun red-supergiant\nand a 250 Msun yellow-supergiant at a metallicity of Z=0.001, for which the\nevolution from the main sequence to collapse, and the initiation of the PISN\nitself, has been previously computed in a realistic and self-consistent way.

Its 56Ni mass of 0.04 Msun\nalso falls well into the range found in ordinary core collapse SNe.

We have\ninvestigated the structures and kinematics of the outflows driven by the YSO DG\nTauri, using the Near-infrared Integral Field Spectrograph (NIFS) on Gemini\nNorth. The blueshifted outflow shows two distinct components in [Fe II] 1.644\nmicron emission, which are separated using multi-component line fitting. A\nstationary recollimation shock is observed, in agreement with previous X-ray\nand FUV observations. The presence of this shock indicates that the innermost\nstreamlines of the high-velocity component are launched at a very small radius,\n0.01-0.15 AU, from the central star. The jet accelerates and expands downstream\nof the recollimation shock; the 'acceleration' is likely a sign of velocity\nvariations in the jet. No evidence of rotation is found, and we compare this\nnon-detection to previous counter-claims. Moving jet knots, likely the result\nof the jet velocity variations, are observed. One of these knots moves more\nslowly than previously observed knots, and the knot ejection interval appears\nto be non-periodic. An intermediate-velocity component surrounds this central\njet, and is interpreted as the result of a turbulent mixing layer along the jet\nboundaries. Such lateral entrainment requires the presence of a magnetic field\nof strength a few mG or less at hundreds of AU above the disc surface, which is\nargued to be a reasonable proposition.

We divide the full sample into subsamples of ~20\nclusters based on redshift and central density, performing an X-ray fit to all\nclusters in a subsample simultaneously, assuming self-similarity of the\ntemperature profile. This approach allows us to constrain the shape of the\ntemperature profile over 0<r<1.5R500, which would be impossible on a\nper-cluster basis, since the observations of individual clusters have, on\naverage, 2000 X-ray counts.

In the first part we study the production, nature and decay\nprocesses of cosmic superstrings in two widely used effective models of D-brane\ninflation, namely the $D3/D7$ and $D3/\\bar{D}3$ models.

Aims. We determine the\nSMF of the z=0.44 cluster of galaxies MACS J1206.2-0847 separately for passive\nand star-forming (SF) galaxies, in different regions of the cluster, from the\ncenter out to approximately 2 virial radii.

Stellar masses are obtained by SED fitting\non 5-band photometric data obtained at the Subaru telescope. We identify 1363\ncluster members down to a stellar mass of 10^9.5 Msolar. Results. The whole\ncluster SMF is well fitted by a double Schechter function. The SMFs of cluster\nSF and passive galaxies are statistically different. The SMF of the SF cluster\ngalaxies does not depend on the environment. The SMF of the passive population\nhas a significantly smaller slope (in absolute value) in the innermost (<0.50\nMpc), highest density cluster region, than in more external, lower density\nregions. The number ratio of giant/subgiant galaxies is maximum in this\ninnermost region and minimum in the adjacent region, but then gently increases\nagain toward the cluster outskirts. This is also reflected in a decreasing\nradial trend of the average stellar mass per cluster galaxy. On the other hand,\nthe stellar mass fraction, i.e., the ratio of stellar to total cluster mass,\ndoes not show any significant radial trend. Conclusions. Our results appear\nconsistent with a scenario in which SF galaxies evolve into passive galaxies\ndue to density-dependent environmental processes, and eventually get destroyed\nvery near the cluster center to become part of a diffuse intracluster medium. \n\n"}

A preference of\n  hydrogen-poor events for extreme emission line galaxies Abstract: Superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are very bright explosions that were only\ndiscovered recently and that show a preference for occurring in faint dwarf\ngalaxies. Understanding why stellar evolution yields different types of stellar\nexplosions in these environments is fundamental in order to both uncover the\nelusive progenitors of SLSNe and to study star formation in dwarf galaxies. In\nthis paper, we present the first results of our project to study SUperluminous\nSupernova Host galaxIES, focusing on the sample for which we have obtained\nspectroscopy. We show that SLSNe-I and SLSNe-R (hydrogen-poor) often (~50% in\nour sample) occur in a class of galaxies that is known as Extreme Emission Line\nGalaxies (EELGs). The probability of this happening by chance is negligible and\nwe therefore conclude that the extreme environmental conditions and the SLSN\nphenomenon are related.

Therefore, if\nSLSNe-II constitute a uniform class, their progenitor systems are likely\ndifferent from those of H-poor SLSNe.

We find that the total\nwave energy eventually grows to approximate equipartition with the beam by\nincreasingly depositing energy into long wavelength modes. As we have not\nincluded the effect of nonlinear wave-wave interactions on these long\nwavelength modes, this scenario represents the \"worst-case\" scenario for the\noblique instability. As it continues to drain energy from the beam at a faster\nrate than other processes, we conclude that the \"oblique\" instability is\nsufficiently strong to make it the physically dominant cooling mechanism for\nhigh-energy pair beams in the intergalactic medium. \n\n"}

Abstract: We present follow-up observations of an optical transient (OT) discovered by\nROTSE on Jan. 21, 2009. Photometric monitoring was carried out with ROTSE-IIIb\nin the optical and Swift in the UV up to +70 days after discovery. The light\ncurve showed a fast rise time of ~10 days followed by a steep decline over the\nnext 60 days, which was much faster than that implied by 56Ni - 56Co\nradioactive decay. The SDSS DR10 database contains a faint, red object at the\nposition of the OT, which appears slightly extended. This and other lines of\nevidence suggest that the OT is of extragalactic origin, and this faint object\nis likely the host galaxy. A sequence of optical spectra obtained with the\n9.2-m Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) between +8 and +45 days after discovery\nrevealed a hot, blue continuum with no visible spectral features. A few weak\nfeatures that appeared after +30 days probably originated from the underlying\nhost. Fitting synthetic templates to the observed spectrum of the host galaxy\nrevealed a redshift of z = 0.19. At this redshift the peak magnitude of the OT\nis close to -22.5, similar to the brightest super-luminous supernovae; however,\nthe lack of identifiable spectral features makes the massive stellar death\nhypothesis less likely. A more plausible explanation appears to be the tidal\ndisruption of a sun-like star by the central super-massive black hole. We argue\nthat this transient likely belongs to a class of super-Eddington tidal\ndisruption events. \n\n"}

For the former, we found that, in the presence of non-interacting\nand non-relativistic matter, the $F(R)$ gravity that reproduces the late time\nlimit of the matter bounce solution is actually the Einstein-Hilbert gravity\nplus a power law term. In the early time limit, since it corresponds to large\nspacetime curvatures, assuming that the Jordan frame is described by a general\nmetric that when it is conformally transformed to the Einstein frame, produces\nan accelerating Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric, we found explicitly the\nscalar field dependence on time.

An interesting result is that\neven though, as expected, voids in the dark matter field are emptier in $f(R)$\ngravity due to the fifth force expelling away from the void centres, this\nresult is reversed when haloes are used to find voids. The abundance of voids\nin this case becomes even lower in $f(R)$ compared to GR for large voids.\nStill, the differences are significant and this provides a way to tell apart\nthese models. The velocity field differences between $f(R)$ and GR, on the\nother hand, are the same for halo voids and for dark matter voids. Paz et al.\n(2013), concentrate on the velocity profiles around voids.

Mergers producing a longer-lived neutron\nstar, or a more rapidly spinning black hole, have stronger neutrino\nirradiation, generate more lanthanide-free ejecta, and are optically brighter\nand bluer.

We used deep, JHKs images from the newly commissioned\nGemini-GeMS/GSAOI instrument, complemented with Spitzer IRAC observations, in\norder to study the photometric properties of the young stellar cluster.

In\nparticular it is not clear whether the observations of parsec-scale jets using\nthe very long baseline interferometric technique (VLBI) reveal wave-like\nstructures that develop and propagate along the jet, or trace the jet flow\nitself. In this contribution I review the evidence collected during the last\nyears showing that the ridge-lines of helical radio-jets do not correspond to\nobservational artifacts. This conclusion was reached by studying a number of\nVLBI observations of the radio jet in the quasar S5~0836+710 at different\nfrequencies and epochs. The ridge-line of the emission in the jet coincides at\nall frequencies within the errors. Moreover, small differences between the\nridge-lines as observed at different epochs reveal wave-like motion transversal\nto the jet propagation axis. I also discuss similar results, albeit with\ndifferent interpretations, obtained by other authors. The current challenge is\nto measure the propagation velocities of these waves and to try to characterise\nthem in terms of simple perturbations or Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, which\nwould help understanding the physical conditions of the flow where the waves\ndevelop. This problem can only be tackled by high-resolution observations such\nas those that can be achieved by the space radio-antenna Radioastron. \n\n"}

Further, relying on\nsimulated realisations of the survey data means that tests of the cosmology\ndependence of the covariance are expensive. With these points in mind, this\nwork presents a simple theoretical model for the linear covariance of\nanisotropic galaxy clustering observations with synthetic catalogues.\nConsidering the Legendre moments (`multipoles') of the two-point statistics and\nprojections into wide bins of the line-of-sight parameter (`clustering\nwedges'), we describe the modelling of the covariance for these anisotropic\nclustering measurements for galaxy samples with a trivial geometry in the case\nof a Gaussian approximation of the clustering likelihood. As main result of\nthis paper, we give the explicit formulae for Fourier and configuration space\ncovariance matrices. To validate our model, we create synthetic HOD galaxy\ncatalogues by populating the haloes of an ensemble of large-volume N-body\nsimulations. Using linear and non-linear input power spectra, we find very good\nagreement between the model predictions and the measurements on the synthetic\ncatalogues in the quasi-linear regime. \n\n"}

SN 2013fc is both photometrically and\nspectroscopically similar to the well-studied type IIn SN 1998S and to the\nbright type II-L SN 1979C.

Abstract: An increasing number of so-called superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are\ndiscovered. It is believed that at least some of them with slowly fading light\ncurves originate in stellar explosions induced by the pair instability\nmechanism. Recent stellar evolution models naturally predict pair instability\nsupernovae (PISNe) from very massive stars at wide range of metallicities (up\nto Z=0.006, Yusof et al. 2013). In the scope of this study we analyse whether\nPISN models can match the observational properties of SLSNe with various light\ncurve shapes. Specifically, we explore the influence of different degrees of\nmacroscopic chemical mixing in PISN explosive products on the resulting\nobservational properties. We artificially apply mixing to the 250 Msun PISN\nevolutionary model from Kozyreva et al. (2014) and explore its supernova\nevolution with the one-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics code STELLA. The\ngreatest success in matching SLSN observations is achieved in the case of an\nextreme macroscopic mixing, where all radioactive material is ejected into the\nhydrogen-helium outer layer. Such an extreme macroscopic redistribution of\nchemicals produces events with faster light curves with high photospheric\ntemperatures and high photospheric velocities. These properties fit a wider\nrange of SLSNe than non-mixed PISN model. Our mixed models match the light\ncurves, colour temperature and photospheric velocity evolution of two\nwell-observed SLSNe PTF12dam and LSQ12dlf. However, these models' extreme\nchemical redistribution may be hard to realise in massive PISNe.

The\ndark-matter-only version of the Illustris simulation enables us to compute the\neffects of galaxy formation on such constraints on a halo-by-halo basis; on\nsmall scales, galaxy formation enhances the density relative to\ndark-matter-only runs, while the total mass density is approximately 20% lower\nat large Galactocentric distances.

The jets that are launched by the accreting NS or black\nhole (BH) maintain their axis due to a rapidly rotating pre-collapse core, and\ndo not manage to eject core material from near the equatorial plane. The jets\nare able to eject material from the core along the polar directions, and reduce\nthe gravity near the equatorial plane.

Such propagation provides a prominent, and puzzling constraint on\ndynamo models.

Because the mass\nof ejecta from these channels could be quite different, their light curves are\nalso expected to be diverse. We evaluate the dynamic evolution of optical\ntransients powered by millisecond magnetars. We find that the magnetar with\nshort spin-down timescale converts its rotational energy mostly into the\nkinetic energy of the transient, while the energy of a magnetar with long\nspin-down timescale goes into radiation of the transient. This leads us to\nspeculate that hypernovae could be powered by magnetars with short spin-down\ntimescales. At late times the optical transients will gradually evolve into a\nnebular phase because of the photospheric recession. We treat the photosphere\nand nebula separately because their radiation mechanisms are different.

Our results confirm\nthat the density profiles of the first haloes are described by a $\\sim\nr^{-1.5}$ power-law. As haloes grow in mass, their density profiles evolve\nsignificantly. In the central regions, they become shallower and reach on\naverage $\\sim r^{-1}$, the asymptotic form of an NFW profile. Using\nnon-cosmological controlled simulations, we observe that temporal variations in\nthe gravitational potential caused by major mergers lead to a shallowing of the\ninner profile. This transformation is more significant for shallower initial\nprofiles and for a higher number of merging systems. Depending on the merger\ndetails, the resulting profiles can be shallower or steeper than NFW in their\ninner regions. Interestingly, mergers have a much weaker effect when the\nprofile is given by a broken power-law with an inner slope of $-1$ (such as NFW\nor Hernquist profiles). This offers an explanation for the emergence of\nNFW-like profiles: after their initial collapse, $r^{-1.5}$ $\\chi$DM haloes\nsuffer copious major mergers, which progressively shallows the profile. Once an\nNFW-like profile is established, subsequent merging do not change the profile\nanymore. This suggests that halo profiles are not universal but rather a\ncombination of (1) the physics of the formation of the microhaloes and (2)\ntheir early merger history -- both set by the properties of the dark matter\nparticle -- as well as (3) the resilience of NFW-like profiles to\nperturbations. \n\n"}

In one of the leading formation\nscenarios, a black hole of $\\sim100$ M$_{\\odot}$ results from the collapse of\nthe inner core of a supermassive star ($\\gtrsim 10^{4-5}$ M$_{\\odot}$), created\nby the rapid accumulation ($\\gtrsim 0.1 $ M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) of pristine\ngas at the centre of newly formed galaxies at $z\\sim 15$. The subsequent\nevolution is still speculative: the remaining gas in the supermassive star can\neither directly plunge into the nascent black hole, or part of it can form a\ncentral accretion disc, whose luminosity sustains a surrounding, massive, and\nnearly hydrostatic envelope (a system called a \"quasi-star\"). To address this\npoint, we consider the effect of rotation on a quasi-star, as angular momentum\nis inevitably transported towards the galactic nucleus by the accumulating gas.\nUsing a model for the internal redistribution of angular momentum that\nqualitative matches results from simulations of rotating convective stellar\nenvelopes, we show that quasi-stars with an envelope mass greater than a few\n$10^{5}$ M$_{\\odot} \\times (\\rm black~hole~mass/100 M_{\\odot})^{0.82}$ have\nhighly sub-keplerian gas motion in their core, preventing gas circularisation\noutside the black hole's horizon. Less massive quasi-stars could form but last\nfor only $\\lesssim 10^4$ years before the accretion luminosity unbinds the\nenvelope, suppressing the black hole growth. We speculate that this might\neventually lead to a dual black hole seed population: (i) massive ($>10^{4}$\nM$_{\\odot}$) seeds formed in the most massive ($> 10^{8}$ M$_{\\odot}$) and rare\nhaloes; (ii) lighter ($\\sim 10^{2}$ M$_{\\odot}$) seeds to be found in less\nmassive and therefore more common haloes. \n\n"}

The correlations considered include the matter\ndensity-intrinsic ellipticity (mI), galaxy density-intrinsic ellipticity (dI),\ngravitational shear-intrinsic ellipticity (GI), and intrinsic\nellipticity-intrinsic ellipticity (II) correlations. We find stronger\ncorrelations for more massive and more luminous galaxies, as well as for\nearlier photometric types, in agreement with observations. Moreover, the\ncorrelations significantly depend on the choice of shape estimator, even if\ncalibrated to serve as unbiased shear estimators. In particular, shape\nestimators that down-weight the outer parts of galaxy images produce much\nweaker IA signals on intermediate and large scales than methods employing flat\nradial weights.

In particular, the LIGO detectors are most sensitive to\nsources above North America and the Indian Ocean and, as the Earth rotates, the\nsensitive regions are swept across the sky. However, because the detectors do\nnot acquire data uniformly over time, there is a net bias on detectable\nsources' right ascensions. Both LIGO detectors preferentially collect data\nduring their local night; it is more than twice as likely to be local midnight\nthan noon when both detectors are operating. We discuss these selection effects\nand how they impact LIGO's observations and electromagnetic follow-up. Beyond\ngalactic foregrounds associated with seasonal variations, we find that\nequatorial observatories can access over $80\\%$ of the localization\nprobability, while mid-latitudes will access closer to $70\\%$.

Abstract: Recently, high angular resolution imaging instruments such as SPHERE and GPI\nhave discovered many spiral-arm-like features in near-infrared scattered light\nimages of protoplanetary disks. Theory and simulations have suggested that\nthese arms are most likely excited by planets forming in the disks; however, a\nquantitative relation between the arm-to-disk brightness contrast and planet\nmass is still missing. Using 3D hydrodynamics and radiative transfer\nsimulations, we examine the morphology and contrast of planet-induced arms in\ndisks. We find a power-law relation for the face-on arm contrast ($\\delta_{\\rm\nmax}$) as a function of planet mass ($M_{\\rm p}$) and disk aspect ratio\n($h/r$): $\\delta_{\\rm max}\\approx((M_{\\rm p}/M_{\\rm J})/(h/r)^{1.38})^{0.22}$.\nWith current observational capability, at a 30 AU separation, the minimum\nplanet mass for driving detectable arms in a disk around a 1 Myr 1$M_\\odot$\nstar at 140 pc at low inclinations is around Saturn mass. For planets more\nmassive than Neptune masses, they typically drive multiple arms. Therefore in\nobserved disks with spirals, it is unlikely that each spiral arm originates\nfrom a different planet.

The Local Group dwarf galaxies would have similarly evolved with\nbuilding blocks of the Milky Way halo. However, how the chemo-dynamical\nevolution of the building blocks affects the abundance of r-process elements is\nnot yet clear. In this paper, we perform a series of simulations using dwarf\ngalaxy models with various dynamical times and total mass, which determine\nstar-formation histories. We find that galaxies with dynamical times longer\nthan 100 Myr have star formation rates less than $10^{-3} M_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$\nand slowly enrich metals in their early phase. These galaxies can explain the\nobserved large scatters of r-process abundance in EMP stars in the Milky Way\nhalo regardless of their total mass. On the other hand, the first neutron star\nmerger appears at a higher metallicity in galaxies with a dynamical time\nshorter than typical neutron star merger times. The scatters of r-process\nelements mainly come from inhomogeneity of the metals in the interstellar\nmedium whereas the scatters of $\\alpha$-elements are mostly due to the\ndifference in the yield of each supernova. Our results demonstrate that the\nfuture observations of r-process elements in EMP stars will be able to\nconstrain the early chemo-dynamical evolution of the Local Group galaxies. \n\n"}

A\nsystematic statistical study of magnetic tornadoes is a necessary next step\ntowards understanding their formation and their role for the mass and energy\ntransport in the solar atmosphere.

Our direct numerical simulations indicate that the dynamo is\npossible in both cases, given a large enough magnetic Reynolds number.

In this paper, we investigate\nobservational constraints on different phenomenological interacting dark energy\n(IDE) models with the intermediate-luminosity radio quasars acting as\nindividual standard rulers, combined with the newest BAO and CMB observation\nfrom Planck results acting as statistical rulers. The results obtained from the\nMCMC method and other statistical methods including Figure of Merit and\nInformation Criteria show that: (1) Compared with the current standard candle\ndata and standard clock data, the intermediate-luminosity radio quasar standard\nrulers , probing much higher redshifts, could provide comparable constraints on\ndifferent IDE scenarios. (2) The interaction between dark energy and dark\nmatter seems to be vanishing or slightly smaller than zero.

Macronovae are caused by the\nradioactivity from freshly synthesised heavy elements, e.g. from dynamic ejecta\nand various types of winds. We study macronova signatures by using\nmulti-dimensional radiative transfer calculations. We employ the radiative\ntransfer code SuperNu and state-of-the-art LTE opacities for a few\nrepresentative elements from the wind and dynamical ejecta (Cr, Pd, Se, Te, Br,\nZr, Sm, Ce, Nd, U) to calculate synthetic light curves and spectra for a range\nof ejecta morphologies. The radioactive power of the resulting macronova is\ncalculated with the detailed input of decay products. We assess the detection\nprospects for our most complex models, based on the portion of viewing angles\nthat are sufficiently bright, at different cosmological redshifts ($z$). The\nbrighter emission from the wind is unobscured by the lanthanides (or actinides)\nin some of the models, permitting non-zero detection probabilities for\nredshifts up to $z=0.07$. We also find the nuclear mass model and the resulting\nradioactive heating rate are crucial for the detectability. While for the most\npessimistic heating rate (from the FRDM model) no reasonable increase in the\nejecta mass or velocity, or wind mass or velocity, can possibly make the light\ncurves agree with the observed nIR excess after GRB130603B, a more optimistic\nheating rate (from the Duflo-Zuker model) leads to good agreement.

We present here 3D numerical simulations of jet propagation in\nmergers' outflows and we calculate the resulting emission. This emission\nconsists of two components: the cooling emission, the leakage of the thermal\nenergy of the hot cocoon, and the cocoon macronova that arises from the\nradioactive decay of the cocoon's material. This emission gives a brief (~ one\nhour) blue, wide angle signal. While the parameters of the outflow and jet are\nuncertain, for the configurations we have considered the signal is bright (~\n-14 $-$ -15 absolute magnitude) and outshines all other predicted UV-optical\nsignals.

For studying the combined effect of time-varying\nmagnetic fields and kinematics, we solved the 1.5D NLTE problem of the second\nkind in time-dependent 3D R-MHD solar models and we synthesized the Hanle and\nZeeman polarization in forward scattering for the chromospheric {\\lambda}4227\nline.

Most of the previous studies have focused on Sweet-Parker current\nsheets, which, however, are unattainable in typical astrophysical systems.\nHere, we derive a general set of scaling laws for the plasmoid instability in\nresistive and visco-resistive current sheets that evolve over time. Our method\nrelies on a principle of least time that enables us to determine the properties\nof the reconnecting current sheet (aspect ratio and elapsed time) and the\nplasmoid instability (growth rate, wavenumber, inner layer width) at the end of\nthe linear phase.

X-ray observations of these systems reveal an\noptically thin boundary layer (BL) expected to appear as an inner hole in the\ndisk. Consequently, we truncate the inner disk. However, instead of removing\nthe inner disk, we impose the no-shear boundary condition at the truncation\nradius, thereby lowering the disk temperature and generating a spectrum that\nbetter fits the UV data. With our modified disk, we analyze the archival UV\nspectra of three novalikes that cannot be fitted with standard disks. For the\nVY Scl systems MV Lyr and BZ Cam, we fit a hot inflated white dwarf WD with a\ncold modified disk ($\\dot{M} \\sim $ a few $10^{-9}M_{\\odot}$/yr). For V592 Cas,\nthe slightly modified disk ($\\dot{M} \\sim 6 \\times 10^{-9}M_{\\odot}$/yr)\ncompletely dominates the UV.

It goes under the name of ${\\Lambda}$CDM.\nHowever, there are still challenging questions that remain unanswered by this\nmodel, such as what causes the observed accelerated expansion of the universe,\nand many alternatives have been proposed. This thesis concerns an approach to\ntest such models known as \"Effective Theory of Dark Energy\" . It applies to all\nmodels where general relativity is modified by adding a single scalar degree of\nfreedom, called \"scalar-tensor theories\". In Chapter 1 I summarise the most\ngeneral class of such theories currently known, called \"Degenerate higher-Order\nScalar-Tensor\" (DHOST) theories. In Chapter 2, I introduce the effective theory\nof dark energy. The inclusion of a general coupling between matter and the\ngravitational sector is the subject of Chapter 3. Chapter 4 analyses in details\nthe stability of different classes of theories. Notably, I show that the most\ngeneral class of theories free from instabilities reduces to the so-called\nHorndeski and beyond-Horndeski theories, up to a non minimal coupling to\nmatter. Another goal of the thesis is to study the observable effects of\ndeviations from ${\\Lambda}$CDM. In Chapter 5, I consider the possibility of an\ninteraction between dark matter and dark energy and I analyse the constraining\npower of future surveys on the free parameters of the theory. Chapter 6 focuses\non the observational effects of theories where a kinetic mixing between matter\nand the scalar field exists.

Widespread circular polarisation Abstract: We analyse the circular polarisation data accumulated in the first 7 years of\nthe POLAMI project introduced in an accompanying paper (Agudo et al.). In the\n3mm wavelength band, we acquired more than 2600 observations, and all but one\nof our 37 sample sources were detected, most of them several times. For most\nsources, the observed distribution of the degree of circular polarisation is\nbroader than that of unpolarised calibrators, indicating that weak (<0.5%)\ncircular polarisation is present most of the time. Our detection rate and the\nmaximum degree of polarisation found, 2.0%, are comparable to previous surveys,\nall made at much longer wavelengths. We argue that the process generating\ncircular polarisation must not be strongly wavelength dependent, and we propose\nthat the widespread presence of circular polarisation in our short wavelength\nsample dominated by blazars is mostly due to Faraday conversion of the linearly\npolarised synchrotron radiation in the helical magnetic field of the jet.\nCircular polarisation is variable, most notably on time scales comparable to or\nshorter than our median sampling interval <1 month. Longer time scales of about\none year are occasionally detected, but severely limited by the weakness of the\nsignal. At variance with some longer wavelength investigations we find that the\nsign of circular polarisation changes in most sources, while only 7 sources,\nincluding 3 already known, have a strong preference for one sign. The degrees\nof circular and linear polarisation do not show any systematic correlation. We\ndo find however one particular event where the two polarisation degrees vary in\nsynchronism during a time span of 0.9 years. The paper also describes a novel\nmethod for calibrating the sign of circular polarisation observations. \n\n"}

A decrease in the covering factor of the\ncircumnuclear material with increasing accretion rates has been found by\nstudies carried out across the electromagnetic spectrum. The origin of this\ntrend has been suggested to be driven either by the increase in the inner\nradius of the obscuring material with incident luminosity due to the\nsublimation of dust; by the gravitational potential of the black hole; by\nradiative feedback; or by the interplay between outflows and inflows.

We analyse bolometric and NIR lightcurves of the first detected double\nneutron star merger and compare them to nuclear reaction network-based\nmacronova models. The slope of the bolometric lightcurve is consistent with the\nradioactive decay of neutron star ejecta with $Y_e \\lesssim 0.3$ (but not\nlarger), which provides strong evidence for an r-process origin of the\nelectromagnetic emission. This rules out in particular \"nickel winds\" as major\nsource of the emission. We find that the NIR lightcurves can be well fitted\neither with or without lanthanide-rich ejecta. Our limits on the ejecta mass\ntogether with estimated rates directly confirm earlier purely theoretical or\nindirect observational conclusions that double neutron star mergers are indeed\na major site of cosmic nucleosynthesis.

Recently, the first DAMPE results on the CRE flux hinted at a narrow\nexcess at energy ~1.4 TeV. We show that in general a spectral structure with a\nnarrow width appears in two scenarios: I) \"Spectrum broadening\" for the\ncontinuous sources with a delta-function-like injection spectrum. In this\nscenario, a finite width can develop after propagation through the Galaxy,\nwhich can reveal the distance of the source. Well-motivated sources include\nmini-spikes and subhalos formed by dark matter (DM) particles $\\chi_{s}$ which\nannihilate directly into e+e- pairs. II) \"Phase-space shrinking\" for burst-like\nsources with a power-law-like injection spectrum. The spectrum after\npropagation can shrink at a cooling-related cutoff energy and form a sharp\nspectral peak. The peak can be more prominent due to the energy-dependent\ndiffusion. In this scenario, the width of the excess constrains both the power\nindex and the distance of the source. Possible such sources are pulsar wind\nnebulae (PWNe) and supernova remnants (SNRs). We analysis the DAMPE excess and\nfind that the continuous DM sources should be fairly close within ~0.3 kpc, and\nthe annihilation cross sections are close to the thermal value. For the\nburst-like source, the narrow width of the excess suggests that the injection\nspectrum must be hard with power index significantly less than two, the\ndistance is within ~(3-4) kpc, and the age of the source is ~0.16 Myr. In both\nscenarios, large anisotropies in the CRE flux are predicted. We identify\npossible candidates of mini-spike (PWN) sources in the current Fermi-LAT 3FGL\n(ATNF) catalog. The diffuse gamma-rays from these sources can be well below the\nGalactic diffuse gamma-ray backgrounds and less constrained by the Ferm-LAT\ndata, if they are located at the low Galactic latitude regions. \n\n"}

The case\n  of electron scattering Abstract: Bow shocks and related density enhancements produced by the winds of massive\nstars moving through the interstellar medium provide important information\nregarding the motions of the stars, the properties of their stellar winds, and\nthe characteristics of the local medium. Since bow shocks are aspherical\nstructures, light scattering within them produces a net polarization signal\neven if the region is spatially unresolved. Scattering opacity arising from\nfree electrons and dust leads to a distribution of polarized intensity across\nthe bow shock structure.

The metal-rich inclusions in the bi-abundance model occupy 5.6\npercent of the total volume of the nebula, and are roughly 1.7 times cooler and\ndenser than the mean values of the surrounding nebula. The N/H and O/H\nabundance ratios in the metal-rich inclusions are ~ 1.0 and 1.7 dex larger than\nthe diffuse warm nebula, respectively.

As mass transfer runs away at increasing rates, gas\ntrails away from the binary.

By using\nthis model, we estimated the FRB detection rate for two Indian radio telescope;\nthe Ooty Wide Field Array (OWFA) (Bhattacharyya {\\em et al.}, 2017) and the\nupgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) (Bhattacharyya {\\em et al.},\n2018) with three beam forming modes. In this review article, I summarize these\ntwo works. We considered the energy spectrum of FRBs as a power law and the\nenergy distribution of FRBs as a Dirac delta function and a Schechter\nluminosity function. We also considered two scattering models proposed by Bhat\n{\\em et al.} (2004) and Macquart \\& Koay (2013) for these work and I consider\nFRB pulse without scattering as a special case for this review. We found that\nthe future prospects of detecting FRBs by using these two Indian radio\ntelescopes is good. They are capable to detect a significant number of FRBs per\nday. According to our prediction, we can detect $\\sim 10^5-10^8$, $\\sim\n10^3-10^6$ and $\\sim 10^5-10^7$ FRBs per day by using OWFA, commensal systems\nof GMRT and uGMRT respectively.

Thus, all low-frequency ion\nheating in such plasmas is due to compressive fluctuations (\"slow modes\").\nBecause these fluctuations energetically decouple from the Alfv\\'enic ones\nalready in the inertial range, the above conclusion means that the energy\npartition between ions and electrons in low-beta plasmas is decided at the\nouter scale, where turbulence is launched, and can be determined from\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models of the relevant astrophysical systems. Any\nadditional ion heating must come from non-gyrokinetic mechanisms such as\ncyclotron heating or the stochastic heating owing to distortions of ions'\nLarmor orbits. An exception to these conclusions occurs in the Hall limit,\ni.e., when the ratio of the ion to electron temperatures is as low as the ion\nbeta (equivalently, the electron beta is order unity). In this regime, slow\nmodes couple to Alfv\\'enic ones well above the Larmor scale (viz., at the ion\ninertial or ion sound scale), so the Alfv\\'enic and compressive cascades join\nand then separate again into two cascades of fluctuations that linearly\nresemble kinetic Alfv\\'en and ion cyclotron waves, with the former heating\nelectrons and the latter ions. The two cascades are shown to decouple, scalings\nfor them are derived, and it is argued physically that the two species will be\nheated by them at approximately equal rates. \n\n"}

Understanding the progenitors and the\nmechanism driving SN Ic-bl explosions vs those of their SNe Ic cousins is key\nto understanding the SN-GRB relationship and jet production in massive stars.\nHere we present the largest set of host-galaxy spectra of 28 SNe Ic and 14 SN\nIc-bl, all discovered before 2013 by the same untargeted survey, namely the\nPalomar Transient Factory (PTF). We carefully measure their gas-phase\nmetallicities, stellar masses (M*s) and star-formation rates (SFRs) by taking\ninto account recent progress in the metallicity field and propagating\nuncertainties correctly. We further re-analyze the hosts of 10 literature\nSN-GRBs using the same methods and compare them to our PTF SN hosts with the\ngoal of constraining their progenitors from their local environments by\nconducting a thorough statistical comparison, including upper limits. We find\nthat the metallicities, SFRs and M*s of our PTF SN Ic-bl hosts are\nstatistically comparable to those of SN-GRBs, but significantly lower than\nthose of the PTF SNe Ic. The mass-metallicity relations as defined by the SNe\nIc-bl and SN-GRBs are not significantly different from the same relations as\ndefined by the SDSS galaxies, in contrast to claims by earlier works.

However, spatially correlated sources of\nnoise, such as errors in the planetary ephemeris or clock errors, can produce\nfalse-positive correlations.

We explore the nucleosynthesis of helium cores in\nthe mass range M_He=64 to 133 Msun, corresponding to main-sequence star masses\nof approximately 140 to 260 M_sun. Above M_He=133 M_sun, without rotation and\nusing current reaction rates, a black hole is formed and no nucleosynthesis is\nejected. For lighter helium core masses, ~40 to 63 M_sun, violent pulsations\noccur, induced by the pair instability and accompanied by supernova-like mass\nejection, but the star eventually produces a large iron core in hydrostatic\nequilibrium. It is likely that this core, too, collapses to a black hole, thus\ncleanly separating the heavy element nucleosynthesis of pair instability\nsupernovae from those of other masses, both above and below. Indeed, black hole\nformation is a likely outcome for all Population III stars with main sequence\nmasses between about 25 M_sun and 140 M_sun (M_He = 9 to 63 M_sun) as well as\nthose above 260 M_sun. Nucleosynthesis in pair-instability supernovae varies\ngreatly with the mass of the helium core which determines the maximum\ntemperature reached during the bounce. At the upper range of exploding core\nmasses, a maximum of 57 M_sun of Ni56 is produced making these the most\nenergetic and the brightest thermonuclear explosions in the universe.\nIntegrating over a distribution of masses, we find that pair instability\nsupernovae produce a roughly solar distribution of nuclei having even nuclear\ncharge, but are remarkably deficient in producing elements with odd nuclear\ncharge. Also, essentially no elements heavier than zinc are produced due to a\nlack of s- and r-processes. \n\n"}

These components are identified\nwith the expanding circumstellar (CS) envelope (Sollerman, Cumming & Lundqvist\n1998), shocked cool gas in the forward postshock region, and multiple Thomson\nscattering in the CS envelope, respectively. The absence of broad P Cygni lines\nfrom the supernova (SN) is the result of the formation of an optically thick,\ncool, dense shell at the interface of the ejecta and the CS envelope. Models of\nthe SN deceleration and Thomson scattering wings are used to recover the\nThomson optical depth of the CS envelope and its radial extent, 4E15 cm. The\nlight curve, which we reproduce by a hydrodynamical model, is powered by a\ncombination of internal energy leakage after the explosion of an extended\npresupernova (~1E15 cm) and luminosity from circumstellar interaction. We\nrecover the pre-explosion kinematics of the CS envelope and find it to be close\nto homologous expansion with outmost velocity ~1100 km/s and a kinematic age of\n\\~1.5 yr. The high mass and kinetic energy of the CS envelope strongly suggest\nthat the CS envelope was explosively ejected only a few years before explosion. \n\n"}

For magnetar-strength ($\\sim10^{15}$ G) large scale\nsurface magnetic fields, this outflow is magnetically-dominated during the\nentire cooling epoch.Because the strong magnetic field forces the wind to\nco-rotate with the protoneutron star,this outflow can significantly effect the\nneutron star's early angular momentum evolution, as in analogous models of\nstellar winds (e.g. Weber & Davis 1967). If the rotational energy is large in\ncomparison with the supernova energy and the spindown timescale is short with\nrespect to the time required for the supernova shockwave to traverse the\nstellar progenitor, the energy extracted may modify the supernova shock\ndynamics significantly. This effect is capable of producing hyper-energetic\nsupernovae and, in some cases, provides conditions favorable for gamma ray\nbursts.

It is\ntherefore interesting to explore whether short duration events also have ejecta\npowered by radioactivity (i.e. that are supernova-like).

We consider both\nmonopole and dipole magnetic field geometries and we explore the parameter\nregime extending from low magnetization (low-sigma_o), almost thermally-driven\nwinds to high magnetization (high-sigma_o), relativistic Poynting-flux\ndominated outflows. We compute the angular momentum and rotational energy loss\nrates as a function of sigma_o and compare with analytic expectations from the\nclassical theory of pulsars and magnetized stellar winds. In the case of the\nmonopole, our high-sigma_o calculations asymptotically approach the analytic\nforce-free limit. If we define the spindown rate in terms of the open magnetic\nflux, we similarly reproduce the spindown rate from recent force-free\ncalculations of the aligned dipole.

In order for a massive star to become a\nWR star, it must shed its H envelope, but new estimates of the effects of\nclumping in winds indicate that line driving is vastly insufficient. We discuss\nmassive stars above roughly 40-50 Msun, for which the best alternative is mass\nloss during brief eruptions of luminous blue variables (LBVs). Our clearest\nexample of this phenomenon is the 19th century outburst of eta Car, when the\nstar shed 12-20 Msun or more in less than a decade. Other examples are\ncircumstellar nebulae of LBVs, extragalactic eta Car analogs (``supernova\nimpostors''), and massive shells around SNe and GRBs. We do not yet fully\nunderstand what triggers LBV outbursts, but they occur nonetheless, and present\na fundamental mystery in stellar astrophysics. Since line opacity from metals\nbecomes too saturated, the extreme mass loss probably arises from a\ncontinuum-driven wind or a hydrodynamic explosion, both of which are\ninsensitive to metallicity. As such, eruptive mass loss could have played a\npivotal role in the evolution and fate of massive metal-poor stars in the early\nuniverse.
