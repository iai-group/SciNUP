In\ncontrast to previous studies we find that the necessary procedure of redefining\nthe fields in order to restore canonically normalised kinetic terms, i.e.\ncanonical normalisation, can lead to significant corrections to the fermion\nmixing angles (as determined from the superpotential).

{"id": "1103.0986", "contents": "Title: Xenon Recirculation-Purification with a Heat Exchanger Abstract: Liquid-xenon based particle detectors have been dramatically growing in size\nduring the last years, and are now exceeding the one-ton scale. The required\nhigh xenon purity is usually achieved by continuous recirculation of xenon gas\nthrough a high-temperature getter. This challenges the traditional way of\ncooling these large detectors, since in a thermally well insulated detector,\nmost of the cooling power is spent to compensate losses from recirculation. The\nphase change during recondensing requires five times more cooling power than\ncooling the gas from ambient temperature to -100C (173 K). Thus, to reduce the\ncooling power requirements for large detectors, we propose to use the heat from\nthe purified incoming gas to evaporate the outgoing xenon gas, by means of a\nheat exchanger. Generally, a heat exchanger would appear to be only of very\nlimited use, since evaporation and liquefaction occur at zero temperature\ndifference. However, the use of a recirculation pump reduces the pressure of\nthe extracted liquid, forces it to evaporate, and thus cools it down. We show\nthat this temperature difference can be used for an efficient heat exchange\nprocess. We investigate the use of a commercial parallel plate heat exchanger\nwith a small liquid xenon detector. Although we expected to be limited by the\navailable cooling power to flow rates of about 2 SLPM, rates in excess of 12\nSLPM can easily be sustained, limited only by the pump speed and the impedance\nof the flow loop. The heat exchanger operates with an efficiency of (96.8 +/-\n0.5)%. This opens the possibility for fast xenon gas recirculation in\nlarge-scale experiments, while minimizing thermal losses. \n\n"}

External backgrounds would be shielded by the buffer of\nnatural LXe, leaving the ultra-radiopure internal volume virtually free of\nbackground.\n  Industrial graphene can be manufactured at a competitive cost to produce the\nsphere. Enriching xenon in the isotope Xe-136 is easy and relatively cheap, and\nthere is already near one ton of enriched xenon available in the world\n(currently being used by the EXO, KamLAND-Zen and NEXT experiments). All the\ncryogenic know-how is readily available from the numerous experiments using\nliquid xenon. An experiment using the GraXe concept appears realistic and\naffordable in a short time scale, and its physics potential is enormous. \n\n"}

When the\nhierarchy is large, a low energy effective field theory (EFT) exists in which\nonly curvature modes participate in the dynamics of perturbations. In this EFT\nheavy fields continue to have a significant role in the low energy dynamics, as\ntheir interaction with curvature modes reduces their speed of sound whenever\nthe multi-field trajectory is subject to a sharp turn in target space. Here we\nanalyze under which general conditions this EFT remains a reliable description\nfor the linear evolution of curvature modes. We find that the main condition\nconsists on demanding that the rate of change of the turn's angular velocity\nstays suppressed with respect to the masses of heavy modes. This adiabaticity\ncondition allows the EFT to accurately describe a large variety of situations\nin which the multi-field trajectory is subject to sharp turns. To test this, we\nanalyze several models with turns and show that, indeed, the power spectra\nobtained for both the original two-field theory and its single-field EFT are\nidentical when the adiabaticity condition is satisfied. In particular, when\nturns are sharp and sudden, they are found to generate large features in the\npower spectrum, accurately reproduced by the EFT. \n\n"}

In such statistically limited searches,\ndatasets are often amassed over periods of several years, during which the\ntrigger characteristics evolve and system performance can vary significantly.\nReliable production cross-section measurements and upper limits must take into\naccount a detailed understanding of the effective trigger inefficiency for\nevery selected candidate event. We present as an example the complex situation\nof three trigger chains, based on missing energy and jet energy, that were\ncombined in the context of the search for the Higgs (H) boson produced in\nassociation with a $W$ boson at the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF).

In the broken phase a light Higgs turns\nout to be natural as it appears self-protected and self-tuned by the\nspontaneous symmetry breaking.

Thus the existence of quadratic cutoff effects in the SM\ncannot motivate the need for a super symmetric extensions of the SM, but in\ncontrast plays an important role in triggering the electroweak phase transition\nat a scale about 10^{17} GeV and in shaping the Higgs potential in the early\nuniverse to drive inflation as supported by observation.

We discuss the idea of using the\nMAC-E-Filter in a time-of-flight mode (MAC-E-TOF) in which the neutrino mass is\ndetermined by a measurement of the electron time-of-flight (TOF) spectrum that\ndepends on the neutrino mass. MAC-E-TOF spectroscopy here is a very sensitive\nmethod since the $\\beta$-electrons are slowed down to distinguishable\nvelocities by the MAC-E-Filter. Their velocity depends strongly on their\nsurplus energy above the electric retarding potential. Using MAC-E-TOF, a\nstatistical sensitivity gain is expected.

The proposal is to install a LHCf-like\ncalorimeter in the ZDC installation slot at one of the RHIC interaction points.\nBy installing a high-resolution electromagnetic calorimeter at this location we\nmeasure the spectra of photons, neutrons and pi0 at pseudo rapidity eta above\n6.\n  The new measurements at 500 GeV p-p collisions contribute to improve the\nhadronic interaction models used in the cosmic-ray air shower simulations.\nUsing a similar kinematic coverage at RHIC to that of the measurements at LHC,\nwe can test the Feynman scaling with a wide energy range and make the\nextrapolation of models into cosmic-ray energy more reliable. Combination of a\nhigh position resolution of the LHCf detector and a high energy resolution of\nthe ZDC makes it possible to determine pT of forward neutrons with the ever\nbest resolution. This enables us to study the forward neutron spin asymmetry\ndiscovered at RHIC in more detail.\n  Another new experiment expected at RHIC is world-first light-ion collisions.\nCosmic-ray interaction models have been so far tested with accelerator data,\nbut colliders have provided only p-p and heavy-ion collisions. To simulate the\ninteraction between cosmic-ray particles and atmosphere, collision of light\nions like nitrogen is a ultimate goal for the cosmic-ray physics.

In the LHC Run 1, this trigger, which\nutilized a custom boosted decision tree algorithm, selected a nearly 100% pure\nsample of b-hadrons with a typical efficiency of 60-70%; its output was used in\nabout 60% of LHCb papers.

We\ncalculate the spectral functions $\\rho_{\\sigma, \\pi}(\\omega,\\, p)$ in the\nscalar ($\\sigma$) and pseudoscalar ($\\pi$) channels beyond the random phase\napproximation in the quark--meson model. At finite baryon chemical potential\n$\\mu$ with a finite quark mass, the baryon-number fluctuation is coupled to the\nscalar channel and the spectral function in the $\\sigma$ channel has a support\nnot only in the time-like ($\\omega\\,>\\,p$) but also in the space-like\n($\\omega\\,<\\, p$) regions, which correspond to the mesonic and the\nparticle--hole phonon excitations, respectively. We find that the energy of the\npeak position of the latter becomes vanishingly small with the height being\nenhanced as the system approaches the QCD critical point, which is a\nmanifestation of the fact that the phonon mode is the {\\em soft mode}\nassociated with the second-order transition at the QCD critical point, as has\nbeen suggested by some authors.

The role of e-ion recombination is\ndiscussed for both parent recombination and volume recombination. We find that\nthe volume recombination under non-zero field is constrained by a plasma\neffect, which is caused by a high density of charge carriers along the\nionization track forming a plasma-like cloud of charge that shields the\ninterior from the influence of the external electric field. Subsequently, the\nplasma time that determines the volume recombination probability at non-zero\nfield is demonstrated to be different between electronic recoils and nuclear\nrecoils due to the difference of ionization density between two processes. We\nshow a weak field-dependence of the plasma time for nuclear recoils and a\nstronger field-dependence of the plasma time for electronic recoils.

These\nmuon counters modules comprise sealed PVC casings containing plastic\nscintillation bars, wavelength-shifter optical fibers, 64 pixel photomultiplier\ntubes, and acquisition electronics. The modules are buried approximately 2.25 m\nbelow ground level in order to minimize contamination from electromagnetic\nshower particles. The mechanical setup, which allows access to the electronics\nfor maintenance, is also described in addition to tests of the modules'\nresponse and integrity. The completed Unitary Cell has measured a number of air\nshowers of which a first analysis of a sample event is included here. \n\n"}

In this picture, a\nheavy quarkonium core resides within a light hadron giving rise to four- or\nfive-quark/antiquark bound states.

The low density of the gas leads to very low track energy\nthresholds, allowing the reconstruction of very low momentum tracks, e.g.\nprotons with kinetic energies down to $\\mathcal{O}$(1 MeV). Since different\nnuclear interaction models vary considerably in their predictions of those low\nmomentum track multiplicities, this makes neutrino interactions on gases a\npowerful probe to test those models. The TPCs operate with an argon-based gas\nmixture (95% by volume) and have been exposed to the T2K neutrino beam since\nthe beginning of the experiment in 2010.

We construct the Floquet charts to find regions of parameter\nspace in which particle production is efficient for both the adiabatic and\nisocurvature modes, and analyze the resonance structure using analytic and\nsemi-analytic techniques. Particle production in the adiabatic direction is\ncharacterized by the existence of an asymptotic scaling solution at large\nvalues of the nonminimal couplings, $\\xi_I \\gg 1$, in which the dominant\ninstability band arises in the long-wavelength limit, for comoving wavenumbers\n$k \\rightarrow 0$. However, the large-$\\xi_I$ regime is not reached until\n$\\xi_I \\geq {\\cal O} (100)$. In the intermediate regime, with $\\xi_I \\sim {\\cal\nO}(1 - 10)$, the resonance structure depends strongly on wavenumber and\ncouplings.

The high density of hits on a given particle track facilitates the task\nof pattern recognition in a high-occupancy environment and in addition provides\nparticle identification by measuring the specific energy loss for each track.\nFor these reasons, TPCs with Multiwire Proportional Chamber (MWPC)\namplification have been and are widely used in experiments recording heavy-ion\ncollisions. A significant drawback, however, is the large dead time of the\norder of 1 ms per event generated by the use of a gating grid, which is\nmandatory to prevent ions created in the amplification region from drifting\nback into the drift volume, where they would severely distort the drift path of\nsubsequent tracks. For experiments with higher event rates this concept of a\nconventional TPC operating with a triggered gating grid can therefore not be\napplied without a significant loss of data. A continuous readout of the signals\nis the more appropriate way of operation. This, however, constitutes a change\nof paradigm with considerable challenges to be met concerning the amplification\nregion, the design and bandwidth of the readout electronics, and the data\nhandling.

In order to ensure that these chambers are stable while being\noperated at the LHC, studies of the discharge behaviour were performed. We\nreport on studies done with small prototypes equipped with one or two GEMs.\nDischarges were voluntarily induced by a combination of high-voltages across\nthe GEM(s) and highly ionising particles.

The\ntime between the initial and the secondary discharge ranges from several 10 us\nto less than 1 us, decreasing with increasing field.

This was done by fitting a model built in COMSOL\nMultiphysics to the uniformly distributed calibration data that were collected\non a regular basis. The modeled average PTFE charge density increased over the\ncourse of the exposure from -3.6 to $-5.5~\\mu$C/m$^2$. From our studies, we\ndeduce that the electric field magnitude varied while the mean value of the\nfield of $\\sim200$~V/cm remained constant throughout the exposure.

Also the UCN\ntransparency of the bulk sD_2 material must be high because crystal\ninhomogeneities limit the mean free path for elastic scattering and reduce the\nextraction efficiency. Observations at the UCN sources at Paul Scherrer\nInstitute and at Los Alamos National Laboratory consistently show a decrease of\nthe UCN yield with time of operation after initial preparation or later\ntreatment (`conditioning') of the sD_2.

To\nmeet the physics goals, the vertex and tracking detectors require not only a\nspatial resolution of a few micrometers and a very low material budget, but\nalso timing capabilities with a precision of a few nanoseconds to allow\nsuppression of beam-induced backgrounds.\n  Different technologies using hybrid silicon detectors are explored for the\nvertex detectors, such as dedicated readout ASICs, small-pitch active edge\nsensors as well as capacitively coupled High-Voltage CMOS sensors.

We provide very simple and\nreadable analytical formulae, both for the spectra of the created fermions and\nfor their total energy density. Their derivation is closely related to the one\nadopted for bosons and exploits the fact that the production occurs during very\nshort intervals of nonadiabatical change of the fermionic frequency.

The significance of diquarks\nin that application motivates a study of the possibility that dense hadronic\nmatter may exhibit diquark condensation; i.e., quark-quark pairing promoted by\na quark chemical potential. A Gorkov-Nambu-like gap equation is introduced for\nQCD and analysed for 2-colour QCD (QC2D) and, in two qualitatively different\ntruncations, for QCD itself. Among other interesting features, we illustrate\nthat QC2D with massive fermions undergoes a second-order transition to a\nsuperfluid phase when the chemical potential exceeds 0.5 m.pi. In the QCD\napplication we illustrate that the sigma= <bar-q q> .neq. 0 phase, which\ndetermines the properties of the mass spectrum at zero temperature and chemical\npotential, is unstable with respect to the superfluid phase when the chemical\npotential exceeds approx. 2 sigma, and that at this point the diquark gap is\nlarge, approx. 0.5 sigma. The superfluid phase survives to temperatures greater\nthan that expected in the core of compact stars. \n\n"}

We provide a simple qualitative explanation of the effect which\nshows that it is not caused predominantly by edge effects. We also show that it\nis quite insensitive to ``details'' of the unintegrated gluon distribution\nfunctions such as the presence of leading-twist shadowing and of an extended\ngeometric scaling window. The larger eccentricity increases the azimuthal\nasymmetry of high transverse momentum particles. Finally, we point out that the\nlongitudinal structure of the Color Glass Condensate initial condition for\nhydrodynamics away from midrapidity is non-trivial but requires understanding\nof large-$x$ effects. \n\n"}

The only adjustable parameter\nrequired is the shift in rapidity of a produced charged meson when it\nencounters a target nucleon. Its fitted value is 0.16. Next, we apply this\nlinear extrapolation to precisely measured Drell-Yan cross sections for 800 GeV\nprotons incident on a variety of nuclear targets which exhibit a deviation from\nlinear scaling in the atomic number A. We show that this deviation can be\naccounted for by energy degradation of the proton as it passes through the\nnucleus if account is taken of the time delay of particle production due to\nquantum coherence. We infer an average proper coherence time of 0.4 +/- 0.1\nfm/c, corresponding to a coherence path length of 8 +/- 2 fm in the rest frame\nof the nucleus. Finally, we apply the linear extrapolation to measured J/Psi\nproduction cross sections for 200 and 450 GeV/c protons incident on a variety\nof nuclear targets. Our analysis takes into account energy loss of the beam\nproton, the time delay of particle production due to quantum coherence, and\nabsorption of the J/Psi on nucleons. The best representation is obtained for a\ncoherence time of 0.5 fm/c, which is consistent with Drell-Yan production, and\nan absorption cross section of 3.6 mb, which is consistent with the value\ndeduced from photoproduction of the J/Psi on nuclear targets. \n\n"}

The perturbation series exhibits a\nrich singularity structure in the Borel plane. Resummation methods are\npresented which appear to lead to consistent results even in problematic cases\nwhere isolated singularities or branch cuts are present on the positive and\nnegative real axis in the Borel plane. Two resummation prescriptions are\ncompared: (i) a variant of the Borel-Pade resummation method, with an\nadditional improvement due to utilization of the leading renormalon poles (for\na comprehensive discussion of renormalons see [M. Beneke, Phys.
