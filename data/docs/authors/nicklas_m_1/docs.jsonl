However, an early suggestion of one of us (Baskaran) was\nunique in the sense it combined Pauling's classic idea of resonating valence\nbond physics with band theory to obtain some exciting results for\nsuperconductivity. Black-Schaffer and Doniach took this approach further and\nfound an unconventional d + id order parameter. To sharpen our theory and get\nmore convincing and reliable results for superconductivity, we introduce a\ncorrelated variational BCS ground state wavefunction and perform extensive\nMonte Carlo study of the repulsive Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice. We\nfind that undoped graphene is not a superconductor, consistent with experiments\nand also mean field results. Interestingly, an appreciable superconducting\norder is obtained around an optimal doping. This result and a supportive slave\nparticle analysis together suggest the possibility of high temperature\nsuperconductivity in doped graphene. \n\n"}

The goal of the paper is two-fold.\nFirst, we analyze the dependence of W on the upper cut-off w_c placed on the\noptical integral because in experiments W is measured up to frequencies of\norder bandwidth. For a BCS model, the Kubo sum rule is almost fully reproduced\nat w_c equal to the bandwidth.

The\nderived phase diagram shows that charge stripe order (CO) coexists with bulk\nsuperconductivity in a broad range of doping around x=1/8, although the CO\norder parameter falls off quickly for x<>1/8. Except for x=0.155, the onset of\nCO always coincides with the transition between the orthorhombic and the\ntetragonal low temperature structures. The CO transition evolves from a sharp\ndrop at low x to a more gradual transition at higher x, eventually falling\nbelow the structural phase boundary for optimum doping. With respect to the\ninterlayer CO correlations, we find no qualitative change of the stripe\nstacking order as a function of doping, and in-plane and out-of-plane\ncorrelations disappear simultaneously at the transition. Similarly to the CO,\nthe spin stripe order (SO) is also most pronounced at x=1/8. Truly static SO\nsets in below the CO and coincides with the first appearance of in-plane\nsuperconducting correlations at temperatures significantly above the bulk\ntransition to superconductivity (SC). Indications that bulk SC causes a\nreduction of the spin or charge stripe order could not be identified. We argue\nthat CO is the dominant order that is compatible with SC pairing but competes\nwith SC phase coherence.

In both the normal and superconducting (SC)\nstates, the spectrum lacks the 42/m screw symmetry around the (1/2 1/2 L) axis\nthat is implied by the I4/mmm space group. This is manifest both in the\nin-plane anisotropy of the normal- and SC-state spin dynamics and in the\nout-of-plane dispersion of the spin-resonance mode.

The in-plane anisotropy is\ntemperature-independent and can be qualitatively reproduced in normal-state\ndensity-functional-theory calculations without invoking a symmetry-broken\n(\"nematic\") ground state that was previously proposed as an explanation for\nthis effect.

The most remarkable characteristics in LiFeAs gap structure\nwould be that \"the largest gap emerges on the tiny hole-pockets around Z\npoint\". This result had been naturally explained in terms of the\norbital-fluctuation scenario (T. Saito et al., Phys. Rev.

For this purpose, we construct the two possible tight-binding models\nwith finite SOI by referring the bandstructures given by different ARPES\ngroups. In addition, we extend the gap equation for multiorbital systems with\nfinite SOI, and calculate the gap functions by applying the orbital-spin\nfluctuation theory.

In the semimetal\nphase, the Fermi energy crosses only the 0th Landau bands in magnetic fields.\nFor a finite potential range of impurities, it is found that both the\nlongitudinal and transverse magnetoconductivity are positive and linear at the\nWeyl nodes, leading to an anisotropic and negative magnetoresistivity. The\nlongitudinal magnetoconductivity depends on the potential range of impurities.\nThe longitudinal conductivity remains finite at zero field, even though the\ndensity of states vanishes at the Weyl nodes. This work establishes a relation\nbetween the linear magnetoconductivity and the intrinsic topological Weyl\nsemimetal phase. \n\n"}

When the field and the spin-torque concur to favor the P to\nAP transition, the reversal yields monotonic resistance ramps that can be\ninterpreted as a domain wall propagation through the device at velocities of 17\nto 30 nm/ns; smaller cells switch hence faster. When the field hinders the P to\nAP transition, the switching is preceded by repetitive switching attempts,\nduring which the resistance transiently increases until successful reversal\noccurs. At 50 nm, the P to AP switching proceeds reproducibly in 3 ns, with a\nmonotonic increase of the device resistance.

We generalize this concept to a system of extended objects, such as\nstrings and membranes, arguing that such a system can also exhibit localization\nin the presence of sufficiently strong disorder (randomness) in the\nHamiltonian. We show that localization of large extended objects can be mapped\nto a lower-dimensional many-body localization problem. For example, motion of a\nstring involves propagation of point-like signals down its length to keep the\ndifferent segments in causal contact. For sufficiently strong disorder, all\nsuch internal modes will exhibit many-body localization, resulting in the\nlocalization of the entire string. The eigenstates of the system can then be\nconstructed perturbatively through a convergent 'string locator expansion.' We\npropose a type of out-of-time-order string correlator as a diagnostic of such a\nstring localized phase. Localization of other higher-dimensional objects, such\nas membranes, can also be studied through a hierarchical construction by\nmapping onto localization of lower-dimensional objects.

At a higher temperature a peak is seen in the magnetic\nsusceptibility, and changes in symmetry and in transport are seen at other\ncharacteristic temperatures. We report a meta-analysis of all measurements of\ncharacteristic temperatures well above $T_c$ in strontium doped lanthanum\ncuprate (LSCO) and oxygen doped YBCO. The experimental corpus shows that the\npseudogap line is one of a family of four straight lines which stretches across\nthe phase diagram from low to high doping, and from $T_c$ up to $700$ K. These\nlines all originate from a single point near the overdoped limit of the\nsuperconducting phase and increase as doping is reduced.

An alternative view is that the electrons organize into collective\ntextures (e.g. charge and spin stripes) which cannot be mapped onto the\nelectrons in ordinary metals. The phase diagram, a complex function of various\nparameters (temperature, doping and magnetic field), should then be approached\nusing quantum field theories of objects such as textures and strings, rather\nthan point-like electrons. In an external magnetic field, magnetic flux\npenetrates type-II superconductors via vortices, each carrying one flux\nquantum. The vortices form lattices of resistive material embedded in the\nnon-resistive superconductor and can reveal the nature of the ground state -\ne.g. a conventional metal or an ordered, striped phase - which would have\nappeared had superconductivity not intervened.

The\nobservation of a pseudogap, e.g. in ARPES experiments, is a familiar example of\nthis physics. One potential explanation for this behaviour involves preformed\npairs with finite lifetimes existing in the normal state above T$_c$. In this\nway two characteristic temperatures can be established. A higher one T$^*$ at\nwhich pairs begin to form and the actual T$_c$ at which a phase-coherent\nsuperconducting phase is established.\n  In order to test these ideas we have investigated the negative U Hubbard\nmodel in two dimensions in the fully self-consistent ladder approximation at\nlow electron densities. In the non self-consistent version of this theory the\nsystem always shows an instability towards Bose-condensation of infinite\nlifetime pairs.

In\noptimally doped YBCO the fluctuating negative magnetization M_{fl}(H,T) is\nrather well described by an anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau (GL) functional and the\ncurves M_{fl}/sqrt{H} cross at Tc.
