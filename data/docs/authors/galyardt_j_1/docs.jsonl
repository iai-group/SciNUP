{"id": "0704.1049", "contents": "Title: Charmless Three-body Decays of B Mesons Abstract: Charmless 3-body decays of B mesons are studied in the framework of the\nfactorization approach. The nonresonant contributions arising from $B\\to\nP_1P_2$ transitions are evaluated using heavy meson chiral perturbation theory\n(HMChPT). The momentum dependence of nonresonant amplitudes is assumed to be in\nthe exponential form $e^{-\\alpha_{NR}} p_B\\cdot(p_i+p_j)}$ so that the HMChPT\nresults are recovered in the soft meson limit $p_i, p_j\\to 0$. In addition, we\nhave identified another large source of the nonresonant signal in the matrix\nelements of scalar densities, e.g. $<K\\bar K|\\bar ss|0>$, which can be\nconstrained from the decay $\\bar B^0\\to K_SK_SK_S$ or $B^-\\to K^-K_SK_S$. The\nintermediate vector meson contributions to 3-body decays are identified through\nthe vector current, while the scalar meson resonances are mainly associated\nwith the scalar density. Their effects are described in terms of the\nBreit-Wigner formalism. Our main results are: (i) All KKK modes are dominated\nby the nonresonant background. The predicted branching ratios of\n$K^+K^-K_{S(L)}$, $K^+K^-K^-$ and $K^-K_SK_S$ modes are consistent with the\ndata within errors. (ii) Although the penguin-dominated $B^0\\to K^+K^-K_{S}$\ndecay is subject to a potentially significant tree pollution, its effective\n$\\sin 2\\beta$ is very similar to that of the $K_SK_SK_S$ mode. However, direct\nCP asymmetry of the former, being of order -4%, is more prominent than the\nlatter. (iii) For $B\\to K\\pi\\pi$ decays, we found sizable nonresonant\ncontributions in $K^-\\pi^+\\pi^-$ and $\\bar K^0\\pi^+\\pi^-$ modes, in agreement\nwith the Belle measurements but larger than the BaBar result. \n\n"}

The presence of two Higgs doublets allows for natural\nexplanation of small neutrino masses with triplet fermions in the 100 GeV mass\nrange, without fine tuning of the Yukawa couplings to extremely small values.\nThe triplet fermions couple to the gauge bosons and can be thus produced at the\nLHC. We study in detail the effective cross-sections for the production and\nsubsequent decays of these heavy exotic fermions. We show for the first time\nthat the $\\mu$-$\\tau$ flavor symmetry in the low energy neutrino mass matrix\nresults in mixing matrices for the neutral and charged heavy fermions that are\nnot unity and which carry the flavor symmetry pattern. This flavor structure\ncan be observed in the decays of the heavy fermions at LHC. The large Yukawa\ncouplings in our model result in the decay of the heavy fermions into lighter\nleptons and Higgs with a decay rate which is about $10^{11}$ times larger than\nwhat is expected for the one Higgs Type III seesaw model with 100 GeV triplet\nfermions.

Abstract: We study models in which soft supersymmetry-breaking parameters of the MSSM\nbecome universal at some unification scale, $M_{in}$, above the GUT scale,\n$\\mgut$. We assume that the scalar masses and gaugino masses have common\nvalues, $m_0$ and $m_{1/2}$ respectively, at $M_{in}$. We use the\nrenormalization-group equations of the minimal supersymmetric SU(5) GUT to\nevaluate their evolutions down to $\\mgut$, studying their dependences on the\nunknown parameters of the SU(5) superpotential. After displaying some generic\nexamples of the evolutions of the soft supersymmetry-breaking parameters, we\ndiscuss the effects on physical sparticle masses in some specific examples. We\nnote, for example, that near-degeneracy between the lightest neutralino and the\nlighter stau is progressively disfavoured as $M_{in}$ increases. This has the\nconsequence, as we show in $(m_{1/2}, m_0)$ planes for several different values\nof $\\tan \\beta$, that the stau coannihilation region shrinks as $M_{in}$\nincreases, and we delineate the regions of the $(M_{in}, \\tan \\beta)$ plane\nwhere it is absent altogether.

We\nempirically test the robustness of neutrino mass results to these effects by\nseparately analyzing power spectra of red and blue galaxies from the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey (SDSS-II) Data Release 7 (DR7), combined with the CMB\nfive-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP5) data. We consider\nfitting for a range of maximum wavenumber k using twelve different galaxy bias\nmodels. For example, using a new model based on perturbation theory and\nincluding redshift space distortions (Saito et al. 2009), the all-galaxy power\nspectrum combined with WMAP5 for a wavenumber range of k<0.2 Mpc/h yields 95%\nCL sum(m_nu)<0.46 eV.

In particular, we\nexplore the theoretical uncertainties associated with modeling contributions of\nhadronic intermediate states. Taking into account constraints from low- and\nhigh-energy, parity-conserving electroproduction measurements, choosing\ndifferent models for contributions from the non-resonant processes, and\nperforming the corresponding flavor rotations to obtain the electroweak\namplitude, we arrive at an estimate of the uncertainty in the total\ncontribution to the parity-violating asymmetry. At the kinematics of the Q-Weak\nexperiment, we obtain a correction to the asymmetry equivalent to a shift in\nthe proton weak charge of $(0.0054\\pm0.0020)$. This should be compared to the\nvalue of the proton's weak charge of $\\qwp=0.0713\\pm0.0008$ that includes SM\ncontributions at tree level and one-loop radiative corrections. Therefore, we\nobtain a new Standard Model prediction for the parity-violating asymmetry in\nthe kinematics of the Q-Weak experiment of $(0.0767\\pm0.0008\\pm0.0020_{\\gamma\nZ})$. The latter error leads to a relative uncertainty of 2.8% in the\ndetermination of the proton's weak charge, and is dominated by the uncertainty\nin the isospin structure of the inclusive cross section. We argue that future\nparity-violating inelastic $ep$ asymmetry measurements at low-to-moderate $Q^2$\nand $W^2$ could be exploited to reduce the uncertainty associated with the\ndispersion correction. Because the corresponding shift and error bar decrease\nmonotonically with decreasing beam energy, a determination of the proton's weak\ncharge with a lower-energy experiment or measurements of \"isotope ratios\" in\natomic parity-violation could provide a useful cross check on any implications\nfor physics beyond the Standard Model derived from the Q-Weak measurement. \n\n"}

Although the\nanswer is indeed affirmative, traditionally such effects have been considered\nnegligible. We show that for sufficiently light mass eigenstates such processes\ncan become significant over macroscopic length scales. A critical review of the\nhistorical literature reveals various shortcomings of the standard methods;\nspecifically, one finds that they are restricted to states for which the\nexpectation value of momentum vanishes. Furthermore, the results obtained here\ncorrect Feynman's analysis of this subject. A formalism is thus developed that\nallows the description of states with non-zero momentum, which is then applied\nto the OPERA and ICARUS neutrino-speed experiments. For OPERA we choose a mass\nin the nano electron-volt range and find that although our formalism predicts a\nnon-zero detection probability for an early arrival time of 60 ns, the\npredicted event distribution is maximal on the light-cone. Consequently, our\nprediction does not reproduce the peak at 60 ns reported by the OPERA\ncollaboration. Turning to the ICARUS experiment, we note that while the\ncollaboration reported an average time of flight that is consistent with the\nspeed of light, the event data with its associated uncertainties nevertheless\nindicates that some of the detection events are separated from their\ncorresponding emission events by a space-like interval.

Recently Qian et al. have\nclaimed that this goal may be impeded by the strong dependence of the\ndifference parameter RL+PV on the reactor neutrino flux and on slight\nvariations of Delta M^2_32. We demonstrate that this effect results from a\nspurious dependence of the difference parameter on the very high energy (8+\nMeV) tail of the reactor neutrino spectrum. This dependence is spurious because\nthe high energy tail depends upon decays of exotic isotopes and is insensitive\nto the mass hierarchy.

Our proposal exploits the previously\noverlooked advantages of boosted $Z\\rightarrow \\nu \\bar{\\nu}$ topologies, where\ncollimated neutrinos result in signals with large missing energy. We illustrate\nthe advantage of this channel in a case study of singly produced TeV scale\ncharge 2/3 fermionic top partners ($T'$) which decay to $t+Z$. A comparison\nwith the di-leptonic channel reveals that signals with missing energy offer\nsuperior probes of new physics at TeV scales, despite the large $t\\bar{t}$\nbackgrounds. The effect can be attributed to a factor of $\\sim 3$ enhancement\nin the signal cross section, coming from the branching ratio of $Z\\rightarrow\n\\nu \\bar{\\nu}$.

This paper will give an overview of the accelerator-based\nshort-baseline neutrino oscillation program with a focus on the MicroBooNE\nexperiment while highlighting the prospects for further addressing the\nshort-baseline anomalies in the near future. \n\n"}

Such unfolded histograms are then compared to theoretical\npredictions, either to judge the goodness of fit of a theory, or to compare the\nabilities of two or more theories to describe the data. When doing this, even\ninformally, one is testing hypotheses. However, a more fundamentally sound way\nto test hypotheses is to smear the theoretical predictions by simulating\ndetector response and then comparing to the data without unfolding; this is\nalso frequently done in high energy physics, particularly in searches for new\nphysics. One can thus ask: to what extent does hypothesis testing after\nunfolding data materially reproduce the results obtained from testing by\nsmearing theoretical predictions? We argue that this \"bottom-line-test\" of\nunfolding methods should be studied more commonly, in addition to common\npractices of examining variance and bias of estimates of the true contents of\nhistogram bins.

In this work we will show that neutrino oscillation\nexperiments can improve this limit by several orders of magnitude and therefore\nare an ideal tool to explore the foundations of our approach to Nature.\n  Strictly speaking testing CPT violation would require an explicit model for\nhow CPT is broken and its effects on physics. Instead, what is presented in\nthis paper is a test of one of the predictions of CPT conservation, i.e., the\nsame mass and mixing parameters in neutrinos and antineutrinos. In order to do\nthat we calculate the current CPT bound on all the neutrino mixing parameters\nand study the sensitivity of the DUNE experiment to such an observable.\n  After deriving the most updated bound on CPT from neutrino oscillation data,\nwe show that, if the recent T2K results turn out to be the true values of\nneutrino and antineutrino oscillations, DUNE would measure the fallout of CPT\nconservation at more than 3$\\sigma$.

A superfluid helium target has\nseveral advantageous properties, including a light nuclear mass for better\nkinematic matching with light dark matter particles, copious production of\nscintillation light, extremely good intrinsic radiopurity, a high impedance to\nexternal vibration noise, and a unique mechanism for observing phonon-like\nmodes via liberation of $^4$He atoms into a vacuum (`quantum evaporation'). In\nthis concept, both scintillation photons and triplet excimers are detected\nusing calorimeters, including calorimeters immersed in the superfluid.

First, we advocate that the two nonets form the flavor nonet\napproximately satisfying the Gell-Mann--Okubo mass relation.

The marginal mass ordering however can be regarded as\nanother signature for tetraquarks because it can be explained partially by the\nhyperfine masses calculated from the tetraquark mixing framework. The\ntetraquark mixing parameters are found to be independent of isospins giving\nadditional support for the formation of the flavor nonets.

The maximum-likelihood method is the standard approach to obtain model\nfits to observational data and the corresponding confidence regions. We\ninvestigate possible sources of bias in the log-likelihood function and its\nsubsequent analysis, focusing on estimators of the inverse covariance matrix.\nFurthermore, we study under which circumstances the estimated covariance matrix\nis invertible. METHODS. We perform Monte-Carlo simulations to investigate the\nbehaviour of estimators for the inverse covariance matrix, depending on the\nnumber of independent data sets and the number of variables of the data\nvectors. RESULTS. We find that the inverse of the maximum-likelihood estimator\nof the covariance is biased, the amount of bias depending on the ratio of the\nnumber of bins (data vector variables), P, to the number of data sets, N. This\nbias inevitably leads to an -- in extreme cases catastrophic -- underestimation\nof the size of confidence regions. We report on a method to remove this bias\nfor the idealised case of Gaussian noise and statistically independent data\nvectors. Moreover, we demonstrate that marginalisation over parameters\nintroduces a bias into the marginalised log-likelihood function.

A large mass hierarchy can be achieved while\nmaintaining the normal sparticle spectra if there is a direction in which the\ntree level potential becomes flat when a particular Yukawa coupling vanishes.\nWe describe the conditions needed for the desired breaking pattern, to avoid\nunwanted global symmetries, and for an acceptable effective mu parameter.

In addition a\npossibility of $B^-$-nuclear bound (atomic) states is briefly discussed. \n\n"}

The convolution of perturbative QCD\nparton-nucleon cross sections predicts naturally the competing pattern of\nlow-pT suppression due geometrical shadowing, and a moderate-pT Cronin\nenhancement of hadron spectra. The formal equivalence to recent classical\nYang-Mills calculations is demonstrated, but our approach is shown to be more\ngeneral in the large x>0.01 domain because it automatically incorporates the\nfinite kinematic constraints of both quark and gluon processes in the\nfragmentation regions, and accounts for the observed spectra in elementary\npp-->\\pi+X processes in the RHIC energy range, sqrt{s} = 20-200 GeV. The\nGlauber-Eikonal formalism can be used as a baseline to extract the magnitude of\ndynamical shadowing effects from the experimental data at differente\ncentralities and pseudo-rapidities. \n\n"}
{"id": "nucl-th/0311089", "contents": "Title: Dispersion Relation Constrained Partial Wave Analysis of piN Elastic and\n  piN\\to\\etaN Scattering Data: The Baryon Spectrum Abstract: We present results from a comprehensive partial-wave analysis of pi+-p\nelastic scattering and charge-exchange data, covering the region from threshold\nto 2.1 GeV in the lab pion kinetic energy, employing a coupled-channel\nformalism to simultaneously fit pi-p\\to\\eta n data to 0.8 GeV. Our main result,\nsolution FA02, utilizes a complete set of forward and fixed-t dispersion\nrelation constraints, from threshold to 1 GeV, and from t = 0 to -0.4\n(GeV/c)^2, applied to the piN elastic amplitude. A large number of systematic\nchecks have been performed, including fits with no charge-exchange data and\nother database changes, fits with few or no dispersion relation constraints,\nand changes to the Coulomb correction scheme. We have also reexamined methods\nused to extract Breit-Wigner resonance parameters. The quality of fit to both\ndata and dispersion relation constraints is superior to our earlier work. The\nresults of these analyses are compared with previous solutions in terms of\ntheir resonance spectra and preferred values for couplings and low-energy\nparameters, including the piNN coupling constant. \n\n"}

Two\ntheoretical approaches are compared and contrasted: the pQCD-based\nGlauber-Eikonal model and Colour Glass Condensate models.
