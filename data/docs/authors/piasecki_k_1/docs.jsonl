The diffusion process is\nsimulated using relativistic Fokker-Planck dynamics for elastic scattering in a\nhydrodynamic background. The heavy-quark transport coefficients in the medium\nare obtained from non-perturbative $T$-matrix interactions which build up\nresonant correlations close to the transition temperature. The latter also form\nthe basis for hadronization of heavy quarks into heavy-flavor mesons via\nrecombination with light quarks from the medium. The pertinent resonance\nrecombination satisfies energy conservation and provides an equilibrium mapping\nbetween quark and meson distributions. The recombination probability is derived\nfrom the resonant heavy-quark scattering rate. Consequently, recombination\ndominates at low transverse momentum ($p_T$) and yields to fragmentation at\nhigh $p_T$. Our approach thus emphasizes the role of resonance correlations in\nthe diffusion and hadronization processes. We calculate the nuclear\nmodification factor and elliptic flow of $D$- and $B$-mesons for Au-Au\ncollisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, and compare their\ndecay-electron spectra to available data.

The former feature leads to an extremely\nintensive gluon radiation and energy dissipation at the early stage of\nhadronization, either in vacuum or in a medium. As a result, a leading hadron\nmust be produced on a short length scale. Evaluation within a model of\nperturbative fragmentation confirms the shortness of the production length.\nThis result is at variance with the unjustified assumption of long production\nlength, made within the popular energy loss scenario. Thus we conclude that the\nmain reason of suppression of high-pT hadrons in heavy ion collisions is the\ncontrolled by color transparency attenuation of a high-pT dipole propagating\nthrough the hot medium. Adjusting a single parameter, the transport\ncoefficient, we describe quite well the data from LHC and RHIC for the\nsuppression factor R_{AA} as function of pT, collision energy and centrality.\nWe observe that the complementary effect of initial state interaction causes a\nflattening and even fall of R_{AA} at large pT.

The first property is the approximate scaling\nrelation between proton and neutron high-momentum distributions weighted by\ntheir relative fractions in the nucleus.

When explicit Z(3) symmetry breaking effects (arising from\ndynamical quark effects) are small, then we find well defined Z(3) domains\nwhich coarsen in time.

The recommended rate and its associated uncertainties are also\nincluded. Currently, uncertainties are absent from all other rate libraries,\nand, although estimates have been attempted in previous evaluations and\ncompilations, these are generally not based on rigorous statistical\ndefinitions.

Because a majority of rates are\nlognormally distributed, this allows the construction of rate probability\ndensities from the columns of STARLIB. This structure is based on a recently\nsuggested Monte Carlo method to calculate reaction rates, where uncertainties\nare rigorously defined.

Momentum degradation of the hard and semihard partons as they traverse\nthe inhomogeneous medium at various azimuthal angles results in a complicated\nconvolution of geometrical, nuclear and dynamical factors that cannot usually\nbe described in a transparent way. In this work a compact formula is found that\nrepresents the inclusive distributions of minijets of any parton type at the\nsurface of the medium for any collision centrality. They take into account the\ncontributions from all initiating partons created at any point in the medium.\nBy comparing with the case of no energy loss, a ratio has been determined that\nis analogous to the nuclear modification factor for minijets. Phenomenological\nreality of such distributions is examined by calculating the hadronization of\nthe minijets in the recombination model.

Systematic calculations with the ImQMD model show that the\nfluctuation-dissipation relation found in the symmetric head-on fusion\nreactions at energies just above the Coulomb barrier fades out when the\nincident energy increases. It turns out that this dynamical change with\nincreasing incident energy is caused by a specific behavior of the friction\nparameter which directly depends on the microscopic dynamical process, i.e., on\nhow the collective energy of the relative motion is transferred into the\nintrinsic excitation energy. It is shown microscopically that the energy\ndissipation in the fusion process is governed by two mechanisms: One is caused\nby the nucleon exchanges between two fusing nuclei, and the other is due to a\nrearrangement of nucleons in the intrinsic system. The former mechanism\nmonotonically increases the dissipative energy and shows a weak dependence on\nthe incident energy, while the latter depends on both the relative distance\nbetween two fusing nuclei and the incident energy.

Several coating/reflector combinations were produced\nusing VM2000, a specular reflecting multi layer polymer, and Tetratex, a\ndiffuse reflecting PTFE fabric, as reflector foils.

Di-hadron fragmentation functions can be extracted from\nsemi-inclusive electron-positron annihilation data. They also appear in\nobservables describing the semi-inclusive production of two hadrons in\ndeep-inelastic scattering of leptons off nucleons or in hadron-hadron\ncollisions. When a target nucleon is transversely polarized, a specific\nchiral-odd di-hadron fragmentation function can be used as the analyzer of the\nnet density of transversely polarized quarks in a transversely polarized\nnucleon, the so-called transversity distribution. The latter can be extracted\nthrough suitable single-spin asymmetries in the framework of collinear\nfactorization, thus in a much simpler framework with respect to the traditional\none in single-hadron fragmentation. At subleading twist, the same chiral-odd\ndi-hadron fragmentation function provides the cleanest access to the poorly\nknown twist-3 parton distribution $e(x)$, which is intimately related to the\nmechanism of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in QCD. When sensitive to\ndetails of transverse momentum dynamics of partons, the di-hadron fragmentation\nfunctions for a longitudinally polarized quark can be connected to the\nlongitudinal jet handedness to explore possible effects due to $CP-$violation\nof the QCD vacuum. In this review, we outline the formalism of di-hadron\nfragmentation functions, we discuss different observables where they appear and\nwe present measurements and future worldwide plans. \n\n"}

Among them is the Chiral\nMagnetic Effect (CME) -- the generation of electric current along an external\nmagnetic field induced by chirality imbalance.

{"id": "1608.00487", "contents": "Title: Analysis of Neutron Stars Observations Using a Correlated Fermi Gas\n  Model Abstract: Background: The nuclear symmetry energy is a fundamental ingredient in\ndetermining the equation of state (EOS) of neutron stars (NS). Recent\nterrestrial experiments constrain both its value and slope at nuclear\nsaturation density, however, its value at higher densities is unknown. Assuming\na Free Fermi-gas (FFG) model for the kinetic symmetry energy, the high-density\nextrapolation depends on a single parameter, the density dependence of the\npotential symmetry energy. The Correlated Fermi-gas (CFG) model improves on the\nFFG model by including the effects of short-range, correlated, high-momentum,\nnucleons in nuclear matter. Using the CFG model for the kinetic symmetry energy\nalong with constraints from terrestrial measurements leads to a much softer\ndensity dependence for the potential symmetry energy. Purpose: Examine the\nability of the FFG and CFG models to describe NS observables that are directly\nsensitive to the symmetry energy at high-density. Specifically, examine the\nability of the CFG model, with its softer density dependence of the potential\nsymmetry energy, to describe a two solar-mass NS. Methods: Using a Bayesian\nanalysis of NS observables we compare the CFG and FFG models and examine the\nresulting parameters in the NS EOS and the density dependence of the potential\nsymmetry energy. Results: Despite the large difference in the density\ndependence of the potential part of the symmetry energy, both models can\ndescribe the NS data and support a two solar-mass NS. The different density\ndependences has only a small effect on the NS EOS. Conclusions: While sensitive\nto the high-density values of the symmetry energy, NS observables alone are not\nenough to distinguish between the CFG and FFG models. This indicates that the\nNS EOS, obtain from Bayesian analysis of NS observables, is robust and is not\nsensitive to the exact nuclear model used for the kinetic symmetry energy. \n\n"}

The asymmetry due to the unequal number of\nparticipating nucleons, referred to as longitudinal asymmetry, causes a shift\nin the center of mass rapidity of the participant zone. The information of the\nevent asymmetry allows us to isolate and study the effect of longitudinal\nasymmetry on rapidity distribution of final state particles. In a Monte Carlo\nGlauber model the average rapidity-shift is found to be almost linearly related\nto the asymmetry. Using toy models, as well as Monte Carlo data for Pb-Pb\ncollisions at 2.76 TeV generated with HIJING, two different versions of AMPT\nand DPMJET models, we demonstrate that the effect of asymmetry on final state\nrapidity distribution can be quantitatively related to the average rapidity\nshift via a third-order polynomial with a dominantly linear term. The\ncoefficients of the polynomial are proportional to the rapidity shift with the\ndependence being sensitive to the details of the rapidity\ndistribution.Experimental estimates of the spectator asymmetry through the\nmeasurement of spectator nucleons in a Zero Degree Calorimeter may hence be\nused to further constrain the initial conditions in ultra-relativistic\nheavy-ion collisions. \n\n"}

This can lead to observable charge separation along the\ndirection of the strong magnetic field produced by spectator protons in\nrelativistic heavy-ion collisions, a phenomenon called the chiral magnetic\neffect (CME). A major background source for CME measurements using the\ncharge-dependent azimuthal correlator ($\\Delta\\gamma$) is the intrinsic\nparticle correlations (such as resonance decays) coupled with the azimuthal\nelliptical anisotropy ($v_{2}$). In heavy-ion collisions, the magnetic field\ndirection and event plane angle are correlated, thus the CME and the\n$v_{2}$-induced background are entangled. In this report, we present two\nstudies from STAR to shed further lights on the background issue. (1) The\n$\\Delta\\gamma$ should be all background in small system p+Au and d+Au\ncollisions, because the event plane angles are dominated by geometry\nfluctuations uncorrelated to the magnetic field direction. However, significant\n$\\Delta\\gamma$ is observed, comparable to the peripheral Au+Au data, suggesting\na background dominance in the latter, and likely also in the mid-central Au+Au\ncollisions where the multiplicity and $v_{2}$ scaled correlator is similar.

Signal is consistent with zero within\nuncertainties at high $m_{inv}$. Signal at low $m_{inv}$, extracted from a\ntwo-component model assuming smooth mass dependence, is consistent with zero\nwithin uncertainties. \n\n"}

The CF\nis constrained by centrality selection based on particle multiplicity in a\nreference subevent, and contributes to observables measured in another\nsubevent. Using a Glauber-based independent source model, we study the\ninfluence of CF on several distributions of multiplicity $N$ and eccentricities\n$\\epsilon_n$: $p(N)$, $p(\\epsilon_n)$, $p(\\epsilon_n,\\epsilon_m)$ and\n$p(N,\\epsilon_n)$, where the effects of CF is quantified using multi-particle\ncumulants of these distributions. In mid-central collisions, a general relation\nis established between the multiplicity fluctuation and resulting CF in the\nreference subevent. In ultra-central collisions, where distribution of particle\nproduction sources is strongly distorted, we find these cumulants exhibit rich\nsign-change patterns, due to observable-dependent non-Gaussianity in the\nunderlying distributions. The details of sign-change pattern change with the\nsize of the collision systems. Simultaneous comparison of these different types\ncumulants between model prediction and experimental data can be used to\nconstrain the CF and particle production mechanism in heavy-ion collisions.\nSince the concept of centrality and CF are expected to fluctuate in the\nlongitudinal direction within a single event, we propose to use\npseudorapidity-separated subevent cumulant method to explore the nature of\nintra-event fluctuations of centrality and collective dynamics.

Jet deflection towards large angles due to scattering off of\nquasi-particles in the Quark-Gluon Plasma may also occur, which can be studied\nthrough a measurement of the hadron-jet acoplanarity.
