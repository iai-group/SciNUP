Here we\nconsider this notion in the context of three formalisms used for different\npurposes in reasoning about multi-agent systems: strategic games, CP-nets, and\nsoft constraints. To relate the notions of optimality in these formalisms we\nintroduce a natural qualitative modification of the notion of a strategic game.\nWe show then that the optimal outcomes of a CP-net are exactly the Nash\nequilibria of such games. This allows us to use the techniques of game theory\nto search for optimal outcomes of CP-nets and vice-versa, to use techniques\ndeveloped for CP-nets to search for Nash equilibria of the considered games.\nThen, we relate the notion of optimality used in the area of soft constraints\nto that used in a generalization of strategic games, called graphical games. In\nparticular we prove that for a natural class of soft constraints that includes\nweighted constraints every optimal solution is both a Nash equilibrium and\nPareto efficient joint strategy. For a natural mapping in the other direction\nwe show that Pareto efficient joint strategies coincide with the optimal\nsolutions of soft constraints. \n\n"}

Within this framework, we demonstrate that the qubit can function as a\nquantum switch between the two resonators, which are assumed to be originally\nindependent. In this three-circuit network, the qubit mediates a geometric\nsecond-order circuit interaction between the otherwise decoupled resonators. In\nthe dispersive regime, it also gives rise to a dynamic second-order\nperturbative interaction. The geometric and dynamic coupling strengths can be\ntuned to be equal, thus permitting to switch on and off the interaction between\nthe two resonators via a qubit population inversion or a shifting of the qubit\noperation point. We also show that our quantum switch represents a flexible\narchitecture for the manipulation and generation of nonclassical microwave\nfield states as well as the creation of controlled multipartite entanglement in\ncircuit QED. In addition, we clarify the role played by the geometric\ninteraction, which constitutes a fundamental property characteristic of\nsuperconducting quantum circuits without counterpart in quantum-optical\nsystems. We develop a detailed theory of the geometric second-order coupling by\nmeans of circuit transformations for superconducting charge and flux qubits.\nFurthermore, we show the robustness of the quantum switch operation with\nrespect to decoherence mechanisms. Finally, we propose a realistic design for a\ntwo-resonator circuit QED setup based on a flux qubit and estimate all the\nrelated parameters. In this manner, we show that this setup can be used to\nimplement a superconducting quantum switch with available technology. \n\n"}

This planet, named\nBeta Pic b, is observed at a projected distance of 8AU from the central star.\nIt is therefore a plausible candidate for the photometric event observed in\n1981. The coincidence of the observed position of the planet in November 2003\nand the calculated position assuming that the 1981 transit is due to a planet\norbiting at 8 AU is intriguing.

Although the available\nmass for accretion increases with radial distance (a) for disk solid surface\ndensity (sigma) functions sigma=sigma_0*a^(-alpha) with alpha < 2, the\naccretion timescale is significantly longer at larger radial distances.\nEfficient accretion is limited to the first ~ 1E5 years of planetary evolution,\nwhen the planet is extended and before gap opening and type II migration take\nplace. The accreted mass is calculated for disk masses of 0.01, 0.05 and 0.1\nM_sun with alpha = 1/2, 1, and 3/2. We show that a Jupiter-mass protoplanet can\naccrete 1 to 110 M_earth of heavy elements, depending on the disk properties.\nOur results explain the large variation in heavy element enrichment found in\nextra-solar giant planets. Since higher disk surface density is found to lead\nto larger heavy element enrichment, our model results are consistent with the\ncorrelation between heavy element enrichment and stellar metallicity. Our\ncalculations also suggest that Jupiter could have formed at a larger radial\ndistance than its current location while still accreting the mass of heavy\nelements predicted by interior models.

The theoretical results are used to develop models of\nbinary or multiple system formation from RPPs, and explain the observation that\na greater fraction of binaries originated farther from the Sun. At the stage of\nRPPs, small-body satellites can form in two ways: a merger between RPPs can\nhave two centers of contraction, or the formation of satellites from a disc\naround the primary or the secondary. Formation of the disc can be caused by\nthat the angular momentum of the RPP formed by the merger is greater than the\ncritical angular momentum for a solid body. One or several satellites of the\nprimary (moving mainly in low-eccentricity orbits) can be formed from this disc\nat any separation less than the Hill radius. The first scenario can explain a\nsystem such as 2001 QW322 where the two components have similar masses but are\nseparated by a great distance. In general, any values for the eccentricity and\ninclination of the mutual orbit are possible.

It is also, by a wide margin, the highest mass system with\n>27 Jupiters of planetary mass past 25 AU. This is a remarkable system with no\nanalogue with any other known planetary system. In the first part of this paper\nwe investigate the nature of two faint objects imaged near the system.

It is possible that these two objects could\nbe lower mass planets (of mass ~5 and ~3 Jupiters) that have been scattered to\nwider orbits. We make the first direct comparison of newly reduced archival\nGemini adaptive optics images to archival HST/NICMOS images. With nearly a\ndecade between these epochs we can accurately assess the proper motion nature\nof each candidate companion. We find that both objects are unbound to HR 8799\nand are background.

It has been suggested that the dynamics of multi\nagent learning can be studied using replicator equations from population\nbiology. Most existing studies so far have been limited to discrete strategy\nspaces with a small number of available actions. In many cases, however, the\nchoices available to agents are better characterized by continuous spectra.\nThis paper suggests a generalization of the replicator framework that allows to\nstudy the adaptive dynamics of Q-learning agents with continuous strategy\nspaces. Instead of probability vectors, agents strategies are now characterized\nby probability measures over continuous variables. As a result, the ordinary\ndifferential equations for the discrete case are replaced by a system of\ncoupled integral--differential replicator equations that describe the mutual\nevolution of individual agent strategies. We derive a set of functional\nequations describing the steady state of the replicator dynamics, examine their\nsolutions for several two-player games, and confirm our analytical results\nusing simulations. \n\n"}

In a series\nof papers, we investigate the deep links between 2D self-consistent disc\nstructure and planetary migration in irradiated discs, focusing particularly on\nthose around M stars. In this first paper, we analyse the thermal structure of\ndiscs that are irradiated by an M star by solving the radiative transfer\nequation by means of a Monte Carlo code. Our simulations of irradiated\nhydrostatic discs are realistic and self-consistent in that they include dust\nsettling with multiple grain sizes (N=15), the gravitational force of an\nembedded planet on the disc, and the presence of a dead zone (a region with\nvery low levels of turbulence) within it. We show that dust settling drives the\ntemperature of the mid-plane from an $r^{-3/5}$ distribution (well mixed dust\nmodels) toward an $r^{-3/4}$. The dead zone, meanwhile, leaves a dusty wall at\nits outer edge because dust settling in this region is enhanced compared to the\nactive turbulent disc at larger disc radii. The disc heating produced by this\nirradiated wall provides a positive gradient region of the temperature in the\ndead zone in front of the wall. This is crucially important for slowing\nplanetary migration because Lindblad torques are inversely proportional to the\ndisc temperature. Furthermore, we show that low turbulence of the dead zone is\nself-consistently induced by dust settling, resulting in the Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability (KHI). We show that the strength of turbulence arising from the KHI\nin the dead zone is $\\alpha=10^{-5}$. \n\n"}

The eccentricity of the outer\nplanet (ec) is estimated to be 0.11(+0.17,-0.04), comparable to that of Saturn\n(0.01-0.09).

In this paper we use the different metallicity\ndependance of X-ray photoevaporation and planet formation to discriminate\nbetween these two processes. We study the effects of metallicity, Z, on the\ndispersal timescale, t_phot, in the context of a photoevaporation model, by\nmeans of detailed thermal calculations of a disc in hydrostatic equilibrium\nirradiated by EUV and X-ray radiation from the central source. Our models show\nt_phot \\propto Z^0.52 for a pure photoevaporation model. By means of analytical\nestimates we derive instead a much stronger negative power dependance on\nmetallicity of the disc lifetime for a dispersal model based on planet\nformation. A census of disc fractions in lower metallicity regions should\ntherefore be able to distinguish between the two models. A recent study by\nYasui et al. in low metallicity clusters of the extreme outer Galaxy ([O/H] ~-\n0.7dex and dust to gas ratio of ~0.001) provides preliminary observational\nevidence for shorter disc lifetimes at lower metallicities, in agreement with\nthe predictions of a pure photoevaporation model.

It is designed to be efficient enough to handle microlensing\nevents with more than two lens masses and lens orbital motion. This method uses\na polar coordinate integration grid with a smaller grid spacing in the radial\ndirection than in the angular direction, and it employs an integration scheme\nspecifically designed to handle limb darkened sources. I present tests that\nshow that these features achieve second order accuracy for the light curves of\na number of high-magnification planetary events. They improve the precision of\nthe calculations by a factor of >100 compared to first order integration\nschemes with the same grid spacing in both directions (for a fixed number of\ngrid points).

In this paper we put forward\na fundamentally different approach that links such large-scale magnetic fields\nto the cosmological vacuum energy. In our scenario the dark energy is due to\nthe Veneziano ghost (which solves the $U(1)_A$ problem in QCD). The Veneziano\nghost couples through the triangle anomaly to the electromagnetic field with a\nconstant which is unambiguously fixed in the standard model. While this\ninteraction does not produce any physical effects in Minkowski space, it\ntriggers the generation of a magnetic field in an expanding universe at every\nepoch.

We estimate the mass accretion rate and\ngrowth timescale of gas giant planets. The mass accretion rate increases with\nprotoplanet mass for M_p < M_cri, while it becomes saturated or decreases for\nM_p > M_cri, where M_cri = 0.036 M_Jup (a_p/1AU)^0.75, and M_Jup and a_p are\nthe Jovian mass and the orbital radius, respectively. The growth timescale of a\ngas giant planet or the timescale of the gas accretion onto the protoplanet is\nabout 10^5 yr, that is two orders of magnitude shorter than the growth\ntimescale of the solid core. The thermal effects barely affect the mass\naccretion rate because the gravitational energy dominates the thermal energy\naround the protoplanet. The mass accretion rate obtained in our local\nsimulations agrees quantitatively well with those obtained in global\nsimulations with coarser spatial resolution.

The particularly interesting property of Neptune-sized planets\nis that their mass Mp and radius Rp are close to theoretical M-R relations of\nwater planets. Given Mp, Rp, and equilibrium temperature, however, various\ninternal compositions are possible. A broad set of interior structure models is\npresented here that illustrates the dependence of internal composition and\npossible phases of water occurring in presumably water-rich planets, such as GJ\n436b on the uncertainty in atmospheric temperature profile and mean density. We\nshow how the set of solutions can be narrowed down if theoretical constraints\nfrom formation and model atmospheres are applied or potentially observational\nconstraints for the atmospheric metallicity Z1 and the tidal Love number k2. We\nmodel the interior by assuming either three layers (hydrogen-helium envelope,\nwater layer, rock core) or two layers (H/He/H2O envelope, rocky core). For\nwater, we use the equation of state H2O-REOS based on FT-DFT-MD simulations.\nSome admixture of H/He appears mandatory for explaining the measured radius.\nFor the warmest considered models, the H/He mass fraction can reduce to 10^-3,\nstill extending over ~0.7 REarth. If water occurs, it will be essentially in\nthe plasma phase or in the superionic phase, but not in an ice phase.\nMetal-free envelope models have 0.02<k2<0.2, and the core mass cannot be\ndetermined from a measurement of k2. In contrast, models with 0.3<k2<0.82\nrequire high metallicities Z1<0.89 in the outer envelope. The uncertainty in\ncore mass decreases to 0.4 Mp, if k2>0.3, and further to 0.2 Mp, if k2>0.5, and\ncore mass and Z1 become sensitive functions of k2. To further narrow the set of\nsolutions, a proper treatment of the atmosphere and the evolution is necessary. \n\n"}

Spectra of 147 sources are presented and classified.\nBackground stars (with slope consistent with a reddened stellar spectrum and\nsilicate features in absorption), galaxies (with redshifted PAH features) and a\nplanetary nebula (with high ionization lines) amount to 22% of contamination in\nthis sample, leaving 115 true YSOs.

So\nfar, UV transit observations have led to the detection of atomic hydrogen,\noxygen and ionized carbon in the upper atmosphere of HD209458b. The\ninterpretation of these observations is controversial - it is not clear if the\nabsorption arises from an escaping atmosphere interacting with the stellar\nradiation and stellar wind, or the thermosphere inside the Roche lobe. Here we\nintroduce an empirical model that can be used to analyze UV transit depths of\nextrasolar planets and use it to interpret the transits of HD209458b in the H\nLy alpha and the OI triplet emission lines. The results indicate that the mean\ntemperature of the thermosphere is 8,000-11,000 K and that the H2/H\ndissociation front is located at pressures between 0.1-1 microbar, which\ncorrespond to an altitude of 1.1 Rp. The upper boundary of the model\nthermosphere is located at altitudes between 2.7-3 Rp, above which the\natmosphere is mostly ionized.

By assuming a solar mixing ratio\nof oxygen, we obtain an OI transit depth that is statistically consistent with\nthe observations. An OI transit depth comparable to or slightly larger than the\nHI transit depth is possible if the atmosphere is undergoing fast hydrodynamic\nescape, the O/H ratio is supersolar, or if a significant quantity of neutral\noxygen is found outside the Roche lobe.

We show\nthat common estimates of the disk's spreading time-scales with constant\nviscosity significantly underestimate the rings' lifetime. With a realistic\nviscosity model, an initially narrow ring undergoes two successive evolutionary\nstages: (1) a transient rapid spreading when the disk is self-gravitating, with\nthe formation of a density peak inward and an outer region marginally\ngravitationally stable, and with an emptying time-scale proportional to 1/M_0^2\n(where M_0 is the disk's initial mass) (2) an asymptotic regime where the\nspreading rate continuously slows down as larger parts of the disk become\nnot-self-gravitating due to the decrease of the surface density, until the disk\nbecomes completely not-self-gravitating.

We postulate that any such\nprobability measure can be assigned a corresponding conjugate utility function\nbased on three axioms: utilities should be real-valued, additive and monotonic\nmappings of probabilities. We show that these axioms enforce a unique\nconversion law between utility and probability (and thereby, information).\nMoreover, we show that this relation can be characterized as a variational\nprinciple: given a utility function, its conjugate probability measure\nmaximizes a free utility functional. Transformations of probability measures\ncan then be formalized as a change in free utility due to the addition of new\nconstraints expressed by a target utility function. Accordingly, one obtains a\ncriterion to choose a probability measure that trades off the maximization of a\ntarget utility function and the cost of the deviation from a reference\ndistribution. We show that optimal control, adaptive estimation and adaptive\ncontrol problems can be solved this way in a resource-efficient way. When\nresource costs are ignored, the MEU principle is recovered.

We show that the magnetic field lines\npresent an oscillatory pattern and that by increasing the misalignment angle,\nthe wind velocity increases. Our wind models allow us to study the interaction\nof a magnetized wind with a magnetized extra-solar planet. Such interaction\ngives rise to reconnection, generating electrons that propagate along the\nplanet's magnetic field lines and produce electron cyclotron radiation at radio\nwavelengths. We find that a close-in Jupiter-like planet orbiting at 0.05AU\npresents a radio power that is ~5 orders of magnitude larger than the one\nobserved in Jupiter, which suggests that the stellar wind from a young star has\nthe potential to generate strong planetary radio emission that could be\ndetected in the near future with LOFAR. This radio power varies according to\nthe phase of rotation of the star. We also analyze whether winds from\nmisaligned stellar magnetospheres could cause a significant effect on planetary\nmigration. Compared to the aligned case, we show that the time-scale tau_w for\nan appreciable radial motion of the planet is shorter for larger misalignment\nangles. While for the aligned case tau_w~100Myr, for a stellar magnetosphere\ntilted by 30deg, tau_w ranges from ~40 to 70Myr for a planet located at a\nradius of 0.05AU. (Abridged) \n\n"}

Previous measurements at 3.6 microns suffered from\nstrong systematics and conclusions could hardly be obtained with confidence on\nthe water detection by comparison of the 3.6 and 5.8 microns observations. We\nuse a high S/N Spitzer photometric transit light curve to improve the precision\nof the near infrared radius of the planet at 3.6 microns.

These measurements are three\ntimes more accurate than previous studies at this wavelength because they\nbenefit from greater observational efficiency and less statistic and systematic\nerrors. Nonetheless, we find that the radius ratio has to be corrected for\nstellar activity and present a method to do so using ground-based long-duration\nphotometric follow-up in the V-band. The resulting planet-to-star radius ratio\ncorrected for the stellar variability is in agreement with the previous\nmeasurement obtained in the same bandpass (Desert et al. 2009).

Among other\nscenarios considered, it has been proposed that eccentricity may grow through\nplanet-disc interaction. Recently, it has been noticed that the thermodynamical\nstate of the disc can significantly influence the migration properties of\ngrowing protoplanets. However, the evolution of planetary eccentricity in\nradiative discs has not been considered yet. In this paper we study the\nevolution of planets on eccentric orbits that are embedded in a\nthree-dimensional viscous disc and analyse the disc's effect on the orbital\nevolution of the planet. We use the three-dimensional hydrodynamical code\nNIRVANA that includes full tensor viscosity and implicit radiation transport in\nthe flux-limited diffusion approximation. The code uses the FARGO-algorithm to\nspeed up the simulations. First we measure the torque and power exerted on the\nplanet by the disc for fixed orbits, and then we let the planet start with\ninitial eccentricity and evolve it in the disc. For locally isothermal we\nconfirm previous results and find eccentricity damping and inward migration for\nplanetary cores. In the case of radiative discs, the planets experience an\ninward migration as long as its eccentricity lies above a certain threshold.\nAfter the damping of eccentricity cores with masses below 33 Earthmasses begin\nto migrate outward in radiative discs, while higher mass cores always migrate\ninward. For all planetary masses studied (up to 200 Earthmasses) we find\neccentricity damping. In viscous discs the orbital eccentricity of embedded\nplanets is damped during the evolution independent of the mass. Hence,\nplanet-disc interaction does not seem to be a viable mechanism to explain the\nobserved high eccentricity of exoplanets. \n\n"}

We discuss dynamical scenarios\nthat can explain the large motions of both BN and Source I and the presence of\ndisks around both. Our new measurements support the hypothesis that a close\n(~50 AU) dynamical interaction occurred around 500 years ago between Source I\nand BN as proposed by Gomez et al.

In this paper, the first in a series, we present and test a novel\nnumerical implementation of stellar feedback resulting from momentum imparted\nto the ISM by radiation, supernovae, and stellar winds. We employ a realistic\ncooling function, and find that a large fraction of the gas cools to <100K, so\nthat the ISM becomes highly inhomogeneous. Despite this, our simulated galaxies\nreach an approximate steady state, in which gas gravitationally collapses to\nform giant molecular clouds (GMCs), dense clumps, and stars; subsequently,\nstellar feedback disperses the GMCs, repopulating the diffuse ISM. This\ncollapse and dispersal cycle is seen in models of SMC-like dwarfs, the\nMilky-Way, and z~2 clumpy disk analogues. The simulated global star formation\nefficiencies are consistent with the observed Kennicutt-Schmidt relation.\nMoreover, the star formation rates are nearly independent of the numerically\nimposed high-density star formation efficiency, density threshold, and density\nscaling. This is a consequence of the fact that, in our simulations, star\nformation is regulated by stellar feedback limiting the amount of very dense\ngas available for forming stars. In contrast, in simulations without stellar\nfeedback, i.e. under the action of only gravity and gravitationally-induced\nturbulence, the ISM experiences runaway collapse to very high densities. In\nthese simulations without feedback, the global star formation rates exceed\nobserved galactic star formation rates by 1-2 orders of magnitude,\ndemonstrating that stellar feedback is crucial to the regulation of star\nformation in galaxies. \n\n"}

Large values of eccentricity and inclination can be excited and\nstrong correlations settle in among the orbital angles. This dynamical\nbehaviour, in particular for bound dust grains, can potentially cause\nsignificant asymmetries in dusty disks around solar type stars which might be\ndetected by observations. However, the amount of orbital changes due to this\nnon--gravitational perturbation is strongly limited by the collisional lifetime\nof dust particles. We show that for large values of the disk's optical depth\nthe influence of ISM flow on the disk shape is almost negligible because the\ngrains are collisionally destroyed before they can accumulate enough orbital\nchanges due to the ISM perturbations. On the other hand, for values smaller\nthan $10^{-3}$, peculiar asymmetric patterns appear in the density profile of\nthe disk when we consider 1-10 mum grains, just above the blow-out threshold.\nThe extent and relevance of these asymmetries grow for lower values of the\noptical depth. An additional sink mechanism, which may prevent the formation of\nlarge clumps and warping in the disks is related to the fast inward migration\ndue to the drag component of the forces. When a significant eccentricity is\npumped up by the ISM perturbations, the drag forces (Poynting-Robertson and in\nparticular ISM drag) drive the disk particles on fast migrating tracks leading\nthem into the star on a short timescale. It is then expected that disks with\nsmall optical depth expand inside the parent body ring all the way towards the\nstar while disks with large optical depth would not significantly extend\ninside. \n\n"}

All the previous studies on the core-accretion\nmodel assumed that the envelope has the solar composition uniformly. In fact,\nthe envelope is likely polluted by evaporated materials of icy planetesimals\nbecause icy planetesimals going through the envelope experience mass loss via\nstrong ablation and most of their masses are deposited in the deep envelope. In\nthis paper, we have demonstrated that envelope pollution in general lowers the\ncritical core masses and hastens gas accretion on to the protoplanet because of\nthe increase in the molecular weight and reduction of adiabatic temperature\ngradient. Widely- and highly-polluted envelopes allow smaller cores to form\nmassive envelopes before disc dissipation.

This\nis consistent with recent theoretical works, which indicate that the tidal Q of\nplanet-hosting stars can indeed be much larger than the values inferred from\nstellar binaries. On the other hand, recent measurements of Rossiter-McLaughlin\neffects in transiting hot Jupiter systems not only reveal that many such\nsystems have misaligned stellar spin with respect to the orbital axis, but also\nshow that systems with cooler host stars tend to have aligned spin and orbital\naxes. Winn et al. suggested that this obliquity - temperature correlation may\nbe explained by efficient damping of stellar obliquity due to tidal dissipation\nin the star. This explanation, however, is in apparent contradiction with the\nsurvival of these short-period hot Jupiters. We show that in the solar-type\nparent stars of close-in exoplanetary systems, the effective tidal Q governing\nthe damping of stellar obliquity can be much smaller than that governing\norbital decay. This is because for misaligned systems, the tidal potential\ncontains a Fourier component with frequency equal to the stellar spin frequency\n(in the rotating frame of the star). This component can excite inertial waves\nin the convective envelope of the star, and the dissipation of inertial waves\nthen leads to a spin-orbit alignment torque, but not orbital decay. By\ncontrast, for aligned systems, such inertial wave excitation is forbidden since\nthe tidal forcing frequency is much larger than the stellar spin frequency.

Highly excited H2O emission in spatially unresolved\nSpitzer/IRS spectra of a low-mass Class 0 object, NGC 1333 IRAS 4B, has\npreviously been attributed to the envelope-disk accretion shock but could\ninstead be produced in an outflow.

The spectrum has high signal-to-noise in a rich forest of H2O, CO, and OH\nlines, providing a near-complete census of far-IR molecular emission from a\nClass 0 protostar. The excitation diagrams for the three molecules all require\nfits with two excitation temperatures, indicating the presence of two physical\ncomponents. The highly excited component of H2O emission is characterized by\nsubthermal excitation of 1500 K gas with a density of 10^5 - 10^7 cm-3,\nconditions that also reproduce the mid-IR H2O emission detected by Spitzer. On\nthe other hand, a high density, low temperature gas can reproduce the H2O\nspectrum observed by Spitzer but underpredicts the H2O lines seen by Herschel.\nNyquist-sampled spectral maps of several lines show two spatial components of\nH2O emission, one centered at 1200 AU south of the central source at the\nposition of the blueshifted outflow lobe and a second centered on-source. Both\nspatial components of the far-IR H2O emission are consistent with emission from\nthe outflow.

We model the disk using a static alpha-disk\nmodel with detailed radiative transfer, parametrizing the shape and size of the\npartially cleared gaps based on the results of hydrodynamic simulations.\nShadowing and illumination by stellar irradiation at the surface of the gap\nleads to increased contrast as the gap trough is deepened by shadowing and\ncooling and the far gap wall is puffed up by illumination and heating. In\ncalculating observables, we find that multiple scattering is important and\nderive an approximation to include these effects. A gap produced by a 200\nM_Earth (70 M_Earth) planet at 10 AU can lower/raise the midplane temperature\nof the disk by up to ~-25/+29% (~-11/+19%) by shadowing in the gap trough and\nillumination on the far shoulder of the gap.

In particular, we consider a\ntemperate climate with polar ice caps (like modern Earth), and a snowball state\nwhere the oceans are globally covered in ice. We first quantitatively study the\nperiodic radiative forcing from, and climatic response to, rotation, obliquity,\nand eccentricity. Orbital eccentricity and seasonal changes in albedo cause\nvariations in the global-mean absorbed flux. The responses of the two climates\nto these global seasons indicate that the temperate planet has 3 times the bulk\nheat capacity of the snowball planet due to the presence of liquid water\noceans. The temperate obliquity seasons are weaker than one would expect based\non thermal inertia alone; this is due to cross-equatorial oceanic and\natmospheric energy transport. Thermal inertia and cross-equatorial heat\ntransport have qualitatively different effects on obliquity seasons, insofar as\nheat transport tends to reduce seasonal amplitude without inducing a phase lag.\nFor an Earth-like planet, however, this effect is masked by the mixing of\nsignals from low thermal inertia regions (sea ice and land) with that from high\nthermal inertia regions (oceans), which also produces a damped response with\nsmall phase lag.

Forty-one of the\nsystems were singly-transiting systems that are now multiply-transiting.\nNotable among the new discoveries are KOI 435 as a new six-candidate system (of\nwhich kind only Kepler-11 was known before), KOI 277 (which includes two\ncandidates in a 6:7 resonance and anti-correlated transit timing variations) -\nall but validating the system, KOIs 719, 1574, and 1871 that have small planet\ncandidates (1.15, 2.05 and 1.71R_Earth) in the habitable zone of their host\nstar, and KOI 1843 that exhibits the shortest period (4.25hr) and among the\nsmallest (0.63 R_Earth) of all planet candidates. We are also able to reject 11\nKOIs as eclipsing binaries, update the ephemeris for five KOIs and otherwise\ndiscuss yet other objects. Interestingly, about 1/3 of the newly detected\ncandidates participate in period commensurabilities. Finally, we discuss the\npossible overestimation of parameter errors in the current list of KOIs.\n  Conclusions. Our results strengthen previous analyses of the multi-transiting\nensemble.

The evidence is\nbased on 14 new measurements of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect (for the systems\nHAT-P-6, HAT-P-7, HAT-P-16, HAT-P-24, HAT-P-32, HAT-P-34, WASP-12, WASP-16,\nWASP-18, WASP-19, WASP-26, WASP-31, Gl 436, and Kepler-8), as well as a\ncritical review of previous observations.

To track these\ninteractions we have conducted a suite of high-resolution (1500^3 effective) 3D\nsimulations that follow the evolution of individual clumps as they move into\nmolecular gas. Even at these high resolutions, our simulations do not quite\nachieve numerical convergence, due to the challenge of properly resolving the\nsmall-scale mixing of ejecta and molecular gas, although they do allow some\nrobust conclusions to be drawn. Isotropically exploding ejecta do not penetrate\ninto the molecular cloud, but, if cooling is properly accounted for, clumpy\nejecta penetrate to distances ~10^18 cm and mix effectively with star-forming\nmolecular gas. The ~2 M_\\odot high-metallicity ejecta from a core-collapse SN\nis likely to mix with ~2 \\times 10^4 M_\\odot of molecular gas. Thus all stars\nforming late (~5 Myr) in the evolution of an HII region may be contaminated by\nSN ejecta at a level ~10^-4. This level of contamination is consistent with the\nabundances of short-lived radionuclides and possibly some stable isotopic\nshifts in the early solar system, and is potentially consistent with the\nobserved variability in stellar elemental abundances.

The planets invoked in that work were\nsignificantly more massive than Jupiter, and moved on orbits that were mutually\ncrossing - an architecture which suggests that mutual encounters and strong\ngravitational interactions are almost guaranteed. In this work, we perform a\nhighly detailed analysis of the proposed HW Vir planetary system. First, we\nconsider the dynamical stability of the system as proposed in the discovery\nwork. Through a mapping process involving 91,125 individual simulations, we\nfind that the system is so unstable that the planets proposed simply cannot\nexist, due to mean lifetimes of less than a thousand years across the whole\nparameter space. We then present a detailed re-analysis of the observational\ndata on HW Vir, deriving a new orbital solution that provides a very good fit\nto the observational data. Our new analysis yields a system with planets more\nwidely spaced, and of lower mass, than that proposed in the discovery work, and\nyields a significantly greater (and more realistic) estimate of the uncertainty\nin the orbit of the outermost body.

This problem may be regarded as a simplified\nmodel of astrophysical tides in convective regions of stars and giant planets.\nThe response can be separated into non-wavelike and wavelike parts, where the\nformer is related instantaneously to the tidal potential and the latter may\ninvolve resonances or other singularities. The imaginary part of the potential\nLove number of the body, which is directly related to the rates of energy and\nangular momentum exchange in the tidal interaction and to the rate of\ndissipation of energy, may have a complicated dependence on the tidal\nfrequency. However, a certain frequency-average of this quantity is independent\nof the dissipative properties of the fluid and can be determined by means of an\nimpulse calculation.

We then compare simulations of binaries with three\ndifferent orbital radii (10, 15, 20 AU). Disks are formed in all three cases,\nhowever the size of the disk and, most importantly, its accretion rate\ndecreases with orbital radii. In addition, the shape of the orbital motions of\nmaterial within the disk becomes increasingly elliptical with increasing binary\nseparation. The flow is mildly unsteady with \"fluttering\" around the bow shock\nobserved. The disks are generally well aligned with the orbital plane after a\nfew binary orbits.

Transit detection\ndepends not only on the planet's radius and orbital period, but also on host\nstar properties. Thus, a sample of stars with transiting planets may not\naccurately represent the target population. Moreover, targets are selected\nusing criteria such as a limiting apparent magnitude. These selection effects,\ncombined with uncertainties in stellar radius, lead to biases in the properties\nof transiting planets and their host stars. We quantify possible biases in the\nKepler survey. First, Eddington bias produced by a steep planet radius\ndistribution and uncertainties in stellar radius results in a 15-20%\noverestimate of planet occurrence. Second, the magnitude limit of the Kepler\ntarget catalog induces Malmquist bias towards large, more luminous stars and\nunderestimation of the radii of about one third of candidate planets,\nespecially those larger than Neptune. Third, because metal-poor stars are\nsmaller, stars with detected planets will be very slightly (<0.02 dex) more\nmetal-poor than the target average. Fourth, uncertainties in stellar radii\nproduce correlated errors in planet radius and stellar irradiation. A previous\nfinding, that highly-irradiated giant are more likely to have \"inflated\" radii,\nremains significant, even accounting for this effect. In contrast, transit\ndepth is negatively correlated with stellar metallicity even in the absence of\nany intrinsic correlation, and a previous claim of a negative correlation\nbetween giant planet transit depth and stellar metallicity is probably an\nartifact. \n\n"}

Dartmouth Stellar Evolution Program models were\ncompared to photometry from the Kepler Input Catalog, priors for stellar mass,\nage, metallicity and distance, and planet transit duration. The analysis\nyielded probability density functions for calculating confidence intervals of\nplanet radius and stellar irradiance, as well as p(HZ). Sixty-two planets have\np(HZ) > 0.5 and a most probable stellar irradiance within habitable zone\nlimits.

It\nhas been seen as improbable that we would find planets in such a small final\nfraction of their lives. The favored solution has been that the tidal\ndissipation is much weaker than expected, which would mean that the final\ninfall would be a larger fraction of the planets' life. We find no reason to\nexclude the explanation that a small number of planets are continuously sent\nmigrating inwards such that these planets indeed are in the last fraction of\ntheir lives. Following the observation that the distribution of medium planets\ndisfavors tidal dissipation being significantly weaker than has been found from\nobservations of binary stars, we now show that the numbers of planets in such a\n\"flow\" of excess planets migrating inwards is low enough that even depletion of\nthe three-day pileup is a plausible source. Then the shortest period occurrence\ndistribution would be shaped by planets continuously being sent into the star,\nwhich may explain the depletion of the pileup in the Kepler field relative to\nthe solar neighborhood (Howard et al. 2012, hereafter H12). Because Kepler\nobserves above the galactic plane, H12 suggested the Kepler field may include\nan older population of stars.

It has been noted that white dwarfs (WDs) have long-lived habitable\nzones and that a large fraction of WDs may host planets. We point out that\nduring a transit of an Earth-mass planet across a WD, the planet's atmospheric\ntransmission spectrum obtains a much higher contrast over the stellar\nbackground compared to a main-sequence host, because of the small surface area\nof the WD. The most prominent bio-marker in the present-day terrestrial\natmosphere, molecular oxygen, is readily detectable in a WD transit via its\nA-band absorption at ~0.76 micron.

The viability of the disk fragmentation scenario for the formation of\nwide-orbit companions in protostellar disks around (sub-)solar mass stars was\ninvestigated. Methods: We used numerical hydrodynamics simulations of disk\nformation and evolution with an accurate treatment of disk thermodynamics. The\nuse of the thin-disk limit allowed us to probe the long-term evolution of\nprotostellar disks. We focused on models that produced wide-orbit GP/BD\nembryos, which opened a gap in the disk and showed radial migration timescales\nsimilar to or longer than the typical disk lifetime. Results: While disk\nfragmentation was seen in the majority of our models, only 6 models out of 60\nrevealed the formation of quasi-stable, wide-orbit GP/BD embryos. Disk\nfragmentation produced GP/BD embryos with masses in the 3.5-43 M_J range,\ncovering the whole mass spectrum of directly-imaged, wide-orbit companions to\n(sub-)solar mass stars.

To reach a high photometric and spectroscopic\nprecision, it is therefore essential to correct for these effects. We present\nhere a novel non-parametric approach, named Gaussian Process method for Star\nCharacterization (GPSC), to remove effects of stellar activity and instrumental\nsystematics on planetary signals, with a view to preserve the atmospheric\ncontribution which can be as small as 10$^{-4}$ or even 10$^{-5}$ the flux of\nthe star. We applied our method to data recorded with Kepler, focussing on a\nsample of lightcurves with different effective temperatures and flux\nmodulations.

The companion Kepler-76b was\nidentified by the BEER algorithm, which detected the BEaming (sometimes called\nDoppler boosting) effect together with the Ellipsoidal and Reflection/emission\nmodulations (BEER), at an orbital period of 1.54 days, suggesting a planetary\ncompanion orbiting the 13.3 mag F star. Further investigation revealed that\nthis star appeared in the Kepler eclipsing binary catalog with estimated\nprimary and secondary eclipse depths of 5e-3 and 1e-4 respectively.\nSpectroscopic radial-velocity follow-up observations with TRES and SOPHIE\nconfirmed Kepler-76b as a transiting 2.0+/-0.26 Mjup hot Jupiter. The mass of a\ntransiting planet can be estimated from either the beaming or the ellipsoidal\namplitude. The ellipsoidal-based mass estimate of Kepler-76b is consistent with\nthe spectroscopically measured mass while the beaming-based estimate is\nsignificantly inflated. We explain this apparent discrepancy as evidence for\nthe superrotation phenomenon, which involves eastward displacement of the\nhottest atmospheric spot of a tidally-locked planet by an equatorial\nsuper-rotating jet stream. This phenomenon was previously observed only for HD\n189733b in the infrared. We show that a phase shift of 10.3+/-2.0 degrees of\nthe planet reflection/emission modulation, due to superrotation, explains the\napparently inflated beaming modulation, resolving the ellipsoidal/beaming\namplitude discrepancy. Kepler-76b is one of very few confirmed planets in the\nKepler light curves that show BEER modulations and the first to show\nsuperrotation evidence in the Kepler band. Its discovery illustrates for the\nfirst time the ability of the BEER algorithm to detect short-period planets and\nbrown dwarfs. \n\n"}

Aims: We intended to find the X-ray coronal counterpart of the\nchromospheric cycle for i Hor. This represents the first X-ray cycle observed\nin an active star, as well as the paradigm of the first coronal cycles in the\nlife of a solar-like star. Methods: We monitored i Hor with XMM-Newton\nobservations spanning almost two years. The spectra of each observation are fit\nwith two-temperature coronal models to study the long-term variability of the\nstar. Results: We find a cyclic behavior in X-rays very similar to the\ncontemporaneous chromospheric cycle. The continuous chromospheric monitoring\nfor more than three cycle lengths shows a trend toward decreasing amplitude,\napparently modulated by a longer term trend. The second cycle is disrupted\nprior to reaching its maximum, followed by a brief episode of chaotic\nvariability before the cyclic behavior resumes, only to be disrupted again\nafter slightly more than one cycle. Conclusions: We confirm the presence of an\nactivity cycle of ~1.6 yr in i Hor both in X-rays and Ca II H&K. It is likely\nsubject to the modulation of a longer, not yet constrained second cycle. The\n1.6 yr cycle is the shortest coronal one observed to date, and i Hor represents\nthe most active star for which a coronal activity cycle has been found.

Two planets which are Hill stable are separated by a wide-enough\ndistance to ensure that they will never collide. However, Hill stable planetary\nsystems may eventually manifest Lagrange instability when the outer planet\nescapes or the inner planet collides with the star. We show empirically that\nfor two nearly coplanar Hill stable planets with eccentricities less than about\n0.3, instability can manifest itself only after a time corresponding to X\ninitial orbits of the inner planet, where log_{10}(X) is of the order of 5.2\nmu^{-0.18} and mu is the planet-star mass ratio measured in (Jupiter mass/Solar\nmass).

Here, we demonstrate\nthat one can unambiguously distinguish between cloudy mini-Neptunes and\nvolatile-dominated worlds based on the differences in the wing steepness and\nrelative depths of water absorption features in moderate-resolution NIR\ntransmission spectra (R~100). In a numerical retrieval study, we show for GJ\n1214b that an unambiguous distinction between a cloudy H2-dominated atmosphere\nand cloud-free H2 atmosphere will be possible if the uncertainties in the\nspectral transit depth measurements can be reduced by a factor of ~3 compared\nto the published HST WFC3 and VLT transit observations.

Due to the drag force, dust trapped in vortices will\naccumulate in the center, and diffusion is needed to maintain a steady state\nover the lifetime of the disk.

We find that the unusual lightcurve shapes of PTFO\n8-8695 can be explained by transits of a planet across an oblate,\ngravity-darkened stellar disk. We simultaneously and self-consistently fit two\nseparate lightcurves observed in 2009 December and 2010 December. Our two\nself-consistent fits yield M_p = 3.0 M_Jup and M_p = 3.6 M_Jup for assumed\nstellar masses of M_* = 0.34 M_Sun and M_* = 0.44 M_Sun respectively. The two\nfits have precession periods of 293 days and 581 days. These mass\ndeterminations (consistent with previous upper limits) along with the strength\nof the gravity-darkened precessing model together validate PTFO 8-8695b as just\nthe second Hot Jupiter known to orbit an M-dwarf. Our fits show a high degree\nof spin-orbit misalignment in the PTFO 8-8695 system: 69 +/- 2 or 73.1 +/- 0.5\ndegrees, in the two cases. The large misalignment is consistent with the\nhypothesis that planets become Hot Jupiters with random orbital plane\nalignments early in a system's lifetime. We predict that as a result of the\nhighly misaligned, precessing system, the transits should disappear for months\nat a time over the course of the system's precession period. The precessing,\ngravity-darkened model also predicts other observable effects: changing orbit\ninclination that could be detected by radial velocity observations, changing\nstellar inclination that would manifest as varying v sin i, changing projected\nspin-orbit alignment that could be seen by the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect,\nchanging transit shapes over the course of the precession, and differing\nlightcurves as a function of wavelength. Our measured planet radii of 1.64\nR_Jup and 1.68 R_Jup in each case are consistent with a young,\nhydrogen-dominated planet that results from a hot-start formation mechanism. \n\n"}

These\nmodels allow us to determine the surface density at which thermal sweeping will\ntake over the disc's evolution and to evaluate this critical surface density as\na function of X-ray luminosity, stellar mass and inner hole radius. We find\nthat this critical surface density scales linearly with X-ray luminosity,\nincreases with inner hole radius and decreases with stellar mass and we develop\nan analytic model that reproduces these results.\n  This surface density criterion is then used to determine the evolutionary\nstate of protoplanetary discs at the point that they become unstable to\ndestruction by thermal sweeping. We find that transition discs created by\nphotoevaporation will undergo thermal sweeping when their inner holes reach\n20-40 AU, implying that transition discs with large holes and no accretion\n(which were previously a predicted outcome of the later stages of all flavours\nof photoevaporation model) will not form.\n  We emphasise that the surface density criteria that we have developed apply\nto all situations where the disc develops an inner hole that is optically thin\nto X-rays.

However, the nature of the mechanism responsible for the tidal\ndissipation in such systems remains uncertain. In this paper, we claim that the\nso-called elliptical instability may play a major role in these systems,\nexplaining some systematic features present in the observations. This\nhydrodynamic instability, arising in rotating flows with elliptical\nstreamlines, is suspected to be present in both planet and star of such\nsystems, which are elliptically deformed by tides. The presence and the\ninfluence of the elliptical instability in gaseous bodies, such as stars or hot\nJupiters, are most of the time neglected. In this paper, using numerical\nsimulations and theoretical arguments, we consider several features associated\nto the elliptical instability in hot-Jupiter systems. In particular, the use of\nad hoc boundary conditions makes it possible to estimate the amplitude of the\nelliptical instability in gaseous bodies. We also consider the influence of\ncompressibility on the elliptical instability, and compare the results to the\nincompressible case. We demonstrate the ability for the elliptical instability\nto grow in the presence of differential rotation, with a possible synchronized\nlatitude, provided that the tidal deformation and/or the rotation rate of the\nfluid are large enough. Moreover, the amplitude of the instability for a\ncentrally-condensed mass of fluid is of the same order of magnitude as for an\nincompressible fluid for a given distance to the threshold of the instability.\nFinally, we show that the assumption of the elliptical instability being the\nmain tidal dissipation process in eccentric inflated hot Jupiters and\nmisaligned stars is consistent with current data. \n\n"}

It is, however, extremely challenging to compute.\nThis paper presents a geometric-path Monte Carlo method, inspired by\nmulti-canonical Monte Carlo to evaluate the fully marginalized likelihood. We\nshow that the algorithm is very fast and easy to implement and produces a\njustified uncertainty estimate on the fully marginalized likelihood. The\nalgorithm performs efficiently on a trial problem and multi-companion model\nfitting for radial velocity data. For the trial problem, the algorithm returns\nthe correct fully marginalized likelihood, and the estimated uncertainty is\nalso consistent with the standard deviation of results from multiple runs.

The gravitational torque\non the disc from an inclined binary makes the disc precess around the binary\naxis, while the star-disc interaction torque due to the rotation-induced\nquadrupole makes the stellar spin and the disc angular momentum axes precess\naround each other. A significant star-disc misalignment angle can be generated\nfrom a small initial value as the star-disc system evolves in time such that\nthe two precession frequencies cross each other. This ``secular resonance''\nbehavior can be understood in a geometric way from the precession dynamics of\nspin and disc angular momenta. We derive the conditions for such resonance to\noccur, and find that they can be satisfied for reasonable protostar-disc-binary\nparameters. The evolution of star-disc inclination is also affected by mass\naccretion and by magnetic star-disc interaction torques, which can either\npromote or reduce star-disc misalignment.

Wind\n  Solutions at the Inner Disk Abstract: The gas dynamics of protoplanetary disks (PPDs) is largely controlled by\nnon-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects including Ohmic resistivity, the\nHall effect and ambipolar diffusion. Among these the role of the Hall effect is\nthe least explored and most poorly understood. We have included all three\nnon-ideal MHD effects in a self-consistent manner to investigate the role of\nthe Hall effect on PPD gas dynamics using local shearing-box simulations. In\nthis first paper, we focus on the inner region of PPDs, where previous studies\nexcluding the Hall effect have revealed that the inner disk up to ~10 AU is\nlargely laminar, with accretion driven by a magnetocentrifugal wind. We confirm\nthis basic picture and show that the Hall effect introduces modest\nmodifications to the wind solutions, depending on the polarity of the\nlarge-scale poloidal magnetic field B_0 threading the disk. When B_0.Omega>0,\nthe horizontal magnetic field is strongly amplified toward the disk interior,\nleading to a stronger disk wind (by ~50% or less in terms of the wind-driven\naccretion rate). The enhanced horizontal field also leads to much stronger\nlarge-scale Maxwell stress (magnetic braking) that contributes to a\nconsiderable fraction of the wind-driven accretion rate. When B_0.Omega<0, the\nhorizontal magnetic field is reduced, leading to a weaker disk wind (by ~20%)\nand negligible magnetic braking. Moreover, we find that when B_0.Omega>0, the\nlaminar region extends farther to ~15 AU before the magneto-rotational\ninstability sets in, while for B_0.Omega<0, the laminar region extends only to\n~3-5 AU for a typical PPD accretion rates. Scaling relations for the wind\nproperties, especially the wind-driven accretion rate, are provided for aligned\nand anti-aligned field geometries.

As a\nresult, star clusters and protostellar disks formed in large clouds should\nexhibit significant abundance spreads in the elements preferentially found in\nlarge grains. This naturally predicts populations of carbon-enhanced stars,\ncertain highly unusual stellar populations observed in nearby open clusters,\nand may explain the 'UV upturn' in early-type galaxies. It will also\ndramatically change planet formation in the resulting protostellar disks, by\npreferentially 'seeding' disks with an enhancement in large carbonaceous or\nsilicate grains. The relevant threshold for this behavior scales simply with\ncloud densities and temperatures, making straightforward predictions for\nclusters in starbursts and high-redshift galaxies. Because of the selective\nsorting by size, this process is not necessarily visible in extinction mapping.\nWe also predict the shape of the abundance distribution -- when these\nfluctuations occur, a small fraction of the cores may actually be seeded with\nabundances ~100 times the mean, such that they are almost 'totally metal'\n(Z~1)! Assuming the cores collapse, these totally metal stars would be rare (1\nin 10^4 in clusters where this occurs), but represent a fundamentally new\nstellar evolution channel. \n\n"}

The bright and\nwell studied HAT-P-7 system is intriguing as several Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM)\nmeasurements found a large projected obliquity in this system, but it was so\nfar not possible to determine if the orbit is polar and/or retrograde. The goal\nof this study is to measure the stellar inclination and hereby the full 3D\nobliquity of the HAT-P-7 system instead of only the 2D projection as measured\nby the RM effect. In addition we provide an updated set of stellar parameters\nfor the star. We use the full set of available observations from Kepler\nspanning Q0-Q17 to produce the power spectrum of HAT-P-7. We extract\noscillation mode frequencies via an MCMC peak-bagging routine, and use the\nresults from this to estimate the stellar inclination angle. Combining this\nwith the projected obliquity from RM and the inclination of the orbital plane\nallows us to determine the stellar obliquity. We use asteroseismology to model\nthe star from the extracted frequencies using two different approaches to the\nmodelling where either the MESA or the GARSTEC stellar evolution codes are\nadopted. Using our updated asteroseismic modelling we find, i.a., the following\nstellar parameters for HAT-P-7: M=1.51{+0.04}{-0.05}Msun,\n$R=2.00{+0.01}{-0.02}Rsun, and age = 2.07{+0.28}{-0.23} Gyr.

Our\napproach is to use the full kinetics model to survey the parameter space with\neffective temperatures between 500 K and 1100 K. In all of these worlds\nequilibrium chemistry favors CH4 over CO in the parts of the atmosphere that\ncan be seen from Earth, but in most disequilibrium favors CO. The small surface\ngravity of a planet strongly discriminates against CH4 when compared to an\notherwise comparable brown dwarf. If vertical mixing is like Jupiter's, the\ntransition from methane to CO occurs at 500 K in a planet. Sluggish vertical\nmixing can raise this to 600 K; but clouds or more vigorous vertical mixing\ncould lower this to 400 K. The comparable thresholds in brown dwarfs are\n$1100\\pm100$ K.

Furthermore, this probability rapidly approaches zero at increasing\norbital period. Therefore transit surveys have been predominantly limited to\nthe inner parts of exoplanetary systems. Here we demonstrate how circumbinary\nplanets allow us to beat these unfavourable odds. By incorporating the geometry\nand the three-body dynamics of circumbinary systems, we analytically derive the\nprobability of transitability, a configuration where the binary and planet\norbits overlap on the sky. We later show that this is equivalent to the transit\nprobability, but at an unspecified point in time. This probability, at its\nminimum, is always higher than for single star cases. In addition, it is an\nincreasing function with mutual inclination. By applying our analytical\ndevelopment to eclipsing binaries, we deduce that transits are highly probable,\nand in some case guaranteed. For example, a circumbinary planet revolving at 1\nAU around a 0.3 AU eclipsing binary is certain to eventually transit - a 100%\nprobability - if its mutual inclination is greater than 0.6 deg.

In preliminary\nanalyses of the Herschel DEBRIS and DUNES surveys, Wyatt et al. (2012) and\nMarshall et al. (2014) identified a tentative correlation between debris and\nlow-mass planets. Here we use the cleanest possible sample out these surveys to\nassess the presence of such a correlation, discarding stars without known ages,\nwith ages < 1 Gyr and with binary companions <100 AU, to rule out possible\ncorrelations due to effects other than planet presence.

We collect these easily evaluated\nconstraints into a workflow that can help guide the design and interpretation\nof new observational campaigns and numerical simulations of gap opening in such\nsystems. We argue that the locations of resonances should be significantly\nshifted in massive disks like HL Tau, and that theoretical uncertainties in the\nexact offset, together with observational errors, imply a large uncertainty in\nthe dynamical state and stability in such disks. This presents an important\nbarrier to using systems like HL Tau as a proxy for the initial conditions\nfollowing planet formation. An important observational avenue to breaking this\ndegeneracy is to search for eccentric gaps, which could implicate resonantly\ninteracting planets. Unfortunately, massive disks like HL Tau should induce\nswift pericenter precession that would smear out any such eccentric features of\nplanetary origin. This motivates pushing toward more typical, less massive\ndisks.

The method takes advantage of the different distributions\nalong the line of sight (LOS) of total (tB) and polarized (pB) brightnesses to\nestimate the average location of the emitting plasma. To this end, we assumed\ntwo simple electron density distributions along the LOS (a constant density and\nGaussian density profiles) for a plasma blob and synthesized the expected tB\nand pB for different distances $z$ of the blob from the plane of the sky (POS)\nand different projected altitudes $\\rho$. Reconstructed locations of the blob\nalong the LOS were thus compared with the real ones, allowing a precise\ndetermination of uncertainties in the method. Independently of the analytical\ndensity profile, when the blob is centered at a small distance from the POS\n(i.e. for limb CMEs) the distance from the POS starts to be significantly\noverestimated. Polarization ratio technique provides the LOS position of the\ncenter of mass of what we call folded density distribution, given by reflecting\nand summing in front of the POS the fraction of density profile located behind\nthat plane. On the other hand, when the blob is far from the POS, but with very\nsmall projected altitudes (i.e. for halo CMEs, $\\rho < 1.4$ R$_\\odot$), the\ninferred distance from that plane is significantly underestimated. Better\ndetermination of the real blob position along the LOS is given for intermediate\nlocations, and in particular when the blob is centered at an angle of\n$20^\\circ$ from the POS.

The fraction of\nFFPs that experiences a close encounter depends on both the stellar density and\nthe initial velocity distribution of the FFPs.

These orbits have forced eccentric motion aligned\nwith the binary as well as higher frequency oscillations, yet they do not\ncross, even in the presence of massive disks and perturbations from large\nplanets. For this reason, dissipative gas and planetesimals can settle onto\nthese \"most circular\" orbits, facilitating the growth of protoplanets.

Here we analyze\nKepler-12b and Kepler-41b atmosphere based on their Kepler phase curve, while\nthe analysis of Kepler-7b was presented elsewhere. The model we used\nefficiently computes reflection and thermal emission contributions to the phase\ncurve, including inhomogeneous atmospheric reflection due to longitudinally\nvarying cloud coverage. We confirm Kepler-12b and Kepler-41b show a westward\nphase shift between the brightest region on the planetary surface and the\nsubstellar point, similar to Kepler-7b.

To use observational resources most\nefficiently we need to know where the largest, most easily detected moons can\nform. We explore the possibility of large exomoons by following the movement of\nwater (H2O) ice lines in the accretion disks around young super-Jovian planets.\nWe want to know how different heating sources in those disks affect the H2O ice\nlines. We simulate 2D rotationally symmetric accretion disks in hydrostatic\nequilibrium around super-Jovian exoplanets. The energy terms in our\nsemi-analytical model -- (1) viscous heating, (2) planetary illumination, (3)\naccretional heating, and (4) stellar illumination -- are fed by precomputed\nplanet evolution tracks. We consider planets accreting 1 to 12 Jupiter masses\nat distances between 1 and 20 AU to a Sun-like star. Accretion disks around\nJupiter-mass planets closer than ~4.5 AU to Sun-like stars do not feature H2O\nice lines, but the most massive super-Jovians can form icy satellites as close\nas ~3 AU to Sun-like stars. Super-Jovian planets forming beyond ~5 AU can host\nMars-mass moons. We study a broad range of disk parameters for planets at 5.2\nAU and find that the H2O ice lines are universally between ~15 and 30 Jupiter\nradii when the last generation of moons is forming. If the abundant population\nof super-Jovian planets at ~1 AU formed in situ, then they should lack giant\nicy moons because their disks did not host H2O ice in the final stages of\naccretion. In the more likely case that these planets migrated to their current\nlocations from beyond a few AU, they might be orbited by large, H2O-rich moons.\nIn this case, Mars-mass ocean moons might be common in the stellar habitable\nzones.

In multi-planet systems,\nconvergent amassing of orbits inevitably leads to encounters with rational\nperiod ratios, which may result in establishment of mean motion resonances. The\nsuccess or failure of resonant capture yields exceedingly different subsequent\nevolutions, and thus plays a central role in determining the ensuing orbital\narchitecture of planetary systems. In this work, we employ an integrable\nHamiltonian formalism for first order planetary resonances that allows both\nsecondary bodies to have finite masses and eccentricities, and construct a\ncomprehensive theory for resonant capture. Particularly, we derive conditions\nunder which orbital evolution lies within the adiabatic regime, and provide a\ngeneralized criterion for guaranteed resonant locking as well as a procedure\nfor calculating capture probabilities when capture is not certain.\nSubsequently, we utilize the developed analytical model to examine the\nevolution of Jupiter and Saturn within the protosolar nebula, and investigate\nthe origins of the dominantly non-resonant orbital distribution of sub-Jovian\nextrasolar planets. Our calculations show that the commonly observed extrasolar\norbital structure can be understood if planet pairs encounter mean motion\ncommensurabilities on slightly eccentric (e~0.02) orbits.

Here, we establish equations that can model\ntime-varying GB stellar radiation, wind drag and mass loss. We derive the\ncomplete three-dimensional equations of motion in orbital elements due to (1)\nthe Epstein and Stokes regimes of stellar wind drag, (2) Poynting-Robertson\ndrag, and (3) the Yarkovsky drift with seasonal and diurnal components. We\nprove through averaging that the potential secular eccentricity and inclination\nexcitation due to Yarkovsky drift can exceed that from Poynting-Robertson drag\nand radiation pressure by at least three orders of magnitude, possibly flinging\nasteroids which survive YORP spin-up into a widely dispersed cloud around the\nresulting white dwarf. The GB Yarkovsky effect alone may change an asteroid's\norbital eccentricity by ten per cent in just one Myr.

Here\nwe propose that a potential outcome of this atmospheric evolution is the\nformation of helium-dominated atmospheres. The hydrodynamic escape rates of\nNeptune- and sub-Neptune-sized exoplanets are comparable to the\ndiffusion-limited escape rate of hydrogen, and therefore the escape is heavily\naffected by diffusive separation between hydrogen and helium. A helium\natmosphere can thus be formed -- from a primordial hydrogen-helium atmosphere\n-- via atmospheric hydrodynamic escape from the planet. The helium atmosphere\nhas very different abundances of major carbon and oxygen species from those of\na hydrogen atmosphere, leading to distinctive transmission and thermal emission\nspectral features. In particular, the hypothesis of a helium-dominated\natmosphere can explain the thermal emission spectrum of GJ 436 b, a warm\nNeptune-sized exoplanet, while also consistent with the transmission spectrum.\nThis model atmosphere contains trace amounts of hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen,\nwith the predominance of CO over CH4 as the main form of carbon.

The size of the disk is\nsignificantly affected by a simple difference in the inherent properties of the\nprestellar core, namely whether the rotation vector and the magnetic field are\nparallel or anti- parallel. In the former case, only a very small disk (< 1 AU)\nis formed. On the other hand, in the latter case, a massive and large (> 20 AU)\ndisk is formed in the early phase of protostar formation.

Tidal dissipation in stellar\nconvective envelopes is a key actor that shapes the orbital architecture of\nshort-period systems. Our objective is to understand and evaluate how tidal\ndissipation in the convective envelope of low-mass stars (from M to F types)\ndepends on their mass, evolutionary stage and rotation. Using a simplified\ntwo-layer assumption, we compute analytically the frequency-averaged tidal\ndissipation in their convective envelope. This dissipation is due to the\nconversion into heat of the kinetic energy of tidal non wave-like/equilibrium\nflow and inertial waves because of the viscous friction applied by turbulent\nconvection. Using grids of stellar models allows us to study the variation of\nthe dissipation as a function of stellar mass and age on the Pre-Main-Sequence\nand on the Main-Sequence for stars with masses spanning from $0.4$ to\n$1.4M_{\\odot}$. As shown by observations, tidal dissipation in stars varies\nover several orders of magnitude as a function of stellar mass, age and\nrotation.

Finally, the rotational\nevolution of low-mass stars strengthens the importance of tidal dissipation\nduring the Pre-Main-Sequence for star-planet and multiple star systems. \n\n"}

In primarily neutral regions, dust grains move as aerodynamic particles,\nnot necessarily with the gas. We therefore directly simulate, for the first\ntime, the behavior of aerodynamic grains in highly supersonic,\nmagnetohydrodynamic turbulence typical of MCs. We show that, under these\nconditions, grains with sizes a >0.01 micron exhibit dramatic (exceeding factor\n~1000) fluctuations in the local dust-to-gas ratio (implying large small-scale\nvariations in abundances, dust cooling rates, and dynamics). The dust can form\nhighly filamentary structures (which would be observed in both dust emission\nand extinction), which can be much thinner than the characteristic width of gas\nfilaments. Sometimes, the dust and gas filaments are not even in the same\nlocation. The 'clumping factor' of the dust (critical for dust\ngrowth/coagulation/shattering) can reach ~100, for grains in the ideal size\nrange. The dust clustering is maximized around scales ~0.2pc*(a/micron)*(100\ncm^-3/n_gas), and is 'averaged out' on larger scales. However, because the\ndensity varies widely in supersonic turbulence, the dynamic range of scales\n(and interesting grain sizes) for these fluctuations is much broader than in\nthe subsonic case. Our results are applicable to MCs of essentially all sizes\nand densities, but we note how Lorentz forces and other physics (neglected\nhere) may change them in some regimes.

We find that M dwarf stars have 3.5 times more small planets\n(1.0-2.8 R_Earth) than main-sequence FGK stars, but two times fewer\nNeptune-sized and larger planets (>2.8 R_Earth). We find no systematic trend in\nthe planet size distribution between spectral types F, G, and K to explain the\nincreasing occurrence rates. Taking into account the mass-radius relationship\nand heavy-element mass of observed exoplanets, and assuming those are\nindependent of spectral type, we derive the inventory of the heavy-element mass\nlocked up in exoplanets at short orbits. The overall higher planet occurrence\nrates around M stars are not consistent with the redistribution of the same\nmass into more, smaller planets. At the orbital periods and planet radii where\nKepler observations are complete for all spectral types, the average\nheavy-element mass locked up in exoplanets increases roughly inversely with\nstellar mass from 4 M_Earth in F stars to 5 M_Earth in G and K stars to 7\nM_Earth in M stars.

Neither models of in situ\nformation nor migration of fully-formed planets are consistent with these\nresults. Instead, these results are indicative of large-scale inward migration\nof planetary building blocks --- either through type-I migration or radial\ndrift of dust grains --- that is more efficient for lower mass stars, but does\nnot result in significantly larger or smaller planets. \n\n"}

We conduct a\nlarge population synthesis study, including the octupole gravitational\npotential from the stellar companion, mutual precession of the host stellar\nspin axis and planet orbital axis, tidal dissipation in the planet, and stellar\nspin-down in the host star due to magnetic braking.

A large fraction of the observational sample contains\nlimited multiplicity, begging the question whether there is a true diversity of\nmulti transiting systems, or if some systems merely possess high mutual\ninclinations, allowing them to appear as single-transiting systems in a\ntransit-based survey. This paper begins an exploration of the effectiveness of\ndynamical mechanisms in exciting orbital inclination within exoplanetary\nsystems of this class. For these tightly packed systems, we determine that the\norbital inclination angles are not spread out appreciably through\nself-excitation. In contrast, the two Kepler multi-planet systems with\nadditional non-transiting planets are susceptible to oscillations of their\ninclination angles, which means their currently observed configurations could\nbe due to planet-planet interactions alone. We also provide constraints and\npredictions for the expected transit duration variations (TDVs) for each\nplanet. In these multi-planet compact Kepler systems, oscillations of their\ninclination angles are remarkably hard to excite; as a result, they tend to\nremain continually mutually transiting (CMT-stable).

A slowdown in\nthe evolutionary cooling prior to equilibrium is possible only for sources\nwhich do not extend to the planet's center.

We explore the effect of radial drift of solids and viscous gas\naccretion onto the central star on the snowline locations of the main C and O\ncarriers in a protoplanetary disk, H2O, CO2 and CO, and their consequences for\nthe C/O ratio in gas and dust throughout the disk. We determine the snowline\nlocations for a range of fixed initial particle sizes and disk types. For our\nfiducial disk model, we find that grains with sizes ~0.5 cm < s < 7 m for an\nirradiated disk, and ~0.001 cm < s < 7 m for an evolving and viscous disk,\ndesorb at a size-dependent location in the disk, which is independent of the\nparticle's initial position. The snowline radius decreases for larger\nparticles, up to sizes of ~7 m. Compared to a static disk, we find that radial\ndrift and gas accretion in a viscous disk move the H2O snowline inwards by up\nto 40%, the CO2 snowline by up to 60%, and the CO snowline by up to 50%.

Specifically, we run numerical simulations\nto determine whether strong, resonant (or non-resonant) planet-planet\ninteractions can cause large variations in planet obliquity---thereby inducing\nlarge variations in climate.

A bow\nshock invariably forms ahead of the magnetosphere, but the pre-shock gas is\nonly mildly supersonic (with typical Mach numbers of $\\simeq$1.6-1.8) so the\nshock is weak.

In\nthis late stage, a significant amount of ice could have been delivered to 1 AU\nfrom outer regions in the form of mm to dm-sized pebbles. This raises the\nquestion why the present Earth is so depleted of water (with the ocean mass\nbeing as small as 0.023% of the Earth mass). Here we quantify the amount of icy\npebbles accreted by terrestrial embryos after the migration of the snow line\nassuming that no mechanism halts the pebble flow in outer disk regions. We use\na simplified version of the coagulation equation to calculate the formation and\nradial inward drift of icy pebbles in a protoplanetary disk. The pebble\naccretion cross section of an embryo is calculated using analytic expressions\npresented by recent studies. We find that the final mass and water content of\nterrestrial embryos strongly depends on the radial extent of the gas disk, the\nstrength of disk turbulence, and the time at which the snow lines arrives at 1\nAU. The disk's radial extent sets the lifetime of the pebble flow, while\nturbulence determines the density of pebbles at the midplane where the embryos\nreside. We find that the final water content of the embryos falls below 0.023\nwt% only if the disk is compact (< 100 AU), turbulence is strong at 1 AU, and\nthe snow line arrives at 1 AU later than 2-4 Myr after disk formation.

By combining the new\nHerschel spectra with archival Spitzer-IRS spectroscopy, we retrieve a\nparameterized radial surface water vapor distribution from 0.1-100 AU using\ntwo-dimensional dust and line radiative transfer modeling. The surface water\ndistribution is modeled with a step model comprising of a constant inner and\nouter relative water abundance and a critical radius at which the surface water\nabundance is allowed to change. We find that the four disks have critical radii\nof $\\sim 3-11$ AU, at which the surface water abundance decreases by at least 5\norders of magnitude. The measured values for the critical radius are\nconsistently smaller than the location of the surface snow line, as predicted\nby the observed spectral energy distribution. This suggests that the sharp\ndrop-off of the surface water abundance is not solely due to the local\ngas-solid balance, but may also be driven by the de-activation of gas-phase\nchemical pathways to water below 300 K.

Assuming that these arms are\ndensity waves, evolving into spiral shocks, we assess their effect on the\nthermodynamics, accretion, and global evolution of the disk. We derive\nanalytical expressions for the direct (irreversible) heating, angular momentum\ntransport, and mass accretion rate induced by the disk shocks of arbitrary\nstrength. We find these processes to be very sensitive to the shock amplitude.\nFocusing on the waves of moderate strength (density jump at the shock\n$\\Delta\\Sigma/\\Sigma\\sim 1$) we show the associated disk heating to be\nnegligible (contributing at $\\sim 1\\%$ level to the energy budget) in passive,\nirradiated protoplanetary disks on $\\sim 100$ AU scales, but becoming important\nwithin several AU from the star. At the same time, shock heating can be a\nsignificant (or even dominant) energy source in disks of cataclysmic variables,\nstellar X-ray binaries, and supermassive black hole binaries, heated mainly by\nviscous dissipation. Mass accretion induced by the global spiral shocks is\ncomparable to (or exceeds) the mass inflow due to viscous stresses.\nProtoplanetary disks featuring prominent global spirals must be evolving\nrapidly, in $\\lesssim 0.5$ Myr at $\\sim 100$ AU. A direct upper limit on the\ndisk evolution timescale can be established via the measurement of the\ngravitational torque due to the spiral arms from the imaging data.

Here, I provide a light curve of 1338 Johnson B-band\nmagnitudes from 1890 to 1989 taken from archival photographic plates at\nHarvard. KIC8462852 displays a secular dimming at an average rate of\n0.164+-0.013 magnitudes per century. From the early-1890s to the late-1980s,\nKIC8462852 faded by 0.193+-0.030 mag. The decline is not an artifact because\nnearby check stars have closely flat light curves. This century-long dimming is\nunprecedented for any F-type main sequence star. Thus the Harvard light curve\nprovides the first confirmation (past the several dips seen in the Kepler light\ncurve alone) that KIC8462852 has anything unusual. The century-long dimming and\nthe day-long dips are both just extreme ends of a spectrum of timescales for\nunique dimming events. By Ockham's Razor, two such unique and similar effects\nare very likely produced by one physical mechanism. This one mechanism does not\nappear as any isolated catastrophic event in the last century, but rather must\nbe some ongoing process with continuous effects. Within the context of\ndust-occultation models, the century-long dimming trend requires 10^4 to 10^7\ntimes as much dust as for the deepest Kepler dip. Within the context of the\ncomet-family idea, the century-long dimming trend requires an estimated 648,000\ngiant comets (each with 200 km diameter) all orchestrated to pass in front of\nthe star within the last century. \n\n"}

In parallel, the HMI\ninstrument onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory provided us with simultaneous\nhigh spatial resolution magnetograms, Dopplergrams, and continuum images of the\nSun in the Fe I 6173A line.

We study the possibility that the warm Jupiters\nare undergoing secular eccentricity oscillations excited by an outer companion\n(a planet or star) in an eccentric and/or mutually inclined orbit. In this\nmodel the warm Jupiters migrate periodically, in the high-eccentricity phase of\nthe oscillation when the pericenter distance is small, but are typically\nobserved at much lower eccentricities. We show that the steady-state\neccentricity distribution of the warm Jupiters migrating by this mechanism is\napproximately flat, which is consistent with the observed distribution if and\nonly if we restrict the sample to warm Jupiters that have outer companions\ndetected by radial-velocity surveys. The eccentricity distribution of warm\nJupiters without companions exhibits a peak at low eccentricities ($e\\lesssim\n0.2$) that must be explained by a different formation mechanism.

We show that the majority of the observed Jupiter\npairs (twenty out of twenty-four) will be dynamically unstable if the inner\nplanet was placed at >~1AU distance from the stellar host. This finding is at\nodds with formation theories that invoke the migration of such planets from\nsemi-major axes >~1AU due to secular dynamical processes (e.g., secular chaos,\nLidov-Kozai oscillations) coupled with tidal dissipation. In fact, the results\nof N-body integrations show that the evolution of dynamically unstable systems\ndoes not lead to tidal migration but rather to planet ejections and collisions\nwith the host star.

It was recently claimed that the KBOs concerned\nby this dynamics are presumably trapped in mean motion resonances with the\nsuspected planet. I reinvestigate here the secular model underlying this idea.\nThe original analysis was done expanding and truncating the secular\nHamiltonian.

From our study, orange main-sequence\nstars, ranging from spectral type late-G to mid-K (with a maximum at early-K),\nare most promising. Our analysis considers a variety of aspects, including (1)\nthe frequency of the various types of stars, (2) the speed of stellar evolution\ntheir lifetimes, (3) the size of the stellar climatological habitable zones\n(CLI-HZs), (4) the strengths and persistence of their magnetic dynamo generated\nX-ray - UV emissions, and (5) the frequency and severity of flares, including\nsuperflares; both (4) and (5) greatly reduce the suitability of red dwarfs to\nhost life-bearing planets.

Five of the systems experience at least one\nRoche-lobe overflow and common-envelope stages (Kepler-1647 experiences three),\nand the binary stars either shrink to very short orbits or coalesce; two\nsystems trigger a double-degenerate supernova explosion. Kepler's circumbinary\nplanets predominantly remain gravitationally bound at the end of the\ncommon-envelope phase, migrate to larger orbits, and may gain significant\neccentricity; their orbital expansion can be more than an order of magnitude\nand can occur over the course of a single planetary orbit.

Abstract: Photometry of short-period planetary systems allows astronomers to monitor\nexoplanets, their host stars, and their mutual interactions. In addition to the\ntransits of a planet in front of its star and the eclipses of the planet by its\nstar, researchers have reported flux variations at the orbital frequency and\nits harmonics: planetary reflection and/or emission and Doppler beaming of\nstarlight produce one peak per orbit, while ellipsoidal variations of a tidally\ndistorted star and/or planet produce two maxima per orbit. Researchers have\nalso reported significant photometric variability at three times the orbital\nfrequency, sometimes much greater than the predictions of tidal theory. The\nreflected phase variations of a homogeneous planet contains power at even\norbital harmonics-important for studies of ellipsoidal variations-but cannot\ncontain odd orbital harmonics. We show that odd harmonics can, however, be\nproduced by an edge-on planet with a time-variable map, or an inclined planet\nwith a North-South (N-S) asymmetric map. Either of these scenarios entail\nweather: short-period planets are expected to have zero obliquity and hence N-S\nsymmetric stellar forcing. North-South asymmetry in a giant planet would\ntherefore suggest stochastic localized features, such as weather. However, we\nfind that previous claims of large-amplitude odd modes in Kepler photometry are\nartifacts of removing planetary transits rather than modeling them. The only\nreliable claims of odd harmonics remain HAT-P-7b and Kepler-13Ab, for which the\nthird mode amplitude is 6-8% of the planetary flux. Although time-variable\nalbedo maps could in principle explain these odd harmonics, upper-limits on the\ninfrared variability of hot Jupiters make this hypothesis unlikely. We urge\ntheorists to study the effects of close-in planets on stellar atmospheres, as\nthis remains the only plausible hypothesis. \n\n"}

Even though, the principles of\nsingle stellar evolution and binary evolution, have been accepted for a long\ntime, the long-term evolution of stellar triples is poorly understood. The\npresence of a third star in an orbit around a binary system can significantly\nalter the evolution of those stars and the binary system. The rich dynamical\nbehavior in three-body systems can give rise to Lidov-Kozai cycles, in which\nthe eccentricity of the inner orbit and the inclination between the inner and\nouter orbit vary periodically. In turn, this can lead to an enhancement of\ntidal effects (tidal friction), gravitational-wave emission and stellar\ninteractions such as mass transfer and collisions. The lack of a\nself-consistent treatment of triple evolution, including both three-body\ndynamics as well as stellar evolution, hinders the systematic study and general\nunderstanding of the long-term evolution of triple systems. In this paper, we\naim to address some of these hiatus, by discussing the dominant physical\nprocesses of hierarchical triple evolution, and presenting heuristic recipes\nfor these processes. To improve our understanding on hierarchical stellar\ntriples, these descriptions are implemented in a public source code TrES which\ncombines three-body dynamics (based on the secular approach) with stellar\nevolution and their mutual influences. Note that modeling through a phase of\nstable mass transfer in an eccentric orbit is currently not implemented in TrES\n, but can be implemented with the appropriate methodology at a later stage. \n\n"}

A\nrepresentation is needed for how much the machine's policy will prioritize each\nplayer's interests over time.

We revisit the issue of grain alignment\nfor large grains expected in the protoplanetary disks and find that mm-sized\ngrains at midplane do not align with the magnetic field as the Larmor\nprecession timescale for such large grains becomes longer than the gaseous\ndamping timescale. Hence, for these grains the RAT theory predicts that the\nalignment axis is determined by the grain precession with respect to the\nradiative flux. As a result, we expect that the polarization will be in the\nazimuthal direction for a face-on disk.

We\nperformed a series of 3D SPH hydrodynamic simulations and combined them with 3D\nradiative transfer calculations to study the observability of warps in\ncircumbinary discs, whose plane is misaligned with respect to the orbital plane\nof the central binary. Our numerical hydrodynamic simulations confirm previous\nanalytical results on the dependence of the warp structure on the viscosity and\nthe initial misalignment between the binary and the disc. To study the\nobservational signatures of warps we calculate images in the continuum at\nnear-infrared and sub-millimetre wavelengths and in the pure rotational\ntransition of CO in the sub-millimetre. Warped circumbinary discs show surface\nbrightness asymmetry in near-infrared scattered light images as well as in\noptically thick gas lines at sub-millimetre wavelengths. The asymmetry is\ncaused by self-shadowing of the disc by the inner warped regions, thus the\nstrength of the asymmetry depends on the strength of the warp. The projected\nvelocity field, derived from line observations, shows characteristic\ndeviations, twists and a change in the slope of the rotation curve, from that\nof an unperturbed disc.

These objects are a missing link in two ways: (1) for probing\nmoderately massive BHs and (2) for understanding the hydrodynamics of the\ndisruption of objects with tenuous envelopes. A flare arising from the tidal\ndisruption of a $0.17~M_\\odot$ white dwarf by a $10^5~M_\\odot$ BH reaches a\nmaximum between 0.6 and 11 days, with a peak fallback rate that is usually\nsuper-Eddington and results in a flare that is likely brighter than a typical\ntidal disruption event.

The targets are selected to probe the obliquity against\na wide range of stellar and planetary physical parameters. We exploit\nhigh-precision radial velocity (RV) measurements, delivered by the HARPS-N\nspectrograph at the 3.6m Telescopio Nazionale Galileo, to measure the\nRossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect in RV time-series bracketing planet transits,\nand to refine the orbital parameters determinations with out-of-transit RV\ndata. We also analyse new transit light curves obtained with several 1-2m class\ntelescopes to better constrain the physical fundamental parameters of the\nplanets and parent stars. We report here on new transit spectroscopic\nobservations for three very massive close-in giant planets: WASP43b, HATP20b\nand Qatar2b orbiting dwarf K-type stars with effective temperature well below\n5000K.

Which mechanisms are responsible for the disc\ndissipation is still debated. Here we investigate the movement through an\nambient medium as a possible cause of disc dispersal. The ram pressure exerted\nby the flow can truncate the disc and the accretion of material with no\nazimuthal angular momentum leads to further disc contraction. We derive a\ntheoretical model from accretion disc theory that describes the evolution of\nthe disc radius, mass, and surface density profile as a function of the density\nand velocity of the ambient medium. We test our model by performing\nhydrodynamical simulations of a protoplanetary disc embedded in a flow with\ndifferent velocities and densities. We find that our model gives an adequate\ndescription of the evolution of the disc radius and accretion rate onto the\ndisc. The total disc mass in the simulations follows the theoretically expected\ntrend, except at the lowest density where our simulated discs lose mass owing\nto continuous stripping. This stripping may be a numerical rather than a\nphysical effect. Some quantitative differences exist between the model\npredictions and the simulations. These are at least partly caused by numerical\nviscous effects in the disc and depend on the resolution of the simulation. Our\nmodel can be used as a conservative estimate for the process of face-on\naccretion onto protoplanetary discs, as long as viscous processes in the disc\ncan be neglected. The model predicts that in dense gaseous environments, discs\ncan shrink substantially in size and can, in theory, sweep up an amount of gas\nof the order of their initial mass.

Tidal interactions may have played an important role in\nthe evolution of the spin-orbit angle. In this study, we investigate the tidal\ninteractions in spin-orbit misaligned systems. In particular, we focus on the\ntidal response of a rotating fluid body to the obliquity tide, which may be\nimportant for the evolution of the spin-orbit angle but hardly affects the\norbital evolution. The obliquity tide also provides a torque for the mutual\nprecession of the spin and orbital axes around the total angular momentum\nvector, which has not yet been considered in previous studies on the tidal\ninteractions. In this paper, we first formulate a set of linearized equations\ndescribing the tidal response in spin-orbit misaligned systems, taking into\naccount the precessional motion. Numerical solutions in a homogeneous fluid and\nin a polytrope of index 1 show that dissipative inertial waves can be excited\non top of precession by the obliquity tide in the presence of a rigid core. The\ntidal quality factor associated with the obliquity tide $Q'_{210}$ can be\nseveral orders of magnitude smaller than those associated with other tidal\ncomponents if their frequencies fall outside the frequency range of inertial\nwaves.

Gaussian Processes are a popular class of models used for this\npurpose but, since the computational cost scales, in general, as the cube of\nthe number of data points, their application has been limited to small\ndatasets. In this paper, we present a novel method for Gaussian Process\nmodeling in one-dimension where the computational requirements scale linearly\nwith the size of the dataset. We demonstrate the method by applying it to\nsimulated and real astronomical time series datasets. These demonstrations are\nexamples of probabilistic inference of stellar rotation periods, asteroseismic\noscillation spectra, and transiting planet parameters. The method exploits\nstructure in the problem when the covariance function is expressed as a mixture\nof complex exponentials, without requiring evenly spaced observations or\nuniform noise. This form of covariance arises naturally when the process is a\nmixture of stochastically-driven damped harmonic oscillators -- providing a\nphysical motivation for and interpretation of this choice -- but we also\ndemonstrate that it can be a useful effective model in some other cases. We\npresent a mathematical description of the method and compare it to existing\nscalable Gaussian Process methods.

We investigate the linear stability of KL modes for tilted\ninviscid discs under the approximations that the disc eccentricity is small and\nthe disc remains flat. By using 1D equations, we are able to probe regimes of\nlarge ratios of outer to inner disc edge radii that are realistic for binary\nsystems of hundreds of AU separations and are not easily probed by\nmulti-dimensional simulations. For order unity binary mass ratios, KL\ninstability is possible for a window of disc aspect ratios H/r in the outer\nparts of a disc that roughly scale as (n_b/n)^2 < H/r < n_b/n, for binary\norbital frequency n_b and orbital frequency n at the disc outer edge.

The origin\nof this difference is still debated, with both radial drift of the dust and\noptical depth effects suggested in the literature. In this work, the feedback\nof realistic dust particle distributions onto the gas chemistry and molecular\nemissivity is investigated, with a particular focus on CO isotopologues. The\nradial dust grain size distribution is determined using dust evolution models\nthat include growth, fragmentation and radial drift. A new version of the code\nDALI is used to take into account how dust surface area and density influence\nthe disk thermal structure, molecular abundances and excitation. The difference\nof dust and gas radial sizes is largely due to differences in the optical depth\nof CO lines and millimeter continuum, without the need to invoke radial drift.\nThe effect of radial drift is primarily visible in the sharp outer edge of the\ncontinuum intensity profile. The gas outer radius probed by $^{12}$CO emission\ncan easily differ by a factor of $\\sim 2$ between the models for a turbulent\n$\\alpha$ ranging between typical values. Grain growth and settling concur in\nthermally decoupling the gas and dust components, due to the low collision rate\nwith large grains. As a result, the gas can be much colder than the dust at\nintermediate heights, reducing the CO excitation and emission, especially for\nlow turbulence values. Also, due to disk mid-plane shadowing, a second CO\nthermal desorption (rather than photodesorption) front can occur in the warmer\nouter mid-plane disk. The models are compared to ALMA observations of HD 163296\nas a test case. In order to reproduce the observed CO snowline of the system, a\nbinding energy for CO typical of ice mixtures needs to be used rather than the\nlower pure CO value. \n\n"}

The\nresulting surface density profile of the disc is investigated for one\ndimensional and two dimensional disc models and, in agreement with previous\nwork, it is found that one dimensional gaps are significantly deeper than their\ntwo dimensional counterparts for the same initial conditions. We find, by\napplying one dimensional torque density distributions to two dimensional discs\ncontaining no planet, that the excitement of the Rossby wave instability and\nthe formation of Rossby vortices play a critical role in setting the\nequilibrium depth of the gap. Being a two dimensional instability, this is\nabsent from one dimensional simulations and does not limit the equilibrium gap\ndepth there. We find similar gap depths between two dimensional gaps formed by\ntorque density distributions, in which the Rossby wave instability is present,\nand two dimensional planet gaps, in which no Rossby wave instability is\npresent. This can be understood if the planet gap is maintained at marginal\nstability, even when there is no obvious Rossby wave instability present.\nFurther investigation shows the final equilibrium gap depth is very sensitive\nto the form of the applied torque density distribution, and using improved one\ndimensional approximations from three dimensional simulations can go even\nfurther to reducing the discrepancy between one and two dimensional models,\nespecially for lower mass planets.

This problem thus far has largely been addressed only by\nconsidering two objects: the star and the planet itself. However, many systems\nhave been found to harbor multiple planets, with some in or very near to\nmean-motion resonances. The presence of a planetary companion near a\nmean-motion resonance can induce oscillatory variations in the mean-motion of\nthe planet, which we demonstrate can have significant effects on the spin-state\nof an otherwise synchronously rotating planet. In particular, we find that a\nplanetary companion near a mean-motion resonance can excite the spin states of\nplanets in the habitable zone of small, cool stars, pushing otherwise\nsynchronously rotating planets into higher amplitude librations of the spin\nstate, or even complete circulation resulting in effective stellar days with\nfull surface coverage on the order of years or decades. This increase in\nilluminated area can have potentially dramatic influences on climate, and thus\non habitability.

From the PMS to the RGB at solar\n  metallicity Abstract: Star-planet interactions must be taken into account in stellar models to\nunderstand the dynamical evolution of close-in planets. The dependence of the\ntidal interactions on the structural and rotational evolution of the star is of\npeculiar importance and should be correctly treated. We quantify how tidal\ndissipation in the convective envelope of rotating low-mass stars evolves from\nthe pre-main sequence up to the red-giant branch depending on the initial\nstellar mass. We investigate the consequences of this evolution on planetary\norbital evolution. We couple the tidal dissipation formalism described in\nMathis (2015) to the stellar evolution code STAREVOL and apply it to rotating\nstars with masses between 0.3 and 1.4 M$_\\odot$. In addition, we generalize the\nwork of Bolmont & Mathis (2016) by following the orbital evolution of close-in\nplanets using the new tidal dissipation predictions for advanced phases of\nstellar evolution. On the PMS the evolution of tidal dissipation is controlled\nby the evolution of the internal structure of the contracting star. On the MS\nit is strongly driven by the variation of surface rotation that is impacted by\nmagnetized stellar winds braking. The main effect of taking into account the\nrotational evolution of the stars is to lower the tidal dissipation strength by\nabout four orders of magnitude on the main-sequence, compared to a normalized\ndissipation rate that only takes into account structural changes. The evolution\nof the dissipation strongly depends on the evolution of the internal structure\nand rotation of the star. From the pre-main sequence up to the tip of the\nred-giant branch, it varies by several orders of magnitude, with strong\nconsequences for the orbital evolution of close-in massive planets. These\neffects are the strongest during the pre-main sequence, implying that the\nplanets are mainly sensitive to the star's early history. \n\n"}

As these planets are likely tidal-locked,\nimproved 3D numerical simulations of such planetary atmospheres are needed to\nguide target selection. Here we use a 3-D climate system model, updated with\nnew water-vapor absorption coefficients derived from the HITRAN 2012 database,\nto study ocean covered planets at the inner edge of the HZ around late-M to\nmid-K stars ($2600$ K <= Teff <= 4500K). Our results indicate that these\nupdated water-vapor coefficients result in significant warming compared to\nprevious studies, so the inner HZ around M-dwarfs is not as close as suggested\nby earlier work. Assuming synchronously rotating planets with background 1 bar\nN2 atmospheres, we find that planets at the inner HZ of stars with Teff > 3000K\nundergo the classical \"moist-greenhouse\" (H2O mixing ratio > 10-3 in the\nstratosphere) at significantly lower surface temperature (~ 280K) in our 3-D\nmodel compared with 1-D climate models (~ 340K).

We investigate here the\ncollisional history of asteroid (6) Hebe and challenge the idea that Hebe may\nbe the parent body of ordinary H chondrites, the most common type of meteorites\nfound on Earth (~34% of the falls). Methods. We observed Hebe with SPHERE as\npart of the science verification of the instrument.

The radius distribution of the Kepler planets is\nshown to be bimodal, with a ``valley' separating two peaks at 1.3 and 2.6\nRearth. Such an ``evaporation-valley' had been predicted by numerical models\npreviously. Here, we develop a minimal model to demonstrate that this valley\nresults from the following fact: the timescale for envelope erosion is the\nlongest for those planets with hydrogen/helium-rich envelopes that, while only\na few percent in weight, double its radius. The timescale falls for envelopes\nlighter than this because the planet's radius remains largely constant for\ntenuous envelopes. The timescale also drops for heavier envelopes because the\nplanet swells up faster than the addition of envelope mass. Photoevaporation,\ntherefore, herds planets into either bare cores ~1.3 Rearth, or those with\ndouble the core's radius (~2.6 Rearth). This process mostly occurs during the\nfirst 100 Myrs when the stars' high energy flux are high and nearly constant.\nThe observed radius distribution further requires that the Kepler planets are\nclustered around 3 Mearth in mass, are born with H/He envelopes more than a few\npercent in mass, and that their cores are similar to the Earth in composition.\nSuch envelopes must have been accreted before the dispersal of the gas disks,\nwhile the core composition indicates formation inside the ice-line.

Non-convergence\npersists in SPH codes, although it is significantly mitigated with schemes\nhaving reduced artificial viscosity such as inviscid SPH (ISPH) (Cullen &\nDehnen 2010).

This has been well\nstudied using both linear theory and numerical simulations, but so far, only\nfor the primary spiral arm -- the one directly attached to the planet. Using\ntwo-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, we show that the secondary and\ntertiary arms driven by a planet can also open gaps as they steepen into\nshocks. The depths of the secondary/tertiary gaps in surface density grow with\ntime in a low viscosity disk ($\\alpha = 5\\times10^{-5}$), so even low-mass\nplanets (e.g., super-Earth or mini-Neptune-mass) embedded in the disk can open\nmultiple observable gaps, provided that sufficient time has passed. Applying\nour results to the HL Tau disk, we show that a single 30 Earth-mass planet\nembedded in the ring at 68.8~au (B5) can reasonably well reproduce the\npositions of the two major gaps at 13.2 and 32.3 au (D1 and D2), and roughly\nreproduce two other major gaps at 64.2 and 74.7 au (D5 and D6) seen in the mm\ncontinuum. The positions of secondary/tertiary gaps are found to be sensitive\nto the planetary mass and the disk temperature profile, so with accurate\nobservational measurements of the temperature structure the positions of\nmultiple gaps can be used to constrain the mass of the planet.

By using frequency analysis we\ndetermined the stability of the small moons and characterize, through diffusion\nmaps, the dynamical behavior of a wide region of geometric phase space, $a$ vs\n$e$, surrounding them. Those maps could shed light on the possible initial\nnumber of small bodies close to Mimas, and help to better understand the\ndynamical origin of the small satellites.

Here, we report the discovery of EPIC228754001.01, an inflated gas\ngiant planet found with the NASA K2 Mission, and a revised mass for another\ninflated planet, K2-97b. These planets reside on ~9 day orbits around host\nstars which recently evolved into red giants.

While in this state, appreciable angular momentum can\nbe transported. Alternatively, the gas may collapse into bound clumps, the\nprogenitors of planets or stars. In this paper, we numerically characterize the\nproperties of 3D gravitoturbulence, focussing especially on its dependence on\nnumerical parameters (resolution, domain size) and its excitation of\nsmall-scale dynamics. Via a survey of vertically stratified shearing box\nsimulations with PLUTO and RODEO, we find (a) evidence that certain\ngravitoturbulent properties are independent of horizontal box size only when\nthe box is larger than $\\simeq 40 H_0$, where $H_0$ is the height scale, (b) at\nhigh resolution, small-scale isotropic turbulence appears off the midplane\naround $z\\simeq 0.5 -1 H_0$, and (c) this small-scale dynamics results from a\nparametric instability, involving the coupling of inertial waves with a\nlarge-scale axisymmetric epicyclic mode.

We carry out a theoretical study on the\nlong-term evolution of inclined disks around eccentric binaries, calculating\nthe disk warp profile and dissipative torque acting on the disk. For disks with\naspect ratio $H/r$ larger than the viscosity parameter $\\alpha$, bending wave\npropagation effectively makes the disk precess as a quasi-rigid body, while\nviscosity acts on the disk warp and twist to drive secular evolution of the\ndisk-binary inclination.

When the disk has a non-negligible\nangular momentum compared to the binary, the final \"polar alignment\"\ninclination angle is reduced from $90^\\circ$. For typical protoplanetary disk\nparameters, the timescale of the inclination evolution is shorter than the disk\nlifetime, suggesting that highly-inclined disks and planets may exist orbiting\neccentric binaries. \n\n"}

At redshift z=0.031, Gaia17biu is also the lowest redshift\nSLSN-I to date, and the absence of a larger population of SLSNe-I in dwarf\ngalaxies of similar redshift suggests that metallicity is likely less important\nto the production of SLSNe-I than previously believed. With the smallest\ndistance and highest apparent brightness for an SLSN-I, we are able to study\nGaia17biu in unprecedented detail. Its pre-peak near-ultraviolet to optical\ncolor is similar to that of Gaia16apd and among the bluest observed for an\nSLSN-I while its peak luminosity (M_g = -21 mag) is substantially lower than\nGaia16apd.

Since its discovery in 2013, it\nhas experienced two outbursts, the second of which started in November 2014 and\nlasted until February 2017. We use high- and low-resolution spectroscopy and\ntime-resolved photometry from the ASAS-SN survey, the LCOGT and the Beacon\nObservatory to study the lightcurve and the dynamical and physical properties\nof the accretion flow. The 2014-2017 outburst lasted for nearly 800 days. A\n4.15d period in the lightcurve likely corresponds to rotational modulation of a\nstar with hot spot(s). The spectra show multiple emission lines with variable\ninverse P-Cygni profiles and a highly variable blueshifted absorption below the\ncontinuum. Line ratios from metallic emission lines (Fe I/Fe II, Ti I/Ti II)\nsuggest temperatures of $\\sim$5800-6000 K in the accretion flow.\nPhotometrically and spectroscopically, the 2014-2017 event displays an\nintermediate behavior between EXors and FUors. The accretion rate\n(\\.{M}=1-3$\\times$10$^{-7}$M$_\\odot$/yr), about 2 orders of magnitude higher\nthan the accretion rate in quiescence, is not significantly different from the\naccretion rate observed in 2013. The absorption features in the spectra suggest\nthat the system is viewed at a high angle and drives a powerful,\nnon-axisymmetric wind, maybe related to magnetic reconnection. The properties\nof ASASSN-13db suggest that temperatures lower than those for solar-type stars\nare needed for modeling accretion in very low-mass systems. Finally, the\nrotational modulation during the outburst reveals that accretion-related\nstructures settled after the begining of the outburst and can be relatively\nstable and long-lived.

Despite much theoretical/numerical and experimental\nefforts over the last decades, its saturation mechanism and amplitude, which\nsets the angular momentum transport rate, remains not well understood,\nespecially in the limit of high resistivity, or small magnetic Prandtl numbers\ntypical to interiors (dead zones) of protoplanetary disks, liquid cores of\nplanets and liquid metals in laboratory.

For simplicity, the ratio of azimuthal field to axial field is\nkept fixed. From the linear theory of HMRI, it is known that the Elsasser\nnumber, or interaction parameter determines its growth rate and plays a special\nrole in the dynamics. We show that this parameter is also important in the\nnonlinear problem.

We calculate the azimuthal\nand axial energy spectra corresponding to these two regimes and show that they\ndiffer qualitatively. Remarkably, the nonlinear state remains in all cases\nnearly axisymmetric suggesting that HMRI turbulence is quasi two-dimensional in\nnature.

With the intention of using CN as a diagnostic, we also address to\nwhich physical and chemical parameters CN is most sensitive. A set of disk\nmodels were run for different stellar spectra, masses, and physical structures\nvia the 2D thermochemical code DALI.

Ring-shaped emission is found\nto be a common feature of all adopted models; the highest abundance is found in\nthe upper outer regions of the disk, and the column density peaks at 30-100 AU\nfor T Tauri stars with standard accretion rates. Higher mass disks generally\nshow brighter CN. Higher UV fields, such as those appropriate for T Tauri stars\nwith high accretion rates or for Herbig Ae stars or for higher disk flaring,\ngenerally result in brighter and larger rings.

Here we compare the abundance ratios\nderived from UV lines probing T Tauri accretion streams to simple models of\ndisc evolution. Although the interpretation of line ratios in terms of\nabundances is highly uncertain, discs with large cavities in mm images tend to\nhave lower Si emission. Since this can naturally be explained by the suppressed\naccretion of dust, this suggests that abundance variations are at least\npartially responsible for the variations seen in the line ratios.

It is known that in general-sum games reactive training can lead\ngroups of agents to converge to inefficient outcomes. We focus on one such\nclass of environments: Stag Hunt games.

Giant planets are generally\nbelieved to form far from their host stars, where volatile materials like water\nexist in their solid phase, making it easier for giant planet cores to\naccumulate. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain how giant planets\ncan migrate inward from their birth sites to short-period orbits. One such\nmechanism, called Kozai-Lidov migration, requires the presence of distant\ncompanions in orbits inclined by more than $\\sim40$ degrees with respect to the\nplane of the hot Jupiter's orbit. The high occurrence rate of wide companions\nin hot Jupiter systems lends support to this theory for migration. However, the\nexact orbital inclinations of these detected planetary and stellar companions\nis not known, so it is not clear whether the mutual inclination of these\ncompanions is large enough for the Kozai-Lidov process to operate. This paper\nshows that in systems orbiting cool stars with convective outer layers, the\norbits of most wide planetary companions to hot Jupiters must be well aligned\nwith the orbits of the hot Jupiters and the spins of the host stars. For a\nvariety of possible distributions for the inclination of the companion, the\nwidth of the distribution must be less than $\\sim20$ degrees to recreate the\nobservations with good fidelity. As a result, the companion orbits are likely\nwell-aligned with those of the hot Jupiters, and the Kozai-Lidov mechanism does\nnot enforce migration in these systems. \n\n"}

Phase curves of the\nplanets in thermal emission provide clues to this question, because a\nsubstantial atmosphere would transport heat more efficiently than a bare-rock\nsurface. Analyzing phase curve photometric data around secondary eclipse has\npreviously been used to study energy transport in the atmospheres of hot\nJupiters. Here we use phase curve, Spitzer time-series photometry to study the\nthermal emission properties of the super-Earth exoplanet 55 Cancri e. We\nutilize a semi-analytical framework to fit a physical model to the infrared\nphotometric data at 4.5 micron. The model uses parameters of planetary\nproperties including Bond albedo, heat redistribution efficiency (i.e., ratio\nbetween radiative timescale and advective timescale of the atmosphere), and\natmospheric greenhouse factor. The phase curve of 55 Cancri e is dominated by\nthermal emission with an eastward-shifted hot spot. We determine the heat\nredistribution efficiency to be ~1.47, which implies that the advective\ntimescale is on the same order as the radiative timescale. This requirement\ncannot be met by the bare-rock planet scenario because heat transport by\ncurrents of molten lava would be too slow. The phase curve thus favors the\nscenario with a substantial atmosphere. Our constraints on the heat\nredistribution efficiency translate to an atmospheric pressure of ~1.4 bar.

However, the turbulent properties of protoplanetary disks\nare poorly constrained observationally. Recent studies have found turbulent\nspeeds smaller than what fully-developed MRI would produce (Flaherty et al.\n2015, 2017). However, existing studies assumed a constant CO/H2 ratio of 0.0001\nin locations where CO is not frozen-out or photo-dissociated. Our previous\nstudies of evolving disk chemistry indicate that CO is depleted by\nincorporation into complex organic molecules well inside the freeze-out radius\nof CO. We consider the effects of this chemical depletion on measurements of\nturbulence. Simon et al. (2015) suggested that the ratio of the peak line flux\nto the flux at line center of the CO J=3-2 transition is a reasonable\ndiagnostic of turbulence, so we focus on that metric, while adding some\nanalysis of the more complex effects on spatial distribution. We simulate the\nemission lines of CO based on chemical evolution models presented in Yu et al.\n(2016), and find that the peak-to-trough ratio changes as a function of time as\nCO is destroyed. Specifically, a CO-depleted disk with high turbulent velocity\nmimics the peak-to-trough ratios of a non-CO-depleted disk with lower turbulent\nvelocity. We suggest that disk observers and modelers take into account the\npossibility of CO depletion when using line peak-to-trough ratios to constrain\nthe degree of turbulence in disks. Assuming that CO/H2 = 0.0001 at all disk\nradii can lead to underestimates of turbulent speeds in the disk by at least\n0.2 km/s. \n\n"}

However, in spite of several claims, conclusive evidence is still\nlacking. We estimate the magnetic energy available in the interaction using\nanalytical models to provide an upper bound to the expected flare energy. We\ninvestigate three different mechanisms leading to magnetic energy release. The\nfirst two can release an energy up to $(0.2-1.2) B^{2}_{0} R^{3}/\\mu$, where\n$B_{0}$ is the surface field of the star, $R$ its radius, and $\\mu$ the\nmagnetic permeability of the plasma. They operate in young active stars whose\ncoronae have closed magnetic field lines up to the distance of their close-by\nplanets that can trigger the energy release. The third mechanism operates in\nweakly or moderately active stars having a coronal field with predominantly\nopen field lines at the distance of their planets. The released energy is of\nthe order of $(0.002-0.1) B^{2}_{0} R^{3}/\\mu$ and depends on the ratio of the\nplanetary to the stellar fields, thus allowing an indirect measurement of the\nformer when the latter is known. We compute the released energy for different\nseparations of the planet and different stellar parameters finding the\nconditions for the operation of the proposed mechanisms. An application to\neight selected systems is presented. The computed energies and dissipation\ntimescales are in agreement with flare observations in the eccentric system HD\n17156 and in the circular systems HD 189733 and HD 179949.

If these discs are prone to\nfragmentation, then they are able to rapidly form objects that are initially of\nseveral Jupiter masses and larger. The fate of these disc fragments (and the\nfate of planetary bodies formed afterwards via core accretion) depends\nsensitively not only on the fragment's interaction with the disc, but with its\nneighbouring fragments.\n  We return to and revise our population synthesis model of self-gravitating\ndisc fragmentation and tidal downsizing. Amongst other improvements, the model\nnow directly incorporates fragment-fragment interactions while the disc is\nstill present. We find that fragment-fragment scattering dominates the orbital\nevolution, even when we enforce rapid migration and inefficient gap formation.\n  Compared to our previous model, we see a small increase in the number of\nterrestrial-type objects being formed, although their survival under tidal\nevolution is at best unclear.

In addition, an effective surface can be imposed by refraction, thereby\nlimiting the pressure levels probed by transmission spectroscopy. The main\nobjective of the paper is to model the effects of refraction on photometric\nlight curves for realistic planets and to explore the dependencies on\natmospheric physical parameters. We also explore under which circumstances\ntransmission spectra are significantly affected by refraction. Finally, we\nsearch for refraction signatures in photometric residuals in Kepler data. We\nuse the model of Hui & Seager (2002) to compute deflection angles and\nrefraction transit light curves, allowing us to explore the parameter space of\natmospheric properties. The observational search is performed by stacking large\nsamples of transit light curves from Kepler.

Specifically, we compare the actual possible atmospheres to\na threshold thickness above which a primordial (H$_2$-dominated) atmosphere can\nbe retained against evaporation over the planet's lifetime. The best\nconstrained parameters are the individual layer thicknesses. The maximum radius\nfraction of possible atmospheres are 0.18 and 0.13 $R$ (radius), for planets b\nand c, respectively.

Formation\n  mechanism Abstract: Protoplanetary disk simulations show that a single planet can excite more\nthan one spiral arm, possibly explaining recent observations of multiple spiral\narms in some systems. In this paper, we explain the mechanism by which a planet\nexcites multiple spiral arms in a protoplanetary disk. Contrary to previous\nspeculations, the formation of both primary and additional arms can be\nunderstood as a linear process when the planet mass is sufficiently small. A\nplanet resonantly interacts with epicyclic oscillations in the disk, launching\nspiral wave modes around the Lindblad resonances. When a set of wave modes is\nin phase, they can constructively interfere with each other and create a spiral\narm. More than one spiral arm can form because such constructive interference\ncan occur for different sets of wave modes, with the exact number and launching\nposition of spiral arms dependent on the planet mass as well as the disk\ntemperature profile. Non-linear effects become increasingly important as the\nplanet mass increases, resulting in spiral arms with stronger shocks and thus\nlarger pitch angles. This is found in common for both primary and additional\narms. When a planet has a sufficiently large mass ($\\gtrsim$ 3 thermal masses\nfor $(h/r)_p=0.1$), only two spiral arms form interior to its orbit.

Tidal effects are\nenhanced by crustal thinning at the south pole, so that realistic models of\ntidal tectonics and dissipation should take into account the lateral variations\nof shell structure. I construct here the theory of non-uniform viscoelastic\nthin shells, allowing for depth-dependent rheology and large lateral variations\nof shell thickness and rheology. Coupling to tides yields two 2D linear partial\ndifferential equations of the 4th order on the sphere which take into account\nself-gravity, density stratification below the shell, and core viscoelasticity.\nIf the shell is laterally uniform, the solution agrees with analytical formulas\nfor tidal Love numbers; errors on displacements and stresses are less than 5%\nand 15%, respectively, if the thickness is less than 10% of the radius. If the\nshell is non-uniform, the tidal thin shell equations are solved as a system of\ncoupled linear equations in a spherical harmonic basis.

In addition to the transit features created by\nthe planets, the flux also includes the reflected light component of each\nplanet, which depends on the planetary albedo. This signal is typically\nreferred to as phase curve and could be easily identified if there were no\nadditional noise. As well as instrumental noise, stellar activity, such as\nspots, can create a modulation in the data, which may be very difficult to\ndistinguish from the planetary signal. We analyze the limitations imposed by\nthe stellar activity on the detection of the planetary albedo, considering the\nlimitations imposed by the predicted level of instrumental noise and the short\nduration of the observations planned in the context of the CHEOPS mission. As\ninitial condition, we have assumed that each star is characterized by just one\norbiting planet. We built mock light curves that included a realistic stellar\nactivity pattern, the reflected light component of the planet and an\ninstrumental noise level, which we have chosen to be at the same level as\npredicted for CHEOPS. We then fit these light curves to try to recover the\nreflected light component, assuming the activity patterns can be modeled with a\nGaussian process.We estimate that at least one full stellar rotation is\nnecessary to obtain a reliable detection of the planetary albedo. This result\nis independent of the level of noise, but it depends on the limitation of the\nGaussian process to describe the stellar activity when the light curve\ntime-span is shorter than the stellar rotation. Finally, in presence of typical\nCHEOPS gaps in the simulations, we confirm that it is still possible to obtain\na reliable albedo. \n\n"}

Model description and first results Abstract: Recently, properties of exoplanet atmospheres have been constrained via\nmulti-wavelength transit observation, which measures an apparent decrease in\nstellar brightness during planetary transit in front of its host star (called\ntransit depth). Sets of transit depths so far measured at different wavelengths\n(called transmission spectra) are somewhat diverse: Some show steep spectral\nslope features in the visible, some contain featureless spectra in the\nnear-infrared, some show distinct features from radiative absorption by gaseous\nspecies. These facts infer the existence of haze in the atmospheres especially\nof warm, relatively low-density super-Earths and mini-Neptunes. Previous\nstudies that addressed theoretical modeling of transmission spectra of\nhydrogen-dominated atmospheres with haze used some assumed distribution and\nsize of haze particles. In this study, we model the atmospheric chemistry,\nderive the spatial and size distributions of haze particles by simulating the\ncreation, growth and settling of hydrocarbon haze particles directly, and\ndevelop transmission spectrum models of UV-irradiated, solar-abundance\natmospheres of close-in warm ($\\sim$ 500 K) exoplanets.

Metal-rich Stars Host a Greater\n  Diversity of Planets Abstract: Probing the connection between a star's metallicity and the presence and\nproperties of any associated planets offers an observational link between\nconditions during the epoch of planet formation and mature planetary systems.\nWe explore this connection by analyzing the metallicities of Kepler target\nstars and the subset of stars found to host transiting planets. After\ncorrecting for survey incompleteness, we measure planet occurrence: the number\nof planets per 100 stars with a given metallicity $M$. Planet occurrence\ncorrelates with metallicity for some, but not all, planet sizes and orbital\nperiods. For warm super-Earths having $P = 10-100$ days and $R_P =\n1.0-1.7~R_E$, planet occurrence is nearly constant over metallicities spanning\n$-$0.4 dex to +0.4 dex. We find 20 warm super-Earths per 100 stars, regardless\nof metallicity. In contrast, the occurrence of warm sub-Neptunes ($R_P =\n1.7-4.0~R_E$) doubles over that same metallicity interval, from 20 to 40\nplanets per 100 stars. We model the distribution of planets as $d f \\propto\n10^{\\beta M} d M$, where $\\beta$ characterizes the strength of any metallicity\ncorrelation. This correlation steepens with decreasing orbital period and\nincreasing planet size. For warm super-Earths $\\beta = -0.3^{+0.2}_{-0.2}$,\nwhile for hot Jupiters $\\beta = +3.4^{+0.9}_{-0.8}$. High metallicities in\nprotoplanetary disks may increase the mass of the largest rocky cores or the\nspeed at which they are assembled, enhancing the production of planets larger\nthan 1.7 $R_E$.

To use these intervals\n(called windows) a good knowledge of atmospheric absorption is necessary.

This discrepancy is\ngenerally treated with a workaround which consists in using a different cut-off\ndescription for this specific window.

Thus, a\ngood knowledge of atmosphere opacities is essential and our scope is to better\nunderstand what causes the difference between the 2 {\\mu}m window and the other\nwindows.

Very metal-poor regions of the Galaxy, or those\nlargely devoid of atoms more massive than H and He, are thought to be unable to\nform habitable planets. Moreover, if such planets do form, the young system is\nsubjected to close stellar passages while it resides in its stellar birth\ncluster. Various potential hazards remain after clusters disperse. For\ninstance, central galactic regions may present risks to habitability via nearby\nsupernovae, gamma ray bursts (GRBs), and frequent comet showers. In addition,\nplanets residing within very wide binary star systems are affected by the\nGalaxy, as local gravitational perturbations from the Galaxy can increase the\nbinary's eccentricity until it destabilizes the planets it hosts. Here we\nreview the most recent work on the main galactic influences over planetary\nhabitability. Although there must be some metallicity limit below which rocky\nplanets cannot form, recent exoplanet surveys show that they form around stars\nwith a very large range of metallicities. Once formed, the probability of star\nclusters destabilizing planetary systems only becomes high for rare, extremely\nlong-lived clusters.

This is important for planetary habitability\nbecause snowball events may trigger rises in the complexity of life, but could\nalso endanger complex life that already exists. Recent work has shown that\nplanets tidally locked in synchronous rotation states will transition smoothly\ninto the snowball state rather than experiencing bifurcations. Here we\ninvestigate the structure of snowball bifurcations on planets that are tidally\ninfluenced, but not synchronously rotating, so that they experience long solar\ndays. We use PlaSIM, an intermediate-complexity global climate model, with a\nthermodynamic mixed layer ocean and the Sun's spectrum. We find that the amount\nof hysteresis (range in stellar flux for which there is bistability in climate)\nis significantly reduced for solar days with lengths of tens of Earth days, and\ndisappears for solar days of hundreds of Earth days. These results suggest that\ntidally influenced planets orbiting M and K-stars that are not synchronously\nrotating could have much less hysteresis associated with the snowball\nbifurcations than they would if they were rapidly rotating. This implies that\nthe amount of time it takes them to escape a snowball state via CO$_2$\noutgassing would be greatly reduced, as would the period of cycling between the\nwarm and snowball state if they have a low CO$_2$ outgassing rate. \n\n"}

The complexity of the TTV inversion problem is known to be particularly\nacute in multi-planetary systems (convergence issues, degeneracies and size of\nthe parameter space), especially for resonant chain systems such as TRAPPIST-1.\nMethods. To overcome these challenges, we have used a novel method that employs\na genetic algorithm coupled to a full N-body integrator that we applied to a\nset of 284 individual transit timings.

We aimed\nto construct a 3-dimensional model of HD 163296 capable of reproducing\nsimultaneously new observations of the disk surface in scattered light with the\nSPHERE instrument and thermal emission continuum observations of the disk\nmidplane with ALMA. We want to determine why the SED of HD 163296 is\nintermediary between the otherwise well-separated group I and group II Herbig\nstars. Methods. The disk was modelled using the Monte Carlo radiative transfer\ncode MCMax3D. The radial dust surface density profile was modelled after the\nALMA observations, while the polarized scattered light observations were used\nto constrain the inclination of the inner disk component and turbulence and\ngrain growth in the outer disk. Results. While three rings are observed in the\ndisk midplane in millimeter thermal emission at $\\sim$80, 124 and 200 AU, only\nthe innermost of these is observed in polarized scattered light, indicating a\nlack of small dust grains on the surface of the outer disk. We provide two\nmodels capable of explaining this difference. The first model uses increased\nsettling in the outer disk as a mechanism to bring the small dust grains on the\nsurface of the disk closer to the midplane, and into the shadow cast by the\nfirst ring. The second model uses depletion of the smallest dust grains in the\nouter disk as a mechanism for decreasing the optical depth at optical and NIR\nwavelengths.

Abstract: In the present paper, we model the wind of solar analogues at different ages\nto investigate the evolution of the solar wind. Recently, it has been suggested\nthat winds of solar type stars might undergo a change in properties at old\nages, whereby stars older than the Sun would be less efficient in carrying away\nangular momentum than what was traditionally believed. Adding to this, recent\nobservations suggest that old solar-type stars show a break in coronal\nproperties, with a steeper decay in X-ray luminosities and temperatures at\nolder ages. We use these X-ray observations to constrain the thermal\nacceleration of winds of solar analogues. Our sample is based on the stars from\nthe `Sun in time' project with ages between 120-7000 Myr. The break in X-ray\nproperties leads to a break in wind mass-loss rates ($\\dot{M}$) at roughly 2\nGyr, with $\\dot{M}$ (t < 2 Gyr) $\\propto t^{-0.74}$ and $\\dot{M}$ (t > 2 Gyr)\n$\\propto$ $t^{-3.9}$. This steep decay in $\\dot{M}$ at older ages could be the\nreason why older stars are less efficient at carrying away angular momentum,\nwhich would explain the anomalously rapid rotation observed in older stars. We\nalso show that none of the stars in our sample would have winds dense enough to\nproduce thermal emission above 1-2 GHz, explaining why their radio emissions\nhave not yet been detected. Combining our models with dynamo evolution models\nfor the magnetic field of the Earth we find that, at early ages ($\\approx$100\nMyr) our Earth had a magnetosphere that was 3 or more times smaller than its\ncurrent size. \n\n"}

Proposed explanations\nfor the high SLR abundance include formation of the Sun in a\nsupernova-triggered collapse or in a giant molecular cloud (GMC) that was\nmassive enough to survive multiple supernovae (SNe) and confine their ejecta.\nHowever, the former scenario is possible only if the Sun is a rare outlier\namong massive stars, while the latter appears to be inconsistent with the\nobservation that 26Al is distributed with a scale height significantly larger\nthan GMCs. In this paper, we present a high-resolution chemo-hydrodynamical\nsimulation of the entire Milky-Way Galaxy, including stochastic star formation,\nHII regions, SNe, and element injection, that allows us to measure for the\ndistribution of 60Fe/56Fe and 26Al/27Al ratios over all stars in the Galaxy.

Instead, we find that SLRs are\nabundant in newborn stars because star formation is correlated on galactic\nscales, so that ejecta preferentially enrich atomic gas that will subsequently\nbe accreted onto existing GMCs or will form new ones. Thus new generations of\nstars preferentially form in patches of the Galaxy contaminated by previous\ngenerations of stellar winds and supernovae. \n\n"}

In addition epoch\nastrometry and photometry are provided for a modest sample of minor planets in\nthe solar system.\n  A summary of the contents of Gaia DR2 is presented, accompanied by a\ndiscussion on the differences with respect to Gaia DR1 and an overview of the\nmain limitations which are still present in the survey.

Positions are provided for each Gaia\nobservation at CCD level. As additional information, the apparent brightness of\nSSOs in the unfiltered G band is also provided for selected observations. We\nexplain the processing of SSO data, and describe the criteria we used to select\nthe sample published in Gaia DR2. We then explore the data set to assess its\nquality. To exploit the epoch astrometry of asteroids in Gaia DR2 it is\nnecessary to take into account the unusual properties of the uncertainty, as\nthe position information is nearly one-dimensional. When this aspect is handled\nappropriately, an orbit fit can be obtained with post-fit residuals that are\noverall consistent with the a-priori error model that was used to define\nindividual values of the astrometric uncertainty. The distribution of residuals\nallowed us to identify possible contaminants in the data set. Photometry in the\nG band was compared to computed values from reference asteroid shapes and to\nthe flux registered at the corresponding epochs by the red and blue photometers\n(RP and BP). The overall astrometric performance is close to the expectations,\nwith an optimal range of brightness G~12-17. In this range, the typical\ntransit-level accuracy is well below 1 mas. For fainter asteroids, the growing\nphoton noise deteriorates the performance. Asteroids brighter than G~12 are\naffected by a lower performance of the processing of their signals. The\ndramatic improvement brought by Gaia DR2 astrometry of SSOs is demonstrated by\npreliminary tests on the detection of subtle non-gravitational effects. \n\n"}

Giant planets occur more\nfrequently around more metal-rich and more massive stars. These findings\nsupport the core accretion theory of planet formation, in which the cores of\ngiant planets form more rapidly in more solid-rich and more gas-rich\nprotoplanetary disks. Smaller planets, those with sizes roughly between Earth\nand Neptune, exhibit different scaling relations with stellar properties. These\nplanets orbit stars with a range of metallicities and occur more frequently\naround lower mass stars, indicating that planet formation takes place in a wide\nrange of environments. Within M dwarfs, both radial velocity and transit\nsurveys show that planets are smaller and located closer to the star when the\nstellar mass is lower.

This led previous authors to\npuzzling conclusions about the thermal structures and chemical abundances of\nthese planets. Using the SPARC/MITgcm, we investigate how thermal dissociation,\nionization, H$^-$ opacity and clouds shape the thermal structures and spectral\nproperties of ultra hot Jupiters with a special focus on WASP-121b. We expand\nour findings to the whole population of ultra hot Jupiters through analytical\nquantification of the thermal dissociation and its influence on the strength of\nspectral features.\n  We predict that most molecules are thermally dissociated and alkalies are\nionized in the dayside photospheres of ultra hot Jupiters. This includes\nH$_{\\rm 2}$O, TiO, VO, and H$_{\\rm 2}$ but not CO, which has a stronger\nmolecular bond. The vertical molecular gradient created by the dissociation\nsignificantly weakens the spectral features from water while the $4.5\\mu m$ CO\nfeature remain unchanged. The water band in the HST/WFC3 bandpass is further\nweakened by H$^-$ continuum opacity. Molecules are expected to recombine before\nreaching the limb, leading to order of magnitude variations of the chemical\ncomposition and cloud coverage between the limb and the dayside. Overall,\nmolecular dissociation provides a qualitative understanding of the lack of\nstrong spectral feature of water in the $1-2\\mu m$ bandpass observed in most\nultra hot Jupiters. Quantitatively, however, our model does not provide a\nsatisfactory match to the WASP-121b emission spectrum. Together with WASP-33b\nand Kepler-33Ab, they seem the outliers among the population of ultra hot\nJupiters in need of a more thorough understanding. \n\n"}

Previously, we measured stellar radii to 11%\nprecision using high-resolution spectroscopy; by adding Gaia astrometry, the\nerrors are now 2%.

Two other important factors that sculpt the distribution are a\nplanet's orbital distance and its host star mass, both of which are related to\na planet's X-ray/UV irradiation history.

The\npredicted size distributions are frequently bimodal and irregular in shape.\nThere is a negative correlation between total cloud mass and equilibrium\ntemperature as well as a positive correlation between total cloud mass and\natmospheric mixing. The cloud properties on the east and west limbs show\ndistinct differences that increase with increasing equilibrium temperature.\nCloud opacities are roughly constant across a broad wavelength range with the\nexception of features in the mid-infrared.

Using the fully resolved size\ndistribution of cloud particles as opposed to a mean particle size has a\ndistinct impact on the resultant cloud opacities.

This has led to a perceived dearth of dusty\nsystems at $z>4$, and the conclusion, according to some models, that the early\nUniverse was relatively dust-poor. In this paper, we extend the backward\nevolution galaxy model described by Casey et al.

Previous\nefforts have either adopted spherical harmonics, or various ad hoc map\nparameterizations, none of which produce orthogonal lightcurves. We use\nprincipal component analysis to construct orthogonal \"eigencurves,\" which we\nthen use to fit published 8 micron observations of the hot Jupiter HD 189733b.\nThis approach has a few advantages over previously used techniques: 1) the\nlightcurves can be pre-computed, accelerating the fitting process, 2) the\neigencurves are orthogonal to each other, reducing parameter correlations, and\n3) the eigencurves are model-independent and are ranked in order of\nsensitivity.

We combine observations and\nchemical models to constrain the sulfur abundances and their sensitivity to\nphysical and chemical conditions in the DM Tau protoplanetary disk. Methods. We\nobtained $0.5^{\"}$ ALMA observations of DM Tau in Bands 4 and 6 in lines of CS,\nSO, SO$_2$, OCS, CCS, H$_2$CS and H$_2$S, achieving a $\\sim 5$ mJy sensitivity.\nUsing the non-LTE radiative transfer code RADEX and the forward-modeling tool\nDiskFit, disk-averaged CS column densities and upper limits for the other\nspecies were derived. Results. Only CS was detected with a derived column\ndensity of $\\sim 2-6 \\times 10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$. We report a first tentative\ndetection of SO$_2$ in DM Tau. The upper limits range between $\\sim 10^{11}$\nand $10^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$ for the other S-bearing species. The best-fit chemical\nmodel matching these values requires a gas-phase C/O ratio of > 1 at $r \\sim\n50-100$ au. With chemical modeling we demonstrate that sulfur-bearing species\ncould be robust tracers of the gas-phase C/O ratio, surface reaction rates,\ngrain size and UV intensities. Conclusions. The lack of detections of a variety\nof sulfur-bearing molecules in DM Tau other than CS implies a dearth of\nreactive sulfur in the gas phase, either through efficient freeze-out or\nbecause most of the elemental sulfur is in other large species, as found in\ncomets. The inferred high CS/SO and CS/SO$_2$ ratios require a non-solar C/O\ngas-phase ratio of > 1, consistent with the recent observations of hydrocarbon\nrings in DM Tau. The stronger depletion of oxygen-bearing S-species compared to\nCS is likely linked to the low observed abundances of gaseous water in DM Tau\nand points to a removal mechanism of oxygen from the gas. \n\n"}

However, the satellitesimal formation itself\nposes a nontrivial problem as the dust evolution in the circumplanetary disk is\nheavily impacted by fast radial drift and thus dust growth to satellitesimals\nis hindered.

We\npresent the first results of our HARPS long-term radial velocity (RV) survey\nwhich aims to discover exoplanets around intermediate-mass (between ~ 2 and 6\nMsun) evolved stars in open clusters. We selected 826 bona fide HARPS\nobservations of 114 giants from an initial list of 29 open clusters and\ncomputed the half peak-to-peak variability of the HARPS RV measurements, namely\nDeltaRV/2, for each target, to search for the best planet-host candidates. We\nalso performed time series analysis for a few targets with enough observations\nto search for orbital solutions. Although we attempted to rule out the presence\nof binaries on the basis of previous surveys, we detected 14 new binary\ncandidates in our sample, most of them identified from a comparison between\nHARPS and CORAVEL data. We also suggest 11 new planet-host candidates based on\na relation between the stellar surface gravity and DeltaRV/2.

This paper focuses on the mid-IR\nspectral region between 9.7 um to 40 um for T Tauri stars. The generated\nspectra contain several tens of thousands of molecular emission lines of H2O,\nOH, CO, CO2, HCN, C2H2, H2 and a few other molecules, as well as the forbidden\natomic emission lines of SI, SII, SIII, SiII, FeII, NeII, NeIII, ArII and\nArIII. In contrast to previously published works, we do not treat the\nabundances of the molecules nor the temperature in the disc as free parameters,\nbut use the complex results of detailed 2D ProDiMo disc models concerning gas\nand dust temperature structure, and molecular concentrations. FLiTs computes\nthe line emission spectra by ray tracing in an efficient, fast and reliable\nway. The results are broadly consistent with R=600 Spitzer/IRS observational\ndata of T Tauri stars concerning line strengths, colour, and line ratios. In\norder to achieve that agreement, however, we need to assume either a high\ngas/dust mass ratio of order 1000, or the presence of illuminated disc walls at\ndistances of a few au. The molecules in these walls cannot be photo-dissociated\neasily by UV because of the large densities in the walls which favour their\nre-formation. Most observable molecular emission lines are found to be\noptically thick, rendering a standard analysis with column densities difficult.\nWe find that the difference between gas and dust temperatures in the disc\nsurface is important for the line formation. We briefly discuss the effects of\nC/O ratio and choice of chemical rate network on these results. Our analysis\noffers new ways to infer the chemical and temperature structure of T Tauri\ndiscs from future JWST/MIRI observations, and to possibly detect secondary\nilluminated disc walls based on their specific mid-IR molecular signature. \n\n"}

Exomoons will contribute to exoplanetary signals but are virtually\nundetectable with current methods. Aims: We identify and analyse traces of\nexomoons in the temporal variation of total and polarised fluxes of starlight\nreflected by an Earth-like exoplanet and its spatially unresolved moon across\nall phase angles, with both orbits viewed in an edge-on geometry. Methods: We\ncompute the total and linearly polarised fluxes, and the degree of linear\npolarization P of starlight that is reflected by the exoplanet with its moon\nalong their orbits, accounting for the temporal variation of the visibility of\nthe planetary and lunar disks, and including effects of mutual transits and\nmutual eclipses. Our computations pertain to a wavelength of 450 nm. Results:\nTotal flux F shows regular dips due to planetary and lunar transits and\neclipses. Polarization P shows regular peaks due to planetary transits and\nlunar eclipses, and P can increase and/or slightly decrease during lunar\ntransits and planetary eclipses. Changes in F and P will depend on the radii of\nthe planet and moon, on their reflective properties, and their orbits, and are\nabout one magnitude smaller than the smooth background signals.

The proximity of the planets\nto their host star implies a high flux of incident stellar wind particles, thus\nthe sputtering process is sufficiently effective to build up relatively dense,\nrefractory-rich exospheres. The sputtering releases refractory elements from\nthe entire dayside surfaces of the planets, with elements such as O and Mg\ncreating an extended neutral exosphere with densities larger than 10/cm3,\nextending to several planetary radii.

For a planet massive enough to carve a gap, the disc is\nseparated into two components and the gas interior and exterior to the planet\norbit evolve separately, forming an inner and outer disc. Due to the\ninclination of the planet, a warp develops across the planet orbit such that\nthere is a relative tilt and twist between these discs. We show that when other\nparameters are held constant, the relative inclination that develops between\nthe inner and outer disc depends on the outer radius of the total disc\nmodelled. For a given disc mass, our results suggest that the observational\nrelevance of the warp depends more strongly on the mass of the planet rather\nthan the inclination of the orbit. \n\n"}

It is hypothesized that the dust is produced via\ncollisions associated with an evolving dust disk, temporarily increasing the\nemitting surface of warm debris, and is subsequently destroyed or assimilated\nwithin a few years.

We recently devised a new method to analyse\nIFU data, called molecule mapping, searching for high-frequency signatures of\nparticular molecules in an IFU data cube.\n  Aims. The aim of this paper is to use the molecule mapping technique to\nsearch for the previously detected spectral signatures in HR8799b using the\nsame data, allowing a comparison of molecule mapping with previous methods.\n  Methods. The medium-resolution H- and K-band pipeline-reduced archival data\nwere retrieved from the Keck archive facility. Telluric and stellar lines were\nremoved from each spectrum in the data cube, after which the residuals were\ncross-correlated with model spectra of carbon monoxide, water, and methane.\n  Results. Both carbon monoxide and water are clearly detected at high\nsignal-to-noise, however, methane is not retrieved.\n  Conclusions. Molecule mapping works very well on the OSIRIS data of exoplanet\nHR8799b. However, it is not evident why methane is detected in the original\nanalysis, but not with the molecule mapping technique. Possible causes could be\nthe presence of telluric residuals, different spectral filtering techniques, or\nthe use of different methane models. We do note that in the original analysis\nmethane was only detected in the K-band, while the H-band methane signal could\nbe expected to be comparably strong.

Commonly, planetary\nevolution models employ simple analytic formulae (e.g., energy limited escape)\nthat are often inaccurate, and more detailed physical models of atmospheric\nloss usually only give snapshots of an atmosphere's structure and are difficult\nto use for evolutionary studies.

Giant impacts are expected to play a role in the\nformation of many of these worlds. Previous works, focused on the mechanical\nshock caused by a giant impact, have shown that these impacts can eject large\nfractions of the planetary envelope, offering a partial explanation for the\nobserved spread in exoplanet compositions. Here, we examine the thermal\nconsequences of giant impacts, and show that the atmospheric loss caused by\nthese effects can significantly exceed that caused by mechanical shocks for\nhydrogen-helium (H/He) envelopes. When a giant impact occurs, part of the\nimpact energy is converted into thermal energy, heating the rocky core and the\nenvelope. We find that the ensuing thermal expansion of the envelope can lead\nto a period of sustained, rapid mass loss through a Parker wind, resulting in\nthe partial or complete erosion of the H/He envelope. The fraction of the\nenvelope lost depends on the planet's orbital distance from its host star and\nits initial thermal state, and hence age. Planets closer to their host stars\nare more susceptible to thermal atmospheric loss triggered by impacts than ones\non wider orbits. Similarly, younger planets, with rocky cores which are still\nhot and molten from formation, suffer greater atmospheric loss. This is\nespecially interesting because giant impacts are expected to occur\n$10{-}100~\\mathrm{Myr}$ after formation.

Using social dilemmas as the training ground, we present a\nnovel learning architecture, Learning through Probing (LTP), where agents\nutilize a probing mechanism to incorporate how their opponent's behavior\nchanges when an agent takes an action. We use distinct training phases and\nadjust rewards according to the overall outcome of the experiences accounting\nfor changes to the opponents behavior. We introduce a parameter eta to\ndetermine the significance of these future changes to opponent behavior. When\napplied to the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD), LTP agents demonstrate that\nthey can learn to cooperate with each other, achieving higher average\ncumulative rewards than other reinforcement learning methods while also\nmaintaining good performance in playing against static agents that are present\nin Axelrod tournaments. We compare this method with traditional reinforcement\nlearning algorithms and agent-tracking techniques to highlight key differences\nand potential applications. We also draw attention to the differences between\nsolving games and societal-like interactions and analyze the training of\nQ-learning agents in makeshift societies. This is to emphasize how cooperation\nmay emerge in societies and demonstrate this using environments where\ninteractions with opponents are determined through a random encounter format of\nthe IPD. \n\n"}

Here\nwe extend these 2D simulations to three dimensions (3D) and find that rings and\ngaps are still formed in the presence of a moderately strong ambipolar\ndiffusion. The rings and gaps form from the same basic mechanism that was\nidentified in the 2D simulations, namely, the redistribution of the poloidal\nmagnetic flux relative to the disk material as a result of the reconnection of\na sharply pinched poloidal magnetic field lines. Thus, the less dense gaps are\nmore strongly magnetized with a large poloidal magnetic field compared to the\nless magnetized (dense) rings. The rings and gaps start out rather smoothly in\n3D simulations that have axisymmetric initial conditions. Non-axisymmetric\nvariations arise spontaneously at later times, but they do not grow to such an\nextent as to disrupt the rings and gaps. These disk substructures persist to\nthe end of the simulations, lasting up to 3000 orbital periods at the inner\nedge of the simulated disk. The longevity of the perturbed yet still coherent\nrings make them attractive sites for trapping large grains that would otherwise\nbe lost to rapid radial migration due to gas drag. As the ambipolar diffusivity\ndecreases, both the disk and the wind become increasingly turbulent, driven by\nthe magnetorotational instability, with tightly-wound spiral arms becoming more\nprominent in the disk. \n\n"}

We classified 58 disks with available\npolarimetric observations into six major categories (Ring, Spiral, Giant, Rim,\nFaint, and Small disks) based on their appearance in scattered light. We\nre-calculated the stellar and disk properties from the newly available GAIA DR2\nand related these properties with the disk categories. More than a half of our\nsample shows disk sub-structures. For the remaining sources, the absence of\ndetected features is due to their faintness, to their small size, or to the\ndisk geometry. Faint disks are typically found around young stars and typically\nhost no cavity. There is a possible dichotomy in the near-IR excess of sources\nwith spiral-disks (high) and ring-disks (low). Like spirals, shadows are\nassociated with a high near-IR excess. If we account for the pre-main sequence\nevolutionary timescale of stars with different mass, spiral arms are likely\nassociated to old disks. We also found a loose, shallow declining trend for the\ndisk dust mass with time.

Since agents an\nindependently agree on their common knowledge, they can execute complex\ncoordinated policies that condition on this knowledge in a fully decentralised\nfashion. We propose multi-agent common knowledge reinforcement learning\n(MACKRL), a novel stochastic actor-critic algorithm that learns a hierarchical\npolicy tree. Higher levels in the hierarchy coordinate groups of agents by\nconditioning on their common knowledge, or delegate to lower levels with\nsmaller subgroups but potentially richer common knowledge. The entire policy\ntree can be executed in a fully decentralised fashion. As the lowest policy\ntree level consists of independent policies for each agent, MACKRL reduces to\nindependently learnt decentralised policies as a special case. We demonstrate\nthat our method can exploit common knowledge for superior performance on\ncomplex decentralised coordination tasks, including a stochastic matrix game\nand challenging problems in StarCraft II unit micromanagement. \n\n"}

In dense magnetized molecular clouds where C-shocks are\npresent, PAHs and nanoparticles are widely believed to originate from grain\nshattering due to grain-grain collisions. The remaining question is whether\nthese nanoparticles can survive in the dense and hot shocked regions, and how\nto constrain their size and abundance with observations. In this paper, we\npresent a new mechanism to destroy nanoparticles in C-shocks based on\ncentrifugal stress within rapidly spinning nanoparticles spun-up by stochastic\natomic bombardment, which is termed rotational disruption. We find that, due to\nsupersonic neutral gas-charged grain drift in C-shocks, nanoparticles can be\nspun-up to suprathermal rotation by stochastic torques exerted by supersonic\nneutral flow. The resulting centrifugal stress within suprathermally rotating\nnanoparticles can exceed the maximum tensile strength of grain material\n($S_{\\max}$), resulting in rapid disruption of nanoparticles smaller than\n$a\\sim 1$ nm for $S_{\\max}\\sim 10^{9}\\erg\\cm^{-3}$. The proposed disruption\nmechanism is shown to be more efficient than thermal sputtering in controlling\nthe lower cutoff of grain size distribution in C-shocks. We model microwave\nemission from spinning nanoparticles in C-shocks subject to supersonic neutral\ndrift and rotational disruption. We find that suprathermally rotating\nnanoparticles can emit strong microwave radiation, and both peak flux and peak\nfrequency increase with increasing the shock velocity.

We find that CN N=3-2 is bright, and\ndetected in 38% of sources, but its disk-integrated flux is not strongly\ncorrelated to either $^{13}$CO or continuum flux.

Abstract: Disk polarization in (sub)millimeter dust continuum is a rapidly growing\nfield in the ALMA era. It opens up the exciting possibility of detecting and\ncharacterizing magnetic fields and grain growth in disks around young stellar\nobjects. However, to use polarization for probing the disk properties, its\nproduction mechanism must be ascertained first. To date, the conventional\nmechanism involving magnetically aligned grains fails to explain the\npolarization patterns detected in most disks. This is especially true for the\ninclined disk of HL Tau in ALMA Band 3 (wavelength $\\sim 3$ mm), which has an\nelliptical polarization pattern. The elliptical pattern was taken as evidence\nfor polarized emission by dust grains aligned with their long axes\nperpendicular the direction of the radiative flux. We show that the radiatively\naligned grains produce a circular, rather than elliptical, polarization pattern\neven in inclined disks such as HL Tau. An elliptical polarization pattern can\nbe produced if the grains are aligned aerodynamically by the difference in\nrotation speed between the dust and gas through the Gold mechanism. However, a\nstrong azimuthal variation in polarized intensity is expected for both the\nradiative and aerodynamic alignment, but not observed in the HL Tau disk in\nALMA Band 3. We conclude that neither of these two mechanisms alone can explain\nthe data and the origin of the 3 mm polarization remains a mystery. We\nspeculate that this mystery may be resolved by a combination of both direct\nemission and scattering by aerodynamically aligned grains. \n\n"}

We find that, when the planet is\nmassive enough and the induced gap is deep enough, the disc inside the planet's\norbit breaks from the outer disc. The inner and outer discs precess around the\nsystem's total angular momentum vector independently at different precession\nrates, which causes significant disc misalignment. We derive the analytical\nformulae, which are also verified numerically, for: 1) the relationship between\nthe planet mass and the depth/width of the induced gap, 2) the migration and\ninclination damping rates for massive inclined planets, and 3) the condition\nunder which the inner and outer discs can break and undergo differential\nprecession. Then, we carry out Monte-Carlo radiative transfer calculations for\nthe simulated broken discs. Both disc shadowing in near-IR images and gas\nkinematics probed by molecular lines (e.g. from ALMA) can reveal the misaligned\ninner disc. The relationship between the rotation rate of the disc shadow and\nthe precession rate of the inner disc is also provided.

The collected data include extinction-corrected stellar UV and X-ray\ninput spectra (as seen by the disk), photometric fluxes, low and high\nresolution spectra, interferometric data, emission line fluxes, line velocity\nprofiles and line maps.

In this paper, we present the\nresults from pure SED fitting for 27 objects and from the all inclusive\nDIANA-standard models for 14 objects. We fit most infrared to millimeter\nemission line fluxes within a factor better than 3, simultaneously with SED,\nPAH features and radial brightness profiles extracted from images at various\nwavelengths.

Using this dynamical\nconstraint, we derive the maximum size of grains that survive in the ISM for\ndifferent dust models, including contact binary, composite, silicate-core, and\namorphous carbon mantle, and compact grain model for the different radiation\nfields. We find that the different dust models have different maximum size due\nto their different tensile strengths, and the largest maximum size corresponds\nto compact grains with the highest tensile strength.

These data contain\nvaluable information for the dual purposes of planet detection via the measured\nRVs and stellar characterization via the co-added spectra. However,\nconsiderable data analysis challenges exist in extracting these data products\nfrom the observed spectra at the highest possible precision, including the\nissue of poorly-characterized telluric absorption features and the common use\nof an assumed stellar spectral template. In both of these examples,\nprecision-limiting reliance on external information can be sidestepped using\nthe data directly. Here we propose a data-driven method to simultaneously\nextract precise RVs and infer the underlying stellar and telluric spectra using\na linear model (in the log of flux).

We present the\nfirst CO detection in a planetesimal belt around an M star, TWA 7. The\noptically thin CO (J=3-2) emission is co-located with previously identified\ndust emission from the belt, and the emission velocity structure is consistent\nwith Keplerian rotation around the central star. The detected CO is not well\nshielded against photodissociation, and must thus be continuously replenished\nby gas release from exocomets within the belt. We analyze in detail the process\nof exocometary gas release and destruction around young M dwarfs and how this\nprocess compares to earlier type stars. Taking these differences into account,\nwe find that CO generation through exocometary gas release naturally explains\nthe increasing CO detection rates with stellar luminosity, mostly because the\nCO production rate from the collisional cascade is directly proportional to\nstellar luminosity. More luminous stars will therefore on average host more\nmassive (and hence more easily detectable) exocometary CO disks, leading to the\nhigher detection rates observed.

The process of protoplanetary disc formation can result in\ninitial misalignments, where the disc orbital plane is different to the stellar\nequator in single star systems, or to the binary orbital plane in systems with\ntwo stars.

On the other hand, while\nmeshless methods have been widely used in both cosmology, galactic dynamics,\nand planet formation they have not been fully deployed on the MRI problem.

Concerning variants of the\nSPH hydro force formulation we consider both the \"vanilla\" SPH and the PSPH\nvariant included in GIZMO. We find, as expected, that the numerical noise\ninherent in these schemes affects turbulence significantly. A high order\nkernel, free of the pairing instability, is necessary. Both schemes can\nadequately simulate MRI turbulence in unstratified shearing boxes with net\nvertical flux. The turbulence, however, dies out in zero-net-flux unstratified\nboxes, probably due to excessive and numerical dissipation.

The analysis\nof the problem requires a calculation of the enhancement coefficient K for the\nelectron electric dipole moment in the Gd 3+ ion. In this work we perform this\ncalculation. The result is K = -4.9 +- 1.6. Limitations of the accuracy of the\ncalculation are mainly due to the lack of data on Gd 3+ excitation spectra. We\nformulate which quantities have to be measured and/or calculated to improve the\naccuracy. \n\n"}

In our experiment the measured 3He relaxation time is due to the\nconvolution of the 3He longitudinal relaxation time, T1, and the diffusion time\nconstant of 3He in superfluid 4He since depolarization takes place on the\nwalls. We have obtained a 3He relaxation time ~3000 seconds at a temperature\naround 1.9K. We have shown that it's possible to achieve values of wall\ndepolarization probability on the order of (1-2)x10^-7 for polarized 3He in the\nsuperfluid 4He from a dTPB-dPS coated acrylic surface. \n\n"}
