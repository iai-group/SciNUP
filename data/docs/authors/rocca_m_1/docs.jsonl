For larger bases B the\napproximations become increasingly accurate, and we conjecture that P_B(q,v) =\n0 provides the exact critical manifold in the limit of infinite B. Furthermore,\nfor some lattices G, or for the Ising model (q=2) on any G, P_B(q,v) factorises\nfor any choice of B: the zero set of the recurrent factor then provides the\nexact critical manifold.

For pixelwise classification tasks, such as image segmentation and\nobject detection, surrounding image patches are fed into CNN for predicting the\nclasses of centered pixels via forward propagation and for updating CNN\nparameters via backward propagation. However, forward and backward propagation\nwas originally designed for whole-image classification. Directly applying it to\npixelwise classification in a patch-by-patch scanning manner is extremely\ninefficient, because surrounding patches of pixels have large overlaps, which\nlead to a lot of redundant computation.\n  The proposed algorithms eliminate all the redundant computation in\nconvolution and pooling on images by introducing novel d-regularly sparse\nkernels.

A fraction of\npatches of interest can be chosen from each training image for backward\npropagation by applying a mask to the error map at the last CNN layer.

Treating\nthe Universe as a dynamical system it is natural to assume that it is\nnon-linear: indeed, linearity is nothing more than approximation, while\nnon-linearity represents the generic case. It is evident that future models of\nthe Universe must take into account different aspects of its evolution. As soon\nas the scale factor is the only dynamical variable, the quantities which\ndetermine its time dependence must be essentially present in all aspects of the\nUniverse' evolution. Basic characteristics of the cosmological evolution, both\nstatic and dynamical, can be expressed in terms of the parameters ${{H}_{0}}$\nand ${{q}_{0}}$. The very parameters (and higher time derivatives of the scale\nfactor) enable us to construct model-independent kinematics of the cosmological\nexpansion.\n  Time dependence of the scale factor reflects main events in history of the\nUniverse. Moreover it is the deceleration parameter who dictates the expansion\nrate of the Hubble sphere and determines the dynamics of the observable galaxy\nnumber variation: depending on the sign of the deceleration parameter this\nnumber either grows (in the case of decelerated expansion), or we are going to\nstay absolutely alone in the cosmos (if the expansion is accelerated).\n  The intended purpose of the report is reflected in its title --- \"Cosmology\nin terms of the deceleration parameter\".

Despite\nof several attempts to resolve this issue by putting forward specific models,\nthese are far from capturing realistically the transitions that a quantum\nmachine is expected to perform.

In particular, the interaction with the\nscalar graviton in a consistent low-energy theory of gravity and a (radiatively\nand dynamically) stable cosmological framework, leads to these constraints.

While the presence of energy gaps\nbetween the ground and excited states suppresses such excitations, error\ncorrection techniques are required to ensure full scalability of quantum\nannealing. Quantum annealing correction (QAC) is a method that aims to improve\nthe performance of quantum annealers when control over only the problem (final)\nHamiltonian is possible, along with decoding. Building on our earlier work [S.\nMatsuura et al., Phys. Rev.

The topological transition is also understood via a spectral\nflow thought-experiment in a Thouless charge pump, revealing the bulk-boundary\ncorrespondence across the transition. The duality property of the phases and\ntheir entanglement content are studied, revealing a holographic relation with\nthe entanglement at criticality.

In the tensor channel, we obtain the ground state mass\nto be 2.363(39) GeV and 2.384(67) GeV at $m_\\pi\\sim 938$ MeV and $650$ MeV,\nrespectively. In the pseudoscalar channel, when using the gluonic operator\nwhose continuum limit has the form of $\\epsilon_{ijk}TrB_iD_jB_k$, we obtain\nthe ground state mass to be 2.573(55) GeV and 2.585(65) GeV at the two pion\nmasses. These results are compatible with the corresponding results in the\nquenched approximation. In contrast, if we use the topological charge density\nas field operators for the pseudoscalar, the masses of the lowest state are\nmuch lighter (around 1GeV) and compatible with the expected masses of the\nflavor singlet $q\\bar{q}$ meson. This indicates that the operator\n$\\epsilon_{ijk}TrB_iD_jB_k$ and the topological charge density couple rather\ndifferently to the glueball states and $q\\bar{q}$ mesons. The observation of\nthe light flavor singlet pseudoscalar meson can be viewed as the manifestation\nof effects of dynamical quarks. In the scalar channel, the ground state masses\nextracted from the correlation functions of gluonic operators are determined to\nbe around 1.4-1.5 GeV, which is close to the ground state masses from the\ncorrelation functions of the quark bilinear operators. In all cases, the mixing\nbetween glueballs and conventional mesons remains to be further clarified in\nthe future. \n\n"}

Ordinary Type II supernovae (SN) can provide the\ndominant heat source, possible if kinetic mixing interaction exists with\nstrength $\\epsilon \\sim 10^{-9} - 10^{-10}$. Dissipative dark matter halos can\nbe modelled as a fluid governed by Euler's equations.

These steady state conditions can be solved to derive the\nphysical properties, including the halo density and temperature profiles, for\nmodel galaxies. Here, we have considered idealized spherically symmetric\ngalaxies within the mirror dark particle model, as in the earlier paper [paper\nI, arXiv:1707.02528], but we have assumed that the local halo heating in the SN\nvicinity dominates over radiative sources.

Ground states of quantum\nmany-body systems with local interactions typically obey an \"area law\" meaning\nthe entanglement entropy proportional to the boundary length. It is exceptional\nwhen the system is gapless, and the area law had been believed to be violated\nby at most a logarithm for over two decades. Recent discovery of Motzkin and\nFredkin spin chain models is striking, since these models provide significant\nviolation of the entanglement beyond the belief, growing as a square root of\nthe volume in spite of local interactions. Although importance of intensive\nstudy of the models is undoubted to reveal novel features of quantum\nentanglement, it is still far from their complete understanding. In this\narticle, we first analytically compute the Renyi entropy of the Motzkin and\nFredkin models by careful treatment of asymptotic analysis. The Renyi entropy\nis an important quantity, since the whole spectrum of an entangled subsystem is\nreconstructed once the Renyi entropy is known as a function of its parameter.\nWe find non-analytic behavior of the Renyi entropy with respect to the\nparameter, which is a novel phase transition never seen in any other spin chain\nstudied so far.

This is puzzling, because (i) no\nStandard Model (SM) particle is expected to survive passage through Earth at\nsuch energies and incident angles, and (ii) no such events were reported by\nIceCube. In this paper, we address both these issues by invoking a beyond SM\ninterpretation of the EeV events as due to the decay of a long-lived bino in\nthe R-parity violating (RPV) supersymmetry. In particular, a TeV-scale\nslepton/squark can be resonantly produced through the interaction of the EeV\nneutrino with electrons/nucleons inside Earth, that decays to a light,\nlong-lived bino, which survives the propagation through Earth matter before\ndecaying back to neutrinos, leptons and/or quarks, thus producing upgoing air\nshowers in the atmosphere near ANITA.

Zubarev is employed to analyze a relaxation\ndynamics of a spin subsystem. Perturbation of this subsystem in solids may\nproduce a nonequilibrium state which is then relaxed to an equilibrium state\ndue to the interaction between the particles or with a thermal bath (lattice).\nThe generalized kinetic equations were derived previously for a system weakly\ncoupled to a thermal bath to elucidate the nature of transport and relaxation\nprocesses. In this paper, these results are used to describe the relaxation and\ndiffusion of nuclear spins in solids. The aim is to formulate a successive and\ncoherent microscopic description of the nuclear magnetic relaxation and\ndiffusion in solids. The nuclear spin-lattice relaxation is considered and the\nGorter relation is derived. As an example, a theory of spin diffusion of the\nnuclear magnetic moment in dilute alloys (like Cu-Mn) is developed. It is shown\nthat due to the dipolar interaction between host nuclear spins and impurity\nspins, a nonuniform distribution in the host nuclear spin system will occur and\nconsequently the macroscopic relaxation time will be strongly determined by the\nspin diffusion.

Although it is idealized, describing two dimensional packings of round,\nrigid, frictionless, cohesionless disks with coordination number Z=4, it\nappears to describe a central part of the physics present in the more general\ncases. The theorem does not make the strong claims of Edwards' hypothesis, nor\ndoes it rely upon Edwards' hypothesis at any point. Instead, it begins solely\nfrom the physical assumption that closed loops of grains are unable to impose\nstrong force correlations around the loop. This statement is shown to be a\ngeneralization of Boltzmann's Assumption of Molecular Chaos (his\n\\textit{stosszahlansatz}), allowing for the extra symmetries of granular stress\npropagation compared to the more limited symmetries of momentum propagation in\na thermodynamic system. The theorem that follows from this is similar to\nBoltzmann's $H$ theorem and is presented as an alternative to Edwards'\nhypothesis for explaining some granular phenomena.
