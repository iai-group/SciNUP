Our proposal\nis based on the observation that the correlation energy of a d-wave\nsuperconductor increases in magnitude at finite pairing wavevector when\nantiferromagnetic fluctuations are strong. \n\n"}

The electron-phonon coupling\nconstant is found to increase steadily with pressure in the hcp phase, until\nthe pressure reaches a value where the hcp phase becomes unstable. Calculations\nfor the normal pressure $c/a$ ratio predict a phase change somewhere between\ncalculated pressures of 22 and 30 GPa.

From the measured value of the electronic specific\nheat constant and the calculated values of the Fermi level density of states\nand electron-phonon coupling constant, we conclude that the electron-paramagnon\ncoupling constant in hcp Sc should be comparable to the electron-phonon\ncoupling constant.

Their\nMaki parameters have been estimated analyzing their B_c2(T) data within the WHH\napproach. The pronounced PLB of (Ba,K)Fe_2As_2 single crystals from a tin-flux\nis attributed also to a significant As deficiency. Consequences of our results\nare discussed in terms of disorder effects within conventional (CSC) and\nunconventional superconductivity (USC). USC scenarios with nodes on individual\nFermi surface sheets (FSS), can be discarded for our samples. The increase of\ndB_c2/dT|_{T_c} by sizeable disorder provides evidence for an important\nintraband (intra-FSS) contribution to the orbital upper critical field. We\nsuggest that it can be ascribed either to an impurity driven transition from\ns_{+-} USC to CSC of an extended s_{++}-wave state or to a stabilized\ns_{+-}-state provided As-vacancies cause predominantly strong intraband\nscattering in the unitary limit. We compare our results with B_c2 data from the\nliterature with no PLB for fields below 60 to 70 Tesla probed so far. A novel\ndisorder related scenario of a complex interplay of SC with two different\ncompeting magnetic instabilities is suggested. \n\n"}

The dopant\ngenerates a vortex-like quantum distortion of the AF background centered on the\nempty sites, with opposite chirality for cores on the two N\\'eel sublattices.\nEmpty sites are described in terms of spinless fermionic holons and the\nlong-range attraction between spin vortices on two opposite N\\'eel sublattices\nis the holon pairing force, leading eventually to SC. The spin fluctuations are\ndescribed by bosonic spinons with a gap generated by scattering on spin\nvortices. Due to the occupation constraint, there is a gauge attraction between\nholon and spinon, binding them into a physical hole. Through gauge interaction\nthe spin vortex attraction induces the formation of spin-singlet RVB pairs\nreducing the spinon gap. Lowering T, there are two crossovers as precursors of\nthe SC transition: at the higher one a gas of holon pairs appears, reducing the\nhole spectral weight, while at the lower one a gas of spinon pairs also\nappears, giving rise to a gas of incoherent preformed hole pairs with magnetic\nvortices in the plasma phase, supporting a Nernst signal. At an even lower T\nthe hole pairs become coherent and SC appears beyond a critical doping. The\nproposed SC mechanism is not of the BCS-type, because it involves a gain in\nkinetic energy (lowering of spinon gap) and it is \"almost\" of the classical 3D\nXY-type. Since both the spinon gap and the holon pairing originate from the\nsame term in the slave-particle representation of the t-J model, this approach\nincorporates a strong interplay between AF and SC, giving rise to a universal\nrelation between Tc and the energy of the resonance mode, as observed in\nneutron scattering experiments. \n\n"}

For small cavity\ndecay rate, the emission events are uncorrelated and the number of photons in\nthe emitted field becomes larger than one, resembling the build-up of a laser\nfield inside the cavity. At intermediate decay rates (as compared to the\nemitter-cavity coupling) and for few emitters, the statistics of the emitted\nradiation is bunched and strikingly dependent on the parity of the number of\nemitters.

Remarkably, however, it is possible to detect and\ncorrect errors without destroying coherence by using quantum error correcting\ncodes [1]. The simplest of these are the three-qubit codes, which map a\none-qubit state to an entangled three-qubit state and can correct any single\nphase-flip or bit-flip error of one of the three qubits, depending on the code\nused [2]. Here we demonstrate both codes in a superconducting circuit by\nencoding a quantum state as previously shown [3,4], inducing errors on all\nthree qubits with some probability, and decoding the error syndrome by\nreversing the encoding process. This syndrome is then used as the input to a\nthree-qubit gate which corrects the primary qubit if it was flipped. As the\ncode can recover from a single error on any qubit, the fidelity of this process\nshould decrease only quadratically with error probability.

Here, special\nfocus is placed on the critical evaluation of the spin-triplet, odd-parity\npairing scenario applied to Sr2RuO4. After an introduction to superconductors\nwith possible odd-parity pairing, accumulated evidence for the pairing symmetry\nof Sr2RuO4 is examined.

If the system undergoes a second measurement, the statistics of the\nfirst output can be conditioned on the value of the second one. This procedure\nis known as postselection. A postselected weak measurement of an observable can\ngive a large average output of the probe when the postselected state is nearly\northogonal to the initial state of the system. This large value is an\ninterference effect in the readout of the probe, which is initially in a\ncoherent superposition of readout states (also known as pointer states).\nUsually, the weak interaction between system and probe is considered\ninstantaneous, so that the dynamics of the probe can be neglected.

If these fluctuations are not measured, the environment can be\nviewed as a source of noise, causing random evolution of the quantum system\nfrom an initially pure state into a statistical mixture-a process known as\ndecoherence. However, by accurately measuring the environment in real time, the\nquantum system can be maintained in a pure state and its time evolution\ndescribed by a quantum trajectory conditioned on the measurement outcome. We\nemploy weak measurements to monitor a microwave cavity embedding a\nsuperconducting qubit and track the individual quantum trajectories of the\nsystem.

In this view,\nmultiband superconductivity would substantially differ from other systems like\nMgB2, where pairing is predominantly intraband. Indeed, interband-dominated\npairing leads to the coexistence of bonding and antibonding superconducting\nchannels. Here we show that this has profound consequences on the nature of the\nlow-energy superconducting collective modes. In particular, the so-called\nLeggett mode for phase fluctuations is absent in the usual two-band description\nof pnictides. On the other hand, when also the repulsion between the hole bands\nis taken into account, a more general three-band description should be used,\nand a Leggett mode is then allowed. Such a model, that has been proposed for\nstrongly hole-doped 122 compounds, can also admit a low-temperature s+is phase\nwhich breaks the time reversal symmetry. We show that the (quantum and thermal)\ntransition from the ordinary superconductor to the s+is state is accompanied by\nthe vanishing of the mass of Leggett-like phase fluctuations, regardless the\nspecific values of the interaction parameters.

At each iteration,\nthis method randomly picks a block according to any prescribed probability\ndistribution and solves typically several associated proximal subproblems that\nusually have a closed-form solution, until a certain progress on objective\nvalue is achieved. In contrast to the usual randomized block coordinate descent\nmethod [23,20], our method has a nonmonotone flavor and uses variable stepsizes\nthat can partially utilize the local curvature information of the smooth\ncomponent of objective function. We show that any accumulation point of the\nsolution sequence of the method is a stationary point of the problem {\\it\nalmost surely} and the method is capable of finding an approximate stationary\npoint with high probability.

Recently, several groups reported\nexperimental data suggesting that signatures of Majorana modes in topological\ninsulator Josephson junctions (TIJJs) have -- indeed -- been observed. To\nverify this claim, one needs to study the topological properties of low-energy\nAndreev-bound states (ABS) in TIs of which the Majorana modes are a special\ncase. It has been shown theoretically that topologically non-trivial low-energy\nABS are also present in TIJJs with doped topological insulators up to some\ncritical level of doping at which the system undergoes a topological phase\ntransition.

For the convergence analysis, we follow the\nmethodology developed in a companion paper for investigating linear convergence\nof CB-SARS: by exploiting invariance properties of the algorithm, we turn the\nstudy of global linear convergence on scaling-invariant functions into the\nstudy of the stability of an underlying normalized Markov chain (MC). We hence\nprove global linear convergence by studying the stability (irreducibility,\nrecurrence, positivity, geometric ergodicity) of the normalized MC associated\nto the $(1+1)$-ES. More precisely, we prove that starting from any initial\nsolution and any step-size, linear convergence with probability one and in\nexpectation occurs. Our proof holds on unimodal functions that are the\ncomposite of strictly increasing functions by positively homogeneous functions\nwith degree $\\alpha$ (assumed also to be continuously differentiable). This\nfunction class includes composite of norm functions but also non-quasi convex\nfunctions. Because of the composition by a strictly increasing function, it\nincludes non continuous functions. We find that a sufficient condition for\nglobal linear convergence is the step-size increase on linear functions, a\ncondition typically satisfied for standard parameter choices. While introduced\nmore than 40 years ago, we provide here the first proof of global linear\nconvergence for the $(1+1)$-ES with generalized one-fifth success rule and the\nfirst proof of linear convergence for a CB-SARS on such a class of functions\nthat includes non-quasi convex and non-continuous functions. Our proof also\nholds on functions where linear convergence of some CB-SARS was previously\nproven, namely convex-quadratic functions (including the well-know sphere\nfunction). \n\n"}

One\npromising potential implementation is to use superconducting quantum bits in\nthe circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) architecture. There, the low energy\nstates of a nonlinear electronic oscillator are isolated and addressed as a\nqubit. These qubits are capacitively coupled to the modes of a\nmicrowave-frequency transmission line resonator which serves as a quantum\ncommunication bus. Microwave electrical pulses are applied to the resonator to\nmanipulate or measure the qubit state. State control is calibrated using\ndiagnostic sequences that expose systematic errors. Hybridization of the\nresonator with the qubit gives it a nonlinear response when driven strongly,\nuseful for amplifying the measurement signal to enhance accuracy. Qubits\ncoupled to the same bus may coherently interact with one another via the\nexchange of virtual photons. A two-qubit conditional phase gate mediated by\nthis interaction can deterministically entangle its targets, and is used to\ngenerate two-qubit Bell states and three-qubit GHZ states.

In the present\nwork, the suppression of magnetism and the occurrence of superconductivity in\nCrAs as a function of pressure ($p$) were studied by means of muon spin\nrotation. The magnetism remains bulk up to $p\\simeq3.5$~kbar while its volume\nfraction gradually decreases with increasing pressure until it vanishes at\n$p\\simeq$7~kbar.

This Hamiltonian\ncan be embedded in a master equation with losses determined by the details of\nthe electromagnetic environment. Recent experiments indicate, however, that\nwhen a superconducting circuit is driven with microwave signals the observed\nrelaxation rates appear to be substantially different from expectations based\non the electromagnetic environment of the qubit alone.

The proposed technique extends\nthe reduced-order-model error surrogates (ROMES) method to closure modeling.\nThe original ROMES method applied Gaussian-process regression to construct a\nstatistical model that maps cheaply computable error indicators (e.g., residual\nnorm, dual-weighted residuals) to a random variable for either (1) the norm of\nthe state error or (2) the error in a scalar-valued quantity of interest.\nRather than target these two types of errors, this work proposes to construct a\nstatistical model for the state error itself; it achieves this by constructing\nstatistical models for the generalized coordinates characterizing both the\nin-plane error (i.e., the error in the trial subspace) and a low-dimensional\napproximation of the out-of-plane error. The former can be considered a\nstatistical closure model, as it quantifies the error in the ROM generalized\ncoordinates. Because any quantity of interest can be computed as a functional\nof the state, the proposed approach enables any quantity-of-interest error to\nbe statistically quantified a posteriori, as the state-error model can be\npropagated through the associated quantity-of-interest functional. Numerical\nexperiments performed on both linear and nonlinear stationary systems\nillustrate the ability of the technique (1) to improve (expected) ROM\nprediction accuracy by an order of magnitude, (2) to statistically quantify the\nerror in arbitrary quantities of interest, and (3) to realize a more\ncost-effective methodology for reducing the error than a ROM-only approach in\nthe case of nonlinear systems. \n\n"}

However in the special\ncase of a half-filled band, the Fermi surface is nested and the system is at a\nVan Hove singularity.

On approaching the van Hove singularity, the\neffective nesting-vector of the \\gamma band shrinks and further enhances the\nsusceptibility near the wave vector q ~ 0.

The observed behavior is in sharp\ncontrast to that of Ti(4+) substitution in Sr2RuO4 which enhances\nantiferromagnetic fluctuations and subsequently induces incommensurate magnetic\nordering associated with the nesting between the other Fermi-surface sheets\n(\\alpha and \\beta). We thus establish that substitution of appropriate chemical\ndopants can band-selectively modify the spin-fluctuation spectrum in the\nspin-triplet superconductor Sr2RuO4. \n\n"}

We\nclarify the microscopic origin of gradient terms, some of which are included\nphenomenologically in Landau-Ginzburg theory.

The effective\ninteraction leading to the pairing is estimated by means of the perturbation\ntheory. It is shown that the spin triplet superconductivity is stabilized in\nthe wide parameter region.

Impurity-free La1.85Sr0.15CuO4 shows a spin gap of 4meV\nbelow Tc in the antiferromagnetic(AF) incommensurate spin excitation. In\nZn:y=0.004, the spin excitation shows a spin gap of 3meV below Tc. In\nZn:y=0.008 and Zn:y=0.011, however, the magnetic signals at 3meV decrease below\nTc and increase again at lower temperature, indicating an in-gap state. In\nZn:y=0.017, the low-energy spin state remains unchanged with decreasing\ntemperature, and elastic magnetic peaks appear below 20K then exponentially\nincrease.

In Ni:y=0.029, the magnetic signals were observed also\nat 0meV. Thus the spin gap closes with increasing Ni. Furthermore, as omega\nincreases, the magnetic peak width broadens and the peak position, i.e.\nincommensurability, shifts toward the magnetic zone center (pi pi). We\ninterpret the impurity effects as follows: Zn locally makes a\nnon-superconducting island exhibiting the in-gap state in the superconducting\nsea with the spin gap. Zn reduces the superconducting volume fraction, thus\nsuppressing Tc. On the other hand, Ni primarily affects the superconducting\nsea, and the spin excitations become more dispersive and broaden with\nincreasing energy, which is recognized as a consequence of the reduction of\nenergy scale of spin excitations.

To elucidate this long-standing issue, we\nstudy a Hubbard model with a strong onsite impurity potential based on an\nimproved fluctuation-exchange (FLEX) approximation, which we call the GV^I-FLEX\nmethod. This model corresponds to the HTSC with dilute nonmagnetic impurity\nconcentration. We find that (i) both local and staggered susceptibilities are\nstrongly enhanced around the impurity. By this reason, (ii) the quasiparticle\nlifetime as well as the local density of states (DOS) are strongly suppressed\nin a wide area around the impurity (like a Swiss cheese hole), which causes the\n``huge residual resistivity'' beyond the s-wave unitary scattering limit. We\nstress that the excess quasiparticle damping rate caused by impurities has\nstrong momentum-dependence due to non-s-wave scatterings induced by many-body\neffects, so the structure of the ``hot spot/cold spot'' in the host system\npersists against impurity doping.

We explore the electronic Raman\nresponses obtained after subtraction of phononic excitations, and the 2Delta\npeaks that form out of the electronic background below Tc. We find that the\nenergy of the B1g 2Delta peak increases monotonically with decreasing doping\nuntil the peaks become unresolvable. In contrast, the peaks in A1g symmetry\nfollow Tc being resolvable in the Pr-doped films. The B2g responses are weak\nand a 2Delta peak is only detected at the highest doping level. As a\nconsequence of strong electron-phonon coupling, the B1g phonon at 340 cm^-1\nexhibits a pronounced Fano-type line shape. We use a phenomenological model to\ndescribe the line shape that takes into account real and imaginary part of the\nelectronic response.

{"id": "quant-ph/0511033", "contents": "Title: Dephasing due to Intermode Coupling in Superconducting Stripline\n  Resonators Abstract: The nonlinearity exhibited by the kinetic inductance of a superconducting\nstripline couples stripline resonator modes together in a manner suitable for\nquantum non-demolition measurement of the number of photons in a given\nresonator mode. Quantum non-demolition measurement is accomplished by\ncoherently driving another resonator mode, referred to as the detector mode,\nand measuring its response. We show that the sensitivity of such a detection\nscheme is directly related to the dephasing rate induced by such an intermode\ncoupling. We show that high sensitivity is expected when the detector mode is\ndriven into the nonlinear regime and operated close to a point where critical\nslowing down occurs. \n\n"}

By taking advantage of externally controllable state\ntransitions, a state population inversion can be achieved and preserved for the\ntwo working levels of the SQC and, when needed, the SQC can generate a single\nphoton. We can regularly repeat these processes in each cycle when the\npreviously generated photon in the cavity is decaying, so that a periodic\nsequence of single photons can be produced persistently. This provides a\ncontrollable way for implementing a persistent single-photon source on a\nmicroelectronic chip. \n\n"}
