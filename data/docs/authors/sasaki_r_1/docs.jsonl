Many of these supermultiplets have not\nappeared within the superconformal tensor calculus. We formulate a manifestly\nlocally supersymmetric and super-Weyl invariant action principle. In the\nsuper-Weyl gauge W=1, this action reduces to that constructed in\narXiv:0712.3102. We also present a superspace formulation for the dilaton Weyl\nmultiplet. \n\n"}

Indefinite causal structure poses particular\nproblems for theory formulation since many of the core ideas used in the usual\napproaches to theory construction depend on having definite causal structure.\nFor example, the notion of a state across space evolving in time requires that\nwe have some definite causal structure so we can define a state on a space-like\nhypersurface. We will see that many of these problems are mitigated if we are\nable to formulate the theory in a \"formalism local\" (or F-local) fashion. A\nformulation of a physical theory is said to be F-local if, in making\npredictions for any given arbitrary space-time region, we need only refer to\nmathematical objects pertaining to that region. This is a desirable property\nboth on the grounds of efficiency and since, if we have indefinite causal\nstructure, it is not clear how to select some other space-time region on which\nour calculations may depend. The usual ways of formulating physical theories\n(the time evolving state picture, the histories approach, and the local\nequations approach) are not F-local.\n  We set up a framework for probabilistic theories with indefinite causal\nstructure. This, the causaloid framework, is F-local.

However, applying this interpretation naively to quantum measure\ntheory we can find experimentally realisable systems (notably the\nPeres-Kochen-Specker system) in which every history is ruled out by the\ndynamics, challenging us to formulate a deeper realist framework.\n  Our first response is to hold on to our existing interpretative framework and\nattempt a revision of the dynamics that would reduce quantum measure theory to\na classical dynamics. We explore this approach by examining the histories\nformulation of a stochastic-collapse model on a simple (discrete) null-lattice,\nconcluding that the drawbacks of this approach outweigh the benefits.\n  Our second response is to abandon our classically inspired interpretation in\nfavour of Sorkin's 'co-events', a more general ontology that still allows for\nstrict realism.

The\nscenario we propose is strongly motivated by the fact that, for non-Abelian\ngauge fields, self-interactions are responsible for generating extra terms in\nthe cosmological correlation functions, which are naturally absent in the\nAbelian case.

The continuous high-lying\nhadronic mass spectrum is populated at first by the unitary Hagedorn states.\nThen the spectrum turns to be dominated by the colorless orthogonal states as\nthe dilute system is heated up.

In the gravity approximation, weak and strong shocks should be\ndescribed by smooth metrics with no discontinuities.

In contrast, if one fixes the renormalization scale using the\nPrinciple of Maximum Conformality (PMC), all non-conformal $\\{\\beta_i\\}$-terms\nin the perturbative expansion series are summed into the running coupling, and\none obtains a unique, scale-fixed, scheme-independent prediction at any finite\norder.

Yet, in analogy to\nelectric interference, Maki and Griffin predicted in 1965 that thermal current\nflowing through a temperature-biased Josephson tunnel junction is a stationary\nperiodic function of the quantum phase difference between the superconductors.\nThe interplay between quasiparticles and Cooper pairs condensate is at the\norigin of such phase-dependent heat current, and is unique to Josephson\njunctions. In this scenario, a temperature-biased SQUID would allow heat\ncurrents to interfere thus implementing the thermal version of the electric\nJosephson interferometer. The dissipative character of heat flux makes this\ncoherent phenomenon not less extraordinary than its electric (non-dissipative)\ncounterpart. Albeit weird, this striking effect has never been demonstrated so\nfar. Here we report the first experimental realization of a heat\ninterferometer.

The de Sitter spacetime naturally emerges, for the first time, paving\nthe way to future applications in cosmology. The role of the BTZ black hole is\nalso briefly addressed. The singular boundary of the pseudospheres, \"Hilbert\nhorizon\", is seen to be closely related to event horizon of the Rindler, de\nSitter, and BTZ kind. This gives new, and stronger, arguments for the Hawking\nphenomenon to take place. An important geometric parameter, $c$, overlooked in\nearlier work, takes here its place for physical applications, and it is shown\nto be related to graphene's lattice spacing, $\\ell$. It is shown that all\nsurfaces of constant negative curvature, ${\\cal K} = -r^{-2}$, are unified, in\nthe limit $c/r \\to 0$, where they are locally applicable to the Beltrami\npseudosphere.

It is\nwell known that this does not happen in supersymmetric theories because the\nthermal contributions of bosons and fermions do not cancel each other. However,\nfor theories with same spin partners, the answer is less obvious. Using the\nTwin Higgs model as a benchmark, we show that although thermal corrections do\ncancel at the level of quadratic divergences, subleading corrections still\ndrive the system to a restored phase.

In standard quantum state merging,\nentanglement is considered as an expensive resource, while local quantum\noperations can be performed at no additional cost. However, recent developments\nshow that some local operations could be more expensive than others: it is\nreasonable to distinguish between local incoherent operations and local\noperations which can create coherence.

We find that, compared to the single-field case,\nlower values of the energy density at the end of inflation and of the reheating\ntemperature are preferred when an additional scalar field is introduced.

In particular, it leads to a well defined\ntransition between the Newtonian and the modified gravitational regimes, a\ntransition depending on both the Newtonian acceleration and its first\nderivative with respect to radius.

Such a scenario\ndescribes photonic many-body systems such as exciton-polariton gases. Our\nanalysis is based on a set of kinetic equations for a gas of noninteracting\nbosons. By identifying a dimensionless scaling parameter controlling the boson\ndensity, we derive a sharp criterion for which system states become selected to\nhost a macroscopic occupation. We show that with increasing pump power, the\nsystem generically undergoes a sequence of nonequilibrum phase transitions. At\neach transition a state either becomes or ceases to be Bose selected (i.e. to\nhost a condensate): The state which first acquires a condensate when the\npumping exceeds a threshold is the one with the largest ratio of pumping to\nloss. This intuitive behavior resembles simple lasing. In the limit of strong\npumping, the coupling to the heat bath becomes dominant so that eventually the\nground state is selected, corresponding to equilibrium(-like) Bose\ncondensation. For intermediate pumping strengths, several states become\nselected giving rise to fragmented nonequilibrium Bose condensation.

We describe the loss of measurement independence for each\nobserver using the parameters $M_1$ and $M_2$, as defined by Hall in 2010, and\nalso by a more complete description that adds two new parameters, which we call\n$\\hat{M}_1$ and $\\hat{M}_2$, deriving a modified Bell inequality for each\ndescription.

In particular, we\ndiscuss the absolutely crucial property of {\\em isospectrality} of the\naforementioned transformations which guarantees that the quasinormal mode (QNM)\nspectra of potentials, related via the transformation, completely coincide. We\ndemonstrate that, while the first two types of the Darboux transformations (DT\nand BDT) are indeed isospectral, the situation is wildly different for the GDT:\nit violates the isospectrality requirement and is therefore only valid for the\nsolutions with just one fixed frequency. Furthermore, it is shown that although\nin this case the GDT does provide a relationship between two arbitrary\npotentials (a short-ranged and a long-ranged potentials relationship being just\na trivial example), this relationship ends up being completely formal. Finally,\nwe consider frequency-dependent potentials.

In the early Universe, decays of a long\nlived particle produce $B$ mesons and anti-mesons out of thermal equilibrium.\nThese mesons/anti-mesons then undergo CP violating oscillations before quickly\ndecaying into visible and dark sector particles.

Here,\nusing a large set of randomly prepared $X$ states and analytically obtained\nexpressions of various measures of coherence (e.g., relative entropy of\ncoherence, $l1$ norm of coherence, coherence via skew information, and\nfirst-order coherence), it is established that these measures of quantum\ncoherence cannot be used to perform ordering of a set of quantum states based\non the amount of coherence present in a state.

Here we consider qubits\nencoded with constant space overhead (i.e. finite encoding rate) in the limit\nof arbitrarily large code distance $d$ through the use of topological codes\nassociated to triangulations of hyperbolic surfaces. We introduce explicit\nprotocols to demonstrate how Dehn twists of the hyperbolic surface can be\nimplemented on the code through constant depth unitary circuits, without\nincreasing the space overhead. The circuit for a given Dehn twist consists of a\npermutation of physical qubits, followed by a constant depth local unitary\ncircuit, where locality here is defined with respect to a hyperbolic metric\nthat defines the code. Applying our results to the hyperbolic Fibonacci\nTuraev-Viro code implies the possibility of applying universal logical gate\nsets on encoded qubits through constant depth unitary circuits and with\nconstant space overhead. Our circuits are inherently protected from errors as\nthey map local operators to local operators while changing the size of their\nsupport by at most a constant factor; in the presence of noisy syndrome\nmeasurements, our results suggest the possibility of universal fault tolerant\nquantum computation with constant space overhead and time overhead of\n$\\mathcal{O}(d/\\log d)$.

In this paper we construct a new solution of the tetrahedron\nequation, which provides in this way the two-dimensional solvable models\nrelated to finite-dimensional highest weight representations for all quantum\naffine algebra $U_q(\\hat{sl}(n))$, where the rank $n$ coincides with the size\nof the hidden dimension. These models are related with an anisotropic\ndeformation of the $sl(n)$-invariant Heisenberg magnets. They were extensively\nstudied for a long time, but the hidden 3d structure was hitherto unknown. Our\nresults lead to a remarkable exact \"rank-size\" duality relation for the nested\nBethe Ansatz solution for these models. Note also, that the above solution of\nthe tetrahedron equation arises in the quantization of the \"resonant three-wave\nscattering\" model, which is a well-known integrable classical system in 2+1\ndimensions. \n\n"}

The flows on the spectral\nside come from the action of a Heisenberg subgroup of the loop group. The\ndifferential data are flat connections known as opers. The flows on the\ndifferential side come from a generalized Drinfeld-Sokolov hierarchy. Our\nisomorphism between the two sides provides a geometric description of the\nentire phase space of the Drinfeld-Sokolov hierarchy. It extends the Krichever\nconstruction of special algebro-geometric solutions of the n-th KdV hierarchy,\ncorresponding to G=SL(n).\n  An interesting feature is the appearance of formal spectral curves, replacing\nthe projective spectral curves of the classical approach. The geometry of these\n(usually singular) curves reflects the fine structure of loop groups, in\nparticular the detailed classification of their Cartan subgroups. To each such\ncurve corresponds a homogeneous space of the loop group and a soliton system.\nMoreover the flows of the system have interpretations in terms of Jacobians of\nformal curves. \n\n"}

{"id": "quant-ph/0603011", "contents": "Title: How to Derive the Hilbert-Space Formulation of Quantum Mechanics From\n  Purely Operational Axioms Abstract: In the present paper I show how it is possible to derive the Hilbert space\nformulation of Quantum Mechanics from a comprehensive definition of \"physical\nexperiment\" and assuming \"experimental accessibility and simplicity\" as\nspecified by five simple Postulates. This accomplishes the program presented in\nform of conjectures in the previous paper quant-ph/0506034. Pivotal roles are\nplayed by the \"local observability principle\", which reconciles the holism of\nnonlocality with the reductionism of local observation, and by the postulated\nexistence of \"informationally complete observables\" and of a \"symmetric\nfaithful state\". This last notion allows one to introduce an operational\ndefinition for the real version of the \"adjoint\"--i. e. the transposition--from\nwhich one can derive a real Hilbert-space structure via either the\nMackey-Kakutani or the Gelfand-Naimark-Segal constructions. Here I analyze in\ndetail only the Gelfand-Naimark-Segal construction, which leads to a real\nHilbert space structure analogous to that of (classes of generally unbounded)\nselfadjoint operators in Quantum Mechanics. For finite dimensions, general\ndimensionality theorems that can be derived from a local observability\nprinciple, allow us to represent the elements of the real Hilbert space as\noperators over an underlying complex Hilbert space (see, however, a still open\nproblem at the end of the paper).

They showed that the quantum\ninformation is nothing else than the maximal Fisher information in a\nmeasurement of the quantum system, maximized over all possible measurements.\nCombining this fact with classical statistical results, they argued that the\nquantum information determines the asymptotically optimal rate at which\nneighbouring states on some smooth curve can be distinguished, based on\narbitrary measurements on $n$ identical copies of the given quantum system.\n  We show that the measurement which maximizes the Fisher information typically\ndepends on the true, unknown, state of the quantum system.
