The former optical medium is deduced from the stereographic projection of\na virtual sphere and displays a heterogeneous refractive index n(r) which is\nproportional to the inverse of 1+r^2. The latter is described by a homogeneous,\nbut negative, refractive index. It has been suggested that the fisheye makes a\nperfect lens without negative refraction [Leonhardt, Philbin\narxiv:0805.4778v2]. However, we point out that the definition of\nsuper-resolution in such a heterogeneous medium should be computed with respect\nto the wavelength in a homogenized medium, and it is perhaps more adequate to\ntalk about a conjugate image rather than a perfect image (the former does not\nnecessarily contains the evanescent components of the source).

In intrinsic monolayer and bilayer graphene, when\nsymmetry is not broken by external fields, the only spin-orbit coupling present\nat low energy near the corner of the Brillouin zone is the Kane-Mele term, that\nopens a bulk energy gap but does not break the spin degeneracy of the energy\nbands [C.

The generation of a spin current is discussed by\ncalculating the thermal spin transfer torque, which breaks the spin\nconservation law for conduction electrons and operates the coherent magnon\nstate. Inhomogeneous thermal fluctuations between conduction electrons and\nmagnons induce a net spin current, which is pumped into the adjacent\nnon-magnetic metal. The pumped spin current is proportional to the temperature\ndifference. When the effective temperature of magnons is lower than that of\nconduction electrons, localized spins lose spin angular momentum by emitting\nmagnons and conduction electrons flip from down to up by absorbing all the\nemitted momentum, and vice versa. Magnons at the zero mode cannot contribute to\nthermal spin pumping because they are eliminated by the spin-flip condition.\nConsequently thermal spin pumping does not cost any kinds of applied magnetic\nfields.

Under special circumstances, a\nsubspace of the system's Hilbert space remains coherent, or \"decoherence free\",\nand the reduced density matrix approaches a non-trivial limit which contains\ninformation on its initial quantum state, despite the coupling to the\nenvironment. This situation is called \"partial decoherence\". Here we find the\nconditions for partial decoherence for a mesoscopic system (with $N$ quantum\nstates) which is coupled to an environment. When the Hamiltonian of the system\ncommutes with the total Hamiltonian, one has \"adiabatic decoherence\", which\nyields N-1 time-independent combinations of the reduced density matrix\nelements. In the presence of a magnetic flux, one can measure circulating\ncurrents around loops in the system even at long times, and use them to\nretrieve information on the initial state. For N=2, we demonstrate that partial\ndecoherence can happen only under adiabatic decoherence conditions. However,\nfor $N>2$ we find partial decoherence even when the Hamiltonian of the system\ndoes not commute with the total Hamiltonian, and we obtain the general\nconditions for such non-adiabatic partial decoherence. For an electron moving\non a ring, with $N>2$ single-level quantum dots, non-adiabatic partial\ndecoherence can arise only when the total flux through the ring vanishes (or\nequals an integer number of flux quanta), and therefore there is no asymptotic\ncirculating current. \n\n"}

Despite decades of research into\nnonlinear response theory, and the occasional discovery of materials with large\nnonlinear responses, there has been no systematic investigation into the\nmaximum amount of nonlinear optical response attainable in solid-state\nmaterials. In this work, we present an upper bound on the second-order response\nfunctions of materials, which controls the SHG and shift current responses. We\nshow that this bound depends on the band gap, band width, and geometrical\nproperties of the material in question. We find that Kuzyk's bound for the\nmaximum SHG of isolated molecules can be exceeded by conjugation or\ncondensation of molecules to form molecular solids, and that strongly coupled\nsystems generally have larger responses than weakly coupled or isolated ones.\nAs a proof of principle, we perform first-principles calculations of the\nresponse tensors of a wide variety of materials, finding that the materials in\nour database do not yet saturate the upper bound. This suggests that new large\nSHG and shift current materials will likely be discovered by future materials\nresearch guided by the factors mentioned in this work. \n\n"}

Based on our recent theory on the dependent scattering\nmechanism in random media composed of discrete dual-dipolar scatterers\n(\\textit{Physical Review A 97, 023836}), in this paper, we study the\nhard-sphere Yukawa (HSY) random media, in order to further elucidate the role\nof structural correlations in the dependent scattering mechanism and hence\noptical scattering properties. Here, we consider charged colloidal suspensions,\nwhose effective pair interaction between colloids is described by a screened\nCoulomb (Yukawa) potential. By means of adding salt ions, the pair interaction\nbetween the charged particles can be flexibly tailored and therefore the\nstructural correlations are modified. It is shown that this strategy can affect\nthe optical properties significantly. For colloidal $\\mathrm{TiO_2}$\nsuspensions, the modification of electric and magnetic dipole excitations\ninduced by the structural correlations can substantially influence the optical\nscattering properties, in addition to the far-field interference effect\ndescribed by the structure factor. However, this modification is only slightly\naltered by different salt concentrations and is mainly because of the\npacking-density-dependent screening effect. On the other hand, for low\nrefractive index colloidal polystyrene suspensions, the dependent scattering\nmechanism mainly involves the far-field interference effect, and the effective\nexciting field amplitude for electric dipole almost remains unchanged under\ndifferent structural correlations. The present study has profound implications\nfor understanding the role of structural correlations in dependent scattering\nmechanism. \n\n"}

The theory includes the hitherto overlooked\ncapacitive effects due to the finite spatial extension of a surface. The basic\nstructure of this theory is independent of the particulars of electron\ndynamics. Analytical expressions have been obtained of the charge\ndensity-density response function, which is naturally parsed into two parts.\nOne of them represents a bulk property while the other a pure surface property.\nWe apply the theory to study the responses according to several electronic\ndynamics models and provide a unified view of their validity and limitations.\nThe models studied include the local dielectric model (DM), the dispersive\nhydrodynamic model (HDM) and specular reflection model (SRM), as well as the\nless common semi-classical model (SCM) based on Boltzmann's transport equation.\nWe show that, in terms of their basic equations, the SRM is an extension of the\nHDM, just as the HDM is an extension of the DM. The SCM improves over the SRM\ncritically through the inclusion of translation symmetry breaking and surface\nroughness effects. We then employ the response function to evaluate the\nso-called dynamical structure factor, which plays an important role in particle\nscattering. As expected, this factor reveals a peak due to the excitation of\nsurface plasma waves (SPWs). Surprisingly, however, the peak is shown to be\nconsiderably sharper in the SCM than in other models, indicating an incipient\ninstability of the system according to this model. We also study the\ndistribution of charges induced by a charged particle grazing over a SIM\nsurface at constant speed. This distribution is shown to contain model-specific\nfeatures that are of immediate experimental interest. \n\n"}

Moreover, a relation with the c=1 unitary Weyl fermion has been\nsuggested. We construct the complete unitary theory and show that it\nconsistently describes the edge excitations of the Haldane-Rezayi state.\nActually, we show that the unitary (c=1) and non-unitary (c=-2) theories are\nrelated by a local map between the two sets of fields and by a suitable change\nof conjugation. The unitary theory of the Haldane-Rezayi state is found to be\nthe same as that of the 331 paired Hall state. Furthermore, the analysis of\nmodular invariant partition functions shows that no alternative unitary\ndescriptions are possible for the Haldane-Rezayi state within the class of\nrational conformal field theories with abelian current algebra. Finally, the\nknown c=3/2 conformal theory of the Pfaffian state is also obtained from the\n331 theory by a reduction of degrees of freedom which can be physically\nrealized in the double-layer Hall systems. \n\n"}
