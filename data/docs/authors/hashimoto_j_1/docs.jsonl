We constrain a\nmass-to-'observed' light ratio, M_h/L_band. For narrow-band surveys, L_band is\nsimply related to the intrinsic Ly-alpha luminosity with a survival fraction of\nLy-alpha photons, alpha_esc. The mass-to-'bolometric light', M_h/L_bol, can\nalso be deduced, once the metallicity and stellar mass spectrum are given. The\ninferred M_h/L_bol is more sensitive to metallicity than to the mass spectrum.\nWe find the following constraints on a mass-to-light ratio of Ly-alpha emitters\nfrom 5.7 < z < 7: (M_h/L_bol)(alpha_{esc}epsilon^{1/gamma})^{-1}=21-38, 14-26,\nand 9-17 for Z=0, 1/50, and 1 Z_sun, respectively, where epsilon is the 'duty\ncycle' of Ly-alpha emitters, and gamma ~ 2 is a local slope of the cumulative\nluminosity function. Only weak lower limits are obtained for z=8.8. Therefore,\nLy-alpha emitters are consistent with either starburst galaxies M_h/L_bol ~\n0.1-1 with a smaller Ly-alpha survival fraction, alpha_{esc}epsilon^{1/gamma}\n~0.01-0.05, or normal populations (M_h/L_bol ~ 10) if a good fraction of\nLy-alpha photons survived, alpha_{esc}epsilon^{1/gamma} ~ 0.5-1. We find no\nevidence for the end of reionization in the luminosity functions of Ly-alpha\nemitters discovered in the current Ly-alpha surveys, including recent discovery\nof one Ly-alpha emitter at z=7. The data are consistent with no evolution of\nintrinsic properties of Ly-alpha emitters or neutral fraction in the\nintergalactic medium up to z=7.

From this variation, a relative amplitude of the surface\ndifferential rotation lower than about 1 percent is estimated.

We investigate the\ndependence of light scattering properties on wavelength, cluster size and\nporosity using these aggregate models. We find that while the shape of the\nphase function depends mainly on the size parameter of the aggregates, the\nlinear polarization depends on both the size parameter and the porosity of the\naggregates, with increasing degree of polarization as the porosity increases.\nContrary to previous studies, we argue that monomer size has negligible effects\non the light scattering properties of ballistic aggregates, as long as the\nconstituent monomer is smaller than the incident wavelength up to\n2*pi*a_0/lambda\\sim 1.6 where a_0 is the monomer radius.

This result is\nsignificant at about the 1 $\\sigma$ level in each cluster. For the complete set\nof clusters we reject the null hypothesis--that Solar and intermediate-mass\nstars lose their disks at the same rate--with 95-99.9% confidence. To interpret\nthis behaviour, we investigate the impact of grain growth, binary companions,\nand photoevaporation on the evolution of disk signatures. Changes in grain\ngrowth timescales at fixed disk temperature may explain why early-type stars\nwith IR excesses appear to evolve faster than their later-type counterparts.\nLittle evidence that binary companions affect disk evolution suggests that\nphotoevaporation is the more likely mechanism for disk dispersal. A simple\nphotoevaporation model provides a good fit to the observed disk fractions for\nSolar and intermediate-mass stars. Although the current mass-dependent disk\ndispersal signal is not strong, larger and more complete samples of clusters\nwith ages of 3-5 Myr can improve the significance and provide better tests of\ntheoretical models.

We also\nshow that any Bondi-Hoyle accretion of contaminated residual gas from the natal\nstar cluster made a negligible contribution to the primordial Al-26 inventory\nof the Solar System. These results are consistent with the absence of the\noxygen isotopic signature expected with any late introduction of supernova\nejecta into the protoplanetary disk.

However, such studies cannot explain the small\nsemi-major axes (a) of extrasolar planetary systems, if planets are formed, as\nthe standard planet formation theory suggests, beyond the ice line.\n  In this paper, we numerically study the evolution of three-planet systems in\ndissipating gas disks, and constrain the initial conditions that reproduce the\nobserved semi-major axis and eccentricity distributions simultaneously. We\nadopt the initial conditions that are motivated by the standard planet\nformation theory, and self-consistently simulate the disk evolution, and planet\nmigration by using a hybrid N-body and 1D gas disk code.

Hydrostatic\n  disk structure and inner rim Abstract: This paper introduces a new disk code, called ProDiMo, to calculate the\nthermo-chemical structure of protoplanetary disks and to interpret gas emission\nlines from UV to sub-mm. We combine frequency-dependent 2D dust continuum\nradiative transfer, kinetic gas-phase and UV photo-chemistry, ice formation,\nand detailed non-LTE heating & cooling balance with the consistent calculation\nof the hydrostatic disk structure. We include FeII and CO ro-vibrational line\nheating/cooling relevant for the high-density gas close to the star, and apply\na modified escape probability treatment. The models are characterized by a high\ndegree of consistency between the various physical, chemical and radiative\nprocesses, where the mutual feedbacks are solved iteratively. In application to\na T Tauri disk extending from 0.5AU to 500AU, the models are featured by a\npuffed-up inner rim and show that the dense, shielded and cold midplane\n(z/r<0.1, Tg~Td) is surrounded by a layer of hot (5000K) and thin (10^7 to 10^8\ncm^-3) atomic gas which extends radially to about 10AU, and vertically up to\nz/r~0.5. This layer is predominantly heated by the stellar UV (e.g.\nPAH-heating) and cools via FeII semi-forbidden and OI 630nm optical line\nemission. The dust grains in this \"halo\" scatter the star light back onto the\ndisk which impacts the photo-chemistry. The more distant regions are\ncharacterized by a cooler flaring structure.

As\nplanets are thought to form in circumstellar disks, one important question in\nplanet formation is determining whether, and to what degree, a gaseous disk\naffects an eccentric planet's orbit. Recent studies have probed the interaction\nbetween a disk and a terrestrial planet on an eccentric orbit, and the\ninteraction between a disk and a gas giant on a nearly circular orbit, but\nlittle is known about the interaction between a disk and an eccentric gas\ngiant. Such a scenario could arise due to scattering while the disk is still\npresent, or perhaps through planet formation via gravitational instability. We\nfill this gap with simulations of eccentric, massive (gap-forming) planets in\ndisks using the hydrodynamical code FARGO. Although the long-term orbital\nevolution of the planet depends on disk properties, including the boundary\nconditions used, the disk always acts to damp eccentricity when the planet is\nreleased into the disk. This eccentricity damping takes place on a timescale of\n40 years, 15 times faster than the migration timescale. \n\n"}

This restriction relates to the requirement that dust has to be\nconcentrated in spiral features on a timescale that is less than the (roughly\ndynamical) lifetime of such features, and that such rapid accumulation requires\nspiral features whose fractional amplitude is not much less than unity. This in\nturn requires that the cooling timescale of the gas is relatively short, which\nrestricts the process to the outer disc. We point out that the efficient\nconversion of a large fraction of the primordial dust in the disc into\nplanetesimals could rescue this material from the well known problem of rapid\ninward migration at a $\\sim$ metre size scale and that in principle the\ncollisional evolution of these objects could help to re-supply small dust to\nthe protostellar disc.

Indeed, their inclusion is crucial since the sources in M31\nmicrolensing events are mainly giant stars. Light curves with detectable\nplanetary features are selected by looking for significant deviations from the\ncorresponding Paczy\\'{n}ski shapes. We find that the time scale of planetary\ndeviations in light curves increase (up to 3-4 days) as the source size\nincreases. This means that only few exposures per day, depending also on the\nrequired accuracy, may be sufficient to reveal in the light curve a planetary\ncompanion. Although the mean planet mass for the selected events is about $2\nM_{\\rm {Jupiter}}$, even small mass planets ($M_{\\rm P} < 20 M_{\\oplus}$) can\ncause significant deviations, at least in the observations with large\ntelescopes.

Each radius in the hot flow\nproduces fluctuations, and we further assume that these are damped on the\nviscous frequency. Integrating over radii gives broad band continuum noise\npower between low and high frequency breaks which are set by the viscous\ntimescale at the outer and inner edge of the hot flow, respectively.\nLense-Thirring (vertical) precession of the entire hot flow superimposes the\nlow frequency QPO on this continuum power.\n  We test this model on the power spectra seen in the neutron star systems\n(atolls) as these have the key advantage that the (upper) kHz QPO most likely\nindependently tracks the truncation radius. These show that this model can give\na consistent solution, with the truncation radius decreasing from 20-8 Rg while\nthe inner radius of the flow remains approximately constant at ~4.5 Rg i.e. 9.2\nkm.

In particular, the power of\nthe quadrupole moment of the CMB fluctuations is remarkably low, and the\nquadrupole and octopole moments are aligned mutually and with the geometry of\nthe Solar system.

In order for its emissivity to demonstrate a\nflat, CMB-like wavelength dependence over the WMAP wavelengths (3 through 14\nmm), and to be invisible in the infrared light, its particles must be\nmacroscopic.

The spectrum of the\nstar is then no longer the same as when it is unmagnified, and measurements of\nthe atmospheric parameters and abundances will be affected. The accuracy of\nabundances measured from spectra taken during microlensing events has become\nimportant recently because of the use of highly magnified dwarf stars to probe\nabundance ratios and the abundance distribution in the Galactic bulge. In this\npaper, we investigate the effect of finite source effects on spectra by using\nmagnification profiles motivated by two events to synthesize spectra for dwarfs\nbetween 5000K to 6200K at solar metallicity. We adopt the usual techniques for\nanalyzing the microlensed dwarfs, namely, spectroscopic determination of\ntemperature, gravity, and microturbulent velocity, relying on equivalent\nwidths. We find that ignoring the finite source effects for the more extreme\ncase results in errors in Teff < 45K, in log g of <0.1 dex and in\nmicroturbulent velocity of <0.1 km/s.

The MHD calculations use the stratified shearing-box approach and\ninclude grain settling and the feedback from the changing dust abundance on the\nresistivity of the gas. The two-decade spread in accretion rates among T Tauri\nstars is too large to result solely from variety in the grain size and stellar\nX-ray luminosity, but can be produced by varying these together with the disk\nmagnetic flux. The diversity in the silicate bands can come from the coupling\nof grain settling to the distribution of the magneto-rotational turbulence,\nthrough three effects: (1) Recombination on grains yields a magnetically\ninactive dead zone extending above two scale heights, while turbulence in the\nmagnetically active disk atmosphere overshoots the dead zone boundary by only\nabout one scale height. (2) Grains deep in the dead zone oscillate vertically\nin waves driven by the turbulent layer above, but on average settle at the\nlaminar rates, so the interior of the dead zone is a particle sink and the disk\natmosphere becomes dust-depleted. (3) With sufficient depletion, the dead zone\nis thinner and mixing dredges grains off the midplane. The MHD results also\nshow that the magnetic activity intermittently lifts clouds of dust into the\natmosphere.

The angular resolution of the maps is as high as\n0.15arcsec, or 20AU at the distance of the Taurus cloud, which is a factor of 2\nhigher than has been achieved to date at these wavelengths. The unprecedented\ndetail of the resulting disk images enables us to address three important\nquestions related to the formation of planets. (1) What is the radial\ndistribution of the circumstellar dust? (2) Does the dust emission show any\nindication of gaps that might signify the presence of (proto-)planets? (3) Do\nthe dust properties depend on the orbital radius? We find that modeling the\ndisk surface density in terms of either a classical power law or the similarity\nsolution for viscous disk evolution, reproduces the observations well. The\n1.3mm image from RYTau shows two peaks separated by 0.2arcsec with a decline in\nthe dust emission toward the stellar position, which is significant at about\n2-4sigma. For both RYTau and DGTau, the dust emission at radii larger than 15\nAU displays no significant deviation from an unperturbed viscous disk model. In\nparticular, no radial gaps in the dust distribution are detected. Under\nreasonable assumptions, we exclude the presence of planets more massive than 5\nJupiter masses orbiting either star at distances between about 10 and 60 AU.\nThe radial variation of the dust opacity slope, beta, was investigated by\ncomparing the 1.3mm and 2.8mm observations.

Following the collapse from\nthe prestellar phase allows us to model the early embedded phase of disk\nformation and evolution. During this time, the disk is susceptible to\nfragmentation, depending upon the properties of the initial prestellar core.\nGlobally, we find that higher initial core angular momentum and mass content\nfavors more fragmentation, but higher levels of background radiation can\nmoderate the tendency to fragment. A higher rate of mass infall onto the disk\nthan that onto the star is a necessary but not sufficient condition for disk\nfragmentation. More locally, both the Toomre Q-parameter needs to be below a\ncritical value _and_ the local cooling time needs to be shorter than a few\ntimes the local dynamical time.

Compared\nto its twins, the Sun exhibits a deficiency of refractory elements (those with\ncondensation temperatures Tc>900K) relative to volatiles (Tc<900K). This\nfinding is speculated to be a signature of the planet formation that occurred\nmore efficiently around the Sun compared with the majority of solar twins.\nFurthermore, within this scenario, it seems more likely that the abundance\npatterns found are specifically related to the formation of terrestrial\nplanets. In this work we analyze abundance results from six large independent\nstellar abundance surveys to determine whether they confirm or reject this\nobservational finding. We show that the elemental abundances derived for solar\nanalogs in these six studies are consistent with the Tc trend suggested as a\nplanet formation signature. The same conclusion is reached when those results\nare averaged heterogeneously. We also investigate the dependency of the\nabundances with first ionization potential (FIP), which correlates well with\nTc. A trend with FIP would suggest a different origin for the abundance\npatterns found, but we show that the correlation with Tc is statistically more\nsignificant. We encourage similar investigations of metal-rich solar analogs\nand late F-type dwarf stars, for which the hypothesis of a planet formation\nsignature in the elemental abundances makes very specific predictions. Finally,\nwe examine a recent paper that claims that the abundance patterns of two stars\nhosting super-Earth like planets contradict the planet formation signature\nhypothesis. Instead, we find that the chemical compositions of these two stars\nare fully compatible with our hypothesis. \n\n"}

An increase in M_cl and/or \\beta\nleads to the formation of protostellar disks that are more susceptible to\ngravitational instability.

Only cloud cores with high enough M_cl or \\beta may eventually form\nwide-separation binary/multiple systems with low mass ratios and brown dwarf or\nsub-solar mass companions. It is feasible that such systems may eventually\nbreak up, giving birth to rogue brown dwarfs. Protostellar disks of {\\it equal}\nage formed from cloud cores of greater mass (but equal \\beta) are generally\ndenser, hotter, larger, and more massive.

Recently, it has been\npointed out that negative charging of dust in the weakly ionized disks could\nsignificantly slow down the coagulation process. In this paper, we apply the\ngrowth criteria obtained in Paper I to finding out a location (\"frozen\" zone)\nwhere the charging stalls dust growth at the fractal growth stage. For\nlow-turbulence disks, we find that the frozen zone can cover the major part of\nthe disks at a few to 100 AU from the central star. The maximum mass of the\naggregates is approximately 10^{-7} g at 1 AU and as small as a few monomer\nmasses at 100 AU. Strong turbulence can significantly reduce the size of the\nfrozen zone, but such turbulence will cause the fragmentation of macroscopic\naggregates at later stages. We examine a possibility that complete freezeout of\ndust evolution in low-turbulence disks could be prevented by global transport\nof dust in the disks.

This has been\nfollowed by a phase of even more rapid technological evolution and concomitant\nexpansion of the size of the population, that began when our own particular\n`sapiens' species emerged, just a few hundred thousand years ago. The present\ninvestigation exploits the analogy between the neo-Darwinian genetic evolution\nmechanism governing the first phase, and the memetic evolution mechanism\ngoverning the second phase. From the outset of the latter until very recently\n-- about the year 2000 -- the growth of the global population N was roughly\ngoverned by an equation of the form dN/Ndt= N/T*, in which T* is a coefficient\nintroduced (in 1960) by von Foerster, who evaluated it empirically as about two\nhundred thousand million years. It is shown here how the value of this hitherto\nmysterious timescale governing the memetic phase is explicable in terms of what\nhappenned in the preceding genetic phase. The outcome is that the order of\nmagnitude of the Foerster timescale can be accounted for as the product of the\nrelevant (human) generation timescale, about 20 years, with the number of bits\nof information in the genome, of the order of ten thousand million. Whereas the\norigin of our `homo' genus may well have involved an evolutionary hard step, it\ntranspires that the emergence of our particular `sapiens' species was rather an\nautomatic process. \n\n"}

For this purpose, we\nhave developed radiation hydrodynamic 2D model atmosphere simulations to study\nthe formation of forsterite dust in presence of advection, condensation, and\nsedimentation across the M-L-T VLMs to BDs sequence (Teff = 2800 K to 900 K,\nFreytag et al. 2010).

This rule has been used in the construction of the new\nmodel atmosphere grid, BT-Settl, to determine the microturbulence velocity, the\ndiffusion coefficient, and the advective mixing of molecules as a function of\ndepth.

The wavelength dependence\nof polarization indicates the dominance of Rayleigh scattering with a peak in\nthe blue B and U bands of ~10^-4+/-10^-5 and at least a factor of two lower\nsignal in the V band. The Rayleigh-like wavelength dependence, detected also in\nthe transmitted light during transits, implies a rapid decrease of the\npolarization signal toward longer wavelengths.

The disk atmosphere is\nionized by stellar X-rays, well-coupled to magnetic fields, and sustains a\nturbulent accretion flow driven by magneto-rotational instability, while the\ninterior is resistive and magnetically dead.\n  The turbulent layers heat by absorbing the light from the central star and by\ndissipating the magnetic fields. They are optically-thin to their own radiation\nand cool inefficiently. The optically-thick interior in contrast is heated only\nweakly, by re-emission from the atmosphere. The interior is colder than a\nclassical viscous model, and isothermal.\n  The magnetic fields support an extended atmosphere that absorbs the starlight\n1.5 times higher than the hydrostatic viscous model.

Strong magnetic fields (~10^{15} G) and short spin periods\n(~1-10 ms) have an important influence on how the magnetar interacts with the\ninfalling material. At long spin periods, weak magnetic fields, and high\naccretion rates, sufficient material is accreted to form a black hole, as is\ncommonly found for massive progenitor stars. When B<5*10^{14} G, accretion\ncauses the magnetar to spin sufficiently rapidly to deform triaxially and\nproduce gravitational waves, but only for ~50-200 s until it collapses to a\nblack hole. Conversely, at short spin periods, strong magnetic fields, and low\naccretion rates, the magnetar is in the \"propeller regime\" and avoids becoming\na black hole by expelling incoming material. This process spins down the\nmagnetar, so that gravitational waves are only expected if the initial\nprotoneutron star is spinning rapidly. Even when the magnetar survives, it\naccretes at least ~0.3 solar masses, so we expect magnetars born within these\ntypes of environments to be more massive than the 1.4 solar masses typically\nassociated with neutron stars. The propeller mechanism converts the ~10^{52}\nergs of spin energy in the magnetar into the kinetic energy of an outflow,\nwhich shock heats the outgoing supernova ejecta during the first ~10-30 s.

These activity signatures are interpreted as being\ncaused by coupling of an ionised atmosphere to the stellar magnetic field. What\nremains a puzzle, however, is the mechanism by which such a cool atmosphere can\nproduce the necessary level of ionisation. At these low temperatures, thermal\ngas processes are insufficient, but the formation of clouds sets in. Cloud\nparticles can act as seeds for electron avalanches in streamers that ionise the\nambient gas, and can lead to lightning and indirectly to magnetic field\ncoupling, a combination of processes also expected for protoplanetary disks.\nHowever, the precondition is that the cloud particles are charged.\n  We use results from Drift-Phoenix model atmospheres to investigate\ncollisional processes. We show that ionisation by turbulence-induced dust-dust\ncollisions is the most efficient kinetic process. Dust-dust collisions alone\nare not sufficient to improve the magnetic coupling of the atmosphere inside\nthe cloud layers, but the charges supplied either on grains or within the gas\nphase as separated electrons can trigger secondary non-linear processes.

Multiplanet systems provide two key ingredients for explaining the\norigins of transitional disks. First, multiple planets can clear wide inner\nholes where single planets open only narrow gaps.

We find that both\ntides induced in the star and planet can lead to a significant decrease of the\norbital semi-major axis for orbits having periastron distances smaller than 5-6\nstellar radii (corresponding to periods $\\sim 4-5$ days after the\ncircularisation has been completed) with tides in the star being much stronger\nfor retrograde orbits compared to prograde orbits. We use the simple Skumanich\nlaw for the stellar rotation with its rotational period equal to one month at\nthe age of 5Gyr. The strength of tidal interactions is characterised by\ncircularisation time scale, $t_{ev}$ defined as a time scale of evolution of\nthe planet's semi-major axis due to tides considered as a function of orbital\nperiod $P_{obs}$ after the process of tidal circularisation has been completed.\nWe find that the ratio of the initial circularisation time scales corresponding\nto prograde and retrograde orbits is of order 1.5-2 for a planet of one Jupiter\nmass and $P_{obs}\\sim $ four days. It grows with the mass of the planet, being\nof order five for a five Jupiter mass planet with the same $P_{orb}$. Thus, the\neffect of stellar rotation may provide a bias in the formation of planetary\nsystems having planets on close orbits around their host stars, as a\nconsequence of planet-planet scattering, favouring systems with retrograde\norbits. The results may also be applied to the problem of tidal capture of\nstars in young stellar clusters. \n\n"}

Using linear\nperturbation theory, we analyze the observable properties of the gravitational\nwake due to the object circularly moving in a static homogeneous gaseous\nmedium, in order to derive the Bondi accretion radius $r_B$, the orbital\ndistance $r_p$, and the Mach number of the object. Supersonic motion, producing\na wake of spiral-onion shell structure, exhibits a single-armed Archimedes\nspiral and two-centered circular arcs with respect to the line of sight. The\npitch angle, arm width, and spacing of the spiral pattern are entirely\ndetermined by the orbital distance $r_p$ and Mach number of the object. The\narm-interarm density contrast is proportional to the Bondi accretion radius,\ndecreasing as a function of distance with a power index of -1. The background\ndensity distribution is globally changed from initially uniform to centrally\nconcentrated. The vertical structure of the wake is manifested as circular arcs\nwith the center at the object location. The angular extent of the arcs is\ndetermined by the Mach number of the object motion. Diagnostic probes of\nnonlinear wakes such as a detached bow shock, an absence of the definite inner\narm boundary, the presence of turbulent low density eddies, and elongated\nshapes of arcs are explained in the extension of the linear analysis. The\ndensity enhancement at the center is always $r_B/r_p$ independent of the\nnonlinearity, suggesting that massive objects can substantially modify the\nbackground distribution. These detailed understanding of the wake\ncharacteristics will provide an interpretative framework for both further\ntheoretical works under more complicated situations and future observations to\ndetect the gravitational wakes of hidden objects. \n\n"}

In particular, the Sun may have radially\nmigrated through the galactic disk by up to 5-6 kpc. This has important\nramifications for the structure of the Oort Cloud, as it means that the solar\nsystem may have experienced tidal and stellar perturbations that were\nsignificantly different from its current local galactic environment. To\ncharacterize the effects of solar migration within the Milky Way, we use direct\nnumerical simulations to model the formation of an Oort Cloud around stars that\nend up on solar-type orbits in a galactic-scale simulation of a Milky Way-like\ndisk formation. Surprisingly, our simulations indicate that Sedna's orbit may\nbelong to the classical Oort Cloud. Contrary to previous understanding, we show\nthat field star encounters play a pivotal role in setting the Oort Cloud's\nextreme inner edge, and due to their stochastic nature this inner edge\nsometimes extends to Sedna's orbit. The Sun's galactic migration heightens the\nchance of powerful stellar passages, and Sedna production occurs around ~20-30%\nof the solar-like stars we study. Considering the entire Oort Cloud, we find\nits median distance depends on the minimum galactocentric distance attained\nduring the Sun's orbital history.

Both of these Oort Cloud parameters can vary by an order of\nmagnitude and are usually overestimated by an Oort Cloud formation model that\nassumes a fixed galactic environment.

Being highly non-linear and stochastic, the outcome\nof collapse can only be explored theoretically by performing large ensembles of\nnumerical simulations. Standard practice is to quantify the initial turbulent\nvelocity field in a core in terms of the amount of turbulent energy (or some\nequivalent) and the exponent in the power spectrum (n \\equiv -d log Pk /d log\nk). In this paper, we present a numerical study of the influence of the details\nof the turbulent velocity field on the collapse of an isolated, weakly\nturbulent, low-mass prestellar core. We show that, as long as n > 3 (as is\nusually assumed), a more critical parameter than n is the maximum wavelength in\nthe turbulent velocity field, {\\lambda}_MAX. This is because {\\lambda}_MAX\ncarries most of the turbulent energy, and thereby influences both the amount\nand the spatial coherence of the angular momentum in the core. We show that the\nformation of dense filaments during collapse depends critically on\n{\\lambda}_MAX, and we explain this finding using a force balance analysis.

The cold, dusty\nclumps surrounding RCW 120 are arranged in an almost spherical shell and\nharbour many young stellar objects. By performing high-resolution,\nthree-dimensional SPH simulations of HII regions expanding into fractal\nmolecular clouds, we investigate whether the formation of massive clumps in\ndense, swept-up shells necessarily requires the C&C mechanism. In a second\nstep, we use RADMC-3D to compute the synthetic dust continuum emission from our\nsimulations, in order to compare them with observations of RCW 120 made with\nAPEX-LABOCA at 870 micron. We show that a distribution of clumps similar to the\none seen in RCW 120 can readily be explained by a non-uniform initial molecular\ncloud structure.

This\nis consistent with recent theoretical works, which indicate that the tidal Q of\nplanet-hosting stars can indeed be much larger than the values inferred from\nstellar binaries. On the other hand, recent measurements of Rossiter-McLaughlin\neffects in transiting hot Jupiter systems not only reveal that many such\nsystems have misaligned stellar spin with respect to the orbital axis, but also\nshow that systems with cooler host stars tend to have aligned spin and orbital\naxes. Winn et al. suggested that this obliquity - temperature correlation may\nbe explained by efficient damping of stellar obliquity due to tidal dissipation\nin the star. This explanation, however, is in apparent contradiction with the\nsurvival of these short-period hot Jupiters. We show that in the solar-type\nparent stars of close-in exoplanetary systems, the effective tidal Q governing\nthe damping of stellar obliquity can be much smaller than that governing\norbital decay. This is because for misaligned systems, the tidal potential\ncontains a Fourier component with frequency equal to the stellar spin frequency\n(in the rotating frame of the star). This component can excite inertial waves\nin the convective envelope of the star, and the dissipation of inertial waves\nthen leads to a spin-orbit alignment torque, but not orbital decay. By\ncontrast, for aligned systems, such inertial wave excitation is forbidden since\nthe tidal forcing frequency is much larger than the stellar spin frequency. We\nderive a general effective tidal evolution theory for misaligned binaries,\ntaking account of different tidal responses and dissipation rates for different\ntidal forcing components. \n\n"}

While the initial phases of radial contraction are\ndictated by drag forces and gravity, particle collisions become gradually more\nsignificant as filaments contract beyond Roche density. Here we present a new\nnumerical algorithm for treating momentum and energy exchange in collisions\nbetween numerical superparticles representing a high number of physical\nparticles. We adopt a Monte Carlo approach where superparticle pairs in a grid\ncell collide statistically on the physical collision time-scale. Collisions\noccur by enlarging particles until they touch and solving for the collision\noutcome, accounting for energy dissipation in inelastic collisions. We\ndemonstrate that superparticle collisions can be consistently implemented at a\nmodest computational cost. In protoplanetary disc turbulence driven by the\nstreaming instability, we argue that the relative Keplerian shear velocity\nshould be subtracted during the collision calculation. If it is not subtracted,\ndensity inhomogeneities are too rapidly diffused away, as bloated particles\nexaggerate collision speeds. Local particle densities reach several thousand\ntimes the mid-plane gas density.

Highly excited H2O emission in spatially unresolved\nSpitzer/IRS spectra of a low-mass Class 0 object, NGC 1333 IRAS 4B, has\npreviously been attributed to the envelope-disk accretion shock but could\ninstead be produced in an outflow.

The spectrum has high signal-to-noise in a rich forest of H2O, CO, and OH\nlines, providing a near-complete census of far-IR molecular emission from a\nClass 0 protostar. The excitation diagrams for the three molecules all require\nfits with two excitation temperatures, indicating the presence of two physical\ncomponents. The highly excited component of H2O emission is characterized by\nsubthermal excitation of 1500 K gas with a density of 10^5 - 10^7 cm-3,\nconditions that also reproduce the mid-IR H2O emission detected by Spitzer. On\nthe other hand, a high density, low temperature gas can reproduce the H2O\nspectrum observed by Spitzer but underpredicts the H2O lines seen by Herschel.\nNyquist-sampled spectral maps of several lines show two spatial components of\nH2O emission, one centered at 1200 AU south of the central source at the\nposition of the blueshifted outflow lobe and a second centered on-source. Both\nspatial components of the far-IR H2O emission are consistent with emission from\nthe outflow.

Originally targeted with adaptive optics\nbecause it showed a long-term radial velocity acceleration (trend), we have\nmonitored this star with precise Doppler measurements and have now established\na 24 year time baseline.

The binary has a maximum separation of 1\narcsec with less than 0.1 mags difference between components with identical\nultra-red colors (g-i=1.49+-0.01 mags). The orbit of the mutual components was\nfound to have a period of 961.2+-4.6 days with a semi-major axis of 21000+-160\nkm and eccentricity of 0.1529+-0.0028.

Methodology\n  and Validation Abstract: We examine the observational consequences of partial gaps being opened by\nplanets in protoplanetary disks. We model the disk using a static alpha-disk\nmodel with detailed radiative transfer, parametrizing the shape and size of the\npartially cleared gaps based on the results of hydrodynamic simulations.\nShadowing and illumination by stellar irradiation at the surface of the gap\nleads to increased contrast as the gap trough is deepened by shadowing and\ncooling and the far gap wall is puffed up by illumination and heating. In\ncalculating observables, we find that multiple scattering is important and\nderive an approximation to include these effects. A gap produced by a 200\nM_Earth (70 M_Earth) planet at 10 AU can lower/raise the midplane temperature\nof the disk by up to ~-25/+29% (~-11/+19%) by shadowing in the gap trough and\nillumination on the far shoulder of the gap.

This paper is devoted to\noutlining the components of observing programs that can discover planets\norbiting stars predicted to make a close approach to a background star. If the\ntime and distance of closest approach can be well predicted, then the system\ncan be targeted for individual study.

Here, we study the evolution of\nwind-accretion disks, using a numerical approach which allows us to follow the\nlong term evolution. For a broad range of initial conditions, we derive the\nradial density and temperature profiles of the disk. In most cases,\nwind-accretion leads to long-lived stable disks over the lifetime of the AGB\ndonor star. The disks have masses of a few times 10^{-5}-10^{-3} M_sun, with\nsurface density and temperature profiles that follow broken power-laws. The\ntotal mass in the disk scales approximately linearly with the viscosity\nparameter used. Roughly 50% to 80% of the mass falling into the disk accretes\nonto the central star; the rest flows out through the outer edge of the disk\ninto the stellar wind of the primary. For systems with large accretion rates,\nthe secondary accretes as much as 0.1 M_sun. When the secondary is a white\ndwarf, accretion naturally leads to nova and supernova eruptions.

Since metal-poor planets are less dense and have larger radii than\nmetal-rich planets of the same mass, one might expect that metal-poor stars\nhost a higher proportion of gas giants with large radii than metal-rich stars.\nHere I present evidence for a negative correlation at the 2.3-sigma level\nbetween eclipse depth and stellar metallicity in the Kepler gas giant\ncandidates. Based on Kendall's tau statistics, the probability that eclipse\ndepth depends on star metallicity is 0.981. The correlation is consistent with\nplanets orbiting low-metallicity stars being, on average, larger in comparison\nwith their host stars than planets orbiting metal-rich stars. Furthermore,\nsince metal-rich stars have smaller radii than metal-poor stars of the same\nmass and age, a uniform population of planets should show a rise in median\neclipse depth with [M/H].

We include a formulation of convective damping motivated by\nnumerical simulations of the interaction between convection and periodic shear\nflows. We find that convective viscosity is likely strong enough to stabilize\nradial pulsations whenever nuclear-burning (the epsilon-mechanism) is the\ndominant source of driving. This suggests that massive main sequence stars with\nZ <~ 2 x 10^-3 are pulsationally stable and are unlikely to experience\npulsation-driven mass loss on the main sequence. These conclusions are,\nhowever, sensitive to the form of the convective viscosity and highlight the\nneed for further high-resolution simulations of the convection-oscillation\ninteraction. For more metal-rich stars (Z >~ 2 x 10^-3), the dominant\npulsational driving arises due to the kappa-mechanism arising from the\niron-bump in opacity and is strong enough to overcome convective damping.

The primary scientific goal of the network is to\ndiscover and characterize a large number of transiting extrasolar planets,\nreaching out to long periods and down to small planetary radii. HATSouth\nachieves this by monitoring extended areas on the sky, deriving high precision\nlight curves for a large number of stars, searching for the signature of\nplanetary transits, and confirming planetary candidates with larger telescopes.\nHATSouth employs 6 telescope units spread over 3 locations with large longitude\nseparation in the southern hemisphere (Las Campanas Observatory, Chile; HESS\nsite, Namibia; Siding Spring Observatory, Australia). Each of the HATSouth\nunits holds four 0.18m diameter f/2.8 focal ratio telescope tubes on a common\nmount producing an 8.2x8.2 arcdeg field, imaged using four 4Kx4K CCD cameras\nand Sloan r filters, to give a pixel scale of 3.7 arcsec/pixel. The HATSouth\nnetwork is capable of continuously monitoring 128 square arc-degrees. We\npresent the technical details of the network, summarize operations, and present\nweather statistics for the 3 sites. On average each of the 6 HATSouth units has\nconducted observations on ~500 nights over a 2-year time period, yielding a\ntotal of more than 1million science frames at 4 minute integration time, and\nobserving ~10.65 hours per day on average.

To track these\ninteractions we have conducted a suite of high-resolution (1500^3 effective) 3D\nsimulations that follow the evolution of individual clumps as they move into\nmolecular gas. Even at these high resolutions, our simulations do not quite\nachieve numerical convergence, due to the challenge of properly resolving the\nsmall-scale mixing of ejecta and molecular gas, although they do allow some\nrobust conclusions to be drawn. Isotropically exploding ejecta do not penetrate\ninto the molecular cloud, but, if cooling is properly accounted for, clumpy\nejecta penetrate to distances ~10^18 cm and mix effectively with star-forming\nmolecular gas. The ~2 M_\\odot high-metallicity ejecta from a core-collapse SN\nis likely to mix with ~2 \\times 10^4 M_\\odot of molecular gas. Thus all stars\nforming late (~5 Myr) in the evolution of an HII region may be contaminated by\nSN ejecta at a level ~10^-4. This level of contamination is consistent with the\nabundances of short-lived radionuclides and possibly some stable isotopic\nshifts in the early solar system, and is potentially consistent with the\nobserved variability in stellar elemental abundances.

This\nstudy is motivated by i) the potential to find bright warm disks around planet\nhost stars, ii) a need to characterise the distribution of rare warm disks, and\niii) the possible identification of candidates for discovering transiting dust\nconcentrations. We find about 8,000 stars that have excess emission, mostly at\n12um. The positions of these stars correlate with the 100um background level so\nmost of the flux measurements associated with these excesses are spurious. We\nidentify 271 stars with plausible excesses by making a 5MJy/sr cut in the IRAS\n100um emission. The number counts of these excesses, at both 12 and 22um, have\nthe same distribution as extra-Galactic number counts. Thus, although some\nexcesses may be circumstellar, most can be explained as chance alignments with\nbackground galaxies. The one exception is a 22um excess associated with a\nrelatively nearby A-type star that we were able to confirm because the disk\noccurrence rate is independent of stellar distance. Despite our low detection\nrate, these results place valuable upper limits on the distribution of large\nmid-infrared excesses; e.g. fewer than 1:1000 stars have 12um excesses (F_\nobs/F_star) larger than a factor of five. In contrast to previous studies, we\nfind no evidence for disks around 1790 stars with candidate planets (we\nattribute one significant 12um excess to a background galaxy), and no evidence\nthat the disk distribution around planet hosts is different to the bulk\npopulation.

We compare all six theories with MHD\nsimulations, covering cloud masses of 300 to 4x10^6 solar masses and Mach\nnumbers M = 3 to 50 and M_A = 1 to infinity, with solenoidal (b=1/3), mixed\n(b=0.4) and compressive turbulent (b=1) forcings. We find that the SFR\nincreases by a factor of four between M=5 and 50 for compressive forcing and\nalpha_vir~1. Comparing forcing parameters, we see that the SFR is more than 10x\nhigher with compressive than solenoidal forcing for Mach 10 simulations. The\nSFR and fragmentation are both reduced by a factor of two in strongly\nmagnetized, trans-Alfvenic turbulence compared to hydrodynamic turbulence. All\nsimulations are fit simultaneously by the multi-freefall KM and multi-freefall\nPN theories within a factor of two over two orders of magnitude in SFR. The\nsimulated SFRs cover the range and correlation of SFR column density with gas\ncolumn density observed in Galactic clouds, and agree well for star formation\nefficiencies SFE = 1% to 10% and local efficiencies epsilon = 0.3 to 0.7 due to\nfeedback.

The most widely used analytic model\nfor this inversion comes from Budding (1977) and Dorren (1987), who considered\ncircular, grey starspots for a linearly limb darkened star. In this work, we\nextend the model to be more suitable in the analysis of high precision\nphotometry, such as that by Kepler.

As their spectra are very\nsimilar the parameters that we obtained by the spectral analyses hardly differ.\nDespite their late spectral subtype, we found relatively high stellar\ntemperatures of 63 kK. The wind composition is dominated by helium, while\nhydrogen is depleted to 25 per cent by mass.\n  Because of their location in the Scutum-Centaurus arm, WR\\,120bb and\nWR\\,120bc appear highly reddened, $A_{K_{\\rm s}} \\approx 2$ mag. We adopt a\ncommon distance of 5.8\\,kpc to both stars, which complies with the typical\nabsolute $K$-band magnitude for the WN9h subtype of -6.5 mag, is consistent\nwith their observed extinction based on comparison with other massive stars in\nthe region, and allows for the possibility that their shells are interacting\nwith each other. This leads to luminosities of $\\log(L/L_\\odot) = 5.66$ and\n5.54 for WR\\,120bb and WR\\,120bc, with large uncertainties due to the adopted\ndistance.\n  The values of the luminosities of WR\\,120bb and WR\\,120bc imply that the\nimmediate precursors of both stars were red supergiants (RSG). This implies in\nturn that the circumstellar shells associated with WR\\,120bb and WR\\,120bc were\nformed by interaction between the WR wind and the dense material shed during\nthe preceding RSG phase. \n\n"}

The Galactic tidal forces acting on planets scale\ninversely with radius in the Galaxy and so are much greater in the inner Galaxy\nthan in the Solar neighbourhood. Within a range of 3.5 to 10 kpc, the vertical\ntide from the Galactic disc is predominant. Interior to 3.5 kpc, the effects of\nthe Galactic bulge cannot be neglected and the in-plane tidal components are as\nimportant as the vertical ones. Here, we quantify the orbital changes induced\nby these tides. We find that the greatest perturbations occur when the\nplanetary orbit is severely misaligned to the parent star's orbit. When both\nplanes are perpendicular, the eccentricity of the planet is driven to unity,\nalthough the semimajor axis is secularly unaffected. When both planes are\ncoincident, the effect from Galactic tides is minimized, but remains non-zero.\nIn these cases, we provide estimates for the survival times, as well as the\nminimum baseline eccentricity variation for all Milky Way exoplanets as a\nfunction of Galactic parameters. Inclinations similar to the Solar System's\n(about 60 degrees) can easily cause eccentric Neptunes (at about 30 AU) around\nhost stars deep within the Galactic bulge (within 50 pc) to experience\neccentricity variations of several tenths, and cause the exoplanets with the\nwidest-known separations (at about 1000 AU) to experience similar variations in\nthe Galactic disc. These variations occur on timescales of a few Gyr, a\nfraction of a typical main sequence lifetime. \n\n"}

Our model is based on measurements indicating that the specific accretion\nrate distribution is a universal function across a wide range of host stellar\nmass with slope gamma_1 = -0.65 and an overall normalization that evolves with\nredshift. We test several simple assumptions to extend this model to high\nspecific accretion rates (beyond the measurements) and compare the predictions\nfor the XLF with the observed data.

It\nhas been seen as improbable that we would find planets in such a small final\nfraction of their lives. The favored solution has been that the tidal\ndissipation is much weaker than expected, which would mean that the final\ninfall would be a larger fraction of the planets' life. We find no reason to\nexclude the explanation that a small number of planets are continuously sent\nmigrating inwards such that these planets indeed are in the last fraction of\ntheir lives. Following the observation that the distribution of medium planets\ndisfavors tidal dissipation being significantly weaker than has been found from\nobservations of binary stars, we now show that the numbers of planets in such a\n\"flow\" of excess planets migrating inwards is low enough that even depletion of\nthe three-day pileup is a plausible source.

Multi-planet\nevolved systems are particularly complex because of the mutual interactions\nbetween the planets. Here, we study the underlying dynamical mechanisms which\ncan incite planetary escape in two-planet post-main sequence systems. Stellar\nmass loss alone is unlikely to be rapid and high enough to eject planets at\ntypically-observed separations. However, the combination of mass loss and\nplanet-planet interactions can prompt a shift from stable to chaotic regions of\nphase space. Consequently, when mass loss ceases, the unstable configuration\nmay cause escape. By assuming a constant stellar mass loss rate, we utilize\nmaps of dynamical stability to illustrate the distribution of regular and\nchaotic trajectories in phase space. We show that chaos can drive the planets\nto undergo close encounters, leading to the ejection of one planet. Stellar\nmass loss can trigger the transition of a planetary system from a stable to\nchaotic configuration, subsequently causing escape.

We explore gravitational interactions with\na distant planetary companion as a possible cause of these non-zero\neccentricities. For simplicity, we focus on the evolution of a planar\ntwo-planet system subject to slow eccentricity damping and provide an intuitive\ninterpretation of the resulting long-term orbital evolution. We show that\ndissipation shifts the two normal eigenmode frequencies and eccentricity ratios\nof the standard secular theory slightly, and that each mode decays at its own\nrate. Tidal damping of the eccentricities drives orbits to transition between\nperiods of pericenter circulation and libration, and the planetary system\nsettles into a locked state where the pericenters are nearly aligned or\nanti-aligned. Once in the locked state, the eccentricities of the two orbits\ndecrease very slowly due to tides rather than at the much more rapid\nsingle-planet rate, and thus eccentric orbits, even for close-in planets, can\noften survive much longer than the age of the system. Assuming that an observed\nclose-in planet on an elliptical orbit is apsidally-locked to a more distant,\nand perhaps unseen companion, we provide a constraint on the mass, semi-major\naxis, and eccentricity of the companion. We find the observed two-planet system\nHAT-P-13 might be in just such an apsidally-locked state, with parameters that\nobey our constraint well. We also survey close-in single planets, and found\nthat none provide compelling evidence for unseen companions. Instead, we\nsuspect that (1) orbits are circular, (2) tidal damping rates are slower than\nour assumption, or (3) a recent event has excited these eccentricities.

For this class of models, we develop analytic\napproximations to specify the final orbital elements for planets that remain\nbound after the epoch of mass loss, and find the conditions required for the\nplanets to become unbound.

The fragmentation of self-gravitating\nprotostellar discs into gravitationally bound embryos - with masses of a few to\ntens of Jupiter masses, at semi major axes above 30 - 40 au - is followed by\ngrain sedimentation inside the embryo, radial migration towards the central\nstar and tidal disruption of the embryo's upper layers. The properties of the\nresultant object depends sensitively on the timescales upon which each process\noccurs. Therefore, GI followed by tidal downsizing can theoretically produce\nobjects spanning a large mass range, from terrestrial planets to giant planets\nand brown dwarfs. Whether such objects can be formed in practice, and what\nproportions of the observed population they would represent, requires a more\ninvolved statistical analysis.\n  We present a simple population synthesis model of star and planet formation\nvia GI and tidal downsizing. We couple a semi-analytic model of protostellar\ndisc evolution to analytic calculations of fragmentation, initial embryo mass,\ngrain growth and sedimentation, embryo migration and tidal disruption. While\nthere are key pieces of physics yet to be incorporated, it represents a first\nstep towards a mature statistical model of GI and tidal downsizing as a mode of\nstar and planet formation.\n  We show results from four runs of the population synthesis model, varying the\nopacity law and the strength of migration, as well as investigating the effect\nof disc truncation during the fragmentation process. Our early results suggest\nthat GI plus tidal downsizing is not the principal mode of planet formation,\nbut remains an excellent means of forming gas giant planets, brown dwarfs and\nlow mass stars at large semimajor axes.

Results: We find a cyclic behavior in X-rays very similar to the\ncontemporaneous chromospheric cycle. The continuous chromospheric monitoring\nfor more than three cycle lengths shows a trend toward decreasing amplitude,\napparently modulated by a longer term trend. The second cycle is disrupted\nprior to reaching its maximum, followed by a brief episode of chaotic\nvariability before the cyclic behavior resumes, only to be disrupted again\nafter slightly more than one cycle.

For the\nlatter process, a number of numerical simulations have been performed in recent\nyears, but a fully parameter-independent understanding has not been yet\nestablished. In this study, we present simple scaling relations for the\nplanetesimal stirring rate in turbulence driven by magnetorotational\ninstability (MRI), taking into account the stabilization of MRI due to Ohmic\nresistivity. We begin with order-of-magnitude estimates of the\nturbulence-induced gravitational force acting on solid bodies and associated\ndiffusion coefficients for their orbital elements.

We find\nthat this critical surface density scales linearly with X-ray luminosity,\nincreases with inner hole radius and decreases with stellar mass and we develop\nan analytic model that reproduces these results.\n  This surface density criterion is then used to determine the evolutionary\nstate of protoplanetary discs at the point that they become unstable to\ndestruction by thermal sweeping. We find that transition discs created by\nphotoevaporation will undergo thermal sweeping when their inner holes reach\n20-40 AU, implying that transition discs with large holes and no accretion\n(which were previously a predicted outcome of the later stages of all flavours\nof photoevaporation model) will not form.\n  We emphasise that the surface density criteria that we have developed apply\nto all situations where the disc develops an inner hole that is optically thin\nto X-rays. It thus applies not only to the case of holes originally created by\nphotoevaporation but also to holes formed, for example, by the tidal influence\nof planets. \n\n"}

In analogy to the flux of cosmic rays that impact the Earth,\nwhich is inversely modulated with the non-axisymmetric component of the total\nopen solar magnetic flux, we conclude that planets orbiting M dwarf stars like\nDT~Vir, DS~Leo and GJ~182, which have significant non-axisymmetric field\ncomponents, should be the more efficiently shielded from galactic cosmic rays,\neven if the planets lack a protective thick atmosphere/large magnetosphere of\ntheir own. \n\n"}

Due to its design, contamination from eclipsing\nbinaries, variable stars, and other transiting planets results in a significant\nnumber of these signals being false positives. This directly affects the\ndetermination of the occurrence rate of Earth-like planets in our Galaxy, as\nwell as other planet population statistics. In order to detect as many of these\nfalse positives as possible, we perform ephemeris matching among all transiting\nplanet, eclipsing binary, and variable star sources. We find that 685 Kepler\nObjects of Interest - 12% of all those analyzed - are false positives as a\nresult of contamination, due to 409 unique parent sources. Of these, 118 have\nnot previously been identified by other methods. We estimate that ~35% of KOIs\nare false positives due to contamination, when performing a first-order\ncorrection for observational bias. Comparing single-planet candidate KOIs to\nmulti-planet candidate KOIs, we find an observed false positive fraction due to\ncontamination of 16% and 2.4% respectively, bolstering the existing evidence\nthat multi-planet KOIs are significantly less likely to be false positives.

Studies of\nstripped-envelope supernovae, in particular, require binary mass transfer.\nDramatic examples of eruptive mass loss are seen in Type IIn supernovae, which\nhave massive shells ejected just a few years before core collapse. The shifting\nemphasis from steady winds to episodic mass loss is a major change for\nlow-metallicity regions, since eruptions and binary mass transfer are less\nsensitive to metallicity.

Wind\n  Solutions at the Inner Disk Abstract: The gas dynamics of protoplanetary disks (PPDs) is largely controlled by\nnon-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects including Ohmic resistivity, the\nHall effect and ambipolar diffusion. Among these the role of the Hall effect is\nthe least explored and most poorly understood. We have included all three\nnon-ideal MHD effects in a self-consistent manner to investigate the role of\nthe Hall effect on PPD gas dynamics using local shearing-box simulations. In\nthis first paper, we focus on the inner region of PPDs, where previous studies\nexcluding the Hall effect have revealed that the inner disk up to ~10 AU is\nlargely laminar, with accretion driven by a magnetocentrifugal wind. We confirm\nthis basic picture and show that the Hall effect introduces modest\nmodifications to the wind solutions, depending on the polarity of the\nlarge-scale poloidal magnetic field B_0 threading the disk. When B_0.Omega>0,\nthe horizontal magnetic field is strongly amplified toward the disk interior,\nleading to a stronger disk wind (by ~50% or less in terms of the wind-driven\naccretion rate). The enhanced horizontal field also leads to much stronger\nlarge-scale Maxwell stress (magnetic braking) that contributes to a\nconsiderable fraction of the wind-driven accretion rate. When B_0.Omega<0, the\nhorizontal magnetic field is reduced, leading to a weaker disk wind (by ~20%)\nand negligible magnetic braking. Moreover, we find that when B_0.Omega>0, the\nlaminar region extends farther to ~15 AU before the magneto-rotational\ninstability sets in, while for B_0.Omega<0, the laminar region extends only to\n~3-5 AU for a typical PPD accretion rates. Scaling relations for the wind\nproperties, especially the wind-driven accretion rate, are provided for aligned\nand anti-aligned field geometries. Issues with the symmetry of the wind\nsolutions and grain abundance are also discussed. \n\n"}

Large deviations between the abundances of\nthe host star and its gas giants seem likely to occur if the planet formation\nfollows the core-accretion scenario. These deviations stem from the separate\nevolution of gas and dust in the disk, where the dust forms the planet cores,\nfollowed by the final run-away accretion of the left-over gas. ProDiMo\nprotoplanetary disk models are used to predict the chemical evolution of gas\nand ice in the midplane. We find that cosmic rays play a crucial role in slowly\nun-blocking the CO, where the liberated oxygen forms water, which then freezes\nout quickly. Therefore, the C/O ratio in the gas phase is found to gradually\nincrease with time, in a region bracketed by the water and CO ice-lines.

Here I\ndemonstrate that equilibrium tides raised by a planet on its star can account\nfor three observed spin-orbit alignment trends: the aligned orbits of hot\nJupiters orbiting cool stars, the planetary mass cut-off for retrograde\nplanets, and the stratification by planet mass of cool host stars' rotation\nfrequencies. The first trend can be caused by strong versus weak magnetic\nbraking (the Kraft break), rather than realignment of the star's convective\nenvelope versus the entire star. The second trend can result from a small\neffective stellar moment of inertia participating in the tidal realignment in\nhot stars, enabling massive retrograde planets to partially realign to become\nprograde. The third trend is attributable to higher mass planets more\neffectively counteracting braking to spin up their stars. Both hot and cool\nstar require a small effective stellar moment of inertia participating in the\ntidal realignment, e.g., an outer layer weakly coupled to the interior. I\ndemonstrate via Monte Carlo that this model can match the observed trends and\ndistributions of sky-projected misalignments and stellar rotation frequencies.\nI discuss implications for inferring hot Jupiter migration mechanisms from\nobliquities, emphasizing that even hot stars do not constitute a pristine\nsample. \n\n"}

Hydrodynamic simulations\nshow a transition from SL to AS rotation as the influence of rotation on\nconvection is reduced, but the opposite transition occurs at a different point\nin the parameter space. The system is bistable, i.e., SL and AS rotation\nprofiles can both be stable. We study the effect of a dynamo-generated magnetic\nfield on the large-scale flows, particularly on the possibility of bistable\nbehavior of differential rotation. We solve the hydromagnetic equations\nnumerically in a rotating spherical shell for a set of different radiative\nconductivities controlling the relative importance of convection. In agreement\nwith earlier findings, our models display SL rotation profiles when the\nrotational influence on convection is strong and a transition to AS when the\nrotational influence decreases. We find that dynamo-generated magnetic fields\nhelp to produce SL differential rotation compared to the hydrodynamic\nsimulations. We do not observe any bistable states of differential rotation. In\nthe AS cases we get coherent single-cell meridional circulation, whereas in SL\ncases we get multi-cellular patterns. In both cases, we obtain poleward\ncirculation near the surface with a magnitude close to that observed in the\nSun. Moreover, both differential rotation and meridional circulation have\nsignificant magnetic cycle-related variations that are similar in strength to\nthose of the Sun.

Our\napproach is to use the full kinetics model to survey the parameter space with\neffective temperatures between 500 K and 1100 K. In all of these worlds\nequilibrium chemistry favors CH4 over CO in the parts of the atmosphere that\ncan be seen from Earth, but in most disequilibrium favors CO. The small surface\ngravity of a planet strongly discriminates against CH4 when compared to an\notherwise comparable brown dwarf. If vertical mixing is like Jupiter's, the\ntransition from methane to CO occurs at 500 K in a planet. Sluggish vertical\nmixing can raise this to 600 K; but clouds or more vigorous vertical mixing\ncould lower this to 400 K. The comparable thresholds in brown dwarfs are\n$1100\\pm100$ K. Ammonia is also sensitive to gravity, but unlike CH4/CO, the\nNH3/N2 ratio is insensitive to mixing, which makes NH3 a potential proxy for\ngravity.

We find that around R=5AU, the\nsystem launches a laminar/weakly turbulent magnetocentrifugal wind when the net\nvertical field Bz is not too weak, as expected. Moreover, the wind is able to\nachieve and maintain a configuration with reflection symmetry at disk midplane.\nThe case with anti-aligned field polarity (Omega. Bz<0) is more susceptible to\nthe MRI when Bz drops, leading to an outflow oscillating in radial directions\nand very inefficient angular momentum transport. At the outer disk around and\nbeyond R=30AU, the system shows vigorous MRI turbulence in the surface layer\ndue to far-UV ionization, which efficiently drives disk accretion. The Hall\neffect affects the stability of the midplane region to the MRI, leading to\nstrong/weak Maxwell stress for aligned/anti-aligned field polarities.\nNevertheless, the midplane region is only very weakly turbulent.

Based on a hybrid approach\nthat combines frequency-dependent ray-tracing for stellar irradiation with\nnon-equilibrium flux limited diffusion, we solve the equations of radiation\nhydrodynamics while preserving the directionality of the stellar irradiation.\nThe implementation permits simulations in Cartesian, cylindrical, and spherical\ncoordinates, on both uniform and adaptive grids.\n  Results. We present several hydrostatic and hydrodynamic radiation tests\nwhich validate our implementation on uniform and adaptive grids as appropriate,\nincluding benchmarks specifically designed for protoplanetary disks. Our\nresults demonstrate that the combination of a hybrid radiation algorithm with\nAZEuS is an effective tool for radiation hydrodynamics studies, and produces\nresults which are competitive with other astrophysical radiation hydrodynamics\ncodes. \n\n"}

We hypothesize that the\nin-situ breakup of small bodies such as asteroids spun to fission during the\ngiant branch phases of stellar evolution provides an important contribution to\nthis debris. The YORP effect, which arises from radiation pressure, accelerates\nthe spin rate of asymmetric asteroids, which can eventually shear themselves\napart. This pressure is maintained and enhanced around dying stars because the\noutward push of an asteroid due to stellar mass loss is insignificant compared\nto the resulting stellar luminosity increase. Consequently, giant star\nradiation will destroy nearly all bodies with radii in the range 100 m - 10 km\nthat survive their parent star's main sequence lifetime within a distance of\nabout 7 au; smaller bodies are spun apart to their strongest, competent\ncomponents.

We found that the infall of matter\nfrom the external environment can significantly alter the disk properties as\ncompared to those seen in the isolated model. Depending on the magnitude and\ndirection of rotation of the external environment, a variety of disks can form\nincluding compact (<= 200 AU) ones shrinking in size due to infall of external\nmatter with low angular momentum, as well as extended disks forming due to\ninfall of external matter with high angular momentum. The former are usually\nstable against gravitational fragmentation, while the latter are prone to\nfragmentation and formation of stellar systems with sub-stellar/very-low-mass\ncompanions. In the case of counterrotating external environment, very compact\n(< 5 AU) and short-lived (<= a few * 10^5 yr) disks can form when infalling\nmaterial has low angular momentum. The most interesting case is found for the\ninfall of counterrotating external material with high angular momentum, leading\nto the formation of counterrotating inner and outer disks separated by a deep\ngap at a few tens AU. The gap migrates inward due to accretion of the inner\ndisk onto the protostar, turns into a central hole, and finally disappears\ngiving way to the outer strongly gravitationally unstable disk.

The post-accretion stars spend their core helium-burning phase as blue\nsupergiants (BSGs), and many examples are consistent with being LBVs at the\ntime of core collapse. Other examples are yellow supergiants at explosion. We\nalso investigate whether such post-accretion stars may explode successfully\nafter core collapse. The final core properties of post-accretion models are\nbroadly similar to those of single stars with the same initial mass as the\npre-merger primary star.

The tilt\nangle between the circumbinary disk plane and the binary orbital plane is\nassumed to be very small. We find that there is a radius within/beyond which\nthe circumbinary disk is unstable to radiation-driven warping, depending on the\ndisk density and temperature gradient indices. This marginally stable warping\nradius is very sensitive to viscosity parameters, a fiducial disk radius and\nthe temperature measured there, the stellar luminosity, and the disk surface\ndensity at a radius where the disk changes from the optically thick to thin for\nthe irradiation from the central stars. On the other hand, it is insensitive to\nthe orbital eccentricity and binary irradiation parameter, which is a function\nof the binary mass ratio and luminosity of each star. Since the tidal torques\ncan suppress the warping in the inner part of the circumbinary disk, the disk\nstarts to be warped in the outer part.

However, most studies of tidal downsizing end\nwhen the protostellar disc disperses, while the system is embedded in its\nparent star-forming region. To compare disc fragment descendants with exoplanet\nand brown dwarf observations, the subsequent dynamical evolution must be\nexplored.\n  We carry out N-Body integrations of fragment-fragment scattering in\nmulti-object star systems, and star systems embedded in substructured clusters.\nIn both cases, we use initial conditions generated by population synthesis\nmodels of tidal downsizing.\n  The scattering simulations produce a wide range of eccentricities.

WASP-85 b orbits its host star every 2.66 days,\nand has a mass of 1.25 M_Jup and a radius of 1.25 R_Jup. The host star is of G5\nspectral type, with magnitude V = 11.2, and lies 141 pc distant. The system has\na K-dwarf binary companion, WASP-85 B, at a separation of ~1.5\". The close\nproximity of this companion leads to contamination of our photometry,\ndecreasing the apparent transit depth that we account for during our analysis.\nAnalysis of the Ca II H+K lines shows strong emission that implies that both\nbinary components are strongly active. WASP-116 b is a warm, mildly inflated\nsuper-Saturn, with a mass of 0.59 M_Jup and a radius of 1.43 R_Jup. It was\ndiscovered orbiting a metal-poor ([Fe/H] = -0.28 dex), cool (T_eff = 5950 K) G0\ndwarf every 6.61 days. WASP-149 b is a typical hot Jupiter, orbiting a G6 dwarf\nwith a period of 1.33 days.

Furthermore, this probability rapidly approaches zero at increasing\norbital period. Therefore transit surveys have been predominantly limited to\nthe inner parts of exoplanetary systems. Here we demonstrate how circumbinary\nplanets allow us to beat these unfavourable odds. By incorporating the geometry\nand the three-body dynamics of circumbinary systems, we analytically derive the\nprobability of transitability, a configuration where the binary and planet\norbits overlap on the sky. We later show that this is equivalent to the transit\nprobability, but at an unspecified point in time. This probability, at its\nminimum, is always higher than for single star cases. In addition, it is an\nincreasing function with mutual inclination. By applying our analytical\ndevelopment to eclipsing binaries, we deduce that transits are highly probable,\nand in some case guaranteed. For example, a circumbinary planet revolving at 1\nAU around a 0.3 AU eclipsing binary is certain to eventually transit - a 100%\nprobability - if its mutual inclination is greater than 0.6 deg.

Analytical perturbation theory predicts the\nexistence of nested circumbinary orbits that are generalizations of circular\npaths around a single star. These orbits have forced eccentric motion aligned\nwith the binary as well as higher frequency oscillations, yet they do not\ncross, even in the presence of massive disks and perturbations from large\nplanets. For this reason, dissipative gas and planetesimals can settle onto\nthese \"most circular\" orbits, facilitating the growth of protoplanets. Outside\na region close to the binary where orbits are generally unstable, circumbinary\nplanets form in much the same way as their cousins around a single star. Here,\nwe review the theory and confirm its predictions with a suite of representative\nsimulations. We then consider the circumbinary planets discovered with NASA's\nKepler satellite. These Neptune- and Jupiter-size planets, or their\nplanetesimal precursors, may have migrated inward to reach their observed\norbits, since their current positions are outside of unstable zones caused by\noverlapping resonances. In situ formation without migration seems less likely,\nonly because the surface density of the protoplanetary disks must be\nimplausibly high. Otherwise, the circumbinary environment is friendly to planet\nformation, and we expect that many Earth-like \"Tatooines\" will join the growing\ncensus of circumbinary planets. \n\n"}

Confronted with a transit\nlightcurve, some authors fix the parameters of these laws, the so-called\nlimb-darkening coefficients (LDCs), while others prefer to let them float in\nthe lightcurve fitting procedure. Which of these is the best strategy, however,\nis still unclear, as well as how and by how much each of these can bias the\nretrieved transit parameters. In this work we attempt to clarify those points\nby first re-calculating these LDCs, comparing them to measured values from\nKepler transit lightcurves using an algorithm that takes into account\nuncertainties in both the geometry of the transit and the parameters of the\nstellar host. We show there are significant departures from predicted model\nvalues, suggesting that our understanding of limb-darkening still needs to\nimprove. Then, we show through simulations that if one uses the quadratic\nlimb-darkening law to parametrize limb-darkening, fixing and fitting the LDCs\ncan lead to significant biases -up to $\\sim 3\\%$ and $\\sim 1\\%$ in $R_p/R_*$,\nrespectively-, which are important for several confirmed and candidate\nexoplanets.

An outstanding problem with the\nexisting formation models is that the distribution of orbital inclinations they\npredicted is narrower than the one inferred from observations.

This gas envelope, if more massive\nthan a few percent of the core (with a mass below $10 M_\\oplus$), has a cooling\ntime that is much longer than the time-scale on which the planet exits the\ndisk. As such, it could not have contracted significantly from its original\nsize, of order the Bondi radius. So a newly exposed proto-planet would be\nlosing mass via a Parker wind that is catalyzed by the stellar continuum\nradiation. This represents an intermediate stage of mass-loss, occurring soon\nafter the disc has dispersed, but before the EUV/X-ray driven photoevaporation\nbecomes relevant. The surface mass-loss induces a mass movement within the\nenvelope that advects internal heat outward. As a result, the planet atmosphere\nrapidly cools down and contracts, until it has reached a radius of order $0.1$\nBondi radius, at which time the mass-loss effectively shuts down. Within a\nmillion years after the disk disperses, we find a planet that has only about\nten percent of its original envelope, and a Kelvin-Helmholtz time that is much\nlonger than its actual age.

The size of the disk is\nsignificantly affected by a simple difference in the inherent properties of the\nprestellar core, namely whether the rotation vector and the magnetic field are\nparallel or anti- parallel.

Tidal dissipation in stellar\nconvective envelopes is a key actor that shapes the orbital architecture of\nshort-period systems. Our objective is to understand and evaluate how tidal\ndissipation in the convective envelope of low-mass stars (from M to F types)\ndepends on their mass, evolutionary stage and rotation. Using a simplified\ntwo-layer assumption, we compute analytically the frequency-averaged tidal\ndissipation in their convective envelope. This dissipation is due to the\nconversion into heat of the kinetic energy of tidal non wave-like/equilibrium\nflow and inertial waves because of the viscous friction applied by turbulent\nconvection. Using grids of stellar models allows us to study the variation of\nthe dissipation as a function of stellar mass and age on the Pre-Main-Sequence\nand on the Main-Sequence for stars with masses spanning from $0.4$ to\n$1.4M_{\\odot}$. As shown by observations, tidal dissipation in stars varies\nover several orders of magnitude as a function of stellar mass, age and\nrotation. During their Pre-Main-Sequence, all low-mass stars have an increase\nof the frequency-averaged tidal dissipation for a fixed angular velocity in\ntheir convective envelope until they reach a critical aspect and mass ratios.\nNext, the dissipation evolves on the Main Sequence to an asymptotic value that\nbecomes maximum for $0.6M_{\\odot}$ K-type stars and that decreases by several\norders of magnitude with increasing stellar mass.

However, recent work has shown that in isothermal\ndiscs, a migrating protoplanet may also experience dynamical corotation torques\nthat scale with the planet drift rate. The aim of this study is to examine\nwhether dynamical corotation torques can also affect the migration of low-mass\nplanets in non-isothermal discs. We performed 2D radiative hydrodynamical\nsimulations to examine the orbital evolution outcome of migrating protoplanets\nas a function of disc mass. We find that a protoplanet can enter a fast\nmigration regime when it migrates in the direction set by the entropy-related\nhorseshoe drag and when the Toomre stability parameter is less than a threshold\nvalue below which the horseshoe region contracts into a tadpole-like region.

The observations of SR21 show a clear shift in the\nvisibility nulls, indicating radial variations of the inner edge of the cavity\nat the two wavelengths. Notable radial variations of the spectral index are\nalso detected for SR21 with values of $\\alpha_{\\rm{mm}}{\\sim}3.8-4.2$ in the\ninner region ($r<35$ AU) and $\\alpha_{\\rm{mm}}{\\sim}2.6-3.0$ outside. An\naxisymmetric ring (which we call the ring model) or a ring with the addition of\nan azimuthal Gaussian profile, for mimicking a vortex structure (which we call\nthe vortex model), is assumed for fitting the disk morphology. For SR21, the\nring model better fits the emission at 336GHz, conversely the vortex model\nbetter fits the 689GHz emission.

Here we explore this trend\nin more detail, checking how significant it is and seeking to find possible\nexplanations. We show that the trend is robust to variation of the composition\nand porosity of dust particles. For any assumed grain properties and stellar\nparameters, we suggest a recipe of how to estimate the \"true\" radius of a\nspatially unresolved debris disc, based solely on its spectral energy\ndistribution. The results of our collisional simulations are qualitatively\nconsistent with the trend, although additional effects may also be at work. In\nparticular, the lack of grains with small $s_\\text{min}/s_\\text{blow}$ for\nlower luminosity stars might be caused by the grain surface energy constraint\nthat should limit the size of the smallest collisional fragments. Also, a\nbetter agreement between the data and the collisional simulations is achieved\nwhen assuming debris discs of more luminous stars to have higher dynamical\nexcitation than those of less luminous primaries.

We find that M dwarf stars have 3.5 times more small planets\n(1.0-2.8 R_Earth) than main-sequence FGK stars, but two times fewer\nNeptune-sized and larger planets (>2.8 R_Earth). We find no systematic trend in\nthe planet size distribution between spectral types F, G, and K to explain the\nincreasing occurrence rates.

The overall higher planet occurrence\nrates around M stars are not consistent with the redistribution of the same\nmass into more, smaller planets. At the orbital periods and planet radii where\nKepler observations are complete for all spectral types, the average\nheavy-element mass locked up in exoplanets increases roughly inversely with\nstellar mass from 4 M_Earth in F stars to 5 M_Earth in G and K stars to 7\nM_Earth in M stars.

In\nparticular, the effects of stellar surface inhomogeneities on observed stellar\nradial velocities are extremely difficult to characterize, and thus developing\noptimal correction techniques to extract true stellar radial velocities is\nextremely challenging. In this paper, we present preliminary results of a solar\ntelescope built to feed full-disk sunlight into the HARPS-N spectrograph, which\nis in turn calibrated with an astro-comb. This setup enables long-term\nobservation of the Sun as a star with state-of-the-art sensitivity to radial\nvelocity changes. Over seven days of observing in 2014, we show an average\n50\\cms radial velocity rms over a few hours of observation.

The\nself-calibration method exploits the theoretical fact that the $EB$ and $TB$\ncross-spectra of the CMB vanish in the standard cosmological model, so any\ndetected $EB$ and $TB$ signals must be due to systematic errors.

By combining the new\nHerschel spectra with archival Spitzer-IRS spectroscopy, we retrieve a\nparameterized radial surface water vapor distribution from 0.1-100 AU using\ntwo-dimensional dust and line radiative transfer modeling. The surface water\ndistribution is modeled with a step model comprising of a constant inner and\nouter relative water abundance and a critical radius at which the surface water\nabundance is allowed to change. We find that the four disks have critical radii\nof $\\sim 3-11$ AU, at which the surface water abundance decreases by at least 5\norders of magnitude. The measured values for the critical radius are\nconsistently smaller than the location of the surface snow line, as predicted\nby the observed spectral energy distribution. This suggests that the sharp\ndrop-off of the surface water abundance is not solely due to the local\ngas-solid balance, but may also be driven by the de-activation of gas-phase\nchemical pathways to water below 300 K.

Here, I provide a light curve of 1338 Johnson B-band\nmagnitudes from 1890 to 1989 taken from archival photographic plates at\nHarvard. KIC8462852 displays a secular dimming at an average rate of\n0.164+-0.013 magnitudes per century. From the early-1890s to the late-1980s,\nKIC8462852 faded by 0.193+-0.030 mag. The decline is not an artifact because\nnearby check stars have closely flat light curves. This century-long dimming is\nunprecedented for any F-type main sequence star. Thus the Harvard light curve\nprovides the first confirmation (past the several dips seen in the Kepler light\ncurve alone) that KIC8462852 has anything unusual. The century-long dimming and\nthe day-long dips are both just extreme ends of a spectrum of timescales for\nunique dimming events. By Ockham's Razor, two such unique and similar effects\nare very likely produced by one physical mechanism. This one mechanism does not\nappear as any isolated catastrophic event in the last century, but rather must\nbe some ongoing process with continuous effects. Within the context of\ndust-occultation models, the century-long dimming trend requires 10^4 to 10^7\ntimes as much dust as for the deepest Kepler dip. Within the context of the\ncomet-family idea, the century-long dimming trend requires an estimated 648,000\ngiant comets (each with 200 km diameter) all orchestrated to pass in front of\nthe star within the last century. \n\n"}

III.\n  Carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars -- CEMP-s stars Abstract: Detailed spectroscopic studies of metal-poor halo stars have highlighted the\nimportant role of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars in understanding the\nearly production and ejection of carbon in the Galaxy and in identifying the\nprogenitors of the CEMP stars among the first stars formed after the Big Bang.\nRecent work has also classified the CEMP stars by absolute carbon abundance,\nA(C), into high- and low-C bands, mostly populated by binary and single stars,\nrespectively. Our aim is to determine the frequency and orbital parameters of\nbinary systems among the CEMP-s stars, which exhibit strong enhancements of\nneutron-capture elements associated with the s-process. This allows us to test\nwhether local mass transfer from a binary companion is necessary and sufficient\nto explain their dramatic carbon excesses. Eighteen of the 22 stars exhibit\nclear orbital motion, yielding a binary frequency of 82+-10%, while four stars\nappear to be single (18+-10%). We thus confirm that the binary frequency of\nCEMP-s stars is much higher than for normal metal-poor giants, but not 100% as\npreviously claimed. Secure orbits are determined for 11 of the binaries and\nprovisional orbits for six long-period systems (P > 3,000 days), and orbital\ncircularisation time scales are discussed. The conventional scenario of local\nmass transfer from a former AGB binary companion does appear to account for the\nchemical composition of most CEMP-s stars. However, the excess of C and\ns-process elements in some single CEMP-s stars was apparently transferred to\ntheir natal clouds by an external (distant) source. This finding has important\nimplications for our understanding of carbon enrichment in the early Galactic\nhalo and some high-redshift DLA systems, and of the mass loss from extremely\nmetal-poor AGB stars.

A growing body of research\nsuggests that small particles (\"pebbles\") continually drift inward through the\ndisk. If a fraction of drifting pebbles is trapped at the inner edge of the\ndisk a several Earth-mass core can quickly grow. Subsequently, the core may\nmigrate outward beyond the snow line via planet-disk interactions. Of course,\nto reach the outer Solar System Jupiter's core must traverse the terrestrial\nplanet-forming region.\n  We use N-body simulations including synthetic forces from an underlying\ngaseous disk to study how the outward migration of Jupiter's core sculpts the\nterrestrial zone. If the outward migration is fast (Tmig~10^4 years), the core\nsimply migrates past resident planetesimals and planetary embryos. However, if\nits migration is slower (Tmig~10^5 years) the core removes solids from the\ninner disk by shepherding objects in mean motion resonances.

Abstract: Brown dwarfs straddle the mass range transition from planetary to stellar\nobjects. There is a relative paucity of brown dwarfs companions around FGKM\nstars compared to exoplanets for orbital periods less than a few years, but\nmost of the short-period brown dwarf companions fully characterised by transits\nand radial velocities are found around F-type stars. We examine the hypothesis\nthat brown dwarf companions could not survive on close orbit around stars with\nimportant convective envelopes because the tides and angular momentum loss\nthrough magnetic breaking should lead to a rapid orbital decay and quick\nengulfment of the companion. We use a classical Skumanich-type braking law, and\nconstant time-lag tidal theory to assess the characteristic timescale for\norbital decay for the brown dwarf mass range as a function of the host\nproperties. We find that F-type stars may host massive companions for a\nsignificantly longer time than G-type stars for a given orbital period, which\nmay explain the paucity of G-type hosts for brown dwarfs with orbital period\nless than 5 days. On the other hand, we show that the small radius of early\nM-type stars contributes to orbital decay timescales that are only half those\nof F-type stars, despite their more efficient tidal dissipation and magnetic\nbraking. For fully convective later type M-dwarfs, orbital decay timescales\ncould be orders of magnitude greater than for F-type stars. For orbital periods\ngreater than 10 days, brown dwarf occurrence should largely be unaffected by\ntidal decay, whatever the mass of the host. On closer orbital periods, the\nrapid engulfment of massive companions could explain the lack of G and K-type\nhosts in the sample of known systems with transiting brown dwarfs. However, the\npaucity of M-type hosts can not be an effect of tidal decay alone, but may be\nthe result of a selection effect in the sample and/or the formation mechanism. \n\n"}

Comparisons of dust masses from\nprotoplanetary and debris disks have revealed a stark downturn in mass in\nmillimetre-sized grains around a stellar age of 10 Myr, ostensibly in the\n\"transition disk\" phase, suggesting a period of rapid accretion of such grains\nonto planetesimals. This rapid formation phase is in keeping with radionucleide\nstudies of Kuiper Belt Objects in the solar system. Importantly, this suggests\nthat any thermal gradients in the gas of disks of this era will be \"frozen in\"\nto the planetesimals as they rapidly accrete from the solids and ices in their\nvicinity. Measurements of radial gradients in thermal tracers such as DHO, DCN\nand other tracers can therefore provide insight into the nascent solar system's\nabudances.

A key factor governing the\nconditions near the star is the silicate sublimation front, which largely\ndetermines where the starlight is absorbed, and which is often called the inner\nrim. We present the first radiation hydrodynamical modeling of the sublimation\nfront in the disks around the young intermediate-mass stars called Herbig Ae\nstars.

The results compare well with\nradiation hydrostatic solutions, and prove to be dynamically stable.

We are developing a new atmospheric retrieval\nmethodology to help assess the science return and inform the instrument design\nfor such future missions, and ultimately interpret the resulting observations.\nOur retrieval technique employs a geometric albedo model coupled with both a\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo Ensemble Sampler (emcee) and a multimodal nested\nsampling algorithm (MultiNest) to map the posterior distribution.

Gravitational collapse of a\npre-stellar core forms both a central star and a protoplanetary disk. The\ncentral star grows by accretion from the disk, and irradiation by the central\nstar heats up the disk and generates thermal wind, which results in the disk\ndispersal. We calculate the evolution of protoplanetary disks from their parent\npre-stellar cores to dispersal of the disks. We find that the disk lifetimes of\ntypical pre-stellar cores are around 2--4 million years (Myr). A pre-stellar\ncore with high angular momentum forms a larger disk whose lifetime is long,\nwhile a disk around a X-ray luminous star has a short lifetime. Integrating the\ndisk lifetimes under various mass and angular velocity of prestellar cores and\nX-ray luminosities of young stellar objects, we obtain disk fraction at a given\nstellar age and mean lifetime of the disks. Our model indicates that the mean\nlifetime of protoplanetary disks is 3.7 Myr, which is consistent with the\nobservational estimate from young stellar clusters.

As of the past asymptotes, for a smooth transition only\nKasner regime in Gauss-Bonnet is an option. With that at hand, we are down only\nto two viable regimes -- \"pure\" Kasner regime (transition from high- to\nlow-energy Kasner regime) and a transition from high-energy Kasner to\nanisotropic exponential solution.

This is due, in\nlarge part, to the increase in use of small-aperture telescopes (< 20 cm) to\nsurvey large areas of the sky to milli-mag precision with rapid cadence. The\nvast majority of the planetary and binary systems studied to date consist of\nmain-sequence or evolved objects, leading to a dearth of knowledge of\nproperties at early times (< 50 Myr). Only a dozen binaries and one candidate\ntransiting Hot Jupiter are known among pre-main sequence objects, yet these are\nthe systems that can provide the best constraints on stellar formation and\nplanetary migration models. The deficiency in the number of well-characterized\nsystems is driven by the inherent and aperiodic variability found in\npre-main-sequence objects, which can mask and mimic eclipse signals. Hence, a\ndramatic increase in the number of young systems with high-quality observations\nis highly desirable to guide further theoretical developments. We have recently\ncompleted a photometric survey of 3 nearby (< 150 pc) and young (< 50 Myr)\nmoving groups with a small aperture telescope.

Efficient pebble\naccretion is likely to be unavoidable in transition disc dust traps, as the\nsize of the dust particles required for pebble accretion are those which are\nmost efficiently trapped in the transition disc dust trap. Rapid pebble\naccretion within the dust trap gives rise, not only to low-mass planets, but to\na large accretion luminosity.

Various works have investigated the influence of stellar\nfly-bys on disks, although many of them consider only the effects due to\nparabolic, coplanar encounters often for equal-mass stars, which is only a very\nspecial case.

Using an approximate analytic\ntreatment, we first show that drifting particles define a track in\nmetallicity--stopping time space whose only substantial dependence is on the\ndisk's angular momentum transport efficiency.

Gravitational fragmentation of circumstellar discs\nprovides a possible mechanism for the formation of such low-mass objects. The\nkinematic and binary properties of very low-mass objects formed through disc\nfragmentation at early times (< 10 Myr) were discussed in Li et al. (2015). In\nthis paper we extend the analysis by following the long-term evolution of\ndisc-fragmented systems, up to an age of 10 Gyr, covering the ages of the\nstellar and substellar population in the Galactic field. We find that the\nsystems continue to decay, although the rates at which companions escape or\ncollide with each other are substantially lower than during the first 10 Myr,\nand that dynamical evolution is limited beyond 1 Gyr. By t = 10 Gyr, about one\nthird of the host stars is single, and more than half have only one companion\nleft. Most of the other systems have two companions left that orbit their host\nstar in widely separated orbits.

We find\nthat: (i) continuous radiative feedback stabilizes the disc and suppresses\nfurther fragmentation, reducing the number secondary objects formed; (ii)\nepisodic feedback from secondary objects heats and stabilises the disc when the\noutburst occurs, but shortly after the outburst stops, the disc becomes\nunstable and fragments again. However, fewer secondary objects are formed\ncompared to the the case without radiative feedback. We also find that the mass\ngrowth of secondary objects is mildly suppressed due to the effect of their\nradiative feedback. However, their mass growth also depends on where they form\nin the disc and on their subsequent interactions, such that their final masses\nare not drastically different from the case without radiative feedback. We find\nthat the masses of secondary objects formed by disc fragmentation are from a\nfew M$_{\\rm J}$ to a few 0.1 M$_{\\odot}$. Planets formed by fragmentation tend\nto be ejected from the disc. We conclude that planetary-mass objects on wide\norbits (wide-orbit planets) are unlikely to form by disc fragmentation.\nNevertheless, disc fragmentation may be a significant source of free-floating\nplanets and brown dwarfs. \n\n"}

In order to constrain planet\nformation models using disk observations, it is crucial to find a robust way to\nquantitatively back out the properties of the gap-opening planets, in\nparticular their masses, from the observed gap properties, such as their depths\nand widths. Combing 2D and 3D hydrodynamics simulations with 3D radiative\ntransfer simulations, we investigate the morphology of planet-opened gaps in\nnear-infrared scattered light images. Quantitatively, we obtain correlations\nthat directly link intrinsic gap depths and widths in the gas surface density\nto observed depths and widths in images of disks at modest inclinations under\nfinite angular resolution. Subsequently, the properties of the surface density\ngaps enable us to derive the disk scale height at the location of the gap $h$,\nand to constrain the quantity $M_{\\rm p}^2/\\alpha$, where $M_{\\rm p}$ is the\nmass of the gap-opening planet and $\\alpha$ characterizes the viscosity in the\ngap.

The\npresence of a third star in an orbit around a binary system can significantly\nalter the evolution of those stars and the binary system. The rich dynamical\nbehavior in three-body systems can give rise to Lidov-Kozai cycles, in which\nthe eccentricity of the inner orbit and the inclination between the inner and\nouter orbit vary periodically. In turn, this can lead to an enhancement of\ntidal effects (tidal friction), gravitational-wave emission and stellar\ninteractions such as mass transfer and collisions. The lack of a\nself-consistent treatment of triple evolution, including both three-body\ndynamics as well as stellar evolution, hinders the systematic study and general\nunderstanding of the long-term evolution of triple systems.

The\ncurrent explanation for the source of this variation is that inflows into\nactive regions alter the global surface pattern of the meridional circulation.\nWhen these localized inflows are integrated over a full hemisphere, they\ncontribute to the slow down of the axisymmetric poleward horizontal component.\nThe behavior of this large scale flow deep inside the convection zone remains\nlargely unknown. Present helioseismic techniques are not sensitive enough to\ncapture the dynamics of this weak large scale flow. Moreover, the large time of\nintegration needed to map the meridional circulation inside the convection\nzone, also masks some of the possible dynamics on shorter timescales. In this\nwork we examine the dynamics of the meridional circulation that emerges from a\n3D MHD global simulation of the solar convection zone. Our aim is to assess and\nquantify the behavior of meridional circulation deep inside the convection\nzone, where the cyclic large-scale magnetic field can reach considerable\nstrength. Our analyses indicate that the meridional circulation morphology and\namplitude are both highly influenced by the magnetic field, via the impact of\nmagnetic torques on the global angular momentum distribution.

Inspired by this result, we study the effect of ISM absorption\non activity measurements (S and logR'$_{\\rm HK}$ indices) for main-sequence\nlate-type stars. To this end, we employ synthetic stellar photospheric spectra\ncombined with varying amounts of chromospheric emission and ISM absorption. We\npresent the effect of ISM absorption on activity measurements by varying\nseveral instrumental, stellar, and ISM parameters. We find that for relative\nvelocities between the stellar and ISM lines smaller than 30-40 km/s and for\nISM CaII column densities logN$_{\\rm CaII}$>12, the ISM absorption has a\nsignificant influence on activity measurements. Direct measurements and three\ndimensional maps of the Galactic ISM absorption indicate that an ISM CaII\ncolumn density of logN$_{\\rm CaII}$=12 is typically reached by a distance of\nabout 100 pc along most sight lines.

The ram pressure exerted\nby the flow can truncate the disc and the accretion of material with no\nazimuthal angular momentum leads to further disc contraction. We derive a\ntheoretical model from accretion disc theory that describes the evolution of\nthe disc radius, mass, and surface density profile as a function of the density\nand velocity of the ambient medium. We test our model by performing\nhydrodynamical simulations of a protoplanetary disc embedded in a flow with\ndifferent velocities and densities. We find that our model gives an adequate\ndescription of the evolution of the disc radius and accretion rate onto the\ndisc. The total disc mass in the simulations follows the theoretically expected\ntrend, except at the lowest density where our simulated discs lose mass owing\nto continuous stripping. This stripping may be a numerical rather than a\nphysical effect. Some quantitative differences exist between the model\npredictions and the simulations. These are at least partly caused by numerical\nviscous effects in the disc and depend on the resolution of the simulation.

The particle flux of the\ncontemporary Sun cannot explain these anomalies. However, similar to T Tauri\nstars the young Sun was more active and probably produced enough high energy\nparticles to explain those anomalies. We want to study the interaction of\nstellar energetic particles with the gas component of the disk and identify\npossible observational tracers of this interaction. We use a 2D radiation\nthermo-chemical protoplanetary disk code to model a disk representative for T\nTauri stars. We use a particle energy distribution derived from solar flare\nobservations and an enhanced stellar particle flux proposed for T Tauri stars.\nFor this particle spectrum we calculate the stellar particle ionization rate\nthroughout the disk with an accurate particle transport model.

This new method aims to be free from any priors with respect to the\ncolumn density and intrinsic color distribution. It is applicable to any\ncombination of parameters and works in arbitrary numbers of dimensions.\nFurthermore, it is not restricted to color space. Extinction towards single\nsources is determined by fitting Gaussian Mixture Models along the extinction\nvector to (extinction-free) control field observations. In this way it becomes\npossible to describe the extinction for observed sources with probability\ndensities. PNICER effectively eliminates known biases found in similar methods\nand outperforms them in cases of deep observational data where the number of\nbackground galaxies is significant, or when a large number of parameters is\nused to break degeneracies in the intrinsic color distributions. This new\nmethod remains computationally competitive, making it possible to correctly\nde-redden millions of sources within a matter of seconds. With the\never-increasing number of large-scale high-sensitivity imaging surveys, PNICER\noffers a fast and reliable way to efficiently calculate extinction for\narbitrary parameter combinations without prior information on source\ncharacteristics.

Tidal interactions may have played an important role in\nthe evolution of the spin-orbit angle. In this study, we investigate the tidal\ninteractions in spin-orbit misaligned systems. In particular, we focus on the\ntidal response of a rotating fluid body to the obliquity tide, which may be\nimportant for the evolution of the spin-orbit angle but hardly affects the\norbital evolution. The obliquity tide also provides a torque for the mutual\nprecession of the spin and orbital axes around the total angular momentum\nvector, which has not yet been considered in previous studies on the tidal\ninteractions. In this paper, we first formulate a set of linearized equations\ndescribing the tidal response in spin-orbit misaligned systems, taking into\naccount the precessional motion. Numerical solutions in a homogeneous fluid and\nin a polytrope of index 1 show that dissipative inertial waves can be excited\non top of precession by the obliquity tide in the presence of a rigid core. The\ntidal quality factor associated with the obliquity tide $Q'_{210}$ can be\nseveral orders of magnitude smaller than those associated with other tidal\ncomponents if their frequencies fall outside the frequency range of inertial\nwaves.

By extending and\ngeneralising the study of Jones et al (2012), we demonstrate that this\nparameter should be less than or of order unity for a wide range of\nevolutionary scenarios, rising above unity only during the final stages of\noutside in clearing by external photoevaporation. We use this result to assess\nthe reliability of disc mass estimates derived from CO isotopologues and submm\ncontinuum emission by examining the distribution of accretion efficiencies in\nregions which are not subject to external photoevaporation. We find that while\ndust based mass estimates produce results compatible with theoretical\nexpectations assuming canonical dust/gas ratio, the systematically lower CO\nbased estimates yield accretion efficiencies significantly above unity in\ncontrast with the theory.

With this, we constrain the local conditions around V830 Tau\nb that we use to then compute its radio emission. We estimate average radio\nflux densities of 6 to 24mJy, depending on the assumed radius of the planet\n(one or two Rjupiter).

We show here that these fluxes are weakly dependent\n(a factor of 1.8) on the assumed polar planetary magnetic field (10 to 100G),\nopposed to the maximum frequency of the emission, which ranges from 18 to\n240MHz. We also estimate the thermal radio emission from the stellar wind. By\ncomparing our results with VLA and VLBA observations of the system, we\nconstrain the stellar mass-loss rate to be <3e-9 Msun/yr, with likely values\nbetween ~1e-12 and 1e-10 Msun/yr. The frequency-dependent extension of the\nradio-emitting wind is around ~ 3 to 30 Rstar for frequencies in the range of\n275 to 50MHz, implying that V830 Tau b, at an orbital distance of 6.1 Rstar,\ncould be embedded in the regions of the host star's wind that are optically\nthick to radio wavelengths, but not deeply so.

Analysis of Moon rocks shows a close Earth-Moon\ncomposition similarity, posing a challenge for the giant-impact scenario, given\nthat impactors were thought to significantly differ in composition from the\nplanets they impact. Here we use a large set of 140 simulations to show that\nthe composition of impactors could be very similar to that of the planets they\nimpact; in $4.9\\%$-$18.2\\%$ ($1.9\\%$-$6.7\\%$) of the cases the resulting\ncomposition of the Moon is consistent with the observations of\n$\\Delta^{17}O<15$ ($\\Delta^{17}O<6$ ppm). These findings suggest that the\nEarth-Moon composition similarity could be resolved as to arise from the\nprimordial Earth-impactor composition similarity. Note that although we find\nthe likelihood for the suggested competing model of very high mass-ratio\nimpacts (producing significant Earth-impactor composition mixing) is comparable\n($<6.7\\%$), this scenario also requires additional fine-tuned requirements of a\nvery fast spinning Earth. Using the same simulations we also explore the\ncomposition of giant-impact formed Mars-moons as well as Vesta-like asteroids.\nWe find that the Mars-moon composition difference should be large, but smaller\nthan expected if the moons are captured asteroids. Finally, we find that the\nleft-over planetesimals ('asteroids') in our simulations are frequently\nscattered far away from their initial positions, thus potentially explaining\nthe mismatch between the current position and composition of the Vesta\nasteroid. \n\n"}

We\nobserve a more gentle increase of the water vapor mixing ratio in response to\nincreased incident flux than one-dimensional models suggest, in qualitative\nagreement with the climate-stabilizing effect of clouds around the substellar\npoint previously observed in GCMs applied to synchronously rotating planets.\nHowever, the water vapor mixing ratio in the upper atmosphere starts to\nincrease while the surface temperature is still moderate. This is explained by\nthe circulation in the upper atmosphere being driven by the radiative heating\ndue to absorption by water vapor and cloud particles, causing efficient\nvertical transport of water vapor.

We perform simulations\nof embedded star clusters with parameterisations for both processes to\ndetermine the environment in which either of these processes is dominant.

We present a mechanism\nthat causes such a spin-orbit misalignment for a protoplanetary disc due to its\nmovement through an ambient medium. Our physical explanation of the mechanism\nis based on the theoretical solutions to the Stark problem. We test this idea\nby performing self-consistent hydrodynamical simulations and simplified\ngravitational $N$-body simulations. The $N$-body model reduces the mechanism to\nthe relevant physical processes. The hydrodynamical simulations show the\nmechanism in its full extent, including gas-dynamical and viscous processes in\nthe disc which are not included in the theoretical framework. We find that a\nprotoplanetary disc embedded in a flow changes its orientation as its angular\nmomentum vector tends to align parallel to the relative velocity vector. Due to\nthe force exerted by the flow, orbits in the disc become eccentric, which\nproduces a net torque and consequentially changes the orbital inclination. The\ntilting of the disc causes it to contract. Apart from becoming lopsided, the\ngaseous disc also forms a spiral arm even if the inclination does not change\nsubstantially. The process is most effective at high velocities and\nobservational signatures are therefore mostly expected in massive star-forming\nregions and around winds or supernova ejecta.

We fit the observations\ndirectly in the uv-plane using a two-layer disk model that computes the 890\nmicron emission by solving the energy balance at each disk radius. For 22 out\nof 36 protoplanetary disks we derive robust estimates of their physical\nproperties. The sample covers stellar masses between ~0.1 and ~2 Solar masses,\nand we find no trend between the average disk temperatures and the stellar\nparameters.

This has applications in both stellar astrophysics\nand the growing number of exoplanet surveys around M-dwarfs.

We find that only 1 - 6 per\ncent of FFLOPs are ensnared by stars, even with the most optimal initial\nconditions for capture in star-forming regions (one FFLOP per star, and highly\ncorrelated stellar velocities to facilitate capture). Depending on the initial\nconditions of the star-forming regions, only 5 - 10 of 10000 planets are\ncaptured onto orbits that lie within the constraints for Planet 9. When we\napply an additional environmental constraint for Solar system formation -\nnamely the injection of short-lived radioisotopes into the Sun's protoplanetary\ndisc from supernovae - we find that the probability for the capture of Planet 9\nto be almost zero. \n\n"}

We investigate whether such structures are due to the\nmorphology of the disk itself or if they are instead an intrinsic feature of CN\nemission. With the intention of using CN as a diagnostic, we also address to\nwhich physical and chemical parameters CN is most sensitive. A set of disk\nmodels were run for different stellar spectra, masses, and physical structures\nvia the 2D thermochemical code DALI. An updated chemical network that accounts\nfor the most relevant CN reactions was adopted. Ring-shaped emission is found\nto be a common feature of all adopted models; the highest abundance is found in\nthe upper outer regions of the disk, and the column density peaks at 30-100 AU\nfor T Tauri stars with standard accretion rates. Higher mass disks generally\nshow brighter CN. Higher UV fields, such as those appropriate for T Tauri stars\nwith high accretion rates or for Herbig Ae stars or for higher disk flaring,\ngenerally result in brighter and larger rings. These trends are due to the main\nformation paths of CN, which all start with vibrationally excited H2*\nmolecules, that are produced through far ultraviolet (FUV) pumping of H2. The\nmodel results compare well with observed disk-integrated CN fluxes and the\nobserved location of the CN ring for the TW Hya disk. CN rings are produced\nnaturally in protoplanetary disks and do not require a specific underlying disk\nstructure such as a dust cavity or gap. The strong link between FUV flux and CN\nemission can provide critical information regarding the vertical structure of\nthe disk and the distribution of dust grains which affects the UV penetration,\nand could help to break some degeneracies in the SED fitting. In contrast with\nC2H or c-C3H2, the CN flux is not very sensitive to carbon and oxygen\ndepletion. \n\n"}

Gas accreting from the disc on to the\nstar provides a way to measure the elemental abundances because even refractory\nspecies are in an atomic gaseous form. Here we compare the abundance ratios\nderived from UV lines probing T Tauri accretion streams to simple models of\ndisc evolution. Although the interpretation of line ratios in terms of\nabundances is highly uncertain, discs with large cavities in mm images tend to\nhave lower Si emission. Since this can naturally be explained by the suppressed\naccretion of dust, this suggests that abundance variations are at least\npartially responsible for the variations seen in the line ratios. Our models of\ndisc evolution due to grain growth, radial drift and the flux of volatile\nspecies carried as ices on grain surfaces, give rise to a partial sorting of\nthe atomic species based on the volatility of their dominant molecular\ncarriers. This arises because volatiles are left behind at their snow lines\nwhile the grains continue to drift. We show that this reproduces the main\nfeatures seen in the accretion line ratio data, such as C/N ratios that are a\nfew times solar and the correlation between the Si to volatile ratio with\nmm-flux. We highlight the fact that developing a more robust linkage between\nline ratios and abundance ratios and acquiring data for larger samples has the\npotential to cast considerable light on the chemical history of protoplanetary\ndiscs. \n\n"}

We combined spectroscopic data from the Gaia-ESO Survey (GES)\nwith multi-wavelength photometry from the Coordinated Synoptic Investigation of\nNGC 2264 (CSI 2264). We examined a sample of 655 cluster members, including\nboth disk-bearing and disk-free young stars. We find a significant age spread\nof 4-5 Myr among cluster members. Disk-bearing objects are statistically\nassociated with younger isochronal ages than disk-free sources. The cluster has\na hierarchical structure, with two main blocks. The northern half develops\naround the O-type binary star S Mon; the southern half, close to the tip of the\nCone Nebula, contains the most embedded regions of NGC 2264, populated mainly\nby objects with disks and ongoing accretion. The median ages of objects at\ndifferent locations within the cluster, and the spatial distribution of disked\nand non-disked sources, suggest that star formation began in the north of the\ncluster, over 5 Myr ago, and was ignited in its southern region a few Myr\nlater. Star formation is likely still ongoing in the most embedded regions of\nthe cluster, while the outer regions host a widespread population of more\nevolved objects. We find a detectable lag between the typical age of\ndisk-bearing objects and that of accreting objects in the inner regions of NGC\n2264: the first tend to be older than the second, but younger than disk-free\nsources at similar locations within the cluster. This supports earlier findings\nthat the characteristic timescales of disk accretion are shorter than those of\ndisk dispersal, and smaller than the average age of NGC 2264 (i.e., < 3 Myr).\nAt the same time, disks in the north of the cluster tend to be shorter-lived\n(~2.5 Myr) than elsewhere; this may reflect the impact of massive stars within\nthe region (notably S Mon), that trigger rapid disk dispersal. \n\n"}

The radiative, three dimensional hydrodynamic simulations were then\npost-processed with RADMC3D and the ALMA Observation Simulator.

Similar fluxes were found in the\ncase of Saturn and Jupiter-mass planets, as for the 10 $\\mathrm{M_{Jup}}$\ngas-giant, due to temperature weighted optical depth effects: when no deep gap\nis carved, the planet region is blanketed by the optically thick circumstellar\ndisk leading to a less efficient cooling there.

Trojans are one of these components and can be considered\nfossils of the first stages in the life of planetary systems. Their detection\nin extrasolar systems would open a new scientific window to investigate\nformation and migration processes.

In this first paper, we describe the goals and\nmethodology of the project. Additionally, we used archival radial velocity data\nof 46 planetary systems to place upper limits on the mass of possible trojans\nand investigate the presence of co-orbital planets down to several tens of\nEarth masses. We used archival radial velocity data of 46 close-in (P<5 days)\ntransiting planets (without detected companions) with information from\nhigh-precision radial velocity instruments.

We measure the deposition of angular\nmomentum in the disk by spiral shocks of different strength and verify the\nanalytical prediction of Rafikov (2016) for the behavior of this quantity,\nusing shock amplitude (which is potentially observable) as the input variable.\nGood agreement between the theory and numerics is found as we vary shock\namplitude (including highly nonlinear shocks), disk aspect ratio, equation of\nstate, radial profiles of the background density and temperature, and pattern\nspeed of the wave. We show that high numerical resolution is required to\nproperly capture shock-driven transport, especially at low wave amplitudes.

We find that fragment-fragment scattering dominates the orbital\nevolution, even when we enforce rapid migration and inefficient gap formation.\n  Compared to our previous model, we see a small increase in the number of\nterrestrial-type objects being formed, although their survival under tidal\nevolution is at best unclear. We also see evidence for disrupted fragments with\nevolved grain populations - this is circumstantial evidence for the formation\nof planetesimal belts, a phenomenon not seen in runs where fragment-fragment\ninteractions are ignored.\n  In spite of intense dynamical evolution, our population is dominated by\nmassive giant planets and brown dwarfs at large semimajor axis, which direct\nimaging surveys should, but only rarely, detect. Finally, disc fragmentation is\nshown to be an efficient manufacturer of free floating planetary mass objects,\nand the typical multiplicity of systems formed via gravitational instability\nwill be low. \n\n"}

Formation\n  mechanism Abstract: Protoplanetary disk simulations show that a single planet can excite more\nthan one spiral arm, possibly explaining recent observations of multiple spiral\narms in some systems. In this paper, we explain the mechanism by which a planet\nexcites multiple spiral arms in a protoplanetary disk. Contrary to previous\nspeculations, the formation of both primary and additional arms can be\nunderstood as a linear process when the planet mass is sufficiently small. A\nplanet resonantly interacts with epicyclic oscillations in the disk, launching\nspiral wave modes around the Lindblad resonances. When a set of wave modes is\nin phase, they can constructively interfere with each other and create a spiral\narm. More than one spiral arm can form because such constructive interference\ncan occur for different sets of wave modes, with the exact number and launching\nposition of spiral arms dependent on the planet mass as well as the disk\ntemperature profile. Non-linear effects become increasingly important as the\nplanet mass increases, resulting in spiral arms with stronger shocks and thus\nlarger pitch angles. This is found in common for both primary and additional\narms. When a planet has a sufficiently large mass ($\\gtrsim$ 3 thermal masses\nfor $(h/r)_p=0.1$), only two spiral arms form interior to its orbit. The wave\nmodes that would form a tertiary arm for smaller mass planets merge with the\nprimary arm. Improvements in our understanding of the formation of spiral arms\ncan provide crucial insights into the origin of observed spiral arms in\nprotoplanetary disks. \n\n"}

Implications Abstract: We examine whether various characteristics of planet-driven spiral arms can\nbe used to constrain the masses of unseen planets and their positions within\ntheir disks. By carrying out two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations varying\nplanet mass and disk gas temperature, we find that a larger number of spiral\narms form with a smaller planet mass and a lower disk temperature. A planet\nexcites two or more spiral arms interior to its orbit for a range of disk\ntemperature characterized by the disk aspect ratio $0.04\\leq(h/r)_p\\leq0.15$,\nwhereas exterior to a planet's orbit multiple spiral arms can form only in cold\ndisks with $(h/r)_p \\lesssim 0.06$. Constraining the planet mass with the pitch\nangle of spiral arms requires accurate disk temperature measurements that might\nbe challenging even with ALMA. However, the property that the pitch angle of\nplanet-driven spiral arms decreases away from the planet can be a powerful\ndiagnostic to determine whether the planet is located interior or exterior to\nthe observed spirals. The arm-to-arm separations increase as a function of\nplanet mass, consistent with previous studies; however, the exact slope depends\non disk temperature as well as the radial location where the arm-to-arm\nseparations are measured. We apply these diagnostics to the spiral arms seen in\nMWC 758 and Elias 2-27. As shown in Bae et al.

{"id": "1801.01474", "contents": "Title: Galactic Effects on Habitability Abstract: The galactic environment has been suspected to influence planetary\nhabitability in many ways. Very metal-poor regions of the Galaxy, or those\nlargely devoid of atoms more massive than H and He, are thought to be unable to\nform habitable planets. Moreover, if such planets do form, the young system is\nsubjected to close stellar passages while it resides in its stellar birth\ncluster. Various potential hazards remain after clusters disperse. For\ninstance, central galactic regions may present risks to habitability via nearby\nsupernovae, gamma ray bursts (GRBs), and frequent comet showers. In addition,\nplanets residing within very wide binary star systems are affected by the\nGalaxy, as local gravitational perturbations from the Galaxy can increase the\nbinary's eccentricity until it destabilizes the planets it hosts. Here we\nreview the most recent work on the main galactic influences over planetary\nhabitability. Although there must be some metallicity limit below which rocky\nplanets cannot form, recent exoplanet surveys show that they form around stars\nwith a very large range of metallicities. Once formed, the probability of star\nclusters destabilizing planetary systems only becomes high for rare, extremely\nlong-lived clusters. Regarding threats to habitability from supernovae, GRBs,\nand comet showers, many recent studies suggest that their hazards are more\nlimited than originally thought. Finally, denser regions of the Galaxy enhance\nthe threat that very wide binary companions pose to planetary habitability, but\nthe probability that a very wide binary star disrupts habitability will always\nbe substantially below 100% for any environment. While some Milky Way regions\nmust be more hospitable to habitable planets than others, it is difficult to\nstate that habitable planets are confined to any well-defined region of the\nGalaxy or that any other particular region of the Galaxy is uninhabitable. \n\n"}

Many of them relate to its\nlack of cometary activity, suggesting refractory composition of 'Oumuamua. Here\nwe explore the possibility that 'Oumuamua-like ISAs are produced in tidal\ndisruption events (TDEs) of refractory planetoids (asteroids, dwarf planets,\netc.) by the white dwarfs (WDs). This idea is supported by existing\nspectroscopic observations of metal-polluted WDs, hinting at predominantly\nvolatile-poor composition of accreted material. We show that such TDEs sourced\nby realistic planetary systems (including a population of >1000 km planetoids\nand massive perturbers - Neptune-to-Saturn mass planets) can eject to\ninterstellar space up to 30% of planetary mass involved in them. Collisional\nfragmentation, caused by convergent vertical motion of the disrupted\nplanetoid's debris inside the Roche sphere of the WD, channels most of the\noriginal mass into 0.1-1 km fragments, similar to 'Oumuamua. Such size spectrum\nof ISAs (very different from the top-heavy distributions expected in other\nscenarios) implies that planetary TDEs can account for a significant fraction\n(up to ~30% under optimistic assumptions) of the ISAs. This figure is based on\nexisting observations of WD metal pollution and accounts for observational\nbiases by using realistic models of circum-WD planetary systems. ISAs should\nexhibit kinematic characteristics similar to old, dynamically hot Galactic\npopulations; we interpret 'Oumuamua's slow Galactic motion as a statistical\nfluctuation. ISA ejection in individual planetary TDEs is highly anisotropic,\nresulting in large fluctuations of their space density. We also show that other\nISA production mechanisms involving stellar remnants - direct ejection by\nmassive planets around WDs and SN explosions - have difficulty explaining\n'Oumuamua-like ISAs. \n\n"}

We want to determine why the SED of HD 163296 is\nintermediary between the otherwise well-separated group I and group II Herbig\nstars. Methods. The disk was modelled using the Monte Carlo radiative transfer\ncode MCMax3D. The radial dust surface density profile was modelled after the\nALMA observations, while the polarized scattered light observations were used\nto constrain the inclination of the inner disk component and turbulence and\ngrain growth in the outer disk. Results. While three rings are observed in the\ndisk midplane in millimeter thermal emission at $\\sim$80, 124 and 200 AU, only\nthe innermost of these is observed in polarized scattered light, indicating a\nlack of small dust grains on the surface of the outer disk.

In this paper, we\nstudy the effect of potential cometary impacts on the TRAPPIST-1 planets and\nhow they would affect the primordial atmospheres of these planets. We consider\nboth atmospheric mass loss and volatile delivery with a view to assessing\nwhether any sort of life has a chance to develop. We ran N-body simulations to\ninvestigate the orbital evolution of potential impacting comets, to determine\nwhich planets are more likely to be impacted and the distributions of impact\nvelocities. We consider three scenarios that could potentially throw comets\ninto the inner region (i.e within 0.1au where the seven planets are located)\nfrom an (as yet undetected) outer belt similar to the Kuiper belt or an Oort\ncloud: Planet scattering, the Kozai-Lidov mechanism and Galactic tides. For the\ndifferent scenarios, we quantify, for each planet, how much atmospheric mass is\nlost and what mass of volatiles can be delivered over the age of the system\ndepending on the mass scattered out of the outer belt. We find that the\nresulting high velocity impacts can easily destroy the primordial atmospheres\nof all seven planets, even if the mass scattered from the outer belt is as low\nas that of the Kuiper belt. However, we find that the atmospheres of the\noutermost planets f, g and h can also easily be replenished with cometary\nvolatiles (e.g. $\\sim$ an Earth ocean mass of water could be delivered). These\nscenarios would thus imply that the atmospheres of these outermost planets\ncould be more massive than those of the innermost planets, and have\nvolatiles-enriched composition. \n\n"}

These\ninstabilities can alter the orbits of gas giants as well as the orbits of\nterrestrial planets and therefore eject or move a habitable planet out of the\nhabitable zone. In this work 423 simulations with 153 different hypothetical\nplanetary systems with gas giants and terrestrial planets have been modelled to\nexplore the orbital stability of habitable planets. The initial parameter\nvariations include the number, distances and masses of the giant planets and\nthe star type. Linear correlations between the initial number and the initial\ndistances of gas giants and the survival rate of habitable planets were found.\nPlanetary systems consisting of two giant planets are fairly benign to\nterrestrial planets, whereas six giant planets very often lead to a complete\nclearing of the habitable zone. Systems with initial distances of five Hill\nRadii between the giant planets have a high chance to harbour a habitable\nplanet, although more compact systems are very destructive. The giant planet\nmasses have a smaller impact on the stability of habitable worlds.\nAdditionally, a link between the present-day orbit of an observed giant\nexoplanet and the survival rate of habitable planets was established. As a rule\nof thumb, observed gas giants with eccentricities higher than 0.4 and\ninclinations higher than 20 degrees have experienced strong planet-planet\nscatterings and are unlikely to have a habitable planet in its system.\nFurthermore, it was found that habitable planets surrounding a K or M-star have\na higher survival rate than those surrounding a G-star. \n\n"}

Most likely due to instrumental limitations and their natural\nfaintness, little is known about debris disks around low-mass stars, especially\nwhen it comes to spatially resolved observations. We present new VLT/SPHERE\nIRDIS Dual-Polarization Imaging (DPI) observations in which we detect the dust\nring around the M2 spectral type star TWA\\,7. Combined with additional Angular\nDifferential Imaging observations we aim at a fine characterization of the\ndebris disk and setting constraints on the presence of low-mass planets. We\nmodel the SPHERE DPI observations and constrain the location of the small dust\ngrains, as well as the spectral energy distribution of the debris disk, using\nthe results inferred from the observations, and perform simple N-body\nsimulations. We find that the dust density distribution peaks at 25 au, with a\nvery shallow outer power-law slope, and that the disk has an inclination of 13\ndegrees with a position angle of 90 degrees East of North. We also report low\nsignal-to-noise detections of an outer belt at a distance of ~52 au from the\nstar, of a spiral arm in the Southern side of the star, and of a possible dusty\nclump at 3.9 au. These findings seem to persist over timescales of at least a\nyear. Using the intensity images, we do not detect any planets in the close\nvicinity of the star, but the sensitivity reaches Jovian planet mass upper\nlimits. We find that the SED is best reproduced with an inner disk at 7 au and\nanother belt at 25 au. We report the detections of several unexpected features\nin the disk around TWA\\,7. A yet undetected 100 M$_\\oplus$ planet with a\nsemi-major axis at 20-30 au could possibly explain the outer belt as well as\nthe spiral arm. We conclude that stellar winds are unlikely to be responsible\nfor the spiral arm. \n\n"}

To improve the situation, we have developed a framework, called FDPS,\nwhich enables researchers to easily develop massively parallel particle\nsimulation codes for arbitrary particle methods. Until version 3.0, FDPS have\nprovided API only for C++ programing language. This limitation comes from the\nfact that FDPS is developed using the template feature in C++, which is\nessential to support arbitrary data types of particle. However, there are many\nresearchers who use Fortran to develop their codes. Thus, the previous versions\nof FDPS require such people to invest much time to learn C++. This is\ninefficient. To cope with this problem, we newly developed a Fortran interface\nlayer in FDPS, which provides API for Fortran. In order to support arbitrary\ndata types of particle in Fortran, we design the Fortran interface layer as\nfollows. Based on a given derived data type in Fortran representing particle, a\nPython script provided by us automatically generates a library that manipulates\nthe C++ core part of FDPS. This library is seen as a Fortran module providing\nAPI of FDPS from the Fortran side and uses C programs internally to\ninteroperate Fortran with C++. In this way, we have overcome several technical\nissues when emulating `template' in Fortran. By using the Fortran interface,\nusers can develop all parts of their codes in Fortran.

These\nplanets orbit stars with a range of metallicities and occur more frequently\naround lower mass stars, indicating that planet formation takes place in a wide\nrange of environments.

Ground-based ELTs will also contribute to surveying the\natmospheres of the transiting planets discovered by TESS. Here we present a set\nof two straightforward analytic metrics, quantifying the expected\nsignal-to-noise in transmission and thermal emission spectroscopy for a given\nplanet, that will allow the top atmospheric characterization targets to be\nreadily identified among the TESS planet candidates. Targets that meet our\nproposed threshold values for these metrics would be encouraged for rapid\nfollow-up and confirmation via radial velocity mass measurements. Based on the\ncatalog of simulated TESS detections by Sullivan et al.

Here we explore the origin of spiral arms in Herbig systems by\nstudying their occurrence rates, disk properties, and stellar accretion rates.\nWe find that two-arm spirals are more common in disks surrounding Herbig\nintermediate mass stars than are directly imaged giant planet companions to\nmature A and B stars. If two-arm spirals are produced by such giant planets,\nthis discrepancy suggests that giant planets are much fainter than predicted by\nhot start models. In addition, the high stellar accretion rates of Herbig\nstars, if sustained over a reasonable fraction of their lifetimes, suggest that\ndisk masses are much larger than inferred from their submillimeter continuum\nemission.As a result, gravitational instability is a possible explanation for\nmulti-arm spirals.

Several sulfur-bearing molecules are observed in the interstellar\nmedium and in comets, in strong contrast to protoplanetary disks where only CS,\nH$_2$CS and SO have been detected so far. Aims. We combine observations and\nchemical models to constrain the sulfur abundances and their sensitivity to\nphysical and chemical conditions in the DM Tau protoplanetary disk. Methods. We\nobtained $0.5^{\"}$ ALMA observations of DM Tau in Bands 4 and 6 in lines of CS,\nSO, SO$_2$, OCS, CCS, H$_2$CS and H$_2$S, achieving a $\\sim 5$ mJy sensitivity.\nUsing the non-LTE radiative transfer code RADEX and the forward-modeling tool\nDiskFit, disk-averaged CS column densities and upper limits for the other\nspecies were derived. Results. Only CS was detected with a derived column\ndensity of $\\sim 2-6 \\times 10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$. We report a first tentative\ndetection of SO$_2$ in DM Tau. The upper limits range between $\\sim 10^{11}$\nand $10^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$ for the other S-bearing species. The best-fit chemical\nmodel matching these values requires a gas-phase C/O ratio of > 1 at $r \\sim\n50-100$ au. With chemical modeling we demonstrate that sulfur-bearing species\ncould be robust tracers of the gas-phase C/O ratio, surface reaction rates,\ngrain size and UV intensities. Conclusions. The lack of detections of a variety\nof sulfur-bearing molecules in DM Tau other than CS implies a dearth of\nreactive sulfur in the gas phase, either through efficient freeze-out or\nbecause most of the elemental sulfur is in other large species, as found in\ncomets. The inferred high CS/SO and CS/SO$_2$ ratios require a non-solar C/O\ngas-phase ratio of > 1, consistent with the recent observations of hydrocarbon\nrings in DM Tau. The stronger depletion of oxygen-bearing S-species compared to\nCS is likely linked to the low observed abundances of gaseous water in DM Tau\nand points to a removal mechanism of oxygen from the gas. \n\n"}

However, if a star has dark starspots (or bright regions) distributed\nthroughout the transit chord, the transit depth will be biased towards smaller\n(larger) values, and thus the inferred planet radius will be smaller (larger)\nif unaccounted for. We reparameterize the transit light curve to account for\n\"self-contamination\" by photospheric inhomogeneities by splitting the parameter\n$R_p/R_\\star$ into two parameters: one for the radius ratio -- which controls\nthe duration of ingress and egress -- and another which measures the possibly\ncontaminated transit depth.

We use\nsynthetic light curves of spotted stars at high signal-to-noise to show that\nthe radius recovered from measurement of the ingress/egress duration can\nrecover the true radii of planets transiting spotted stars with axisymmetric\nspot distributions if the limb-darkening parameters are precisely known.

One and only mechanism proposed for prolonging the residence time of\nhot grains in the near-stellar environments is trapping of charged\nnanoparticles by stellar magnetic fields. We revisit the model of magnetic\ngrain trapping around main-sequence stars of various spectral classes by taking\ninto account sublimation and electric charging of the grains. The model of\nmagnetic grain trapping predicts that hot dust grains are present in the\nvicinity of main-sequence stars with high rotation velocities and intermediate\nmagnetic-field strengths. On the contrary, we find that the detection of hot\ndust grains has no correlation with the rotation velocities of central stars\nnor the magnetic field strengths of the stars. Our numerical evaluation of\nelectric grain charging indicates that the surface potential of\nsubmicrometer-sized grains in the vicinity of main-sequence stars is typically\n4-5 V, which is one order of magnitude smaller than the value assumed by the\nmodel of magnetic grain trapping.

Despite many efforts in trying to mitigate the effect of\nstellar activity using empirical and statistical techniques, it seems that we\nare facing an obstacle that will be extremely difficult to overcome using\ncurrent techniques. In this paper, we investigate a novel approach to derive\nprecise RVs considering the wealth of information present in high-resolution\nspectra. This new method consists in building a master spectrum from all\nobservations and measure the RVs of each spectral line in a spectrum relative\nto it. When analysing several spectra, the final product is the RVs of each\nline as a function of time. We demonstrate on three stars intensively observed\nwith HARPS that our new method gives RVs that are extremely similar to the ones\nderived from the HARPS data reduction software. Our new approach to derive RVs\ndemonstrates that the non-stability of daily HARPS wavelength solution induces\nnight-to-night RV offsets with an standard deviation of 0.4 m/s, and we propose\na solution to correct for this systematic. Finally, and this is probably the\nmost astrophysically relevant result of this paper, we demonstrate that some\nspectral lines are strongly affected by stellar activity while others are not.\nBy measuring the RVs on two carefully selected subsample of spectral lines, we\ndemonstrate that we can boost by a factor of 2 or mitigate by a factor of 1.6\nthe red noise induced by stellar activity in the 2010 RVs of Alpha Cen B. By\nmeasuring the RVs of each spectral line, we are able to reach the same RV\nprecision as other approved techniques. In addition, this new approach allows\nto demonstrate that each line is differently affected by stellar activity.\nPreliminary results show that studying in details the behaviour of each\nspectral line is probably the key to overcome stellar activity. \n\n"}

Despite initial understandings of\natmospheric dynamics which is the major cause of the variability by previous\nstudies, the detailed mechanism of variability remains elusive, and we need to\nseek a natural, self-consistent mechanism.

Here\nwe extend these 2D simulations to three dimensions (3D) and find that rings and\ngaps are still formed in the presence of a moderately strong ambipolar\ndiffusion. The rings and gaps form from the same basic mechanism that was\nidentified in the 2D simulations, namely, the redistribution of the poloidal\nmagnetic flux relative to the disk material as a result of the reconnection of\na sharply pinched poloidal magnetic field lines. Thus, the less dense gaps are\nmore strongly magnetized with a large poloidal magnetic field compared to the\nless magnetized (dense) rings. The rings and gaps start out rather smoothly in\n3D simulations that have axisymmetric initial conditions. Non-axisymmetric\nvariations arise spontaneously at later times, but they do not grow to such an\nextent as to disrupt the rings and gaps. These disk substructures persist to\nthe end of the simulations, lasting up to 3000 orbital periods at the inner\nedge of the simulated disk. The longevity of the perturbed yet still coherent\nrings make them attractive sites for trapping large grains that would otherwise\nbe lost to rapid radial migration due to gas drag. As the ambipolar diffusivity\ndecreases, both the disk and the wind become increasingly turbulent, driven by\nthe magnetorotational instability, with tightly-wound spiral arms becoming more\nprominent in the disk. \n\n"}

We synthesise noiseless observations to determine the\nsensitivities required to detect the spiral flux, and find that the line flux\ndistribution does not necessarily correlate to the abundance density\ndistribution; hence performing radiative transfer calculations is imperative.\nMoreover, the spiral features are seen in absorption, due to the GI-heated\nmidplane and high extinction, which could be indicative of GI activity.

HIP 79124 is a member of the\nScorpius-Centaurus association, consisting of an A0V primary with two low-mass\ncompanions at a projected separation of <1 arcsecond. Thanks to the high\nquality wavefront corrections provided by SCExAO, both companions are\ndecisively detected without the employment of any PSF-subtraction algorithm to\neliminate quasi-static noise.

Abstract: Disk polarization in (sub)millimeter dust continuum is a rapidly growing\nfield in the ALMA era. It opens up the exciting possibility of detecting and\ncharacterizing magnetic fields and grain growth in disks around young stellar\nobjects. However, to use polarization for probing the disk properties, its\nproduction mechanism must be ascertained first. To date, the conventional\nmechanism involving magnetically aligned grains fails to explain the\npolarization patterns detected in most disks. This is especially true for the\ninclined disk of HL Tau in ALMA Band 3 (wavelength $\\sim 3$ mm), which has an\nelliptical polarization pattern. The elliptical pattern was taken as evidence\nfor polarized emission by dust grains aligned with their long axes\nperpendicular the direction of the radiative flux. We show that the radiatively\naligned grains produce a circular, rather than elliptical, polarization pattern\neven in inclined disks such as HL Tau. An elliptical polarization pattern can\nbe produced if the grains are aligned aerodynamically by the difference in\nrotation speed between the dust and gas through the Gold mechanism. However, a\nstrong azimuthal variation in polarized intensity is expected for both the\nradiative and aerodynamic alignment, but not observed in the HL Tau disk in\nALMA Band 3. We conclude that neither of these two mechanisms alone can explain\nthe data and the origin of the 3 mm polarization remains a mystery. We\nspeculate that this mystery may be resolved by a combination of both direct\nemission and scattering by aerodynamically aligned grains. \n\n"}

In this paper, we show that a newly discovered effect by\nHoang et al., so-called RAdiative Torque Disruption (RATD), can act as an\nimportant dynamical constraint for dust models. Using this dynamical\nconstraint, we derive the maximum size of grains that survive in the ISM for\ndifferent dust models, including contact binary, composite, silicate-core, and\namorphous carbon mantle, and compact grain model for the different radiation\nfields. We find that the different dust models have different maximum size due\nto their different tensile strengths, and the largest maximum size corresponds\nto compact grains with the highest tensile strength.

Quantifying this phenomena is key to our correct interpretation of\nexoplanet atmospheric properties. We obtained long-slit optical spectroscopy of\ntwo transits of HAT-P-11b with the Optical System for Imaging and\nlow-Intermediate-Resolution Integrated Spectroscopy (OSIRIS) at Gran Telescopio\nCanarias (GTC) on August 30 2016 and September 25 2017. We integrated the\nspectrum of HAT-P-11 and one reference star in several spectroscopic channels\nacross the $\\lambda\\sim$ 400-785 nm region, creating numerous light curves of\nthe transits. We fit analytic transit curves to the data taking into account\nthe systematic effects and red noise present in the time series in an effort to\nmeasure the change of the planet-to-star radius ratio\n($R_\\mathrm{p}/R_\\mathrm{s}$) across wavelength. By fitting both transits\ntogether, we find a slope in the transmission spectrum showing an increase of\nthe planetary radius towards blue wavelengths. A closer inspection to the\ntransmission spectrum of the individual data sets reveals that the first\ntransit presents this slope while the transmission spectrum of the second data\nset is flat. Additionally we detect hints of Na absorption in the first night,\nbut not in the second. We conclude that the transmission spectrum slope and Na\nabsorption excess found in the first transit observation are caused by\nunocculted stellar spots.

The onset of GIs in the\ncircumbinary disc is much more violent due to the stimulation of a strong\none-armed density wave by the brown dwarf.

We find that except for in the very inner regions, the\ntorques are well-described by a power law of the form $\\tau \\propto r^{-2.5}$.\nThe magnitude of the torque is large enough for the entire disk to react to the\ntorque in less than the Hubble time. We demonstrate analytically that disks\nwhich are originally located in the $xy$-plane and which are subjected to a\ntorque around the x-axis tilt around the y-axis, as also found in fully\nnon-linear N-body simulations.

The role of the various rotationally induced hydrodynamic\ninstabilities for the transport of angular momentum inside the white dwarf is\ninvestigated. We find that the dynamical shear instability is the most\nimportant one in the highly degenerate core. Our results imply that accreting\nwhite dwarfs rotate differentially throughout,with a shear rate close to the\nthreshold value for the onset of the dynamical shear instability. As the latter\ndepends on the temperature of the white dwarf, the thermal evolution of the\nwhite dwarf core is found to be relevant for the angular momentum\nredistribution.

Extreme conditions in gamma ray bursters lead to\nhighly relativistic motions (bulk Lorentz factors Gamma > 100). This results in\nstrong forward beaming of the emitted radiation in the observer's rest frame.\nThus, all information on gamma ray bursts comes from those ejecta emitted in a\nnarrow cone (opening angle 1/Gamma) pointing towards the observer. We are at\npresent ignorant of whether there are ejecta outside that cone or not.\n  The recent detection of longer wavelength transients following gamma ray\nbursts allows an empirical test of whether gamma ray bursts are collimated jets\nor spherical fireballs. The bulk Lorentz factor of the burst ejecta will\ndecrease with time after the event, as the ejecta sweep up the surrounding\nmedium. Thus, radiation from the ejecta is beamed into an ever increasing solid\nangle as the burst remnant evolves. It follows that if gamma ray bursts are\nhighly collimated, many more optical and radio transients should be observed\nwithout associated gamma rays than with them.
