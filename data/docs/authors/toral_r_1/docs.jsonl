The spatially extended\nphytoplankton-zooplankton system is from the original study by Scheffer [M\nScheffer, Fish and nutrients interplay determines algal biomass: a minimal\nmodel, Oikos \\textbf{62} (1991) 271-282]. Our results show that the spatially\nextended system exhibit a resonant patterns and frequency-locking phenomena.\nThe system also shows that the noise and the external periodic forces play a\nconstructive role in the Scheffer's model: first, the noise can enhance the\noscillation of phytoplankton species' density and format a large clusters in\nthe space when the noise intensity is within certain interval. Second, the\nexternal periodic forces can induce 4:1 and 1:1 frequency-locking and spatially\nhomogeneous oscillation phenomena to appear. Finally, the resonant patterns are\nobserved in the system when the spatial noises and external periodic forces are\nboth turned on.

This can be illuminated in particular by an example of\nBrownian motion in an ohmic environment where the dissipative effect can be\naccounted for by the first-order time derivative of the position. Here we\nexplore the dynamics of the Brownian particle coupled to a supraohmic\nenvironment by considering the motion of a charged particle interacting with\nthe electromagnetic fluctuations at finite temperature. We also derive\nparticle's equation of motion, the Langevin equation, by minimizing the\ncorresponding stochastic effective action, which is obtained with the method of\nFeynman-Vernon influence functional. The fluctuation-dissipation theorem is\nestablished from first principles. The backreaction on the charge is known in\nterms of electromagnetic self-force given by a third-order time derivative of\nthe position, leading to the supraohmic dynamics. This self-force can be argued\nto be insignificant throughout the evolution when the charge barely moves.

The tuning curves are stationary, i.e. time\nindependent, solutions of this dynamical model. One important assumption\nunderlying the Ring Model is that the LGN input to V1 is weakly tuned to the\nretinal orientation and that it is the local computations in V1 that sharpen\nthis tuning. Because the equations that describe the Ring Model have built-in\nequivariance properties in the synaptic weight distribution with respect to a\nparticular group acting on the retinal orientation of the stimulus, the model\nin effect encodes an infinite number of tuning curves that are arbitrarily\ntranslated with respect to each other. By using the Orbit Space Reduction\ntechnique we rewrite the model equations in canonical form as functions of\npolynomials that are invariant with respect to the action of this group. This\nallows us to combine equivariant bifurcation theory with an efficient numerical\ncontinuation method in order to compute the tuning curves predicted by the Ring\nModel. Surprisingly some of these tuning curves are not tuned to the stimulus.\nWe interpret them as neural illusions and show numerically how they can be\ninduced by simple dynamical stimuli.

The authors purport that any bidirectional network with\none-dimensional intrinsic node dynamics can be fully controlled by a single\ndriver node, which can be any node in the network, regardless of the network\ntopology. According to this result, a network with an arbitrarily large number\nof nodes (a million, a billion, or even more) could be controlled by a single\nnode. Here we show, however, that this result is specious and that it does not\nhold true even for networks with only two nodes. We demonstrate that the\nerroneous results are a consequence of a fundamental flaw in the proposed\nmethod, namely, that reaching a local desired state using the proposed\nlinearization procedure generally requires a nonlocal trajectory, which grossly\nviolates the linear approximation. Their further conclusion that network\nsystems with nonlinear dynamics are more controllable than those with linear\ndynamics is a known fact presented as novel based on a flawed argument.

Namely, the neuron learns to be more prone to generate spikes given\nthose combinations of firing input neurons for which a previous spiking of the\nneuron had been followed by a positive global reward signal. The reward signal\nmay be mediated by certain modulatory hormones or neurotransmitters, e.g., the\ndopamine. More generally, a trial-and-error learning paradigm is suggested in\nwhich a global reward signal triggers long-term enhancement or weakening of a\nneuron's spiking response to the preceding neuronal input firing pattern. Thus,\nrewards provide a feedback pathway that informs neurons whether their spiking\nwas beneficial or detrimental for a particular input combination. The neuron's\nability to discern specific combinations of firing input neurons is achieved\nthrough a random or predetermined spatial distribution of input synapses on\ndendrites that creates synaptic clusters that represent various permutations of\ninput neurons.

This scenario\nthough looks very appealing is still far from being well established. One of\nthe main differences between standard spin systems to molecular systems is the\nabsence of quenched disorder and the presence of translational invariance: it\noften assumed that this difference is not relevant, but this conjecture is\nstill far from being established. The quantities, which are well defined and\ncharacterized for spin models, are not easily calculable for molecular glasses\ndue to the lack of quenched disorder which breaks the translational invariance\nin the system and the characterization of the similarity between the spin and\nthe structural glass transition remained an elusive subject still now. In this\nstudy we introduced a model structural glass with built in quenched disorder\nwhich alleviates this main difference between the spin and molecular glasses\nthereby helping us to compare these two systems: the possibility of producing a\ngood thermalization at rather low temperatures is one of the advantages of this\nmodel. \n\n"}

The definition of modularity involves a comparison of\nwithin-community edges in the observed network and that number in an equivalent\nrandomized network. This equivalent randomized network is called the null\nmodel, which serves as a reference. To make the comparison significant, the\nnull model should characterize some features of the observed network. However,\nthe null model in the original definition of modularity is unrealistically\nmixed, in the sense that any node can be linked to any other node without\npreference and only connectivity matters. Thus, it fails to be a good\nrepresentation of real-world networks. A common feature of many real-world\nnetworks is \"similarity attraction\", i.e., edges tend to link to nodes that are\nsimilar to each other.

The discovery of the fluctuation relations has spurred\ntheoretical and experimental studies on thermodynamics of systems with few\ndegrees of freedom. The concept of entropy production has been extended to the\nmicroscopic level by considering stochastic trajectories of a system coupled to\na heat bath. However, the experimental observation of the microscopic entropy\nproduction remains elusive. We measure distributions of the microscopic entropy\nproduction in a single-electron box consisting of two islands with a tunnel\njunction. The islands are coupled to separate heat baths at different\ntemperatures, maintaining a steady thermal non-equilibrium. As Jarzynski\nequality between work and free energy is not applicable in this case, the\nentropy production becomes the relevant parameter.

Non-linear\nintegrations of this model show that as the energy input rate of the forcing is\nincreased, the homogeneity of the flow is broken with the emergence of\nnon-zonal, coherent, westward propagating structures and at larger energy input\nrates by the emergence of zonal jets.

The second hypothesis\nconcerns the link between this internal coordinate system and the usual\nthermodynamic variables. This link is represented by an extra relation between\ntwo variables pertaining to the two descriptions; to be illustrative a scaling\nlaw has been introduced relating external and internal volumes. In addition, we\nuse an axiomatic description based on the approach of the second law of\nthermodynamics proposed by E. Lieb and J. Yngvason (Physics Reports 310,\n1999,1).

Here we present a simple model of cascading failure on multiplex\nnetworks of weight-heterogeneous layers. By simulating the model on the\nmultiplex network of international trades, we found that the multiplex model\nproduces more catastrophic cascading failures which are the result of emergent\ncollective effect of coupling layers, rather than the simple sum thereof.\nTherefore risks can be systematically underestimated in single-layer network\nanalyses because the impact of weak layers can be overlooked.

We find that\nthere is a spatiotemporal scale at which effective information peaks in the\ncardiac system with rotors.

Here we characterize computational capability of AQC with\nstoquastic Hamiltonians, which we call stoqAQC. We construct a concrete stoqAQC\nmodel, whose lowest energy gap is lower bounded polynomially, and hence the\nfinal state can be obtained in polynomial time. Then we show that it can\nsimulate universal quantum computation if adaptive single-qubit measurements in\nnon-standard bases are allowed on the final state. Even if the measurements are\nrestricted to non-adaptive measurements to respect the robustness of AQC, the\nproposed model exhibits quantum computational supremacy; classical simulation\nis impossible under complexity theoretical conjectures. Moreover, it is found\nthat such a stoqAQC model can simulate Shor's algorithm and solve the factoring\nproblem in polynomial time. We also propose how to overcome the measurement\nimperfections via quantum error correction within the stoqAQC model and also an\nexperimentally feasible verification scheme to test whether or not stoqAQC is\ndone faithfully. \n\n"}

When in the\nFokker-Planck equation the diffusion coefficient is positive (nonzero) and the\ndrift term is bounded, as in the case of a Brownian walker, both distributions\nmay exhibit a power-law decay with exponent -3/2 for intermediate times.

Remarkably, the exponent of the Brownian walker class of\nmodels is still found, as long as the departure and arrival regions are far\nenough from the absorbing state, but the range of times where the power law is\nobserved narrows.

Although these solutions are repeatedly\nconsidered as solitary waves (and even solitons), their temporal stability has\nnever been proven. In this paper, a numerical study of the Vlasov-Poisson\nsystem is made to follow their temporal evolution in the presence of numerical\nnoise and thereby test their long-time propagation stability. Considering the\nion-acoustic regime, both constituents of the plasma, i.e. electrons and ions\nare treated following their distribution functions in these set of fully\nkinetic simulations. The findings reveal that the stability of Sagdeev solution\ndepends on a combination of two parameters, i.e. velocity and trapping\nparameter.

Abstract: Despite a mounting evidence that the same gradients which active colloids use\nfor swimming, induce important cross-interactions (phoretic interaction), they\nare still ignored in most many-body descriptions, perhaps to avoid complexity\nand a zoo of unknown parameters. Here we derive a simple model, which reduces\nphoretic far-field interactions to a pair-interaction whose strength is mainly\ncontrolled by one genuine parameter (swimming speed). The model suggests that\nphoretic interactions are generically important for autophoretic colloids\n(unless effective screening of the phoretic fields is strong) and should\ndominate over hydrodynamic interactions for the typical case of half-coating\nand moderately nonuniform surface mobilities. Unlike standard minimal models,\nbut in accordance with canonical experiments, our model generically predicts\ndynamic clustering in active colloids at low density.

Remarkably, the past decade has let to the\ndevelopment of synthetic microswimmers like e.g. autophoretic Janus colloids,\nwhich can self-propel through a solvent, analogously to bacteria and other\nmicroorganims. The mechanism underlying their self-propulsion involves the\nproduction of certain chemicals. The same chemicals involved in the\nself-propulsion mechanism also act on other microswimmers and bias their\nswimming direction towards (or away from) the producing microswimmer. Synthetic\nmicroswimmers therefore provide a synthetic analogue to chemotactic motile\nmicroorganisms.

Existing microscopic cascade prediction models which focus on\nuser-level modeling either make strong assumptions on how a user gets infected\nby a cascade or limit themselves to a specific scenario where \"who infected\nwhom\" information is explicitly labeled. The strong assumptions oversimplify\nthe complex diffusion mechanism and prevent these models from better fitting\nreal-world cascade data. Also, the methods which focus on specific scenarios\ncannot be generalized to a general setting where the diffusion graph is\nunobserved.\n  To overcome the drawbacks of previous works, we propose a Neural Diffusion\nModel (NDM) for general microscopic cascade prediction.

The sexual activity of each individual, measured by its degree, is not\nhomogeneous but obeys a power-law distribution.

Many studies have discovered\npatterns in static graphs, identifying properties in a single snapshot of a\nlarge network, or in a very small number of snapshots; these include heavy\ntails for in- and out-degree distributions, communities, small-world phenomena,\nand others. However, given the lack of information about network evolution over\nlong periods, it has been hard to convert these findings into statements about\ntrends over time.\n  Here we study a wide range of real graphs, and we observe some surprising\nphenomena. First, most of these graphs densify over time, with the number of\nedges growing super-linearly in the number of nodes. Second, the average\ndistance between nodes often shrinks over time, in contrast to the conventional\nwisdom that such distance parameters should increase slowly as a function of\nthe number of nodes (like O(log n) or O(log(log n)).\n  Existing graph generation models do not exhibit these types of behavior, even\nat a qualitative level. We provide a new graph generator, based on a ``forest\nfire'' spreading process, that has a simple, intuitive justification, requires\nvery few parameters (like the ``flammability'' of nodes), and produces graphs\nexhibiting the full range of properties observed both in prior work and in the\npresent study.\n  We also notice that the ``forest fire'' model exhibits a sharp transition\nbetween sparse graphs and graphs that are densifying.

Contrary to the\nprevious studies, which showed that measurements induce a diffusive probability\nspreading, our results demonstrate that localization can be preserved for\nrepeated single-qubit measurements.

{"id": "quant-ph/0507145", "contents": "Title: Explanation of the Gibbs paradox within the framework of quantum\n  thermodynamics Abstract: The issue of the Gibbs paradox is that when considering mixing of two gases\nwithin classical thermodynamics, the entropy of mixing appears to be a\ndiscontinuous function of the difference between the gases: it is finite for\nwhatever small difference, but vanishes for identical gases. The resolution\noffered in the literature, with help of quantum mixing entropy, was later shown\nto be unsatisfactory precisely where it sought to resolve the paradox.\nMacroscopic thermodynamics, classical or quantum, is unsuitable for explaining\nthe paradox, since it does not deal explicitly with the difference between the\ngases. The proper approach employs quantum thermodynamics, which deals with\nfinite quantum systems coupled to a large bath and a macroscopic work source.\nWithin quantum thermodynamics, entropy generally looses its dominant place and\nthe target of the paradox is naturally shifted to the decrease of the maximally\navailable work before and after mixing (mixing ergotropy). In contrast to\nentropy this is an unambiguous quantity. For almost identical gases the mixing\nergotropy continuously goes to zero, thus resolving the paradox. In this\napproach the concept of ``difference between the gases'' gets a clear\noperational meaning related to the possibilities of controlling the involved\nquantum states. Difficulties which prevent resolutions of the paradox in its\nentropic formulation do not arise here. The mixing ergotropy has several\ncounter-intuitive features. It can increase when less precise operations are\nallowed. In the quantum situation (in contrast to the classical one) the mixing\nergotropy can also increase when decreasing the degree of mixing between the\ngases, or when decreasing their distinguishability. These points go against a\ndirect association of physical irreversibility with lack of information. \n\n"}

The interaction between the dipoles and the classical\nfields induces a time-varying Aharonov-Casher phase. Averaging over the phase\ngenerates a suppression of fringe visibility in the interference pattern. We\nshow that, for suitable experimental conditions, the loss of contrast for\ndipoles can be observable and almost as large as the corresponding one for\ncoherent electrons.

{"id": "quant-ph/0609149", "contents": "Title: Novel schemes for measurement-based quantum computation Abstract: We establish a framework which allows one to construct novel schemes for\nmeasurement-based quantum computation. The technique further develops tools\nfrom many-body physics - based on finitely correlated or projected entangled\npair states - to go beyond the cluster-state based one-way computer. We\nidentify resource states that are radically different from the cluster state,\nin that they exhibit non-vanishing correlation functions, can partly be\nprepared using gates with non-maximal entangling power, or have very different\nlocal entanglement properties. In the computational models, the randomness is\ncompensated in a different manner. It is shown that there exist resource states\nwhich are locally arbitrarily close to a pure state. Finally, we comment on the\npossibility of tailoring computational models to specific physical systems as,\ne.g. cold atoms in optical lattices. \n\n"}
{"id": "quant-ph/0611264", "contents": "Title: Statistics dependence of the entanglement entropy Abstract: The entanglement entropy of a distinguished region of a quantum many-body\nsystem reflects the entanglement present in its pure ground state. In this\nwork, we establish scaling laws for this entanglement for critical quasi-free\nfermionic and bosonic lattice systems, without resorting to numerical means. We\nconsider the geometrical setting of D-dimensional half-spaces which allows us\nto exploit a connection to the one-dimensional case. Intriguingly, we find a\ndifference in the scaling properties depending on whether the system is bosonic\n- where an area-law is first proven to hold - or fermionic, extending previous\nfindings for cubic regions. For bosonic systems with nearest neighbor\ninteraction we prove the conjectured area-law by computing the logarithmic\nnegativity analytically. We identify a length scale associated with\nentanglement, different from the correlation length. For fermions we determine\nthe logarithmic correction to the area-law, which depends on the topology of\nthe Fermi surface. We find that Lifshitz quantum phase transitions are\naccompanied with a non-analyticity in the prefactor of the leading order term. \n\n"}
