For very rapidly rotating black holes (spin\na=J/M>0.9524M) we have found a class of very strong field eccentric orbits\nwhose angular momentum L_z increases with the orbit's inclination with respect\nto the equatorial plane, while keeping latus rectum and eccentricity fixed.\nThis behavior is in contrast with Newtonian intuition, and is in fact opposite\nto the \"normal\" behavior of black hole orbits. Such behavior was noted\npreviously for circular orbits; since it only applies to orbits very close to\nthe black hole, they were named \"nearly horizon-skimming orbits\". Our analysis\ngeneralizes this result, mapping out the full generic (inclined and eccentric)\nfamily of nearly horizon-skimming orbits. The earlier work on circular orbits\nreported that, under gravitational radiation emission, nearly horizon-skimming\norbits tend to evolve to smaller orbit inclination, toward prograde equatorial\nconfiguration. Normal orbits, by contrast, always demonstrate slowly growing\norbit inclination (orbits evolve toward the retrograde equatorial\nconfiguration). Using up-to-date Teukolsky-fluxes, we have concluded that the\nearlier result was incorrect: all circular orbits, including nearly\nhorizon-skimming ones, exhibit growing orbit inclination. Using kludge fluxes\nbased on a Post-Newtonian expansion corrected with fits to circular and to\nequatorial Teukolsky-fluxes, we argue that the inclination grows also for\neccentric nearly horizon-skimming orbits. We also find that the inclination\nchange is, in any case, very small. As such, we conclude that these orbits are\nnot likely to have a clear and peculiar imprint on the gravitational waveforms\nexpected to be measured by the space-based detector LISA. \n\n"}

In\nour analysis, we pursue the simplest physical description of the dominant\nfeatures in the radiation, providing an interpretation of the waveforms in\nterms of an {\\em implicit rotating source}. This interpretation applies\nuniformly to the full wave train, from inspiral through ringdown. We emphasize\nstrong relationships among the $\\ell=m$ modes that persist through the full\nwave train. Exploring the structure of the waveforms in more detail, we conduct\ndetailed analytic fitting of the late-time frequency evolution, identifying a\nkey quantitative feature shared by the $\\ell=m$ modes among all mass ratios. We\nidentify relationships, with a simple interpretation in terms of the implicit\nrotating source, among the evolution of frequency and amplitude, which hold for\nthe late-time radiation. These detailed relationships provide sufficient\ninformation about the late-time radiation to yield a predictive model for the\nlate-time waveforms, an alternative to the common practice of modeling by a sum\nof quasinormal mode overtones.

We\nstudy how the accuracy with which the WIMP mass could be determined by a single\ndirect detection experiment depends on the detector configuration and the WIMP\nproperties. We investigate the effects of varying the underlying WIMP mass and\ncross-section, the detector target nucleus, exposure, energy threshold and\nmaximum energy, the local circular speed and the background event rate and\nspectrum. The number of events observed is directly proportional to both the\nexposure and the cross-section, therefore these quantities have the greatest\nbearing on the accuracy of the WIMP mass determination. The relative\ncapabilities of different detectors to determine the WIMP mass depend not only\non the WIMP and target masses, but also on their energy thresholds. We find\nthat the rapid decrease of the nuclear form factor with increasing momentum\ntransfer which occurs for heavy nuclei, means that heavy nuclei will not\nnecessarily be able to measure the mass of heavy WIMPs more accurately.\nUncertainty in the local circular speed and non-negligible background would\nboth lead to systematic errors in the WIMP mass determination.

The starting point is the parametrized\nMinkowski theory describing the system in arbitrary admissible non-inertial\nframes in Minkowski space-time, which allows one to define the energy-momentum\ntensor of the system and to show the independence of the description from the\nclock synchronization convention and from the choice of the 3-coordinates. In\nthe inertial rest frame the isolated system is seen as a decoupled\nnon-covariant canonical external center of mass carrying a pole-dipole\nstructure (the invariant mass $M$ and the rest spin ${\\vec {\\bar S}}$ of the\nsystem) and an external realization of the Poincare' group.

In this paper, we\nstudy the connection between self-acceleration and the presence of ghosts for a\nquite generic class of theories that modify gravity in the infrared. These\ntheories are defined as those that at distances shorter than cosmological,\nreduce to a certain generalization of the DGP 4D effective theory. We argue\nthat for infrared modifications of GR locally due to a universally coupled\nscalar, our generalization is the only one that allows for a robust\nimplementation of the Vainshtein effect--the decoupling of the scalar from\nmatter in gravitationally bound systems--necessary to recover agreement with\nsolar system tests.

Once the semimajor axis shrinks below a\ncritical value, angular momentum losses from gravitational waves dominate over\nviscous transport in hardening the binary. The inner disk then no longer\nresponds viscously to the inspiraling black holes. Instead, tidal interactions\nwith the secondary rapidly drive the inner disk into the primary.

We study whether generic scalar-tensor\n(ST) theories can be further constrained with EMRIs. We show that in the EMRI\nlimit, all such theories universally reduce to massive or massless Brans-Dicke\ntheory and that black holes do not emit dipolar radiation to all orders in\npost-Newtonian (PN) theory. For massless theories, we calculate the scalar\nenergy flux in the Teukolsky formalism to all orders in PN theory and fit it to\na high-order PN expansion. We derive the PN ST corrections to the Fourier\ntransform of the gravitational wave response and map it to the parameterized\npost-Einsteinian framework. We use the effective-one-body framework adapted to\nEMRIs to calculate the ST modifications to the gravitational waveform. We find\nthat such corrections are smaller than those induced in the early inspiral of\ncomparable-mass binaries, leading to projected bounds on the coupling that are\nworse than current Solar System ones. Brans-Dicke theory modifies the\nweak-field, with deviations in the energy flux that are largest at small\nvelocities. For massive theories, superradiance can lead to resonances in the\nscalar energy flux that can lead to floating orbits outside the innermost\nstable circular orbit and that last until the supermassive black hole loses\nenough mass and spin-angular momentum. If such floating orbits occur in the\nfrequency band of LISA, they would lead to a large dephasing (~1e6 rads),\npreventing detection with GR templates. A detection that is consistent with GR\nwould then rule out floating resonances at frequencies lower than the lowest\nobserved frequency, allowing for the strongest constraints yet on massive ST\ntheories. \n\n"}

As the\nsensitivity of Advanced LIGO and Virgo increases in the next few years, they\nwill eventually detect stellar-mass BBHs up to redshifts of ~1. However, these\nare still relatively small distances compared with the size of the Universe, or\nwith those encountered in most areas of astrophysics.

In two of the four events, GW150914, and the recent\nGW170104, the observed spins are most likely negative (but consistent with\nzero). In the third case LVT151012 it is practically zero and only in the forth\ncase, GW151226, the spin is positive but low. These observations are puzzling\nwithin the field binary scenario in which positive higher spins are expected.\nConsidering the most favorable Wolfe Rayet (WR) progenitors we estimate the\nexpected spin distribution for different evolution scenarios and compare it to\nthe observations. With typical parameters one expects a significant fraction\n($\\ge 25\\%$) of the mergers to have high effective spin values. However due to\nuncertainties in the outcome of the common envelope phase (typical separation\nand whether the stars are rotating or not) and in the late stages of massive\nstar evolution (the strength of the winds) one cannot rule our scenarios in\nwhich the expected spins are low. While observations of high effective spin\nevents will support this scenario, further observations of negative spin events\nwould rule it out. \n\n"}

Introduction of\n$C^0$-class functions leads to the appearance of the additional delta-like\nsources in the Einstein equations and in the equations for quantum particles.\nTherefore, to explore the horizon region, in addition to the classical geodesic\nequations, one needs to use equation of quantum particles.

The magnitude of this damping, evaluated by Bildsten and\nUshomirsky (BU) under the assumption of a perfectly rigid crust, sets the\nmaximum spin frequency for a neutron star spun up by accretion in a Low-Mass\nX-ray binary (LMXB). In this paper we explore the mechanical coupling between\nthe core r-modes and the elastic crust, using a toy model of a constant density\nneutron star with a constant shear modulus crust. We find that, at spin\nfrequencies in excess of ~50 Hz, the r-modes strongly penetrate the crust. This\nreduces the relative motion (slippage) between the crust and the core compared\nto the rigid crust limit. We therefore revise down, by as much as a factor of\n10^2-10^3, the damping rate computed by BU, significantly reducing the maximal\npossible spin frequency of neutron star with a solid crust. The dependence of\nthe crust-core slippage on the spin frequency is complicated, and is very\nsensitive to the physical thickness of the crust. If the crust is sufficiently\nthick, the curve of the critical spin frequency for the onset of the r-mode\ninstability becomes multi-valued for some temperatures; this is related to the\navoided crossings between the r-mode and the higher-order torsional modes in\nthe crust.

The resonant energy\ntransfer between the orbit and NS speeds up or slows down the inspiral and\ninduces a phase change in the emitted gravitational waves from the binary. A\ntidal resonance, (jk,m), occurs when the mode frequency equals m times the\norbital frequency. For f-mode resonance to occur before coalescence, the NS\nmust have rapid rotation, with spin frequency nu_s>710Hz for (22,2)-resonance\nand nu_s>570Hz for (33,3)-resonance (M=1.4Mo and R=10km; however, for R=15km,\nthese spin frequencies become 330Hz and 250Hz). Because of strong tidal\ncoupling, f-mode resonances induce a large change in the number of orbital\ncycles, N_orb, with maximum N_orb~10-1000 for (22,2)-resonance and N_orb~1 for\n(33,3)- resonance. Such resonant effects, if present, must be included in\nconstructing waveform templates used in searching for gravitational wave\nsignals. Higher order f-mode resonances can occur at slower rotation rates, but\nN_orb<0.1. For the dominant g-mode (22,2)-resonance, even modest rotation\n(nu_s<100Hz) can enhance the resonant effect on the orbit by shifting resonance\nto a smaller orbital frequency. However, because of the weak coupling, N_orb\nlies in the range 10^-3-10^-2 (depending on the NS EOS) and is probably\nnegligible for the purpose of detecting gravitational waves. R-mode resonances\nrequire misaligned spin-orbit inclinations, and the dominant resonances\ncorrespond to (22,3) and (22,1). Since tidal coupling depends strongly on\nrotation rate, N_orb<10^-2(R/10km)^(10)(M/1.4Mo)^(-20/3) is negligible for\ncanonical NS parameters but can be appreciable if the NS radius is larger. \n\n"}

The orbits of the\ninspiraling COs are highly complicated; they can remain rather eccentric up\nuntil the final plunge, and display extreme versions of relativistic perihelion\nprecession and Lense-Thirring precession of the orbital plane.

The associated template waveforms are not yet in\nhand, but theorists will very likely be able to provide them before LISA\nlaunches.

Often,\nonly special types of singularities such as the curvature singularities found\nin isotropic cosmological models are discussed and it is far from clear what\nthis implies for the very general singularities that arise according to the\nsingularity theorems of general relativity. In these lectures we present an\noverview of the current status of singularities in classical and quantum\ngravity, starting with a review and interpretation of the classical singularity\ntheorems. This suggests possible routes for quantum gravity to evade the\ndevastating conclusion of the theorems by different means, including modified\ndynamics or modified geometrical structures underlying quantum gravity.

Assuming the\nfinite differencing scheme commutes with linearization, we show how the\nJacobian elements may be computed by first linearizing the continuum $H(h)$\nequations, then finite differencing the linearized (continuum) equations.\n  We find this symbolic differentiation method of computing the $H(h)$ Jacobian\nto be {\\em much} more efficient than the usual numerical perturbation method,\nand also much easier to implement than is commonly thought.\n  When solving the discrete $H(h) = 0$ equations, we find that Newton's method\ngenerally converges very rapidly. However, if the initial guess for the horizon\nposition contains significant high-spatial-frequency error components, Newton's\nmethod has a small (poor) radius of convergence.

To take into account this generic possibility, it is necessary to\ndemand that \\emph{physical theories in a given coordinate system must be\nformulated entirely in terms of variables that an observer using that\ncoordinate system can access}. This principle is powerful enough to obtain the\nfollowing results: (a) The action principle of gravity must be of such a\nstructure that, in the semiclassical limit, the action of the unobserved\ndegrees of freedom reduces to a boundary contribution $A_{\\rm boundary}$\nobtained by integrating a four divergence.

Abstract: We argue that TeVeS-like vector fields appear naturally in certain string\ntheory backgrounds involving D0-branes, as a result of the recoil velocity\nfield, expressing the interaction of neutrino string matter with point-like\nbranes. However, the similarity with TeVeS models is restricted only to the\nbi-metric properties of space time, namely the difference of the background\nmetric from the one felt by (some) matter fields interacting, in a\ntopologically non-trivial manner, with the D0-brane defects. In our approach,\nneutrinos appear as dark matter candidates that could be ``captured'' by the D0\nbranes, as a result of stringy properties, and thus couple with the\nrecoil-vector fields. Moreover, we argue in support of a possibly preferential\nrole of neutrinos in inducing novel non-perturbative contributions to\n``vacuum'' (dark) energy, in addition to their ordinary dark matter\ncontribution. In fact, the role of neutrinos as providing substantial\ncontributions to dark matter and dark energy components of the Universe,\nsuggested by our approach, appears also to be necessitated by the need to\nreproduce the peaks in the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation spectrum, as\nclaimed recently in the literature.
