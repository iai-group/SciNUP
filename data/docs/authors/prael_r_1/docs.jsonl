The tail emission which we consider\nis identified as a steep-decay component of the early X-ray afterglow observed\nby the X-ray Telescope onboard Swift. Using a Monte Carlo method, we derive,\nfor the first time, the distribution of the decay index of the GRB tail\nemission for various jet models.

These definitions for\nfitting the light curve lead us an unique definition of the decay index, which\nis useful to investigate the structure of the GRB jet. We find that if the GRB\njet has a core-envelope structure, the predicted distribution of the decay\nindex of the tail has a wide scatter and has multiple peaks, which cannot be\nseen for the case of the uniform and the Gaussian jet. Therefore, the decay\nindex distribution tells us the information on the jet structure.

This\nlength is by definition the relaxation length of the slowest mode toward\nequilibrium transport. The model presented by Parteli, Duran and Herrmann\n[Phys. Rev. E 75, 011301 (2007)] predicts that the saturation length decreases\nto zero as the inverse of the wind shear stress far from the threshold. We\nfirst show that their model is not self-consistent: even under large wind, the\nrelaxation rate is limited by grain inertia and thus can not decrease to zero.\nA key argument presented by these authors comes from the discussion of the\ntypical dune wavelength on Mars (650 m) on the basis of which they refute the\nscaling of the dune size with the drag length evidenced by Claudin and\nAndreotti [Earth Pla. Sci. Lett. 252, 30 (2006)]. They instead propose that\nMartian dunes, composed of large grains (500 micrometers), were formed in the\npast under very strong winds. We show that this saltating grain size, estimated\nfrom thermal diffusion measurements, is not reliable. Moreover, the microscopic\nphotographs taken by the rovers on Martian aeolian bedforms show a grain size\nof 87 plus or minus 25 micrometers together with hematite spherules at\nmillimetre scale. As those so-called ``blueberries'' can not be entrained by\nreasonable winds, we conclude that the saltating grains on Mars are the small\nones, which gives a second strong argument against the model of Parteli et al. \n\n"}

The Formation Efficiencies of Globular\n  Clusters in Early-Type Galaxies: The Effects of Mass and Environment Abstract: The fraction of stellar mass contained in globular clusters (GCs), also\nmeasured by number as the specific frequency, is a fundamental quantity that\nreflects both a galaxy's early star formation and its entire merging history.\nWe present specific frequencies, luminosities, and mass fractions for the\nglobular cluster systems of 100 early-type galaxies in the ACS Virgo Cluster\nSurvey, the largest homogeneous catalog of its kind. We find that 1) GC mass\nfractions can be high in both giants and dwarfs, but are universally low in\ngalaxies with intermediate luminosities. 2) The behavior of specific frequency\nacross galaxy mass is dominated by the blue GCs. 3) The GC fractions of\nlow-mass galaxies exhibit a dependence on environment. Nearly all dwarf\ngalaxies with high GC fractions are within 1 Mpc of the cD galaxy M87,\npresenting the first strong evidence that GC formation in dwarfs is biased\ntoward dense environments. 4) GC formation in central dwarfs is biased because\ntheir stars form earliest and most intensely. Comparisons to the Millennium\nSimulation show that central dwarfs have older stellar populations and form\nmore stars at higher star formation rates (SFRs) and SFR surface densities. The\nSFR surface density in simulated dwarfs peaks before the total SFR, naturally\nproducing GC populations that are older and more metal-poor than the field\nstars. 5) Dwarfs within ~40 kpc of the giant ellipticals M87 and M49 are red\nand have few or no GCs, suggesting that they have been tidally stripped and\nhave contributed their GCs to the halos of their giant neighbors. The central\ndwarfs with high GC mass fractions are thus likely to be the survivors most\nsimilar to the protogalaxies that assembled the rich M87 globular cluster\nsystem.(Abridged) \n\n"}

The broad-band spectrum is well represented by a\nthree-component model, accompanied by both a strong iron Ka line with an\nequivalent width of ~ 1.8 keV and several weak lines.

We find that the combination of H-alpha and total infrared\nluminosities provides the most robust SFR measurements, but combinations of\nH-alpha measurements with monochromatic luminosities at 24 micron and 8 micron\nperform nearly as well. The calibrations differ significantly from those\nobtained for HII regions (Calzetti et al. 2007), with the difference\nattributable to a more evolved population of stars heating the dust. Our\nresults are consistent with a significant component of diffuse dust (the `IR\ncirrus' component) that is heated by a non-star-forming population. The same\nmethodology can be applied to [OII]$\\lambda$3727 emission-line measurements,\nand the radio continuum fluxes of galaxies can be applied in place of IR fluxes\nwhen the latter are not available.

Taking advantage of the total absorption of the QSO\nlight bluewards of the Lyman limit of two DLAs at z>3.4, we look for the\ncontinuum emission from intervening galaxies at z~2 that are identified via\nstrong metal absorption lines. The MgII absorbers have equivalent width large\nenough to be potential DLA systems. Deep images are obtained with the FOcal\nReducer and Spectrograph (FORS1) on the Very Large Telescope for the fields\ntowards SDSS J110855+120953 and SDSS J140850+020522.

The\nU and R bands of FORS1 lie blue and redwards of the Lyman limit of the\nbackground DLAs, allowing us to search for emission from the foreground\ngalaxies directly along the lines of sight to the QSOs.

Although the dust in disks is\nrelatively easily detected as a far-IR photometric ``excess'' over the expected\nphotospheric emission, much less is known about the gas phase. It seems clear\nthat an abrupt transition from massive optically thick disks (gas-rich\nstructures where only ~1% of the total mass is in the form of dust) to tenuous\ndebris disks almost devoid of gas occurs at ~10^7 years, by which time the\nmajority of at least the giant planets must have formed. Indeed, these planets\nare largely gaseous and thus they must assemble before the gas disk dissipates.\nSpectroscopic studies of the disk gas content at different evolutive stages are\nthus critical. Far-IR water vapor lines and atomic fine structure lines from\nabundant gas reservoirs (e.g., [OI]63um, [SI]56um, [SiII]34um) are robust\ntracers of the gas in disks.

Stringy constructions of RS-like theories allow us to\ninvestigate the mass of these string states, which typically grows with a small\nfractional power of the number of colors N of the dual gauge theory. There are\ntwo known strong constraints on N for RS-like theories. The first arises from\ndemanding that the Standard Model gauge couplings do not have a Landau pole at\nlow scales.

HCO+ emission is a star\nformation indicator similar to HCN, tracing dense molecular hydrogen gas (n(H2)\n~= 10^5 cm^-3) within star-forming molecular clouds. We derive a\nlensing-corrected HCO+(J=4-3) line luminosity of L'(HCO+(4-3)) = (1.6+/-0.3) x\n10^9 (mu_L/11)^-1 K km/s pc^2, which corresponds to only 48% of the HCO+(J=1=0)\nluminosity, and <~4% of the CO(J=3-2) luminosity. The HCO+ excitation thus is\nclearly subthermal in the J=4-3 transition. Modeling of the HCO+ line radiative\ntransfer suggests that the HCO+ emission emerges from a region with physical\nproperties comparable to that exhibiting the CO line emission, but 2x higher\ngas density. This suggests that both HCO+ and CO lines trace the warm, dense\nmolecular gas where star formation actively takes place. The HCO+ lines have\nonly ~2/3 the width of the CO lines, which may suggest that the densest gas is\nmore spatially concentrated. In contrast to the z=3.91 quasar APM08279+5255,\nthe dense gas excitation in the Cloverleaf is consistent with being purely\ncollisional, rather than being enhanced by radiative processes. Thus, the\nphysical properties of the dense gas component in the Cloverleaf are consistent\nwith those in the nuclei of nearby starburst galaxies.

In a recent paper, M\\\"uller, Peters and Chu [Nature {\\bf 463},\n926-929 (2010)] argued that atom interferometers also provide a very accurate\ntest of the gravitational redshift when considering the atom as a clock\noperating at the Compton frequency associated with the rest mass. We analyze\nthis claim in the frame of general relativity and of different alternative\ntheories. We show that the difference of \"Compton phases\" between the two paths\nof the interferometer is actually zero in a large class of theories, including\ngeneral relativity, all metric theories of gravity, most non-metric theories\nand most theoretical frameworks used to interpret the violations of the\nequivalence principle. Therefore, in most plausible theoretical frameworks,\nthere is no redshift effect and atom interferometers only test the universality\nof free fall.

Since a new\nsource of {$ CP$} violation outside of that observed in the $K$ and $B$ meson\nsystems is needed to help explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe,\nsearches for EDMs are being carried out worldwide on a number of systems. The\nstandard-model value of the EDM is immeasurably small, so any evidence for an\nEDM would signify the observation of new physics. Unique opportunities exist\nfor EDM searches using polarized proton, deuteron or muon beams in storage\nrings. This talk will provide an overview of the theory of dipole moments, and\nthe relevant experiments. The connection to the transition dipole moment that\ncould produce lepton flavor violating interactions such as $\\mu^+ \\rightarrow\ne^+ \\gamma$ is also mentioned. \n\n"}

We investigate how a realistic red sequence population\nset up by z~1 evolves under different assumptions for the merger and star\nformation histories, comparing changes in color, luminosity and mass. The\npurely passive fading of existing red sequence galaxies, with no further\nmergers or star formation, results in dramatic changes at the bright end of the\nluminosity function and color-magnitude relation. Without mergers there is too\nmuch evolution in luminosity at a fixed space density compared to observations.\nThe change in color and magnitude at a fixed mass resemble that of a passively\nevolving population that formed relatively recently, at z~2. Mergers amongst\nthe red sequence population (\"dry mergers\") occurring after z=1 build up mass,\ncounteracting the fading of the existing stellar populations to give smaller\nchanges in both color and luminosity for massive galaxies. By allowing some\ngalaxies to migrate from the blue cloud onto the red sequence after z=1 through\ngas-rich mergers, younger stellar populations are added to the red sequence.\nThis manifestation of the progenitor bias increases the scatter in age and\nresults in even smaller changes in color and luminosity between z=1 and z=0 at\na fixed mass. The resultant evolution appears much slower, resembling the\npassive evolution of a population that formed at high redshift (z~3-5) and is\nin closer agreement with observations.

In the proposed approach,\nwe present a general procedure to construct the offline space that is used for\na systematic enrichment of the coarse solution space in the online stage.

We check if the\nevolution induced onto S0's by dry intermediate and minor mergers can reproduce\ntheir photometric scaling relations, analysing the bulge-disk decompositions of\nthe merger simulations presented in Eliche-Moral et al.

The mergers drive\nthe formation of the observed photometric relation in some cases, whereas they\ninduce a slight dispersion compatible with data in others. Therefore, this\nevolutionary mechanism tends to preserve these scaling relations. In those\nphotometric planes where the morphological types segregate, the mergers always\ninduce evolution towards the region populated by S0's. The structural coupling\nof the bulge and the disk is preserved or reinforced because the mergers\ntrigger internal secular processes in the primary disk that induce significant\nbulge growth, even although these models do not induce bars.

The two methods gave consistent\nresults, \\lambda=7+-8 deg and -0.5+-5.7 deg.\n  There are now a total of five obliquity measurements for host stars of\nsystems of multiple transiting planets, all of which are consistent with\nspin-orbit alignment.

The covariant properties of parity involve the\nJordan algebra of anti commutators of the Lorentz group generators which unlike\nthe Lie algebra is not universal. We make the construction explicit for\n$j=1/2,1$ and $3/2$, reproducing well-known results for the $j=1/2$ case. We\nprovide an algorithm for the corresponding calculations for arbitrary $j$. This\ncovariant basis provides an inventory of all the possible interaction terms for\ngauge and non-gauge theories of fields for these representations. In\nparticular, it supplies a single second rank antisymmetric structure, which in\nthe Poincar\\'e projector formalism implies a single Pauli term arising from\ngauge interactions and a single (free) parameter $g$, the gyromagnetic factor.\nThis simple structure predicts that for an elementary particle in this\nformalism all multipole moments, $Q^{l}_{E}$ and $Q^{l}_{M}$, are dictated by\nthe complete algebraic structure of the Lorentz generators and the value of\n$g$.

In\ncontrast, the spectrum of secondary positrons produced through the collisions\nof cosmic rays in the interstellar medium is predicted to fall rapidly with\nenergy, and thus is unable to account for the observed rise. It has been\nproposed, however, that secondary positrons could be produced and then\naccelerated in nearby supernova remnants, potentially explaining the observed\nrise, without the need of primary positron sources. Yet, if secondary positrons\nare accelerated in such shocks, other secondary cosmic ray species (such as\nboron nuclei, and antiprotons) will also be accelerated, leading to rises in\nthe boron-to-carbon and antiproton-to-proton ratios.

We consider a relaxed version of this problem in the setting of\nlocal algorithms. The relaxation is that the constructed subgraph is a sparse\nspanning subgraph containing at most $(1+\\epsilon)n$ edges (where $n$ is the\nnumber of vertices and $\\epsilon$ is a given approximation/sparsity parameter).\nIn the local setting, the goal is to quickly determine whether a given edge $e$\nbelongs to such a subgraph, without constructing the whole subgraph, but rather\nby inspecting (querying) the local neighborhood of $e$. The challenge is to\nmaintain consistency. That is, to provide answers concerning different edges\naccording to the same spanning subgraph. We first show that for general\nbounded-degree graphs, the query complexity of any such algorithm must be\n$\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})$. This lower bound holds for constant-degree graphs that have\nhigh expansion. Next we design an algorithm for (bounded-degree) graphs with\nhigh expansion, obtaining a result that roughly matches the lower bound. We\nthen turn to study graphs that exclude a fixed minor (and are hence\nnon-expanding). We design an algorithm for such graphs, which may have an\nunbounded maximum degree. The query complexity of this algorithm is\n$poly(1/\\epsilon, h)$ (independent of $n$ and the maximum degree), where $h$ is\nthe number of vertices in the excluded minor. Though our two algorithms are\ndesigned for very different types of graphs (and have very different\ncomplexities), on a high-level there are several similarities, and we highlight\nboth the similarities and the differences. \n\n"}

Approximate reference prior Abstract: The objective Bayesian treatment of a model representing two independent\nPoisson processes, labelled as \"signal\" and \"background\" and both contributing\nadditively to the total number of counted events, is considered. It is shown\nthat the reference prior for the parameter of interest (the signal intensity)\ncan be well approximated by the widely (ab)used flat prior only when the\nexpected background is very high. On the other hand, a very simple\napproximation (the limiting form of the reference prior for perfect prior\nbackground knowledge) can be safely used over a large portion of the background\nparameters space. The resulting approximate reference posterior is a Gamma\ndensity whose parameters are related to the observed counts.

Faced with a variety of content choices,\nconsumers are exhibiting diverse preferences for content; their preferences\noften depend on the context in which they consume content as well as various\nexogenous events. To satisfy the consumers' demand for such diverse content,\nmultimedia content aggregators (CAs) have emerged which gather content from\nnumerous multimedia sources. A key challenge for such systems is to accurately\npredict what type of content each of its consumers prefers in a certain\ncontext, and adapt these predictions to the evolving consumers' preferences,\ncontexts and content characteristics. We propose a novel, distributed, online\nmultimedia content aggregation framework, which gathers content generated by\nmultiple heterogeneous producers to fulfill its consumers' demand for content.\nSince both the multimedia content characteristics and the consumers'\npreferences and contexts are unknown, the optimal content aggregation strategy\nis unknown a priori.

In the first chapter,\nsix canonical models of convection are described: three configurations of IH\nconvection driven by constant and uniform volumetric heating, and three\nconfigurations of RB convection driven by the boundary conditions. The IH\nmodels are distinguished by differing pairs of thermal boundary conditions: top\nand bottom boundaries of equal temperature, an insulating bottom with heat flux\nfixed at the top, and an insulating bottom with temperature fixed at the top.\nThe RB models also are distinguished by whether temperatures or heat fluxes are\nfixed at the top and bottom boundaries. Integral quantities important to heat\ntransport are discussed, including the mean fluid temperature, the mean\ntemperature difference between the boundaries, and the mean convective heat\ntransport. Integral relations and bounds are presented, and further bounds are\nconjectured for the IH cases. The second chapter presents results that can be\nderived mathematically from the governing equations: linear and nonlinear\nstability thresholds of static states, and parameter-dependent bounds. Known\nbounds are on mean temperatures in IH convection and on convective transport in\nRB convection. The third chapter reviews numerical simulations and laboratory\nexperiments on IH convection, emphasizing quantitative results. \n\n"}

The current\nQKD implementation with the highest long-distance secret-key rate meets this\nchallenge by transmitting no more than one photon per bit [Opt. Express 21,\n24550-24565 (2013)].

This capacity can be increased if\nvehicles can cross the intersections in platoons rather than one by one as they\ndo today. Platoon formation is enabled by connected vehicle technology. This\npaper assesses the potential mobility benefits of platooning. It argues that\nsaturation flow rates, and hence intersection capacity, can be doubled or\ntripled by platooning. The argument is supported by the analysis of three\nqueuing models and by the simulation of a road network with 16 intersections\nand 73 links. The queuing analysis and the simulations reveal that a signalized\nnetwork with fixed time control will support an increase in demand by a factor\nof (say) two or three if all saturation flows are increased by the same factor,\nwith no change in the control.

We\nperformed a simultaneous spectral analysis of the XMM-Newton and NuSTAR data to\nconfirm that three thermal components and a power law are required to fit the\n0.3-20 keV emission of PSR J0437-4715.

This is done by showing in every Sobolev\nspace, there exists background distributions such that one can construct\narbitrarily small perturbations that exhibit arbitrarily many isolated\nnonlinear oscillations in the density.

Recent work stimulated by the discovery of\n\"zero-determinant\" strategies has rapidly expanded our ability to analyze such\ninteractions. This body of work has primarily focused on games in which players\nface a simple binary choice, to \"cooperate\" or \"defect\". Real individuals,\nhowever, often exhibit behavioral diversity, varying their input to a social\ninteraction both qualitatively and quantitatively. Here we explore how access\nto a greater diversity of behavioral choices impacts the evolution of social\ndynamics in finite populations. We show that, in public goods games, some\ntwo-choice strategies can nonetheless resist invasion by all possible\nmulti-choice invaders, even while engaging in relatively little punishment. We\nalso show that access to greater behavioral choice results in more \"rugged \"\nfitness landscapes, with populations able to stabilize cooperation at multiple\nlevels of investment, such that choice facilitates cooperation when returns on\ninvestments are low, but hinders cooperation when returns on investments are\nhigh. Finally, we analyze iterated rock-paper-scissors games, whose\nnon-transitive payoff structure means unilateral control is difficult and\nzero-determinant strategies do not exist in general. Despite this, we find that\na large portion of multi-choice strategies can invade and resist invasion by\nstrategies that lack behavioral diversity -- so that even well-mixed\npopulations will tend to evolve behavioral diversity. \n\n"}

The classical Minimum\nMean Square Error (MMSE) is a special case of the MMPE. Several bounds,\nproperties and applications of the MMPE are derived and discussed. The optimal\nMMPE estimator is found for Gaussian and binary input distributions. Properties\nof the MMPE as a function of the input distribution, SNR and order $p$ are\nderived. In particular, it is shown that the MMPE is a continuous function of\n$p$ and SNR. These results are possible in view of interpolation and change of\nmeasure bounds on the MMPE. The `Single-Crossing-Point Property' (SCPP) that\nbounds the MMSE for all SNR values {\\it above} a certain value, at which the\nMMSE is known, together with the I-MMSE relationship is a powerful tool in\nderiving converse proofs in information theory. By studying the notion of\nconditional MMPE, a unifying proof (i.e., for any $p$) of the SCPP is shown. A\ncomplementary bound to the SCPP is then shown, which bounds the MMPE for all\nSNR values {\\it below} a certain value, at which the MMPE is known. As a first\napplication of the MMPE, a bound on the conditional differential entropy in\nterms of the MMPE is provided, which then yields a generalization of the\nOzarow-Wyner lower bound on the mutual information achieved by a discrete input\non a Gaussian noise channel. As a second application, the MMPE is shown to\nimprove on previous characterizations of the phase transition phenomenon that\nmanifests, in the limit as the length of the capacity achieving code goes to\ninfinity, as a discontinuity of the MMSE as a function of SNR. As a final\napplication, the MMPE is used to show bounds on the second derivative of mutual\ninformation, that tighten previously known bounds. \n\n"}

The\nself-propelling droplets are initially formed by a water/ethanol mixture in a\nsqualane/monoolein solution, and evolve in up to three stages depending on\nethanol concentration. In the first stage, the droplet propulsion is generated\nby Marangoni flow originating from the solubilization of ethanol in the oily\nphase. During this process the droplets absorb surfactant molecules; in\ncombination with the continuous loss of ethanol this leads to a phase\nseparation of the water/ethanol/monoolein mixture and the formation of Janus\ndroplets, i.e. a water-rich droplet connected to an ethanol-rich droplet that\nis able to deliver cargo. We characterize the different evolution stages of\nself-propulsion by the flow field around the droplet that evolves from a weak\npusher, over a neutral swimmer, to a dimer of neutral swimmers. Finally, we\nutilize this active system to deliver DNA as a cargo. Tuning the delay time\nbefore phase separation, by varying the chemical composition of the droplets,\nseveral different cargo delivery processes can be programmed. \n\n"}

Studies on optimising interstellar and intergalactic\ntrajectories are usually performed in flat spacetime using an analytical\napproach, with very little focus on optimising interstellar trajectories in a\ngeneral relativistic framework. This paper examines the use of low-acceleration\nrockets to reach galactic destinations in the least possible time, with a\ngenetic algorithm being employed for the optimisation process. The fuel\nrequired for each journey was calculated for various types of propulsion\nsystems to determine the viability of low-acceleration rockets to colonise the\nMilky Way. The results showed that to limit the amount of fuel carried on\nboard, an antimatter propulsion system would likely be the minimum\ntechnological requirement to reach star systems tens of thousands of light\nyears away. However, using a low-acceleration rocket would require several\nhundreds of thousands of years to reach these star systems, with minimal time\ndilation effects since maximum velocities only reached about 0.2c. Such transit\ntimes are clearly impractical, and thus, any kind of colonisation using low\nacceleration rockets would be difficult. High accelerations, on the order of\n1g, are likely required to complete interstellar journeys within a reasonable\ntime frame, though they may require prohibitively large amounts of fuel.

We construct an analytic\nframework for modeling the turbulent energy and correlation time as functions\nof SN rate and shear.

Preferential attachment and node fitness are two simple growth\nmechanisms that not only explain certain structural properties commonly\nobserved in real-world systems, but are also tied to a number of applications\nin modeling and inference. While there are statistical packages for estimating\nvarious parametric forms of the preferential attachment function, there is no\nsuch package implementing non-parametric estimation procedures. The\nnon-parametric approach to the estimation of the preferential attachment\nfunction allows for comparatively finer-grained investigations of the\n`rich-get-richer' phenomenon that could lead to novel insights in the search to\nexplain certain nonstandard structural properties observed in real-world\nnetworks. This paper introduces the R package PAFit, which implements\nnon-parametric procedures for estimating the preferential attachment function\nand node fitnesses in a growing network, as well as a number of functions for\ngenerating complex networks from these two mechanisms. The main computational\npart of the package is implemented in C++ with OpenMP to ensure scalability to\nlarge-scale networks.

Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability is an ideal tool for\nanalyzing such safety-critical systems and has been successfully applied to\nseveral small-scale problems. However, a direct application of HJ reachability\nto large scale systems is often intractable because of its\nexponentially-scaling computation complexity with respect to system dimension,\nalso known as the \"curse of dimensionality\". To overcome this problem, the\nsequential path planning (SPP) method, which assigns strict priorities to\nvehicles, was previously proposed; SPP allows multi-vehicle path planning to be\ndone with a linearly-scaling computation complexity. In this work, we\ndemonstrate the potential of SPP algorithm for large-scale systems.

First, the fundamental tradeoff between the repair\nbandwidth and the storage size for functional repair is established. Using a\ngraph-theoretic formulation, the optimal tradeoff is identified as the solution\nto an integer optimization problem, for which a closed-form expression is\nderived. Expressions of the extreme points, namely the minimum storage\nmulti-node repair (MSMR) and minimum bandwidth multi-node repair (MBMR) points,\nare obtained. Second, we describe a general framework for converting single\nerasure minimum storage regenerating codes to MSMR codes. The repair strategy\nfor $e$ failures is similar to that for single failure, however certain extra\nrequirements need to be satisfied by the repairing functions for single\nfailure.

A nontrivial and interesting question concerning this\nsubject is whether there is a sequential scheme for locally discriminating\nbetween two bipartite unitary operations, because a sequential scheme usually\nrepresents the most economic strategy for discrimination. An affirmative answer\nto this question was given in the literature, however with two limitations: (i)\nthe unitary operations to be discriminated were limited to act on $d\\otimes d$,\ni.e., a two-qudit system, and (ii) the inverses of the unitary operations were\nassumed to be accessible, although this assumption may be unrealizable in\nexperiment.

The information\navailable to each agent includes the prevalence of the disease in their local\nnetwork neighborhood and/or globally in the population, as well as the fraction\nof their neighbors that are protected against the disease.

We show that the following anomalies, as found in the Planck\ndata, commonly occur in the toy model maps: (1) large-scale hemispherical\nasymmetry (large-scale dipolar modulation), (2) small-scale hemispherical\nasymmetry (alignment of the spatial distribution of CMB power over all scales\n$\\ell=[2,1500]$) , (3) a strongly non-Gaussian hot or cold spot, (4) a low\npower spectrum amplitude for $\\ell<30$, including specifically (5) a low\nquadrupole and an unusual alignment between the quadrupole and the octopole,\nand (6) parity asymmetry of the lowest multipoles.

I focus on the evolution of the apparent spin frequency, which is\ntypically associated with the motion of a specific point on the stellar surface\n(e.g., polar cap). I start from long-term evolution (on the timescale when\ninstability significantly changes the spin frequency). For this case, I reduce\nevolution equations to one differential equation and demonstrate that it can be\ndirectly derived from energy conservation law. This equation governs evolution\nrate through sequence of thermally equilibrium states and provides linear\ncoupling for the cooling power and rotation energy losses via gravitational\nwave emission. In particular, it shows that differential rotation do not affect\nlong-term spin-down. On the contrary, on the short timescales, differential\nrotation can significantly modify the apparent spin-down, if one examines a\nstrongly unstable star with very small initial amplitude of unstable mode. This\nstatement is confirmed by consideration of Newtonian non-magnetized perfect\nfluid and dissipative stellar models as well as magnetized stellar model.

When the master fails to detect the received signal, retransmission\nis required for each worker which increases the overall run-time to finish the\ntask. We first investigate the expected overall run-time in this setting using\nan (n; k) maximum distance separable (MDS) code. We obtain the lower and upper\nbounds on the latency in closed-forms and give guidelines to design MDS code\ndepending on the packet erasure probability. Finally, we consider a setup where\nthe number of retransmissions is limited due to the bandwidth constraint. By\nformulating practical optimization problems related to latency, transmission\nbandwidth and probability of successful computation, we obtain achievable\nperformance curves as a function of packet erasure probability. \n\n"}

He also pointed out that small\nnonaxisymmetric temperature variations in the accreted crust will lead to\n\"wavy\" electron capture layers, whose horizontal density variations naturally\ncreate a mass quadrupole moment.\n  We present a full calculation of the crust's elastic adjustment to these\ndensity perturbations and find that the elastic response of the crust reduces\nBildsten's original estimate of the quadrupole moment in the thin outer crust\nby a factor of 20-50. However, this basic picture, when applied to capture\nlayers in the deep inner crust, can generate quadrupoles in the necessary range\nas long as there are ~5% lateral temperature variations in the inner crust.

Instead, the dynamo\nprocess is dominated by a new quantity, derived from asymmetries in the second\nderivative of the velocity correlation function, closely related to the `twist\nand fold' dynamo model. The turbulent damping term is, as expected, almost\nunchanged. Numerical simulations with a spatially constant fluid helicity and\nvanishing resistivity are not expected to generate large scale fields in\nequipartition with the turbulent energy density. The prospects for driving a\nfast dynamo under these circumstances are uncertain, but if it is possible,\nthen the field must be largely force-free. On the other hand, there is an\nefficient analog to the $\\alpha-\\Omega$ dynamo. Systems whose turbulence is\ndriven by some anisotropic local instability in a shearing flow, like real\nstars and accretion disks, and some computer simulations, may successfully\ndrive the generation of strong large scale magnetic fields, provided that\n$\\partial_r\\Omega< \\partial_\\theta v_z\\omega_\\theta>>0$.

This could be the correct paradigm for many SNe Ia and Ic, where\nIa's are both thermonuclear and core-collapsed objects, which leave\nweakly-magnetized, rapidly spinning (~2 ms) pulsars. In this paradigm Ia/c is\nproduced from the merger of two degenerate cores of common envelope WR stars,\nor of two CO white dwarfs. Its polar blowouts produce the observed high\nvelocity and polarized spectral features in Ia's, and its equatorial bulge is\nmuch brighter in Ia's, due to the greater fraction of 56Ni contained within it.\nThese become classified as Ia's when viewed from the merger equator, and Ic's\nwhen viewed from the poles, where a hypernova signature and a gamma-ray burst\n(GRB) will be observed for lines of sight close to the merger axis.

Independent of environment, S0 galaxies are found\nto lie systematically below the TFR for nearby spirals in both optical and\ninfrared bands.

We show that most\nof this scatter is intrinsic, not due to the observational uncertainties. The\npresence of such a large scatter means that the population of S0 galaxies\ncannot have formed exclusively by the above simple fading mechanism after all\ntransforming at a single epoch.

As a function of $p$ we find a phase transition between\ndifferent kind of absorbing states. The phases differ by the existence of an\ninfinitely connected (percolated) cluster of negative links that forms whenever\n$p\\leq p_c$. Moreover, for $p\\leq p_c$, the time to reach the absorbing state\ngrows powerlike with the system size $L$, while it increases logarithmically\nwith $L$ for $p > p_c$.

Within the transport model IBUU04, the in-medium NN cross sections\nare found to influence significantly the isospin transport in heavy-ion\nreactions. With the in-medium NN cross sections, a symmetry energy of\n$E_{sym}(\\rho)\\approx 31.6(\\rho /\\rho_{0})^{0.69}$ was found most acceptable\ncompared with both the MSU isospin diffusion data and the presently acceptable\nneutron-skin thickness in $^{208}$Pb.

To this end the general geometrical model for\nseveral kinds of matter with different Lorentziann structures coexisting on the\nsame manifold is introduced and the local energy density in cosmological\nreference frame is calculated in two particular cases. It is shown that the\nlocal energy density is positive in both considered cases and hence such models\nreally may describe cosmological dark matter.

{"id": "quant-ph/0005010", "contents": "Title: Contextuality of Approximate Measurements Abstract: The claim of Meyer, Kent and Clifton (MKC) that finite precision measurement\nnullifies the Kochen-Specker theorem is criticised. It is argued that, although\nMKC have nullified the Kochen-Specker theorem strictly so-called, there are\nother, related propositions which are not nullified. The argument given is an\nelaboration of some of Mermin's critical remarks. Although MKC allow for the\nfact that the observables to be measured cannot be precisely specified, they\ncontinue to assume that the observables which are actually measured are\nstrictly commuting. As Mermin points out, this assumption is unjustified.\nConsequently, the analysis of MKC is incomplete. To make it complete one needs\nto investigate the predictions their models make regarding approximate joint\nmeasurements of non-commuting observables. Such an investigation is carried\nout, using methods previously developed in connection with approximate joint\nmeasurements of position and momentum. It is shown that a form of contextuality\nthen re-emerges. \n\n"}
