In fields large enough to suppress superconductivity,\nR_H(T) is seen to go from positive at high temperature to negative at low\ntemperature, for p > 0.08.

{"id": "1104.4404", "contents": "Title: Can nothing be a superconductor and a superfluid? Abstract: A superconductor is a material that conducts electric current with no\nresistance. Superconductivity and magnetism are known to be antagonistic\nphenomena: superconductors expel weak external magnetic field (the Meissner\neffect) while a sufficiently strong magnetic field, in general, destroys\nsuperconductivity. In a seemingly contradictory statement, we show that a very\nstrong magnetic field can turn an empty space into a superconductor. The\nexternal magnetic field required for this effect should be about 10^{16} Tesla\n(eB ~ 1 GeV^2). The physical mechanism of the exotic vacuum superconductivity\nis as follows: in strong magnetic field the dynamics of virtual quarks and\nantiquarks is effectively one-dimensional because these electrically charged\nparticles tend to move along the lines of the magnetic field. In one spatial\ndimension a gluon-mediated attraction between a quark and an antiquark of\ndifferent flavors inevitably leads to formation of a colorless spin-triplet\nbound state (a vector analogue of the Cooper pair) with quantum numbers of an\nelectrically charged rho meson. Such quark-antiquark pairs condense to form an\nanisotropic inhomogeneous superconducting state similar to the Abrikosov vortex\nlattice in a type-II superconductor. The onset of the superconductivity of the\ncharged rho mesons should also induce an inhomogeneous superfluidity of the\nneutral rho mesons. The vacuum superconductivity should survive at very high\ntemperatures of typical Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) scale of 10^{12} K (T ~\n100 MeV).

Consequently, by supplementing the Hamiltonian of\nthe SU(N) model with a perturbation Hamiltonian that removes the GS degeneracy,\nthe LT is to apply also for the SU(N) model in the limit of the coupling\nconstant, \\lambda, of this perturbation approaching zero, where the limit\n\\lambda --> 0 is clearly to be taken subsequent to taking the zero-temperature\nlimit of the thermal single-particle Green function in the expression for the\nLuttinger number N_L. We explicitly establish the validity of this statement\nfor the case of N=4. The details of the relevant calculations being distinctly\ntransparent, one can readily convince oneself that our observation is valid for\narbitrary N. It follows that the issues raised by DPK, such as non-existence of\nthe Luttinger-Ward functional and \"breakdown of the elemental particle picture\nin strongly correlated electron matter\", are all inessential to the observed\nfailure of the LT. As regards the singularity of the self-energy \\Sigma(\\omega)\non the real \\omega-axis, observed by DPK, we demonstrate that this also is a\ndirect consequence of the non-uniqueness of the GS of the SU(N) model for 0 < n\n< N.

As a consequence, the unparticle picture proposed by\nGeorgi\\cite{georgi} is the natural candidate to describe such dynamics.\nUnparticle stuff is scale-invariant matter with no particular mass. Scale\ninvariance dictates that the propagator has an algebraic form which can admit\nzeros and hence is a candidate to explain the ubiquitous pseudogap state of the\ncuprates. The non-perturbative electronic state formed out of unparticles we\nrefer to as an un-Fermi liquid. We show that the underlying action of the\ncontinuous mass formulation of unparticles can be recast exactly as an action\nin anti de Sitter space. We find that this mapping fixes the scaling dimension\nof the unparticle to be $d_U=d/2+\\sqrt{d^2+4}/2$ and ensures that the\ncorresponding propagator has zeros with $d$ the spacetime dimension of the\nunparticle field. Should $d=2+1$, unparticles acquire the non-trivial phase\n$2\\pi d_U$ upon interchange. Because $d_U$ is non-integer and in general not\nhalf-integer, clockwise and counterclockwise interchange of unparticles do not\nlead to the same phase and time reversal symmetry is broken spontaneously as\nreported in numerous experiments in the pseudogap phase of the cuprates. The\npossible relevance of this mechanism to such experiments is discussed. We then\nformulate the analogous BCS gap using unparticles and find that in contrast to\nthe Fermi liquid case, the transition temperature increases as the attractive\ninteraction strength decreases, indicating that unparticles are highly\nsusceptible to a superconducting instability. \n\n"}

We here propose a simple mechanism which\nachieves this goal for abelian and non-abelian fractional quantum Hall states\nof light. Our construction uses a uniform two-photon drive field to couple the\nqubits of the primary lattice with an auxiliary ``shadow\" lattice, composed of\nqubits with a much faster loss rate than the qubits of the primary quantum\nsimulator itself. This coupling causes hole states created by photon losses to\nbe rapidly refilled, and the system's many-body gap prevents further photons\nfrom being added once the strongly correlated ground state is reached.

Evidence of CDW formation is found for\n0.45<x<0.93, but not for samples with x<0.44 that exhibit incommensurate\nspin-density-wave order, and in slightly overdoped samples with x=0.99. This\nsuggests the presence of two proximate zero-temperature CDW critical points at\ndoping pc1~0.08 and pc2~0.18. The CDW reflections are observed at\nincommensurate in-plane wave vectors (d_a, 0) and (0, d_b). Both decrease\nlinearly with increasing doping, in agreement with recent reports on Bi-based\nhigh-Tc superconductors, but in sharp contrast to the behavior of the 214\nfamily. The CDW intensity and correlation length exhibit maxima at p~0.12,\ncoincident with a plateau in the superconducting transition temperature Tc. The\nonset temperature of the CDW reflections depends non-monotonically on p, with a\nmaximum of~160 K for p~0.12. The RXS reflections exhibit a uniaxial intensity\nanisotropy. We further observe a depression of CDW correlations upon cooling\nbelow Tc, and (for samples with p> 0.09) an enhancement of the signal when an\nexternal magnetic field up to 6 T is applied in the superconducting state. For\nsamples with p~0.08, where prior work has revealed a field-enhancement of\nincommensurate magnetic order, the RXS signal is field-independent. This\nsupports a previously suggested scenario in which incommensurate charge and\nspin orders compete against each other, in addition to individually competing\nagainst.

These two effects have different physical origins, yet they can lead to\nsimilar gap features in the electronic spectrum. Here we show how to\ndisentangle them experimentally in the iron superconductors with one Fe plane\nper unit cell. Although the splitting of the low energy doublet at the\nBrillouin zone center ($\\Gamma$-point) can be due to either the spin-orbit\ncoupling or the nematic order, or both, the degeneracy of each of the doublet\nstates at the zone corner ($M$-point) is protected by the space group symmetry\neven when spin-orbit coupling is taken into account. Therefore, any splitting\nat $M$ must be due to lowering of the crystal symmetry, such as due to the\nnematic order.

However, since the discovery of the high temperature\nsuperconductors (HTSC) in 1986, the central role attributed to the pseudogap in\nthese systems has meant that by many researchers now associate the term\npseudogap exclusively with the HTSC phenomenon. Recently, the problem has got a\nlot of new attention with the rediscovery of two distinct energy scales\n(`two-gap scenario') and charge density waves patterns in the cuprates. Despite\nmany excellent reviews on the pseudogap phenomenon in HTSC, published from its\nvery discovery up to now, the mechanism of the pseudogap and its relation to\nsuperconductivity are still open questions. The present review represents a\ncontribution dealing with the pseudogap, focusing on results from angle\nresolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and ends up with the conclusion\nthat the pseudogap in cuprates is a complex phenomenon which includes at least\nthree different `intertwined' orders: spin and charge density waves and\npreformed pairs, which appears in different parts of the phase diagram.

We also find that pressure and magnetic field\nshift the superconducting transition temperature $T_{\\rm c}$ of YBCO in the\nsame way as a function of doping - but in opposite directions - and most\neffectively at $p \\simeq 0.12$.

Recent experimental studies on a hole-doped version of BEDT\ncompounds reveal an enhancement of superconductivity and a rapid crossover\nbetween two different conducting phases above the superconducting dome. One of\nthese phases is a Fermi liquid, the other not. Using plaquette cellular\ndynamical mean field theory with state of the art continuous-time quantum Monte\nCarlo calculations, we study this problem with the two-dimensional Hubbard\nmodel on the anisotropic triangular lattice.

ZrTe5\nhas host a long-standing puzzle on its anomalous transport properties; its\nunderlying origin remains elusive. Lately, ZrTe5 has ignited renewed interest\nbecause it is predicted that single-layer ZrTe5 is a two-dimensional\ntopological insulator and there is possibly a topological phase transition in\nbulk ZrTe5.

Here we report high-resolution laser-based angle-resolved\nphotoemission measurements on ZrTe5. The electronic property of ZrTe5 is\ndominated by two branches of nearly-linear-dispersion bands at the Brillouin\nzone center. These two bands are separated by an energy gap that decreases with\ndecreasing temperature but persists down to the lowest temperature we measured\n(~2 K).

The derivation of the response\nfunctions is based on the elegant functional path integral approach which\nallows us to calculate the density-density and spin-spin correlation functions\nby introducing the external sources for the density and the spin density. Since\nthe generating functional cannot be evaluated exactly, we consider two gapless\napproximations which ensure a gapless collective mode (Goldstone mode) in the\nsuperfluid state: the BCS-Leggett mean-field theory and the\nGaussian-pair-fluctuation (GPF) theory. In the mean-field theory, our results\nof the response functions agree with the known results from the random phase\napproximation.

In particular, the pseudogap\nvanishes in a finite region around the anti-nodal point, in which a single\nbroadened peak emerges at the un-renormalized quasiparticle energy. Such an\nobservation is argued to be inconsistent with the antiferromagnetic(AFM)\nband-folding picture, which predicts a constant pseudogap along the AFBZ\nboundary. On the other hand, it is claimed that the experimental results are\nconsistent with the prediction of the cluster dynamical mean field\ntheory(CDMFT) simulation on the Hubbard model, in which the pseudogap is\ninterpreted as a s-wave splitting between the Hubbard bands and the in-gap\nstates. Here we show that the observed momentum dependence of the pseudogap is\nindeed consistent with AFM band-folding picture, provided that we assume the\nexistence of a strongly momentum dependent quasiparticle scattering rate. More\nspecifically, we show that the quasiparticle scattering rate acts to reduce the\nspectral gap induced by AFM band-folding effect.

The metallic behavior of\nresistance is explained as result of activation of localized electrons to\nconductance band leading to a suppression of non-linear screening of the\ndisorder potential. The magnetoresistance (MR) in the critical region is\nrelated to depopulation of double occupied localized states also leading to\npartial suppression of the nonlinear screening.

The\ncuprates seems to exhibit statistics, dimensionality and phase transitions in\nnovel ways. The nature of excitations [i.e. quasiparticle or collective] must\nbe understood. The Hubbard model captures some of the behaviour of the phase\ntransitions in these materials. On the other hand the phases such as stripes in\nthese materials bear relationship to quantum group or string-like solutions.\nOne thus expects that the relevant solutions of Hubbard model may thus be\nwritten in terms of stringy solutions. In short this approach may lead to the\nnon-perturbative formualtion of Hubbard and other condensed matter\nHamiltonians. The question arises that how a 1-d based symmetry such as quantum\ngroups can be relevant in describing a 3-d [spatial dimensions] system such as\ncuprates.

Two-Component Nonstoichiometric Compounds and the\n  Insulator--Superconductor--Metal Transition Abstract: One of the reasons for the lack of understanding of both the mechanisms\nunderlying the HTSC phenomenon and of the instability of materials with Tc >\n300 K may be the widely accepted but wrong ideas about the types of chemical\nbonding in a substance and the radii of the atoms and ions. A revision of these\nconcepts started in the beginning of the XX century in connection with the\ninvestigation of non-stoichiometric compounds (the berthollides) but did not\nreach a critical level until recently. Most of the HTSC materials, however, are\nactually non-stoichiometric nanocomposites, whose components \"dilute\" or\n\"stretch\" one another. Each component resides in an \"intermediate\" state, which\nstill remains poorly studied. For instance, in a system of particles having two\npaired electrons each, the unbroken electron pairs may start tunneling at a\ncertain \"medium\" concentration with the system becoming a Bose superconductor\n(the state between the insulator and the metal with BCS superconductivity). For\nunivalent atoms (Na,Ag), however, such possibility realizes neither in\nintermediate nor in the final state. Univalent metals are not superconductors.\nIn the berthollides, however, a possible Jahn-Teller-Peierls-type instability\nmay give rise to formation of diatomic molecules (Na2, Ag2)with electron pairs,\nand superconductivity can set in. It is possibly such systems that were\nobtained by chance in experiments with univalent components and reported to\nhave Tc of up to 371 K.

In contrast to the quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method\nwhich at low temperatures includes only Ising-like exchange interactions to\navoid sign problems, ED permits a treatment of Hund's exchange and other onsite\nCoulomb interactions on the same footing. The role of finite-size effects\ncaused by the limited number of bath levels in this scheme is studied by\nanalyzing the low-frequency behavior of the subband self-energies as a function\nof temperature, and by comparing with numerical renormalization group (NRG)\nresults for an effective one-band model. For half-filled, non-hybridizing\nbands, the metallic and insulating phases are separated by an intermediate\nmixed phase with an insulating narrow and a bad-metallic wide subband.

A giant drop in the number of current carriers during the\ntransition, which is a consequence of local bound pair (bipolaron) formation in\nthe paramagnetic phase, is extremely sensitive to an external magnetic field.\nBelow the critical temperature of the transition, $T_c$, the binding of the\npolarons into immobile pairs competes with the ferromagnetic exchange between\npolarons and the localized spins on Mn ions, which tends to align the polaron\nmoments and, therefore, breaks up those pairs. The number of carriers abruptly\nincreases below $T_c$ leading to a sudden drop in resistivity. We show that the\ncarrier density collapse describes the colossal magnetoresistance of doped\nmanganites close to the transition.\n  Below $T_c$, transport occurs by polaronic tunneling, whereas at high\ntemperatures the transport is by hopping processes.

It can be shown that $\\eta$ is determined by the\nratio of the phase coherence lengths $\\ell_i$ in the respective directions:\n$\\sigma_{ab}/\\sigma_c = \\ell_{ab}^2/\\ell_{c}^2$. In layered crystals in which\nthe out-of-plane transport is incoherent, $\\ell_{c}$ is fixed, equal to the\ninterlayer spacing. As a result, the T-dependence of $\\eta$ is determined by\nthat of $\\ell_{ab}$, and vice versa, the in-plane phase coherence length can be\nobtained directly by measuring the resistive anisotropy.

Recently, such states were shown to be a\nconvenient point of departure for studying translational symmetry breaking in\ndoped antiferromagnets: these results are briefly reviewed here with an\nemphasis on experimental implications.

This transition is\ndescribed by a fully-frustrated Ising model in a transverse field: details of\nthis earlier derivation of the Ising model are provided here--this is motivated\nby the reappearance of the same Ising model in a recent study of the\ncompetition between antiferromagnetism and d-wave superconductivity by Senthil\nand Fisher (cond-mat/9910224). \n\n"}

{"id": "hep-ph/0408322", "contents": "Title: Heating (Gapless) Color-Flavor Locked Quark Matter Abstract: We explore the phase diagram of neutral quark matter at high baryon density\nas a function of the temperature T and the strange quark mass Ms. At T=0, there\nis a sharp distinction between the insulating color-flavor locked (CFL) phase,\nwhich occurs where Ms^2/mu < 2 Delta, and the metallic gapless CFL phase, which\noccurs at larger Ms^2/mu. Here, mu is the chemical potential for quark number\nand Delta is the gap in the CFL phase. We find this distinction blurred at\nnonzero T, as the CFL phase undergoes an insulator-to-metal crossover when it\nis heated. We present an analytic treatment of this crossover. At higher\ntemperatures, we map out the phase transition lines at which the gap parameters\nDelta_1, Delta_2 and Delta_3 describing ds-pairing, us-pairing and ud-pairing\nrespectively, go to zero in an NJL model. For small values of Ms^2/mu, we find\nthat Delta_2 vanishes first, then Delta_1, then Delta_3. We find agreement with\na previous Ginzburg-Landau analysis of the form of these transitions and find\nquantitative agreement with results obtained in full QCD at asymptotic density\nfor ratios of coefficients in the Ginzburg-Landau potential. At larger Ms^2/mu,\nwe find that Delta_1 vanishes first, then Delta_2, then Delta_3. Hence, we find\na \"doubly critical'' point in the (Ms^2/mu,T)-plane at which two lines of\nsecond order phase transitions (Delta_1->0 and Delta_2->0) cross. Because we do\nnot make any small-Ms approximation, if we choose a relatively strong coupling\nleading to large gap parameters, we are able to pursue the analysis of the\nphase diagram all the way up to such large values of Ms that there are no\nstrange quarks present. \n\n"}
