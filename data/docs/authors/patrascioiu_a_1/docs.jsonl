The derivation and analysis of Dyson-Schwinger equations increase\nconsiderably in complexity when going beyond the standard Landau gauge fixing\nand the available tools have to be improved. For the derivation of the\nequations a computer program (DoDSE) was developed in order to handle the\nplethora of terms. The process of determining possible infrared solutions is\nabstracted to obtain further insight into the structure of the so-called\ninfrared scaling solutions. It is found that a few simple steps suffice to\ndetermine possible infrared scaling relations directly from the action. For the\nmaximally Abelian gauge an infrared enhanced diagonal gluon propagator is\nfound, while the off-diagonal degrees of freedom are infrared suppressed. This\nis in agreement with the idea of Abelian infrared dominance. Furthermore, it is\nproven that SU(2) and higher SU(N) have the same infrared behavior, although\nthe corresponding actions differ.

These\nspectral distortions depend on the shape and amplitude of the primordial power\nspectrum at wavenumbers k < 10^4 Mpc^{-1}. Here we study constraints on the\nprimordial power spectrum derived from COBE/FIRAS and forecasted for PIXIE. We\nshow that measurements of mu and y impose strong bounds on the integrated\nsmall-scale power, and we demonstrate how to compute these constraints using\nk-space window functions that account for the effects of thermalization and\ndissipation physics. We show that COBE/FIRAS places a robust upper limit on the\namplitude of the small-scale power spectrum. This limit is about three orders\nof magnitude stronger than the one derived from primordial black holes in the\nsame scale range. Furthermore, this limit could be improved by another three\norders of magnitude with PIXIE, potentially opening up a new window to early\nUniverse physics. To illustrate the power of these constraints, we consider\nseveral generic models for the small-scale power spectrum predicted by\ndifferent inflation scenarios, including running-mass inflation models and\ninflation scenarios with episodes of particle production.

Inside the proton a nonzero density of the\ntensor-gluons can be generated by the emission of tensor-gluons by gluons. The\nlast mechanism is typical for non-Abelian tensor gauge theories, in which there\nexists a gluon-tensor-tensor vertex of order g. Therefore the number of gluons\nchanges not only because a quark may radiate a gluon or because a gluon may\nsplit into a quark-antiquark pair or into two gluons, but also because a gluon\ncan split into two tensor-gluons.

For stronger two-body\ninteraction, the relativistic three-body system still collapses.\n  A similar phenomenon was found in a two-body systems themselves: a\ntwo-fermion system with one-boson exchange interaction in a state with zero\nangular momentum J=0 exists if the coupling constant does not exceed some\ncritical value but it also collapses for larger coupling constant. For a J=1\nstate, it collapses for any coupling constant value. These properties are\ncalled \"critical stability\". This contribution aims to be a brief review of\nthis field pioneered by H.P.

A detailed numerical analysis\nreveals that the form factor associated with this latter tensor displays a\nchange of sign (zero-crossing) in the deep infrared, and finally diverges\nlogarithmically. The origin of this characteristic behavior is proven to be\nentirely due to the masslessness of the ghost propagators forming the\ncorresponding ghost-loop diagram, in close analogy to a similar effect\nestablished for the three-gluon vertex. However, in the case at hand, and under\nthe approximations employed, this particular divergence does not affect the\nform factor proportional to the tree-level tensor, which remains finite in the\nentire range of momenta, and deviates moderately from its naive tree-level\nvalue. It turns out that the kinematic configuration chosen is ideal for\ncarrying out lattice simulations, because it eliminates from the connected\nGreen's function all one-particle reducible contributions, projecting out the\ngenuine one-particle irreducible vertex. Motivated by this possibility, we\ndiscuss in detail how a hypothetical lattice measurement of this quantity would\ncompare to the results presented here, and the potential interference from an\nadditional tensorial structure, allowed by Bose symmetry, but not encountered\nwithin our scheme. \n\n"}

We show that these are best fitted by a\nmodel of a single string with a quark at one endpoint and a diquark at the\nother. This model is preferred over the Y-shaped string model with a quark at\neach endpoint. We show how the model follows from a stringy model of the\nholographic baryon which includes a baryonic vertex connected with N_c strings\nto flavor probe branes. From fitting to baryonic data we find that there is no\nclear evidence for a non-zero baryonic vertex mass, but if there is such a mass\nit should be located at one of the string endpoints. The available baryon\ntrajectories in the angular momentum plane (J,M^2), involving light, strange,\nand charmed baryons, are rather well fitted when adding masses to the string\nendpoints, with a single universal slope of 0.95 GeV^-2.

This causes a\nlarge bulge in the propagator at small momentum. Mass is defined through\n$m^{-2}=\\Delta (p=0)$, where $\\Delta(p)$ is the scalar function for the gluon\npropagator in some chosen gauge, it is not a pole mass and is generally\ngauge-dependent, except in the gauge-invariant Pinch Technique (PT). We\ntruncate the PT equations with a new method called the vertex paradigm that\nautomatically satisfies the QED-like Ward identity relating the 3-gluon PT\nvertex function with the PT propagator. The mass is determined by a homogeneous\nBethe-Salpeter equation involving this vertex and propagator. This gap equation\nalso encapsulates the Bethe-Salpeter equation for the massless scalar\nexcitations, essentially Nambu-Goldstone fields, that necessarily accompany\ngauge-invariant gluon mass. The problem is to find a good approximate value for\n$m$ and at the same time explain the bulge, which by itself leads, in the gap\nequation for the gluon mass, to excessively large values for the mass.

While the transfer matrix formalism is a type of\nHeisenberg picture for this problem, we develop here the associated\nSchr\\\"odinger picture that keeps track of the local probabilistic information.\nThe transport of the probabilistic information between neighboring\nhypersurfaces obeys a linear evolution equation, and therefore the\nsuperposition principle for the possible solutions. Operators are associated to\nlocal observables, with rules for the computation of expectation values similar\nto quantum mechanics. We discuss how non-commutativity naturally arises in this\nsetting. Also other features characteristic of quantum mechanics, such as\ncomplex structure, change of basis or symmetry transformations, can be found in\nclassical statistics once formulated in terms of wave functions or density\nmatrices. We construct for every quantum system an equivalent classical\nstatistical system, such that time in quantum mechanics corresponds to the\nlocation of hypersurfaces in the classical probabilistic ensemble.

Most of these effects are closely related to the\nphenomenon of spontaneous breaking of the chiral flavor symmetry and the\nemergence of pions as light Goldstone bosons. These long-range fluctuations are\nstrongly affected by putting the system into a finite box, and an analysis with\ndifferent methods can be organized according to the interplay between pion mass\nand box size. The finite volume also affects critical behavior at the chiral\nphase transition in QCD. In the present review, I will be mainly concerned with\nmodeling such finite volume effects as they affect the thermodynamics of the\nchiral phase transition for two quark flavors.\n  I review recent work on the analysis of finite-volume effects which makes use\nof the quark-meson model for dynamical chiral symmetry breaking.

By performing a five-loop $\\epsilon$-expansion computation we\ndetermine the fixed points and their stability. It turns out that for\nN=n_1+n_2\\ge 3 the O(N)-symmetric fixed point is unstable. For N=3, the\nmulticritical behavior is described by the biconal fixed point with critical\nexponents that are very close to the Heisenberg ones. For N\\ge 4 and any\nn_1,n_2 the critical behavior is controlled by the tetracritical decoupled\nfixed point. We discuss the relevance of these results for some physically\ninteresting systems, in particular for anisotropic antiferromagnets in the\npresence of a magnetic field and for high-T_c superconductors. Concerning the\nSO(5) theory of superconductivity, we show that the bicritical O(5) fixed point\nis unstable with a significant crossover exponent, $\\phi_{4,4}\\approx 0.15$;\nthis implies that the O(5) symmetry is not effectively realized at the point\nwhere the antiferromagnetic and superconducting transition lines meet.

We first derive a tree-level improved clover quark action on the\nanisotropic lattice for arbitrary quark mass. The heavy quark mass dependences\nof the improvement coefficients, i.e. the ratio of the hopping parameters\n$\\zeta=K_t/K_s$ and the clover coefficients $c_{s,t}$, are examined at the tree\nlevel. We then compute the charmonium spectrum in the quenched approximation\nemploying $\\xi = a_s/a_t = 3$ anisotropic lattices. Simulations are made with\nthe standard anisotropic gauge action and the anisotropic clover quark action\nat four lattice spacings in the range $a_s$=0.07-0.2 fm. The clover\ncoefficients $c_{s,t}$ are estimated from tree-level tadpole improvement. On\nthe other hand, for the ratio of the hopping parameters $\\zeta$, we adopt both\nthe tree-level tadpole-improved value and a non-perturbative one. We calculate\nthe spectrum of S- and P-states and their excitations. The results largely\ndepend on the scale input even in the continuum limit, showing a quenching\neffect.

(II) Overall\nconstant coefficient of the fermion generating functional. (III) Fermion\npropagator appearing in external fermion lines and the propagator connected to\nYukawa vertices. The first effect appears from the transformation of the path\nintegral measure and it is absorbed into a suitable definition of the constant\nphase factor for each topological sector; in this sense there appears no ``CP\nanomaly''. The second constant arises from the explicit breaking in the action\nand it is absorbed by the suitable weights with which topological sectors are\nsummed. The last one in the propagator is inherent to this formulation and\ncannot be avoided by a mere modification of the projection operator, for\nexample, in the framework of the Ginsparg-Wilson operator. This breaking\nemerges as an (almost) contact term in the propagator when the Higgs field,\nwhich is treated perturbatively, has no vacuum expectation value. In the\npresence of the vacuum expectation value, however, a completely new situation\narises and the breaking becomes intrinsically non-local, though this breaking\nmay still be removed in a suitable continuum limit.

In partially\nquenched QCD, when the sea and valence light quark masses are not equal, the\nlack of unitarity leads to the same inconsistencies as in quenched QCD and the\nmatrix elements cannot be determined.

In order that this vacuum be\nsupersymmetric, it is well known that all field expectation values must be\nalong so-called flat directions, leaving the F- and D-terms of the scalar\npotential to be zero. The situation becomes particularly interesting when one\nattempts to realize such directions while assigning VEVS to fields transforming\nunder non-Abelian representations of the gauge group. Since the expectation\nvalue is now shared among multiple components of a field, satisfaction of\nflatness becomes an inherently geometrical problem in the group space.\nFurthermore, the possibility emerges that a single seemingly dangerous F-term\nmight experience a self-cancellation among its components.

The approach is a BRST formulation based on the\nunderlying Sp(2,R)gauge symmetry, and shares some similarities with the\napproach used to construct string field theory. In our first case of spinless\nparticles, the interaction is uniquely determined by the BRST gauge symmetry,\nand it is different than the Chern-Simons type theory used in open string field\ntheory. After constructing a BRST gauge invariant action for 2T-physics field\ntheory with interactions in d+2 dimensions, we study its relation to standard\n1T-physics field theory in (d-1)+1 dimensions by choosing gauges. In one gauge\nwe show that we obtain the Klein-Gordon field theory in (d-1)+1 dimensions with\nunique SO(d,2) conformal invariant self interactions at the classical field\nlevel.

The first system is solved with a\ndeflated GMRES method that generates eigenvector information at the same time\nthat the linear equations are solved. Subsequent systems are solved by\ncombining an iterative method with a projection over the previously determined\neigenvectors. Restarted GMRES is considered for the iterative method as well as\nnon-restarted methods such as BiCGSTAB. These methods offer an alternative to\nblock methods, and they can also be combined with a block approach. An example\nis given showing significant improvement for a problem from quantum\nchromodynamics. \n\n"}
