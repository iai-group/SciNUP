This\nquickly establishes a high quality entanglement between the spins at the\nopposite ends of the chain. This entanglement is mediated by the Kondo Cloud,\nattains a constant high value independent of the length for large chains, and\nshows thermal robustness. In contrast, when the Kondo cloud is absent, e.g. in\nthe gapped dimer regime, only finite size end to end effects can create some\nentanglement on a much longer time-scale for rather short chains. By decoupling\none end of the chain during the dynamics one can distinguish between this\nend-end effect which vanishes, and the global Kondo cloud mediated\nentanglement, which persists.

The dopant\ngenerates a vortex-like quantum distortion of the AF background centered on the\nempty sites, with opposite chirality for cores on the two N\\'eel sublattices.\nEmpty sites are described in terms of spinless fermionic holons and the\nlong-range attraction between spin vortices on two opposite N\\'eel sublattices\nis the holon pairing force, leading eventually to SC. The spin fluctuations are\ndescribed by bosonic spinons with a gap generated by scattering on spin\nvortices. Due to the occupation constraint, there is a gauge attraction between\nholon and spinon, binding them into a physical hole. Through gauge interaction\nthe spin vortex attraction induces the formation of spin-singlet RVB pairs\nreducing the spinon gap. Lowering T, there are two crossovers as precursors of\nthe SC transition: at the higher one a gas of holon pairs appears, reducing the\nhole spectral weight, while at the lower one a gas of spinon pairs also\nappears, giving rise to a gas of incoherent preformed hole pairs with magnetic\nvortices in the plasma phase, supporting a Nernst signal.

Despite this long history the\nunambiguous observation of Majorana fermions nevertheless remains an\noutstanding goal. This review article highlights recent advances in the\ncondensed matter search for Majorana that have led many in the field to believe\nthat this quest may soon bear fruit. We begin by introducing in some detail\nexotic `topological' one- and two-dimensional superconductors that support\nMajorana fermions at their boundaries and at vortices.

Numerous\nproposals of this type are discussed, based on diverse materials such as\ntopological insulators, conventional semiconductors, ferromagnetic metals, and\nmany others.

The local moments carried by Mn impurities doped into\nBa(Fe1-xCox)2As2(Co-122) and BaFe(As1-xPx)2(P-122) at optimal doping induce a\nspin polarization in the vicinity of the impurity. The amplitude, shape and\nextension of this polarisation is given by the real part of the susceptibility\nchi'(r) of FeAs layers, and is consequently related to the nature and strength\nof the electronic correlations present in the system. We study this\npolarisation using 75As NMR in Co-122 and both 75As and 31P NMR in P-122. The\nNMR spectra of Mn-doped materials is made of two essential features. First is a\nsatellite line associated with nuclei located as nearest neighbor of Mn\nimpurities. The analysis of the temperature dependence of the shift of this\nsatellite line shows that Mn local moments behave as isolated Curie moments.\nThe second feature is a temperature dependent broadening of the central line.\nWe show that the broadening of the central line follows the susceptibility of\nMn local moments, as expected from typical RKKY-like interactions. This\ndemonstrates that the susceptibility chi'(r) of FeAs layers does not make\nsignificant contribution to the temperature dependent broadening of the central\nline. chi'(r) is consequently only weakly temperature dependent in optimally\ndoped Co-122 and P-122. This behaviour is in contrast with that of strongly\ncorrelated materials such as underdoped cuprate high-Tc superconductors where\nthe central line broadens faster than the impurity susceptibility grows,\nbecause of the development of strong magnetic correlations when T is lowered.\nMoreover, the FeAs layer susceptibility is found quantitatively similar in both\nheterovalent doped and isolvalent doped BaFe2As2. \n\n"}

Combined with previous data around the so-called 1/8 doping, we\nshow that bulk CDW order exists at least for hole concentrations (p) in the\nCuO2 planes of 0.078 <~ p <~ 0.132. This implies that CDW order exists in close\nvicinity to the quantum critical point for spin density wave (SDW) order. In\ncontrast to the pseudogap temperature T*, the onset temperature of CDW order\ndecreases with underdoping to T_CDW ~ 90K in YBa2Cu3O6.44. Together with a\nweakened order parameter this suggests a competition between CDW and SDW\norders. In addition, the CDW order in YBa2Cu3O6.44 shows the same type of\ncompetition with superconductivity as a function of temperature and magnetic\nfield as samples closer to p = 1/8. At low p the CDW incommensurability\ncontinues the previously reported linear increasing trend with underdoping.

Using\nquasiclassical Green's function method, we show that the magnetization becomes\nfinite inside N. The origin of this magnetization is due to odd-frequency\nspin-triplet Cooper pairs formed by electrons of equal and opposite spins,\nwhich are induced by proximity effect in the S/F1/N/F2/S junction. We find that\nthe magnetization M(d,q) in N can be decomposed into two parts,\nM(d,q)=MI(d)+MII(d,q), where q is the superconducting phase difference between\ntwo Ss and d is the thickness of N. MI(d) exists generally in S/F junctions,\nwhile MII(d,q) carries all q dependence and represents the fingerprint of phase\ncoherence between two Ss in Josephson junctions. The q dependence thus allows\nus to control the magnetization in N by tuning q for a fixed d. We show that\nMI(d) weakly decreases with increasing d, while the q dependent magnetization\nMII(d,q) rapidly decays with d. Moreover, we find that the time-averaged\nmagnetization <MII(d,q)> exhibits discontinuous peak at each resonance DC\nvoltage Vn=nhw_S/2e(n: integer) when DC voltage V as well as AC voltage v_ac(t)\nwith frequency w_S are both applied to the S/F1/N/F2/S junction.

We also discuss that\nthe magnetization induced in N can be measurably large in realistic systems.\nTherefore, the measurement of the induced magnetization serves as an\nalternative way to detect the phase coherence between two Ss in Josephson\njunctions.

Our study is based on the\nnonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory, and for the NESS we present a\nFloquet formulation adapted to electron-phonon systems. The analysis of the\nphonon propagator suggests that the effective attractive interaction can be\nstrongly enhanced in a parametric resonant regime because of the Floquet side\nbands of phonons. While this may be expected to enhance the superconductivity\n(SC), our fully self-consistent calculations, which include the effects of\nheating and nonthermal distributions, show that the parametric phonon driving\ngenerically results in a suppression or complete melting of the SC order. In\nthe strong coupling regime, the NESS always shows a suppression of the SC gap,\nthe SC order parameter and the superfluid density as a result of the driving,\nand this tendency is most prominent at the parametric resonance.

Matthias rule reconsidered Abstract: In part I of this paper a modified BCS mechanism of Cooper pair formation of\nelectrons was proposed. This mechanism is connected with the existence of a\nnarrow, roughly half-filled \"superconducting energy band\" of given symmetry.\nThe special symmetry of the superconducting band was interpreted within a\nnonadiabatic extension of the Heisenberg model of magnetism. Within this\nnonadiabatic Heisenberg model, the electrons of the superconducting band are\nconstrained to form Cooper pairs at zero temperature because in any normal\nconducting state the conservation of crystal-spin angular momentum would be\nviolated. Except for this participation of the angular momentum, the pair\nformation is mediated in the familiar way by phonons. Superconducting bands can\nbe identified even within a free-electron band structure. Therefore, in this\npaper the band structures of the bcc and hcp solid solution alloys composed of\ntransition elements are approximated by appropriate free-electron band\nstructures with s-d symmetry. From the free-electron bands, the number n of\nvalence electrons per atom related to the maxima of the superconducting\ntransition temperature Tc in these solid solutions is calculated within the\nnonadiabatic Heisenberg model.

The lowering of kinetic\nenergy, mainly in-plane in origin, accounts for both the condensation energy of\nthe superconductor as well as an increased potential energy due to larger\nCoulomb repulsion in the paired state.

It is\nexplained in the present paper why the only first order phase transition\nobserved on the way from the Abrikosov state in the normal state should be\ninterpreted as phase coherence disappearance. The false concept of vortex\nlattice melting appeared because of some causes main of them are erroneous\ninterpretation of direct observation of the Abrikosov state and the use by\ntheorists the habitual determination of phase coherence invalid for\nmulti-connected superconducting state. The distinguished work by A.A.

To elucidate this long-standing issue, we\nstudy a Hubbard model with a strong onsite impurity potential based on an\nimproved fluctuation-exchange (FLEX) approximation, which we call the GV^I-FLEX\nmethod. This model corresponds to the HTSC with dilute nonmagnetic impurity\nconcentration. We find that (i) both local and staggered susceptibilities are\nstrongly enhanced around the impurity. By this reason, (ii) the quasiparticle\nlifetime as well as the local density of states (DOS) are strongly suppressed\nin a wide area around the impurity (like a Swiss cheese hole), which causes the\n``huge residual resistivity'' beyond the s-wave unitary scattering limit. We\nstress that the excess quasiparticle damping rate caused by impurities has\nstrong momentum-dependence due to non-s-wave scatterings induced by many-body\neffects, so the structure of the ``hot spot/cold spot'' in the host system\npersists against impurity doping. This result could be examined by the ARPES\nmeasurements.

The smooth part of the Riemann counting formula of the\nzeros is reproduced exactly. The zeros appear, not as eigenstates, but as\nmissing states in the spectrum, in agreement with Connes adelic approach to the\nRiemann hypothesis. The model is exactly solvable and renormalizable, with a\ncyclic Renormalization Group. These results are obtained by mapping the\nBerry-Keating model into the Russian doll model of superconductivity. Finally,\nwe propose a generalization of these models in an attempt to explain the\noscillatory part of the Riemann's formula. \n\n"}

The concept of\nangular Bloch momentum is thus introduced to generalize the usual definition of\nangular momentum to cases where O(2) -symmetry no longer holds.

In these phases, a Cooper pair\ncarries total spin one. A systematic classification of theoretically possible\nphases, discriminated by the color-spin structure of the order parameter and\nthe respective symmetry breaking pattern, is presented. In the weak-coupling\nlimit, i.e., for asymptotically high densities, a universal form of the QCD gap\nequation is derived, applicable to arbitrary color-superconducting phases. It\nis applied to several spin-one and spin-zero phases in order to determine their\nenergy gaps and critical temperatures. In some of the spin-one phases the\nresulting gap function is anisotropic and has point or line nodes. It is shown\nthat the phases with two different gaps violate the well-known BCS relation\nbetween the critical temperature and the zero-temperature gap. Moreover, the\nscreening properties of color superconductors regarding gluons and photons are\ndiscussed. In particular, it turns out that, contrary to spin-zero color\nsuperconductors, spin-one color superconductors exhibit an electromagnetic\nMeissner effect. This property is proven by symmetry arguments as well as by an\nexplicit calculation of the gluon and photon Meissner masses. \n\n"}
