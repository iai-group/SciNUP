We moreover give\nexplicit formulas for algebraic connections on a class of finitely generated\nprojective modules on ellipsoid surfaces. The connections we construct are\nnon-flat with trace of curvature equal to zero. We construct these formulas\nusing an idempotent matrix $M$ defining the module $E$. Such an idempotent\nmatrix $M$ is constructed from a \"projective basis\" $B$ defining the module\n$E$. Associated to a projective basis $B$ for $E$ we construct a connection\n$\\nabla_B$. The curvature $R_{\\nabla_B}$ of the connection $\\nabla_B$ is given\nby a Lie product: $R_{\\nabla_B}(x,y):=[\\nabla_B(x)(M), \\nabla_B(y)(M)]$\ninvolving the matrix $M$, and this Lie product is non-zero in general. Hence\nthe curvature formula indicates that most projective finite rank modules do not\nhave a flat algebraic connection. We also give an explicit formula for a\nnon-flat algebraic connection on the cotangent bundle $\\Omega$ of the real\n2-sphere. The cotangent bundle $\\Omega$ is topologically non-trivial and it is\nnot clear if it has a flat algebraic connection.

For higher codimensional generic submanifolds,\nconvergence is proved e.g. under the assumption that the source is of finite\ntype, the target does not contain a nontrivial holomorphic variety, and the\nmapping is finite. Finite determination (by jets of a predetermined order) of\nformal mappings between smooth generic submanifolds is also established. \n\n"}

A\ncomplete study of various double reflection conditions is also provided. \n\n"}
