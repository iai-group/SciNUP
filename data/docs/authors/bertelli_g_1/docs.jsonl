Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on\nthe role that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in\nglobular clusters, e.g., influencing the distribution of horizontal branch\nstars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of some globular clusters, and in\nforming low mass white dwarfs. \n\n"}

As young AGN\n(quasars) they are initially several magnitudes sub-luminous to mature galaxies\nbut their luminosity gradually increases over 10^8 yrs, as z_(i) decreases and\nthey evolve into mature AGN (Seyferts and radio galaxies). Evidence presented\nhere that low- and intermediate-redshift AGN are unquestionably sub-luminous to\nradio galaxies is then strong support for this model and makes it likely that\nthe high-redshift AGN (quasars) are also sub-luminous, having simply been\npushed above the radio galaxies on a logz-m_(v) plot by the presence of a large\nintrinsic component in their redshifts. An increase in luminosity below z =\n0.06 is also seen.

The galaxy is known to possess a dramatic 70 kpc\nX-ray tail. The detected H-alpha tail coincides positionally with the X-ray\ntail. The H-alpha emission in the galaxy is sharply truncated on the front and\nthe sides near the nucleus, indicating significant ram pressure stripping. ESO\n137-001 is thus the first cluster late-type galaxy known unambiguously with\nboth an X-ray tail and an H-alpha tail. The emission-line objects are all\ndistributed downstream of the galaxy, with projected distance up to 39 kpc from\nthe galaxy. From the analysis on the H-alpha_{off} frame and the estimate of\nthe background emission-line objects, we conclude that it is very likely all 29\nemission-line objects are HII regions in A3627. The high surface number density\nand luminosities of these HII regions (up to 10^40 ergs/s) dwarf the previously\nknown examples of isolated HII regions in clusters.

A\nmodel of stochastic excitation by turbulent convection has been developed to\ncompute the excitation rates, and it has been successfully applied to solar\nradial modes (Samadi & Goupil 2001, Belkacem et al. 2006b). We generalize this\napproach to the case of non-radial global modes. This enables us to estimate\nthe energy supplied to high-($\\ell$) acoustic modes. Qualitative arguments as\nwell as numerical calculations are used to illustrate the results.

In this way we can assess when general relativistic results are\nimportant and we determine that this occur for distances of the order of 100M,\nwith M the total mass of the system.

A gravitational lensing\nestimate of the mass enclosed inside the Einstein circle can be obtained by\nmeasuring the Einstein angle, once the critical density of the system is known.\nA model-dependent dynamical estimate of this mass can also be obtained by\nmeasuring the central velocity dispersion of the stellar component. By assuming\nthe well-tested homologous 1/r^{2} profile for the total density distribution\nin the lens elliptical galaxies, these two mass measurements can be properly\ncompared. Thus, a relation between the Einstein angle and the central stellar\nvelocity dispersion is derived, and the cosmological matter and the dark-energy\ndensity parameters can be estimated from this. We determined the accuracy of\nthe cosmological parameter estimates by means of simulations that include\nrealistic measurement uncertainties on the relevant quantities. Interestingly,\nthe expected constraints on the cosmological parameter plane are complementary\nto those coming from other observational techniques. Then, we applied the\nmethod to the data sets of the Sloan Lens ACS and the Lenses Structure and\nDynamics Surveys, and showed that the concordance value between 0.7 and 0.8 for\nthe dark-energy density parameter is included in our 99% confidence regions.\nThe small number of lenses available to date prevents us from precisely\ndetermining the cosmological parameters, but it still proves the feasibility of\nthe method.

The three stages involves a neutron star phase, a quark star (QS)\nand a black hole phase as described in Staff et al. (2007). We find that the QS\nstage allows for more energy to be extracted from neutron star to QS conversion\nas well as from ensuing accretion onto the QS. The QS accretion phase naturally\nextends the engine activity and can account for both the prompt emission and\nirregular early X-ray afterglow activity. Following the accretion phase, the QS\ncan spin-down by emission of a baryon-free outflow. The magnetar-like magnetic\nfield strengths resulting from the NS to QS transition provide enough spin-down\nenergy, for the correct amount of time, to account for the plateau in the X-ray\nafterglow. In our model, a sharp drop-off following the plateau occurs when the\nQS collapses to a BH during the spin-down, thus shutting-off the secondary\noutflow.

Three\nscenarios have been suggested for their ejection; binary disruption by a MBH,\nscattering by inspiraling IMBH and scattering by stellar BHs close to MBH.\nThese scenarios involve different stellar populations in the Galactic center.\nHere we use observations of the Galactic center stellar population together\nwith dynamical and evolutionary arguments to obtain strong constraints on the\nnature and origin of HVSs. We show that the IMBH inspiral scenario requires too\nmany (O(10^3)) main sequence B stars to exist close to the MBH (<0.01 pc) at\nthe time of inspiral, where current observations show O(10) such stars.\nScattering by SBHs also require too many B stars to be observed in the GC, but\nit may contribute a small fraction of the currently observed HVSs.

The morphology of\nsatellites is determined by an automated morphology classifier, but the host\ngalaxies are visually classified. We found segregation of satellite morphology\nas a function of the projected distance from the host galaxy. The amplitude and\nshape of the early-type satellite fraction profile are found to depend on the\nhost luminosity. This is the morphology-radius/density relation at the galactic\nscale. There is a strong tendency for morphology conformity between the host\ngalaxy and its satellites. The early-type fraction of satellites hosted by\nearly-type galaxies is systematically larger than that of late-type hosts, and\nis a strong function of the distance from the host galaxies. Fainter satellites\nare more vulnerable to the morphology transformation effects of hosts.\nDependence of satellite morphology on the large-scale background density was\ndetected. The fraction of early-type satellites increases in high density\nregions for both early and late-type hosts. It is argued that the conformity in\nmorphology of galactic satellite system is mainly originated by the\nhydrodynamical and radiative effects of hosts on satellites. \n\n"}

It is confirmed that decays of\nNLSP staus to heavy gravitinos, while producing all the dark matter, may at the\nsame time resolve the Li7 problem.

Abstract: The detection of gamma-rays from dark matter (DM) annihilation is among the\nscientific goals of the Fermi Large Area Telescope (formerly known as GLAST)\nand Cherenkov telescopes. In this paper we investigate the existence of\nrealistic chances of such a discovery selecting some nearby dwarf spheroidal\ngalaxies (dSph) as a target. We study the detectability with the Fermi-LAT of\nthe gamma-ray flux from DM annihilation in Draco, Ursa Minor, Carina, and\nSextans, for which the state-of-art DM density profiles were available. We\nassume the DM is made of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles such as the\nLightest Supersymmetric Particle (LSP) and compute the expected gamma-ray flux\nfor optimistic choices of the unknown underlying particle physics parameters.\nWe then compute the boost factors due to the presence of DM clumps and of a\ncentral supermassive black hole. Finally, we compare our predictions with the\nFermi-LAT sensitivity maps. We find that the dSph galaxies shine above the\nGalactic smooth halo: e.g., the Galactic halo is brighter than the Draco dSph\nonly for angles smaller than 2.3 degrees above the Galactic Center. We also\nfind that the presence of a cusp or a constant density core in the DM mass\ndensity profile does not produce any relevant effect in the gamma-ray flux due\nto the fortunate combination of the geometrical acceptance of the Fermi-LAT\ndetector and the distance of the galaxies and that no significant enhancement\nis given by the presence of a central black hole or a population of\nsub-subhalos.

The Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability strips gas from these clouds. If the pressure and the the\nmetallicity of the corona are high enough, the stripped gas causes a similar\nmass of coronal gas to condense in the cloud's wake.

These confirm the existence of a\ncritical ablation rate above which the corona is condensed, and imply that for\nthe likely parameters of the Galactic corona this rate lies near the actual\nablation rate of clouds.

A single image of a planet, however, does not\nprovide evidence that the planet is Earth mass or that it is in a habitable\nzone orbit. The planet's orbit, however, can be measured either by imaging the\nplanet at multiple epochs or by measuring the position of the star at multiple\nepochs by space-based astrometry. The measurement of an exo-planet's orbit by\ndirect imaging is complicated by a number of factors: (1) the inner working\nangle (IWA); (2) the apparent brightness of the planet depending on the orbital\nphase; (3) confusion arising from the presence of multiple planets; and (4) the\nplanet-star contrast.

The sample represents the low-redshift AGN population over a wide range\nof luminosities, from Seyfert 1 galaxies to luminous quasars. From the\ndistribution of black hole masses we derived the active black hole mass\nfunction (BHMF) and the Eddington ratio distribution function (ERDF) in the\nlocal universe, exploiting the fact that the HES has a well-defined selection\nfunction. While the directly determined ERDF turns over around L/L_Edd ~ 0.1,\nsimilar to what has been seen in previous analyses, we argue that this is an\nartefact of the sample selection. We employed a maximum likelihood approach to\nestimate the intrinsic distribution functions of black hole masses and\nEddington ratios simultaneously in an unbiased way, taking the sample selection\nfunction fully into account. The resulting ERDF is well described by a\nSchechter function, with evidence for a steady increase towards lower Eddington\nratios, qualitatively similar to what has been found for type~2 AGN from the\nSDSS.

In the latter sense\neach source occupies a region (bin) in the FWHM(H-beta) vs. optical FeII\nstrength plane that is significantly different from the others.

We\ncan adequately model all broad lines assuming the existence of three components\ndistinguished by blueshifted, unshifted and redshifted centroids (indicated as\nblue, broad and very broad component respectively). The broad component (high\nelectron density, low ionization parameter; high column density) is present in\nalmost all type-1 quasars and therefore corresponds most closely to the\nclassical broad line emitting region (the reverberating component). The blue\ncomponent emission (lower electron density; high ionization; low column\ndensity) arises in less optically thick gas; it is often thought to arise in an\naccretion disk wind.

Abstract: It seems to be a widely accepted opinion that the types of accretion disks\n(or flows) generally realized in the nuclei of radio galaxies and in further\nlower mass-accretion rate nuclei are inner, hot, optically thin, radiatively\ninefficient accretion flows (RIAFs) surrounded by outer, cool, optically thick,\nstandard type accretion disks. However, observational evidence for the\nexistence of such outer cool disks in these nuclei is rather poor. Instead,\nrecent observations sometimes suggest the existence of inner cool disks of\nnon-standard type, which develop in the region very close to their central\nblack holes. Taking NGC 4261 as a typical example of such light eating nuclei,\nfor which both flux data ranging from radio to X-ray and data for the\ncounterjet occultation are available, we examine the plausibility of such a\npicture for the accretion states as mentioned above, based on model\npredictions. It is shown that the explanation of the gap seen in the counterjet\nemission in terms of the free-free absorption by an outer standard disk is\nunrealistic, and moreover, the existence itself of such an outer standard disk\nseems very implausible. Instead, the model of RIAF in an ordered magnetic field\n(so called resistive RIAF model) can well serve to explain the emission gap in\nterms of the synchrotron absorption, as well as to reproduce the observed\nfeatures of the overall spectral energy distribution (SED). This model also\npredicts that the RIAF state starts directly from an interstellar hot gas phase\nat around the Bondi radius and terminates at the inner edge whose radius is\nabout 100 times the Schwartzschild radii. Therefore, there is a good\npossibility for a cool disk to develop within this innermost region. \n\n"}

Reflecting the\nfeatures of the originally emitted neutrinos, the flux of nu_e and anti-nu_e at\nEarth is larger for larger survival probability of these species, and for\nstiffer equations of state of nuclear matter. In the energy window 19-29 MeV,\nthe flux from failed supernovae is susbtantial, ranging from 7% to a dominant\nfraction of the total flux from all core collapses. It can be as large as phi =\n0.38 s^{-1} cm^{-2} for anti-nu_e (phi = 0.28 s^{-1} cm^{-2} for nue),\nnormalized to a local rate of core collapses of R_{cc}(0)=10^{-4} yr^{-1}\nMpc^{-3}.

A novel approach is used to\nnumerically calculate the three-dimensional dark matter density field using SPT\nfrom the initial conditions of two high-resolution cosmological simulations.\nThe calculated density field is compared to the non-linear dark matter field of\nthe simulations both point-by-point and statistically. For smoothing scales\nabove 8 Mpc/h it shows a good agreement up to redshift 0. We present a simple\nfitting formula to relate the linear and non-linear density contrast that\naccurately recovers the non-linear time evolution for 0 <= z <= 10 at the per\ncent level. To address the problem of biasing between the matter field and the\nhaloes identified in the simulation, we employ the Eulerian local bias model\n(ELB), including non-linear bias up to the third order. The bias parameters are\nobtained by fitting a scatter plot of halo and matter density (both from the\nsimulation and from SPT). Using these bias parameters, we can reconstruct the\nhalo density field. We find that this reconstruction is not able to capture all\nthe details of the halo distribution. We investigate how well the large scale\nbias can be described by a constant and if it corresponds to the linear bias\nparameter b_1 of the local bias model.

Objects with masses comparable to normal globular\nclusters (GCs) are called extended clusters (ECs), while objects with masses in\nthe dwarf galaxy regime are called ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs). In\nheavily interacting galaxies star clusters tend to form in larger\nconglomerations called star cluster complexes (CCs).

The key to the algorithm is a maximum likelihood (ML) method for\njointly estimating both the luminosity function (LF) and the overdensity as a\nfunction of redshift. The random catalogue algorithm then works by cloning each\ngalaxy in the original catalogue, with the number of clones determined by the\nML solution. Each of these cloned galaxies is then assigned a random redshift\nuniformly distributed over the accessible survey volume, taking account of the\nsurvey magnitude limit(s) and, optionally, both luminosity and number density\nevolution. The resulting random catalogues, which can be employed in\ntraditional estimates of galaxy clustering, make fuller use of the information\navailable in the original catalogue and hence are superior to simply fitting a\nfunctional form to the observed redshift distribution. They are particularly\nwell suited to studies of the dependence of galaxy clustering on galaxy\nproperties as each galaxy in the random catalogue has the same list of\nattributes as measured for the galaxies in the genuine catalogue.

We show that spectral features can be explained in terms of the\nstellar wind collision model between the winds of the companion stars in which\nthe acceleration of particles occurs on both sides of the double shock\nstructure. The shocks from the Eta Carinae star and the companion star can\naccelerate particles to different energies depending on the different\nconditions determined by the parameters of the stars. The lack of strong GeV\ngamma-ray variability with the period of the binary system can be also\nunderstood in terms of such a model.

We analyzed the\nFourier power spectra of 430 selected light curves obtained by CoRoT during\nthree observation runs. The low-frequency contribution of the stellar\nvariability is modelled by a \"generalized semi-lorentzian\" profile. An activity\nindex is derived from the fitted amplitude and width of the semi-lorentzian\nmodel. Some of the Fourier spectra exhibit a rotational modulation which\nenables the determination of the rotation period. In addition, a convective\nturnover time is derived from a grid of stellar models, so that a Rossby number\ncan be estimated.

Simultaneously, the asymmetry of a\ngalaxy's stellar disk, in combination with other morphological parameters, has\nseen extensive use as an indication of recent merger or interaction in galaxy\nsamples. Quantified morphology of stellar spiral disks is one avenue to\ndetermine the merger rate over much of the age of the Universe. In this paper,\nwe measure the quantitative morphology parameters for the HI column density\nmaps from the Westerbork observations of neutral Hydrogen in Irregular and\nSPiral galaxies (WHISP). These are Concentration, Asymmetry, Smoothness, Gini,\nM20, and one addition of our own, the Gini parameter of the second order moment\n(GM). Our aim is to determine if lopsided or interacting disks can be\nidentified with these parameters. Our sample of 141 HI maps have all previous\nclassifications on their lopsidedness and interaction. We find that the\nAsymmetry, M20, and our new GM parameter correlate only weakly with the\nprevious morphological lopsidedness quantification. These three parameters may\nbe used to compute a probability that an HI disk is morphologically lopsided\nbut not unequivocally to determine it.

These timeseries allow\nus to derive asteroseismic global oscillation parameters of red-giant stars in\nthe three open clusters NGC 6791, NGC 6819 and NGC 6811.

The distance to the source,\nits transient nature, and high internal column density serve to complicate\nseveral means of estimating the mass of the black hole. Utilizing newly-refined\nrelationships between black hole mass, radio luminosity, and X-ray luminosity,\nand de-beaming the source flux, a weak constraint on the black hole mass is\nobtained: log(M/Msun) = 5.5 +/- 1.1 (1 sigma confidence). The confidence\ninterval is determined from the current intrinsic scatter in the relation,\nwhich includes effects from X-ray variability and accretion modes. This mass\nrange is broad, but it includes low values that are consistent with some\nvariability arguments, and it safely excludes high mass values where it becomes\nimpossible for black holes to disrupt stars.

Assuming the validity of the SSC model, the Hillas condition shows\nthat only in rare cases can such sources accelerate protons to much above 10^19\neV, so > 10^20 eV ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) are likely to be heavy\nions if powered by this type of radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN).\nSurvival of nuclei is shown to be possible in TeV BL Lacs and misaligned\ncounterparts with weak photohadronic emissions.

This\nis consistent with recent theoretical works, which indicate that the tidal Q of\nplanet-hosting stars can indeed be much larger than the values inferred from\nstellar binaries. On the other hand, recent measurements of Rossiter-McLaughlin\neffects in transiting hot Jupiter systems not only reveal that many such\nsystems have misaligned stellar spin with respect to the orbital axis, but also\nshow that systems with cooler host stars tend to have aligned spin and orbital\naxes. Winn et al. suggested that this obliquity - temperature correlation may\nbe explained by efficient damping of stellar obliquity due to tidal dissipation\nin the star. This explanation, however, is in apparent contradiction with the\nsurvival of these short-period hot Jupiters. We show that in the solar-type\nparent stars of close-in exoplanetary systems, the effective tidal Q governing\nthe damping of stellar obliquity can be much smaller than that governing\norbital decay. This is because for misaligned systems, the tidal potential\ncontains a Fourier component with frequency equal to the stellar spin frequency\n(in the rotating frame of the star). This component can excite inertial waves\nin the convective envelope of the star, and the dissipation of inertial waves\nthen leads to a spin-orbit alignment torque, but not orbital decay.

We show that\neven a relatively low level of viscosity (\\mu_{visc} >~ 3 g cm^{-1} s^{-1}, or\n~0.1% - 1% of Braginskii viscosity in this context) could effectively suppress\nthe development of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities at the bubble surface,\nresulting in smooth bubble edges as observed. Furthermore, viscosity reduces\ncirculating motions within the bubbles, which would otherwise mix the\nCR-carrying jet backflow near bubble edges with the bubble interior. Thus\nviscosity naturally produces an edge-favored CR distribution, an important\ningredient to produce the observed flat gamma-ray surface brightness\ndistribution.

We find self-similar solutions for the\nspherically-averaged profiles of mass density rho(r), pseudo phase-space\ndensity Q(r) and anisotropy parameter beta(r). These profiles agree with the\noutcomes of state-of-the-art N-body simulations in the radial range currently\nprobed by the latter; at smaller radii, we provide specific predictions. In the\nperspective provided by our self-similar solutions we link the halo structure\nto its two-stage growth history, and propose the following picture. During the\nearly fast collapse of the inner region dominated by a few merging clumps,\nefficient dynamical relaxation plays a key role in producing a closely\nuniversal mass density and pseudo phase-space density profiles; in particular,\nthese are found to depend only weakly on the detailed shape of the initial\nperturbation and the related collapse times.

(2011). We confirm six Lyman Alpha emitters (LAEs), three of which have\nsignificant asymmetric line profiles with prominent wings extending 300-400\nkm/s redward of the peak emission. With these six LAEs, we revise our previous\nestimate of the number of faint LAEs in the Dressler et al. survey. Combining\nthese data with the density of bright LAEs in the Cosmic Origins Survey and\nSubaru Deep Field provides the best constraints to date on the redshift 5.7 LAE\nluminosity function (LF). Schechter function parameters, phi^* = 4.5 x 10^{-4}\nMpc^{-3}, L^* = 9.1 x 10^{42} erg s^{-1}, and alpha= -1.70, are estimated using\na maximum likelihood technique with a model for slit losses. To place this\nresult in the context of the UV-selected galaxy population, we investigate how\nvarious parameterizations of the Lyman Alpha equivalent width distribution,\nalong with the measured UV-continuum LF, affect shape and normalization of the\nLyman Alpha LF. The nominal model, which uses z~6 equivalent widths from the\nliterature, falls short of the observed space density of LAEs at the bright\nend, possibly indicating a need for higher equivalent widths. This\nparameterization of the equivalent width distribution implies that as many as\n50% of our faintest LAEs should have M_{UV} > -18.0, rendering them\nundetectable in even the deepest Hubble Space Telescope surveys at this\nredshift. Hence, ultra-deep emission-line surveys find some of the faintest\ngalaxies ever observed at the end of the reionization epoch. Such faint\ngalaxies likely enrich the intergalactic medium with metals and maintain its\nionized state.

However, small numbers of stars in\nthese regions with inferred ages of >= 5-10 Myr have been cited to argue that\nstar formation is instead a slow, quasi-static process. When considering these\nalternative pictures it is important to recognize that the age spread in a\ngiven star-forming cloud is necessarily an upper limit to the timescales of\nlocal collapse, as not all spatially-distinct regions will start contracting at\nprecisely the same instant. Moreover, star-forming clouds may dynamically\nevolve on timescales of a few Myr; in particular, global gravitational\ncontraction will tend to yield increasing star formation rates with time due to\ngenerally increasing local gas densities.

Its light curve exhibits a slower decline rate than normal\nSNeIbc, with a peak absolute magnitude of -19.5 (unfiltered) and a secondary\npeak of -18.3 mag (R). Spectra of SN2011hw are unusual compared to normal SN\ntypes, most closely resembling the spectra of SNeIbn. We center our analysis on\ncomparing SN 2011hw to the well-studied TypeIbn SN2006jc. While the two SNe\nhave many important similarities, the differences are quite telling: compared\nto SN2006jc, SN2011hw has weaker HeI and CaII lines and relatively stronger H\nlines, its light curve has a higher luminosity and slower decline rate, and\nemission lines associated with the progenitor's CSM are narrower. One can\nreproduce the unusual continuum shape of SN2011hw with equal contributions of a\n6000K blackbody and a spectrum of SN2006jc.

The optical\nspectrum exhibits broad emission features of [O I], [O II], [O III], H-alpha,\nH-beta, and [Fe II]. The last decade of evolution has exhibited a strengthening\nof the oxygen transitions, evidence that the late-time emission is powered by\nincreasingly metal-rich SN ejecta crossing the reverse shock. The H-alpha\nluminosity requires that SN 1998S is still interacting with dense circumstellar\nmaterial (CSM), probably produced by the strong wind of a red supergiant\nprogenitor at least ~1000 years before explosion. The emission lines exhibit\nasymmetric blueshifted profiles, which implies that the receding hemisphere of\nthe SN is obscured by dust. The [O III] line, in particular, exhibits a\ncomplete suppression of its red wing. This could be the result of the expected\nwavelength dependence for dust extinction or a smaller radial distribution for\n[O III]. In the latter case, the red wing of [O III] could be absorbed by core\ndust, while both the blue and red wings are absorbed by dust within the cool\ndense shell between the forward and reverse shocks; this interpretation could\nexplain why late-time [O III] emission from SNe is often weaker than models\npredict. The [O I] line exhibits double-peaked structure on top of the broader\nunderlying profile, possibly due to emission from individual clumps of ejecta\nor ring-like structures of metal-rich debris. The centroids of the peaks are\nblueshifted and lack a red counterpart. However, an archival spectrum obtained\non day 1093 exhibits a third, redshifted peak, which we suspect has become\nextinguished by dust that formed over the last decade.

An important aspect of the disc secular\nevolution driven by these perturbers is the radial migration of stars. It has\nbeen suggested recently that migration can populate a thick-disc component from\ninner-disc stars with high vertical energies. Since this has never been\ndemonstrated in simulations, we study in detail the effect of radial migration\non the disc velocity dispersion and disc thickness, by separating simulated\nstars into migrators and non-migrators. We apply this method to three isolated\nbarred Tree-SPH N-body galaxies with strong radial migration. Contrary to\nexpectations, we find that as stellar samples migrate, on the average, their\nvelocity dispersion change (by as much as 50%) in such a way as to\napproximately match the non-migrating population at the radius at which they\narrive. We show that, in fact, migrators suppress heating in parts of the disc.\nTo confirm the validity of our findings, we also apply our technique to three\ncosmological re-simulations, which use a completely different simulation scheme\nand, remarkably, find very similar results. We believe the inability of\nmigration to thicken discs is a fundamental property of internal disc\nevolution, irrespective of the migration mechanism at work.

These simple, model-independent strategies\nreduce the set of assumptions to near axisymmetry of the disc and are designed\nfor kinematically hot stars, which are less affected by spiral arms and other\neffects. The first two methods use the position-dependent rotational streaming\nin the heliocentric radial velocities U. The resulting rotation estimate\n{\\theta} from U velocities does not depend on Vg,\\odot. The first approach\ncompares this with rotation from the galactic azimuthal velocities to constrain\nVg,\\odot at an assumed R0. Both Vg,\\odot and R0 can be determined using the\nproper motion of Sgr A\\ast as a second constraint. The second strategy makes\nuse of {\\theta} being roughly proportional to R0. Therefore a wrong R0 can be\ndetected by an unphysical trend of Vg,\\odot with the intrinsic rotation of\ndifferent populations.

This feature occurs naturally when resonant couples undergo dissipation\nthat damps the eccentricities. However, the resonant angles appear to librate\nat the end of the migration process, which is often believed to be an evidence\nthat the systems remain in resonance.\n  Here we provide an analytical model for the dissipation in resonant planetary\nsystems valid for low eccentricities. We confirm that dissipation accounts for\nan excess of pairs that lie just aside from the nominal periods ratios, as\nobserved by the Kepler mission. In addition, by a global analysis of the phase\nspace of the problem, we demonstrate that these final pairs are non-resonant.\nIndeed, the separatrices that exist in the resonant systems disappear with the\ndissipation, and remains only a circulation of the orbits around a single\nelliptical fixed point. Furthermore, the apparent libration of the resonant\nangles can be explained using the classical secular averaging method. We show\nthat this artifact is only due to the severe damping of the amplitudes of the\neigenmodes in the secular motion. \n\n"}

We measured a nucleus rotation period of\n8.950 +/- 0.002 hr from 2010 September to 2011 January. This rotation period is\nlonger than the period we previously measured in 1999, which was itself longer\nthan the period measured in 1988. A nearly linear jet was observed which varied\nlittle during a rotation cycle in both R and CN images acquired during the 1999\nand 2010 apparitions. We measured the projected direction of this jet\nthroughout the two apparitions and, under the assumption that the source region\nof the jet was near the comet's pole, determined a rotational pole direction of\nRA/Dec = 151deg/+59deg from CN measurements and RA/Dec = 173deg/+57deg from\ndust measurements (we estimate a circular uncertainty of 3deg for CN and 4deg\nfor dust).

Abstract: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are powered by magnetic energy stored in\nelectric currents in coronal magnetic fields, with the pre-CME field in balance\nbetween outward magnetic pressure of the proto-ejecta and inward magnetic\ntension from confining overlying fields. In studies of global, current-free\ncoronal magnetic field models --- Potential-Field Source-Surface (PFSS) models\n--- it has been reported that model field strengths above flare sites tend to\nbe weaker in when CMEs occur than when eruptions fail to occur. This suggests\nthat potential field models might usefully quantify magnetic confinement. An\nimplication of this idea is that a decrease in model field strength overlying a\npossible eruption site should correspond to diminished confinement, implying an\neruption is more likely. We have searched for such an effect by {\\em post\nfacto} investigation of the time evolution of model field strengths above a\nsample of 10 eruption sites, which included both slow and fast CMEs. In most\nevents we study, we find no statistically significant evolution in either: (i)\nthe rate of magnetic field decay with height; (ii) the strength of overlying\nmagnetic fields near 50 Mm; (iii) or the ratio of fluxes at low and high\naltitudes (below 1.1$R_{\\odot}$, and between 1.1--1.5$R_{\\odot}$,\nrespectively). Instead, we found that overlying field strengths and overlying\nflux tend to increase slightly, and their rates of decay with height become\nslightly more gradual, consistent with increased confinement. Since CMEs occur\nregardless of whether the parameters we use to quantify confinement are\nincreasing or decreasing, either: (i) these parameters do not accurately\ncharacterize confinement in CME source regions; or (ii) systematic evolution in\nthe large-scale magnetic environment of CME source regions is not, by itself, a\nnecessary condition for CMEs to occur; or both. \n\n"}

(1998) over-estimates E(B-V) by about 14 per\ncent, consistent with the recent work of Schlafly et al.

Using the Ks-band\nextinction coefficient predicted by the R(V) = 3.1 Fitzpatrick law and the\nobserved reddening coefficients, we have deduced new extinction coefficients\nfor the FUV, NUV, u, g, r, i, z, J, H, W1 and W2 passbands.

For axion masses above about 10^-4 eV, resonant mode conversion at a\nlayer where the axion mass matches the local electron plasma frequency is\nnecessary. For axion masses above about 10^-2 eV, this mode conversion occurs\ntoo deep in the solar atmosphere for the resulting photon to escape the solar\nsurface and be detected before Compton scattering obscures the line. At the\n(detectable) axion masses below this, the flux of mode converted photons\npredicted by axion models appears to be too low for detection to be feasible\nwith current instrumentation.

Wolf-Rayet stars are the\nmost plausible LGRB progenitors, since the free-fall time of the envelope is\nconsistent with the duration, and the natural outcome of the progenitor is a\nType Ic SN. While a new population of ultra-long GRBs (ULGRBs), GRB 111209A,\nGRB 101225A, and GRB 121027A, has a duration of ~ 10^4 s, two of them are\naccompanied by superluminous-supernova (SLSN) like bumps, which are <~ 10 times\nbrighter than typical hypernovae. Wolf-Rayet progenitors cannot explain ULGRBs\nbecause of too long duration and too bright SN-like bump. A blue supergiant\n(BSG) progenitor model, however, can explain the duration of ULGRBs. Moreover,\nSLSN-like bump can be attributed to the so-called cocoon-fireball photospheric\nemissions (CFPEs).

Different models are used to\nconstrain the scatter of SSFR for lower mass galaxies that are mostly\nundetected at 24 micron. The SFR scatter is dominated by the scatter of UV\nluminosity and gradually that of IR luminosity at increasing stellar mass. We\nderive SSFR dispersions of 0.18, 0.21, 0.26 and 0.31 dex with a typical\nmeasurement uncertainty of <~ 0.01 dex for the four mass bins.

Dark\nmatter particles may represent ideal gas of non-interacting particles.\nSelf-interacting dark matter weakly or superweakly coupled to ordinary matter\nis also possible, reflecting nontrivial pattern of particle symmetry in the\nhidden sector of particle theory. In the early Universe the structure of\nparticle symmetry breaking gives rise to cosmological phase transitions, from\nwhich macroscopic cosmological defects or primordial nonlinear structures can\nbe originated. Primordial black holes (PBHs) can be not only a candidate for\ndark matter, but also represent a universal probe for super-high energy physics\nin the early Universe.

The governing linear equations and appropriate boundary conditions,\nincluding gravitational terms, are derived and applied to the case of the RTI\nin a single interface between two partially ionized plasmas.

We\ndemonstrate one of the first uses of the properties of the radio relic to\nreduce the uncertainties of the dynamical variables and determine the 3D\nconfiguration of a cluster merger, ACT-CL J0102-4915, nicknamed El Gordo. From\nthe double radio relic observation and the X-ray observation of a comet-like\ngas morphology induced by motion of the cool core, it is widely believed that\nEl Gordo is observed shortly after the first core-passage of the subclusters.\nWe employ a Monte Carlo simulation to investigate the three-dimensional (3D)\nconfiguration and dynamics of El Gordo. Using the polarization fraction of the\nradio relic, we constrain the estimate of the angle between the plane of the\nsky and the merger axis to be $\\alpha = 21~{\\rm degree} \\pm^9_{11}$. We find\nthe relative 3D merger speed of El Gordo to be $2400\\pm^{400}_{200}~{\\rm\nkm}~{\\rm s}^{-1}$ at pericenter. The two possible estimates of the\ntime-since-pericenter are $0.46\\pm^{0.09}_{0.16}$ Gyr and\n$0.91\\pm^{0.22}_{0.39}$ Gyr for the outgoing and returning scenario\nrespectively. We put our estimates of the time-since-pericenter into context by\nshowing that if the time-averaged shock velocity is approximately equal to or\nsmaller than the pericenter velocity of the corresponding subcluster in the\ncenter of mass frame, the two subclusters are more likely to be moving towards,\nrather than away, from each other, post apocenter. We compare and contrast the\nmerger scenario of El Gordo with that of the Bullet Cluster, and show that this\nlate-stage merging scenario explains why the southeast dark matter lensing peak\nof El Gordo is closer to the merger center than the southeast cool core. \n\n"}

The flux dips vary\nconsiderably in their depth from epoch to epoch, but usually persist for\nseveral weeks and, in two cases, were present in data collected on successive\nyears. For several of these stars, we also measure the photospheric rotation\nperiod and find that the rotation and dip periods are the same, as predicted by\nstandard \"disk-locking\" models.

METHODS: Using high-resolution spectra obtained with MIKE, FEROS,\nSOFIN, FIES, UVES and HARPS spectrographs, we determine Sc, V, Mn, and Co\nabundances for a large sample of F and G dwarfs in Solar neighbourhood. The\nmethod is based on spectral synthesis and using one-dimensional (1-D),\nplane-parallel, LTE model stellar atmospheres calculated with the MARCS 2012\ncode. NLTE corrections from literature were applied to Mn and Co. RESULTS: We\nfind that the abundance trends derived for Sc (594 stars), V (466 stars), and\nCo (567 stars) are very similar to what has been observed for the\nalpha-elements in the thin and thick disks. On the contrary Mn (569 stars) is\ngenerally underabundant relative to the Sun (i.e. [Mn/Fe]<0) for [Fe/H]<0.\nAlso, for Mn, when NLTE corrections are applied, the trend changes and is\nalmost flat over the entire metallicity range that the stars in our sample span\n(-2<[Fe/H]<+0.4). The [Sc/Fe]-[Fe/H] abundance trends show a small separation\nbetween the thin and thick disks, while for V and Co they completely overlap.\nFor Mn there is a small difference in [Mn/Fe] but only when NLTE corrections\nare used. Comparisons with Ti as a reference element show flat trends for all\nthe elements except for Mn that show well separated [Mn/Ti]-[Ti/H] trends for\nthe thin and thick disks. CONCLUSIONS: Sc and V present trends compatible with\nproduction from SNII events. In addition, Sc clearly shows a metallicity\ndependence for [Fe/H]<-1.

The temperature and luminosity of the UV burst match the theoretical\npredictions for shock breakout in a red supergiant, but with a duration a\nfactor of ~50 longer than expected. We compare the $NUV$ light curve of\nPS1-13arp to previous GALEX detections of Type IIP SNe, and find clear\ndistinctions that indicate that the UV emission is powered by shock breakout,\nand not by the subsequent cooling envelope emission previously detected in\nthese systems.

A collisionless shock (CS) is usually assumed to\nreplace it during shock breakout (SB). We demonstrate here that for some\nrealistic progenitors enshrouded in optically thick winds, such as possibly SN\n2008D, a CS forms deep inside the wind, soon after the RDS leaves the core, and\ntherefore significantly before SB. The RDS does not survive the transition from\nthe core to the thick wind when the wind close to the core is not sufficiently\ndense to compensate for the $r^{-2}$ dilution of photons due to shock\ncurvature. This typically happens when the shock velocity is $\\lesssim 0.1 {\\rm\nc} \\, (\\frac{u_{\\rm w}}{10\\,{\\rm km/s}}) (\\frac{\\dot{M}}{5 \\cdot 10^{-4} \\,\n{\\rm M}_\\odot {\\rm /yr}})^{-1} (\\frac{r_\\ast}{10^{13}\\,{\\rm cm}})$, where\n$u_{\\rm w}$, $\\dot{M}$ and $r_\\ast$ are respectively the wind velocity,\nmass-loss rate and radius of the progenitor star.

Initially the amplification is well-described\nby linear perturbation theory around the SO(2,1) background, but the onset of\nstrong nonlinearities amongst the fluctuations quickly leads to a drastic\nbreaking of the original SO(2,1) symmetry and the production of oscillons in\nthe collision region.

Here we propose that high-temperature TDEs are produced when the\ntidal debris of a disrupted star self-intersects relatively close to the\nsupermassive black hole, in contrast to the more distant self-intersection that\nleads to lower color temperatures. In particular, we note from simple ballistic\nconsiderations that greater apsidal precession in an orbit is the key to closer\nself-intersection. Thus larger values of $\\beta$, the ratio of the tidal radius\nto the pericenter distance of the initial orbit, are more likely to lead to\nhigher temperatures of more compact disks which are super-Eddington and\ngeometrically and optically thick. For a given star and $\\beta$, apsidal\nprecession also increases for larger black hole masses, but larger black hole\nmasses imply a lower temperature at the Eddington luminosity. Thus the expected\ndependence of the temperature on the mass of the black hole is non-monotonic.\nWe find that in order to produce a soft X-ray temperature TDE, a deep plunging\nstellar orbit with $\\beta> 3$ is needed and a black hole mass of $\\lesssim\n5\\times 10^6 M_\\odot$ is favored.

Notably, because\nof their low mass, most of their interactions will be with dark satellites. In\nthis paper we follow the evolution of gas-rich disky dwarf galaxies as they\nexperience a minor merger with a dark satellite. We aim to characterize the\neffects of such an interaction on the dwarf's star formation, morphology, and\nkinematical properties. We performed a suite of carefully set-up hydrodynamical\nsimulations of dwarf galaxies that include dark matter, gas, and stars merging\nwith a satellite consisting solely of dark matter. For the host system we vary\nthe gas fraction, disk size and thickness, halo mass, and concentration, while\nwe explore different masses, concentrations, and orbits for the satellite. We\nfind that the interactions cause strong starbursts of both short and long\nduration in the dwarfs. Their star formation rates increase by factors of a few\nto 10 or more. They are strongest for systems with extended gas disks and high\ngas fractions merging with a high-concentration satellite on a planar, radial\norbit. In contrast to analogous simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies, many of\nthe systems experience strong morphological changes and become spheroidal even\nin the presence of significant amounts of gas. The simulated systems compare\nremarkably well with the observational properties of a large selection of\nirregular dwarf galaxies and blue compact dwarfs.

In the central regions, they become shallower and reach on\naverage $\\sim r^{-1}$, the asymptotic form of an NFW profile. Using\nnon-cosmological controlled simulations, we observe that temporal variations in\nthe gravitational potential caused by major mergers lead to a shallowing of the\ninner profile. This transformation is more significant for shallower initial\nprofiles and for a higher number of merging systems. Depending on the merger\ndetails, the resulting profiles can be shallower or steeper than NFW in their\ninner regions. Interestingly, mergers have a much weaker effect when the\nprofile is given by a broken power-law with an inner slope of $-1$ (such as NFW\nor Hernquist profiles).

We applied a cloud-free 1D radiative-convective\nclimate model to calculate the climate of Earth-like planets around different\ntypes of main-sequence stars with varying surface albedo and relative humidity\nprofile. These parameters depend on climate feedbacks that are not treated\nself-consistently in most 1D models.

The intensity profiles of iron and oxygen in Solar Energetic\nParticle (SEP) events often display differences that result in a decreasing\nFe/O ratio over time. The physical mechanisms behind this behaviour are not\nfully understood, but these observational signatures provide important tests of\nphysical modelling efforts. Aims. In this paper we study the propagation of\niron and oxygen SEP ions using a 3D model of propagation which includes the\neffect of guiding centre drift in a Parker spiral magnetic field. We derive\ntime intensity profiles for a variety of observer locations and study the\ntemporal evolution of the Fe/O ratio. Methods. We use a 3D full orbit test\nparticle model which includes scattering. The configuration of the\ninterplanetary magnetic field is a unipolar Parker spiral. Particles are\nreleased instantaneously from a compact region at 2 solar radii and allowed to\npropagate in 3D. Results. Both Fe and O experience significant transport across\nthe magnetic field due to gradient and curvature drifts. We find that Fe ions\ndrift more than O ions due to their larger mass-to-charge ratio, so that an\nobserver that is not magnetically well connected to the source region will\nobserve Fe arriving before O, for particles within the same range in energy per\nnucleon. As a result, for the majority of observer locations, the Fe/O ratio\ndisplays a decrease in time. Conclusions.

We test whether this correlation extends to galaxies by measuring the\ndependence of galaxy stellar age on $\\rho$. To clarify the comparison between\ntheory and observation, and to remove the strong environmental effects on\nsatellites, we use galaxy group catalogs to identify central galaxies and\nmeasure their quenched fraction, $f_Q$, as a function of large-scale\nenvironment. Models that match halo age to central galaxy age predict a strong\npositive correlation between $f_Q$ and $\\rho$. However, we show that the\namplitude of this effect depends on the definition of halo age: assembly bias\nis significantly reduced when removing the effects of splashback halos---those\nhalos that are central but have passed through a larger halo or experienced\nstrong tidal encounters. Defining age using halo mass at its peak value rather\nthan current mass removes these effects.

A Close Look at the Large\n  Magellanic Cloud and a New Orbital History for M33 Abstract: The Milky Way (MW) and M31 both harbor massive satellite galaxies, the Large\nMagellanic Cloud (LMC) and M33, which may comprise up to 10 per cent of their\nhost's total mass. Massive satellites can change the orbital barycentre of the\nhost-satellite system by tens of kiloparsecs and are cosmologically expected to\nharbor dwarf satellite galaxies of their own. Assessing the impact of these\neffects depends crucially on the orbital histories of the LMC and M33. Here, we\nrevisit the dynamics of the MW-LMC system and present the first detailed\nanalysis of the M31-M33 system utilizing high precision proper motions and\nstatistics from the dark matter-only Illustris cosmological simulation. With\nthe latest Hubble Space Telescope proper motion measurements of M31, we\nreliably constrain M33's interaction history with its host. In particular, like\nthe LMC, M33 is either on its first passage (t_{inf} < 2 Gyr ago) or if M31 is\nmassive (>=2x10^12 Msun), it is on a long period orbit of about 6 Gyr.\nCosmological analogs of the LMC and M33 identified in Illustris support this\npicture and provide further insight about their host masses. We conclude that,\ncosmologically, massive satellites like the LMC and M33 are likely completing\ntheir first orbits about their hosts. We also find that the orbital energies of\nsuch analogs prefer a MW halo mass ~1.5x10^12 Msun and an M31 halo mass\n>=1.5x10^12 Msun. Despite conventional wisdom, we conclude it is highly\nimprobable that M33 made a close (< 100 kpc) approach to M31 recently (\nt_{peri} < 3 Gyr ago). Such orbits are rare (< 1 per cent) within the 4$\\sigma$\nerror space allowed by observations. This conclusion cannot be explained by\nperturbative effects through four body encounters between the MW, M31, M33, and\nthe LMC. This surprising result implies that we must search for a new\nexplanation for M33's strongly warped gas and stellar discs. \n\n"}

Halo-to-Halo Variance Abstract: We present a study of unprecedented statistical power regarding the\nhalo-to-halo variance of dark matter substructure. Using a combination of\nN-body simulations and a semi-analytical model, we investigate the variance in\nsubhalo mass fractions and subhalo occupation numbers, with an emphasis on how\nthese statistics scale with halo formation time. We demonstrate that the\nsubhalo mass fraction, f_sub, is mainly a function of halo formation time, with\nearlier forming haloes having less substructure. At fixed formation redshift,\nthe average f_sub is virtually independent of halo mass, and the mass\ndependence of f_sub is therefore mainly a manifestation of more massive haloes\nassembling later. We compare observational constraints on f_sub from\ngravitational lensing to our model predictions and simulation results. Although\nthe inferred f_sub are substantially higher than the median LCDM predictions,\nthey fall within the 95th percentile due to halo-to-halo variance. We show that\nwhile the halo occupation distribution of subhaloes, P(N|M), is\nsuper-Poissonian for large <N>, a well established result, it becomes\nsub-Poissonian for <N> < 2. Ignoring the non-Poissonity results in systematic\nerrors of the clustering of galaxies of a few percent, and with a complicated\nscale- and luminosity-dependence. Earlier-formed haloes have P(N|M) closer to a\nPoisson distribution, suggesting that the dynamical evolution of subhaloes\ndrives the statistics towards Poissonian. Contrary to a recent claim, the\nnon-Poissonity of subhalo occupation statistics does not vanish by selecting\nhaloes with fixed mass and fixed formation redshift. Finally, we use subhalo\noccupation statistics to put loose constraints on the mass and formation\nredshift of the Milky Way halo.

Two types of GRBs are observed:\nspectrally harder short duration bursts and softer long duration bursts.

The analysis confirms the existence of a low variance in the CMB at\nlarge scales, which is also noticeable in the derivatives. Moreover, deviations\nfrom the standard model in the gradient, curvature and the eccentricity tensor\nare studied in terms of extreme values on the data.

We\nconsider a model of the giant planets migration known as the jumping Jupiter\nmodel with five planets. Our study is focused on the period of 10 Myr that\nencompasses the instability phase of the giant planets.

Using a\nBayesian framework we construct two models - one that includes and one that\nexcludes gravitational planet-planet interactions (PPI). We find that the\norbital parameters from our PPI and noPPI models differ by up to $2\\sigma$,\nwith our noPPI model being statistically consistent with previous results. In\naddition, our new PPI model strongly favours the planets being in MMR while our\nnoPPI model strongly disfavours MMR. We conduct a stability analysis by drawing\nsamples from our PPI model's posterior distribution and simulating them for\n$10^9$ years, finding that our best-fit values land firmly in a stable region\nof parameter space.\n  We explore a series of formation models that migrate the planets into their\nobserved MMR. We then use these models to directly fit to the observed RV data,\nwhere each model is uniquely parameterized by only three constants describing\nits migration history. Using a Bayesian framework we find that a number of\nmigration models fit the RV data surprisingly well, with some migration\nparameters being ruled out.\n  Our analysis shows that planet-planet interactions are important to take into\naccount when modelling observations of multi-planetary systems. The additional\ninformation that one can gain from interacting models can help constrain planet\nmigration parameters. \n\n"}

At cosmological scales, inferred dynamics are also\ninconsistent with GR and the observed distribution of mass. The current\naccelerated expansion rate requires the introduction of a hypothetical dark\nenergy dominant component. We here show that for a Schwarzschild metric at\ngalactic scales, the scalar curvature, K, multiplied by $(r^{4}/M)$ at the\ncritical MOND transition radius, $r=R_{c}$, has an invariant value of\n$\\kappa_{B}=K(r^{4}/M)=28Ga_{0}/c^{4}$. Further, assuming this condition holds\nfor $r>R_{c}$, is consistent with the full spacetime which under GR corresponds\nto a dominant isothermal dark matter halo, to within observational precision at\ngalactic level. For a FLRW metric, this same constant bounding curvature\ncondition yields for a spatially flat spacetime a cosmic expansion history\nwhich agrees with the $\\Lambda$CDM empirical fit for recent epochs, and which\nsimilarly tends asymptotically to a de Sitter solution. Thus, a simple\ncovariant purely geometric condition identifies the low acceleration regime of\nobserved gravitational anomalies, and can be used to guide the development of {\nextended} gravity theories at both galactic and cosmological scales. \n\n"}

Abstract: The ambitious goals of precision cosmology with wide-field optical surveys\nsuch as the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope\n(LSST) demand, as their foundation, precision CCD astronomy. This in turn\nrequires an understanding of previously uncharacterized sources of systematic\nerror in CCD sensors, many of which manifest themselves as static effective\nvariations in pixel area. Such variation renders a critical assumption behind\nthe traditional procedure of flat fielding--that a sensor's pixels comprise a\nuniform grid--invalid. In this work, we present a method to infer a curl-free\nmodel of a sensor's underlying pixel grid from flat field images, incorporating\nthe superposition of all electrostatic sensor effects--both known and\nunknown--present in flat field data. We use these pixel grid models to estimate\nthe overall impact of sensor systematics on photometry, astrometry, and PSF\nshape measurements in a representative sensor from the Dark Energy Camera\n(DECam) and a prototype LSST sensor.

Such measurements provide statistical constraints that can be used to\ninform our understanding of the initial conditions of planet formation. We\nanalyze spatially resolved observations of 36 protoplanetary disks in the Lupus\nstar forming complex from our ALMA survey at 890 micron, aiming to determine\nphysical properties such as the dust surface density, the disk mass and size\nand to provide a constraint on the temperature profile. We fit the observations\ndirectly in the uv-plane using a two-layer disk model that computes the 890\nmicron emission by solving the energy balance at each disk radius. For 22 out\nof 36 protoplanetary disks we derive robust estimates of their physical\nproperties. The sample covers stellar masses between ~0.1 and ~2 Solar masses,\nand we find no trend between the average disk temperatures and the stellar\nparameters.

Following Paper I, here\nwe numerically study the late stage of terrestrial planet formation, i.e., from\nembryos to full planets, in binary systems of various orbital configurations.\nWe identify an orbital alignment or anti-alignment effect; namely, although an\ninclined binary generally misaligns the planetary orbits with respect to the\nspin axis of the primary host star (i.e., causing large obliquity), it could\nalign or anti-align the planetary orbits with respect to the binary orbit. Such\nan orbital (anti-)alignment effect is caused by the combination of orbital\ndifferential precession and self-damping, and it is mostly significant in cases\nof intermediate binary separations, i.e., a_B~40-200 AU for terrestrial planet\nformation around 1 AU from the primary stars. In such intermediate separation\nbinaries, somewhat contrary to intuition, the binary companion can aid planet\ngrowth by having increased the rate of collisions, forming significantly more\nmassive but fewer planets. In the other two ends, the companion is ether too\nclose thus plays a violently disruptive role or too wide to have significant\neffect on planet formation.

We aim to\nconstrain radial differential rotation profiles in gamma Doradus (gamma Dor)\nstars, and to develop new theoretical seismic diagnosis for such stars with\nrapid and potentially non-uniform rotation. Methods. We derive a new asymptotic\ndescription which accounts for the impact of weak differential near-core\nrotation on gravity- mode period spacings. The theoretical predictions are\nillustrated from pulsation computations with the code GYRE and compared with\nobservations of gamma Dor stars. When possible, we also derive the surface\nrotation rates in these stars by detecting and analysing signatures of\nrotational modulation, and compute the core-to-surface rotation ratios.\nResults. Stellar rotation has to be strongly differential before its effects on\nperiod spacing patterns can be detected, unless multiple period spacing\npatterns can be compared. Six stars in our sample exhibit a single unexplained\nperiod spacing pattern of retrograde modes. We hypothesise that these are Yanai\nmodes.

If only one period spacing\npattern is detected and analysed for a star, it is difficult to detect\ndifferential rotation. A rigidly rotating model will often provide the best\nsolution.

The key to numerically solving the GS equation is to enable\nmagnetic field lines smoothly cross the LS, and crossing a straight LS in flat\nspacetime has been a well-studied problem.

The lines are\nnot detected down to 3 sigma levels in 0.2 km/s channels of around 6 mK. The\nnon-detection provides the lower limit of the 14N/15N ratio for N2D+ of\n~700-800, which is much higher than the elemental abundance ratio in the local\nISM of ~200-300. The result indicates that N2 is depleted in 15N in the central\npart of L1544, because N2D+ preferentially traces the cold dense gas, and\nbecause it is a daughter molecule of N2. In-situ chemistry is unlikely\nresponsible for the 15N depletion in N2; neither low-temperature gas phase\nchemistry nor isotope selective photodissociation of N2 explains the 15N\ndepletion; the former prefers transferring 15N to N2, while the latter requires\nthe penetration of interstellar FUV photons into the core center.

FGs are indeed characterized by a large magnitude gap between their\ncentral and surrounding galaxies. This is explained by either speculating that\nFGs are failed groups that formed without bright satellite galaxies and did not\nsuffer any major merger, or by suggesting that FGs are very old systems that\nhad enough time to exhaust their bright satellite galaxies through multiple\nmajor mergers. Since major mergers leave signatures in the stellar populations\nof the resulting galaxy, we study the stellar population parameters of the\nbrightest central galaxies (BCGs) of FGs as a benchmark against which the\nformation and evolution scenarios of FGs can be compared. We present long-slit\nspectroscopic observations along different axes of NGC 6482 and NGC 7556, which\nare the BCGs of two nearby FGs.

Nevertheless, in this framework, the preferred cosmological parameters\nmay differ from probe to probe, from experiment to experiment. This is the well\nknown case of the tension between CMB and Sunyaev Zel'dovich (SZ) galaxy\nclusters (GC) from Planck.

HD 169142 is a very young Herbig Ae-Be\nstar surrounded by a pre-transitional disk, composed of at least three rings.\nWhile claims of sub-stellar objects around this star have been made previously,\nfollow-up studies remain inconclusive.

The IR\nnon-stellar spectral energy distributions (SED) (up to 15 micron) of Sy\ngalaxies show a variety of shapes, and they are well reproduced with the\ntapered disk models of Efstathiou & Rowan-Robinson (1995).

The\ndiscussion is based on an analysis of spatial variations in the apparent\nmagnitude of features in the near-IR color-magnitude diagrams extracted from\nthe DENIS and 2MASS surveys. Sinusoidal brightness variations with a\npeak-to-peak amplitude of approximately 0.25 mag are detected as function of\nposition angle, for both AGB and RGB stars. This is naturally interpreted as\nthe result of distance variations, due to one side of the LMC plane being\ncloser to us than the opposite side. The best fitting geometric model of an\ninclined plane yields an inclination angle i = 34.7 +/- 6.2 degrees and\nline-of-nodes position angle Theta = 122.5 +/- 8.3 degrees. There is tentative\nevidence that the LMC disk plane may be warped.

We find that adoption of a higher metallicity ([Fe/H] ~ -1.2), as favored\nby the Carretta & Gratton metallicity scale, makes age a much more plausible\nsecond parameter candidate for this pair than is the case when a lower\nmetallicity ([Fe/H] ~ -1.5), closer to the Zinn & West scale, is adopted.\nHowever, while the different HB morphology of these two clusters can be\nreproduced by canonical HB models with [Fe/H] ~ -1.2 and an age difference of 2\nGyr, this explanation is not without difficulty.

A flatter halo core with $\\alpha <1$ exerts on\nthe satellites tidal compression in all directions, which prevents deposit of\nstripped satellite material in the core region. This makes the satellite orbits\ndecay from the radius where $\\alpha \\sim 1$ to the halo centre with no local\ntidal mass transfer and thus causes a rapid steepening of the inner profile to\n$\\alpha >1$. These tidal effects, the resultant steepening of the profile to a\ncusp, and the stability of this cusp to tandem mergers with compact satellites,\nare demonstrated using N-body simulations. The transition at $\\alpha \\sim 1$ is\nthen addressed using toy models in the limiting cases of impulse and adiabatic\napproximations and using tidal radii for satellites on radial and circular\norbits. In an associated paper we address the subsequent slow convergence from\neither side to an asymptotic stable cusp with $\\alpha \\gsim 1$. Our analysis\nthus implies that an inner cusp is enforced when small haloes are typically\nmore compact than larger haloes, as in the CDM scenario, such that enough\nsatellite material makes it intact into the inner halo and is deposited there.\nWe conclude that a necessary condition for maintaining a flat core, as\nindicated by observations, is that the inner regions of the CDM satellite\nhaloes be puffed up by about 50% such that when they merge into a bigger halo\nthey would be disrupted outside the halo core.

The total number of such anomalously high redshift SNe Ia will\nbe a useful test of high redshift star formation models. SN surveys of finite\nduration will, of course, miss the appearance of some images; we quantify this\nselection bias. Finally, we investigate how well the appearance of trailing\nimages can be predicted based on various amounts of available information on\nthe lensing event. Knowledge of the magnification factor for the leading image\nmakes it possible to predict the appearance of a trailing image relatively\naccurately if the lens redshift is also known.

The network has five input neurons, a\nhidden layer of five neurons and one output neuron. The five input variables\nfor the network are extracted by spectral analysis from the lightcurve\ndatapoints and are optimised for the identification of a single, symmetric,\nmicrolensing bump. The output of the network is the posterior probability of\nmicrolensing. The committee of neural networks successfully passes tests on\nnoisy data taken by the MACHO collaboration. When used to process 5000\nlightcurves on a typical tile towards the bulge, the network cleanly identifies\nthe single microlensing event.

In principle, these flux anomalies could arise from alternate\nsources such as absorption, scattering or scintillation by the interstellar\nmedium (ISM) of the lens galaxy, problems in the ellipsoidal macro models used\nto fit lens systems, or stellar microlensing. We apply several tests to the\ndata that appear to rule out these alternate explanations. First, the radio\nflux anomalies show no significant dependence on wavelength, as would be\nexpected for almost any propagation effect in the ISM or microlensing by the\nstars. Second, the flux anomaly distributions show the characteristic\ndemagnifications of the brightest saddle point relative to the other images\nexpected for low optical depth substructure, which cannot be mimicked by either\nthe ISM or problems in the macro models. Microlensing by stars also cannot\nreproduce the suppression of the bright saddle points if the radio source sizes\nare consistent with the Compton limit for their angular sizes. Third, while it\nis possible to change the smooth lens models to fit the flux anomalies in some\nsystems, we can rule out the necessary changes in all systems where we have\nadditional lens constraints to check the models.

We find that, in clouds that are initially magnetically\nsubcritical, supersonic turbulence can speed up star formation, through\nenhanced ambipolar diffusion in shocks. The speedup overcomes a major objection\nto the standard scenario of low-mass star formation involving ambipolar\ndiffusion, since the diffusion time scale at the average density of a molecular\ncloud is typically longer than the cloud life time.

The clusters\nhave similar temperatures (kT=2.65, 2.53 and 2.58 keV), and similar redshifts\n(0.04 < z < 0.06). We trace the surface brightness, temperature, entropy and\nintegrated mass profiles up to 0.5 (0.35 for MKW9) of the virial radius\n(r_200).

The\nc_200 parameters of these clusters, and other values from the literature, are\nfully consistent with the c_200 - M_200 relation derived from simulations. The\ndispersion in scaled entropy profiles is small, implying self-similarity down\nto low mass (kT ~2 keV), and is reduced by 30-40% (to ~20%) if we use the\nempirical relation S \\propto T^0.65 instead of the standard self-similar\nrelation, S \\propto T.

The first two epochs\nshow a resolved but compact radio source which becomes optically thin at\nfrequencies higher than 5 GHz. The later images show a large (120-350 mas)\noval-shaped or double ring remnant. The radio spectrum combined with the high\nbrightness temperature indicates that the emission is synchrotron, while the\nmorphology suggests that this is powered by a decelerating shock moving through\ndense circumstellar material produced by a strong stellar wind. The radio\nimages of CI Cam are equally well fit by an expanding ellipsoid or two\nexpanding rings.

One of the major\nuncertainties is the exact chemical state of the star forming gas and its\ninfluence on the dynamical evolution. Most simulations of star forming clusters\nuse an isothermal equation of state (EOS). However, theoretical predictions and\nobservations suggest that the effective polytropic exponent gamma in the EOS\nvaries with density.\n  We address these issues and study the effect of a piecewise polytropic EOS on\nthe formation of stellar clusters in turbulent, self-gravitating molecular\nclouds using three-dimensional, smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations. To\napproximate the results of published predictions of the thermal behavior of\ncollapsing clouds, we increase the polytropic exponent gamma from 0.7 to 1.1 at\nsome chosen density n_c, which we vary. The change of thermodynamic state at\nn_c selects a characteristic mass scale for fragmentation M_ch, which we relate\nto the peak of the observed IMF. Our investigation generally supports the idea\nthat the distribution of stellar masses depends mainly on the thermodynamic\nstate of the star-forming gas. The thermodynamic state of interstellar gas is a\nresult of the balance between heating and cooling processes, which in turn are\ndetermined by fundamental atomic and molecular physics and by chemical\nabundances.

Abstract: In the present paper we raise the question whether initial cosmological\nsingularity can be proved from the cosmological tests.

On the other hand the latest quantum gravity\napplications to cosmology suggest of possibility of avoiding the singularity\nand replace it with the bounce. The distant type Ia supernovae data are used to\nconstraints on bouncing evolutional scenario where square of the Hubble\nfunction $H^2$ is given by formulae\n$H^2=H^2_0[\\Omega_{m,0}(1+z)^{m}-\\Omega_{n,0}(1+z)^{n}]$, where $\\Omega_{m,0},\n\\Omega_{n,0}>0$ are density parameters and $n>m>0$. We show that the on the\nbase of the SNIa data standard bouncing models can be ruled out on the\n$4\\sigma$ confidence level. If we add the cosmological constant to the standard\nbouncing model then we obtain as the best-fit that the parameter $\\Omega_{n,0}$\nis equal zero which means that the SNIa data do not support the bouncing term\nin the model.

Here, we examine some of the fundamental simplifying assumptions\nbehind this model and generalise it in several important ways. The model\npredicts that the ionized regions attain a well-defined characteristic size R_c\nthat ranges from R_c~1 Mpc in the early phases to R_c>10 Mpc in the late\nphases. We show that R_c is determined primarily by the bias of the galaxies\ndriving reionization; hence measurements of this scale constrain a fundamental\nproperty of the first galaxies. The variance around R_c, on the other hand, is\ndetermined primarily by the underlying matter power spectrum. We then show that\nincreasing the ionizing efficiency of massive galaxies shifts R_c to\nsignificantly larger scales and decreases the importance of recombinations.\nThese differences can be observed with forthcoming redshifted 21 cm surveys\n(increasing the brightness temperature fluctuations by up to a factor of two on\nlarge scales) and with measurements of small-scale anisotropies in the cosmic\nmicrowave background. Finally, we show that stochastic fluctuations in the\ngalaxy population only broaden the bubble size distribution significantly if\nmassive galaxies are responsible for most of the ionizing photons.

(ii) Using the combined data for PNs brighter than 26.2, we have\nidentified a subpopulation of PNs which is azimuthally unmixed and\nkinematically peculiar, and which thus neither traces the distribution of all\nstars nor can it be in dynamical equilibrium with the galaxy potential.

The most popular progenitor model invokes the merger of either double\nneutron star (DNS) binaries or neutron star-black hole (NS-BH) systems. Such\nevents are strong sources of gravitational-waves (GWs) and might be detected by\nground-based GW observatories. In this work we combine the census of SHB\nobservations with refined theoretical analysis to perform a critical evaluation\nof the compact binary model. We then explore the implications for GW detection\nof these events. Beginning from the measured star-formation rate through cosmic\ntime, we consider what intrinsic luminosity and lifetime distributions can\nreproduce the known SHB redshifts and luminosities as well as the peak flux\ndistribution of the large BATSE SHB sample. We find that: (1) The typical\nprogenitor lifetime is long. Assuming lognormal lifetime distribution the\ntypical lifetime is >4[1] Gyr (2[3]\\sigma c.l.). If the lifetime distribution\nis a power-law with index \\eta then \\eta>-0.5 [-1] (2[3] \\sigma c.l.). This\nresult is difficult to reconcile with the properties of the observed galactic\nDNS population, suggesting that if SHBs do result from DNS mergers then the\nobserved galactic binaries do not represent the cosmic one. (2) We find that\nthe local rate of SHBs is larger than 10Gpc^-3/yr and may be higher by several\norders of magnitude, significantly above previous estimates. (3) Assuming that\nSHBs do result from compact binaries, our predictions for the LIGO and VIRGO\nevent rates are encouraging: The chance for detection by current facilities is\nnot negligible, while a coincident detection of GW and electromagnetic\nradiation from an SHB is guaranteed for next-generation observatories. \n\n"}

We want to investigate whether\nsatellite accretions indeed drive the growth of bulges, and whether they are\nconsistent with global scaling relations of bulges and discs. We perform N-body\nmodels of the accretion of satellites onto disc galaxies. A Tully-Fisher (M\n\\propto V_{rot}^ {alpha_TF}) scaling between primary and satellite ensures that\ndensity ratios, critical to the outcome of the accretion, are realistic. We\ncarry out a full structural, kinematic and dynamical analysis of the evolution\nof the bulge mass, bulge central concentration, and bulge-to-disc scaling\nrelations. The remnants of the accretion have bulge-disc structure. Both the\nbulge-to-disc ratio (B/D) and the Sersic index (n) of the remnant bulge\nincrease as a result of the accretion, with moderate final bulge Sersic\nindices: n = 1.0 to 1.9.

Some studies have required compact dark matter halos (constant\nM/L ratio) in order to reconcile gravitational lenses with the HST/WMAP value\nof the Hubble constant (72 +/- 8 km/s /Mpc and 72 +/- 5 km/s /Mpc,\nrespectively). This is in direct contradiction with X-ray, stellar dynamical,\nand weak lensing studies, which all point towards extended halos and isothermal\ndensity profiles. In this work, we examine an up-to-date sample of 13 lensing\ngalaxies resulting in a data set consisting of 21 time delays. We select\nsystems in which there is a single primary lensing galaxy (e.g. excluding\nsystems undergoing mergers). Analysis is performed using analytic models based\nupon a powerlaw density profile (rho \\propto r^-n) of which the isothermal\nprofile is a special case (n = 2). This yields a value of n = 2.11+/-0.12\n(3sigma) for the mean profile when modeling with a prior on the Hubble\nconstant, which is only consistent with isothermality within 3 sigma. Note that\nthis is a formal error from our calculations, and does not include the impact\nof sample selection or simplifications in the lens modeling.

Neither changing the efficiency of\nmetal dispersal by two orders of magnitude, nor drastically changing the\napproximations in our semi-analytical model can affect these result. Thus, if\nthey have sufficiently long lifetimes, a significant number of stars formed in\ninitially primordial star clusters should be found in the nearby Galactic halo\nregardless of the specifics of metal-free star formation. Observations of metal\nabundances in Galactic halo stars should be taken as directly constraining the\nproperties of primordial stars, and the lack of metal-free halo stars today\nshould be taken as strongly suggesting a 0.8 solar mass lower limit on the\nprimordial initial mass function. \n\n"}

Abstract: We revisit the longstanding question of whether first brightest cluster\ngalaxies are statistically drawn from the same distribution as other cluster\ngalaxies or are \"special\", using the new non-parametric, empirically based\nmodel presented in Vale&Ostriker (2006) for associating galaxy luminosity with\nhalo/subhalo masses. We introduce scatter in galaxy luminosity at fixed halo\nmass into this model, building a conditional luminosity function (CLF) by\nconsidering two possible models: a simple lognormal and a model based on the\ndistribution of concentration in haloes of a given mass. We show that this\nmodel naturally allows an identification of halo/subhalo systems with groups\nand clusters of galaxies, giving rise to a clear central/satellite galaxy\ndistinction.\n  We then use these results to build up the dependence of brightest cluster\ngalaxy (BCG) magnitudes on cluster luminosity, focusing on two statistical\nindicators, the dispersion in BCG magnitude and the magnitude difference\nbetween first and second brightest galaxies. We compare our results with two\nsimple models for BCGs: a statistical hypothesis that the BCGs are drawn from a\nuniversal distribution, and a cannibalism scenario merging two galaxies from\nthis distribution. The statistical model is known to fail from work as far back\nas Tremaine&Richstone (1977). We show that neither the statistical model nor\nthe simplest possibility of cannibalism provide a good match for observations.\nOur CLF models both give similar results, in good agreement with observations.\nSpecifically, we find <m_1> between -25 and -25.5 in the K-band,\nsigma(m_1)~0.25 and <Delta_12> between 0.6 and 0.8, for cluster luminosities in\nthe range of 10^12 to 10^13 h^-2 L_sun. \n\n"}

It has been suggested that these planets are in a\nresonance involving persistent misalignment and synchronous precession of their\nspin and orbital angular momenta, a Cassini state, and that the attendant tidal\nheating inflates the planet. We argue against this. Using explicit tidal\nintegrations, we show that although an oblique Cassini state can dissipate many\ntimes the rotational energy of the planet, the rate of dissipation must be much\nless than hypothesized. Dissipation causes the planetary spin to lie at an\nangle to the plane containing the orbital and total angular momenta. If\ndissipation is too rapid, this angle becomes so large that Cassini equilibrium\nis lost. A separate consideration limits the total energy that can be extracted\nfrom the orbit. The source of the torque on the orbit, either an oblique parent\nstar or an inclined third body, aligns with the orbit as it absorbs the angular\nmomentum shed by the planet. Alignment removes the orbital precession required\nby the Cassini state. In combination with observational bounds on the mass and\nsemimajor axis of a possible second planet and with bounds on the stellar\nrotation and obliquity, these constraints make it very unlikely that obliquity\ntides can be the explanation for inflated hot Jupiters, especially HD 209458b. \n\n"}

Statistical comparisons between\nmicrowave and X-ray maps can probe interesting astrophysical environments and\nprocesses, such as e.g. the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect in clusters of galaxies\nor the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. In order to test the diffuse,\nextragalactic X-ray background as probed by ROSAT, against the COBE DMR\nlarge-scale CMB structure, our analysis was performed in most detail in a ROSAT\nselected region of the sky (40 deg < b, 70 < l < 250 deg) in an X-ray energy\nrange with minimal Galactic structure and residual X-ray contamination.\nComparing to other regions of the sky and neighbouring energies and\nfrequencies, we find indication for a positive Galactic correlation on large\nscales. Removing a quadrupole term on a sky map with a Galactic cutout or\nrelated gradients in the selected regions leaves no correlations above a\n1-sigma level on smaller angular scales. We conclude that there is no\nsignificant extragalactic correlation on scales for which the combined data are\nsensitive (7 deg - 40 deg) and that Galactic correlation is significant only on\nangular scales of the order of the quadrupole. In the context of removing large\nangular scale gradients we give results on best fit X-ray dipoles from various\nROSAT data and discuss these with respect to the difficulty of finding a\ncosmological dipole. The lowest correlation upper limits we can place are about\n15 % of COBE CMB fluctuations and about 10 % of the ROSAT extragalactic XRB\nfluctuations.

Abstract: We have studied using the KLUN sample of 5171 spiral galaxies having\nTully-Fisher distance moduli, the average radial space distribution of galaxies\nout to a distance of about 200 Mpc (for H_0=50 km/s/Mpc). One motivation came\nfrom the current debate on the fractal dimension D and maximum scale of\nfractality. To study this question, we used a new method based on photometric\nTF distances, independent of redshift, to construct the number density\ndistribution. Our main results are:\n  (1) While scattered below about 20 Mpc, at larger distances the radial\ndistribution starts to follow, in terms of distance modulus mu_TF, the law log\nN = 0.46 mu + const., using diameter TF relation, and log N = 0.40 mu + const.\nfor magnitudes. These are the predictions based on fractal dimensions 2.3 and\n2.0, respectively. These radial density gradients are valid up to the limits of\nKLUN, or about 200 Mpc.\n  (2) We have tried to understand the derived radial density behaviour as a\nresult of some bias in KLUN or our analysis, however, without success.\nNumerical simulations have shown that the method itself works. If the density\nlaw is caused by incompleteness in the diameter limited KLUN sample, then the\nincompleteness should start at widely different angular diameters d_25 for\ndifferent values of rotation parameter log V_M, which would be quite\nunexpected.\n  (3) If correlation studies favoring long scale fractality (200 Mpc or more)\nand D ~ 2 are correct, the position of our Galaxy would be close to average in\nthe Universe, with the galaxy density decreasing around us according to the\nexpected law. \n\n"}

We study the evolution of strain in\nthe crust, the initiation of starquakes, and possible consequences for magnetic\nfield and torque evolution. Crust cracking occurs as equatorial material shears\nunder the compressive forces arising from the star's decreasing circumference,\nand matter moves to higher latitudes along a fault inclined to the equator.

A13, 1265 (1998)), in which a model of non-local\nQuantum Electrodynamics was formulated through the principle of gauge\ninvariance. In this paper we show that the Cosmic Microwave Background\nRadiation is capable of making every particle of the universe (except those\nwhich are not acted upon by an electromagnetic field) follow this arrow of\ntime. \n\n"}
