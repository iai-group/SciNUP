The conductance function\n$c_{xy}$ weights the edges, which are then interpreted as conductors of\npossibly varying strengths. The Dirichlet energy form $\\mathcal E$ produces a\nHilbert space structure (which we call the energy space ${\\mathcal H}_{\\mathcal\nE}$) on the space of functions of finite energy.\n  We use the reproducing kernel $\\{v_x\\}$ constructed in \\cite{DGG} to analyze\nthe effective resistance $R$, which is a natural metric for such a network. It\nis known that when $(G,c)$ supports nonconstant harmonic functions of finite\nenergy, the effective resistance metric is not unique. The two most natural\nchoices for $R(x,y)$ are the ``free resistance'' $R^F$, and the ``wired\nresistance'' $R^W$. We define $R^F$ and $R^W$ in terms of the functions $v_x$\n(and certain projections of them). This provides a way to express $R^F$ and\n$R^W$ as norms of certain operators, and explain $R^F \\neq R^W$ in terms of\nNeumann vs. Dirichlet boundary conditions. We show that the metric space\n$(G,R^F)$ embeds isometrically into ${\\mathcal H}_{\\mathcal E}$, and the metric\nspace $(G,R^W)$ embeds isometrically into the closure of the space of finitely\nsupported functions; a subspace of ${\\mathcal H}_{\\mathcal E}$.\n  Typically, $R^F$ and $R^W$ are computed as limits of restrictions to finite\nsubnetworks. A third formulation $R^{tr}$ is given in terms of the trace of the\nDirichlet form $\\mathcal E$ to finite subnetworks. A probabilistic approach\nshows that in the limit, $R^{tr}$ coincides with $R^F$. This suggests a\ncomparison between the probabilistic interpretations of $R^F$ vs. $R^W$. \n\n"}

The universal unitary\nextension can be seen as a unitary coupling of four unitary operators (two\nbilateral shift operators together with two unitary operators coming from the\nproblem data) which has special geometric structure. We use this special\ngeometric structure to obtain an inverse theorem (Theorem 8.4 as well as\nTheorem 9.3) which characterizes the coefficient matrices for a Redheffer\nlinear-fractional map arising in this way from a lifting problem. When\nexpressed in terms of Hellinger-space functional models (Theorem 10.3), these\nresults lead to generalizations of classical results of Arov and to\ncharacterizations of the coefficient matrix-measures of the lifting problem in\nterms of the density properties of the corresponding model spaces. The main\ntool is the formalism of unitary scattering systems developed in [18], [45]. \n\n"}

In this paper we examine\nspanners of general graphs that are tolerant to vertex failures, and\nsignificantly improve their dependence on the number of faults $r$, for all\nstretch bounds.\n  For stretch $k \\geq 3$ we design a simple transformation that converts every\n$k$-spanner construction with at most $f(n)$ edges into an $r$-fault-tolerant\n$k$-spanner construction with at most $O(r^3 \\log n) \\cdot f(2n/r)$ edges.\nApplying this to standard greedy spanner constructions gives $r$-fault tolerant\n$k$-spanners with $\\tilde O(r^{2} n^{1+\\frac{2}{k+1}})$ edges. The previous\nconstruction by Chechik, Langberg, Peleg, and Roddity [STOC 2009] depends\nsimilarly on $n$ but exponentially on $r$ (approximately like $k^r$).\n  For the case $k=2$ and unit-length edges, an $O(r \\log n)$-approximation\nalgorithm is known from recent work of Dinitz and Krauthgamer [arXiv 2010],\nwhere several spanner results are obtained using a common approach of rounding\na natural flow-based linear programming relaxation.

In other words, there exists a\nshuffle of $k$-copies of $x$ which produces $x$. We are particularly interested\nin the case $k=2$, in which case we say $x$ is self-shuffling. This property of\ninfinite words is shown to be an intrinsic property of the word and not of its\nlanguage (set of factors). For instance, every aperiodic word contains a non\nself-shuffling word in its shift orbit closure. While the property of being\nself-shuffling is a relatively strong condition, many important words arising\nin the area of symbolic dynamics are verified to be self-shuffling. They\ninclude for instance the Thue-Morse word and all Sturmian words of intercept\n$0<\\rho <1$ (while those of intercept $\\rho=0$ are not self-shuffling). Our\ncharacterization of self-shuffling Sturmian words can be interpreted\narithmetically in terms of a dynamical embedding and defines an arithmetic\nprocess we call the {\\it stepping stone model}. One important feature of\nself-shuffling words stems from its morphic invariance, which provides a useful\ntool for showing that one word is not the morphic image of another. The notion\nof self-shuffling has other unexpected applications particularly in the area of\nsubstitutive dynamical systems.

Our main result states that,\nunder the additional assumption of (k + 1)- connectivity, such graphs have\nbounded pathwidth. In fact, they have pathwidth O(t^3 + tk^2). Moreover,\nexamples show that (k + 1)-connectivity is required for bounded pathwidth to\nhold. These results suggest the following general question: for which values of\nk and graphs H does every k-connected H-minor-free graph have bounded\npathwidth?

For a given total number of observations, we\nderive convergence rates as an explicit function of the problem difficulty. As\na special case, we answer a 15-year-old open question: we establish the\nconsistency of the classical set kernel [Haussler, 1999; Gartner et. al, 2002]\nin regression, and cover more recent kernels on distributions, including those\ndue to [Christmann and Steinwart, 2010]. \n\n"}

In this paper, we propose a novel\ngeometric understanding of amplitudes for a large class of theories. The key is\nto think of amplitudes as differential forms directly on kinematic space. We\nexplore this picture for a wide range of massless theories in general spacetime\ndimensions. For the bi-adjoint cubic scalar, we establish a direct connection\nbetween its \"scattering form\" and a classic polytope--the associahedron--known\nto mathematicians since the 1960's. We find an associahedron living naturally\nin kinematic space, and the tree amplitude is simply the \"canonical form\"\nassociated with this \"positive geometry\". Basic physical properties such as\nlocality, unitarity and novel \"soft\" limits are fully determined by the\ngeometry. Furthermore, the moduli space for the open string worldsheet has also\nlong been recognized as an associahedron. We show that the scattering equations\nact as a diffeomorphism between this old \"worldsheet associahedron\" and the new\n\"kinematic associahedron\", providing a geometric interpretation and novel\nderivation of the bi-adjoint CHY formula. We also find \"scattering forms\" on\nkinematic space for Yang-Mills and the Non-linear Sigma Model, which are dual\nto the color-dressed amplitudes despite having no explicit color factors. This\nis possible due to a remarkable fact--\"Color is Kinematics\"--whereby kinematic\nwedge products in the scattering forms satisfy the same Jacobi relations as\ncolor factors.

Our starting\npoint is the classical notion of an abelian group-valued \"flow\" on an abstract\ngraph (Tutte, 1954). Typing a linear lambda term may be naturally seen as\nconstructing a flow (on an embedded 3-valent graph with boundary) valued in a\nmore general algebraic structure consisting of a preordered set equipped with\nan \"implication\" operation and unit satisfying composition, identity, and unit\nlaws.

For example, we give a characterization of when the\nlocal flow relations (across vertices) may be categorically lifted to a global\nflow relation (across the boundary), proving that this holds just in case the\nunderlying map has the orientation of a lambda term.

In particular, our results guarantee that such polynomial\nevaluations have finite logarithmic energy and thus finite (non-microstates)\nfree entropy, which partially settles a conjecture of Charlesworth and\nShlyakhtenko [CS16].\n  We further provide a very general criterion that gives for weak\napproximations of measures having H\\\"older continuous cumulative distribution\nfunctions explicit rates of convergence in terms of the Kolmogorov distance.\n  Finally, we combine these results to study the asymptotic eigenvalue\ndistributions of polynomials in GUEs or matrices with more general Gibbs laws.\nFor Gibbs laws, this extends the corresponding result obtained in [GS09] from\nconvergence in distribution to convergence in Kolmogorov distance; in the GUE\ncase, we even provide explicit rates, which quantify results of [HT05,HST06] in\nterms of the Kolmogorov distance. \n\n"}
