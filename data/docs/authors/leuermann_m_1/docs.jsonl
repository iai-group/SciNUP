Due to interference between the standard and non-standard\namplitudes, sizeable effects are to be expected if the NSI parameters are close\nto their current upper limits. We derive approximate formulas for the relevant\noscillation probabilities including NSI, and show how the leading effects can\nbe understood intuitively even without any calculations. We will present a\nclassification of all possible NSI according to their impact on reactor and\nsuperbeam experiments, and it will turn out that these experiments are highly\ncomplementary in terms of their sensitivity to the non-standard parameters. The\nsecond part of the paper is devoted to detailed numerical simulations, which\nwill demonstrate how a standard oscillation fit of the mixing angle theta-13\nmay fail if experimental data is affected by NSI. We find that for some\nnon-standard terms, reactor and superbeam experiments would yield seemingly\nconflicting results, while in other cases, they may agree well with each other,\nbut the resulting value for theta-13 could be far from the true value. This\noffset may be so large that the true theta-13 is even ruled out erroneously.

Assuming the solar neutrino production rate was constant during the\nperiod of data collection, combined analysis of 168 extractions through Dec.\n2007 gives a capture rate of solar neutrinos with energy more than 233 keV of\n65.4 (+3.1)(-3.0) (stat) (+2.6)(-2.8) (syst) SNU.

The ratio of\nobserved to calculated rates in this experiment, combined with the measured\nrates in the three prior 51Cr neutrino-source experiments with Ga, is 0.87 +/-\n0.05.

Assuming the observed gamma-ray emission is produced by the decay\nof neutral pions from proton-proton interactions, the measurement of the\ntime-averaged spectral characteristics of blazars in the GeV energy band\nimposes upper limits on the time-averaged neutrino flux.

In most models, the dark matter interacts\nweakly, but the possibility of a dark matter particle with a large cross\nsection for elastic scattering with itself has been proposed in several\ncontexts. I study the consequences of such dark matter self-interactions for\nthe high-energy neutrino flux from annihilation within the Sun. The\nself-interaction may allow dark matter in the halo to be captured within the\nSun by scattering off of previously-captured dark matter within the Sun. This\neffect is not negligible in acceptable and accessible regions of parameter\nspace. Enhancements in the predicted high-energy neutrino flux from the Sun of\ntens to hundreds of percent can be realized in broad regions of parameter\nspace. Enhancements as large as factors of several hundred may be realized in\nextreme regions of the viable parameter space. Large enhancements require the\ndark matter annihilation cross section to be relatively small, sigma*v <~\n10^-27 cm^3/s. This phenomenology is interesting. First, self-capture is\nnegligible for the Earth, so dark matter self-interactions break the\ncorrespondence between the solar and terrestrial neutrino signals. Likewise,\nthe correspondence between indirect and direct detection limits on scattering\ncross sections on nuclei is broken by the self-interaction. These broken\ncorrespondences may evince strong dark matter self-interactions.

This disk forms powerful jets and consists of thin spiral\naccretion streams of a dense optically thick plasma surrounded by hot,\nmagnetized, optically thin corona, which emits most of the energy in hard\nX-rays.

Pushed by evidence of\nslow rotation prior to core-collapse, we focus on asphericities in neutrino\nemission and matter motions outside the protoneutron star.

With these\ncomputations, it is found that the waveforms exhibit more variety in contrast\nto the ones previously estimated by the ray-by-ray analysis (e.g., Kotake et\nal. (2007)). In addition to a positively growing feature, which was predicted\nto determine the total wave amplitudes predominantly, the waveforms are shown\nto exhibit large negative growth for some epochs during the growth of SASI.\nThese features are found to stem from the excess of neutrino emission in\nlateral directions, which can be precisely captured by the ray-tracing\ncalculation.

Such SMW\njets are assumed as initial conditions in some numerical simulations that\ndemonstrate that SMW jets can expel the rest of the collapsing star. The\noriginal fast narrow jets must deposit their energy inside the star via shock\nwaves, and form two hot bubbles that accelerate a much larger mass to form SMW\njets. To prevent the jets from penetrating through the still infalling gas and\nescape instead of forming the hot bubbles, the jets should encounter fresh\ninfalling gas. This condition is met if the jets' axis changes its direction.\nThe exact condition is derived. In addition, to maintain a small neutrino\ncooling the fast narrow jets must be shocked at a distance r>1000 km from the\ncore, such that most of the post-shock energy is in radiation, and temperature\nis not too high.

We focus here on a reflection-based\ninterpretation which interprets both features, as well as the large soft\nexcess, in terms of partially ionized reflection off the inner accretion disc.\nWe show that the two peculiar spectral features mentioned above can be\nreproduced by two relativistic emission lines due to Fe K and Fe L. The lines\nare produced in the inner accretion disc and independently yield consistent\ndisc parameters. We argue that the high L/K intensity ratio is broadly\nconsistent with expectations from an ionized accretion disc reflection,\nindicating that they belong to a single ionized reflection component. The\nspectral shape, X-ray flux, and variability properties are very similar in the\nXMM-Newton and Suzaku observations, performed about 5 years apart.

For 3\nrepresentative models, we also include long-term neutrino physics by means of a\nleakage scheme. Non- or only slowly rotating models show GW emission due to\nprompt and proto-neutron star convection, allowing the distinction between the\ntwo different nuclear EoS. For moderately or fast rotation rates models, we\nfind, in agreement with recent results, only a type I GW signature at core\nbounce. Models which are set up with an initial central angular velocity of >~\n2pi rad/s emit GWs due to the low T/|W| dynamical instability during the\npostbounce phase. Weak B-fields do not notably influence the dynamical\nevolution of the core and thus the GW emission. However, for strong initial\npoloidal B-fields (~1e12 G),flux-freezing and field winding leads to conditions\nwhere P_{mag}/P_{mat} ~ 1, causing the onset of a jet-like supernova explosion\nand hence the emission of a type IV GW signal. In contradiction to axisymmetric\nsimulations, we find evidence that nonaxisymmetric fluid modes can counteract\nor even suppress jet formation for models with strong initial toroidal\nB-fields.

The Hamiltonian structure of this theory is studied in all the details\nin the case of the spatially-flat FRW space-time, demonstrating many of the\nfeatures of the general theory. It is shown that, with some plausible\nassumptions, including the projectability of the lapse function, this model is\nconsistent. As a large class of such theories, the modified HL $F(R)$ gravity\nis introduced. The study of its ultraviolet properties shows that its $z=3$\nversion seems to be renormalizable in the same way as the original HL proposal.\nThe Hamiltonian analysis of the modified HL $F(R)$ gravity shows that it is in\ngeneral a consistent theory. The $F(R)$ gravity action is also studied in the\nfixed-gauge form, where the appearance of a scalar field is particularly\nillustrative. Then the spatially-flat FRW cosmology for this $F(R)$ gravity is\ninvestigated. It is shown that a special choice of parameters for this theory\nleads to the same equations of motion as in the case of traditional $F(R)$\ngravity. Nevertheless, the cosmological structure of the modified HL $F(R)$\ngravity turns out to be much richer than for its traditional counterpart.

We find that the preshock gas temperature is the\nprimary parameter that governs the cosmic ray (CR) acceleration efficiency and\nenergy spectrum, while the CR injection rate is a secondary parameter. For SNRs\nin the warm ISM, if the injection fraction is larger than 10^{-4}, the DSA is\nefficient enough to convert more than 20 % of the SN explosion energy into CRs\nand the accelerated CR spectrum exhibits a concave curvature flattening to\nE^{-1.6}.

Here we\ninvestigate whether electrons can be accelerated to energies such that they\nradiate synchrotron photons with energy up to about 10 GeV in this particular\nscenario. We do this using two methods: (i) we check if these electrons can be\nconfined to the shock front; and (ii) we calculate radiative losses while they\nare being accelerated. We find that these electrons remain confined to the\nshock front, as long as the upstream magnetic field is >~ 10 micro-Gauss, and\ndon't suffer substantial radiative losses, the only condition required is that\nthe external reverse shock emission be not too bright: peak flux less than 1 Jy\nin order to produce photons of 100 MeV, and less than ~100 mJy for producing\n1-GeV photons.

A relativistic jet is capable of accelerating lower-energy heavy\nseed cosmic rays (CRs) to UHECRs on timescales comparable to the time it takes\nthe jet to pierce the large gaseous cloud.

The radio frequency spectrum and angular distribution depend on\nthe shower development, so are sensitive to the interaction cross sections. At\nenergies above about 10^{16} eV (in ice), the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM)\neffect significantly reduces the cross sections for the two dominant\nelectromagnetic interactions: bremsstrahlung and pair production. At higher\nenergies, above about 10^{20} eV, the photonuclear cross section becomes larger\nthan that for pair production, and direct pair production and electronuclear\ninteractions become dominant over bremsstrahlung. The electron interaction\nlength reaches a maximum around 10^{21} eV, and then decreases slowly as the\nelectron energy increases further. In this regime, the growth in the photon\ncross section and electron energy loss moderates the rise in nu_e shower\nlength, which rises from ~10 m at 10^{16} eV to ~50 m at 10^{19} eV and ~100 m\nat 10^{20} eV, but only to ~1 km at 10^{24} eV.

There are several accretion disc\nmodels in the literature that account for this aspect. However, none is\ndesigned to simultaneously explain the presence of powerful jets detected\nduring these states. A new quasi-keplerian hot accretion disc solution, a Jet\nEmitting disc (JED hereafter), which is part of a global disc-jet MHD structure\nproducing stationary super-alfv\\'enic ejection, is investigated here. Its\nradiative and energetic properties are then compared to the observational\nconstraints found in Cygnus X-1. We solve the disc energy equation by balancing\nthe local heating term with advection and cooling by synchrotron,\nbremsstrahlung and Comptonization processes. The heating term, disc density,\naccretion velocity and magnetic field amplitude were taken from published\nself-similar models of accretion-ejection structures. Both optically thin and\nthick regimes are considered in a one temperature gas supported disc. Three\nbranches of solutions are found possible at a given radius but we investigate\nonly the hot, optically thin and geometrically slim solutions. These solutions\ngive simultaneously, and in a consistent way, the radiative and energetics\nproperties of the disc-jet system. They are able to very well reproduce the\naccretion-ejection properties of Cygnus X-1, namely its X-ray spectral\nemission, jet power and jet velocity. About half of the released accretion\npower is used to produce two mildly relativistic (v/c~0.5) jets and for a\nluminosity of the order of 1\\% of the Eddington luminosity, the JED temperature\nand optical depth are close to that observed in the hard state Cygnus X-1.

We\npresent a simple model for estimating the conditions at shock breakout in a\nwind based on the general observable quantities in the X-ray flash lightcurve:\nthe total energy E_X, and the diffusion time after the peak, t_diff. We base\nthe derivation on the self-similar solution for the forward-reverse shock\nstructure expected for an ejecta plowing through a pre-existing wind at large\ndistances from the progenitor's surface.

The\ndistribution of dusty gas should be also anisotropic due to the influence of\nthe anisotropic disk radiation, i.e. the dust in the face-on direction of an\naccretion disk can be blown out relatively more easily, whereas the dust can\nsurvive in the edge-on direction.

The\nsimplest and most popular model is Synchrotron, Self-Compton (SSC) emission\nproduced by internal shocks inside an ultra-relativistic jet. However, recent\nobservations of a delayed high energy component have encouraged alternative\nmodels. Here we use a recently developed formulation of relativistic shocks to\nsimulate GRBs. It takes into account the evolution of quantities such as\ndensities of colliding shells, electric and magnetic fields. We also extend the\nprevious formulation by considering a precessing external magnetic field. These\nsimulations are very realistic and present significant improvement with respect\nto previous phenomenological GRB simulations. They reproduce light curves of\nseparated peaks of real GRBs and variety of observed spectral slopes at E >\nE_{peak}. The high energy emission can be explained by synchrotron emission and\na subdominant contribution from inverse Compton. We also suggest an explanation\nfor the extended tail emission observed by the Fermi-LAT instrument and relate\nit to the screening of the magnetic field and/or trapping of accelerated\nelectrons in the electromagnetic energy structure of the plasma in the shock\nfront. Spectral slopes of simulated bursts at E << E_{peak} are consistent with\ntheoretical prediction and at E < E_{peak} can be flatter if the spectrum of\nelectrons is roughly flat or has a shallow slope. The observed flat spectra at\nsoft gamma-ray and hard x-ray bands is the evidence that there is a significant\ncontribution at $E < E_{peak}$ from lower Lorentz factor wing of electrons\ndistribution which have a roughly random acceleration rather than being\nthermal. This means that the state of matter in the jet at the time of ejection\nis most probably nonthermal and electrons have a shallow spectrum at low\nenergies.(abbreviated) \n\n"}

Methods: Our sample comprises 32 GRBs with measured redshift that were\nobserved by GBM until August 2010. 28 of them belong to the long-duration\npopulation and 4 events were classified as short/hard bursts. For all of these\nevents we derive, where possible, the intrinsic peak energy in the $\\nu\nF_{\\nu}$ spectrum (\\eprest), the duration in the rest-frame, defined as the\ntime in which 90% of the burst fluence was observed (\\tninetyrest) and the\nisotropic equivalent bolometric energy (\\eiso). Results: The distribution of\n\\eprest has mean and median values of 1.1 MeV and 750 keV, respectively. A\nlog-normal fit to the sample of long bursts peaks at ~800 keV.

The orbital parameters indicate it has a very low\nmass function, and therefore a companion mass much lower than usually expected\nfor such a mildly recycled pulsar. In addition we present polarisation profiles\nfor all 12 MSPs discovered in the HTRU survey to date.

Their polarisation profiles can be\nhighly complex, and although the observed position angles often do not obey the\nrotating vector model, we present several examples of those that do. We\nspeculate that the emission heights of MSPs are a substantial fraction of the\nlight cylinder radius in order to explain broad emission profiles, which then\nnaturally leads to a large number of cases where emission from both poles is\nobserved. \n\n"}

We argue that any infalling matter above a few per\ncent of the hole's mass is ejected as a result of the plunge in opacity at\ntemperatures below a few thousand degrees K, corresponding to the Hayashi\ntrack. The speed of ejection of this matter, compared to the velocity\ndispersion (sigma) of the host galaxy's core, determines whether the ejected\nmatter is lost forever or returns eventually to rejoin the envelope, from which\nit can be ultimately accreted. The threshold between matter recycling and\npermanent loss defines a relationship between the maximum black hole mass and\nsigma that resembles the empirical M_BH-sigma relation. \n\n"}

RX J0852.0-4622, also\nknown as Vela Junior, is one of the few (4) shell-type SNRs resolved at Very\nHigh Energies (VHE; E > 100 GeV). It is one of the largest known VHE sources (~\n1.0 deg radius) and its flux level is comparable to the flux level of the Crab\nNebula in the same energy band. These characteristics allow for a detailed\nanalysis, shedding further light on the high-energy processes taking place in\nthe remnant. In this document we present further details on the spatial and\nspectral morphology derived with an extended data set.

Most of the work on the earliest enrichment was carried out\nassuming that the first stars were extremely massive and that the associated\nsupernovae were unusually energetic, enough to completely unbind the baryons in\nthe host cosmic minihalo and disperse the synthesized metals into the\nintergalactic medium. Recent work, however, suggests that the first stars may\nin fact have been somewhat less massive, with a characteristic mass scale of a\nfew tens of solar masses. We present a cosmological simulation following the\ntransport of the metals synthesized in a Population III supernova assuming that\nit had an energy of 1e51 ergs, compatible with standard Type II supernovae. A\nyoung supernova remnant is inserted in the first star's relic HII region in the\nfree expansion phase and is followed for 40 Myr employing adaptive mesh\nrefinement and Lagrangian tracer particle techniques. The supernova remnant\nremains partially trapped within the minihalo and the thin snowplow shell\ndevelops pronounced instability and fingering.

The presence of viscosity is generally\nregarded as the condition for such transfer to happen. In this paper, we show\nhow the orbital evolution can cause a persistent torque between the binary\ncomponents, even for inviscid bodies. This preferentially occurs at the final\nstage of coalescence of compact binaries, when the orbit shrinks successively\nby gravitational waves and plunging on a timescale shorter than the viscous\ntimescale. The total orbital energy transferred to the secondary by this torque\nis ~0.01 of its binding energy. We further show that this persistent torque\ninduces a differentially rotating quadrupole perturbation. Specializing to the\ncase of a secondary neutron star, we find that this non equilibrium state has\nan associated free energy of 10^47-10^48 erg, just prior to coalescence. This\nenergy is likely stored in internal fluid motions, with a sizable amount of\ndifferential rotation. By tapping this free energy reservoir, a preexisting\nweak magnetic field could be amplified up to a strength of ~10^15 Gauss. Such a\ndynamically driven tidal torque can thus recycle an old neutron star into a\nhighly magnetized neutron star, with possible observational consequences at\nmerger. \n\n"}

Not simply the scaled-down versions of rich clusters\nfollowing self-similar relations, galaxy groups are ideal systems to study\nbaryon physics, which is important for both cluster cosmology and galaxy\nformation. We review the recent observational results on the hot gas in galaxy\ngroups. The first part of the paper is on the scaling relations, including\nX-ray luminosity, entropy, gas fraction, baryon fraction and metal abundance.\nCompared to clusters, groups have a lower fraction of hot gas around the center\n(e.g., r < r_2500), but may have a comparable gas fraction at large radii\n(e.g., r_2500 < r < r_500). Better constraints on the group gas and baryon\nfractions require sample studies with different selection functions and deep\nobservations at r > r_500 regions. The hot gas in groups is also iron poor at\nlarge radii (0.3 r_500 - 0.7 r_500). The iron content of the hot gas within the\ncentral regions (r < 0.3 r_500) correlates with the group mass, in contrast to\nthe trend of the stellar mass fraction. It remains to be seen where the missing\niron in low-mass groups is. In the second part, we discuss several aspects of\nX-ray cool cores in galaxy groups, including their difference from cluster cool\ncores, radio AGN heating in groups and the cold gas in group cool cores.\nBecause of the vulnerability of the group cool cores to radio AGN heating and\nthe weak heat conduction in groups, group cool cores are important systems to\ntest the AGN feedback models and the multiphase cool core models.

The parameter space for a significant\ncomponent of cosmological reionization to be sourced by X-rays is limited by a\nfew observations. We revisit the unresolved soft X-ray background constraint\nand show that it significantly limits the contribution to reionization from\nseveral potential sources: X-rays from X-ray binaries, from Compton scattering\noff supernovae-accelerated electrons, and from the annihilation of dark matter\nparticles. We discuss the additional limits on high-redshift X-ray production\nfrom (1) z~3 measurements of metal absorption lines, (2) the consensus that\nhelium reionization was ending at z~3, and (3) measurements of the\nintergalactic medium's thermal history.

In addition, we show that the late reionization of helium makes it\ndifficult to also ionize the hydrogen at z>6 with a single source population\n(such as quasars) and that it likely requires the spectrum of ionizing\nemissions to soften with increasing redshift.

The detection of gamma rays from star-forming galaxies by the Fermi\nLarge Area Telescope (LAT) has allowed the determination of a functional\nrelationship between star formation rate and gamma-ray luminosity (Ackermann\net. al. 2012). Since star formation is known to scale with total infrared\n(8-1000 micrometers) and radio (1.4 GHz) luminosity, the observed infrared and\nradio emission from a star-forming galaxy can be used to quantitatively infer\nthe galaxy's gamma-ray luminosity. Similarly, star forming galaxies within\ngalaxy clusters allow us to derive lower limits on the gamma-ray emission from\nclusters, which have not yet been conclusively detected in gamma rays. In this\nstudy we apply the relationships between gamma-ray luminosity and radio and IR\nluminosities derived in Ackermann et. al. 2012 to a sample of galaxy clusters\nfrom Ackermann et. al. 2010 in order to place lower limits on the gamma-ray\nemission associated with star formation in galaxy clusters.

Unlike other\nGalactic Type Ia supernova remnants such as Tycho and SN 1006, and SNR\n0509-67.5 in the Large Magellanic Cloud, Kepler shows evidence for a strong\ncircumstellar interaction. A bowshock structure in the north is thought to\noriginate from the motion of a mass-losing system through the interstellar\nmedium prior to the supernova. We present results of hydrodynamical and\nspectral modeling aimed at constraining the circumstellar environment of the\nsystem and the amount of 56Ni produced in the explosion. Using models that\ncontain either 0.3 M_sun (subenergetic) or 1 M_sun (energetic) of 56Ni, we\nsimulate the interaction between supernova Ia ejecta and various circumstellar\ndensity models. Based on dynamical considerations alone, we find that the\nsubenergetic models favor a distance to the SNR of < 6.4 kpc, while the model\nthat produces 1 M_sun of 56Ni requires a distance to the SNR of > 7 kpc. The\nX-ray spectrum is consistent with an explosion that produced ~ 1 M_sun of 56Ni,\nruling out the subenergetic models, and suggesting that Kepler's SNR was a SN\n1991T-like event. Additionally, the X-ray spectrum rules out a pure 1/r^2 wind\nprofile expected from isotropic mass loss up to the time of the supernova.\nIntroducing a small cavity around the progenitor system results in modeled\nX-ray spectra that are consistent with the observed spectrum.

We explore the possibility that the radio halo is due\nto synchrotron emission of secondary electrons generated via p-p collisions in\nthe intra-cluster-medium (ICM). First we investigate the case of pure secondary\nmodels. We use the observed spatial distribution of the halo's radio brightness\nto constrain the amount of cosmic rays (CRs) and their spatial distribution in\nthe cluster that are required by the model. Under the canonical assumption that\nthe spectrum of CRs is a power-law in momentum and that the spectrum of\nsecondaries is stationary, we find that the combination of the steep spectrum\nof CRs necessary to explain the spectrum of the halo and their very broad\nspatial distribution (and large energy density) result in a gamma-ray emission\nin excess of present limits, unless the cluster magnetic field is sufficiently\nlarge.

{"id": "1210.1041", "contents": "Title: Magnetic Penrose Process and Blanford-Zanejk mechanism: A clarification Abstract: The Penrose process (PP) is an ingenious mechanism of extracting rotational\nenergy from a rotating black hole, however it was soon realized that it was not\nvery efficient for its astrophysical applications for powering the central\nengine of quasars and AGNs. The situation however changed dramatically in the\npresence of magnetic field produced by the accretion disk surrounding the hole\nin the equatorial plane. In 1985, Wagh, Dhurandhar and Dadhich had for the\nfirst time considered the magnetic Penrose process (MPP) in which the magnetic\nfield could now provide the energy required for a fragment to ride on negative\nenergy orbit thereby overcoming the stringent velocity constraint of the\noriginal PP. Thus MPP turned very efficient and so much so that efficiency\ncould now even exceed 100 percent. They had in principle established revival of\nPP for astrophysical applications in powering the high energy sources. MPP is\nhowever similar to the earlier discovered and well known Blandford-Znajeck (BZ)\nmechanism in which the rotational energy of the hole is extracted out through a\npurely electromagnetic process. Though both the processes use magnetic field as\na device to extract rotational energy from the hole, yet their kernel is quite\ndifferent in spirit. For the former magnetic field provides the threshold\nenergy for particle to get onto negative energy orbit so that the other\nfragment goes out with enhanced energy while for the latter it generates an\nelectric potential difference between the equatorial plane and the polar\nregion, and it is the discharge of which that drives the energy flux out of the\nhole. In other words, MPP is still rooted in the spacetime geometry while BZ is\nessentially driven by electromagnetic interaction. \n\n"}

We find that the latter model fits the\nintegrated burst spectrum significantly better than the former, and that their\nrespective spectral parameters are dramatically different: when fit with a Band\nfunction only, the Epeak of the event is unusually soft for a short GRB, while\nadding a thermal component leads to more typical short GRB values. Our\ntime-resolved spectral analysis produces similar results. We argue here that\nthe two-component model is the preferred interpretation for GRB 120323A, based\non: (i) the values and evolution of the Band function parameters of the two\ncomponent scenario, which are more typical for a short GRB, and (ii) the\nappearance in the data of a significant hardness-intensity correlation,\ncommonly found in GRBs, when we employee two-component model fits; the\ncorrelation is non-existent in the Band-only fits.

The disc is initially threaded by a weak magnetic field\nwhere the magnetic pressure is significantly less than the kinetic pressure in\nthe disc. The viscosity and magnetic diffusivity are modelled by two \"alpha\"\nparameters, while the coronal region above the disc is treated using ideal MHD.\nThe initial magnetic field is taken to consist of three poloidal field loops\nthreading the disc. The motivation for this study is to understand the\nadvection of disc matter and magnetic field by the turbulent/diffusive disc. At\nearly times the innermost field loop twists and its field lines become open.\nThe twisting of the opened field lines leads to the formation of both an inner\ncollimated, magnetically-dominated jet, and at larger distances from the axis a\nmatter dominated uncollimated wind. For later times, the strength of the\nmagnetic field decreases owing to field reconnection and annihilation in the\ndisc. For the early times, we have derived from the simulations both the matter\naccretion speed in the disc and the accretion speed of the magnetic field. We\nshow that the derived matter accretion speed agrees approximately with the\npredictions of a model where the accretion speed is the sum of two terms, one\ndue to the disc's viscosity (which gives a radial outflow of angular momentum\nin the disc), and a second due to the twisted magnetic field at the disc's\nsurface (which gives a vertical outflow of angular momentum). For early times\nwe find that the magnetic contribution is roughly twice the viscous\ncontribution for the case where the alpha parameters are both equal to 0.1.

In addition\nto the four main intense and day-long flares detected by AGILE and Fermi-LAT\nbetween Sept. 2007 and Sept. 2012, we find evidence for week-long and less\nintense episodes of enhanced gamma-ray emission that we call \"waves\".\nStatistically significant \"waves\" show timescales of 1-2 weeks, and can occur\nby themselves or in association with shorter flares.

Instead, this torque-limited accretion model yields black\nholes and galaxies evolving on average along the observed scaling relations by\nrelying only on a fixed, 5% mass retention rate onto the black hole from the\nradius at which the accretion flow is fed. Feedback from the black hole may\n(and likely does) occur, but does not need to couple to galaxy-scale gas in\norder to regulate black hole growth.

The\nmean change in spectral index between these locations, which is independent of\ncalibration and flux-density scale errors and is therefore more accurately and\nrobustly measured, is -0.067 +/- 0.006. Our jet models associate the decrease\nin spectral index with a bulk deceleration of the flow from 0.8c to <0.5c.

More recently, it has been shown that\nthis signal is not confined to the innermost hundreds of parsecs of the Galaxy,\nbut instead extends to at least ~3 kpc from the Galactic Center. While the\nspectrum, intensity, and angular distribution of this signal is in good\nagreement with predictions from annihilating dark matter, it has also been\nsuggested that a population of unresolved millisecond pulsars could be\nresponsible for this excess GeV emission from the Inner Galaxy. In this paper,\nwe consider this later possibility in detail. Comparing the observed spectral\nshape of the Inner Galaxy's GeV excess to the spectrum measured from 37\nmillisecond pulsars by Fermi, we find that these sources exhibit a spectral\nshape that is much too soft at sub-GeV energies to accommodate this signal. We\nalso construct population models to describe the spatial distribution and\nluminosity function of the Milky Way's millisecond pulsars. After taking into\naccount constraints from the observed distribution of Fermi sources (including\nboth sources known to be millisecond pulsars, and unidentified sources which\ncould be pulsars), we find that millisecond pulsars can account for no more\nthan ~10% of the Inner Galaxy's GeV excess.

However, no GRB was detected in\nassociation with the SN. Here, the properties of SN2010ah are determined with\nhigher accuracy than previous studies through modelling. New Subaru telescope\nphotometry is presented. A bolometric light curve is constructed taking\nadvantage of the spectral similarity with SN1998bw. Radiation transport tools\nare used to reproduce the spectra and the light curve. The results thus\nobtained regarding ejecta mass, composition and kinetic energy are then used to\ncompute a synthetic light curve. This is in reasonable agreement with the early\nbolometric light curve of SN2010ah, but a high abundance of 56Ni at high\nvelocity is required to reproduce the early rise, while a dense inner core must\nbe used to reproduce the slow decline at late phases. The high-velocity 56Ni\ncannot have been located on our line of sight, which may be indirect evidence\nfor an off-axis, aspherical explosion. The main properties of SN2010ah are:\nejected mass ~ 3 Mo; kinetic energy ~10^52 erg, M(56Ni) ~ 0.25 Mo. The mass\nlocated at v >~ 0.1c is ~0.2 Mo. Although these values, in particular the\nkinetic energy, are quite large for a SN Ic, they are all smaller (especially\nthe ejecta mass) than those typical of GRB/SNe. This confirms the tendency for\nthese quantities to correlate, and suggests that there are minimum requirements\nfor a GRB/SN, which SN2010ah may not meet although it comes quite close.\nDepending on whether a neutron star or a black hole was formed following core\ncollapse, SN2010ah was the explosion of a CO core of ~ 5-6 Mo, pointing to a\nprogenitor mass of ~24 - 28 Mo. \n\n"}

We investigate the temporal\ndecay of the emission from GRB afterglows at late times, when the bulk of the\nshock-accelerated electrons are non-relativistic. For a uniform circumburst\nmedium, we show that such \"deep Newtonian phase\" begins at t_{DN} ~ 3\nepsilon_{e,-1}^{5/6} t_{ST}, where t_{ST} marks the transition of the blast\nwave to the non-relativistic spherically-symmetric Sedov-Taylor solution, and\nepsilon_e = 0.1 epsilon_{e,-1} quantifies the amount of shock energy\ntransferred to the post-shock electrons. For typical parameters, the deep\nNewtonian stage starts ~ 0.5-several years after the GRB. The radio flux in\nthis phase decays as F_nu ~ t^{-3(p+1)/10}, with decay slope between -0.9 and\n-1.2, for a power-law distribution of shock-accelerated electrons with index 2\n< p < 3.

During the two XMM-Newton observations that were carried out\nwhile the source was in outburst in April 2013, IGR J18245-2452 displayed a\nunique and peculiar variability of its X-ray emission. In this work, we report\non a detailed analysis of the XMM- Newton data and focus in particular on the\ntiming and spectral variability of the source. IGR J18245-2452 continuously\nswitches between lower and higher intensity states, with typical variations in\nflux up to a factor of about 500 in time scales as short as few seconds. These\nvariations in the source intensity are sometimes associated to a dramatic\nspectral hardening, during which the power-law photon index of the source\nchanges from Gamma=1.7 to Gamma=0.9. The pulse profiles extracted at different\ncount rates and energies show a complex variability. These phenomena are not\nusually observed in accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars, at least not on such a\nshort time scale. Fast variability was also found in the ATCA radio\nobservations carried out for about 6 hours during the outburst at a frequency\nof 5.5 and 9 GHz. We interpret the variability observed from IGR J18245-2452 in\nterms of a \"hiccup\" accretion phase, during which the accretion of material\nfrom the inner boundary of the Keplerian disk is reduced by the onset of\ncentrifugal inhibition of accretion, possibly causing the launch of strong\noutflows. Changes across accretion and propeller regimes have been long\npredicted and reproduced by MHD simulations of accreting millisecond X-ray\npulsars but never observed to produce an extreme variability as that shown by\nIGR J18245-2452. \n\n"}

We compare the properties\nof different HII regions in the galaxy with the GRB site and study the global\nand local kinematic properties of this galaxy.

The galaxy shows a\ngradient in metallicity and SSFR from the bulge to the outskirts as it is\ncommon for spiral galaxies. This gives further support to the theory that GRBs\nprefer regions of higher star-formation and lower metallicity, which, in S-type\ngalaxies, are more easily found in the spiral arms than in the centre.\nKinematic measurements of the galaxy do not show evidence for large\nperturbations but a minor merger in the past cannot be excluded. This study\nconfirms the collapsar origin of GRB060505 but reveals that the properties of\nthe HII region surrounding the GRB were not unique to that galaxy.

The X-ray light curve of Sw J1644+57 from 5-30 days\npresents two kinds of quasi-periodic variations: a 200 second quasi-periodic\noscillation (QPO) and a 2.7-day quasi-periodic variation.

High-resolution radio detections of MBHs are rare.

For less massive systems, simulations favor the formation of a\nhypermassive, quasi-stable neutron star, whose oscillations produce a short,\nhigh frequency burst of gravitational radiation. Its dominant frequency content\nis tightly correlated with the radius of the neutron star, and its measurement\ncan be used to constrain the supranuclear equation of state.

First, we investigate which region of the neutron star's interior\nand of the equation of state is most responsible for the universality. We find\nthat the universal relation between the moment of inertia and the quadrupole\nmoment is dominated by the star's outer-core, a shell of width (50-95)% of the\ntotal radius, which corresponds to the density range\n$(10^{14}$-$10^{15})$g/cm$^3$. Second, we study the impact on the universality\nof approximating stellar isodensity contours as self-similar ellipsoids. An\nanalytical calculation in the Newtonian limit reveals that the shape of the\nellipsoids does not affect the universal relations, but relaxing the\nself-similarity assumption can completely destroy it.

We find that the fastest\ngrowing linear MRI structures on both local and global domains can look very\ndifferent to the eigenmodes, invariably resembling waves shearing with the\nbackground flow (shear waves).

We\nexamine how the gravitational wave signal of a perturbed black hole is affected\nby such `dirtiness' within linear theory. As a concrete example, we consider\nthe gravitational radiation emitted by the infall of a massive scalar field\ninto a Schwarzschild black hole. Whereas part of the scalar field is\nabsorbed/scattered by the black hole and triggers gravitational wave emission,\nanother part lingers in long-lived quasi-bound states. Solving numerically the\nTeukolsky master equation for gravitational perturbations coupled to the\nmassive Klein-Gordon equation, we find a characteristic gravitational wave\nsignal, composed by a quasi-normal ringing followed by a late time tail. In\ncontrast to `clean' black holes, however, the late time tail contains small\namplitude wiggles with the frequency of the dominating quasi-bound state.\nAdditionally, an observer dependent beating pattern may also be seen. These\nfeatures were already observed in fully non-linear studies; our analysis shows\nthey are present at linear level, and, since it reduces to a 1+1 dimensional\nnumerical problem, allows for cleaner numerical data. Moreover, we discuss the\npower law of the tail and that it only becomes universal sufficiently far away\nfrom the `dirty' black hole. The wiggly tails, by constrast, are a generic\nfeature that may be used as a smoking gun for the presence of massive fields\naround black holes, either as a linear cloud or as fully non-linear hair. \n\n"}

The precise nature\nof the progenitor, however, remains debated owing to spectral ambiguities\narising from a strong contribution from the CSM interaction. Late-time spectra\noffer potential insight if the post-shock cold, dense shell becomes\nsufficiently thin and/or the ejecta begin to cross the reverse shock. To date,\nfew high-quality spectra of this kind exist. Here we report on the late-time\noptical and infrared spectra of the SNe~Ia-CSM 2012ca and 2013dn. These SNe\nIa-CSM spectra exhibit low [Fe III]/[Fe II] ratios and strong [Ca II] at late\nepochs. Such characteristics are reminiscent of the super-Chandrasekhar-mass\n(SC) candidate SN 2009dc, for which these features suggested a low-ionisation\nstate due to high densities, although the broad Fe features admittedly show\nsimilarities to the blue \"quasi-continuum\" observed in some core-collapse SNe\nIbn and IIn. Neither SN 2012ca nor any of the other SNe Ia-CSM show evidence\nfor broad oxygen, carbon, or magnesium in their spectra. Similar to the\ninteracting Type IIn SN 2005ip, a number of high-ionisation lines are\nidentified in SN 2012ca, including [S III], [Ar III], [Ar X], [Fe VIII], [Fe\nX], and possibly [Fe XI]. The total bolometric energy output does not exceed\n10^51 erg, but does require a large kinetic-to-radiative conversion efficiency.\nAll of these observations taken together suggest that SNe Ia-CSM are more\nconsistent with a thermonuclear explosion than a core-collapse event, although\ndetailed radiative transfer models are certainly necessary to confirm these\nresults. \n\n"}

The double-peaked morphology of these four lines is typical\nof the chromosphere of a rotating accretion disk. Nonetheless, the paucity of\ndisk features points towards a low level of irradiation in the system. This is\nconfirmed through spectral energy distribution modeling and we find that the\nUVOT+X-shooter continuum mostly stems from the thermal emission of a viscous\ndisk. We speculate that the absence of reprocessing is due to the compactness\nof an illumination-induced envelope that fails to reflect enough incoming hard\nX-ray photons back to the outer regions.

In a first\ndedicated XMM-Newton observation of the source, we found intriguing evidence of\na very fast spin period. We re-observed 2XMM J104608.7-594306 with XMM-Newton\nto better characterise the spectral energy distribution of the source, confirm\nthe candidate spin period, and possibly constrain the pulsar spin-down.\nStatistically acceptable spectral fits and meaningful physical parameters for\nthe source are only obtained when the purely thermal spectrum is modified by at\nleast one line in absorption. The implied distance is consistent with a\nlocation in (or in front of) the Carina nebula, and radiation radii are\ncompatible with emission originating on most of the surface. Non-thermal X-ray\nemission is ruled out at levels above 0.5% of the source luminosity.\nUnfortunately, the second XMM-Newton observation proved inconclusive in terms\nof confirming (discarding) the fast candidate spin, providing an upper limit on\nthe pulsed fraction of the source that is very close to the limiting\nsensitivity for detecting the modulation found previously. In the absence of an\nunambiguous period determination and an estimate of the magnetic field, the\nnature of the source remains open to interpretation. Its likely association\nwith the Carina cluster and its overall spectral properties (only shared by a\nhandful of other peculiar INSs) disfavour a standard evolutionary path, or one\nin which the source was previously recycled by accretion in a binary system.\nThe INS 2XMM J104608.7-594306 may be similar to Calvera (1RXS\nJ141256.0+792204), a neutron star for which the scenario of an evolved\n`anti-magnetar' has been discussed.

The amplitude\nvariations are anti-correlated in the X-ray and the UV/optical bands.

The power law index \\Gamma\nvaries from 1.2 to 1.0 between superior and inferior conjunction of the neutron\nstar. We interpret the observed X-ray behaviour in terms of synchrotron\nradiation emitted in an extended intrabinary shock, located between the pulsar\nand the donor star, which is eclipsed due to the companion orbital motion. The\nG5 type donor dominates the UV/optical and near-IR emission and is similarly\nfound to be heated up to ? 6500K as in the disc state.

Radiation constraints, which are relevant for high-energy neutrino\nproduction are considered as well. Efficient shock acceleration of cosmic rays\nis possible for sufficiently low-power jets and/or jets buried in a dense,\nextended wind or outer envelope.

Such\nchoked jets may explain transrelativistic supernovae (SNe) and low-luminosity\n(LL) GRBs, giving a unified picture of GRBs and GRB-SNe. Focusing on this\nunified scenario for GRBs, we calculate the resulting neutrino spectra from\nchoked jets including the relevant microphysical processes such as multipion\nproduction in pp and pgamma interactions, as well as the energy losses of\nmesons and muons.

To meet these objectives,\nthe KM3NeT Collaboration plans to build a new Research Infrastructure\nconsisting of a network of deep-sea neutrino telescopes in the Mediterranean\nSea. A phased and distributed implementation is pursued which maximises the\naccess to regional funds, the availability of human resources and the\nsynergetic opportunities for the earth and sea sciences community.

These models include all the relevant\ndynamical processes (such as two-body relaxation, strong encounters, and\nthree-body binary formation) and agree well with detailed direct N-body\nsimulations. In addition, we have enhanced our stellar evolution algorithms\nwith updated metallicity-dependent stellar wind and supernova prescriptions,\nallowing us to compare our results directly to the most recent population\nsynthesis predictions for merger rates from isolated binary evolution.

Secondly, we find that among analysed dSphs, the\nultra-faint dwarf galaxies Triangulum II and Ursa Major II are the most\npromising but large uncertain targets for dark matter annihilation while the\nclassical dSph Draco is the most robust and detectable target for dark matter\ndecay. It is also found that the non-sphericity of luminous and dark components\ninfluences the estimate of astrophysical factors, even though these factors\nlargely depend on the sample size, the prior range of parameters and the\nspatial extent of the dark halo. Moreover, owing to these effects, the\nconstraints on the dark matter annihilation cross-section are more conservative\nthan those of previous spherical works. These results are important for\noptimizing and designing dark matter searches in current and future\nmulti-messenger observations by space and ground-based telescopes. \n\n"}

Abstract: We revisited the unusual wind in GRO J1655-40 detected with Chandra in 2005\nApril, using long-term RXTE X-ray data and simultaneous optical/near-infrared\nphotometric data. This wind is the most convincing case for magnetic driving in\nblack hole binaries, as it has an inferred launch radius which is a factor of\n10 smaller than the thermal wind prediction. However, the optical and\nnear-infrared fluxes monotonically increase around the Chandra observation,\nwhereas the X-ray flux monotonically decreases from 10 days beforehand. Yet the\noptical and near-infrared fluxes are from the outer, irradiated disk, so for\nthem to increase implies that the X-rays likewise increased. We applied a new\nirradiated disk model to the multi-wavelength spectral energy distributions\n(SEDs).

Previous estimates of the\nkinetic energy of the blast waves, based on the X-ray afterglow luminosity\n$L_X$, suggested that this efficiency is large, with values above 90\\% in some\ncases. This poses a problem to emission mechanisms and in particular to the\ninternal shocks model. These estimates are based, however, on the assumption\nthat the X-ray emitting electrons are fast cooling and that their Inverse\nCompton (IC) losses are negligible. The observed correlations between $L_X$\n(and hence the blast wave energy) and $E_{\\gamma\\rm ,iso}$, the isotropic\nequivalent energy in the prompt emission, has been considered as observational\nevidence supporting this analysis. It is reasonable that the prompt gamma-ray\nenergy and the blast wave kinetic energy are correlated and the observed\ncorrelation corroborates, therefore, the notion $L_X$ is indeed a valid proxy\nfor the latter. Recent findings suggest that the magnetic field in the\nafterglow shocks is significantly weaker than was earlier thought and its\nequipartition fraction, $\\epsilon_B$, could be as low as $10^{-4}$ or even\nlower. Motivated by these findings we reconsider the problem, taking now IC\ncooling into account. We find that the observed $L_X-E_{\\gamma\\rm ,iso}$\ncorrelation is recovered also when IC losses are significant. For small\n$\\epsilon_B$ values the blast wave must be more energetic and we find that the\ncorresponding prompt efficiency is significantly smaller than previously\nthought. For example, for $\\epsilon_B\\sim10^{-4}$ we infer a typical prompt\nefficiency of $\\sim15\\%$. \n\n"}

A realistic rapidly rotating star is\nincorporated as the background of jet propagation, and the star is allowed to\ncollapse due to the gravity of the central black hole. By modeling the\nintermittent jets with constant-luminosity pulses with equal on and off\ndurations, we investigate how the half-period, $T$, affects the jet dynamics.\nFor relatively small $T$ values (e.g. 0.2 s), the jet breakout time $t_{\\rm\nbo}$ depends on the opening angle of the jet, with narrower jets more\npenetrating and reaching the surface at shorter times. For $T \\leq 1$ s, the\nreverse shock crosses each pulse before the jet penetrates through the stellar\nenvelope. As a result, after the breakout of the first group of pulses at\n$t_{\\rm bo}$, several subsequent pulses vanish before penetrating the star,\ncausing a quiescent gap. For larger half-periods ($T=2.0, 4.0$ s), all the\npulses can successfully penetrate through the envelope, since each pulse can\npropagate through the star before the reverse shock crosses the shell. Our\nresults may interpret the existence of a weak precursor in many long GRBs,\ngiven that the GRB central engine injects intermittent pulses with half-period\n$T \\leq 1$ s.

Abstract: Cosmic rays (CRs) have recently re-emerged as attractive candidates for\nmediating feedback in galaxies because of their long cooling timescales. They\ncan have energy densities comparable to the thermal gas, but do not suffer\ncatastrophic cooling losses. Recent simulations have shown that the momentum\nand energy deposited by CRs moving with respect to the ambient medium can drive\ngalactic winds. However, simulations are hampered by our ignorance of the\ndetails of CR transport. Two key limits previously considered model CR\ntransport as a purely diffusive process (with a constant diffusion coefficient)\nand as an advective streaming process. With a series of GADGET simulations, we\ncompare and contrast the results of these different assumptions. In idealised\nthree-dimensional galaxy formation models, we show that these two cases result\nin significant differences for the galactic wind mass loss rates and star\nformation suppression in dwarf galaxies with halo masses\n$M\\approx10^{10}\\,\\textrm{M}_\\odot$: diffusive CR transport results in more\nthan ten times larger mass loss rates compared to CR streaming models. We\ndemonstrate that this is largely due to the excitation of Alfv\\'en waves during\nthe CR streaming process that drains energy from the CR population to the\nthermal gas, which is subsequently radiated away. By contrast, CR diffusion\nconserves the CR energy in the absence of adiabatic changes and if CRs are\nefficiently scattered by Alfv\\'en waves that are propagating up the CR\ngradient. Moreover, because pressure gradients are preserved by CR streaming,\nbut not diffusion, the two can have a significantly different dynamical\nevolution regardless of this energy exchange. In particular, the constant\ndiffusion coefficients usually assumed can lead to unphysically high CR fluxes. \n\n"}

The study of the\nHall cascade (Cumming, Arras and Zweibel 2004; Wareing and Hollerbach 2009)\nhinted that energy in small scales structures should dissipate on short\ntimescales. Our new 2D magneto-thermal simulations suggest the opposite. For\nthe first $\\sim$10 kyrs after the fall-back episode with accreted mass $10^{-3}\nM_\\odot$, the observed NS magnetic field appears dipolar, which is insensitive\nto the initial magnetic topology. In framework of the Ruderman & Sutherland\n(1975) vacuum gap model during this interval, non-thermal radiation is strongly\nsuppressed. After this time the initial (i.e. multipolar) structure begins to\nre-emerge through the NS crust. We distinguish three evolutionary epochs for\nthe re-emergence process: the growth of internal toroidal field, the advection\nof buried poloidal field, and slow Ohmic diffusion. The efficiency of the first\ntwo stages can be enhanced when small-scale magnetic structure is present.

We find\nthat its X-ray variations are correlated with and lag the optical/UV\nfluctuations by 32$\\pm$4 days. Based on the direction and the magnitude of the\nX-ray time lag, we rule out X-ray reprocessing and direct emission from a\nstandard circular thin disk as the dominant source of its optical/UV emission.\nThe lag magnitude also rules out an AGN disk-driven instability as the origin\nof ASASSN-14li and thus strongly supports the tidal disruption picture for this\nevent and similar objects. We suggest that the majority of the optical/UV\nemission likely originates from debris stream self-interactions. Perturbations\nat the self-interaction sites produce optical/UV variability and travel down to\nthe black hole where they modulate the X-rays. The time lag between the\noptical/UV and the X-rays variations thus correspond to the time taken by these\nfluctuations to travel from the self-interaction site to close to the black\nhole. We further discuss these time lags within the context of the three\nvariants of the self-interaction model.

Abstract: Long-duration, spectrally-soft Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are associated with\nType Ic Core Collapse (CC) Supernovae (SNe), and thus arise from the death of\nmassive stars. In the collapsar model, the jet launched by the central engine\nmust bore its way out of the progenitor star before it can produce a GRB. Most\nof these jets do not break out, and are instead \"choked\" inside the star, as\nthe central-engine activity time, $t_{\\rm e}$, is not long enough. Modelling\nthe long-soft GRB duration distribution assuming a power-law distribution for\ntheir central-engine activity times, $\\propto t_{\\rm e}^{-\\alpha}$ for $t_{\\rm\ne}>t_{\\rm b}$, we find a steep distribution ($\\alpha\\sim4$) and a typical GRB\njet breakout time of $t_{\\rm b}\\sim 60\\text{ s}$ in the star's frame. The\nlatter suggests the presence of a low-density, extended envelope surrounding\nthe progenitor star, similar to that previously inferred for low-luminosity\nGRBs. Extrapolating the range of validity of this power law below what is\ndirectly observable, to $t_{\\rm e}<t_{\\rm b}$, by only a factor of $\\sim$4-5\nproduces enough events to account for all Type Ib/c SNe.

A white noise power spectral density (PSD) is expected at low\nfrequency in this model, however, direct observational constraint to the low\nfrequency PSD slope is hard due to limited lengths of the light curves\navailable.

The unprecedented five hours of strictly\nsimultaneous X-ray and radio continuum coverage for the first time\nunambiguously show a highly reproducible, anti-correlated variability pattern.\nThe characteristic switches from the X-ray high mode into a low mode are always\naccompanied by a radio brightening with duration that closely matches the X-ray\nlow mode interval. This behavior cannot be explained by a canonical\ninflow/outflow accretion model where the radiated emission and the jet\nluminosity are powered by, and positively correlated with, the available\naccretion energy.

The\ndetection of even a single neutrino can pin down the energy scale of thermal\nneutrino emission from binary-neutron-star mergers and could strongly support\nor disfavor formation of remnant massive neutron stars.

One such set of universal relations between the moment of inertia $(I)$,\nthe tidal Love number and the quadrupole moment $(Q)$ has been studied both in\nGeneral Relativity and in modified theories. In this paper, we study the\nrelations in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity, a well-motivated, parity-violating\neffective field theory, extending previous work in various ways. First, we\nstudy how projected constraints on the theory using the I-Love relation depend\non the measurement accuracy of $I$ with radio observations and that of the Love\nnumber with gravitational-wave observations. Provided these quantities can be\nmeasured with future observations, we find that the latter could place bounds\non dynamical Chern-Simons gravity that are six orders of magnitude stronger\nthan current bounds.

Assuming that bunches are already generated in pulsar\nmagnetospheres, we calculate the spectrum of coherent curvature radiation under\na three-dimensional magnetic field geometry. Different from previous works\nassuming parallel trajectories and a mono-energetic energy distribution of\nelectrons, we consider a bunch characterized by its length, curvature radius of\nthe trajectory family, bunch opening angle, and electron energy distribution.\nWe find that the curvature radiation spectra of the bunches are characterized\nby a multi-segment broken power law, with the break frequencies depending on\nbunch properties and trajectory configuration. We also emphasize that in a\npulsar magnetosphere only the fluctuation of net charges with respect to the\nbackground (Goldreich-Julian) outflow can make a contribution to coherent\nradiation. We apply this model to constrain the observed spectra of pulsars and\nFRBs.

For a prototype host of cosmological long GRBs, a low-metallicity\nstar of 35$\\,M_{\\odot}$, it is $L_{\\rm j}^{\\rm thr} \\simeq 1.35\\times\n10^{49}\\,$erg$\\,$s$^{-1}$. The observed equivalent isotropic $\\gamma$-ray\nluminosity, $L_{\\rm \\gamma,iso,BO} \\simeq 4 \\epsilon_\\gamma L_{\\rm j}\n\\theta_{\\rm BO}^{-2}$, crucially depends on the jet opening angle after\nbreakout, $\\theta_{\\rm BO}$, and on the efficiency for converting the intrinsic\njet luminosity into $\\gamma$-radiation, $\\epsilon_\\gamma$. Highly energetic\njets can produce low-luminosity events if either their opening angle after the\nbreakout is large, which is found in our models, or if the conversion\nefficiency of kinetic and internal energy into radiation is low enough. Beyond\nthis theoretical analysis, we show how the presence of a SN shock wave may\nreduce this luminosity threshold by means of numerical simulations. We foresee\nthat the high-energy transients released by jets produced near the luminosity\nthreshold will be more similar to llGRBs or XRFs than to GRBs. \n\n"}

However, the astrophysical origin of merging binaries\nis not well understood. Stellar binaries are typically at much larger\nseparations than what is needed for the binaries to merge due to gravitational\nwave emission, which leads to the so-called final AU problem. In this letter we\npropose a new channel for mergers of compact object binaries which solves the\nfinal AU problem. We examine the binary evolution following gas expansion due\nto a weak failed supernova explosion, neutrino mass loss, core disturbance, or\nenvelope instability. In such situations the binary is possibly hardened by\nambient gas. We investigate the evolution of the binary system after a shock\nhas propagated by performing smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations. We\nfind that significant binary hardening occurs when the gas mass bound to the\nbinary exceeds that of the compact objects.

The low energy peak of the\nspectrum in the hard X-ray NuSTAR band, which peaks before the expected onset\nof a Compton hump, rules out strong reflection as the origin of the hard excess\nin this AGN.

If the diffusion coefficient well outside the\nnebula is close to the value inferred for the region inside the nebula,\nhigh-energy electrons and positrons produced by the two observed pulsars could\nnot contribute significantly to the local measured cosmic-ray flux.

The tidal disruption of stellar binaries by a massive BH is\nknown to produce hypervelocity stars. However, such a tidal encounter does not\nalways lead to the break-up of binaries. Since surviving binaries tend to\nbecome hard and eccentric, this process can produce BH mergers in principle.\nFor initially circular binaries, we show that the gravitational wave (GW)\nmerger times become shorter by a factor of more than $10^{2}$ ($10^5$) in\n$10\\%$ ($1\\%$) of the surviving cases. This reduction is primarily due to the\ngrowth in binary's eccentricity at the tidal encounter. We also investigate the\neffective spins of the survivors, assuming that BH spins are initially aligned\nwith the binary orbital angular momentum. We find that binary orientations can\nflip in the opposite direction at the tidal encounter. For the survivors with\nlarge merger time reduction factors, the effective spin distribution is rather\nflat. We estimate the merger rate due to the tidal encounter channel to be\n$\\sim 0.6\\ \\textrm{Gpc}^{-3}\\textrm{yr}^{-1}$.

Unfortunately, Boltzmann's equations of\nradiation transport remain too costly to be evolved directly in merger\nsimulations. Simulations rely instead on approximate transport algorithms with\nunquantified modeling errors. In this paper, we use for the first time a\ntime-dependent general relativistic Monte-Carlo (MC) algorithm to solve\nBoltzmann's equations and estimate important properties of the neutrino\ndistribution function ~10ms after a neutron star merger. We do not fully couple\nthe MC algorithm to the fluid evolution, but use a short evolution of the\nmerger remnant to critically assess errors in our approximate gray two-moment\ntransport scheme. We demonstrate that the analytical closure used by the moment\nscheme is highly inaccurate in the polar regions, but performs well elsewhere.\nWhile the average energy of polar neutrinos is reasonably well captured by the\ntwo-moment scheme, estimates for the neutrino energy become less accurate at\nlower latitudes. The two-moment formalism also overestimates the density of\nneutrinos in the polar regions by ~50%, and underestimates the neutrino\npair-annihilation rate at the poles by factors of 2-3. Although the latter is\nsignificantly more accurate than one might have expected before this study, our\nresults indicate that predictions for the properties of polar outflows and for\nthe creation of a baryon-free region at the poles are likely to be affected by\nerrors in the two-moment scheme, thus limiting our ability to reliably model\nkilonovae and gamma-ray bursts. \n\n"}

In the proton\nsynchrotron scenario, a strong magnetic field of $10-100$~G is required,\nimplying that the particle acceleration is likely driven by magnetic energy\ndissipation such as magnetic reconnection events. The inverse Compton scenario\nimplies a magnetic field of $0.1-1$~G. Thus the particle acceleration is likely\ndriven by the kinetic energy dissipation such as shocks. We also discuss the\nneutrino production in the context of single-zone and multi-zone models based\non the above two scenarios. We demonstrate that the variability and optical\npolarization signatures can be used to distinguish the two scenarios due to\ntheir drastically different magnetic field. Specifically, the proton\nsynchrotron scenario may show orphan fast variability in the low-energy\nspectral component on top of the active state, with an optical polarization\ndegree $\\lesssim 10\\%$ throughout the active state. The inverse Compton\nscattering scenario instead predicts co-variability of the low- and high-energy\ncomponents on both short and long time scales, as well as a strongly variable\noptical polarization degree that can reach $\\gtrsim 20\\%$. Our results suggest\nthat optical polarization measurements and well-resolved multi-wavelength light\ncurves can be used to understand the electromagnetic and high-energy neutrino\nemissions by TXS~0506+056 and similar events in the future. \n\n"}

In previous studies\npower-law-type heating rates (e.g., ~ t^-1.3) have frequently been used, which\nmay be inadequate if the ejecta are dominated by nuclei other than the A ~ 130\nregion. We consider, therefore, two reference abundance distributions that\nmatch the r-process residuals to the solar abundances for A >= 69 (light\ntrans-iron plus r-process elements) and A >= 90 (r-process elements).\nNucleosynthetic abundances are obtained by using free-expansion models with\nthree parameters: expansion velocity, entropy, and electron fraction.\nRadioactive energies are calculated as an ensemble of weighted free-expansion\nmodels that reproduce the reference abundance patterns. The results are\ncompared with the bolometric luminosity (> a few days since merger) of the\nkilonova associated with GW170817. We find that the former case (fitted for A\n>= 69) with an ejecta mass 0.06 M_sun reproduces the light curve remarkably\nwell including its steepening at > 7 days, in which the mass of r-process\nelements is ~ 0.01 M_sun. Two beta-decay chains are identified: 66Ni -> 66Cu ->\n66Zn and 72Zn -> 72Ga -> 72Ge with similar halflives of parent isotopes (~ 2\ndays), which leads to an exponential-like evolution of heating rates during\n1-15 days. The light curve at late times (> 40 days) is consistent with\nadditional contributions from the spontaneous fission of 254Cf and a few Fm\nisotopes. If this is the case, the event GW170817 is best explained by the\nproduction of both light trans-iron and r-process elements that originate from\ndynamical ejecta and subsequent disk outflows from the neutron star merger. \n\n"}

In this work, we\nstudy for the first time head-on collisions of relativistic ASs with black\nholes (BHs) and neutron stars (NSs). In the case of BH-AS mergers we find that,\nin general, the largest scalar clouds are produced by mergers of low\ncompactness ASs and spinning BHs. Although in most of the cases which we study\nthe majority of the mass is absorbed by the BH within a short time after the\nmerger, in favourable cases the remaining cloud surrounding the final BH\nremnant can be as large as 30% of the initial axion star mass, with a bosonic\ncloud mass of order ~ 0.1 M_BH and peak energy density comparable to that\nobtained in a superradiant build up. This provides a dynamical mechanism for\nthe formation of long lived scalar hair, which could lead to observable signals\nin cases where the axion interacts with baryonic matter around the BH, or where\nit forms the seed of a future superradiant build up in highly spinning cases.\nConsidering NS-AS collisions we find two possible final states (i) a BH\nsurrounded by a (small) scalar cloud, or (ii) a stable NS enveloped in an axion\ncloud of roughly the same mass as the initial AS. Whilst for low mass ASs the\nNS is only mildly perturbed by the collision, a larger mass AS gives rise to a\nmassive ejection of baryonic mass from the system, purely due to gravitational\neffects. Therefore, even in the absence of a direct axion coupling to baryonic\nmatter, NS-AS collisions could give rise to electromagnetic observables in\naddition to their gravitational wave signatures. \n\n"}

Jets and the bubbles they inflate transfer heat to the\nambient gas in cooling flows in cluster of galaxies and in galaxies. The\ninternal energy of the jet-inflated bubbles is dominate by very hot thermal gas\nand/or cosmic rays. Cosmic rays that stream along magnetic field lines that\nconnect the bubbles with the ICM heat the ICM as their energy is dissipated\nthere. I find that about half of the cosmic ray energy is dissipated in the\nbubbles themselves. I also find that the ICM volume that the cosmic ray\nstreaming process heats is only about five times as large as the volume of the\nbubbles. The outcome of heating by streaming only is that the cosmic rays form\na larger bubble filled with very hot thermal gas. Therefore, there is a\nrequirement for a more efficient process to transfer the internal energy of the\nbubbles to the ICM.

Coefficients characterizing the spin-induced\nmultipole moments of Kerr black holes are predicted by the \"no-hair\" conjecture\nand appear in the gravitational waveforms through quadratic and higher order\nspin interactions and hence can be directly measured from gravitational wave\nobservations. We assess the capabilities of the third-generation gravitational\nwave interferometers such as Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope in carrying\nout such measurements and use them to test the binary black hole nature of\nobserved binaries. In this paper, we extend the investigations of our previous\nwork, by proposing to measure (a) spin-induced quadrupole effects, (b)\nsimultaneous measurements of spin-induced quadrupole and octupole effects, in\nthe context of the third-generation detectors. We find that, using\nthird-generation detectors the symmetric combination of coefficients associated\nwith spin-induced quadrupole moment of each binary component may be constrained\nto a value $\\leq 1.1$ while a similar combination of coefficients for\nspin-induced octupole moment may be constrained to $\\leq 2$, where both\ncombinations take the value of 1 for a binary black hole system.

This process can repeat several times and lead to\nsignificant mass growth. In this paper, we calculate the mass of the largest BH\nthat can be formed through repeated mergers of stellar seed BHs and determine\nhow its value depends on the physical properties of the host cluster. We adopt\nan analytical model in which the energy generated by the black hole binaries in\nthe cluster core is assumed to be regulated by the process of two-body\nrelaxation in the bulk of the system. This principle is used to compute the\nhardening rate of the binaries and to relate this to the time-dependent global\nproperties of the parent cluster. We demonstrate that in clusters with initial\nescape velocity $\\gtrsim 300\\rm km\\ s^{-1}$ in the core and density $\\gtrsim\n10^5\\ M_\\odot\\rm pc^{-3}$, repeated mergers lead to the formation of BHs in the\nmass range $100-10^5 \\,M_\\odot$, populating any upper mass gap created by\npair-instability supernovae.

Except from the random\ntiming noise, significant periodic or quasi-periodic components could also be\nfound in some timing residuals of pulsars, indicating the presence of\nunmodelled deterministic effects.

In this paper, we suggest a new mechanism involving the de\nHaas-van Alphen magnetic oscillation, which could trigger the observed low\nfrequency structures.

The relative contribution of each grain type to the total\nEBL energy density was determined from a combined fit to the Markarian 501\n($z\\sim 0.034$) SED in flare state, where both the parameters of the intrinsic\nsource spectrum and the dust fractions were allowed to vary. By separating the\nattenuation due to each EBL component, the importance of individual grain types\nto the opacity of the extragalactic medium for the TeV emission of a blazar\nlike Markarian 501 could be better understood. Using a nested log-likelihood\nratio test, we compared null hypotheses represented by effective 1- and 2-grain\nmodels against a 3-grain alternative scenario. When the temperatures of the\ngrains are fixed a priori, the 1-grain scenario with only PAHs can be excluded\nat more than 5$\\sigma$, irrespective of the curvature in the intrinsic\nspectrum. The 3-grain EBL model with the tuned fractions was finally used to\nfit the SEDs of a sample of extragalactic gamma-ray sources.

The\ntotal flux of active ^8B neutrinos is thus determined to be 5.44 +/-0.99 x\n10^6/cm^2 s, in close agreement with the predictions of solar models. \n\n"}
