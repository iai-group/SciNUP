Compatible with the example\nof SFT of closed geodesics, it turns out that the corresponding localization\ntheorem requires a non-equivariant version of SFT, which is generated by\nparametrized instead of unparametrized closed Reeb orbits. Since this\nnon-equivariant version is so far only defined for cylindrical contact\nhomology, we restrict ourselves to this special case.

The part of\ndeformed algebra, generated by rotation, boost and momentum generators, is\ndescribed by the Hopf algebra structure. The approach used in our\nconsiderations is completely Lorentz covariant. We further use an adventages of\nthis approach to consistently construct a star product which has a property\nthat under integration sign it can be replaced by a standard pointwise\nmultiplication, a property that was since known to hold for Moyal, but not also\nfor kappa-Minkowski spacetime.

Here, various constraints can be placed on the dynamics, based on\nquantum information-theoretic and other general physical considerations, and\none can seek to describe dynamics with \"minimal\" departure from field theory.\nWhile usual spacetime locality may not be a precise concept in quantum gravity,\napproximate locality seems an important ingredient in physics. In such a\nHilbert space approach an apparently \"coarser\" form of localization can be\ndescribed in terms of tensor decompositions of the Hilbert space of the\ncomplete system. This suggests a general framework in which to seek a\nconsistent description of quantum gravity, and approximate emergence of\nspacetime. Other possible aspects of such a framework -- in particular\nsymmetries -- are briefly discussed. \n\n"}

Powerful mathematical tools can be used to\nestablish qualitative statements about the solutions, such as their existence,\nuniqueness, continuous dependence on the initial data, or their asymptotic\nbehavior over large time scales. However, one is often interested in computing\nthe solution itself, and unless the partial differential equation is very\nsimple, or the initial data possesses a high degree of symmetry, this\ncomputation requires approximation by numerical discretization. When solving\nsuch discrete problems on a machine, one is faced with a finite limit to\ncomputational resources, which leads to the replacement of the infinite\ncontinuum domain with a finite computer grid. This, in turn, leads to a\ndiscrete initial-boundary value problem.

We further show that all such\nnoncommutative theories will have same fixed points and $\\beta$-functions for\nthe couplings, as that of the analogous commutative theory.

{"id": "1309.1238", "contents": "Title: Parametrization of degenerate density matrices Abstract: This paper presents a parametrization of a degenerate density matrix. The\nproblem needs to be approached first with a diagonalized form (the spectral\nrepresentation) to deal with degeneracy. Such a form is useful for this\nparametrization in that the conditions to be a density matrix from a Hermitian\nmatrix are applied only to a diagonal eigenvalue matrix, not a unitary matrix.\nThose conditions can be satisfied by parametrizing eigenvalues with squared\nspherical coordinates in dimension of the matrix. Degeneracy in eigenvalues\nbrings symmetries between a eigenvalue matrix and a unitary matrix, which are\nrealized in a form of a commuting unitary matrix, called a commutant. The\nassociated redundant parameters in a unitary matrix have to be eliminated. It\nis realized in this paper that degrees of degeneracies can be defined as the\ntotal number of possible pairs of the same eigenvalues and one degree of\ndegeneracy corresponds to one phase and one two dimensional rotation in a\nunitary matrix or a commutant. In this way all the degeneracies are identified\nand assigned to one phase-one rotation block. Therefore, a unitary matrix or a\ncommutant is a product of these blocks and a general diagonal phase matrix. In\nphysics a unitary matrix is often parametrized by rotation and phase matrices,\ncalled an angular representation here. There are many possible different phase\nconfigurations. It is often not a trivial matter whether a given parametrized\nunitary matrix is general.

Then, Fourier transforming\nthe data obtained in the evolution confirms the results obtained in the\nfrequency domain analysis, in particular for the fast growing modes. We show\nthat spherically symmetric (l=0) modes have even faster growth rates than the\nl=1 modes for `small' field charge. Thus, our study confirms that this setup is\nparticularly promising for considering the non-linear development of the\nsuperradiant instability, since the fast growth makes the signal overcome the\nnumerical error that dominates for small growth rates, and the analysis may be\ncompletely done in spherical symmetry. \n\n"}

In many cases, such\nsystems exhibit strong anomalous diffusion, where low order moments $< |x(t)|^q\n>$ with $q$ below a critical value $q_c$ exhibit diffusive scaling while for\n$q>q_c$ a ballistic scaling emerges. The mixed dynamics constitutes a\ntheoretical challenge since it does not fall into a unique category of motion,\ne.g., the known diffusion equations and central limit theorems fail to describe\nboth aspects.

Although knots and links are observables of\nthe Chern-Simons (C-S) functional, the dynamical conditions for their\ngeneration lie outside of the scope of the C-S theory. The nontriviality of\ndynamical generation of knotted structures is caused by the fact that the\ncomplements of all knots/links, say, in S^3 are 3-manifolds which have\npositive, negative or zero curvature. The ability to curve the ambient space\nthus far is attributed to masses. The mass theorem of general relativity\nrequires the ambient 3-manifolds to be of non negative curvature. Recently, we\nestablished that, in the absence of boundaries, complements of dynamically\ngenerated knots/links are represented by 3-manifolds of non negative curvature.\nThis fact opens the possibility to discuss masses in terms of dynamically\ngenerated knotted/ linked structures. The key tool is the notion of knot/link\nconcordance. The concept of concordance is an adaptation of the concept of\ncobordism to knots and links.

Since the shadow is determined by a set of\nspecial photon orbits, rather than horizon properties, it is possible that\ndifferent horizon geometries yield similar shadows. One may then ask how\nsensitive is the shadow to details of the horizon geometry? As a case study, we\nconsider the double Schwarzschild BH and analyse the impact on the lensing and\nshadows of the conical singularity that holds the two BHs in equilibrium --\nherein taken to be a strut along the symmetry axis in between the two BHs.\nWhereas the conical singularity induces a discontinuity of the scattering angle\nof photons, clearly visible in the lensing patterns along the direction of the\nstrut's location, it produces no observable effect on the shadows, whose edges\nremain everywhere smooth.

Abstract: The prediction that black holes radiate due to quantum effects is often\nconsidered one of the most secure in quantum field theory in curved space-time.\nYet this prediction rests on two dubious assumptions: that ordinary physics may\nbe applied to vacuum fluctuations at energy scales increasing exponentially\nwithout bound; and that quantum-gravitational effects may be neglected. Various\nsuggestions have been put forward to address these issues: that they might be\nexplained away by lessons from sonic black hole models; that the prediction is\nindeed successfully reproduced by quantum gravity; that the success of the link\nprovided by the prediction between black holes and thermodynamics justifies the\nprediction.\n  This paper explains the nature of the difficulties, and reviews the proposals\nthat have been put forward to deal with them. None of the proposals put forward\ncan so far be considered to be really successful, and simple dimensional\narguments show that quantum-gravitational effects might well alter the\nevaporation process outlined by Hawking. Thus a definitive theoretical\ntreatment will require an understanding of quantum gravity in at least some\nregimes.

Recently, the initial conditions of the pre-big bang\nscenario have been criticized as they introduce large dimensionless parameters\nallowing the Universe to be \"exponentially large from the very beginning\".

In general relativity, the equivalence principle tells us the\nexistence of a local inertial coordinate system and the fundamental laws in the\nlocal inertial coordinate system which are the same as those in inertial\nreference system. Then, after a general coordinate transformation, the\nfundamental laws of nature in arbitrary coordinate system or in arbitrary\ncurved space-time can be obtained. However, through a simple example, we find\nthat, under a general coordinate transformation, basic physical equations in\ngeneral relativity do not transform covariantly, especially they do not\npreserve their forms under the transformation from a local inertial coordinate\nsystem to a curved space-time. The origination of the violation of the general\ncovariance is then studied, and a general theory on general coordinate\ntransformations is developed. Because of the the existence of the\nnon-homogeneous term, the fundamental laws of nature in arbitrary curved\nspace-time can not be expressed by space-time metric, physical observable and\ntheir derivatives. In other words, basic physical equations obtained from the\nequivalence principle and the principle of general covariance are different\nfrom those in general relativity. Both the equivalence principle and the\nprinciple of general covariance can not be treated as foundations of general\nrelativity. So, what are the foundations of General Relativity?

Abstract: We solve the equations of motion of the tachyon and the discrete states in\nthe background of Witten's semiclassical black hole and in the exact 2D\ndilaton-graviton background of Dijkgraaf et al. We find the exact solutions for\nweak fields, leading to conclusions in disagreement with previous studies of\ntachyons in the black hole. Demanding that a state in the black hole be well\nbehaved at the horizon implies that it must tend asymptotically to a\ncombination of a Seiberg and an anti-Seiberg c=1 state. For such a state to be\nwell behaved asymptotically, it must satisfy the condition that neither its\nSeiberg nor its anti-Seiberg Liouville momentum is positive. Thus, although the\nfree-field BRST cohomologies of the underlying SL(2,R)/U(1) theory is the same\nas that of a c=1 theory, the black hole spectrum is drastically truncated:\nTHERE ARE NO W_INFINITY STATES, AND ONLY TACHYONS WITH X-MOMENTA | P_TACH | <=\n| M_TACH | ARE ALLOWED. In the Minkowski case only the static tachyon is\nallowed. The black hole is stable to the back reaction of these remaining\ntachyons, so they are good perturbations of the black hole, or ``hair''.\nHowever, this leaves only 3 tachyonic hairs in the black hole and 7 in the\nexact solution! Such sparse hair is clearly irrelevant to the maintenance of\ncoherence during black hole evaporation. \n\n"}

Then we see that the deformation space of the subfamily\nis the same as a certain family of K3 toric surfaces. This family can in turn\nbe studied by further degeneration along a subfamily which in the end is\ndescribed by a family of elliptic curves. The periods of the K3 family (and\nhence the original Calabi-Yau family) can be described by the squares of the\nperiods of the elliptic curves. The consequences include: (1) proofs of various\nconjectural formulas of physicists \\vk\\lkm~ involving mirror maps and modular\nfunctions; (2) new identities involving multi-variable hypergeometric series\nand modular functions -- generalizing \\lianyaufour.

The central object is the one-particle distribution function,\n$f$, which in the Boltzmann-Grad limit satisfies the Boltzmann equation. Grad\nand, much refined, Cercignani argue for the existence of this limit on the\nbasis of the BBGKY hierarchy for hard spheres. At least for a short kinetic\ntime span, the argument can be made mathematically precise following the\nseminal work of Lanford. In this article a corresponding programme is\nundertaken for weakly nonlinear, both discrete and continuum, wave equations.\nOur working example is the harmonic lattice with a weakly nonquadratic on-site\npotential. We argue that the role of the Boltzmann $f$-function is taken over\nby the Wigner function, which is a very convenient device to filter the slow\ndegrees of freedom. The Wigner function, so to speak, labels locally the\ncovariances of dynamically almost stationary measures. One route to the phonon\nBoltzmann equation is a Gaussian decoupling, which is based on the fact that\nthe purely harmonic dynamics has very good mixing properties. As a further\napproach the expansion in terms of Feynman diagrams is outlined. Both methods\nare extended to the quantized version of the weakly nonlinear wave equation.\n  The resulting phonon Boltzmann equation has been hardly studied on a rigorous\nlevel.
