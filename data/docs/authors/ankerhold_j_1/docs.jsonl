We demonstrate that such nanoribbon always has a gap in its\nelectronic spectrum. Indeed, even in the situations where simple\nsingle-electron calculations predict a metallic dispersion, the system is\nunstable with respect to the deformation of the carbon-carbon bonds dangling at\nthe edges of the armchair nanoribbon. The edge bonds' deformation couples\nelectron and hole states with equal momentum. This coupling opens a gap at the\nFermi level. In a realistic sample, however, it is unlikely that this\ninstability could be observed in its pure form. Namely, since chemical\nproperties of the dangling carbon atoms are different from chemical properties\nof the atoms inside the sample (for example, the atoms at the edge have only\ntwo neighbours, besides additional non-carbon atoms might be attached to\npassivate unpaired covalent carbon bonds), it is very probable that the bonds\nat the edge are deformed due to chemical interactions. This chemically-induced\nmodification of the nanoribbon's edges can be viewed as an effective field\nbiasing our predicted instability in a particular direction. Yet by disordering\nthis field (e.g., through random substitution of the radicals attached to the\nedges) we may tune the system back to the critical regime and vary the\nelectronic properties of the system.

This\nhas predictive value because, while the transport coefficients of dense fluids\nare difficult to estimate from first principles, excess entropy can often be\naccurately predicted from liquid-state theory. Here, we use molecular\nsimulations to investigate whether Rosenfeld's observation is a special case of\na more general scaling law relating mobility of particles in mixtures to excess\nentropy. Specifically, we study tracer diffusivities, static structure, and\nthermodynamic properties of a variety of one- and two-component model fluid\nsystems with either additive or non-additive interactions of the hard-sphere or\nGaussian-core form. The results of the simulations demonstrate that the effects\nof mixture concentration and composition, particle-size asymmetry and\nadditivity, and strength of the interparticle interactions in these fluids are\nconsistent with an empirical scaling law relating the excess entropy to a new\ndimensionless (generalized Rosenfeld) form of tracer diffusivity, which we\nintroduce here.

Recently, substantial progress was achieved in enhancing the\ntime within which a solid-state qubit demonstrates coherent dynamics. This\nprogress is based mostly on a successful isolation of the qubits from external\ndecoherence sources obtained by clever engineering. Under these conditions, the\nmaterial-inherent sources of noise start to play a crucial role. In most cases,\nquantum devices are affected by noise decreasing with frequency, f,\napproximately as 1/f. According to the present point of view, such noise is due\nto material- and device-specific microscopic degrees of freedom interacting\nwith quantum variables of the nanodevice. The simplest picture is that the\nenvironment that destroys the phase coherence of the device can be thought of\nas a system of two-state fluctuators, which experience random hops between\ntheir states. If the hopping times are distributed in a exponentially broad\ndomain, the resulting fluctuations have a spectrum close to 1/f in a large\nfrequency range.

The interesting aspect of such\na construction is that even though the topological building blocks in the low\ndimension may be gapped, the higher dimensional semimetallic phase emerges as a\ngapless critical point of a topological phase transition between two distinct\ninsulating phases. In this work, we extend this idea by constructing\nthree-dimensional topological semimetallic phases akin to Weyl systems by\nstacking one-dimensional Aubry-Andre-Harper (AAH) lattice tight binding models\nwith non-trivial topology. The generalized AAH model is a family of one\ndimensional tight binding models with cosine modulations in both hopping and\nonsite energy terms. In this paper, we present a two-parameter generalization\nof the AAH model that can access topological phases in three dimensions within\na unified framework. We show that the $\\pi$-flux state of this two-parameter\nAAH model manifests three dimensional topological semimetallic phases where the\ntopological features are embedded in one dimension. The topological nature of\nthe band touching points of the semimetallic phase in 3D is explicitly\nestablished both analytically and numerically from the 1D perspective. This\ndimensional reduction provides a simple protocol to experimentally construct\nthe three dimensional Brillouin zone of the topological semimetallic phases\nusing `legos' of simple 1D double well optical lattices.

This\ntheory amounts to an infinite hierarchy of coupled equations for multi-point\ndensity correlations, the lowest-order closure of which is equivalent to\nstandard mode-coupling theory. Here we focus on simplified schematic GMCT\nhierarchies, which lack any explicit wavevector-dependence and therefore allow\nfor greater analytical and numerical tractability. For one particular schematic\nmodel, we derive the unique analytic solution of the infinite hierarchy, and\ndemonstrate that closing the hierarchy at finite order leads to uniform\nconvergence as the closure level increases. We also show numerically that a\nsimilarly robust convergence pattern emerges for more generic schematic GMCT\nmodels, suggesting that the GMCT framework is generally convergent, even though\nno small parameter exists in the theory.

Due to the vast number of environmental degrees of freedom, it is\nchallenging to accurately calculate decoherence times $T_2$, especially when\nthe qubit and environment are highly correlated.\n  Hybrid or mixed electron-nuclear spin qubits, such as donors in silicon,\npossess 'optimal working points' (OWPs) which are sweet-spots for reduced\ndecoherence in magnetic fields. Analysis of sharp variations of $T_2$ near OWPs\nwas previously based on insensitivity to classical noise, even though hybrid\nqubits are situated in highly correlated quantum environments, such as the\nnuclear spin bath of $^{29}$Si impurities. This presented limited understanding\nof the decoherence mechanism and gave unreliable predictions for $T_2$.\n  I present quantum many-body calculations of the qubit-bath dynamics, which\n(i) yield $T_2$ for hybrid qubits in excellent agreement with experiments in\nmultiple regimes, (ii) elucidate the many-body nature of the nuclear spin bath\nand (iii) expose significant differences between quantum-bath and\nclassical-field decoherence.

Here, we extend the concept of Thouless pumps of band\ninsulators by considering a larger, three-dimensional parameter space.

We compute\nconstraints on electron fillings and band connectivity compatible with\ninsulating behavior.

However, these known results rely crucially on the assumption that\nthe thermal machine is not only exactly preserved in every cycle, but also kept\nuncorrelated from the quantum systems on which it acts. Here we lift this\nrestriction: we allow the machine to become correlated with the microscopic\nsystems on which it acts, while still exactly preserving its own state.\nSurprisingly, we show that this restores the second law in its original form:\nfree energy alone determines the possible state transitions, and the\ncorresponding amount of work can be invested or extracted from single systems\nexactly and without any fluctuations. At the same time, the work reservoir\nremains uncorrelated from all other systems and parts of the machine. Thus,\nmicroscopic machines can increase their efficiency via clever \"correlation\nengineering\" in a perfectly cyclic manner, which is achieved by a catalytic\nsystem that can sometimes be as small as a single qubit (though some setups\nrequire very large catalysts).

However, the number of derivatives that must\nbe simultaneously set to zero grows exponentially with the number of coupled\nqubits, making the task untenable for as few as two qubits. This is a\nparticular problem for adiabatic gates, due to their slower speeds.

As with any qubit implementation, a crucial requirement is the\nability to measure individual quantum states rapidly and with high fidelity. As\nthe signal from a single electron spin is minute, different spin states are\nconverted to different charge states. Charge detection so far mostly relied on\nexternal electrometers, which hinders scaling to two-dimensional spin qubit\narrays. As an alternative, gate-based dispersive read-out based on off-chip\nlumped element resonators were introduced, but here integration times of 0.2 to\n2 ms were required to achieve single-shot read-out. Here we connect an on-chip\nsuperconducting resonant circuit to two of the gates that confine electrons in\na double quantum dot. Measurement of the power transmitted through a feedline\ncoupled to the resonator probes the charge susceptibility, distinguishing\nwhether or not an electron can oscillate between the dots in response to the\nprobe power.

This transition has been\ntheoretically studied since the early sixties, mostly within an approach in\nwhich the microscopic configurations of a DNA molecule are given by an\nalternating sequence of non-interacting bound segments and denaturated loops.\nStudies of these models neglect the repulsive, self-avoiding, interaction\nbetween different loops and segments and have invariably yielded continuous\ndenaturation transitions. In this study we exploit recent results on scaling\nproperties of polymer networks of arbitrary topology in order to take into\naccount the excluded-volume interaction between denaturated loops and the rest\nof the chain. We thus obtain a first-order phase transition in d=2 dimensions\nand above, in agreement with experiments. We also consider within our approach\nthe unzipping transition, which takes place when the two DNA strands are pulled\napart by an external force acting on one end. We find that the unzipping\ntransition is also first order. Although the denaturation and unzipping\ntransitions are thermodynamically first order, they do exhibit critical\nfluctuations in some of their properties. For instance, the loop size\ndistribution decays algebraically at the transition and the length of the\ndenaturated end segment diverges as the transition is approached. We evaluate\nthese critical properties within our approach. \n\n"}

The long-range order of such an electron crystal (or\nequivalently, a $4 k_F$ charge-density wave) is destroyed by impurities. The 3D\narray of chains behaves differently at large and at small impurity\nconcentrations $N$. At large $N$, impurities divide the chains into metallic\nrods. The low-temperature conductivity is due to the variable-range hopping of\nelectrons between the rods. It obeys the Efros-Shklovskii (ES) law and\nincreases exponentially as $N$ decreases. When $N$ is small, the metallic-rod\npicture of the ground state survives only in the form of rare clusters of\natypically short rods. They are the source of low-energy charge excitations.

In particlular we suggest that instead of a two level system (qubit)\nthe basic notion in a relativistic quantum information theory should be a\nnotion of an elementary quantum system, i.e. an infinite dimensional Hilbert\nspace $H$ invariant under an irreducible representation of the Poincare group\nlabeled by $[m,s]$ where $m\\geq 0$ is mass and $s=0,1/2,1,...$ is spin.
