Curve Flows and Solitonic Hierarchies Abstract: The geometric constructions are elaborated on (semi) Riemannian manifolds and\nvector bundles provided with nonintegrable distributions defining nonlinear\nconnection structures induced canonically by metric tensors. Such spaces are\ncalled nonholonomic manifolds and described by two equivalent linear\nconnections also induced in unique forms by a metric tensor (the Levi Civita\nand the canonical distinguished connection, d-connection). The lifts of\ngeometric objects on tangent bundles are performed for certain classes of\nd-connections and frame transforms when the Riemann tensor is parametrized by\nconstant matrix coefficients. For such configurations, the flows of\nnon-stretching curves and corresponding bi-Hamilton and solitonic hierarchies\nencode information about Ricci flow evolution, Einstein spaces and exact\nsolutions in gravity and geometric mechanics. The applied methods were\nelaborated formally in Finsler geometry and allows us to develop the formalism\nfor generalized Riemann-Finsler and Lagrange spaces. Nevertheless, all\ngeometric constructions can be equivalently re-defined for the Levi Civita\nconnections and holonomic frames on (semi) Riemannian manifolds. \n\n"}

The most common approach to the problem is to generate the mu term\nthrough a SUSY breaking F-term. Often these models produce unacceptably large B\nmu terms as a result. We will present an alternate approach, where the mu term\nis generated directly by non-perturtative effects. The same non-perturbative\neffect will also retrofit the model of SUSY breaking in such a way that mu is\nat the same scale as masses of the Standard Model superpartners. Because the mu\nterm is not directly generated by SUSY breaking effects, there is no associated\nB mu problem. These results are demonstrated in a toy model where a stringy\ninstanton generates mu. \n\n"}

The EFP is the probability that a region of space is completely\nvoid of particles in the ground state of a quantum many body system.

This condition is equivalent to a spectral assumption for a linear\nsecond order ordinary differential operator. In other words, we reduce the\nproblem of stable blow up to a linear ODE spectral problem. Although we are\nunable, at the moment, to verify the mode stability of $f_0$ rigorously, it is\nknown that possible unstable eigenvalues are confined to a certain compact\nregion in the complex plane. As a consequence, highly reliable numerical\ntechniques can be applied and all available results strongly suggest the\nnonexistence of unstable modes, i.e., the assumed mode stability of $f_0$. \n\n"}

Recently, the interest in this area has\nbeen revived trough the anti-de-Sitter space/Conformal Field Theory\ncorrespondence (AdS/CFT) with the difference that in this case the background\ngeometry is Anti de Sitter in five dimensions. In a recent project that we have\ncompleted in the context of AdS/CFT, we have gained insight in the problem of\nshockwaves and our goal in this work is to apply the technique we have\ndeveloped there in the case of ordinary gravity. In the current project, each\nof the shockwaves correspond to a point-like Stress-Energy tensor that moves\nwith the speed of light while the collision is asymmetric and involves an\nimpact parameter (b). Our method is to expand the metric $(g_{\\mu \\nu})$ in the\nbackground of flat space-time in the presence of the two shockwaves and compute\ncorrections that satisfy causal boundary conditions taking into account\nback-reactions of the Stress-Energy tensor of the two point-like particles. Our\nsolution respects causality as expected but this casual dependence takes place\nin an intuitive way.

We test this conjecture studying\nthe field correlations in the more general case of an arbitrary pre-quench\nHamiltonian, while keeping the post-quench one noninteracting.

The mutation of a\ntypical quiver will not generate a recurrence, but rather an erratic sequence\nof exchange relations. How do we \"design\" a quiver which gives rise to a given\nrecurrence? A key role is played by the concept of \"periodic cluster mutation\",\nintroduced in 2009.\n  Each recurrence corresponds to a finite dimensional map.

This setup gives a\nsimple example of a situation where describing low-energy bulk physics in CFT\nlanguage requires knowledge of high-energy bulk physics. This contradicts to\nsome extent the notion of \"effective conformal field theory\", but in fact is an\nexpected feature of the resolution of the black hole information problem. An\nanalogous factorization issue exists also for the gravitational field, and I\ncomment on several of its implications for reconstructing black hole interiors\nand the emergence of spacetime more generally. \n\n"}

This \"Lagrangian fluctuation-dissipation relation\"\nequates the scalar dissipation for either passive or active scalars to the\nvariance of scalar inputs associated to initial scalar values and internal\nscalar sources, as those are sampled backward in time by the stochastic\nLagrangian trajectories. As an important application, we reconsider the\nphenomenon of \"Lagrangian spontaneous stochasticity\" or persistent\nnon-determinism of Lagrangian particle trajectories in the limit of vanishing\nviscosity and diffusivity. Previous work on the Kraichnan (1968) model of\nturbulent scalar advection has shown that anomalous scalar dissipation is\nassociated in that model to Lagrangian spontaneous stochasticity. There has\nbeen controversy, however, regarding the validity of this mechanism for scalars\nadvected by an actual turbulent flow.

This\nproperty holds for both continuous dynamical systems as well as for discrete\nones defined in discrete space-time.

In spite of the linearity, the MDC property is\nnon-trivial in terms of the parameters of the system.

Recently, a hydrodynamical description of\nOTOCs has emerged from considering random local circuits, aspects of which are\nconjectured to be universal to ergodic many-body systems, even without\nrandomness. Here we extend this approach to systems with locally conserved\nquantities (e.g., energy).

It is straightforward to see that\nthe power of the momentum in the integrand can be increased by $2$ in the\ninfrared using large gauge transformations, which are sufficient for rendering\nthese two-point functions infrared finite for slow-roll inflation. In other\nwords, if the integrand of the momentum integral for these two-point functions\nbehaves like $p^{-2\\nu}$, where $p$ is the momentum, in the infrared, then it\ncan be made to behave like $p^{-2\\nu+2}$ by large gauge transformations.

The method relies on defining the coboundary\noperator of the local Weyl group, and giving a cohomological interpretation to\ncounterterms in the effective action in dimensional regularization with respect\nto this group. Non-trivial cocycles of the Weyl group arise from local\nfunctionals that are Weyl invariant in and only in the physical even integer\ndimension. In the physical dimension the non-trivial cocycles generate\ncovariant non-local action functionals characterized by sensitivity to global\nWeyl rescalings. The non-local action so obtained is unique up to the addition\nof trivial cocycles and Weyl invariant terms, both of which are insensitive to\nglobal Weyl rescalings. These distinct behaviors under rigid dilations can be\nused to distinguish between infrared relevant and irrelevant operators in a\ngenerally covariant manner. Variation of the $d=4$ non-local effective action\nyields two new conserved geometric stress tensors with local traces.

The problem is that consistency\nwith long distance experiments requires the graviton mass to be very small.\nSuch a small graviton mass however implies an ultraviolet cutoff for the theory\nat length scales far larger than the millimeter scale at which gravity has\nalready been measured. In this paper we attempt to construct a model which\navoids this problem. We consider a brane world setup in warped AdS spacetime\nand we investigate the consequences of writing a mass term for the graviton on\na the infrared brane where the local cutoff is of order a large (galactic)\ndistance scale. The advantage of this setup is that the low cutoff for physics\non the infrared brane does not significantly affect the predictivity of the\ntheory for observers localized on the ultraviolet brane. For such observers the\npredictions of this theory agree with general relativity at distances smaller\nthan the infrared scale but go over to those of a theory of massive gravity at\nlonger distances. A careful analysis of the graviton two-point function,\nhowever, reveals the presence of a ghost in the low energy spectrum.

Our proof can be extended to a modified\nHamiltonian which only forbids at least $n$ particles from coming close\ntogether, for any fixed $n$. \n\n"}

The problem is that the angle is a multivalued or\ndiscontinuous variable on the corresponding phase space. The remedy is to\nreplace phi by the smooth periodic functions cos phi and sin phi. In the case\nof the canonical pair (phi,l),l: orbital angular momentum (OAM), the phase\nspace S_(phi,l) ={phi in R mod 2pi, l in R} has the global structure S^1 x R of\na cylinder on which the Poisson brackets of the 3 functions cos phi, sin phi\nand l obey the Lie algebra of the euclidean group E(2) in the plane. This\nproperty provides the basis for the quantization of the system in terms of\nirreducible unitary representations of the group E(2) or of its covering\ngroups. A crucial point is that - due to the fact that the subgroup SO(2) = S^1\nis multiply connected - these representations allow for fractional OAM l = n +\nc, c in [0,1). Such c not 0 have already been observed in cases like the\nAharonov-Bohm and the fractional quantum Hall effects and they correspond to\nthe quasi-momenta of Bloch waves in ideal crystals.

Abstract: We develop a systematic procedure of finding integrable ''relativistic''\n(regular one-parameter) deformations for integrable lattice systems. Our\nprocedure is based on the integrable time discretizations and consists of three\nsteps. First, for a given system one finds a local discretization living in the\nsame hierarchy. Second, one considers this discretization as a particular\nCauchy problem for a certain 2-dimensional lattice equation, and then looks for\nanother meaningful Cauchy problems, which can be, in turn, interpreted as new\ndiscrete time systems. Third, one has to identify integrable hierarchies to\nwhich these new discrete time systems belong. These novel hierarchies are\ncalled then ''relativistic'', the small time step $h$ playing the role of\ninverse speed of light. We apply this procedure to the Toda lattice (and\nrecover the well-known relativistic Toda lattice), as well as to the Volterra\nlattice and a certain Bogoyavlensky lattice, for which the ''relativistic''\ndeformations were not known previously. \n\n"}
