Some theoretical\nestimates for the cores of relaxed clusters predict an excess of helium\nabundance by up to a factor of a few over its primordial value. The\nintracluster helium abundance cannot be measured directly. This presents a\nsignificant source of uncertainty for cosmological tests based on the X-ray\nderived cluster quantities, such as the gas mass, total mass, and gas mass\nfraction, all of which depend on the assumed helium abundance. We point out\nthat cluster distances derived by combining the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) and\nX-ray data also depend on the helium abundance. This dependence can be used to\nmeasure the abundance, provided the distance is known independently. For\nexample, if one adopts the WMAP H_0 value, then the recent H_0 measurement by\nBonamente and collaborators, derived from SZ data on 38 clusters assuming a\nprimordial helium abundance, corresponds to an abundance excess by a factor of\n1.9+-0.8 within r~1 Mpc (using only their statistical errors). This shows that\ninteresting accuracy is within reach.

While past assessments were based on only the inspiral/ring-down\npieces of the coalescence signal, the recent progress in analytical and\nnumerical relativity enables us to make more accurate projections using\n\"complete\" inspiral-merger-ringdown waveforms. We employ the Fisher matrix\nformalism to estimate how accurately the source parameters will be measurable\nusing a single interferometer as well as a network of interferometers. Those\nestimates are further vetted by Monte-Carlo simulations. We find that the\nparameter accuracies of the complete waveform are, in general, significantly\nbetter than those of just the inspiral waveform in the case of binaries with\ntotal mass M > 20 M_sun. For the case of the Advanced LIGO detector, parameter\nestimation is the most accurate in the M=100-200 M_sun range.

Abstract: We investigate the effects of the presence of relic classical superhorizon\ninhomogeneities during inflation.

Quantum fluctuations on\nthis slightly inhomogeneous background are generally statistical anisotropic.\nWe find a quadrupole modification to the ordinary isotropic spectrum. Moreover,\nthis deviation from statistical isotropy is scale-dependent, with a $\\sim\n-1/k^2$ factor.

I analyze the stochastic effects introduced by\nthe sampling of the stellar initial mass function (SIMF) in the derivation of\nthe individual masses and the CMF and I establish that such effects are the\nlargest contributor to the observational uncertainties. An analytical solution,\nvalid in the limit where uncertainties are small, is provided to establish the\nrange of cluster masses over which the CMF slope can be obtained with a given\naccuracy. The validity of the analytical solution is extended to higher mass\nuncertainties using Monte Carlo simulations and the Gamma approximation. The\nvalue of the Poisson mass is calculated for a large range of ages and a variety\nof filters for solar-metallicity clusters measured with single-filter\nphotometry.

The only evidence that points to\npossible correlation between the supernova rate and star formation activity is\nthat the supernova rate in late-type galaxies is higher than that in early-type\ngalaxies by 31+/-35%. The sample contains 8 type Ia supernovae whose host\ngalaxies were not identified, but it is shown that their occurrence is\nconsistent with them occurred in low luminous galaxies beyond the survey. The\nluminosity function of type Ia supernovae is approximately Gaussian with the\nfull-width half maximum being a factor of 1.4 in luminosity. The Gaussian\ndistribution becomes tighter if the ratio of extinction to reddening, R_V, is\nlower than the characteristic value for the Milky Way and if luminosity is\ncorrected for the light curve shape. The colour excess is ~0.07 mag which is\nsignificantly smaller than reddening expected for field galaxies. This colour\nexcess does not vary with the distance of the supernovae from the centre of the\nhost galaxy to 15 kpc. This suggests that the major part of the colour excess\nappears to be either intrinsic or reddening that arises in the immediate\nenvironment of supernova, rather than interstellar reddening in host galaxies. \n\n"}

The S/N ratio is sufficiently high that we\ncan extend previous studies to smaller equivalent widths (typically Wr>0.3A).\nOver a pathlength of Delta(z)~14 the number of weak absorbers detected is\nsimilar along GRB and QSO lines of sight, while the number of strong systems is\nlarger along GRB lines of sight with a 2-sigma significance.

The HeII optical depth derived from the Lyman-alpha forest decreases\nsubstantially from this period to z ~ 2; moreover, it fluctuates strongly near\nz ~ 3 and then evolves smoothly at lower redshifts. From these opacities, we\ncompute, using a semi-analytic model, the evolution of the mean photoionization\nrate and the attenuation length for helium over the redshift range 2.0 < z <\n3.2. This model includes an inhomogeneous metagalactic radiation background,\nwhich is expected during and after helium reionization. We find that assuming a\nuniform background underestimates the required photoionization rate by up to a\nfactor ~2. When averaged over the (few) available lines of sight, the effective\noptical depth exhibits a discontinuity near z = 2.8, but the measurement\nuncertainties are sizable.

First, the\ndata support the conclusion that excess heating of the intracluster medium has\naltered its thermodynamic state from that expected in a simple, gravitationally\ndominated system; however, this excess heating is primarily limited to the\ncentral regions of clusters (r<0.15r_500).

Third, the evolution with redshift of the scaling\nrelations is consistent with the predictions of simple, self-similar models of\ngravitational collapse, indicating that the mechanism responsible for heating\nthe central regions of clusters was in operation before redshift 0.5 (the limit\nof our data) and that its effects on global cluster properties have not evolved\nstrongly since then. \n\n"}

Many proposals have been put forth to\nexplain these data, usually relying on a single particle to annihilate or decay\nto produce e+e-. In this paper, we consider models with multiple species of\nWIMPs with significantly different masses. We show if such dark matter\ncandidates chi_i annihilate into light bosons, they naturally produce equal\nannihilation rates, even as the available numbers of pairs for annihilation\nn_chi_i^2 differ by orders of magnitude. We argue that a consequence of these\nmodels can be to add additional signal naturally at lower (~100 GeV) versus\nhigher (~ TeV) energies, changing the expected spectrum and even adding bumps\nat lower energies, which may alleviate some of the tension in the required\nannihilation rates between PAMELA and Fermi. These spectral changes may yield\nobservable consequences in the microwave Haze signal observed at the upcoming\nPlanck satellite. Such a model can connect to other observable signals such as\nDAMA and INTEGRAL by having the lighter (heavier) state be a pseudo-Dirac\nfermion with splitting 100 keV (1 MeV). We show that variations in the halo\nvelocity dispersion can alleviate constraints from final state radiation in the\ngalactic center and galactic ridge.

The adaptive smoothing scheme allows to take full\nadvantage of the spatially resolved photometric information contained in an\nimage in that at any location the minimal smoothing is applied to reach the\nrequested S/N.

A statistical analysis of sources\naround unidentified SMGs identifies a population of likely counterparts with a\nredshift distribution peaking at z=2.5\\pm0.3, which likely comprises ~60% of\nthe unidentified SMGs. This confirms that the bulk of the undetected SMGs are\ncoeval with those detected in the radio/mid-IR.

In this model optical\nhalf-light radii are smaller, both at fixed stellar mass and maximum circular\nvelocity, at higher redshifts. This model also predicts that the scaling\nrelations between baryonic quantities evolve even more weakly than the\ncorresponding stellar relations.

We interpret the observed SEDs of 16 ULIRGs using\nthis physically-motivated model which accounts for the emission of stellar\npopulations from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared and for the attenuation\nby dust in two components: an optically-thick starburst component and the\ndiffuse ISM. The infrared emission is computed by assuming that all the energy\nabsorbed by dust in these components is re-radiated at mid- and far-infrared\nwavelengths. This model allows us to derive statistically physical properties\nincluding star formation rates, stellar masses, as well as temperatures and\nmasses of different dust components and plausible star formation histories. We\nfind that, although the ultraviolet to near-infrared emission represents only a\nsmall fraction of the total power radiated by ULIRGs, observations in this\nwavelength range are important to understand the properties of the stellar\npopulations and dust attenuation in the diffuse ISM of these galaxies.\nFurthermore, our analysis indicates that the use of mid-infrared spectroscopy\nfrom the Infrared Spectrograph on the Spitzer Space Telescope is crucial to\nobtain realistic estimates of the extinction to the central energy source,\nmainly via the depth of the 9.7-micron silicate feature, and thus accurately\nconstrain the total energy balance.

In this study we focus on understanding the\nmatter clustering at several redshifts. The primordial non-Gaussianity is\nmodeled as a quadratic correction to the local Gaussian potential, and is\ncharacterized by the parameter f_NL. In our formulation of the halo model we\npay special attention to the effect of halo exclusion, and show that this can\npotentially solve the long standing problem of excess power on large scales in\nthis model. The model depends on the mass function, clustering and density\nprofiles of halos. We test these ingredients using a large ensemble of\nhigh-resolution Gaussian and non-Gaussian numerical simulations. In particular,\nwe provide a first exploration of how density profiles change in the presence\nof primordial non-Gaussianities. We find that for f_NL positive/negative high\nmass halos have an increased/decreased core density, so being more/less\nconcentrated than in the Gaussian case. We also examine the halo bias and show\nthat, if the halo model is correct, then there is a small asymmetry in the\nscale-dependence of the bias on very large scales, which arises because the\nGaussian bias must be renormalized.

Using toy\ntemperature models and detailed heating histories from cosmological simulations\nof HeII reionization, we study the consequences of inhomogeneous heating for\nthe Ly-alpha forest. The impact of temperature fluctuations in physically\nwell-motivated models can be surprisingly subtle. In fact, we show that\ntemperature fluctuations at the level predicted by our reionization simulations\ndo not give rise to detectable signatures in the types of statistics that have\nbeen employed previously. However, because of the aliasing of small-scale\ndensity power to larger scale modes in the line-of-sight Ly-alpha forest power\nspectrum, earlier analyses were not sensitive to 3D modes with >~ 30 comoving\nMpc wavelengths -- scales where temperature fluctuations are likely to be\nrelatively largest.

The approach employs a\ndirect discretisation of the radiative transfer equation in Boltzmann form with\nadjustable angular resolution that in principle works equally well in the\noptically thin and optically thick regimes. In our most general formulation of\nthe scheme, the local radiation field is decomposed into a linear sum of\ndirectional bins of equal solid-angle, tessellating the unit sphere. Each of\nthese \"cone-fields\" is transported independently, with constant intensity as a\nfunction of direction within the cone. Photons propagate at the speed of light\n(or optionally using a reduced speed of light approximation to allow larger\ntimesteps), yielding a fully time-dependent solution of the radiative transfer\nequation that can naturally cope with an arbitrary number of sources, as well\nas with scattering. The method casts sharp shadows, subject to the limitations\ninduced by the adopted angular resolution. If the number of point sources is\nsmall and scattering is unimportant, our implementation can alternatively treat\neach source exactly in angular space, producing shadows whose sharpness is only\nlimited by the grid resolution. A third hybrid alternative is to treat only a\nsmall number of the locally most luminous point sources explicitly, with the\nrest of the radiation intensity followed in a radiative diffusion\napproximation.

At large separations, the tidal effect of the\nsecondary CO clears a gap. We show that the gap refills during the late\nGW-driven phase of the inspiral, leading to a sudden EM brightening of the\nsource. The accretion disk leaves an imprint on the GW through its angular\nmomentum exchange with the binary, the mass increase of the binary members due\nto accretion, and its gravity. We compute the disk-modified GWs both in an\nanalytical Newtonian approximation and in a numerical effective-one-body\napproach.

Typically, training sets are derived from historical surveys of\nbrighter, more nearby objects than those from more extensive, deeper surveys\n(testing data). This sample selection bias can cause catastrophic errors in\npredictions on the testing data because a) standard assumptions for\nmachine-learned model selection procedures break down and b) dense regions of\ntesting space might be completely devoid of training data. We explore possible\nremedies to sample selection bias, including importance weighting (IW),\nco-training (CT), and active learning (AL). We argue that AL---where the data\nwhose inclusion in the training set would most improve predictions on the\ntesting set are queried for manual follow-up---is an effective approach and is\nappropriate for many astronomical applications. For a variable star\nclassification problem on a well-studied set of stars from Hipparcos and OGLE,\nAL is the optimal method in terms of error rate on the testing data, beating\nthe off-the-shelf classifier by 3.4% and the other proposed methods by at least\n3.0%.

We find a general\nevolution of magnetic fields: for weak interactions the strength of magnetic\nfield is almost constant (10-15muG) as interaction advances, then it increases\nup to 2x, peaks at the nuclear coalescence (25muG), and decreases again, down\nto 5-6muG, for the post-merger remnants. The magnetic field strength for whole\ngalaxies is weakly affected by the star formation rate (SFR), while the\ndependence is higher for galactic centres. We show that the morphological\ndistortions visible in the radio total and polarized emission do not depend\nstatistically on the global or local SFRs, while they do increase with the\nadvance of interaction.

In a matching\nsample of GADGET and AREPO haloes we fit simulated gas disks with exponential\nprofiles. We find that the cold gas disks formed using the moving mesh approach\nhave systematically larger disk scale lengths and higher specific angular\nmomenta than their GADGET counterparts across a wide range in halo masses. For\nlow mass galaxies differences between the properties of the simulated galaxy\ndisks are caused by an insufficient number of resolution elements which lead to\nthe artificial angular momentum transfer in our SPH calculation.

Most of the individual\nspectra are drawn from our ongoing survey in the GOODS fields with the Keck\nDEIMOS spectrograph, and we have augmented our sample with published data taken\nwith FORS2 on the VLT. In general we find similar trends in the spectral\ndiagnostics to those found in the earlier, more extensive survey of LBGs at z=3\nundertaken by Shapley et al (2003). Specifically, we find low-ionization\nabsorption lines which trace the presence of neutral outflowing gas are weaker\nin galaxies with stronger Lyman-alpha emission, bluer UV spectral slopes, lower\nstellar masses, lower UV luminosities and smaller half-light radii. This is\nconsistent with a physical picture whereby star formation drives outflows of\nneutral gas which scatters Lyman-alpha and gives rise to strong low-ionization\nabsorption lines, while increasing the stellar mass, size, metallicity, and\ndust content of galaxies. Typical galaxies are thus expected to have stronger\nLyman-alpha emission and weaker low-ionization absorption at earlier times\n(higher redshifts).

In\nshort, one just need to formalize, using maths, the logical link between the\ninvolved quantities, how the data arise and what we already known on the\nquantities we want to study. The posterior probability distribution summarizes\nwhat we known on the studied quantities after the data, and we should not be\nafraid about their actual numerical computation, because it is left to\n(special) Monte Carlo programs such as JAGS. As examples, we show how to\npredict the mass of a new object disposing of a calibrating sample, how to\nconstraint cosmological parameters from supernovae data and how to check if the\nfitted data are in tension with the adopted fitting model. Examples are given\nwith their coding. These examples can be easily used as template for completely\ndifferent analysis, on totally unrelated astronomical objects, requiring to\nmodel the same awkward data features. \n\n"}

We find that at redshift ~2 the\npopulation of galaxies with M_*> 2 10^10 Msun is diverse in terms of mass,\nvelocity dispersion, star formation and effective radius, containing both very\ncompact and relatively extended objects. In each simulation all the compact\nsatellite galaxies have merged into the central galaxy by redshift 0 (with the\nexception of one simulation where one of such satellite galaxy survives).\nSatellites of similar mass at z = 0 are all less compact than their high\nredshift counterparts. They form later than the galaxies in the z = 2 sample\nand enter the group potential at z < 1, when dynamical friction times are\nlonger than the Hubble time. Also, by z = 0 the central galaxies have increased\nsubstantially their characteristic radius via a combination of in situ star\nformation and mergers.

We find the\npseudo-equivalent width (pEW) of the Si II 4000 line to be a good indicator of\nlight-curve width, and the pEWs of the Mg II and Fe II complexes are relatively\ngood proxies for SN colour.

The\nresiduals from these models are then compared to the standard model which uses\nonly light-curve stretch and colour. Our investigations show that a distance\nmodel that uses x_1, c, and the velocity of the Si II 6355 feature does not\nlead to a decrease in the Hubble residuals.

The observed\nblack hole-to-bulge mass ratios of NGC4342 and NGC4291 are ~6.9% and ~1.9%,\nrespectively, which significantly exceed the typical observed ratio of ~0.2%.\nAs a consequence of the exceedingly large black hole-to-bulge mass ratios,\nNGC4342 and NGC4291 are ~5.1 sigma and ~3.4 sigma outliers from the M_BH -\nM_bulge scaling relation, respectively. In this paper, we explore the origin of\nthe unusually high black hole-to-bulge mass ratio. Based on Chandra X-ray\nobservations of the hot gas content of NGC4342 and NGC4291, we compute\ngravitating mass profiles, and conclude that both galaxies reside in massive\ndark matter halos, which extend well beyond the stellar light. The presence of\ndark matter halos around NGC4342 and NGC4291 and a deep optical image of the\nenvironment of NGC4342 indicate that tidal stripping, in which >90% of the\nstellar mass was lost, cannot explain the observed high black hole-to-bulge\nmass ratios.

This\never-present and pernicious uncertainty is often the Achilles' heel in\ncosmological studies and must be reduced if we are to see the advent of\nprecision cosmology in the late-time Universe. We show that an optimally\ntrained artificial neural network (ANN), when presented with a set of\ncosmological parameters (Omega_m h^2, Omega_b h^2, n_s, w_0, sigma_8, m_nu and\nredshift z), can provide a worst-case error <=1 per cent (for z<=2) fit to the\nnon-linear matter power spectrum deduced through N-body simulations, for modes\nup to k<=0.7 h/Mpc. Our power spectrum interpolator is accurate over the entire\nparameter space. This is a significant improvement over some of the current\nmatter power spectrum calculators.

The MLPQNA model\nhas been applied on the whole PHAT1 dataset of 1984 objects after an\noptimization of the model performed by using as training set the 515 available\nspectroscopic redshifts. When applied to the PHAT1 dataset, MLPQNA obtains the\nbest bias accuracy (0.0006) and very competitive accuracies in terms of scatter\n(0.056) and outlier percentage (16.3%), scoring as the second most effective\nempirical method among those which have so far participated to the contest.\nMLPQNA shows better generalization capabilities than most other empirical\nmethods especially in presence of underpopulated regions of the Knowledge Base. \n\n"}

Combining our Halpha measurements of 854 galaxies at\n0.8<z<1.5 with those of ground based surveys at lower and higher redshift, we\ncan consistently determine the evolution of the EW(Halpha) distribution from\nz=0 to z=2.2. We find that at all masses the characteristic EW(Halpha) is\ndecreasing towards the present epoch, and that at each redshift the EW(Halpha)\nis lower for high-mass galaxies. We measure a slope of EW(Halpha) ~ (1+z)^(1.8)\nwith little mass dependence. Qualitatively, this measurement is a\nmodel-independent confirmation of the evolution of star forming galaxies with\nredshift. A quantitative conversion of EW(Halpha) to sSFR is very model\ndependent, because of differential reddening corrections between the continuum\nSED and the Balmer lines. The observed EW(Halpha) can be reproduced with a\nsimple model in which the SFR for galaxies rises to the epoch of z~2.5 and then\ndecreases with time to z = 0. The model implies that the EW(Halpha) rises to\n400 A at z=8. The sSFR evolves faster than EW(Halpha), as the mass-to-light\nratio also evolves with redshift. In this context, we find that the sSFR\nevolves as (1+z)^(3.2), nearly independent of mass, consistent with previous\nreddening insensitive estimates. We confirm previous results that the observed\nslope of the sSFR-z relation is steeper than the one predicted by models, but\nmodels and observations agree in finding little mass dependence. \n\n"}

We investigate photometric\nclassification techniques on stars and galaxies with intrinsic FWHM < 0.2\narcsec. We consider unsupervised spectral energy distribution template fitting\nand supervised, data-driven Support Vector Machines (SVM). For template\nfitting, we use a Maximum Likelihood (ML) method and a new Hierarchical\nBayesian (HB) method, which learns the prior distribution of template\nprobabilities from the data. SVM requires training data to classify unknown\nsources; ML and HB don't. We consider i.) a best-case scenario (SVM_best) where\nthe training data is (unrealistically) a random sampling of the data in both\nsignal-to-noise and demographics, and ii.) a more realistic scenario where\ntraining is done on higher signal-to-noise data (SVM_real) at brighter apparent\nmagnitudes.

The second uses a Monte Carlo\napproach incorporating methods that greatly improve the accuracy compared with\nprevious approaches in this context.

This method avoids known star formation and chemical enrichment\nproblems encountered in simulations. Here we focus on the Milky Way, by using a\ndetailed thin-disk chemical evolution model and a simulation in the\ncosmological context, with dynamical properties close to those of our Galaxy.\nWe show that, due to radial migration from mergers at high redshift and the\ncentral bar at later times, a sizable fraction of old metal-poor\nhigh-[alpha/Fe] stars reaches the solar vicinity. This naturally accounts for a\nnumber of recent observations related to both the thin and thick disks, despite\nthe fact that we use thin-disk chemistry only. Although significant radial\nmixing is present, the slope in the age-metallicity relation is only weakly\naffected, with a scatter compatible with recent observational work.

We find that the offsets between\nthe BCG and the peak of the smoothed light map representing the DM, \\Delta, are\ndistributed equally around zero with no preferred direction, and are well\ndescribed by a log-normal distribution with <log_{10}(\\Delta [h^{-1}\nMpc])>=-1.895^{+0.003}_{-0.004}, and \\sigma=0.501\\pm0.004 (95% confidence\nlevels), or <log_{10}(\\Delta [\\arcsec])>=0.564\\pm0.005, and\n\\sigma=0.475\\pm0.007. Some of the offsets originate in prior misidentifications\nof the BCG or other bright cluster members by the cluster finding algorithm,\nwhose level we make an additional effort to assess, finding that ~10% of the\nclusters in the probed catalogue are likely to be misidentified, contributing\nto higher-end offsets in general agreement with previous studies. Our results\nconstitute the first statistically-significant high-resolution distributions of\nDM-to-BCG offsets obtained in an observational analysis, and importantly show\nthat there exists such a typical non-zero offset in the probed catalogue. The\noffsets show a weak positive correlation with redshift, so that higher\nseparations are generally found for higher-z clusters in agreement with the\nhierarchical growth of structure, which in turn could help characterise the\nmerger, relaxation and evolution history of clusters, in future studies.\n[ABRIDGED] \n\n"}

A generic prediction of inflation is odd-parity (B-mode)\npolarization in the cosmic microwave background (CMB).

Moreover we take into account H_2 non-equilibrium\nchemistry, including photo-dissociation. The most striking feature of the\nsimulations is a high spatial resolution for the radiative transfer (RT)\ncalculation which enables us to start considering not only external UV feedback\nprocesses but also internal UV feedback processes in each galaxy. We find that\nthe star formation is significantly suppressed due to the internal UV and\nsupernova (SN) feedback. In low mass galaxies with M<10^9Msun, a large amount\nof gas is evacuated by photo-evaporation as previous studies have shown, which\nresults in the suppression of star formation. Surprisingly, star formation in\nmassive halos is also strongly suppressed despite the fact that these halos\nhardly lose any gas by photo-evaporation. The suppression of star formation in\nmassive halos is mainly caused by following two factors; (i) small scale clumpy\nstructures in the galaxies are smoothened by the internal feedback, (ii)\nalthough the dense gas in the galaxies is mostly neutral, the H_2 formation and\ncooling processes are disturbed by mild photo-heating. Photo-dissociating\nradiations actually suppress star formation, but the magnitude of the effect is\nnot so large in massive galaxies.

The\naverage blueshift of the FeII interstellar absorption lines with respect to the\nsystemic velocity is -85+/-10 km/s at z~1.5, with standard deviation 87 km/s;\nthis is a decrease of a factor of two from the average blueshift measured for\nfar-UV interstellar absorption lines in similarly selected galaxies at z~2. The\nprofiles of the MgII 2796, 2803 lines show much more variety than the FeII\nprofiles, which are always seen in absorption; MgII ranges from strong emission\nto pure absorption, with emission more common in galaxies with blue UV slopes\nand at lower stellar masses. Outflow velocities, as traced by the centroids and\nmaximum extent of the absorption lines, increase with increasing stellar mass\nwith 2-3sigma significance, in agreement with previous results.

The sample\nincludes galaxies both on and above the main sequence (MS) traced by\nstar-forming galaxies in the SFR-M* plane. The far-infrared data are used to\nderive dust masses, Mdust. Combined with an empirical prescription for the\ndependence of the gas-to-dust ratio on metallicity (GDR), the CO luminosities\nand Mdust values are used to derive for each galaxy the CO-to-H2 conversion\nfactor, alpha_co. Like in the local Universe, the value of alpha_co is a factor\nof ~5 smaller in starbursts compared to normal star-forming galaxies (SFGs). We\nalso uncover a relation between alpha_co and dust temperature (Tdust; alpha_co\ndecreasing with increasing Tdust) as obtained from modified blackbody fits to\nthe far-infrared data. While the absolute normalization of the alpha_co(Tdust)\nrelation is uncertain, the global trend is robust against possible systematic\nbiases in the determination of Mdust, GDR or metallicity. Although we cannot\nformally distinguish between a step and a smooth evolution of alpha_co with the\ndust temperature, we can conclude that in galaxies of near-solar metallicity, a\ncritical value of Tdust=30K can be used to determine whether the appropriate\nalpha_co is closer to the starburst value (1.0 Msun(K kms pc^2)^-1, if\nTdust>30K) or closer to the Galactic value (4.35 Msun (K kms pc^2)^-1, if\nTdust<30K). This indicator has the great advantage of being less subjective\nthan visual morphological classifications of mergers/SFGs, which can be\ndifficult at high z because of the clumpy nature of SFGs. In the absence of\nfar-infrared data, the offset of a galaxy from the main sequence (i.e.,\nlog[SSFR(galaxy)/SSFR_MS(M*,z)]) can be used to identify galaxies requiring the\nuse of an alpha_co conversion factor lower than the Galactic value. \n\n"}

The simple linear model we use fails at\nseparations r < 15 Mpc/h, and we show that this may reasonably be due to the\nenhanced ionization due to radiation from the quasars.

This data set allows\nsimultaneous observations of resolved stars and NIR surface brightness across\nM31's entire bulge and disk (within R=22 kpc). The primary concern of this work\nis the development of NIR observation and reduction methods to recover a\nuniform surface brightness map across the 3x1 degree disk of M31. This\nnecessitates sky-target nodding across 27 WIRCam fields. Two sky-target nodding\nstrategies were tested, and we find that strictly minimizing sky sampling\nlatency does not maximize sky subtraction accuracy, which is at best 2% of the\nsky level. The mean surface brightness difference between blocks in our mosaic\ncan be reduced from 1% to 0.1% of the sky brightness by introducing scalar sky\noffsets to each image. The true surface brightness of M31 can be known to\nwithin a statistical zeropoint of 0.15% of the sky level (0.2 mag arcsec sq.\nuncertainty at R=15 kpc). Surface brightness stability across individual WIRCam\nframes is limited by both WIRCam flat field evolution and residual sky\nbackground shapes. To overcome flat field variability of order 1% over 30\nminutes, we find that WIRCam data should be calibrated with real-time sky\nflats.

Recent measurements of the CMB at large\nmultipoles made by the Planck satellite and high-l experiments are critical for\nprobing this physics. Within the context of conventional LambdaCDM parameters\ncosmological data are compatible with G_eff < 1/(56 MeV)^2 and neutrino\nfree-streaming might be delayed until their temperature has cooled to as low as\n~25 eV.

This regime can\ndominate at BH binary separations of a few tens of parsecs and below, following\na phase of orbital circularization dominated by local dynamical friction.

These findings are\nconsistent with the notion that elliptical galaxies formed via mergers which\npredominantly occurred along the filaments. The spin axis of spiral galaxies is\nfound to align with the host filament, with no correlation between spiral spin\nand sheet normal. When examined as a function of distance from the filament\naxis, a much stronger correlation is found in outer parts, suggesting that the\nalignment is driven by the laminar infall of gas from sheets to filaments. When\ncompared with numerical simulations our results suggest that the connection\nbetween DM halo and galaxy spin is not straightforward. Our results provide an\nimportant input to the understanding of how galaxies acquire their angular\nmomentum. \n\n"}

This measurement requires\nextremely precise estimation of very small galaxy shape distortions, in the\npresence of far larger intrinsic galaxy shapes and distortions due to the\nblurring kernel caused by the atmosphere, telescope optics, and instrumental\neffects.

The photometry used includes U-band through mid-infrared filters and\nwas derived using the TFIT method. Comparing the results, we find that there is\nno particular code or set of template SEDs that results in significantly better\nphotometric redshifts compared to others. However, we find codes producing the\nlowest scatter and outlier fraction utilize a training sample to optimize\nphotometric redshifts by adding zero-point offsets, template adjusting or\nadding extra smoothing errors. These results therefore stress the importance of\nthe training procedure. We find a strong dependence of the photometric redshift\naccuracy on the signal-to-noise ratio of the photometry. On the other hand, we\nfind a weak dependence of the photometric redshift scatter with redshift and\ngalaxy color. We find that most photometric redshift codes quote redshift\nerrors (e.g., 68% confidence intervals) that are too small compared to that\nexpected from the spectroscopic control sample. We find that all codes show a\nstatistically significant bias in the photometric redshifts. However, the bias\nis in all cases smaller than the scatter, the latter therefore dominates the\nerrors. Finally, we find that combining results from multiple codes\nsignificantly decreases the photometric redshift scatter and outlier fraction.\nWe discuss different ways of combining data to produce accurate photometric\nredshifts and error estimates. \n\n"}

Intergalactic absorption along this\nsightline shows that the helium Gunn-Peterson trough is largely black in the\nrange $2.87 < z < 3.20$, apart from ionization due to local sources, indicating\nthat helium reionization has not completed at these redshifts.

A\ndelay of 170 days between the radio and $\\gamma$-ray flares was revealed using\nthe Discrete Correlation Function (DCF) that can be interpreted in the context\nof a shock model, in which each flare corresponds to the formation of a compact\nsuperluminal component that expands and becomes optically thin at radio\nfrequencies at latter epochs.

Unlike some previous works where non-diagonal\nelements of the covariance matrix were neglected, we use the full covariance\nmatrix of the SNIa data, thus obtaining more realistic and not underestimated\nerrors. As a matter of fact, the significance of previously claimed detections\nof a preferred direction in the Union2 dataset completely disappears once we\ninclude the effects of using the full covariance matrix. Moreover, we also find\nthat such a a preferred direction is aligned with the orthogonal direction of\nthe SDSS observational plane and this suggests a clear indication that the SDSS\nsubsample of the Union2 dataset introduces a significant biased, making the\ndetected preferred direction unphysical.

It is\nthese features that make the minimisation of statistical and systematic errors\na perpetual challenge. In all these projects, the environment is turned into a\ndetector medium or a target. The atmosphere is probably the environment\ncomponent the most common in astroparticle physics and requires a continuous\nmonitoring of its properties to minimise as much as possible the systematic\nuncertainties associated. This paper introduces the different atmospheric\neffects to take into account in astroparticle physics measurements and provides\na non-exhaustive list of techniques and instruments to monitor the different\nelements composing the atmosphere. A discussion on the close link between\nastroparticle physics and Earth sciences ends this paper. \n\n"}

Based on the current test data of signal to noise\nratio of about 32, we find that: (1) When only one Faraday thin component is\npresent, most methods perform as expected, with occasional failures where two\ncomponents are incorrectly found; (2) For two Faraday thin components,\nQU-fitting routines perform the best, with errors close to the theoretical ones\nfor RMwtd, but with significantly higher errors for $\\Delta\\phi$.

The\ndata from the entire 2.5 year HFI mission include almost five independent\nfull-sky surveys. HFI observes the sky over a broad range of frequencies, from\n100 to 857 GHz. To obtain the best accuracy on the calibration over such a\nlarge range, two different photometric calibration schemes have been used. The\n545 and 857 GHz data are calibrated using models of planetary atmospheric\nemission. The lower frequencies (from 100 to 353 GHz) are calibrated using the\ntime-variable cosmological microwave background dipole, which we call the\n\"orbital dipole\". This source of calibration only depends on the satellite\nvelocity with respect to the solar system. Using a CMB temperature of 2.7255\n+/- 0.0006 K, it permits an independent measurement of the amplitude of the CMB\nsolar dipole (3364.3 +/- 1.5 \\mu K) which is approximatively 1\\sigma\\ higher\nthan the WMAP measurement with a direction that is consistent between both\nexperiments.

These models provide excellent\nfits to the observed data, with rms temperature residuals smaller than 4 uK\nover 93% of the sky for all Planck frequencies up to 353 GHz, and fractional\nerrors smaller than 1% in the remaining 7% of the sky.

We demonstrate\ninterferometric measurements are inherently sensitive to all scales, including\nthe largest angular scales, owing to the nature of wide-field measurements.\nThese wide-field effects are generic to all observations but antenna shapes\nimpact their amplitudes substantially. A dish-shaped antenna yields the most\ndesirable features from a foreground contamination viewpoint, relative to a\ndipole or a phased array.

The escaping photons mostly come from populations between\n3-10 Myr, whose birth clouds have been largely cleared by stellar feedback.\nHowever, these populations only contribute a small fraction of intrinsic\nionizing photon budgets according to standard stellar population models. We\nshow that fesc can be boosted to high values, if stellar populations older than\n3 Myr produce more ionizing photons than standard stellar population models (as\nmotivated by, e.g., models including binaries).

While the local model predicts this spatial modulation to be\nscale-independent, many variants have some scale-dependence. Here we note that\nthis scale dependence can be probed with measurements of frequency-spectrum\ndistortions in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), in particular\nhighlighting Compton-$y$ distortions.

With the recent polarization data of BICEP2 and the\njoint analysis data of BICEP2/Keck Array and Planck, we perform a global\nfitting analysis on constraining the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ by considering\nthe polarization rotation angle which can be separated into a background\nisotropic part and a small anisotropic part.

By training the algorithm using one field (Abell 2744) and applying\nthe result to another (MACS0416.1-2403), we show how the algorithm can cleanly\nseparate image features that a human would associate with early and late type\ngalaxies. We suggest that the algorithm has potential as a tool in the\nautomatic analysis and data mining of next-generation imaging and spectral\nsurveys, and could also find application beyond astronomy. \n\n"}

The Second Planck Catalogue of Compact\n  Sources Abstract: The Second Planck Catalogue of Compact Sources is a catalogue of sources\ndetected in single-frequency maps from the full duration of the Planck mission\nand supersedes previous versions of the Planck compact source catalogues. It\nconsists of compact sources, both Galactic and extragalactic, detected over the\nentire sky. Compact sources detected in the lower frequency channels are\nassigned to the PCCS2, while at higher frequencies they are assigned to one of\ntwo sub-catalogues, the PCCS2 or PCCS2E, depending on their location on the\nsky. The first of these catalogues covers most of the sky and allows the user\nto produce subsamples at higher reliabilities than the target 80% integral\nreliability of the catalogue. The PCCS2E contains sources detected in sky\nregions where the diffuse emission makes it difficult to quantify the\nreliability of the detections. Both the PCCS2 and PCCS2E include polarization\nmeasurements, in the form of polarized flux densities, or upper limits, and\norientation angles for all seven polarization-sensitive Planck channels.

We use the Illustris Simulation to investigate the role of assembly\nbias in producing galactic conformity by considering 18,000 galaxies with\n$M_{stellar}$ > $2 \\times 10^9$ $M_{\\odot}$. We find a significant signal of\ngalactic conformity: out to distances of about 10 Mpc, the mean red fraction of\ngalaxies around redder galaxies is higher than around bluer galaxies at fixed\nstellar mass. Dark matter haloes exhibit an analogous conformity signal, in\nwhich the fraction of haloes formed at earlier times (old haloes) is higher\naround old haloes than around younger ones at fixed halo mass. A plausible\ninterpretation of galactic conformity can be given as a combination of the halo\nconformity signal with the galaxy color-halo age relation: at fixed stellar\nmass, particularly toward the low-mass end, Illustris' galaxy colors correlate\nwith halo age, with the reddest galaxies (often satellites) being\npreferentially found in the oldest haloes. In fact, we can explain the galactic\nconformity effect with a simple semi-empirical model, by assigning stellar mass\nbased on halo mass (abundance matching) and by assigning galaxy color based on\nhalo age (age matching). We investigate other interpretations for the galactic\nconformity, particularly its dependence on the isolation criterion and on the\ncentral-satellite information. Regarding comparison to observations, we\nconclude that the adopted selection/isolation criteria, projection effects, and\nstacking techniques can have a significant impact on the measured amplitude of\nthe conformity signal. \n\n"}

We consider the case of surveys for high-redshift\nLyman-alpha-emitting galaxies (LAEs), which have traditionally been classified\nvia an inferred rest-frame equivalent width (EW) greater than 20 angstrom. Our\nBayesian method relies on known prior probabilities in measured emission-line\nluminosity functions and equivalent width distributions for the galaxy\npopulations, and returns the probability that an object in question is an LAE\ngiven the characteristics observed. This approach will be directly relevant for\nthe Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX), which seeks to\nclassify ~10^6 emission-line galaxies into LAEs and low-redshift [O II]\nemitters. For a simulated HETDEX catalog with realistic measurement noise, our\nBayesian method recovers 86% of LAEs missed by the traditional EW > 20 angstrom\ncutoff over 2 < z < 3, outperforming the EW cut in both contamination and\nincompleteness. This is due to the method's ability to trade off between the\ntwo types of binary classification error by adjusting the stringency of the\nprobability requirement for classifying an observed object as an LAE. In our\nsimulations of HETDEX, this method reduces the uncertainty in cosmological\ndistance measurements by 14% with respect to the EW cut, equivalent to\nrecovering 29% more cosmological information.

The simulations support\nour analytical finding that the error on the size of the PSF is a function of\nthe multiple stars distribution and of the intrinsic value of the size of the\nPSF, i.e. if all stars were single. Similarly, the modification of each of the\ncomplex ellipticity components (e1,e2) depends on the distribution of multiple\nstars and on the intrinsic complex ellipticity.

In this work\nwe show that in the very common situation where the number and position of the\nsearched signals within a data sequence (e.g. an emission line in a spectrum)\nor an image (e.g. a point-source in an interferometric map) are unknown, this\ntechnique, when applied in its standard form, may severely underestimate the\nprobability of false detection. This is because the correct use of the MF\nrelies upon a-priori knowledge of the position of the signal of interest. In\nthe absence of this information, the statistical significance of features that\nare actually noise is overestimated and detections claimed that are actually\nspurious. For this reason, we present an alternative method of computing the\nprobability of false detection that is based on the probability density\nfunction (PDF) of the peaks of a random field. It is able to provide a correct\nestimate of the probability of false detection for the one-, two- and\nthree-dimensional case.

Our model constructs a\npiecewise constant representation (effectively a histogram) of the distribution\nof galaxy types and redshifts, the parameters of which are efficiently inferred\nfrom noisy photometric flux measurements.

We oppose this opinion\nand show that two main factors are responsible for the extremely low intensity\nof the observed stellar EBL: (1) a low mean surface brightness of galaxies,\nwhich causes a low luminosity density in the local Universe, and (2) light\nextinction due to absorption by galactic and intergalactic dust. Dust produces\na partial opacity of galaxies and of the Universe. The galactic opacity reduces\nthe intensity of light from more distant background galaxies obscured by\nforeground galaxies. The effective extinction AV for light passing through a\ngalaxy is 0.2 mag. This causes that distant background galaxies do not\ncontribute to the EBL significantly. In addition, light of distant galaxies is\ndimmed due to absorption by intergalactic dust. Even a minute intergalactic\nopacity of 1x10^(-2) mag per Gpc is high enough to produce significant effects\non the EBL. The absorbed starlight heats up the galactic and intergalactic dust\nand is further re-radiated at the IR, FIR and micro-wave spectrum. Assuming\nstatic infinite universe with no galactic and intergalactic dust, the stellar\nEBL should be as high as the surface brightness of stars. However, if dust is\nconsidered, the predicted stellar EBL is about 290 nWm^(-2)sr^(-1), which is\nonly 5 times higher than the observed value. Hence, the presence of dust has\nhigher impact on the EBL than currently assumed. In the expanding universe, the\ncalculated value of the EBL is further decreased, because the obscuration\neffect and intergalactic absorption become more pronounced at high redshifts\nwhen the matter was concentrated at smaller volume than at present. \n\n"}

We show\nthat spurious haloes are a feature of traditional N-body simulations of\ncosmological structure formation models, including WDM and Cold Dark Matter\n(CDM) models, in which gravitational collapse proceeds in an initially\nanisotropic fashion, and arises naturally as a consequence of\ndiscreteness-driven relaxation. We demonstrate this using controlled N-body\nsimulations of plane-symmetric collapse and show that spurious haloes are\nseeded at shell crossing by localised velocity perturbations induced by the\ndiscrete nature of the density field, and that their characteristic separation\nshould be approximately the mean inter-particle separation of the N-body\nsimulation, which is fixed by the mass resolution within the volume.

Based on the singular isothermal\nellipsoid (SIE) model of SGL system, we obtain that the constrained curvature\nparameter $\\Omega_{\\rm k}$ is close to zero from the SGL data, which is\nconsistent with the latest result of planck measurement. More interestingly, we\nfind that the parameter $f$ in the SIE model is strongly correlated with the\ncurvature $\\Omega_{\\rm k}$. Neglecting this correlation in the analysis will\nsignificantly overestimate the constraining power of SGL data on the curvature.\nFurthermore, the obtained constraint on $f$ is different from previous results:\n$f=1.105\\pm0.030$ ($68\\%$ C.L.), which means that the standard singular\nisothermal sphere (SIS) model ($f=1$) is disfavored by the current SGL data at\nmore than $3\\sigma$ confidence level.

When the sound speed is\nsmall, the curvature perturbation is enhanced, and the tensor-to-scalar ratio,\nwhich is excessively large in the original model, can be sufficiently\nsuppressed to be consistent with observational bounds. Then, we study the\nprimordial three-point correlation function generated during the\nmatter-dominated contraction stage and find that it only depends on the sound\nspeed parameter. Similar to the canonical case, the shape of the bispectrum is\nmainly dominated by a local form, though for some specific sound speed values a\nnew shape emerges and the scaling behaviour changes. Meanwhile, a small sound\nspeed also results in a large amplitude of non-Gaussianities, which is\ndisfavored by current observations. As a result, it does not seem possible to\nsuppress the tensor-to-scalar ratio without amplifying the production of\nnon-Gaussianities beyond current observational constraints (and vice versa).\nThis suggests an extension of the previously conjectured no-go theorem in\nsingle field nonsingular matter bounce cosmologies, which rules out a large\nclass of models.

With a CRHWP, single detectors can measure\nthree of the Stokes parameters, $I$, $Q$ and $U$, thereby avoiding the set of\nsystematic errors that can be introduced by mismatches in the properties of\northogonal detector pairs. We focus on the implementation of CRHWPs in large\naperture telescopes (i.e. the primary mirror is larger than the current maximum\nhalf-wave plate diameter of $\\sim$0.5 m), where the CRHWP can be placed between\nthe primary mirror and focal plane. In this configuration, one needs to address\nthe intensity to polarization ($I{\\rightarrow}P$) leakage of the optics, which\nbecomes a source of 1/f noise and also causes differential gain systematics\nthat arise from CMB temperature fluctuations. In this paper, we present the\nperformance of a CRHWP installed in the POLARBEAR experiment, which employs a\nGregorian telescope with a 2.5 m primary illumination pattern. The CRHWP is\nplaced near the prime focus between the primary and secondary mirrors. We find\nthat the $I{\\rightarrow}P$ leakage is larger than the expectation from the\nphysical properties of our primary mirror, resulting in a 1/f knee of 100 mHz.\nThe excess leakage could be due to imperfections in the detector system, i.e.\ndetector non-linearity in the responsivity and time-constant. We demonstrate,\nhowever, that by subtracting the leakage correlated with the intensity signal,\nthe 1/f noise knee frequency is reduced to 32 mHz ($\\ell \\sim$39 for our scan\nstrategy), which is very promising to probe the primordial B-mode signal.

This is because the model itself\ncontains additional new particles that may serve as Dark Matter (DM)\ncandidates. These particles interact with the Standard Model via a scalar\nmediator boson $S$. More interesting still, the conjectured mass range for the\nDM candidate ($65$ - $100$ GeV) lies within the region of models viable to try\nexplain the recent Galactic Centre (GC) gamma-ray excess seen by Fermi Large\nArea Telescope (Fermi-LAT) and the High Energy Stereoscopic System (HESS).\nTherefore, assuming $S$ decays promptly, it should be possible to check what\nconstraints are imposed upon the effective DM annihilation cross-section in the\nMadala scenario by hunting signatures of $S$ decay that follows DM annihilation\nwithin dense astrophysical structures.

Within the cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm, the number of low-mass\nsubhalos within lens galaxies is expected to be large, implying that their\ncontribution to the lensing convergence field is approximately Gaussian and\ncould thus be described by their power spectrum. We develop here a general\nformalism to compute from first principles the substructure convergence power\nspectrum for different populations of dark matter subhalos. As an example, we\napply our framework to two distinct subhalo populations: a truncated\nNavarro-Frenk-White subhalo population motivated by standard CDM, and a\ntruncated cored subhalo population motivated by self-interacting dark matter\n(SIDM).

The spherical-harmonics\ncoefficients represent the sky-brightness distribution and the visibilities in\nthe $uvw$-domain, and provide a direct estimate of the spatial power spectrum.\nUsing these spectrally-smooth SpH coefficients, bright foregrounds can be\nremoved from the signal, including their side-lobe noise, which is one of the\nlimiting factors in high dynamics range wide-field imaging. Chromatic effects\ncausing the so-called \"wedge\" are effectively eliminated (i.e. deconvolved) in\nthe cylindrical ($k_{\\perp}, k_{\\parallel}$) power spectrum, compared to a\npower spectrum computed directly from the images of the foreground visibilities\nwhere the wedge is clearly present.

Thus\nfar, DDM model-building has primarily relied on non-thermal mechanisms for\nabundance generation such as misalignment production, since these mechanisms\ngive rise to abundances that have this property.

The TE correlation and\nE/B power asymmetry extend to low multipoles that were not included in earlier\nPlanck polarization papers. We also report evidence for a positive TB dust\nsignal. Combining data from Planck and WMAP, we determine the amplitudes and\nspectral energy distributions (SEDs) of polarized foregrounds, including the\ncorrelation between dust and synchrotron polarized emission, for the six sky\nregions as a function of multipole. This quantifies the challenge of the\ncomponent separation procedure required for detecting the reionization and\nrecombination peaks of primordial CMB B modes.

In this work, we investigate how a precision measurement of\nthe electron magnetic moment places meaningful constraints on both chameleons\nand symmetrons. Two effects are identified: First, virtual chameleons and\nsymmetrons run in loops to generate quantum corrections to the intrinsic value\nof the magnetic moment; a common process widely considered in the literature\nfor many scenarios beyond the Standard Model. A second effect, however, is\nunique to scalar fields that exhibit screening. A scalar bubblelike profile\nforms inside the experimental vacuum chamber and exerts a fifth force on the\nelectron, leading to a systematic shift in the experimental measurement. In\nquantifying this latter effect, we present a novel approach that combines\nanalytic arguments and a small number of numerical simulations to solve for the\nbubblelike profile quickly for a large range of model parameters. Taken\ntogether, both effects yield interesting constraints in complementary regions\nof parameter space. While the constraints we obtain for the chameleon are\nlargely uncompetitive with those in the existing literature, this still\nrepresents the tightest constraint achievable yet from an experiment not\noriginally designed to search for fifth forces. We break more ground with the\nsymmetron, for which our results exclude a large and previously unexplored\nregion of parameter space. Central to this achievement are the quantum\ncorrection terms, which are able to constrain symmetrons with masses in the\nrange $\\mu \\in [10^{-3.88},10^8]\\,\\text{eV}$, whereas other experiments have\nhitherto only been sensitive to 1 or 2 orders of magnitude at a time. \n\n"}

Screened modified gravity models can exhibit complex\nbehaviour there without violating stringent tests of gravity within our Solar\nSystem. They might hence provide viable extensions of the theory of gravity.\nHere, we use galaxy kinematics to constrain screened modified gravity models.\nWe focus on chameleon $f(R)$ gravity and predict its impact on galaxy rotation\ncurves and radial acceleration relations. This is achieved by post-processing\nstate-of-the-art galaxy formation simulations from the \\textsc{auriga project},\nusing the \\textsc{mg-gadget} code. For a given galaxy, the surface dividing\nscreened and un-screened regions adopts an oblate shape, reflecting the disc\nmorphology of the galaxy's mass distribution. At the `screening radius'---the\nradius at which screening is triggered in the disc plane---characteristic\n`upturns' are present in both rotation curves and radial acceleration\nrelations. The locations of these features depend on various factors, such as\nthe galaxy mass, the concentration of the density profile and the value of the\nbackground field amplitude $f_{R0}$. Self-screening of stars and environmental\nscreening also play a role.

At face value, the implied spectra are overly tilted to the\nred, although in both cases minor departures from pure scale freedom bring the\nspectral indices within current observational bounds.

It factorizes into an exponent given by a spherically\nsymmetric saddle-point solution and a prefactor produced by fluctuations. The\nexponent encodes the leading sensitivity of the PDF to the dynamics of\ngravitational clustering and statistics of the initial conditions. In contrast,\nthe prefactor has only a weak dependence on cosmology. It splits into a\nmonopole contribution which is evaluated exactly, and a factor corresponding to\naspherical fluctuations. The latter is crucial for the consistency of the\ncalculation: neglecting it would make the PDF incompatible with translational\ninvariance.

In particular, we use the ETHOS framework\n(Cyr-Racine et al. 2016; Vogelsberger et al. 2016) to compare statistics of the\nLyman-$\\alpha$ forest in cold dark matter (CDM) with an alternative model in\nwhich the DM couples strongly with a relativistic species in the early\nuniverse. These models are characterised by a cutoff in the linear power\nspectrum, followed by a series of 'dark acoustic oscillations' (DAOs) on\nsub-dwarf scales. While the primordial cutoff delays the formation of the first\ngalaxies, structure builds-up more rapidly in the interacting DM model compared\nto CDM. We show that although DAOs are quickly washed away in the non-linear\nclustering of DM at $z\\lesssim10$, their signature can be imprinted prominently\nin the Lyman-$\\alpha$ flux power spectrum at $z>5$.

However, at low redshift, about one-third of the baryons remain\nunaccounted for, which poses the long-standing missing baryon problem. The\nmissing baryons are believed to reside in large-scale filaments in the form of\nwarm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM). In this work, we employ a novel stacking\napproach to explore the hot phases of the WHIM. Specifically, we utilize the\n470 ks Chandra LETG data of the luminous quasar, H1821+643, along with previous\nmeasurements of UV absorption line systems and spectroscopic redshift\nmeasurements of galaxies toward the quasar's sightline. We repeatedly blueshift\nand stack the X-ray spectrum of the quasar corresponding to the redshifts of\nthe 17 absorption line systems. Thus, we obtain a stacked spectrum with $8.0$\nMs total exposure, which allows us to probe X-ray absorption lines with\nunparalleled sensitivity. Based on the stacked data, we detect an OVII\nabsorption line that exhibits a Gaussian line profile and is statistically\nsignificant at the $3.3 \\sigma$ level. Since the redshifts of the UV absorption\nline systems were known a priori, this is the first definitive detection of an\nX-ray absorption line originating from the WHIM.

No parameters with dimension of length or mass are present in the\nquantum effective action. Quantum scale symmetry is generated by quantum\nfluctuations via the presence of fixed points for running couplings. As for any\nglobal symmetry, the ground state or cosmological state may be scale invariant\nor not. Spontaneous breaking of scale symmetry leads to massive particles and\npredicts a massless Goldstone boson. A massless particle spectrum follows from\nscale symmetry of the effective action only if the ground state is scale\nsymmetric. Approximate scale symmetry close to a fixed point leads to important\npredictions for observations in various areas of fundamental physics.\n  We review consequences of scale symmetry for particle physics, quantum\ngravity and cosmology. For particle physics, scale symmetry is closely linked\nto the tiny ratio between the Fermi scale of weak interactions and the Planck\nscale for gravity. For quantum gravity, scale symmetry is associated to the\nultraviolet fixed point which allows for a non-perturbatively renormalizable\nquantum field theory for all known interactions. The interplay between gravity\nand particle physics at this fixed point permits to predict couplings of the\nstandard model or other \"effective low energy models\" for momenta below the\nPlanck mass.
