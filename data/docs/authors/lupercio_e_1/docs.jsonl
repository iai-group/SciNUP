This yields consistent\nand covariant axial anomaly coefficients on a D-1 boundary, and Chern-Simons\nterm coefficients in D.

As\nspecial cases, we obtain new (or recover well-known) formulae for the\nBaum-Fulton-MacPherson Todd (or MacPherson-Chern) classes of toric varieties,\nas well as for the Thom-Milnor L-classes of simplicial projective toric\nvarieties. We present two different perspectives for the computation of these\ncharacteristic classes of toric varieties. First, we take advantage of the\ntorus-orbit decomposition and the motivic properties of the motivic Chern and\nresp. homology Hirzebruch classes to express the latter in terms of dualizing\nsheaves and resp. the (dual) Todd classes of closures of orbits. This method\neven applies to torus-invariant subspaces of a given toric variety. The\nobtained formula is then applied to weighted lattice point counting in lattice\npolytopes and their subcomplexes, yielding generalized Pick-type formulae.\nSecondly, in the case of simplicial toric varieties, we compute our\ncharacteristic classes by using the Lefschetz-Riemann-Roch theorem of\nEdidin-Graham in the context of the geometric quotient description of such\nvarieties. In this setting, we define mock Hirzebruch classes of simplicial\ntoric varieties and investigate the difference between the (actual) homology\nHirzebruch class and the mock Hirzebruch class. We show that this difference is\nlocalized on the singular locus, and we obtain a formula for it in which the\ncontribution of each singular cone is identified explicitly.

These agree\nwith the classical Nielsen number when m = n (e.g. in the fixed point setting\nwhere M = N and one of the maps is the identity map). However, in higher\ncodimensions m - n > 0 their definitions and computations involve distinct\naspects of differential topology and homotopy theory.\n  We develop tools which help us 1.) to decide when a minimum number is equal\nto a Nielsen number (\"Wecken theorem\"), and 2.) to determine Nielsen numbers.\nHere certain homotopy theoretical criteria play a central role.

On the other hand, via large N duality, random matrix\nmodels may be holographically described by B-model closed topological strings\nin local Calabi-Yau geometries. This raises the question of constructing the\ncorresponding holographically dual resurgent transseries, tantamount to\nnonperturbative topological string theory. This paper addresses this point by\nshowing how to construct resurgent transseries solutions to the holomorphic\nanomaly equations. These solutions are built upon (generalized) multi-instanton\nsectors, where the instanton actions are holomorphic. The asymptotic expansions\naround the multi-instanton sectors have both holomorphic and anti-holomorphic\ndependence, may allow for resonance, and their structure is completely fixed by\nthe holomorphic anomaly equations in terms of specific polynomials multiplied\nby exponential factors and up to the holomorphic ambiguities -- which\ngeneralizes the known perturbative structure to the full transseries. In\nparticular, the anti-holomorphic dependence has a somewhat universal character.\nFurthermore, in the nonperturbative sectors, holomorphic ambiguities may be\nfixed at conifold points.

For this reason, it is impossible to formulate SPTs under\nGinzburg-Landau theory or probe SPTs via fractionalized bulk excitations and\ntopology-dependent ground state degeneracy. However, the partition functions\nfrom path integrals with various symmetry twists are the universal SPT\ninvariants defining topological probe responses, fully characterizing SPTs. In\nthis work, we use gauge fields to represent those symmetry twists in closed\nspacetimes of any dimensionality and arbitrary topology. This allows us to\nexpress the SPT invariants in terms of continuum field theory. We show that SPT\ninvariants of pure gauge actions describe the SPTs predicted by group\ncohomology, while the mixed gauge-gravity actions describe the\nbeyond-group-cohomology SPTs, recently observed by Kapustin.

Equipping $X$ with a\npseudometric $d$, we further refine this result and characterize the classes of\n$H_1(X)$ that may survive in the nerve complex using the notion of \\emph{size}\nof the covering elements in $\\mathcal{U}$. These fundamental results about\nnerve complexes then lead to an analysis of the $H_1$-homology of Reeb spaces,\nmappers and multiscale mappers.\n  The analysis of $H_1$-homology groups unfortunately does not extend to higher\ndimensions. Nevertheless, by using a map-induced metric, establishing a\nGromov-Hausdorff convergence result between mappers and the domain, and\ninterleaving relevant modules, we can still analyze the persistent homology\ngroups of (multiscale) mappers to establish a connection to Reeb spaces. \n\n"}

The first step reduces an input polynomial\noptimization problem into a QUBO through the computation of the Groebner basis\nof a toric ideal generated from the monomials of the input objective function.\nThe second step computes feasible embeddings. The third step computes the\nspectral gap of the adiabatic Hamiltonian associated to a given embedding.\nThese steps are applicable well beyond the integer polynomial optimization\nproblem. Our paper provides the first general purpose computational procedure\nthat can be used directly as a $translator$ to solve polynomial integer\noptimization. Alternatively, it can be used as a test-bed (with small size\nproblems) to help design efficient heuristic quantum compilers by studying\nvarious choices of reductions and embeddings in a systematic and comprehensive\nmanner. An added benefit of our framework is in designing Ising architectures\nthrough the study of $\\mathcal Y-$minor universal graphs. \n\n"}

Many of the results in this area focus on global homological\nfeatures of a subset of a Euclidean space. In this case, homology recovery\npredicates on imposing well understood geometric conditions on the underlying\nset.

For\ngenus zero one obtains the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations in this way. The\ncoefficients of the equations for genus one are found in terms of\nWeierstra\\ss-$\\sigma$ function. \n\n"}

More precisely, we show that they are related to the Hilbert scheme\nof points. We also compute the period of these spaces. As an application of our\nresult, we discuss Montonen-Olive duality in Physics. In particular our\ncomputations of Euler characteristics of moduli spaces are compatible with\nPhysical computations by Minahan et al. \n\n"}

The\nmanifolds we consider are Spin and simply connected. We prove an analogue of\nthe Gromov-Lawson Conjecture for such manifolds in the case of particular type\nof singularities. We give an affirmative answer when such manifolds with\nsingularities accept a metric of positive scalar curvature in terms of the\nindex of the Dirac operator valued in the corresponding \"K-theories with\nsingularities\". The key ideas are based on the construction due to Stolz, some\nstable homotopy theory, and the index theory for the Dirac operator applied to\nthe manifolds with singularities. As a side-product we compute homotopy types\nof the corresponding classifying spectra. \n\n"}
