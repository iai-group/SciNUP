This effect originates from the change of the\nshape of the vortex core due to non-equilibrium effects (similar to the\nmechanism of vortex motion instability in the Larkin-Ovchinnikov theory). The\nmoving vortex creates a deficit of quasiparticles in front of its motion and an\nexcess of quasiparticles behind the core of the moving vortex. This results in\nthe appearance of a wake (region with suppressed order parameter) behind the\nvortex which attracts other vortices resulting in an effective\ndirection-dependent interaction between vortices. When the vortex velocity $v$\nreaches the critical value $v_c$ quasi-phase slip lines (lines with fast vortex\nmotion) appear which may coexist with slowly moving vortices between such\nlines.

Consequently, by supplementing the Hamiltonian of\nthe SU(N) model with a perturbation Hamiltonian that removes the GS degeneracy,\nthe LT is to apply also for the SU(N) model in the limit of the coupling\nconstant, \\lambda, of this perturbation approaching zero, where the limit\n\\lambda --> 0 is clearly to be taken subsequent to taking the zero-temperature\nlimit of the thermal single-particle Green function in the expression for the\nLuttinger number N_L. We explicitly establish the validity of this statement\nfor the case of N=4. The details of the relevant calculations being distinctly\ntransparent, one can readily convince oneself that our observation is valid for\narbitrary N. It follows that the issues raised by DPK, such as non-existence of\nthe Luttinger-Ward functional and \"breakdown of the elemental particle picture\nin strongly correlated electron matter\", are all inessential to the observed\nfailure of the LT. As regards the singularity of the self-energy \\Sigma(\\omega)\non the real \\omega-axis, observed by DPK, we demonstrate that this also is a\ndirect consequence of the non-uniqueness of the GS of the SU(N) model for 0 < n\n< N.

One established example with topological order is the\nvalence bond solid (VBS) states in quantum antiferromagnets. The VBS states are\ndisordered spin liquids with no spontaneous symmetry breaking but most\ntypically manifest topological order known as hidden string order on 1D chain.\nInterestingly, the VBS models are based on mathematics analogous to fuzzy\ngeometry. We review applications of the mathematics of fuzzy super-geometry in\nthe construction of supersymmetric versions of VBS (SVBS) states, and give a\npedagogical introduction of SVBS models and their properties [arXiv:0809.4885,\n1105.3529, 1210.0299]. As concrete examples, we present detail analysis of\nsupersymmetric versions of SU(2) and SO(5) VBS states, i.e. UOSp(N|2) and\nUOSp(N|4) SVBS states whose mathematics are closely related to fuzzy two- and\nfour-superspheres. The SVBS states are physically interpreted as hole-doped VBS\nstates with superconducting property that interpolate various VBS states\ndepending on value of a hole-doping parameter. The parent Hamiltonians for SVBS\nstates are explicitly constructed, and their gapped excitations are derived\nwithin the single-mode approximation on 1D SVBS chains.

We detect no signatures of spatial modulations along the nodal\ndirection in Bi2201, thus clarifying the inter-unit-cell momentum-structure of\ncharge order. We also resolve the intra-unit-cell symmetry of the charge\nordered state, which is revealed to be best represented by a bond-order with\nmodulated charges on the O-2p orbitals and a prominent d-wave character. These\nresults provide insights on the microscopic description of charge order in\ncuprates, and on its origin and interplay with superconductivity. \n\n"}

The number of the components of these coarse-grained\nfermions is reduced compared to the original system. Here we consider the $3+1$\nD system and concentrate on the particular case when the Fermi surface has\nco-dimension $p=3$, i.e. it represents the Fermi point in momentum space. First\nwe demonstrate explicitly that in agreement with Ho\\v{r}ava conjecture, in the\nvicinity of the Fermi point the original system is reduced to the model with\ntwo - component Weyl spinors. Next, we generalize the construction of\nHo\\v{r}ava to the situation, when the original $3+1$ D theory contains multi -\ncomponent Majorana spinors. In this case the system is also reduced to the\nmodel of the two - component Weyl fermions in the vicinity of the topologically\nstable Fermi point.

In earlier work\n(arXiv:1211.1776) the scalar field had a strong self-coupling, in which case\nthe backreaction on both the metric and the gauge field can be ignored.

Long-range and static CuO6 tilt order with\northogonally inequivalent Cu-O bonds in the CuO2 planes in the low temperature\ntetragonal (LTT) phase is succeeded on warming through the low-temperature\ntransition by one with orthogonally equivalent bonds in the low temperature\northorhombic (LTO) phase.

Recent experimental\ndevelopments have made possible to monitor the time-evolution of both the\nsingle-particle and collective excitations under extreme conditions, such as\nthose arising from strong and selective photo-stimulation.\n  Here, we review the most recent achievements in the experimental and\ntheoretical studies of the non-equilibrium electronic, optical, structural and\nmagnetic properties of correlated materials. The focus will be mainly on the\nprototypical case of correlated oxides that exhibit unconventional\nsuperconductivity or other exotic phases, even though the discussion will\nextend also to other topical systems. The necessity of extending the actual\nexperimental capabilities and the numerical and analytic tools to\nmicroscopically treat the non-equilibrium phenomena beyond the simple\nphenomenological approaches represents one of the most challenging new frontier\nin physics. \n\n"}

However, one\nrecent experiment about herbertsmithite with successful Li-doping shows\nsurprisingly the insulating state even under the heavy doped scenario, which\ncan hardly be explained by many-body physics. Using first-principles\ncalculation, we performed a comprehensive study about the Li intercalated\ndoping effect of these two compounds. For the Li-doped herbertsmithite, we\nidentified the optimized Li position at the Cl-(OH)$_3$-Cl pentahedron site\ninstead of previously speculated Cl-(OH)$_3$ tetrahedral site. With the\nincrease of Li doping concentration, the saturation magnetization decreases\nlinearly due to the charge transfer from Li to Cu ions. Moreover, we found that\nLi forms chemical bonds with the nearby (OH)$^-$ and Cl$^-$ ions, which lowers\nthe surrounding chemical potential and traps the electron, as evidenced by the\nlocalized charge distribution, explaining the insulating behavior measured\nexperimentally. Though with different structure from herbertsmithite, Zn-doped\nBarlowite shows the same features upon Li doping.

Depending on the concentration, the\npresence of these defects in LaAlO3 slab can suppress the surface conductivity.\nIn contrast, in insulating SrTiO3 slabs already very small concentrations of\noxygen vacancies or hydrogen dopant atoms induce a finite occupation of the\nconduction band. Surface defects in insulating LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterostructure\nslabs with three LaAlO3 overlayers lead to the emergence of interface\nconductivity. Calculated defect formation energies reveal strong preference of\nhydrogen dopant atoms for surface sites for all structures and concentrations\nconsidered.

Strictly in two dimensions, the microscopic\nHubbard model has an (resonating valence bond) insulator-to-metal transition at\n$x=x_{c}$ near optimal doping for zero temperature, leading to a quantum\ncritical point, and one of the crossover lines is given by the pseudogap\ntemperature $T^{*}$.

We prove the existence of an upper bound on\nthe partition function for holons in a spinon background, and we find the\noptimal spinon configuration saturating the upper bound on average--a\ncoexisting flux phase and s+id-like RVB state. After neglecting the feedback of\nholon fluctuations on the U(1) field B and spinon fluctuations on the SU(2)\nfield V, the holon field is a fermion and the spinon field is a hard--core\nboson. We show that the B field produces a \\pi flux phase for holons,\nconverting them into Dirac--like fermions, while the V field, taking into\naccount the feedback of holons produces a gap for spinons vanishing in zero\ndoping limit.
