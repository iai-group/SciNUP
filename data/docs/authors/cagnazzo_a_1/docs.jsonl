Making a quantum expansion around such\na time dependent solution is found to break fundamental symmetries of quantum\nfield theory. We call this mechanism cosmological symmetry breaking and argue\nthat it is different from the standard phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking. We illustrate this with a toy scalar field theory, whose action\ndisplays a U(1) symmetry. We identify a symmetry, called pseudo-scale\ninvariance, which sets the cosmological constant exactly equal to zero, both in\nclassical and quantum theory. This symmetry is also broken cosmologically and\nleads to a nonzero vacuum or dark energy. The slow roll condition along with\nthe observed value of dark energy leads to a value of the background scalar\nfield of the order of Planck mass. We also consider a U(1) gauge symmetry\nmodel. Cosmological symmetry breaking, in this case, leads to a non zero mass\nfor the vector field.

The\nmotivation for this (seemingly academic) endeavour is to take the background\nindependence intrinsic to Einstein gravity one step further, and to assure that\nboth the equations of motion and the way in which those equations of motion are\nderived are as self-consistent as possible.

A suitably\ncovariant infinite-component localization is displayed, reflecting Bergmann's\nrealization that there are infinitely many conserved gravitational\nenergy-momenta. Initially use is made of a flat background metric (or rather,\nall of them) or connection, because the desired gauge invariance properties are\nobvious. Partial gauge-fixing then yields an appropriate covariant quantity\nwithout any background metric or connection; one version is the collection of\npseudotensors of a given type, such as the Einstein pseudotensor, in_every_\ncoordinate system. This solution to the gauge covariance problem is easily\nadapted to any pseudotensorial expression (Landau-Lifshitz, Goldberg,\nPapapetrou or the like) or to any tensorial expression built with a background\nmetric or connection. Thus the specific functional form can be chosen on\ntechnical grounds such as relating to Noether's theorem and yielding expected\nvalues of conserved quantities in certain contexts and then rendered covariant\nusing the procedure described here.

In\nparticular the gravity dual has squashed two spheres, and a small resolution at\nthe IR. Using this background we show that the drag of a massive quark receives\ncorrections that are proportional to powers of log T when compared with the\ndrag computed using AdS/QCD correspondence. We use the perturbation produced by\nthe quark strings to compute the wake and compare with the results obtained\nusing AdS/QCD correspondence.

For this, it is first necessary to review previous methods to\napply QCD perturbation theory at low spacelike momentum scales, where the\ninfluence of the Landau singularities becomes inevitable. Several concepts are\nconsidered and their limitations are pointed out. The usefulness of FAPT is\ndiscussed in terms of two characteristic hadronic quantities: the\nperturbatively calculable part of the pion's electromagnetic form factor in the\nspacelike region and the Higgs-boson decay into a $b\\bar b$ pair in the\ntimelike region. In the first case, the focus is on the optimization of the\nprediction with respect to the choice of the renormalization scheme and the\ndependence on the renormalization and the factorization scales. The second case\nserves to show that the application of FAPT to this reaction reaches already at\nthe four-loop level an accuracy of the order of 1%, avoiding difficulties\ninherent in the standard perturbative expansion. The obtained results are\ncompared with estimates from fixed-order and contour-improved QCD perturbation\ntheory.

We present a new mechanism for\ngeneration of large-scale magnetic field, based on the power-counting\nrenormalizable theory of gravitation recently proposed by Horava. Contrary to\nthe usual case in general relativity, the U(1) gauge symmetry of a Maxwell\naction in this theory permits terms breaking conformal invariance in the\nultraviolet.

Abstract: Naked singularities are hypothetical astrophysical objects, characterized by\na gravitational singularity without an event horizon. Penrose has proposed a\nconjecture, according to which there exists a cosmic censor who forbids the\noccurrence of naked singularities. Distinguishing between astrophysical black\nholes and naked singularities is a major challenge for present day\nobservational astronomy. A possibility of differentiating naked singularities\nfrom black holes is through the comparative study of thin accretion disks\nproperties around rotating naked singularities and Kerr-type black holes,\nrespectively. In the present paper, we consider accretion disks around rotating\nnaked singularities, obtained as solutions of the field equations in the\nEinstein-massless scalar field theory. A first major difference between\nrotating naked singularities and Kerr black holes is in the frame dragging\neffect, the angular velocity of a rotating naked singularity being inversely\nproportional to its spin parameter. Due to the differences in the exterior\ngeometry, the thermodynamic and electromagnetic properties of the disks are\ndifferent for these two classes of compact objects, consequently giving clear\nobservational signatures that could discriminate between black holes and naked\nsingularities. For specific values of the spin parameter and of the scalar\ncharge, the energy flux from the disk around a rotating naked singularity can\nexceed by several orders of magnitude the flux from the disk of a Kerr black\nhole. The conversion efficiency of the accreting mass into radiation by\nrotating naked singularities is always higher than the conversion efficiency\nfor black holes. Thus, these observational signatures may provide the necessary\ntools from clearly distinguishing rotating naked singularities from Kerr-type\nblack holes. \n\n"}

Under some minimal assumptions, we argue\nthat the first condition is satisfied only when neighboring trajectories\nthrough the two-dimensional field space diverge during inflation.\nGeometrically, this means that the inflaton must roll along a ridge in the\npotential V for some time during inflation and that its trajectory must turn\nslightly (but not too sharply) in field space.

One of\nthe main themes in this work is that, after a careful study of the mathematics\nof the symmetry algebras one finds that in an integrable model, one can\ndirectly reconstruct S-matrices just from the algebra. It has been known for a\nlong time that S-matrices in integrable models are fixed by symmetry. However,\nLie algebra symmetry, the Yang-Baxter equation, crossing and unitarity, which\nare what constrains the S-matrix in integrable models, are often taken to be\nseparate, independent properties of the S-matrix. Here, we construct scattering\nmatrices purely from the Yangian, showing that the Yangian is the right\nalgebraic object to unify all required symmetries of many integrable models. In\nparticular, we reconstruct the S-matrix of the principal chiral field, and, up\nto a CDD factor, of other integrable field theories with su(n) symmetry.\nFurthermore, we study the AdS/CFT correspondence, which is also believed to be\nintegrable in the planar limit.

The asymptotic symmetries are spanned\nby an extension of the super-BMS$_3$ algebra, with two independent $\\hat{u}(1)$\ncurrents of electric and magnetic type.

The entropy of flat cosmological\nspacetimes with $U(1)$ fields then acquires a nontrivial dependence on the\n$\\hat{u}(1)$ charges. If the spin structure is odd, the ground state\ncorresponds to Minkowski spacetime, and although the anticommutator of the\ncanonical supercharges is linear in the energy and in the electric-like\n$\\hat{u}(1)$ charge, the energy becomes bounded from below by the energy of the\nground state shifted by the square of the electric-like $\\hat{u}(1)$ charge.

To do so, we\nfirst define the conditions for bulk reconstructability. Under these terms, we\nscrutinize two cases of maximally entangled holographic states. One is the\nfamiliar example of AdS black holes; these are dual to thermal states of the\nboundary CFT. Sending the temperature to the cutoff scale makes the state\nmaximally entangled and the respective black hole consumes the spacetime. We\nthen examine the de Sitter limit of FRW spacetimes. This limit is maximally\nentangled if one formulates the boundary theory on the holographic screen.\nParalleling the AdS black hole, we find the resulting reconstructable region of\nspacetime vanishes.

The purpose\nof this work is to expound the impact on the creation of entanglement coming\nfrom the combined action of the different physical processes underlying the\nHawking effect and the Unruh-Starobinskii effect. We demonstrate that, in the\nscenario of rotating black holes, the degree of quantum entanglement is\nsignificantly modified due to the phenomenon of superradiance in comparison\nwith the analogous cases in a Schwarzschild spacetime.

With this simplification, our numerical\nmethod may be applied to unconventional chaotic inflation models. To\ndemonstrate its validity, we numerically analyze the preheating stage of\naxion-monodromy inflation which is inspired by string theory. By performing\nperturbation analyses, our result shows that the power spectrum of primordial\ncurvature perturbation can be dominated by fluctuations of entropy field rather\nthan those of inflaton, which can be regarded as a particular realization of\nthe curvaton mechanism through a preheating process. \n\n"}

We begin by showing how\nthe application of Raychaudhuri equation to inhomogeneous cosmologies results\nin several ``no go'' theorems for accelerated expansion. Next we derive an\nexact solution for a specific case of initial perturbations, for which\napplication of the Kolb et al. expressions leads to an acceleration, while the\nexact solution reveals that no acceleration is present. We show that the\ndiscrepancy can be traced to higher order terms that were dropped in the Kolb\net al. analysis.

Just like their non-supersymmetric counterparts, SLED models\npredict gravity to deviate from the inverse-square law because of the advent of\nnew dimensions at sub-millimeter scales. However SLED models differ from their\nnon-supersymmetric counterparts in three important ways: (i) the size of the\nextra dimensions is fixed by the observed value of the Dark Energy density,\nmaking it impossible to shorten the range over which new deviations from\nNewton's law must be seen; (ii) supersymmetry predicts there to be more fields\nin the extra dimensions than just gravity, implying different types of\ncouplings to matter and the possibility of repulsive as well as attractive\ninteractions; and (iii) the same mechanism which is purported to keep the\ncosmological constant naturally small also keeps the extra-dimensional moduli\neffectively massless, leading to deviations from General Relativity in the far\ninfrared of the scalar-tensor form.

I decided to put it to hep-th,\nto make it easily available. Many things happened during the 15 years since the\ntime when it was written. In particular, we have learned a lot about the high\ntemperature behavior in the electroweak theory and about baryogenesis. A\ndiscovery of the acceleration of the universe has changed the way we are\nthinking about the problem of the vacuum energy: Instead of trying to explain\nwhy it is zero, we are trying to understand why it is anomalously small. Recent\ncosmological observations have shown that the universe is flat, or almost\nexactly flat, and confirmed many other predictions of inflationary theory. Many\nnew versions of this theory have been developed, including hybrid inflation and\ninflationary models based on string theory. There was a substantial progress in\nthe theory of reheating of the universe after inflation, and in the theory of\neternal inflation. It's clear, therefore, that some parts of the book should be\nupdated, which I might do sometimes in the future. I hope, however, that this\nbook may be of some interest even in its original form. I am using it in my\nlectures on inflationary cosmology at Stanford, supplementing it with the\ndiscussion of the subjects mentioned above. I would suggest to read this book\nin parallel with the book by Liddle and Lyth \"Cosmological Inflation and Large\nScale Structure,'' with the book by Mukhanov \"Physical Foundations of\nCosmology,'' to be published soon, and with my review article hep-th/0503195,\nwhich contains a discussion of some (but certainly not all) of the recent\ndevelopments in inflationary theory. \n\n"}

We\nfind that the most general supersymmetric solution is parametrized by six real\nmoduli and analyze its properties using the theory of algebraic curves. In the\ngeneric case, where no continuous subgroup of the original SO(6) symmetry\nremains unbroken, the algebraic curve of the corresponding solution is a\nRiemann surface of genus seven. When some cycles shrink to zero size the\nsymmetry group is enhanced, whereas the genus of the Riemann surface is lowered\naccordingly. The uniformization of the curves is carried out explicitly and\nyields various supersymmetric configurations in terms of elliptic functions. We\nalso analyze the ten-dimensional type-IIB supergravity origin of our solutions\nand show that they represent the gravitational field of a large number of\nD3-branes continuously distributed on hyper-surfaces embedded in the\nsix-dimensional space transverse to the branes.
