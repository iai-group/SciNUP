Using\nthese approximations for larger subsets of neurons, we find that extracting\ncouplings using data from a subset smaller than the full network tends\nsystematically to overestimate their magnitude. This effect is described\nqualitatively by infinite-range spin glass theory for the normal phase. We also\nshow that a globally-correlated input to the neurons in the network lead to a\nsmall increase in the average coupling. However, the pair-to-pair variation of\nthe couplings is much larger than this and reflects intrinsic properties of the\nnetwork. Finally, we study the quality of these models by comparing their\nentropies with that of the data. We find that they perform well for small\nsubsets of the neurons in the network, but the fit quality starts to\ndeteriorate as the subset size grows, signalling the need to include higher\norder correlations to describe the statistics of large networks. \n\n"}

Furthermore,\nwe shall deal with this problem in the realm of cosmological spacetimes by\nanalyzing the Einstein equations in a semiclassical fashion. More precisely, we\nshall show that, at least on small intervals of time, solutions for this\ninteracting system exist. This result will be achieved providing an iteration\nscheme and showing that the series, obtained starting from the massless\nsolution, converges in the appropriate Banach space. The quantum states with\ngood ultraviolet behavior (Hadamard property), used in order to obtain the\nbackreaction, will be completely determined by their form on the initial\nsurface if chosen to be lightlike. Furthermore, on small intervals of time,\nthey do not influence the behavior of the exact solution.

Recent empirical studies,\nhowever, suggest a vast simplification in how multi-neuron spiking occurs: the\nactivity patterns of some circuits are nearly completely captured by pairwise\ninteractions among neurons. Why are such pairwise models so successful in some\ninstances, but insufficient in others? Here, we study the emergence of\nhigher-order interactions in simple circuits with different architectures and\ninputs. We quantify the impact of higher-order interactions by comparing the\nresponses of mechanistic circuit models vs. \"null\" descriptions in which all\nhigher-than-pairwise correlations have been accounted for by lower order\nstatistics, known as pairwise maximum entropy models.\n  We find that bimodal input signals produce larger deviations from pairwise\npredictions than unimodal inputs for circuits with local and global\nconnectivity. Moreover, recurrent coupling can accentuate these deviations, if\ncoupling strengths are neither too weak nor too strong. A circuit model based\non intracellular recordings from ON parasol retinal ganglion cells shows that a\nbroad range of light signals induce unimodal inputs to spike generators, and\nthat coupling strengths produce weak effects on higher-order interactions.

These\nequations are implicit on the probability distribution of the solutions which\ngenerally makes their direct analysis difficult. However, in our case, the\nsolutions are Gaussian, and their moments satisfy a closed system of nonlinear\nordinary differential equations (ODEs), which are much easier to study than the\noriginal stochastic network equations, and the statistics of the empirical\nprocess uniformly converge towards the solutions of these ODEs.

In particular there is the\nresult on color breaking by non-abelian magnetic monopoles. This anomaly can be\nrectified by using impure states. We also argue that non-abelian groups of\ntwisted bundles are always anomalous for pure states sharpening an earlier\nargument of Sorkin and Balachandran. This is the case of mapping class groups\nof geons indicating that \"large\" diffeos are anomalous for pure states in the\npresence of geons. Nevertheless diffeo invariance may be restored by using\nimpure states. This work concludes with examples of these ideas drawn from\nmolecular physics.\n  The above approach using impure states is entirely equivalent to restricting\nall states to the algebra of observables invariant under the anomalous\nsymmetries. For anomalous gauge groups such as color, this would mean that we\nwork with observables singlet under global gauge transformations. For color,\nthis will mean that we work with color singlets, a reasonable constraint. \n\n"}

As an example, the\nsemi-relativistic oscillator as a descriptive of the Landau levels for\nrelativistic electron in magnetic field is solved as an $f$-oscillator.

The same dispersion allows us to construct integrable q-NLS model as\na deformation of cubic NLS in terms of recursion operator of NLS hierarchy.\nPeculiar property of the model is to be completely integrable at any order of\nexpansion in deformation parameter around $q=1$. As another variation on the\ntheme, we consider hydrodynamic flow in bounded domain.

A first step towards that larger goal is to\ndevelop information measures for individual output processes, including\ninformation generation (entropy rate), stored information (statistical\ncomplexity), predictable information (excess entropy), and active information\naccumulation (bound information rate). We calculate these for spike trains\ngenerated by a variety of noise-driven integrate-and-fire neurons as a function\nof time resolution and for alternating renewal processes. We show that their\ntime-resolution dependence reveals coarse-grained structural properties of\ninterspike interval statistics; e.g., $\\tau$-entropy rates that diverge less\nquickly than the firing rate indicate interspike interval correlations. We also\nfind evidence that the excess entropy and regularized statistical complexity of\ndifferent types of integrate-and-fire neurons are universal in the\ncontinuous-time limit in the sense that they do not depend on mechanism\ndetails. This suggests a surprising simplicity in the spike trains generated by\nthese model neurons. Interestingly, neurons with gamma-distributed ISIs and\nneurons whose spike trains are alternating renewal processes do not fall into\nthe same universality class.

This construction reveals an algebraic structure of the\nHagedorn wave packets, and explains the relative simplicity of Hagedorn's\nparametrization compared to the rather intricate construction of the\ngeneralized squeezed states. We apply our formulation to show the existence of\nminimal uncertainty products for the Hagedorn wave packets, generalizing\nHagedorn's one-dimensional result to multi-dimensions. The Hagedorn--Hermite\ncorrespondence also leads to an alternative derivation of the generating\nfunction for the Hagedorn wave packets based on the generating function for the\nHermite functions. This result, in turn, reveals the relationship between the\nHagedorn polynomials and the Hermite polynomials. \n\n"}

For stochastic systems, one typically\nassumes that these trajectories are generated under the \"same noise\nrealization\". The purpose of this work is to critically examine what this\nexpression means. For Brownian particles, we consider two natural\ninterpretations of the noise: intrinsic to the particles or stemming from the\nfluctuations of the environment. We show how they lead to different\ndistributions of the largest Lyapunov exponent as well as different fluctuating\nhydrodynamics for the collective density field.

How is this accomplished?\nVarious approaches to this basic question have been considered.

We approach this question for\nnetworks with linear time-invariant dynamics by relating internal network\nfeedbacks to the statistical prevalence of connectivity motifs, a set of\nsurprisingly simple and local statistics of connectivity. This results in a\nreduced order model of the network input-output dynamics in terms of motifs\nstructures. As an example, the new formulation dramatically simplifies the\nclassic Erdos-Renyi graph, reducing the overall network behavior to one\nproportional feedback wrapped around the dynamics of a single node. For general\nnetworks, higher-order motifs systematically provide further layers and types\nof feedback to regulate the network response. Thus, the local connectivity\nshapes temporal and spectral processing by the network as a whole, and we show\nhow this enables robust, yet tunable, functionality such as extending the time\nconstant with which networks remember past signals.

In particular, any 4-point $\\phi^4$ graph can be uniquely\nderived from a 4-regular graph by deleting a vertex. The Feynman period is a\nsimplified version of the Feynman integral, and is of special interest, as it\nmaintains much of the important number theoretic information from the Feynman\nintegral. It is also of structural interest, as it is known to be preserved by\na number of graph theoretic operations. In particular, the vertex deleted in\nconstructing the 4-point graph does not affect the Feynman period, and it is\ninvariant under planar duality and the Schnetz twist, an operation that\nredirects edges incident to a 4-vertex cut. Further, a 4-regular graph may be\nproduced by a 3-sum operation on triangles in two 4-regular graphs. The Feynman\nperiod of this graph with a vertex deleted is equal to the product of the\nFeynman periods of the two smaller graphs with one vertex deleted each. These\noperations currently explain all known instances of non-isomorphic 4-point\n$\\phi^4$ graphs with equal periods.\n  With this in mind, other graph invariants that are preserved by these\noperations for 4-point $\\phi^4$ graphs are of interest, as they may provide\ninsight into the Feynman period. In this thesis the extended graph permanent is\nintroduced; an infinite sequence of residues from prime order finite fields. It\nis shown that this sequence is preserved by these three operations, and has a\nproduct property. Additionally, computational techniques will be established,\nand an alternate interpretation will be presented as the point count of a novel\ngraph polynomial.\n  Further, the previously existing $c_2$ invariant and Hepp bound are examined,\ntwo graph invariants that are conjectured to be preserved by these graph\noperations.

In principle,\ntherefore, the hypothesis cannot be correct, although it may be a good\napproximation. It follows, at least in principle, that the quantitative aspects\nof the hypothesis of local stationarity could be tested by a comparison of the\nasymptotic dimensionless dissipation rate for free decay with that for the\nstationary case. But in practice this is complicated by the absence of an\nagreed evolution time for making the measurements during the decay.

We propose that the defining difference between in vitro\nand in vivo dynamics is the strength of external input. In vitro, networks are\nvirtually isolated, whereas in vivo every brain area receives continuous input.\nWe analyze a model of spiking neurons in which the input strength, mediated by\nspike rate homeostasis, determines the characteristics of the dynamical state.\nIn more detail, our analytical and numerical results on various network\ntopologies show consistently that under increasing input, homeostatic\nplasticity generates distinct dynamic states, from bursting, to\nclose-to-critical, reverberating and irregular states. This implies that the\ndynamic state of a neural network is not fixed but can readily adapt to the\ninput strengths.

Since the\nprecise statistical properties of neural activity are important in this\ncontext, many models assume an ad-hoc source of well-behaved, explicit noise,\neither on the input or on the output side of single neuron dynamics, most often\nassuming an independent Poisson process in either case. However, these\nassumptions are somewhat problematic: neighboring neurons tend to share\nreceptive fields, rendering both their input and their output correlated; at\nthe same time, neurons are known to behave largely deterministically, as a\nfunction of their membrane potential and conductance. We suggest that spiking\nneural networks may, in fact, have no need for noise to perform sampling-based\nBayesian inference.

We show that the\nminimally bosonized SUSYQM can be obtained from Witten's SUSYQM by applying to\nit a nonlocal unitary transformation with a subsequent reduction to one of the\neigenspaces of the total reflection operator. The transformation depends on the\nparity operator, and the deformed Heisenberg algebra with reflection,\nintimately related to parabosons and parafermions, emerges here in a natural\nway. It is shown that the minimally bosonized SUSYQM can also be understood as\nsupersymmetric two-fermion system. With this interpretation, the bosonization\nconstruction is generalized to the case of N=1 supersymmetry in 2 dimensions.\nThe same special unitary transformation diagonalises the Hamiltonian operator\nof the 2D massive free Dirac theory.

We start with derivation of an exact RG equation which is analogous\nto the Wilsonian RG equations in statistical physics and quantum field theory.\nIt is clarified that the perturbative RG method constructs invariant manifolds\nsuccessively as the initial value of evolution equations, thereby the meaning\nto set $t_0=t$ is naturally understood where $t_0$ is the arbitrary initial\ntime. We show that the integral constants in the unperturbative solution\nconstitutes natural coordinates of the invariant manifold when the linear\noperator $A$ in the evolution equation has no Jordan cell; when $A$ has a\nJordan cell, a slight modification is necessary because the dimension of the\ninvariant manifold is increased by the perturbation. The RG equation determines\nthe slow motion of the would-be integral constants in the unperturbative\nsolution on the invariant manifold.

{"id": "quant-ph/0606186", "contents": "Title: On the inconsistency of the Bohm-Gadella theory with quantum mechanics Abstract: The Bohm-Gadella theory, sometimes referred to as the Time Asymmetric Quantum\nTheory of Scattering and Decay, is based on the Hardy axiom. The Hardy axiom\nasserts that the solutions of the Lippmann-Schwinger equation are functionals\nover spaces of Hardy functions. The preparation-registration arrow of time\nprovides the physical justification for the Hardy axiom. In this paper, it is\nshown that the Hardy axiom is incorrect, because the solutions of the\nLippmann-Schwinger equation do not act on spaces of Hardy functions. It is also\nshown that the derivation of the preparation-registration arrow of time is\nflawed. Thus, Hardy functions neither appear when we solve the\nLippmann-Schwinger equation nor they should appear. It is also shown that the\nBohm-Gadella theory does not rest on the same physical principles as quantum\nmechanics, and that it does not solve any problem that quantum mechanics cannot\nsolve. The Bohm-Gadella theory must therefore be abandoned. \n\n"}

{"id": "quant-ph/0703060", "contents": "Title: A Topos Foundation for Theories of Physics: I. Formal Languages for\n  Physics Abstract: This paper is the first in a series whose goal is to develop a fundamentally\nnew way of constructing theories of physics. The motivation comes from a desire\nto address certain deep issues that arise when contemplating quantum theories\nof space and time. Our basic contention is that constructing a theory of\nphysics is equivalent to finding a representation in a topos of a certain\nformal language that is attached to the system. Classical physics arises when\nthe topos is the category of sets. Other types of theory employ a different\ntopos. In this paper we discuss two different types of language that can be\nattached to a system, S. The first is a propositional language, PL(S); the\nsecond is a higher-order, typed language L(S). Both languages provide deductive\nsystems with an intuitionistic logic. The reason for introducing PL(S) is that,\nas shown in paper II of the series, it is the easiest way of understanding, and\nexpanding on, the earlier work on topos theory and quantum physics. However,\nthe main thrust of our programme utilises the more powerful language L(S) and\nits representation in an appropriate topos. \n\n"}
