The evolution is governed by the interplay between smooth and clumpy\ncold streams, disk instability, and bulge formation. Intense, relatively smooth\nstreams maintain an unstable dense gas-rich disk. Instability with high\nturbulence and giant clumps, each a few percent of the disk mass, is\nself-regulated by gravitational interactions within the disk. The clumps\nmigrate into a bulge in ~10 dynamical times, or ~0.5Gyr. The cosmological\nstreams replenish the draining disk and prolong the clumpy phase to several\nGigayears in a steady state, with comparable masses in disk, bulge, and dark\nmatter within the disk radius. The clumps form stars in dense subclumps\nfollowing the overall accretion rate, ~100 Msun/yr, and each clump converts\ninto stars in ~0.5 Gyr. While the clumps coalesce dissipatively to a compact\nbulge, the star-forming disk is extended because the incoming streams keep the\nouter disk dense and susceptible to instability and because of angular momentum\ntransport. Passive spheroid-dominated galaxies form when the streams are more\nclumpy: the external clumps merge into a massive bulge and stir up disk\nturbulence that stabilize the disk and suppress in situ clump and star\nformation.

Using realistic parameters for the\nGalactic potential, gaseous halo, Galactic disk, velocities of dwarf galaxies,\nand effects of drag on stripped gas in the halo, we model the distribution of\nradii at which dwarf galaxies accrete onto the Galactic disk. We also model the\nradial distribution of the accretion of gas that cools directly out of the halo\nby examining the results of recent simulations.

A relativistic jet is capable of accelerating lower-energy heavy\nseed cosmic rays (CRs) to UHECRs on timescales comparable to the time it takes\nthe jet to pierce the large gaseous cloud. In this model many CRs arising from\na starburst, with a composition enhanced in heavy elements near the knee region\naround PeV, are boosted to ultra-high energies by the relativistic shock of a\nnewly oriented jet.

Our model shows that recycled gas\nfrom stellar mass loss can provide most or all of the fuel required to sustain\nthe current level of star formation in late type galaxies. Stellar mass loss\ncan therefore remove the tension between the low gas infall rates that are\nderived from observations and the relatively rapid star formation occurring in\ndisk galaxies. For galaxies where cold gas infall rates have been estimated, we\ndemonstrate explicitly that stellar mass loss can account for most of the\ndeficit between their star formation and infall rates. \n\n"}

Abstract: Weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) are amongst the most interesting\ndark matter (DM) candidates. Many DM candidates naturally arise in theories\nbeyond the standard model (SM) of particle physics, like weak-scale\nsupersymmetry (SUSY). Experiments aim to detect WIMPs by scattering,\nannihilation or direct production, and thereby determine the underlying theory\nto which they belong, along with its parameters. Here we examine the prospects\nfor further constraining the Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model\n(CMSSM) with future ton-scale direct detection experiments. We consider\nton-scale extrapolations of three current experiments: CDMS, XENON and COUPP,\nwith 1000 kg-years of raw exposure each. We assume energy resolutions, energy\nranges and efficiencies similar to the current versions of the experiments, and\ninclude backgrounds at target levels.

Slowed down in the\nterrestrial matter, OHe is elusive for direct methods of underground Dark\nmatter detection using its nuclear recoil. However, low energy binding of OHe\nwith sodium nuclei can lead to annual variations of energy release from OHe\nradiative capture in the interval of energy 2-4 keV in DAMA/NaI and DAMA/LIBRA\nexperiments. At nuclear parameters, reproducing DAMA results, the energy\nrelease predicted for detectors with chemical content other than NaI differ in\nthe most cases from the one in DAMA detector. Moreover there is no bound\nsystems of OHe with light and heavy nuclei, so that there is no radiative\ncapture of OHe in detectors with xenon or helium content. Due to dipole Coulomb\nbarrier, transitions to more energetic levels of Na+OHe system with much higher\nenergy release are suppressed in the correspondence with the results of DAMA\nexperiments.

Intergalactic Globular Clusters and\n  the Massive Globular Cluster System at the Core of the Coma Galaxy Cluster Abstract: Intracluster stellar populations are a natural result of tidal interactions\nin galaxy clusters. Measuring these populations is difficult, but important for\nunderstanding the assembly of the most massive galaxies. The Coma cluster is\none of the nearest truly massive galaxy clusters, and is host to a\ncorrespondingly large system of globular clusters (GCs). We use imaging from\nthe HST/ACS Coma Cluster Survey to present the first definitive detection of a\nlarge population of intracluster GCs (IGCs) that fills the Coma cluster core\nand is not associated with individual galaxies. The GC surface density profile\naround the central massive elliptical galaxy, NGC 4874, is dominated at large\nradii by a population of IGCs that extend to the limit of our data (R<520 kpc).\nWe estimate that there are 47000+/-1600 (random) +4000/-5000 (systematic) IGCs\nout to this radius, and that they make up ~70% of the central GC system, making\nthis the largest GC system in the nearby Universe. Even including the GC\nsystems of other cluster galaxies, IGCs still make up ~30-45% of the GCs in the\ncluster core. Observational limits from previous studies of the intracluster\nlight (ICL) suggest that the IGC population has a high specific frequency. If\nthe IGC population has a specific frequency similar to high-S_N dwarf galaxies,\nthen the ICL has a total stellar mass of ~10^12 M_sun within the cluster core.\nThe ICL makes up approximately half of the stellar luminosity and one-third of\nthe stellar mass of the central (NGC4874+ICL) system. The color distribution of\nthe IGC population is bimodal, with blue, metal-poor GCs outnumbering red,\nmetal-rich GCs by a ratio of 4:1. The fraction of red IGCs (20%), and the red\ncolor of those GCs, implies that IGCs can originate from the halos of\nrelatively massive, L* galaxies, and not solely from the disruption of dwarf\ngalaxies.

These oscillations induce time varying CP-odd nuclear moments,\nsuch as electric dipole and Schiff moments. The coupling between internal\natomic fields and these nuclear moments gives rise to time varying shifts to\natomic energy levels. These effects can be enhanced by using elements with\nlarge Schiff moments such as the light Actinides, and states with large\nspontaneous parity violation, such as molecules in a background electric field.\nThe energy level shift in such a molecule can be ~ 10^-24 eV or larger. While\nchallenging, this energy shift may be observable in a molecular clock\nconfiguration with technology presently under development. The detectability of\nthis energy shift is enhanced by the fact that it is a time varying shift whose\noscillation frequency is set by fundamental physics and is therefore\nindependent of the details of the experiment. This signal is most easily\nobserved in the sub-MHz range, allowing detection when f_a is > 10^16 GeV, and\npossibly as low as 10^15 GeV.

Stars in the excess have a rotational velocity lower than\nthat of stars in the thick disk, and they may thus be confused with stars in\nthe inner galactic halo. The thick disk scale height increases with radius and\nthe rate of its increase is smaller for more gas rich primary galaxies. On the\ncontrary, the scale height of the stellar excess is independent of both radius\nand gas fraction. We also find that the post-merger thick disk has a radial\nscale length which is 10-50% larger than that of the thin disk. Two consecutive\nmergers have basically the same effect on heating the stellar disk as a single\nmerger of the same total mass. To investigate how thick disks produced through\nsecular processes may differ from those produced by minor mergers, we also\nsimulated gravitationally unstable gas-rich disks.

We find that disk-induced migration provides the dominant\nperturbation to the inspiral, with weaker effects from the mass accretion onto\nthe CO and hydrodynamic drag. Depending on whether a gap is present, the\nperturbation of the GW phase is between 10 and 1000 radians per year,\ndetectable with the future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) at high\nsignificance. The Fourier transform of the disk-modified GW in the stationary\nphase approximation is sensitive to disk parameters with a frequency trend\ndifferent from post-Newtonian vacuum corrections. Our results suggest that\nobservations of EMRIs may place new sensitive constraints on the physics of\naccretion disks. \n\n"}

However, numerous data from space and balloon-born missions and\nrecently from Herschel and Planck show that dust emission is not well\nunderstood, as revealed by the observed anti-correlation of beta with the grain\ntemperature. In order to give astronomers the necessary data to interpret\nFIR/submm observations, we synthesised analogues of interstellar amorphous and\ncrystalline silicate grains, rich in Mg and Ca, and having stiochiometry of\nolivine and pyroxene and measured their MAC, in the 100-1000/1500 \\mum range\nfor grain temperatures varying from 300 to 10 K. We find that the grain MAC\ndecreases when the grain temperature decreases and that the local spectral\nindex, beta, defined as the slope of the MAC curve, is anti-correlated with the\ngrain temperature. These variations, which are not observed in the crystallised\nsamples, are related to the amorphous nature of the samples. In addition, the\nspectral shape of the MAC is complex: at short wavelengths (lambda < 500/700\n\\mum), beta is in the range 1.6 - 2.1 for all grain temperature and grain\ncomposition whereas at longer wavelengths (lambda > 500/700 \\mum), beta < 2 for\nsamples with a pyroxene stoichiometry and beta > 2 for samples with an olivine\nstoichiometry.

We find that the\nnonthermal production of 'pure' wino or higgsino LSPs, i.e. weakly interacting\nmassive particles (WIMPs), in heavy gravitino decays can account for the\nobserved amount of dark matter while simultaneously fulfilling the constraints\nimposed by primordial nucleosynthesis and leptogenesis within a range of LSP,\ngravitino and neutrino masses. For instance, a mass of the lightest neutrino of\n0.05 eV would require a higgsino mass below 900 GeV and a gravitino mass of at\nleast 10 TeV. \n\n"}

The current excess in the diphoton\nchannel is twice that expected from a Standard Model Higgs; whilst this may\nwell change with more statistics, it is interesting to consider the\nimplications should the result persist. Here, we assess whether the NMSSM with\na neutralino dark matter candidate could explain this excess when astrophysical\nconstraints (e.g. no overproduction of gamma rays and radio emission in the\ngalaxy, no anomalous excess in the dark matter direct detection experiments and\nno dark matter overabundance) are imposed on the neutralino. This enables us to\ndisregard unphysical regions of the parameter space even though the Higgs\nsignal is compatible with the observed excess. The result of our analysis is\nthat there are configurations of the parameter space which can explain the\nsignal strength reported by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations for a Higgs mass\nwithin the required range. Should the observed signal strength finally be\ncompatible with Standard Model expectations, it would be difficult to\ndistinguish between the discovery of Standard Model Higgs and a SM-like Higgs\nfrom the NMSSM, unless one performs dedicated searches of very light Higgs\nbosons and possibly investigate peculiar signatures of supersymmetric\nparticles.

We have previously argued that filaments of cold (~10^4 K) gas\ncondense out of the intracluster medium (ICM) in hydrostatic and thermal\nequilibrium when the ratio of the thermal instability timescale to the\nfree-fall time $t_{TI}/t_{ff}$ falls below 5-10. This criterion corresponds to\nan upper limit on the density of the ICM and motivates a model in which a\ndensity core forms wherever $t_{TI}/t_{ff} \\lesssim 10$. Consistent with\nobservations and numerical simulations, this model predicts larger and more\ntenuous cores for lower-mass halos---while the core density in a cluster may be\nas large as ~ 0.1 cm^{-3}, the core density in the Galactic halo should not\nexceed ~ 10^{-4} cm^{-3}. We can also explain the large densities in smaller\nmass halos (galactic `coronae') if we include the contribution of the central\ngalaxy to the gravitational potential. Our models produce a favorable match to\nthe observational X-ray luminosity-temperature (Lx-Tx) relation. For halo\nmasses $\\lesssim 10^{13}$ Msun the core size approaches the virial radius.\nThus, most of the baryons in such halos cannot be in the hot ICM, but either in\nthe form of stars or in the form of hot gas beyond the virial radius. Because\nof the smaller mass in the ICM and much larger mass available for star\nformation, the majority of the baryons in low mass halos ($\\lesssim 10^{13}$\nMsun) can be expelled beyond the virial radius due to supernova feedback.

The ability to detect the directionality of recoil\nnuclei will considerably facilitate detection of WIMPs. In this paper we\npropose a novel type of dark matter detector: detectors made of DNA or RNA\ncould provide nanometer resolution for tracking, an energy threshold of 0.5\nkeV, and can operate at room temperature. When a WIMP from the Galactic Halo\nelastically scatters off of a nucleus in the detector, the recoiling nucleus\nthen traverses hundreds of strings of single stranded nucleic acids (ssNA) with\nknown base sequences and severs ssNA strands along its trajectory. The location\nof the break can be identified by amplifying and identifying the segments of\ncut ssNA using techniques well known to biologists. Thus the path of the\nrecoiling nucleus can be tracked to nanometer accuracy. In one such detector\nconcept, the transducers are nanometer-thick Au-foils of 1m x 1m, and the\ndirection of recoiling nuclei is measured by \"NA Tracking Chamber\" consisting\nof ordered array of ssNA strands.

While both direct detections and stacking suggest that the AGN\nfraction in sBzK galaxies is high, there is no clear evidence for widespread\nCompton thick activity in either the sBzK population generally, or the IR\nExcess sBzK subsample.

The hot-gas content of early-type galaxies:\n  fast versus slow rotators Abstract: For early-type galaxies, the ability to sustain a corona of hot, X-ray\nemitting gas could have played a key role in quenching their star-formation\nhistory. Yet, it is still unclear what drives the precise amount of hot gas\naround these galaxies. By combining photometric and spectroscopic measurements\nfor the early-type galaxies observed during the Atlas3D integral-field survey\nwith measurements of their X-ray luminosity based on X-ray data of both low and\nhigh spatial resolution we conclude that the hot-gas content of early-type\ngalaxies can depend on their dynamical structure. Specifically, whereas slow\nrotators generally have X-ray halos with luminosity L_X,gas and temperature T\nvalues that are in line with what is expected if the hot-gas emission is\nsustained by the thermalisaton of the kinetic energy carried by the\nstellar-mass loss material, fast rotators tend to display L_X,gas values that\nfall consistently below the prediction of this model, with similar T values\nthat do not scale with the stellar kinetic energy as observed in the case of\nslow rotators. Considering that fast rotators are likely to be intrinsically\nflatter than slow rotators, and that the few L_X,gas-deficient slow rotators\nalso happen to be relatively flat, the observed L_X,gas deficiency in these\nobjects would support the hypothesis whereby flatter galaxies have a harder\ntime in retaining their hot gas.

Here we develop a new test of the cosmic evolution of supermassive\nblack holes (SMBHs) in disk galaxies by considering the local population of\nSMBHs.

SMBHs exhibit a tight relation between their mass and the\nvelocity dispersion of the spheroid within which they reside, the M_BH-sigma\nrelation. In disk galaxies the bulge is the spheroid of interest. We explore\nthe evolution of the M_BH-sigma relation when bulges form together with SMBHs\non the M_BH-sigma relation and then slowly reform a disk around them. The\nformation of the disk compresses the bulge raising its sigma.

This\ncompression leads to an offset in the M_BH-sigma relation if it is not\naccompanied by an increased M_BH.

However, this assumption seems invalid in BLR models that\nconsists of an accretion disk and its wind. The disk is likely Keplerian and\ntherefore virialized. However, the wind material must, beyond a certain point,\nbe dominated by an outward force that is stronger than gravity. Here, we\nanalyze hydrodynamic simulations of four different disk winds: an isothermal\nwind, a thermal wind from an X-ray heated disk, and two line-driven winds, one\nwith and the other without X-ray heating and cooling. For each model, we check\nwhether gravity governs the flow properties, by computing and analyzing the\nvolume-integrated quantities that appear in the virial theorem: internal,\nkinetic, and gravitational energies, We find that in the first two models, the\nwinds are non-virialized whereas the two line-driven disk winds are virialized\nup to a relatively large distance. The line-driven winds are virialized because\nthey accelerate slowly so that the rotational velocity is dominant and the wind\nbase is very dense.

The properties of such\nPopulation III (Pop III) stars are thought to be very different than later\ngenerations, because cooling is dramatically different in gas with a\nmetallicity below a critical value Z_c, which lies between ~10^-6 and 10^-3\nsolar value. Z_c is much smaller than the typical average metallicity, <Z>, and\nthus the mixing efficiency of the pristine gas in the interstellar medium plays\na crucial role in the transition from Pop III to normal star formation. The\nsmall critical value, Z_c, corresponds to the far left tail of the probability\ndistribution function (PDF) of the metallicity. Based on closure models for the\nPDF formulation of turbulent mixing, we derive equations for the fraction of\ngas, P, lying below Z_c, in compressible turbulence. Our simulation data shows\nthat the evolution of the fraction P can be well approximated by a generalized\nself-convolution model, which predicts dP/dt = -n/tau_con P (1-P^(1/n)), where\nn is a measure of the locality of the PDF convolution and the timescale tau_con\nis determined by the rate at which turbulence stretches the pollutants. Using a\nsuite of simulations with Mach numbers ranging from M = 0.9 to 6.2, we provide\naccurate fits to n and tau_con as a function of M, Z_c/<Z>, and the scale, L_p,\nat which pollutants are added to the flow. For P>0.9, mixing occurs only in the\nregions surrounding the pollutants, such that n=1. For smaller P, n is larger\nas mixing becomes more global. We show how the results can be used to construct\none-zone models for the evolution of Pop III stars in a single high-redshift\ngalaxy, as well as subgrid models for tracking the evolution of the first stars\nin large cosmological simulations. \n\n"}

We calibrate and extensively test our method using a suite of cosmological\nsimulations of the formation of Milky Way-sized galaxies. Our best estimate of\nthe local Galactic escape speed, which we define as the minimum speed required\nto reach three virial radii $R_{340}$, is $533^{+54}_{-41}$ km/s (90%\nconfidence) with an additional 5% systematic uncertainty, where $R_{340}$ is\nthe Galactocentric radius encompassing a mean over-density of 340 times the\ncritical density for closure in the Universe. From the escape speed we further\nderive estimates of the mass of the Galaxy using a simple mass model with two\noptions for the mass profile of the dark matter halo: an unaltered and an\nadiabatically contracted Navarro, Frenk & White (NFW) sphere. If we fix the\nlocal circular velocity the latter profile yields a significantly higher mass\nthan the un-contracted halo, but if we instead use the statistics on halo\nconcentration parameters in large cosmological simulations as a constraint we\nfind very similar masses for both models. Our best estimate for $M_{340}$, the\nmass interior to $R_{340}$ (dark matter and baryons), is $1.3^{+0.4}_{-0.3}\n\\times 10^{12}$ M$_\\odot$ (corresponding to $M_{200} = 1.6^{+0.5}_{-0.4} \\times\n10^{12}$ M$_\\odot$).

The method computes the effect of multiple radiative sources using\nthe same tree algorithm used for gravity, so it is computationally efficient\nand well resolved. The method foregoes calculating absorption and scattering in\nfavour of a constant escape fraction for young stars to keep the calculation\nefficient enough to simulate the entire evolution of a galaxy in a cosmological\ncontext to the present day.

Precise experimental measurements of the Higgs couplings at the LHC\nand at the proposed next-generation facilities will allow for a robust test of\nthe phase transition dynamics. To illustrate this point, in this paper we focus\non the scenario in which loops of a new scalar field are responsible for the\nfirst-order phase transition, and study a selection of benchmark models with\nvarious SM gauge quantum numbers of the new scalar.

We also show\nthat, as for the HI, the extent of the H2 disc decreases with increasing\nHI-deficiency. These results show that cluster galaxies have, on average, a\nlower H2 content than similar objects in the field. The slope of the H2-def vs.\nHI-def relation is less than 1, while the D(HI)/D(i) vs. HI-def relation is\nsteeper than the D(CO)/D(i) vs. HI-def relation, thereby indicating that the H2\ngas is removed less efficiently than the HI. This result can be understood if\nthe HI is distributed on a flat disc more extended than the stellar disc, thus\nless anchored to the gravitational potential well of the galaxy than the H2.\nThere is a clear trend between the NUV-i colour and H2-def, which suggests that\nH2 removal quenches the activity of star formation. This causes galaxies\nmigrate from the blue cloud to the green valley and, eventually, to the red\nsequence. The total gas-consumption timescale of gas deficient cluster galaxies\nis comparable to that of isolated systems, and is significantly larger than the\ntypical timescale for total gas removal in a ram pressure stripping process,\nthus suggesting that ram pressure, rather than starvation, is the dominant\nprocess driving the evolution of these cluster galaxies. \n\n"}

The progenitor models\nfor the SNIa available in the literature propose different distributions for\nregulating the explosion times of these events. These functions are known as\nthe Delay Time Distributions (DTDs). This work is the first one in a series of\npapers aiming at studying five different DTDs for SNIa.

They are primarily associated with less massive black\nholes growing in high-density pseudo-bulges at a rate sufficient to produce the\ntotal mass budget in these black holes in ~10 Gyr. The circum-nuclear\nenvironment contains high density cold gas and associated star-formation. Major\nmergers are not the primary mechanism for transporting this gas inward; secular\nprocesses appear dominant.

Such processes are generically present in\nmulti-component DM scenarios or those with non-minimal DM stabilization\nsymmetries.

This implies that the central\ndynamical mass density scales almost linearly with the central baryonic\ndensity.

A distinct gravitationally self-bound solitonic core is found at the\ncenter of every halo, with a profile quite different from cores modeled in the\nwarm or self-interacting dark matter scenarios. Furthermore, we show that each\nsolitonic core is surrounded by an extended halo composed of large fluctuating\ndark matter granules which modulate the halo density on a scale comparable to\nthe diameter of the solitonic core. The scaling symmetry of the SP equation and\nthe uncertainty principle tightly relate the core mass to the halo specific\nenergy, which, in the context of cosmological structure formation, leads to a\nsimple scaling between core mass ($M_c$) and halo mass ($M_h$), $M_c \\propto\na^{-1/2} M_h^{1/3}$, where $a$ is the cosmic scale factor. We verify this\nscaling relation by (i) examining the internal structure of a statistical\nsample of virialized halos that form in our 3D cosmological simulations, and by\n(ii) merging multiple solitons to create individual virialized objects.\nSufficient simulation resolution is achieved by adaptive mesh refinement and\ngraphic processing units acceleration.

This class of models can accommodate larger\nYukawa couplings, which give simultaneous fits to charged-lepton and neutrino\nmasses, by invoking either cancellations or specific symmetry-textures for\nDirac ($M_D$) and Majorana ($M_N$) masses in the seesaw formula.

We highlight that in the interesting scenario\nwhere this particle has a weak scale mass, this out-of-equilibrium condition\nrequires a proper decay length larger than O(1) mm. Such new fields are within\nreach of the LHC, at which they can be pair produced leaving a distinctive,\ndisplaced-vertex signature. This scenario is realized in the recently proposed\nmechanism of baryogenesis where the baryon asymmetry is produced through the\nfreeze-out and subsequent decay of a meta-stable weakly interacting massive\nparticle (\"WIMP baryogenesis\"). In analogy to missing energy searches for WIMP\ndark matter, the LHC is an excellent probe of these new long-lived particles\nresponsible for baryogenesis via the low-background displaced vertex channel.\nIn our paper, we estimate the limits on simplified models inspired by WIMP\nbaryogenesis from two of the most sensitive collider searches by CMS and ATLAS\nwith 8 TeV LHC data.

Such a calibration\nshould include well understood correlations with halo mass, and the possibility\nto identify galaxies which dominate their potential well (centrals), and their\nsatellites. Focusing on z = 1 and 2 we propose a method of environmental\ncalibration which can be applied to the next generation of low to medium\nresolution spectroscopic surveys. Using an up-to-date semi-analytic model of\ngalaxy formation, we measure the local density of galaxies in fixed apertures\non different scales. There is a clear correlation of density with halo mass for\nsatellite galaxies, while a significant population of low mass centrals is\nfound at high densities in the neighbourhood of massive haloes. In this case\nthe density simply traces the mass of the most massive halo within the\naperture. To identify central and satellite galaxies, we apply an\nobservationally motivated stellar mass rank method which is both highly pure\nand complete, especially in the more massive haloes where such a division is\nmost meaningful. Finally we examine a test case for the recovery of\nenvironmental trends: the passive fraction of galaxies and its dependence on\nstellar and halo mass for centrals and satellites. With careful calibration,\nobservationally defined quantities do a good job of recovering known trends in\nthe model. This result stands even with reduced redshift accuracy, provided the\nsample is deep enough to preserve a wide dynamic range of density. \n\n"}

Abstract: Star formation is observed to be suppressed in group and cluster galaxies\ncompared to the field. To gain insight into the quenching process, we have\nanalysed ~2000 galaxies formed in the GIMIC suite of cosmological\nhydrodynamical simulations. The time of quenching varies from ~2 Gyr before\naccretion (first crossing of r200,c) to >4 Gyr after, depending on satellite\nand host mass. Once begun, quenching is rapid (>~ 500 Myr) in low-mass galaxies\n(M* < 10^10 M_Sun), but significantly more protracted for more massive\nsatellites. The simulations predict a substantial role of outflows driven by\nram pressure -- but not tidal forces -- in removing the star-forming\ninterstellar matter (ISM) from satellite galaxies, especially dwarfs (M* ~ 10^9\nM_Sun) where they account for nearly two thirds of ISM loss in both groups and\nclusters. Immediately before quenching is complete, this fraction rises to ~80%\neven for Milky Way analogues (M* ~ 10^10.5 M_Sun) in groups (M_host ~ 10^13.5\nM_Sun). We show that (i) ISM stripping was significantly more effective at\nearly times than at z = 0; (ii) approximately half the gas is stripped from\n`galactic fountains' and half directly from the star forming disk; (iii)\ngalaxies undergoing stripping experience ram pressure up to ~100 times the\naverage at a given group/cluster-centric radius, because they are\npreferentially located in overdense ICM regions. Remarkably, stripping causes\nat most half the loss of the extended gas haloes surrounding our simulated\nsatellites.

Radio phoenixes are\naged radio galaxy lobes whose emission is reactivated by compression or other\nmechanisms. Here, we present the detection of a radio phoenix close to the\nmoment of its formation. The source is located in Abell 1033, a peculiar galaxy\ncluster which underwent a recent merger. To support our claim, we present\nunpublished Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope and Chandra observations\ntogether with archival data from the Very Large Array and the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey. We discover the presence of two sub-clusters displaced along the N-S\ndirection. The two sub-clusters probably underwent a recent merger which is the\ncause of a moderately perturbed X-ray brightness distribution. A steep-spectrum\nextended radio source very close to an AGN is proposed to be a newly born radio\nphoenix: the AGN lobes have been displaced/compressed by shocks formed during\nthe merger event. This scenario explains the source location, morphology,\nspectral index, and brightness. Finally, we show evidence of a density\ndiscontinuity close to the radio phoenix and discuss the consequences of its\npresence. \n\n"}

The orbital histories of these satellites provide the\nkey to understanding the role of the MW/M31 halo, lower-mass groups, and cosmic\nreionization on the evolution of dwarf galaxies. We examine the virial-infall\nhistories of satellites with M_star = 10^{3-9} M_sun using the ELVIS suite of\ncosmological zoom-in dissipationless simulations of 48 MW/M31-like halos.\nSatellites at z = 0 fell into the MW/M31 halos typically 5 - 8 Gyr ago at z =\n0.5 - 1. However, they first fell into any host halo typically 7 - 10 Gyr ago\nat z = 0.7 - 1.5. This difference arises because many satellites experienced\n\"group preprocessing\" in another host halo, typically of M_vir ~ 10^{10-12}\nM_sun, before falling into the MW/M31 halos. Satellites with lower mass and/or\nthose closer to the MW/M31 fell in earlier and are more likely to have\nexperienced group preprocessing; half of all satellites with M_star < 10^6\nM_sun were preprocessed in a group. Infalling groups also drive most\nsatellite-satellite mergers within the MW/M31 halos. Finally, none of the\nsurviving satellites at z = 0 were within the virial radius of their MW/M31\nhalo during reionization (z > 6), and only < 4% were satellites of any other\nhost halo during reionization. Thus, effects of cosmic reionization versus\nhost-halo environment on the formation histories of surviving dwarf galaxies in\nthe LG occurred at distinct epochs, separated typically by 2 - 4 Gyr, so they\nare separable theoretically and, in principle, observationally. \n\n"}

A\ndetailed study of several calorimetric detectors suggests that a mismatch\nbetween the sensor and signal bandwidths is the primary reason for suppressed\nsensitivity. With this understanding, we propose a detector design in which a\nthin-film Au pad is directly deposited onto a massive absorber that is then\nthermally linked to a separately fabricated TES chip via an Au wirebond,\nproviding large electron-phonon coupling (i.e. high signal bandwidth), ease of\nfabrication, and cosmogenic background suppression.

Luminosity functions from UV to NIR wavelengths\ndiffer from observations at a level comparable to systematic shifts resulting\nfrom a choice between Petrosian and Kron photometric apertures. Despite the\ngenerally good agreement there are clear discrepancies with observations. The\nblue cloud of EAGLE galaxies extends to somewhat higher luminosities than in\nthe data, consistent with the modest underestimate of the passive fraction in\nmassive EAGLE galaxies. There is also a moderate excess of bright blue galaxies\ncompared to observations. The overall level of agreement with the observed\ncolour distribution suggests that EAGLE galaxies at z = 0.1 have ages,\nmetallicities and levels of obscuration that are comparable to those of\nobserved galaxies. \n\n"}

We examine radii ~0.1-100 pc around a black hole (BH), where the\naccretion rate onto the BH is determined and where AGN-powered winds and\nradiation couple to the ISM. We conclude: (1) The BH accretion rate is\ndetermined by exchange of angular momentum between gas and stars in\ngravitational instabilities. This produces accretion rates ~0.03-1 Msun/yr,\nsufficient to power luminous AGN. (2) The gas disk in the galactic nucleus\nundergoes an initial burst of star formation followed by several Myrs where\nstellar feedback suppresses the star formation rate (SFR).

Both\ngalaxies are detected by both Chandra and NuSTAR, which together provide the\nfirst-ever spectra of these two galaxies spanning 0.3-30 keV. The X-ray\nemission from both galaxies is spatially resolved by Chandra; we find that hot\ngas dominates the E < 1-3 keV emission while ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs)\ndominate at E > 1-3 keV. The NuSTAR galaxy-wide spectra of both galaxies follow\nsteep power-law distributions with Gamma ~ 2.6 at E > 5-7 keV, similar to the\nspectra of bright individual ULXs and other galaxies that have been studied by\nNuSTAR. We find that both NGC 3256 and NGC 3310 have X-ray detected sources\ncoincident with nuclear regions; however, the steep NuSTAR spectra of both\ngalaxies restricts these sources to be either low luminosity AGN or non-AGN in\nnature (e.g., ULXs or crowded X-ray sources that reach L2-10 keV ~ 10^40 erg/s\ncannot be ruled out). Combining our constraints on the 0.3-30 keV spectra of\nNGC 3256 and NGC 3310 with equivalent measurements for nearby star-forming\ngalaxies M83 and NGC 253, we analyze the SFR-normalized spectra of these\nstarburst galaxies.

Most studies so far have focused on large\ngalaxies, but dwarfs might also experience such events, since the halo mass\nfunction is scale-free in the concordance cosmological model. Notably, because\nof their low mass, most of their interactions will be with dark satellites. In\nthis paper we follow the evolution of gas-rich disky dwarf galaxies as they\nexperience a minor merger with a dark satellite. We aim to characterize the\neffects of such an interaction on the dwarf's star formation, morphology, and\nkinematical properties. We performed a suite of carefully set-up hydrodynamical\nsimulations of dwarf galaxies that include dark matter, gas, and stars merging\nwith a satellite consisting solely of dark matter. For the host system we vary\nthe gas fraction, disk size and thickness, halo mass, and concentration, while\nwe explore different masses, concentrations, and orbits for the satellite. We\nfind that the interactions cause strong starbursts of both short and long\nduration in the dwarfs. Their star formation rates increase by factors of a few\nto 10 or more. They are strongest for systems with extended gas disks and high\ngas fractions merging with a high-concentration satellite on a planar, radial\norbit. In contrast to analogous simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies, many of\nthe systems experience strong morphological changes and become spheroidal even\nin the presence of significant amounts of gas. The simulated systems compare\nremarkably well with the observational properties of a large selection of\nirregular dwarf galaxies and blue compact dwarfs. This implies that mergers\nwith dark satellites might well be happening but not be fully evident, and may\nthus play a role in the diversity of the dwarf galaxy population. \n\n"}

Void galaxies lie in the most under dense\nparts of our universe and a significant fraction of them are gas rich, late\ntype spiral galaxies. Although isolated, they have ongoing star formation but\nappear to be slowly evolving compared to galaxies in denser environments. Not\nmuch is known about their star formation properties or cold gas content. In\nthis study we searched for molecular gas in five void galaxies. The galaxies\nwere selected based on their relatively high IRAS fluxes or Ha line\nluminosities, both of which signify ongoing star formation. All five galaxies\nappear to be isolated and two lie within the Bootes void. We detected CO line\nemission from four of the five galaxies in our sample and the molecular gas\nmasses lie between 10^8 to 10^9 Msolar.

We present an\nindirect method to detect the presence of a hot bubble using hydrostatic\nphotoionization calculations of the cold (~10^4 K) line-emitting gas. We\ncompare our calculations with observations of the broad line region, the inner\nface of the torus, the narrow line region (NLR), and the extended NLR, and thus\nconstrain the hot gas pressure at distances 0.1 pc -- 10 kpc from the center.\nWe find that emission line ratios observed in the average quasar spectrum are\nconsistent with radiation-pressure-dominated models on all scales. On scales\n<40 pc a dynamically significant hot gas pressure is ruled out, while on larger\nscales the hot gas pressure cannot exceed six times the local radiation\npressure. In individual quasars, ~25% of quasars exhibit NLR ratios that are\ninconsistent with radiation-pressure-dominated models, though in these objects\nthe hot gas pressure is also unlikely to exceed the radiation pressure by an\norder of magnitude or more.

Employing radiative transfer we model the effect\nof multi-frequency (0.76 eV - 60 eV) radiation on a collapsing halo at high\nredshift.

Here we propose an alternative scenario based\non radiatively inefficient super-critical accretion of stellar-mass holes\nembedded in the gaseous circum-nuclear discs (CNDs) expected to exist in the\ncores of high redshift galaxies. Our sub-pc resolution hydrodynamical\nsimulations show that stellar-mass holes orbiting within the central 100 pc of\nthe CND bind to very high density gas clumps that arise from the fragmentation\nof the surrounding gas. Owing to the large reservoir of dense cold gas\navailable, a stellar-mass black hole allowed to grow at super-Eddington rates\naccording to the \"slim disc\" solution can increase its mass by 3 orders of\nmagnitudes within a few million years. These findings are supported by\nsimulations run with two different hydro codes, RAMSES based on the Adaptive\nMesh Refinement technique and GIZMO based on a new Lagrangian Godunov-type\nmethod, and with similar, but not identical, sub-grid recipes for star\nformation, supernova feedback, black hole accretion and feedback. The low\nradiative efficiency of super-critical accretion flows are instrumental to the\nrapid mass growth of our black holes, as they imply modest radiative heating of\nthe surrounding nuclear environment. \n\n"}

Both sets of galaxies extend over the\nsame range in stellar mass (7.5 < logM < 10.5), size (0.5 < R < 3.0 kpc), and\nstar-formation rate (~1 < SFR < 100). Remarkably, a comparison of the most\ncommonly used physical and morphological parameters -- stellar mass, half-light\nradius, UV slope, star formation rate, ellipticity, nearest neighbor distance,\nstar formation surface density, specific star formation rate, [O III]\nluminosity, and [O III] equivalent width -- reveals no statistically\nsignificant differences between the populations. This suggests that the\nprocesses and conditions which regulate the escape of Ly-alpha from a z ~ 2\nstar-forming galaxy do not depend on these quantities. In particular, the lack\nof dependence on the UV slope suggests that Ly-alpha emission is not being\nsignificantly modulated by diffuse dust in the interstellar medium. We develop\na simple model of Ly-alpha emission that connects LAEs to all high-redshift\nstar forming galaxies where the escape of Ly-alpha depends on the sightline\nthrough the galaxy.

We find\nthat the accretion rate of BHs embedded in bulges is proportional to\nr_{B,eff}/r_B, where r_{B,eff} is the increased effective Bondi radius that\nincludes the gravitational potential of the bulge, and r_B is the Bondi radius\nof the BH. The radiative feedback from the BH suppresses the cold accretion\nrate to ~1 percent of the Bondi rate when a bulge is not considered. However,\nwe find that the BH fueling rate increases rapidly when the bulge mass M_bulge\nis greater than the critical value of 10^6 M_sun and is proportional to\nM_bulge. Since the critical bulge mass is independent of the central BH mass\nM_{BH}, the growth rate of BHs with masses of 10^2, 10^4, and 10^6 M_sun\nexhibits distinct dependencies on the bulge-to-BH mass ratio. Our results imply\nthat light seed BHs (<= 10^2 M_sun) which might be the remnants of the Pop III\nstars, cannot grow through accretion coevally with the early assembly of the\nbulge of the host galaxies until the bulge reaches the critical mass.

ADMonium is a natural consequence of the\nbasic features of ADM: the (complex scalar) ADM is charged under a dark local\n$U(1)_d$ symmetry which is broken at a low scale and provides a light gauge\nboson $X$. The dark gauge coupling is strong and then ADM can annihilate away\ninto $X$-pair effectively. Therefore, the ADM can form bound state due to its\nlarge self-interaction via $X$ mediation. To explore the collider signature of\nADMonium, we propose that ADM has a two-Higgs doublet portal.

Wide-field near-IR surveys with HST are generally inefficient,\nas guide star acquisitions make it impractical to observe more than one\npointing per orbit. This limitation can be circumvented by guiding with gyros\nalone, which is possible as long as the telescope has three functional gyros.\nThe method presented here allows us to observe mosaics of eight independent\nWFC3-IR pointings in a single orbit by utilizing the fact that HST drifts by\nonly a very small amount in the 25 seconds between non-destructive reads of\nunguided exposures. By shifting the reads and treating them as independent\nexposures the full resolution of WFC3 can be restored.

We find that the mass estimators of Walker et al. and Wolf et al.\nare able to recover the masses of dispersion-dominated systems with little\nsystematic bias, but with a 1-sigma scatter of 25 and 23 percent, respectively.\nThe error on the estimated mass is dominated by the impact of the 3D shape of\nthe stellar mass distribution, which is difficult to constrain observationally.\nThis intrinsic scatter becomes the dominant source of uncertainty in the masses\nestimated for galaxies like the dwarf spheroidal (dSph) satellites of the Milky\nWay, where the observational errors in their sizes and velocity dispersions are\nsmall. Such scatter may also affect the inner density slopes of dSphs derived\nfrom multiple stellar populations, relaxing the significance with which\nNavarro-Frenk-White profiles may be excluded, depending on the degree to which\nthe relevant properties of the different stellar populations are correlated.\nFinally, we derive a new optimal mass estimator that removes the residual\nbiases and achieves a statistically significant reduction in the scatter to 20\npercent overall for dispersion-dominated galaxies, allowing more precise and\naccurate mass estimates. \n\n"}

The expected scale of\nthe demand at the 2025 timescale is at least two orders of magnitude -- and in\nsome cases greater -- than that available currently. 2) The growth rate of data\nproduced by simulations is overwhelming the current ability, of both facilities\nand researchers, to store and analyze it. Additional resources and new\ntechniques for data analysis are urgently needed. 3) Data rates and volumes\nfrom HEP experimental facilities are also straining the ability to store and\nanalyze large and complex data volumes. Appropriately configured\nleadership-class facilities can play a transformational role in enabling\nscientific discovery from these datasets. 4) A close integration of HPC\nsimulation and data analysis will aid greatly in interpreting results from HEP\nexperiments. Such an integration will minimize data movement and facilitate\ninterdependent workflows. 5) Long-range planning between HEP and ASCR will be\nrequired to meet HEP's research needs.

The mainstream response to this\nconundrum is to invoke large quantities of `dark matter' -- which purportedly\nsupplies the needed extra gravity -- and also of `dark energy', to account for\nfurther anomalies in cosmology, such as the observed, accelerated expansion.\nThe MOND paradigm offers a different solution: a breakdown of standard dynamics\n(gravity and/or inertia) in the limit of low accelerations -- below some\nacceleration $a_0$. In this limit, dynamics become space-time scale invariant,\nand is controlled by a gravitational constant $\\mathcal{A}_0\\equiv Ga_0$, which\nreplaces Newton's $G$. With the new dynamics, the various detailed\nmanifestations of the anomalies in galaxies are predicted with no need for dark\nmatter. The cosmological anomalies could, but need not have to do with small\naccelerations. For example, the need for dark matter in accounting for the\nexpansion history of the Universe is eliminated if the relevant gravitational\nconstant is $\\approx 2\\pi G$. Such a `renormalization' of $G$ could be a\ndimensionless parameter of a MOND theory.

There are MOND\ntheories in which this `coincidence' is natural. I draw on enlightening\nhistorical and conceptual analogies from quantum theory to limelight aspects of\nMOND. I also explain how MOND may have strong connections with effects of the\nquantum vacuum on local dynamics. \n\n"}

However, we have\nlimited understanding of its physics and distribution in all but the nearest\ngalaxies. We present a new technique for studying the composition and\ndistribution of molecular gas in high-redshift galaxies inaccessible to\nexisting methods. Our proposed approach is an extension of carbon monoxide\nintensity mapping methods, which have garnered significant experimental\ninterest in recent years. These intensity mapping surveys target the 115 GHz\n$^{12}$CO (1-0) line, but also contain emission from the substantially fainter\n110 GHz $^{13}$CO (1-0) transition. The method leverages the information\ncontained in the $^{13}$CO line by cross-correlating pairs of frequency\nchannels in an intensity mapping survey. Since $^{13}$CO is emitted from the\nsame medium as the $^{12}$CO, but saturates at a much higher column density,\nthis cross-correlation provides valuable information about both the gas density\ndistribution and isotopologue ratio, inaccessible from the $^{12}$CO alone.\nUsing a simple model of these molecular emission lines, we show that a future\nintensity mapping survey can constrain the abundance ratio of these two species\nand the fraction of emission from optically thick regions to order $\\sim30\\%$.\nThese measurements cannot be made by traditional CO observations, and\nconsequently the proposed method will provide unique insight into the physics\nof star formation, feedback, and galactic ecology at high redshifts. \n\n"}

First, the detection of one or a few\nphotons may be technologically easier. Second, since no electric field is\nrequired to detect the photons, there may be far fewer dark counts mimicking a\nDM signal.

In this\npaper, we set firmer constraints on the evolutionary pathways of the most\nmassive central galaxies by making use of empirical estimates on their\nabundances and stellar ages. The most recent abundance matching and direct\nmeasurements strongly favour that a substantial fraction of massive galaxies\nwith Mstar>3x10^11 Msun reside at the centre of clusters with mass\nMhalo>3x10^13 Msun. Spectral analysis supports ages >10 Gyrs, corresponding to\na formation redshift z_form >2. We combine these two pieces of\nobservationally-based evidence with the mass accretion history of their host\ndark matter haloes. We find that in these massive haloes, the stellar mass\nlocked up in the central galaxy is comparable to, if not greater than, the\ntotal baryonic mass at z_form. These findings indicate that either only a\nrelatively minor fraction of their present-day stellar mass was formed in-situ\nat z_form, or that these massive, central galaxies form in the extreme scenario\nwhere almost all of the baryons in the progenitor halo are converted into\nstars. Interestingly, the latter scenario would not allow for any substantial\nsize growth since the galaxy's formation epoch either via mergers or expansion.\nWe show our results hold irrespective of systematic uncertainties in stellar\nmass, abundances, galaxy merger rates, stellar initial mass function, star\nformation rate and dark matter accretion histories. \n\n"}

Here\nwe consider another possibility, where the perturbation is instead due to the\npotential of a galaxy cluster. Using $N$-body simulations we investigate the\nformation and evolution of spiral arms in a Milky Way-like galaxy orbiting a\nVirgo-like cluster. The galaxy is placed on a few orbits of different size but\nsimilar eccentricity and its evolution is followed for 10 Gyr. The tidally\ninduced, two-armed, approximately logarithmic spiral structure forms on each of\nthem during the pericenter passages. The spiral arms dissipate and wind up with\ntime, to be triggered again at the next pericenter passage. We confirm this\ntransient and recurrent nature of the arms by analyzing the time evolution of\nthe pitch angle and the arm strength. We find that the strongest arms are\nformed on the tightest orbit, however they wind up rather quickly and are\ndisturbed by another pericenter passage. The arms on the most extended orbit,\nwhich we analyze in more detail, wind up slowly and survive for the longest\ntime.

Stars of the same age are thicker in the\nouter disk than in the inner disk (flaring). These lead to positive vertical\nage gradients and negative radial age gradients.

The formation histories, and thus ages, of dark matter halos\ncorrelate with their large-scale density $\\rho$, an effect known as assembly\nbias. We test whether this correlation extends to galaxies by measuring the\ndependence of galaxy stellar age on $\\rho$. To clarify the comparison between\ntheory and observation, and to remove the strong environmental effects on\nsatellites, we use galaxy group catalogs to identify central galaxies and\nmeasure their quenched fraction, $f_Q$, as a function of large-scale\nenvironment. Models that match halo age to central galaxy age predict a strong\npositive correlation between $f_Q$ and $\\rho$. However, we show that the\namplitude of this effect depends on the definition of halo age: assembly bias\nis significantly reduced when removing the effects of splashback halos---those\nhalos that are central but have passed through a larger halo or experienced\nstrong tidal encounters. Defining age using halo mass at its peak value rather\nthan current mass removes these effects. In SDSS data, at M$_{\\rm gal}\\gtrsim\n10^{10.0}$ M_sol/h$^2$, there is a $\\sim 5\\%$ increase in $f_Q$ from low to\nhigh densities, which is in agreement with predictions of dark matter halos\nusing peak halo mass. At lower stellar mass there is little to no correlation\nof $f_Q$ with $\\rho$. For these galaxies, age-matching is inconsistent with the\ndata across the wide range the halo formation metrics that we tested. This\nimplies that halo formation history has a small but statistically significant\nimpact on quenching of star formation at high masses, while the quenching\nprocess in low-mass central galaxies is uncorrelated with halo formation\nhistory. \n\n"}

Highly dimensional likelihoods are calculated over the mass of\nthe weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) and multiple EFT coupling\ncoefficients, which can then be used to set limits on these parameters and\nchoose models (EFT operators) that best fit the direct detection data.\nExpanding the parameter space beyond the standard spin-independent isoscalar\ncross section and WIMP mass reduces tensions between previously published\nexperiments. Combining these experiments to form a single joint likelihood\nleads to stronger limits than when each experiment is considered on its own.\nSimulations using two nonstandard operators (3 and 8) are used to test the\nproposed analysis technique in up to five dimensions and demonstrate the\nimportance of using multiple likelihood projections when determining\nconstraints on WIMP mass and EFT coupling coefficients.

Here we analyse the stability of a large sample of nearby\nstar-forming spirals treating molecular gas, atomic gas and stars as three\ndistinct components, and using radial profiles of sigma_CO and sigma_HI derived\nfrom HERACLES and THINGS observations. We show that the radial variations of\nsigma_CO and sigma_HI have a weak effect on the local stability level of galaxy\ndiscs, which remains remarkably flat and well above unity, but is low enough to\nensure (marginal) instability against non-axisymmetric perturbations and gas\ndissipation. More importantly, the radial variation of sigma_CO has a strong\nimpact on the size of the regions over which gravitational instabilities\ndevelop, and results in a characteristic instability scale that is one order of\nmagnitude larger than the Toomre length of molecular gas.

In particular, 85% of the cumulative SFHs are\nfitted to within a maximum error of 5% of the total stellar mass formed, and\n99% to within 10%. The log-normal performs systematically better than the\ncommonly used delayed-tau model, and is superseded only by functions with more\nthan three free parameters.

The contributions from dark matter co-annihilation channels are highly\nrelevant for a determination of the correct relic abundance. We investigate\nthese effects as well as the discovery potential for dark matter\nco-annihilation partners at the LHC. A small mass splitting between the dark\nmatter and its partner is preferred by the co-annihilation mechanism and\nsuggests that the co-annihilation partners may be long-lived (stable or\nmeta-stable) at collider scales.

Over the stellar mass range $10^{9.7} \\le M_\\ast/M_\\odot \\le 10^{10.9}$,\nwe find minimal statistical evidence for conformity.

For models\nwith strong correlations between halo and stellar age, the conformity signal is\ntoo large to be consistent with the data. For weaker implementations of\nage-matching, galactic conformity is not a sensitive diagnostic of halo\nassembly bias, and would not produce a detectable signal in SDSS data.

Further science cases include galaxy\nevolution, Milky Way structure, detection of high-redshift clusters, and\nfinding rare sources such as strong lenses and quasars.

Photometric redshifts have been derived using both Bayesian template\nfitting, and machine-learning techniques.

We find that frequent mergers in high-redshift\nproto-galaxies could provide a fertile environment to produce long-lasting\nbound star clusters.

We study in detail how\nionizing radiation can leak from high redshift galaxies. For this purpose, we\nuse a series of high resolution radiation hydrodynamics simulations, zooming on\nthree dwarf galaxies in a cosmological context.

In the absence of supernovae, photons are absorbed\nvery locally, within the birth clouds of massive stars.

In this work we reduce this degeneracy by\ncombining weak lensing together with strong lensing and stellar kinematics. Our\nanalysis is based on two galaxy samples: 45 strong lenses from the SLACS survey\nand 1,700 massive quiescent galaxies from the SDSS main spectroscopic sample\nwith weak lensing measurements from the Hyper Suprime-Cam survey. We use a\nBayesian hierarchical approach to jointly model all three observables. We fit\nthe data with models of varying complexity and show that a model with a radial\ngradient in the stellar mass-to-light ratio is required to simultaneously\ndescribe both galaxy samples. This result is driven by a subset of strong\nlenses with very steep total density profile, that cannot be fitted by models\nwith no gradient.

In this work, we extend our study to investigate the radial\nprofile of gas and stellar metallicity in local star-forming galaxies using\nspatially resolved spectroscopic data from the SDSS-IV MaNGA survey. We find\nthat most galaxies show negative gradients in both gas and stellar metallicity\nwith steeper gradients in stellar metallicity. The stellar metallicity gradient\ntend to be mass dependent with steeper gradients in more massive galaxies while\nno clear mass dependence is found for the gas metallicity gradient. Then we\ncompare the observations with the predictions from a chemical evolution model\nof the radial profiles of gas and stellar metallicities.

Such processes can be coherent provided\nthat the net electron recoil momentum, i.e. the momentum transfer from the\nneutrino minus the momentum of the emitted photon, is sufficiently small. The\nradiative processes is an attractive possibility as the energy of the emitted\nphotons can be as large as the momentum transfer to the electron system and\ntherefore the problem of detecting extremely low energy recoils can be avoided.\nThe requirement of macroscopic coherence severely constrains the phase space\navailable for the scattered particle and the emitted photon.

The host mass distribution is bimodal,\nand galaxies that suffered their $\\Gamma_{\\rm SFR}^{\\rm SD}$ in massive hosts\n($10^{13.5}\\rm M_{\\odot} \\lesssim M_{host} \\lesssim 10^{14.0}M_{\\odot}$) are\nmainly processed within the clusters. Pre-processing mainly limits the total\nstellar mass with which galaxies arrive in the clusters. Regarding quenching,\ngalaxies preferentially reach this state in high-mass halos ($10^{13.5}\\rm\nM_{\\odot} \\lesssim M_{host} \\lesssim 10^{14.5}M_{\\odot}$). The small fraction\nof galaxies that reach the cluster already quenched has also been\npre-processed, linking both criteria as different stages in the quenching\nprocess of those galaxies. For the $z=0$ satellite populations, we find a sharp\nrise in the fraction of quenched satellites at the time of first infall,\nhighlighting the role played by the dense cluster environment. Interestingly,\nthe fraction of pre-quenched galaxies rises with final cluster mass. This is a\ndirect consequence of the hierarchical cosmological model used in these\nsimulations. \n\n"}

Various tests have been proposed to test this\nhypothesis. One of the cleanest tests is the lensing of fast radio bursts. In\nthis situation, the presence of a compact object near the line of sight\nproduces two images of the radio burst. If the images are sufficiently\nseparated in time, this technique can constrain the presence of primordial\nblack holes. One can also try to detect the lensed image of the mini-bursts\nwithin the main burst. We show that this technique can produce the leading\nconstraints over a wide range in lens masses $\\gtrsim$ 2 $M_\\odot$ if the\nprimordial black holes follow a single mass distribution. Even if the\nprimordial black holes have an extended mass distribution, the constraints that\ncan be derived from lensing of fast radio bursts will be the most constraining\nover wide ranges of the parameter space. We show that this technique can probe\nexotic compact boson stars and fermion stars made up of beyond the Standard\nModel particles. This search strategy is competitive and can provide the\nleading constraints on parts of the particle physics parameter space when\ncompared with gravitational wave observations. \n\n"}

{"id": "1901.11036", "contents": "Title: Black hole scaling relations of active and quiescent galaxies:\n  Addressing selection effects and constraining virial factors Abstract: Local samples of quiescent galaxies with dynamically measured black hole\nmasses (Mbh) may suffer from an angular resolution-related selection effect,\nwhich could bias the observed scaling relations between Mbh and host galaxy\nproperties away from the intrinsic relations. In particular, previous work has\nshown that the observed Mbh-Mstar (stellar mass) relation is more strongly\nbiased than the Mbh-sigma (velocity dispersion) relation. Local samples of\nactive galactic nuclei (AGN) do not suffer from this selection effect, as in\nthese samples Mbh is estimated from megamasers and/or reverberation\nmapping-based techniques. With the exception of megamasers, Mbh-estimates in\nthese AGN samples are proportional to a virial coefficient fvir. Direct\nmodelling of the broad line region suggests that fvir~3.5. However, this\nresults in a Mbh-Mstar relation for AGN which lies below and is steeper than\nthe one observed for quiescent black hole samples. A similar though milder\ntrend is seen for the Mbh-sigma relation. Matching the high-mass end of the\nMbh-Mstar and Mbh-sigma relations observed in quiescent samples requires\nfvir~15 and fvir~7, respectively. On the other hand, fvir~3.5 yields Mbh-sigma\nand Mbh-Mstar relations for AGN which are remarkably consistent with the\nexpected `intrinsic' correlations for quiescent samples (i.e., once account has\nbeen made of the angular resolution-related selection effect), providing\nadditional evidence that the sample of local quiescent black holes is biased.\nWe also show that, as is the case for quiescent black holes, the Mbh-Mstar\nscaling relation of AGN is driven by velocity dispersion, thus providing\nadditional key constraints to black hole-galaxy co-evolution models. \n\n"}

We had previously identified these sources as candidates for\na sharply inverted integrated radio spectrum whose slope is close to, or even\nexceeds $\\alpha_c$ = +2.5, the theoretical limit due to synchrotron\nself-absorption (SSA) in a source of incoherent synchrotron radiation arising\nfrom relativistic particles with the canonical (i.e., power-law) energy\ndistribution.

These sources,\ntogether with another one or two reported in very recent literature, may well\nbe the archetypes of an extremely rare class, from the standpoint of violation\nof the SSA limit in compact extragalactic radio sources.
