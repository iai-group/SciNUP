{"id": "0804.0054", "contents": "Title: Formalism Locality in Quantum Theory and Quantum Gravity Abstract: We expect a theory of Quantum Gravity to be both probabilistic and have\nindefinite causal structure. Indefinite causal structure poses particular\nproblems for theory formulation since many of the core ideas used in the usual\napproaches to theory construction depend on having definite causal structure.\nFor example, the notion of a state across space evolving in time requires that\nwe have some definite causal structure so we can define a state on a space-like\nhypersurface. We will see that many of these problems are mitigated if we are\nable to formulate the theory in a \"formalism local\" (or F-local) fashion. A\nformulation of a physical theory is said to be F-local if, in making\npredictions for any given arbitrary space-time region, we need only refer to\nmathematical objects pertaining to that region. This is a desirable property\nboth on the grounds of efficiency and since, if we have indefinite causal\nstructure, it is not clear how to select some other space-time region on which\nour calculations may depend. The usual ways of formulating physical theories\n(the time evolving state picture, the histories approach, and the local\nequations approach) are not F-local.\n  We set up a framework for probabilistic theories with indefinite causal\nstructure. This, the causaloid framework, is F-local. We describe how Quantum\nTheory can be formulated in the causaloid framework (in an F-local fashion).\nThis provides yet another formulation of Quantum Theory.

We first verify that CS modified gravity\nleads to a theory with torsion, where this tensor is given by an antisymmetric\nproduct of the Riemann tensor and derivatives of the CS coupling. We then\ncalculate the torsion in the far field of a weakly gravitating source within\nthe parameterized post-Newtonian formalism, and specialize the result to Earth.\nWe find that CS torsion vanishes only if the coupling vanishes, thus\ngenerically leading to a modification of gyroscopic precession, irrespective of\nthe coupling choice. Perhaps most interestingly, we couple fermions to CS\nmodified gravity via the standard Dirac action and find that these further\ncorrect the torsion tensor. Such a correction leads to two new results: (i) a\ngeneric enhancement of CS modified gravity by the Dirac equation and axial\nfermion currents; (ii) a new two-fermion interactions, mediated by an axial\ncurrent and the CS correction. We conclude with a discussion of the\nconsequences of these results in particle detectors and realistic astrophysical\nsystems. \n\n"}

In particular, the Poincar\\'{e} symmetry at asymptotic\ninfinity must replaced by a spin-enlarged Poincar\\'{e} symmetry. Likewise, the\ngenerators of the asymptotic symmetry group must be supplemented to account for\nthe internal spin. In the Hamiltonian framework of first order Einstein-Cartan\ngravity, the extra generator comes from the boundary term of the Gauss\nconstraint in the asymptotically flat context.

Unit invariance is achieved by introducing a gauge\nfield called the scale, designed to measure how unit systems vary from point to\npoint. In fact, by a uniform and simple Weyl invariant coupling of scale and\nmatter fields, we unify massless, massive, and partially massless excitations.\nAs a consequence, masses now dictate the response of physical quantities to\nchanges of scale.

We postulate that events are\nfundamental, and that some events have the potential to receive information\nabout other events, but not vice versa. This leads to the concept of a\npartially-ordered set of events, which is called a causal set. Quantification\nproceeds by selecting two chains of coordinated events, each of which\nrepresents an observer, and assigning a valuation to each chain. Events can be\nprojected onto each chain by identifying the earliest event on the chain that\ncan be informed about the event. In this way, each event can be quantified by a\npair of numbers, referred to a pair, that derives from the valuations on the\nchains. Pairs can be decomposed into a sum of symmetric and antisymmetric\npairs, which correspond to time-like and space-like coordinates. From this\npair, we derive a scalar measure and show that this is the Minkowski metric.\nThe Lorentz transformations follow, as well as the fact that speed is a\nrelevant quantity relating two inertial frames, and that there exists a maximal\nspeed, which is invariant in all inertial frames. All results follow directly\nfrom the Event Postulate and the adopted quantification scheme. \n\n"}

Consistent boundary conditions at both the cutoff surface and\nthe horizon are found and the resulting modes analyzed. For general cutoff\n$r_c$ the dispersion relation is shown at long wavelengths to be that of a\nlinearized Navier-Stokes fluid living on the cutoff surface. A cutoff-dependent\nline-integral formula for the diffusion constant $D(r_c)$ is derived. The\ndependence on $r_c$ is interpreted as renormalization group (RG) flow in the\nfluid. Taking the cutoff to infinity in an asymptotically AdS context, the\nformula for $D(\\infty)$ reproduces as a special case well-known results derived\nusing AdS/CFT. Taking the cutoff to the horizon, the effective speed of sound\ngoes to infinity, the fluid becomes incompressible and the Navier-Stokes\ndispersion relation becomes exact.

Proposing a spacetime\nco-algebra that is similar to the coproduct in the bicrossproduct basis of\nkappa Poincare algebra, we derive the phase space algebra using the Heisenberg\ndouble construction. The phase space variables of the dual kappa Poincare\nalgebra are then related to the SR phase space variables. From these relations,\nwe complete the dual kappa Poincare algebra by deriving the action of rotations\nand boosts on the momenta. \n\n"}

Abstract: The question of what it means for a theory to describe the same physics on\nall spacetimes (SPASs) is discussed. As there may be many answers to this\nquestion, we isolate a necessary condition, the SPASs property, that should be\nsatisfied by any reasonable notion of SPASs. This requires that if two theories\nconform to a common notion of SPASs, with one a subtheory of the other, and are\nisomorphic in some particular spacetime, then they should be isomorphic in all\nglobally hyperbolic spacetimes (of given dimension). The SPASs property is\nformulated in a functorial setting broad enough to describe general physical\ntheories describing processes in spacetime, subject to very minimal\nassumptions. By explicit constructions, the full class of locally covariant\ntheories is shown not to satisfy the SPASs property, establishing that there is\nno notion of SPASs encompassing all such theories. It is also shown that all\nlocally covariant theories obeying the time-slice property possess two local\nsubstructures, one kinematical (obtained directly from the functorial\nstructure) and the other dynamical (obtained from a natural form of dynamics,\ntermed relative Cauchy evolution). The covariance properties of relative Cauchy\nevolution and the kinematic and dynamical substructures are analyzed in detail.\nCalling local covariant theories dynamically local if their kinematical and\ndynamical local substructures coincide, it is shown that the class of\ndynamically local theories fulfills the SPASs property.

The\nproblem is that holonomy corrections modify the gravitational part of the\nHamiltonian of the system leading, after Legendre's transformation, to a non\ncovariant Lagrangian which is in contradiction with one of the main principles\nof General Relativity. A more consistent way to deal with the big rip\nsingularity avoidance is to disregard modification in the gravitational part of\nthe Hamiltonian, and only consider inverse volume effects \\cite{bo02a}. In this\ncase we will see that, not like the big bang singularity, the big rip\nsingularity survives in loop quantum cosmology. Another way to deal with the\nbig rip avoidance is to take into account geometric quantum effects given by\nthe the Wheeler-De Witt equation. In that case, even though the wave packets\nspread, the expectation values satisfy the same equations as their classical\nanalogues.

By carefully\nfollowing general principles and procedures we clarify a number of topological\nissues. First we combine the interpretation of A as a connection on a principal\nU(1)-bundle with the perspective of general covariance to deduce a physical\ngauge equivalence relation, which is intimately related to the Aharonov-Bohm\neffect. By Peierls' method we subsequently find a Poisson bracket on the space\nof local, affine observables of the theory. This Poisson bracket is in general\ndegenerate, leading to a quantum theory with non-local behaviour. We show that\nthis non-local behaviour can be fully explained in terms of Gauss' law. Thus\nour analysis establishes a relationship, via the Poisson bracket, between the\nAharonov-Bohm effect and Gauss' law (a relationship which seems to have gone\nunnoticed so far).

Deviations from isotropy have been found and demonstrated to\nbe robust against component separation algorithm, mask choice and frequency\ndependence. Many of these anomalies were previously observed in the WMAP data,\nand are now confirmed at similar levels of significance (about 3 sigma).\nHowever, we find little evidence for non-Gaussianity, with the exception of a\nfew statistical signatures that seem to be associated with specific anomalies.\nIn particular, we find that the quadrupole-octopole alignment is also connected\nto a low observed variance of the CMB signal. A power asymmetry is now found to\npersist to scales corresponding to about l=600, and can be described in the\nlow-l regime by a phenomenological dipole modulation model. However, any\nprimordial power asymmetry is strongly scale-dependent and does not extend to\narbitrarily small angular scales.

Here, we study generally covariant metric-torsion theories of gravity\npresented more concretely, setting that their Lagrangians are \\emph{manifestly}\ngenerally covariant scalars. It is assumed that Lagrangians depend on metric\ntensor, curvature tensor, torsion tensor and its first and second covariant\nderivatives, besides, on an arbitrary set of other tensor (matter) fields and\ntheir first and second covariant derivatives. Thus, both the standard minimal\ncoupling with the Riemann-Cartan geometry and non-minimal coupling with the\ncurvature and torsion tensors are considered.\n  The studies and results are as follow. (a) A physical interpretation of the\nNoether and Klein identities is examined. It was found that they are the basis\nfor constructing equations of balance of energy-momentum tensors of various\ntypes (canonical, metrical and Belinfante symmetrized). The equations of\nbalance are presented. (b) Using the generalized equations of balance, new\n(generalized) manifestly generally covariant expressions for canonical\nenergy-momentum and spin tensors of the matter fields are constructed. In the\ncases, when the matter Lagrangian contains both the higher derivatives and\nnon-minimal coupling with curvature and torsion, such generalizations are\nnon-trivial.

An appropriate choice of the accelerations\nof the mirrors, provide primitive periodic orbits associated to the prime\nnumbers $p$, whose periods, measured by the observer's clock, are log p. Acting\non the chiral components of the fermion, H becomes the Berry-Keating\nHamiltonian (x p + p x)/2, where x is identified with the Rindler spatial\ncoordinate and p with the conjugate momentum.\n  The delta function potentials give the matching conditions of the fermion\nwave functions on both sides of the mirrors. There is also a phase shift for\nthe reflection of the fermions at the boundary where the observer sits. The\neigenvalue problem is solved by transfer matrix methods in the limit where the\nreflection amplitudes become infinitesimally small.

Related to this is the fact that the propagator for the massive scalar\nfield corresponding to the de Sitter-invariant vacuum state diverges in the\nmassless limit, with the infrared-divergent term being a constant.

A main point is that two different concepts, number and number\nvalue are combined in the usual representations of number structures. This is\nvalid as long as just one structure of each number type is being considered. It\nis not valid when different structures of each number type are being\nconsidered. Elements of base sets of number structures, considered by\nthemselves, have no meaning. They acquire meaning or value as elements of a\nnumber structure. Fiber bundles over a space or space time manifold, M, are\ndescribed. The fiber consists of a collection of many real or complex number\nstructures and vector space structures. The structures are parameterized by a\nreal or complex scaling factor, s. A vector space at a fiber level, s, has, as\nscalars, real or complex number structures at the same level. Connections are\ndescribed that relate scalar and vector space structures at both neighbor M\nlocations and at neighbor scaling levels.

Overall we find that: (i) for binaries with masses\ndiffering no more than $20\\%$, the frequency at gravitational-wave amplitude's\nmaximum is related quasi-universally with the tidal deformability of the two\nstars; (ii) the spectral properties vary during the post-merger phase, with a\ntransient phase lasting a few millisecond after the merger and followed by a\nquasi-stationary phase; (iii) when distinguishing the spectral peaks between\nthese two phases, a number of ambiguities in the identification of the peaks\ndisappear, leaving a simple and robust picture; (iv) using properly identified\nfrequencies, quasi-universal relations are found between the spectral features\nand the properties of the neutron stars; (v) for the most salient peaks\nanalytic fitting functions can be obtained in terms of the stellar tidal\ndeformability or compactness.

It has been argued that this is an\nanalogue for quantum processes in the presence of closed timelike curves\n(CTCs). The unusual properties of states of quantum communication networks that\nfulfill the D-CTC condition have been discussed extensively in recent\nliterature. In this work, the D-CTC condition is investigated in the framework\nof quantum field theory in the local, operator-algebraic approach due to Haag\nand Kastler. It is shown that the D-CTC condition cannot be fulfilled in states\nwhich are analytic for the energy, or satisfy the Reeh-Schlieder property, for\na certain class of processes and initial conditions. On the other hand, if a\nquantum field theory admits sufficiently many uncorrelated states across\nacausally related spacetime regions (as implied by the split property), then\nthe D-CTC condition can always be fulfilled approximately to arbitrary\nprecision. As this result pertains to quantum field theory on globally\nhyperbolic spacetimes where CTCs are absent, one may conclude that interpreting\nthe D-CTC condition as characteristic for quantum processes in the presence of\nCTCs could be misleading, and should be regarded with caution. Furthermore, a\nconstruction of the quantized massless Klein-Gordon field on the Politzer\nspacetime, often viewed as spacetime analogue for quantum communication\nnetworks with backward time-steps, is proposed in this work. \n\n"}

First, the mathematical\ntheory of tensor operators for a Lie group is recast in a new way which is used\nto generalise the Wigner-Eckart theorem to non-compact groups. The result\nrelies on the knowledge of the recoupling theory between finite-dimensional and\ninfinite-dimensional irreducible representations of the group; here the\npreviously unconsidered cases of the 3D and 4D Lorentz groups are investigated\nin detail. As an application, the Wigner-Eckart theorem is used to generalise\nthe Jordan-Schwinger representation of SU(2) to both groups, for all\nrepresentation classes. Next, the results obtained for the 3D Lorentz group are\napplied to (2+1) Lorentzian loop quantum gravity to develop an analogue of the\nwell-known spinorial approach used in the Euclidean case. Tensor operators are\nused to construct observables and to generalise the Hamiltonian constraint\nintroduced by Bonzom and Livine (2012) for 3D gravity to the Lorentzian case.\nThe Ponzano-Regge amplitude is shown to be a solution of this constraint by\nrecovering the (opportunely generalised) Biedenharn-Elliott relations.

In this paper we explore the mechanical coupling between\nthe core r-modes and the elastic crust, using a toy model of a constant density\nneutron star with a constant shear modulus crust. We find that, at spin\nfrequencies in excess of ~50 Hz, the r-modes strongly penetrate the crust.

It is\nknown that this entropy satisfies the area law -- entropy proportional to the\narea of the sphere -- when the field is assumed to be in its ground state. We\nshow that the area law continues to hold when the scalar field degrees of\nfreedom are in generic coherent states and a class of squeezed states. However,\nwhen excited states are considered, the entropy scales as a lower power of the\narea. This suggests that for large horizons, the ground state entropy\ndominates, whereas entropy due to excited states gives power law corrections.\nWe discuss possible implications of this result to black hole entropy. \n\n"}
