T*'s and E*'s merge together with the Tc\ncurve and 3.5kBTc curve at pu - 1.1 in the overdoped regime, respectively. They\nfinally go to zero at pu - 1.3. The UEPD follows an asymmetric half-dome-shaped\nTc curve in which Tc appears at pu - 0.4, reaches a maximum at pu - 1, and\nrapidly goes to zero at pu - 1.3. The asymmetric half-dome-shaped Tc curve is\nat odds with the well-known symmetric superconducting dome for La2-xSrxCuO4\n(SrD-La214), in which two characteristic temperatures and energies converge as\npu increases and merge together at pu - 1.6, where Tc goes to zero.

To check the validity of this claim, we study\nd-wave superconductivity on the checkerboard Hubbard model on a square lattice\nusing the Cellular Dynamical Mean Field theory method with an exact\ndiagonalization solver at zero temperature. The d-wave order parameter is\ncomputed for various inhomogeneity levels over the entire doping range of\ninterest in both strong and weak coupling regimes. At a given doping, the size\nof the d-wave order parameter manifests itself directly in the height of the\ncoherence peaks and hence is an appropriate measure of the strength of\nsuperconductivity. The weak coupling results reveal a suppression of the order\nparameter in the presence of inhomogeneity for small to intermediate hole\ndopings, while it is enhanced for large dopings. In contrast, for strong\ncoupling there is a monotonic decrease in the maximum amplitude of the\nsuperconducting order parameter with inhomogeneity over the entire doping range\nof interest. Furthermore, at moderately high inhomogeneity, the system\nundergoes a first-order transition from the superconducting to the normal state\nin the underdoped regime. In the overdoped regime, the change in the value of\nthe superconducting order parameter correlates with the height of the lowest\nenergy peak in the spectral weight of antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations,\nconfirming the connection between antiferromagnetic fluctuations and d-wave\nsuperconductivity found in earlier studies on the homogeneous case.

Despite this long history the\nunambiguous observation of Majorana fermions nevertheless remains an\noutstanding goal.

We begin by introducing in some detail\nexotic `topological' one- and two-dimensional superconductors that support\nMajorana fermions at their boundaries and at vortices.

Consequently, by supplementing the Hamiltonian of\nthe SU(N) model with a perturbation Hamiltonian that removes the GS degeneracy,\nthe LT is to apply also for the SU(N) model in the limit of the coupling\nconstant, \\lambda, of this perturbation approaching zero, where the limit\n\\lambda --> 0 is clearly to be taken subsequent to taking the zero-temperature\nlimit of the thermal single-particle Green function in the expression for the\nLuttinger number N_L. We explicitly establish the validity of this statement\nfor the case of N=4. The details of the relevant calculations being distinctly\ntransparent, one can readily convince oneself that our observation is valid for\narbitrary N. It follows that the issues raised by DPK, such as non-existence of\nthe Luttinger-Ward functional and \"breakdown of the elemental particle picture\nin strongly correlated electron matter\", are all inessential to the observed\nfailure of the LT.

When the DQD is unbiased, we find $T_2 \\simeq 2 T_1$\nand much longer lifetimes than in the biased DQD.

For a finite chain with open boundaries the time derivatives of\nquasilocal operators are not strictly vanishing but result in operators\nlocalized near the boundaries of the chain. We show that a simple modification\nof the non-Hermitian transfer operator results in exactly conserved, but still\nquasilocal operators for periodic or generally twisted boundary conditions.

These two effects have different physical origins, yet they can lead to\nsimilar gap features in the electronic spectrum. Here we show how to\ndisentangle them experimentally in the iron superconductors with one Fe plane\nper unit cell. Although the splitting of the low energy doublet at the\nBrillouin zone center ($\\Gamma$-point) can be due to either the spin-orbit\ncoupling or the nematic order, or both, the degeneracy of each of the doublet\nstates at the zone corner ($M$-point) is protected by the space group symmetry\neven when spin-orbit coupling is taken into account. Therefore, any splitting\nat $M$ must be due to lowering of the crystal symmetry, such as due to the\nnematic order. We further analyze a microscopic tight-binding model with two\ndifferent contributions to the nematic order: $d_{xz}/d_{yz}$ onsite energy\nanisotropy and the $d_{xy}$ hopping anisotropy.

At finite temperatures, however, the additional effects of\nthermal fluctuations in the restricted phase space of a low-dimensional system\nhave received much less attention, particularly the situation in frustrated\nquantum magnets, where the excitations may be complex collective (bound or even\nfractionalized) modes. We investigate this problem by studying the\nthermodynamic properties of the frustrated two-leg S=1/2 spin ladder, with\nparticular emphasis on the fully frustrated case. We present numerical results\nfor the magnetic specific heat and susceptibility, obtained from exact\ndiagonalization and quantum Monte Carlo studies, which we show can be rendered\nfree of the sign problem even in a strongly frustrated system and which allow\nus to reach unprecedented sizes of L=200 ladder rungs. We find that frustration\neffects cause an unconventional evolution of the thermodynamic response across\nthe full parameter regime of the model. However, close to the first-order\ntransition they cause a highly anomalous reduction in temperature scales with\nno concomitant changes in the gap; the specific heat shows a very narrow peak\nat very low energies and the susceptibility rises abruptly at extremely low\ntemperatures. Unusually, the two quantities have different gaps over an\nextended region of the parameter space.

In the\nabsence of translational symmetry breaking or topological order, these\nconventional order parameters cannot explain the gap in the charged fermion\nexcitation spectrum in the anti-nodal region. Zhao et al. (1601.01688) and\nJeong et al.

In\nthis work, we study the properties of the amplitude (Higgs) modes in a\nunidirectional PDW state. To this end we consider a phenomenological model of\nPDW type states coupled to a Fermi surface of fermionic quasiparticles. In\ncontrast to conventional superconductors that have a single Higgs mode,\nunidirectional PDW superconductors have two Higgs modes. While in the PDW state\nthe Fermi surface largely remains gapless, we find that the damping of the PDW\nHiggs modes into fermionic quasiparticles requires exceeding an energy\nthreshold.

The result of\nan FCI calculation is a weighted set of electronic configurations, which can\nalso be expressed in terms of excitations from a reference configuration. The\nexcitation amplitudes contain information on the complexity of the electronic\nwave function, but this information is contaminated by contributions from\ndisconnected excitations, i.e. those excitations that are just products of\nindependent lower-level excitations. The unwanted contributions can be removed\nvia a cluster decomposition procedure, making it possible to examine the\nimportance of connected excitations in complicated multireference molecules\nwhich are outside the reach of conventional algorithms. We present an\nimplementation of the cluster decomposition analysis and apply it to both true\nFCI wave functions, as well as wave functions generated from the adaptive\nsampling CI (ASCI) algorithm.

This is an important aspect for the low-energy realizations of the\nMajorana mass terms exploiting superfluid pairings, because in this case the\nMajorana condition is not implemented in the spinor space, but in an internal\n(flavour) space. Moreover, these mass terms generally involve opposite\neffective chiralities, similarly to a Dirac mass term. The net effect of these\nfeatures is that the Majorana condition does not imply a Majorana mass term.\nAccordingly the obtained Majorana spinors, as well as the resulting symmetry\nbreaking pattern and low-energy spectrum, are qualitatively different from the\nones known in particle physics. This result has important phenomenological\nconsequences, e.g. implies that these mass terms are unsuitable to induce an\neffective see-saw mechanism, proposed to give mass to neutrinos.

The peak-dip-hump structure has been commonly interpreted as the\nresult of the coupling of the electron to some Bosonic mode. However, such an\nelectron-Boson coupling picture does not answer the question of \\textit{why the\nquasiparticle dispersion is so flat in the anti-nodal region}, a behavior\ntotally unexpected for Bogoliubov quasiparticle in a d-wave BCS superconductor.\nHere we show that the sharp quasiparticle peak in the anti-nodal region should\nbe understood as a new pole in the electron Green's function generated by the\nstrong coupling of the electron to diffusive spin fluctuation around the\nantiferromagnetic wave vector $\\mathbf{Q}=(\\pi,\\pi)$, rather than a nearly free\nBogoliubov quasiparticle in a d-wave BCS superconductor.

Nevertheless the model exhibits topological responses\nincluding the appearance of quantized fractional charge bound to rotational\ndefects (disclinations) and the pumping of angular momentum in response to\nthreading an elementary magnetic flux, which are described by a mutual\nChern-Simons coupling between the electromagnetic gauge field and an effective\ngauge field corresponding to the rotation symmetry. In addition, we show that\nalthough the filled bands of the model do not admit a symmetric Wannier\nrepresentation, this obstruction is removed upon the addition of appropriate\natomic orbitals, which implies `fragile' topology. As a result, the response of\nthe model can be derived by representing it as a superposition of atomic\norbitals with positive and negative integer coefficients. Following the\nanalysis of the model, which serves as a prototypical example of 2D TCIs\nprotected by rotation, we show that all TCIs protected by point group\nsymmetries which do not have protected surface states are either atomic\ninsulators or fragile phases.
