Using precise measurements from XMM-Newton data of a sample of 10\nrelaxed nearby clusters, spanning a Y_ X range of 10^13 -10^15 M_sun keV, we\ninvestigate the M_500-Y_ X relation.

We have performed a cluster analysis of the local\nextrema in the CMB signal to show that the CS is actually associated with a\nlarge group of extrema rather than just one. In the light of this we have\nre-examined the properties of the WMAP ILC and co-added \"cleaned\" WCM maps,\nwhich have previously been used for the analysis of the properties of the\nsignal in the vicinity of the CS. These two maps have remarkably similar\nproperties on equal latitude rings for |b|>30deg, as well as in the vicinity of\nthe CS. We have also checked the idea that the CMB signal has a non-Gaussian\ntail, localized in the low multipole components of the signal. For each ring we\napply a linear filter with characteristic scale R, dividing the CMB signal in\ntwo parts: the filtered part, with characteristic scale above that of the\nfilter R, and the difference between the initial and filtered signal. Using the\nfilter scale as a variable, we can maximize the skewness and kurtosis of the\nsmoothed signal and minimize these statistics for the difference between\ninitial and filtered signal. We have discovered that the shape of the CS is\nformed primarily by the components of the CMB signal represented by multipoles\nbetween 10<=L<=20, with a corresponding angular scale about 5-10 degs. This\nsignal leads to modulation of the whole CMB sky, clearly seen at |b|>30deg in\nboth the ILC and WCM maps, rather than a single localized feature. After\nsubtraction of this modulation, the remaining part of the CMB signal appears to\nbe consistent with statistical homogeneity and Gaussianity. \n\n"}

The\ncluster is the hottest (>10 keV), most X-ray luminous system at z>0.6 known to\ndate. The relaxed X-ray morphology, as well as its high temperature, is unusual\nat such a high redshift. Our mass reconstruction shows that on a large scale\nthe dark matter distribution is consistent with a relaxed system with no\nsignificant substructures.

Entropy is therefore a useful\nquantity for studying the effects of feedback on the cluster environment and\ninvestigating any breakdown of cluster self-similarity. We find that most ICM\nentropy profiles are well-fit by a model which is a power-law at large radii\nand approaches a constant value at small radii: K(r) = K0 + K100(r/100 kpc),\nwhere K0 quantifies the typical excess of core entropy above the best fitting\npower-law found at larger radii.

Abstract: Abr: We investigate whether the Hubble sequence can be reproduced by the\nrelics of merger events.

Their\nmorphologies are dominated by young stars and are related to their ionised-gas\nkinematics. We show that both morphologies and kinematics can be reproduced by\nusing gas modelling from Barnes' (2002) study of major mergers.

All\ndistant and massive starbursts can be distributed along a temporal sequence\nfrom the first passage to the nuclei fusion and then to the disk rebuilding\nphase.

Particularly worrisome in this respect is\nintrinsic alignment, causing considerable parameter biases via correlations\nbetween the intrinsic ellipticities of galaxies and the gravitational shear,\nwhich mimic lensing. In an earlier work we have proposed a nulling technique\nthat downweights this systematic, only making use of its well-known redshift\ndependence. We assess the practicability of nulling, given realistic conditions\non photometric redshift information. For several simplified intrinsic alignment\nmodels and a wide range of photometric redshift characteristics we calculate an\naverage bias before and after nulling. Modifications of the technique are\nintroduced to optimize the bias removal and minimize the information loss by\nnulling.

Composite cluster samples are combined by scaling the counting\nradius by r200 to minimize radius selection bias. The separation of galaxies\ninto a red and blue population was achieved by selecting galaxies relative to\nthe cluster color-magnitude relation. The DGR of the red and blue galaxies is\nfound to be independent of cluster richness (Bgc), although the DGR is larger\nfor the blue population at all measured radii. A decrease in the DGR for the\nred and red+blue galaxies is detected in the cluster core region, while the\nblue galaxy DGR is nearly independent of radius.

We find M_1/2 = 3 \\sigma_los^2 r_1/2 / G ~ 4\n\\sigma_los^2 R_eff / G, where \\sigma_los^2 is the luminosity-weighted square of\nthe line-of-sight velocity dispersion and R_eff is the 2D projected half-light\nradius.

The data set\nconsists of 238 clusters drawn from the ROSAT All-Sky Survey with 0.1-2.4 keV\nluminosities >2.5e44 erg/second, and incorporates extensive follow-up\nobservations using the Chandra X-ray Observatory.

Our constraints on the luminosity-mass and temperature-mass\nrelations, measured within r_500, lead to three important results. First, the\ndata support the conclusion that excess heating of the intracluster medium has\naltered its thermodynamic state from that expected in a simple, gravitationally\ndominated system; however, this excess heating is primarily limited to the\ncentral regions of clusters (r<0.15r_500).

Abstract: Cosmological simulations of galaxy formation often rely on prescriptions for\nstar formation and feedback that depend on halo properties such as halo mass,\ncentral over-density, and virial temperature. In this paper we address the\nconvergence of individual halo properties, based on their number of particles\nN, focusing in particular on the mass of halos near the resolution limit of a\nsimulation. While it has been established that the halo mass function is\nsampled on average down to N~30 particles, we show that individual halo\nproperties exhibit significant scatter, and some systematic biases, as one\napproaches the resolution limit. We carry out a series of cosmological\nsimulations using the Gadget2 and Enzo codes with N_p=64^3 to N_p=1024^3 total\nparticles, keeping the same large-scale structure in the simulation box. We\nconsider boxes from l_{box} = 8 Mpc/h to l_{box} = 512 Mpc/h to probe different\nhalo masses and formation redshifts. We cross-identify dark matter halos in\nboxes at different resolutions and measure the scatter in their properties. The\nuncertainty in the mass of single halos depends on the number of particles\n(scaling approximately as N^{-1/3}), but the rarer the density peak, the more\nrobust its identification. The virial radius of halos is very stable and can be\nmeasured without bias for halos with N>30. In contrast, the average density\nwithin a sphere containing 25% of the total halo mass is severely\nunderestimated (by more than a factor 2) and the halo spin is moderately\noverestimated for N<100. If sub-grid physics is implemented upon a cosmological\nsimulation, we recommend that rare halos (~3sigma peaks) be resolved with N>100\nparticles and common halos (~1sigma peaks) with N>400 particles to avoid\nexcessive numerical noise and possible systematic biases in the results. \n\n"}

Seemingly\nunrelated observations have discovered that there is a lopsided stellar disk of\nunknown origin orbiting the BH in M31, and possibly many other systems. We show\nthat these nominally independent puzzles are in fact closely related.\nMulti-scale simulations of gas inflow from galactic to BH scales show that when\nsufficient gas is driven towards a BH, gravitational instabilities form a\nlopsided, eccentric disk that propagates inwards from larger radii. The\nlopsided stellar disk exerts a strong torque on the remaining gas, driving\ninflows that fuel the growth of the BH and produce quasar-level luminosities.\nThe same disk can produce significant obscuration along many sightlines and\nthus may be the putative 'torus' invoked to explain obscured active galactic\nnuclei and the cosmic X-ray background.

Combining our new measurements with\ndata from the literature, we assemble a sample of 24 active galaxies with\nstellar velocity dispersions and reverberation-based MBH measurements in the\nrange of black hole mass 10^6<MBH/M_sun<10^9. We use this sample to obtain\nreverberation mapping constraints on the slope and intrinsic scatter of the\nM-sigma relation of active galaxies. Assuming a constant virial coefficient f\nfor the reverberation mapping black hole masses, we find a slope b=3.55+-0.60\nand the intrinsic scatter sigma_int=0.43+-0.08 dex in the relation log\n(MBH/M_sun) = a + b log (sigma/200 km/s), which are consistent with those found\nfor quiescent galaxies. We derive an updated value of the virial coefficient f\nby finding the value which places the reverberation masses in best agreement\nwith the M-sigma relation of quiescent galaxies; using the quiescent M-sigma\nrelation determined by Gultekin et al. we find log f=0.72^{+0.09-0.10} with an\nintrinsic scatter of 0.44+-0.07 dex. The uncertainty of the virial coefficient\nremains one of the main sources of the uncertainty in black hole mass\ndeterminations using reverberation mapping, and therefore also in single-epoch\nspectroscopic estimates of MBH in active galaxies. \n\n"}

Many of these studies were based on GALEX imaging of SDSS galaxies\n(z~0.1), and were thus limited by its 5\" FWHM. Poor UV resolution left other\npossibilities for UV excess open, such as the old populations or an AGN. Here\nwe study high-resolution far-ultraviolet HST/ACS images of optically quiescent\nearly-type galaxies with strong UV excess. The new images show that\nthree-quarters of these moderately massive (~5x10^10 M_sun) early-type galaxies\nshows clear evidence of extended SF, usually in form of wide or concentric UV\nrings, and in some cases, striking spiral arms. SDSS spectra probably miss\nthese features due to small fiber size. UV-excess early-type galaxies have on\naverage less dust and larger UV sizes (D>40 kpc) than other green-valley\ngalaxies, which argues for an external origin for the gas that is driving the\nSF. Thus, most of these galaxies appear `rejuvenated' (e.g., through minor\ngas-rich mergers or IGM accretion).

We solve the Langevin equation for a inflaton field with Dirac Born\nInfeld (DBI) kinetic term perturbatively in the noise and use the result to\ndetermine the field value's Probability Density Function (PDF). In this\ncalculation, both the shape of the potential and the warp factor are arbitrary\nfunctions, and the PDF is obtained with and without volume effects due to the\nfinite size of the averaging domain. DBI kinetic terms typically arise in\nstring-inspired inflationary scenarios in which the scalar field is associated\nwith some distance within the (compact) extra dimensions.

We have also obtained complementary IRAM 30m observations of HNCO\nand methanol (CH3OH) lines. SiO is detected in a disk of 400pc size around the\nAGN. SiO abundances in the CND of (1-5)xE-09 are about 1-2 orders of magnitude\nabove those measured in the starburst ring. The overall abundance of CN in the\nCND is high: (0.2-1)xE-07. The abundances of SiO and CN are enhanced at the\nextreme velocities of gas associated with non-circular motions close to the AGN\n(r<70pc). Abundances measured for CN and SiO, and the correlation of CN/CO and\nSiO/CO ratios with hard X-ray irradiation, suggest that the CND of NGC1068 has\nbecome a giant X-ray dominated region (XDR). The extreme properties of\nmolecular gas in the circum-nuclear molecular disk of NGC1068 result from the\ninterplay between different processes directly linked to nuclear activity.\nWhereas XDR chemistry offers a simple explanation for CN and SiO in NGC1068,\nthe relevance of shocks deserves further scrutiny.

The excellent spatial resolution of\nthe thermodynamic maps reveals the dramatic and complex temperature, pressure,\nentropy and metallicity structure of the system.

Although this model (the DLH model) contains scalar field\nmatter, it is reminiscent of the Taub-NUT vacuum solution in that it has\nbiaxial Bianchi IX geometry and its evolution exhibits a dimensionality\nreduction at a quasi-regular singularity that one can identify with the\nbig-bang. We show that the DLH and Taub-NUT metrics are related by a coordinate\ntransformation, in which the DLH time coordinate plays the role of conformal\ntime for Taub-NUT. Since both models continue through the big-bang, the\ncoordinate transformation can become multivalued. In particular, in mapping\nfrom DLH to Taub-NUT, the Taub-NUT time can take only positive values. We\npresent explicit maps between the DLH and Taub-NUT models, with and without a\nscalar field. In the vacuum DLH model, we find a periodic solution expressible\nin terms of elliptic integrals. Mapping the vacuum solution over to Taub-NUT\ncoordinates, recovers the standard (non-periodic) Taub-NUT solution in the Taub\nregion, where Taub-NUT time takes positive values, but does not exhibit the two\nNUT regions known in the standard Taub-NUT solution. Conversely, mapping the\ncomplete Taub-NUT solution to the DLH case reveals that the NUT regions\ncorrespond to imaginary time and space in DLH coordinates. We show that many of\nthe well-known `pathologies' of the Taub-NUT solution arise because the\ntraditional coordinates are connected by a multivalued transformation to the\nphysically more meaningful DLH coordinates.

However, observational evidence for the\nexistence of such outer cool disks in these nuclei is rather poor. Instead,\nrecent observations sometimes suggest the existence of inner cool disks of\nnon-standard type, which develop in the region very close to their central\nblack holes. Taking NGC 4261 as a typical example of such light eating nuclei,\nfor which both flux data ranging from radio to X-ray and data for the\ncounterjet occultation are available, we examine the plausibility of such a\npicture for the accretion states as mentioned above, based on model\npredictions. It is shown that the explanation of the gap seen in the counterjet\nemission in terms of the free-free absorption by an outer standard disk is\nunrealistic, and moreover, the existence itself of such an outer standard disk\nseems very implausible. Instead, the model of RIAF in an ordered magnetic field\n(so called resistive RIAF model) can well serve to explain the emission gap in\nterms of the synchrotron absorption, as well as to reproduce the observed\nfeatures of the overall spectral energy distribution (SED). This model also\npredicts that the RIAF state starts directly from an interstellar hot gas phase\nat around the Bondi radius and terminates at the inner edge whose radius is\nabout 100 times the Schwartzschild radii. Therefore, there is a good\npossibility for a cool disk to develop within this innermost region. \n\n"}

A new technique to extract point sources from\n  CMB maps Abstract: In experimental microwave maps, point-sources can strongly affect the\nestimation of the power-spectrum and/or the test of Gaussianity of the Cosmic\nMicrowave Background (CMB) component. As a consequence, their removal from the\nsky maps represents a critical step in the analysis of the CMB data. Before\nremoving a source, however, it is necessary to detect it and source extraction\nconsists of a delicate preliminary operation. In the literature, various\ntechniques have been presented to detect point-sources in the sky maps. The\nmost sophisticated ones exploit the multi-frequency nature of the observations\nthat is typical of the CMB experiments. These techniques have \"optimal\"\ntheoretical properties and, at least in principle, are capable of remarkable\nperformances. Actually, they are rather difficult to use and this deteriorates\nthe quality of the obtainable results. In this paper, we present a new\ntechnique, the \"weighted matched filter\" (WMF), that is quite simple to use and\nhence more robust in practical applications. Such technique shows particular\nefficiency in the detection of sources whose spectra have a slope different\nfrom zero. We apply this method to three Southern Hemisphere sky regions - each\nwith an area of 400 square degrees - of the seven years Wilkinson Microwave\nAnisotropy Probe (WMAP) maps and compare the resulting sources with those of\nthe two seven-year WMAP point-sources catalogues. In these selected regions we\nfind seven additional sources not previously listed in WMAP catalogues and\ndiscuss their most likely identification and spectral properties. \n\n"}

We investigate the total MF and find it evolves\nnoticeably with redshift. The shape at M*>10^11 M' does not evolve, but below\nM*~10^10.8 M' the MF at high redshift is flat, while in the Local Universe it\nflattens out at lower masses. The population of M* = 10^10.2 - 10^10.8 M'\ngalaxies must have grown significantly between z=0.8 and z=0. We analyze the MF\nof different morphological types (ellipticals, S0s and late-types), and find\nthat also each of them evolves with redshift. All types have proportionally\nmore massive galaxies at high- than at low-z, and the strongest evolution\noccurs among S0 galaxies. Examining the morphology-mass relation (the way the\nproportion of galaxies of different morphological types changes with galaxy\nmass), we find it strongly depends on redshift. At both redshifts, ~40% of the\nstellar mass is in elliptical galaxies. Another ~43% of the mass is in S0\ngalaxies in local clusters, while it is in spirals in distant clusters. To\nexplain the observed trends, we discuss the importance of those mechanisms that\ncould shape the MF. We conclude that mass growth due to star formation plays a\ncrucial role in driving the evolution. It has to be accompanied by infall of\ngalaxies onto clusters, and the mass distribution of infalling galaxies might\nbe different from that of cluster galaxies. However, comparing with high-z\nfield samples, we do not find conclusive evidence for such an environmental\nmass segregation.

These oscillations induce time varying CP-odd nuclear moments,\nsuch as electric dipole and Schiff moments. The coupling between internal\natomic fields and these nuclear moments gives rise to time varying shifts to\natomic energy levels. These effects can be enhanced by using elements with\nlarge Schiff moments such as the light Actinides, and states with large\nspontaneous parity violation, such as molecules in a background electric field.\nThe energy level shift in such a molecule can be ~ 10^-24 eV or larger.

We present the\nresults of a SN survey in the Subaru Deep Field (SDF).

Stochastic\nvariations in the inflow rate move galaxies off the equilibrium M*-Z and\nZ*-fgas relations in a manner correlated with star formation rate, and the\nscatter is set by the timescale to re-equilibrate. The evolution of both\nrelations from z=3-0 is slow, as individual galaxies tend to evolve mostly\nalong the relations. Gas fractions at a given M* slowly decrease with time\nbecause the cosmic inflow rate diminishes faster than the consumption rate,\nwhile metallicities slowly increase as infalling gas becomes more enriched.\nObservations from z~3-0 are better matched by simulations employing\nmomentum-driven wind scalings rather than constant wind speeds, but all models\npredict too low gas fractions at low masses and too high metallicities at high\nM*.

The classical theory is distinguishable from\ngeneral relativity only in the presence of relativistic pressure (or\nvorticity). Since the interior of neutron stars has high pressure and as their\nmass and radius can be measured observationally, they are the perfect\nlaboratory for testing the validity of the aether theory. In this paper, we\nsolve the equations of stellar structure for the gravitational aether theory\nand find the predicted mass-radius relation of non-rotating neutron stars using\ntwo different realistic proposals for the equation of state of nuclear matter.\nWe find that the maximum neutron star mass predicted by the aether theory is\n12% - 16% less than the maximum mass predicted by general relativity assuming\nthese two equations of state. We also show that the effect of aether is similar\nto modifying the equation of state in general relativity. The effective\npressure of the neutron star given by the aether theory at a fiducial density\ndiffers from the values given by the two nuclear equations of state to an\nextent that can be constrained using future gravitational wave observations of\nneutron stars in compact systems.

Our analysis of 61\nSNe with high-quality light curves indicates that the longer the time between\nexplosion and maximum light (i.e., the rise time), the slower the decline of\nthe light curve after maximum. However, SNe with slower post-maximum decline\nrates have a faster rise than would be expected from a single-parameter family\nof light curves, indicating that SN Ia light curves are not a single-parameter\nfamily of varying widths.

After\nnormalising the B-band light curves to Dm15(B)= 1.1 mag (i.e., correcting the\npost-maximum decline to have the same shape as our template), we find that\nspectroscopically normal SNe Ia have a rise time of 18.03 +/- 0.24 d, while HV\nSNe have a faster B-band rise time of 16.63 +/- 0.29 d.

The sample consists of 17 early-type galaxies (ETG) selected\nfrom the SLACS gravitational-lens survey. The galaxies cover the redshift range\nfrom 0.08 to 0.35 and have stellar velocity dispersions between 200 and 350\nkm/s.

In combination with multi-band imaging\ndata, the kinematic data provide stringent constraints on the inner mass\nprofiles of ETGs beyond the local universe.

Regarding $\\beta$ in the CA\nformalism as an adjustable parameter and assuming that the formation of\nisolated clusters corresponds to the case of D_B=0, we determine the mass\nfunction of the isolated clusters by fitting the numerical results from the\nMICE simulations to the modified CA formula.

However, in the event of a merger,\ngravitational-wave (GW) recoil may displace a SMBH from its galactic center, or\neject it entirely. To explore the consequences of this phenomenon, we use\nhydrodynamic simulations of gaseous galaxy mergers that include a range of BH\nrecoil velocities. We have generated a suite of over 200 simulations with more\nthan 60 merger models, enabling us to identify systematic trends in the\nbehavior of recoiling BHs -- specifically (i) their dynamics, (ii) their\nobservable signatures, and (iii) their effects on BH/galaxy co-evolution. (i)\nRecoiling BH trajectories depend heavily on the gas content of the host galaxy;\nmaximal BH displacements from the center may vary by up to an order of\nmagnitude between gas-rich and gas-poor mergers. In some cases, recoil\ntrajectories also depend on the timing of the BH merger relative to the\nformation of the galaxy merger remnant. (ii) Recoiling BHs may be observable as\noffset active galactic nuclei (AGN) via either kinematic offsets (v > 800 km\ns^-1) or spatial offsets (R > 1 kpc) for lifetimes of about 1 - 100 Myr. In\naddition, recoil events affect the total AGN lifetime. GW recoil generally\nreduces the lifetimes of bright AGN, but may extend lower-luminosity AGN\nlifetimes.

We find\na drop in the fraction of massive galaxies with M_{*}>10^{11} Msol which are\ndetected in H alpha emission at z<0.9. We furthermore find that the fraction of\ngalaxies with H alpha emission drops steadily and significantly with redder\n(U-B) colours at z~1, and that the SSFR drops with increasing (U-B) colour for\ngalaxies at all masses. By investigating the SFR-mass relation we find that the\nSFR is roughly constant with mass, in possible contrast to previous work, and\nthat the specific star formation rate (SSFR) is lower in the most massive\ngalaxies. The scatter in the SFR vs. mass relationship is very small for those\nsystems with ongoing star formation which suggests that star formation in the\nmost massive galaxies at z~1 shuts off rather abruptly over <1 Gyr, without an\nobvious gradual decline. We furthermore investigate the SFR as a function of\n(U-B) colour divided into different mass bins, revealing a tracer of the epoch\nof transition from star forming to passive, as a form of star formation\n\"downsizing\".

In\neach scenario, we assign to the free parameters physically motivated priors. We\nfind that while the DM models are weakly preferred to the no modulation model,\nbut when compared to models where the modulation is due to other physics, the\nDM hypothesis is favoured with odds ranging from 185:1 to 560:1.

We use the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to define a volume limited\nsample of massive galaxies complete in both stellar mass (>6e10 Msun) and\nvelocity dispersion (>75 km/s). Using this sample we show that at fixed\nvelocity dispersion there is no dependence of the clustering amplitude on\nstellar or dynamical mass. Conversely when stellar or dynamical mass are fixed\nthere is a clear dependence of the clustering amplitude on velocity dispersion\nwith higher dispersion galaxies showing a higher clustering amplitude. We also\nshow that whilst when stellar or dynamical mass are fixed there remains a\ndependence of clustering amplitude on morphology, there is no such dependency\nwhen dispersion is fixed. However, we do see a dependence of the clustering\namplitude on color when both mass and dispersion are fixed. Despite this, even\nwhen we restrict our samples to only elliptical or red galaxies the\nrelationship between dispersion and clustering amplitude at fixed mass remains.\nIt seems likely that the residual correlation with color is driven by satellite\ngalaxies in massive halos being redder at fixed dispersion. The lack of a\nsimilar morphology dependence implies that the mechanism turning satellites red\nis not changing their morphology. Our central result is that velocity\ndispersion is more closely related to the clustering amplitude of galaxies than\neither stellar or dynamical mass. This implies that velocity dispersion is more\ntightly correlated with the halo properties that determine clustering, either\nhalo mass or age, and supports the notion that the star formation history of a\ngalaxy is more closely related to its halo properties than its overall mass. \n\n"}

We\nfocus on two mechanisms for the formation of BHs at high redshifts: as\nend-products of (1) Population III stars in metal free halos, and of (2)\nrunaway stellar collisions in metal poor NCs. Our model tracks the chemical,\nradiative and mechanical feedback of stars on the baryonic component of the\nevolving halos. This procedure allows us to evaluate when and where the\nconditions for BH formation are met, and to trace the emergence of BH seeds\narising from the dynamical channel, in a cosmological context. BHs start to\nappear already at z~30 as remnants of Population III stars. The efficiency of\nthis mechanism begins decreasing once feedbacks become increasingly important.\nAround redshift z~15, BHs mostly form in the centre of mildly metal enriched\nhalos inside dense NCs. The seed BHs that form along the two pathways have at\nbirth a mass around 100-1000M\\odot. The occupation fraction of BHs is a\nfunction of both halo mass and mass growth rate: at a given z, heavier and\nfaster growing halos have a higher chance to form a native BH, or to acquire an\ninherited BH via merging of another system. With decreasing z, the probability\nof finding a BH shifts toward progressively higher mass halo intervals. This is\ndue to the fact that, at later cosmic times, low mass systems rarely form a\nseed, and already formed BHs are deposited into larger mass systems due to\nhierarchical mergers. Our model predict that at z=0, all halos above\n10^11M\\odot should host a BH (in agreement with observational results), most\nprobably inherited during their lifetime. Halos less massive then 10^9M\\odot\nhave a higher probability to host a native BH, but their occupation fraction\ndecreases below 10%. \n\n"}

Using recent cosmological observations, we constrain the present-day\nenergy density of missing matter to be $\\Omega_{X,0}=-0.034 \\pm 0.075$.

For\ngalaxies within the MS, we show that the variations of specific star formation\nrates (sSFR=SFR/M*) are driven by varying gas fractions. For relatively massive\ngalaxies like those in our samples, we show that the hardness of the radiation\nfield, <U>, which is proportional to the dust mass weighted luminosity\n(LIR/Mdust), and the primary parameter defining the shape of the SED, is\nequivalent to SFE/Z.

The primary goal of\nour study is to investigate the roles of reionization and supernova feedback in\ndetermining the star formation histories of low mass dwarf galaxies. We include\na wide range of physical effects, including metal cooling, molecular hydrogen\nformation and cooling, photoionization and photodissociation from a\nmetagalactic background, a simple prescription for self-shielding, star\nformation, and a simple model for supernova driven energetic feedback.

Measurement of these delay variations is not\nonly crucial for the detection of such signals, but also provides an\nunparallelled measurement of the turbulent interstellar plasma at au scales. In\nthis paper we demonstrate that without consideration of wavelength- independent\nred-noise, 'simple' algorithms to correct for interstellar dispersion can\nattenuate signals of interest to pulsar timing arrays. We present a robust\nmethod for this correction, which we validate through simulations, and apply it\nto observations from the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array. Correction for dispersion\nvariations comes at a cost of increased band-limited white noise. We discuss\nscheduling to minimise this additional noise, and factors, such as\nscintillation, that can exacerbate the problem.

Recently, warm dark matter (WDM) remarkably rose as an\nalternative of cold dark matter (CDM). In the literature, many attempts have\nbeen made to determine the equation-of-state parameter (EoS) of WDM. However,\nin most of the previous works, it is usually assumed that the EoS of dark\nmatter (DM) is constant (and usually the EoS of dark energy is also constant).\nObviously, this assumption is fairly restrictive. It is more natural to assume\na variable EoS for WDM (and dark energy). In the present work, we try to\nconstrain the EoS of variable WDM with the current cosmological observations.\nWe find that the best fits indicate WDM, while CDM is still consistent with the\ncurrent observational data. However, $\\Lambda$CDM is still better than WDM\nmodels from the viewpoint of goodness-of-fit. So, in order to distinguish WDM\nand CDM, the further observations on the small/galactic scale are required. On\nthe other hand, in this work we also consider WDM whose EoS is constant, while\nthe role of dark energy is played by various models.

We find that the mass loss is\nexpected to occur through a steady wind over many tens of free-fall times (t_ff\n~ 10 Myr) rather than by an explosive disruption in one or a few t_ff. Our\nanalysis is based on the finding from simulations that radiation trapping is\nnegligible because it destabilizes the wind (Krumholz & Thompson 2012, 2013).\nEach photon can therefore contribute to the wind momentum only once, so the\nradiative force is limited to L/c. When combining radiation, protostellar and\nmain-sequence winds, and supernovae, we estimate the total direct injection\nrate of momentum into the outflow to be 2.5 L/c. The adiabatic phase of\nsupernovae and main-sequence winds can double this rate. The resulting outflow\nmass-loading factor is of order unity, and if the clumps were to deplete their\ngas the timescale would have been a few disk orbital times, to end with half\nthe original clump mass in stars. However, the clump migration time to the disk\ncenter is on the order of an orbital time, about 250 Myr, so the clumps are\nexpected to complete their migration prior to depletion. Furthermore, the\nclumps are expected to double their mass in a disk orbital time by accretion\nfrom the disk and clump-clump mergers, so their mass actually grows in time and\nwith decreasing radius. From the 6-7 giant clumps with observed outflows, 5 are\nconsistent with these predictions, and one has a much higher mass-loading\nfactor and momentum injection rate. The latter either indicates that the\nestimated outflow is an overestimate (within the 1-sigma error), that the SFR\nhas dropped since the time when the outflow was launched, or that the driving\nmechanism is different, e.g. supernova feedback in a cavity generated by the\nother feedbacks. \n\n"}

Even if\nPIDM contains only a fraction of the net dark matter density, comparable to the\nbaryonic fraction, the subdominant component's interactions can lead to\ninteresting and potentially observable consequences.

More recently, it has been shown that\nthis signal is not confined to the innermost hundreds of parsecs of the Galaxy,\nbut instead extends to at least ~3 kpc from the Galactic Center. While the\nspectrum, intensity, and angular distribution of this signal is in good\nagreement with predictions from annihilating dark matter, it has also been\nsuggested that a population of unresolved millisecond pulsars could be\nresponsible for this excess GeV emission from the Inner Galaxy. In this paper,\nwe consider this later possibility in detail. Comparing the observed spectral\nshape of the Inner Galaxy's GeV excess to the spectrum measured from 37\nmillisecond pulsars by Fermi, we find that these sources exhibit a spectral\nshape that is much too soft at sub-GeV energies to accommodate this signal. We\nalso construct population models to describe the spatial distribution and\nluminosity function of the Milky Way's millisecond pulsars. After taking into\naccount constraints from the observed distribution of Fermi sources (including\nboth sources known to be millisecond pulsars, and unidentified sources which\ncould be pulsars), we find that millisecond pulsars can account for no more\nthan ~10% of the Inner Galaxy's GeV excess.

We\nreport here results from a ~1 yr monitoring with Swift and XMM-Newton, as well\nas from optical spectroscopy.

The UV-to-X-ray spectrum\nof GSN 069 is consistent with a pure accretion disc model which implies an\nEddington ratio of ~0.5 and a black hole mass of ~ 1.2 million solar masses. A\nnew optical spectrum, obtained ~3.5 months after the XMM-Newton slew detection,\nis consistent with earlier spectra and lacks any broad line component,\nclassifying the source as a Seyfert 2 galaxy. The lack of cold X-ray absorption\nand the short timescale variability in the soft X-rays rule out a standard\nSeyfert 2 interpretation of the X-ray data. We discuss our results within the\nframework of two possible scenarios for the broad-line-region (BLR) in AGN,\nnamely the two-phase model (cold BLR clouds in pressure equilibrium with a\nhotter medium), and models in which the BLR is part of an outflow, or\ndisc-wind.

Whilst the low\neccentricity of the system favors a white dwarf companion, an unusual double\nneutron star system is also a possibility, and optical observations will be\nable to distinguish between these possibilities. In order to allow the absolute\nluminosity (or upper limit) of the companion object to be properly calibrated,\nwe undertook astrometric observations with the Very Long Baseline Array to\nconstrain the system distance via a measurement of annual geometric parallax.\nWith these observations, we measure the parallax of the J2222-0137 system to be\n3.742 +0.013 -0.016 milliarcseconds, yielding a distance of 267.3 +1.2 -0.9 pc,\nand measure the transverse velocity to be 57.1 +0.3 -0.2 km/s.

Additionally the baryon feedback impose also\nan equilibrium condition, which when coupled with the imposed baryonic scale\nlength induce a new type of similarity. The new self similar solution implies\nthat the acceleration generated by dark matter is scale free, which in turns\nimplies that the baryonic acceleration at a reference radius is also scale\nfree. Constant dark matter and baryonic accelerations at a reference radius\nhave effectively been observed for a large class of different galaxies, which\nis in support of this approach.

However, this assumption seems invalid in BLR models that\nconsists of an accretion disk and its wind. The disk is likely Keplerian and\ntherefore virialized. However, the wind material must, beyond a certain point,\nbe dominated by an outward force that is stronger than gravity. Here, we\nanalyze hydrodynamic simulations of four different disk winds: an isothermal\nwind, a thermal wind from an X-ray heated disk, and two line-driven winds, one\nwith and the other without X-ray heating and cooling. For each model, we check\nwhether gravity governs the flow properties, by computing and analyzing the\nvolume-integrated quantities that appear in the virial theorem: internal,\nkinetic, and gravitational energies, We find that in the first two models, the\nwinds are non-virialized whereas the two line-driven disk winds are virialized\nup to a relatively large distance.

POLARBEAR-2 is an upgraded experiment\nbased on POLARBEAR-1, which had first light in January 2012. For POLARBEAR-2,\nwe will build a receiver that has 7,588 Transition Edge Sensor (TES) bolometers\ncoupled to two-band (95 and 150 GHz) polarization-sensitive antennas.

An 8-bolometer frequency-domain multiplexing readout has been\ndeployed on POLARBEAR-1 experiment. Extending that architecture to 32\nbolometers requires an increase in the bandwidth of the SQUID electronics to 3\nMHz.

In this range of\nstages, 21+-3% and 28+-5% of the rings are passive according to the FUV and\nH\\alpha\\ indicators, respectively. A ring that is passive according to the FUV\nis always passive according to H\\alpha, but the reverse is not always true.\nRing-lenses form 30-40% of passive rings, which is four times more than the\nfraction of ring-lenses found in active rings in the stage range -3<=T<=2.

We then follow\nprotostar formation in each gas cloud and the subsequent protostellar evolution\nuntil the gas mass accretion onto the protostar is halted by stellar radiative\nfeedback. The accretion rates differ significantly among the primordial gas\nclouds which largely determine the final stellar masses. For low accretion\nrates the growth of a protostar is self-regulated by radiative feedback effects\nand the final mass is limited to several tens of solar masses. At high\naccretion rates the protostar's outer envelope continues to expand and the\neffective surface temperature remains low; such protostars do not exert strong\nradiative feedback and can grow in excess to one hundred solar masses. The\nobtained wide mass range suggests that the first stars play a variety of roles\nin the early universe, by triggering both core-collapse supernovae and\npair-instability supernovae as well as by leaving stellar mass black holes. We\nfind certain correlations between the final stellar mass and the physical\nproperties of the star-forming cloud. These correlations can be used to\nestimate the mass of the first star from the properties of the parent cloud or\nof the host halo, without following the detailed protostellar evolution. \n\n"}

These surveys necessitate the determination of the galaxy\nredshifts using photometric techniques (photo-z). Oftentimes, it is\nadvantageous to remove from the galaxy sample those for which one suspects that\nthe photo-z estimation might be unreliable. In this paper, we show that\napplying these photo-z quality cuts blindly can grossly bias the measured\ngalaxy correlations within and across photometric redshift bins. We then extend\nthe work of Ho et al. (2012) and Ross et al. (2011) to develop a simple and\neffective method to correct for this using the data themselves. Finally, we\napply the method to the Mega-Z catalog, containing about a million luminous red\ngalaxies in the redshift range 0.45 < z < 0.65. After splitting the sample into\nfour \\Delta z = 0.05 photo-z bins using the BPZ algorithm, we see how our\ncorrections bring the measured galaxy auto- and cross-correlations into\nagreement with expectations. We then look for the BAO feature in the four bins,\nwith and without applying the photo-z quality cuts, and find a broad agreement\nbetween the BAO scales extracted in both cases. Intriguingly, we observe a\ncorrelation between galaxy density and photo-z quality even before any photo-z\nquality cuts are applied. This may be due to uncorrected observational effects\nthat result in correlated gradients across the sky of the galaxy density and\nthe galaxy photo-z precision. Our correction procedure could also help to\nmitigate some of these systematic effects. \n\n"}

We find that the best available model of\nthe BAO in real space is the Zel'dovich Approximation (ZA), giving an accuracy\nof <~3% at redshift of z=0 in modelling the matter 2-pt function around the\nacoustic peak. All corrections to the ZA around the BAO scale are perfectly\nperturbative in real space. Any attempt to achieve better precision requires\ncalibrating the theory to simulations because of the need to renormalize those\ncorrections. In contrast, theories which do not fully preserve the ZA as their\nsolution, receive O(1) corrections around the acoustic peak in real space at\nz=0, and are thus of suspicious convergence at low redshift around the BAO. As\nan example, we find that a similar accuracy of 3% for the acoustic peak is\nachieved by Eulerian Standard Perturbation Theory (SPT) at linear order only at\nz~4. Thus even when SPT is perturbative, one needs to include loop corrections\nfor z<~4 in real space. In Fourier space, all models perform similarly, and are\ncontrolled by the overdensity amplitude, thus recovering standard results.\nHowever, that comes at a price. Real space cleanly separates the BAO signal\nfrom non-linear dynamics. In contrast, Fourier space mixes signal from short\nmildly non-linear scales with the linear signal from the BAO to the level that\nnon-linear contributions from short scales dominate.

On the one hand, in the large complex structure regime the\nD7-brane position moduli inherit a shift symmetry from their mirror-dual Type\nIIA Wilson lines. On the other hand, the Type IIB flux superpotential\ngenerically breaks this shift symmetry and allows, by appealing to the large\nflux discretuum, to tune the relevant coefficients to be small. The\nshift-symmetric direction in D7-brane moduli space can then play the role of\nthe inflaton: While the D7-brane circles a certain trajectory on the Calabi-Yau\nmany times, the corresponding F-term energy density grows only very slowly,\nthanks to the above-mentioned tuning of the flux. Thus, the large-field\ninflationary trajectory can be realized in a regime where Kahler, complex\nstructure and other brane moduli are stabilized in a conventional manner, as we\ndemonstrate using the example of the Large Volume Scenario. \n\n"}

We divide the full sample into subsamples of ~20\nclusters based on redshift and central density, performing an X-ray fit to all\nclusters in a subsample simultaneously, assuming self-similarity of the\ntemperature profile. This approach allows us to constrain the shape of the\ntemperature profile over 0<r<1.5R500, which would be impossible on a\nper-cluster basis, since the observations of individual clusters have, on\naverage, 2000 X-ray counts. The results presented here represent the first\nconstraints on the evolution of the average temperature profile from z=0 to\nz=1.2. We find that high-z (0.6<z<1.2) clusters are slightly (~40%) cooler both\nin the inner (r<0.1R500) and outer (r>R500) regions than their low-z\n(0.3<z<0.6) counterparts. Combining the average temperature profile with\nmeasured gas density profiles from our earlier work, we infer the average\npressure and entropy profiles for each subsample. Overall, our observed\npressure profiles agree well with earlier lower-redshift measurements,\nsuggesting minimal redshift evolution in the pressure profile outside of the\ncore. We find no measurable redshift evolution in the entropy profile at\nr<0.7R500. We observe a slight flattening of the entropy profile at r>R500 in\nour high-z subsample. This flattening is consistent with a temperature bias due\nto the enhanced (~3x) rate at which group-mass (~2 keV) halos, which would go\nundetected at our survey depth, are accreting onto the cluster at z~1. This\nwork demonstrates a powerful method for inferring spatially-resolved cluster\nproperties in the case where individual cluster signal-to-noise is low, but the\nnumber of observed clusters is high. \n\n"}

We construct the\nfiducial model so that it reproduces the observationally estimated galaxy\nstellar mass functions and the relationships between the galaxy stellar mass\nand the host halo mass from $z = 4$ to 0. We find that the fiducial model\nconstructed this way naturally explains the cosmic star formation history, the\ngalaxy downsizing, and the star formation rate and metallicity of the\nstar-forming galaxies. The simulations without the quenching of the gas cooling\nin large halos overproduce massive galaxies at $z < 2$ and fail to reproduce\ngalaxy downsizing. The simulations that do not employ the radiation pressure\nfeedback from young stars predict too strong redshift evolution of the\nmass-metallicity relation. Furthermore, the slope of the relation becomes too\nsteep at low redshift without the radiation pressure feedback. The metallicity\ndependence in the radiation pressure feedback is a key to explain the observed\nmass-metallicity relation. These facts indicate that these two processes in\naddition to supernova feedback are essential for galaxy evolution. Our simple\nphenomenological model is suitable to construct a mock galaxy sample to study\nphysical properties of observed galaxy populations. \n\n"}

Planned large galaxy\nsurveys such as the Large Synoptic Sky Telescope (LSST) and Euclid are expected\nto measure the sum of neutrino masses to extremely high precision, sufficient\nto detect non-zero neutrino masses even in the minimal mass normal hierarchy.\nWe show that weak lensing of galaxies while being a very good probe of neutrino\nmasses, is extremely sensitive to baryonic feedback processes.

In this context, we explore two conformal transformations\nof the forms $d\\tau=N(a) dt$ and $d\\tau=N(\\phi) dt$. For the former conformal\ntransformation, we found two cases of $f({\\cal R})$ functions where the field\nequations admit Noether symmetries. In the second case, the Lagrangian reduces\nto a Brans-Dicke-like theory with a general coupling function. For each case,\nit is possible to transform the field equations by using normal coordinates to\nsimplify the dynamical system and to obtain exact solutions. Furthermore, we\nperform quantization and derive the WDW equation for the minisuperspace model.\nThe Lie point symmetries for the WDW equation are determined and used to find\ninvariant solutions. \n\n"}

We\ndescribe here a new method using time-delay lensed quasars where one or several\nimages are affected by microlensing due to stars in the lensing galaxy. Because\nmicrolensing decreases (or increases) the flux of the continuum compared to the\nbroad line region, it changes the contrast between these two emission\ncomponents. We show that this effect can be used to effectively disentangle the\nintrinsic variability of those two regions, offering the opportunity to perform\nreverberation mapping based on single band photometric data. Based on simulated\nlight curves generated using a damped random walk model of quasar variability,\nwe show that measurement of the size of the broad line region can be achieved\nusing this method, provided one spectrum has been obtained independently during\nthe monitoring. This method is complementary to photometric reverberation\nmapping and could also be extended to multi-band data.

An interesting result is that\neven though, as expected, voids in the dark matter field are emptier in $f(R)$\ngravity due to the fifth force expelling away from the void centres, this\nresult is reversed when haloes are used to find voids. The abundance of voids\nin this case becomes even lower in $f(R)$ compared to GR for large voids.\nStill, the differences are significant and this provides a way to tell apart\nthese models. The velocity field differences between $f(R)$ and GR, on the\nother hand, are the same for halo voids and for dark matter voids. Paz et al.\n(2013), concentrate on the velocity profiles around voids. First they show the\nnecessity of four parameters to describe the density profiles around voids\ngiven two distinct void populations, voids-in-voids and voids-in-clouds. This\nprofile is used to predict peculiar velocities around voids, and the\ncombination of the latter with void density profiles allows the construction of\nmodel void-galaxy cross-correlation functions with redshift space distortions.\nWhen these models are tuned to fit the measured correlation functions for voids\nand galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, small voids are found to be of\nthe void-in-cloud type, whereas larger ones are consistent with being\nvoid-in-void. This is a novel result that is obtained directly from redshift\nspace data around voids.

The trigger comprises three stages. A first\nstage employs programmable discriminators to digitize the signals arriving from\nthe camera channels (pixels). At the second stage, a grid of low-cost FPGAs is\nused to process the digitized signals for camera regions with 37 pixels. At the\nthird stage, trigger conditions found independently in any of the overlapping\n37-pixel regions are combined into a global camera trigger by few central\nFPGAs.

Such\nscreened modified gravity models necessarily have dynamics determined by\ncomplex nonlinear equations that usually need to be solved on a model-by-model\nbasis to produce predictions. This makes testing them a cumbersome process. In\nthis paper, we investigate whether there is a common signature for all the\ndifferent models that is suitable to testing them on cluster scales. To do this\nwe propose an observable related to the fifth force, which can be\nobservationally related to the ratio of dynamical-to-lensing mass of a halo,\nand then show that the predictions for this observable can be rescaled to a\nnear universal form for a large class of modified gravity models.

A map of lensing-induced B-modes Abstract: The secondary cosmic microwave background (CMB) $B$-modes stem from the\npost-decoupling distortion of the polarization $E$-modes due to the\ngravitational lensing effect of large-scale structures. These lensing-induced\n$B$-modes constitute both a valuable probe of the dark matter distribution and\nan important contaminant for the extraction of the primary CMB $B$-modes from\ninflation. Planck provides accurate nearly all-sky measurements of both the\npolarization $E$-modes and the integrated mass distribution via the\nreconstruction of the CMB lensing potential. By combining these two data\nproducts, we have produced an all-sky template map of the lensing-induced\n$B$-modes using a real-space algorithm that minimizes the impact of sky masks.\nThe cross-correlation of this template with an observed (primordial and\nsecondary) $B$-mode map can be used to measure the lensing $B$-mode power\nspectrum at multipoles up to $2000$.

We review some\nother less-well-known effects that are not part of standard astrometric models.\nWe model quasars and galaxies using realistic sky distributions, magnitudes and\nredshifts.

Theoretical scenarios including the turbulent small-scale dynamo\npredict magnetic energy densities comparable to the one of turbulence. Based on\nthe assumption of this energy equipartition, we determine the galactic\nsynchrotron flux as a function of redshift z. The conditions in the early\nUniverse are different from the present day, in particular the galaxies have\nmore intense star formation. To cover a large range of conditions we consider\nmodels based on two different systems: one model galaxy comparable to the Milky\nWay and one typical high-z starburst galaxy. We include a model of the steady\nstate cosmic ray spectrum and find that synchrotron emission can be detected up\nto cosmological redshifts with current and future radio telescopes. Turbulent\ndynamo theory is in agreement with the origin of the observed correlation\nbetween the far-infrared (FIR) luminosity L_FIR and the radio luminosity\nL_radio. Our model reproduces this correlation well at z=0. We extrapolate the\nFIR-radio correlation to higher redshift and predict a time evolution with a\nsignificant deviation from its present-day appearance already at z~2 for a gas\ndensity that increases strongly with z. In particular, we predict a decrease of\nthe radio luminosity with redshift which is caused by the increase of cosmic\nray energy losses at high z. The result is an increase of the ratio between\nL_FIR and L_radio. Simultaneously, we predict that the slope of the FIR-radio\ncorrelation becomes shallower with redshift. This behavior of the correlation\ncould be observed in the near future with ultra-deep radio surveys. \n\n"}

Improving our understanding of these mysterious\nplanets requires the detection of a significant sample of objects suitable for\ndetailed characterization. Searching for the transits of the low-mass planets\ndetected by Doppler surveys is a straightforward way to achieve this goal.\nIndeed, Doppler surveys target the most nearby main-sequence stars, they\nregularly detect close-in low-mass planets with significant transit\nprobability, and their radial velocity data constrain strongly the ephemeris of\npossible transits. In this context, we initiated in 2010 an ambitious Spitzer\nmulti-Cycle transit search project that targeted 25 low-mass planets detected\nby radial velocity, focusing mainly on the shortest-period planets detected by\nthe HARPS spectrograph. We report here null results for 19 targets of the\nproject. For 16 planets out of 19, a transiting configuration is strongly\ndisfavored or firmly rejected by our data for most planetary compositions. We\nderive a posterior probability of 83% that none of the probed 19 planets\ntransits (for a prior probability of 22%), which still leaves a significant\nprobability of 17% that at least one of them does transit.

For\ncapturing it, a quantum resolution of the classical background - e.g., in terms\nof a coherent state - is required. In this paper, we first consider a simple\nscalar model with anharmonic oscillations and derive its quantum break-time.\nNext, we apply these ideas to de Sitter space. We formulate a simple model of a\nspin-2 field, which for some time reproduces the de Sitter metric and\nsimultaneously allows for its well-defined representation as quantum coherent\nstate of gravitons. The mean occupation number $N$ of background gravitons\nturns out to be equal to the de Sitter horizon area in Planck units, while\ntheir frequency is given by the de Sitter Hubble parameter. In the\nsemi-classical limit, we show that the model reproduces all the known\nproperties of de Sitter, such as the redshift of probe particles and thermal\nGibbons-Hawking radiation, all in the language of quantum $S$-matrix\nscatterings and decays of coherent state gravitons. Most importantly, this\nframework allows to capture the $1/N$-effects to which the usual semi-classical\ntreatment is blind. They violate the de Sitter symmetry and lead to a finite\nquantum break-time of the de Sitter state equal to the de Sitter radius times\n$N$. We also point out that the quantum-break time is inversely proportional to\nthe number of particle species in the theory. Thus, the quantum break-time\nimposes the following consistency condition: Older and species-richer universes\nmust have smaller cosmological constants. For the maximal, phenomenologically\nacceptable number of species, the observed cosmological constant would saturate\nthis bound if our Universe were $10^{100}$ years old in its entire classical\nhistory. \n\n"}

We develop the formalism in the case of cluster counts\nthat allows the bias of each covariance estimator to be exactly predicted. We\nfind significant effects for a small-scale area or when a low number of\nsubsamples is used, with auto-redshift biases ranging from 0.4% to 15% for\nsubsampling and from 5% to 75% for jackknife covariance estimates. The\ncross-redshift covariance is even more affected; biases range from 8% to 25%\nfor subsampling and from 50% to 90% for jackknife. Owing to the redshift\nevolution of the probe, the covariances cannot be debiased by a simple\nrescaling factor, and an exact debiasing has the same requirements as the full\nSSC prediction. These results thus disfavour the use of internal covariance\nestimators on data itself or a single simulation, leaving analytical prediction\nand simulations suites as possible SSC predictors. \n\n"}

The values of the\nfourth Minkowski functional $V_3$ for the richer BGW superclusters ($V_3 = 7$\nand $10$) show that they have a complicated and rich inner structure.

In the first part of this work we explain how the process\nof structure formation in KFT can be separated into three processes, particle\ndiffusion, the accumulation of structure due to initial momentum correlations\nand interactions relative to the inertial motion of particles. We study these\nprocesses by examining the time derivative of the non-linear density power\nspectrum in the Born approximation. We observe that diffusion and accumulation\nare delicately balanced because of the Gaussian form of the initial conditions,\nand that the net diffusion, resulting from adding these two counteracting\ncontributions, approaches the contributions from the interactions in amplitude\nover time.

The couplings of S are not amenable to investigation in\ncurrent collider data and so are assumed to be Higgs-like to reduce the\nparameter space of the model.

Lightning consists of a fully vectorized inversion\nalgorithm to determine SFH step intensities and combines this with a grid-based\napproach to determine three extinction parameters. We apply our procedure to\nthe extensive FUV-to-FIR photometric data of M51, convolved to a common spatial\nresolution and pixel scale, and make the resulting maps publicly available. We\nrecover, for M51a, a peak star formation rate (SFR) between 0.1 and 5 Gyr ago,\nwith much lower star formation activity over the last 100 Myr. For M51b, we\nfind a declining SFR toward the present day. In the outskirt regions of M51a,\nwhich includes regions between M51a and M51b, we recover a SFR peak between 0.1\nand 1 Gyr ago, which corresponds to the effects of the interaction between M51a\nand M51b. We utilize our results to (1) illustrate how UV+IR hybrid SFR laws\nvary across M51, and (2) provide first-order estimates for how the IR\nluminosity per unit stellar mass varies as a function of the stellar age. From\nthe latter result, we find that IR emission from dust heated by stars is not\nalways associated with young stars, and that the IR emission from M51b is\nprimarily powered by stars older than 5 Gyr. \n\n"}

Today the presence of an annual modulation, which matches in period and\nphase the expectation for dark matter, is supported at > 9$\\sigma$ confidence.\nThe underlying nature of dark matter, however, is still considered an open and\nfundamental question of particle physics.

Abstract: A hypothesis is proposed to explain the long-standing DAMA/LIBRA puzzle.\nIntroduced into the DAMA/LIBRA shielding is a purge gas of nominally\nhigh-purity nitrogen, which under this hypothesis contains argon impurities.\nArgon is introduced into the nitrogen purge gas either through leaks in the\npurge gas plumbing, or through commercially-supplied bottled nitrogen, diffuses\nthrough materials in the detector housings, and then comes in direct contact\nwith the DAMA/LIBRA detectors. These argon impurities can then lead to a\nmodulating 2.8 keV background under two scenarios. Scenario 1): These\nimpurities include the isotope 37Ar, which decays by electron capture, emitting\na 2.8 keV x-ray. These decays appear as single-site, monoenergetic events in\nDAMA/LIBRA, and produce an annual modulation due to the variation of neutron\nflux in the atmosphere and at the Earth's surface, which in turn leads to a\nseasonal variation in 37Ar production from the reactions\n$^{40}\\textrm{Ca}(\\textrm{n,}\\alpha)^{37}\\textrm{Ar}$ and\n$^{36}\\textrm{Ar}(\\textrm{n,}\\gamma)^{37}\\textrm{Ar}$. Scenario 2): Radon is\nalso in the DAMA/LIBRA purge gas, modulating seasonally at a rate below the\ncurrent DAMA/LIBRA limits. When radon or its short-lived daughters decay, the\nresulting beta, gamma, and bremsstrahlung radiation cause stable 40Ar to be\nionized within the copper housings surrounding the NaI(Tl) detectors, resulting\nin characteristic 2.8 keV x-rays. Modulating backgrounds might also result from\nradon-induced neutron or gamma-ray flux from the surrounding cavern, leading to\na small modulating background enhanced at low energy by the presence of 40Ar\nwithin the copper housings. These two scenarios are straightforward to test\nthrough assay of the purge gas as well as Monte Carlo and laboratory study of\nthe DAMA/LIBRA copper housings when excited by ionizing radiation. \n\n"}

With strong, (mostly) double-peaked Lyman Alpha\nprofiles, these galaxies allow us to observe Mg II in the limit of low H I\ncolumn density. We find strong Mg II emission and little-to-no absorption. We\nuse photoionization models to show that nebular Mg II from H II regions is\nnon-negligible, and the ratios of Mg II/[OIII] 5007 vs. [OIII] 5007/[OII] 3727\nform a tight sequence.

In this study, we use two-point auto, cross and mark correlation\nfunctions to investigate the extent to which small-scale clustering properties\nof star forming galaxies can be used to gain physical insight into\ngalaxy-galaxy interactions between galaxies of similar optical brightness and\nstellar mass. The Halpha star formers, drawn from the highly spatially complete\nGalaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey, show an increase in clustering on small\nseparations. Moreover, the clustering strength shows a strong dependence on\noptical brightness and stellar mass, where (1) the clustering amplitude of\noptically brighter galaxies at a given separation is larger than that of\noptically fainter systems, (2) the small scale clustering properties (e.g. the\nstrength, the scale at which the signal relative to the fiducial power law\nplateaus) of star forming galaxies appear to differ as a function of increasing\noptical brightness of galaxies.

The thermal\nSunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) effect, which measures the line-of-sight integral of\nthe plasma pressure, can potentially detect this WHIM, although its expected\nsignal is hidden below the noise. Extragalactic dispersion measures\n(DMs)---obtained through observations of fast radio bursts (FRBs)---are\nexcellent tracers of the WHIM, as they measure the column density of plasma,\nregardless of its temperature. Here we propose cross correlating DMs and tSZ\nmaps as a new way to find and characterize the missing baryons in the WHIM. Our\nmethod relies on the precise ($\\sim$ arcminute) angular localization of FRBs to\nassign each burst a DM and a $y$ parameter. We forecast that the signal from\nthe WHIM should be confidently detected in a cross-correlation analysis of\n$\\sim10^4$ FRBs, expected to be gathered in a year of operation of the upcoming\nCHIME and HIRAX radio arrays, confirming the recent tentative detections of\nfilamentary WHIM. Using this technique, future CMB probes (which might lower\nthe tSZ noise) could determine both the temperature of the WHIM and its\nevolution to within tens of percent.

While radio bubbles inflated by AGN jets\ncould be dynamically supported by cosmic rays (CRs), the impact of CR-dominated\njets are not well understood. In this work, we perform three-dimensional\nsimulations of CR-jet feedback in an isolated cluster atmosphere; we find that\nCR jets impact the multiphase gas differently than jets dominated by kinetic\nenergy. In particular, CR bubbles can more efficiently uplift the cluster gas\nand cause an outward expansion of the hot ICM. Due to adiabatic cooling from\nthe expansion and less efficient heating from CR bubbles by direct mixing, the\nICM is more prone to local thermal instabilities, which will later enhance\nchaotic cold accretion onto the AGN. The amount of cold gas formed during the\nbubble formation and its late-time evolution sensitively depend on whether CR\ntransport processes are included or not.

Abstract: Recently, the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) from the collapse of\nprimordial fluctuations has received much attention. The abundance of PBHs\nformed during radiation domination is sensitive to the tail of the probability\ndistribution of primordial fluctuations. We quantify the level of fine-tuning\ndue to this sensitivity. For example, if the main source of dark matter is PBHs\nwith mass $10^{-12}M_\\odot$, then anthropic reasoning suggests that the dark\nmatter to baryon ratio should range between 1 and 300. For this to happen, the\nroot-mean-square amplitude of the curvature perturbation has to be fine-tuned\nwithin a $7.1\\%$ range. As another example, if the recently detected\ngravitational-wave events are to be explained by PBHs, the corresponding degree\nof fine-tuning is $3.8\\%$.

This generalized (early-late-time) version has\nwider applicability than the standard consistency relation where all modes are\nevaluated at late times. We elucidate the conditions under which the latter\nfollows from the former. A key ingredient is the physical mode condition: that\nthe nonlinear part of the symmetry transformation must match the time\ndependence of the dominant, long wavelength physical mode. This is closely\nrelated to, but distinct from, the adiabatic mode condition. Our derivation\nsheds light on a number of otherwise puzzling features of the standard\nconsistency relation: (1) the underlying nonlinearly-realized symmetries (such\nas dilation and special conformal transformation SCT) originate as residual\ngauge redundancies, yet the consistency relation has physical content---for\ninstance, it can be violated; (2) the standard consistency relation is known to\nfail in ultra-slow-roll inflation, but since dilation and SCT remain good\nsymmetries, there should be a replacement for the standard relation; (3) in\nlarge scale structure applications, it is known that the standard consistency\nrelation breaks down if the long wavelength power spectrum is too blue.

We find that cutting\nout ellipsoidal bubbles from a double-beta pressure profile only matches the\ninner bubble edges in the simulations and fails to account for the emission of\nthe shock-enhanced pressure cocoon outside the bubbles. This additional\ncontribution significantly worsens the accuracy of the cut-out method for jets\nwith small inclinations with respect to the line of sight.

The front is seen\nin the Chandra data as a sharp discontinuity in the gas density which\ndelineates a large body of dense cool gas moving with the near-sonic velocity\nthrough the less dense, hotter gas. Without a magnetic field, the front should\nbe quickly disturbed by the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability arising from\ntangential motion of gas layers. However, Chandra image shows that the front is\nstable within a +-30deg sector in the direction of the cloud motion, beyond\nwhich it gradually disappears. We suggest that the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability\nwithin the +-30deg sector is suppressed by surface tension of the magnetic\nfield whose field lines are parallel to the front. The required field strength\nis B ~ 10 muG. Magnetic field near the front is expected to be stronger and\nhave very different structure compared to the bulk of the intergalactic medium,\nbecause the field lines are stretched by the tangential gas motions. Such a\nmagnetic configuration, once formed, would effectively stop the plasma\ndiffusion and heat conduction across the front, and may inhibit gas mixing\nduring the subcluster merger.

The X-ray temperature is\nfound to be 11.5{+1.1}{-0.9}keV, the highest X-ray temperature of any cluster\nat z>0.6. In contrast to MS1054-0321, the only other very hot cluster currently\nknown at z>0.8, ClJ1226.9+3332 features a relaxed X-ray morphology, and its\nhigh overall gas temperature is not caused by one or several hot spots.

A temperature profile is constructed (for the\nfirst time at this redshift) and is consistent with the cluster being\nisothermal out to 45% of the virial radius. Within the virial radius\n(corresponding to a measured overdensity of a factor of 200), a total mass of\n(1.4+/-0.5)*10^15 M_solar is derived, with a gas mass fraction of 12+/-5%.
