In this\npaper, we compare two different QET protocols for transporting energy with\nelectromagnetic field.

For two types of such systems - namely quantum walks\nand cellular automata - we make this intuition precise by defining an index, a\nquantity that measures the \"net flow of quantum information\" through the\nsystem. The index supplies a complete characterization of two properties of the\ndiscrete dynamics.

We revisit this\nexample here, using it as an entree to three central concepts in quantum\nfoundations: contextuality, Bell-nonlocality, and complementarity.\nSpecifically, we show that Specker's parable offers a narrative thread that\nweaves together a large number of results, including: the impossibility of\nmeasurement-noncontextual and outcome-deterministic ontological models of\nquantum theory (the Kochen-Specker theorem), in particular the proof of\nKlyachko; the impossibility of Bell-local models of quantum theory (Bell's\ntheorem), especially the proofs by Mermin and Hardy; the impossibility of a\npreparation-noncontextual ontological model of quantum theory; and the\nexistence of triples of positive operator valued measures (POVMs) that can be\nmeasured jointly pairwise but not triplewise.

A\nprofound interplay is thus uncovered between the existence and strength of\nquantum correlations and the parallelizability of the spheres S^0, S^1, S^3,\nand S^7 necessitated by the four real division algebras.

A qubit induces an effective coupling between two externally\npumped cavity modes. Without cavity losses and in the dispersive regime,\nintrinsic Josephson oscillations of photons between the two modes occurs. In\nthis case, contrary to regular Markovian decoherence, the qubit purity shows a\nGaussian decay and recurrence of its coherence. Due to intrinsic\nnon-linearities, both the Josephson oscillations as well as the qubit\nproperties display a rich collapse-revival structure, where, however, the\ncomplexity of the qubit evolution is in some sense stronger.

To this end we identify an appropriate\nquantity, which we term $D$, that represents the correlation correction of the\ncondensate order parameter, as it does the self-energy for the Green's\nfunction. An appropriate functional is derived, which is stationary at the\nexact physical realizations of $D$ and of the self-energy. Its derivation is\nbased on a functional-integral representation of the grand potential followed\nby an appropriate sequence of Legendre transformations.

The review discusses similar physics that emerges in\nopen and marginally stable quantum many-body systems.

{"id": "1203.1352", "contents": "Title: Logical Bell Inequalities Abstract: Bell inequalities play a central role in the study of quantum non-locality\nand entanglement, with many applications in quantum information. Despite the\nhuge literature on Bell inequalities, it is not easy to find a clear conceptual\nanswer to what a Bell inequality is, or a clear guiding principle as to how\nthey may be derived. In this paper, we introduce a notion of logical Bell\ninequality which can be used to systematically derive testable inequalities for\na very wide variety of situations. There is a single clear conceptual\nprinciple, based on purely logical consistency conditions, which underlies our\nnotion of logical Bell inequalities. We show that in a precise sense, all Bell\ninequalities can be taken to be of this form. Our approach is very general. It\napplies directly to any family of sets of commuting observables. Thus it covers\nnot only the n-partite scenarios to which Bell inequalities are standardly\napplied, but also Kochen-Specker configurations, and many other examples. There\nis much current work on experimental tests for contextuality. Our approach\ndirectly yields, in a systematic fashion, testable inequalities for a very\ngeneral notion of contextuality.\n  There has been much work on obtaining proofs of Bell's theorem `without\ninequalities' or `without probabilities'. These proofs are seen as being in a\nsense more definitive and logically robust than the inequality-based proofs. On\nthe hand, they lack the fault-tolerant aspect of inequalities. Our approach\nreconciles these aspects, and in fact shows how the logical robustness can be\nconverted into systematic, general derivations of inequalities with provable\nviolations. Moreover, the kind of strong non-locality or contextuality\nexhibited by the GHZ argument or by Kochen-Specker configurations can be shown\nto lead to maximal violations of the corresponding logical Bell inequalities. \n\n"}

On the other hand, the quantum state space calls for a\nnon-local description of multi-particle states. This article uses a\nbehavioristic approach to argue, that an observer in a universe like this has\nto rely on local interactions to learn about its properties and behavior. Such\nan observer is fundamentally restricted in his ability to understand and\nstructurally reconstruct the individual local physical universe. We argue, that\nthis reconstruction based on dynamically available information is the defining\nprocess of observation in quantum theory. The observer-centric view of the\nglobal quantum dynamics is shown to be non-unitary and non-linear in general,\neven if the universe itself evolves unitarily.

This symbolic representation is\nconstructed from self-similar families of quaternionic operators. Using\nnumber-theoretic properties of the cosine function, the statistical properties\nof the symbolic representation of the invariant set are shown to be consistent\nwith the contextual requirements of the Kochen-Specker theorem, are not\nconstrained by Bell inequalities, and mirror the statistics of entangled\nqubits.

In contrast to CSW, we explicitly include the normalization of\nprobabilities, which gives us a much finer control over the various sets of\nprobabilistic models like classical, quantum and generalized probabilistic. In\nparticular, our framework specializes to (quantum) nonlocality in the case of\nBell scenarios, which arise very naturally from a certain product of\ncontextuality scenarios due to Foulis and Randall. In the spirit of CSW, we\nfind close relationships to several graph invariants.

Abstract: Penrose has been advocating the view that the collapse of the wave function\nis rooted in the incompatibility between general relativity and quantum\nmechanics.

To better understand his estimate, in this paper we present\na thought experiment, which singles out the role of time-dilations in massive\nsuperpositions. First we investigate the behavior of a hypothetical clock\ncontaining a component which can be in a superposition of states. The clock\ncontains a massive object, whose only purpose is to introduce a curvature of\nspace time into the problem. We find that a state of this massive object with a\nsmaller radius, but with the same mass, experiences a larger time dilation.\nConsidering a coherent superposition of the large and small object, introduces\nan ambiguity in the definition of a common time for both states. We assert that\nthis time ambiguity can be thought to affect the time evolution of a state in\ndifferent ways and that the relative phase difference between these different\ninterpretations can be calculated. We postulate that the wave function collapse\nwill occur when this phase difference becomes of order unity.

These fluctuations represent the minimal uncertainty that is present\nwhen one probes spacetime geometry with a quantum probe. Two similar models\nhave been proposed, one by Di\\'osi [D-model] and one by Karolyhazy and\ncollaborators [K-model], based on apparently unrelated minimal spacetime\nbounds. The two models arrive at somewhat different expressions for the\ndependence of the localization coherence length on the mass and size of the\nquantum object. In the present article we compare and contrast the two models\nfrom three aspects: (i) comparison of the spacetime bounds, (ii) method of\ncalculating decoherence time, (iii) comparison of noise correlation. We show\nthat under certain conditions the minimal spacetime bounds in the two models\ncan be derived one from the other. We argue that the methods of calculating the\ndecoherence time are equivalent. We re-derive the two-point correlation for the\nfluctuation potential in the K-model, and confirm the earlier result of Di\\'osi\nand Luk\\'acs that it is non-white noise, unlike in the D-model, where the\ncorresponding correlation is white noise in time. This seems to be the origin\nof the different results in the two models. We derive the non-Markovian master\nequation for the K-model.

Their\nimplementation is a key challenge for quantum science and requires the\ndevelopment of stationary quantum nodes that can send and receive as well as\nstore and process quantum information locally. The nodes are connected by\nquantum channels for flying information carriers, i.e. photons. These channels\nserve both to directly exchange quantum information between nodes as well as to\ndistribute entanglement over the whole network. In order to scale such networks\nto many particles and long distances, an efficient interface between the nodes\nand the channels is required. This article describes the cavity-based approach\nto this goal, with an emphasis on experimental systems in which single atoms\nare trapped in and coupled to optical resonators. Besides being conceptually\nappealing, this approach is promising for quantum networks on larger scales, as\nit gives access to long qubit coherence times and high light-matter coupling\nefficiencies.

This is established through the fact that an open system dynamics\ngenerates a Matrix Product state (MPS) which encodes the set of all possible\nquantum jump trajectories and permits the construction of generating functions\nin the spirit of thermodynamic partition functions. In the case of\ncontinuous-time Markovian evolution, such as that generated by a Lindblad\nmaster equation, the corresponding MPS is a so-called continuous MPS which\nencodes the set of continuous measurement records terminated at some fixed\ntotal observation time. Here we show that if one instead terminates\ntrajectories after a fixed total number of quantum jumps, e.g. emission events\ninto the environment, the associated MPS is discrete. This establishes an\ninteresting analogy: The continuous and discrete MPS correspond to different\nensembles of quantum trajectories, one characterised by total time the other by\ntotal number of quantum jumps. Hence they give rise to quantum versions of\ndifferent thermodynamic ensembles, akin to \"grand-canonical\" and \"isobaric\",\nbut for trajectories.

This technique works for particles with and without spin. For\nparticles with spin, on each of the eigenstates that makes up the coherent\nstates, the Berry phase consists of two parts that can be identified as those\ndue to the orbital and the spin motion. It is the orbital Berry phases that\ninterfere coherently to produce a coherent Berry phase corresponding to the\nclassical geometric phase of the gyro-motion. The spin Berry phases of the\neigenstates, on the other hand, remain to be quantum phase factors for the\ncoherent states and have no classical counterpart. \n\n"}

Spins naturally have magnetic dipoles, so\nalternating current (AC) magnetic fields are frequently used to drive spin\ntransitions and perform quantum gates. These fields can be difficult to\nspatially confine to single donor qubits so alternative methods of control such\nas AC electric field driven spin resonance are desirable. However, donor spin\nqubits do not have electric dipole moments so that they can not normally be\ndriven by electric fields. In this work we challenge that notion by\ndemonstrating a new, all-electric-field method for controlling neutral $^{31}$P\nand $^{75}$As donor nuclear spins in silicon through modulation of their\ndonor-bound electrons. This method has major advantages over magnetic field\ncontrol since electric fields are easy to confine at the nanoscale. This leads\nto lower power requirements, higher qubit densities, and faster gate times. We\nalso show that this form of control allows for driving nuclear spin qubits at\neither their resonance frequency or the first subharmonic of that frequency,\nthus reducing device bandwidth requirements.

The proposed methodology is generic, can easily be configured\nfor similar future architectures, and is fully integrated into IBM's SDK.\nExperimental evaluations show that the proposed approach clearly outperforms\nIBM's own mapping solution. In fact, for many quantum circuits, the proposed\napproach determines a mapping to the IBM architecture within minutes, while\nIBM's solution suffers from long runtimes and runs into a timeout of 1 hour in\nseveral cases.

Typically, semiconductor qubit-qubit coupling is\nshort range [1, 2, 4, 5], effectively limiting qubit distance to the spatial\nextent of the wavefunction of the confined particle, which represents a\nsignificant constraint towards scaling to reach dense 1D or 2D arrays of QD\nqubits.

In this paper, we explore the ES of stabilizer codes, which furnish\nexactly solvable models for a plethora of gapped quantum phases of matter.\nStudying the ES for stabilizer Hamiltonians in the presence of arbitrary weak\nlocal perturbations thus allows us to develop a general framework within which\nthe entanglement features of gapped topological phases can be computed and\ncontrasted. In particular, we study models harboring fracton order, both type-I\nand type-II, and compare the resulting ES with that of both conventional\ntopological order and of (strong) subsystem symmetry protected topological\n(SSPT) states. We find that non-local surface stabilizers (NLSS), a set of\nsymmetries of the Hamiltonian which form on the boundary of the entanglement\ncut, act as purveyors of universal non-local features appearing in the\nentanglement spectrum. While in conventional topological orders and fracton\norders, the NLSS retain a form of topological invariance with respect to the\nentanglement cut, subsystem symmetric systems---fracton and SSPT\nphases---additionally show a non-trivial geometric dependence on the\nentanglement cut, corresponding to the subsystem symmetry. This sheds further\nlight on the interplay between geometric and topological effects in fracton\nphases of matter and demonstrates that strong SSPT phases harbour a measure of\nquasi-local entanglement beyond that encountered in conventional SPT phases.

Here we consider qubits\nencoded with constant space overhead (i.e. finite encoding rate) in the limit\nof arbitrarily large code distance $d$ through the use of topological codes\nassociated to triangulations of hyperbolic surfaces. We introduce explicit\nprotocols to demonstrate how Dehn twists of the hyperbolic surface can be\nimplemented on the code through constant depth unitary circuits, without\nincreasing the space overhead. The circuit for a given Dehn twist consists of a\npermutation of physical qubits, followed by a constant depth local unitary\ncircuit, where locality here is defined with respect to a hyperbolic metric\nthat defines the code.

In so doing, we create symbolic\nabelian quantum hidden subgroup algorithms that are analogous to the those\nsymbolic algorithms found within such software packages as Axiom, Cayley,\nMaple, Mathematica, and Magma.\n  As a spin-off of this effort, we create three different generalizations of\nShor's quantum factoring algorithm to free abelian groups of finite rank. We\nrefer to these algorithms as wandering (or vintage Z_Q) Shor algorithms.

This work is concerned by the de\nBroglie-Bohm account of the properties of semiclassical systems. Semiclassical\nsystems are quantum systems that display the manifestation of classical\ntrajectories: the wavefunction and the observable properties of such systems\ndepend on the trajectories of the classical counterpart of the quantum system.\nFor example the quantum properties have a regular or disordered aspect\ndepending on whether the underlying classical system has regular or chaotic\ndynamics. In contrast, Bohmian trajectories in semiclassical systems have\nlittle in common with the trajectories of the classical counterpart, creating a\ndynamical mismatch relative to the quantum-classical correspondence visible in\nthese systems. Our aim is to describe this mismatch (explicit illustrations are\ngiven), explain its origin, and examine some of the consequences on the status\nof Bohmian trajectories in semiclassical systems. We argue in particular that\nsemiclassical systems put stronger constraints on the empirical acceptability\nand plausibility of Bohmian trajectories because the usual arguments given to\ndismiss the mismatch between the classical and the de Broglie-Bohm motions are\nweakened by the occurrence of classical trajectories in the quantum\nwavefunction of such systems. \n\n"}

However, such simple limits\nare not the only limits. I here suggest a new limit which comes from the forms\nand the strengths of the elementary interactions. Namely, there are only four\ntypes of elementary interactions in nature; their forms are determined by the\ngauge invariance (and symmetry breaking), and their coupling constants (in the\nlow-energy regime) have definite values.
