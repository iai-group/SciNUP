We outline the\nevidence that the parent compounds, while metallic, have electron interactions\nthat are sufficiently strong to produce incipient Mott physics. In other words,\nin terms of the strength of electron correlations compared to the kinetic\nenergy, the iron pnictides are closer to intermediately-coupled systems lying\nat the boundary between itinerancy and localization, such as V2O3 or Se-doped\nNiS2, rather than to simple antiferromagnetic metals like Cr.

Using this\nexpansion parameter, we construct the effective low-energy Hamiltonian and\ndiscuss its implications for the magnetic order and magnetic quantum\ncriticality. Finally, this approach sharpens the notion of magnetic frustration\nfor such a metallic system, and brings about a multiband matrix t-J1-J2 model\nfor the carrier-doped iron pnictides. \n\n"}

The d-wave order parameter is\ncomputed for various inhomogeneity levels over the entire doping range of\ninterest in both strong and weak coupling regimes.

The particular chirality of\nthe single-domain configuration is neither favored nor disfavored by the\napplied field. Increasing the field leads to an entry of a domain wall loop or\na vortex into the sample. Formation of a straight domain wall is never\npreferred in equilibrium. Values of the entry (critical) fields for both types\nof defects, as well as the equilibrium size of the domain wall loop, are\ncalculated.

Due to its magnetic origin, long-range nematic order\nenhances magnetic fluctuations, leaving distinctive signatures in the\nspin-lattice relaxation rate, the spin-spin correlation function, and the\nuniform magnetic susceptibility. This enhancement of magnetic excitations is\nalso manifested in the electronic spectral function, where a pseudogap can open\nat the hot spots of the Fermi surface. In the nematic phase, electrons are\nscattered by magnetic fluctuations that are anisotropic in momentum space,\ngiving rise to a non-zero resistivity anisotropy whose sign changes between\nelectron-doped and hole-doped compounds.

For the profiles producing an appreciable signal, these target\nregions vastly overlap with the region corresponding to the so-called \"Fermi\nbubbles\".

Consequently, by supplementing the Hamiltonian of\nthe SU(N) model with a perturbation Hamiltonian that removes the GS degeneracy,\nthe LT is to apply also for the SU(N) model in the limit of the coupling\nconstant, \\lambda, of this perturbation approaching zero, where the limit\n\\lambda --> 0 is clearly to be taken subsequent to taking the zero-temperature\nlimit of the thermal single-particle Green function in the expression for the\nLuttinger number N_L. We explicitly establish the validity of this statement\nfor the case of N=4. The details of the relevant calculations being distinctly\ntransparent, one can readily convince oneself that our observation is valid for\narbitrary N. It follows that the issues raised by DPK, such as non-existence of\nthe Luttinger-Ward functional and \"breakdown of the elemental particle picture\nin strongly correlated electron matter\", are all inessential to the observed\nfailure of the LT. As regards the singularity of the self-energy \\Sigma(\\omega)\non the real \\omega-axis, observed by DPK, we demonstrate that this also is a\ndirect consequence of the non-uniqueness of the GS of the SU(N) model for 0 < n\n< N.

In this view,\nmultiband superconductivity would substantially differ from other systems like\nMgB2, where pairing is predominantly intraband. Indeed, interband-dominated\npairing leads to the coexistence of bonding and antibonding superconducting\nchannels. Here we show that this has profound consequences on the nature of the\nlow-energy superconducting collective modes. In particular, the so-called\nLeggett mode for phase fluctuations is absent in the usual two-band description\nof pnictides. On the other hand, when also the repulsion between the hole bands\nis taken into account, a more general three-band description should be used,\nand a Leggett mode is then allowed.

A central question is whether\ndisorder sets the length scale of the CDW order, for instance by pinning charge\ndensity fluctuations or disrupting an otherwise long range order. Using\nresonant soft x-ray scattering, we investigate the sensitivity of CDW order in\nYBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$ (YBCO) to varying levels of oxygen disorder.

In this state the Cooper pair carries a\nnet momentum and belong to a general class called pair density wave (PDW). The\nmicroscopic pairing mechanism comes from a gauge theory formulation of the\nresonating valence bond (RVB) picture, where electrons traveling in the same\ndirection feel an attractive force in analogy with Ampere's effects in\nelectromagnetism.

For disconnected Fermi pockets, we\npredict that Kohn-Luttinger superconductivity, if it occurs, is likely to be\n$f$-wave. While the Kohn-Luttinger analysis is adequate over most of the doping\nrange, a more sophisticated analysis is needed near Van Hove doping.

In the absence of disorder such\npairing can support both line and point nodes, and both types of nodal\nquasiparticles exhibit nontrivial topology in the momentum space. The point\nnodes, located at the intersections of the closed Fermi surfaces with the\n$c$-axis, act as the double monopoles and the antimonopoles of the Berry\ncurvature, and generalize the notion of Weyl quasiparticles. Consequently, the\n$B$ phase should support an anomalous thermal Hall effect, the polar Kerr\neffect, in addition to the protected Fermi arcs on the (1,0,0) and the (0,1,0)\nsurfaces. The line node at the Fermi surface equator acts as a vortex loop in\nthe momentum space and gives rise to the zero energy, dispersionless Andreev\nbound states on the (0,0,1) surface.

Evidence of CDW formation is found for\n0.45<x<0.93, but not for samples with x<0.44 that exhibit incommensurate\nspin-density-wave order, and in slightly overdoped samples with x=0.99. This\nsuggests the presence of two proximate zero-temperature CDW critical points at\ndoping pc1~0.08 and pc2~0.18. The CDW reflections are observed at\nincommensurate in-plane wave vectors (d_a, 0) and (0, d_b).

I begin to consider the secular changes induced in galactic\nsystems by such presumed variations, assumed adiabatic. It is important to\nunderstand these effects, in isolation from other evolutionary influences, in\norder to identify or constrain a0 variations by detection of induced effects,\nor lack thereof. I find that as long as the system is fully in the deep-MOND\nregime -- as applies to many galactic systems -- the adiabatic response of the\nsystem obeys simple scaling laws. For example, in a system that would be\nstationary for fixed a0, the system expands homologously as a0^{-1/4}, while\ninternal velocities decrease uniformly as a0^{1/4}. If a0 is proportional to cH\nat all relevant times, this change amounts to a factor of ~ 2.5 since redshift\n10. For a system stationary in a rotating frame, the angular frequency\ndecreases as a0^{1/2}. The accelerations increase relative to a0 as a0^{-1/4},\npushing the system towards the Newtonian regime. All this follows from the\nappearance of a0 in MOND and the scale invariance of the deep-MOND limit -- two\nbasic tenets of MOND. More complicated evolution ensues when parts of the\nsystem become Newtonian, or are so from inception. For example, these parts may\nbecome unstable, not being protected by MOND's stabilizing effects. The\nexistence of such regions also modifies the MONDian regime, since they affect\nthe potential everywhere, and since constituents might migrate between the\nNewtonian and MONDian regimes. Studying these last effects would require\ndetailed numerical calculations. \n\n"}

Recent experimental studies on a hole-doped version of BEDT\ncompounds reveal an enhancement of superconductivity and a rapid crossover\nbetween two different conducting phases above the superconducting dome. One of\nthese phases is a Fermi liquid, the other not. Using plaquette cellular\ndynamical mean field theory with state of the art continuous-time quantum Monte\nCarlo calculations, we study this problem with the two-dimensional Hubbard\nmodel on the anisotropic triangular lattice.

In this talk we will present new tests of NRQCD\ninvolving the distribution of quarkonia within jets. The distribution of\nhadrons within jets is determined by nonperturbative functions called\nfragmenting jet functions (FJFs). FJFs are convolutions of fragmentation\nfunctions, evolved to the jet energy scale, with perturbatively calculable\nmatching coefficients. I show how the FJFs for quarkonia can be calculated in\nNRQCD in terms of a few NRQCD long-distance matrix elements (LDME), so the\ndependence of the cross section on the energy fraction of the heavy quarkonium,\nz, is sensitive to the underlying production mechanism, and therefore provides\na new test of NRQCD.

While\nthree-dimensional topological insulators are becoming abundant, two-dimensional\ntopological insulators remain rare, particularly in natural materials. ZrTe5\nhas host a long-standing puzzle on its anomalous transport properties; its\nunderlying origin remains elusive. Lately, ZrTe5 has ignited renewed interest\nbecause it is predicted that single-layer ZrTe5 is a two-dimensional\ntopological insulator and there is possibly a topological phase transition in\nbulk ZrTe5. However, the topological nature of ZrTe5 is under debate as some\nexperiments point to its being a three-dimensional or quasi-two-dimensional\nDirac semimetal. Here we report high-resolution laser-based angle-resolved\nphotoemission measurements on ZrTe5. The electronic property of ZrTe5 is\ndominated by two branches of nearly-linear-dispersion bands at the Brillouin\nzone center. These two bands are separated by an energy gap that decreases with\ndecreasing temperature but persists down to the lowest temperature we measured\n(~2 K). The overall electronic structure exhibits a dramatic temperature\ndependence; it evolves from a p-type semimetal with a hole-like Fermi pocket at\nhigh temperature, to a semiconductor around ~135 K where its resistivity\nexhibits a peak, to an n-type semimetal with an electron-like Fermi pocket at\nlow temperature. These results indicate a clear electronic evidence of the\ntemperature-induced Lifshitz transition in ZrTe5.

SUSY is defined in\nthese new Actions by the fact that they satisfy Master Equations. The new SUSY\nActions are very easy to write down. One simply takes a Chiral SUSY Action,\ncoupled to Gauge and other Chiral Multiplets, and even SuperGravity, if\ndesired. Then one creates a new Action from this by exchanging all or part of\nthe Scalar Field $S$ for a new Zinn Source $J$, and the corresponding part of\nthe Zinn Source $\\Gamma$ for a new Antighost Field $\\eta$. Since the original\nAction satisfies a Master Equation, this exchange guarantees that the new\nAction will satisfy the new Master Equation. As was shown in the earlier paper,\nthe new multiplets have fewer bosonic degrees of freedom than fermionic degrees\nof freedom. This is possible because they do not have a Supercharge.\n  The resulting new SSM has no need for Squarks or Sleptons.

Second, we propose atrous spatial\npyramid pooling (ASPP) to robustly segment objects at multiple scales. ASPP\nprobes an incoming convolutional feature layer with filters at multiple\nsampling rates and effective fields-of-views, thus capturing objects as well as\nimage context at multiple scales.

The CO onset temperature is highest between x = 0.106 and 0.166,\nbut decreases at lower doping levels, indicating that it is not tied to the\nappearance of antiferromagnetic correlations or the pseudogap. Near optimal\ndoping, where the CO wavevector is also consistent with a previously observed\nphonon anomaly, measurements of the CO below and above the superconducting\ntransition temperature, or in a magnetic field, show that the CO is insensitive\nto superconductivity. Overall these findings indicate that, while verified in\nthe electron-doped cuprates, material-dependent details determine whether the\nCO correlations acquire sufficient strength to compete for the ground state of\nthe cuprates. \n\n"}

However, a third hole-like band ($\\gamma$) is not observed, which is\nexpected around the zone center from band calculations and is common in\niron-based superconductors. Since this band has the highest renormalization\nfactor and is known to be the most vulnerable to defects, its absence in our\ndata is likely due to defect scattering --- and yet superconductivity can exist\nwithout coherent quasiparticles in the $\\gamma$ band.

The\ncuprates seems to exhibit statistics, dimensionality and phase transitions in\nnovel ways. The nature of excitations [i.e. quasiparticle or collective] must\nbe understood. The Hubbard model captures some of the behaviour of the phase\ntransitions in these materials. On the other hand the phases such as stripes in\nthese materials bear relationship to quantum group or string-like solutions.\nOne thus expects that the relevant solutions of Hubbard model may thus be\nwritten in terms of stringy solutions. In short this approach may lead to the\nnon-perturbative formualtion of Hubbard and other condensed matter\nHamiltonians. The question arises that how a 1-d based symmetry such as quantum\ngroups can be relevant in describing a 3-d [spatial dimensions] system such as\ncuprates. The answer lies in the key observation that strings which are 1-d\nobjects can be used to describe physics in $d$ dimensions.

By investigating the phase structure of the\nmodel at $T \\neq 0$ we get the following observations; i) Starting from the\nperturbative calculations with the theory renormalized at an arbitrary\nmass-scale $\\mu$ and at an arbitrary temperature $T_0$, we can in principle\nfully resum terms of $O(\\lambda T/\\mu)$ together with terms of $O(\\lambda\n(T/\\mu)^2)$. The key idea is to fix the arbitrary RS-parameters so as to make\nboth of one-loop radiative corrections to the mass as well as to the coupling\nvanish, ensuring the function form of the EP to be determined up to the\nnext-to-leading order of large correction terms, thus absorbing completely\nthose terms of $O(\\lambda (T/\\mu)^2)$ and of $O(\\lambda T/\\mu)$. ii) If we\nstart from the theory renormalized at the temperature of the environment $T$,\nthe $O(\\lambda (T/\\mu)^2)$-term resummation can be simply completed through the\n$T$-renormalization itself.

This class includes the\nHeterotic M-theory brane-world of Refs. \\cite{ovrut,ekpy} and the\nRandall-Sundrum (RS) model as a limiting case. In general, there are two moduli\nfields $y_{\\pm}$, corresponding to the \"positions\" of two branes (which live at\nthe fixed points of an orbifold compactification).

Local terms\nproportional to $K_\\pm^4$, where $K_\\pm=q/y_\\pm$ is the local curvature scale\nat the location of the corresponding brane, are needed in order to remove the\ndivergences in the effective potential. Such terms break the scaling symmetry\nand hence they may act as stabilizers for the moduli. When the branes are very\nclose to each other, the effective potential induced by massless bulk fields\nbehaves like $V\\sim d^{-4}$, where $d$ is the separation between branes.

Its evolution is delayed due to a\nformation time, during which the baryon-free fluid neither thermalizes nor\ninteracts with the baryon-rich fluids. After the formation it starts to\ninteract with the baryon-rich fluids and quickly gets thermalized. Within this\nmodel with pure hadronic equation of state, a systematic analysis of various\nobservables at incident energies between few and about 160A GeV has been done\nas well as comparison with results of transport models. We have succeeded to\nreasonably reproduce a great body of experimental data in the incident energy\nrange of E_{lab} = (1-160)A GeV. The list includes proton and pion rapidity\ndistributions, proton transverse-mass spectra, rapidity distributions of Lambda\nand antiLambda hyperons, elliptic flow of protons and pions (with the exception\nof proton v2 at 40A GeV), multiplicities of pions, positive kaons, phi-mesons,\nhyperons and antihyperons, including multi-strange particles. This agreement is\nachieved on the expense of substantial enhancement of the interflow friction as\ncompared to that estimated proceeding from hadronic free cross sections.\nHowever, we have also found out certain problems. The calculated yield of K^-\nis approximately by a factor of 1.5 higher than that in the experiment. We have\nalso failed to describe directed transverse flow of protons and pion at E_{lab}\n> 40A GeV. This failure apparently indicates that the used EoS is too hard and\nthereby leaves room for a phase transition. \n\n"}

We obtain a lower bound of 1/3 on\nthe slope-parameter $\\rho^2 \\equiv -\\xi^\\prime(1)$, which, in calculations with\nrealistic input, is exceeded by a great deal: agreement with experimental data\nrequiring $\\rho^2 \\sim 1.2 - 1.6$. The flavour and momentum dependence of the\nlight-quark propagators has observable consequences. \n\n"}

Abstract: We examine Pb+Pb collisions at CERN SPS energy 158 A GeV, by employing the\nearlier developed and recently refined parton-cascade/cluster-hadronization\nmodel and its Monte Carlo implementation. This space-time model involves the\ndynamical interplay of perturbative QCD parton production and evolution, with\nnon-perturbative parton-cluster formation and hadron production through cluster\ndecays. Using computer simulations, we are able to follow the entwined\ntime-evolution of parton and hadron degrees of freedom in both position and\nmomentum space, from the instant of nuclear overlap to the final yield of\nparticles. We present and discuss results for the multiplicity distributions,\nwhich agree well with the measured data from the CERN SPS, including those for\nK mesons. The transverse momentum distributions of the produced hadrons are\nalso found to be in good agreement with the preliminary data measured by the\nNA49 and the WA98 collaboration for the collision of lead nuclei at the CERN\nSPS. The analysis of the time evolution of transverse energy deposited in the\ncollision zone and the energy density suggests an existence of partonic matter\nfor a time of more than 5 fm. \n\n"}
