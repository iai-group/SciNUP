Possible astrophysical sources of high\nenergy particles at high latitudes include type Ia supernovae (SNe) and\nmillisecond pulsars (MSPs).

Since the cross section is defined through final states containing the\ntop decay products, a consistent definition of the cross section depends on\nprescriptions how these final states are accounted for the cross section.\nExperimentally, these prescriptions are implemented for example through cuts on\nkinematic quantities such as the reconstructed top quark invariant masses. As\nlong as these cuts do not reject final states that can arise from the decay of\na top and an anti-top quark with a small off-shellness compatible with the\nnonrelativistic power-counting, they can be implemented through imaginary phase\nspace matching conditions in NRQCD.

The ILC has\nan ambitious physics program, which will extend and complement that of the\nLarge Hadron Collider (LHC). A hallmark of physics at the ILC is precision. The\nclean initial state and the comparatively benign environment of a lepton\ncollider are ideally suited to high precision measurements. To take full\nadvantage of the physics potential of ILC places great demands on the detector\nperformance. The design of ILD is driven by these requirements. Excellent\ncalorimetry and tracking are combined to obtain the best possible overall event\nreconstruction, including the capability to reconstruct individual particles\nwithin jets for particle ow calorimetry. This requires excellent spatial\nresolution for all detector systems. A highly granular calorimeter system is\ncombined with a central tracker which stresses redundancy and efficiency.

They are conceptually\nelegant and use the only mechanism of spontaneous breaking of a gauge symmetry\nthat is known to occur in nature. The simplest model, minimal technicolor with\nextended technicolor interactions, is appealing because one can calculate by\nscaling up from QCD. But it is ruled out on many counts: inappropriately low\nquark and lepton masses (or excessive FCNC), bad electroweak data fits, light\nscalar and vector states, etc. However, nature may not choose the minimal model\nand then we are stuck: except possibly through lattice simulations, we are\nunable to compute and test the models. In the LHC era it therefore makes sense\nto abandon specific models (of strong EW breaking) and concentrate on generic\nfeatures that may indicate discovery. The Technicolor Straw Man is not a model\nbut a parametrized search strategy inspired by a remarkable generic feature of\nwalking technicolor, that technivector mesons are light, narrow and decay\nreadily into electroweak vector mesons and photons. While walking technicolor\nis popular among practitioners, alternatives exist and the Straw Man may not\nlead to their discovery. \n\n"}

Using the shrinking spectral estimates between $L^p$ and $L^q$ we\nalso show that when $(p,q)$ are within the interior of the admissible range,\none can obtain a logarithmic improvement over the parabolic region for\nresolvent estimates on manifolds equipped with Riemannian metric of\nnon-positive sectional curvature, and a power improvement depending on the\nexponent $(p,q)$ for flat torus. The latter therefore partially improves Shen's\nwork in \\cite{Shen} on the $L^p\\to L^2$ uniform resolvent estimates on the\ntorus. Similar to the case as proved in \\cite{bssy} when\n$(p,q)=(2n/(n+2),2n/(n-2))$, the parabolic region is also optimal over the\nround sphere $S^n$ when $(p,q)$ are now in the admissible range. However, we\nmay ask if the admissible range is sharp in the sense that it is the only\npossible range on the Sobolev line for which a compact manifold can have\nuniform resolvent estimate for $\\zeta$ being ouside a parabola. \n\n"}

The main goal is the\nrigorous justification of diffusion phenomena in fluid plasma at the linear\nlevel.

To solve the dKP equation we use a\ncoordinate transformation inspired by the method of characteristics for the\none-dimensional Hopf equation $u_t+uu_x=0$. We show numerically that the\nsolutions to the transformed equation do not develop shocks.

This overturned solution is\nmultivalued in a lip shape region in the $(x,y)$ plane, where the solution of\nthe dKP equation exists in a weak sense only, and a shock front develops.

The basic microlocal approach entails, first of all, the solution\nof a single, nonlinear equation of Hamilton-Jacobi type followed by the\nintegration (for both ground and excited states) of a sequence of linear\n'transport' equations along the 'flow' generated by the 'fundamental solution'\nto the aforementioned Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Using a combination of the\ndirect method of the calculus of variations, elliptic regularity theory and the\nBanach space version of the implicit function theorem we establish, in a\nsuitable function space setting, the existence, uniqueness and global\nregularity of this needed 'fundamental solution' to the relevant, Euclidean\nsignature Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the systems under study. Our methods are\napplicable to (massive) scalar fields with polynomial self-interactions of\nrenormalizable type. They can, as we shall show elsewhere, also be applied to\nYang-Mills fields in 2 + 1 and 3 + 1 dimensions. \n\n"}

The original time evolution technique is extended to a new operator\nthat provides a systematic way to calculate not only eigenvalues of ground\nstate but also of excited states. This new method systematically produces\neigenvalues with accuracies of eleven digits with the Cornell potential that\ncovers non-perturbative regime. An absolute error estimation technique based on\na power counting rule is implemented. This method is examined with exactly\nsolvable problems and produces the numerical accuracy down to 10$^{-11}$. \n\n"}
{"id": "physics/0610111", "contents": "Title: Classical evolution of fractal measures on the lattice Abstract: We consider the classical evolution of a lattice of non-linear coupled\noscillators for a special case of initial conditions resembling the equilibrium\nstate of a macroscopic thermal system at the critical point. The displacements\nof the oscillators define initially a fractal measure on the lattice associated\nwith the scaling properties of the order parameter fluctuations in the\ncorresponding critical system. Assuming a sudden symmetry breaking (quench),\nleading to a change in the equilibrium position of each oscillator, we\ninvestigate in some detail the deformation of the initial fractal geometry as\ntime evolves. In particular we show that traces of the critical fractal measure\ncan sustain for large times and we extract the properties of the chain which\ndetermine the associated time-scales. Our analysis applies generally to\ncritical systems for which, after a slow developing phase where equilibrium\nconditions are justified, a rapid evolution, induced by a sudden symmetry\nbreaking, emerges in time scales much shorter than the corresponding relaxation\nor observation time. In particular, it can be used in the fireball evolution in\na heavy-ion collision experiment, where the QCD critical point emerges, or in\nthe study of evolving fractals of astrophysical and cosmological scales, and\nmay lead to determination of the initial critical properties of the Universe\nthrough observations in the symmetry broken phase. \n\n"}
{"id": "physics/0610206", "contents": "Title: Efficient numerical diagonalization of hermitian 3x3 matrices Abstract: A very common problem in science is the numerical diagonalization of\nsymmetric or hermitian 3x3 matrices. Since standard \"black box\" packages may be\ntoo inefficient if the number of matrices is large, we study several\nalternatives. We consider optimized implementations of the Jacobi, QL, and\nCuppen algorithms and compare them with an analytical method relying on\nCardano's formula for the eigenvalues and on vector cross products for the\neigenvectors. Jacobi is the most accurate, but also the slowest method, while\nQL and Cuppen are good general purpose algorithms. The analytical algorithm\noutperforms the others by more than a factor of 2, but becomes inaccurate or\nmay even fail completely if the matrix entries differ greatly in magnitude.\nThis can mostly be circumvented by using a hybrid method, which falls back to\nQL if conditions are such that the analytical calculation might become too\ninaccurate. For all algorithms, we give an overview of the underlying\nmathematical ideas, and present detailed benchmark results.

{"id": "physics/9910004", "contents": "Title: Foam: Multi-Dimensional General Purpose Monte Carlo Generator With\n  Self-Adapting Simplical Grid Abstract: A new general purpose Monte Carlo event generator with self-adapting grid\nconsisting of simplices is described. In the process of initialization, the\nsimplex-shaped cells divide into daughter subcells in such a way that: (a) cell\ndensity is biggest in areas where integrand is peaked, (b) cells elongate\nthemselves along hyperspaces where integrand is enhanced/singular. The grid is\nanisotropic, i.e. memory of the axes directions of the primary reference frame\nis lost. In particular, the algorithm is capable of dealing with distributions\nfeaturing strong correlation among variables (like ridge along diagonal). The\npresented algorithm is complementary to others known and commonly used in the\nMonte Carlo event generators. It is, in principle, more effective then any\nother one for distributions with very complicated patterns of singularities -\nthe price to pay is that it is memory-hungry. It is therefore aimed at a small\nnumber of integration dimensions (<10). It should be combined with other\nmethods for higher dimension.
