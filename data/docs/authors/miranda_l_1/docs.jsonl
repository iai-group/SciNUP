Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on\nthe role that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in\nglobular clusters, e.g., influencing the distribution of horizontal branch\nstars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of some globular clusters, and in\nforming low mass white dwarfs. \n\n"}

High-angular-degree p modes Abstract: Turbulent motions in stellar convection zones generate acoustic energy, part\nof which is then supplied to normal modes of the star. Their amplitudes result\nfrom a balance between the efficiencies of excitation and damping processes in\nthe convection zones. We develop a formalism that provides the excitation rates\nof non-radial global modes excited by turbulent convection. As a first\napplication, we estimate the impact of non-radial effects on excitation rates\nand amplitudes of high-angular-degree modes which are observed on the Sun. A\nmodel of stochastic excitation by turbulent convection has been developed to\ncompute the excitation rates, and it has been successfully applied to solar\nradial modes (Samadi & Goupil 2001, Belkacem et al. 2006b). We generalize this\napproach to the case of non-radial global modes. This enables us to estimate\nthe energy supplied to high-($\\ell$) acoustic modes. Qualitative arguments as\nwell as numerical calculations are used to illustrate the results. We find that\nnon-radial effects for $p$ modes are non-negligible:\n  - for high-$n$ modes (i.e. typically $n > 3$) and for high values of $\\ell$;\nthe power supplied to the oscillations depends on the mode inertia.\n  - for low-$n$ modes, independent of the value of $\\ell$, the excitation is\ndominated by the non-diagonal components of the Reynolds stress term.

Mid and far-infrared\nemission from E galaxies is a combination of circumstellar or interstellar\nemission from local mass-losing red giant stars, dust buoyantly transported\nfrom the galactic cores into distant hot interstellar gas and dust accreted\nfrom the environment. The source of mid and far-IR emission in S0 galaxies is\nquite different and is consistent with low levels of star formation, 0.02 - 0.2\nMsol/yr, in cold, dusty gaseous disks.

More than\na century after its discovery, this \"Blazhko effect\" still lacks acceptable\ntheoretical understanding. In one of the plausible models for explaining the\nphenomenon, the modulation is caused by the effects of a magnetic field. So\nfar, the available observational data have not allowed us to either support nor\nrule out the presence of a magnetic field in RR Lyrae stars. We intend to\ndetermine whether RR Lyrae stars are generally characterized by the presence of\na magnetic field organized on a large scale. With the help of the FORS1\ninstrument at the ESO VLT we performed a spectropolarimetric survey of 17\nrelatively bright southern RR Lyrae stars, both Blazhko stars and non-modulated\nstars, and determined their mean longitudinal magnetic field with a typical\nerror bar < 30 G. All our measurements of the mean longitudinal magnetic field\nresulted in null detections within 3 sigma. From our data we can set an upper\nlimit for the strength of the dipole component of the magnetic fields of RR\nLyrae stars to ~ 130 G. Because of the limitations intrinsic to the diagnostic\ntechnique, we cannot exclude the presence of higher order multipolar\ncomponents. The outcome of this survey clarifies that the Blazhko modulation in\nthe pulsation of RR Lyrae stars is not correlated with the presence of a\nstrong, quasi-dipolar magnetic field. \n\n"}

The framework\nis developed from a randomized initial condition that leads to a sample of\nsimulated SN Ia whose Ni56 masses have a similar average and range to those\nobserved, and have many other modestly realistic features such as the velocity\nextent of intermediate mass elements. The intended purpose is to enable\nstatistically well-defined studies of both physical and theoretical parameters\nof the SN Ia explosion simulation. We present here a thorough description of\nthe outcome of the SN Ia explosions produced by our current simulations. A\nfirst application of this framework is utilized to study the dependence of the\nSN Ia on the Ne22 content, which is known to be directly influenced by the\nprogenitor stellar population's metallicity.

We find that the predicted epicyclic overdensities arise in any\ntidal tail no matter which orbit the cluster follows as long as the cluster\nlives long enough for the overdensities to build up.\n  The distance of the overdensities along the tidal tail from the cluster\ncentre depends for circular orbits only on the mass of the cluster and the\nstrength of the tidal field, and therefore decreases monotonically with time,\nwhile for eccentric orbits the orbital motion influences the distance, causing\na periodic compression and stretching of the tails and making the distance\noscillate with time. We provide an approximation for estimating the distance of\nthe overdensities in this case.\n  We describe an additional type of overdensity which arises in extended tidal\ntails of clusters on eccentric orbits, when the acceleration of the tidal field\non the stellar stream is no longer homogeneous. Moreover, we conclude that a\npericentre passage or a disk shock is not the direct origin of an overdensity\nwithin a tidal tail.

These spectra are used alongside other VLT/FLAMES and\nNTT/EMMI spectra to follow the evolution of W243 from 2002 to 2009. W243\ndisplays a complex, time-varying spectrum with emission lines of Hydrogen,\nHelium and Lyman-pumped metals, forbidden lines of Nitrogen and Iron, and a\nlarge number of absorption lines from neutral and singly-ionized metals. Many\nlines are complex emission/absorption blends. The LBV has a current temperature\nof ~8500K (spectral type A3Ia+), and displays signs of photospheric pulsations\nand weak episodic mass loss. Nitrogen is highly overabundant, with Carbon and\nOxygen depleted, indicative of surface CNO-processed material and considerable\nprevious mass-loss, although current time-averaged mass-loss rates are low. The\nemission-line spectrum forms at large radii, when material lost by the LBV in a\nprevious mass-loss event is ionized by an unseen hot companion.

This process represents a path alternative to thermonuclear\ndisruption of accreting white dwarfs in Type Ia supernovae. Neutrino and\ngravitational-wave (GW) observations may provide crucial information necessary\nto reveal a potential AIC. Motivated by the need for systematic predictions of\nthe GW signature of AIC, we present results from an extensive set of\ngeneral-relativistic AIC simulations using a microphysical finite-temperature\nequation of state and an approximate treatment of deleptonization during\ncollapse. Investigating a set of 114 progenitor models in rotational\nequilibrium, with a wide range of rotational configurations, temperatures and\ncentral densities, we extend previous Newtonian studies and find that the GW\nsignal has a generic shape akin to what is known as a \"Type III\" signal in the\nliterature.

It is shown that even without a detailed calculation of the\npressure anisotropy or the heat fluxes, one finds the macroscale dynamics to be\ngenerically unstable to microscale Alfvenically polarized fluctuations. Two\ninstabilities are considered in detail: the parallel firehose instability\n(including the finite-Larmor-radius effects that determine the fastest growing\nmode) and the gyrothermal instability (GTI).

These confirm the existence of a\ncritical ablation rate above which the corona is condensed, and imply that for\nthe likely parameters of the Galactic corona this rate lies near the actual\nablation rate of clouds.

We perform a series of tests including the time\nintegration of circular and elliptical orbits, the collapse of a Bonnor-Ebert\nsphere and a rotating, fragmenting cloud core. We compare the collapse of a\nhighly unstable singular isothermal sphere to the theory by Shu (1977), and\nshow that the sink particle accretion rate is in excellent agreement with the\ntheoretical prediction.\n  To model eccentric orbits and close encounters of sink particles accurately,\nwe show that a very small timestep is often required, for which we implemented\nsubcycling of the N-body system. We emphasize that a sole density threshold for\nsink particle creation is insufficient in supersonic flows, if the density\nthreshold is below the opacity limit. In that case, the density can exceed the\nthreshold in strong shocks that do not necessarily lead to local collapse.\nAdditional checks for bound state, gravitational potential minimum, Jeans\ninstability and converging flows are absolutely necessary for a meaningful\ncreation of sink particles.\n  We apply our new sink particle module for FLASH to the formation of a stellar\ncluster, and compare to a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code with sink\nparticles. Our comparison shows encouraging agreement of gas properties,\nindicated by column density distributions and radial profiles, and of sink\nparticle formation times and positions.

The Fermi telescope provides a new opportunity to test particle\ndark matter models through the expected gamma-ray emission produced by pair\nannihilation of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). Local Group dwarf\nspheroidal galaxies, the largest galactic substructures predicted by the cold\ndark matter scenario, are attractive targets for such indirect searches for\ndark matter because they are nearby and among the most extreme dark matter\ndominated environments. No significant gamma-ray emission was detected above\n100 MeV from the candidate dwarf galaxies.

We simulate\nthe effect of extra mixing on the FGB by setting the composition of the\nenvelope to that observed in low-mass FGB stars, and then evolve the models to\nthe tip of the AGB. The inclusion of FGB extra mixing compositional changes has\na strong effect on the C and N abundance in our AGB models, leading to\ncompositions consistent with those measured in Galactic C-rich stars. The\ncomposition of the models is also consistent with C abundances measured in\nmainstream silicon carbide grains. While our models cover the range of C\nabundances measured in C stars in NGC 1846, we cannot simultaneously match the\ncomposition of the O and C-rich stars.

First, we consider a disk-like grain rotating with angular velocity at\nan arbitrary angle with respect to the grain symmetry axis and derive the\nrotational damping and excitation coefficients arising from infrared emission,\nplasma-grain interactions and electric dipole emission. The angular velocity\ndistribution and the electric dipole emission spectrum for grains is calculated\nusing the Langevin equation, for cases both with and without fast internal\nrelaxation.

Yet, the presence of a baryonic disc is\nbelieved to alter the shape of the haloes. Here we aim to study how bar\nformation is affected by halo triaxiality and how, in turn, the presence of the\nbar influences the shape of the halo. We perform a set of collisionless N-body\nsimulations of disc galaxies with triaxial dark matter haloes, using elliptical\ndiscs as initial conditions. We study models of different halo triaxialities\nand, to investigate the behaviour of the halo shape in the absence of bar\nformation, we run models with different disc masses, halo concentrations, disc\nvelocity dispersions and also models where the disc shape is kept artificially\naxisymmetric. We find that the introduction of a massive disc causes the halo\ntriaxiality to be partially diluted. Once the disc is fully grown, a strong\nstellar bar develops within the halo that is still non-axisymmetric, causing it\nto lose its remaining non-axisymmetry. In triaxial haloes in which the initial\nconditions are such that a bar does not form, the halo is able to remain\ntriaxial and the circularisation of its shape on the plane of the disc is\nlimited to the period of disc growth. We conclude that part of the\ncircularisation of the halo is due to disc growth, but part must be attributed\nto the formation of a bar. We find that initially circular discs respond\nexcessively to the triaxial potential and become highly elongated. They also\nlose more angular momentum than the initially elliptical discs and thus form\nstronger bars. Because of that, the circularisation that their bars induce on\ntheir haloes is also more rapid.

We refined the determination of the disk galaxies rotation\nvelocity, with a dynamical recipe for the rotation curve, rather than a simple\nconversion from the total mass to maximum velocity. The new recipe takes into\naccount the disk shape factor, and the angular momentum transfer occurring\nduring secular evolution leading to the formation of bulges. This produces\nmodel rotation velocities that are lower by ~20-25% for the majority of the\nspirals. We implemented stellar population models with a complete treatment of\nthe TP-AGB, which leads to a revision of the mass-to-light ratio in the\nnear-IR.

With these two new recipes in place, the comparison between\nthe predicted Tully-Fisher relation with a series of datasets in the optical\nand near-IR, at redshifts between 0 and 1, is used as a diagnostics of the\nassembly and evolution of spiral galaxies in the model. At 0.4<z<1.2 the match\nbetween the new model and data is remarkably good, especially for later-type\nspirals (Sb/Sc).

We argue that\nthis behaviour is caused by inadequate star formation histories in the model\ngalaxies at low redshifts. The star-formation rate declines too slowly, due to\ncontinuous gas infall that is not efficiently suppressed.

With this, observations of the multiple star system\ncontaining the merger product(s) can be used to work backwards in order to\nconstrain the initial orbital energies of any single, binary or triple systems\nthat went into the encounter. The initial semi-major axes of the orbits provide\nan estimate for the collisional cross section and therefore the time-scale for\nthe encounter to occur in its host cluster.

Using\naxisymmetric hydrodynamic simulations with a self-consistent treatment of the\ndynamical cosmic ray (CR) - gas interaction, we show that the bubbles can be\ncreated with a recent active galactic nucleus (AGN) jet activity about 1 - 3\nMyr ago, which was active for a duration of ~ 0.1 - 0.5 Myr. The bipolar jets\nwere ejected into the Galactic halo along the rotation axis of the Galaxy. Near\nthe GC, the jets must be moderately light with a typical density contrast 0.001\n<~ \\eta <~ 0.1 relative to the ambient hot gas. The jets are energetically\ndominated by kinetic energy, and over-pressured with either CR or thermal\npressure which induces lateral jet expansion, creating fat CR bubbles as\nobserved.

This is possible if the\nmassive AGBs of [Fe/H]>-1.3 in the progenitor system evolve when all the\npristine gas surrounding the cluster has been exhausted by the previous star\nformation events, or the proto--cluster interaction with the Galaxy caused the\nloss of a significant fraction of its mass, or of its dark matter halo, and the\nsupernova ejecta have been able to clear the gas out of the system. The absence\nof dilution in the metal richer populations lends further support to a scenario\nof the formation of second generation stars in cooling flows from massive AGB\nprogenitors. We suggest that the entire formation of omega Cen took place in a\nfew 10^8yr, and discuss the problem of a prompt formation of s--process\nelements. \n\n"}

However, some recent observations showed that the expected number\nof the mass-accreting WD is much lower than that predicted from theory,\nwhatever in spiral or elliptical galaxies. In this paper, we did a binary\npopulation synthesis study on the relative duration of the SSS phase to their\nwhole mass-increasing phase of WDs leading to SNe Ia. We found that for about\n40% progenitor systems, the relative duration is shorter than 2% and the\nevolution of the mean relative duration shows that it is always smaller than\n5%, whatever for young or old SNe Ia. In addition, before SNe Ia explosion,\nmore than 55% progenitor systems are experiencing a dwarf novae phase, and only\nno more than 10% is staying SSS phase. These results are consistent with the\nrecent observations, and imply that both in early- and late-type galaxies, only\na small fraction of mass-accreting WD resulting in SNe Ia contribute to the\nsupersoft X-ray flux. So, although our results are not directly related to the\nX-ray output of SN Ia progenitor, the low supersoft X-ray luminosity observed\nin early type galaxies may have no ability to exclude the validity of SD model.\nOn the contrary, it is evidence to support the SD scenario. \n\n"}

An explosive transient with\nan un-observed shock break-out luminosity of order 10^10 Lsun is required to\nrender the transients little obscured and visible in the optical at their\npeaks. Such a large break-out luminosity then implies that the progenitor stars\nwere cool, red supergiants, most probably ~9 Msun extreme AGB (EAGB) stars. As\nthe shocks generated by the explosions propagate outward through the dense\nwind, they produce a shock luminosity in soft X-rays that powers the long-lived\nluminosity of the transients. Unlike typical cases of transients exploding into\na surrounding circumstellar medium, the progenitor winds in these systems are\noptically thick to soft X-rays, easily absorb radio emission and rapidly reform\ndust destroyed by the peak luminosity of the transients. As a result, X-rays\nare absorbed by the gas and the energy is ultimately radiated by the reformed\ndust. Three years post-peak, both systems are still significantly more luminous\nthan their progenitor stars, but they are again fully shrouded by the re-formed\ndust and only visible in the mid-IR.

However, in the event of a merger,\ngravitational-wave (GW) recoil may displace a SMBH from its galactic center, or\neject it entirely. To explore the consequences of this phenomenon, we use\nhydrodynamic simulations of gaseous galaxy mergers that include a range of BH\nrecoil velocities. We have generated a suite of over 200 simulations with more\nthan 60 merger models, enabling us to identify systematic trends in the\nbehavior of recoiling BHs -- specifically (i) their dynamics, (ii) their\nobservable signatures, and (iii) their effects on BH/galaxy co-evolution. (i)\nRecoiling BH trajectories depend heavily on the gas content of the host galaxy;\nmaximal BH displacements from the center may vary by up to an order of\nmagnitude between gas-rich and gas-poor mergers. In some cases, recoil\ntrajectories also depend on the timing of the BH merger relative to the\nformation of the galaxy merger remnant. (ii) Recoiling BHs may be observable as\noffset active galactic nuclei (AGN) via either kinematic offsets (v > 800 km\ns^-1) or spatial offsets (R > 1 kpc) for lifetimes of about 1 - 100 Myr. In\naddition, recoil events affect the total AGN lifetime. GW recoil generally\nreduces the lifetimes of bright AGN, but may extend lower-luminosity AGN\nlifetimes. (iii) Rapidly-recoiling BHs may be up to about 5 times less massive\nthan their stationary counterparts. These mass deficits lower the normalization\nof the M - sigma relation and contribute to both intrinsic and overall scatter.\nFurthermore, recoil events displace AGN feedback from the galactic center,\nwhich enhances central star formation rates. This results in longer starburst\nphases and higher central stellar densities in merger remnants. \n\n"}

This is the\nsecond part of a series of papers and we study the correlations between the AGN\nactivities and host galaxy properties. Based on a sample of AGNs identified\nwith the new method developed in Paper-I, we find that AGNs typically show\nextinction of tau_V=1.2 and they exhibit a wide range of ionization levels. The\nlatter finding motivates us to use [OII]+[OIII] luminosity as an indicator of\nAGN power. We find that AGNs are preferentially located in massive, red,\nearly-type galaxies. By carefully taking into account a selection bias of the\nOxygen-excess method, we show that strong AGNs are located in actively star\nforming galaxies and rapidly growing super-massive black holes are located in\nrapidly growing galaxies, which clearly shows the co-evolution of super-massive\nblack holes and the host galaxies. This is a surprising phenomenon given that\nthe growths of black holes and host galaxies occur at very different physical\nscales.

Previous work has shown that the thermal wind\nequation together with informal arguments on the nature of convection in a\nrotating fluid could be used to deduce the shape of the isorotation surfaces in\nthe bulk of the SCZ with great fidelity, and that the tachocline contours could\nalso be described by relatively simple phenomenology. In this paper, we show\nthat the form of these surfaces can be understood more broadly as a\nmathematical consequence of the thermal wind equation and a narrow convective\nshell. The analysis does not yield the angular velocity function directly, an\nadditional surface boundary condition is required. But much can already be\ndeduced without constructing the entire rotation profile. The mathematics may\nbe combined with dynamical arguments put forth in previous works to the mutual\nbenefit of each.

The difference between the dynamics of the bulk of the\nSCZ and the tachocline is due to a different functional form of the residual\nentropy in each region.

These characteristics are identical to the\nisorotation contours in the bulk of the SCZ, but the two deviate in the\ntachocline.

The changes in the expected abundances that we\nfind are primarily due to the following reasons. i) Enhancing the neutron\nsource increases the efficiency of the s process, so that the ensuing stellar\nyields now mimic the solar distribution at a metallicity higher than before\n([Fe/H]>=-0.1). ii) The age-metallicity relation is rather flat for several Gyr\nin that metallicity regime, so that those conditions remain stable and the\nenhanced nuclear yields, which are necessary to maintain a solar-like abundance\npattern, can dominate the composition of the interstellar medium from which\nsubsequent stars are formed. \n\n"}

Our aim is to determine precisely the abundance distribution of HDO\ntowards the low-mass protostar IRAS16293-2422 and learn more about the water\nformation mechanisms by determining the HDO/H2O abundance ratio. A spectral\nsurvey of the source IRAS16293-2422 was carried out in the framework of the\nCHESS Herschel Key program with the HIFI instrument, allowing the detection of\nnumerous HDO lines. Other transitions have been observed previously with\nground-based telescopes. The spherical Monte Carlo radiative transfer code\nRATRAN was used to reproduce the observed line profiles of HDO by assuming an\nabundance jump. To determine the H2O abundance throughout the envelope, a\nsimilar study was made of the H2-18O observed lines, as the H2O main isotope\nlines are contaminated by the outflows. We derive an inner HDO abundance of\n1.7e-7 and an outer HDO abundance of 8e-11. To reproduce the HDO absorption\nlines, it is necessary to add an absorbing layer in front of the envelope. It\nmay correspond to a water-rich layer created by the photodesorption of the ices\nat the edges of the molecular cloud. The HDO/H2O ratio is ~1.4-5.8% in the hot\ncorino whereas it is ~0.2-2.2% in the outer envelope. It is estimated at ~4.8%\nin the added absorbing layer. Although it is clearly higher than the cosmic D/H\nabundance, the HDO/H2O ratio remains lower than the D/H ratio derived for other\ndeuterated molecules observed in the same source. The similarity of the ratios\nderived in the hot corino and in the added absorbing layer suggests that water\nformed before the gravitational collapse of the protostar, contrary to\nformaldehyde and methanol, which formed later once the CO molecules had\ndepleted on the grains. \n\n"}

Abstract: Magnetic Doppler imaging is currently the most powerful method of\ninterpreting high-resolution spectropolarimetric observations of stars. This\ntechnique has revealed the presence of unexpected small-scale magnetic fields\non the surfaces of Ap stars. These studies were recently criticisied by Stift\net al.

We show that\nStift et al. misinterpreted published magnetic Doppler imaging results and\nneglected some of the most fundamental principles behind magnetic mapping. We\ndemonstrate that the variation of atmospheric structure across the surface of a\nstar with chemical spots affects the local continuum intensity but is\nnegligible for the normalised local Stokes profiles. For the disk-integrated\nspectra of an Ap star with extreme abundance variations, we find that the\nassumption of a mean model atmosphere leads to moderate errors in Stokes I but\nis negligible for polarisation spectra. Employing a new magnetic inversion\ncode, which incorporates the horizontal variation of atmospheric structure, we\nreconstructed new maps of magnetic field and Fe abundance for the Ap star\nalpha^2 CVn. The resulting distribution of chemical spots changes\ninsignificantly compared to the previous modelling based on a single model\natmosphere, while the magnetic field geometry does not change at all.

Assuming that the polarization is purely due to the Goldreich-Kylafis\neffect, the linear polarization direction is defined by the magnetic field as\neven the small Zeeman splitting of CO and SiO dominates the molecular\ncollisional and spontaneous emission rates.

We introduce a novel method of data randomization to evaluate\nquantitatively the effect of these biases and to assess the intrinsic\nsignificance of an apparent correlation between radio and gamma-ray flux\ndensities of blazars. The novelty of the method lies in a combination of data\nrandomization in luminosity space (to ensure that the randomized data are\nintrinsically, and not just apparently, uncorrelated) and significance\nassessment in flux space (to explicitly avoid Malmquist bias and automatically\naccount for the limited dynamical range in both frequencies). The method is\napplicable even to small samples that are not selected with strict statistical\ncriteria.

We show that cooling of high-velocity,\nshocked winds in AGN is in fact inefficient in a wide range of circumstances,\nincluding conditions relevant to ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs),\nresulting in energy-conserving outflows. We further show that fast\nenergy-conserving outflows can tolerate a large amount of mixing with cooler\ngas before radiative losses become important. For winds with initial velocity\nv_in>~10,000 km s^-1, as observed in ultra-violet and X-ray absorption, the\nshocked wind develops a two-temperature structure. While most of the thermal\npressure support is provided by the protons, the cooling processes operate\ndirectly only on the electrons. This significantly slows down inverse Compton\ncooling, while free free cooling is negligible. Slower winds with v_in~1,000 km\ns^-1, such as may be driven by radiation pressure on dust, can also experience\nenergy-conserving phases but under more restrictive conditions.

Our results show that the\nmotion of the knots is essentially ballistic, with the exception of the\nfarthest knots, which trace the large scale C-shape bending of the jet. The\nobserved bending of the jet can be produced by a relative motion of the HH 30\nstar with respect to its surrounding environment, caused either by a possible\nproper motion of the HH 30 star, or by the entrainment of environment gas by\nthe red lobe of the nearby L1551-IRS 5 outflow. Alternatively, the bending can\nbe produced by the stellar wind from a nearby CTTS, identified in the 2MASS\ncatalog. The proper motion velocities of the knots of the counterjet show more\nvariations than those of the jet. In particular, we identify two knots of the\ncounterjet that have the same kinematic age but whose velocities differ by\nalmost a factor of two. Thus, it appears that counterjet knots launched\nsimultaneously can be ejected with very different velocities. We confirm that\nthe observed wiggling of the jet and counterjet arises from the orbital motion\nof the jet source in a binary system. Precession is of secondary importance in\nshaping the jet.

Two models have been proposed to explain this\nresult. In the ADIOS model, the inward decrease of accretion rate is because of\nthe loss of gas in the outflow. In the CDAF model, the gas is assumed to be\nlocked in convective eddies, which results in the inward decrease of the\naccretion rate. We investigate the nature of inward decrease of accretion rate\nusing HD and MHD simulations. We calculate various properties of inflow and\noutflow, including the mass flux, radial and rotational velocities,\ntemperature, and the Bernoulli parameter ($Be$). Systematic and significant\ndifferences between inflow and outflow are found. These results suggest that\nthe inflow and outflow are not dominated by convective turbulence, but are\nsystematic inward and outward motion. We have also analyzed the convective\nstability of MHD accretion flow and found that they are convectively stable.\nThese results indicate that the ADIOS scenario is favored. The different\nproperties of inflow and outflow also suggest that the mechanisms of producing\noutflow in HD and MHD flows are buoyancy and centrifugal force associated with\nthe magnetic field, respectively. The latter mechanism is similar to the\nBlandford & Payne mechanism. We also study the effect of initial conditions in\nthe simulations.

It has been shown that most of the energy is\nreleased deep in the crust by pycnonuclear reactions involving low-Z elements.\nWe discuss if NSs in very-faint X-ray transients (VFXTs; those which have peak\nX-ray luminosities < 1E36 erg/s) can be used to test this model. Unfortunately\nwe cannot conclusively answer this because of the large uncertainties in our\nestimates of the accretion rate history of those VFXTs, both the short-term\n(less than a few tens of thousands of years) and the one throughout their\nlifetime. The latter is important because it can be so low that the NSs might\nnot have accreted enough matter to become massive enough that enhanced cooling\nprocesses become active. Therefore, they could be relatively warm compared to\nother systems for which such enhanced cooling processed have been inferred.\nHowever, the amount of matter can also not be too low because then the crust\nmight not have been replaced significantly by accreted matter and thus a hybrid\ncrust of partly accreted and partly original, albeit further compressed matter,\nmight be present. This would inhibit the full range of pycnonuclear reactions\nto occur and thus very likely decreasing the amount of heat deposited in the\ncrust. Furthermore, better understanding is needed how a hybrid crust affects\nother properties such as the thermal conductivity. We also show that some\nindividual NS LMXBs might have hybrid crusts as well as the NSs in HMXBs. This\nhas to be taken into account when studying the cooling properties of those\nsystems when they are in quiescence. We show that the VFXTs are likely not the\ndominate transients that are associated with the brightest low-luminosity X-ray\nsources in globular clusters as was hypothesized. \n\n"}

The model emission is in broad agreement with the\nobservations, but a few modifications are needed to obtain a good fit. Firstly,\nby adjusting the model to include two major and two minor spiral arms rather\nthan four equal spiral arms, the fit to the longitude profiles for |l|>30\ndegrees can be improved.

Metal-poor dSph stars also help to reveal the\nformation mechanism of the Milky Way halo.

However,\nin order to prevent catastrophic cooling, the ICM must be heated in a\nnear-isotropic fashion and narrow bipolar jets with $P_{\\rm jet}=10^{44-45}$\nergs/s, typical of radio AGNs at cluster centres, are inefficient at heating\nthe gas in the transverse direction to the jets. We argue that due to existent\nconditions in cluster cores, the SMBHs will, in addition to accreting gas via\nradiatively inefficient flows, experience short stochastic episodes of enhanced\naccretion via thin discs. In general, the orientation of these accretion discs\nwill be misaligned with the spin axis of the black holes and the ensuing\ntorques will cause the black hole's spin axis (and therefore, the jet axis) to\nslew and rapidly change direction. This model not only explains recent\nobservations showing successive generations of jet-lobes-bubbles in individual\ncool-core clusters that are offset from each other in the angular direction\nwith respect to the cluster center, but also shows that AGN jets {\\it can} heat\nthe cluster core nearly isotropically on the gas cooling timescale.

Large statistical samples of young stars across star-forming regions\nare needed to trigger a breakthrough in our understanding, but most optical\nstudies are based on a wide variety of spectrographs and analysis methods,\nwhich introduces large biases.

These unusual features appear to\narise in a small region near Herschel 36 which contains most of the neutral\ninterstellar material in the sight line. The CH+ and CH in that region are\nradiatively excited by strong far-IR radiation from the adjacent infrared\nsource Her 36 SE. Similarly, the broadening of the DIBs toward Herschel 36 may\nbe due to radiative pumping of closely spaced high-J rotational levels of\nrelatively small, polar carrier molecules.

The width\nof the broad Balmer line is a direct indicator of the downstream plasma\ntemperature. In case of efficient particle acceleration an appreciable fraction\nof the total kinetic energy of the plasma is channeled into CRs, therefore the\ndownstream temperature decreases and so does the broad Balmer line width. This\nwidth also depends on the level of thermal equilibration between ions and\nneutral hydrogen atoms in the downstream. Since in general in young SNR shocks\nonly a few charge exchange (CE) reactions occur before ionization,\nequilibration between ions and neutrals is not reached, and a kinetic\ndescription of the neutrals is required in order to properly compute Balmer\nemission.\n  We provide a method for the calculation of Balmer emission using a\nself-consistent description of the shock structure in the presence of neutrals\nand CRs. We use a recently developed semi-analytical approach, where neutral\nparticles, ionized plasma, accelerated particles and magnetic fields are all\ncoupled together through the mass, momentum and energy flux conservation\nequations. The distribution of neutrals is obtained from the full Boltzmann\nequation in velocity space, coupled to Maxwellian ions through ionization and\nCE processes.

Instead,\nthe evidence points to low [alpha/Fe] ratios resulting from an initial mass\nfunction (IMF) deficient in the highest mass stars. The critical evidence is\nthe 0.4 dex deficiency of [O/Fe], [Mg/Fe] and other hydrostatic elements,\ncontrasting with the normal trend of r-process [Eu/Fe]r with [Fe/H]. Supporting\nevidence comes from the hydrostatic element (O, Mg, Na, Al, Cu) [X/Fe] ratios,\nwhich are inconsistent with iron added to the Milky Way (MW) disk trends. Also,\nthe ratio of hydrostatic to explosive (Si, Ca, Ti) element abundances suggests\na relatively top-light IMF. Abundance similarities with the LMC, Fornax and IC\n1613, suggest that their alpha-element deficiencies also resulted from IMFs\nlacking the most massive SNII.\n  For such a top-light IMF, the normal trend of r-process [Eu/Fe]r with [Fe/H],\nas seen in Sgr, indicates that massive Type II supernovae (>30Msun) cannot be\nmajor sources of r-process elements.\n  High [La/Y] ratios, consistent with leaky-box chemical evolution, are\nconfirmed but ~0.3 dex larger than theoretical AGB predictions. This may be due\nto the 13C pocket mass, or a difference between MW and Sgr AGB stars. Sgr has\nthe lowest [Rb/Zr] ratios known, consistent with low-mass (~2Msun) AGB stars\nnear [Fe/H]=-0.6, likely resulting from leaky-box chemical evolution.\n  The [Cu/O] trend in Sgr and the MW suggest that Cu yields increase with both\nmetallicity and stellar mass, as expected from Cu production by the weak\ns-process in massive stars.\n  Finally, we present an updated hfs line list, an abundance analysis of\nArcturus, and further develop our error analysis formalism. \n\n"}

The optical light curves are\nconsistent with a sinusoidal variability modulated with the orbital period,\nshowing evidence for a strongly irradiated companion star, in agreement with\nprevious findings. The observed colours cannot be accounted for by the\ncompanion star alone, suggesting the presence of an accretion disc during\nquiescence. The system is fainter in all analysed bands compared to previous\nobservations. The R band light curve displays a possible phase offset with\nrespect to the B and V band. Through a combined fit of the multi-band light\ncurves we derive constraints on the companion star and disc fluxes, on the\nsystem distance and on the companion star mass. The irradiation luminosity\nrequired to account for the observed day-side temperature of the companion star\nis consistent with the spin-down luminosity of a millisecond radio pulsar. The\nflux decrease and spectral evolution of the quiescent optical emission observed\ncomparing our data with previous observations, collected over 5 years, cannot\nbe well explained with the contribution of an irradiated companion star and an\naccretion disc alone. The progressive flux decrease as the system gets bluer\ncould be due to a continuum component evolving towards a lower, bluer spectrum.\nWhile most of the continuum component is likely due to the disc, we do not\nexpect it to become bluer in quiescence. Hence we hypothesize that an\nadditional component, such as synchrotron emission from a jet was contributing\nsignificantly in the earlier data obtained during quiescence and then\nprogressively fading or moving its break frequency toward longer wavelengths. \n\n"}

For the first time, we\ncombine the information from gamma-rays, cosmic rays, prompt neutrinos, and\ncosmogenic neutrinos quantitatively in a joint cosmic ray production and\npropagation model, and we show that the information on the cosmic energy budget\ncan be obtained as a consequence. In addition to the neutron model, we consider\nalternative scenarios for the cosmic ray escape from the GRBs, i.e., that\ncosmic rays can leak from the sources. We find that the dip model, which\ndescribes the ankle in UHECR observations by the pair production dip, is\nstrongly disfavored in combination with the internal shock model because a)\nunrealistically high baryonic loadings (energy in protons versus energy in\nelectrons/gamma-rays) are needed for the individual GRBs and b) the prompt\nneutrino flux easily overshoots the corresponding neutrino bound.

It\nwas proposed that the mass-loss rate decreased by a factor of about 2 in the\nlast 15 years. We complement these recent results by investigating the past\nevolution and the current state of eta Car in the near-infrared (IR). Methods.\nWe present JHKL photometry of eta Car obtained at SAAO Sutherland from\n2004-2013 with the Mk II photometer at the 0.75-m telescope and JHKs photometry\nwith SIRIUS at the 1.4-m IRSF telescope from 2012-2013. The near-IR light\ncurves since 1972 are analyzed. Results. The long-term brightening trends in\neta Car's JHKL light curves were discontinuous around the 1998 periastron\npassage. After 1998, the star shows excess emission above the extrapolated\ntrend from earlier dates, foremost in J and H, and the blueward, cyclical\nprogression in its near-IR colors is accelerated. The near-IR color evolution\nis strongly correlated with the periastron passages. After correcting for the\nsecular trend we find that the color evolution matches an apparent increase in\nblackbody temperature of an optically thick near-IR emitting plasma component\nfrom about 3500 to 6000 K over the last 20 years. Conclusions. We suggest that\nthe changing near-IR emission may be caused by variability in optically thick\nbremsstrahlung emission. Periastron passages play a key role in the observed\nexcess near-IR emission after 1998 and the long-term color evolution. We thus\npropose as a hypothesis that angular momentum transfer (via tidal acceleration)\nduring periastron passages leads to sudden changes in eta Car's atmosphere\nresulting in a long-term decrease in the mass-loss rate. \n\n"}

We test the\neffectiveness of the IR luminosity as an SFR indicator by applying it to\nsynthetic spectral energy distributions generated from three-dimensional\nhydrodynamical simulations of isolated disc galaxies and galaxy mergers. In\ngeneral, the SFR inferred from the IR luminosity agrees well with the true\ninstantaneous SFR of the simulated galaxies. However, for the major mergers in\nwhich a strong starburst is induced, the SFR inferred from the IR luminosity\ncan overestimate the instantaneous SFR during the post-starburst phase by\ngreater than two orders of magnitude. Even though the instantaneous SFR\ndecreases rapidly after the starburst, the stars that were formed in the\nstarburst remain dust-obscured and thus produce significant IR luminosity.\nConsequently, use of the IR luminosity as an SFR indicator may cause one to\nconclude that post-starburst galaxies are still star-forming, whereas in\nreality, star formation was recently quenched. \n\n"}

We aim to characterize how the charge state of\nPAHs can be used as a probe of flows of gas through protoplanetary gaps. In\nthis context, our goal is to understand the PAH spectra of four transitional\ndisks. In addition, we want to explain the observed correlation between PAH\nionization (traced by the 6.2/11.3 feature ratio) and the disk mass (traced by\nthe 1.3 mm luminosity). We implement a model to calculate the charge state of\nPAHs in the radiative transfer code MCMax. The emission spectra and ionization\nbalance are calculated. A benchmark modeling grid is presented that shows how\nPAH ionization and luminosity behave as a function of star and disk properties.\nThe PAH ionization is most sensitive to ultraviolet (UV) radiation and the\nelectron density. In optically thick disks, where the UV field is low and the\nelectron density is high, PAHs are predominantly neutral. Ionized PAHs trace\nlow-density optically thin disk regions where the UV field is high and the\nelectron density is low. Such regions are characteristic of gas flows through\nthe gaps of transitional disks. We demonstrate that fitting the PAH spectra of\nfour transitional disks requires a contribution of ionized PAHs in gas flows\nthrough the gap. The PAH spectra of transitional disks can be understood as\nsuperpositions of neutral and ionized PAHs. For HD97048, neutral PAHs in the\noptically thick disk dominate the spectrum. In the cases of HD169142, HD135344B\nand Oph IRS 48, small amounts of ionized PAHs located in the gas flows through\nthe gap are strong contributors to the total PAH luminosity. The observed trend\nbetween the disk mass and PAH ionization may imply that lower-mass disks have\nlarger gaps. Ionized PAHs in gas flows through these gaps contribute strongly\nto their spectra. \n\n"}

Such a\npossibility has often been put forward in the past. We developed a Monte Carlo\nGalactic propagation code for ~MeV positrons in which the Galactic interstellar\nmedium, the Galactic magnetic field (GMF) and the propagation are finely\ndescribed. This code allows us to simulate the spatial distribution of the 511\nkeV annihilation emission. We test several GMFs models and several positron\nescape fractions from type-Ia supernova for 56Ni positrons. We consider the\ncollisional ballistic transport mode and then compare the simulated 511 keV\nintensity spatial distributions to the INTEGRAL/SPI data. Whatever the GMF\nconfiguration and the escape fraction chosen for 56Ni positrons, the 511 keV\nintensity distributions are very similar. The main reason is that ~MeV\npositrons do not propagate very far away from their birth sites in our model.\nThe direct comparison to the data does not allow us to constrain the GMF\nconfiguration and the escape fraction for 56Ni positrons. In any case,\nnucleosynthesis positrons produced in steady state cannot explain the full\nannihilation emission. The comparison to the data shows that: (a) the\nannihilation emission from the Galactic disk can be accounted for; (b) the\nstrongly peaked annihilation emission from the inner Galactic bulge can be\nexplained by positrons annihilating in the central molecular zone but this\nseems to require more positron sources than the population of massive stars and\ntype Ia supernovae usually assumed for this region; (c) the more extended\nemission from the Galactic bulge cannot be explained.

The neutrino luminosities of the stellar core\nof massive stars become larger as they get closer to the time of the core\ncollapse. As emitted neutrinos escape freely from the core, the core mass is\nsignificantly reduced when the neutrino luminosity is large. If a star is near\nthe Eddington luminosity when the neutrino luminosity is large, the star can\nexceed the Eddington luminosity because of the core neutrino mass loss. We\nsuggest that the stellar surface mass-loss rates due to the core neutrino\nemission can be higher than 1e-4 Msun/yr from ~ 1 year before the core\ncollapse. The mass-loss rates can exceed 1e-2 Msun/yr in ~ 10 days before the\ncore collapse. This mass-loss mechanism may be able to explain the enhanced\nmass loss observed in some supernova progenitors shortly before their\nexplosion.

Large deviations between the abundances of\nthe host star and its gas giants seem likely to occur if the planet formation\nfollows the core-accretion scenario. These deviations stem from the separate\nevolution of gas and dust in the disk, where the dust forms the planet cores,\nfollowed by the final run-away accretion of the left-over gas. ProDiMo\nprotoplanetary disk models are used to predict the chemical evolution of gas\nand ice in the midplane. We find that cosmic rays play a crucial role in slowly\nun-blocking the CO, where the liberated oxygen forms water, which then freezes\nout quickly. Therefore, the C/O ratio in the gas phase is found to gradually\nincrease with time, in a region bracketed by the water and CO ice-lines. In\nthis regions, C/O is found to approach unity after about 5 Myrs, scaling with\nthe cosmic ray ionisation rate.

I. $T(\\tau)$-Relations Abstract: Relations between temperature, T, and optical depth, tau, are often used for\ndescribing the photospheric transition from optically thick to optically thin\nin stellar structure models. We show that this is well justified, but also that\ncurrently used T(tau) relations are often inconsistent with their\nimplementation. As an outer boundary condition on the system of stellar\nstructure equations, T(tau) relations have an undue effect on the overall\nstructure of stars. In this age of precision asteroseismology, we need to\nre-assess both the method for computing and for implementing T(tau) relations,\nand the assumptions they rest on. We develop a formulation for proper and\nconsistent evaluation of T(tau) relations from arbitrary 1D or 3D stellar\natmospheres, and for their implementation in stellar structure and evolution\nmodels. We extract radiative T(tau) relations, as described by our new\nformulation, from 3D simulations of convection in deep stellar atmospheres of\nlate-type stars from dwarfs to giants. These simulations employ realistic\nopacities and equation of state, and account for line-blanketing. For\ncomparison, we also extract T(tau) relations from 1D MARCS model atmospheres\nusing the same formulation. T(tau)-relations from our grid of 3D convection\nsimulations display a larger range of behaviours with surface gravity, compared\nwith those of conventional theoretical 1D hydrostatic atmosphere models. Based\non this, we recommend no longer to use scaled solar T(tau) relations.

On time scales from days to\nyears, substantial changes occur in emission line profiles and line strengths.\nOur extensive time-domain spectroscopy suggests that the broad near-IR,\noptical, and far-uv emission lines, centered on the star, originate in a\nturbulent post-shock region and can undergo scattering by the overlying stellar\nwind as well as some absorption from infalling material. Stable absorption\nfeatures appear in H-alpha, apparently caused by an accreting column\nsilhouetted in the stellar wind. Inflow of material onto the star is revealed\nby the near-IR He I 10830A line, and its free-fall velocity correlates\ninversely with the strength of the post-shock emission, consistent with a\ndipole accretion model.

Profumo Abstract: We revisit the X-ray spectrum of the central 14' of the Andromeda galaxy,\ndiscussed in our previous work [1402.4119]. Recently in [1408.1699] it was\nclaimed that if one limits the analysis of the data to the interval 3-4 keV,\nthe significance of the detection of the line at 3.53 keV drops below 2 sigma.\nIn this note we show that such a restriction is not justified, as the continuum\nis well-modeled as a power law up to 8 keV, and parameters of the background\nmodel are well constrained over this larger interval of energies. This allows\nfor a detection of the line at 3.53 keV with a statistical significance greater\nthan ~3 sigma and for the identification of several known atomic lines in the\nenergy range 3-4 keV. Limiting the analysis to the 3-4 keV interval results in\nincreased uncertainty, thus decreasing the significance of the detection.

Using previously published lithium abundances, we remove the\nconfounding effect of the different fundamental stellar parameters by applying\na multivariable regression on our dataset. In doing so, we explicitly make an\nassumption made implicitly by different authors: that lithium abundance depends\nlinearly on fundamental stellar parameters.

Our analysis shows that under the above-mentioned assumption of\nlinearity, a statistically significant negative offset in lithium abundance\nbetween planet hosts and non-hosts is recovered.

The color selection can effectively isolate quasars at z~6\nfrom M/L/T dwarfs without the J-band photometry down to z_R<24.0, which is 3.5\nmag. deeper than SDSS. We have selected 17 promising quasar candidates. The\nfollow-up spectroscopy for seven targets identified one apparent quasar at\nz=6.156 with M_1450=-23.10.

Fixing that parameter leads to a disagreement between the\npredicted and observed rotation curves for a few galaxies. When cosmologically\nmotivated NFW dark matter halos are assumed, the rotation curves for the least\nmassive galaxies can, by no means, be reproduced; cores are definitively\npreferred over cusps. Finally, decompositions have been made for a pseudo\nisothermal halo combined with a universal M/L ratio. For the latter, the light\nof each galactic disc and bulge has been corrected for extinction and has been\nscaled by the effect of stellar population. This scheme can successfully\nexplain the observed rotations and leads to sub maximum disc mass\ncontributions. Properties of the resulting dark matter halos are described and\na ratio between dark and baryonic mass of approximately 9 for the least, and of\napproximately 5, for the most luminous galaxies has been determined, at the\noutermost measured rotation. \n\n"}

The standard theory involves the expulsion of undesirable flux\nand, because of flux freezing, the mass anchored on this flux also must be\nexpelled. The strong galactic gravitational field makes this impossible on\nenergetic grounds. It is shown that if only short pieces of the undesirable\nfield lines are expelled, then mass can flow down along these field lines\nwithout requiring much energy.

In agreement with our previous studies, we find that cores of\nhigher initial mass and angular momentum produce disks that are more favorable\nto gravitational instability and fragmentation, while a higher background\nirradiation and magnetic fields moderate the disk tendency to fragment. The\nprotostellar accretion in our models is time-variable, thanks to the nonlinear\ninteraction between different spiral modes in the gravitationally unstable\ndisk, and can undergo episodic bursts when fragments migrate onto the star\nowing to the gravitational interaction with other fragments or spiral arms.\nMost bursts occur in the partly embedded Class I phase, with a smaller fraction\ntaking place in the deeply embedded Class 0 phase and a few possible bursts in\nthe optically visible Class II phase.

Indeed, considering the low\ntemperatures, molecular clouds should be highly gravitationally unstable and\ncollapse on their global mean freefall timescale. And yet, they are observed to\nlive about 10-100 times longer, i.e., the SFR per freefall time (SFR_ff) is\nonly a few percent. Thus, other physical mechanisms must counteract the quick\nglobal collapse. Turbulence, magnetic fields and stellar feedback have been\nproposed as regulating agents, but it is still unclear which of these processes\nis the most important and what their relative contributions are. Here we run\nhigh-resolution simulations including gravity, turbulence, magnetic fields, and\njet/outflow feedback.

We aim to find\nbinary-evolution mechanisms that can explain these eccentric long-period\norbits, and reproduce the currently observed period-eccentricity diagram. Three\ndifferent processes are considered; tidally-enhanced wind mass-loss,\nphase-dependent RLOF on eccentric orbits and the interaction between a\ncircumbinary disk and the binary. The binary module of the stellar-evolution\ncode MESA (Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics) is extended to\ninclude the eccentricity-pumping processes. The effects of different input\nparameters on the final period and eccentricity of a binary-evolution model are\ntested with MESA. The end products of models with only tidally-enhanced wind\nmass-loss can indeed be eccentric, but these models need to lose too much mass,\nand invariably end up with a helium white dwarf that is too light to ignite\nhelium. Within the tested parameter space, no sdBs in eccentric systems are\nformed. Phase-dependent RLOF can reintroduce eccentricity during RLOF, and\ncould help to populate the short-period part of the period-eccentricity\ndiagram. When phase-dependent RLOF is combined with eccentricity pumping via a\ncircumbinary disk, the higher eccentricities can be reached as well. A\nremaining problem is that these models favour a distribution of higher\neccentricities at lower periods, while the observed systems show the opposite.\nThe models presented here are potentially capable of explaining the\nperiod-eccentricity distribution of long-period sdB binaries, but further\ntheoretical work on the physical mechanisms is necessary. \n\n"}

Within this\nscheme, the angular parameter which defines quasi-elliptical isophotes is\ntransformed from the commonly used, but inappropriate, polar co-ordinate to the\n`eccentric anomaly'. This provides a superior description of deviations from\nellipticity, better capturing the true isophotal shape. Furthermore, this makes\nit possible to accurately recover both the surface brightness profile, using\nthe correct azimuthally-averaged isophote, and the two-dimensional model of any\ngalaxy: the hitherto ubiquitous, but artificial, cross-like features in\nresidual images are completely removed. The formalism has been implemented into\nthe IRAF tasks $Ellipse$ and $Bmodel$ to create the new tasks `$Isofit$', and\n`$Cmodel$'. The new tools are demonstrated here with application to five\ngalaxies, chosen to be representative case-studies for several areas where this\ntechnique makes it possible to gain new scientific insight. Specifically:\nproperly quantifying boxy/disky isophotes via the fourth harmonic order in\nedge-on galaxies, quantifying X-shaped/peanut bulges, higher-order Fourier\nmoments for modelling bars in disks, and complex isophote shapes. Higher order\n(n > 4) harmonics now become meaningful and may correlate with structural\nproperties, as boxyness/diskyness is known to do.

However, only hints of\ncycle-to-cycle variations were found, without any strict periodicity. In this\ncontext the potential of the CoRoT exoplanetary data base was not fully\nexploited despite the wide area covered on the Galactic plane. Therefore, we\ninvestigated all the candidate Cepheids pointed out by the automatic\nclassification of the CoRoT curves. At the end we could identify seven\nbona-fide Cepheids. The light curves were investigated to remove some\ninstrumental effects. The frequency analysis was particularly delicate since\nthese small effects can be enhanced by the large amplitude, resulting in the\npresence of significant, but spurious, peaks in the power spectrum. Indeed, the\ncareful evaluation of a very attracting peak in the spectra of CoRoT\n0102618121, allowed us to certify its spurious origin.

We present here a new code, DAMOCLES, that models the effects of dust\non the line profiles of core-collapse supernovae in order to determine the\nmasses of newly formed dust. As noted by Lucy et al.

We find that dust-affected line profiles need not necessarily be\nflux-biased towards to the blue, although the profile peak will always be\nblue-shifted. We have collated optical spectra of SN 1987A from a variety of\narchival sources and have modelled the evolution of the H$\\alpha$ line from\ndays 714 to 3604, as well as that of the [OI] 6300,6363A doublet between days\n714 and 1478. A variety of evidence points to the presence of clumping and we\nfind that our clumped dust models require significantly higher dust masses than\nsmoothly distributed dust models. Our line profile fits imply day 714 dust\nmasses of <3 $\\times$ 10$^{-3}$ M$_{\\odot}$ for all grain types apart from very\nhigh albedo pure magnesium silicates, for which up to 0.07M$_{\\odot}$ can be\naccommodated.

These facts may lead people to believe that\ngravitational theories with long-ranged scalar fields have already been\nconstrained strongly from binary pulsar observations. Here we challenge this\n\"lore\" by investigating the decoupling limit of Gauss-Bonnet gravity as an\nexample, in which the scalar field couples linearly to the Gauss-Bonnet density\nin the action. We prove a theorem that neutron stars in this theory cannot\npossess a scalar charge. Thus Gauss-Bonnet gravity evades the strong binary\npulsar constraints on dipole radiation. We discuss the astrophysical systems\nyielding the best constraints on Gauss-Bonnet gravity and related quadratic\ngravity theories.

In generic case,\neither neutron star-binary or neutron star-black hole systems can be used to\nconstrain the theory, but Gauss-Bonnet gravity evades the neutron star-binary\nconstraints.

A spectrum of curvature radiation ramps up until the rapid\ninjection of energy ignites a fireball, which would appear as an energetic\nblackbody peaking in the x ray to $\\gamma$ rays for neutron star field\nstrengths ranging from $10^{12}$G to $10^{16}$G respectively and a $10M_{\\odot}\n$ black hole.

On\n  Calcium II Triplet Based Metallicities of Globular Clusters in Early-type\n  Galaxies Abstract: The metallicity distribution function of globular clusters (GCs) in galaxies\nis a key to understanding galactic formation and evolution. The calcium II\ntriplet (CaT) index has recently become a popular metal abundance indicator\nthanks to its sensitivity to GC metallicity. Here we revisit and assess the\nreliability of CaT as a metallicity indicator using our new stellar population\nsynthesis simulations based on empirical, high-resolution fluxes. The model\nshows that the CaT strength of old ($>$ 10 Gyr) GCs is proportional to ${\\rm\n[Fe/H]}$ below $-0.5$. In the modest metal-rich regime, however, CaT does not\nincrease anymore with ${\\rm [Fe/H]}$ due to the little contribution from\ncoolest red giant stars to the CaT absorption. The nonlinear nature of the\ncolor--$CaT$ relation is confirmed by the observations of GCs in nearby\nearly-type galaxies. This indicates that the CaT should be used carefully when\nderiving metallicities of metal-rich stellar populations. Our results offer an\nexplanation for the observed sharp difference between the color and $CaT$\ndistributions of GCs in the same galaxies. We take this as an analogy to the\nview that metallicity--color and metallicity--Lick index nonlinearity of GCs is\nprimarily responsible for their observed \"bimodal\" distributions of colors and\nabsorption indices. \n\n"}

Our aim is to determine the frequency and orbital parameters of\nbinary systems among the CEMP-s stars, which exhibit strong enhancements of\nneutron-capture elements associated with the s-process. This allows us to test\nwhether local mass transfer from a binary companion is necessary and sufficient\nto explain their dramatic carbon excesses. Eighteen of the 22 stars exhibit\nclear orbital motion, yielding a binary frequency of 82+-10%, while four stars\nappear to be single (18+-10%). We thus confirm that the binary frequency of\nCEMP-s stars is much higher than for normal metal-poor giants, but not 100% as\npreviously claimed. Secure orbits are determined for 11 of the binaries and\nprovisional orbits for six long-period systems (P > 3,000 days), and orbital\ncircularisation time scales are discussed. The conventional scenario of local\nmass transfer from a former AGB binary companion does appear to account for the\nchemical composition of most CEMP-s stars. However, the excess of C and\ns-process elements in some single CEMP-s stars was apparently transferred to\ntheir natal clouds by an external (distant) source.

This quantity depends of the resolution of\nthe N-body simulation, leading to a divergent fraction of quenched satellites\nin high- and low-resolution simulations.

We study the solar-analog star HD 45184.\nMethods. We analyse the activity signatures of HD 45184 by using 291 HARPS\nspectra obtained between 2003 and 2014. In order to search for line-core fluxes\nvariations, we focus on Ca II H&K and Balmer H$\\alpha$, H$\\beta$ lines, which\nare usually used as optical chromospheric activity indicators. We calculate the\nHARPS-S index from Ca II H&K lines and convert it to the Mount-Wilson scale. In\naddition, we also consider as activity indicators the equivalent widths of\nBalmer lines. Moreover, we analyse the possible variability of Fe II and other\nmetallic lines in the optical spectra. Results. We report for the first time a\nlong-term 5.14-yr activity cycle in the solar-analog star HD 45184. This makes\nHD 45184 one of most similar stars to the Sun with known activity cycle. Such\nvariation is also evident in the first lines of the Balmer series, which not\nalways show a correlation with activity in solar-type stars. Notably, unlike\nthe solar case, we also found that the equivalent widths of the high\nphotospheric Fe II lines (4924 \\AA, 5018 {\\AA} and 5169 \\AA) are modulated\n($\\pm$ 2 m\\AA) by the chromospheric cycle of the star. From short-term\nmodulation of the S index we calculate a rotational period of 19.98 days, which\nagrees with its mean chromospheric activity level. \n\n"}

By that time the supersoft source phase had already\nended and Chandra spectra are consistent with emission from a hot, shock-heated\ncircumstellar medium with temperatures exceeding 10^7K.

Single-lined objects Abstract: We present results of our spectroscopic observations of nine detached\neclipsing binaries (DEBs), selected from the $Kepler$ Eclipsing Binary Catalog,\nthat only show one set of spectral lines. Radial velocities (RVs) were\ncalculated from the high resolution spectra obtained with the HIDES instrument,\nattached to the 1.88-m telescope at the Okayama Astrophysical Observatory, and\nfrom the public APOGEE archive. In our sample we found five single-lined\nbinaries, with one component dominating the spectrum. The orbital and light\ncurve solutions were found for four of them, and compared with isochrones, in\norder to estimate absolute physical parameters and evolutionary status of the\ncomponents. For the fifth case we only update the orbital parameters, and\nestimate the properties of the unseen star. Two other systems show orbital\nmotion with a period known from the eclipse timing variations (ETVs). For these\nwe obtained parameters of outer orbits, by translating the ETVs to RVs of the\ncentre of mass of the eclipsing binary, and combining with the RVs of the outer\nstar. Of the two remaining ones, one is most likely a blend of a faint\nbackground DEB with a bright foreground star, which lines we see in the\nspectra, and the last case is possibly a quadruple bearing a sub-stellar mass\nobject.

Galaxies were therein\nseparated from stars and quasars through colour cuts, which may leave\nimperfections because of mixing different source types which overlap in colour\nspace.

For the automatised classification we use the support vector\nmachines learning algorithm, employing SDSS spectroscopic sources cross-matched\nwith WISExSuperCOSMOS as the training and verification set. We perform a number\nof tests to examine the behaviour of the classifier (completeness, purity and\naccuracy) as a function of source apparent magnitude and Galactic latitude. We\nthen apply the classifier to the full-sky data and analyse the resulting\ncatalogue of candidate galaxies. We also compare thus produced dataset with the\none presented in B16.

Determining gas\nand dust mass-loss rates (MLRs) is important in quantifying the contribution of\nevolved stars to the enrichment of the interstellar medium. Aims: Attempt to,\nfor the first time, spectrally resolve CO thermal line emission in a small\nsample of AGB stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Methods: ALMA was used to\nobserve 2 OH/IR stars and 4 carbon stars in the LMC in the CO J= 2-1 line.\nResults: We present the first measurement of expansion velocities in\nextragalactic carbon stars. All four C-stars are detected and wind expansion\nvelocities and stellar velocities are directly measured. Mass-loss rates are\nderived from modelling the spectral energy distribution and Spitzer/IRS\nspectrum with the DUSTY code. Gas-to-dust ratios are derived that make the\npredicted velocities agree with the observed ones. The expansion velocities and\nMLRs are compared to a Galactic sample of well-studied relatively low MLRs\nstars supplemented with \"extreme\" C-stars that have properties more similar to\nthe LMC targets. Gas MLRs derived from a simple formula are significantly\nsmaller than derived from the dust modelling, indicating an order of magnitude\nunderestimate of the estimated CO abundance, time-variable mass loss, or that\nthe CO intensities in LMC stars are lower than predicted by the formula derived\nfor Galactic objects. This could be related to a stronger interstellar\nradiation field in the LMC. Conclusions: Although the LMC sample is small and\nthe comparison to Galactic stars is non-trivial because of uncertainties in\ntheir distances it appears that for C stars the wind expansion velocities in\nthe LMC are lower than in the solar neighbourhood, while the MLRs appear\nsimilar. This is in agreement with dynamical dust-driven wind models. \n\n"}

These\nelementary particles play a crucial role when the evolution of a massive star\nis terminated by the collapse of its core to a neutron star or a black hole and\nthe star explodes as supernova. The release of electron neutrinos, which are\nabundantly produced by electron captures, accelerates the catastrophic infall\nand causes a gradual neutronization of the stellar plasma by converting protons\nto neutrons as dominant constituents of neutron star matter. The emission of\nneutrinos and antineutrinos of all flavors carries away the gravitational\nbinding energy of the compact remnant and drives its evolution from the hot\ninitial to the cold final state. The absorption of electron neutrinos and\nantineutrinos in the surroundings of the newly formed neutron star can power\nthe supernova explosion and determines the conditions in the innermost\nsupernova ejecta, making them an interesting site for the nucleosynthesis of\niron-group elements and trans-iron nuclei.

We do this by developing an algorithm that [1] automatically\ngenerates features in 5.5 TB of image data taken by the Solar Dynamics\nObservatory of the solar photosphere, chromosphere, transition region, and\ncorona during the time period between May 2010 and May 2014, [2] combines these\nfeatures with other features based on flaring history and a physical\nunderstanding of putative flaring processes, and [3] classifies these features\nto predict whether a solar active region will flare within a time period of $T$\nhours, where $T$ = 2 and 24. We find that when optimizing for the True Skill\nScore (TSS), photospheric vector magnetic field data combined with flaring\nhistory yields the best performance, and when optimizing for the area under the\nprecision-recall curve, all the data are helpful. Our model performance yields\na TSS of $0.84 \\pm 0.03$ and $0.81 \\pm 0.03$ in the $T$ = 2 and 24 hour cases,\nrespectively, and a value of $0.13 \\pm 0.07$ and $0.43 \\pm 0.08$ for the area\nunder the precision-recall curve in the $T$ = 2 and 24 hour cases,\nrespectively.

This paper places constraints\non progenitor initial mass and metallicity in distinct core-collapse SN\nsubclasses, through a study of the parent stellar populations at the explosion\nsites. Integral field spectroscopy (IFS) of 83 nearby SN explosion sites with a\nmedian distance of 18 Mpc has been collected and analysed, enabling detection\nand spectral extraction of the parent stellar population of SN progenitors.\nFrom the parent stellar population spectrum, the initial mass and metallicity\nof the coeval progenitor are derived by means of comparison to simple stellar\npopulation models and strong-line methods. Additionally, near-infrared IFS was\nemployed to characterise the star formation history at the explosion sites. No\nsignificant metallicity differences are observed among distinct SN types. The\ntypical progenitor mass is found to be highest for SN Ic, followed by type Ib,\nthen types IIb and II.

Going beyond\nprevious work we now allow the spectrum to have arbitrary scale-dependence. Our\nnon-parametric reconstruction then suggests several spectral features, the most\nprominent at k ~ 0.006/Mpc. When a constant quadrupolar modulation is fitted to\ndata in the range 0.005 < k Mpc < 0.008, its preferred directions are found to\nbe related to the cosmic hemispherical asymmetry and the CMB dipole. To\ndetermine the significance we apply two test statistics to our reconstructions\nof the quadrupolar modulation from data, against reconstructions of\nrealisations of noise only.

Structure of the Inner Disk as Implied\n  by the MRI Abstract: The large population of Earth to super-Earth sized planets found very close\nto their host stars has motivated consideration of $in$ $situ$ formation\nmodels. In particular, Inside-Out Planet Formation is a scenario in which\nplanets coalesce sequentially in the disk, at the local gas pressure maximum\nnear the inner boundary of the dead zone. The pressure maximum arises from a\ndecline in viscosity, going from the active innermost disk (where thermal\nionization of alkalis yields high viscosities via the magneto-rotational\ninstability (MRI)) to the adjacent dead zone (where the MRI is quenched).\nPrevious studies of the pressure maximum, based on $\\alpha$-disk models, have\nassumed ad hoc values for the viscosity parameter $\\alpha$ in the active zone,\nignoring the detailed physics of the MRI. Here we explicitly couple the MRI\ncriteria to the $\\alpha$-disk equations, to find steady-state (constant\naccretion rate) solutions for the disk structure. We consider the effects of\nboth Ohmic and ambipolar resistivities, and find solutions for a range of disk\naccretion rates ($\\dot{M}$ = $10^{-10}$ - $10^{-8}$ ${\\rm M}_{\\odot}$/yr),\nstellar masses ($M_{\\ast}$ = 0.1 - 1 ${\\rm M}_{\\odot}$), and fiducial values of\nthe $non$-MRI $\\alpha$-viscosity in the dead zone ($\\alpha_{\\rm {DZ}} =\n10^{-5}$ - $10^{-3}$).

In this work we reduce this degeneracy by\ncombining weak lensing together with strong lensing and stellar kinematics. Our\nanalysis is based on two galaxy samples: 45 strong lenses from the SLACS survey\nand 1,700 massive quiescent galaxies from the SDSS main spectroscopic sample\nwith weak lensing measurements from the Hyper Suprime-Cam survey. We use a\nBayesian hierarchical approach to jointly model all three observables.

Abstract: In the present paper, we model the wind of solar analogues at different ages\nto investigate the evolution of the solar wind. Recently, it has been suggested\nthat winds of solar type stars might undergo a change in properties at old\nages, whereby stars older than the Sun would be less efficient in carrying away\nangular momentum than what was traditionally believed. Adding to this, recent\nobservations suggest that old solar-type stars show a break in coronal\nproperties, with a steeper decay in X-ray luminosities and temperatures at\nolder ages. We use these X-ray observations to constrain the thermal\nacceleration of winds of solar analogues. Our sample is based on the stars from\nthe `Sun in time' project with ages between 120-7000 Myr. The break in X-ray\nproperties leads to a break in wind mass-loss rates ($\\dot{M}$) at roughly 2\nGyr, with $\\dot{M}$ (t < 2 Gyr) $\\propto t^{-0.74}$ and $\\dot{M}$ (t > 2 Gyr)\n$\\propto$ $t^{-3.9}$. This steep decay in $\\dot{M}$ at older ages could be the\nreason why older stars are less efficient at carrying away angular momentum,\nwhich would explain the anomalously rapid rotation observed in older stars. We\nalso show that none of the stars in our sample would have winds dense enough to\nproduce thermal emission above 1-2 GHz, explaining why their radio emissions\nhave not yet been detected. Combining our models with dynamo evolution models\nfor the magnetic field of the Earth we find that, at early ages ($\\approx$100\nMyr) our Earth had a magnetosphere that was 3 or more times smaller than its\ncurrent size. \n\n"}

The\nr'- and K_s-band light curves show rectangular, flat-bottomed dips, similar to\nthe X-ray mode-switching (active-passive state transitions) behaviour observed\npreviously. The cross-correlation function (CCF) of the optical and near-IR\ndata reveals a strong, broad negative anti-correlation at negative lags, a\nbroad positive correlation at positive lags, with a strong, positive narrow\ncorrelation superimposed. The shape of the CCF resembles the CCF of black hole\nX-ray binaries but the time-scales are different. The features can be explained\nby reprocessing and a hot accretion flow close to the neutron star's\nmagnetospheric radius. The optical emission is dominated by the reprocessed\ncomponent, whereas the near-IR emission contains the emission from plasmoids in\nthe hot accretion flow and a reprocessed component. The rapid active-passive\nstate transition occurs when the hot accretion flow material is channelled onto\nthe neutron star and is expelled from its magnetosphere. During the transition\nthe optical reprocessing component decreases resulting in the removal of a blue\nspectral component. The accretion of clumpy material through the magnetic\nbarrier of the neutron star produces the observed near-IR/optical CCF and\nvariability. The dip at negative lags corresponds to the suppression of the\nnear-IR synchrotron component in the hot flow, whereas the broad positive\ncorrelation at positive lags is driven by the increased synchrotron emission of\nthe outflowing plasmoids. The narrow peak in the CCF is due to the delayed\nreprocessed component, enhanced by the increased X-ray emission. \n\n"}

Age-dating these galaxies\nis, however, a difficult task, and even a small contribution of an underlying\nyoung stellar population could, in principle, affect the age estimate and its\ncosmological interpretation. We present several spectral indicators to detect,\nquantify and constrain such contamination in old galaxies, and study how their\ncombination can be used to maximize the purity of cosmic chronometers\nselection. In particular, we analyze the CaII H/K ratio, the presence (or\nabsence) of H$\\alpha$ and [OII] emission lines, higher order Balmer absorption\nlines, and UV flux; each indicator is especially sensitive to a particular age\nrange, allowing us to detect young components ranging between 10 Myr and 1 Gyr.\nThe combination of these indicators minimizes the contamination to a level\nbelow 1% in the case of ideal data.

The cloud's evolution is characterized by an initial increase in\nits mass, density, and star formation rate (SFR) and efficiency (SFE) as it\ncontracts, followed by a decrease of these quantities as newly formed massive\nstars begin to disrupt the cloud. The main parameter of the model is the\nmaximum mass reached by the cloud during its evolution. Thus, specifying the\ninstantaneous mass and some other variable completely determines the cloud's\nevolutionary stage. We apply the model to interpret the observed scatter in\nSFEs of the cloud sample compiled by Lada et al.\\ as an evolutionary effect so\nthat, although clouds such as California and Orion A have similar masses, they\nare in very different evolutionary stages, causing their very different\nobserved SFRs and SFEs. The model predicts that the California cloud will\neventually reach a significantly larger total mass than the Orion A cloud.\nNext, we apply the model to derive estimated ages of the clouds since the time\nwhen approximately 25\\% of their mass had become molecular. We find ages from\n$\\sim 1.5$ to 27 Myr, with the most inactive clouds being the youngest. Further\npredictions of the model are that clouds with very low SFEs should have massive\natomic envelopes constituting the majority of their gravitational mass, and\nthat low-mass clouds ($M \\sim 10^3$-$10^4 \\, M_\\odot$) end their lives with a\nmini-burst of star formation, reaching SFRs $\\sim 300$-$500\\, M_\\odot$\nMyr$^{-1}$.

Although several plausible mechanisms for this elevated\nvelocity dispersion (e.g. star formation feedback, elevated gas supply, or more\nfrequent galaxy interactions) have been proposed, the fundamental driver of the\nvelocity dispersion enhancement at high redshift remains unclear. We\ninvestigate the origin of this kinematic evolution using a suite of\ncosmological simulations from the FIRE (Feedback In Realistic Environments)\nproject. Although IFS surveys generally cover a wider range of stellar masses\nthan in these simulations, the simulated galaxies show trends between intrinsic\nvelocity dispersion, SFR, and redshift in agreement with observations. In both\nthe observed and simulated galaxies, intrinsic velocity dispersion is\npositively correlated with SFR. Intrinsic velocity dispersion increases with\nredshift out to z~1 and then flattens beyond that.

We find that the lifetime\nof the ring correlates with the initial impact velocity vertical to the disk\nplane (i.e., $v_{z0}$). Three orbits for the collisional galaxy pair, on which\nclear and asymmetric rings form after collisions, are selected to perform the\n\\textit{N}-body simulations at different values of $B/D$ for the progenitor. It\nis found that the ring structures are the strongest for the CRGs with small\nvalues of $B/D$. The S\\'{e}rsic index, $n$, of the central remnant in the\ntarget galaxy becomes larger after collision. Moreover, the S\\'{e}rsic index of\na central remnant strongly correlates with the initial value of $B/D$ for the\nprogenitor. A bulge-less progenitor results in a late-type object in the center\nof the ring galaxy, whereas a bulge-dominated progenitor leads to an early-type\ncentral remnant.

We show that this assumption is incorrect when the energy is injected\nin the form of energetic (i.e. energy much greater than the background CMB\ntemperature) particles. We evolve the electromagnetic cascades, from the\ninjection of high energy particles, in the expanding Universe and follow the\nnon-thermal component of CMB spectral distortions resulting from the\ninteraction of the electromagnetic shower with the background photons,\nelectrons, and ions. The electromagnetic shower loses a substantial fraction of\nits energy to the CMB spectral distortions before the energy of the particles\nin the shower has degraded to low enough energies that they can thermalize with\nthe background plasma. This spectral distortion is the result of the\ninteraction of non-thermal energetic electrons in the shower with the CMB and\nthus has a shape that is substantially different from the $y$-type or $i$-type\ndistortions. The shape of the final \\emph{non-thermal relativistic}\n($ntr$-type) CMB spectral distortion depends upon the initial energy spectrum\nof the injected electrons, positrons, and photons and thus has information\nabout the energy injection mechanism e.g. the decay or annihilation channel of\nthe decaying or annihilating dark matter particles.

Two distinct components of dust in IC 4329A are\nfound. One component is in the interstellar medium (ISM) of the host galaxy,\nand the other is a nuclear component in the AGN torus and its associated wind.\nThe emitting dust in the torus is evident in mid-IR emission (9.7 and 18 micron\nfeatures), while dust in the wind is present through both reddening and X-ray\nabsorption (O, Si, and Fe edge features). The gas depletion factors into dust\nfor O, Si, and Fe are measured. We derive an intrinsic reddening E(B-V) ~ 1.0,\nwhich is most consistent with a grey (flat) extinction law.

It is shown that damping term of polarized Compton\nscattering in the presence of scalar perturbation can generate circular\npolarization in CMB radiation, so that the power spectrum of circular\npolarization of CMB $C_l^{V(S)}$ is proportional to the power spectrum of\ntemperature anisotropy of CMB $C_l^{I(S)}$ and also $\\delta^2$ which is a\nfraction of polarized electron number density to the total one with net Left-\nor Right-handed polarizations. We have discussed that at least we need\n$\\delta<10^{-4}$ to find consistency with a reported upper limit of CMB\ncircular polarization. \n\n"}

Abstract: Only star clusters that are sufficiently compact and massive survive largely\nunharmed beyond 10 Myr. However, their compactness means a high stellar density\nwhich can lead to strong gravitational interactions between the stars. As young\nstars are often initially surrounded by protoplanetary disks and later on\npotentially by planetary systems, the question arises to what degree these\nstrong gravitational interactions influence planet formation and the properties\nof planetary systems. Here, we perform simulations of the evolution of compact\nhigh-mass clusters like Trumpler 14 and Westerlund 2 from the embedded to the\ngas-free phase and study the influence of stellar interactions. We concentrate\non the development of the mean disk size in these environments. Our simulations\nshow that in high-mass open clusters $80-90\\%$ of all disks/planetary systems\nshould be smaller than 50 AU just due to the strong stellar interactions in\nthese environments. Already in the initial phases, 3-4 close fly-bys lead to\ntypical disk sizes within the range of 18-27 AU. Afterwards, the disk sizes are\naltered only to a small extent.

This enables us to calculate the fraction of\nUCDs that host SMBHs across their entire luminosity range for the first time.\nWe then apply the SMBH occupation fraction to the observed luminosity function\nof UCDs and estimate that in the Fornax and Virgo cluster alone there should be\n$69^{+32}_{-25}$ stripped nuclei with SMBHs.

An assessment of\nLISA detection prospects requires an estimate of the abundance and properties\nof MBHBs that form and evolve during the assembly of cosmic structures. To this\naim, we employ a semi-analytic model to follow the co-evolution of MBHBs within\ntheir host galaxies. We identify three major evolutionary channels driving the\nbinaries to coalescence: two standard paths along which the binary evolution is\ndriven by interactions with the stellar and/or gaseous environment, and a novel\nchannel where MBHB coalescence occurs during the interaction with a third black\nhole. For each channel, we follow the orbital evolution of MBHBs with\nphysically motivated models that include a self-consistent treatment of the\norbital eccentricity. We find that LISA will detect between $\\approx 25$ and\n$\\approx 75$ events per year depending on the seed model.

Remarkably, triple interactions among the black holes can\nproduce coalescing binaries with large eccentricities ($\\gtrsim 0.9$) upon\nentrance into the LISA band.

Rotation is suspected to be the cause of\nthis feature, by accumulating fast rotating stars, strongly affected by gravity\ndarkening and rotation-induced mixing, near the MS turn-off. This scenario\nsuccessfully reproduces the tight relation between the age and the actual\nextent in luminosity of the extended MS turn-off of observed clusters. Below a\ngiven mass (dependent on the metallicity), stars are efficiently braked early\non the MS due to the interaction of stellar winds and the surface magnetic\nfield, making their tracks converge towards those of non-rotating tracks in the\nHRD. When these stars are located at the turn-off of a cluster, their slow\nrotation causes the extended MS turn-off feature to disappear. We investigate\nthe maximal mass for which this braking occurs at different metallicities, and\ndetermine the age above which no extended MS turn-off is expected in clusters.\nOur models predict that the extended MS turn-off phenomenon disappears at ages\nolder than about 2 Gyr.

In\ncases where a brown dwarf is found as a directly imaged companion to a star, as\nin HD 4747 and HD 19467, the mass, age, and luminosity of the brown dwarf are\ndetermined independently, making them ideal objects to use to benchmark SSEMs.\nUsing the Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy Array, we measured the\nangular diameters and calculated the radii of the host stars HD 4747 A and HD\n19467 A. After fitting their parameters to the Dartmouth Stellar Evolution\nDatabase, MESA Isochrones and Stellar Tracks, and Yonsei-Yale isochronal\nmodels, we adopt age estimates of $10.74^{+6.75}_{-6.87}$ Gyr for HD 4747 A and\n$10.06^{+1.16}_{-0.82}$ Gyr for HD 19467 A.

We present the\nfirst CO detection in a planetesimal belt around an M star, TWA 7. The\noptically thin CO (J=3-2) emission is co-located with previously identified\ndust emission from the belt, and the emission velocity structure is consistent\nwith Keplerian rotation around the central star. The detected CO is not well\nshielded against photodissociation, and must thus be continuously replenished\nby gas release from exocomets within the belt.

More luminous stars will therefore on average host more\nmassive (and hence more easily detectable) exocometary CO disks, leading to the\nhigher detection rates observed.

We derived accurate stellar ages for the cluster NGC6530,\nassociated with the Lagoon Nebula to infer its SF history. We use the Gaia-ESO\nsurvey observations and Gaia DR2 data, to derive cluster membership and\nfundamental stellar parameters. We identified 652 confirmed and 9 probable\nmembers. The reddening inferred for members and non-members allows us to\ndistinguish MS stars and giants, in agreement with the distances inferred from\nGaia DR2 data. The foreground and background stars show a spatial pattern that\ntraces the 3D structure of the nebular dust component. We derive stellar ages\nfor 382 confirmed cluster members and we find that the gravity-sensitive gamma\nindex distribution for M stars is correlated with stellar age. For all members\nwith Teff<5500 K, the mean logarithmic age is 5.84 (units of years) with a\ndispersion of 0.36 dex. The age distribution of stars with accretion and/or\ndisk (CTTSe) is similar to that of stars without accretion and without disk\n(WTTSp). We interpret this dispersion as evidence of a real age spread since\nthe total uncertainties on age determinations, derived from Monte Carlo\nsimulations, are significantly smaller than the observed spread. This\nconclusion is supported by the evidence of a decreasing of the\ngravity-sensitive gamma index as a function of stellar ages. The presence of\nthe age spread is also supported by the spatial distribution and the kinematics\nof old and young members. In particular, members with accretion and/or disk,\nformed in the last 1 Myr, show evidence of subclustering around the cluster\ncenter, in the Hourglass Nebula and in the M8-E region, suggesting a possible\ntriggering of star formation events by the O-type star ionization fronts. \n\n"}

This issue is of particular\ninterest at the present time since most of the observed multiple lens systems\nhave magnification ratios and image geometries that are not well-fit by\nstandard mass models. The presence of substructure exterior to the lens has\nbeen invoked by several authors in the context of Cold Dark Matter (CDM) models\nin order to explain the anamolous magnification ratios. We emphasize that the\nanomalous magnification ratios may be an artifact of the simple one-component\nmass models currently in use; the inclusion of a misaligned disk may be able to\nmimic the effect of substructure. These slight spatial offsets between the dark\nmatter halo and the disk, which are likely to occur during or as a consequence\nof interactions or mergers, lead to complex image configurations and\nnon-standard magnification ratios. We investigate two illustrative lens models:\na spiral disk embedded within a dark matter halo, and a compact disk-like\ncomponent within an elliptical galaxy.

In such cases we find\nthat the resultant lensing geometries are unusual, with high image\nmultiplicities.

We solve the\nradial momentum equation for solutions corresponding to an accretion flow that\nstarts from a subsonic state at infinity, smoothly passes the fast critical\npoint, then supersonically falls into the horizon of the black hole. The\nsolutions always have the following features: 1) The specific energy of fluid\nparticles remains constant but the specific angular momentum is effectively\nremoved by the magnetic field. 2) At large radii, where the disk motion is\ndominantly rotational, the energy density of the magnetic field is\nequipartitioned with the rotational energy density of the disk. 3) Inside the\nfast critical point, where radial motion becomes important, the ratio of the\nelectromagnetic energy density to the kinetic energy density drops quickly. The\nresults indicate that: 1) Disk accretion does not necessarily imply energy\ndissipation since magnetic fields do not have to transport or dissipate a lot\nof energy as they effectively transport angular momentum. 2) When resistivity\nis small, the large-scale magnetic field is amplified by the shearing rotation\nof the disk until the magnetic energy density is equipartitioned with the\nrotational energy density, ending up with a geometrically thick disk. This is\nin contrast with the evolution of small-scale magnetic fields where if the\nresistivity is nonzero the magnetic energy density is likely to be\nequipartitioned with the kinetic energy density associated with local random\nmotions (e.g., turbulence), making a thin Keplerian disk possible. \n\n"}

The interpretation of an occultation light curve, unfortunately, is\naffected by a geometric degeneracy such that one is unable to determine the KBO\nsize independent of its distance. This degeneracy can be broken through a\nprecise measurement of the relative velocity obtained from simultaneous\nobservations of individual events. While an array of telescopes spread over an\narea of few square kilometers can be employed, it is unlikely that the relative\nvelocity can be measured to the required accuracy to help break this geometric\ndegeneracy. The presence of diffraction fringes in KBO occultation light\ncurves, when projected sizes of occulted stars are smaller than the Fresnel\nscale, improves determination of size and distance significantly.

Correcting for the luminosity evolution reduces\nthe orthogonal scatter in the Fundamental Plane to 8%, consistent with the\nlocal scatter. This scatter is measured for our sample, and does not include\nresults from other studies which may have different selection effects. The\ndifference in the degree of evolution between our field sample and published\ncluster galaxies suggests a more recent formation epoch--around z=1.5 for field\ngalaxies compared to z>2.0 for cluster galaxies.

It is an important question then whether this\ntype of selection reduces the projection effects prevalent in optically\nselected cluster samples. We address this question using simulated data, from\nwhich we construct synthetic cluster catalogues both with Abell's criterion and\nan aperture-mass estimator sensitive to gravitational tidal effects. The\nsignal-to-noise ratio of the latter allows to some degree to control the\nproperties of the cluster sample. For the first time, we apply the\ncluster-detection algorithm proposed by Schneider to large-scale structure\nsimulations.\n  We find that selection of clusters through weak gravitational lensing is more\nreliable in terms of completeness and spurious detections. Choosing the\nsignal-to-noise threshold appropriately, the completeness can be increased up\nto 100%, and the fraction of spurious detections can significantly be reduced\ncompared to Abell-selected cluster samples.\n  We also investigate the accuracy of mass estimates in cluster samples\nselected by both luminosity and weak-lensing effects. We find that mass\nestimates from gravitational lensing, for which we employ the zeta-statistics\nby Kaiser et al., are significantly more accurate than those obtained from\ngalaxy kinematics via the virial theorem. \n\n"}
{"id": "astro-ph/9904254", "contents": "Title: Is the cosmic microwave background really non-Gaussian? Abstract: Two recent papers have claimed detection of non-Gaussian features in the COBE\nDMR sky maps of the cosmic microwave background. We confirm these results, but\nargue that Gaussianity is still not convincingly ruled out. Since a score of\nnon-Gaussianity tests have now been published, one might expect some mildly\nsignificant results even by chance. Moreover, in the case of one measure which\nyields a detection, a bispectrum statistic, we find that if the non-Gaussian\nfeature is real, it may well be due to detector noise rather than a\nnon-Gaussian sky signal, since a signal-to-noise analysis localizes it to\nangular scales smaller than the beam. We study its spatial origin in case it is\nnonetheless due to a sky signal (eg, a cosmic string wake or flat-spectrum\nforeground contaminant). It appears highly localized in the direction b=39.5,\nl=257, since removing a mere 5 pixels inside a single COBE beam area centered\nthere makes the effect statistically insignificant. We also test Guassianity\nwith an eigenmode analysis which allows a sky map to be treated as a random\nnumber generator. A battery of tests of this generator all yield results\nconsistent with Gaussianity. \n\n"}
