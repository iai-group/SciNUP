Using the cavity method, we present a detailed and systematic analytical\nstudy of the space of proper colorings (solutions).\n  We show that for a fixed number of colors and as the average vertex degree\n(number of constraints) increases, the set of solutions undergoes several phase\ntransitions similar to those observed in the mean field theory of glasses.\nFirst, at the clustering transition, the entropically dominant part of the\nphase space decomposes into an exponential number of pure states so that beyond\nthis transition a uniform sampling of solutions becomes hard. Afterward, the\nspace of solutions condenses over a finite number of the largest states and\nconsequently the total entropy of solutions becomes smaller than the annealed\none. Another transition takes place when in all the entropically dominant\nstates a finite fraction of nodes freezes so that each of these nodes is\nallowed a single color in all the solutions inside the state. Eventually, above\nthe coloring threshold, no more solutions are available. We compute all the\ncritical connectivities for Erdos-Renyi and regular random graphs and determine\ntheir asymptotic values for large number of colors.\n  Finally, we discuss the algorithmic consequences of our findings. We argue\nthat the onset of computational hardness is not associated with the clustering\ntransition and we suggest instead that the freezing transition might be the\nrelevant phenomenon. We also discuss the performance of a simple local Walk-COL\nalgorithm and of the belief propagation algorithm in the light of our results. \n\n"}

BGP is the glue that holds\nthe Internet together and hence its stability, i.e. the equilibria of\nfractional BGP games (Haxell, Wilfong), is a matter of practical importance.\nBBC games (Laoutaris et al) follow in the tradition of the large body of work\non network formation games and capture a variety of applications ranging from\nsocial networks and overlay networks to peer-to-peer networks.\n  The central result of this paper is that there are no fully polynomial-time\napproximation schemes (unless PPAD is in FP) for computing equilibria in both\nfractional BGP games and fractional BBC games. We obtain this result by proving\nthe hardness for a new and surprisingly simple game, the fractional preference\ngame, which is reducible to both fractional BGP and BBC games.\n  We define a new flow-based notion of equilibrium for matrix games --\npersonalized equilibria -- generalizing both fractional BBC and fractional BGP\ngames. We prove not just the existence, but the existence of rational\npersonalized equilibria for all matrix games, which implies the existence of\nrational equilibria for fractional BGP and BBC games.

For example, such computation can be\nrealized by a concatenation of parameterized quantum circuits, with an\nadiabatic though inevitably discrete change of the parameter. A design\nprinciple of adiabatic passage along quasienergy is recently proposed: Cheon's\nquasienergy and eigenspace anholonomies on unitary operators is available to\nrealize anholonomic adiabatic algorithms [Tanaka and Miyamoto, Phys.

We show that these axioms enforce a unique\nconversion law between utility and probability (and thereby, information).\nMoreover, we show that this relation can be characterized as a variational\nprinciple: given a utility function, its conjugate probability measure\nmaximizes a free utility functional. Transformations of probability measures\ncan then be formalized as a change in free utility due to the addition of new\nconstraints expressed by a target utility function.

In contrast to the primary market, channels can be\nassigned to multiple bidders, provided that the corresponding devices are well\nseparated such that the interference is sufficiently low. Interference\nconflicts are described in terms of a conflict graph in which the nodes\nrepresent the bidders and the edges represent conflicts such that the feasible\nallocations for a channel correspond to the independent sets in the conflict\ngraph.\n  In this paper, we suggest a novel LP formulation for combinatorial auctions\nwith conflict graph using a non-standard graph parameter, the so-called\ninductive independence number.

The first\nis the classical statistical setting where instances are drawn i.i.d. from a\nfixed distribution and the second scenario is the online learning, completely\nadversarial scenario where adversary at every time step picks the worst\ninstance to provide the learner with. It can be argued that in the real world\nneither of these assumptions are reasonable. It is therefore important to study\nproblems with a range of assumptions on data. Unfortunately, theoretical\nresults in this area are scarce, possibly due to absence of general tools for\nanalysis. Focusing on the regret formulation, we define the minimax value of a\ngame where the adversary is restricted in his moves. The framework captures\nstochastic and non-stochastic assumptions on data. Building on the sequential\nsymmetrization approach, we define a notion of distribution-dependent\nRademacher complexity for the spectrum of problems ranging from i.i.d. to\nworst-case.

A desirable goal in practice is to\ndesign incentive compatible, individually rational, and Pareto optimal auctions\nwhile respecting the budget constraints. Achieving this goal is particularly\nchallenging in the presence of nontrivial combinatorial constraints over the\nset of feasible allocations.\n  Toward this goal and motivated by AdWords auctions, we present an auction for\n{\\em polymatroidal} environments satisfying the above properties. Our auction\nemploys a novel clinching technique with a clean geometric description and only\nneeds an oracle access to the submodular function defining the polymatroid. As\na result, this auction not only simplifies and generalizes all previous\nresults, it applies to several new applications including AdWords Auctions,\nbandwidth markets, and video on demand. In particular, our characterization of\nthe AdWords auction as polymatroidal constraints might be of independent\ninterest. This allows us to design the first mechanism for Ad Auctions taking\ninto account simultaneously budgets, multiple keywords and multiple slots.\n  We show that it is impossible to extend this result to generic polyhedral\nconstraints.

The price to pay in the LDPC case is\nthat good efficiency is only attained for very long codes and in a very narrow\nrange centered around the quantum bit error rate (QBER) that the code was\ndesigned to reconcile, thus forcing to have several codes if a broad range of\nQBER needs to be catered for.

Most existing works proposed stationary\nspectrum sharing policies, in which users transmit at fixed power levels. Since\nusers transmit simultaneously under stationary policies, to fulfill minimum\nthroughput requirements, they need to transmit at high power levels to overcome\ninterference. To improve energy efficiency, we construct nonstationary spectrum\nsharing policies, in which the users transmit at time-varying power levels.\nSpecifically, we focus on TDMA (time-division multiple access) policies in\nwhich one user transmits at each time (but not in a round-robin fashion). The\nproposed policy can be implemented by each user running a low-complexity\nalgorithm in a decentralized manner. It achieves high energy efficiency even\nwhen the users have erroneous and binary feedback about their interference\nlevels. Moreover, it can adapt to the dynamic entry and exit of users.

The central solution concept in game theory is Nash equilibrium\n(NE). However, it fails to capture the possibility that agents can form\ncoalitions (even in the 2-agent case). Strong Nash equilibrium (SNE) refines NE\nto this setting. It is known that finding an SNE is NP-complete when the number\nof agents is constant. This hardness is solely due to the existence of\nmixed-strategy SNEs, given that the problem of enumerating all pure-strategy\nSNEs is trivially in P.

It amounts to estimating the parameters of a linear model that maps\ninput features to corresponding outputs. In the classical setting where the\nprecision of each data point is fixed, the famous Aitken/Gauss-Markov theorem\nin statistics states that generalized least squares (GLS) is a so-called \"Best\nLinear Unbiased Estimator\" (BLUE). In modern data science, however, one often\nfaces strategic data sources, namely, individuals who incur a cost for\nproviding high-precision data.\n  In this paper, we study a setting in which features are public but\nindividuals choose the precision of the outputs they reveal to an analyst. We\nassume that the analyst performs linear regression on this dataset, and\nindividuals benefit from the outcome of this estimation. We model this scenario\nas a game where individuals minimize a cost comprising two components: (a) an\n(agent-specific) disclosure cost for providing high-precision data; and (b) a\n(global) estimation cost representing the inaccuracy in the linear model\nestimate. In this game, the linear model estimate is a public good that\nbenefits all individuals. We establish that this game has a unique non-trivial\nNash equilibrium. We study the efficiency of this equilibrium and we prove\ntight bounds on the price of stability for a large class of disclosure and\nestimation costs. Finally, we study the estimator accuracy achieved at\nequilibrium. We show that, in general, Aitken's theorem does not hold under\nstrategic data sources, though it does hold if individuals have identical\ndisclosure costs (up to a multiplicative factor). When individuals have\nnon-identical costs, we derive a bound on the improvement of the equilibrium\nestimation cost that can be achieved by deviating from GLS, under mild\nassumptions on the disclosure cost functions. \n\n"}

The workers are heterogeneous with unknown\nbut fixed qualities and their costs are private. The problem is to select for\neach task an optimal subset of workers so that the outcome obtained from the\nselected workers guarantees a target accuracy level. The problem is a\nchallenging one even in a non strategic setting since the accuracy of\naggregated label depends on unknown qualities.

We derive an upper bound\non the number of time steps the algorithm chooses a sub-optimal set that\ndepends on the target accuracy level and true qualities. A more challenging\nsituation arises when the requester not only has to learn the qualities of the\nworkers but also elicit their true costs.

Cooperative games with overlapping coalitions (OCF games) are a recent\nframework proposed by Chalkiadakis et al.

Having formed overlapping coalitions and divided profits, some\nagents may feel dissatisfied with their share of the profits, and would like to\ndeviate from the given outcome. However, deviation in OCF games is a\ncomplicated matter: agents may decide to withdraw only some of their weight\nfrom some of the coalitions they belong to; that is, even after deviation, it\nis possible that agents will still be involved in tasks with non-deviators.\nThis means that the desirability of a deviation, and the stability of formed\ncoalitions, is to a great extent determined by the reaction of non-deviators.\nIn this work, we explore algorithmic aspects of OCF games, focusing on the core\nin OCF games. We study the problem of deciding if the core of an OCF game is\nnot empty, and whether a core payoff division can be found in polynomial time;\nmoreover, we identify conditions that ensure that the problem admits polynomial\ntime algorithms. Finally, we introduce and study a natural class of OCF games,\nLinear Bottleneck Games.

While exchanges over inter-node links ensure\nminimum or negligible cost, some nodes in the group try to exploit the system.\nWe term such nodes as `non-reciprocating nodes' and prohibit such behavior by\nproposing the \"Give-and-Take\" criterion, where exchange is allowed iff each\nparticipating node has segments unavailable with the other. Following this\ncriterion for inter-node links, each node wants to maximize its utility, which\ndepends on the node's segment set available with the node.

In this paper we generalize\nthis result to ensembles of general linearly independent states (not\nnecessarily pure) and also give an analytic expression for the inverse of the\nmap, i.e., for $\\mathscr{R}^{-1}$. In the process of proving this we also\nsimplify the necessary and sufficient conditions that a POVM needs to satisfy\nto maximize the probability of success for the MED of an LI ensemble of states.\nThis simplification is then employed to arrive at a rotationally invariant\nnecessary and sufficient conditions of optimality. Using these rotationally\ninvariant conditions it is established that every state of a LI mixed state\nensemble can be resolved to a pure state decomposition so that the\ncorresponding pure state ensemble (corresponding to pure states of all mixed\nstates together) has as its optimal POVM a pure state decomposition of the\noptimal POVM of mixed state ensemble.

Game theory classically considers Nash\nequilibria of one-shot games, while in practice many games are played\nrepeatedly, and in such games players often use algorithmic tools to learn to\nplay in the given environment. Most previous work on learning in repeated games\nassumes that the population playing the game is static over time.\n  We analyze the efficiency of repeated games in dynamically changing\nenvironments, motivated by application domains such as Internet ad-auctions and\npacket routing. We prove that, in many classes of games, if players choose\ntheir strategies in a way that guarantees low adaptive regret, then high social\nwelfare is ensured, even under very frequent changes. In fact, in large markets\nlearning players achieve asymptotically optimal social welfare despite high\nturnover.

A competitive\noutcome is one for which it is impossible for the seller and a subset of buyers\nto `block' the auction by defecting and negotiating an outcome with higher\npayoffs for themselves. This corresponds to the well-known concept of {\\em\ncore} in cooperative game theory.\n  In particular, VCG revenue is known to be not competitive when the goods\nbeing sold have complementarities. A bottleneck here is an impossibility result\nshowing that there is no auction that simultaneously achieves competitive\nprices (a core outcome) and incentive-compatibility.\n  In this paper we try to overcome the above impossibility result by asking the\nfollowing natural question: is it possible to design an incentive-compatible\nauction whose revenue is comparable (even if less) to a competitive outcome?\nTowards this, we define a notion of {\\em core-competitive} auctions.

To minimize electricity\nbills, it is essential for MNOs to jointly optimize the day-ahead and real-time\nenergy purchase based on their time-varying wireless traffic load. In this\npaper, we consider two different MNOs coexisting in the same area, and exploit\ntheir collaboration in both energy purchase and wireless load sharing for\nenergy cost saving. Specifically, we propose a new approach named energy group\nbuying with load sharing, in which the two MNOs are aggregated as a single\ngroup to make the day-ahead and real-time energy purchase, and their base\nstations (BSs) share the wireless traffic to maximally turn lightly-loaded BSs\ninto sleep mode. When the two MNOs belong to the same entity and aim to\nminimize their total energy cost, we use the two-stage stochastic programming\nto obtain the optimal day-ahead and real-time energy group buying jointly with\nwireless load sharing.

For spins, however,\nspontaneous emission is generally negligible compared to other non-radiative\nrelaxation processes because of the weak coupling between the magnetic dipole\nand the electromagnetic field. In 1946, Purcell realized that the spontaneous\nemission rate can be strongly enhanced by placing the quantum system in a\nresonant cavity -an effect which has since been used extensively to control the\nlifetime of atoms and semiconducting heterostructures coupled to microwave or\noptical cavities, underpinning single-photon sources. Here we report the first\napplication of these ideas to spins in solids. By coupling donor spins in\nsilicon to a superconducting microwave cavity of high quality factor and small\nmode volume, we reach for the first time the regime where spontaneous emission\nconstitutes the dominant spin relaxation mechanism. The relaxation rate is\nincreased by three orders of magnitude when the spins are tuned to the cavity\nresonance, showing that energy relaxation can be engineered and controlled\non-demand. Our results provide a novel and general way to initialise spin\nsystems into their ground state, with applications in magnetic resonance and\nquantum information processing.

An important question is how much the equilibria degrade in\nthe face of strategic behavior, i.e. what is the Price of Anarchy (PoA) of the\nmarket viewed as a mechanism?\n  Often, PoA bounds are modest constants such as 4/3 or 2. Nonetheless, in\npractice a guarantee that no more than 25% or 50% of the economic value is lost\nmay be unappealing. This paper asks whether significantly better bounds are\npossible under plausible assumptions.

In this work, an aggregator is seen as an entity (a coalition) which\nis able to manage jointly the energy demand of a large group of consumers or\nusers. More precisely, the demand consists in charging an electrical vehicle\n(EV) battery. The way the EVs user charge their batteries matters since it\nstrongly impacts the network, especially the distribution network costs (e.g.,\nin terms of Joule losses or transformer ageing). Since the charging policy is\nchosen by the users or the aggregators, the charging problem is naturally\ndistributed. It turns out that one of the tools suited to tackle this\nheterogenous scenario has been introduced only recently namely, through the\nnotion of composite games. This paper exploits for the first time in the\nliterature of smart grids the notion of composite game and equilibrium.

Each agent's\nobjective is to maximize, within the items chosen for inclusion in the\nknapsack, the total valuation of her own chosen items. The knapsack problem, in\nthis context, seeks to minimize the worst-case approximation ratio for social\nwelfare at equilibrium. We show that a randomized greedy mechanism has\nattractive strategic properties: in general, it has a correlated price of\nanarchy of $2$ (subject to a mild assumption).

The Liquid Welfare objective function has been\nsuggested as a natural alternative for settings with budgets. Simple auctions,\nlike simultaneous item auctions, are evaluated by their performance at\nequilibrium using the Price of Anarchy (PoA) measure -- the ratio of the\nobjective function value of the optimal outcome to the worst equilibrium.\nAccordingly, we evaluate the performance of simultaneous item auctions in\nbudgeted settings by the Liquid Price of Anarchy (LPoA) measure -- the ratio of\nthe optimal Liquid Welfare to the Liquid Welfare obtained in the worst\nequilibrium.\n  Our main result is that the LPoA for mixed Nash equilibria is bounded by a\nconstant when bidders are additive and items can be divided into sufficiently\nmany discrete parts.

Our aim is to establish how\ngrouping and cooperation among users affect performance bounds. We consider two\ntypes of grouping. The first type is from \\cite{Zhang2014}, where each user\nbelongs to a group of users having social ties with it. For this type of\nutility system, each user's strategy maximizes its social group utility\nfunction, giving rise to the notion of \\emph{social-aware Nash equilibrium}. We\nprove that this social utility system yields to the bounding results of Vetta\nfor non-cooperative system, thus establishing provable performance guarantees\nfor the social-aware Nash equilibrium. For the second type of grouping, the set\nof users is partitioned into $l$ disjoint groups, where the users within a\ngroup cooperate to maximize their group utility function, giving rise to the\nnotion of \\emph{group Nash equilibrium}. In this case, each group can be viewed\nas a new user with vector-valued actions, and a 1/2 bound for the performance\nof group Nash equilibrium follows from the result of Vetta. But as we show\ntighter bounds involving curvature can be established. By defining the group\ncurvature $c_{k_i}$ associated with group $i$ with $k_i$ users, we show that if\nthe social utility function is nondecreasing and submodular, then any group\nNash equilibrium achieves at least $1/(1+\\max_{1\\leq i\\leq l}c_{k_i})$ of the\noptimal social utility, which is tighter than that for the case without\ngrouping. As a special case, if each user has the same action space, then we\nhave that any group Nash equilibrium achieves at least $1/(1+c_{k^*})$ of the\noptimal social utility, where $k^*$ is the least number of users among the $l$\ngroups. Finally, we present an example of a utility system for database\nassisted spectrum access to illustrate our results. \n\n"}

Despite this strong and oftentimes\nunrealistic assumption, it is remarkable that the revenue-maximizing\ncombinatorial auction remains unknown. In recent years, automated mechanism\ndesign has emerged as one of the most practical and promising approaches to\ndesigning high-revenue combinatorial auctions. The most scalable automated\nmechanism design algorithms take as input samples from the bidders' valuation\ndistribution and then search for a high-revenue auction in a rich auction\nclass. In this work, we provide the first sample complexity analysis for the\nstandard hierarchy of deterministic combinatorial auction classes used in\nautomated mechanism design. In particular, we provide tight sample complexity\nbounds on the number of samples needed to guarantee that the empirical revenue\nof the designed mechanism on the samples is close to its expected revenue on\nthe underlying, unknown distribution over bidder valuations, for each of the\nauction classes in the hierarchy.

For two-sided markets, an impossibility result of\nMyerson and Satterthwaite states that no mechanism can simultaneously satisfy\nindividual rationality (IR), incentive compatibility (IC), strong\nbudget-balance (SBB), and be efficient.

Thus, how to optimally bid on an ad impression to drive the\nprofit and return-on-investment becomes essential.

This\nsystem can be totally governed by a two-mode Dicke-lattice model, which\nincludes all of the counter-rotating terms and therefore works well in the\nultrastrong coupling regime achieved in recent experiments. Attributed to its\nspecial atom-photon coupling scheme, this model supports a global conserved\nexcitation and a continuous $U(1)$ symmetry, rather than the discrete $Z_{2}$\nsymmetry in the standard Dicke-lattice model. This distinct change of symmetry\nvia adding an extra photon mode strongly impacts the nature of photon\nlocalization/delocalization behavior. Specifically, the atom-photon interaction\nfeatures stable Mott-lobe structures of photons and a second-order\nsuperfluid-Mott-insulator phase transition, which share similarities with the\nJaynes-Cummings-lattice and Bose-Hubbard models.

Such results are known for graph\nclasses of bounded tree-width, DAG-width, directed path-width, and\nentanglement, which we describe in terms of cops and robber games. Conversely,\nthe introduction of imperfect information makes the problem more difficult, it\nbecomes EXPTIME-hard. We analyse the interaction of both approaches.\n  We use a simple method to measure the amount of \"unawareness\"' of a player,\nthe amount of imperfect information. It turns out that if it is unbounded, low\nstructural complexity does not make the problem simpler. It remains\nEXPTIME-hard or PSPACE-hard even on very simple graphs.\n  For games with bounded imperfect information we analyse the powerset\nconstruction, which is commonly used to convert a game of imperfect information\ninto an equivalent game with perfect information.

This problem is known\nto be NP-hard in general. Our contribution is two fold: a polyhedral\ncharacterization and an approximation algorithm. Previously Chen et al. have\nshown that the stable matching polytope is integral if and only if the subgraph\nobtained after running phase one of Irving's algorithm is bipartite. We improve\nupon this result by showing that there are instances where this subgraph might\nnot be bipartite but one can further eliminate some edges and arrive at a\nbipartite subgraph. Our elimination procedure ensures that the set of stable\nmatchings remains the same, and thus the stable matching polytope of the final\nsubgraph contains the incidence vectors of all stable matchings of our original\ngraph. This allows us to characterize a larger class of instances for which the\nweighted stable matching problem is polynomial-time solvable.

Without having any information on the underlying cardinal\nutilities, arguing about fairness of allocation requires extending the ordinal\nitem ranking to ordinal bundle ranking. The most commonly used such extension\nis stochastic dominance (SD), where a bundle X is preferred over a bundle Y if\nits score is better according to all additive score functions. SD is a very\nconservative extension, by which few allocations are necessarily fair while\nmany allocations are possibly fair. We propose to make a natural assumption on\nthe underlying cardinal utilities of the players, namely that the difference\nbetween two items at the top is larger than the difference between two items at\nthe bottom. This assumption implies a preference extension which we call\ndiminishing differences (DD), where X is preferred over Y if its score is\nbetter according to all additive score functions satisfying the DD assumption.\nWe give a full characterization of allocations that are\nnecessarily-proportional or possibly-proportional according to this assumption.\nBased on this characterization, we present a polynomial-time algorithm for\nfinding a necessarily-DD-proportional allocation if it exists. Using\nsimulations, we show that with high probability, a necessarily-proportional\nallocation does not exist but a necessarily-DD-proportional allocation exists,\nand moreover, that allocation is proportional according to the underlying\ncardinal utilities.

Equilibrium refinements can mend this issue, but have\nexperienced little practical adoption. This is largely due to a lack of\nscalable algorithms.\n  Sparse iterative methods, in particular first-order methods, are known to be\namong the most effective algorithms for computing Nash equilibria in\nlarge-scale two-player zero-sum extensive-form games. In this paper, we\nprovide, to our knowledge, the first extension of these methods to equilibrium\nrefinements. We develop a smoothing approach for behavioral perturbations of\nthe convex polytope that encompasses the strategy spaces of players in an\nextensive-form game.

It was recently shown that\nthe only mechanisms that are simultaneously DSIC, SBB, and ex-post IR, are\nfixed price mechanisms, i.e., mechanisms that are parametrised by a price p,\nand trade occurs if and only if the valuation of the buyer is at least p and\nthe valuation of the seller is at most p.

A\ncorollary of this result is that, unless W[2] $=$ FPT, the problem cannot be\napproximated in FPT time to within a factor that is a function of $k$.

In lieu of explicit diagonalization of the\nKohn-Sham Hamiltonian on every self-consistent field (SCF) iteration, we employ\na two-level Chebyshev polynomial filter based complementary subspace strategy\nto: 1) compute a set of vectors that span the occupied subspace of the\nHamiltonian; 2) reduce subspace diagonalization to just partially occupied\nstates; and 3) obtain those states in an efficient, scalable manner via an\ninner Chebyshev-filter iteration. By reducing the necessary computation to just\npartially occupied states, and obtaining these through an inner Chebyshev\niteration, our approach reduces the cost of large metallic calculations\nsignificantly, while eliminating subspace diagonalization for insulating\nsystems altogether.

The problem is cast as a dynamic game among\nUAVs. To solve this game, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, based on\necho state network (ESN) cells, is proposed. The introduced deep ESN\narchitecture is trained to allow each UAV to map each observation of the\nnetwork state to an action, with the goal of minimizing a sequence of\ntime-dependent utility functions. Each UAV uses ESN to learn its optimal path,\ntransmission power level, and cell association vector at different locations\nalong its path.

This partially answers a question of\nShpilka-Yehudayoff and has applications to hardness-randomness tradeoffs for\nbounded depth arithmetic circuits. More precisely, this shows that a\nsuperpolynomial lower bound for bounded depth arithmetic circuits, for a family\nof explicit polynomials of degree poly$(\\log n)$ implies deterministic\nsub-exponential time algorithms for polynomial identity testing (PIT) for\nbounded depth arithmetic circuits. This is incomparable to a beautiful result\nof Dvir et al., where they showed that super-polynomial lower bounds for\nconstant depth arithmetic circuits for any explicit family of polynomials (of\npotentially high degree) implies sub-exponential time deterministic PIT for\nbounded depth circuits of bounded individual degree.

Such optimal LRCs have been constructed over alphabets growing\nlinearly in the block length. Unlike the classical Singleton bound, however, it\nwas not known if such a linear growth in the alphabet size is necessary, or for\nthat matter even if the alphabet needs to grow at all with the block length.\nIndeed, for small code distances $3,4$, arbitrarily long optimal LRCs were\nknown over fixed alphabets.\n  Here, we prove that for distances $d \\ge 5$, the code length $n$ of an\noptimal LRC over an alphabet of size $q$ must be at most roughly $O(d q^3)$.\nFor the case $d=5$, our upper bound is $O(q^2)$.

Nonetheless, due to the limited computational capabilities\nof the SBSs, coupled with the scarcity of the wireless bandwidth resources,\nminimizing the E2E latency for AVs and achieving a reliable V2I network is\nchallenging.

We propose a simple and agnostic strategy, independent of the\ndistribution of the competition, that is robust to mechanism changes and local\n(as opposed to global) optimization of e.g. reserve prices by the seller. This\nstrategy guarantees an increase in utility compared to the truthful strategy\nfor any distribution of the competition. In textbook-style examples, for\ninstance with uniform [0,1] value distributions and two bidders, this\nno-side-information and mechanism-independent strategy yields an enormous 57%\nincrease in buyer utility for lazy second price auctions with monopoly\nreserves.

We show two types of such gates, $U_{1}$ and $U_{2}$,\nin the form of $\\text{diag}\\{1, e^{i\\alpha}, e^{i\\gamma}, e^{i\\beta}\\}$, where\n$\\alpha, \\gamma$, and $\\beta$ are determined by the parameters of lasers and\nthe Rydberg blockade $V$. $U_{1}$ is realized by sending to the two qubits a\nsingle off-resonant laser pulse, while $U_{2}$ is realized by individually\napplying one pulse of detuned laser to each qubit. Our method has several\nadvantages. First, the gates are accurate because the fidelity of $U_k$ is\nlimited only by a rotation error below $10^{-5}$ and the Rydberg-state decay.\nDecay error on the order of $10^{-5}$ can be easily obtained because all\ntransitions are detuned, resulting in small population in Rydberg state.\nSecond, the motion-induced dephasing is minimized because there is no gap time\nin which a population is left in the Rydberg shelving states of either qubit.\nThird, the gate is resilient to the variation of $V$. This is because among the\nthree phases $\\alpha,\\gamma$, and $\\beta$, only the last has a (partial)\ndependence on $V$. Fourth, the Rabi frequency and $V$ in our scheme are of\nsimilar magnitude, which permits a fast implementation of the gate when both of\nthem are of the feasible magnitude of several megahertz. The rapidity,\naccuracy, and feasibility of this interference method can lay the foundation\nfor entangling gates in universal quantum computing with neutral atoms. \n\n"}

In this model, each vertex of a graph\ncan be either truthful or corrupt. Each vertex reports about the types\n(truthful or corrupt) of all its neighbors to a central agency, where truthful\nnodes report the true types they see and corrupt nodes report adversarially.\nThe central agency aggregates these reports and attempts to find a single\ntruthful node. Inspired by real auditing networks, we pose our problem for\narbitrary graphs and consider corruption through a computational lens. We\nidentify a key combinatorial parameter of the graph $m(G)$, which is the\nminimal number of corrupted agents needed to prevent the central agency from\nidentifying a single truthful node. We give an efficient (in fact, linear time)\nalgorithm for the central agency to identify a truthful node that is successful\nwhenever the number of corrupt nodes is less than $m(G)/2$. On the other hand,\nwe prove that for any constant $\\alpha > 1$, it is NP-hard to find a subset of\nnodes $S$ in $G$ such that corrupting $S$ prevents the central agency from\nfinding one truthful node and $|S| \\leq \\alpha m(G)$, assuming the Small Set\nExpansion Hypothesis (Raghavendra and Steurer, STOC '10). We conclude that\nbeing corrupt requires being clever, while detecting corruption does not.\n  Our main technical insight is a relation between the minimum number of\ncorrupt nodes required to hide all truthful nodes and a certain notion of\nvertex separability for the underlying graph. Additionally, this insight lets\nus design an efficient algorithm for a corrupt party to decide which graphs\nrequire the fewest corrupted nodes, up to a multiplicative factor of $O(\\log\nn)$. \n\n"}

This is in contrast\nto even the context-free languages, which we show can have query complexity\nTheta(n^c) for all computable c in [1/2,1]. Our result implies an equivalent\ntrichotomy for the approximate degree of regular languages, and a\ndichotomy---either Theta(1) or Theta(n)---for sensitivity, block sensitivity,\ncertificate complexity, deterministic query complexity, and randomized query\ncomplexity.\n  The heart of the classification theorem is an explicit quantum algorithm\nwhich decides membership in any star-free language in ~O(sqrt n) time. This\nwell-studied family of the regular languages admits many interesting\ncharacterizations, for instance, as those languages expressible as sentences in\nfirst-order logic over the natural numbers with the less-than relation.\nTherefore, not only do the star-free languages capture functions such as OR,\nthey can also express functions such as \"there exist a pair of 2's such that\neverything between them is a 0.\"\n  Thus, we view the algorithm for star-free languages as a nontrivial\ngeneralization of Grover's algorithm which extends the quantum quadratic\nspeedup to a much wider range of string-processing algorithms than was\npreviously known.

Our proofs use new tools for upper\nbounding the asymptotic slice rank of a wide range of tensors. Our main result\nis that the Universal method applied to any Coppersmith-Winograd tensor $CW_q$\ncannot yield a bound on $\\omega$, the exponent of matrix multiplication, better\nthan $2.16805$. By comparison, it was previously only known that the weaker\n`Galactic Method' applied to $CW_q$ could not achieve an exponent of $2$.\n  We also study the Laser Method (which is, in principle, a highly special case\nof the Universal Method) and prove that it is \"complete\" for matrix\nmultiplication algorithms: when it applies to a tensor $T$, it achieves $\\omega\n= 2$ if and only if it is possible for the Universal method applied to $T$ to\nachieve $\\omega = 2$. Hence, the Laser Method, which was originally used as an\nalgorithmic tool, can also be seen as a lower bounding tool.

Abstract: It is known that connected and autonomous vehicles are capable of maintaining\nshorter headways and distances when they form platoons of vehicles. Thus, such\ntechnologies can result in increases in the capacities of traffic networks.\nConsequently, it is envisioned that their deployment will boost the network\nmobility. In this paper, we verify the validity of this impact under selfish\nrouting behavior of drivers in traffic networks with mixed autonomy, i.e.\ntraffic networks with both regular and autonomous vehicles. We consider a\nnonatomic routing game on a network with inelastic (fixed) demands for the set\nof network O/D pairs, and study how replacing a fraction of regular vehicles by\nautonomous vehicles will affect the mobility of the network. Using the well\nknown US bureau of public roads (BPR) traffic delay models, we show that the\nresulting Wardrop equilibrium is not necessarily unique even in its weak sense\nfor networks with mixed autonomy. We state the conditions under which the total\nnetwork delay is guaranteed not to increase as a result of autonomy increase.\nHowever, we show that when these conditions do not hold, counter intuitive\nbehaviors may occur: the total delay can grow by increasing the network\nautonomy. In particular, we prove that for networks with a single O/D pair, if\nthe road degrees of asymmetry are homogeneous, the total delay is 1) unique,\nand 2) a nonincreasing continuous function of network autonomy fraction. We\nshow that for heterogeneous degrees of asymmetry, the total delay is not\nunique, and it can further grow with autonomy increase.

They proved\nthe MA-completeness of the problem of deciding whether the groundenergy of a\nuniform stoquastic local Hamiltonian is zero or inverse polynomial. We show\nthat the gapped version of this problem, i.e. deciding if a given uniform\nstoquastic local Hamiltonian is frustration-free or has energy at least some\nconstant $\\epsilon$, is in NP. Thus, if there exists a gap-amplification\nprocedure for uniform stoquastic Local Hamiltonians (in analogy to the gap\namplification procedure for constraint satisfaction problems in the original\nPCP theorem), then MA = NP (and vice versa).

To judge\nwhether such superposition is hidden in a general state, we use an essentially\nunique index p: A pure state is macroscopically entangled if p=2, whereas it\nmay be entangled but not macroscopically if p<2. This index is directly related\nto the stability of the state. We calculate the index p for various states in\nwhich magnons are excited with various densities and wavenumbers. We find\nmacroscopically entangled states (p=2) as well as states with p=1. The former\nstates are unstable in the sense that they are unstable against some local\nmeasurements. On the other hand, the latter states are stable in the senses\nthat they are stable against local measurements and that their decoherence\nrates never exceed O(N) in any weak classical noises.

This fact is a support for a known method to calculate\nthe Holevo capacity. To consider an applicability of this method to quantum\nstates of a higher level system, it is essential to check if the coincidence of\nthe Voronoi diagrams also occurs.

Each probability corresponds to a specific scenario -- a class of 4 x\n4 density matrices (rho) with an m-subset (m<6) of its six off-diagonal pairs\nof symmetrically located entries set to zero. Initially, we consider only\nscenarios in which the (6-m) non-nullified pairs are real, but then permit them\nto be complex (as well as quaternionic) in nature also. The general analytical\nstrategy we implement is based on the Bloore density matrix parameterization\n(J. Phys. A, 9, 2059 [1976]), allowing us to conveniently reduce the\ndimensionalities of required integrations. For each scenario, we identify a\ncertain univariate ``separability function'' S_{scenario}(nu), where nu =\nrho_{11} rho_{44}/(rho_{22} rho_{33}). The integral over nu in [0,infty] of the\nproduct of this function with a scenario-specific (marginal) jacobian function\nJ_{scenario}(nu) yields the HS {separable} volume (V^{HS}_{sep}). The ratio of\nV^{HS}_{sep} to the HS total (entangled and non-entangled) volume, gives us the\nHS scenario-specific separability probability.

Secondly, a converse trade-off relation holds for\nseparable states: if both local angles approach \\pi/2 the maximal value\nobtainable for the correlations in the Bell inequality decreases and thus the\nnon-violation increases. As expected, the extremes of these relations are found\nin the case of anti-commuting local observables where respectively the bounds\nof 2\\sqrt{2} and \\sqrt{2} hold for the expectation of the Bell operator. The\ntrade-off relations show that non-commmutativity gives ``a more than classical\nresult\" for entangled states, whereas \"a less than classical result\" is\nobtained for separable states. The experimental relevance of the trade-off\nrelation for separable states is that it provides an experimental test for two\nqubit entanglement.
