The catalog consists of the objects\nin the SDSS Fifth Data Release that have luminosities larger than M_i = -22.0\n(in a cosmology with H_0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, Omega_M = 0.3, and Omega_Lambda = 0.7)\nhave at least one emission line with FWHM larger than 1000 km/s, or have\ninteresting/complex absorption features, are fainter than i=15.0, and have\nhighly reliable redshifts. The area covered by the catalog is 5740 sq. deg. The\nquasar redshifts range from 0.08 to 5.41, with a median value of 1.48; the\ncatalog includes 891 quasars at redshifts greater than four, of which 36 are at\nredshifts greater than five. Approximately half of the catalog quasars have i <\n19; nearly all have i < 21. For each object the catalog presents positions\naccurate to better than 0.2 arcsec. rms per coordinate, five-band (ugriz)\nCCD-based photometry with typical accuracy of 0.03 mag, and information on the\nmorphology and selection method. The catalog also contains basic radio,\nnear-infrared, and X-ray emission properties of the quasars, when available,\nfrom other large-area surveys. The calibrated digital spectra cover the\nwavelength region 3800--9200A at a spectral resolution of ~2000. The spectra\ncan be retrieved from the public database using the information provided in the\ncatalog. The average SDSS colors of quasars as a function of redshift, derived\nfrom the catalog entries, are presented in tabular form.

Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on\nthe role that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in\nglobular clusters, e.g., influencing the distribution of horizontal branch\nstars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of some globular clusters, and in\nforming low mass white dwarfs. \n\n"}

As young AGN\n(quasars) they are initially several magnitudes sub-luminous to mature galaxies\nbut their luminosity gradually increases over 10^8 yrs, as z_(i) decreases and\nthey evolve into mature AGN (Seyferts and radio galaxies). Evidence presented\nhere that low- and intermediate-redshift AGN are unquestionably sub-luminous to\nradio galaxies is then strong support for this model and makes it likely that\nthe high-redshift AGN (quasars) are also sub-luminous, having simply been\npushed above the radio galaxies on a logz-m_(v) plot by the presence of a large\nintrinsic component in their redshifts.

The galaxy is known to possess a dramatic 70 kpc\nX-ray tail. The detected H-alpha tail coincides positionally with the X-ray\ntail. The H-alpha emission in the galaxy is sharply truncated on the front and\nthe sides near the nucleus, indicating significant ram pressure stripping. ESO\n137-001 is thus the first cluster late-type galaxy known unambiguously with\nboth an X-ray tail and an H-alpha tail. The emission-line objects are all\ndistributed downstream of the galaxy, with projected distance up to 39 kpc from\nthe galaxy. From the analysis on the H-alpha_{off} frame and the estimate of\nthe background emission-line objects, we conclude that it is very likely all 29\nemission-line objects are HII regions in A3627. The high surface number density\nand luminosities of these HII regions (up to 10^40 ergs/s) dwarf the previously\nknown examples of isolated HII regions in clusters.

The total mass of formed stars in the stripped ISM of ESO\n137-001 may approach several times 10^7 solar masses. Therefore, stripping of\nthe ISM not only contributes to the ICM, but also adds to the intracluster\nstellar light through subsequent star formation.

Abstract: The prediction that (due to the limited amount of hydrogen available as fuel\nin the Sun) the future duration of our favourable terrestrial environment will\nbe short (compared with the present age of the Earth) has been interpreted as\nevidence for a hard step scenario. This means that some of the essential steps\n(such as the development of eukaryotes) in the evolution process leading to the\nultimate emergence of intelligent life would have been hard, in the sense of\nbeing against the odds in the available time, so that they are unlikely to have\nbeen achieved in most of the earth-like planets that may one day be discovered\nin nearby extra-solar systems.

Finding more examples would be very significant. The\nselected target, q1 Eri, is a solar-type star, which was known to possess a\nplanet, q1 Eri b, and to exhibit excess emission at IRAS wavelengths, but had\nremained undetected in the millimeter regime. Therefore, submm flux densities\nwould be needed to better constrain the physical characteristics of the\nplanetary disk. Consequently, we performed submm imaging observations of q1\nEri. The detected dust toward q1 Eri at 870 micron exhibits the remarkable fact\nthat the entire SED, from the IR to mm-wavelengths, is fit by a single\ntemperature blackbody function (60 K). This would imply that the emitting\nregions are confined to a narrow region (ring) at radial distances much larger\nthan the orbital distance of q1 Eri b, and that the emitting particles are\nconsiderably larger than some hundred micron.

Gas discs may dominate binary\ndynamics on these scales, and promote mergers. Using numerical simulations, we\ninvestigate the evolution of the orbits of binaries embedded within\ngeometrically thin gas discs.

We show that the binary decays at a rate which is in good\nagreement with analytical estimates, while the eccentricity grows. Saturation\nof eccentricity growth is not observed up to values e > 0.35. Accretion onto\nthe black holes is variable, and is roughly modulated by the binary orbital\nfrequency. Scaling our results, we analytically estimate the maximum rate of\nbinary decay that is possible without fragmentation occuring within the\nsurrounding gas disc, and compare that rate to an estimate of the stellar\ndynamical hardening rate. For binary masses in the range 10^5 < M/Msun < 10^8\nwe find that decay due to gas discs may dominate for separations below a ~\n0.01--0.1 pc, where the disc is optically thick.

A Quark-Nova (QN) can occur over a\nrange of time scales following the supernova event. For QNe that arise days to\nweeks after the supernovae, we show that dual-shock that arises as the QN\nejecta encounter the supernova ejecta can produce enough photons to reionize\nhydrogen in most of the Inter-Galactic medium (IGM) by z ~ 6.

First we demonstrate that some\nsize evolution of the population can be expected simply due to the continuous\nemergence of early-type galaxies. SDSS data reveal that in the present-day\nuniverse more compact early-type galaxies with a given dynamical mass have\nolder stellar populations. In contrast, at a given stellar velocity dispersion,\nSDSS data show that there is no relation between size and age, which implies\nthat the velocity dispersion can be used to estimate the epoch at which\ngalaxies stopped forming stars, turning into early-type galaxies. Applying such\na 'formation' criterion to a large sample of nearby early-type galaxies, we\npredict the redshift evolution in the size distribution and the comoving mass\ndensity. The resulting evolution in the mean size is roughly half of the\nobserved evolution. Then we include a prescription for the merger histories of\ngalaxies between the 'formation' redshift and the present, based on\ncosmological simulations of the assembly of dark matter halos.

The origin of the radio emission is\nunclear,it could be due either to a jet, as in microquasars, or to the shock\nboundary between the Be star and a possible pulsar wind. We here analyze the\nradio spectral index over 6.7 yr from Green Bank Interferometer data at 2.2 GHz\nand 8.3 GHz. We find two new characteristics in the radio emission. The first\ncharacteristic is that the periodic outbursts indeed consist of two consecutive\noutbursts; the first outburst is optically thick, whereas the second outburst\nis optically thin. The spectrum of LS I +61 303 is well reproduced by the\nshock-in-jet model commonly used in the context of microquasars and AGNs: the\noptically thin spectrum is due to shocks caused by relativistic plasma\n(\"transient jet\") traveling through a pre-existing much slower steady flow\n(\"steady jet\"). This steady flow is responsible for the preceding optically\nthick spectrum. The second characteristic we find is that the observed spectral\nevolution, from optically thick to optically thin emission, occurs twice during\nthe orbital period. We observed this occurrence at the orbital phase of the\nmain 26.5 d outburst and also at an earlier phase, shifted by $\\Delta \\Phi\n\\sim$ 0.3 (i.e almost 8 days before). We show that this result qualitatively\nand quantitatively agrees with the two-peak accretion/ejection model proposed\nin the past for LS I +61303.

Abstract: The observations show that less massive the galaxies are, the higher on\naverage is their specific star formation rate (SSFR = SFR/Ms, Ms is the stellar\nmass). Such a trend, called the 'SSFR downsizing' (SSFR-DS) phenomenon, is seen\nfor local and high-z (back to z~1-2) galaxy samples. We use observational data\nrelated only to disc galaxies and explore the average SSFR change with z for\ndifferent masses. For Ms in the range ~10^9.5-10^10.5 Msun, the SSFR increases\nwith (1+z) to a power that barely depends on Ms, and at all z's smaller\ngalaxies have ever higher SSFRs. The latter strongly disagree with the LCDM\nhierarchical mass accretion rates. By means of self-consistent models of disc\ngalaxy evolution inside growing LCDM halos, the effects that disc\nfeedback-driven outflows and gas re-accretion have on the galaxy SSFR histories\nare explored.

The\ntechnical reason for this effect to occur is the property of Bogolubov's\ncoefficients which mix the positive and negative frequencies modes. The\ncorresponding mixture can not be avoided because the projections to positive\n-frequency modes with respect to Minkowski time t and positive -frequency modes\nwith respect to the Rindler observer's proper time \\eta are not equivalent. The\nexact cancellation of unphysical degrees of freedom which is maintained in\nMinkowski space can not hold in the Rindler space. In BRST approach this effect\nmanifests itself as the presence of BRST charge density in L and R parts.

Using a set of collisionless N-body simulations, we investigate the\nefficiency of the tidal stirring mechanism. We explore a wide variety of dwarf\norbital configurations and initial structures and demonstrate that in most\ncases the disky dwarfs experience significant mass loss and their stellar\ncomponents undergo a dramatic morphological and dynamical transformation: from\ndisks to bars and finally to pressure-supported spheroidal systems with\nkinematic and structural properties akin to those of the classic dSphs in the\nLocal Group (LG). Our results suggest that such tidal transformations should be\ncommon occurrences within the currently favored cosmological paradigm and\nhighlight the key factor responsible for an effective metamorphosis to be the\nstrength of the tidal shocks at the pericenters of the orbit. We demonstrate\nthat the combination of short orbital times and small pericenters,\ncharacteristic of dwarfs being accreted at high redshift, induces the strongest\ntransformations. Our models also indicate that the transformation efficiency is\naffected significantly by the structure of the progenitor disky dwarfs.

Finding the origin of this variability would constrain the still\nlargely unknown properties of this extraordinary object. Since it exhibits an\nintensity-hardness behavior characteristic of black-hole X-ray transients, we\nhave analyzed the variability of HLX-1 in the framework of the disk instability\nmodel that explains outbursts of such systems. We find that the long-term\nvariability of HLX-1 is unlikely to be explained by a model in which outbursts\nare triggered by thermal-viscous instabilities in an accretion disc. Possible\nalternatives include the instability in a radiation-pressure dominated disk but\nwe argue that a more likely explanation is a modulated mass-transfer due to\ntidal stripping of a star on an eccentric orbit around the intermediate-mass\nblack hole. We consider an evolutionary scenario leading to the creation of\nsuch a system and estimate the probability of its observation.

Obtaining an accurate and precise inversion is\nchallenging, and we opted for a noise reduction technique applied on the\ncovariance matrices. By measuring the bootstrap error on the inverted matrix,\nthis work quantifies for the first time the significance of the non-Gaussian\nerror corrections on the BAO dilation scale. We find that the variance (error\nsquared) on distance measurements can deviate by up to 12% between both\nestimators, an effect that requires a large number of simulations to be\nresolved. We next apply a reconstruction algorithm to recover some of the BAO\nsignal that had been smeared by non-linear evolution, and we rerun the\nanalysis. We find that after reconstruction, the rms error on the distance\nmeasurement improves by a factor of ~1.7 at low redshift (consistent with\nprevious results), and the variance ({\\sigma}^2) shows a change of up to 18%\nbetween optimal and sub-optimal cases (note, however, that these discrepancies\nmay depend in detail on the procedure used to isolate the BAO signal).

Optical spectroscopy of this object has suggested a distance of ~7\nkpc and an identification with a low mass X-ray binary.

The issue that appears to have been missed in many\nstudies is that in cosmology the strength of gravity is bound up in the\ncosmological equations, and the epoch at which we live is a crucial part of the\nmodel.

The velocity dispersion and core\nradius of the main cluster potential show strong correlations with the\npredicted magnifications and can therefore be constrained by observations of\nSNe Ia in background galaxies. This technique proves especially powerful for\ngalaxy clusters with only few known multiple image systems.

The disc is assumed to be\ncontinuously fed by cold gas at the average cosmological rate. The gas forms\nstars and is partly driven away by stellar feedback. The gas and stars flow\ninward through the disc to a central bulge due to torques that drive angular\nmomentum outwards. The gravitational energy released by the mass inflow down\nthe gravitational potential gradient drives the disc turbulence that maintains\nthe disc unstable with a Toomre instability parameter Q~1, compensating for the\ndissipative losses of the gas turbulence and raising the stellar velocity\ndispersion. We follow the velocity dispersion of stars and gas as they heat and\ncool respectively and search for disc `stabilization', to be marked by a low\ngas velocity dispersion comparable to the speed of sound ~10 km/s.

These profiles agree with the\noutcomes of state-of-the-art N-body simulations in the radial range currently\nprobed by the latter; at smaller radii, we provide specific predictions. In the\nperspective provided by our self-similar solutions we link the halo structure\nto its two-stage growth history, and propose the following picture. During the\nearly fast collapse of the inner region dominated by a few merging clumps,\nefficient dynamical relaxation plays a key role in producing a closely\nuniversal mass density and pseudo phase-space density profiles; in particular,\nthese are found to depend only weakly on the detailed shape of the initial\nperturbation and the related collapse times. The subsequent inside-out growth\nof the outer regions feeds on the slow accretion of many small clumps and\ndiffuse matter; thus the outskirts are only mildly affected by dynamical\nrelaxation but are more sensitive to asymmetries and cosmological variance. \n\n"}

The\nformation of the penumbra is intimately related to the inclined magnetic field.\nWithin 4.5 h observing time, the magnetic flux of the penumbra increases from\n9.7E+20 to 18.2E+20 Mx, while the magnetic flux of the umbra remains constant\nat about 3.8E+20 Mx.

At the same time, this result disproved the\nmodel of a single black hole system with accretion disk oscillations, as well\nas several toy models of binaries without relativistic precession.

This was\nconfirmed by combined ground based and ultraviolet observations using the\nXMM-Newton X-ray telescope. (3) A secondary outburst of the same nature was\nexpected at 2007 September 13. Within the accuracy of the observations (about 6\nhours), it started at the correct time. Due to the bremsstrahlung nature of the\noutburst, the radiation was unpolarized, as expected. (4) Further synchrotron\noutbursts were expected following the two bremsstrahlung outbursts. They came\nas scheduled between 2007 October and 2009 December.

These features allow it to converge to\nhigh-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods\nsuch as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC's performance is\nhighly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size {\\epsilon} and a\ndesired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm\nexhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the\nalgorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an\nextension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L.

Aims: We determine if non-ideal MHD, including\nthe effects of ambipolar diffusion and Ohmic dissipation determined from a\ndetailed chemical network model, allows for disk formation at the earliest\nstages of star formation (SF). Methods: We employ the axisymmetric thin-disk\napproximation in order to resolve a dynamic range of 9 orders of magnitude in\nlength and 16 in density, while also calculating partial ionization using up to\n19 species in a detailed chemical equilibrium model. MB is applied using a\nsteady-state approximation, and a barotropic relation is used to capture the\nthermal evolution. Results: We resolve the formation of the first and second\ncores, with expansion waves at the periphery of each, a magnetic diffusion\nshock, and prestellar infall profiles at larger radii. Power-law profiles in\neach region can be understood analytically. After the formation of the second\ncore, centrifugal support rises rapidly and a low-mass disk of radius ~10 R_Sun\nis formed, when the second core has mass ~0.001 M_Sun. The mass-to-flux ratio\nis ~10,000 times the critical value in the central region.

The warm skins of the SF disk are governed\nby the radiation from the inner part of the accretion disk to form Compton\natmosphere (CAS). The CAS are undergoing four phases to form broad line\nregions. Phase I is the duration of pure accumulation supplied by the SF disk.\nDuring phase II clouds begin to form due to line cooling and sink to the SF\ndisk. Phase III is a period of preventing clouds from sinking to the SF disk\nthrough dynamic interaction between clouds and the CAS. Finally, phase IV is an\ninevitable collapse of the entire CAS through line cooling. This CAS evolution\ndrives the episodic appearance of BLRs. Geometry and dynamics of BLRs can be\nself-consistently derived from the thermal instability of the CAS during phases\nII and III by linear analysis. The metallicity gradient of SF disk gives rise\nto different properties of clouds from outer to inner part of BLRs. We find\nthat clouds have column density N_H < 10^22cm^{-2} in the metal-rich regions\nwhereas they have N_H > 10^22 cm^{-2} in the metal-poor regions. The metal-rich\nclouds compose the high ionization line (HIL) regions whereas the metal-poor\nclouds are in low ionization line (LIL) regions. Metal-rich clouds in HIL\nregions will be blown away by radiation pressure, forming the observed\noutflows.

Dark matter occupies a three-dimensional\n'sheet' of free- fall observers, non-intersecting in six-dimensional\nvelocity-position phase space. At early times, the sheet was flat like an\norigami sheet, i.e. velocities were essentially zero, but as time passes, the\nsheet folds up to form cosmic structure. The present paper further illustrates\nthis analogy, and clarifies a Lagrangian definition of caustics and streams:\ncaustics are two-dimensional surfaces in this initial sheet along which it\nfolds, tessellating Lagrangian space into a set of three-dimensional regions,\ni.e. streams. The main scientific result of the paper is that streams may be\ncolored by only two colors, with no two neighbouring streams (i.e. streams on\neither side of a caustic surface) colored the same. The two colors correspond\nto positive and negative parities of local Lagrangian volumes. This is a severe\nrestriction on the connectivity and therefore arrangement of streams in\nLagrangian space, since arbitrarily many colors can be necessary to color a\ngeneral arrangement of three-dimensional regions. This stream two-colorability\nhas consequences from graph theory, which we explain. Then, using N-body\nsimulations, we test how these caustics correspond in Lagrangian space to the\nboundaries of haloes, filaments and walls. We also test how well outer caustics\ncorrespond to a Zel'dovich-approximation prediction. \n\n"}

We study this issue in detail, particularly\nfocusing on the question: \"If future observations reveal nonzero curvature,\nwhat can we conclude?\" We find that whether an observable signal arises or not\ndepends crucially on three issues: the cosmic history just before the\nobservable inflation, the measure adopted to define probabilities, and the\nnature of the correlation between the tunneling and slow-roll parts of the\npotential. We find that if future measurements find positive curvature at\n\\Omega_k < -10^-4, then the framework of the eternally inflating multiverse is\nexcluded with high significance. If the measurements instead reveal negative\ncurvature at \\Omega_k > 10^-4, then we can conclude (1) diffusive (new or\nchaotic) eternal inflation did not occur in our immediate past; (2) our\nuniverse was born by a bubble nucleation; (3) the probability measure does not\nreward volume increase; and (4) the origin of the observed slow-roll inflation\nis an accidental feature of the potential, not due to a theoretical mechanism.\nDiscovery of \\Omega_k > 10^-4 would also give us nontrivial information about\nthe correlation between tunneling and slow-roll; e.g. a strong correlation\nfavoring large N would be excluded in certain measures.

While optics\nerrors mainly cause the PSF to vary on angular scales similar or larger than a\nsingle CCD sensor, the atmosphere generates stochastic structures on a wide\nrange of angular scales. It thus becomes a challenge to infer the multi-scale,\ncomplex atmospheric PSF patterns by interpolating the sparsely sampled stars in\nthe field. In this paper we present a new method, PSFent, for interpolating the\nPSF shape parameters, based on reconstructing underlying shape parameter maps\nwith a multi-scale maximum entropy algorithm.

This\nmodel postulates a starburst following each major merger, lasting for a time\nt_SF and converting at most f_star of galactic gas into stars. We include a\nsimple physical prescription for supernovae feedback that suppresses star\nformation in low mass galaxies. Constraining t_SF and f_star to describe the\nobserved star formation rate density at high redshifts, we find that individual\nstarbursts were terminated after a time t_SF~10^7 years. This is comparable to\nthe main-sequence lifetimes of supernova progenitors, indicating that high\nredshift starbursts are quenched once supernovae feedback had time to develop.\nHigh redshift galaxies convert ~10% of their mass into stars for galaxies with\nstar formation rates above ~1 solar mass per year, but a smaller fraction for\nlower luminosity galaxies.

Contrary to Newtonian gravity, we find the\nfifth force is repulsive in voids. The strength of the fifth force depends on\nthe density inside and outside the void region as well as its radius. It can be\nmany times larger than the Newtonian force and their ratio is in principle\nunbound. This is very different from the case in halos, where the fifth force\nis no more than 1/3 of gravity. The evolution of voids is governed by the\nNewtonian gravity, the effective dark energy force and the fifth force. While\nthe first two forces are common in both LCDM and chameleon universes, the fifth\nforce is unique to the latter. Driven by the outward-pointing fifth force,\nindividual voids in chameleon models expand faster and grow larger than in a\nLCDM universe. The expansion velocity of the void shell can be 20% to 30%\nlarger for voids of a few Mpc/h in radius, while their sizes can be larger by\n~10%. These differences are smaller for larger voids of the same density. We\ncompare void statistics using excursion set theory; for voids of the same size,\ntheir number density is larger in chameleon models. The fractional difference\nincreases with void size. The chance of having voids of radius ~25 Mpc/h can be\n2.5 times larger. This difference is about 10 times larger than that in the\nhalo mass function. We find strong environmental dependence of void properties\nin chameleon models. The differences in size and expansion velocity with GR are\nboth larger for small voids in high density regions.

We propose that the entropy profiles could be used to study\ncosmic-ray (CR) acceleration around the clusters. If the CRs are effectively\naccelerated at the formation of clusters, the kinetic energy of infalling gas\nis consumed by the acceleration and the gas entropy should decrease. As a\nresult, the entropy profiles become flat at the outskirts. If the acceleration\nis not efficient, the entropy should continue to increase outwards. By\ncomparing model predictions with X-ray observations with Suzaku, which show\nflat entropy profiles, we find that the CRs have carried ~<7% of the kinetic\nenergy of the gas away from the clusters. Moreover, the CR pressure at the\noutskirts can be ~<40% of the total pressure. On the other hand, if the entropy\nprofiles are not flat at the outskirts as indicated by combined Plank and ROSAT\nobservations, the carried energy and the CR pressure should be much smaller\nthan the above estimations. \n\n"}

It is argued that the recently\nobserved broadening of the radio spectra and/or light curves in some of the\ntype Ib/c supernovae is a direct indication of inhomogeneities. As compared to\na homogeneous source, this increases the deduced velocity of the forward shock\nand the observed correlation between total energy and shock velocity could in\npart be due to a varying covering factor. The X-ray emission from at least some\ntype Ib/c supernovae is unlikely to be synchrotron radiation from an electron\ndistribution accelerated in a non-linear shock. Instead it is shown that the\nobserved correlation during the first few hundred days between the radio, X-ray\nand bolometric luminosities indicates that the X-ray emission is inverse\nCompton scattering of the photospheric photons.

We report simulations of the inspiral of binary neutron\nstars in quasi-circular orbits computed with a new code employing high-order,\nhigh-resolution shock-capturing, finite-differencing schemes that, for the\nfirst time, go beyond the second-order barrier. In particular, without any\ntuning or alignment, we measure a convergence order above three both in the\nphase and in the amplitude of the gravitational waves. Because the new code is\nable to calculate waveforms with very small phase errors already at modest\nresolutions, we are able to obtain accurate estimates of tidal effects in the\ninspiral that are essentially free from the large numerical viscosity typical\nof lower-order methods, and even for the challenging large compactness and\nsmall-deformability binary considered here. We find a remarkable agreement\nbetween our Richardson-extrapolated waveform and the one from the tidally\ncorrected post-Newtonian (PN) Taylor-T4 model, with a de-phasing smaller than\n0.2 radians during the seven orbits of the inspiral and up to the contact\npoint. Because our results can be used reliably to assess the validity of the\nPN or other approximations at frequencies significantly larger than those\nconsidered so far in the literature, they seem to exclude at these\ncompactnesses significant tidal amplifications from\nnext-to-next-to-leading--order terms in the PN expansion. \n\n"}

Our\nmain results are: a) The stellar-to-halo mass ratio is ~0.01 and remains\nroughly constant since z~1 (the stellar MAHs follow closely the halo MAHs),\nwith a smaller value at higher z's for those halos that assemble their mass\nlater. b) The evolution of the galaxy gas fraction, fg, is episodic and higher,\nmost of the time, than the stellar fraction. When fg decreases (increases), the\ngas fraction in the halo typically increases (decreases), showing that the SN\ndriven outflows play an important role in regulating the gas fractions -and\nhence the SFR- of the dwarfs.

Notably, massive red sequence early-type galaxies\n(stellar masses > 5e10 Msun, derived from dynamical models) are found to have\nHI masses up to M(HI)/Mstar ~ 0.06 and H_2 masses up to M(H$_2$)/Mstar ~ 0.01.\nSome 20% of all massive early-type galaxies may have retained atomic and/or\nmolecular gas through their transition to the red sequence. However, kinematic\nand metallicity signatures of external gas accretion (either from satellite\ngalaxies or the intergalactic medium) are also common, particularly at stellar\nmasses <= 5e10 Msun, where such signatures are found in ~ 50% of H$_2$-rich\nearly-type galaxies.

We show that the green valley between the\nblue cloud of star-forming galaxies and the red sequence of quiescent galaxies\nin the colour-mass diagram is not a single transitional state through which\nmost blue galaxies evolve into red galaxies. Rather, an analysis that takes\nmorphology into account makes clear that only a small population of blue\nearly-type galaxies move rapidly across the green valley after the morphologies\nare transformed from disk to spheroid and star formation is quenched rapidly.\nIn contrast, the majority of blue star-forming galaxies have significant disks,\nand they retain their late-type morphologies as their star formation rates\ndecline very slowly. We summarize a range of observations that lead to these\nconclusions, including UV-optical colours and halo masses, which both show a\nstriking dependence on morphological type. We interpret these results in terms\nof the evolution of cosmic gas supply and gas reservoirs. We conclude that\nlate-type galaxies are consistent with a scenario where the cosmic supply of\ngas is shut off, perhaps at a critical halo mass, followed by a slow exhaustion\nof the remaining gas over several Gyr, driven by secular and/or environmental\nprocesses.

All models predict on average longer orbital periods\nfor PCEBs containing C/O-core WDs than for PCEBs containing He WDs. This effect\nincreases with increasing values of both efficiencies. Longer periods after the\nCE phase are also predicted for systems containing more massive secondary\nstars.

The precise nature\nof the progenitor, however, remains debated owing to spectral ambiguities\narising from a strong contribution from the CSM interaction. Late-time spectra\noffer potential insight if the post-shock cold, dense shell becomes\nsufficiently thin and/or the ejecta begin to cross the reverse shock. To date,\nfew high-quality spectra of this kind exist. Here we report on the late-time\noptical and infrared spectra of the SNe~Ia-CSM 2012ca and 2013dn. These SNe\nIa-CSM spectra exhibit low [Fe III]/[Fe II] ratios and strong [Ca II] at late\nepochs. Such characteristics are reminiscent of the super-Chandrasekhar-mass\n(SC) candidate SN 2009dc, for which these features suggested a low-ionisation\nstate due to high densities, although the broad Fe features admittedly show\nsimilarities to the blue \"quasi-continuum\" observed in some core-collapse SNe\nIbn and IIn. Neither SN 2012ca nor any of the other SNe Ia-CSM show evidence\nfor broad oxygen, carbon, or magnesium in their spectra.

The total bolometric energy output does not exceed\n10^51 erg, but does require a large kinetic-to-radiative conversion efficiency.\nAll of these observations taken together suggest that SNe Ia-CSM are more\nconsistent with a thermonuclear explosion than a core-collapse event, although\ndetailed radiative transfer models are certainly necessary to confirm these\nresults. \n\n"}

Usually a\nminimum value of the Lorentz factor of the relativistic bulk motion is obtained\nbased on the argument that the observed high energy photons ($\\gg {\\rm MeV}$)\ncan escape without suffering from absorption due to pair production. The exact\nvalue, rather than a lower limit, of the Lorentz factor can be obtained if the\nspectral cutoff due to such absorption is detected. With the good spectral\ncoverage of the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on \\textsl{Fermi}, measurements of\nsuch cutoff become possible, and two cases (GRB~090926A and GRB~100724B) have\nbeen reported to have high-energy cutoffs or breaks. We systematically search\nfor such high energy spectral cutoffs/breaks from the LAT and the Gamma-ray\nburst monitor (GBM) observations of the prompt emission of GRBs detected since\nAugust 2011.

The bispectrum shapes predicted for generic\nnon-Bunch-Davies initial states are non-factorizable (\"non-separable\") and are\nhighly oscillatory functions of the three constituent wavenumbers. This can\nmake the computation of CMB bispectra, in particular, computationally\nintractable.

In this paper we consider a variety of inflationary scenarios,\nwith different non-standard initial conditions, and how best to construct\nviable template matches. In addition to implementing commonly used separable\npolynomial and Fourier bases, we introduce a basis of localized piecewise\nspline functions. The spline basis is naturally nearly orthogonal, making it\neasy to implement and to extend to many modes. We show that, in comparison to\nexisting techniques, the spline basis can provide better fits to the true\nbispectrum, as measured by the cosine between shapes, for sectors of the theory\nspace of general initial states. As such, it offers a useful approach to\ninvestigate non-trivial features generated by fundamental properties of the\ninflationary Universe. \n\n"}

Abstract: The amount of dust estimated from infrared to sub-millimetre (submm)\nobservations strongly depends on assumptions of different grain sizes,\ncompositions and optical properties. Here we use a simple model of thermal\nemission from cold silicate/carbon dust at a range of dust grain temperatures\nand fit the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the Crab Nebula as a test.\nThis can lower the derived dust mass for the Crab by ~50% and 30-40% for\nastronomical silicates and amorphous carbon grains compared to recently\npublished values (0.25M_sun -> 0.12M_sun and 0.12M_sun -> 0.072M_sun,\nrespectively), but the implied dust mass can also increase by as much as almost\na factor of six (0.25M_sun -> 1.14M_sun and 0.12M_sun -> 0.71M_sun) depending\non assumptions regarding the sizes/temperatures of the coldest grains. The\nlatter values are clearly unrealistic due to the expected metal budget, though.\nFurthermore, we show by a simple numerical experiment that if a cold-dust\ncomponent does have a grain-temperature distribution, it is almost unavoidable\nthat a two-temperature fit will yield an incorrect dust mass estimate. But we\nconclude that grain temperatures is not a greater uncertainty than the often\npoorly constrained emissivities (i.e., material properties) of cosmic dust,\nalthough there is clearly a need for improved dust emission models. The\ngreatest complication associated with deriving dust masses still arises in the\nuncertainty in the dust composition. \n\n"}

We aim to find\nbinary-evolution mechanisms that can explain these eccentric long-period\norbits, and reproduce the currently observed period-eccentricity diagram. Three\ndifferent processes are considered; tidally-enhanced wind mass-loss,\nphase-dependent RLOF on eccentric orbits and the interaction between a\ncircumbinary disk and the binary. The binary module of the stellar-evolution\ncode MESA (Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics) is extended to\ninclude the eccentricity-pumping processes. The effects of different input\nparameters on the final period and eccentricity of a binary-evolution model are\ntested with MESA. The end products of models with only tidally-enhanced wind\nmass-loss can indeed be eccentric, but these models need to lose too much mass,\nand invariably end up with a helium white dwarf that is too light to ignite\nhelium. Within the tested parameter space, no sdBs in eccentric systems are\nformed. Phase-dependent RLOF can reintroduce eccentricity during RLOF, and\ncould help to populate the short-period part of the period-eccentricity\ndiagram. When phase-dependent RLOF is combined with eccentricity pumping via a\ncircumbinary disk, the higher eccentricities can be reached as well.

While we know the growth rate the magnetic energy\nin the linear regime, the saturation level, i.e. the ratio of magnetic energy\nto turbulent kinetic energy that can be reached, is not known from analytical\ncalculations. In this paper we present the first scale-dependent saturation\nmodel based on an effective turbulent resistivity which is determined by the\nturnover timescale of turbulent eddies and the magnetic energy density.

We first extend\nthe kinetic theory of Gilbert (1968) to include the Keplerian field of a black\nhole of mass $M_\\bullet$. Specializing to a Keplerian stellar system of mass $M\n\\ll M_\\bullet$, we use the orbit-averaging method of Sridhar & Touma (2015;\nPaper I) to derive a kinetic equation for RR. This describes the collisional\nevolution of a system of $N \\gg 1$ Gaussian Rings in a reduced 5-dim space,\nunder the combined actions of self-gravity, 1 PN and 1.5 PN relativistic\neffects of the MBH and an arbitrary external potential. In general geometries\nRR is driven by both apsidal and nodal resonances, so the distinction between\nscalar-RR and vector-RR disappears. The system passes through a sequence of\nquasi-steady secular collisionless equilibria, driven by irreversible 2-Ring\ncorrelations that accrue through gravitational interactions, both direct and\ncollective. This correlation function is related to a `wake function', which is\nthe linear response of the system to the perturbation of a chosen Ring.

Whereas for bright sources above the so called critical luminosity\nthese variations are established to be connected with the appearance of the\nhigh accretion column above the neutron star surface, at low, sub-critical\nluminosities the nature of the variations (but with the opposite sign) has not\nbeen discussed widely.

The position of the\ncyclotron resonance is determined by the Doppler effect. The change of the\ncyclotron line position in the spectrum with luminosity is caused by variations\nof the velocity profile in the line-forming region affected by the radiation\npressure force.

Upon its destruction, a fraction of this energy is extracted\nand injected into the stellar debris, half of which becomes unbound from the\nblack hole, with the fastest material moving at $\\sim 0.03 c$. In this paper,\nwe present a formalism for determining the fate of these unbound debris streams\n(UDSs) as they depart from the black hole and interact with the surrounding\ngas. As the density and velocity varies along the length of a UDS, we find that\nhydrodynamical drag quickly shapes UDSs into loop-like structures, with the\ndensest portions of the streams leading portions of lower density. As UDSs\ntravel outwards, their drag against the ISM increases quadratically with\ndistance, which causes UDSs to deposit their momentum and energy into the\nambient medium before the surrounding shocked ISM has a chance to cool. This\nsudden injection of $\\sim 10^{50}$ erg into the ambient medium generates a\nSedov-like unbound debris remnant (UDR) that mimics supernova remnants (SNRs)\nin energetics and appearance, accelerates particles which will produce cosmic\nrays and synchrotron emission, and provides momentum feedback into the\nmolecular clouds surrounding a black hole.

We impose either a vertical or a\nhorizontal uniform magnetic field in a convection-driven turbulent flow.\nResults: We find that super-equipartition magnetic flux concentrations are\nformed near the surface with domain depths of $12.5$ and $24$ Mm. The size of\nthe concentrations increases as the box size increases and the largest\nstructures ($20$ Mm horizontally) are obtained in the 24 Mm deep models. The\nfield strength in the concentrations is in the range of $3$-$5$ kG. The\nconcentrations grow approximately linearly in time. The effective magnetic\npressure measured in the simulations is positive near the surface and negative\nin the bulk of the convection zone.

One plausible mechanism explaining both the\nlinear growth and the concentrate on of the flux in the regions of converging\nflow pattern is flux expulsion. Possible reasons for the absence of NEMPI are\nthat the derivative of the effective magnetic pressure with respect to the mean\nmagnetic field has an unfavourable sign and that there may not be sufficient\nscale separation. \n\n"}

Here, the mathematical correspondence\nbetween the KD and a specific stochastic differential equation (SDE) viewed\nfrom the perspective of the supersymmetric theory of stochastics (STS) is\ndiscussed. The STS is a novel, approximation-free framework to investigate\nSDEs. The correspondence reported here permits insights from the STS to be\napplied to the theory of KD and vice versa. It was previously known that the\nfast KD in the idealistic limit of no magnetic diffusion requires chaotic\nflows. The KD-STS correspondence shows that this is also true for the diffusive\nKD. From the STS perspective, the KD possesses a topological supersymmetry and\nthe dynamo effect can be viewed as its spontaneous breakdown.

The problem\naddressed by the resolution is a lack of established conversion constants\nbetween solar and planetary values and SI units: a missing standard has caused\na proliferation of solar values (e.g., solar radius, solar irradiance, solar\nluminosity, solar effective temperature and solar mass parameter) in the\nliterature, with cited solar values typically based on best estimates at the\ntime of paper writing. As precision of observations increases, a set of\nconsistent values becomes increasingly important.

We implement here an integrated scheme for\ncosmological probes, which are combined in a common framework starting at the\nmap level. This treatment is necessary as the probes are generally derived from\noverlapping maps and are thus not independent. It also allows for a thorough\ntest of the cosmological model and of systematics through the consistency of\ndifferent physical tracers. As a first application, we combine current\nmeasurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) from the Planck\nsatellite, and galaxy clustering and weak lensing from SDSS. We consider the\nspherical harmonic power spectra of these probes including all six auto- and\ncross-correlations along with the associated full Gaussian covariance matrix.\nThis provides an integrated treatment of different analyses usually performed\nseparately including CMB anisotropies, cosmic shear, galaxy clustering,\ngalaxy-galaxy lensing and the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect with galaxy\nand shear tracers.

This ultralight mode\nfreezes on super-horizon scales and acts as a constant source for the curvature\nperturbation, making it grow linearly in time and effectively suppressing the\nisocurvature component. We identify a Stuckelberg-like emergent shift symmetry\nthat underlies this behavior.

The physical conditions for\ngrain evolution are taken from hydrodynamical simulations of giant molecular\nclouds in a Milky Way-like spiral galaxy. We improve the treatment of dust\ngrowth by accretion in the ISM to investigate the role of the\ntemperature-dependent sticking coefficient and ion-grain interactions. From\ndetailed observational data on the gas-phase Si abundances [Si/H]_{gas}\nmeasured in the local Galaxy, we derive a relation between the average\n[Si/H]_{gas} and the local gas density n(H) which we use as a critical\nconstraint for the models. This relation requires a sticking coefficient that\ndecreases with the gas temperature. The synthetic relation constructed from the\nspatial dust distribution reproduces the slope of -0.5 of the observed relation\nin cold clouds. This slope is steeper than that for the warm medium and is\nexplained by the dust growth. We find that it occurs for all adopted values of\nthe minimum grain size a_{min} from 1 to 5nm. For the classical cut-off of\na_{min}=5 nm, the ion-grain interactions result in longer growth timescales and\nhigher [Si/H]_{gas} than the observed values.

The\nrates of dust re-formation in the ISM by far exceed the rates of dust\nproduction by stellar sources as expected from simple evolution models.

Even then, the theory space is described in terms of a handful of free\nfunctions of time. This needs to be reduced to a finite number of parameters to\nbe practical for cosmological surveys. We explore in this article how well\nsimple parametrizations, with a small number of parameters, can fit observables\ncomputed from complex theories. Imposing the stability of linear perturbations\nappreciably reduces the theory space we explore. We find that observables are\nnot extremely sensitive to short time-scale variations and that simple, smooth\nparametrizations are usually sufficient to describe this theory space. Using\nthe Bayesian Information Criterion, we find that using two parameters for each\nfunction (an amplitude and a power law index) is preferred over complex models\nfor 86% of our theory space. \n\n"}

We use this observation to\nplace constraints on the density profile of dwarf spheroidal galaxies under the\nassumption that the galactic center excess is in fact a signal from\nannihilating dark matter.

Depending on the compactness of the central object, the\nneutrino self-interaction potential is up to three times as large as that\nwithout GR principally due to trajectory bending which increases the\nintersection angles between different neutrino trajectories, and time dilation\nwhich changes the fluxes. We determine whether GR effects are important for\nflavor transformation during the different epochs of a supernova by using\nmulti-angle flavor transformation calculations and consider a density profile\nand neutrino spectra representative of both the accretion and cooling phases.\nWe find the GR effects are smaller during the accretion phase due to low\ncompactness of the proto-neutron star and merely delay the decoherence; the\nneutrino bipolar oscillations during the cooling phase are also delayed due to\nthe GR effects but the delay may be more important because the delay occurs at\nradii where it might alter the nucleosynthesis in the neutrino driven wind. \n\n"}

We study the age distributions of clusters in smoothed particle\nhydrodynamics simulations of isolated disc galaxies, which include a\nself-consistent, physical model for the formation and dynamical evolution of\nthe cluster population and account for the variation of cluster disruption in\ntime and space. We show that the downward slope of the cluster age distribution\ndue to disruption cannot be reproduced with a single functional form, because\nthe disruption rate exhibits systematic trends with cluster age (the `cruel\ncradle effect'). This problem is resolved by using the median cluster age to\ntrace cluster disruption. Across 120 independent galaxy snapshots and simulated\ncluster populations, we perform two-dimensional power law fits of the median\ncluster age to various macroscopic physical quantities and find that it scales\nas $t_{\\rm med}\\propto \\Sigma^{-0.51\\pm0.03}\\sigma_{\\rm\n1D}^{-0.85\\pm0.10}M_{\\rm min}^\\gamma$, for the gas surface density $\\Sigma$,\ngas velocity dispersion $\\sigma_{\\rm 1D}$, and minimum cluster mass $M_{\\rm\nmin}$.

It has been suggested recently that a\nHe-rich WD (a He WD or a hybrid HeCO WD) merges with a CO WD may produce an SN\nIa. This theory was based on the double-detonation model, in which the shock\ncompression in the CO core caused by the surface explosion of the He-rich shell\nmight lead to the explosion of the whole CO WD.

To clarify these issues, we use a hydrodynamic\nsimulation of an isolated disc galaxy with a spatial resolution of a few tens\nparsecs. The evolution of dust abundance and grain size distribution is treated\nconsistently with the metal enrichment and the physical state of the\ninterstellar medium.

The disk in such systems is twisted/warped due to the gravitational\ntorques from the oblate central star and the external companion. We calculate\nthe disk warp profile, taking into account of bending wave propagation and\nviscosity in the disk. We show that for typical protostellar disk parameters,\nthe disk warp is small, thereby justifying the \"flat-disk\" approximation\nadopted in previous theoretical studies. However, the viscous dissipation\nassociated with the small disk warp/twist tends to drive the disk toward\nalignment with the binary or the central star. We calculate the relevant\ntimescales for the alignment. We find the alignment is effective for\nsufficiently cold disks with strong external torques, especially for systems\nwith rapidly rotating stars, but is ineffective for the majority of\nstar-disk-binary systems. Viscous warp driven alignment may be necessary to\naccount for the observed spin-orbit alignment in multi-planet systems if these\nsystems are accompanied by an inclined binary companion. \n\n"}

Hydrodynamical simulations undertaken to explore our scenario show\nthat supermassive, gravitationally bound gaseous disks, weighing a billion\nsolar masses and of a few pc in size, form in the nuclei of merger remnants in\nless than $10^5$ yr. These could later produce a supermassive protostar or\nsupermassive star at their center via various mechanisms. Moreover, we present\na new analytical model, based on angular momentum transport in mass-loaded\ngravitoturbulent disks. This naturally predicts that a nuclear disk accreting\nat rates exceeding $1000 M_{\\odot}$/yr, as seen in the simulations, is stable\nagainst fragmentation irrespective of its metallicity.

The ultraluminous Type IIn supernova SN 2010jl\nexhibits an infrared emission component that is in excess of the extrapolated\nUV-optical spectrum as early as a few weeks post-explosion. This emission has\nbeen attributed by some as evidence for rapid formation of dust in the cooling\npostshock CSM. We investigate the physical processes that may inhibit or\nfacilitate the formation of dust in the CSM. When only radiative cooling is\nconsidered, the temperature of the dense shocked gas rapidly drops below the\ndust condensation temperature. However, by accounting for the heating of the\npostshock gas by the downstream radiation from the shock, we show that dust\nformation is inhibited until the radiation from the shock weakens, as the shock\npropagates into the less dense outer regions of the CSM. In SN 2010jl dust\nformation can therefore only commence after day 380. Only the IR emission since\nthat epoch can be attributed to the newly formed CSM dust.

Such\npotentials are fundamental in potential theory. They appear in spherically\nsymmetrical systems formed by a large amount of charges (electrical or\ngravitational) of the same type considered in mean-field theory.

The photometric cycle amplitudes are on average six times larger for the\nactive stars. The phase and amplitude information demonstrates that active\nstars are dominated by dark spots, whereas less active stars are dominated by\nbright faculae. We find the transition from spot to faculae domination at the\nVaughan-Preston gap, and around a Rossby number equal to one. We conclude that\nfaculae are the dominant ingredient of stellar activity cycles at ages >2.55\nGyr. The data further suggest that the Vaughan-Preston gap can not explain the\npreviously detected dearth of Kepler rotation periods between 15-25 days.\nNevertheless, our results led us to propose an explanation for the rotation\nperiod dearth to be due to the non-detection of periodicity caused by the\ncancellation of dark spots and bright faculae at 800 Myr. \n\n"}

We have used mid-infrared data from the Wide-field\nInfrared Survey Explorer (WISE) catalogue to search for the host galaxies of 65\nstrongly-scintillating MWA sources and compare their properties with those of\nthe overall population of bright low-frequency radio sources. We identified\nWISE mid-infrared counterparts for 91% of the bright sources in a single 900\nsquare degree MWA field, and found that the hosts of the strongly-scintillating\nsources were typically at least 1 mag fainter in the WISE W1 (3.4 micron) band\nthan the hosts of weakly-scintillating MWA sources of similar radio flux\ndensity. This difference arises mainly because the strongly-scintillating\nsources are more distant.

These models are characterised by a cutoff in the linear power\nspectrum, followed by a series of 'dark acoustic oscillations' (DAOs) on\nsub-dwarf scales. While the primordial cutoff delays the formation of the first\ngalaxies, structure builds-up more rapidly in the interacting DM model compared\nto CDM.

During the GRB\nprompt phase, some dissipation processes may happen and disturb the magnetic\nfield, making the field become random to some extent. Therefore, a mixed\nmagnetic field consisting of an ordered component and a random component is\nplausible for the early afterglow phase. Here we investigate the polarization\nevolution and light curve of an afterglow under such a 3-dimensional mixed\nmagnetic field. Three kinds of ordered component (i.e., aligned, toroidal and\nradial) are discussed. We find that the three cases are distinguishable through\njet polarization evolution. The polarization angle for a 3D mixed magnetic\nfield with an aligned ordered component can evolve gradually but only changes\nabruptly by $90^\\circ$ in the toroidal and radial cases. Furthermore, during\nthe reverse shock crossing time, the polarization degree (PD) can be non-zero\nfor the toroidal case but roughly zero for the radial case. Since an aligned\ncomponent in a jet corresponds to a magnetar central engine and a toroidal\ncomponent corresponds to a black hole, GRB central engines are distinguishable\nthrough polarization observations even if the magnetic field is mixed in a jet.\nIn addition, our polarization calculation can be applied to GRB 170817A\nassociated with GW170817.

Furthermore, we model the\nprocesses of cosmic-ray transport into the halo with the 1D SPINNAKER model.\nThe extended radio halo of NGC 4666 is box-shaped and is probably produced by\nthe previously observed supernova-driven superwind. This is supported by our\nfinding of an advective cosmic-ray transport such as that expected for a\ngalactic wind. The scaleheight analysis revealed an asymmetric halo above and\nbelow the disk as well as between the two sides of the major axis.

We explore a variety of approaches for modelling the\nradial distribution of the cold neutral gas associated with the galaxies in our\nmodels, and find that our results are very sensitive to this ingredient. If we\nuse an approach based on Fall & Efstathiou (1980), in which the sizes of the\ndiscs are determined by conservation of angular momentum, we find that the\nmajority of the DLAS correspond to a single galactic disc. These models\ngenerically fail to reproduce the observed distribution of velocity widths. In\nalternative models in which the gas discs are considerably more extended, a\nsignificant fraction of DLAS arise from lines of sight intersecting multiple\ngas discs in a common halo.

In\nparticular, we discuss the possible scatter in the data and argue that LiBeB\nproduction in the very early Galaxy was probably bimodal, with isolated\nsupernovae giving rise to a low-efficiency mechanism, and collective supernovae\nexploding in an OB association inducing a high-efficiency mechanism.

We use already completed cosmological simulations, to which\nwe add dust assuming that most dust can reach the equilibrium point between\nradiation pressure and gravitational forces. We find that the expulsion of dust\nand its subsequent (partial) destruction in the IGM can plausibly account for\nthe observed level of C and Si enrichment of the z=3 IGM. At low-z, dust\nejection and destruction could explain a substantial fraction of the metals in\nclusters, but it cannot account for all of the chemical species observed. Dust\nexpelled by radiation pressure could give clusters a visual opacity of up to\n0.2-0.5 mag in their central regions even after destruction by the hot\nintracluster medium; this value is interestingly close to limits and claimed\nobservations of cluster extinction.

The secondary star is a late B-type star\nwhich has evolved off the main sequence. Using a moderate resolution spectrum\n(R=7000) we measure T_eff=10500 +/- 200K, log(g)=3.5 +/- 0.1, and\nV_rot*sin(i)=123 +/- 4 km/sec (1 sigma errors).

The lack of X-ray eclipses implies an upper\nlimit to the inclination of i<70.7 deg. On the other hand, the large amplitude\nof the folded light curve (about 0.5 mag) implies a large inclination (i>60\ndeg). Using the above mass function, mass ratio, and inclination range, the\nmass of the compact object is in the range 8.73 < M_1 < 11.70 solar masses and\nthe mass of the secondary star is in the range 5.49 < M_2 < 8.14 solar masses\n(90% confidence).

This capability is crucial,\nfor example, to accurately measure proper motions of bright stars in nearby\ngalaxies. From such measurements, one can obtain distance estimates, explore\nthe dynamics of these systems and measure the mass of the Milky Way itself. In\nthis paper we investigate errors introduced by confusion, i.e. the presence of\nobjects other than the targeted star in the SIM field of view (FOV). Using\nexisting HST images of fields in M31, the LMC and the Galaxy we simulate the\nbackground within the SIM FOV and estimate the errors in the measured position\nof the target star. Our simulations account for the error contribution from\nphoton statistics. We also study the effects of pointing imperfections when a\nfield is revisited which result in errors in the measured proper motion. We use\nthe simulations to explore the measurement accuracy of several SIM key programs\nwhich will require crowded field astrometry.

Abstract: Using the NASA Extragalactic Database, we have searched the close environment\nof 98 star-forming dwarf galaxies (SFDGs) from field- and low density\nenvironments for companion galaxies. Most of the found companions are dwarf\ngalaxies, previously disregarded in environmental studies of SFDGs. Using a\nsubsample at low redshifts, cz < 2000 km/s, i.e. less biased against dwarf\ncompanions, we find that 30% of the SFDGs have close companions within a\nprojected linear separation s_p < 100 kpc and a redshift difference of (Delta\ncz) < 500 km/s. This fraction must be considered a lower limit, given the\nincompleteness of the available data sets and the non-negligible frequency of\nHI clouds in the vicinity of SFDGs, so that the majority of SFDGs should not be\nconsidered isolated. The redshift differences between companion candidates and\nsample SFDGs are typically smaller than ~250 km/s and concentrated towards\nlower values.

Calibrating the models on galactic globular\nclusters, we show that any population synthesis model being based on stellar\nlibraries of the Milky Way is intrinsically biased towards super-solar alpha/Fe\nratios at metallicities below solar. We correct for this bias, so that the\nmodels presented here reflect constant alpha/Fe ratios at all metallicities.\nThe use of such unbiased models is essential for studies of stellar systems\nwith sub-solar metallicities like (extragalactic) globular clusters or dwarf\ngalaxies.\n  For the galaxy sample investigated here, we find a clear correlation between\nalpha/Fe and velocity dispersion. Zero-point, slope, and scatter of this\ncorrelation turn out to be independent of the environment. Additionally, the\nalpha/Fe ratios and mean ages of elliptical galaxies are well correlated, i.e.\ngalaxies with high alpha/Fe ratios have also high average ages.

This may be a valuable clue\ntoward understanding the connection between the burst and afterglow phases of\nthese events. The relation is roughly linear (i.e. doubling the pulse lag in\nturn doubles the jet break time) and thus implies a simple relationship between\nthese quantities. We suggest that this correlation is due to variation among\nbursts of emitter Doppler factor. Specifically, an increased speed or decreased\nangle of velocity, with respect to the observed line-of-site, of burst ejecta\nwill result in shorter perceived pulse lags in GRBs as well as quicker\nevolution of the external shock of the afterglow to the time when the jet\nbecomes obvious, i.e. the jet-break time.

At z >~ 3 the deficiencies are\ninstead small, suggestive of a soft, stellar-type spectrum, though more data\nare needed to generalize this high-z result. We argue that the change of Ar\nabundances is induced by the evolution of the UV metagalactic continuum, in\nwhich case the UV emission internal to DLAs must be small (i.e. DLAs should\nhave modest star formation rates) and the external background must become\nsofter at z > 3.

Hence we postulate that the H_2\nemission originates where the stellar wind (with an observed terminal velocity\nof +/- 126 km/s) is funneled through an equatorial density enhancement,\nimpinging almost tangentially upon the circumstellar material. The [Fe II]\nemission either occurs along the walls of the bipolar lobes where the\ntransverse shock velocity would be higher, or could originate much closer to\nthe central star in shocks in the post-AGB wind itself, or possibly even an\naccretion disk.

We demonstrate that\nthe luminosity of diffuse X-ray emission in both disk and halo is directly\nproportional to the rate of mechanical energy feedback from massive stars.\nNevertheless, with only three non-starburst normal spiral galaxies it is hard\nto exclude an accretion-based origin for extra-planar diffuse X-ray emission\naround normal star-forming galaxies. Larger galaxies have more extended\nX-ray-emitting halos, but galaxy mass appears to play no role in determining\nthe properties of the disk or extra-planar X-ray emitting plasma. The\ncombination of these luminosity and size correlations leads to a correlation\nbetween the surface brightness of the diffuse X-ray emission and the mean star\nformation rate per unit area in the disk (L_FIR/D_25^2).

The galaxies were selected primarily because they appear to have\nelongated morphologies, and slits were aligned with the major axes (as\ndetermined from the rest-frame UV emission) of 11 of the 13. If the galaxies\nare elongated because they are highly inclined, alignment of the slit and major\naxis should maximize the observed velocity and reveal velocity shear, if\npresent. In spite of this alignment, we see spatially resolved velocity shear\nin only two galaxies. We show that the seeing makes a large difference in the\nobserved velocity spread of a tilted emission line, and use this information to\nplace limits on the velocity spread of the ionized gas of the galaxies in the\nsample: we find that all 13 have v_{0.5} < 110 km/s, where v_{0.5} is the\nvelocity shear (half of the velocity range of a tilted emission line) that\nwould be observed under our best seeing conditions of ~0.5\". When combined with\nprevious work, our data also indicate that aligning the slit along the major\naxis does not increase the probability of observing a tilted emission line. We\nthen focus on the one-dimensional velocity dispersion \\sigma, which is much\nless affected by the seeing, and see that the elongated subsample exhibits a\nsignificantly lower velocity dispersion than galaxies selected at random from\nour total H-alpha sample, not higher as one might have expected. We also see\nsome evidence that the elongated galaxies are less reddened than those randomly\nselected using only UV colors. Both of these results are counter to what would\nbe expected if the elongated galaxies were highly inclined disks. It is at\nleast as likely that the galaxies' elongated morphologies are due to merging\nsubunits. \n\n"}

There are two classes of models. In the first class\nthe universe is presently in a metastable vacuum and will continue to inflate\nuntil tunneling processes eventually induce a first order transition. In the\nsimplest such model, the range of the new force is bounded to be larger than 25\nmicrons in the absence of fine-tuning of parameters, and for couplings of order\nunity it is expected to be \\approx 100 microns.

The interior\nfilaments have higher [S II]/Halpha ratios and form an apparent inner shell\nmorphology. The X-ray emission region is smaller than the full extent of the\noptical shell, with the brightest X-ray emission found within the small\ninterior shell and on the western rim of the large shell. The expansion\nvelocity of the small shell is ~220 km/s, while the large shell is ~120 km/s.\n  The radio image shows central brightening and a fairly flat radio spectral\nindex over the SNR. However, no point X-ray or radio source corresponding to a\npulsar is detected and the X-ray emission is predominantly thermal.

Alfven, slow and fast modes of MHD turbulence\nfollow their own cascades and exhibit degrees of anisotropy consistent with\ntheoretical expectations.

When these sources were\nin the high gamma-ray intensity state (gamma-2, for Cygnus X-1), their spectra\nfeatured two components: a Comptonized shape below 200-300 keV with a soft\npower-law tail (photon index >3) that extended to ~1 MeV or beyond. When the\nsources were in the low-intensity state (gamma-0, for Cygnus X-1), the\nComptonized spectral shape below 200 keV typically vanished and the entire\nspectrum from 30 keV to ~1 MeV can be characterized by a single power law with\na relatively harder photon index ~2-2.7.

The density profiles of the simulated clusters\nclosely follow the NFW form, but we find that the recovered values of the inner\nslope are systematically underestimated, by about 0.4 in the mean, if the lens\nis assumed to be axially symmetric. However, if the ellipticity and orientation\nof the iso-contours of the cluster lensing potential are taken into account,\nthen the inner slopes can be recovered quite accurately for a significant\nsubset of the clusters whose central surface density profiles appear the most\nregular. These have lensing potentials with ellipticities in the range\n0.15-0.4. Further simulations projecting one cluster along many random\nlines-of-sight show that, even for lower ellipticities, the central slopes are\nunderestimated by $\\sim 10-35%$.

For the remaining\nclusters, where the lensing potential is strongly perturbed by active merging\nor by substructure, the correct determination of the inner slope requires a\nmore accurate model for the lens. When the halo profile is modelled by a\ngeneralised NFW profile, we find that the inferred scale radius and\ncharacteristic density, unlike the inner slope, are generally poorly\nconstrained, since there is a strong degeneracy between these two parameters. \n\n"}

Molecular clouds are now believed to be transient objects\nthat form on timescales of order 1e7 yrs in regions where HI gas is compressed\nand cools.

The observed periodicity\nof 3.62 hr is interpreted as the orbital period of the system. It has been\nsuggested that the system is a low-mass helium star with a lower-mass compact\ncompanion.

The binary is in a state of mass transfer\nphase which is initiated when the helium-star donor is on the helium shell\nburning stage.

Dynamical Interaction\n  between Binaries and an Intermediate Mass Black Hole Abstract: We present the first study of the dynamical evolution of an isolated star\ncluster that combines a significant population of primordial binaries with the\npresence of a central black hole. We use equal-mass direct N-body simulations,\nwith N ranging from 4096 to 16384 and a primordial binary ratio of 0-10%; the\nblack hole mass is about one percent of the total mass of the cluster. The\nevolution of the binary population is strongly influenced by the presence of\nthe black hole, which gives the cluster a large core with a central density\ncusp. Starting from a variety of initial conditions (Plummer and King models),\nwe first encounter a phase, that last approximately 10 half-mass relaxation\ntimes, in which binaries are disrupted faster compared to analogous simulations\nwithout a black hole. Subsequently, however, binary disruption slows down\nsignificantly, due to the large core size. The dynamical interplay between the\nprimordial binaries and the black hole thus introduces new features with\nrespect to the scenarios investigated so far, where the influence of the black\nhole and of the binaries have been considered separately. A large core to half\nmass radius ratio appears to be a promising indirect evidence for the presence\nof a intermediate-mass black hole in old globular clusters. \n\n"}

We also assume that the azimuthal velocity in the disk is\nconstant: $v_\\phi = Mc$, where $M<1$ is a constant. For each choice of the\nparameters $\\nu$ and $M$, we find an infinite number of solutions that are\nphysically well-behaved and have fluid velocity $\\leq c$ throughout the domain\nof interest. Among these solutions, we show via physical arguments and\ntime-dependent numerical simulations that the minimum-torque solution, i.e.,\nthe solution with the smallest amount of toroidal field, is the one picked by a\nreal system. For $\\nu \\geq 1$, the Lorentz factor of the outflow increases\nalong a field line as $\\gamma \\approx M(z/\\Rfp)^{(2-\\nu)/2} \\approx R/R_{\\rm\nA}$, where $\\Rfp$ is the radius of the foot-point of the field line on the disk\nand $R_{\\rm A}=\\Rfp/M$ is the cylindrical radius at which the field line\ncrosses the Alfven surface or the light cylinder.

Here we\naddress the question whether the remaining $22\\pm10%$ can be accounted for by\nthermal evaporation of gas from clusters. We have found that evaporation can\noccur only from the cluster ``surface'', $r\\sim r_{\\rm vir}$, and not from it's\ninterior. We evaluated particle diffusion through the magnetized ICM for\nseveral scenarios of ISM turbulence and found that diffusivity is suppressed by\nat least a factor of 100 or more, compared to the Spitzer value.

This lowers the cluster-averaged fraction of the evaporated hot gas to\nfew percent or less.

An analysis by Tegmark et al. (1996) shows that the BATSE 3B catalog\nof 1122 bursts is consistent with no repeaters being present, and assuming that\nthis is indeed the case, our result implies a host population with at least\nH=1.2x10^6 members. Without the explicit assumption of no repeaters, a Bayesian\nanalysis based on the results of Tegmark et al.

In the light of the\nnon-detection of identifiable hosts in the small error-boxes associated with\ntransient counterparts to GRBs, this result gives a model independent lower\nbound to the number of any rare or exotic hosts. If in fact GRBs are found to\nbe associated with a particular sub-class of galaxies, then an analysis along\nthe lines presented here can be used to place a lower bound on the fraction of\ngalaxies in this sub-class. Another possibility is to treat galaxy clusters\n(rather than individual galaxies) as the host population, provided that the\nangular size of each cluster considered is less than the resolution of the\ndetector. Finally, if repeaters are ever detected in a statistically\nsignificant manner, this analysis can be readily adapted to find upper and\nlower limits on $H$. \n\n"}

An\nanalytical approach to the analysis of the angular momentum distributions\nassumes that the haloes are initially homogeneous ellipsoids and that the\ngrowth of the angular momentum of the haloes halts at their maximum expansion\ntime. However, the maximum expansion time cannot be determined uniquely,\nbecause in the hierarchical clustering scenario each progenitor, or subunit, of\nthe halo has its own maximum expansion time. Therefore the merging history of\nthe halo may be important in estimating its angular momentum. Using the merger\ntree model by Rodrigues & Thomas, which takes into account the spatial\ncorrelations of the density fluctuations, we have investigated the effects of\nthe merging histories on the angular momentum distributions of dark matter\nhaloes. It was found that the merger effects, that is, the effects of the\ninhomogeneity of the maximum expansion times of the progenitors which finally\nmerge together into a halo, do not strongly affect the final angular momentum\ndistributions, so that the homogeneous ellipsoid approximation happens to be\ngood for the estimation of the angular momentum distribution of dark matter\nhaloes.

Deviations from a dipolar magnetic\nfield structure are not evident and absolute timing across the wide frequency\nrange with a single dispersion measure is possible. We seem to observe mainly\nunfilled emission beams, which must originate from a very compact region. A\ncompact emission region is also suggested by a remarkably constant profile\nwidth or component separation over a very wide frequency range. For a few\nsources, polarization data at 2.7 and 4.9 GHz could also be obtained which\nindicate that millisecond pulsars are weakly polarized or even unpolarized at\nfrequencies above 3 GHz.

The MLM is based on the\nnetwork likelihood ratio (LR), which is a function of eight signal-parameters\nthat determine the Newtonian inspiral waveform. In the MLM-based strategy, the\nLR must be maximized over all of these parameters. Here, we show that it is\npossible to maximize it analytically over four of the eight parameters.\nMaximization over a fifth parameter, the time of arrival, is handled most\nefficiently by using the Fast-Fourier-Transform algorithm. This allows us to\nscan the parameter space continuously over these five parameters and also cuts\ndown substantially on the computational costs. Maximization of the LR over the\nremaining three parameters is handled numerically. This includes the\nconstruction of a bank of templates on this reduced parameter space.

Two\ntimescales for equilibration appears.For k^2><phi^2>(t) we observe an effective\nthermalization with a time scale in the thousands of inverse masses and the\nHartree approximation holds. By effective thermalization we mean that the\nobservable acquires the equilibrium functional form with an effective time\ndependent temperature Teff, which slowly decreases with time. Infrared modes\nwith k^2 < <phi^2>(t) equilibrate only by time scales in the millions of\ninverse masses. Infrared modes with k^2 < <phi^2>(t) equilibrate only by time\nscales in the millions.Virialization and the equation of state start to set\nmuch earlier than effective thermalization.The applicability of these results\nin quantum field theory for large occupation numbers and small coupling is\nanalyzed. \n\n"}

Abstract: We consider cosmic loop production by long string interactions in\ncosmological models with compact extra dimensions. In the case that the compact\nmanifold is not simply connected, we focus on the possibility of loops wrapping\naround non-trivial cycles and becoming topologically trapped. Such loops,\ndenoted cycloops, behave like matter in the radiation era, posing a potential\nmonopole problem. We calculate the number distribution and the energy density\nof these objects as functions of cosmic time and use them to study cosmological\nconstraints imposed on simple brane inflation models. For typical choices of\nparameters we find that to avoid cycloop domination before the matter-radiation\ntransition, the strings must be unacceptably light, namely $G\\mu<10^{-18}$,\nunless some mechanism to dilute the cycloops is provided. By exploring the full\nparameter space however, we are able to find models with $G\\mu \\sim 10^{-14}$,\nwhich is marginally consistent with brane inflation.

The inflaton is one of the transverse scalars of a\nD4-brane which has one of its spatial dimensions stretched between two\nNS5-branes, so that it is effectively three-dimensional. This D4-brane is\nattracted to a D6-brane that is separated from the 5-branes by a fixed amount.\nThe potential of the transverse scalar due to the D4/D6 interaction makes a\ngood inflaton potential. As the D4-brane slides along the two 5-branes towards\nthe 6-brane it begins to oscillate near the minimum of the potential.
