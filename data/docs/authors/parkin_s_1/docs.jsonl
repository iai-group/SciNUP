Using large overlap as a\nstability, or FQHE robustness, criterion we find the FQHE does not occur in the\nTLL (for any thickness), is the most robust for zero thickness in the LLL for\n1/3 and 1/5 and for 11/5 in the SLL, and is most robust at finite-thickness\n(4-5 magnetic lengths) in the SLL for the mysterious 5/2 state and the 7/3\nstate. No FQHE is found at 1/2 in the LLL for any thickness. We examine the\norbital effects of an in-plane (parallel) magnetic field finding its\napplication effectively reduces the thickness and could destroy the FQHE at 5/2\nand 7/3, while enhancing it at 11/5 as well as for LLL FQHE states. The\nin-plane field effects could thus be qualitatively different in the LLL and the\nSLL by virtue of magneto-orbital coupling through the finite thickness effect.\nIn the torus geometry, we show the appearance of the threefold topological\ndegeneracy expected for the Pfaffian state which is enhanced by thickness\ncorroborating our findings from overlap calculations.

In contrast to earlier studies, the\nsystem evolves under a so-called soft Glauber dynamic [P.A. Rikvold and M.\nKolesik, J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 35, L117 (2002)], for which both nucleation and\ninterface propagation are slower and the interfaces smoother than for the\nstandard Glauber dynamic. We choose the temperature and magnitude of the\nexternal field such that the metastable decay of the system following field\nreversal occurs through nucleation and growth of many droplets of the stable\nphase, i.e., the multidroplet regime. Using kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, we\nfind that the system undergoes a nonequilibrium phase transition, in which the\nsymmetry-broken dynamic phase corresponds to an asymmetric stationary limit\ncycle for the time-dependent magnetization. The critical point is located where\nthe half-period of the external field is approximately equal to the metastable\nlifetime of the system. We employ finite-size scaling analysis to investigate\nthe characteristics of this dynamical phase transition. The critical exponents\nand the fixed-point value of the fourth-order cumulant are found to be\nconsistent with the universality class of the two-dimensional equilibrium Ising\nmodel. As this universality class has previously been established for the same\nnonequilibrium model evolving under the standard Glauber dynamic, our results\nindicate that this far-from-equilibrium phase transition is universal with\nrespect to the choice of the stochastic dynamics. \n\n"}

In intrinsic monolayer and bilayer graphene, when\nsymmetry is not broken by external fields, the only spin-orbit coupling present\nat low energy near the corner of the Brillouin zone is the Kane-Mele term, that\nopens a bulk energy gap but does not break the spin degeneracy of the energy\nbands [C.

In\nparticular, we consider different types of interactions including screened\nCoulomb interactions, much like those produced by a point charge placed either\nabove a single infinite conducting plate or exactly halfway between two\nparallel infinite conducting plates. Our considerations are motivated by the\nfact that, in some recent experiments on bilayer graphene there is a single\ngate while in others there are two gates, which can function as the conducting\nplanes and which, we argue, can lead to distinct broken symmetry phases. We map\nout the phases that the system enters as a function of the range of the\ninteraction. We discover that the system enters an antiferromagnetic phase for\nshort ranges of the interaction and a nematic phase at long ranges, in\nagreement with previous work. While the antiferromagnetic phase results in a\ngap in the spectrum, the nematic phase is gapless, splitting the quadratic\ndegeneracy points into two Dirac cones each. We also consider the effects of an\napplied magnetic field on the system in the antiferromagnetic phase via\nvariational mean field theory. At low fields, we find that the\nantiferromagnetic order parameter, Delta(B)-Delta(0) \\sim B^2.

Here we investigate effects of\nvacancies on the stability of Z$_{2}$ topological order using the Kane-Mele\n(KM) model as a prototype of topological insulator.

Although both the electron\nspin and the structure of the local orbitals play a key role in this physics,\nin most systems these are connected only indirectly --- via the Pauli exclusion\nprinciple and the Coulomb interaction. Iridium-based oxides (iridates) open a\nfurther dimension to this problem by introducing strong spin-orbit\ninteractions, such that the Mott physics has a strong orbital character. In the\nlayered honeycomb iridates this is thought to generate highly spin-anisotropic\ninteractions, coupling the spin orientation to a given spatial direction of\nexchange and leading to strongly frustrated magnetism. The potential for new\nphysics emerging from such interactions has driven much scientific excitement,\nmost recently in the search for a new quantum spin liquid, first discussed by\nKitaev \\cite{kitaev_anyons_2006}.

The goal of the\nscheme under study is to extend the singlet $(S)$ - triplet $(T_0)$ qubit\ndecoherence time $T_2^{*}$ by dynamically transferring the polarization from\nthe electron spins to the nuclear spins. This polarization transfer is achieved\nby cycling the electron spins over the $S-T_+$ anticrossing.

In addition to $T_2^*$, we determine the singlet return\nprobability $P_s$, a quantity that can be measured in experiments.

Of\nmomentum, energy, and entropy transfer, the role of near-field effects on\nmomentum transfer between two half-spaces separated by a vacuum gap (van der\nWaals pressure in the vacuum gap) was first determined by Lifshitz, using\nRytov's theory of fluctuational electrodynamics in 1956.

In this\npaper we show how these effects can be used to reliably switch perpendicularly\nmagnetized layers and to move domain walls. A drift-diffusion treatment of the\nanomalous Hall effect and the anisotropic magnetoresistance describes the spin\ncurrents that flow in directions perpendicular to the electric field. In\nsystems with two ferromagnetic layers separated by a spacer layer, an in-plane\nelectric field cause spin currents to be injected from one layer into the\nother, creating spin transfer torques. Unlike the related spin Hall effect in\nnon-magnetic materials, the anomalous Hall effect and the anisotropic\nmagnetoresistance allow control of the orientation of the injected spins, and\nhence torques, by changing the direction of the magnetization in the injecting\nlayer. The torques on one layer show a rich angular dependence as a function of\nthe orientation of the magnetization in the other layer.

For the valley Hall effect of exciton, in both the mono- and bilayer\nMoS$_2$, with the exciton equally pumped in the K and K' valleys, the system\ncan evolve into the equilibrium state where the valley polarization is parallel\nto the effective magnetic field due to the exchange interaction. With the drift\nof this equilibrium state by applied uniaxial strain, the exchange interaction\ncan induce the {\\it momentum-dependent} valley/photoluminesence polarization,\nwhich leads to the valley/photoluminesence Hall current. Specifically, the\ndisorder strength dependence of the valley Hall conductivity is revealed. In\nthe strong scattering regime, the valley Hall conductivity decreases with the\nincrease of the disorder strength; whereas in the weak scattering regime, it\nsaturates to a constant, which can be much larger than the one in Fermi system\ndue to the absence of the Pauli blocking. \n\n"}

The\norigin of the diverse anisotropy is fully studied and the underlying mechanism\nis discussed in detail. With limited size, the $\\kappa$ could be effectively\nlowered, and the anisotropy could be effectively modulated by nanostructuring,\nwhich would extend the applications in nanoscale thermoelectrics and thermal\nmanagement. Our study offers fundamental understanding of the anisotropic\nphonon transport properties of 2D materials, and would be of significance for\nfurther study, modulation and aplications in emerging technologies. \n\n"}

In the presence of strong backscattering,\nfor example, (due to quenched disorder associated with random impurities),\nthese systems generically give rise to longitudinal magnetotransport.\nRestricting ourselves to the quantum limit (and assuming only the subspace of\nthe ZLLs to be partially filled) and mainly accounting for Gaussian impurities,\nwe show that the longitudinal magnetoconductivity (LMC) in all members of the\nWeyl family displays a positive linear-$B$ scaling, when the field is applied\nalong the axis that separates the Weyl nodes. But, in double and triple WSM,\nLMC displays a smooth crossover to a nonlinear $B$-dependence as the field is\ntilted away from such a high-symmetry direction. In addition, due to the\nenhanced density of states, the LL quantization can trigger instabilities\ntoward the formation of translational symmetry breaking density-wave orderings\nfor sufficiently weak interaction (BCS instability), which gaps out the ZLLs.\nConcomitantly as the temperature (magnetic field) is gradually decreased\n(increased) the LMC becomes negative. Thus WSMs with arbitrary monopole charge\n($n$) can host an intriguing interplay of LL quantization, longitudinal\nmagnetotransport (a possible manifestation of one-dimensional chiral or axial\nanomaly), and density-wave ordering, when placed in a strong magnetic field. \n\n"}

We show that this behaviour can be described in detail\nwithout the use of adjustable parameters in terms of the\nLarkin-Khmelnitskii-Shneerson-Rechester (LKSR) theory, first introduced nearly\n50 years ago, of the hybridization of polar and acoustic modes in quantum\nparaelectrics, in contrast to alternative models that have been proposed. Our\nstudy allows us to construct for the first time a detailed temperature-pressure\nphase diagram of a material on the border of a ferroelectric quantum critical\npoint comprising ferroelectric, quantum critical paraelectric and hybridized\npolar-acoustic regimes. Furthermore, at the lowest temperatures, below the\nsusceptibility maximum, we observe a new regime characterized by a linear\ntemperature dependence of the inverse susceptibility that differs sharply from\nthe quartic temperature dependence predicted by the LKSR theory. We find that\nthis non-LKSR low temperature regime cannot be accounted for in terms of any\ndetailed model reported in the literature, and its interpretation poses a new\nempirical and conceptual challenge. \n\n"}

Our study revealed the following features of the\nsinglet-quintet mixing. (1) The zero-temperature spin susceptibility remains\nzero for the singlet-quintet mixed state if only the centrosymmetric spin-orbit\ncoupling is taken into account, and will deviate from zero when the\nnon-centrosymmetric spin-orbit coupling is introduced. (2) The singlet-quintet\nmixing can help enhance the upper critical field roughly because it can\nincrease $T_c$.

In Weyl semimetals, the foundational gapless topological\nphase, chiral degeneracies are isolated near the Fermi level and give rise to\nthe Fermi-arc surface states. However, it is now recognized that chiral\ndegeneracies are ubiquitous in the band structures of systems with broken\nspatial inversion ($\\mathcal{P}$) or time-reversal ($\\mathcal{T}$) symmetry.\nThis leads to a broadly defined notion of topological metals, which implies the\npresence of disconnected Fermi surface sheets characterized by non-zero Chern\nnumbers inherited from the enclosed chiral degeneracies. Here, we address the\npossibility of experimentally observing surface-related signatures of chiral\ndegeneracies in metals. As a representative system we choose bcc iron, a\nwell-studied archetypal ferromagnetic metal with two nontrivial electron\npockets. We find that the (110) surface presents arc-like resonances attached\nto the topologically nontrivial electron pockets.

We present a consistent self-adjoint\nformulation of the problem of scattering on a finite-range potential, which is\nbased on separation of the configuration space on two, internal and external,\nsegments. The scattering amplitude is expressed in terms of the resolvent of a\nnon-Hermitian operator H.

We discuss this freedom and show explicitly that\nthe physical scattering amplitude is, nevertheless, unique though not all\nchoices are equally adequate from the physical point of view.

It was observed that in\ncontrast to the results of inelastic neutron scattering, the optic soft mode\nwas underdamped at all temperatures. On heating, the TO1 soft phonon followed\nthe Cochran law with an extrapolated critical temperature equal to the Burns\ntemperature of 670 K and softened down to 50 cm-1. Above 450 K the soft mode\nfrequency leveled off and slightly increased above the Burns temperature. A\ncentral mode, describing the dynamics of polar nanoclusters appeared below the\nBurns temperature at frequencies near the optic soft mode and dramatically\nslowed down below 1 MHz on cooling below room temperature.

Its cornerstone is a smooth free-energy functional, designed so that\nthe stable solutions connecting any two phases are completely free of the third\nphase. For the simplest choice of this functional, the equations of motion for\neach of the two solid-liquid interfaces can be mapped to the standard\nphase-field model of single-phase solidification, and all thin-interface\ncorrections to the dynamics of the solid-liquid interfaces can be eliminated.\nThis means that simulation results become independent of the thickness W of the\ndiffuse interfaces. As a consequence, accurate results can be obtained using\nvalues of W much larger than the physical interface thickness, which makes\nsimulations for realistic experimental parameters feasible. Convergence of the\nsimulation outcome with decreasing W is explicitly demonstrated. The results\nare also compared to a boundary-integral formulation of the corresponding\nfree-boundary problem. Excellent agreement is found, except in the immediate\nvicinity of bifurcation points, where differences arise.

Initially, Berk and Schrieffer showed how paramagnon spin\nfluctuations could suppress superconductivity in nearly-ferromagnetic\nmaterials. Following this, Rietschel and various co-workers wrote a number of\npapers in which they investigated the role of spin fluctuations in reducing the\nT_c of various electron-phonon superconductors. Paramagnon spin fluctuations\nare also believed to provide the p-wave pairing mechanism responsible for the\nsuperfluid phases of $^3He$. More recently, antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations\nhave been proposed as the mechanism for d-wave pairing in the heavy-fermion\nsuperconductors and in some organic materials as well as possibly the high T_c\ncuprates. Here I will review some of this early history and discuss some of the\nthings we have learned more recently from numerical simulations. \n\n"}

We calculate the bandgap\nrenormalization as a function of the density of conduction band electrons,\ninduced by the donor layer and/or the gate, for the translationally invariant\nwire, incorporating all growth and geometric properties of the structure\ncompletely. We show that most of the bandgap renormalization arises from\nexchange-correlation effects, but that a small shift also results from the\ndifference of wave function evolution between electrons and holes. We calculate\nthe binding energy of excitons in the wire, which breaks translational\ninvariance, using a simpler, cylindrical model of the wire. For a single hole\nand a one dimensional electron gas of density n_e, screening of the exciton\nbinding energy is shown to approximately compensate for bandgap\nrenormalization, suggesting that the recombination energy remains approximately\nconstant with n_e, in agreement with experiment. We find that the nature of\nscreening, as treated within our non-linear model, is significantly different\nfrom that of the various linear screening treatments, and the orthogonality of\nfree carrier states with the bound electron states has a profound effect on the\nscreening charge. We find that the electron and hole remain bound for all\ndensities up to about 3 x 10^6 cm^{-1} and that, as n_e increases from zero,\ntrion and even ``quadron'' formation becomes allowed. \n\n"}

The thickness of the layers is\nproportional to the input flow of particles $r_0$ and coincides with the\nthickness of stratified layers in a two-component sandpile problem which were\nobserved recently. We find that the surface angle $\\theta$ of the pile reaches\nits final critical value ($\\theta_f$) only at long times after a complicated\nrelaxation process. The deviation ($\\theta_f - \\theta $) behaves asymptotically\nas $(t/r_{0})^{-1/2}$. It appears that the pile evolution depends on initial\nconditions. We consider two cases: (i) grains are absent at the initial moment,\nand (ii) there is already a pile with a critical slope initially. Although at\nlong times the behavior appears to be similar in both cases, some differences\nare observed for the different initial conditions are observed.

However the\ntransmission and processing of (quantum) information is a physical process in\nspacetime. Therefore such basic notions in quantum information theory as qubit,\nchannel, composite systems and entangled states should be formulated in space\nand time. In particlular we suggest that instead of a two level system (qubit)\nthe basic notion in a relativistic quantum information theory should be a\nnotion of an elementary quantum system, i.e. an infinite dimensional Hilbert\nspace $H$ invariant under an irreducible representation of the Poincare group\nlabeled by $[m,s]$ where $m\\geq 0$ is mass and $s=0,1/2,1,...$ is spin.
