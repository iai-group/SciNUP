Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on\nthe role that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in\nglobular clusters, e.g., influencing the distribution of horizontal branch\nstars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of some globular clusters, and in\nforming low mass white dwarfs. \n\n"}

We also present estimates of the fraction of cores in the\n\"prestellar\", \"stellar'', and \"failed\" (those cores that redisperse back into\nthe environment) stages as a function of n_thr. The number ratios are measured\nindirectly in the simulations due to their resolution limitations. Our approach\ncontains one free parameter, the lifetime of a protostellar object t_yso (Class\n0 + Class I stages), which is outside the realm of the simulations. Assuming a\nvalue t_yso = 0.46 Myr, we obtain number ratios of starless to stellar cores\nranging from 4-5 at n_thr = 1.5 x 10^4 cm^-3 to 1 at n_thr = 1.2 x 10^5 cm^-3,\nagain in good agreement with observational determinations.

The galaxy is known to possess a dramatic 70 kpc\nX-ray tail. The detected H-alpha tail coincides positionally with the X-ray\ntail. The H-alpha emission in the galaxy is sharply truncated on the front and\nthe sides near the nucleus, indicating significant ram pressure stripping. ESO\n137-001 is thus the first cluster late-type galaxy known unambiguously with\nboth an X-ray tail and an H-alpha tail. The emission-line objects are all\ndistributed downstream of the galaxy, with projected distance up to 39 kpc from\nthe galaxy. From the analysis on the H-alpha_{off} frame and the estimate of\nthe background emission-line objects, we conclude that it is very likely all 29\nemission-line objects are HII regions in A3627.

The\nproperties of these subshells are compared to optical polarization data that\ntrace the nearby interstellar magnetic field (ISMF), and the distribution of\ninterstellar FeII and CaII within about 55 pc of the Sun. The result is that a\nmodel of Loop I as composed of two magnetic subshells is a viable description\nof the distribution of nearby low density ISM. Column densities of the\nrecombinant ion CaII are found to increase with the strength of the\ninterstellar radiation field, rather than with star distance or total\npathlength through the two magnetic subshells. As found earlier, the symmetry\nof the dipole moment of the cosmic microwave background corresponds to the\nsymmetries of the heliosphere and local ISMF (to within 10 degrees). \n\n"}

The primary new feature identified in the main disk body\nis a latitude-dependent radial epicyclic motion driven by pressure gradients\nattributable to the gravitomagnetic warping of the disk. The induced motion of\nthe gas is coherent over the scale of the entire disk and is fast enough that\nit could be observable in features such as relativistic iron lines. The\neccentricity of the associated fluid element trajectories increases with\ndecreasing radius, leading to a crowding of orbit trajectories near their\napocenters. This results in a local density enhancement akin to a compression.\nThese compressions are sufficiently strong to produce a pair of weak shocks in\nthe vicinity of the black hole. These shocks are roughly aligned with the\nline-of-nodes between the black-hole symmetry plane and disk midplane, with one\nshock above the line-of-nodes on one side of the black hole and the other below\non the opposite side.

The\ncomparison with an existing dynamical model extended by a recipe for\ndistinguishing between atomic and molecular gas shows that a significant part\nof the gas is stripped in the form of overdense arm-like structures.

We demonstrate how the area covered by the hotspot at the neutron\nstar surface is decreasing in the course of the outburst together with the\nreflection amplitude. These trends are in agreement with the natural scenario,\nwhere the disc inner edge is receding from the neutron star as the mass\naccretion rate drops. These findings are further supported by the variations of\nthe pulse profiles, which clearly show the presence of the secondary maximum at\nthe late stages of the outburst after October 29. This fact can be interpreted\nas the disc receding sufficiently far from the neutron star to open the view of\nthe lower magnetic pole. In that case, the disc inner radius can be estimated.\nAssuming that disc is truncated at the Alfv\\'en radius, we constrain the\nstellar magnetic moment to \\mu=(9\\pm5) 10^{25} G cm^3, which corresponds to the\nsurface field of 10^8 G.

In particular, the shape of the primordial\npower spectrum (PPS) is, at best, a well motivated assumption. It is known that\nthe assumed functional form of the PPS in cosmological parameter estimation can\naffect the best fit parameters and their relative confidence limits. In this\npaper, we demonstrate that a specific assumed form actually drives the best fit\nparameters into distinct basins of likelihood in the space of cosmological\nparameters where the likelihood resists improvement via modifications to the\nPPS. The regions where considerably better likelihoods are obtained allowing\nfree form PPS lie outside these basins. In the absence of a preferred model of\ninflation, this raises a concern that current cosmological parameters estimates\nare strongly prejudiced by the assumed form of PPS.

However, vortex dynamics is commonly studied in\nnon-self-gravitating discs. The main goal here is to examine the effects of\ndisc self-gravity on vortex dynamics. For this purpose, we employ the 2D\nself-gravitating shearing sheet approximation. A simple cooling law with a\nconstant cooling time is adopted, such that the disc settles down into a\nquasi-steady gravitoturbulent state. In this state, vortices appear as\ntransient structures undergoing recurring phases of formation, growth to sizes\ncomparable to a local Jeans scale and eventual shearing and destruction due to\nthe combined effects of self-gravity and background Keplerian shear. Each phase\ntypically lasts about 2 orbital periods or less. As a result, in\nself-gravitating discs the overall dynamical picture of vortex evolution is\nirregular consisting of many transient vortices at different evolutionary\nstages and, therefore, with various sizes up to the local Jeans scale. Vortices\ngenerate density waves during evolution, which turn into shocks. Therefore, the\ndynamics of density waves and vortices are coupled implying that, in general,\none should consider both vortex and spiral density wave modes in order to get a\nproper understanding of self-gravitating disc dynamics. Our results suggest\nthat given such an irregular and rapidly varying character of vortex evolution\nin self-gravitating discs, it may be difficult for such vortices to effectively\ntrap dust particles. Further study of the behaviour of dust particles embedded\nin a self-gravitating gaseous disc is, however, required to strengthen this\nconclusion. \n\n"}

In\nthe Galactic sample we find no significant enrichment amongst the core\nhydrogen-burning stars, which appears to be in contrast with the expectation\nfrom both rotating single-star and close binary evolution models. However, only\na small number of the rapidly rotating stars have evolved enough to produce a\nsignificant nitrogen enrichment, and these may be analogous to the non-enriched\nrapid rotators previously found in the LMC sample.

Several detectors are currently\nsearching for gravitational waves and a space based satellite, the Laser\nInterferometer Space Antenna (LISA), is in the final stages of pre-flight. The\nresults for large loop sizes ($\\alpha=0.1$) put an upper limit of about\n$G\\mu<10^{-9}$ and indicate that gravitational waves from string loops down to\n$G\\mu \\approx 10^{-20}$ could be detectabe by LISA. The string tension is\nrelated to the energy scale of the phase transition and the Planck mass via\n$G\\mu = \\Lambda_s^2 / m_{pl}^2$, so the limits on $G\\mu$ set the energy scale\nof any phase transition to $\\Lambda_s < 10^{-4.5} m_{pl}$.

We study a toy model where the flow behind a planar\nstationary accretion shock is adiabatically decelerated by an external\npotential. Two magnetic field geometries are considered: parallel or\nperpendicular to the shock. The entropy-vorticity wave, which is simply\nadvected in the unmagnetized limit, separates into five different waves: the\nentropy perturbations are advected, while the vorticity can propagate along the\nfield lines through two Alfven waves and two slow magnetosonic waves. The two\ncycles existing in the unmagnetized limit, advective-acoustic and purely\nacoustic, are replaced by up to six distinct MHD cycles.

We investigate\nthe evolution of this outburst with two-dimensional axisymmetric gasdynamical\ncalculations in which the cavities are inflated by relativistic cosmic rays.\nMany key observational features of the cavities and associated shocks are\nsuccessfully reproduced. The radial elongation of the cavities indicates that\ncosmic rays were injected into the cluster gas by a (jet) source moving out\nfrom the central AGN.

We model the evolution of the\nmagnetic field and solve for the particle distribution inside a uniformly\nexpanding PWN. The model is calibrated by fitting the calculated spectrum to\nthe observations of the Crab Nebula at an age of a thousand years. We find that\nonly a small fraction of the injected energy from the Crab Pulsar goes to the\nmagnetic field, consistent with previous studies. The spectral evolution model\nof the Crab Nebula shows that the flux ratio of TeV gamma-rays to X-rays\nincreases with time, which implies that old PWNe are faint at X-rays, but not\nat TeV gamma-rays. The increase of this ratio is primarily because the magnetic\nfield decreases with time and is not because the X-ray emitting particles are\ncooled more rapidly than the TeV gamma-ray emitting particles.

The intrinsic brightness of Vela at GeV energies\ncombined with the angular resolution and sensitivity of the LAT allow us to\nmake the most detailed study to date of the energy-dependent light curves and\nphase-resolved spectra, using a LAT-derived timing model. The light curve\nconsists of two peaks (P1 and P2) connected by bridge emission containing a\nthird peak (P3). We have confirmed the strong decrease of the P1/P2 ratio with\nincreasing energy seen with EGRET and previous Fermi LAT data, and observe that\nP1 disappears above 20 GeV. The increase with energy of the mean phase of the\nP3 component can be followed with much greater detail, showing that P3 and P2\nare present up to the highest energies of pulsation. We find significant pulsed\nemission at phases outside the main profile, indicating that magnetospheric\nemission exists over 80% of the pulsar period.

The ideal MHD limit Abstract: We explore the amplification of magnetic seed fields during the formation of\nthe first stars and galaxies. During gravitational collapse, turbulence is\ncreated from accretion shocks, which may act to amplify weak magnetic fields in\nthe protostellar cloud. Numerical simulations showed that such turbulence is\nsub-sonic in the first star-forming minihalos, and highly supersonic in the\nfirst galaxies with virial temperatures larger than 10^4 K. We investigate the\nmagnetic field amplification during the collapse both for Kolmogorov and\nBurgers-type turbulence with a semi-analytic model that incorporates the\neffects of gravitational compression and small-scale dynamo amplification. We\nfind that the magnetic field may be substantially amplified before the\nformation of a disk. On scales of 1/10 of the Jeans length, saturation occurs\nafter ~10^8 yr. Although the saturation behaviour of the small-scale dynamo is\nstill somewhat uncertain, we expect a saturation field strength of the order\n~10^{-7} n^{0.5} G in the first star-forming halos, with n the number density\nin cgs units. In the first galaxies with higher turbulent velocities, the\nmagnetic field strength may be increased by an order of magnitude, and\nsaturation may occur after 10^6 to 10^7 yr. In the Kolmogorov case, the\nmagnetic field strength on the integral scale (i.e. the scale with most\nmagnetic power) is higher due to the characteristic power-law indices, but the\ndifference is less than a factor of 2 in the saturated phase. Our results thus\nindicate that the precise scaling of the turbulent velocity with length scale\nis of minor importance. They further imply that magnetic fields will be\nsignificantly enhanced before the formation of a protostellar disk, where they\nmay change the fragmentation properties of the gas and the accretion rate. \n\n"}

By Binary model we refer both to\nstellar and substellar companions that enhance the mass loss rate, where\nsubstellar companions stand for both massive planets and brown dwarfs.

We reach\nthis conclusion by noticing that the bimodal distribution of planets around\nstars with respect to the parameter M_p*a^2, is most prominent for stars in the\nmass range 1Mo < M < 1.5Mo; 'a' is the orbital separation, 'M' is the stellar\nmass and 'M_p' the planet mass.

For high-latitude stars the ratios Mg/Si\nand Fe/Si in dust are close to 1.5. For disk stars they are reduced to ${\\rm\nMg/Si} \\sim 1.2$ and ${\\rm Fe/Si} \\sim 1.05$.

It is thus one of the best\ncases for studying the properties of massive protostars to constrain high-mass\nstar formation theories. Near-infrared radiation from source I escapes through\nthe cavity opened by the OMC1 outflow and is scattered by dust towards our line\nof sight. The reflected spectrum offers a unique possibility of observing the\nemission from the innermost regions of the system and probing the nature of\nsource I and its immediate surroundings. We obtained moderately high\nspectral-resolution (R~9000) observations of the near-infrared diffuse emission\nin several locations around source I/Orion-KL. We observed a widespread rich\nabsorption line spectrum that we compare with cool stellar photospheres and\nprotostellar accretion disk models. The spectrum is broadly similar to strongly\nveiled, cool, low-gravity stellar photospheres in the range Teff~3500-4500 K,\nluminosity class I-III. An exact match explaining all features has not been\nfound, and a plausible explanation is that a range of different temperatures\ncontribute to the observed absorption spectrum. The 1D velocity dispersions\nimplied by the absorption spectra, sigma~30 km/s, can be explained by the\nemission from a disk around a massive, mstar~10 Msun, protostar that is\naccreting at a high rate, mdot~3x10^{-3} Msun/yr. Our observations suggest that\nthe near-infrared reflection spectrum observed in the Orion-KL region is\nproduced close to source I and scattered to our line of sight in the OMC1\noutflow cavity. The spectrum allows us to exclude source I being a very large,\nmassive protostar rotating at breakup speed.

We remark that the scaling\nrelations often invoked for the relative importance of gravitational and\nmagnetic braking do not apply, and instead use simple non-empirical expressions\nfor the braking rates. In order to remove significant angular momentum, the\nwind must be tied to field lines anchored in one of the binary's component\nstars; uncertainties remain as to the driving mechanism for such a wind. In the\ncase of white dwarf accretors, we find that magnetic braking can potentially\nremove angular momentum on comparable or even shorter timescales than\ngravitational waves over a large range in orbital period.

We computed such a set of model atmospheres and emergent\nspectra in a plane-parallel, hydrostatic, and LTE approximation with Compton\nscattering taken into account. The models were calculated for six different\nchemical compositions: pure hydrogen and pure helium atmospheres, and\natmospheres with solar mix of hydrogen and helium, and various heavy element\nabundances Z = 1, 0.3, 0.1, and 0.01 Z_sun. For each chemical composition the\nmodels are computed for three values of surface gravity, log g =14.0, 14.3, and\n14.6, and for 20 values of the luminosity in units of the Eddington luminosity,\nL/L_Edd, in the range 0.001--0.98. The emergent spectra of all models are\nredshifted and fitted by a diluted blackbody in the RXTE/PCA 3--20 keV energy\nband, and corresponding values of the color correction (hardness factors) f_c\nare presented.

It is\ngenerally believed that for extreme mass ratios eta<<1, the scaling of the\nrecoil velocity is V {\\propto} eta^2, where the proportionality coefficient\ndepends on the spin of the larger hole and the geometry of the system (e.g.\norbital inclination).

This evolution in halo shape\ncorrelates well with the distribution of the infalling material: prolate\nconfigurations arise when haloes are fed through narrow filaments, which\ncharacterizes the early epochs of halo assembly, whereas triaxial/oblate\nconfigurations result as the accretion turns more isotropic at later times.\nInterestingly, at redshift z=0, clear imprints of the past history of each halo\nare recorded in their shapes at different radii, which also exhibit a variation\nfrom prolate in the inner regions to triaxial/oblate in the outskirts.

At large separations, the tidal effect of the\nsecondary CO clears a gap. We show that the gap refills during the late\nGW-driven phase of the inspiral, leading to a sudden EM brightening of the\nsource. The accretion disk leaves an imprint on the GW through its angular\nmomentum exchange with the binary, the mass increase of the binary members due\nto accretion, and its gravity. We compute the disk-modified GWs both in an\nanalytical Newtonian approximation and in a numerical effective-one-body\napproach.

At the shock, the flow\ncompresses and the alternating fields annihilate by driven magnetic\nreconnection. Irrespective of the stripe wavelength \"lambda\" or the wind\nmagnetization \"sigma\" (in the regime sigma>>1 of magnetically-dominated flows),\nshock-driven reconnection transfers all the magnetic energy of alternating\nfields to the particles, whose average Lorentz factor increases by a factor of\nsigma with respect to the pre-shock value. The shape of the post-shock spectrum\ndepends primarily on the ratio lambda/(r_L*sigma), where r_L is the\nrelativistic Larmor radius in the wind. The spectrum becomes broader as the\nvalue of lambda/(r_L*sigma) increases, passing from a relativistic Maxwellian\nto a flat power-law tail with slope around -1.5, populated by particles\naccelerated by the reconnection electric field.

This fits into a scenario in which the corona is cooled by the soft\nX-rays along the outburst evolution, as observed in several other atoll\nsources. By using the flux measured in the 1.5--30 keV band of the type-I\nbursts during the outburst, we find that the linear relationship between the\nburst duration and the flux still holds for those bursts that occur at the\ndecaying part of the low hard state, but with a different slope than the\noverall one that was estimated with the bursts happening in the whole extent\nof, and for the rest of the low hard state.

Accepting as a hypothesis that LS I +61 303 is the first magnetar\ndetected in a binary system, we study which are the implications. We find that\na magnetar-composed LS I +61 303-system would most likely be (i.e., for usual\nmagnetar parameters and mass-loss rate) subject to a flip-flop behavior, from a\nrotational powered regime (in apastron) to a propeller regime (in periastron)\nalong each of the LS I +61 303, eccentric orbital motion. We prove that whereas\nnear apastron an inter-wind shock can lead to the normally observed LS I +61\n303behavior, with TeV emission, the periastron propeller is expected to\nefficiently accelerate particles only to sub-TeV energies. This flip-flop\nscenario would explain the system's behavior where a recurrent TeV emission was\nseen appearing near apastron only, the anti-correlation of GeV and TeV\nemission, and the long-term TeV variability (which seems correlated to LS I +61\n303's super-orbital period), including the appearance of a low TeV-state.\nFinally, we qualitatively put the multi-wavelength phenomenology in context of\nour proposed model, and make some predictions for further testing. \n\n"}

This only occurs in a small\nfraction of massive stellar deaths, however, and requires unusual conditions. A\nmuch more frequent occurrence could be the death of a star that makes a black\nhole and a weak or absent outgoing shock, but in a progenitor that only has\nenough angular momentum in its outermost layers to make a disk. We consider\nseveral cases where this is likely to occur - blue supergiants with low mass\nloss rates, tidally-interacting binaries involving either helium stars or giant\nstars, and the collapse to a black hole of very massive pair-instability\nsupernovae.

Therefore, deep studies of these objects are instrumental for an\nunderstanding of the high energy processes in our Galaxy. RX J0852.0-4622, also\nknown as Vela Junior, is one of the few (4) shell-type SNRs resolved at Very\nHigh Energies (VHE; E > 100 GeV). It is one of the largest known VHE sources (~\n1.0 deg radius) and its flux level is comparable to the flux level of the Crab\nNebula in the same energy band. These characteristics allow for a detailed\nanalysis, shedding further light on the high-energy processes taking place in\nthe remnant. In this document we present further details on the spatial and\nspectral morphology derived with an extended data set. The analysis of the\nspectral morphology of the remnant is compatible with a constant power-law\nphoton index of 2.11 +/- 0.05_stat +/- 0.20_syst from the whole SNR in the\nenergy range from 0.5 TeV to 7 TeV. The analysis of the spatial morphology\nshows an enhanced emission towards the direction of the pulsar PSR J0855-4644,\nhowever as the pulsar is lying on the rim of the SNR, it is difficult to\ndisentangle both contributions.

We aim to obtain the Galactic trajectory of LS 5039 and PSR J1825-1446 to\nfind their origin in the Galaxy, and in particular to check their association\nwith SNR G016.8-01.1 to restrict their age. Methods. By means of radio and\noptical observations we obtained the proper motion and the space velocity of\nthe sources. Results. The proper motion of PSR J1825-1446 corresponds to a\ntransverse space velocity of 690 km/s at a distance of 5 kpc. Its Galactic\nvelocity at different distances is not compatible with the expected Galactic\nrotation. The velocity and characteristic age of PSR J1825-1446 make it\nincompatible with SNR G016.8-01.1.

Our results show that: (i) post-Newtonian effects cause\na small reduction in the GW background signal; (ii) below 100 Hz the background\ndepends primarily on the local coalescence rate $r_0$ and the average chirp\nmass and is independent of the chirp mass distribution; (iii) the effects of\ncosmic star formation rates and delay times between the formation and merger of\nbinaries are linear below 100 Hz and can be represented by a single parameter\nwithin a factor of ~ 2; (iv) a simple power law model of the energy density\nparameter $\\Omega_{GW}(f) ~ f^{2/3}$ up to 50-100 Hz is sufficient to be used\nas a search template for ground-based interferometers. In terms of the\ndetection prospects of the background signal, we show that: (i) detection (a\nsignal-to-noise ratio of 3) within one year of observation by the Advanced LIGO\ndetectors (H1-L1) requires a coalescence rate of $r_0 = 3 (0.2) Mpc^{-3}\nMyr^{-1}$ for binary neutron stars (binary black holes); (ii) this limit on\n$r_0$ could be reduced 3-fold for two co-located detectors, whereas the\ncurrently proposed worldwide network of advanced instruments gives only ~ 30%\nimprovement in detectability; (iii) the improved sensitivity of the planned\nEinstein Telescope allows not only confident detection of the background but\nalso the high frequency components of the spectrum to be measured.

The emergent luminosity is powered by CSM interaction, analogous to the\nprocess in luminous Type IIn supernovae, except with 10 times lower explosion\nenergy and at slower speeds (causing a longer duration and lower emergent\nluminosity). Such an explosive event provides a natural explanation for the\nlight curve evolution, but also accounts for a number of puzzling attributes of\nthe Homunculus nebula: (1) rough equipartition of total radiated and kinetic\nenergy, (2) the double-shell structure of the Homunculus, (3) the apparent\nsingle age and Hubble-like flow resulting from the thin swept-up shell, (4) the\ncomplex mottled appearance of the polar lobes in HST images, arising from\nRaleigh-Taylor or Vishniac instabilities, (5) efficient and rapid dust\nformation, as seen in Type IIn supernovae, and (6) the fast (5000 km/s)\nmaterial outside the Homunculus, arising from the acceleration of the forward\nshock upon exiting the dense CSM.

PSR\nJ0529-6652 is detectable as a single pulse emitter, with amplitudes that\nclassify the pulses as giant pulses. This makes PSR J0529-6652 the second known\ngiant pulse emitter in the LMC, after PSR B0540-69. The fraction of the emitted\npulses detectable from PSR J0529-6652 at this frequency is roughly two orders\nof magnitude greater than it is for either PSR B0540-69 or the Crab pulsar (if\nthe latter were located in the LMC). We have measured a pulse nulling fraction\nof 83.3 \\pm 1.5% and an intrinsic modulation index of 4.07 \\pm 0.29 for PSR\nJ0529-6652. The modulation index is significantly larger than values previously\nmeasured for typical radio pulsars but is comparable to values reported for\nmembers of several other neutron star classes. The large modulation index,\ngiant pulses, and large nulling fraction suggest that this pulsar is\nphenomenologically more similar to these other, more variable sources, despite\nhaving spin and physical characteristics that are typical of the unrecycled\nradio pulsar population. The large modulation index also does not appear to be\nconsistent with the small value predicted for this pulsar by a model of polar\ncap emission outlined by Gil & Sendyk (2000). This conclusion depends to some\nextent on the assumption that PSR J0529-6652 is exhibiting core emission, as\nsuggested by its simple profile morphology, narrow profile width, and\npreviously measured profile polarization characteristics. \n\n"}

The X-ray emission from the pulsar is consistent with a\nmagnetospheric non-thermal origin plus a thermal emission from a hot spot (or\nhot spots). The lack of a thermal component from the whole surface makes Morla\nthe coldest neutron star in its age range. We found marginal evidence for a\ndouble-peaked modulation of the X-ray emission. The study of the 9'-long tail\nconfirmed the lack of extended emission near the pulsar itself. The tail shows\na very asymmetric brightness profile and its spectrum lacks any spatial\nvariation. We found the nebular emission to be inconsistent with a classical\nbow-shock, ram-pressure dominated pulsar wind nebula. We propose thermal\nbremsstrahlung as an alternative mechanism for Morla's tail emission. In this\nscenario, the tail emission comes from the shocked interstellar medium (ISM)\nmaterial heated up to X-ray temperatures. This can fully explain the peculiar\nfeatures of the tail, assuming a hot, moderately dense interstellar medium\naround the pulsar.

We show here that, while the hot CGM of galaxies formed in\nthe simulations is metal poor in a mass-weighted sense, its X-ray\nluminosity-weighted metallicity is often close to solar. This bias arises\nbecause the soft X-ray emissivity of a typical 0.1 keV corona is dominated by\ncollisionally-excited metal ions that are synthesised in stars and recycled\ninto the hot CGM. We find that these metals are ejected primarily by stars that\nform in-situ to the main progenitor of the galaxy, rather than in satellites or\nexternal galaxies. The enrichment of the hot CGM therefore proceeds in an\ninside-out fashion throughout the assembly of the galaxy: metals are\ntransported from the central galaxy by SNe-driven winds and convection over\nseveral gigayears, establishing a strong negative radial metallicity gradient.\nWhilst metal ions synthesised by stars are necessary to produce the X-ray\nemissivity that enables the hot CGM of isolated galaxies to be detected, the\nelectrons that collisionally excite them are equally important. Since our\nsimulations indicate that the electron density of hot coronae is dominated by\nthe metal-poor gas accreted from the IGM, we infer that the hot CGM observed\nvia X-ray emission is the outcome of both hierarchical accretion and stellar\nrecycling. \n\n"}

Recent studies have reported relatively weak\ncorrelations between observed AGN luminosities and the properties of AGN hosts,\nwhich has been interpreted to imply that there is no direct connection between\nAGN activity and star formation. However, AGNs may be expected to vary\nsignificantly on a wide range of timescales (from hours to Myr) that are far\nshorter than the typical timescale for star formation (>~100 Myr).

We\npresent a simple model in which all star-forming galaxies host an AGN when\naveraged over ~100 Myr timescales, with long-term average AGN accretion rates\nthat are perfectly correlated with the star formation rate (SFR).

Abstract: Planetary migration is one of the most serious problems to systematically\nunderstand the observations of exoplanets. We clarify that the theoretically\npredicted type II migration is too fast, as well as type I migration, by\ndeveloping detailed analytical arguments in which the timescale of type II\nmigration is compared with the disk lifetime. In the disk-dominated regime, the\ntype II migration timescale is characterized by a {\\it local} viscous diffusion\ntimescale, while the disk lifetime characterized by a {\\it global} diffusion\ntimescale that is much longer than the local one. Even in the planet-dominated\nregime where the inertia of the planet mass reduces the migration speed, the\ntimescale is still shorter than the disk lifetime except in the final disk\nevolution stage where the total disk mass decays below the planet mass. This\nsuggests that most giant planets plunge into the central stars within the disk\nlifetime, and it contradicts the exoplanet observations that gas giants are\npiled up at $r \\ga 1$AU.

We have observed 29\nXMPs, which had not been observed before at 21 cm, using the Effelsberg radio\ntelescope. This information was complemented with HI data published in\nliterature for a further 53 XMPs. In addition, optical data from the literature\nprovided morphologies, stellar masses, star-formation rates and metallicities.\nEffelsberg HI integrated flux densities are between 1 and 15 Jy km/s, while\nline widths are between 20 and 120 km/s.

Models currently predict as\nmuch as 150 times the solar abundance of 33S in oxygen-neon nova ejecta.

Better knowledge of the\n33S(p,\\gamma)34Cl rate would also aid in interpreting nova observations over\nthe S-Ca mass region and contribute to the firm establishment of the maximum\nendpoint of nova nucleosynthesis. Additionally, the total S elemental abundance\nwhich is affected by this reaction has been proposed as a thermometer to study\nthe peak temperatures of novae. Previously, the 33S(p,\\gamma)34Cl reaction rate\nhad only been studied directly down to resonance energies of 432 keV.

We\nargue for this scenario using large field inflation assumed during a typical\nslow-roll regime, and typical values for the physical quantities associated\nwith the tunneling effect are worked out. It is shown how, as a result of these\nhighly energetic and localized processes, the components of the metric receive\nstrong gradients within a small volume. These pockets of gravity can gravitate\nboth attractively or repulsively, since the Ricci tensor contains squared\npartial derivative terms with either positive or negative sign, so they can be\na component of either dark matter or dark energy. As the Universe expands the\ncurvature of the pockets weakens as 1/a^2, where a(t) is the scale factor of\nthe expansion, but it is shown that, as long as the integral over the\ngravitating gravitational fields of the pocket is done over all of the\nexpanding volume of the pocket, the value of the integral is not affected by\nthe expansion.

{"id": "1312.2761", "contents": "Title: Modelling spectral and timing properties of accreting black holes: the\n  hybrid hot flow paradigm Abstract: The general picture that emerged by the end of 1990s from a large set of\noptical and X-ray, spectral and timing data was that the X-rays are produced in\nthe innermost hot part of the accretion flow, while the optical/infrared (OIR)\nemission is mainly produced by the irradiated outer thin accretion disc. Recent\nmultiwavelength observations of Galactic black hole transients show that the\nsituation is not so simple. Fast variability in the OIR band, OIR excesses\nabove the thermal emission and a complicated interplay between the X-ray and\nthe OIR light curves imply that the OIR emitting region is much more compact.\nOne of the popular hypotheses is that the jet contributes to the OIR emission\nand even is responsible for the bulk of the X-rays. However, this scenario is\nlargely ad hoc and is in contradiction with many previously established facts.\nAlternatively, the hot accretion flow, known to be consistent with the X-ray\nspectral and timing data, is also a viable candidate to produce the OIR\nradiation. The hot-flow scenario naturally explains the power-law like OIR\nspectra, fast OIR variability and its complex relation to the X-rays if the hot\nflow contains non-thermal electrons (even in energetically negligible\nquantities), which are required by the presence of the MeV tail in Cyg X-1. The\npresence of non-thermal electrons also lowers the equilibrium electron\ntemperature in the hot flow model to <100 keV, making it more consistent with\nobservations.

We investigate this by performing a detailed time-resolved spectral\nanalysis of the superburst from 4U 1636-536 observed in 2001 with the Rossi\nX-ray Timing Explorer. Superbursts are attributed to the thermonuclear burning\nof carbon, and are approximately 1000 times more energetic than the regular\nshort Type I bursts. This allows us to study detailed spectra for over 11 ks,\ncompared to at most 100 s for regular bursts. A feature is present in the\nsuperburst spectra around 6.4 keV that is well fit with an emission line and an\nabsorption edge, suggestive of reflection of the superburst off the accretion\ndisk. The line and edge parameters evolve over time: the edge energy decreases\nfrom 9.4 keV at the peak to 8.1 keV in the tail, and both features become\nweaker in the tail. This is only the second superburst for which this has been\ndetected, and shows that this behavior is present even without strong radius\nexpansion. Furthermore, we find the persistent flux to almost double during the\nsuperburst, and return to the pre-superburst level in the tail. The combination\nof reflection features and increased persistent emission indicates that the\nsuperburst had a strong impact on the inner accretion disk, and it emphasizes\nthat X-ray bursts provide a unique probe of accretion physics. \n\n"}

Secular dynamics controls its long term evolution with orbital\ncommensurability having negligible effect. Secular interactions transfer\nangular momentum between inner and outer orbits unless their apsidal lines are\nparallel or anti-parallel. These choices correspond, respectively, to\northogonal eigenmodes p and a. Each is characterized by an eccentricity ratio\nset by the masses and semi-major axes, i.e., $e_{p, 1}/e_{p, 2}\\sim a_1/a_2$\nwhile $e_{a, 1}/e_{a, 2}\\sim (a_1/a_2)^{-3/2}(m_2/m_1)$. Mode p dominates the\nsystem's current state so $e_1/e_2$ always remains close to $e_{p, 1}/e_{p,\n2}$. A small contribution by Mode a causes $e_1$ and $e_2$ to oscillate with\nperiod $\\sim 10^3\\,\\yr$. Orbital changes should be apparent in a few years.\nThese will reveal the forcing of the apsidal precession of the inner orbit by\ngeneral relativity (GR), and possibly also the smaller contribution due to the\ntidal and rotational distortion of the inner white dwarf (WD). Phinney (1992)\nproposes that the epicyclic energy of a WD-pulsar binary reaches equipartition\nwith the kinetic energy of a single convective eddy when the WD's progenitor\nfills its Roche lobe.

The most effective eddies are those with\nlifetimes closest to the orbit period. These were more energetic in the\nprogenitor of the outer WD.

The supermassive black hole, Sagittarius (Sgr) A*, in the centre of\nour Galaxy has the largest angular size in the sky among all astrophysical\nblack holes. Its shadow, assuming no rotation, spans ~ 50 microarcsec.\nResolving such dimensions has long been out of reach for astronomical\ninstruments until a new generation of interferometers being operational during\nthis decade. Of particular interest is the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) with\nresolution ~ 20 microarcsec in the millimeter-wavelength range 0.87 mm - 1.3\nmm. Aims. We investigate the ability of the fully general relativistic\nKomissarov (2006) analytical magnetized torus model to account for observable\nconstraints at Sgr A* in the centimeter and millimeter domains. The impact of\nthe magnetic field geometry on the observables is also studied. Methods. We\ncalculate ray-traced centimeter- and millimeter-wavelength synchrotron spectra\nand images of a magnetized accretion torus surrounding the central black hole\nin Sgr A*. We assume stationarity, axial symmetry, constant specific angular\nmomentum and polytropic equation of state. A hybrid population of thermal and\nnon-thermal electrons is considered. Results. We show that the torus model is\ncapable of reproducing spectral constraints in the millimeter domain, and in\nparticular in the observable domain of the EHT. However, the torus model is not\nyet able to fit the centimeter spectrum. 1.3 mm images at high inclinations are\nin agreement with observable constraints. Conclusions. The ability of the torus\nmodel to account for observations of Sgr A* in the millimeter domain is\ninteresting in the perspective of the future EHT. Such an analytical model\nallows very fast computations. It will thus be a suitable test bed for\ninvestigating large domains of physical parameters, as well as non-black-hole\ncompact object candidates and alternative theories of gravity. \n\n"}

To investigate this\ncorrelation, we use a phenomenological model that successfully describes star\nformation rates, luminosities and stellar masses of star forming galaxies,\napplying it to GRB production. We predict luminosities, stellar masses, and\nmetallicities of host galaxies depending on the metallicity bias. Our\nbest-fitting model includes a moderate metallicity bias, broadly consistent\nwith the large majority of long-duration GRBs in metal-poor environments\noriginating from collapsars (probability ~83%), but with a secondary\ncontribution (~17%) from metal-independent production channels, such as binary\nevolution. Because of the mass-metallicity relation of galaxies, the maximum\nlikelihood model predicts that the metal-independent channel becomes dominant\nat z<2, where hosts have higher metallicities and collapsars are suppressed.\nThis possibly explains why some studies find no clear evidence of a metal-bias\nbased on low-z samples. However, while metallicity predictions match\nobservations well at high redshift, there is tension with low redshift\nobservations, since a significant fraction of GRB hosts are predicted to have\n(near-)solar metallicity. This is in contrast to observations, unless obscured,\nmetal-rich hosts are preferentially missed in current datasets, and suggests\nthat lower efficiencies of the metal-independent GRB channel might be preferred\nfollowing a comprehensive fit from complete samples.

This is\nadvantageous in that all sources in the sample are used in the clustering\nanalysis, not just the subset with secure spectroscopy. The method works best\nfor large samples. The loss of accuracy because of the lack of spectroscopy is\nbalanced by increasing the number of sources used to measure the clustering.

Moreover, the wind is able to\nachieve and maintain a configuration with reflection symmetry at disk midplane.\nThe case with anti-aligned field polarity (Omega.

The Hall\neffect affects the stability of the midplane region to the MRI, leading to\nstrong/weak Maxwell stress for aligned/anti-aligned field polarities.\nNevertheless, the midplane region is only very weakly turbulent. Overall, the\nbasic picture is analogous to the conventional layered accretion scenario\napplied to the outer disk. In addition, we find that the vertical magnetic flux\nis strongly concentrated into thin, azimuthally extended shells in most of our\nsimulations beyond 15AU. This is a generic phenomenon unrelated to the Hall\neffect, and leads to enhanced zonal flow. Observational and theoretical\nimplications, as well as future prospects are briefly discussed. \n\n"}

I: Stellar mass at z<1 Abstract: LGRBs are associated with massive stars and are therefore linked to star\nformation. The conditions necessary to produce LGRBs can affect the relation\nbetween the LGRB rate and star formation. By using the power of a complete LGRB\nsample, our aim is to understand whether such a bias exists and, if it does,\nwhat is its origin. In this first paper, we build the SED of the z<1 host\ngalaxies of the BAT6 LGRB sample, and determine their stellar masses from SED\nfitting. We compare the resulting stellar mass distribution (i) with\nstar-forming galaxies observed in deep surveys (UltraVISTA); (ii) with\nsemi-analitical models of the z<1 star forming galaxy population and (iii) with\nnumerical simulations of LGRB hosts having different metallicity thresholds for\nthe progenitor star environment. We find that at z<1 LGRBs tend to avoid\nmassive galaxies and are powerful in selecting faint low-mass star-forming\ngalaxies. The stellar mass distribution of the hosts is not consistent with\nthat of the UltraVISTA star-forming galaxies weighted for their SFR. This\nimplies that, at least at z<1, LGRBs are not unbiased tracers of star\nformation. To make the two distributions consistent, a much steeper faint-end\nof the mass function would be required, or a very shallow SFR-Mass relation for\nthe low mass galaxy population. GRB host galaxy simulations indicates that, to\nreproduce the stellar mass distribution, a metallicity threshold of the order\nof Z_th=0.3-0.5Z_sun is necessary. Models without a metallicity threshold or\nwith an extreme threshold of Z_th = 0.1Z_sun are excluded at z<1. The use of\nthe BAT6 complete sample makes this result not affected by possible biases\nwhich could have influenced past results based on incomplete samples. The\npreference for low metallicities (Z<~0.5Z_sun) can be a consequence of the\nparticular conditions needed for the progenitor star to produce a GRB.\n(Abridged) \n\n"}

We model neutron stars with realistic equations of\nstate (notably through piecewise polytropic equations of state). Using these\nquasiequilibrium sequences we compute the binary's scalar charge and binding\nenergy versus orbital angular frequency. We find that the absolute value of the\nbinding energy is smaller than in general relativity (GR), differing at most by\n~14% at high frequencies for the cases considered. We use the newly computed\nbinding energy and the balance equation to estimate the number of\ngravitational-wave (GW) cycles during the adiabatic, quasicircular inspiral\nstage up to the end of the sequence, which is the last stable orbit or the\nmass-shedding point, depending on which comes first. We find that, depending on\nthe ST parameters, the number of GW cycles can be substantially smaller than in\nGR. In particular, we obtain that when dynamical scalarization sets in around a\nGW frequency of ~130 Hz, the sole inclusion of the ST binding energy causes a\nreduction of GW cycles from ~120 Hz up to the end of the sequence (~1200 Hz) of\n~11% with respect to the GR case.

Determination of the fundamental interactions that\ngovern matter under such extreme conditions is one of the major unsolved\nproblems of modern physics, and -- since it is impossible to replicate these\nconditions on Earth -- a major scientific motivation for SKA. The most\nstringent observational constraints come from measurements of NS bulk\nproperties: each model for the microscopic behaviour of matter predicts a\nspecific density-pressure relation (its `Equation of state', EOS). This\ngenerates a unique mass-radius relation which predicts a characteristic radius\nfor a large range of masses and a maximum mass above which NS collapse to black\nholes. It also uniquely predicts other bulk quantities, like maximum spin\nfrequency and moment of inertia. The SKA, in Phase 1 and particularly in Phase\n2 will, thanks to the exquisite timing precision enabled by its raw\nsensitivity, and surveys that dramatically increase the number of sources: 1)\nProvide many more precise NS mass measurements (high mass NS measurements are\nparticularly important for ruling out EOS models); 2) Allow the measurement of\nthe NS moment of inertia in highly relativistic binaries such as the Double\nPulsar; 3) Greatly increase the number of fast-spinning NS, with the potential\ndiscovery of spin frequencies above those allowed by some EOS models; 4)\nImprove our knowledge of new classes of binary pulsars such as black widows and\nredbacks (which may be massive as a class) through sensitive broad-band radio\nobservations; and 5) Improve our understanding of dense matter superfluidity\nand the state of matter in the interior through the study of rotational\nglitches, provided that an ad-hoc campaign is developed. \n\n"}

The progenitor is a nonrotating,\nzero-metallicity 9.6 Msun star with an iron core. While in spherical symmetry\noutward shock acceleration sets in later than 300 ms after bounce, a successful\nexplosion starts at ~130 ms postbounce in two dimensions (2D). The 3D model\nexplodes at about the same time but with faster shock expansion than in 2D and\na more quickly increasing and roughly 10 percent higher explosion energy of\n>10^50 erg. The more favorable explosion conditions in 3D are explained by\nlower temperatures and thus reduced neutrino emission in the cooling layer\nbelow the gain radius. This moves the gain radius inward and leads to a bigger\nmass in the gain layer, whose larger recombination energy boosts the explosion\nenergy in 3D. These differences are caused by less coherent, less massive, and\nless rapid convective downdrafts associated with postshock convection in 3D.\nThe less violent impact of these accretion downflows in the cooling layer\nproduces less shock heating and therefore diminishes energy losses by neutrino\nemission.

A natural question is whether the same relations hold for\ndifferent compact objects and how they possibly approach the black-hole limit.\nHere we consider \"gravastars\", which are hypothetical compact objects sustained\nby their internal vacuum energy. Such solutions have been proposed as exotic\nalternatives to the black-hole paradigm because they can be as compact as black\nholes and exist in any mass range. By constructing slowly-rotating, thin-shell\ngravastars to quadratic order in the spin, we compute the moment of inertia\n$I$, the mass quadrupole moment $Q$, and the tidal Love number $\\lambda$ in\nexact form. The $I$-$\\lambda$-$Q$ relations of a gravastar are dramatically\ndifferent from those of an ordinary compact star, but the black-hole limit is\ncontinuous, i.e. these quantities approach their Kerr counterparts when the\ncompactness is maximum.

The fundamental\nchallenge in CCSN theory is to explain how a stalled accretion shock revives to\nexplode a star. In this manuscript, we assume that the shock revival is\ninitiated by the delayed-neutrino mechanism and derive an integral condition\nfor spherically symmetric shock expansion, $v_s > 0$. One of the most useful\none-dimensional explosion conditions is the neutrino luminosity and\nmass-accretion rate ($L_{\\nu}-\\dot{\\mathcal{M}}$) critical curve. Below this\ncurve, steady-state stalled solutions exist, but above this curve, there are no\nstalled solutions. Burrows & Goshy suggested that the solutions above this\ncurve are dynamic and explosive. In this manuscript, we take one step closer to\nproving this supposition; we show that all steady solutions above this curve\nhave $v_s > 0$. Assuming that these steady $v_s > 0$ solutions correspond to\nexplosion, we present a new dimensionless integral condition for explosion,\n$\\Psi > 0$. $\\Psi$ roughly describes the balance between pressure and gravity,\nand we show that this parameter is equivalent to the $\\tau$ condition used to\ninfer the $L_{\\nu}-\\dot{\\mathcal{M}}$ critical curve. The illuminating\ndifference is that there is a direct relationship between $\\Psi$ and $v_s$.\nBelow the critical curve, $\\Psi$ may be negative, positive, and zero, which\ncorresponds to receding, expanding, and stalled-shock solutions. At the\ncritical curve, the minimum $\\Psi$ solution is zero; above the critical curve,\n$\\Psi_{\\rm min} > 0$, and all steady solutions have $v_s > 0$. Using\none-dimensional simulations, we confirm our primary assumptions and verify that\n$\\Psi_{\\rm min} > 0$ is a reliable and accurate explosion diagnostic. \n\n"}

Recent observations of long-lasting X-ray\nafterglows of SGRBs challenge standard paradigms and indicate that in a large\nfraction of events a long-lived neutron star (NS) may be formed rather than a\nblack hole. Understanding the mechanisms underlying these afterglows is\nnecessary in order to address the open questions concerning the nature of SGRB\ncentral engines. However, recent theoretical progress has been hampered by the\nfact that the timescales of interest for the afterglow emission are\ninaccessible to numerical relativity simulations. Here we present a detailed\nmodel to bridge the gap between numerical simulations of the merger process and\nthe relevant timescales for the afterglows, assuming that the merger results in\na long-lived NS. This model is formulated in terms of a set of coupled\ndifferential equations that follow the evolution of the post-merger system and\npredict its electromagnetic (EM) emission in a self-consistent way, starting\nfrom initial data that can be extracted from BNS merger simulations and taking\ninto account the most relevant radiative processes.

At the heart of an AGN is\na relativistic accretion disk around a spinning supermassive black hole (SMBH)\nwith an X-ray emitting corona and, sometimes, a relativistic jet. On larger\nscales, the outer accretion disk and molecular torus act as the reservoirs of\ngas for the continuing AGN activity. And on all scales from the black hole\noutwards, powerful winds are seen that probably affect the evolution of the\nhost galaxy as well as regulate the feeding of the AGN itself. In this review\narticle, we discuss how X-ray spectroscopy can be used to study each of these\ncomponents. We highlight how recent measurements of the high-energy cutoff in\nthe X-ray continuum by NuSTAR are pushing us to conclude that X-ray coronae are\nradiatively-compact and have electron temperatures regulated by\nelectron-positron pair production.

If the\nmolecule is large enough that the frequency of its lowest-frequency phonon lies\nnear or below the rotation frequency, then the rotation couples with the\nmolecular normal modes and energy flows from the former to the latter. The rate\nof this exchange is very fast, and the vibrational energy is radiated away in\nthe IR at a still faster rate, which completes the removal of rotation energy.\nThe energy decay rate scales like the field intensity, the initial angular\nvelocity, the number of atoms in the grain and the inverse of the moment of\ninertia.

In\nparticular, we focus on the lowest-order unstable configuration consisting of\ntwo minima and two maxima of the magnetic vector potential. Breaking of the\ninitial symmetry leads to exponential growth of the electric energy and to the\nformation of two current layers, which is consistent with the picture of\n'X-point collapse' first described by Syrovatskii. Magnetic reconnection within\nthe layers heats a fraction of particles to very high energies. After the\nsaturation of the linear instability, the current layers are disrupted and the\nsystem evolves chaotically, diffusing the particle energies in a stochastic\nsecond-order Fermi process leading to the formation of power-law energy\ndistributions. The power-law slopes harden with the increasing mean\nmagnetization, but they are significantly softer than those produced in\nsimulations initiated from Harris-type layers. The maximum particle energy is\nproportional to the mean magnetization, which is attributed partly to the\nincrease of the effective electric field and partly to the increase of the\nacceleration time scale. We describe in detail the evolving structure of the\ndynamical current layers, and report on the conservation of magnetic helicity.\nThese results can be applied to highly magnetized astrophysical environments,\nwhere ideal plasma instabilities trigger rapid magnetic dissipation with\nefficient particle acceleration and flares of high-energy radiation. \n\n"}

The heavier particle then rapidly decays back to the dark matter\nparticle plus a quasi-monochromatic photon.

In this work we present\nthe first attempt to simulate the accretion process of a fast and dense massive\nstar wind onto a neutron star, taking into account the effects of the\ncentrifugal and magnetic inhibition of accretion (\"gating\") due to the spin and\nmagnetic field of the compact object.

Our calculations\nfollow, as a function of time (on a total time scale of several hours), the\ntransition of the system through all different accretion regimes that are\ntriggered by the intrinsic variations in the density and velocity of the\nnon-stationary wind.

Yet, the compact jet bulk velocity, $v$, is poorly constrained in the\nliterature, $0.07 < v/c < 0.98$.

Below the breaking energy, the Band function\nreduces to a cut-off power law, while above the breaking energy it is a simple\npower law.

The highest velocity blobs are located near\nthe center, while the low velocity ones appear near the edge as expected for a\ngenerally spherical expansion. Systematic uncertainty on the velocity\nmeasurements from gain calibration was assessed by carrying out joint fits of\nindividual blobs with both the ACIS-I and ACIS-S detectors. We determine the\nthree-dimensional kinematics of the Si- and Fe-rich clumps in the southeastern\nquadrant and show that these knots form a distinct, compact, and\nkinematically-connected structure, possibly even a chain of knots strung along\nthe remnant's edge. By examining the viewing geometries we conclude that the\nknots in the southeastern region are unlikely to be responsible for the high\nvelocity Ca II absorption features seen in the light echo spectrum of SN 1572,\nthe originating event for Tycho's SNR. \n\n"}

In this work, we\nintroduce a novel approach to reformulate the EST in matrix formalism. We\npropose that the matrix representation of EST will facilitate the calculations\nin this framework. The method is to discretize the two-dimensional plane of\nvariance and density contrast of EST, where the trajectories for each point in\nthe Universe lived there. The probability of having a density contrast in a\nchosen variance is represented by a probability ket. Naturally, the concept of\nthe transition matrix pops up to define the trajectories. We also define the\nprobability transition rate which is used to obtain the first up-crossing of\ntrajectories and the number count of the structures. In this work we show that\nthe discretization let us study the non-Markov processes by forcing them to\nlook like a Wiener process.

When the parallel component\n$\\bE_\\parallel$ of the surface electric field (under the scenario of a vacuum\nmagnetosphere) of such pulsars approaches 5 \\% of the critical field $E_c =\nm_e^2 c^3/(e\\hbar)$, in strength, the field can readily decay via the Schwinger\nmechanism into electron-positron pairs, the back reaction of which causes\n$\\bE_\\parallel$ to oscillate on a characteristic timescale smaller than the\ndevelopment of a spark gap. Thus, under this scenario, the open field line\nregion of the pulsar magnetosphere is controlled by Schwinger pairs, and their\nlarge creation and acceleration rates enable the escaping pairs to coherently\nemit radio waves directly from the polar cap.

The computation with exact\ntime dependence is sensitive to both infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) effects\nin the loop integrands, and while these effects must cancel because of\ndiffeomorphism invariance, they make numerical computation much less efficient.\nWe provide a formulation of the one-loop, equal-time exact-time-dependence\npower spectrum of density perturbations which is manifestly free of these\nspurious IR and UV divergences at the level of the integrand. We extend our\nresults to the total matter mode with clustering quintessence, show that IR and\nUV divergences cancel, and provide the associated IR- and UV-safe integrand.\nThis also establishes that the consistency conditions are satisfied in this\nsystem. We then use our one-loop result to do an improved precision comparison\nof the two-loop dark-matter power spectrum with the Dark Sky N-body simulation. \n\n"}

X-ray binaries contain accreting neutron stars\nand stellar--mass black holes which are the end points of massive star\nevolution. Studying these remnants thus provides clues to understanding the\nevolutionary processes that lead to their formation. We focus here on the\ndistributions of dynamical masses, space velocities and chemical anomalies of\ntheir companion stars. These three observational features provide unique\ninformation on the physics of core collapse and supernovae explosions within\ninteracting binary systems. There is suggestive evidence for a gap between ~2-5\nMsun in the observed mass distribution. This might be related to the physics of\nthe supernova explosions although selections effects and possible systematics\nmay be important. The difference between neutron star mass measurements in\nlow-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) and pulsar masses in high-mass X-ray binaries\n(HMXBs) reflect their different accretion histories, with the latter presenting\nvalues close to birth masses. On the other hand, black holes in LMXBs appear to\nbe limited to <~12 Msun because of strong mass-loss during the wind Wolf-Rayet\nphase. Detailed studies of a limited sample of black-hole X-ray binaries\nsuggest that the more massive black holes have a lower space velocity, which\ncould be explained if they formed through direct collapse. Conversely, the\nformation of low-mass black holes through a supernova explosion implies that\nlarge escape velocities are possible through ensuing natal and/or Blaauw kicks.\nFinally, chemical abundance studies of the companion stars in seven X-ray\nbinaries indicate they are metal-rich (all except GRO J1655-40) and possess\nlarge peculiar abundances of alpha-elements (Abridged) \n\n"}

These two properties together make massive stars one of the most\nimportant cosmic engines: they trigger the star formation and enrich the\ninterstellar medium with heavy elements, that ultimately leads to formation of\nEarth-like rocky planets and the development of complex life.

Since the formation of such compact remnants releases\nover hundred times more energy in neutrinos than the SN in the explosion,\nneutrinos can be the decisive agents for powering the SN outburst. According to\nthe standard paradigm of the neutrino-driven mechanism, the energy transfer by\nthe intense neutrino flux to the medium behind the stagnating core-bounce\nshock, assisted by violent hydrodynamic mass motions (sometimes subsumed by the\nterm \"turbulence\"), revives the outward shock motion and thus initiates the SN\nblast. Because of the weak coupling of neutrinos in the region of this energy\ndeposition, detailed, multidimensional hydrodynamic models including neutrino\ntransport and a wide variety of physics are needed to assess the viability of\nthe mechanism. Owing to advanced numerical codes and increasing supercomputer\npower, considerable progress has been achieved in our understanding of the\nphysical processes that have to act in concert for the success of\nneutrino-driven explosions.

In this paper we provide evidence that the\nanswer to this interesting question may be positive. In particular, we prove\nthat the recently discovered cloudy Kerr black-hole spacetimes --\nnon-spherically symmetric non-static black holes which support linearized\nmassive scalar fields in their exterior regions -- also respect this no-short\nhair lower bound. Specifically, we analytically derive the lower bound\n$r_{\\text{field}}/r_+>r_+/r_-$ on the effective lengths of the external\nbound-state massive scalar clouds (here $r_{\\text{field}}$ is the peak location\nof the stationary bound-state scalar fields and $r_{\\pm}$ are the horizon radii\nof the black hole). Remarkably, this lower bound is universal in the sense that\nit is independent of the physical parameters (proper mass and angular harmonic\nindices) of the exterior scalar fields. Our results suggest that the lower\nbound $r_{\\text{hair}}>r_{\\text{null}}$ may be a general property of\nasymptotically flat electrically neutral hairy black-hole configurations. \n\n"}

It has been suggested recently that a\nHe-rich WD (a He WD or a hybrid HeCO WD) merges with a CO WD may produce an SN\nIa. This theory was based on the double-detonation model, in which the shock\ncompression in the CO core caused by the surface explosion of the He-rich shell\nmight lead to the explosion of the whole CO WD. However, so far, very few\nbinary population synthesis (BPS) studies have been made on the merger scenario\nof a CO WD and a He-rich WD in the context of SNe Ia.

We take into account the effects of viscosity, which is likely to arise\nin the merger remnant due to magnetohydrodynamical turbulence. As the initial\ncondition, we employ the azimuthally averaged data of the MNS-torus system\nderived in a three-dimensional, numerical-relativity simulation for the binary\nneutron star merger. The viscous effect plays key roles for the remnant\nevolution and mass ejection from it in two phases of the evolution. In the\nfirst $t\\lesssim10$ ms, a differential rotation state of the MNS is changed to\na rigidly rotating state, and as a result, a sound wave, which subsequently\nbecomes a shock wave, is formed in the vicinity of the MNS due to the variation\nof the quasi-equilibrium state of the MNS.

If the kinetic species is an\nenergetic particle (EP) population having negligible mass density but\nsubstantial energy density and the scale size is much larger than the ion and\nelectron inertial lengths, it describes the self-consistent coupling between\nthe magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and the EP dynamics. The\nenergetic-particle-magnetohydrodynamics (EP-MHD) hybrid model is thus a special\ncase of the more general model described in this paper. Advantages of this\napproach over the existing models are discussed. A three-dimensional simulation\ncode solving the proposed set of equations is described. The code combines the\nParticle-in-Cell scheme for solving the kinetic species and a\nRiemann-solver-based code for the two-fluid equations. Several benchmark\nsimulation results are shown to confirm that the code successfully captures the\ndynamics of the EP population interacting self-consistently with the MHD fluid. \n\n"}

Recently reported extraordinary bursts in the methanol\nmaser emission may be the observational signature of accretion events in deeply\nembedded HMYSOs. Aims: We analyze the light curve of 6.7 GHz methanol masers in\nS255IR-NIRS3 during the 2015-2016 burst. Methods: 8.5-year monitoring data with\nan average sampling interval of 5 days were obtained with the Torun 32 m radio\ntelescope. Archival data were added, extending the time series to ~27 years.\nResults: The maser emission showed moderate (25-30%) variability on timescales\nof months to years over ~23 years since its discovery. The main burst was\npreceded by a one-year increase of the total flux density by a factor of 2.5,\nthen it grew by a factor of 10 over ~0.4 years and declined by a factor of 8\nduring the consecutive 2.4 years. The peak maser luminosity was a factor of\n24.5 higher than the pre-burst quiescent value. The light curves of individual\nfeatures showed considerable diversity but indicated a general trend of\nsuppression of the maser emission at blueshifted (<4.7 km s$^{-1}$) velocities\nwhen the redshifted emission rapidly grew and new emission features appeared at\nvelocities >5.8 km s$^{-1}$. This new emission provided a contribution of about\n80% to the maser luminosity around the peak of the burst. Conclusions: The\nonset of the maser burst exactly coincides with that of the infrared burst\nestimated from the motion of the light echo. This strongly supports the\nradiative pumping scheme of the maser transition. The growth of the maser\nluminosity is the result of an increasing volume of gas where the maser\ninversion is achieved. \n\n"}

The composition gradients and boundary layer\nstructure which are produced by our simulations suggest a self-consistent\napproach to boundary layers, removing the need for ad hoc procedures for\n'convective overshooting' and `semi-convection'.

The axion star as coherent state of\naxions with mass $m_a$ generates homogeneous electric field oscillating with\nfrequency $m_a/2\\pi$ under strong magnetic fields. The field makes electrons\ncoherently oscillate and emit the coherent dipole radiations ( FRBs ). The\nradiations stop when thermal fluctuations produced by the oscillation disturb\nthe coherent oscillations. Thus, the duration of the FRBs is determined by the\ntime scale of the thermalization; it is much shorter than $1$ms. Line spectra\nof the dipole radiations are broadened by the thermal effects. The thermally\nbroaden spectra have a feature that the bandwidths $\\delta\\nu$ are proportional\nto their center frequencies $\\nu_c$. The presence of various center frequencies\n( $1.2$GHz$\\sim $$7$GHz ) in repeating FRB 121102 is attributed to Doppler\nshifts owing to the various relativistic velocities of the accretion disk. On\nthe other hand, non repeating FRBs do not show such variety of the center\nfrequencies. They come from the surfaces of neutron stars. The Doppler shift\nalso makes the durations of the bursts with higher frequencies become shorter.\nBecause the magnetic fields of the neutron stars are supposed to be stronger\nthan those of the accretion disks, the peak flux densities of non repeating\nFRBs are larger than those of repeating FRB 121102. The strong magnetic fields\nof the neutron stars also lead to much wide bandwidths of non repeating FRBs,\nwhich are over the extent of the receiver frequency range.

Abstract: Mass accretion rate is a key parameter in accretion disk theory. It\ndetermines black hole accretion mode.

In those simulations, Bondi accretion formula is always used to\nestimate black hole accretion rate. Bondi solution is too simple, which cannot\nrepresent the real accretion process. We perform simulations of hot accretion\nflow at parsec scale irradiated by a low luminosity active galactic nucleus\n(AGN). We perform 77 simulations with varying density and temperature at outer\nboundary (10 parsec). Our purpose is to find a formula to calculate real black\nhole accretion rate based on the gas density and temperature at parsec scale.\nWe define Eddington accretion rate to be $\\dot M_{\\rm Edd}=10L_{\\rm Edd}/c^2$,\nwith $L_{\\rm Edd}$ and $c$ been Eddington luminosity and speed of light\nrespectively.

In this work we use\ndata from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope and consider a specific\nphotospheric model, in which kinetic energy of a low-magnetisation outflow is\ndissipated locally by internal shocks below the photosphere. We construct a\ntable model with a physically motivated parameter space and fit it to\ntime-resolved spectra of the 36 brightest Fermi GRBs with known redshift. We\nfind that about two thirds of the examined spectra cannot be described by the\nmodel, as it typically under-predicts the observed flux. However, since the\nsample is strongly biased towards bright GRBs, we argue that this fraction will\nbe significantly lowered when considering the full population. From the\nsuccessful fits we find that the model can reproduce the full range of spectral\nslopes present in the sample. For these cases we also find that the dissipation\nconsistently occurs at a radius of $\\sim 10^{12}$ cm and that only a few\npercent efficiency is required.

Through gravothermal\nevolution driven by collisional relaxation, an SIDM halo will form a massive\ninner core whose density and velocity dispersion will increase secularly in\ntime. Eventually, the inner core arrives at a relativistic radial instability\nand undergoes dynamical collapse to a black hole. The initial mass of the black\nhole will be $10^{-8}-10^{-6}$ of the total mass of the halo. We show that if\nat formation the overdensity in the SIDM halo is not too large, SMBHs in the\nobserved mass range can form directly in very massive halos following core\ncollapse. Alternatively, with large overdensities, moderate mass halos undergo\ncore collapse to form central seed black holes of intermediate mass, and these\nholes can then merge and/or accrete to reach the SMBH range. Forming SMBHs by\ncore collapse in SIDM halos requires no baryons, no prior epoch of star\nformation and no other mechanism of forming black holes seeds. \n\n"}

The Pearson correlation coefficient between the\nlogarithm of the Sersic index `n' and the host galaxy magnitude is -0.77 at a\nsignificance of 99.9%.

Using a rapid binary evolution\nalgorithm, that enables us to model the most complex binary systems and to\nexplore the effect of metallicity on GRB production, we draw the following\nconclusions. First we find that, if we include an approximate treatment of\nangular momentum transport by mass loss, the resulting spin rates for single\nstars become too low to form a centrifugally supported disc that can drive a\nGRB engine. Second massive stars in binaries result in enough angular momentum\n-- due to spin-orbit tidal interactions -- to form a centrifugally supported\ndisc and are thus capable of supplying a sufficient number of progenitors. This\nholds true even if only a small fraction of bursts are visible to a given\nobserver and the GRB rate is several hundred times larger than the observed\nrate. Third low-metallicity stars aid the formation of a rapidly rotating,\nmassive helium cores at collapse and so their evolution is likely to be\naffected by the local properties of the ISM.

These multiple\nimages are very useful to constrain accurately the mass distribution in the\ncluster core, but they are also sensitive to the value of the geometrical\ncosmological parameters of the Universe.

Abstract: Nova explosions occur on the white dwarf (WD) component of a Cataclysmic\nVariable stellar system which is accreting matter lost by a companion. A Type\nIa supernova explosion is thought to result when a WD, in a similar binary\nconfiguration, grows in mass to the Chandrasekhar Limit. Here, we present\ncalculations of accretion of Solar matter, at a variety of mass accretion\nrates, onto hot ($2.3 \\times 10^{5}$K), luminous (30L$_\\odot$), massive\n(1.25M$_\\odot$, 1.35M$_\\odot$) Carbon-Oxygen WDs. In contrast to our nova\nsimulations where the WD has a low initial luminosity and a thermonuclear\nrunaway (TNR) occurs and ejects material, these simulations do not eject\nmaterial (or only a small fraction of the accreted material) and the WD grows\nin mass. A hydrogen TNR does not occur because hydrogen fuses to helium in the\nsurface layers, and we call this process Surface Hydrogen Burning (SHB). As the\nhelium layer grows in mass, it gradually fuses either to carbon and oxygen or\nto more massive nuclei depending on the WD mass and mass accretion rate. If\nsuch a WD were to explode in a SN Ia event, therefore, it would show neither\nhydrogen nor helium in its spectrum as is observed. Moreover, the luminosities\nand effective temperatures of our simulations agree with the observations of\nsome of the Super Soft X-ray Binary Sources and, therefore, our results\nstrengthen previous speculation that some of them (CAL 83 and CAL 87 for\nexample) are probably progenitors of SN Ia explosions.

Correlations between optical indices and the polarization\ndegree p_0 are systematically searched for. In order to identify the most\nimportant correlations, we perform a principal component analysis with a sample\nof 30 BAL QSOs and eight quantities (including p_0). Most of the variance in\nthe data is contained in two principal components (PC): PC1 is mainly dominated\nby the correlation between the balnicity index BI and the strength of the feii\nemission, and may be driven by the accretion rate of matter onto the central\ncompact object. The variance in PC2 is essentially due to the anti-correlation\nbetween p_0 and the detachment index DI. PC2 may be related to the orientation\nof the BAL QSOs with respect to the line of sight. We also consider a\nspectropolarimetric sample of 21 BAL QSOs for which we define four indices\ndescribing the polarization properties of the absorption and emission lines.

Here, we consider the\npossible effects of these powerful explosions on the structure of the accretion\ndisk. The goal is to account for the apparent evolution of the innermost\nregions of the accretion disk around 4U 1820-30 during a superburst. Three\ndifferent processes are considered in detail: radiatively or thermally driven\noutflows, inflow due to Poynting-Robertson drag, and a structural change to the\ndisk by X-ray heating. Radiatively driven winds with large column densities can\nbe launched from the inner disk, but only for L/L_{Edd} >~ 1, which is expected\nto be obtained only at the onset of the burst. Furthermore, the predicted mass\noutflow rate is less than the accretion rate in 4U 1820-30. Estimates of the\nPoynting-Robertson or radiative drag timescale shows that it is a very\nefficient means of removing angular momentum from the gas. However, the\nanalytical results are likely only applicable at the innermost edge of the\ndisk. X-ray heating gives a change in the disk scale height that is correlated\nwith the blackbody temperature, as seen in the evolution during the 4U 1820-30\nsuperburst. If this change in the scale height can alter the surface density,\nthen the viscous time (with \\alpha ~ 0.03-0.2) is the closest match to the 4U\n1820-30 results. We expect, however, that all three processes are likely\nongoing when an accretion disk is subject to a sudden heating event.\nUltimately, a numerical simulation of a disk around a bursting neutron star is\nrequired to determine the exact response of the disk. Magnetic truncation of\nthe accretion flow is also considered and applied to the 4U 1820-30 X-ray\nreflection results. \n\n"}

Thus it is found that X-ray bright and faint elliptical\ngalaxies are clearly distinguished by the temperature and gas density profile.\nThe mass profile is well scaled by a virial radius $r_{200}$ rather than an\noptical-half radius $r_e$, and is quite similar at $(0.001-0.03)r_{200}$\nbetween X-ray luminous and dim galaxies, and smoothly connects to those of\nclusters of galaxies. At the inner region of $(0.001-0.01)r_{200}$ or\n$(0.1-1)r_e$, the mass profile well traces a stellar mass with a constant\nmass-to-light ratio of $M/L_{\\rm B}=3-10(M_{\\odot}/L_{\\odot})$. $M/L_{\\rm B}$\nratio of X-ray bright galaxies rises up steeply beyond $0.01r_{200}$, and thus\nrequires a presence of massive dark matter halo. From the deprojection analysis\ncombined with the {\\it XMM-Newton} data, we found that X-ray dim galaxies, NGC\n3923, NGC 720, and IC 1459, also have a high $M/L_{\\rm B}$ ratio of 20--30 at\n20 kpc, comparable to that of X-ray luminous galaxies. Therefore, dark matter\nis indicated to be common in elliptical galaxies, and their distribution almost\nfollows the NFW profile, as well as galaxy clusters. \n\n"}

The efficiency and duty cycle of the star formation activity within dark\nmatter halos are determined by fitting the luminosity functions of Lya emitter\nand Lyman-break galaxies at redshifts z~5-6. Using our model parameters we\npredict the likely abundance of star forming galaxies at earlier epochs and\ncompare these to the emerging data in the redshift interval 7<z<10. We find\nthat the abundance of luminous Lyman-break galaxies in the 500 Myr between z~6\nand 10 can be naturally explained by the hierarchical assembly of dark matter\nhaloes; there is only marginal evidence for strong physical evolution. In\ncontrast, the first estimates of the abundance of less luminous star forming\ngalaxies at z=9-10 are higher than predicted and, if verified by further data,\nmay suggest a top-heavy stellar mass function at these early epochs. Although\nthese abundances remain uncertain because of the difficulty of spectroscopic\nconfirmation and cosmic variance, even a modest improvement in survey\ncapability with present or upcoming facilities should yield great progress. In\nthis context, we use our model to consider those observational techniques that\nhold the most promise and make predictions for specific surveys that are, or\nwill soon be, underway. We conclude that narrowband Lya emitter surveys should\nbe efficient on searches at z~7-8; however, such conventional surveys are\nunlikely to detect sufficient galaxies at z~10 to provide useful constraints.\nFor this reason, gravitational lensing offers the best prospect for probing the\nz~10 universe prior to JWST. \n\n"}
