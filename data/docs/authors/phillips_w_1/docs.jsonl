Here we study interactions in an optically trapped mixture\nof such halo dimers with atoms, realized in a caesium gas at nanokelvin\ntemperatures. We observe an atom-dimer scattering resonance, which we interpret\nas being due to a trimer state hitting the atom-dimer threshold. We discuss the\nclose relation of this observation to Efimov's scenario, and in particular to\natom-dimer Efimov resonances. \n\n"}

While the attractive Hubbard\nmodel can be regarded as the generalization of BCS to Bose Einstein\ncondensation (BEC) crossover to a lattice, we find that the BEC limit of this\nHubbard model is very different from that of jellium, owing to the strong\ninter-site repulsion between pairs, which becomes important near half filling\nwhen the on-site attraction is strong. A central conclusion of our work is that\nin a lattice, around half filling, the smooth evolution from the BCS to the BEC\nlimits is interrupted. For the attractive Hubbard model, $T_c$ vanishes when\nthe system approaches the bosonic regime with increasing interaction strength.\nWe suggest that the vanishing of $T_c$ at strong coupling strength may signal a\nquantum critical transition to another form of superfluid not continuously\nconnected to a BCS-like phase.

An analysis of the various derivations extant in the literature\nleads me to formulate an asymptotic expansion in which the metric is expanded\nwhile a representative worldline is held fixed; I discuss the utility of this\nexpansion for both exact point particles and asymptotically small bodies,\ncontrasting it with a regular expansion in which both the metric and the\nworldline are expanded. Based on these preliminary analyses, I present a\ngeneral method of deriving self-consistent equations of motion for arbitrarily\nstructured (sufficiently compact) small bodies. My method utilizes two\nexpansions: an inner expansion that keeps the size of the body fixed, and an\nouter expansion that lets the body shrink while holding its worldline fixed. By\nimposing the Lorenz gauge, I express the global solution to the Einstein\nequation in the outer expansion in terms of an integral over a worldtube of\nsmall radius surrounding the body. Appropriate boundary data on the tube are\ndetermined from a local-in-space expansion in a buffer region where both the\ninner and outer expansions are valid. This buffer-region expansion also results\nin an expression for the self-force in terms of irreducible pieces of the\nmetric perturbation on the worldline. Based on the global solution, these\npieces of the perturbation can be written in terms of a tail integral over the\nbody's past history. This approach can be applied at any order to obtain a\nself-consistent approximation that is valid on long timescales, both near and\nfar from the small body. I conclude by discussing possible extensions of my\nmethod and comparing it to alternative approaches. \n\n"}

The effective Hamitonian is the analogue to the first graphene\nquantum spin Hall effect (QSHE) Hamiltonian. Similar to graphene model, the\neffective SOC in low-buckled geometry opens a gap at Dirac points and\nestablishes QSHE. The effective SOC actually contains first order in the atomic\nintrinsic SOC strength $\\xi_{0}$, while such leading order contribution of SOC\nvanishes in planar structure. Therefore, silicene as well as low-buckled\ncounterparts of graphene for other group IVA elements Ge and Sn has much larger\ngap opened by effective SOC at Dirac points than graphene due to low-buckled\ngeometry and larger atomic intrinsic SOC strength. Further, the more buckled is\nthe structure, the greater is the gap. Therefore, QSHE can be observed in\nlow-buckled Si, Ge, and Sn systems in an experimentally accessible temperature\nregime.

Yet with this\nprogress, several unpalatable coincidences (perhaps even inconsistencies) have\nemerged along with the successful confirmation of expected features. One of\nthese is the observed equality of our gravitational horizon R_h(t_0) with the\ndistance ct_0 light has traveled since the big bang, in terms of the current\nage t_0 of the universe. This equality is very peculiar because it need not\nhave occurred at all and, if it did, should only have happened once (right now)\nin the context of LambdaCDM.

Under degeneracy of the electron gas (high concentration, low\ntemperature), a dip at the center of the polarization profile appears with a\npolarization maximum at a distance of about $2 \\; \\mu m$ from the center. This\ncounterintuitive result reveals that photoelectron diffusion depends on spin,\nas a direct consequence of the Pauli principle.

Such features are generally described in terms of multi-dimensional\nquadratic expansions and corresponding definitions of effective masses.\nMulti-dimensional expansions, however, are permissible only under strict\nconditions that are typically violated by degenerate bands and even some\nnon-degenerate bands. Suggestive terms such as \"band warping\" or \"corrugated\nenergy surfaces\" have been used to refer to such situations and ad hoc methods\nhave been developed to treat them. While numerical calculations may reflect\nsuch features, a complete theory of band warping has not been developed. We\ndevelop a generally applicable theory, based on radial expansions, and a\ncorresponding definition of angular effective mass. Our theory also accounts\nfor effects of band non-parabolicity and anisotropy, which hitherto have not\nbeen precisely distinguished from, if not utterly confused with, band warping.\nBased on our theory, we develop precise procedures to evaluate band warping\nquantitatively.

However Shannon's theory of information does not provide\nformulae to fully determine these quantities. Several recent studies have begun\naddressing this. Some possible definitions for PID quantities have been\nproposed, and some analyses have been carried out on systems composed of\ndiscrete variables. Here we present the first in-depth analysis of PIDs on\nGaussian systems, both static and dynamical. We show that, for a broad class of\nGaussian systems, previously proposed PID formulae imply that: (i) redundancy\nreduces to the minimum information provided by either source variable, and\nhence is independent of correlation between sources; (ii) synergy is the extra\ninformation contributed by the weaker source when the stronger source is known,\nand can either increase or decrease with correlation between sources. We find\nthat Gaussian systems frequently exhibit net synergy, i.e. the information\ncarried jointly by both sources is greater than the sum of informations carried\nby each source individually. Drawing from several explicit examples, we discuss\nthe implications of these findings for measures of information transfer and\ninformation-based measures of complexity, both generally and within a\nneuroscience setting. Importantly, by providing independent formulae for\nsynergy and redundancy applicable to continuous time-series data, we open up a\nnew approach to characterizing and quantifying information sharing amongst\ncomplex system variables. \n\n"}

The experiments reported here measure correlations on time scales from 4\n$\\mu$s to 2 ms. When the magnetic field is aligned in a direction such that\nspin-orbit coupling cannot cause spin flips, the correlation spectrum has\nprominent peaks centered at zero frequency and at the differences of the Larmor\nfrequencies of the nuclei, on top of a frequency-independent background. When\nthe spin-orbit field is relevant, there are additional peaks, centered at the\nfrequencies of the individual species. A theoretical model which neglects the\neffects of high-frequency charge noise correctly predicts the positions of the\nobserved peaks, and gives a reasonably accurate prediction of the size of the\nfrequency-independent background, but gives peak areas that are larger than the\nobserved areas by a factor of two or more.

We identified which spectral features of the quantum Rabi model survive\nand which are renormalized for large coupling. Despite significant\nrenormalization of the low-energy spectrum in the fluxonium case, the key\nquantum Rabi feature -- nearly-degenerate vacuum consisting of an atomic state\nentangled with a multi-photon field -- appears in both types of circuits when\nthe coupling is sufficiently large.

However, there are\nmany indications that one dimensional spin systems are simpler than their\nhigher-dimensional counterparts: for example, they cannot have thermal phase\ntransitions or topological order, and there exist highly-effective numerical\nalgorithms such as DMRG - and even provably polynomial-time ones - for gapped\n1D systems, exploiting the fact that such systems obey an entropy area-law.\nFurthermore, the spectral gap undecidability construction crucially relied on\naperiodic tilings, which are not possible in 1D.\n  So does the spectral gap problem become decidable in 1D?

At the beginning, a given amount\n$p(i)$ of resources is assigned randomly to each node $i$. Also, each link\n$r(i,j)$ is initially represented by a random positive value, which means the\npercentage of resources of node $i$ which is offered to node $j$. Initially\nthen, the graph is fully connected, i.e. all non-diagonal matrix elements\n$r(i,j)$ are different from zero. During the simulation, the amounts of\nresources $p(i)$ change according to the balance equation. Also, nodes\nreorganise their activity with time, going to give more resources to those\nwhich give them more. This is the rule of varying the coefficients $r(i,j)$.\nThe result is that after some transient time, only some pairs $(m,n)$ of nodes\nsurvive with non-zero $p(m)$ and $p(n)$, each pair with symmetric and positive\n$r(m,n)=r(n,m)$. Other coefficients $r(m,i\\ne n)$ vanish. Unpaired nodes remain\nwith no resources, i.e. their $p(i)=0$, and they cease to be active, as they\nhave nothing to offer. The percentage of survivors (i.e. those with with $p(i)$\npositive) increases with the velocity of varying the numbers $r(i,j)$, and it\nslightly decreases with the size of the group.

A linear power law $Gamma\\propto\nalpha$ is obtained when the initial molecular fraction is smaller than the 1/N\nquantum fluctuations, and a cubic-root power law $Gamma\\propto alpha^{1/3}$ is\nattained when it is larger. Our mean-field analysis is confirmed by exact\ncalculations, using Fock-space expansions. Finally, we fit experimental low\ntemperature Feshbach sweep data with a power-law dependence. While the\nagreement with the experimental data is well within experimental error bars,\nsimilar accuracy can be obtained with an exponential fit, making additional\ndata highly desirable. \n\n"}

In the theory, there are two equivalent ways to define the\nprogram-size complexity H(s) of a given finite binary string s. In the standard\nway, H(s) is defined as the length of the shortest input string for U to output\ns.

Interference is studied when electrons\nor atomic systems are coupled to classical or quantum electromagnetic fields.\nThe interaction between the particles and time-dependent fields induces a\ntime-varying Aharonov phase. Averaging over the phase generates a suppression\nof fringe visibility in the interference pattern. We show that, for suitable\nexperimental conditions, the loss of contrast for dipoles can be almost as\nlarge as the corresponding one for coherent electrons and therefore, be\nobserved. We analyze different trajectories in order to show the dependence of\nthe decoherence factor with the velocity of the particles. \n\n"}
{"id": "quant-ph/0606095", "contents": "Title: Entangled spin clusters: some special features Abstract: In this paper, we study three specific aspects of entanglement in small spin\nclusters. We first study the effect of inhomogeneous exchange coupling strength\non the entanglement properties of the S=1/2 antiferromagnetic linear chain\ntetramer compound NaCuAsO_{4}. The entanglement gap temperature, T_{E}, is\nfound to have a non-monotonic dependence on the value of $\\alpha$, the exchange\ncoupling inhomogeneity parameter. We next determine the variation of T_{E} as a\nfunction of S for a spin dimer, a trimer and a tetrahedron. The temperature\nT_{E} is found to increase as a function of S, but the scaled entanglement gap\ntemperature t_{E} goes to zero as S becomes large. Lastly, we study a spin-1\ndimer compound to illustrate the quantum complementarity relation. We show that\nin the experimentally realizable parameter region, magnetization and\nentanglement plateaus appear simultaneously at low temperatures as a function\nof the magnetic field. Also, the sharp increase in one quantity as a function\nof the magnetic field is accompanied by a sharp decrease in the other so that\nthe quantum complementarity relation is not violated. \n\n"}

Gate count and\ntechnology oriented cost metrics are used. Our synthesis techniques are\nindependent of the cost metrics. Two new iterative synthesis procedure\nemploying Reed-Muller spectra are introduced and shown to complement earlier\nsynthesis approaches. The template simplification suggested in earlier work is\nenhanced through introduction of a faster and more efficient template\napplication algorithm, updated (shorter) classification of the templates, and\npresentation of the new templates of sizes 7 and 9. A novel ``resynthesis''\napproach is introduced wherein a sequence of gates is chosen from a network,\nand the reversible specification it realizes is resynthesized as an independent\nproblem in hopes of reducing the network cost. Empirical results are presented\nto show that the methods are effective both in terms of the realization of all\n3x3 reversible functions and larger reversible benchmark specifications. \n\n"}

If one estimates in an experiment an expectation value smaller than\nzero, one can directly infer that the state has been entangled, or specifically\nmulti-partite entangled, in the first place. In this article, we emphasize that\nall these tests - based on the very same data - give rise to quantitative\nestimates in terms of entanglement measures: \"If a test is strongly violated,\none can also infer that the state was quantitatively very much entangled\". We\nconsider various measures of entanglement, including the negativity, the\nentanglement of formation, and the robustness of entanglement, in the bipartite\nand multipartite setting. As examples, we discuss several experiments in the\ncontext of quantum state preparation that have recently been performed. \n\n"}

In fact, the Casimir force is similar to the familiar van der\nWaals force in the case of relatively large separations when the relativistic\neffects come into play. We review the most important experiments on measuring\nthe Casimir force by means of torsion pendulum, atomic force microscope and\nmicromechanical torsional oscillator. Special attention is paid to the puzzle\nof the thermal Casimir force, i.e., to the apparent violation of the third law\nof thermodynamics when the Lifshitz theory of dispersion forces is applied to\nreal metals. Thereafter we discuss the role of the Casimir force in nanosystems\nincluding the stiction phenomenon, actuators, and interaction of hydrogen atoms\nwith carbon nanotubes.

The microsystem evolution is then described by tracing\nover the reservoir states, resulting in an irreversible decay as excitation\nleaks out of the initially excited microsystems into the outer reservoir\nenvironment.
