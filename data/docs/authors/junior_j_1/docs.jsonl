Its forces may be suppressed\njust below the current bounds by the chameleon-like mimicry, whereby only outer\nlayers of mass distributions, of thickness $1/m_\\phi$, give off appreciable\nlong range forces. After inflation and reheating, the field is relativistic,\nand attains a Planckian expectation value before Hubble friction freezes it.\nThis can make gravity in space slightly stronger than on Earth.

We prove that in the neighborhood of the soliton\nmanifold there exists a H^{1/2} real analytic manifold N of asymptotically\nstable solutions of the Schroedinger equation, meaning they are the sum of a\nmoving soliton and a dispersive term. Furthermore, a solution starting on N\nremains on N for all positive time and for some finite negative time and N can\nbe identified as the centre-stable manifold for this equation. The proof is\nbased on the method of modulation, introduced by Soffer and Weinstein and\nadapted by Schlag to the L^2-supercritical case.

Abstract: We investigate the effects of the presence of relic classical superhorizon\ninhomogeneities during inflation.

Quantum fluctuations on\nthis slightly inhomogeneous background are generally statistical anisotropic.\nWe find a quadrupole modification to the ordinary isotropic spectrum. Moreover,\nthis deviation from statistical isotropy is scale-dependent, with a $\\sim\n-1/k^2$ factor. This result implies that the statistical anisotropy mainly\nappears on large scales, while the spectrum on small scales remains highly\nisotropic. Moreover, due to this $-1/k^2$ factor, the power on large scales is\nsuppressed. Thus, our model can simultaneously explain the observed anisotropic\nalignments of the low-$\\ell$ multipoles and their low power. \n\n"}

I estimate a planet-to-star radii ratio of\n0.1433 +/- 0.0010, a ratio of the planet's orbital semimajor axis to the host\nstar radius of 4.751 +/- 0.045, and an orbital inclination for the planet of\n83.88 +/- 0.29 deg. The observed transit times are consistent with CoRoT-1b\nhaving a constant period and there is no evidence of an additional planet in\nthe system. I use the observed constancy of the transit times to set limits on\nthe mass of a hypothetical additional planet in a nearby, stable orbit. I\nascertain that the most stringent limits (4 M_earth at 3 sigma confidence) can\nbe placed on planets residing in a 1:2 mean motion resonance with the\ntransiting planet. In contrast, the data yield less stringent limits on planets\nnear a 1:3 mean motion resonance (5 M_jup at 3 sigma confidence) than in the\nsurrounding parameter space. In addition, I use a simulation to investigate\nwhat sensitivity to additional planets could be obtained from the analysis of\ndata measured for a similar system during a CoRoT long run (100 sequential\ntransit times).

Given observational constraints at the current time for a\ngiven planet (semi-major axis, eccentricity, and system age) we find possible\nevolutionary paths that match these constraints, and compare the calculated\nradii to observations. We find that tidal evolution has two effects. First,\nplanets start their evolution at larger semi-major axis, allowing them to\ncontract more efficiently at earlier times. Second, tidal heating can\nsignificantly inflate the radius when the orbit is being circularized, but this\neffect on the radius is short-lived thereafter. Often circularization of the\norbit is proceeded by a long period while the semi-major axis slowly decreases.\nSome systems with previously unexplained large radii that we can reproduce with\nour coupled model are HAT-P-7, HAT-P-9, WASP-10, and XO-4.

In this study, we present useful tools to\nstudy the coagulation and porosity evolution of dust aggregates. First, we\npresent a new numerical method for simulating dust coagulation and porosity\nevolution as an extension of the conventional Smoluchowski equation. This\nmethod follows the evolution of the mean porosity for each aggregate mass\nsimultaneously with the evolution of the mass distribution function. This\nmethod reproduces the results of previous Monte Carlo simulations with much\nless computational expense. Second, we propose a new collision model for porous\ndust aggregates on the basis of our N-body experiments on aggregate collisions.\nWe first obtain empirical data on porosity changes between the classical limits\nof ballistic cluster-cluster and particle-cluster aggregation. Using the data,\nwe construct a recipe for the porosity change due to general hit-and-stick\ncollisions as well as formulae for the aerodynamical and collisional cross\nsections. Simple coagulation simulations using the extended Smoluchowski method\nshow that our collision model explains the fractal dimensions of porous\naggregates observed in a full N-body simulation and a laboratory experiment.\nBesides, we discover that aggregates at the high-mass end of the distribution\ncan have a considerably small aerodynamical cross section per unit mass\ncompared with aggregates of lower masses.

The data suggest that the turbulent\ndiffusive magnetic helicity flux can only be expected to alleviate catastrophic\nquenching at Reynolds numbers of more than several thousands.

Given Mp, Rp, and equilibrium temperature, however, various\ninternal compositions are possible. A broad set of interior structure models is\npresented here that illustrates the dependence of internal composition and\npossible phases of water occurring in presumably water-rich planets, such as GJ\n436b on the uncertainty in atmospheric temperature profile and mean density. We\nshow how the set of solutions can be narrowed down if theoretical constraints\nfrom formation and model atmospheres are applied or potentially observational\nconstraints for the atmospheric metallicity Z1 and the tidal Love number k2. We\nmodel the interior by assuming either three layers (hydrogen-helium envelope,\nwater layer, rock core) or two layers (H/He/H2O envelope, rocky core). For\nwater, we use the equation of state H2O-REOS based on FT-DFT-MD simulations.\nSome admixture of H/He appears mandatory for explaining the measured radius.\nFor the warmest considered models, the H/He mass fraction can reduce to 10^-3,\nstill extending over ~0.7 REarth. If water occurs, it will be essentially in\nthe plasma phase or in the superionic phase, but not in an ice phase.\nMetal-free envelope models have 0.02<k2<0.2, and the core mass cannot be\ndetermined from a measurement of k2.

Abstract: The decay of non-topological electroweak strings formed during the\nelectroweak phase transition in the early universe may leave an observable\nimprint in the universe today. Such strings can naturally seed primordial\nmagnetic fields. Protogalaxies then tend to form with their axis of rotation\nparallel to the external magnetic field, and moreover, the external magnetic\nfield produces torque which forces the galaxy axis to align with the magnetic\nfield, even if the two axis were not aligned initially.

In such models, a(Q^2) usually differs from its perturbative\nanalog by power terms ~(Lambda^2/Q^2)^k for large momenta, introducing thus\nnonperturbative terms in spacelike physical quantities whose origin is the UV\nregime.

If the dynamo is in a diffusion-dominated regime,\nthen we find that most of the cycle amplitudes also get modeled up to some\nextent when we model the periods. Next, we propose that at the beginning of the\nMaunder minimum the amplitude of meridional circulation dropped to a low value\nand then after a few years it increased again. Several independent studies also\nfavor this assumption. With this assumption, a diffusion-dominated dynamo is\nable to reproduce many important features of the Maunder minimum remarkably\nwell. If the dynamo is in a diffusion-dominated regime, then a slower\nmeridional circulation means that the poloidal field gets more time to diffuse\nduring its transport through the convection zone, making the dynamo weaker.\nThis consequence helps to model both the cycle amplitudes and the Maunder-like\nminima.

However, there is a potential transition phase (which we\ncall the \"snowball phase\"), between the formation of the first planetesimals\nand the onset of mutual collisions amongst them, which has often been either\nignored or underestimated in previous studies.

Empirical comparisons to field brown dwarfs show that at least\nHR 8799b and HR8799c, and possibly HR 8799d, have near-to-mid IR\ncolors/magnitudes significantly discrepant from the L/T dwarf sequence.\nStandard cloud deck atmosphere models appropriate for brown dwarfs provide only\n(marginally) statistically meaningful fits to HR 8799b and c for unphysically\nsmall radii. Models with thicker cloud layers not present in brown dwarfs\nreproduce the planets' SEDs far more accurately and without the need for\nrescaling the planets' radii. Our preliminary modeling suggests that HR 8799b\nhas log(g) = 4--4.5, Teff = 900K, while HR 8799c, d, and (by inference) e have\nlog(g) = 4--4.5, Teff = 1000--1200K. Combining results from planet evolution\nmodels and new dynamical stability limits implies that the masses of HR 8799b,\nc, d, and e are 6--7 Mj, 7--10 Mj, 7--10 Mj and 7--10 Mj. 'Patchy\" cloud\nprescriptions may provide even better fits to the data and may lower the\nestimated surface gravities and masses. Finally, contrary to some recent\nclaims, forming the HR 8799 planets by core accretion is still plausible,\nalthough such systems are likely rare. \n\n"}

Such a paucity is not seen in the case of 1 M_sun\nmain sequence stars. In this study, we examine the possibility that\nshort-period planets were engulfed by their host star evolving off the main\nsequence. To do so, we have simulated the orbital evolution of planets,\nincluding the effects of stellar tide and mass loss, to determine the critical\nsemimajor axis, a_crit, beyond which planets survive the RGB expansion of their\nhost star. We have found that a_crit changes drastically around 2 M_sun: In the\nlower-mass range, a_crit is more than 1 AU, while a_crit is as small as about\n0.2 AU in the higher-mass range. Comparison with measured semimajor axes of\nknown planets suggests that there is a lack of planets that only planet\nengulfment never accounts for in the higher-mass range. Whether the lack is\nreal affects our understanding of planet formation. Therefore, increasing the\nnumber of planet samples around evolved intermediate-mass stars is quite\nmeaningful to confirm robustness of the lack of planets. \n\n"}

The aim is to examine\nwhether or not resonant trapping can occur and be maintained in presence of\nturbulence and how this depends on the amplitude of the stochastic density\nfluctuations in the disk. We have performed 2D numerical simulations using a\ngrid-based hydrodynamical code in which turbulence is modelled as stochastic\nforcing. We assume that the outermost planet is initially located just outside\nthe position of the 3:2 mean motion resonance (MMR) with the inner one and we\nstudy the dependance of the resonance stability with the amplitude of the\nstochastic forcing. For systems of two equal-mass planets we find that in disk\nmodels with an effective viscous stress parameter {\\alpha} 10^{-3}, damping\neffects due to type I migration can counteract the effects of diffusion of the\nresonant angles, in such a way that the 3:2 MMR can possibly remain stable over\nthe disk lifetime. For systems of super-Earths with mass ratio q=m_i/m_o < 1/2,\nwhere m_i (m_o) is the mass of the innermost (outermost) planet, the 3:2 MMR is\nbroken in turbulent disks with effective viscous stresses 2x10^{-4}< {\\alpha}<\n10^{-3} but the planets become locked in stronger p+1:p resonances, with p\nincreasing as the value for {\\alpha} increases.

{"id": "1107.2929", "contents": "Title: Gravitationally Induced Density Wake of a Circularly Orbiting Object As\n  an Interpretative Framework of Ubiquitous Spirals and Arcs Abstract: An orbiting object in a gas rich environment creates a gravitational density\nwake containing information about the object and its orbit. Using linear\nperturbation theory, we analyze the observable properties of the gravitational\nwake due to the object circularly moving in a static homogeneous gaseous\nmedium, in order to derive the Bondi accretion radius $r_B$, the orbital\ndistance $r_p$, and the Mach number of the object. Supersonic motion, producing\na wake of spiral-onion shell structure, exhibits a single-armed Archimedes\nspiral and two-centered circular arcs with respect to the line of sight. The\npitch angle, arm width, and spacing of the spiral pattern are entirely\ndetermined by the orbital distance $r_p$ and Mach number of the object. The\narm-interarm density contrast is proportional to the Bondi accretion radius,\ndecreasing as a function of distance with a power index of -1. The background\ndensity distribution is globally changed from initially uniform to centrally\nconcentrated. The vertical structure of the wake is manifested as circular arcs\nwith the center at the object location. The angular extent of the arcs is\ndetermined by the Mach number of the object motion. Diagnostic probes of\nnonlinear wakes such as a detached bow shock, an absence of the definite inner\narm boundary, the presence of turbulent low density eddies, and elongated\nshapes of arcs are explained in the extension of the linear analysis. The\ndensity enhancement at the center is always $r_B/r_p$ independent of the\nnonlinearity, suggesting that massive objects can substantially modify the\nbackground distribution. These detailed understanding of the wake\ncharacteristics will provide an interpretative framework for both further\ntheoretical works under more complicated situations and future observations to\ndetect the gravitational wakes of hidden objects. \n\n"}

Under these assumptions, we use the vectorfield\nenergy method to prove that an explicit family of physically motivated,\nspatially homogeneous, and spatially isotropic fluid solutions is globally\nfuture-stable under small perturbations of their initial conditions. The\nexplicit solutions corresponding to each scale factor are analogs of the\nwell-known spatially flat Friedmann-Lema\\^{\\i}tre-Robertson-Walker family. Our\nnonlinear analysis, which exploits dissipative terms generated by the\nexpansion, shows that the perturbed solutions exist for all future times and\nremain close to the explicit solutions.

We derive\nanalytical formulae for their TTV signals. We separate planet eccentricity into\nfree and forced parts, where the forced part is purely due to the planets'\nproximity to resonance. This separation yields simple analytical formulae. The\nphase of the TTV depends sensitively on the presence of free eccentricity: if\nthe free eccentricity vanishes, the TTV will be in phase with the longitude of\nconjunctions. This effect is easily detectable in current TTV data. The\namplitude of the TTV depends on planet mass and free eccentricity, and it\ndetermines planet mass uniquely only when the free eccentricity is sufficiently\nsmall. We proceed to analyze the TTV signals of six short period Kepler pairs.\nWe find that three of these pairs (Kepler-18,24,25) have TTV phase consistent\nwith zero. The other three (Kepler-23,28,32) have small TTV phases, but ones\nthat are distinctly non-zero. We deduce that the free eccentricities of the\nplanets are small, < 0.01, but not always vanishing. Furthermore, as a\nconsequence of this, we deduce that the true masses of the planets are fairly\naccurately determined by the TTV amplitudes, within a factor < 2. The smallness\nof the free eccentricities suggests that the planets have experienced\nsubstantial dissipation. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the\nobserved pile-up of Kepler pairs near mean-motion resonances is caused by\nresonant repulsion. But the fact that some of the planets have non-vanishing\nfree eccentricity suggests that after resonant repulsion occurred there was a\nsubsequent phase in the planets' evolution when their eccentricities were\nmodestly excited, perhaps by interplanetary interactions. \n\n"}

However, by accurately measuring the environment in real time, the\nquantum system can be maintained in a pure state and its time evolution\ndescribed by a quantum trajectory conditioned on the measurement outcome. We\nemploy weak measurements to monitor a microwave cavity embedding a\nsuperconducting qubit and track the individual quantum trajectories of the\nsystem.

In this paper we assess different scenarios that may\nexplain the origin of these eccentric orbits, with particular focus on the\ninnermost body, noting that the large eccentricity of planet b cannot be\nexplained through secular interaction with the outer pair. We consider a\nscenario in which the system previously contained an additional giant planet\nthat was ejected during a period of dynamical instability among the planets.\nN-body simulations are presented that demonstrate that during scattering and\nejection among the outer planets a close encounter between a giant and the\ninner body can raise e_b to its observed value.

Gravitational perturbations from the companion are expected\nto excite high planetesimal eccentricities resulting in destruction, rather\nthan growth, of objects with sizes of up to several hundred km in collisions of\nsimilar-size bodies. It was recently suggested that gravity of a massive\naxisymmetric gaseous disk in which planetesimals are embedded drives rapid\nprecession of their orbits, suppressing eccentricity excitation. However, disks\nin binaries are themselves expected to be eccentric, leading to additional\nplanetesimal excitation. Here we develop secular theory of eccentricity\nevolution for planetesimals perturbed by the gravity of an elliptical\nprotoplanetary disk (neglecting gas drag) and the companion. For the first time\nwe derive an expression for the disturbing function due to an eccentric disk,\nwhich can be used for a variety of other astrophysical problems. We obtain\nexplicit analytical solutions for planetesimal eccentricity evolution and\ndelineate four different regimes of dynamical excitation.

As a result, the latter imposes a lower\nlimit on collisional velocities of solids, making their growth problematic.\nThis fragmentation barrier can be removed if the gaseous disk rapidly precesses\nor if its own self-gravity is efficient at lowering disk eccentricity. \n\n"}

Our model\nis constructed as the combination of planet traps with the standard core\naccretion scenario in which the efficiency of forming planetary cores directly\nrelates to the dust density in disks or the metallicity ([Fe/H]). We\nstatistically compute planet formation frequencies (PFFs) as well as the\norbital radius ($<R_{rapid}>$) within which gas accretion becomes efficient\nenough to form Jovian planets. The three characteristic exoplanetary\npopulations are considered: hot Jupiters, exo-Jupiters densely populated around\n1 AU, and low-mass planets such as super-Earths. We explore the behavior of the\nPFFs as well as $<R_{rapid}>$ for the three different populations as a function\nof metallicity ($-2 \\leq$[Fe/H]$\\leq -0.6$). We show that the total PFFs\nincrease steadily with metallicity, which is the direct outcome of the core\naccretion picture. For the entire range of the metallicity considered here, the\npopulation of the low-mass planets dominates over the Jovian planets. The\nJovian planets contribute to the PFFs above [Fe/H]-1. We find that the hot\nJupiters form at lower metallcities than the exo-Jupiters. This arises from the\nradially inward transport of planetary cores by their host traps, which is more\neffective for lower metallicity disks due to the slower growth of the cores.\nThe PFFs for the exo-Jupiters exceed those for the hot Jupiters around\n[Fe/H]-0.7. Finally, we show that the critical metallicity for forming Jovian\nplanets is [Fe/H]-1.2, which is evaluated by comparing the values of\n$<R_{rapid}>$ between the hot Jupiters and the low-mass planets.

To clarify their origin one has to understand the dynamics of\nplanetesimals in protoplanetary disks within binaries. The standard\ndescription, accounting for only gas drag and gravity of the companion star has\nbeen challenged recently, as the gravity of the protoplanetary disk was shown\nto play a crucial role in planetesimal dynamics. An added complication is the\ntendency of protoplanetary disks in binaries to become eccentric, giving rise\nto additional excitation of planetesimal eccentricity. Here, for the first\ntime, we analytically explore secular dynamics of planetesimals in binaries\nsuch as $\\alpha$ Cen and $\\gamma$ Cep under the combined action of (1) gravity\nof the eccentric protoplanetary disk, (2) perturbations due to the (coplanar)\neccentric companion, and (3) gas drag.

We present simulations of this process using a modified\nN-body code, starting from a swarm of planetary embryos.

A future fault-tolerant quantum computer\nwill use quantum error correction (QEC) to actively protect against both. In\nthe smallest QEC codes, the information in one logical qubit is encoded in a\ntwo-dimensional subspace of a larger Hilbert space of multiple physical qubits.\nFor each code, a set of non-demolition multi-qubit measurements, termed\nstabilizers, can discretize and signal physical qubit errors without collapsing\nthe encoded information. Experimental demonstrations of QEC to date, using\nnuclear magnetic resonance, trapped ions, photons, superconducting qubits, and\nNV centers in diamond, have circumvented stabilizers at the cost of decoding at\nthe end of a QEC cycle. This decoding leaves the quantum information vulnerable\nto physical qubit errors until re-encoding, violating a basic requirement for\nfault tolerance. Using a five-qubit superconducting processor, we realize the\ntwo parity measurements comprising the stabilizers of the three-qubit\nrepetition code protecting one logical qubit from physical bit-flip errors. We\nconstruct these stabilizers as parallelized indirect measurements using\nancillary qubits, and evidence their non-demolition character by generating\nthree-qubit entanglement from superposition states. We demonstrate\nstabilizer-based quantum error detection (QED) by subjecting a logical qubit to\ncoherent and incoherent bit-flip errors on its constituent physical qubits.\nWhile increased physical qubit coherence times and shorter QED blocks are\nrequired to actively safeguard quantum information, this demonstration is a\ncritical step toward larger codes based on multiple parity measurements. \n\n"}

However, most studies of tidal downsizing end\nwhen the protostellar disc disperses, while the system is embedded in its\nparent star-forming region. To compare disc fragment descendants with exoplanet\nand brown dwarf observations, the subsequent dynamical evolution must be\nexplored.\n  We carry out N-Body integrations of fragment-fragment scattering in\nmulti-object star systems, and star systems embedded in substructured clusters.\nIn both cases, we use initial conditions generated by population synthesis\nmodels of tidal downsizing.\n  The scattering simulations produce a wide range of eccentricities.

One way to access\nthis potential is to apply a strong optical trap to a minimally supported\nmechanical element, thereby increasing its quality factor $Q_m$. Current\nschemes, however, require prohibitively high laser power ($\\sim10$ W), and the\n$Q_m$ enhancement is ultimately limited to a factor of $\\sim$ 50 by\nhybridization between the trapped mode and the dissipative modes of the\nsupporting structure.

Applying this scheme to the case of a dielectric disk in a\nFabry-Perot cavity, we find a tilt-based tuning mechanism for optimizing both\ncenter-of-mass and torsional mode traps.

The time-varying abundance of small grains in an\nevolving disk directly affects gas heating by far-ultraviolet photons, while\ndust evolution affects photoevaporation by changing the disk opacity and\nresulting penetration of FUV photons in the disk. Photoevaporative flows, in\nturn, selectively carry small dust grains leaving the larger particles---which\ndecouple from the gas---behind in the disk. We study these effects by\ninvestigating the evolution of a disk subject to viscosity, photoevaporation by\nEUV, FUV and X-rays, dust evolution, and radial drift using a 1-D multi-fluid\napproach (gas + different dust grain sizes) to solve for the evolving surface\ndensity distributions. The 1-D evolution is augmented by 1+1D models\nconstructed at each epoch to obtain the instantaneous disk structure and\ndetermine photoevaporation rates. The implementation of a dust\ncoagulation/fragmentation model results in a marginal decrease in disk\nlifetimes when compared to models with no dust evolution; the disk lifetime is\nthus found to be relatively insensitive to the evolving dust opacity.

Here, we use\n$N$-body simulations to characterise close star-planet and planet-planet\nencounters and the dynamical fate of the FFP population in star clusters\ncontaining $500-2000$ single or binary star members. We find that FFPs ejected\nfrom their planetary system at low velocities typically leave the star cluster\n40% earlier than their host stars, and experience tens of close ($<1000$ AU)\nencounters with other stars and planets before they escape. The fraction of\nFFPs that experiences a close encounter depends on both the stellar density and\nthe initial velocity distribution of the FFPs. Approximately half of the close\nencounters occur within the first 30 Myr, and only 10% occur after 100 Myr.

Estimating the rate of false positives of the overall\nKepler sample is necessary to derive the planet occurrence rate. We present the\nresults from two large observational campaigns that were conducted with the\nSpitzer telescope during the the Kepler mission.

We use these observations to measures the\ncandidate's transit depths and infrared magnitudes. A bandpass-dependent depth\nalerts us to the potential presence of a blending star that could be the source\nof the observed eclipse: a false-positive scenario. For most of the candidates\n(85%), the transit depths measured with Kepler are consistent with the depths\nmeasured with Spitzer as expected for planetary objects, while we find that the\nmost discrepant measurements are due to the presence of unresolved stars that\ndilute the photometry.

In particular, the hypothesis of a helium-dominated\natmosphere can explain the thermal emission spectrum of GJ 436 b, a warm\nNeptune-sized exoplanet, while also consistent with the transmission spectrum.\nThis model atmosphere contains trace amounts of hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen,\nwith the predominance of CO over CH4 as the main form of carbon. With our\natmospheric evolution model, we find that if the mass of the initial atmosphere\nenvelope is 1E-3 planetary mass, hydrodynamic escape can reduce the hydrogen\nabundance in the atmosphere by several orders of magnitude in ~10 billion\nyears. Observations of exoplanet transits may thus detect signatures of helium\natmospheres and probe the evolutionary history of small exoplanets. \n\n"}

After proving the representation formula we carefully analyze the\nintegral representation to obtain the quantitative decay rates of (ii).\n  Next we use Fourier analysis techniques to obtain the optimal decay rate for\nmild solutions. Here we encounter the critical dimension phenomenon where the\ndecay rate attains the decay rate of that in a bounded domain for large enough\ndimensions. Consequently, the decay rate does not anymore improve when the\ndimension increases. The theory is markedly different from that of the standard\ncaloric functions and this substantially complicates the analysis.\n  Finally, we use energy estimates and a comparison principle to prove a\nquantitative decay rate for weak solutions defined via a variational\nformulation.

Its location is determined by the properties of the star, the mass\naccretion rate through the disk, and the size distribution of dust suspended in\nthe disk. We calculate the snow line location from recent observations of mass\naccretion rates and as a function of stellar mass. By taking the observed\ndispersion in mass accretion rates as a measure of the dispersion in initial\ndisk mass, we find that stars of a given mass will exhibit a range of snow line\nlocations. At a given age and stellar mass, the observed dispersion in mass\naccretion rates of 0.4 dex naturally leads to a dispersion in snow line\nlocations of 0.2 dex. For ISM-like dust sizes, the one-sigma snow line location\namong solar mass stars of the same age ranges from 2 to 5 au. For more\nrealistic dust opacities that include larger grains, the snow line is located\nup to two times closer to the star. We use these locations and the outcome of\nN-body simulations to predict the amount of water delivered to terrestrial\nplanets that formed in situ in the habitable zone. We find that the dispersion\nin snow line locations leads to a large range in water content. For ISM-like\ndust sizes, a significant fraction of habitable-zone terrestrial planets around\nsun-like stars remain dry, and no water is delivered to the habitable zones of\nlow-mass M stars (less than half a solar mass) as in previous works. The\ncloser-in snow line in disks with larger grains enables water delivery to the\nhabitable zone for a significant fraction of M stars and all FGK stars.\nConsidering their larger numbers and higher planet occurrence, M stars may host\nmost of the water-rich terrestrial planets in the galaxy if these planets are\nable to hold on to their water in their subsequent evolution. \n\n"}

In a mass-radius diagram, the two lines\nintersect near the Planck point $(l_P,m_P)$, where quantum gravity effects\nbecome significant. Since canonical (non-gravitational) quantum mechanics is\nbased on the concept of wave-particle duality, encapsulated in the de Broglie\nrelations, these relations should break down near $(l_P,m_P)$.

For the former, the\nmeasured gap widths are used for calibrating the mass of the bodies, while for\nthe latter, the measured gap depths are utilized.

The\npresence of a DZ naturally leads to conditions susceptible to the Rossby wave\ninstability (RWI), which produces vortices and spiral density waves that may\nrevive the DZ and be responsible for observed large-scale disc structures. We\npresent a series of two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the\nrole of the RWI in DZs, including its impact on the long-term evolution of the\ndisc and its morphology. The nonlinear RWI can generate Reynolds stresses\n(effective $\\alpha$ parameter) as large as $0.01 - 0.05$ in the DZ, helping to\nsustain quasi-steady accretion throughout the disc. It also produces novel disc\nmorphologies, including azimuthal asymmetries with $m = 1, 2$, and atypical\nvortex shapes. The angular momentum transport strength and morphology are most\nsensitive to two parameters: the radial extent of the DZ and the disc\nviscosity. The largest Reynolds stresses are produced when the radial extent of\nthe DZ is less than its distance to the central star. Such narrow DZs lead to a\nsingle vortex or two coherent antipodal vortices in the quasi-steady state. The\nedges of wider DZs evolve separately, resulting in two independent vortices and\nreduced angular momentum transport efficiency.

Such measurements are used in internal\nstructure models to constrain interior compositions of super-Earths. It is now\ncritically important to quantify the effect of various model assumptions on the\npredicted radii. In particular, models often neglect thermal effects, a choice\njustified by noting that the thermal expansion of a solid Earth-like planet is\nsmall. However, the thermal effects for water-rich interiors may be\nsignificant. We have systematically explored the extent to which thermal\neffects can influence the radii of water-rich super-Earths over a wide range of\nmasses, surface temperatures, surface pressures and water mass fractions. We\ndeveloped temperature-dependent internal structure models of water-rich\nsuper-Earths that include a comprehensive temperature-dependent water equation\nof state. We found that thermal effects induce significant changes in their\nradii. For example, for super-Earths with 10 per cent water by mass, the radius\nincreases by up to 0.5$\\,$R$_\\oplus$ when the surface temperature is increased\nfrom 300 to 1000$\\,$K, assuming a surface pressure of 100$\\,$bar and an\nadiabatic temperature gradient in the water layer.

Among the data processing techniques for angular differential imaging\n(ADI), the most recent is the family of principal component analysis (PCA)\nbased algorithms. PCA serves, in this case, as a subspace projection technique\nfor constructing a reference point spread function (PSF) that can be subtracted\nfrom the science data for boosting the detectability of potential companions\npresent in the data. Unfortunately, when building this reference PSF from the\nscience data itself, PCA comes with certain limitations such as the sensitivity\nof the lower dimensional orthogonal subspace to non-Gaussian noise.

However, a critical challenge\nfacing the development of these systems is to achieve strong coupling between\nmechanics and qubits while simultaneously reducing coupling of both the qubit\nand mechanical mode to the environment. Here we report measurements of a\nqubit-coupled mechanical resonator system consisting of an ultra-high-frequency\nnanoresonator and a long coherence-time superconducting transmon qubit,\nembedded in superconducting coplanar waveguide cavity. It is demonstrated that\nthe nanoresonator and transmon have commensurate energies and transmon\ncoherence times are one order of magnitude larger than for all previously\nreported qubit-coupled nanoresonators. Moreover, we show that numerical\nsimulations of this new hybrid quantum system are in good agreement with\nspectroscopic measurements and suggest that the nanoresonator in our device\nresides at low thermal occupation number, near its ground state, acting as a\ndissipative bath seen by the qubit. We also outline how this system could soon\nbe developed as a platform for implementing more advanced experiments with\ndirect relevance to quantum information processing and quantum thermodynamics,\nincluding the study of nanoresonator quantum noise properties, reservoir\nengineering, and nanomechanical quantum state generation and detection. \n\n"}

Previous studies have analyzed\nwhether populations have the capacity to keep up with shifting temperature\nisoclines, and have mathematically determined the combination of growth and\ndispersal that is needed to achieve this. However, the rate of isocline\nmovement can be highly variable, with much uncertainty associated with yearly\nshifts. The same is true for population growth rates. Growth rates can be\nvariable and uncertain, even within suitable habitats for growth. In this paper\nwe reanalyze the question of population persistence in the context of the\nuncertainty and variability in isocline shifts and rates of growth.\nSpecifically, we employ a stochastic integrodifference equation model on a\npatch of suitable habitat that shifts poleward at a random rate. We derive a\nmetric describing the asymptotic growth rate of the linearized operator of the\nstochastic model and yielding a threshold criterion for population persistence.\nWe demonstrate that the variability in the yearly shift and in the growth rate\nhas a significant negative effect on the persistence in the sense that it\ndecreases the threshold criterion for population persistence.

Analysis of dynamics for the case where the\ndispersal kernel is Gaussian leads to the existence of a critical shifting\nspeed.

We\nshow, first, that a pair of detuned two-level systems (2LS) separated by a half\nwavelength mimic a driven {\\Lambda}-type three-level system (3LS) in both the\nsingle- and two- photon sectors.

Pebble accretion has been\ndemonstrated to play an important role in core accretion and to have growth\nrates that are consistent with planetary migration. The high pebble accretion\nrates allow planetary cores to start their growth beyond 10 AU and subsequently\nmigrate to cold (>~ 1 AU), warm (~0.1 AU- 1AU) or hot (<~ 0.1 AU) orbits. In\nthis work we investigate how the formation of giant planets via pebble\naccretion influences their atmospheric chemical compositions. We find that\nunder the standard pebble accretion scenario, where the core is isolated from\nthe envelope, the resulting metallicities (O/H and C/H ratios) are sub-solar,\nwhile the C/O ratios are super-solar. Planets that migrate through the disk to\nbecome hot Jupiters accrete substantial amounts of water vapour, but still\nacquire slightly sub-solar O/H and super-solar C/O of 0.7-0.8.

Abstract: Photometry of short-period planetary systems allows astronomers to monitor\nexoplanets, their host stars, and their mutual interactions. In addition to the\ntransits of a planet in front of its star and the eclipses of the planet by its\nstar, researchers have reported flux variations at the orbital frequency and\nits harmonics: planetary reflection and/or emission and Doppler beaming of\nstarlight produce one peak per orbit, while ellipsoidal variations of a tidally\ndistorted star and/or planet produce two maxima per orbit. Researchers have\nalso reported significant photometric variability at three times the orbital\nfrequency, sometimes much greater than the predictions of tidal theory. The\nreflected phase variations of a homogeneous planet contains power at even\norbital harmonics-important for studies of ellipsoidal variations-but cannot\ncontain odd orbital harmonics. We show that odd harmonics can, however, be\nproduced by an edge-on planet with a time-variable map, or an inclined planet\nwith a North-South (N-S) asymmetric map. Either of these scenarios entail\nweather: short-period planets are expected to have zero obliquity and hence N-S\nsymmetric stellar forcing. North-South asymmetry in a giant planet would\ntherefore suggest stochastic localized features, such as weather. However, we\nfind that previous claims of large-amplitude odd modes in Kepler photometry are\nartifacts of removing planetary transits rather than modeling them. The only\nreliable claims of odd harmonics remain HAT-P-7b and Kepler-13Ab, for which the\nthird mode amplitude is 6-8% of the planetary flux. Although time-variable\nalbedo maps could in principle explain these odd harmonics, upper-limits on the\ninfrared variability of hot Jupiters make this hypothesis unlikely. We urge\ntheorists to study the effects of close-in planets on stellar atmospheres, as\nthis remains the only plausible hypothesis. \n\n"}

The targets are selected to probe the obliquity against\na wide range of stellar and planetary physical parameters. We exploit\nhigh-precision radial velocity (RV) measurements, delivered by the HARPS-N\nspectrograph at the 3.6m Telescopio Nazionale Galileo, to measure the\nRossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect in RV time-series bracketing planet transits,\nand to refine the orbital parameters determinations with out-of-transit RV\ndata. We also analyse new transit light curves obtained with several 1-2m class\ntelescopes to better constrain the physical fundamental parameters of the\nplanets and parent stars. We report here on new transit spectroscopic\nobservations for three very massive close-in giant planets: WASP43b, HATP20b\nand Qatar2b orbiting dwarf K-type stars with effective temperature well below\n5000K.

Additionally, we examine the potential effects of gravitational\ndarkening (GD), revealing that it could significantly amplify disc-integrated\npolarization.

To arrive at\nthis result, we derive the leading corrections to the lumped-element Josephson\nparametric amplifier of three common pumping schemes: monochromatic current\npump, bichromatic current pump, and monochromatic flux pump. We show that the\nleading correction for the last two schemes is a single Kerr-type quartic term,\nwhile the first scheme contains additional cubic terms. In all cases, we find\nthat the corrections are detrimental to squeezing. In addition, we show that\nthe Kerr correction leads to a strongly phase-dependent reduction of the\nquantum efficiency of a phase-sensitive measurement. Finally, we quantify the\ndeparture from ideal Gaussian character of the filtered output field from\nnumerical calculation of third and fourth order cumulants. Our results show\nthat, while a Gaussian output field is expected for an ideal Josephson\nparametric amplifier, higher-order corrections lead to non-Gaussian effects\nwhich increase with both gain and nonlinearity strength.

Its relatively high density in combination with the high radar\nalbedo, led to classify the asteroid as a metallic object, possibly a core of a\ndifferentiated body, remnant of \"hit-and-run\" collisions. The detection of\nhydration is, in principle, inconsistent with a pure metallic origin of this\nbody. Here we consider the scenario that the hydration on its surface is\nexogenous and was delivered by hydrated impactors. We show that impacting\nasteroids that belong to families whose members have the 3 m band can deliver\nthe hydrated material to Psyche.

We measure the flux of the four\nstellar emission features detected in the COS spectrum (CII, CIII, CIV, SiIV).\nComparing the CII/CIV flux ratio measured for WASP-18 with that derived from\nspectra of nearby stars with known age, we see that the far-UV spectrum of\nWASP-18 resembles that of old ($>$5 Gyr), inactive stars, in stark contrast\nwith its young age.

The emergent polarization is sensitive to aspects of the\nplanet atmosphere such as the gas composition and the occurrence of condensates\nand their optical properties. Extracting this information will represent a\nmajor step in the characterization of exoplanets. The numerical simulations\npresented here show that the polarization of a spatially-unresolved exoplanet\nmay be detected by cross-correlating high-dispersion linear polarization and\nintensity (brightness) spectra of the planet-star system. The Doppler shift of\nthe planet-reflected starlight facilitates the separation of this signal from\nthe polarization introduced by the interstellar medium and the terrestrial\natmosphere.

The spectral trends in the morphology\nof Clump1 are quantitatively consistent with the Lyra-Lin prescriptions for\ndust trapping in an anticyclonic vortex, provided with porous grains\n(f~0.2+-0.2) in a very elongated (Chi~14+-3) and cold (T~23+-2K) vortex. The\nsame prescriptions constrain the turbulence parameter alpha and the gas surface\ndensity Sigma_g through log10( alpha x Sigma_g /g/cm2)~-2.3+-0.4, thus\nrequiring values for Sigma_g larger than a factor of a few compared to that\nreported in the literature from the CO isotopologues, if alpha <~ 1E-3. Such\nphysical conditions imply an appreciably optically thick continuum even at\ncm-wavelengths (tau(33GHz)~0.2). A secondary and shallower peak at 342GHz is\nabout twice fainter relative to Clump1 at 33GHz. Clump2 appears to be less\nefficient at trapping large grains. \n\n"}

A recent study proposed to estimate the\nuncertainties using a Bayesian approach (Schmidt et al., Icarus 2015). In the\npresent article, we first propose an improved numerical implementation to speed\nup the uncertainties estimation. Then, we conduct two synthetic studies about\nphotometric measurements in order to analyze the influence of observation\ngeometry:\n  First, we introduce the concept of \"efficiency\" of a set of geometries to\nsample the photometric behavior. A set of angular sampling elements (noted as\ngeometry) is efficient if the retrieved Hapke parameters are close to the\nexpected ones. We compared different geometries and found that the principal\nplane with high incidence is the most efficient geometry among the tested ones.\nIn particular, such geometries are better than poorly sampled full BRDF.\n  Second, we test the analysis scheme of a collection of photometric data\nacquired from various locations in order to answer the question: are these\nlocations photometrically homogeneous or not? For instance, this question\narises when combining data from an entire planetary body, where each spatial\nposition is sampled at a single geometry.

The dwarf planet Ceres and the asteroid Vesta have been studied by\nthe Dawn space mission. They are the two heaviest bodies of the main asteroid\nbelt and have different characteristics. Notably, Vesta appears to be dry and\ninactive with two large basins at its south pole. Ceres is an ice-rich body\nwith signs of cryovolcanic activity.\n  Aims. The aim of this paper is to determine the obliquity variations of Ceres\nand Vesta and to study their rotational stability.\n  Methods. The orbital and rotational motions have been integrated by\nsymplectic integration. The rotational stability has been studied by\nintegrating secular equations and by computing the diffusion of the precession\nfrequency.\n  Results. The obliquity variations of Ceres over $[-20:0]\\,\\mathrm{Myr}$ are\nbetween $2$ and $20{\\deg}$ and the obliquity variations of Vesta are between\n$21$ and $45{\\deg}$. The two giant impacts suffered by Vesta modified the\nprecession constant and could have put Vesta closer to the resonance with the\norbital frequency $2s_6-s_V$. Given the uncertainty on the polar moment of\ninertia, the present Vesta could be in this resonance where the obliquity\nvariations can vary between $17$ and $48{\\deg}$.\n  Conclusions. Although Ceres and Vesta have precession frequencies close to\nthe secular orbital frequencies of the inner planets, their long-term rotations\nare relatively stable. The perturbations of Jupiter and Saturn dominate the\nsecular orbital dynamics of Ceres and Vesta and the perturbations of the inner\nplanets are much weaker. The secular resonances with the inner planets also\nhave smaller widths and do not overlap, contrary to the case of the inner\nplanets. \n\n"}

These scalars acquire non-zero expectation values during inflation\nthrough linear couplings to a function of an inflaton. After the inflaton\ndecay, the model possesses approximate U(1)-invariance, explicitly broken by a\nsmall mass splitting. This splitting leads to the baryogenesis in the early\nUniverse. Resulting baryon asymmetry is automatically small for the scalars\nwith the masses about the Grand Unification scale and larger. It is fully\ndetermined by the inflaton dynamics and the Lagrangian parameters, i.e., is\nindependent of initial pre-inflationary conditions for the scalars. As a\nconsequence, baryon perturbations are purely adiabatic.

A\nlarge span of migration rates were explored for Titan and Iapetus was started\non its local Laplace plane with a circular orbit. The resonance crossing can\ntrigger a chaotic evolution of the eccentricity and the inclination of Iapetus.\nThe outcome of the resonance is highly dependent on the migration rate. For a\nquality factor Q of over around 2000, the chaotic evolution of Iapetus in the\nresonance leads in most cases to its ejection, while simulations with a quality\nfactor between 100 and 2000 show a departure from the resonance with\npost-resonant eccentricities spanning from 0 up to 15%, and free inclinations\ncapable of reaching 11 degrees.

In dense magnetized molecular clouds where C-shocks are\npresent, PAHs and nanoparticles are widely believed to originate from grain\nshattering due to grain-grain collisions. The remaining question is whether\nthese nanoparticles can survive in the dense and hot shocked regions, and how\nto constrain their size and abundance with observations. In this paper, we\npresent a new mechanism to destroy nanoparticles in C-shocks based on\ncentrifugal stress within rapidly spinning nanoparticles spun-up by stochastic\natomic bombardment, which is termed rotational disruption. We find that, due to\nsupersonic neutral gas-charged grain drift in C-shocks, nanoparticles can be\nspun-up to suprathermal rotation by stochastic torques exerted by supersonic\nneutral flow. The resulting centrifugal stress within suprathermally rotating\nnanoparticles can exceed the maximum tensile strength of grain material\n($S_{\\max}$), resulting in rapid disruption of nanoparticles smaller than\n$a\\sim 1$ nm for $S_{\\max}\\sim 10^{9}\\erg\\cm^{-3}$.

For the rest of the paper, we focus on the study of\nfinite-time radial blow-up solutions, and prove a result on the concentration\nof the $L^3$ norm at the origin. Two disparate possibilities emerge, one which\ncoincides with solutions typically observed in numerical experiments that\nconsist of a specific bump profile with maximum at the origin and focus toward\nthe origin at rate $\\sim(T-t)^{1/2}$, where $T>0$ is the blow-up time.
