However in many practical situations of interest, models are\nconstrained structurally so that they only have a few degrees of freedom\nrelative to their ambient dimension. This paper provides a general framework to\nconvert notions of simplicity into convex penalty functions, resulting in\nconvex optimization solutions to linear, underdetermined inverse problems. The\nclass of simple models considered are those formed as the sum of a few atoms\nfrom some (possibly infinite) elementary atomic set; examples include\nwell-studied cases such as sparse vectors and low-rank matrices, as well as\nseveral others including sums of a few permutations matrices, low-rank tensors,\northogonal matrices, and atomic measures.

The facial structure of the atomic norm\nball carries a number of favorable properties that are useful for recovering\nsimple models, and an analysis of the underlying convex geometry provides sharp\nestimates of the number of generic measurements required for exact and robust\nrecovery of models from partial information.

As a consequence, the\nsolutions of Kolmogorov PDEs are smooth at all positive times if the\ncoefficients of the PDE are smooth and satisfy H\\\"{o}rmander's condition even\nif the initial function is only continuous but not differentiable. First-order\nlinear Kolmogorov PDEs with smooth coefficients do not have this smoothing\neffect but at least preserve regularity in the sense that solutions are smooth\nif their initial functions are smooth. In this article, we consider the\nintermediate regime of nonhypoelliptic second-order Kolmogorov PDEs with smooth\ncoefficients. The main observation of this article is that there exist\ncounterexamples to regularity preservation in that case. More precisely, we\ngive an example of a second-order linear Kolmogorov PDE with globally bounded\nand smooth coefficients and a smooth initial function with compact support such\nthat the unique globally bounded viscosity solution of the PDE is not even\nlocally H\\\"{o}lder continuous. From the perspective of probability theory, the\nexistence of this example PDE has the consequence that there exists a\nstochastic differential equation (SDE) with globally bounded and smooth\ncoefficients and a smooth function with compact support which is mapped by the\ncorresponding transition semigroup to a function which is not locally\nH\\\"{o}lder continuous. In other words, degenerate noise can have a roughening\neffect. A further implication of this loss of regularity phenomenon is that\nnumerical approximations may converge without any arbitrarily small polynomial\nrate of convergence to the true solution of the SDE. More precisely, we prove\nfor an example SDE with globally bounded and smooth coefficients that the\nstandard Euler approximations converge to the exact solution of the SDE in the\nstrong and numerically weak sense, but at a rate that is slower then any power\nlaw. \n\n"}

This paper concerns solving this kind of optimization problem in a\ndistributed manner while protecting the privacy of user information. Without\nprivacy considerations, existing distributed algorithms normally consist in a\ncentral entity computing and broadcasting certain public coordination signals\nto participating users. However, the coordination signals often depend on user\ninformation, so that an adversary who has access to the coordination signals\ncan potentially decode information on individual users and put user privacy at\nrisk. We present a distributed optimization algorithm that preserves\ndifferential privacy, which is a strong notion that guarantees user privacy\nregardless of any auxiliary information an adversary may have. The algorithm\nachieves privacy by perturbing the public signals with additive noise, whose\nmagnitude is determined by the sensitivity of the projection operation onto\nuser-specified constraints.

In the present paper, we consider the mean-field\nlimit of that model, called the kinetic Cucker-Smale model, which is a\ntransport partial differential equation involving nonlocal terms. It is known\nthat flocking is reached asymptotically whenever the initial conditions of the\ngroup of agents are in a favorable configuration. For other initial\nconfigurations, it is natural to investigate whether flocking can be enforced\nby means of an appropriate external force, applied to an adequate time-varying\nsubdomain.\n  In this paper we prove that we can drive to flocking any group of agents\ngoverned by the kinetic Cucker-Smale model, by means of a sparse centralized\ncontrol strategy, and this, for any initial configuration of the crowd. Here,\n\"sparse control\" means that the action at each time is limited over an\narbitrary proportion of the crowd, or, as a variant, of the space of\nconfigurations; \"centralized\" means that the strategy is computed by an\nexternal agent knowing the configuration of all agents.

The sparsity\nconstraint reflects the fact that one cannot act on the whole crowd at every\ninstant of time.\n  Our approach is based on geometric considerations on the velocity field of\nthe kinetic Cucker-Smale PDE, and in particular on the analysis of the particle\nflow generated by this vector field. The control domain and the control\nfunctions are designed to satisfy appropriate constraints, and such that, for\nany initial configuration, the velocity part of the support of the measure\nsolution asymptotically shrinks to a singleton, which means flocking. \n\n"}

The main contributions of this study are the\nextension of Crawford and Sobel's cheap talk formulation to multi-dimensional\nsources and to noisy channel setups. We consider both (simultaneous) Nash\nequilibria and (sequential) Stackelberg equilibria. We show that for arbitrary\nscalar sources, in the presence of misalignment, the quantized nature of all\nequilibrium policies holds for Nash equilibria in the sense that all Nash\nequilibria are equivalent to those achieved by quantized encoder policies. On\nthe other hand, all Stackelberg equilibria policies are fully informative. For\nmulti-dimensional setups, unlike the scalar case, Nash equilibrium policies may\nbe of non-quantized nature, and even linear.

To make such\nan algorithm practical, X should be proximal-friendly -- admit a strongly\nconvex function with easy to minimize linear perturbations. As a byproduct, X\nadmits a computationally cheap Linear Minimization Oracle (LMO) capable to\nminimize over X linear forms. There are, however, important situations where a\ncheap LMO indeed is available, but X is not proximal-friendly, which motivates\nsearch for algorithms based solely on LMO's.

In particular, it provides\nnatural options for interpolation of distributions (displacement interpolation)\nand for modeling flows.

In spite of extensive work and theoretical\ndevelopments, the computation of OMT for large scale problems has remained a\nchallenging task. An alternative framework for interpolating distributions,\nrooted in statistical mechanics and large deviations, is that of Schroedinger\nbridges (entropic interpolation).

However, naive gradient methods generally converge\nslowly. Hence, much efforts have been made to accelerate various first-order\nmethods. This paper proposes two accelerated methods towards solving structured\nlinearly constrained convex programming, for which we assume composite convex\nobjective.\n  The first method is the accelerated linearized augmented Lagrangian method\n(LALM). At each update to the primal variable, it allows linearization to the\ndifferentiable function and also the augmented term, and thus it enables easy\nsubproblems. Assuming merely weak convexity, we show that LALM owns $O(1/t)$\nconvergence if parameters are kept fixed during all the iterations and can be\naccelerated to $O(1/t^2)$ if the parameters are adapted, where $t$ is the\nnumber of total iterations.\n  The second method is the accelerated linearized alternating direction method\nof multipliers (LADMM). In addition to the composite convexity, it further\nassumes two-block structure on the objective. Different from classic ADMM, our\nmethod allows linearization to the objective and also augmented term to make\nthe update simple.

Abstract: Several probabilistic models from high-dimensional statistics and machine\nlearning reveal an intriguing --and yet poorly understood-- dichotomy. Either\nsimple local algorithms succeed in estimating the object of interest, or even\nsophisticated semi-definite programming (SDP) relaxations fail.\n  In order to explore this phenomenon, we study a classical SDP relaxation of\nthe minimum graph bisection problem, when applied to Erd\\H{o}s-Renyi random\ngraphs with bounded average degree $d>1$, and obtain several types of results.\nFirst, we use a dual witness construction (using the so-called non-backtracking\nmatrix of the graph) to upper bound the SDP value. Second, we prove that a\nsimple local algorithm approximately solves the SDP to within a factor\n$2d^2/(2d^2+d-1)$ of the upper bound. In particular, the local algorithm is at\nmost $8/9$ suboptimal, and $1+O(1/d)$ suboptimal for large degree.\n  We then analyze a more sophisticated local algorithm, which aggregates\ninformation according to the harmonic measure on the limiting Galton-Watson\n(GW) tree. The resulting lower bound is expressed in terms of the conductance\nof the GW tree and matches surprisingly well the empirically determined SDP\nvalues on large-scale Erd\\H{o}s-Renyi graphs.\n  We finally consider the planted partition model. In this case, purely local\nalgorithms are known to fail, but they do succeed if a small amount of side\ninformation is available. Our results imply quantitative bounds on the\nthreshold for partial recovery using SDP in this model. \n\n"}

RSBT treatment planning has more degrees\nof freedom than conventional high-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT) due to the\naddition of emission direction, and this necessitates a fast optimization\ntechnique to enable clinical usage. // Methods: The multi-helix RSBT (H-RSBT)\ndelivery technique was considered with five representative cervical cancer\npatients.

The rectum, bladder,\nsigmoid, high-risk clinical target volume (HR-CTV), and HR-CTV boundary were\nthe structures considered in our optimization problem, called the asymmetric\ndose-volume optimization with smoothness control. Dose calculation resolution\nwas 1x1x3 mm^3 for all cases. The H-RSBT applicator has 6 helices, with 33.3 mm\nof translation along the applicator per helical rotation and 1.7 mm spacing\nbetween dwell positions, yielding 17.5 degree emission angle spacing per 5 mm\nalong the applicator.// Results: For each patient, HR-CTV D90, HR-CTV D100,\nrectum D2cc, sigmoid D2cc, and bladder D2cc matched within 1% for CPLEX and\nPOGS.

Historically, research has focused on situations where the number of\noscillators, $n$, is extremely large and can be treated as being infinite.

The overall algorithm is conceptually\nsimple, numerically scalable, and easy-to-implement. For certain random\nmeasurement models, the novel procedure is shown capable of finding the true\nsolution $x$ in time proportional to reading the data $\\{(a_i;y_i)\\}_{1\\le i\n\\le m}$. This holds with high probability and without extra assumption on the\nsignal $x$ to be recovered, provided that the number $m$ of equations is some\nconstant $c>0$ times the number $n$ of unknowns in the signal vector, namely,\n$m>cn$. Empirically, the upshots of this contribution are: i) (almost) $100\\%$\nperfect signal recovery in the high-dimensional (say e.g., $n\\ge 2,000$) regime\ngiven only an information-theoretic limit number of noiseless equations,\nnamely, $m=2n-1$ in the real-valued Gaussian case; and, ii) (nearly) optimal\nstatistical accuracy in the presence of additive noise of bounded support.\nFinally, substantial numerical tests using both synthetic data and real images\ncorroborate markedly improved signal recovery performance and computational\nefficiency of our novel procedure relative to state-of-the-art approaches. \n\n"}

Simulations on New York City\n(NYC) taxi trip data show that our heuristics are up to 90% optimal and 10^5\ntimes faster than the (necessarily) exponential-time optimal algorithm.\n  Commercial ridesharing service providers generate significant savings by\nmatching multiple ride requests using heuristic methods. The resulting savings\nare typically shared between the service provider (in the form of increased\nprofit) and the ridesharing passengers (in the form of discounts). It is not\nclear a priori how this split should be effected, since higher discounts would\nencourage more ridesharing, thereby increasing total savings, but the fraction\nof savings taken as profit is reduced. We simulate a scenario where the\ndecisions of the passengers to opt for ridesharing depend on the discount\noffered by the service provider. We provide an adaptive learning algorithm\nIDFLA that learns the optimal profit-maximizing discount factor for the\nprovider. An evaluation over NYC data shows that IDFLA, on average, learns the\noptimal discount factor in under 16 iterations.\n  Finally, we investigate the impact of imposing a detour-aware routing policy\nbased on sequential individual rationality, a recently proposed concept. Such\nrestricted policies offer a better ride experience, increasing the provider's\nmarket share, but at the cost of decreased average per-ride profit due to the\nreduced number of matched rides.

The method leverages optimal transport\ntheory, in the sense that our aim is to reconstruct histograms using so-called\ndisplacement interpolations (a.k.a. Wasserstein barycenters) between dictionary\natoms; such atoms are themselves synthetic histograms in the probability\nsimplex. Our method simultaneously estimates such atoms, and, for each\ndatapoint, the vector of weights that can optimally reconstruct it as an\noptimal transport barycenter of such atoms. Our method is computationally\ntractable thanks to the addition of an entropic regularization to the usual\noptimal transportation problem, leading to an approximation scheme that is\nefficient, parallel and simple to differentiate. Both atoms and weights are\nlearned using a gradient-based descent method. Gradients are obtained by\nautomatic differentiation of the generalized Sinkhorn iterations that yield\nbarycenters with entropic smoothing. Because of its formulation relying on\nWasserstein barycenters instead of the usual matrix product between dictionary\nand codes, our method allows for nonlinear relationships between atoms and the\nreconstruction of input data. We illustrate its application in several\ndifferent image processing settings. \n\n"}

Our purpose is to design a\nHeath-Jarrow-Morton framework for an additive, mean-reverting, multicommodity\nmarket consisting of forward contracts of any delivery period. The main\nassumption is that forward prices can be represented as affine functions of a\nuniversal source of randomness. This allows us to completely characterize the\nmodels which prevent arbitrage opportunities: this boils down to finding a\ndensity between a risk-neutral measure $\\mathbb{Q}$, such that the prices of\ntraded assets like forward contracts are true $\\mathbb{Q}$-martingales, and the\nreal world probability measure $\\mathbb{P}$, under which forward prices are\nmean-reverting.

Finally, several\nexamples are employed to illustrate our approach. \n\n"}

The fact that one of the subproblems to be\nsolved within the iteration process of AMA does not usually correspond to the\ncalculation of a proximal operator through a closed formula, affects the\nimplementability of the algorithm.

The approach presented\ndirectly addresses order batching, but uses a distance approximation to\ninfluence the batching of orders without directly addressing the routing\nproblem.\n  We present a basic formulation based on deciding the orders to be batched\ntogether so as to optimise an objective that approximates the picker routing\ndistance travelled. We extend our formulation by improving the approximation\nfor cases where we have more than one block in the warehouse. We present\nconstraints to remove symmetry in order to lessen the computational effort\nrequired, as well as constraints that significantly improve the value of the\nlinear programming relaxation of our formulation. A heuristic algorithm based\non partial integer optimisation of our mathematical formulation is also\npresented. Once order batching has been decided we optimally route each\nindividual picker using a previous approach presented in the literature.\n  Extensive computational results for publicly available test problems\ninvolving up to 75 orders are given for both single and multiple block\nwarehouse configurations. \n\n"}

Unfortunately, such topology knowledge is\noften unavailable due to limited investment, especially for \\revv{low-voltage}\ndistribution grids. Also, the bus phase labeling information is inaccurate due\nto human errors or outdated records. For this challenge, this paper utilizes\nsmart meter data for an information-theoretic approach to learn the topology of\ndistribution grids. Specifically, multi-phase unbalanced systems are converted\ninto symmetrical components, namely positive, negative, and zero sequences.\nThen, this paper proves that the Chow-Liu algorithm finds the topology by\nutilizing power flow equations and the conditional independence relationships\nimplied by the radial multi-phase structure of distribution grids with the\npresence of incorrect bus phase labels. At last, by utilizing Carson's\nequation, this paper proves that the bus phase connection can be correctly\nidentified using voltage measurements.

Our goal is to design a coding scheme such that the\neavesdropper cannot infer the plant's current state, while the user\nsuccessfully decodes the sent messages.

One popular way to address this issue is the Stochastic Dual\nDynamic Programming method (SDDP) introduced by Perreira and Pinto in 1991 for\nMarkov Decision Processes. Assuming that the value function is convex (for a\nminimization problem), one builds a non-decreasing sequence of lower (or outer)\nconvex approximations of the value function. Those convex approximations are\nconstructed as a supremum of affine cuts.
