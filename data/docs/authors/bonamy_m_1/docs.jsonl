We prove bounds $(\\delta(G)^2/24-o(1))n^2 < \\obf G <3 n^2$ for an\n$n$-vertex planar graph $G$ with minimum vertex degree $\\delta(G)\\ge 2$.\n  The shift complexity of $G$, denoted by $shift(G)$, is the minimum number of\nvertex shifts sufficient to eliminate all edge crossings in an arbitrarily\nobfuscated drawing of $G$ (after shifting a vertex, all incident edges are\nsupposed to be redrawn correspondingly).

Schwartz and\nVardy conjectured that the stopping redundancy of an MDS code should only\ndepend on its length and minimum distance.\n  We define the (n,t)-single-exclusion number, S(n,t) as the smallest number of\nt-subsets of an n-set, such that for each i-subset of the n-set, i=1,...,t+1,\nthere exists a t-subset that contains all but one element of the i-subset.

There\nthe main interest is to identify a small number of infected people among a\nlarge population using collective samples. In viral epidemics, one way to\nacquire collective samples is by sending agents inside the population. While in\nclassical group testing, it is assumed that the sampling procedure is fully\nknown to the reconstruction algorithm, in this work we assume that the decoder\npossesses only partial knowledge about the sampling process. This assumption is\njustified by observing the fact that in a viral sickness, there is a chance\nthat an agent remains healthy despite having contact with an infected person.\nTherefore, the reconstruction method has to cope with two different types of\nuncertainty; namely, identification of the infected population and the\npartially unknown sampling procedure.\n  In this work, by using a natural probabilistic model for \"viral infections\",\nwe design non-adaptive sampling procedures that allow successful identification\nof the infected population with overwhelming probability 1-o(1). We propose\nboth probabilistic and explicit design procedures that require a \"small\" number\nof agents to single out the infected individuals.

Each pool is then tested and defective items are\nidentified. A fundamental question involves minimizing the number of pools\nrequired to identify at most $d$ defective items. Motivated by applications in\nnetwork tomography, sensor networks and infection propagation, a variation of\ngroup testing problems on graphs is formulated. Unlike conventional group\ntesting problems, each group here must conform to the constraints imposed by a\ngraph. For instance, items can be associated with vertices and each pool is any\nset of nodes that must be path connected. In this paper, a test is associated\nwith a random walk. In this context, conventional group testing corresponds to\nthe special case of a complete graph on $n$ vertices.\n  For interesting classes of graphs a rather surprising result is obtained,\nnamely, that the number of tests required to identify $d$ defective items is\nsubstantially similar to what is required in conventional group testing\nproblems, where no such constraints on pooling is imposed. Specifically, if\nT(n) corresponds to the mixing time of the graph $G$, it is shown that with\n$m=O(d^2T^2(n)\\log(n/d))$ non-adaptive tests, one can identify the defective\nitems. Consequently, for the Erdos-Renyi random graph $G(n,p)$, as well as\nexpander graphs with constant spectral gap, it follows that $m=O(d^2\\log^3n)$\nnon-adaptive tests are sufficient to identify $d$ defective items.

To design a memetic algorithm one needs to make a host\nof decisions; selecting a population size is one of the most important among\nthem. Most algorithms in the literature fix the population size to a certain\nconstant value. This reduces the algorithm's quality since the optimal\npopulation size varies for different instances, local search procedures and\nrunning times. In this paper we propose an adjustable population size. It is\ncalculated as a function of the running time of the whole algorithm and the\naverage running time of the local search for the given instance. Note that in\nmany applications the running time of a heuristic should be limited and\ntherefore we use this limit as a parameter of the algorithm. The average\nrunning time of the local search procedure is obtained during the algorithm's\nrun.

For SAT and its counting version #SAT, hidden\nstructure has been exploited in terms of decomposability and strong backdoor\nsets. Decomposability can be considered in terms of the treewidth of a graph\nthat is associated with the given CNF formula, for instance by considering\nclauses and variables as vertices of the graph, and making a variable adjacent\nwith all the clauses it appears in. On the other hand, a strong backdoor set of\na CNF formula is a set of variables such that each possible partial assignment\nto this set moves the formula into a fixed class for which (#)SAT can be solved\nin polynomial time.\n  In this paper we combine the two above approaches. In particular, we study\nthe algorithmic question of finding a small strong backdoor set into the class\nW_t of CNF formulas whose associated graphs have treewidth at most t. The main\nresults are positive:\n  (1) There is a cubic-time algorithm that, given a CNF formula F and two\nconstants k,t\\ge 0, either finds a strong W_t-backdoor set of size at most 2^k,\nor concludes that F has no strong W_t-backdoor set of size at most k.\n  (2) There is a cubic-time algorithm that, given a CNF formula F, computes the\nnumber of satisfying assignments of F or concludes that sb_t(F)>k, for any pair\nof constants k,t\\ge 0.

In this\ncontext, the solution concept of interest becomes the logit equilibrium, as\nopposed to Nash equilibria. Logit equilibria are distributions over strategy\nprofiles that possess several nice properties, including existence and\nuniqueness. However, there are games in which their computation may take time\nexponential in the number of players. We therefore look at an approximate\nversion of logit equilibria, called metastable distributions, introduced by\nAuletta et al. [SODA 2012]. These are distributions that remain stable (i.e.,\nplayers do not go too far from it) for a super-polynomial number of steps\n(rather than forever, as for logit equilibria).

This property of\ninfinite words is shown to be an intrinsic property of the word and not of its\nlanguage (set of factors). For instance, every aperiodic word contains a non\nself-shuffling word in its shift orbit closure. While the property of being\nself-shuffling is a relatively strong condition, many important words arising\nin the area of symbolic dynamics are verified to be self-shuffling. They\ninclude for instance the Thue-Morse word and all Sturmian words of intercept\n$0<\\rho <1$ (while those of intercept $\\rho=0$ are not self-shuffling).

A cut (B,W) of G (a bipartition of V(G)) separates\na clique K and a stable set S if $K\\subseteq B$ and $S\\subseteq W$. A\nClique-Stable Set Separator is a family of cuts such that for every clique K,\nand for every stable set S disjoint from K, there exists a cut in the family\nthat separates K and S. Given a class of graphs, the question is to know\nwhether every graph of the class admits a Clique-Stable Set Separator\ncontaining only polynomially many cuts. It is open for the class of all graphs,\nand also for perfect graphs, which was Yannakakis' original question. Here we\ninvestigate on perfect graphs with no balanced skew-partition; the balanced\nskew-partition was introduced in the proof of the Strong Perfect Graph Theorem.\nRecently, Chudnovsky, Trotignon, Trunck and Vuskovic proved that forbidding\nthis unfriendly decomposition permits to recursively decompose Berge graphs\nusing 2-join and complement 2-join until reaching a basic graph, and they found\nan efficient combinatorial algorithm to color those graphs. We apply their\ndecomposition result to prove that perfect graphs with no balanced\nskew-partition admit a quadratic-size Clique-Stable Set Separator, by taking\nadvantage of the good behavior of 2-join with respect to this property. We then\ngeneralize this result and prove that the Strong Erdos-Hajnal property holds in\nthis class, which means that every such graph has a linear-size biclique or\ncomplement biclique. This property does not hold for all perfect graphs (Fox\n2006), and moreover when the Strong Erdos-Hajnal property holds in a hereditary\nclass of graphs, then both the Erdos-Hajnal property and the polynomial\nClique-Stable Set Separation hold. \n\n"}

As a result, we obtain closed formulas for the\nnumber of n-variable Boolean functions with depth k, which simultaneously\ngeneralizes enumeration formulas for canalizing, and nested canalizing\nfunctions. \n\n"}

We generalize both\nthe few-generator and the density models with probabilistic schemes that also\nallow variability in the size of tuples and non-uniform distributions on words\nof a given length.Our first results rely on a relatively mild prefix-heaviness\nhypothesis on the distributions, which states essentially that the probability\nof a word decreases exponentially fast as its length grows. Under this\nhypothesis, we generalize several classical results: exponentially generically\na randomly chosen tuple is a basis of the subgroup it generates, this subgroup\nis malnormal and the tuple satisfies a small cancellation property, even for\nexponential size tuples. In the special case of the uniform distribution on\nwords of a given length, we give a phase transition theorem for the central\ntree property, a combinatorial property closely linked to the fact that a tuple\nfreely generates a subgroup.

Our approach is based\non \"monotone local search\", where the goal is to extend a partial solution to a\nsolution by adding as few elements as possible.

Hence, a number of recent\npublications focus on row sampling in the streaming setting, using little more\nspace than what is required to store the outputted approximation [KL13,\nKLM+14].\n  Inspired by a growing body of work on online algorithms for machine learning\nand data analysis, we extend this work to a more restrictive online setting: we\nread rows of $A$ one by one and immediately decide whether each row should be\nkept in the spectral approximation or discarded, without ever retracting these\ndecisions.

Algorithms for generating networks with high clustering have been\ndeveloped, but typically rely on adding or removing edges and nodes, sometimes\nfrom a completely empty network.

While these\nalternate methods have seen increasing use in generating healthcare networks,\nthere is little to no literature comparing the differences in the structural\nproperties of the generated networks. To address this issue, we compared the\nproperties of healthcare networks constructed using different algorithms and\nthe 2013 Medicare Part B outpatient claims data. Three different algorithms\nwere compared: binning, sliding frame, and trace-route. Unipartite networks\nlinking either providers or healthcare organizations by shared patients were\nbuilt using each method.

Abstract: Coalescing random walks is a fundamental stochastic process, where a set of\nparticles perform independent discrete-time random walks on an undirected\ngraph. Whenever two or more particles meet at a given node, they merge and\ncontinue as a single random walk. The coalescence time is defined as the\nexpected time until only one particle remains, starting from one particle at\nevery node. Despite recent progress the coalescence time for graphs such as\nbinary trees, d-dimensional tori, hypercubes and more generally,\nvertex-transitive graphs, remains unresolved. We provide a powerful toolkit\nthat results in tight bounds for various topologies including the\naforementioned ones. The meeting time is defined as the worst-case expected\ntime required for two random walks to arrive at the same node at the same time.\nAs a general result, we establish that for graphs whose meeting time is only\nmarginally larger than the mixing time (a factor of log^2 n), the coalescence\ntime of n random walks equals the meeting time up to constant factors. This\nupper bound is complemented by the construction of a graph family demonstrating\nthat this result is the best possible up to constant factors. For\nalmost-regular graphs, we bound the coalescence time by the hitting time,\nresolving the discrete-time variant of a conjecture by Aldous for this class of\ngraphs. Finally, we prove that for any graph the coalescence time is bounded by\nO(n^3) (which is tight for the Barbell graph); surprisingly even such a basic\nquestion about the coalescing time was not answered before this work. By\nduality, our results give bounds on the voter model and therefore give bounds\non the consensus time in arbitrary undirected graphs. We also establish a new\nbound on the hitting time and cover time of regular graphs, improving and\ntightening previous results by Broder and Karlin, as well as those by Aldous\nand Fill. \n\n"}

Unfortunately, in many real-world environments, the ability to\nsample specific individual rows or columns of the matrix is limited by either\nsystem constraints or cost. In this paper, we consider matrix approximation by\nsampling predefined \\emph{blocks} of columns (or rows) from the matrix. We\npresent an algorithm for sampling useful column blocks and provide novel\nguarantees for the quality of the approximation. This algorithm has application\nin problems as diverse as biometric data analysis to distributed computing. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms for computing the\nBlock CUR decomposition of large matrices in a distributed setting with\nmultiple nodes in a compute cluster, where such blocks correspond to columns\n(or rows) of the matrix stored on the same node, which can be retrieved with\nmuch less overhead than retrieving individual columns stored across different\nnodes.

It can explain many behavioural phenomena such as the\nattraction, compromise, similarity effects and choice overload which cannot be\nexplained by the MNL model or any discrete choice model based on random\nutility.

We first study the classic problem of uniformly sampling\nsimple undirected, as well as bipartite, graphs with a given degree sequence.\nWe apply an embedding argument, involving a Markov chain defined by Jerrum and\nSinclair (TCS, 1990) for sampling graphs that almost have a given degree\nsequence, to show rapid mixing for degree sequences satisfying strong\nstability, a notion closely related to $P$-stability. This results in a much\nshorter proof that unifies the currently known rapid mixing results of the\nswitch chain and extends them up to sharp characterizations of $P$-stability.\nIn particular, our work resolves an open problem posed by Greenhill (SODA,\n2015).\n  Secondly, in order to illustrate the power of our approach, we study the\nproblem of uniformly sampling graphs for which, in addition to the degree\nsequence, a joint degree distribution is given.

A distance-two $r$-coloring\nof a graph $G$ is an assignment of $r$ colors to the vertices of $G$ so that\nany two vertices at distance at most two have different colors. Note that a\ncubic graph needs at least four colors. The distance-two four-coloring problem\nfor cubic planar graphs is known to be NP-complete. We claim the problem\nremains NP-complete for tri-connected bipartite cubic planar graphs, which we\ncall type-one Barnette graphs, since they are the first class identified by\nBarnette. By contrast, we claim the problem is polynomial for cubic plane\ngraphs with face sizes $3, 4, 5,$ or $6$, which we call type-two Barnette\ngraphs, because of their relation to Barnette's second conjecture.

Similar to CSPs, the tractability of promise CSPs can be tied\nto the structure of operations on the solution space called polymorphisms,\nthough in the promise world these operations are much less constrained. Under\nthe thesis that non-trivial polymorphisms govern tractability, promise CSPs\ntherefore provide a fertile ground for the discovery of novel algorithms.\n  In previous work, we classified Boolean promise CSPs when the constraint\npredicates are symmetric. In this work, we vastly generalize these algorithmic\nresults. Specifically, we show that promise CSPs that admit a family of\n\"regional-periodic\" polymorphisms are in P, assuming that determining which\nregion a point is in can be computed in polynomial time. Such polymorphisms are\nquite general and are obtained by gluing together several functions that are\nperiodic in the Hamming weights in different blocks of the input.\n  Our algorithm is based on a novel combination of linear programming and\nsolving linear systems over rings.

It was, however,\ncompletely plausible that a $3/2$-approximation is possible in linear time. In\nthis work we conditionally rule out such a possibility by showing that unless\nSETH fails no $O(m^{3/2-\\epsilon})$ time algorithm can achieve an approximation\nfactor better than $5/3$.\n  Another fundamental set of graph parameters are the Eccentricities. The\nEccentricity of a vertex $v$ is the distance between $v$ and the farthest\nvertex from $v$. Chechik et al. showed that the Eccentricities of all vertices\ncan be approximated within a factor of $5/3$ in $\\tilde{O}(m^{3/2})$ time and\nAbboud et al. showed that no $O(n^{2-\\epsilon})$ algorithm can achieve better\nthan $5/3$ approximation in sparse graphs. We show that the runtime of the\n$5/3$ approximation algorithm is also optimal under SETH. We also show that no\nnear-linear time algorithm can achieve a better than $2$ approximation for the\nEccentricities and that this is essentially tight: we give an algorithm that\napproximates Eccentricities within a $2+\\delta$ factor in $\\tilde{O}(m/\\delta)$\ntime for any $0<\\delta<1$.

This leads to one\nmain application of our work, establishing the first known barrier to improving\nthe nearly 20-year old bound of Katz-Trevisan (KT) on the dimension of LCCs.

A\npopular way to characterize a graph class is to list a minimal set of forbidden\ninduced subgraphs. Unfortunately this strategy usually does not lead to an\nefficient recognition algorithm. On the other hand, many graph classes can be\nefficiently recognized by techniques based on some interesting orderings of the\nnodes, such as the ones given by traversals.\n  We study specifically graph classes that have an ordering avoiding some\nordered structures. More precisely, we consider what we call patterns on three\nnodes, and the recognition complexity of the associated classes. In this\ndomain, there are two key previous works.

More broadly, any prior knowledge about\na signal's Fourier power spectrum can constrain its complexity. Intuitively,\nsignals with more highly constrained Fourier structure require fewer samples to\nreconstruct.\n  We formalize this intuition by showing that, roughly, a continuous signal\nfrom a given class can be approximately reconstructed using a number of samples\nproportional to the *statistical dimension* of the allowed power spectrum of\nthat class. Further, in nearly all settings, this natural measure tightly\ncharacterizes the sample complexity of signal reconstruction.\n  Surprisingly, we also show that, up to logarithmic factors, a universal\nnon-uniform sampling strategy can achieve this optimal complexity for *any\nclass of signals*.

This paper will describe a\nparticular implementation of a particle-swarm that can simulate the behavior of\nthe popular PageRank algorithm in both its {\\it global-rank} and {\\it\nrelative-rank} incarnations. PageRank is compared against the particle-swarm\nmethod on artificially generated scale-free networks of 1,000 nodes constructed\nusing a common gamma value, $\\gamma = 2.5$. The running time of the\nparticle-swarm algorithm is $O(|P|+|P|t)$ where $|P|$ is the size of the\nparticle population and $t$ is the number of particle propagation iterations.\nThe particle-swarm method is shown to be useful due to its ease of extension\nand running time. \n\n"}
{"id": "cs/0602067", "contents": "Title: Renyi to Renyi -- Source Coding under Siege Abstract: A novel lossless source coding paradigm applies to problems of unreliable\nlossless channels with low bit rates, in which a vital message needs to be\ntransmitted prior to termination of communications. This paradigm can be\napplied to Alfred Renyi's secondhand account of an ancient siege in which a spy\nwas sent to scout the enemy but was captured. After escaping, the spy returned\nto his base in no condition to speak and unable to write. His commander asked\nhim questions that he could answer by nodding or shaking his head, and the\nfortress was defended with this information. Renyi told this story with\nreference to prefix coding, but maximizing probability of survival in the siege\nscenario is distinct from yet related to the traditional source coding\nobjective of minimizing expected codeword length. Rather than finding a code\nminimizing expected codeword length $\\sum_{i=1}^n p(i) l(i)$, the siege problem\ninvolves maximizing $\\sum_{i=1}^n p(i) \\theta^{l(i)}$ for a known $\\theta \\in\n(0,1)$. When there are no restrictions on codewords, this problem can be solve\nusing a known generalization of Huffman coding. The optimal solution has coding\nbounds which are functions of Renyi entropy; in addition to known bounds, new\nbounds are derived here. The alphabetically constrained version of this problem\nhas applications in search trees and diagnostic testing. A novel dynamic\nprogramming algorithm -- based upon the oldest known algorithm for the\ntraditional alphabetic problem -- optimizes this problem in $O(n^3)$ time and\n$O(n^2)$ space, whereas two novel approximation algorithms can find a\nsuboptimal solution faster: one in linear time, the other in $O(n \\log n)$.\nCoding bounds for the alphabetic version of this problem are also presented. \n\n"}
