It has also\nrecently been found that electromagnetic radiative corrections in some cases\nmay boost the gamma-ray yield from supersymmetric dark matter annihilations in\nthe galactic halo by up to three or four orders of magnitude, providing\ndistinct spectral signatures for indirect dark matter searches to look for.\nHere, we investigate whether the same type of corrections can also lead to\nsizeable enhancements in the positron yield. We find that this is indeed the\ncase, albeit for a smaller region of parameter space than for gamma rays;\nselecting models with a small mass difference between the neutralino and\nsleptons, like in the stau coannihilation region in mSUGRA, the effect becomes\nmore pronounced.

For this we consider a\nthree-brane that moves under the influence of a seven dimensional pure Hilbert\nEinstein-like generally covariant theory. We introduce a change of variables\nthat combines the conformal scale of the metric tensor with the brane\nfluctuations, so that the conformal scale becomes the modulus and the\nfluctuations become the angular field degrees of freedom of a polarly\ndecomposed Higgs. When we assume that the four dimensional space-time\nbackground of the generally covariant theory is locally conformally flat and\nthat the internal space is a squashed three-sphere, we arrive at one massless\nand three massive vector fields akin those in the Weinberg-Salam model and\nrecover all the familiar ingredients of the symmetry broken bosonic\nWeinberg-Salam model, except that there is no bare Higgs mass.

As a specific example, we consider a model with gauged B - L_e - 2\nL_tau number that contains an extremely light new vector boson m_Z' < 10^-18 eV\nand extraordinarily weak coupling alpha' < 10^-52. In that case, differences\nbetween nu_mu to nu_tau and anti-nu_mu to anti-nu_tau oscillations can result\nfrom a long-range potential due to neutrons in the Earth and the Sun that\ndistinguishes nu_mu and nu_tau on Earth, with a potential difference of ~\n6*10^-14 eV, and changes sign for anti-neutrinos.

This observation threatens the viability of electroweak\nbaryogenesis, which favors, for example, a lighter Higgs and a Higgs coupled to\nor mixed with light scalars. To assess the broad impact of these constraints,\nwe propose a scheme for classifying models of the electroweak phase transition\nand impose constraints on a class-by-class basis. We find that models, such as\nthe MSSM, which rely on thermal loop effects are severely constrained by the\nmeasurement of a 125 GeV Higgs.

LBNE\nis conceived around three central components: (1) a new, high-intensity\nneutrino source generated from a megawatt-class proton accelerator at Fermi\nNational Accelerator Laboratory, (2) a near neutrino detector just downstream\nof the source, and (3) a massive liquid argon time-projection chamber deployed\nas a far detector deep underground at the Sanford Underground Research\nFacility. This facility, located at the site of the former Homestake Mine in\nLead, South Dakota, is approximately 1,300 km from the neutrino source at\nFermilab -- a distance (baseline) that delivers optimal sensitivity to neutrino\ncharge-parity symmetry violation and mass ordering effects. This ambitious yet\ncost-effective design incorporates scalability and flexibility and can\naccommodate a variety of upgrades and contributions. With its exceptional\ncombination of experimental configuration, technical capabilities, and\npotential for transformative discoveries, LBNE promises to be a vital facility\nfor the field of particle physics worldwide, providing physicists from around\nthe globe with opportunities to collaborate in a twenty to thirty year program\nof exciting science. In this document we provide a comprehensive overview of\nLBNE's scientific objectives, its place in the landscape of neutrino physics\nworldwide, the technologies it will incorporate and the capabilities it will\npossess. \n\n"}

They\nconstrain, at each order n, the q^n behavior of the soft limits. In this paper\nwe show that all consistency relations derive from a single, master identity,\nwhich follows from the Slavnov-Taylor identity for spatial diffeomorphisms.\nThis master identity is valid at any value of q and therefore goes beyond the\nsoft limit.

As a possible explanation, the\nhydrodynamic description of the collision process was tentatively proposed.\nHowever, such effect, (albeit much weaker) also exists in the ratio of\ndata/fits, both in nuclear $Pb+Pb$ collisions, and in the elementary $p+p$ data\nin the same range of transverse momenta for which such an explanation is\ndoubtful.

In gauge\nmediated SUSY breaking models, sufficiently large Q-balls with baryon charge\nare stable while Q-balls with lepton charge can always decay into leptons. For\na Q-ball that carries nonzero $B$ and $L$ charges, the difference between the\nbaryonic component and the leptonic component in decay rate may induce nonzero\nelectric charge on the Q-ball. This implies that charged Q-ball, also called\ngauged Q-ball, may emerge in our universe.

Since the classically conformal symmetry forbids all dimensional\nparameters in the model, the U(1)' gauge symmetry is broken by the\nColeman-Weinberg mechanism, generating the mass terms of the U(1)' gauge boson\n($Z$' boson) and the right-handed neutrinos. Through a mixing quartic coupling\nbetween the U(1)' Higgs field and the SM Higgs doublet field, the radiative\nU(1)' gauge symmetry breaking also triggers the breaking of the electroweak\nsymmetry.

The coordinate singularity of the FRW patch is identified\nwith the proper time at which the Hilbert space of the causal diamond becomes\ninfinite dimensional. For diamonds much smaller than the AdS radius, RAdS, the\ntime dependent Hamiltonians of HST are the same as those used to describe\nsimilar diamonds in Minkowski space. In particular, they are invariant under\nthe fuzzy analog of volume preserving diffeomorphisms of the holographic\nscreen, which leads to fast scrambling of perturbations on the horizon of a\nblack hole of size smaller than RAdS. We argue that, in order to take a limit\nof this system which converges to a CFT, one must choose Hamiltonians, in a\nrange of proper times of order RAdS, which break this invariance, and become\nlocal in a particular choice of basis for the variables. We show that,\nbeginning with flat, sub-RAdS, patches of dimension D, the resulting CFT,\nconstructed from the variables of HST, is inconsistent with the entropy of\nlarge black holes, unless one has at least two compact dimensions, whose size\nis of order RAdS.

When relating\nthe black-hole electric charges to the baryon-chemical potentials it was found\nthat the phenomenologically-deduced parameters from various particle ratios in\nthe statistical thermal models agree well with the ones determined from the\nthermal radiation from charged black-hole. Accordingly, the resulting freezeout\nconditions, such as $s/T^3=7$ and $<E>/<N>=1~$GeV, are confirmed at finite\nchemical potentials, as well. Furthermore, the problematic of strangeness\nproduction in elementary collisions can be interpreted by thermal particle\nproduction from the Hawking-Unruh radiation. Consequently, the freezeout\ntemperature depends on the quark masses. This leads to a deviation from full\nequilibrium and thus a suppression of the strangeness production in the\nelementary collisions. But in nucleus-nucleus collisions, an average\ntemperature should be introduced in order to dilute the quark masses. This\nnearly removes the strangeness suppression. An extension to finite chemical\npotentials is introduced. The particle ratios of kaon-to-pion, phi-to-kaon and\nantilambda-to-pion are determined from Hawking-Unruh radiation and compared\nwith the thermal calculations and the measurements in different experiments.

{"id": "1805.10299", "contents": "Title: Revisiting Lorentz violation in Horava gravity Abstract: In the context of Horava gravity, the most promising known scenarios to\nrecover Lorentz invariance at low energy are the possibilities that (1) the\nrenormalization group flow of the system leads to emergent infrared Lorentz\ninvariance, and (2) that supersymmetry protects infrared Lorentz invariance. A\nthird scenario proposes that a classically Lorentz invariant matter sector with\ncontrolled quantum corrections may simply co-exist with Horava gravity under\ncertain conditions. However, for non-projectable Horava gravity in 3+1\ndimensions it is known that, in the absence of additional structures, this\nmechanism is spoiled by unexpected power-law divergences. We confirm this same\nresult in the projectable version of the theory by employing the recently found\ngauge-fixing term that renders the shift and graviton propagators regular. We\nshow that the problem persists for all dimensions $D\\geq 3$, and that the\ndegree of fine tuning in squared sound speeds between a U(1) gauge field and a\nscalar field increases with $D$. In particular, this difference in the zero\nexternal momentum limit is proportional to $\\Lambda^{D-1}$ for $D\\geq 3$, where\n$\\Lambda$ is the ultraviolet momentum cutoff for loop integrals, while the\npower-law divergences are absent for $D=1$ and $D=2$. These results suggest\nthat not only the gravity sector but also the matter sector should exhibit a\ntransition to Lifshitz scaling above some scale, and that there should not be a\nlarge separation between the transition scales in the gravity and matter\nsectors. We close with a discussion of other more promising scenarios,\nincluding emergent Lorentz invariance from supersymmetry/strong dynamics, and\npointing out challenges where they exist. \n\n"}

In this paper, we discuss the behaviour of the\nperturbative wavefunction as its other singularities are approached and the\nrole played by the flat-space scattering, in the simplified context of the\nclass of toy models admitting a first principle definition in terms of\ncosmological polytopes. The problems then translates into the analysis of the\nstructure of its facets, one of which -- the scattering facet -- beautifully\nencodes the flat-space S-matrix. We show that all the boundaries of the\ncosmological polytope encode information about the flat-space physics. In\nparticular, a subset of its facets turns out to have a similar structure as the\nscattering facet, with the vertices which can be grouped together to form lower\ndimensional scattering facets. The other facets admit one (and only one)\ntriangulation in terms of products of lower dimensional scattering facets. As a\nconsequence, the whole perturbative wavefunction can be represented as a sum of\nproduct of flat-space scattering amplitudes.

We argue that the most\npromising way to test this hypothesis is to look for possible imprints of\nmagnetic fields on the temperature and polarization anisotropies of the cosmic\nmicrowave background radiation (CMBR). With this purpose in mind, we provide a\nreview of the most relevant effects of magnetic fields on the CMBR.

If these jets contain cold protons and heavy ions (as\nin SS433), it is plausible that this component will consist of a narrow\nspectral feature, with a mean particle energy corresponding roughly to the bulk\nkinetic particle energy in the beam, Gamma_jet m c^2, which, based on current\nestimates of Gamma_jet, falls into the range of 3-10 GeV. The presence of\nseveral sources with different Gamma_jet will lead to superposition of several\nsuch peaks. Additionally, diffusive particle acceleration should produce a\npowerlaw whose low energy cutoff at or above Gamma_jet^2 m c^2 would be visible\nas another spectral feature.

Within the family\nof electromagnetic systems, one still has a great variety of possible\ngeometrical configurations, classical and quantum states of the electromagnetic\nfield, detection strategies, etc. According to evaluations performed 30 years\nago, the gap between the HFGW laboratory signal and its level of detectability\nis at least 4 orders of magnitude. Hopefully, new technologies of today can\nremove this gap and can make the laboratory experiment feasible. The laboratory\nexperiment is bound to be expensive, but one should remember that a part of the\ncost is likely to be reimbursed from the Nobel prize money ! Electromagnetic\nsystems seem also appropriate for the detection of high-frequency end of the\nspectrum of relic gravitational waves. Although the current effort to observe\nthe stochastic background of relic gravitational waves is focused on the\nopposite, very low-frequency, end of the spectrum, it would be extremely\nvaluable for fundamental science to detect, or put sensible upper limits on,\nthe high-frequency relic gravitational waves. I will briefly discuss the origin\nof relic gravitational waves, the expected level of their high-frequency\nsignal, and the existing estimates of its detectability. \n\n"}

The first\nis a general structure theorem for spacetimes obeying a certain convexity\ncondition near infinity, analogous to the structure theorems of Cheeger and\nGromoll for manifolds of non-negative Ricci curvature. For spacetimes with\nRicci-flat conformal boundary, the convexity condition is associated with\nnegative mass. The second theorem is a uniqueness theorem for the negative mass\nAdS soliton spacetime. This result lends support to the new positive mass\nconjecture due to Horowitz and Myers which states that the unique lowest mass\nsolution which asymptotes to the AdS soliton is the soliton itself. This\nconjecture was motivated by a nonsupersymmetric version of the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence. Our results add to the growing body of rigorous mathematical\nresults inspired by the AdS/CFT correspondence conjecture. Our techniques\nexploit a special geometric feature which the universal cover of the soliton\nspacetime shares with familiar ``ground state'' spacetimes such as Minkowski\nspacetime, namely, the presence of a null line, or complete achronal null\ngeodesic, and the totally geodesic null hypersurface that it determines.

An example -- supported by Weinberg's successful prediction of the\ncosmological constant -- is the potentially vast landscape of vacua in string\ntheory, where the existence of galaxies and atoms is promoted to a vacuum\nselection criterion. Then, low energy SUSY becomes unnecessary, and\nsupersymmetry -- if present in the fundamental theory -- can be broken near the\nunification scale. All the scalars of the supersymmetric standard model become\nultraheavy, except for a single finely tuned Higgs. Yet, the fermions of the\nsupersymmetric standard model can remain light, protected by chiral symmetry,\nand account for the successful unification of gauge couplings. This framework\nremoves all the difficulties of the SSM: the absence of a light Higgs and\nsparticles, dimension five proton decay, SUSY flavor and CP problems, and the\ncosmological gravitino and moduli problems.

Conversely, if Rn-Rp>0.25 fm, the direct URCA process is allowed\n(by all models) to cool down a 1.4 solar-mass neutron star. The Parity Radius\nExperiment at Jefferson Laboratory aims to measure the neutron radius in 208Pb\naccurately and model independently via parity-violating electron scattering.\nSuch a measurement would greatly enhance our ability to either confirm or\ndismiss the direct URCA cooling of neutron stars. \n\n"}

The applicability of its basic factorization\nassumption is clarified. An approximate scaling of the basic observables with\nthe phase space density is demonstrated in the low density (gas) limit. This\nscaling and also its violation at high densities due to the condensate\nformation is described by approximate analytical formulae which allow, in\nprinciple, for the identification of the multiboson effects among others. For\nmoderate densities indicated by the experimental data, a fast saturation of\nmultiboson effects with the number of contributing cumulants is obtained,\nallowing for the account of these effects in realistic transport code\nsimulations. At high densities, the spectra are mainly determined by the\nuniversal condensate term and the initially narrow Poisson multiplicity\ndistribution approaches a wide Bose-Einstein one. As a result, the intercepts\nof the inclusive and fixed-$n$ correlation functions (properly normalized to 1\nat large relative momenta) approach 2 and 1, respectively and their widths\nlogarithmically increase with the increasing phase space density. It is shown\nthat the neglect of energy-momentum constraints in the model is justified\nexcept near a multipion threshold, where these constraints practically exclude\nthe possibility of a very cold condensate production. It is argued that\nspectacular multiboson effects are likely to be observed only in the rare\nevents containing sufficiently high density (speckle) fluctuations. \n\n"}

Scalar Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac-Langevin Equation, Radiation Reaction and\n  Vacuum Fluctuations Abstract: We apply the open systems concept and the influence functional formalism\nintroduced in Paper I to establish a stochastic theory of relativistic moving\nspinless particles in a quantum scalar field. The stochastic regime resting\nbetween the quantum and semi-classical captures the statistical mechanical\nattributes of the full theory. Applying the particle-centric world-line\nquantization formulation to the quantum field theory of scalar QED we derive a\ntime-dependent (scalar) Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac (ALD) equation and show that it\nis the correct semiclassical limit for nonlinear particle-field systems without\nthe need of making the dipole or non-relativistic approximations. Progressing\nto the stochastic regime, we derive multiparticle ALD-Langevin equations for\nnonlinearly coupled particle-field systems. With these equations we show how to\naddress time-dependent dissipation/noise/renormalization in the semiclassical\nand stochastic limits of QED. We clarify the the relation of radiation\nreaction, quantum dissipation and vacuum fluctuations and the role that initial\nconditions may play in producing non-Lorentz invariant noise. We emphasize the\nfundamental role of decoherence in reaching the semiclassical limit, which also\nsuggests the correct way to think about the issues of runaway solutions and\npreacceleration from the presence of third derivative terms in the ALD\nequation. We show that the semiclassical self-consistent solutions obtained in\nthis way are ``paradox'' and pathology free both technically and conceptually.\nThis self-consistent treatment serves as a new platform for investigations into\nproblems related to relativistic moving charges. \n\n"}
