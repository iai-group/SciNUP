Twin matter is\nhypothetical matter that might couple directly only to the second metric of the\ntheory. Considerations of cosmology in the BIMOND framework suggest that such\nTM might exist and copy matter in its attributes. Here I investigate the\nindirect interactions that BIMOND theories predict between nonrelativistic\nmasses of matter and TM. The most salient result is that in the deep-MOND\nregime of the matter-TM-symmetric theories, TM behaves as if it has a negative\ngravitational mass. To wit, interaction within each sector is attractive MOND\ngravity, but between matter and TM it is repulsive MOND gravity. In the\nhigh-acceleration regime, the interaction depends on a parameter, beta. For the\nfavored value beta=1, matter and TM do not interact in this regime; for beta<1\nthey attract; and for beta>1 they repel each other. Such interactions may have\nsubstantial ramifications for all aspects of structure formation, such as\nmatter distribution, peculiar velocities, and effects on the CMB. The repulsive\ninteractions probably lead to segregation of matter and TM structures, leading,\nin turn, to intermeshing of the respective cosmic webs, with high-density nodes\nof one sector residing in the voids of the other (possibly conducing to\nefficient evacuation of the voids). Weak lensing by TM seems the best way to\nconstrain its attributes. In the MOND regime a TM body acts on matter photons\nas a diverging lens.

Unit invariance is achieved by introducing a gauge\nfield called the scale, designed to measure how unit systems vary from point to\npoint. In fact, by a uniform and simple Weyl invariant coupling of scale and\nmatter fields, we unify massless, massive, and partially massless excitations.\nAs a consequence, masses now dictate the response of physical quantities to\nchanges of scale.

The model passes solar-system tests at the\npost-Newtonian order, including those of local Lorentz invariance, and its\nanomalous forces in binary-pulsar systems are orders of magnitude smaller than\nthe tightest experimental constraints. The large-distance behavior is obtained\nas in Bekenstein's tensor-vector-scalar (TeVeS) model, but with several\nsimplifications. In particular, no fine-tuned function is needed to interpolate\nbetween the MOND and Newtonian regimes, and no dynamics needs to be defined for\nthe vector field because preferred-frame effects are negligible at small\ndistances.

The asymptotics of the spinfoam amplitude is determined by the\ncritical configurations. Here we show that, given a critical configuration in\ngeneral, there exists a partition of the simplicial complex into three type of\nregions R_{Nondeg}, R_{Deg-A}, R_{Deg-B}, where the three regions are\nsimplicial sub-complexes with boundaries. The critical configuration implies\ndifferent types of geometries in different types of regions, i.e. (1) the\ncritical configuration restricted into R_{Nondeg}$ implies a nondegenerate\ndiscrete Lorentzian geometry, (2) the critical configuration restricted into\nR_{Deg-A}$ is degenerate of type-A in our definition of degeneracy, but implies\na nondegenerate discrete Euclidean geometry on R_{Deg-A}, (3) the critical\nconfiguration restricted into R_{Deg-B} is degenerate of type-B, and implies a\nvector geometry on R_{Deg-B}.

Despite infinite tidal forces the geodesics pass through the\nsingularity. Due to the dust component, the Hubble parameter has a non-zero\nvalue at the encounter with the singularity, therefore the dust implies further\nexpansion. With continued expansion however, the energy density and the\npressure of the anti-Chaplygin gas would become ill-defined, hence from the\npoint of view of the anti-Chaplygin gas only a contraction is allowed.\nParadoxically, the universe in this cosmological model would have to expand and\ncontract simultaneously. This obviosly could not happen. We solve the paradox\nby redefining the anti-Chaplygin gas in a distributional sense.

We study the evolution of three alternative\ninitial data schemes. Two of the three alternatives are based on post-Newtonian\nexpansions that contain realistic gravitational waves. The first scheme is\nbased on a second-order post-Newtonian expansion in Arnowitt, Deser, and Misner\ntransverse-traceless (ADMTT) gauge that has been resummed to approach standard\npuncture data at the black holes. The second scheme is based on asymptotic\nmatching of the 4-metrics of two tidally perturbed Schwarzschild solutions to a\nfirst-order post-Newtonian expansion in ADMTT gauge away from the black holes.\nThe final alternative is obtained through asymptotic matching of the 4-metrics\nof two tidally perturbed Schwarzschild solutions to a second-order\npost-Newtonian expansion in harmonic gauge away from the black holes. When\nevolved, the second scheme fails to produce quasicircular orbits (and instead\nleads to a nearly head-on collision). This failure can be traced back to\ninaccuracies in the extrinsic curvature due to low order matching. More\nencouraging is that the latter two alternatives lead to quasicircular orbits\nand show gravitational radiation from the onset of the evolution, as well as a\nreduction of spurious radiation. Current deficiencies compared to standard\npunctures data include more eccentric trajectories during the inspiral and\nlarger constraint violations, since the alternative data sets are only\napproximate solutions of Einstein's equations.

Here we extend this framework by localizing the\nangular momentum of the linearized gravitational field, deriving a\ngravitational spin tensor which possesses similarly desirable properties.

This spin tensor is\nthen uniquely determined by requiring that it obey two simple physically\nmotivated algebraic conditions. Firstly, the spin of an arbitrary\n(harmonic-gauge) gravitational plane wave is required to flow in the direction\nof propagation of the wave. Secondly, the spin tensor of any\ntransverse-traceless gravitational field is required to be traceless.

This is shown\nto be a universal quantity in the sense that it doesn't depend on the gauge\ncoupling and the gauge group, but may depend on the other couplings of the\naction (gravitational and matter). The coupled system is studied at one-loop.\nIt is found that the leading term of gauge beta function is zero at one-loop in\nfour dimensions. The effect of gauge fields on the running of gravitational\ncouplings is investigated. The coupled system of gauge field with\nhigher-derivative gravity is shown to satisfy unitarity when quantum\ncorrections are taken in to account. Moreover, it is found that Newton constant\ngoes to zero at short distances. In this renormalizable and unitary theory of\ngauge field coupled with higher-derivative gravity, the leading term of the\ngauge beta function, found to be universal for all gauge groups, is further\nstudied in more detail by isolating it in the context of abelian gauge theories\ncoupled with gravity in four dimensions. Using self-duality of abelian gauge\ntheories in four dimensions, this term of the gauge beta function is shown to\nbe zero to all loops. This is found to be independent of the gravity action,\nregularization scheme and gauge fixing condition. An explicit one-loop\ncomputation for arbitrary gravity action further demonstrates the vanishing of\nthis term in the gauge beta function in four dimensions, independent of the\nregularization scheme and gauge fixing condition. Consequences of this are\ndiscussed. \n\n"}

One traditionally\nwaits for the junk radiation to exit the computational domain before taking\nphysical readings, at the expense of throwing away a segment of the evolution,\nand with the hope that junk radiation exits cleanly. We argue that this hope\ndoes not necessarily pan out as junk radiation could excite long-lived\nconstraint violation. Another complication with the initial data is that it\ncontains orbital eccentricity that needs to be removed, usually by evolving the\nearly part of the inspiral multiple times with gradually improved input\nparameters. We show that this procedure is also adversely impacted by junk\nradiation. In this paper, we do not attempt to eliminate junk radiation\ndirectly, but instead tackle the much simpler problem of ameliorating its\nlong-lasting effects. We report on the success of a method that achieves this\ngoal by combining the removal of junk radiation and eccentricity into a single\n\"joint-elimination\" procedure. This approach has the following benefits: (1) We\ndo not have to contend with the influence of junk radiation on eccentricity\nmeasurements for later iterations of the eccentricity reduction procedure. (2)\nWe re-enforce constraints periodically by invoking the initial data solver,\nremoving the constraint violation excited by junk radiation previously.

State Space Abstract: Instead of formulating the state space of a quantum field theory over one big\nHilbert space, it has been proposed by Kijowski to describe quantum states as\nprojective families of density matrices over a collection of smaller, simpler\nHilbert spaces. Beside the physical motivations for this approach, it could\nhelp designing a quantum state space holding the states we need. In\n[Oko{\\l}\\'ow 2013, arXiv:1304.6330] the description of a theory of Abelian\nconnections within this framework was developed, an important insight being to\nuse building blocks labeled by combinations of edges and surfaces. The present\nwork generalizes this construction to an arbitrary gauge group G (in\nparticular, G is neither assumed to be Abelian nor compact). This involves\nrefining the definition of the label set, as well as deriving explicit formulas\nto relate the Hilbert spaces attached to different labels.\n  If the gauge group happens to be compact, we also have at our disposal the\nwell-established Ashtekar-Lewandowski Hilbert space, which is defined as an\ninductive limit using building blocks labeled by edges only. We then show that\nthe quantum state space presented here can be thought as a natural extension of\nthe space of density matrices over this Hilbert space.

Here,\nwe show that neither violation need hold, since, in arguing that black holes\nlead to cloning or non-monogamy, one needs to assume a tensor product structure\nbetween two points in space-time that could instead be viewed as causally\nconnected. In the latter case, one is violating the semi-classical causal\nstructure of space, which is a strictly weaker implication than cloning or\nnon-monogamy. We show that the lack of monogamy that can emerge in evaporating\nspace times is one that is allowed in quantum mechanics, and is very naturally\nrelated to a lack of monogamy of correlations of outputs of measurements\nperformed at subsequent instances of time of a single system. A particular\nexample of this is the Horowitz-Maldacena proposal, and we argue that it\nneedn't lead to cloning or violations of entanglement monogamy.

This paper continues this exploration by examination\nof the effect of space and time dependent number scaling on theoretical\ndescriptions of some physical and geometric quantities. Fiber bundles provide a\ngood framework to introduce a space and time or space time dependent number\nscaling field. The effect of the scaling field on a few nonlocal physical and\ngeometric quantities is described. The effect on gauge theories is to introduce\na new complex scalar field into the derivatives appearing in Lagrangians. U(1)\ninvariance of Lagrangian terms does not affect the real part of the scaling\nfield. For this field, any mass is possible. The scaling field is also shown to\naffect quantum wave packets and path lengths, and geodesic equations even on\nflat space. Scalar fields described so far in physics, are possible candidates\nfor the scaling field. The lack of direct evidence for the field in physics\nrestricts the scaling field in that the gradient of the field must be close to\nzero in a local region of cosmological space and time. There are no\nrestrictions outside the region. It is also seen that the scaling field does\nnot affect comparisons of computation or measurements outputs with one another.\nHowever it does affect the assignment of numerical values to the outputs of\ncomputations or measurements.

It follows\nthat the standard notion of observable has to be extended to include\nnon-differentiable or even discontinuous generalized observables. These cannot\ncarry Poisson-algebraic structures and do not admit a standard quantization;\none thus faces a quantum representation problem of gravitational observables.\nThis has deep consequences for a quantum theory of gravity, which we\ninvestigate in a simple model for a system with Hamiltonian constraint that\nfails to be completely integrable. We show that basing the quantization on\nstandard topology precludes a semiclassical limit and can even prohibit any\nsolutions to the quantum constraints. Our proposed solution to this problem is\nto refine topology such that a complete set of Dirac observables becomes\ncontinuous. In the toy model, it turns out that a refinement to a polymer-type\ntopology, as e.g. used in loop gravity, is sufficient.

It has been argued that this is an\nanalogue for quantum processes in the presence of closed timelike curves\n(CTCs). The unusual properties of states of quantum communication networks that\nfulfill the D-CTC condition have been discussed extensively in recent\nliterature. In this work, the D-CTC condition is investigated in the framework\nof quantum field theory in the local, operator-algebraic approach due to Haag\nand Kastler. It is shown that the D-CTC condition cannot be fulfilled in states\nwhich are analytic for the energy, or satisfy the Reeh-Schlieder property, for\na certain class of processes and initial conditions.

The magnitude of this damping, evaluated by Bildsten and\nUshomirsky (BU) under the assumption of a perfectly rigid crust, sets the\nmaximum spin frequency for a neutron star spun up by accretion in a Low-Mass\nX-ray binary (LMXB). In this paper we explore the mechanical coupling between\nthe core r-modes and the elastic crust, using a toy model of a constant density\nneutron star with a constant shear modulus crust. We find that, at spin\nfrequencies in excess of ~50 Hz, the r-modes strongly penetrate the crust. This\nreduces the relative motion (slippage) between the crust and the core compared\nto the rigid crust limit. We therefore revise down, by as much as a factor of\n10^2-10^3, the damping rate computed by BU, significantly reducing the maximal\npossible spin frequency of neutron star with a solid crust. The dependence of\nthe crust-core slippage on the spin frequency is complicated, and is very\nsensitive to the physical thickness of the crust.

For a perfect fluid negative presure leads to\ninstabilities that are most severe on the shortest scales. However, if instead\nthe dark matter is a solid, with an elastic resistance to pure shear\ndeformations, an equation of state with negative presure can avoid these short\nwavelength instabilities.

Two possible candidates for a solid dark matter\ncomponent are a frustrated network of non-Abelian cosmic strings or a\nfrustrated network of domain walls. If these networks settle down to an\nequilibrium configuration that gets carried along and stretched by the Hubble\nflow, equations of state result with $w=-1/3$ and $w=-2/3,$ respectively.

Due to the\nrelative smallness of the solar angular momentum J and the large values of the\nplanetary semimajor axes a, the gravitomagnetic precessions, which affect the\nnodes Omega and the perihelia omega and are proportional to J/a^3, are of the\norder of 10^-3 arcseconds per century only for, e.g., Mercury. This value lies\njust at the edge of the present-day observational sensitivity in reconstructing\nthe planetary orbits, although future missions to Mercury like Messenger and\nBepiColombo could allow to increase it. The major problems come from the main\nsources of systematic errors.

The quantum dynamics of AQG is governed by a\nsingle Master Constraint operator. While AQG is inspired by Loop Quantum\nGravity (LQG), it differs drastically from it because in AQG there is\nfundamentally no topology or differential structure. A natural Hilbert space\nrepresentation acquires the structure of an infinite tensor product (ITP) whose\nseparable strong equivalence class Hilbert subspaces (sectors) are left\ninvariant by the quantum dynamics. The missing information about the topology\nand differential structure of the spacetime manifold as well as about the\nbackground metric to be approximated is supplied by coherent states. Given such\ndata, the corresponding coherent state defines a sector in the ITP which can be\nidentified with a usual QFT on the given manifold and background. Thus, AQG\ncontains QFT on all curved spacetimes at once, possibly has something to say\nabout topology change and provides the contact with the familiar low energy\nphysics.

In contrast to the electromagnetic case, in which there are two\ndifferent charges, i.e., the electric charge and the mass, the gravitational\ncounterpart has only one charge. This fact prevents us from using the same\nrenormalization scheme that was used in the electromagnetic case.

II.\n  Variations of the vector field and the projection tensor in the general case\n  and under definite assumptions Abstract: The purpose of the paper is to develop further a projection variational\napproach in relativistic hydrodynamics. The approach, previously proposed in\n[gr-qc/9908032], is based on the variation of the vector field and the\nprojection tensor (instead of the given metric tensor) and their first partial\nderivatives. The previously proved property of non-commutativity of the\nvariation and the partial derivative in respect to the projection tensor has\nbeen used to find all the variations. Subsequently, motivated by some analogy\nwith the well-known (3+1) ADM projection formalism, an assumption has been made\nabout a zero-covariant derivative of the projection tensor in respect to the\nprojection connection. The combination of the equations for the variations of\nthe projective tensor with covariant and contravariant indices has lead to the\nderivation of an important and concisely written relation: the derivative of\nthe vector field length is equal to the ''twice'' projected along the vector\nfield initial Christoffell connection.

Our generalization\nrelaxes the standard transversality assumption and encompasses the common\nsituation where the reduced differential equations for the group invariant\nsolutions involve both fewer dependent and independent variables. The\ntheoretical basis for our method is provided by a general existence theorem for\nthe invariant sections, both local and global, of a bundle on which a finite\ndimensional Lie group acts. A simple and natural extension of our\ncharacterization of invariant sections leads to an intrinsic characterization\nof the reduced equations for the group invariant solutions for a system of\ndifferential equations. The characterization of both the invariant sections and\nthe reduced equations are summarized schematically by the kinematic and dynamic\nreduction diagrams and are illustrated by a number of examples from fluid\nmechanics, harmonic maps, and general relativity. This work also provides the\ntheoretical foundations for a further detailed study of the reduced equations\nfor group invariant solutions. \n\n"}

Spherical manifolds and\n  related examples Abstract: We exhibit large classes of examples of noncommutative finite-dimensional\nmanifolds which are (non-formal) deformations of classical manifolds.

We find a 3-parameter family of\ndeformations $S^3_{\\mathbf{u}}$ of the standard 3-sphere $S^3$ and a\ncorresponding 3-parameter deformation of the 4-dimensional Euclidean space\n$\\mathbb R^4$. For generic values of the deformation parameters we show that\nthe obtained algebras of polynomials on the deformed $\\mathbb R^4_{\\mathbf{u}}$\nonly depend on two parameters and are isomorphic to the algebras introduced by\nSklyanin in connection with the Yang-Baxter equation. It follows that different\n$S^3_{\\mathbf{u}}$ can span the same $\\mathbb R^4_{\\mathbf{u}}$. This\nequivalence generates a foliation of the parameter space $\\Sigma $. This\nfoliation admits singular leaves reduced to a point.

Abstract: A theory of time and space with fractional dimensions (FD) of time and space\n($d_{\\alpha}, \\alpha=t,{\\bf r})$ defined on multifractal sets is proposed. The\nFD is determined (using principle of minimum the functionals of FD) by the\nenergy densities of Lagrangians of known physical fields. To describe behaviour\nof functions defined on multifractal sets the generalizations of the fractional\nRiemann-Liouville derivatives $D_{t}^{d(t)}$ are introduced with the order of\ndifferentiation (depending on time and coordinate) being equal the value of\nfractional dimension. For $d_{t}=const$ the generalized fractional derivatives\n(GFD) reduce to ordinary Riemann-Liouville integral functionals, and when\n$d_{t}$ is close to integer, GFD can be represented by means of derivatives of\ninteger order. For time and space with fractional dimensions a method to\ninvestigate the generalized equations of theoretical physics by means of GFD is\nproposed. The Euler equations defined on multifractal sets of time and space\nare obtained using the principle of the minimum of FD functionals. As an\nexample, a generalized Newton equation is considered and it is shown that this\nequation coincide with the equation of classical limit of general theory of\nrelativity for $d_{t} \\to 1$. Several remarks concerning existence of repulsive\ngravitation are discussed.

{"id": "quant-ph/0112056", "contents": "Title: Fluctuations of the Retarded Van der Waals Force Abstract: The retarded Van der Waals force between a polarizable particle and a\nperfectly conducting plate is re-examined. The expression for this force given\nby Casimir and Polder represents a mean force, but there are large fluctuations\naround this mean value on short time scales which are of the same order of\nmagnitude as the mean force itself. However, these fluctuations occur on time\nscales which are typically of the order of the light travel time between the\natom and the plate. As a consequence, they will not be observed in an\nexperiment which measures the force averaged over a much longer time. In the\nlarge time limit, the magnitude of the mean squared velocity of a test particle\ndue to this fluctuating Van der Waals force approaches a constant, and is\nsimilar to a Brownian motion of a test particle in an thermal bath with an\neffective temperature. However the fluctuations are not isotropic in this case,\nand the shift in the mean square velocity components can even be negative. We\ninterpret this negative shift to correspond to a reduction in the velocity\nspread of a wavepacket. The force fluctuations discussed in this paper are\nspecial case of the more general problem of stress tensor fluctuations. These\nare of interest in a variety of areas fo physics, including gravity theory.\nThus the effects of Van der Waals force fluctuations serve as a useful model\nfor better understanding quantum effects in gravity theory. \n\n"}
{"id": "quant-ph/0204088", "contents": "Title: The Wave Function: It or Bit? Abstract: Schroedinger's wave function shows many aspects of a state of incomplete\nknowledge or information (\"bit\"): (1) it is usually defined on a space of\nclassical configurations, (2) its generic entanglement is, therefore, analogous\nto statistical correlations, and (3) it determines probabilities of measurement\noutcomes. Nonetheless, quantum superpositions (such as represented by a wave\nfunction) define individual physical states (\"it\"). This conceptual dilemma may\nhave its origin in the conventional operational foundation of physical\nconcepts, successful in classical physics, but inappropriate in quantum theory\nbecause of the existence of mutually exclusive operations (used for the\ndefinition of concepts). In contrast, a hypothetical realism, based on concepts\nthat are justified only by their universal and consistent applicability, favors\nthe wave function as a description of (thus nonlocal) physical reality. The\n(conceptually local) classical world then appears as an illusion, facilitated\nby the phenomenon of decoherence, which is consistently explained by the very\nentanglement that must dynamically arise in a universal wave function. \n\n"}

Abstract: We consider the hypothesis that quantum mechanics is an approximation to\nanother, cosmological theory, accurate only for the description of subsystems\nof the universe. Quantum theory is then to be derived from the cosmological\ntheory by averaging over variables which are not internal to the subsystem,\nwhich may be considered non-local hidden variables.

The key lesson is that\nthe effect of the coupling to the external degrees of freedom introduces noise\ninto the evolution of the system degrees of freedom, while preserving a notion\nof averaged conserved energy and time reversal invariance.\n  These conditions imply that the effective description of the subsystem is\nNelson's stochastic formulation of quantum theory.
