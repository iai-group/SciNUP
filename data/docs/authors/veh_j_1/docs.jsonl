The long range allows a Sommerfeld enhancement to boost the\nannihilation cross section as required, without altering the weak scale\nannihilation cross section during dark matter freezeout in the early universe.\nIf the dark matter annihilates into the new force carrier, phi, its low mass\ncan force it to decay dominantly into leptons. If the force carrier is a\nnon-Abelian gauge boson, the dark matter is part of a multiplet of states, and\nsplittings between these states are naturally generated with size alpha m_phi ~\nMeV, leading to the eXciting dark matter (XDM) scenario previously proposed to\nexplain the positron annihilation in the galactic center observed by the\nINTEGRAL satellite.

We investigate whether or not\nthese stars could have been as important in death as sources of energetic X-ray\nphotons as they were during their main sequence lives. Most massive stars are\nexpected to form in binaries, and an appreciable fraction of these (as much as\n~30%) will evolve into X-ray luminous (L_X~10^38 erg/s) high-mass X-ray\nbinaries (HMXBs). These sources would have made a contribution to the X-ray\nbackground at z>~6. Using Monte Carlo models of a globular cluster, we estimate\nthe total X-ray luminosity of a population of HMXBs. We compare and contrast\nthis with the total UV luminosity of the massive stars during their main\nsequence lives. For reasonable estimates, we find that the bolometric\nluminosity of the cluster peaks at ~10^42 erg/s during the first few million\nyears, but declines to ~10^41 erg/s after ~5 million years as the most massive\nstars evolve off the main sequence.

The\ntime-resolved spectra are fitted by a synchrotron model, where the observed\nspectrum is due to a exponentially cutoff power law distribution of electrons\nradiating in uniform magnetic field; this model is preferred over a broken\npower law. As another scenario, we separate the spectrum into \"steady\" and\n\"variable\" components by subtracting the spectrum in the lowest-flux period\nfrom those of other data segments.

The presence of a black hole may help, but is not strictly required,\nsince neutron star X-ray binaries and dwarf novae can be powerful jet sources\nas well. The above issues are broadly discussed throughout this Chapter, with a\na rather trivial question in mind: why do we care?

This break can naturally be explained in\nthe \"perturbation propagation\" model, which assumes that at any given radius in\nthe accretion disk stochastic perturbations are introduced to the flow with\nfrequencies characteristic for this radius. These perturbations are then\nadvected to the region of main energy release leading to a self-similar\nvariability of X-ray flux P~f^{-1...-1.5}. The break in the PDS is then a\nnatural manifestation of the transition from the disk to magnetospheric flow at\nthe frequency characteristic for the accretion disk truncation radius\n(magnetospheric radius).

The source was observed in V, R and i-bands\nusing the Faulkes Telescopes North and South. The light curve is dominated by\nlong-term variations which are correlated (at the > 3 sigma level) with the\nRXTE ASM soft X-ray flux. The variations span one magnitude in all three\nfilters. We find no evidence for periodicities in our light curves, contrary to\na previous short-timescale optical study in which the flux varied on a 9.3-hour\nsinusoidal period by a smaller amplitude. The optical spectral energy\ndistribution is blue and typical of LMXBs in outburst, as is the power law\nindex of the correlation beta = 0.5, where F_{nu,OPT} propto F_X^beta. The\ndiscrete cross-correlation function reveals a peak at an X-ray lag of 2 - 14\ndays, which could be the viscous timescale. However, adopting the least squares\nmethod the strongest correlation is at a lag of 0 +/- 4 days, consistent with\nX-ray reprocessing on the surface of the disc. We therefore constrain the\noptical lag behind X-ray to be between -14 and +4 days. In addition, we use the\noptical - X-ray luminosity diagram for LMXBs as a diagnostic tool to constrain\nthe nature of the compact object in 4U 1957+11, since black hole (BH) and\nneutron star (NS) sources reside in different regions of this diagram.

The basic features we require for\nsuccessful models are (i) significant hard X-ray emission whose luminosity\nexceeds that of soft X-rays, (ii) high hard X-ray luminosities in the range of\n(0.4 - 30) times 10^{37} erg s^{-1}, and (iii) the existence of two power-law\ncomponents in the hard X-ray band with the photon indices of Gamma_s ~ 2 >\nGamma_h, where Gamma_s and Gamma_h are the photon indices of the softer (<10\nkeV) and the harder (>10 keV) power-law components, respectively.

However,\nflares and prompt pulses differ in one crucial aspect: flares evolve with time.\nAs time proceeds flares become wider, with larger peak lag, lower luminosities\nand softer emission. The flare spectral peak energy E_{p,i} evolves to lower\nvalues following an exponential decay which tracks the decay of the flare flux.\nThe two flares with best statistics show higher than expected isotropic energy\nE_{iso} and peak luminosity L_{p,iso} when compared to the E_{p,i}-E_{iso} and\nE_{p,i}-L_{iso} prompt correlations. E_{p,i} is found to correlate with L_{iso}\nwithin single flares, giving rise to a time resolved E_{p,i}(t)-L_{iso}(t).\nLike prompt pulses, flares define a lag-luminosity relation: L_{p,iso}^{0.3-10\nkeV} t_{lag}^{-0.95+/-0.23}. The lag-luminosity is proven to be a fundamental\nlaw extending 5 decades in time and 5 in energy.

The flat or\ninverted spectrum covers the whole radio band and has been established also at\nmillimeter and infrared wavelengths. When this kind of radio emission is\nspatially resolved it appears as a continuous jet, the so-called \"steady jet\".\nIn contrast, transient jets associated with optically thin events are resolved\nas \"plasmoids\" moving at relativistic speeds away from the center of the\nsystem.

In this work we study its spectral and timing\nproperties during the 2009 outburst based on Swift and RXTE data. Our spectral\nanalysis of the source indicates only slight spectral shape evolution during\nthe entire outburst. The equivalent width of the iron line and the apparent\narea of the blackbody emission associated with the hotspot at the stellar\nsurface both decrease significantly during the outburst. This is consistent\nwith a gradual receding of the accretion disc as the accretion rate drops. The\npulse profile analysis shows absence of dramatic shape evolution with a\nmoderate decrease in pulse amplitude. This behaviour might result from a\nmovement of the accretion column footprint towards the magnetic pole as the\ndisc retreats. The time lag between the soft and the hard energy pulses\nincrease by a factor of two during the outburst. A physical displacement of the\ncentroid of the accretion shock relative to the blackbody spot or changes in\nthe emissivity pattern of the Comptonization component related to the\nvariations of the accretion column structure could cause this evolution.

The optical prompt emission was detected by\nSwift/UVOT, ROTSE-IIIb and BOOTES telescopes when the GRB was still radiating\nin the gamma-ray band. Nearly 200 s of observations were obtained\nsimultaneously from optical, X-ray to gamma-ray, which makes it one of the\nexceptional cases to study the broadband spectral energy distribution across 6\norders of magnitude in energy during the prompt emission phase. By fitting the\ntime resolved prompt spectra, we clearly identify, for the first time, an\ninteresting two-break energy spectrum, roughly consistent with the standard GRB\nsynchrotron emission model in the fast cooling regime. Although the prompt\noptical emission is brighter than the extrapolation of the best fit X/gamma-ray\nspectra, it traces the gamma-ray light curve shape, suggesting a relation to\nthe prompt high energy emission. The synchrotron + SSC scenario is disfavored\nby the data, but the models invoking a pair of internal shocks or having two\nemission regions can interpret the data well.

A number of the more\nrecent detections, including PSR J0034-0534, PSR J1939+2134 (B1937+21; the\nfirst MSP ever discovered), PSR J1959+2048 (B1957+20; the first black widow\nsystem), and PSR J2214+3000 exhibit an unusual phenomenon: nearly phase-aligned\nradio and gamma-ray light curves (LCs). To account for the phase alignment, we\nexplore geometric models where both the radio and gamma-ray emission originate\neither in the outer magnetosphere near the light cylinder (R_LC) or near the\npolar caps (PCs). We obtain reasonable fits for the first three of these MSPs\nin the context of \"altitude-limited\" outer gap (alOG) and two-pole caustic\n(alTPC) geometries. The outer magnetosphere phase-aligned models differ from\nthe standard outer gap (OG) / two-pole caustic (TPC) models in two respects:\nfirst, the radio emission originates in caustics at relatively high altitudes\ncompared to the usual low-altitude conal radio beams; second, we allow the\nmaximum altitude of the gamma-ray emission region as well as both the minimum\nand maximum altitudes of the radio emission region to vary within a limited\nrange. Alternatively, there also exist phase-aligned LC solutions for emission\noriginating near the stellar surface in a slot gap (SG) scenario (\"low-altitude\nslot gap\" (laSG) models). We find best-fit LCs using a Markov chain Monte Carlo\n(MCMC) maximum likelihood approach.

Abstract: We estimate the contribution to the extragalactic gamma-ray background (EGRB)\nfrom both intrinsic and cascade emissions produced by blazars using a simple\nsemi- analysis method for two models of the blazar gamma-ray luminosity\nfunction (GLF). For the cascade emission, we consider two possible\ncontributions: one is due to that the flux of the cascade emission is lower\nthan the Fermi LAT sensitivity (case I), which is independent on the\nextragalactic magnetic field (EGMF), another is due to the fact that the flux\nof the cascade emission is larger than the Fermi LAT sensitivity but the\nemission angle is larger than LAT point-spread-function (PSF) angle (case II),\nwhich depends on the EGMF. Our results indicate that (1) blazar contribution to\nthe EGRB is dominant although it depends on the GLF model and the EGMF; (2) the\nEGMF plays an important role in estimating the contribution from the cascade\nemission produced by blazars, the contribution from the cascade emission will\nsignificantly alter the EGRB spectrum when the strength of the EGMF is large\nenough (say BEGMF > 10-12 G); and (3) since the cascade emission in case II\nreaches a saturation when the strength of the EGMF is ? 10-11 G, it is very\npossible that the contribution from the cascade emission produced by blazars\ncan be considered as another method to probe the upper limit of the strength of\nthe EGMF. \n\n"}

The observed 0.5-2 keV band luminosity of\nthe diffuse X-ray emission within the D_25 ellipse is L_0.5-2keV = 2.7 x 10^39\nerg/s. The hot gas has a significantly broader distribution than the stellar\nlight, and shows strong hydrodynamic disturbances with a sharp surface\nbrightness edge to the northeast and a trailing tail. We identify the edge as a\ncold front and conclude that the distorted morphology of the hot gas is\nproduced by ram pressure as NGC4342 moves through external gas. From the\nthermal pressure ratios inside and outside the cold front, we estimate the\nvelocity of NGC4342 and find that it moves supersonically (M~2.6) towards the\nnortheast.

We review the recent observational results on the hot gas in galaxy\ngroups. The first part of the paper is on the scaling relations, including\nX-ray luminosity, entropy, gas fraction, baryon fraction and metal abundance.\nCompared to clusters, groups have a lower fraction of hot gas around the center\n(e.g., r < r_2500), but may have a comparable gas fraction at large radii\n(e.g., r_2500 < r < r_500). Better constraints on the group gas and baryon\nfractions require sample studies with different selection functions and deep\nobservations at r > r_500 regions. The hot gas in groups is also iron poor at\nlarge radii (0.3 r_500 - 0.7 r_500). The iron content of the hot gas within the\ncentral regions (r < 0.3 r_500) correlates with the group mass, in contrast to\nthe trend of the stellar mass fraction.

Its lightcurves in both the prompt and afterglow phases are\nsimilar to GRB 060614, a nearby long GRB without an associated SN. We analyze\nthe observational data of this event and discuss the possible origins of its\nmulti-wavelength emission. We show that its joint lightcurve at 1 keV derived\nfrom Swift BAT and XRT observations is composed of two distinguished\ncomponents. The first component, whose spectrum is extremely soft (\\Gamma =\n4.32), ends with a steep decay segment, indicating the internal origin of this\ncomponent. The second component is a slowly-rising, broad bump which peaks at\n~10^5 seconds post the BAT trigger. Assuming that the late bump is due to onset\nof the afterglow, we derive the initial Lorentz factor (Gamma_0) of the GRB\nfireball and find that it significantly deviates from the relation between the\nGamma_0 and Eiso of typical GRBs. We also check whether it follows the same\nanti-correlation between X-ray luminosity and the break time observed in the\nshallow decay phase of many typical GRBs, which is usually regarded as a signal\nof late energy injection from the GRB central engine. However, we find that it\ndoes not obey this correlation. We propose that the late bump could be\ncontributed by a two-component jet.

We also present, for\nthe first time, the modeling of the synchrotron emission as seen by an external\nobserver during the reconnection process. The expected lightcurves comprise\nseveral bright symmetric sub-flares emitted by the energetic beam of particles\nsweeping across the line of sight intermittently, and exhibit super-fast time\nvariability as short as about one tenth of the system light-crossing time. The\nconcentration of the energetic particles into compact regions inside magnetic\nislands and particle anisotropy explain the rapid variability. This radiative\nsignature of reconnection can account for the brightness and variability of the\ngamma-ray flares in the Crab Nebula and in blazars. \n\n"}

For the stellar core collapse simulation, we present the\nlatest numerical results. We employed a purely nucleonic EOS (Shen-EOS). As an\ninitial condition, we adopted a 100 $M_{\\odot}$ presupernova model calculated\nby Umeda and Nomoto. Changing the degree of rotation for the initial condition,\nwe clarify the strong dependence of the outcome of the collapse on this. When\nthe rotation is rapid enough, the shock wave formed at the core bounce is\ndeformed to be a torus-like shape. Then, the infalling matter is accumulated in\nthe central region due to the oblique shock at the torus surface, hitting the\nPNS and dissipating the kinetic energy there. As a result, outflows can be\nlaunched. The PNS eventually collapses to a BH and an accretion torus is formed\naround it. We also found that the evolution of the BH and torus depends\nstrongly on the rotation initially given. In the BNS merger simulations, we in\naddition employ an EOS incorporating a degree of freedom for hyperons.

We\npresent some characteristic examples of the temporal behaviour of the system\nand show that this can be very different from the one exhibited by leptonic\nmodels. Furthermore, we argue that, contrary to the wide-held belief, there are\nparameter regimes where the hadronic models can become quite efficient.\nHowever, to keep the free parameters at a minimum and facilitate an in-depth\nstudy of the system, we have only concentrated on the case where protons are\ninjected; i.e., we did not consider the effects of a co-accelerated leptonic\ncomponent. \n\n"}

Recent rich\nobservations of GRBs by space missions such as Swift and Fermi pose new\nconstraints on GRB central engine models. In this paper, we study the baryon\nloading processes of a GRB jet launched from a black hole central engine. We\nconsider a relativistic jet powered by $\\nu \\bar\\nu$-annihilation or by the\nBlandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanism. We consider baryon loading from a\nneutrino-driven wind from a neutrino-cooling-dominated accretion flow. For a\nmagnetically dominated BZ jet, we consider neutron-drifting from the magnetic\nwall surrounding the jet and subsequent positron capture and proton-neutron\ninelastic collisions. The minumim baryon loads in both types of jet are\ncalculated. We find that in both cases, a more luminous jet tends to be more\nbaryon poor.

Both models have the right scaling to interpret the empirical\n$\\Gamma-L_{\\rm iso}$ relation discovered recently.

If the injection fraction of cosmic-ray (CR)\nparticles is greater than 2x10^{-4}, for the shock parameters relevant for\nyoung supernova remnants, DSA is efficient enough to develop a significant\nshock precursor due to CR feedback, and magnetic field can be amplified up to a\nfactor of 20 via CR streaming instability in the upstream region. If scattering\ncenters drift with Alfven speed in the amplified magnetic field, the CR energy\nspectrum can be steepened significantly and the acceleration efficiency is\nreduced. Nonlinear DSA with self-consistent MFA and Alfvenic drift predicts\nthat the postshock CR pressure saturates roughly at 10 % of the shock ram\npressure for strong shocks with a sonic Mach number ranging 20< M_s< 100. Since\nthe amplified magnetic field follows the flow modification in the precursor,\nthe low energy end of the particle spectrum is softened much more than the high\nenergy end. As a result, the concave curvature in the energy spectra does not\ndisappear entirely even with the help of Alfvenic drift. For shocks with a\nmoderate Alfven Mach number (M_A<10), the accelerated CR spectrum can become as\nsteep as E^{-2.1}-E^{-2.3}, which is more consistent with the observed CR\nspectrum and gamma-ray photon spectrum of several young supernova remnants. \n\n"}

The detection of non-thermal emission from SNRs\ndemonstrates the presence of energetic particles, but direct signatures of\nprotons and other ions remain elusive. If these particles receive a sizeable\nfraction of the explosion energy, the morphological and spectral evolution of\nthe SNR must be modified. To assess this, we run 3D hydrodynamic simulations of\na remnant coupled with a non-linear acceleration model. We obtain the\ntime-dependent evolution of the shocked structure, impacted by the\nRayleigh-Taylor hydrodynamic instabilities at the contact discontinuity and by\nthe back-reaction of particles at the forward shock. We then compute the\nprogressive temperature equilibration and non-equilibrium ionization state of\nthe plasma, and its thermal emission in each cell. This allows us to produce\nthe first realistic synthetic maps of the projected X-ray emission from the\nSNR. Plasma conditions (temperature, ionization age) can vary widely over the\nprojected surface of the SNR, especially between the ejecta and the ambient\nmedium owing to their different composition. This demonstrates the need for\nspatially-resolved spectroscopy. We find that the integrated emission is\nreduced with particle back-reaction, with the effect being more significant for\nthe highest photon energies. Therefore different energy bands, corresponding to\ndifferent emitting elements, probe different levels of the impact of particle\nacceleration.

In the outer gap model, most pairs inside the gap\nare created around the null charge surface and the gap's electric field\nseparates the two charges to move in opposite directions. Consequently, the\nregion from the null charge surface to the light cylinder is dominated by the\noutflow current while that from the null charge surface to the star is\ndominated by the inflow current. We suggest that the viewing angle of PSR\nB1509-58 only receives the inflow radiation. The incoming curvature photons are\nconverted to pairs by the strong magnetic field of the star. The X-rays and\nsoft gamma-rays of PSR B1509-58 result from the synchrotron radiation of these\npairs.

While all relativistic jet models display anti-beaming of GW\nradiation away from the jet axis, thus radiating away from directions of GRBs'\ngamma radiation, this effect is not overwhelming. The decrease of the signal\namplitude towards the cone of gamma-ray detectability is weak, and for some\nmodels and parameters the GW signal reaches a significant amplitude for much of\nthe gamma-ray cone. Thus both signals may be jointly detected. We find\ndifferent waveforms and fourier signatures for uniform jets and structured jet\nmodels - thus offering a method of using GW signatures to probe the internal\nstructure and acceleration of GRB jets. The GW signal peaks just outside the\njet (core) of a uniform (structuted) jet.

Hydrodynamical models show that the cooling\nof a shocked Wolf-Rayet star leads to a much greater difference (> 0.9 dex).\nOur proposed scenario is that of a jet produced during the explosion which\ndeposits 56Ni-rich material in the outer layers of the ejecta. The presence of\nhigh-velocity radioactive material allows us to reproduce the complete\nluminosity evolution of the object. Without outer 56Ni it could be possible to\nreproduce the early emission purely from cooling of the shocked envelope by\nassuming a larger progenitor than a Wolf-Rayet star, but that would require an\ninitial density structure significantly different from what is predicted by\nstellar evolution models.

We show images and profiles of spectral index over\nthe frequency range 1.4 - 8.5 GHz, together with values integrated over\nfiducial regions defined by our relativistic models of the jets. We find that\nthe spectral index decreases (the spectrum flattens) with distance from the\nnucleus in all of the jets. The mean spectral indices are 0.66 +/- 0.01 where\nthe jets first brighten abruptly and 0.59 +/- 0.01 after they recollimate. The\nmean change in spectral index between these locations, which is independent of\ncalibration and flux-density scale errors and is therefore more accurately and\nrobustly measured, is -0.067 +/- 0.006. Our jet models associate the decrease\nin spectral index with a bulk deceleration of the flow from 0.8c to <0.5c.

One possible acceleration mechanism is the\nfirst-order Fermi process in mildly relativistic shocks: in the Bohm limit, the\nindex of the electron energy spectrum, p, is slightly larger than 2 and\ndecreases with velocity upstream of the shock. This possibility is consistent\nwith our measurements, but requires shocks throughout the jet volume rather\nthan at a few discrete locations.

In this paper, we study the\nlarge-scale diffuse X-ray emission associated with the massive spiral galaxy\nNGC266.

Although\nthe origin of the hardening is not clearly understood, possible explanations\ninclude hardening in the cosmic-ray source spectrum, changes in the cosmic-ray\npropagation properties in the Galaxy and the effect of nearby sources. In this\ncontribution, we propose that the spectral anomaly might be an effect of\nre-acceleration of cosmic rays by weak shocks in the Galaxy. After acceleration\nby strong supernova remnant shock waves, cosmic rays undergo diffusive\npropagation through the Galaxy. During the propagation, cosmic rays may again\nencounter expanding supernova remnant shock waves, and get re-accelerated. As\nthe probability of encountering old supernova remnants is expected to be larger\nthan the young ones due to their bigger size, re-acceleration is expected to be\nproduced mainly by weaker shocks. Since weaker shocks generate a softer\nparticle spectrum, the resulting re-accelerated component will have a spectrum\nsteeper than the initial cosmic-ray source spectrum produced by strong shocks.\nFor a reasonable set of model parameters, it is shown that such re-accelerated\ncomponent can dominate the GeV energy region while the non-reaccelerated\ncomponent dominates at higher energies, explaining the observed GeV-TeV\nspectral anomaly. \n\n"}

Cold accretion flows, which consist of cool optically thick gas, are found\nat relatively high mass accretion rates. Prominent examples are the standard\nthin disk, which occurs at a fraction of the Eddington mass accretion rate, and\nthe slim disk at super-Eddington rates. These accretion flows are responsible\nfor luminous systems such as active galactic nuclei radiating at or close to\nthe Eddington luminosity and black hole X-ray binaries in the soft state. Hot\naccretion flows, the topic of this review, are virially hot and optically thin.\nThey occur at lower mass accretion rates, and are described by models such as\nthe advection-dominated accretion flow and luminous hot accretion flow. Because\nof energy advection, the radiative efficiency of these flows is in general\nlower than that of a standard thin accretion disk. Moreover, the efficiency\ndecreases with decreasing mass accretion rate. Observations show that hot\naccretion flows are associated with jets. In addition, theoretical arguments\nsuggest that hot flows should produce strong winds.

Most of the\ndispersion would then occur in the overlying stellar coronae.

Super-AGB stars are expected to\nhave slow winds with high mass-loss rates, so their wind density is high. The\nexplosions of super-AGB stars are therefore presumed to occur in this dense\nwind. We provide the first synthetic light curves (LCs) for such events by\nexploding realistic electron-capture supernova (ecSN) progenitors within their\nsuper-AGB winds. We find that the early LC, i.e. before the recombination wave\nreaches the bottom of the H-rich envelope of SN ejecta (the plateau phase), is\nnot affected by the dense wind. However, after the plateau phase, the\nluminosity remains higher when the super-AGB wind is taken into account. We\ncompare our results to the historical LC of SN 1054, the progenitor of the Crab\nNebula, and show that the explosion of an ecSN within an ordinary super-AGB\nwind can explain the LC features. We conclude that SN 1054 could have been a\nType IIn SN without any extra extreme mass loss which was previously suggested\nto be necessary to account for its early high luminosity. We also show that our\nLCs match Type IIn SNe with an early plateau phase (`Type IIn-P') and suggest\nthat they are ecSNe within super-AGB winds. Although some ecSNe can be bright\nin the optical spectral range due to the large progenitor radius, their X-ray\nluminosity from the interaction does not necessarily get as bright as other\nType IIn SNe whose optical luminosities are also powered by the interaction.\nThus, we suggest that optically-bright X-ray-faint Type IIn SNe can emerge from\necSNe. Optically-faint Type IIn SNe, such as SN 2008S, can also originate from\necSNe if their H-rich envelope masses are small.

We present two-dimensional axisymmetric\nhydrodynamical simulations which start from a collapsar engine and evolve all\nthe way through the late afterglow phase. The resultant outflow includes a jet\ncore which is highly relativistic after breaking out of the star, but becomes\nbaryon-loaded after colliding with a massive outer shell, corresponding to mass\nfrom the stellar atmosphere of the progenitor star which became trapped in\nfront of the jet core at breakout. The prompt emission produced before or\nduring this collision would then have the signature of a high Lorentz factor\njet, but the afterglow is produced by the amalgamated post-collision ejecta\nwhich has more inertia than the original highly relativistic jet core and thus\nhas a delayed deceleration. This naturally explains the early light curve\nbehavior discovered by Swift, including a steep decay and a long plateau,\nwithout invoking late-time energy injection from the central engine.

We\ndescribe here a new method using time-delay lensed quasars where one or several\nimages are affected by microlensing due to stars in the lensing galaxy. Because\nmicrolensing decreases (or increases) the flux of the continuum compared to the\nbroad line region, it changes the contrast between these two emission\ncomponents. We show that this effect can be used to effectively disentangle the\nintrinsic variability of those two regions, offering the opportunity to perform\nreverberation mapping based on single band photometric data.

Our goal is to\ncharacterize in detail the source gamma-ray emission, together with the\nradio-to-X-ray emission, during the non-flaring (low) activity, which is less\noften studied than the occasional flaring (high) activity. We organized a\nmultiwavelength (MW) campaign on Mrk 501 between March and May 2008. This\nmulti-instrument effort included the most sensitive VHE gamma-ray instruments\nin the northern hemisphere, namely the imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes\nMAGIC and VERITAS, as well as Swift, RXTE, the F-GAMMA, GASP-WEBT, and other\ncollaborations and instruments. Mrk 501 was found to be in a low state of\nactivity during the campaign, with a VHE flux in the range of 10%-20% of the\nCrab nebula flux. Nevertheless, significant flux variations were detected with\nvarious instruments, with a trend of increasing variability with energy. The\nbroadband spectral energy distribution during the two different emission states\nof the campaign can be adequately described within the homogeneous one-zone\nsynchrotron self-Compton model, with the (slightly) higher state described by\nan increase in the electron number density. This agrees with previous studies\nof the broadband emission of this source during flaring and non-flaring states.\nWe report for the first time a tentative X-ray-to-VHE correlation during a low\nVHE activity. Although marginally significant, this positive correlation\nbetween X-ray and VHE, which has been reported many times during flaring\nactivity, suggests that the mechanisms that dominate the X-ray/VHE emission\nduring non-flaring-activity are not substantially different from those that are\nresponsible for the emission during flaring activity. \n\n"}

It has been suggested that\nmultiple scatterings of SN photons by CS dust may explain the non-standard\nreddening law. In this paper, we examine the effect of re-emission of SN\nphotons by CS dust in the infrared (IR) wavelength regime. This effect allows\nthe observed IR light curves to be used as a constraint on the position/size\nand the amount of CS dust. The method was applied to observed near-infrared\n(NIR) SN Ia samples; meaningful upper limits on the CS dust mass were derived\neven under conservative assumptions. We thereby clarify a difficulty associated\nwith the CS dust scattering model as a general explanation for the peculiar\nreddening law, while it may still apply to a sub-sample of highly reddened SNe\nIa.

In this paper, we continue our study by investigating the\ndetailed properties of wind, such as mass flux and poloidal speed, and the\nmechanism of wind production. For this aim, we make use of a three dimensional\nGRMHD simulation of hot accretion flows around a Schwarzschild black hole. The\nsimulation is designed so that the magnetic flux is not accumulated\nsignificantly around the black hole. To distinguish real wind from turbulent\noutflows, we track the trajectories of the virtual Largrangian particles from\nsimulation data. We find two types of real outflows, i.e., a quasi-relativistic\njet close to the axis and a sub-relativistic wind subtending a much larger\nsolid angle. Most of the wind originates from the surface layer of the\naccretion flow. The poloidal wind speed almost remains constant once they are\nproduced, but the flux-weighted wind speed roughly follows $v_{\\rm p,\nwind}(r)\\approx 0.25 v_k(r)$. The mass flux of jet is much lower but the speed\nis much higher, $v_{\\rm p,jet}\\sim (0.3-0.4) c$.

Transverse\nmomentum spectra of baryons from RHIC ($\\sqrt(s)$=62 and 200 GeV) and from LHC\n($\\sqrt(s)$=0.9 and 7 TeV) have been considered. It is seen that the slope of\ndistributions at low $p_T$'s is changing with energy. The QGSM fit of these\nspectra gives the average transverse momenta which behave as $s^{0.06}$ that is\nsimilar to the previously observed behavior of $\\Lambda^0$ hyperon spectra. The\nchange in average transverse momenta that are slowly growing in VHE hadron\ninteractions at CR detectors cannot cause the \"knee\" in measured cosmic ray\nproton spectra. In addition, the available data on heavy quark hadron\nproduction from LHC-b at $\\sqrt{s}$=7 TeV were also studied. The preliminary\ndependence of hadron average transverse momenta on their masses at LHC energy\nis presented. The possible source of cosmic ray antiparticle-to-particle ratios\nthat are growing with energy was analyzed in the framework of QGSM, where the\ngrowing ratios are the result of local leading asymmetry between the production\nspectra of baryons and antibaryons in the kinematical region of proton target\nfragmentation.

We assume that the energy for\nre-acceleration in the halo is supplied by shocks generated by processes of\nstar accretion onto the central black hole. Numerical simulations show that\nregions with strong turbulence (places for electron re-acceleration) are\nlocated high up in the Galactic Halo about several kpc above the disk. The\nenergy of SNR electrons that reach these regions does not exceed several GeV\nbecause of synchrotron and inverse Compton energy losses.

It is timely to stress, however, that the\nconclusions obtained crucially depend on the framework in which the data are\ninterpreted as well as from some nuclear input parameters. We aim at assessing\nthe theoretical uncertainties affecting the outcome, with models as simple as\npossible while still retaining the key dependencies. We compare different\nsemi-analytical, two-zone model descriptions of cosmic-ray transport in the\nGalaxy. We test for the effect of a primary source contamination in the boron\nflux by parametrically altering its flux, as well as for nuclear cross section\nuncertainties.

Thus, hadron-initiated showers\ndetected by both type of detectors are used to calibrate the energy estimator\nfrom the surface array (usually the interpolated signal at a certain distance\nfrom the shower core S(r0)) with the primary energy. On the other hand, this\ncalibration is not feasible when searching for photon primaries since no high\nenergy photon has been unambiguously detected so far. Therefore, pure Monte\nCarlo parametrizations are used instead.\n  In this work, we present a new method to determine the primary energy of\nhadron-induced showers in a hybrid experiment based on a technique previously\ndeveloped for photon primaries.

Such a BH-torus system can be formed in compact binary\nmergers and is able to launch a relativistic jet, which can then produce the\nSGRB. This basic scenario, however, has recently been challenged by Swift\nsatellite observations, which have revealed long-lasting X-ray afterglows in\nassociation with a large fraction of SGRB events.

Some circumstellar-interacting (CSI) supernovae (SNe) are produced\nby the explosions of massive stars that have lost mass shortly before the SN\nexplosion. There is evidence that the precursors of some SNe IIn were luminous\nblue variable (LBV) stars. For a small number of CSI SNe, outbursts have been\nobserved before the SN explosion. Eruptive events of massive stars are named as\nSN impostors (SN IMs) and whether they herald a forthcoming SN or not is still\nunclear. The large variety of observational properties of CSI SNe suggests the\nexistence of other progenitors, such as red supergiant (RSG) stars with\nsuperwinds. Furthermore, the role of metallicity in the mass loss of CSI SN\nprogenitors is still largely unexplored. Aims. Our goal is to gain insight on\nthe nature of the progenitor stars of CSI SNe by studying their environments,\nin particular the metallicity at their locations. Methods. We obtain\nmetallicity measurements at the location of 60 transients (including SNe IIn,\nSNe Ibn, and SN IMs), via emission-line diagnostic on optical spectra obtained\nat the Nordic Optical Telescope and through public archives. Metallicity values\nfrom the literature complement our sample. We compare the metallicity\ndistributions among the different CSI SN subtypes and to those of other\ncore-collapse SN types. We also search for possible correlations between\nmetallicity and CSI SN observational properties. Results. We find that SN IMs\ntend to occur in environments with lower metallicity than those of SNe IIn.\nAmong SNe IIn, SN IIn-L(1998S-like) SNe show higher metallicities, similar to\nthose of SNe IIL/P, whereas long-lasting SNe IIn (1988Z-like) show lower\nmetallicities, similar to those of SN IMs. The metallicity distribution of SNe\nIIn can be reproduced by combining the metallicity distributions of SN IMs\n(that may be produced by major outbursts of massive stars like LBVs) and SNe\nIIP (produced by RSGs). The same applies to the distributions of the Normalized\nCumulative Rank (NCR) values, which quantifies the SN association to H II\nregions. For SNe IIn, we find larger mass-loss rates and higher CSM velocities\nat higher metallicities. The luminosity increment in the optical bands during\nSN IM outbursts tend to be larger at higher metallicity, whereas the SN IM\nquiescent optical luminosities tend to be lower. Conclusions. The difference in\nmetallicity between SNe IIn and SN IMs suggests that LBVs are only one of the\nprogenitor channels for SNe IIn, with 1988Z-like and 1998S-like SNe possibly\narising from LBVs and RSGs, respectively. Finally, even though linedriven winds\nlikely do not primarily drive the late mass-loss of CSI SN progenitors,\nmetallicity has some impact on the observational properties of these\ntransients.

We track the\nevolution of these spectra as the source makes a transition from a bright\nlow/hard to hard intermediate state. In the hard/intermediate states, the QPO\nand time averaged spectra are similar and the harmonic is either undetected or\nsimilar to the QPO. By contrast, in the softer states the harmonic is\ndramatically softer than the QPO spectrum and the time averaged spectrum, and\nthe QPO spectrum is dramatically harder than the time averaged spectrum.\nClearly, the existance of these very different spectral shaped components mean\nthat the time-averaged spectra are complex. We use the frequency resolved\nspectra to better constrain the model components, and find that the data are\nconsistent with a time-averaged spectrum which has an additional low\ntemperature, optically thick Comptonisation component. The harmonic can be\ndescribed by this additional component alone, while the QPO spectrum is similar\nto that of the hard Comptonisation and its reflection. Neither QPO nor harmonic\nshow signs of the disc component even when it is strong in the time averaged\nspectrum. While the similarity between the harmonic and QPO spectra in the\nintermediate state can be produced from the angular dependence of Compton\nscattering in a single region, this cannot explain the dramatic differences\nseen in the soft state.

We use\ndifferent non-thermal models to study the different regions, and we compare our\nresults with the available observations in the radio, X-ray and gamma-ray\nbands, and the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect data.

In this scenario there are however some open\nissues, like the difficulty to explain the observed flux at 8.8 GHz, the high\nvalue of the required annihilation cross section, and the lack of observed\nemission coming from the minor DM subhalo. We also find that part of the radio\nemission originated by DM annihilation could be associated with a slightly\nextended radio source present near the main DM subhalo.

One such set of relations determines all of the multipole moments of a\nneutron star just from the first three (the mass monopole, the current dipole\nand the mass quadrupole moment) approximately independently of the equation of\nstate.

It is generally accepted that these jets are powered\nelectromagnetically, by the magnetised rotation of a central compact object.\nHowever, how they produce the observed emission and survive the propagation for\nmany orders of magnitude in distance without being disrupted by current-driven\nnon-axisymmetric instabilities is the subject of active debate. We carry out\ntime-dependent 3D relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of relativistic,\nPoynting flux dominated jets. The jets are launched self-consistently by the\nrotation of a strongly magnetised central compact object. This determines the\nnatural degree of azimuthal magnetic field winding, a crucial factor that\ncontrols jet stability. We find that the jets are susceptible to two types of\ninstability: (i) a global, external kink mode that grows on long time scales\nand causes the jets to bodily bend sideways. Whereas this mode does not cause\njet disruption over the simulated distances, it substantially reduces jet\npropagation speed. We show, via an analytic model, that the growth of the\nexternal kink mode depends on the slope of the ambient medium density profile.\nIn flat density distributions characteristic of galactic cores, an AGN jet may\nstall, whereas in stellar envelopes the external kink weakens as the jet\npropagates outward; (ii) a local, internal kink mode that grows over short time\nscales and causes small-angle magnetic reconnection and conversion of about\nhalf of jet electromagnetic energy flux into heat. Based on the robustness and\nenergetics of the internal kink mode, we suggest that this instability is the\nmain dissipation mechanism responsible for powering GRB prompt emission. \n\n"}

The jets that are launched by the accreting NS or black\nhole (BH) maintain their axis due to a rapidly rotating pre-collapse core, and\ndo not manage to eject core material from near the equatorial plane. The jets\nare able to eject material from the core along the polar directions, and reduce\nthe gravity near the equatorial plane. The equatorial gas expands, and part of\nit falls back over a timescale of minutes to days to prolong the jets-launching\nepisode. According to the model for SESNe proposed in the present paper, the\nprincipal parameter that distinguishes between the different cases of CCSN\nexplosions, such as between normal CCSNe and SESNe, is the efficiency of the\njet-feedback mechanism. This efficiency in turn depends on the pre-collapse\ncore mass, envelope mass, core convection, and most of all on the angular\nmomentum profile in the core. One prediction of the inefficient jet-feedback\nmechanism for SESNe is the formation of a slow equatorial outflow in the\nexplosion. Typical velocity and mass of this outflow are estimated to be\napproximately 1000 km/s and greater than about 1 solar mass, respectively,\nthough quantitative values will have to be checked in future hydrodynamic\nsimulations. \n\n"}

In 2003 and 2004 it experienced two outbursts in X-rays. We present\nhere an analysis of the system bursting properties during these outbursts. We\nstudied the evolution of the 2003-2004 outbursts in soft X-rays using RXTE\n(2.5-12 keV; ASM), and in hard X-rays with INTEGRAL (17-80 keV, IBIS/ISGRI).\nUsing data from the JEM-X monitor onboard INTEGRAL we detected 61 Type-I X-ray\nbursts, and confirm that the source displayed a quasi-periodic burst recurrence\ntime of about 2.3 hours. We improve the characterization of the fuel\ncomposition, as well as the description of the typical burst durations and\nfluences. We estimate the average value of $\\alpha$ to be $49\\pm\\,3$. This\nvalue together with the observed burst profiles indicate a regime of a mixed\nHe/H runaway triggered by unstable helium ignition. In addition, we report the\ndetection of four series of double bursts, with burst recurrence times of\n$\\leq\\,20$ minutes. The measured recurrence time in double bursts is too short\nto allow the accretion of enough fresh material, necessary to trigger a Type-I\nX-ray burst. This suggests the presence of left-over, unburned material from\nthe preceding burst which gets ignited in a time scale of minutes. The energies\nand time scales of the secondary bursts suggest a lower fraction of hydrogen\ncompared to that estimated for the primary bursts. The persistent emission was\nroughly constant during the period when the Type I X-ray bursts were detected.\nWe derive an average accretion rate during our observations of\n$\\dot{m}\\sim\\,8\\,\\%\\,\\dot{m}_{Edd}$.

The standard blazar\nparadigm features a jet of relativistic magnetized plasma ejected from the\nneighborhood of a spinning and accreting super-massive black hole, close to the\nobserver direction. Two classes of blazars are distinguished from observations:\nthe flat-spectrum radio-quasar class (FSRQ) is characterized by strong external\nradiation fields, emission of broad optical lines, and dust tori. The BL Lac\nclass (from the name of one of its members, BL Lacertae) corresponds to weaker\nadvection-dominated flows with gamma-ray spectra dominated by the inverse\nCompton effect on synchrotron photons.

We also investigate the role of\nsubhalos on the search for DM annihilation. Previous work has shown that\nsubhalos are expected to boost the DM signal of their host halos significantly.\nYet, these works traditionally assumed that subhalos exhibit similar structural\nproperties than those of field halos, while it is known that subhalos are more\nconcentrated.

We use the detected nebular emission lines to measure the\ndust extinction, star formation rate (SFR) and nebular metallicity (Z) of the\nhosts and supplement the data set with previously measured stellar masses\nM$_{\\star}$. The distributions of the obtained properties and their\ninterrelations (e.g. mass-metallicity and SFR-M$_{\\star}$ relations) are\ncompared to samples of field star-forming galaxies.We find that LGRB hosts at z\n< 1 have on average lower SFRs than if they were direct star-formation tracers.\nBy directly comparing metallicity distributions of LGRB hosts and star-forming\ngalaxies, we find a good match between the two populations up to Z $\\sim\n8.4-8.5$, after which the paucity of metal-rich LGRB hosts becomes apparent.\nThe LGRB host galaxies of our complete sample are not inconsistent with the\nmass-metallicity relation at similar mean redshift and stellar masses. The\ncutoff against high metallicities (and high masses) can explain the low SFR\nvalues of LGRB hosts. We find a hint of increased incidence of starburst\ngalaxies in the Swift/BAT6 z < 1 sample with respect to that of a field\nstar-forming population. Given that the SFRs are low on average, the latter is\nascribed to low stellar masses. Nevertheless the limits on the completeness and\nmetallicity availability of current surveys, coupled with the limited number of\nLGRB host galaxies, prevent us from reaching more quantitative conclusions. \n\n"}

The accelerated electrons are usually assumed to\nfollow a power law energy distribution with an index of $p$. Observationally,\nalthough most GRB afterglows have a $p$ larger than 2, there are still a few\nGRBs suggestive of a hard ($p<2$) electron spectrum. GRB 091127, with\nwell-sampled broad-band afterglow data, shows evidence of a hard electron\nspectrum and strong spectral evolution, with a spectral break moving from high\nto lower energies. The spectral break evolves very fast and cannot be explained\nby the cooling break in the standard afterglow model, unless evolving\nmicrophysical parameters are assumed. Besides, the multi-band afterglow light\ncurves show an achromatic break at around 33 ks.

This study focuses on the phenomenon of bi-drifting, an effect where\nthe drift direction of subpulses is systematically different in different pulse\nprofile components. Bi-drifting is extremely rare in the pulsar population.\nVarious tools in PSRSALSA, including those allowing quantification of\nperiodicities in the subpulse modulation, their flux distribution, and\npolarization properties, are exploited to obtain a comprehensive picture of the\nradio properties of PSR B1839-04. In particular, the second harmonic in the\nfluctuation spectra of the subpulse modulation is exploited to convincingly\ndemonstrate the existence of bi-drifting. Bi-drifting is confirmed with a\ncompletely independent method allowing the average modulation cycle to be\ndetermined. Polarization measurements were used to obtain a robust constraint\non the magnetic inclination angle of less than 35 deg. Two distinct emission\nmodes are discovered to be operating, with periodic subpulse modulation being\npresent only during the weaker mode. Despite the variability of the modulation\ncycle and interruption by mode-changes, the modulation pattern responsible for\nthe bi-drifting is strictly phase locked over a timescale of years such that\nthe variability is identical in the different components. The phase locking\nimplies that a single physical origin is responsible for both drift directions.\nPhase locking is hard to explain for many models, including those specifically\nproposed in the literature to explain bi-drifting, and they are therefore shown\nto be implausible. It is argued that within the framework of circulating\nbeamlets, bi-drifting could occur if the circulation were severely distorted,\npossibly by distortions in the magnetic field. \n\n"}

Abstract: Very massive stars in the final phases of their lives often show\nunpredictable outbursts that can mimic supernovae, so-called, \"SN impostors\",\nbut the distinction is not always straigthforward. Here we present observations\nof a luminous blue variable (LBV) in NGC 2770 in outburst over more than 20\nyears that experienced a possible terminal explosion as type IIn SN in 2015,\nnamed SN 2015bh. This possible SN or \"main event\" was preceded by a precursor\npeaking $\\sim$ 40 days before maximum. The total energy release of the main\nevent is $\\sim$1.8$\\times$10$^{49}$ erg, which can be modeled by a $<$ 0.5\nM$_\\odot$ shell plunging into a dense CSM. All emission lines show a single\nnarrow P-Cygni profile during the LBV phase and a double P-Cygni profile post\nmaximum suggesting an association of this second component with the possible\nSN. Since 1994 the star has been redder than during a typical S-Dor like\noutburst. SN 2015bh lies within a spiral arm of NGC 2770 next to a number of\nsmall star-forming regions with a metallicity of $\\sim$ 0.5 solar and a stellar\npopulation age of 7-10 Myr. SN 2015bh shares many similarities with SN 2009ip,\nwhich, together with other examples may form a new class of objects that\nexhibit outbursts a few decades prior to \"hyper-eruption\" or final\ncore-collapse. If the star survives this event it is undoubtedly altered, and\nwe suggest that these \"zombie stars\" may evolve from an LBV to a Wolf Rayet\nstar over a very short timescale of only a few years. The final fate of these\ntypes of massive stars can only be determined with observations years after the\npossible SN. \n\n"}

In this context, even the\nunlikely idea that astrophysical black holes may have significant charge is\nworth exploring, and here we present results from the simulation of weakly\ncharged black holes as they orbit and merge.

Within the fireshell model, S-GRBs exhibit three different\ncomponents: the P-GRB emission, observed at the transparency of a\nself-accelerating baryon-$e^+e^-$ plasma; the prompt emission, originating from\nthe interaction of the accelerated baryons with the circumburst medium; the\nhigh-energy (GeV) emission, observed after the P-GRB and indicating the\nformation of a BH.

Its P-GRB spectrum can be fitted by a\nconvolution of thermal spectra whose origin can be traced back to an axially\nsymmetric dyadotorus.

It inherits its robustness and accelerates\nits convergence rate computing a set of $P$ relaxation factors that result from\na minimization problem. In a typical SRJ scheme, the former set of factors is\nemployed in cycles of $M$ consecutive iterations until a prescribed tolerance\nis reached. We present the analytic form for the optimal set of relaxation\nfactors for the case in which all of them are different, and find that the\nresulting algorithm is equivalent to a non-stationary generalized Richardson's\nmethod. Our method to estimate the weights has the advantage that the explicit\ncomputation of the maximum and minimum eigenvalues of the matrix $A$ is\nreplaced by the (much easier) calculation of the maximum and minimum\nfrequencies derived from a von Neumann analysis. This set of weights is also\noptimal for the general problem, resulting in the fastest convergence of all\npossible SRJ schemes for a given grid structure.

Abstract: We analyze four extreme active galactic nuclei (AGN) transients to explore\nthe possibility that they are caused by rare, high-amplitude microlensing\nevents. These previously unknown type-I AGN are located in the redshift range\n0.6-1.1 and show changes of > 1.5 mag in the g-band on a time-scale of ~years.\nMulti-epoch optical spectroscopy, from the William Herschel Telescope, shows\nclear differential variability in the broad line fluxes with respect to the\ncontinuum changes and also evolution in the line profiles. In two cases, a\nsimple point-source, point-lens microlensing model provides an excellent match\nto the long-term variability seen in these objects. For both models, the\nparameter constraints are consistent with the microlensing being due to an\nintervening stellar mass object but as yet there is no confirmation of the\npresence of an intervening galaxy. The models predict a peak amplification of\n10.3/13.5 and an Einstein time-scale of 7.5/10.8 yr, respectively. In one case,\nthe data also allow constraints on the size of the CIII] emitting region, with\nsome simplifying assumptions, to to be ~1.0-6.5 light-days and a lower limit on\nthe size of the MgII emitting region to be > 9 light-days (half-light radii).\nThis CIII] radius is perhaps surprisingly small.

The majority of bright extragalactic gamma-ray sources are blazars.\nOnly a few radio galaxies have been detected by Fermi/LAT. Recently, the\nGHz-peaked spectrum source PKS 1718-649 was confirmed to be gamma-ray bright,\nproviding further evidence for the existence of a population of gamma-ray loud,\ncompact radio galaxies. A spectral turnover in the radio spectrum in the MHz to\nGHz range is a characteristic feature of these objects, which are thought to be\nyoung due to their small linear sizes. The multiwavelength properties of the\ngamma-ray source PMN J1603-4904 suggest that it is a member of this source\nclass. Aims. The known radio spectrum of PMN J1603-4904 can be described by a\npower law above 1 GHz. Using observations from the Giant Metrewave Radio\nTelescope (GMRT) at 150, 325, and 610 MHz, we investigate the behaviour of the\nspectrum at lower frequencies to search for a low-frequency turnover. Methods.\nData from the TIFR GMRT Sky Survey (TGSS ADR) catalogue and archival GMRT\nobservations were used to construct the first MHz to GHz spectrum of PMN\nJ1603-4904. Results. We detect a low-frequency turnover of the spectrum and\nmeasure the peak position at about 490 MHz (rest-frame), which, using the known\nrelation of peak frequency and linear size, translates into a maximum linear\nsource size of ~1.4 kpc. Conclusions. The detection of the MHz peak indicates\nthat PMN J1603-4904 is part of this population of radio galaxies with turnover\nfrequencies in the MHz to GHz regime. Therefore it can be considered the\nsecond, confirmed object of this kind detected in gamma-rays.

In this paper we study gravitational lensing by the binary black\nholes modeled as equal mass Majumdar-Papapetrou dihole metric and show that\nthis system displays features that are quite unprecedented and absent in any\nother lensing configuration investigated so far. We restrict our attention to\nthe light rays which move on the plane midway between the two identical black\nholes, which allows us to employ techniques developed for the equatorial\nlensing in spherically symmetric spacetimes. If distance between the two black\nholes is below a certain threshold value, the system admits two photon spheres.\nAs in the case of single black hole, infinitely many relativistic images are\nformed due to the light rays which turn back from the region outside the outer\n(unstable) photon sphere, all of which lie beyond a critical angular radius\nwith respect to the lens. However in the presence of the inner (stable) photon\nsphere, the effective potential now increases again and the light rays that\nenter the outer photon sphere can turn back, leading to the formation of a new\nset of infinitely many relativistic images, all of which lie below the critical\nradius from the lens mentioned above. As the distance between the two black\nhole increases, two photon spheres approach each other, merge and eventually\ndisappear. In the absence of photon sphere, apart from the formation of a\nfinite number of discrete relativistic images, the system remarkably admits a\nradial caustic, which has never been observed in the context of relativistic\nlensing before. Thus the system of binary black hole admits novel features both\nin the presence and absence of photon spheres.

We considered the stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and\nmetallicity determined from the host galaxy photometry and spectroscopy up to z\n= 2 and used them to compare the distribution of host galaxies to that of field\ngalaxies in the mass-metallicity and fundamental metallicity relation plane.

Recently, several empirical luminosity correlations have been\nstatistically proposed from GRB observations. However, to treat GRB as the\ndistance indicator, there are two key issues: the redshift evolution of\nluminosity correlations and their calibrations. In this paper, we choose the\nAmati relation, the correlation between the peak spectra energy and the\nequivalent isotropic energy of GRBs ($E_{\\rm p}-E_{\\rm iso}$), as an example,\nand find that the current GRB dataset implies that there could be a evolution\nof the luminosity correlation with respect to the redshift. Therefore, we\npropose an extended Amati relation with two extra redshift-dependent terms to\ncorrect the redshift evolution of GRB relation. Secondly, we carefully check\nthe reliability of the calibration method using the low-redshift GRB data.\nImportantly, we find that the low-redshift calibration method does not take\nwhole correlations between $\\Omega_{\\rm m}$ and coefficients into account.\nNeglecting these correlation information can break the degeneracies and obtain\nthe biased constraint on $\\Omega_{\\rm m}$ which is very sensitive to values of\nparameters for the calibration.

These are jetted\nactive galactic nuclei viewed at a small angle to the line-of-sight. Only a\nhandful of objects viewed at a larger angle are known so far to emit above 100\nGeV. Multi-wavelength studies of such objects up to the highest energies\nprovide new insights into the particle and radiation processes of active\ngalactic nuclei. We report the results from the first multi-wavelength campaign\nobserving the TeV detected nucleus of the active galaxy IC 310, whose jet is\nobserved at a moderate viewing angle of 10 deg - 20 deg. The multi-instrument\ncampaign was conducted between 2012 Nov. and 2013 Jan., and involved\nobservations with MAGIC, Fermi, INTEGRAL, Swift, OVRO, MOJAVE and EVN. These\nobservations were complemented with archival data from the AllWISE and 2MASS\ncatalogs. A one-zone synchrotron self-Compton model was applied to describe the\nbroad-band spectral energy distribution. IC 310 showed an extraordinary TeV\nflare at the beginning of the campaign, followed by a low, but still detectable\nTeV flux. Compared to previous measurements, the spectral shape was found to be\nsteeper during the low emission state. Simultaneous observations in the soft\nX-ray band showed an enhanced energy flux state and a harder-when-brighter\nspectral shape behaviour. No strong correlated flux variability was found in\nother frequency regimes. The broad-band spectral energy distribution obtained\nfrom these observations supports the hypothesis of a double-hump structure. The\nharder-when-brighter trend in the X-ray and VHE emission is consistent with the\nbehaviour expected from a synchrotron self-Compton scenario. The\ncontemporaneous broad-band spectral energy distribution is well described with\na one-zone synchrotron self-Compton model using parameters that are comparable\nto those found for other gamma-ray-emitting misaligned blazars. \n\n"}

While general relativity predicts only two\ntensor gravitational-wave polarizations, general metric theories of gravity\nallow for up to four additional vector and scalar modes. The detection of these\nalternative polarizations would represent a clear violation of general\nrelativity. The LIGO-Virgo detection of the binary black hole merger GW170814\nhas recently offered the first direct constraints on the polarization of\ngravitational waves. The current generation of ground-based detectors, however,\nis limited in its ability to sensitively determine the polarization content of\ntransient gravitational-wave signals. Observation of the stochastic\ngravitational-wave background, in contrast, offers a means of directly\nmeasuring generic gravitational-wave polarizations. The stochastic background,\narising from the superposition of many individually unresolvable\ngravitational-wave signals, may be detectable by Advanced LIGO at\ndesign-sensitivity.

Additionally we measure a small H-alpha equivalent width (EW)\nat the SN position of just 34 Angs, which is one of the lowest EWs measured at\nany SLSN or Gamma-Ray Burst position, and indicative of the progenitor star\nbeing comparatively old. We also compare the observed properties of NGC 3191\nwith other SLSN host galaxies. The solar-metallicity environment at the\nposition of SN 2017egm presents a challenge to our theoretical understanding,\nand our spatially resolved spectral analysis provides further constraints on\nthe progenitors of SLSNe. \n\n"}

They seem to belong to a class of events for\nwhich the fate as a genuine core-collapse supernova or a non-terminal explosion\nis still under debate. Our CMFGEN models suggest that the progenitor of\nSN2015bh had an effective temperature between 8700 and 10000 K, luminosity in\nthe range ~ 1.8-4.74e6 Lsun, contained at least 25% H in mass at the surface,\nand half-solar Fe abundances. The results also show that the progenitor of SN\n2015bh generated an extended wind with a mass-loss rate of ~ 6e-4 to 1.5e-3\nMsun/yr and a velocity of 1000 km/s. We determined that the wind extended to at\nleast 2.57e14 cm and lasted for at least 30 days prior to the observations,\nreleasing 5e-5 Msun into the circumstellar medium. In analogy to 2009ip, we\npropose that this is the material that the explosive ejecta could interact at\nlate epochs, perhaps producing observable signatures that can be probed with\nfuture observations. We conclude that the progenitor of SN 2015bh was most\nlikely a warm luminous blue variable of at least 35 Msun before the explosion.\nConsidering the high wind velocity, we cannot exclude the possibility that the\nprogenitor was a Wolf-Rayet star that inflated just before the 2013 eruption,\nsimilar to HD5980 during its 1994 episode. If the star survived, late-time\nspectroscopy may reveal either a similar LBV or a Wolf-Rayet star, depending on\nthe mass of the H envelope before the explosion.

Here we emphasize that two families of\ncompact stars, viz., neutron stars and strange stars, can coexist in nature,\nand that neutron stars can get converted to strange stars through the\nnucleation process of quark matter in the stellar center. From our fully\ngeneral relativistic numerical computations of the structures of fast-spinning\ncompact stars, known as millisecond pulsars, we find that such a stellar\nconversion causes a simultaneous spin-up and decrease in gravitational mass of\nthese stars. This is a new type of millisecond pulsar evolution through a new\nmechanism, which gives rise to relatively lower mass compact stars with higher\nspin rates. This could have implication for the observed mass and spin\ndistributions of millisecond pulsars. Such a stellar conversion can also rescue\nsome massive, spin-supported millisecond pulsars from collapsing into black\nholes. Besides, we extend the concept of critical mass $M_{\\rm cr}$ for the\nneutron star sequence (Berezhiani et al. 2003; Bombaci et al. 2004) to the case\nof fast-spinning neutron stars, and point out that neutron star EoS models\ncannot be ruled out by the stellar mass measurement alone.

Combining two radiative\ntransfer codes, we performed the first simulations of photons originating in\nthe gravity dominated vicinity of the black hole and scattering in structures\nall the way out to the parsec-scale torus and polar winds.

Like\nflat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), their gamma-ray emission is thought to be\nproduced via the external Compton mechanism whereby relativistic jet electrons\nupscatter a photon field external to the jet, e.g. from the accretion disc,\nbroad line region (BLR) and dusty torus, to higher energies. Here we study the\norigin of the gamma-ray emission in the lowest-redshift candidate among the\ncurrently-known gamma-ray emitting NLS1s, 1H 0323+342, and take a new approach.\nWe observationally constrain the external photon field using quasi-simultaneous\nnear-IR, optical and X-ray spectroscopy.

However, the physical\nmechanism responsible for driving the observed outflows remains unclear, and\nwhether it is due to momentum, energy, or radiation is still a matter of\ndebate. The observed outflow energetics, in particular the large measured\nvalues of the momentum ratio ($\\dot{p}/(L/c) \\sim 10$) and energy ratio\n($\\dot{E}_k/L \\sim 0.05$), seems to favour the energy-driving mechanism; and\nmost observational works have focused their comparison with wind energy-driven\nmodels. Here we show that AGN radiation pressure on dust can adequately\nreproduce the observed outflow energetics (mass outflow rate, momentum flux,\nand kinetic power), as well as the scalings with luminosity, provided that the\neffects of radiation trapping are properly taken into account. In particular,\nwe predict a sub-linear scaling for the mass outflow rate ($\\dot{M} \\propto\nL^{1/2}$) and a super-linear scaling for the kinetic power ($\\dot{E}_k \\propto\nL^{3/2}$), in agreement with the observational scaling relations reported in\nthe most recent compilation of AGN outflow data.

An important aspect of this new solution\nis that the semi-annihilation effects are much more prominent in dwarf-sized\nhalos than in the more massive halos that host galaxies and clusters, even if\nthe corresponding cross sections are the same. Furthermore, the preferred\nparameter space for solving the small-scale problem suggests a thermal dark\nmatter candidate with a mass below the GeV scale, which can be probed in dark\nmatter direct and indirect detection experiments. \n\n"}

In one such\ntest that is currently employed for LIGO black-hole binary mergers, generic\ndeviations from relativity are represented by $N$ deformation parameters in a\ngeneralised waveform model; the Bayesian evidence for each of its $2^N$\ncombinatorial submodels is then combined into a posterior odds ratio for\nmodified gravity over relativity in a null-hypothesis test.

This is because the ejecta is expanding and\nabsorbing thermal energy, so that the forward shock from a failed jet stalls\nbefore it reaches the edge of the ejecta. This conclusion can be circumvented\nonly for very energetic wide angle jets, with parameters that are uncomfortable\ngiven short-duration GRB observations. For successful jets, we find two regimes\nof jet breakout from the ejecta, early breakout on timescales shorter than the\nengine duration, and late breakout well after the engine shuts off. A late\nbreakout can explain the observed delay between gravitational waves and gamma\nrays in GW 170817. We show that for the entire parameter space of jet\nparameters surveyed here (covering energies $\\sim 10^{48}-10^{51}$ ergs and\nopening angles $\\theta_j \\sim 0.07-0.4$) the thermal energy deposited into the\nejecta by the jet propagation is less than that produced by r-process heating\non second timescales by a factor of $\\gtrsim 10$. Shock heating is thus\nenergetically subdominant in setting the luminosity of thermally powered\ntransients coincident with neutron star mergers (kilonovae). For typical short\nGRB jet parameters, our conclusion is stronger: there is little thermal energy\nin the cocoon, much less than what is needed to explain the early blue\ncomponent of the kilonova in GW 170817. \n\n"}

Non-thermal radio emission has been detected so far\nonly from the bowshock of BD+43{\\deg}3654, whereas the detection of non-thermal\nradiation from these bowshocks at high energies remains elusive. Aims: We aim\nat characterising in detail the radio, X-ray, and gamma-ray emission from\nstellar bowshocks accounting for the structure of the region of interaction\nbetween the stellar wind and its environment. Methods: We develop a\nbroadband-radiative, multi-zone model for stellar bowshocks that takes into\naccount the spatial structure of the emitting region and the observational\nconstraints. The model predicts the evolution and the emission of the\nrelativistic particles accelerated and streaming together with the shocked\nflow. Results: We present broadband non-thermal spectral energy distributions\nfor different scenarios, synthetic radio-cm synchrotron maps that reproduce the\nmorphology of BD+43{\\deg}3654, and updated predictions in X-ray and gamma-ray\nenergy ranges.

Similarly to the cloud Sgr B2, another well-known emitter of the\niron line in the GC, the Arches cloud demonstrates temporal decline of the\nX-ray emission. The most natural origin of this emission is irradiation of\nprimary photons of an X-ray flare from a distant source, most likely Sgr A*.\nHowever, recent observations of the Arches cloud discovered variations of\nequivalent width of the 6.4 keV iron line, which indicated that the X-ray\nemission from the cloud is a combination of two components with different\norigin and different equivalent width, one of which is time-variable, while the\nother is stationary during the period of observations. We considered two\ndifferent scenarios: a) this emission is formed by reflection from two clouds,\nwhich are at some distance from each other, when they are irradiated by two\ndifferent flares; and b) the other scenario assumes a combination of X-ray\nfluxes produced in the same cloud by reflection of primary photons and by\nsubrelativistic cosmic rays. We present restrictions for both model and\nconditions at which these scenarios can be realized. Although none of the\nmodels can be completely ruled out, we find that the X-ray reflection model\nrequires less assumption and therefore is the most viable. \n\n"}

We present the first detailed study of highly eccentric BNS\nsystems with full (3+1)D numerical relativity simulations using consistent\ninitial conditions, i.e., setups which are in agreement with the Einstein\nequations and with the equations of general relativistic hydrodynamics in\nequilibrium. Overall, our simulations cover two different equations of state\n(EOSs), two different spin configurations, and three to four different initial\neccentricities for each pairing of EOS and spin. We extract from the simulated\nwaveforms the frequency of the f-mode oscillations induced during close\nencounters before the merger of the two stars. The extracted frequency is in\ngood agreement with f-mode oscillations of individual stars for the\nirrotational cases, which allows an independent measure of the supranuclear\nequation of state not accessible for binaries on quasi-circular orbits. The\nenergy stored in these f-mode oscillations can be as large as $10^{-3}M_\\odot\n\\sim 10^{51}$ erg, even with a soft EOS.

We detect 128 NuSTAR sources to a\nsensitivity of $\\approx10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Using NuSTAR color-intensity and\ncolor-color diagrams we classify 43 of these sources as candidate NS and 47 as\ncandidate BH. We further subdivide BH by accretion states (soft, intermediate,\nand hard) and NS by weak (Z/Atoll) and strong (accreting pulsar) magnetic\nfield. Using 8 normal (Milky Way-type) galaxies in the sample, we confirm the\nrelation between SFR and galaxy X-ray point source luminosity in the 4-25 and\n12-25 keV energy bands. We also constrain galaxy X-ray point source luminosity\nusing the relation $L_{\\rm{X}}=\\alpha M_{\\star}+\\beta\\text{SFR}$, finding\nagreement with previous work. The XLF of all sources in the 4-25 and 12-25 keV\nenergy bands matches with the $\\alpha=1.6$ slope for high-mass XRBs. We find\nthat NS XLFs suggest a decline beginning at the Eddington limit for a 1.4\n$M_{\\odot}$ NS, whereas the BH fraction shows an approximate monotonic increase\nin the 4-25 and 12-25keV energy bands. We calculate the overall ratio of BH to\nNS to be $\\approx1$ for 4-25 keV and $\\approx2$ for 12-25 keV. \n\n"}

Aims: We explore the effect of including a magnetar on the light\ncurves of supernovae with H-rich progenitors. Methods: We have applied a\nversion of our one-dimensional LTE radiation hydrodynamics code that takes into\naccount the relativistic motion of the ejecta caused by the extra energy\nprovided by the magnetar. For a fixed red supergiant (RSG) progenitor, we have\nobtained a set of light curves that corresponds to different values of the\nmagnetar initial rotation energy and the spin-down timescale.

In the\npresent work we specifically focus on analysis of the non-relativistic axions\nwhich will be trapped by the Sun and Earth due to the gravitational forces. The\ncorresponding emission rate of these low energy axions (below the escape\nvelocity) is very tiny.

When the source is above the\nEddington limit, the hot spot temperature increases and the spectrum features\ntwo more blackbody components.
