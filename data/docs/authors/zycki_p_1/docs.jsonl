Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days.

As young AGN\n(quasars) they are initially several magnitudes sub-luminous to mature galaxies\nbut their luminosity gradually increases over 10^8 yrs, as z_(i) decreases and\nthey evolve into mature AGN (Seyferts and radio galaxies).

The galaxy is known to possess a dramatic 70 kpc\nX-ray tail. The detected H-alpha tail coincides positionally with the X-ray\ntail. The H-alpha emission in the galaxy is sharply truncated on the front and\nthe sides near the nucleus, indicating significant ram pressure stripping. ESO\n137-001 is thus the first cluster late-type galaxy known unambiguously with\nboth an X-ray tail and an H-alpha tail. The emission-line objects are all\ndistributed downstream of the galaxy, with projected distance up to 39 kpc from\nthe galaxy. From the analysis on the H-alpha_{off} frame and the estimate of\nthe background emission-line objects, we conclude that it is very likely all 29\nemission-line objects are HII regions in A3627.

This study aims to explain the M/L of globular clusters in four\ngalaxies by including stellar evolution, stellar remnants, and the preferential\nloss of low-mass stars due to energy equipartition. Analytical cluster models\nare applied that account for stellar evolution and dynamical cluster\ndissolution to samples of globular clusters in Cen A, the Milky Way, M31 and\nthe LMC. The models include stellar remnants and cover metallicities in the\nrange Z=0.0004-0.05.

This estimator is derived by\ntransforming the observed marginal power spectrum distributions obtained by the\nCMB Gibbs sampler into standard univariate Gaussians, and then approximate\ntheir joint transformed distribution by a multivariate Gaussian. The method is\nexact for full-sky coverage and uniform noise, and an excellent approximation\nfor sky cuts and scanning patterns relevant for modern satellite experiments\nsuch as WMAP and Planck. A single evaluation of this estimator between l=2 and\n200 takes ~0.2 CPU milliseconds, while for comparison, a single pixel space\nlikelihood evaluation between l=2 and 30 for a map with ~2500 pixels requires\n~20 seconds. We apply this tool to the 5-year WMAP temperature data, and\nre-estimate the angular temperature power spectrum, $C_{\\ell}$, and likelihood,\nL(C_l), for l<=200, and derive new cosmological parameters for the standard\nsix-parameter LambdaCDM model. Our spectrum is in excellent agreement with the\nofficial WMAP spectrum, but we find slight differences in the derived\ncosmological parameters.

In that case, we found that the sub-optimal likelihood approximation\nadopted between l=12 and 30 by the WMAP team biased n_s low by 0.4 sigma, while\nhere we find that the same approximation between l=30 and 200 introduces a bias\nof 0.6 sigma in n_s. \n\n"}

The sources are selected on the\nbasis of bright 24um fluxes (f_24um>0.4mJy) and of stellar dominated\nnear-infrared spectral energy distributions in order to favor z~2 starburst\ngalaxies. The average 1.2mm flux for the whole sample is 1.5+/-0.2 mJy. Our\nanalysis focuses on 29 sources in the Lockman Hole field where the average\n1.2mm flux (1.9+/-0.3 mJy) is higher than in other fields (1.1+/-0.2 mJy). The\nanalysis of the sources multi-wavelength spectral energy distributions\nindicates that they are starburst galaxies with far-infrared luminosities\n~10^12-10^13.3 Lsun, and stellar masses of ~0.2-6 x10^11 M_sun. Compared to\nsub-millimeter selected galaxies (SMGs), the SWIRE-MAMBO sources are among\nthose with the largest 24um/millimeter flux ratios. The origin of such large\nratios is investigated by comparing the average mid-infrared spectra and the\nstacked far-infrared spectral energy distributions of the SWIRE-MAMBO sources\nand of SMGs. The mid-infrared spectra exhibit strong PAH features, and a warm\ndust continuum. The warm dust continuum contributes to ~34% of the mid-infrared\nemission, and is likely associated with an AGN component. This constribution is\nconsistent with what is found in SMGs. The large 24um/1.2mm flux ratios are\nthus not due to AGN emission, but rather to enhanced PAH emission compared to\nSMGs. The analysis of the stacked far-infrared fluxes yields warmer dust\ntemperatures than typically observed in SMGs. Our selection favors warm\nultra-luminous infrared sources at high-z, a class of objects that is rarely\nfound in SMG samples.

They thereby\nchallenge the conventional LGRB-SN connection and naturally give rise to the\nquestion: are there other peculiar features in their afterglows which would\nhelp shed light on their progenitors? To answer this question, we combine new\nobservational data with published data and investigate the multi-band temporal\nand spectral properties of the two afterglows. We find that both afterglows can\nbe well interpreted within the framework of the jetted standard external shock\nwave model, and that the afterglow parameters for both bursts fall well within\nthe range observed for other LGRBs. Hence, from the properties of the\nafterglows there is nothing to suggest that these bursts should have another\nprogenitor than other LGRBs.

The initial velocity field in the\nturbulence is varied from being super-Alfv\\'enic and hypersonic, through to\ntrans-Alfv\\'enic but still supersonic.\n  We find that ambipolar diffusion increases the rate of decay of the\nturbulence increasing the decay from $t^{-1.25}$ to $t^{-1.4}$. The Hall effect\nhas virtually no impact in this regard. The power spectra of density, velocity\nand the magnetic field are all affected by the non-ideal terms, being steepened\nsignificantly when compared with ideal MHD turbulence with exponents. The\ndensity power spectra components change from about 1.4 to about 2.1 for the\nideal and non-ideal simulations respectively, and power spectra of the other\nvariables all show similar modifications when non-ideal effects are considered.\nAgain, the dominant source of these changes is ambipolar diffusion rather than\nthe Hall effect. There is also a decoupling between the velocity field and the\nmagnetic field at short length scales. The Hall effect leads to enhanced\nmagnetic reconnection, and hence less power, at short length scales. The\ndependence of the velocity dispersion on the characteristic length scale is\nstudied and found not to be power-law in nature. \n\n"}

We find that their star formation\nrates (average ~2500 MSun yr^{-1}), stellar (~3.6x10^{11} MSun) and dust\n(~6.7x10^{8} MSun) masses, extinction (A_V~2.2 mag), and gas-to-dust ratios\n(~60) are within the ranges for 1.7<z<3.6 SMGs. Our analysis suggests that\ninfrared-to-radio luminosity ratios of SMGs do not change up to redshift ~5 and\nare lower by a factor of ~2.1 than the value corresponding to the local\nIR-radio correlation. However, we also find dissimilarities between z>4 and\nlower-redshift SMGs. Those at z>4 tend to be among the most star-forming, least\nmassive and hottest (~60 K) SMGs and exhibit the highest fraction of stellar\nmass formed in the ongoing starburst (~45%). This indicates that at z>4 we see\nearlier stages of evolution of submillimeter-bright galaxies. Using the derived\nproperties for z>4 SMGs we investigate the origin of dust at epochs less than\n1.5 Gyr after the big bang. This is significant to our understanding of the\nevolution of the early universe. For three z>4 SMGs, asymptotic giant branch\nstars could be the dominant dust producers.

(2) A high mass IMF of peak mass\n~10Msun with the contribution of binaries, derived from the statistics of\ncarbon enhanced EMP stars (Komiya et al. 2007), predicts the frequency of\nlow-mass survivors consistent with the number of EMP stars observed for\n-4~<[Fe/H]~<-2.5. (3) The stars formed from primordial gas before the first\nsupernova explosions in their host mini-halos are assigned to the HMP stars\nwith [Fe/H]~-5. (4) There is no indication of significant changes in the IMF\nand the binary contribution at metallicity -4~<[Fe/H]~<-2.5, or even larger as\nlong as the field stars of Galactic halo are concerned. We further study the\neffects of the surface pollution through the accretion of ISM along the\nchemical and dynamical evolution of the Galaxy for low-mass Pop.III and EMP\nsurvivors. Because of shallower potential of smaller halos, the accretion of\nISM in the mini-halos in which these stars were born dominates the surface\nmetal pollution. This can account for the surface iron abundances as observed\nfor the HMP stars if the cooling and concentration of gas in their birth\nmini-halos is taken into account. We also study the feedback effect from the\nvery massive Pop. III stars. The metal pre-pollution by PISNe is shown to be\ncompatible with the observed lack of their nucleosynthetic signatures when some\npositive feedback on gas cooling works and changes IMF from being very massive\nto being high mass. \n\n"}

When paired with molecular spectroscopy of a\ndense gas tracer, millimeter observations yield physical properties such as\nmasses, radii, mean densities, kinetic temperatures and line widths. We detect\n34 distinct BGPS sources above 5-sigma=0.37 Jy/beam with corresponding 5-sigma\ndetections in the ammonia (1,1) transition. Eight of the objects show water\nmaser emission (20%). We find a mean millimeter source FWHM of 1.12 pc, and a\nmean kinetic temperature of 20 K for the sample of 34 BGPS sources. The\nobserved ammonia line widths are dominated by non-thermal motions, typically\nfound to be a few times the thermal sound speed expected for the derived\nkinetic temperature. We calculate the mass for each source from the millimeter\nflux assuming the sources are isothermal and find a mean isothermal mass within\na 120\" aperture of 230 +/- 180 solar masses. We find a total mass of 8,400\nsolar masses for all BGPS sources in the Gemini OB1 molecular cloud,\nrepresenting 6.5% of the cloud mass. By comparing the millimeter isothermal\nmass to the virial mass within a radius equal to the mm source size calculated\nfrom the ammonia line widths, we find a mean virial parameter (M_vir/M_iso) of\n1.0 +/- 0.9 for the sample.

We have\nrevised the treatments of the transition between the rapid infall and cooling\nflow regimes of gas accretion, of the sizes of bulges and of gaseous and\nstellar disks, of supernova feedback, of the transition between central and\nsatellite status as galaxies fall into larger systems, and of gas and star\nstripping once they become satellites. Plausible values of efficiency and\nscaling parameters yield an excellent fit not only to the observed abundance of\nlow-redshift galaxies over 5 orders of magnitude in stellar mass and 9\nmagnitudes in luminosity, but also to the observed abundance of Milky Way\nsatellites. This suggests that reionisation effects may not be needed to solve\nthe \"missing satellite\" problem except, perhaps, for the faintest objects. The\nsame model matches the observed large-scale clustering of galaxies as a\nfunction of stellar mass and colour. The fit remains excellent down to ~30kpc\nfor massive galaxies.

We refined the determination of the disk galaxies rotation\nvelocity, with a dynamical recipe for the rotation curve, rather than a simple\nconversion from the total mass to maximum velocity. The new recipe takes into\naccount the disk shape factor, and the angular momentum transfer occurring\nduring secular evolution leading to the formation of bulges. This produces\nmodel rotation velocities that are lower by ~20-25% for the majority of the\nspirals. We implemented stellar population models with a complete treatment of\nthe TP-AGB, which leads to a revision of the mass-to-light ratio in the\nnear-IR. I/K band luminosities increase by ~0.3/0.5 mags at redshift z=0 and by\n~0.5/1 mags at z=3. With these two new recipes in place, the comparison between\nthe predicted Tully-Fisher relation with a series of datasets in the optical\nand near-IR, at redshifts between 0 and 1, is used as a diagnostics of the\nassembly and evolution of spiral galaxies in the model. At 0.4<z<1.2 the match\nbetween the new model and data is remarkably good, especially for later-type\nspirals (Sb/Sc).

We argue that\nthis behaviour is caused by inadequate star formation histories in the model\ngalaxies at low redshifts. The star-formation rate declines too slowly, due to\ncontinuous gas infall that is not efficiently suppressed.

The resulting eccentricity distributions have an\napproximately triangular shape, with a peak at 0.2-0.35, and a relatively\nsmooth decline towards higher values. Stars originally in the satellite galaxy\ntend to have higher eccentricities (on average from e = 0.45 to e = 0.75),\nwhich is in general agreement with the models of Sales and collaborators,\nalthough in detail we find fewer stars with extreme values and no evidence of\ntheir secondary peak around e = 0.8.

The SN Ia sample was originally used by Wang et al. (2009) to show that\nthe relationship between color excess and peak magnitude, which in the absence\nof intrinsic color differences describes a reddening law, was different for two\nsubsamples split by v_Si (defined as \"Normal\" and \"High-Velocity\"). We verify\nthis result, but find that the two subsamples have the same reddening law when\nextremely reddened events (E(B-V) > 0.35 mag) are excluded. We also show that\n(1) the High-Velocity subsample is offset by ~0.06 mag to the red from the\nNormal subsample in the (B_max - V_max) - M_V plane, (2) the B_max - V_max\ncumulative distribution functions of the two subsamples have nearly identical\nshapes, but the High-Velocity subsample is offset by ~0.07 mag to the red in\nB_max - V_max, and (3) the bluest High-Velocity SNe Ia are ~0.10 mag redder\nthan the bluest Normal SNe Ia. Together, this evidence indicates a difference\nin intrinsic color for the subsamples. Accounting for this intrinsic color\ndifference reduces the scatter in Hubble residuals from 0.190 mag to 0.130 mag\nfor SNe Ia with A_V < 0.7 mag. The scatter can be further reduced to 0.109 mag\nby exclusively using SNe Ia from the Normal subsample. Additionally, this\nresult can at least partially explain the anomalously low values of R_V found\nin large SN Ia samples. We explain the correlation between ejecta velocity and\ncolor as increased line blanketing in the High-Velocity SNe Ia, causing them to\nbecome redder.

The radiation and\nparticle fluxes from flares may also exert a significant influence on the\natmospheres of orbiting planets, and affect their habitability. We present a\nstatistical model of flaring M dwarfs in the Galaxy that allows us to predict\nthe observed flare rate along a given line of sight for a particular survey\ndepth and cadence. The parameters that enter the model are the Galactic\nstructure, the distribution of magnetically active and inactive M dwarfs, and\nthe flare frequency distribution (FFD) of both populations. The FFD is a\nfunction of spectral type, activity, and Galactic height. Although inactive M\ndwarfs make up the majority of stars in a magnitude-limited survey, the FFD of\ninactive stars is very poorly constrained.

The 6 cm observations detect diffuse linearly-polarized emission\nthroughout the region with a brightness of roughly 1 mJy per 15\"x10\" beam. The\nFaraday rotation measure (RM) toward this polarized emission has structure on\ndegree size scales and ranges from roughly +330 rad/m2 east of the dynamical\ncenter (Sgr A) to -880 rad/m2 west of the dynamical center. This RM structure\nis also seen toward several nonthermal radio filaments, which implies that they\nhave a similar magnetic field orientation and constrains models for their\norigin. Modeling shows that the RM and its change with Galactic longitude are\nbest explained by the high electron density and strong magnetic field of the GC\nregion.

When $M_{crit}$ is higher than the maximum mass achieved by the WD,\nthe WD must spin down before it can explode. This introduces a delay between\nthe time at which the WD has completed its epoch of mass gain and the time of\nthe explosion. Matter ejected from the binary during mass transfer therefore\nhas a chance to become diffuse, and the explosion occurs in a medium with a\ndensity similar to that of typical regions of the interstellar medium. Also,\neither by the end of the WD's mass increase or else by the time of explosion,\nthe donor may exhaust its stellar envelope and become a WD. This alters,\ngenerally diminishing, explosion signatures related to the donor star.\nNevertheless, the spin-up/spin-down model is highly predictive.

It resembles that of an M6 giant, although the molecular\nbands in V838 Mon are deeper than those in standard stellar spectra of a\nsimilar spectral class. Several atomic lines, which displayed P-Cyg profiles in\n2005, are now dominated by pure absorptions. Some of these lines, however, show\na narrow emission component, which, as we argue, measures the radial velocity\nof V838 Mon. The resulting heliocentric velocity is 71 km/s, which very well\nagrees with the velocity obtained from SiO maser observations. The atomic lines\nand the molecular bands show very complex kinematics. In some atomic lines and\nhigh-excitation molecular bands we observe matter infalling in the object\natmosphere. The infall components were already observed in 2005, but were less\npronounced and present in fewer lines than in 2009. We argue that the most\nnegative radial velocity components seen in the resonance atomic lines and in\nthe low-excitation molecular bands were formed in the ejecta of the 2002\neruption. The B3V companion most probably became engulfed in an opaque dusty\nmatter of the 2002 V838 Mon ejecta. \n\n"}

Simultaneously, the asymmetry of a\ngalaxy's stellar disk, in combination with other morphological parameters, has\nseen extensive use as an indication of recent merger or interaction in galaxy\nsamples. Quantified morphology of stellar spiral disks is one avenue to\ndetermine the merger rate over much of the age of the Universe. In this paper,\nwe measure the quantitative morphology parameters for the HI column density\nmaps from the Westerbork observations of neutral Hydrogen in Irregular and\nSPiral galaxies (WHISP). These are Concentration, Asymmetry, Smoothness, Gini,\nM20, and one addition of our own, the Gini parameter of the second order moment\n(GM). Our aim is to determine if lopsided or interacting disks can be\nidentified with these parameters. Our sample of 141 HI maps have all previous\nclassifications on their lopsidedness and interaction. We find that the\nAsymmetry, M20, and our new GM parameter correlate only weakly with the\nprevious morphological lopsidedness quantification. These three parameters may\nbe used to compute a probability that an HI disk is morphologically lopsided\nbut not unequivocally to determine it.

Parameter cuts from the literature do not translate\nfrom ultraviolet to HI directly but new selection criteria using combinations\nof Asymmetry and M20 or Concentration and M20, work very well.

Because of the\nnonrelativistic dispersion relations, the speed of light is unlimited, and test\nparticles do not follow geodesics. As a result, there are significant\ndifferences in causal structures and black holes between general relativity\n(GR) and the HL theory. In particular, the horizon radii generically depend on\nthe energies of test particles. Applying them to the spherical static vacuum\nsolutions found recently in the nonrelativistic general covariant theory of\ngravity, we find that, for test particles with sufficiently high energy, the\nradius of the horizon can be made as small as desired, although the\nsingularities can be seen in principle only by observers with infinitely high\nenergy.

Abstract: Recent observations show that supergiant fast X-ray transients (SFXTs) spend\nmost of their lifetime at an intermediate level luminosity $\\sim\n10^{33}-10^{34}$ ergs$^{-1}$, and, when a blackbody model for the spectra is\nadopted, the resulting radii of the emission region are always only a few\nhundred meters, supporting the idea that during the intermediate state SFXTs\nare accreting matter from the companion star. From these observational\nphenomena we derive possible constraints on the magnetic field strengths of the\nneutron stars in four SFXTs with known spin periods. While IGR J11215$-$5952,\nIGR J16465$-$4507, and IGR J18483$-$0311 may have magnetic fields (up to a few\n$10^{11}-10^{12}$ G) similar to those of normal X-ray pulsars, the magnetic\nfield of AX J1841.0$-$0536 is considerably low ($\\la 10^{10}$ G).

We\nuse two-dimensional numerical simulations to investigate the evolution of\nself-gravitating discs as a function of the local cooling time and strength of\nirradiation. In the regime where the disc does not fragment, we show that local\nthermal equilibrium continues to determine the stress - which can be\nrepresented as an effective viscous alpha - out to very long cooling times (at\nleast 240 dynamical times).

The gravitational energy released by the mass inflow down\nthe gravitational potential gradient drives the disc turbulence that maintains\nthe disc unstable with a Toomre instability parameter Q~1, compensating for the\ndissipative losses of the gas turbulence and raising the stellar velocity\ndispersion. We follow the velocity dispersion of stars and gas as they heat and\ncool respectively and search for disc `stabilization', to be marked by a low\ngas velocity dispersion comparable to the speed of sound ~10 km/s.

The criterion to enter the pair\ninstability regime in density and temperature is basically controlled by the\nmass of the oxygen core. The main sequence masses that produce a given oxygen\ncore mass are, in turn, dependent on metallicity, mass loss, and convective and\nrotationally-induced mixing. We examine the evolution of massive stars to\ndetermine the minimum main sequence mass that can encounter pair-instability\neffects, either a pulsational pair instability (PPISN) or a full-fledged\npair-instability supernova (PISN). We concentrate on zero-metallicity stars\nwith no mass loss subject to the Schwarzschild criterion for convective\ninstability, but also explore solar metallicity and mass loss and the Ledoux\ncriterion. As expected, for sufficiently strong rotationally-induced mixing,\nthe minimum main sequence mass is encountered for conditions that induce\neffectively homogeneous evolution such that the original mass is converted\nalmost entirely to helium and then to oxygen. For this case, we find that the\nminimum main sequence mass is ~40 Msun to encounter PPISN and ~65 Msun to\nencounter a PISN. When mass-loss is taken into account those mass limits become\n~50 Msun for PPISN and ~80 Msun for PISN progenitors.

{"id": "1206.0691", "contents": "Title: Long-term luminosity behavior of 14 ultracompact X-ray binaries Abstract: Context. X-ray binaries are usually divided in persistent and transient\nsources. For ultracompact X-ray binaries (UCXBs), the mass transfer rate is\nexpected to be a strong function of orbital period, predicting persistent\nsources at short periods and transients at long periods. Aims. For 14 UCXBs\nincluding two candidates, we investigate the long-term variability and average\nluminosity with the purpose of learning how often a source can be expected to\nbe visible above a given luminosity, and we compare the derived luminosities\nwith the theoretical predictions. Methods. We use data from the RXTE All-Sky\nMonitor because of its long-term, unbiased observations. Many UCXBs are faint,\ni.e., they have a count rate at the noise level for most of the time. Still,\ninformation can be extracted from the data, either by using only reliable data\npoints or by combining the bright-end variability behavior with the\ntime-averaged luminosity. Results. Luminosity probability distributions show\nthe fraction of time that a source emits above a given luminosity. All UCXBs\nshow significant variability and relatively similar behavior, though the\ntime-averaged luminosity implies higher variability in systems with a period\nlonger than 40 min. Conclusions. There is no large difference in the\nstatistical luminosity behavior of what we usually call persistent and\ntransient sources. UCXBs with a period below ~30 min have a time-averaged\nbolometric luminosity that is in reasonable agreement with estimates based on\nthe theoretical mass transfer rate. Around 40 min the lower bound on the\ntime-averaged luminosity is similar to the luminosity based on the theoretical\nmass transfer rate, suggesting these sources are indeed faint when not\ndetected. Above 50 min some systems are much brighter than the theoretical mass\ntransfer rate predicts, unless these systems have helium burning donors or lose\nadditional angular momentum. \n\n"}

We present a comparison that can\nshow the level of tidal dissipation (friction) as a function of the\ndistribution of the ages of the star and planet system, with known dependencies\non basic star and planet parameters.

(Nature, 2009)\nwho argued that semi-analytic models based on the Millennium simulation cannot\nreproduce the red colours and high luminosity of BCGs at z>1. We show instead\nthat the model is well in range of the observed luminosity and correctly\nreproduces the colour evolution of BCGs in the whole redshift range up to\nz~1.6. We argue that the success of the semi-analytic model is in large part\ndue to the implementation of a more sophisticated spectro-photometric model. An\nanalysis of the model BCGs shows an increase in mass by a factor ~2 since z~1,\nand star formation activity down to low redshifts. While the consensus\nregarding BCGs is that they are passively evolving, we argue that this\nconclusion is affected by the degeneracy between star formation history and\nstellar population models used in SED-fitting, and by the inefficacy of\ntoy-models of passive evolution to capture the complexity of real galaxies,\nexpecially those with rich merger histories like BCGs. Following this argument,\nwe also show that in the semi-analytic model the BCGs show a realistic mix of\nstellar populations, and that these stellar populations are mostly old. In\naddition, the age-redshift relation of the model BCGs follows that of the\nuniverse, meaning that given their merger history and star formation history,\nthe ageing of BCGs is always dominated by the ageing of their stellar\npopulations. In a LambdaCDM universe, we define such evolution as \"passive in\nthe hierarchical sense\". \n\n"}

Such equivalence takes place only for a certain class of\ncosmological potentials, dubbed here {\\em withholding potentials}, since they\nprevent change of the sign of dilaton $\\Phi$. The withholding property ensures\nthe attractive character of gravity, as well as absence of ghosts and a tachyon\nin the gravi-dilaton sector and yields certain asymptotic of the admissible\nfunctions $f(R)$. Large classes of withholding cosmological potentials and\nfunctions $f(R)$ are found and described in detail. It is shown that the\npopular choices of $f(R)$ functions are not withholding ones.

Metal-poor dSph stars also help to reveal the\nformation mechanism of the Milky Way halo. We present the detailed abundances\nfrom Keck/HIRES spectroscopy for two very metal-poor stars in two Milky Way\ndSphs. One star, in the Sculptor dSph, has [Fe I/H] = -2.40. The other star, in\nthe Ursa Minor dSph, has [Fe I/H] = -3.16. Both stars fall in the previously\ndiscovered low-metallicity, high-[alpha/Fe] plateau.

We calculate the typical Jeans mass using\nhigh-resolution hydrodynamic simulations coupled with a fully radiative model\nfor the ISM, which yields a parameterisation of the IMF characteristic mass as\na function of galaxy star formation rate (SFR). We then calculate the star\nformation histories of galaxies utilising an equilibrium galaxy growth model\ncoupled with constraints on the star formation histories set by abundance\nmatching models. We find that at early times, energetic coupling between dust\nand gas drive warm conditions in the ISM, yielding bottom-light/top- heavy IMFs\nassociated with large ISM Jeans masses for massive star-forming galaxies. Owing\nto the remnants of massive stars that formed during the top-heavy phases at\nearly times, the resultant M/L_K(sigma) in massive galaxies at the present\nepoch is increased relative to the non- varying IMF case. At late times, lower\ncosmic ray fluxes allow for cooler ISM temperatures in massive galaxies, and\nhence newly formed clusters will exhibit bottom-heavy IMFs, further increasing\nM/L_K(sigma).

In standard cosmology, it is assumed that the universe\nis homogeneous, but this is not true at small scales (<200 Mpc). Since general\nrelativity, which is the basis of modern cosmology, is a non-linear theory, one\ncan expect some backreactions in the case of an inhomogeneous matter\ndistribution. Estimates of the magnitude of these backreactions (feedback)\nrange from insignificant to being perfectly able to explain the accelerated\nexpansion of the universe. In the end, the only way to be sure is to test\npredictions of inhomogeneous cosmological theories, such as timescape\ncosmology, against observational data. If these theories provide a valid\ndescription of the universe, one expects aside other effects, that there is a\ndependence of the Hubble parameter on the line of sight matter distribution.\nThe redshift of a galaxy, which is located at a certain distance, is expected\nto be smaller if the environment in the line of sight is mainly high density\n(clusters), rather than mainly low density environment (voids).

The stronger photometric period around 0.12245 d, which had been\ndetected from the ground-based observation, was found to be variable, and we\nidentified this period as being the positive superhump period. This superhump\nperiod showed short-term (10-20 d) and strong variations in period most\nunexpectedly when the object entered a slightly faint state. The fractional\nsuperhump excess varied as large as ~30%. The variation of the period very well\ntraced the variation of the brightness of the system. The time-scales of this\nvariation of the superhump period was too slow to be interpreted as the\nvariation caused by the change in the disk radius due to the thermal disk\ninstability. We interpreted that the period variation was caused by the varying\npressure effect on the period of positive superhumps.

Our previous\nsimulations have demonstrated that the primary features of the Fermi bubbles\ncould be successfully reproduced by recent jet activity from the central active\ngalactic nucleus (AGN). In this work, we generate gamma-ray and microwave maps\nand spectra based on the simulated properties of cosmic rays (CRs) and magnetic\nfields in order to examine whether the observed bubble and haze emission could\nbe explained by leptons contained in the AGN jets. We also investigate the\nmodel predictions of the polarization properties of the Fermi bubbles. We find\nthat: (1) The same population of leptons can simultaneously explain the bubble\nand haze emission given that the magnetic fields within the bubbles are very\nclose to the exponentially distributed ambient field, which can be explained by\nmixing in of the ambient field followed by turbulent field amplification; (2)\nThe centrally peaked microwave profile suggests CR replenishment, which is\nconsistent with the presence of a more recent second jet event; (3) The bubble\ninterior exhibits a high degree of polarization because of ordered radial\nmagnetic field lines stretched by elongated vortices behind the shocks;\nhighly-polarized signals could also be observed inside the draping layer; (4)\nEnhancement of rotation measures could exist within the shock-compressed layer\nbecause of increased gas density and more amplified and ordered magnetic\nfields.

We examine N-body simulations and find that\ndue to the bar slowing down and disk thickening during bar buckling, the\nresonance and associated peanut-shape moves outward. The peanut-shape is\nconsistent with the location of the vertical resonance, independent of whether\nthe bar buckled or not. We estimate the resonance width from the potential m=4\nFourier component and find that the resonance is narrow, affecting orbits over\na narrow range in the angular momentum distribution, dL/L ~ 0.05. As the\nresonance moves outward, stars originally in the mid plane are forced out of\nthe mid plane into orbits just within the resonance separatrix. The height of\nthe separatrix orbits, estimated from the Hamiltonian model, is approximately\nconsistent with the peanut-shape height. The X-shape is comprised of stars in\nthe vicinity of the resonance separatrix. The velocity distributions from the\nsimulations illustrate that low inclination orbits are depleted within\nresonance.

It is shown that, in general, the traditional\nway of characterizing sizes and masses of halos dramatically overpredicts the\ndegree of evolution in the last 10 Gyr, especially for low-mass halos. This\npseudo-evolution leads to the illusion of growth even though there are no major\nchanges within fixed physical scales. Such formal size definitions also serve\nas proxies for the virialized region of a halo in the literature.

When gravity is modified, this is typically\naccompanied by the introduction of an additional scalar degree of freedom,\nwhich mediates an attractive fifth force. The presence of an extra\ngravitational coupling, however, is tightly constrained by local measurements.\nIn chameleon modifications of gravity, local tests can be evaded by employing a\nscreening mechanism that suppresses the fifth force in dense environments.\nWhile the chameleon field may be screened in the interior of the cluster, its\nouter region can still be affected by the extra force, introducing a deviation\nbetween the hydrostatic and lensing mass of the cluster. Thus, the chameleon\nmodification can be tested by combining the gas and lensing measurements of the\ncluster. We demonstrate the operability of our method with the Coma cluster,\nfor which both a lensing measurement and gas observations from the X-ray\nsurface brightness, the X-ray temperature, and the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect\nare available.

This phenomenon\nshows that the massive central black hole has a significant dynamical influence\non the gas, triggering its fueling.\n  The gaseous spiral is well correlated with the dusty spiral seen through\nextinction in HST images, and also with a spiral feature emitting 0.87mm\ncontinuum.

Recognizing hybrid inflation as a two-field model resolves two\nshortcomings often times attributed to it: The fine-tuning problem of the\ninitial conditions is greatly relaxed and a spectral index in accordance with\nthe PLANCK data can be achieved in a large part of the parameter space without\nthe aid of supergravity corrections.

The most common type of variability, the S Dor instability, occurs on\ntimescales of tens of years.

Specifically, the present-day binary fractions inside\nthe half-mass radius r$_{\\rm h}$ can be reproduced assuming either high initial\nbinary fractions near unity with a dominant soft binary component as in the\nKroupa distribution combined with high initial densities (10$^4$-10$^6$\nM$_{\\odot}$ pc$^{-3}$), or low initial binary fractions ($\\sim$ 5-10%) with a\ndominant hard binary component combined with moderate initial densities near\ntheir present-day values (10$^2$-10$^3$ M$_{\\odot}$ pc$^{-3}$). This apparent\ndegeneracy can be broken using the binary fractions outside r$_{\\rm h}$- only\nhigh initial binary fractions with a significant soft component combined with\nhigh initial densities can contribute to reproducing the observed\nanti-correlation between the binary fractions outside r$_{\\rm h}$ and the total\ncluster mass. We further illustrate using the simulated present-day binary\norbital parameter distributions and the technique introduced in Leigh et al.\n(2012) that the relative fractions of hard and soft binaries can be used to\nfurther constrain the initial cluster density and mass-density relation.

We consider\nthe effects of anisotropic radiation from accretion disks on the broad-line\nregion (BLR), from the Shakura-Sunyaev regime to slim disks with\nsuper-Eddington accretion rates. The geometrically thick funnel of the inner\nregion of slim disks produces strong self-shadowing effects that lead to very\nstrong anisotropy of the radiation field. We demonstrate that the degree of\nanisotropy of the radiation fields grows with increasing accretion rate. As a\nresult of this anisotropy, BLR clouds receive different spectral energy\ndistributions depending on their location relative to the disk, resulting in\ndiverse observational appearance of the BLR. We show that the self-shadowing of\nthe inner parts of the disk naturally produces two dynamically distinct regions\nof the BLR, depending on accretion rate. These two regions manifest themselves\nas kinematically distinct components of the broad H$\\beta$ line profile with\ndifferent line widths and fluxes, which jointly account for the Lorentzian\nprofile generally observed in narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies. In the time\ndomain, these two components are expected reverberate with different time lags\nwith respect to the varying ionizing continuum, depending on the accretion rate\nand the viewing angle of the observer.

The intergalactic medium prescription of Inoue et\nal.(2014) and galaxy synthesis models of Bruzual&Charlot (2003) have been used\nto properly treat the ultraviolet stellar emission, the stochasticity of the\nintergalactic transmission and mean free path in the ionizing regime. Color\ntracks are computed by turning on/off the escape fraction of ionizing\nradiation. At variance with recent studies, a careful treatment of IGM\ntransmission leads to no significant effects on the high-redshift broad-band\ncolor selection. The decreasing mean free path of ionizing photons with\nincreasing redshift further diminishes the contribution of the LyC to\nbroad-band colors. We also demonstrate that prominent LyC sources can be\nselected under suitable conditions by calculating the probability of a null\nescaping ionizing radiation. The method is applied to a sample of galaxies\nextracted from the GOODS-S field. A known LyC source at z=3.795 is successfully\nrecovered as a LyC emitter candidate and another convincing candidate at\nz=3.212 is reported. A detailed analysis of the two sources (including their\nvariability and morphology) suggests a possible mixture of stellar and\nnon-stellar (AGN) contribution in the ultraviolet.

Stringent pre-discovery\nlimits constrain the explosion epoch with fair precision to JD = 2456203.8 +-\n4.0. The rise time to the I-band light curve maximum is about two weeks.

We developed this relation from a\ncritically evaluated sample of primary calibrating PNe. The robust nature of\nthe method results from our revised calibrating distances with significantly\nreduced systematic uncertainties, and the recent availability of high-quality\ndata, including updated nebular diameters and integrated H$\\alpha$ fluxes. The\nS-r technique is simple in its application, requiring only an angular size, an\nintegrated H\\alpha\\ flux, and the reddening to the PN. From these quantities,\nan intrinsic radius is calculated, which when combined with the angular size,\nyields the distance directly. Furthermore, we have found that optically thick\nPNe tend to populate the upper bound of the trend, while optically-thin PNe\nfall along the lower boundary in the S-r plane. This enables sub-trends to be\ndeveloped which offer even better precision in the determination of distances,\nas good as 18 per cent in the case of optically-thin, high-excitation PNe.

We simulate merger events between two identical dwarfs changing\nthe initial inclination of their disks with respect to the orbit and the amount\nof orbital angular momentum. On radial orbits the amount of prolate rotation in\nthe merger remnants correlates strongly with the inclination of the disks and\nis well understood as due to the conservation of the angular momentum component\nof the disks along the merger axis. For non-radial orbits prolate rotation may\nstill be produced if the orbital angular momentum is initially not much larger\nthan the intrinsic angular momentum of the disks. The orbital structure of the\nremnants with significant rotation is dominated by box orbits in the center and\nlong-axis tubes in the outer parts.

It is generally accepted that these jets are powered\nelectromagnetically, by the magnetised rotation of a central compact object.\nHowever, how they produce the observed emission and survive the propagation for\nmany orders of magnitude in distance without being disrupted by current-driven\nnon-axisymmetric instabilities is the subject of active debate. We carry out\ntime-dependent 3D relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of relativistic,\nPoynting flux dominated jets. The jets are launched self-consistently by the\nrotation of a strongly magnetised central compact object. This determines the\nnatural degree of azimuthal magnetic field winding, a crucial factor that\ncontrols jet stability. We find that the jets are susceptible to two types of\ninstability: (i) a global, external kink mode that grows on long time scales\nand causes the jets to bodily bend sideways. Whereas this mode does not cause\njet disruption over the simulated distances, it substantially reduces jet\npropagation speed. We show, via an analytic model, that the growth of the\nexternal kink mode depends on the slope of the ambient medium density profile.\nIn flat density distributions characteristic of galactic cores, an AGN jet may\nstall, whereas in stellar envelopes the external kink weakens as the jet\npropagates outward; (ii) a local, internal kink mode that grows over short time\nscales and causes small-angle magnetic reconnection and conversion of about\nhalf of jet electromagnetic energy flux into heat. Based on the robustness and\nenergetics of the internal kink mode, we suggest that this instability is the\nmain dissipation mechanism responsible for powering GRB prompt emission. \n\n"}

The FOV\ncovered an axial extent 0.1-0.7r_25 (1-7kpc). We used pPXF and the MILES\nlibrary to obtain velocity and stellar population maps. We compared our\nkinematic data with simple GADGET-2 models.\n  The apparent rotational lag of the thick disc of ESO533-4 is compatible with\nthat expected from the combinations of two effects: differential asymmetric\ndrift and the projection effects arising from studying a disc a few degrees\n(2-3) away from edge-on. Thus, ESO533-4 contains little or no retrograde\nmaterial. This is compatible with three formation scenarii: the secular heating\nof an initially thin disc, the formation of the thick disc at high redshift in\na turbulent disc phase, and its creation in a major merger event. If happening\nin all galaxies, this last mechanism would cause retrograde thick discs in half\nof them. Retrograde discs have not been observed in the five massive disc\ngalaxies (v_c>120km s^-1) for which thick disc kinematics are known.

They are\ncommonly referred to as the leading actors of feedback processes. Evidence of\nultra-fast (v>0.05c) outflows in the innermost regions of AGN has been\ncollected in the past decade by sensitive X-ray observations for sizable\nsamples of AGN, mostly at low redshift. Here we present ultra-deep XMM-Newton\nand Chandra spectral data of an obscured (Nh~2x10^{23} cm^-2), intrinsically\nluminous (L2-10keV~4x10^{44} erg/s) quasar (named PID352) at z~1.6 (derived\nfrom the X-ray spectral analysis) in the Chandra Deep Field-South. The source\nis characterized by an iron emission and absorption line complex at observed\nenergies of E~2-3 keV. While the emission line is interpreted as being due to\nneutral iron (consistent with the presence of cold absorption), the absorption\nfeature is due to highly ionized iron transitions (FeXXV, FeXXVI) with an\noutflowing velocity of 0.14^{+0.02}_{-0.06}c, as derived from photoionization\nmodels. The mass outflow rate - ~2 Msun/yr - is similar to the source accretion\nrate, and the derived mechanical energy rate is ~9.5x10^{44} erg/s,\ncorresponding to 9% of the source bolometric luminosity. PID352 represents one\nof the few cases where indications of X-ray outflowing gas have been observed\nat high redshift thus far.

We also visually identify mergers.\nAdditionally, we provide a quantitative measure of the degree of disturbance\nfor each galaxy (\"roughness\"). The majority of elliptical and lenticular\ngalaxies have relaxed structure, showing no signs of ongoing star formation.\nStructurally-disturbed galaxies, which tend to avoid the lowest-density\nregions, have higher star-formation activity and younger stellar populations\nthan undisturbed systems. Cluster spirals with reduced/quenched star formation\nhave somewhat less disturbed morphologies than spirals with \"normal\"\nstar-formation activity, suggesting that these \"passive\" spirals have started\ntheir morphological transformation into S0s.

The degree of enhanced star\nformation is thus linked to the degree of structural disturbance, regardless of\nwhether it is caused by major mergers or not.

Any physical process that produces \"roughness\", or regions of\nenhanced luminosity density, will increase the star-formation activity in a\ngalaxy with similar efficiency.

In this paper, we study the\naccretion of He-rich matter onto CO WDs and explore a scenario in which a\nstrong wind forms on the surface of the WD if the total luminosity exceeds the\nEddington limit. Using a stellar evolution code called modules for experiments\nin stellar astrophysics (MESA), we simulated the He accretion process onto CO\nWDs for WDs with masses of 0.6-1.35Msun and various accretion rates of\n10^{-8}-10^{-5}Msun/yr.

Abstract: Collisions of white dwarfs (WDs) have recently been invoked as a possible\nmechanism for type Ia supernovae (SNIa). A pivotal feature for the viability of\nWD collisions as SNIa progenitors is that a significant fraction of the mass is\nhighly compressed to the densities required for efficient $^{56}$Ni production\nbefore the ignition of the detonation wave. Previous studies have predominantly\nemployed model WDs composed entirely of carbon-oxygen (CO), whereas WDs are\nexpected to have a non-negligible helium envelope. Given that helium is more\nsusceptible to explosive burning than CO under the conditions characteristic of\nWD collision, a legitimate concern is whether or not early time He detonation\nignition can translate to early time CO detonation, thereby drastically\nreducing $^{56}$Ni synthesis. We investigate the role of He in determining the\nfate of WD collisions by performing a series of two-dimensional hydrodynamics\ncalculations. We find that a necessary condition for non-trivial reduction of\nthe CO ignition time is that the He detonation birthed in the contact region\nsuccessfully propagates into the unshocked shell. We determine the minimal He\nshell mass as a function of the total WD mass that upholds this condition.\nAlthough we utilize a simplified reaction network similar to those used in\nprevious studies, our findings are in good agreement with detailed\ninvestigations concerning the impact of network size on He shell detonations.\nThis allows us to extend our results to the case with more realistic burning\nphysics. Based on the comparison of these findings against evolutionary\ncalculations of WD compositions, we conclude that most, if not all, WD\ncollisions will not be drastically impacted by their intrinsic He components. \n\n"}

In the presence of external pressure,\nthe pressure gradient set up within a self-gravitating isothermal cloud leads\nto a non-uniform density distribution. Thus the local environment of a cloud\ninfluences its internal structure. In the simple equilibrium model, the\nfraction of gas at high density in the cloud interior is determined simply by\nthe cloud surface density, which is itself inherited from the pressure in the\nimmediate surroundings. This idea is tested using measurements of the\nproperties of local clouds, which are found to show remarkable agreement with\nthe simple equilibrium model. The model also naturally predicts the star\nformation relation observed on cloud scales and, at the same time, provides a\nmapping between this relation and the closer-to-linear molecular star formation\nrelation measured on larger scales in galaxies. The key is that pressure\nregulates not only the molecular content of the ISM but also the cloud surface\ndensity.

In\nthe limit where there are many gravitational wave sources in the sky, or many\npulsars in the array, the signals produce a unique tensor correlation pattern\nthat depends only on the angular separation between each pulsar pair. It is\nthis distinct fingerprint that is used to search for gravitational waves using\npulsar timing arrays.

Past surveys\nhave achieved photometric precision of 1-2% by calibrating the survey's stellar\nphotometry with repeated measurements of a large number of stars observed in\nmultiple epochs. The calibration techniques employed by these surveys only\nconsider the relative frame-by-frame photometric zeropoint offset and the focal\nplane position-dependent illumination corrections, which are independent of the\nsource color. However, variations in the wavelength dependence of the\natmospheric transmission and the instrumental throughput induce source\ncolor-dependent systematic errors. These systematic errors must also be\nconsidered to achieve the most precise photometric measurements. In this paper,\nwe examine such systematic chromatic errors using photometry from the Dark\nEnergy Survey (DES) as an example. We define a natural magnitude system for DES\nand calculate the systematic errors on stellar magnitudes, when the atmospheric\ntransmission and instrumental throughput deviate from the natural system. We\nconclude that the systematic chromatic errors caused by the change of airmass\nin each exposure, the change of the precipitable water vapor and aerosol in the\natmosphere over time, and the non-uniformity of instrumental throughput over\nthe focal plane, can be up to 2% in some bandpasses. We compare the calculated\nsystematic chromatic errors with the observed DES data. For the test sample\ndata, we correct these errors using measurements of the atmospheric\ntransmission and instrumental throughput. The residual after correction is less\nthan 0.3%.

The model implies that bodies scattered\noutward by Neptune to semimajor axes a>50 au often evolve into resonances which\nsubsequently act to raise the perihelion distances of orbits to q>40 au. The\nimplication of the model is that the orbits with 50<a<100 au and q>40 au should\ncluster near (but not in) the resonances with Neptune (3:1 at a=62.6 au, 4:1 at\na=75.9 au, 5:1 at a=88.0 au, etc.).

However, we show that the\namplitude of this effect depends on the definition of halo age: assembly bias\nis significantly reduced when removing the effects of splashback halos---those\nhalos that are central but have passed through a larger halo or experienced\nstrong tidal encounters. Defining age using halo mass at its peak value rather\nthan current mass removes these effects. In SDSS data, at M$_{\\rm gal}\\gtrsim\n10^{10.0}$ M_sol/h$^2$, there is a $\\sim 5\\%$ increase in $f_Q$ from low to\nhigh densities, which is in agreement with predictions of dark matter halos\nusing peak halo mass. At lower stellar mass there is little to no correlation\nof $f_Q$ with $\\rho$. For these galaxies, age-matching is inconsistent with the\ndata across the wide range the halo formation metrics that we tested. This\nimplies that halo formation history has a small but statistically significant\nimpact on quenching of star formation at high masses, while the quenching\nprocess in low-mass central galaxies is uncorrelated with halo formation\nhistory. \n\n"}

Motivated by the evidence for powerful\nradiative shocks within nova outflows, we propose that dust formation occurs\nwithin the cool, dense shell behind these shocks. We incorporate a simple\nmolecular chemistry network and classical nucleation theory with a model for\nthe thermodynamic evolution of the post-shock gas, in order to demonstrate the\nformation of both carbon and forsterite ($\\rm Mg_2SiO_4$) grains. The high\ndensities due to radiative shock compression ($n \\sim 10^{14}$ cm$^{-3}$)\nresult in CO saturation and rapid dust nucleation. Grains grow efficiently to\nlarge sizes $\\gtrsim 0.1\\mu$m, in agreement with IR observations of\ndust-producing novae, and with total dust masses sufficient to explain massive\nextinction events such as V705 Cas.

A number of\ncorrelations between the DRW model parameters, the signal decorrelation\ntimescale and amplitude, and the physical AGN parameters such as the black hole\nmass or luminosity have been reported. Aims: We are interested in whether it is\nplausible to correctly measure the DRW parameters from a typical ground-based\nsurvey, in particular how accurate the recovered DRW parameters are compared to\nthe input ones. Methods: By means of Monte Carlo simulations of AGN light\ncurves, we study the impact of the light curve length, the source magnitude,\ncadence, and additional light on the DRW model parameters. Results: The most\nsignificant finding is that currently existing surveys are going to return\nunconstrained DRW decorrelation timescales, because typical rest-frame data do\nnot probe long enough timescales or the white noise part of PSD for DRW. The\nexperiment length must be at least ten times longer than the true DRW\ntimescale, being presumably in the vicinity of one year, meaning a minimum\n10-years-long AGN light curves (rest-frame). The DRW timescales for\nsufficiently long light curves are typically weakly biased, and the exact bias\ndepends on the fitting method and used priors. The DRW amplitude is mostly\naffected by the photometric noise (so the source magnitude or the\nsignal-to-noise ratio), cadence, and the AGN host light. Conclusions: Because\nthe DRW parameters appear to be incorrectly determined from typically existing\ndata, the reported correlations of the DRW variability and physical AGN\nparameters from other works seem unlikely to be correct. In particular, the\nanti-correlation of the DRW timescale with redshift is a manifestation of the\nsurvey length being too short.

Hopkins & Lee (2016) directly simulated\nthe dynamics of neutral dust grains in super-sonic MHD turbulence, typical of\nGMCs, and showed that the dust-to-gas fluctuations can exceed factor ~1000 on\nsmall scales, with important implications for star formation, stellar\nabundances, and dust behavior and growth. However, even in primarily neutral\ngas in GMCs, dust grains are negatively charged and Lorentz forces are\nnon-negligible. Therefore, we extend our previous study by including the\neffects of Lorentz forces on charged grains (in addition to drag). For small\ncharged grains (sizes <0.1 micron), Lorentz forces suppress dust-to-gas ratio\nfluctuations, while for large grains (sizes >1 micron), Lorentz forces have\nessentially no effect, trends that are well explained with a simple theory of\ndust magnetization. In some special intermediate cases, Lorentz forces can\nenhance dust-gas segregation. Regardless, for the physically expected scaling\nof dust charge with grain size, we find the most important effects depend on\ngrain size (via the drag equation) with Lorentz forces/charge as a second-order\ncorrection.

We focus on the regime where the local thermal\ntimescale is shorter than the dynamical timescale, corresponding to inefficient\nconvective energy transport. We begin with initially weak magnetic fields\nrelative to the thermal pressure, from 100-1000G in differing geometries. The\nunstable density inversion amplifies the magnetic field, increasing the\nmagnetic energy density to values close to equipartition with the turbulent\nkinetic energy density. By providing pressure support, the magnetic field's\npresence significantly increases the density fluctuations in the turbulent\nenvelope, thereby enhancing the radiative energy transport by allowing photons\nto diffuse out through low density regions. Magnetic buoyancy brings small\nscale magnetic fields to the photosphere and increases the vertical energy\ntransport with the energy advection velocity proportional to the Alfv\\'en\nvelocity, although in all cases we study photon diffusion still dominates the\nenergy transport.

The presence of noise in\nobserved images makes deconvolution a nontrivial task that necessitates the use\nof regularisation. This task is particularly difficult when the PSF varies\nspatially as is the case for the Euclid telescope. New surveys will provide\nimages containing thousand of galaxies and the deconvolution regularisation\nproblem can be considered from a completely new perspective. In fact, one can\nassume that galaxies belong to a low-rank dimensional space. This work\nintroduces the use of the low-rank matrix approximation as a regularisation\nprior for galaxy image deconvolution and compares its performance with a\nstandard sparse regularisation technique.

Therefore, multi-messenger connections are generally\nimportant for the indirect searches of dark matters. The recent development of\n$\\gamma$-ray astronomy puts stringent constraints on the properties of dark\nmatter, especially by observations with the Fermi $\\gamma$-ray satellite in the\nlast several years. Motivated by the lack of $\\gamma$-ray as well as the shape\nof the neutrino spectrum observed by IceCube, we discuss a scenario in which\nthe DM is a PeV scale particle which couples strongly to other invisible\nparticles and its decay products do not contain a charged particle. As an\nexample to realize such possibilities, we consider a model of fermionic dark\nmatter that decays into a neutrino and many invisible fermions. The dark matter\ndecay is secluded in the sense that the emitted products are mostly neutrinos\nand dark fermions. One remarkable feature of this model is the resulting\nbroadband neutrino spectra around the energy scale of the dark matter. We apply\nthis model to multi-PeV dark matter, and discuss possible observable\nconsequences in light of the IceCube data. In particular, this model could\naccount for the large flux at medium energies of $\\sim10-100$ TeV, possibly as\nwell as the second peak at PeV, without violating the stringent $\\gamma$-ray\nconstraints from Fermi and air-shower experiments such as CASA-MIA. \n\n"}

In addition to the transit features created by\nthe planets, the flux also includes the reflected light component of each\nplanet, which depends on the planetary albedo. This signal is typically\nreferred to as phase curve and could be easily identified if there were no\nadditional noise. As well as instrumental noise, stellar activity, such as\nspots, can create a modulation in the data, which may be very difficult to\ndistinguish from the planetary signal. We analyze the limitations imposed by\nthe stellar activity on the detection of the planetary albedo, considering the\nlimitations imposed by the predicted level of instrumental noise and the short\nduration of the observations planned in the context of the CHEOPS mission. As\ninitial condition, we have assumed that each star is characterized by just one\norbiting planet. We built mock light curves that included a realistic stellar\nactivity pattern, the reflected light component of the planet and an\ninstrumental noise level, which we have chosen to be at the same level as\npredicted for CHEOPS. We then fit these light curves to try to recover the\nreflected light component, assuming the activity patterns can be modeled with a\nGaussian process.We estimate that at least one full stellar rotation is\nnecessary to obtain a reliable detection of the planetary albedo. This result\nis independent of the level of noise, but it depends on the limitation of the\nGaussian process to describe the stellar activity when the light curve\ntime-span is shorter than the stellar rotation.

Here we employ a Cramer--Rao (CRLB)\nor Fisher-matrix approach to understand the quantitative information content in\neleven known streams (ATLAS, GD-1, Hermus, Kwando, Orinoco, PS1A, PS1C, PS1D,\nPS1E, Sangarius and Triangulum).

We find that in simple analytic models of the Milky Way, streams on\neccentric orbits contain the most information about the halo shape. For each\nstream, there are near-degeneracies between dark-matter-halo properties and\nparameters of the bulge, the disk, and the stream progenitor, but simultaneous\nfitting of multiple streams will constrain all parameters at the percent level.\nAt this precision, simulated dark matter halos deviate from simple analytic\nparametrizations, so we add an expansion of basis functions to give the\ngravitational potential more freedom. As freedom increases, the information\nabout the halo reduces overall, and it becomes more localized to the current\nposition of the stream. In the limit of high model freedom, a stellar stream\nappears to measure the local acceleration at its current position; this\nmotivates thinking about future non-parametric approaches. The CRLB formalism\nalso permits us to assess the value of future measurements of stellar\nvelocities, distances, and proper motions.

We concentrate on radiative neutrino scattering on atomic electrons\n(or on free electrons in a conductor). Such processes can be coherent provided\nthat the net electron recoil momentum, i.e. the momentum transfer from the\nneutrino minus the momentum of the emitted photon, is sufficiently small. The\nradiative processes is an attractive possibility as the energy of the emitted\nphotons can be as large as the momentum transfer to the electron system and\ntherefore the problem of detecting extremely low energy recoils can be avoided.\nThe requirement of macroscopic coherence severely constrains the phase space\navailable for the scattered particle and the emitted photon. We show that in\nthe case of the scattering mediated by the usual weak neutral current and\ncharged current interactions this leads to a strong suppression of the\nelementary cross sections and therefore the requirement of macroscopic\ncoherence results in a reduction rather than an increase of the total detection\ncross section. However, for the $\\nu e$ scattering mediated by neutrino\nmagnetic or electric dipole moments coherence effects can actually increase the\ndetection rates. Effects of macroscopic coherence can also allow detection of\nneutrinos in 100 eV -- a few keV energy range, which is currently not\naccessible to the experiment. A similar coherent enhancement mechanism can work\nfor relativistic particles in the dark sector, but not for the conventionally\nconsidered non-relativistic dark matter. \n\n"}

Without winds, the same galaxies appear less Ly\nalpha bright as a result of both differences in the line profile emerging from\ngalaxies themselves, and, in the distributions of neutral gas in the\ncircumgalactic (CGM) and intergalactic medium (IGM). We also study the\nrelations between apparent Ly alpha luminosity and various galaxy properties:\nstellar mass, star formation rate (SFR) and host halo mass.

From this\ninvestigation, we find that during caustic crossings the fractional\namplification deviations of microlensing light curves from those of spotless\nsource events are equivalent to the deviations of single-lens events, implying\nthat spots can also be detected with a similar photometric precision to that\nrequired for spot detection by observing single-lens events.

The observed color variations might be intrinsic to the\nafterglow, or might indicate systematic errors of > 0.08 magnitude in all\nfluxes.

The DWT estimator for\nmulti-dimensional samples provides two types of spectra with respect to\ndiagonal and off-diagonal modes, which are very flexible to deal with\nconfiguration-related problems in the power spectrum detection. With simulation\nsamples and mock catalogues of the Las Campanas redshift survey (LCRS), we show\n(1) the slice-like geometry of the LCRS doesn't affect the off-diagonal power\nspectrum with ``slice-like'' mode; (2) the Poisson sampling with the LCRS\nselection function doesn't cause more than 1-$\\sigma$ error in the DWT power\nspectrum; and (3) the powers of peculiar velocity fluctuations, which cause the\nredshift distortion, are approximately scale-independent. These results insure\nthat the uncertainties of the power spectrum measurement are under control. The\nscatter of the DWT power spectra of the six strips of the LCRS survey is found\nto be rather small.

If the accretion disk is larger than a few tens or\nhundreds of Schwarzschild radii, the accretion will proceed via a\nconvection-dominated accretion flow (CDAF) in which most of the matter escapes\nto infinity rather than falling onto the black hole. Models involving the\nmergers of black hole white dwarf binaries and black hole helium star binaries\nfall in this category. These models are unlikely to produce GRBs since very\nlittle mass reaches the black hole. If the accretion disk is smaller, then\naccretion will proceed via neutrino cooling in a neutrino-dominated accretion\ndisk (NDAF) and most of the mass will reach the center. Models involving the\nmergers of double neutron star binaries and black hole neutron star binaries\nfall in this category and are capable of producing bright GRBs.

The observations include 31 short pointings made by the Unconventional\nStellar Aspect (USA) Experiment on board the Advanced Research and Global\nObservation Satellite (ARGOS), and 17 pointings by the PCA on board the Rossi\nX-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE). Most of these observations were spaced by less\nthan 1 day. \\es was detected by the ARGOS USA detector in the range 1-16 keV,\nand by the PCA in the 2-16 keV range but at different times. During the closely\nspaced RXTE observations beginning on 2000 July 28, an ending of one flare and\na start of another are visible, associated with spectral changes, where the\nphoton index Gamma ranges between ~ 1.4 and 1.7, and the spectrum is harder\nwhen the source is brighter. This implies that 1ES1959 is an XBL-type blazar,\nwith the X-ray emission likely to originate via the synchrotron process. The\nUSA observations reveal another flare that peaked on 2000 November 14 and\ndoubled the flux within a few days, again associated with spectral changes of\nthe same form. The spectral variability correlated with the flux and timing\ncharacteristics of this object that are similar to those of other nearby BL\nLacs, and suggest relativistic beaming with a Doppler factor delta > 1.6 and\nmagnetic fields of the order of a few mG. We also suggest that the steady\ncomponent of the X-ray emission -- present in this object as well as in other\nXBLs -- may be due to the large-scale relativistic jet (such as measured by\nChandra in many radio-loud AGN), but pointing very closely to our line of\nsight. \n\n"}

Their median stellar surface mass\ndensity scales with stellar mass as mu* propto M_*^0.54, suggesting that the\nstellar mass of a disk galaxy is proprtional to the three halves power of its\nhalo mass. This suggests that the efficiency of the conversion of baryons into\nstars in low mass galaxies increases in propor- tion to halo mass, perhaps as a\nresult of supernova feedback processes.

The large flux magnification by\na factor of ~ 100 provided by the gravitational lens effect combined with the\nlarge redshift (z = 3.91) of the quasar have facilitated the acquisition of the\nfirst high signal-to-noise X-ray spectrum of a quasar containing X-ray BALs.\nOur analysis of the X-ray spectrum of APM 08279+5255 places the rest-frame\nenergies of the two observed absorption lines at 8.1 and 9.8 keV.

First, it has been possible to demonstrate\nthat a large part of the electromagnetic emission observed can be interpreted\nas arising from the jet; this explains at once all spectral features and their\nvariability. Second we dwell on the concept that merging galaxies naturally\nlead to merging Black Holes. Here we emphasize two aspects: a) the torque\nexerted by the binary Black Holes carves a torus like distribution out of the\nstellar population near to the Black Hole binary; b) We consider the last\nstages of the Black Hole binary merger, taking into account the angle between\nthe spin of the primary Black Hole, and the orbital spin of the second Black\nHole. We show that the loss of orbital angular momentum is very strongly\nspin-dependent; for large angles between the two spins the angular momentum\nloss is strongly inhibited, allowing spin flip of the primary Black Hole which\npreserves a high angular momentum relative to the maximum allowed.

This implies that the Andromeda\ngalaxy possesses a substantial dark matter halo. We fit the orbit of the stream\nin different galaxy potential models. In a simple model with a composite bulge,\ndisk and halo, where the halo follows a ``universal'' profile that is\ncompressed by the formation of the baryonic components, we find that the\nkinematics of the stream require a total mass inside 125 kpc of\n7.5^(+2.5)_(-1.3) x 10^{11} M_Sun, or more than 5.4 x 10^{11} M_Sun at the 99%\nconfidence level.

The resulting orbit shows that if M32 or NGC 205 are\nconnected with the stream, they must either trail or lag the densest region of\nthe stream by more than 100 kpc. Furthermore, according to the best-fit orbit,\nthe stream passes very close to M31, causing its demise as a coherent structure\nand producing a fan of stars that will pollute the inner halo, thereby\nconfusing efforts to measure the properties of genuine halo populations.

This formula has been\nwidely used to predict the angular momentum transport between spiral arms and\nstellar bars between disks and dark-matter halos. However, this paper shows\nthat the LBK time-asymptotic limit is not appropriate because the\ncharacteristic evolution time for galaxies is too close to the relevant\ndynamical times. We demonstrate that transients, not present in the\ntime-asymptotic formula, can play a major role in the evolution for realistic\nastronomical time scales.

The\nnatural time dependence in bar-driven halo evolution causes quantitative\ndifferences in the overall torque and qualitative differences in the physical-\nand phase-space location of angular momentum transfer.

The accelerating particles maintain high Lorentz\nfactors and undergo cyclotron resonant absorption of radio emission, that\nproduces and maintains a large pitch angle, resulting in a strong synchrotron\ncomponent. The resulting spectra consist of several distinct components:\ncurvature radiation from primary electrons dominating from 1 - 100 GeV,\nsynchrotron radiation from primary and secondary electrons dominating up to\nabout 100 MeV, and much weaker inverse-Compton radiation from primary electrons\nat 0.1 - 1 TeV.

To test this conjecture,\nwe determined the size of SN 2001em. It is only marginally resolved at our\nresolution of ~0.9 mas.

This result fits in the picture we\nsuggested earlier, namely that the f> 1 Hz variability in luminous LMXBs is\nprimarily due to variations of the boundary layer luminosity. In this picture\nthe frequency resolved spectrum equals the boundary layer spectrum, which\ntherefore can be straightforwardly determnined from the data. The obtained so\nboundary layer spectrum is well approximated by the saturated Comptonization\nmodel, its high energy cut-off follows kT~2.4 keV black body. Its independence\non the global mass accretion rate lends support to the theoretical suggestion\nby Inogamov &Sunyaev (1999) that the boundary layer is radiation pressure\nsupported. With this assumption we constrain the gravity on the neutron star\nsurface and its mass and radius.

After adjusting the values of\nthe physical parameters in the model by reference to the properties of local\ngalaxies, we use it to investigate the evolution of the K-band luminosity and\ngalaxy stellar mass functions. We also calculate the volume averaged star\nformation rate density of the Universe as a function of redshift and the way in\nwhich this is apportioned amongst galaxies of different mass. The model\nrobustly predicts a substantial population of massive galaxies out to redshift\n$z\\sim 5$ and a star formation rate density which rises with increasing\nredshift in objects of all masses. Although observational data on these\nproperties have been cited as evidence for ``anti-hierarchical'' galaxy\nformation, we find that when AGN feedback is taken into account, the\nfundamentally hierachical CDM model provides a very good match to these\nobservations. \n\n"}

The present\nshort X-ray observation (PN net exposure time ~5 ks) is the first one above 2\nkeV for MCG-02-14-009. The feature can be explained by either a relativistic\niron line around either a Schwarzschild (non-rotating) or a Kerr (rotating)\nblack hole.

Both the\nSPH and no-feedback GalICS models predict a bimodal galaxy population at z=0.\nThe \"red'' sequence of gas poor, old galaxies is populated mainly by satellite\nsystems while, contrary to observations, the central galaxies of massive haloes\nlie on the \"blue'' star-forming sequence as a result of continuing hot gas\naccretion at late times. Furthermore, both models overpredict the observed\nbaryonic mass function, especially at the high mass end. In the full GalICS\nmodel, supernova-driven outflows reduce the masses of low and intermediate mass\ngalaxies by about a factor of two. AGN feedback suppresses gas cooling in large\nhaloes, producing a sharp cut-off in the baryonic mass function and moving the\ncentral galaxies of these massive haloes to the red sequence. Our results imply\nthat the observational failings of the SPH simulation and the no-feedback\nGalICS model are a consequence of missing input physics rather than\ncomputational inaccuracies, that truncating gas accretion by satellite galaxies\nautomatically produces a bimodal galaxy distribution with a red sequence, but\nthat explaining the red colours of the most massive galaxies requires a\nmechanism like AGN feedback that suppresses the accretion onto central galaxies\nin large haloes. \n\n"}

The light curve model\nfor this event predicts that the lens star should be separated from the source\nstar by ~6mas at the time of the HST images. If the lens star is a late G, K or\nearly M dwarf, then it will be visible in the HST images as an additional\nsource of light that is blended with the source image. Unless the lens and\nsource have exactly the same colors, its presence will also be revealed by a\nsystematic shift between centroids of the source plus lens in different filter\nbands. The HST data indicates both of these effects: the HST source that\nmatches the position of the source star is 0.21 magnitudes brighter in the\nACS/HRC-F814W filter than the microlensing model predicts, and there is an\noffset of ~0.7mas between the centroid of this source in the F814W and F435W\nfilter bands. We conclude the planetary host star has been detected in these\nHST images, and this identification of the lens star enables a complete\nsolution of the lens system. The lens parameters are determined with a Bayesian\nanalysis, averaging over uncertainties in the measured parameters, interstellar\nextinction, and allowing for the possibility of a binary companion to the\nsource star. This yields a stellar mass of M_* = 0.63(+0.07/-0.09) M_solar and\na planet mass of M_p = 2.6 (+0.8/-0.6) M_Jup at an orbital separation of 4.3\n(+2.5/-0.8) AU. Thus, the lens system resembles our own Solar System, with a\nplanet of ~3 Jupiter-masses in a Jupiter-like orbit around a star of two-thirds\nof a Solar mass. These conclusions can be tested with future HST images, which\nshould reveal a broadening of the blended source-plus-lens point spread\nfunction due to the relative lens-source proper motion. \n\n"}

We suppose that\nthe magnetic field and the electron Lorentz factor reach large equipartition\nvalues in the shocks. Synchrotron photons emitted by the relativistic electrons\nhave a typical energy in the gamma-ray range in the observer frame. Synthetic\nbursts are constructed as the sum of the contributions from all the internal\nelementary shocks and their temporal and spectral properties are compared to\nthe observations. We reproduce the diversity of burst profiles, the ``FRED''\nshape of individual pulses and the short time scale variability.

How does this resonance affect the distribution function in the outer\nparts of a barred disk, and can we identify any effect of the resonance in the\nvelocity distribution f(v) actually observed in the solar neighborhood? To\nanswer these questions, detailed simulations of f(v) in the outer parts of an\nexponential stellar disks with nearly flat rotation curves and a rotating\ncentral bar have been performed. For a model resembling the old stellar disk,\nthe OLR causes a distinct feature in f(v) over a significant fraction of the\nouter disk. For positions <2kpc outside the OLR radius and at bar angles of\n\\~10-70 degrees, f(v) inhibits a bi-modality between the low-velocity stars\nmoving like the local standard of rest (LSR) and a secondary mode of stars\npredominantly moving outward and rotating more slowly than the LSR.\n  Such a bi-modality is indeed present in f(v) inferred from the Hipparcos data\nfor late-type stars in the solar neighborhood.

The presence of\na fundamental scale suggests that local Lorentz invariance may be violated at\nsufficiently high energies. Motivated by this possibility, recently, different\nmodels that violate Lorentz invariance locally have been used to evaluate the\ntrans-Planckian corrections to the inflationary density perturbation spectrum.\nHowever, certain astrophysical observations seem to indicate that local Lorentz\ninvariance may be preserved to extremely high energies. In such a situation, to\nstudy the trans-Planckian effects, it becomes imperative to consider models\nthat preserve local Lorentz invariance even as they contain a fundamental\nscale.

We\nassume that the initial and final stages of the background cosmological model\nare given by de Sitter and Minkowski phases, respectively, and they are\nconnected smoothly by a radiation-dominated phase. This setup allows us to\ndiscuss the quantum-mechanical generation of the perturbations and to see the\nfinal amplitude of the well-defined zero mode. Using the Wronskian formulation,\nwe numerically compute the power spectrum of gravitational waves, and find that\nthe effect of initial vacuum fluctuations in the Kaluza-Klein modes is\nsubdominant, contributing not more than 10% of the total power spectrum. Thus\nit is confirmed that the damping due to the Kaluza-Klein mode generation and\nthe enhancement due to the modification of the background Friedmann equation\nare the two dominant effects, but they cancel each other, leading to the same\nspectral tilt as the standard four-dimensional result. Kaluza-Klein gravitons\nthat escape from the brane contribute to the energy density of the dark\nradiation at late times. We show that a tiny amount of the dark radiation is\ngenerated due to this process. \n\n"}

The\nproblem is that unitarity of this gauge theory implies a strong constraint [the\n\"Strominger bound\"] on the matter fields in the bulk. We argue that the bound\nis just a reflection of the equation of state of cosmological matter. The\ndetails motivate a discussion of the possible relevance of the ``dS/CFT\ncorrespondence\" to the resolution of the Big Bang singularity. It is argued\nthat the correspondence may require the Universe to come into existence along a\nnon-singular spacelike hypersurface, as in the theories of ``creation from\nnothing\" discussed by Firouzjahi, Sarangi, and Tye, and also by Ooguri et al.\nThe argument makes use of the unusual properties of gauge theories defined on\ntopologically non-trivial spaces. \n\n"}

Parity violation in a\nstrong magnetic field could lead to an asymmetry in the neutrino radiation and\nrecoil of the newly formed neutron star. Charge conjugation violation in the\nneutrino-nucleon interaction reduces the ratio of neutrons to protons in the\nneutrino driven wind above the neutron star. This is a problem for r-process\nnucleosynthesis in this wind. On earth, parity violation is an excellent probe\nof neutrons because the weak charge of a neutron is much larger than that of a\nproton.
