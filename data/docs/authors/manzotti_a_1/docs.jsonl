Pico is a general purpose machine learning code which we have\napplied to computing the CMB power spectra and the WMAP likelihood. For this\nrelease, we have made improvements to the algorithm as well as the data sets\nused to train Pico, leading to a significant improvement in accuracy. For the 9\nparameter nonflat case presented here Pico can on average compute the TT, TE\nand EE spectra to better than 1% of cosmic standard deviation for nearly all\n$\\ell$ values over a large region of parameter space. Performing a cosmological\nparameter analysis of current CMB and large scale structure data, we show that\nthese power spectra give very accurate 1 and 2 dimensional parameter\nposteriors. We have extended Pico to allow computation of the tensor power\nspectrum and the matter transfer function. Pico runs about 1500 times faster\nthan CAMB at the default accuracy and about 250,000 times faster at high\naccuracy.

The entire population of\ncompact, high-z red galaxies may be the progenitors of the high-density cores\nof present-day ellipticals, with no need for a decrease in stellar density from\nz=2 to z=0. The primary difference between low and high-z systems is thus the\nobserved low-density material at large radii in low-z spheroids (rather than\nthe high-density material in high-z spheroids). Such low-density material may\neither (1) assemble at z<2 or (2) be present, but not yet detected, at z>2.\nMock observations of low-z massive systems show that the high-z observations do\nnot yet probe sufficiently low surface brightness material to detect the low\nsurface density 'wings' (if present).

Given that star formation takes place in gravitationally unstable gas\ndisks, it can be quenched when a disk becomes stable against fragmentation to\nbound clumps. This can result from the growth of a stellar spheroid, for\ninstance by mergers. We present the concept of morphological quenching (MQ)\nusing standard disk instability analysis, and demonstrate its natural\noccurrence in a cosmological simulation using an efficient zoom-in technique.\nWe show that the transition from a stellar disk to a spheroid can be sufficient\nto stabilize the gas disk, quench star formation, and turn an early-type galaxy\nred and dead while gas accretion continues. The turbulence necessary for disk\nstability can be stirred up by sheared perturbations within the disk in the\nabsence of bound star-forming clumps. While gas stripping processes are limited\nto dense groups and clusters, and other quenching mechanisms like AGN feedback,\nvirial shock heating and gravitational heating, are limited to halos more\nmassive than 10^12 Mo, the MQ can explain the appearance of red ellipticals\neven in less massive halos and in the field.

The\ndistribution of high-redshift quasars was recently used to constrain the power\nasymmetry on scales k ~ 1.5h/Mpc, and the upper bound on the amplitude of the\nasymmetry was found to be a factor of six smaller than the amplitude of the\nasymmetry in the CMB. We show that it is not possible to generate an asymmetry\nwith this scale dependence by changing the relative contributions of the\ninflaton and curvaton to the adiabatic power spectrum. Instead, we consider\ncurvaton scenarios in which the curvaton decays after dark matter freezes out,\nthus generating isocurvature perturbations. If there is a superhorizon\nfluctuation in the curvaton field, then the rms amplitude of these\nperturbations will be asymmetric, and the asymmetry will be most apparent on\nlarge angular scales in the CMB.

{"id": "0911.5172", "contents": "Title: Inflation-Dark Matter unified through Quantum Generation Abstract: We unify inflation and dark matter via a single scalar field phi. One of the\nmain difficulties for this unification is that between inflation and dark\nmatter one needs a successful reheating process and a long lasting period of\nradiation. Therefore the amount of energy density in the inflaton-dark matter\nfield phi must be fine tune after reheating to give dark matter. Here we show\nan alternative scheme in which the inflaton decays completely, disappearing\nentirely from the spectrum. However, at low energies, before matter-radiation\nequality, the same interaction term that leads to the inflaton decay,\nregenerates phi. An essential feature is that the transition between the\nintermediate radiation dominated to the dark matter phase is related to a\nquantum generation of the scalar field \\phi instead to purely classical\ndynamics. Thanks to this quantum transition the inflation-dark matter\nunification can take place naturally without fine tuning. The unification\nscheme presented here has three parameters, the mass of the dark matter\nparticle m_o, the inflation parameter lambda and the coupling g for the\ninflaton interaction. Phenomenology fixes the value for lambda and gives a\nconstraint between g and m_o, leaving only the mass of the dark matter particle\nm_o as a free parameter. These same three parameters lambda, m_o, g are present\nin models with inflation and a dark matter wimp particle but without\nunification. Therefore our unification scheme does not increase the number of\nparameters and it accomplishes the desired unification between inflaton and\ndark matter for free. \n\n"}

The main\nresults are: (1) On average satellites within hosts in high density\nenvironments are accreted earlier (Delta z~ 0.1$) compared to their\ncounterparts at low densities. For host masses above 5 times10^13 Msol/h this\ntrend weakens and may reverse for higher host masses; (2) The velocity\ndispersion of satellites in low density environments follows that of the host,\ni.e. no velocity bias is observed for host halos at low densities independent\nof host mass.

However,\nfull-sky map seems to be potentially more appropriate to test for Gaussianity\nof the CMB data. On the other hand, masks can induce bias in some\nnon-Gaussianity analyses.

The Y-mass relation can\nbe biased if non-equipartition effects are not properly taken into account.\nUsing a set of hydrodynamical simulations, we have calculated three potential\nsystematic biases in the Y-mass relations introduced by non-equipartition\neffects during the cross-calibration or self-calibration when using the galaxy\ncluster abundance technique to constraint cosmological parameters. We then use\na semi-analytic technique to estimate the non-equipartition effects on the\ndistribution functions of Y (Y functions) determined from the extended\nPress-Schechter theory.

OGLE LMC LPV 28579 (SAGE\nJ051306.40-690946.3) is a carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star for\nwhich we have photometry and spectra from the Spitzer SAGE and SAGE-Spec\nprograms along with UBVIJHK_s photometry. By modeling this source, we obtain a\nbaseline set of dust properties to be used in the construction of a grid of\nmodels for carbon stars. We reproduce its spectral energy distribution using a\nmixture of AmC and SiC (15% by mass). The grain sizes are distributed according\nto the KMH model. The best-fit model has an optical depth of 0.28 for the shell\nat the peak of the SiC feature, with R_in~1430 R_sun or 4.4 R_star. The\ntemperature at this inner radius is 1310 K.

We also present a simple model for the molecular\ngas in the extended atmosphere that could give rise to the 13.7 \\mu m feature\nseen in the spectrum. We find that a combination of CO and C_2H_2 gas at an\nexcitation temperature of about 1000 K and column densities of 3x10^21 cm^-2\nand 10^19 cm^-2 respectively are able to reproduce the observations.

This simple test is\ncomplicated by the fact that Lyman-alpha emission can also be affected by the\nevolving astrophysical details of the host galaxies. In the first paper in this\nseries, we demonstrated both a luminosity and redshift dependent trend in the\nfraction of Lyman-alpha emitters seen within color-selected Lyman-break\ngalaxies (LBGs) over the range 3<z<6; lower luminosity galaxies and those at\nhigher redshift show an increased likelihood of strong emission. Here we\npresent the results from much deeper 12.5 hour exposures with the Keck DEIMOS\nspectrograph focused primarily on LBGs at z~6 which enable us to confirm the\nredshift dependence of line emission more robustly and to higher redshift than\nwas hitherto possible.

One\nspecific complication arises from derivative interactions induced by the\ncurvilinear trajectory of the inflaton in a multi-dimensional field space. In\nthis work we compute the power spectrum in general multi-field models and show\nthat certain inflaton trajectories may lead to observationally significant\nimprints of `heavy' physics in the primordial power spectrum if the inflaton\ntrajectory turns, that is, traverses a bend, sufficiently fast (without\ninterrupting slow roll), even in cases where the normal modes have masses\napproaching the cutoff of our theory. We emphasise that turning is defined with\nrespect to the geodesics of the sigma model metric, irrespective of whether\nthis is canonical or non-trivial. The imprints generically take the form of\ndamped superimposed oscillations on the power spectrum. In the particular case\nof two-field models, if one of the fields is sufficiently massive compared to\nthe scale of inflation, we are able to compute an effective low energy theory\nfor the adiabatic mode encapsulating certain relevant operators of the full\nmulti-field dynamics. As expected, a particular characteristic of this\neffective theory is a modified speed of sound for the adiabatic mode which is a\nfunctional of the background inflaton trajectory and the turns traversed during\ninflation.

The approach employs a\ndirect discretisation of the radiative transfer equation in Boltzmann form with\nadjustable angular resolution that in principle works equally well in the\noptically thin and optically thick regimes. In our most general formulation of\nthe scheme, the local radiation field is decomposed into a linear sum of\ndirectional bins of equal solid-angle, tessellating the unit sphere. Each of\nthese \"cone-fields\" is transported independently, with constant intensity as a\nfunction of direction within the cone. Photons propagate at the speed of light\n(or optionally using a reduced speed of light approximation to allow larger\ntimesteps), yielding a fully time-dependent solution of the radiative transfer\nequation that can naturally cope with an arbitrary number of sources, as well\nas with scattering.

The amplitude of the dipole\ncorrelates with cluster properties, being larger for the most X-ray luminous\nclusters, as required if the signal is produced by the SZ effect. Since it is\nmeasured at zero monopole, the dipole can not be due to the thermal SZ effect.\nOur results are consistent with those obtained earlier by us from 5-yr WMAP\ndata and using a proprietary cluster catalog. In addition, they are robust to\nquadrupole removal, demonstrating that quadrupole leakage contributes\nnegligibly to the signal. The lower noise of the 7-yr WMAP also allows us, for\nthe first time, to obtain tentative empirical confirmation of our earlier\nconjecture that the adopted filtering flips the sign of the KSZ effect for\nrealistic clusters and thus of the deduced direction of the flow. The latter is\nconsistent with our earlier measurement in both the amplitude and direction.\nAssuming the filtering indeed flips the sign of the KSZ effect from the\nclusters, the direction agrees well also with the results of independent work\nusing galaxies as tracers at lower distances.

The GC surface density profile\naround the central massive elliptical galaxy, NGC 4874, is dominated at large\nradii by a population of IGCs that extend to the limit of our data (R<520 kpc).\nWe estimate that there are 47000+/-1600 (random) +4000/-5000 (systematic) IGCs\nout to this radius, and that they make up ~70% of the central GC system, making\nthis the largest GC system in the nearby Universe. Even including the GC\nsystems of other cluster galaxies, IGCs still make up ~30-45% of the GCs in the\ncluster core. Observational limits from previous studies of the intracluster\nlight (ICL) suggest that the IGC population has a high specific frequency. If\nthe IGC population has a specific frequency similar to high-S_N dwarf galaxies,\nthen the ICL has a total stellar mass of ~10^12 M_sun within the cluster core.\nThe ICL makes up approximately half of the stellar luminosity and one-third of\nthe stellar mass of the central (NGC4874+ICL) system. The color distribution of\nthe IGC population is bimodal, with blue, metal-poor GCs outnumbering red,\nmetal-rich GCs by a ratio of 4:1.

Previous work has demonstrated that the black hole\nspins can have a strong impact on the accuracy of parameter measurement.\nRelativistic spin-induced precession modulates the waveform in a manner which\ncan break degeneracies between parameters, in principle significantly improving\nhow well they are measured. Recent studies have indicated, however, that spin\nprecession may be weak for an important subset of astrophysical binary black\nholes: those in which the spins are aligned due to interactions with gas. In\nthis paper, we examine how well a binary's parameters can be measured when its\nspins are partially aligned and compare results using waveforms that include\nhigher post-Newtonian harmonics to those that are truncated at leading\nquadrupole order. We find that the weakened precession can substantially\ndegrade parameter estimation. This degradation is particularly devastating for\nthe extrinsic parameters sky position and distance. Absent higher harmonics,\nLISA typically localizes the sky position of a nearly aligned binary a factor\nof $\\sim 6$ less accurately than for one in which the spin orientations are\nrandom.

We perform the same analysis in the CDFS\nwhere excellent quality chandra (4 Ms) and xmm (3 Ms) X-ray spectra are\navailable. We derive accurate X-ray luminosities for chandra sources using\nX-ray spectral fits, as well as 6mu luminosities from SED fits.

One of these sources has been\nalready demonstrated to host a CT nucleus, while for another one at a redshift\nof z=1.22 we argue it is most likely CT on the basis of its combined chandra\nand xmm spectrum. We find a large number of non CT contaminant with low Lx/L6\nratios. The above suggest that a low Lx/L6 ratio alone cannot ascertain the\npresence of a CT AGN, albeit the majority of low Lx/L6 AGN are heavily\nobscured.

This is achieved by summarizing the efficiencies of\naccretion, cooling, star formation, and feedback given by the HYD, as functions\nof the halo mass and redshift. Surprisingly, by turning the HYD into a SAM, we\nconserve the mass of individual galaxies, with deviations at the level of 0.1\ndex, on an object-by-object basis. This is true for all redshifts, and for the\nmass of stars and gas components, although the agreement reaches 0.2 dex for\nsatellite galaxies at low redshift. We show that the same level of accuracy is\nobtained even in case the SAM uses only one phase of gas within each galaxy.\nMoreover, we demonstrate that the formation history of one massive galaxy\nprovides sufficient information for the SAM to reproduce the population of\ngalaxies within the entire cosmological box. The reasons for the small scatter\nbetween the HYD and SAM galaxies are: a) The efficiencies are matched as\nfunctions of the halo mass and redshift, meaning that the evolution within\nmerger-trees agrees on average. b) For a given galaxy, efficiencies fluctuate\naround the mean value on time scales of 0.2-2 Gyr. c) The various mass\ncomponents of galaxies are obtained by integrating the efficiencies over time,\naveraging out these fluctuations. We compare the efficiencies found here to\nstandard SAM recipes and find that they often deviate significantly. For\nexample, here the HYD shows smooth accretion that is less effective for low\nmass haloes, and is always composed of hot or dilute gas; cooling is less\neffective at high redshift; and star formation changes only mildly with cosmic\ntime. The method developed here can be applied in general to any HYD, and can\nthus serve as a common language for both HYDs and SAM (Abridged). \n\n"}

For some of the galaxies where the optical (g-z)\ndistribution is clearly bimodal, the (g-K) and (z-K) distributions are better\ndescribed by a unimodal distribution. The two most cluster-rich galaxies in our\nsample, NGC4486 and NGC4649, show some interesting differences.

We parametrize the initial state modifications and\nidentify certain choices of parameters as natural, though we also note some\nfine-tuned choices that can yield a larger bispectrum. In both cases, we\nobserve a distinctive k^-3 signature in LSS (as opposed to k^-2 for the\nlocal-form).

The long-duration gravitational-waveforms emitted\nby such systems encode the structure of the strong field region of the massive\nblack hole, in which the inspiral occurs. The detection and analysis of EMRIs\nwill therefore allow us to study the geometry of massive black holes and\ndetermine whether their nature is as predicted by General Relativity and even\nto test whether General Relativity is the correct theory to describe the\ndynamics of these systems. To achieve this, EMRI modeling in alternative\ntheories of gravity is required to describe the generation of gravitational\nwaves. In this paper, we explore to what extent EMRI observations with LISA or\neLISA/NGO might be able to distinguish between General Relativity and a\nparticular modification of it, known as Dynamical Chern-Simons Modified\nGravity. Our analysis is based on a parameter estimation study that uses\napproximate gravitational waveforms obtained via a radiative-adiabatic method\nand is restricted to a five-dimensional subspace of the EMRI configuration\nspace. This includes a Chern-Simons parameter that controls the strength of\ngravitational deviations from General Relativity. We find that, if Dynamical\nChern-Simons Modified Gravity is the correct theory, an observatory like LISA\nor even eLISA/NGO should be able to measure the Chern-Simons parameter with\nfractional errors below 5%. If General Relativity is the true theory, these\nobservatories should put bounds on this parameter at the level xi^(1/4) < 10^4\nkm, which is four orders of magnitude better than current Solar System bounds. \n\n"}

The gas in\nthese galaxies is not in perfect hydrostatic equilibrium. Supernova feedback,\nstellar winds, or active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback can significantly\nperturb the interstellar medium (ISM). Using hydrodynamical simulations, we\ninvestigate the effect of subsonic turbulence in the hot ISM on the ram\npressure stripping process in early-type galaxies. We find that galaxies with\nmore turbulent ISM produce longer, wider, and more smoothly distributed tails\nof the stripped ISM than those characterised by weaker ISM turbulence. Our main\nconclusion is that even very weak internal turbulence, at the level of <15% of\nthe average ISM sound speed, can significantly accelerate the gas removal from\ngalaxies via ram pressure stripping. The magnitude of this effect increases\nsharply with the strength of turbulence. As most of the gas stripping takes\nplace near the boundary between the ISM and the intraclustermedium (ICM), the\nboost in the ISM stripping rate is due to the \"random walk\" of the ISM from the\ncentral regions of the galactic potential well to larger distances, where the\nram pressure is able to permanently remove the gas from galaxies.

In case the vector\nfield survives after the reheating, both the primordial scalar and tensor\nfluctuations can be enhanced by the anisotropic stress composed of the vector\nfields during radiation dominated era.

Comparing the analytical\nresults with a large suite of N-body simulations (160 independent boxes of 13.8\n(Gpc/h)^3 volume each, which are publicly available), we find that re-summing\nterms in the standard perturbative approach predicts the real-space matter\npower spectrum with an accuracy of < 2% for k < 0.20 h/Mpc at redshifts z <\n1.5. This is obtained following the widespread technique of writing the\nresummed propagator in terms of 1-loop contributions. We show that the accuracy\nof this scheme increases by considering higher-order terms in the resummed\npropagator. By combining resummed perturbation theories with several models for\nthe mappings from real to redshift space discussed in the literature, the\nmultipoles of the dark-matter power spectrum can be described with sub-percent\ndeviations from N-body results for k < 0.15h/Mpc at z < 1.

The aim here\nis to exploit EVLA imaging at 8.4 GHz to establish the QSOs as radio/sub-mm\nsources. The challenge in reducing the EVLA data was the presence of a strong\n4C source in the field. A new calibration algorithm was applied to the data to\nsubtract it. The resulting thermal noise limited radio map covers the 16'x16'\nExtended WHDF.

The radio observations show that the absorbed AGN\nwith LABOCA detections are coincident with radio sources, confirming the\ntendency for X-ray absorbed AGN to be sub-mm bright. These sources show strong\nultraviolet excess (UVX) suggesting the nuclear sightline is gas- but not\ndust-absorbed. Of the 3 remaining LABOCA sources within the ~5' half-power beam\nwidth, 1 is identified with a faint nuclear X-ray/radio source in a nearby\ngalaxy, 1 with a faint radio source and 1 is unidentified in any other band.\n  More generally, differential radio source counts are in good agreement with\nprevious observations, showing at S<50 micro-Jy a significant excess over a\npure AGN model.

In contrast, the simulations with metal\nline cooling and otherwise similar feedback and star formation produced\ngalaxies with the peaked rotation curves typical of most previous LCDM\nsimulations of spiral galaxies. The less-massive bulges and non-peaked rotation\ncurves in the galaxies simulated with primordial cooling or H_2 are linked to\nchanges in the angular momentum distribution of the baryons. These galaxies had\nsmaller amounts of low-angular momentum baryons because of increased gas loss\nfrom stellar feedback.

The model fit also implies that the age of the universe is\n13.772+/-0.059 Gyr, and the fit Hubble constant is H0 = 69.32+/-0.80 km/s/Mpc.\nInflation is also supported: the fluctuations are adiabatic, with Gaussian\nrandom phases; the detection of a deviation of the scalar spectral index from\nunity reported earlier by WMAP now has high statistical significance (n_s =\n0.9608+/-0.0080); and the universe is close to flat/Euclidean, Omega_k =\n-0.0027 (+0.0039/-0.0038). Overall, the WMAP mission has resulted in a\nreduction of the cosmological parameter volume by a factor of 68,000 for the\nstandard six-parameter LCDM model, based on CMB data alone. For a model\nincluding tensors, the allowed seven-parameter volume has been reduced by a\nfactor 117,000.

Vacuum and non-vacuum solutions for\n  massive gravity Abstract: Massive gravity is a theory which has a tremendous amount of freedom to\ndescribe different cosmologies; but at the same time the various solutions one\nencounters must fulfill some rather nontrivial constraints. Most of the freedom\ncomes not from the Lagrangian, which contains only a small number of free\nparameters (typically 3 depending on counting conventions), but from the fact\nthat one is in principle free to choose the background reference metric almost\narbitrarily --- which effectively introduces a non-denumerable infinity of free\nparameters. In the current paper we stress that although changing the reference\nmetric would lead to a different cosmological model, this does not mean that\nthe dynamics of the universe can be entirely divorced from its matter content.\nThat is, while the choice of reference metric certainly influences the\nevolution of the physically observable foreground metric, the effect of matter\ncannot be neglected. Nevertheless, the relation between matter and geometry can\nbe significantly changed in some specific models; effectively since the\ngraviton would be able to curve the spacetime by itself, without the need of\nmatter.

Instead of\ninvoking ad hoc correlations between the various components, the system of\nscalar inhomogeneities is diagonalized in terms of two gauge-invariant\nquasi-normal modes whose weighted sum gives the curvature perturbations on\ncomoving orthogonal hypersurfaces. The predominance of the conventional\nadiabatic scalar mode implies that the growth rate of magnetized\ninhomogeneities must not exceed 2.2 in Hubble units if the conventional\ninflationary phase is to last about 70 efolds and for a range of slow roll\nparameters between 0.1 and 0.001.

It is well known that the\ndistribution function of relativistic particles is one-dimensional at the\npulsar surface. However, cyclotron instability causes an appearance of\ntransverse momenta of relativistic electrons, which as a result, start to\nradiate in the synchrotron regime. On the basis of the Vlasov's kinetic\nequation we study the process of the quasi-linear diffusion (QLD) developed by\nmeans of the cyclotron instability. This mechanism provides generation of\noptical and X-ray emission on the light cylinder lengthscales. The analysis of\nthe three archival XMM-Newton observations of RX J0420.0-5022 is performed.\nConsidering a different approach of the synchrotron emission theory, the\nspectral energy distribution is obtained that is in a good agreement with the\nobservational data.

An empirical modeling approach (2-SFM) which\ndistinguishes between the main sequence and rarer starburst galaxies is capable\nof reproducing most statistical properties of infrared galaxies. In this paper,\nwe extend this approach by establishing a connection between stellar mass and\nhalo mass with the technique of abundance matching. Based on a few, simple\nassumptions and a physically motivated formalism, our model successfully\npredicts the (cross-)power spectra of the cosmic infrared background (CIB), the\ncross-correlation between CIB and cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing,\nand the correlation functions of bright, resolved infrared galaxies measured by\nHerschel, Planck, ACT and SPT. We use this model to infer the redshift\ndistribution these observables, as well as the level of correlation between\nCIB-anisotropies at different wavelengths. We also predict that more than 90%\nof cosmic star formation activity occurs in halos with masses between 10^11.5\nand 10^13.5 Msun. Taking into account subsequent mass growth of halos, this\nimplies that the majority of stars were initially (at z>3) formed in the\nprogenitors of clusters, then in groups at 0.5<z<3 and finally in\nMilky-Way-like halos at z<0.5. At all redshifts, the dominant contribution to\nthe star formation rate density stems from halos of mass ~10^12 Msun, in which\nthe instantaneous star formation efficiency is maximal (~70%). The strong\nredshift-evolution of SFR in the galaxies that dominate the CIB is thus\nplausibly driven by increased accretion from the cosmic web onto halos of this\ncharacteristic mass scale.

Squeezing of primordial quantum\nfluctuations along with the mechanism of decoherence accounts for many aspects\nof this quantum to classical transition, although it remains a matter of debate\nas to whether this is sufficient to explain the issue of realization of a\nsingle outcome (i.e. the issue of macro-objectification) from a quantum\nensemble given that the universe is a closed system.

Our analysis shows a tendency for\nthe clustering strength to decrease with limiting fluxes: r0(S100um >8 mJy)~4.3\nMpc and r0(S100um >5 mJy)~5.8 Mpc. These values convert into minimum halo\nmasses Mmin~10^{11.6} Msun for sources brighter than 8 mJy and Mmin~10^{12.4}\nMsun for S100um > 5 mJy galaxies. We show such an increase of the clustering\nstrength to be due to an intervening population of z~2 sources, which are very\nstrongly clustered and whose relative contribution, equal to about 10% of the\ntotal counts at S100um > 2 mJy, rapidly decreases for brighter flux cuts. By\nremoving such a contribution, we find that z <~ 1 FIR galaxies have\napproximately the same clustering properties, irrespective of their flux level.\nThe above results were then used to investigate the intrinsic dependence on\ncosmic epoch of the clustering strength of dusty star-forming galaxies between\nz~0 and z~2.5.

First, the gas density\nnear the ionization front is 7x10^4 L_{i,45} r_{50}^{-2} cm^{-3}, where\nL_{i,45} is the ionizing luminosity in units of 10^45 erg/s and r_{50} is the\ndistance of the gas from the nucleus in units of 50 pc. Second, as shown by\nDopita et al., the solution of the ionization structure within each slab is\nunique, independent of the ambient pressure. We show that the RPC density vs.\ndistance relation is observed over a dynamical range of ~10^4 in distance, from\nsub-pc to kpc from the nucleus, and a range of ~10^8 in gas density, from 10^3\nto 10^11 cm^{-3}. This relation implies that the radiative force of luminous\nAGN can compress giant molecular clouds in the host galaxy, and possibly affect\nthe star formation rate.

In our semi-analytic model implementation, the flips\nseen the dark matter haloes are assumed to be the same for the cold baryons;\nhowever, we also assume that in the latter the flip also entails a difficulty\nfor the disc to increase its angular momentum which causes the disc to become\nsmaller relative to a no-flip case.

During the transition from clumpy to spiral disks, two unusual types\nof spirals are found in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field that are massive, clumpy\nand irregular like their predecessor clumpy disks, yet spiral-like or sheared\nlike their descendants. One type is ``woolly'' with massive clumpy arms all\nover the disk and is brighter than other disk galaxies at the same redshift,\nwhile another type has irregular multiple arms with high pitch angles, star\nformation knots and no inner symmetry like today's multiple-arm galaxies. The\ncommon types of spirals seen locally are also present in a redshift range\naround z~1, namely grand design with two symmetric arms, multiple arm with\nsymmetry in the inner parts and several long, thin arms in the outer parts, and\nflocculent, with short, irregular and patchy arms that are mostly from star\nformation.

This symmetry, which\ncan be interpreted as space-time parity, connects each ordinary particle ($e, \\\n\\nu, \\ p, \\ n, \\ \\gamma, ....)$ with a mirror partner ($e', \\ \\nu', \\ p', \\ n',\n\\ \\gamma', ...)$.

At sufficiently\nlarge scales such as the BAO scale, a standard approach for the bias problem on\nthe basis of the perturbation theory (PT) is to assume the `local bias' model\nin which the density field of biased tracers is deterministically expanded in\nterms of matter density field at the same position. The higher-order bias\nparameters are then determined by combining the power spectrum with\nhigher-order statistics such as the bispectrum. As is pointed out by recent\nstudies, however, nonlinear gravitational evolution naturally induces nonlocal\nbias terms even if initially starting only with purely local bias. As a matter\nof fact, previous works showed that the second-order nonlocal bias term, which\ncorresponds to the gravitational tidal field, is important to explain the\ncharacteristic scale-dependence of the bispectrum. In this paper we extend the\nnonlocal bias term up to third order, and investigate whether the PT-based\nmodel including nonlocal bias terms can simultaneously explain the power\nspectrum and the bispectrum of simulated halos in $N$-body simulations. We show\nthat the power spectrum, including density and momentum, and the bispectrum\nbetween halo and matter in $N$-body simulations can be simultaneously well\nexplained by the model including up to third-order nonlocal bias terms up to\nk~0.1h/Mpc. Also, the results seem in a good agreement with theoretical\npredictions of a simple coevolution picture, although the agreement is not\nperfect. These demonstration clearly shows a failure of the local bias model\neven at such large scales, and we conclude that nonlocal bias terms should be\nconsistently included in order to model statistics of halos.

In the flavor-space locked configuration, the electric and magnetic\nfields of each flavor are parallel and mutually orthogonal to other flavors,\nwith isotropic and homogeneous stress-energy. Due to the non-Abelian coupling,\nthe gauge field breaks the symmetry between left- and right-circularly\npolarized gravitational waves. This broken chiral symmetry results in a unique\nsignal: non-zero cross correlation of the cosmic microwave background\ntemperature and polarization, $TB$ and $EB$, both of which should be zero in\nthe standard, chiral symmetric case.

The high satellite quenched fraction observed in the Local Group\ndemands an extremely short quenching timescale (~ 2 Gyr) for dwarf satellites\nin the mass range Mstar ~ 10^6-10^8 Msun. This quenching timescale is\nsignificantly shorter than that required to explain the quenched fraction of\nmore massive satellites (~ 8 Gyr), both in the Local Group and in more massive\nhost halos, suggesting a dramatic change in the dominant satellite quenching\nmechanism at Mstar < 10^8 Msun. Combining our work with the results of\ncomplementary analyses in the literature, we conclude that the suppression of\nstar formation in massive satellites (Mstar ~ 10^8 - 10^11 Msun) is broadly\nconsistent with being driven by starvation, such that the satellite quenching\ntimescale corresponds to the cold gas depletion time.

The DM and MOND components have a common origin, representing different\nphases of a single underlying substance. DM consists of axion-like particles\nwith mass of order eV and strong self-interactions. The condensate has a\npolytropic equation of state P~rho^3 giving rise to a superfluid core within\ngalaxies. Instead of behaving as individual collisionless particles, the DM\nsuperfluid is more aptly described as collective excitations. Superfluid\nphonons, in particular, are assumed to be governed by a MOND-like effective\naction and mediate a MONDian acceleration between baryonic matter particles.\nOur framework naturally distinguishes between galaxies (where MOND is\nsuccessful) and galaxy clusters (where MOND is not): due to the higher velocity\ndispersion in clusters, and correspondingly higher temperature, the DM in\nclusters is either in a mixture of superfluid and normal phase, or fully in the\nnormal phase.

Steady solutions of the dynamical system\nwhich governs the evolution of the helical modes are determined, and a\nstability analysis of these solutions is carried out. The interpretation of the\nanalysis is that unstable solutions lead to energy transfer between the\ninteracting modes while stable solutions do not. From this, a dependence of\npossible interscale energy and helicity transfers on the helicities of the\ninteracting modes is derived. As expected from the inverse cascade of magnetic\nhelicity in 3D MHD turbulence, mode interactions with like helicities lead to\ntransfer of energy and magnetic helicity to smaller wavenumbers. However, some\ninteractions of modes with unlike helicities also contribute to an inverse\nenergy transfer. As such, an inverse energy cascade for nonhelical magnetic\nfields is shown to be possible. Furthermore, it is found that high values of\nthe cross-helicity may have an asymmetric effect on forward and reverse\ntransfer of energy, where forward transfer is more quenched in regions of high\ncross-helicity than reverse transfer. This conforms with recent observations of\nsolar wind turbulence. For specific helical interactions the relation to dynamo\naction is established. \n\n"}

In this work, using a sample of 39 clusters\nwith accurate caustic masses at 0.1<z<0.22, we first show that the scatter\nbetween mass and richness derived from survey data is negligibly small, as\nsmall as best mass proxies.

To date, the most accurate measurements have been obtained with Type\nIa Supernovae and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, providing evidence for the\nexistence of a transition epoch at which the expansion rate changes from\ndecelerated to accelerated. However, these results have been obtained within\nthe framework of specific cosmological models that must be implicitly or\nexplicitly assumed in the measurement. It is therefore crucial to obtain\nmeasurements of the accelerated expansion of the Universe independently of\nassumptions on cosmological models. Here we exploit the unprecedented\nstatistics provided by the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) Data\nRelease 9 to provide new constraints on the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ using the\nem cosmic chronometers approach. We extract a sample of more than 130000 of the\nmost massive and passively evolving galaxies, obtaining five new\ncosmology-independent $H(z)$ measurements in the redshift range $0.3<z<0.5$,\nwith an accuracy of $\\sim$11-16\\% incorporating both statistical and systematic\nerrors.

This difference in polarization fraction\ndisappears when the dilution by the unpolarized light of the host galaxy is\naccounted for. The TeV sources show somewhat lower fractional polarization\nvariability amplitudes than the non-TeV sources. Also the fraction of sources\nwith a smaller spread in the Q/I - U/I -plane and a clumped distribution of\npoints away from the origin, possibly indicating a preferred polarization\nangle, is larger in the TeV than in the non-TeV sources. These differences\nbetween TeV and non-TeV samples seems to arise from differences between\nintermediate and high spectral peaking sources instead of the TeV detection.\nWhen the EVPA variations are studied, the rate of EVPA change is similar in\nboth samples. We detect significant EVPA rotations in both TeV and non-TeV\nsources, showing that rotations can occur in high spectral peaking BL Lac\nobjects when the monitoring cadence is dense enough. Our simulations show that\nwe cannot exclude a random walk origin for these rotations. These results\nindicate that there are no intrinsic differences in the polarization properties\nof the TeV-detected and non-TeV-detected high-energy BL Lac objects. This\nsuggests that the polarization properties are not directly related to the\nTeV-detection, but instead the TeV loudness is connected to the general flaring\nactivity, redshift, and the synchrotron peak location.

The Effective Field Theory of Large Scale\nStructures (EFTofLSS) provides a consistent framework to make predictions for\nLSS observables in the mildly non-linear regime. In this paper we focus on\nbiased tracers.

Usually, two limiting cases have been considered.\nOne is that the produced high energetic dark matter particles are quickly\nthermalized due to the elastic scattering with background radiations.

As the most comprehensive statistics, this PDF encodes all\ncosmological information of large-scale modes, therefore, could serve as the\nbasis in the LSS modelling. Following the so-called PDF-based method from\nturbulence, we write down this PDF's evolution equation, which describes the\nprobability conservation. We show that this conservation equation's\ncharacteristic curves follow the same PDF history and could be considered as an\neffective dynamics of the coarse-grained field. Unlike the EFT of LSS, which\nconceptually would work at both realization and statistics level, this\neffective dynamics is valid only statistically. However, this `statistical\nequivalence' also provides valuable insight into scale interactions at the\nstatistical level. It also enables predicting a wide variety of statistics\nbeyond the typical N-point polyspectra, including, e.g. topologies, density PDF\nand non-linear covariance matrices etc. Our formula expresses the small-scale\neffect as the ensemble average of their interactions conditional on the\nlarge-scale modes.

The Bayesian Photometric\nRedshift (BPZ) code is used to assign galaxies to four redshift bins between\nz=0.2 and 1.3, and to produce initial estimates of the lensing-weighted\nredshift distributions $n^i_{PZ}(z)$ for bin i. Accurate determination of\ncosmological parameters depends critically on knowledge of $n^i$ but is\ninsensitive to bin assignments or redshift errors for individual galaxies.

While the nonlinear exponential mapping between optical\ndepth and flux requires an infinite series of moments to calculate any\nstatistic, we show that this series can be resumed (truncating at the desired\norder in the linear matter overdensity). We focus on the $z=2-3$ line-of-sight\npower spectrum. Our model finds that 1-absorber term dominates the power on all\nscales, with most of its contribution coming from HI columns of\n$10^{14}-10^{15}\\;\\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$, while the smaller 2-absorber contribution\ncomes from lower columns that trace overdensities of a few. The prominence of\nthe 1-absorber correlations indicates that the line-of-sight power spectrum is\nshaped principally by the lines' number densities and their absorption\nprofiles, with correlations between lines contributing to a lesser extent. We\npresent intuitive formulae for the effective optical depth as well as the\nlarge-scale limits of 1-absorber and 2-absorber terms, which simplify to\nintegrals over the HI column density distribution with different\nequivalent-width weightings. With minimalist models for the bias of absorption\nsystems and their peculiar velocity broadening, our model predicts values for\nthe density bias and velocity gradient bias that are consistent with those\nfound in simulations. \n\n"}

The extraction of the neutrino mass\nordering is a data-driven field expected to evolve very rapidly in the next\ndecade. In this review, we both analyze the present status and describe the\nphysics of subsequent prospects. Firstly, the different current available tools\nto measure the neutrino mass ordering are described. Namely, reactor,\nlong-baseline (accelerator and atmospheric) neutrino beams, laboratory searches\nfor beta and neutrinoless double beta decays and observations of the cosmic\nbackground radiation and the large scale structure of the universe are\ncarefully reviewed.

However, the\ninformation capacity of the discarded variables will inevitably change as the\nuniverse expands, generating \"quantum bias\" (QB) in the Friedmann equations\n[Phys. Lett.

This is not fast enough to form galaxies and to account for the\nobserved present-day inhomogeneities. This problem is usually resolved by\nassuming that at the recombination epoch the baryons settle down in the\npotential well of the dark matter previously assembled during the radiation era\nof the universe. This view is challenged in the present paper by using the\nrecently proposed model of a scale-invariant framework for cosmology that\nenlarges the invariance group subtending the theory of the gravitation.\n  From the continuity equation, the Euler and Poisson equations written in the\nscale-invariant framework, the equation governing the growth of the density\nfluctuations is obtained.

The interaction between 0-form (scalar field\n$\\phi$) and 3-form fields gives rise to an effective potential $V_{\\rm\neff}(\\phi)$ for the former after integrating out the contribution of the\nlatter. We explore the dynamics of inflation on an anisotropic cosmological\nbackground for a coupled system of 0-, 1-, and 2-forms.

If 1- and 2-forms are coupled to each other, we show the\nexistence of a new class of anisotropic inflationary solutions in which the\nenergy density of 2-form is sustained by that of 1-form through their\ninteractions. Our general analytic formulas for the anisotropic shear are also\nconfirmed by the numerical analysis for a concrete inflaton potential. \n\n"}

One of the possible explanation requires that\nthe baryons were much cooler than the standard scenario. This requires an\ninteraction between the dark and baryonic sectors with some appropriate\ncross-section, $ \\hat{\\sigma} $. In this work, we examine the role that\ndissipative effects of cosmic fluid might play in influencing the 21 cm signal.\nWe show that the presence of viscous dissipation of dark matter can\nsignificantly affect the energy transfer between the baryonic and dark matter\nfluids. It is demonstrated that the inclusion of the dissipative mechanism in\nthe dark sector, strongly modify the earlier constraints on dark matter mass\nand $ \\hat{\\sigma} $ obtain from EDGES observation. Further, we argue that\nEDGES absorption signal can put an independent bound on dark matter viscosity\nwhich is many order of magnitude larger than the maximum viscosity allowed by\nthe structure formation. \n\n"}

Of key interest to measuring reionization's mid-stages,\nbut also increasing observational challenge, are observations at z > 7, where\nLy$\\alpha$ redshifts to near infra-red wavelengths. Here we present a search\nfor z > 7.2 Ly$\\alpha$ emission in 53 intrinsically faint Lyman Break Galaxy\ncandidates, gravitationally lensed by massive galaxy clusters, in the KMOS\nLens-Amplified Spectroscopic Survey (KLASS). With integration times of ~7-10\nhours, we detect no Ly$\\alpha$ emission with S/N>5 in our sample. We determine\nour observations to be 80% complete for 5$\\sigma$ spatially and spectrally\nunresolved emission lines with integrated line flux $>5.7\\times10^{-18}$ erg\ns$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$. We define a photometrically selected sub-sample of 29\ntargets at $z=7.9\\pm0.6$, with a median 5$\\sigma$ Ly$\\alpha$ EW limit of 58A.\nWe perform a Bayesian inference of the average intergalactic medium (IGM)\nneutral hydrogen fraction using their spectra. Our inference accounts for the\nwavelength sensitivity and incomplete redshift coverage of our observations,\nand the photometric redshift probability distribution of each target. These\nobservations, combined with samples from the literature, enable us to place a\nlower limit on the average IGM neutral hydrogen fraction of $> 0.76 \\; (68\\%),\n\\; > 0.46 \\; (95\\%)$ at z ~ 8, providing further evidence of rapid reionization\nat z~6-8.

We provide a\nlanguage for describing systematic effects which distort the observed CMB\ntemperature and polarization fields and so contaminate the B-modes. We identify\n7 types of effects, described by 11 distortion fields, and show their\nassociation with known instrumental systematics such as common mode and\ndifferential gain fluctuations, line cross-coupling, pointing errors, and\ndifferential polarized beam effects. Because of aliasing from the small-scale\nstructure in the CMB, even uncorrelated fluctuations in these effects can\naffect the large-scale B modes relevant to gravitational waves. Many of these\nproblems are greatly reduced by having an instrumental beam that resolves the\nprimary anisotropies (FWHM << 10'). To reach the ultimate goal of an\ninflationary energy scale of 3 \\times 10^{15} GeV, polarization distortion\nfluctuations must be controlled at the 10^{-2}-10^{-3} level and temperature\nleakage to the 10^{-4}-10^{-3} level depending on effect. For example pointing\nerrors must be controlled to 1.5'' rms for arcminute scale beams or a percent\nof the Gaussian beam width for larger beams; low spatial frequency differential\ngain fluctuations or line cross-coupling must be eliminated at the level of\n10^{-4} rms. \n\n"}

Thomson scattering of\ntemperature anisotropies on the last scattering surface generates a linear\npolarization pattern on the sky that can be simply read off from their\nquadrupole moments. These in turn correspond directly to the fundamental scalar\n(compressional), vector (vortical), and tensor (gravitational wave) modes of\ncosmological perturbations. We explain the origin and phenomenology of the\ngeometric distinction between these patterns in terms of the so-called electric\nand magnetic parity modes, as well as their correlation with the temperature\npattern. By its isolation of the last scattering surface and the various\nperturbation modes, the polarization provides unique information for the\nphenomenological reconstruction of the cosmological model.
