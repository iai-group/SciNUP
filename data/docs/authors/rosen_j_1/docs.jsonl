In the\nweak-noise limit, the transition time is to leading order exponential in the\npotential difference to overcome. This exponential is corrected by a prefactor\nwhich depends on the principal curvatures of the potential at the starting\nminimum and at the highest saddle crossed by an optimal transition path. The\nEyring-Kramers law, however, does not hold whenever one of these principal\ncurvatures vanishes, since it would predict a vanishing or infinite transition\ntime. We derive the correct prefactor up to multiplicative errors that tend to\none in the zero-noise limit. As an illustration, we discuss the case of a\nsymmetric pitchfork bifurcation, in which the prefactor can be expressed in\nterms of modified Bessel functions, as well as bifurcations with two vanishing\neigenvalues. The corresponding transition times are studied in a full\nneighbourhood of the bifurcation point.

The first paradox concerns the\napparent non-existence of the signature of the electron pockets in angle\nresolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). The second paradox is a clear\nsignature of a small electron pocket in quantum oscillation experiments, but no\nevidence as yet of the corresponding hole pockets of approximately double the\nfrequency of the electron pocket. This hole pockets should be present if the\nFermi surface reconstruction is due to a commensurate density wave, assuming\nthat Luttinger sum rule relating the area of the pockets and the total number\nof charge carriers holds. Here we provide possible resolutions of these\napparent paradoxes from the commensurate $d$-density wave theory. To address\nthe first paradox we have computed the ARPES spectral function subject to\ncorrelated disorder, natural to a class of experiments relevant to the\nmaterials studied in quantum oscillations. The intensity of the spectral\nfunction is significantly reduced for the electron pockets for an intermediate\nrange of disorder correlation length, and typically less than half the hole\npocket is visible, mimicking Fermi arcs. Next we show from an exact transfer\nmatrix calculation of the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillation that the usual disorder\naffects the electron pocket more significantly than the hole pocket. However,\nwhen, in addition, the scattering from vortices in the mixed state is included,\nit wipes out the frequency corresponding to the hole pocket. Thus, if we are\ncorrect, it will be necessary to do measurements at higher magnetic fields and\neven higher quality samples to recover the hole pocket frequency. \n\n"}

II.\n  Berry phase contribution Abstract: In the mixed state of a d-wave superconductor, Bogoliubov quasiparticles are\nscattered from magnetic vortices via a combination of two effects:\nAharonov-Bohm scattering due to the Berry phase acquired by a quasiparticle\nupon circling a vortex, and effective potential scattering due to the superflow\nswirling about the vortices. In this paper, we consider the Berry phase\ncontribution in the absence of superflow, which results in branch cuts between\nneighboring vortices across which the quasiparticle wave function changes sign.\nHere, the simplest problem that captures the physics is that of scattering from\na single finite branch cut that stretches between two vortices. Elliptical\ncoordinates are natural for this two-center problem, and we proceed by\nseparating the massless Dirac equation in elliptical coordinates. The separated\nequations take the form of the Whittaker-Hill equations, which we solve to\nobtain radial and angular eigenfunctions. With these eigenfunctions in hand, we\nconstruct the scattering cross section via partial wave analysis. We discuss\nthe scattering effect of Berry phase in the absence of superflow, having\nconsidered the superflow effect in the absence of Berry phase in a separate\npaper. We also provide qualitative comparison of transport cross sections for\nthe Berry phase and the Superflow effects.

A player seeks to activate $K \\geq 1$ arms at each time in\norder to maximize the expected total reward obtained over multiple plays. RMAB\nis a challenging problem that is known to be PSPACE-hard in general. We\nconsider in this work the even harder non-Bayesian RMAB, in which the\nparameters of the Markov chain are assumed to be unknown \\emph{a priori}. We\ndevelop an original approach to this problem that is applicable when the\ncorresponding Bayesian problem has the structure that, depending on the known\nparameter values, the optimal solution is one of a prescribed finite set of\npolicies. In such settings, we propose to learn the optimal policy for the\nnon-Bayesian RMAB by employing a suitable meta-policy which treats each policy\nfrom this finite set as an arm in a different non-Bayesian multi-armed bandit\nproblem for which a single-arm selection policy is optimal.

Heralded photon addition or subtraction\nis, as a matter of fact, at the heart of continuous-variable entanglement\ndistillation. The use of such processes has recently been experimentally\ndemonstrated in the context of the generation of optical coherent-state\nsuperpositions or the verification of the canonical commutation relations.\nHere, we carry out a systematic study of the effect of local photon additions\nor subtractions on a two-mode squeezed vacuum state, showing that the\nentanglement generally increases with the number of such operations. This is\nanalytically proven when additions or subtractions are restricted to one mode\nonly, while we observe that the highest entanglement is achieved when these\noperations are equally shared between the two modes. We also note that adding\nphotons typically provides a stronger entanglement enhancement than subtracting\nphotons, while photon subtraction performs better in terms of energy\nefficiency.

First, we show that a low-rank density matrix can be estimated using\nfewer copies of the state, i.e., the sample complexity of tomography decreases\nwith the rank. Second, we show that unknown low-rank states can be\nreconstructed from an incomplete set of measurements, using techniques from\ncompressed sensing and matrix completion. These techniques use simple Pauli\nmeasurements, and their output can be certified without making any assumptions\nabout the unknown state.\n  We give a new theoretical analysis of compressed tomography, based on the\nrestricted isometry property (RIP) for low-rank matrices. Using these tools, we\nobtain near-optimal error bounds, for the realistic situation where the data\ncontains noise due to finite statistics, and the density matrix is full-rank\nwith decaying eigenvalues. We also obtain upper-bounds on the sample complexity\nof compressed tomography, and almost-matching lower bounds on the sample\ncomplexity of any procedure using adaptive sequences of Pauli measurements.\n  Using numerical simulations, we compare the performance of two compressed\nsensing estimators with standard maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE).

We show that the late-time waveform\nof massive scalar perturbations is dominated by a universal oscillatory\ndecaying tail, which appears due to curvature effects. We also show that the\nenergy spectrum is in perfect agreement with a ZFL calculation once no-hair\nproperties of black holes are taken into account. In the second part, we study\nthe phenomenon of superradiance in higher dimensions and conjecture that the\nmaximum energy extracted from a rotating black hole can be understood in terms\nof the ergoregion proper volume. We then study some consequences of\nsuperradiance in the dynamics of moons orbiting around higher-dimensional\nrotating black holes. In four-dimensional spacetime, moons around black holes\ngenerate low-amplitude tides, and the energy extracted from the hole's rotation\nis always smaller than the gravitational radiation lost to infinity. We show\nthat in dimensions larger than five the energy extracted from the black hole\nthrough superradiance is larger than the energy carried out to infinity. Our\nresults lend strong support to the conjecture that tidal acceleration is the\nrule, rather than the exception, in higher dimensions. Superradiance dominates\nthe energy budget and moons \"outspiral\"; for some particular orbital frequency,\nthe energy extracted at the horizon equals the energy emitted to infinity and\n\"floating orbits\" generically occur.

We first discuss the survival probability S(t) that a diffusing\nparticle, in arbitrary spatial dimension, remains inside a conical domain up to\ntime t. In general, this quantity decays algebraically S ~ t^{-beta} in the\nlong-time limit. The exponent beta depends on the opening angle of the cone and\nthe spatial dimension, and it is root of a transcendental equation involving\nthe associated Legendre functions. The exponent becomes a function of a single\nscaling variable in the limit of large spatial dimension. We then describe two\nfirst-passage problems involving the order of N independent Brownian particles\nin one dimension where survival probabilities decay algebraically as well. To\nanalyze these problems, we identify the trajectories of the N particles with\nthe trajectory of one particle in N dimensions, confined to within a certain\nboundary, and we use a circular cone with matching solid angle as a replacement\nfor the confining boundary. For N=3, the confining boundary is a wedge and the\napproach is exact. In general, this \"cone approximation\" gives strict lower\nbounds as well as useful estimates or the first-passage exponents.\nInterestingly, the cone approximation becomes asymptotically exact when\nN-->infinity as it predicts the exact scaling function that governs the\nspectrum of first-passage exponents. \n\n"}

Specifically, we\nshow that general Haldane pseudopotentials (and their sums) can be expressed as\na sum of repulsive non-commuting (p_{x}+ip_{y})-type pairing Hamiltonians. For\nthe Laughlin sequence, it is observed that this problem is frustration free and\nzero energy ground states lie in the common null space of all of these\nnon-commuting Hamiltonians. This property allows for the use of a new truncated\nbasis of pairing configurations in which to express Laughlin states at general\nfilling factors.

Evidence of CDW formation is found for\n0.45<x<0.93, but not for samples with x<0.44 that exhibit incommensurate\nspin-density-wave order, and in slightly overdoped samples with x=0.99. This\nsuggests the presence of two proximate zero-temperature CDW critical points at\ndoping pc1~0.08 and pc2~0.18. The CDW reflections are observed at\nincommensurate in-plane wave vectors (d_a, 0) and (0, d_b). Both decrease\nlinearly with increasing doping, in agreement with recent reports on Bi-based\nhigh-Tc superconductors, but in sharp contrast to the behavior of the 214\nfamily. The CDW intensity and correlation length exhibit maxima at p~0.12,\ncoincident with a plateau in the superconducting transition temperature Tc. The\nonset temperature of the CDW reflections depends non-monotonically on p, with a\nmaximum of~160 K for p~0.12. The RXS reflections exhibit a uniaxial intensity\nanisotropy. We further observe a depression of CDW correlations upon cooling\nbelow Tc, and (for samples with p> 0.09) an enhancement of the signal when an\nexternal magnetic field up to 6 T is applied in the superconducting state.

Inspired by work of Ohtsuki and Nowak and Tarnita et\nal we show that the reaction term is the replicator equation for a modified\ngame matrix and the modifications of the game matrix depend on the interaction\nkernel only through the values of two or three simple probabilities for an\nassociated coalescing random walk.\n  Two strategy games lead to an RDE with a cubic nonlinearity, so we can\ndescribe the phase diagram completely.

At each time\nstep the walk chooses the next step uniformly from among the allowable nearest\nneighbors of the current endpoint of the walk. In the full-plane a nearest\nneighbor is allowable if it has not been visited before and there is a path\nfrom the nearest neighbor to infinity through sites that have not been visited\nbefore. It is well known that on the hexagonal lattice the SKSAW in a bounded\ndomain between two boundary points is equivalent to an interface in critical\npercolation, and hence its scaling limit is the chordal Schramm-Loewner\nevolution with kappa=6 (SLE_6). Like SLE there are variants of the SKSAW\ndepending on the domain and the initial and terminal points. On the hexagonal\nlattice these variants have been shown to converge to the corresponding version\nof SLE_6. We conjecture that the scaling limit of all these variants on any\nregular lattice is the corresponding version of SLE_6.

For spins, however,\nspontaneous emission is generally negligible compared to other non-radiative\nrelaxation processes because of the weak coupling between the magnetic dipole\nand the electromagnetic field. In 1946, Purcell realized that the spontaneous\nemission rate can be strongly enhanced by placing the quantum system in a\nresonant cavity -an effect which has since been used extensively to control the\nlifetime of atoms and semiconducting heterostructures coupled to microwave or\noptical cavities, underpinning single-photon sources. Here we report the first\napplication of these ideas to spins in solids. By coupling donor spins in\nsilicon to a superconducting microwave cavity of high quality factor and small\nmode volume, we reach for the first time the regime where spontaneous emission\nconstitutes the dominant spin relaxation mechanism. The relaxation rate is\nincreased by three orders of magnitude when the spins are tuned to the cavity\nresonance, showing that energy relaxation can be engineered and controlled\non-demand. Our results provide a novel and general way to initialise spin\nsystems into their ground state, with applications in magnetic resonance and\nquantum information processing.

When the true\nvacuum of the theory is located at zero field value, the key property of this\nprescription is the automatic cancellation, to any finite order in perturbation\ntheory, of all tadpole and, more generally, all `cephalopod' Feynman diagrams.\nThe latter are connected diagrams that can be disconnected into two pieces by\ncutting one internal vertex, with either one or both pieces free from external\nlines. In addition, this procedure of `complete normal ordering' (which is an\nextension of the standard field theory definition of normal ordering) reduces\nby a substantial factor the number of Feynman diagrams to be calculated at any\ngiven loop order. We illustrate explicitly the complete normal ordering\nprocedure and the cancellation of cephalopod diagrams in scalar field theories\nwith non-derivative interactions, and by using a point splitting `trick' we\nextend this result to theories with derivative interactions, such as those\nappearing as non-linear sigma-models in the world-sheet formulation of string\ntheory. We focus here on theories with trivial vacua, generalising the\ndiscussion to non-trivial vacua in a follow-up paper. \n\n"}

One of the important objectives of the COMPASS experiment is the\nexploration of transverse spin structure of the nucleon via study of spin\n(in)dependent azimuthal asymmetries with semi-inclusive deep inelastic\nscattering (SIDIS) processes and starting from 2014 also with Drell-Yan (DY)\nreactions. Experimental results obtained by COMPASS for azimuthal effects in\nSIDIS play an important role in the general understanding of the\nthree-dimensional nature of the nucleon. Giving access to the entire \"twist-2\"\nset of transverse momentum dependent (TMD) parton distribution functions (PDFs)\nand fragmentation functions (FFs) COMPASS data trigger constant theoretical\ninterest and are being widely used in phenomenological analyses and global data\nfits. In particular, unique x-$Q^{2}$-z-pT multidimensional results for\ntransverse spin asymmetries recently obtained by COMPASS will serve as a direct\nand unprecedented input for TMD $Q^{2}$-evolution related studies, one of the\nhottest topics in the field of spin-physics.

They\ninclude as a special case Brownian motion with darning, which has been studied\nin details in \\cite{Chen, CF, CFR}.

Mass flow through the accretion\nstreams linking the circumbinary disk to the mini-disks is modulated\nquasi-periodically by the streams' interaction with a nonlinear $m=1$ density\nfeature, or \"lump\", at the inner edge of the circumbinary disk: the stream\nsupplying each mini-disk comes into phase with the lump at a frequency $0.74$\ntimes the binary orbital frequency. Because the binary is relativistic, the\ntidal truncation radii of the mini-disks are not much larger than their\ninnermost stable circular orbits; consequently, the mini-disks' inflow times\nare shorter than the conventional estimate and are comparable to the stream\nmodulation period.

They are expected to be\nvital also in a quantum gravitational system with many underlying fundamental\ndiscrete degrees of freedom. However, due to the absence of well-defined\nconcepts of time and energy in background independent settings, formulating\nstatistical equilibrium in such cases is an open issue. This is even more so in\na quantum gravity context that is not based on any of the usual spacetime\nstructures, but on non-spatiotemporal degrees of freedom. In this paper, after\nhaving clarified general notions of statistical equilibrium, on which two\ndifferent construction procedures for Gibbs states can be based, we focus on\nthe group field theory formalism for quantum gravity, whose technical features\nprove advantageous to the task. We use the operator formulation of group field\ntheory to define its statistical mechanical framework, based on which we\nconstruct three concrete examples of Gibbs states. The first is a Gibbs state\nwith respect to a geometric volume operator, which is shown to support\ncondensation to a low-spin phase. This state is not based on a pre-defined\nsymmetry of the system and its construction is via Jaynes' entropy maximisation\nprinciple. The second are Gibbs states encoding structural equilibrium with\nrespect to internal translations on the GFT base manifold, and defined via the\nKMS condition. The third are Gibbs states encoding relational equilibrium with\nrespect to a clock Hamiltonian, obtained by deparametrization with respect to\ncoupled scalar matter fields. \n\n"}

This complexity often manifests itself as lower\ndimensional manifolds on which the likelihood function is invariant, or varies\nvery little. This can be due to trying to infer unobservable parameters, or due\nto sloppiness in the model which is being used to describe the data. In such a\nsituation, standard sampling methods for characterising the posterior\ndistribution, which do not incorporate information about this structure, will\nbe highly inefficient.\n  In this paper, we seek to develop an approach to tackle this problem when\nusing adaptive importance sampling methods, by using optimal transport maps to\nsimplify posterior distributions which are concentrated on lower dimensional\nmanifolds. This approach is applicable to a whole range of problems for which\nMonte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) methods mix slowly.\n  We demonstrate the approach by considering inverse problems arising from\npartially observed stochastic reaction networks.

It has been proposed that these differences can\npersist up to the critical point, setting up a discontinuous Fermi surface\nchange across a continuous quantum transition.

The\nB-meson decay products are recorded using the Collider Detector at Fermilab\n(CDF) located on the Tevatron collider at Fermilab, USA. Four B-meson decays\nand their charge conjugates are studied: B+ -> J/psi K+, B0 -> J/psi K*(892)0,\nB+ -> psi(2S) K+, and B0 -> psi(2S) K*(892)0. Using a data sample corresponding\nto a time-integrated luminosity of (109 +- 7)/pb, statistically significant\nsignals are observed in all the channels. Topological similarities between the\nB decays are exploited to measure the six relative branching fractions (Br) of\neach channel with respect to the other channels. The ratios involving the B+ ->\nJ/psi K+ mode are Br(B0 -> J/psi K*(892)0) / Br(B+ -> J/psi K+) = 1.76 +-\n0.14[stat] +- 0.15[syst], Br(B+ -> psi(2S) K+) / Br(B+ -> J/psi K+) = 0.558 +-\n0.082[stat] +- 0.056[syst], and Br(B0 -> psi(2S) K*(892)0) / Br(B+ -> J/psi K+)\n= 0.908 +- 0.194[stat] +- 0.100[syst]. The indicated uncertainties are\nstatistical and systematic, respectively. In ratios involving unlike B-meson\nspecies, equal production rates for B+ and B0 mesons have been assumed. The B+\n-> psi(2S) K+ and B0 -> psi(2S) K*(892)0 reconstructions are the first\nobservations of these processes at a hadron collider. The branching-fraction\nratio measurements are consistent with phenomenological predictions that employ\nthe factorization Ansatz, and the derived absolute branching-fraction\nmeasurements are consistent with previous world-average limits and values from\ne+e- colliders.

One current problem of this approach\nis the unavailability of a tractable exact analysis of likelihood based\nstochastic volatility models for the returns of log prices of stocks.\n  With this point in mind, the likelihood models of Barndorff-Nielsen and\nShephard are viewed as members of a much larger class of models. That is\nlikelihoods based on n conditionally independent Normal random variables whose\nmean and variance are representable as linear functionals of a common\nunobserved Poisson random measure. The analysis of these models is facilitated\nby applying the methods in James (2005, 2002), in particular an Esscher type\ntransform of Poisson random measures; in conjunction with a special case of the\nWeber-Sonine formula. It is shown that the marginal likelihood may be expressed\nin terms of a multidimensional Fourier-cosine transform.

Since a circuit exists which can approximate the measurement\nof any observable, in principle one can find a circuit which will estimate any\nsuch polynomial function by averaging over many runs.

Union of all admissible tomograms of both quantum and\nclassical states is discussed in context of interaction of quantum and\nclassical systems. Negative probabilities in classical mechanics and in quantum\nmechanics corresponding to the tomograms of classical states and quantum states\nare compared with properties of nonpositive and nonnegative density operators,\nrespectively. \n\n"}

Such an approach is arguably more\nnatural than viewing the problem as a hidden subgroup problem. We prove that\nthe hidden shift approach to rigid graph isomorphism is hard in two senses.\nFirst, we prove that Omega(n) copies of the hidden shift states are necessary\nto solve the problem (whereas O(n log n) copies are sufficient). Second, we\nprove that if one is restricted to single-register measurements, an exponential\nnumber of hidden shift states are required. \n\n"}
