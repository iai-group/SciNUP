Since it is the localized quasiparticle interference\npeaks rather than the underlying antinodal states themselves which are\ndestroyed at a critical bias, our proposal resolves a conflict between scanning\ntunneling spectroscopy and photoemission regarding the nature of these states. \n\n"}

The discovery of iron-based\nhigh-temperature superconductors has renewed the importance of understanding\nsuperconductivity in materials susceptible to magnetic order and fluctuations.\nIntriguingly they show magnetic fluctuations reminiscent of the superconducting\n(SC) cuprates, including a 'resonance' and an 'hour-glass' shaped dispersion,\nwhich provide an opportunity to new insight to the coupling between spin\nfluctuations and superconductivity. Here we report inelastic neutron scattering\ndata on Fe$_{1+y}$Te$_{0.7}$Se$_{0.3}$ using excess iron concentration to tune\nbetween a SC ($y=0.02$) and a non-SC ($y=0.05$) ground states.

Our results imply that the hourglass shaped dispersion is most\nlikely a pre-requisite for superconductivity, whereas the spin-gap and shift of\nspectral weight are consequences of superconductivity.

In the absence of disorder such\npairing can support both line and point nodes, and both types of nodal\nquasiparticles exhibit nontrivial topology in the momentum space. The point\nnodes, located at the intersections of the closed Fermi surfaces with the\n$c$-axis, act as the double monopoles and the antimonopoles of the Berry\ncurvature, and generalize the notion of Weyl quasiparticles. Consequently, the\n$B$ phase should support an anomalous thermal Hall effect, the polar Kerr\neffect, in addition to the protected Fermi arcs on the (1,0,0) and the (0,1,0)\nsurfaces. The line node at the Fermi surface equator acts as a vortex loop in\nthe momentum space and gives rise to the zero energy, dispersionless Andreev\nbound states on the (0,0,1) surface. At the transition from the $B$-phase to\nthe $A$-phase, the time reversal symmetry is restored, and only the line node\nsurvives inside the $A$-phase. As both line and double-Weyl point nodes possess\nlinearly vanishing density of states, we show that weak disorder acts as a\nmarginally relevant perturbation. Consequently, an infinitesimal amount of\ndisorder destroys the ballistic quasiparticle pole, while giving rise to a\ndiffusive phase with a finite density of states at the zero energy. The\nresulting diffusive phase exhibits $T$-linear specific heat, and an anomalous\nthermal Hall effect.

Loop currents and charge ordering are driven by\ndistinct components of the short-range Coulomb interactions: loop currents\nresult from the repulsion between nearest-neighbor copper and oxygen orbitals,\nwhile charge order results from repulsion between neighboring oxygen orbitals.\nWe find that the leading piLC phase has an antiferromagnetic pattern similar to\npreviously discovered staggered flux phases, and that it emerges abruptly at\nhole dopings p below the van Hove filling. Subsequent charge ordering\ntendencies in the piLC phase reveal that diagonal d-charge density waves (dCDW)\nare suppressed by the loop currents while axial order competes more weakly.

This is in contrast with the common belief that Mott physics and\nphonon-driven s-wave superconductivity are incompatible, raising a fundamental\nquestion on the mechanism of the high-Tc superconductivity. This article\nreviews recent ab initio calculations, which have succeeded in reproducing\ncomprehensively the experimental phase diagram with high accuracy and\nelucidated an unusual cooperation between the electron-phonon coupling and the\nelectron-electron interactions leading to Mott localization to realize an\nunconventional s-wave superconductivity in the alkali-doped fullerides. A\ndriving force behind the exotic physics is unusual intramolecular interactions,\ncharacterized by the coexistence of a strongly repulsive Coulomb interaction\nand a small effectively negative exchange interaction. This is realized by a\nsubtle energy balance between the coupling with the Jahn-Teller phonons and\nHund's coupling within the C60 molecule. The unusual form of the interaction\nleads to a formation of pairs of up- and down-spin electrons on the molecules,\nwhich enables the s-wave pairing. The emergent superconductivity crucially\nrelies on the presence of the Jahn-Teller phonons, but surprisingly benefits\nfrom the strong correlations because the correlations suppress the kinetic\nenergy of the electrons and help the formation of the electron pairs, in\nagreement with previous model calculations. This confirms that the alkali-doped\nfullerides are a new type of unconventional superconductors, where the unusual\nsynergy between the phonons and Coulomb interactions drives the high-Tc\nsuperconductivity. \n\n"}

The wavevector\nof the incommensurate CDW serves as an internal calibration standard of the\ncharge carrier concentration, which allows us to rule out any significant\ninfluence of oxygen non-stoichiometry, and to attribute the observed phenomenon\nto a genuine electronic proximity effect. Long-range proximity effects induced\nby heterointerfaces thus offer a powerful method to stabilize the charge\ndensity wave state in the cuprates, and more generally, to manipulate the\ninterplay between different collective phenomena in metal oxides. \n\n"}

The\nconnection between quantum groups and strings is one way of seeing the validity\nof our previous conjecture [i.e. that a theory for cuprates may be constructed\non the basis of quantum groups]. The cuprates seems to exhibit statistics,\ndimensionality and phase transitions in novel ways. The nature of excitations\n[i.e. quasiparticle or collective] must be understood. The Hubbard model\ncaptures some of the behaviour of the phase transitions in these materials. On\nthe other hand the phases such as stripes in these materials bear relationship\nto quantum group or string-like solutions. One thus expects that the relevant\nsolutions of Hubbard model may thus be written in terms of stringy solutions.\nIn short this approach may lead to the non-perturbative formualtion of Hubbard\nand other condensed matter Hamiltonians. The question arises that how a 1-d\nbased symmetry such as quantum groups can be relevant in describing a 3-d\n[spatial dimensions] system such as cuprates. The answer lies in the key\nobservation that strings which are 1-d objects can be used to describe physics\nin $d$ dimensions. For example gravity [which is a 3-d [spatial] plus time]\nphenomenon can be understood in terms of 1-d strings.

(A) We consider a Josephson qubit\ncoupled resonantly to a two level system, i.e., the qubit and TLS have equal\nenergy splittings. As a result of this resonant interaction, the occupation\nprobability of the excited state of the qubit exhibits beating. Decoherence of\nthe qubit results when the two level system decays from its excited state by\nemitting a phonon. (B) Fluctuations of the two level systems in the oxide\nbarrier produce fluctuations and 1/f noise in the Josephson junction critical\ncurrent I_o. This in turn leads to fluctuations in the qubit energy splitting\nthat degrades the qubit coherence. We compare our results with experiments on\nJosephson junction phase qubits. \n\n"}

The\n63Cu(2) relaxation rate shows little, if any, field dependence in the vicinity\nof the transition temperature Tc(H=0). It is argued how the results in the\nunderdoped compounds can be accounted for by the presence of charge\ninhomogeneities, favoured by chains ordering. \n\n"}

Our\nresults prove also that in dimension two any transition temperature must be\nnon-perturbative in the coupling constant, a result expected on physical\ngrounds.

Two crossovers are found. One is a crossover from the usual BCS state\nto the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of bound fermion pairs. The other is\nfrom the BEC to the relativistic Bose-Einstein condensation (RBEC) of nearly\nmassless bound pairs where antiparticles as well as particles dominate the\nthermodynamics.

Thus the infrared\nbehaviour given by the leading order in 1/N is not modified by higher order\ncorrections.

The factorizing $F$-matrices (or the so-called $F$-basis) play\nan important role in the construction. In the $F$-basis, the creation (and the\nannihilation) operators and the Bethe states of the integrable models are given\nin completely symmetric forms. This leads to the determinant representations of\nthe scalar products of the Bethe states for the models. Based on the scalar\nproducts, the determinant representations of the correlation functions may be\nobtained. As an example, in this review, we give the determinant\nrepresentations of the two-point correlation function for the $\\gl$ (i.e.\nq-deformed) supersymmetric t-J model. The determinant representations are\nuseful for analysing physical properties of the integrable models in the\nthermodynamical limit. \n\n"}

We resolve the paradox\nthat the perturbative expansion is not invariant, as manifested by the\ntemperature dependence of the induced Chern-Simons term, by showing that large\n(unlike small) transformations and hence their Ward identities, are not\nperturbative order-preserving.

The behavior\nof the neutron pair at different densities is simulated by calculating the\ntwo-neutron wave function at several distances between the core nucleus $^9$Li\nand the center of mass of the two neutrons. With this representation, a strong\nconcentration of the neutron pair on the nuclear surface is for the first time\nquantitatively established for neutron-rich nuclei. That is, the neutron pair\nwave function in $^{11}$Li has an oscillatory behavior at normal density, while\nit becomes a well localized single peak in the dilute density region around the\nnuclear surface. We point out that these features qualitatively correspond to\nthe BCS and BEC-like structures of the pair wave function found in infinite\nnuclear matter. \n\n"}
