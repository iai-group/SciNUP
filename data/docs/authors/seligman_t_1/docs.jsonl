Due to the asymmetric topology, the synchronous patterns formed\nin complex networks are irregular and nonstationary. For coupling strength\nimmediately out of the synchronizable region, the typical phenomenon is the\non-off intermittency of the system dynamics. The patterns appeared in this\nprocess are signatured by the coexistence of a giant cluster, which comprises\nmost of the nodes, and a few number of small clusters. The pattern evolution is\ncharacterized by the giant cluster irregularly absorbs or emits the small\nclusters. As the coupling strength leaves away from the synchronization\nbifurcation point, the giant cluster is gradually dissolved into a number of\nsmall clusters, and the system dynamics is characterized by the integration and\nseparation of the small clusters. Dynamical mechanisms and statistical\nproperties of the nonstationary pattern evolution are analyzed and conducted,\nand some scalings are newly revealed. Remarkably, it is found that the few\nactive nodes, which escape from the giant cluster with a high frequency, are\nindependent of the coupling strength while are sensitive to the bifurcation\ntypes. We hope our findings about nonstationary pattern could give additional\nunderstandings to the dynamics of complex systems and have implications to some\nreal problems where systems maintain their normal functions only in the\nunsynchronizable state. \n\n"}

This paper features four\ncontributions. First, we characterize and distinguish the different notions of\nsynchronization used throughout the literature and formally introduce the\nconcept of phase cohesiveness as an analysis tool and performance index for\nsynchronization. Second, we review the vast literature providing necessary,\nsufficient, implicit, and explicit estimates of the critical coupling strength\nfor finite and infinite-dimensional, and for first and second-order Kuramoto\nmodels. Third, we present the first explicit necessary and sufficient condition\non the critical coupling to achieve synchronization in the finite-dimensional\nKuramoto model for an arbitrary distribution of the natural frequencies. The\nmultiplicative gap in the synchronization condition yields a practical\nstability result determining the admissible initial and the guaranteed ultimate\nphase cohesiveness as well as the guaranteed asymptotic magnitude of the order\nparameter. Fourth and finally, we extend our analysis to multi-rate Kuramoto\nmodels consisting of second-order Kuramoto oscillators with inertia and viscous\ndamping together with first-order Kuramoto oscillators with multiple time\nconstants. We prove that the multi-rate Kuramoto model is locally topologically\nconjugate to a first-order Kuramoto model with scaled natural frequencies, and\nwe present necessary and sufficient conditions for almost global phase\nsynchronization and local frequency synchronization. Interestingly, these\nconditions do not depend on the inertiae which contradicts prior observations\non the role of inertiae in synchronization of second-order Kuramoto models. \n\n"}

Often the\nSchr\\\"odinger equation is dependent on some parameter and one is interested in\nfollowing the path of the resonances in the complex energy plane as the\nparameter changes. This is particularly true in coupled channel systems where\nthe resonant behavior is highly dependent on the strength of the channel\ncoupling, the energy separation of the channels and other factors. In previous\nwork it was shown that numerical continuation, a technique familiar in the\nstudy of dynamical systems, can be brought to bear on the problem of following\nthe resonance path in one dimensional problems and multi-channel problems\nwithout energy separation between the channels. A regularization can be defined\nthat eliminates coalescing poles and zeros that appear in the S-matrix at the\norigin due to symmetries.

Such processes suffer from the quantum Zeno effect -- the continual\nmonitoring of a quantum system in a Hilbert subspace prevents its state from\nleaving that subspace. As a consequence, path integral amplitudes defined in\nthis seemingly obvious way have physically and intuitively unreasonable\nproperties and in particular, no sensible classical limit. In this paper we\ndescribe this frequently-occurring but little-appreciated phenomenon in some\ndetail, showing clearly the connection with the quantum Zeno effect.

It is first examined if\nthe quantum discord is classically described by the hidden-variable model of\nBell in the Hilbert space with $d=2$. The criterion of vanishing quantum\ndiscord is related to the notion of reduction and, surprisingly, the\nhidden-variable model in $d=2$, which has been believed to be consistent so\nfar, is in fact inconsistent and excluded by the analysis of conditional\nmeasurement and reduction. The description of the full contents of quantum\ndiscord by the deterministic hidden-variables models is not possible. We also\nre-examine CHSH inequality. It is shown that the well-known prediction of CHSH\ninequality $|B|\\leq 2$ for the CHSH operator $B$ introduced by Cirel'son is not\nunique. This non-uniqueness arises from the failure of linearity condition in\nthe non-contextual hidden-variables model in $d=4$ used by Bell and CHSH, in\nagreement with Gleason's theorem which excludes $d=4$ non-contextual\nhidden-variables models. If one imposes the linearity condition, their model is\nconverted to a factored product of two $d=2$ models which describes quantum\nmechanical separable states. The CHSH inequality thus does not test the\nhidden-variables model in $d=4$. This observation is consistent with an\napplication of the CHSH inequality to quantum cryptography by Ekert, which is\nbased on mixed separable states without referring to dispersion-free\nrepresentations.

Several striking features come up.\nTopological charge emerges as a collective flow of quantum numbers carried by\nindividual corpuscles. Moreover, the corpuscular corrections are not reducible\nto any known form of quantum corrections, such as loop expansions in the\ncoupling constant $\\hbar g^2$ or semiclassical $e^{-1/\\hbar g^2}$ effects.\nCorpuscular corrections are stronger and appear already at order $\\sqrt{\\hbar\ng^2}$.

We show that a domain wall which perturbatively is a BPS state,\nviolates all supersymmetries when the corpuscular effects are taken into\naccount.

Abstract: We study the effect of adding to a directed chain of interconnected systems a\ndirected feedback from the last element in the chain to the first. The problem\nis closely related to the fundamental question of how a change in network\ntopology may influence the behavior of coupled systems. We begin the analysis\nby investigating a simple linear system. The matrix that specifies the system\ndynamics is the transpose of the network Laplacian matrix, which codes the\nconnectivity of the network. Our analysis shows that for any nonzero complex\neigenvalue $\\lambda$ of this matrix, the following inequality holds:\n$\\frac{|\\Im \\lambda |}{|\\Re \\lambda |} \\leq \\cot\\frac{\\pi}{n}$. This bound is\nsharp, as it becomes an equality for an eigenvalue of a simple directed cycle\nwith uniform interaction weights. The latter has the slowest decay of\noscillations among all other network configurations with the same number of\nstates. The result is generalized to directed rings and chains of identical\nnonlinear oscillators. For directed rings, a lower bound $\\sigma_c$ for the\nconnection strengths that guarantees asymptotic synchronization is found to\nfollow a similar pattern: $\\sigma_c=\\frac{1}{1-\\cos\\left( 2\\pi /n\\right)} $.\nNumerical analysis revealed that, depending on the network size $n$, multiple\ndynamic regimes co-exist in the state space of the system. In addition to the\nfully synchronous state a rotating wave solution occurs. The effect is observed\nin networks exceeding a certain critical size. The emergence of a rotating wave\nhighlights the importance of long chains and loops in networks of oscillators:\nthe larger the size of chains and loops, the more sensitive the network\ndynamics becomes to removal or addition of a single connection. \n\n"}

However, this strong rigidity result comes at a\nhigh price, requiring a large number of entangled pairs to be tested. In this\npaper, we present a significant improvement in terms of the overhead by instead\nconsidering quantum steering where the device of the one side is trusted.

However, it has been\nnoticed that for fidelity based metrics such as the Bures distance, the risk of\nconventional (non-adaptive) qubit tomography schemes scales as $1/\\sqrt{n}$ for\nstates close to the boundary of the Bloch sphere. Several proposed estimators\nappear to improve this scaling, and our goal is to analyse the problem from the\nperspective of the maximum risk over all states.\n  We propose qubit estimation strategies based on separate and adaptive\nmeasurements, that achieve $1/n$ scalings for the maximum Bures risk.

However, the asymptotic nature\nof this conclusion prevents us from calculating exactly how many qubits these\nquantum circuits must have for their classical simulation to be intractable on\nmodern classical supercomputers. We refine these quantum computational\nsupremacy arguments and perform such a calculation by imposing fine-grained\nversions of the non-collapse assumption. Each version is parameterized by a\nconstant $a$ and asserts that certain specific computational problems with\ninput size $n$ require $2^{an}$ time steps to be solved by a non-deterministic\nalgorithm. Then, we choose a specific value of $a$ for each version that we\nargue makes the assumption plausible, and based on these conjectures we\nconclude that Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial-Time (IQP) circuits with 208\nqubits, Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) circuits with 420\nqubits and boson sampling circuits (i.e. linear optical networks) with 98\nphotons are large enough for the task of producing samples from their output\ndistributions up to constant multiplicative error to be intractable on current\ntechnology. In the first two cases, we extend this to constant additive error\nby introducing an average-case fine-grained conjecture. \n\n"}

Several proposals for entangling gates in\nsuperconducting qubits tune the flux bias away from these spots, thus\nreintroducing the dephasing problem to varying degrees.

This is defined as the minimal constant $\\rho$\nsuch that $\\|\\cdot\\|_{X\\otimes_\\pi Y}\\leq\\rho\\,\\|\\cdot\\|_{X\\otimes_\\varepsilon\nY}$ holds for all Banach spaces of dimensions $\\dim X=n$ and $\\dim Y=m$, where\n$X\\otimes_\\pi Y$ and $X \\otimes_\\varepsilon Y$ are the projective and injective\ntensor products. By requiring that $X=Y$, one obtains a symmetrised version of\nthe above ratio, denoted by $r_s(n)$. We prove that $r(n,m)\\geq 19/18$ for all\n$n,m\\geq 2$, implying that injective and projective tensor products are never\nisometric. We then study the asymptotic behaviour of $r(n,m)$ and $r_s(n)$,\nshowing that, up to log factors: $r_s(n)$ is of the order $\\sqrt{n}$ (which is\nsharp); $r(n,n)$ is at least of the order $n^{1/6}$; and $r(n,m)$ grows at\nleast as $\\min\\{n,m\\}^{1/8}$. These results constitute our main contribution to\nthe theory of tensor norms. In our proof, a crucial role is played by an\n'$\\ell_1$/$\\ell_2$/$\\ell_{\\infty}$ trichotomy theorem' based on ideas by\nPisier, Rudelson, Szarek, and Tomczak-Jaegermann. The main operational\nconsequence we draw is that there is a universal gap between local and global\nstrategies in general XOR games, and that this grows as a power of the minimal\nlocal dimension. In the quantum case, we are able to determine this gap up to\nuniversal constants. As a corollary, we obtain an improved bound on the scaling\nof the maximal quantum data hiding efficiency against local measurements. \n\n"}

Here, we investigate the connection between the spectral properties of\nthe quantum-mechanical scattering matrix and its semiclassical equivalent based\non the semiclassical zeta-function of Gutzwiller and Voros. Our\nquantum-mechanical calculation is well-defined at every step, as the on-shell\nT-matrix and the multiscattering kernel M-1 are shown to be trace-class. The\nmultiscattering determinant can be organized in terms of the cumulant expansion\nwhich is the defining prescription for the determinant over an infinite, but\ntrace-class matrix. The quantum cumulants are then expanded by traces which, in\nturn, split into quantum itineraries or cycles. These can be organized by a\nsimple symbolic dynamics. The semiclassical reduction of the coherent\nmultiscattering part takes place on the level of the quantum cycles. We show\nthat the semiclassical analog of the m-th quantum cumulant is the m-th\ncurvature term of the semiclassical zeta function.

The perturbation series exhibits a\nrich singularity structure in the Borel plane. Resummation methods are\npresented which appear to lead to consistent results even in problematic cases\nwhere isolated singularities or branch cuts are present on the positive and\nnegative real axis in the Borel plane. Two resummation prescriptions are\ncompared: (i) a variant of the Borel-Pade resummation method, with an\nadditional improvement due to utilization of the leading renormalon poles (for\na comprehensive discussion of renormalons see [M.

We explain why it is not logically possible\nto ``pull back'' an argument valid only at n=infinity into a limit statement,\nlet alone one valid for a finite number of transmissions n.

We give an example of an unconditionally\nsecure cheat sensitive non-relativistic bit commitment protocol which uses\nquantum information to implement a task which is classically impossible; we\nalso describe a simple relativistic protocol. \n\n"}

We pay particular\nattention to the fact that atomic fields actually consist of composite\nparticles that can easily be separated into their basic constituents by a\ndetection process such as photoionization. In the case of bosonic fields, that\nwe specifically consider here, this leads to the appearance in the detection\nsignal of exchange contributions due to both the composite bosonic field and\nits individual fermionic constituents. We also show how time-gated counting\nschemes allow to isolate specific contributions to the signal, in particular\ninvolving different orderings of the Schr\\\"odinger and Maxwell fields. \n\n"}

{"id": "quant-ph/9912084", "contents": "Title: The Uncertainty Way of Generalization of Coherent States Abstract: The three ways of generalization of canonical coherent states are briefly\nreviewed and compared with the emphasis laid on the (minimum) uncertainty way.\nThe characteristic uncertainty relations, which include the Schroedinger and\nRobertson inequalities, are extended to the case of several states. It is shown\nthat the standard SU(1,1) and SU(2) coherent states are the unique states which\nminimize the second order characteristic inequality for the three generators. A\nset of states which minimize the Schroedinger inequality for the Hermitian\ncomponents of the su_q(1,1) ladder operator is also constructed. It is noted\nthat the characteristic uncertainty relations can be written in the alternative\ncomplementary form. \n\n"}
