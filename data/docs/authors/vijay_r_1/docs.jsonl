Two such systems have been proposed: (a) s-wave\nsuperconductor pair potential is proximity induced on a semiconductor, and (b)\npair potential naturally arises from an intrinsic s-wave pairing interaction.\nAs is now well known, such systems in the form of a 2D film or 1D nano-wires in\na wire-network can be used for topological quantum computation. When the\nexternal Zeeman splitting $\\Gamma$ crosses a critical value $\\Gamma_c$, the\nsystem passes from a regular superconducting phase to a non-Abelian topological\nsuperconducting phase. In both cases (a) and (b) we consider in this paper the\npair potential $\\Delta$ is strictly s-wave in both the ordinary and the\ntopological superconducting phases, which are separated by a topological\nquantum critical point at $\\Gamma_c = \\sqrt{\\Delta^2 + \\mu^2}$, where $\\mu (>>\n\\Delta)$ is the chemical potential.

In this paper we address the question of how a\npure s-wave pair potential can survive a strong Zeeman field to give rise to a\ntopological superconducting phase.

Using\nquasiclassical Green's function method, we show that the magnetization becomes\nfinite inside N. The origin of this magnetization is due to odd-frequency\nspin-triplet Cooper pairs formed by electrons of equal and opposite spins,\nwhich are induced by proximity effect in the S/F1/N/F2/S junction. We find that\nthe magnetization M(d,q) in N can be decomposed into two parts,\nM(d,q)=MI(d)+MII(d,q), where q is the superconducting phase difference between\ntwo Ss and d is the thickness of N. MI(d) exists generally in S/F junctions,\nwhile MII(d,q) carries all q dependence and represents the fingerprint of phase\ncoherence between two Ss in Josephson junctions. The q dependence thus allows\nus to control the magnetization in N by tuning q for a fixed d. We show that\nMI(d) weakly decreases with increasing d, while the q dependent magnetization\nMII(d,q) rapidly decays with d. Moreover, we find that the time-averaged\nmagnetization <MII(d,q)> exhibits discontinuous peak at each resonance DC\nvoltage Vn=nhw_S/2e(n: integer) when DC voltage V as well as AC voltage v_ac(t)\nwith frequency w_S are both applied to the S/F1/N/F2/S junction.

We also discuss that\nthe magnetization induced in N can be measurably large in realistic systems.\nTherefore, the measurement of the induced magnetization serves as an\nalternative way to detect the phase coherence between two Ss in Josephson\njunctions.

Two-photon processes are identified at\nhigher coupling, and pair absorption dominates over pair emission for all bias\nvoltages. As a result, the number of cavity photons, the cavity damping rate\nand the second order coherence $g^{(2)}$ are all reduced and exhibit less\nbunching than the thermal state. These results are obtained with a Keldysh path\nintegral formulation and reproduced with rate equations. They can be seen as a\nbackaction of the cavity measuring the electronic noise. Extending the standard\n$P(E)$ theory to a steady-state situation, we compute the modified noise\nproperties of the conductor and find quantitative agreement with the\nperturbative calculation. \n\n"}

Superconducting circuits made from\naluminium or niobium are fundamentally limited by losses due to two-level\ndefects within the amorphous oxide layers encasing them. On the other hand,\nthese circuits also provide a novel and effective method for studying the very\ndefects which limit their operation. We can now go beyond ensemble measurements\nand probe individual defects -- observing the quantum nature of their dynamics\nand studying their formation, their behaviour as a function of applied field,\nstrain, temperature and other properties. This article reviews the plethora of\nrecent experimental results in this area and discusses the various theoretical\nmodels which have been used to describe the observations. In doing so, it\nsummarises the current approaches to solving this fundamentally important\nproblem in solid-state physics. \n\n"}

As a promising\ncandidate in this race, the one-dimensional chiral Majorana edge mode (CMEM) in\ntopological insulator-superconductor heterostructures has gathered renewed\ninterests during recent months after an experimental breakthrough.

In particular, in a photoinduced topological superconductor sandwiched\nbetween two Floquet Chern insulators, it is found that for each Floquet\nsideband, the CMEM admits equal probability for normal transmission and local\nAndreev reflection over a wide range of parameter regimes, yielding\nhalf-integer quantized plateaus that resist static and time-periodic disorder.\nThe $\\frac{3}{2}\\frac{e^2}{h}$ plateau has not yet been computationally or\nexperimentally observed in any other superconducting system, and indicates the\npossibility to simultaneously create and manipulate multiple pairs of CMEMs by\nlight. The robust half-quantized conductance plateaus, due to CMEMs at\nquasienergies zero or half the driving frequency, are both fascinating and\nsubtle because they only emerge after a summation over contributions from all\nFloquet sidebands.

We demonstrate that finiteness of the superconductor in one of\ndimensions provides the energy gap for all directions of quasiparticle motion\nexcept for \\theta=45 degrees (\\theta is the angle between the trajectory and\nthe surface normal); then the angle-averaged DoS behaves linearly at small\nenergies. This result is valid unless the crystal is 0- or 45-oriented (\\alpha\n\\ne 0 or 45 degrees, where \\alpha is the angle between the a-axis and the\nsurface normal). In the special case of \\alpha=0, the spectrum is gapped for\nall trajectories \\theta; the angle-averaged DoS is also gapped.

In all the cases, the\nangle-resolved DoS consists of energy bands that are formed similarly to the\nKronig-Penney model.

We concentrate on the cavity susceptibility as it can be directly\nexperimentally addressed, i.e., as the impedance or the reflection coefficient\nof the cavity. To this end we investigate the dissipative Jaynes-Cummings model\nin the strong coupling regime at high temperatures. The dynamics is\ninvestigated within the Bloch-Redfield formalism. At low temperatures, when\nonly the few lowest levels are occupied the susceptibility can be presented as\na sum of contributions from independent level-to-level transitions.

We construct the zero temperature phase diagram both of the\nBose-Hubbard model (BHM), and of a spin-S Heisenberg model (SHM) with the XXZ\nanisotropy. The phase diagram of the BHM indicates a phase transition from a\nMott insulator to a compressibile superfluid phase, and shows the expected\nlobe-like structure. The SHM phase diagram displays a quantum phase transition\nbetween a paramagnetic and a canted phases showing as well a lobe-like\nstructure. We show how the BHM and Quantum Phase model (QPM) can be rigorously\nderived from the SHM. Based on such results, the phase boundaries of the SHM\nare mapped to the BHM ones, while the phase diagram of the QPM is related to\nthat of the SHM. The QPM's phase diagram obtained through the application of\nour approach to the SHM, describes the known onset of the macroscopic phase\ncoherence from the Coulomb blockade regime for increasing Josephson coupling\nconstant. The BHM and the QPM phase diagrams are in good agreement with Quantum\nMonte Carlo results, and with the third order strong coupling perturbative\nexpansion. \n\n"}
{"id": "cond-mat/9910473", "contents": "Title: Nucleation of Superconductivity in a Mesoscopic Loop of Finite Width Abstract: The normal/superconducting phase boundary Tc has been calculated for\nmesoscopic loops, as a function of an applied perpendicular magnetic field H.\nWhile for thin-wire loops and filled disks the Tc(H) curves are well known, the\nintermediate case, namely mesoscopic loops of finite wire width, have been\nstudied much less. The linearized first Ginzburg-Landau equation is solved with\nthe proper normal/vacuum boundary conditions both at the internal and at the\nexternal loop radius. For thin-wire loops the Tc(H) oscillations are perfectly\nperiodic, and the Tc(H) background is parabolic (this is the usual Little-Parks\neffect). For loops of thicker wire width, there is a crossover magnetic field\nabove which Tc(H) becomes quasi-linear, with the period identical to the Tc(H)\nof a filled disk (i.e. pseudoperiodic oscillations). This dimensional\ntransition is similar to the 2D-3D transition for thin films in a parallel\nfield, where vortices start penetrating the material as soon as the film\nthickness exceeds the temperature dependent coherence length by a factor 1.8.\nFor the presently studied loops, the crossover point is controlled by a similar\ncondition. In the high field '3D' regime, a giant vortex state establishes,\nwhere only a surface superconducting sheath near the sample's outer radius is\npresent. \n\n"}
