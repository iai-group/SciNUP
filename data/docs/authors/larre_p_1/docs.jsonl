Our study is motivated by the\nfact that multiple matter-wave dark solitons may naturally form in such\nsettings as per our recent work [Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 130401 (2008)]. First,\nwe study the dark soliton interactions and show that the dynamics of\nwell-separated solitons (i.e., ones that undergo a collision with relatively\nlow velocities) can be analyzed by means of particle-like equations of motion.\nThe latter take into regard the repulsion between solitons (via an effective\nrepulsive potential) and the confinement and dimensionality of the system (via\nan effective parabolic trap for each soliton). Next, based on the fact that\nstationary, well-separated dark multi-soliton states emerge as a nonlinear\ncontinuation of the appropriate excited eigensates of the quantum harmonic\noscillator, we use a Bogoliubov-de Gennes analysis to systematically study the\nstability of such structures.

In this paper we give\ndensity-functional definitions of spin-conserving gaps, spin-flip gaps and the\nspin stiffness in terms of many-body energies and in terms of single-particle\n(Kohn-Sham) energies. Our definitions are as analogous as possible to those\ncommonly made in the charge case, but important differences between spin and\ncharge gaps emerge already on the single-particle level because unlike the\nfundamental charge gap spin gaps involve excited-state energies. Kohn-Sham and\nmany-body spin gaps are predicted to differ, and the difference is related to\nderivative discontinuities that are similar to, but distinct from, those\nusually considered in the case of charge gaps.

These\ninsulators are not required to have gapless boundary modes in the energy\nspectrum.

Their entanglement entropy\ncannot be made to vanish adiabatically, and hence the insulators can be called\ntopological. There is a direct connection between the inversion eigenvalues of\nthe band structure and the mid-gap states in the entanglement spectrum. The\nclassification of protected entanglement levels is given by an integer $n\\in\nZ$, which is the difference between the negative inversion eigenvalues at\ninversion symmetric points in the Brillouin zone, taken in sets of two. When\nthe Hamiltonian describes a Chern insulator or a non-trivial T-invariant\ntopological insulator, the entanglement spectrum exhibits spectral flow. If the\nChern number is zero for the former, or T is broken in the latter, the\nentanglement spectrum does \\emph{not} have spectral flow, but, depending on the\ninversion eigenvalues, can still have protected midgap bands.

We numerically compare\nthe ground state energies of the mean-field Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) and\nvarious trial wave-functions, where bosons avoid each other at short distances.\nWe discover that, at low densities, several types of strongly correlated states\nhave an energy per particle ($\\epsilon$), which scales with density ($n$) as\n$\\epsilon \\sim n^{4/3}$, in contrast to $\\epsilon \\sim n$ for the weakly\ninteracting Bose gas.

Using\nquasiclassical Green's function method, we show that the magnetization becomes\nfinite inside N. The origin of this magnetization is due to odd-frequency\nspin-triplet Cooper pairs formed by electrons of equal and opposite spins,\nwhich are induced by proximity effect in the S/F1/N/F2/S junction. We find that\nthe magnetization M(d,q) in N can be decomposed into two parts,\nM(d,q)=MI(d)+MII(d,q), where q is the superconducting phase difference between\ntwo Ss and d is the thickness of N. MI(d) exists generally in S/F junctions,\nwhile MII(d,q) carries all q dependence and represents the fingerprint of phase\ncoherence between two Ss in Josephson junctions. The q dependence thus allows\nus to control the magnetization in N by tuning q for a fixed d. We show that\nMI(d) weakly decreases with increasing d, while the q dependent magnetization\nMII(d,q) rapidly decays with d. Moreover, we find that the time-averaged\nmagnetization <MII(d,q)> exhibits discontinuous peak at each resonance DC\nvoltage Vn=nhw_S/2e(n: integer) when DC voltage V as well as AC voltage v_ac(t)\nwith frequency w_S are both applied to the S/F1/N/F2/S junction.

The model corresponds to the class of\ninteracting Luttinger Liquids, which extends the quadratic Luttinger theory by\na weak integrability breaking phonon scattering term. In order to solve for the\nnon-equilibrium time evolution, we use kinetic equations for the phonon\ndensities, exploiting the resonant but subleading character of the phonon\ninteraction term. The interplay between phonon scattering and the quadratic\nLuttinger theory leads to the emergence of three distinct spatio-temporal\nregimes for the fermionic real-space correlation function. It features the\ncrossover from a prequench to a prethermal state, finally evolving towards a\nthermal state on increasing length and time scales.

Physical realizations of multidimensional solitons in atomic\nBose-Einstein condensates (BECs) and nonlinear optics are briefly discussed\ntoo. Unlike 1D solitons, which are typically stable, 2D and 3D ones are\nvulnerable to instabilities induced by the occurrence of the critical and\nsupercritical collapse, respectively, in the same 2D and 3D models that give\nrise to the solitons. Vortex solitons are subject to a still stronger splitting\ninstability. For this reason, a central problem is search for physical settings\nin which 2D and 3D solitons may be stabilized. The brief review addresses one\nwell-established topic, viz., the stabilization of the 3D and 2D states, with S\n= 0 and 1, trapped in harmonic-oscillator (HO) potentials, and another topic\nwhich was developed very recently: the stabilization of 2D and 3D free-space\nsolitons, which juxtapose components with S = 0 and (+/-)1 (semi-vortices and\nmixed modes), in a binary system with the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) between its\ncomponents.

Few-body physics is a cross-cutting discipline not restricted to\nconventional subject ar- eas such as nuclear physics or atomic or molecular\nphysics. To a large degree, the recent explosion of interest in this subject\nhas been sparked by dramatic enhancements of experimental capabilities in\nultracold atomic systems over the past decade, which now permit atoms and\nmolecules to be explored deep in the quantum mechanical limit with controllable\ntwo-body interactions. This control, typically enabled by magnetic or\nelectromagnetically-dressed Fano-Feshbach resonances, allows in particular\naccess to the range of universal few-body physics, where two-body scattering\nlengths far exceed all other length scales in the problem. The Efimov effect,\nwhere 3 particles experienc- ing short-range interactions can\ncounterintuitively exhibit an infinite number of bound or quasi-bound energy\nlevels, is the most famous example of universality. Tremendous progress in the\nfield of universal Efimov physics has taken off, driven particularly by a\ncombination of experimental and theoretical studies in the past decade, and\nprior to the first observation in 2006, by an extensive set of theoretical\nstudies dating back to 1970.

In a time reversal symmetric (TRS) Weyl semimetal film,\nthe confinement gap gives the quasiparticles a mass, while TRS is preserved by\nhaving an even number of valleys with opposite masses.

To demonstrate the capabilities of our approach, we calculate the\nresponse of the system to an external magnetic field, the dependence of the\neffective chemical potential on the work function difference, and the\ndependence of the effective semiconductor-superconductor coupling on the\napplied gate potential.

As an alternative path to\nperforming universal quantum computation, within the NISQ era limitations, we\npropose to merge digital single-qubit operations with analog multi-qubit\nentangling blocks in an approach we call digital-analog quantum computing\n(DAQC). Along these lines, although the techniques may be extended to any\nresource, we propose to use unitaries generated by the ubiquitous Ising\nHamiltonian for the analog entangling block and we prove its universal\ncharacter.

The long-range order of such an electron crystal (or\nequivalently, a $4 k_F$ charge-density wave) is destroyed by impurities. The 3D\narray of chains behaves differently at large and at small impurity\nconcentrations $N$. At large $N$, impurities divide the chains into metallic\nrods. The low-temperature conductivity is due to the variable-range hopping of\nelectrons between the rods. It obeys the Efros-Shklovskii (ES) law and\nincreases exponentially as $N$ decreases. When $N$ is small, the metallic-rod\npicture of the ground state survives only in the form of rare clusters of\natypically short rods. They are the source of low-energy charge excitations.

The Fano factor P/I (the ratio of the\nnoise power and the mean transmitted current) is related to the scattering\nmatrix of the medium. This is the optical analogue of Buttiker's formula for\nelectronic shot noise. Scattering by itself has no effect on the Fano factor,\nwhich remains equal to 1 (as for a Poisson process). Absorption and\namplification both increase the Fano factor above the Poisson value. For strong\nabsorption P/I has the universal limit 1+3f/2 with f the Bose-Einstein function\nat the frequency of the incident radiation. This is the optical analogue of the\none-third reduction factor of electronic shot noise in diffusive conductors.
