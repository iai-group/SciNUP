But -- do we know how clouds form\non brown dwarfs and extra-solar planets? How do they look like? Can we see\nthem? What are they composed of? Cloud formation is an old-fashioned but still\noutstanding problem for the Earth atmosphere, and it has turned into a\nchallenge for the modelling of brown dwarf and exo-planetary atmospheres. Cloud\nformation imposes strong feedbacks on the atmospheric structure, not only due\nto the clouds own opacity, but also due to the depletion of the gas phase,\npossibly leaving behind a dynamic and still supersaturated atmosphere. I\nsummarise the different approaches taken to model cloud formation in substellar\natmospheres and workout their differences. Focusing on the\nphase-non-equilibrium approach to cloud formation, I demonstrate the inside we\ngain from detailed micro-physical modelling on for instance the material\ncomposition and grain size distribution inside the cloud layer on a Brown Dwarf\natmosphere. A comparison study on four different cloud approaches in Brown\nDwarf atmosphere simulations demonstrates possible uncertainties in\ninterpretation of observational data. \n\n"}

We also\nshow that any Bondi-Hoyle accretion of contaminated residual gas from the natal\nstar cluster made a negligible contribution to the primordial Al-26 inventory\nof the Solar System. These results are consistent with the absence of the\noxygen isotopic signature expected with any late introduction of supernova\nejecta into the protoplanetary disk. Instead, the presence of Al-26 in the\noldest Solar System solids (calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions or CAIs) and its\napparent uniform distribution with the inferred canonical Al-26/Al-27 ratio of\n(4.5-5)E-5 support the inheritance of Al-26 from the parent giant molecular\ncloud.

We calculated the Galactic\ndistribution of Al-26/Al-27 ratios that arise from such contamination using the\nestablished embedded cluster mass and stellar initial mass functions, published\nnucleosynthetic yields from the winds of massive stars, and by assuming rapid\nand uniform mixing into the cloud. Although our model predicts that the\nmajority of stellar systems contain no Al-26 from massive stars, and that the a\npriori probability that the Al-26/Al-27 ratio will reach or exceed the\ncanonical Solar System value is only ~6%, the maximum in the distribution of\nnon-zero values is close to the canonical ratio. \n\n"}

In one of the plausible models for explaining the\nphenomenon, the modulation is caused by the effects of a magnetic field. So\nfar, the available observational data have not allowed us to either support nor\nrule out the presence of a magnetic field in RR Lyrae stars.

Traditional N-body simulations of multiple-planet systems without\ngas disks have successfully reproduced the eccentricity (e) distribution of the\nobserved systems, by assuming that the planetary systems are relatively closely\npacked when the gas disk dissipates, so that they become dynamically unstable\nwithin the stellar lifetime. However, such studies cannot explain the small\nsemi-major axes (a) of extrasolar planetary systems, if planets are formed, as\nthe standard planet formation theory suggests, beyond the ice line.\n  In this paper, we numerically study the evolution of three-planet systems in\ndissipating gas disks, and constrain the initial conditions that reproduce the\nobserved semi-major axis and eccentricity distributions simultaneously. We\nadopt the initial conditions that are motivated by the standard planet\nformation theory, and self-consistently simulate the disk evolution, and planet\nmigration by using a hybrid N-body and 1D gas disk code. We also take account\nof eccentricity damping, and investigate the effect of saturation of corotation\nresonances on the evolution of planetary systems. We find that the semi-major\naxis distribution is largely determined in a gas disk, while the eccentricity\ndistribution is determined after the disk dissipation. We also find that there\nmay be an optimum disk mass which leads to the observed a-e distribution. Our\nsimulations generate a larger fraction of planetary systems trapped in\nmean-motion resonances (MMRs) than the observations, indicating that the disk's\nperturbation to the planetary orbits may be important to explain the observed\nrate of MMRs.

For EHB-GCs, we find a\ncorrelation between the present-day v_esc and their metallicity as well as\n(V-I)_0 colour. The similar v_esc, (V-I)_0 distribution of nGCs and EHB-GCs\nimplies that nGCs could also have complex stellar populations. The v_esc-[Fe/H]\nrelation could reflect the known relation of increasing stellar wind velocity\nwith metallicity, which in turn could explain why more metal-poor clusters\ntypically show more peculiarities in their stellar population than more\nmetal-rich clusters of the same mass do.

We detect infrared excesses\ndue to free-free emission among ~900 OB stars, which correlate with luminosity\nclass. We confirm the presence of dust around 10 supergiant B[e] stars, finding\nthe shape of their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to be very similar, in\ncontrast to the variety of SED shapes among the spectrally variable LBVs.

By means of multi-epoch\nand multi-wavelength narrow-band images, we derived proper motions, tangential\nvelocities, velocity and flux variability of the knots.

Finally, spatial\nvelocities and inclination of the flows were obtained by combining both imaging\nand spectroscopy. The P.M. analysis reveals three distinct, partially\noverlapping outflows. In 20 years, about 60% of the knots show some degree of\nflux variability. Our set of observations apparently indicates acceleration and\ndeceleration in a variety of knots along the jets. For about 20% of the knots,\nmostly coincident with working surfaces or interacting knots along the flows, a\nrelevant variability in both flux and velocity is observed.

We find\nthat it is unlikely for the Arches to have attained the observed degree of mass\nsegregation at its current age starting from a standard non-segregated Kroupa\nIMF. We also study the possibility of a collisional runaway developing in the\nfirst $\\sim 2-3 \\rm{Myr}$ of dynamical evolution. We find that the evolution of\nthis cluster is dramatically different depending on the choice of IMF: if a\nprimordially mass segregated IMF is chosen, a collisional runaway should always\noccur between $2-3 \\rm{Myr}$ for a broad range of initial concentrations. In\ncontrast, for a standard Kroupa IMF no collisional runaway is predicted.

We\ndetect 11 binaries out of 37 Be targets (corresponding to a binary fraction of\n30 +/- 8%) and 10 binaries out of 36 B targets (29 +/- 8%). Further tests\ndemonstrate that the B and Be binary systems are not only similar in frequency\nbut also remarkably similar in terms of binary separations, flux differences\nand mass ratios. We find that any hypotheses invoking binary companions as\nresponsible for the formation of a disk need the companions to be closer than\n20 AU. Close companions are known to affect the circumstellar disks of Be\nstars, but as not all Be stars have been found to be close binaries, the data\nsuggest that binarity can not be responsible for the Be phenomenon in all Be\nstars.

First, we model\nthe observations with a dusty wind-blown bubble, and then ask whether dust\ncould survive within N49 to its present age (estimated to be 5x10^5 to 10^6\nyears). We find that dust sputtering and especially dust-gas friction would\nimply relatively short timescales (t ~ 10^4 years) for dust survival in the\nwind-shocked region of the bubble. To explain the 24 micron emission, we\npostulate that the grains are replenished within the wind-blown bubble by\ndestruction of embedded, dense cloudlets of ISM gas that have been over-run by\nthe expanding wind-blown bubble. We calculate the ablation timescales for\ncloudlets within N49 and find approximate parameters for the embedded cloudlets\nthat can replenish the dust; the parameters for the cloudlets are roughly\nsimilar to those observed in other nebula. Such dust will have an important\neffect on the bubble: including simple dust cooling in a wind-blown bubble\nmodel for N49, we find that the luminosity is higher by approximately a factor\nof six at a bubble age of about 10^4 years. At ages of 10^7 years, the energy\ncontained in the bubble is lower by about a factor of eight if dust is\nincluded; if dust must be replenished within the bubble, the associated\naccompanying gas mass will also be very important to wind-blown bubble cooling\nand evolution.

We use an inhomogeneous chemical evolution model for the Galactic\nhalo to predict both the mean trend and scatter of C/O and N/O. In one set of\nmodels, we assume that massive stars enrich the interstellar medium during both\nthe stellar wind and supernovae phases. In the second set, we consider that in\nthe earliest phases (Z <10^-8), stars with masses above 40 Msun only enrich the\ninterstellar medium via stellar winds, collapsing directly into black holes. We\npredict a larger scatter in the C/O and N/O ratios at low metallicities when\nallowing the more massive fast-rotating stars to contribute to the chemical\nenrichment only via stellar winds. The latter assumption, combined with the\nstochasticity in the star formation process in the primordial Galactic halo can\nexplain the wide spread observed in the N/O and C/O ratios in normal\nvery-metal-poor stars. For chemical elements with stellar yields that depend\nstrongly on initial mass (and rotation) such as C, N, and neutron capture\nelements, within the range of massive stars, a large scatter is expected once\nthe stochastic enrichment of the early interstellar medium is taken into\naccount. We also find that stellar winds of fast rotators mixed with\ninterstellar medium gas are not enough to explain the large CNO enhancements\nfound in most of the carbon-enhanced very-metal-poor stars. In particular, this\nis the case of the most metal-poor star known to date, HE 1327-2326, for which\nour models predict lower N enhancements than observed when assuming a mixture\nof stellar winds and interstellar medium.

The grains in the disc are\noriginally of the same size as interstellar dust. Models predict that these\ngrains will grow in size through coagulation. Observations of the silicate\nfeatures at micron wavelengths are consistent with growth to micron sizes\nwhereas the slope of the SED at longer wavelengths traces growth up to mm\nsizes. We here look for a correlation between these two grain growth\nindicators. A large sample of T-Tauri and Herbig-Ae/Be stars was observed with\nthe Spitzer Space Telescope at 5-13 micron; a subsample was observed at mm\nwavelengths. We complement this subsample with data from the literature to\nmaximise the overlap between micron and mm observations and search for\ncorrelations. Synthetic spectra are produced to determine which processes may\nproduce the dust evolution. Dust disc masses in the range <1 to 7 x 10^-4 MSun\nare obtained. Most sources have a mm spectral slope consistent with grain\ngrowth. There is a tentative correlation between the 10-micron silicate feature\nand the mm slope of the SED. The observed sources seem to be grouped per\nstar-forming region in the micron-vs-mm diagram. The modelling results show\nthat the 10-micron feature becomes flatter and subsequently the mm slope\nbecomes shallower. Grain size distributions shallower than that of the ISM\nand/or bright central stars are required to explain specific features. Settling\nof larger grains towards the disc midplane affects the 10-micron feature, but\nhardly the mm slope. The tentative correlation between the strength of the\n10-micron feature and the mm slope suggests that the inner and outer disc\nevolve simultaneously. Dust with a mass dominated by mm-sized grains is\nrequired to explain the shallowest mm slopes. Other processes besides grain\ngrowth may also be responsible for the removal of small grains. \n\n"}

This physical\nmechanism naturally leads to a nonlinear formulation, reproducing the observed\nlight curves of many pulsating white dwarfs. This numerical model can also\nprovide information on the average depth of a star's convection zone and the\ninclination angle of its pulsation axis.

These data are modelled\nusing the JKTEBOP code, and taking into account the light from the\nrecently-discovered faint star close to the system. The physical properties of\nthe WASP-2 system are derived using tabulated predictions from five different\nsets of stellar evolutionary models, allowing both statistical and systematic\nerrorbars to be specified. We find the mass and radius of the planet to be M_b\n= 0.847 +/- 0.038 +/- 0.024 Mjup and R_b = 1.044 +/- 0.029 +/- 0.015 Rjup.

However, there are surprisingly few direct measurements of the local\nmetallicities of different flavors of core-collapse SNe.

We obtain spectra at the SN sites, include SNe from targeted and\nuntargeted surveys, and perform the abundance determinatinos using three\ndifferent oxygen-abundance calibrations. The sites of SNe Ic (the demise of the\nmost heavily stripped stars having lost both the H and He layers) are\nsystematically more metal rich than those of SNe Ib (arising from stars that\nretained their He layer) in all calibrations. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test yields\nthe very low probability of 1% that SN Ib and SN Ic environment abundances,\nwhich are different on average by ~0.2 dex (in the Pettini & Pagel scale), are\ndrawn from the same parent population. Broad-lined SNe Ic (without GRBs) occur\nat metallicities between those of SNe Ib and SNe Ic. Lastly, we find that the\nhost-galaxy central oxygen abundance is not a good indicator of the local SN\nmetallicity; hence, large-scale SN surveys need to obtain local abundance\nmeasurements in order to quantify the impact of metallicity on stellar death. \n\n"}

Using the empirical\nmass-radius relation of CVs and the homologous approximation for changes in\neffective temperature T_2, orbital period P, and luminosity of the donor with\nthe stellar radius, we find the semi-empirical mass-loss rate M2_dot of CVs as\na function of P. The derived M2_dot is at ~10^(-9.5)-10^(-10) Msun/yr and\ndepends weakly on P when P > 90 min, while it declines very rapidly towards the\nminimum period when P < 90 min, emulating the P-T_2 relation. Due to strong\ndeviation from thermal equilibrium caused by the mass loss, the semi-empirical\nM2_dot is significantly different from, and has a less-pronounced turnaround\nbehavior with P than suggested by previous numerical models. The semi-empirical\nP-M2_dot relation is consistent with the angular momentum loss due to\ngravitational wave emission, and strongly suggests that CV secondaries with\n0.075 Msun < M_2 < 0.2 Msun are less than 2 Gyrs old. When applied to selected\neclipsing CVs, our semi-empirical mass-loss rates are in good agreement with\nthe accretion rates derived from the effective temperatures T_1 of white\ndwarfs, suggesting that M2_dot can be used to reliably infer T_2 from T_1.\nBased on the semi-empirical M2_dot, SDSS 1501 and 1433 systems that were\npreviously identified as post-bounce CVs have yet to reach the minimal period. \n\n"}

The\nphotometric behavior of M31-RV (and several other very red novae, i.e. luminous\neruptive red variables) has led to several models of this apparently new class\nof astrophysical object. One of the most detailed models is that of\n\"mergebursts\": hypothetical mergers of close binary stars. These are predicted\nto rival or exceed the brightest classical novae in luminosity, but to be much\ncooler and redder than classical novae, and to become slowly hotter and bluer\nas they age. This prediction suggests two stringent and definitive tests of the\nmergeburst hypothesis. First, there should always be a cool red remnant, and\nNOT a hot blue remnant at the site of such an outburst. Second, the inflated\nenvelope of a mergeburst event should be slowly contracting, hence it must\ndisplay a slowly rising effective temperature. We have located a luminous,\nUV-bright object within 0.4 arcsec (1.5 sigma of the astrometric position) of\nM31-RV in archival WFPC2 images taken 10 years after the outburst: it resembles\nan old nova. Twenty years after the outburst, the object remains much too hot\nto be a mergeburst. Its behavior remains consistent with that of theoretical\nnova models which erupt on a low mass white dwarf.

II.\n  Measuring the Size of the \"Frozen\" Zone Abstract: Coagulation of submicron-sized dust grains into porous aggregates is the\ninitial step of dust evolution in protoplanetary disks. Recently, it has been\npointed out that negative charging of dust in the weakly ionized disks could\nsignificantly slow down the coagulation process. In this paper, we apply the\ngrowth criteria obtained in Paper I to finding out a location (\"frozen\" zone)\nwhere the charging stalls dust growth at the fractal growth stage. For\nlow-turbulence disks, we find that the frozen zone can cover the major part of\nthe disks at a few to 100 AU from the central star. The maximum mass of the\naggregates is approximately 10^{-7} g at 1 AU and as small as a few monomer\nmasses at 100 AU. Strong turbulence can significantly reduce the size of the\nfrozen zone, but such turbulence will cause the fragmentation of macroscopic\naggregates at later stages. We examine a possibility that complete freezeout of\ndust evolution in low-turbulence disks could be prevented by global transport\nof dust in the disks. Our simple estimation shows that global dust transport\ncan lead to the supply of macroscopic aggregates and the removal of frozen\naggregates on a timescale of 10^6 yr. This overturns the usual understanding\nthat tiny dust particles get depleted on much shorter timescales unless\ncollisional fragmentation is effective.

Previous spectroscopic\nanalyses of blue hook stars in omega Cen and NGC 2808 support the late hot\nflasher scenario, but the stars contain much less helium than expected and the\npredicted C and N enrichment cannot be verified. We compare the observed\neffective temperatures, surface gravities, helium abundances, and carbon line\nstrengths (where detectable) of our targets stars with the predictions of the\ntwo aforementioned scenarios. Moderately high resolution spectra of hot HB\nstars in the globular cluster omega Cen were analysed for radial velocity\nvariations, atmospheric parameters, and abundances using LTE and non-LTE model\natmospheres. We find no evidence of close binaries among our target stars. All\nstars below 30,000K are helium-poor and very similar to HB stars observed in\nthat temperature range in other globular clusters. In the temperature range\n30,000K to 50,000K, we find that 28% of our stars are helium-poor (log(He/H) <\n-1.6), while 72% have roughly solar or super-solar helium abundance (log(He/H)\n>= -1.5). We also find that carbon enrichment is strongly correlated with\nhelium enrichment, with a maximum carbon enrichment of 3% by mass. A strong\ncarbon enrichment in tandem with helium enrichment is predicted by the late hot\nflasher scenario, but not by the helium-enrichment scenario.

These grains are\nexpected to carry nonzero negative charges in the weakly ionized disks, but its\neffect on their collisional growth has not been fully understood so far. In\nthis paper, we investigate how the charging affects the evolution of the dust\nsize distribution properly taking into account the charging mechanism in a\nweakly ionized gas as well as porosity evolution through low-energy collisions.\nTo clarify the role of the size distribution, we divide our analysis into two\nsteps. First, we analyze the collisional growth of charged aggregates assuming\na monodisperse (i.e., narrow) size distribution. We show that the monodisperse\ngrowth stalls due to the electrostatic repulsion when a certain condition is\nmet, as is already expected in the previous work. Second, we numerically\nsimulate dust coagulation using Smoluchowski's method to see how the outcome\nchanges when the size distribution is allowed to freely evolve. We find that,\nunder certain conditions, the dust undergoes bimodal growth where only a\nlimited number of aggregates continue to grow carrying the major part of the\ndust mass in the system. This occurs because remaining small aggregates\nefficiently sweep up free electrons to prevent the larger aggregates from being\nstrongly charged.

Recent observations have shown\nthat a number of these planets have highly inclined, sometimes retrograde\norbits about their parent stars, prompting much speculation as to their origin.\nIt is known that migration alone cannot account for the observed population of\nthese misaligned hot Jupiters, which suggests that dynamical processes after\nthe gas disc dissipates play a substantial role in yielding the observed\ninclination and eccentricity distributions. One particularly promising\ncandidate is planet-planet scattering, which is not very well understood in the\nnon-linear regime of tides. Through three-dimensional hydrodynamical\nsimulations of multi-orbit encounters, we show that planets that are scattered\ninto an orbit about their parent stars with closest approach distance being\nless than approximately three times the tidal radius are either destroyed or\ncompletely ejected from the system. We find that as few as 5 and as many as 18\nof the currently known hot Jupiters have a maximum initial apastron for\nscattering that lies well within the ice line, implying that these planets must\nhave migrated either before or after the scattering event that brought them to\ntheir current positions. If stellar tides are unimportant $(Q_\\ast \\gtrsim\n10^7)$, disk migration is required to explain the existence of the hot Jupiters\npresent in these systems.

Here\nwe take the truncated disc/hot inner flow picture which can describe the\nspectral changes, and show that propagating mass accretion rate fluctuations in\nthe hot flow can match the broad band power spectral properties seen in black\nhole binaries, i.e. give approximately band limited noise between a low and\nhigh frequency break. The low frequency break marks the viscous timescale at\nthe outer edge of the hot inner flow, which is the inner edge of the truncated\ndisc. The model also predicts the Lense-Thirring precession timescale of the\nhot flow, as this is set by the surface density of the flow which is self\nconsistently calculated from the propagating fluctuations. We show that this\nnaturally gives the observed relation between the low frequency break and QPO\nfrequency as the outer radius of the flow moves inwards, and that this model\npredicts many of the observed QPO properties such as correlation of coherence\nwith frequency, and of the recently discovered correlation of frequency with\nflux on short timescales.

The singularities that lurk inside the\nhorizon of the usual Kerr-Newman family of black hole solutions signal an\nendpoint to the physical laws and as such should be substituted in one way or\nanother. A proposal that has been around for sometime, is to replace the\nsingular region of the spacetime by a region containing some form of matter or\nfalse vacuum configuration that can also cohabit with the black hole interior.\nBlack holes without singularities are called regular black holes. In the\npresent work regular black hole solutions are found within general relativity\ncoupled to Maxwell's electromagnetism and charged matter.

However, some recent observations showed that the expected number\nof the mass-accreting WD is much lower than that predicted from theory,\nwhatever in spiral or elliptical galaxies. In this paper, we did a binary\npopulation synthesis study on the relative duration of the SSS phase to their\nwhole mass-increasing phase of WDs leading to SNe Ia. We found that for about\n40% progenitor systems, the relative duration is shorter than 2% and the\nevolution of the mean relative duration shows that it is always smaller than\n5%, whatever for young or old SNe Ia. In addition, before SNe Ia explosion,\nmore than 55% progenitor systems are experiencing a dwarf novae phase, and only\nno more than 10% is staying SSS phase. These results are consistent with the\nrecent observations, and imply that both in early- and late-type galaxies, only\na small fraction of mass-accreting WD resulting in SNe Ia contribute to the\nsupersoft X-ray flux. So, although our results are not directly related to the\nX-ray output of SN Ia progenitor, the low supersoft X-ray luminosity observed\nin early type galaxies may have no ability to exclude the validity of SD model.\nOn the contrary, it is evidence to support the SD scenario. \n\n"}

All the previous studies on the core-accretion\nmodel assumed that the envelope has the solar composition uniformly. In fact,\nthe envelope is likely polluted by evaporated materials of icy planetesimals\nbecause icy planetesimals going through the envelope experience mass loss via\nstrong ablation and most of their masses are deposited in the deep envelope.

Being highly non-linear and stochastic, the outcome\nof collapse can only be explored theoretically by performing large ensembles of\nnumerical simulations. Standard practice is to quantify the initial turbulent\nvelocity field in a core in terms of the amount of turbulent energy (or some\nequivalent) and the exponent in the power spectrum (n \\equiv -d log Pk /d log\nk). In this paper, we present a numerical study of the influence of the details\nof the turbulent velocity field on the collapse of an isolated, weakly\nturbulent, low-mass prestellar core. We show that, as long as n > 3 (as is\nusually assumed), a more critical parameter than n is the maximum wavelength in\nthe turbulent velocity field, {\\lambda}_MAX. This is because {\\lambda}_MAX\ncarries most of the turbulent energy, and thereby influences both the amount\nand the spatial coherence of the angular momentum in the core. We show that the\nformation of dense filaments during collapse depends critically on\n{\\lambda}_MAX, and we explain this finding using a force balance analysis. We\nalso show that the core only has a high probability of fragmenting if\n{\\lambda}_MAX > 0.5 R_CORE (where R_CORE is the core radius); that the dominant\nmode of fragmentation involves the formation and break-up of filaments; and\nthat, although small protostellar disks (with radius R_DISK <= 20 AU) form\nroutinely, more extended disks are rare.

The cold, dusty\nclumps surrounding RCW 120 are arranged in an almost spherical shell and\nharbour many young stellar objects. By performing high-resolution,\nthree-dimensional SPH simulations of HII regions expanding into fractal\nmolecular clouds, we investigate whether the formation of massive clumps in\ndense, swept-up shells necessarily requires the C&C mechanism. In a second\nstep, we use RADMC-3D to compute the synthetic dust continuum emission from our\nsimulations, in order to compare them with observations of RCW 120 made with\nAPEX-LABOCA at 870 micron. We show that a distribution of clumps similar to the\none seen in RCW 120 can readily be explained by a non-uniform initial molecular\ncloud structure.

Under the assumption\nthat mm-wave emission of disks is mostly optically thin, these data have been\ngenerally interpreted as evidence for the presence of mm/cm-sized pebbles in\nthe disk outer regions. In this work we investigate the effect of possible\nlocal optically thick regions on the mm-wave emission of protoplanetary disks\nwithout mm/cm-sized grains. A significant local increase of the optical depth\nin the disk can be caused by the concentration of solid particles, as predicted\nto result from a variety of proposed physical mechanisms. We calculate the\nfilling factors and implied overdensities these optically thick regions would\nneed to significantly affect the millimeter fluxes of disks, and we discuss\ntheir plausibility. We find that optically thick regions characterized by\nrelatively small filling factors can reproduce the mm-data of young disks\nwithout requesting emission from mm/cm-sized pebbles.

It is expected that\nan SMS could form via very rapid mass accretion with Mdot ~ 0.1 - 1 Msun/yr\nduring the gravitational collapse of an atomic-cooling primordial gas cloud. In\nthis paper we study how stars would evolve under such extreme rapid mass\naccretion, focusing on the early evolution until the stellar mass reaches 1000\nMsun. To this end we numerically calculate the detailed interior structure of\naccreting stars with primordial element abundances. Our results show that for\naccretion rates higher than 0.01 Msun/yr, stellar evolution is qualitatively\ndifferent from that expected at lower rates. While accreting at these high\nrates the star always has a radius exceeding 100 Rsun, which increases\nmonotonically with the stellar mass. The mass-radius relation for stellar\nmasses exceeding ~ 100 Msun follows the same track with R_* \\propto M_*^0.5 in\nall cases with accretion rates > 0.01 Msun/yr; at a stellar mass of 1000 Msun\nthe radius is about 7000 Rsun (~= 30 AU).

Most studies\nhave so far concentrated on the colder parts (T<30K) of these regions. The aim\nis to characterize the warmer parts of the protostellar envelope in order to\nquantify the feedback of the protostars on their surroundings in terms of\nshocks, UV heating, photodissociation and outflow dispersal. Fully sampled\nlarge scale maps of the region were obtained; APEX-CHAMP+ was used for 12CO\n6-5, 13CO 6-5 and [CI] 2-1, and JCMT-HARP-B for 12CO 3-2 emissions.\nComplementary Herschel-HIFI and ground-based lines of CO and its isotopologs,\nfrom 1-0 upto 10-9 (Eu/k 300K), are collected at the source positions.\nRadiative-transfer models of the dust and lines are used to determine\ntemperatures and masses of the outflowing and UV-heated gas and infer the CO\nabundance structure. Broad CO emission line profiles trace entrained shocked\ngas along the outflow walls, with typical temperatures of ~100K. At other\npositions surrounding the outflow and the protostar, the 6-5 line profiles are\nnarrow indicating UV excitation. The narrow 13CO 6-5 data directly reveal the\nUV heated gas distribution for the first time. The amount of UV-heated and\noutflowing gas are found to be comparable from the 12CO and 13CO 6-5 maps,\nimplying that UV photons can affect the gas as much as the outflows. Weak [CI]\nemission throughout the region indicates a lack of CO dissociating photons.\nModeling of the C18O lines indicates the necessity of a \"drop\" abundance\nprofile throughout the envelope where the CO freezes out and is reloaded back\ninto the gas phase, thus providing quantitative evidence for the CO ice\nevaporation zone around the protostars. The inner abundances are less than the\ncanonical value of CO/H_2=2.7x10^-4, indicating some processing of CO into\nother species on the grains. \n\n"}

We reexamine\nthis problem by considering porosity evolution of dust aggregates. We apply a\nporosity model based on recent N-body simulations of aggregate collisions,\nwhich allows us to study the porosity change upon collision for a wide range of\nimpact energies. As a first step, we neglect collisional fragmentation and\ninstead focus on dust evolution outside the snow line, where the fragmentation\nhas been suggested to be less significant than inside the snow line because of\na high sticking efficiency of icy particles. We show that dust particles can\nevolve into highly porous aggregates (with internal densities of much less than\n0.1 g/cm^3) even if collisional compression is taken into account. We also show\nthat the high porosity triggers significant acceleration in collisional growth.\nThis acceleration is a natural consequence of particles' aerodynamical property\nat low Knudsen numbers, i.e., at particle radii larger than the mean free path\nof the gas molecules. Thanks to this rapid growth, the highly porous aggregates\nare found to overcome the radial drift barrier at orbital radii less than 10 AU\n(assuming the minimum-mass solar nebula model). This suggests that, if\ncollisional fragmentation is truly insignificant, formation of icy\nplanetesimals is possible via direct collisional growth of submicron-sized icy\nparticles. \n\n"}

We find about 8,000 stars that have excess emission, mostly at\n12um. The positions of these stars correlate with the 100um background level so\nmost of the flux measurements associated with these excesses are spurious. We\nidentify 271 stars with plausible excesses by making a 5MJy/sr cut in the IRAS\n100um emission. The number counts of these excesses, at both 12 and 22um, have\nthe same distribution as extra-Galactic number counts. Thus, although some\nexcesses may be circumstellar, most can be explained as chance alignments with\nbackground galaxies. The one exception is a 22um excess associated with a\nrelatively nearby A-type star that we were able to confirm because the disk\noccurrence rate is independent of stellar distance.

(1) Microlensing observations toward the Magellanic\nClouds rule out the Milky Way halo being dominated by MAssive Compact Halo\nObjects (MACHOs). This confirms most dark matter is non-baryonic, consistent\nwith other observations.

A recent study by us,\nviz., that of Banerjee, Kroupa & Oh (2012; Paper I), which involves realistic\nN-body computations of star clusters mimicking R136, indicates that such\n\"super-canonical\" (SC) stars can be formed out of a dense stellar population\nwith a canonical initial mass function (IMF) through dynamically induced\nmergers of the most massive binaries. Here we study the formation of SC stars\nin the R136 models of Paper I in detail. To avoid forming extraneous SC stars\nfrom initially highly eccentric primordial binaries as in Paper I, we compute\nadditional models with only initially circular primordial binaries. We also\ntake into account the mass-evolution of the SC stars using detailed stellar\nevolutionary models that incorporate updated treatments of stellar winds. We\nfind that SC stars begin to form via dynamical mergers of massive binaries from\napprox. 1 Myr cluster age. We obtain SC stars with initial masses up to approx.\n250 M_sun from these computations. Multiple SC stars are found to remain bound\nto the cluster simultaneously within a SC-lifetime. These properties of the\ndynamically formed SC stars are consistent with those observed in R136. In\nfact, the stellar evolutionary models of SC stars imply that had they formed\nprimordially along with the rest of the R136 cluster, i.e., violating the\ncanonical upper limit, they would have evolved below the canonical 150 M_sun\nlimit by approx. 3 Myr, the likely age of R136, and would not have been\nobservable as SC stars at the present time in R136. This strongly supports the\ndynamical formation scenario of the observed SC stars in R136. \n\n"}

A conducting fluid of magnetic Prandtl number Pm=0.01 is driven into\nmotion by the counter-rotation of the two hemispheric walls. The resulting flow\nis of von K\\'arm\\'an type, consisting of a layer of zonal velocity close to the\nouter wall and a secondary meridional circulation. Above a certain forcing\nthreshold, the mean flow is unstable to non-axisymmetric motions within an\nequatorial belt. For fixed forcing above this threshold, we have studied the\ndynamo properties of this flow. The presence of a conducting outer wall is\nessential to the existence of a dynamo at these parameters. We have therefore\nstudied the effect of changing the material parameters of the wall (magnetic\npermeability, electrical conductivity, and thickness) on the dynamo. In common\nwith previous studies, we find that dynamos are obtained only when either the\nconductivity or the permeability is sufficiently large. However, we find that\nthe effect of these two parameters on the dynamo process are different and can\neven compete to the detriment of the dynamo. Our self-consistent approach allow\nus to analyze in detail the dynamo feedback loop. The dynamos we obtain are\ntypically dominated by an axisymmetric toroidal magnetic field and an axial\ndipole component. We show that the ability of the outer shear layer to produce\na strong toroidal field depends critically on the presence of a conducting\nouter wall, which shields the fluid from the vacuum outside. The generation of\nthe axisymmetric poloidal field, on the other hand, occurs in the equatorial\nbelt and does not depend on the wall properties. \n\n"}

The systems include cooling flow (CF)\nclusters of galaxies, core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), planetary nebulae\n(PNe), and common envelope (CE) evolution. The similarities include hot bubbles\ninflated by jets in a bipolar structure, vortices on the sides of the jets,\nvortices inside the inflated bubbles, fragmentation of bubbles to two and more\nbubbles, and buoyancy of bubbles. The activity in many cases is regulated by a\nnegative feedback mechanism. Namely, higher accretion rate leads to stronger\njet activity that in turn suppresses the accretion process.

In the case of\nCF in galaxies and clusters of galaxies we also study the accretion process,\nwhich is most likely by cold clumps, i.e., the cold feedback mechanism.

In particular, how the magnetic field\nobserved in star-forming cores shapes the binary characteristics remains\nrelatively unexplored. We demonstrate numerically, using the ENZO-MHD code,\nthat a magnetic field of the observed strength can drastically change two of\nthe basic quantities of a binary system: the orbital separation and mass ratio\nof the two components. Our calculations focus on the protostellar mass\naccretion phase, after a pair of stellar 'seeds' have already formed. We find\nthat, in dense cores magnetized to a realistic level, the angular momentum of\nthe gas accreted by the protobinary is greatly reduced by magnetic braking.\nAccretion of strongly braked material shrinks the protobinary separation by a\nlarge factor compared to the non-magnetic case. The magnetic braking also\nchanges the evolution of the mass ratio of unequal-mass protobinaries by\nproducing gas of low specific angular momentum that accretes preferentially\nonto the primary rather than the secondary. This is in contrast with the\npreferential mass accretion onto the secondary previously found for\nprotobinaries accreting from an unmagnetized envelope, which tends to drive the\nmass ratio towards unity. In addition, the magnetic field greatly modifies the\nmorphology and dynamics of the protobinary accretion flow. It suppresses the\ncircumstellar and circumbinary disks that feed the protobinary in the\nnon-magnetic case; the binary is fed instead by a fast collapsing pseudodisk\nwhose rotation is strongly braked.

N-body methods are used to\ninvestigate the cluster dynamics and the effect of gravitational interactions\nbetween cluster members on young solar-type stars surrounded by discs.

This sample provides a unique opportunity to\ninvestigate the occurrence of long-term stellar activity cycles for low-mass\nstars.

We have identified periodic signals for 6\nstars, with periods ranging from days to more than 10 years, and find long-term\ntrends for 7 others. Stellar cycles with P > 1 year are present for at least 5%\nof our targets.

This scenario is\nattractive for the progenitor systems of present-day massive globular clusters\n(GCs) which likely had masses M \\gtrsim 10^7\\msun. In such clusters, supernovae\nand stellar winds cannot provide a plausible explanation for the sudden removal\nof the primordial gas reservoir that is required to explain their complex\nchemical enrichment history.\n  In order to consider different regimes in the gas accretion rate onto\nstellar-mass BHs, we consider both the Bondi-Hoyle and Eddington\napproximations. For either model, our results show that the gas can be\nsignificantly depleted within only a few tens of Myrs. This process will affect\nthe distribution of BH masses, and may accelerate the dynamical decoupling of\nthe BH population and, ultimately, their dynamical ejection. Moreover, the\ntimescales for gas depletion are sufficiently short that the accreting BHs\ncould significantly affect the chemistry of subsequent star formation episodes.\n  The gas depletion times and final mass in BHs are sensitive to the assumed\nmodel for the accretion rate, and to the initial mass of the most massive BH\nwhich, in turn, is determined by the upper mass cut-off of the stellar IMF. Our\nresults imply that the remnant accretion history can have an important bearing\non the observed present-day cluster mass-to-light ratio. In particular, we show\nthat an increase of the upper mass cut-off with decreasing metallicity could\ncontribute to the observed anti-correlation between the mass-to-light ratio and\nthe metallicity of GCs. \n\n"}

Terrestrial microlens parallax can\nbe measured whenever a microlensing event differs substantially as observed\nfrom two or more well-separated sites.

First the rate is directly proportional to the number\ndensity of a given population, greatly favoring low-mass populations relative\nto their contribution to the general microlensing rate, which further scales as\nsqrt{M} where M is the lens mass. Second, the rate rises sharply as one probes\nsmaller source stars, despite the fact that the probability of transit falls\ndirectly with source size.

The reddening, a measurement of dust extinction, acts as a tracer\nof the interstellar medium (ISM).\n  Methods: Near infrared photometry of red clump stars are used to measure\nreddening as extinction is the main cause of their colour and magnitude\nvariance.

In order to allow the absolute\nluminosity (or upper limit) of the companion object to be properly calibrated,\nwe undertook astrometric observations with the Very Long Baseline Array to\nconstrain the system distance via a measurement of annual geometric parallax.\nWith these observations, we measure the parallax of the J2222-0137 system to be\n3.742 +0.013 -0.016 milliarcseconds, yielding a distance of 267.3 +1.2 -0.9 pc,\nand measure the transverse velocity to be 57.1 +0.3 -0.2 km/s. Fixing these\nparameters in the pulsar timing model made it possible to obtain a measurement\nof Shapiro delay and hence the system inclination, which shows that the system\nis nearly edge-on (sin i = 0.9985 +/- 0.0005).

These differences can best be explained\nif the onset of high eccentricity planet migration is also a time when planet\nare sent into merge with the star. Planet migration into the star is likely a\ncomplementary explanation to the view that systems with higher initial iron\nabundance form more planets, and that more crowded planets are more likely to\nscatter into eccentric orbits. Planets of iron-rich single stars have\neccentricity distributions that are higher than planets of iron-poor single\nstars (where \"rich\" and \"poor\" are stars whose [Fe/H] is above and below solar,\nrespectively). Stars with planets that have a stellar companion comprise a\nthird population of systems in which the stars are preferentially iron-rich.

Accretion of matter onto the\ncentral star, protostellar winds/jets, magnetic disk winds, and\nphotoevaporative winds operate concurrently. Hence, disentangling their\nrelative contribution to disk dispersal requires identifying diagnostics that\ntrace different star-disk environments. Here, we analyze the low velocity\ncomponent (LVC) of the Oxygen optical forbidden lines, which is found to be\nblueshifted by a few km/s with respect to the stellar velocity. We find that\nthe [OI] LVC profiles are different from those of [NeII] at 12.81\\mu m and CO\nat 4.7\\mu m lines pointing to different origins for these gas lines. We report\na correlation between the luminosity of the [OI] LVC and the accretion\nluminosity Lacc. We do not find any correlation with the X-ray luminosity,\nwhile we find that the higher is the stellar FUV luminosity, the higher is the\nluminosity of the [OI] LVC.

It is found\nthat the mass-radius relationship of the DM admixed neutron stars (DANSs)\ndepends sensitively on the mass of DM candidates, the amount of DM, and\ninteractions among DM candidates. The existence of DM in DANSs results in a\nspread of mass-radius relationships that cannot be interpreted with a unique\nequilibrium sequence.

Although this is a simple and\nrobust approach, a number of drawbacks exist thus making fourth order schemes\ndesirable. A robust and simple finite-difference scheme, which can easily be\nimplemented in either 1D or 2D stellar pulsation codes is therefore required.\n  Aims: One of the difficulties in setting up higher order finite-difference\nschemes for stellar pulsations is the so-called mesh-drift instability. Current\nways of dealing with this defect include introducing artificial viscosity or\napplying a staggered grids approach. However these remedies are not well-suited\nto eigenvalue problems, especially those involving non-dissipative systems,\nbecause they unduly change the spectrum of the operator, introduce\nsupplementary free parameters, or lead to complications when applying boundary\nconditions.\n  Methods: We propose here a new method, inspired from the staggered grids\nstrategy, which removes this instability while bypassing the above\ndifficulties. Furthermore, this approach lends itself to superconvergence, a\nprocess in which the accuracy of the finite differences is boosted by one\norder.\n  Results: This new approach is shown to be accurate, flexible with respect to\nthe underlying grid, and able to remove mesh-drift. \n\n"}

The temperature and density in the\ncentre eventually reach high enough values where fusion reactions can ignite;\nthe protostar is born. This sequence of events entail many physical processes,\nof which radiative transfer is of paramount importance. Many simulations of\nprotostellar collapse make use of a grey treatment of radiative transfer\ncoupled to the hydrodynamics.

We find empirical\nevidence for planetary-induced forcing and modulation of solar activity. Power\nspectra and direct data pattern analysis reveal a clear signature of the\n1.09-year Earth-Jupiter conjunction cycle, in particular during solar cycle 23\nmaximum. This appears to suggest that the Jupiter side of the Sun is slightly\nbrighter during solar maxima. The effect is observed when the Earth crosses the\nSun-Jupiter conjunction line every 1.09 years. Multiple spectral peaks are\nobserved in the TSI records that are coherent with known planetary harmonics\nsuch as the spring, orbital and synodic periods among Mercury, Venus, Earth and\nJupiter: the Mercury-Venus spring-tidal cycle (0.20 year); the Mercury orbital\ncycle (0.24 year); the Venus-Jupiter spring-tidal cycle (0.32 year); the\nVenus-Mercury synodic cycle (0.40 year); the Venus-Jupiter synodic cycle (0.65\nyear); and the Venus-Earth spring tidal cycle (0.80 year). Strong evidence is\nalso found for a 0.5-year TSI cycle that could be driven by the Earth's\ncrossing the solar equatorial plane twice a year and may indicate a latitudinal\nsolar-luminosity asymmetry. Because both spring and synodic planetary cycles\nappear to be present and the amplitudes of their TSI signatures appear enhanced\nduring sunspot cycle maxima, we conjecture that on annual and sub-annual scales\nboth gravitational and electro-magnetic planet-sun interactions and internal\nnon-linear feedbacks may be modulating solar activity.

While it is usually agreed that single-degenerate progenitor\nsystems would be luminous supersoft X-ray sources (SSSs), it was recently\nsuggested that double-degenerate progenitors might also go through a SSS phase.\nAims: We aim to examine the possibility of double-degenerate progenitor systems\nbeing SSSs, and place stringent upper limits on the maximally possible\ndurations of any SSS phases and expected number of these systems in a galactic\npopulation. Method: We employ the binary population synthesis code SeBa to\nexamine the mass-transfer characteristics of a possible SSS phase of\ndouble-degenerate type Ia SN progenitor systems for 1) the standard SeBa\nassumptions, and 2) an optimistic best-case scenario. The latter case\nestablishes firm upper limits on the possible population of supersoft source\ndouble-degenerate type Ia SN progenitor systems. Results: Our results indicate\nthat unlike what is expected for single-degenerate progenitor systems, the vast\nmajority of the material accreted by either pure wind mass transfer or a\ncombination of wind and RLOF mass transfer is helium rather than hydrogen. Even\nwith extremely optimistic assumptions concerning the mass-transfer and\nretention efficiencies, the average mass accreted by systems that eventually\nbecome double-degenerate type Ia SNe is small.

Systems are stable on\nthe MS if the planets are separated by more than ~9 Hill radii.

Mass loss\nat the end of the asymptotic giant branch triggers delayed instability in many\nsystems, leading to instabilities typically occurring at WD cooling ages of a\nfew 100 Myr. This instability occurs both in systems that survived the star's\nprevious evolution unscathed, and in systems that previously underwent\nscattering instabilities.

The dynamical\nejection hypothesis as an origin for its location is claimed improbable by Sana\net al. due to its binary nature and high mass. We demonstrate here by means of\ndirect N-body calculations that a very massive binary system can be readily\ndynamically ejected from a R136-like cluster, through a close encounter with a\nvery massive system. One out of four N-body cluster models produces a\ndynamically ejected very massive binary system with a mass comparable to R144.\nThe system has a system mass of $\\approx$ 355 Msun and is located at 36.8 pc\nfrom the centre of its parent cluster, moving away from the cluster with a\nvelocity of 57 km/s at 2 Myr as a result of a binary-binary interaction.

Of these, the 0.96 Msun dwarf merging with an 0.81 Msun\ncompanion, with a Ni56 yield of 0.58 Msun, is the most promising candidate for\nreproducing common SNe Ia. The more massive mergers produce unusually luminous\nSNe Ia with peak luminosities approaching those attributed to\n\"super-Chandrasekhar\" mass SNe Ia.

We model the observed present day mass functions of the young\nGalactic Arches and Quintuplet star clusters using our rapid binary evolution\ncode.

The only available\nanalytical MHD solutions to describe disc-driven jets are those characterized\nby the symmetry of radial self-similarity. However, radially self-similar MHD\njet models, in general, have three geometrical shortcomings, (i) a singularity\nat the jet axis, (ii) the necessary assumption of axisymmetry, and (iii) the\nnon-existence of an intrinsic radial scale, i.e. the jets formally extend to\nradial infinity. Hence, numerical simulations are necessary to extend the\nanalytical solutions towards the axis, by solving the full three-dimensional\nequations of MHD and impose a termination radius at finite radial distance. We\nfocus here on studying the effects of relaxing the (ii) assumption of\naxisymmetry, i.e. of performing full 3D numerical simulations of a disc-wind\ncrossing all magnetohydrodynamic critical surfaces. We compare the results of\nthese runs with previous axisymmetric 2.5D simulations. The structure of the\nflow in all simulations shows strong similarities. The 3D runs reach a steady\nstate and stay close to axisymmetry for most of the physical quantities, except\nfor the poloidal magnetic field and the toroidal velocity which slightly\ndeviate from axisymmetry.

Whether a\nsystem is chaotic or not can be assessed by the Lyapunov exponents which\nquantify the rate of divergence of nearby trajectories in the system. We have\ndone a numerical case study for a simple toy model of two neutrino flavors with\ntwo momentum states traveling against each other which is known to exhibit\nflavor transition instabilities. We find the leading Lyapunov exponent to be\npositive in all cases, confirming the chaoticity of the system for both the\nnormal and the inverted neutrino mass hierarchy. However, more Lyapunov\nexponents were approximately zero in the inverted hierarchy compared to the\nnormal which has implications for the stability of the system. To investigate\nthis, we have calculated a generalized set of normal modes, the so-called\ncovariant Lyapunov vectors.

Using an N-body code we explore how the\nnumber and sequence of transits vary as functions of observing time and orbital\nparameters. The concept is then generalised thanks to a suite of simulated\ncircumbinary systems. Binaries are constructed from RV surveys of the solar\nneighbourhood. They are then populated with orbiting gas giants, drawn from a\nrange of distributions. The binary population is shown to be compatible with\nthe Kepler eclipsing binary catalogue, indicating that the properties of\nbinaries may be as universal as the initial mass function. These synthetic\nsystems produce transiting circumbinary planets occurring on both eclipsing and\nnon-eclipsing binaries. Simulated planets transiting eclipsing binaries are\ncompared with published Kepler detections. We obtain 1) that planets transiting\nnon-eclipsing binaries probably exist in the Kepler data, 2) that observational\nbiases alone cannot account for the observed over-density of circumbinary\nplanets near the stability limit, implying a physical pile-up, and 3) that the\ndistributions of gas giants orbiting single and binary stars are likely\ndifferent.

Models of photon-dominated regions (PDRs) still fail to fully\nreproduce some of the observed properties, in particular the combination of the\nintensities of different PDR cooling lines together with the chemical\nstratification, as observed e.g. for the Orion Bar PDR. Aims. We aim to\nconstruct a numerical PDR model, KOSMA-\\tau 3D, to simulate full spectral cubes\nof line emission from arbitrary PDRs in three dimensions (3D). The model is to\nreproduce the intensity of the main cooling lines from the Orion Bar PDR and\nthe observed layered structure of the different transitions. Methods.

Using the Mopra radio telescope, we observed the ground\nrotational transitions of HCO+, H13CO+, HCN, H13CN, HNC, and N2H+. These data\nare complemented with near-infrared extinction maps to constrain the column\ndensities, effective dust temperatures derived from Herschel data, and\nNH3-based gas kinetic temperatures.

The\nextinction-normalized integrated line intensities, a proxy for the abundance in\nconstant excitation conditions of optically thin lines, vary within an order of\nmagnitude for a given molecule.

We find that dynamical processing of\na binary population with an initial binary fraction of unity and an initial\nexcess of intermediate/wide separation (100 - 10$^4$ au) binaries does not\nreproduce the observed properties in the field, even in initially dense ($\\sim\n10^3$M$_\\odot$ pc$^{-3}$) star-forming regions.\n  If instead we adopt a field-like population as the initial conditions, most\nbrown dwarf and M-dwarf binaries are dynamically hard and their overall\nfractions and separation distributions are unaffected by dynamical evolution.\nG-dwarf and A-star binaries in the field are dynamically intermediate in our\nsimulated dense regions and dynamical processing does destroy some systems with\nseparations $>$100 au. However, the formation of wide binaries through the\ndissolution of supervirial regions is a strong function of primary mass, and\nthe wide G-dwarf and A-star binaries that are destroyed by dynamical evolution\nin subvirial regions are replenished by the formation of binaries in\nsupervirial regions.

Here we show that for large\ngrains (size >0.1 micron, containing most grain mass) in sufficiently large\nmolecular clouds (radii >1-10 pc, masses >10^4 M_sun), this scale becomes\nlarger than the characteristic sizes of pre-stellar cores (the sonic length),\nso large fluctuations in the dust-to-gas ratio are imprinted on cores. As a\nresult, star clusters and protostellar disks formed in large clouds should\nexhibit significant abundance spreads in the elements preferentially found in\nlarge grains. This naturally predicts populations of carbon-enhanced stars,\ncertain highly unusual stellar populations observed in nearby open clusters,\nand may explain the 'UV upturn' in early-type galaxies. It will also\ndramatically change planet formation in the resulting protostellar disks, by\npreferentially 'seeding' disks with an enhancement in large carbonaceous or\nsilicate grains. The relevant threshold for this behavior scales simply with\ncloud densities and temperatures, making straightforward predictions for\nclusters in starbursts and high-redshift galaxies. Because of the selective\nsorting by size, this process is not necessarily visible in extinction mapping.\nWe also predict the shape of the abundance distribution -- when these\nfluctuations occur, a small fraction of the cores may actually be seeded with\nabundances ~100 times the mean, such that they are almost 'totally metal'\n(Z~1)!

Due to the large pixel scale of Kepler ($\\sim4 arcsec \\:\npx^{-1}$), it is still not clear whether the detected superflares really occur\non the G-type stars. Knowing the origin of such large brightenings is important\nto study their frequency statistics, which are uncertain due to the low number\nof sun-like stars ($T_{eff} = 5600-6000 \\:K$ and $P_{rot} > 10 \\:d$) which are\ncurrently considered to exhibit superflares. We present a complete Kepler data\nanalysis of the sun-like stars KIC10524994 and KIC07133671 (the only two stars\nwithin this subsample of solar twins with flare energies larger than $10^{35}$\nerg; Maehara et al.), regarding superflare properties and a study about their\norigin. We could detect four new superflares within the epoch Maehara et al.\ninvestigated and found 14 superflares in the remaining light curve for\nKIC10524994. Astrometric Kepler data of KIC07133671 show that the photocentre\nis shifted by 0.006 px or 25 mas during the one detected flare. Hence, the\nflare probably originated from another star directed towards the north-east.\nThis lowers the superflare rate of sun-like stars (and hence the Sun) for $E >\n10^{35}$ erg, since this additional star is probably not solar-like. \n\n"}

Though\ncounterintuitive, this assertion follows directly from stellar tidal\ninteraction theory and the evolution of lower mass stars. There is strong\nevidence that chromospheric activity of rapidly rotating young stars may be\nhigh enough to cause mass loss from atmospheres of potentially habitable\nplanets. The removal of atmospheric water is most critical. Tidal breaking in\nbinaries could help reduce magnetic dynamo action and thereby chromospheric\nactivity in favor of life. We call this the Binary Habitability Mechanism\n(BHM), that we suggest allows for water retention at levels comparable to or\nbetter than Earth. We discuss novel advantages that life may exploit, in these\ncases, and suggest that life may even thrive on some circumbinary planets. We\nfind that while many binaries do not benefit from BHM, high quality niches do\nexist for various combinations of stars between 0.55 and 1.0 solar masses. For\na given pair of stellar masses, BHM operates only for certain combinations of\nperiod and eccentricity. Binaries having a solar-type primary seem to be quite\nwell suited niches having wide and distant habitable zones with plentiful water\nand sufficient light for photosynthetic life.

Using the GAIA source density, we estimate that the\nsample size of high proper motion ($>300$ mas yr$^{-1}$) brown dwarfs needed to\nprovide predictable events during the 5 year mission lifetime is surprisingly\nsmall, only of the order of a hundred. This is comparable to the number of high\nproper motion brown dwarfs already known from the work of the UKIDSS Large Area\nSurvey and the all-sky WISE satellite. Provided the relative parallax of the\nlens and the angular Einstein radius can be recovered from astrometric data,\nthen the mass of the lens can be found.

We estimated the required column density and\nfound that planetary evaporation can account for it. We derived a theoretical\nrelationship between the chromospheric emission as measured in the core of the\nCa II H&K lines and the planet gravity. We applied this relationship to a\nsample of transiting systems for which both the stellar Ca II H&K emission and\nthe planetary surface gravity are known and found a good agreement, given the\nvarious sources of uncertainties and the intrinsic variability of the stellar\nemissions and planetary evaporation rates. We consider implications for the\nradial velocity jitter applied to fit the spectroscopic orbits and for the age\nestimates of planetary systems based on the chromospheric activity level of\ntheir host stars. \n\n"}

In preliminary\nanalyses of the Herschel DEBRIS and DUNES surveys, Wyatt et al. (2012) and\nMarshall et al. (2014) identified a tentative correlation between debris and\nlow-mass planets. Here we use the cleanest possible sample out these surveys to\nassess the presence of such a correlation, discarding stars without known ages,\nwith ages < 1 Gyr and with binary companions <100 AU, to rule out possible\ncorrelations due to effects other than planet presence. In our sample of 204\nFGK stars, we do not find evidence that debris disks are more common or more\ndusty around stars harboring high-mass or low-mass planets compared to a\ncontrol sample without identified planets, nor that debris disks are more or\nless common (or more or less dusty) around stars harboring multiple planets\ncompared to single-planet systems.

We find that the discs\naround objects that have formed by fragmentation in discs hosted by Sun-like\nstars (referred to as 'parent' discs and 'parent' stars) are more massive than\nexpected from the ${M}_{\\rm disc}-M_*$ relation (which is derived for stars\nwith masses $M_*>0.2 {\\rm M}_{\\odot}$). Accordingly, the accretion rates onto\nthese objects are also higher than expected from the $\\dot{M}_*-M_*$ relation.\nMoreover there is no significant correlation between the mass of the brown\ndwarf or planet with the mass of its disc nor with the accretion rate from the\ndisc onto it.

The\ndetection rates of infall candidates toward pre-stellar, proto-stellar and\nUCHII clumps are 0.3452, 0.3861 and 0.2152, respectively. The relatively high\ndetection rate of infall candidates toward UCHII clumps indicates that many\nUCHII regions are still accreting matter. The peak column densities and masses\nof the infall candidates, in general, display a increasing trend with\nprogressing evolutionary stages.

The vast majority of the\ndetections of progenitor stars are of type II-P, II-L or IIb with one type Ib\nprogenitor system detected and many more upper limits for progenitors of Ibc\nsupernovae (14). The data for these 45 supernovae progenitors illustrate a\nremarkable deficit of high luminosity stars above an apparent limit of Log L ~=\n5.1 dex.

The possible biases due to the influence of\ncircumstellar dust and sample selection methods are reviewed. It does not\nappear likely that these can explain the missing high mass progenitor stars.\nThis review concludes that the observed populations of supernovae in the local\nUniverse are not, on the whole, produced by high mass (M > ~18Msun) stars.\nTheoretical explosions of model stars also predict that black hole formation\nand failed supernovae tend to occur above M > ~18Msun.

In particular, are the\naccretion rates smoothly declining from the earlier toward later stages or in\nfact characterized by variations such as intermittent bursts? We aim to\ncharacterize the impact of possible accretion variations in a sample of\nembedded protostars by measuring the size of the inner regions of their\nenvelopes where CO is sublimated and relate those to their temperature profiles\ndictated by their current luminosities. Using observations from the\nSubmillimeter Array we measure the extents of the emission from the C18O\nisotopologue toward 16 deeply embedded protostars. We compare these\nmeasurements to the predicted extent of the emission given the current\nluminosities of the sources through dust and line radiative transfer\ncalculations. Eight out of sixteen sources show more extended C18O emission\nthan predicted by the models. The modeling shows that the likely culprit for\nthese signatures is sublimation due to increases in luminosities of the sources\nby about a factor five or more during the recent 10,000 years - the time it\ntakes for CO to freeze-out again on dust grains. For four of those sources the\nincrease would have had to have been a factor 10 or more. The compact emission\nseen toward the other half of the sample suggests that C18O only sublimates\nwhen the temperature exceeds 30 K - as one would expect if CO is mixed with H2O\nin the grain ice-mantles. The small-number statistics from this survey suggest\nthat protostars undergo significant bursts about once every 20,000 years.

The column\ndensity PDF power law tails at these times have line of sight averaged slopes\nranging from -2.5 to -1.5 with shallower values belonging to simulations with\nlower magnetic field strength. The density power spectrum slope becomes shallow\nand can be characterized by $P(k)=A_1k^{\\beta_2}e^{-k/k_c}$, where $A_1$\ndescribes the amplitude, $k^{\\beta_2}$ describes the classical power law\nbehavior and the scale $k_c$ characterizes the turn over from turbulence\ndominated to self-gravity dominated.

Most O stars are\nhowever found in multiple systems. By establishing the spin-rate distribution\nof a sizeable sample of O-type spectroscopic binaries and by comparing the\ndistributions of binary sub-populations with one another as well as with that\nof presumed single stars in the same region, we aim to constrain the initial\nspin distribution of O stars in binaries, and to identify signatures of the\nphysical mechanisms that affect the evolution of the massive stars spin rates.\nWe use ground-based optical spectroscopy obtained in the framework of the\nVLT-FLAMES Tarantula Survey (VFTS) to establish the projected equatorial\nrotational velocities (\\vrot) for components of 114 spectroscopic binaries in\n30 Doradus.

In an earlier work we showed that at very low temperatures and high\ndensities, H2 can be in a phase transition leading to the formation of ice\nclumps as large as comets or even planets. However, He has very different\nchemical properties and no phase transition is expected before H2 in dense\ninterstellar medium (ISM) conditions. The gravitational stability of fluid\nmixtures has been studied before, but these studies did not include a phase\ntransition.\n  First, we study the gravitational stability of van der Waals fluid mixtures\nusing linearized analysis and examine virial equilibrium conditions using the\nLennard-Jones intermolecular potential. Then, combining the Lennard-Jones and\ngravitational potentials, the non-linear dynamics of fluid mixtures are studied\nvia computer simulations using the molecular dynamics code LAMMPS.\n  Along with the classical, ideal-gas Jeans instability criterion, a fluid\nmixture is always gravitationally unstable if it is in a phase transition\nbecause compression does not increase pressure. However, the condensed phase\nfraction increases. In unstable situations the species can separate: in some\nconditions He precipitates faster than H2, while in other conditions the\nconverse occurs. Also, for an initial gas phase collapse the geometry is\nessential. Contrary to spherical or filamentary collapses, sheet-like collapses\nstarting below 15K easily reach H2 condensation conditions because then they\nare fastest and both the increase of heating and opacity are limited.\n  Depending on density, temperature and mass, either rocky H2 planetoids, or\ngaseous He planetoids form. H2 planetoids are favoured by high density, low\ntemperature and low mass, while He planetoids need more mass and can form at\ntemperature well above the critical value. \n\n"}

We examine the impact of\nthe uncertainties of the two neutron sources operating in low-mass asymptotic\ngiant branch (AGB) stars: the 13C(alpha, n)16O reaction, which releases\nneutrons radiatively during interpulse periods (kT ~ 8 keV), and the\n22Ne(alpha, n)25Mg reaction, partially activated during the convective thermal\npulses (TPs). We focus our attention on the branching points that mainly\ninfluence the abundance of s-only isotopes. In our AGB models, the 13C is fully\nconsumed radiatively during interpulse. In this case, we find that the present\nuncertainty associated to the 13C(alpha, n)16O reaction has marginal effects on\ns-only nuclei. On the other hand, a reduction of this rate may increase the\namount of residual (or unburned) 13C at the end of the interpulse: in this\ncondition, the residual 13C is burned at higher temperature in the convective\nzone powered by the following TP.

This results in an\nextended main sequence turn-off (eMSTO) that appears at young ages\n($\\sim30$~Myr) and lasts beyond 1~Gyr. If this eMSTO is interpreted as an age\nspread, the resulting age spread is proportional to the age of the cluster,\ni.e. young clusters ($<100$~Myr) appear to have small age spreads (10s of Myr)\nwhereas older clusters ($\\sim1$~Gyr) appear to have much larger spreads, up to\na few hundred Myr.

Reconnection is as ubiquitous as plasmas themselves,\nwith solar flares perhaps the most popular example. Over the last few years,\nthe theoretical understanding of magnetic reconnection in large-scale fluid\nsystems has undergone a major paradigm shift. The steady-state model of\nreconnection described by the famous Sweet-Parker (SP) theory, which dominated\nthe field for ~50 years, has been replaced with an essentially time-dependent,\nbursty picture of the reconnection layer, dominated by the continuous formation\nand ejection of multiple secondary islands (plasmoids). Whereas in the SP model\nreconnection was predicted to be slow, a major implication of this new paradigm\nis that reconnection in fluid systems is fast (i.e., independent of the\nLundquist number), provided that the system is large enough. This conceptual\nshift hinges on the realization that SP-like current layers are violently\nunstable to the plasmoid instability - implying, therefore, that such current\nsheets are super-critically unstable and thus can never form in the first\nplace. This suggests that the formation of a current sheet and the subsequent\nreconnection process cannot be decoupled, as is commonly assumed. This paper\nprovides an introductory-level overview of the recent developments in\nreconnection theory and simulations that led to this essentially new framework.\nWe briefly discuss the role played by the plasmoid instability in selected\napplications, and describe some of the outstanding challenges that remain at\nthe frontier of this subject.

Aims: In this paper, we study two\ncarefully selected post-AGB stars in the LMC. The combination of favourable\natmospheric parameters for detailed abundance studies and their known distances\nmake these objects ideal probes of the internal AGB third dredge-up and\ns-process nucleosynthesis in that they provide observational constraints for\ntheoretical AGB models. Methods: We use high-resolution optical UVES spectra to\ndetermine accurate stellar parameters and perform detailed elemental abundance\nstudies. Additionally, we use available photometric data to construct SEDs for\nreddening and luminosity determinations. We then estimate initial masses from\ntheoretical post-AGB tracks. Results: Both stars show extreme s-process\nenrichment associated with relatively low C/O ratios of about 1.3. We could\nonly derive upper limits of the lead (Pb) abundance which indicate no strong Pb\noverabundances with respect to other s-elements.

However, the mass accretion process onto\nCO WDs is still not completely understood. In this paper, we study the\naccretion of He-rich matter onto CO WDs and explore a scenario in which a\nstrong wind forms on the surface of the WD if the total luminosity exceeds the\nEddington limit. Using a stellar evolution code called modules for experiments\nin stellar astrophysics (MESA), we simulated the He accretion process onto CO\nWDs for WDs with masses of 0.6-1.35Msun and various accretion rates of\n10^{-8}-10^{-5}Msun/yr. If the contribution of the total luminosity is included\nwhen determining the Eddington accretion rate, then a super-Eddington wind\ncould be triggered at relatively lower accretion rates than those of previous\nstudies based on steady-state models. The super-Eddington wind can prevent the\nWDs with high accretion rates from evolving into red-giant-like He stars. We\nfound that the contributions from thermal energy of the WD are non-negligible,\njudging by our simulations, even though the nuclear burning energy is the\ndominating source of luminosity.

Sintering is known to reduce\nthe sticking efficiency of dust aggregates and occurs at temperatures slightly\nbelow the sublimation point of their constituent material. We here present a\ndust growth model incorporating sintering and use it to simulate global dust\nevolution due to sintering, coagulation, fragmentation, and radial inward drift\nin a modeled HL Tau disk. We show that aggregates consisting of multiple\nspecies of volatile ices experience sintering, collisionally disrupt, and pile\nup at multiple locations slightly outside the snow lines of the volatiles. At\nwavelengths of 0.87--1.3 mm, these sintering zones appear as bright, optically\nthick rings with a spectral slope of $\\approx 2$, whereas the non-sintering\nzones as darker, optically thinner rings of a spectral slope of $\\approx$\n2.3--2.5.

A minimum level of nuclear activity is thought to be necessary\n--- but not sufficient --- for planets to be habitable. Extending previous work\nthat focused on short-lived nuclei, this paper considers the delivery of\nlong-lived radioactive nuclei to circumstellar disks in star forming regions.\nAlthough the long-lived nuclear species are always present, their abundances\ncan be enhanced through multiple mechanisms. Most stars form in embedded\ncluster environments, so that disks can be enriched directly by intercepting\nejecta from supernovae within the birth clusters. In addition, molecular clouds\noften provide multiple episodes of star formation, so that nuclear abundances\ncan accumulate within the cloud; subsequent generations of stars can thus\nreceive elevated levels of radioactive nuclei through this distributed\nenrichment scenario. This paper calculates the distribution of additional\nenrichment for $^{40}$K, the most abundant of the long-lived radioactive\nnuclei. We find that distributed enrichment is more effective than direct\nenrichment. For the latter mechanism, ideal conditions lead to about 1 in 200\nsolar systems being directly enriched in $^{40}$K at the level inferred for the\nearly solar nebula (thereby doubling the abundance). For distributed enrichment\nfrom adjacent clusters, about 1 in 80 solar systems are enriched at the same\nlevel. Distributed enrichment over the entire molecular cloud is more\nuncertain, but can be even more effective. \n\n"}

The molecular gas distribution of these lines mainly\npeaks in the continuum position of W51 North, and has a small tail extending to\nthe west, probably associated with W51 d2. In addition to the commonly detected\nnitrogen and oxygen-bearing species, we detected a large amount of transitions\nof the Acetone (CH$_3$COCH$_3$) and Methyl Formate (CH$_3$OCHO), which may\nsuggest that these molecules are present in an early evolutionary stage of the\nmassive stars.

We conduct a\nlarge population synthesis study, including the octupole gravitational\npotential from the stellar companion, mutual precession of the host stellar\nspin axis and planet orbital axis, tidal dissipation in the planet, and stellar\nspin-down in the host star due to magnetic braking. We consider a range of\nplanet masses ($0.3-5\\,M_J$) and initial semi-major axes ($1-5$AU), different\nproperties for the host star, and varying tidal dissipation strengths. The\nfraction of systems that result in HJs depends on planet mass and stellar type,\nwith $f_{\\rm HJ} = 1-4\\%$ (depending on tidal dissipation strength) for\n$M_p=1\\,M_J$, and larger (up to $8\\%$) for more massive planets.

These\nsimulations allow us to make substantial progress in mapping out the asymmetric\nthree-dimensional GHZ and its time evolution for the Milky Way (MW) and\nTriangulum (M33) galaxies, as opposed to works that generally assume an\nazimuthally symmetric GHZ.\n  Applying typical habitability metrics to MW and M33, we find that while a\nlarge number of habitable planets exist as close as a few kiloparsecs from the\ngalactic centre, the probability of individual planetary systems being\nhabitable rises as one approaches the edge of the stellar disc. Tidal streams\nand satellite galaxies also appear to be fertile grounds for habitable planet\nformation.\n  In short, we find that both galaxies arrive at similar GHZs by different\nevolutionary paths, as measured by the first and third quartiles of surviving\nbiospheres.

Early superhumps in\nthe superoutburst light curve were absent, and a precursor was observed at the\nonset of the superoutburst for the first time in WZ Sge-type dwarf novae. The\npresent superoutburst can be interpreted as a result of the condition that the\ndisk radius barely reached the 3:1 resonance radius, but did not reach the 2:1\nresonance one. Ordinary superhumps immediately grew following the precursor.\nThe initial part of the outburst is indistinguishable from those of\nsuperoutbursts of ordinary SU UMa-type dwarf novae. This observation supports\nthe interpretation that the 2:1 resonance suppresses a growth of ordinary\nsuperhumps. The estimated superhump period and superhump period derivative are\n$P_{\\rm sh}$ = 0.0573185(11) d and $P_{\\rm dot} = +1.5(3.1) \\times 10^{-5}$,\nrespectively.

In\nthese systems, some of the open field lines do not allow the flow to pass\nsmoothly through the sonic point, so that steady-state solutions do not exist\nin general. This paper focuses on this type of magnetic field configuration,\nwhere the resulting flow becomes manifestly time-dependent. We consider the\ncase of both steady heating and time-variable heating, and find the time scales\nfor the corresponding time variations of the outflow. Because the flow cannot\npass through the sonic transition, it remains subsonic and leads to so-called\nbreeze solutions. One manifestation of the time variability is that the flow\nsamples a collection of different breeze solutions over time, and the mass\noutflow rate varies in quasi-periodic fashion. Because the flow is subsonic,\ninformation can propagate inward from the outer boundary, which determines, in\npart, the time scale of the flow variability. This work finds the relationship\nbetween the outer boundary scale and the time scale of flow variations. In\npractice, the location of the outer boundary is set by the extent of the sphere\nof influence of the planet.

The growth of grains and their inward drift leaves a distinct\nimprint on the dust surface-density distribution and the resulting\nsurface-brightness profile of the thermal continuum emission. We determine the\nsurface-brightness profile of the continuum emission using resolved\nobservations at millimeter wavelengths of the disk around TW Hya, and infer the\nsignature of dust evolution on the surface density and dust opacity. Archival\nALMA observations at 820 micron on baselines up to 410 kilolambda are compared\nto parametrized disk models to determine the surface-brightness profile. Under\nthe assumption of a constant dust opacity, a broken radial power law best\ndescribes the dust surface density, with a slope of -0.53 +/- 0.01 from the 4.1\nau radius of the (already known) inner hole to a turn-over radius of 47.1 +/-\n0.2 au, steepening to -8.0 +/- 0.1 at larger radii. The emission drops below\nthe detection limit beyond ~60 au. The shape of the dust surface density is\nconsistent with theoretical expectations for grain growth, fragmentation, and\ndrift, but its total dust content and its turn-over radius are too large for TW\nHya's age of 8-10 Myr even when taking into account a radially varying dust\nopacity.

I.\n  H/He-Dominated Atmospheres Abstract: The ubiquity of M dwarfs, combined with the relative ease of detecting\nterrestrial-mass planets around them, has made them prime targets for finding\nand characterising planets in the \"Habitable Zone\" (HZ). However, Kepler finds\nthat terrestrial-mass exoplanets are often born with voluminous H/He envelopes,\ncomprising mass-fractions ($M_{env}/M_{core}$) $\\gtrsim 1$%. If these planets\nretain such envelopes over Gyr timescales, they will not be \"habitable\" even\nwithin the HZ. Given the strong X-ray/UV fluxes of M dwarfs, we study whether\nsufficient envelope mass can be photoevaporated away for these planets to\nbecome habitable. We improve upon previous work by using hydrodynamic models\nthat account for radiative cooling as well as the transition from hydrodynamic\nto ballistic escape. Adopting a template active M dwarf XUV spectrum, including\nstellar evolution, and considering both evaporation and thermal evolution, we\nshow that: (1) the mass-loss is (considerably) lower than previous estimates\nthat use an \"energy-limited\" formalism and ignore the transition to Jeans\nescape, (2) at the inner edge of the HZ, planets with core mass $\\lesssim 0.9$\nM$_\\oplus$, can lose enough H/He to become habitable if their initial envelope\nmass-fraction is $\\sim$1%, (3) at the outer edge of the HZ, evaporation cannot\nremove a $\\sim$1% H/He envelope even from cores down to 0.8 M$_\\oplus$.

We further aim to\ndetermine the effect of H2O line cooling on the energy balance in the inner\ncircumstellar envelope. We use two radiative-transfer codes to model molecular\nemission lines of CO and H2O towards four M-type AGB stars. We focus on\nspectrally resolved observations of CO and H2O from HIFI. The observations are\ncomplemented by ground-based CO observations, and spectrally unresolved CO and\nH2O observations with PAC. The observed line profiles constrain the velocity\nstructure throughout the circumstellar envelopes (CSEs), while the CO\nintensities constrain the temperature structure in the CSEs. The H2O\nobservations constrain the o-H2O and p-H2O abundances relative to H2. Finally,\nthe radiative-transfer modelling allows to solve the energy balance in the CSE,\nin principle including also H2O line cooling. The fits to the line profiles\nonly set moderate constraints on the velocity profile, indicating shallower\nacceleration profiles in the winds of M-type AGB stars than predicted by\ndynamical models, while the CO observations effectively constrain the\ntemperature structure. Including H2O line cooling in the energy balance was\nonly possible for the low-mass-loss-rate objects in the sample, and required an\nad hoc adjustment of the dust velocity profile in order to counteract extreme\ncooling in the inner CSE.

Trends\n  of element ratios with stellar age Abstract: A previous study of correlations between element abundance ratios, [X/Fe],\nand ages of solar twin stars is extended to include Sc, Mn, Cu, and Ba. HARPS\nspectra with S/N > 600 are used to derive very precise (+/- 0.01 dex)\ndifferential abundances, and stellar ages with internal errors less than 1 Gyr\nare obtained by interpolation in the logg - Teff diagram between isochrones\ncalculated with the Aarhus Stellar Evolution Code. For stars younger than 6\nGyr, [X/Fe] is tightly correlated with stellar age for all elements. For ages\nbetween 6 and 9 Gyr, the [X/Fe] - age correlations break down and the stars\nsplit up into two groups having respectively high and low [X/Fe] for the odd-Z\nelements. It is concluded that while stars in the solar neighborhood younger\nthan about 6 Gyr were formed from interstellar gas with a smooth chemical\nevolution, older stars have originated from regions enriched by supernovae with\ndifferent neutron excesses. Furthermore, the correlations between abundance\nratios and stellar age suggest that: i) Sc is made in Type II supernovae along\nwith the alpha-capture elements, ii) the Type II to Ia SNe yield ratio is about\nthe same for Mn and Fe, iii) Cu is mainly made by the weak s-process in massive\nstars, iv) the Ba/Y yield ratio for AGB stars increases with decreasing stellar\nmass, v) [Y/Mg] and [Y/Al] can be used as \"chemical clocks\" when determining\nages of solar metallicity stars. \n\n"}

Meanwhile, recent\nhydrodynamical simulations have indicated that the accretion-induced collapse\nmay be avoided under certain conditions when double WDs merge violently.\nHowever, the properties of SNe Ia from this violent merger scenario are highly\ndependent on a particular mass-accretion stage, the so-called WD + He subgiant\nchannel, during which the primary WD is able to increase its mass by accreting\nHe-rich material from a He subgiant before the systems evolves into a double WD\nsystem. In this article, we aim to study this particular evolutionary stage\nsystematically and give the properties of violent WD mergers. By employing the\nEggleton stellar evolution code, we followed a large number of binary\ncalculations and obtained the regions in parameter space for producing violent\nmergers based on the WD + He subgiant channel. According to these simulations,\nwe found that the primary WDs can increase their mass by ~0.10-0.45 Msun during\nthe mass-accretion stage.

Efficient pebble\naccretion is likely to be unavoidable in transition disc dust traps, as the\nsize of the dust particles required for pebble accretion are those which are\nmost efficiently trapped in the transition disc dust trap. Rapid pebble\naccretion within the dust trap gives rise, not only to low-mass planets, but to\na large accretion luminosity. This accretion luminosity is sufficient to heat\nthe disc outside the gravitational influence of the planet and makes the disc\nlocally baroclinic, and a source of vorticity. Using numerical simulations we\ndemonstrate that this source of vorticity can lead to the growth of a single\nlarge scale vortex in $\\sim 100$ orbits, which is capable of trapping\nparticles.

In the present paper\nwe discuss how the extremely metal-poor halo star TYC 8442-1036-1, for which we\nhave now obtained detailed abundances from VLT-UVES spectra, fits into the\nframework of our previous work.

We find an abundance of [Fe/H]=\n$-$3.5 $\\pm$0.13 dex based on our high resolution spectrum; this points to an\niron content lower by a factor of three (0.5 dex) compared to the one obtained\nby a low resolution spectrum.

The leading hypothesis is that such a supernova is a\nthermonuclear explosion of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf, but the exact explosion\nmechanism is still a matter of debate. Observation of a galactic SN Ia would be\nof immense value in answering the many open questions related to these events.\nOne potentially useful source of information about the explosion mechanism and\nprogenitor is the neutrino signal.\n  In this paper we compute the expected neutrino signal from a gravitationally\nconfined detonation (GCD) explosion scenario for a SN~Ia and show how the flux\nat Earth contains features in time and energy unique to this scenario.

We\ninvestigate the gas and dust evolution simultaneously assuming simplified\nprescriptions for a dead zone and a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wind acting on\nthe disk. We explore whether the resulting gas and dust distribution can create\nsignatures similar to those observed in transition disks. For the dust\nevolution, we included the transport, growth, and fragmentation of dust\nparticles. To compare with observations, we produced synthetic images in\nscattered optical light and in thermal emission at mm wavelengths. In all\nmodels with a dead zone, a bump in the gas surface density is produced that is\nable to efficiently trap large particles ($\\gtrsim 1$ mm) at the outer edge of\nthe dead zone.

The\nphysical and chemical evolutions are followed until the end of the main\naccretion phase. When mass averaged over the whole disk, a forming disk has a\nsimilar H2O abundance and HDO/H2O abundance ratio as their precollapse values\n(within a factor of 2), regardless of time in our models. Consistent with\nprevious studies, our models suggest that interstellar water ice is delivered\nto forming disks without significant alteration. On the other hand, the local\nvertically averaged H2O ice abundance and HDO/H2O ice ratio can differ more, by\nup to a factor of several, depending on time and distance from a central star.\nKey parameters for the local variations are the fluence of stellar UV photons\nen route into the disk and the ice layered structure, the latter of which is\nmostly established in the prestellar stages. We also find that even if\ninterstellar water ice is destroyed by stellar UV and (partly) reformed prior\nto disk entry, the HDO/H2O ratio in reformed water ice is similar to the\noriginal value.

Our\nnewly constructed sample contains 91 nebular spectra of 38 SNe IIP, which is\nthe largest dataset of its kind ever analysed in one study, and many of the\nobjects have complementary photometric data. We determined the peak and total\nluminosity, velocity of the peak, HWHM intensity, and profile shape for many\nemission lines. Temporal evolution of these values and various flux ratios are\nstudied. We also investigate the correlations between these measurements and\nphotometric observables, such as the peak and plateau absolute magnitudes and\nthe late-time light curve decline rates in various optical bands. The strongest\nand most robust result we find is that the luminosities of all spectral\nfeatures (except those of helium) tend to be higher in objects with steeper\nlate-time V-band decline rates. A steep late-time V-band slope likely arises\nfrom less efficient trapping of gamma-rays and positrons, which could be caused\nby multidimensional effects such as clumping of the ejecta or asphericity of\nthe explosion itself. Furthermore, if gamma-rays and positrons can escape more\neasily, then so can photons via the observed emission lines, leading to more\nluminous spectral features. It is also shown that SNe IIP with larger\nprogenitor stars have ejecta with a more physically extended oxygen layer that\nis well-mixed with the hydrogen layer. In addition, we find a subset of objects\nwith evidence for asymmetric Ni-56 ejection, likely bipolar in shape.

We determined a NLTE Li abundance\nof 1.52 dex, which is four times higher than what would be expected for the age\nof HIP 68468.

In a passively evolving binary model (meaning no binary\ninteractions), with a flat mass ratio distribution and a Salpeter IMF, the\nresulting 90% confidence upper limit on the initial binary fraction of F<63% is\nin considerable tension with observed massive binary statistics.

In disks around Herbig Ae stars ($T_{\\mathrm{*}}\\sim$\n10,000K, $M_{\\mathrm{*}}\\gtrsim$ 2.5$M_{\\bigodot}$), the position of the\nH$_{2}$O snowline is further from the central star compared with that around\ncooler, and less massive T Tauri stars. Thus, the H$_{2}$O emission line fluxes\nfrom the region within the H$_{2}$O snowline are expected to be stronger. In\nthis paper, we calculate the chemical composition of a Herbig Ae disk using\nchemical kinetics. Next, we calculate the H$_{2}$O emission line profiles, and\ninvestigate the properties of candidate water lines across a wide range of\nwavelengths (from mid-infrared to sub-millimeter) that can locate the position\nof the H$_{2}$O snowline.

X-ray binaries contain accreting neutron stars\nand stellar--mass black holes which are the end points of massive star\nevolution. Studying these remnants thus provides clues to understanding the\nevolutionary processes that lead to their formation. We focus here on the\ndistributions of dynamical masses, space velocities and chemical anomalies of\ntheir companion stars. These three observational features provide unique\ninformation on the physics of core collapse and supernovae explosions within\ninteracting binary systems. There is suggestive evidence for a gap between ~2-5\nMsun in the observed mass distribution. This might be related to the physics of\nthe supernova explosions although selections effects and possible systematics\nmay be important. The difference between neutron star mass measurements in\nlow-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) and pulsar masses in high-mass X-ray binaries\n(HMXBs) reflect their different accretion histories, with the latter presenting\nvalues close to birth masses. On the other hand, black holes in LMXBs appear to\nbe limited to <~12 Msun because of strong mass-loss during the wind Wolf-Rayet\nphase. Detailed studies of a limited sample of black-hole X-ray binaries\nsuggest that the more massive black holes have a lower space velocity, which\ncould be explained if they formed through direct collapse. Conversely, the\nformation of low-mass black holes through a supernova explosion implies that\nlarge escape velocities are possible through ensuing natal and/or Blaauw kicks.\nFinally, chemical abundance studies of the companion stars in seven X-ray\nbinaries indicate they are metal-rich (all except GRO J1655-40) and possess\nlarge peculiar abundances of alpha-elements (Abridged) \n\n"}

For WASP-13, observations have shown that\nthe apparent lack of activity is possibly caused by absorption from the\nintervening ISM. Inspired by this result, we study the effect of ISM absorption\non activity measurements (S and logR'$_{\\rm HK}$ indices) for main-sequence\nlate-type stars. To this end, we employ synthetic stellar photospheric spectra\ncombined with varying amounts of chromospheric emission and ISM absorption. We\npresent the effect of ISM absorption on activity measurements by varying\nseveral instrumental, stellar, and ISM parameters. We find that for relative\nvelocities between the stellar and ISM lines smaller than 30-40 km/s and for\nISM CaII column densities logN$_{\\rm CaII}$>12, the ISM absorption has a\nsignificant influence on activity measurements. Direct measurements and three\ndimensional maps of the Galactic ISM absorption indicate that an ISM CaII\ncolumn density of logN$_{\\rm CaII}$=12 is typically reached by a distance of\nabout 100 pc along most sight lines. In particular, for a Sun-like star lying\nat a distance greater than 100 pc, we expect a depression (bias) in the\nlogR'$_{\\rm HK}$ value larger than 0.05-0.1 dex, about the same size as the\ntypical measurement and calibration uncertainties on this parameter.

We also consider the effect\nof multiple ISM absorption components. We discuss the relevance of this result\nfor exoplanet studies. \n\n"}

We modelled the spectra using resolved\nHST colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), as well as theoretical isochrones, in\ncombination with standard stellar atmosphere and spectral synthesis codes.

The typical differences between iron\nabundances derived from our integrated-light spectra and those compiled from\nthe literature are less than 0.1 dex. A larger difference is found for one\ncluster (NGC 6752), and is most likely caused primarily by stochastic\nfluctuations in the numbers of bright red giants within the scanned area. As\nexpected, the alpha-elements (Ca, Ti) are enhanced by about 0.3 dex compared to\nthe Solar-scaled composition, while the [Cr/Fe] ratios are close to Solar.

Two scenarios have been\nsuggested for both phenomena: one of them involves rapid rotation and\nquasi-chemical homogeneous evolution (CHE), the other invokes classical\nevolution through mass loss in single and binary systems. WR spin rates might\nenable us to test these two scenarios. In order to obtain empirical constraints\non black hole progenitor spin, we infer wind asymmetries in all 12 known WR\nstars in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) at Z = 1/5 Zsun, as well as within a\nsignificantly enlarged sample of single and binary WR stars in the Large\nMagellanic Cloud (LMC at Z = 1/2 Zsun), tripling the sample of Vink (2007).\nThis brings the total LMC sample to 39, making it appropriate for comparison to\nthe Galactic sample.

As WR mass loss is likely Z-dependent, our\nMagellanic Cloud line-effect WR stars may maintain their surface rotation and\nfulfill the basic conditions for producing long GRBs, both via the classical\npost-red supergiant (RSG) or luminous blue variable (LBV) channel, as well as\nresulting from CHE due to physics specific to very massive stars (VMS). \n\n"}

We use the stellar evolution code MESA to\ncompute models with atomic diffusion--with and without radiative\nacceleration--and extra mixing in the surface layers. The extra mixing consists\nof both density-dependent turbulent mixing and envelope overshoot mixing. Based\non these models we argue that it is important to distinguish between initial,\nbulk abundances (parameters) and current, surface abundances (variables) in the\nanalysis of individual stellar ages. In stars that maintain radiative regions\non evolutionary timescales, atomic diffusion modifies the surface abundances.\nWe show that when initial, bulk metallicity is equated with current, surface\nmetallicity in isochrone age analysis the resulting stellar ages can be\nsystematically over-estimated by up to 20%. The change of surface abundances\nwith evolutionary phase also complicates chemical tagging, the concept that\ndispersed star clusters can be identified through unique, high-dimensional\nchemical signatures. Stars from the same cluster, but in different evolutionary\nphases, will show different surface abundances. We speculate that calibration\nof stellar models may allow us to estimate not only stellar ages but also\ninitial abundances for individual stars.

Traditionally, super-stellar elemental abundances in giant\nplanets were thought to be possible due to accretion of metal-rich solids. Such\nenrichments are accompanied by oxygen-rich compositions (i.e. C/O below the\ndisc's value, assumed to be solar, C/O=0.54). Without solid accretion the\nplanets are expected to have sub-solar metallicity, but high C/O ratios. This\narises because the solids are dominated by oxygen-rich species, e.g. H$_2$O and\nCO$_2$, which freeze out in the disk earlier than CO, leaving the gas metal\npoor but carbon-rich. Here we demonstrate that super-solar metallicities can be\nachieved by gas accretion alone when growth and radial drift of pebbles are\nconsidered in protoplanetary discs. Through this mechanism planets may\nsimultaneously acquire super-solar metallicities and super-solar C/O ratios.\nThis happens because the pebbles transport volatile species inward as they\nmigrate through the disc, enriching the gas at snow lines where the volatiles\nsublimate. Furthermore, the planet's composition can be used to constrain where\nit formed. Since high C/H and C/O ratios cannot be created by accreting solids,\nit may be possible to distinguish between formation via pebble accretion and\nplanetesimal accretion by the level of solid enrichment. Finally, we expect\nthat Jupiter's C/O ratio should be near or above solar if its enhanced carbon\nabundance came through accreting metal rich gas. Thus Juno's measurement of\nJupiter's C/O ratio should determine whether Jupiter accreted its metals from\ncarbon rich gas or oxygen rich solids. \n\n"}

We derive the dust-to-gas mass ratio\nprofile in the dust halo using the fact that partial dust condensation\nregulates the temperature to the dust evaporation temperature. Beyond the dust\nhalo, there is an optically thick condensation front where all the available\nsilicate gas condenses out. The curvature of the condensation surface is\ndetermined by the condition that the surface temperature must be nearly equal\nto the characteristic temperature $\\sim 1200{\\,\\rm K}$. We derive the mid-plane\ntemperature in the outer two regions using the two-layer approximation with the\nadditional heating by the condensation front for the outermost region. As a\nresult, the overall temperature profile is step-like with steep gradients at\nthe borders between the outer three regions. The borders might act as planet\ntraps where the inward migration of planets due to gravitational interaction\nwith the gas disk stops.

In this study,\nwe simulate populations of young stars to investigate whether this apparent\ndependence of estimated age on spectral type may be explained by the star\nformation history of the association. Solar and intermediate mass stars begin\ntheir pre-main sequence evolution on the Hayashi track, with fully convective\ninteriors and cool photospheres. Intermediate mass stars quickly heat up and\ntransition onto the radiative Henyey track. As a consequence, for clusters in\nwhich star formation occurs on a similar timescale as the transition from a\nconvective to a radiative interior, discrepancies in ages will arise when ages\nare calculated as a function of temperature instead of mass. Simple simulations\nof a cluster with constant star formation over several Myr may explain about\nhalf of the difference in inferred ages versus photospheric temperature;\nspeculative constructions that consist of a constant star formation followed by\na large supernova-driven burst could fully explain the differences, including\nthose between F and G stars where evolutionary tracks may be more accurate. The\nage spreads of low-mass stars predicted from these prescriptions for star\nformation are consistent with the observed luminosity spread of Upper Sco.

From the PMS to the RGB at solar\n  metallicity Abstract: Star-planet interactions must be taken into account in stellar models to\nunderstand the dynamical evolution of close-in planets. The dependence of the\ntidal interactions on the structural and rotational evolution of the star is of\npeculiar importance and should be correctly treated. We quantify how tidal\ndissipation in the convective envelope of rotating low-mass stars evolves from\nthe pre-main sequence up to the red-giant branch depending on the initial\nstellar mass. We investigate the consequences of this evolution on planetary\norbital evolution. We couple the tidal dissipation formalism described in\nMathis (2015) to the stellar evolution code STAREVOL and apply it to rotating\nstars with masses between 0.3 and 1.4 M$_\\odot$. In addition, we generalize the\nwork of Bolmont & Mathis (2016) by following the orbital evolution of close-in\nplanets using the new tidal dissipation predictions for advanced phases of\nstellar evolution. On the PMS the evolution of tidal dissipation is controlled\nby the evolution of the internal structure of the contracting star. On the MS\nit is strongly driven by the variation of surface rotation that is impacted by\nmagnetized stellar winds braking. The main effect of taking into account the\nrotational evolution of the stars is to lower the tidal dissipation strength by\nabout four orders of magnitude on the main-sequence, compared to a normalized\ndissipation rate that only takes into account structural changes. The evolution\nof the dissipation strongly depends on the evolution of the internal structure\nand rotation of the star. From the pre-main sequence up to the tip of the\nred-giant branch, it varies by several orders of magnitude, with strong\nconsequences for the orbital evolution of close-in massive planets. These\neffects are the strongest during the pre-main sequence, implying that the\nplanets are mainly sensitive to the star's early history. \n\n"}

Numerical investigations\nsuggest that turbulence eases the condition for explosion, but how is not fully\nunderstood. We develop a turbulence model for neutrino-driven convection, and\nshow that this turbulence model reduces the condition for explosions by about\n30%, in concordance with multi-dimensional simulations. In addition, we\nidentify which turbulent terms enable explosions. Contrary to prior\nsuggestions, turbulent ram pressure is not the dominant factor in reducing the\ncondition for explosion. Instead, there are many contributing factors, ram\npressure being only one of them, but the dominant factor is turbulent\ndissipation (TD). Primarily, TD provides extra heating, adding significant\nthermal pressure, and reducing the condition for explosion. The source of this\nTD power is turbulent kinetic energy, which ultimately derives its energy from\nthe higher potential of an unstable convective profile. Investigating a\nturbulence model in conjunction with an explosion condition enables insight\nthat is difficult to glean from merely analyzing complex multi-dimensional\nsimulations. An explosion condition presents a clear diagnostic to explain why\nstars explode, and the turbulence model allows us to explore how turbulence\nenables explosion.

The analysis of the observed features provides information on the\nproperties of the inner disk, the accretion columns, and the winds. Both\nsources display composite HI line profiles, with contributions from both\naccreting gas and high-velocity winds. These lines become more symmetric and\nnarrower with increasing upper energy, which may be interpreted in terms of two\ncomponents with different decrements or imputed to self-absorption effects. XZ\nTau shows a relatively high state of activity with respect to literature\nobservations. The variation of the HeI 1.08um line blue-shifted absorption\nsuggests that the inner wind has undergone a dramatic change in its velocity\nstructure, connected with a recent accretion event. DR Tau has a more stable\nwind as its HeI 1.08um absorption is stable in time in spite of strong\nvariability of the emission component. The IR veiling can be interpreted as due\nto blackbody emission at temperatures of 1600K for XZ Tau and 2300K DR Tau,\nwith emitting areas ~30 times larger than the star. For XZ Tau these conditions\nare consistent with emission from the inner rim of the dusty disk, while for DR\nTau the fairly high temperature may suggest an origin from a thick gaseous disk\nwithin the dust sublimation radius. Strong and broad metallic lines, mainly\nfrom CI and FeI, are detected in XZ Tau, similar to those observed in other\nEXor sources during burst phases.

In the future, this spectroscopic work will be combined with\nprecise photometric eclipses to draw an empirical mass/radius relation for the\nbottom of the mass sequence. This has applications in both stellar astrophysics\nand the growing number of exoplanet surveys around M-dwarfs. In particular, we\nhave discovered 34 systems with a secondary mass below $0.2 M_\\odot$, and so we\nwill ultimately double the known number of very low-mass stars with well\ncharacterised mass and radii.\n  We are able to detect eccentricities as small as 0.001 and orbital periods to\nsub-second precision.

Here we investigate,\nfirstly, whether there is a correlation between the size of starspots - assumed\nto be related to the amplitude of the sinusoid - and their decay timescale and,\nsecondly, whether any such correlation depends on the stellar effective\ntemperature. To determine this, we computed the autocorrelation functions of\nthe light curves of samples of stars from Kepler and fitted them with apodised\nperiodic functions. The light curve amplitudes, representing spot size were\nmeasured from the root-mean-squared scatter of the normalised light curves. We\nused a Monte Carlo Markov Chain to measure the periods and decay timescales of\nthe light curves. The results show a correlation between the decay time of\nstarspots and their inferred size.

We use a set of\nhydrodynamic simulations to determine the structure of discs forming in\ncollapsing molecular clouds. We examine how radiative feedback from the host\nprotostar affects the disc properties by examining three regimes: without\nradiative feedback, with continuous radiative feedback and with episodic\nfeedback, similar to FU Ori-type outbursts. We find that the radial surface\ndensity and temperature profiles vary significantly as the disc accretes gas\nfrom the infalling envelope. These profiles are sensitive to the presence of\nspiral structure, induced by gravitational instabilities, and the radiative\nfeedback provided by the protostar, especially in the case when the feedback is\nepisodic. We also investigate whether mass estimates from position-velocity\n(PV) diagrams are accurate for early-phase discs.

For simplicity, the ratio of azimuthal field to axial field is\nkept fixed.

We calculate the azimuthal\nand axial energy spectra corresponding to these two regimes and show that they\ndiffer qualitatively. Remarkably, the nonlinear state remains in all cases\nnearly axisymmetric suggesting that HMRI turbulence is quasi two-dimensional in\nnature.

Protostars do not evolve in\nisolation of their environment, but grow through accretion of gas. In addition,\nwhile an age can be defined for a star forming region, the ages of individual\nstars in the region will vary.

We use a global MHD\nsimulation including a sub-scale sink particle model of a star forming region\nto follow the accretion process of each star. The accretion profiles are used\nto compute stellar evolution models for each star, incorporating a model of how\nthe accretion energy is distributed to the disk, radiated away at the accretion\nshock, or incorporated into the outer layers of the protostar.

We estimate the magnetic energy available in the interaction using\nanalytical models to provide an upper bound to the expected flare energy. We\ninvestigate three different mechanisms leading to magnetic energy release. The\nfirst two can release an energy up to $(0.2-1.2) B^{2}_{0} R^{3}/\\mu$, where\n$B_{0}$ is the surface field of the star, $R$ its radius, and $\\mu$ the\nmagnetic permeability of the plasma. They operate in young active stars whose\ncoronae have closed magnetic field lines up to the distance of their close-by\nplanets that can trigger the energy release. The third mechanism operates in\nweakly or moderately active stars having a coronal field with predominantly\nopen field lines at the distance of their planets.

Although only a few\nsystems have been observed with both the radial velocity and direct imaging\ntechniques, this number will increase thanks to upcoming spacecraft and ground\nbased surveys. Providing both forms of data enables simultaneous fitting that\ncan help break degeneracies in the orbital elements that arise when only one\ndata type is available. The dynamical mass estimates this approach can produce\nare important when investigating the formation mechanisms and subsequent\nevolution of substellar companions. ExoSOFT was verified through fitting to\nartificial data and was implemented using the Python and Cython programming\nlanguages; available for public download at https://github.com/kylemede/ExoSOFT\nunder the GNU General Public License v3. \n\n"}

In the last hours of the interaction the neutron\nstar merges with the core, accretes mass, and launches jets that eject the core\nand the inner envelope to form the explosion itself and the medium where the\nsupernova photosphere resides.

In our previous paper, we showed that the\nmass outflow rate depends strongly on the mass accretion rate onto the\ncircumstellar disk around a high-mass protostar, and massive outflows may be\ndriven by the magnetic effect in high-mass star-forming cores. In the present\nstudy, in order to verify that the MHD disk wind is the primary driving\nmechanism of massive outflows, we quantitatively compare outflow properties\nobtained through simulations and observations. Since the outflows obtained\nthrough simulations are slightly younger than those obtained through\nobservations, the time-integrated quantities of outflow mass, momentum, and\nkinetic energy are slightly smaller than those obtained through observations.\nOn the other hand, time-derivative quantities of mass ejection rate, outflow\nmomentum flux, and kinetic luminosity obtained through simulations are in very\ngood agreement with those obtained through observations. This indicates that\nthe MHD disk wind greatly contributes to the massive outflow driving from\nhigh-mass protostars, and the magnetic field might significantly control the\nhigh-mass star formation process. \n\n"}

Abstract: Out of the $\\sim$ 3000 exoplanets detected so far, only fourteen planets are\nmembers of open clusters: among them an exoplanet system around Pr 0211 in the\ncluster M44 which consists of at least two planets with the outer planet moving\non a highly eccentric orbit at 5.5 AU. One hypothesis is that a close fly-by of\na neighbouring star was responsible for the eccentric orbit. We test this\nhypothesis. First we determine the type of fly-by that would lead to the\nobserved parameters and then use this result to determine the history of such\nfly-bys in simulations of the early dynamics in an M44-like environment. We\nfind that although very close fly-bys are required to obtain the observed\nproperties of Pr 0211c, such fly-bys are relatively common due to the high\nstellar density and longevity of the cluster. Such close fly-bys are most\nfrequent during the first 1-2 Myr after cluster formation, corresponding to a\ncluster age $\\leq$ 3 Myr. During the first 2 to 3 Myr about 6.5% of stars\nactually experience a fly-by that would lead to such a small system-size as\nobserved for Pr0211 or even smaller. It is unclear whether planets generally\nform on such short timescales. However, afterwards the close fly-by rate is\nstill 0.2-0.5 Myr$^{-1}$, which means extrapolating this to the age of M44\n12%-20% of stars would experience such close fly-bys over this timespan. Our\nsimulations show that the fly-by scenario is a realistic option for the\nformation of eccentricity orbits of the planets in M44. The occurrence of such\nevents is relatively high leading to the expectation that similar systems are\nlikely common in open clusters in general. \n\n"}

Rotation critically influences\nthe mass of the exploding cores, the mass and chemical composition of the\nenvelopes and the types of supernovae, as well as the properties of the\nremnants and the chemical yields. In the formation of gamma-ray bursts,\nrotation and the properties of rotating stars appear as the key factor. In\nbinaries, the interaction between axial rotation and tidal effects often leads\nto interesting and unexpected results. Rotation plays a key role in shaping the\nevolution and nucleosynthesis in massive stars with very low metallicities\n(metallicity below about the Small Magellanic Cloud metallicity down to\nPopulation III stars). At solar and higher metallicities, the effects of\nrotation compete with those of stellar winds. In close binaries, the\nsynchronisation process can lock the star at a high rotation rate despite\nstrong mass loss and thus both effects, rotation and stellar winds, have a\nstrong impact. In conclusion, rotation is a key physical ingredient of the\nstellar models and of presupernova stages, and the evolution both of single\nstars and close binaries.

At such close distances, the planet orbits within\nthe sub-alfvenic radius of the star in which the transfer of energy and angular\nmomentum between the two bodies is particularly efficient. The magnetic\ninteractions appear as enhanced stellar activity modulated by the planet as it\norbits the star rather than only by stellar rotation. Such observations allowed\nfor the determination of the magnetic field strengths on the surfaces of four\nhot Jupiters.

In our\nsearch for stochastic variability in 1643 bright peaks, only the previously\nidentified source, EC53, shows behavior well above the expected measurement\nuncertainty. Another four sources, two disks and two protostars, show\nmoderately-enhanced standard deviations in brightness, as expected for\nstochastic variables. For the two protostars, this apparent variability is the\nresult of single epochs that are much brighter than the mean. In our search for\nsecular brightness variations that are linear in time, we measure the\nfractional brightness change per year for 150 bright peaks, fifty of which are\nprotostellar. The ensemble distribution of slopes is well fit by a normal\ndistribution with sigma ~ 0.023. Most sources are not rapidly brightening or\nfading in the sub-mm.

Abstract: In the Hall magnetohydrodynamics, the onset condition of the Kelvin Helmholtz\ninstability is solely determined by the Hall effect and is independent of the\nnature of shear flows. In addition, the physical mechanism behind the super and\nsub Alfvenic flows becoming unstable is quite different: the high frequency\nright circularly polarized whistler becomes unstable in the super Alfvenic\nflows whereas low frequency, left circularly polarized ion-cyclotron wave\nbecomes unstable in the presence of sub Alfvenic shear flows. The growth rate\nof the Kelvin Helmholtz instability in the super Alfvenic case is higher than\nthe corresponding ideal magnetohydrodynamic rate. In the sub Alfvenic case, the\nHall effect opens up a new, hitherto inaccessible (to the magnetohydrodynamics)\nchannel through which the partially or fully ionized fluid can become\nKelvin-Helmholtz unstable. The instability growth rate in this case is smaller\nthan the super Alfvenic case owing to the smaller free shear energy content of\nthe flow. When the Hall term is somewhat smaller than the advection term in the\ninduction equation, the Hall effect is also responsible for the appearance of a\nnew overstable mode whose growth rate is smaller than the purely growing Kelvin\nHelmholtz mode. On the other hand, when the Hall diffusion dominates the\nadvection term, the growth rate of the instability depends only on the Alfven\nMach number and is independent of the Hall diffusion coefficient. Further, the\ngrowth rate in this case linearly increase with the Alfven frequency with\nsmaller slope for sub Alfvenic flows. \n\n"}

Understanding properties of stellar\nmagnetic fields in these stars finds a broad application in astrophysics,\nincluding, e.g., theory of stellar dynamos and environment conditions around\nplanets that may be orbiting these stars. Most stars with convective envelopes\nfollow a rotation-activity relationship where various activity indicators\nsaturate in stars with rotation periods shorter than a few days.

In this paper, we study\nthe rotational dynamics of interstellar asteroids (ISAs) of irregular shapes\nmoving through the interstellar gas. We find that regular mechanical torques\nresulting from the bombardment of gas flow on the irregular body could be\nimportant for the dynamics and destruction of ISAs. Mechanical torques can spin\nup the ISA, resulting in the breakup of the original ISA into small binary\nasteroids when the rotation rate exceeds the critical frequency. We find that\nthe breakup timescale is short for ISAs of highly irregular shapes and low\ntensile strength. We apply our results to the first observed ISA, `Oumuamua,\nand suggest that its extreme elongated shape may originate from a reassembly of\nthe binary fragments due to gravity along its journey in the interstellar\nmedium. The tumbling of `Oumuamua could have been induced by rotational\ndisruption due to mechanical torques.

Using method of Dolei et al.(2014), It is\nestimated that the density in each bright finger is greater than corresponding\ndark region lying below of it in the surrounding intermediate corona. The\ninstability is evolved due to wave perturbations that are parallel to the\nmagnetic field at the density interface. We conjecture that the prominence\nplasma is supported by tension component of the magnetic field against gravity.\nUsing linear stability theory, magnetic field is estimated as 21-40 mG to\nsuppress growth of MRT in the observed finger structures.

The spectrally and spatially resolved maps reveal the\nkinematics of the circumbinary disk as well as its chemistry. Molecular\nabundances are estimated using RADEX. The continuum emission reveals the\npresence of a circumbinary disk around the two sources. This disk has a\ndiameter of ~620 AU and is well traced by C17O and H13CO+ emission. C2H and\nc-C3H2 trace a higher-density region which is spatially offset from the sources\n(~430 AU). Finally, SO2 shows compact emission around one of the sources,\nOph-IRS67 B. The molecular transitions which trace the circumbinary disk are\nconsistent with a Keplerian profile on disk scales (< 200 AU) and an infalling\nprofile for envelope scales (> 200 AU). The Keplerian fit leads to a mass of\n2.2 Msun. Inferred CO abundances w.r.t. H2 are comparable to the canonical ISM\nvalue of 2.7e-4.

Around the chemical transition from atomic nitrogen to N2,\nN15N is selectively photodissociated, which results in the enrichment of 15N in\natomic nitrogen. As 15N-enriched atomic nitrogen is converted to ammonia ice\nvia grain surface reactions, the bulk gas is depleted in 15N. The level of 15N\ndepletion in the bulk gas can be up to a factor of two compared to the\nelemental nitrogen isotope ratio, depending on the photodesorption yield of\nammonia ice. Once the nitrogen isotopes are differentially partitioned between\ngas and solids in a molecular cloud, it should remain in the later stages of\nstar formation (e.g., prestellar core) as long as the sublimation of ammonia\nice is inefficient.

One of the observable\ntests for migration theories is the current value of the angle between the\nstellar equatorial plane and the orbital plane, called the obliquity. After the\nmain migration mechanism has ended, the obliquity and the semi-major axis keep\non evolving due to the combined effects of tides and magnetic braking. The\nobserved correlation between effective temperature and measured projected\nobliquity in known short-period systems has been taken as evidence of such\nmechanisms being at play. Our aim is to produce an improved model for the tidal\nevolution of the obliquity, including all the components of the dynamical tide\nfor circular misaligned systems. This model takes into account the strong\nvariations in structure and rotation of stars during their evolution, and their\nconsequences for the efficiency of tidal dissipation. We use an analytical\nformulation for the frequency-averaged dissipation in convective layers for\neach mode, depending only on global stellar parameters and rotation. For\ntypical hot-Jupiters orbital configurations, the obliquity is generally damped\non a much shorter timescale than the semi-major axis. The final outcome of\ntidal evolution is also very sensitive to the initial conditions, with\nJupiter-mass planets being either quickly destroyed or brought on more distant\norbit, depending on the initial ratio of planetary orbital momentum to stellar\nspin momentum. However we find that everything else being the same, the\nevolution of the obliquity around low-mass stars with a thin convective zone is\nnot slower than around those with a thicker convective zone. On the contrary,\nwe find that more massive stars, remaining faster rotator throughout their\nmain-sequence, produce more efficient dissipation. \n\n"}

Microwave observations\nfor specific regions with well-constrained PAH features would be crucial to\ntest the spinning dust hypothesis. In this paper, we present physical modeling\nof microwave emission from spinning PAHs from protoplanetary disks (PPDs)\naround Herbig Ae/Be stars and T-Tauri stars where PAH features are well\nobserved. Guided by the presence of 10 $\\mu$m silicate features in some PPDs,\nwe also model microwave emission from spinning nanosilicates. Thermal emission\nfrom big dust grains is computed using the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code.\nOur numerical results demonstrate that microwave emission from either spinning\nPAHs or spinning nanosilicates dominates over thermal dust at frequencies $\\nu<\n60$ GHz, even in the presence of significant grain growth. Finally, we attempt\nto fit mm-cm observational data with both thermal dust and spinning dust for\nseveral disks around Herbig Ae/Be stars that exhibit PAH features and find that\nspinning dust can successfully reproduce the observed excess microwave emission\n(EME).

Questioning the\n  active branch of stellar activity cycles Abstract: Chromospheric activity monitoring of a wide range of cool stars can provide\nvaluable information on stellar magnetic activity and its dependence on\nfundamental stellar parameters such as effective temperature and rotation.We\ncompile a chromospheric activity catalogue of 4454 cool stars from a\ncombination of archival HARPS spectra and multiple other surveys, including the\nMount Wilson data that have recently been released by the NSO. We explore the\nvariation in chromospheric activity of cool stars along the main sequence for\nstars with different effective temperatures.

The\nchromospheric activity index, S-index, was measured for 304 main-sequence stars\nfrom archived high-resolution HARPS spectra. Additionally, the measured and\narchived S-indices were converted into the chromospheric flux ratio log R'HK.\nThe activity-cycle periods were determined using the generalised Lomb-Scargle\nperiodogram to study the active and inactive branches on the\nrotation-activity-cycle period plane. The global sample shows that the\nbimodality of chromospheric activity, known as the Vaughan-Preston gap, is not\nprominent, with a significant percentage of the stars at an\nintermediate-activity level around log R'HK = -4.75. Independently, the cycle\nperiod search shows that stars can lie in the region intermediate between the\nactive and inactive branch, which means that the active branch is not as\nclearly distinct as previously thought. The weakening of the Vaughan-Preston\ngap indicates that cool stars spin down from a higher activity level and settle\nat a lower activity level without a sudden break at intermediate activity. Some\ncycle periods are close to the solar value between the active and inactive\nbranch, which suggests that the solar dynamo is most likely a common case of\nthe stellar dynamo. \n\n"}

In this paper, we investigate the\nhypothesis that only certain mass accretion rates result in detectable bandhead\nemission in the near infrared spectra of MYSOs. Using an analytic disc model\ncombined with an LTE model of the CO emission, we find that high accretion\nrates ($\\gtrsim 10^{-4}\\,{\\rm M}_{\\odot}{\\mathrm{yr}}^{-1}$) result in large\ndust sublimation radii, a larger contribution to the $K$-band continuum from\nhot dust at the dust sublimation radius, and therefore correspondingly lower CO\nemission with respect to the continuum. On the other hand, low accretion rates\n($\\lesssim10^{-6}\\,{\\rm M}_{\\odot}{\\mathrm{yr}}^{-1}$) result in smaller dust\nsublimation radii, a correspondingly smaller emitting area of CO, and thus also\nlower CO emission with respect to the continuum. In general, moderate accretion\nrates produce the most prominent, and therefore detectable, CO first overtone\nemission. We compare our findings to a recent near-infrared spectroscopic\nsurvey of MYSOs, finding results consistent with our hypothesis. We conclude\nthat the detection rate of CO bandhead emission in the spectra of MYSOs could\nbe the result of MYSOs exhibiting a range of mass accretion rates, perhaps due\nto the variable accretion suggested by recent multi-epoch observations of these\nobjects. \n\n"}

These can be seen as a splitting or spread in the\nsub-giant and red giant branches (SGB and RGB) when certain photometric filter\ncombinations are used. Due to its relative youth, NGC 1978 can be used to place\nstringent limits on whether multiple bursts of star-formation have taken place\nwithin the cluster, as predicted by some models for the origin of multiple\npopulations. We carry out two distinct analyses to test whether multiple\nstar-formation epochs have occurred within NGC 1978. First, we use UV CMDs to\nselect stars from the first and second population along the SGB, and then\ncompare their positions in optical CMDs, where the morphology is dominantly\ncontrolled by age as opposed to multiple population effects. We find that the\ntwo populations are indistinguishable, with age differences of $1\\pm20$ Myr\nbetween them.

Previously, we measured stellar radii to 11%\nprecision using high-resolution spectroscopy; by adding Gaia astrometry, the\nerrors are now 2%.

With a catalog of ~1000 planets with precise properties, we probed\nin fine detail the gap in the planet size distribution that separates two\nclasses of small planets, rocky super-Earths and gas-dominated sub-Neptunes.\nOur previous study and others suggested that the gap may be observationally\nunder-resolved and inherently flat-bottomed, with a band of forbidden planet\nsizes.

Two other important factors that sculpt the distribution are a\nplanet's orbital distance and its host star mass, both of which are related to\na planet's X-ray/UV irradiation history. For lower mass stars, the bimodal\nplanet distribution shifts to smaller sizes, consistent with smaller stars\nproducing smaller planet cores.

We aim to\nconstrain radial differential rotation profiles in gamma Doradus (gamma Dor)\nstars, and to develop new theoretical seismic diagnosis for such stars with\nrapid and potentially non-uniform rotation. Methods. We derive a new asymptotic\ndescription which accounts for the impact of weak differential near-core\nrotation on gravity- mode period spacings. The theoretical predictions are\nillustrated from pulsation computations with the code GYRE and compared with\nobservations of gamma Dor stars. When possible, we also derive the surface\nrotation rates in these stars by detecting and analysing signatures of\nrotational modulation, and compute the core-to-surface rotation ratios.\nResults. Stellar rotation has to be strongly differential before its effects on\nperiod spacing patterns can be detected, unless multiple period spacing\npatterns can be compared. Six stars in our sample exhibit a single unexplained\nperiod spacing pattern of retrograde modes. We hypothesise that these are Yanai\nmodes.

If only one period spacing\npattern is detected and analysed for a star, it is difficult to detect\ndifferential rotation. A rigidly rotating model will often provide the best\nsolution. Differential rotation can only be detected when multiple period\nspacing patterns have been found for a single star or its surface rotation rate\nis known as well.

Several sulfur-bearing molecules are observed in the interstellar\nmedium and in comets, in strong contrast to protoplanetary disks where only CS,\nH$_2$CS and SO have been detected so far. Aims. We combine observations and\nchemical models to constrain the sulfur abundances and their sensitivity to\nphysical and chemical conditions in the DM Tau protoplanetary disk. Methods. We\nobtained $0.5^{\"}$ ALMA observations of DM Tau in Bands 4 and 6 in lines of CS,\nSO, SO$_2$, OCS, CCS, H$_2$CS and H$_2$S, achieving a $\\sim 5$ mJy sensitivity.\nUsing the non-LTE radiative transfer code RADEX and the forward-modeling tool\nDiskFit, disk-averaged CS column densities and upper limits for the other\nspecies were derived. Results. Only CS was detected with a derived column\ndensity of $\\sim 2-6 \\times 10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$. We report a first tentative\ndetection of SO$_2$ in DM Tau. The upper limits range between $\\sim 10^{11}$\nand $10^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$ for the other S-bearing species. The best-fit chemical\nmodel matching these values requires a gas-phase C/O ratio of > 1 at $r \\sim\n50-100$ au. With chemical modeling we demonstrate that sulfur-bearing species\ncould be robust tracers of the gas-phase C/O ratio, surface reaction rates,\ngrain size and UV intensities. Conclusions. The lack of detections of a variety\nof sulfur-bearing molecules in DM Tau other than CS implies a dearth of\nreactive sulfur in the gas phase, either through efficient freeze-out or\nbecause most of the elemental sulfur is in other large species, as found in\ncomets. The inferred high CS/SO and CS/SO$_2$ ratios require a non-solar C/O\ngas-phase ratio of > 1, consistent with the recent observations of hydrocarbon\nrings in DM Tau. The stronger depletion of oxygen-bearing S-species compared to\nCS is likely linked to the low observed abundances of gaseous water in DM Tau\nand points to a removal mechanism of oxygen from the gas. \n\n"}

Such obliquities may reveal clues about hot Jupiter\ndynamical histories. Common explanations for generating obliquities include\nhigh-eccentricity migration and primordial disk misalignment. This paper\ninvestigates another mechanism for producing stellar spin-orbit misalignments\nin systems hosting a close-in planet with an external, modestly inclined\ncompanion. Spin-orbit misalignment may be excited due to a secular resonance,\noccurring when the precession rate of the stellar spin axis (driven by the\ninner planet) becomes comparable to the nodal precession rate of the inner\nplanet (driven by the companion). Due to the spin-down of the host star via\nmagnetic braking, this resonance may be achieved during the star's\nmain-sequence lifetime for a wide range of planet masses and orbital\narchitectures. Obliquity excitation is accompanied by a decrease in mutual\ninclination between the inner planet and perturber, and can thus erase high\ninclinations. For hot Jupiters, the stellar spin axis is strongly coupled to\nthe orbital axis, and obliquity excitation by a giant planet companion requires\na strong perturber, usually located within 1-2 AU. For warm Jupiters, the spin\nand orbital axes are more weakly coupled, and the resonance may be achieved for\ndistant giant planet perturbers (at several to tens of AU). Since warm Jupiters\nhave a high occurrence rate of distant planetary companions with appropriate\nproperties for resonant obliquity excitation, stellar obliquities in warm\nJupiter systems may be common, particularly for warm Jupiters orbiting cool\nstars that have undergone significant spin-down. \n\n"}

Assuming that the disc's accretion onto\nthe star is the main process that clears the disc, the atmosphere of the star\nwill show abundance reductions caused by the material accreted by the forming\nplanet(s). If planets are only forming around one star of a binary system, the\nplanet formation process can result in abundance differences in wide binary\nstars, if their natal protoplanetary discs do not interact during planet\nformation. Abundance differences in the atmospheres of wide binaries hosting\ngiant planets have already been observed and linked to the formation location\nof giant planets. Here, we model how much building material is taken away for\nsuper-Earth planets that form inside/outside of the water ice line as well as\nice giants forming inside/outside of the CO ice line. Our model predicts a\nsignificant abundance difference $\\Delta$[X/H] in the stellar atmospheres of\nthe planet-hosting binary component. Our model predicts that super-Earths that\nform inside the water ice line ($r<r_{\\rm H_2O}$) will result in an\n$\\Delta$[Fe/H]/$\\Delta$[O/H] abundance difference in the their host star that\nis a factor of 2 larger than for super-Earths formed outside the water ice line\n($r>r_{\\rm H_2O}$) in the water rich parts of the disc.

Here, we present the chemical\nmodeling of glycine in hot cores using the state-of-the-art three-phase\nchemical model NAUTILUS, which is focused on the latest glycine chemistry. For\nthe formation process of glycine on the grain surface, we obtained consistent\nresults with previous studies that glycine would be formed via the reactions of\nCOOH with CH$_2$NH$_2$. However, we will report three important findings\nregarding the chemical evolution and the detectability of interstellar glycine.\nFirst, with the experimentally obtained binding energy from the temperature\nprogrammed thermal desorption (TPD) experiment, a large proportion of glycine\nwas destroyed through the grain surface reactions with NH or CH$_3$O radicals\nbefore it fully evaporates. As a result, the formation process in the gas phase\nis more important than thermal evaporation from grains. If this is the case,\nNH$_2$OH and CH$_3$COOH rather than CH$_3$NH$_2$ and CH$_2$NH would be the\nessential precursors to the gas phase glycine. Secondly, since the gas phase\nglycine will be quickly destroyed by positive ions or radicals, early\nevolutionary phase of the hot cores would be the preferable target for the\nfuture glycine surveys. Thirdly, we suggest the possibility that the\nsuprathermal hydrogen atoms can strongly accelerate the formation of COOH\nradicals from CO$_2$, resulting in the dramatic increase of formation rate of\nglycine on grains. The efficiency of this process should be investigated in\ndetail by theoretical and experimental studies in the future. \n\n"}

Using functions\ncalled sensitivity kernels, we may image the underlying anomalies that cause\nmeasured shifts in travel times. The inference of large-scale structures e.g\nmeridional circulation requires computing sensitivity kernels in spherical\ngeometry. Mandal et al.

Second, unlike the planets themselves, the\nTNOs do not orbit on coplanar, circular orbits around the Sun, but move mostly\non inclined, eccentric orbits and are distributed in a complex way. This\nimplies that some process restructured the outer solar system after its\nformation. However, some of TNOs, referred to as Sednoids, move outside the\nzone of influence of the planets. Thus external forces must have played an\nimportant part in the restructuring of the outer solar system. The study\npresented here shows that a close fly-by of a neighbouring star can\nsimultaneously lead to the observed lower mass density outside 30 AU and excite\nthe TNOs onto eccentric, inclined orbits, including the family of Sednoids. In\nthe past it was estimated that such close fly-bys are rare during the relevant\ndevelopment stage. However, our numerical simulations show that such a scenario\nis much more likely than previously anticipated.

Because of this, it has been difficult to draw any definite conclusions\nby just using kinetic simulations. Particle acceleration model that solves\nenergetic particle transport equation can capture the main acceleration physics\nfound in kinetic simulations, and thus provide a practical way to make\nobservable predictions and directly compare model results with observations.\nHere we study compression particle acceleration in magnetic reconnection by\nsolving Parker (diffusion-advection) transport equation using velocity and\nmagnetic fields from two-dimensional high-Lundquist-number magnetohydrodynamics\n(MHD) simulations of a low-$\\beta$ reconnection layer.

One and only mechanism proposed for prolonging the residence time of\nhot grains in the near-stellar environments is trapping of charged\nnanoparticles by stellar magnetic fields. We revisit the model of magnetic\ngrain trapping around main-sequence stars of various spectral classes by taking\ninto account sublimation and electric charging of the grains. The model of\nmagnetic grain trapping predicts that hot dust grains are present in the\nvicinity of main-sequence stars with high rotation velocities and intermediate\nmagnetic-field strengths.

The complex organic molecules can be divided into two\ngroups with one group, the simpler species, showing a D/H ratio of\napproximately 2% and the other, the more complex species, D/H ratios of 4-8%.\nThis division may reflect the formation time of each species in the ices before\nor during warm-up/infall of material through the protostellar envelope. No\nsignificant differences are seen in the deuteration of different functional\ngroups for individual species, possibly a result of the short time-scale for\ninfall through the innermost warm regions where exchange reactions between\ndifferent species may be taking place.

Despite many efforts in trying to mitigate the effect of\nstellar activity using empirical and statistical techniques, it seems that we\nare facing an obstacle that will be extremely difficult to overcome using\ncurrent techniques. In this paper, we investigate a novel approach to derive\nprecise RVs considering the wealth of information present in high-resolution\nspectra. This new method consists in building a master spectrum from all\nobservations and measure the RVs of each spectral line in a spectrum relative\nto it. When analysing several spectra, the final product is the RVs of each\nline as a function of time. We demonstrate on three stars intensively observed\nwith HARPS that our new method gives RVs that are extremely similar to the ones\nderived from the HARPS data reduction software. Our new approach to derive RVs\ndemonstrates that the non-stability of daily HARPS wavelength solution induces\nnight-to-night RV offsets with an standard deviation of 0.4 m/s, and we propose\na solution to correct for this systematic. Finally, and this is probably the\nmost astrophysically relevant result of this paper, we demonstrate that some\nspectral lines are strongly affected by stellar activity while others are not.\nBy measuring the RVs on two carefully selected subsample of spectral lines, we\ndemonstrate that we can boost by a factor of 2 or mitigate by a factor of 1.6\nthe red noise induced by stellar activity in the 2010 RVs of Alpha Cen B.

Recent analysis of numerical\nexperiments simulating the generation of solar eruptions have shown that the\nratio of the non-potential helicity to the total relative helicity is a clear\nmarker of the eruptivity of the magnetic system, and that the high value of\nthat quantity could be a sufficient condition for the onset of the instability\ngenerating the eruptions. The present study introduces the first analytical\nexamination of the time variations of these non-potential and volume-threading\nhelicities. The validity of the analytical formulas derived are confirmed with\nanalysis of three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations of\nsolar coronal dynamics.

The artificially high (numerical and uncontrolled) magnetic\ndiffusivity leads to a large magnetic flux pervading the star forming region.\nWe argue further that in reality the dynamics of high magnetic Prandtl number\nturbulence may lead to local regions of magnetic energy dissipation through\nreconnection, meaning that the regions of molecular clouds which are forming\nstars might be essentially free of magnetic fields. Thus the simulations that\nignore magnetic fields on the scales on which the properties of stellar masses,\nstellar multiplicities and planet-forming discs are determined, may be closer\nto reality than those which include magnetic fields, but can only do so in an\nunrealistic parameter regime. \n\n"}

The protoplanetary disk at that time was already truncated around the\nKuiper-cliff (at $45$ au) by encounters with another cluster members before it\nwas enriched by the wind of the nearby Wolf-Rayet star. The supernova explosion\nof a nearby star, possibly but not necessarily the exploding Wolf-Rayet star,\nheated the disk to $\\apgt 1500$K, melting small dust grains and causing the\nencapsulation and preservation of $^{26}$Al into vitreous droplets. This\nsupernova, and possibly several others, caused a further abrasion of the disk\nand led to its observed tilt of $5.6\\pm1.2^\\circ$ with respect to the Sun's\nequatorial plane. The abundance of $^{60}$Fe originates from a supernova shell,\nbut its preservation results from a subsequent supernova. At least two\nsupernovae are needed (one to deliver $^{60}$Fe\\, and one to preserve it in the\ndisk) to explain the observed characteristics of the Solar system. The most\nprobable birth cluster then has $N = 2500\\pm300$ stars and a radius of $r_{\\rm\nvir} = 0.75\\pm0.25$ pc. We conclude that Solar systems equivalent systems form\nin the Milky Way Galaxy at a rate of about 30 per Myr, in which case\napproximately 36,000 Solar system analogues roam the Milky Way. \n\n"}

They are, however, promising candidates for\nthe progenitors of the heaviest binary black hole (BBH) mergers detected. If\nthese BBHs are the product of binary evolution, then PPISNe could occur in very\nclose binaries. Motivated by this, we discuss the implications of a PPISN\nhappening with a close binary companion, and what impact these events have on\nthe formation of merging BBHs through binary evolution. For this, we have\ncomputed a set of models of metal-poor ($Z_\\odot/10$) single helium stars using\nthe \\texttt{MESA} software instrument. For PPISN progenitors with pre-pulse\nmasses $>50M_\\odot$ we find that, after a pulse, heat deposited throughout the\nlayers of the star that remain bound cause it to expand to more than\n$100R_\\odot$ for periods of $10^2-10^4\\;$~yrs depending on the mass of the\nprogenitor. This results in long-lived phases of Roche-lobe overflow or even\ncommon-envelope events if there is a close binary companion, leading to\nadditional electromagnetic transients associated to PPISN eruptions.

The BRITE-Heweliusz satellite was used to collect\nphotometric data of HD149404. Additional photometry was retrieved from the SMEI\narchive. These data were analysed using a suite of period search tools. The\norbital part of the lightcurve was modelled with the nightfall binary star\ncode. The Gaia-DR2 parallax of HD149404 was used to provide additional\nconstraints. The periodograms reveal a clear orbital modulation of the\nlightcurve with a peak-to-peak amplitude near 0.04 mag. The remaining\nnon-orbital part of the variability is consistent with red noise. The\nlightcurve folded with the orbital period reveals ellipsoidal variations, but\nno eclipses. The minimum when the secondary star is in inferior conjunction is\ndeeper than the other minimum due to mutual reflection effects between the\nstars. Combined with the Gaia-DR2 parallaxes, the photometric data indicate an\norbital inclination in the range of 23{\\deg} to 31{\\deg} and a Roche lobe\nfilling factor of the secondary larger than or equal to 0.96. The luminosity of\nthe primary star is consistent with its present-day mass, whereas the more\nevolved secondary appears overluminous for its mass.

This might account for some of the\nchaotic departures from axisymmetric structures in some planetary nebulae.

Achieving an accurate model of\ninterstellar dust is therefore of great importance. Interstellar dust models\nare usually built based on observational constraints such as starlight\nextinction and polarization, but dynamical constraints such as grain rotation\nare not considered. In this paper, we show that a newly discovered effect by\nHoang et al., so-called RAdiative Torque Disruption (RATD), can act as an\nimportant dynamical constraint for dust models. Using this dynamical\nconstraint, we derive the maximum size of grains that survive in the ISM for\ndifferent dust models, including contact binary, composite, silicate-core, and\namorphous carbon mantle, and compact grain model for the different radiation\nfields. We find that the different dust models have different maximum size due\nto their different tensile strengths, and the largest maximum size corresponds\nto compact grains with the highest tensile strength. We show that the composite\ngrain model cannot be ruled out if constituent particles are very small with\nradius $a_{p}\\le$ 25 nm, but large composite grains would be destroyed if the\nparticles are large with $a_{p}\\ge 50$ nm.

Methods: We use simulations of forced turbulence in\nfully periodic cubes composed of isothermal gas with an imposed large-scale\nsinusoidal shear flow.

The\nscale dependence of the coefficients is studied by varying the wavenumber of\nthe imposed sinusoidal shear and test fields. Results: We find that turbulent\nviscosity and magnetic diffusivity are in general of the same order of\nmagnitude.

Our aim is to search for direct\nevidence for the presence of hot gas inside of the expected dust sublimation\nradius of MWC147. By combining VLTI/AMBER spectro-interferometry (R=12,000)\nwith CRIRES spectroscopy (R=100,000) we can both spectrally and spatially\nresolve the Br-gamma line-emitting gas around MWC147. Our interferometric\nvisibility modelling of MWC147 indicates the presence of a compact continuum\ndisk with a close to face-on orientation. We model the continuum with an\ninclined Gaussian, as well as a ring with a radius of 0.60mas (0.39au) which is\nwell within the expected dust sublimation radius of 1.52au. We detect no\nsignificant change in the measured visibilities across the Br-gamma line,\nindicating that the line-emitting gas is located in the same region as the\ncontinuum-emitting disk. We fit our AMBER spectro-interferometry data with a\nkinematic model of a disk in Keplerian rotation, with both the line-emitting\nand continuum-emitting components of the disk originating from the same compact\nregion close to the central star. The presence of line-emitting gas in the same\nregion as the K-band continuum supports the interpretation that the K-band\ncontinuum traces an optically-thick gas disk. Our spatially and spectrally\nresolved observations of MWC147 reveal that the K-band continuum and Br-gamma\nemission both originate from a similar compact region, with Br-gamma emitted\nfrom the accretion disk or disk wind region and exhibiting a rotational\nvelocity profile. We conclude that we detect the presence of a compact, gaseous\naccretion disk in Keplerian rotation around MWC147. \n\n"}

This provides\nthe first step towards the production of pebbles and planetesimals in\nprotoplanetary disks. Currently, it is well established that Class II objects\nhave large dust grains. However, it is not clear when in the star formation\nprocess this grain growth occurs. We use multi-wavelength millimeter\nobservations of a Class I protostar to obtain the spectral index of the\nobserved flux densities $\\alpha_\\mathrm{mm}$ of the unresolved disk and the\nsurrounding envelope. Our goal is to compare our observational results with\nvisibility modeling at both wavelengths simultaneously. We present data from\nNOEMA at 2.7 mm and SMA at 1.3 mm of the Class I protostar, Per-emb-50. We\nmodel the dust emission with a variety of parametric and radiative transfer\nmodels to deduce the grain size from the observed emission spectral index. We\nfind a spectral index in the envelope of Per-emb-50 of $\\alpha_{\\rm\nenv}$=$3.3\\pm0.3$, similar to the typical ISM values. The radiative transfer\nmodeling of the source confirms this value of $\\alpha_{\\rm env}$ with the\npresence of dust with a $a_\\mathrm{max}$$\\leq$100 $\\mu$m. Additionally, we\nexplore the backwarming effect, where we find that the envelope structure\naffects the millimeter emission of the disk. Our results reveal grains with a\nmaximum size no larger than $100$ $\\mu$m in the inner envelope of the Class I\nprotostar Per-emb-50, providing an interesting case to test the universality of\nmillimeter grain growth expected in these sources. \n\n"}

The Stellar Multiplicity Rate of M Dwarfs\n  Within 25 pc Abstract: We present results of the largest, most comprehensive study ever done of the\nstellar multiplicity of the most common stars in the Galaxy, the red dwarfs. We\nhave conducted an all-sky, volume-limited survey for stellar companions to 1120\nM dwarf primaries known to lie within 25 pc of the Sun via trigonometric\nparallaxes. In addition to a comprehensive literature search, stars were\nexplored in new surveys for companions at separations of 2\" to 300\". A\nreconnaissance of wide companions to separations of 300\" was done via blinking\narchival images. I-band images were used to search our sample for companions at\nseparations of 2\" to 180\". Various astrometric and photometric methods were\nused to probe the inner 2\" to reveal close companions. We report the discovery\nof 20 new companions and identify 56 candidate multiple systems.\n  We find a stellar multiplicity rate of 26.8 +/- 1.4% and a stellar companion\nrate of 32.4 +/- 1.4% for M dwarfs. There is a broad peak in the separation\ndistribution of the companions at 4 -- 20 AU, with a weak trend of smaller\nprojected linear separations for lower mass primaries. A hint that M dwarf\nmultiplicity may be a function of tangential velocity is found, with faster\nmoving, presumably older, stars found to be multiple somewhat less often. We\ncalculate that stellar companions make up at least 17% of mass attributed to M\ndwarfs in the solar neighborhood, with roughly 11% of M dwarf mass hidden as\nunresolved companions. Finally, when considering all M dwarf primaries and\ncompanions, we find that the mass distribution for M dwarfs increases to the\nend of the stellar main sequence. \n\n"}

These are the first observations of a very young (<1 Myr) stellar\nobject in a band encompassing simultaneously both soft and hard X-rays. In\naddition to the hot Fe complex at 6.7 keV, we observed fluorescent emission\nfrom Fe at $\\sim6.4$ keV, confirming the previous findings. The line at 6.4 keV\nis detected during quiescent and flaring states and its flux is variable. The\nequivalent width is found varying in the $\\approx 0.15--0.5$ keV range. These\nvalues make unrealistic a simple model with a centrally illuminated disk and\nsuggest a role of the cavity containing Elias 29 and possibly reverberation\nprocesses that could occur in it. We observed two flares, with duration of 20\nks and 50 ks, respectively. We systematically observed an increase of $N_H$\nduring the flares of a factor five. This behavior has been observed during\nflares previously detected in Elias 29 with XMM-Newton and ASCA. The phenomenon\nhints that the flaring regions could be buried under the accretion streams and\nat high stellar latitudes, as the X-rays from flares pass through gas denser\nthan the gas along the line of sight of the quiescent corona. In a different\nscenario, a contribution from scattered soft photons to the primary coronal\nemission could mimic a shallower $N_H$ in the quiescent spectrum. In the\nspectrum of the full NuSTAR exposure, we detect hard X-ray emission in the band\n$\\approx20-80$ keV in excess with respect to the thermal emission. The hard\nX-ray emission could be due to a population of energetic electrons accelerated\nby the magnetic field along the accretion streams.

{"id": "1901.10970", "contents": "Title: Modelling the Effect of Mass-Draining on Prominence Eruptions Abstract: Quiescent solar prominences are observed to exist within the solar atmosphere\nfor up to several solar rotations. Their eruption is commonly preceded by a\nslow increase in height that can last from hours to days. This increase in the\nprominence height is believed to be due to their host magnetic flux rope\ntransitioning through a series of neighbouring quasi-equilibria before the main\nloss-of-equilibrium that drives the eruption. Recent work suggests that the\nremoval of prominence mass from a stable, quiescent flux rope is one possible\ncause for this change in height. However, these conclusions are drawn from\nobservations and are subject to interpretation. Here we present a simple model\nto quantify the effect of \"mass-draining\" during the pre-eruptive\nheight-evolution of a solar flux rope. The flux rope is modeled as a line\ncurrent suspended within a background potential magnetic field. We first show\nthat the inclusion of mass, up to $10^{12}$~kg, can modify the height at which\nthe line current experiences loss-of-equilibrium by up to 14\\%. Next, we show\nthat the rapid removal of mass prior to the loss-of-equilibrium can allow the\nheight of the flux rope to increase sharply and without upper bound as it\napproaches its loss-of-equilibrium point. This indicates that the critical\nheight for the loss-of-equilibrium can occur at a range of heights depending\nexplicitly on the amount and evolution of mass within the flux rope. Finally,\nwe demonstrate that for the same amount of drained mass, the effect on the\nheight of the flux rope is up to two order of magnitude larger for quiescent\nthan for active region prominences. \n\n"}
