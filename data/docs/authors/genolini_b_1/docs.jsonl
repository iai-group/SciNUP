For this purpose a set of evolution equations for the\nresponse to imposed test fields is solved with turbulent and mean motions\ncalculated from the momentum and continuity equations. The corresponding\nresults for the electromotive force are used to calculate turbulent transport\ncoefficients. The diagonal components of the turbulent magnetic diffusivity\ntensor are found to be very close together, but their values increase slightly\nwith increasing shear and decrease with increasing rotation rate. In the\npresence of shear, the sign of the two off-diagonal components of the turbulent\nmagnetic diffusion tensor is the same and opposite to the sign of the shear.\nThis implies that dynamo action from the shear--current effect is impossible,\nexcept perhaps for high magnetic Reynolds numbers.

Results: The\nalpha-effect increases monotonically as rotation increases. Turbulent\ndiffusivity, eta_t, is proportional to the square of the turbulent vertical\nvelocity. Whereas eta_t decreases approximately inversely proportional to the\nwavenumber of the field, the alpha-effect and turbulent pumping show a more\ncomplex behaviour. In the presence of shear and no rotation a small\nalpha-effect is induced which does not seem to show any consistent trend as a\nfunction of shear.

We use knowledge of hot Jupiters, mass\nloss estimates and models for the interior structure and evolution of planets\nto understand its composition, structure and evolution. The inferred mass and\nradius of CoRoT-7b are consistent with a rocky planet that would be depleted in\niron relative to Earth. However, a one sigma increase in mass (5.6 M_E) and\ndecrease in size (1.59 R_E) are compatible with an Earth-like composition (33%\niron, 67% silicates). Alternatively, it is possible that CoRoT-7b contains a\nsignificant amount of volatiles. An equally good fit to the data is found for a\nvapor envelope equal to 3% (and up to 10%) by mass above an Earth-like nucleus.\nBecause of its intense irradiation and small size, the planet cannot possess an\nenvelope of H and He of more than 1/10,000 of its total mass.

This\nquestion is particularly interesting for the case where the transmitted\nmessages and the feedback signals are subject to eavesdropping. In this work,\nwe investigate the question of how much impact the feedback has on the secrecy\ncapacity by studying two fundamental models. First, we consider the Gaussian\ntwo-way wiretap channel and derive an outer bound for its secrecy capacity\nregion. We show that the secrecy rate loss can be unbounded when feedback\nsignals are not utilized except for a special case we identify, and thus\nconclude that utilizing feedback can be highly beneficial in general.

In Shor's algorithm,\nsampling from the quantum Fourier spectrum is used to discover periodicity of\nthe modular exponentiation function. In a generalization of this idea, quantum\nFourier sampling can be used to discover hidden subgroup structures of some\nfunctions much more efficiently than it is possible classically. Another\nproblem for which the Fourier transform has been recruited successfully on a\nquantum computer is the hidden shift problem. Quantum algorithms for hidden\nshift problems usually have a slightly different flavor from hidden subgroup\nalgorithms, as they use the Fourier transform to perform a correlation with a\ngiven reference function, instead of sampling from the Fourier spectrum\ndirectly. In this paper we show that hidden shifts can be extracted efficiently\nfrom Boolean functions that are quadratic forms. We also show how to identify\nan unknown quadratic form on n variables using a linear number of queries, in\ncontrast to the classical case were this takes Theta(n^2) many queries to a\nblack box. What is more, we show that our quantum algorithm is robust in the\nsense that it can also infer the shift if the function is close to a quadratic,\nwhere we consider a Boolean function to be close to a quadratic if it has a\nlarge Gowers U_3 norm. \n\n"}

These seed\nphotons are then inverse-Compton scattered through a hot (but thermal) corona,\nproducing a hard X-ray power-law spectrum. We consider three different models\nfor the corona geometry: a wedge ``sandwich'' with aspect ratio H/R and\nvertically-integrated optical depth tau_0 constant throughout the disk; an\ninhomogeneous ``clumpy'' corona with a finite number of hot clouds distributed\nrandomly above the disk within a wedge geometry; and a spherical corona of\nuniform density, centered on the BH and surrounded by a truncated thermal disk\nwith inner radius R_edge.

Being\ndeterministic, the configuration space of a DFES can be divided into two\ndisjoint classes such that every configuration in one class should evolve into\none of absorbing states, whereas no configurations in the other class can reach\nan absorbing state. Since the two classes are separated in terms of toppling\ndynamics, the system can be made to exhibit an absorbing phase transition (APT)\nat various points that depend on the initial probability distribution of the\nconfigurations. Furthermore, we show that in general the transition point also\ndepends on whether an infinite-size limit is taken before or after the\ninfinite-time limit. To demonstrate, we numerically study the two-dimensional\nDFES with Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld toppling rule (BTW-FES). We confirm that there\nare indeed many thresholds. Nonetheless, the critical phenomena at various\ntransition points are found to be universal. We furthermore discuss a\nmicroscopic absorbing phase transition, or a so-called spreading dynamics, of\nthe BTW-FES, to find that the phase transition in this setting is related to\nthe dynamical isotropic percolation process rather than self-organized\ncriticality.

Results: Although the two considered thermonuclear\nsupernova explosion scenarios are expected to produce almost identical\nelectromagnetic output, their neutrino signatures appear vastly different,\nwhich allow an unambiguous identification of the explosion mechanism: a pure\ndeflagration produces a single peak in the neutrino light curve, while the\naddition of the second maximum characterizes a delayed-detonation.

However, the\nbroad spectrum of subsequent breakthroughs, surprises, and continuing puzzles\ncould only be partially anticipated. Since the release of the YR, the BESII\nprogram concluded only to give birth to BESIII; the $B$-factories and CLEO-c\nflourished; quarkonium production and polarization measurements at HERA and the\nTevatron matured; and heavy-ion collisions at RHIC have opened a window on the\ndeconfinement regime. All these experiments leave legacies of quality,\nprecision, and unsolved mysteries for quarkonium physics, and therefore beg for\ncontinuing investigations. The plethora of newly-found quarkonium-like states\nunleashed a flood of theoretical investigations into new forms of matter such\nas quark-gluon hybrids, mesonic molecules, and tetraquarks.

The presence of tiny grains in PPDs thus raises the\nquestion of whether the magnetorotational instability (MRI) is able to drive\nrapid accretion to be consistent with observations. Charged tiny grains have\nsimilar conduction properties as ions, whose presence leads to qualitatively\nnew behaviors in the conductivity tensor, characterized by n_bar/n_e>1, where\nn_e and n_bar denote the number densities of free electrons and all other\ncharged species respectively. In particular, Ohmic conductivity becomes\ndominated by charged grains rather than electrons when n_bar/n_e exceeds about\n10^3, and Hall and ambipolar diffusion (AD) coefficients are reduced by a\nfactor of (n_bar/n_e)^2 in the AD dominated regime relative to that in the\nOhmic regime. Applying the methodology of Bai (2011), we find that in PPDs,\nwhen PAHs are sufficiently abundant (>1e-9 per H_2), there exists a transition\nradius r_trans of about 10-20 AU, beyond which the MRI active layer extends to\nthe disk midplane. At r<r_trans, the optimistically predicted MRI-driven\naccretion rate M_dot is one to two orders of magnitude smaller than that in the\ngrain-free case, which is too small compared with the observed rates, but is in\ngeneral no smaller than the predicted M_dot with solar-abundance 0.1 micron\ngrains. At r>r_trans, we find that remarkably, the predicted M_dot exceeds the\ngrain-free case due to a net reduction of AD by charged tiny grains, and\nreaches a few times 1e-8M_Sun/yr. This is sufficient to account for the\nobserved M_dot in transitional disks. Larger grains (>0.1 micron) are too\nmassive to reach such high abundance as tiny grains and to facilitate the\naccretion process. \n\n"}

We carry out 2D\nshearing sheet simulations to study the linear regime of wave evolution with\nthe grid-based code Athena, and provide detailed comparisons with the\ntheoretical predictions. Low mass planets (down to ~0.03 Earth mass at 1 AU)\nand high spatial resolution (256 grid points per scale height) are chosen to\nmitigate the effects of wave nonlinearity. To complement the existing numerical\nstudies, we focus on the primary physical variables such as the spatial profile\nof the wave, torque density, and the angular momentum flux carried by the wave,\ninstead of secondary quantities such as the planetary migration rate. Our\nresults show percent level agreement with theory in both physical and Fourier\nspace. New phenomena such as the change of the toque density sign far from the\nplanet are discovered and discussed. Also, we explore the effect of the\nnumerical algorithms, and find that a high order of accuracy, high resolution,\nand an accurate planetary potential are crucial to achieve good agreement with\nthe theory. We find that the use of a too large time-step without properly\nresolving the dynamical time scale around the planet produces incorrect\nresults, and may lead to spurious gap opening.

Despite more than twenty years of experimental and theoretical\nworks, the order parameter of the transition at $T_0 = 17.5$ K is still\nunknown. The state below $T_0$ remains called \"hidden-order phase\" and the\nstakes are still to identify the energy scales driving the system to this\nphase. We present new magnetoresistivity and magnetization measurements\nperformed on very-high-quality single crystals in pulsed magnetic fields up to\n60 T. We show that the transition to the hidden-order state in URu$_2$Si$_2$ is\ninitially driven by a high-temperature crossover at around 40-50 K, which is a\nfingerprint of inter-site electronic correlations. In a magnetic field\n$\\mathbf{H}$ applied along the easy-axis $\\bf{c}$, the vanishing of this\nhigh-temperature scale precedes the polarization of the magnetic moments, as\nwell as it drives the destabilization of the hidden-order phase.

The best-fit values of the\nGaussian bias factors and their non-Gaussian, scale-independent corrections are\nin qualitative agreement with the peak-background split expectations. In\nparticular, we show that the effect of non-Gaussian initial conditions on\nsqueezed configurations is fairly large (up to 30% for f_NL=100 at redshift\nz=0.5) and results from contributions of similar amplitude induced by the\ninitial matter bispectrum, scale-dependent bias corrections as well as from\nnonlinear matter bispectrum corrections.

In a class of such\nmodels, like the generalized Sakai-Sugimoto model, baryons take the form of\ninstantons of the effective flavor gauge theory that resides on probe flavor\nbranes. In this paper we study the phase structure of baryonic crystals by\nanalyzing discrete periodic configurations of such instantons. We find that\ninstanton configurations exhibit a series of \"popcorn\" transitions upon\nincreasing the density. Through these transitions normal (3D) lattices expand\ninto the transverse dimension, eventually becoming a higher dimensional (4D)\nmulti-layer lattice at large densities.\n  We consider 3D lattices of zero size instantons as well as 1D periodic chains\nof finite size instantons, which serve as toy models of the full holographic\nsystems. In particular, for the finite-size case we determine solutions of the\ncorresponding ADHM equations for both a straight chain and for a 2D zigzag\nconfiguration where instantons pop up into the holographic dimension. At low\ndensity the system takes the form of an \"abelian anti-ferromagnetic\" straight\nperiodic chain. Above a critical density there is a second order phase\ntransition into a zigzag structure. An even higher density yields a rich phase\nspace characterized by the formation of multi-layer zigzag structures. The\nfinite size of the lattices in the transverse dimension is a signal of an\nemerging Fermi sea of quarks.

The young stellar\nmass in the head scales linearly with restframe galaxy luminosity, ranging from\n~10^5 M_solar at galaxy absolute magnitude U=-13 mag to 10^9 M_solar at U=-20\nmag. The corresponding head surface density increases from several M_solar\npc^{-2} locally to 10-100 M_solar pc^{-2} at high redshift, and the star\nformation rate per unit area in the head increases from ~0.01 M_solar yr^{-1}\nkpc^{-2} locally to ~1 M_solar yr^{-1} kpc^{-2} at high z.

K. Sanyal, B. Modak, C. Rubano and E. Piedipalumbo,\nGen.Relativ.Grav.37, 407 (2005), arXiv:astro-ph/0310610) for scalar tensor\ntheory of gravity in the presence of R^2 term. Thus, R can not be treated as an\nauxiliary variable and hence Noether symmetry of arbitrary form of F(R) theory\nof gravity remains obscure. However, there exists in general, a conserved\ncurrent for F(R) theory of gravity in the presence of a non-minimally coupled\nscalar-tensor theory (A. K. Sanyal, Phys.Lett.B624, 81 (2005),\narXiv:hep-th/0504021 and Mod.Phys.Lett.A25, 2667 (2010), arXiv:0910.2385\n[astro-ph.CO]). Here, we briefly expatiate the non-Noether conserved current\nand cite an example to reveal its importance in finding cosmological solution\nfor such an action, taking F(R) \\propto R^{3/2}. \n\n"}

The\nsimulations include vertical stratification and assume zero net vertical\nmagnetic flux.

Turbulence dies away for\nAm < 1, and becomes progressively more vigorous as ambipolar diffusion is\ndecreased. Near-ideal MHD behavior is recovered for Am > 1000. In the\nintermediate regime (10 < Am < 1000) ambipolar diffusion leads to substantial\nincreases in both the period of the MRI dynamo cycle and the characteristic\nscales of magnetic field structures.

Morphologies for the AGN host galaxies were derived from the\nGalaxy Zoo project.\n  Our results suggest that broad-line AGN and narrow-line AGN reside in widely\ndifferent environments where the neighbours to Type-2 AGN are more star-forming\nand bluer than those of Type-1 AGN. There is a colour-dependency only\ndetectable in the neighbours with photometric redshifts for the Type-2 AGN.

Moreover, three fast and very {\\it magnetic} white dwarfs (WDs)\nhave also been observed in the last years. Based on these new pulsar\ndiscoveries, we compare and contrast the magnetic fields, magnetic dipole\nmoment, characteristic ages, and X-ray steady luminosities of these two SGRs\n(in the WD model) with three fast white dwarfs, to conclude that they show\nstrong similarities corroborating an alternative description of several\nSGRs/AXPs as very massive and magnetic white dwarfs. The pulsar magnetic dipole\nmoment $m$ depending only on the momentum of inertia $I$, and observational\nproperties, such as the period $P$ and its first time derivative $\\dot{P}$, can\nhelp to identify the scale of $I$ for SGRs/AXPs. We analyze the pulsar magnetic\ndipole moment $m$ of SGRs and AXPs when a model based on a massive fast\nrotating highly magnetized white dwarf is considered. We show that the values\nfor $m$ obtained for several SGRs and AXPs are in agreement with the observed\nrange $10^{34}{\\rm emu}\\leq m \\leq10^{36}{\\rm emu}$ of isolated and polar\nmagnetic white dwarfs. This result together with the fact that for {\\it\nmagnetic} white dwarfs $B\\sim(10^6-10^8)$ G their magnetic dipole moments are\nalmost independent of the star rotation period ($10^{4}\\lesssim P\n\\lesssim10^{6} {\\rm s}$) - a phenomenology not shared by neutron stars pulsars\n- suggests a possible {\\it magnetic} white dwarf nature for some of SGRs/AXPs\nthat have much smaller periods ($P\\sim 10$ s). \n\n"}

Such gamma-rays should\ntherefore exhibit strong correlation with the cosmic shear signal. In this\nLetter, we compute the cross-correlation angular power spectrum of cosmic shear\nand gamma-rays produced by the annihilation/decay of Weakly Interacting Massive\nParticle (WIMP) DM, as well as from astrophysical sources.

A theoretical framework is derived\nthat validates this suggestion, and provides predictions of ghost formation in\na two-source scenario. The predictions are found to accurately match the result\nof simulations, and qualitatively reproduce the ghosts previously seen in\nobservational data. The theory also provides explanations for many previously\npuzzling features of these artefacts (regular geometry, PSF-like sidelobes,\nseeming independence on model flux), and shows that the observed phenomenon of\nflux suppression affecting unmodelled sources is due to the same mechanism.

We employ self-consistent\nGreen's function (SCGF) theory which allows a comprehensive calculation of the\nsingle particle spectral function. For the closed subshell isotopes, $^{14}$O,\n$^{16}$O, $^{22}$O, $^{24}$O and $^{28}$O, we perform calculations with the\nDyson-ADC(3) method. The remaining open shell isotopes are studied using the\nnewly developed Gorkov-SCGF formalism up to second order. We produce plots for\nthe full-fledged spectral distributions. The spectroscopic factors for the\ndominant quasiparticle peaks are found to depend very little on the leading\norder (NNLO) chiral 3NFs. The latters have small impact on the calculated\nmatter radii, which, however are consistently obtained smaller than experiment.\nSimilarly, single particle spectra tend to be diluted with respect to\nexperiment. This effect might hinder, to some extent, the onset of correlations\nand screen the quenching of calculated spectroscopic factors. The most\nimportant effects of 3NFs is thus the fine tuning of the energies for the\ndominant quasiparticle states, which govern the shell evolution and the\nposition of driplines. Although present chiral NNLO 3NFs interactions do\nreproduce the binding energies correctly in this mass region, the details of\nthe nuclear wave function remain at odd with the experiment showing too small\nradii and a too dilute single particle spectrum, similar to what already\npointed out for larger masses.

The theoretical analysis of these data\nconfirms the onset of the high energy eikonal regime in the scattering process\nwhich allows one to separate long range nuclear effects from the effects\ngenuinely related to the short distance structure of the deuteron.

{"id": "1504.03225", "contents": "Title: Nonlocal Quantization Principle in Quantum Field Theory and Quantum\n  Gravity Abstract: In this paper a nonlocal generalization of field quantization is suggested.\nThis quantization principle presupposes the assumption that the commutator\nbetween a field operator an the operator of the canonical conjugated variable\nreferring to other space-time points does not vanish as it is postulated in the\nusual setting of quantum field theory. Based on this presupposition the\ncorresponding expressions for the field operators, the eigenstates and the path\nintegral formula are determined. The nonlocal quantization principle also leads\nto a generalized propagator. If the dependence of the commutator between\noperators on different space-time points on the distance of these points is\nassumed to be described by a Gaussian function, one obtains that the propagator\nis damped by an exponential. This leads to a disappearance of UV divergences.\nThe transfer of the nonlocal quantization principle to canonical quantum\ngravity is considered as well. In this case the commutator has to be assumed to\ndepend also on the gravitational field, since the distance between two points\ndepends on the metric field. \n\n"}

While an adiabatic approach is often\nsufficient to get information on the stellar equilibrium structures it is not\nsufficient to get a full understanding of the physics of the oscillation.\nIndeed, it does not permit one to answer some fundamental questions about the\noscillations, such as: What are the physical mechanisms responsible for the\npulsations inside stars?

All these questions can only be addressed by\nconsidering the energy exchanges between the oscillations and the surrounding\nmedium.\n  This lecture therefore aims at considering the energetical aspects of stellar\npulsations with particular emphasis on the driving and damping mechanisms.

Once the\nnetwork operates in this configuration, it performs efficiently on a specific\napplication both in terms of (i) low prediction error and (ii) high short-term\nmemory capacity. Since the behavior of recurrent networks is strongly\ninfluenced by the particular input signal driving the dynamics, a universal,\napplication-independent method for determining the edge of criticality is still\nmissing. In this paper, we aim at addressing this issue by proposing a\ntheoretically motivated, unsupervised method based on Fisher information for\ndetermining the edge of criticality in recurrent neural networks. It is proven\nthat Fisher information is maximized for (finite-size) systems operating in\nsuch critical regions.

In this paper, we propose Feature Driven\nSelective Classification (FALCON) inspired by the biological visual attention\nmechanism in the brain to optimize the energy-efficiency of machine-learning\nclassifiers. We use the consensus in the characteristic features\n(color/texture) across images in a dataset to decompose the original\nclassification problem and construct a tree of classifiers (nodes) with a\ngeneric-to-specific transition in the classification hierarchy. The initial\nnodes of the tree separate the instances based on feature information and\nselectively enable the latter nodes to perform object specific classification.\nThe proposed methodology allows selective activation of only those branches and\nnodes of the classification tree that are relevant to the input while keeping\nthe remaining nodes idle.

The bias\nmanifests not only in the obvious case of trying to decide if the universe as a\nwhole has a winding bias, but also in the more insidious case of selecting\nwhich galaxies to include in a winding direction survey. While the former bias\nhas been accounted for in a previous image-mirroring study, the latter has not.\nFurthermore, the bias has never been {\\em corrected} in the GZ1 catalog, as\nonly a small sample of the GZ1 catalog was re-examined during the mirror study.\nWe show that the existing bias is a human {\\em selection} effect rather than a\nhuman chirality bias.

Our main technical\ncontribution is a decremental data structure that supports sensitivity queries\nof the form \"are $ u $ and $ v $ strongly connected in the graph $ G \\setminus\nw $?\", for any triple of vertices $ u, v, w $, while $ G $ undergoes deletions\nof edges. Our data structure processes a sequence of edge deletions in a\ndigraph with $n$ vertices in $O(m n \\log{n})$ total time and $O(n^2 \\log{n})$\nspace, where $m$ is the number of edges before any deletion, and answers the\nabove queries in constant time.

The interacting diffusions pave a way to\nprobabilistic representations for many important nonlinear/nonlocal PDEs, but\nprovide a great challenge for Monte Carlo simulations. This is due to the\nnonlinear dependence of the bias on the statistical error arising through the\napproximation of the law of the process. This and the fact that\nparticles/diffusions are not independent render classical variance reduction\ntechniques not directly applicable and consequently make simulations of\ninteracting diffusions prohibitive. In this article, we provide an alternative\niterative particle representation, inspired by the fixed point argument by\nSznitman \\cite{sznitman1991topics}. This new representation has the same mean\nfield limit as the classical SIPS. However, unlike classical SIPS, it also\nallows decomposing the statistical error and the approximation bias.

This bound is tight and there is a related lower bound of\n$\\mathcal{O}(|X|^{d+2-\\epsilon})$ on the bit size of kernels.\n  In fact, we also get bounds for minimal blocking sets of more general graph\nclasses: For $d$-quasi-bipartite graphs, where each connected component can be\nmade bipartite by deleting at most $d$ vertices, we get the same tight bound of\n$d+2$ vertices.

Predictive state\npolicy networks consist of a recursive filter, which keeps track of a belief\nabout the state of the environment, and a reactive policy that directly maps\nbeliefs to actions, to maximize the cumulative reward. The recursive filter\nleverages predictive state representations (PSRs) (Rosencrantz and Gordon,\n2004; Sun et al., 2016) by modeling predictive state-- a prediction of the\ndistribution of future observations conditioned on history and future actions.\nThis representation gives rise to a rich class of statistically consistent\nalgorithms (Hefny et al., 2018) to initialize the recursive filter.

A systematic study of the beam energy dependence is performed for Au+Au\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} =2.3 - 62.4$ GeV. The transition of the dynamical\norigin of the directed flow is observed. We find that the initial Glauber type\nnucleon-nucleon collisions generate negative $v_1$ for nucleons at midrapidity\ndue to the presence of spectator matter, and this negative nucleon $v_1$ is\nturned to be positive by the meson-baryon interactions at the beam energy\nregion of $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} < 30$ GeV.

Abstract: For an extension of the previous work on gravitational lensing by massless\nbraneworld black holes, we investigate their microlensing phenomena and shadows\nand discuss how to distinguish them from standard Schwarzschild black holes and\nEllis wormholes. Microlensing is known as the phenomenon in which luminosity\namplification appears when a bright object passes behind a black hole or\nanother massive object. We find that, for the braneworld black hole as well as\nfor the Ellis wormhole, there appears luminosity reduction just before and\nafter the amplification. This means that observation of such a reduction would\nindicate the lens object is either a braneworld black hole or a wormhole,\nthough it is difficult to distinguish one from the other by microlensing\nsolely. Therefore, we next analyze the optical images, or shadows of the\nbraneworld black hole surrounded by optically thin dust, and compare them to\nthose of the Ellis wormhole. Because the spacetime around the braneworld black\nhole possesses unstable circular orbits of photons, a bright ring appears in\nthe image, just as in Schwarzschild spacetime or in the wormhole spacetime.\nThis indicates that the appearance of a bright ring does not solely confirm a\nbraneworld black hole, a Schwarzschild, nor an Ellis wormhole. However, we find\nthat only for the wormhole is the intensity inside the ring larger than that\nthe outsider intensity. Therefore, with future high-resolution observations of\nmicrolensing and shadows together, we could identify the braneworld black holes\nif they exist. \n\n"}

Furthermore, it is found that the streamwise coupling between phases\nis the dominant factor in damping the turbulence and is highly related to the\nspatial distribution of the particles. The presence of particles in different\nturbulent coherent structures (large scale vortices or large scale streaks)\ndetermines the turbulent kinetic energy of particulate phase, which is related\nto the particle response time scaled by the turnover time of large scale\nvortices.

The values of\nthe particles' relative density (1.5) and of the Galileo number (180) are such\nthat strong wake-induced particle clustering would occur in the absence of\nturbulence. The forced turbulence in the two present cases (with Taylor-scale\nReynolds number 95 and 140) would lead to mild levels of clustering in the\nabsence of gravity. Here we detect a tendency to cluster with an intensity\nwhich is intermediate between these two limiting cases, meaning that forced\nbackground turbulence decreases the level of clustering otherwise observed\nunder ambient settling. However, the clustering strength does not monotonously\ndecay with the relative turbulence intensity. Various mechanisms by which\ncoherent structures can affect particle motion are discussed. It is argued that\nthe reduced interaction time due to particle settling through the surrounding\neddy (crossing trajectories) has the effect of shifting upwards the range of\neddies with a time scale matching the characteristic time scale of the\nparticle. In the present cases this shift might bring the particles into\nresonance with the energetic eddies of the turbulent spectrum.

In this paper, we show that under certain\nconditions, testing for instrumental variables is possible. We build upon prior\nwork on necessary tests to derive a test that characterizes the odds of being a\nvalid instrument, thus yielding the name \"necessary and probably sufficient\".\nThe test works by defining the class of invalid-IV and valid-IV causal models\nas Bayesian generative models and comparing their marginal likelihood based on\nobserved data. When all variables are discrete, we also provide a method to\nefficiently compute these marginal likelihoods.\n  We evaluate the test on an extensive set of simulations for binary data,\ninspired by an open problem for IV testing proposed in past work.

If black hole\nformation occurs relatively early, within a few ($\\sim 1$) seconds after core\ncollapse, then the expected luminosities are of order $L_{BH} = 10^{52}$ erg/s\nper flavor. In this case, the neutrino mass sensitivity can be extraordinary.\nFor a supernova at a distance $D = 10$ kpc, SuperKamiokande can detect a\n$\\bar{\\nu}_e$ mass down to 1.8 eV by comparing the arrival times of the\nhigh-energy and low-energy neutrinos in $\\bar{\\nu}_e + p \\to e^+ + n$. This\ntest will also measure the cutoff time, and will thus allow a mass test of\n$\\nu_\\mu$ and $\\nu_\\tau$ relative to $\\bar{\\nu}_e$. Assuming that $\\nu_\\mu$ and\n$\\nu_\\tau$ are nearly degenerate, as suggested by the atmospheric neutrino\nresults, masses down to about 6 eV can be probed with a proposed lead detector\nof mass $M_D = 4$ kton (OMNIS). Remarkably, the neutrino mass sensitivity\nscales as $(D/L_{BH} M_D)^{1/2}$.

(2) How much do E/S0 galaxies contribute to the\ncounts in deep mid-infrared (MIR: 3 -- 20$\\mu m$) surveys? Among three new\nmodels for evolution of dusty galaxies, it is assumed in Model S1 that\nstarburst galaxies are the dominant population, and in Model S2 that normal\ngalaxies dominate. Model S3 is an intermediate model. Comparing the model\npredictions with a wide range of observational data collected from the\nliterature, we find that none of these models can be ruled out, given the\nuncertainties of the data.

With the high resolution imaging data we confirm and extend the\nearlier impression that the cluster has a lot of substructure. Two maxima of\nthe cluster emission are obvious in the images, each of them shows even some\ninternal structure. For the total luminosity of the cluster in the ROSAT band\nwe obtain L = 6.4_{-0.3}^{+0.7} 10^{44} erg/s. We perform spectral fits for the\ntwo ASCA instruments and for the ROSAT/PSPC simultaneously. The most reliable\nnumbers for the temperature and metallicity for the intracluster gas are T =\n7.6^{+2.8}_{-1.6} keV and m = 0.22^{+0.24}_{-0.22} Msol, respectively. We find\na relatively small total mass, a small gas mass ratio and a small iron mass to\nlight ratio.

Abstract: A future core-collapse supernova in our Galaxy will be detected by several\nneutrino detectors around the world. The neutrinos escape from the supernova\ncore over several seconds from the time of collapse, unlike the electromagnetic\nradiation, emitted from the envelope, which is delayed by a time of order\nhours. In addition, the electromagnetic radiation can be obscured by dust in\nthe intervening interstellar space. The question therefore arises whether a\nsupernova can be located by its neutrinos alone. The early warning of a\nsupernova and its location might allow greatly improved astronomical\nobservations. The theme of the present work is a careful and realistic\nassessment of this question, taking into account the statistical significance\nof the various neutrino signals. Not surprisingly, neutrino-electron forward\nscattering leads to a good determination of the supernova direction, even in\nthe presence of the large and nearly isotropic background from other reactions.\nEven with the most pessimistic background assumptions, SuperKamiokande (SK) and\nthe Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) can restrict the supernova direction to\nbe within circles of radius $5^\\circ$ and $20^\\circ$, respectively. Other\nreactions with more events but weaker angular dependence are much less useful\nfor locating the supernova. Finally, there is the oft-discussed possibility of\ntriangulation, i.e., determination of the supernova direction based on an\narrival time delay between different detectors. Given the expected statistics\nwe show that, contrary to previous estimates, this technique does not allow a\ngood determination of the supernova direction. \n\n"}

Different\nattempts to explain this departure from normality have coexisted. In\nparticular, since one of the strong assumptions of the Gaussian model concerns\nthe volatility, considered finite and constant, the new models were built on a\nnon finite (Mandelbrot 1963) or non constant (Cox, Ingersoll and Ross 1985)\nvolatility. We investigate in this thesis a very recent model (Dragulescu et\nal. 2002) based on a Brownian motion process for the returns, and a stochastic\nmean-reverting process for the volatility. In this model, the forward\nKolmogorov equation that governs the time evolution of returns is solved\nanalytically.
