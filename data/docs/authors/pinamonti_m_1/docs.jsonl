We focus\non the cases where the decay products of the top quark are reconstructed as a\nsingle jet, a \"top-jet\". The most basic \"top-tag\" method based on jet mass\nmeasurement is considered in detail. To analyze the top-tagging method,\ntheoretical and experimental aspects of the QCD jet background are examined.\nBased on QCD factorization, we derive a simple analytic approximation for the\nshape of the QCD jet mass spectrum.

Since the\nlight-neutrino mass must be less than an eV or so, the mixing would be very\nsmall, even for a heavy-neutrino mass of order a few hundred GeV. This would\nmake it unlikely to test the model directly at the LHC, as the amplitude for\nproducing the heavy neutrino is proportional to the mixing size. However, it\nhas been realized for some time that, with more than one generation of light\nand heavy neutrinos, the mixing can be significantly larger in certain\nsituations.

Assuming\nthe Higgs is a fundamental scalar, we find: 1) the coefficient of O_H is\npositive except when there are triplet scalars, resulting in a reduction in the\nHiggs on-shell coupling from their standard model (SM) expectations if no other\noperators contribute, 2) the linear combination of O_H and O_y controlling the\noverall Higgs coupling to fermion is always reduced, 3) the sign of O_g induced\nby a new colored fermion is such that it interferes destructively with the SM\ntop contribution in the gluon fusion production of the Higgs, if the new\nfermion cancels the top quadratic divergence in the Higgs mass, and 4) the\ncorrelation between naturalness and the sign of O_gamma is similar to that of\nO_g, when there is a new set of heavy electroweak gauge bosons. Next\nconsidering a composite scalar for the Higgs, we find the reduction in the\non-shell Higgs couplings persists.

In the chiral limit, when the pairing gap is\nparity even, the right-handed and left-handed sectors of the free space\nHamiltonian have nontrivial topological charges with opposite signs.\nAccordingly, a vortex line in the superconductor supports localized gapless\nright-handed and left-handed fermions with the dispersion relations E=+/-vp_z\n(v is a parameter dependent velocity) and thus propagating in opposite\ndirections along the vortex line. However, the presence of the fermion mass\nimmediately opens up a mass gap for such localized fermions and the dispersion\nrelations become E=+/-v(m^2+p_z^2)^(1/2). When the pairing gap is parity odd,\nthe situation is qualitatively different. The right-handed and left-handed\nsectors of the free space Hamiltonian in the chiral limit have nontrivial\ntopological charges with the same sign and therefore the presence of the small\nfermion mass does not open up a mass gap for the fermions localized around the\nvortex line. When the fermion mass is increased further, there is a topological\nphase transition at m=(\\mu^2+\\Delta^2)^(1/2) and the localized gapless fermions\ndisappear. We also elucidate the existence of gapless surface fermions\nlocalized at a boundary when two phases with different topological charges are\nconnected. A part of our results is relevant to the color superconductivity of\nquarks. \n\n"}

Here, we\ngeneralize and improve on N-subjettiness by minimizing over all possible subjet\ndirections, using a new variant of the k-means clustering algorithm. On boosted\ntop benchmark samples from the BOOST2010 workshop, we demonstrate that a simple\ncut on the 3-subjettiness to 2-subjettiness ratio yields 20% (50%) tagging\nefficiency for a 0.23% (4.1%) fake rate, making N-subjettiness a highly\neffective boosted top tagger.

In\nthis paper, we make several suggestions to try to clarify the role of new\nphysics in these results. We propose that the enhancement needed in the\nStandard Model to attribute the observed CP violation in D to two pseudoscalar\nmodes may not operate for inclusive final states where asymmetries will likely\napproximate the quark level expectation. Experimentally testing this principle\nrequires a search for CP asymmetries in final states containing K and K-bar\nwith a total energy of less than M_D. We also propose that CP asymmetries may\nbe enhanced in modes where the tree is color suppressed. In particular, the\nfinal state rho0 rho0 is of special interest; similarly Ds-> rho0 K+ and rho0\nK*+ likewise appear interesting. We discuss how isospin symmetry yields\nobservables sensitive to certain classes of new physics and suppressed in the\nStandard Model.

In situations in which a single H^0 or A^0\ndominates NP contributions stringent correlations between Delta F=2 and Delta\nF=1 observables exist. Anticipating the Flavour Precision Era ahead of us we\nillustrate this by searching for allowed oases in the landscape of a given\nmodel assuming significantly smaller uncertainties in CKM and hadronic\nparameters than presently available.

These data are\nsupplemented with spectra from previous observations with the HIRES and HARPS\nspectrographs, and V- and R-band photometry taken over 6 years at the Dyer and\nFairborn observatories. Previous studies of GJ 176 revealed a super-Earth\nexoplanet in an 8.8-day orbit. However, the velocities of this star are also\nknown to be contaminated by activity, particularly at the 39-day stellar\nrotation period.

The sodium index is well correlated with our RVs, and we show\nthat this activity trend drives a corresponding slope in RV.

Higgs boson production in gluon fusion constitutes an irreducible\nbackground to the vector boson fusion (VBF) process; hence the precise\nknowledge of its characteristics is a prerequisite for any measurement in the\nVBF channel.

We\nfirst show that the Standard Model (SM) Higgs Lagrangian is equivalent to the\nscale-invariant nonlinear chiral Lagrangian, which is further gauge equivalent\nto the scale-invariant HLS model, with the scale symmetry realized nonlinearly\nvia SM Higgs as a (pseudo-) dilaton. The scale symmetry forbids the new vector\nboson decay to the 125 GeV Higgs plus W/Z boson, in sharp contrast to the\nconventional \"equivalence theorem\" which is invalidated by the conformality.\nThe HLS forbids mixing between the iso-triplet technirho's, rho_{Pi} and\nrho_{P}, of the one-family walking technicolor (with four doublets\nN_D=N_F/2=4), which, without the HLS, would be generated when switching on the\nstandard model gauging.

Instead of regularizing using a roughness penalty or\nstopping iterative methods early, we impose physically motivated shape\nconstraints: positivity, monotonicity, and convexity.

At the same time, a persistent gap lingers between\ntheoretical approaches grounded in Euclidean methods (e.g., lattice QCD,\nDyson-Schwinger Equations [DSEs]) as opposed to traditional Minkowski field\ntheories (such as light-front constituent quark models). ${\\bf Purpose}$\nSeeking to bridge these complementary worldviews, we explore the potential of a\nEuclidean constituent quark model (ECQM). This formalism enables us to study\nthe gluonic dressing of the quark-level axial-vector vertex, which we undertake\nas a test of the framework. ${\\bf Method}$ To access its indispensable elements\nwith a minimum of inessential detail, we develop our ECQM using the simplified\nquark $+$ scalar diquark picture of the nucleon. We construct a hyperspherical\nformalism involving polynomial expansions of diquark propagators to marry our\nECQM with the results of Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE) analyses, and constrain\nmodel parameters by fitting electromagnetic form factor data. ${\\bf Results}$\nFrom this formalism, we define and compute a new quantity --- the Euclidean\ndensity function (EDF) --- an object that characterizes the nucleon's various\ncharge distributions as functions of the quark's Euclidean momentum. Applying\nthis technology and incorporating information from BSE analyses, we find the\ndressing effect on the proton's axial-singlet charge to be small in magnitude\nand consistent with zero. ${\\bf Conclusions}$ The scalar quark $+$ diquark ECQM\nis a step toward a realistic quark model in Euclidean space, and urges\nadditional refinements. The small size we obtain for the impact of the dressed\nvertex on the axial-singlet charge suggests that models without this effect are\non firm ground to neglect it. \n\n"}

The strange quark mass is tuned to its\nphysical value and we use two strange to light quark mass ratios $m_s/m_l=20$\nand $27$, which in the continuum limit correspond to a pion mass of about $160$\nMeV and $140$ MeV espectively. Sixth-order results for Taylor expansion\ncoefficients are used to estimate truncation errors of the fourth-order\nexpansion. We show that truncation errors are small for baryon chemical\npotentials less then twice the temperature ($\\mu_B\\le 2T$). The fourth-order\nequation of state thus is suitable for the modeling of dense matter created in\nheavy ion collisions with center-of-mass energies down to $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}\\sim\n12$ GeV.

The\nthermodynamic properties of a relativistic ideal gas of hadron resonances are\nstudied. It is found that this generic statistics satisfies the requirements of\nthe equilibrium thermodynamics. Essential aspects of thermodynamic\nself-consistency are clarified. Analytical expressions are proposed for the\nstatistical fits of various transverse momentum distributions measured in\nmost-central collisions at different collision energies and colliding systems.\nEstimations for the freezeout temperature and chemical potential and both c and\nd are determined.

The resulting equivalence class (c,d) is associated to\nstretched exponentials, where Lambert function reaches its asymptotic\nstability.

Here, we explore these issues in the context of\nsome simple JHU/CMS-type declustering algorithms and the N-subjettiness\njet-shape variable tau_32.

We\nthen introduce a basic fast detector simulation, including electromagnetic\ncalorimeter showering patterns determined from GEANT. We consider a number of\ntricks for processing the fast detector output back to an approximate\nparticle-level picture. Re-optimizing the tagger parameters, we demonstrate\nthat the inevitable losses in discrimination power at very high energies can\ntypically be ameliorated.

Seven M-dwarfs included in the CARMENES sample had\nbeen observed before with HIRES and HARPS and either were reported to have one\nshort period planetary companion (GJ15A, GJ176, GJ436, GJ536 and GJ1148) or are\nmultiple planetary systems (GJ581 and GJ876).\n  Aims: We aim to report new precise optical radial velocity measurements for\nthese planet hosts and test the overall capabilities of CARMENES.\n  Methods: We combined our CARMENES precise Doppler measurements with those\navailable from HIRES and HARPS and derived new orbital parameters for the\nsystems. Bona-fide single planet systems are fitted with a Keplerian model. The\nmultiple planet systems were analyzed using a self-consistent dynamical model\nand their best fit orbits were tested for long-term stability.\n  Results: We confirm or provide supportive arguments for planets around all\nthe investigated stars except for GJ15A, for which we find that the\npost-discovery HIRES data and our CARMENES data do not show a signal at 11.4\ndays. Although we cannot confirm the super-Earth planet GJ15Ab, we show\nevidence for a possible long-period ($P_{\\rm c}$ = 7025$_{-629}^{+972}$ d)\nSaturn-mass ($m_{\\rm c} \\sin i$ = 51.8$_{-5.8}^{+5.5}M_\\oplus$) planet around\nGJ15A. In addition, based on our CARMENES and HIRES data we discover a second\nplanet around GJ1148, for which we estimate a period $P_{\\rm c}$ =\n532.6$_{-2.5}^{+4.1}$ d, eccentricity $e_{\\rm c}$ = 0.34$_{-0.06}^{+0.05}$ and\nminimum mass $m_{\\rm c} \\sin i$ = 68.1$_{-2.2}^{+4.9}M_\\oplus$.\n  Conclusions: The CARMENES optical radial velocities have similar precision\nand overall scatter when compared to the Doppler measurements conducted with\nHARPS and HIRES. We conclude that CARMENES is an instrument that is up to the\nchallenge of discovering rocky planets around low-mass stars. \n\n"}

However, these techniques\nare time consuming and their convergence to the posterior could be difficult to\ndetermine. In this work, we advocate Variational inference as an alternative to\nsolve the above problems, and demonstrate its usefulness for parameter\nestimation and model selection in Astrophysics. Variational inference converts\nthe inference problem into an optimization problem by approximating the\nposterior from a known family of distributions and using Kullback-Leibler\ndivergence to characterize the difference. It takes advantage of fast\noptimization techniques, which make it ideal to deal with large datasets and\nmakes it trivial to parallelize on a multicore platform. We also derive a new\napproximate evidence estimation based on variational posterior, and importance\nsampling technique called posterior weighted importance sampling for the\ncalculation of evidence (PWISE), which is useful to perform Bayesian model\nselection. As a proof of principle, we apply variational inference to five\ndifferent problems in astrophysics, where Monte Carlo techniques were\npreviously used. These include assessment of significance of annual modulation\nin the COSINE-100 dark matter experiment, measuring exoplanet orbital\nparameters from radial velocity data, tests of periodicities in measurements of\nNewton's constant $G$, assessing the significance of a turnover in the spectral\nlag data of GRB 160625B and estimating the mass of a galaxy cluster using weak\ngravitational lensing.

The key point is the\nuse of a realistic probability distribution for each hit (heteroscedasticity).\nTwo different methods are used for the fits, the first method introduces an\neffective variance for each hit, the second method implements the maximum\nlikelihood search.

These\nproblems can be cured by introducing a mixing between the singlet scalar $s$\nand the SM Higgs boson $h$.

As\na specific example, we consider the dark matter (DM) search in the $t \\bar{t} +\nE_{T}^{\\text{miss}}$ channel.

For convincing conclusions, analysis methods are\nneeded which offer an unambiguous comparison between data and theory while\nallowing reliable estimates of uncertainties. The Matrix Element Method (MEM)\nis a Maximum Likelihood method which is especially tailored for signal searches\nand parameter estimation at colliders. The MEM has proven to be beneficial due\nto optimal use of the available information and a clean statistical\ninterpretation of the results. But it has a big drawback: In its original\nformulation, the likelihood calculation is intrinsically limited to the leading\nperturbative order in the coupling. Higher-order corrections improve the\naccuracy of theoretical predictions and allow for unambiguous field-theoretical\ninterpretation of the extracted information. In this work, the MEM\nincorporating corrections of next-to-leading order (NLO) in QCD by defining\nevent weights suited for the likelihood calculation is presented for the first\ntime.

For massless\naxion field, in all these three formalism, we reproduce, at the leading order,\nthe exact scale-invariant power spectrum which is well known in the literature.\nWe observe that due to quantum entanglement, the sub-leading terms for these\nthee formalisms are different. Thus, such correction terms break the degeneracy\namong the analysis of the FOE, RDM and NES formalisms in the super-horizon\nlimit.

The effective mass is produced mainly due to the forward quark-quark\nscattering mediated by the longitudinal (in sense of Gauss' law) magnetic\nfields.

We describe the BraneCode, an algorithm which we\ndesigned to solve the dynamical equations numerically. We applied the BraneCode\nto braneworld models and found several novel phenomena of the brane dynamics.\nStarting with static warped geometry with de Sitter branes, we found\nnumerically that this configuration is often unstable due to a tachyonic mass\nof the radion during inflation. If the model admits other static configurations\nwith lower values of de Sitter curvature, this effect causes a violent\nre-structuring towards them, flattening the branes, which appears as a lowering\nof the 4d effective cosmological constant. Braneworld dynamics can often lead\nto brane collisions.

We\npresent a complete quasiclassical treatment of the BPS sector of this model,\nincluding the full set of the first-order equations, derivations of all\nrelevant zero modes, and derivation of an effective low-energy theory for the\ncorresponding collective coordinates. The macroscopic description is provided\nby a CP(1) model with or without twisted mass.

Abstract: We study the gravitational collapse of compact objects in the Brane-World. We\nbegin by arguing that the regularity of the five-dimensional geodesics does not\nallow the energy-momentum tensor of matter on the brane to have (step-like)\ndiscontinuities, which are instead admitted in the four-dimensional General\nRelativistic case, and compact sources must therefore have an atmosphere. Under\nthe simplifying assumption that matter is a spherically symmetric cloud of dust\nwithout dissipation, we can find the conditions for which the collapsing star\ngenerically ``evaporates'' and approaches the Hawking behavior as the\n(apparent) horizon is being formed. Subsequently, the apparent horizon evolves\ninto the atmosphere and the back-reaction on the brane metric reduces the\nevaporation, which continues until the effective energy of the star vanishes.\nThis occurs at a finite radius, and the star afterwards re-expands and\n``anti-evaporates''. We clarify that the Israel junction conditions across the\nbrane (holographically related to the matter trace anomaly) and the projection\nof the Weyl tensor on the brane (holographically interpreted as the quantum\nback-reaction on the brane metric) contribute to the total energy as,\nrespectively, an ``anti-evaporation'' and an ``evaporation'' term. Concluding,\nwe comment on the possible effects of dissipation and obtain a new stringent\nbound for the brane tension. \n\n"}
