In this paper we consider the simplest geometry\npossible, a flat shell (or membrane) falling in the holographic direction\ntoward the horizon.

We define the problem as bulk\nEinstein's equations with Dirichlet boundary conditions on fixed timelike\ncut-off hypersurface. Using the fluid/gravity correspondence, we argue that one\ncan determine non-linear solutions to this problem in the long wavelength\nregime. On the boundary we find a conformal fluid with Dirichlet constitutive\nrelations, viz., the fluid propagates on a `dynamical' background metric which\ndepends on the local fluid velocities and temperature. This boundary fluid can\nbe re-expressed as an emergent hypersurface fluid which is non-conformal but\nhas the same value of the shear viscosity as the boundary fluid. The\nhypersurface dynamics arises as a collective effect, wherein effects of the\nbackground are transmuted into the fluid degrees of freedom. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate that this collective fluid is forced to be non-relativistic below a\ncritical cut-off radius in AdS to avoid acausal sound propagation with respect\nto the hypersurface metric. We further go on to show how one can use this\nset-up to embed the recent constructions of flat spacetime duals to\nnon-relativistic fluid dynamics into the AdS/CFT correspondence, arguing that a\nversion of the membrane paradigm arises naturally when the boundary fluid lives\non a background Galilean manifold. \n\n"}

In this\narticle we present an analysis of the dynamical (time dependent) nature of the\nNewtonian noise.

Such boundary conditions naturally arise from\nquantum cosmology with Hartle-Hawking wave function of the universe. The bounce\nhypersurface breaks de Sitter invariance and represents the beginning of the\nuniverse in this model. The second scenario, proposed by Carroll and Chen,\nassumes some generic initial conditions on an infinite spacelike Cauchy\nsurface.

We discuss decomposition of\nthe Hilbert space for the strong subadditivity and other related inequalities.\nThe entanglement entropy with centers can be computed from the Hamitonian\nformulations systematically, provided that we know wavefunctional. In the\nHamitonian formulation, it is easier to obtain symmetry structure. We consider\nmassless $p$-form theory as an example.

It has been argued that this is an\nanalogue for quantum processes in the presence of closed timelike curves\n(CTCs). The unusual properties of states of quantum communication networks that\nfulfill the D-CTC condition have been discussed extensively in recent\nliterature. In this work, the D-CTC condition is investigated in the framework\nof quantum field theory in the local, operator-algebraic approach due to Haag\nand Kastler. It is shown that the D-CTC condition cannot be fulfilled in states\nwhich are analytic for the energy, or satisfy the Reeh-Schlieder property, for\na certain class of processes and initial conditions. On the other hand, if a\nquantum field theory admits sufficiently many uncorrelated states across\nacausally related spacetime regions (as implied by the split property), then\nthe D-CTC condition can always be fulfilled approximately to arbitrary\nprecision. As this result pertains to quantum field theory on globally\nhyperbolic spacetimes where CTCs are absent, one may conclude that interpreting\nthe D-CTC condition as characteristic for quantum processes in the presence of\nCTCs could be misleading, and should be regarded with caution.

The baryon asymmetry is determined by\na competition between the helical hypermagnetic field, which sources baryon\nnumber, and the electroweak sphaleron, which tends to wash out baryon number.\nAt the electroweak crossover both of these processes become inactive; the\nhypermagnetic field is converted into an electromagnetic field, which does not\nsource baryon number, and the weak gauge boson masses grow, suppressing the\nelectroweak sphaleron reaction. An accurate prediction of the relic baryon\nasymmetry requires a careful treatment of the crossover. We extend our previous\nstudy [K. Kamada and A. J. Long, Phys. Rev.

The solution is based on a\nnonlinear generally covariant theory of a metastable graviton that leads to a\nlarge-distance modification of gravity.\n  From the extra-dimensional standpoint the problem is solved due to the fact\nthat the four-dimensional vacuum energy curves mostly the extra space. The\nfour-dimensional curvature is small, being inversely proportional to a positive\npower of the vacuum energy. The effects of infinite-volume extra dimensions are\nseen by a brane-world observer as nonlocal operators.\n  From the four-dimensional perspective the problem is solved because the\nzero-mode graviton is extremely weakly coupled to localized four-dimensional\nsources. The observable gravity is mediated not by zero mode but, instead, by a\nmetastable graviton with a lifetime of the order of the present-day Hubble\nscale. Therefore, laws of gravity are modified in the infrared above the Hubble\nscale. Large wave-length sources, such as the vacuum energy, feel only the\nzero-mode interaction and, as a result, curve space very mildly. Shorter\nwave-length sources interact predominantly via exchange of the metastable\ngraviton. Because of this, all standard properties of early cosmology,\nincluding inflation, are intact. \n\n"}

Feng et\nal. have suggested that, at high ambient de Sitter temperature, the rate may be\nstrongly enhanced, due to large degeneracy factors associated with the number\nof light species living on the worldsheet. This might facilitate the quick\nrelaxation from a large effective cosmological constant down to the observed\nvalue. Here, we analyse this possibility in some detail. In four dimensions,\nand after the moduli are stabilized, branes interact via repulsive long range\nforces. Because of that, the Coleman-de Luccia (CdL) instanton for coincident\nbrane nucleation may not exist, unless there is some short range interaction\nwhich keeps the branes together. If the CdL instanton exists, we find that the\ndegeneracy factor depends only mildly on the ambient de Sitter temperature, and\ndoes not switch off even in the case of tunneling from flat space. This would\nresult in catastrophic decay of the present vacuum. If, on the contrary, the\nCdL instanton does not exist, coindident brane nucleation may still proceed\nthrough a \"static\" instanton, representing pair creation of critical bubbles --\na process somewhat analogous to thermal activation in flat space. In that case,\nthe branes may stick together due to thermal symmetry restoration, and the pair\ncreation rate depends exponentially on the ambient de Sitter temperature,\nswitching off sharply as the temperature approaches zero.

In early studies of this model it was found that there is\na critical value of g^2, the square of the renormalized coupling constant,\nabove which g_0^2, the square of the unrenormalized coupling constant, is\nnegative. Thus, for g^2 larger than this critical value, the Hamiltonian of the\nLee model becomes non-Hermitian. It was also discovered that in this\nnon-Hermitian regime a new state appears whose norm is negative. This state is\ncalled a ghost state. It has always been assumed that in this ghost regime the\nLee model is an unacceptable quantum theory because unitarity appears to be\nviolated. However, in this regime while the Hamiltonian is not Hermitian, it\ndoes possess PT symmetry. It has recently been discovered that a non-Hermitian\nHamiltonian having PT symmetry may define a quantum theory that is unitary.

We find that the two-point function\ncomputed by using duality is different from that by doing a direct field theory\ncomputation.

Instead, the operator may\nbe merely symmetric. Such operators are not diagonalizable - and as a\nconsequence they describe real degrees of freedom which display a form of\n\"unsharpness\" or \"fuzzyness\". For example, there are indications that this type\nof operators could arise with the description of space-time at the string or at\nthe Planck scale, where some form of unsharpness or fuzzyness has long been\nconjectured.\n  A priori, however, a potential problem with merely symmetric operators is the\nfact that, unlike self-adjoint operators, they do not generate unitaries - at\nleast not straightforwardly.
