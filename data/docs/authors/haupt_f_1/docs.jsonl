This occurs at many conventional fixed points of NLSMs which are\nperturbatively accessible within the usual epsilon-expansion in d=2+\\epsilon\ndimensions. Since such operators are not prohibited from occurring in the\naction, they appear to threaten the very existence of such fixed points. At the\nsame time, for NLSMs describing metal-insulator transitions of Anderson\nlocalization in electronic conductors, the strong RG-relevance of these\noperators has been previously related to statistical properties of the\nconductance of samples of large finite size (\"conductance fluctuations\"). In\nthis paper, we analyze this question, not for perturbative RG treatments of\nNLSMs, but for 2d Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) models at level k, perturbatively in\nthe current-current interaction of the Noether current. WZW models are special\n(\"Principal Chiral\") NLSMs on a Lie Group G with a WZW term at level k.

The generation of a spin current is discussed by\ncalculating the thermal spin transfer torque, which breaks the spin\nconservation law for conduction electrons and operates the coherent magnon\nstate. Inhomogeneous thermal fluctuations between conduction electrons and\nmagnons induce a net spin current, which is pumped into the adjacent\nnon-magnetic metal. The pumped spin current is proportional to the temperature\ndifference. When the effective temperature of magnons is lower than that of\nconduction electrons, localized spins lose spin angular momentum by emitting\nmagnons and conduction electrons flip from down to up by absorbing all the\nemitted momentum, and vice versa. Magnons at the zero mode cannot contribute to\nthermal spin pumping because they are eliminated by the spin-flip condition.\nConsequently thermal spin pumping does not cost any kinds of applied magnetic\nfields.

Our system consists of a Fermi sea of spinless fermions\ninteracting with an impurity atom of different species which is confined by an\nisotropic potential. The interspecies attraction can be tuned with an $s$-wave\nFeshbach resonance so that the impurity atom and a spinless fermion form a\nbound dimer that occupies a threefold-degenerate $p$ orbital of the confinement\npotential. Many-body scatterings of this dimer and surrounding spinless\nfermions occur with exchanging their angular momenta and thus exhibit the SU(3)\norbital Kondo effect.

One of the transport\nsignatures of Majorana Kramers pairs is the quantized differential conductance\nof $4e^2/h$ when such a one-dimensional superconductor is coupled to a\nnormal-metal lead. The resonant Andreev reflection, responsible for this\nphenomenon, can be understood as the boundary condition change for lead\nelectrons at low energies. In this paper, we study the stability of the Andreev\nreflection fixed point with respect to electron-electron interactions in the\nLuttinger liquid. We first calculate the phase diagram for the Luttinger\nliquid-Majorana Kramers pair junction and show that its low-energy properties\nare determined by Andreev reflection scattering processes in the spin-triplet\nchannel, i.e. the corresponding Andreev boundary conditions are similar to that\nin a spin-triplet superconductor - normal lead junction. We also study here a\nquantum dot coupled to a normal lead and a Majorana Kramers pair and\ninvestigate the effect of local repulsive interactions leading to an interplay\nbetween Kondo and Majorana correlations. Using a combination of renormalization\ngroup analysis and slave-boson mean-field theory, we show that the system flows\nto a new fixed point which is controlled by the Majorana interaction rather\nthan the Kondo coupling. This Majorana fixed point is characterized by\ncorrelations between the localized spin and the fermion parity of each spin\nsector of the topological superconductor.

Central to this phenomenon are Hamiltonians whose insulating gap is\ncontrolled by a multi-dimensional (usually two-dimensional) parameter space in\nwhich paths can be defined for adiabatic changes in the Hamiltonian, i.e.,\nwithout closing the gap. Here, we extend the concept of Thouless pumps of band\ninsulators by considering a larger, three-dimensional parameter space. We show\nthat the connectivity of this parameter space is crucial for defining quantum\npumps, demonstrating that, as opposed to the conventional two-dimensional case,\npumped quantities depend not only on the initial and final points of\nHamiltonian evolution but also on the class of the chosen path and preserved\nsymmetries. As such, we distinguish the scenarios of closed/open paths of\nHamiltonian evolution, finding that different closed cycles can lead to the\npumping of different quantum numbers, and that different open paths may point\nto distinct scenarios for surface physics. As explicit examples, we consider\nmodels similar to simple models used to describe topological insulators, but\nwith doubled degrees of freedom compared to a minimal topological insulator\nmodel.

The adatoms are described by two tight-binding parameters: onsite\nenergy and hybridization strength. We explore a wide range of different\nmagnitudes of these parameters by employing T-matrix calculations in the single\nadatom limit and by tight-binding supercell calculations for dilute adatom\ncoverage. We calculate the density of states and the momentum relaxation rate\nand extract the resonance level and resonance width. Top position with large\nhybridization strength or, equivalently, small onsite energy, induces\nresonances close to zero energy. Bridge position, compared to top, is more\nsensitive to variation in the orbital tight-binding parameters. Resonances\nwithin the experimentally relevant energy window are found mainly for bridge\nadatoms with negative onsite energies. The effect of resonances from top and\nbridge position on the density of states and momentum relaxation rate is\ncomparable and both positions give rise to power-law decay of the resonant\nstate in graphene. Hollow position with $s$ orbital character is affected from\ndestructive interference which is seen from very narrow resonance peaks in the\ndensity of states and momentum relaxation rate. The resonant state shows no\nclear tendency to power-law decay around the impurity and its magnitude\ndecreases strongly with lowering the adatom content in the supercell\ncalculations. This is in contrast to top and bridge position. We conclude our\nstudy with a comparison to models of point-like vacancies and strong midgap\nscatterers. The latter model gives rise to significantly higher momentum\nrelaxation rates than caused by single adatoms. \n\n"}

To prove this, we examine the generic band topology of two\ndimensional real fermions in systems with space-time inversion $I_{ST}$\nsymmetry. The Euler class is an integer topological invariant classifying real\ntwo band systems.

Moreover, a two-band\nsystem with the Euler class $e_{2}$ has band crossing points whose total\nwinding number is equal to $-2e_2$. Thus the conventional Nielsen-Ninomiya\ntheorem fails in systems with a nonzero Euler class. We propose that the\ntopological phase transition between two insulators carrying distinct Euler\nclasses can be described in terms of the pair creation and annihilation of\nvortices accompanied by winding number changes across Dirac strings.

The system we tackle is thus made of one exciton plus\nzero or one FS electron-hole pair. At low doping, the system ground state is\npredominantly made of a \"trion-hole\"---a trion (two opposite-spin electrons\nplus a valence hole) weakly bound to a FS hole---with a small exciton\ncomponent. As the trion is poorly coupled to photon, the intensity of the\nlowest absorption peak is weak; it increases with doping, thanks to the growing\nexciton component, due to a larger coupling between 2-particle and 4-particle\nstates. Under a further doping increase, the trion-hole complex is less bound\nbecause of Pauli blocking by FS electrons, and its energy increases. The lower\npeak then becomes predominantly due to an exciton dressed by FS electron-hole\npairs, that is, an exciton-polaron.

Experimentally, a\nchannel-anisotropy can be introduced applying a relatively weak in-plane\nmagnetic field to the system when only one ``orbital'' channel is open. The\nmagnetic field leads to different transmission amplitudes for spin-up and\nspin-down electrons.\n  In a strong magnetic field the anisotropic two-channel limit corresponds to\ntwo (spin-polarized) orbital channels entering the dot.\n  The physics of the charge fluctuations can be captured using a mapping on the\nchannel-anisotropic two-channel Kondo model.

The Atiyah-Bott-Shapiro construction implies\nthat the low-energy modes near a Fermi surface exhibit relativistic invariance\nin the transverse p+1 dimensions.

We show how S-duality acts away from the IR fixed point. We develop a\nsystematic method to holographically obtain the deformations of the boundary\nCFT and show how electric-magnetic duality relates different deformations. We\nanalyze in detail marginal deformations and deformations by dimension 4\noperators. In the case of massive deformations, the RG flow relates S-dual\nCFT's. Correlation functions in the CFT are computed by varying magnetic bulk\nsources, whereas correlation functions in the dual CFT are computed by electric\nbulk sources. Under massive deformations, the boundary effective action is\ngenerically minimized by massive self-dual configurations of the U(1) gauge\nfield. We show that a self-dual choice of boundary conditions exists, and it\ncorresponds to the self-dual topologically massive gauge theory in 2+1\ndimensions. Thus, self-duality in three dimensions can be understood as a\nconsequence of electric-magnetic invariance in the bulk of AdS4. \n\n"}

This\nproblem is in certain ways very similar to the corresponding problem on the\ninfinite plane. Unlike the plane however, the group of symmetries of the\nmagnetic field, namely, rotations about the axis and the axial translations, is\n{\\em not} realized by the quantum electron but only a subgroup comprising\nrotations and discrete translations along the axial direction, is. The basic\nstep size of discrete translations is such that the flux through the `unit\ncylinder cell' is quantized in units of the flux quantum. The result is derived\nin two different ways: using the condition of projective realization of\nsymmetry groups and using the more familiar approach of determining the\nsymmetries of a given Hamiltonian. \n\n"}

It is shown that by using shaped pulses a CNOT gate can be\nobtained with a trace fidelity > 0.99999 for the two qubits, and even when\nincluding higher charge states, the leakage is below 1%. Yet, the required time\nis only a fifth of the pioneering experiment [T. Yamamoto et al., Nature 425\n(2003), 941] for otherwise identical parameters. The controls have palindromic\nsmooth time courses representable by superpositions of a few harmonics. We\noutline schemes to generate these shaped pulses such as simple network\nsynthesis. The approach is easy to generalise to larger systems as shown by a\nfast realisation of TOFFOLI's gate in three linearly coupled charge qubits.\nThus it is to be anticipated that this method will find wide application in\ncoherent quantum control of systems with finite degrees of freedom whose\ndynamics are Lie-algebraically closed. \n\n"}

A complementarity is\ndiscovered as the maximum fidelity is accompanied by a minimum of MMC. And at\nthe instant, which is just half of the characteristic time required to\naccomplish a perfect QST, the MMC can reach its maximum value one. A large\nclass of perfect QST models with a certain spectrum structure are discovered to\nsupport our analytical results. \n\n"}

The existing model\nof the process is clearly inadequate to its nature: all one-particle\n\"observables\" and \"tunneling times\", introduced as quantities to be common for\nthe sub-processes, cannot be experimentally measured and, consequently, have no\nphysical meaning; on the contrary, quantities introduced for either sub-process\nhave no basis, for the time evolution of either sub-process is unknown in this\nmodel. We show that the wave function to describe a completed scattering can be\nuniquely presented as the sum of two solutions to the Schr\\\"odinger equation,\nwhich describe separately the sub-processes at all stages of scattering. For\nsymmetric potential barriers such solutions are found explicitly. For either\nsub-process we define the time spent, on the average, by a particle in the\nbarrier region. We define it as the Larmor time. As it turned out, this time is\njust Buttiker's dwell time averaged over the corresponding localized state.\nThus, firstly, we justify the known definition of the local dwell time\nintroduced by Hauge and co-workers as well by Leavens and Aers, for now this\ntime can be measured; secondly, we confirm that namely Buttiker's dwell time\ngives the energy-distribution for the tunneling time; thirdly, we state that\nall the definitions are valid only if they are based on the wave functions for\ntransmission and reflection found in our paper. Besides, we define the exact\nand asymptotic group times to be auxiliary in timing the scattering process. \n\n"}
