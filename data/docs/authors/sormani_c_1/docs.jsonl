In that case we call the tensegrity\n\"bar equivalent\". In specific, they showed that if there exists a set of\npositive weights, called a positive \"stress\", on the edges such that the\nweighted sum of the edge vectors is zero at every vertex, then the tensegrity\nis bar equivalent.\n  In this paper we consider an extended version of the tensegrity framework in\nwhich the vertex set is a (possibly infinite) set of points in Euclidean\nn-space and the edgeset is a compact set of unordered pairs of vertices. These\nare called \"continuous tensegrities\". We show that if a continuous tensegrity\nhas a strictly positive stress, it is bar equivalent and that it has a\nsemipositive stress if and only if it is partially bar equivalent. We also show\nthat if a tensegrity is minimally bar equivalent (it is bar equivalent but\nremoving any open set of edges makes it no longer so), then it has a strictly\npositive stress.\n  In particular, we examine the case where the vertices form a rectifiable\ncurve and the possible motions of the curve are limited to local isometries of\nit.

The quasi-local mass is expected to be a type of flux integral on\nthe boundary two-surface and should be independent of whichever space-like\nregion it bounds. An important idea which is related to the Hamiltonian\nformulation of general relativity is to consider a reference surface in a flat\nambient space with the same first fundamental form and derive the quasi-local\nmass from the difference of the extrinsic geometries.

The wedge product construction can be described as an iterated\n``subdirect product'' as introduced by McMullen (1976); it is dual to the\n``wreath product'' construction of Joswig and Lutz (2005).\n  One particular instance of the wedge product construction turns out to be\nespecially interesting: The wedge products of polygons with simplices contain\ncertain combinatorially regular polyhedral surfaces as subcomplexes. These\ngeneralize known classes of surfaces ``of unusually large genus'' that first\nappeared in works by Coxeter (1937), Ringel (1956), and McMullen, Schulz, and\nWills (1983).

{"id": "1105.0201", "contents": "Title: On Singular Semi-Riemannian Manifolds Abstract: On a Riemannian or a semi-Riemannian manifold, the metric determines\ninvariants like the Levi-Civita connection and the Riemann curvature. If the\nmetric becomes degenerate (as in singular semi-Riemannian geometry), these\nconstructions no longer work, because they are based on the inverse of the\nmetric, and on related operations like the contraction between covariant\nindices. In this article we develop the geometry of singular semi-Riemannian\nmanifolds. First, we introduce an invariant and canonical contraction between\ncovariant indices, applicable even for degenerate metrics. This contraction\napplies to a special type of tensor fields, which are radical-annihilator in\nthe contracted indices. Then, we use this contraction and the Koszul form to\ndefine the covariant derivative for radical-annihilator indices of covariant\ntensor fields, on a class of singular semi-Riemannian manifolds named\nradical-stationary. We use this covariant derivative to construct the Riemann\ncurvature, and show that on a class of singular semi-Riemannian manifolds,\nnamed semi-regular, the Riemann curvature is smooth. We apply these results to\nconstruct a version of Einstein's tensor whose density of weight 2 remains\nsmooth even in the presence of semi-regular singularities. We can thus write a\ndensitized version of Einstein's equation, which is smooth, and which is\nequivalent to the standard Einstein equation if the metric is non-degenerate. \n\n"}

A particularly elegant realization of the associahedron, due to S.\nShnider and S. Sternberg and popularized by J.-L. Loday, has been generalized\nin two directions: on the one hand by A. Postnikov to obtain a realization of\nthe graph associahedra of M. Carr and S. Devadoss, and on the other hand by C.\nHohlweg and C. Lange to obtain multiple realizations of the associahedron\nparametrized by a sequence of signs. The goal of this paper is to unify and\nextend these two constructions to signed tree associahedra.\n  We define the notions of signed tubes and signed nested sets on a\nvertex-signed tree, generalizing the classical notions of tubes and nested sets\nfor unsigned trees. The resulting signed nested complexes are all simplicial\nspheres, but they are not necessarily isomorphic, even if they arise from\nsigned trees with the same underlying unsigned structure.

Quasi-local angular momentum and quasi-local center\nof mass correspond to pairing this element with rotation Killing fields and\nboost Killing fields, respectively. They obey classical transformation laws\nunder the action of the Poincar\\'e group. We further justify these definitions\nby considering their limits as the total angular momentum and the total center\nof mass of an isolated system. These expressions were derived from the\nHamilton-Jacobi analysis of gravitation action and thus satisfy conservation\nlaws.

In $3$-dimension, Shi-Tam's result is known to be\nequivalent to the Riemannian positive mass theorem.\n  In this paper, we provide a supplement to Shi-Tam's result by including the\neffect of minimal hypersurfaces on the boundary. More precisely, given a\ncompact manifold $\\Omega$ with nonnegative scalar curvature, assuming its\nboundary consists of two parts, $\\Sigma_h$ and $\\Sigma_o$, where $\\Sigma_h$ is\nthe union of all closed minimal hypersurfaces in $\\Omega$ and $\\Sigma_o$ is\nisometric to a suitable $2$-convex hypersurface $\\Sigma$ in a spatial\nSchwarzschild manifold of positive mass $m$, we establish an inequality\nrelating $m$, the area of $\\Sigma_h$, and two weighted total mean curvatures of\n$\\Sigma_o$ and $ \\Sigma$.

In this paper we make progress on\nreconciling these definitions. The source of discrepancies is two-fold: the\nchoice of boundary conditions (of which there are three variants) and the\nnon-degeneracy or \"no-horizon\" condition (at least six variants). To address\nthe boundary conditions, we show that given a 3-dimensional region $\\Omega$ of\nnonnegative scalar curvature ($R \\geq 0$) extended in a Lipschitz fashion\nacross $\\partial \\Omega$ to an asymptotically flat 3-manifold with $R \\geq 0$\n(also holding distributionally along $\\partial \\Omega$), there exists a\nsmoothing, arbitrarily small in $C^0$ norm, such that $R \\geq 0$ and the\ngeometry of $\\Omega$ are preserved, and the ADM mass changes only by a small\namount.
