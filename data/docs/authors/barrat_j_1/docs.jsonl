The two quenching schemes\nare called transverse and anisotropic quenching respectively. Our emphasis in\nthis paper is on the anisotropic quenching scheme and we compare the results\nwith those of the other scheme. In the process of anisotropic quenching, the\nsystem crosses all the quantum critical lines of the phase diagram where the\nrelaxation time diverges. The evolution is non-adiabatic in the time interval\nwhen the parameters are close to their critical values, and is adiabatic\notherwise. The density of defects produced due to non-adiabatic transitions is\ncalculated by mapping the many-particle system to an equivalent Landau-Zener\nproblem and is generally found to vary as $1/\\sqrt{\\tau}$, where $\\tau$ is the\ncharacteristic time scale of quenching, a scenario that supports the\nKibble-Zurek mechanism.

The idea is that\nif Fermi surface contours coincide when shifted along the observed CDW wave\nvector, then the CDW is considered to be nesting-derived. We show that in most\ncases this procedure has no predictive power, since Fermi surfaces either do\nnot nest at the right wave vector, or nest more strongly at the wrong vector.\nWe argue that only a tiny fraction, if any, of the observed charge ordering\nphase transitions are true analogues of the Peierls instability because\nelectronic instabilities are easily destroyed by even small deviations from\nperfect nesting conditions.

The stress\ndistribution of second order around the screw dislocation is classically known\nfor the hollow circular cylinder with traction-free external and internal\nboundaries. The inner boundary surrounds the dislocation's core, which is not\ncaptured by the conventional solution. The present gauge approach enables us to\ncontinue the classically known quadratic stresses inside the core. The gauge\nequation is chosen in the Hilbert--Einstein form, and it plays the role of\nnon-conventional incompatibility law. The stress function method is used, and\nit leads to the modified stress potential given by two constituents: the\nconventional one, say, the `background' and a short-ranged gauge contribution.\nThe latter just causes additional stresses, which are localized. The asymptotic\nproperties of the resulting stresses are studied. Since the gauge contributions\nare short-ranged, the background stress field dominates sufficiently far from\nthe core. The outer cylinder's boundary is traction-free. At sufficiently\nmoderate distances, the second order stresses acquire regular continuation\nwithin the core region, and the cut-off at the core does not occur. Expressions\nfor the asymptotically far stresses provide self-consistently new length scales\ndependent on the elastic parameters. These lengths could characterize an\nexteriority of the dislocation core region. \n\n"}

In graphene, where the charge carriers are chiral and have an\nadditional (Berry) phase of \\pi, the quantum interference is expected to lead\nto anti-localisation: an increase of the conductance accompanied by negative\nmagnetoconductance (a decrease of conductance in magnetic field).

Gibbs-Duhem\nequation thermodynamically limits the number of reservoirs to 2 for single\ncomponent systems. However, in conventional simulations utilizing 2 or fewer\nreservoirs, the system tends to be trapped in metastable states. Even if the\nsystem is allowed to escape from such metastable states in conventional\nsimulations, the fixed system size and/or the fixed number of particles result\nin creation of defects in ordered structures. This situation breaks global\nanisotropy of ordered structures and forces the periodicity of the structure to\nbe commensurate to the system size.

Excluded volume interactions due to chain stacking and spatial\ndistribution also has a bearing on the stress response. The bond length\ndistribution along the chain is not uniform. Rather, the bond lengths at the\nend of the chains are larger and uniformly decrease towards the middle of the\nchain from both ends. The effect is due to the presence of cross-linkers. As\nwith linear polymers, at high density values, changes in mean-square bond\nlength dominates over changes in radius of gyration and end-to-end length. That\nis, bond deformations dominate over changes in size and shape. A large change\nin the mean-square bond length reflects in a jump in the stress response.\nShort-chain polymers more or less behave like rigid molecules. Temperature has\na peculiar effect on the response in the sense that even though bond lengths\nincrease with temperature, stress response decreases with increasing\ntemperature. This is due to the dominance of excluded volume effects which\nresult in lower stresses at higher temperatures.

Our goal is to explore the impact of trap\nlocation on the efficiency of trapping in these two important polymer systems,\nwith the efficiency being measured by the average trapping time (ATT) that is\nthe average of source-to-trap mean first-passage time over every staring point\nin the whole networks. For Cayley trees, we derive an exact analytic formula\nfor the ATT to an arbitrary trap node, based on which we further obtain the\nexplicit expression of ATT for the case that the trap is uniformly distributed.\nFor Vicsek fractals, we provide the closed-form solution for ATT to a\nperipheral node farthest from the central node, as well as the numerical\nsolutions for the case when the trap is placed on other nodes. Moreover, we\nderive the exact formula for the ATT corresponding to the trapping problem when\nthe trap has an uniform distribution over all nodes. Our results show that the\ninfluence of trap location on the trapping efficiency is completely different\nfor the two polymer networks. In Cayley trees, the leading scaling of ATT\nincreases with the shortest distance between the trap and the central node,\nimplying that trap's position has an essential impact on the trapping\nefficiency; while in Vicsek fractals, the effect of location of the trap is\nnegligible, since the dominant behavior of ATT is identical, respective of the\nlocation where the trap is placed.

These states are\nseparated by first-order phase transitions between them. In both gas and liquid\nphases the complete translational and rotational symmetry exist, whereas in a\nsolid phase both symmetries are broken. In intermediate phases between liquid\nand solid, which include liquid crystal and plastic crystal phases, only one of\nthe two symmetries is preserved. Among the fundamental states of matter, the\nliquid state is most poorly understood. We argue that it is crucial for a\nbetter understanding of liquid to recognize that a liquid generally has a\ntendency to have local structural order and its presence is intrinsic and\nuniversal to any liquid. Such structural ordering is a consequence of many body\ncorrelations, more specifically, bond angle correlations, which we believe are\ncrucial for the description of the liquid state. We show that this physical\npicture may naturally explain difficult unsolved problems associated with the\nliquid state, such as anomalies of water-type liquids (water, Si, Ge, ...),\nliquid-liquid transition, liquid-glass transition, crystallization and\nquasicrystal formation, in a unified manner.

Each micro-junction\ncan switch in time between two states: A pinned state characterized by a\ndisplacement-dependent force, and a slipping state characterized by a\ntime-dependent force. Instead of tracking each micro-junction individually, the\nstate of the interface is described by two coupled distributions for (i) the\nstretching of pinned junctions and (ii) the time spent in the slipping state.\nWe show how this framework represents an overarching structure for important\nmodels existing in the friction literature.

Recent studies of systems with randomly pinned particles have\nhinted that the thermodynamic glass transition may be observed in simulations\nand experiments carried out for liquids with randomly pinned particles. This\nexpectation is based on the results of approximate calculations that suggest\nthat the temperature of the thermodynamic glass transition increases as the\nconcentration of pinned particles is increased and it may be possible to\nequilibrate the system at temperatures near the increased transition\ntemperature.

Among\nthem, shear bands are ubiquitous in a wide variety of materials, ranging from\nsoft matter systems to metallic alloys. Shear banding is associated with strain\nlocalization, i.e. the deformation of the sheared glassy solid is localized in\nspace in form of band-like structures. These structures are often precursors to\ncatastrophic failure, implying that a proper understanding of the underlying\nmechanisms could lead to the design of smarter materials.

Without random field disorders (RFD), only one of the PDW\ncomponents survives. If the RFD is included, this state could become phase\nseparated and consist of short range PDW stripes, in which two PDW components\ncoexist but differ in magnitudes, resulting in charge density waves (CDW) and a\ntime-reversal symmetry breaking order, in the form of loop current, as\nsecondary composite orders. We call this phase-separated pair nematic (PSPN)\nstate, which could be responsible for the pseudogap. Using a phenomenological\nGinzburg-Landau approach and Monte Carlo simulations, we found that in this\nstate, RFD induces short range static CDW with phase-separated patterns in the\ndirectional components and the static CDW is destroyed by thermal phase\nfluctuations at a crossover temperature $T_{CO}<T^{*}$, above which the CDW\nbecomes dynamically fluctuating.

It is the\nfundamental mechanism by which biological materials grow, starting from the\nlevel of a single cell, and is increasingly applied in engineering processes\nfor fabrication and self-assembly. A significant complexity in describing the\nkinetics of such processes arises due to their inherent coupled interaction\nwith the diffusing constituents that are needed to sustain the growth, and the\ninfluence of local stresses on the growth rates. Moreover, changes in\nconcentration of solvent within the bulk of the body, generated by diffusion,\ncan affect volumetric changes, thus leading to an additional interacting growth\nmechanism.

Understanding the high-harmonic response of few-layer\nsemiconducting systems is important, and might open up possible technological\napplications.

However in an\nexperimental realization of such a system, spurious interactions may cause the\nedge zero modes to delocalize. To stabilize against this influence beyond\nsimply increasing the bulk gap, it has been proposed to harness suitable\nnotions of disorder. Equipped with numerical tools for constructing locally\nconserved operators that we introduce, we comprehensively explore the interplay\nof local interactions and disorder on localized edge modes in the XZX cluster\nHamiltonian. This puts us in a position to challenge the narrative that\ndisorder necessarily stabilizes topological order. Contrary to heuristic\nreasoning, we find that disorder has no effect on the edge modes in the\nAnderson localized regime. Moreover, disorder helps localize only a subset of\nedge modes in the many-body interacting regime. We identify one edge mode\noperator that behaves as if subjected to a non-interacting perturbation, i.e.,\nshows no disorder dependence. This implies that in finite systems, edge mode\noperators effectively delocalize at distinct interaction strengths. In essence,\nour findings suggest that the ability to identify and control the best\nlocalized edge mode trumps any gains from introducing disorder. \n\n"}

The interchain and the\nintrachain interaction constant are denoted by $J_{rung}$ and $J_{\\rm leg}$,\nrespectively and assumed to be antiferromagnetic.

It was recently shown that conventional\nmean field nucleation theory overestimates the rate of second layer nucleation\nby a factor that is proportional to the number of times a given site is visited\nby an adatom during its residence time on the island. In the presence of strong\nstep edge barriers this factor can be large, leading to a substantial error in\nprevious attempts to experimentally determine barrier energies from the onset\nof second layer nucleation.

The superfluid transition in aerogel at 33.4\nbars is field independent from 0 to 5 kG and shows no evidence of an\n$A_{1}-A_{2}$ splitting. The first-order transition between the A and B-phases\nis suppressed by a magnetic field, and exhibits strong supercooling at high\npressures. We show that the equilibrium phase in zero applied field is the\nB-phase with at most a region of A-phase {\\small $\\alt$} 20 $\\mu$K just below\nT${_c}$ at a pressure of 33.4 bars. This is in contrast to pure $^{3}$He which\nhas a large stable region of A-phase and a polycritical point. The quadratic\ncoefficient for magnetic field suppression of the AB-transition,\n$g_{a}(\\beta)$, was obtained. The pressure dependence of $g_{a}(\\beta)$ is\nmarkedly different from that for the pure superfluid, $g_{0}(\\beta)$, which\ndiverges at a polycritical pressure of 21 bars.

Using\nsingle particle trajectories we define a jump by comparing for each particle\nits fluctuations with its changes in average position. We find two kinds of\njumps: \"reversible jumps,\" where a particle jumps back and forth between two or\nmore average positions, and \"irreversible jumps,\" where a particle does not\nreturn to any of its former average positions. For all investigated\ntemperatures both kinds of particles jump and both irreversible and reversible\njumps occur. With increasing temperature relaxation is enhanced by an\nincreasing number of jumps, and growing jump lengths in position and potential\nenergy. However, the waiting time between two successive jumps is independent\nof temperature. This temperature independence might be due to aging, which is\npresent in our system.

We find\na remarkably rich variety of dynamical locking phenomena as we vary the angle\nof the applied drive with respect to the orientation of the colloidal lattice.\nWhen the driven colloid locks to certain lattice symmetry directions, its\nmotion is not necessarily aligned with the drive. Applying a transverse force\nto the driven particle can result in either increased or decreased drag in the\ndriving direction, depending on the angle of the drive. The dynamical locking\nproduces anomalies in both the longitudinal and the transverse velocity vs\ndriving force curves, including steps and regimes of negative differential\nresistance. As the interaction of the driven particle with the surrounding\nlattice increases, significant distortion or dislocations in the surrounding\nmedia occur, and as a result the directional locking is enhanced.

The basic assumption is that the {\\it\ncomputational} system dynamics can be decomposed into two parts -- fast (noise)\nand slow (reaction coordinates) dynamics, so that the system can be described\nby an effective, coarse grained Fokker-Planck (FP) equation. While such an\nassumption may be valid in many circumstances, an explicit form of FP equation\nis not always available. In our computations we bypass the analytic derivation\nof such an effective FP equation. The effective free energy gradient and the\nstate-dependent magnitude of the random noise, which are necessary to formulate\nthe effective Fokker-Planck equation, are obtained from ensembles of short\nbursts of microscopic simulations {\\it with judiciously chosen initial\nconditions}.

This is a low energy state obtained by a sequence of slow\nmagnetic field oscillations with decreasing amplitude. The main concern is how\noptimized the demagnetized state is with respect to the best-possible ground\nstate.

As a consequence, accurate results can be obtained using\nvalues of W much larger than the physical interface thickness, which makes\nsimulations for realistic experimental parameters feasible. Convergence of the\nsimulation outcome with decreasing W is explicitly demonstrated. The results\nare also compared to a boundary-integral formulation of the corresponding\nfree-boundary problem. Excellent agreement is found, except in the immediate\nvicinity of bifurcation points, where differences arise. These differences\nreveal that, in contrast to the standard assumptions of the free-boundary\nproblem, out of equilibrium the diffuse trijunction region of the phase-field\nmodel can (i) slightly deviate from Young's law for the contact angles, and\n(ii) advance in a direction that forms a finite angle with the solid-solid\ninterface at each instant. While the deviation (i) extrapolates to zero in the\nlimit of vanishing interface thickness, the small angle in (ii) remains roughly\nconstant, which indicates that it might be a genuine physical effect, present\neven for an atomic-scale interface thickness. \n\n"}

Instead of relying on externally-induced flow or probe motion, we\nsuggest that colloidal diffusivity near solid surfaces contains signatures of\nthe degree of fluid slip exhibited on those surfaces. To investigate, we\ncalculate the image system for point forces (Stokeslets) oriented perpendicular\nand parallel to a surface with a finite slip length, analogous to Blake's\nsolution for a Stokeslet near a no-slip wall. Notably, the image system for the\npoint source and perpendicular Stokeslet contain the same singularities as\nBlake's solution; however, each is distributed along a line with a magnitude\nthat decays exponentially over the slip length.

In a small system, the size limits the scale of\nthe fluctuations and makes it imperative for us to understand how the response\nof the system is altered in such a situation. In this thesis, this question is\nanswered for the special case of interfacial fluctuations in two dimensions\n(2d). The energy of an interface between two phases in equilibrium is invariant\nwith respect to translations perpendicular to the plane (or line in 2d) of the\ninterface.

As an exception Skyrme's model succeeded to\ndescribe nuclear particles as localized states, so-called 'skyrmions', within a\nnon-linear field theory. Skyrmions are a characteristic of non-linear continuum\nmodels ranging from microscopic to cosmological scales. Skyrmionic states have\nbeen found under non-equilibrium conditions, or when stabilised by external\nfields or the proliferation of topological defects. Examples are Turing\npatterns in classical liquids, spin textures in quantum Hall magnets, or the\nblue phases in liquid crystals, respectively. However, it is believed that\nskyrmions cannot form spontaneous ground states like ferromagnetic or\nantiferromagnetic order in magnetic materials.

The first part of the paper\nconcerns the applications of methods used in classical differential geometry to\nstudy the chaotic dynamics of Hamiltonian systems. Starting from the identity\nbetween the trajectories of a dynamical system and the geodesics in its\nconfiguration space, a geometric theory of chaotic dynamics can be developed,\nwhich sheds new light on the origin of chaos in Hamiltonian systems. In fact,\nit appears that chaos can be induced not only by negative curvatures, as was\noriginally surmised, but also by positive curvatures, provided the curvatures\nare fluctuating along the geodesics. In the case of a system with a large\nnumber of degrees of freedom it is possible to give an analytical estimate of\nthe largest Lyapunov exponent by means of a geometric model independent of the\ndynamics. In the second part of the paper the phenomenon of phase transitions\nis addressed and it is here that topology comes into play. In fact, when a\nsystem undergoes a phase transition, the fluctuations of the\nconfiguration-space curvature exhibit a singular behavior at the phase\ntransition point, which can be qualitatively reproduced using geometric models.\nIn these models the origin of the singular behavior of the curvature\nfluctuations appears to be caused by a topological transition in configuration\nspace. This leads us to put forward a Topological Hypothesis (TH).
