The galaxy is known to possess a dramatic 70 kpc\nX-ray tail. The detected H-alpha tail coincides positionally with the X-ray\ntail. The H-alpha emission in the galaxy is sharply truncated on the front and\nthe sides near the nucleus, indicating significant ram pressure stripping. ESO\n137-001 is thus the first cluster late-type galaxy known unambiguously with\nboth an X-ray tail and an H-alpha tail. The emission-line objects are all\ndistributed downstream of the galaxy, with projected distance up to 39 kpc from\nthe galaxy. From the analysis on the H-alpha_{off} frame and the estimate of\nthe background emission-line objects, we conclude that it is very likely all 29\nemission-line objects are HII regions in A3627.

Abstract: The evolution of the galaxy stellar mass--star formation rate relationship\n(M*-SFR) provides key constraints on the stellar mass assembly histories of\ngalaxies. For star-forming galaxies, M*-SFR is observed to be fairly tight with\na slope close to unity from z~0-2. Simulations of galaxy formation reproduce\nthese trends owing to the generic dominance of smooth and steady cold accretion\nin these systems. In contrast, the amplitude of the M*-SFR relation evolves\nmarkedly differently than in models. Stated in terms of a star formation\nactivity parameter alpha=(M*/SFR)/(t_H-1 Gyr), models predict a constant\nalpha~1 out to redshifts z=4+, while the observed M*-SFR relation indicates\nthat alpha increases by X3 from z~2 until today. The low alpha at high-z not\nonly conflicts with models, but is also difficult to reconcile with other\nobservations of high-z galaxies. Systematic biases could significantly affect\nmeasurements of M* and SFR, but detailed considerations suggest that none are\nobvious candidates to reconcile the discrepancy. A speculative solution is\nconsidered in which the stellar initial mass function (IMF) evolves towards\nmore high-mass star formation at earlier epochs.

We highlight\nprocesses that could affect the WD shear, during accretion as well as during\nthe ~1000 years of pre-explosive simmering. Baroclinic instabilities and/or the\nshear growth of small magnetic fields provide sufficient torque to bring the WD\nvery close to solid body rotation during accretion. The lack of significant\nshear makes it difficult to grow a WD substantially past the typical\nChandrasekhar mass. Once carbon ignites, a convective region spreads from the\nWD's center.

The potential is derived from an N-body calculation and leads to a\nmulti-armed time-evolving pattern. The gas forms long spiral arms typical of\ngrand design galaxies, although the spiral pattern is asymmetric. The primary\ndifference from a grand-design spiral galaxy, which has a consistent 2/4-armed\npattern, is that instead of passing through the spiral arms, gas generally\nfalls into a developing potential minimum and is released only when the local\nminimum dissolves. In this case, the densest gas is coincident with the spiral\npotential, rather than offset as in the grand-design spirals. We would there\nfore expect no offset between the spiral shock and star formation, and no\nobvious co-rotation radius. Spurs which occur in grand-design spirals when\nlarge clumps are sheared off leaving the spiral arms, are rare in the active,\ntime-evolving spiral reported here.

In particular, the arm-\nand looplike morphologies of the observed tidal debris can only be produced by\nthe kinematically cold material of the disk components of the accreted\ngalaxies. The tidal features that arise from such \"cold-accretion\" events onto\na massive elliptical are visible for significantly longer timescales than the\nfeatures produced by elliptical-elliptical mergers (about 1-2 Gyr vs. a few\nhundred million years). Mass ratios of the order of 1:10 between the accreting\nelliptical and the accreted disk are sufficient to match the brightness of the\nobserved debris.

Over this\nredshift range, we find significant increases (factors of ~5--10) in the\nX-ray--to--optical mean luminosity ratio (L_X/L_B) and the\nX-ray--to--stellar-mass mean ratio (L_X/M*) for galaxy populations selected by\nL_B and M*, respectively. When analyzing galaxy samples selected via SFR, we\nfind that the mean X-ray--to--SFR ratio (L_X/SFR) is consistent with being\nconstant over the entire redshift range for galaxies with SFR = 1--100 Msol\nyr^-1, thus demonstrating that X-ray emission can be used as a robust indicator\nof star-formation activity out to z = 1.4. We find that the star-formation\nactivity (as traced by X-ray luminosity) per unit stellar mass in a given\nredshift bin increases with decreasing stellar mass over the redshift range z =\n0.2--1, which is consistent with previous studies of how star-formation\nactivity depends on stellar mass. Finally, we extend our X-ray analyses to\nLyman break galaxies at z ~ 3 and estimate that L_X/L_B at z ~ 3 is similar to\nits value at z = 1.4. \n\n"}

Notably GMCs formed primarily by\nagglomeration tend to be unbound associations of many smaller clouds, which\ndisperse upon leaving the spiral arms.

With the recent availability of large-scale\nmulti-epoch photometric datasets we were able to study eclipsing binary stars\nen masse. In this thesis, we analyzed 185,445 light curves from ten TrES\nfields, and 218,699 light curves from the OGLE II bulge fields. In order to\nmanage such large quantities of data, we developed a pipeline with which we\nsystematically identified eclipsing binaries, solved for their geometric\norientations, and then found their components' absolute properties. Following\nthis analysis we assembled catalogs of eclipsing binaries with their models,\ncomputed statistical distributions of their properties, and located rare cases\nfor further follow-up, including T-Cyg1-03378, which has unusual eclipse timing\nvariations. Of particular importance are low-mass eclipsing binaries, which are\nrare yet critical for resolving the ongoing mass-radius discrepancy between\ntheoretical models and observations. To this end, we have discovered over a\ndozen new low-mass eclipsing binary candidates and spectroscopically confirmed\nthe masses of five of them. One of these confirmed candidates, T-Lyr1-17236, is\nespecially interesting because of its long orbital period. We examined\nT-Lyr1-17236 in detail and found that it is consistent with the magnetic\ndisruption hypothesis. Both the source code of our pipeline and the complete\nlist of our candidates are freely available. \n\n"}

When extraction of the black\nhole spin energy powers an outflow from the hole, the ratio r provides an\nindication of the black hole spin.

A sample of 29 central dominant galaxies is also studied; most of\nthese sources have amorphous or FRI radio structure.

In the accretion model the secondary star accretes mass\nfrom the primary wind near periastron passage, a process that suppresses the\nsecondary wind. As the shocked secondary wind is responsible for most of the\nX-ray emission, the accretion process accounts for the X-ray minimum.

We suggest a new interpretation of these\nobservations, which is consistent with both the EBL calculations and the AGN\nmodels. Cosmic rays with energies below 50 EeV, produced by AGN, can cross\ncosmological distances, interact with EBL relatively close to Earth, and\ngenerate the secondary photons observed by gamma-ray telescopes. We calculate\nthe spectrum of the secondary photons and find that it agrees with the\ngamma-ray data.

During the middle stage, many systems with superhump\nperiods less than 0.08 d show positive period derivatives. Contrary to the\nearlier claim, we found no clear evidence for variation of period derivatives\nbetween superoutburst of the same object. We present an interpretation that the\nlengthening of the superhump period is a result of outward propagation of the\neccentricity wave and is limited by the radius near the tidal truncation.

Recently it has been suggested that the two major radio AGN\npopulations -- the powerful high-excitation, and the weak low-excitation radio\nAGN (HERAGN and LERAGN, resp.) -- represent two earlier and later stages of\nmassive galaxy build-up. To test this, here we make use of a local (0.04<z<0.1)\nsample of ~500 radio AGN with available optical spectroscopy, drawn from the\nFIRST, NVSS, SDSS, and 3CRR surveys. A clear dichotomy is found between the\nproperties of low-excitation (absorption line AGN, and LINERs) and\nhigh-excitation (Seyferts) radio AGN. The hosts of the first have the highest\nstellar masses, reddest optical colors, and highest mass black holes but\naccrete inefficiently (at low rates). On the other hand, the high-excitation\nradio AGN have lower stellar masses, bluer optical colors (consistent with the\n`green valley'), and lower mass black holes that accrete efficiently (at high\nrates). Such properties can be explained if these two radio AGN populations\nrepresent different stages in the formation of massive galaxies, and thus are\nalso linked to different phases of the `AGN feedback'. \n\n"}

While the former has been widely\nexplored, the effects of eta-quenching in the magnetic field evolution have\nrarely been considered. In this work we investigate the role of the suppression\nof diffusivity in a flux-transport solar dynamo model that also includes a\nnon-linear alpha-quenching term. Our results indicate that, although for\nalpha-quenching the dependence of the magnetic field amplification with the\nquenching factor is nearly linear, the magnetic field response to eta-quenching\nis non-linear and spatially non-uniform. We have found that the magnetic field\ncan be locally amplified in this case, forming long-lived structures whose\nmaximum amplitude can be up to ~2.5 times larger at the tachocline and up to ~2\ntimes larger at the center of the convection zone than in models without\nquenching. However, this amplification leads to unobservable effects and to a\nworse distribution of the magnetic field in the butterfly diagram. Since the\ndynamo cycle period increases when the efficiency of the quenching increases,\nwe have also explored whether the eta-quenching can cause a diffusion-dominated\nmodel to drift into an advection-dominated regime. We have found that models\nundergoing a large suppression of the diffusivity produce a strong segregation\nof magnetic fields that may lead to unsteady dynamo-oscillations. On the other\nhand, an initially diffusion-dominated model undergoing a small suppression in\neta remains in the diffusion-dominated regime. \n\n"}

A recent Chandra observation has revealed the\npresence of a compact cool corona associated with the BCG, solving the puzzle\nof the apparent lack of low entropy gas surrounding a bright radio source, but\nopening the question of its origin. NGC 5044 shows in the inner 10 kpc a pair\nof cavities together with a set of bright filaments.

This paper looks at the\neffect of large planetesimal eccentricities (e>>0.3) on their collisional\nlifetime and the amount of mass that can remain at late times M_{late}. For an\naxisymmetric planetesimal disk with common pericentres and eccentricities e, we\nfind that M_{late} \\propto e^{-5/3}(1+e)^{4/3}(1-e)^{-3}. For a scattered\ndisk-like population (i.e., common pericentres), in the absence of dynamical\nevolution, the mass evolution at late times would be as if only planetesimals\nwith the largest eccentricity were present. Despite the increased remaining\nmass, higher eccentricities do not increase the hot emission from the\ncollisional cascade until e>0.99, partly because most collisions occur near\npericentre thus increasing the dust blow-out diameter. However, at high\neccentricities (e>0.97) the blow-out population extending out from pericentre\nmay be detectable above the collisional cascade; higher eccentricities also\nincrease the probability of witnessing a recent collision. All of the imaging\nand spectroscopic constraints for eta Corvi can be explained with a single\nplanetesimal population with pericentre at 0.75AU, apocentre at 150AU, and mass\n5M_\\oplus; however, the origin of such a high eccentricity population remains\nchallenging. The mid-IR excess to HD69830 can be explained by the ongoing\ndestruction of a debris belt produced in a recent collision in an eccentric\nplanetesimal belt, but the lack of far-IR emission requires small bound grains\nto be absent from the parent planetesimal belt, possibly due to sublimation. \n\n"}

Furthermore,\ninstead of forming dilute halos around the remnant as in the case of NS\nmergers, the coalescence of SSs results in a differentially rotating\nhypermassive object with a sharp surface layer surrounded by a geometrically\nthin, clumpy high-density SQM disk. We also investigate the importance of\nincluding non-zero temperature equations of state (EoSs) in NS and SS merger\nsimulations. In both cases we find a crucial sensitivity of the dynamics and\noutcome of the coalescence to thermal effects, which, e.g., determine the outer\nremnant structure and the delay time of the dense remnant core to black hole\ncollapse. For comparing and classifying the GW signals, we use a number of\ncharacteristic quantities like the maximum frequency during inspiral or the\ndominant frequency of oscillations of the postmerger remnant. In general, these\nfrequencies are higher for SS mergers. If not, additional features of the GW\nluminosity spectrum may help to discriminate coalescence events of the\ndifferent types.

{"id": "1009.3962", "contents": "Title: Molecular Cloud Evolution Abstract: I describe the scenario of molecular cloud (MC) evolution that has emerged\nover the past decade or so. MCs can start out as cold atomic clouds formed by\ncompressive motions in the warm neutral medium (WNM) of galaxies. Such motions\ncan be driven by large-scale instabilities, or by local turbulence. The\ncompressions induce a phase transition to the cold neutral medium (CNM) to form\ngrowing cold atomic clouds, which in their early stages may constitute thin CNM\nsheets. Several dynamical instabilities soon destabilize a cloud, rendering it\nturbulent. For solar neighborhood conditions, a cloud is coincidentally\nexpected to become molecular, magnetically supercritical, and gravitationally\ndominated at roughly the same column density, $N \\sim 1.5 \\times 10^21 \\psc\n\\approx 10 \\Msun$ pc$^{-2}$. At this point, the cloud begins to contract\ngravitationally. However, before its global collapse is completed ($\\sim 10^7$\nyr later), the nonlinear density fluctuations within the cloud, which have\nshorter local free-fall times, collapse first and begin forming stars, a few\nMyr after the global contraction started. Large-scale fluctuations of lower\nmean densities collapse later, so the formation of massive star-forming regions\nis expected to occur late in the evolution of a large cloud complex, while\nscattered low-mass regions are expected to form earlier. Eventually, the local\nstar formation episodes are terminated by stellar feedback, which disperses the\nlocal dense gas, although more work is necessary to clarify the details and\ncharacteristic scales of this process. \n\n"}

However, in the inhomogeneous universe, even if\n<\\delta\\rho> =0, the distance relation is not the same as in the unperturbed\nuniverse. This can be of serious consequences as a change of distance affects\nthe mapping of CMB temperature fluctuations into the angular power spectrum. In\naddition, if the change of distance is relatively uniform no new temperature\nfluctuations are generated. It is therefore a different effect than the lensing\nor ISW effects which introduce additional CMB anisotropies.

Since this effect\nhas not been fully explored before, to test how the inhomogeneities affect the\ndistance-redshift relation, several methods are examined: the Dyer-Roeder\nrelation, lensing approximation, and non-linear Swiss-Cheese model. In all\ncases, the distance to the last scattering surface is different than when\nhomogeneity is assumed.

Taking this advantage, we found that DECIGO/BBO can actually\nmeasure $\\ell$ down to $\\ell=0.33 \\mu$m for 5 year observation if we know that\nbinaries are circular a priori. This is about 40 times smaller than the upper\nbound obtained from the table-top experiment. On the other hand, when we take\neccentricities into binary parameters, the detection limit weakens to $\\ell=1.5\n\\mu$m due to strong degeneracies between $\\ell$ and eccentricities. We also\nderived the upper bound on $\\ell$ from the expected detection number of extreme\nmass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) with LISA and BH/NS binaries with DECIGO/BBO,\nextending the discussion made recently by McWilliams.

We provide an interpretation of the formation of these\nbinaries that explains the total number formed and their distribution of\nenergies. A population of weakly bound binaries can always be found in the\ncluster, in accordance with statistical detailed balance, limited at the soft\nend only by the current size of the cluster and whatever observational criteria\nare imposed. At any given time, the observed soft binary distribution is\npredominantly a snapshot of a transient population.

The total number of wide binaries that form, and their\nenergy distribution, are insensitive to the cluster population; the number is\napproximately one per cluster. This suggests that a population composed of many\ndissolved small-N clusters will more efficiently populate the field with wide\nbinaries than that composed of dissolved large-N clusters.

We quantify the deep connection between the solution space of\nsteady-state accretion flows with bounding shocks and the neutrino mechanism.\nWe show that there is a maximum, critical sound speed above which it is\nimpossible to maintain accretion with a standoff shock, because the shock jump\nconditions cannot be satisfied. The physics of this critical sound speed is\ngeneral and does not depend on a specific heating mechanism. For the simple\nmodel of pressure-less free-fall onto a shock bounding an isothermal accretion\nflow with sound speed c_T, we show that if c_T^2/v_escape^2 > 3/16 explosion\nresults. We generalize this result to the more complete supernova problem,\nshowing explicitly that the same physics determines L_crit.

As\nin previous work, we find that L_crit is always significantly higher than the\nmaximum possible value of L_acc.

First, we\nfind that, because of dust destruction due to both reverse and forward shocks\ndriven by SNe, H$_{2}$ formation is more suppressed than that without dust\ndestruction.

We can directly observe and test for isotropy, but to\nlink this to homogeneity, we need to assume the Copernican Principle.

Second, we discuss what we can say with the\nCopernican assumption. The most powerful result is based on the CMB: the\nvanishing of the dipole, quadrupole and octupole of the CMB is sufficient to\nimpose homogeneity.

These morphological disturbances\nare related to the ram-pressure stripping and tidal interaction that galaxies\nundergo in this dense cluster environment. To quantify the morphological\ntransformation of the HI disks, we compute the morphological parameters of CAS,\nGini, and M20 and our own GM for 51 galaxies in 48 HI column density maps from\nthe VIVA project. Some morphological phenomena can be identified in this space\nof relatively low resolution HI data. Truncation of the HI disk can be cleanly\nidentified via the Concentration parameter (C<1) and Concentration can also be\nused to identify HI deficient disks (1<C<5). Tidal interaction is typically\nidentified using combinations of these morphological parameters, applied to\n(optical) images of galaxies. We find that some selection criteria (Gini-M20,\nAsymmetry, and a modified Concentration-M20) are still applicable for the\ncoarse (~15\" FWHM) VIVA HI data.

Among other things, it was proposed as a potentially viable\nexplanation of a part of the Pioneer anomaly. We study the impact that an\nanomalous Rindler-type term as large as |A_Rin| \\sim 10^-10 m s^-2 may have on\nthe the orbital dynamics of a typical object of the Oort cloud whose\nself-energy is quite smaller than its putative Rindler energy. By taking a\ntypical comet moving along a highly eccentric and inclined orbit throughout the\nexpected entire extension of the Oort cloud (0.02 pc-1 pc), it turns out that\nthe addition of an outward Rindler-like acceleration, i.e. for A_Rin > 0, does\nnot allow bound orbits. Instead, if A_Rin < 0, the resulting numerically\nintegrated trajectory is limited in space, but it radically differs from the\nstandard Keplerian ellipse. In particular, the heliocentric distance of the\ncomet gets markedly reduced and experiences high frequency oscillations, its\nspeed is increased, and the overall pattern of the trajectory is quite\nisotropic. As a consequence, the standard picture of the Oort cloud is\nradically altered since its modified orbits are much less sensitive to the\ndisturbing actions of the Galactic tide and nearby passing stars whose effects,\nin the standard scenario, are responsible for the phenomenology on which our\nconfidence in the existence of the cloud itself is based.

In this\ncase, matter at a single redshift dominates the lensing signal, so the analysis\nis straightforward.

At a chosen time the emergence is stopped with the\nlower boundary taken to be rigid. Then the coronal flux rope settles into a\nquasi-static rise phase during which an underlying, central sigmoid-shaped\ncurrent layer forms along the so called hyperbolic flux tube (HFT), a\ngeneralization of the X-line configuration. Reconnections in the dissipating\ncurrent layer effectively add twisted flux to the flux rope and thus allow it\nto rise quasi-statically, even though the magnetic energy is decreasing as the\nsystem relaxes. We examine the thermal features produced by the current layer\nformation and the associated \"tether-cutting\" reconnections as a result of\nheating and field aligned thermal conduction. It is found that a central hot,\nlow-density channel containing reconnected, twisted flux threading under the\nflux rope axis forms on top of the central current layer.

Uniting all this observational data into one coherent picture to\nbetter understand planet formation is an important, but difficult undertaking.\nOur approach is to develop a model which can make testable predictions for all\nthese observational methods.

We also improve the protoplanetary disk model. Finally, we\nconduct population synthesis calculations. We present how the planetary\nmass-radius relationship of planets with primordial H/He envelopes forms and\nevolves in time. The basic shape of the M-R relation can be understood from the\ncore accretion model. Low-mass planets cannot bind massive envelopes, while\nsuper-critical cores necessarily trigger runway gas accretion, leading to\n\"forbidden\" zones in the M-R plane. For a given mass, there is a considerable\ndiversity of radii. We compare the synthetic M-R relation with the observed\none, finding good agreement for a>0.1 AU. The synthetic radius distribution is\ncharacterized by a strong increase towards small R, and a second, lower local\nmaximum at ~1 Jovian radius. The increase towards small radii reflects the\nincrease of the mass function towards low M. The second local maximum is due to\nthe fact that radii are nearly independent of mass for giant planets. A\ncomparison of the synthetic radius distribution with Kepler data shows\nagreement for R>2 Earth radii, but divergence for smaller radii.

The planets' masses, M1 and M2, correspond to those of\nJupiter and Saturn. Hydrodynamical calculations in two and three dimensions are\nused to quantify the migration rates and analyze the conditions under which the\noutward migration mechanism may operate. The planets are taken to be fully\nformed after 1e6 and before 3e6 years. The orbital evolution of the planets in\nan evolving disk is then calculated until the disk's gas is completely\ndissipated. Orbital locking in the 3:2 mean motion resonance may lead to\noutward migration under appropriate conditions of disk viscosity and\ntemperature. However, resonance locking does not necessarily result in outward\nmigration. This is the case, for example, if convergent migration leads to\nlocking in the 2:1 mean motion resonance, as post-formation disk conditions\nseem to suggest. Accretion of gas on the planets may deactivate the outward\nmigration mechanism by raising the mass ratio M2/M1 and/or by reducing the\naccretion rate toward the star, hence depleting the inner disk. For migrating\nplanets locked in the 3:2 mean motion resonance, there are stalling radii that\ndepend on disk viscosity and on stellar irradiation, when it determines the\ndisk's thermal balance.

In an intermediate regime, with a\nmass range that depends on the uncertain details of rotation and mass loss\nduring the star's life, a NS is initially formed which then experiences\nfallback accretion and collapse to a BH. The electromagnetic consequence of\nsuch an event is not clear. Depending on the progenitor's structure,\npossibilities range from a long gamma-ray burst to a Type II supernova (that\nmay or may not be jet-powered) to a collapse with a weak electromagnetic\nsignature. Gravitational waves (GWs) provide the exciting opportunity to peer\nthrough the envelope of a dying massive star and directly probe what is\noccurring inside. We explore whether fallback onto young NSs can be detected by\nground-based interferometers. When the incoming material has sufficient angular\nmomentum to form a disk, the accretion spins up the NS sufficiently to produce\nnon-axisymmetric instabilities and gravitational radiation at frequencies of\n~700-2400 Hz for ~30-3000 s until collapse to a BH occurs.

Previous analysis of this cluster revealed a large\ndispersion in the line strength of the infrared Ca II triplet, suggesting an\nintrinsic star-to-star scatter in its Fe or Ca content. From our analysis, we\nassess that all the investigated stars share the same [Fe/H], [Ca/Fe] and\n[Ti/Fe] abundance ratios, while a large spread in Mg and K abundances is\ndetected. The distribution of [Mg/Fe] is bimodal, with ~40% of the observed\ntargets having subsolar [Mg/Fe], down to [Mg/Fe] ~ -1 dex, a level of\nMg-deficiency never observed before in globular clusters. It is found that the\nlarge dispersion in Mg abundances is likely the main origin of the observed\ndispersion of the Ca II triplet lines strengths (that can be erroneously\ninterpreted in terms of Fe or Ca abundance scatter) because Mg plays a relevant\nrole in the atmosphere of giant stars as an electron donor.

These results assume a single star forming galaxy\ntemplate; the presence of AGN, and an evolution in their relative contribution\nto the mid-IR galaxy emission, will alter the overall number counts per cluster\nand their rate of evolution. We infer the total SFR per unit cluster mass and\nfind T_SFR/M_c ~ (1+z)^{5.4+/-1.9}. This evolution can be attributed entirely\nto the change in the in-falling field galaxy population.

Here we consider\nevidence for IMF variation in a sample of relatively compact early-type\ngalaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. These galaxies are of\nsufficiently high stellar density that a dark halo likely makes a minor\ncontribution to the total dynamical mass, Mdyn, within one effective radius. We\nfit our detailed stellar population synthesis models to the stacked absorption\nline spectra of these galaxies in bins of sigma and find evidence from\nIMF-sensitive spectral features for a bottom-heavy IMF at high sigma. We also\napply simple `mass-follows-light' dynamical models to the same data and find\nthat Mdyn is significantly higher than what would be expected if these galaxies\nwere stellar dominated and had a universal Milky Way IMF.

Abstract: Given a solar luminosity L_Ar = 0.75 L_0 at the beginning of the Archean 3.8\nGyr ago, where L_0 is the present-day one, if the heliocentric distance r of\nthe Earth was r_Ar = 0.956 r_0, the solar irradiance would have been as large\nas I_Ar = 0.82 I_0. It would allowed for a liquid ocean on the terrestrial\nsurface which, otherwise, would have been frozen, contrary to the empirical\nevidence. By further assuming that some physical mechanism subsequently\ndisplaced the Earth towards its current distance in such a way that the\nirradiance stayed substantially constant over the entire Archean from 3.8 Gyr\nto 2.5 Gyr ago, a relative recession rate as large as \\dot r/r \\simeq 3.4 x\n10^-11 yr^-1 would have been required. Although such a figure is roughly of the\nsame order of magnitude of the value of the Hubble parameter 3.8 Gyr ago H_Ar =\n1.192 H_0 = 8.2 x 10^-11 yr^-1, standard general relativity rules out\ncosmological explanations for the hypothesized Earth' s recession rate.\nInstead, a class of modified theories of gravitation with nonminimal coupling\nbetween the matter and the metric naturally predicts a secular variation of the\nrelative distance of a localized two-body system, thus yielding a potentially\nviable candidate to explain the putative recession of the Earth' s orbit.\nAnother competing mechanism of classical origin which could, in principle,\nallow for the desired effect is the mass loss which either the Sun or the Earth\nitself may have experienced during the Archean. On the one hand, this implies\nthat our planet should have lost 2% of its present mass in the form of\neroded/evaporated hydrosphere which, thus, should have been two orders of\nmagnitude larger than now.

In this work, we identify informative wavelength regions in\na single-burst stellar populations model by using the CUR Matrix Decomposition.\nSimulating the Lick/IDS spectrograph configuration, we recover the widely used\nDn(4000), Hbeta, and HdeltaA to be most informative. Simulating the SDSS\nspectrograph configuration with a wavelength range 3450-8350 Angstrom and a\nmodel-limited spectral resolution of 3 Angstrom, the most informative regions\nare: first region-the 4000 Angstrom break and the Hdelta line; second\nregion-the Fe-like indices; third region-the Hbeta line; fourth region-the G\nband and the Hgamma line.

While most of\nthese shocks are weak and inefficient accelerators of cosmic rays (CRs), there\nare a number of strong, energetic shocks which can produce large amounts of CR\nprotons via diffusive shock acceleration.

The spatial resolution\n(1.2 kpc) is sufficient to show that the ionized gas in these galaxies (as\ntraced by H-beta emission) is morphologically irregular, forming multiple giant\nclumps while stellar continuum light is smooth and well described by an\nexponential profile.

We show that in the\nfiducial case of $10^4$ distinct cells in chemical space and $10^5-10^6$ stars\nin the survey, one can expect to detect $\\sim 10^2-10^3$ groups that are $\\ge\n5\\sigma$ overdensities in the chemical space. However, we find that even very\nlarge overdensities in chemical space do not guarantee that the overdensity is\ndue to a single set of stars from a common birth cloud. In fact, for our\nfiducial model parameters, the typical $5\\sigma$ overdensity is comprised of\nstars from a wide range of clusters with the most dominant cluster contributing\nonly 25% of the stars. The most important factors limiting the identification\nof disrupted clusters via chemical tagging are the number of chemical cells in\nthe chemical space and the survey sampling rate of the underlying stellar\npopulation. Both of these factors can be improved through strategic\nobservational plans. While recovering individual clusters through chemical\ntagging may prove challenging, we show, in agreement with previous work, that\ndifferent CMFs imprint different degrees of clumpiness in chemical space. These\ndifferences provide the opportunity to statistically reconstruct the slope and\nhigh mass cutoff of CMF and its evolution through cosmic time. \n\n"}

Significant variations of the gas-to-dust ratio are found both from\ncloud to cloud and within regions of individual clouds; within the clouds, the\natomic gas per unit dust decreases by more than a factor of 3 compared to the\nstandard gas-to-dust ratio.

Because the ISM is turbulent, a given\npatch of ISM exhibits sub-patches with a range of surface densities. The\nhigh-density patches are 'pushed' by feedback, thereby driving turbulence and\nself-regulating local star formation. Sufficiently low-density patches,\nhowever, are accelerated to above the escape velocity before the region can\nself-adjust and are thus vented as outflows. In the\nturbulent-pressure-supported regime, when the gas fraction is $\\gtrsim 0.3$,\nthe ratio of the turbulent velocity dispersion to the circular velocity is\nsufficiently high that at any given time, of order half of the ISM has surface\ndensity less than the critical value and thus can be blown out on a dynamical\ntime. The resulting outflows have a mass-loading factor ($\\eta \\equiv M_{\\rm\nout}/M_{\\star}$) that is inversely proportional to the gas fraction times the\ncircular velocity. At low gas fractions, the star formation rate needed for\nlocal self-regulation, and corresponding turbulent Mach number, decline\nrapidly; the ISM is 'smoother', and it is actually more difficult to drive\nwinds with large mass-loading factors.

The remarkable observation that many\nsingle O stars spin very rapidly can be explained if they accreted angular\nmomentum from a mass-transferring, O-type or Wolf-Rayet companion before that\nstar blew up as a supernova. To test this prediction, we have measured the spin\nrates of eight O stars in Wolf-Rayet (WR) + O binaries, increasing the total\nsample size of such O stars' measured spins from two to ten. Polarimetric and\nother determinations of these systems' sin i allow us to determine an average\nequatorial rotation velocity from HeI (HeII) lines of $v_e$ = 348 (173) km/s\nfor these O stars, with individual star's $v_e$ from HeI (HeII) lines ranging\nfrom 482 (237) to 290 (91) km/s. We argue that the $\\sim$ 100\\% difference\nbetween HeI and HeII speeds is due to gravity darkening. Super-synchronous\nspins, now observed in all 10 O stars in WR + O binaries where it has been\nmeasured, are strong observational evidence that Roche lobe overflow mass\ntransfer from a WR progenitor companion has played a critical role in the\nevolution of WR+OB binaries.

We find that such motions lead to strong global outflows in the\nhighly-compact disks that were common at high redshifts, but weak or negligible\nmass loss in the more diffuse disks that are prevalent today.

For the Bunch-Davies vacuum state, we\nevaluate the expectation values (VEVs) of the electric field squared and of the\nenergy-momentum tensor. The shell-induced contributions are explicitly\nextracted. In this way, for points away from the shell, the renormalization is\nreduced to the one for the VEVs in the boundary-free dS bulk. As a special\ncase, the VEVs are obtained for a cylindrical shell in the $(D+1)$%\n-dimensional Minkowski bulk. We show that the shell-induced contribution in the\nelectric field squared is positive for both the interior and exterior regions.\nThe corresponding Casimir-Polder forces are directed toward the shell. The\nvacuum energy-momentum tensor, in addition to the diagonal components, has a\nnonzero off-diagonal component corresponding to the energy flux along the\ndirection normal to the shell. This flux is directed from the shell in both the\nexterior and interior regions. For points near the shell, the leading terms in\nthe asymptotic expansions for the electric field squared and diagonal\ncomponents of the energy-momentum tensor are obtained from the corresponding\nexpressions in the Minkowski bulk replacing the distance from the shell by the\nproper distance in the dS bulk. The influence of the gravitational field on the\nlocal characteristics of the vacuum is essential at distances from the shell\nlarger than the dS curvature radius. The results are extended for confining\nboundary conditions of flux tube models in QCD. \n\n"}

Recent galaxy formation simulations\nhave demonstrated the need for active CR transport either in the form of\ndiffusion or streaming to successfully launch winds in galaxies. However, due\nto computational limitations, most previous simulations have modeled CR\ntransport isotropically. Here, we discuss high resolution simulations of\nisolated disk galaxies in a $10^{11}\\rm{M_\\odot}$ halo with the moving mesh\ncode {\\sc Arepo} that include injection of CRs from supernovae, advective\ntransport, CR cooling, and CR transport through isotropic or anisotropic\ndiffusion. We show that either mode of diffusion leads to the formation of\nstrong bipolar outflows. However, they develop significantly later in the\nsimulation with anisotropic diffusion compared to the simulation with isotropic\ndiffusion. Moreover, we find that isotropic diffusion allows most of the CRs to\nquickly diffuse out of the disk, while in the simulation with anisotropic\ndiffusion, most CRs remain in the disk once the magnetic field becomes\ndominated by its azimuthal component, which occurs after $\\sim 300\\,{\\rm\nMyrs}$. This has important consequences for the gas dynamics in the disk. In\nparticular, we show that isotropic diffusion strongly suppresses the\namplification of the magnetic field in the disk compared to anisotropic or no\ndiffusion models. We therefore conclude that reliable simulations which include\nCR transport inevitably need to account for anisotropic diffusion. \n\n"}

Stress buildup\nand yielding in a magnetar crust is a global phenomenon: an elastic distortion\nradiating from one plastically deforming zone is shown to dramatically increase\nthe creep rate in distant zones. Runaway creep to dynamical rates is shown to\nbe possible, being enhanced by in situ heating and suppressed by thermal\nconduction and shearing of an embedded magnetic field. A global and\ntime-dependent model of elastic, plastic, magnetic, and thermal evolution is\ndeveloped. Fault-like structures develop naturally, and a range of outburst\ntimescales is observed. Transient events with time profiles similar to giant\nmagnetar flares (millisecond rise, $\\sim$ 0.1 s duration, and decaying\npower-law tails) result from runaway creep that starts in localized\nsub-km-sized patches and spreads across the crust.

Here we show how the E- and B-mode powers depend on the\ndetailed properties of the fluctuations in the magnetized interstellar medium.\nThese fluctuations are classified into the slow, fast, and Alfv\\'en\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves, which are determined once the ratio of gas to\nmagnetic-field pressures is specified.

We\nfind that the observed EE/BB ratio (and its scale invariance) and positive TE\ncorrelation cannot be easily explained in terms of favored models for MHD\nturbulence. The observed power-law index for temperature/polarization\nfluctuations also disfavors MHD turbulence. We thus speculate that the 0.1--30\npc length scales probed by these dust-polarization measurements are not\ndescribed by MHD turbulence but, rather, probe the large-scale physics that\ndrives ISM turbulence.

We have found that, if these LSB galaxies were\nat the distances of NGC 3193 and HCG 44, they would show sizes and luminosities\nsimilar to those of the ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) found in the Coma cluster\nand other associations. In that case, their sizes would be rather larger than\nthose displayed by the Local Group dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies. We have\ndetected a few unresolved sources in the sky zone occupied by these galaxies\nshowing colors and brightnesses typical of blue globular clusters. Conclusions.\nFrom the comparison of the properties of the galaxies presented in this work,\nwith those of similar objects reported in the literature, we have found that\nLSB galaxies display sizes covering a quite extended continous range (reff ~\n0.3 - 4.5 kpc), in contrast to \"normal\" early-type galaxies, which shows reff ~\n1.0 kpc with a low dispersion. This fact might be pointing to different\nformation processes for both types of galaxies. \n\n"}

Assuming the standard cosmological history\npreceded by inflation, $Q$-balls can form in the early universe and can make up\nthe dark matter. The relatively large masses of such dark-matter particles\nimply a low number density, making direct detection very challenging. The\nstrongest limits come from the existence of neutron stars because, if a\nbaryonic $Q$-ball is captured by a neutron star, the $Q$-ball can absorb the\nbaryon number releasing energy and eventually destroying a neutron star.\nHowever, in the presence of baryon number violating higher-dimension operators,\nthe growth of a $Q$-ball inside a neutron star is hampered once the $Q$-ball\nreaches a certain size.

Motivated by the evidence for powerful\nradiative shocks within nova outflows, we propose that dust formation occurs\nwithin the cool, dense shell behind these shocks. We incorporate a simple\nmolecular chemistry network and classical nucleation theory with a model for\nthe thermodynamic evolution of the post-shock gas, in order to demonstrate the\nformation of both carbon and forsterite ($\\rm Mg_2SiO_4$) grains. The high\ndensities due to radiative shock compression ($n \\sim 10^{14}$ cm$^{-3}$)\nresult in CO saturation and rapid dust nucleation. Grains grow efficiently to\nlarge sizes $\\gtrsim 0.1\\mu$m, in agreement with IR observations of\ndust-producing novae, and with total dust masses sufficient to explain massive\nextinction events such as V705 Cas. As in dense stellar winds, dust formation\nis CO-regulated, with carbon-rich flows producing carbon-rich grains and\noxygen-rich flows primarily forming silicates. CO is destroyed by non-thermal\nparticles accelerated at the shock, allowing additional grain formation at late\ntimes, but the efficiency of this process appears to be low. Given observations\nshowing that individual novae produce both carbonaceous and silicate grains, we\nconcur with previous works attributing this bimodality to chemical\nheterogeneity of the ejecta.

The time lag between the\nhard (20 to 40 keV) and soft (5 to 10 keV) bands varies in a step-like manner\nbeing nearly constant at 50 Milli-seconds from 0.3 to 0.9 Hz, decreasing to 8\nMilli-seconds from 2 to 5 Hz and finally dropping to 2 Milli-seconds for higher\nfrequencies.

We study fluid collapse, using the close analogy\nbetween the gas entropy and the PPSD in the fluid approximation. Our\nhydrodynamic calculations allow for a precise evaluation of logarithmic\nderivatives. For scale-free initial conditions, entropy is a power law in\nLagrangian (mass) coordinates, but not in Eulerian (radial) coordinates. The\ndeviation from a radial power law arises from incomplete hydrostatic\nequilibrium (HSE), linked to bulk inflow and mass accretion, and the\nconvergence to the asymptotic central power-law slope is very slow. For more\nrealistic collapse, entropy is not a power law with either radius or mass due\nto deviations from HSE and scale-dependent initial conditions. Instead, it is a\nslowly rolling power law that appears approximately linear on a log-log plot.\nOur fluid calculations recover PPSD power-law slopes and residual amplitudes\nsimilar to N-body simulations, indicating that deviations from a power law are\nnot numerical artefacts. In addition, we find that realistic collapse is not\nself-similar: scale lengths such as the shock radius and the turnaround radius\nare not power-law functions of time. We therefore argue that the apparent\npower-law PPSD cannot be used to make detailed dynamical inferences or\nextrapolate halo profiles inward, and that it does not indicate any hidden\nintegrals of motion. We also suggest that the apparent agreement between the\nPPSD and the asymptotic Bertschinger slope is purely coincidental. \n\n"}

Recent\nobservations of Fermi-LAT exhibit a hardening of the gamma-ray spectrum at\naround a hundred GeV, between the Sagittarius and Carina tangents, and a\nfurther hardening at a few degrees above and below the Galactic plane. However,\nstandard CR propagation models that assume a time independent source\ndistribution and a location independent diffusion cannot give rise to a\nspatially dependent CR (and hence gamma-ray) spectral slopes.

In the case\nof chameleon theories, the screening has two contributions -- self-screening,\nwhich is due to the mass of an object itself, and environmental screening,\nwhich is caused by the surrounding matter -- which are often entangled, with\nthe second contribution being more crucial for less massive objects. A\nquantitative understanding of the effect of the environment on the screening\ncan prove critical in observational tests of such theories using systems such\nas the Local Group and dwarf galaxies, for which the environment may be\ninferred in various ways.

One of the\nadvantages of near-infrared surveys, when compared to optical counterparts, is\nthat the interstellar extinction is significantly smaller. As we see in this\nreview, a significant volume of the Galactic disk can be reached by infrared\nsurveys but not by optical ones. Towards highly obscured regions in the\nGalactic mid-plane, however, the interstellar extinction causes serious\nproblems even with near-infrared data in understanding the observational\nresults. After a review on previous and current near-infrared surveys, we\ndiscuss the effects of the interstellar extinction in optical (including {\\it\nGaia}) to near-infrared broad bands based on a simple calculation using\nsynthetic spectral energy distribution. We then review the recent results on\nclassical Cepheids towards the Galactic center and the bulge, as a case study,\nto see the impact of the uncertainty in the extinction law. The extinction law,\ni.e. the wavelength dependency of the extinction, is not fully characterized,\nand its uncertainty makes it hard to make the correction. Its characterization\nis an urgent task in order to exploit the outcomes of ongoing large-scale\nsurveys of pulsating stars, e.g. for drawing a map of pulsating stars across\nthe Galactic disk. \n\n"}

In the model the gas is in vertical pressure and energy\nbalance. Star formation feedback injects energy and momentum, and\nnon-axisymmetric torques prevent the gas from becoming more than marginally\ngravitationally unstable. From these assumptions we derive the relationship\nbetween galaxies' bulk properties (gas surface density, stellar content, and\nrotation curve) and their star formation rates, gas velocity dispersions, and\nrates of radial inflow. We show that the turbulence in discs can be powered\nprimarily by star formation feedback, radial transport, or a combination of the\ntwo. In contrast to models that omit either radial transport or star formation\nfeedback, the predictions of this model yield excellent agreement with a wide\nrange of observations, including the star formation law measured in both\nspatially resolved and unresolved data, the correlation between galaxies' star\nformation rates and velocity dispersions, and observed rates of radial inflow.\nThe agreement holds across a wide range of galaxy mass and type, from local\ndwarfs to extreme starbursts to high-redshifts discs. We apply the model to\ngalaxies on the star-forming main sequence, and show that it predicts a\ntransition from mostly gravity-driven turbulence at high redshift to star\nformation-driven turbulence at low redshift. This transition, and the changes\nin mass transport rates that it produces, naturally explain why galaxy bulges\ntend to form at high redshift and discs at lower redshift, and why galaxies\ntend to quench inside-out. \n\n"}

In 2D, only the nonrotating\nand slowly rotating models explode, while rapid rotation prevents an explosion\nwithin 500 ms after bounce because of lower radiated neutrino luminosities and\nmean energies and thus reduced neutrino heating. In contrast, only the fast\nrotating model develops an explosion in 3D when the Si/Si-O interface collapses\nthrough the shock.

We apply our Lyman-$\\alpha$ RT code by post-processing\nthe full Illustris simulations.

We\nargue that the anisotropy was overestimated in the previous work due to the\ninsufficient spatial resolution: it is important to keep the resolution such\nthat it resolves the high density region down to the scale of the interstellar\nmedium, $\\sim1$ physical kpc.

Especially when the presence of IMBHs is constrained through\ndynamical modeling of stellar kinematics, it is fundamental to account for the\ndisplacement that the IMBH might have with respect to the GC centre. In this\npaper we analyse the IMBH wandering around the stellar density centre using a\nset of realistic direct N-body simulations of star cluster evolution. Guided by\nthe simulation results, we develop a basic yet accurate model that can be used\nto estimate the average IMBH radial displacement ($\\left<r_\\mathrm{bh}\\right>$)\nin terms of structural quantities as the core radius ($r_\\mathrm{c}$), mass\n($M_\\mathrm{c}$), and velocity dispersion ($\\sigma_\\mathrm{c}$), in addition to\nthe average stellar mass ($m_\\mathrm{c}$) and the IMBH mass ($M_\\mathrm{bh}$).\nThe model can be expressed by the equation\n$\\left<r_\\mathrm{bh}\\right>/r_\\mathrm{c}=A(m_\\mathrm{c}/M_\\mathrm{bh})^\\alpha[\\sigma_\\mathrm{c}^2r_\\mathrm{c}/(GM_\\mathrm{c})]^\\beta$,\nin which the free parameters $A,\\alpha,\\beta$ are calculated through comparison\nwith the numerical results on the IMBH displacement.

Varying the BHB mass\nand mass ratio and the GC orbit, we show that the reciprocal feedback exerted\nbetween GCs and the BHB shapes their global properties.

Dispersal of\n  Star-Forming Giant Molecular Clouds by Photoionization and Radiation Pressure Abstract: UV radiation feedback from young massive stars plays a key role in the\nevolution of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) by photoevaporating and ejecting the\nsurrounding gas. We conduct a suite of radiation hydrodynamic simulations of\nstar cluster formation in marginally-bound, turbulent GMCs, focusing on the\neffects of photoionization and radiation pressure on regulating the net star\nformation efficiency (SFE) and cloud lifetime. We find that the net SFE depends\nprimarily on the initial gas surface density, $\\Sigma_0$, such that the SFE\nincreases from 4% to 51% as $\\Sigma_0$ increases from $13\\,M_{\\odot}\\,{\\rm\npc}^{-2}$ to $1300\\,M_{\\odot}\\,{\\rm pc}^{-2}$. Cloud destruction occurs within\n$2$-$10\\,{\\rm Myr}$ after the onset of radiation feedback, or within\n$0.6$-$4.1$ freefall times (increasing with $\\Sigma_0$). Photoevaporation\ndominates the mass loss in massive, low surface-density clouds, but because\nmost photons are absorbed in an ionization-bounded Str\\\"{o}mgren volume the\nphotoevaporated gas fraction is proportional to the square root of the SFE.

We model this\nobliquity-dependent acceleration process in a spherically expanding blast wave\nsetup with the moving-mesh code {\\sc arepo} for different magnetic field\nmorphologies, ranging from homogeneous to turbulent configurations. A\nSedov-Taylor explosion in a homogeneous magnetic field generates an oblate\nellipsoidal shock surface due to the slower propagating blast wave in the\ndirection of the magnetic field. This is because of the efficient cosmic ray\n(CR) production in the quasi-parallel polar cap regions, which softens the\nequation of state and increases the compressibility of the post-shock gas. We\nfind that the solution remains self-similar because the ellipticity of the\npropagating blast wave stays constant in time.

The scope is to make the analysis of nonthermal\nelectrons dynamics and plasma heating in the highly stressed magnetic loops\ninteracting in the PIL by using X-ray, microwave, ultraviolet, and optical\nobservations.

At low thresholds (LT), gas is unable to reach densities high\nenough to dominate the gravitational potential before being dispersed by\nfeedback from supernovae. LT runs show little effect on the inner DM profile,\neven in systems with extended and bursty SF, two ingredients often cited as\ncritical for core formation. For higher thresholds, gas is able to dominate the\ngravitational potential before being ejected by feedback. This can lead to a\nsubstantial reduction in the inner DM content, but only if the gas is\ngravitationally important over an extended period of time, allowing the halo to\ncontract before gas removal.

They are, however, promising candidates for\nthe progenitors of the heaviest binary black hole (BBH) mergers detected. If\nthese BBHs are the product of binary evolution, then PPISNe could occur in very\nclose binaries. Motivated by this, we discuss the implications of a PPISN\nhappening with a close binary companion, and what impact these events have on\nthe formation of merging BBHs through binary evolution. For this, we have\ncomputed a set of models of metal-poor ($Z_\\odot/10$) single helium stars using\nthe \\texttt{MESA} software instrument. For PPISN progenitors with pre-pulse\nmasses $>50M_\\odot$ we find that, after a pulse, heat deposited throughout the\nlayers of the star that remain bound cause it to expand to more than\n$100R_\\odot$ for periods of $10^2-10^4\\;$~yrs depending on the mass of the\nprogenitor. This results in long-lived phases of Roche-lobe overflow or even\ncommon-envelope events if there is a close binary companion, leading to\nadditional electromagnetic transients associated to PPISN eruptions. If we\nignore the effect of these interactions, we find that mass loss from PPISNe\nreduces the final black hole spin by $\\sim 30\\%$, induces eccentricities below\nthe threshold of detectability of the LISA observatory, and can produce a\ndouble-peaked distribution of measured chirp masses in BBH mergers observed by\nground-based detectors. \n\n"}

We consider a\n``collisional starburst'' model in which bursts of star formation are triggered\nby galaxy-galaxy mergers, and find that a significant fraction of LBGs are\npredicted to be starbursts. This model reproduces the observed comoving number\ndensity of bright LBGs as a function of redshift and the observed luminosity\nfunction at $z\\sim 3$ and $z\\sim 4$, with a reasonable amount of dust\nextinction. Model galaxies at $z \\sim 3$ have star formation rates, half-light\nradii, I-K colours, and internal velocity dispersions that are in good\nagreement with the data. Global quantities such as the star formation rate\ndensity and cold gas and metal content of the Universe as a function of\nredshift also agree well.

In one, the star formation efficiency in galaxies remains\nconstant with redshift, while in the other, it scales inversely with disc\ndynamical time, and thus increases rapidly with redshift. The first quiescent\nmodel is strongly ruled out as it does not produce enough high redshift\ngalaxies once realistic dust extinction is accounted for. The second quiescent\nmodel fits marginally, but underproduces cold gas and very bright galaxies at\nhigh redshift.

In the model, the M_bh - sigma relation is significantly tighter than\nthe correlation between black hole mass and bulge luminosity or the correlation\nbetween bulge luminosity and velocity dispersion.

This is due to the projection\neffects inherent in catalogues of clusters constructed using 2 dimensional\ndata. Many of the clusters found in 2d have no significant 3d counterparts, and\nmost suffer from massive background contamination that cannot be corrected for\nby subtracting random offset fields.

Our observations with HST/WFPC2 provide\ndata for the (I vs. V-I) and (V vs. V-I) color-magnitude diagrams.

We find\nthat even quite fast jets (gamma~10) can be significantly influenced by\nimpinging on an oblique density gradient, exhibiting a rotation of the Mach\ndisk in the jet's head. The flow is bent via a potentially strong, oblique\ninternal shock that arises due to asymmetric perturbation of the flow by its\ncocoon. In extreme cases this cocoon can form a marginally relativistic flow\northogonal to the jet, leading to large scale dynamics quite unlike that\nnormally associated with astrophysical jets. Exploration of a gamma=5 flow\nsubject to a large amplitude precession (semi-angle 11.25dg) shows that it\nretains its integrity, with modest reduction in Lorentz factor and momentum\nflux, for almost 50 jet-radii, but thereafter, the collimated flow is\ndisrupted. The flow is approximately ballistic, with velocity vectors not\naligned with the local jet `wall'. We consider simple estimators of the flow\nemissivity in each case and conclude that a) while the oblique internal shocks\nwhich mediate a small change in the direction of the deflected flows have\nlittle impact on the global dynamics, significantly enhanced flow emission (by\na factor of 2-3) may be associated with such regions; and b) the convolution of\nrest frame emissivity and Doppler boost in the case of the precessed jet\ninvariably leads to a core-jet-like structure, but that intensity fluctuations\nin the jet cannot be uniquely associated with either change in internal\nconditions or Doppler boost alone, but in general are a combination of both\nfactors. \n\n"}

These galaxies, as measured from SDSS and\nin the Local Group, show tight correlations of internal velocity, metallicity\nand surface brightness (or radius) with M*.

The idealized model assumes spherical collapse of CDM haloes to\nvirial equilibrium and angular-momentum conservation. The relations for bright\ngalaxies are reproduced by assuming that M* is a constant fraction of the halo\nmass M. The upper bound to the low-luminosity LSBs coincides with the virial\nvelocity of haloes in which supernova feedback could significantly suppress\nstar formation, V<100km/s (Dekel & Silk 1986).

{"id": "astro-ph/0303240", "contents": "Title: On the Origin of the Global Schmidt Law of Star Formation Abstract: One of the most puzzling properties of observed galaxies is the universality\nof the empirical correlation between the star formation rate and average gas\nsurface density on kiloparsec scales (the Schmidt law). In this study I present\nresults of self-consistent cosmological simulations of high-redshift galaxy\nformation that reproduce the Schmidt law naturally, without assuming it, and\nprovide some clues to this puzzle. The simulations incorporate the main\nphysical processes critical to various aspects of galaxy formation and have a\ndynamic range high enough to identify individual star forming regions. The\nresults indicate that the global Schmidt law is a manifestation of the overall\ndensity distribution of the interstellar medium (ISM). In particular, the\ndensity probability distribution function (PDF) in the simulated disks is\nsimilar to that observed in recent state-of-the-art modeling of the turbulent\nISM and has a well-defined generic shape. The shape of the PDF in a given\nregion of the disk depends on the local average surface density Sigma_g. The\ndependence is such that the fraction of gas mass in the high-density tail of\nthe distribution scales as Sigma_g^{n-1} with n~1.4, which gives rise to the\nSchmidt-like correlation. The high-density tail of the PDF is remarkably\ninsensitive to the inclusion of feedback and details of the cooling and heating\nprocesses. This indicates that the global star formation rate is determined by\nthe supersonic turbulence driven by gravitational instabilities on large\nscales, rather than stellar feedback or thermal instabilities on small scales. \n\n"}

The\nspectrum is marked by a sharp drop in flux at 0.7 keV which has been\ninterpreted by Branduardi-Raymont et al. as the blue wing of a relativistic\nOVIII emission line and by Lee at al. as a dusty warm absorber. We find that\nthe drop is well explained by the FeI L2,3 absorption edges and obtain\nreasonable fits over the 0.32-1.7 keV band using a multizone, dusty warm\nabsorber model. Some residuals remain which could be due to emission from a\nrelativistic disc, but at a much weaker level than from any model relying on\nrelativistic emission lines alone. A model based on such emission lines can be\nmade to fit if sufficient (warm) absorption is added, although the line\nstrengths exceed those expected. The EPIC pn difference spectrum between the\nhighest and lowest flux states of the source indicates that this is a power-law\nin the 3-10 keV band which, if extrapolated to lower energies, reveals the\nabsorption function acting on the intrinsic spectrum, provided that any\nemission lines do not scale exactly with the continuum.

The explosion is supposed to\nbe driven by bipolar jets which are powered by accretion onto a central\nremnant. We explore the features of the explosions with varying progenitors'\nmasses and jet properties. The outcomes are different from conventional\nspherical models. (1) In the bipolar models, Fe-rich materials are ejected at\nhigh velocities along the jet axis, while O-rich materials occupy the central\nregion whose density becomes very high as a consequence of continuous accretion\nfrom the side. This configuration can explain some peculiar features in the\nlight curves and the nebular spectra of hypernovae. (2) Production of $^{56}$Ni\ntends to be smaller than in spherical thermal bomb models. To account for a\nlarge amount of $^{56}$Ni observed in hypernovae, the jets should be initiated\nwhen the compact remnant mass is still smaller than $2-3\\msun$, or the jets\nshould be very massive and slow. (3) Ejected isotopes are distributed as\nfollows in order of decreasing velocities: $^{64}$Zn, $^{59}$Co, $^{56}$Fe,\n$^{44}$Ti, and $^{4}$He at the highest velocities, $^{55}$Mn, $^{52}$Cr,\n$^{32}$S, and $^{28}$Si at the intermediate velocities, and $^{24}$Mg, $^{16}$O\nat the lowest velocities. (4) The abundance ratios (Zn, Co)/Fe are enhanced\nwhile the ratios (Mn, Cr)/Fe are suppressed. This can account for the abundance\npattern of extremely metal-poor stars.

Abstract: A fully analytical formulation is developed to make dynamical friction\nmodeling more realistic. The rate for a satellite to decay its orbit in a host\ngalaxy halo is often severely overestimated when applying ChandraSekhar's\nformula without correcting for the tidal loss of the satellite and the\nadiabactic growth of the host galaxy potential over the Hubble time. As a\nsatellite decays to the inner and denser region of the host galaxy, the high\nambient density speeds up their exchange of energy and angular momentum, but\nshrinks the Roche lobe of the satellite by tides. Eventually both processes of\norbital decay and tidal stripping hang up altogether once the satellite is\nlight enough. These competing processes can be modeled analytically for a\nsatellite if we parametrize the massloss history by an empirical formula. We\nalso incorporate the adiabatic contraction of orbits due to growth of the host\npotential well. Observed dwarf galaxies often show a finite density core, which\ndetermines how much inwards its remnants could be delivered to the host galaxy.\nGhost streams or remnant cores or globular clusters of satellites should\npopulate preferentially the outer halo (e.g., the Magellanic stream and the\nUrsa Minor dwarf), rather than the inner halo (e.g., the Sgr stream and the\nOmega-cen cluster). Massloss due to strong tides in the inner galaxy also makes\nit problematic for any small central black holes in nuclei of satellite\ngalaxies to decay in orbit and merge into the center of the host galaxy. \n\n"}

In particular our\nknowledge of the star formation rate which leads galaxy evolution, i.e.\nluminosity, colors and dust enrichment, is still very poor. Smoothed particle\nhydrodynamic simulations including chemo-photometric evolutionary population\nsynthesis models of isolated collapsing systems endowed with triaxial dark\nmatter halos, gas and the star formation switched on, are a useful tool to shed\nlight on several open questions. This approach, which allows a greater particle\nresolution than a fully consistent cosmological scenario, gives us important\ninsights into connections between dark and luminous matter. Both the initial\nproperties of the halo, as so as its geometry and dynamical state, and total\nmass of the system, drive the galaxy formation and evolution. In our simple\nframework spiral galaxies arise only in systems with both a total mass less\nthan 1.e12 solar masses and a critical value of the baryonic-to-total-mass\nratio, around its cosmological value, 0.1. For the same value of such a ratio\nmore massive systems host more luminous and redder galaxies, as a consequence\nof the stronger burst of star formation arising into their halos earlier on.\nMoreover the star formation does not switch on in the less massive DM halos so\nthat the critical mass to entail a luminous system is 1.e11 solar masses.

These moons are\nthought to have been captured into planetocentric orbits after straying into a\nregion in which the planet's gravitation dominates solar perturbations (the\nHill sphere). This mechanism requires a source of dissipation, such as\ngas-drag, in order to make capture permanent. However, capture by gas-drag\nrequires that particles remain inside the Hill sphere long enough for\ndissipation to be effective. Recently we have proposed that in the circular\nrestricted three-body problem particles may become caught up in `sticky'\nchaotic layers which tends to prolong their sojourn within the planet's Hill\nsphere thereby assisting capture. Here we show that this mechanism survives\nperturbations due to the ellipticity of the planet's orbit. However, Monte\nCarlo simulations indicate that the planet's ability to capture moons decreases\nwith increasing orbital eccentricity. At the actual Jupiter's orbital\neccentricity, this effects in approximately an order of magnitude lower capture\nprobability than estimated in the circular model.

The variation of the indices of\nconcentration and asymmetry with the wavelength reflects the proportion and the\ndistribution of young and old stellar populations in galaxies. In general C is\nfound to decrease from optical to UV, and A is found to increase from optical\nto UV: the patchy appearance of galaxies in UV with no bulge is often very\ndifferent from their counterpart at optical wavelengths, with prominent bulges\nand more regular disks. The variation of C and A with the wavelength is\nquantified.

Thus, all AGNs drop in luminosity by almost an order of\nmagnitude over this redshift range. We show that this observed drop is due to\nAGN downsizing. We directly compare our BLAGN HXLFs with the optical QSO LFs\nand find that the optical QSO LFs do not probe faint enough to see the downturn\nin the BLAGN HXLFs. We rule out galaxy dilution as a partial explanation for\nthe observation that BLAGNs dominate the number densities at the higher X-ray\nluminosities, while optically-narrow AGNs (FWHM<2000 km/s) dominate at the\nlower X-ray luminosities by measuring the nuclear UV/optical properties of the\nChandra sources using the HST ACS GOODS-North data.

Recently, Furlanetto, Zaldarriaga, & Hernquist\ndeveloped a simple analytic model to describe the growth of HII regions during\nthis era. Here, we examine some of the fundamental simplifying assumptions\nbehind this model and generalise it in several important ways. The model\npredicts that the ionized regions attain a well-defined characteristic size R_c\nthat ranges from R_c~1 Mpc in the early phases to R_c>10 Mpc in the late\nphases. We show that R_c is determined primarily by the bias of the galaxies\ndriving reionization; hence measurements of this scale constrain a fundamental\nproperty of the first galaxies. The variance around R_c, on the other hand, is\ndetermined primarily by the underlying matter power spectrum. We then show that\nincreasing the ionizing efficiency of massive galaxies shifts R_c to\nsignificantly larger scales and decreases the importance of recombinations.\nThese differences can be observed with forthcoming redshifted 21 cm surveys\n(increasing the brightness temperature fluctuations by up to a factor of two on\nlarge scales) and with measurements of small-scale anisotropies in the cosmic\nmicrowave background. Finally, we show that stochastic fluctuations in the\ngalaxy population only broaden the bubble size distribution significantly if\nmassive galaxies are responsible for most of the ionizing photons. We argue\nthat the key results of this model are robust to many of our uncertainties\nabout the reionization process. \n\n"}

The sample consists of X-ray or mid-infrared (24 micron) point sources\nwith optical magnitude R<=21.5 mag and optical emission line spectra\ncharacteristic of AGNs. For the range of luminosity and redshift probed by\nAGES, the distribution of estimated Eddington ratios is well described as\nlog-normal with a peak at L_bol/L_edd ~ 1/4 and a dispersion of 0.3 dex. Since\nadditional sources of scatter are minimal, this dispersion must account for\ncontributions from the scatter between estimated and true BH mass and the\nscatter between estimated and true bolometric luminosity. Therefore, we\nconclude that: (1) neither of these sources of error can contribute more than\n\\~0.3 dex rms; and (2) the true Eddington ratios of optically luminous AGNs are\neven more sharply peaked. Because the mass estimation errors must be smaller\nthan ~0.3 dex, we can also investigate the distribution of Eddington ratios at\nfixed BH mass. We show for the first time that the distribution of Eddington\nratios at fixed BH mass is peaked, and that the dearth of AGNs at a factor ~10\nbelow Eddington is real and not an artifact of sample selection. These results\nprovide strong evidence that supermassive BHs gain most of their mass while\nradiating close to the Eddington limit, and they suggest that the fueling rates\nin luminous AGNs are ultimately determined by BH self-regulation of the\naccretion flow rather than galactic scale dynamical disturbances. \n\n"}

Detections are made using both a directional extension of the\nspherical Mexican hat wavelet and the spherical butterfly wavelet. We examine\nthe possibility of foreground contamination and systematics in the WMAP data\nand conclude that these factors are not responsible for the signal that we\ndetect. The wavelet analysis inherently enables us to localise on the sky those\nregions that contribute most strongly to the correlation. On removing these\nlocalised regions the correlation that we detect is reduced in significance, as\nexpected, but it is not eliminated, suggesting that these regions are not the\nsole source of correlation between the data.

We also highligh the almost forgotten fact that Eddington was the first\nphysicist to introduce Special Relativity into the problem and correctly insist\nthat, actually, total energy stored in a star is not the mere Newtonian energy\nbut the total mass energy (E = M c^2). Accordingly, Eddington defined an\n``Einstein Time Scale'' of Evolution where the maximum age of the Sun turned\nout to be t_E = 1.4. 10^{13} yr. We extend this concept by introducing General\nRelativity and show that the minimum value of depletion of total mass-energy is\nt_E =infty not only for Sun but for and sufficiently massive or dense object.\nWe propose that this time scale be known in the name of ``Einstein -\nEddington''. We also point out that, recently, it has been shown that as\nmassive stars undergo continued collapse to become a Black Hole, first they\nbecome extremely relativistic Radiation Pressure Supported Stars. And the life\ntime of such relativistic radiation pressure supported compact stars is indeed\ndictated by this Einstein -Eddington time scale whose concept is formally\ndeveloped here.

Some studies have required compact dark matter halos (constant\nM/L ratio) in order to reconcile gravitational lenses with the HST/WMAP value\nof the Hubble constant (72 +/- 8 km/s /Mpc and 72 +/- 5 km/s /Mpc,\nrespectively). This is in direct contradiction with X-ray, stellar dynamical,\nand weak lensing studies, which all point towards extended halos and isothermal\ndensity profiles. In this work, we examine an up-to-date sample of 13 lensing\ngalaxies resulting in a data set consisting of 21 time delays. We select\nsystems in which there is a single primary lensing galaxy (e.g. excluding\nsystems undergoing mergers). Analysis is performed using analytic models based\nupon a powerlaw density profile (rho \\propto r^-n) of which the isothermal\nprofile is a special case (n = 2). This yields a value of n = 2.11+/-0.12\n(3sigma) for the mean profile when modeling with a prior on the Hubble\nconstant, which is only consistent with isothermality within 3 sigma. Note that\nthis is a formal error from our calculations, and does not include the impact\nof sample selection or simplifications in the lens modeling.

We introduce scatter in galaxy luminosity at fixed halo\nmass into this model, building a conditional luminosity function (CLF) by\nconsidering two possible models: a simple lognormal and a model based on the\ndistribution of concentration in haloes of a given mass. We show that this\nmodel naturally allows an identification of halo/subhalo systems with groups\nand clusters of galaxies, giving rise to a clear central/satellite galaxy\ndistinction.\n  We then use these results to build up the dependence of brightest cluster\ngalaxy (BCG) magnitudes on cluster luminosity, focusing on two statistical\nindicators, the dispersion in BCG magnitude and the magnitude difference\nbetween first and second brightest galaxies.

Short timescale variability (STV) in\nGRB light curves, including ~100 keV gamma-ray pulses observed with BATSE and\ndelayed ~1 keV X-ray flares found with Swift, can be explained by emissions\nfrom an external shock formed by the GRB blast wave colliding with small\ndensity inhomogeneities in the \"frozen pulse\" approximation (eta -> 0, where\nDelta_0 + eta x/Gamma_0^2 is the blast-wave shell width), and perhaps in the\nthin-shell approximation (eta ~ 1/Gamma_0), but not when eta ~ 1. If this\napproximation is valid, then external shock processes could make the dominant\nprompt and afterglow emissions in GRB light curves, consistent with short delay\ntwo-step collapse models for GRBs. \n\n"}

It has been suggested that these planets are in a\nresonance involving persistent misalignment and synchronous precession of their\nspin and orbital angular momenta, a Cassini state, and that the attendant tidal\nheating inflates the planet. We argue against this. Using explicit tidal\nintegrations, we show that although an oblique Cassini state can dissipate many\ntimes the rotational energy of the planet, the rate of dissipation must be much\nless than hypothesized. Dissipation causes the planetary spin to lie at an\nangle to the plane containing the orbital and total angular momenta. If\ndissipation is too rapid, this angle becomes so large that Cassini equilibrium\nis lost. A separate consideration limits the total energy that can be extracted\nfrom the orbit. The source of the torque on the orbit, either an oblique parent\nstar or an inclined third body, aligns with the orbit as it absorbs the angular\nmomentum shed by the planet. Alignment removes the orbital precession required\nby the Cassini state. In combination with observational bounds on the mass and\nsemimajor axis of a possible second planet and with bounds on the stellar\nrotation and obliquity, these constraints make it very unlikely that obliquity\ntides can be the explanation for inflated hot Jupiters, especially HD 209458b. \n\n"}

However, if there is no minimum baryonic collapse mass or if this\nscale is not resolved, then the baryon results err in a systematic fashion. In\nsuch a case, as resolution is increased the baryon distribution tends toward a\nhigher density, more tightly bound state.

Abstract: We investigate the formation of virialized halos due to the gravitational\ncollapse of collisionless matter using high-resolution N-body simulations. A\nvariety of formation scenarios are studied, ranging from hierarchical\nclustering to monolithic radial collapse. The goal of these experiments was to\nstudy departures from the universal density profiles recently found to arise in\ncosmological settings. However, we found that even for models which exhibit\nquite a different formation history, the density and velocity dispersion\nprofiles of the virialized halos are strikingly similar.\n  Power law density profiles do not result even in models with initial power\nlaw profiles and no initial substructure or non-radial motions. Such initial\nconditions give rise to a radial orbit instability which leads to curved\nvelocity dispersion and density profiles. The shapes of the density profiles in\nall our models are well parameterized by the profiles of halos formed in a\ngeneric cosmological setting. Our results show that the universality of dark\nhalo density profiles does not depend crucially on hierarchical merging as has\nbeen suggested recently in the literature.

We also show that this\nprescription does not reproduce the exact result for a sharp transition. Then,\nmore generally, we demonstrate that, in the only case where a bounce can be\nobtained in Einstein General Relativity without facing singularities and/or\nviolation of the standard energy conditions, the bounce cannot be made\narbitrarily short. This contrasts with the standard (inflationary) situation\nwhere the transition between two eras with different values of the equation of\nstate can be considered as instantaneous. We then argue that the usually\nconserved quantities are not constant on a typical bounce time scale. Finally,\nwe also examine the case of a test scalar field (or gravitational waves) where\nsimilar results are obtained.

We observe that a scalar field\ntrapped on a steep potential can induce a stage of acceleration of the\nuniverse, which we call trapped inflation. Moduli trapping ameliorates the\ncosmological moduli problem and may affect vacuum selection. In particular,\nrolling moduli are most powerfully attracted to the points with the largest\nnumber of light particles, which are often the points of greatest symmetry.\nGiven suitable assumptions about the dynamics of the very early universe, this\neffect might help to explain why among the plethora of possible vacuum states\nof string theory, we appear to live in one with a large number of light\nparticles and (spontaneously broken) symmetries.
