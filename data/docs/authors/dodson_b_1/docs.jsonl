An\nimportant new feature of these results is the absense of the near-CMC\nassumption when the rescaled background metric is in the positive Yamabe class,\nif the freely specifiable part of the data given by the matter fields (if\npresent) and the traceless-transverse part of the rescaled extrinsic curvature\nare taken to be sufficiently small. In this case, the mean extrinsic curvature\ncan be taken to be an arbitrary smooth function without restrictions on the\nsize of its spatial derivatives, giving what are apparently the first non-CMC\nexistence results without the near-CMC assumption.

The nonlinearity of the Euler equation makes the\nsymplectic operator inhomogeneous on phase space (the function space of the\nstate variable), and it is seen that this creates a singularity where the\nnullity of the symplectic operator (the \"dimension\" of the center) changes.\nSingular Casimir elements stemming from this singularity are unearthed using a\ngeneralization of the functional derivative that occurs in the Poisson bracket. \n\n"}

We prove that, up to\nconjugation with 1-homogenic birational plane transformation, these are of 6\ntypes: 1) the identity flow; 2) one flow for each non-negative integer N -\nthese flows are rational of level N; 3) the level 1 exponential flow, which is\nalso conjugate to the level 1 tangent flow; 4) the level 3 flow expressable in\nterms of Dixonian (equianharmonic) elliptic functions; 5) the level 4 flow\nexpressable in terms of lemniscatic elliptic functions; 6) the level 6 flow\nexpressable in terms of Dixonian elliptic functions again. This reveals another\naspect of the PrTE: in the latter four cases this equation is equivalent and\nprovides a uniform framework to addition formulas for exponential, tangent, or\nspecial elliptic functions (also addition formulas for polynomials and the\nlogarithm, though the latter appears only in branched flows). Moreover, the\nPrTE turns out to have a connection with Polya-Eggenberger urn models. Another\npurpose of this study is expository, and we provide the list of open problems\nand directions in the theory of PrTE; for example, we define the notion of\nquasi-rational projective flows which includes curves of arbitrary genus. \n\n"}

Part I Abstract: Consider two domains connected by a thin tube: it can be shown that,\ngenerically, the mass of a given eigenfunction of the Dirichlet Laplacian\nconcentrates in only one of them. The restriction to the other domain, when\nsuitably normalized, develops a singularity at the junction of the tube, as the\nchannel section tends to zero. Our main result states that, under a\nnondegeneracy condition, the normalized limiting profile has a singularity of\norder N-1, where N is the space dimension. We give a precise description of the\nasymptotic behavior of eigenfunctions at the singular junction, which provides\nus with some important information about its sign near the tunnel entrance.\nMore precisely, the solution is shown to be one-sign in a neighborhood of the\nsingular junction.

Considered to be one of the\nfundamental open problems in the area of nonlinear dispersive equations, this\nconjecture has eluded a proof or even a precise formulation till date. This\npaper proves a \"statistical version\" of this conjecture at mass-subcritical\nnonlinearity, in the following sense. The uniform probability distribution on\nthe set of all functions with a given mass and energy, if such a thing existed,\nwould be a natural invariant measure for the NLS flow and would reflect the\nlong-term behavior for \"generic initial data\" with that mass and energy.\nUnfortunately, such a probability measure does not exist. We circumvent this\nproblem by constructing a sequence of discrete measures that, in principle,\napproximate this fictitious probability distribution as the grid size goes to\nzero. We then show that a continuum limit of this sequence of probability\nmeasures does exist in a certain sense, and in agreement with the soliton\nresolution conjecture, the limit measure concentrates on the unique ground\nstate soliton.

The first main result\nstates that the boundary measurements uniquely determine a mixed Fourier\ntransform / attenuated geodesic ray transform (or integral against a more\ngeneral semiclassical limit measure) of an unknown coefficient.

We study how the association of transport and collision\nphenomena can lead to convergence to equilibrium, using concepts and ideas from\ncontrol theory. We prove two main classes of results.

Cauchy found a Lagrangian formulation of 3D ideal\nincompressible flow in terms of three invariants that generalize to three\ndimensions the now well-known law of conservation of vorticity along fluid\nparticle trajectories for two-dimensional flow. This has very recently been\nused to prove analyticity in time of fluid particle trajectories for 3D\nincompressible Euler flow and can be extended to compressible flow, in\nparticular to cosmological dark matter.

The\nmacroscopic (homogenized) equation is derived as another stochastic partial\ndifferential equation, defined in the whole non perforated domain. Here, the\ninitial stochastic perturbation on the boundary becomes part of the homogenized\nequation as another stochastic force. We use the two-scale convergence method\nafter extending the solution with 0 in the wholes to pass to the limit. By\nIt\\^o stochastic calculus, we get uniform estimates on the solution in\nappropriate spaces. In order to pass to the limit on the boundary integrals, we\nrewrite them in terms of integrals in the whole domain.

Our approach uses minimal assumptions on the\ncoefficients, and in particular does not require De Giorgi-Nash-Moser\nestimates. Our results are completely new for the Hardy-Sobolev case, and in\nthe Besov case they extend results recently obtained by Barton and Mayboroda.\n  First we develop a theory of BHS spaces adapted to operators which are\nbisectorial on $L^2$, with bounded $H^\\infty$ functional calculus on their\nranges, and which satisfy $L^2$ off-diagonal estimates. In particular, this\ntheory applies to perturbed Dirac operators $DB$. We then prove that for a\nnontrivial range of exponents (the identification region) the BHS spaces\nadapted to $DB$ are equal to those adapted to $D$ (which correspond to\nclassical BHS spaces).\n  Our main result is the classification of solutions of the elliptic system\n$\\operatorname{div} A \\nabla u = 0$ within a certain region of exponents.

The size $\\ell^3$ of the periodic domains must be increased\nas $\\nu$ is decreased to maintain this scaling as implied by known Sobolev\nspace bounds. The anti-parallel calculations show that the linear collapse of\n$B_\\nu(t)$ begins with a quick, viscosity-independent exchange of the\ncirculation $\\Gamma$ between the original vortices and the new vortices. Up to\nand after the trefoil knots' first reconnection at time $t_x$, their helicity\n${\\cal H}$ is preserved, validating the experimental centreline helicity\nobservation of Scheeler et al (2014a). Because the cubic Navier-Stokes velocity\nnorm $L_3$ barely changes and the Navier-Stokes $\\|\\omega\\|_\\infty$ are bounded\nby the Euler values, these flows are never singular. Despite this, the\nNavier-Stokes $Z$ can, for a brief period, grow faster than the Euler $Z$ and\nthe following increase in the viscous energy dissipation rate $\\epsilon=\\nu Z$\nshows $\\nu$-independent convergence at $t\\approx 2t_x$.

In this work, we revisit its solutions, seeking,\nin particular, self-similar profiles. This problem connects to the classical\ntheory of special functions and, more specifically, to the Hermite as well as\nthe Kummer hypergeometric functions. Reconstructing the solution of the\noriginal diffusion model from novel self-similar solutions of the associated\nself-similar PDE, we infer that the $t^{-1/2}$ decay law of the diffusion\namplitude is {\\it not necessary}. In particular, it is possible to engineer\nsetups of {\\it both} the Cauchy problem and the initial-boundary value problem\nin which the solution decays at a {\\it different rate}. Nevertheless, we\nobserve that the $t^{-1/2}$ rate corresponds to the dominant decay mode among\nintegrable initial data, i.e., ones corresponding to finite mass. Hence, unless\nthe projection to such a mode is eliminated, generically this decay will be the\nslowest one observed. In initial-boundary value problems, an additional issue\nthat arises is whether the boundary data are \\textit{consonant} with the\ninitial data; namely, whether the boundary data agree at all times with the\nsolution of the Cauchy problem associated with the same initial data, when this\nsolution is evaluated at the boundary of the domain. In that case, the power\nlaw dictated by the solution of the Cauchy problem will be selected. On the\nother hand, in the non-consonant cases a decomposition of the problem into a\nself-similar and a non-self-similar one is seen to be beneficial in obtaining a\nsystematic understanding of the resulting solution. \n\n"}

By well-posedness in\nlow regularity Sobolev spaces we mean that less regularity than the one imposed\nby the energy methods is required (the energy methods do not exploit the\ndispersive properties of the linear part of the equation). In many cases these\nmethods to prove well-posedness in low regularity Sobolev spaces lead to\noptimal results in terms of the regularity of the initial data. By optimal we\nmean that if one requires slightly less regularity then the corresponding\nCauchy problem becomes ill-posed in the Hadamard sense. We call the Sobolev\nspaces in which these ill-posedness results hold spaces of supercritical\nregularity.\n  More recently, methods to prove probabilistic well-posedness in Sobolev\nspaces of supercritical regularity were developed. More precisely, by\nprobabilistic well-posedness we mean that one endows the corresponding Sobolev\nspace of supercritical regularity with a non degenerate probability measure and\nthen one shows that almost surely with respect to this measure one can define a\n(unique) global flow.

In\nthe compressible regime we consider, when pressure results from the cell\ndensities and when two different populations of cells are considered, a\nspecific difficulty arises from the hyperbolic character of the equation for\neach cell density, and to the parabolic aspect of the equation for the total\ncell density.

Therefore the existence of solutions is a difficult\nproblem.\n  Here, we establish the existence of weak solutions to the model with two cell\npopulations which react similarly to the pressure in terms of their motion but\nundergo different growth/death rates.

However, it is\nnot known whether it is possible to extend this method to construct nonunique\nsuitable weak solutions (that is weak solutions satisfying the strong energy\ninequality (SEI) and the local energy inequality (LEI)), Leray-Hopf weak\nsolutions (that is weak solutions satisfying the SEI), or at least to exclude\nenergy profiles that are not nonincreasing. In this paper we are concerned with\nweak solutions to the Navier-Stokes inequality on $\\mathbb{R}^3$, that is\nvector fields that satisfy both the SEI and the LEI (but not necessarily solve\nthe Navier-Stokes equations). Given $T>0$ and a nonincreasing energy profile\n$e\\colon [0,T] \\to [0,\\infty )$ we construct weak solution to the Navier-Stokes\ninequality that are localised in space and whose energy profile $\\| u(t)\\|_{L^2\n(\\mathbb{R}^3 )}$ stays arbitrarily close to $e(t)$ for all $t\\in [0,T]$.

The\nproblem involves two small parameters beta and rho where: (i) (1/beta) is a\nfactor describing spatial extension of the wavepackets; (ii) (1/rho) is a\nfactor describing the relative magnitude of the linear part of the evolution\nequation compared to its nonlinearity. For a wide range of the small parameters\nand on time intervals long enough for strong nonlinear effects we prove that\nmulti-wavepackets are preserved under the nonlinear evolution. In particular,\nthe corresponding wave vectors and the band numbers of involved wavepackets are\n\"conserved quantities\". We also prove that the evolution of a multi-wavepacket\nis described with high accuracy by a properly constructed system of envelope\nequations with a universal nonlinearity which in simpler cases turn into\nwell-known Nonlinear Schrodinger or coupled modes equations. The universal\nnonlinearity is obtained by a certain time averaging applied to the original\nnonlinearity. This can be viewed as an extension of the well known averaging\nmethod developed for finite-dimensional nonlinear oscillatory systems to the\ncase of a general translation invariant PDE systems with the linear part having\ncontinuous spectrum. \n\n"}
