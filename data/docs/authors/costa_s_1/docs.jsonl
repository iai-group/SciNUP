For very rapidly rotating black holes (spin\na=J/M>0.9524M) we have found a class of very strong field eccentric orbits\nwhose angular momentum L_z increases with the orbit's inclination with respect\nto the equatorial plane, while keeping latus rectum and eccentricity fixed.\nThis behavior is in contrast with Newtonian intuition, and is in fact opposite\nto the \"normal\" behavior of black hole orbits. Such behavior was noted\npreviously for circular orbits; since it only applies to orbits very close to\nthe black hole, they were named \"nearly horizon-skimming orbits\". Our analysis\ngeneralizes this result, mapping out the full generic (inclined and eccentric)\nfamily of nearly horizon-skimming orbits. The earlier work on circular orbits\nreported that, under gravitational radiation emission, nearly horizon-skimming\norbits tend to evolve to smaller orbit inclination, toward prograde equatorial\nconfiguration. Normal orbits, by contrast, always demonstrate slowly growing\norbit inclination (orbits evolve toward the retrograde equatorial\nconfiguration). Using up-to-date Teukolsky-fluxes, we have concluded that the\nearlier result was incorrect: all circular orbits, including nearly\nhorizon-skimming ones, exhibit growing orbit inclination. Using kludge fluxes\nbased on a Post-Newtonian expansion corrected with fits to circular and to\nequatorial Teukolsky-fluxes, we argue that the inclination grows also for\neccentric nearly horizon-skimming orbits. We also find that the inclination\nchange is, in any case, very small. As such, we conclude that these orbits are\nnot likely to have a clear and peculiar imprint on the gravitational waveforms\nexpected to be measured by the space-based detector LISA. \n\n"}

We analyze the spin evolution in three specific scenarios: (1) spin\nevolves only through mergers, (2) spin evolves through mergers and prolonged\naccretion episodes, (3) spin evolves through mergers and short-lived (chaotic)\naccretion episodes. We study how different diagnostics can distinguish between\nthese evolutionary scenarios, assessing the discriminating power of\ngravitational-wave measurements and X-ray spectroscopy. Gravitational radiation\ncan produce three different types of spin measurements, yielding respectively\nthe spins of the two black holes in a binary inspiral prior to merger, the spin\nof the merger remnant (as encoded in the ringdown waves), and the spin of\n``single'' black holes during the extreme mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI) of compact\nobjects.

In earlier work, we presented an accurate\n(2+1)D finite-difference time-domain code to solve the Teukolsky equation,\nwhich evolves curvature perturbations near rotating (Kerr) black holes.

These results should be of importance to various\nother fields, in particular, superstring theory and superconformal field\ntheory.\n  This new approach, which was actually first proposed by Molotkov and Schwarz\nand Voronov already in the mid-80s, is based on a consequent use of the functor\nof points.

{"id": "0904.4501", "contents": "Title: Extreme- and Intermediate-Mass Ratio Inspirals in Dynamical Chern-Simons\n  Modified Gravity Abstract: [abridged] Chern-Simons (CS) modified gravity is a 4D effective theory that\ndescends both from string theory and loop quantum gravity, and that corrects\nthe Einstein-Hilbert action by adding the product of a scalar field and the\nparity-violating, Pontryagin density. In this theory, the gravitational field\nof spinning black holes is described by a modified Kerr geometry whose\nmultipole moments deviate from the Kerr ones only at the fourth multipole, l =\n4. We investigate possible signatures of this theory in the gravitational wave\nemission produced in the inspiral of stellar compact objects into massive black\nholes, both for intermediate- and extreme-mass ratios. We use the\nsemi-relativistic approximation, where the trajectories are geodesics of the\nmassive black hole geometry and the gravitational waveforms are obtained from a\nmultipolar decomposition of the radiative field. The main CS corrections to the\nwaveforms arise from modifications to the geodesic trajectories, due to changes\nto the massive black hole geometry, and manifest themselves as an accumulating\ndephasing relative to the general relativistic case. We also explore the\npropagation and the stress-energy tensor of gravitational waves in this theory.\nWe find that, although this tensor has the same form as in General Relativity,\nthe energy and angular momentum balance laws are indeed modified through the\nstress-energy tensor of the CS scalar field. These balance laws could be used\nto describe the inspiral through adiabatic changes in the orbital parameters,\nwhich in turn would enhance the dephasing effect. Gravitational-wave\nobservations of intermediate- or extreme-mass ratio inspirals with advanced\nground detectors or with LISA could use such dephasing to test the dynamical\ntheory to unprecedented levels. \n\n"}

Its interaction with photon is an\neffective way to detect it, e.g., pseudoscalar-photon interaction will generate\nvacuum dichroism in a magnetic field. Motivated to measure the QED vacuum\nbirefringence and to detect pseudoscalar-photon interaction, we started to\nbuild up the Q & A experiment (QED [Quantum Electrodynamics] and Axion\nexperiment) in 1994. In this talk, we first give a brief historical account of\nplanet hunting and dark matter evidence.

It is therefore important to\ninclude General Relativistic effects. Here we provide a General Relativistic\ngeneralization of the bias, valid both for Gaussian and non-Gaussian initial\nconditions. The collapse of objects happens on very small scales, while\nlong-wavelength modes are always in the quasi linear regime. Around every\ncollapsing region, it is therefore possible to find a reference frame that is\nvalid for all times and where the space time is almost flat: the Fermi frame.\nHere the Newtonian approximation is applicable and the equations of motion are\nthe ones of the N-body codes. The effects of long-wavelength modes are encoded\nin the mapping from the cosmological frame to the local frame. For the linear\nbias, the effect of the long-wavelength modes on the dynamics is encoded in the\nlocal curvature of the Universe, which allows us to define a General\nRelativistic generalization of the bias in the standard Newtonian setting. We\nshow that the bias due to this effect goes to zero as the squared ratio of the\nphysical wavenumber with the Hubble scale for modes longer than the horizon, as\nmodes longer than the horizon have no dynamical effects. However, the bias due\nto non-Gaussianities does not need to vanish for modes longer than the Hubble\nscale, and for non-Gaussianities of the local kind it goes to a constant. As a\nfurther application, we show that it is not necessary to perform large N-body\nsimulations to extract information on long-wavelength modes: N-body simulations\ncan be done on small scales and long-wavelength modes are encoded simply by\nadding curvature to the simulation and rescaling the coordinates. \n\n"}

The\nexistence of these new operators can lead to interesting dynamics for the\nevolution of the universe, including the appearance of new vacuum states. If\nthe universe today exists in a false vacuum, there will be a non-zero\nprobability to tunnel to the true vacuum state of the universe. Should this\ntransition occur elsewhere in the universe, bubbles of true vacuum will\nnucleate and expand outwards. Bubbles that nucleate in the hot dense plasma of\nthe early universe will feel a friction from the plasma that acts against the\nexpansion of the bubble, until the bubble eventually reaches a steady state\nexpansion. Unlike many bubble formation scenarios where the bubble wall\nvelocity rapidly approaches the speed of light, friction from the hot\nprimordial plasma can cause the expanding bubble wall to reach a terminal\nvelocity while gravity waves are free to propagate through the hot dense plasma\nat the speed of light.

In this work we improve such an analysis removing some approximations\nthat have been implicitly used in our previous works and obtaining the\ncorrected expressions for the formulas of the horizon's area quantization and\nthe number of quanta of area and hence also for Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, its\nsub-leading corrections and the number of micro-states, i.e. quantities which\nare fundamental to realize the underlying quantum gravity theory, like\nfunctions of the QNMs quantum \"overtone\" number n and, in turn, of the BH\nquantum excited level.

Cosmological parameters Abstract: We present the first results based on Planck measurements of the CMB\ntemperature and lensing-potential power spectra.

In this model Planck data determine the\ncosmological parameters to high precision. We find a low value of the Hubble\nconstant, H0=67.3+/-1.2 km/s/Mpc and a high value of the matter density\nparameter, Omega_m=0.315+/-0.017 (+/-1 sigma errors) in excellent agreement\nwith constraints from baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) surveys. Including\ncurvature, we find that the Universe is consistent with spatial flatness to\npercent-level precision using Planck CMB data alone. We present results from an\nanalysis of extensions to the standard cosmology, using astrophysical data sets\nin addition to Planck and high-resolution CMB data. None of these models are\nfavoured significantly over standard LCDM. The deviation of the scalar spectral\nindex from unity is insensitive to the addition of tensor modes and to changes\nin the matter content of the Universe. We find a 95% upper limit of r<0.11 on\nthe tensor-to-scalar ratio. There is no evidence for additional neutrino-like\nrelativistic particles.

We introduce a factorization that considerably simplifies the spherical\nharmonic modes of the energy flux (and thus also the amplitudes of the\nspherical harmonic modes of the gravitational waves); it is likely that much of\nthe complexity this factorization removes is due to curved-space wave\npropagation (e.g., tail effects). For the modes with azimuthal number l of 7 or\ngreater, this factorization reduces the expressions for the modes that enter\nthe 22PN total energy flux to pure integer PN series with rational\ncoefficients, which amounts to a reduction of up to a factor of ~150 in the\ntotal number of terms in a given mode.

We examine the connection between\nthese two collider observables at the LHC and ILC in the 19/20-parameter\np(henomenological)MSSM. Within this scenario, we address two questions: (i) How\nwill potentially null direct searches for SUSY at the LHC influence the\npredicted properties of the lightest SUSY Higgs boson? (ii) What can be learned\nabout the properties of the superpartners from precision measurements of the\nHiggs boson couplings? In this paper, we examine these questions by employing\nthree different large sets of pMSSM models with either the neutralino or\ngravitino being the LSP. We make use of the ATLAS direct SUSY searches at the\n7/8 TeV LHC as well as expected results from 14 TeV operations, and the\nanticipated precision measurements of the Higgs Boson couplings at the 14 TeV\nLHC and at the ILC. We demonstrate that the future Higgs coupling\ndeterminations can deeply probe the pMSSM parameter space and, in particular,\ncan observe the effects of models that are projected to evade the direct\nsearches at the 14 TeV LHC with 3 inverse ab of integrated luminosity. In\naddition, we compare the reach of the Higgs coupling determinations to the\ndirect heavy Higgs searches in the MA - tan beta plane and show that they cover\northogonal regions.

The point in our prediction is, although the Unruh\neffect is only in the accelerating frame, if the appearance of the Brownian\nmotion rooted in the Unruh effect in the inertial frame can be predicted, the\nheat that the particle gets in its body by the Unruh effect in the accelerating\nframe could survive in the inertial frame.

It will be interesting to examine if these power\nspectra retain their shape after the bounce.

The agents responsible for mediating the MONDian force law are\nsuperfluid phonons that couple to ordinary (baryonic) matter. In this paper we\npropose an alternative way for the MOND phenomenon to emerge from DM\nsuperfluidity. The central idea is to use higher-gradient corrections in the\nsuperfluid effective theory. These next-to-leading order terms involve\ngradients of the gravitational potential, and therefore effectively modify the\ngravitational force law. In the process we discover a novel mechanism for\ngenerating the non-relativistic MOND action, starting from a theory that is\nfully analytic in all field variables. The idea, inspired by the symmetron\nmechanism, uses the spontaneous breaking of a discrete symmetry. For large\nacceleration, the symmetry is unbroken and the action reduces to Einstein\ngravity. For small acceleration, the symmetry is spontaneously broken and the\naction reduces to MONDian gravity. Cosmologically, however, the universe is\nalways in the Einstein-gravity, symmetry-restoring phase.

We extend the concept to\nstatic thermal gradients by recasting the temperature variation as a variation\nin the Euclidean metric. We apply this prescription to determine the Quark\nanti-Quark potential in a system with thermal gradient. A naturally occurring\nQCD medium with thermal gradients is a Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP). However, the\nQGP evolves in time. Hence, we use a quasi-stationary approximation, which is\napplicable only if the rate of time evolution is slow. The application of our\nproposal to a Quark anti-Quark potential in QGP can be seen as a step towards a\nmore exact theory which would incorporate time varying thermal gradients. The\neffect of a static temperature gradient on the Quark anti-Quark potential is\nanalyzed using a gravity dual model. A non-uniform black string metric is\ndeveloped, by perturbing the Schwarzchild metric, which allows to incorporate\nthe temperature gradient in the dual AdS space.

We derive a set of conditions on the\nfour free functions of the Horndeski action that examine whether a specific\nmodel embedded in the action possesses an Einstein gravity limit or not. For\nthis purpose, we develop a new and surprisingly simple scaling method that\nidentifies dominant terms in the equations of motion by considering formal\nlimits of the couplings that enter through the new terms in the modified\naction. This enables us to find regimes where nonlinear terms dominate and\nEinstein's field equations are recovered to leading order.

These systems are generally known as minisuperspace models. One of\ntheir important key features is the invariance of the corresponding reduced\nactions under reparametrizations of the independent variable, a fact that can\nbe seen as the remnant of the general covariance of the full theory. In the\ncase of a system of $n$ degrees of freedom, described by a Lagrangian quadratic\nin velocities, one can use the lapse by either gauge fixing it or letting it be\ndefined by the constraint and subsequently substitute into the rest of the\nequations. In the first case, the system is solvable for $n$ accelerations and\nthe constraint becomes a restriction among constants. In the second case, the\nsystem can only be solved for $n-1$ accelerations and the \"gauge\" freedom is\ntransferred to the choice of one of the scalar degrees of freedom. In this\npaper, we take the second path and express all $n-1$ scalar degrees of freedom\nin terms of the remaining one, say $q$.

If distance between the two black\nholes is below a certain threshold value, the system admits two photon spheres.\nAs in the case of single black hole, infinitely many relativistic images are\nformed due to the light rays which turn back from the region outside the outer\n(unstable) photon sphere, all of which lie beyond a critical angular radius\nwith respect to the lens.

One possibility\nwould be a spin-2 object called the colorphilic graviton--a spin-2\ncolor-singlet particle which couples exclusively to the quark and gluon\nstress-energy tensors. We assess the possibility of this state's discovery in\nthe dijet channel as an s-channel resonance, and report the regions of\nparameter space where colorphilic gravitons have not yet been excluded by\nLHC-13 data but still may be discovered in the dijet channel at LHC-14 for\nintegrated luminosities of 0.3, 1, and 3 ab$^{-1}$. We then delineate which of\nthose regions remain accessible to future collider searches, once one accounts\nfor applicability of the narrow-width approximation, detector mass resolution,\nand self-consistency according to tree-level partial-wave unitarity. We\ndiscover that--despite the strong constraints unitarity imposes on collider\nsearches--the colorphilic graviton remains potentially discoverable in the LHC\ndijet channel.

{"id": "1709.02537", "contents": "Title: The effective Tolman temperature in curved spacetimes Abstract: We review a recently proposed effective Tolman temperature and present its\napplications to various gravitational systems. In the Unruh state for the\nevaporating black holes, the free-fall energy density is found to be negative\ndivergent at the horizon, which is in contrast to the conventional calculations\nperformed in the Kruskal coordinates. We resolve this conflict by invoking that\nthe Kruskcal coordinates could be no longer proper coordinates at the horizon.\nIn the Hartle-Hawking-Israel state, despite the negative finite proper energy\ndensity at the horizon, the Tolman temperature is divergent there due to the\ninfinite blueshift of the Hawking temperature. However, a consistent\nStefan-Boltzmann law with the Hawking radiation shows that the effective Tolman\ntemperature is eventually finite everywhere and the equivalence principle is\nsurprisingly restored at the horizon. Then, we also show that the firewall\nnecessarily emerges out of the Unruh vacuum, so that the Tolman temperature in\nthe evaporating black hole is naturally divergent due to the infinitely\nblueshifted negative ingoing flux crossing the horizon, whereas the outgoing\nHawking radiation characterized by the effective Tolman temperature indeed\noriginates from the quantum atmosphere, not just at the horizon. So, the\nfirewall and the atmosphere for the Hawking radiation turn out to be\ncompatible, once we discard the fact that the Hawking radiation in the Unruh\nstate originates from the infinitely blueshifted outgoing excitations at the\nhorizon. Finally, as a cosmological application, the initial radiation energy\ndensity in warm inflation scenarios has been assumed to be finite when\ninflation starts. We successfully find the origin of the non-vanishing initial\nradiation energy density in the warm inflation by using the effective Tolman\ntemperature. \n\n"}

In other\nwords, if the integrand of the momentum integral for these two-point functions\nbehaves like $p^{-2\\nu}$, where $p$ is the momentum, in the infrared, then it\ncan be made to behave like $p^{-2\\nu+2}$ by large gauge transformations.

Gravitation is then\nconformally-related to the standard model via a conformal transformation,\nmerely a function of the number of fermionic particles dominating the energy\ndensity associated with the ground state of the physical system. Doing so\nresolves major puzzles afflicting the standard models of particle physics and\ncosmology, clearly indicating these to be artifacts stemming from universally\nemploying the system of units selected here and now. In addition to the three\nknown fundamental interactions mediated by gauge bosons, a scalar-tensor\ninteraction is also accommodated by the theory; its inertial and gravitational\nsectors are characterized by whether contributions to the Weyl tensor vanish or\nare finite, respectively. In this approach both inertia and gravity are viewed\nas collective phenomena, with characteristic gravitational Planck scale devoid\nof fundamental meaning; consequently, mass hierarchy and Higgs mass instability\nconcerns are avoided altogether. Only standard model particles gravitate; dark\nmatter and dark energy have an inertial origin, and since the Higgs field does\nnot interact with photons it is an ideal candidate for explaining the dark\nsector of cosmology. On cosmological scales the dynamical vacuum-like Higgs\nself-coupling accounts for dark energy, and its observed proximity at present\nto the energy density of nonrelativistic matter is merely a consistency\nrequirement.

We present the first detailed study of highly eccentric BNS\nsystems with full (3+1)D numerical relativity simulations using consistent\ninitial conditions, i.e., setups which are in agreement with the Einstein\nequations and with the equations of general relativistic hydrodynamics in\nequilibrium.

One such connection is the\nability to derive gravitational field equations from entanglement identities.

Since\nthe moment of inertia tensor is inherently triaxial in a magnetic star, the\nprecession is periodic but not sinusoidal in time, in agreement with\nobservations of PSR 1828-11. However, the problem we consider is {\\it not} just\nprecession of a triaxial body.

The initial SMS of\narbitrary mass M in these simulations rotates uniformly at the mass--shedding\nlimit and is marginally unstable to radial collapse. The final black hole has\nmass M_h/M = 0.9 and and spin J_h/M_h^2 = 0.75, approximately. The remaining\nmass goes into a disk of mass M_disk/M = 0.1, also approximately.

In order to achieve this level of\nsignal-to-noise, the systematic anisotropies in the survey must be below ~ 0.1\n%, on the scale of ~ 10 degrees on the sky, while the systematic error in\nredshift estimates must be less than 0.05.\n  Then, we argue that, while an ISW detection will not be a good way of\nconstraining the conventional properties of dark energy, it could be a valuable\nmeans of testing alternative theories of gravity on large physical scales. \n\n"}

In order to identify the origins of these constraints,\nthe equations of motion of the brane-world are translated to the most general,\nmodel-independent (or \"covariant\"), formulation of the theory, based only on\nthe Einstein-Hilbert action for the bulk geometry, the confinement of the\nstandard gauge interactions and the exclusive probing of the extra dimensions\nby the gravitational field. In the case of the binary pulsar PSR1913+16, it is\nfound that gravi-vectors and gravi-scalars do not appear in the covariant\nequations, but they are replaced by vector and scalar fields related to the\nextrinsic curvature of the brane-world. Only the latter one impose a condition\non the binary pulsar orbits. A general solution for this problem is proposed,\nbased on results from differential geometry, suggesting a stable bulk geometry,\nwhose existence requires higher dimensions. On the cosmological scale, it is\nshown that the high energy inflation constraint originating from the square of\nthe energy density term in the modified Friedman's equation is mainly due to\nthe assumption of the reflection symmetry across the brane-world.

Recently it was shown that Randall-Sundrum type braneworld inflation\nleads to tighter constraints on quadratic and quartic potentials than in\ngeneral relativity.

Clearly, this formula requires amendments, as it predicts an\ninfinitely large monopole C_0, and a dipole moment C_1 only 6/2 times larger\nthan the quadrupole C_2, both predictions in conflict with observations.

At the same time, the\nfunction l(l +1)C_l deviates from a horizontal line and grows with l, for l\n\\geq 2.

Abstract: We consider the hypothesis that quantum mechanics is an approximation to\nanother, cosmological theory, accurate only for the description of subsystems\nof the universe. Quantum theory is then to be derived from the cosmological\ntheory by averaging over variables which are not internal to the subsystem,\nwhich may be considered non-local hidden variables. We find conditions for\narriving at quantum mechanics through such a procedure. The key lesson is that\nthe effect of the coupling to the external degrees of freedom introduces noise\ninto the evolution of the system degrees of freedom, while preserving a notion\nof averaged conserved energy and time reversal invariance.\n  These conditions imply that the effective description of the subsystem is\nNelson's stochastic formulation of quantum theory. We show that Nelson's\nformulation is not, by itself, a classical stochastic theory as the conserved\naveraged energy is not a linear function of the probability density. We also\ninvestigate an argument of Wallstrom posed against the equivalence of Nelson's\nstochastic mechanics and quantum mechanics and show that, at least for a simple\ncase, it is in error. \n\n"}

The starting point is their\ndescription in terms of a covariant positive-operator-valued measure on the\n  Minkowski space-time. Besides the usual uncertainty relations, we find\nstronger inequalities involving the mass and the centre-of-mass angular\nmomentum of the object that defines the event. We suggest that these\ninequalities may help to clarify some of the arguments which have been given in\nfavour of a gravitational quantum limit to the accuracy of time and space\nmeasurements. \n\n"}
