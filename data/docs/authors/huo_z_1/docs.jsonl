We also present estimates of the fraction of cores in the\n\"prestellar\", \"stellar'', and \"failed\" (those cores that redisperse back into\nthe environment) stages as a function of n_thr. The number ratios are measured\nindirectly in the simulations due to their resolution limitations. Our approach\ncontains one free parameter, the lifetime of a protostellar object t_yso (Class\n0 + Class I stages), which is outside the realm of the simulations. Assuming a\nvalue t_yso = 0.46 Myr, we obtain number ratios of starless to stellar cores\nranging from 4-5 at n_thr = 1.5 x 10^4 cm^-3 to 1 at n_thr = 1.2 x 10^5 cm^-3,\nagain in good agreement with observational determinations.

The new radio data\nconfirm the triple radio structure with a central core and two resolved radio\nlobes. This implies that the previously detected fast outflow of neutral gas is\noccurring off-nucleus, near a radio lobe about 0.5 kpc from the core. The\nionised gas shows complex kinematics in the region co-spatial with the radio\nemission. Broad and blueshifted (~ 500 km/s) emission is observed in the region\nof the radio lobe, at the same location as the blueshifted HI absorption. The\nvelocity of the ionised outflow is similar to the one found in HI. The first\norder correspondence between the radio and optical properties suggests that the\noutflow is driven by the interaction between the radio jet and the ISM. Despite\nthe high outflow velocities, no evidence is found for the ionisation of the gas\nbeing due to fast shocks in the region of the outflow, indicating that\nphotoionisation from the AGN is likely to be the dominant ionisation mechanism.\nThe outflow rate of the warm (ionised) gas is small compared to that of the\ncold gas.

This is\nparticularly motivated by recent indications from HYMORS. Exploiting high\nresolution, numerical simulations, we demonstrate that for both high and low\nenergy jets, always at high Lorentz factor, a transition to a higher density\nenvironment can cause a significant fraction of the directed jet energy to be\nlost on reflection. This can explain how one-sided jet deceleration and a\ntransition to FR I type can occur in HYMORS, which start as FR II (and remain\nso on the other side). For that purpose, we implemented in the relativistic\nhydrodynamic grid-adaptive AMRVAC code, the Synge-type equation of state\nintroduced in the general polytropic case by Meliani et al. (2004).

One method employs a direct fit to a modified\nblackbody SED; the other involves a comparison of flux ratios to an analytical\nprediction. Fitting fluxes near the SED peak produces inaccurate temperature\nand dust spectral index estimates due to the line of sight temperature (and\ndensity) variations. Longer wavelength fluxes in the Rayleigh-Jeans part of the\nspectrum (>~ 600 micron for typical cores) may more accurately recover the\nspectral index, but both methods are very sensitive to noise. The temperature\nestimate approaches the density weighted temperature, or \"column temperature,\"\nof the source as short wavelength fluxes are excluded. An inverse temperature -\nspectral index correlation naturally results from SED fitting, due to the\ninaccurate isothermal assumption, as well as noise uncertainties. We show that\nabove some \"threshold\" temperature, the temperatures estimated through the flux\nratio method can be highly inaccurate. In general, observations with widely\nseparated wavelengths, and including shorter wavelengths, result in higher\nthreshold temperatures; such observations thus allow for more accurate\ntemperature estimates of sources with temperatures less than the threshold\ntemperature.

If this is interpreted as an age\nspread, the multiple populations are separated by a few hundred Myr, which\nwould call into question the long held notion that clusters are simple stellar\npopulations. Here we show that stellar rotation in stars with masses between\n1.2-1.7 Msun can mimic the effect of a double or multiple population, whereas\nin actuality only a single population exists.

We derive the\nluminosity indicators from the light curves and spectra of each burst,\nincluding the lag time between low and high photon energy light curves, the\nvariability of the light curve, the peak energy of the spectrum, the number of\npeaks in the light curve, and the minimum rise time of the peaks. These\nluminosity indicators can each be related directly to the luminosity, and we\ncombine their independent luminosities into one weighted average. Then with our\ncombined luminosity value, the observed burst peak brightness, and the\nconcordance redshift-distance relation, we can derive the redshift for each\nburst. In this paper, we test the accuracy of our method on 107 bursts with\nknown spectroscopic redshift. The reduced $\\chi^2$ of our best redshifts\n($z_{best}$) compared with known spectroscopic redshifts ($z_{spec}$) is 0.86,\nand the average value of $log_{10}(z_{best}/z_{spec})$ is 0.01, with this\nindicating that our error bars are good and our estimates are not biased. The\nRMS scatter of $log_{10}(z_{best}/z_{spec})$ is 0.26.

The\nother is a radially dependent IMF, as presently observed in the Arches. We find\nthat it is unlikely for the Arches to have attained the observed degree of mass\nsegregation at its current age starting from a standard non-segregated Kroupa\nIMF. We also study the possibility of a collisional runaway developing in the\nfirst $\\sim 2-3 \\rm{Myr}$ of dynamical evolution. We find that the evolution of\nthis cluster is dramatically different depending on the choice of IMF: if a\nprimordially mass segregated IMF is chosen, a collisional runaway should always\noccur between $2-3 \\rm{Myr}$ for a broad range of initial concentrations. In\ncontrast, for a standard Kroupa IMF no collisional runaway is predicted. We\nargue that if Arches was created with a mass segregated IMF similar to what is\nobserved today then at the current cluster age a very unusual, high-mass star\nshould be created. However, whether a collisional runaway leads to the\nformation of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) depends strongly on the\nmass loss rate via winds from massive stars.

This explicitly model-dependent approach is based on\nreadily-available observations, and results in small formal errors. Here I use\ntwo calibration samples of stars (eclipsing binaries and stars for which\nasteroseismic analyses are available) having well-determined masses and radii\nto estimate the accuracy and systematic errors inherent in the rho_* method.\nWhen matching to the Yonsei-Yale stellar evolution models, I find the most\nimportant systematic error results from selection bias favoring\nrapidly-rotating (hence probably magnetically active) stars among the eclipsing\nbinary sample. If unaccounted for, this bias leads to a mass-dependent\nunderestimate of stellar radii by as much as 4% for stars of 0.4 M_sun,\ndecreasing to zero for masses above about 1.4 M_sun. The asteroseismic sample\nsuggests (albeit with significant uncertainty) that systematic errors are small\nfor slowly-rotating, inactive stars. Systematic errors arising from failings of\nthe Yonsei-Yale models of inactive stars probably exist, but are difficult to\nassess because of the small number of well-characterized comparison stars\nhaving low mass and slow rotation. Poor information about [Z] is an important\nsource of random error, and may be a minor source of systematic error as well.\nWith suitable corrections for rotation, it is likely that systematic errors in\nthe rho_* method can be comparable to or smaller than the random errors,\nyielding radii that are accurate to about 2% for most stars. \n\n"}

The imposed \"stirring\" crudely approximates the effects of\ngalactic wakes, waves generated by galaxies moving through the intracluster\nmedium (ICM), and/or turbulence produced by a central active galactic nucleus.\nThe simulated clusters exhibit a strong bimodality. Modest levels of\nturbulence, ~100 km/s (~10% of the sound speed), suppress the heat-flux-driven\nbuoyancy instability (HBI), resulting in an isotropically tangled magnetic\nfield and a quasi-stable, high entropy, thermal equilibrium with no cooling\ncatastrophe. Thermal conduction dominates the heating of the cluster core, but\nturbulent mixing is critical because it suppresses the HBI and (to a lesser\nextent) the thermal instability.

{"id": "1004.3874", "contents": "Title: Loss of halo triaxiality due to bar formation Abstract: Cosmological N-body simulations indicate that the dark matter haloes of\ngalaxies should be generally triaxial. Yet, the presence of a baryonic disc is\nbelieved to alter the shape of the haloes. Here we aim to study how bar\nformation is affected by halo triaxiality and how, in turn, the presence of the\nbar influences the shape of the halo. We perform a set of collisionless N-body\nsimulations of disc galaxies with triaxial dark matter haloes, using elliptical\ndiscs as initial conditions. We study models of different halo triaxialities\nand, to investigate the behaviour of the halo shape in the absence of bar\nformation, we run models with different disc masses, halo concentrations, disc\nvelocity dispersions and also models where the disc shape is kept artificially\naxisymmetric. We find that the introduction of a massive disc causes the halo\ntriaxiality to be partially diluted. Once the disc is fully grown, a strong\nstellar bar develops within the halo that is still non-axisymmetric, causing it\nto lose its remaining non-axisymmetry. In triaxial haloes in which the initial\nconditions are such that a bar does not form, the halo is able to remain\ntriaxial and the circularisation of its shape on the plane of the disc is\nlimited to the period of disc growth. We conclude that part of the\ncircularisation of the halo is due to disc growth, but part must be attributed\nto the formation of a bar. We find that initially circular discs respond\nexcessively to the triaxial potential and become highly elongated. They also\nlose more angular momentum than the initially elliptical discs and thus form\nstronger bars. Because of that, the circularisation that their bars induce on\ntheir haloes is also more rapid.

OGLE-II\n  SMC data Abstract: The primary goal of this paper is to provide the evidence that can either\nprove or falsify the hypothesis that dark matter in the Galactic halo can clump\ninto stellar-mass compact objects. If such objects existed, they would act as\nlenses to external sources in the Magellanic Clouds, giving rise to an\nobservable effect of microlensing. We present the results of our search for\nsuch events, based on the data from the second phase of the OGLE survey\n(1996-2000) towards the SMC. The data set we used is comprised of 2.1 million\nmonitored sources distributed over an area of 2.4 square degrees. We found only\none microlensing event candidate, however its poor quality light curve limited\nour discussion on the exact distance to the lensing object.\n  Given a single event, taking the blending (crowding of stars) into account\nfor the detection efficiency simulations, and deriving the HST-corrected number\nof monitored stars, the microlensing optical depth is tau=(1.55+-1.55)10e-7.\nThis result is consistent with the expected SMC self-lensing signal, with no\nneed of introducing dark matter microlenses.

Through the inclusion of Milgrom's acceleration constant into a\ngravitational theory, we show that very general formulas can be constructed for\nthe acceleration felt by a particle. Dimensional analysis shows that this\ninclusion naturally leads to the appearance of a mass-length scale in gravity,\nbreaking its scale invariance. A particular form of the modified gravitational\nforce is constructed and tested for consistency with observations over a wide\nrange of astrophysical environments, from solar system to extragalactic scales.\nWe show that over any limited range of physical parameters, which define a\nspecific class of astrophysical objects, the dispersion velocity of a system\nmust be a power law of its mass and size.

The molecular composition of the\ntwo outflows presents systematic changes with velocity that we analyze by\ndividing the outflow in three chemical regimes, two of them associated with the\nwing component and the other the EHV gas. The analysis of the two wing regimes\nshows that species like H2CO and CH3OH favor the low-velocity gas, while SiO\nand HCN are more abundant in the fastest gas. We also find that the EHV regime\nis relatively rich in O-bearing species, as is not only detected in CO and SiO\n(already reported elsewhere), but also in SO, CH3OH, and H2CO (newly reported\nhere), with a tentative detection in HCO+.

Aims: To study the effects of cosmic ray ion (H, He, CNO and\nFe-Co-Ni) and electron bombardment of PAHs in galactic and extragalactic\nenvironments. Methods: We calculate the nuclear and electronic interactions for\ncollisions between PAHs and cosmic ray ions and electrons with energies between\n5 MeV/nucleon and 10 GeV, above the threshold for carbon atom loss, in normal\ngalaxies, starburst galaxies and cooling flow galaxy clusters. Results: The\ntimescale for PAH destruction by cosmic ray ions depends on the electronic\nexcitation energy Eo and on the amount of energy available for dissociation.\nSmall PAHs are destroyed faster, with He and the CNO group being the more\neffective projectiles. For electron collisions, the lifetime is independent of\nthe PAH size and varies with the threshold energy To. Conclusions: Cosmic rays\nprocess the PAHs in diffuse clouds, where the destruction due to interstellar\nshocks is less efficient.

Our scenario divides GCs into\nthree groups, depending on the initial mass (M_I) of the progenitor structure\n(PS), as follows. i) Massive PSs can retain the gas ejected by massive stars,\nincluding the ejecta of core-collapse SNe. ii) Intermediate-mass PSs can retain\nat least a fraction of the fast winds of massive stars, but none of the\ncore-collapse SNe ejecta. iii) Low-mass PSs can only retain the slow winds of\nintermediate-mass stars. Members of the first group would include omega\nCentauri (NGC 5139), M54 (NGC 6715), M22 (NGC 6656), and Terzan 5, whereas NGC\n2808 (and possibly NGC 2419) would be members of the second group.

More\nspecifically, we consider Dehnen models built with the Schwarzschild method. We\nshow that short-term stability depends on the degree of velocity anisotropy\n(radially anisotropic models are subject to rapid development of radial-orbit\ninstability). Long-term stability, on the other hand, depends mainly on the\nproperties of the potential, and in particular, on whether it admits a\nsubstantial fraction of strongly chaotic orbits. We show that in the case of a\nweak density cusp (gamma=1 Dehnen model) the N-body model is remarkably stable,\nwhile the strong-cusp (gamma=2) model exhibits substantial evolution of shape\naway from triaxiality, which we attribute to the effect of chaotic diffusion of\norbits. The different behaviour of these two cases originates from the\ndifferent phase space structure of the potential; in the weak-cusp case there\nexist numerous resonant orbit families that impede chaotic diffusion. We also\nfind that it is hardly possible to affect the rate of this evolution by\naltering the fraction of chaotic orbits in the Schwarzschild model, which is\nexplained by the fact that the chaotic properties of an orbit are not preserved\nby the N-body evolution. There are, however, parameters in Schwarzschild\nmodelling that do affect the stability of an N-body model, so we discuss the\nrecipes how to build a `good' Schwarzschild model. \n\n"}

The disk is proposed to\nhave formed when a stellar black hole flew by the star, tidally disrupted its\nenvelope, and placed the star on its present orbit with some of the tidal\ndebris forming a disk. A disrupting encounter at the location of the observed\ncloud is most likely to be caused by a stellar black hole because of the\nexpected dynamical mass segregation; the rate of these disk-forming encounters\nmay be as high as $\\sim 10^{-6}$ per year. The star should also be spun up by\nthe encounter, so the disk may subsequently expand by absorbing angular\nmomentum from the star. Once the disk expands up to the tidal truncation\nradius, the tidal perturbation of the outer disk edge at every peribothron may\nplace gas streams on larger orbits which can give rise to a photoevaporation\nwind that forms the cloud at every orbit. This model predicts that, after the\ncloud is disrupted at the next peribothron passage in 2013, a smaller\nunresolved cloud will gradually grow around the star on the same present orbit.\nAn increased infrared luminosity from the disk may also be detectable when the\nperibothron is reached.

A fraction of these are\nlikely to be members of binaries. Here we discuss the binary population of\nstellar black holes and neutron stars near SMBHs and focus on the secular\nevolution of such binaries, due to the perturbation by the SMBH. Binaries with\nhighly inclined orbits in respect to their orbit around the SMBH are strongly\naffected by secular Kozai processes, which periodically change their\neccentricities and inclinations (Kozai-cycles). During periapsis approach, at\nthe highest eccentricities during the Kozai-cycles, gravitational wave emission\nbecomes highly efficient. Some binaries in this environment can inspiral and\ncoalesce at timescales much shorter than a Hubble time and much shorter than\nsimilar binaries which do not reside near a SMBH. The close environment of\nSMBHs could therefore serve as catalyst for the inspiral and coalescence of\nbinaries, and strongly affect their orbital properties. Such compact binaries\nwould be detectable as gravitational wave (GW) sources by the next generation\nof GW detectors (e.g. advanced- LIGO). About 0.5% of such nuclear merging\nbinaries will enter the LIGO observational window while on orbit that are still\nvery eccentric (e>~0.5). The efficient gravitational wave analysis for such\nsystems would therefore require the use of eccentric templates. We also find\nthat binaries very close to the MBH could evolve through a complex dynamical\n(non-secular) evolution leading to emission of several GW pulses during only a\nfew yrs (though these are likely to be rare). Finally, we note that the\nformation of close stellar binaries, X-ray binaries and their merger products\ncould be induced by similar secular processes, combined with tidal friction\nrather than GW emission as in the case of compact object binaries. \n\n"}

We explore general properties of circumbinary disks by reformulating\nstandard equations for the viscous disk evolution in terms of the viscous\nangular momentum flux F_J. In steady state F_J is a linear function of the\nspecific angular momentum, which is a generalization of (but is not equivalent\nto) the standard constant \\dot M disk solution. If the torque produced by the\ncentral binary is effective at stopping gas inflow and opening a gap (or\ncavity) in the disk, then the inner part of the circumbinary disk can be\napproximated as a constant F_J disk. We compute properties of such disks in\ndifferent physical regimes relevant for SMBH binaries and use these results to\nunderstand the gas-assisted evolution of SMBH pairs starting at separations\n10^{-4}-10^{-2} pc. We find the following. (1) Pile-up of matter at the inner\nedge of the disk leads to continuous growth of the torque acting on the binary\nand can considerably accelerate its orbital evolution compared to the\ngravitational wave-driven decay. (2) Torque on the binary is determined\nnon-locally and does not in general reflect the disk properties in the vicinity\nof the binary.

Adaptive optics imaging in the NIR (VLT/NaCo) together with diffraction\nlimited imaging in the mid-IR (VLT/VISIR) permit us to isolate the nuclear\nemission for some of the nearest LLAGNs in the Southern Hemisphere. These data\nwere extended to the optical/UV range (HST), radio (VLA, VLBI) and X-rays\n(Chandra, XMM-Newton, Integral), in order to build a genuine spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) for each AGN with a consistent spatial resolution (< 0.5\")\nacross the whole spectral range. From the individual SEDs, we construct an\naverage SED for LLAGNs sampled in all the wavebands mentioned before. Compared\nwith previous multiwavelength studies of LLAGNs, this work covers the mid-IR\nand NIR ranges with high-spatial resolution data. The LLAGNs in the sample\npresent a large diversity in terms of SED shapes. Some of them are very well\ndescribed by a self-absorbed synchrotron (e.g. NGC 1052), while some other\npresent a thermal-like bump at ~1 micron (NGC 4594). All of them are\nsignificantly different when compared with bright Seyferts and quasars,\nsuggesting that the inner structure of AGNs (i.e. the torus and the accretion\ndisk) suffers intrinsic changes at low luminosities. \n\n"}

Spectra of 401 red giant stars in a field at\n(l,b)=(0{\\deg},-10{\\deg}) were obtained with FLAMES at the VLT. Stars of\nluminosities down to below the two bulge red clumps (RCs) are included.

These measurements as\nwell as photometric data are compared to simulations with the Besancon and\nTRILEGAL models of the Galaxy. We confirm the presence of two populations among\nour sample stars: i) a metal-rich one at [M/H] ~+0.3, comprising about 30% of\nthe sample, with low RV dispersion and low alpha-abundance, and ii) a\nmetal-poor population at [M/H] ~-0.6 with high RV dispersion and high\nalpha-abundance.

Once the proximate AGN field turns on,\nadditional photo-ionisation rapidly ionises the HI and metals. The enhanced AGN\nradiation field turns off after a typical AGN lifetime (tau_AGN=1-20 Myr) and\nthe field returns to the EGB intensity, but the metals remain out of ionisation\nequilibrium for timescales that can significantly exceed tau_AGN. We define\nthis phase as the AGN proximity zone \"fossil\" phase and show that high\nionisation stages (e.g. OVI, NeVIII, MgX) are in general enhanced, while the\nabundances of low ions are reduced. In contrast, HI re-equilibrates rapidly\n(<<tau_AGN) owing to its low neutral fraction at diffuse densities.

While the\nspectrum, intensity, and angular distribution of this signal is in good\nagreement with predictions from annihilating dark matter, it has also been\nsuggested that a population of unresolved millisecond pulsars could be\nresponsible for this excess GeV emission from the Inner Galaxy.

This discussion investigates the possible\norigins of four Local Group planes: the plane similar, but not identical to\nthat identified by PAndAS, an adjacent slightly tilted plane, and two planes\nnear the Milky Way: one with nearer galaxies and the other with more distant\nones. Plausible orbits are found by using a combination of Numerical Action\nmethods and a backward in time integration procedure. For M31, M33, IC10, and\nLeoI, solutions are found that are consistent with measurements of their proper\nmotions. For galaxies in planes, there must be commonalities in their proper\nmotions, and this constraint greatly limits the number of physically plausible\nsolutions.

Until recently, no progenitor has\nbeen directly detected for SN of type Ibc, which are believed to come from\nmassive stars that lose their hydrogen envelope through stellar winds and from\nbinary systems where the companion has stripped the H envelope from the\nprimary.

Very interestingly, the recently published Geneva models\nof single stars can reproduce the observed photometry of the progenitor\ncandidate and its mass-loss rate, confirming a recently proposed scenario.

The progenitor likely has a\nluminosity of log (L/Lsun)~5.55, surface temperature ~45000 K, and mass of\n~10.9 Msun at the time of explosion. Our non-rotating 32 Msun model\noverestimates the derived radius of the progenitor, although this could likely\nbe reconciled with a fine-tuned model of a more massive (between 40 and 50\nMsun), hotter, and luminous progenitor.

For 4 sources infall takes place on core to envelope scales (i.e.\n~10000-3000 AU). In 2 sources the inverse P-Cygni profiles seen in the\nground-state lines are more likely due to larger-scale motions or foreground\nclouds.

Within the context of this picture, significant\norbital obliquities characteristic of a substantial fraction of such planets\ncan be attributed to external torques that perturb the disks out of alignment\nwith the spin axes of their host stars. Therefore, the acquisition of orbital\nobliquity exhibits sensitive dependence on the physics of disk-star\ninteractions.

We begin by calculating the stellar pre-main sequence rotational\nevolution, accounting for spin-up due to gravitational contraction and\naccretion as well as spin-down due to magnetic star-disk coupling. We devote\nparticular attention to angular momentum transfer by accretion, and show that\nwhile generally subdominant to gravitational contraction, this process is\nlargely controlled by the morphology of the stellar magnetic field (i.e.\nspecific angular momentum accreted by stars with octupole-dominated surface\nfields is smaller than that accreted by dipole-dominated stars by an order of\nmagnitude).

Abstract: We characterize the bulge, disk, and halo subcomponents in the Andromeda\ngalaxy (M31) over the radial range 4 < R_proj < 225 kpc. The cospatial nature\nof these subcomponents renders them difficult to disentangle using surface\nbrightness (SB) information alone, especially interior to ~20 kpc. Our new\ndecomposition technique combines information from the luminosity function (LF)\nof over 1.5 million bright (20 < m_814W < 22) stars from the Panchromatic\nHubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey, radial velocities of over 5000 red\ngiant branch stars in the same magnitude range from the Spectroscopic and\nPhotometric Landscape of Andromeda's Stellar Halo (SPLASH) survey, and\nintegrated I-band SB profiles from various sources. We use an affine-invariant\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to fit an appropriate toy model to these\nthree data sets. The bulge, disk, and halo SB profiles are modeled as a Sersic,\nexponential, and cored power-law, respectively, and the LFs are modeled as\nbroken power-laws. We present probability distributions for each of 32\nparameters describing the SB profiles and LFs of the three subcomponents. We\nfind that the number of stars with a disk-like LF is ~5% larger than the the\nnumber with disk-like (dynamically cold) kinematics, suggesting that some stars\nborn in the disk have been dynamically heated to the point that they are\nkinematically indistinguishable from halo members. This is the first\nkinematical evidence for a \"kicked-up disk\" halo population in M31. The\nfraction of kicked-up disk stars is consistent with that found in simulations.\nWe also find evidence for a radially varying disk LF, consistent with a\nnegative metallicity gradient in the stellar disk. \n\n"}

Converting these observations to an estimate of the CO J=1-0 intensity,\nand thus inferring H2 gas masses, requires knowledge of the CO excitation\nladder, or spectral line energy distribution (SLED). The few available multi-J\nCO observations of galaxies show a very broad range of SLEDs, even at fixed\ngalaxy mass and star formation rate, making the conversion to J=1-0 emission\nand hence molecular gas mass highly uncertain. Here, we combine numerical\nsimulations of disk galaxies and galaxy mergers with molecular line radiative\ntransfer calculations to develop a model for the physical parameters that drive\nvariations in CO SLEDs in galaxies. An essential feature of our model is a\nfully self-consistent computation of the molecular gas temperature and\nexcitation structure.

Here we show\nthat even if dust formation in the first supernovae is less efficient or strong\ndust destruction does occur, grain growth during the collapse of the parent gas\ncloud is sufficiently rapid to activate dust cooling and likely fragmentation\ninto low-mass and long-lived stars. Silicates and magnetite grains can\nexperience significant grain growth in the density range 10^9 /cc < nH<10^12\n/cc by accreting gas-phase species (SiO, SiO2, and Fe) until their gas-phase\nabundance drops to zero, reaching condensation efficiencies =1. The\ncorresponding increase in the dust-to-gas mass ratio allows dust-induced\ncooling and fragmentation to be activated at 10^12 /cc < nH < 10^14 /cc, before\nthe collapsing cloud becomes optically thick to continuum radiation.

The SFR-dependence of the slope of the TH-IGIMF is found to be key\nto reproducing the correct [a/Fe]-stellar mass relation. Massive galaxies reach\nhigher [a/Fe] abundance ratios because they are characterized by more top-heavy\nIMFs as a result of their higher SFR. As a consequence of our analysis, the\nvalue of the minimum embedded star cluster mass and of the slope of the\nembedded cluster mass function, which are free parameters involved in the\nTH-IGIMF theory, are found to be as low as 5 solar masses and 2, respectively.\nA mild downsizing trend is present for galaxies generated assuming either a\nuniversal IMF or a variable TH-IGIMF.

Finally, we have compared our SFR(UV) to the SFRs derived by stacking\nthe radio data and to those derived from the H$\\alpha$ luminosity of a sample\nof star-forming galaxies at $1.4<z<1.7$.

While techniques for detecting\nexoplanets yield properties of the planet only as a function of the properties\nof the host star, hence, we must accurately determine parameters of EH stars at\nfirst. For this reason, we constructed a grid of stellar models including\ndiffusion and rotation-induced extra-mixing with given ranges of input\nparameters (i.e. mass, metallicity, and initial rotation rate). In addition to\nthe commonly used observational constraints such as the effective temperature\nT_{eff}, luminosity L and metallicity [Fe/H], we added two observational\nconstraints, the lithium abundance log N (Li) and the rotational period\nP_{rot}. These two additional observed parameters can make further constrains\non the model due to their correlations with mass, age and other stellar\nproperties. Hence, our estimations of fundamental parameters for these EH stars\nand their planets are with higher precision than previous works. Therefore, the\ncombination of rotational period and lithium help us to obtain more accurate\nparameters for stars, leading to an improvement of the knowledge of the\nphysical state about the EH stars and their planets. \n\n"}

Despite their importance, we have not been able to fully\nquantify the impact of jets and outflows during the formation of a star\ncluster. The main problem lies in limited computing power. We would have to\nresolve the magnetic jet-launching mechanism close to the protostar and at the\nsame time follow the evolution of a parsec-size cloud for a million years.\nCurrent computer power and codes fall orders of magnitude short of achieving\nthis. In order to overcome this problem, we implement a subgrid-scale (SGS)\nmodel for launching jets and outflows, which demonstrably converges and\nreproduces the mass, linear and angular momentum transfer, and the speed of\nreal jets, with ~ 1000 times lower resolution than would be required without\nSGS model. We apply the new SGS model to turbulent, magnetized star cluster\nformation and show that jets and outflows (1) eject about 1/4 of their parent\nmolecular clump in high-speed jets, quickly reaching distances of more than a\nparsec, (2) reduce the star formation rate by about a factor of two, and (3)\nlead to the formation of ~ 1.5 times as many stars compared to the no-outflow\ncase. Most importantly, we find that jets and outflows reduce the average star\nmass by a factor of ~ 3 and may thus be essential for understanding the\ncharacteristic mass of the stellar initial mass function. \n\n"}

We use a well-defined and homogeneous sample of spiral host galaxies\nof 692 SNe from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey in different stages of\ngalaxy-galaxy interaction and activity classes of nucleus. We propose that the\nunderlying mechanisms shaping the number ratios of SNe types can be interpreted\nwithin the framework of interaction-induced star formation, in addition to the\nknown relations between morphologies and stellar populations. We find a strong\ntrend in behaviour of the NIa/NCC ratio depending on host morphology, such that\nearly spirals include more Type Ia SNe. The NIbc/NII ratio is higher in a broad\nbin of early-type hosts. The NIa/NCC ratio is nearly constant when changing\nfrom normal, perturbed to interacting galaxies, then declines in merging\ngalaxies, whereas it jumps to the highest value in post-merging/remnant\ngalaxies. In contrast, the NIbc/NII ratio jumps to the highest value in merging\ngalaxies and slightly declines in post-merging/remnant subsample. The\ninterpretation is that the star formation rates and morphologies of galaxies,\nwhich are strongly affected in the final stages of interaction, have an impact\non the number ratios of SNe types.

Birth kicks from supernova explosions\nmay eject some black holes from their birth clusters, but most should be\nretained. Using a Monte Carlo method we investigate the long-term dynamical\nevolution of globular clusters containing large numbers of stellar black holes.\nWe describe numerical results for 42 models, covering a range of realistic\ninitial conditions, including up to $1.6\\times10^6$ stars. In almost all models\nwe find that significant numbers of black holes (up to $\\sim10^3$) are retained\nall the way to the present. This is in contrast to previous theoretical\nexpectations that most black holes should be ejected dynamically within a few\nGyr. The main reason for this difference is that core collapse driven by black\nholes (through the Spitzer \"mass segregation instability\") is easily reverted\nthrough three-body processes, and involves only a small number of the most\nmassive black holes, while lower-mass black holes remain well-mixed with\nordinary stars far from the central cusp. Thus the rapid segregation of stellar\nblack holes does not lead to a long-term physical separation of most black\nholes into a dynamically decoupled inner core, as often assumed previously.\nCombined with the recent detections of several black hole X-ray binary\ncandidates in Galactic globular clusters, our results suggest that stellar\nblack holes could still be present in large numbers in many globular clusters\ntoday, and that they may play a significant role in shaping the long-term\ndynamical evolution and the present-day dynamical structure of many clusters. \n\n"}

The dividing line between these\ntwo populations in central entropy, and therefore central cooling time, is\namazingly sharp. Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain the dichotomy.\nOne points out that thermal conduction can prevent radiative cooling of cluster\ncores above the dividing line. The other holds that cores below the dividing\nline are subject to thermal instability that fuels the central AGN through a\ncold-feedback mechanism. Here we explore those hypotheses with an analysis of\nthe H-alpha properties of ACCEPT galaxy clusters. We find that the two\nhypotheses are likely to be complementary. Our results support a picture in\nwhich cold clouds inevitably precipitate out of cluster cores in which cooling\noutcompetes thermal conduction and rain down on the central black hole, causing\nAGN feedback that stabilizes the cluster core. In particular, the observed\ndistribution of the cooling-time to freefall-time ratio is nearly identical to\nthat seen in simulations of this cold-feedback process, implying that\ncold-phase accretion, and not Bondi-like accretion of hot-phase gas, is\nresponsible for the AGN feedback that regulates star formation in large\ngalaxies. \n\n"}

A large sample of red giant stars was observed with FORS2@VLT/ESO at\nR ~ 2,000. The method for derivation of stellar parameters is presented with\napplication to six reference clusters. We aim at deriving the stellar\nparameters effective temperature, gravity, metallicity and alpha-element\nenhancement, as well as radial velocity, for membership confirmation of\nindividual stars in each cluster. We analyse the spectra collected for the\nreference globular clusters NGC 6528, NGC 6553, M 71, NGC 6558, NGC 6426 and\nTerzan 8. They cover the full range of globular cluster metallicities, and are\nlocated in the bulge, disc and halo. Full spectrum fitting techniques are\napplied, by comparing each target spectrum with a stellar library in the\noptical region at 4560-5860 A. We employed the library of observed spectra\nMILES, and the synthetic library by Coelho et al. (2005). Validation of the\nmethod is achieved through recovery of the known atmospheric parameters for 49\nwell-studied stars that cover a wide range in the parameter space. We adopted\nas final stellar parameters (effective temperatures, gravities, metallicities)\nthe average of results using MILES and Coelho et al. libraries.

However, galaxy simulations can provide\na means of testing SED modelling techniques.

We use deep optical\nspectra obtained with the IMACS spectrograph at the Magellan telescope to\nmeasure strong oxygen lines. We combine these spectra and metallicities with\n(1) rest-frame UV-to-optical imaging, which allows us to determine stellar\nmasses and dust attenuation corrections, and (2) Ha narrowband imaging, which\nprovides a robust measure of the instantaneous SFR. Our sample spans stellar\nmasses of 10^9 to 6*10^11 solar masses, SFRs of 0.4 to 270 solar masses per\nyear, and metal abundances of 12+log(O/H)~8.3-9.1 (~0.4-2.6 solar metallicity).\nThe correlations that we find between the Ha-based SFR and stellar mass (i.e.,\nthe star-forming \"main sequence\"), and between the stellar mass and\nmetallicity, are both consistent with previous z~1 studies of star-forming\ngalaxies. We then study the relationship between the three properties using\nvarious plane-fitting techniques (Lara-Lopez et al.) and a curve-fitting\nprojection (Mannucci et al.). In all cases, we exclude strong dependence of the\nM-Z relation on SFR, but are unable to distinguish between moderate and no\ndependence. Our results are consistent with previous mass-metallicity-SFR\nstudies. We check whether dataset limitations may obscure a strong dependence\non the SFR by using mock samples drawn from the SDSS.

We\npresent comparisons of shock models with CO, H2, and SiO observations in a\n'pure' shock position in the BHR71 bipolar outflow.

Here\nwe address a significant shortcoming of a Bondi-Hoyle-like prescription\ncommonly invoked to estimate black hole accretion in cosmological hydrodynamic\nsimulations of galaxy formation, namely that the Bondi-Hoyle radius is\nfrequently unresolved. We describe and implement a novel super-Lagrangian\nrefinement scheme to increase, adaptively and 'on the fly', the mass and\nspatial resolution in targeted regions around the accreting black holes at\nlimited computational cost. While our refinement scheme is generically\napplicable and flexible, for the purpose of this paper we select the smallest\nresolvable scales to match black holes' instantaneous Bondi radii, thus\neffectively resolving Bondi-Hoyle-like accretion in full galaxy formation\nsimulations. This permits us to not only estimate gas properties close to the\nBondi radius much more accurately, but also allows us to improve black hole\naccretion and feedback implementations. We thus devise a more generic feedback\nmodel where accretion and feedback depend on the geometry of the local gas\ndistribution and where mass, energy and momentum loading are followed\nsimultaneously. We present a series of tests of our refinement and feedback\nmethods and apply them to models of isolated disc galaxies.

The intergalactic medium prescription of Inoue et\nal.(2014) and galaxy synthesis models of Bruzual&Charlot (2003) have been used\nto properly treat the ultraviolet stellar emission, the stochasticity of the\nintergalactic transmission and mean free path in the ionizing regime. Color\ntracks are computed by turning on/off the escape fraction of ionizing\nradiation. At variance with recent studies, a careful treatment of IGM\ntransmission leads to no significant effects on the high-redshift broad-band\ncolor selection. The decreasing mean free path of ionizing photons with\nincreasing redshift further diminishes the contribution of the LyC to\nbroad-band colors. We also demonstrate that prominent LyC sources can be\nselected under suitable conditions by calculating the probability of a null\nescaping ionizing radiation. The method is applied to a sample of galaxies\nextracted from the GOODS-S field. A known LyC source at z=3.795 is successfully\nrecovered as a LyC emitter candidate and another convincing candidate at\nz=3.212 is reported.

A popular approach known as **differential privacy** offers\nprovable privacy guarantees, but it is often observed in practice that it could\nsubstantially hamper learning accuracy. In this paper we study the learnability\n(whether a problem can be learned by any algorithm) under Vapnik's general\nlearning setting with differential privacy constraint, and reveal some\nintricate relationships between privacy, stability and learnability.\n  In particular, we show that a problem is privately learnable **if an only\nif** there is a private algorithm that asymptotically minimizes the empirical\nrisk (AERM). In contrast, for non-private learning AERM alone is not sufficient\nfor learnability. This result suggests that when searching for private learning\nalgorithms, we can restrict the search to algorithms that are AERM. In light of\nthis, we propose a conceptual procedure that always finds a universally\nconsistent algorithm whenever the problem is learnable under privacy\nconstraint. We also propose a generic and practical algorithm and show that\nunder very general conditions it privately learns a wide class of learning\nproblems.

Abstract: The tidal disruption of the Sagittarius dwarf Spheroidal galaxy (Sgr dSph) is\nproducing the most prominent substructure in the Milky Way (MW) halo, the\nSagittarius Stream. Aside from field stars, the Sgr dSph is suspected to have\nlost a number of globular clusters (GC). Many Galactic GC are suspected to have\noriginated in the Sgr dSph. While for some candidates an origin in the Sgr dSph\nhas been confirmed due to chemical similarities, others exist whose chemical\ncomposition has never been investigated. NGC 5053 and NGC 5634 are two among\nthese scarcely studied Sgr dSph candidate-member clusters. To characterize\ntheir composition we analyzed one giant star in NGC 5053, and two in NGC 5634.\nWe analize high-resolution and signal-to-noise spectra by means of the MyGIsFOS\ncode, determining atmospheric parameters and abundances for up to 21 species\nbetween O and Eu. The abundances are compared with those of MW halo field\nstars, of \"unassociated\" MW halo globulars, and of the metal poor Sgr dSph main\nbody population.\n  We derive a metallicity of [FeII/H]=-2.26+-0.10 for NGC 5053, and of\n[FeI/H]=-1.99+-0.075 and -1.97+-0.076 for the two stars in NGC 5634. This makes\nNGC 5053 one of the most metal poor globular clusters in the MW. Both clusters\ndisplay an alpha enhancement similar to the one of the halo at comparable\nmetallicity. The two stars in NGC 5634 clearly display the Na-O anticorrelation\nwidespread among MW globulars. Most other abundances are in good agreement with\nstandard MW halo trends. The chemistry of the Sgr dSph main body populations is\nsimilar to the one of the halo at low metallicity. It is thus difficult to\ndiscriminate between an origin of NGC 5053 and NGC 5634 in the Sgr dSph, and\none in the MW. However, the abundances of these clusters do appear closer to\nthat of Sgr dSph than of the halo, favoring an origin in the Sgr dSph system. \n\n"}

To distinguish between the pre-heating and assembly bias\nscenarios, we search for relics of energetic feedback events in the\nneighbourhood of central galaxies with different specific star formation rates.\nWe find a significant excess of very high mass ($\\log M_* > 11.3$) galaxies out\nto a distance of 2.5 Mpc around low SFR/$M_*$ central galaxies compared to\ncontrol samples of higher SFR/$M_*$ central galaxies with the same stellar mass\nand redshift. We also find that very massive galaxies in the neighbourhood of\nlow SFR/$M_*$ galaxies have much higher probability of hosting radio loud\nactive galactic nuclei. The radio-loud AGN fraction in neighbours with $\\log\nM_* > 11.3$ is four times higher around passive, non star-forming centrals at\nprojected distances of 1 Mpc and two times higher at projected distances of 4\nMpc.

A\nwell-determined orbit for Pal 5 would enable detailed study of these open\nquestions. We present here the first CCD-based proper motion measurement of Pal\n5 obtained using SDSS as a first epoch and new LBT/LBC images as a second,\ngiving a baseline of 15 years.

In the model, populations of stellar clusters form in the high-pressure\ndiscs of high-redshift ($z>2$) galaxies (a rapid-disruption phase due to tidal\nperturbations from the dense interstellar medium), after which the galaxy\nmergers associated with hierarchical galaxy formation redistribute the\nsurviving, massive clusters into the galaxy haloes, where they remain until the\npresent day (a slow-disruption phase due to tidal evaporation). The high galaxy\nmerger rates of $z>2$ galaxies allow these clusters to be `liberated' into the\ngalaxy haloes before they are disrupted within the high-density discs. This\nphysically-motivated toy model is the first to include the rapid-disruption\nphase, which is shown to be essential for simultaneously reproducing the wide\nvariety of properties of observed GC systems, such as their universal\ncharacteristic mass-scale, the dependence of the specific frequency on\nmetallicity and galaxy mass, the GC system mass-halo mass relation, the\nconstant number of GCs per unit supermassive black hole mass, and the colour\nbimodality of GC systems. The model predicts that most of these observables\nwere already in place at $z=1$-$2$, although under rare circumstances GCs may\nstill form in present-day galaxies. In addition, the model provides important\nconstraints on models for multiple stellar populations in GCs by putting limits\non initial GC masses and the amount of pristine gas accretion.

Whereas for bright sources above the so called critical luminosity\nthese variations are established to be connected with the appearance of the\nhigh accretion column above the neutron star surface, at low, sub-critical\nluminosities the nature of the variations (but with the opposite sign) has not\nbeen discussed widely. We argue here that the cyclotron line is formed when the\nradiation from a hotspot propagates through the plasma falling with a mildly\nrelativistic velocity onto the neutron star surface. The position of the\ncyclotron resonance is determined by the Doppler effect. The change of the\ncyclotron line position in the spectrum with luminosity is caused by variations\nof the velocity profile in the line-forming region affected by the radiation\npressure force.

The extensive radial\ncoverage of the data allows us to measure radial trends in the thickness of\neach MAP. While high-[a/Fe] MAPs have constant scale heights, low-[a/Fe] MAPs\nflare.

Here, we demonstrate that this can be\nachieved by a data-driven approach to spectral modeling. With The Cannon, we\ntransfer information from the APOGEE survey to determine precise Teff, log g,\n[Fe/H], and [$\\alpha$/M] from the spectra of 450,000 LAMOST giants. The Cannon\nfits a predictive model for LAMOST spectra using 9952 stars observed in common\nbetween the two surveys, taking five labels from APOGEE DR12 as ground truth:\nTeff, log g, [Fe/H], [\\alpha/M], and K-band extinction $A_k$. The model is then\nused to infer Teff, log g, [Fe/H], and [$\\alpha$/M] for 454,180 giants, 20% of\nthe LAMOST DR2 stellar sample. These are the first [$\\alpha$/M] values for the\nfull set of LAMOST giants, and the largest catalog of [$\\alpha$/M] for giant\nstars to date. Furthermore, these labels are by construction on the APOGEE\nlabel scale; for spectra with S/N > 50, cross-validation of the model yields\ntypical uncertainties of 70K in Teff, 0.1 in log g, 0.1 in [Fe/H], and 0.04 in\n[$\\alpha$/M], values comparable to the broadly stated, conservative APOGEE DR12\nuncertainties. Thus, by using \"label transfer\" to tie low-resolution (LAMOST R\n$\\sim$ 1800) spectra to the label scale of a much higher-resolution (APOGEE R\n$\\sim$ 22,500) survey, we substantially reduce the inconsistencies between\nlabels measured by the individual survey pipelines.

Here we explore the non-trivial coupling between these two\nprocesses and analyze how the global properties of externally supplied\ncircumbinary disks depend on the binary accretion rate. By formulating our\nresults in terms of the angular momentum flux driven by internal stresses, we\ncome up with a very simple classification of the possible global disk\nstructures, which differ from the standard constant $\\dot M$ accretion disk\nsolution. Suppression of accretion by the binary tides, leading to a\nsignificant mass accumulation in the inner disk, accelerates binary inspiral.\nWe show that once the disk region strongly perturbed by the viscously\ntransmitted tidal torque exceeds the binary semi-major axis, the binary can\nmerge in less than its mass-doubling time due to accretion.

We show that the physical properties obtained\ndirectly from the simulations without post-processing can be very different to\nthose obtained mimicking observational techniques. In order to provide\nsimulators a way to reliably compare their galaxies with SDSS data, for each\nphysical property that we studied - colours, magnitudes, gas and stellar\nmetallicities, mean stellar ages and star formation rates - we give scaling\nrelations that can be easily applied to the values extracted from the\nsimulations. These scalings have in general a high correlation, except for the\ngalaxy mean stellar ages and gas oxygen metallicities. Our simulated galaxies\nare photometrically similar to galaxies in the blue cloud/green valley, but in\ngeneral they appear older, passive and with lower metal content compared to\nmost of the spirals in SDSS. As a careful assessment of the\nagreement/disagreement with observations is the primary test of the baryonic\nphysics implemented in hydrodynamical codes, our study shows that considering\nthe observational biases in the derivation of the galaxies' properties is of\nfundamental importance to decide on the failure/success of a galaxy formation\nmodel. \n\n"}

We study\nthe formation of a gaseous proto-cluster inside a molecular cloud by performing\nhigh resolution MHD simulations and associate its internal properties to those\nof the parent cloud by varying the level of the initial turbulence of the\ncloud, with a view to better characterize the subsequent stellar cluster\nformation.

Both components become too\nfaint to be used as a tracer in observations of high-redshift galaxies. In\nthose cases, the 158 $\\mu$m line of atomic carbon [CII] may be the only way to\nderive M_dyn. As the distribution and kinematics of the ISM tracer affects the\ndetermination of M_dyn, it is important to quantify the relative distributions\nof HI, CO and [CII]. HI and CO are well-characterised observationally, however,\nfor [CII] only very few measurements exist. Here we compare observations of CO,\nHI, and [CII] emission of a sample of nearby galaxies, drawn from the HERACLES,\nTHINGS and KINGFISH surveys. We find that within R_25, the average [CII]\nexponential radial profile is slightly shallower than that of the CO, but much\nsteeper than the HI distribution. This is also reflected in the integrated\nspectrum (\"global profile\"), where the [CII] spectrum looks more like that of\nthe CO than that of the HI. For one galaxy, a spectrally resolved comparison of\nintegrated spectra was possible; other comparisons were limited by the\nintrinsic line-widths of the galaxies and the coarse velocity resolution of the\n[CII] data. Using high-spectral-resolution SOFIA [CII] data of a number of star\nforming regions in two nearby galaxies, we find that their [CII] linewidths\nagree better with those of the CO than the HI. As the radial extent of a given\nISM tracer is a key input in deriving M_dyn from spatially unresolved data, we\nconclude that the relevant length-scale to use in determining M_dyn based on\n[CII] data, is that of the well-characterised CO distribution.

Next, we investigate the angular\nsegregation of satellites with respect to their central galaxy major axis\ndirections, to identify the satellite properties that most strongly predict\ntheir angular segregation.

Quenching at this early epoch destroys the disk and produces\na compact remnant unless the star-forming progenitors at even higher redshifts\nare significantly more dense. At $1<z<2$, the majority of newly quenched\ngalaxies are disks with a significant central bulge. This suggests that\nmass-quenching at this epoch starts from the inner parts and preserves the\ndisk. At $z<1$, the high mass end of the passive SMF is globally in place and\nthe evolution mostly happens at stellar masses below $10^{10}M_\\odot$. \n\n"}

To solve\nthese problems we propose the random parallel stochastic algorithm (RAPSA). We\ncall the algorithm random parallel because it utilizes multiple parallel\nprocessors to operate on a randomly chosen subset of blocks of the feature\nvector. We call the algorithm stochastic because processors choose training\nsubsets uniformly at random. Algorithms that are parallel in either of these\ndimensions exist, but RAPSA is the first attempt at a methodology that is\nparallel in both the selection of blocks and the selection of elements of the\ntraining set. In RAPSA, processors utilize the randomly chosen functions to\ncompute the stochastic gradient component associated with a randomly chosen\nblock. The technical contribution of this paper is to show that this minimally\ncoordinated algorithm converges to the optimal classifier when the training\nobjective is convex. Moreover, we present an accelerated version of RAPSA\n(ARAPSA) that incorporates the objective function curvature information by\npremultiplying the descent direction by a Hessian approximation matrix. We\nfurther extend the results for asynchronous settings and show that if the\nprocessors perform their updates without any coordination the algorithms are\nstill convergent to the optimal argument. RAPSA and its extensions are then\nnumerically evaluated on a linear estimation problem and a binary image\nclassification task using the MNIST handwritten digit dataset. \n\n"}

A global modeling of the broad\n  emission lines in the Optical, UV and X-ray bands Abstract: We model the broad emission lines present in the optical, UV and X-ray\nspectra of Mrk 509, a bright type 1 Seyfert galaxy. The broad lines were\nsimultaneously observed during a large multiwavelength campaign, using the\nXMM-Newton-OM for the optical lines, HST-COS for the UV lines and\nXMM-Newton-RGS and Epic for the X-ray lines respectively.

The goal is\nto find a physical connection among the lines measured at different wavelengths\nand determine the size and the distance from the central source of the emitting\ngas components. We used the \"Locally optimally emission Cloud\" (LOC) model\nwhich interprets the emissivity of the broad line region (BLR) as regulated by\npowerlaw distributions of both gas density and distances from the central\nsource. We find that one LOC component cannot model all the lines\nsimultaneously. In particular, we find that the X-ray and UV lines likely may\noriginate in the more internal part of the AGN, at radii in the range\n~5x10^{14}-3x10^{17} cm, while the optical lines and part of the UV lines may\nlikely be originating further out, at radii ~3x10^{17}-3x^{18} cm.

Choosing an appropriate cut along the filament\nmajor axis, we minimize the impact of the filament emission on the modeling.\nFor the bulk of the core (5000-20000 au) an isothermal sphere model with a\ntemperature of around 10 K provides the best fits. We show that the power law\nindex of the density profile, as well as the constant temperature can be\nderived directly from the radial surface brightness profiles.

To\nexplain these observations Bastian et al. suggested a scenario in which a\nsecond population is formed by the accretion of enriched material onto the\nlow-mass stars in the initial GC population. The idea is that the low-mass,\npre-main sequence stars sweep up gas expelled by the massive stars of the same\ngeneration into their protoplanetary disc as they move through the GC core. We\nperform simulations with 2 different smoothed particle hydrodynamics codes to\ninvestigate if a low-mass star surrounded by a protoplanetary disc can accrete\nthe amount of enriched material required in this scenario. We focus on the gas\nloading rate onto the disc and star as well as on the lifetime of the disc. We\nfind that the gas loading rate is a factor of 2 smaller than the geometric\nrate, because the effective cross section of the disc is smaller than its\nsurface area. The loading rate is consistent for both codes, irrespective of\nresolution. The disc gains mass in the high resolution runs, but loses angular\nmomentum on a time scale of 10^4 yrs. Two effects determine the loss of\n(specific) angular momentum in our simulations: 1) continuous ram pressure\nstripping and 2) accretion of material with no azimuthal angular momentum. Our\nstudy and previous work suggest that the former, dominant process is mainly\ncaused by numerical rather than physical effects, while the latter is not. The\nlatter process causes the disc to become more compact, increasing the surface\ndensity profile at smaller radii. The disc size is determined in the first\nplace by the ram pressure when the flow first hits the disc. Further evolution\nis governed by the decrease in the specific angular momentum of the disc. We\nconclude that the size and lifetime of the disc are probably not sufficient to\naccrete the amount of mass required in Bastian et al.'s scenario. \n\n"}

The simulation includes radiative cooling,\nstar formation, SN feedback and a central massive black hole which is\nundergoing gas accretion and is heating the surroundings via thermal AGN\nfeedback. A large central region in the ErisBH disk becomes bar-unstable after\nz~1.4, but a clear bar-like structure starts to grow significantly only after\nz~0.4, possibly triggered by the interaction with a massive satellite. At z~0.1\nthe bar reaches its maximum radial extent of l~2.2 kpc. As the bar grows, it\nbecomes prone to buckling instability, which we quantify based on the\nanisotropy of the stellar velocity dispersion. The actual buckling event is\nobservable at z~0.1, resulting in the formation of a boxy-peanut bulge clearly\ndiscernible in the edge-on view of the galaxy at z=0. The bar in ErisBH does\nnot dissolve during the formation of the bulge but remains strongly\nnon-axisymmetric down to the resolution limit of ~100 pc at z=0.

These structured representations allow us to\ntease-out and evaluate separately two types of generalization: standard\ngeneralization to new images with similar scenes, and generalization to new\ncombinations of known entities. We compare two learning approaches on the\nMS-COCO dataset: a state-of-the-art recurrent network based on an LSTM (Show,\nAttend and Tell), and a simple structured prediction model on top of a deep\nnetwork. We find that the structured model generalizes to new compositions\nsubstantially better than the LSTM, ~7 times the accuracy of predicting\nstructured representations. By providing a concrete method to quantify\ngeneralization for unseen combinations, we argue that structured\nrepresentations and compositional splits are a useful benchmark for image\ncaptioning, and advocate compositional models that capture linguistic and\nvisual structure. \n\n"}

Here, we launch an investigation\ninto the systematics induced by constraint selection. We model the simulated\ncluster Ares 362 times using random selections of image systems with and\nwithout spectroscopic redshifts and quantify the systematics using several\ndiagnostics: image predictability, accuracy of model-predicted redshifts,\nenclosed mass, and magnification. We find that for models with $>15$ image\nsystems, the image plane rms does not decrease significantly when more systems\nare added; however the rms values quoted in the literature may be misleading as\nto the ability of a model to predict new multiple images. The mass is well\nconstrained near the Einstein radius in all cases, and systematic error drops\nto $<2\\%$ for models using $>10$ image systems. Magnification errors are\nsmallest along the straight portions of the critical curve, and the value of\nthe magnification is systematically lower near curved portions.

We report no trend\nin magnification error with fraction of spectroscopic image systems when\nselecting constraints at random; however, when using the same selection of\nconstraints, increasing this fraction up to $\\sim0.5$ will increase model\naccuracy.

The global\nnature of the collapse implies that the SFR increases over time. The\nhierarchical nature of the collapse consists of small-scale collapses within\nlarger-scale ones. The large-scale collapses culminate a few Myr later than the\nsmall-scale ones and consist of filamentary flows that accrete onto massive\ncentral clumps. The small-scale collapses form clumps that are embedded in the\nfilaments and falling onto the large-scale collapse centers. The stars formed\nin the early, small-scale collapses share the infall motion of their parent\nclumps. Thus, the filaments feed both gaseous and stellar material to the\nmassive central clump. This leads to the presence of a few older stars in a\nregion where new protostars are forming, and also to a self-similar structure,\nin which each unit is composed of smaller-scale sub-units that approach each\nother and may merge. Because the older stars formed in the filaments share the\ninfall motion of the gas onto the central clump, they tend to have larger\nvelocities and to be distributed over larger areas than the younger stars\nformed in the central clump. Finally, interpreting the IMF at face-value as a\nprobability distribution implies that massive stars only form once the {\\it\nlocal} SFR is large enough to sample the IMF up to high masses.

We first show, by\nmeans of pure N-body simulations, that initially co-spatial stellar populations\nwith different in-plane random motions separate when a bar forms. The radially\ncooler populations form a strong bar, and are vertically thin and\npeanut-shaped, while the hotter populations form a weaker bar and become a\nvertically thicker box. We demonstrate that it is the radial, not the vertical,\nvelocity dispersion that dominates this evolution. Assuming that early stellar\ndiscs heat rapidly as they form, then both the in-plane and vertical random\nmotions correlate with stellar age and chemistry, leading to different density\ndistributions for metal-rich and metal-poor stars. We then use a\nhigh-resolution simulation, in which all stars form out of gas, to demonstrate\nthat this is what happens. When we apply these results to the Milky Way we show\nthat a very broad range of observed trends for ages, densities, kinematics and\nchemistries, that have been presented as evidence for contradictory paths to\nthe formation of the bulge, are in fact consistent with a bulge which formed\nfrom a continuum of disc stellar populations which were kinematically separated\nby the bar.

Rather, the externally stored embedding vectors are used at each\ntime-step, but no messages are passed from previous time-steps. This means that\nvanishing gradients aren't a problem, as all of the necessary gradient paths\nare short. However, these paths are extremely numerous (one per embedding\nvector in memory) and reused for a very long time (until it leaves the memory).\nThus, the forward-pass information of each memory must be stored for the entire\nduration of the memory.

Their performance is evaluated by the\nso-called regret that measures the difference of losses between the online\nsolution and the best yet fixed overall solution in hindsight. The present\npaper deals with online convex optimization involving adversarial loss\nfunctions and adversarial constraints, where the constraints are revealed after\nmaking decisions, and can be tolerable to instantaneous violations but must be\nsatisfied in the long term. Performance of an online algorithm in this setting\nis assessed by: i) the difference of its losses relative to the best dynamic\nsolution with one-slot-ahead information of the loss function and the\nconstraint (that is here termed dynamic regret); and, ii) the accumulated\namount of constraint violations (that is here termed dynamic fit). In this\ncontext, a modified online saddle-point (MOSP) scheme is developed, and proved\nto simultaneously yield sub-linear dynamic regret and fit, provided that the\naccumulated variations of per-slot minimizers and constraints are sub-linearly\ngrowing with time. MOSP is also applied to the dynamic network resource\nallocation task, and it is compared with the well-known stochastic dual\ngradient method.

This\npaper aims at quantifying the bias introduced in the estimation of these\nparameters by the distance effect.

In the maps displaced to different distances we extract\ncompact sources, and we derive their physical parameters as if they were\noriginal Hi-GAL maps of the extracted source samples. In this way, we are able\nto discuss how the main physical properties change with distance.

Here we present Chempy, a newly\ndeveloped code for GCE modeling, representing a parametrized open one-zone\nmodel within a Bayesian framework. A Chempy model is specified by a set of 5-10\nparameters that describe the effective galaxy evolution along with the stellar\nand star-formation physics: e.g. the star-formation history, the feedback\nefficiency, the stellar initial mass function (IMF) and the incidence of\nsupernova type Ia (SN Ia). Unlike established approaches, Chempy can sample the\nposterior probability distribution in the full model parameter space and test\ndata-model matches for different nucleosynthetic yield sets. We extend Chempy\nto a multi-zone scheme. As an illustrative application, we show that\ninteresting parameter constraints result from only the ages and elemental\nabundances of Sun, Arcturus and the present-day interstellar medium (ISM). For\nthe first time, we use such information to infer IMF parameter via GCE\nmodeling, where we properly marginalize over nuisance parameters and account\nfor different yield sets. We find that of the IMF $11.6_{-1.6}^{+2.1}$ %\nexplodes as core-collapse SN, compatible with Salpeter 1955. We also constrain\nthe incidence of SN Ia per 10^3 Msun to 0.5-1.4.

Although several parallel training\nalgorithms have been proposed to improve training efficiency, there is no clear\nguidance on which one to choose for the task in hand due to lack of systematic\nand fair comparison among them. In this paper we aim at filling this gap by\ncomparing four popular parallel training algorithms in speech recognition,\nnamely asynchronous stochastic gradient descent (ASGD), blockwise model-update\nfiltering (BMUF), bulk synchronous parallel (BSP) and elastic averaging\nstochastic gradient descent (EASGD), on 1000-hour LibriSpeech corpora using\nfeed-forward deep neural networks (DNNs) and convolutional, long short-term\nmemory, DNNs (CLDNNs).

Previous studies of such stars were either unable to\nresolve hydrodynamical timescales or considered stars in isolation, not in the\nextreme accretion flows in which they actually form. Therefore, they could not\nself-consistently predict their final masses at collapse, or those of the\nresulting supermassive black hole seeds, but rather invoked comparison to\nsimple polytropic models. Here, we systematically examine the birth, evolution\nand collapse of accreting non-rotating supermassive stars under accretion rates\nof 0.01-10 solar masses per year, using the stellar evolution code KEPLER. Our\napproach includes post-Newtonian corrections to the stellar structure and an\nadaptive nuclear network, and can transition to following the hydrodynamic\nevolution of supermassive stars after they encounter the general relativistic\ninstability. We find that this instability triggers the collapse of the star at\nmasses of 150,000-330,000 solar masses for accretion rates of 0.1-10 solar\nmasses per year, and that the final mass of the star scales roughly\nlogarithmically with the rate. The structure of the star, and thus its\nstability against collapse, is sensitive to the treatment of convection, and\nthe heat content of the outer accreted envelope. Comparison with other codes\nsuggests differences here may lead to small deviations in the evolutionary\nstate of the star as a function of time, that worsen with accretion rate. Since\nthe general relativistic instability leads to the immediate death of these\nstars, our models place an upper limit on the masses of the first quasars at\nbirth. \n\n"}

Multi-wavelength studies of such objects up to the highest energies\nprovide new insights into the particle and radiation processes of active\ngalactic nuclei. We report the results from the first multi-wavelength campaign\nobserving the TeV detected nucleus of the active galaxy IC 310, whose jet is\nobserved at a moderate viewing angle of 10 deg - 20 deg. The multi-instrument\ncampaign was conducted between 2012 Nov. and 2013 Jan., and involved\nobservations with MAGIC, Fermi, INTEGRAL, Swift, OVRO, MOJAVE and EVN. These\nobservations were complemented with archival data from the AllWISE and 2MASS\ncatalogs. A one-zone synchrotron self-Compton model was applied to describe the\nbroad-band spectral energy distribution. IC 310 showed an extraordinary TeV\nflare at the beginning of the campaign, followed by a low, but still detectable\nTeV flux. Compared to previous measurements, the spectral shape was found to be\nsteeper during the low emission state. Simultaneous observations in the soft\nX-ray band showed an enhanced energy flux state and a harder-when-brighter\nspectral shape behaviour. No strong correlated flux variability was found in\nother frequency regimes. The broad-band spectral energy distribution obtained\nfrom these observations supports the hypothesis of a double-hump structure. The\nharder-when-brighter trend in the X-ray and VHE emission is consistent with the\nbehaviour expected from a synchrotron self-Compton scenario. The\ncontemporaneous broad-band spectral energy distribution is well described with\na one-zone synchrotron self-Compton model using parameters that are comparable\nto those found for other gamma-ray-emitting misaligned blazars. \n\n"}

However, in models of warm (expanding) star-forming\nregions, whilst the massive stars do come to be in deeper potentials than\naverage stars, they are not mass segregated. In the purely hydrodynamical SPH\nsimulations, the massive stars do come to reside in deeper potentials, which is\ndue to their runaway growth. However, when photoionisation and stellar winds\nare implemented in the simulations, these feedback mechanisms regulate the mass\nof the stars and disrupt the inflow of gas into the clouds' potential wells.\nThis generally makes the potential wells shallower than in the control runs,\nand prevents the massive stars from occupying deeper potentials. This in turn\nresults in the most massive stars having a very similar spatial concentration\nand surface density distribution to lower-mass stars. Whilst massive stars do\nform via competitive accretion in our simulations, this rarely translates to a\ndifferent spatial distribution and so any lack of primordial mass segregation\nin an observed star-forming region does not preclude competitive accretion as a\nviable formation mechanism for massive stars. \n\n"}

As\nfield galaxies have an H I covering fraction of ~100% at similar radii, the\ndearth of CGM H I in our data indicates that the cluster environment has\neffectively stripped or overionized the gaseous halos of these cluster\ngalaxies. Second, we assess the contribution of warm-hot (10^5 - 10^6 K) gas to\nthe ICM as traced by O VI and broad Ly-alpha (BLA) absorption. Despite the high\nsignal-to-noise of our data, we do not detect O VI in any cluster, and we only\ndetect BLA features in the QSO spectrum probing one cluster.

Conversely, it is computationally advantageous to split Bayesian\ninference tasks across subsets of data, but data need not be identically\ndistributed across subsets. One principled way to fuse probability\ndistributions is via the lens of optimal transport: the Wasserstein barycenter\nis a single distribution that summarizes a collection of input measures while\nrespecting their geometry. However, computing the barycenter scales poorly and\nrequires discretization of all input distributions and the barycenter itself.\nImproving on this situation, we present a scalable, communication-efficient,\nparallel algorithm for computing the Wasserstein barycenter of arbitrary\ndistributions. Our algorithm can operate directly on continuous input\ndistributions and is optimized for streaming data. Our method is even robust to\nnonstationary input distributions and produces a barycenter estimate that\ntracks the input measures over time.

For disks with\naspect ratio $H/r$ larger than the viscosity parameter $\\alpha$, bending wave\npropagation effectively makes the disk precess as a quasi-rigid body, while\nviscosity acts on the disk warp and twist to drive secular evolution of the\ndisk-binary inclination. We derive a simple analytic criterion (in terms of the\nbinary eccentricity and initial disk orientation) for the disk to evolve toward\npolar alignment with the eccentric binary. When the disk has a non-negligible\nangular momentum compared to the binary, the final \"polar alignment\"\ninclination angle is reduced from $90^\\circ$. For typical protoplanetary disk\nparameters, the timescale of the inclination evolution is shorter than the disk\nlifetime, suggesting that highly-inclined disks and planets may exist orbiting\neccentric binaries. \n\n"}

When their parameters are properly tuned, AL methods have\nshown fast convergence in CDL.

For general convex objectives, the\nuniformly average iterates generated by \\textsf{SPDPEG} converge in expectation\nwith $O(1/\\sqrt{t})$ rate. While for strongly convex objectives, the uniformly\nand non-uniformly average iterates generated by \\textsf{SPDPEG} converge with\n$O(\\log(t)/t)$ and $O(1/t)$ rates, respectively. The order of the rate of the\nproposed algorithm is known to match the best convergence rate for first-order\nstochastic algorithms.

Some of these gradients resemble those in the\nMilky Way, where they have sometimes been interpreted as due to internal\nevolution, such as scattering off giant molecular clouds, radial migration\ndriven by spiral patterns, or orbital reso- nances with a bar. Secular\nprocesses play a minor role in the simulated galaxy, which lacks strong spiral\nor bar patterns, and where such gradients arise as a result of the gradual\nenrichment of a gaseous disc that is born thick but thins as it turns into\nstars and settles into centrifugal equilibrium. The settling is controlled by\nthe feedback of young stars; which links the star formation, enrichment, and\nequilibration timescales, inducing radial and vertical gradients in the gaseous\ndisc and its descendent stars. The kinematics of coeval stars evolve little\nafter birth and provide a faithful snapshot of the gaseous disc structure at\nthe time of their formation. In this interpretation, the age-velocity\ndispersion relation would reflect the gradual thinning of the disc rather than\nthe importance of secular orbit scattering; the outward flaring of stars would\nresult from the gas disc flare rather than from radial migration; and vertical\ngradients would arise because the gas disc gradually thinned as it enriched.\nSuch radial and vertical trends might just reflect the evolving properties of\nthe parent gaseous disc, and are not necessarily the result of secular\nevolutionary processes. \n\n"}

Motivated by the\ntransition region in the solar atmosphere the temperature and density ratio of\nthe plasmas is chosen as 100 and 0.01, respectively. For better understanding\nof studied processes we make two types of computations: a) without any\ninteractions among plasma particles (free expansion) and b) with the full\nelectromagnetic interactions. In both the cases we found that the flux of cold\nplasma electrons and protons from colder plasma to hotter one dominates over\nthe flux of hot plasma electrons and protons in the opposite direction. Thus,\nthe plasma in the hotter part of the system becomes colder and denser during\ntime evolution. In the case without any interactions among particles the cold\nplasma electrons and protons freely penetrate into the hot plasma. But, the\ncold plasma electrons are faster than cold plasma protons and therefore they\npenetrate deeper into the hotter part of the system than the protons. Thus, the\ncooling of the electron and proton components of the plasma in the hotter part\nof the system is different.

The half-light radii range from 0.01 to 0.2\narcsec (0.05-1 kpc physical) at fixed magnitude. At z>5, the size of galaxies\nat fixed stellar mass/luminosity evolves as (1+z)^{-m}, with m~1-2.

A popular workaround to this has been to relax\nnon-convex problems to convex ones and use traditional methods to solve the\n(convex) relaxed optimization problems. However this approach may be lossy and\nnevertheless presents significant challenges for large scale optimization.\n  On the other hand, direct approaches to non-convex optimization have met with\nresounding success in several domains and remain the methods of choice for the\npractitioner, as they frequently outperform relaxation-based techniques -\npopular heuristics include projected gradient descent and alternating\nminimization.

Here we investigate the physical processes that enable such a\nmeasurement for cool stars, such as K-giants. We show that the strongest\nspectral diagnostics of oxygen come from the CNO atomic-molecular network, but\nare manifested in spectral features that do not involve oxygen.

The\nso-called convolution approach does not store many overlapping patches, and\nthus overcomes the memory problems particularly with careful algorithmic\ndesigns; it has been studied within the \"synthesis\" signal model, e.g.,\nconvolutional dictionary learning. This paper proposes a new convolutional\nanalysis operator learning (CAOL) framework that learns an analysis sparsifying\nregularizer with the convolution perspective, and develops a new convergent\nBlock Proximal Extrapolated Gradient method using a Majorizer (BPEG-M) to solve\nthe corresponding block multi-nonconvex problems.

Long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit\n(GRU) were developed to address these problems, but the use of hyperbolic\ntangent and the sigmoid action functions results in gradient decay over layers.\nConsequently, construction of an efficiently trainable deep network is\nchallenging.

The dynamical and\ndust emission properties of CRLE suggest an ongoing merger driving the\nstarburst, in a potentially intermediate stage relative to other known dusty\ngalaxies at the same epoch. The ratio of [CII] to [NII] may suggest that an\nimportant ($\\sim15\\%$) contribution to the [CII] emission comes from a diffuse\nionized gas component, which could be more extended than the dense,\nstarbursting gas. CRLE appears to be located in a significant galaxy\noverdensity at the same redshift, potentially associated with a large-scale\ncosmic structure recently identified in a Lyman Alpha Emitter survey. This\noverdensity suggests that CRLE and HZ10 reside in a protocluster environment,\noffering the tantalizing opportunity to study the effect of a massive starburst\non protocluster star formation.

Even for\napplications with nonconvex nonsmooth losses (such as modern deep networks),\nthe population risk is generally significantly more well-behaved from an\noptimization point of view than the empirical risk. In particular, sampling can\ncreate many spurious local minima.

The radial velocity of a star is\nobtained through a fit of the RVS spectrum relative to an appropriate synthetic\ntemplate spectrum. An additional task of the spectroscopic pipeline was to\nprovide 1st-order estimates of the stellar atmospheric parameters required to\nselect such template spectra.

We find that the\nradial profile of 21-cm differential brightness temperature is quite sensitive\nto the stellar and halo masses, which reflects the time evolution of the escape\nfraction. In the case of a less massive star, ionizing photons hardly escape\nfrom its host halo due to the absorption by dense halo gas, thus an deep 21-cm\nabsorption feature at just outside the halo lasts a long time. Whereas photons\nfrom a massive star well working to heat the ambient intergalactic medium turn\nout to cause a spatially extended 21-cm emission signature.

Estimating power spectrum from observations can be done either by\nusing the directly measured quantity visibility or by reconstructing the sky\nbrightness distribution (or image) from the visibilities. By using simulated\nobservations of a model galaxy with known power spectrum we find that the\nvisibility based estimator reproduce the true power spectrum. The image based\nestimator has a scale dependent bias that is highly correlated to the\nincompleteness in the baseline coverage of the interferometer. Interestingly,\nwe found that the noise in the reconstructed image has zero mean and hence the\nlocally averaged quantities estimated from the reconstructed image are\nunbiased. We implement the visibility moment estimator as discussed in Dutta et\nal. (2015) and estimate the line of sight velocity fluctuation of the spiral\ngalaxy NGC6946. Our result strongly indicate presence of large scale turbulence\nin the spiral galaxies. We conclude that we would need to have higher signal to\nnoise H~{\\sc i}observations to definitively comment on the generating\nmechanisms of the large scale turbulence. \n\n"}

It is best-suited for\noptimization over continuous domains of less than 20 dimensions, and tolerates\nstochastic noise in function evaluations. It builds a surrogate for the\nobjective and quantifies the uncertainty in that surrogate using a Bayesian\nmachine learning technique, Gaussian process regression, and then uses an\nacquisition function defined from this surrogate to decide where to sample. In\nthis tutorial, we describe how Bayesian optimization works, including Gaussian\nprocess regression and three common acquisition functions: expected\nimprovement, entropy search, and knowledge gradient. We then discuss more\nadvanced techniques, including running multiple function evaluations in\nparallel, multi-fidelity and multi-information source optimization,\nexpensive-to-evaluate constraints, random environmental conditions, multi-task\nBayesian optimization, and the inclusion of derivative information.

For example,\nthe Apollo lunar module implemented a Kalman filter to infer its location from\na sequence of earth-based radar measurements and land safely on the moon.\n  To perform Bayesian filtering, we require a measurement model that describes\nthe conditional distribution of each observation given state. The Kalman filter\ntakes this measurement model to be linear, Gaussian.

Such a batch learning setting is ubiquitous in online and interactive\nsystems, such as ad platforms and recommendation systems. Existing approaches\nbased on inverse propensity weights, such as Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS)\nand Policy Optimizer for Exponential Models (POEM), enjoy unbiasedness but\noften suffer from large mean squared error.

Low\n$e$ stars exhibit no such change of slope within the observed [Fe/H] range and\nshow slightly higher abundances of Mg, Al and Ni. Unlike their low $e$\ncounterparts, high $e$ stars show slightly retrograde motion, make higher\nvertical excursions and reach larger apocentre radii.

We want\nto assess the role of Galactic cosmic rays in the formation of atomic hydrogen,\nby using recent developments in the characterisation of the low-energy spectra\nof cosmic rays and advances in the modelling of their propagation in molecular\nclouds. We model the attenuation of the interstellar cosmic rays entering a\ncloud and compute the dissociation rate of molecular hydrogen due to collisions\nwith cosmic-ray protons and electrons as well as fast hydrogen atoms. We\ncompare our results with the available observations. The cosmic-ray\ndissociation rate is entirely determined by secondary electrons produced in\nprimary ionisation collisions. These secondary particles constitute the only\nsource of atomic hydrogen at column densities above $\\sim10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$.

By comparing the relative abundances of\ndifferent ions in individually-matched components, we show that cool gas (T~1e4\nK) density and metallicity can vary by more than a factor of ten in in an LRG\nhalo. Specifically, metal-poor absorbing components with <1/10 solar\nmetallicity are seen in 50% of the LRG halos, while gas with solar and\nsuper-solar metallicity is also common. These results indicate a complex\nmultiphase structure and poor chemical mixing in these quiescent halos.

Unfortunately, such topology knowledge is\noften unavailable due to limited investment, especially for \\revv{low-voltage}\ndistribution grids. Also, the bus phase labeling information is inaccurate due\nto human errors or outdated records.

The proposed model can effectively make use of\nauxiliary data sets with various granularities by hierarchically incorporating\nGaussian processes.

In this paper we study the star-forming\ngas properties of a large sample of post-starburst galaxies selected from the\ncosmological, hydrodynamical EAGLE simulations. These objects resemble observed\nhigh-mass post-starburst galaxies both spectroscopically and in terms of their\nspace density, stellar mass distribution and sizes. We find that the vast\nmajority of simulated post-starburst galaxies have significant gas reservoirs,\nwith star-forming gas masses of ~10$^9$ M$_{\\odot}$, in good agreement with\nthose seen in observational samples. The simulation reproduces the observed\ntime evolution of the gas fraction of the post-starburst galaxy population,\nwith the average galaxy losing ~90 per cent of its star-forming interstellar\nmedium in only ~600 Myr.

Observations of CO(3-2) in hyper-luminous QSO\n  fields Abstract: A primary goal of the SCUBA-2 Web survey is to perform tomography of the\nearly inter-galactic medium by studying systems containing some of the\nbrightest quasi-stellar objects (QSOs; 2.5<z<3.0) and nearby submillimetre\ngalaxies. As a first step, this paper aims to characterize the galaxies that\nhost the QSOs. To achieve this, a sample of 13 hyper-luminous (L_AGN>10^14\nL_odot) QSOs with previous submillimetre continuum detections were followed up\nwith CO(3-2) observations using the NOEMA interferometer. All but two of the\nQSOs are detected in CO(3-2); for one non-detection, our observations show a\ntentative 2sigma line at the expected position and redshift, and for the other\nnon-detection we find only continuum flux density an order of magnitude\nbrighter than the other sources. In three of the fields, a companion\npotentially suitable for tomography is detected in CO line emission within 25\narcsec of the QSO. We derive gas masses, dynamical masses and far-infrared\nluminosities, and show that the QSOs in our sample have similar properties as\ncompared to less luminous QSOs and SMGs in the literature, despite the fact\nthat their black-hole masses (which are proportional to L_AGN) are 1-2 orders\nof magnitude larger. We discuss two interpretations of these observations: this\nis due to selection effects, such as preferential face-on viewing angles and\npicking out objects in the tail ends of the scatter in host-galaxy mass and\nblack-hole mass relationships; or the black hole masses have been overestimated\nbecause the accretion rates are super-Eddington. \n\n"}

Partially motivated by a\nrecent suggestion that large non-isobaric clouds can `shatter' into tiny\ncloudlets, we revisit the linear theory to survey all possible regimes of\nthermal instability. We uncover seven regimes in total, one of which allows\nthree unstable condensation modes. Using the code Athena++, we determine the\nnumerical requirements to properly evolve small amplitude perturbations of the\nentropy mode into the nonlinear regime. Our 1D numerical simulations\ndemonstrate that for a typical AGN cooling function, the nonlinear evolution of\na single eigenmode in an isobarically unstable plasma involves increasingly\nlarger amplitude oscillations in cloud size, temperature and density as the\nwavelength increases.

Significant differences are found\nwith single star evolution, chiefly because the helium core loses mass during\nhelium burning rather than gaining it from hydrogen shell burning. Consequently\npresupernova stars for a given initial mass function have considerably smaller\nmass when they die and will be easier to explode.

For clusters, up to 90 per cent of galaxy disruption\noccurs in lower-mass sub-groups (i.e., during pre-processing); 96 per cent of\nsatellites in massive clusters that were accreted at z < 2 and have not been\npre-processed survive. Of those satellites that are disrupted, only a few per\ncent merge with other satellites, even in low-mass groups. The survival\nfraction changes rapidly from less than 10 per cent of those accreted at high z\nto more than 90 per cent at low z. This shift, which reflects faster disruption\nof satellites accreted at higher z, happens at lower z for more massive\ngalaxies and those accreted onto less massive haloes. The disruption of\nsatellite galaxies is found to correlate only weakly with their pre-accretion\nbaryon content, star formation rate, and size, so that surviving galaxies are\nnearly unbiased in these properties. These results suggest that satellite\ndisruption in massive haloes is uncommon, and that it is predominantly the\nresult of gravitational rather than baryonic processes. \n\n"}

The Large-Scale Structure\n  and Dynamics of Filamentary Molecular Clouds Abstract: We perform ideal MHD high resolution AMR simulations with driven turbulence\nand self-gravity and find that long filamentary molecular clouds are formed at\nthe converging locations of large-scale turbulence flows and the filaments are\nbounded by gravity. The magnetic field helps shape and reinforce the long\nfilamentary structures. The main filamentary cloud has a length of ~4.4 pc.\nInstead of a monolithic cylindrical structure, the main cloud is shown to be a\ncollection of fiber/web-like sub-structures similar to filamentary clouds such\nas L1495. Unless the line-of-sight is close to the mean field direction, the\nlarge-scale magnetic field and striations in the simulation are found roughly\nperpendicular to the long axis of the main cloud, similar to 1495. This\nprovides strong support for a large-scale moderately strong magnetic field\nsurrounding L1495. We find that the projection effect from observations can\nlead to incorrect interpretations of the true three-dimensional physical shape,\nsize, and velocity structure of the clouds. Helical magnetic field structures\nfound around filamentary clouds that are interpreted from Zeeman observations\ncan be explained by a simple bending of the magnetic field that pierces through\nthe cloud. We demonstrate that two dark clouds form a T-shape configuration\nwhich are strikingly similar to the Infrared dark cloud SDC13 leading to the\ninterpretation that SDC13 results from a collision of two long filamentary\nclouds.

We derived accurate stellar ages for the cluster NGC6530,\nassociated with the Lagoon Nebula to infer its SF history. We use the Gaia-ESO\nsurvey observations and Gaia DR2 data, to derive cluster membership and\nfundamental stellar parameters. We identified 652 confirmed and 9 probable\nmembers. The reddening inferred for members and non-members allows us to\ndistinguish MS stars and giants, in agreement with the distances inferred from\nGaia DR2 data. The foreground and background stars show a spatial pattern that\ntraces the 3D structure of the nebular dust component. We derive stellar ages\nfor 382 confirmed cluster members and we find that the gravity-sensitive gamma\nindex distribution for M stars is correlated with stellar age. For all members\nwith Teff<5500 K, the mean logarithmic age is 5.84 (units of years) with a\ndispersion of 0.36 dex. The age distribution of stars with accretion and/or\ndisk (CTTSe) is similar to that of stars without accretion and without disk\n(WTTSp). We interpret this dispersion as evidence of a real age spread since\nthe total uncertainties on age determinations, derived from Monte Carlo\nsimulations, are significantly smaller than the observed spread. This\nconclusion is supported by the evidence of a decreasing of the\ngravity-sensitive gamma index as a function of stellar ages. The presence of\nthe age spread is also supported by the spatial distribution and the kinematics\nof old and young members. In particular, members with accretion and/or disk,\nformed in the last 1 Myr, show evidence of subclustering around the cluster\ncenter, in the Hourglass Nebula and in the M8-E region, suggesting a possible\ntriggering of star formation events by the O-type star ionization fronts. \n\n"}

In particular, the radio surface brightness ($\\Sigma$) evolves\nwith diameter as $\\sim D^{-(0.3 \\div 0.5)}$, while the bounding shock is strong\n(Mach number is ${\\mathcal M} \\geq10$), followed by steep decrease (steeper\nthan $\\sim D^{-4.5}$) for ${\\cal M} <10$. Such evolution of the surface\nbrightness with diameter and its strong dependence on the environmental\nparameters strongly reduce the usefulness of $\\Sigma - D$ relations as a tool\nfor determining the distances to SNRs. The model predicts no radio emission\nfrom SNRs in the late radiative stage of evolution and the existence of\nradio-quiet but relatively active SNRs is possible. Our model easily explains\nvery large-diameter radio sources such as the Galactic Loops and the candidates\nfor Hypernova radio remnants. The model predicts that most of the observed SNRs\nare located in a tenuous phase of the ISM. From the comparison of the model\nresults with the statistics of evolved shell-type SNRs, we were able to\nestimate the fraction of electrons accelerated from the thermal pool in the\nrange $(3\\div 11) \\times 10^{- 4}$. \n\n"}

It is decelerated and shock-heated abruptly by a termination\nshock that forms when the supersonic outflow collides with the slower preceding\nsupernova ejecta. The radial position of this reverse shock varies with time\nand depends on the strength of the neutrino wind and the different conditions\nin progenitor stars with different masses and structure. Its basic properties\nand behavior can be understood by simple analytic considerations. We\ndemonstrate that the entropy of matter going through the reverse shock can\nincrease to a multiple of the asymptotic wind value.

Since\nthe tracks published by different groups differ, it is often only possible to\ngive a rough estimate of the masses of young stars. It is thus crucial to test\nand calibrate the tracks. Up to now, only a few tests of the tracks could be\ncarried out. However, with the VLTI it is now possible to set constrains on the\ntracks by determining the masses of many young binary stars precisely. In order\nto use the VLTI efficiently, a first step is to find suitable targets, which is\nthe purpose of this work. Given the distance of nearby star-forming regions,\nsuitable VLTI targets are binaries with orbital periods between at least 50\ndays, and few years. Although a number of surveys for detecting spectroscopic\nbinaries have been carried out, most of the binaries found so far have periods\nwhich are too short. We thus surveyed the Chamaeleon, Corona Australis, Lupus,\nSco-Cen, rho Ophiuci star-forming regions in order to search for spectroscopic\nbinaries with periods longer than 50 days, which are suitable for the VLTI\nobservations. As a result of the 8 years campaign we discovered 8 binaries with\norbital periods longer than 50 days. Amongst the newly discovered long period\nbinaries is CS Cha, which is one of the few classical T Tauri stars with a\ncircumbinary disk. The survey is limited to objects with masses higher than 0.1\nto 0.2 Modot for periods between 1 and 8 years.

The degree of color\nevolution is similar for clusters at similar redshift, and does not depend\nstrongly on the optical richness or X-ray luminosity of the cluster, suggesting\nthat the history of early-type galaxies is relatively insensitive to\nenvironment.

Abstract: Aperiodic optical variability is a common property of Active Galactic Nuclei\n(AGNs), though its physical origin is still open to question. To study the\norigin of the optical -- ultraviolet variability in AGN, we compare light\ncurves of two models to observations of quasar 0957+561 in terms of a structure\nfunction analysis. In the starburst (SB) model, random superposition of\nsupernovae in the nuclear starburst region produce aperiodic luminosity\nvariations, while in the disk-instability (DI) model, variability is caused by\ninstabilities in the accretion disk around a supermassive black hole. We\ncalculate fluctuating light curves and structure functions, $V(\\tau)$, by\nsimple Monte-Carlo simulations on the basis of the two models. Each resultant\n$V(\\tau)$ possesses a power-law portion, $[V(\\tau)]^{1/2} \\propto\n\\tau^{\\beta}$, at short time lags ($\\tau$).

In addition, we examine the\ntime-asymmetry of the light curves by calculating $V(\\tau)$ separately for\nbrightening and decaying phases. The two models exhibit opposite trends of\ntime-asymmetry to some extent, although the present observation is not long\nenough to test this prediction. \n\n"}

{"id": "hep-th/0501096", "contents": "Title: One-loop f(R) gravity in de Sitter universe Abstract: Motivated by the dark energy issue, the one-loop quantization approach for a\nfamily of relativistic cosmological theories is discussed in some detail.\nSpecifically, general $f(R)$ gravity at the one-loop level in a de Sitter\nuniverse is investigated, extending a similar program developed for the case of\npure Einstein gravity. Using generalized zeta regularization, the one-loop\neffective action is explicitly obtained off-shell, what allows to study in\ndetail the possibility of (de)stabilization of the de Sitter background by\nquantum effects. The one-loop effective action maybe useful also for the study\nof constant curvature black hole nucleation rate and it provides the plausible\nway of resolving the cosmological constant problem. \n\n"}
