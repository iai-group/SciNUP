The\nfield induced magnetic state in the superconducting state is stable up to the\nhighest field. At p_c the antiferromagnetic ground-state under high magnetic\nfield collapses very rapidly.

While no\nFaraday effect was found in this frequency range to the limits of our\nexperimental uncertainty (1.3 milli-radian or 0.07$^\\circ$), a small but\nsignificant polarization rotation was detected that derives from an anomalous\nlinear dichroism. In YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ the effect has a temperature onset that\nmirrors the pseudogap temperature T$^*$ and is enhanced in magnitude in\nunderdoped samples. In $x=1/8$ La$_{2-x}$Ba$_{x}$CuO$_4$, the effect onsets\nabove room temperature, but shows a dramatic enhancement near a temperature\nscale known to be associated with spin and charge ordered states. These\nfeatures are consistent with a loss of both C$_4$ rotation and mirror symmetry\nin the electronic structure of the CuO$_2$ planes in the pseudogap state. \n\n"}

Our\nhigh-resolution neutron scattering measurements show that the elastic (-0.02\nmeV < E < 0.02 meV) (1/2,1/2,1/2) scattering develops strongly below ~275 mK,\nand correlates with the opening of a spin gap of ~0.06-0.08 meV over most of\nthe Brillouin zone.

In agreement with some previous claims in the literature, we find\nthat in a lattice regularization which respects gauge invariance, the chiral\nmagnetic conductivity vanishes.

Abstract: Although the existence of nematic order in iron-based superconductors is now\na well-established experimental fact, its origin remains controversial. Nematic\norder breaks the discrete lattice rotational symmetry by making the $x$ and $y$\ndirections in the Fe plane non-equivalent. This can happen because of (i) a\ntetragonal to orthorhombic structural transition, (ii) a spontaneous breaking\nof an orbital symmetry, or (iii) a spontaneous development of an Ising-type\nspin-nematic order - a magnetic state that breaks rotational symmetry but\npreserves time-reversal symmetry. The Landau theory of phase transitions\ndictates that the development of one of these orders should immediately induce\nthe other two, making the origin of nematicity a physics realization of a\n\"chicken and egg problem\". The three scenarios are, however, quite different\nfrom a microscopic perspective. While in the structural scenario lattice\nvibrations (phonons) play the dominant role, in the other two scenarios\nelectronic correlations are responsible for the nematic order. In this review,\nwe argue that experimental and theoretical evidence strongly points to the\nelectronic rather than phononic mechanism, placing the nematic order in the\nclass of correlation-driven electronic instabilities, like superconductivity\nand density-wave transitions. We discuss different microscopic models for\nnematicity in the iron pnictides, and link nematicity to other ordered states\nof the global phase diagram of these materials -- magnetism and\nsuperconductivity. In the magnetic model nematic order pre-empts stripe-type\nmagnetic order, and the same interaction which favors nematicity also gives\nrise to an unconventional $s^{+-}$ superconductivity. In the charge/orbital\nmodel magnetism appears as a secondary effect of ferro-orbital order, and the\ninteraction which favors nematicity gives rise to a conventional $s^{++}$\nsuperconductivity. \n\n"}

In this case, there\ncan be multiple distinct quantum phases with the same anyons and statistics,\nbut with different patterns of symmetry fractionalization - termed symmetry\nenriched topological (SET) order. When the global symmetry group $G$, which we\ntake to be discrete, does not change topological superselection sectors - i.e.\ndoes not change one type of anyon into a different type of anyon - one can\nimagine a local version of the action of $G$ around each anyon.

This is because\ntransport, entanglement, and operator spreading can be hindered by `Griffiths'\nrare regions which locally resemble the many-body-localized phase and thus act\nas weak links. We propose coarse-grained models for entanglement growth and for\nthe spreading of quantum operators in the presence of such weak links. We also\nexamine entanglement growth across a single weak link numerically. We show that\nthese weak links have a stronger effect on entanglement growth than previously\nassumed: entanglement growth is sub-ballistic whenever such weak links have a\npower-law probability distribution at low couplings, i.e. throughout the entire\nthermal Griffiths phase. We argue that the probability distribution of the\nentanglement entropy across a cut can be understood from a simple picture in\nterms of a classical surface growth model. Surprisingly, the four length scales\nassociated with (i) production of entanglement, (ii) spreading of conserved\nquantities, (iii) spreading of operators, and (iv) the width of the `front' of\na spreading operator, are characterized by dynamical exponents that in general\nare all distinct.

In Fermi liquids with a large Fermi surface and\nweak electron-impurity scattering, we provide universal and simple formulas for\nthe behavior of the thermoelectric conductivities across the\nballistic-to-hydrodynamic crossover. In this regime, the electrical\nconductivity is relatively unchanged by hydrodynamic effects. In contrast, the\nthermal conductivity can be parametrically smaller than predicted by the\nWiedemann-Franz law. A less severe violation of the Mott law arises. We\nquantitatively compare the violations of the Wiedemann-Franz law arising from\n(i) momentum-conserving electron-electron scattering in the collision integral,\n(ii) hydrodynamic modifications of the electron-impurity scattering rate, and\n(iii) thermal broadening of the Fermi surface, and show that (i) is the\nlargest.

For\ninstance, the two-dimensional Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice is central\nto the ab initio description of the electronic structure of carbon\nnanomaterials, such as graphene. Such low-dimensional Hubbard models are\nadvantageously studied with Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, such as Hybrid\nMonte Carlo (HMC). HMC is the standard algorithm of the lattice gauge theory\ncommunity, as it is well suited to theories of dynamical fermions. As HMC\nperforms continuous, global updates of the lattice degrees of freedom, it\nprovides superior scaling with system size relative to local updating methods.\nA potential drawback of HMC is its susceptibility to ergodicity problems due to\nso-called exceptional configurations, for which the fermion operator cannot be\ninverted. Recently, ergodicity problems were found in some formulations of HMC\nsimulations of the Hubbard model. Here, we address this issue directly and\nclarify under what conditions ergodicity is maintained or violated in HMC\nsimulations of the Hubbard model. We study different lattice formulations of\nthe fermion operator and provide explicit, representative calculations for\nsmall systems, often comparing to exact results.

Whenever a new class of high-Tc\nsuperconducting materials is discovered, a lot of effort is devoted to growing\nsingle crystals and epitaxial thin films for exploring basic physical\nquantities. Although several properties of FBS are similar to the cuprates\n(large upper critical fields, resulting from a short coherence lengths, and\nsmall carrier density), others are distinctly different. For instance, in FBS\nthe symmetry of the superconducting order parameter is most likely not a d-wave\nbut an s+-wave, depending on the stoichiometry, crystallographic system, and\ndoping level. Additionally, the critical current densities of FBS are less\nsensitive to the presence of grain boundaries (GBs) than those of the high-Tc\ncuprates. These features are highly beneficial for the realization of cheaper\nconductors for high-field magnets at low temperatures. Indeed, several groups\nhave demonstrated FBS thin films on technical metallic substrates and\npowder-in-tube processed FBS wires as proof-of-principle studies for conductor\napplications.

We start by recalling why the extended symmetry notion\nof quantum double algebras is an optimal tool when analyzing a wide variety of\ntwo dimensional physical systems including quantum fluids, crystals and liquid\ncrystals. The power of this approach stems from the fact that one may\ncharacterize both ordinary and topological modes as representations of a single\n(generally non-Abelian) Hopf symmetry. In principle a full classification of\ndefect mediated as well as ordinary symmetry breaking patterns and subsequent\nconfinement phenomena can be given.

To elucidate this long-standing issue, we\nstudy a Hubbard model with a strong onsite impurity potential based on an\nimproved fluctuation-exchange (FLEX) approximation, which we call the GV^I-FLEX\nmethod. This model corresponds to the HTSC with dilute nonmagnetic impurity\nconcentration. We find that (i) both local and staggered susceptibilities are\nstrongly enhanced around the impurity. By this reason, (ii) the quasiparticle\nlifetime as well as the local density of states (DOS) are strongly suppressed\nin a wide area around the impurity (like a Swiss cheese hole), which causes the\n``huge residual resistivity'' beyond the s-wave unitary scattering limit. We\nstress that the excess quasiparticle damping rate caused by impurities has\nstrong momentum-dependence due to non-s-wave scatterings induced by many-body\neffects, so the structure of the ``hot spot/cold spot'' in the host system\npersists against impurity doping.

We introduce an effective two-level\nmodel with dissipation and randomness (imperfections), which is based upon the\nidea that ideal Grover's algorithm operates in a 2-dimensional Hilbert space.\nThe simulation results of this model and Grover's algorithm with imperfections\nare compared, and it is found that they are in good agreement for appropriately\ntuned parameters. It turns out that the main features of Grover's algorithm\nwith imperfections can be understood in terms of two basic mechanisms, namely,\na diffusion of probability density into the full Hilbert space and a stochastic\nrotation within the original 2-dimensional Hilbert space. \n\n"}

We show for a\nlarge class of models that already on the level of single specimens of spin\nchains, criticality is accompanied with the possibility of distilling a\nmaximally entangled state of arbitrary dimension from a sufficiently large\nblock deterministically, with local operations and classical communication.\nThese analytical results -- which refine previous results on the divergence of\nblock entropy as the rate at which EPR pairs can be distilled from many\nidentically prepared chains, and which apply to single systems as encountered\nin actual experimental situations -- are made quantitative for general\nisotropic translationally invariant spin chains that can be mapped onto a\nquasi-free fermionic system, and for the anisotropic XY model. For the XX\nmodel, we provide the asymptotic scaling of ~(1/6) log_2(L), and contrast it\nwith the block entropy. The role of superselection rules on single-copy\nentanglement in systems consisting of indistinguishable particles is\nemphasized. \n\n"}

In our setup two ancillas are weakly\ncoupled to the quantum many body system at different sites, and we study the\npropagation of an excitation and quantum information from one ancilla to the\nother. We observe two different scenarios: a slow, but perfect transfer if the\ngap large and a fast, but un-complete transfer otherwise. We provide a\nnumerical and analytical approach as well as a simplified physical model\nexplaining our findings. Our results relate the potential of spin chains acting\nas quantum channels to the concept of quantum phase transitions and offer a\ndifferent approach to the characterisation of these. \n\n"}

The mathematical treatment utilises well\nknown results [Gib02, Tol38, Weh78, Par89], but most importantly, incorporates\na variety of arguments on the phenomenological properties of thermal states\n[Szi25, TQ63, HK65, GB91] and of statistical distributions[HG76, PW78, Len78].\nThis enables the identification of the canonical distribution as the unique\nrepresentation of thermal states without approximation or presupposing the\nexistence of an entropy function.
