Pauksztello has independently introduced them as\nco-t-structures). This axiomatizes the properties of stupid truncations of\ncomplexes in $K(B)$. We also construct weight structures for Voevodsky's\ncategories of motives and for various categories of spectra. A weight structure\n$w$ defines Postnikov towers of objects; these towers are canonical and\nfunctorial 'up to morphisms that are zero on cohomology'. For $Hw$ being the\nheart of $w$ (in $DM_{gm}$ we have $Hw=Chow$) we define a canonical\nconservative 'weakly exact' functor $t$ from our $C$ to a certain weak category\nof complexes $K_w(Hw)$. For any (co)homological functor $H:C\\to A$ for an\nabelian $A$ we construct a weight spectral sequence $T:H(X^i[j])\\implies\nH(X[i+j])$ where $(X^i)=t(X)$; it is canonical and functorial starting from\n$E_2$.

This topological Chern map provides a natural candidate for the\nexistence of a rational structure on the periodic cylic homology of a smooth\nproper dg-algebra, within the theory of noncommutative Hodge structures. The\ndefinition of topological K-theory consists in two steps : taking the\ntopological realization of algebraic K-theory, and inverting the Bott element.\nThe topological realization is the left Kan extension of the functor \"space of\ncomplex points\" to all simplicial presheaves over complex algebraic varieties.\nOur first main result states that the topological K-theory of the unit\ndg-category is the spectrum BU. For this we are led to prove a homotopical\ngeneralization of Deligne's cohomological proper descent, using Lurie's proper\ndescent. The fact that the Chern character descends to topological K-theory is\nestablished by using Kassel's K\\\"unneth formula for periodic cyclic homology\nand once again the proper descent result. In the case of a dg-category of\nperfect complexes on a smooth scheme, we show that we recover the usual\ntopological K-theory. Finally in the case of a finite dimensional associative\nalgebra, we show that the lattice conjecture holds. This gives a formula for\nthe periodic homology groups of a finite dimensional algebra in terms of the\nstack of projective modules of finite type. \n\n"}

Therefore this paper is mostly a survey paper, but the\npresentation is new, and there are included some new results as well. In\nparticular, Sections 3 and 4 provide a complete short introduction to analysis\non noncompact manifolds that is geared towards a class of manifolds--called\n\"Lie manifolds\"--that often appears in practice. Our interest in Lie manifolds\nis due to the fact that they provide the link between analysis on singular\nspaces and operator algebras. The groupoids integrating Lie manifolds play an\nimportant background role in establishing this link because they provide\noperator algebras whose structure is often well understood. The initial\nmotivation for the work surveyed here--work that spans over close to two\ndecades--was to develop the index theory of stratified singular spaces.\nMeanwhile, several other applications have emerged as well, including\napplications to Partial Differential Equations and Numerical Methods. These\nwill be mentioned only briefly, however, due to the lack of space. Instead, we\nshall concentrate on the applications to Index theory. \n\n"}

The paper deals with the\ncalculation of the fractional part of the eta-invariant in this case. The\nmethod used to obtain the corresponding formula is based on the index theorem\nfor elliptic operators in subspaces. It also utilizes K-theory with\ncoefficients Z_n. In particular, it is shown that the group K(T^*M,Z_n) is\nrealized by elliptic operators (symbols) acting in appropriate subspaces. \n\n"}
