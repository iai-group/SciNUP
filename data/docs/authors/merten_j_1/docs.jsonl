This agreement requires that the\ngalactic halo be of sufficient extent to maintain the galaxy at high curvature\nin the presence of the low-curvature cosmological background. If the galactic\nhalo and local environment in f(R) models do not have substantially deeper\npotentials than expected in LCDM, then cosmological field amplitudes |f_R| >\n10^{-6} will cause the galactic interior to evolve to low curvature during the\nacceleration epoch.

Weak lensing is\nsensitive to the growth of structure and the relation between matter and\ngravitational potentials, both of which will in general be affected by modified\ngravity. Restricting ourselves to linear scales, we compare the predictions for\ngalaxy-shear and shear-shear correlations of each modified gravity cosmology to\nthose of an effective Dark Energy cosmology with the same expansion history. In\nthis way, the effects of modified gravity on the growth of perturbations are\nseparated from the expansion history.

Through\npost-processing we investigate what kinds of feedback would be required to\nreproduce observed galaxy masses and star formation rates. To mimic an extreme\nform of \"preventive\" feedback (e.g., AGN radio mode) we remove all baryonic\nmass that was originally accreted via \"hot mode\" from shock-heated gas. This\ndoes not bring the high mass end of the galaxy mass function into agreement\nwith observations because much of the stellar mass in these systems formed at\nhigh redshift from baryons that originally accreted via \"cold mode\" onto lower\nmass progenitors. An efficient \"ejective\" feedback mechanism, such as supernova\ndriven winds, must reduce the masses of these progenitors.

However, if there is an\nadditional Sommerfeld enhancement in dwarfs, which have a velocity dispersion\n~10 to 20 times lower than that of the local Galactic halo, then the\ncross-sections for dark matter annihilating through $\\phi$'s required to\nexplain the excesses are very close to the cross-section upper bounds from\nWillman 1. Dark matter annihilation directly into $\\tau$'s is also marginally\nruled out by Willman 1 as an explanation of the excesses, and the required\ncross-section is only a factor of a few below the upper bound from Draco.\nFinally, we make predictions for the gamma-ray flux expected from the dwarf\ngalaxy Segue 1 for the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. We find that for a\nsizeable fraction of the parameter space in which dark matter annihilation into\ncharged leptons explains the PAMELA excess, Fermi has good prospects for\ndetecting a gamma-ray signal from Segue 1 after one year of observation. \n\n"}

These shifts persist for\ndark matter halos, and are a simple function of halo bias, with the shift\n(mostly) increasing with increasing bias. Extending our perturbation theory\nresults to halos with simple two parameter bias models (both in Lagrangian and\nEulerian space) quantitatively explains the observed shifts.

At z=0 for currently favored cosmologies, the matter\nshows shifts of ~0.5%, b=1 halos shift the acoustic scale by ~0.2%, while b=2\nhalos shift it by ~0.5%; these shifts decrease by the square of the growth\nfactor at higher redshifts.

If there is a superhorizon\nfluctuation in the curvaton field, then the rms amplitude of these\nperturbations will be asymmetric, and the asymmetry will be most apparent on\nlarge angular scales in the CMB. We find that it is only possible to generate\nthe observed asymmetry in the CMB while satisfying the quasar constraint if the\ncurvaton's contribution to the total dark matter density is small, but nonzero.\nThe model also requires that the majority of the primordial power comes from\nfluctuations in the inflaton field. Future observations and analyses of the CMB\nwill test this model because the power asymmetry generated by this model has a\nspecific spectrum, and the model requires that the current upper bounds on\nisocurvature power are nearly saturated. \n\n"}

Most observed dwarf\ngalaxies consists of a rotating stellar disc embedded in a massive DM halo with\na near constant-density core. Yet, models based on the CDM scenario invariably\nform galaxies with dense spheroidal stellar \"bulges\" and steep central DM\nprofiles, as low angular momentum baryons and DM sink to the center of galaxies\nthrough accretion and repeated mergers. Processes that decrease the central\ndensity of CDM halos have been identified, but have not yet reconciled theory\nwith observations of present day dwarfs. This failure is potentially\ncatastrophic for the CDM model, possibly requiring a different DM particle\ncandidate. This Letter presents new hydrodynamical simulations in a Lambda$CDM\nframework where analogues of dwarf galaxies, bulgeless and with a shallow\ncentral DM profile, are formed. This is achieved by resolving the inhomogeneous\ninterstellar medium, resulting in strong outflows from supernovae explosions\nwhich remove low angular momentum gas.

At present, groups contain most of the galaxies and a significant\nfraction of the overall baryon content of the universe. To explore the effects\nof BH feedback on groups, we analyse two high resolution cosmological hydro\nsimulations from the OverWhelmingly Large Simulations project. While both\ninclude galactic winds driven by supernovae, only one includes feedback from\nBHs. We compare the properties of the simulated groups to a wide range of\nobservational data, including hot gas radial profiles and gas mass fractions\n(fgas), luminosity-mass-temperature (L-M-T) scaling relations, K-band\nluminosity of the group and its central brightest galaxy (CBG), SFRs and ages\nof the CBG, and gas/stellar metallicities. Both runs yield entropy profiles\nsimilar to the data, while the run without AGN feedback yields highly peaked\ntemperature profiles, in discord with the observations. Energy input from BHs\nsignificantly reduces fgas for groups with masses less than ~10^14 Msun,\nyielding fgas-T and L-T relations that are in agreement with the data.

Performing such a transport along the null\ngeodesic of photons arriving from the galaxy, they found that the cosmological\nredshift is purely kinematic. Here we argue that one should rather transport\nthe velocity four-vector along the geodesic connecting the points of\nintersection of the world-lines of the galaxy and the observer with the\nhypersurface of constant cosmic time. We find that the resulting relation\nbetween the transported velocity and the redshift of arriving photons is not\ngiven by a relativistic Doppler formula. Instead, for small redshifts it\ncoincides with the well known non-relativistic decomposition of the redshift\ninto a Doppler (kinematic) component and a gravitational one. We perform such a\ndecomposition for arbitrary large redshifts and derive a formula for the\nkinematic component of the cosmological redshift, valid for any FLRW cosmology.\nIn particular, in a universe with Omega_m = 0.24 and Omega_Lambda = 0.76, a\nquasar at a redshift 6, at the time of emission of photons reaching us today\nhad the recession velocity v = 0.997c. This can be contrasted with v = 0.96c,\nhad the redshift been entirely kinematic. Thus, for recession velocities of\nsuch high-redshift sources, the effect of deceleration of the early Universe\nclearly prevails over the effect of its relatively recent acceleration. Last\nbut not least, we show that the so-called proper recession velocities of\ngalaxies, commonly used in cosmology, are in fact radial components of the\ngalaxies' four-velocity vectors. As such, they can indeed attain superluminal\nvalues, but should not be regarded as real velocities. \n\n"}

The AD mechanism predicts the formation of non-topological solitons,\nQ-balls, from which GWs are generated. Q-balls with large conserved charge $Q$\ncan produce a large amount of GWs. On the other hand, the decay rate of such\nQ-balls is so small that they may dominate the energy density of the universe,\nwhich implies that GWs are significantly diluted and that their frequencies are\nredshifted during Q-ball dominated era. Thus, the detectability of the GWs\nassociated with the formation of Q-balls is determined by these two competing\neffects. We find that there is a finite but small parameter region where such\nGWs may be detected by future detectors such as DECIGO or BBO, only in the case\nwhen the thermal logarithmic potential dominates the potential of the AD field.\nOtherwise GWs from Q-balls would not be detectable even by these futuristic\ndetectors: $\\Omega_{\\rm GW}^0<10^{-21}$.

Arp's loop is commonly interpreted as a\ntail resulting from the tidal interaction between M81 and M82. However, since\nits discovery the nature of this feature has remained controversial. Aims: Our\nprimary purpose was to identify the sources of optical and infrared emission\nobserved in Arp's loop. Methods: The morphology of the Arp's loop has been\ninvestigated with deep wide-field optical images. We also measured its colors\nusing IRAS and Spitzer-MIPS infrared images and compared them with those of the\ndisk of M81 and Galactic dust cirrus that fills the area where M81 is located.\nResults: Optical images reveal that this peculiar object has a filamentary\nstructure characterized by many dust features overlapping M81's field. The\nratios of far-infrared fluxes and the estimated dust-to-gas ratios indicate the\ninfrared emission of Arp's loop is dominated by the contribution of cold dust\nthat is most likely from Galactic cirrus. Conclusions: The above results\nsuggest that the light observed at optical wavelengths is a combination of\nemission from i) a few recent star forming regions located close to M81, where\nboth bright UV complexes and peaks in the HI distribution are found, ii) the\nextended disk of M81 and iii) scattered light from the same Galactic cirrus\nthat is responsible for the bulk of the far infrared emission. \n\n"}

The gravitational potential at\nthe position of particle i (x_i,y_i,z_i), induced by particle j at\n(x_j,y_j,z_j), is given by: phi_ij = -G m_j/|r_ij^2+e_i^2+e_j^2|^1/2, where G\nis the gravitational constant, m_j is the mass of particle j, r_ij =\n|(x_i-x_j)^2+(y_i-y_j)^2+(z_i-z_j)^2|^1/2 and e_i and e_j are the gravitational\nsoftening lengths of particles i and j, respectively. This form is formally an\nextension of the Newtonian potential to five dimensions. The derivative of this\nequation in the x,y, and z directions correspond to the gravitational\naccelerations in these directions and these are always symmetric between two\nparticles.\n  When one applies this potential to a group of particles with different\nsoftening lengths, as is the case with a tree code, an averaged gravitational\nsoftening length for the group can be used. We find that the most suitable\naveraged softening length for a group of particles is <e_j^2> = sum_j^N m_j\ne_j^2 / M, where M = sum_j^N m_j and N are the mass and number of all particles\nin the group, respectively. The leading error related to the softening length\nis O(sum_j r_j d(e_j^2)/r_ij^3), where r_j is the distance between particle j\nand the center of mass of the group and d(e_j^2) = e_j^2 - <e_j^2>. Using this\naveraged gravitational softening length with the tree method, one can use a\nsingle tree to evaluate the gravitational forces for a system of particles with\na wide variety of gravitational softening lengths. Consequently, this will\nreduce the calculation cost of the gravitational force for such a system with\ndifferent softenings without the need for complicated forms of softening.

The small object,\ntypically a stellar black hole (bh), emits significant amounts of GW along each\norbit in the detector bandwidth. The slowly, adiabatic inspiral of these\nsources will allow us to map space-time around MBHs in detail, as well as to\ntest our current conception of gravitation in the strong regime. The event rate\nof this kind of source has been addressed many times in the literature and the\nnumbers reported fluctuate by orders of magnitude. On the other hand, recent\nobservations of the Galactic center revealed a dearth of giant stars inside the\ninner parsec relative to the numbers theoretically expected for a fully relaxed\nstellar cusp. The possibility of unrelaxed nuclei (or, equivalently, with no or\nonly a very shallow cusp) adds substantial uncertainty to the estimates.

In this research note we re-assess the spectral\nresolution of the MILES stellar library and of the stellar population models\nbased on it. This exercise was performed, because of a recent controversy over\nthe exact MILES resolution. We perform our test through the comparison of MILES\nstellar spectra with three different sets of higher-resolution templates, one\nfully theoretical - the MARCS library - and two empirical ones, namely the\nIndo-U.S. and ELODIE v3.1 libraries. The theoretical template has a\nwell-defined very high (R=20000) resolution. Hence errors on this theoretical\nvalue do not affect our conclusions. Our approach based on the MARCS library\nwas crucial to constrain the values of the resolution also for the other two\nempirical templates. We find that the MILES resolution has previously been\nslightly overestimated. We derive a new spectral resolution of 2.54 A FWHM,\ninstead of the nominal 2.3 A. The reason for this difference is due to an\noverestimation of the resolution for the Indo-U.S. library that was previously\nused for estimates of the MILES resolution. For the Indo-U.S. we obtain a new\nvalue of 1.35 A FWHM. Most importantly, the results derived from the MARCS and\nELODIE libraries are in very good agreement.

We investigate supernovae\ntoo dim to have been discovered in cosmic surveys by a detailed study of all\nsupernova discoveries in the local volume. If possible supernova impostors are\nincluded, then dim supernovae are common enough by fraction to solve the\nsupernova rate problem. If they are not included, then the rate of dark core\ncollapses is likely substantial. Other alternatives are that there are\nsurprising changes in our understanding of star formation or supernova rates,\nincluding that supernovae form differently in small galaxies than in normal\ngalaxies. These possibilities can be distinguished by upcoming supernova\nsurveys, star formation measurements, searches for disappearing massive stars,\nand measurements of supernova neutrinos. \n\n"}

Measurement of this anisotropy by future 21cm surveys is a\npromising tool for separating cosmology from 21cm astrophysics. However,\nprevious attempts to model the signal have often neglected peculiar velocity or\nonly approximated it crudely.

The results of simulations show that the\npower-low index of the mass-density profile of the dark matter halo correlated\nwith the timescale of the mass loss, and it is flatter when the mass loss\noccurs over a short time than when it occurs over a long time. However, it is\nstill larger than typical observational values; in other words, the central\ncusp remains for any mass loss model in the simulations. Moreover, for the slow\nmass-loss case, the final density profile of the dark matter halo recovers the\nuniversal density profiles predicted by the CDM cosmology. Therefore, mass loss\ndriven by stellar feedback may not be an effective mechanism to flatten the\ncentral cusp. \n\n"}

To realize this\nidea in galaxies we use a particular DM cored profile that contains three\nparameters: a scale length (rs) and density (rho_0) of the halo, and a core\nradius (rc) stemming from the relativistic nature of the BDM model. We test\nthis model by fitting rotation curves of seventeen Low Surface Brightness\ngalaxies from The HI Nearby Galaxy Survey (THINGS). Since the energy Ec\nparameterizes the phase transition due to the underlying particle physics\nmodel, it is independent on the details of galaxy or structure formation and\ntherefore the DM profile parameters rs, rc, Ec are constrained, leaving only\ntwo free parameters. The high spatial and velocity resolution of this sample\nallows to derive the model parameters through the numerical implementation of\nthe chi^2-goodness-of-fit test to the mass models.

This is because its\nlarge exponential low-surface brightness envelope is not due to an old stellar\nhost but entirely due to extended nebular emission (ne) (Papaderos et al. 2002;\nP02). We study IZw18 and IZw18C down to an unprecedently faint surface\nbrightness level using HST ACS data.\n  We argue that the properties of IZw18C can be consistently accounted for by\npropagating star formation over the past ~100 Myr, in combination with stellar\ndiffusion and the associated radial stellar mass filtering effect (P02).\n  As for IZw18, we find that ne extends out to ~16 stellar scale lengths and\nprovides at least 1/3 of the total optical emission.\n  The case of IZw18 suggests caution in studies of distant galaxies in dominant\nstages of their evolution, rapidly assembling their stellar mass at high\nspecific star formation rates (SSFRs). It calls attention to the fact that ne\nis not necessarily cospatial with the underlying ionizing and non-ionizing\nstellar background, neither has to scale with its surface density. The\nprodigious energetic output during dominant phases of galaxy evolution may\nresult in large exponential ne envelopes, extending much beyond the still\ncompact stellar component, just like in IZw18. Therefore, the morphological\nparadigm of IZw18, while probably unique in the nearby Universe, may be\nubiquitous among high-SSFR galaxies at high redshift. Using IZw18 as reference,\nwe show that extended ne may introduce substantial observational biases and\nsignificantly affect fundamental galaxy relations. Among others, we show that\nthe surface brightness profiles of distant morphological analogs to IZw18 may\nbe barely distinguishable from Sersic profiles with an exponent 2<n<5, thus\nmimicking the profiles of massive galaxy spheroids.

In this way, we recognize a slowly rotating\ncentrally concentrated spheroid, and two disc components supported by rotation:\na thin disc with stars in nearly circular orbits, and a thick disc with orbital\nparameters transitional between the thin disc and the spheroid. The spheroidal\ncomponent is composed mainly by old, metal-poor and {\\alpha}-enhanced stars.\nThe distribution of metals in this component shows, however, a clear bimodality\nwith a low-metallicity peak, which could be related to a classical bulge, and a\nhigh-metallicity peak, which could be related to a pseudo-bulge.

Two common\ncomplementary approaches are Lyman-Break-Galaxy (LBG) surveys for large samples\nand Gamma-Ray-Burst (GRB) observations for sensitivity to SFR in small\ngalaxies. The z>4 GRB-inferred SFR is higher than the LBG rate, but this\ndifference is difficult to understand, as both methods rely on several modeling\nassumptions. Using a physically motivated galaxy luminosity function model,\nwith star formation in dark-matter halos with virial temperature Tvir>2e4 K\n(M_DM>2e8 M_sun), we show that GRB and LBG-derived SFRs are consistent if GRBs\nextend to faint galaxies (M_AB<-11). To test star formation below the detection\nlimit L_lim~0.05L^*_{z=3} of LBG surveys, we propose to measure the fraction\nf_det(L>L_lim,z) of GRB hosts with L>L_lim. This fraction quantifies the\nmissing star formation fraction in LBG surveys, constraining the\nmass-suppression scale for galaxy formation, with weak dependence on modeling\nassumptions. Because f_det(L>L_lim,z) corresponds to the ratio of star\nformation rates derived from LBG and GRB surveys, if these estimators are\nunbiased, measuring f_det(L>L_lim,z) also constrains the redshift evolution of\nthe GRB production rate per unit mass of star formation.

The survey has conducted a comprehensive census of massive\ngalaxies, their properties, environments, and large-scale structure down to\nabsolute magnitude M_B = -20 at z ~ 1 via ~90 nights of observation on the\nDEIMOS spectrograph at Keck Observatory. DEEP2 covers an area of 2.8 deg^2\ndivided into four separate fields, observed to a limiting apparent magnitude of\nR_AB=24.1. Objects with z < 0.7 are rejected based on BRI photometry in three\nof the four DEEP2 fields, allowing galaxies with z > 0.7 to be targeted ~2.5\ntimes more efficiently than in a purely magnitude-limited sample. Approximately\nsixty percent of eligible targets are chosen for spectroscopy, yielding nearly\n53,000 spectra and more than 38,000 reliable redshift measurements. Most of the\ntargets which fail to yield secure redshifts are blue objects that lie beyond z\n~ 1.45.

The abundances of SLRs in the gas\nof a star-forming galaxy are inversely proportional to the gas consumption\ntime. The rapid evolution of specific star formation rate (SSFR) of normal\ngalaxies implies they had mean SLR abundances ~3--10 times higher at z = 2.\nDuring the epoch of Solar system formation, the background SLR abundances of\nthe Galaxy were up to twice as high as at present, if SLR yields from massive\nstars do not depend on metallicity. If SLRs are homogenized in the gas of\ngalaxies, the high SSFRs of normal galaxies can partly explain the elevated\nabundance of SLRs like $^{60}$Fe and $^{26}$Al in the early Solar system.\nStarburst galaxies have much higher SSFRs still, and have enormous mean\nabundances of $^{26}$Al ($^{26}$Al/$^{27}$Al ~ $10^{-3}$ for Solar metallicity\ngas). The main uncertainty is whether the SLRs are mixed with the star-forming\nmolecular gas: they could be trapped in hot gas and decay before entering the\ncolder phases, or be blown out by starburst winds.

However,\nprevious analyses assumed that the IGM was uniformly ionized outside of the\nquasar's HII region. Here we relax this assumption and model patchy\nreionization scenarios for a range of IGM and quasar parameters. We quantify\nthe impact of these differences on the inferred x_HI, by fitting the spectra of\nthree quasars: SDSS J1148+5251 (z=6.419), J1030+0524 (z=6.308), and J1623+3112\n(z=6.247). We find that the best-fit values of x_HI in the patchy models agree\nwell with the uniform case. More importantly, we confirm that the observed\nspectra favor the presence of a GP damping wing, with peak likelihoods\ndecreasing by factors of > few - 10 when the spectra are modeled without a\ndamping wing. We also find that the Ly alpha absorption spectra, by themselves,\ncannot distinguish the damping wing in a relatively neutral IGM from a damping\nwing in a highly ionized IGM, caused either by an isolated neutral patch, or by\na damped Ly alpha absorber (DLA). However, neutral patches in a highly ionized\nuniverse (x_HI < 0.01), and DLAs with the large required column densities (N_HI\n> few x 10^{20} cm^{-2}) are both rare. As a result, when we include reasonable\nprior probabilities for the line of sight (LOS) to intercept either a neutral\npatch or a DLA at the required distance of ~ 40-60 comoving Mpc away from the\nquasar, we find strong lower limits on the neutral fraction in the IGM, x_HI >\n0.1 (at 95% confidence).

An accurate theoretical modelling of their effect during\nthe non-linear regime of structure formation is required in order to properly\nanalyse current and upcoming high-precision large-scale structure data, and\nconstrain the neutrino mass. Taking advantage of the fact that massive\nneutrinos remain linearly clustered up to late times, this paper treats the\nlinear growth of neutrino overdensities in a non-linear CDM background. The\nevolution of the CDM component is obtained via N-body computations. The smooth\nneutrino component is evaluated from that background by solving the Boltzmann\nequation linearised with respect to the neutrino overdensity. CDM and neutrinos\nare simultaneously evolved in time, consistently accounting for their mutual\ngravitational influence. This method avoids the issue of shot-noise inherent to\nparticle-based neutrino simulations, and, in contrast with standard\nFourier-space methods, properly accounts for the non-linear potential wells in\nwhich the neutrinos evolve. Inside the most massive late-time clusters, where\nthe escape velocity is larger than the neutrino thermal velocity, neutrinos can\nclump non-linearly, causing the method to formally break down. It is shown that\nthis does not affect the total matter power spectrum, which can be very\naccurately computed on all relevant scales up to the present time. \n\n"}

We have analyzed archival spectroscopic observations of\nMarkarian 3 taken over the last 12 years with the XMM-Newton, Suzaku and Swift\nobservatories, as well as data taken during a monitoring campaign activated by\nus in 2012.

This upper limit\nimproves by more than a factor of 15 previous estimates of the\nCompton-reflection variability timescale for this source. When the light curve\nof the Compton-reflection continuum in the 4-5 keV band is correlated with the\n15-150 keV Swift/BAT curve a delay ~1200 days is found. The cross-correlation\nresults are dependent on the model used to fit the spectra, although the\ndetection of the Compton-reflection component variability is independent of the\nrange of models employed to fit the data.

Filtering cannot imprint a\nsignal with the mentioned properties at cluster positions; however, an\ninadequately designed filter can greatly suppress such a signal.

Instead, we propose that local\nelliptical galaxies generically contain three subcomponents: a compact (R_e < 1\nkpc) inner component with luminosity fraction f ~ 0.1-0.15; an\nintermediate-scale (R_e ~ 2.5 kpc) middle component with f ~ 0.2-0.25; and a\ndominant (f = 0.6), extended (R_e ~ 10 kpc) outer envelope.

The individual subcomponents\nfollow well-defined photometric scaling relations and the stellar mass-size\nrelation.

Metal loss through galactic winds is\nalso commonly invoked to explain the low metal content of dwarf galaxies.

The properties of such\nPopulation III (Pop III) stars are thought to be very different than later\ngenerations, because cooling is dramatically different in gas with a\nmetallicity below a critical value Z_c, which lies between ~10^-6 and 10^-3\nsolar value. Z_c is much smaller than the typical average metallicity, <Z>, and\nthus the mixing efficiency of the pristine gas in the interstellar medium plays\na crucial role in the transition from Pop III to normal star formation. The\nsmall critical value, Z_c, corresponds to the far left tail of the probability\ndistribution function (PDF) of the metallicity. Based on closure models for the\nPDF formulation of turbulent mixing, we derive equations for the fraction of\ngas, P, lying below Z_c, in compressible turbulence. Our simulation data shows\nthat the evolution of the fraction P can be well approximated by a generalized\nself-convolution model, which predicts dP/dt = -n/tau_con P (1-P^(1/n)), where\nn is a measure of the locality of the PDF convolution and the timescale tau_con\nis determined by the rate at which turbulence stretches the pollutants.

The characteristic\namplitude of density perturbations is linearly related to the strength of\nturbulence, i.e. the 3D Mach number, as A(k)_max = 0.25 M. The slope of A(k) in\nturn reflects the level of conduction. In a non-conductive medium, subsonic\nstirring motions advect density with a similar nearly Kolmogorov cascade.\nIncreasing conduction (via magnetic suppression f = 0.001-1) progressively\nsteepens the spectrum towards the Burgers-like regime. The turbulent Prandtl\nnumber defines the dynamic similarity of the flow; at scales where Pt < 100,\nthe spectrum develops a significant decay. The transition is gentle for highly\nsuppressed conduction, f < 0.001, while sharp in the opposite regime.

This makes halos that\ncollapse at $z \\lesssim 1$ feel an overall weaker gravity, which suppresses\nhalo formation. However, the matter density in the Quartic model is higher than\nin standard $\\Lambda$CDM, which boosts structure formation and dominates over\nthe effect of the weaker gravity. In the Quartic model there is a significant\noverabundance of high-mass halos relative to $\\Lambda$CDM.

The existing tension between Planck determination of these\nparameters in the frame of the base LambdaCDM model and their direct\nmeasurements generated lively discussions and several interpretations. In this\npaper we quantify this tension by exploring several extensions of the base\nLambdaCDM model that include the leptonic asymmetry. We set bounds on the\nradiation content of the Universe and neutrino properties by using the latest\ncosmological measurements, imposing also self-consistent BBN constraints on the\nprimordial helium abundance. For all cosmological asymmetric models we find the\npreference of cosmological data for smaller values of active and sterile\nneutrino masses.

When combining\nthis fact with the motivation from fundamental theory for shift-symmetric\nscalars (moduli) prior to SUSY breaking, this leads to a non-thermal history\nfor the early universe. Such a history implies different expectations for the\nmicroscopic properties of dark matter, as well as the possibility of dark\nradiation and a cosmic axion background. In this paper we examine how\ncorrelated and mixed isocurvature perturbations are generated in such models,\nas well as the connection to dark radiation. WMAP constraints on multiple\ncorrelated isocurvature modes allow up to half of the primordial perturbations\nto be isocurvature, contrary to the case of a single isocurvature mode where\nperturbations must be dominantly adiabatic. However, such bounds are strongly\nprior dependent, and have not been investigated with the latest Planck data. In\nthis paper we use the example of a SUSY non-thermal history to establish\ntheoretical priors on cosmological parameters. Of particular interest, we find\nthat priors on dark radiation are degenerate with those on the total amount of\nisocurvature -- they are inversely correlated. Dark radiation is tightly\nconstrained in the early universe and has been used recently to place stringent\nconstraints on string-based approaches to beyond the standard model. Our\nresults suggest such constraints can require more input from theory. Data from\ncosmological probes -- such as Planck -- can help guide model building in\nmodels of the MSSM, split-SUSY, and beyond.

Never mind the\n  gaps: comparing techniques to restore homogeneous sky coverage Abstract: [Abridged] Non-uniform sampling and gaps in sky coverage are common in galaxy\nredshift surveys, but these effects can degrade galaxy counts-in-cells and\ndensity estimates. We carry out a comparison of methods that aim to fill the\ngaps to correct for the systematic effects. Our study is motivated by the\nanalysis of the VIMOS Extragalactic Redshift Survey (VIPERS), a flux-limited\nsurvey (i<22.5) based on one-pass observations with VIMOS, with gaps covering\n25% of the surveyed area and a mean sampling rate of 35%. Our findings are\napplicable to other surveys with similar observing strategies. We compare 1)\ntwo algorithms based on photometric redshift, that assign redshifts to galaxies\nbased on the spectroscopic redshifts of the nearest neighbours, 2) two Bayesian\nmethods, the Wiener filter and the Poisson-Lognormal filter. Using galaxy mock\ncatalogues we quantify the accuracy of the counts-in-cells measurements on\nscales of R=5 and 8 Mpc/h after applying each of these methods. We also study\nhow they perform to account for spectroscopic redshift error and inhomogeneous\nand sparse sampling rate. We find that in VIPERS the errors in counts-in-cells\nmeasurements on R<10 Mpc/h scales are dominated by the sparseness of the\nsample. All methods underpredict by 20-35% the counts at high densities. This\nsystematic bias is of the same order as random errors. No method outperforms\nthe others. Random and systematic errors decrease for larger cells. We show\nthat it is possible to separate the lowest and highest densities on scales of 5\nMpc/h at redshifts 0.5<z<1.1, over a large volume such as in VIPERS survey.\nThis is vital for the characterisation of cosmic variance and rare populations\n(e.g, brightest galaxies) in environmental studies at these redshifts. \n\n"}

M87 and its Globular\n  Clusters Abstract: We study the Globular Cluster (GC) system of the nearby elliptical galaxy M87\nusing the newly available dataset with accurate kinematics (Strader et\nal.2011). We find evidence for three distinct sub-populations of GCs in terms\nof colours, kinematics and radial profiles. We show that a decomposition into\nthree populations (blue, intermediate and red GCs) is statistically preferred\nto one with two or four populations, and relate them to the stellar profile. We\nexploit the sub-populations to derive dynamical constraints on the mass and\nDark Matter (DM) content of M87 out to $\\sim100$ kpc. We use a class of global\nmass-estimators (from Paper I), obtaining mass measurements at different\nlocations. M87's DM fraction changes from $\\approx$0.2 at the starlight's\neffective radius (6 kpc) to $\\approx$0.95 at the distance probed by the most\nextended, blue GCs (135 kpc). We supplement this with \\textit{virial\ndecompositions}, exploiting the dynamical model to produce a separation into\nmultiple components.

The distance correlation\nmeasure offers a more precise alternative to the classical measure since it is\ncapable of detecting nonlinear relationships that may appear in astrophysical\napplications.

Using high-resolution 3D plasma simulations, we study the statistics\nof the velocity field and its relation with the thermodynamic perturbations.\nThe normalization of the ICM spectrum (density, entropy, or pressure) is\nlinearly tied to the level of large-scale motions, which excite both gravity\nand sound waves due to stratification. For low 3D Mach number M~0.25, gravity\nwaves mainly drive entropy perturbations, traced by preferentially tangential\nturbulence. For M>0.5, sound waves start to significantly contribute, passing\nthe leading role to compressive pressure fluctuations, associated with\nisotropic (or slightly radial) turbulence. Density and temperature fluctuations\nare then characterized by the dominant process: isobaric (low M), adiabatic\n(high M), or isothermal (strong conduction). Most clusters reside in the\nintermediate regime, showing a mixture of gravity and sound waves, hence\ndrifting towards isotropic velocities. Remarkably, regardless of the regime,\nthe variance of density perturbations is comparable to the 1D Mach number. This\nlinear relation allows to easily convert between gas motions and ICM\nperturbations, which can be exploited by Chandra, XMM data and by the\nforthcoming Astro-H. At intermediate and small scales (10-100 kpc), the\nturbulent velocities develop a Kolmogorov cascade. The thermodynamic\nperturbations act as effective tracers of the velocity field, broadly\nconsistent with the Kolmogorov-Obukhov-Corrsin advection theory. Thermal\nconduction acts to damp the gas fluctuations, washing out the filamentary\nstructures and steepening the spectrum, while leaving unaltered the velocity\ncascade.

Second, we used a Bayesian formalism (introduced by Treu et al.\n2012) that compares the z>7 galaxy spectra to models of the Lyman-alpha\nequivalent width (WLy{\\alpha}) distribution at z~6. We explored two simple\nevolutionary scenarios: smooth evolution where Lyman-alpha is attenuated in all\ngalaxies by a constant factor (perhaps owing to processes from galaxy evolution\nor a slowly increasing IGM opacity), and patchy evolution where Lyman-alpha is\nblocked in some fraction of galaxies (perhaps due to the IGM being opaque along\nonly some fraction of sightlines).

The\ndevelopment of theoretical models beyond \\Lambda, or smooth dark energy, often\ncalled modified gravity, has led to broader insights into a path forward, and a\nhost of observational and experimental tests have been developed. In this\nreview we present the current state of the field and describe a framework for\nanticipating developments in the next decade. We identify the guiding\nprinciples for rigorous and consistent modifications of the standard model, and\ndiscuss the prospects for empirical tests. We begin by reviewing attempts to\nconsistently modify Einstein gravity in the infrared, focusing on the notion\nthat additional degrees of freedom introduced by the modification must screen\nthemselves from local tests of gravity. We categorize screening mechanisms into\nthree broad classes: mechanisms which become active in regions of high\nNewtonian potential, those in which first derivatives become important, and\nthose for which second derivatives are important. Examples of the first class,\nsuch as f(R) gravity, employ the familiar chameleon or symmetron mechanisms,\nwhereas examples of the last class are galileon and massive gravity theories,\nemploying the Vainshtein mechanism. In each case, we describe the theories as\neffective theories. We describe experimental tests, summarizing laboratory and\nsolar system tests and describing in some detail astrophysical and cosmological\ntests. We discuss future tests which will be sensitive to different signatures\nof new physics in the gravitational sector. Parts that are more relevant to\ntheorists vs. observers/experimentalists are clearly indicated, in the hope\nthat this will serve as a useful reference for both audiences, as well as\nhelping those interested in bridging the gap between them. \n\n"}

At a redshift of z=0.7403, derived from narrow absorption lines,\niPTF13ajg peaked at an absolute magnitude M(u,AB)=-22.5, one of the most\nluminous supernovae to date. The uBgRiz light curves, obtained with the P48,\nP60, NOT, DCT, and Keck telescopes, and the nine-epoch spectral sequence\nsecured with the Keck and the VLT (covering 3 rest-frame months), are tied\ntogether photometrically to provide an estimate of the flux evolution as a\nfunction of time and wavelength. The observed bolometric peak luminosity of\niPTF13ajg is 3.2x10^44 erg/s, while the estimated total radiated energy is\n1.3x10^51 erg. We detect narrow absorption lines of Mg I, Mg II, and Fe II,\nassociated with the cold interstellar medium in the host galaxy, at two\ndifferent epochs with X-shooter at the VLT. From Voigt-profile fitting, we\nderive the column densities log N(Mg I)=11.94+-0.06, log N(Mg II)=14.7+-0.3,\nand log N(Fe II)=14.25+-0.10. These column densities, as well as the Mg I and\nMg II equivalent widths of a sample of hydrogen-poor SLSNe taken from the\nliterature, are at the low end of those derived for gamma-ray bursts (GRBs),\nwhose progenitors are also thought to be massive stars. This suggests that the\nenvironments of SLSNe and GRBs are different.

Photoheating helps to suppress star formation in\nlow-mass galaxies, but its impact on the cosmic SFR is small.

Photoheating does provide a strong positive\nfeedback on reionization because it smooths density fluctuations in the IGM,\nwhich lowers the IGM recombination rate substantially.

Yet, real dark matter halos in N-body simulations are known to\nviolate the assumption that virial mass determines the configuration space\ndistribution, an effect known as assembly bias.

With each halo simulated at three levels of increasing\nresolution, the highest reaching a baryon mass resolution of ~10,000 solar\nmasses, we study the interaction of filamentary inflow and the quasi-static hot\nhalo atmosphere. We highlight the discrepancy between the spatial resolution\navailable in the halo gas as opposed to within the galaxy itself, and find that\nstream morphologies become increasingly complex at higher resolution, with\nlarge coherent flows revealing density and temperature structure at\nprogressively smaller scales. Moreover, multiple gas components co-exist at the\nsame radius within the halo, making radially averaged analyses misleading. This\nis particularly true where the hot, quasi-static, high entropy halo atmosphere\ninteracts with cold, rapidly inflowing, low entropy accretion. We investigate\nthe process of gas virialization and identify different regimes for the heating\nof gas as it accretes from the intergalactic medium.

In practice, to infer the reduced shear, weak\nlensing measures galaxy shapes, which are the consequence of both the intrinsic\nellipticity of the sources and of the integrated gravitational lensing effect\nalong the line of sight. Hence, a very large number of galaxies is required in\norder to average over their individual properties and to isolate the weak\nlensing cosmic shear signal. If this `shape noise' can be reduced, significant\nadvances in the power of a weak lensing surveys can be expected. This paper\ndescribes a general method for extracting the probability distributions of\nparameters from catalogues of data using Voronoi cells, which has several\napplications, and has synergies with Bayesian hierarchical modelling\napproaches.

If a gamma-ray source\nwithout detectable emission at other wavelengths were unambiguously determined\nto be spatially extended, it could not be explained by known astrophysics, and\nwould constitute a smoking gun for dark matter particles annihilating in a\nnearby subhalo. With this prospect in mind, we scrutinize the gamma-ray\nemission from this source, finding that it prefers a spatially extended profile\nover that of a single point-like source with 5.1 sigma statistical\nsignificance. We also use a large sample of active galactic nuclei and other\nknown gamma-rays sources as a control group, confirming, as expected, that\nstatistically significant extension is rare among such objects. We argue that\nthe most likely (non-dark matter) explanation for this apparent extension is a\npair of bright gamma-ray sources that serendipitously lie very close to each\nother, and estimate that there is a chance probability of ~2% that such a pair\nwould exist somewhere on the sky.

Based on\nthe assumption of this energy equipartition, we determine the galactic\nsynchrotron flux as a function of redshift z. The conditions in the early\nUniverse are different from the present day, in particular the galaxies have\nmore intense star formation. To cover a large range of conditions we consider\nmodels based on two different systems: one model galaxy comparable to the Milky\nWay and one typical high-z starburst galaxy.

We show that\nthe radial mixing of stars drives a positive vertical metallicity gradient in\nthe thin disc. On the other hand, if the initial thin disc is flared, with\nvertical scale-height increasing with galactocentric radius, the metal poor\nstars originally in the outer disc become dominant in regions above the disc\nplane at every radii. This process can drive a negative vertical metallicity\ngradient, which is consistent with the current observed trend. This model\nmimics a scenario where the star-forming thin disc was flared in the outer\nregion at earlier epochs. Our numerical experiment with an initial flared disc\npredicts that the negative vertical metallicity gradient of the mono-age\nrelatively young thin disc population should be steeper in the inner disc, and\nthe radial metallicity gradient of the mono-age population should be shallower\nat greater heights above the disc plane.

These tests are important\ndiagnostics for currently ongoing and planned cosmic shear surveys, as such\nbiases induce coherent shear patterns that can mimic and potentially bias the\ncosmic shear signal. The central idea of these tests is to determine the\naverage ellipticity of all galaxies with shape measurements in a grid in the\npixel plane. The distribution of the absolute values of these averaged\nellipticities can be compared to randomized catalogues; a difference points to\nsystematics in the data. In addition, we introduce a method to quantify the\nspatial correlation of the additive bias, which suppresses the contribution\nfrom cosmic shear and therefore eases the identification of a\nposition-dependent additive shear bias in the data. We apply these tests to the\npublicly available shear catalogues from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope\nLensing Survey (CFHTLenS) and the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS) and find evidence\nfor a small but non-negligible residual additive bias at small scales. As this\nresidual bias is smaller than the error on the shear correlation signal at\nthose scales, it is highly unlikely that it causes a significant bias in the\npublished cosmic shear results of CFHTLenS. In CFHTLenS, the amplitude of this\nsystematic signal is consistent with zero in fields where the number of stars\nused to model the PSF is higher than average, suggesting that the\nposition-dependent additive shear bias originates from undersampled PSF\nvariations across the image. \n\n"}

Velocity estimates within the intracluster medium (ICM) can be\nobtained via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect, but its observation is\nchallenging both in term of sensitivity requirement and control of systematic\neffects, including the removal of contaminants. In this paper we report\nresolved observations, at 150 and 260 GHz, of the SZ effect toward the triple\nmerger MACS J0717.5+3745 (z=0.55), using data obtained with the NIKA camera at\nthe IRAM 30m telescope. Assuming that the SZ signal is the sum of a thermal\n(tSZ) and a kinetic (kSZ) component and by combining the two NIKA bands, we\nextract for the first time a resolved map of the kSZ signal in a cluster. The\nkSZ signal is dominated by a dipolar structure that peaks at -5.1 and +3.4\nsigma, corresponding to two subclusters moving respectively away and toward us\nand coincident with the cold dense X-ray core and a hot region undergoing a\nmajor merging event. We model the gas electron density and line-of-sight\nvelocity of MACS J0717.5+3745 as four subclusters. Combining NIKA data with\nX-ray observations from XMM-Newton and Chandra, we fit this model to constrain\nthe gas line-of-sight velocity of each component, and we also derive, for the\nfirst time, a velocity map from kSZ data (i.e. that is model-dependent). Our\nresults are consistent with previous constraints on the merger velocities, and\nthanks to the high angular resolution of our data, we are able to resolve the\nstructure of the gas velocity. Finally, we investigate possible contamination\nand systematic effects with a special care given to radio and submillimeter\ngalaxies.

We model these fluctuations using a hybrid approach\nutilizing the large volume Millennium simulation to predict the spatial\ndistribution of QSOs combined with smaller scale full hydrodynamical simulation\nperformed with RAMSES and post-processed with the radiative transfer code ATON.\nWe produce realictic mock absorption spectra that account for the contribution\nof galaxies and QSOs to the ionising UV background. This improved models\nconfirm our earlier findings that a significant ($\\ge$50%) contribution of\nionising photons from QSOs can explain the large reported opacity fluctuations\non large scales. The inferred QSO luminosity function is thereby consistent\nwith recent estimates of the space density of QSOs at this redshift.

We summarize Gaia DR1 and provide\nillustrations of the scientific quality of the data, followed by a discussion\nof the limitations due to the preliminary nature of this release. Gaia DR1\nconsists of: a primary astrometric data set which contains the positions,\nparallaxes, and mean proper motions for about 2 million of the brightest stars\nin common with the Hipparcos and Tycho-2 catalogues and a secondary astrometric\ndata set containing the positions for an additional 1.1 billion sources. The\nsecond component is the photometric data set,consisting of mean G-band\nmagnitudes for all sources. The G-band light curves and the characteristics of\n~3000 Cepheid and RR Lyrae stars, observed at high cadence around the south\necliptic pole, form the third component. For the primary astrometric data set\nthe typical uncertainty is about 0.3 mas for the positions and parallaxes, and\nabout 1 mas/yr for the proper motions. A systematic component of ~0.3 mas\nshould be added to the parallax uncertainties. For the subset of ~94000\nHipparcos stars in the primary data set, the proper motions are much more\nprecise at about 0.06 mas/yr. For the secondary astrometric data set, the\ntypical uncertainty of the positions is ~10 mas. The median uncertainties on\nthe mean G-band magnitudes range from the mmag level to ~0.03 mag over the\nmagnitude range 5 to 20.7. Gaia DR1 represents a major advance in the mapping\nof the heavens and the availability of basic stellar data that underpin\nobservational astrophysics. Nevertheless, the very preliminary nature of this\nfirst Gaia data release does lead to a number of important limitations to the\ndata quality which should be carefully considered before drawing conclusions\nfrom the data. \n\n"}

Unfortunately, NMT systems are\nknown to be computationally expensive both in training and in translation\ninference. Also, most NMT systems have difficulty with rare words. These issues\nhave hindered NMT's use in practical deployments and services, where both\naccuracy and speed are essential. In this work, we present GNMT, Google's\nNeural Machine Translation system, which attempts to address many of these\nissues. Our model consists of a deep LSTM network with 8 encoder and 8 decoder\nlayers using attention and residual connections. To improve parallelism and\ntherefore decrease training time, our attention mechanism connects the bottom\nlayer of the decoder to the top layer of the encoder. To accelerate the final\ntranslation speed, we employ low-precision arithmetic during inference\ncomputations. To improve handling of rare words, we divide words into a limited\nset of common sub-word units (\"wordpieces\") for both input and output. This\nmethod provides a good balance between the flexibility of \"character\"-delimited\nmodels and the efficiency of \"word\"-delimited models, naturally handles\ntranslation of rare words, and ultimately improves the overall accuracy of the\nsystem.

The magnetic pressure elevates most of the gas carrying the accretion\nflow at $R$ to large heights $z > 0.1 R$ and low densities, while leaving a\nthin dense layer containing most of the mass --- but contributing very little\naccretion --- around the equator.

We quantify, for the first time,\nthe impact of magnification uncertainties on LF results and thus provide more\nrealistic constraints than other recent work.

One\npublic magnification model is used to construct a mock high-redshift galaxy\nsample that is then analyzed using the other magnification models to construct\na LF.

Abstract: Recent spatially resolved observations of galaxies at z=0.6-3 reveal that\nhigh-redshift galaxies show complex kinematics and a broad distribution of\ngas-phase metallicity gradients. To understand these results, we use a suite of\nhigh-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations from the Feedback in Realistic\nEnvironments (FIRE) project, which include physically motivated models of the\nmulti-phase ISM, star formation, and stellar feedback. Our simulations\nreproduce the observed diversity of kinematic properties and metallicity\ngradients, broadly consistent with observations at z=0-3. Strong negative\nmetallicity gradients only appear in galaxies with a rotating disk, but not all\nrotationally supported galaxies have significant gradients. Strongly perturbed\ngalaxies with little rotation always have flat gradients. The kinematic\nproperties and metallicity gradient of a high-redshift galaxy can vary\nsignificantly on short time-scales, associated with starburst episodes.\nFeedback from a starburst can destroy the gas disk, drive strong outflows, and\nflatten a pre-existing negative metallicity gradient. The time variability of a\nsingle galaxy is statistically similar to the entire simulated sample,\nindicating that the observed metallicity gradients in high-redshift galaxies\nreflect the instantaneous state of the galaxy rather than the accretion and\ngrowth history on cosmological time-scales. We find weak dependence of\nmetallicity gradient on stellar mass and specific star formation rate (sSFR).\nLow-mass galaxies and galaxies with high sSFR tend to have flat gradients,\nlikely due to the fact that feedback is more efficient in these galaxies. We\nargue that it is important to resolve feedback on small scales in order to\nproduce the diverse metallicity gradients observed. \n\n"}

On very large scales this tracer bias results in a constant\noffset in the clustering amplitude, known as linear bias. Towards smaller\nnonlinear scales, this is no longer the case and tracer bias becomes a\ncomplicated function of scale and time. We focus on tracer bias centred on\ncosmic voids, depressions of the density field that spatially dominate the\nuniverse. We consider three types of tracers: galaxies, galaxy clusters and\nAGN, extracted from the hydrodynamical simulation Magneticum Pathfinder. In\ncontrast to common clustering statistics that focus on auto-correlations of\ntracers, we find that void-tracer cross-correlations are successfully described\nby a linear-bias relation.

This conceptually novel approach combines the advantages of both\nmachine-learning and template-fitting methods by building template SEDs\ndirectly from the training data. This is made computationally tractable with\nGaussian Processes operating in flux--redshift space, encoding the physics of\nredshift and the projection of galaxy SEDs onto photometric band passes. This\nmethod alleviates the need of acquiring representative training data or\nconstructing detailed galaxy SED models; it requires only that the photometric\nband passes and calibrations be known or have parameterized unknowns. The\ntraining data can consist of a combination of spectroscopic and deep many-band\nphotometric data, which do not need to entirely spatially overlap with the\ntarget survey of interest or even involve the same photometric bands.

In this paper we use SDSS\nspectrophotometry to explore the systematics of the correlation using the\n[OIII]5007 lines instead of Halpha or Hbeta to measure luminosities and line\nwidths. We also examine possible systematic effects involved in measuring the\nprofile-widths and the luminosities through different apertures.

For lensing system as an\nisolated astrophysical object, we derive the dark energy contribution to\ngravitational potential as a repulsive power-law term, containing a generic\nequation of state parameter $w$. We find that it generates $w$-dependent and\nposition-dependent modification to the conventional light orbital equation of\n$w=-1$. With post-Newtonian approximation, we compute its direct effect for an\nisolated lensing system at astrophysical scales and find that the dark energy\nforce can deflect the path of incident light rays. We demonstrate that the\ndark-energy-induced deflection angle $\\Delta\\alpha_{DE}^{}\\propto\nM^{(1+\\frac{1}{3w})}$ (with $1+\\frac{1}{3w}>0$), which increases with the\nlensing mass $M$ and consistently approaches zero in the limit $M \\to 0$.

Thus, here we apply our self-consistent\nN-body/hydro-dynamical code (based on FLASH) to model this binary cluster\nencounter.

Therefore, they could not\nself-consistently predict their final masses at collapse, or those of the\nresulting supermassive black hole seeds, but rather invoked comparison to\nsimple polytropic models. Here, we systematically examine the birth, evolution\nand collapse of accreting non-rotating supermassive stars under accretion rates\nof 0.01-10 solar masses per year, using the stellar evolution code KEPLER. Our\napproach includes post-Newtonian corrections to the stellar structure and an\nadaptive nuclear network, and can transition to following the hydrodynamic\nevolution of supermassive stars after they encounter the general relativistic\ninstability. We find that this instability triggers the collapse of the star at\nmasses of 150,000-330,000 solar masses for accretion rates of 0.1-10 solar\nmasses per year, and that the final mass of the star scales roughly\nlogarithmically with the rate.

The details of this suppression depend on the DM\nparticle nature, allowing for a direct link between DM models and astrophysical\nobservations. However, most of the astrophysical constraints obtained so far\nrefer to a very specific shape of the power suppression, corresponding to\nthermal warm dark matter (WDM), i.e., candidates with a Fermi-Dirac or\nBose-Einstein momentum distribution. In this work we introduce a new analytical\nfitting formula for the power spectrum, which is simple yet flexible enough to\nreproduce the clustering signal of large classes of non-thermal DM models,\nwhich are not at all adequately described by the oversimplified notion of WDM.\nWe show that the formula is able to fully cover the parameter space of sterile\nneutrinos (whether resonantly produced or from particle decay), mixed cold and\nwarm models, fuzzy dark matter, as well as other models suggested by effective\ntheory of structure formation (ETHOS).

Such cosmic regions\nare identified around local extrema in the density field and admit a unique\ncompensation radius $R_1$ where the internal spherical mass is exactly\ncompensated. Their origin is studied by extending the standard peak model and\nimplementing the compensation condition. Since the compensation radius evolves\nas the Universe itself, $R_1(t)\\propto a(t)$, CoSpheres behave as bubble\nUniverses with fixed comoving volume. Using the spherical collapse model, we\nreconstruct their profiles with a very high accuracy until $z=0$ in N-body\nsimulations.

For the larger boxes of size 500 Mpc, it is very\ndifficult to distinguish them visually. The agreement of the power spectrum\n$P_k$ is 1-2\\% for most of the range, between $k=0.06$ and $k=0.4$. An\nimportant advantage of generating cosmic web realizations with a GAN is the\nconsiderable gains in terms of computation time. Each new sample generated by a\nGAN takes a fraction of a second, compared to the many hours needed by\ntraditional N-body techniques. We anticipate that the use of generative models\nsuch as GANs will therefore play an important role in providing extremely fast\nand precise simulations of cosmic web in the era of large cosmological surveys,\nsuch as Euclid and Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). \n\n"}

However, the absorption depth\nreported by EDGES is more than twice the maximal value expected in the standard\ncosmological model, at $\\approx 3.8\\sigma$ significance. Here, we propose an\nexplanation for this depth based on \"early dark energy\" (EDE), a scenario in\nwhich an additional component with equation of state $w=-1$ contributes to the\ncosmological energy density at early times, before decaying rapidly at a\ncritical redshift, $z_c$.

Moreover, the EDE models\nneeded to explain the EDGES signal exacerbate the current tension in low- and\nhigh-redshift measurements of the Hubble constant.

However, their\ndetection is sensitive to radiative transfer effects that depend on local\nastrophysical conditions.

The two\nmost promising effective models for early universe cosmology, inflation and\nekpyrosis, are mechanisms that, in order to address cosmological puzzles, must\noperate over vast expansion/energy ranges. This suggests that it might be\nappropriate to describe them using scaling laws. Here we combine these two\nideas and demonstrate that they drive inflation and ekpyrosis to their\nextremes: inflation must start at ultra-slow-roll, and ekpyrosis at\nultra-fast-roll. At face value, the implied spectra are overly tilted to the\nred, although in both cases minor departures from pure scale freedom bring the\nspectral indices within current observational bounds. These models predict a\nsignificant spectral running at a level detectable in the near future\n($\\alpha_s \\approx -10^{-3}$).

However there are\ntheoretical reasons to prefer a period of earlier matter domination, prior to\nnucleosynthesis, e.g. due to late decaying massive particles needed to explain\nbaryogenesis. Axion cosmology is quantitatively affected by an early period of\nmatter domination, with a different axion mass range preferred and greater\ninhomogeneity produced on small scales. In this work we show that such\nincreased inhomogeneity can lead to the formation of axion miniclusters in\naxion parameter ranges that are different from those usually assumed. If the\nreheating temperature is below $58$ MeV, axion miniclusters can form even if\nthe axion field is present during inflation and has been previously\nhomogenized.

The amplitude and shape of the resulting light curve\nis sensitive to the planet's radius and orbital inclination, as well as the\ncomposition and size distribution of the scattering particles in the planet's\natmosphere.\n  To predict the capabilities of MOST and other planned space missions, we have\nconstructed a series of models of such light curves, improving upon earlier\nwork by incorporating more realistic details such as: limb darkening of the\nstar, intrinsic granulation noise in the star itself, tidal distortion and\nback-heating, higher angular resolution of the light scattering from the\nplanet, and exploration of the significance of the angular size of the star as\nseen from the planet. We use photometric performance simulations of the MOST\nsatellite, with the light curve models as inputs, for one of the mission's\nprimary targets, $\\tau$ Bo\\\"otis. These simulations demonstrate that, even\nadopting a very conservative signal detection limit of 4.2 $\\mu$mag in\namplitude (not power), we will be able to either detect the $\\tau$ Bo\\\"otis\nplanet light curve or put severe constraints on possible extrasolar planet\natmospheric models. \n\n"}

However,\nour re-analysis of the Michelson-Morley original data, consistently with the\npoint of view already expressed by other authors, shows that the experimental\nobservations have been misinterpreted. Namely, the fringe shifts point to a\nnon-zero observable Earth's velocity v_obs = 8.4 +/- 0.5 km/s. Assuming the\nexistence of a preferred reference frame, and using Lorentz transformations to\nextract the kinematical Earth's velocity that corresponds to this v_obs, we\nobtain a real velocity, in the plane of the interferometer, v_earth = 201 +/-\n12 km/s. This value is in excellent agreement with Miller's calculated value\nv_earth = 203 +/- 8 km/s and suggests that the magnitude of the fringe shifts\nis determined by the typical velocity of the Solar System within our galaxy.\nThis conclusion, which is also consistent with the results of all other\nclassical experiments, leads to an alternative interpretation of the\nMichelson-Morley type of experiments. Contrary to the generally accepted ideas\nof last century, they provide experimental evidence for the existence of a\npreferred reference frame. This point of view is also consistent with the most\nrecent data for the anisotropy of the two-way speed of light in the vacuum. \n\n"}

Mass, Structure and Thermodynamics of Cluster Cores at z=0.2 Abstract: We present a comprehensive space-based study of ten X-ray luminous galaxy\nclusters (L_X>=8e44erg/s[0.1-2.4keV]) at z=0.2. Hubble Space Telescope\nobservations reveal numerous gravitationally-lensed arcs for which we present\nfour new spectroscopic redshifts, bringing the total to thirteen confirmed arcs\nin this cluster sample. We combine the multiple-image systems with the\nweakly-sheared background galaxies to model the total mass distribution in the\ncluster cores (R<=500kpc). These models are complemented by high-resolution\nX-ray data from Chandra and used to develop quantitative criteria to classify\nthe clusters as relaxed or unrelaxed. Formally, (30+/-20)% of the clusters form\na homogeneous sub-sample of relaxed clusters; the remaining (70+/-20)% are\nunrelaxed and are a much more diverse population. Most of the clusters\ntherefore appear to be experiencing a cluster-cluster merger, or relaxing after\nsuch an event. We also study the normalization and scatter of scaling relations\nbetween cluster mass, luminosity and temperature. The scatter in these\nrelations is dominated by the unrelaxed clusters and is typically sigma~0.4.\nMost notably, we detect 2-3 times more scatter in the mass-temperature relation\nthan theoretical simulations and models predict. The observed scatter is also\nasymmetric - the unrelaxed systems are systematically 40% hotter than the\nrelaxed clusters at 2.5 sigma significance. This structural segregation should\nbe a major concern for experiments designed to constrain cosmological\nparameters using galaxy clusters. Overall our results are consistent with a\nscenario of cluster-cluster merger induced boosts to cluster X-ray luminosities\nand temperatures. [Abridged] \n\n"}

We find stars with velocities consistent with\nmembership of Leo I out to 1.3 King tidal radii. By measuring accurate radial\nvelocities with a median measurement error of 4.6 km/s we find a mean systemic\nvelocity of 284.2 km/s with a global velocity dispersion of 9.9 km/s. The\ndispersion profile is consistent with being flat out to the last data point. We\nshow that a marginally-significant rise in the radial dispersion profile at a\nradius of 3' is not associated with any real localized kinematical\nsubstructure. Given its large distance from the Galaxy, tides are not likely to\nhave affected the velocity dispersion, a statement we support from a\nquantitative kinematical analysis, as we observationally reject the occurrence\nof a significant apparent rotational signal or an asymmetric velocity\ndistribution. Mass determinations adopting both isotropic stellar velocity\ndispersions and more general models yield a M/L ratio of 24, which is\nconsistent with the presence of a significant dark halo with a mass of about\n3x10^7 M_sun, in which the luminous component is embedded. This suggests that\nLeo I exhibits dark matter properties similar to those of other dSphs in the\nLocal Group. Our data allowed us also to determine metallicities for 58 of the\ntargets.

Recent observations of Li show that its intrinsic dispersion in\nmetal-poor stars is essentially zero, and the random error in the mean Li\nabundance is negligible. However, a decreasing trend in the Li abundance\ntowards lower metallicity, plus Li6 detections, indicate that its primordial\nabundance can be inferred only after allowing for nucleosynthesis processes in\nthe Galaxy (Galactic chemical evolution (GCE)). We show that the Li vs Fe trend\nprovides a tough discriminant between alternative models for GCE of\nlight-elements.

We show\nthat the Li constraint on $\\Omega_b$ is now limited principally by\nuncertainties in the nuclear cross-sections used in BBN {\\it calculations}, not\nby the abundance itself.

An alternative is proposed here\nin which the radiation energy density smoothly decreases all during an\ninflation-like stage and with no discontinuity enters the subsequent radiation\ndominated stage. The scale factor is calculated from standard Friedmann\ncosmology in the presence of both radiation and vacuum energy density. A large\nclass of solutions confirm the above identified regime of non-reheating\ninflation-like behavior for observationally consistent expansion factors and\nnot too large a drop in the radiation energy density. One dynamical realization\nof such inflation without reheating is from warm inflation type scenarios.\nHowever the solutions found here are properties of the Einstein equations with\ngenerality beyond slow-roll inflation scenarios. The solutions also can be\ncontinuously interpolated from the non-reheating type behavior to the standard\nsupercooled limit of exponential expansion, thus giving all intermediate\ninflation-like behavior between these two extremes. The temperature of the\nuniverse and the expansion factor are calculated for various cases.\nImplications for baryongenesis are discussed.
