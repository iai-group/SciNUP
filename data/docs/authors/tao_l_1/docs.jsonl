This allows sufficient separation of scales to\nobserve a Navier-Stokes (NS) inertial range followed by a 2nd LANS inertial\nrange. The analysis of the third-order structure function scaling supports the\npredicted l^3 scaling; it corresponds to a k^(-1) scaling of the energy\nspectrum. The energy spectrum itself shows a different scaling which goes as\nk^1. This latter spectrum is consistent with the absence of stretching in the\nsub-filter scales due to the Taylor frozen-in hypothesis employed as a closure\nin the derivation of LANS. These two scalings are conjectured to coexist in\ndifferent spatial portions of the flow. The l^3 (E(k) k^(-1)) scaling is\nsubdominant to k^1 in the energy spectrum, but the l^3 scaling is responsible\nfor the direct energy cascade, as no cascade can result from motions with no\ninternal degrees of freedom. We verify the prediction for the size of the LANS\nattractor resulting from this scaling. From this, we give a methodology either\nfor arriving at grid-independent solutions for LANS, or for obtaining a\nformulation of a LES optimal in the context of the alpha models. The fully\nconverged grid-independent LANS may not be the best approximation to a direct\nnumerical simulation of the NS equations since the minimum error is a balance\nbetween truncation errors and the approximation error due to using LANS instead\nof the primitive equations. Furthermore, the small-scale behavior of LANS\ncontributes to a reduction of flux at constant energy, leading to a shallower\nenergy spectrum for large alpha. These small-scale features, do not preclude\nLANS to reproduce correctly the intermittency properties of high Re flow. \n\n"}

According to Kraichnan's 1962 prediction, the\nflow boundary layers above the cold and hot plates -in which most of the fluid\ntemperature drop is localized- become unstable for large enough $Ra$ and this\ninstability boosts the heat transport compared to the other turbulent regimes.\nUsing the same convection cell as in the 1997 experiment, we show that the\nreported heat transport increase is accompanied with enhanced temperature\nfluctuations of the bottom plate, which was heated at constant power levels.\nIndeed, for $Ra < 10^{12}$, the bottom plate fluctuations can simply be\naccounted from those in the bulk of the flow. In particular, they share the\nsame spectral density at low frequencies, as if the bottom plate was following\nthe slow temperature fluctuations of the bulk, modulo a constant temperature\ndrop across the bottom boundary layer. Conversely, to account for the plate's\ntemperature fluctuations at higher $Ra$, we no-longuer can ignore the\nfluctuations of the temperature drop across the boundary layer.

We also note the association of\nthe radio flaring with periods of X-ray flaring during this transition in most,\nbut not all, of the systems. In the soft state, radio emission is in nearly all\ncases either undetectable or optically thin, consistent with the suppression of\nthe core jet in these states and `relic' radio emission from interactions of\npreviously ejected material and the ambient medium.

The gamma-ray flux is variable, with strong, distinct,\nsymmetrically-shaped flares for which the flux increases by a factor of several\non a time scale of about three days. This variability indicates a compact\nemission region, and the requirement that the source is optically thin to\npair-production implies relativistic beaming with Doppler factor delta > 8,\nconsistent with the values inferred from VLBI observations of superluminal\nexpansion (delta ~ 25).

The hardness-intensity diagram of all RXTE/PCA data\ncombined shows a q-shaped track similar to that observed in previous outbursts.\nThe evolution through the HID suggests that in the early phase of the outburst\nthe source underwent a sequence of state transitions, from the hard to the soft\nstate, which is supported by our timing analysis. Broadband (4-200 keV)\nspectra, fitted with an exponentially cutoff powerlaw, show that the hard\nspectral component steepens during the transition from the hard to the soft\nstate. The high-energy cutoff decreased monotonically from 120 to 60 keV during\nthe brightening of the hard state, but increased again to 100 keV during the\nsoftening in the hard intermediate state.

The central constant-entropy\ntemperature peak recently observed in the innermost 150 parsecs is explained by\ncompressive heating as gas flows toward the central massive black hole. Since\nthe cooling time of this gas is only a few million years, NGC 4649 provides the\nmost acutely concentrated known example of the cooling flow problem in which\nthe time-integrated apparent mass that has flowed into the galactic core\nexceeds the total mass observed there.

The faint point-like gamma-ray source has a >100 MeV flux of 2.45\n(+/- 0.63) x 10^-8 ph cm^-2 s^-1 (photon index = 2.26 +/- 0.13) with no\nsignificant variability detected within the LAT observation. This flux is\ncomparable with the previous EGRET upper limit (< 2.18 x 10^-8 ph cm^-2 s^-1, 2\nsigma), thus there is no evidence for a significant MeV/GeV flare on decade\ntimescales.

The\nevolution of the central accretion rate exhibits phases reminiscent of the long\nGRB gamma-ray and X-ray light curve, which lends support to the proposal that\nthe luminosity is modulated by the central accretion rate. After a few tens of\nseconds, an accretion shock sweeps outward through the star. The formation and\noutward expansion of the accretion shock is accompanied with a sudden and rapid\npower-law decline in the central accretion rate Mdot ~ t^{-2.8}, which\nresembles the L_X ~ t^{-3} decline observed in the X-ray light curves. The\ncollapsed, shock-heated stellar envelope settles into a thick, low-mass\nequatorial disk embedded within a massive, pressure-supported atmosphere. After\na few hundred seconds, the inflow of low-angular-momentum material in the axial\nfunnel reverses into an outflow from the surface of the thick disk. Meanwhile,\nthe rapid decline of the accretion rate slows down, or even settles a in steady\nstate with Mdot ~ 5x10^{-5} Msun/s, which resembles the \"plateau\" phase in the\nX-ray light curve. While the duration of the \"prompt\" phase depends on the\nresolution in our simulations, we provide an analytical model taking into\naccount neutrino losses that estimates the duration to be ~20 s. The model\nsuggests that the steep decline in GRB X-ray light curves is triggered by the\ncircularization of the infalling stellar envelope at radii where the virial\ntemperature is below ~10^{10} K, such that neutrino cooling shuts off and an\noutward expansion of the accretion shock becomes imminent. \n\n"}

The\npresence of extragalactic magnetic fields could also induce conversions between\nvery high-energy photons and hypothetical axion-like particles (ALPs).

Swift/XRT and XMM-Newton/EPIC observations carried\nout in the following two weeks led to the discovery of three X-ray rings\ncentered on this source. The ring radii increased with time following the\nexpansion law expected for a short impulse of X-rays scattered by three dust\nclouds. Assuming different models for the dust composition and grain size\ndistribution, we fit the intensity decay of each ring as a function of time at\ndifferent energies, obtaining tight constrains on the distance of the X-ray\nsource.

SN 2008iy showed an unprecedentedly long rise time of\n~400 days, making it the first SN to take significantly longer than 100 days to\nreach peak optical luminosity. The peak absolute magnitude of SN 2008iy was M_r\n~ -19.1 mag, and the total radiated energy over the first ~700 days was ~2 x\n10^50 erg. Spectroscopically, SN 2008iy is very similar to the Type IIn SN\n1988Z at late times, and, like SN 1988Z, it is a luminous X-ray source (both\nsupernovae had an X-ray luminosity L_ X > 10^41 erg/s). The Halpha emission\nprofile of SN 2008iy shows a narrow P Cygni absorption component, implying a\npre-SN wind speed of ~100 km/s. We argue that the luminosity of SN 2008iy is\npowered via the interaction of the SN ejecta with a dense, clumpy circumstellar\nmedium. The ~400 day rise time can be understood if the number density of\nclumps increases with distance over a radius ~1.7 x 10^16 cm from the\nprogenitor. This scenario is possible if the progenitor experienced an episodic\nphase of enhanced mass-loss < 1 century prior to explosion or the progenitor\nwind speed increased during the decades before core collapse. We favour the\nformer scenario, which is reminiscent of the eruptive mass-loss episodes\nobserved for luminous blue variable (LBV) stars. The progenitor wind speed and\nincreased mass-loss rates serve as further evidence that at least some, and\nperhaps all, Type IIn supernovae experience LBV-like eruptions shortly before\ncore collapse.

Many proposals have been put forth to\nexplain these data, usually relying on a single particle to annihilate or decay\nto produce e+e-. In this paper, we consider models with multiple species of\nWIMPs with significantly different masses. We show if such dark matter\ncandidates chi_i annihilate into light bosons, they naturally produce equal\nannihilation rates, even as the available numbers of pairs for annihilation\nn_chi_i^2 differ by orders of magnitude. We argue that a consequence of these\nmodels can be to add additional signal naturally at lower (~100 GeV) versus\nhigher (~ TeV) energies, changing the expected spectrum and even adding bumps\nat lower energies, which may alleviate some of the tension in the required\nannihilation rates between PAMELA and Fermi.

We investigate the effects of strong fields on the disks around\nmagnetars, and discuss implications of such accreting magnetar systems for GRB\nand GRB-like events. We discuss quantum effects of the strong fields on the\ndisk, and use the MHD conservation equations to describe the behavior of the\ndisk flow coupled with a large scale field, which is generated by the star-disk\ninteraction. In general, stronger fields give higher disk densities, pressures,\ntemperatures and neutrino luminosity, and change the electron fraction and\ndegeneracy state significantly. A magnetized disk is always viscously stable\noutside the Alfv\\'{e}n radius, but will be thermally unstable near the\nAlfv\\'{e}n radius where the magnetic field plays a more important role in\ntransferring the angular momentum and heating the disk than the viscous stress.\nThe funnel accretion process will be only important for an extremely strong\nfield, which creates a magnetosphere inside the Alfv\\'{e}n radius and truncates\nthe plane disk.

GRB 090510, a short burst, is\nparticularly interesting because the good timing allows to derive a severe\nlimit to theories of quantum gravity. With the dozen bursts detected in the\n0.1-30 GeV band so far, we start to see some common properties: (i) the\nduration is often longer than the duration of the softer emission detected by\nthe Gamma Burst Monitor (GBM) onboard Fermi; (ii) the spectrum is consistent\nwith F(v)~v^{-1} with no strong spectral evolution; (iii) for the brightest\nbursts, the flux detected by the LAT decays as a power law with a typical\nslope: t^{-1.5}; iv) the peak energy of the GBM emission exceeds 500 keV (rest\nframe). These properties suggest a similar process for the origin of the GeV\nflux. We propose that it is afterglow synchrotron emission shortly following\nthe start of the prompt phase. The steep decay slope suggests that the fireball\nemits in the radiative regime, i.e. all dissipated energy is radiated away. The\nlarge peak energy of the GBM flux suggests that electron-positron pairs might\nplay a crucial role. The rapid onset, but with some delay, of the GeV flux with\nrespect to the GBM one suggests that the bulk Lorentz factor Gamma of these\nbursts is of the order of 1000. Therefore the relatively small fraction of\nbursts detected at high energies might correspond to the fraction of bursts\nhaving the largest Gamma. If the emission occurs in the radiative regime we can\nstart to understand why the observed X-ray and optical afterglow energetics are\nmuch smaller than the energetics emitted during the prompt phase. \n\n"}

This may reveal the geometry of the explosion and its\nconnection to the equatorial ring and the outer rings around SN 1987A. We have\nused integral field spectroscopy to image the supernova ejecta and the\nequatorial ring in the emission lines of [Si I]+[Fe II] and He I. The spectral\ninformation can be mapped into a radial velocity image revealing the expansion\nof the ejecta both as projected onto the sky and perpendicular to the sky\nplane. The inner ejecta are spatially resolved in a North-South direction and\nare clearly asymmetric. We argue that the bulk of the ejecta is situated in the\nsame plane as defined by the equatorial ring and does not form a bipolar\nstructure as has been suggested. The exact shape of the ejecta is modelled and\nwe find that an elongated triaxial ellipsoid fits the observations best. From\nour spectral analyses of the ejecta spectrum we find that most of the He I, [Si\nI] and [Fe I-II] emission originates in the core material which has undergone\nexplosive nucleosynthesis. The He I emission may be the result of alpha-rich\nfreeze-out if the positron energy is deposited locally. Our observations\nclearly indicate a non-symmetric explosion mechanism for SN 1987A.

Near the accretion shock, the density\nof the intracluster medium is very low and the Coulomb collisional timescale is\nlonger than the accretion timescale. Electrons and ions may not achieve\nequipartition in these regions. Numerical simulations have shown that the\nSunyaev-Zel'dovich observables (e.g., the integrated Comptonization parameter\nY) for relaxed clusters can be biased by a few percent. The Y-mass relation can\nbe biased if non-equipartition effects are not properly taken into account.\nUsing a set of hydrodynamical simulations, we have calculated three potential\nsystematic biases in the Y-mass relations introduced by non-equipartition\neffects during the cross-calibration or self-calibration when using the galaxy\ncluster abundance technique to constraint cosmological parameters. We then use\na semi-analytic technique to estimate the non-equipartition effects on the\ndistribution functions of Y (Y functions) determined from the extended\nPress-Schechter theory. Depending on the calibration method, we find that\nnon-equipartition effects can induce systematic biases on the Y functions, and\nthe values of the cosmological parameters Omega_8, sigma_8, and the dark energy\nequation of state parameter w can be biased by a few percent.

We took spectra of its strongly irradiated companion and found an\nobserved radial-velocity amplitude of K_obs=324+/-3 km/s.

Computation of\n  resonance strengths Abstract: We present a fully relativistic computation of the torques due to Lindblad\nresonances from perturbers on circular, equatorial orbits on discs around\nSchwarzschild and Kerr black holes. The computation proceeds by establishing a\nrelation between the Lindblad torques and the gravitational waveforms emitted\nby the perturber and a test particle in a slightly eccentric orbit at the\nradius of the Lindblad resonance. We show that our result reduces to the usual\nformula when taking the nonrelativistic limit.

Particles begin the acceleration by the ExB\ndrift with the accretion flow. The energy gain in the drift regime is limited\nby the conservation of the adiabatic invariant p_perp^2/B. Upon approaching the\nfilament, the drift turns into the gyro-motion around the filament so that the\nparticle moves parallel to the azimuthal electric field. In this 'betatron'\nregime the acceleration speeds up to rapidly reach the electrodynamic limit\n$cp_{max}=eBR$ for an accelerator with magnetic field $B$ and the orbit radius\n$R$ (Larmor radius). The periodic orbit becomes unstable and the particle\nslings out of the filament to the region of a weak (uncompressed) magnetic\nfield, which terminates the acceleration.\n  The mechanism requires pre-acceleration that is likely to occur in structure\nformation shocks upstream or nearby the filament accretion flow.

They\nare the most luminous objects detected so far within ~ 100 Mpc, the horizon\ndistance of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs), so they are considered to\nbe candidate sources of UHECRs. It was recently argued that the energy\nproduction rate in UHECRs is much larger than that in gamma-ray photons of long\nGRBs measured by the Fermi satellite, which, if true, would challenge the view\nthat GRBs can be the sources of UHECRs. We here suggest that many of the low\nluminosity GRBs, due to their low luminosity, can not trigger the current GRB\ndetectors and hence their contribution to the local gamma-ray energy production\nrate is missing. We find that the real local energy production rate by\nlow-luminosity GRBs, taking into account the missing part, which constitutes a\ndominant fraction of the total amount, could be sufficient to account for the\nflux of UHECRs. Due to the low-luminosity, only intermediate-mass or heavy\nnuclei can be accelerated to ~ 10^20 eV. We discuss the acceleration and\nsurvival of these UHE nuclei in low-luminosity GRBs, especially in those\nmissing low-luminosity GRBs.

Suzaku found the source in a minimum flux level;\na comparison with the XMM-Newton data implies an increase of a factor of 2.5 in\nthe 0.5-10 keV flux, in the 6 months separating the two observations. The iron\nK complex is detected in both datasets, with rather low equivalent width(s).\nThe intensity of the iron K complex does not respond to the change in continuum\nflux. An ultra-fast, high-ionization outflowing gas is clearly detected in the\nXIS data; the absorber is most likely unstable. Indeed, during the XMM-Newton\nobservation, which was 6 months after, the absorber was not detected. No clear\nroll-over in the hard X-ray emission is detected, probably due to the emergence\nof the jet as a dominant component in the hard X-ray band, as suggested by the\ndetection above ~ 100 keV with the GSO on-board Suzaku, although the present\ndata do not allow us to firmly constrain the relative contribution of the\ndifferent components. The fluxes observed by the gamma-ray satellites CGRO and\nFermi would be compatible with the putative jet component if peaking at\nenergies E ~ 100 MeV. In the X-ray band, the jet contribution to the continuum\nstarts to be significant only above 10 keV.

Abstract: The 2008 outburst of the atoll source IGR J17473--2721 was observed by\nINTEGRAL, RXTE and Swift. Tens of type-I X-ray bursts were found in this\noutburst. Joint observations provide sufficient data to look into the behavior\nof IGR J17473--2721 at the rising part of the outburst. We find that the joint\nenergy spectra can be well fitted with a model composed of a blackbody and a\ncutoff power-law, with a cutoff energy decreasing from $ \\sim$ 150 keV to\n$\\sim$ 40 keV as the source leaves the quiescent state toward the low hard\nstate. This fits into a scenario in which the corona is cooled by the soft\nX-rays along the outburst evolution, as observed in several other atoll\nsources. By using the flux measured in the 1.5--30 keV band of the type-I\nbursts during the outburst, we find that the linear relationship between the\nburst duration and the flux still holds for those bursts that occur at the\ndecaying part of the low hard state, but with a different slope than the\noverall one that was estimated with the bursts happening in the whole extent\nof, and for the rest of the low hard state. The significance of such a\ndichotomy in the type-I X-ray bursts is $\\sim$ 3 $\\sigma$ under an F-test.\nSimilar results are hinted at as well with the broader energy-band that was\nadopted recently. This dichotomy may be understood in a scenario where part of\nthe accreting material forms a corona on the way of falling onto the surface of\nthe neutron star during the decaying part of the low hard state. Based on the\naccretion rates of the preceding LHS, estimated from type-I X-ray bursts and\nfrom persistent emission, at least for IGR J17473-2721, most of the accretion\nmaterial may fall on the neutron star (NS) surface in the LHS.

For the first\ntime in this type of source, a clear indication is found for a relation between\nhigh activity at high energies and a long-term increase in the low frequency\nfluxes. \n\n"}

While a strong interaction\nbetween SN ejecta and dense circumstellar media (CSM) is a leading scenario,\nalternative models have been proposed. In this Letter, we suggest new\ndiagnostics to discriminate the strong SN-CSM interaction scenario from the\nothers: a decline in the luminosity ('dip') before the main peak of the light\ncurve. This dip is an unavoidable consequence of having a dense CSM within\nwhich the shock breakout occurs. If a dense CSM shell is located far at large\nradii from the progenitor inside, it takes time for the SN ejecta to reach it\nand the early light curve can be powered by the SN ejecta before the collision.\nOnce the SN ejecta collides with the dense CSM, the electron density and thus\nthe Thomson scattering opacity suddenly increase. Photons become unable to go\nout of the shock even if there is a source of emission inside, which results in\nthe dip in the light curve. This dip is a solid prediction from the strong\ninteraction scenario irrespective of a power source for the early emission.\nEventually the forward shock breaks out from within the dense CSM, and the\nluminosity increases by the continuous strong SN-CSM interaction, resulting in\nan SLSN. The possible dip observed in the hydrogen-poor SLSN, 2006oz, could be\nthe first example of this signature and give support to the SN-CSM interaction\nas the power source of SLSN 2006oz. \n\n"}

Such Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) feedback can account for the\nobserved proportionality between central black hole and host galaxy mass.\nDirect observational evidence for the radiative or quasar mode of feedback,\nwhich occurs when the AGN is very luminous, has been difficult to obtain but is\naccumulating from a few exceptional objects. Feedback from the kinetic or radio\nmode, which uses the mechanical energy of radio-emitting jets often seen when\nthe AGN is operating at a lower level, is common in massive elliptical\ngalaxies. This mode is well observed directly through X-ray observations of the\ncentral galaxies of cool core clusters in the form of bubbles in the hot\nsurrounding medium.

Recent theoretical and experimental studies demonstrate that spike\ncorrelations in recurrent neural networks are considerably smaller than\nexpected based on the amount of shared presynaptic input. By means of a linear\nnetwork model and simulations of networks of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons,\nwe show that shared-input correlations are efficiently suppressed by inhibitory\nfeedback. To elucidate the effect of feedback, we compare the responses of the\nintact recurrent network and systems where the statistics of the feedback\nchannel is perturbed. The suppression of spike-train correlations and\npopulation-rate fluctuations by inhibitory feedback can be observed both in\npurely inhibitory and in excitatory-inhibitory networks.

The widely-accepted theory of the particle acceleration, so-called\ndiffusive shock acceleration (DSA) or Fermi mechanism, requires seed electrons\nwith modest energy with gamma ~ 1 - 100, and little is known about this\npre-acceleration mechanism: We derive the energy distribution of relativistic\nelectrons in this pre-accelerated energy regime. We find that the efficiency of\nthe electron acceleration must be low, i.e., epsilon_e <~ 0.01 as compared to\nthe conventionally assumed value of epsilon_e ~ 0.1. Furthermore, independently\nfrom the low value of epsilon_e, we find that the X-ray luminosity cannot be\nattributed to any emission mechanisms suggested so far as long as these\nelectrons follow the conventionally-assumed single power-law distribution. A\nconsistent view between the radio and X-ray can only be obtained if the\npre-acceleration injection spectrum peaks at gamma ~ 20-30 and then only a\nfraction of these electrons eventually experience the DSA-like acceleration\ntoward the higher energy -- then the radio and X-ray properties are explained\nthrough the synchrotron and inverse Compton mechanisms, respectively.

In this paper,\nwe suggest to add the \"amplitude\" of GRB prompt emission as the third dimension\nas a complementary criterion to classify GRBs, especially those of short\ndurations. We define three new parameters $f$, $f_{\\rm eff}$ and $f_{\\rm\neff,z}$ as ratios between the measured/simulated peak flux of a GRB/pseudo-GRB\nand the flux background, and discuss the applications of these parameters to\nGRB classification.

Most of the scenarios proposed to\nexplain their nature assume that ULXs are powered by accretion on to a black\nhole (BH).

We present the results of a high-resolution (very\nlong baseline interferometry) radio observational campaign aimed at detecting\nand studying compact radio emission in four ULXs with known radio counterparts.\nWe find that one of the targets (N4559-X4) was previously misclassified: its\nlow X-ray luminosity indicates that the source is not a ULX. No\nmilliarcsec-scale radio emission is detected for N4559-X4 nor for the ULXs\nN4490-X1 and N5194-X2, for which upper limits on the radio luminosities are\nestimated.

To determine the collision rate, many\nnumerical studies rely on the 'Ghost Collision Approximation' (GCA), which\nsimply records how often pairs of point particles come within a threshold\ndistance. In many applications, the suspended particles stick (or in the case\nof liquid droplets, coalesce) upon collision, and it is the frequency of first\ncontact which is of interest. If a pair of 'ghost' particles undergoes multiple\ncollisions, the GCA may overestimate the true collision rate. Here, using fully\nresolved Direct Numerical Simulations of turbulent flows at moderate Reynolds\nnumber (R_\\lambda = 130), we investigate the prevalence and properties of\nmultiple collisions. We demonstrate that the GCA leads to a systematic\noverestimate of the collision rate, which is of the order of 15% when the\nparticle inertia is small, and slowly decreases when inertia increases.

We show that diffusive shock\nacceleration operates for quasi-parallel configurations (i.e., when the\nbackground magnetic field is almost aligned with the shock normal) and, for\nlarge sonic and Alfv\\'enic Mach numbers, produces universal power-law spectra\nproportional to p^(-4), where p is the particle momentum. The maximum energy of\naccelerated ions increases with time, and it is only limited by finite box size\nand run time. Acceleration is mainly efficient for parallel and quasi-parallel\nstrong shocks, where 10-20% of the bulk kinetic energy can be converted to\nenergetic particles, and becomes ineffective for quasi-perpendicular shocks.\nAlso, the generation of magnetic turbulence correlates with efficient ion\nacceleration, and vanishes for quasi-perpendicular configurations.

Studies of\nstripped-envelope supernovae, in particular, require binary mass transfer.\nDramatic examples of eruptive mass loss are seen in Type IIn supernovae, which\nhave massive shells ejected just a few years before core collapse.

These quantities can undergo dramatic\nchanges over time if the underlying physical processes change. However, some\nchanges can be subtle and not distinguishable using standard statistical\napproaches. Here, we report a methodology that aims to identify distinct but\nsimilar states of time variability. We apply this method to the Galactic\nsupermassive black hole, where 2.2 um flux is observed from a source associated\nwith SgrA*, and where two distinct states have recently been suggested. Our\napproach is taken from mathematical finance and works with conditional flux\ndensity distributions that depend on the previous flux value. The discrete,\nunobserved (hidden) state variable is modeled as a stochastic process and the\ntransition probabilities are inferred from the flux density time series. Using\nthe most comprehensive data set to date, in which all Keck and a majority of\nthe publicly available VLT data have been merged, we show that SgrA* is\nsufficiently described by a single intrinsic state. However the observed flux\ndensities exhibit two states: a noise-dominated and a source-dominated one. Our\nmethodology reported here will prove extremely useful to assess the effects of\nthe putative gas cloud G2 that is on its way toward the black hole and might\ncreate a new state of variability. \n\n"}

Abstract: Starting from the Oppenheimer-Snyder model, we know how in classical general\nrelativity the gravitational collapse of matter form a black hole with a\ncentral spacetime singularity. It is widely believed that the singularity must\nbe removed by quantum gravity effects. Some static quantum-inspired\nsingularity-free black hole solutions have been proposed in the literature, but\nwhen one considers simple examples of gravitational collapse the classical\nsingularity is replaced by a bounce, after which the collapsing matter expands\nfor ever. We may expect 3 possible explanations: $i)$ the static regular black\nhole solutions are not physical, in the sense that they cannot be realized in\nNature, $ii)$ the final product of the collapse is not unique, but it depends\non the initial conditions, or $iii)$ boundary effects play an important role\nand our simple models miss important physics. In the latter case, after proper\nadjustment, the bouncing solution would approach the static one. We argue that\nthe \"correct answer\" may be related to the appearance of a ghost state in de\nSitter spacetimes with super Planckian mass. Our black holes have indeed a de\nSitter core and the ghost would make these configurations unstable. Therefore\nwe believe that these black hole static solutions represent the transient phase\nof a gravitational collapse, but never survive as asymptotic states. \n\n"}

Abstract: Giant planets like Jupiter and Saturn feature strong zonal wind patterns on\ntheir surfaces. Although several different mechanisms that may drive these jets\nhave been proposed over the last decades, the origin of the zonal winds is\nstill unclear. Here, we explore the possibility that the interplay of planetary\nrotation with the compression and expansion of the convecting fluid can drive\nmultiple deep zonal jets by a compressional Rhines-type mechanism, as\noriginally proposed by Ingersoll and Pollard (1982). In a certain limit, this\ndeep mechanism is shown to be mathematically analogous to the classical Rhines\nmechanism possibly operating at cloud level. Jets are predicted to occur on a\ncompressional Rhines length $l_R = (2 \\Omega \\langle H_\\rho^{-1} \\rangle\nv_{jet}^{-1} )^{-1/2}$, where $\\Omega$ is the angular velocity, $\\langle\nH_\\rho^{-1} \\rangle$ is the mean inverse density scale height and $v_{jet}$ is\nthe typical jet velocity. Two-dimensional numerical simulations using the\nanelastic approximation reveal that this mechanism robustly generates jets of\nthe predicted width, and that it typically dominates the dynamics in systems\ndeeper than $O(l_R)$. Potential vorticity staircases are observed to form\nspontaneously and are typically accompanied by unstably stratified buoyancy\nstaircases. The mechanism only operates at large rotation rates, exceeding\nthose typically reached in three-dimensional simulations of deep convection in\nspherical shells. Applied to Jupiter and Saturn, the compressional Rhines\nscaling reasonably fits the available observations. Interestingly, even weak\nvertical density variations such as those in the Earth core can give rise to a\nlarge number of jets, leading to fundamentally different flow structures than\npredicted by the Boussinesq models typically used in this context. \n\n"}

The whole radio beam may consist of\nseveral sub-beams, forming a fan-shaped pattern. When only one or a few flux\ntubes are active, the fan beam becomes very patchy. This model differs\nessentially from the conal beam models in the respects of beam structure and\npredictions on the relationship between pulse width and impact angle $\\beta$\n(the angle between line of sight and magnetic pole) and the relationship\nbetween emission intensity and beam angular radius. The evidence for this model\ncomes from the observed patchy beams of precessional binary pulsars and three\nstatistical relationships found for a sample of 64 pulsars, of which $\\beta$\nwere mostly constrained by fitting polarization position angle data with the\nRotation Vector Model.

The\nclassic unheated and unperturbed cooling flow model predicts dramatic cooling\nrates and an isobaric X-ray spectrum with constant differential luminosity\ndistribution. The observed cores of clusters (and groups) show instead a strong\ndeficit of soft X-ray emission: $dL_{\\rm x}/dT \\propto (T/T_{\\rm\nhot})^{\\alpha=2\\pm1}$. Using 3D hydrodynamic simulations, we show that such\ndeficit arises from the tight self-regulation between thermal instability\ncondensation and AGN outflow injection: condensing clouds boost the AGN\noutflows, which quench cooling as they thermalize through the core. The\nresultant average distribution slope is $\\alpha \\simeq 2$, oscillating within\nthe observed $1<\\alpha<3$. In the absence of thermal instability, the X-ray\nspectrum remains isothermal ($\\alpha > 8$), while unopposed cooling drives a\ntoo shallow slope, $\\alpha<1$. AGN outflows deposit their energy inside-out,\nreleasing more heat in the inner cooler phase; radially distributed heating\nalone induces a declining spectrum, $1<\\alpha<2$. Turbulence further steepens\nthe spectrum and increases the scatter: the turbulent Mach number in the hot\nphase is subsonic, while it becomes transonic in the cooler phase, making\nperturbations to depart from the isobaric mode. Such increase in $d\\ln P/d\\ln\nT$ leads to $\\alpha\\approx3$. Self-regulated AGN outflow feedback can address\nthe soft X-ray problem through the interplay of heating and turbulence. \n\n"}

However Shannon's theory of information does not provide\nformulae to fully determine these quantities. Several recent studies have begun\naddressing this. Some possible definitions for PID quantities have been\nproposed, and some analyses have been carried out on systems composed of\ndiscrete variables. Here we present the first in-depth analysis of PIDs on\nGaussian systems, both static and dynamical. We show that, for a broad class of\nGaussian systems, previously proposed PID formulae imply that: (i) redundancy\nreduces to the minimum information provided by either source variable, and\nhence is independent of correlation between sources; (ii) synergy is the extra\ninformation contributed by the weaker source when the stronger source is known,\nand can either increase or decrease with correlation between sources.

However, the coarse\nlocalizations of tens to a hundred square degrees provided by the Fermi GRB\nMonitor instrument have posed a formidable obstacle to locating the bursts'\nhost galaxies, measuring their redshifts, and tracking their panchromatic\nafterglows.

Two of the bursts with detected\nafterglows (GRBs 130702A and 140606B) were at low redshift (z=0.145 and 0.384\nrespectively) and had spectroscopically confirmed broad-line Type Ic\nsupernovae.

Recent 3D simulations suggest that\nturbulence might play a crucial role in core-collapse supernova explosions,\nhowever the fidelity with which turbulence is simulated in these studies is\nunclear. Especially considering that the accuracy of ILES for the regime of\ninterest in CCSN, weakly compressible and strongly anisotropic, has not been\nsystematically assessed before. In this paper we assess the accuracy of ILES\nusing numerical methods most commonly employed in computational astrophysics by\nmeans of a number of local simulations of driven, weakly compressible,\nanisotropic turbulence. We report a detailed analysis of the way in which the\nturbulent cascade is influenced by the numerics. Our results suggest that\nanisotropy and compressibility in CCSN turbulence have little effect on the\nturbulent kinetic energy spectrum and a Kolmogorov $k^{-5/3}$ scaling is\nobtained in the inertial range. We find that, on the one hand, the kinetic\nenergy dissipation rate at large scales is correctly captured even at\nrelatively low resolutions, suggesting that very high effective Reynolds number\ncan be achieved at the largest scales of the simulation. On the other hand, the\ndynamics at intermediate scales appears to be completely dominated by the\nso-called bottleneck effect, \\ie the pile up of kinetic energy close to the\ndissipation range due to the partial suppression of the energy cascade by\nnumerical viscosity.

Abstract: The accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar SAX J1808.4--3658 shows peculiar low\nluminosity states known as \"reflares\" after the end of the main outburst.\nDuring this phase the X-ray luminosity of the source varies by up to three\norders of magnitude in less than 1-2 days. The lowest X-ray luminosity observed\nreaches a value of ~1e32 erg/s, only a factor of a few brighter than its\ntypical quiescent level. We investigate the 2008 and 2005 reflaring state of\nSAX J1808.4-3658 to determine whether there is any evidence for a change in the\naccretion flow with respect to the main outburst. We perform a multiwavelength\nphotometric and spectral study of the 2005 and 2008 reflares with data\ncollected during an observational campaign covering the near-infrared, optical,\nultra-violet and X-ray band. We find that the NIR/optical/UV emission, expected\nto some from the outer accretion disk shows variations in luminosity which are\n1--2 orders of magnitude shallower than in X-rays. The X-ray spectral state\nobserved during the reflares does not change substantially with X-ray\nluminosity indicating a rather stable configuration of the accretion flow.

Recently,\nlaboratory experiments of Taylor--Couette flow with externally imposed axial\nand azimuthal magnetic fields have revealed the kinematic and dynamic\nproperties of the MRI close to the instability onset.

These effects relate to\nthe enhancement or depletion, respectively, in coronal abundance with respect\nto photospheric values of elements with FIP below about 10~eV. They are\ninterpreted in terms of the ponderomotive force due to the propagation and/or\nreflection of magnetohydrodynamic waves in the chromosphere. This acts on\nchromospheric ions, but not neutrals, and so can lead to ion-neutral\nfractionation.\n  A detailed description of the model applied to closed magnetic loops, and to\nopen field regions is given, accounting for the observed difference in solar\nFIP fractionation between the slow and fast wind. It is shown that such a model\ncan also account for the observed depletion of helium in the solar wind. The\nhelium depletion is sensitive to the chromospheric altitude where ion-neutral\nseparation occurs, and the behavior of the helium abundance in the closed\nmagnetic loop strongly suggests that the waves have a coronal origin. This, and\nother similar inferences may be expected to have a strong bearing on theories\nof solar coronal heating.\n  Chromospheric waves originating from below as acoustic waves mode convert,\nmainly to fast mode waves, can also give rise to ion-neutral separation.\nDepending on the geometry of the magnetic field, this can result in FIP or\nInverse FIP effects. We argue that such configurations are more likely to occur\nin later-type stars (known to have stronger field in any case), and that this\nexplains the occurrence of the Inverse FIP effect in M dwarfs. \n\n"}

We show that a Quark-Nova (QN; explosive transition\nof the neutron star to a quark star) occurring in a massive binary,\nexperiencing two Common Envelope (CE) phases, can quantitatively explain the\nlight curves of LSQ14bdq and SN 2006oz. The more massive component (A) explodes\nfirst as a normal SN, yielding a Neutron Star which ejects the hydrogen\nenvelope of the companion when the system enters its first CE phase. During the\nsecond CE phase, the NS spirals into and inflates the second He-rich CE. In the\nprocess it gains mass and triggers a Quark-Nova, outside of the CO core,\nleaving behind a Quark Star. The first hump in our model is the QN shock\nre-energizing the expanded He-rich CE. The QN occurs when the He-rich envelope\nis near maximum size (~ 1000R_sun) and imparts enough energy to unbind and\neject the envelope.

We track the\nevolution of these spectra as the source makes a transition from a bright\nlow/hard to hard intermediate state. In the hard/intermediate states, the QPO\nand time averaged spectra are similar and the harmonic is either undetected or\nsimilar to the QPO. By contrast, in the softer states the harmonic is\ndramatically softer than the QPO spectrum and the time averaged spectrum, and\nthe QPO spectrum is dramatically harder than the time averaged spectrum.\nClearly, the existance of these very different spectral shaped components mean\nthat the time-averaged spectra are complex. We use the frequency resolved\nspectra to better constrain the model components, and find that the data are\nconsistent with a time-averaged spectrum which has an additional low\ntemperature, optically thick Comptonisation component. The harmonic can be\ndescribed by this additional component alone, while the QPO spectrum is similar\nto that of the hard Comptonisation and its reflection. Neither QPO nor harmonic\nshow signs of the disc component even when it is strong in the time averaged\nspectrum.

In this manuscript, we assume that the shock revival is\ninitiated by the delayed-neutrino mechanism and derive an integral condition\nfor spherically symmetric shock expansion, $v_s > 0$.

In these\ngraphs, the vertices correspond to the small areas of the gray matter, and two\nvertices are connected by an edge, if a diffusion-MRI based workflow finds\nconnections between those areas. One main question of the field is discovering\nthe directions of the edges. In a previous work we have reported the\nconstruction of the Budapest Reference Connectome Server\nhttp://connectome.pitgroup.org from the data recorded in the Human Connectome\nProject of the NIH. After the server had been published, we recognized a\nsurprising and unforeseen property of it: The server can generate the\nbraingraph of connections that are present in at least $k$ graphs out of the\n418, for any value of $k=1,2,...,418$. When the value of $k$ is changed from\n$k=418$ through 1 by moving a slider at the webserver from right to left, more\nand more edges appear in the consensus graph. The astonishing observation is\nthat the appearance of the new edges is not random: it is similar to a growing\ntree. We hypothesize that this movement of the slider in the webserver may copy\nthe development of the connections in the human brain in the following sense:\nthe connections that are present in all subjects are the oldest ones, and those\nthat are present in a decreasing fraction of subjects are gradually the newer\nconnections in the individual brain development. An animation on the phenomenon\nis available at https://youtu.be/EnWwIf_HNjw. Based on this hypothesis, we can\nassign directions to the edges of the connectome as follows: Let $G_i$ denote\nthe consensus connectome where each edge is present in at least $i$ graphs.\nSuppose that vertex $v$ is isolated in $G_{k+1}$, and becomes connected to a\nvertex $u$ in $G_k$, where $u$ was connected to other vertices already in\n$G_{k+1}$.

Constrained transport (CT) schemes can\nachieve this at high accuracy, but have generally been restricted to very\nspecific methods. For more general (meshless, moving-mesh, or ALE) methods,\n'divergence-cleaning' schemes reduce the div-B errors, however they can still\nbe significant, especially at discontinuities, and can lead to systematic\ndeviations from correct solutions which converge away very slowly. Here we\npropose a new constrained gradient (CG) scheme which augments these with a\nhybrid projection step, and can be applied to any numerical scheme with a\nreconstruction. This iteratively approximates the least-squares minimizing,\nglobally divergence-free reconstruction of the fluid. We emphasize that, unlike\n'locally divergence free' methods, this actually minimizes the numerically\nunstable div-B terms, without affecting the convergence order of the method. We\nimplement this in the mesh-free code GIZMO and compare a wide range of test\nproblems. Compared to state-of-the-art cleaning schemes, our CG method reduces\nthe maximum div-B errors in each problem by 1-3 orders of magnitude (2-5 dex\nbelow the typical errors if no div-B cleaning is used). By preventing large\ndiv-B even at unresolved discontinuities, the method eliminates systematic\nerrors at jumps. In every problem, the accuracy of our CG results is comparable\nto CT methods. The cost is modest, ~30% of the hydro algorithm, and the CG\ncorrection can be easily implemented in a wide range of different numerical MHD\nmethods. While for many problems, we find Dedner-type cleaning schemes are\nsufficient for good results, we identify a wide range of problems where using\nonly the simplest Powell or '8-wave' cleaning can produce systematic,\norder-of-magnitude errors. \n\n"}

The pulsar is thought to switch between an \"off\" state in which no\nemission is detectable, a weak state and a strong state. We ran three\nindependent transient detection pipelines on two-minute snapshot images from a\n13 hour BETA observation in order to 1) study the emission from the pulsar, 2)\nsearch for other transient emission from elsewhere in the image and 3) to\ncompare the results from the different transient detection pipelines. The\npulsar was easily detected as a transient source and, over the course of the\nobservations, it switched into the strong state three times giving a typical\ntimescale between the strong emission states of 3.7 hours. After the first\nswitch it remained in the strong state for almost 40 minutes. The other strong\nstates lasted less than 4 minutes. The second state change was confirmed using\nobservations with the Parkes radio telescope. No other transient events were\nfound and we place constraints on the surface density of such events on these\ntimescales. The high sensitivity Parkes observations enabled us to detect\nindividual bright pulses during the weak state and to study the strong state\nover a wide observing band.

In contrast to\nother recent parametric approaches, our model predicts the properties of\nneutrino-driven explosions based on the pre-collapse stellar structure without\nthe need for hydrodynamic simulations. The model is based on physically\nmotivated scaling laws and simple differential equations describing the shock\npropagation, the contraction of the neutron star, the neutrino emission, the\nheating conditions, and the explosion energetics. Using model parameters\ncompatible with multi-D simulations and a fine grid of thousands of supernova\nprogenitors, we obtain a variegated landscape of neutron star and black hole\nformation similar to other parameterised approaches and find good agreement\nwith semi-empirical measures for the \"explodability\" of massive stars. Our\npredicted explosion properties largely conform to observed correlations between\nthe nickel mass and explosion energy. Accounting for the coexistence of\noutflows and downflows during the explosion phase, we naturally obtain a\npositive correlation between explosion energy and ejecta mass. These\ncorrelations are relatively robust against parameter variations, but our\nresults suggest that there is considerable leeway in parametric models to widen\nor narrow the mass ranges for black hole and neutron star formation and to\nscale explosion energies up or down.

Sparse representation also has a good reputation in both\ntheoretical research and practical applications. Many different algorithms have\nbeen proposed for sparse representation. The main purpose of this article is to\nprovide a comprehensive study and an updated review on sparse representation\nand to supply a guidance for researchers. The taxonomy of sparse representation\nmethods can be studied from various viewpoints. For example, in terms of\ndifferent norm minimizations used in sparsity constraints, the methods can be\nroughly categorized into five groups: sparse representation with $l_0$-norm\nminimization, sparse representation with $l_p$-norm (0$<$p$<$1) minimization,\nsparse representation with $l_1$-norm minimization and sparse representation\nwith $l_{2,1}$-norm minimization. In this paper, a comprehensive overview of\nsparse representation is provided. The available sparse representation\nalgorithms can also be empirically categorized into four groups: greedy\nstrategy approximation, constrained optimization, proximity algorithm-based\noptimization, and homotopy algorithm-based sparse representation. The\nrationales of different algorithms in each category are analyzed and a wide\nrange of sparse representation applications are summarized, which could\nsufficiently reveal the potential nature of the sparse representation theory.\nSpecifically, an experimentally comparative study of these sparse\nrepresentation algorithms was presented.

However,\ntheir origin is still highly debated. In one of the leading formation\nscenarios, a black hole of $\\sim100$ M$_{\\odot}$ results from the collapse of\nthe inner core of a supermassive star ($\\gtrsim 10^{4-5}$ M$_{\\odot}$), created\nby the rapid accumulation ($\\gtrsim 0.1 $ M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) of pristine\ngas at the centre of newly formed galaxies at $z\\sim 15$. The subsequent\nevolution is still speculative: the remaining gas in the supermassive star can\neither directly plunge into the nascent black hole, or part of it can form a\ncentral accretion disc, whose luminosity sustains a surrounding, massive, and\nnearly hydrostatic envelope (a system called a \"quasi-star\"). To address this\npoint, we consider the effect of rotation on a quasi-star, as angular momentum\nis inevitably transported towards the galactic nucleus by the accumulating gas.\nUsing a model for the internal redistribution of angular momentum that\nqualitative matches results from simulations of rotating convective stellar\nenvelopes, we show that quasi-stars with an envelope mass greater than a few\n$10^{5}$ M$_{\\odot} \\times (\\rm black~hole~mass/100 M_{\\odot})^{0.82}$ have\nhighly sub-keplerian gas motion in their core, preventing gas circularisation\noutside the black hole's horizon. Less massive quasi-stars could form but last\nfor only $\\lesssim 10^4$ years before the accretion luminosity unbinds the\nenvelope, suppressing the black hole growth. We speculate that this might\neventually lead to a dual black hole seed population: (i) massive ($>10^{4}$\nM$_{\\odot}$) seeds formed in the most massive ($> 10^{8}$ M$_{\\odot}$) and rare\nhaloes; (ii) lighter ($\\sim 10^{2}$ M$_{\\odot}$) seeds to be found in less\nmassive and therefore more common haloes. \n\n"}

Recently, data-driven methods have been proposed as a promising\nalternative to the traditional approaches of turbulence model development. In\nthis work we propose a data-driven, physics-informed machine learning approach\nfor predicting discrepancies in RANS modeled Reynolds stresses. The\ndiscrepancies are formulated as functions of the mean flow features. By using a\nmodern machine learning technique based on random forests, the discrepancy\nfunctions are first trained with benchmark flow data and then used to predict\nReynolds stresses discrepancies in new flows. The method is used to predict the\nReynolds stresses in the flow over periodic hills by using two training flow\nscenarios of increasing difficulties: (1) the flow in the same periodic hills\ngeometry yet at a lower Reynolds number, and (2) the flow in a different hill\ngeometry with a similar recirculation zone. Excellent predictive performances\nwere observed in both scenarios, demonstrating the merits of the proposed\nmethod. Improvement of RANS modeled Reynolds stresses enabled by the proposed\nmethod is an important step towards predictive turbulence modeling, where the\nultimate goal is to predict the quantities of interest (e.g., velocity field,\ndrag, lift) more accurately by solving RANS equations with the Reynolds\nstresses obtained therefrom. \n\n"}

However, since X-rays undergo reprocessing by\nCompton scattering and photoelectric absorption when the line-of-sight to the\ncentral engine is heavily obscured, the recovery of the intrinsic {\\Gamma} is\nchallenging.

We compile results on X-ray spectral fitting of these sources with\nsensitive high-energy (E> 10 keV) NuSTAR data, where X-ray torus models which\ntake into account the reprocessing effects have been used to recover the\nintrinsic {\\Gamma} values and X-ray luminosities, L$_X$. With a simple\nbolometric correction to L$_X$ to calculate {\\lambda}$_{Edd}$, we find a\nstatistically significant correlation between {\\Gamma} and {\\lambda}$_{Edd}$ (p\n= 0.007). A linear fit to the data yields {\\Gamma} =\n(0.41$\\pm$0.18)log$_{10}${\\lambda}$_{Edd}$+(2.38$\\pm$ 0.20), which is\nstatistically consistent with results for unobscured AGN.

To the best of our\nknowledge, the GVZM PSD function is the only EEG noise model which has\nrelatively few parameters, matches recorded EEG PSD's with high accuracy from 0\nHz to over 30 Hz, and has approximately $1/f^\\theta$ behavior in the\nmid-frequencies without infinities. $Methods$: We validate this model using\nthree approaches.

Second, we present a class of mixed\nautoregressive models, which simulate brain background noise and whose\nperiodograms are asymptotic to the GVZM PSD. Third, we present two real-time\nestimation algorithms for steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)\nfrequencies, and analyze their performance statistically. $Results$: In\npairwise comparisons, the GVZM-based algorithms showed statistically\nsignificant accuracy improvement over two well-known and widely-used SSVEP\nestimators. $Conclusion$: The GVZM noise model can be a useful and reliable\ntechnique for EEG signal processing. $Significance$: Understanding EEG noise is\nessential for EEG-based neurology and applications such as real-time\nbrain-computer interfaces (BCIs), which must make accurate control decisions\nfrom very short data epochs.

For a\ngiven BCI paradigm, feature extractors and classifiers are tailored to the\ndistinct characteristics of its expected EEG control signal, limiting its\napplication to that specific signal.

Massive dust grains behave as aerodynamic particles in\nprimarily neutral dense gas, and thus are able to produce dramatic small-scale\nfluctuations in the dust-to-gas ratio. Hopkins & Lee (2016) directly simulated\nthe dynamics of neutral dust grains in super-sonic MHD turbulence, typical of\nGMCs, and showed that the dust-to-gas fluctuations can exceed factor ~1000 on\nsmall scales, with important implications for star formation, stellar\nabundances, and dust behavior and growth. However, even in primarily neutral\ngas in GMCs, dust grains are negatively charged and Lorentz forces are\nnon-negligible. Therefore, we extend our previous study by including the\neffects of Lorentz forces on charged grains (in addition to drag). For small\ncharged grains (sizes <0.1 micron), Lorentz forces suppress dust-to-gas ratio\nfluctuations, while for large grains (sizes >1 micron), Lorentz forces have\nessentially no effect, trends that are well explained with a simple theory of\ndust magnetization. In some special intermediate cases, Lorentz forces can\nenhance dust-gas segregation. Regardless, for the physically expected scaling\nof dust charge with grain size, we find the most important effects depend on\ngrain size (via the drag equation) with Lorentz forces/charge as a second-order\ncorrection. We show that the dynamics we consider are determined by three\ndimensionless numbers in the limit of weak background magnetic fields: the\nturbulent Mach number, a dust drag parameter (proportional to grain size) and a\ndust Lorentz parameter (proportional to grain charge); these allow us to\ngeneralize our simulations to a wide range of conditions. \n\n"}

The most extreme case\nreaches towards the Earth's core regime by lowering viscosity (magnetic Prandtl\nnumber Pm=0.1) while maintaining vigorous convection (magnetic Reynolds number\nRm>500) and rapid rotation (Ekman number E=1e-7), at the limit of what is\nfeasible on today's supercomputers. A detailed and comprehensive analysis\nhighlights several key features matching geomagnetic observations or dynamo\ntheory predictions -- all present together in the same simulation -- but it\nalso unveils interesting insights relevant for Earth's core dynamics.In this\nstrong-field, dipole-dominated dynamo simulation, the magnetic energy is one\norder of magnitude larger than the kinetic energy. The spatial distribution of\nmagnetic intensity is highly heterogeneous, and a stark dynamical contrast\nexists between the interior and the exterior of the tangent cylinder (the\ncylinder parallel to the axis of rotation that circumscribes the inner core).In\nthe interior, the magnetic field is strongest, and is associated with a\nvigorous twisted polar vortex, whose dynamics may occasionally lead to the\nformation of a reverse polar flux patch at the surface of the shell.\nFurthermore, the strong magnetic field also allows accumulation of light\nmaterial within the tangent cylinder, leading to stable stratification there.\nTorsional Alfv{\\'e}n waves are frequently triggered in the vicinity of the\ntangent cylinder and propagate towards the equator.Outside the tangent\ncylinder, the magnetic field inhibits the growth of zonal winds and the kinetic\nenergy is mostly non-zonal.

Much of this may be caused\nby the requirement that the gravitational sphere of influence of the black hole\nmust be resolved for the black-hole mass to be reliably estimated. We revisit\nthis issue by using a comprehensive galaxy evolution semi-analytic model, which\nself-consistently evolves supermassive black holes from high-redshift seeds via\ngas accretion and mergers, and also includes AGN feedback. Once tuned to\nreproduce the (mean) correlation of black-hole mass with velocity dispersion,\nthe model is unable to also account for the correlation with stellar mass. This\nbehaviour is independent of the model's parameters, thus suggesting an internal\ninconsistency in the data. The predicted distributions, especially at the\nlow-mass end, are also much broader than observed. However, if selection\neffects are included, the model's predictions tend to align with the\nobservations. We also demonstrate that the correlations between the residuals\nof the local scaling relations are more effective than the scaling relations\nthemselves at constraining AGN feedback models. In fact, we find that our\nsemi-analytic model, while in apparent broad agreement with the scaling\nrelations when accounting for selection biases, yields very weak correlations\nbetween their residuals at fixed stellar mass, in stark contrast with\nobservations. This problem persists when changing the AGN feedback strength,\nand is also present in the $z\\sim 0$ outputs of the hydrodynamic cosmological\nsimulation Horizon-AGN, which includes state-of-the-art treatments of AGN\nfeedback.

The most popular models for the\nULXs involve either intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) or stellar-mass black\nholes accreting at super-Eddington rates. Here we review the ULX properties.\nTheir X-ray spectra indicate a presence of hot winds in their accretion disks\nsupposing the supercritical accretion. In recent years, new surprising results\nwere discovered in X-ray data, ULX-pulsars and high-velocity outflows up to 0.2\nc. They are also in accordance with the super-Eddington accretion. However, the\nstrongest evidences come from optical spectroscopy. The spectra of the ULX\ncounterparts are very similar to that of SS433, the only known supercritical\naccretor in our Galaxy. The spectra are apparently of WNL type (late nitrogen\nWolf-Rayet stars) or LBV (luminous blue variables) in their hot state, which\nare very scarce stellar objects. We find that the spectra do not originate from\nWNL/LBV type donors but from very hot winds from the accretion disks, which\nhave similar physical conditions as the stellar winds from these stars. The\nresults suggest that bona-fide ULXs must constitute a homogeneous class of\nobjects, which most likely have supercritical accretion disks. \n\n"}

Lighthill (1971) originally proposed\nthat this burst-and-coast behavior can save fish energy during swimming by\ntaking advantage of the viscous Bone-Lighthill boundary layer thinning\nmechanism. Here, an additional inviscid Garrick mechanism is discovered that\nallows swimmers to control the ratio of their added mass thrust-producing\nforces to their circulatory drag-inducing forces by decreasing their duty\ncycle, DC, of locomotion. This mechanism can save intermittent swimmers as much\nas 60% of the energy it takes to swim continuously at the same speed. The\ninviscid energy savings are shown to increase with increasing amplitude of\nmotion, increase with decreasing Lighthill number, Li, and switch to an\nenergetic cost above continuous swimming for sufficiently low DC. Intermittent\nswimmers are observed to shed four vortices per cycle that form into groups\nthat are self-similar with the DC. In addition, previous thrust and power\nscaling laws of continuous self-propelled swimming are further generalized to\ninclude intermittent swimming. The key is that by averaging the thrust and\npower coefficients over only the bursting period then the intermittent problem\ncan be transformed into a continuous one. Furthermore, the intermittent thrust\nand power scaling relations are extended to predict the mean speed and cost of\ntransport of swimmers. By tuning a few coefficients with a handful of\nsimulations these self-propelled relations can become predictive.

One method to\nestimate brain connectivity is with electroencephalography (EEG) from which the\ncross-spectrum between different sensor locations is derived. We wish to test\nthe efficacy of tensor factorisation in the estimation of brain connectivity.\nMethods: Complex tensor factorisation based on PARAFAC2 is used to decompose\nthe EEG into scalp components described by the spatial, spectral, and complex\ntrial profiles. An EEG model in the complex domain was derived that shows the\nsuitability of PARAFAC2. A connectivity metric was also derived on the complex\ntrial profiles of the extracted components. Results: Results on a benchmark EEG\ndataset confirmed that PARAFAC2 can estimate connectivity better than\ntraditional tensor analysis such as PARAFAC within a range of signal-to-noise\nratios.

In addition to providing collimating media for gamma-ray\nburst jets, unbound outflows from these disks are an important source of mass\nejection and rapid neutron capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis.

The disk quickly reaches a\nbalance between heating from MRI-driven turbulence and neutrino cooling, which\nregulates the midplane electron fraction to a low equilibrium value $Y_\\text{e}\n\\approx 0.1$.

In\nconventional approaches, higher order tensors are `vectorized` via Tucker\ndecomposition to obtain lower order tensors. This will destroy the inherent\nhigh-order structures or resulting in undesired tensors, respectively. This\npaper introduces a probabilistic vectorial dimensionality reduction model for\ntensorial data. The model represents a tensor by employing a linear combination\nof same order basis tensors, thus it offers a mechanism to directly reduce a\ntensor to a vector. Under this expression, the projection base of the model is\nbased on the tensor CandeComp/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition and the number of free\nparameters in the model only grows linearly with the number of modes rather\nthan exponentially. A Bayesian inference has been established via the\nvariational EM approach. A criterion to set the parameters (factor number of CP\ndecomposition and the number of extracted features) is empirically given. The\nmodel outperforms several existing PCA-based methods and CP decomposition on\nseveral publicly available databases in terms of classification and clustering\naccuracy. \n\n"}

Abstract: The Telescope Array (TA) shows a 20$^{\\circ}$ hotspot as well as an excess of\nUHECRs above 50~EeV when compared with the Auger spectrum. We consider the\npossibility that both the TA excess and hotspot are due to a dominant source in\nthe Northern sky. We carry out detailed simulations of UHECR propagation in\nboth the intergalactic medium and the Galaxy, using different values for the\nintergalactic magnetic field. We consider two general classes of sources:\ntransients and steady, adopting a mixed UHECR composition that is consistent\nwith the one found by Auger. The spatial location of the sources is draw\nrandomly. We generate Auger-like and TA-like data sets from which we determine\nthe spectrum, the sky maps and the level of anisotropy. We find that, while\nsteady sources are favored over transients, it is unlikely to account for all\nthe currently available observational data.

Deep neural networks trained on object recognition datasets consist\nof multiple convolutional layers. These layers encode target appearance with\ndifferent levels of abstraction. For example, the outputs of the last\nconvolutional layers encode the semantic information of targets and such\nrepresentations are invariant to significant appearance variations. However,\ntheir spatial resolutions are too coarse to precisely localize the target. In\ncontrast, features from earlier convolutional layers provide more precise\nlocalization but are less invariant to appearance changes. We interpret the\nhierarchical features of convolutional layers as a nonlinear counterpart of an\nimage pyramid representation and explicitly exploit these multiple levels of\nabstraction to represent target objects. Specifically, we learn adaptive\ncorrelation filters on the outputs from each convolutional layer to encode the\ntarget appearance. We infer the maximum response of each layer to locate\ntargets in a coarse-to-fine manner. To further handle the issues with scale\nestimation and re-detecting target objects from tracking failures caused by\nheavy occlusion or out-of-the-view movement, we conservatively learn another\ncorrelation filter, that maintains a long-term memory of target appearance, as\na discriminative classifier.

Extensive experimental\nresults on large-scale benchmark datasets show that the proposed algorithm\nperforms favorably against state-of-the-art tracking methods. \n\n"}

To\navoid the bias of anecdotal tests towards a particular algorithm, the proposed\nprotocols are Monte Carlo sampling based, generating an ensemble of activity\npatches in each brain region identified in a given atlas. The sensitivity is\nmeasured by how much, on average, the reconstructed activity is concentrated in\nthe brain region of the simulated active patch. The specificity analysis is\nbased on Bayes factors, interpreting the estimated current activity as data for\ntesting the hypothesis that the active brain region is correctly identified,\nvs. the hypothesis of any erroneous attribution. The methodology allows the\npresence of a single or several simultaneous activity regions, without assuming\nthe knowledge of the number of active regions.

We briefly\ndiscuss the role of anisotropy in the occurrence and properties of such\ncascades. We then show that the cascade of some invariant, for example the\ntotal energy, may be transferred through nonlinear interactions to both the\nsmall scales and the large scales, with in each case a constant flux. This is\nin contrast to the classical picture, and we illustrate such a dual cascade in\nthe context of atmospheric and oceanic observations, direct numerical\nsimulations and modeling. We also show that this dual cascade of total energy\ncan in fact be decomposed in some cases into separate cascades of the kinetic\nand potential energies, provided the Froude and Rossby numbers are small\nenough. In all cases, the potential energy flux remains small, of the order of\n10% or less relative to the kinetic energy flux. Finally, we demonstrate that,\nin the small-scale inertial range, approximate equipartition between potential\nand kinetic modes is obtained, leading to an energy ratio close to one, with\nstrong departure at large scales due to the dominant kinetic energy inverse\ncascade and piling-up at the lowest spatial frequency, and at small scales due\nto unbalanced dissipation processes, even though the Prandtl number is equal to\none. \n\n"}

Here we emphasize that two families of\ncompact stars, viz., neutron stars and strange stars, can coexist in nature,\nand that neutron stars can get converted to strange stars through the\nnucleation process of quark matter in the stellar center. From our fully\ngeneral relativistic numerical computations of the structures of fast-spinning\ncompact stars, known as millisecond pulsars, we find that such a stellar\nconversion causes a simultaneous spin-up and decrease in gravitational mass of\nthese stars. This is a new type of millisecond pulsar evolution through a new\nmechanism, which gives rise to relatively lower mass compact stars with higher\nspin rates. This could have implication for the observed mass and spin\ndistributions of millisecond pulsars. Such a stellar conversion can also rescue\nsome massive, spin-supported millisecond pulsars from collapsing into black\nholes.

On the other hand, shallow diffuser angles create longer regions with\nlarge wall drag, which is also detrimental to pressure recovery. Thus, optimal\ndiffuser shapes strike a balance between the two effects. We use a simple model\nwhich describes the evolution of an approximate flow profile and pressure in\nthe diffuser. The model equations form the dynamics of an optimal control\nproblem where the control is the diffuser channel shape. A numerical\noptimisation approach is used to solve the optimal control problem and we use\nanalytical results to interpret the numerics in some limiting cases.

A tool for encoding and rapid learning of\n  memories by single neurons Abstract: Codifying memories is one of the fundamental problems of modern Neuroscience.\nThe functional mechanisms behind this phenomenon remain largely unknown.\nExperimental evidence suggests that some of the memory functions are performed\nby stratified brain structures such as, e.g., the hippocampus. In this\nparticular case, single neurons in the CA1 region receive a highly\nmultidimensional input from the CA3 area, which is a hub for information\nprocessing. We thus assess the implication of the abundance of neuronal\nsignalling routes converging onto single cells on the information processing.\nWe show that single neurons can selectively detect and learn arbitrary\ninformation items, given that they operate in high dimensions. The argument is\nbased on Stochastic Separation Theorems and the concentration of measure\nphenomena. We demonstrate that a simple enough functional neuronal model is\ncapable of explaining: i) the extreme selectivity of single neurons to the\ninformation content, ii) simultaneous separation of several uncorrelated\nstimuli or informational items from a large set, and iii) dynamic learning of\nnew items by associating them with already \"known\" ones.

For such HMMs, the marginal\ndistribution at any time position follows a Gaussian mixture distribution, a\nfact exploited to softly match, aka register, the states in two HMMs. We refer\nto such HMMs as Gaussian mixture model-HMM (GMM-HMM). The registration of\nstates is inspired by the intrinsic relationship of optimal transport and the\nWasserstein metric between distributions. Specifically, the components of the\nmarginal GMMs are matched by solving an optimal transport problem where the\ncost between components is the Wasserstein metric for Gaussian distributions.\nThe solution of the optimization problem is a fast approximation to the\nWasserstein metric between two GMMs. The new Aggregated Wasserstein distance is\na semi-metric and can be computed without generating Monte Carlo samples.

The distance is defined\nmeaningfully even for two HMMs that are estimated from data of different\ndimensionality, a situation that can arise due to missing variables. This\ndistance quantifies the dissimilarity of GMM-HMMs by measuring both the\ndifference between the two marginal GMMs and that between the two transition\nmatrices. Our new distance is tested on tasks of retrieval, classification, and\nt-SNE visualization of time series.

In this method,\nsolutions in the predictive regime are approximated using a linear\nsuperposition of parameter dependent basis. The sought after parametric\nreduced-basis are obtained by transporting the snapshots in a spatially and\nparametrically dependent transport field. Key to the proposed approach is the\nobservation that the transport fields are typically smooth and continuous,\ndespite the solution themselves not being so.

As for the dissipative term: first it explicitly\nbreaks time reversibility; second it produces a small-scale sink for the energy\ntransfer that remains effective even in the limit of vanishing viscosity. As a\nresult, it is not clear how to disentangle the time irreversibility originating\nfrom the non-equilibrium energy cascade from the explicit time-reversal\nsymmetry breaking due to the viscous term. To this aim, in this paper we\ninvestigate the properties of the energy transfer in turbulent Shell models by\nusing a reversible viscous mechanism, avoiding any explicit breaking of the $t\n\\rightarrow -t$ symmetry. We probe time-irreversibility by studying the\nstatistics of Lagrangian power, which is found to be asymmetric under time\nreversal also in the time-reversible model.

Accurately measuring $t_{\\rm ff}$\nis crucial because according to numerical simulations cold gas condensation and\nstrong feedback occur in cluster cores with min($t_{\\rm cool}/t_{\\rm ff}$)\nbelow a threshold value close to 10.

In this paper we compare numerical\nsimulations of feedback AGN (Active Galactic Nuclei) jets interacting with the\nintracluster medium (ICM), with and without a BCG potential. We find that, for\na fixed feedback efficiency, the presence of a BCG does not significantly\naffect the temperature but increases (decreases) the core density (entropy) on\naverage. Most importantly, min($t_{\\rm cool}/t_{\\rm ff}$) is only affected\nslightly by the inclusion of the BCG gravity.

The impact of the new\nneutrino interaction upon the flavor transformation above the neutrinosphere is\ncalculated in the context of the multi-angle \"neutrino bulb model\".

But computing and learning\ncapabilities of RSNN models have remained poor, at least in comparison with\nartificial neural networks (ANNs). We address two possible reasons for that.\nOne is that RSNNs in the brain are not randomly connected or designed according\nto simple rules, and they do not start learning as a tabula rasa network.\nRather, RSNNs in the brain were optimized for their tasks through evolution,\ndevelopment, and prior experience. Details of these optimization processes are\nlargely unknown. But their functional contribution can be approximated through\npowerful optimization methods, such as backpropagation through time (BPTT).\n  A second major mismatch between RSNNs in the brain and models is that the\nlatter only show a small fraction of the dynamics of neurons and synapses in\nthe brain. We include neurons in our RSNN model that reproduce one prominent\ndynamical process of biological neurons that takes place at the behaviourally\nrelevant time scale of seconds: neuronal adaptation. We denote these networks\nas LSNNs because of their Long short-term memory. The inclusion of adapting\nneurons drastically increases the computing and learning capability of RSNNs if\nthey are trained and configured by deep learning (BPTT combined with a rewiring\nalgorithm that optimizes the network architecture). In fact, the computational\nperformance of these RSNNs approaches for the first time that of LSTM networks.\nIn addition RSNNs with adapting neurons can acquire abstract knowledge from\nprior learning in a Learning-to-Learn (L2L) scheme, and transfer that knowledge\nin order to learn new but related tasks from very few examples.

The induced lift force is\nattributed to an elastohydrodynamic coupling that arises from the breaking of\nthe flow reversal symmetry induced by the elastic deformation of the\ntranslating object or the interface. Here we derive explicit analytical\nexpressions for the quasi-steady state lift force exerted on a rigid spherical\nparticle translating parallel to a finite-sized membrane exhibiting a\nresistance toward both shear and bending. Our analytical approach proceeds\nthrough the application of the Lorentz reciprocal theorem so as to obtain the\nsolution of the flow problem using a perturbation technique for small\ndeformations of the membrane.

In particular, we examine the critical choice of a loss function in\norder to handle the notorious imbalance problem that plagues both the input and\noutput of a learning model. The input imbalance refers to the class-imbalance\nin the input training samples (i.e., small foreground objects embedded in an\nabundance of background voxels, as well as organs of varying sizes). The output\nimbalance refers to the imbalance between the false positives and false\nnegatives of the inference model. In order to tackle both types of imbalance\nduring training and inference, we introduce a new curriculum learning based\nloss function. Specifically, we leverage Dice similarity coefficient to deter\nmodel parameters from being held at bad local minima and at the same time\ngradually learn better model parameters by penalizing for false\npositives/negatives using a cross entropy term. We evaluated the proposed loss\nfunction on three datasets: whole body positron emission tomography (PET) scans\nwith 5 target organs, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) prostate scans, and\nultrasound echocardigraphy images with a single target organ i.e., left\nventricular. We show that a simple network architecture with the proposed\nintegrative loss function can outperform state-of-the-art methods and results\nof the competing methods can be improved when our proposed loss is used. \n\n"}

As the\nresulting transition matrix is sparse and stochastic, this reduces the proposal\nhypothesis search space from $O(n^f)$ to the cardinality of the thresholded\nmatrix.

Broad emission features of H and He develop after\n>10 days. The spectrum remains extremely hot throughout its evolution, and the\nphotospheric radius contracts with time (receding below R<10^14 cm after 1\nmonth).

Until now, such calculations were done\nunder the assumption that initial binary parameter distributions were\nindependent. Here, we implement empirically derived inter-correlated\ndistributions of initial binary parameters primary mass (M1), mass ratio (q),\norbital period (P), and eccentricity (e). Unexpectedly, the introduction of\ninter-correlated initial binary parameters leads to only a small decrease in\nthe predicted merger rates by a factor of 2 $-$ 3 relative to the previously\nused non-correlated initial distributions. The formation of compact object\nmergers in the isolated classical binary evolution favors initial binaries with\nstars of comparable masses (q = 0.5 $-$ 1) at intermediate orbital periods (log\nP (days) = 2 $-$ 4). New distributions slightly shift the mass ratios towards\nsmaller values with respect to the previously used flat q distribution, which\nis the dominant effect decreasing the rates. New orbital periods only\nnegligibly increase the number of progenitors. Additionally, we discuss the\nuncertainty of merger rate predictions associated with possible variations of\nthe massive-star initial mass function (IMF). We argue that evolutionary\ncalculations should be normalized to a star formation rate (SFR) that is\nobtained from the observed amount of UV light at wavelength 1500{\\AA} (SFR\nindicator). In this case, contrary to recent reports, the uncertainty of the\nIMF does not affect the rates by more than a factor of 2. Any change to the IMF\nslope for massive stars requires a change of SFR in a way that counteracts the\nimpact of IMF variations on the merger rates. In contrast, we suggest that the\nuncertainty in cosmic SFR at low metallicity can be a significant factor at\nplay. \n\n"}

But an open question is how accurately the superdroplet\nalgorithm accounts for fluctuations in the collisional aggregation process.\nSuch fluctuations are particularly important in dilute suspensions. Even in the\nabsence of turbulence, Poisson fluctuations of collision times in dilute\nsuspensions may result in substantial variations in the growth process,\nresulting in a broad distribution of growth times to reach a certain droplet\nsize. We quantify the accuracy of the superdroplet algorithm in describing the\nfluctuating growth history of a larger droplet that settles under the effect of\ngravity in a quiescent fluid and collides with a dilute suspension of smaller\ndroplets that were initially randomly distributed in space ('lucky droplet\nmodel'). We assess the effect of fluctuations upon the growth history of the\nlucky droplet and compute the distribution of cumulative collision times. The\nlatter is shown to be sensitive enough to detect the subtle increase of\nfluctuations associated with collisions between multiple lucky droplets. The\nsuperdroplet algorithm incorporates fluctuations in two distinct ways: through\nthe random spatial distribution of superdroplets and through the Monte Carlo\ncollision algorithm involved. Using specifically designed numerical\nexperiments, we show that both on their own give an accurate representation of\nfluctuations.

This is made possible by learning a projection\nbetween a feature space and a semantic space (e.g. attribute space). Key to ZSL\nis thus to learn a projection function that is robust against the often large\ndomain gap between the seen and unseen classes.

In contrast\nto what is known from biology, these networks largely rely on feedforward\nconnections, ignoring the influence of recurrent connections.

To address these issues, we\ncombine traditional supervised learning via backpropagation with a specialized\nunsupervised learning rule to learn lateral connections between neurons within\na convolutional neural network. These connections have been shown to optimally\nintegrate information from the surround, generating extra-classical receptive\nfields for the neurons in our new proposed model (CNNEx). Models with optimal\nlateral connections are more robust to noise and achieve better performance on\nnoisy versions of the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.

This creates the feedback\nthat limits the X-ray luminosity of the compact secondary. Wind inhibition\nmight be weakened by the effect of small-scale wind inhomogeneities (clumping)\npossibly affecting the limiting X-ray luminosity. We study the influence of\nX-ray irradiation on the stellar wind for different radial distributions of\nclumping. We calculate hot star wind models with external irradiation and\nclumping using our global wind code. The models are calculated for different\nparameters of the binary. We determine the parameters for which the X-ray wind\nionization leads to a decrease of the radiative force. This causes a decrease\nof the wind velocity and even of the mass-loss rate in the case of extreme\nX-ray irradiation. Clumping weakens the effect of X-ray irradiation because it\nfavours recombination and leads to an increase of the wind mass-loss rate. The\nbest match between the models and observed properties of high-mass X-ray\nbinaries (HMXB) is derived with radially variable clumping. We describe the\ninfluence of X-ray irradiation on the terminal velocity and on the mass-loss\nrate in a parametric way. The X-ray luminosities predicted within the Bondi\ntheory agree nicely with observations when accounting for X-ray irradiation.\nThe ionizing feedback regulates the accretion onto the compact companion\nresulting in a relatively stable X-ray source. The wind-powered accretion model\ncan account for large luminosities in HMXBs only when introducing the ionizing\nfeedback. There are two possible states following from the dependence of X-ray\nluminosity on the wind terminal velocity and mass-loss rate.

We identify all plausible Roche-lobe overflowing binaries\nat the start of mass transfer, and compare our theoretical mass transfer tracks\nto the population of well-studied Milky Way LMXBs. The mass transferring\nevolution depends on the accepted magnetic braking (MB) law for angular\nmomentum loss. The most common MB prescription (\"Skumanich MB\") originated from\nobservations of the time-dependence of rotational braking of Sun-type stars,\nwhere the angular momentum loss rate depends on the donor mass $M_d$, donor\nradius $R_d$, and rotation rate $\\Omega$, $\\dot{J} \\propto M_d R_d^{\\gamma}\n\\Omega^3$. The functional form of the Skumanich MB can be also obtained\ntheoretically assuming a radial magnetic field, isotropic isothermal winds, and\nboosting of the magnetic field by rotation.

However, if the atmosphere contains a dilute condensible that is\nradiatively active, such as water or methane, then an increase in gravity will\ngenerally lead to a cooling of the planet because the total path length of the\ncondensible will be reduced as gravity increases, leading to a reduction in the\ngreenhouse effect. Furthermore, the specific humidity will decrease, leading to\nchanges in the moist adiabatic lapse rate, in the equator-to-pole heat\ntransport, and in the surface energy balance because of changes in the sensible\nand latent fluxes. These effects are all demonstrated both by theoretical\narguments and by numerical simulations with moist and dry general circulation\nmodels. \n\n"}

The high count rates allow us\nto track individual QPO peaks, and we exploit this to develop a QPO folding\ntechnique. In contrast to previous QPO studies with RXTE, we emphasize the high\nenergy QPO properties and report the detection of a QPO in the 60-124 keV\nenergy band. Our technique allows us, for the first time, to measure the phase\nof the QPO harmonics relative to the fundamental. Variation in this phase\ndifference leads to changes in the shape of the QPO profile with energy and\nover time. The strength of the QPO fundamental increases up to 19 keV, but the\ndata do not suggest that the strength continues to increase above this energy.\nIn some cases, the QPO amplitudes in the 30-60 keV and 60-124 keV energy bands\nare significantly less than in the 13-19 keV and 19-29 keV energy bands. We\nalso use our technique to measure the phase lag of the QPO fundamental and\nharmonics.

The phase lags and coherence measures are used\nto distinguish three types of low-frequency QPOs (one more than those reported\nby Wijnands, Homan, & van der Klis 1999). For the most common type, the phase\nlag is correlated with both the QPO frequency and the amplitude. The physical\nsignificance of the QPO types is evident in the relationships between QPO\nproperties and the apparent temperature and flux from the accretion disk. There\nis also a clear pattern in how the QPO types relate to the presence of\nhigh-frequency QPOs. In general, both the amplitude and the Q value\n(freq./FWHM) of low-frequency QPOs decrease as the high-frequency oscillations\nincrease in frequency (100 to 284 Hz) and in Q value. We speculate that the\nantagonism between low-frequency and high-frequency QPOs arises from competing\nstructures in a perturbed accretion disk. However, we find that the frequencies\nof slow (< 20 Hz) and fast (> 100 Hz) QPOs are not correlated. In addition, we\nencounter systematic problems in attempting to reliably compare the QPO\nfrequencies with broad features in the power continuum, since there are a\nvariable number of such features in the power spectra. These results cast some\ndoubt on the reported global relationship between QPOs from neutrons stars and\nthose from black hole systems. \n\n"}

Out of a total of six times ~20\nks, we focus here only on the three observations during which GRS 1915+105 is\nfound in a steady C-state (referred to as class $\\chi$) resulting in a total of\n\\~50 ks. During these observations, we detect low frequency quasi-periodic\noscillations with high (~14 %) rms amplitude in the 2-40 keV energy range.\nContrary to what is usually observed in GRS 1915+105, in most of our\nobservations the QPO frequency presents no correlation with the RXTE/PCA count\nrate, nor with the RXTE/ASM count rate. We present, for the first time, high\nresolution (22 spectral channels) 2-40 keV spectral fits of the energy\ndependence of the QPO amplitude (``QPO spectra''). The QPO spectra are well\nmodeled with a cut-off power law except on one occasion where a single power\nlaw gives a satisfactory fit (with no cut-off at least up to ~40 keV). The\ncut-off energy evolves significantly from one observation to the other, from a\nvalue of ~21.8 keV to ~30 keV in the other observations where it is detected.\nWe discuss the possible origin of this behavior and suggest that the compact\njet detected in the radio contributes to the hard X-ray (> 20 keV) mostly\nthrough synchrotron emission, whereas the X-ray emitted below 20 keV would\noriginate through inverse Compton scattering. The dependence of the QPO\namplitude on the energy can be understood if the modulation of the X-ray flux\nis contained in the Comptonized photons and not in the synchrotron ones. \n\n"}
