Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on\nthe role that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in\nglobular clusters, e.g., influencing the distribution of horizontal branch\nstars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of some globular clusters, and in\nforming low mass white dwarfs. \n\n"}

In a few\nwell-studied cases, these ``short GRBs with extended emission'' show no\nevidence for a bright associated supernova (SN). We propose that these events\nare produced by the formation and early evolution of a highly magnetized,\nrapidly rotating neutron star (a ``proto-magnetar'') which is formed from the\naccretion-induced collapse (AIC) of a white dwarf (WD), the merger and collapse\nof a WD-WD binary, or, perhaps, the merger of a double neutron star binary. The\ninitial emission spike is powered by accretion onto the proto-magnetar from a\nsmall disk that is formed during the AIC or merger event. The extended emission\nis produced by a relativistic wind that extracts the rotational energy of the\nproto-magnetar on a timescale ~10-100 s. The ~3-10 s delay between the prompt\nand extended emission is the time required for the newly-formed proto-magnetar\nto cool sufficiently that the neutrino-heated wind from its surface becomes\nultra-relativistic. Because a proto-magnetar ejects little or no Ni56 (< 1e-3\nM_sun), these events should not produce a bright SN-like transient. We model\nthe extended emission from GRB060614 using spin-down calculations of a cooling\nproto-magnetar, finding reasonable agreement with observations for a magnetar\nwith an initial rotation period of ~1 ms and a surface dipole field of ~3e15 G.\nIf GRBs are indeed produced by AIC or WD-WD mergers, they should occur within a\nmixture of both early and late-type galaxies and should not produce strong\ngravitational wave emission.

Based on a map of the flux ratio of\n350micron/450micron, we identify three distinct regions: a bipolar feature that\ncoincides with the large scale CO bipolar outflow; a cocoon-like region that\nencases the bipolar feature and has a warm surface; and a cold layer outside of\nthe cocoon region. The complex patterns of the flux ratio map indicates that\nthe clump is no longer uniform in terms of temperature as well as dust\nproperties. The CO emission near the systemic velocity traces the dense clump\nand the outer layer of the clump shows narrow line widths (< ~3 km/s). The\nclump has a velocity gradient of ~ 2 km/s pc^{-1}, which we interpret as due to\nrotation of the clump, as the equilibrium mass (~ 200 Msun) is comparable to\nthe LTE mass obtained from the CO line. Over a scale of ~ 1 pc, the clump\nrotates in the opposite sense with respect to the >~ 0.03 pc disk associated\nwith the (proto)star.

For this method, it is necessary to know the inclination of the\nX-ray-producing inner region of the disk. Since the inner disk is expected to\nbe oriented perpendicular to the spin axis of the hole, the usual practice is\nto assume that the black hole spin is aligned with the orbital angular momentum\nvector of the binary, and to estimate the inclination of the latter from\nellipsoidal modulations in the light curve of the secondary star.

The surface density profile of the disk is determined by\ndetailed angular momentum conservation, starting from the distribution of\nspecific angular momentum as found in cosmological simulations.

In representative PDM and BDM models we find that\nbaryons contribute decisively to the evolution of the central region, leading\nto an isothermal DM cusp, and to a flat DM density core -- the result of\nheating by dynamical friction of the substructure during a quiescent evolution\nepoch. This process ablates the cold gas from an embedded disk, cutting the\nstar formation rate by ~10, and heats up the spheroidal gas and stellar\ncomponents, triggering their expansion. The substructure is more resilient in\nthe presence of baryons. The disk which formed from inside-out as gas\ndominated, is transformed into an intermediate Hubble type by z ~ 2 and to an\nearly type by z ~ 0.5, based on its gas contents and spheroidal-to-disk stellar\nmass ratio. Only a relatively small ~20% fraction of DM particles in PDM and\nBDM models are bound within the radius of maximal circular velocity in the halo\n-- most of the DM particles perform larger radial excursions. We also find that\nthe fraction of baryons within the halo virial radius somewhat increases during\nthe major mergers and decreases during the minor mergers. The net effect\nappears to be negligible. While the substructure is being tidally-disrupted,\nmixing of its debris in the halo is not efficient and becomes even less so with\nz. The streamers formed after z ~ 1 survive largely to the present time -- an\nimportant implication for embedded disk evolution. \n\n"}

These external radiation fields control the amount\nof the inverse Compton radiation with respect to the synchrotron flux.\nTherefore the predicted spectral energy distribution (SED) will depend on where\nthe jet dissipates part of its energy to produce the observed radiation.

They could have been recognized by BATSE as short/hard GRBs should\nthey have occurred at z <= 1.

We reiterate the definitions of Type I/II GRBs\nand review the observational criteria and their physical motivations. Contrary\nto the traditional approach of assigning the physical category based on the\ngamma-ray properties (duration, hardness, and spectral lag), we take an\nalternative approach to define the Type I and Type II Gold Samples using\nseveral criteria that are more directly related to the GRB progenitors, and\nstudy the properties of the two Gold Samples and compare them with the\ntraditional long/soft and short/hard samples.

Using recent\nrelativistic magnetohydrodynamical numerical simulation results to calibrate\nthe efficiency of angular momentum transfer in the flow, we find that an ADAF\nflow will spin a black hole up (or down) to an equilibrium value of about 96%\nof the maximal spin value in the absence of jets.

Such a large instantaneous inflow\ncannot have persisted over a Hubble time. The central constant-entropy\ntemperature peak recently observed in the innermost 150 parsecs is explained by\ncompressive heating as gas flows toward the central massive black hole. Since\nthe cooling time of this gas is only a few million years, NGC 4649 provides the\nmost acutely concentrated known example of the cooling flow problem in which\nthe time-integrated apparent mass that has flowed into the galactic core\nexceeds the total mass observed there. This paradox can be resolved by\nintermittent outflows of energy or mass driven by accretion energy released\nnear the black hole. Inflowing gas is also required at intermediate kpc radii\nto explain the ellipticity of X-ray isophotes due to spin-up by mass ejected by\nstars that rotate with the galaxy and to explain local density and temperature\nprofiles. We provide evidence that many luminous elliptical galaxies undergo\nsimilar inflow spin-up.

The GeV emission has three main properties: (i) its duration is\noften longer than the duration of the softer emission detected by the Gamma\nBurst Monitor (GBM) onboard Fermi [this confirms earlier results from the\nEnergetic Gamma-Ray Experiment Telescope (EGRET)]; (ii) its spectrum is\nconsistent with F(v) propto v^(-1) and does not show strong spectral evolution;\n(iii) for the brightest bursts, the flux detected by the LAT decays as a power\nlaw with a typical slope: t^(-1.5). We argue that the observed >0.1 GeV flux\ncan be interpreted as afterglow emission shortly following the start of the\nprompt phase emission as seen at smaller frequencies. The decay slope is what\nexpected if the fireball emission is produced in the radiative regime, i.e. all\ndissipated energy is radiated away.

No dark sector is required to obtain boosted annihilation cross\nsections. A mild hierarchy between the radion and DM masses can be natural due\nto the pseudo-Goldstone boson nature of the radion. Implications of Sommerfeld\nenhancement in warped grand unified theory (GUT) models, where proton stability\nimplies a DM candidate, are studied. We show, via partially unified Pati-Salam\ngroup, how to incorporate a custodial symmetry for Z->b\\bar b into the GUT\nframework such that a few TeV Kaluza-Klein (KK) mass scale is allowed by\nprecision tests. The model with smallest fully unified SO(10) representation\nallows us to decouple the DM from the electroweak sector.

Results for the diffusion model\n  combining B/C and radioactive nuclei Abstract: On-going measurements of the cosmic radiation (nuclear, electronic, and\ngamma-ray) are shedding new light on cosmic-ray physics. A comprehensive\npicture of these data relies on an accurate determination of the transport and\nsource parameters of propagation models. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo is used to\nobtain these parameters in a diffusion model. From the measurement of the B/C\nratio and radioactive cosmic-ray clocks, we calculate their probability density\nfunctions, with a special emphasis on the halo size L of the Galaxy and the\nlocal underdense bubble of size r_h. The analysis relies on the USINE code for\npropagation and on a Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique (Putze et al. 2009,\npaper I of this series) for the parameter determination. As found in previous\nstudies, the B/C best-fit model favours diffusion/convection/reacceleration\n(Model III) over diffusion/reacceleration (Model II). A combined fit on B/C and\nthe isotopic ratios (10Be/9Be, 26Al/27Al, 36Cl/Cl) leads to L ~ 8 kpc and r_h ~\n120 pc for the best-fit Model III. This value for r_h is consistent with direct\nmeasurements of the local interstallar medium. For Model II, L ~ 4 kpc and r_h\nis consistent with zero. We showed the potential and usefulness of the Markov\nChain Monte Carlo technique in the analysis of cosmic-ray measurements in\ndiffusion models. The size of the diffusive halo depends crucially on the value\nof the diffusion slope delta, and also on the presence/absence of the local\nunderdensity damping effect on radioactive nuclei. More precise data from\non-going experiments are expected to clarify this issue. \n\n"}

Determination of\nstellar parameters and element abundances was based on analysis of high-quality\nVLT/UVES spectra. The surface gravity was calculated from the NLTE ionization\nbalance between Fe I and Fe II, and Ca I and Ca II. Accurate abundances for a\ntotal of 40 elements and for 23 neutron-capture elements beyond Sr and up to Th\nwere determined.

We show in this paper,\nanalytically and with one-dimensional numerical simulations, that this property\nis also shared by certain axisymmetric MRI modes in vertically-stratified\nshearing boxes. These channel flows rapidly capture significant amounts of\nmagnetic and kinetic energy, and thus are vulnerable to secondary shear\ninstabilities. We examine these parasites in the vertically stratified context,\nand estimate the maximum amplitudes that channels attain before they are\ndestroyed.

The prominence of these\nflows and their destruction place enormous demands on simulations, but channels\nin their initial stages also offer a useful check on numerical codes.

A candidate\noptical counterpart to PSRB1055-52 was proposed by Mignani and coworkers based\non Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations performed in 1996, in one spectral\nband only. We report on HST observations of this field carried out in 2008, in\nfour spectral bands. The astrometric and photometric analyses of these data\nconfirm the identification of the proposed candidate as the pulsar's optical\ncounterpart. Similarly to other middle-aged pulsars, its optical-UV spectrum\ncan be described by the sum of a power-law (PLO) component, presumably emitted\nfrom the pulsar magnetosphere, and a Rayleigh-Jeans (RJ) component emitted from\nthe NS surface. The spectral index of the PLO component, alpha_O=1.05+/-0.34,\nis larger than for other pulsars with optical counterparts.

However, the AGNs found in\ndeep X-ray surveys are often too weak to allow direct measurement of the column\ndensity of obscuring matter. One method adopted in recent years to identify\nheavily obscured, Compton-thick AGNs under such circumstances is to use the\nobserved mid-infrared to X-ray luminosity ratio as a proxy for the column\ndensity. This is based on the supposition that the amount of energy lost by the\nilluminating X-ray continuum to the obscuring matter and reprocessed into\ninfrared emission is directly related to the column density and that the proxy\nis not sensitive to other physical parameters of the system (aside from\ncontamination by dust emission from, for example, star-forming regions). Using\nMonte Carlo simulations, we find that the energy losses experienced by the\nilluminating X-ray continuum in the obscuring matter are far more sensitive to\nthe shape of the X-ray continuum and to the covering factor of the X-ray\nreprocessor than they are to the column density of the material. Specifically\nwe find that it is possible for the infrared to X-ray luminosity ratio for a\nCompton-thin source to be just as large as that for a Compton-thick source even\nwithout any contamination from dust. Since the intrinsic X-ray continuum and\ncovering factor of the reprocessor are poorly constrained from deep X-ray\nsurvey data, we conclude that the mid-infrared to X-ray luminosity ratio is not\na reliable proxy for the column density of obscuring matter in AGNs even when\nthere is no other contribution to the mid-infrared luminosity aside from X-ray\nreprocessing.

This conclusion was obtained by extrapolating the apparent orientation\nof the narrow line region to the inner parts of the ionisation cones. We show\nthat future measurements of the soft X-ray polarisation vector unambiguously\ndetermine the orientation of the ionisation cones. Furthermore, X-ray\npolarimetry across a broad photon energy range may independently verify the\nmisalignment between the ionisation cones and the axis of the torus. To model\nthe expected polarisation percentage and position angle, we apply the radiative\ntransfer code STOKES. Reprocessing of the primary X-ray radiation takes place\nin the accretion disc, the surrounding equatorial torus and the inclined,\nionised outflows. We also examine additional equatorial scattering occurring in\nbetween the accretion disc and the inner surfaces of the torus.

These features are often interpreted as arising from high velocity\noutflows intrinsic to the BL Lac object, therefore providing important\ninformation about the inner environment around the central engine. However,\nsuch absorption features have not been observed more recently with\nhigh-resolution X-ray telescopes such as Chandra and XMM-Newton. In this paper,\nwe report the detection of a transient X-ray absorption feature intrinsic to\nthe BL Lac object H 2356-309 with the Chandra X-ray Telescope. This BL Lac\nobject was observed during XMM cycle 7, Chandra cycle 8 and 10, as part of our\ncampaign to investigate X-ray absorption produced by the warm-hot intergalactic\nmedium (WHIM) residing in the foreground large scale superstructure. During one\nof the 80 ksec, Chandra cycle 10 observations, a transient absorption feature\nwas detected at 3.3-sigma (or 99.9% confidence level, accounting for the number\nof trials), which we identify as the OVIII K-alpha line produced by an absorber\nintrinsic to the BL Lac object.

Using atomic hydrogen (HI) data, mostly\nfrom THINGS, we predict the local mean CO velocity from the mean HI velocity.\nBy renormalizing the CO velocity axis so that zero corresponds to the local\nmean HI velocity we are able to stack spectra coherently over large regions as\nfunction of radius. This enables us to measure CO intensities with high\nsignificance as low as Ico = 0.3 K km/s (H2_SD = 1 Msun/pc2), an improvement of\nabout one order of magnitude over previous studies. We detect CO out to radii\nRgal = R25 and find the CO radial profile to follow a uniform exponential\ndecline with scale length of 0.2 R25. Comparing our sensitive CO profiles to\nmatched profiles of HI, Halpha, FUV, and IR emission at 24um and 70um, we\nobserve a tight, roughly linear relation between CO and IR intensity that does\nnot show any notable break between regions that are dominated by molecular (H2)\ngas (H2_SD > HI_SD) and those dominated by atomic gas (H2_SD < HI_SD). We use\ncombinations of FUV+24um and Halpha+24um to estimate the recent star formation\nrate (SFR) surface density, SFR_SD, and find approximately linear relations\nbetween SFR_SD and H2_SD. We interpret this as evidence for stars forming in\nmolecular gas with little dependence on the local total gas surface density.\nWhile galaxies display small internal variations in the SFR-to-H2 ratio, we do\nobserve systematic galaxy-to-galaxy variations. These galaxy-to-galaxy\nvariations dominate the scatter in relations between CO and SFR tracers\nmeasured at large scales. The variations have the sense that less massive\ngalaxies exhibit larger ratios of SFR-to-CO than massive galaxies. Unlike the\nSFR-to-CO ratio, the balance between HI and H2 depends strongly on the total\ngas surface density and radius. It must also depend on additional parameters. \n\n"}

In this paper, we show the effect of metallicity on the DTD\nof SNe Ia from single-degenerate models (including WD + MS and WD+RG channels).\nVia a binary population synthesis approach, we find that the DTD from a low\nmetallicity population is significantly delayed compared with that from a high\nmetallicity one. In addition, we also find that a substantial fraction of SNe\nIa have a delay time shorter than 1 Gyr, and the fraction of SNe Ia with short\ndelay times increases with metallicity, i.e. about 35% for Z=0.001, while more\nthan 70% for Z=0.02. These results would help to qualitatively explain the\nresult of Strolger et al. (2010). Furthermore, we noticed that the contribution\nof WD + RG channel from the low metallicity population is higher than that from\nthe high metallicity one. However, we can not quantitatively obtain a DTD\nconsistent with the results of Strolger et al.

We find that flare\ncandidates appear in different types of SGRB host galaxy environments and show\nno clear correlation with the X-ray afterglow lifetime; flare candidates are\ndetected both in SGRBs with a bright extended emission in the soft gamma-rays\nand in SGRBs which do not show such component.

In particular,the main parameter driving the\nduration evolution of X-ray variability episodes in both classes is found to be\nthe elapsed time from the explosion, with very limited dependence on the\ndifferent progenitors, environments, central engine life-times, prompt\nvariability time-scales and energy budgets. On the contrary, SGRB flare\ncandidates significantly differ from LGRB flares in terms of peak luminosity,\nisotropic energy, flare-to-prompt luminosity ratio and relative variability\nflux.

Spectral modeling of correlated multiwavelength data gives the comoving\nmagnetic field strength, the bulk outflow Lorentz factor and the emission\nregion size. Assuming the validity of the SSC model, the Hillas condition shows\nthat only in rare cases can such sources accelerate protons to much above 10^19\neV, so > 10^20 eV ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) are likely to be heavy\nions if powered by this type of radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN).\nSurvival of nuclei is shown to be possible in TeV BL Lacs and misaligned\ncounterparts with weak photohadronic emissions.

The remnant is composed of a central pulsar wind nebula and a\nbright partial shell in the south that is visible at radio, IR, and X-ray\nwavelengths. The X-ray emission can be modeled by either a single thermal\ncomponent with a temperature of ~ 1.5 keV, or with two thermal components with\ntemperatures of 1.5 and 0.2 keV.

The X-ray\nand IR emission in the shell are spatially correlated, suggesting that the dust\nparticles are collisionally heated by the X-ray emitting gas. The IR spectrum\nof the shell is dominated by continuum emission from dust with little, or no\nline emission.

However, the only numerical\nevidence for this has come from alpha disk models, where the magnetic field\nevolution is not followed, and the effect of turbulence is parametrized by\nLaplacian viscosity. We aim to establish the phenomenology of the flow in the\ntransition in 3D resistive-magnetohydrodynamical models. We model the\ntransition by a sharp jump in resistivity, as expected in the inner dead zone\nboundary, using the Pencil Code to simulate the flow. We find that vortices are\nreadily excited in the dead side of the transition. We measure the mass\naccretion rate finding similar levels of Reynolds stress at the dead and active\nzones, at the $\\alpha\\approx 10^{-2}$ level. The vortex sits in a pressure\nmaximum and does not migrate, surviving until the end of the simulation. A\npressure maximum in the active zone also triggers the RWI. The magnetized\nvortex that results should be disrupted by parasitical magneto-elliptic\ninstabilities, yet it subsists in high resolution.

In this paper, we explore to what extent EMRI observations with LISA or\neLISA/NGO might be able to distinguish between General Relativity and a\nparticular modification of it, known as Dynamical Chern-Simons Modified\nGravity.

Transport to Earth through the\ninterstellar medium is expected to affect the cosmic ray properties as well.\nHowever, the observed anisotropy of TeV cosmic rays and its energy dependence\ncannot be explained with diffusion models of particle propagation in the\nGalaxy.

The observation of a highly significant localized\nexcess region of cosmic rays from the apparent direction of the downstream\ninterstellar flow at 1-10 TeV energies might provide the first experimental\nevidence that the heliotail can affect the transport of energetic particles. In\nparticular, TeV cosmic rays propagating through the heliotail interact with the\n100-300 AU wide magnetic field polarity domains generated by the 11 year\ncycles.

We\ndemonstrate that the X-ray gas exhibits a bipolar morphology in the\nnortheast-southwest direction, indicating that it may be outflowing from the\ngalaxy. The mass and energy budget of the outflow can be maintained by evolved\nstars and SNe Ia, respectively. The X-ray gas in NGC4697 has an average\ntemperature of kT ~ 0.3 keV, and a significantly broader distribution than the\nstellar light. The total gas mass within 90 arcsec (~5.1 kpc) is ~2.1 x 10^8\nM_sun, hence the gas mass fraction is ~0.4%. Based on the distribution and\nphysical parameters of the X-ray gas, we conclude that it is most likely in\nhydrostatic equilibrium, although a subsonic outflow may be present. \n\n"}

Using a\nphysical-evolution model for blazars with a luminosity dependent evolution\n(LDDE) and an observationally-determined luminosity-dependent blazar spectral\nenergy distribution (SED), we find that blazars can account for the observed\nanisotropy of the DGRB consistent with their observed source-count\ndistribution, but are in turn constrained in contributing significantly to the\nobserved DGRB intensity.

This change in behaviour has been variously\nattributed to either the X-rays switching from being produced in the flow to\nbeing dominated by the jet, or to the flow switching seed photons from the disc\nto self generated seed photons from cyclo-synchrotron. Here we build a simple\ntruncated disc, hot inner flow, plus standard conical synchrotron jet model to\nexplore what this predicts for the X-ray emission mechanism as a function of\nmass accretion rate.\n  We find that the change in X-ray spectral index can be quantitatively (not\njust qualitatively) explained by the seed photon switch in the hot flow i.e.\nthis supports models where the X-rays are always produced by the hot flow. By\ncontrast, standard conical jet models are as radiatively inefficient as the hot\nflow so there is no transition in X-ray production mechanism with $\\dot{m}$.\nIncluding the effects of electron cooling allows the jet X-rays to drop more\nslowly with accretion rate and hence overtake the X-rays from the hot flow,\nhowever this produces a corresponding change in the radio-X-ray correlation,\nwhich is not observed. We argue that the unbroken radio-X-ray correlation down\nto quiescence rules out the jet transition model as an explanation for the\ntrend in X-ray spectral index.\n  Our favoured model is then a truncated disc with an inner, hot, radiatively\ninefficient flow which always dominates the hard X-rays, coupled to a conical\nsynchrotron jet which produces the radio emission. However, even this has\nissues at low $\\dot{m}$ as the low optical depth and high temperature of the\nflow means that the Compton spectrum is not well approximated by a power law.\nThis shows the need for a more sophisticated model for the electron\ndistribution in the hot flow. \n\n"}

One of the possible mechanism to\nproduce this emission is the bremsstrahlung model. However, previous analytical\nand numerical calculations showed that in this case the intracluster plasma had\nto be overheated very fast because suprathermal electrons emitting the HXR\nexcess lose their energy mainly by Coulomb losses, i.e., they heat the\nbackground plasma. It was concluded also from these investigations that it is\nproblematic to produce emitting electrons from a background plasma by\nstochastic (Fermi) acceleration because the energy supplied by external sources\nin the form of Fermi acceleration is quickly absorbed by the background plasma.\nIn other words the Fermi acceleration is ineffective for particle acceleration.\nWe revisited this problem and found that at some parameter of acceleration the\nrate of plasma heating is rather low and the acceleration tails of non-thermal\nparticles can be generated and exist for a long time while the plasma\ntemperature is almost constant. We showed also that for some regime of\nacceleration the plasma cools down instead of being heated up, even though\nexternal sources (in the form of external acceleration) supply energy to the\nsystem.

We compile the first comprehensive study of inferred and observed\nvalues for relevant stellar and magnetic parameters of 64 confirmed magnetic OB\nstars with Teff > 16 kK. Using these parameters, we locate the stars in the\nmagnetic confinement-rotation diagram, a log-log plot of RK vs. RA. This\ndiagram can be subdivided into regimes of centrifugal magnetospheres (CM), with\nRA > RK, vs. dynamical magnetospheres (DM), with RK > RA. We show how key\nobservational diagnostics, like the presence and characteristics of Halpha\nemission, depend on a star's position within the diagram, as well as other\nparameters, especially the expected wind mass-loss rates. In particular, we\nidentify two distinct populations of magnetic stars with Halpha emission:\nnamely, slowly rotating O-type stars with narrow emission consistent with a DM,\nand more rapidly rotating B-type stars with broader emission associated with a\nCM. For O-type stars, the high mass-loss rates are sufficient to accumulate\nenough material for line emission even within the relatively short free-fall\ntimescale associated with a DM: this high mass-loss rate also leads to a rapid\nmagnetic spindown of the stellar rotation. For the B-type stars, the longer\nconfinement of a CM is required to accumulate sufficient emitting material from\ntheir relatively weak winds, which also lead to much longer spindown\ntimescales.

The\nanalysis consists of two parts: probing the fast (~ 1 minute) X-ray spectral\nevolution with Principal Component Analysis followed by subsequent spectral\nfits to the time-averaged spectra (~ 3 ks). Based on the analysis we find that\nthe overall X-ray variability during major flaring episodes can be attributed\nto two principal components whose evolution based on spectral fits is best\nreproduced by a hybrid Comptonization component and a bremsstrahlung or\nsaturated thermal Comptonization component. The variability of the thermal\ncomponent is found to be linked to the change in the X-ray/radio spectral\nstate.

For a stellar\nmass loss rate of $4\\times10^{-8}$ \\msun per yr and wind velocity 100 \\kms, the\nbow shock will have an emission measure ($EM = n^2 vol$) at a distance\n$\\sim10^{16}$ cm, similar to that inferred from the IR emission lines. The\nionization of the dense bow shock gas is potentially provided by collisional\nionization at the shock front and cooling radiation (X-ray and UV) from the\npost shock gas. The former would predict a constant line flux as a function of\ndistance from \\sgra, while the latter will have increasing emission at lesser\ndistances. In this model, the star and its mass loss wind should survive\npericenter passage since the wind is likely launched at 0.2 AU and this is much\nless than the Roche radius at pericenter ($\\sim3$ AU for a stellar mass of\n2\\msun).

It is found\nthat the mass-radius relationship of the DM admixed neutron stars (DANSs)\ndepends sensitively on the mass of DM candidates, the amount of DM, and\ninteractions among DM candidates. The existence of DM in DANSs results in a\nspread of mass-radius relationships that cannot be interpreted with a unique\nequilibrium sequence.

Although\nthe origin of the hardening is not clearly understood, possible explanations\ninclude hardening in the cosmic-ray source spectrum, changes in the cosmic-ray\npropagation properties in the Galaxy and the effect of nearby sources. In this\ncontribution, we propose that the spectral anomaly might be an effect of\nre-acceleration of cosmic rays by weak shocks in the Galaxy. After acceleration\nby strong supernova remnant shock waves, cosmic rays undergo diffusive\npropagation through the Galaxy. During the propagation, cosmic rays may again\nencounter expanding supernova remnant shock waves, and get re-accelerated. As\nthe probability of encountering old supernova remnants is expected to be larger\nthan the young ones due to their bigger size, re-acceleration is expected to be\nproduced mainly by weaker shocks. Since weaker shocks generate a softer\nparticle spectrum, the resulting re-accelerated component will have a spectrum\nsteeper than the initial cosmic-ray source spectrum produced by strong shocks.\nFor a reasonable set of model parameters, it is shown that such re-accelerated\ncomponent can dominate the GeV energy region while the non-reaccelerated\ncomponent dominates at higher energies, explaining the observed GeV-TeV\nspectral anomaly. \n\n"}

To reveal the trigger mechanism of solar flares, we analyzed the\nspatio-temporal correlation between the detailed magnetic field structure and\nthe emission image of the Ca H line at the central part of flaring regions for\nseveral hours prior to the onset of flares. We observed in all the flare events\nthat the magnetic shear angle in the flaring regions exceeded 70 degrees, as\nwell as that characteristic magnetic disturbances developed at the centers of\nflaring regions in the pre-flare phase. These magnetic disturbances can be\nclassified into two groups depending on the structure of their magnetic\npolarity inversion lines; the so-called \"Opposite-Polarity\" and\n\"Reversed-Shear\" magnetic field recently proposed by our group, although the\nmagnetic disturbance in one event of the four samples is too subtle to clearly\nrecognize the detailed structure.

Such a remnant has been proposed as an\nexplanation for the late X-ray emission observed following some short duration\ngamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and as possible electromagnetic counterparts to the\ngravitational wave chirp. A stable NS merger remnant necessarily possesses a\nlarge rotational energy > 1e52 erg, the majority of which is ultimately\ndeposited into the surrounding circumburst medium (CBM) at mildly relativistic\nvelocities. We present Very Large Array radio observations of 7 short GRBs,\nsome of which possessed temporally extended X-ray emission, on timescales of\n~1-3 years following the initial burst. No radio sources were detected, with\ntypical upper limits ~0.3 mJy at 1.4 GHz. A basic model for the synchrotron\nemission from the blast wave is used to constrain the presence of a long-lived\nNS merger remnant in each system. Depending on the GRB, our non-detections\ntranslate into upper limits on the CBM density n < 3e-2 - 3e-3 particles/cm^3\nrequired for consistency with the remnant hypothesis. Our upper limits rule out\na long-lived remnant in GRB 050724 and 060505, but cannot rule out such a\nremnant in other systems due to their lower inferred CBM densities based on\nafterglow modeling or the lack of such constraints.

We\npresent the first evidence for an alternative conjecture: the arrows exist in\nall solutions of the gravitational law that governs the Universe and arise\nbecause the space of its true degrees of freedom (shape space) is asymmetric.\nWe prove our conjecture for arrows of complexity and information in the\nNewtonian N-body problem. Except for a set of measure zero, all of its\nsolutions for non-negative energy divide at a uniquely defined point into two\nhalves. In each a well-defined measure of complexity fluctuates but grows\nirreversibly between rising bounds from that point. Structures that store\ndynamical information are created as the complexity grows. Recognition of the\ndivision is a key novelty of our approach. Each solution can be viewed as\nhaving a single past and two distinct futures emerging from it. Any internal\nobserver must be in one half of the solution and will only be aware of one past\nand one future. The `paradox' of a time-symmetric law that leads to\nobservationally irreversible behaviour is fully resolved.

This conclusion is not correct due\nto the following facts: first, it is claimed that the linearity conditions are\nnot satisfied, but nowhere in K12 the amplitudes of the perturbations were in\nfact estimated. Therefore, without such estimates, the only possible conclusion\nfrom this work is the well known fact that the perturbations indeed grow during\ncontraction, which, per se, does not imply that the linearity conditions become\ninvalid. Second, some evaluations of the linearity conditions are incorrect\nbecause third other terms, instead of the appropriate second order ones, are\nmistakenly compared with first order terms, yielding artificially fast growing\nconditions.

In the nascent era of wide field transient\nsearches, objects with detailed observations are decreasing as a fraction of\nthe overall known SN population, and this strategy sacrifices the majority of\nthe information contained in the data about the underlying population of\ntransients. A population level modeling approach, simultaneously fitting all\navailable observations of objects in a transient sub-class of interest, fully\nmines the data to infer the properties of the population and avoids certain\nsystematic biases. We present a novel hierarchical Bayesian statistical model\nfor population level modeling of transient light curves, and discuss its\nimplementation using an efficient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo technique.

If the latter were true, then LBVs should be\nconcentrated in young clusters and found alongside main-sequence stars with\nsimilarly high inferred initial mass. This is decidedly not the case. Examining\nlocations of LBVs compared to O stars in our Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds\nreveals that LBVs systematically avoid clusters of O stars, and many reside\nover 100 pc from any O star. In the LMC, LBVs are statistically much more\nisolated than O-type stars, and (perhaps most surprisingly) even more isolated\nthan most WR stars. This makes it impossible for LBVs to be massive stars in\ntransition to WR stars. Instead, we propose that massive stars and supernova\n(SN) subtypes are dominated by bifurcated evolutionary paths in interacting\nbinaries, wherein most WR stars and SNeIbc correspond to the mass donors, while\nLBVs (and their lower-mass analogs like B[e] supergiants, which we show to be\neven more isolated) are the mass gainers.

This characteristic feature can\nbe quantified with the absorption measure distribution (AMD), defined as the\ndistribution of column density with ionization parameter |dN / dlog xi|.\nObserved AMDs extend over 0.1 < xi < 10^4 (cgs), and are remarkably similar in\ndifferent objects.

At core bounce, progenitors with rapid\ncore rotation rates exhibit a characteristic GW signal which can be used to\nconstrain the properties of the core of the progenitor star. We investigate the\ndynamics of rapidly rotating core collapse, focusing on hydrodynamic waves\ngenerated by the core bounce and the GW spectrum they produce. The centrifugal\ndistortion of the rapidly rotating proto-neutron star (PNS) leads to the\ngeneration of axisymmetric quadrupolar oscillations within the PNS and\nsurrounding envelope. Using linear perturbation theory, we estimate the\nfrequencies, amplitudes, damping times, and GW spectra of the oscillations. Our\nanalysis provides a qualitative explanation for several features of the GW\nspectrum and shows reasonable agreement with nonlinear hydrodynamic\nsimulations, although a few discrepancies due to non-linear/rotational effects\nare evident. The dominant early postbounce GW signal is produced by the\nfundamental quadrupolar oscillation mode of the PNS, at a frequency $0.70 \\,\n{\\rm kHz} \\lesssim f \\lesssim 0.80\\,{\\rm kHz}$, whose energy is largely trapped\nwithin the PNS and leaks out on a $\\sim\\!10$ ms timescale.

Because they form a relatively homogeneous\npopulation, with high stellar masses and red colors, they are expected to\noccupy halos in a relatively simple way. In this paper, we study how LRGs\noccupy massive halos via direct counts in clusters and we reveal several\nunexpected trends suggesting that the connection between LRGs and dark matter\nhalos may not be straightforward. Using the redMaPPer cluster catalog, we\nderive the central occupation of LRGs as a function richness, Ncen({\\lambda}).\nAssuming no correlation between cluster mass and central galaxy luminosity at\nfixed richness, we show that clusters contain a significantly lower fraction of\ncentral LRGs than predicted from the two-point correlation function.

Over three years of multi-band VLA\nradio observations of the 2010 nova V1723 Aql show that shocks between fast and\nslow flows within the ejecta led to the acceleration of particles and the\nproduction of synchrotron radiation. Soon after the start of the eruption,\nshocks in the ejecta produced an unexpected radio flare, resulting in a\nmulti-peaked radio light curve. The emission eventually became consistent with\nan expanding thermal remnant with mass $2 \\times 10^{-4} M_\\odot$ and\ntemperature $10^4$ K. However, during the first two months, the $\\gtrsim 10^6$\nK brightness temperature at low frequencies was too high to be due to thermal\nemission from the small amount of X-ray producing shock-heated gas. Radio\nimaging showed structures with velocities of 400 km s$^{-1}$ (d/6 kpc) in the\nplane of the sky, perpendicular to a more elongated 1500 km s$^{-1}$ (d/6 kpc)\nflow. The morpho-kinematic structure of the ejecta from V1723 Aql appears\nsimilar to nova V959 Mon, where collisions between a slow torus and a faster\nflow collimated the fast flow and gave rise to \\gamma -ray producing shocks.\nOptical spectroscopy and X-ray observations of V1723 Aql during the radio flare\nare consistent with this picture. Our observations support the idea that shocks\nin novae occur when a fast flow collides with a slow collimating torus. Such\nshocks could be responsible for hard X-ray emission, \\gamma -ray production,\nand double-peaked radio light curves from some classical novae. \n\n"}

In some cases the\nburning ashes may rise from the burning depths up to the NS photosphere by\nconvection, leading to the appearance of the metal absorption edges in the\nspectra, which then force the emergent X-ray burst spectra to shift toward\nlower energies.

Results from direct detection experiments are often analyzed assuming a\nsimple isothermal distribution of dark matter, the Standard Halo Model (SHM).\nYet there has been skepticism regarding the validity of this simple model due\nto the complicated gravitational collapse and merger history of actual\ngalaxies. In this paper we compare the SHM to the results of cosmological\nhydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation to investigate whether or not\nthe SHM is a good representation of the true WIMP distribution in the analysis\nof direct detection data. We examine two Milky Way-like galaxies from the\nMaGICC cosmological simulations (a) with dark matter only and (b) with baryonic\nphysics included.

We also note that we do not find a significant\ndisk-like rotating dark matter component in either of the two galaxy halos with\nbaryons that we examine, suggesting that dark disks are not a generic\nprediction of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations.

We have analyzed data for a representative set of extremely\nmetal-poor galaxies (XMPs), as well as auxiliary data, and compared these to\nempirical and theoretical predictions.

Considering the HI gas alone, a considerable\nfraction of the XMPs already fall off the KS law.

Here we explore the non-trivial coupling between these two\nprocesses and analyze how the global properties of externally supplied\ncircumbinary disks depend on the binary accretion rate. By formulating our\nresults in terms of the angular momentum flux driven by internal stresses, we\ncome up with a very simple classification of the possible global disk\nstructures, which differ from the standard constant $\\dot M$ accretion disk\nsolution. Suppression of accretion by the binary tides, leading to a\nsignificant mass accumulation in the inner disk, accelerates binary inspiral.\nWe show that once the disk region strongly perturbed by the viscously\ntransmitted tidal torque exceeds the binary semi-major axis, the binary can\nmerge in less than its mass-doubling time due to accretion. Thus, unlike the\ninspirals driven by stellar scattering, the gas-assisted merger can occur even\nif the binary is embedded in a relatively low mass disk (lower than its own\nmass). This is important for resolving the \"last parsec\" problem for SMBH\nbinaries and understanding powerful gravitational wave sources in the Universe.\nWe argue that the enhancement of accretion by the binary found in some recent\nsimulations cannot persist for a long time and should not affect the long-term\norbital inspiral.

We scale our simulations to some\nnearby galaxies and find that the expected boost in stellar accretion (or tidal\ndisruption, which could be observed as X-ray flares) in the presence of a gas\ndisc is about a factor of 10. Even with this boost, the accretion of mass from\nstars is still a factor of ~ 100 slower than the accretion of gas from the\ndisc.

The\ninjection of the disk wind is treated as a boundary condition in the equatorial\nplane, and its evolution is followed by invoking a prescribed geometry of\nstreamlines. Solutions are obtained for a wide range of disk wind parameters.\nIt is found that jet collimation generally occurs when the total wind power\nexceeds about ten percents of the jet power. For moderate wind powers we find\ngradual collimation. For strong winds we find rapid collimation followed by\nfocusing of the jet, after which it remains narrow over many Alfv\\'en crossing\ntimes before becoming conical. We estimate that in the later case the jet's\nmagnetic field may be dissipated by the current-driven kink instability over a\ndistance of a few hundreds gravitational radii. We apply the model to M87 and\nshow that the observed parabolic shape of the radio jet within the Bondi radius\ncan be reproduced provided that the wind injection zone extends to several\nhundreds gravitational radii, and that its total power is about one third of\nthe jet power.

In this\nreview, we summarize the most fundamental theoretical aspects of neutron star\nmagnetospheres and winds. The main competing models susceptible to explain\ntheir radiative properties like multi-wavelength pulse shapes and spectra and\nthe underlying physical processes such as pair creation and radiation\nmechanisms are scrutinized. A global but still rather qualitative picture\nemerges slowly thanks to recent advances in numerical simulations on the\nlargest scales. However considerations about pulsar magnetospheres remain\nspeculative. For instance the exact composition of the magnetospheric plasma is\nnot yet known. Is it solely filled with a mixture of $e^\\pm$~leptons, or does\nit contain a non negligible fraction of protons and/or ions? Actually, is it\nalmost entirely filled or mostly empty except for some small anecdotal plasma\nfilled regions? Answers to these questions will strongly direct the description\nof the magnetosphere to seemingly contradictory results leading sometimes to\ninconsistencies.

We quantify, for the first time,\nthe impact of magnification uncertainties on LF results and thus provide more\nrealistic constraints than other recent work. Our simulations reveal that for\nthe highly-magnified sources the systematic uncertainties can become extremely\nlarge fainter than -14 mag, reaching several orders of magnitude at 95%\nconfidence at ~-12 mag. Our new forward-modeling formalism incorporates the\nimpact of magnification uncertainties into the LF results by exploiting the\navailability of many independent magnification models for the same cluster. One\npublic magnification model is used to construct a mock high-redshift galaxy\nsample that is then analyzed using the other magnification models to construct\na LF. Large systematic errors occur at high magnifications (mu>30) because of\ndifferences between the models.

The former result is inconsistent with the simplest models of\nquasar unification that rely solely on viewing angle, while the latter may\nsupport such models. Here, using empirical relationships between dark matter\nhalo and supermassive black hole masses, we provide a simple evolutionary\npicture that naturally explains these findings and is motivated by more\nsophisticated merger-driven quasar fueling models. The model tracks the growth\nrate of haloes, with the black hole growing in spurts of quasar activity in\norder to \"catch-up\" with the $M_{\\textrm{BH}}$ - $M_{\\textrm{star}}$ -\n$M_{\\textrm{halo}}$ relationship. The first part of the quasar phase is\nobscured and is followed by an unobscured phase.

For high luminosity samples, the\ndifference can be large (a few to 10 times higher masses in obscured quasars),\nwhile for lower luminosity samples the halo mass difference is very small, much\nsmaller than current observational constraints.

The\nion-wake is shown to be a driven non-linear ion-acoustic wave in the form of a\ncylindrical ion-soliton. The near-void and radially-outwards propagating\nion-wake channel of a few plasma skin-depth radius, is explored for application\nto \"Crunch-in\" regime of positron acceleration. The coupling from the electron\nwakefield mode to the ion-mode dictates the long-term evolution of the plasma\nand the time for its relaxation back to an equilibrium, limiting the\nrepetition-rate of a plasma accelerator. Using an analytical model it is shown\nthat it is the time asymmetric phases of the oscillating radial electric fields\nof the nearly-stationary electron bubble that excite time-averaged inertial ion\nmotion radially.

Any model attempting to explain these\nrebrightenings should thus be able to reproduce the different outburst profiles\nof the source at different times. Surprisingly, our Swift/XRT observations were\nunable to detect the source, contrary to previous Swift/XRT observations in\nquiescence.

Because the Alfv\\'en speed\nvaries with distance from the disk, the AWs undergo partial non-WKB reflection,\nand counter-propagating AWs subsequently interact, causing AW energy to cascade\nto small scales and dissipate. To investigate this process, we introduce an\nElsasser-like formulation of general relativistic MHD (GRMHD) and develop the\ntheory of general relativistic reduced MHD in an inhomogeneous medium. We then\nderive a set of equations for the mean-square AW amplitude $M_+$ and turbulent\nheating rate $Q$ under the assumption that, in the plasma rest frame, AWs\npropagating away from the disk are much more energetic than AWs propagating\ntoward the disk. For the case in which the background flow is axisymmetric and\ntime-independent, we solve these equations analytically to determine $M_+$ and\n$Q$ as functions of position. We find that, for an idealized thin disk threaded\nby a large-scale poloidal magnetic field, the AW energy flux is $\\sim\n(\\rho_{\\rm b}/\\rho_{\\rm d})^{1/2} \\beta_{\\rm net,d}^{-1/2}$ times the disk's\nradiative flux, where $\\rho_{\\rm b}$ and $\\rho_{\\rm d}$ are the mass densities\nat the coronal base and disk midplane, respectively, and $\\beta_{\\rm net,d}$ is\nthe ratio (evaluated at the disk midplane) of plasma-plus-radiation pressure to\nthe pressure of the average vertical magnetic field.

The fact that disc galaxies are ubiquitous in the local Universe\nsuggests that a quiescent history is not necessary for their formation. Modern\ncosmological simulations can now obtain relatively realistic populations of\ndisc galaxies, but it still remains to be clarified how discs manage to survive\nmassive mergers. Here we use a suite of high-resolution hydrodynamical\nsimulations set in a LambdaCDM cosmology to elucidate the fate of discs\nencountering massive mergers. We extract a sample of approximately 100 disc\ngalaxies and follow the changes in their post-merger morphologies, as tracked\nby their disc-to-total ratios (D/T). We also examine the relations between\ntheir present-day morphology, assembly history and gas fractions. We find that\napproximately half of present-day disc galaxies underwent at least one merger\nwith a satellite of total mass exceeding the host system's stellar mass, a\nthird had mergers with satellites of mass exceeding 3 times the host's stellar\nmass, and approximately one-sixth had mergers with satellites of mass exceeding\n10 times of the host's stellar mass. These mergers lead to a sharp, but often\ntemporary, decrease in the D/T of the hosts, implying that discs are usually\ndisrupted but then quickly re-grow. To do so, high cold gas fractions are\nrequired post-merger, as well as a relatively quiescent recent history (over a\nfew Gyrs before z=0). Our results show that discs can form via diverse merger\npathways and that quiescent histories are not the dominant mode of disc\nformation. \n\n"}

This is because thermal radiation is normally observed in the\nsoft X-ray band, and it is thought to be linearly polarized because of\ndifferent opacities for two polarization modes of photons in the magnetized\natmosphere of neutron stars and the dielectric properties of the vacuum in\nstrong magnetic fields. In their previous study, Taverna et al. illustrated how\nstrong magnetic fields influence the behavior of the polarization observables\nfor radiation propagating in vacuo without addressing a precise, physical\nemission model.

Free-free\nabsorption is affected by the mass, geometry, temperature, and ionisation\nconditions in the absorbing gas. Observations at the lowest radio frequencies\nconstrain a combination of these properties. We use LOFAR LBA observations at\n30-77 MHz and L-band VLA observations to compare $u-v$-matched images with a\ncommon resolution of 17\".

The\nfrequencies can be offset from the spin frequency of the NS by several Hz, and\ncan drift by 1-3 Hz. One possible explanation is a mode in the bursting ocean,\nthe frequency of which would decrease (in the rotating frame) as the burst\ncools, hence explaining the drifts. Most burst oscillations have been observed\nduring H/He triggered bursts, however there has been one observation of\noscillations during a superburst; hours' long Type I X-ray bursts caused by\nunstable carbon burning deeper in the ocean. This paper calculates the\nfrequency evolution of an oceanic r-mode during a superburst.

Our results predict powerful soft X-ray or extreme\nultraviolet emission from the hot inner region of the high accretion rate disk.\nUsing constraining X-ray observations and assuming the accretion disk doesn't\ndepart too much from the standard model, we are left with two possible\nscenarios. The disk either emits mainly extreme ultraviolet radiation which, at\na distance of a few kpc, is completely absorbed by the interstellar medium, or\nthe hot inner disk, emitting soft X-rays, is masked by the bulging disk seen at\na higher inclination. \n\n"}

Such obliquities may reveal clues about hot Jupiter\ndynamical histories. Common explanations for generating obliquities include\nhigh-eccentricity migration and primordial disk misalignment. This paper\ninvestigates another mechanism for producing stellar spin-orbit misalignments\nin systems hosting a close-in planet with an external, modestly inclined\ncompanion. Spin-orbit misalignment may be excited due to a secular resonance,\noccurring when the precession rate of the stellar spin axis (driven by the\ninner planet) becomes comparable to the nodal precession rate of the inner\nplanet (driven by the companion). Due to the spin-down of the host star via\nmagnetic braking, this resonance may be achieved during the star's\nmain-sequence lifetime for a wide range of planet masses and orbital\narchitectures. Obliquity excitation is accompanied by a decrease in mutual\ninclination between the inner planet and perturber, and can thus erase high\ninclinations. For hot Jupiters, the stellar spin axis is strongly coupled to\nthe orbital axis, and obliquity excitation by a giant planet companion requires\na strong perturber, usually located within 1-2 AU. For warm Jupiters, the spin\nand orbital axes are more weakly coupled, and the resonance may be achieved for\ndistant giant planet perturbers (at several to tens of AU). Since warm Jupiters\nhave a high occurrence rate of distant planetary companions with appropriate\nproperties for resonant obliquity excitation, stellar obliquities in warm\nJupiter systems may be common, particularly for warm Jupiters orbiting cool\nstars that have undergone significant spin-down. \n\n"}

Abstract: Molecular gas in Arches cloud located near the Arches cluster is one of the\nemitters of K-$\\alpha$ line of neutral iron and X-ray continuum in the Galactic\ncenter (GC). Similarly to the cloud Sgr B2, another well-known emitter of the\niron line in the GC, the Arches cloud demonstrates temporal decline of the\nX-ray emission. The most natural origin of this emission is irradiation of\nprimary photons of an X-ray flare from a distant source, most likely Sgr A*.\nHowever, recent observations of the Arches cloud discovered variations of\nequivalent width of the 6.4 keV iron line, which indicated that the X-ray\nemission from the cloud is a combination of two components with different\norigin and different equivalent width, one of which is time-variable, while the\nother is stationary during the period of observations. We considered two\ndifferent scenarios: a) this emission is formed by reflection from two clouds,\nwhich are at some distance from each other, when they are irradiated by two\ndifferent flares; and b) the other scenario assumes a combination of X-ray\nfluxes produced in the same cloud by reflection of primary photons and by\nsubrelativistic cosmic rays.

Tipler showed that this CBR\nproperty would also mean the Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR) would\npropagate a factor of ten further than standard theory predicts, since most of\nthe cross section for pion production when a UHECR hits a CBR photon is due to\na quark spin flip, and such a flip cannot occur if a CBR particle cannot couple\nto right-handed quarks. We show that taking this additional propagation\ndistance into account allows us to identify the sources of 86\\% of the UHECR\nseen by the Pierre Auger Collaboration. We can also identify the sources of 9\nof the 11 UHECR seen by the AGASA observatory, and the source of the 320 EeV\nUHECR seen by the Fly's Eye instrument.

Such a scenario could explain the formation of the new population of\nmassive black holes detected by the LIGO/VIRGO gravitational wave laser\ninterferometers. We probe that scenario by performing general relativistic\nmagnetohydrodynamic simulations of differentially rotating massive stars\nsupported by thermal radiation pressure plus a gas pressure perturbation. The\nstars are initially threaded by a dynamically weak, poloidal magnetic field\nconfined to the stellar interior. We find that magnetic braking and turbulent\nviscous damping via magnetic winding and the magnetorotational instability in\nthe bulk of the star redistribute angular momentum, damp differential rotation\nand induce the formation of a massive and nearly uniformly rotating inner core\nsurrounded by a Keplerian envelope. The core + disk configuration evolves on a\nsecular timescale and remains in quasi-stationary equilibrium until the\ntermination of our simulations. Our results suggest that the high degree of\ndifferential rotation required for $m=2$ seed density perturbations to trigger\ngas fragmentation and binary black hole formation is likely to be suppressed\nduring the normal lifetime of the star prior to evolving to the point of\ndynamical instability to collapse. Other cataclysmic events, such as stellar\nmergers leading to collapse, may therefore be necessary to reestablish\nsufficient differential rotation and density perturbations to drive\nnonaxisymmetric modes leading to binary black hole formation. \n\n"}

The data indicate that the hard X-ray tail, observed previously,\nthat extends to energies above 100 keV does not originate in localised regions,\nlike the bright X-ray knots and filaments or the primary blast wave, but is\nspread over the whole remnant with a rather flat hardness ratio of the 8-10 and\n10-15 keV energy bands. This result does not support an interpretation of the\nhard X-radiation as synchrotron emission produced in the primary shock, in\nwhich case a limb brightened shell of hard X-ray emission close to the primary\nshock front is expected. In fact a weak rim of emission near the primary shock\nfront is discernable in the hardest X-ray image but it contains only a few\npercent of the hard X-ray emissivity. The equivalent width of the Fe-K line\nblend varies by more than an order of magnitude over the remnant, it is hard to\nexplain this as Fe-emission from the reverse shock heated ejecta given the\nejecta temperature and the age of the remnant.

We pose the importance to seek the physically natural\nenvironment around GRB000214. For the reproduction of the observation, we need\nthe ring-like remnant around the progenitor like that of SN 1987A produced by\nthe mass-loss of the progenitor and the fireball spread over in every\ndirections. The observation of GRB000214, in which the continuum power law\nspectrum decreased faster than the line, motivated us to consider the two\nindependent systems for the line emission and the continuum spectrum. At first,\nthe continuum spectrum can be fitted by the afterglow emission of the fireball\npointing toward the observer which does not collide with the ring because the\nemission of GRB and the afterglow are highly collimated to the observer by the\nrelativistic beaming effect. Secondly, the line can be fitted by the\nfluorescence of the Fe atoms in the ring illuminated by the X-ray afterglow.\nThe significance of this study is that our model may constrain strongly the GRB\nmodel. Although the Supranova model assumes the extreme-ring-like remnant\nproduced by the usual supernova explosion, this may not be probable.

Our goal is to\ndetermine the sensitivity of the properties of the resulting stars and brown\ndwarfs to variations in the initial conditions imposed. In this paper we report\non the results obtained by applying two different initial turbulent velocity\nfields. The slope of the turbulent power-law spectrum alpha is set to -3 in\nhalf of the calculations and to -5 in the other half. We find that, whereas the\nstellar mass function seems to only be weakly dependent on the value of alpha,\nthe sub-stellar mass function turns out to be more sensitive to the initial\nslope of the velocity field. We argue that, since the role of turbulence is to\ncreate substructure from which gravitational instabilities may grow, variations\nin other initial conditions that also determine the fragmentation process are\nlikely to affect the shape of the sub-stellar mass function as well. The\nabsence of many planetary mass `free-floaters' in our simulations, especially\nin the mass range 1-10 MJ, suggests that, if these objects are abundant, they\nare likely to form by similar mechanisms to those thought to operate in\nquiescent accretion discs, instead of via instabilities in gravitationally\nunstable discs. Finally, we find that multiple and single stars share\ncomparable kinematical properties, both populations being able to attain\nvelocities in the range 1-10 km/s. From these values we draw the conclusion\nthat only low-mass star-forming regions such as Taurus-Auriga or Ophiuchus,\nwhere the escape speed is low, might have suffered some depletion of its single\nand binary stellar population. \n\n"}

Under\ndisturbance, the constants are endowed with time dependence. The Lagrange\nconstraint is then imposed to guarantee that the functional dependence of the\nperturbed velocity on the time and constants stays the same as in the\nundisturbed case. Constants obeying this condition are called osculating\nelements. The constants chosen to be canonical are called Delaunay elements, in\nthe orbital case, or Andoyer elements, in the spin case. (As some Andoyer\nelements are time dependent even in the free-spin case, the role of constants\nis played by their initial values.) The Andoyer and Delaunay sets of elements\nshare a feature not readily apparent: in certain cases the standard equations\nrender them non-osculating. In orbital mechanics, elements furnished by the\nstandard planetary equations are non-osculating when perturbations depend on\nvelocities. To preserve osculation, the equations must be amended with extra\nterms that are not parts of the disturbing function. In the case of Delaunay\nparameterisation, these terms destroy canonicity. So under velocity-dependent\ndisturbances, osculation and canonicity are incompatible. (Efroimsky and\nGoldreich 2003, 2004) Similarly, the Andoyer elements turn out to be\nnon-osculating under angular-velocity-dependent perturbation. Amendment of only\nthe Hamiltonian makes the equations render nonosculating elements. To make them\nosculating, more terms must enter the equations (and the equations will no\nlonger be canonical). In practical calculations, is often convenient to\ndeliberately deviate from osculation by substituting the Lagrange constraint\nwith a condition that gives birth to a family of nonosculating elements. \n\n"}

Previous NS atmosphere models incorporated this effect\napproximately, using transfer equations for the photon modes which are\ninadequate near the vacuum resonance, particularly for field strengths around\n$B_l\\simeq 7\\times 10^{13}$ G, where the vacuum resonance occurs near the\nphotosphere. In this paper, we provide an accurate treatment of the QED-induced\nmode conversion effect in NS atmosphere models, employing both the modal\nradiative transfer equations, coupled with an accurate mode conversion\nprobability at the resonance, and the full evolution equations for the photon\nStokes parameters. In doing so, we are able to quantitatively calculate the\neffects of vacuum polarization on the atmosphere emission spectra, beam\npatterns, and polarizations for the entire range of field strengths,\n$B=10^{12}-10^{15}$ G.

The chi^2 distribution between the real\nand simulated data as a function of the percentage polarisation and\npolarisation angle was calculated for all three energy ranges. The degree of\nlinear polarisation in the brightest pulse of duration 66s was found to be\n63+/-31% at an angle of 70+/-14 degrees in the 100-350keV energy range. The\ndegree of polarisation was also constrained in the brightest 12s of the GRB and\na polarisation fraction of 96+/-40% at an angle of 60+/-14 degrees was\ndetermined over the same energy range. However, despite extensive analysis and\nsimulations, a systematic effect that could mimic the weak polarisation signal\ncould not be definitively excluded. Our results over several energy ranges and\ntime intervals are consistent with a polarisation signal of about 60% at a low\nlevel of significance (2 sigma).

We find\nthat the disk's ability to produce strong magnetic flares is substantially\ndiminished in its radiation dominated regions due to the diffusion of radiation\ninto the magnetic flux tubes. Using a simplified, yet physically\nself-consistent, model that takes this effect into account, we show that the\nhard X-ray spectrum of some GBHCs can be explained as the X-ray emission by\nmagnetic flares only when the disk's bolometric luminosity is a relatively\nsmall fraction ($\\sim$ 5%) of the Eddington value, $L_{Edd}$.

This\nfeature is made of stars just massive enough for having ignited helium in\nnon-degenerate conditions. In this paper, we go into more details about the\norigin and properties of this feature. We first compare the clump theoretical\nmodels with data for clusters of different ages and metallicities, basically\nconfirming the predicted behaviours. We then refine the previous models in\norder to show that: (i) The faint extension is expected to be clearly separated\nfrom the main clump in the CMD of metal-rich populations, defining a secondary\nclump by itself. (ii) It should be present in all galactic fields containing ~1\nGyr old stars and with mean metallicities higher than about Z=0.004. (iii) It\nshould be particularly strong, if compared to the main red clump, in galaxies\nwhich have increased their star formation rate in the last Gyr or so of their\nevolution. In fact, secondary clumps similar to the model predictions are\nobserved in the CMD of nearby stars from Hipparcos data, and in those of some\nLMC fields observed to date. There are also several reasons why this secondary\nclump may be missing or hidden in other observed CMDs of galaxy fields (e.g.\nphotometric errors or differential absorption larger than 0.2 mag).\nNonetheless, this structure may provide important constraints to the star\nformation history of Local Group galaxies.

Both the HST and\nKeck images show that the optical transient (OT) is clearly offset by 0.6\narcsec from an extended object, presumably the host galaxy. This galaxy is the\nmost likely source of the metallic-line absorption at z = 1.6004 seen in the\nspectrum of the OT. With magnitudes V_{C} ~ 24.6 +/- 0.2 and K = 21.65 +/- 0.30\nmag this corresponds to an L ~ 0.7 L_* galaxy, assuming that it is located at z\n= 1.6. The estimated unobscured star formation rate is SFR ~ 6 M_sun/yr, which\nis not unusually high for normal galaxies at comparable redshifts. The strength\nof the observed metallic absorption lines is suggestive of a relatively high\nmetallicity of the gas, and thus of a chemically evolved system which may be\nassociated with a massive galaxy. It is also indicative of a high column\ndensity of the gas, typical of damped Ly-alpha systems at high redshifts. We\nconclude that this is the host galaxy of GRB 990123.

The size of this tidal feature necessitates an old interaction age for the\nmerger (~750 Myr since first periapse), which is currently experiencing a very\nyoung star burst (~20 Myr).

We study in detail the dynamics of the curvaton evolution during and\nafter inflation. We consider that the flatness of the curvaton potential may be\naffected by supergravity corrections, which introduce an effective mass\nproportional to the Hubble parameter. We also consider that the curvaton\npotential may be dominated by a quartic or by a non-renormalizable term. We\nfind analytic solutions for the curvaton's evolution for all these\npossibilities. In particular, we show that, in all the above cases, the\ncurvaton's density ratio with respect to the background density of the Universe\ndecreases. Therefore, it is necessary that the curvaton decays only after its\npotential becomes dominated by the quadratic term, which results in (Hubble\ndamped) sinusoidal oscillations. In the case when a non-renormalizable term\ndominates the potential, we find a possible non-oscillatory attractor solution\nthat threatens to erase the curvature perturbation spectrum. Finally, we study\nthe effects of thermal corrections to the curvaton's potential and show that,\nif they ever dominate the effective mass, they lead to premature thermalization\nof the curvaton condensate.

Using a hybrid-type potential we obtain a two-stage\ninflationary model. Depending on the curvature of the potential the first stage\ncorresponds to a period of fast-roll inflation or a period of `locked'\ninflation, induced by an oscillating inflaton. This is followed by a second\nstage of fast-roll inflation. We demonstrate that these two consecutive\ninflationary phases result in enough total e-foldings to encompass the\ncosmological scales. Using natural values for the parameters (masses of order\nTeV and vacuum energy of the intermediate scale corresponding to gravity\nmediated supersymmetry breaking) we conclude that the $\\eta$-problem of\ninflation is easily overcome.

It is shown\nthat Israel's junction conditions across the brane restrict severely the\ndependence of the matter fields on the spacetime coordinates. As examples, a\nscalar field or a Yang-Mills potential can be only either time-dependent or\nradial-coordinate dependent for the chosen gauge, while for a perfect fluid it\nmust be co-moving. \n\n"}
{"id": "hep-th/0602276", "contents": "Title: Cosmic Strings Abstract: Cosmic strings, a hot subject in the 1980's and early 1990's, lost its appeal\nwhen it was found that it leads to inconsistencies in the power spectrum of the\nmeasured cosmic microwave background temperature anisotropies. However,\ntopological defects in general, and cosmic strings in particular, are deeply\nrooted in the framework of grand unified theories. Indeed, it was shown that\ncosmic strings are expected to be generically formed within supersymmetric\ngrand unified theories. This theoretical support gave a new boost to the field\nof cosmic strings, a boost which has been recently enhanced when it was shown\nthat cosmic superstrings (fundamental or one-dimensional Dirichlet branes) can\nplay the role of cosmic strings, in the framework of braneworld cosmologies.\n  To build a cosmological scenario we employ high energy physics; inflation and\ncosmic strings then naturally appear. Confronting the predictions of the\ncosmological scenario against current astrophysical/cosmological data we impose\nconstraints on its free parameters, obtaining information about the high energy\nphysics we employed.\n  This is a beautiful example of the rich and fruitful interplay between\ncosmology and high energy physics. \n\n"}

We discuss a particular form of $\\kappa$-Minkowski phase space\nalgebra that yields the $\\kappa$-extended finite Lorentz transformations\nderived in \\cite{kim}. This is a particular form of a Deformed Special\nRelativity model that admits a modified energy-momentum dispersion law as well\nas noncommutative $\\kappa$-Minkowski phase space. We show that this system can\nbe completely mapped to a set of phase space variables that obey canonical (and\n{\\it{not}} $\\kappa$-Minkowski) phase space algebra and Special Relativity\nLorentz transformation (and {\\it{not}} $\\kappa$-extended Lorentz\ntransformation). The complete set of deformed symmetry generators are\nconstructed that obeys an unmodified closed algebra but induce deformations in\nthe symmetry transformations of the physical $\\kappa$-Minkowski phase space\nvariables. Furthermore, we demonstrate the usefulness and simplicity of this\napproach through a number of phenomenological applications both in classical\nand quantum mechanics. We also construct a Lagrangian for the\n$\\kappa$-particle. \n\n"}

Available terrestrial laboratory data on the isospin diffusion in\nheavy-ion reactions at intermediate energies constrain the slope of the\nsymmetry energy.
