We\nfind a good correspondence of our results with the Fleck (1996) model of\ncompressible hydrodynamic turbulence. In particular, we find that the\ndensity-weighted velocity, i.e. $u \\equiv \\rho^{1/3} v$, proposed in Kritsuk et\nal. (2007) obeys the Kolmogorov scaling, i.e. $E_{u}(k)\\sim k^{-5/3}$ for the\nhigh Mach number turbulence. Similarly, we find that the exponents of the third\norder structure functions for $u$ stay equal to unity for the all the Mach\nnumbers studied. The scaling of higher order correlations obeys the She-Leveque\n(1994) scalings corresponding to the two-dimensional dissipative structures,\nand this result does not change with the Mach number either. In contrast to $v$\nwhich exhibits different scaling parallel and perpendicular to the local\nmagnetic field, the scaling of $u$ is similar in both directions.

The most striking feature is a long tail of\nemission, which consists of a plume ~ 4' north of M86 and two main extensions\nemanating from the plume. Based on the morphology and temperature structure of\nthe tail, we conclude that it is formed by ram pressure stripping of M86 as it\nfalls into the Virgo cluster and interacts with the Virgo ICM, in agreement\nwith earlier work. The tail is 150 kpc in projection, and a simple estimate\ngives a lower limit on the true length of the tail of 380 kpc, making this the\nlongest ram pressure stripped tail presently known. The total gas mass in the\nplume (7x10^8 M_sun) and tail (1x10^9 M_sun) is about three times that in the\ncore of M86, which supports the scenario where most of the gas was stripped\nrapidly and recently.

For quasicircular, inspiralling binaries, the\nChristodoulou memory produces a growing, nonoscillatory change in the\ngravitational-wave \"plus\" polarization, resulting in the permanent displacement\nof a pair of freely-falling test masses after the wave has passed. In addition\nto its nonoscillatory behavior, the Christodoulou memory is interesting because\neven though it originates from 2.5 post-Newtonian (PN) order multipole\ninteractions, it affects the waveform at leading (Newtonian/quadrupole) order.\nThe memory is also potentially detectable in binary black-hole mergers. While\nthe oscillatory pieces of the gravitational-wave polarizations for\nquasicircular, inspiralling compact binaries have been computed to 3PN order,\nthe memory contribution to the polarizations has only been calculated to\nleading order (the next-to-leading order 0.5PN term has previously been shown\nto vanish). Here the calculation of the memory for quasicircular, inspiralling\nbinaries is extended to 3PN order. While the angular dependence of the memory\nremains qualitatively unchanged, the PN correction terms tend to reduce the\nmemory's magnitude. Explicit expressions are given for the memory contributions\nto the plus polarization and the spin-weighted spherical-harmonic modes of the\nmetric and curvature perturbations. Combined with the recent results of\nBlanchet et al.(2008), this completes the waveform to 3PN order. This paper\nalso discusses: (i) the difficulties in extracting the memory from numerical\nsimulations, (ii) other nonoscillatory effects that enter the waveform at high\nPN orders, and (iii) issues concerning the observability of the memory. \n\n"}

A suitably\ncovariant infinite-component localization is displayed, reflecting Bergmann's\nrealization that there are infinitely many conserved gravitational\nenergy-momenta. Initially use is made of a flat background metric (or rather,\nall of them) or connection, because the desired gauge invariance properties are\nobvious. Partial gauge-fixing then yields an appropriate covariant quantity\nwithout any background metric or connection; one version is the collection of\npseudotensors of a given type, such as the Einstein pseudotensor, in_every_\ncoordinate system. This solution to the gauge covariance problem is easily\nadapted to any pseudotensorial expression (Landau-Lifshitz, Goldberg,\nPapapetrou or the like) or to any tensorial expression built with a background\nmetric or connection.

At the early stages of the universe history, the dark fluid is\nseen to give rise to a deceleration of its expansion. For t close to present\ntime it works as an additional contribution to the effective cosmological\nconstant and, later, it produces the transition to a phantom era, which could\nactually be taking place right now in some regions of the cosmos, and might\nhave observable consequences. For t close to the Rip time, the universe becomes\ncompletely dominated by the dark fluid, whose equation of state is phantom-like\nat that time. Our model, which is able to reproduce the dark energy period\nquite precisely, may still be modified in such a way that the epoch dominated\nby an effective cosmological constant, produced by the F (R) term and by the\ndark fluid contribution, becomes significantly shorter, what happens when a\nmatter term is included.

It is also seen explicitly that an F (R) theory can be\nconstructed from a phantom model in a scalar-tensor theory, in which the scalar\nfield does not behave as phantom (in the latter case the action for F (R) would\nbe complex).

The amplitude of\nCMB convergence in a given direction measures the projected surface density of\nmatter. Measurements of QSO flux decrements trace the small-scale distribution\nof gas along a given line-of-sight. While the cross-correlation between these\ntwo measurements is small for a single line-of-sight, upcoming large surveys\nshould enable its detection. This paper presents analytical estimates for the\nsignal to noise (S/N) for measurements of the cross-correlation between the\nflux decrement and the convergence and for measurements of the\ncross-correlation between the variance in flux decrement and the convergence.\nFor the ongoing BOSS (SDSS III) and Planck surveys, we estimate an S/N of 30\nand 9.6 for these two correlations.

It is commonly assumed that self-similarity is approached since\nin the $R\\to\\infty(0)$ limit the flow becomes independent of any characteristic\nlength or time scales. In this case the flow fields $f(r,t)$ must be of the\nform $f(r,t)=t^{\\alpha_f}F(r/R)$ with $R\\propto(\\pm t)^\\alpha$.

Wald on geodesic motion in general relativity\ncan be generalized to classical field theories of a metric and other tensor\nfields on four-dimensional spacetime that 1) are second-order and 2) follow\nfrom a diffeomorphism-covariant Lagrangian. The approach is to consider a\none-parameter-family of solutions to the field equations satisfying certain\nassumptions designed to reflect the existence of a body whose size, mass, and\nvarious charges are simultaneously scaled to zero. (That such solutions exist\nplaces a further restriction on the class of theories to which our results\napply.) Assumptions are made only on the spacetime region outside of the body,\nso that the results apply to ordinary bodies as well as black holes. The\nworldline \"left behind\" by the shrinking, disappearing body is interpreted as\nits lowest-order motion. An equation for this worldline follows from the\n\"Bianchi identity\" for the theory, without use of any properties of the field\nequations beyond their being second-order. The form of the force law for a\ntheory therefore depends only on the ranks of its various tensor fields, with\nthe field equations relevant only for determining the charges of a particular\nbody from its exterior fields.

The larger identification rate has increased the impact factor of\noptical observations in the multi-wavelength approach to INS astronomy, opening\ninteresting possibilities for studies not yet possible at other wavelengths.\nWith the HST on the way to its retirement, 8m class telescopes will have the\ntask of bridging neutron star optical astronomy into a new era, characterised\nby the advent of the generation of extremely large telescopes (ELTs), like the\nEuropean ELT (E-ELT).

In\nrecent years there has been considerable controversy on this issue. In\nparticular, for a quadratic potential, Kofman, Linde and Mukhanov have argued\nthat the probability of inflation with at least 65 e-foldings is close to one,\nwhile Gibbons and Turok have argued that this probability is suppressed by a\nfactor of ~ $\\10^{-85}$. We first clarify that such dramatically different\npredictions can arise because the required measure on the space of solutions is\nintrinsically ambiguous in general relativity. We then show that this ambiguity\ncan be naturally resolved in loop quantum cosmology (LQC) because the big bang\nis replaced by a big bounce and the bounce surface can be used to introduce the\nstructure necessary to specify a satisfactory measure.\n  The second goal of the paper is to present a detailed analysis of the\ninflationary dynamics of LQC using analytical and numerical methods.

They are\nan approach that, by preserving the undoubtedly positive results of Einstein's\nTheory, is aimed to address conceptual and experimental problems recently\nemerged in Astrophysics, Cosmology and High Energy Physics. In particular, the\ngoal is to encompass, in a self-consistent scheme, problems like Inflation,\nDark Energy, Dark Matter, Large Scale Structure and, first of all, to give at\nleast an effective description of Quantum Gravity. We review the basic\nprinciples that any gravitational theory has to follow. The geometrical\ninterpretation is discussed in a broad perspective in order to highlight the\nbasic assumptions of General Relativity and its possible extensions in the\ngeneral framework of gauge theories. Principles of such modifications are\npresented, focusing on specific classes of theories like f (R)-gravity and\nscalar-tensor gravity in the metric and Palatini approaches.

In this paper, we suggest the use of\neasy-to-build emulators to provide a hands-on experience for the students to\nlearn the fundamental properties and realize several applications of these\nmemelements. We provide explicit examples of problems that could be tackled\nwith these emulators that range in difficulty from the demonstration of the\nbasic properties of memristive, memcapacitive, and meminductive systems to\nlogic/computation and cross-bar memory. The emulators can be built from\noff-the-shelf components, with a total cost of a few tens of dollars, thus\nproviding a relatively inexpensive platform for the implementation of these\nexercises in the classroom.

The\nexistence of these new operators can lead to interesting dynamics for the\nevolution of the universe, including the appearance of new vacuum states. If\nthe universe today exists in a false vacuum, there will be a non-zero\nprobability to tunnel to the true vacuum state of the universe. Should this\ntransition occur elsewhere in the universe, bubbles of true vacuum will\nnucleate and expand outwards. Bubbles that nucleate in the hot dense plasma of\nthe early universe will feel a friction from the plasma that acts against the\nexpansion of the bubble, until the bubble eventually reaches a steady state\nexpansion. Unlike many bubble formation scenarios where the bubble wall\nvelocity rapidly approaches the speed of light, friction from the hot\nprimordial plasma can cause the expanding bubble wall to reach a terminal\nvelocity while gravity waves are free to propagate through the hot dense plasma\nat the speed of light. We analyze the effects of friction on the spectrum of\ngravity waves caused by bubble collisions.

In the Euclidean approach, we introduce the\nground state wave function which is approximated by instantons. We used a\nnumerical technique to find instantons that satisfy classicality. In the\nstochastic approach, we introduce the probability distribution of Hubble\npatches that can be approximated by locally homogeneous universes down to a\nsmoothing scale. We assume that the ground state wave function should\ncorrespond to the stationary state of the probability distribution of the\nstochastic universe.

(2) The size of the universe of the\nEuclidean approach corresponds to the smoothing scale of the stochastic side;\nthe universe is homogeneous up to the Euclidean instanton.

Additional information contained\nin the electromagnetic signal, such as the sky location or distance to the\nsource, can help rule out false alarms, and thus lower the necessary threshold\nfor a detection.

Vacuum and non-vacuum solutions for\n  massive gravity Abstract: Massive gravity is a theory which has a tremendous amount of freedom to\ndescribe different cosmologies; but at the same time the various solutions one\nencounters must fulfill some rather nontrivial constraints. Most of the freedom\ncomes not from the Lagrangian, which contains only a small number of free\nparameters (typically 3 depending on counting conventions), but from the fact\nthat one is in principle free to choose the background reference metric almost\narbitrarily --- which effectively introduces a non-denumerable infinity of free\nparameters. In the current paper we stress that although changing the reference\nmetric would lead to a different cosmological model, this does not mean that\nthe dynamics of the universe can be entirely divorced from its matter content.\nThat is, while the choice of reference metric certainly influences the\nevolution of the physically observable foreground metric, the effect of matter\ncannot be neglected. Nevertheless, the relation between matter and geometry can\nbe significantly changed in some specific models; effectively since the\ngraviton would be able to curve the spacetime by itself, without the need of\nmatter. Thus, even the set of vacuum solutions for massive gravity can have\nsignificant structure.

We begin by\nintroducing the concept of holographically conjugate variables (HCVs) in terms\nof which the surface term in the action has a specific relationship with the\nbulk term. In addition to g_{ab} and its conjugate momentum \\sqrt{-g} M^{cab},\nthis procedure allows us to (re)discover and motivate strongly the use of\nf^{ab}=\\sqrt{-g}g^{ab} and its conjugate momentum N^c_{ab}. The gravitational\naction can then be interpreted as a momentum space action for these variables.\nWe also show that many expressions in classical gravity simplify considerably\nin this approach. For example, the field equations can be written in a form\nanalogous to Hamilton's equations for a suitable Hamiltonian if we use these\nvariables. More importantly, the variation of the surface term, evaluated on\nany null surface which acts a local Rindler horizon can be given a direct\nthermodynamic interpretation. The term involving the variation of the dynamical\nvariable leads to T\\delta S while the term involving the variation of the\nconjugate momentum leads to S\\delta T.

In a series of papers, together with collaborators, we naturally\ninterpreted BH quasi-normal modes (QNMs) in terms of quantum levels discussing\na model of excited BH somewhat similar to the historical semi-classical Bohr\nmodel of the structure of a hydrogen atom.

A stochastic\nbackground of GWs from the incoherent superposition of many inspiraling\nsupermassive black hole binaries at nHz frequencies is likely to be the\ndominant GW signal detectable by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). Even though one\nmight expect a background composed of a high-redshift cosmological population\nof sources to be fairly isotropic, deviations from isotropy may be indicative\nof local GW hotspots or some form of continuous anisotropy in the\nangular-distribution of GW-power. A GWB induces time-of-arrival deviations in\npulsar signals which are correlated between separated pulsars. In an isotropic\nbackground this cross-correlation follows a distinctive relationship, known as\nthe Hellings and Downs curve, that depends only on the angular separation of\nthe pulsars. If the background is anisotropic, the cross-correlation is\ndifferent, but predictable, and also depends on the absolute position of the\npulsars. By simulating datasets containing GWBs with various anisotropic\nconfigurations, we have explored the prospects for constraining anisotropy\nusing near future data.

We present the most precise\nbackground estimates to date, all handled in full three dimensions, as\nfunctions of depth and geographical location. For the present calculations, we\nconsider a hypothetical 138 kiloton detector which can be transported to an\nocean site and deployed to an operational depth. We present a Bayesian\nestimation framework to incorporate any a priori knowledge of the reactor that\nwe are trying to detect, as well as the estimated uncertainty in the background\nand the oscillation parameters. Most importantly, we fully employ the knowledge\nof the reactor spectrum and the distance-dependent effects of neutrino\noscillations on such spectra. The latter, in particular, makes possible\ndetermination of range from one location, given adequate signal statistics.\nFurther, we explore the rich potential of improving detection with even modest\nimprovements in individual neutrino direction determination.

The use of an optimal variable that includes the full 5D\nprobability density function is found to improve the precision of the\nmeasurement of P of a factor of approximately 2.\n  We then study the dilution of the asymmetry that parametrize the degradation\nof the precision due to experimental effects such as multiple scattering.

We first review these ingredients -three basic\ninequalities- and discuss their relationships with the nature of fundamental\nconstants. In particular, we argue for a covariant mass bound conjecture: in a\nspacetime free of horizon, the mass inside a surface $A$ cannot exceed $16 \\pi\nG^2 m^2< A $, while the reverse holds in a spacetime with horizons. This is\ngiven a precise definition using the formalism of light-sheets. We show that\n$\\hbar/c$ may be also given a geometrical interpretation, namely $4 \\pi\n\\hbar^2/m^2< A$. We then combine these inequalities and find/review the\nfollowing: (1) Any system must have a size greater than the Planck length, in\nthe sense that there exists a minimal area (2) We comment on the Minimal Length\nScenarios and the fate of Lorentz symmetry near the Planck scale (3) Quanta\nwith transplanckian frequencies are allowed in a large enough boxes (4) There\nexists a mass-dependent maximal acceleration given by $m c^3/\\hbar$ if $m<m_p$\nand by $c^4/G m$ if $m>m_p$ (5) There exists a mass dependent maximal force and\npower (6) There exists a maximal energy density and pressure (7) Physical\nsystems must obey the Holographic Principle (8) Holographic bounds can only be\nsaturated by systems with $m>m_p$; systems lying on the ``Compton line'' $l\n\\sim 1/m$ are fundamental objects without substructures (9) We speculate on a\nnew bound from above for the action.

As charged particles in\nextensive air showers are deflected by the magnetic field of the Earth, a\ndeformation of the angular distribution of the Cherenkov light, that would be\napproximately symmetric about the shower axis if no magnetic field were\npresent, is expected. In this work we study the variation of the Cherenkov\nlight distribution as a function of the azimuth angle in the plane\nperpendicular to shower axis. It is found that the asymmetry induced by the\ngeomagnetic field is most significant for early stages of shower evolution and\nfor showers arriving almost perpendicular to the vector of the local\ngeomagnetic field. Furthermore, it is shown that ignoring the azimuthal\nasymmetry of Cherenkov light might lead to a significant under- or\noverestimation of the Cherenkov light signal especially at sites where the\nlocal geomagnetic field is strong. Based on CORSIKA simulations, the azimuthal\ndistribution of Cherenkov light is parametrized in dependence on the magnetic\nfield component perpendicular to the shower axis and the local air density.\nThis parametrization provides an efficient approximation for estimating the\nasymmetry of the Cherenkov light distribution for shower simulation and\nreconstruction in cosmic ray and gamma-ray experiments in which the Cherenkov\nsignal of showers with energies above 10^14 eV is observed. \n\n"}

The experiment\nwill therefore have to cope with a much larger machine background than its\npredecessor Belle, in particular from events outside of the interaction region.\nWe present the concept of a track trigger, based on a neural network approach,\nthat is able to suppress a large fraction of this background by reconstructing\nthe $z$ (longitudinal) position of the event vertex within the latency of the\nfirst level trigger. The trigger uses the hit information from the Central\nDrift Chamber (CDC) of Belle II within narrow cones in polar and azimuthal\nangle as well as in transverse momentum (\"sectors\"), and estimates the\n$z$-vertex without explicit track reconstruction. The preprocessing for the\ntrack trigger is based on the track information provided by the standard CDC\ntrigger.

One\npossibility is that gas in atomic cooling halos exposed to strong Lyman-Werner\n(LW) radiation forms $10^4-10^6 ~ M_\\odot$ supermassive stars which quickly\ncollapse into black holes. We propose a scenario for direct collapse black hole\n(DCBH) formation based on synchronized pairs of pristine atomic cooling halos.\nWe consider halos at very small separation with one halo being a subhalo of the\nother. The first halo to surpass the atomic cooling threshold forms stars. Soon\nafter these stars are formed, the other halo reaches the cooling threshold and\ndue to its small distance from the newly formed galaxy, is exposed to the\ncritical LW intensity required to form a DCBH. The main advantage of this\nscenario is that synchronization can potentially prevent photoevaporation and\nmetal pollution in DCBH-forming halos. Since the halos reach the atomic cooling\nthreshold at nearly the same time, the DCBH-forming halo is only exposed to\nionizing radiation for a brief period. Tight synchronization could allow the\nDCBH to form before stars in the nearby galaxy reach the end of their lives and\ngenerate supernovae winds. We use N-body simulations to estimate the abundance\nof DCBHs formed in this way. The largest source of uncertainty in our estimate\nis the initial mass function (IMF) of metal free stars formed in atomic cooling\nhalos.

Using these observations, we have previously considered the\nrelativistic precession (RP) twin peak QPO model to estimate the mass of\ncentral NS in Circinus X-1. We have shown that such an estimate results in a\nspecific mass-angular-momentum (M-j) relation rather than a single preferred\ncombination of M and j. Here we confront our previous results with another\nbinary, the atoll source 4U 1636-53 that displays the twin peak QPOs at very\nhigh frequencies, and extend the consideration to various twin peak QPO models.\nIn analogy to the RP model, we find that these imply their own specific M-j\nrelations.

Based on the RP model, we demonstrate that this\ndichotomy is related to a strong variability of the model predictive power\nacross the frequency plane. This variability naturally comes from the radial\ndependence of characteristic frequencies of orbital motion. As a consequence,\nthe restrictions on the models resulting from observations of low-frequency\nsources are weaker than those in the case of high-frequency sources. Finally we\nalso discuss the need for a correction to the RP model and consider the\nremoving of M-j degeneracies, based on the twin peak QPO-independent angular\nmomentum estimates. \n\n"}

Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural\nmachine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be\njointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed\nrecently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of\nencoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into\na fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this\npaper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in\nimproving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and\npropose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for\nparts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word,\nwithout having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly.

We model CR acceleration at mildly\nrelativistic shocks, including all the significant energy loss processes. We\ncalculate CR and neutrino release from single GRBs, assuming that nuclei\nheavier than protons are present in the relativistic wind.

Models of quintessential\ninflation broadly fall into two classes, depending upon the early and late time\nbehavior of the field potential. In the first type we include models in which\nthe field potential is steep for most of the history of the Universe but turn\nshallow at late times, whereas in the second type the potential is shallow at\nearly times followed by a steep behavior thereafter.

Four fields have been monitored\nwith cadences between 15 minutes and several months. A total of 151 images were\nobtained, giving a total survey area of 2275 deg$^2$. We analysed our data\nusing standard LOFAR tools and searched for radio transients using the LOFAR\nTransients Pipeline (TraP).

We also show that\nlow-frequency radio surveys are more sensitive to steep-spectrum coherent\ntransient sources than GHz radio surveys. We used two new statistical methods\nto determine the upper limits on the transient surface density. One is free of\nassumptions on the flux distribution of the sources, while the other assumes a\npower-law distribution in flux and sets more stringent constraints on the\ntransient surface density. Both of these methods provide better constraints\nthan the approach used in previous works.

In\nscalar-tensor theories of gravity, a matter distribution around a black hole\ncan lead to the so called \"spontaneous scalarisation\" instability that triggers\nthe development of scalar hair. In the Brans-Dicke type theories, this effect\ncan be understood as a result of tachyonic effective mass of the scalar field.\nHere we consider the instability in the generalised class of scalar-theories\nthat feature non-conformal, i.e. \"disformal\", couplings to matter. Such\ntheories have gained considerable interest in the recent years and have been\nstudied in a wide variety of systems, both cosmological and astrophysical.

In the flat case,\n$\\bar{\\chi}(\\psi)$ and $\\chi(\\alpha)$ satisfy the first-order differential\nequations depending only on the logarithmic derivative of the potential. Once\nwe know a general analytic solution for one of these $\\chi$-functions, we can\nexplicitly derive all characteristics of the cosmological model. In the\n$\\alpha$-version, the whole dynamical system is integrable for $k\\neq 0$ and\nwith any `$\\alpha$-potential', $\\bar{v}(\\alpha)\\equiv v[\\psi(\\alpha)]$,\nreplacing $v(\\psi)$. There is no a priori relation between the two potentials\nbefore deriving $\\chi$ or $\\bar{\\chi}$, which implicitly depend on the\npotential itself, but relations between the two pictures can be found by\nasymptotic expansions or by inflationary perturbation theory. Explicit\napplications of the results to a more rigorous treatment of the chaotic\ninflation models and to their comparison with the ekpyrotic-bouncing ones are\noutlined in the frame of our `$\\alpha$-formulation' of isotropic scalaron\ncosmologies. In particular, we establish an inflationary perturbation expansion\nfor $\\chi$. When all the conditions for inflation are satisfied and $\\chi$\nobeys a certain boundary (initial) condition, we get the standard inflationary\nparameters, with higher-order corrections. \n\n"}

Our real-time search backend, ARTEMIS, utilizes graphics\nprocessing units to search for pulses with dispersion measures up to 320\ncm$^{-3}$ pc. Previous derived FRB rates from surveys around 1.4~GHz, and\nfavoured FRB interpretations, motivated this survey, despite all previous\ndetections occurring at higher dispersion measures. We detected no new FRBs\nabove a signal-to-noise threshold of 10, leading to the most stringent upper\nlimit yet on the FRB event rate at these frequencies: 29 sky$^{-1}$ day$^{-1}$\nfor 5~ms-duration pulses above 62~Jy.

We perform a series of\nscans over the NMSSM parameter space, compute the DM annihilation cross section\ninto two photons and the contribution of box-shaped features, and compare them\nwith the limits derived from the Fermi-LAT search for gamma-ray lines using the\nlatest Pass 8 data.

We also consider the recent upper limits from the Fermi-LAT\nsatellite on the continuum gamma-ray emission from dwarf spheroidal galaxies\n(dSphs). We show that in the case of the RH sneutrino the constraint on\ngamma-ray spectral features can be more stringent than the dSph bounds. This is\ndue to the Breit-Wigner enhancement near the ubiquitous resonances with a CP\neven Higgs and the contribution of scalar and pseudoscalar Higgs final states\nto box-shaped features.

At any luminosity probed, the disc in the\nhard state is intrinsically more variable than in the soft state. However, the\nfast decrease of disc variability as a function of luminosity, combined with\nthe increase of disc intensity, causes a net drop of fractional variability at\nhigh luminosities and low energies, which reminds the well-known behaviour of\ndisc-dominated energy bands in the soft state. The peak-frequency of the\nhigh-frequency Lorentzian (likely corresponding to the high-frequency break\nseen in active galactic nuclei, AGN) scales with luminosity, but we do not find\nevidence for a linear scaling.

The atmospheric calibration of the CTA\ntelescopes is a critical task. The atmosphere affects the measured Cherenkov\nyield in several ways: the air-shower development itself, the variation of the\nCherenkov angle with altitude, the loss of photons due to scattering and\nabsorption of Cherenkov light out of the camera field-of-view and the\nscattering of photons into the camera. In this scenario, aerosols are the most\nvariable atmospheric component in time and space and therefore need a\ncontinuous monitoring.

Its prime scientific\ngoal is to measure the masses and radii of non-accreting neutron stars via fits\nto the energy-dependent waveforms produced by the rotation of hot spots on\ntheir surfaces. These measurements will provide valuable input to theoretical\nmodels of cold matter beyond nuclear density. Here we propose that PSR\nJ1614$-$2230, despite its low count rate, is a promising source to observe with\nNICER. The reason is that XMM-Newton observations suggest that the fractional\noscillation amplitude from PSR J1614$-$2230 could be high enough that this star\ncannot be very compact. We show that if we analyze 0.5 Ms of NICER data and 0.1\nMs of nearby off-source data and combine that analysis with the known mass of\nthis star, we would find a robust lower limit to the radius with a statistical\nuncertainty of only $\\sim 0.5-0.7$ km.

Unlike existing autocorrelation methods for\nthis type of analysis, which also use angular separations between neutrino\npairs, our method incorporates information about the point spread function and\ncan identify individual point sources.

When we apply an AC current to a superconductor, the\nCooper pairs oscillate and acquire kinetic inductance, that can be measured by\ninserting the superconductor in a LC circuit with high merit factor.\nInteractions in the superconductor can break the Cooper pairs, causing sizable\nvariations in the kinetic inductance and, thus, in the response of the LC\ncircuit. The continuous monitoring of the amplitude and frequency modulation\nallows to reconstruct the incident energy with excellent sensitivity.

They evade the usual slow-roll\nconditions on $V$ because their kinetic energies are dominated by\nsingle-derivative terms rather than the usual two-derivative terms. Single\nderivatives dominate during slow roll and so do not require a breakdown of the\nusual derivative expansion that underpins calculational control in much of\ncosmology. The presence of such terms requires some sort of UV Lorentz-symmetry\nbreaking during inflation (besides the usual cosmological breaking).\nChromo-natural inflation provides an example of a UV theory that can generate\nthe multi-field single-derivative terms we consider, and we argue that the EFT\nwe find indeed captures the slow-roll conditions for the background evolution\nfor Chromo-natural inflation.

In the KCC approach we describe the time evolution of the scalar\nfield cosmologies in geometric terms, by performing a \"second geometrization\",\nby considering them as paths of a semispray. By introducing a non-linear\nconnection and a Berwald type connection associated to the Friedmann and\nKlein-Gordon equations, five geometrical invariants can be constructed, with\nthe second invariant giving the Jacobi stability of the cosmological model.

Unfortunately, NMT systems are\nknown to be computationally expensive both in training and in translation\ninference. Also, most NMT systems have difficulty with rare words. These issues\nhave hindered NMT's use in practical deployments and services, where both\naccuracy and speed are essential. In this work, we present GNMT, Google's\nNeural Machine Translation system, which attempts to address many of these\nissues. Our model consists of a deep LSTM network with 8 encoder and 8 decoder\nlayers using attention and residual connections. To improve parallelism and\ntherefore decrease training time, our attention mechanism connects the bottom\nlayer of the decoder to the top layer of the encoder. To accelerate the final\ntranslation speed, we employ low-precision arithmetic during inference\ncomputations. To improve handling of rare words, we divide words into a limited\nset of common sub-word units (\"wordpieces\") for both input and output. This\nmethod provides a good balance between the flexibility of \"character\"-delimited\nmodels and the efficiency of \"word\"-delimited models, naturally handles\ntranslation of rare words, and ultimately improves the overall accuracy of the\nsystem.

Once\na rare galaxy is identified, studying it more effectively requires a set of\ngalaxies of similar morphology, allowing generalization and statistical\nanalysis that cannot be done when $N=1$. Databases generated by digital sky\nsurveys can contain a very large number of galaxy images, and therefore once a\nrare galaxy of interest is identified it is possible that more instances of the\nsame morphology are also present in the database. However, when a researcher\nidentifies a certain galaxy of rare morphology in the database, it is virtually\nimpossible to mine the database manually in the search for galaxies of similar\nmorphology. Here we propose a computer method that can automatically search\ndatabases of galaxy images and identify galaxies that are morphologically\nsimilar to a certain user-defined query galaxy. That is, the researcher\nprovides an image of a galaxy of interest, and the pattern recognition system\nautomatically returns a list of galaxies that are visually similar to the\ntarget galaxy. The algorithm uses a comprehensive set of descriptors, allowing\nit to support different types of galaxies, and it is not limited to a finite\nset of known morphology. While the list of returned galaxies is neither clean\nnor complete, it contains a far higher frequency of galaxies of the morphology\nof interest, providing a substantial reduction of the data.

Subsequently, we study both the homogenous cosmological sector and\nlinear perturbations of such a test field.

Giant planets that arrive with periastron\ndistances that are smaller than the Roche limit $a_\\mathrm{R}$ lose their\ngaseous envelopes, resulting in an inner edge to the surviving planets'\ndistribution. The observational evidence for this effect, while extensive, is\nnonetheless somewhat ambiguous because of the effect of tidal orbital decay.\nHere we consider another key prediction of the HEM scenario---the existence of\na spatial eccentricity gradient near the location where the circularization\ntime becomes comparable to the planet's age for typical parameters. Previous\nstudies already found evidence for this gradient and demonstrated that its\nproperties are consistent with the circularization process being dominated by\ntidal dissipation in the planet (encapsulated by the tidal quality factor\n$Q^\\prime_\\mathrm{p}$).

In such scenario, the signal generated by each PE is entangled to the\nothers, and an accurate PMT charge reconstruction becomes challenging. This\nmanuscript describes an experimental method able to address the PMT charge\nreconstruction in the case of large PE pile-up, providing an unbiased charge\nestimator at the permille level up to 15 detected PEs.

Unexpected discoveries, such as the\ndiphoton excess F(750 GeV) seen at the LHC, could strongly motivate the\nconstruction of a photon collider. In order to enable the gamma-gamma collision\noption, the ILC design should be compatible with it from the very beginning. In\nthis paper, we discuss the problem of the beam crossing angle. In the ILC\ntechnical design, this angle is 14 mrad, which is just enough to provide enough\nspace for the final quadrupoles and outgoing beams. For gamma-gamma collisions,\nthe crossing angle must be larger because the low-energy electrons that result\nfrom multiple Compton scattering get large disruption angles in collisions with\nthe opposing electron beam and some deflection in the solenoidal detector\nfield. For a 2E=500 GeV collider, the required crossing angle is about 25 mrad.\nIn this paper, we consider the factors that determine the crossing angle as\nwell as its minimum permissible value that does not yet cause a considerable\nreduction of the gamma-gamma luminosity. It is shown that the best solution is\nto increase the laser wavelength from the current 1 \\mum (which is optimal for\n2E=500 GeV) to 2 \\mum as this makes possible achieving high gamma-gamma\nluminosities at a crossing angle of 20 mrad, which is also quite comfortable\nfor e+e- collisions, does not cause any degradation of the e+e- luminosity and\nopens the possibility for a more energetic future collider in the same tunnel\n(e.g., CLIC). Moreover, the 2 \\mum wavelength is optimal for a 2E = 1 TeV\ncollider, e.g., a possible ILC energy upgrade.

In this\npaper, we present optical (rest-frame UV) Keck spectropolarimetry of five\nluminous obscured (Type 2) and extremely red quasars (ERQs) at z~2.5. Three\nobjects reach polarization fractions of >10% in the continuum. We propose a\nmodel in which dust scattering is the dominant scattering and polarization\nmechanism in our targets, though electron scattering cannot be completely\nexcluded. Emission lines are polarized at a lower level than is the continuum.\nThis suggests that the emission-line region exists on similar spatial scales as\nthe scattering region. In three objects we detect an intriguing 90 degree swing\nin the polarization position angle as a function of line-of-sight velocity in\nthe emission lines of Ly-alpha, CIV and NV. We interpret this phenomenon in the\nframework of a geometric model with an equatorial dusty scattering region in\nwhich the material is outflowing at several thousand km/sec.

In this work we study\nthe kinematics of the globular cluster (GC) systems of three lenticular\ngalaxies located in low density environments (NGC 2768, NGC 3115 and NGC 7457),\nand compare them with the kinematics of planetary nebulae (PNe).

It is thus a stepping stone to\nunderstand the complex formation processes of stars in starburst regions across\nthe Universe. Here, we have studied the formation history of massive stars in\n30 Dor using masses and ages derived for 452 mainly OB stars from the\nspectroscopic VLT-FLAMES Tarantula Survey (VFTS). We find that stars of all\nages and masses are scattered throughout 30 Dor. This is remarkable because it\nimplies that massive stars either moved large distances or formed independently\nover the whole field of view in relative isolation. We find that both channels\ncontribute to the 30 Dor massive star population. Massive star formation\nrapidly accelerated about 8 Myr ago, first forming stars in the field before\ngiving birth to the stellar populations in NGC 2060 and NGC 2070.

Using data from the GMRT we show\nthat post-correlation beamformation results in a many-folds increase in the\nsignal-to-noise for periodic signals from pulsars and several order of\nmagnitude reduction in the number of false triggers from single pulse events\nlike fast radio bursts (FRBs). This difference arises primarily because the\npost-correlation beam contains less red-noise, as well as less radio frequency\ninterference. The post-correlation beam can also be more easily calibrated than\nthe incoherent or phased array beams. We also discuss two different modes of\npost-correlation beamformation, viz. (1) by subtracting the incoherent beam\nfrom the coherent beam and (2) by phased addition of the visibilities.

Temperature fluctuations from X-ray heating of the\nneutral intergalactic medium can dominate the fluctuations in the 21-cm signal\nfrom this time. This heating depends on the abundance, clustering, and\nproperties of the X-ray sources present, which remain highly uncertain. We\npresent a suite of three new large-volume, 349\\,Mpc a side, fully numerical\nradiative transfer simulations including QSO-like sources, extending the work\npreviously presented in Ross et al. (2017). The results show that our QSOs have\na modest contribution to the heating budget, yet significantly impact the 21-cm\nsignal. Initially, the power spectrum is boosted on large scales by heating\nfrom the biased QSO-like sources, before decreasing on all scales. Fluctuations\nfrom images of the 21-cm signal with resolutions corresponding to SKA1-Low at\nthe appropriate redshifts are well above the expected noise for deep\nintegrations, indicating that imaging could be feasible for all the X-ray\nsource models considered. The most notable contribution of the QSOs is a\ndramatic increase in non-Gaussianity of the signal, as measured by the skewness\nand kurtosis of the 21-cm probability distribution functions. However, in the\ncase of late Lyman-$\\alpha$ saturation, this non-Gaussianity could be\ndramatically decreased particularly when heating occurs earlier.

However, the\ninformation capacity of the discarded variables will inevitably change as the\nuniverse expands, generating \"quantum bias\" (QB) in the Friedmann equations\n[Phys. Lett.

If information could be\nstored in each Planck-volume independently, this effect would give rise to a\nconstant acceleration $10^{120}$ times larger than that observed, reproducing\nthe usual cosmological constant problem.

First, we study the accuracy of the\nPlanck-HFI calibration using the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) dipole\nmeasured by COBE as well as the Earth orbital motion dipole. We show that we\ncan reach for HFI, a relative calibration between rings of about 1% and an\nabsolute calibration better than 0.4% for the CMB channels (in the end, the\nabsolute calibration will be limited by the uncertainties on the CMB\ntemperature).

Second, we\ninvestigate the detection of the Cosmic Far-Infrared Background (FIRB) dipole.\nMeasuring this dipole could give a new and independent determination of the\nFIRB for which a direct determination is quite difficult due to Galactic dust\nemission contamination. We show that such a detection would require a Galactic\ndust emission removal at better than 1%, which will be very hard to achieve. \n\n"}

Reynolds-stress and turbulent Maxwell-stress\nclosure models will necessarily introduce a suite of transport coefficients,\nall of which are to some degree model-dependent. One of the most important\ncoefficients is the relaxation time for the turbulent Maxwell stress, which\nuntil recently has been relatively ignored.

We also show that, although\ntwo-dimensional data coverage help in constraining the orbital structure of the\nmodelled galaxy, it does not in principle solve the indeterminacy issue, which\nmostly originates from the discretization of such an inverse problem. We show\nthat adding regularization constraints stabilizes the confidence level contours\non which the estimation of black hole mass and stellar mass-to-light ratio are\nbased. We therefore propose to systematically use regularization as a tool to\nprevent the solution to depend on the orbit library. Regularization, however,\nintroduces an unavoidable bias on the derived solutions.

The group is dominated by an optically\nluminous giant elliptical galaxy and all other known group members are at least\ntwo magnitudes fainter. The global X-ray properties (luminosity, temperature,\nextent) of NGC 6482 fall within the range of other groups, but the detailed\nproperties show interesting differences. We derive the gas temperature and\ntotal mass profiles for the central 30 kpc using ACIS spatially resolved\nspectroscopy. The temperature profile shows a continuous decrease outward,\ndropping to 0.63 of its central value at 0.1 r_200. The derived total mass\nprofile is strongly centrally peaked, suggesting an early formation epoch.\nThese results support a picture in which fossil groups are old, giving time for\nthe most massive galaxies to have merged to produce a central giant elliptical\ngalaxy.\n  Although the cooling time within 0.1 r_200 is less than a Hubble time, no\ndecrease in central temperature is detected. The entropy of the system lies\ntoward the low side of the distribution seen in poor groups, and it drops all\nthe way into the centre of the system, reaching very low values. No isentropic\ncore, such as those predicted in simple preheating models, is present. Given\nthe lack of any central temperature drop in the system, it seems unlikely that\nradiative cooling can be invoked to explain this low central entropy. We find\nthat the centrally peaked temperature profile is consistent with a steady-state\ncooling flow solution with an accretion rate of 2 solar mass per year, given\nthe large PdV work arising from the cuspy mass profile. However, solutions\ninvolving distributed or non-steady heating cannot be ruled out. \n\n"}

A stellar sample of 20 disk\ndwarfs/subgiants of F5 to G8 spectral types with -0.8 <= [Fe/H] <= +0.3 was\nselected.

The code evolves spherical gaseous shells in an expanding\nUniverse by employing a MOND-type relationship between the fluctuations in the\ndensity field and the gravitational force, $g$. We focus on the evolution of\ninitial density perturbations of the form $\\delta_{i}\\sim r_{i}^{-s}$ for\n$0<s<3$. A shell is initially cold and remains so until it encounters the shock\nformed by the earlier collapse of shells nearer to the centre. During the early\nepochs $g$ is sufficiently large and shells move according to Newtonian\ngravity. As the physical size of the perturbation increases with time, $g$ gets\nsmaller and the evolution eventually becomes MOND dominated. However, the\ndensity in the inner collapsed regions is large enough that they re-enter the\nNewtonian regime. The evolved gas temperature and density profiles tend to a\nuniversal form that is independent of the the slope, $s$, and of the initial\namplitude. An analytic explanation of this intriguing result is offered. Over a\nwide range of scales, the temperature, density and entropy profiles in the\nsimulations, depend on radius roughly like $r^{0.5}$, $r^{-1.5}$ and $r^{1.5}$,\nrespectively.

We calculate formation and merging\nhistories, and the evolution in colour, luminosity and morphology of the galaxy\npopulations in different environments. Roughly $ 50\\ %$ of ellipticals in our\nmodel have undergone a major merger since $z = 0.5$, yet in spite of this we\nfind that cluster ellipticals have colour-magnitude diagrams with remarkably\nsmall scatter. The morphological mix of galaxies that become rich cluster\nmembers at high redshift is dominated by spiral galaxies, due to the long\ntimescale for galaxy mergers compared with the timescale for cluster assembly\nat high redshift. The assembly of low redshift clusters is slower, allowing\nmore galaxy mergers to occur in the progenitor halos.

Such anisotropic vacuum toroidal\nmetrics, the first example was given in gr-qc/0005025, differ substantially\nfrom the well known toroidal black holes (see hep-th/9511188 and gr-qc/9709013)\nwhich were constructed as non-vacuum solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell gravity\nwith cosmological constant.

We use our off shell superfield formulation and\ngive a detailed description of the issue of SUSY breaking by the F-component of\nthe radion superfield.

Wind speed (U10) was around 10\nm/s, and SWH up to 2 m. A geophysical parametric waveform model was used for\nretracking and estimation of the lapse between the direct and reflected signals\nwith a 1-second precision of 3 m. The lapse was used to estimate the SSH along\nthe track using a differential model. The RMS error of the 20 km averaged\nGNSS-R absolute altimetric solution with respect to Jason-1 SSH and a GPS buoy\nmeasurement was of 10 cm, with a 2 cm mean difference.

{"id": "physics/0609147", "contents": "Title: The effect of AM noise on correlation phase noise measurements Abstract: We analyze the phase-noise measurement methods in which correlation and\naveraging is used to reject the background noise of the instrument. All the\nknown methods make use of a mixer, used either as a saturated phase detector or\nas a linear synchronous detector. Unfortunately, AM noise is taken in through\nthe power-to-dc-offset conversion mechanism that results from the mixer\nasymmetry. The measurement of some mixers indicates that the unwanted\namplitude-to-voltage gain is of the order of 5-50 mV, which is 12-35 dB lower\nthan the phase-to-voltage gain of the mixer. In addition, the trick of setting\nthe mixer at a sweet point -- off the quadrature condition -- where the\nsensitivity to AM nulls, works only with microwave mixers. The HF-VHF mixers\nhave not this sweet point. Moreover, we prove that if the AM noise comes from\nthe oscillator under test, it can not be rejected by correlation. At least not\nwith the schemes currently used. An example shows that at some critical\nfrequencies the unwanted effect of AM noise is of the same order -- if not\ngreater -- than the phase noise. Thus, experimental mistakes are around the\ncorner. \n\n"}
