In four dimensions, they obey the\ncorresponding Majumdar-Papapetrou system, where the gravitational potential is\na simple function of the electric potential field and the fluid, when there is\none, is made of extremal dust. The Majumdar-Papapetrou system can be\ngeneralized to d spacetime dimensions. Thus, it is natural to study Bonnor\nsolutions in higher d dimensions. We analyze Newton-Coulomb theory with an\nelectrically charged fluid in a Majumdar-Papapetrou context, in d=n+1 spacetime\ndimensions, n the number of spatial dimensions. Within the Newtonian theory, in\nvacuum, the Majumdar-Papapetrou relation for the gravitational potential in\nterms of the electric potential, and its related Weyl relation, are equivalent,\nin contrast with general relativity.

When\nthe individual diffusion process is a one-dimensional Brownian motion, the\nnoncolliding process is equivalent in distribution with the eigenvalue process\nof an $N \\times N$ Hermitian-matrix-valued process, which we call Dyson's\nmodel. For any deterministic initial configuration of $N$ particles,\ndistribution of particle positions of the noncolliding Brownian motion on the\nreal line at any fixed time $t >0$ is a determinantal point process. We can\nprove that the process is determinantal in the sense that the multi-time\ncorrelation function for any chosen series of times, which determines joint\ndistributions at these times, is also represented by a determinant.

In the case of continuous curves, we demand that the energy function\nmust be invariant under local frame rotations, and it should also transform\ncovariantly under reparametrizations of the curve. This leads us to consider\nenergy functions that are constructed from the conserved quantities in the\nhierarchy of the integrable nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation (NLSE).

Starting with a cylinder, the\ncommuting periodic single-row transfer matrices are built from the periodic\nTemperley-Lieb algebra extended by the shift operators Omega and Omega^{-1}. In\nthis enlarged algebra, the non-contractible loop fugacity is alpha and the\ncontractible loop fugacity is beta. The torus is formed by gluing the top and\nbottom of the cylinder.

Here we demonstrate that, at least for {\\it even integer} beta,\nthese systems are classically integrable, e.g. there are Lax pairs associated\nwith them, which we explicitly construct.

Initiated by Br\\'ezin and Zinn-Justin, the\napproach has led to encouraging results, first for matrix integrals and then\nquantum mechanics with matrices, but has not yet become a universal tool as\ninitially hoped. In particular, general quantum field theories with matrix\nfields require more detailed investigations. To better understand some of the\nencountered difficulties, we first apply analogous ideas to the simpler O(N)\nsymmetric vector models, models that can be solved quite generally in the large\nN limit. Unlike other attempts, our method is a close extension of Br\\'ezin and\nZinn-Justin. Discussing vector and matrix models with similar approximation\nscheme, we notice that in all cases (vector and matrix integrals, vector and\nmatrix path integrals in the local approximation), at leading order,\nnon-trivial fixed points satisfy the same universal algebraic equation, and\nthis is the main result of this work. However, its precise meaning and role\nhave still to be better understood. \n\n"}

Our derivation is a quite\nminimal one as it requires only the time independent evolution of scalar\nproducts and invariance under complex Lorentz transformations. The first of\nthese requirements does not force the Hamiltonian to be Hermitian. Rather, it\nforces its eigenvalues to either be real or to appear in complex conjugate\npairs, forces the eigenvectors of such conjugate pairs to be conjugates of each\nother, and forces the Hamiltonian to admit of an antilinear symmetry. The\nlatter requirement then forces this antilinear symmetry to be $CPT$, with\nHermiticity of a Hamiltonian thus only being a sufficient condition for $CPT$\nsymmetry and not a necessary one. $CPT$ symmetry thus has primacy over\nHermiticity, and it rather than Hermiticity should be taken as a guiding\nprinciple for constructing quantum theories.

On one hand, current cosmological observations\nconstrain the properties of possible environments and place upper bounds on the\ninteraction strengths.

As such, quantum\ngeneral covariance bears on the ability to consistently switch between the\ndescriptions of the same physics relative to arbitrary choices of quantum\nreference system.

It links the descriptions\nrelative to different choices of quantum reference system, identified as the\ncorrespondingly reduced quantum theories, via the reference-system-neutral\nDirac quantization, in analogy to coordinate changes on a manifold.

For Schwarzschild dS, there is a dimension independent\nformula for the frequencies, except in dimension d=5 where the formula is\ndifferent. For RN dS there is a dimension dependent formula for the\nfrequencies, except in dimension d=5 where the formula is different.\nSchwarzschild and RN AdS black hole spacetimes are simpler: the formulae for\nthe frequencies will depend upon a parameter related to the tortoise coordinate\nat spatial infinity, and scalar type perturbations in dimension d=5 lead to a\ncontinuous spectrum for the quasinormal frequencies.

It has been\ninterpreted as incompatibility of the requirement of locality with quantum\nmechanics. We point out that in fact the space part of the wave function was\nneglected in the proof of Bell's theorem. However this space part is crucial\nfor considerations of property of locality of quantum system. Actually the\nspace part leads to an extra factor in quantum correlations and as a result the\nordinary proof of Bell's theorem fails in this case.

We study the influence on the stability of\ntwo Floquet states when their Floquet energies (real part) encounter a direct\nor an avoided crossing at resonance. The effect of the amplitude of oscillation\non the nature of crossing of Floquet energies is also discussed. It is found\nthat by adiabatically changing the frequency and amplitude of the oscillation\nfield, one can manipulate the stability of states in the well. By means of a\ndiscrete transform, the two models are shown to have exactly the same Floquet\nenergy spectrum at the same oscillating amplitude and frequency.
