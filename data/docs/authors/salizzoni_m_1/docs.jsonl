The fast roll stage leads to a purely\nattractive potential for the curvature and tensor perturbations (this potential\nis purely repulsive in slowroll). This attractive potential depresses the CMB\nquadrupole moment for the curvature and B-mode spectra. A single new\ncosmological parameter emerges: the comoving wavenumber k_1 characteristic\nscale of this attractive potential.k_1 happens to exit the horizon precisely at\nthe transition from fast to slowroll.The fastroll stage dynamically modifies\nthe initial power spectrum by a transfer function D(k). We compute D(k) by\nsolving the inflaton evolution equations. D(k) suppresses the primordial power\nfor k < k_1 and enjoys the scaling property D(k) = Psi(k/k_1) where Psi(x) is\nan universal function. We perform a MCMC analysis of the WMAP/SDSS data\nincluding the fast-roll stage and find k_1 = 0.266/Gpc. The quadrupole mode k_Q\n= 0.242/Gpc exits the horizon 1/10 of an efold before k_1.

In this paper,\nwe consider the spectral dimension of quantum states of spatial geometry\ndefined on combinatorial complexes endowed with additional algebraic data: the\nkinematical quantum states of loop quantum gravity (LQG). Preliminarily, the\neffects of topology and discreteness of classical discrete geometries are\nstudied in a systematic manner. We look for states reproducing the spectral\ndimension of a classical space in the appropriate regime. We also test the\nhypothesis that in LQG, as in other approaches, there is a scale dependence of\nthe spectral dimension, which runs from the topological dimension at large\nscales to a smaller one at short distances. While our results do not give any\nstrong support to this hypothesis, we can however pinpoint when the topological\ndimension is reproduced by LQG quantum states. Overall, by exploring the\ninterplay of combinatorial, topological and geometrical effects, and by\nconsidering various kinds of quantum states such as coherent states and their\nsuperpositions, we find that the spectral dimension of discrete quantum\ngeometries is more sensitive to the underlying combinatorial structures than to\nthe details of the additional data associated with them. \n\n"}

In particular, the HDE model is highly degenerate\nwith the $\\Lambda$CDM model, and in the HDE model the cases with different\nparameter values are also in strong degeneracy. Since the observational data\nare mainly within the low-redshift region, it is very important to break this\nlow-redshift degeneracy in the $H(z)$ and $q(z)$ diagnostics by using some\nquantities with higher order derivatives of the scale factor.

Typically, in such situations, the scalar power spectrum\nexhibits a burst of features associated with modes that leave the Hubble radius\neither immediately before or during the epoch of fast roll. Moreover, one also\nfinds that the power spectrum turns scale invariant at smaller scales\ncorresponding to modes that leave the Hubble radius at later stages, when slow\nroll has been restored. In other words, the imprints of brief departures from\nslow roll, arising out of sharp shapes in the inflaton potential, are usually\nof a finite width in the scalar power spectrum. Intuitively, one may imagine\nthat the scalar bi-spectrum too may exhibit a similar behavior, i.e. a\nrestoration of scale invariance at small scales, when slow roll has been\nreestablished. However, in the case of the Starobinsky model (viz. the model\ndescribed by a linear inflaton potential with a sudden change in its slope)\ninvolving the canonical scalar field, it has been found that, a rather sharp,\nthough short, departure from slow roll can leave a lasting and significant\nimprint on the bi-spectrum.

Satisfying scheme\ninvariance is a challenging problem for perturbative QCD (pQCD), since a\ntruncated perturbation series does not automatically satisfy the requirements\nof the renormalization group. Two distinct approaches for satisfying the RGI\nprinciple have been suggested in the literature. One is the \"Principle of\nMaximum Conformality\" (PMC) in which the terms associated with the\n$\\beta$-function are absorbed into the scale of the running coupling at each\nperturbative order; its predictions are scheme and scale independent at every\nfinite order. The other approach is the \"Principle of Minimum Sensitivity\"\n(PMS), which is based on local RGI; the PMS approach determines the optimal\nrenormalization scale by requiring the slope of the approximant of an\nobservable to vanish. In this paper, we present a detailed comparison of the\nPMC and PMS procedures by analyzing two physical observables $R_{e+e-}$ and\n$\\Gamma(H\\to b\\bar{b})$ up to four-loop order in pQCD. At the four-loop level,\nthe PMC and PMS predictions for both observables agree within small errors with\nthose of conventional scale setting assuming a physically-motivated scale, and\neach prediction shows small scale dependences. However, the convergence of the\npQCD series at high orders, behaves quite differently: The PMC displays the\nbest pQCD convergence since it eliminates divergent renormalon terms; in\ncontrast, the convergence of the PMS prediction is questionable, often even\nworse than the conventional prediction based on an arbitrary guess for the\nrenormalization scale. ...... \n\n"}

The coordinate singularity of the FRW patch is identified\nwith the proper time at which the Hilbert space of the causal diamond becomes\ninfinite dimensional. For diamonds much smaller than the AdS radius, RAdS, the\ntime dependent Hamiltonians of HST are the same as those used to describe\nsimilar diamonds in Minkowski space. In particular, they are invariant under\nthe fuzzy analog of volume preserving diffeomorphisms of the holographic\nscreen, which leads to fast scrambling of perturbations on the horizon of a\nblack hole of size smaller than RAdS. We argue that, in order to take a limit\nof this system which converges to a CFT, one must choose Hamiltonians, in a\nrange of proper times of order RAdS, which break this invariance, and become\nlocal in a particular choice of basis for the variables. We show that,\nbeginning with flat, sub-RAdS, patches of dimension D, the resulting CFT,\nconstructed from the variables of HST, is inconsistent with the entropy of\nlarge black holes, unless one has at least two compact dimensions, whose size\nis of order RAdS.

For dual\nboundary field theories which are supersymmetric it is natural to ask whether\nthis defines a supersymmetric renormalization scheme. Recent results in\nlocalization have brought this question into sharp focus: rigid supersymmetry\non a curved boundary requires specific geometric structures, and general\narguments imply that BPS observables, such as the partition function, are\ninvariant under certain deformations of these structures. One can then ask if\nthe dual holographic observables are similarly invariant. We study this\nquestion in minimal N = 2 gauged supergravity in four and five dimensions. In\nfour dimensions we show that holographic renormalization precisely reproduces\nthe expected field theory results.

The thesis study is\nexpected to reveal salient properties of matter dynamics in affine spacetime\nand may reveal an intimate connection between vacuum state and metrical\ngravity. An interesting application of the framework is the inflationary\nregime, where it is shown that affine gravity prefers only a unique metric\ntensor such that the transition from nonminimal to minimal coupling of the\ninflaton is performed only via redefinition of the latter. This allows us to\navoid the use of the so called conformal frames.

The local maximum of the Higgs potential at the\nsymmetric point also contradicts with the conjecture. In order to make the\nStandard Model consistent with the conjecture, it has been proposed to\nintroduce a quintessence field, $Q$, which couples to the cosmological constant\nand the local maximum of the Higgs potential.

When applied to the spectral analysis of Green\nfunctions (which are then to be expanded as series in a parameter, usually the\ntime), these methods show: (1) The \"local\" or \"global\" dependence of the\nexpansion coefficients on the background geometry, etc., is determined by the\nregularity of the asymptotic expansion of the integrand at the origin (in\n\"frequency space\"); this marks the difference between a heat kernel and a\nWightman two-point function, for instance.

The method of matched asymptotic expansions is used to\ndeal with the large range of length scales that appear in the problem. We\nderive a sufficient condition for the local time variation of the scalar fields\ndriving variations in 'constants' to track their large-scale cosmological\nvariation and show that this is consistent with our earlier conjecture derived\nfrom the spherically symmetric problem. We perform our analysis with spacetime\nbackgrounds that are of Szekeres-Szafron type. They are approximately\nSchwarzschild in some locality and free of gravitational waves everywhere. At\nlarge distances, we assume that the spacetime matches smoothly onto a Friedmann\nbackground universe.

This model is constructed from string-like quantum solitons\nintroduced previously, and exploits the well-known relation between string\npartition functions and scalar field theories in d=3. Center vortices\ncorresponding to magnetic flux J (in units of 2\\pi /N) are composites of J\nelementary J=1 constituent vortices that come in N-1 types, with repulsion\nbetween like constituents and attraction between unlike constituents. The\nscalar field theory involves N scalar fields \\phi_i (one of which is\neliminated) that can merge, dissociate, and recombine while conserving flux mod\nN. The properties of these fields are deduced directly from the corresponding\ngauge-theory quantum solitons.

The relation between the\nfree fermionic models and the underlying Z2 X Z2 toroidal orbifolds is\ndiscussed.

The\nbasic dynamical principle involved is identified as the Jacobi's principle of\nleast action for given energy which is reparametrization invariant, and thus\nthe appearance of a gauge freedom is naturally understood. The separation of\nvariables in operator formalism corresponds to a choice of gauge in path\nintegral, and the Green's function is shown to be gauge independent if the\noperator ordering is properly taken into account.

They are bigger, colder, and longer-lived\nthan a usual $(3+1)$-dimensional black hole of the same mass. Furthermore, they\nprimarily decay into harmless bulk graviton modes rather than standard-model\ndegrees of freedom. We discuss the interplay of our scenario with the\nholographic principle.

To make this possible, we use light-front\nfield theory to isolate vacuum effects, and we place a smooth cutoff on the\nHamiltonian to force its free-state matrix elements to quickly decrease as the\ndifference of the free masses of the states increases. The cutoff violates a\nnumber of physical principles of light-front field theory, including Lorentz\ncovariance and gauge covariance. This means that the operators in the\nHamiltonian are not required to respect these physical principles. However, by\nrequiring the Hamiltonian to produce cutoff-independent physical quantities and\nby requiring it to respect the unviolated physical principles of the theory, we\nare able to derive recursion relations that define the Hamiltonian to all\norders in perturbation theory in terms of the fundamental parameters of the\nfield theory.

In particular, we consider ways of\nextending T-duality to include additional corrections to the Kaehler potential\nin heterotic string models with N=2 subsectors. \n\n"}

In this paper, we show that\nvirtual alternating links and tangles are naturally associated with the $1/N^2$\nexpansion of an integral over $N\\times N$ complex matrices. We suggest that it\nis sufficient to count the equivalence classes of these diagrams modulo\nordinary (planar) flypes. To test this hypothesis, we use an algorithm coding\nthe corresponding Feynman diagrams by means of permutations that generates\nvirtual diagrams up to 6 crossings and computes various invariants. Under this\nhypothesis, we use known results on matrix integrals to get the generating\nfunctions of virtual alternating tangles of genus 1 to 5 up to order 10 (i.e.\\\n10 real crossings). The asymptotic behavior for $n$ large of the numbers of\nlinks and tangles of genus $h$ and with $n$ crossings is also computed for\n$h=1,2,3$ and conjectured for general $h$. \n\n"}

The\nanswers involve a certain plane algebraic curve, which is the spectral curve of\nthe Kasteleyn operator of the graph. For example, the surface tension is the\nLegendre dual of the Ronkin function of the spectral curve. The amoeba of the\nspectral curve represents the phase diagram of the dimer model. Further, we\nprove that the spectral curve of a dimer model is always a real curve of\nspecial type, namely it is a Harnack curve. This implies many qualitative and\nquantitative statement about the behavior of the dimer model, such as existence\nof smooth phases, decay rate of correlations, growth rate of height function\nfluctuations, etc. \n\n"}

We then propose a description of\nn-dimensional unitary extended TQFTs as weak n-functors from the \"free stable\nweak n-category with duals on one object\" to the n-category of \"n-Hilbert\nspaces\".
