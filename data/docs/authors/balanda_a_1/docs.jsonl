Strong parton energy loss has been observed in central\nnucleus-nucleus collisions as evidenced by the a large suppression of the yield\nof high pT hadrons as compared to the expected yield based on measurements in\np+p collisions.

Helioseismological\nanomalies may be partially resolved if the Sun captures light, non-annihilating\ndark matter particles, a currently discussed dark matter candidate that is\nmotivated by recent direct detection limits. Once trapped, such particles (4-10\nGeV) naturally fill the solar core.

To model the real-time non-perturbative effects in the\npropagation of a high energy jet through the strongly coupled QCD matter, we\nadopt an effective dimensionally reduced description in terms of the $(1+1)$\nquasi-Abelian Schwinger theory. This theory is exactly soluble at any value of\nthe coupling and shares with QCD the properties of dynamical generation of\n\"mesons\" with a finite mass and the screening of \"quark\" charge that are\ncrucial for describing the transition of the jet into hadrons.

We show that dynamical chiral symmetry breaking (DCSB) suppresses the\naxial-charge of a dressed-quark, g_A^q, at infrared momenta. Since this effect\ndisappears as chiral symmetry is restored, one may argue that g_A vanishes with\nthe restoration of chiral symmetry because no nucleon bound-state survives the\nassociated transition. The suppression of g_A^q is shown to be part of an\nexplanation for a 25% reduction of g_A from its nonrelativistic quark-model\nvalue. Critical too, however, is the presence of dressed-quark angular momentum\nwithin the nucleon. The value of g_A^q depends on the kernels of the gap and\nBethe-Salpeter equations.

Abstract: The hadron spectroscopy is studied through the use of fractals and discrete\nscale invariance (DSI) implying log-periodic corrections to continuous scaling.\nThe masses of mesons and baryons, reported by the Particle Data Group (PDG),\nagree with (DSI), as well as the masses of exotic narrow mesons, baryons, and\ndibaryons.\n  Two distributions are systematically studied: first the log of the masses\nversus the log of their rank, and also the successive mass ratios. Each fitted\nparameter of the second distributions, as a function of the hadronic masses,\ndisplays the same shape for all PDG hadronic families and species. The same\nparameters allow good fits for the narrow exotic mesons, baryons and dibaryons.\n  When the successive mass ratios between different baryon families are\nconstant, this property is not observed between different meson families. Such\nobservation is studied within the double mass ratios eliminating the quark\nmasses, but the difference between baryons and mesons is not understood.\n  The fractal properties and discrete scale invariance model are also used to\nstudy nuclei yrast masses as well as excited nuclei level masses of some\nnuclei. Here also the good agreement between data and fractal property, allows\nto make some predictions for still unobserved nuclei masses.\n  Fractal properties are also compared to several nuclei data such as :\n  - atomic masses in several columns of the Mendeleev periodic table of\nelements,\n  - masses of series following $\\beta^{+}$ or $\\beta^{-}$ disintegrations,\n  - one and two nucleon separation energies,\n  - half-lives of some isotopes,\n  - the four radioactive family periods.\n  Finally, it is shown that the lepton, hadron, and boson masses can be\npresented in the same frame.

Neutron information is usually extracted from\ndata on nuclear targets such as deuterium, requiring corrections for nuclear\nbinding and nucleon off-shell effects. These corrections are model dependent\nand have significant uncertainties, especially for large values of the Bjorken\nscaling variable x. The Barely Off-shell Nucleon Structure (BONuS) experiment\nat Jefferson Lab measured the inelastic electron deuteron scattering cross\nsection, tagging spectator protons in coincidence with the scattered electrons.\nThis method reduces nuclear binding uncertainties significantly and has allowed\nfor the first time a (nearly) model independent extraction of the neutron\nstructure function. A novel compact radial time projection chamber was built to\ndetect protons with momentum between 70 and 150 MeV/c. For the extraction of\nthe free neutron structure function $F_{2n}$, spectator protons at backward\nangle and with momenta below 100 MeV/c were selected, ensuring that the\nscattering took place on a nearly free neutron.

These degeneracies cannot be broken by the CMB constraint on the\neffective number of neutrinos, N_eff. However, since big bang nucleosynthesis\n(BBN) is also affected by a light WIMP and equivalent neutrinos, complementary\nBBN and CMB constraints can break some of the degeneracy. In a previous paper\nBBN and CMB were combined to explore allowed ranges for m_chi, Delta N_nu, and\nN_eff for light WIMPs that annihilate electromagnetically (EM) to photons\nand/or electrons/positrons. In this paper BBN predictions with a light WIMP\nthat only couples to neutrinos are calculated. Recent observed abundances of\n^2H and ^4He are used to limit m_chi, Delta N_nu, N_eff, and the present-day\nbaryon density. Allowing for a neutrino coupled light WIMP and nonzero Delta\nN_nu, combined BBN and CMB data give lower limits to m_chi, with a best fit\nm_chi > 35 MeV, equivalent to no light WIMP at all. All masses below 4--9 MeV\n(depending on spin) are excluded. Without any light WIMP, BBN alone prefers\nDelta N_nu = 0.50 +- 0.23, favoring neither Delta N_nu = 0, nor a fully\nthermalized sterile neutrino (Delta N_nu = 1). This result is consistent with\nthe CMB constraint, N_eff = 3.30 +- 0.27, limiting \"new physics\" between BBN\nand recombination.

In general,\nthese models assume that hard process rates and the magnitude of the soft event\nactivity in the underlying $NN$ collisions is uncorrelated. When included,\nthese correlations influence the measured yield in a nominal centrality\ninterval, an effect typically referred to as a \"centrality bias\". In this work,\nthe impact of a positive correlation between the hard scattering yield and the\nunderlying event activity in individual $NN$ collisions is investigated. This\ncorrelation is incorporated into the centrality calculations used by ATLAS and\nPHENIX, both based on a similar Monte Carlo Glauber approach but with different\nmodels of the per-collision or per-participant event activity. It is found that\nthe presence of this correlation tends to increase the yield measured in more\ncentral events and decrease it in peripheral events.

Using a modified version of the\nevent generator PYTHIA, in conjunction with a nuclear Glauber Monte-Carlo event\ngenerator, we demonstrate how events with a hard jet may be simulated, in such\na way that the parton distribution function of the projectile nucleon is frozen\nduring its interaction with the extended nucleus.

Critical for this are the precision measurements\nof the fundamental properties of both electron and nuclear recoil tracks down\nto the lowest detectable energies. Such measurements are necessary to provide a\nbenchmark for background discrimination and directional sensitivity that could\nbe used for future optimization studies for directional dark matter\nexperiments. In this paper we describe a small, high resolution, high signal-\nto-noise GEM-based TPC with a 2D CCD readout designed for this goal. The\nperformance of the detector was characterized using alpha particles, X-rays,\ngamma-rays, and neutrons, enabling detailed measurements of electron and\nnuclear recoil tracks.

In an expansion in\npowers of $1/(N_c^2-1)$ and to leading order in the number of sources $N$, we\ncalculate interference effects in the $m$-particle spectra and we determine\nfrom them the second and fourth order cumulant momentum anisotropies $v_n$.\nWithout invoking any azimuthal asymmetry and any density dependent non-linear\ndynamics in the incoming state, and without invoking any interaction in the\nfinal state, we find that QCD interference alone can give rise to values for\n$v_n\\lbrace 2\\rbrace$ and $v_n\\lbrace 4\\rbrace$, $n$ even, that persist\nunattenuated for increasing number of sources, that may increase with\nincreasing multiplicity and that agree with measurements in proton-proton (pp)\ncollisions in terms of the order of magnitude of the signal and the approximate\nshape of the transverse momentum dependence. We further find that the\nnon-abelian features of QCD interference can give rise to odd harmonic\nanisotropies. These findings indicate that the no-interaction baseline\nincluding QCD interference effects can make a sizeable if not dominant\ncontribution to the measured $v_n$ coefficients in pp collisions. Prospects for\nanalyzing QCD interference contributions further and their possible relevance\nfor proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions are discussed shortly. \n\n"}

The OLYMPUS experiment collected more\nthan 3 fb$^{-1}$ of exclusive $e^- p$ and $e^+ p$ elastic scattering data at\nDESY in 2012, and has determined the elastic $\\sigma_{e^+p}/\\sigma_{e^-p}$\nratio to unprecedented precision up to $Q^2\\approx2.2$ (GeV/$c$)$^2$,\n$\\epsilon\\approx0.4$. This presentation will discuss the OLYMPUS experiment and\nanalysis, and present the recently published results from OLYMPUS in the\ncontext of the results from the other two TPE experiments. \n\n"}

The largest systematic error for the current neutrino oscillation\nmeasurements comes from the neutrino-nucleus interaction part, and its accurate\nunderstanding is essential for high-precision neutrino physics, namely for\nstudying CP violation in the lepton sector. Depending on neutrino beam\nenergies, quasi-elastic, resonance, Regge, or/and deep inelastic scattering\n(DIS) processes contribute to the neutrino cross section. It is desirable to\nhave a code to calculate the neutrino-nucleus cross section in any kinematical\nrange by combining various theoretical descriptions. On the other hand, the\nIceCube collaboration started obtaining cross section data up to the $10^{15}$\neV range, so that it became necessary to understand ultra-high-energy neutrino\ninteractions beyond the artificial lepton-accelerator energy range. For future\nprecise neutrino physics including the CP measurement, it is also necessary to\nunderstand accurate nuclear corrections. The current status is explained for\nnuclear corrections in DIS structure functions. The possibility is also\ndiscussed to find gravitational sources within nucleons and nuclei, namely\nmatrix elements of quark-gluon energy-momentum tensor.

Hence the use of\nforward-angle parity-violating $\\vec{e}p$ data with $\\nu p$ and $\\bar{\\nu} p$\ndata allows the extraction of all three strange form factors: electric,\nmagnetic and axial ($G_E^s$, $G_M^s$, and $G_A^s$). In this letter, $\\nu p$ and\n$\\bar{\\nu} p$ data from the Brookhaven E734 experiment are combined with the\nJefferson Lab HAPPEX $\\vec{e}p$ data to obtain two distinct solutions for the\nstrange form factors at $Q^2$ = 0.5 GeV$^2$. More generally, combining the\nneutrino elastic scattering data from E734 with the existing and upcoming\n$\\vec{e}p$ data will yield the strange form factors of the nucleon for $Q^2$ of\n0.45-1.05 GeV$^2$. Measurement of $G_A^s$ is crucial to the determination of\nthe strange quark contribution to the nucleon spin, $\\Delta s$. \n\n"}

The decay of a\nquasi-projectile has been identified; its excitation energy leads to a\nmultifragmentation totally described in terms of a statistical disassembly of a\nthermalized system (T$\\simeq$4 MeV, E$^*\\simeq$4 MeV/nucleon). Moreover, for\nthe systems Ni+Ni, Ni+Ag, in the same nuclear reaction, a source with velocity\nintermediate between that of the quasi-projectile and that of the quasi-target,\nemitting IMF, is observed.

This study is the first attempt to\ncomplete a systematic, consistent investigation of the elementary kaon\nproduction reactions for both the pion baryon and baryon baryon reactions. Our\nmodel suggests that the magnitudes of the isospin-averaged total cross sections\nfor the $N N \\to N Y K$ and $\\Delta N \\to N Y K$ ($Y = \\Lambda$ or $\\Sigma$)\nreactions are almost equal at energies up to about 200 MeV above threshold.\nHowever, the magnitudes for the $\\Delta N$ reactions become about 6 times\nlarger than those for the $N N$ reactions at energies about 1 GeV above\nthreshold.

Abstract: The centrality dependence of (multi-)strange hadron abundances is studied for\nPb(158 AGeV)Pb reactions and compared to p(158 GeV)Pb collisions. The\nmicroscopic transport model UrQMD is used for this analysis. The predicted\nLambda/pi-, Xi-/pi- and Omega-/pi- ratios are enhanced due to rescattering in\ncentral Pb-Pb collisions as compared to peripheral Pb-Pb or p-Pb collisions. A\nreduction of the constituent quark masses to the current quark masses m_s \\sim\n230 MeV, m_q \\sim 10 MeV, as motivated by chiral symmetry restoration, enhances\nthe hyperon yields to the experimentally observed high values. Similar results\nare obtained by an ad hoc overall increase of the color electric field strength\n(effective string tension of kappa=3 GeV/fm). The enhancement depends strongly\non the kinematical cuts. The maximum enhancement is predicted around\nmidrapidity. For Lambda's, strangeness suppression is predicted at\nprojectile/target rapidity. For Omega's, the predicted enhancement can be as\nlarge as one order of magnitude. Comparisons of Pb-Pb data to proton induced\nasymmetric (p-A) collisions are hampered due to the predicted strong asymmetry\nin the various rapidity distributions of the different (strange) particle\nspecies. In p-Pb collisions, strangeness is locally (in rapidity) not\nconserved. The present comparison to the data of the WA97 and NA49\ncollaborations clearly supports the suggestion that conventional (free)\nhadronic scenarios are unable to describe the observed high (anti-)hyperon\nyields in central collisions. The doubling of the strangeness to nonstrange\nsuppression factor, gamma_s \\approx 0.65, might be interpreted as a signal of a\nphase of nearly massless particles. \n\n"}

The signal\nshould be observable even if multiple domains of D$\\chi$C form provided the\naverage number of pions per domain is significantly larger than unity. The\nvariance of the number charged pions alone provides a signal which can be used\neven if the number of neutral pions cannot be measured in a given detector. On\nthe other hand, the probability distribution in $R$, the proportion of neutral\npions to all pions emitted in heavy ion collisions in certain kinematic\nregions, has been suggested as a signal of a disoriented chiral condensate.\nHere we note that the signature can be greatly enhanced by making suitable cuts\nin the data. In particular, we consider reducing the data set such that the $k$\npions with lowest $p_T$ are all neutral. We find that, given such cuts, $<R>$\ncan be substantially different from 1/3. For example, for a single D$\\chi$C\ndomain without contamination due to incoherently emitted pions, $<R>$ is 3/5\ngiven the pion with lowest $p_T$ is neutral, and 5/7 given the two pions with\nlowest $p_T$ are both neutral, {\\it etc.}.
