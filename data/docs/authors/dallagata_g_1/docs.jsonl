{"id": "0704.1447", "contents": "Title: Can Gravity Probe B usefully constrain torsion gravity theories? Abstract: In most theories of gravity involving torsion, the source for torsion is the\nintrinsic spin of matter. Since the spins of fermions are normally randomly\noriented in macroscopic bodies, the torsion generated is normally negligible.\nHowever, in a recent paper, Mao et al. point out that there is a class of\ntheories in which the angular momentum of macroscopic spinning bodies generates\na significant amount of torsion. They argue that by the principle of action\nequals reaction, one would expect the angular momentum of test bodies to couple\nto a background torsion field, and therefore the precession of the GPB\ngyroscopes should be affected in these theories by the torsion generated by the\nEarth. We show that in fact the principle of action equals reaction does not\napply to these theories. We examine in detail a generalization of the\nHayashi-Shirafuji theory suggested by Mao et al. called\nEinstein-Hayashi-Shirafuji theory. There are a variety of different versions of\nthis theory, depending on the precise form of the coupling to matter chosen for\nthe torsion. We show that for any coupling to matter that is compatible with\nthe spin transport equation postulated by Mao et al., the theory has either\nghosts or an ill-posed initial value formulation. These theoretical problems\ncan be avoided by specializing the parameters of the theory and in addition\nchoosing the standard minimal coupling to matter of the torsion tensor. This\nyields a consistent theory, but one in which the action equals reaction\nprinciple is violated, and in which the angular momentum of the gyroscopes does\nnot couple to the Earth's torsion field. Thus, the Einstein-Hayashi-Shirafuji\ntheory does not predict a detectable torsion signal for Gravity Probe B. There\nmay be other torsion theories which do. \n\n"}

An\ninterference term between the opposite chiralities (helicities) states is\nrequired in order to obtain the expected result. The so called soldering\nprocedure provides the missing interference Lagrangian in both 2D and 3D cases.\nIn two dimensions such interference term allows to fuse two chiral fermionic\ndeterminants into a nonchiral one. In a recent work we have generalized this\nprocedure by allowing the appearance of an extra parameter which takes two\npossible values and leads to two different soldered Lagrangians. Here we apply\nthis generalized soldering in a bosonic theory which has appeared in a partial\nbosonization of the 3D gauged Thirring with $N$ flavors. The multiplicity of\nflavors allow new types of solderings and help us to understand the connection\nbetween different perturbative approaches to bosonization in 3D.

It was conjectured by Seiberg and Shih\nthat all branes in a minimal string theory could be expressed as a linear\ncombination of the brane associated to the identity operator of the minimal\nmodel with complex shifts in the boundary cosmological constant. Subsequently\nit was found that this identification of FZZT branes does not hold exactly for\nsome cylinder amplitudes but was spoiled by terms that are associated with\nvanishing worldsheet area and are therefore non-universal. In this paper we\ninvestigate this claim systematically, using both Liouville and matrix model\nmethods, beyond the planar limit. We find that the aforementioned\nidentification of FZZT branes is spoiled by terms that do not admit an\ninterpretation as non-universal terms. Furthermore, the spoiling terms as\ncomputed using the matrix model are found to be in agreement with those coming\nfrom Liouville theory, which also suggests that these terms have universal\nmeaning. Finally, we also investigate the identification of FZZT branes by\nreplacing the boundary state with a sum of local operators.

To be more precise, the coefficients appearing\nin the Lovelock expansion are fixed by requiring the theory to have a unique\nAdS vacuum with a fixed value of the cosmological constant. This yields to\nk=1,2,...,[(D-1)/2] inequivalent possible gravity theories; here the case k=1\ncorresponds to the standard Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian. For each par (D,k), we\nderive two classes of AdS black hole solutions with planar event horizon\ntopology for particular values of the nonminimal coupling parameter. The first\nfamily of solutions depends on a unique constant and is valid only for k>1. In\nfact, its GR counterpart k=1 reduces to the pure AdS metric with a vanishing\nscalar field. The second family of solutions involves two independent constants\nand corresponds to a stealth black hole configuration; that is a nontrivial\nscalar field together with a black hole metric such that both side of the\nEinstein equations (gravity and matter parts) vanishes identically. In this\ncase, the standard GR case k=1 reduces to the Schwarzschild-AdS-Tangherlini\nblack hole metric with a trivial scalar field.

This paper is\ndevoted to matter couplings in such supergravity models. We show how in the new\nminimal formalism matter coupling presents certain features absent in other\nformalisms.

The supergravity corrections to the potential\nprovide strong field stabilizations for the scalars except inflaton, therefore\nthe helical phase inflation accomplishes the \"monodromy inflation\" within\nsupersymmetric field theory.\n  The phase monodromy can be easily generalized for natural inflation, in which\nthe super-Planckian phase decay constant is realized with consistent field\nstabilization.

Energy-momentum is just a term\nproportional to the field equations and a 'curl' term with identically zero\ndivergence.

The main purpose of this paper is to attempt\nto lay to rest the ``Nernst theorem'' as a law of thermodynamics. We consider a\nboson (or fermion) ideal gas with its total angular momentum, $J$, as an\nadditional state parameter, and we analyze the conditions on the single\nparticle density of states, $g(\\epsilon,j)$, needed for the Nernst formulation\nof the third law to hold. (Here, $\\epsilon$ and $j$ denote the single particle\nenergy and angular momentum.) Although it is shown that the Nernst formulation\nof the third law does indeed hold under a wide range of conditions, some simple\nclasses of examples of densities of states which violate the ``Nernst theorem''\nare given. In particular, at zero temperature, a boson (or fermion) gas\nconfined to a circular string (whose energy is proportional to its length) not\nonly violates the ``Nernst theorem'' also but reproduces some other\nthermodynamic properties of an extremal rotating black hole. \n\n"}

This class includes the\nHeterotic M-theory brane-world of Refs. \\cite{ovrut,ekpy} and the\nRandall-Sundrum (RS) model as a limiting case. In general, there are two moduli\nfields $y_{\\pm}$, corresponding to the \"positions\" of two branes (which live at\nthe fixed points of an orbifold compactification). Classically, the moduli are\nmassless, due to a scaling symmetry of the action. However, in the absence of\nsupersymmetry, they develop an effective potential at one loop. Local terms\nproportional to $K_\\pm^4$, where $K_\\pm=q/y_\\pm$ is the local curvature scale\nat the location of the corresponding brane, are needed in order to remove the\ndivergences in the effective potential. Such terms break the scaling symmetry\nand hence they may act as stabilizers for the moduli. When the branes are very\nclose to each other, the effective potential induced by massless bulk fields\nbehaves like $V\\sim d^{-4}$, where $d$ is the separation between branes.

For a tachyon\npotential $V(T)\\sim M_{Pl}^4\\exp(-T/\\tau)$, the tachyon must start rolling at\n$T\\simeq 60\\tau$ in order for the density of tachyon matter today to satisfy\n$\\Omega_{T,0}\\sim 1$, provided that standard big bang cosmology begins at the\nsame time as the tachyon begins to roll. In this case, the value of\n$\\Omega_{T,0}$ is exponentially sensitive to $T/\\tau$ at the onset of rolling,\nso smaller $T/\\tau$ is unacceptable, and larger $T/\\tau$ implies a tachyon\ndensity that is too small to have interesting cosmological effects.
