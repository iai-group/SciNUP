For n<=20 we provide simple analytic fitting\nformulae to describe the non-resonant part of the two-photon emission profiles.\nCombining these with the analytic form of the cascade-term yields a simple and\naccurate description of the full two-photon decay spectrum, which only involves\na sum over a few intermediate states. We demonstrate that the cascade term\nnaturally leads to a nearly Lorentzian shape of the two-photon profiles in the\nvicinity of the resonances. However, due to quantum-electrodynamical\ncorrections, the two-photon emission spectra deviate significantly from the\nLorentzian shape in the very distant wings of the resonances. We investigate up\nto which distance the two-photon profiles are close to a Lorentzian and discuss\nthe role of the interference term. We then analyze how the deviation of the\ntwo-photon profiles from the Lorentzian shape affects the dynamics of\ncosmological hydrogen recombination. Since in this context the escape of\nphotons from the Lyman-alpha resonance plays a crucial role, we concentrate on\nthe two-photon corrections in the vicinity of the Lyman-alpha line.

An ultracold\nmolecular gas, with a temperature below 1 uK, provides a highly unusual regime\nfor chemistry, where polar molecules can easily be oriented using an external\nelectric field and where, moreover, the motion of two colliding molecules is\nstrictly quantized. Recently, atom-exchange reactions were observed in a\ntrapped ultracold gas of KRb molecules. In an external electric field, these\nexothermic and barrierless bimolecular reactions, KRb+KRb -> K2+Rb2, occur at a\nrate that rises steeply with increasing dipole moment. Here we show that the\nquantum stereodynamics of the ultracold collisions can be exploited to suppress\nthe bimolecular chemical reaction rate by nearly two orders of magnitude. We\nuse an optical lattice trap to confine the fermionic polar molecules in a\nquasi-two-dimensional, pancake-like geometry, with the dipoles oriented along\nthe tight confinement direction.

In atomic systems, where interactions\nrequire wave function overlap, effective spin interactions on a lattice can be\nrealized via superexchange; however, the coupling is weak and limited to\nnearest-neighbor interactions.

We review some of the rich literature on this subject, with a\nfocus on more recent non-standard forms of the Hubbard model. After an\nintroduction to standard (fermionic and bosonic) Hubbard models, we discuss\nbriefly common models for mixtures, as well as the so called extended\nBose-Hubbard models, that include interactions between neighboring sites,\nnext-neighboring sites, and so on. The main part of the review discusses the\nimportance of additional terms appearing when refining the tight-binding\napproximation on the original physical Hamiltonian. Even when restricting the\nmodels to the lowest Bloch band is justified, the standard approach neglects\nthe density-induced tunneling (which has the same origin as the usual on-site\ninteraction). The importance of these contributions is discussed for both\ncontact and dipolar interactions.

Here, for the first time, in the framework of a\ncluster MF treatment, we extract the signature of EE in the bosonic\nsuperfluid-insulator transitions. We consider a trimerized Kagome lattice of\ninteracting bosons, in which each trimer is treated as a cluster, and implement\nthe cluster MF treatment by decoupling all inter-trimer hopping. In addition to\nsuperfluid and integer insulator phases, we find that fractional insulator\nphases appear when the tunneling is dominated by the intra-trimer part.

Here we report the observation of signatures of such a\nnon-equilibrium phase transition in an open driven quantum system. In our\nexperiment rubidium atoms in a quasi one-dimensional cold disordered gas are\nlaser-excited to Rydberg states under so-called facilitation conditions.

On the other hand, time-dependent density functional theory\n(TDDFT) tells us that the single-particle density is, in principle, sufficient.\nHowever, a practicable equation of motion (EOM) for the accurate time evolution\nof the single-particle density is unknown. It is thus an obvious idea to\npropagate a quantity which is not as reduced as the single-particle density but\nless dimensional than the $N$-body wavefunction. Recently, we have introduced\ntime-dependent renormalized-natural-orbital theory (TDRNOT). TDRNOT is based on\nthe propagation of the eigenfunctions of the one-body reduced density matrix\n(1-RDM), the so-called natural orbitals. In this paper we demonstrate how\nTDRNOT is related to the multi-configurational time-dependent Hartree-Fock\n(MCTDHF) approach.

Cold\natoms behave not only as the single-particle nonlinear oscillators, but also as\nthe coupled oscillators by the light-induced inter-atomic interaction, which\nleads to the phase transitions far from equilibrium in a way similar to the\nphase transition in equilibrium.

They\ncause dynamic arrest associated with highly-constrained many-body\nconfigurations, leading to slow relaxation and glassy behavior. Multi-component\nRydberg gases feature additional long-range interactions such as\nexcitation-exchange. These are analogous to particle swaps used to artificially\naccelerate relaxation in simulations of atomistic models of classical glass\nformers. In Rydberg gases, however, swaps are real physical processes, which\nprovide dynamical shortcuts to relaxation. They permit the accelerated approach\nto stationarity in experiment and at the same time have an impact on the\nnon-equilibrium stationary state. In particular their interplay with radiative\ndecay processes amplifies irreversibility of the dynamics, an effect which we\nquantify via the entropy production at stationarity. Our work highlights an\nintriguing analogy between real dynamical processes in Rydberg gases and\nartificial dynamics underlying advanced Monte Carlo methods. Moreover, it\ndelivers a quantitative characterization of the dramatic effect swaps have on\nthe structure and dynamics of their stationary state. \n\n"}

To this end, we introduce a\nminimal two-body Hamiltonian depending on just five measurable parameters of a\nFeshbach resonance, which accurately determines all low energy binary\nscattering observables, in particular, the molecular conversion efficiency of\njust two atoms. Based on this description of the microscopic collision\nphenomena, we use the many-body theory of T. Koehler and K. Burnett [Phys.

The key quantity\nto settle these questions is the ionization probability, for which hitherto no\ncomputational method exists which is entirely agreed upon. It is therefore very\nuseful to provide various consistency criteria which have to be satisfied by\nthis quantity, whose discussion is the main objective of this contribution. We\nshow how the scaling behaviour of the space leads to a symmetry in the\nionization probability, which can be exploited in the mentioned sense.\nFurthermore, we discuss how upper and lower bounds may be used for the same\npurpose. Rather than concentrating on particular analytical expressions we\nobtained elsewhere for these bounds, we focus in our discussion on the general\nprinciples of this method. We illustrate the precise working of this procedure,\nits advantages, shortcomings and range of applicability. We show that besides\nconstraining possible values for the ionization probability these bounds, like\nthe scaling behaviour, also lead to definite statements concerning the physical\noutcome. The pulse shape properties which have to be satitisfied for the\nexistence of asymptotical stabilization is the vanishing of the total classical\nmomentum transfer and the total classical displacement and not smoothly\nswitched on and off pulses. Alternatively we support our results by general\nconsiderations in the Gordon-Volkov perturbation theory and explicit studies of\nvarious pulse shapes and potentials including in particular the Coulomb- and\nthe delta potential. \n\n"}

The Dirac equation, in the case of electromagnetic interaction,\nis not invariant under unitary time inversion, giving rise to a ``Klein\nparadox''. To render unitary time inversion invariance, a nonlinear wave\nequation is constructed, in which the ``Klein paradox'' disappears. In the case\nof Coulomb interaction, the revised nonlinear equation can be linearized to\ngive energy solutions for Hydrogen-like ions without singularity when nuclear\nnumber $Z>137$, showing a reversed energy order pending for experimental tests\nsuch as Zeeman effects.
