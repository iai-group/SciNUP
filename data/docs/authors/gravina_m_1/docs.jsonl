Building on previously\nobtained results for Green functions in the Yang-Mills sector we analytically\nderive the existence of power-law infrared singularities for this vertex. We\nestablish that dynamical chiral symmetry breaking leads to the self-consistent\ngeneration of components of the quark-gluon vertex forbidden when chiral\nsymmetry is forced to stay in the Wigner-Weyl mode. In the latter case the\nrunning strong coupling assumes an infrared fixed point. If chiral symmetry is\nbroken, either dynamically or explicitely, the running coupling is infrared\ndivergent. Based on a truncation for the quark-gluon vertex Dyson-Schwinger\nequation which respects the analytically determined infrared behavior numerical\nresults for the coupled system of the quark propagator and vertex\nDyson-Schwinger equation are presented. The resulting quark mass function as\nwell as the vertex function show only a very weak dependence on the current\nquark mass in the deep infrared. From this we infer by an analysis of the\nquark-quark scattering kernel a linearly rising quark potential with an almost\nmass independent string tension in the case of broken chiral symmetry.\nEnforcing chiral symmetry does lead to a Coulomb type potential. Therefore we\nconclude that chiral symmetry breaking and confinement are closely related.\nFurthermore we discuss aspects of confinement as the absence of long-range\nvan-der-Waals forces and Casimir scaling.

However due to the Z-Z' mixing\nalso corresponding contributions from Z boson are present that are usually\nneglected. We calculate the impact of these contributions on Delta F=2\nprocesses and rare K, B_s and B_d decays for different values of a parameter\nbeta, which distinguishes between various 331 models and for different fermion\nrepresentations under the SU(3)_L group. We find a general expression for the\nZ-Z' mixing in terms beta, M_Z, M_Z' and tan(bar{beta}), familiar from 2 Higgs\nDoublet models, that differs from the one quoted in the literature. We study in\nparticular the models with beta=+-n/sqrt{3} with n=1,2 which have recently been\ninvestigated by us in the context of new data on B_{s,d}->mu^+ mu^- and\nB_d->K^*(K)mu^+ mu^-. We find that these new contributions can indeed be\nneglected in the case of Delta F=2 transitions and decays, like\nB_d->K^*mu^+mu^-, where they are suppressed by the small vectorial Z coupling\nto charged leptons. However the contributions of tree-level Z exchanges to\ndecays sensitive to axial-vector couplings, like B_{s,d}->mu^+ mu^- and B_d->K\nmu^+ mu^-, and those with neutrinos in the final state, like b->s nu bar{nu}\ntransitions, K^+->pi^+ nu bar{nu} and K_L->pi^0 nu bar{nu} cannot be generally\nneglected with size of Z contributions depending on beta, tan(bar{beta}) and\nM_Z'.

We first provide a\nLorentz decomposition of the HLbL tensor performed according to the general\nrecipe by Bardeen, Tung, and Tarrach, generalizing and extending our previous\napproach, which was constructed in terms of a basis of helicity amplitudes.\nSuch a tensor decomposition has several advantages: the role of gauge\ninvariance and crossing symmetry becomes fully transparent; the scalar\ncoefficient functions are free of kinematic singularities and zeros, and thus\nfulfill a Mandelstam double-dispersive representation; and the explicit\nrelation for the HLbL contribution to $(g-2)_\\mu$ in terms of the coefficient\nfunctions simplifies substantially.

There are no\nmassive gluons, but only hadron-like bound states of sigma-model particles. The\nreason is that the gluon mass diverges, being proportional to the two-point\ncorrelation function of the renormalized field of the sigma model at $x=0$. We\nuse exact large-$N$ results to show that after introducing a lattice\nregularization and typical values of the coupling constants used in Monte Carlo\nsimulations, the gluon mass becomes finite, and even sometimes small.

The resulting finite volume effects must be\nquantitatively understood; and, to this end, non-relativistic effective field\ntheories are an efficient tool, especially in the case of composite particles.\nRecently an oddity related to non-locality of the standard lattice approach was\nuncovered by the Budapest-Marseille-Wuppertal collaboration.

We discuss the applicable parameter range of the reweighting method for\nmodels which have more than one simulation parameter. The applicability range\nis determined by the fluctuations of the modification factor of the Boltzmann\nweight. In some models having a first order phase transition, the fluctuations\nare minimized along the phase transition line if we assume that the pressure in\nthe hot and the cold phase is balanced at the first order phase transition\npoint. This suggests that the reweighting method with two parameters is\napplicable in a wide range for the purpose of tracing out the phase transition\nline in the parameter space. To confirm the usefulness of the reweighting\nmethod for 2 flavor QCD, the fluctuations of the reweighting factor are\nmeasured by numerical simulations for the cases of reweighting in the quark\nmass and chemical potential directions.

Part I Abstract: We show that the QCD vacuum (without dynamical quarks) is a dual\nsuperconductor at least in the low-energy region in the sense that monopole\ncondensation does really occur. In fact, we derive the dual Ginzburg-Landau\ntheory (i.e., dual Abelian Higgs model) directly from the SU(2) Yang-Mills\ntheory by adopting the maximal Abelian gauge. The dual superconductor can be on\nthe border between type II and type I, excluding the London limit. The masses\nof the dual Abelian gauge field is expressed by the Yang-Mills gauge coupling\nconstant and the mass of the off-diagonal gluon of the original Yang-Mills\ntheory. Moreover, we can rewrite the Yang-Mills theory into an theory written\nin terms of the Abelian magnetic monopole alone at least in the low-energy\nregion.
