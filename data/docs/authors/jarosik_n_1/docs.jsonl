Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on\nthe role that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in\nglobular clusters, e.g., influencing the distribution of horizontal branch\nstars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of some globular clusters, and in\nforming low mass white dwarfs. \n\n"}

We also present estimates of the fraction of cores in the\n\"prestellar\", \"stellar'', and \"failed\" (those cores that redisperse back into\nthe environment) stages as a function of n_thr. The number ratios are measured\nindirectly in the simulations due to their resolution limitations. Our approach\ncontains one free parameter, the lifetime of a protostellar object t_yso (Class\n0 + Class I stages), which is outside the realm of the simulations. Assuming a\nvalue t_yso = 0.46 Myr, we obtain number ratios of starless to stellar cores\nranging from 4-5 at n_thr = 1.5 x 10^4 cm^-3 to 1 at n_thr = 1.2 x 10^5 cm^-3,\nagain in good agreement with observational determinations.

The galaxy is known to possess a dramatic 70 kpc\nX-ray tail. The detected H-alpha tail coincides positionally with the X-ray\ntail. The H-alpha emission in the galaxy is sharply truncated on the front and\nthe sides near the nucleus, indicating significant ram pressure stripping. ESO\n137-001 is thus the first cluster late-type galaxy known unambiguously with\nboth an X-ray tail and an H-alpha tail. The emission-line objects are all\ndistributed downstream of the galaxy, with projected distance up to 39 kpc from\nthe galaxy. From the analysis on the H-alpha_{off} frame and the estimate of\nthe background emission-line objects, we conclude that it is very likely all 29\nemission-line objects are HII regions in A3627.

This model differs\nfrom traditional models of supernova debris interacting with external CSM in\nthat here the shell is optically thick and the escape of radiation is delayed.\nWe show that any model attempting to account for SN2006gy's huge luminosity\nwith radiation emitted by ongoing CSM interaction fails for the following basic\nreason: the CSM density required to achieve the observed luminosity makes the\nsame circumstellar envelope opaque, forcing a thermal diffusion solution.

If the thickness of the front can be measured, it can provide a\nnovel constraint on the ionizing spectral energy distribution (SED). Here we\nfollow the propagation of an I-front into a uniform IGM, and compute its\nthickness for a range of possible quasar spectra and ages. We also explore the\neffects of uniform and non-uniform ionizing backgrounds. We find that even for\nhard spectra, the fronts are initially thin, with a thickness much smaller than\nthe mean free path of ionizing photons, but the thickness increases as the\nfront approaches equilibrium in 10^8 - 10^9 years, and can eventually\nsignificantly exceed simple estimates based on the mean free path. With a high\nintrinsic hydrogen column density obscuring the source (log(N_H/cm^-2) >~ 19.2)\nor a hard power-law spectrum combined with some obscuration (e.g.\ndlog(F_\\nu)/dlog(\\nu) >~ -1.2 at log(N_H/cm^-2) >~ 18.0), the thickness of the\nfront exceeds ~1 physical Mpc and may be measurable from the morphology of its\nredshifted 21cm signal.

Abstract: Standard calculations suggest that the entropy of our universe is dominated\nby black holes, whose entropy is of order their area in Planck units, although\nthey comprise only a tiny fraction of its total energy.

Therefore, assuming unitarity in black hole evaporation, the\nstandard results suggest that the largest uncertainty in the future quantum\nstate of the universe is due to the Hawking radiation from evaporating black\nholes. However, the entropy of the matter precursors to astrophysical black\nholes is enormously less than that given by area entropy.

It is difficult for feedback from near the\naccretion disk to directly impact dense molecular clouds at ~kpc. But if such\nfeedback can drive a weak wind or outflow in the hot, diffuse ISM (a relatively\n'easy' task), then in the wake of such an outflow passing over a cold cloud, a\ncombination of instabilities will drive the cloud material to effectively\nexpand in the direction perpendicular to the outflow. Such expansion\ndramatically increases the effective cross section of the cloud material and\nmakes it more susceptible to ionization and momentum coupling from absorption\nof the incident quasar radiation field. Even a moderate effect of this nature\ncan dramatically alter the ability of clouds at large radii to be fully ionized\nand driven into a secondary outflow by radiation pressure. Since the amount of\nmomentum and volume which can be ionized by observed quasar radiation field is\nmore than sufficient to affect the entire cold gas supply once it has been\naltered in this manner (and the 'initial' feedback need only initiate a\nmoderate wind in the low-density hot gas), this reduces by an order of\nmagnitude the required energy budget for feedback to affect a host galaxy.\nInstead of ~5% of the radiated energy (~100% momentum) needed if the initial\nfeedback must directly heat or blow out the galactic gas, if only ~0.5% of the\nluminosity (~10% momentum) can couple to drive the initial hot outflow, this\nmechanism could be efficient.

In the homogeneous and isotropic\nbackground, we show that, although the dark-spinor (Elko) condensate leads to\nthe identical acceleration equation as that of the canonical scalar field\ndriven inflation, the dynamics of the two models are different. In the\nslow-roll limit, we show that the model, predicts a running of scalar spectral\nindex consistent with the WMAP data. We show that the consistency relations\nbetween the spinor condensate and canonical scalar field driven model are\ndifferent which can be tested using the future CMB and gravitational wave\nmissions. \n\n"}

We calculate the\nheat capacity for such a quark star, and the results show that the residual\nthermal energy cannot sustain the observed thermal X-ray luminosities seen in\ntypical isolated X-ray pulsars. We conclude that other heating mechanisms must\nbe in operation if the pulsars are in fact solid quark stars. Two possible\nheating mechanisms are explored. Firstly, for pulsars with little\nmagnetospheric activities, accretion from the interstellar medium or from the\nmaterial in the associated supernova remnants may power the observed thermal\nemission. In the propeller regime, a disk-accretion rate ${\\dot M}\\sim$1% of\nthe Eddington rate with an accretion onto the stellar surface at a rate of\n$\\sim 0.1% {\\dot M}$ could explain the observed emission luminosities of the\ndim isolated neutron stars and the central compact objects. Secondly, for\npulsars with significant magnetospheric activities, the pulsar spindown\nluminosities may have been as the sources of the thermal energy via reversing\nplasma current flows. A phenomenological study between pulsar bolometric X-ray\nluminosities and the spin energy loss rates presents the probable existence of\na 1/2-law or a linear law, i.e. $L_{\\rm bol}^{\\infty}\\propto\\dot{E}^{1/2}$ or\n$L_{\\rm bol}^{\\infty}\\propto\\dot{E}$.

The electro-magnetic configuration\nforming the RCS incorporates all three components of the magnetic field\n(including the guiding field) and a drifted electric field. PIC simulations\nreveal that there is a polarisation electric field that appears during\nacceleration owing to a separation of electrons from protons towards the\nmidplane of the RCS. If the plasma density is low, the polarisation field is\nweak and the particle trajectories in the PIC simulations are similar to those\nin the test particle (TP) approach. For the higher plasma density the\npolarisation field is stronger and it affects the trajectories of protons by\nincreasing their orbits during acceleration. This field also leads to a less\nasymmetrical abundances of ejected protons towards the midplane in comparison\nwith the TP approach. For a given magnetic topology electrons in PIC\nsimulations are ejected to the same semispace as protons, contrary to the TP\nresults. This happens because the polarisation field extends far beyond the\nthickness of a current sheet.

The S/N ratio is sufficiently high that we\ncan extend previous studies to smaller equivalent widths (typically Wr>0.3A).\nOver a pathlength of Delta(z)~14 the number of weak absorbers detected is\nsimilar along GRB and QSO lines of sight, while the number of strong systems is\nlarger along GRB lines of sight with a 2-sigma significance. Using intermediate\nand low resolution observations reported in the literature, we increase the\nabsorption length for strong systems to Delta(z)=31.5 (about twice the path\nlength of previous studies) and find that the number density of strong MgII\nsystems is a factor of 2.1+/-0.6 higher (about 3-sigma significance) toward\nGRBs as compared to QSOs, about twice smaller however than previously reported.\nWe divide the sample in three redshift bins and we find that the number density\nof strong MgII is larger in the low redshift bins. We investigate in detail the\nproperties of strong MgII systems observed with UVES. Both the estimated dust\nextinction in strong GRB MgII systems and the equivalent width distribution are\nconsistent with what is observed for standard QSO systems. We find also that\nthe number density of (sub)-DLAs per unit redshift in the UVES sample is\nprobably twice larger than what is expected from QSO sightlines which confirms\nthe peculiarity of GRB lines of sight.

If the vector field remains light at the end of inflation it is found\nthat it can generate substantial statistical anisotropy in the spectrum and\nbispectrum of the curvature perturbation.

We have confirmed that there is a correlation between the X-ray\nluminosity corresponding to the hard-to-soft transition and the X-ray\nluminosity of the following soft state. This correlation holds over a\nluminosity range spanning by two orders of magnitude, with no indication of a\nflux saturation or cut-off. We have also found that the transition luminosity\ncorrelates with the rate of increase in the X-ray luminosity during the rising\nphase of an outburst or flare, implying that the origin of the variation of the\ntransition luminosity is associated with non-stationary accretion in both\ntransient sources and persistent sources. The correlation between the\nluminosity corresponding to the end of the soft-to-hard transition and the peak\nluminosity of the preceding soft state is found insignificant. The results\nsuggest that the hysteresis effect of spectral state transitions is primarily\ndriven by non-stationary accretion when the mass accretion rate increases\nrather than the mass accretion rate decreases. Our results also imply that\nGalactic X-ray binaries can reach more luminous hard states during outbursts of\nhigher luminosities and of similar rise time scales as those observed. Based on\nthe correlations, we speculate that bright hard state beyond the Eddington\nluminosity will be observed in Galactic binaries in the next century.

Although dust\ndestruction could be a cause, at least in part, for the large N_{H,X}/Av\nratios, the good fit provided by the SMC extinction law for the majority of our\nsample suggests that there is an abundance of small dust grains in the GRB\nenvironment, which we would expect to have been destroyed if dust destruction\nwere responsible for the large N_{H,X}/Av ratios. Instead, our analysis\nsuggests that the distribution of N_{H,X}/Av in GRB host galaxies may be mostly\nintrinsic to these galaxies, and this is further substantiated by evidence for\na strong negative correlation between N_{H,X}/Av and metallicity for a\nsubsample of GRB hosts with known metallicity. Furthermore, we find the\nN_{H,X}/Av ratio and metallicity for this subsample of GRBs to be comparable to\nthe relation found in other more metal-rich galaxies. \n\n"}

The\nrelevance and gauge equivalence of the clock synchronization conventions for\nthe identification of the instantaneous 3-spaces (Euclidean only in inertial\nframes) are described. Then this formalism is applied to tetrad gravity in\nglobally hyperbolic, asymptotically Minkowskian space-times without\nsuper-translations, where the equivalence principle implies the absence of\nglobal inertial frames. The recently discovered York canonical basis,\ndiagonalizing the York-Lichnerowicz approach, allows to identify the gauge\nvariables (inertial effects in general relativity) and the tidal ones (the\ngravitational waves of the linearized theory) and to clarify the meaning of the\nHamilton equations. The role of the gauge variable ${}^3K$, the trace of the\nextrinsic curvature of the non-Euclidean 3-space (the York time not existing in\nNewton theory), as a source of inertial effects is emphasized. After the\npresentation of preliminary results on the linearization of tetrad gravity in\nthe family of non-harmonic 3-orthogonal gauges with a free value of ${}^3K$, we\ndefine post-Minkowskian gravitational waves (without post-Newtonian\napproximations on the matter sources) propagating in a non-Euclidean 3-space,\nemphasizing the non-graviton-like aspects of gravity.

With half-light radii of r_h=4'.6 +- 0'.8 (206 +- 36 pc) and\nr_h=2'.6 +- 0'.6 (133 +- 31 pc), respectively, they are now well within the\nphysical size bracket of typical Milky Way dSph satellites. Their ellipticities\nof epsilon ~0.5 are shared by many faint (M_V>-8) Milky Way dSphs. The large\nspatial extent of our survey allows us to search for extra-tidal features with\nunprecedented sensitivity. The spatial distribution of candidate red giant\nbranch and horizontal branch stars is found to be non-uniform at the ~3 sigma\nlevel. This substructure is aligned along the direction connecting the two\nsystems, indicative of a possible `bridge' of extra-tidal material. Fitting the\nstellar distribution with a linear Gaussian model yields a significance of 4\nsigma for this overdensity, a most likely FWHM of ~16 arcmin and a central\nsurface brightness of ~32 mag arcsec^{-2}. We investigate different scenarios\nto explain the close proximity of Leo IV and Leo V and the possible tidal\nbridge between them. Orbit calculations demonstrate that they are unlikely to\nbe remnants of a single disrupted progenitor, while a comparison with\ncosmological simulations shows that a chance collision between unrelated\nsubhalos is negligibly small.

The spectral coverage of X-shooter allows us to search for\nnot only Lyman-alpha emission, but also rest-frame optical emission lines. We\nhave chosen DLAs where the strongest rest-frame optical lines ([OII], [OIII],\nHbeta and Halpha) fall in the NIR atmospheric transmission bands. In this first\npaper resulting from the survey, we report on the discovery of the galaxy\ncounterpart of the z_abs = 2.354 DLA towards the z=2.926 quasar Q2222$-0946.\nThis DLA is amongst the most metal-rich z>2 DLAs studied so far at comparable\nredshifts and there is evidence for substantial depletion of refractory\nelements onto dust grains. We measure metallicities from ZnII, SiII, NiII, MnII\nand FeII of -0.46+/-0.07, -0.51+/-0.06, -0.85+/-0.06, -1.23+/-0.06, and\n-0.99+/-0.06, respectively. The galaxy is detected in the Lyman-alpha, [OIII]\nlambda4959,5007 Halpha emission lines at an impact parameter of about 0.8\narcsec (6 kpc at z_abs = 2.354). We infer a star-formation rate of 10 M_sun\nyr^-1, which is a lower limit due to the possibility of slit-loss. Compared to\nthe recently determined Halpha luminosity function for z=2.2 galaxies the\nDLA-galaxy counterpart has a luminosity of L~0.1L^*_Halpha. The emission-line\nratios are 4.0 (Lyalpha/Halpha) and 1.2 ([OIII]/Halpha). The Lyalpha line shows\nclear evidence for resonant scattering effects, namely an asymmetric,\nredshifted (relative to the systemic redshift) component and a much weaker\nblueshifted component. The fact that the blueshifted component is relatively\nweak indicates the presence of a galactic wind. The properties of the galaxy\ncounterpart of this DLA is consistent with the prediction that metal-rich DLAs\nare associated with the most luminous of the DLA-galaxy counterparts. \n\n"}

I study the\nkinematics of clumpy galaxies at z~0.6, and compare their properties with those\nof counterparts at higher and lower redshifts. I selected a sample of 11 clumpy\ngalaxies at z~0.6 from the representative sample of emission line,\nintermediate-mass galaxies IMAGES. Selection was based on rest-frame UV\nmorphology from HST/ACS images, mimicking the selection criteria commonly used\nat higher redshifts. Their spatially-resolved kinematics were derived in the\nframe of the IMAGES survey, using the VLT/FLAMES-GIRAFFE multi-integral field\nspectrograph. For those showing large-scale rotation, I derived the Toomre Q\nparameter, which characterizes the stability of their gaseous and stellar\nphases. I find that the fraction of UV-selected clumpy galaxies at z~0.6 is\n20+/-12%. Roughly half of them (45+/-30%) have complex kinematics inconsistent\nwith Jeans-unstable disks, while those in the remaining half (55+/-30%) show\nlarge-scale rotations. The latter reveal a stable gaseous phase, but the\ncontribution of their stellar phase makes them globally unstable to clump\nformation. Clumpy galaxies appear to be less unstable at z~0.6 than at z~2,\nwhich could explain why the UV clumps tend to vanish in rest-frame optical\nimages of z~0.6 clumpy galaxies, conversely to z~2 clumpy galaxies, in which\nthe stellar phase can substantially fragment. This suggests that the former\ncorrespond to patchy star-formation regions superimposed on a smoother mass\ndistribution. A possible and widespread scenario for driving clump formation\nrelies on instabilities by cold streams penetrating the dark matter halos where\nclumpy galaxies inhabit. While such a gas accretion process is predicted to be\nsignificant in massive, z~2 haloes, it is also predicted to be strongly\nsuppressed in similar, z~0.6 haloes, which could explain why lowest-z clumpy\ngalaxies appear to be driven by a different mechanism. Instead, I found that\ninteractions are probably the dominant driver leading to the formation of\nclumpy galaxies at z<1. I argue that the nature of z>1 clumpy galaxies remains\nmore uncertain. While cold flows could be an important driver at z~2, I also\nargue that the observed and cumulative merger fraction between z=2 and z=3 is\nlarge enough so that every z~2 galaxy might be the result of a merger that\noccurred within their past 1 Gyr.

So\nfar, UV transit observations have led to the detection of atomic hydrogen,\noxygen and ionized carbon in the upper atmosphere of HD209458b. The\ninterpretation of these observations is controversial - it is not clear if the\nabsorption arises from an escaping atmosphere interacting with the stellar\nradiation and stellar wind, or the thermosphere inside the Roche lobe. Here we\nintroduce an empirical model that can be used to analyze UV transit depths of\nextrasolar planets and use it to interpret the transits of HD209458b in the H\nLy alpha and the OI triplet emission lines. The results indicate that the mean\ntemperature of the thermosphere is 8,000-11,000 K and that the H2/H\ndissociation front is located at pressures between 0.1-1 microbar, which\ncorrespond to an altitude of 1.1 Rp. The upper boundary of the model\nthermosphere is located at altitudes between 2.7-3 Rp, above which the\natmosphere is mostly ionized.

QUIET primarily targets\nthe B modes from primordial gravitational waves. The combination of these\nfrequencies gives sensitivity to foreground contributions from diffuse Galactic\nsynchrotron radiation. Between 2008 October and 2010 December, >10,000hours of\ndata were collected, first with the 19-element 43GHz array (3458hours) and then\nwith the 90-element 95GHz array. Each array observes the same four fields,\nselected for low foregrounds, together covering ~1000deg^2. This paper reports\ninitial results from the 43GHz receiver which has an array sensitivity to CMB\nfluctuations of 69uK sqrt(s). The data were extensively studied with a large\nsuite of null tests before the power spectra, determined with two independent\npipelines, were examined. Analysis choices, including data selection, were\nmodified until the null tests passed. Cross correlating maps with different\ntelescope pointings is used to eliminate a bias.

Additional uncertainties arise due to the choices\nmade by analysts in determining Epeak (e.g., the start and stop times of\nintegration), imperfect knowledge of the response of the detector, different\nenergy ranges for various detectors, and differences in models used to fit the\nspectra. We examine the size of these individual sources of scatter by\ncomparing many independent pairs of published Epeak values for the same bursts.\nIndeed, the observed scatter in multiple reports of the same burst (often with\nthe same data) is greatly larger than the published statistical error bars. We\nmeasure that the one-sigma uncertainty associated with the analyst's choices is\n28%, i.e., 0.12 in Log10(Epeak), with the resultant errors always being\npresent. The errors associated with the detector response are negligibly small.\nThe variations caused by commonly-used alternative definitions of Epeak (such\nas present in all papers and in all compiled burst lists) is typically 23%-46%,\nalthough this varies substantially with the application.

It is a double X-ray source and is detected in the radio at 1.4 GHz.\nThis paper investigates signatures of the interaction of the two components.\nRedshifts were measured to determine velocity dispersions and virial radii of\neach component. The technique of fuzzy clustering was used to assign membership\nweights to the galaxies in each clump. Using redshifts of 93 cluster members\nwithin 1.4 Mpc of the subcluster centres, the virial masses and anisotropy\nparameters are derived. 37% of the spectroscopically observed galaxies show\nemission lines and are predominantly star forming in the diagnostic diagram.

We also discuss some of\nthe most debilitating problems of cyclic cosmologies, Tolman's entropy problem,\nand the problem with the overproduction of blackholes.

Most clusters in our sample\nprovide significant lensing signals and are well detected in their\nreconstructed two-dimensional mass maps. Combining the current results and our\nprevious weak-lensing studies of five other high-z clusters, we compare\ngravitational lensing masses of these clusters with other observables. We\nrevisit the question whether the presence of the most massive clusters in our\nsample is in tension with the current LambdaCDM structure formation paradigm.\nWe find that the lensing masses are tightly correlated with the gas\ntemperatures and establish, for the first time, the lensing mass-temperature\nrelation at z >~ 1. For the power law slope of the M-TX relation (M propto\nT^{\\alpha}), we obtain \\alpha=1.54 +/- 0.23. This is consistent with the\ntheoretical self-similar prediction \\alpha=3/2 and with the results previously\nreported in the literature for much lower redshift samples. However, our\nnormalization is lower than the previous results by 20-30%, indicating that the\nnormalization in the M-TX relation might evolve. After correcting for Eddington\nbias and updating the discovery area with a more conservative choice, we find\nthat the existence of the most massive clusters in our sample still provides a\ntension with the current Lambda CDM model. The combined probability of finding\nthe four most massive clusters in this sample after marginalization over\ncurrent cosmological parameters is less than 1%. \n\n"}

Spectral modeling of correlated multiwavelength data gives the comoving\nmagnetic field strength, the bulk outflow Lorentz factor and the emission\nregion size. Assuming the validity of the SSC model, the Hillas condition shows\nthat only in rare cases can such sources accelerate protons to much above 10^19\neV, so > 10^20 eV ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) are likely to be heavy\nions if powered by this type of radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN).\nSurvival of nuclei is shown to be possible in TeV BL Lacs and misaligned\ncounterparts with weak photohadronic emissions. Another signature of hadronic\nproduction is intergalactic UHECR-induced cascade emission, which is an\nalternative explanation of the TeV spectra of some extreme non-variable blazars\nsuch as 1ES 0229+200 or 1ES 1101-232.

We use galaxy color and\nquantitative morphology to determine the red sequence in 25 clusters and\ndevelop a model to distinguish passively evolving early-type galaxies from\nstar-forming galaxies in both clusters and the field. With this approach, we\nidentify six SN Ia hosts that are early-type cluster members and eleven SN Ia\nhosts that are early-type field galaxies. We confirm for the first time at\nz>0.9 that SNe Ia hosted by early-type galaxies brighten and fade more quickly\nthan SNe Ia hosted by late-type galaxies. We also show that the two samples of\nhosts produce SNe Ia with similar color distributions. The relatively simple\nspectral energy distributions (SEDs) expected for passive galaxies enable us to\nmeasure stellar masses of early-type SN hosts.

Abstract: While the existence of a starburst-AGN connection is undisputed, there is no\nconsensus on what the connection is. In this contribution, we begin by noting\nthat the mechanisms which drive gas inwards in disk galaxies are generally\ninefficient at removing angular momentum, leading to stalled inflows. Thus, a\ntiered series of such processes is required to bring gas to the smallest\nscales, each of which on its own may not correlate with the presence of an AGN.\nSimilarly, each may be associated with a starburst event, making it important\nto discriminate between 'circumnuclear' and 'nuclear' star formation. In this\ncontribution, we show that stellar feedback on scales of tens of parsecs plays\na critical role in first hindering and then helping accretion.

Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are\nwell poised to detect low frequency ($10^{-9}$ -- $10^{-7}$ Hz) GWs in the near\nfuture. There has been a significant amount of research into the detection of a\nstochastic background of GWs from supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs).\nRecent work has shown that single continuous sources standing out above the\nbackground may be detectable by PTAs operating at a sensitivity sufficient to\ndetect the stochastic background. The most likely sources of continuous GWs in\nthe pulsar timing frequency band are extremely massive and/or nearby SMBHBs. In\nthis paper we present detection strategies including various forms of matched\nfiltering and power spectral summing. We determine the efficacy and\ncomputational cost of such strategies. It is shown that it is computationally\ninfeasible to use an optimal matched filter including the poorly constrained\npulsar distances with a grid based method. We show that an Earth-term-matched\nfilter constructed using only the correlated signal terms is both\ncomputationally viable and highly sensitive to GW signals. This technique is\nonly a factor of two less sensitive than the computationally unrealizable\noptimal matched filter and a factor of two more sensitive than a power spectral\nsumming technique. We further show that a pairwise matched filter, taking the\npulsar distances into account is comparable to the optimal matched filter for\nthe single template case and comparable to the Earth-term-matched filter for\nmany search templates. Finally, using simulated data optimal quality, we place\na theoretical minimum detectable strain amplitude of $h>2\\times 10^{-15}$ from\ncontinuous GWs at frequencies on the order $\\sim1/T_{\\rm obs}$. \n\n"}

As the tSZ signal is strongly non-Gaussian, higher\nmoments of tSZ maps contain useful information. We first calculate the\ndependence of the tSZ moments on cosmological parameters, finding that higher\nmoments scale more steeply with sigma_8 and are sourced by more massive galaxy\nclusters. Taking advantage of the different dependence of the variance and\nskewness on cosmological and astrophysical parameters, we construct a\nstatistic, |<T^3>|/<T^2>^1.4, which cancels much of the dependence on cosmology\n(i.e., sigma_8) yet remains sensitive to the astrophysics of intracluster gas\n(in particular, to the gas fraction in low-mass clusters).

One\ndifficulty, however, is that with the short exposure time ($\\simeq$15 seconds)\nproposed, the spatial variation of the Point Spread Function (PSF) shapes may\nbe dominated by the atmosphere, in addition to optics errors. While optics\nerrors mainly cause the PSF to vary on angular scales similar or larger than a\nsingle CCD sensor, the atmosphere generates stochastic structures on a wide\nrange of angular scales. It thus becomes a challenge to infer the multi-scale,\ncomplex atmospheric PSF patterns by interpolating the sparsely sampled stars in\nthe field. In this paper we present a new method, PSFent, for interpolating the\nPSF shape parameters, based on reconstructing underlying shape parameter maps\nwith a multi-scale maximum entropy algorithm. We demonstrate, using images from\nthe LSST Photon Simulator, the performance of our approach relative to a\n5th-order polynomial fit (representing the current standard) and a simple\nboxcar smoothing technique. Quantitatively, PSFent predicts more accurate PSF\nmodels in all scenarios and the residual PSF errors are spatially less\ncorrelated.

This finding makes it possible to determine the dark matter\nclustering from measurements of galaxy-galaxy weak lensing and galaxy\nclustering. We present new cosmological parameter constraints based on\nlarge-scale measurements of spectroscopic galaxy samples from the Sloan Digital\nSky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7 (DR7).

The 84-element W-band polarimeter\narray has a sensitivity of 87 uK sqrt(s) at a central frequency of 94.5 GHz. It\nhas the lowest systematic errors to date, contributing at r < 0.01.

Our goal is to improve the\nstudy of the combined radio-optical data by investigating if there is a\ncorrelation between the radio luminosity at 20 cm over the luminosity of the\noptical H\\alpha line (L[20 cm]/L[H\\alpha]) and line excitation ratios, where\nthe latter provide the spectroscopic classification in Seyferts, low-ionization\nnuclear emission-line regions (LINERs) and star-forming galaxies. We found that\nthe percentage of detected AGNs (Seyferts and LINERs) or composites is much\nhigher in the optical-radio sample than in the optical sample alone. There is a\nprogressive shift of the sources towards the AGN region of the diagram with\nincreasing L[20 cm]/L[H\\alpha], with an indication for a different behavior for\nLINERs and Seyferts.

Physics of the hot gas in the Coma\n  cluster Abstract: We present an analysis of Planck satellite data on the Coma Cluster observed\nvia the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect. Planck is able, for the first time, to detect\nSZ emission up to r ~ 3 X R_500. We test previously proposed models for the\npressure distribution in clusters against the azimuthally averaged data. We\nfind that the Arnaud et al. universal pressure profile does not fit Coma, and\nthat their pressure profile for merging systems provides a good fit of the data\nonly at r<R_500: by r=2XR_500 it underestimates the observed y profile by a\nfactor of ~2. This may indicate that at these larger radii either i) the\ncluster SZ emission is contaminated by unresolved SZ sources along the line of\nsight or ii) the pressure profile of Coma is higher at r>R_500 than the mean\npressure profile predicted by the simulations. The Planck image shows\nsignificant local steepening of the y profile in two regions about half a\ndegree to the west and to the south-east of the cluster centre. These features\nare consistent with the presence of shock fronts at these radii, and indeed the\nwestern feature was previously noticed in the ROSAT PSPC mosaic as well as in\nthe radio. Using Planck y profiles extracted from corresponding sectors we find\npressure jumps of 4.5+0.4-0.2 and 5.0+1.3-0.1 in the west and southeast,\nrespectively. Assuming Rankine-Hugoniot pressure jump conditions, we deduce\nthat the shock waves should propagate with Mach number M_w=2.03+0.09-0.04 and\nM_se=2.05+0.25-0.02 in the West and Southeast, respectively. Finally, we find\nthat the y and radio-synchrotron signals are quasi-linearly correlated on Mpc\nscales with small intrinsic scatter.

However, according to recent Suzaku X-ray\nmeasurements, gas mass fractions, f_gas, appear to be considerably larger than\nthe cosmic mean at the virial radius, R_200, questioning the accuracy of the\ncosmological parameter estimations. Here, we use a large suite of cosmological\nhydrodynamical simulations to study measurement biases of f_gas. We employ\ndifferent variants of simulated physics, including radiative gas physics, star\nformation, and thermal feedback by active galactic nuclei. Computing the mass\nprofiles in 48 angular cones, whose footprints partition the sphere, we find\nanisotropic gas and total mass distributions that imply an angular variance of\nf_gas at the level of 30%. This anisotropic distribution originates from the\nrecent formation epoch of clusters and from the strong internal\nbaryon-to-dark-matter density bias. In the most extreme cones, f_gas can be\nbiased high by a factor of two at R_200 in massive clusters, thereby providing\na potential explanation for high f_gas measurements by Suzaku. While projection\nlowers this factor, there are other measurement biases that may (partially)\ncompensate. We find that at R_200, f_gas is biased high by 20% when assuming\nhydrostatic equilibrium masses, i.e., neglecting the kinetic pressure, and by\nanother ~10-20% due to the presence of density clumping. At larger radii, both\nmeasurement biases increase dramatically. While the cluster sample variance of\nthe true f_gas decreases to a level of 5% at R_200, the sample variance that\nincludes both measurement biases remains fairly constant at the level of\n10-20%.

However, disc colour does increase (Delta(g - r)\n~ 0.05 mag) as a function of local density in relatively poor groups.\nTherefore, the colour--density relation for classical bulge+disc galaxies in\nthe field and in poor groups is due solely to changes in disc colour with\ndensity.

It is therefore\nimportant for the understanding of cluster properties as well as for\ncosmological applications to detect and quantify substructure in X-ray images\nof galaxy clusters.

Here we present radial\nvelocities, spectral types, vsini values, and flux ratios for the components in\nthese systems resulting from two-dimensional cross-correlation analysis.

It applies the power of infrared\nspectroscopy to the detection of cool secondaries; the flux scales as a less\nsteep function of mass in the infrared than in the visible, thus enabling an\nidentification of low-mass secondaries. We found that the RX J0513.1+0851 and\nRX J0539.9+0956 primary stars are fast rotators, 60 km/s and 80 km/s\nrespectively; this introduces extra difficulty in the detection of the\nsecondary component as a result of the quite broad absorption lines. To date,\nthese are the highest rotational velocities measured for a pre-main sequence\nspectroscopic binary. The orbital parameters and mass ratios were determined by\ncombining new visible light spectroscopy with our infrared data for both\nsystems.

This line emission makes z~5-7 galaxies appear more massive, with\nlower specific star formation rates. However, corrections for this line\nemission have been very difficult to perform reliably due to huge uncertainties\non the overall strength of such emission at z>~5.5. Here, we present the most\ndirect observational evidence yet for ubiquitous high-EW [OIII]+Hbeta line\nemission in Lyman-break galaxies at z~7, while also presenting a strategy for\nan improved measurement of the sSFR at z~7. We accomplish this through the\nselection of bright galaxies in the narrow redshift window z~6.6-7.0 where the\nIRAC 4.5 micron flux provides a clean measurement of the stellar continuum\nlight. Observed 4.5 micron fluxes in this window contrast with the 3.6 micron\nfluxes which are contaminated by the prominent [OIII]+Hbeta lines. To ensure a\nhigh S/N for our IRAC flux measurements, we consider only the brightest\n(H_{160}<26 mag) magnified galaxies we have identified in CLASH and other\nprograms targeting galaxy clusters. Remarkably, the mean rest-frame optical\ncolor for our bright seven-source sample is very blue, [3.6]-[4.5]=-0.9+/-0.3.\nSuch blue colors cannot be explained by the stellar continuum light and require\nthat the rest-frame EW of [OIII]+Hbeta be greater than 637 Angstroms for the\naverage source.

As in previous studies, the\nforming cloud begins to undergo gravitational collapse because it rapidly\nacquires a mass much larger than the average Jeans mass. Thus, the collapse\nsoon becomes nearly pressureless, proceeding along its shortest dimension\nfirst. This naturally produces filaments in the cloud, and clumps within the\nfilaments. The filaments are not in equilibrium at any time, but instead are\nlong-lived flow features, through which the gas flows from the cloud to the\nclumps. The filaments are long-lived because they accrete from their\nenvironment while simultaneously accreting onto the clumps within them; they\nare essentially the locus where the flow changes from accreting in two\ndimensions to accreting in one dimension. Moreover, the clumps also exhibit a\nhierarchical nature: the gas in a filament flows onto a main, central clump,\nbut other, smaller-scale clumps form along the infalling gas.

This model assumes that the MW halo is an\nisotropic, isothermal sphere, hypotheses that are unlikely to be valid in\nreality. An alternative approach is to derive a self-consistent solution for a\nparticular mass model of the MW (i.e. obtained from its gravitational\npotential) using the Eddington formalism, which assumes isotropy. In this paper\nwe extend this approach to incorporate an anisotropic phase-space distribution\nfunction. We perform Bayesian scans over the parameters defining the mass model\nof the MW and parameterising the phase-space density, implementing constraints\nfrom a wide range of astronomical observations. The scans allow us to estimate\nthe precision reached in the reconstruction of the velocity distribution (for\ndifferent DM halo profiles).

If such\nsupercurvature modes exist for a vector field with a sufficiently light mass,\nthen they would decay slower and easily survive the inflationary era. However,\nthe existence of supercurvature mode strongly depends on details of the system.\nTo clarify whether a massive vector field has supercurvature modes, we consider\na U(1) gauge field with gauge and conformal invariances spontaneously broken\nthrough the Higgs mechanism, and present explicit expressions for the Euclidean\nvacuum mode functions.

We\nconsider eccentric configurations at apoapsis that are instantaneously\nstationary in a rotating frame. We extend the notion of helical symmetry to\neccentric orbits, by approximating the elliptical orbit of each companion as\ninstantaneously circular, using the ellipse's inscribed circle.

Early, stream-fed, highly perturbed, gas-rich discs\nundergo phases of dissipative contraction into compact, star-forming systems\n(blue nuggets) at z~4-2. The peak of gas compaction marks the onset of central\ngas depletion and inside-out quenching into compact ellipticals (red nuggets)\nby z~2. These are sometimes surrounded by gas rings or grow extended dry\nstellar envelopes. The compaction occurs at a roughly constant specific\nstar-formation rate (SFR), and the quenching occurs at a constant stellar\nsurface density within the inner kpc ($\\Sigma_1$). Massive galaxies quench\nearlier, faster, and at a higher $\\Sigma_1$ than lower-mass galaxies, which\ncompactify and attempt to quench more than once. This evolution pattern is\nconsistent with the way galaxies populate the SFR-radius-mass space, and with\ngradients and scatter across the main sequence. The compaction is triggered by\nan intense inflow episode, involving (mostly minor) mergers, counter-rotating\nstreams or recycled gas, and is commonly associated with violent disc\ninstability. The contraction is dissipative, with the inflow rate >SFR, and the\nmaximum $\\Sigma_1$ anti-correlated with the initial spin parameter, as\npredicted by Dekel & Burkert (2014).

The discovery of pulsed radio emission from a few magnetars\nweakened the idea of a clean separation between magnetars and normal pulsars.\nWe use the partially screened gap (PSG) model to explain radio emission of\nmagnetars. The PSG model requires that the temperature of the polar cap is\nequal to the so-called critical value, i.e., the temperature at which the\nthermal ions outflowing from the stellar surface screen the acceleration gap.\nWe show that a magnetar has to fulfill the temperature, power, and visibility\nconditions in order to emit radio waves. First, in order to form PSG, the\nresidual temperature of the surface has to be lower than the critical value.\nSecond, since the radio emission is powered by the rotational energy, it has to\nbe high enough to enable heating of the polar cap by backstreaming particles to\nthe critical temperature. Finally, the structure of the magnetic field has to\nbe altered by magnetospheric currents in order to widen a radio beam and\nincrease the probability of detection.

An\nearly-time spectrum is dominated by a blue continuum, with only a marginal\nevidence for the presence of He I lines marking this SN Type. This spectrum\nshows broad absorptions bluewards than 5000A, likely O II lines, which are\nsimilar to spectral features observed in super-luminous SNe at early epochs.\nThe object has been spectroscopically monitored by PESSTO from 90 to 180 days\nafter peak, and these spectra show the typical features observed in a number of\nSN 2006jc-like events, including a blue spectral energy distribution and\nprominent and narrow (v(FWHM) ~ 1900 km/s) He I emission lines. This suggests\nthat the ejecta are interacting with He-rich circumstellar material. The\ndetection of broad (10000 km/s) O I and Ca II features likely produced in the\nSN ejecta (including the [O I] 6300A,6364A doublet in the latest spectra) lends\nsupport to the interpretation of OGLE-2012-SN-006 as a core-collapse event. \n\n"}

Its problems include (1)\nnot capturing large-scale bulk flows [leading to an O(1) error in the 1-loop\nSPT prediction for the baryon acoustic peak in the correlation function], (2)\nassuming that the Universe behaves as a pressureless, inviscid fluid, and (3)\ntreating fluctuations on scales that are non-perturbative as if they were.\nRecent studies have highlighted the successes of perturbation theory in\nLagrangian space or theories that solve equations for the effective dynamics of\nsmoothed fields. Both approaches mitigate some or all of the aforementioned\nissues with SPT. We discuss these physical developments by specializing to the\nsimplified 1D case of gravitationally interacting sheets, which allows us to\nsubstantially reduces the analytic overhead and still (as we show) maintain\nmany of the same behaviors as in 3D.

In this\nwork, we explore two much larger observational consequences of exorings: (1)\nthe significant increase in transit depth that may lead to the\nmisclassification of ringed planetary candidates as false-positives and/or the\nunderestimation of planetary density; and (2) the so-called \"photo-ring\"\neffect, a new asterodensity profiling effect, revealed by a comparison of the\nlight curve derived stellar density to that measured with independent methods\n(e.g., asteroseismology).

Many compelling models of baryogenesis rely on electroweak\nsphalerons to relax a $(B+L)$ charge asymmetry. Depending on the sign of the\nCP-violating parameter, it is shown that the erasure of positive $(B+L)$ will\nproceed more or less quickly than the relaxation of negative $(B+L)$. This is a\nhigher order effect in the kinetic equation for baryon number, which we derive\nhere through order $n_{B+L}^2$.

To assist this\nclassification, we develop a Bayesian statistical model that makes use of the\nfact that X-ray binary systems appear to cluster based on their compact object\ntype when viewed from a 3-dimensional coordinate system derived from X-ray\nspectral data. The first coordinate of this data is the ratio of counts in mid\nto low energy band (color 1), the second coordinate is the ratio of counts in\nhigh to low energy band (color 2), and the third coordinate is the sum of\ncounts in all three bands. We use this model to estimate the probabilities that\nan X-ray binary system contains a black hole, non-pulsing neutron star, or\npulsing neutron star. In particular, we utilize a latent variable model in\nwhich the latent variables follow a Gaussian process prior distribution, and\nhence we are able to induce the spatial correlation we believe exists between\nsystems of the same type.

We recover the main trends by stacking the profiles in accordance to\ntheir evolution phases. Following a wet compaction event that typically occurs\nwhen the stellar mass is $\\sim10^{9.5}~M_{\\odot}$ at $z\\sim2-4$, the gas\ndevelops a cusp inside the effective radius, associated with a peak in\nstar-formation rate (SFR). The SFR peak and the associated feedback, in the\nabsence of further gas inflow to the centre, marks the onset of gas depletion\nfrom the central 1 kpc, leading to quenching of the central SFR. An extended,\nstar-forming ring that forms by fresh gas during the central quenching process\nshows as a rising specific SFR (sSFR) profile, which is interpreted as\ninside-out quenching. Before quenching, the stellar density profile grows\nself-similarly, maintaining its log-log shape because the sSFR is similar at\nall radii. During the quenching process, the stellar density saturates to a\nconstant value, especially in the inner 1 kpc. The stellar mass and SFR\nprofiles deduced from observations show very similar shapes, consistent with\nthe scenario of wet compaction leading to inside-out quenching and the\nsubsequent saturation of a dense stellar core.

In this work we significantly expand the parameter\nspace investigated by previous simulations. In addition, the updated model\nincludes thermal sweeping, needed for studying the complete dispersal of the\ndisc. After the removal of the inner disc the disc is a non accreting\ntransition disc, an object that is rarely seen in observations.

Moreover, the requirement that\n$M_{dyn}/M_{baryon}$ should be independent of inclination yields a median value\nof $(V/\\sigma_{V,0})_{R_E}=2.1$ for galaxies without observed rotation.

Abstract: We developed a hierarchical Bayesian model (HBM) to investigate how the\npresence of Seyfert activity relates to their environment, herein represented\nby the galaxy cluster mass, $M_{200}$, and the normalized cluster-centric\ndistance, $r/r_{200}$. We achieved this by constructing an unbiased sample of\ngalaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, with morphological classifications\nprovided by the Galaxy Zoo Project. A propensity score matching approach is\nintroduced to control for the effects of confounding variables: stellar mass,\ngalaxy colour, and star formation rate. The connection between Seyfert-activity\nand environmental properties in the de-biased sample is modelled within an HBM\nframework using the so-called logistic regression technique, suitable for the\nanalysis of binary data (e.g., whether or not a galaxy hosts an AGN). Unlike\nstandard ordinary least square fitting methods, our methodology naturally\nallows modelling the probability of Seyfert-AGN activity in galaxies on their\nnatural scale, i.e. as a binary variable. Furthermore, we demonstrate how an\nHBM can incorporate information of each particular galaxy morphological type in\na unified framework. In elliptical galaxies, our analysis indicates a strong\ncorrelation of Seyfert-AGN activity with $r/r_{200}$, and a weaker correlation\nwith the mass of the host. In spiral galaxies these trends do not appear,\nsuggesting that the link between Seyfert activity and the properties of spiral\ngalaxies are independent of the environment. \n\n"}

Classifying them reliably is however a challenging task due to\ndegeneracies in WISE multicolour space and low levels of detection in its two\nlongest-wavelength bandpasses. Here we aim at obtaining comprehensive and\nreliable star, galaxy and quasar catalogues based on automatic source\nclassification in full-sky WISE data. This means that the final classification\nwill employ only parameters available from WISE itself, in particular those\nreliably measured for a majority of sources. For the automatic classification\nwe applied the support vector machines (SVM) algorithm, which requires a\ntraining sample with relevant classes already identified, and we chose to use\nthe SDSS spectroscopic dataset for that purpose. By calibrating the classifier\non the test data drawn from SDSS, we first established that a polynomial kernel\nis preferred over a radial one for this particular dataset. Next, using three\nclassification parameters (W1 magnitude, W1-W2 colour, and a differential\naperture magnitude) we obtained very good classification efficiency in all the\ntests.

There is increasing evidence that these observed discrepancies\nmay be due to contamination by star formation and other selection effects.\nUsing a sample of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7, we\ntest if an intrinsic Eddington ratio distribution that takes the form of a\nSchechter function is consistent with previous work that suggests that young\ngalaxies in optical surveys have an observed lognormal Eddington ratio\ndistribution. We simulate the optical emission line properties of a population\nof galaxies and AGN using a broad instantaneous luminosity distribution\ndescribed by a Schechter function near the Eddington limit. This simulated AGN\npopulation is then compared to observed galaxies via the positions on an\nemission line excitation diagram and Eddington ratio distributions. We present\nan improved method for extracting the AGN distribution using BPT diagnostics\nthat allows us to probe over one order of magnitude lower in Eddington ratio\ncounteracting the effects of dilution by star formation.

We propose a\nsupervised machine learning approach to this endeavour, based on principal\ncomponent analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, followed by artificial\nneural networks (ANNs) estimating the spectral type. Our analysis is performed\nwith image simulations mimicking the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced\nCamera for Surveys (ACS) in the F606W and F814W bands, as well as the Euclid\nVIS imager. We first demonstrate this classification in a simple context,\nassuming perfect knowledge of the point spread function (PSF) model and the\npossibility of accurately generating mock training data for the machine\nlearning. We then analyse its performance in a fully data-driven situation, in\nwhich the training would be performed with a limited subset of bright stars\nfrom a survey, and an unknown PSF with spatial variations across the detector.\nWe use simulations of main-sequence stars with flat distributions in spectral\ntype and in signal-to-noise ratio, and classify these stars into 13 spectral\nsubclasses, from O5 to M5. Under these conditions, the algorithm achieves a\nhigh success rate both for Euclid and HST images, with typical errors of half a\nspectral class.

The simulations follow three\nexponential disks of different mass but similar circular velocity, radial\nscalelength, and (constant) scale height. The disks develop different\nnon-axisymmetric patterns, ranging from feeble, long-lived multiple arms to\nstrong, rapidly-evolving few-armed spirals. These fluctuations induce radial\nmigration through secular changes in the angular momentum of disk particles,\nmixing the disk radially and blurring pre-existing gradients. Migration affects\nprimarily stars with small vertical excursions, regardless of spiral pattern.\nThis \"provenance bias\" largely determines the vertical structure of migrating\nstars: inward migrators thin down as they move in, whereas outward migrators do\nnot thicken up but rather preserve the disk scale height at destination.\nMigrators of equal birth radius thus develop a strong scale-height gradient,\nnot by flaring out as commonly assumed, but by thinning down as they spread\ninward. Similar gradients have been observed for low-[$\\alpha$/Fe]\nmono-abundance populations (MAPs) in the Galaxy but our results argue against\ninterpreting them as a consequence of radial migration. This is because outward\nmigration does not lead to thickening, implying that the maximum scale height\nof any population should reflect its value at birth. In contrast, Galactic MAPs\nhave scale heights that increase monotonically outwards, reaching values that\ngreatly exceed those at their presumed birth radii. Given the strong vertical\nbias affecting migration, a proper assessment of the importance of radial\nmigration in the Galaxy should take carefully into account the strong radial\ndependence of the scale heights of the various stellar populations. \n\n"}

Despite this key difference, a number of\nindications have consolidated the idea that XRFs and GRBs share a common\norigin, including a number of potential XRF/supernova associations and the\nconsistency of some XRFs with the Amati relation for long GRBs. However, the\ndifficulties in explaining XRFs as off-axis or intrinsically weak GRBs still\ncast doubts on this interpretation.

Abstract: Occultation light curves of exomoons may give information on their albedo and\nhence indicate the presence of ice cover on the surface.

The objective of our\npaper is to determine whether next generation telescopes will be capable of\nalbedo estimations for icy exomoons using their occultation light curves. The\nsuccess of the measurements depends on the depth of the moon's occultation in\nthe light curve and on the sensitivity of the used instruments. We applied\nsimple calculations for different stellar masses in the V and J photometric\nbands, and compared the flux drop caused by the moon's occultation and the\nestimated photon noise of next generation missions with 5 $\\sigma$ confidence.\nWe found that albedo estimation by this method is not feasible for moons of\nsolar-like stars, but small M dwarfs are better candidates for such\nmeasurements. Our calculations in the J photometric band show that E-ELT\nMICADO's photon noise is just about 4 ppm greater than the flux difference\ncaused by a 2 Earth-radii icy satellite in a circular orbit at the snowline of\nan 0.1 stellar mass star. However, considering only photon noise underestimates\nthe real expected noise, because other noise sources, such as CCD read-out and\ndark signal become significant in the near infrared measurements. Hence we\nconclude that occultation measurements with next generation missions are far\ntoo challenging, even in the case of large, icy moons at the snowline of small\nM dwarfs.

Therefore, the correct information of two-point clustering and\nany order of moments in weak lensing field should be preserved under\nlocal-Gaussianized transformation.

We provide a description of the\nconstruction of the NORAS II galaxy cluster survey based on X-ray data from the\nnorthern part of the ROSAT All-Sky Survey. NORAS II extends the NORAS survey\ndown to a flux limit of 1.8 x 10^(-12) erg s^-1 cm^-2 (0.1 - 2.4 keV)\nincreasing the sample size by about a factor of two. The NORAS II cluster\nsurvey now reaches the same quality and depth of its counterpart, the Southern\nREFLEX II survey, allowing us to combine the two complementary surveys. The\npaper provides information on the determination of the cluster X-ray\nparameters, the identification process of the X-ray sources, the statistics of\nthe survey, and the construction of the survey selection function, which we\nprovide in numerical format. Currently NORAS II contains 860 clusters with a\nmedian redshift of z = 0.102.

The competitive\naccretion theory of massive star formation posits that the most massive stars\nshould sit in deeper potential wells than lower-mass stars. This may be\nobservable in the relative surface density or spatial concentration of the most\nmassive stars compared to other, lower-mass stars. Massive stars in\ncool--collapse N-body models do end up in significantly deeper potentials, and\nare mass segregated. However, in models of warm (expanding) star-forming\nregions, whilst the massive stars do come to be in deeper potentials than\naverage stars, they are not mass segregated. In the purely hydrodynamical SPH\nsimulations, the massive stars do come to reside in deeper potentials, which is\ndue to their runaway growth. However, when photoionisation and stellar winds\nare implemented in the simulations, these feedback mechanisms regulate the mass\nof the stars and disrupt the inflow of gas into the clouds' potential wells.\nThis generally makes the potential wells shallower than in the control runs,\nand prevents the massive stars from occupying deeper potentials. This in turn\nresults in the most massive stars having a very similar spatial concentration\nand surface density distribution to lower-mass stars. Whilst massive stars do\nform via competitive accretion in our simulations, this rarely translates to a\ndifferent spatial distribution and so any lack of primordial mass segregation\nin an observed star-forming region does not preclude competitive accretion as a\nviable formation mechanism for massive stars. \n\n"}

By calculating the\nmicroscopic viscosity on the basis of various theoretical assumptions and\nestimating the Kolmogorov length from the turbulent dissipation rate computed\nwith a subgrid-scale model, we are able to demonstrate that most of the\nwarm-hot intergalactic medium can sustain a fully turbulent state only if the\nmagnetic suppression of the viscosity is considerable. Accepting this as\npremise, it turns out that ratios of turbulent and thermal quantities change\nonly little in the course of the merger. This confirms the tight correlations\nbetween the mean thermal and non-thermal energy content for large samples of\nclusters in earlier studies, which can be interpreted as second self-similarity\non top of the self-similarity for different halo masses. Another long-standing\nquestion is how and to which extent turbulence contributes to the support of\nthe gas against gravity. From a global perspective, the ratio of turbulent and\nthermal pressures is significant for the clusters in our simulation. On the\nother hand, a local measure is provided by the compression rate, i.e. the\ngrowth rate of the divergence of the flow.

We assume that the Standard Model is valid up to certain, high,\nenergy scale $\\Lambda$ and use the framework of the effective field theory to\ndescribe physics below that scale. Performing numerical simulations with\ndifferent values of the scale $\\Lambda$ we are able to extend our previous\nanalysis and determine its range of validity.\n  We study domain walls interpolating between the physical electroweak vacuum\nand the vacuum appearing at very high field strengths. These domain walls could\nbe formed from non-homogeneous configurations of the Higgs field produced by\nquantum fluctuations during inflation or thermal fluctuations during reheating.\n  Our numerical simulations show that evolution of Higgs domain walls is rather\ninsensitive to interactions beyond the Standard Model as long as masses of new\nparticles are grater than $10^{12}\\ \\textrm{GeV}$. For lower values of\n$\\Lambda$ the RG improved effective potential is strongly modified at field\nstrengths crucial to the evolution of domain walls.

We find that\neven in the case when the minima of the potential are nearly degenerate Higgs\ndomain walls decayed shortly after their formation for generic initial\nconditions. On the other hand, in simulations with specifically chosen initial\nconditions Higgs domain walls can live longer and enter the scaling regime.\n  We also determine the energy spectrum of gravitational waves produced by\ndecaying domain walls of the Higgs field. For generic initial field\nconfigurations the amplitude of the signal is too small to be observed in\npresent and planned detectors. \n\n"}

Sets of transit depths so far measured at different wavelengths\n(called transmission spectra) are somewhat diverse: Some show steep spectral\nslope features in the visible, some contain featureless spectra in the\nnear-infrared, some show distinct features from radiative absorption by gaseous\nspecies.

The\nrepercussions of a supernova can be rather profound, and the current Solar\nSystem may still bear the memory of this traumatic event. The truncation of the\nKuiper belt and the tilt of the ecliptic plane with respect to the Sun's\nrotation axis could be such signatures. We simulated the effect of a nearby\nsupernova on the young Solar System using the Astronomical Multipurpose\nSoftware Environment. Our calculations are realized in two subsequent steps in\nwhich we study the effect of the supernova irradiation on the circumstellar\ndisk and the effect of the impact of the nuclear blast-wave which arrives a few\ndecades later. We find that the blastwave of our adopted supernova exploding at\na distance of $0.15$--$0.40$\\,pc and at an angle of $35^\\circ$--$65^\\circ$ with\nrespect to the angular-momentum axis of the circumsolar disk would induce a\nmisalignment between the Sun's equator and its disk to $5^\\circ.6\\pm1^\\circ.2$,\nconsistent with the current value. The blast of a supernova truncates the disk\nat a radius between $42$ and $55$\\,au, which is consistent with the current\nedge of the Kuiper belt. For the most favored parameters, the irradiation by\nthe supernova as well as the blast wave heat the majority of the disk to $\\sim\n1200$\\,K, which is sufficiently hot to melt chondrules in the circumstellar\ndisk. The majority of planetary system may have been affected by a nearby\nsupernova, some of its repercussions, such as truncation and tilting of the\ndisk, may still be visible in their current planetary system's topology.

Here we find that\nthe first six binary black hole (BBH) merging events reported by LIGO/Virgo\nshow clear evidence for lensing in the plane of observed mass and source\ndistance. The four lowest frequency events follow an apparent locus in this\nplane, which we can reproduce by galaxy lensing, where the higher the\nmagnification, the generally more distant the source so the wave train is\nstretched more by the Universal expansion, by factors of 2-4. This revises the\nreported BBH distances upwards by an order of magnitude, equal to the square\nroot of the magnification. Furthermore, the reported black hole masses must be\ndecreased by 2-4 to counter the larger stretch factor, since the orbital\nfrequency is used to derive the black hole masses. This lowers the masses to\n5-15 solar masses, well below the puzzlingly high values of 20-35 solar masses\notherwise estimated, with the attraction of finding agreement in mass with\nblack holes orbiting stars in our own Galaxy, thereby implying a stellar origin\nfor the low frequency events in the far Universe.

Beyond a Galactic radius of 300\nkpc, dwarfs tend to retain their gas. At roughly 50 kpc, the MCs have\nexperienced substantial gas stripping as evidenced by the Magellanic Stream\nwhich extends from them. Since Sgr experienced star formation long after it\nfell into the Galaxy, it is interesting to explore just how and when this dwarf\nlost its gas. To date, there has been no definitive detection of an associated\ngas component. We revisit recent simulations of the stellar and dark matter\ncomponents of Sgr but, for the first time, include gas that is initially bound\nto the infalling galaxy. We find that the gas stripping was 30 - 50 % complete\nat its first disc crossing ~2.7 Gyr ago, then entirely stripped at its last\ndisc crossing ~1 Gyr ago. Our timeline is consistent with the last substantial\nburst of star formation in Sgr which occurred about the time of the last disc\ncrossing. We discuss the consequences of gas stripping and conclude that the\nvast majority of the stripped gas was fully settled onto the Galaxy by ~300 Myr\nago.

For both cases, we measure the accretion rate onto the cores\nas a function of core mass and Stokes number ($\\tau_s$) of the particles and\ncompare it to recent MRI turbulence simulations.

In the hadronic scenario the TeV gamma-ray emission from\nSNRs originates from decaying pions that are produced in collisions of the\ninterstellar gas and CRs. Using CR-magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we show\nthat magnetic obliquity-dependent shock acceleration is able to reproduce the\nobserved TeV gamma-ray morphology of SNRs such as Vela Jr. and SN1006 solely by\nvarying the magnetic morphology. This implies that gamma-ray bright regions\nresult from quasi-parallel shocks (i.e., when the shock propagates at a narrow\nangle to the upstream magnetic field), which are known to efficiently\naccelerate CR protons, and that gamma-ray dark regions point to\nquasi-perpendicular shock configurations. Comparison of the simulated gamma-ray\nmorphology to observations allows us to constrain the magnetic coherence scale\n$\\lambda_B$ around Vela Jr. and SN1006 to $\\lambda_B \\simeq 13_{-4.3}^{+13}$ pc\nand $\\lambda_B >200_{-10}^{+80}$ pc, respectively, where the ambient magnetic\nfield of SN1006 is consistent with being largely homogeneous.

Such a selection technique offers a very\npure sample completeness, since all cosmological point sources are selected\nregardless of their intrinsic spectral properties within the limiting magnitude\nof Gaia. We carry out a pilot-study by defining a sample compiled by including\nall Gaia-DR2 sources within one degree of the North Galactic Pole (NGP)\nselected to have proper motions consistent with zero within 2-sigma\nuncertainty. By cross-matching the sample to the optical Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey (SDSS) and the mid-infrared AllWISE photometric catalogues we\ninvestigate the colours of each of our sources.

This power\nspectrum has been suggested as a key observable that can be extracted from\nstrongly lensed images and yield important clues about the matter distribution\nwithin the lens galaxy. We use two different $N$-body simulations from the\nETHOS framework: one with cold dark matter and another with self-interacting\ndark matter and a cutoff in the initial power spectrum. Despite earlier works\nthat identified $ k \\gtrsim 100$ kpc$^{-1}$ as the most promising scales to\nlearn about the particle nature of dark matter we find that even at lower\nwavenumbers - which are actually within reach of observations in the near\nfuture - we can gain important information about dark matter.

In this work we revisit the dynamics of planets in S-type binary\nsystems. For that purpose we develop explicit formulas for the secularized\noctupolar Hamiltonian, coupled with general relativistic corrections and\nnon-conservative interactions. We implemented those formulas in an open-source\npackage \\texttt{SecDev3B}, that can be used to reproduce our results or test\nimproved versions of the models. In order to test it, we study the long-term\ndynamical evolution of S-type binary planets during the pre-main-sequence phase\nof stellar evolution. During that phase, stellar radius significantly changes\nin timescales similar to secular timescales. We hypothesize that when\nclose-encounters between the planet and its host star happens (e.g. via\nLidov-Kozai effect), particularities in the secular formalism plus changes in\nstellar radius may alter significantly the dynamical evolution.

In this paper we explore the mechanical coupling between\nthe core r-modes and the elastic crust, using a toy model of a constant density\nneutron star with a constant shear modulus crust. We find that, at spin\nfrequencies in excess of ~50 Hz, the r-modes strongly penetrate the crust. This\nreduces the relative motion (slippage) between the crust and the core compared\nto the rigid crust limit. We therefore revise down, by as much as a factor of\n10^2-10^3, the damping rate computed by BU, significantly reducing the maximal\npossible spin frequency of neutron star with a solid crust. The dependence of\nthe crust-core slippage on the spin frequency is complicated, and is very\nsensitive to the physical thickness of the crust. If the crust is sufficiently\nthick, the curve of the critical spin frequency for the onset of the r-mode\ninstability becomes multi-valued for some temperatures; this is related to the\navoided crossings between the r-mode and the higher-order torsional modes in\nthe crust.

If the crust is assumed to be perfectly rigid, the\ngravitational radiation driven instability in the r-modes is completely\nsuppressed in neutron stars colder than about 1.5 x 10^8 K. Energy generation\nin the boundary layer will heat the star, and will even melt the crust if the\namplitude of the r-mode is large enough.

This FR I radio galaxy\nis located very near the center of the RC 0 cluster Abell 428. The existence of\nsuch an object violates a fundamental paradigm for radio loud AGN. In paper I,\nwe showed that this object was most likely a spiral host with optical line\nratios and colors consistent with an AGN. In this paper, we present new, higher\nresolution radio imaging, a radio/mm continuum spectrum for the nucleus, a\ndetection of HI absorption against the bright radio core, an upper-limit to CO\nand the gas mass, and 70 optical redshifts. We confirm the existence of a radio\njet at 20cm extending 42 kpc into the southern lobe. At 3.6cm, we also detect a\nnuclear jet similar in length to that in M87 but 10 times weaker. We believe\nthat this is the first detection of a radio jet on these scales in a disk or\nspiral host galaxy. The nuclear radio spectrum is similar to many blazar or QSO\nlike objects, suggesting that the galaxy harbors an imbedded and obscured AGN.\nWe model a turnover in the spectrum at low frequencies as Free-Free absorption.\nWe detect very strong and narrow HI absorption with nearly the entire 20 cm\ncore continuum absorbed, implying an unusually large optical depth (tau~1). We\nsuggest that the nucleus is seen through a disk-like distribution of ISM gas,\npossibly through a spiral arm or a warp to account for the high column density.\n  From the radial velocities, we find that A428 is in fact made up of at least\n2 clumps of galaxies separated by 3300 km/s, which are imbedded in a nearly\ncontinuous distribution of galaxies over 13000 km/s in velocity.

In\nthese systems a `normal' outburst immediately precedes a 5-10 times longer\n(`super')outburst. The optical light curve of the outbursts of XTE J1118+480 is\nremarkably similar to that seen in some SU UMa stars, such as UV Per and T Leo,\nwhere the precursor outburst is distinct from the superoutburst, but the time\nscales are a factor of ~15 different. The first outburst of XTE J1118+480 was\nrelatively short (~1 month) while the second outburst was ~5 times longer.\nDuring the second outburst superhumps were seen, a feature characteristic for\nsuperoutbursts. The gap of about a month between the two outbursts is longer in\nX-rays with respect to the optical, a feature not previously recognized for\nX-ray transients. Also in SU UMa stars the precursor outburst becomes more\ndistinct at shorter wavelengths. Finally, I show that the time of appearance of\nthe superhumps in XTE J1118+480 is consistent with the expected superhump\ngrowth time, if the superhump mechanism was triggered during the first\noutburst. I conclude that the similarity in outburst behaviour in the two types\nof systems provides further support that a common mechanism is at work to start\nthe long (`super')outbursts. \n\n"}

First, we show that the dark bursts cannot be explained by a failure to\nimage deeply enough quickly enough: We fit a variety of brightness distribution\nmodels to the optical data, and find that approx. 57(+13,-11)% of all bursts,\nand approx. 82(+22,-17)% of dark bursts, have afterglows that are fainter than\nR = 24 mag 18 hours after the burst. Secondly, we show that dark bursts tend to\nbe X-ray and radio faint.

First, we find that a hydromagnetic (MHD)\ncoupling between the crust and the core strongly modifies the star's\nprecessional modes when $t_a\\le\\sim (T_s\\times T_p)^{1/2}$; here $t_a$ is the\nAlfven crossing timescale, and $T_s$ and $T_p$ are the star's spin and\nprecession periods, respectively. We argue that in a precessing pulsar PSR\nB1828-11 the restoring MHD stress prevents a free wobble of the crust relative\nto the non-precessing core. Instead, the crust and the proton-electron plasma\nin the core must precess in unison, and their combined ellipticity determines\nthe period of precession. Link has recently shown that the neutron superfluid\nvortices in the core of PSR B1828-11 cannot be pinned to the plasma; he has\nalso argued that this lack of pinning is expected if the proton Fermi liquid in\nthe core is type-I superconductor. In this case, the neutron superfluid is\ndynamically decoupled from the precessing motion. The pulsar's precession\ndecays due to the mutual friction between the neutron superfluid and the plasma\nin the core. The decay is expected to occur over tens to hundreds of precession\nperiods and may be measurable over a human lifetime. Such a measurement would\nprovide information about the strong n-p interaction in the neutron-star core.\nSecond, we consider the effect of gravitomagnetic coupling between the neutron\nsuperfluid in the core and the rest of the star and show that this coupling\nchanges the rate of precession by about 10%.

Abstract: We report on a short XMM-Newton observation of the radio-quiet Narrow Line\nSeyfert 1 PG 1402+261. The EPIC X-ray spectrum of PG 1402+261 shows a strong\nexcess of counts between 6-9 keV in the rest frame. This feature can be modeled\nby an unusually strong (equivalent width 2 keV) and very broad (FWHM velocity\nof 110000 km/s) iron K-shell emission line. The line centroid energy at 7.3 keV\nappears blue-shifted with respect to the iron Kalpha emission band between\n6.4-6.97 keV, while the blue-wing of the line extends to 9 keV in the quasar\nrest frame. The line profile can be fitted by reflection from the inner\naccretion disk, but an inclination angle of >60 deg is required to model the\nextreme blue-wing of the line. Furthermore the extreme strength of the line\nrequires a geometry whereby the hard X-ray emission from PG 1402+261 above 2\nkeV is dominated by the pure-reflection component from the disk, while little\nor none of the direct hard power-law is observed. Alternatively the spectrum\nabove 2 keV may instead be explained by an ionized absorber, if the column\ndensity is sufficiently high (N_H > 3 x 10^23 cm^-2) and if the matter is\nionized enough to produce a deep (tau~1) iron K-shell absorption edge at 9 keV.\nThis absorber could originate in a large column density, high velocity outflow,\nperhaps similar to those which appear to be observed in several other high\naccretion rate AGN. Further observations, especially at higher spectral\nresolution, are required to distinguish between the accretion disk reflection\nor outflow scenarios. \n\n"}

Comparison of the\nX-ray image with that of the previously known radio halo reveals a coincidence\nof the leading edge of the halo with the bow shock, offering an interesting\nexperimental setup for determining the role of shocks in the radio halo\ngeneration. The halo in A520 apparently consists of two spatially distinct\nparts, the main turbulence-driven component and a cap-like forward structure\nrelated to the shock, where the latter may provide pre-energized electrons for\nsubsequent turbulent re-acceleration. The radio edge may be caused by electron\nacceleration by the shock. If so, the synchrotron spectrum should have a slope\nof 1.2 right behind the edge with quick steepening further away from the edge.\nAlternatively, if shocks are inefficient accelerators, the radio edge may be\nexplained by an increase in the magnetic field and density of pre-existing\nrelativistic electrons due to gas compression.

In\ngalaxy clusters, the abundance of dwarf galaxies is in good agreement with the\nexpectation based on the subhalo mass function, whereas in galaxy groups, the\nrelatively small abundance of dwarfs conflicts with theoretical expectations.\nIn all halo systems, there is a dip in the abundance of galaxies with\nluminosities in the range ~ 2x10^8 L_sun to 10^10 L_sun, corresponding to\nsubhalo mass scales between ~ 5x10^10 M_sun to few times 10^11 M_sun.\nPhotoionization from reionization has been used to explain statistics of the\ndwarf population, with larger systems forming prior to, and smaller systems\nforming subsequent to, reionization. The observed dip in the LF is an imprint\nof small dwarf galaxies (<2x10^8 L_sun) that formed prior to reionization.

In order to address such questions, we build\na model to describe the distribution of galaxy underdensities.

The initial configurations are assumed to be remnants of binary\nneutron star (NS) or NS+BH mergers and consist of a 4 solar mass BH with varied\nspin, girded by a torus with a mass between 0.01 and 0.2 solar masses. The\nevolution of tori without and with physical shear viscosity is simulated, using\na realistic equation of state and following the energy loss and lepton number\nchange due to neutrino emission by a neutrino-trapping scheme. The\ntime-dependent efficiency of converting rest-mass energy to neutrinos is found\nto reach 10 percent, the efficiency of converting neutrino energy into a\npair-photon fireball by neutrino annihilation can reach several percent.

The shape of this cut-off differs from pure thermal\nComptonisation, suggesting the presence of a non-thermal component at higher\nenergies.The average broad band spectrum is well represented by hybrid\nthermal/non-thermal Comptonisation models. During the 4 day long observation\nthe source showed an important spectral and flux variability. A principal\ncomponent analysis demonstrates that most of this variability occurs through 2\nindependent modes. The first mode consists in changes in the overall luminosity\non time scale of hours with almost constant spectra that are strikingly\nuncorrelated with the variable radio flux. We interpret this variability mode\nas variations of the dissipation rate in the corona. The second variability\nmode consists in a pivoting of the spectrum around 10 keV. It acts on a longer\ntime-scale: initially soft, the spectrum hardens in the first part of the\nobservation and then softens again. This pivoting pattern is strongly\ncorrelated with the radio (15 GHz) emission: radio fluxes are stronger when the\nINTEGRAL spectrum is harder. We propose that the pivoting mode represents a\n'mini' state transition from a nearly High Soft State to a nearly Low Hard\nState, and back. This mini-transition would be caused by changes in the soft\ncooling photons flux in the hot Comptonising plasma associated with an increase\nof the temperature of the accretion disc.

If this hypothetic\nforeground is subtracted from the CMB data, the amplitude of the quadrupole\n(l=2) is substantially increased, and the statistically improbable alignment of\nthe quadrupole with the octopole (l=3) is substantially weakened, increasing\ndramatically the likelihood of the \"cleaned\" maps.

Although the 1-year WMAP\ndata clearly points the location of this hypothetical foreground to the LSC or\nits specular image (i.e., the vicinity of the poles of the cosmic dipole axis),\nthe three-year data seems to point to these locations as well as the north\necliptic pole.

Here we examine the effect of a\nsharp increase in the external density on the light curve by considering, for\nthe first time, a full treatment of both the hydrodynamic evolution and the\nradiation in this scenario. To this end we develop a semi-analytic model for\nthe light curve and carry out several elaborate numerical simulations using a\n1D hydrodynamic code together with a synchrotron radiation code.Two spherically\nsymmetric cases are explored in detail: a density jump in a uniform external\nmedium, and a wind termination shock. Contrary to previous works, we find that\neven a sharp (step function) and large (by a factor of $a>>1$) increase in the\nexternal density does not produce sharp features in the light curve, and cannot\naccount for significant temporal variability. For a wind termination shock, the\nlight curve smoothly transitions between the asymptotic power-laws over about\none decade in time, and there is no rebrightening in the optical or X-rays to\nserve as a clear observational signature. For a sharp jump in a uniform density\nwe find that the maximal deviation $\\Delta\\alpha_max$ of the temporal decay\nindex $\\alpha$ from its asymptotic value, is bounded (e.g., $\\Delta\\alpha_max\n<0.4$ for $a=10$); $\\Delta\\alpha_max$ slowly increases with $a$, converging to\n$\\Delta\\alpha_{max} \\approx 1$ at very large $a$ values. Therefore, no optical\nrebrightening is expected here as well. In the X-rays, while the asymptotic\nflux is unaffected by the density jump, the fluctuations in $\\alpha$ are found\nto be comparable to those in the optical. Finally, we discuss the implications\nof our results for the origin of the fluctuations in several afterglows. \n\n"}

All of these elements are overabundant in the bulge\nrelative to the disk, especially Mg, indicating that the bulge is enhanced in\nType~II supernova ejecta and most likely formed more rapidly than the disk.

At a very early stage (few seconds), the\nobserved bolometric luminosity increases as t^2. On longer time scales (more\nthan about 10s), the luminosity drops as t^{-1}. If the main burst is long\nenough, an intermediate stage of constant luminosity will form. In this case,\nthe after-glow overlaps the main burst, otherwise there is a time separation\nbetween the two. On the long time scale, the flow decelerate in a self similar\nway, reaching non relativistic velocities after about 30days. Due to the\ndeceleration and the accumulation of ISM material, the relation between the\nobserved time, the shock radius, and its Lorentz factor, is given by\nt=R/16\\gamma^2c which is a factor of 8 different from the usual expression.

We point out that Bose-Einstein condensation implies\nthe existence of long-range order and of a gap-less mode of the (singlet)\nHiggs-field. This gives rise to a $1/r$ potential and couples with\ninfinitesimal strength to the inertial mass of known particles. If this is\ninterpreted as the origin of Newtonian gravity one finds a natural solution of\nthe hierarchy problem. As in any theory incorporating the Equivalence\nPrinciple, the classical tests in weak gravitational fields are fulfilled as in\ngeneral relativity. On the other hand, our picture suggests that Einstein\ngeneral relativity may represent the weak field approximation of a theory\ngenerated from flat space with a sequence of conformal transformations. This\nexplains naturally the absence of a {\\it large} cosmological constant from\nsymmetry breaking. Finally, one also predicts new phenomena that have no\ncounterpart in Einstein theory such as typical `fifth force' deviations below\nthe centimeter scale or further modifications at distances $10^{17}$ cm in\nconnection with the Pioneer anomaly and the mass discrepancy in galactic\nsystems. \n\n"}
