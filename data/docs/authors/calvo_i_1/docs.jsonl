This agreement requires that the\ngalactic halo be of sufficient extent to maintain the galaxy at high curvature\nin the presence of the low-curvature cosmological background. If the galactic\nhalo and local environment in f(R) models do not have substantially deeper\npotentials than expected in LCDM, then cosmological field amplitudes |f_R| >\n10^{-6} will cause the galactic interior to evolve to low curvature during the\nacceleration epoch.

Even small\ndeviations that conservatively satisfy both galactic and solar-system\nconstraints can still be tested by future, percent-level measurements of the\nlinear power spectrum, while they remain undetectable to cosmological-distance\nmeasures.

Remarkably, in the case\nof N=2 quiver CS theories, the resulting D3-brane action covers a larger region\nin the parameter space of the complex structure moduli than the N=4 quiver CS\ntheories. We also investigate how the SL(2,Z) duality transformation is\nrealized in the resultant D3-brane theory. \n\n"}

For two body collisions excitations of transverse\nmodes are the prerequisite for energy exchange and thermalzation. At very low\ntemperatures excitations of transverse modes are exponentially suppressed,\nthermalization by two body collisions stops and the system should become\nintegrable. In quantum mechanics virtual excitations of higher radial modes are\npossible. These virtually excited radial modes give rise to effective\nthree-body velocity-changing collisions which lead to thermalization. We show\nthat these three-body elastic interactions are suppressed by pairwise quantum\ncorrelations when approaching the strongly correlated regime. If the relative\nmomentum $k$ is small compared to the two-body coupling constant $c$ the\nthree-particle scattering state is suppressed by a factor of $(k/c)^{12}$,\nwhich is proportional to $\\gamma ^{12}$, that is to the square of the\nthree-body correlation function at zero distance in the limit of the\nLieb-Liniger parameter $\\gamma \\gg 1$.

In this article we define and\nsystematically investigate what might be called \"$F$-zips with a\n$G$-structure\", for an arbitrary reductive linear algebraic group $G$.\n  These objects come in two incarnations. One incarnation is an exact linear\ntensor functor from the category of finite dimensional representations of $G$\nto the category of $F$-zips over $S$. Locally any such functor has a type\n$\\chi$, which is a cocharacter of $G$. The other incarnation is a certain\n$G$-torsor analogue of the notion of $F$-zips. We prove that both incarnations\ndefine stacks that are naturally equivalent to a quotient stack of the form\n$[E_{G,\\chi}\\backslash G_k]$ that was studied in an earlier paper.

The model is described by three Heisenberg chains,\nwith exchange constant J, coupled antiferromagnetically with exchange constant\nJ' along the diagonals of the ladder system, with periodic boundary conditions\nin the shorter direction. We determine the full phase diagram of this model as\na function of spatial anisotropy, J'/J, and magnetic field.

Among the dominant\nphases generated by quantum effects are commensurate and incommensurate\ncoplanar quasi-ordered states, which appear in the vicinity of the isotropic\nregion for most fields, and in the high field region for most anisotropies. The\ncoplanar states, while not classical ground states, can be understood\nsemiclassically.

Applying an effective action approach, the most\ngeneral form of the free energy quadratic in the extrinsic curvature and\nextrinsic twist potential of stationary fluid brane configurations is\nconstructed to second order in a derivative expansion. This construction\ngeneralizes the Helfrich-Canham bending energy for fluid membranes studied in\ntheoretical biology to the case in which the fluid is rotating. It is found\nthat stationary fluid brane configurations are characterized by a set of 3\nelastic response coefficients, 3 hydrodynamic response coefficients and 1 spin\nresponse coefficient for co-dimension greater than one. Moreover, the elastic\ndegrees of freedom present in the system are coupled to the hydrodynamic\ndegrees of freedom. For co-dimension-1 surfaces we find a 8 independent\nparameter family of stationary fluid branes.

However, we derive\nscaling relations describing the singular behavior of fidelity susceptibility\nin the quantum critical surfaces. Moreover, we study the time evolution of the\nsystem after a critical quantum quench using the Loschmidt. We find that the\nrevival times of Loschmidt echo are given by $T_{rev}=N/2v_{max}$, where $N$ is\nthe size of the system and $v_{max}$ is the maximum of lower bound group\nvelocity of quasi-particles. Although the fidelity susceptibility shows the\nsame exponent in all critical surfaces, the structure of the revivals after\ncritical quantum quenches displays two different regimes reflecting different\nequilibration dynamics. \n\n"}

As a result, we are led\nto the conclusion that the probability for a given region to ignite inflation\nat sub-Planckian densities is extremely small.

Modifications to\nRaychaudhuri equation are implemented independently as quadratic and cubic\nterms of energy density without introducing additional degrees of freedom.\nDepending on their sign, modifications make gravity repulsive above a curvature\nscale for matter satisfying strong energy condition, or more attractive than in\nthe classical theory.

They have been used to construct\nexplicit toy models realizing many interesting structural features of the\nAdS/CFT correspondence, including the non-uniqueness of bulk operator\nreconstruction in the boundary theory. In this article, we explore the\nholographic properties of networks of random tensors. We find that our models\nnaturally incorporate many features that are analogous to those of the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence. When the bond dimension of the tensors is large, we show that\nthe entanglement entropy of boundary regions, whether connected or not, obey\nthe Ryu-Takayanagi entropy formula, a fact closely related to known properties\nof the multipartite entanglement of assistance. Moreover, we find that each\nboundary region faithfully encodes the physics of the entire bulk entanglement\nwedge. Our method is to interpret the average over random tensors as the\npartition function of a classical ferromagnetic Ising model, so that the\nminimal surfaces of Ryu-Takayanagi appear as domain walls. Upon including the\nanalog of a bulk field, we find that our model reproduces the expected\ncorrections to the Ryu-Takayanagi formula: the minimal surface is displaced and\nthe entropy is augmented by the entanglement of the bulk field. Increasing the\nentanglement of the bulk field ultimately changes the minimal surface\ntopologically in a way similar to creation of a black hole. Extrapolating bulk\ncorrelation functions to the boundary permits the calculation of the scaling\ndimensions of boundary operators, which exhibit a large gap between a small\nnumber of low-dimension operators and the rest.

In the presence of interactions,\nthis transition transforms into a Many-Body Localization (MBL) transition.\nRecent studies have suggested that this type of transition can also occur in\nmodels with quasi-periodic potentials that possess single particle mobility\nedges. Two such models were studied in PRL 115,230401(2015) but only one was\nfound to exhibit an MBL transition in the presence of interactions while the\nother one did not. In this work we investigate the occurrence of MBL in the\npresence of weak interactions in five different models with single particle\nmobility edges in one dimension with a view to obtaining a criterion for the\nsame.

Generically, the sensitivity of a quantum sensor\nconsisting of $N$ independent particles is proportional to $\\sqrt{N}$. However,\ninteractions invariably occuring at high densities lead to a breakdown of the\nassumption of independence between the particles, posing a severe challenge for\nquantum sensors operating at the nanoscale. Here, we show that interactions in\nquantum sensors can be transformed from a nuisance into an advantage when\nstrong interactions trigger a dissipative phase transition in an open quantum\nsystem. We demonstrate this behavior by analyzing dissipative quantum sensors\nbased upon nitrogen-vacancy defect centers in diamond. Using both a variational\nmethod and numerical simulation of the master equation describing the open\nquantum many-body system, we establish the existence of a dissipative first\norder transition that can be used for quantum sensing. We investigate the\nproperties of this phase transition for two- and three-dimensional setups,\ndemonstrating that the transition can be observed using current experimental\ntechnology. Finally, we show that quantum sensors based on dissipative phase\ntransitions are particularly robust against imperfections such as disorder or\ndecoherence, with the sensitivity of the sensor not being limited by the $T_2$\ncoherence time of the device.

We show how\nthis can be done for both Bosons and Fermions, and for both closed and open\nquantum systems, using additional sources coupled to bilinears of the fields at\nthe initial time, calculating Green's functions in a theory with these sources,\nand then taking appropriate set of derivatives of these Green's functions\nw.r.t. initial sources to obtain physical observables. The set of derivatives\ndepend on the initial density matrix. The physical correlators in a dynamics\nwith arbitrary initial conditions do not satisfy Wick's theorem, even for\nnon-interacting systems.

First, a discontinuous\ntransition occurs with an orbital ordering assisted by the tetragonal\nJahn-Teller distortion. The orbital order reduces the frustration in spin\nexchange interactions, and induces antiferromagnetic correlations in\none-dimensional chains lying in the perpendicular planes to the tetragonal\ndistortion. Secondly, at a lower temperature, a three-dimensional\nantiferromagnetic order sets in continuously, which is stabilized by the\nthird-neighbor interaction among the one-dimensional antiferromagnetic chains.\nThermal fluctuations are crucial to stabilize the collinear magnetic state by\nthe order-by-disorder mechanism.

Abstract: The equations of motion for matter fields are invariant under the shift of\nthe matter lagrangian by a constant.

In the conventional\napproach, gravity breaks this symmetry and the gravitational field equations\nare not invariant under such a shift of the energy momentum tensor. I argue\nthat until this symmetry is restored, one cannot obtain a satisfactory solution\nto the cosmological constant problem. I describe an alternative perspective to\ngravity in which the gravitational field equations are [G_{ab} -\\kappa T_{ab}]\nn^an^b =0 for all null vectors n^a. This is obviously invariant under the\nchange T^a_b --> T^a_b +\\rho \\delta^a_b and restores the symmetry under\nshifting the matter lagrangian by a constant. These equations are equivalent to\nG_{ab} = \\kappa T_{ab} + Cg_{ab} where C is now an integration constant so that\nthe role of the cosmological constant is very different in this approach. The\ncosmological constant now arises as an integration constant, somewhat like the\nmass M in the Schwarzschild metric, the value of which can be chosen depending\non the physical context. These equations can be obtained from a variational\nprinciple which uses the null surfaces of spacetime as local Rindler horizons\nand can be given a thermodynamic interpretation. This approach turns out to be\nquite general and can encompass even the higher order corrections to Einstein's\ngravity and suggests a principle to determine the form of these corrections in\na systematic manner. \n\n"}

The asymptotic values of the\norder parameter only depend on the initial energy density and all values\nbetween the minima of the tree level potential are available, the asymptotic\ndynamical `effective potential' is flat between the minima. When the energy\ndensity is larger than V_0, the evolution samples ergodically the broken\nsymmetry states, as a consequence of non-perturbative particle production via\nparametric amplification. Furthermore, we examine the quantum dynamics of phase\nordering into the broken symmetry phase and find novel scaling behavior of the\ncorrelation function.

In this paper, we approach the system as a Wigner Quantum System, not\nimposing the canonical commutation relations, but using instead weaker\nrelations following from the compatibility of Hamilton's equations and the\nHeisenberg equations.

The task is accomplished in three\nsteps. The first step is the construction of a modified cobar complex adapted\nto a non-coassociative comultiplication. The following two steps each involve a\nnew, highly non-trivial, construction. The first construction, essentially\ncombinatorial, defines a differential graded Lie algebra structure on the\nsimplicial chain complex of the associahedra. The second construction, of a\nmore algebraic nature, is the definition of map of differential graded Lie\nalgebras from the complex defined above to the algebra of derivations on the\nbar resolution. Using the existence of this map and the acyclicity of the\nassociahedra we can define a so-called homotopy comodule structure on the bar\nresolution of a general Drinfeld algebra. This in turn allows us to define the\ndesired cohomology theory in terms of a complex which consists, roughly\nspeaking, of the bimodule and bicomodule maps from the bar resolution to the\nmodified cobar resolution.

Beyond dynamic threshold, the algorithm should take exponentially\nlong time to find a solution. We compare the results for extended and\nsimplified sets of landscapes and provide numerical evidence in support of our\nuniversality ansatz. We have been able to map the ensemble of random graphs\nonto another ensemble with fluctuations significantly reduced. This enabled us\nto obtain tight upper bounds on satisfiability transition and to recompute the\ndynamical transition using the extended set of landscapes. \n\n"}

We realize the braid teleportation configuration, teleportation\nswapping and virtual braid representation in the standard description of the\nteleportation. We devise diagrammatic rules for quantum circuits involving\nmaximally entangled states and apply them to three sorts of descriptions of the\nteleportation: the transfer operator, quantum measurements and characteristic\nequations, and further propose the Temperley--Lieb algebra under local unitary\ntransformations to be a mathematical structure underlying the teleportation. We\ncompare our diagrammatical approach with two known recipes to the quantum\ninformation flow: the teleportation topology and strongly compact closed\ncategory, in order to explain our diagrammatic rules to be a natural\ndiagrammatic language for the teleportation. \n\n"}
