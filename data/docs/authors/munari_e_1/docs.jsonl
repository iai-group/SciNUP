We have performed a cluster analysis of the local\nextrema in the CMB signal to show that the CS is actually associated with a\nlarge group of extrema rather than just one. In the light of this we have\nre-examined the properties of the WMAP ILC and co-added \"cleaned\" WCM maps,\nwhich have previously been used for the analysis of the properties of the\nsignal in the vicinity of the CS. These two maps have remarkably similar\nproperties on equal latitude rings for |b|>30deg, as well as in the vicinity of\nthe CS. We have also checked the idea that the CMB signal has a non-Gaussian\ntail, localized in the low multipole components of the signal. For each ring we\napply a linear filter with characteristic scale R, dividing the CMB signal in\ntwo parts: the filtered part, with characteristic scale above that of the\nfilter R, and the difference between the initial and filtered signal. Using the\nfilter scale as a variable, we can maximize the skewness and kurtosis of the\nsmoothed signal and minimize these statistics for the difference between\ninitial and filtered signal. We have discovered that the shape of the CS is\nformed primarily by the components of the CMB signal represented by multipoles\nbetween 10<=L<=20, with a corresponding angular scale about 5-10 degs. This\nsignal leads to modulation of the whole CMB sky, clearly seen at |b|>30deg in\nboth the ILC and WCM maps, rather than a single localized feature. After\nsubtraction of this modulation, the remaining part of the CMB signal appears to\nbe consistent with statistical homogeneity and Gaussianity. \n\n"}

A vast array of\nscience will be enabled by a single wide-deep-fast sky survey, and LSST will\nhave unique survey capability in the faint time domain. The LSST design is\ndriven by four main science themes: probing dark energy and dark matter, taking\nan inventory of the Solar System, exploring the transient optical sky, and\nmapping the Milky Way. LSST will be a wide-field ground-based system sited at\nCerro Pach\\'{o}n in northern Chile. The telescope will have an 8.4 m (6.5 m\neffective) primary mirror, a 9.6 deg$^2$ field of view, and a 3.2 Gigapixel\ncamera. The standard observing sequence will consist of pairs of 15-second\nexposures in a given field, with two such visits in each pointing in a given\nnight. With these repeats, the LSST system is capable of imaging about 10,000\nsquare degrees of sky in a single filter in three nights. The typical 5$\\sigma$\npoint-source depth in a single visit in $r$ will be $\\sim 24.5$ (AB). The\nproject is in the construction phase and will begin regular survey operations\nby 2022. The survey area will be contained within 30,000 deg$^2$ with\n$\\delta<+34.5^\\circ$, and will be imaged multiple times in six bands, $ugrizy$,\ncovering the wavelength range 320--1050 nm.

The host\ngalaxy color preferred by AGNs is u-r ~2.0 for early-type hosts and u-r=2.0-2.4\nfor late-type hosts.

With the assumption that radio and X-ray\nluminosity are suitable proxies for jet power and accretion power,\nrespectively, a broad fundamental connection between accretion and jet\nproduction is implied. In an effort to refine these links and enhance their\npower, we have explored the above relations exclusively among black holes with\ndirect, dynamical mass-measurements.

Abstract: We use a suite of semi-empirical models to predict galaxy merger rates and\ncontributions to bulge growth as functions of merger mass, redshift, and mass\nratio. The models use empirical halo occupation constraints to identify\nmergers, together with high-resolution simulations to quantify how mergers with\ndifferent properties contribute to the bulge population. We find good agreement\nwith a variety of observational constraints, and provide fitting functions for\nmerger rates and contributions to bulge growth. We identify several robust\nconclusions. (1) Major mergers dominate formation and assembly of L* bulges and\nthe spheroid mass density, minor mergers contribute ~30%. (2) This is\nmass-dependent: bulge formation is dominated by more minor mergers in\nlower-mass systems. At higher masses, bulges form in major mergers near L*, but\nsubsequently assemble in minor mergers. (3) The minor/major contribution is\nalso morphology-dependent: higher B/T systems form in more major mergers, lower\nB/T systems form in situ from minor mergers. (4) Low-mass galaxies, being\ngas-rich, require more major mergers to reach the same B/T as high-mass\nsystems. (5) Absolute merger rates increase with galaxy mass. (6) Predicted\nrates agree well with observations, but suggest that some morphology-selected\nsamples include contamination from minor mergers. (7) Predicted rates agree\nwith integrated growth in bulge mass with cosmic time, but with factor ~2\nuncertainty - half the bulge mass density could come from non-mergers.

This AGN-like source is known to feature three sets of\nemission lines at zem = 0.6972, 0.7020 and 0.7128.

We test\nthese scenarios by comparing our spectra with that from the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey (SDSS), obtained 4 years prior to our observations. Comparing the\nredshifts of [OIII]4960,5008 we put a 3 sigma limit on the relative\nacceleration to be less than 32 km s^-1 yr^-1 between different emitting\nregions. Using the 2D spectra obtained at different position angles we show\nthat the [OIII]5008 line from the zem = 0.7128 component is extended beyond the\nspectral point spread function.

If the inner disc radius we measure (<=3.8\ngravitational radii) is identified with the innermost stable circular orbit of\nthe black hole spacetime, we infer that the black hole powering RBS 1124 is\nrotating rapidly with spin a>= 0.6. The soft excess contribution in the 0.5-2\nkeV band is ~15%, about half than that typically observed in unobscured Seyfert\n1 galaxies and quasars, in line with the low disc reflection fraction we\nmeasure (R_disc ~0.4).

We combine\nthe very deep optical to near-Infrared photometry from the HST ACS and NICMOS\ncameras with mid-Infrared Spitzer IRAC imaging available through the GOODS\nprogram. After carefully removing the flux from contaminating foreground\nsources we have obtained reliable photometry in the 3.6 and 4.5 micron IRAC\nchannels. The spectral shapes of these sources, including their rest frame\noptical colors, strongly support their being at z~7 with a mean photometric\nredshift of <z>=7.2+/-0.5.

We find stellar masses that range over 0.1 -12x10^9 M_sol and\naverage ages from 20 Myr to up to 425 Myr with a mean of ~300 Myr, suggesting\nthat in some of these galaxies most of the stars were formed at z>8 (and\nprobably at z>~10). The best fits to the observed SEDs are consistent with\nlittle or no dust extinction, in agreement with recent results at z~4-8. The\nstar formation rates (SFR) are in the range from 5-20 M_sol/yr. From this\nsample we measure a stellar mass density of 6.6_{-3.3}^{+5.4}x10^5 M_sol/Mpc^3\nto a limit of M_{UV,AB}<-20 (or 0.4 L*(z=3)).

The entropy profiles are robustly measured at least out to\nR_1000 in all systems and out to R_500 in 13 systems. Compared to theoretical\nexpectations, the observed distributions show a radial and mass-dependent\nexcess entropy that is greater and extends to larger radii in lower mass\nsystems. At R_500, the mass dependence and entropy excess are both negligible\nwithin the uncertainties. Mirroring this behaviour, the scaling of gas entropy\nis shallower than self-similar in the inner regions, but steepens with radius,\nbecoming consistent with self-similar at R_500. The dispersion in scaled\nentropy in the inner regions is linked to the presence of cool cores and\ndynamical activity; at larger radii the dispersion decreases by a factor of two\nand the dichotomy between subsamples disappears.

Abstract: For any assumed stellar Initial Mass Function, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\n(SDSS) gives a precise determination of the stellar mass function of galaxies\nfor 10^8 M_sun < M_* < 10^12 M_sun. Within the concordance LCDM cosmology, the\nMillennium simulations give a precise halo mass function for all halos within\nwhich galaxies can form. Under the plausible hypothesis that the stellar mass\nof a galaxy is an increasing function of the maximum mass ever attained by its\nhalo, these combine to give halo mass as a function of stellar mass. The result\nagrees quite well with observational estimates of mean halo mass as a function\nof stellar mass from stacking analyses of the gravitational lensing signal and\nthe satellite dynamics of SDSS galaxies. For M_* ~ 5.5 x 10^10 M_sun, the\nstellar mass usually assumed for the Milky Way, the implied halo mass is ~ 2 x\n10^12 M_sun, consistent with most recent direct estimates and inferences from\nthe MW/M31 Timing Argument. The fraction of the baryons associated with each\nhalo which are present as stars in its central galaxy reaches a maximum of 20%\nat masses somewhat below that of the Milky Way, and falls rapidly at both\nhigher and lower masses. These conversion efficiencies are lower than in almost\nall recent high-resolution simulations of galaxy formation, showing that these\nare not yet viable models for the formation of typical members of the galaxy\npopulation. When inserted in the Millennium-II Simulation, our derived relation\nbetween stellar mass and halo mass predicts a stellar mass autocorrelation\nfunction in excellent agreement with that measured directly in the SDSS. The\nimplied Tully-Fisher relation also appears consistent with observation,\nsuggesting that galaxy luminosity functions and Tully-Fisher relations can be\nreproduced simultaneously in a LCDM cosmology. \n\n"}

The bulge and thick disks of modern\ngalaxies may form this way. Simulations of minor mergers make thick disks too,\nbut there is an important difference. Thick disks made by internal processes\nhave a constant scale height with galactocentric radius, but thick disks made\nby mergers flare. The difference arises because in the first case,\nperpendicular forcing and disk-gravity resistance are both proportional to the\ndisk column density, so the resulting scale height is independent of this\ndensity. In the case of mergers, perpendicular forcing is independent of the\ncolumn density and the low density regions get thicker; the resulting flaring\nis inconsistent with observations. Late-stage gas accretion and thin disk\ngrowth are shown to preserve the constant scale heights of thick disks formed\nby internal evolution.

An adiabatic feedback mechanism was adopted where gas cooling\nwas prevented to generate galactic winds without explicit wind particles. The\nsimulations produced a cosmic star formation history (SFH) that is broadly\nconsistent with observations until z $\\sim$ 0.5, and a steady evolution of the\nuniversal neutral hydrogen fraction ($\\Omega_{\\rm H I}$). At z=0, about 40% of\nthe baryons are in the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM), but most metals\n(80%-90%) are locked in stars. At higher z the proportion of metals in the IGM\nis higher due to more efficient loss from galaxies. The IGM metals primarily\nreside in the WHIM throughout cosmic history. The metallicity evolution of the\ngas inside galaxies is broadly consistent with observations, but the diffuse\nIGM is under enriched at z $\\sim$ 2.5. Galactic winds most efficiently enrich\nthe IGM for halos in the intermediate mass range $10^{10}$M$_{\\sun}$ -\n$10^{11}$ M$_{\\sun}$. At the low mass end gas is prevented from accreting onto\nhalos and has very low metallicities. At the high mass end, the fraction of\nhalo baryons escaped as winds declines along with the decline of stellar mass\nfraction of the galaxies. This is likely because of the decrease in star\nformation activity and in wind escape efficiency. Metals enhance cooling which\nallows WHIM gas to cool onto galaxies and increases star formation. Metal\ndiffusion allows winds to mix prior to escape, decreasing the IGM metal content\nin favour of gas within galactic halos and star forming gas.

At present, groups contain most of the galaxies and a significant\nfraction of the overall baryon content of the universe.

We demonstrate this approach by examining the recent\nclaim of 0912.0552 regarding the possible DM origin of the 2.5 keV line in\nChandra observations of the Milky Way satellite known as Willman 1. Our\nconservative strategy is to adopt a relatively large dark mass for Willman 1\nand relatively small dark masses for the comparison objects. We analyze\narchival observations by XMM-Newton of M31 and Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy\n(dSph) and Chandra observations of Sculptor dSph. By performing a conservative\nanalysis of X-ray spectra, we show the absence of a DM decay line with\nparameters consistent with those of 0912.0552. For M31, the observations of the\nregions between 10 and 20 kpc from the center, where the uncertainties in the\nDM distribution are minimal, make a strong exclusion at the level above\n10sigma. The minimal estimate for the amount of DM in the central 40 kpc of M31\nis provided by the model of 0912.4133, assuming the stellar disk's mass to\nlight ratio ~8 and almost constant DM density within a core of 28 kpc. Even in\nthis case one gets an exclusion at 5.7sigma from central region of M31 whereas\nmodeling all processed data from M31 and Fornax produces more than 14sigma\nexclusion. Therefore, despite possible systematic uncertainties, we exclude the\npossibility that the spectral feature at ~2.5 keV found in 0912.0552 is a DM\ndecay line. We conclude, however, that the search for DM decay line, although\ndemanding prolonged observations of well-studied dSphs, M31 outskirts and other\nsimilar objects, is rather promising, as the nature of a possible signal can be\nchecked. An (expected) non-observation of a DM decay signal in the planned\nobservations of Willman 1 should not discourage further dedicated observations. \n\n"}

It is thus reasonable to expect statistical\nisotropy violation in the CMB photon distribution observed now to have\noriginated from SI violation in the baryon-photon fluid at last scattering, in\naddition to anisotropy of the primordial power spectrum studied earlier in\nliterature.\n  We consider the generalized anisotropic brightness distribution fluctuations,\n$\\Delta(\\vec{k}, \\hat{n}, \\tau)$ (at conformal time $\\tau$) in contrast to the\nSI case where it is simply a function of $|\\vec{k}|$ and $\\hat{k} \\cdot\n\\hat{n}$. The brightness fluctuations expanded in Bipolar Spherical Harmonic\n(BipoSH) series, can then be written as $\\Delta_{\\ell_1 \\ell_2}^{L M}(\\vec{k},\n\\tau)$ where $L > 0$ terms encode deviations from statistical isotropy.

We find that SNe lead to accretion in the disk at a\nrate of roughly 0.1 - 1 M_Sun per year and induce star formation at a rate of ~\n10 - 100 M_Sun per year which contributes to the formation of a bulge; a part\nof the stellar velocity dispersion is due to the speed of SNa shells from which\nstars are formed and a part due to the repeated action of the stochastic\ngravitational field of the network of SNa remnants on stars.

The\nnulling technique is a model-independent method developed to eliminate\nintrinsic-shear alignment at the two-point level. In this paper we demonstrate\nthat the nulling technique can also be naturally generalized to the three-point\nlevel, controlling the corresponding GGI systematics. We show that under the\nassumption of exact redshift information the intrinsic-shear alignment\ncontamination can be completely eliminated. To show how well the nulling\ntechnique performs on data with limited redshift information, we apply the\nnulling technique to three-point weak lensing statistics from a fictitious\nsurvey analogous to a typical future deep imaging survey, in which the\nthree-point intrinsic-shear alignment systematics is generated from a power-law\ntoy model. Using 10 redshift bins, the nulling technique leads to a factor of\n10 suppression of the GGI/GGG ratio, and reduces the bias on cosmological\nparameters to less than the original statistical error. More detailed redshift\ninformation allowing for finer redshift bins leads to better reduction of bias.\nThe information loss during the nulling procedure doubles the statistical error\non cosmological parameters. A comparison of the nulling technique with an\nunconditioned compression of the data suggests that part of the information\nloss can be retained by considering higher-order nulling weights during the\nnulling procedure.

Our analysis suggests that\ninfrared-to-radio luminosity ratios of SMGs do not change up to redshift ~5 and\nare lower by a factor of ~2.1 than the value corresponding to the local\nIR-radio correlation. However, we also find dissimilarities between z>4 and\nlower-redshift SMGs. Those at z>4 tend to be among the most star-forming, least\nmassive and hottest (~60 K) SMGs and exhibit the highest fraction of stellar\nmass formed in the ongoing starburst (~45%).

Our results show that the strongest trend is between the star\nformation rate and the dilution of the metals in the nuclear region; i.e., the\nmore intense the central burst of star formation, the more the gas is diluted.\nThis trend comes from strong inflows of relatively metal-poor gas from the\nouter regions of both disks, which fuels the intense star formation and lowers\nthe overall metallicity for a time. The strong inflows happen on timescales of\nabout 10^8 years or less, and the most intense star formation and lowest gas\nphase metallicities are seen generally after the first pericentre passage. As\nthe star formation proceeds and the merger advances, the dilution reduces and\nenrichment becomes dominant - ultimately increasing the metallicity of the\ncircumnuclear gas to a level higher than the initial metallicities of the\nmerging galaxies. The \"fly-bys\" - pairs that interact but do not merge - also\ncause some dilution. We even see some dilution early in the merger or in the\n\"fly-bys\" and thus do not observe a strong trend between the nuclear\nmetallicities and separation in our simulations until the merger is well\nadvanced. We also analyse the O and Fe enrichment of the ISM, and show that the\nevolution of the alpha/Fe ratios, as well as the dilution of the central gas\nmetallicity, can be used as a clock for \"dating\" the interaction. \n\n"}

If however (sub)halo masses are not\nappropriately defined or are under-resolved, the major merger rate can be\ndramatically suppressed. The dominant differences in galaxy merger rates owe to\nbaryonic physics. Hydrodynamic simulations without feedback and older models\nthat do not agree with the observed galaxy mass function propagate factor ~5\nbias in the resulting merger rates. However, if the model matches the galaxy\nmass function, properties of central galaxies are sufficiently converged to\ngive small differences in merger rates. But variations in baryonic physics of\nsatellites also have dramatic effects. The known problem of satellite\n'over-quenching' in most semi-analytic models (SAMs), whereby SAM satellites\nare too efficiently stripped of gas, could lead to order-of-magnitude\nunder-estimates of merger rates for low-mass, gas-rich galaxies.

A widely adopted parameterization of the SFH, the\nso-called tau-models where SFR goes as e^{-t/tau) is shown to lead to\nunrealistically low ages when applied to star forming galaxies at z ~ 2, a\nproblem shared by other SFHs when the age is left as a free parameter in the\nfitting. This happens because the SED of such galaxies, at all wavelengths, is\ndominated by their youngest stellar populations, which outshine the older ones.\nThus, the SED of such galaxies conveys little information on the beginning of\nstar formation. To cope with this problem, we explore a variety of SFHs, such\nas constant SFR and inverted-tau models - with SFR as e^{+t/tau) - along with\nvarious priors on age, including assuming that star formation started at high\nredshift in all the galaxies. We find that inverted-tau models with such latter\nassumption give SFRs and extinctions in excellent agreement with the values\nderived using only the UV part of the SED. These models are also shown to\naccurately recover the SFRs and masses of mock galaxies at z ~ 2 constructed\nfrom semi-analytic models. All other explored SFH templates do not fulfil these\ntwo test. In particular, direct-tau models with unconstrained age in the\nfitting procedure overstimate SFRs and underestimate stellar mass, and would\nexacerbate an apparent mismatch between the cosmic evolution of the volume\ndensities of SFR and stellar mass. We conclude that for high-redshift star\nforming galaxies an exponentially increasing SFR with a high formation redshift\nis preferable to other forms of the SFH so far adopted in the literature. \n\n"}

Optical and NIR color gradients in Early-type galaxies: New\n  Insights into Correlations with Galaxy Properties Abstract: We present an analysis of stellar population gradients in 4,546 Early-Type\nGalaxies with photometry in $grizYHJK$ along with optical spectroscopy. A new\napproach is described which utilizes color information to constrain age and\nmetallicity gradients. Defining an effective color gradient, $\\nabla_{\\star}$,\nwhich incorporates all of the available color indices, we investigate how\n$\\nabla_{\\star}$ varies with galaxy mass proxies, i.e. velocity dispersion,\nstellar (M_star) and dynamical (M_dyn) masses, as well as age, metallicity, and\nalpha/Fe. ETGs with M_dyn larger than 8.5 x 10^10, M_odot have increasing age\ngradients and decreasing metallicity gradients wrt mass, metallicity, and\nenhancement. We find that velocity dispersion and alpha/Fe are the main drivers\nof these correlations. ETGs with 2.5 x 10^10 M_odot =< M_dyn =< 8.5 x 10^10\nM_odot, show no correlation of age, metallicity, and color gradients wrt mass,\nalthough color gradients still correlate with stellar population parameters,\nand these correlations are independent of each other. In both mass regimes, the\nstriking anti-correlation between color gradient and alpha-enhancement is\nsignificant at \\sim 4sigma, and results from the fact that metallicity gradient\ndecreases with alpha/Fe. This anti-correlation may reflect the fact that star\nformation and metallicity enrichment are regulated by the interplay between the\nenergy input from supernovae, and the temperature and pressure of the hot X-ray\ngas in ETGs. For all mass ranges, positive age gradients are associated with\nold galaxies (>5-7 Gyr). For galaxies younger than \\sim 5 Gyr, mostly at\nlow-mass, the age gradient tends to be anti-correlated with the Age parameter,\nwith more positive gradients at younger ages. \n\n"}

After the binary orbit decays due to an interaction\nwith a massive circumbinary disk, the binary is decoupled from the circumbinary\ndisk because the orbital-decay timescale due to emission of gravitational wave\nbecomes shorter than the viscous timescale evaluated at the inner edge of\ncircumbinary disk. During the subsequent evolution, the accretion disk, which\nis truncated at the tidal radius because of the tidal torque, also shrinks as\nthe orbital decay. Assuming that the disk mass changed by this process is all\naccreted, the disk becomes radiatively inefficient when the semi-major axis is\nseveral hundred Schwarzschild radii. The high-energy radiations, in spite of a\nlow bolometric luminosity, are emitted from an accretion disk around each black\nhole long before the black hole coalescence as well as the gravitational wave\nsignals. The synchrotron process can notably produce potentially observable\nradio emissions at large distances if there is a strong, dipole magnetic field\naround each black hole. In unequal mass-ratio binaries, step-like light\nvariations are seen in the observed light curve because the luminosity is\nhigher and its duration time are shorter in the radio emission by the disk\naround the secondary black hole than those of the primary black hole. Such a\nprecursor would be unique to not a single black hole system but a binary black\nhole system, and implies that binary black holes finally merge without\naccretion disks. \n\n"}

The most popular interpretation of the MSP is that\nthe smallest dark matter halos in the universe are extremely inefficient at\nforming stars. The question from that standpoint is to identify the feedback\nsource that makes small halos dark and to identify any obvious mass scale where\nthe truncation in the efficiency of galaxy formation occurs. Among the most\nexciting developments in near-field cosmology in recent years is the discovery\nof a new population satellite galaxies orbiting the Milky Way and M31. Wide\nfield, resolved star surveys have more than doubled the dwarf satellite count\nin less than a decade, revealing a population of ultrafaint galaxies that are\nless luminous that some star clusters. For the first time, there are empirical\nreasons to believe that there really are missing satellite galaxies in the\nLocal Group, lurking just beyond our ability to detect them, or simply\ninhabiting a region of the sky that has yet to have been surveyed.

The MeV tails observed in GBHs provide evidence in favour of\nnon-thermal electron tails and it is possible that such electrons are also\npresent in the X-ray emitting regions of AGNs. Using simulations with the\nkinetic code that self-consistently models electron and photon distributions,\nwe find that the power-law-like X-ray spectra in AGNs can be explained in terms\nof the synchrotron self-Compton radiation of hybrid thermal/non-thermal\nelectrons, similarly to the hard/low state of GBHs. Under a very broad range of\nparameters the model predicts a rather narrow distribution of photon spectral\nslopes consistent with that observed from LINERs and Seyferts at luminosities\nless than 3 per cent of the Eddington luminosity. The entire infrared to X-ray\nspectrum of these objects can be described in terms of our model, suggesting a\ntight correlation between the two energy bands.

It has been unclear\nwhether they do or do not correlate with black holes in the same way that\nbulges do, because too few pseudobulges were classified to provide a clear\nresult. At stake are conclusions about which parts of galaxies coevolve with\nblack holes, possibly by being regulated by energy feedback from black holes.\nHere we report pseudobulge classifications for galaxies with dynamically\ndetected black holes and combine them with recent measurements of velocity\ndispersions in the biggest bulgeless galaxies.

We suggest that there are two different modes of black\nhole feeding. Black holes in bulges grow rapidly to high masses when mergers\ndrive gas infall that feeds quasar-like events. In contrast, small black holes\nin bulgeless galaxies and galaxies with pseudobulges grow as low-level\nSeyferts.

The MultiDark (or\nBigBolshoi) simulation is introduced in this paper. This suite of simulations\nwith high mass resolution over a large volume allows us to compute with\nunprecedented accuracy the concentration over a large range of scales (about\nsix orders of magnitude in mass), which constitutes the state-of-the-art of our\ncurrent knowledge on this basic property of dark matter halos in the LCDM\ncosmology.

The concentration\nc(M,z) as a function of mass and the redshift and for different cosmological\nparameters shows a remarkably complex pattern. However, when expressed in terms\nof the linear rms fluctuation of the density field sigma(M,z), the halo\nconcentration c(sigma) shows a nearly-universal simple U-shaped behaviour with\na minimum at a well defined scale at sigma=0.71.

Using\nour new dynamical approach, we find an upturn in the mass-loss vs. Gamma\ndependence, at the point where the winds become optically thick. This coincides\nwith the location where wind efficiency numbers surpass the single-scattering\nlimit of Eta = 1, reaching values up to Eta = 2.5. Our modelling suggests a\ntransition from common O-type winds to Wolf-Rayet characteristics at the point\nwhere the winds become optically thick. This transitional behaviour is also\nrevealed with respect to the wind acceleration parameter beta, which starts at\nvalues below 1 for the optically thin O-stars, and naturally reaches values as\nhigh as 1.5-2 for the optically thick Wolf-Rayet models. An additional finding\nconcerns the transition in spectral morphology of the Of and WN characteristic\nHe II line at 4686 Angstrom.

Using simple observationally-motivated heating\nprescriptions, we show that local thermal instability (TI) can produce a\nmulti-phase medium---with ~ 10000 K cold filaments condensing out of the hot\nICM---only when the ratio of the TI timescale in the hot plasma (t_{TI}) to the\nfree-fall timescale (t_{ff}) satisfies t_{TI}/t_{ff} <~ 10. This criterion\nquantitatively explains why cold gas and star formation are preferentially\nobserved in low-entropy clusters and groups. In addition, the interplay among\nheating, cooling, and TI reduces the net cooling rate and the mass accretion\nrate at small radii by factors of ~ 100 relative to cooling-flow models. This\ndramatic reduction is in line with observations. The feedback efficiency\nrequired to prevent a cooling-flow is ~ 0.001 for clusters and decreases for\nlower mass halos; supernova heating may be energetically sufficient to balance\ncooling in galactic halos. We further argue that the ICM self-adjusts so that\nt_{TI}/t_{ff} >~ 10 at all radii. When this criterion is not satisfied, cold\nfilaments condense out of the hot phase and reduce the density of the ICM.\nThese cold filaments can power the black hole and/or stellar feedback required\nfor global thermal balance, which drives t_{TI}/t_{ff} >~ 10. In comparison to\nclusters, groups have central cores with lower densities and larger radii. This\ncan account for the deviations from self-similarity in the X-ray\nluminosity-temperature (L_X-T_X) relation.

For example, it was suggested that\nadiabatic contraction of baryonic gas makes the dark matter cusp steeper.\nHowever, it is still an open question if the gas falls into the galactic centre\nin smooth adiabatic manner.

A further improvement is achieved by allowing a dark\nenergy equation of state parameter w<-1.

The resulting fragmentation masses\nare > 10 Msun. The inclusion of Fe and Si cooling does not affect the thermal\nevolution as this is dominated by molecular cooling even for metallicities as\nlarge as Z = 10^{-2} Zsun. The presence of dust is the key driver for the\nformation of low-mass stars. We focus on three representative core-collapse\nsupernova (SN) progenitors, and consider the effects of reverse shocks of\nincreasing strength: these reduce the depletion factors, fdep =\nMdust/(Mdust+Mmet), alter the shape of the grain size distribution function and\nmodify the relative abundances of grain species and of metal species in the gas\nphase. We find that the lowest metallicity at which fragmentation occurs is\nZ=10^{-6} Zsun for gas pre-enriched by the explosion of a 20 Msun primordial SN\n(fdep > 0.22) and/or by a 35 Msun, Z=10^{-4} Zsun SN (fdep > 0.26); it is ~ 1\ndex larger, when the gas is pre-enriched by a Z = 10^{-4} Zsun, 20 Msun SN\n(fdep > 0.04).

It\nwas found that the model demonstrates a counter-example to the cosmic no-hair\ntheorem since there exists a stable anisotropically inflationary fix-point. One\nof the great triumphs of inflation, however, is that it explains the observed\nflatness and isotropy of the universe today without requiring special initial\nconditions. Any acceptable model for inflation should thus explain these\nobservations in a satisfactory way. To check whether the model meets this\nrequirement, we introduce curvature to the background geometry and consider\naxisymmetric spacetimes of Bianchi type II,III and the Kantowski-Sachs metric.\nWe show that the anisotropic Bianchi type I fix-point is an attractor for the\nentire family of such spacetimes. The model is predictive in the sense that the\nuniverse gets close to this fix-point after a few e-folds for a wide range of\ninitial conditions. If inflation lasts for N e-folds, the curvature at the end\nof inflation is typically of order exp(-2N). The anisotropy in the expansion\nrate at the end of inflation, on the other hand, while being small on the\none-percent level, is highly significant. We show that after the end of\ninflation there will be a period of isotropization lasting for about 2N/3\ne-folds.

We show\nthat there is a range of black-hole masses (M_bh ~ 10^3-10^5 solar masses)\nwhere the accretion flow traps radiation, corresponding to black-holes that\nwere massive enough to generate a photon trapping accretion flow, but small\nenough that their Bondi radii did not exceed the isothermal scale height of\nself-gravitating gas. Under these conditions we find that the accretion reaches\nlevels far in excess of the Eddington rate. A prediction of this scenario is\nthat X-ray number counts of active galactic nuclei at z>6 would exhibit a\ncutoff at the low luminosities corresponding to black-hole masses below ~10^5\nsolar masses.

The\npurely passive fading of existing red sequence galaxies, with no further\nmergers or star formation, results in dramatic changes at the bright end of the\nluminosity function and color-magnitude relation. Without mergers there is too\nmuch evolution in luminosity at a fixed space density compared to observations.\nThe change in color and magnitude at a fixed mass resemble that of a passively\nevolving population that formed relatively recently, at z~2. Mergers amongst\nthe red sequence population (\"dry mergers\") occurring after z=1 build up mass,\ncounteracting the fading of the existing stellar populations to give smaller\nchanges in both color and luminosity for massive galaxies.

We use our surface photometry data to analyze\nthe possible reasons for the anomalous M/L.

We focus in particular on the total neutrino mass as\nconstrained by a combination of the galaxy cluster number counts and\ncorrelation function. For the latter we consider only the shape information and\nthe Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), while marginalising over the spectral\namplitude and the redshift space distortions. In addition to the cosmological\nparameters of the standard LCDM+nu model we also consider a non-vanishing\ncurvature, and two parameters describing a redshift evolution for the dark\nenergy equation of state. For completeness, we also marginalise over a set of\n\"nuisance\" parameters, representing the uncertainties on the cluster mass\ndetermination. We find that combining cluster counts with power spectrum\ninformation greatly improves the constraining power of each probe taken\nindividually, with errors on cosmological parameters being reduced by up to an\norder of magnitude. In particular, the best improvements are for the parameters\ndefining the dynamical evolution of dark energy, where cluster counts break\ndegeneracies. Moreover, the resulting error on neutrino mass is at the level of\n\\sigma(M_\\nu)\\sim 0.9 eV, comparable with that derived from present Ly-alpha\nforest measurements and Cosmic Microwave background (CMB) data in the framework\nof a non-flat Universe.

The standard\nprocedures used to measure shapes involve smoothing and binning of data and\nthus may not be sufficient to detect structural properties like bars, which are\nusually subtle in low surface brightness systems. Taking advantage of the fact\nthat in nearby dwarfs photometry of individual stars is available we introduce\ndiscrete measures of shape based on the two-dimensional inertia tensor and the\nFourier bar mode. We apply these measures of shape first to a variety of\nsimulated dwarf galaxies formed via tidal stirring of disks embedded in dark\nmatter halos and orbiting the Milky Way. In addition to strong mass loss and\nrandomization of stellar orbits, the disks undergo morphological transformation\nthat typically involves the formation of a triaxial bar after the first\npericenter passage. These tidally induced bars persist for a few Gyr before\nbeing shortened towards a more spherical shape if the tidal force is strong\nenough. We test this prediction by measuring in a similar way the shape of\nnearby dwarf galaxies, satellites of the Milky Way. We detect inner bars in\nUrsa Minor, Sagittarius, LMC and possibly Carina.

Inflationary parameters are related to the Majorana and Dirac\ncouplings responsible for neutrino masses with the scale of inflation set by a\nright-handed neutrino mass $M_{\\nu^c} \\sim 10^6-10^{12}$ GeV. Tuning of the\nneutrino Dirac and Majorana superpotential couplings and soft Susy breaking\nparameters is required to enforce flatness of the inflationary potential.

Thus\nsince $M_{\\nu^c}>>M_{Susy}$ the tuning condition is almost independent of the\nsoft supersymmetry breaking parameters and therefore more stable. The required\nfine tuning is also less stringent than for Minimal SUSY Standard Model (MSSM)\ninflation or Dirac neutrino 'A-term\" inflation scenarios due to the much larger\nvalue of the inflaton mass.

While these are likely signatures of\nquasar outflows, the lifetimes of such compact absorbers are too short for them\nto be direct ejecta from a nuclear wind.

The formation of heavy seeds, allowed by the\nLyman-Werner radiative feedback in the quasar-forming environment, is crucial\nto achieve a fast growth of the SMBH by merger events in the early phases of\nits evolution, i.e. z>7. The UV photon production is largely dominated by stars\nin galaxies, i.e. black hole accretion radiation is sub-dominant.\nInterestingly, we find that the final mass of light BHs and of the SMBH in the\nquasar is roughly equal by z=6; by the same time only 19% of the initial baryon\ncontent has been converted into stars. The SMBH growth is dominated at all\nepochs z > 7.2 by mergers (exceeding accretion by a factor 2-50); at later\ntimes accretion becomes by far the most important growth channel.

Evidence for\n  Downsizing of Spin Evolution Abstract: The spin is an important but poorly constrained parameter for describing\nsupermassive black holes (SMBHs). Using the continuity equation of SMBH number\ndensity, we explicitly obtain the mass-dependent cosmological evolution of the\nradiative efficiency for accretion, which serves as a proxy for SMBH spin. Our\ncalculations make use of the SMBH mass function of active and inactive galaxies\n(derived in the first paper of this series), the bolometric luminosity function\nof active galactic nuclei (AGNs), corrected for the contribution from\nCompton-thick sources, and the observed Eddington ratio distribution. We find\nthat the radiative efficiency generally increases with increasing black hole\nmass at high redshifts (z>~1), roughly as \\eta \\propto M_bh^0.5, while the\ntrend reverses at lower redshifts, such that the highest efficiencies are\nattained by the lowest mass black holes. Black holes with M_bh>~10^8.5M_sun\nmaintain radiative efficiencies as high as \\eta~0.3-0.4 at high redshifts, near\nthe maximum for rapidly spinning systems, but their efficiencies drop\ndramatically (by an order of magnitude) by z~0. The pattern for lower mass\nholes is somewhat more complicated but qualitatively similar. Assuming that the\nstandard accretion disk model applies, we suggest that the accretion history of\nSMBHs and their accompanying spins evolve in two distinct regimes: an early\nphase of prolonged accretion, plausibly driven by major mergers, during which\nthe black hole spins up, then switching to a period of random, episodic\naccretion, governed by minor mergers and internal secular processes, during\nwhich the hole spins down. The transition epoch depends on mass, mirroring\nother evidence for \"cosmic downsizing\" in the AGN population; it occurs at z~2\nfor high-mass black holes, and somewhat later, at z~1, for lower-mass systems. \n\n"}

Recent numerical simulations indicate that assembly of a typical\nfirst galaxy with virial temperature (~10^4K) proceeds via cold and dense flows\npenetrating deep to the center, where the supersonic streams collide each other\nto develop a hot and dense (~10^4K, ~10^3/cc) shocked gas. The post-shock layer\nfirst cools by efficient Ly alpha emission and contracts isobarically until\n8000K. Whether the layer continues the isobaric contraction depends on the\ndensity at this moment: if the density is high enough for collisionally\nexciting H2 rovibrational levels (>10^4/cc), enhanced H2 collisional\ndissociation suppresses the gas to cool further. In this case, the layer\nfragments into massive (>10^5Msun) clouds, which collapse isothermally (~8000K)\nby the Ly alpha cooling without subsequent fragmentation. As an outcome, SMSs\nare expected to form and evolve eventually to seeds of supermassive black holes\n(SMBH). By calculating thermal evolution of the post-shock gas, we delimit the\nrange of post-shock conditions for the SMS formation, which can be expressed\nas: T>6000K/(n/10^4/cc) for n<10^4/cc and T>5000-6000K for n>10^4/cc, depending\nsomewhat on initial ionization degree.

We focus\non the possibility that the coupling between the in-streaming gas and the disc\nis maximal, e.g., via dense clumps, and ask whether the streams could be the\ndriver of turbulence in an unstable disc with a Toomre parameter Q~1. Our\nfiducial model assumes an efficiency of ~0.5 per dynamical time for the decay\nof turbulence energy, and ~0.02 for each of the processes that deplete the disc\ngas, i.e., star formation, outflow, and inflow within the disc into a central\nbulge. In this case, the in-streaming drives a ratio of turbulent to rotation\nvelocity sigma/V~0.2-0.3, which at z~2 induces an instability with Q~1, both as\nobserved. However, in conflict with observations, this model predicts that\nsigma/V remains constant with time, independent of the cosmological accretion\nrate, because mass and turbulence have the same external source. Such strongly\ncoupled cosmological inflow tends to stabilize the disc at low z, with Q ~ a\nfew, which may be consistent with observations. The instability could instead\nbe maintained for longer, with a properly declining sigma/V, if it is\nself-regulated to oscillations about Q~1 by a duty cycle for disc depletion.\nHowever, the 'off' phases of this duty cycle become long at low z, which may be\nhard to reconcile with observations. Alternatively, the coupling between the\nin-streaming gas and the disc may weaken in time, reflecting an evolving nature\nof the accretion. If, instead, that coupling is weak at all times, the likely\nenergy source for self-regulated stirring up of the turbulence is the inflow\nwithin the disc down the potential gradient (studied in a companion paper). \n\n"}

We search for HVC absorption in HST high resolution\nultraviolet spectra of a carefully selected sample of 133 AGN using a range of\natomic species in different ionization stages.

Using the latest\ncosmological data sets we find that MG parameters are correlated with the\ncurvature parameter $\\Omega_k$ and the constraints on the MG parameters are\nweakened compared to when $\\Omega_k$ is not included in the parameter analysis.\nWe next use various future simulated data sets, including cosmic microwave\nbackground, weak lensing, and Integrated Sachs-Wolfe-galaxy cross-correlations,\nwhere the fiducial model is spatially curved but we assume a flat model when\nfitting the MG parameters. We find the assumption of a spatially flat model on\na spatially curved universe does indeed cause an artificial shift in the\nconstraints on the MG parameters, in some cases even producing an apparent\ndeviation from GR in the MG parameter space. For our simulated data, tension\nwith GR begins to manifest itself for fiducial models with $\\abs{\\Omega_k} \\geq\n0.02$ and apparent deviations appear for $\\abs{\\Omega_k} \\geq 0.05$. We find\nthat for negatively curved models the apparent deviation is more significant.\nThe manifestation of this apparent deviation from GR due to the assumption of\nspatial flatness above leads one to conclude that, when using future\nhigh-precision data to perform these tests, spatial curvature must be included\nin the parameter analysis along with the other core cosmological parameters and\nthe MG parameters. \n\n"}

Avoiding biases in cosmological parameters due to\nthe resulting inevitable contamination from non-Ia supernovae can be achieved\nwith the BEAMS formalism, allowing for fully photometric supernova cosmology\nstudies. Here we extend BEAMS to deal with the case in which the supernovae are\ncorrelated by systematic uncertainties. The analytical form of the full BEAMS\nposterior requires evaluating 2^N terms, where N is the number of supernova\ncandidates. This `exponential catastrophe' is computationally unfeasible even\nfor N of order 100. We circumvent the exponential catastrophe by marginalising\nnumerically instead of analytically over the possible supernova types: we\naugment the cosmological parameters with nuisance parameters describing the\ncovariance matrix and the types of all the supernovae, \\tau_i, that we include\nin our MCMC analysis. We show that this method deals well even with large,\nunknown systematic uncertainties without a major increase in computational\ntime, whereas ignoring the correlations can lead to significant biases and\nincorrect credible contours. We then compare the numerical marginalisation\ntechnique with a perturbative expansion of the posterior based on the insight\nthat future surveys will have exquisite light curves and hence the probability\nthat a given candidate is a Type Ia will be close to unity or zero, for most\nobjects. Although this perturbative approach changes computation of the\nposterior from a 2^N problem into an N^2 or N^3 one, we show that it leads to\nbiases in general through a small number of misclassifications, implying that\nnumerical marginalisation is superior. \n\n"}

By comparing with a large range of population\nsynthesis models, we derive robust constraints on the radial trends in age and\nmetallicity. Metallicity is unambiguously found to decrease outwards, with a\nmeasurable steepening of the slope in the outer regions (Re<R<8Re). The\ngradients in stellar age are found to be more sensitive to the models used, but\nin general, the outer regions of ETGs feature older populations compared to the\ncores. This trend is strongest for the most massive galaxies in our sample\n(M*>10^11MSun). Furthermore, when segregating with respect to large scale\nenvironment, the age gradient is more significant in ETGs residing in higher\ndensity regions. These results shed light on the processes leading from the\nformation of the central core to the growth of the stellar envelope of massive\ngalaxies. The fact that the populations in the outer regions are older and more\nmetal-poor than in the core suggests a process whereby the envelope of massive\ngalaxies is made up of accreted small satellites (i.e. minor mergers) whose\nstars were born during the first stages of galaxy formation. \n\n"}

Interstellar gas converts\nfrom atomic to molecular only in regions that are well shielded from\ninterstellar ultraviolet (UV) photons, and since UV photons are also the\ndominant source of interstellar heating, only in these shielded regions does\nthe gas become cold enough to be subject to Jeans instability. However, while\nthe equilibrium temperature and chemical state of interstellar gas are\nwell-correlated, the time scale required to reach chemical equilibrium is much\nlonger than that required to reach thermal equilibrium, and both timescales are\nmetallicity-dependent.

Our approach relies on two basic assumptions: 1) galaxies'\naverage paths through time in stellar mass vs. star formation rate space are\nrepresented by a family of smooth functions that are determined by the\ngalaxies' final stellar mass, and 2) galaxies grow and become enriched with\nheavy elements such that they always evolve along the mass--metallicity--star\nformation rate relation. By integrating over these paths, we can track the\nchemical evolution of stars in galaxies in a model independent way, without the\nneed for explicit assumptions about gas inflow, outflow, or star formation\nefficiency. Using this approach, we present predictions of stellar metallicity\n(i.e., O/H) distribution functions for present day star-forming galaxies of\ndifferent stellar masses and the evolution of the alpha-element stellar\nmetallicity-mass relation since z~1. The metallicity distribution functions are\nfairly well described as Gaussians, truncated at high metallicity, with\npower-law tails to low metallicity.

An accurate theoretical modelling of their effect during\nthe non-linear regime of structure formation is required in order to properly\nanalyse current and upcoming high-precision large-scale structure data, and\nconstrain the neutrino mass. Taking advantage of the fact that massive\nneutrinos remain linearly clustered up to late times, this paper treats the\nlinear growth of neutrino overdensities in a non-linear CDM background. The\nevolution of the CDM component is obtained via N-body computations. The smooth\nneutrino component is evaluated from that background by solving the Boltzmann\nequation linearised with respect to the neutrino overdensity. CDM and neutrinos\nare simultaneously evolved in time, consistently accounting for their mutual\ngravitational influence. This method avoids the issue of shot-noise inherent to\nparticle-based neutrino simulations, and, in contrast with standard\nFourier-space methods, properly accounts for the non-linear potential wells in\nwhich the neutrinos evolve. Inside the most massive late-time clusters, where\nthe escape velocity is larger than the neutrino thermal velocity, neutrinos can\nclump non-linearly, causing the method to formally break down.

From the observed\nrotational velocity profile and the assumption of spherical symmetry, the\nGalactic mass density is modeled in a form close to that of an isothermal\nsphere. If the HCCs constitute a certain fraction of it, their angular size\ndistribution has a specified shape. A fit to the data deduced from the SMC/LMC\nmaps supports this and yields for their radius 2.5 pc, with a small change when\nallowing for a spread in HCC radii.

Here we employ ray-tracing N-body simulations in which we manually\nsteepen the density profile of each dark matter halo, mimicking the cooling and\nconcentration of baryons into dark matter potential wells.

We then study the impact of the halo concentration increase on the\npeak counts, and find the following. (i) Low peaks (with convergence 0.02 <\nkappa_peak < 0.08), remain nearly unaffected. These peaks are created by a\nconstellation of several halos with low masses (10^12-10^13 M_sun) and large\nangular offsets from the peak center (> 0.5 R_vir); as a result, they are\ninsensitive to the central halo density profiles.

However, when the baryon effects are neglected in\ncosmological parameter estimation, then the high peaks lead to a modest bias,\ncomparable to that from the power spectrum on relatively large-scales (l<2000),\nand much smaller than the bias from the power spectrum on smaller scales\n(l>2,000). (iii) In the 3D parameter space (sigma_8, Omega_m, w), the biases\nfrom the high peaks and the power spectra are in different directions.

In this case we confront two emissivity evolutions for the\nsources in order to reach the reionization at z ~ 6. As an alternative we built\na semi-analytical model where the dark matter halos extracted from the density\nfields are assumed as ionizing sources.

We consider two\ndifferent galaxy surveys: a spectroscopic redshift survey and a cosmic shear\nsurvey. We make use of the Monte Carlo Markov Chains (MCMC) technique and\nassume two sets of theoretical errors. The first error is meant to account for\nuncertainties in the modelling of the effect of neutrinos on the non-linear\ngalaxy power spectrum and we assume this error to be fully correlated in\nFourier space. The second error is meant to parametrize the overall residual\nuncertainties in modelling the non-linear galaxy power spectrum at small\nscales, and is conservatively assumed to be uncorrelated and to increase with\nthe ratio of a given scale to the scale of non-linearity. It hence increases\nwith wavenumber and decreases with redshift. With these two assumptions for the\nerrors and assuming further conservatively that the uncorrelated error rises\nabove 2% at k = 0.4 h/Mpc and z = 0.5, we find that a future Euclid-like cosmic\nshear/galaxy survey achieves a 1-sigma error on Mnu close to 32 meV/25 meV,\nsufficient for detecting the total neutrino mass with good significance.

We find that if the sub-grid feedback from star formation is implemented\nkinetically, the feedback is only efficient if the initial wind velocity\nexceeds a critical value. This critical velocity increases with galaxy mass and\nalso if metal-line cooling is included. This suggests that radiative losses\nquench the winds if their initial velocity is too low. If the feedback is\nefficient, then the star formation rate is inversely proportional to the amount\nof energy injected per unit stellar mass formed (which is proportional to the\ninitial mass loading for a fixed wind velocity). This can be understood if the\nstar formation is self-regulating, i.e. if the star formation rate (and thus\nthe gas fraction) increase until the outflow rate balances the inflow rate.\nFeedback from AGN is efficient at high masses, while increasing the initial\nwind velocity with gas pressure or halo mass allows one to generate galaxy-wide\noutflows at all masses. Matching the observed galaxy mass function requires\nefficient feedback. In particular, the predicted faint-end slope is too steep\nunless we resort to highly mass loaded winds for low-mass objects. Such\nefficient feedback from low-mass galaxies (M_* << 10^10 Msun) also reduces the\ndiscrepancy with the observed specific star formation rates, which are higher\nthan predicted unless the feedback transitions from highly efficient to\ninefficient just below the observed stellar mass range. \n\n"}

This offset is in agreement with previous results on morphological\nquenching: gas discs are more stable against star formation when embedded in\nearly-type galaxies due to the lower disc self-gravity and increased shear. As\na result, these gas discs do not fragment into dense clumps and do not reach as\nhigh densities as in the spiral galaxies.

For the LCDM+m_nu model the 2 sigma\nupper limit on total neutrino mass shifts from M_nu < 0.35 eV using cluster\ndata alone to M_nu < 0.031 eV when combined with CMB data. When a non-standard\nmodel with N_eff number of neutrino species is considered, we estimate\nN_eff<3.14 (95% CL), while the bounds on neutrino mass are relaxed to M_nu <\n0.040 eV. This accuracy would be sufficient for a 2 sigma detection of neutrino\nmass even in the minimal normal hierarchy scenario. We also consider scenarios\nwith a constant dark energy equation of state and a non-vanishing curvature.\nWhen these models are considered the error on M_nu is only slightly affected,\nwhile there is a larger impact of the order of ~ 15 % and ~ 20% respectively on\nthe 2 sigma error bar of N_eff with respect to the standard case. We also treat\nthe LCDM+m_nu+N_eff case with free nuisance parameters, which parameterize the\nuncertainties on the cluster mass determination. In this case, the upper bounds\non M_nu are relaxed by a factor larger than two, M_nu < 0.083 eV (95% CL),\nhence compromising the possibility of detecting the total neutrino mass with\ngood significance. We thus confirm the potential that a large optical/near-IR\ncluster survey, like that to be carried out by Euclid, could have in\nconstraining neutrino properties [abridged]. \n\n"}

While the\nspectrum, intensity, and angular distribution of this signal is in good\nagreement with predictions from annihilating dark matter, it has also been\nsuggested that a population of unresolved millisecond pulsars could be\nresponsible for this excess GeV emission from the Inner Galaxy. In this paper,\nwe consider this later possibility in detail.

We use the relation between mass, M, and velocity\ndispersion, sigma, as a test case, and show that the deviation from the M-sigma\nrelation of cluster-sized halos caused by pseudo-evolution is smaller than 10%\nfor a wide range of mass definitions. The reason for this small impact is a\ntight relation between the velocity dispersion and mass profiles, sigma(<r) =\nconst * (GM(<r) / r)^1/2, which holds across a wide range of radii. We show\nthat such a relation is generically expected for a variety of density profiles,\nas long as halos are in approximate Jeans equilibrium. Thus, as the outer\n\"virial\" radius used to define the halo mass, R, increases due to\npseudo-evolution, halos approximately preserve their M-sigma relation.

Recent studies have reported relatively weak\ncorrelations between observed AGN luminosities and the properties of AGN hosts,\nwhich has been interpreted to imply that there is no direct connection between\nAGN activity and star formation. However, AGNs may be expected to vary\nsignificantly on a wide range of timescales (from hours to Myr) that are far\nshorter than the typical timescale for star formation (>~100 Myr).

At such small radii, stars dominate the\nlensing mass, so that lensing provides a direct probe of the stellar\nmass-to-light ratio, with only small corrections needed for dark matter. The\nredshift of the galaxy lensed by ESO325-G004 was unknown until now, so the\nlensing mass was not securely determined. Using X-SHOOTER, we measure a secure\nsource redshift of z_src=2.141. Combined with the lensing configuration, this\nyields a total mass inside the Einstein radius of (1.50+/-0.06) 10^11 M_sun. We\nestimate the range of possible contribution of dark matter to the lensing mass,\nusing statistics from cosmological N-body simulations. Subtracting this\ncomponent yields a stellar M/L ratio for the lens of 3.14^+0.24_-0.42 (M/L)_sun\n(in F814W band). Using VIMOS, we have also obtained very high-S/N spectroscopy\nfor the lens galaxy.

A possible driver of this low\nefficiency is the radiation pressure exerted by ionizing photons from massive\nstars. The effect of radiation pressure in cosmological, zoom-in galaxy\nformation simulations is modeled as a non-thermal pressure that acts only in\ndense and optically thick star-forming regions. We also include photoionization\nand photoheating by massive stars. The full photoionization of hydrogen reduces\nthe radiative cooling in the $10^{4-4.5}$ K regime. The main effect of\nradiation pressure is to regulate and limit the high values of gas density and\nthe amount of gas available for star formation.

Intergalactic absorption along this\nsightline shows that the helium Gunn-Peterson trough is largely black in the\nrange $2.87 < z < 3.20$, apart from ionization due to local sources, indicating\nthat helium reionization has not completed at these redshifts. However, we\ntentatively report a detection of nonzero flux in the high-redshift trough when\nlooking at low-density regions, but zero flux in higher-density regions. This\nconstrains the He II fraction to be a few percent, suggesting helium\nreionization has progressed substantially by $z \\sim 3.1$. The Gunn-Peterson\ntrough recovers to a He II Ly$\\alpha$ forest at $z < 2.87$.

Recent observational\nworks suggest that such size evolution could reflect the similar evolution of\nthe host dark matter halo density as a function of the time of galaxy\nquenching. We explore this hypothesis by studying the distribution of halo\ncentral velocity dispersion ($\\sigma_0$) and half-mass radius ($r_{\\rm h}$) as\nfunctions of halo mass $M$ and redshift $z$, in a cosmological $\\Lambda$-CDM\n$N$-body simulation.

The answer is that such an embedding is very difficult and rare but not\nimpossible. Indeed we were able to find two examples of integrable models\nembedded in Supergravity in this way. Both examples are fitted into N=1\nSupergravity by means of a very specific and interesting choice of the\nsuperpotential W(z). The question whether there are examples of such an\nembedding in extended Gauged Supergravity remains open. In the present paper,\nrelying on the embedding tensor formalism we classified all gaugings of the N=2\nSTU model, confirming, in the absence on hypermultiplets, the uniqueness of the\nstable de Sitter vacuum found several years ago by Fre, Trigiante and Van\nProeyen and excluding the embedding of any integrable cosmological model.

The existing tension between Planck determination of these\nparameters in the frame of the base LambdaCDM model and their direct\nmeasurements generated lively discussions and several interpretations. In this\npaper we quantify this tension by exploring several extensions of the base\nLambdaCDM model that include the leptonic asymmetry. We set bounds on the\nradiation content of the Universe and neutrino properties by using the latest\ncosmological measurements, imposing also self-consistent BBN constraints on the\nprimordial helium abundance. For all cosmological asymmetric models we find the\npreference of cosmological data for smaller values of active and sterile\nneutrino masses. This increases the tension between cosmological and short\nbaseline neutrino oscillation data that favor a sterile neutrino with the mass\nof around 1 eV. For the case of degenerate massive neutrinos, we find that the\ndiscrepancies with direct determinations of the Hubble constant, the present\ncluster abundances and the age of the Universe are alleviated at ~ 1.3 sigma\nfor all leptonic asymmetric models.

The simulations span volumes ranging from (25 Mpc/h)^3 to (100\nMpc/h)^3, and are made using either 3 X 192^3~21 millions or 3 X 768^3~1.4\nbillion particles. The resolution of the various runs can be further enhanced,\nso that we can reach the equivalent of 3 X 3072^3~87 billion particles in a\n(100 Mpc/h)^3 box size. The chosen cosmological parameters are compatible with\nthe latest Planck (2013) results, although we also explore the effect of slight\nvariations in the main cosmological and astrophysical parameters. We adopt a\nparticle-type implementation of massive neutrinos, and consider three\ndegenerate species having masses M_nu =0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.8 eV,\nrespectively. We improve on previous studies in several ways, in particular\nwith updated routines for IGM radiative cooling and heating processes, and\ninitial conditions based on 2LPT rather than the Zeldovich approximation. \n\n"}

MBII is the highest resolution simulation of this size which\nincludes a self-consistent model for star formation, black hole accretion and\nassociated feedback. We provide a simulation browser web application which\nenables interactive search and tagging of halos, subhalos and their properties\nand publicly release our galaxy catalogs. Our analysis of the halo mass\nfunction (MF) in MBII reveals that baryons have strong effects, with changes in\nthe halo abundance of 20-35% below the knee of the MF (Mhalo < 10^13.2 Msun/h\nat z=0) when compared to fits based on dark matter only simulations. We provide\na fitting function for the halo MF out to redshift z=11 and discuss how the\nonset of non-universality in the MF limits the accuracy of our fit. We study\nthe halo occupation distribution and clustering of galaxies, in particular the\nevolution and scale dependence of stochasticity and bias finding reasonable\nagreement with observational data. The shape of the cosmic spectral energy\ndistribution predicted by MBII is consistent with observations, but lower in\namplitude. The Galaxy Stellar Mass Function (GSMF) function is broadly\nconsistent with observations at z>=2.

Although the\nhalo as a whole is not found to emit, the net transfer of angular momentum from\nthe disk to the halo is significantly reduced or completely eliminated. The\nparadigm shift implies that the accepted view that disks serve as sources of\nangular momentum and halos serve as sinks, must be revised.

CSI\nuses a flux-limited sample of galaxies in Spitzer IRAC 3.6micron imaging of\nSWIRE fields to efficiently trace the stellar mass of average galaxies to\nz~1.5. This paper provides an overview of the survey selection, observations,\nand processing of the photometry and spectrophotometry.

Our unique methodology for analyzing low-dispersion\nspectra taken with multilayer prisms in IMACS, combined with panchromatic\nphotometry from the ultraviolet to the IR, has yielded high quality redshifts\nfor 43,347 galaxies in our first 5.3 sq. degs of the SWIRE XMM-LSS field. A new\napproach to assessing data quality is also described, and three different\napproaches are used to estimate our redshift errors, with robust agreement.\nOver the full range of 3.6micron fluxes of our selection, we find typical\nredshift uncertainties of sigma_z/(1+z) < 0.015. In comparisons with previously\npublished spectroscopic redshifts we find scatters of sigma_z/(1+z) = 0.011 for\ngalaxies at 0.7< z< 0.9, and sigma_z/(1+z) = 0.014 for galaxies at 0.9< z< 1.2.\nFor galaxies brighter and fainter than i=23 mag, we find sigma_z/(1+z) = 0.008\nand sigma_z/(1+z) = 0.022, respectively.

One of the most commonly used ways to remove the dust foreground\nis to extrapolate the polarized dust emission signal from frequencies where it\ndominates (e.g., ~ 350 GHz) to frequencies commonly targeted by cosmic\nmicrowave background experiments (e.g., ~150 GHz).

In many cases the pseudoscalar's\nbranching ratio into WIMPs is suppressed, making these states challenging to\ndetect at colliders through standard dark matter searches. Here, we study the\nprospects for observing these light mediator states at the LHC without\nexploiting missing energy techniques. While existing searches effectively probe\npseudoscalars with masses between 5 - 14 GeV and above 90 GeV, the LHC reach\ncan be extended to cover much of the interesting parameter space in the\nintermediate 20 - 80 GeV mass range in which the mediator can have appreciable\nYukawa-like couplings to Standard Model fermions but would have escaped\ndetection by LEP and other experiments.

We perform an analysis\nof the backgrounds and trigger efficiencies, detailing the cuts that can be\nused to extract the signal. A significant portion of the otherwise\nunconstrained parameter space of these models can be conclusively tested at the\n13 TeV LHC with 100 fb$^{-1}$, and we encourage the ATLAS and CMS\ncollaborations to extend their existing searches to this mass range. \n\n"}

Contributions from density weighting are\nfound to be particularly important and lead to bias dependence of the IA\namplitude, even on large scales. This effect may be responsible for much of the\nluminosity dependence in IA observations. The increase in IA amplitude for more\nhighly biased galaxies reflects their locations in regions with large tidal\nfields. We also consider the impact of smoothing the tidal field on halo\nscales.

We present\nresults on the evolution of a misaligned gas disc in a cosmological simulation\nof a massive early-type galaxy from the Feedback In Realistic Environments\nproject. This galaxy experiences a merger which, together with a strong\ngalactic wind, removes most of the original gas disc. The galaxy subsequently\nreforms a gas disc through accretion of cold gas, but it is initially 120\ndegrees misaligned with the stellar rotation axis. This misalignment persists\nfor about 2 Gyr before the gas-star misalignment angle drops below 20 degrees.\nThe time it takes for the gaseous and stellar components to align is much\nlonger than previously thought, because the gas disc is accreting a significant\namount of mass for about 1.5 Gyr after the merger, during which the angular\nmomentum change induced by accreted gas dominates over that induced by stellar\ntorques. Once the gas accretion rate has decreased sufficiently, the gas disc\ndecouples from the surrounding halo gas and realigns with the stellar component\nin about 6 dynamical times. During the late evolution of the misaligned gas\ndisc, the centre aligns faster than the outskirts, resulting in a warped disc.\nWe discuss the observational consequences of the long survival of our\nmisaligned gas disc and how our results can be used to calibrate merger rate\nestimates from observed gas misalignments. \n\n"}

Due to the LIV effect, photons with different energy\nhave different velocities. This will lead to the delayed arrival of high energy\nphotons relative to the low energy ones. Based on the fact that the LIV-induced\ntime delay can't be longer than the duration of a GRB, we present the most\nconservative estimation of the quantum gravity energy scales from 20 short\nGRBs.

Abstract: A very general cosmological consideration suggests that, along with galactic\ndark matter halos, much smaller dark matter structures may exist. These\nstructures are usually called 'clumps', and their mass extends to $10^{-6}\nM_\\odot$ or even lower. The clumps should give the main contribution into the\nsignal of dark matter annihilation, provided that they have survived until the\npresent time. Recent observations favor a cored profile for low-mass\nastrophysical halos. We consider cored clumps and show that they are\nsignificantly less firm than the standard NFW ones. In contrast to the standard\nscenario, the cored clumps should have been completely destroyed inside $\\sim\n20$~{kpc} from the Milky Way center. The dwarf spheroidals should not contain\nany dark matter clumps. On the other hand, even under the most pessimistic\nassumption about the clump structure, the clumps should have survived in the\nMilky Way at a distance exceeding $50$~{kpc} from the center, as well as in\nlow-density cosmic structures.

In this work we analyse the\ndependance of the mass function on the way haloes are identified and establish\nif this can cause departures from universality. In order to explore this\ndependance, we use a set of different N-body cosmological simulations (Le\nSBARBINE simulations), with the latest cosmological parameters from the Planck\ncollaboration; this first suite of simulations is followed by a lower\nresolution set, carried out with different cosmological parameters.

In this case, no flat or falling rotation curve is possible for any\n(barotropic) equation of state with associated sound speed decreasing with\ndensity (a necessary condition if the fluid is to behave as pressureless matter\nat high density). The associated density profile is therefore also incompatible\nwith that inferred in the outer part of clusters.

With these points in mind, this\nwork presents a simple theoretical model for the linear covariance of\nanisotropic galaxy clustering observations with synthetic catalogues.\nConsidering the Legendre moments (`multipoles') of the two-point statistics and\nprojections into wide bins of the line-of-sight parameter (`clustering\nwedges'), we describe the modelling of the covariance for these anisotropic\nclustering measurements for galaxy samples with a trivial geometry in the case\nof a Gaussian approximation of the clustering likelihood. As main result of\nthis paper, we give the explicit formulae for Fourier and configuration space\ncovariance matrices. To validate our model, we create synthetic HOD galaxy\ncatalogues by populating the haloes of an ensemble of large-volume N-body\nsimulations. Using linear and non-linear input power spectra, we find very good\nagreement between the model predictions and the measurements on the synthetic\ncatalogues in the quasi-linear regime. \n\n"}

In astroparticle physics, this has so far not been\npossible, since most of the observables were calculated at Born level only, so\nthat the renormalization scheme and scale dependence could not be studied in a\nmeaningful way. In this paper, we present the first quantitative study of the\ntheoretical uncertainty of the neutralino dark matter relic density from scheme\nand scale variations. We first explain in detail how the renormalization scale\nenters the tree-level calculations through coupling constants, masses and\nmixing angles. We then demonstrate a reduction of the renormalization scale\ndependence through one-loop SUSY-QCD corrections in many different dark matter\nannihilation channels and enhanced perturbative stability of a mixed\non-shell/$\\bar{\\rm DR}$ renormalization scheme over a pure $\\bar{\\rm DR}$\nscheme in the top-quark sector.

The\nMDAR holds for most radii probed by disk kinematic tracers, regardless of\ngalaxy mass or surface brightness. The relation has two characteristic\naccelerations; $a_0$, above which all galaxies are baryon-dominated; and\n$a_{\\rm min}$, an effective minimum aceleration probed by kinematic tracers in\nisolated galaxies. We use a simple model to show that these trends arise\nnaturally in $\\Lambda$CDM. This is because: (i) disk galaxies in $\\Lambda$CDM\nform at the centre of dark matter haloes spanning a relatively narrow range of\nvirial mass; (ii) cold dark matter halo acceleration profiles are self-similar\nand have a broad maximum at the centre, reaching values bracketed precisely by\n$a_{\\rm min}$ and $a_0$ in that mass range; and (iii) halo mass and galaxy size\nscale relatively tightly with the baryonic mass of a galaxy in any successful\n$\\Lambda$CDM galaxy formation model.

Combining these\nobservations with those from the literature, we construct broad-band radio\nspectra of all 30 z>4.5 sources that have been observed with VLBI.

Using data\nfrom SDSS, we explore the evidence for such a feature in the density profiles\nof galaxy clusters and investigate the connection between this feature and a\npossible phase space boundary.

We find evidence of an abrupt change in the galaxy colors that\ncoincides with the location of the steepening of the density profile.

The\n  catalogue of groups and potentially merging systems Abstract: Galaxy groups and clusters are the main tools used to test cosmological\nmodels and to study the environmental effect of galaxy formation. This work\nprovides a catalogue of galaxy groups and clusters, as well as potentially\nmerging systems based on the SDSS main galaxy survey. We identified galaxy\ngroups and clusters using the modified friends-of-friends (FoF) group finder\ndesigned specifically for flux-limited galaxy surveys. The FoF group membership\nis refined by multimodality analysis to find subgroups and by using the group\nvirial radius and escape velocity to expose unbound galaxies. We look for\nmerging systems by comparing distances between group centres with group radii.\n  The analysis results in a catalogue of 88662 galaxy groups with at least two\nmembers. Among them are 6873 systems with at least six members which we\nconsider to be more reliable groups. We find 498 group mergers with up to six\ngroups. We performed a brief comparison with some known clusters in the nearby\nUniverse, including the Coma cluster and Abell 1750. The Coma cluster in our\ncatalogue is a merging system with six distinguishable subcomponents. In the\ncase of Abell 1750 we find a clear sign of filamentary infall toward this\ncluster.

Abstract: Radio relics in galaxy clusters are believed to trace merger shock fronts. If\ncosmological structure formation determines the luminosity, size and shape\ndistributions of radio relics then merger shocks need to be lighted up in a\nhomogeneous way. We investigate if a mock relic sample, obtained from zoomed\ngalaxy cluster simulations, is able to match the properties of relics measured\nin the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS). We compile a list of all radio relics known\nto date and homogeneously measure their parameters in all NVSS images and apply\nthe same procedure to relics in our simulations. Number counts in the mock\nrelic sample increase more steeply towards lower relic flux densities,\nsuggesting an incompleteness of NVSS in this regime. Overall, we find that NVSS\nand mock samples show similar properties. However, large simulated relics tend\nto be somewhat smaller and closer to the cluster centre than observed ones.\nBesides this, the mock sample reproduces very well-known correlations for radio\nrelics, in particular those relating the radio luminosity with the largest\nlinear size and the X-ray luminosity. We show that these correlations are\nlargely governed by the sensitivity of the NVSS observations. Mock relics show\na similar orientation with respect to the direction to the cluster centre as\nthe NVSS sample. Moreover, we find that their maximum radio luminosity roughly\ncorrelates with cluster mass, although displaying a large scatter. The overall\ngood agreement between NVSS and the mock sample suggests that properties of\nradio relics are indeed governed by merger shock fronts, emitting in a\nhomogeneous fashion. Our study demonstrates that the combination of mock\nobservations and data from upcoming radio surveys will allow to shed light on\nboth the origin of radio relics and the nature of the intracluster medium. \n\n"}

First, the Compton scattering of CMB\nphotons off the free electrons lead to a drag force on the baryon fluid.

Our analytic estimates indicate that the tidal field of halos and\ninteractions with other PBHs, as well as dynamical friction by unbound standard\nDM particles, do not do significant work on nor torque PBH binaries. We\nestimate the torque due to baryon accretion to be much weaker than previous\ncalculations, albeit possibly large enough to significantly affect the\neccentricity of typical PBH binaries.

Examining the\nfraction of CCs and NCCs defined as relaxed we find no evidence that CCs are\nmore relaxed, suggesting that mergers are not solely responsible for disrupting\nCCs. A comparison of the median thermodynamic profiles defined by different CC\ncriteria shows that the extent to which they evolve in the cluster core is\ndependent on the CC criteria.

The power-law model is the most\nflexible as it can break spherical symmetry, and best fits the data. Thus, we\nrecommend the power-law model as a replacement, although it still lacks the\nflexibility to fully encapsulate all possible shapes of the Milky Way halo.

The interaction between CRs and electromagnetic fields\nof Alfv\\'enic turbulence provides the main source of CR scattering, and causes\nCRs to stream along the magnetic field with the Alfv\\'en velocity if resonant\nwaves are sufficiently energetic. However, numerical simulations struggle to\ncapture this effect with current transport formalisms and adopt regularization\nschemes to ensure numerical stability. We extent the theory by deriving an\nequation for the CR momentum density along the mean magnetic field and include\na transport equation for the Alfv\\'en-wave energy. We account for energy\nexchange of CRs and Alfv\\'en waves via the gyroresonant instability and include\nother wave damping mechanisms. Using numerical simulations we demonstrate that\nour new theory enables stable, self-regulated CR transport. The theory is\ncoupled to magneto-hydrodynamics, conserves the total energy and momentum, and\ncorrectly recovers previous macroscopic CR transport formalisms in the\nsteady-state flux limit. Because it is free of tunable parameters, it holds the\npromise to provide predictable simulations of CR feedback in galaxy formation. \n\n"}

If information could be\nstored in each Planck-volume independently, this effect would give rise to a\nconstant acceleration $10^{120}$ times larger than that observed, reproducing\nthe usual cosmological constant problem.

We find that the nonlinear density of filaments in the epoch of\nformation is almost mass independent and is in order of $\\sim 30$. By\nintroducing {\\it{filament's extended condition}} we find a fitting function for\nlength-mass relation. For the statistics of filaments, we propose a novel\nframework named excursion set of saddle points. In this approach, we count the\nsaddle points of the density field Hessian matrix, and relate it to the count\nof filaments. In addition, we addressed the filament in filament problem with\nup-crossing approximation. \n\n"}

The\nmissing baryons are believed to reside in large-scale filaments in the form of\nwarm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM).

The main experimental effects and systematic uncertainties have been\ninvestigated in side experiments and possible error sources have been\neliminated. Extensive data taking took place in the years 1997 to 2001. A\nresidual analysis of the data sets yields for the square of the electron\nantineutrino mass the final result of $m^2(\\nu_e)=(-0.6 \\pm 2.2_{\\rm{stat}} \\pm\n2.1_{\\rm{syst}})$ eV$^2$/c$^4$. We derive an upper limit of $m(\\nu_e)\\leq 2.3$\neV/c$^2$ at 95% confidence level for the mass itself. \n\n"}
