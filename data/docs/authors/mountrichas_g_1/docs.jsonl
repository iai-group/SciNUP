Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on\nthe role that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in\nglobular clusters, e.g., influencing the distribution of horizontal branch\nstars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of some globular clusters, and in\nforming low mass white dwarfs. \n\n"}

We also present estimates of the fraction of cores in the\n\"prestellar\", \"stellar'', and \"failed\" (those cores that redisperse back into\nthe environment) stages as a function of n_thr. The number ratios are measured\nindirectly in the simulations due to their resolution limitations. Our approach\ncontains one free parameter, the lifetime of a protostellar object t_yso (Class\n0 + Class I stages), which is outside the realm of the simulations. Assuming a\nvalue t_yso = 0.46 Myr, we obtain number ratios of starless to stellar cores\nranging from 4-5 at n_thr = 1.5 x 10^4 cm^-3 to 1 at n_thr = 1.2 x 10^5 cm^-3,\nagain in good agreement with observational determinations.

These so-called\nultra compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) constitute a transition between classical\nstar clusters and elliptical galaxies in terms of radii, relaxation times and\nV-band mass-to-light (M/L_V) ratios. Using new data, we find that the mass\ninterval from 10^6 to 10^7 M_sun is of special interest, because within this\nrange typical half-light radii and dynamical mass-to-light ratios begin to\nincrease compared to globular clusters, the highest stellar densities are\nreached and typical median two-body relaxation times surpass a Hubble time.

This image provides the highest spatial resolution view of such an object\nto date (16 pc), more than three times better than previous VLBI observations\nof similar objects.

The presence of pc-scale\ncomponents in the hot spot, identifying regions containing strong shocks in the\nfluid flow, leads us to explore the suggestion that they represent sites of\nsynchrotron X-ray production, contributing to the integrated X-ray flux of the\nhot spot, along with X-rays from synchrotron self-Compton scattering.

In this simulation, the velocity dispersions at\nall scales are caused primarily by infall motions rather than by random\nturbulence. We study the properties (density, total gas+stars mass, stellar\nmass, velocity dispersion, and star formation rate) of the cloud hosting the\nfirst local, isolated \"star formation\" event in the simulation and compare them\nwith those of the cloud formed by a later central, global collapse event. We\nsuggest that the small-scale, isolated collapse may be representative of low-\nto intermediate-mass star-forming regions, while the large-scale, massive one\nmay be representative of massive star forming regions. We also find that the\nstatistical distributions of physical properties of the dense cores in the\nregion of massive collapse compare very well with those from a recent survey of\nthe massive star forming region in the Cygnus X molecular cloud. The star\nformation efficiency per free-fall time (SFE_ff) of the high-mass SF clump is\nlow, ~0.04. This occurs because the clump is accreting mass at a high rate, not\nbecause its specific SFR (SSFR) is low. This implies that a low value of the\nSFE_ff does not necessarily imply a low SSFR, but may rather indicate a large\ngas accretion rate. We suggest that a globally low SSFR at the GMC level can be\nattained even if local star forming sites have much larger values of the SSFR\nif star formation is a spatially intermittent process, so that most of the mass\nin a GMC is not participating of the SF process at any given time. \n\n"}

In this work we investigate the role of the suppression\nof diffusivity in a flux-transport solar dynamo model that also includes a\nnon-linear alpha-quenching term. Our results indicate that, although for\nalpha-quenching the dependence of the magnetic field amplification with the\nquenching factor is nearly linear, the magnetic field response to eta-quenching\nis non-linear and spatially non-uniform. We have found that the magnetic field\ncan be locally amplified in this case, forming long-lived structures whose\nmaximum amplitude can be up to ~2.5 times larger at the tachocline and up to ~2\ntimes larger at the center of the convection zone than in models without\nquenching. However, this amplification leads to unobservable effects and to a\nworse distribution of the magnetic field in the butterfly diagram. Since the\ndynamo cycle period increases when the efficiency of the quenching increases,\nwe have also explored whether the eta-quenching can cause a diffusion-dominated\nmodel to drift into an advection-dominated regime.

Such a large instantaneous inflow\ncannot have persisted over a Hubble time. The central constant-entropy\ntemperature peak recently observed in the innermost 150 parsecs is explained by\ncompressive heating as gas flows toward the central massive black hole. Since\nthe cooling time of this gas is only a few million years, NGC 4649 provides the\nmost acutely concentrated known example of the cooling flow problem in which\nthe time-integrated apparent mass that has flowed into the galactic core\nexceeds the total mass observed there.

Void radii below 300 Mpc are\nconsidered, which are supported by current redshift surveys and limited by the\nrecently observed imprint such voids leave on CMB. The averaging over all\ndirections, performed by numerical ray tracing, is non-perturbative and\nincludes the supernovas inside the voids. Voids aligning along a certain\ndirection produce a cumulative gravitational lensing correction that increases\nwith their number. Such corrections are destroyed by the averaging over all\ndirections, even in non-randomized simple cubic void lattices. At low\nredshifts, the average correction is not zero but decays with the peculiar\nvelocities and redshift. Its upper bound is provided by the maximal average\ncorrection which assumes no random cancelations between different voids.

Following\nthe detections of Cen A and Per A, this makes M87 the third radio galaxy seen\nwith the LAT. The faint point-like gamma-ray source has a >100 MeV flux of 2.45\n(+/- 0.63) x 10^-8 ph cm^-2 s^-1 (photon index = 2.26 +/- 0.13) with no\nsignificant variability detected within the LAT observation. This flux is\ncomparable with the previous EGRET upper limit (< 2.18 x 10^-8 ph cm^-2 s^-1, 2\nsigma), thus there is no evidence for a significant MeV/GeV flare on decade\ntimescales. Contemporaneous Chandra and VLBA data indicate low activity in the\nunresolved X-ray and radio core relative to previous observations, suggesting\nM87 is in a quiescent overall level over the first year of Fermi-LAT\nobservations.

In\nthis work we explore the possibility of quantization without subsidiary\nconditions. This implies that the theory would contain a third physical state.\nThe presence of such a new (temporal) electromagnetic mode on cosmological\nscales is shown to generate an effective cosmological constant which can\naccount for the accelerated expansion of the universe. This new polarization\nstate is completely decoupled from charged matter, but can be excited\ngravitationally.

Three major\nmechanisms are believed to dominate the radiation process: emission from\nneutral hydrogen surrounding the ionized bubbles of first galaxies and/or\nquasars, emission from neutral hydrogen inside minihalos, and absorption of\ndiffuse neutral hydrogen against the cosmic microwave background. In the\npresent work, by simply combining the existing analytic models for the three\nmechanisms, we investigate the contribution of cross-correlation between these\nthree components to the total 21cm angular power spectrum, in the sense that\nneutral hydrogen associated with different radiation processes traces the\nlarge-scale structures of underlying density perturbations.

Abstract: The Galactic disc is opaque to radio waves from extragalactic sources with\nfrequencies nu less than ~3 MHz. However, radio waves with kHz, Hz, and even\nlower frequencies may propagate through the intergalactic medium (IGM). I argue\nthat the presence of these waves can be inferred by using the Universe as our\ndetector. I discuss possible sub-MHz sources and set new non-trivial upper\nlimits on the energy density of sub-MHz radio waves in galaxy clusters and the\naverage cosmic background. Limits based on five effects are considered: (1)\nchanges in the expansion of the Universe from the radiation energy density (2)\nheating of the IGM by free-free absorption; (3) radiation pressure squeezing of\nIGM clouds by external radio waves; (4) synchrotron heating of electrons in\nclusters; and (5) Inverse Compton upscattering of sub-MHz radio photons. Any\nsub-MHz background must have an energy density much smaller than the CMB at\nfrequencies below 1 MHz. The free-free absorption bounds from the Lyman-alpha\nforest are potentially the strongest, but are highly dependent on the\nproperties of sub-MHz radio scattering in the IGM. I estimate an upper limit of\n6 * 10^4 L_sun Mpc^-3 for the emissivity within Lyman-alpha forest clouds in\nthe frequency range 5 - 200 Hz. The sub-MHz energy density in the Coma cluster\nis constrained to be less than ~10^-15 erg cm^-3. At present, none of the\nlimits is strong enough to rule out a maximal T_b = 10^12 K sub-MHz synchrotron\nbackground, but other sources may be constrained with a better knowledge of\nsub-MHz radio propagation in the IGM. \n\n"}

We use realistic radiative\n3D MHD simulations to investigate the interaction between magnetic field and\nturbulent convection. In the simulations, a weak vertical uniform magnetic\nfield is imposed in a region of fully developed granular convection; and the\ntotal magnetic flux through the top and bottom boundaries is kept constant. The\nsimulation results reveal a process of spontaneous formation of stable magnetic\nstructures, which may be a key to understanding of the magnetic\nself-organization on the Sun and formation of pores and sunspots. This process\nconsists of two basic steps: 1) formation of small-scale filamentary magnetic\nstructures associated with concentrations of vorticity and whirlpool-type\nmotions, and 2) merging of these structures due to the vortex attraction,\ncaused by converging downdrafts around magnetic concentration below the\nsurface. In the resulting large-scale structure maintained by the converging\nplasma motions, the magnetic field strength reaches ~1.5 kG at the surface and\n~6 kG in the interior; and the surface structure resembles solar pores.

We have used PACS and SPIRE to measure the far IR\nflux densities of the entire SNR and of a bright region on the eastern edge of\nthe SNR where the SNR shock is encountering the molecular cloud. Using these\nfluxes supplemented with archival data at shorter wavelengths, we estimate the\ndust mass associated with N49 to be about 10 Msun. The bulk of the dust in our\nsimple two-component model has a temperature of 20-30 K, similar to that of\nnearby molecular clouds.

The Y-mass relation can\nbe biased if non-equipartition effects are not properly taken into account.\nUsing a set of hydrodynamical simulations, we have calculated three potential\nsystematic biases in the Y-mass relations introduced by non-equipartition\neffects during the cross-calibration or self-calibration when using the galaxy\ncluster abundance technique to constraint cosmological parameters. We then use\na semi-analytic technique to estimate the non-equipartition effects on the\ndistribution functions of Y (Y functions) determined from the extended\nPress-Schechter theory.

With a\nfaithful parameterization of the beam shape, we can constrain certain detector\nproperties, such as the time constants of the detectors, to high precision.\nAlternatively, we decompose the beam using an orthogonal basis.

The diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) mechanism is usually\ninvoked to explain this acceleration, but the way in which electrons are\ninitially energized or 'injected' into this acceleration process starting from\nthermal energies is an unresolved problem. In this paper we study the initial\nacceleration of electrons in non-relativistic shocks from first principles,\nusing two- and three-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) plasma simulations. We\nsystematically explore the space of shock parameters (the Alfv\\'enic Mach\nnumber, M_A, the shock velocity, v_{sh}, the angle between the upstream\nmagnetic field and the shock normal, theta_{Bn}, and the ion to electron mass\nratio, m_i/m_e). We find that significant non-thermal acceleration occurs due\nto the growth of oblique whistler waves in the foot of quasi-perpendicular\nshocks. The obtained electron energy distributions show power law tails with\nspectral indices up to alpha ~ 3-4. The maximum energies of the accelerated\nparticles are consistent with the electron Larmor radii being comparable to\nthat of the ions, indicating potential injection into the subsequent DSA\nprocess.

Thus, if the whistler mechanism is the only robust\nelectron injection process at work in SNR shocks, then SNRs that display\nnon-thermal emission must have significantly amplified upstream magnetic\nfields.

We find that the\nmagnetic energy grows exponentially in a few eddy turnover times, and then,\nfollowing the decay of kinetic turbulence, decays with a temporal power-law\nexponent of -0.7. The magnetic-energy fraction can reach $epsilon_B \\sim$ 0.1\nbut depends on the initial magnetic field strength. We find that the magnetic\nenergy grows by at least two orders of magnitude compared to the magnetic\nenergy immediately behind the shock. This minimum degree of the amplification\ndoes not depend on the amplitude of the initial density fluctuations, while the\ngrowth timescale and the maximum magnetic energy depend on the degree of\ninhomogeneity in the density. The transition from Kolmogorov cascade to MHD\ncritical balance cascade occurs at $\\sim$ 1/10th the initial inhomogeneity\nscale, which limits the maximum synchrotron polarization to less than 2%. New\nresults include the avoidance of electron cooling with RMI turbulence, the\nturbulent photosphere model via RMI, and the shallow decay of the early\nafterglow from RMI. We also performed a simulation of freely decaying\nturbulence with relativistic velocity dispersion. We find that relativistic\nturbulence begins to decay much faster than one eddy-turnover time because of\nfast shock dissipation, which does not support the relativistic turbulence\nmodel by Narayan & Kumar. \n\n"}

An\nequation of state for equilibrated dark halos is derived from this entropy\nstationary equation, by which the dark halo density profiles with finite mass\ncan be obtained.

This constitutes a truly\nmicroscopic model of dynamical space-time, where Finsler geometries arise\nnaturally. The D-particle foam model involves point-like brane defects\n(D-particles), which provide the topologically non-trivial foamy structures of\nspace-time. The D-particles can capture and emit stringy matter and this leads\nto a recoil of D-particles. It is indicated how one effect of such a recoil of\nD-particles is a back-reaction on the space-time metric of Finsler type which\nis stochastic. We show that such a type of stochastic space-time foam can lead\nto acceptable cosmologies at late epochs of the Universe, due to the\nnon-trivial properties of the supersymmetric (BPS like) D-particle defects,\nwhich are such so as not to affect significantly the Hubble expansion. The\nrestrictions placed on the free parameters of the Finsler type metric are\nobtained from solving the Boltzmann equation in this background for relic\nabundances of a Lightest Supersymmetric Particle (LSP) dark matter candidate.\nIt is demonstrated that the D-foam acts as a source for particle production in\nthe Boltzmann equation, thereby leading to enhanced thermal LSP relic\nabundances relative to those in the Standard LambdaCDM Cosmology. For\nD-particle masses of order TeV, such effects may be relevant for dark matter\nsearches at colliders. The latter constraints complement those coming from high\nenergy gamma-ray astronomy on the induced vacuum refractive index that D-foam\nmodels entail. We also comment briefly on the production mechanisms of such\nTeV-mass stringy defects at colliders, which, in view of the current LHC\nexperimental searches, will impose further constraints on their couplings. \n\n"}

We find that the majority of this combined\nsample is likely heavily obscured, as evidenced by the 2-10 keV X-ray\nattenuation (normalized by intrinsic flux diagnostics) and the large Fe\nK$\\alpha$ equivalent widths (several hundred eV to over 1 keV). A wide range of\nthese obscuration diagnostics is present, showing a continuum of column\ndensities, rather than a clear segregation into Compton-thick and Compton-thin\nsub-populations.

The spectra have a peak in the range\n20-40 GHz and are detected at high significances of 17.1 sigma for Perseus and\n8.4 sigma for Rho Ophiuchi.

We show that turbulent\nbraking in the Prandtl-Karman model with universally accepted coefficients for\nterrestrial conditions and laboratory experiments and a ladder of interacting\ngravity waves in a stratified quasi-exponential atmosphere at standard\nRichardson numbers lead to a spin-up of the massive zone that extends to the\nocean made up of a plasma with degenerate electrons. Turbulent braking in the\nocean at the boundary with the outer solid crust reduces the rotation velocity\nto the solid-body rotation velocity of the star. This situation should lead to\nstrong heating of deep atmospheric layers and to the switch-off of the\nexplosive helium burning mechanism.

We find that the drop\nin the star formation rate follows a corresponding decline in the global\ncold-mode accretion rate density onto haloes, but with a delay of order the gas\nconsumption time scale in the interstellar medium. Here we define cold-mode\n(hot-mode) accretion as gas that is accreted and whose temperature has never\nexceeded (did exceed) 10^5.5 K. In contrast to cold-mode accretion, which peaks\nat z~3, the hot mode continues to increase to z~1 and remains roughly constant\nthereafter. By the present time, the hot mode strongly dominates the global\naccretion rate onto haloes. Star formation does not track hot-mode halo\naccretion because most of the hot halo gas never accretes onto galaxies. AGN\nfeedback plays a crucial role by preferentially preventing gas that entered\nhaloes in the hot mode from accreting onto their central galaxies.\nConsequently, in the absence of AGN feedback, gas accreted in the hot mode\nwould become the dominant source of fuel for star formation and the drop off in\nthe cosmic star formation rate would be much less steep. \n\n"}

Our final sample consists of 44 Seyfert\n1's, 29 Seyfert 1.5's, 78 Seyfert 2's, and 14 Narrow Line Seyfert 1's. We\nderived the average hard X-ray spectrum of each subsample in the 17-250keV\nenergy range. All classes of Seyfert galaxies show on average the same nuclear\ncontinuum, as foreseen by the zeroth order unified model, with a cut-off energy\nof Ec>200keV, and a photon index of Gamma ~1.8. Compton-thin Seyfert 2's show a\nreflection component stronger than Seyfert 1's and Seyfert 1.5's. Most of this\nreflection is due to mildly obscured (10^23 cm^-2 < NH < 10^24 cm^-2) Seyfert\n2's, which have a significantly stronger reflection component\n(R=2.2^{+4.5}_{-1.1}) than Seyfert 1's (R<=0.4), Seyfert 1.5's (R<= 0.4) and\nlightly obscured (NH < 10^23 cm^-2) Seyfert 2's (R<=0.5). This cannot be\nexplained easily by the unified model. The absorber/reflector in mildly\nobscured Seyfert 2's might cover a large fraction of the X-ray source, and have\nclumps of Compton-thick material. The large reflection found in the spectrum of\nmildly obscured Seyfert 2's reduces the amount of Compton-thick objects needed\nto explain the peak of the cosmic X-ray background.

The spectra of Seyfert\n2's with and without polarized broad lines do not show significant differences,\nthe only difference between the two samples being the higher hard X-ray and\nbolometric luminosity of Seyfert 2's with polarized broad lines.

We performed monitoring of 42 blazars in the optical and\nnear-infrared bands from 2008 to 2010 using TRISPEC attached to the \"Kanata\"\n1.5-m telescope. We found that 28 blazars exhibited \"bluer-when-brighter\"\ntrends in their whole or a part of time-series data sets. This corresponds to\n88% of objects that were observed for >10 days. Thus, our observation\nunambiguously confirmed that the \"bluer-when-brighter\" trend is common in the\nemission from blazar jets. This trend was apparently generated by a variation\ncomponent with a constant and relatively blue color and an underlying red\ncomponent. Prominent short-term flares on time scales of days--weeks tended to\nexhibit a spectral hysteresis; their rising phases were bluer than their decay\nphases around the flare maxima. In contrast to the strong flux--color\ncorrelation, the correlation of the flux and polarization degree was relatively\nweak; only 10 objects showed significant positive correlations. Rotations of\npolarization were detected only in three objects: PKS 1510-089, 3C 454.3, and\nPKS 1749+096, and possibly in S5 0716+714.

Our observation suggests the presence of\nseveral distinct emitting sources, which have different variation time-scales,\ncolors, and polarizations.

These simulations show that flattening by rotation is key to\nreproducing the observed characteristics of flat dwarf galaxies, proving\nparticularly efficient in erasing metallicity gradients. We propose a\n\"centrifugal barrier mechanism\" as an alternative to the previously suggested\n\"fountain mechanism\" for explaining the flat metallicity profiles of dIrrs and\nflat, rotating dEs. While only flattening the dark-matter halo has little\ninfluence, the addition of angular momentum slows down the infall of gas, so\nthat star formation (SF) and the ensuing feedback are less centrally\nconcentrated, occurring galaxy-wide. Additionally, this leads to more\ncontinuous SFHs by preventing large-scale oscillations in the SFR\n(\"breathing\"), and creates low density holes in the ISM, in agreement with\nobservations of dIrrs. Our general conclusion is that rotation has a\nsignificant influence on the evolution and appearance of dwarf galaxies, and we\nsuggest angular momentum as a second parameter (after galaxy mass as the\ndominant parameter) in dwarf galaxy evolution. Angular momentum differentiates\nbetween SF modes, making our fast rotating models qualitatively resemble dIrrs,\nwhich does not seem possible without rotation. \n\n"}

Over this redshift range the mean pair fraction is\nessentially constant (evolving as f_pair (1+z)^{-0.4 +/- 0.6}) with about\n6+/-1% of massive galaxies having a 1:4 or greater companion within 30h^-1 kpc.\nAssuming the timescale over which pairs merge is not a strong function of\nredshift, this implies a similarly constant merger rate (per unit time) out to\nz=2. Since about three times as much cosmic time passes at z<1 as between\nz=1-2, this implies that correspondingly more mergers occur in the low-redshift\nuniverse. When minor companions (1:10 mass ratio or greater) are included, the\npair fraction increases to ~20% and still does not evolve strongly with\nredshift. We also use a rest-frame color criterion to select pairs containing\nonly quiescent galaxies (major \"dry merger\" progenitors), and find them to be\nsimilarly rare and constant with 4-7% of massive quiescent galaxies exhibiting\na nearby companion.

The narrow band\ncatches both the emission line and the underlying continuum, and one needs to\nextract the pure emission line light curve.

In Ark120, H_beta contributes only 50%\nto the flux in the NB. The cross correlation of the B and NB light curves shows\ntwo distinct peaks of similar strength, one at lag zero from the autocorrelated\ncontinuum and one from the emission line at tau_cent = 47.5 +/- 3.4 days. We\nconstructed a synthetic H_beta light curve, by subtracting a scaled V light\ncurve, which traces the continuum, from the NB light curve. The cross\ncorrelation of this synthetic H_beta light curve with the B light curve shows\nonly one major peak at tau_cent = 48.0 +/- 3.3 days, while the peak from the\nautocorrelated continuum at lag zero is absent.

The derived periods of these two\ncompanions are close to a 2:1 mean-motion orbital resonance.

Results indicate an orbit-crossing architecture exhibiting\nshort-term dynamical instabilities leading to the escape of one of the proposed\ncompanions.

Such an emergent nature is most apparent in the structure of\ngravitational dynamics. It is, however, possible to go beyond the field\nequations and study the space itself as emergent in a well-defined manner in\n(and possibly only in) the context of cosmology. In the first part of this\nreview, I describe various pieces of evidence which show that gravitational\nfield equations are emergent. In the second part, I describe a novel way of\nstudying cosmology in which I interpret the expansion of the universe as\nequivalent to the emergence of space itself. In such an approach, the dynamics\nevolves towards a state of holographic equipartition, characterized by the\nequality of number of bulk and surface degrees of freedom in a region bounded\nby the Hubble radius. This principle correctly reproduces the standard\nevolution of a Friedmann universe. Further, (a) it demands the existence of an\nearly inflationary phase as well as late time acceleration for its successful\nimplementation and (b) allows us to link the value of late time cosmological\nconstant to the e-folding factor during inflation. \n\n"}

This type of accretion, which is\nadditional to the common cold accretion during disk instabilities and galaxy\nmergers, is tightly coupled to the AGN feedback in the model. The hot-halo mode\nbecomes prominent in DM haloes with masses greater than ~10^12.5 Msun, where\nAGN feedback typically operates, giving rise to a distinct class of moderate\nluminosity AGN that inhabit rich clusters and superclusters.

Recent studies have reported relatively weak\ncorrelations between observed AGN luminosities and the properties of AGN hosts,\nwhich has been interpreted to imply that there is no direct connection between\nAGN activity and star formation. However, AGNs may be expected to vary\nsignificantly on a wide range of timescales (from hours to Myr) that are far\nshorter than the typical timescale for star formation (>~100 Myr). This\nvariability can have important consequences for observed correlations. We\npresent a simple model in which all star-forming galaxies host an AGN when\naveraged over ~100 Myr timescales, with long-term average AGN accretion rates\nthat are perfectly correlated with the star formation rate (SFR).

Inflowing gas is dominated by\nenriched material that was previously ejected in an outflow, hence accretion at\nlow redshifts is typically substantially enriched. Recycling wind material is\npreferentially found closer to galaxies, and is more dominant in lower-mass\nhalos since high-mass halos have more hot gas that is able to support itself\nagainst infall.

This common sense\ndepends on the assumption that Einstein's general relativity is valid at the\nearly universe. In this paper we show that nearly scale-invariant primordial\ntensor perturbations can be generated during a contracting phase before the\nradiation dominated epoch if the theory of gravity is modified by the\nscalar-tensor theory at that time. The scale-invariance protects the tensor\nperturbations from suppressing at large scales and they may have significant\namplitudes to fit BICEP2's result. We construct a model to achieve this purpose\nand show that the universe can bounce to the hot big bang after long time\ncontraction, and at almost the same time the theory of gravity approaches to\ngeneral relativity through stabilizing the scalar field. Theoretically, such\nmodels are dual to inflation models if we change to the frame in which the\ntheory of gravity is general relativity. Dual models are related by the\nconformal transformations. With this study we reinforce the point that only the\nconformal invariant quantities such as the scalar and tensor perturbations are\nphysical. How did the background evolve before the radiation time depends on\nthe frame and has no physical meaning. It is impossible to distinguish\ndifferent pictures by later time cosmological probes. \n\n"}

If the source of the viscosity is powered by\naccretion, such as in the case of the magneto-rotational instability, such\ndistant energy sources must lie in the innermost regions of the disk, where\naccretion occurs even at the midplane. We argue here that modulations in this\nenergy supply can alter the accretion rate on dynamical, rather than far longer\nviscous, time scales. This means that both the steady state value of and\nfluctuations in the inner disk's accretion rate, depending on the details of\nthe inner boundary condition and occurring on the inner disk's rapid evolution\ntime, can affect the outer disk. This is particularly interesting because\nobservations have shown that disk accretion is not steady (e.g.~EX Lupi type\nobjects).

Even though the\nstellar mass of the host galaxies may be as large as\n$10^{11}-10^{12}~M_{\\odot}$, the AGN emission, with luminosities comparable to\nthose of the most luminous QSOs known, require that either Hot DOGs have black\nhole masses significantly in excess of the local relations, or that they\nradiate significantly above the Eddington limit. We show that, while rare, the\nnumber density of Hot DOGs is comparable to that of equally luminous but\nunobscured (i.e., Type 1) QSOs. This is inconsistent with the trend of a\ndiminishing fraction of obscured objects with increasing luminosity found for\nless luminous QSOs, possibly indicating a reversal in this relation at high\nluminosity, and that Hot DOGs are not the torus-obscured counterparts of the\nknown optically selected, largely unobscured Hyper-Luminous QSOs.

While lensing usually\nconstrains the overall, projected mass density, the innovative use of velocity\ndispersion measurements as a proxy for masses of individual cluster members\nbreaks inherent degeneracies and allows us to (a) refine the constraints on\nsingle galaxy masses and on the galaxy mass-to-light scaling relation and, as a\nresult, (b) refine the constraints on the DM-only map, a high-end goal of lens\nmodelling. The knowledge of cluster member velocity dispersions improves the\nfit by 17% in terms of the image reproduction $\\chi^2$, or 20% in terms of the\nrms. The constraints on the mass parameters improve by ~10% for the DH, while\nfor the galaxy component, they are refined correspondingly by ~50%, including\nthe galaxy halo truncation radius.

In this paper we\npresent further observations of this region (194 hours in total over ~250\ndeg^2), both in intensity and in polarization.

The four QUIJOTE data\npoints provide the first independent confirmation of the downturn of the AME\nspectrum at low frequencies, initially unveiled by the COSMOSOMAS experiment in\nthis region.

These discrepancies suggest that both wind\nmodels predict too much cool, metal-enriched gas and not enough hot gas, and/or\nthat the metals are not sufficiently well-mixed. This may reflect our model\nassumption of ejecting outflows as cool and unmixing gas.

To test the fidelity of\ngroup catalogue inferred statistics, we run three different group finders used\nin the literature over a mock that includes galaxy colours in a realistic\nmanner. Overall, the resulting mock group catalogues are remarkably similar,\nand most colour-dependent statistics are recovered with reasonable accuracy.\nHowever, it is also clear that certain systematic errors arise as a consequence\nof correlated errors in group membership determination, central/satellite\ndesignation, and halo mass assignment. We introduce a new statistic, the halo\ntransition probability (HTP), which captures the combined impact of all these\nerrors. As a rule of thumb, errors tend to equalize the properties of distinct\ngalaxy populations (i.e. red vs. blue galaxies or centrals vs. satellites), and\nto result in inferred occupation statistics that are more accurate for red\ngalaxies than for blue galaxies. A statistic that is particularly poorly\nrecovered from the group catalogues is the red fraction of central galaxies as\nfunction of halo mass. Group finders do a good job in recovering galactic\nconformity, but also have a tendency to introduce weak conformity when none is\npresent. We conclude that proper inference of colour-dependent statistics from\ngroup catalogues is best achieved using forward modelling (i.e., running group\nfinders over mock data), or by implementing a correction scheme based on the\nHTP, as long as the latter is not too strongly model-dependent. \n\n"}

Over three years of multi-band VLA\nradio observations of the 2010 nova V1723 Aql show that shocks between fast and\nslow flows within the ejecta led to the acceleration of particles and the\nproduction of synchrotron radiation. Soon after the start of the eruption,\nshocks in the ejecta produced an unexpected radio flare, resulting in a\nmulti-peaked radio light curve. The emission eventually became consistent with\nan expanding thermal remnant with mass $2 \\times 10^{-4} M_\\odot$ and\ntemperature $10^4$ K. However, during the first two months, the $\\gtrsim 10^6$\nK brightness temperature at low frequencies was too high to be due to thermal\nemission from the small amount of X-ray producing shock-heated gas. Radio\nimaging showed structures with velocities of 400 km s$^{-1}$ (d/6 kpc) in the\nplane of the sky, perpendicular to a more elongated 1500 km s$^{-1}$ (d/6 kpc)\nflow. The morpho-kinematic structure of the ejecta from V1723 Aql appears\nsimilar to nova V959 Mon, where collisions between a slow torus and a faster\nflow collimated the fast flow and gave rise to \\gamma -ray producing shocks.\nOptical spectroscopy and X-ray observations of V1723 Aql during the radio flare\nare consistent with this picture. Our observations support the idea that shocks\nin novae occur when a fast flow collides with a slow collimating torus. Such\nshocks could be responsible for hard X-ray emission, \\gamma -ray production,\nand double-peaked radio light curves from some classical novae. \n\n"}

Over the last few years,\nthe theoretical understanding of magnetic reconnection in large-scale fluid\nsystems has undergone a major paradigm shift. The steady-state model of\nreconnection described by the famous Sweet-Parker (SP) theory, which dominated\nthe field for ~50 years, has been replaced with an essentially time-dependent,\nbursty picture of the reconnection layer, dominated by the continuous formation\nand ejection of multiple secondary islands (plasmoids). Whereas in the SP model\nreconnection was predicted to be slow, a major implication of this new paradigm\nis that reconnection in fluid systems is fast (i.e., independent of the\nLundquist number), provided that the system is large enough. This conceptual\nshift hinges on the realization that SP-like current layers are violently\nunstable to the plasmoid instability - implying, therefore, that such current\nsheets are super-critically unstable and thus can never form in the first\nplace.

All current\nmodels addressing this question are one-dimensional and do not account for the\nfact that magnetic fields can effectively channel ions and electrons, leading\nto anisotropic transport of momentum, heat, and particle diffusion in the\nweakly collisional intracluster medium (ICM). This anisotropy can lead to a\nwide variety of instabilities, which could be relevant for understanding the\ndynamics of heterogeneous media. In this paper, we consider the radial\ntemperature and composition profiles as obtained from a state-of-the-art Helium\nsedimentation model and analyze its stability properties. We find that the\nassociated radial profiles are unstable, to different kinds of instabilities\ndepending on the magnetic field orientation, at all radii. The fastest growing\nmodes are usually related to generalizations of the Magnetothermal Instability\n(MTI) and the Heat-flux-driven Buoyancy Instability (HBI) which operate in\nheterogeneous media. We find that the effect of sedimentation is to increase\n(decrease) the predicted growth rates in the inner (outer) cluster region.

Suitable celestial\ncalibration sources that could be used to measure the polarimeter orientation\nangle are limited, so current experiments commonly `self-calibrate.' The\nself-calibration method exploits the theoretical fact that the $EB$ and $TB$\ncross-spectra of the CMB vanish in the standard cosmological model, so any\ndetected $EB$ and $TB$ signals must be due to systematic errors. However, this\nassumption neglects the fact that polarized Galactic foregrounds in a given\nportion of the sky may have non-zero $EB$ and $TB$ cross-spectra. If these\nforeground signals remain in the observations, then they will bias the\nself-calibrated telescope polarisation angle and produce a spurious $B$-mode\nsignal. In this paper we estimate the foreground-induced bias for various\ninstrument configurations and then expand the self-calibration formalism to\naccount for polarized foreground signals.

Abstract: We use cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of the APOSTLE project along\nwith high-quality rotation curve observations to examine the fraction of\nbaryons in {\\Lambda}CDM haloes that collect into galaxies. This 'galaxy\nformation efficiency' correlates strongly and with little scatter with halo\nmass, dropping steadily towards dwarf galaxies. The baryonic mass of a galaxy\nmay thus be used to place a lower limit on total halo mass and, consequently,\non its asymptotic maximum circular velocity. A number of observed dwarfs seem\nto violate this constraint, having baryonic masses up to ten times higher than\nexpected from their rotation speeds, or, alternatively, rotating at only half\nthe speed expected for their mass. Taking the data at face value, either these\nsystems have formed galaxies with extraordinary efficiency - highly unlikely\ngiven their shallow potential wells - or their dark matter content is much\nlower than expected from {\\Lambda}CDM haloes. This 'missing dark matter' is\nreminiscent of the inner mass deficit of galaxies with slowly-rising rotation\ncurves, but cannot be explained away by star formation-induced 'cores' in the\ndark mass profile, since the anomalous deficit applies to regions larger than\nthe luminous galaxies themselves.

However, its detection requires a thorough\nunderstanding and control of the systematic errors. We study two systematic\nbiases observed in the LOFAR EoR residual data after calibration and\nsubtraction of bright discrete foreground sources. The first effect is a\nsuppression in the diffuse foregrounds, which could potentially mean a\nsuppression of the 21 cm signal. The second effect is an excess of noise beyond\nthe thermal noise. The excess noise shows fluctuations on small frequency\nscales, and hence it can not be easily removed by foreground removal or\navoidance methods. Our analysis suggests that sidelobes of residual sources due\nto the chromatic point spread function and ionospheric scintillation can not be\nthe dominant causes of the excess noise. Rather, both the suppression of\ndiffuse foregrounds and the excess noise can occur due to calibration with an\nincomplete sky model containing predominantly bright discrete sources. We show\nthat calibrating only on bright sources can cause suppression of other signals\nand introduce an excess noise in the data. The levels of the suppression and\nexcess noise depend on the relative flux of sources which are not included in\nthe model with respect to the flux of modeled sources. We discuss possible\nsolutions such as using only long baselines to calibrate the interferometric\ngain solutions as well as simultaneous multi-frequency calibration along with\ntheir benefits and shortcomings. \n\n"}

Efficient pebble\naccretion is likely to be unavoidable in transition disc dust traps, as the\nsize of the dust particles required for pebble accretion are those which are\nmost efficiently trapped in the transition disc dust trap. Rapid pebble\naccretion within the dust trap gives rise, not only to low-mass planets, but to\na large accretion luminosity. This accretion luminosity is sufficient to heat\nthe disc outside the gravitational influence of the planet and makes the disc\nlocally baroclinic, and a source of vorticity.

The primary component is cold and collisionless. The\nsecondary component is also cold, but interacts strongly with dark radiation,\nwhich itself forms a tightly coupled fluid. The growth of density perturbations\nin the subdominant component is inhibited by dark acoustic oscillations due to\nits coupling to the dark radiation, solving the $\\sigma_8$ problem, while the\npresence of tightly coupled dark radiation ameliorates the $H_0$ problem. The\nsubdominant component of dark matter and dark radiation continue to remain in\nthermal equilibrium until late times, inhibiting the formation of a dark disk.\nWe present an example of a simple model that naturally realizes this scenario\nin which both constituents of dark matter are thermal WIMPs. Our scenario can\nbe tested by future stage-IV experiments designed to probe the CMB and large\nscale structure. \n\n"}

Various\ntwo-color diagrams, using the half-light aperture defined in the 2MASS J\nfilter, are very coherent from color to color, meaning that galaxies defined to\nbe red in one color are always red in other colors. Comparison to globular\ncluster colors demonstrates that ellipticals are *not* composed of a single\nage, single metallicity (e.g., [Fe/H]) stellar population, but require a\nmulti-metallicity model using a chemical enrichment scenario. Such a model is\nsufficient to explain two-color diagrams and the color-magnitude relations for\nall colors using only metallicity as a variable on a solely 12 Gyrs stellar\npopulation with no evidence of stars younger than 10 Gyrs.

The trend with geometric\nenvironment is reversed at large halo mass, with haloes in knots being younger\nthan haloes of the same mass in voids.

Suppressed\n  growth of dark matter halos during the Epoch of Reionization Abstract: We investigate how the hydrostatic suppression of baryonic accretion affects\nthe growth rate of dark matter halos during the Epoch of Reionization. By\ncomparing halo properties in a simplistic hydrodynamic simulation in which gas\nonly cools adiabatically, with its collisionless equivalent, we find that halo\ngrowth is slowed as hydrostatic forces prevent gas from collapsing. In our\nsimulations, at the high redshifts relevant for reionization (between ${\\sim}6$\nand ${\\sim}11$), halos that host dwarf galaxies ($\\lesssim 10^{9}\n\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$) can be reduced by up to a factor of 2 in mass due to the\nhydrostatic pressure of baryons. Consequently, the inclusion of baryonic\neffects reduces the amplitude of the low mass tail of the halo mass function by\nfactors of 2 to 4. In addition, we find that the fraction of baryons in dark\nmatter halos hosting dwarf galaxies at high redshift never exceeds ${\\sim}90\\%$\nof the cosmic baryon fraction. When implementing baryonic processes, including\ncooling, star formation, supernova feedback and reionization, the suppression\neffects become more significant with further reductions of ${\\sim}30\\%$ to\n60\\%.

Because the Alfv\\'en speed\nvaries with distance from the disk, the AWs undergo partial non-WKB reflection,\nand counter-propagating AWs subsequently interact, causing AW energy to cascade\nto small scales and dissipate. To investigate this process, we introduce an\nElsasser-like formulation of general relativistic MHD (GRMHD) and develop the\ntheory of general relativistic reduced MHD in an inhomogeneous medium. We then\nderive a set of equations for the mean-square AW amplitude $M_+$ and turbulent\nheating rate $Q$ under the assumption that, in the plasma rest frame, AWs\npropagating away from the disk are much more energetic than AWs propagating\ntoward the disk. For the case in which the background flow is axisymmetric and\ntime-independent, we solve these equations analytically to determine $M_+$ and\n$Q$ as functions of position. We find that, for an idealized thin disk threaded\nby a large-scale poloidal magnetic field, the AW energy flux is $\\sim\n(\\rho_{\\rm b}/\\rho_{\\rm d})^{1/2} \\beta_{\\rm net,d}^{-1/2}$ times the disk's\nradiative flux, where $\\rho_{\\rm b}$ and $\\rho_{\\rm d}$ are the mass densities\nat the coronal base and disk midplane, respectively, and $\\beta_{\\rm net,d}$ is\nthe ratio (evaluated at the disk midplane) of plasma-plus-radiation pressure to\nthe pressure of the average vertical magnetic field.

This resonant tide can induce phase shift in the\ngravitational waveforms, and potentially provide a new window of studying NS\ninterior using gravitational waves. Previous works have considered tidal\nexcitations of pure g-modes (due to stable stratification of the star) and pure\ninertial modes (due to Coriolis force), with the rotational effect treated in\nan approximate manner. However, for realistic NSs, the buoyancy and rotational\neffects can be comparable, giving rise to mixed inertial-gravity modes. We\ndevelop a non-perturbative numerical spectral code to compute the frequencies\nand tidal coupling coefficients of these modes. We then calculate the phase\nshift in the gravitational waveform due to each resonance during binary\ninspiral. We adopt polytropic NS models with a parameterized stratification. We\nderive relevant scaling relations and survey how the phase shift depends on\nvarious properties of the NS. We find that for canonical NSs (with mass M =\n1.4M_sun and radius R = 10 km) and modest rotation rates (< 300 Hz), the\ngravitational wave phase shift due to a resonance is generally less than 0.01\nradian. But the phase shift is a strong function of R and M, and can reach a\nradian or more for low-mass NSs with larger radii (R > 15 km). Significant\nphase shift can also be produced when the combination of stratification and\nrotation gives rise to a very low frequency (< 20 Hz in the inertial frame)\nmodified g-mode. We also find that some inertial modes can be strongly affected\nby stratification, and that the m = 1 r-mode, previously identified to have a\nsmall but finite inertial-frame frequency based on the Cowling approximation,\nin fact has essentially zero frequency, and therefore cannot be excited. \n\n"}

In gas rich\nenvironments, it has been shown that a putative extended, steady circumbinary\ngaseous disc plays an important role in the MBHB evolution, facilitating its\ncoalescence. How gas on galactic scales is transported to the nuclear region to\nform and maintain such a stable structure is, however, unclear. If, following a\ngalaxy merger, turbulent gas is condenses in cold clumps and filaments that are\nrandomly scattered, gas is naturally transported on parsec scales and interacts\nwith the MBHB in discrete incoherent pockets. The aim of this work is to\ninvestigate the gaseous structures arising from this interaction. We employ a\nsuite of smoothed-particle-hydrodynamic simulations to study the formation and\nevolution of gaseous structures around a MBHB constantly perturbed by the\nincoherent infall of molecular clouds.

Based on analytic considerations\nand verified with an extensive set of 2D axisymmetric relativistic hydrodynamic\nsimulations, we have estimated a threshold intrinsic jet luminosity, $L_{\\rm\nj}^{\\rm thr}$, for successfully launching a jet. This threshold depends on the\nstructure of the progenitor and, thus, it is sensible to its mass and to its\nmetallicity.

Here we find that\nthe first six binary black hole (BBH) merging events reported by LIGO/Virgo\nshow clear evidence for lensing in the plane of observed mass and source\ndistance. The four lowest frequency events follow an apparent locus in this\nplane, which we can reproduce by galaxy lensing, where the higher the\nmagnification, the generally more distant the source so the wave train is\nstretched more by the Universal expansion, by factors of 2-4. This revises the\nreported BBH distances upwards by an order of magnitude, equal to the square\nroot of the magnification. Furthermore, the reported black hole masses must be\ndecreased by 2-4 to counter the larger stretch factor, since the orbital\nfrequency is used to derive the black hole masses. This lowers the masses to\n5-15 solar masses, well below the puzzlingly high values of 20-35 solar masses\notherwise estimated, with the attraction of finding agreement in mass with\nblack holes orbiting stars in our own Galaxy, thereby implying a stellar origin\nfor the low frequency events in the far Universe.

We characterize stars surrounding the region of the Li\ndesert. We conclude that stars with low Li abundances below the desert are more\nmassive and more evolved than stars above the desert. Given the unexpected\npresence of low Li abundance stars in this effective temperature range, we\nconcentrate on finding their origin. We conclude that these stars with low Li\nabundance do not evolve from stars above the desert: at a given mass, stars\nwith low Li (i.e., below the desert) are more metal-poor. Instead, we suggest\nthat stars below the Li desert are consistent with having evolved from the Li\ndip, discarding the need to invoke additional mixing to explain this feature.\nThus, stars below the Li desert are not peculiar and are only distinguished\nfrom other subgiants evolved from the Li dip in that their combination of\natmospheric parameters locates them in a range of effective temperatures where\notherwise only high Li abundance stars would be found (i.e., stars above the\ndesert). \n\n"}

While it originates from many physical processes, for star-forming\ngalaxies the intrinsic Lya luminosity is a direct tracer of the Lyman-continuum\n(LyC) radiation produced by the most massive O- and early-type B-stars with\nlifetimes of a few Myrs. As such, Lya luminosity should be an excellent\ninstantaneous star formation rate (SFR) indicator. However, its resonant nature\nand susceptibility to dust as a rest-frame UV photon makes Lya very hard to\ninterpret due to the uncertain Lya escape fraction, f$_{esc,Ly\\alpha}$.

We derive a simple empirical relation\nthat robustly retrieves f$_{esc,Ly\\alpha}$ as a function of Lya rest-frame EW\n(EW$_0$): f$_{esc,Ly\\alpha}$= 0.0048 EW$_0$[A]$\\pm0.05$ and we show that it\nconstrains a well-defined anti-correlation between ionisation efficiency and\ndust extinction in LAEs. Observed Lya luminosities and EW$_0$ are easy\nmeasurable quantities at high redshift, thus making our relation a practical\ntool to estimate intrinsic Lya and LyC luminosities under well controlled and\nsimple assumptions. Our results allow observed Lya luminosities to be used to\ncompute SFRs for LAEs at z~0-2.6 within 0.2 dex of the Ha dust corrected SFRs.\nWe apply our empirical SFR(Lya,EW$_0$) calibration to several sources at z>2.6\nto find that star-forming LAEs have SFRs typically ranging from 0.1 to 20\nM$_{\\odot}$/yr and that our calibration might be even applicable for the most\nluminous LAEs within the epoch of re-ionisation.

Similarly to the cloud Sgr B2, another well-known emitter of the\niron line in the GC, the Arches cloud demonstrates temporal decline of the\nX-ray emission. The most natural origin of this emission is irradiation of\nprimary photons of an X-ray flare from a distant source, most likely Sgr A*.\nHowever, recent observations of the Arches cloud discovered variations of\nequivalent width of the 6.4 keV iron line, which indicated that the X-ray\nemission from the cloud is a combination of two components with different\norigin and different equivalent width, one of which is time-variable, while the\nother is stationary during the period of observations. We considered two\ndifferent scenarios: a) this emission is formed by reflection from two clouds,\nwhich are at some distance from each other, when they are irradiated by two\ndifferent flares; and b) the other scenario assumes a combination of X-ray\nfluxes produced in the same cloud by reflection of primary photons and by\nsubrelativistic cosmic rays. We present restrictions for both model and\nconditions at which these scenarios can be realized. Although none of the\nmodels can be completely ruled out, we find that the X-ray reflection model\nrequires less assumption and therefore is the most viable. \n\n"}

In this work, we use data\nfrom the X-ATLAS and XMM-XXL North fields and compile the largest X-ray sample\nup to date, to investigate how X-ray AGN affect the star-formation of their\nhost galaxies in a wide redz and luminosity baseline, i.e., 0.03<z<3 and log LX\n(2-10 keV)= (41-45.5) ergs-1. Our sample consists of 3336 AGN. 1872 X-ray\nobjects have spectroscopic redz. For the remaining sources we calculate\nphotometric redz using TPZ, a machine-learning algorithm. We estimate stellar\nmasses (M*) and Star Formation Rates (SFRs) by applying SED fitting through the\nCIGALE code, using optical, near-IR and mid-IR photometry. 608 of our sources\nalso have far-IR photometry (Herschel). We use these sources to calibrate the\nSFR calculations of the rest of our X-ray sample. Our results show a\ncorrelation between the LX and the SFR, at all redz and LX spanned by our\nsample. We also find a dependence of the specific SFR (sSFR) on redz, while\nthere are indications that LX enhances the sSFR even at low redz. We then\ndisentangle the effects of M* and redz on the SFR and study again its\ndependence on the LX. Towards this end, we use the Schreiber et al. formula to\nestimate the SFR of main sequence galaxies that have the same stellar mass and\nredshift as our X-ray AGN. Our analysis reveals that the AGN enhances the\nstar-formation of its host galaxy, when the galaxy lies below the main sequence\nand quenches the star-formation of the galaxy it lives in, when the host lies\nabove the main sequence. Therefore, the effect of AGN on the SFR of the host\ngalaxy, depends on the location of the galaxy relative to the main sequence. \n\n"}

First, we discuss their contribution to\nthe diffuse neutrino intensity taking into account various observational\nconstraints. Blazars are likely to be subdominant in the diffuse neutrino\nintensity at sub-PeV energies, and we show that blazar flares like those of TXS\n0506+056 could make <1-10 percent of the total neutrino intensity. We also\nargue that the neutrino output of blazars can be dominated by the flares in the\nstandard leptonic scenario for their gamma-ray emission, and energetic flares\nmay still be detected with a rate of <1 per year. Second, we consider\nmulti-messenger constraints on the source modeling.

Recently IMBHs have started to be observed\nat the centers of low-mass galaxies. We perform cosmological hydrodynamical\nsimulations of $(2 h^{-1} ~ {\\rm Mpc})^3$ comoving boxes and investigate the\ngrowth and feedback of central IMBHs in dwarf galaxies (DGs). The earliest BHs\nappear at $z \\sim 18 - 25$, and grow thereafter by accreting gas and by merger\nwith other BHs. We find that, starting from $10^{2} M_{\\odot}$, it is possible\nto build up IMBHs of a few$\\times 10^{5} - 10^{6} M_{\\odot}$ by $z = 5$, when\nthe BHs are seeded in halos less massive than $4 \\times 10^{7} M_{\\odot}$. The\nBH accretion rates increase with time, and reaches $\\dot{M}_{\\rm BH} = (0.2 -\n0.8) \\dot{M}_{\\rm Edd}$ for the massive IMBHs by $z = 4$. The star formation\nrate density (SFRD) evolution of the DGs (stellar mass $10^{5} - 10^{8}\nM_{\\odot}$) has a peak plateau between $z = 4 - 6$. Star formation is quenched\nbetween $z = 9 - 4$. The SFRD is reduced by factors up to $3$, when the BHs\nhave grown to a few times $10^5 M_{\\odot}$. Even in the presence of stronger\nSN-driven mass ejection, the BHs continue to grow up to $z \\sim 6$, sustained\nby gas inflows driven by galaxy mergers and interactions in a cosmological\nenvironment.

Tipler showed that this CBR\nproperty would also mean the Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR) would\npropagate a factor of ten further than standard theory predicts, since most of\nthe cross section for pion production when a UHECR hits a CBR photon is due to\na quark spin flip, and such a flip cannot occur if a CBR particle cannot couple\nto right-handed quarks.

While the primordial cutoff delays the formation of the first\ngalaxies, structure builds-up more rapidly in the interacting DM model compared\nto CDM.

The exquisite stable high spatial\nresolution combined with photometric accuracy of images from the Hubble Space\nTelescope have allowed us to probe further back into the history of star\nformation of a large variety of different galaxy types with widely differing\nstar formation properties. We have learnt several important things about dwarf\ngalaxy evolution from these studies. Firstly we have found that no two galaxies\nhave identical star formation histories; some galaxies may superficially look\nthe same today, but they have invariably followed different paths to this\npoint. Now that we have managed to probe deep into the star formation history\nof dwarf irregular galaxies in the Local Group it is obvious that there are a\nnumber of similarities with the global properties of dwarf\nelliptical/spheroidal type galaxies, which were previously thought to be quite\ndistinct. The previous strong dichotomy between these two classes has been\nweakened by these new results and may stem from the differences in the\nenvironment in which these similar mass galaxies were born into or have\ninhabited for most of their lives.

A negative detection in several\nall-sky films taken simultaneously to the event implies either a previous\nadditional break prior to 2 d after the occurrence of the GRB (as expected from\nthe jet effect). The existence of a second break might indicate a steepening in\nthe electron spectrum or the superposition of two events. Once the afterglow\nemission vanished, contribution of a bright underlying SN is found, but the\nlight curve is not sufficiently well sampled to rule out a dust echo\nexplanation.

We choose pseudo-Newtonian approach to\ndescribe the relativistic accretion disk. For this purpose, the new\npseudo-Newtonian potential is used which is applicable to describe the\nrelativistic properties of star and its disk. As we know, the Hartle-Thorne\nmetric can describe geometry of star as well as the space-time out-side of it,\nwe use this metric for our study. This potential reproduces the marginally\nstable orbit exactly as that of general relativity. It also reproduces the\nmarginally bound orbit and specific mechanical energy at the marginally stable\norbit with at most 4% and 10% error respectively.

Stars and galaxies form only from the cool gas fraction. Hot gas is\nejected from low-mass systems as in conventional semi-analytic models of galaxy\nformation.

As the universe expands by a factor of 1.3, we find\nthat between 20 and 40 percent of well-resolved SUSY substructure is destroyed,\ncompared to only about 1 percent in the low-redshift cluster. Nevertheless SUSY\nsubstructure is just as abundant as in z=0 galaxy clusters, i.e. the normalized\nmass and circular velocity functions are very similar. The dark matter\nself-annihilation gamma-ray luminosity from bound subhalos and other deviations\nfrom a smooth spherical configuration is at least comparable to the\nspherically-averaged signal in the SUSY host, and at least three times larger\nthan the spherically-averaged signal in the cluster host.

For reliable results this method requires very\naccurate relative laboratory wavelengths for a number of UV resonance\ntransitions from several different ionic species. For this purpose laboratory\nwavelengths and wavenumbers of 23 UV lines from MgI, MgII, TiII, CrII, MnII,\nFeII and ZnII have been measured using high-resolution Fourier Transform (FT)\nspectrometry. The spectra of the different ions (except for one FeII line, one\nMgI line and the TiII lines) are all measured simultaneously in the same FT\nspectrometry recording by using a composite hollow cathode as a light source.\nThis decreases the relative uncertainties of all the wavelengths. In addition\nto any measurement uncertainty, the wavelength uncertainty is determined by\nthat of the ArII calibration lines, by possible pressure shifts and by\nillumination effects. The absolute wavenumbers have uncertainties of typically\n0.001 to 0.002 cm^(-1) (0.06 to 0.1 mAA at 2500 AA), while the relative\nwavenumbers for strong, symmetric lines in the same spectral recording have\nuncertainties of 0.0005 cm^(-1) (0.03 mAA at 2500 AA) or better, depending\nmostly on uncertainties in the line fitting procedure.

Our main result is\nthat outflow parameterizations based on momentum-driven winds as seen in local\nstarburst galaxies provide the best agreement with observations of CIV\nabsorption at z~2-5. Such models sufficiently enrich the high-z IGM to produce\na global mass density of CIV absorbers that is relatively invariant from z=5.5\nto 1.5, in agreement with observations. This occurs despite an increase in the\nvolume-averaged metallicity by x5-10 over this redshift range, because energy\ninput from outflows causes a drop in the global ionization fraction of CIV.\nComparisons to observed CIV column density and linewidth distributions and\nCIV-based pixel optical depth ratios provide significant constraints on wind\nmodels. Our best-fitting models show mean IGM temperatures only slightly above\nour no-outflow case, metal filling factors of just a few % with volume-weighted\nmetallicities around 0.001 at z~3, significant amounts of collisionally-ionized\nCIV absorption, and a metallicity-density relationship that rises rapidly at\nlow overdensities and flattens at higher ones.

It is therefore\nnon-trivial that locally-calibrated momentum-driven wind scenarios naturally\nyield the desired strength and evolution of outflows, and suggest that such\nmodels represent a significant step towards understanding the impact of\ngalactic outflows on galaxies and the IGM across cosmic time. \n\n"}

This assumption is naturally\nfulfilled in the internal shock scenario. The dissipated energy is partially\nused to accelerate electrons and to amplify the magnetic field. This process\ncreates a source inside the jet (blob). Such blobs may efficiently produce\nsynchrotron and inverse Compton emission. We find that even if the blobs or\nshells responsible for the blazar activity carry the same energy (in bulk\nkinetic form), the fact that they move at different Gamma can produce dramatic\nvariations in different bands, even if the bolometric luminosity is instead\nvery similar. This is due to the relative importance of the synchrotron,\nself-Compton and external Compton radiation processes, which greatly changes by\nchanging Gamma and the compactness of the source, even if the total radiated\nenergy is constant.

This makes fewer assumptions than Fundamental\nPlane (FP) studies and provides a powerful new approach for studying galaxy\nevolution. We focus on the sample of 25 galaxies in clusters at z=0.5 modeled\nin Paper I. For comparison we compile and homogenize M/L literature data for 60\nnearby galaxies that were modeled in comparable detail. The nearby sample obeys\nlog(M/L)_B = Z + S log(sigma_eff/[200 km/s]), with Z = 0.896 +/- 0.010, S =\n0.992 +/- 0.054, and sigma_eff the effective velocity dispersion. The z=0.5\nsample follows a similar relation but with lower zeropoint. The implied M/L\nevolution is Delta log(M/L) / Delta z = -0.457 +/- 0.046(random) +/-\n0.078(systematic), consistent with passive evolution following high-redshift\nformation. This agrees with the FP results for this sample by van Dokkum & van\nder Marel. This confirms that FP evolution tracks M/L evolution, which is an\nimportant verification of the assumptions that underly FP studies. However,\nwhile we find more FP evolution for galaxies of low sigma_eff (or low mass),\nthe dynamical M/L evolution instead shows little trend with sigma_eff. We argue\nthat this difference can be plausibly attributed to a combination of two\neffects: (a) evolution in structural galaxy properties other than M/L; and (b)\nthe neglect of rotational support in studies of FP evolution. The results leave\nthe question open whether the low-mass galaxies in the sample have younger\npopulation ages than the high-mass galaxies. This highlights the general\nimportance in the study of population ages for complementing dynamical\nmeasurements with broad-band colors or spectroscopic population diagnostics. \n\n"}

The rate of decrease of the pulsation period of the source (-10e-7\ns/s) is one of the fastest observed among accreting pulsars.

Each domain has a surface composed of vacuum wall that\nstores a significant amount of energy, and can collapse into the black hole.\nThis offers the way of massive primordial black holes formation in the early\nUniverse. \n\n"}

Why would it be so light? On another\nfront, recent cosmological observations and analyses appear to indicate that\nthe present universe is flat and accelerating, and that the present energy\ndensity is dominated by a ``dark variety'', with rho_V approximately\n(10^{-3}eV)^4.

{"id": "hep-ph/0305047", "contents": "Title: A New Method to Infere Which Type of Neutralinos Make Up Galactic Halos Abstract: Applying the microcanonical definition of entropy to a weakly interacting and\nself--gravitating neutralino gas, we evaluate the change in the local entropy\nper particle of this gas between the freeze out era and present day virialized\nhalo structures. An ``entropy consistency'' criterion emerges by comparing the\nobtained theoretical entropy per particle of the virialized halos with an\nempirical entropy per particle given in terms of dynamical halo variables of\nactual galactic structures. We apply this criterion to the cases when\nneutralinos are mostly B-inos and mostly Higgsinos, in conjunction with the\nusual ``abundance'' criterion requiring that present neutralino relic density\ncomplies with $0.2<\\Omega_{{\\tilde\\chi^1_0}} < 0.4$ for $h\\simeq 0.65$. The\njoint application of both criteria reveals that a much better fitting occurs\nfor the B-ino than for the Higgsino channels, so that the former seems to be a\nfavored channel along the mass range of $150 \\hbox{GeV} < m_{{\\tilde\\chi^1_0}}\n< 250 \\hbox{GeV}$. These results are consistent with neutralino annihilation\npatterns that emerge from recent theoretical analysis on cosmic ray positron\nexcess data reported by the HEAT collaboration. The suggested methodology can\nbe applied to test other annihilation channels of the neutralino, as well as\nother particle candidates of thermal WIMP gas relics. \n\n"}

The high-energy edges of\nthese dips are fixed, via the resonance energies, by the neutrino masses alone.\nTheir depths are determined by the cosmic neutrino background density, by the\ncosmological parameters determining the expansion rate of the universe, and by\nthe large redshift history of the cosmic neutrino sources. We investigate the\npossibility of determining the existence of the cosmic neutrino background\nwithin the next decade from a measurement of these absorption dips in the\nneutrino flux. As a by-product, we study the prospects to infer the absolute\nneutrino mass scale. We find that, with the presently planned neutrino\ndetectors (ANITA, Auger, EUSO, OWL, RICE, and SalSA) operating in the relevant\nenergy regime above 10^{21} eV, relic neutrino absorption spectroscopy becomes\na realistic possibility. It requires, however, the existence of extremely\npowerful neutrino sources, which should be opaque to nucleons and high-energy\nphotons to evade present constraints. Furthermore, the neutrino mass spectrum\nmust be quasi-degenerate to optimize the dip, which implies m_{nu} >~ 0.1 eV\nfor the lightest neutrino. With a second generation of neutrino detectors,\nthese demanding requirements can be relaxed considerably. \n\n"}

Such particles then play a\nrole of the messengers for the gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking during and\n(shortly) after the inflation and radiatively induce soft masses to all other\n$D$-flat directions. We show that during the preheating stage this\ngauge-mediated soft masses are typically much greater than the Hubble parameter\nduring inflation. The dramatic role is played by the supersymmetry (SUSY)\nbreaking due to the parametric resonance effect, which ensures that the\ninflaton predominantly decays into the bosons and not the fermions. Difference\nin the Fermi-Bose occupation numbers results in the large gauge-mediated soft\nmasses, which determine the post-inflationary evolution of the flat directions,\nsuggesting that nonthermal phase transitions mediated by gauge messengers may\nplay a crucial role in the Affelck-Dine mechanism for the generation of the\nbaryon asymmetry. \n\n"}
