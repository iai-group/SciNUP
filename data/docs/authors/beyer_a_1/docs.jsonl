This effect originates from the change of the\nshape of the vortex core due to non-equilibrium effects (similar to the\nmechanism of vortex motion instability in the Larkin-Ovchinnikov theory). The\nmoving vortex creates a deficit of quasiparticles in front of its motion and an\nexcess of quasiparticles behind the core of the moving vortex. This results in\nthe appearance of a wake (region with suppressed order parameter) behind the\nvortex which attracts other vortices resulting in an effective\ndirection-dependent interaction between vortices. When the vortex velocity $v$\nreaches the critical value $v_c$ quasi-phase slip lines (lines with fast vortex\nmotion) appear which may coexist with slowly moving vortices between such\nlines.

While the attractive Hubbard\nmodel can be regarded as the generalization of BCS to Bose Einstein\ncondensation (BEC) crossover to a lattice, we find that the BEC limit of this\nHubbard model is very different from that of jellium, owing to the strong\ninter-site repulsion between pairs, which becomes important near half filling\nwhen the on-site attraction is strong. A central conclusion of our work is that\nin a lattice, around half filling, the smooth evolution from the BCS to the BEC\nlimits is interrupted. For the attractive Hubbard model, $T_c$ vanishes when\nthe system approaches the bosonic regime with increasing interaction strength.\nWe suggest that the vanishing of $T_c$ at strong coupling strength may signal a\nquantum critical transition to another form of superfluid not continuously\nconnected to a BCS-like phase.

However, the macroscopic symmetry of such an extended s'-wave state\nstill belongs to the general s-wave category, raising the question of how to\ndistinguish it from an ordinary s-wave.

And, in the nearly filled (with negative\nelectrons) bands of almost all superconductors, as evidenced by their positive\nHall coefficient in the normal state. According to the theory of hole\nsuperconductivity, metals become superconducting because they are driven to\nexpel negative charge (electrons) from their interior. This is why NIS\ntunneling spectra are asymmetric, with larger current for negatively biased\nsamples. It is also why there is a Meissner effect: as electrons are expelled\ntowards the surface in the presence of a magnetic field, the Lorentz force\nimparts them with azimuthal velocity, thus generating the surface Meissner\ncurrent that screens the interior magnetic field. In type II superconductors,\nthe Lorentz force acting on expelled electrons that don't reach the surface\ngives rise to the azimuthal velocity of the vortex currents.

The second paradox is a clear\nsignature of a small electron pocket in quantum oscillation experiments, but no\nevidence as yet of the corresponding hole pockets of approximately double the\nfrequency of the electron pocket. This hole pockets should be present if the\nFermi surface reconstruction is due to a commensurate density wave, assuming\nthat Luttinger sum rule relating the area of the pockets and the total number\nof charge carriers holds.

The goal of the paper is two-fold.\nFirst, we analyze the dependence of W on the upper cut-off w_c placed on the\noptical integral because in experiments W is measured up to frequencies of\norder bandwidth. For a BCS model, the Kubo sum rule is almost fully reproduced\nat w_c equal to the bandwidth.

The mechanism behind that resides in the\nstructural incompatibility of two stereo-chemical configurations Cu$^{\\rm\nII}$O$_4$ and Cu$^{\\rm III}$O$_4$ which compose the CuO$_2$ planes. It leads to\nspontaneously fluctuating Cu - O - Cu valence bonds which establish a local\nFeshbach resonance exchange coupling between bound and unbound electron pairs.\nThe coupling, being the only free parameter in this scenario, the hole doping\nof the parent state is monitored by varying the total number of unpaired and\npaired electrons, in chemical equilibrium with each other.

Our studies reveal that superconductivity in a\nhelical Dirac gas is distinctly different from that of in an ordinary\ntwo-dimensional superconductor while considering the spin degrees of freedom of\nelectrons. We further show that the pairing of Dirac electrons can be\nsuppressed by time-reversal symmetry breaking impurities removing the\ndistinction. Our demonstration and momentum-space imaging of Cooper pairing in\na half Dirac gas and its magnetic behavior taken together serve as a critically\nimportant 2D topological superconductor platform for future testing of novel\nfundamental physics predictions such as emergent supersymmetry and quantum\ncriticality in topological systems. \n\n"}

A drift-diffusion treatment of the\nanomalous Hall effect and the anisotropic magnetoresistance describes the spin\ncurrents that flow in directions perpendicular to the electric field. In\nsystems with two ferromagnetic layers separated by a spacer layer, an in-plane\nelectric field cause spin currents to be injected from one layer into the\nother, creating spin transfer torques.

Compared to the iron pnictides,\nthese systems have only electron Fermi pockets (i.e. no hole Fermi pockets) but\ncomparable superconducting transition temperatures. The challenge lies in\nreconciling the two basic experimental features of their superconducting state:\na node-less gap and the existence of a resonance in the spin excitation\nspectrum. We propose a mechanism based on reconstructing two quasi-degenerate\npairing states, one in an $s$-wave $A_{1g}$ channel that is fully gapped, and\nthe other in a $d$-wave $B_{1g}$ channel whose pairing function changes sign\nacross the electron Fermi pockets at the Brillouin-zone boundary. The resulting\nintermediate pairing state, which we call an orbital-selective $s \\times\n\\tau_3$ state, incorporates both of the above two properties. When the leading\nspin-singlet pairing is in the $d_{xz}, d_{yz}$ orbital subspace, this state\nretains the $s$-wave form factor but has a $B_{1g}$ symmetry due to an internal\n$\\tau_3$ structure in the orbital space.

The robust s-wave pairing throughout the different\nfamilies of iron-based superconductors at different doping regions signals two\nfundamental principles behind high T_c superconducting mechanisms: (1) the\ncorrespondence principle: the short range magnetic exchange interactions and\nthe Fermi surfaces act collaboratively to achieve high T_c superconductivity\nand determine pairing symmetries; (2) the magnetic selection pairing rule: the\nsuperconductivity is only induced by the magnetic exchange couplings from the\nsuperexchange mechanism through cation-anion-cation chemical bondings. These\nprinciples explain why the unconventional high T_c superconductivity appears to\nbe such a rare but robust phenomena with its strict requirement on electronic\nenvironment.

Without random field disorders (RFD), only one of the PDW\ncomponents survives. If the RFD is included, this state could become phase\nseparated and consist of short range PDW stripes, in which two PDW components\ncoexist but differ in magnitudes, resulting in charge density waves (CDW) and a\ntime-reversal symmetry breaking order, in the form of loop current, as\nsecondary composite orders.

Very lately, a new type of Weyl semimetals has been\nproposed where the Weyl Fermions emerge at the boundary between electron and\nhole pockets in a new phase of matter, which is distinct from the standard type\nI Weyl semimetals with a point-like Fermi surface. The Weyl cone in this type\nII semimetals is strongly tilted and the related Fermi surface undergos a\nLifshitz transition, giving rise to a new kind of chiral anomaly and other new\nphysics. MoTe2 is proposed to be a candidate of a type II Weyl semimetal; the\nsensitivity of its topological state to lattice constants and correlation also\nmakes it an ideal platform to explore possible topological phase transitions.\nBy performing laser-based angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) measurements\nwith unprecedentedly high resolution, we have uncovered electronic evidence of\ntype II semimetal state in MoTe2.

In crystals with\nhidden polarizations, a uniform electric field produces a staggered magnetic\nfield that points to opposite directions at atomic sites related by spatial\ninversion. As a result, the NMR resonance peak corresponding to inversion\npartner nuclei is split into two peaks.

To achieve this,\nwe extend this theory by self-consistently coupling the chemical potential to\nthe full set of Eliashberg equations. In this way, the electron filling can\naccurately be kept at a constant level at any temperature. Solving the coupled\nequations self-consistently, and with focus on the interfacial electron-phonon\ncoupling, we compute a nearly constant Fermi surface with respect to\ntemperature and predict a non-trivial temperature evolution of the global\nchemical potential.

The spin-up bands form two separate Weyl\nloops close to the Fermi level, which arise from band inversions and are\nprotected by the glide mirror symmetry. One loop is of type-I, whereas the\nother loop is of hybrid type. Corresponding to these two loops in the bulk, on\nthe (100) surface, there exist two fully spin-polarized drumheads of surface\nstates within the surface projections of the loops. The effects of the electron\ncorrelation and the spin-orbit coupling, as well as the possible hourglass Weyl\nchains in the nonmagnetic state have been discussed. The realization of fully\nspin-polarized Weyl-loop fermions in the bulk and drumhead fermions on the\nsurface for a half metal may generate promising applications in spintronics. \n\n"}

For the understanding of the rich physics of\nfullerides it is important to identify the different ground states. ESR has\nproven to be a useful technique for this purpose. However, since it is a very\nsensitive probe, it can detect a multitude of spin species and it is not\nstraightforward to identify their origin, especially in a system like\nNa_{2}Rb_{x}Cs_{1-x}C_{60} with three dopants, when one part of the sample\npolymerizes but the majority does not.

The\nconnection between quantum groups and strings is one way of seeing the validity\nof our previous conjecture [i.e. that a theory for cuprates may be constructed\non the basis of quantum groups]. The cuprates seems to exhibit statistics,\ndimensionality and phase transitions in novel ways. The nature of excitations\n[i.e. quasiparticle or collective] must be understood. The Hubbard model\ncaptures some of the behaviour of the phase transitions in these materials. On\nthe other hand the phases such as stripes in these materials bear relationship\nto quantum group or string-like solutions. One thus expects that the relevant\nsolutions of Hubbard model may thus be written in terms of stringy solutions.\nIn short this approach may lead to the non-perturbative formualtion of Hubbard\nand other condensed matter Hamiltonians. The question arises that how a 1-d\nbased symmetry such as quantum groups can be relevant in describing a 3-d\n[spatial dimensions] system such as cuprates. The answer lies in the key\nobservation that strings which are 1-d objects can be used to describe physics\nin $d$ dimensions.

Close to the\ntransition temperature $T_{c}$ fluctuations dominate and the correlation length\n$\\xi $ increases strongly when $T_{c}$ is approached. However, for nonzero\nmagnetic field $H$ there is another length scale $L_{H}=\\sqrt{\\Phi_{0}/aH}$\nwhere $a$ is a universal amplitude. It is comparable to the average distance\nbetween vortex lines. We show that the correlation length is bounded by this\nlength scale, so that $\\xi $ cannot grow beyond $L_{H}$. This implies that type\nII superconductors in a magnetic field do not undergo a phase transition to a\nstate with zero resistance. We sketch the scaling theory of the resulting\nmagnetic field induced finite size effect. In contrast to its inhomogeneity\ninduced counterpart, the magnetic length scale can be varied continuously in\nterms of the magnetic field strength. This opens the possibility to assess the\nimportance of fluctuations, to extract critical point properties of the\nhomogeneous system and to derive a lower bound for the length scale of\ninhomogeneities which affect thermodynamic properties.

In underdoped\nsamples it appears near room temperature and does not close with temperature.\nAnother related phenomenon that has been studied by infrared is the depression\nin the ab-plane scattering rate. Two separate effects can be discerned. At high\ntemperatures there is broad depression of scattering below 1000 cm-1 which may\nbe related to the gap in the density of states.

Our goal is\nto extend this Hartree approximated scheme to arrive at a generalized mean\nfield theory of pseudogapped superconductors for all temperatures $T$. While an\nequivalent approach to the pseudogap has been derived elsewhere using a more\nformal Green's function decoupling scheme, in this paper we re-interpret this\nmean field theory and BCS theory as well, and demonstrate how they naturally\nrelate to ideal Bose gas condensation. Here we recast the Hartree approximated\nGinzburg-Landau self consistent equations in a T-matrix form. This recasting\nmakes it possible to consider arbitrarily strong attractive coupling, where\nbosonic degrees of freedom appear at $ T^*$ considerably above $T_c$. The\nimplications for transport both above and below $T_c$ are discussed. Below\n$T_c$ we find two types of contributions.

That they depend on the\nmagnitude of the excitation gap, nevertheless, leads to rather atypical\ntransport properties in the strong coupling limit, where this gap (as distinct\nfrom the order parameter) is virtually $T$-independent.

Our protocol considerably increases the\nfidelity of the gate and, more important, it is quite robust in the disruptive\npresence of 1/f noise. The improvement in the gate performances discussed in\nthis work (errors of the order of 10^{-3}-10^{-4} in realistic cases) allows to\ncross the fault tolerance threshold. \n\n"}
