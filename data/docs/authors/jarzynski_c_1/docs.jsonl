Using the example of a massless scalar field\ntheory with a single Dirichlet boundary we explore the relationship between\nsuch approaches, with the goal of better understanding the origin of the\ndivergences. We are guided by the insight due to Dowker and Kennedy (1978) and\nDeutsch and Candelas (1979), that the divergences represent measurable effects\nthat can be interpreted with the aid of the theory of the asymptotic\ndistribution of eigenvalues of the Laplacian discussed by Weyl. In many cases\nthe Casimir self-energy is the sum of cutoff-dependent (Weyl) terms having\ngeometrical origin, and an \"intrinsic\" term that is independent of the cutoff.\nThe Weyl terms make a measurable contribution to the physical situation even\nwhen regularization methods succeed in isolating the intrinsic part.\nRegularization methods fail when the Weyl terms and intrinsic parts of the\nCasimir effect cannot be clearly separated.

Originally, the\n$H$-theorem and the information processing lemma were proved for the classical\nBoltzmann-Gibbs-Shannon entropy and for the correspondent divergence (the\nrelative entropy). Many new entropies and divergences have been proposed during\nlast decades and for all of them the $H$-theorem is needed.

We consider systems with $n$ states $A_i$ that obey first\norder kinetics (master equation). A convex function $H$ is a Lyapunov function\nfor all master equations with given equilibrium if and only if its conditional\nminima properly describe the equilibria of pair transitions $A_i\n\\rightleftharpoons A_j$.

In these cases, by studying the propagation of\ndecision changes via avalanches, we argue that macroscopic dynamics is\nwell-captured by a gradient flow along $E$. We focus on the\npermutation-symmetric case, where all $n$ choices are (on average) the same,\nand spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) arises purely from cooperative social\ninteractions. As examples, we show that bimodal heterogeneity naturally\nprovides a mechanism for the spontaneous formation of hierarchies between\ndecisions, and that SSB is a preferred instability to discontinuous phase\ntransitions between two symmetric points.

Rather than\npostulating them and investigating the consequence of each definition, as is\ncustomary, here we adopt a bottom-up approach and construct the entropy\nexpression within the microcanonical formalism upon two fundamental\nthermodynamic pillars: (i) The second law of thermodynamics as formulated for\nquasi-static processes: $\\delta Q/T$ is an exact differential, and (ii) the law\nof ideal gases: $PV=k_B NT$.

The modified Bloch-Redfield\nmaster equation allows an unambiguous distinction between the regimes of\nquantum coherent vs. incoherent energy transfer under incoherent light\nillumination. The fully incoherent regime is characterized by orthogonal\ntransition dipole moments in the energy basis, leading to a dynamical evolution\ngoverned by a coherence-free Pauli-type master equation.

At this precise value of\nfrustration, the classical model has a very large degeneracy which makes the\nproblem difficult to handle.

We focus on models based on the Temperley-Lieb algebra, and use\nthe concept of braid translation, which is a natural way to close an open spin\nchain by adding an interaction between the first and last spins using braiding\nto bring them next to each other. The interaction thus obtained is in general\nnon-local, but has the key feature that it is expressed solely in terms of the\nalgebra for the open spin chain - the ordinary Temperley-Lieb algebra and its\nblob algebra generalization. This is in contrast with the usual periodic spin\nchains which involve only local interactions, and are described by the periodic\nTL algebra. We show that for the Restricted Solid-On-Solid models, which are\nknown to be described by minimal unitary CFTs in the continuum limit, the braid\ntranslation in fact does provide the ordinary periodic model starting from the\nopen model with fixed boundary conditions on the two sides of the strip.

Once nucleation starts, we observe that crystallization follows three\ndifferent routes: direct crystallization of the liquid phase, Bergeron process,\nand Ostwald ripening. Nucleation starts inside the reorganised network, but\ncrystals grow past it by direct condensation of the gas phase on their surface,\ndriving liquid evaporation, and producing a network structure different from\nthe original phase separation pattern. We argue that similar crystal-gel states\ncan be formed in monoatomic and molecular systems if the liquid phase is slow\nenough to induce viscoelastic phase separation, but fast enough to prevent\nimmediate vitrification. This provides a novel pathway to form nano-porous\ncrystals of metals and semiconductors without dealloying, which may be\nimportant for catalytic, optical, sensing, and filtration applications. \n\n"}

In classic Erdos networks, which exhibit a\nPoissonian degree distribution, the number of appearances of a subgraph G with\nn nodes and g edges scales with network size as \\mean{G} ~ N^{n-g}. However,\nmany natural networks have a non-Poissonian degree distribution. Here we\npresent approximate equations for the average number of subgraphs in an\nensemble of random sparse directed networks, characterized by an arbitrary\ndegree sequence. We find new scaling rules for the commonly occurring case of\ndirected scale-free networks, in which the outgoing degree distribution scales\nas P(k) ~ k^{-\\gamma}. Considering the power exponent of the degree\ndistribution, \\gamma, as a control parameter, we show that random networks\nexhibit transitions between three regimes.

The dynamics of s(t) in such a limit would\nbe diffusive, with a mean translocation time scaling as N^2 in the absence of a\nforce, and proportional to N when a force is applied. We demonstrate that the\nassumption of equilibrium must break down for sufficiently long polymers (more\neasily when forced), and provide lower bounds for the translocation time by\ncomparison to unimpeded motion of the polymer. These lower bounds exceed the\ntime scales calculated on the basis of equilibrium, and point to anomalous\n(sub-diffusive) character of translocation dynamics.

This area law is rigorously proven to hold true in non-critical\nharmonic lattice system of arbitrary spatial dimension, for general\nfinite-ranged harmonic interactions, regions of arbitrary shape and states of\nnonzero temperature. For nearest-neighbor interactions - corresponding to the\nKlein-Gordon case - upper and lower bounds to the degree of entanglement can be\nstated explicitly for arbitrarily shaped regions, generalizing the findings of\n[Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 060503 (2005)]. These higher dimensional analogues of the\nanalysis of block entropies in the one-dimensional case show that under general\nconditions, one can expect an area law for the entanglement in non-critical\nharmonic many-body systems. The proofs make use of methods from entanglement\ntheory, as well as of results on matrix functions of block banded matrices.\nDisordered systems are also considered. We moreover construct a class of\nexamples for which the two-point correlation length diverges, yet still an area\nlaw can be proven to hold. We finally consider the scaling of classical\ncorrelations in a classical harmonic system and relate it to a quantum lattice\nsystem with a modified interaction.

In this paper, we study one-way functions that are hard to invert\neven by a quantum adversary and describe a set of problems which are good such\ncandidates. These problems include Graph Non-Isomorphism, approximate Closest\nLattice Vector and Group Non-Membership. More generally, we show that any hard\ninstance of Circuit Quantum Sampling gives rise to a quantum one-way function.\nBy the work of Aharonov and Ta-Shma, this implies that any language in\nStatistical Zero Knowledge which is hard-on-average for quantum computers,\nleads to a quantum one-way function.
