For\nexample, electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) could be triggered by a\nspontaneously broken, nearly conformal sector.

In particular, we determine the\ntemperature dependence of the screening lengths by fixing the effective\ncoupling constant $Q$ which appears in the transport equation by comparing the\nscreening in the present formalism with exact lattice QCD results. Finally, we\nstudy the dissociation phenomena of heavy quarkonium states such as $c\\bar{c}$\nand $b\\bar{b}$, and determine the dissociation temperatures. Our results are in\ngood agreement with recent lattice results. \n\n"}

In this dissertation, I demonstrate how these theories can be\nprobed by searching for remnants of their effects in the early Universe. In\nparticular I focus on three possible extensions of the Standard Model: the\naddition of massive neutral particles as dark matter (through the use of\nseveral minimal models of dark matter), the addition of charged massive\nparticles (through catalyzed Big Bang Nucleosynthesis), and the existence of\nhigher dimensions (through its effects on BBN and galactic positron\nproduction).

The model predicts a zero-mass pion for zero-mass quarks and a Regge\nspectrum of linear trajectories with the same slope in the leading orbital\nangular momentum $L$ of hadrons and the radial quantum number $N$. Light-Front\nHolography maps the amplitudes which are functions of the fifth dimension\nvariable $z$ of anti-de Sitter space to a corresponding hadron theory quantized\non the light front. The resulting Lorentz-invariant relativistic light-front\nwave equations are functions of an invariant impact variable $\\zeta$ which\nmeasures the separation of the quark and gluonic constituents within the hadron\nat equal light-front time. The result is a semi-classical frame-independent\nfirst approximation to the spectra and light-front wavefunctions of meson and\nbaryon light-quark bound states, which in turn predict the behavior of the pion\nand nucleon form factors.

Second, we explore the prospects for\ndetecting the direct production of third generation squarks in models with an\ninverted squark mass hierarchy. This is signalled by $b$-jets + $\\eslt$ events\nharder than in the Standard Model, but softer than those from the production of\ngluinos and heavier squarks.

Treating\nthe Universe as a dynamical system it is natural to assume that it is\nnon-linear: indeed, linearity is nothing more than approximation, while\nnon-linearity represents the generic case. It is evident that future models of\nthe Universe must take into account different aspects of its evolution. As soon\nas the scale factor is the only dynamical variable, the quantities which\ndetermine its time dependence must be essentially present in all aspects of the\nUniverse' evolution. Basic characteristics of the cosmological evolution, both\nstatic and dynamical, can be expressed in terms of the parameters ${{H}_{0}}$\nand ${{q}_{0}}$. The very parameters (and higher time derivatives of the scale\nfactor) enable us to construct model-independent kinematics of the cosmological\nexpansion.\n  Time dependence of the scale factor reflects main events in history of the\nUniverse. Moreover it is the deceleration parameter who dictates the expansion\nrate of the Hubble sphere and determines the dynamics of the observable galaxy\nnumber variation: depending on the sign of the deceleration parameter this\nnumber either grows (in the case of decelerated expansion), or we are going to\nstay absolutely alone in the cosmos (if the expansion is accelerated).\n  The intended purpose of the report is reflected in its title --- \"Cosmology\nin terms of the deceleration parameter\".

However, such theories can also admit of\nenergy spectra in which energies come in complex conjugate pairs, and can even\nadmit of Hamiltonians that cannot be diagonalized at all. Hermiticity is just a\nparticular realization of $PT$ symmetry, with $PT$ symmetry being the more\ngeneral. These $PT$ theories are themselves part of an even broader class of\ntheories, theories that can be characterized by possessing some general\nantilinear symmetry, as that requirement alone is a both necessary and\nsufficient condition for the time-independent evolution of scalar products,\nwith all the different realizations of the $PT$ symmetry program then being\nobtained. Use of complex Lorentz invariance allows us to show that the\nantilinear symmetry is uniquely specified to be $CPT$, with the $CPT$ theorem\nthus being extended to the non-Hermitian case. For theories that are separately\ncharge conjugation invariant, the results of the $PT$-symmetry program then\nfollow.

This may determine the universality class of the chiral\nphase transition. Since the physics near the chiral phase transition is\nessentially non-perturbative, we employ first principles lattice techniques to\naddress this issue. We use overlap fermions, which have exact chiral symmetry\non the lattice, to probe the anomalous U(1) symmetry violation of 2+1 flavor\ndynamical QCD configurations with domain wall fermions. The latter also\noptimally preserves chiral and flavor symmetries on the lattice, since it is\nknown that the remnant chiral symmetry of the light quarks influences the\nscaling of the chiral condensate in the crossover transition region.

This modification of the collinear factorization formula goes\nbeyond the leading power and thus a natural question arises if such cutoff can\nbe extracted from a formalism which takes into account power corrections. In\nthis work, we consider the High Energy Factorization (HEF) valid at small $x$\nand a new model, based on a similar principle to HEF, which in addition has a\nlimit respecting the Dokshitzer-Dyakonov-Troyan formula for the dijet momentum\ndisbalance spectrum. Minijet cross section and its suppression is then analyzed\nin two ways. First, we study minijets directly in the low-$p_T$ region, and\ndemonstrate that higher twist corrections do generate suppression of the\ninclusive jet production cross section though these effects are not leading to\nthe increase of the cutoff with incident energy. Second, we consider hard\ninclusive dijet production where Multi Parton Interactions (MPIs) with minijets\nproduce power corrections. We introduce an observable constructed from\ndifferential cross section in the ratio $\\tau$ of dijet disbalance to the\naverage dijet $p_T$ and demonstrate that the $\\tau>1$ region is sensitive to\nthe cutoff $p_{T0}$ in the MPI minijet models.

The\nreason is twofold: classically, they provide a tracking solution leading to an\nalmost DeSitter space starting from very generic initial conditions in the deep\nradiation era. The second reason is the standard lore that Galileons are\nquantum mechanically stable. The latter property is certainly true in flat\nspace-time, thanks to the non-renormalization theorems of galilean coupling\nconstants. However, in a cosmological background, we show that quantum effects\nmight dominate the classical trajectory. Assuming the radiation era to last at\nleast up to the electroweak phase transition, the trajectory with initial\nconditions sitting on the tracker is ruled out. On the other hand, it is always\npossible to find a sub-space of initial conditions such that the dark energy\nsolution approaches stably the tracker at late times. Fixing the value of\ninitial conditions that best fit current data, and assuming that the galileon\neffective theory is valid up to the beginning of the radiation epoch, we found\nthat the reheating temperature of the universe cannot be larger than $10^8 \\\n{\\rm GeV}$.

We construct the Floquet charts to find regions of parameter\nspace in which particle production is efficient for both the adiabatic and\nisocurvature modes, and analyze the resonance structure using analytic and\nsemi-analytic techniques. Particle production in the adiabatic direction is\ncharacterized by the existence of an asymptotic scaling solution at large\nvalues of the nonminimal couplings, $\\xi_I \\gg 1$, in which the dominant\ninstability band arises in the long-wavelength limit, for comoving wavenumbers\n$k \\rightarrow 0$. However, the large-$\\xi_I$ regime is not reached until\n$\\xi_I \\geq {\\cal O} (100)$. In the intermediate regime, with $\\xi_I \\sim {\\cal\nO}(1 - 10)$, the resonance structure depends strongly on wavenumber and\ncouplings.

A common wisdom for\nthe resolution of these difficulties lies on the coupled channel effects which\nwill distort the quark model calculations. In this work, we focus on the near\nmass degeneracy of scalar charmed mesons, $D_{s0}^*$ and $D_0^{*0}$, and its\nimplications. Within the framework of heavy meson chiral perturbation theory,\nwe show that near degeneracy can be qualitatively understood as a consequence\nof self-energy effects due to strong coupled channels. Quantitatively, the\ncloseness of $D_{s0}^*$ and $D_0^{*0}$ masses can be implemented by adjusting\ntwo relevant strong couplings and the renormalization scale appearing in the\nloop diagram. Then this in turn implies the mass similarity of $B_{s0}^*$ and\n$B_0^{*0}$ mesons. The $P_0^* P'_1$ interaction with the Goldstone boson is\ncrucial for understanding the phenomenon of near degeneracy. Based on heavy\nquark symmetry in conjunction with corrections from QCD and $1/m_Q$ effects, we\nobtain the masses of $B^*_{(s)0}$ and $B'_{(s)1}$ mesons, for example,\n$M_{B_{s0}^*}= (5715\\pm1)\\,{\\rm MeV}+\\delta\\Delta_S$,\n$M_{B'_{s1}}=(5763\\pm1)\\,{\\rm MeV}+\\delta\\Delta_S$ with $\\delta\\Delta_S$ being\n$1/m_Q$ corrections.

If\nthis is the case, there is the possibility that there might be three body bound\nstates with two charmed mesons and a charmed antimeson.

The numeric\nestimation of the latter is only possible when the parameters of a $5D$ dual\nmodel are previously determined from consistency with other physical aspects,\nstandardly, providing a description of the QCD resonances.

An ancillary dataset that will become accessible with the great\nleaps in sensitivity of CMB experiments is the polarized Sunyaev Zel'dovich\n(pSZ) effect, small-scale CMB polarization anisotropies induced by scattering\nfrom free electrons in the post-reionization Universe. The cross correlation of\nthe pSZ effect with galaxy surveys, a technique known as pSZ tomography, can be\nused to reconstruct the remote quadrupole field: the CMB quadrupole observed\nfrom different locations in the Universe. Primordial gravitational waves leave\na distinct imprint on the remote quadrupole field, making pSZ tomography a\npotential new method to characterize their properties. Building on previous\nwork, we explore the utility of the full set of correlations between the\nprimary CMB and the reconstructed remote quadrupole field to both provide\nexclusion limits on the amplitude of primordial gravitational waves, as well as\nto provide constraints on several phenomenological models of the tensor sector:\naxion gauge field inflation, general models with chiral tensors, and models\nwith modified late-time decay of tensors.

In order\nto have a satisfactory model of dark energy, the quintessence field value today\nshould be as insensible to the initial conditions as possible. Usually, only\nthe dependence on the initial conditions specified at the end of inflation or,\nequivalently, at the beginning of the radiation dominated era, is considered.\nProvided the quintessence field is initially within a large but, crucially,\nfinite interval, its present value becomes independent of the initial value it\nstarted from. The question as to whether inflation naturally drives the\nquintessence field to the above-mentioned interval is addressed. Since the\nquantum effects turn out to be important, the formalism of stochastic inflation\nis used in order to calculate the evolution of the quintessence field.\nMoreover, the quantum effects originating from the inflaton field are also\ntaken into account and are proved to be sub-dominant in most cases. Finally,\nthe requirement that the quintessence field is on tracks today is shown to\nimply quite tight constraints on the initial values of the quintessence and\ninflaton fields at the beginning of inflation. In particular, the initial value\nof the inflaton field cannot be too large which indicates that the\nquintessential scenario seems to be compatible with inflation only if the total\nnumber of e-folds is quite small. \n\n"}

We call this\nscenario the LXCDM model. One possibility for X would be a scalar field, but it\nis not the only one. The overall equation of state (EOS) of the LXCDM model can\neffectively appear as quintessence or phantom energy depending on the mixture\nof the two components. Both the dynamics of Lambda and of X could be linked to\nhigh energy effects near the Planck scale. In the case of Lambda it may be\nrelated to the running of this parameter under quantum effects, whereas X might\nbe identified with some fundamental field (say, a dilaton) left over as a\nlow-energy ``relic'' by e.g. string theory.

All the existing evidence is compatible with\nSpontaneous Symmetry Breaking but dictates a trivially free shifted field that\nbecomes controlled by a quadratic hamiltonian in the continuum limit.

Moreover, the usual naive assumption that the\nHiggs mass-squared $m^2_h$ is proportional to its ``renormalized''\nself-coupling $\\lambda_R$ is not valid outside perturbation theory: the\nappropriate continuum limit has $m_h$ finite and vanishing $\\lambda_R$.

We consider a\nfive dimensional two-branes set up with a bulk scalar field motivated by\nsupergravity. Its low-energy effective theory is derived with a moduli space\napproximation (MSA). The position of the two branes are parametrized by two\nscalar degrees of freedom (moduli). After detuning the brane tensions a\nclassical potential for the moduli is generated. This potential is unstable for\ndS branes and we suggest to consider as a stabilizing contribution the Casimir\nenergy of bulk fields. In particular we add a massive spinor (neutrino) field\nin the bulk and then evaluate the Casimir contribution of the bulk neutrino\nwith the help of zeta function regularization techniques. We construct an\nexplicit form of the 4D neutrino mass as function of the two moduli.

Large values of the NSI couplings are accommodated if the vacuum\noscillation parameters are changed from their standard values. Short and medium\nbaseline neutrino beams can break this degeneracy by measuring the true vacuum\noscillation parameters with the muon neutrino disappearance mode, for which the\nmatter effects are negligible or subdominant. These experiments can also search\nfor the nu_e-nu_tau flavor changing effects directly, by looking for\nnu_mu->nu_e conversion caused by the intervening matter. We discuss both of\nthese methods for the case of MINOS. We find that, while the present MINOS data\non nu_mu disappearance induce only minor changes on the constraints on the NSI\nparameters, the situation will improve markedly with the planned increase of\nthe statistics by an order of magnitude. In that case, the precision will be\nenough to distinguish certain presently allowed NSI scenarios from the no-NSI\ncase.
