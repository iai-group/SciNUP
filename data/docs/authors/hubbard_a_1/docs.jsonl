Cluster\n  Global Properties Abstract: We have selected a sample of 88 nearby (z<0.1) galaxy clusters from the\nSDSS-DR4 with redshift information for the cluster members. We have derived\nglobal properties for each cluster, such as their mean recessional velocity,\nvelocity dispersion, and virial radii. Cluster galaxies have been grouped in\ntwo families according to their $u-r$ colours. The total sample consists of\n10865 galaxies. As expected, the highest fraction of galaxies (62%) turned to\nbe early-type (red) ones, being located at smaller distances from the cluster\ncentre and showing lower velocity dispersions than late-type (blue) ones. The\nbrightest cluster galaxies are located in the innermost regions and show the\nsmallest velocity dispersions. Early-type galaxies also show constant velocity\ndispersion profiles inside the virial radius and a mild decline in the\noutermost regions. In contrast, late-type galaxies show always decreasing\nvelocity dispersions profiles. No correlation has been found between the\nfraction of blue galaxies and cluster global properties, such as cluster\nvelocity dispersion and galaxy concentration. In contrast, we found correlation\nbetween the X-ray luminosity and the fraction of blue galaxies. These results\nindicate that early- and late-type galaxies may have had different evolution.\nThus, blue galaxies are located in more anisotropic and radial orbits than\nearly-type ones. Their star formation seems to be independent of the cluster\nglobal properties in low mass clusters, but not for the most massive ones.\nThese observational results suggest that the global environment could be\nimportant for driving the evolution of galaxies in the most massive cluster\n($\\sigma > 800$ km s$^{-1}$). However, the local environment could play a key\nrole in galaxy evolution for low mass clusters. \n\n"}

In particular, they may be\nimportant in the collapsar scenario for gamma-ray bursts (GRB), where the\ncentral engine is a hyper-accreting black hole or a millisecond magnetar. The\npresent paper is focussed on the magnetar scenario, with a specific emphasis on\nthe interaction of the magnetar magnetosphere with the infalling stellar\nenvelope. First, the ``Pulsar-in-a-Cavity'' problem is introduced as a paradigm\nfor a magnetar inside a collapsing star. The basic set-up of this fundamental\nplasma-physics problem is described, outlining its main features, and simple\nestimates are derived for the evolution of the magnetic field. In the context\nof a collapsing star, it is proposed that, at first, the ram pressure of the\ninfalling plasma acts to confine the magnetosphere, enabling a gradual build-up\nof the magnetic pressure. At some point, the growing magnetic pressure\novertakes the (decreasing) ram pressure of the gas, resulting in a\nmagnetically-driven explosion. The explosion should be highly anisotropic, as\nthe hoop-stress of the toroidal field, confined by the surrounding stellar\nmatter, collimates the magnetically-dominated outflow into two beamed\nmagnetic-tower jets. This creates a clean narrow channel for the escape of\nenergy from the central engine through the star, as required for GRBs. In\naddition, the delayed onset of the collimated-explosion phase can explain the\nproduction of large quantities of Nickel-56, as suggested by the GRB-Supernova\nconnection.

A much more significant difference is the fractional\npolarization which is very high for high Edot pulsars and low for low Edot\npulsars. The Edot at the transition is very similar to the death line predicted\nfor curvature radiation. This suggests a possible link between high energy and\nradio emission in pulsars and could imply that gamma-ray efficiency is\ncorrelated with the degree of linear polarization in the radio band. The degree\nof circular polarization is in general higher in the second component of\ndoubles, which is possibly caused by the effect of co-rotation on the curvature\nof the field lines in the inertial observer frame.\n  The most direct link between the high energy emission and the radio emission\ncould be the sub-group of pulsars which we call the energetic wide beam\npulsars. These young pulsars have very wide profiles with steep edges and are\nlikely to be emitted from a single magnetic pole.

Cloud formation is an old-fashioned but still\noutstanding problem for the Earth atmosphere, and it has turned into a\nchallenge for the modelling of brown dwarf and exo-planetary atmospheres.

Abstract: Red halos are faint, extended and extremely red structures that have been\nreported around various types of galaxies since the mid-1990s. The colours of\nthese halos are too red to be reconciled with any hitherto known type of\nstellar population, and instead indicative of a very bottom-heavy stellar\ninitial mass function (IMF). Due to the large mass-to-light ratios of such\nstellar halos, they could contribute substantially to the baryonic masses of\ngalaxies while adding very little to their overall luminosities. The red halos\nof galaxies therefore constitute potential reservoirs for some of the baryons\nstill missing from inventories in the low-redshift Universe. While most studies\nof red halos have focused on disk galaxies, a red excess has also been reported\nin the faint outskirts of blue compact galaxies (BCGs). A bottom-heavy IMF can\nexplain the colours of these structures as well, but due to model degeneracies,\nstellar populations with standard IMFs and abnormally high metallicities have\nalso been demonstrated to fit the data. Here, we show that due to recent\ndevelopments in the field of spectral synthesis, the metallicities required in\nthis alternative scenario may be less extreme than previously thought. This\nsuggests that the red excess seen in the outskirts of BCGs may stem from a\nnormal, intermediate-metallicity host galaxy rather than a red halo of the type\nseen around disk galaxies. The inferred host metallicity does, however, still\nrequire the host to be more metal-rich than the gas in the central starburst of\nBCGs, in contradiction with current simulations of how BCGs form. \n\n"}

However, such studies cannot explain the small\nsemi-major axes (a) of extrasolar planetary systems, if planets are formed, as\nthe standard planet formation theory suggests, beyond the ice line.\n  In this paper, we numerically study the evolution of three-planet systems in\ndissipating gas disks, and constrain the initial conditions that reproduce the\nobserved semi-major axis and eccentricity distributions simultaneously. We\nadopt the initial conditions that are motivated by the standard planet\nformation theory, and self-consistently simulate the disk evolution, and planet\nmigration by using a hybrid N-body and 1D gas disk code. We also take account\nof eccentricity damping, and investigate the effect of saturation of corotation\nresonances on the evolution of planetary systems.

Along with IC 4665, these are\nthe first pre-main sequence clusters for which a detailed abundance\ndetermination has been carried out so far. We analyzed high-resolution, high\nS/N spectra acquired with different instruments (UVES and CASPEC at ESO, and\nthe echelle spectrograph at CTIO), using MOOG and equivalent width\nmeasurements. Along with metallicity ([Fe/H]), we measured NaI, SiI, CaI, TiI\nand TiII, and NiI abundances. Stars cooler than ~5500 show lower CaI, TiI, and\nNaI than warmer stars. By determining TiII abundances, we show that, at least\nfor Ti, this effect is due to NLTE and over-ionization. We find average\nmetallicities [Fe/H] =0$\\pm 0.01$ and [Fe/H]=0.01$\\pm$ 0.02 for IC 2602 and IC\n2391, respectively. All the [X/Fe] ratios show a solar composition; the\naccurate measurements allow us to exclude the presence of star-to-star scatter\namong the members. \n\n"}

However, hyperaccretion disks around\nneutron stars may exist in some GRB formation scenarios. We study the structure\nand neutrino emission of a hyperaccretion disk around a neutron star.

Recently, Rabus and coworkers' analysis of HST observations lead them\nto claim brightening anomalies during transit might be caused by either a\nsecond transiting planet or a cool starspot. Observations of two consecutive\ntransits are presented here from the University of Arizona's 61-inch Kuiper\nTelescope on May 12 and May 15, 2008 UT. A 5.4 +/- 1.7 mmag (0.54 +/- 0.17%)\nbrightening anomaly was detected during the first half of the transit on May 12\nand again in the second half of the transit on May 15th. We conclude that this\nis a tentative detection of a r greater than or equal to 6 earth radii starspot\nrotating on the surface of the star. We suggest that all evidence to date\nsuggest TrES-1 has a spotty surface and there is no need to introduce a second\ntransiting planet in this system to explain these anomalies.

This is consistent with the previously observed P_obs =\n33.2 +22.3 -14.3 day period.

This process, known as turbulent resistivity, has\nbeen suggested and used in several accretion-ejection models and simulations to\nproduce jets. Still, the efficiency of MRI-driven turbulence to transport\nlarge-scale magnetic fields is largely unknown.\n  We investigate this problem both analytically and numerically. We introduce a\nlinear calculation of the MRI in the presence of a spatially inhomogeneous mean\nmagnetic field. We show that, in this configuration, MRI modes lead to an\nefficient magnetic field transport, on the order of the angular momentum\ntransport. We next use fully non linear simulations of MRI turbulence to\ncompute the turbulent resistivity in several magnetic configurations.\n  We find that the turbulent resistivity is on the order of the turbulent\nviscosity in all our simulations, although somewhat lower.

The inconsistency indicates that there is a serious problem in\nthe map making routine of the WMAP team, and it is necessary to reprocess the\nWMAP data.

Assuming that\nsimulations ccurately predict the number of cosmic strings in the universe,\nthis non-detection allows us to place upper limits on the unitless Universal\ncosmic string tension of G mu/c^2 < 2.3 x 10^-6, and cosmic string density of\nOmega_s < 2.1 x 10^-5 at the 95% confidence level (marginalising over the other\nparameter in each case). We find four dubious cosmic string candidates in 318\nsingle filter guest observer images (1.08 square degrees), which we are unable\nto conclusively eliminate with existing data.

If the orientation of the deduced BDF represents the\norientation of the local interstellar magnetic field (LISMF), as indicated by\nbest-fitting a model to the data, the UDF deviating from the BDF orientation\nimplies a significant contribution from the streaming perpendicular to the\nLISMF.

The large amplitude deduced for the UDF\nindicates a large spatial gradient of the GCR density.

We compare the strength of the predominantly unobscured mid-IR\n[NeII]15.5um + [NeIII]12.8um emission lines to the optical H alpha emission\nlines in four samples of galaxies: (i) ordinary star forming galaxies, (ii)\noptically selected dusty galaxies, (iii) ULIRGs, (iv) Seyfert 2 galaxies.

We provide explicit dust\nattenuation corrections, together with errors, for [OII], [OIII] and H alpha.\nThe best-fit average attenuation curve is slightly greyer than the Milky-Way\nextinction law, indicating either that external galaxies have slightly\ndifferent typical dust properties to the Milky Way, or that there is a\nsignificant contribution from scattering.

We have studied its importance on the period, the amplitude of the\nsolar cycle, and also in producing Maunder-like grand minima in these models.\nFirst, we model the periods of the last 23 sunspot cycles by varying the\nmeridional circulation speed. If the dynamo is in a diffusion-dominated regime,\nthen we find that most of the cycle amplitudes also get modeled up to some\nextent when we model the periods. Next, we propose that at the beginning of the\nMaunder minimum the amplitude of meridional circulation dropped to a low value\nand then after a few years it increased again. Several independent studies also\nfavor this assumption. With this assumption, a diffusion-dominated dynamo is\nable to reproduce many important features of the Maunder minimum remarkably\nwell. If the dynamo is in a diffusion-dominated regime, then a slower\nmeridional circulation means that the poloidal field gets more time to diffuse\nduring its transport through the convection zone, making the dynamo weaker.\nThis consequence helps to model both the cycle amplitudes and the Maunder-like\nminima. We, however, fail to reproduce these results if the dynamo is in an\nadvection-dominated regime. \n\n"}

Model and analysis Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is commonly considered as a mechanism of solar\n(eruptive) flares. A deeper study of this scenario reveals, however, a number\nof open issues. Among them is the fundamental question, how the magnetic energy\nis transferred from large, accumulation scales to plasma scales where its\nactual dissipation takes place. In order to investigate this transfer over a\nbroad range of scales we address this question by means of a high-resolution\nMHD simulation. The simulation results indicate that the magnetic-energy\ntransfer to small scales is realized via a cascade of consecutive smaller and\nsmaller flux-ropes (plasmoids), in analogy with the vortex-tube cascade in\n(incompressible) fluid dynamics. Both tearing and (driven) \"fragmenting\ncoalescence\" processes are equally important for the consecutive fragmentation\nof the magnetic field (and associated current density) to smaller elements. At\nthe later stages a dynamic balance between tearing and coalescence processes\nreveals a steady (power-law) scaling typical for cascading processes. It is\nshown that cascading reconnection also addresses other open issues in solar\nflare research such as the duality between the regular large-scale picture of\n(eruptive) flares and the observed signatures of fragmented (chaotic) energy\nrelease, as well as the huge number of accelerated particles. Indeed,\nspontaneous current-layer fragmentation and formation of multiple channelised\ndissipative/acceleration regions embedded in the current layer appears to be\nintrinsic to the cascading process. The multiple small-scale current sheets may\nalso facilitate the acceleration of a large number of particles. The structure,\ndistribution and dynamics of the embedded potential acceleration regions in a\ncurrent layer fragmented by cascading reconnection are studied and discussed. \n\n"}

The argument\nsupporting this expectation is that in some conditions attained in the core of\nthese objects, the typical De Broglie wavelength associated with helium nuclei\nis of the order of the mean distance between neighboring nuclei. In these\nconditions the system should depart from classical behavior showing quantum\neffects. As helium nuclei are bosons, they are expected to condense.\n  In order to explore the possibility of detecting the Bose-Einstein\ncondensation in the evolution of helium white dwarfs we have computed a set of\nmodels for a variety of stellar masses and values of the condensation\ntemperature. We do not perform a detailed treatment of the condensation process\nbut mimic it by suppressing the nuclei contribution to the equation of state by\napplying an adequate function. As the cooling of white dwarfs depends on\naverage properties of the whole stellar interior, this procedure should be\nsuitable for exploring the departure of the cooling process from that predicted\nby the standard treatment.\n  We find that the Bose-Einstein condensation has noticeable, but not dramatic\neffects on the cooling process only for the most massive white dwarfs\ncompatible with a helium dominated interior (\\approx 0.50 M_\\odot) and very low\nluminosities (say, Log(L/L_\\odot) < -4.0).

To study the influence of these\ndust-coated chondrules on the formation of chondrites and possibly\nplanetesimals, we conducted collision experiments between millimeter-sized,\ndust-coated chondrule analogs at velocities of a few cm/s. For 2 and 3 mm\ndiameter chondrule analogs covered by dusty rims of a volume filling factor of\n0.18 and 0.35-0.58, we found sticking velocities of a few cm/s. This velocity\nis higher than the sticking velocity of dust aggregates of the same size. We\ntherefore conclude that chondrules may be an important step towards a deeper\nunderstanding of the collisional growth of larger bodies. Moreover, we analyzed\nthe collision behavior in an ensemble of dust aggregates and non-coated\nchondrule analogs. While neither the dust aggregates nor the solid chondrule\nanalogs show sticking in collisions among their species, we found an enhanced\nsicking efficiency in collisions between the two constituents, which leads us\nto the conjecture that chondrules might act as \"catalyzers\" for the growth of\nlarger bodies in the young Solar System. \n\n"}

These activity signatures are interpreted as being\ncaused by coupling of an ionised atmosphere to the stellar magnetic field. What\nremains a puzzle, however, is the mechanism by which such a cool atmosphere can\nproduce the necessary level of ionisation. At these low temperatures, thermal\ngas processes are insufficient, but the formation of clouds sets in. Cloud\nparticles can act as seeds for electron avalanches in streamers that ionise the\nambient gas, and can lead to lightning and indirectly to magnetic field\ncoupling, a combination of processes also expected for protoplanetary disks.\nHowever, the precondition is that the cloud particles are charged.\n  We use results from Drift-Phoenix model atmospheres to investigate\ncollisional processes. We show that ionisation by turbulence-induced dust-dust\ncollisions is the most efficient kinetic process. Dust-dust collisions alone\nare not sufficient to improve the magnetic coupling of the atmosphere inside\nthe cloud layers, but the charges supplied either on grains or within the gas\nphase as separated electrons can trigger secondary non-linear processes. Cosmic\nrays are likely to increase the global level of ionisation, but their influence\ndecreases if a strong, large scale magnetic field is present as on Brown\nDwarfs.\n  We suggest that although thermal gas ionisation declines in objects across\nthe fully-convective boundary, dust charging by collisional processes can play\nan important role in the lowest mass objects. The onset of atmospheric dust may\ntherefore correlate with the anomalous X-ray and radio emission in atmospheres\nthat are cool, but charged more than expected by pure thermal ionisation. \n\n"}

We study the impact of this effect on\nthe star formation history of galaxies. We incorporate metallicity-dependent\nstar formation and metal enrichment in a simple model that follows the\nevolution of a halo main progenitor. Our model shows that including the effect\nof metallicity leads to suppression of star formation at redshift z>2 in dark\nhalos with masses <~ 10^11 Msun, with the suppression becoming near total for\nhalos below ~10^9.5-10 Msun. We find that at high redshift the SFR cannot catch\nup with the gas inflow rate (IR), because the SFR is limited by the free-fall\ntime, and because it is suppressed further by a lack of metals. As a result, in\neach galaxy the SFR is growing in time faster than the IR, and the integrated\ncosmic SFR density is rising with time. The suppressed in situ SFR at high z\nmakes the growth of stellar mass dominated by ex situ SFR which implies that\nthe specific SFR (sSFR) remains constant with time. The intensely accreted gas\nat high z is accumulating as an atomic gas reservoir. This provides additional\nfuel for star formation in 10^10 - 10^12 Msun halos at z ~ 1-3, which allows\nthe SFR to exceed the instantaneous IR, and may enable an even higher outflow\nrate. At z<1, following the natural decline in IR with time due to the\nuniversal expansion, the SFR and sSFR are expected to drop. We specify the\nexpected dependence of sSFR and metallicity on stellar mass and redshift. At a\ngiven z, and below a critical mass, these relations are predicted to be flat\nand rising respectively.

As such the scattering process can be considered as\na series of three body problems during each of which the Tisserand parameter\nwith respect to the relevant planet is conserved. This constrains the orbital\nparameter space into which a particle can be scattered. Such arguments have\npreviously been applied to the process by which comets are scattered to the\ninner Solar System from the Kuiper belt. Our analysis generalises this for an\narbitrary planetary system. For particles scattered from an outer belt directly\nalong a chain of planets, based on the initial value of the Tisserand\nparameter, we find that it is possible to (i) determine which planets can eject\nthe particles from the system, (ii) define a minimum stellar distance to which\nparticles can be scattered, and (iii) constrain range of particle inclinations\n(and hence the disc height) at different distances.

Observed differences in\ntemperatures, outflow speeds, and velocity distribution anisotropies are useful\nconstraints on proposed explanations for how the plasma is heated and\naccelerated. This paper presents new predictions of the rates of collisionless\nheating for each particle species, in which the energy input is assumed to come\nfrom magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. We first created an empirical\ndescription of the radial evolution of Alfven, fast-mode, and slow-mode MHD\nwaves. This model provides the total wave power in each mode as a function of\ndistance along an expanding flux tube in the high-speed solar wind. Next we\nsolved a set of cascade advection-diffusion equations that give the time-steady\nwavenumber spectra at each distance. An approximate term for nonlinear coupling\nbetween the Alfven and fast-mode fluctuations is included. For reasonable\nchoices of the parameters, our model contains enough energy transfer from the\nfast mode to the Alfven mode to excite the high-frequency ion cyclotron\nresonance.

Overall, the space of solutions can\nbe split into three distinct classes for which the surface deformation and the\nquadrupole distortion are either prolate and prolate, oblate and prolate, or\noblate and oblate, respectively. We also derive a simple formula expressing the\nrelativistic distortion coefficients, which allows one to compute the surface\ndeformation and the quadrupole distortion up to significant levels of rotation\nand magnetization, essentially covering all known magnetars. Such a formula\nreplaces Newtonian equivalent expressions that overestimate the magnetic\nquadrupole distortion by about a factor of 6 and are inadequate for strongly\nrelativistic objects like neutron stars. \n\n"}

The proposed function provides an\nextraordinarily accurate description of the density PDFs in simulations with\nMach numbers ~0.1-15 and dispersion in log(rho) from ~0.01-4 dex. Compared to a\nlognormal or lognormal-skew-kurtosis model, the fits are improved by orders of\nmagnitude in the wings of the distribution (with fewer free parameters). This\nis true in simulations using distinct numerical methods, including or excluding\nmagnetic fields. Deviations from lognormality are represented by a parameter T\nthat increases with the compressive Mach number. The proposed distribution can\nbe derived from intermittent cascade models of the longitudinal (compressive)\nvelocity differences, which should be directly related to density fluctuations,\nand we provide a simple interpretation of the density PDF as the product of a\ncontinuous-time relaxation process. As such the parameter T is consistent with\nthe same parameter needed to explain the (intermittent) velocity structure\nfunctions; its behavior is consistent with turbulence becoming more\nintermittent as it becomes more dominated by strong shocks.

By analyzing strictly classically (and in two different gauges to\nensure consistency) the density evolution of the smoothest possible\npre-inflationary component -- thermal radiation -- it is found that the O(1)\nstatistical fluctuations on the thermal wavelength scale present formidable\nobstacles to the linear theory of amplitude growth by the end of inflation.\nSince this wavelength scale exited the horizon at an early stage of inflation,\nit severely limits the number of e-folds of perturbative inflation.

Transit observations of the super-Earth GJ 1214b\nrule out a cloud-free H2-dominated atmosphere, but are not able to determine\nwhether the lack of deep spectral features is due to high-altitude clouds or\nthe presence of a high mean molecular mass atmosphere. Here, we demonstrate\nthat one can unambiguously distinguish between cloudy mini-Neptunes and\nvolatile-dominated worlds based on the differences in the wing steepness and\nrelative depths of water absorption features in moderate-resolution NIR\ntransmission spectra (R~100). In a numerical retrieval study, we show for GJ\n1214b that an unambiguous distinction between a cloudy H2-dominated atmosphere\nand cloud-free H2 atmosphere will be possible if the uncertainties in the\nspectral transit depth measurements can be reduced by a factor of ~3 compared\nto the published HST WFC3 and VLT transit observations.

In this compact\nreview we present some clarifications, corrections and further developments of\nthe approach, and provide a brief account of results previously discussed but\nnot reported in the literature. The cross symmetry compound nucleus $S$-matrix\ncorrelations are obtained (i) starting from the unitary $S$-matrix\nrepresentation, (ii) by explicitly taking into account a process of energy\nequilibration, and (iii) without taking the thermodynamic limit of an infinite\nnumber of particles in the thermalized system. It is conjectured that the long\nphase memory is due to the exponentially small total spin off-diagonal\nresonance intensity correlations. This manifestly implies that the strong\nangular asymmetry intimately relates to extremely small deviations of the\neigenfunction distribution from Gaussian law. The spin diagonal resonance\nintensity correlations determine a new time/energy scale for a validity of\nrandom matrix theory.

This feature is interpreted in terms of a\nrelatively young dynamical age in the framework of the \"dynamical clock\"\nconcept proposed by Ferraro et al. (2012). The estimated fraction of binaries\nis 6-7% in the central region (r<90\") and slightly lower (5.5%) in the\noutskirts, at r>200\". Quite interestingly, the comparison with the results of\nMilone et al. (2012) suggests that also binary systems may display a bimodal\nradial distribution, with the position of the minimum consistent with that of\nblue straggler stars. If confirmed, this feature would give additional support\nto the scenario where the radial distribution of objects more massive than the\naverage cluster stars is primarily shaped by the effect of dynamical friction.\nMoreover, this would also be consistent with the idea that the unperturbed\nevolution of primordial binaries could be the dominant BSS formation process in\nlow-density environments. \n\n"}

Gravitational perturbations from the companion are expected\nto excite high planetesimal eccentricities resulting in destruction, rather\nthan growth, of objects with sizes of up to several hundred km in collisions of\nsimilar-size bodies. It was recently suggested that gravity of a massive\naxisymmetric gaseous disk in which planetesimals are embedded drives rapid\nprecession of their orbits, suppressing eccentricity excitation. However, disks\nin binaries are themselves expected to be eccentric, leading to additional\nplanetesimal excitation. Here we develop secular theory of eccentricity\nevolution for planetesimals perturbed by the gravity of an elliptical\nprotoplanetary disk (neglecting gas drag) and the companion. For the first time\nwe derive an expression for the disturbing function due to an eccentric disk,\nwhich can be used for a variety of other astrophysical problems. We obtain\nexplicit analytical solutions for planetesimal eccentricity evolution and\ndelineate four different regimes of dynamical excitation. We show that in\nsystems with massive (>10^{-2}M_Sun) disks, planetesimal eccentricity is\nusually determined by the gravity of the eccentric disk alone, and is\ncomparable to the disk eccentricity. As a result, the latter imposes a lower\nlimit on collisional velocities of solids, making their growth problematic.\nThis fragmentation barrier can be removed if the gaseous disk rapidly precesses\nor if its own self-gravity is efficient at lowering disk eccentricity. \n\n"}

One of the superoutbursts in V1504 Cyg was preceded by a precursor normal\noutburst which was well separated from the main superoutburst. The superhump\nfirst appeared during the descending branch of the precursor normal outburst\nand it continued into quiescence (the deep dip between the precursor and the\nmain superoutburst), and it began to grow in amplitude with the growth of the\nmain superoutburst after quiescence ended.

More precisely, it is of fundamental interest to understand\nhow the storage, manipulation, and transmission of information utilizing\nquantum systems are influenced by the fact that these processes take place in a\nrelativistic spacetime. In particular, many studies in RQI have been focused on\nthe effects of non-uniform motion on entanglement, the main resource of quantum\ninformation protocols. Early investigations in this direction were performed in\nhighly idealized settings that prompted questions as to the practical\naccessibility of these results. To overcome these limitations it is necessary\nto consider quantum systems that are in principle accessible to localized\nobservers. In this thesis we present such a model, the rigid relativistic\ncavity, and its extensions, focusing on the effects of motion on entanglement\nand applications such as quantum teleportation. We study cavities in (1+1)\ndimensions undergoing non-uniform motion, consisting of segments of uniform\nacceleration and inertial motion of arbitrary duration that allow the involved\nvelocities to become relativistic. The transitions between segments can be\nsharp or smooth and higher dimensions can be incorporated. The primary focus\nlies in the Bogoliubov transformations of the quantum fields, real scalar\nfields or Dirac fields, confined to the cavities. The Bogoliubov\ntransformations change the particle content and the occupation of the energy\nlevels of the cavity. We show how these effects generate entanglement between\nthe modes of the quantum fields inside a single cavity for various initial\nstates.

In spite of the diversity of the magnetic\nfield topologies among the stars in our sample, we find that stellar wind\nflowing near the (rotational) equatorial plane carries most of the stellar\nangular momentum, but there is no preferred colatitude contributing to mass\nloss, as the mass flux is maximum at different colatitudes for different stars.\nWe find that more non-axisymmetric magnetic fields result in more asymmetric\nmass fluxes and wind total pressures $p_{\\rm tot}$ (defined as the sum of\nthermal, magnetic and ram pressures). Because planetary magnetospheric sizes\nare set by pressure equilibrium between the planet's magnetic field and $p_{\\rm\ntot}$, variations of up to a factor of $3$ in $p_{\\rm tot}$ (as found in the\ncase of a planet orbiting at several stellar radii away from the star) lead to\nvariations in magnetospheric radii of about 20 percent along the planetary\norbital path.

Most of the transiting planets\nare smaller than 3X the size of Earth. For 16 planets, the Doppler signal was\nsecurely detected, providing a direct measurement of the planet's mass. For the\nother 26 planets we provide either marginal mass measurements or upper limits\nto their masses and densities; in many cases we can rule out a rocky\ncomposition. We identify 6 planets with densities above 5 g/cc, suggesting a\nmostly rocky interior for them. Indeed, the only planets that are compatible\nwith a purely rocky composition are smaller than ~2 R_earth. Larger planets\nevidently contain a larger fraction of low-density material (H, He, and H2O). \n\n"}

For two lattices\nconnected by a junction, we find that the current and particle number\nfluctuations from the microcanonical approach compare well with the values\npredicted by the Landauer formalism and FCS assuming a binomial distribution.\nHowever, we demonstrate that well-defined reservoirs (i.e., particles in\nFermi-Dirac distributions) are not present for a substantial duration of the\nquasi-steady state. Thus, the Landauer assumption of reservoirs and/or\ninelastic effects is not necessary for establishing a quasi-steady state.\nMaintaining such a state indefinitely requires an infinite system, and in this\nlimit well-defined Fermi-Dirac distributions can occur. A Kubo approach -- in\nthe spirit of the microcanonical picture -- bridges the gap between the two\nformalisms, giving explicit analytical expressions for the formation of the\nsteady state.

Abstract: Giant planets like Jupiter and Saturn feature strong zonal wind patterns on\ntheir surfaces. Although several different mechanisms that may drive these jets\nhave been proposed over the last decades, the origin of the zonal winds is\nstill unclear. Here, we explore the possibility that the interplay of planetary\nrotation with the compression and expansion of the convecting fluid can drive\nmultiple deep zonal jets by a compressional Rhines-type mechanism, as\noriginally proposed by Ingersoll and Pollard (1982). In a certain limit, this\ndeep mechanism is shown to be mathematically analogous to the classical Rhines\nmechanism possibly operating at cloud level. Jets are predicted to occur on a\ncompressional Rhines length $l_R = (2 \\Omega \\langle H_\\rho^{-1} \\rangle\nv_{jet}^{-1} )^{-1/2}$, where $\\Omega$ is the angular velocity, $\\langle\nH_\\rho^{-1} \\rangle$ is the mean inverse density scale height and $v_{jet}$ is\nthe typical jet velocity. Two-dimensional numerical simulations using the\nanelastic approximation reveal that this mechanism robustly generates jets of\nthe predicted width, and that it typically dominates the dynamics in systems\ndeeper than $O(l_R)$. Potential vorticity staircases are observed to form\nspontaneously and are typically accompanied by unstably stratified buoyancy\nstaircases. The mechanism only operates at large rotation rates, exceeding\nthose typically reached in three-dimensional simulations of deep convection in\nspherical shells. Applied to Jupiter and Saturn, the compressional Rhines\nscaling reasonably fits the available observations.

If the source of the viscosity is powered by\naccretion, such as in the case of the magneto-rotational instability, such\ndistant energy sources must lie in the innermost regions of the disk, where\naccretion occurs even at the midplane. We argue here that modulations in this\nenergy supply can alter the accretion rate on dynamical, rather than far longer\nviscous, time scales. This means that both the steady state value of and\nfluctuations in the inner disk's accretion rate, depending on the details of\nthe inner boundary condition and occurring on the inner disk's rapid evolution\ntime, can affect the outer disk. This is particularly interesting because\nobservations have shown that disk accretion is not steady (e.g.~EX Lupi type\nobjects).

The orbital\ninclination of Iapetus to the local Laplace plane is ~8 deg, which is\nunexpected, because the inclination should be ~0 if Iapetus formed from a\ncircumplanetary disk on the Laplace surface. It thus appears that some process\nhas pumped up Iapetus's inclination while leaving its eccentricity near zero\n(e=0.03 at present). Here we examined the possibility that Iapetus's\ninclination was excited during the early solar system instability when\nencounters between Saturn and ice giants occurred. We found that the dynamical\neffects of planetary encounters on Iapetus's orbit sensitively depend on the\ndistance of the few closest encounters. In four out of ten instability cases\nstudied here, the orbital perturbations were too large to be plausible. In one\ncase, Iapetus's orbit was practically unneffected. In the remaining five cases,\nthe perturbations of Iapetus's inclination were adequate to explain its present\nvalue. In three of these cases, however, Iapetus's eccentricity was excited to\n0.1-0.25, and it is not clear whether it could have been damped to its present\nvalue (0.03) by some subsequent process (e.g., tides and dynamical friction\nfrom captured irregular satellites do not seem to be strong enough).

Using different variants of the\ntest-field method, we determine the quenching of the turbulent transport\ncoefficients for the forced Roberts flow, isotropically forced non-helical\nturbulence, and rotating thermal convection. We see significant quenching only\nwhen the mean magnetic field is larger than the equipartition value of the\nturbulence.

Thus showing that ion currents play a significant role in\nout-of-plane magnetic structure generation in physically realistic scenarios.\nSimulations of different system sizes show that the width of the octupolar\nstructure remains the same and has a spacial extent of the order of the ion\ninertial length.

We carry out two- and three-dimensional kinetic\nsimulations to investigate relativistic magnetic reconnection and the\nassociated particle acceleration. The simulations focus on electron-positron\nplasmas starting with a magnetically dominated, force-free current sheet\n($\\sigma \\equiv B^2/(4\\pi n_e m_e c^2) \\gg 1$). For this limit, we demonstrate\nthat relativistic reconnection is highly efficient at accelerating particles\nthrough a first-order Fermi process accomplished by the curvature drift of\nparticles along the electric field induced by the relativistic flows. This\nmechanism gives rise to the formation of hard power-law spectra $f \\propto\n(\\gamma-1)^{-p}$ and approaches $p = 1$ for sufficiently large $\\sigma$ and\nsystem size.

To study the history of gas loss in Ursa Minor, we conducted\nthe first three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of this object, assuming\nthat the gas loss was driven by galactic winds powered only by type II\nsupernovae (SNe II). The initial gas setup and supernova (SN) rates used in our\nsimulations are mainly constrained by the inferred star formation history and\nthe observed velocity dispersion of Ursa Minor. After 3 Gyr of evolution, we\nfound that the gas removal efficiency is higher when the SN rate is increased,\nand also when the initial mean gas density is lowered.

By finding a simpler rectilinear example\nof the instability - a sheared half plane, the minimal ingredients for the\ninstability are identified and the destabilizing/stabilizing effect of\ninflow/outflow boundaries clarified. The instability - christened `boundary\ninflow instability' here - is of critical layer type where this layer is either\nat the inflow wall and the growth rate is $O(\\sqrt{\\eta})$ (as found by Ilin \\&\nMorgulis 2013), or in the interior of the flow and the growth rate is $O(\\eta\n\\log 1/\\eta)$ where $\\eta$ measures the (small) inflow-to-tangential-flow\nratio. The instability is robust to changes in the rotation profile even to\nthose which are very Rayleigh-stable and the addition of further physics such\nas viscosity, 3-dimensionality and compressibility but is sensitive to the\nboundary condition imposed on the tangential velocity field at the inflow\nboundary.

These effects relate to\nthe enhancement or depletion, respectively, in coronal abundance with respect\nto photospheric values of elements with FIP below about 10~eV. They are\ninterpreted in terms of the ponderomotive force due to the propagation and/or\nreflection of magnetohydrodynamic waves in the chromosphere. This acts on\nchromospheric ions, but not neutrals, and so can lead to ion-neutral\nfractionation.\n  A detailed description of the model applied to closed magnetic loops, and to\nopen field regions is given, accounting for the observed difference in solar\nFIP fractionation between the slow and fast wind. It is shown that such a model\ncan also account for the observed depletion of helium in the solar wind. The\nhelium depletion is sensitive to the chromospheric altitude where ion-neutral\nseparation occurs, and the behavior of the helium abundance in the closed\nmagnetic loop strongly suggests that the waves have a coronal origin. This, and\nother similar inferences may be expected to have a strong bearing on theories\nof solar coronal heating.\n  Chromospheric waves originating from below as acoustic waves mode convert,\nmainly to fast mode waves, can also give rise to ion-neutral separation.\nDepending on the geometry of the magnetic field, this can result in FIP or\nInverse FIP effects.

While\nthis sample is composed primarily of neutrinos produced by cosmic ray\ninteractions in the Earth's atmosphere, the highest energy events are\ninconsistent with a hypothesis of solely terrestrial origin at 3.7 sigma\nsignificance.

We show that\nanisotropic alpha particles can drive a parallel fire hose instability\nanalogous to that generated by protons, but that, remarkably, the instability\ncan be triggered also when the parallel plasma beta of alpha particles is below\nunity. The wave activity generated by the alpha anisotropy affects the\nevolution of the more abundant protons, leading to their anisotropic heating.\nWhen both ion species have sufficient parallel anisotropies both of them can\ndrive the instability, and we observe generation of two distinct peaks in the\nspectra of the fluctuations, with longer wavelengths associated to alphas and\nshorter ones to protons. If a non-zero relative drift is present, the unstable\nmodes propagate preferentially in the direction of the drift associated with\nthe unstable species.

This\nyielded a primary (pulsating) star with a mass of 1.73 +/- 0.11 solar mass and\na radius of 2.41 +/- 0.06 solar radii plus a Roche-lobe filling secondary star\nwith a mass of 0.41 +/- 0.03 solar mass and a radius of 4.21 +/- 0.11 solar\nradii. 1SWASP J050634.16-353648.4 is therefore a bright delta Sct pulsator in a\nsemi-detached eclipsing binary with one of the largest pulsation amplitudes of\nany such system known. The pulsation constant indicates that the mode is likely\na first overtone radial pulsation. \n\n"}

The upflows move along\nbright filament threads and their directions are almost parallel to the spine\nof the filament. The upflows initiated from the BPs with opposite polarity\nmagnetic fields have opposite directions. The velocity of the upflows in plane\nof sky is about 5$-$50 km s$^{-1}$.

Previous studies revealed many, but not all\ninteresting properties of this event. Our goal was to add new understanding of\nboth the early and late-time phases of SN 2013df. Our spectral analysis is\nbased on 6 optical spectra obtained with the 9.2m Hobby-Eberly Telescope during\nthe first month after explosion, complemented by a near-infrared spectrum. We\napplied the SYNAPPS spectral synthesis code to constrain the chemical\ncomposition and physical properties of the ejecta. A principal result is the\nidentification of \"high-velocity\" He I lines in the early spectra of SN 2013df,\nmanifest as the blue component of the double-troughed profile at ~5650 A. This\nfinding, together with the lack of clear separation of H and He lines in\nvelocity space, indicates that both H and He features form at the outer\nenvelope during the early phases. We also obtained ground-based BVRI and\ng'r'i'z' photometric data up to +45 days and unfiltered measurements with the\nROTSE-IIIb telescope up to +168 days.

In order to reveal the\nproperties of interstellar dust that causes such peculiar extinction laws, we\nperform the fitting calculations to the measured extinction curves by applying\na two-component dust model composed of graphite and silicate.

We find that the steep extinction curves derived from\nthe one-parameter formula by Cardelli et al.

In weakly ionized gas as in PPDs, magnetic flux is largely\nfrozen in the electron fluid, except when resistivity is large. When the disk\nis largely laminar, we show that the relative drift between the electrons and\nions (the Hall-drift), and the ions and neutral fluids (ambipolar-drift) can\nplay a dominant role on the transport of magnetic flux. Using two-dimensional\nsimulations that incorporate the Hall effect and ambipolar diffusion (AD) with\nprescribed diffusivities, we show that when large-scale poloidal field is\naligned with disk rotation, the Hall effect rapidly drags magnetic flux inward\nat the midplane region, while it slowly pushes flux outward above/below the\nmidplane. This leads to a highly radially elongated field configuration as a\nglobal manifestation of the Hall-shear instability. This field configuration\nfurther promotes rapid outward flux transport by AD at the midplane, leading to\ninstability saturation. In quasi-steady state, magnetic flux is transported\noutward at approximately the same rate at all heights, and the rate is\ncomparable to the Hall-free case. For anti-aligned field polarity, the Hall\neffect consistently transports magnetic flux outward, leading to a largely\nvertical field configuration in the midplane region. The field lines in the\nupper layer first bend radially inward and then outward to launch a disk wind.\nOverall, the net rate of outward flux transport is about twice faster than the\naligned case. In addition, the rate of flux transport increases with increasing\ndisk magnetization. The absolute rate of transport is sensitive to disk\nmicrophysics which remains to be explored in future studies. \n\n"}

The discovered compact systems sometimes\ncontain multiple transiting planets, so that their orbital angular momentum\nvectors are tightly aligned. Since planetary orbits are susceptible to forced\noscillations of their inclination angles, the highly aligned nature of these\nsystems places constraints on possible additional (non-transiting) planets. If\nplanets in the outer regions of these solar systems have sufficiently large\nmass or sufficiently small semi-major axis, they will induce the compact inner\norbits to oscillate in and out of a transiting configuration. This paper\nconsiders the dynamics of the compact systems discovered to host five or more\nplanets. In order to not perturb these systems out of a continually, mutually\ntransiting state, additional planetary companions must generally have\nperiastron $p>10$ AU. Specific constraints are found for each of the 18\nplanetary systems considered, which are obtained by marginalising over other\norbital parameters using three different choices of priors for the companion\nproperties (a uniform prior, a transit-inspired prior, and an non-transiting\ndisk prior). A separate ensemble of numerical experiments shows that these\ncompact systems generally cannot contain Jupiter-analogs without disrupting the\nobserved orbits.

Most of the previous studies have focused on Sweet-Parker current\nsheets, which, however, are unattainable in typical astrophysical systems.\nHere, we derive a general set of scaling laws for the plasmoid instability in\nresistive and visco-resistive current sheets that evolve over time. Our method\nrelies on a principle of least time that enables us to determine the properties\nof the reconnecting current sheet (aspect ratio and elapsed time) and the\nplasmoid instability (growth rate, wavenumber, inner layer width) at the end of\nthe linear phase.

Despite much theoretical/numerical and experimental\nefforts over the last decades, its saturation mechanism and amplitude, which\nsets the angular momentum transport rate, remains not well understood,\nespecially in the limit of high resistivity, or small magnetic Prandtl numbers\ntypical to interiors (dead zones) of protoplanetary disks, liquid cores of\nplanets and liquid metals in laboratory. Using direct numerical simulations, in\nthis paper we investigate the nonlinear development and saturation properties\nof the helical magnetorotational instability (HMRI) -- a relative of the\nstandard MRI -- in a magnetized Taylor-Couette flow at very low magnetic\nPrandtl number (correspondingly at low magnetic Reynolds number) relevant to\nliquid metals. For simplicity, the ratio of azimuthal field to axial field is\nkept fixed. From the linear theory of HMRI, it is known that the Elsasser\nnumber, or interaction parameter determines its growth rate and plays a special\nrole in the dynamics. We show that this parameter is also important in the\nnonlinear problem. By increasing its value, a sudden transition from weakly\nnonlinear, where the system is slightly above the linear stability threshold,\nto strongly nonlinear, or turbulent regime occurs. We calculate the azimuthal\nand axial energy spectra corresponding to these two regimes and show that they\ndiffer qualitatively. Remarkably, the nonlinear state remains in all cases\nnearly axisymmetric suggesting that HMRI turbulence is quasi two-dimensional in\nnature. Although the contribution of non-axisymmetric modes increases\nmoderately with the Elsasser number, their total energy remains much smaller\nthan that of the axisymmetric ones. \n\n"}

Motivated by the\ntransition region in the solar atmosphere the temperature and density ratio of\nthe plasmas is chosen as 100 and 0.01, respectively. For better understanding\nof studied processes we make two types of computations: a) without any\ninteractions among plasma particles (free expansion) and b) with the full\nelectromagnetic interactions. In both the cases we found that the flux of cold\nplasma electrons and protons from colder plasma to hotter one dominates over\nthe flux of hot plasma electrons and protons in the opposite direction. Thus,\nthe plasma in the hotter part of the system becomes colder and denser during\ntime evolution. In the case without any interactions among particles the cold\nplasma electrons and protons freely penetrate into the hot plasma. But, the\ncold plasma electrons are faster than cold plasma protons and therefore they\npenetrate deeper into the hotter part of the system than the protons. Thus, the\ncooling of the electron and proton components of the plasma in the hotter part\nof the system is different.

Synthesizing these results, we estimate that the average\nrest-frame dispersion measure from the neutral medium of a single, intersecting\ngalaxy is DM$^{NM}_{DLA}=0.25$ pc/cm^3. Analysis of AlIII and CII* absorption\nlimits the putative warm ionized medium to contribute\nDM$^{WIM}_{DLA}<20$pc/cm^3. Given the low incidence of DLAs, we find that a\npopulation of FRBs at z=2 will incur DM(z=2)=0.01 pc/cm^3 on average, with a\n99% c.l. upper bound of 0.22 pc/cm^3. Assuming that turbulence of the ISM in\nexternal galaxies is qualitatively similar to our Galaxy, we estimate that the\nangular broadening of an FRB by intersecting galaxies is negligible\n($\\theta<0.1$mas). The temporal broadening is also predicted to be small, $\\tau\n\\approx 0.3$ms for a z=1 galaxy intersecting a z=2 FRB for an observing\nfrequency of $\\nu=1$GHz.

For every direction in space there is a definite\ntime at which the change from shrinking to expanding occurs. A late changing\ntime characterizes those states, which shrink to a delta-strip if boosted in\nthe opposite direction. Using a density result for these late-change states one\nshows that all Dirac and Weyl wave-functions are subjected to Lorentz\ncontraction. The latter is discussed in some detail. - We tackle the question\nwhether a causal system induces a representation of a causal logic and thus\nprovides a localization in proper space-time regions rather than on spacelike\nhyperplanes.

The duration and efficiency of exchange\nbetween the primitive massive atmosphere and the global impact-induced water\nocean likely play a key role in the chemical evolution of the early Titan's\natmosphere. To investigate the atmospheric composition of early Titan for a\nwide range of global (atmosphere + ocean) composition in volatils, we first\ndeveloped a gas-liquid equilibrium model of the NH3-CO2-H2O system, where the\nnon-ideal behavior of both gas and liquid phases, and the speciation of\nvolatiles dissolved in the aqueous phase are taken into account. We show that\nthe relative abundance of CO2 and NH3 determine the composition of Titan's\natmosphere. For CO2/NH3 < 1, CO2 is massively dissolved in the ocean. On the\ncontrary, for CO2/NH3 > 1, CO2 is the main constituent of Titan's primitive\natmosphere while the NH3 atmospheric content is dramatically decreased.

There is also growing evidence that disk winds drive accretion in such\ndisks. We show through 2D (axisymmetric) simulations that rings and gaps\ndevelop naturally in magnetically coupled disk-wind systems on the scale of\ntens of au, where ambipolar diffusion (AD) is the dominant non-ideal MHD\neffect. In simulations where the magnetic field and matter are moderately\ncoupled, the disk remains relatively laminar with the radial electric current\nsteepened by AD into a thin layer near the midplane. The toroidal magnetic\nfield sharply reverses polarity in this layer, generating a large magnetic\ntorque that drives fast accretion, which drags the poloidal field into a highly\npinched radial configuration. The reconnection of this pinched field creates\nmagnetic loops where the net poloidal magnetic flux (and thus the accretion\nrate) is reduced, yielding dense rings. Neighbouring regions with stronger\npoloidal magnetic fields accrete faster, forming gaps. In better magnetically\ncoupled simulations, the so-called `avalanche accretion streams' develop\ncontinuously near the disk surface, rendering the disk-wind system more\nchaotic. Nevertheless, prominent rings and gaps are still produced, at least in\npart, by reconnection, which again enables the segregation of the poloidal\nfield and the disk material similar to the more diffusive disks. However, the\nreconnection is now driven by the non-linear growth of MRI channel flows. The\nformation of rings and gaps in rapidly accreting yet laminar disks has\ninteresting implications for dust settling and trapping, grain growth, and\nplanet formation. \n\n"}

The disk is threaded by a weak, large-scale poloidal magnetic field, and\nthe central star has no strong stellar magnetosphere initially. Our simulation\ninvestigates the structure of the accretion flows from a turbulent accretion\ndisk onto the star. The simulation reveals that fast accretion onto the star at\nhigh latitudes occurs even without a stellar magnetosphere. We find that the\nfailed disk wind becomes the fast, high-latitude accretion as a result of\nangular momentum exchange mediated by magnetic fields well above the disk,\nwhere the Lorentz force that decelerates the rotational motion of gas can be\ncomparable to the centrifugal force. Unlike the classical magnetospheric\naccretion scenario, fast accretion streams are not guided by magnetic fields of\nthe stellar magnetosphere. Nevertheless, the accretion velocity reaches the\nfree-fall velocity at the stellar surface due to the efficient angular momentum\nloss at a distant place from the star.

This\nneglect is unwarranted given that any strong vertical motions associated with\nthese waves could profoundly impact dust dynamics, dust sedimentation, planet\nformation, and the emissivity of the disc surface. In this paper we combine\nlinear calculations and shearing box simulations in order to investigate the\nvertical structure of spiral waves for various polytropic stratifications and\nwave amplitudes.

Although stable mass transfer predicts the formation of\nELM WDs with thick hydrogen (H) envelopes, and hence characterized by dominant\nresidual nuclear burning along the cooling branch, the formation of ELM WDs\nwith thinner H envelopes from unstable mass loss cannot be discarded. We\ncompute new evolutionary sequences for helium (He) core WD stars with thin H\nenvelope with the main aim of assessing the lowest $T_{\\rm eff}$ that could be\nreached by this type of stars.

More specifically, changes in atmospheric\nconditions lead to frequency-dependent changes in the atmospheric transmission\nwhich, in turn, leads to variations in the effective gain and central frequency\nof the instrument's bandpass. Using atmospheric modeling software and ACTPol\nbandpasses, we simulate the expected variations in band gain and central\nfrequency for 20, 40, 90, 150, and 240 GHz bands as a function of precipitable\nwater vapor, observing angle, and ground temperature. Combining these effects\nenables us to set maximum and minimum limits on the expected uncertainties in\nband gain and central frequency over the course of a full observing season. We\nthen introduce the uncertainties to parametric maximum-likelihood component\nseparation methods on simulated CMB maps to forecast foreground removal\nperformance and likelihoods on the tensor-to-scalar ratio r. We conclude that\nto measure a $\\sigma(r=0)$ ~ $10^{-3}$ with a bias on the recovered $r$ under\ncontrol, the limit on the uncertainty in the relative gain and central\nfrequency of the bandpass must be <2% and <1%, respectively. We also comment on\nthe possibility of self-calibrating bandpass uncertainties. \n\n"}

The study is based on the Liouville equation,\nwhich is solved numerically in the adiabatic limit. Although the phonon is\nassumed to be coupled only to the intermediate state, it is coupled to the\nother two states by dipolar system-environment interaction, inducing phonon\ncoupling to the other states which are not directly in contact with the phonon.\nAt zero temperature the STIRAP pulse protocol's efficiency of the transfer\ndecreases exponentially with the electron-phonon coupling, until the coupling\nstrength is strong enough to make the process fully incoherent, in which case\nthe population transfer is $\\frac{1}{3}$ in each level.

However, variations in plasma parameters\nand magnetic field strength in the vicinity of a coronal reconnection site may\nlead to wave reflection and mode conversion. In this paper we investigate the\nreflection and refraction of fast magnetoacoustic waves near a reconnection\nsite. Under a justified assumption of an analytically specified Alfv\\'{e}n\nspeed profile, we derive and solve analytically the full wave equation\ngoverning propagation of fast mode waves in a non-uniform background plasma\nwithout recourse to the small-wavelength approximation.

We\nalso use models of higher mass stars. From the analysis of the distribution of\nstars in the observational planes obtained with IR bands, we find that the\nreddening and distance of IC10 are $E(B-V)=1.85$ mag and $d=0.77$ Mpc,\nrespectively.

Using continuation methods at low Prandtl\nnumber, we find both strong equatorially asymmetric and symmetric polar\nnonlinear rotating waves in a model of thermal convection in thin rotating\nspherical shells with stress-free boundary conditions. For the symmetric waves\nconvection is confined to high latitude in both hemispheres but is only\nrestricted to one hemisphere close to the pole in the case of asymmetric waves.\nThis is in contrast to what is previously known from studies in the field.\nThese periodic flows, in which the pattern is rotating steadily in the\nazimuthal direction, develop a strong axisymmetric component very close to\nonset. Using stability analysis of periodic orbits the regions of stability are\ndetermined and the topology of the stable/unstable oscillatory flows bifurcated\nfrom the branches of rotating waves is described. By means of direct numerical\nsimulations of these oscillatory chaotic flows, we show that these\nthree-dimensional convective polar flows exhibit characteristics, such as force\nbalance or mean physical properties, which are similar to flows occuring in\nplanetary atmospheres.

Theoretical models and general relativistic\nmagnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations indicate that the key jet-making\ningredient is large-scale poloidal magnetic flux. However, its origin is\nuncertain, and it is unknown if it can be generated in situ or dragged inward\nfrom the ambient medium. Here, we use the GPU-accelerated GRMHD code H-AMR to\nstudy global 3D BH accretion at unusually high resolutions more typical of\nlocal shearing box simulations. We demonstrate that turbulence in a\nradially-extended accretion disc can generate large-scale poloidal magnetic\nflux in situ, even when starting from a purely toroidal magnetic field. The\nflux accumulates around the BH till it becomes dynamically-important, leads to\na magnetically arrested disc (MAD), and launches relativistic jets that are\nmore powerful than the accretion flow.

The detection of chromospheric activity cycles in solar-analogue and\ntwin stars, can be used to put in context the solar cycle. However, there is a\nrelatively low percentage of these stars with activity cycles detected. It is\nwell known that the cores of Ca II H&K lines are modulated by stellar activity.\nThe behaviour of Balmer and other optical lines with stellar activity is not\nyet completely understood.\n  Aims. To search for Ca II H&K, Balmer and Fe II line variations modulated by\nthe stellar activity. In particular, we apply a novel strategy to detect\npossible shape variations in the H{\\alpha} line.\n  Methods. We analyse activity signatures in HD 38858 by using HARPS and CASLEO\nspectra obtained between 2003 and 2017. We calculate the Mount Wilson index\n(S$_{MW}$), log($\\mathrm{R}'_\\mathrm{HK}$) and the statistical moments of Ca II\nH&K, Balmer and other optical lines. We search for periodicities by using the\ngeneralized Lomb-Scargle periodogram.\n  Results. We detect a long-term activity cycle of 10.8 yr in Ca II H&K and\nH{\\alpha}, being HD 38858 one of the most similar stars to the Sun for which a\ncycle has been detected. In contrast, this cycle is marginally detected in the\nFe II lines. Also, we detect a noticeable radial velocity variation, which\nseems to be produced by stellar activity.\n  Conclusions. HD 38858 is the second solar-analogue star where we find a clear\nactivity cycle which is replicated by Balmer lines. Spectral indexes based on\nthe shape of H{\\alpha} seems to be more realiable than the fluxes in the same\nline to detect activity variations. On the other hand, the cyclic modulation\ndetected gives place to a radial velocity variation, previously associated to a\nsuper-Earth planet. Finally, due to the similarity of HD 38858 with the Sun, we\nrecommend to continue monitoring this star. \n\n"}

Instead, the analysis is based on the observed correlations that\narise during a repeated interaction with the devices and, in particular, their\nability to violate the so called Bell inequalities.\n  Since the analysis of DI protocols holds irrespectively of the underlying\nphysical device, it implies that any device can be used to execute the\nprotocols: If the apparatus is of poor quality, the users of the protocol will\ndetect it and abort; otherwise, they will accomplish their goal. This strong\nstatement comes at a price-- the analysis of DI protocols is, a priori,\nextremely challenging.\n  The thesis presents an approach that can be taken to simplify the analysis of\nDI information processing protocols. The idea is the following: Instead of\nanalysing the most general device leading to the observed correlations, one\nshould first analyse a significantly simpler device that, in each interaction\nwith the user, behaves in an identical way, independently of all other\ninteractions.

Performing the analysis via a reduction to\nIID leads to simpler proofs and significant quantitive improvements, matching\nthe tight results proven when analysing IID devices. \n\n"}

We present the parameter dependence on redshift and provide useful\nfitting formulae. The amplitudes of the mass functions decrease with z, but,\ncontrary to naive expectation, the comoving density of halos of a fixed\nvelocity ~200 km/s actually increases out to z=5. This is because high-z halos\nare denser, so a fixed velocity corresponds to a smaller mass. The slope of the\nvelocity function at z=0 is as steep as ~ -4, and the mass and velocity\nfunctions of distinct halos steepen with increasing z, while the functions of\nsubhalos do not steepen with $z$, and become even flatter at z>2.

In the magnetar model for the SGRs and AXPs,\nthese currents are maintained by magnetic stresses acting deep inside the star.\nWe construct self-similar, force-free equilibria of the current-carrying\nmagnetosphere with a power-law dependence of magnetic field on radius, B ~\nr^(-2-p), and show that a large-scale twist softens the radial dependence to p\n< 1. The spindown torque acting on the star is thereby increased in comparison\nwith a vacuum dipole. We comment on the strength of the surface magnetic field\nin the SGR and AXP sources, and the implications of this model for the narrow\nmeasured distribution of spin periods. A magnetosphere with a strong twist,\nB_\\phi/B_\\theta = O(1) at the equator, has an optical depth ~ 1 to resonant\ncyclotron scattering, independent of frequency (radius), surface magnetic field\nstrength, or charge/mass ratio of the scattering charge. When electrons and\nions supply the current, the stellar surface is also heated by the impacting\ncharges at a rate comparable to the observed X-ray output of the SGR and AXP\nsources, if B_{dipole} ~ 10^{14} G. Redistribution of the emerging X-ray flux\nat the ion and electron cyclotron resonances will significantly modify the\nemerging pulse profile and, through the Doppler effect, generate a non-thermal\ntail to the X-ray spectrum. The sudden change in the pulse profile of SGR\n1900+14 after the 27 August 1998 giant flare is related to an enhanced optical\ndepth to electron cyclotron scattering, resulting from a sudden twist imparted\nto the external magnetic field. \n\n"}

We propose a\nsolution to these ``cooling flow'' problems wherein energy is supplied to the\nplasma by hadronic cosmic rays (CRs).

Abstract: We have determined the dynamical mass of the most luminous stellar cluster\nknown to date, i.e. object W3 in the merger remnant galaxy NGC 7252. The\ndynamical mass is estimated from the velocity dispersion measured with the\nhigh-resolution spectrograph UVES on VLT. Our result is the astonishingly high\nvelocity dispersion of sigma=45 +- 5 km/s. Combined with the large cluster size\nR_eff=17.5 +-1.8 pc, this translates into a dynamical virial mass for W3 of 8\n+- 2 x 10^7 Msun. This mass is in excellent agreement with the value 7.2 x 10^7\nMsun we previously estimated from the cluster luminosity M_V=-16.2 by means of\nstellar M/L ratios predicted by Simple Stellar Population models (with a\nSalpeter IMF) and confirms the heavy-weight nature of this object. This results\npoints out that the NGC 7252-type of mergers are able to form stellar systems\nwith masses up to ~ 10^8 Msun. We find that W3, when evolved to ~ 10 Gyr, lies\nfar from the typical Milky Way globular clusters, but appears to be also\nseparated from omegaCen in the Milky Way and G1 in M31, the most massive old\nstellar clusters of the Local Group, because it is too extended for a given\nmass, and from dwarf elliptical galaxies because it is much more compact for\nits mass. Instead the aged W3 is amazingly close to the compact objects named\nultracompact dwarf galaxies (UCDGs) found in the Fornax cluster (Hilker et al.\n1999; Drinkwater et al. 2000), and to a miniature version of the compact\nelliptical M32.

The basic\nassumption of the curvaton and inhomogeneous reheating mechanisms is that the\ninitial curvature perturbation due to the inflaton field is negligible.

Abstract: Dynamically cold components are well known to destabilize hotter, even much\nmore massive components. In this paper we studied the dynamical influence of a\ncold dust component on the gaseous phase in the central regions of galactic\ndisks. We performed two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations for flat\nmulti-component disks embedded in a combined static stellar and dark matter\npotential. The pressure-free dust component is coupled to the gas by a drag\nforce depending on their velocity difference.\n  It turned out that the most unstable regions are those with either a low or\nnear to minimum Toomre parameter or with rigid rotation, i.e. the central area.\nIn that regions the dust-free disks become most unstable for high azimuthal\nmodes (m~8), whereas in dusty disks all modes have a similar amplitude\nresulting in a patchy appearance. The structures in the dust have a larger\ncontrast between arm and inter-arm regions than those of the gas. The dust\npeaks are frequently correlated with peaks of the gas distribution, but they do\nnot necessarily coincide with them. Therefore, a large scatter in the\ndust-to-gas ratios is expected. The appearance of the dust is more cellular\n(i.e. sometimes connecting different spiral features), whereas the gas is\norganized in a multi-armed spiral structure.\n  An admixture of 2% dust destabilizes gaseous disks substantially, whereas\ndust-to-gas ratios below 1% have no influence on the evolution of the gaseous\ndisk. For a high dust-to-gas ratio of 10% the instabilities reach a saturation\nlevel already after 30 Myr. \n\n"}

The two components mutually interact via aerodynamic\ndrag, which generates radial drift and triggers unstable modes. The secular\ninstability does not require self-gravity, yet it generates growing particle\ndensity perturbations that could seed planetesimal formation. Growth rates are\nslower than dynamical, but faster than radial drift, timescales. Growth rates,\nlike streaming velocities, are maximized for marginal coupling (stopping times\ncomparable dynamical times). Fastest growth occurs when the solid to gas\ndensity ratio is order unity and feedback is strongest. Curiously, growth is\nstrongly suppressed when the densities are too nearly equal. The relation\nbetween background drift and wave properties is explained by analogy with\nHoward's semicircle theorem.

The neutron-neutron correlation function and the corresponding\nstatic structure factor are calculated from molecular dynamics simulations\ninvolving 40,000 to 100,000 nucleons. The static structure factor describes\ncoherent neutrino scattering which is expected to dominate the neutrino\nopacity. At low momentum transfers the static structure factor is found to be\nsmall because of ion screening. In contrast, at intermediate momentum transfers\nthe static structure factor displays a large peak due to coherent scattering\nfrom all the neutrons in a cluster. This peak moves to higher momentum\ntransfers and decreases in amplitude as the density increases. A large static\nstructure factor at zero momentum transfer, indicative of large density\nfluctuations during a first-order phase transition, may increase the neutrino\nopacity. However, no evidence of such an increase has been found. Therefore, it\nis unlikely that the system undergoes a simple first-order phase transition. It\nis found that corrections to the commonly used single heavy nucleus\napproximation first appear at a density of the order of $10^{13}$ g/cm$^3$ and\nincrease rapidly with increasing density.

We assume that the accretion flow is in\na steady state controlled by the neutrino luminosity and mass accretion rate\nthat are kept constant. We obtain solutions of the steady Euler equations for a\nwide range of neutrino luminosity and mass accretion rate. We employ a\nrealistic EOS and neutrino-heating rates. More importantly, we take into\naccount the effect of convection phenomenologically. For each mass accretion\nrate, we find the critical neutrino luminosity, above which there exists no\nsteady solution. These critical points are supposed to mark the onset of the\nshock revival. As the neutrino luminosity increases for a given mass accretion\nrate, there appears a convectively unstable region at some point before the\ncritical value is reached.

Abstract: We consider solutions with conformal symmetry of the static, spherically\nsymmetric gravitational field equations in the vacuum in the brane world\nscenario. By assuming that the vector field generating the symmetry is\nnon-static, the general solution of the field equations on the brane can be\nobtained in an exact parametric form, with the conformal factor taken as\nparameter. As a physical application of the obtained solutions we consider the\nbehavior of the angular velocity of a test particle moving in a stable circular\norbit. In this case the tangential velocity can be expressed as a function of\nthe conformal factor and some integration constants only. For a specific range\nof the integration constants, the tangential velocity of the test particle\ntends, in the limit of large radial distances, to a constant value. This\nbehavior is specific to the galactic rotation curves, and is explained usually\nby invoking the hypothesis of the dark matter. The limiting value of the\nangular velocity of the test particle can be obtained as a function of the\nbaryonic mass and radius of the galaxy. The behavior of the dark radiation and\ndark pressure terms is also considered in detail, and it is shown that they can\nbe expressed in terms of the rotational velocity of a test particle.

We describe a\npostselection procedure to project the register state onto a subspace of\nmaximally entangled states.

This includes as special cases the AJL algorithm\nfor the Jones polynomial, the partition function of the Potts model for any\nweighted planer graph at any temperature, and many other combinatorial graph\nproperties. In the second part of the paper we prove the quantum universality\nof many of the problems for which we provide an algorithm, thus providing a\nlarge set of new quantum-complete problems. Unfortunately, we do not know that\nthis holds for the Potts model case; this is left as an important open problem.\nThe main progress in this work is in our ability to handle non-unitary\nrepresentations of the Temperley Lieb algebra, both when applying them in the\nalgorithm, and, more importantly, in the proof of universality, when encoding\nquantum circuits using non-unitary operators. To this end we develop many new\ntools, that allow proving density and applying the Solovay Kitaev theorem in\nthe case of non-unitary matrices. We hope that these tools will open up new\npossibilities of using non-unitary reps in other quantum computation contexts. \n\n"}

Abstract: Entanglement bits or ``ebits'' have been proposed as a quantitative measure\nof a fundamental resource in quantum information processing. For such an\ninterpretation to be valid, it is important to show that the same number of\nebits in different forms or concentrations are inter-convertible in the\nasymptotic limit. Here we draw attention to a very important but hitherto\nunnoticed aspect of entanglement manipulation --- the classical communication\ncost. We construct an explicit procedure which demonstrates that for bi-partite\npure states, in the asymptotic limit, entanglement can be concentrated or\ndiluted with vanishing classical communication cost. Entanglement of bi-partite\npure states is thus established as a truly inter-convertible resource. \n\n"}

In order to protect DFSs against these errors it is\nsufficient to employ a recently proposed concatenated DFS-quantum error\ncorrecting code scheme [D.A. Lidar, D. Bacon and K.B. Whaley, Phys. Rev.
