However, a real clarification of these observations was only\nrecently achieved by NA60, measuring dimuons with unprecedented precision in\n158A GeV In-In collisions. The excess mass spectrum in the region M<1 GeV is\nconsistent with a dominant contribution from pi+pi- -> rho -> mu+mu-\nannihilation. The associated rho spectral function shows a strong broadening,\nbut essentially no shift in mass. In the region M>1 GeV, the excess is found to\nbe prompt, not due to enhanced charm production. The inverse slope parameter\nTeff associated with the transverse momentum spectra rises with mass up to the\nrho, followed by a sudden decline above. While the initial rise, coupled to a\nhierarchy in hadron freeze-out, points to radial flow of a hadronic decay\nsource, the decline above signals a transition to a low-flow source, presumably\nof partonic origin. The mass spectra show the steep rise towards low masses\ncharacteristic for Planck-like radiation. The polarization of the excess\nreferred to the Collins Soper frame is found to be isotropic.

It is notable that this implied\nrotation rate is lower than that attributed to the solar radiative zone,\nsuggestive of a slowly rotating solar core. This leads us to hypothesize that\nthere may be an \"inner tachocline\" separating the core from the radiative zone,\nanalogous to the \"outer tachocline\" that separates the radiative zone from the\nconvection zone. The Rieger periodicity (which has a period of about 154 days,\ncorresponding to a frequency of 2.37 year^{-1}) may be attributed to an r-mode\noscillation with spherical-harmonic indices l=3, m=1, located in the outer\ntachocline. This suggests that we may test the hypothesis of a solar influence\non nuclear decay rates by searching BNL and PTB data for evidence of a\n\"Rieger-like\" r-mode oscillation, with l=3, m=1, in the inner tachocline. The\nappropriate search band for such an oscillation is estimated to be 2.00-2.28\nyear^{-1}. We find, in both datasets, strong evidence of a periodicity at 2.11\nyear^{-1}.

To check this conjecture we study the\nimplication of several properties of high momentum component of the nuclear\nwave function on the characteristics of EMC effect. We observe two main reasons\nfor the EMC-SRC correlation: first, the decrease of the contribution from the\nnuclear mean field due to the increase, with A, the fraction of the high\nmomentum component of nuclear wave function. Second, the increase of the medium\nmodification of nucleons in SRC. Our main prediction however is the increase of\nthe proton contribution to the EMC effect for large A asymmetric nuclei.

The\nbeam asymmetry thus provides the simplest observable with a clean separation of\nthe magnetic polarizability from the electric one. Introducing polarizabilities\nin a Lorentz-invariant fashion we compute the higher-order (recoil) effects of\npolarizabilities on beam asymmetry and show that these effects are most\nsuppressed in forward kinematics. With the prospects of precision Compton\nexperiments at the MAMI and HIGS facilities in mind, we argue why the beam\nasymmetry could be the best way to measure the elusive magnetic polarizability\nof the proton. \n\n"}

The data, corresponding to an integrated\nluminosity of approximately 31 inverse nanobarns, were collected during the\n2013 LHC pPb run at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV by the\nCMS experiment.

To understand more deeply the PSS, we focus on\nseveral issues related to the exact conservation and breaking mechanism of the\nPSS in single particle resonances. In particular, we are interested in how the\nenergy and width splittings of PS partners depend on the depth of the scalar\nand vector potentials. We investigate the asymptotic behaviors of radial Dirac\nwave functions. Spherical square well potentials are employed in which the PSS\nbreaking part in the Jost function can be well isolated. By examining the zeros\nof Jost functions corresponding to small components of the radial Dirac wave\nfunctions, general properties of the PSS are analyzed. By examining the Jost\nfunction, the occurrence of intruder orbitals is explained and it is possible\nto trace continuously the PSS partners from the PSS limit to the case with a\nfinite potential depth. The dependence of the PSS in resonances as well as in\nbound states on the potential depth is investigated systematically. We find a\nthreshold effect in the energy splitting and an anomaly in the width splitting\nof pseudospin partners when the depth of the single particle potential varies\nfrom zero to a finite value. The conservation and the breaking of the PSS in\nresonant states and bound states share some similar properties.

This paper explores the correlations among harmonic flow\ncoefficients $v_n$ and their phases $\\Phi_n$, and the rapidity fluctuation of\n$v_n$. The study is carried out usin Pb+Pb events generated by the AMPT model\nwith fixed impact parameter. The overall ellipticity/triangularity of events is\nvaried by selecting on the eccentricities $\\epsilon_n$ or the magnitudes of the\nflow vector $q_n$ for n=2 and 3, respectively. The responses of the $v_n$, the\nevent-plane correlations, and the rapidity fluctuations, to the change in\n$\\epsilon_n$ and $q_n$ are then systematized. Strong positive correlations are\nobserved among all even harmonics $v_2, v_4$, and $v_6$ (all increase with\n$q_2$), between $v_2$ and $v_5$ (both increase with $q_2$) and between $v_3$\nand $v_5$ (both increase with $q_3$), consistent with the effects of nonlinear\ncollective response. In contrast, an anti-correlation is observed between $v_2$\nand $v_3$ similar to that seen between $\\epsilon_2$ and $\\epsilon_3$. These\ncorrelation patterns are found to be independent of whether selecting on $q_n$\nor $\\epsilon_n$, validating the ability of $q_n$ in selecting the initial\ngeometry.

They help address the\nquestion of whether there is evidence for global, flow-like, azimuthal\ncorrelations in the p-Pb system. Comparisons are made to measurements from the\nlarger Pb-Pb system, where such evidence is established. In particular, the\nsecond harmonic two-particle cumulants are found to decrease with multiplicity,\ncharacteristic of a dominance of few-particle correlations in p-Pb collisions.\nHowever, when a $|\\Delta \\eta|$ gap is placed to suppress such correlations,\nthe two-particle cumulants begin to rise at high-multiplicity, indicating the\npresence of global azimuthal correlations. The Pb-Pb values are higher than the\np-Pb values at similar multiplicities. In both systems, the second harmonic\nfour-particle cumulants exhibit a transition from positive to negative values\nwhen the multiplicity increases. The negative values allow for a measurement of\n$v_{2}\\{4\\}$ to be made, which is found to be higher in Pb-Pb collisions at\nsimilar multiplicities.

We find reasonable agreement with\nthe measured $v_2$ in d+Au and $^3$He+Au and $v_3$ in $^3$He+Au for transverse\nmomentum ($p_{T}$) $\\lesssim$ 1 GeV/c, but underestimate these measurements for\nhigher values of \\pt. We predict a pattern of coefficients ($v_{2}$, $v_{3}$)\nfor \\pau, dominated by differences in the number of induced local hot spots\n(i.e. one, two, or three) arising from intrinsic geometry. Additionally, we\nexamine how this substantial azimuthal anisotropy accrues during each\nindividual evolutionary phase of the collision in the AMPT model. The\npossibility of a simultaneous description of RHIC- and LHC-energy data, the\nsuite of different geometries, and high multiplicity p+p data is an exciting\npossibility for understanding the underlying physics in these systems. \n\n"}

Together with new shell-model calculations of the\nelectron-capture strength function of 56Sc, our results strongly reduce\nuncertainties in model calculations of the heating and cooling at the 56Ti\nelectron-capture layer in the outer crust of accreting neutron stars. We found\nthat, in contrast to previous studies, neither strong neutrino cooling nor\nstrong heating occurs in this layer. We conclude that Urca cooling in the outer\ncrusts of accreting neutron stars that exhibit superbursts or high temperature\nsteady-state burning, which are predicted to be rich in A=56 nuclei, is\nconsiderably weaker than predicted. Urca cooling must instead be dominated by\nelectron capture on the small amounts of adjacent odd-A nuclei contained in the\nsuperburst and high temperature steady-state burning ashes. This may explain\nthe absence of strong crust Urca cooling inferred from the observed cooling\nlight curve of the transiently accreting x-ray source MAXI J0556-332. \n\n"}

Such an extreme state of strongly-interacting QCD\n(Quantum Chromo-Dynamics) matter is produced in the laboratory with high-energy\ncollisions of heavy nuclei, where an enhanced production of strange hadrons is\nobserved [2-6].

Recent\nterrestrial experiments constrain both its value and slope at nuclear\nsaturation density, however, its value at higher densities is unknown. Assuming\na Free Fermi-gas (FFG) model for the kinetic symmetry energy, the high-density\nextrapolation depends on a single parameter, the density dependence of the\npotential symmetry energy. The Correlated Fermi-gas (CFG) model improves on the\nFFG model by including the effects of short-range, correlated, high-momentum,\nnucleons in nuclear matter. Using the CFG model for the kinetic symmetry energy\nalong with constraints from terrestrial measurements leads to a much softer\ndensity dependence for the potential symmetry energy. Purpose: Examine the\nability of the FFG and CFG models to describe NS observables that are directly\nsensitive to the symmetry energy at high-density. Specifically, examine the\nability of the CFG model, with its softer density dependence of the potential\nsymmetry energy, to describe a two solar-mass NS. Methods: Using a Bayesian\nanalysis of NS observables we compare the CFG and FFG models and examine the\nresulting parameters in the NS EOS and the density dependence of the potential\nsymmetry energy. Results: Despite the large difference in the density\ndependence of the potential part of the symmetry energy, both models can\ndescribe the NS data and support a two solar-mass NS. The different density\ndependences has only a small effect on the NS EOS. Conclusions: While sensitive\nto the high-density values of the symmetry energy, NS observables alone are not\nenough to distinguish between the CFG and FFG models. This indicates that the\nNS EOS, obtain from Bayesian analysis of NS observables, is robust and is not\nsensitive to the exact nuclear model used for the kinetic symmetry energy. \n\n"}

We point out that the\nperturbative QCD computation of such azimuthal correlations and asymmetries can\nlead to divergent results at fixed perturbative orders. The fixed-order\ndivergences affect basic (and infrared safe) quantities such as the total cross\nsection at fixed (and arbitrary) values of the azimuthal-correlation angle\n$\\varphi$. Examples of processes with fixed-order divergences are heavy-quark\npair production, associated production of vector bosons and jets, dijet and\ndiboson production. A noticeable exception is the production of high-mass\nlepton pairs through the Drell--Yan mechanism of quark-antiquark annihilation.\nHowever, even in the Drell--Yan process, fixed-order divergences arise in the\ncomputation of QED radiative corrections.

BUGS utilises\nthree types of detector to facilitate a high-sensitivity, high-throughput\nradioassay programme to support the development of rare-event search\nexperiments. A Broad Energy Germanium (BEGe) detector delivers sensitivity to\nlow-energy gamma-rays such as those emitted by 210Pb and 234Th. A Small Anode\nGermanium (SAGe) well-type detector is employed for efficient screening of\nsmall samples. Finally, a standard p-type coaxial detector provides fast\nscreening of standard samples. This paper presents the steps used to\ncharacterise the performance of these detectors for a variety of sample\ngeometries, including the corrections applied to account for cascade summing\neffects. For low-density materials, BUGS is able to radio-assay to specific\nactivities down to 3.6 mBq/kg for 234Th and 6.6 mBq/kg for 210Pb both of which\nhave uncovered some significant equilibrium breaks in the 238U chain.

The\ncorrections that lead to deviations from free streaming (and that dominate at\nlate proper time) would provide evidence for the onset of isotropization (and,\npossibly, thermalization) of the produced medium. To find such corrections we\ncalculate the late-time two-point Green function and the energy-momentum tensor\ndue to a single $2 \\to 2$ scattering process involving two classical fields.

Continuum extrapolated\nlattice QCD equations of state have been computed using 2+1 quark flavors\n(up/down and strange) as well as 2+1+1 flavors to investigate the effect of\nthermalized charm quarks on QCD thermodynamics. Lattice results have also\nindicated the presence of new strange resonances that not only contribute to\nthe equation of state of QCD matter but also affect hadronic afterburners used\nto model the later stages of heavy ion collisions. We investigate how these new\ndevelopments obtained from first principles calculations affect multiparticle\ncorrelations in heavy ion collisions. We compare the commonly used equation of\nstate S95n-v1, which was constructed using what are now considered outdated\nlattice results and hadron states, to the current state-of-the-art lattice QCD\nequations of state with 2+1 and 2+1+1 flavors coupled to the most up-to-date\nhadronic resonances and their decays.

The\nscaling parameter $K$ is determined by the quality factor method and is\nparameterized by $a \\langle N_{\\rm{part}}\\rangle^{b}$, where $\\langle\nN_{\\rm{part}}\\rangle$ is the average value of the number of participating\nnucleons, $a$ and $b$ are free parameters, $b$ characterizes the rate at which\n$\\textrm{ln} K$ changes with $\\textrm{ln} \\langle N_{\\rm{part}}\\rangle$. The\nvalues of $b$ for pions and kaons are consistent within uncertainties, while\nthey are smaller than that for protons. In the high $p_{\\rm{T}}$ region, due to\nthe suppression of the spectra, a violation of the proposed scaling is observed\ngoing from central to peripheral collisions. The more peripheral the collisions\nare, the more clearly violated the proposed scaling becomes. In the framework\nof the colour string percolation model, we argue that the pions, kaons and\nprotons originate from the fragmentation of clusters which are formed by\nstrings overlapping and the cluster's fragmentation functions are different for\ndifferent hadrons. The scaling behaviour of the pion, kaon and proton spectra\nin the low $p_{\\rm T}$ region can be simultaneously explained by the colour\nstring percolation model in a qualitative way. \n\n"}

To address this controversy, and to connect the resolution to\nthe underlying physical processes, we build an independent simulation pipeline\nfor neutrino events in liquid argon, combining the public tools GENIE and\nFLUKA. Using this pipeline, we first characterize the channels of\nnon-hermeticity of DUNE, including subthreshold particles, charge\nrecombination, and nuclear breakup. Particular attention is paid to the role of\nneutrons, which are responsible for a large fraction of missing energy in all\nchannels. Next, we determine energy resolution, by quantifying event-to-event\nstochastic fluctuations in missing energy. This is done for several sets of\nassumptions about the reconstruction performance, including those available in\nthe literature. The resulting migration matrices, connecting true and\nreconstructed neutrino energies, are presented. Finally, we quantify the impact\nof different improvements on the experimental performance.

Furthermore, the constituents of this novel system\nare found to undergo a significant level of interaction.

As a function of centrality, the total number of charged\nparticles scales with the number of participating nucleons.

If we assume that the proton was a spectator to the reaction\ntaking place on the neutron in deuterium, the initial state of that neutron can\nbe inferred. This method, known as spectator tagging, can be used to study\nelectron scattering from high-momentum (off-shell) neutrons in deuterium. The\ndata were taken with a 5.765 GeV electron beam on a deuterium target in\nJefferson Laboratory's Hall B, using the CLAS detector. A reduced cross section\nwas extracted for different values of final-state missing mass $W^{*}$,\nbackward proton momentum $\\vec{p}_{s}$ and momentum transfer $Q^{2}$. The data\nare compared to a simple PWIA spectator model. A strong enhancement in the data\nobserved at transverse kinematics is not reproduced by the PWIA model. This\nenhancement can likely be associated with the contribution of final state\ninteractions (FSI) that were not incorporated into the model.

In the longitudinal direction pions seem to exhibit Landau flow.\nThis simple model assumes that all the entropy in the collisions is created the\ninstant the two Lorentz contracted nuclei overlap and that the system then\nexpands adiabatically.

At high temperatures\n(above the critical temperature T_c) we use the sound velocity function\nobtained from the recent lattice simulations of QCD, whereas at low\ntemperatures we use the ideal hadron gas model. At moderate temperatures\ndifferent interpolations between those two results are employed. They are\ncharacterized by different values of the local maximum (at T = 0.4 T_c) and\nlocal minimum (at T=T_c). The extreme values are chosen in such a way that at\nhigh temperature all considered sound-velocity functions yield the entropy\ndensity consistent with the lattice simulations of QCD. We find that the\npresence of a distinct minimum of the sound velocity leads to a very long (~ 20\nfm/c) evolution time of the system. Since such long evolution times are not\ncompatible with the recent estimates based on the HBT interferometry, we\nconclude that the hydrodynamic description becomes adequate if the QCD\ncross-over phase transition renders the smooth temperature variations of the\nsound velocity, with a possible shallow minimum at T_c where the values of\nc_s^2(T) remain well above 0.1. \n\n"}

Here we\nnote that the signature can be greatly enhanced by making suitable cuts in the\ndata. In particular, we consider reducing the data set such that the $k$ pions\nwith lowest $p_T$ are all neutral. We find that, given such cuts, $<R >$ can be\nsubstantially different from 1/3. For example, for a single D$\\chi$C domain\nwithout contamination due to incoherently emitted pions, $<R>$ is 3/5 given the\npion with lowest $p_T$ is neutral, and 5/7 given the two pions with lowest\n$p_T$ are both neutral, etc..
