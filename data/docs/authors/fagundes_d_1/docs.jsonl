This is suggested by recent work on the phenomenology of flux\ncompactified type IIB string theory. The essential features of this scenario\nare that the gaugino masses are of the anomaly-mediated SUSY breaking (AMSB)\nform, while scalar and trilinear soft SUSY breaking terms are highly\nsuppressed. Renormalization group effects yield an allowable sparticle mass\nspectrum, while at the same time avoiding charged LSPs; the latter are common\nin models with negligible soft scalar masses, such as no-scale or gaugino\nmediation models. Since scalar and trilinear soft terms are highly suppressed,\nthe SUSY induced flavor and CP-violating processes are also suppressed. The\nlightest SUSY particle is the neutral wino, while the heaviest is the gluino.\nIn this model, there should be a strong multi-jet +etmiss signal from squark\npair production at the LHC.

A direct consequence is that the transition form factor need not\nnecessarily vanish at large values of the photon virtuality. Moreover, in the\nrange of the BaBar experiment, the Terazawa-West bound is an order of magnitude\nabove the data, thus is of formal rather than practical interest.

The tolerable agreement with Monte Carlos based\non LO DGLAP evolution indicates that there is no qualitative difference between\n`hard' and `soft' interactions; and that a perturbative QCD approach may be\nextended into the soft domain. However, in order to describe the data, these\nMonte Carlos need an additional infrared cutoff k_min with a value k_min ~ 2-3\nGeV which is not small, and which increases with collider energy. Here we\nexplain the physical origin of the large k_min. Using an alternative model\nwhich matches the `soft' high-energy hadron interactions smoothly on to\nperturbative QCD at small x, we demonstrate that this effective cutoff k_min is\nactually due to the strong absorption of low k_t partons. The model embodies\nthe main features of the BFKL approach, including the diffusion in transverse\nmomenta, lnk_t, and an intercept consistent with resummed next-to-leading log\ncorrections. Moreover, the model uses a two-channel eikonal framework, and\nincludes the contributions from the multi-Pomeron exchange diagrams, both\nnon-enhanced and enhanced. The values of a small number of physically-motivated\nparameters are chosen to reproduce the available total, elastic and proton\ndissociation cross section (pre-LHC) data.

When they thermalize, the axions form a Bose-Einstein\ncondensate. Their thermalization occurs in a regime, herein called the\n`condensed regime', where the Boltzmann equation is not valid because the\nenergy dispersion of the particles is smaller than their interaction rate. We\nderive analytical expressions for the thermalization rate of particles in the\ncondensed regime, and check the validity of these expressions by numerical\nsimulation of a toy model.

Despite the\nfact that the shape of the four-point correlators is not fixed by the\nsymmetries of de Sitter, its exact shape can be found in the collapsed limit\nmaking use of the operator product expansion. By employing the fact that\nconformal invariance imposes the two-point cross-correlations of the light\nfields to vanish unless the fields have the same conformal weights, we are able\nto show that the Suyama-Yamaguchi inequality relating the coefficients $f_{\\rm\nNL}$ of the bispectrum in the squeezed limit and $\\tau_{\\rm NL}$ of the\ntrispectrum in the collapsed limit also holds when the light fields are\nintrinsically non-Gaussian.

In this paper we assume that in particular\nkinematical region probed by LHC forward (LHCf) experiment the saturation scale\ncan be considered the hard momentum scale present in the process and calculate\nthe forward neutral pion production at very low-$p_T$ using a perturbative\napproach. We demonstrate that the CGC formalism is able to successfully\ndescribe the LHCf data, which can be considered as a compelling indication of\nthe presence of non-linear QCD effects at LHC energies. \n\n"}

We explore very wide ranges of the\npMSSM parameters but pay particular attention to the higgsino-like neutralino\nat the ~ 1 TeV scale, which has been shown to be a well motivated solution in\nmany constrained supersymmetric models, as well as to a wino-dominated solution\nwith the mass in the range of 2-3 TeV. After summarising the present bounds on\nthe parameter space from direct and indirect detection experiments, we focus on\nprospects for detection of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). To this end, we\nderive a realistic assessment of the sensitivity of CTA to photon fluxes from\ndark matter annihilation by means of a binned likelihood analysis for the\nEinasto and Navarro-Frenk-White halo profiles. We use the most up to date\ninstrument response functions and background simulation model provided by the\nCTA Collaboration. We find that, with 500 hours of observation, under the\nEinasto profile CTA is bound to exclude at the 95% C.L. almost all of the ~ 1\nTeV higgsino region of the pMSSM, effectively closing the window for heavy\nsupersymmetric dark matter in many realistic models. CTA will be able to probe\nthe vast majority of cases corresponding to a spin-independent scattering cross\nsection below the reach of 1-tonne underground detector searches for dark\nmatter, in fact even well below the irreducible neutrino background for direct\ndetection. On the other hand, many points lying beyond the sensitivity of CTA\nwill be within the reach of 1-tonne detectors, and some within collider reach.\nAltogether, CTA will provide a highly sensitive way of searching for dark\nmatter that will be partially overlapping and partially complementary with\n1-tonne detector and collider searches, thus being instrumental to effectively\nexplore the nearly full parameter space of the pMSSM. \n\n"}

The model is invariant under a chiral parity operation,\nwhich can be spontaneously broken by a vev of the scalar field. We have\ncomputed explicitly Wilsonian running of relevant parameters which makes it\npossible to discuss in a consistent manner the issue of fine-tuning and\nstability of the scalar potential.

Since Wilsonian running includes\nautomatically integration out of heavy degrees of freedom, the running differs\nmarkedly from the Gell-Mann-Low version. However, similar behaviour can be\nobserved: scalar mass squared parameter and the quartic coupling can change\nsign from a positive to a negative one due to running which causes spontaneous\nsymmetry breaking or an instability in the renormalizable part of the potential\nfor a given range of scales.

Transverse\nmomentum spectra of baryons from RHIC ($\\sqrt(s)$=62 and 200 GeV) and from LHC\n($\\sqrt(s)$=0.9 and 7 TeV) have been considered. It is seen that the slope of\ndistributions at low $p_T$'s is changing with energy. The QGSM fit of these\nspectra gives the average transverse momenta which behave as $s^{0.06}$ that is\nsimilar to the previously observed behavior of $\\Lambda^0$ hyperon spectra. The\nchange in average transverse momenta that are slowly growing in VHE hadron\ninteractions at CR detectors cannot cause the \"knee\" in measured cosmic ray\nproton spectra. In addition, the available data on heavy quark hadron\nproduction from LHC-b at $\\sqrt{s}$=7 TeV were also studied. The preliminary\ndependence of hadron average transverse momenta on their masses at LHC energy\nis presented. The possible source of cosmic ray antiparticle-to-particle ratios\nthat are growing with energy was analyzed in the framework of QGSM, where the\ngrowing ratios are the result of local leading asymmetry between the production\nspectra of baryons and antibaryons in the kinematical region of proton target\nfragmentation.

We take the above as indications that at some level the small\nquantities are well-approximated by zero. In particular the mixing angles, to a\nzero order, should be either 0 or $\\pi/4$. Accordingly, in this model the\nType-II see-saw dominates and generates the larger atmospheric mass splitting\nand sets $\\theta_{23} = \\pi/4$. The other mixing angles are vanishing as is the\nsolar splitting. We show how the $A4$ assignment for the lepton doublets leads\nto this form. We also specify the $A4$ properties of the right-handed neutrinos\nwhich result in a smaller Type-I see-saw contribution that acts as a\nperturbation and shifts the angles $\\theta_{12}$ and $\\theta_{13}$ into the\ncorrect range and the desired value of $\\Delta m^2_{solar}$ is produced.

The current experimental searches for the\nsecond stop are based on the simplified model approach with the decay modes\n$\\tilde{t}_2 \\to \\tilde{t}_1 Z$ and $\\tilde{t}_2 \\to \\tilde{t}_1 h$. However,\nin a realistic supersymmetric spectrum there is always a sbottom lighter than\nthe second stop, hence the decay patterns are usually more complicated than the\nsimplified model assumptions.

This modification of the collinear factorization formula goes\nbeyond the leading power and thus a natural question arises if such cutoff can\nbe extracted from a formalism which takes into account power corrections.

To this effect, we consider the resonant\nproduction of a heavy Higgs like resonance (H 1 ) as a case study.

One of the\nuncertainties present in the modeling of the air showers is the treatment of\ndiffractive interactions, which are dominated by non - perturbative physics and\nusually described by phenomenological models. These interactions are expect to\naffect the development of the air showers, since they provide a way of\ntransporting substantial amounts of energy deep in the atmosphere, modifying\nthe global characteristics of the shower profile. In this paper we investigate\nthe impact of the diffractive interactions in the observables that can be\nmeasured in hadronic collisions at high energies and ultra - high energy cosmic\nray interactions.

They are the S3, U3 and U1 leptoquarks (LQs), and a triplet of\nSM-like vector bosons (VBs). Under the theoretical assumption that the NP\ncouples predominantly to the third generation, previous analyses found that,\nwhen constraints from other processes are taken into account, the S3, U3 and VB\nmodels cannot explain the B anomalies, but U1 is viable. In this paper, we\nreanalyze these models, but without any assumption about their couplings. We\nfind that, even in this most general case, S3 and U3 are excluded.

The\nfocus of collider studies for such a scalar is often on its direct production,\nwhere the scalar is typically only mildly boosted. The observed $W/Z$ are\ntherefore well-separated, allowing analyses for the scalar resonance in a\nstandard fashion as a low-mass diboson resonance. In this work we instead focus\non the scenario where the direct production of the scalar is suppressed, and it\nis rather produced via the decay of a significantly heavier (a few TeV mass)\nnew particle, in conjunction with SM particles. Such a process results in the\nscalar being highly boosted, rendering the $W/Z$'s from its decay merged. The\nfinal state in such a decay is a \"fat\" jet, which can be either four-pronged\n(for fully hadronic $W/Z$ decays), or may be like a $W/Z$ jet, but with leptons\nburied inside (if one of the $W/Z$ decays leptonically).

We start from a\ngauge-invariant conjecture for the infrared-dominant part of S, based on\ndynamical generation of a gluon mass M in d=4. We argue that the exact leading\nterm, of O(M), in an expansion of S in inverse powers of M is a d=3\ngauge-invariant mass term (gauged non-linear sigma model); the next leading\nterm, of O(1/M), is a conventional Yang-Mills action. The d=3 action that is\nthe sum of these two terms has center vortices as classical solutions. The d=3\ngluon mass, which we constrain to be the same as M, and d=3 coupling are\nrelated through the conjecture to the d=4 coupling strength, but at the same\ntime the dimensionless ratio in d=3 of mass to coupling squared can be\nestimated from d=3 dynamics. This allows us to estimate the QCD coupling\n$\\alpha_s(M^2)$ in terms of this strictly d=3 ratio; we find a value of about\n0.4, in good agreement with an earlier theoretical value but a little low\ncompared to QCD phenomenology. The wave functional for d=2+1 QCD has an\nexponent that is a d=2 infrared-effective action having both the\ngauge-invariant mass term and the field strength squared term, and so differs\nfrom the conventional QCD action in two dimensions, which has no mass term.\nThis conventional d=2 QCD would lead in d=3 to confinement of all color-group\nrepresentations.

These calculations should be\ncorrected for diffraction. Moreover, they miss the Gribov's inelastic shadowing\nwhich makes nuclei more transparent (color transparency). The magnitude of this\neffect rises with energy and it may dramatically affect the normalization of\nthe RHIC data. We evaluate these corrections employing the light-cone dipole\nformalism and found a rather modest corrections for the current normalization\nof the d-Au data. The results of experiments insensitive to diffraction\n(PHENIX, PHOBOS) should be renormalized by about 20% down, while those which\ninclude diffraction (STAR), by only 10%. Such a correction completely\neliminates the Cronin enhancement in the PHENIX data for pions. The largest\ntheoretical uncertainty comes from the part of the inelastic shadowing which is\nrelated to diffractive gluon radiation, or gluon shadowing. Our estimate is\nadjusted to data for the triple-Pomeron coupling, however, other models do not\nhave such a restrictions and predict much stronger gluon shadowing. Therefore,\nthe current data for high-pT hadron production in d-Au collisions at RHIC\ncannot exclude in a model independent way the possibility if initial state\nsuppression proposed by Kharzeev-Levin-McLerran. Probably the only way to\nsettle this uncertainty is a direct measurement of the inelastic d-Au cross\nsections at RHIC. Also d-Au collisions with a tagged spectator nucleon may\nserve as a sensitive probe for nuclear transparency and inelastic shadowing. We\nfound an illuminating quantum-mechanical effect: the nucleus acts like a lens\nfocusing spectators into a very narrow cone. \n\n"}
{"id": "nucl-th/0510075", "contents": "Title: Sigma Terms of Light-Quark Hadrons Abstract: A calculation of the current-quark mass dependence of hadron masses can help\nin using observational data to place constraints on the variation of nature's\nfundamental parameters. A hadron's sigma-term is a measure of this dependence.\nThe connection between a hadron's sigma-term and the Feynman-Hellmann theorem\nis illustrated with an explicit calculation for the pion using a rainbow-ladder\ntruncation of the Dyson-Schwinger equations: in the vicinity of the chiral\nlimit sigma_pi = m_pi/2. This truncation also provides a decent estimate of\nsigma_rho because the two dominant self-energy corrections to the rho-meson's\nmass largely cancel in their contribution to sigma_rho. The truncation is less\naccurate for the omega, however, because there is little to compete with an\nomega->rho+pi self-energy contribution that magnifies the value of sigma_omega\nby ~25%. A Poincare' covariant Faddeev equation, which describes baryons as\ncomposites of confined-quarks and -nonpointlike-diquarks, is solved to obtain\nthe current-quark mass dependence of the masses of the nucleon and Delta, and\nthereby sigma_N and sigma_Delta. This \"quark-core\" piece is augmented by the\n\"pion cloud\" contribution, which is positive. The analysis yields sigma_N~60MeV\nand sigma_Delta~50MeV. \n\n"}

By explaining\nhow these particles acquire phase at different rates, we explain why these\nparticles have different masses. Any free particle spin 1/2 wave function is a\nsum of plane waves with spin parallel to velocity. Each plane wave, a pair of\n2-component rotation eigenvectors, can be associated with a 2x2 matrix\nrepresentation of rotations in a Euclidean space without disturbing the plane\nwave's space-time properties. In a space with more than four dimensions, only\nrotations in a 4d subspace can be represented. So far all is well known. Now\nconsider that unrepresented rotations do not have eigenvectors, do not make\nplane waves, and do not contribute phase. The particles e, $\\pi,$ and p are\nassigned rotations in a 4d subspace of 16d, rotations in an 8d subspace of 12d,\nand rotations in a 12d subspace of 12d, respectively. The electron 4d subspace,\nassumed to be as likely to align with any one 4d subspace as with any other,\nproduces phase when aligned with the represented 4d subspace in 16d. Similarly,\nwe calculate the likelihood that a 4d subspace of the pion's 8d space aligns\nwith the represented 4d subspace in 12d. The represented 4d subspace is\ncontained in the proton's 12d space, so the proton always acquires phase. By\nthe relationship between mass and phase, the resulting particle phase ratios\nare the particle mass ratios and these are coincident with the measured mass\nratios, within about one percent. 1999 PACS number(s): 03.65.Fd\nKeywords:Algebraic methods; particle masses; rotation group \n\n"}
