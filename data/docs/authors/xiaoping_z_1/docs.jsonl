For star-forming galaxies, our UV-based SFRs compare\nremarkably well with those derived from SDSS H alpha. Deviations from perfect\nagreement between these two methods are due to differences in the dust\nattenuation estimates. In contrast to H alpha, UV provides reliable SFRs for\ngalaxies with weak or no H alpha emission, and where H alpha is contaminated\nwith an emission from an AGN. We use full-SED SFRs to calibrate a simple\nprescription that uses GALEX UV magnitudes to produce good SFRs for normal\nstar-forming galaxies. The specific SFR is considered as a function of stellar\nmass for (1) star-forming galaxies with no AGN, (2) those hosting an AGN, and\nfor (3) galaxies without H alpha emission. We find that the three have distinct\nstar formation histories, with AGN lying intermediate between the star-forming\nand the quiescent galaxies. Normal star forming galaxies (without an AGN) lie\non a relatively narrow linear sequence. Remarkably, galaxies hosting a strong\nAGN appear to represent the massive continuation of this sequence. Weak AGN,\nwhile also massive, have lower SFR, sometimes extending to the realm of\nquiescent galaxies.

The dwarfs originally consist of a low surface brightness\nstellar disk embedded in a cosmologically motivated dark matter halo. During 10\nGyr of dynamical evolution and after 5 pericentre passages the dwarfs suffer\nsubstantial mass loss and their stellar component undergoes a major\nmorphological transformation from a disk to a bar and finally to a spheroid.\nThe bar is preserved for most of the time as the angular momentum is\ntransferred outside the galaxy. A dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxy is formed via\ngradual shortening of the bar. This work thus provides a comprehensive\nquantitative explanation of a potentially crucial morphological transformation\nmechanism for dwarf galaxies that operates in groups as well as in clusters. We\ncompare three cases with different initial inclinations of the disk and find\nthat the evolution is fastest when the disk is coplanar with the orbit.

Oxygen-rich stars in the\nGalaxy and in lower metallicity galaxies have similar mass-loss rates only at\nhigh luminosities.

The hadronic vs. leptonic origin of the gamma-ray emission from the\nSupernova Remnant RX J1713.7-3946 is discussed both in the light of new\nobservations and from a theoretical point of view.\n  Methods. The existing good spatial correlation of the gamma-ray emission and\nthe nonthermal X-ray emission is analyzed theoretically. In addition, the\nrecently published new H.E.S.S. observations define the energy spectrum more\nprecisely, in particular at the high and low energy ends of the instrument's\ndynamical range. There now exist much more constraining X-ray observations from\nSuzaku that extend substantially beyond 10 keV. These new data are compared\nwith the authors' previous theoretical predictions, both for dominant hadronic\nand for simple inverse Compton models.\n  Results. Apart from the well-known MHD correlation between magnetic field\nstrength and plasma density variations, emphasized by the wind-bubble-structure\nof the remnant, it is argued that the regions of magnetic field amplification\nalso are correlated with enhanced densities of accelerated nuclear particles\nand the associated streaming instabilities. Therefore a correlation of\nnonthermal X-ray and \\gr emission is not only possible but even to be expected\nfor a hadronic emission scenario. A leptonic origin of the gamma-ray emission\nwould require an implausibly uniform strength of the magnetic field. The\nobservational and theoretical inferences about substantial field amplification\nin this remnant agree very well with the recent X-ray and \\gr observations.\n  Conclusions. All this argues strongly for the dominance of hadronic \\grs in\nthe \\gr emission spectrum and a fortiori for an overwhelming contribution of\nnuclear cosmic ray particles to the nonthermal energy in this remnant. \n\n"}

Abstract: We present and analyse new R-band frames of the gravitationally lensed double\nquasar FBQ 0951+2635. These images were obtained with the 1.5m AZT-22 Telescope\nat Maidanak (Uzbekistan) in the 2001-2006 period. Previous results in the R\nband (1999-2001 period) and the new data allow us to discuss the dominant kind\nof microlensing variability in FBQ 0951+2635. The time evolution of the flux\nratio A/B does not favour the continuous production of short-timescale (months)\nflares in the faintest quasar component B (crossing the central region of the\nlensing galaxy). Instead of a rapid variability scenario, the observations are\nconsistent with the existence of a long-timescale fluctuation. The flux ratio\nshows a bump in the 2003-2004 period and a quasi-flat trend in more recent\nepochs. Apart from the global behaviour of A/B, we study the intra-year\nvariability over the first semester of 2004, which is reasonably well sampled.\nShort-timescale microlensing is not detected in that period.

A potentially\ndangerous feature of this scenario is the existence of perturbations in the\nradial field direction, which have red power spectrum. We show, however, that\nto the linear order in the small parameter - the quartic self-coupling - the\ninfrared effects are completely harmless, as they can be absorbed into field\nredefinition.

Of the 72 targets which\nremain candidate and confirmed white dwarfs with near-infrared excess, 43 are\nspatially resolved into two or more components, and a total of 12 systems are\npotentially triples. There is a possible, slight deficit of earlier spectral\ntypes (bluer colors) among the spatially unresolved companions, exactly the\nopposite of expectations if significant mass is transferred to the companion\nduring the common envelope phase. Using the best available distance estimates,\nthe low mass companions to white dwarfs exhibit a bimodal distribution in\nprojected separation.

In order to probe the accretion and jet physical\nproperties in LLAGNs as a class, we model the broadband radio to X-rays\nspectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 21 LLAGNs in low-ionization nuclear\nemission-line regions (LINERs) with a coupled accretion-jet model.

We find that the radio emission is severely\nunderpredicted by ADAF models and is explained by the relativistic jet. The\norigin of the X-ray radiation in most sources can be explained by three\ndistinct scenarios: the X-rays can be dominated by emission from the ADAF, or\nthe jet, or the X-rays can arise from a jet-ADAF combination in which both\ncomponents contribute to the emission with similar importance.

All this information is essential for understanding\nthe energetic particle acceleration that we discuss further in the review. For\ninstance, we show how fast and slow modes accelerate energetic particles\nthrough the second order Fermi acceleration, while density fluctuations\ngenerate magnetic fields in pre-shock regions enabling the first order Fermi\nacceleration of high energy cosmic rays. Very importantly, however, the first\norder Fermi cosmic ray acceleration is also possible in sites of magnetic\nreconnection. In the presence of turbulence this reconnection gets fast and we\npresent numerical evidence supporting the predictions of the Lazarian &\nVishniac (1999) model of fast reconnection.

To\ndetermine the implications of these search results for the LF and SFR density\nat z~9, we introduce a new differential approach to deriving these quantities\nin lensing fields. Our procedure is to derive the evolution by comparing the\nnumber of z~9-10 galaxy candidates found in CLASH with the number of galaxies\nin a slightly lower redshift sample (after correcting for the differences in\nselection volumes), here taken to be z~8. This procedure takes advantage of the\nfact that the relative volumes available for the z~8 and z~9-10 selections\nbehind lensing clusters are not greatly dependent on the details of the lensing\nmodels.

Precise experimental measurements of the Higgs couplings at the LHC\nand at the proposed next-generation facilities will allow for a robust test of\nthe phase transition dynamics. To illustrate this point, in this paper we focus\non the scenario in which loops of a new scalar field are responsible for the\nfirst-order phase transition, and study a selection of benchmark models with\nvarious SM gauge quantum numbers of the new scalar. We find that the current\nLHC measurement of the Higgs coupling to gluons already excludes the\npossibility of a first-order phase transition induced by a scalar in a sextet,\nor larger, representation of the SU(3)_c. Future LHC experiments (including\nHL-LHC) will be able to definitively probe the case when the new scalar is a\ncolor triplet.

Since the inflaton quartic coupling is very small, once\nquantum corrections through the gauge and Yukawa interactions are taken into\naccount, the inflaton effective potential most likely becomes unstable.

When\ninitiated with a vertical magnetic field of either zero or finite net flux, our\nglobal cylindrical simulations exhibit the magnetorotational instability (MRI)\nand large scale dynamo growth of radially alternating mean fields, averaged\nover height and azimuth.

In this case, the\nultrarelativistic particles accelerated at the termination surface of the\npulsar wind may be reaccelerated in the converging flow system formed by the\noutflow from the wind termination shock and the inflow from the bow shock. An\noutcome of this reacceleration is the creation of particle distributions with\nhard spectra, such as required to explain the observed synchrotron spectra with\nphoton indices Gamma <~ 1.5. The presence of this hard component is specific to\nPWNe with bow shocks (BSPWNe). The accelerated particles may end up containing\na substantial fraction of the shock ram pressure. For typical ISM and pulsar\nparameters, the positrons released by these systems are numerous enough to\ncontribute a substantial fraction of the positrons detected as galactic cosmic\nray particles above few tens and up to several hundred GeV.

The efficiency of thermal conduction in\nthe intracluster medium (ICM) is complicated by the existence of turbulence and\nmagnetic fields, and has received a lot of attention in the literature.\nPrevious studies suggest that the magnetothermal instability developed in outer\nregions of galaxy clusters would drive magnetic field lines preferentially\nradial, resulting in efficient conduction along the radial direction. Using a\nseries of spherically-symmetric simulations, here we investigate the impact of\nthermal conduction on the observed temperature distributions in outer regions\nof three massive clusters, and find that thermal conduction substantially\nmodifies the ICM temperature profile. Within 3 Gyr, the gas temperature at a\nrepresentative radius of $0.3r_{500}$ typically decreases by ~10 - 20% and the\naverage temperature slope between $0.3r_{500}$ and $r_{500}$ drops by ~ 30 -\n40%, indicating that the observed ICM would not stay in a long-term equilibrium\nstate in the presence of thermal conduction. However, X-ray observations show\nthat the outer regions of massive clusters have remarkably similar\nradially-declining temperature profiles, suggesting that they should be quite\nstable. Our study thus suggests that the effective conductivity along the\nradial direction must be suppressed below the Spitzer value by a factor of 10\nor more, unless additional heating sources offset conductive cooling and\nmaintain the observed temperature distributions. Our study provides a\nsmoking-gun evidence for the suppression of parallel conduction along magnetic\nfield lines in low-collisionality plasmas by kinetic mirror or whistler\ninstabilities. \n\n"}

This scheme over-predicts the number densities of low to\nintermediate mass galaxies. In addition, a good agreement with the observed\npassive fractions can be obtained only by assuming that cooling can continue on\nsatellites, at the rate predicted considering halo properties at infall, even\nafter their parent dark matter substructure is stripped below the resolution of\nthe simulation.

Here we consider extracting <T_21> b_21(z) using a\ncombination of future redshifted 21 cm and [CII] line-intensity mapping data\nsets. Our method exploits the dependence of the 21 cm-[CII]-[CII]\ncross-bispectrum on the shape of triangle configurations in Fourier space.

The quest for the optimal optical coronagraph designs has\nmade rapid progress in recent years thanks to the Segmented Coronagraph Design\nand Analysis (SCDA) initiative led by the Exoplanet Exploration Program at\nNASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. As a result, several types of\nhigh-performance designs have emerged that make use of dual deformable mirrors\nto (1) correct for optical aberrations and (2) suppress diffracted starlight\nfrom obstructions and discontinuities in the telescope pupil. However, the\nalgorithms used to compute the optimal deformable mirror surface tend to be\ncomputationally intensive, prohibiting large scale design surveys.

SNe that are randomly\ndistributed throughout a galactic disc drive inefficient galactic winds because\nmost supernova remnants lose their energy radiatively before breaking out of\nthe disc. Accounting for the fact that most star formation is clustered\nalleviates this problem. Super-bubbles driven by the combined effects of\nclustered SNe propagate rapidly enough to break out of galactic discs well\nbefore the clusters' SNe stop going off. The radiative losses post-breakout are\nreduced dramatically and a large fraction ($\\gtrsim 0.2$) of the energy\nreleased by SNe vents into the halo powering a strong galactic wind. These\nenergetic winds are capable of providing strong preventative feedback and eject\nsubstantial mass from the galaxy with outflow rates on the order of the star\nformation rate. The momentum flux in the wind is only of order that injected by\nthe SNe, because the hot gas vents before doing significant work on the\nsurroundings.

This is\nbecause, the differential masses and radii are better constrained than absolute\nplanetary masses and radii. We explore such correlations and data specific to\nthe multiplanetary-system of TRAPPIST-1 and study their value for our\nunderstanding of planet interiors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the rocky\ninterior of planets in a multi-planetary system can be preferentially probed by\nstudying the most dense planet representing a rocky interior analogue. Our\nmethodology includes a Bayesian inference analysis that uses a Markov chain\nMonte Carlo scheme. Our interior estimates account for the anticipated\nvariability in the compositions and layer thicknesses of core, mantle, water\noceans and ice layers, and a gas envelope. Our results show that (1) interior\nestimates significantly depend on available abundance proxies and (2) that the\nimportance of inter-dependent planetary data for interior characterization is\ncomparable to changes in data precision by 30 %. For the interiors of\nTRAPPIST-1 planets, we find that possible water mass fractions generally range\nfrom 0-25 %. The lack of a clear trend of water budgets with orbital period or\nplanet mass challenges possible formation scenarios.

We explore a broad region\nof parameter space by considering different Reynolds numbers and magnetic-field\nconfigurations, including net vertical flux, net toroidal-vertical flux and\nzero net flux. Remarkably, we find that the level of turbulence and\nangular-momentum transport are not greatly affected by large anisotropic\nviscosities: the Maxwell and Reynolds stresses do not differ much from the MHD\nresult. Angular-momentum transport in Braginskii MHD still depends strongly on\nisotropic dissipation, e.g., the isotropic magnetic Prandtl number, even when\nthe anisotropic viscosity is orders of magnitude larger than the isotropic\ndiffusivities. Braginskii viscosity nevertheless changes the flow structure,\nrearranging the turbulence to largely counter the parallel rate of strain from\nthe background shear.

Such models combined with fairly well understood physics like the quark\nsubstructure of the nucleon and the nuclear form factor and the spin response\nfunction of the nucleus, permit the evaluation of the event rate for\nLSP-nucleus elastic scattering.

We illustrate this\npossibility using cosmological Monte Carlo simulations of the merger history of\ndark matter halos and their associated SMBHs. In our most extreme models, in\norder to populate nearly every bright galaxy with a SMBH at z=0, only a few\npercent of the halos with virial temperatures above 10^4 K are required to\nharbor a SMBH at high redshift.

To this end, we investigate the origin of the dispersion\nobserved in the evolution of both nitrogen-to-oxygen abundance ratio and galaxy\nluminosity as a function of metallicity for a large sample of starburst\ngalaxies. We find that the variation of the star formation efficiency, in the\nframework of continuous star formation models, produce a scatter equivalent to\nwhat is observed in the N/O versus O/H diagram for low-mass HII galaxies only.\nHowever, continous star formation models are unable to reproduce i) the scatter\nobserved for massive starburst and UV-selected galaxies in the N/O versus O/H\nrelation, and ii) the scatter in the luminosity versus O/H scaling relation\nobserved for the whole sample of starburst galaxies. The dispersion associated\nwith the distribution of N/O as a function of metallicity, for both low-mass\nand massive galaxies, is well explained in the framework of bursting star\nformation models.

The submillimetre camera SCUBA, mounted on the JCMT, is the first\nlarge-scale submillimetre array, and as such is ideal for combatting the\neffects of the atmosphere. For example, we find that the off-source pixels are\ncrucial for removing sky-noise. Benefitting from several years of SCUBA\noperation, a database of deep SCUBA observations has been constructed to better\nunderstand the nature of sky-noise and the effects of the atmosphere on\ninstrument sensitivity.

We\ncompute this contribution using the Stecker-Salamon model. For normal galaxies,\nthe emission is due to cosmic-ray interactions with diffuse gas. Our key\nassumption here is that the cosmic-ray flux in a galaxy is proportional to the\nsupernova rate and thus the massive star formation rate, quantified\nobservationally by the cosmic star formation rate (CSFR).

Indeed, it is claimed that many SNR are not `seen' in GeV or\nTeV gamma rays, whereas `they should have been'.\n  We have looked at this problem and we conclude that the idea of CR production\nin SNR cannot be faulted in this way, if the evacuation of ambient gas by the\nstellar wind of the progenitor star and, frequently, by associated earlier\nclose-by SN, is taken into account; such phenomena are expected for the\nimportant Type II SN which result from very massive stars.\n  Other SNR have, apparently, been seen and the interaction of SNR-accelerated\nparticles with adjacent molecular clouds has been deemed responsible.

Quantifying supernova feedback Abstract: We investigate how the empirical properties of hot X-ray-emitting gas in a\nsample of seven starburst and three normal edge-on spiral galaxies (a sample\nwhich covers the full range of star-formation intensity found in disk galaxies)\ncorrelate with the size, mass, star formation rate and star formation intensity\nin the host galaxies. Intriguingly, the diffuse X-ray properties of the normal\nspirals (both in their disks and halos) fall where extrapolation of the trends\nfrom the starburst galaxies with superwinds would predict. We demonstrate that\nthe luminosity of diffuse X-ray emission in both disk and halo is directly\nproportional to the rate of mechanical energy feedback from massive stars.\nNevertheless, with only three non-starburst normal spiral galaxies it is hard\nto exclude an accretion-based origin for extra-planar diffuse X-ray emission\naround normal star-forming galaxies. Larger galaxies have more extended\nX-ray-emitting halos, but galaxy mass appears to play no role in determining\nthe properties of the disk or extra-planar X-ray emitting plasma. The\ncombination of these luminosity and size correlations leads to a correlation\nbetween the surface brightness of the diffuse X-ray emission and the mean star\nformation rate per unit area in the disk (L_FIR/D_25^2). We argue that the\ncrucial spatial region around a galaxy that controls whether gas in\nstarburst-driven superwinds will escape into the IGM is not the outer halo ~100\nkpc from the host galaxy, but the inner few halo scale heights, within ~20 kpc\nof the galaxy plane. Given the properties of the gaseous halos we observe,\nsuperwind outflows from disk galaxies of mass M ~ 10^10 -- 10^11 Msun should\nstill eject some fraction of their material into the IGM.

We show that the structure and strength of the magnetic field may be\nconstrained by radio and IR observations of the early afterglow, where plasma\neffects on the polarization of propagating radiation are significant. We\ncalculate these propagation effects for cold and relativistic plasmas, and find\nthat in the presence of a uniform equipartition field the degree of linear\npolarization is suppressed, and circular polarization prevails at low\nfrequencies, nu < 1-3 GHz, (2x10^11 Hz < nu < few x 10^14 Hz) in the forward\n(reverse) shock. At higher frequencies linear polarization dominates. At the\nfrequency of the transition between circular and linear polarization, the net\nlevel of polarization is minimal, ~10-20%. These features are nearly\nindependent of the circumburst density. The transition frequency is smaller by\na factor of ~10 when the uniform field is much weaker than equipartition. The\ndependence of these results on viewing geometry, outflow collimation and\nmagnetic field orientation is discussed. When the configuration of the field is\nentangled over length scales much smaller than the extent of the emitting\nplasma, the aforementioned effects should not be observed and a linear\npolarization at the few % level is expected.

Observations suggest that some neutron stars are born with magnetic\nfields of at least 10^15 G while theoretical considerations give an upper limit\nof 10^18 G for the protoneutron star magnetic fields. We calculate the rates\nfor the above neutrino processes in strong magnetic fields of 10^16 G. We find\nthat the main effect of such magnetic fields is to change the equations of\nstate through the phase space of electron and positron, which differs from the\nclassical case due to quantization of the motion of electron and positron\nperpendicular to the magnetic field. As a result, the cooling rate can be\ngreatly reduced by magnetic fields of 10^16 G for typical conditions below the\nstalled shock and a nonuniform protoneutron star magnetic field (e.g., a dipole\nfield) can introduce a large angular dependence of the cooling rate.

If this detection is confirmed and the\ndetection rate turns out to be typical, then the volume averaged ultraviolet\nemissivity must be rising rapidly with increasing redshift. For a magnification\ndue to gravitational lensing by a factor M>25 estimated by Pell'o et al., the\ninferred star formation rate density at z=10 would be about one order of\nmagnitude higher than estimates of the star formation rate density at z=6.\nObjects at z=10 would contribute substantially to the total source counts at\n1.6 micronm and the estimated space density of sources may exceed the space\ndensity of dark matter haloes in a LCDM model.

The dark energy is taken to be a\ncomplex scalar field, where the radial field has a Mexican hat potential.\nDuring inflation, the radial component is trapped near the maximum of its\npotential. At the end of inflation, it rolls down to the minimum. The dark\nenergy today is taken to be a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson. The perturbations\ngenerated during inflation are amplified by the rolling of the radial field. We\nalso examine the use of the variable decay mechanism in order to generate an\nanti-correlation between the dark energy perturbations and the curvature\nperturbation. We show that using this mechanism then constrains the properties\nof the dark energy and its evolution from redshift one until today. \n\n"}

It is baffling that baryons manage to settle the dark\nmatter gravitational potential in such a precise way, leaving no \"messy\"\nfingerprints of the merging events and \"gastrophysical\" feedbacks expected in\nthe history of a galaxy in a concordance Universe. This correlation of gravity\nwith baryonic mass can be interpreted from several non-standard angles,\nespecially as a modification of gravity called TeVeS, in which no galactic dark\nmatter is needed. In this theory, the baryon-gravity relation is captured by\nthe dieletric-like function mu of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND),\ncontrolling the transition from 1/r^2 attraction in the strong gravity regime\nto 1/r attraction in the weak regime. Here, we study this mu-function in\ndetail.

In this\npaper, we compute constraints on inflationary parameters within a more general\nframework that includes other physically motivated parameters such as a nonzero\nneutrino mass. We find that a strong degeneracy between the tensor-to-scalar\nratio r and the neutrino mass prevents lambda phi^4 from being excluded by\npresent data. Reversing the argument, if lambda phi^4 is the correct model of\ninflation, it predicts a sum of neutrino masses at 0.3-0.5 eV, a range\ncompatible with present experimental limits and within the reach of the next\ngeneration of neutrino mass measurements. We also discuss the associated\nconstraints on the dark matter density, the dark energy equation of state, and\nspatial curvature, and show that the allowed regions are significantly altered.\nImportantly, we find an allowed range of 0.094 < Omega_c h^2 < 0.136 for the\ndark matter density, a factor of two larger than that reported in previous\nstudies.

We will show that if there is a persistent, non-dissipating\ncurrent running along the magnetic flux tubes, the force between magnetic flux\ntubes may be attractive, resulting in a type-I, rather than a type-II,\nsuperconductor. If this is the case, the conflict between the observed\nprecession and the canonical estimation of the Landau-Ginzburg parameter (which\nsuggests type II behaviour) will be automatically resolved. Such a current\narises in some condensed matter systems and may also appear in QCD dense matter\nas a consequence of quantum anomalies.

Inflation would be more generic in models where the\ninter-brane interactions are much weaker. The spectrum of primordial density\nfluctuations predicted has index n slightly less than 1, and an acceptable\namplitude, provided that the extra dimensions have linear size 1/r ~ 10^{12}\nGeV. Reheating occurs as in hybrid inflation, with the tachyonic instability of\nthe brane-antibrane system taking over for small separations. The tachyon field\ncan induce a cascade mechanism within which higher-dimension branes annihilate\ninto lower-dimension ones. We argue that such a cascade naturally stops with\nthe production of 3-branes in 10-dimensional string theory. \n\n"}

The proton fraction is determined by the nuclear symmetry\nenergy whose density dependence may be constrained by measuring the neutron\nradius of a heavy nucleus, such as 208Pb. Such a measurement is necessary for a\nreliable extrapolation of the proton fraction to the higher densities present\nin the neutron star. A large neutron radius in 208Pb implies a stiff symmetry\nenergy that grows rapidly with density, thereby favoring a high proton fraction\nand allowing direct URCA cooling. Predictions for the neutron radius in 208Pb\nare correlated to the proton fraction in dense matter by using a variety of\nrelativistic effective field-theory models. Models that predict a neutron (Rn)\nminus proton (Rp) root-mean-square radius in 208Pb to be Rn-Rp<0.20 fm have\nproton fractions too small to allow the direct URCA cooling of 1.4 solar-mass\nneutron stars. Conversely, if Rn-Rp>0.25 fm, the direct URCA process is allowed\n(by all models) to cool down a 1.4 solar-mass neutron star. The Parity Radius\nExperiment at Jefferson Laboratory aims to measure the neutron radius in 208Pb\naccurately and model independently via parity-violating electron scattering.\nSuch a measurement would greatly enhance our ability to either confirm or\ndismiss the direct URCA cooling of neutron stars. \n\n"}
