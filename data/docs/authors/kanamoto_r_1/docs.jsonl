We consider\nlarge-scale hydrodynamic motions where the viscosity and heat conduction can be\nneglected, and one arrives at the equations of ideal gas dynamics with an\nadditional term describing bulk energy losses due to inelastic collisions. We\nemploy Lagrangian coordinates and derive a broad family of exact non-stationary\nanalytical solutions that depend only on one spatial coordinate. These\nsolutions exhibit a new type of singularity, where the gas density blows up in\na finite time when starting from smooth initial conditions. The density blowups\nsignal formation of close-packed clusters of particles. As the density blow-up\ntime $t_c$ is approached, the maximum density exhibits a power law $\\sim\n(t_c-t)^{-2}$. The velocity gradient blows up as $\\sim - (t_c-t)^{-1}$ while\nthe velocity itself remains continuous and develops a cusp (rather than a shock\ndiscontinuity) at the singularity. The gas temperature vanishes at the\nsingularity, and the singularity follows the isobaric scenario: the gas\npressure remains finite and approximately uniform in space and constant in time\nclose to the singularity. An additional exact solution shows that the density\nblowup, of the same type, may coexist with an \"ordinary\" shock, at which the\nhydrodynamic fields are discontinuous but finite. We confirm stability of the\nexact solutions with respect to small one-dimensional perturbations by solving\nthe ideal hydrodynamic equations numerically. Furthermore, numerical solutions\nshow that the local features of the density blowup hold universally,\nindependently of details of the initial and boundary conditions. \n\n"}

It is an approach based on\nanother known universal dynamics: The evolutionary dynamics first conceived by\nDarwin and Wallace, referring to as Darwinian dynamics in the present paper,\nhas been found to be universally valid in biology; The statistical mechanics\nand thermodynamics, while enormously successful in physics, have been in an\nawkward situation of wanting a consistent dynamical understanding; Here we\npresent from a formal point of view an exploration of the connection between\nthermodynamics and Darwinian dynamics and a few related topics. We first show\nthat the stochasticity in Darwinian dynamics implies the existence temperature,\nhence the canonical distribution of Boltzmann-Gibbs type. In term of relative\nentropy the Second Law of thermodynamics is dynamically demonstrated without\ndetailed balance condition, and is valid regardless of size of the system.

We study these on a\nnetwork consisting of a mixture of 2- and 3-fold oordinated randomly-connected\nnodes of concentration p and 1-p, respectively, with p varying between 0 and 1.\nVarying the parameter p from p=0 (3-regular graph of infinite dimension) to p=1\n(2-regular graph - 1D chain) allows us to investigate their behaviour under\nsuch structural changes.

Inspired by the two\nimportant works in 2009 and in 1929, we have noted that a condition we call\n\"thermodynamic normality\" for a macroscopic observable guarantees the approach\nto equilibrium (in the sense that a measurement of the observable at time $t$\nalmost certainly yields a result close to the corresponding microcanonical\naverage for a sufficiently long and typical $t$). A crucial point is that we\nmake no assumptions on the initial state of the system, except that its energy\nis distributed close to a certain macroscopic value. We also present three\n(rather artificial) models in which the thermodynamic normality can be\nestablished, thus providing concrete examples in which the approach to\nequilibrium is rigorously justified. Note that this kind of results which hold\nfor ANY initial state are never possible in classical systems. We are thus\ndealing with a mechanism which is peculiar to quantum systems.

The natural\nvalue of the energy density of the equilibrium the self-sustained vacuum is\nzero. Cosmology is discussed as the process of relaxation of vacuum towards the\nequilibrium state. The present value of the cosmological constant is very small\ncompared to the Planck scale, because the present Universe is very old and thus\nis close to equilibrium.

This has provided a very convenient way to analyze the structure of\nindecomposable Virasoro modules and to obtain fusion rules for a variety of\nmodels such as (boundary) percolation etc. LCFTs allow for additional quantum\nnumbers describing the fine structure of the indecomposable modules, and\ngeneralizing the `b-number' introduced initially by Gurarie for the c=0 case.\nThe determination of these indecomposability parameters has given rise to a lot\nof algebraic work, but their physical meaning has remained somewhat elusive. In\na recent paper, a way to measure b for boundary percolation and polymers was\nproposed. We generalize this work here by devising a general strategy to\ncompute matrix elements of Virasoro generators from the numerical analysis of\nlattice models and their continuum limit.

The Kuramoto model under periodically\nswitching interactions has the same type of phase transition as the original\nmean-field model.

The formulas in the existing literature are frequently\nincomplete, incorrect, or lack a derivation; in particular, Hall viscosity is\noverlooked. Our approach begins from the response to a uniform external strain\nfield, which is an active time-dependent coordinate transformation in d space\ndimensions. These transformations form the group GL(d,R) of invertible\nmatrices, and the infinitesimal generators are called strain generators. These\nenable us to express the Kubo formula in different ways, related by Ward\nidentities; some of these make contact with the adiabatic transport approach.\nFor Galilean-invariant systems, we derive a relation between the stress\nresponse tensor and the conductivity tensor that is valid at all frequencies\nand in both the presence and absence of a magnetic field.

To do\nthis, we implement and propose scaling rules for each one of the fundamental\nparameters: generation number, height of the barriers and length of the system.\nWith this in mind we have been able to reproduce the reference transmission\nspectrum, applying the appropriate scaling rule, by means of the scaled\ntransmission spectrum.

These continuous heat devices can be arbitrarily complex\nmultipartite systems, and yet their working principle is always the same: They\nare made up of several elementary three-level stages operating in parallel. As\na result, it is possible to devise external black-box testing strategies to\nlearn about their functionality and performance regardless of any internal\ndetails. In particular, one such heat pump can be tested by coupling a\ntwo-level spin to one of its contact transitions.

Central to this phenomenon are Hamiltonians whose insulating gap is\ncontrolled by a multi-dimensional (usually two-dimensional) parameter space in\nwhich paths can be defined for adiabatic changes in the Hamiltonian, i.e.,\nwithout closing the gap. Here, we extend the concept of Thouless pumps of band\ninsulators by considering a larger, three-dimensional parameter space. We show\nthat the connectivity of this parameter space is crucial for defining quantum\npumps, demonstrating that, as opposed to the conventional two-dimensional case,\npumped quantities depend not only on the initial and final points of\nHamiltonian evolution but also on the class of the chosen path and preserved\nsymmetries.

For coherent transport the photon absorption\nprocesses create multiple photon steps in the energy distribution, where the\nnumber of steps is dependent on the relation between the amplitude of the field\neV and the photon energy \\omega. Furthermore we observe that for the slow field\nregime, \\omega \\tau_D < 1, the photon absorption is highly time-dependent.

To better understand the molecular origin of Debye peak we\nran large scale molecular dynamics simulations and performed several different\ndistance-dependent decompositions of the low frequency dielectric spectra,\nfinding that it involves processes that take place on scales of 1.5-2.0 nm. We\nalso calculated the $k$-dependence of the Debye relaxation, finding it to be\nhighly dispersive. These findings are inconsistent with models that relate\nDebye relaxation to local processes such as the rotation/translation of\nmolecules after H-bond breaking. We introduce the spectrumfitter Python package\nfor fitting dielectric spectra and analyze different ways of fitting the high\nfrequency excess, such as including one or two additional Debye peaks.

The DPT occurs when the field frequency is on the order of\nthe inverse of an intrinsic lifetime associated with the transitions between\nthe two stable states in a static field of the same magnitude as the amplitude\nof the oscillating field. The DPT is continuous and belongs to the same\nuniversality class as the equilibrium phase transition of the Ising model in\nzero field [G. Korniss et al., Phys. Rev. E 63, 016120 (2001); H. Fujisaka et\nal., Phys. Rev. E 63, 036109 (2001)]. However, it has previously been claimed\nthat the DPT becomes discontinuous at temperatures below a tricritical point\n[M. Acharyya, Phys. Rev.

This claim was based on\nobservations in dynamic Monte Carlo simulations of a multipeaked probability\ndensity for the dynamic order parameter and negative values of the fourth-order\ncumulant ratio.

For sufficiently\nsmall systems and low temperatures, the continuous DPT is replaced, not by a\ndiscontinuous phase transition, but by a crossover to stochastic resonance. In\nthe infinite-system limit the stochastic-resonance regime vanishes, and the\ncontinuous DPT should persist for all nonzero temperatures. \n\n"}

To\nunderstand recent experimental results, we use the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii\nequations and the generalized nonlinear sigma model. An axisymmetric vortex\nstate, which was observed by the JILA group, can be regarded as a topologically\ntrivial skyrmion in the pseudospin representation. The internal, coherent\ncoupling between the two components breaks the axisymmetry of the vortex state,\nresulting in a stable vortex molecule (a meron pair). We also mention\nunconventional vortex states and monopole excitations in a spin-1 Bose-Einstein\ncondensate.
