Abstract: We compute standard model penguin amplitudes in nonleptonic B-decays to light\ncharmless mesons using tree amplitude data to fix hadronic parameters. The\nleading calculation is carried out for the alphas(mb) penguin contributions\nfrom charm quark, up quark, and magnetic penguin loops in the NDR and HV\nrenormalization schemes. Power suppressed penguins that are proportional to the\nchiral condensate are also computed using a new factorization formula for these\nterms, which is derived working to all orders in alphas(sqrt{mb\\Lambda}). We\ndemonstrate using SCET1 that this formula exhibits only small perturbative\nphases and does not have endpoint singularities. Due to our use of data to fix\nhadronic parameters we obtain significantly more accurate predictions for the\nshort-distance standard model penguin amplitudes than have been found in the\npast. Analyzing data in B-> pi pi, B->K pi, and B->rho rho for the penguin\namplitudes we find that standard model short-distance imaginary parts are an\norder of magnitude smaller than current measurements, while real parts are up\nto a factor of two smaller with the correct sign. This difference is most\nlikely a consequence of long-distance charm contributions or new physics.\nConstraints on the type of new physics that could help explain the data are\nderived, and used to show that current data favors sizeable long-distance\nstrong phases. \n\n"}

We explore the possibility that they could be observably large\nin CMB, LSS, and Lyman-alpha data. We find that a k^3 component with a cutoff\nat some maximum k can modestly improve the fits (Delta chi^2=2.0, 5.4) of the\nlow multipoles (l ~ 10 - 50) or the second peak (l ~ 540) of the CMB angular\nspectrum when the three-year WMAP data are used. Moreover, the results from\nWMAP are consistent with the CBI, ACBAR, 2dFGRS, and SDSS data when they are\nincluded in the analysis. Including the SDSS galaxy clustering power spectrum,\nwe find weak positive evidence for the k^3 component at the level of Delta chi'\n= 2.4, with the caveat that the nonlinear evolution of the power spectrum may\nnot be properly treated in the presence of the k^3 distortion. To investigate\nthe high-k regime, we use the Lyman-alpha forest data (LUQAS, Croft et al., and\nSDSS Lyman-alpha); here we find evidence at the level Delta chi^2' = 3.8.\nConsidering that there are two additional free parameters in the model, the\nabove results do not give a strong evidence for features; however, they show\nthat surprisingly large bumps are not ruled out.

Numerical\nsimulations are carried out at the lattice spacing of $a=0.0907(13)$fm on a\n$32^3\\times 64$ lattice with the use of the DDHMC algorithm to reduce the\nup-down quark mass. Further algorithmic improvements make possible the\nsimulation whose ud quark mass is as light as the physical value.

An analysis of the PS meson sector with SU(3)\nChPT reveals that the NLO corrections are large at the physical strange quark\nmass.

In this situation,\nthe standard method used to determine the behavior of cosmological\nperturbations breaks down. We present a generic method, based on the uniform\napproximation, to analytically derive the power spectra of scalar and tensor\nperturbations. For this purpose, a simple hierarchy of parameters, related to\nthe sound speed of the cosmological fluctuations and its successive\nderivatives, is introduced in a k-inflation analogue of the Hubble flow\nfunctions. The scalar spectral index and its running are obtained up to next to\nnext to leading order for all k-inflationary models. This result relies on the\nexistence of a well-motivated initial state, which is not trivial in the\npresent context: having the wavelength of the Fourier mode smaller than the\nsonic horizon is indeed not enough and some conditions on the dynamics of the\nsound speed are also required. Our method is then applied to various models\nencountered in the literature. After deriving a generic slow-roll trajectory\nvalid for any DBI model, simple formulae for the cosmological observables are\nobtained. In particular, the running, as the spectral index, for the so-called\nUV and IR brane inflationary models is found to be uniquely determined by the\n't Hooft coupling.

The warped 5D framework\ncan provide solutions to both the Planck-weak and flavor hierarchies of the SM.\nIt is also related (via the AdS/CFT correspondence) to partial compositeness of\nthe SM. We focus on the dominant contributions in the two-site model to two\nobservables which we argue provide the strongest flavor constraints, namely,\nepsilon_K and BR(b -> s gamma), where contributions in the two-site model occur\nat tree and loop-level, respectively. In particular, we demonstrate that a\n\"tension\" exists between these two observables in the sense that they have\nopposite dependence on composite site Yukawa couplings, making it difficult to\ndecouple flavor-violating effects using this parameter.

We study the resulting connection\nbetween neutrino masses and mixing parameters and the leptoquark decays, and\nshow that different light neutrino hierarchies imply distinctive leptoquark\ndecay signatures. We also discuss low-energy constraints implied by searches\nfor charged lepton flavour violation, studies of meson decays, and electroweak\nprecision data. We perform a detailed parton-level study of the leptoquark\nsignals and the Standard Model backgrounds at the LHC. With the clean final\nstates containing a di-lepton plus two jets, the QCD production of the\nleptoquark pair can be observed for a leptoquark mass of one TeV and beyond. By\nexamining the lepton flavor structure of the observed events, one could further\ntest the model predictions related to the neutrino mass spectrum. In\nparticular, b-flavor tagging will be useful in distinguishing the neutrino mass\npattern and possibly probing an unknown Majorana phase in the Inverted\nHierarchy or the Quasi-Degenerate scenario. Electroweak associated production\nof the leptoquark doublet can also be useful in identifying the quantum numbers\nof the leptoquarks and distinguishing between the neutrino mass spectra, even\nthough the corresponding event rates are smaller than for QCD production. We\nfind that with only the clean channel of mu+ E_T jets, one could expect an\nobservable signal for a leptoquark masses of about 600 GeV or higher. \n\n"}

In this\narticle we describe simulations of full QCD using the improved staggered quark\nformalism, ``asqtad'' fermions.

Integrating out these fermions at tree level we derive general\nformulae that can be used in any model containing such particles.

In particular we demonstrate explicitly that this protection is not\nspoiled by the mixing of the SM quarks with the KK fermions, which is\nguaranteed by the underlying P_LR symmetry. We find that the impact of KK\nfermions on the Z-couplings, while not negligible, is significantly smaller\nthan the one coming from the mixing of Z with the heavy KK gauge bosons Z_H and\nZ'.The situation is similar for the W couplings with the only exception of the\ntb coupling where the impact of KK fermions can in principle be larger than the\neffects that are induced by gauge boson mixing.

We perform a careful analysis of the thermal freezeout\nof dark matter annihilation in such a scenario. We compute the range of \"boost\nfactors\" arising from Sommerfeld enhancement in the local halo for models which\nproduce the correct relic density, and show the effect of including constraints\non the saturated enhancement from the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We\nfind that boost factors from Sommerfeld enhancement of up to ~800 are possible\nin the local halo. When the CMB bounds on the saturated enhancement are\napplied, the maximal boost factor is reduced to ~400 for 1-2 TeV dark matter\nand sub-GeV force carriers, but remains large enough to explain the observed\nFermi and PAMELA electronic signals. We describe regions in the DM mass-boost\nfactor plane where the cosmic ray data is well fit for a range of final states,\nand show that Sommerfeld enhancement alone is enough to provide the large\nannihilation cross sections required to fit the data, although for light\nmediator masses (less than ~200 MeV) there is tension with the CMB constraints\nin the absence of astrophysical boost factors from substructure.

A crucial step toward verifying such evidence is the measurement of the\nwould-be dark matter mass. If, for example, the invisible particles are found\nto have masses consistent with zero, it may prove very challenging to ascertain\nwhether light dark matter or neutrinos are being observed. We assume that new\ninvisible particles are pair-produced in a ttbar-like topology and use two\nMT2-based methods to measure the masses of the particles associated with the\nmissing energy. Instead of simulating events and backgrounds, we estimate the\nuncertainty associated with measuring the mass of the invisible particle by\nassuming a fixed value of the uncertainty associated with the location of the\nMT2 endpoint.

This improvement is due to the development of active and passive\nshielding techniques, offline discrimination techniques allowed by highly\ngranular readout patterns, as well as the use of radiopure detector components.\nThe status of the intensive R&D to reduce the background levels will be\ndescribed, including the operation of replica detectors in test benches and the\ndetailed Geant4 simulation of the detector setup and the detector response,\nwhich has allowed the progressive understanding of background origins. The best\nlevels currently achieved in a test setup operating in the Canfranc Underground\nLaboratory (LSC) are as low as $\\sim10^{-7}$\\ckcs, showing the good prospects\nof this technology for application in the future IAXO. \n\n"}

For example, models where the gauginos are Dirac instead of Majorana\nhave recently received more attention. Beside allowing for a supersoft SUSY\nbreaking mechanism where the gauginos only provide finite threshold corrections\nto scalar masses, the cross section for the production of a squark pairs is\nreduced. In addition, Dirac gauginos can be used to build models that possess a\nU(1)R symmetry. This symmetry can then be identified with a lepton number,\nleading to models that are quite different from conventional scenarios. The\nsneutrinos in these models can acquire a vev and give mass to the leptons and\nthe down-type squark.

Recent studies of the excess in data from the Fermi telescope have cast\ndoubt on an explanation for the excess arising from unknown astrophysical\nsources. A potential source of the excess is the annihilation of dark matter\ninto standard model final states, giving rise to gamma ray production. The\nspectrum of the excess is well fit by 30 GeV dark matter annihilating into a\npair of b quarks with a cross section of the same order of magnitude as\nexpected for a thermal relic. Simple models that can lead to this annihilation\nchannel for dark matter are in strong tension with null results from direct\ndetection experiments.

The core is due to primary protons which suffer\nmultiple Coulomb scattering (MCS) and slow down by multiple collisions with\natomic electrons (Bethe-Bloch theory). The halo is due to charged secondaries,\nmany of them protons, from elastic interactions with H, elastic and inelastic\ninteractions with O, and nonelastic interactions with O. We show that the halo\nradius is roughly one third of the beam range. The aura is due to neutral\nsecondaries (neutrons and gamma rays). Spray denotes dose, avoidable in\nprinciple, coming in from the beam line.\n  We have measured the absolute dose at 177 MeV using a test beam in a water\ntank. The beam monitor was a PPIC 'proton counter' and the field IC a dose\ncalibrated Exradin T1. We took depth-dose scans at ten displacements from the\nbeam axis ranging from 0 to 10 cm. The dose spans five orders of magnitude, and\nthe transition from halo to aura is obvious.\n  We present model-dependent (MD) and model-independent (MI) fits to these\ndata. The MD fit has 25 parameters, and the goodness of fit (rms\n(measurement/fit) - 1) is 15%. The MI fit uses cubic spline fits in depth and\nradius. The goodness of fit is 9%. This fit is more portable and conceptually\nsimpler.\n  We discuss the prevalent parameterization of the core/halo originated by the\nPSI group. We argue that its use of T(w), a mass stopping power which includes\nenergy deposited by nuclear secondaries, is incorrect. The electromagnetic\n(Bethe-Bloch) mass stopping power should be used instead. In consequence,\n'Bragg peak chamber' measurements and associated corrections are, in our view,\nirrelevant. Furthermore, using T(w) leads to spurious excess dose on the axis\nof the core around midrange, which may be significant in fields involving\nrelatively few pencil beams. \n\n"}

Since the data seem to agree with the SM expectations,\nany nonstandard couplings will be strongly constrained. First we investigate,\nin a model independent way, the constraints on the nonstandard Higgs couplings\nwith the fermions and the vector bosons in view of high energy unitarity and\nthe measured value of the Higgs to diphoton signal strength. Then we\nconcentrate on a particular BSM scenario, namely, the two Higgs-doublet models\n(2HDMs). Consistency of the Higgs data with the corresponding SM predictions\nstrongly motivates us to work in the {\\em alignment limit}. In this limit,\nincluding the informations of Higgs mass and its SM-like nature, we find many\nnew constraints on the nonstandard masses and $\\tan\\beta$. We also study the\nconstraints on the charged scalar mass arising from the $h\\to \\gamma\\gamma$\nsignal strength measurements and observe that the charged scalar does not\nnecessarily decouple from the diphoton decay width.

Di-hadron fragmentation functions can be extracted from\nsemi-inclusive electron-positron annihilation data. They also appear in\nobservables describing the semi-inclusive production of two hadrons in\ndeep-inelastic scattering of leptons off nucleons or in hadron-hadron\ncollisions. When a target nucleon is transversely polarized, a specific\nchiral-odd di-hadron fragmentation function can be used as the analyzer of the\nnet density of transversely polarized quarks in a transversely polarized\nnucleon, the so-called transversity distribution. The latter can be extracted\nthrough suitable single-spin asymmetries in the framework of collinear\nfactorization, thus in a much simpler framework with respect to the traditional\none in single-hadron fragmentation. At subleading twist, the same chiral-odd\ndi-hadron fragmentation function provides the cleanest access to the poorly\nknown twist-3 parton distribution $e(x)$, which is intimately related to the\nmechanism of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in QCD. When sensitive to\ndetails of transverse momentum dynamics of partons, the di-hadron fragmentation\nfunctions for a longitudinally polarized quark can be connected to the\nlongitudinal jet handedness to explore possible effects due to $CP-$violation\nof the QCD vacuum.

The Banks-Casher relation\nties the chiral condensate to the density of low lying modes; thus, it is\nplausible that removal of such modes could lead to a regime where spontaneous\nchiral symmetry breaking does not occur. Surprising, a pattern of identical\ncorrelation functions was observed that is larger than can be explained by a\nrestoration of chiral symmetry. This suggests that a larger symmetry---one that\nis not present in the QCD lagrangian---emerges when these modes are removed.\nPreviously it was argued that this emergent symmetry was SU(4). However, when\nthe low-lying modes are removed, the correlation functions of sources in the\nSU(4) 15-plet of spin-1 mesons appear to coincide with the correlation function\nof the SU(4) singlet. A natural explanation for this is an emergent symmetry\nlarger than SU(4). In this work, it is shown that there exists no continuous\nsymmetry whose generators in the field theory are spatial integrals of local\noperators that can account for the full pattern of identical correlation\nfunctions unless the apparent coincidence of the singlet channel with the\n15-plet is accidental. \n\n"}

It is based on selected publications, which represented at\nthat time my major scientific contributions as an experimental physicist to the\nfield of particle accelerators and detectors applied to medical diagnostics and\ntherapy. The thesis is structured in two parts. In Part I, Chapter 1 presents\nan introduction to accelerators and detectors applied to medicine, with\nparticular focus on cancer hadrontherapy and on the production of radioactive\nisotopes. In Chapter 2, my publications on medical particle accelerators are\nintroduced and put into their perspective. In particular, high frequency linear\naccelerators for hadrontherapy are discussed together with the new Bern\ncyclotron laboratory. Chapter 3 is dedicated to particle detectors with\nparticular emphasis on three instruments I contributed to propose and develop:\nsegmented ionization chambers for hadrontherapy, a proton radiography apparatus\nwith nuclear emulsion films, and a beam monitor detector for ion beams based on\ndoped silica fibres.

We pay careful attention to\nthe self-consistency of the model, including the gravitational influence of the\ndark disk on other disk components, and to the net velocity of the tracer\nstars. We find that the data set exhibits a non-zero bulk velocity in the\nvertical direction as well as a displacement from the expected location at the\nGalactic midplane. If not properly accounted for, these features would bias the\nbound toward low dark disk mass. We therefore perform our analysis two ways. In\nthe first, traditional method, we subtract the mean velocity and displacement\nfrom the tracers' phase space distributions. In the second method, we perform a\nnon-equilibrium version of the HF method to derive a bound on the dark disk\nparameters for an oscillating tracer distribution.

Due to the reduction of the spatial hit\nuncertainties, multiple Coulomb scattering in the detector layers becomes the\ndominant source for tracking uncertainties. In this case long distance effects\ncan be ignored for the momentum measurement, and the track fit can consequently\nbe formulated as a sum of independent fits to hit triplets. In this paper we\npresent an analytical solution for a three-dimensional triplet(s) fit in a\nhomogeneous magnetic field based on a multiple scattering model. Track fitting\nof hit triplets is performed using a linearization ansatz. The momentum\nresolution is discussed for a typical spectrometer setup. Furthermore the track\nfit is compared with other track fits for two different pixel detector\ngeometries, namely the Mu3e experiment at PSI and a typical high-energy\ncollider experiment. For a large momentum range the triplets fit provides a\nsignificantly better performance than a single helix fit.

At LHC and top RHIC\nenergies, QCD matter is studied at very high temperatures and nearly vanishing\nnet-baryon densities. There is evidence that a Quark-Gluon-Plasma (QGP) was\ncreated at experiments at RHIC and LHC. The transition from the QGP back to the\nhadron gas is found to be a smooth cross over. For larger net-baryon densities\nand lower temperatures, it is expected that the QCD phase diagram exhibits a\nrich structure, such as a first-order phase transition between hadronic and\npartonic matter which terminates in a critical point, or exotic phases like\nquarkyonic matter. The discovery of these landmarks would be a breakthrough in\nour understanding of the strong interaction and is therefore in the focus of\nvarious high-energy heavy-ion research programs. The Compressed Baryonic Matter\n(CBM) experiment at FAIR will play a unique role in the exploration of the QCD\nphase diagram in the region of high net-baryon densities, because it is\ndesigned to run at unprecedented interaction rates. High-rate operation is the\nkey prerequisite for high-precision measurements of multi-differential\nobservables and of rare diagnostic probes which are sensitive to the dense\nphase of the nuclear fireball.

This symmetry\ngroup postulates the existence of a fundamental or preferred direction in\nspace-time. We study its implications by using an effective action which\nviolates Lorentz invariance but respects VSR. We find that the problem of\nfinding the masses of fundamental fermions is in general intractable in the\npresence of VSR term. The problem can be solved only in special cases which we\npursue in this paper. We next determine the signal of VSR in torsion pendulum\nexperiment as well as clock comparison experiment. We find that VSR predicts a\nsignal which is different from other Lorentz violating theories and hence a\ndedicated data analysis is needed in order to impose reliable limits. Assuming\nthat signal is absent in data we determine the limits that can be imposed on\nthe VSR parameters.

In\nthis work, we show that looking for these effects in solar neutrinos, it could\nbe possible to set bounds in the neutrino properties such as the neutrino\nmagnetic moment. Furthermore, for neutrinos coming from a supernova, we show\nthat even in the case of an extremely small neutrino magnetic moment, $\\mu_\\nu\n\\sim 10^{-19}\\mu_B$, there will be measurable differences in both the number of\nevents and in the spectra of Majorana and Dirac neutrinos. \n\n"}

This chiral chemical potential\ngives rise to a contribution to the electric current density of the plasma\n(\\emph{chiral magnetic effect}). We present a self-consistent treatment of the\n\\emph{chiral MHD equations}, which include the back-reaction of the magnetic\nfield on a chiral chemical potential and its interaction with the plasma\nvelocity field. A number of novel phenomena are exhibited. First, we show that\nthe chiral magnetic effect decreases the frequency of the Alfv\\'{e}n wave for\nincompressible flows, increases the frequencies of the Alfv\\'{e}n wave and of\nthe fast magnetosonic wave for compressible flows, and decreases the frequency\nof the slow magnetosonic wave.

In the presence of turbulence with vanishing mean kinetic\nhelicity, the derived mean-field chiral MHD equations describe turbulent\nlarge-scale dynamos caused by the chiral alpha effect, which is dominant for\nlarge fluid and magnetic Reynolds numbers. The chiral alpha effect is due to an\ninteraction of the chiral magnetic effect and fluctuations of the small-scale\ncurrent produced by tangling magnetic fluctuations (which are generated by\ntangling of the large-scale magnetic field by sheared velocity fluctuations).\nThese dynamo effects may have interesting consequences in the dynamics of the\nearly universe, neutron stars, and the quark--gluon plasma. \n\n"}

This can be explained by an additional fourth flavor\nsterile neutrino at a larger scale than the existing three flavor neutrinos.\nThe NOvA experiment consists of two finely segmented, liquid scintillator\ndetectors operating 14 .6 mrad off-axis from the NuMI muon-neutrino beam.

We find that the initial Glauber type\nnucleon-nucleon collisions generate negative $v_1$ for nucleons at midrapidity\ndue to the presence of spectator matter, and this negative nucleon $v_1$ is\nturned to be positive by the meson-baryon interactions at the beam energy\nregion of $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} < 30$ GeV.

These range from nuclear processes on the stellar surface to\nprocesses in electron degenerate matter at subnuclear densities to boson\ncondensates and the existence of new states of baryonic matter--like color\nsuperconducting quark matter--at supernuclear densities.

Consequently, new sources of flavor\nand CP violation are present in the theory, mediated by a low scale of few TeV.\nHowever, in spite of the low flavor scale, the most severe bounds on the scale\nof NP are evaded since these are related to flavor violation in the first two\ngenerations.

We argue that, in spite of the\nsuccessful SM unitary triangle fit and contrary to the common lore, such a\nsizable contribution to Delta F=2 processes of ~ 40% (with arbitrary phase)\ncompared to SM is presently allowed since B-factories are only beginning to\nconstrain these models.

The beam electrons\nthemselves were used to measure the scintillation light output, and a blue\nlight emitting diode (LED) was used to track variations of crystals\ntransparency. We report on the correlation of the LED measurement with\nradiation damage by the beams and also show that it can accurately monitor the\ncrystals recovery from such damage. \n\n"}

A model of irradiated silicon based upon two defect levels with\nopposite charge states and the trapping of charge carriers can be tuned to\nproduce a good description of the measured charge collection profiles in the\nfluence range from 0.5x10^{14} Neq/cm^2 to 5.9x10^{14} Neq/cm^2. The model\ncorrectly predicts the variation in the profiles as the temperature is changed\nfrom -10C to -25C. The measured charge collection profiles are inconsistent\nwith the linearly-varying electric fields predicted by the usual description\nbased upon a uniform effective doping density. This observation calls into\nquestion the practice of using effective doping densities to characterize\nirradiated silicon. \n\n"}

While this kind of\nprocedure provides rigorous coverage, it may be affected by large overcoverage,\nand/or produce results with counterintuitive behavior with respect to the\nuncertainty on the nuisance parameters, or other undesirable properties. We\ndescribe a choice of ordering algorithm that provides results with good general\nproperties, the correct behavior for small uncertainties, and limited\novercoverage. \n\n"}
