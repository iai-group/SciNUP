In the impact parameter\nrepresentation, the radiating particle splits into a multi-particle virtual\nstate, whose wavefunction is then multiplied by individual eikonal factors. As\na phenomenological application, we study QCD radiation in transplanckian\ncollisions of TeV-scale gravity models.

In this framework the Ricci scalar acts as the kinetical\nterm of the strain field whose potential is represented by the additional\nterms. Here we are presenting the linearised version of the theory in order to\nanalyze its implications in the weak field limit. First we discuss the recovery\nof the Newtonian limit.

The probabilities of quantum theory turn out to be just ordinary\nrelative frequencies probabilities in these ensembles. Laws for the evolution\nof the beables of individual systems are given such that their ensemble\nrelative frequencies evolve in a way that reproduces the predictions of quantum\nmechanics. These laws are highly non-local and involve a new kind of\ninteraction between the members of an ensemble that define a quantum state.\nThese include a stochastic process by which individual systems copy the beables\nof other systems in the ensembles of which they are a member. The probabilities\nfor these copy processes do not depend on where the systems are in space, but\ndo depend on the distribution of beables in the ensemble. Macroscopic systems\nthen are distinguished by being large and complex enough that they have no\ncopies in the universe.

This implies novel\ndepartures from quantum mechanics for systems in quantum states that can be\nexpected to have few copies in the universe.

In\nthe bosonic models we show the existence of an exotic first/second order\ntransition from a phase with a well defined background geometry (the fuzzy\nsphere) to a phase with commuting matrices with no geometry in the sense of\nConnes. At the transition point the sphere expands abruptly to infinite size\nthen it evaporates as we increase the temperature (the gauge coupling\nconstant). The transition looks first order due to the discontinuity in the\naction whereas it looks second order due to the divergent peak in the specific\nheat. The fuzzy sphere is stable for the supersymmetric models in the sense\nthat the bosonic phase transition is turned into a very slow crossover\ntransition. The transition point is found to scale to zero with N. We\nconjecture that the transition from the background sphere to the phase of\ncommuting matrices is associated with spontaneous supersymmetry breaking.

We show that the late-time waveform\nof massive scalar perturbations is dominated by a universal oscillatory\ndecaying tail, which appears due to curvature effects.

Besides\npossible appearance of hyperons and new phases, the most uncertain part of the\nnucleonic EOS is currently the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy.\nTo provide information that may help break the EOS-gravity degeneracy, we\ninvestigate effects of symmetry energy within its uncertain range determined by\nterrestrial nuclear laboratory experiments on the gravitational binding energy\nand spacetime curvature of neutron stars within GR and the scalar-tensor (ST)\ntheory of gravity. In particular, we focus on effects of the following\nparameters characterizing the EOS of neutron-rich nucleonic matter: (1) the\nincompressibility $K_0$ of symmetric nuclear matter, (2) the slope $L$ of\nsymmetry energy at saturation density and (3) the high-density behavior of\nsymmetry energy. We find that the variation of either the density slope $L$ or\nthe high-density behavior of symmetry energy leads to large changes in both the\nbinding energy and curvature of neutron stars while effects of varying the more\nconstrained $K_0$ are negligibly small. The difference in predictions using the\nGR and the ST theory appears only for massive neutron stars, and is\nsignificantly smaller than the differences resulting from variations in the\nsymmetry energy. We conclude that within the ST theory of gravity, the\nEOS-gravity degeneracy has been broken by the recent relativistic pulsar\nmeasurements, and that measurements of neutron star properties sensitive to the\ncompactness constrain mainly the density dependence of the symmetry energy. \n\n"}

In particular, this simple\ncompletion of $\\zeta$ provides a powerful method to construct harmonic Maass\nforms of weight zero which serve as canonical lifts under the differential\noperator $\\xi_{0}$ of weight 2 cusp forms, and this has been shown in to have\ndeep applications to determining vanishing criteria for central values and\nderivatives of twisted Hasse-Weil $L$-functions for elliptic curves.\n  Here we offer a new and motivated proof of Eisenstein's theorem, relying on\nthe basic theory of differential operators for Jacobi forms together with a\nclassical identity for the first quasi-period of a lattice. A quick inspection\nof the proof shows that it also allows one to easily construct more general\nnon-holomorphic elliptic functions. \n\n"}

The construction is based on a particular\nmodel of computation, developed by Alan Turing, with cosmic observers (CO),\ncosmic measures (CM) and cosmic symmetries (CS) described by Turing machines.\nCO machines always start with a blank tape and CM machines take CO's Turing\nnumber (also known as description number or G{\\\" o}del number) as input and\noutput the corresponding probability. Similarly, CS machines take CO's Turing\nnumber as input, but output either one if the CO machines are in the same\nequivalence class or zero otherwise.

Defined by a simple nested recurrence and\nan initial condition, the sequence looks approximately linear, though with a\nlot of noise. But, nobody even knows whether the sequence is infinite. In the\nyears since Hofstadter published his sequence, various people have found\nvariants with predictable behavior. Oftentimes, the resulting sequence looks\ncomplicated but provably grows linearly. Other times, the sequences are\neventually linear recurrent. Proofs describing the behaviors of both types of\nsequence are inductive. In the first case, the inductive hypotheses are fairly\nad-hoc, but the proofs in the second case are highly automatable. This suggests\nthat a search for more sequences like these may be fruitful. In this paper, we\ndevelop a step-by-step symbolic algorithm to search for these sequences. Using\nthis algorithm, we determine that such sequences come in infinite families that\nare themselves plentiful.

The first degeneration corresponds to the\nusual Beilinson-Drinfeld fusion of divisors on the curve. The second\ndegeneration is new and corresponds to what we call Vinberg fusion: It is\nobtained not by degenerating divisors on the curve, but by degenerating the\ngroup G via the Vinberg semigroup.

We focus on two different models where the scalar field couples\nlinearly or quadratically to the standard model of matter fields. For both\nthese cases, we derive the solutions of the scalar field. We also derive from\nfirst principles the expressions for two types of observables: (i) the local\ncomparison of two atomic sensors that are differently sensitive to the\nconstants of Nature and (ii) the local differential acceleration between two\ntest-masses with different compositions. For the linear coupling, we recover\nthat the signatures induced by DM on both observables are the sum of harmonic\nand Yukawa terms. For the quadratic coupling on the other hand, the signatures\nderived for both types of observables turn out to be a sum of a time\nindependent term and of an harmonic oscillation, whose amplitudes both depend\non the position. Such a behavior is new and can make experiments in space more\nsensitive than terrestrial ones. Besides, the observables present some\ninteresting non-linear behaviors that are due to the amplification or to the\nscreening of the scalar-field, depending on the parameters of the theory, and\non the compactness of the source of the gravitational field.

Due to the\nrelative smallness of the solar angular momentum J and the large values of the\nplanetary semimajor axes a, the gravitomagnetic precessions, which affect the\nnodes Omega and the perihelia omega and are proportional to J/a^3, are of the\norder of 10^-3 arcseconds per century only for, e.g., Mercury. This value lies\njust at the edge of the present-day observational sensitivity in reconstructing\nthe planetary orbits, although future missions to Mercury like Messenger and\nBepiColombo could allow to increase it. The major problems come from the main\nsources of systematic errors.

We conclude that, independent of the\ndetails of the scalar-field theory describing the varying `constant', the\ncondition for cosmological variations to be measured locally is almost always\nsatisfied in physically realistic situations. The proof of this statement\nprovides a rigorous justification for using terrestrial experiments and solar\nsystem observations to constrain or detect any cosmological time variations in\nthe traditional `constants' of Nature. \n\n"}
