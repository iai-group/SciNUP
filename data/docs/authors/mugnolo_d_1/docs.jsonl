How can we describe\nthe mechanics of self-similar structures in the static and dynamic framework?\nPhysical systems with self-similarity as a symmetry property require the\nintroduction of non-local particle-particle interactions and a (quasi-)\ncontinuous distribution of mass. We construct self-similar functions and linear\noperators such as a self-similar variant of the Laplacian and of the\nD'Alembertian wave operator. The obtained self-similar linear wave equation\ndescribes the dynamics of a quasi-continuous linear chain of infinite length\nwith a spatially self-similar distribution of nonlocal inter-particle springs.\nThe self-similarity of the nonlocal harmonic particle-particle interactions\nresults in a dispersion relation of the form of a Weierstrass-Mandelbrot\nfunction which exhibits self-similar and fractal features. We deduce a\ncontinuum approximation that links the self-similar Laplacian to fractional\nintegrals and which yields in the low-frequency regime a power law frequency\ndependence for the oscillator density.

RSR is a graph renormalization procedure that locally\naggregates nodes to produce a coarse grained network. It is analogous to the\n(quasi-)parallel renormalization schemes introduced by C. Song {\\it et al.}\n(Nature {\\bf 433}, 392 (2005)) and studied more recently by F. Radicchi {\\it et\nal.} (Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 101}, 148701 (2008)), but much simpler and easier\nto implement. In this first paper we apply RSR to critical trees and derive\nanalytical results consistent with numerical simulations. Critical trees\nexhibit three regimes in their evolution under RSR: (i) An initial regime\n$N_0^{\\nu}\\lesssim N<N_0$, where $N$ is the number of nodes at some step in the\nrenormalization and $N_0$ is the initial size. RSR in this regime is described\nby a mean field theory and fluctuations from one realization to another are\nsmall. The exponent $\\nu=1/2$ is derived using random walk arguments. The\ndegree distribution becomes broader under successive renormalization --\nreaching a power law, $p_k\\sim 1/k^{\\gamma}$ with $\\gamma=2$ and a variance\nthat diverges as $N_0^{1/2}$ at the end of this regime. Both of these results\nare derived based on a scaling theory. (ii) An intermediate regime for\n$N_0^{1/4}\\lesssim N \\lesssim N_0^{1/2}$, in which hubs develop, and\nfluctuations between different realizations of the RSR are large. Crossover\nfunctions exhibiting finite size scaling, in the critical region $N\\sim\nN_0^{1/2} \\to \\infty$, connect the behaviors in the first two regimes. (iii)\nThe last regime, for $1 \\ll N\\lesssim N_0^{1/4}$, is characterized by the\nappearance of star configurations with a central hub surrounded by many leaves.\nThe distribution of sizes where stars first form is found numerically to be a\npower law up to a cutoff that scales as $N_0^{\\nu_{star}}$ with\n$\\nu_{star}\\approx 1/4$. \n\n"}

A key aspect\nof studying social networks is understanding the evolutionary dynamics and the\nmechanism by which these structures grow and change over time. While current\nmethods are well suited to describe static features of networks, they are less\ncapable of specifying models of change and simulating network evolution. In the\nfollowing paper I present a new method for modeling network growth and\nevolution. This method relies on graph motifs to generate simulated network\ndata with particular structural characteristic. This technique departs notably\nfrom current methods both in form and function. Rather than a closed-form\nmodel, or stochastic implementation from a single class of graphs, the proposed\n\"graph motif model\" provides a framework for building flexible and complex\nmodels of network evolution.

In\nRSR the network is locally coarse grained by choosing at each renormalization\nstep a node at random and joining it to all its neighbors. Compared to previous\n(quasi-)parallel renormalization methods [C.Song et.al], RSR allows a more\nfine-grained analysis of the renormalization group (RG) flow, and unravels new\nfeatures, that were not discussed in the previous analyses. In particular we\nfind that all networks exhibit a second order transition in their RG flow. This\nphase transition is associated with the emergence of a giant hub and can be\nviewed as a new variant of percolation, called agglomerative percolation. We\nclaim that this transition exists also in previous graph renormalization\nschemes and explains some of the scaling laws seen there. For critical trees it\nhappens as N/N0 -> 0 in the limit of large systems (where N0 is the initial\nsize of the graph and N its size at a given RSR step). In contrast, it happens\nat finite N/N0 in sparse ER graphs and in the annealed model, while it happens\nfor N/N0 -> 1 on scale-free networks. Critical exponents seem to depend on the\ntype of the graph but not on the average degree and obey usual scaling\nrelations for percolation phenomena. For the annealed model they agree with the\nexponents obtained from a mean-field theory. At late times, the networks\nexhibit a star-like structure in agreement with the results of Radicchi et. al.\nWhile degree distributions are of main interest when regarding the scheme as\nnetwork renormalization, mass distributions (which are more relevant when\nconsidering 'supernodes' as clusters) are much easier to study using the fast\nNewman-Ziff algorithm for percolation, allowing us to obtain very high\nstatistics. \n\n"}

This remarkable property becomes explicit in the\nLagrangian formulation which describes a relativistic particle moving in a 1+1\ndimensional spacetime whose metric is constructed from the functions U and V.\nGeneral covariance is maintained by quantization and we find that the spectra\nare closely related to the geometry of the associated spacetimes. In\nparticular, the Hamiltonian H_I corresponds to a flat spacetime, whereas its\nspectrum approaches the Riemann zeros in average. The latter property also\nholds for the model H_II, whose underlying spacetime is asymptotically flat.\nThese results suggest the existence of a Hamiltonian whose underlying spacetime\nencodes the prime numbers, and whose spectrum provides the Riemann zeros. \n\n"}

This approach can increase ad efficacy for two\nmain reasons: peers' affiliations reflect unobserved consumer characteristics,\nwhich are correlated along the social network; and the inclusion of social cues\n(i.e., peers' association with a brand) alongside ads affect responses via\nsocial influence processes. For these reasons, responses may be increased when\nmultiple social signals are presented with ads, and when ads are affiliated\nwith peers who are strong, rather than weak, ties.\n  We conduct two very large field experiments that identify the effect of\nsocial cues on consumer responses to ads, measured in terms of ad clicks and\nthe formation of connections with the advertised entity. In the first\nexperiment, we randomize the number of social cues present in word-of-mouth\nadvertising, and measure how responses increase as a function of the number of\ncues. The second experiment examines the effect of augmenting traditional ad\nunits with a minimal social cue (i.e., displaying a peer's affiliation below an\nad in light grey text). On average, this cue causes significant increases in ad\nperformance.

This idea has\nfound its way in numerous applications such as Google's PageRank algorithm and\nothers. Recently, new studies suggested that human navigation may better be\nmodeled using higher order Markov chain models, i.e., the next page depends on\na longer history of past clicks. Yet, this finding is preliminary and does not\naccount for the higher complexity of higher order Markov chain models which is\nwhy the memoryless model is still widely used. In this work we thoroughly\npresent a diverse array of advanced inference methods for determining the\nappropriate Markov chain order.

We examine the complete dynamics of the Twitter information\nnetwork, where users post and reshare information while they also create and\ndestroy connections.

While\nthere are a variety of metrics that can be used to specify the quality of a\ngiven community, one common theme is that flows tend to stay within\ncommunities. Hence, we expect cycles to play an important role in community\ndetection. For undirected graphs, the importance of triangles -- an undirected\n3-cycle -- has been known for a long time and can be used to improve community\ndetection. In directed graphs, the situation is more nuanced. The smallest\ncycle is simply two nodes with a reciprocal connection, and using information\nabout reciprocation has proven to improve community detection. Our new idea is\nbased on the four types of directed triangles that contain cycles. To identify\ncommunities in directed networks, then, we propose an undirected edge-weighting\nscheme based on the type of the directed triangles in which edges are involved.\nWe also propose a new metric on quality of the communities that is based on the\nnumber of 3-cycles that are split across communities.

We also derive pointwise error estimates for the\ncorresponding discrete operators which are based on finite data sets;\ngeneralizing a result of Singer which was restricted to fixed bandwidth\nkernels. Our analysis reveals how areas of small sampling density lead to large\nerrors, particularly for fixed bandwidth kernels. We explain the limitation of\nthe existing theory to data sampled from compact manifolds by showing that when\nthe sampling density is not bounded away from zero (which implies that the data\nlies on an open set) the error estimates for fixed bandwidth kernels will be\nunbounded. We show that this limitation can be overcome by choosing a bandwidth\nfunction inversely proportional to the sampling density (which can be estimated\nfrom data) which allows us to control the error estimates uniformly over a\nnon-compact manifold.

Typically algorithms for community detection either partition the\ngraph (non-overlapping communities) or find node covers (overlapping\ncommunities).\n  In this paper, we propose a particularly simple semi-supervised learning\nalgorithm for finding out communities.

The kinetic part has\na one-dimensional structure allowing a description through transfer matrices\nwhich involve some Schur complement. For such operators we introduce the notion\nof having one propagating channel and extend theorems from the theory of\none-dimensional Jacobi operators that relate the behavior of transfer matrices\nwith the spectrum.

In\nessence, in a certain energy region the kinetic part averages the random\npotentials along shells and the transfer matrices behave similar as for a\none-dimensional operator with random potential of decaying variance.

Our interpretation is that this quantification must\nbe done at a minimum of three scales. These scales are at the level of:\nindividual nodes, individual communities, and the network as a whole. Each of\nthese scales involves quantitative features of community structure that are not\naccurately represented at the other scales, but are important for defining a\nparticular notion of community. Our work focuses on providing sensible ways to\nquantify what is desired at each of these scales for a notion of community\napplicable to social networks, and using these models to develop a community\ndetection algorithm.

This class of\nprocesses has the property that the intensity of single large jumps dominates\nthe intensity of all multiple large jumps. We find that the decay rates of\neigenfunctions depend on the process via specific preference rates in\nparticular jump scenarios, and depend on the potential through the distance of\nthe corresponding eigenvalue from the edge of the continuous spectrum. We prove\nthat the conditions of the jump-paring class imply that for all eigenvalues the\ncorresponding positive eigenfunctions decay at most as rapidly as the L\\'evy\nintensity. This condition is sharp in the sense that if the jump-paring\nproperty fails to hold, then eigenfunction decay becomes slower than the decay\nof the L\\'evy intensity.

A possible way to understand their structure is by\nanalysing the smaller components that constitute them, namely network motifs\nand graphlets. Graphlets are particularly well suited to compare networks and\nto assess their level of similarity but are almost always used as small\nundirected graphs of up to five nodes, thus limiting their applicability in\ndirected networks. However, a large set of interesting biological networks such\nas metabolic, cell signaling or transcriptional regulatory networks are\nintrinsically directional, and using metrics that ignore edge direction may\ngravely hinder information extraction. The applicability of graphlets is\nextended to directed networks by considering the edge direction of the\ngraphlets.

Latent Interest Detection in\n  Multi-Community Networks Abstract: Most social network analysis works at the level of interactions between\nusers.

Our goal is\nto find community pairs with similar userbases, but dissimilar content; we\nrefer to this type of relationship as a \"latent interest.\" Detection of latent\ninterests not only provides a perspective on individual users as they shift\nbetween roles (student, sports fan, political activist) but also gives insight\ninto the dynamics of Reddit as a whole.

Hence, finding consistent overlapping communities in dynamic networks\nwithout any prior knowledge about the number of communities is still an\ninteresting open research problem.

The fresh look advocated here permeates benefits from convex\noptimization and stationarity of graph signals, in order to identify the graph\nshift operator (a matrix representation of the graph) given only its\neigenvectors. These spectral templates can be obtained, e.g., from the sample\ncovariance of independent graph signals diffused on the sought network.

By formulating structural consistency as a continuity result on\nthe graphon space, we obtain robust results that are completely independent of\nthe data generating mechanism. In particular, our results apply in settings\nwhere observations are not independent, thereby significantly generalizing the\ncommon probabilistic approach where data are assumed to be i.i.d.\n  In order to make precise the notion of structural consistency of graph\npartitioning, we begin by extending the theory of graph limits to include\nvertex colored graphons.

When such issues emerge on social media, we\noften observe the creation of 'echo chambers', i.e., situations where\nlike-minded people reinforce each other's opinion, but do not get exposed to\nthe views of the opposing side. In this paper we study algorithmic techniques\nfor bridging these chambers, and thus, reducing controversy. Specifically, we\nrepresent the discussion on a controversial issue with an endorsement graph,\nand cast our problem as an edge-recommendation problem on this graph. The goal\nof the recommendation is to reduce the controversy score of the graph, which is\nmeasured by a recently-developed metric based on random walks. At the same\ntime, we take into account the acceptance probability of the recommended edge,\nwhich represents how likely the edge is to materialize in the endorsement\ngraph.

We derive\na very general and novel class of elastic structures that can induce plasmonic\nresonances.

In graph signal processing, this is manifested\nin the form of different graph shifts and their induced algebraic systems. In\nthis paper, we propose the unifying Z-Laplacian framework, whose instances can\nact as graph shift operators. As a generalization of the traditional graph\nLaplacian, the Z-Laplacian spans the space of all possible Z-matrices, i.e.,\nreal square matrices with nonpositive off-diagonal entries. We show that the\nZ-Laplacian can model general continuous-time dynamical processes, including\ninformation flows and epidemic spreading on a given graph. It is also closely\nrelated to general nonnegative graph filters in the discrete time domain. We\nshowcase its flexibility by considering two applications.

The analysis of the system's dynamics depends on the selection\nof the appropriate analytical tools. After characterizing similarities between\nstates, a critical step lies in the choice of a distance between graphs capable\nof reflecting such similarities. While the literature offers a number of\ndistances that one could a priori choose from, their properties have been\nlittle investigated and no guidelines regarding the choice of such a distance\nhave yet been provided. In particular, most graph distances consider that the\nnodes are exchangeable and do not take into account node identities. Accounting\nfor the alignment of the graphs enables us to enhance these distances'\nsensitivity to perturbations in the network and detect important changes in\ngraph dynamics.

This\nprocess is known as the 2-Choices dynamics and is arguably the most basic\nnon-trivial opinion dynamics modeling voting behavior on social networks.\nDespite its apparent simplicity, 2-Choices has been analytically characterized\nonly on restricted network classes---under assumptions on the initial\nconfiguration that establish it as a fast majority consensus protocol.\n  In this work, we aim at contributing to the understanding of the 2-Choices\ndynamics by considering its behavior on a class of networks with core-periphery\nstructure, a well-known topological assumption in social networks. In a\nnutshell, assume that a densely-connected subset of agents, the core, holds a\ndifferent opinion from the rest of the network, the periphery.

However, the concept of a \"good\" community is very\ncontext-dependent and it is relatively complicated to deduce community\ncharacteristics using available community detection techniques. In reality, the\nexistence of a gap between structural goodness quality metrics and expected\ntopological patterns creates a confusion in evaluating community structures. In\nthis paper, we introduce an empirical multivariate analysis of different\nstructural goodness properties in order to characterize several detectable\ncommunity topologies. Specifically, we show that a combination of two\nrepresentative structural dimensions including community transitivity and hub\ndominance allows to distinguish different topologies such as star-based,\nclique-based, string-based and grid-based structures.

Many measures based on the network topology have emerged over the\nyears to identify influential nodes such as Betweenness, Closeness, and\nEigenvalue centrality. However, although most real-world networks are modular,\nfew measures exploit this property. Recent works have shown that it has a\nsignificant effect on the dynamics on networks. In a modular network, a node\nhas two types of influence: a local influence (on the nodes of its community)\nthrough its intra-community links and a global influence (on the nodes in other\ncommunities) through its inter-community links. Depending of the strength of\nthe community structure, these two components are more or less influential.\nBased on this idea, we propose to extend all the standard centrality measures\ndefined for networks with no community structure to modular networks. The\nso-called \"Modular centrality\" is a two dimensional vector. Its first component\nquantifies the local influence of a node in its community while the second\ncomponent quantifies its global influence on the other communities of the\nnetwork. In order to illustrate the effectiveness of the Modular centrality\nextensions, comparison with their scalar counterpart are performed in an\nepidemic process setting.

With the advent of digital sampling\ntechnologies and social media the modes of cultural transmission may have\nshifted, and music communities may have become decoupled from geography. The\naim of the current study was to determine whether drum breaks are culturally\ntransmitted through musical collaboration networks, and to identify the factors\ndriving the evolution of these networks. Using network-based diffusion analysis\nwe found strong evidence for the cultural transmission of drum breaks via\ncollaboration between artists, and identified several demographic variables\nthat bias transmission.

This paper establishes the converse: Each continuous tensor\nproduct systems of Hilbert spaces comes with measure types of distributions of\nrandom (closed) sets in [0,1] or $R_+$. These measure types are stationary and\nfactorise over disjoint intervals. In a special case of this construction, the\ncorresponding measure type is an invariant of the product system and the range\nof the invariant is characterized.\n  Moreover, based on a detailed study of this kind of measure types, we\nconstruct for each stationary factorizing measure type a continuous tensor\nproduct systems of Hilbert spaces such that this measure type arises as the\nbefore mentioned invariant.\n  The measure types of the above described kind are connected with\nrepresentations of the corresponding $L^\\infty$-spaces.
