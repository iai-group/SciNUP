Galaxy morphology is found to depend critically on the local\nenvironment set up by the nearest neighbor galaxy in addition to luminosity and\nthe large scale density. When a galaxy is located farther than the virial\nradius from its closest neighbor, the probability for the galaxy to have an\nearly morphological type is an increasing function only of luminosity and the\nlocal density due to the nearest neighbor ($\\rho_n$). The tide produced by the\nnearest neighbor is thought to be responsible for the morphology transformation\ntoward the early type at these separations. When the separation is less than\nthe virial radius, i.e. when $\\rho_n > \\rho_{\\rm virial}$, its morphology\ndepends also on the neighbor's morphology and the large-scale background\ndensity over a few Mpc scales ($\\rho_{20}$) in addition to luminosity and\n$\\rho_n$. The early type probability keeps increasing as $\\rho_n$ increases if\nits neighbor is an early type. But the probability decreases as $\\rho_n$\nincreases when the neighbor is a late type.

The impacts of interaction on galaxy properties are detected at\nleast out to the neighbor separation corresponding to the virial radius of\ngalaxies, which is typically between 200 and 400 h^{-1}kpc for the galaxies in\nour sample. To detect these long-range interaction effects it is crucial to\ndivide galaxy interactions into four cases dividing the morphology of target\nand neighbor galaxies into early and late types. We show that there are two\ncharacteristic neighbor-separation scales where the galaxy interactions cause\nabrupt changes in the properties of galaxies. The first scale is the virial\nradius of the nearest neighbor galaxy r_{vir,nei}. Many physical parameters\nstart to deviate from those of extremely isolated galaxies at the projected\nneighbor separation r_p of about r_{vir,nei}.

For DM particles decoupling NR, sqrt{m T_d} results in the keV scale (T_d\nis the decoupling temperature) and the m value is consistent with the keV\nscale.

In the non-linear regime the kink amplitude\ncontinues to increase up to the terminal simulation time, albeit at different\nrates, for all but one simulation. The growth rate and nonlinear evolution of\nthe CD kink instability depends moderately on the density profile and strongly\non the magnetic pitch profile. The growth rate of the kink mode is reduced in\nthe linear regime by an increase in the magnetic pitch with radius and the\nnon-linear regime is reached at a later time than for constant helical pitch.\nOn the other hand, the growth rate of the kink mode is increased in the linear\nregime by a decrease in the magnetic pitch with radius and reaches the\nnon-linear regime sooner than the case with constant magnetic pitch.

Two versions of the\nmodel are studied, one with non-thermal DM as the origin of the boost factor\nand one with Sommerfeld enhancement. In the case of non-thermal DM, four hidden\nsector scalars which transform under a U(1)_{X} symmetry are added. The\nheaviest scalars decouple and later decay to DM scalars, so providing the boost\nfactor necessary to explain the present DM annihilation rate. The mass of the\nannihilating scalars is limited to < 600 GeV for the model to remain\nperturbative. U(1)_{X} breaking to Z_2 at the electroweak transition mixes\nlight O(100) MeV hidden sector scalars with the Higgs.

We discuss the possibility and theoretical aspects\nof using Lyman alpha emission properties of long GRB host galaxies as a\nmetallicity indicator of high redshift GRB environments, where direct\nmetallicity measurements are not easy. We propose to use the fraction of\nLy-alpha emitters (LAEs) in long GRB host galaxies as a function of UV\nluminosity, which can be compared with star-formation-rate weighted LAE\nfraction of Lyman-break galaxies as the standard in the case of no metallicity\ndependence. There are two important effects of metallicity dependence of long\nGRB rate to change the LAE fraction of host galaxies. One is the enhancement of\nintrinsic Ly-alpha equivalent width (EW) by stronger ionizing UV luminosity of\nlow metallicity stellar population, and the other is extinction by interstellar\ndust to change the observable EW. Based on a latest theoretical model of LAEs\nthat reproduce observations, we argue that the latter is likely to work in the\nopposite direction to the former, i.e., to decrease LAE fraction if GRBs\npreferentially occur in low-metallicity environments, because of the clumpy\ninter-stellar medium effect.

We identify three zones\ndistinguished by polarized emission properties: the disc, the halo, and a\ntransition region connecting them. The halo section lies at latitudes |b| >\n40-deg and has weak and smooth polarized emission mostly at large scale with\nsteep angular power spectra of median slope $\\beta_{\\rm med} \\sim -2.6$.

The transition region has steep spectra as in the\nhalo, but the emission increases toward the Galactic plane from halo to disc\nlevels.

We find that the predicted epicyclic overdensities arise in any\ntidal tail no matter which orbit the cluster follows as long as the cluster\nlives long enough for the overdensities to build up.\n  The distance of the overdensities along the tidal tail from the cluster\ncentre depends for circular orbits only on the mass of the cluster and the\nstrength of the tidal field, and therefore decreases monotonically with time,\nwhile for eccentric orbits the orbital motion influences the distance, causing\na periodic compression and stretching of the tails and making the distance\noscillate with time. We provide an approximation for estimating the distance of\nthe overdensities in this case.\n  We describe an additional type of overdensity which arises in extended tidal\ntails of clusters on eccentric orbits, when the acceleration of the tidal field\non the stellar stream is no longer homogeneous. Moreover, we conclude that a\npericentre passage or a disk shock is not the direct origin of an overdensity\nwithin a tidal tail. Escape due to such tidal perturbations does not take place\nimmediately after the perturbation but is rather delayed and spread over the\norbit of the cluster.

The entropy profiles are robustly measured at least out to\nR_1000 in all systems and out to R_500 in 13 systems. Compared to theoretical\nexpectations, the observed distributions show a radial and mass-dependent\nexcess entropy that is greater and extends to larger radii in lower mass\nsystems. At R_500, the mass dependence and entropy excess are both negligible\nwithin the uncertainties. Mirroring this behaviour, the scaling of gas entropy\nis shallower than self-similar in the inner regions, but steepens with radius,\nbecoming consistent with self-similar at R_500. The dispersion in scaled\nentropy in the inner regions is linked to the presence of cool cores and\ndynamical activity; at larger radii the dispersion decreases by a factor of two\nand the dichotomy between subsamples disappears. Parameterising the profiles\nwith a power law plus constant model, there are two peaks in central entropy\nK_0; however, we cannot distinguish between a bimodal or a left-skewed\ndistribution. The outer slopes are correlated with system temperature; their\ndistribution is unimodal with a median value of 0.98.

These \"Lyman Break\nAnalogs\" (LBAs) provide an excellent training set for understanding starbursts\nat different redshifts. We present an application of this by comparing the\nrest-frame UV/optical morphologies of 30 LBAs with those of sBzK galaxies at\nz~2, and LBGs at z~3-4 in the HUDF. The UV/optical colors and sizes of LBAs and\nLBGs are very similar, while the BzK galaxies are somewhat redder and larger.\nThere is significant overlap between the morphologies (G, C, A and M_20) of the\nlocal and high-z samples, although the latter are somewhat less concentrated\nand clumpier.

Our\ndata set consists of 238 clusters drawn from the ROSAT All-Sky Survey, and\nincorporates extensive follow-up observations using the Chandra X-ray\nObservatory. Here we present improved constraints on departures from General\nRelativity (GR) on cosmological scales, using the growth index, gamma, to\nparameterize the linear growth rate of cosmic structure. Using the method of\nMantz et al. (2009a), we simultaneously and self-consistently model the growth\nof X-ray luminous clusters and their observable-mass scaling relations,\naccounting for survey biases, parameter degeneracies and systematic\nuncertainties. We combine the cluster growth data with gas mass fraction, SNIa,\nBAO and CMB data. This combination leads to a tight correlation between gamma\nand sigma_8. Consistency with GR requires gamma~0.55. Under the assumption of\nself-similar evolution and constant scatter in the scaling relations, and for a\nflat LCDM model, we measure gamma(sigma_8/0.8)^6.8=0.55+0.13-0.10, with\n0.79<sigma_8<0.89. Relaxing the assumptions on the scaling relations by\nintroducing two additional parameters to model possible evolution in the\nnormalization and scatter of the luminosity-mass relation, we obtain consistent\nconstraints on gamma that are only ~20% weaker than those above. Allowing the\ndark energy equation of state, w, to take any constant value, we simultaneously\nconstrain the growth and expansion histories, and find no evidence for\ndepartures from either GR or LCDM.

We vary\nthe mass ratio of the progenitors, their rotation axes, and their orbital\nparameters and analyze the kinematic, structural, and chemical properties of\nthe remnants. Six of these simulations result in the formation of a merger\nremnant with a disc morphology as a result of the large gas-fraction of the\nremnants. We show that stars formed during the merger (a sudden starburst occur\nin our simulation and last for 0.2-0.3 Gyr) and those formed after the merger\nhave different kinematical and chemical properties. The first ones are located\nin thick disc or the halo. They are partially supported by velocity dispersion\nand have high [alpha/Fe] ratios even at metallicities as high as [Fe/H]=-0.5.\nThe former ones -- the young component -- are located in a thin disc\nrotationally supported and have lower [alpha/Fe] ratios.

Similarly to standard semi-analytical\nmodels we trace galaxies inside dark-matter merger-trees. The formalism\nincludes treatment of feedback, star-formation, cooling, smooth accretion, gas\nstripping in satellite galaxies, and merger-induced star bursts. However,\nunlike in other models, each process is assumed to have an efficiency which\ndepends only on the host halo mass and redshift. This allows us to describe the\nvarious components of the model in a simple and transparent way. By allowing\nthe efficiencies to have any value for a given halo mass and redshift, we can\neasily encompass a large range of scenarios. To demonstrate this point, we\nexamine several different galaxy formation models, which are all consistent\nwith the observational data. Each model is characterized by a different unique\nfeature: cold accretion in low mass haloes, zero feedback, stars formed only in\nmerger-induced bursts, and shutdown of star-formation after mergers. Using\nthese models we are able to examine the degeneracy inherent in galaxy formation\nmodels, and look for observational data that will help to break this\ndegeneracy. We show that the full distribution of star-formation rates in a\ngiven stellar mass bin is promising in constraining the models. We compare our\napproach in detail to the semi-analytical model of De Lucia & Blaizot. It is\nshown that our formalism is able to produce a very similar population of\ngalaxies once the same median efficiencies per halo mass and redshift are being\nused.

It is shown that even without a detailed calculation of the\npressure anisotropy or the heat fluxes, one finds the macroscale dynamics to be\ngenerically unstable to microscale Alfvenically polarized fluctuations. Two\ninstabilities are considered in detail: the parallel firehose instability\n(including the finite-Larmor-radius effects that determine the fastest growing\nmode) and the gyrothermal instability (GTI). The latter is a new result - it is\nshown that a parallel ion heat flux destabilizes Alfvenically polarized\nfluctuations even in the absence of the negative pressure anisotropy required\nfor the firehose. The main conclusion is that both pressure anisotropies and\nheat fluxes trigger plasma microinstabilities and, therefore, their values will\nlikely be set by the nonlinear evolution of these instabilities.

Most of the H-alpha\nemitters show blue colours, but we find some H-alpha emitters on the red\nsequence. The MIR galaxies tend to be systematically redder than the H-alpha\nemitters probably due to heavy dust extinction. Interestingly, the red H-alpha\nemitters and the red MIR galaxies (i.e. dusty red galaxies) are most commonly\nseen in the medium-density environment such as cluster outskirts, groups and\nfilaments, where optical colours of galaxies change.

We use a recent, simple but\nphysically motivated model to interpret the observed spectral energy\ndistributions of the galaxies in this sample in terms of statistical\nconstraints on physical parameters describing the star formation history and\ndust content. The focus on a subsample of 1658 galaxies with highest S/N\nobservations enables us to investigate most clearly several strong correlations\nbetween various derived physical properties of galaxies.

The Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability strips gas from these clouds. If the pressure and the the\nmetallicity of the corona are high enough, the stripped gas causes a similar\nmass of coronal gas to condense in the cloud's wake.

These confirm the existence of a\ncritical ablation rate above which the corona is condensed, and imply that for\nthe likely parameters of the Galactic corona this rate lies near the actual\nablation rate of clouds.

We require that the 3.6 and 4.5 micron\nlight-curves are strongly correlated (r>0.8) and that their joint variance\nexceeds that for all sources with the same magnitude by 2 sigma. We then\nexamine the mid-IR colors of the variable sources and match them with X-ray\nsources from the XBootes survey, radio catalogs, 24 micron-selected AGN\ncandidates, and spectroscopically identified AGNs from the AGN and Galaxy\nEvolution Survey (AGES). Based on their mid-IR colors, most of the variable\nsources are AGNs (76%), with smaller contributions from stars (11%), galaxies\n(6%), and unclassified objects. Most of the stellar, galaxy and unclassified\nsources are false positives. For our standard selection criteria, 11-12% of the\nmid-IR counterparts to X-ray sources, 24 micron-selected AGN candidates and\nspectroscopically identified AGNs show variability. Mid-IR AGN variability can\nbe well described by a single power-law structure function with a power-law\nindex of 0.5 at both 3.6 and 4.5 microns, and an amplitude of 0.1 mag on\nrest-frame time scales of 2 years.

Yet, the presence of a baryonic disc is\nbelieved to alter the shape of the haloes. Here we aim to study how bar\nformation is affected by halo triaxiality and how, in turn, the presence of the\nbar influences the shape of the halo. We perform a set of collisionless N-body\nsimulations of disc galaxies with triaxial dark matter haloes, using elliptical\ndiscs as initial conditions. We study models of different halo triaxialities\nand, to investigate the behaviour of the halo shape in the absence of bar\nformation, we run models with different disc masses, halo concentrations, disc\nvelocity dispersions and also models where the disc shape is kept artificially\naxisymmetric. We find that the introduction of a massive disc causes the halo\ntriaxiality to be partially diluted. Once the disc is fully grown, a strong\nstellar bar develops within the halo that is still non-axisymmetric, causing it\nto lose its remaining non-axisymmetry. In triaxial haloes in which the initial\nconditions are such that a bar does not form, the halo is able to remain\ntriaxial and the circularisation of its shape on the plane of the disc is\nlimited to the period of disc growth. We conclude that part of the\ncircularisation of the halo is due to disc growth, but part must be attributed\nto the formation of a bar. We find that initially circular discs respond\nexcessively to the triaxial potential and become highly elongated. They also\nlose more angular momentum than the initially elliptical discs and thus form\nstronger bars. Because of that, the circularisation that their bars induce on\ntheir haloes is also more rapid. We also analyse halo vertical shapes and\nobserve that their vertical flattenings remain considerable, meaning that the\nhaloes become approximately oblate by the end of the simulations.

In this paper, we propose a new method to\ndeconstruct a polarization map on an incomplete sky in real space into purely\nelectric and magnetic polarization type maps, ${\\mathcal{E}}(\\hat{\\gamma})$ and\n${\\mathcal{B}}(\\hat{\\gamma})$, respectively. The main properties of our\napproach are as follows: Firstly, the fields ${\\mathcal{E}}(\\hat{\\gamma})$ and\n${\\mathcal{B}}(\\hat{\\gamma})$ are constructed in real space with a minimal loss\nof information. This loss of information arises due to the removal of a narrow\nedge of the constructed map in order to remove various numerical errors,\nincluding those arising from finite pixel size. Secondly, this method is fast\nand can be efficiently applied to high resolution maps due to the use of the\nfast spherical harmonics transformation. Thirdly, the constructed fields,\n${\\mathcal{E}}(\\hat{\\gamma})$ and ${\\mathcal{B}}(\\hat{\\gamma})$, are scalar\nfields. For this reason various techniques developed to deal with temperature\nanisotropy maps can be directly applied to analyze these fields. As a concrete\nexample, we construct and analyze an unbiased estimator for the power spectrum\nof the $B$-mode of polarization $C_{\\ell}^{BB}$. Basing our results on the\nperformance of this estimator, we discuss the RGW detection ability of two\nfuture ground-based CMB experiments, QUIET and POLARBEAR. \n\n"}

We derive the formal structure of the\nLPT series expansion, working to arbitrary order in the initial perturbation\namplitude. The factors that regulate LPT convergence are identified by studying\nthe exact, analytic solution expanded according to this formal structure. The\nkey methodology is to complexify the exact solution, demonstrate that it is\nanalytic and apply well-known convergence criteria for power series expansions\nof analytic functions.This analysis fully explains the previously reported\nobservation that LPT fails to predict the evolution of an underdense, open\nregion beyond a certain time. It also implies the existence of other examples,\nincluding overdense, closed regions, for which LPT predictions should also\nfail. We show that this is indeed the case by numerically computing the LPT\nexpansion in these problematic cases. The formal limitations to the validity of\nLPT expansion are considerably more complicated than simply the first\noccurrence of orbit crossings as is often assumed. Evolution to a future time\ngenerically requires re-expanding the solution in overlapping domains that\nultimately link the initial and final times, each domain subject to its own\nconvergence criterion. We demonstrate that it is possible to handle all the\nproblematic cases by taking multiple steps (LPT re-expansion). We characterize\nhow the leading order numerical error for a solution generated by LPT re-\nexpansion varies with the choice of Lagrangian order and of time step size.\nConvergence occurs when the Lagrangian order increases and/or the time step\nsize decreases in a simple, well-defined manner. We develop a recipe for time\nstep control for LPT re-expansion based on these results. \n\n"}

Integral field spectroscopy provides an efficient way of\ndetecting faint galaxies near bright quasars, further providing immediate\nredshift confirmation.

The shape at M*>10^11 M' does not evolve, but below\nM*~10^10.8 M' the MF at high redshift is flat, while in the Local Universe it\nflattens out at lower masses. The population of M* = 10^10.2 - 10^10.8 M'\ngalaxies must have grown significantly between z=0.8 and z=0. We analyze the MF\nof different morphological types (ellipticals, S0s and late-types), and find\nthat also each of them evolves with redshift. All types have proportionally\nmore massive galaxies at high- than at low-z, and the strongest evolution\noccurs among S0 galaxies. Examining the morphology-mass relation (the way the\nproportion of galaxies of different morphological types changes with galaxy\nmass), we find it strongly depends on redshift. At both redshifts, ~40% of the\nstellar mass is in elliptical galaxies. Another ~43% of the mass is in S0\ngalaxies in local clusters, while it is in spirals in distant clusters. To\nexplain the observed trends, we discuss the importance of those mechanisms that\ncould shape the MF.

However, comparing with high-z\nfield samples, we do not find conclusive evidence for such an environmental\nmass segregation.

A\ngeneral problem is how to produce binaries with semi-major axes small enough to\nin significantly less than the Hubble time (t_H), and thus accommodate the\nobservation that these events closely follow episodes of star formation. I\nexplore the possibility that such systems are not binaries at all, but actually\ncoeval, or dynamical formed, triple systems. The tertiary induces Kozai\noscillations in the inner binary, driving it to high eccentricity, and reducing\nits gravitational wave (GW) merger timescale. This effect significantly\nincreases the allowed range of binary period P such that the merger time is\nt_merge < t_H. In principle, Chandrasekhar-mass binaries with P ~ 300 days can\nmerge in < t_H if they contain a prograde solar-mass tertiary at high enough\ninclination. For retrograde tertiaries, the maximum P such that t_merge < t_H\nis yet larger. In contrast, P < 0.3 days is required in the absence of a\ntertiary. I discuss implications of these findings for the production of\ntransients formed via compact object binary mergers. Based on the statistics of\nsolar-type binaries, I argue that many such binaries should be in triple\nsystems affected by the Kozai resonance. If true, expectations for the mHz GW\nsignal from individual sources, the diffuse background, and the foreground for\nGW experiments like LISA are modified.

Abstract: Nearby spiral galaxies show an extremely tight correlation between tracers of\nmolecular hydrogen (H_2) in the interstellar medium (ISM) and tracers of recent\nstar formation, but it is unclear whether this correlation is fundamental or\naccidental. In the galaxies that have been surveyed to date, H_2 resides\npredominantly in gravitationally bound clouds cooled by carbon monoxide (CO)\nmolecules, but in galaxies of low metal content the correlations between bound\nclouds, CO, and H_2 break down, and it is unclear if the star formation rate\nwill then correlate with H_2 or with some other quantity.

The directly measured optical depth \\tau at a given observed\nenergy is found to be constant on average at redshift z > 2, i.e., <\\tau (0.5\nkeV) >_{z > 2} = 0.40+/- 0.02. Such an asymptotic optical depth is expected if\nthe foreground diffuse intergalactic medium (IGM) dominates the absorption\neffect, and if the metallicity of the diffuse IGM reaches ~ 0.2 - 0.4 solar at\nz = 0. To further test the IGM absorption hypothesis, we analyze the 12 highest\nS/N (> 5000 photon) z > 2 quasar spectra from the XMM-Newton archive, which are\nall extremely radio loud (RLQs). The quasar optical depths are found to be\nconsistent with the mean GRB value. The four lowest-z quasars (2 < z < 2.5),\nhowever, do not show significant absorption. The best X-ray spectra of\nradio-quiet quasars (RQQs) at z > 2 provide only upper limits to the\nabsorption, which are still consistent with the RLQs, albeit with much lower\nS/N (< 1000 photons at z ~ 4). Lack of quasar absorption poses a challenge to\nthe smooth IGM interpretation, and could allude to the opacity being rather due\nto the jets in RLQs and GRBs. However, the jet absorbing column would need to\nappear in RLQs only at z > 2.5, and in GRBs to strongly increase with z in\norder to produce the observed tendency to a constant mean \\tau. High X-ray\nspectral resolution can differentiate between an absorber intrinsic to the\nsource that produces discernible spectral lines, and the diffuse IGM that\nproduces significant absorption, but no discrete features. \n\n"}

Cluster formation is governed by processes\nacting on galactic scales, and star cluster disruption is driven by the tidal\nfield. In this paper, we present a self-consistent model for the formation and\nevolution of star cluster populations, for which we combine an N-body/SPH\ngalaxy evolution code with semi-analytic models for star cluster evolution. The\nmodel includes star formation, feedback, stellar evolution, and star cluster\ndisruption by two-body relaxation and tidal shocks. We apply the model by\nsimulating a suite of 9 isolated disc galaxies and 24 galaxy mergers. The\nevolutionary histories of individual clusters in these simulations are\ndiscussed to illustrate how the environment of clusters changes in time and\nspace. The resulting variability of the disruption rate with time and space\naffects the properties of star cluster populations. The combined effect of\nclusters escaping their dense formation sites (`cluster migration') and the\npreferential disruption of clusters residing in dense environments (`natural\nselection') implies that the mean disruption rate of the population decreases\nwith cluster age. This affects the slope of the cluster age distribution, which\nbecomes a function of the star formation rate density. The evolutionary\nhistories of clusters in a galaxy merger vary widely and determine which\nclusters survive the merger. This impacts the age distributions and the\nlocations of the surviving clusters at all times during a merger. We conclude\nthat accounting for the interplay between the formation, disruption, and\norbital histories of clusters enables a more sophisticated interpretation of\nobserved properties of cluster populations, thereby extending the role of\ncluster populations as tracers of galaxy evolution. \n\n"}

One\nprimary result is that apparent morphology does not correlate strongly with\nstellar populations, nor with galaxy structure at this epoch, suggesting a\nchaotic formation history for Hubble types at z > 1.

Redshift\ndependency enters only through the evolution of the main sequence with time.\nUltra deep IRS spectra match these SED trends well and verify that they are\nmostly due to a change in ratio of PAH to LIR rather than continua of hidden\nAGN. Alternatively, we discuss the dependence of nuLnu(8)/LIR on LIR. Same\nnuLnu(8)/LIR is reached at increasingly higher LIR at higher redshift, with\nshifts relative to local by 0.5 and 0.8 dex in log(LIR) at redshifts z~1 and\nz~2. Corresponding SED template calibrations are provided for use if no stellar\nmasses are in hand. For most of those z~2 star forming galaxies that also host\nan AGN, the mid-infrared is dominated by the star forming component. \n\n"}

This is the first detection of a BAL,\nwhich is sometimes seen in powerful quasars with high accretion rates, in a BL\nLac object. The BAL was clearly detected in its spectra of two epochs at a high\nluminosity state taken in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), while it\ndisappeared in three SDSS spectra taken at a low luminosity state. The BAL and\nits variability pattern was also found in its historical multi-epoch spectra in\nthe literature, but has been overlooked previously. In its high resolution\nradio maps, PKS 0138-097 shows a core plus an one-sided parsec-scale jet. The\nBAL variability can be interpreted as follows: The optical emission is\ndominated by the core in a high state and by the jet in a low state, and the\nBAL material is located between the core and jet so that the BAL appears only\nwhen the core is shining. Our discovery suggests that outflows may also be\nproduced in active galactic nuclei at a low accreting state. \n\n"}

The AD produces\nthe ionizing continuum which powers the broad and narrow emission lines. The\nmaximum AD effective temperature is given by Teff=fmax(Mdot/M^2)^1/4, where M\nis the black hole mass, Mdot the accretion rate, and fmax is set by the black\nhole spin a_*. For a low enough value of Mdot/M^2 the AD may become too cold to\nproduce ionizing photons. Such an object will form a lineless quasar. This\noccurs for a local blackbody (BB) AD with a luminosity Lopt=10^46 erg/s for\nM>3.6E9 Msun, when a_*=0, and for M>1.4E10 Msun, when a_*=0.998. Using the AD\nbased Mdot, derived from M and Lopt, and the reverberation based M, derived\nfrom Lopt and the Hbeta FWHM, v, gives Teff \\propto Lopt^-0.13v^-1.45. Thus,\nTeff is mostly set by v. Quasars with a local BB AD become lineless for v>\n8,000 km/s, when a_*=0, and for v> 16,000 km/s, when a_*=0.998. Higher values\nof v are required if the AD is hotter than a local BB. The AD becoming\nnon-ionizing may explain why line emitting quasars with v>10,000 km/s are rare.\nWeak low ionization lines may still be present if the X-ray continuum is\nluminous enough, and such objects may form a population of weak emission line\nquasars (WLQ).

We propose a simple prescription to infer the angular\nbispectrum from the power spectrum of point sources considering independent\npopulations of sources, with or without clustering.

We show\nthat the IR angular bispectrum peaks for squeezed triangles and that the\nclustering of IR sources enhances the bispectrum values by several orders of\nmagnitude at scales l \\sim 100. At 150 GHz the bispectrum of IR sources starts\nto dominate that of radio sources on large angular scales, and it dominates\nover the whole multipole range at 350 GHz.

Roughly 30% of the clusters show radio emission above a flux\nthreshold of 3 mJy within a projected radius of 250 kpc. The radio emission is\npresumably associated with the brightest cluster galaxy. The mechanical jet\npower for each radio source was determined using scaling relations between\nradio power and cavity (mechanical) power determined for nearby clusters,\ngroups, and galaxies with hot atmospheres containing X-ray cavities. The\naverage jet power of the central radio AGN is approximately $2\\times\n10^{44}$\\ergs. We find no significant correlation between radio power, hence\nmechanical jet power, and the X-ray luminosities of clusters in the redshift\nrange 0.1 -- 0.6. This implies that the mechanical heating rate per particle is\nhigher in lower mass, lower X-ray luminosity clusters. The jet power averaged\nover the sample corresponds to an atmospheric heating of approximately 0.2 keV\nper particle within R$_{500}$. Assuming the current AGN heating rate does not\nevolve but remains constant to redshifts of 2, the heating rate per particle\nwould rise by a factor of two.

We designate this region as the star forming (SF) disk, in which metals\nare produced from supernova explosions (SNexp) while at the same time inflows\nare driven by SNexp-excited turbulent viscosity to accrete onto the SMBHs. In\nthis paper, an equation of metallicity governed by SNexp and radial advection\nis established to describe the metal distribution and evolution in the SF disk.\nWe find that the metal abundance is enriched at different rates at different\npositions in the disk, and that a metallicity gradient is set up that evolves\nfor steady-state AGNs. Metallicity as an integrated physical parameter can be\nused as a probe of the SF disk age during one episode of SMBH activity. In the\nSF disk, evaporation of molecular clouds heated by SNexp blast waves\nunavoidably forms hot gas. This heating is eventually balanced by the cooling\nof the hot gas, but we show that the hot gas will escape from the SF disk\nbefore being cooled, and diffuse into the BLRs forming with a typical rate of\n$\\sim 1\\sunmyr$.

The high sensitivity of methanol\noriginates from the interplay between overall rotation and hindered internal\nrotation of the molecule -- i.e. transitions that convert internal rotation\nenergy into overall rotation energy, or vice versa, give rise to an enhancement\nof the sensitivity coefficient, $K_{\\mu}$.

We select only face-on spiral\ngalaxies in order to avoid contamination by light from the disk in the SDSS\nfiber and enabling the robust visual identification of spiral structure.\nOverall, we find that galaxies with larger central stellar velocity\ndispersions, regardless of morphological type, have older ages, higher\nmetallicities, and an increased overabundance of alpha-elements.

From the observed projected two-point cross-correlation function\nwe derive the linear bias and characteristic dark matter (DM) halo masses for\nthe SMGs. We detect clustering in the cross-correlation between SMGs and\ngalaxies at the > 4 sigma level. For the SMG autocorrelation we obtain r_0 =\n7.7 (+1.8,-2.3) h^-1 Mpc, and derive a corresponding DM halo mass of log(M_halo\n[h^-1 M_sun]) = 12.8 (+0.3,-0.5). Based on the evolution of DM haloes derived\nfrom simulations, we show that that the z = 0 descendants of SMGs are typically\nmassive (~2-3 L*) elliptical galaxies residing in moderate- to high-mass groups\n(log(M_halo [h^-1 M_sun]) = 13.3 (+0.3,-0.5). From the observed clustering we\nestimate an SMG lifetime of ~100 Myr, consistent with lifetimes derived from\ngas consumption times and star-formation timescales, although with considerable\nuncertainties. The clustering of SMGs at z ~ 2 is consistent with measurements\nfor optically-selected quasi-stellar objects (QSOs), supporting evolutionary\nscenarios linking starbursts and QSOs. Given that SMGs reside in haloes of\ncharacteristic mass ~ 6 x 10^12 h^-1 M_sun, we demonstrate that the redshift\ndistribution of SMGs can be described remarkably well by the combination of two\neffects: the cosmological growth of structure and the evolution of the\nmolecular gas fraction in galaxies.

Our aim is to determine precisely the abundance distribution of HDO\ntowards the low-mass protostar IRAS16293-2422 and learn more about the water\nformation mechanisms by determining the HDO/H2O abundance ratio. A spectral\nsurvey of the source IRAS16293-2422 was carried out in the framework of the\nCHESS Herschel Key program with the HIFI instrument, allowing the detection of\nnumerous HDO lines. Other transitions have been observed previously with\nground-based telescopes. The spherical Monte Carlo radiative transfer code\nRATRAN was used to reproduce the observed line profiles of HDO by assuming an\nabundance jump. To determine the H2O abundance throughout the envelope, a\nsimilar study was made of the H2-18O observed lines, as the H2O main isotope\nlines are contaminated by the outflows. We derive an inner HDO abundance of\n1.7e-7 and an outer HDO abundance of 8e-11. To reproduce the HDO absorption\nlines, it is necessary to add an absorbing layer in front of the envelope.

We show that cooling of high-velocity,\nshocked winds in AGN is in fact inefficient in a wide range of circumstances,\nincluding conditions relevant to ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs),\nresulting in energy-conserving outflows. We further show that fast\nenergy-conserving outflows can tolerate a large amount of mixing with cooler\ngas before radiative losses become important. For winds with initial velocity\nv_in>~10,000 km s^-1, as observed in ultra-violet and X-ray absorption, the\nshocked wind develops a two-temperature structure. While most of the thermal\npressure support is provided by the protons, the cooling processes operate\ndirectly only on the electrons. This significantly slows down inverse Compton\ncooling, while free free cooling is negligible. Slower winds with v_in~1,000 km\ns^-1, such as may be driven by radiation pressure on dust, can also experience\nenergy-conserving phases but under more restrictive conditions.

Abstract: Recently, tentative evidence for an excess of gamma rays at energies around\n130 GeV has been reported from analyses of data from the Fermi Large Area\nTelescope (LAT). The excess is potentially of great interest, as it could be\nassociated with the pair-annihilation of Galactic dark matter and the\nsubsequent production of monochromatic or internal bremsstrahlung gamma rays.\nThe 130 GeV excess appears when an optimized selection of the target region of\ninterest is employed, a procedure that depends upon the assumed dark matter\ndensity profile. For the profiles producing an appreciable signal, these target\nregions vastly overlap with the region corresponding to the so-called \"Fermi\nbubbles\". We argue that the tentative evidence for a line feature is likely due\nto hard photons in the Fermi bubbles regions, where the gamma-ray spectrum\ncontains a spectral break in the energy range of interest (100-150 GeV).\nAlthough the origin of this broken power-law is unclear, it is probably related\nto standard astrophysical processes and not to dark matter annihilation. A\nbroken power-law provides as good a fit as a line \"excess\", even within small\nenergy windows, and a significantly better fit for large energy windows. \n\n"}

Physics of the hot gas in the Coma\n  cluster Abstract: We present an analysis of Planck satellite data on the Coma Cluster observed\nvia the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect. Planck is able, for the first time, to detect\nSZ emission up to r ~ 3 X R_500. We test previously proposed models for the\npressure distribution in clusters against the azimuthally averaged data. We\nfind that the Arnaud et al. universal pressure profile does not fit Coma, and\nthat their pressure profile for merging systems provides a good fit of the data\nonly at r<R_500: by r=2XR_500 it underestimates the observed y profile by a\nfactor of ~2. This may indicate that at these larger radii either i) the\ncluster SZ emission is contaminated by unresolved SZ sources along the line of\nsight or ii) the pressure profile of Coma is higher at r>R_500 than the mean\npressure profile predicted by the simulations. The Planck image shows\nsignificant local steepening of the y profile in two regions about half a\ndegree to the west and to the south-east of the cluster centre. These features\nare consistent with the presence of shock fronts at these radii, and indeed the\nwestern feature was previously noticed in the ROSAT PSPC mosaic as well as in\nthe radio. Using Planck y profiles extracted from corresponding sectors we find\npressure jumps of 4.5+0.4-0.2 and 5.0+1.3-0.1 in the west and southeast,\nrespectively.

Finally, we find\nthat the y and radio-synchrotron signals are quasi-linearly correlated on Mpc\nscales with small intrinsic scatter.

We find that this leads to an increasing\ndepolarization towards longer wavelengths and to wavelength dependent RM\nvalues.

We apply this\nformalism to test particles undergoing radial motion relative to comoving\nobservers in expanding Robertson-Walker cosmologies, and include previously\nunpublished results on Fermi coordinates for a class of inflationary\ncosmologies. We compare relative velocities to each other, and show how pairs\nof them determine geometric properties of the spacetime, including the scale\nfactor with sufficient data. Necessary and sufficient conditions are given for\nthe existence of superluminal recessional Fermi speeds in general\nRobertson-Walker cosmologies. We conclude with a discussion of expansion of\nspace. \n\n"}

Although modern simulations of galaxy formation can resolve scales of\n10-100 pc, star formation and feedback operate on smaller, \"subgrid\" scales.\nGreat care should therefore be taken in order to properly account for the\neffect of feedback on global galaxy evolution. We investigate the momentum and\nenergy budget of feedback during different stages of stellar evolution, and\nstudy its impact on the interstellar medium using simulations of local star\nforming regions and galactic disks at the resolution affordable in modern\ncosmological zoom-in simulations. In particular, we present a novel subgrid\nmodel for the momentum injection due to radiation pressure and stellar winds\nfrom massive stars during early, pre-supernova evolutionary stages of young\nstar clusters. Early injection of momentum acts to clear out dense gas in star\nforming regions, hence limiting star formation. The reduced gas density\nmitigates radiative losses of thermal feedback energy from subsequent supernova\nexplosions, leading to an increased overall efficiency of stellar feedback. The\ndetailed impact of stellar feedback depends sensitively on the implementation\nand choice of parameters. Somewhat encouragingly, we find that implementations\nin which feedback is efficient lead to approximate self-regulation of global\nstar formation efficiency. We compare simulation results using our feedback\nimplementation to other phenomenological feedback methods, where thermal\nfeedback energy is allowed to dissipate over time scales longer than the formal\ngas cooling time.

Yet, it\nremains one of the hardest processes to understand when trying to connect\nobservations of stellar and galaxy populations to models of large scale\nstructure formation. The star formation rate at redshifts z > 2 drops off\nrather more quickly than was thought even five years ago. Theoretical models\nhave tended to overpredict the star formation rate at these high redshifts\nsubstantially, primarily due to overcooling. Overcooling in galaxies typically\noccurs because of unphysical radiative cooling. As a result, insufficient\nturbulence is driven by stellar feedback. I show that such turbulence has the\nnet effect of strongly inhibiting star formation, despite its ability to\nlocally promote star formation by compression. Radiation pressure appears less\nlikely to be a dominant driver of the turbulence than has been argued, but\nsupernova and magnetorotational instabilities remain viable. Gravity alone\ncannot be the main driver, as otherwise well-resolved models without feedback\nwould accurately predict star formation rates. Star formation rate surface\ndensity correlates well with observed molecular gas surface density, as well as\nwith other tracers of high density material. Correlation does not, however,\nimply causation. It appears that both molecule formation and star formation\noccur as a consequence of gravitational collapse, with molecules not essential\nin cooling. The basic concept that gravitational instability drives star\nformation remains a true guide through the thickets of complexity surrounding\nthis topic.

We analyse the\ndisc counterpart to type II spicules, RBEs, in three high quality datasets from\nCRISP at the SST. In a quiet Sun region at disc centre we find lower Doppler\nvelocities, 15-40km/s, and Doppler widths, 2-15km/s, of RBEs than in earlier\ncoronal hole studies, 30-50km/s and 7-23km/s, respectively. We examine the\nspatial dependence of Doppler velocities and widths along RBE axes and conclude\nthat there is no clear trend over the FOV or in individual RBEs in quiet Sun at\ndisc centre. These differences with previous coronal hole studies are\nattributed to the more varying magnetic field configuration in quiet Sun\nconditions. Using an extremely high cadence dataset allowed us to improve\ngreatly on the determination of lifetimes of RBEs, found to range from 5 to 60s\nwith an average of 30s, as well as the transverse motions in RBEs, with\ntransverse velocities up to 55km/s and averaging 12km/s. Furthermore, our\nmeasurements of the recurrence rates of RBEs provide important new constraints\non coronal heating by spicules. We also see many examples of a sinusoidal wave\npattern in the transverse motion with periods averaging 54s and amplitudes from\n21.5 to 129km, agreeing well with previous studies of wave motion in limb\nspicules. We interpret the appearance of RBEs over their full length within a\nfew seconds as the result of a combination of three kinds of motions as\nreported earlier for spicules. Finally, we look at the temporal connection\nbetween Ha and Ca 8542 RBEs and find Ca 8542 in addition to being located\ncloser to the footpoint also appear before the Ha RBE. This connection supports\nthe idea that heating occurs in spicules and contribute more weight to the\nprominence of spicules as a source for heating and mass loading of the corona. \n\n"}

Abstract: We investigate the large-scale clustering and gravitational interaction of\nbaryons and dark matter (DM) over cosmic time using a set of collisionless\nN-body simulations. Both components, baryons and DM, are evolved from distinct\nprimordial density and velocity power spectra as predicted by early-universe\nphysics. We first demonstrate that such two-component simulations require an\nunconventional match between force and mass resolution (i.e. force softening on\nat least the mean particle separation scale). Otherwise, the growth on any\nscale is not correctly recovered because of a spurious coupling between the two\nspecies at the smallest scales. With these simulations, we then demonstrate how\nthe primordial differences in the clustering of baryons and DM are\nprogressively diminished over time. In particular, we explicitly show how the\nBAO signature is damped in the spatial distribution of baryons and imprinted in\nthat of DM. This is a rapid process, yet it is still not fully completed at low\nredshifts. On large scales, the overall shape of the correlation function of\nbaryons and DM differs by 2% at z = 9 and by 0.2% at z = 0.

The extra\ncomponent is usually assumed to be due to absorbing gas lying within the host\ngalaxy of the GRB itself. There is an apparent correlation between the\nequivalent column density of hydrogen, N(H,intrinsic) (assuming it to be at the\nGRB redshift), and redshift, z, with the few z>6 GRBs showing the greatest\nintrinsic column densities. We investigate the N(H,intrinsic) - z relation\nusing a large sample of Swift GRBs, as well as active galactic nuclei (AGN) and\nquasar samples, paying particular attention to the spectral energy\ndistributions of the two highest redshift GRBs. Various possible sample biases\nand systematics that might produce such a correlation are considered, and we\nconclude that the correlation is very likely to be real. This may indicate\neither an evolutionary effect in the host galaxy properties, or a contribution\nfrom gas along the line-of-sight, in the diffuse intergalactic medium (IGM) or\nintervening absorbing clouds.

The FourStar medium-band filters provide the\nequivalent of R~10 spectroscopy, which cleanly distinguishes between z~7 LBGs\nand brown dwarf stars.

The CH+ and CH in that region are\nradiatively excited by strong far-IR radiation from the adjacent infrared\nsource Her 36 SE. Similarly, the broadening of the DIBs toward Herschel 36 may\nbe due to radiative pumping of closely spaced high-J rotational levels of\nrelatively small, polar carrier molecules.

Observations of polarized radio emission show that large-scale\n(regular) magnetic fields in spiral galaxies are not axisymmetric, but\ngenerally stronger in interarm regions. In some nearby galaxies such as NGC\n6946 they are organized in narrow magnetic arms situated between the material\nspiral arms. Aims. The phenomenon of magnetic arms and their relation to the\noptical spiral arms (the material arms) call for an explanation in the\nframework of galactic dynamo theory. Several possibilities have been suggested\nbut are not completely satisfactory; here we attempt a consistent\ninvestigation. Methods. We use a 2D mean-field dynamo model in the no-z\napproximation and add injections of small-scale magnetic field, taken to result\nfrom supernova explosions, to represent the effects of dynamo action on smaller\nscales. This injection of small scale field is situated along the spiral arms,\nwhere star-formation mostly occurs. Results. A straightforward explanation of\nmagnetic arms as a result of modulation of the dynamo mechanism by material\narms struggles to produce pronounced magnetic arms, at least with realistic\nparameters, without introducing new effects such as a time lag between Coriolis\nforce and {\\alpha}-effect. In contrast, by taking into account explicitly the\nsmall-scale magnetic field that is injected into the arms by the action of the\nstar forming regions that are concentrated there, we can obtain dynamo models\nwith magnetic structures of various forms that can be compared with magnetic\narms. (abbrev). Conclusions. We conclude that magnetic arms can be considered\nas coherent magnetic structures generated by large-scale dynamo action, and\nassociated with spatially modulated small-scale magnetic fluctuations, caused\nby enhanced star formation rates within the material arms. \n\n"}

Obscured AGN selected as\n  infrared power-law galaxies Abstract: Accretion onto SMBH is believed to occur mostly in obscured AGN. Such objects\nare proving rather elusive in surveys of distant galaxies, including those at\nX-ray energies. Our main goal is to determine whether the revised IRAC criteria\nof Donley et al. (2012) (objects with an IR power-law spectral shape), are\neffective at selecting X-ray type-2 AGN. We present the results from the X-ray\nspectral analysis of 147 AGN selected by cross-correlating the highest spectral\nquality ultra-deep XMM-Newton and the Spitzer/IRAC catalogues in the CDF-S.\nConsequently it is biased towards sources with high S/N X-ray spectra. In order\nto measure the amount of intrinsic absorption in these sources, we adopt a\nsimple X-ray spectral model that includes a power-law modified by intrinsic\nabsorption and a possible soft X-ray component. We find 21/147 sources to be\nheavily absorbed but the uncertainties in their obscuring column densities do\nnot allow us to confirm their Compton-Thick nature without resorting to\nadditional criteria. Although IR power-law galaxies are less numerous in our\nsample than IR non-power-law galaxies (60 versus 87 respectively), we find that\nthe fraction of absorbed (N_{H} > 10^{22} cm^{-2}) AGN is significantly higher\n(at about 3 sigma level) for IR-power-law sources ($\\sim$2/3) than for those\nsources that do not meet this IR selection criteria ($\\sim$1/2). This behaviour\nis particularly notable at low luminosities, but it appears to be present,\nalthough with a marginal significance, at all luminosities. We therefore\nconclude that the IR power-law method is efficient in finding X-ray-absorbed\nsources. We would then expect that the long-sought dominant population of\nabsorbed AGN is abundant among IR power-law spectral shape sources not detected\nin X-rays. \n\n"}

The latter process goes in the right\ndirection of decreasing significantly the overall formation of stars.

Instead,\nthe evidence points to low [alpha/Fe] ratios resulting from an initial mass\nfunction (IMF) deficient in the highest mass stars. The critical evidence is\nthe 0.4 dex deficiency of [O/Fe], [Mg/Fe] and other hydrostatic elements,\ncontrasting with the normal trend of r-process [Eu/Fe]r with [Fe/H]. Supporting\nevidence comes from the hydrostatic element (O, Mg, Na, Al, Cu) [X/Fe] ratios,\nwhich are inconsistent with iron added to the Milky Way (MW) disk trends. Also,\nthe ratio of hydrostatic to explosive (Si, Ca, Ti) element abundances suggests\na relatively top-light IMF.

However,\nthis correlation is weak and the remnant fraction can be regarded as a constant\nwhich depends only on the redshift. Therefore, the shape of the stellar mass\nfunction is almost unchanged, but it simply shifts horizontally if the remnant\nmass includes or not. The shift is larger at lower redshift and it reaches\n0.2-dex at z=0 for a Chabrier IMF. Since this causes a systematic difference,\nwe should take care of the definition of the `stellar' mass, when comparing\none's result with others. \n\n"}

The cospatial nature\nof these subcomponents renders them difficult to disentangle using surface\nbrightness (SB) information alone, especially interior to ~20 kpc. Our new\ndecomposition technique combines information from the luminosity function (LF)\nof over 1.5 million bright (20 < m_814W < 22) stars from the Panchromatic\nHubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey, radial velocities of over 5000 red\ngiant branch stars in the same magnitude range from the Spectroscopic and\nPhotometric Landscape of Andromeda's Stellar Halo (SPLASH) survey, and\nintegrated I-band SB profiles from various sources. We use an affine-invariant\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to fit an appropriate toy model to these\nthree data sets. The bulge, disk, and halo SB profiles are modeled as a Sersic,\nexponential, and cored power-law, respectively, and the LFs are modeled as\nbroken power-laws.

We find that the\ndispersion in the growth index parameter remains small enough to distinguish\nbetween extreme cases of DE models and some commonly used modified gravity\nmodels. The sign of the slope parameter for a redshift dependent growth index\nwas found to be inconsistent as an additional test in extreme cases of DE\nmodels with perturbations. Next, we studied the effect of DE perturbations on\nthe modified growth (MG) parameters that enter the perturbed Einstein\nequations. We find that while the dark energy perturbations affect the MG\nparameters, the deviations remain smaller than those due to modified gravity\nmodels. Additionally, the deviations due to DE perturbations with a non-zero\neffective sound speed occur at scale ranges that are completely different than\nthose due to some modified gravity models such as the $f(R)$ models. In the\ncase of modified gravity models with zero anisotropic stress at late times, the\nsimultaneous determination of the effective dark energy equation of state and\nthe MG parameters can provide the distinction between these models and DE.

We find that out of the five tested galactic parameters,\nmetallicity is the galactic property driving the observed G/D. The G/D versus\nmetallicity relation cannot be represented by a power-law with a slope of -1\nover the whole metallicity range. The observed trend is steeper for\nmetallicities lower than ~ 8.0. A large scatter is observed in the G/D for a\ngiven metallicity, with a dispersion of 0.37 dex in metallicity bins of ~0.1\ndex. The broken power-law reproduces best the observed G/D and provides\nestimates of the G/D that are accurate to a factor of 1.6. The good agreement\nof the G/D and its scatter with the three tested chemical evolution models\nshows that the scatter is intrinsic to galactic properties, reflecting the\ndifferent star formation histories, dust destruction efficiencies, dust grain\nsize distributions and chemical compositions across the sample.

We perform a\nfit to the modulation signal observed in DAMA/LIBRA and show that the allowed\nregion shrinks if Solar gravitational focusing (GF) is included compared to the\none without GF. Furthermore, we consider a possible signal in a generic future\ndirect detection experiment, irrespective of the DAMA/LIBRA signal.

Eight radio source\nsamples are combined to produce a catalogue of 211 radio-loud AGN with\n0.5<z<1.0, which are spectroscopically classified into jet-mode and\nradiative-mode (radiatively-efficient) AGN classes. Comparing with large\nsamples of local radio-AGN from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the cosmic\nevolution of the radio luminosity function of each radio-AGN class is\nindependently derived. Radiative-mode radio-AGN show an order of magnitude\nincrease in space density out to z~1 at all luminosities, consistent with these\nAGN being fuelled by cold gas. In contrast, the space density of jet-mode\nradio-AGN decreases with increasing redshift at low radio luminosities (L_1.4 <\n1e24 W/Hz) but increases at higher radio luminosities.

In addition, these\nsmall-signal measurements can be used in stacking analyses at catalog level.\nThe forced photometry approach has the advantage that we measure a consistent\nset of sources between SDSS and WISE, taking advantage of the resolution and\ndepth of the SDSS images to interpret the WISE images; objects that are\nresolved in SDSS but blended together in WISE still have accurate measurements\nin our photometry.

Despite\nbroad searches, however, no primordial stars have yet been identified. It has\nlong been recognized that the initial metal-free nature of primordial stars\ncould be masked due to accretion of metal-enriched material from the\ninterstellar medium (ISM). Here we point out that while gas accretion from the\nISM may readily occur, the accretion of dust from the ISM can be prevented due\nto the pressure of the radiation emitted from low-mass stars. This implies a\npossible unique chemical signature for stars polluted only via accretion,\nnamely an enhancement in gas phase elements relative to those in the dust\nphase. Using Pop III stellar models, we outline the conditions in which this\nsignature could be exhibited, and we derive the expected signature for the case\nof accretion from the local ISM. Intriguingly, due to the large fraction of\niron depleted into dust relative to that of carbon and other elements, this\nsignature is similar to that observed in many of the so-called carbon-enhanced\nmetal-poor (CEMP) stars.

In order to\ncapture the suppressed growth of neutrino density perturbations on small\nscales, we account for the full momentum dependence of the phase space\ndistribution using the Vlaslov equation, and derive from it a formal\nclosed-form nonlinear equation for the neutrino density. Using a systematic\nperturbative expansion of this equation we compute high-order corrections to\nthe neutrino density contrast without the explicit need to track the perturbed\nneutrino momentum distribution. We calculate the leading-order total matter\nbispectrum for several neutrino masses. Using our result as a benchmark, we\ntest the accuracy of the fluid approximation and a linear approximation used in\nperturbative and N-body analyses, as well as a new hybrid approach that\ncombines the exact linear evolution with the nonlinear structure of the fluid\nequations.

The high-redshift 21-cm\nsignal is dominated by CMB photons that travel freely without interacting with\nthe intervening matter, and hence its late-time ISW signature should correlate\nextremely well with that of the CMB at its peak frequencies. Using the 21-cm\ntemperature brightness instead of the CMB would thus be a further check of the\ndetection of the ISW effect, measured by different instruments at different\nfrequencies and suffering from different systematics.

Properties of the low-metallicity\n  ISM from PACS spectroscopy Abstract: The far-infrared (FIR) lines are key tracers of the physical conditions of\nthe interstellar medium (ISM) and are becoming workhorse diagnostics for\ngalaxies throughout the universe. Our goal is to explain the differences and\ntrends observed in the FIR line emission of dwarf galaxies compared to more\nmetal-rich galaxies. We present Herschel PACS spectroscopic observations of the\nCII157um, OI63 and 145um, OIII88um, NII122 and 205um, and NIII57um\nfine-structure cooling lines in a sample of 48 low-metallicity star-forming\ngalaxies of the guaranteed time key program Dwarf Galaxy Survey. We correlate\nPACS line ratios and line-to-LTIR ratios with LTIR, LTIR/LB, metallicity, and\nFIR color, and interpret the observed trends in terms of ISM conditions and\nphase filling factors with Cloudy radiative transfer models. We find that the\nFIR lines together account for up to 3 percent of LTIR and that star-forming\nregions dominate the overall emission in dwarf galaxies. Compared to metal-rich\ngalaxies, the ratios of OIII/NII122 and NIII/NII122 are high, indicative of\nhard radiation fields. In the photodissociation region (PDR), the CII/OI63\nratio is slightly higher than in metal-rich galaxies, with a small increase\nwith metallicity, and the OI145/OI63 ratio is generally lower than 0.1,\ndemonstrating that optical depth effects should be small on the scales probed.\nThe OIII/OI63 ratio can be used as an indicator of the ionized gas/PDR filling\nfactor, and is found ~4 times higher in the dwarfs than in metal-rich galaxies.\nThe high CII/LTIR, OI/LTIR, and OIII/LTIR ratios, which decrease with\nincreasing LTIR and LTIR/LB, are interpreted as a combination of moderate FUV\nfields and low PDR covering factor. Harboring compact phases of low filling\nfactor and a large volume filling factor of diffuse gas, the ISM of\nlow-metallicity dwarf galaxies has a more porous structure than that in\nmetal-rich galaxies. \n\n"}

This slows down the training by requiring lower\nlearning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously\nhard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this\nphenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing\nlayer inputs.

Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and\nbe less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some\ncases eliminating the need for Dropout.

Incorporating the sCOLA method in\nan N-body code allows one to gain computational speed by capturing the\ngravitational potential from the far field using perturbative techniques, while\nletting the N-body code solve only for the near field. The far and near fields\nare completely decoupled, effectively localizing gravity for the N-body side of\nthe code. Thus, running an N-body code for a small simulation volume using\nsCOLA can reproduce the results of a standard N-body run for the same small\nvolume embedded inside a much larger simulation.

In this case, no flat or falling rotation curve is possible for any\n(barotropic) equation of state with associated sound speed decreasing with\ndensity (a necessary condition if the fluid is to behave as pressureless matter\nat high density). The associated density profile is therefore also incompatible\nwith that inferred in the outer part of clusters.

UCHVCs are sources with velocities and sizes\nconsistent with their being low-mass dwarf galaxies in the Local Volume, but\nwithout optical counterparts in existing catalogs. We are using the WIYN 3.5-m\ntelescope and pODI camera to image these objects and search for an associated\nstellar population. In this paper, we present our observational strategy and\nmethod for searching for resolved stellar counterparts to the UCHVCs. We\ncombine careful photometric measurements, a color-magnitude filter, and spatial\nsmoothing techniques to search for stellar overdensities in the g- and i-band\nimages. We also run statistical tests to quantify the likelihood that whatever\noverdensities we find are real and not chance superpositions of sources. We\ndemonstrate the method by applying it to two data sets: WIYN imaging of Leo P,\na UCHVC discovered by ALFALFA and subsequently shown to be a low-mass\nstar-forming dwarf galaxy in the Local Volume, and WIYN imaging of AGC198606,\nan HI cloud identified by ALFALFA that is near in position and velocity to the\nLocal Group dwarf Leo T. Applying the search method to the Leo P data yields an\nunambiguous detection (>99% confidence) of the galaxy's stellar population.\nApplying our method to the AGC198606 imaging yields a possible detection (92%\nconfidence) of an optical counterpart located ~2.5 arc minutes away from the\ncentroid of AGC198606's HI distribution and within the HI disk. We use the\noptical data to estimate a distance to the stellar counterpart between 373 and\n393 kpc, with an absolute magnitude M_i = -4.67+/-0.09.

The light curves are variable and\nsignificantly correlated between wavebands. Using cross-correlation analysis,\nwe compute the time lag between the X-ray and lower energy bands. These lags\nare thought to be associated with the light travel time between the central\nX-ray emitting region and areas further out on the accretion disc. The computed\nlags support a thermal reprocessing scenario in which X-ray photons heat the\ndisc and are reprocessed into lower energy photons. Additionally, we fit the\nlightcurves using CREAM, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo code for a standard disc.\nThe best-fitting standard disc model yields unreasonably high super-Eddington\naccretion rates. Assuming more reasonable accretion rates would result in\nsignificantly under-predicted lags. If the majority of the reprocessing\noriginates in the disc, then this implies the UV/optical emitting regions of\nthe accretion disc are farther out than predicted by the standard thin disc\nmodel. Accounting for contributions from broad emission lines reduces the lags\nin B and V by approximately 25% (less than the uncertainty in the lag\nmeasurements), though additional contamination from the Balmer continuum may\nalso contribute to the larger than expected lags.

We consider the case of surveys for high-redshift\nLyman-alpha-emitting galaxies (LAEs), which have traditionally been classified\nvia an inferred rest-frame equivalent width (EW) greater than 20 angstrom. Our\nBayesian method relies on known prior probabilities in measured emission-line\nluminosity functions and equivalent width distributions for the galaxy\npopulations, and returns the probability that an object in question is an LAE\ngiven the characteristics observed. This approach will be directly relevant for\nthe Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX), which seeks to\nclassify ~10^6 emission-line galaxies into LAEs and low-redshift [O II]\nemitters. For a simulated HETDEX catalog with realistic measurement noise, our\nBayesian method recovers 86% of LAEs missed by the traditional EW > 20 angstrom\ncutoff over 2 < z < 3, outperforming the EW cut in both contamination and\nincompleteness. This is due to the method's ability to trade off between the\ntwo types of binary classification error by adjusting the stringency of the\nprobability requirement for classifying an observed object as an LAE.

While numerous studies exist to examine its\nvalidity against numerical simulations in a statistical fashion, there are few\nanalyses to compare the TSC dynamics in an individual object-wise basis, which\nis what we attempt in the present paper. We extract 100 halos at z = 0 from a\ncosmological N-body simulation according to the conventional TSC criterion for\nthe spherical over-density. Then we trace back their spherical counter-parts at\nearlier epochs. Just prior to the turn-around epoch of the halos, their\ndynamics is well approximated by TSC, but their turn-around epochs are\nsystematically delayed and the virial radii are larger by ~ 20 percent on\naverage relative to the TSC predictions. We find that this systematic deviation\nis mainly ascribed to the non-uniformity/inhomogeneity of dark matter density\nprofiles and the non-zero velocity dispersions, both of which are neglected in\nTSC. In particular, the inside-out-collapse and shell-crossing of dark matter\nhalos play an important role in generating the significant velocity dispersion.\nThe implications of the present result are briefly discussed. \n\n"}

The radiative feedback from the BH suppresses the cold accretion\nrate to ~1 percent of the Bondi rate when a bulge is not considered.

In particular, we\napply the new formula to apparent horizons of Friedmann expanding universes\nwith zero, negative and positive spatial curvature. As a first result, we found\nthat, apart from the static Einstein solution, the only Friedmann spacetimes\nwith constant (zero) internal energy are the ones with zero spatial curvature.\nThis happens because, in the computation of the internal energy $U$, the\ncontribution due to the non-vanishing Hubble flow must been added to the usual\nMisner-Sharp energy giving, for zero curvature spacetimes, a zero value for\n$U$. This fact does not hold when curvature is present. After analyzing the\nfree energy $F$, we obtain the correct result that $F$ is stationary only for\nphysical systems in isothermal equilibrium, i.e. a de Sitter expanding\nuniverse. This result permits us to trace back a physically reasonable\nhypothesis concerning the origin of the early and late times de Sitter phase of\nour universe. Finally, we deduce an interesting temperature-length inequality\nsimilar to the time-energy uncertainty of ordinary quantum mechanics but with\ntemperature instead of time coordinate.

Despite their\nimportance, a detailed understanding of the physical mechanisms responsible for\nthe driving of these winds is lacking. In an effort to gain more insight into\nthe nature of these flows, we perform global three-dimensional\nmagneto-hydrodynamical simulations of an isolated Milky Way-size starburst\ngalaxy. We focus on the dynamical role of cosmic rays injected by supernovae,\nand specifically on the impact of the streaming and anisotropic diffusion of\ncosmic rays along the magnetic fields. We find that these microphysical effects\ncan have a significant effect on the wind launching and mass loading factors\ndepending on the details of the plasma physics. Due to the cosmic ray streaming\ninstability, cosmic rays propagating in the interstellar medium scatter on\nself-excited Alfven waves and couple to the gas. When the wave growth due to\nthe streaming instability is inhibited by some damping process, such as the\nturbulent damping, the cosmic ray coupling to the gas is weaker and their\neffective propagation speed faster than the Alfven speed. Alternatively, cosmic\nrays could scatter from \"extrinsic turbulence\" that is driven by another\nmechanism. We demonstrate that the presence of moderately super-Alfvenic cosmic\nray streaming enhances the efficiency of galactic wind driving. Cosmic rays\nstream away from denser regions near the galactic disk along partially ordered\nmagnetic fields and, in the process, accelerate more tenuous gas away from the\ngalaxy. For cosmic ray acceleration efficiencies broadly consistent with the\nobservational constraints, cosmic rays reduce the galactic star formation rates\nand significantly aid in launching galactic winds. \n\n"}

Furthermore,\ndirect numerical simulations are typically not able to reach the extreme\nparameters of these processes. For this reason, large-eddy simulations (LES),\nwhich only simulate large and intermediate scales directly, are employed. The\nsmallest, unresolved scales and the interactions between small and large scales\nare introduced by means of a subgrid-scale (SGS) model. We propose and verify a\nnew set of nonlinear SGS closures for future application as an SGS model in LES\nof compressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). We use 15 simulations (without\nexplicit SGS model) of forced, isotropic, homogeneous turbulence with varying\nsonic Mach number $\\mathrm{M_s} = 0.2$ to $20$ as reference data for the most\nextensive \\textit{a priori} tests performed so far in literature. In these\ntests we explicitly filter the reference data and compare the performance of\nthe new closures against the most widely tested closures. These include\neddy-viscosity and scale-similarity type closures with different\nnormalizations. Performance indicators are correlations with the turbulent\nenergy and cross-helicty flux, the average SGS dissipation, the topological\nstructure and the ability to reproduce the correct magnitude and direction of\nthe SGS vectors. We find that only the new nonlinear closures exhibit\nconsistently high correlations (median value \\textgreater$0.8$) with the data\nover the entire parameter space and outperform the other closures in all tests.\nMoreover, we show that these results are independent of resolution and chosen\nfilter scale. Additionally, the new closures are effectively coefficient-free\nwith a deviation of less than $20\\%$. \n\n"}

These analyses are sensitive\nenough to detect contaminations of small intensity like primary and secondary\nCMB anisotropies. Our methodology uses the MF, widely employed to study\nnon-Gaussianities in CMB data, and asserts Gaussian deviations only when all of\nthem points out an exceptional $\\chi^2$ value, at more than $2.2 \\sigma$\nconfidence level, in a given sky patch.

Velocity estimates within the intracluster medium (ICM) can be\nobtained via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect, but its observation is\nchallenging both in term of sensitivity requirement and control of systematic\neffects, including the removal of contaminants. In this paper we report\nresolved observations, at 150 and 260 GHz, of the SZ effect toward the triple\nmerger MACS J0717.5+3745 (z=0.55), using data obtained with the NIKA camera at\nthe IRAM 30m telescope. Assuming that the SZ signal is the sum of a thermal\n(tSZ) and a kinetic (kSZ) component and by combining the two NIKA bands, we\nextract for the first time a resolved map of the kSZ signal in a cluster. The\nkSZ signal is dominated by a dipolar structure that peaks at -5.1 and +3.4\nsigma, corresponding to two subclusters moving respectively away and toward us\nand coincident with the cold dense X-ray core and a hot region undergoing a\nmajor merging event. We model the gas electron density and line-of-sight\nvelocity of MACS J0717.5+3745 as four subclusters.

We consider controlled\nsimulations of isolated (non-cosmological) galaxies but also a limited set of\ncosmological \"zoom-in\" simulations. Although simulations have shown significant\neffects from these physics with weak or absent stellar feedback, the effects\nare much weaker than those of stellar feedback when the latter is modeled\nexplicitly. The additional physics have no systematic effect on galactic star\nformation rates (SFRs) . In contrast, removing stellar feedback leads to SFRs\nbeing over-predicted by factors of $\\sim 10 -100$. Without feedback, neither\ngalactic winds nor volume filling hot-phase gas exist, and discs tend to\nrunaway collapse to ultra-thin scale-heights with unphysically dense clumps\ncongregating at the galactic center.

If the strong force were\nslightly weaker, deuterium would not be stable, and many authors have noted\nthat nuclesynthesis would be compromised so that helium production could not\nproceed through standard reaction chains. Motivated by the possibility that\nother regions of space-time could have different values for the fundamental\nconstants, this paper considers stellar evolution in universes without stable\ndeuterium and argues that such universes can remain habitable. Even in\nuniverses with no stellar nucleosynthesis, stars can form and will generate\nenergy through gravitational contraction. We show that such stars can be\nsufficiently luminous and long-lived to support life. Stars with initial masses\nthat exceed the Chandrasekhar mass cannot be supported by degeneracy pressure\nand explode at the end of their contraction phase. The resulting explosive\nnucleosynthesis can provide the universe with some heavy elements. We also\nexplore the possibility that helium can be produced in stellar cores through a\ntriple-nucleon reaction (roughly analogous to the triple-alpha reaction). Next\nwe show that with even trace amounts of heavy elements --- produced through the\ntriple-nucleon process or by explosive nucleosynthesis --- the CNO cycle can\noperate and allow stars to function. Finally, we consider Big Bang\nNucleosynthesis without stable deuterium and find that only trace amounts of\nhelium are produced, with even smaller abundances of other nuclei. With stars\nevolving through gravitational contraction, explosive nucleosynthesis, the\ntriple-nucleon reaction, and the CNO cycle, universes with no stable deuterium\nare thus potentially habitable, contrary to many previous claims. \n\n"}

Nonlinear numerical evolutions of initial data\nsets extracted from our approximate solutions support the validity of our\napproach. Arbitrarily large lifetimes are still possible, although for the\nparameter space that we analyze in this paper they seem to decay faster than\nthe quasi-bound states.

We use a new radio\nsurvey of the Bo\\\"otes field at 150 MHz made with the Low Frequency Array\n(LOFAR) to select a sample of radio sources. We identify 44 radio galaxies and\n16 quasars with powers $P>10^{25.5}$ W Hz$^{-1}$ at 150 MHz using cross-matched\nmulti-wavelength information from the AGN and Galaxy Evolution Survey (AGES),\nwhich provides spectroscopic redshifts.

Aims:\nWe investigate the role of radial migration on the light distribution and the\nradial stellar content by comparing the inner colour, age and metallicity\ngradients for galaxies with different SB profiles. We define these inner parts\navoiding the bulge and bar regions and up to around three disc scale-lengths\n(type I, pure exponential) or the break radius (type II, downbending; type III,\nupbending). Methods: We analyse 214 spiral galaxies from the CALIFA survey\ncovering different SB profiles.

Once formed, the BBH inspirals due to gas and\ngravitational-wave drag until tidal forces trigger strong feeding of the BHs\nwith the surrounding stellar-density gas about 10 seconds before merger. The\nresulting giga-Eddington accretion peak launches a jet that breaks out of the\nprogenitor star and drives a powerful outflow that clears the gas from the\norbit of the binary within one second, preserving the vacuum GW waveform in the\nLIGO band.

The bursts can be fitted by the spectral models: For\nGRB101219 the spectrum is consistent with the photosphere occurring below or\nclose to the saturation radius, while for GRB100507 the photosphere position\nrelative to the saturation radius can be determined as a function of time. In\nthe latter case, we find that the photosphere initially occurs in the\nacceleration phase and thereafter transitions into the coasting phase. We also\nfind that this transition occurs at the same time as the change in observed\ncooling behaviour: the temperature is close to constant before the break and\ndecays after. We argue that such a transition can be explained by an increasing\nmass outflow rate. Both analysed bursts thus give strong evidence that the jets\nare (initially) radiation dominated. \n\n"}

A theoretically well-motivated\npossibility is that our observable Universe is a 3+1-dimensional hypersurface,\nor brane, embedded in a higher 4+1-dimensional Anti-de Sitter (AdS$_5$)\nspacetime, in which gravity is the only force which propagates through the\ninfinite bulk space, while other forces are confined to the brane. In these\ntypes of brane-world models, GW and EM signals between two points on the brane\nwould, in general, travel different paths.

Establishing the relationship amongst these sources is critical to\ndetermine the role of each in the energy release and transport processes that\noccur within the flare. In this paper we present a novel method to identify and\ncharacterize each source of hard X-ray emission. The method permits a\nquantitative determination of the most likely number of subsources present, and\nof the relative probabilities that the hard X-ray emission in a given subregion\nof the flare is represented by a complicated multiple source structure or by a\nsimpler single source. We apply the method to a well-studied flare on\n2002~February~20 in order to assess competing claims as to the number of\nchromospheric footpoint sources present, and hence to the complexity of the\nunderlying magnetic geometry/toplogy. Contrary to previous claims of the need\nfor multiple sources to account for the chromospheric hard X-ray emission at\ndifferent locations and times, we find that a simple\ntwo-footpoint-plus-coronal-source model is the most probable explanation for\nthe data. We also find that one of the footpoint sources moves quite rapidly\nthroughout the event, a factor that presumably complicated previous analyses.\nThe inferred velocity of the footpoint corresponds to a very high induced\nelectric field, compatible with those in thin reconnecting current sheets. \n\n"}

Spinning dust is one variety of AME that\ncould be partially polarized and therefore relevant for ongoing and future\ncosmic microwave background polarization studies. The Planck satellite mission\nidentified candidate AME regions in approximately $1^\\circ$ patches that were\nfound to have spectra generally consistent with spinning dust grain models. The\nspectra for one of these regions, G107.2+5.2, was also consistent with\noptically thick free-free emission because of a lack of measurements between 2\nand 20 GHz. Follow-up observations were needed. Therefore, we used the C-band\nreceiver (4 to 8 GHz) and the VEGAS spectrometer at the Green Bank Telescope to\nconstrain the AME mechanism. For the study described in this paper, we produced\nthree band averaged maps at 4.575, 5.625, and 6.125 GHz and used aperture\nphotometry to measure the spectral flux density in the region relative to the\nbackground.

There are two main\ncontributing processes. 1) Lower mass galaxies are less rotationally supported.\nThis is confirmed observationally from the skewness of linewidths in bins of HI\nmass in both ALFALFA and HIPASS observations. 2) The HI distributions are less\nextended (relative to the dark matter halo) in dwarf galaxies. Coupled to the\nlower baryon-to-halo ratio results in rotation curves that are still rising at\nthe last measured data point, in agreement with observations from SPARC.\nCombining these two effects, in both simulations and observations lower mass\ngalaxies have on average lower W_50 / W_20. Additionally, mass loss driven by\nsupernovae and projection effects (dwarf galaxies are in general not thin\ndisks) further reduce the linewidths.

Under the\nquasi-static approximation, we derive the equation which governs the evolution\nof matter density perturbations, and it is shown that the effective\ngravitational coupling 'constant' acquires an additional contribution due to\nthe non-minimal matter-torsion coupling term. In this way, this result\ngeneralizes those previously obtained for the growth of matter overdensities in\nthe case of minimal $f(T)$ gravity.

For the first type of mimetic\ngravity, the Ricci scalar only couples to the mimetic field and we demonstrate\nthe number of degrees of freedom (DOFs) is three. Then in both Einstein frame\nand Jordan frame, we perform the Hamiltonian analysis for the extended mimetic\ngravity with higher derivatives directly coupled to the Ricci scalar. We show\nthat different from previous studies working at the cosmological perturbation\nlevel, where only three propagating DOFs show up, this generalized mimetic\nmodel, in general, has four DOFs. To understand this discrepancy, we consider\nthe unitary gauge and find out that the number of DOFs reduces to three. We\nconclude that the reason why this system looks peculiar is that the Dirac\nmatrix of all secondary constraints becomes singular in the unitary gauge,\nresulting in extra secondary constraints and thus reducing the number of DOFs.\nFurthermore, we give a simple example of a dynamic system to illustrate how\ngauge choice can affect the number of secondary constraints as well as the DOFs\nwhen the rank of the Dirac matrix is gauge dependent. \n\n"}

Abstract: Only star clusters that are sufficiently compact and massive survive largely\nunharmed beyond 10 Myr. However, their compactness means a high stellar density\nwhich can lead to strong gravitational interactions between the stars. As young\nstars are often initially surrounded by protoplanetary disks and later on\npotentially by planetary systems, the question arises to what degree these\nstrong gravitational interactions influence planet formation and the properties\nof planetary systems. Here, we perform simulations of the evolution of compact\nhigh-mass clusters like Trumpler 14 and Westerlund 2 from the embedded to the\ngas-free phase and study the influence of stellar interactions. We concentrate\non the development of the mean disk size in these environments. Our simulations\nshow that in high-mass open clusters $80-90\\%$ of all disks/planetary systems\nshould be smaller than 50 AU just due to the strong stellar interactions in\nthese environments. Already in the initial phases, 3-4 close fly-bys lead to\ntypical disk sizes within the range of 18-27 AU. Afterwards, the disk sizes are\naltered only to a small extent. Our findings agree with the recent observation\nthat the disk sizes in the once dense environment of the Upper Scorpio OB\nassociation, NGC~2362, and h/$\\chi$Persei are at least three times smaller in\nsize than, for example, in Taurus. We conclude that the observed planetary\nsystems in high-mass open clusters should also be on average smaller than those\nfound around field stars; in particular, planets on wide orbits are expected to\nbe extremely rare in such environments. \n\n"}

Tracing these\nformer nuclei of stripped galaxies provides a unique way to track the assembly\nhistory of a galaxy or galaxy cluster. In this paper we present a new method to\nestimate how many UCDs host an SMBH in their center and thus are stripped\ngalaxy nuclei. We revisit the dynamical mass measurements that suggest many\nUCDs have more mass than expected from stellar population estimates, which\nrecent observations have shown is due to the presence of an SMBH. We revise the\nstellar population mass estimates using a new empirical relation between the\nmass-to-light ratio (M/L) and metallicity, and use this to predict which UCDs\nare most likely to host an SMBH. This enables us to calculate the fraction of\nUCDs that host SMBHs across their entire luminosity range for the first time.\nWe then apply the SMBH occupation fraction to the observed luminosity function\nof UCDs and estimate that in the Fornax and Virgo cluster alone there should be\n$69^{+32}_{-25}$ stripped nuclei with SMBHs. This analysis shows that stripped\nnuclei with SMBHs are almost as common in clusters as present-day galaxy\nnuclei. We estimate the local SMBH number density in stripped nuclei to\n$3-8\\times10^{-3}Mpc^{-3}$, which represents a significant fraction (10-40\\%)\nof the SMBH density in the local Universe. These SMBHs hidden in stripped\nnuclei will increase expected event rates for tidal disruption events and\nSMBH-SMBH and SMBH-BH mergers.

We develop a\ndetailed numerical simulation to investigate inflationary preheating when the\npotential of the inflaton is a power-law function with arbitrary power index.\nTo achieve a successful graceful exit from a primordial inflationary phase to a\nsmooth, oscillatory phase during preheating, we assume the inflaton potential\nreduces to a quadratic function in the infrared regime, which may be regarded\nas a mass term at low energy scales. With this simplification, our numerical\nmethod may be applied to unconventional chaotic inflation models. To\ndemonstrate its validity, we numerically analyze the preheating stage of\naxion-monodromy inflation which is inspired by string theory. By performing\nperturbation analyses, our result shows that the power spectrum of primordial\ncurvature perturbation can be dominated by fluctuations of entropy field rather\nthan those of inflaton, which can be regarded as a particular realization of\nthe curvaton mechanism through a preheating process. \n\n"}

Prior ground-based observations show\n2MASS 1553+1532AB to be a common proper motion binary. The properties of these\nsystems - low multiplicity fraction (11[+7][-3]% resolved, as corrected for\nsample selection baises), close projected separations (a = 1.8-5.0 AU) and\nnear-unity mass ratios - are consistent with previous results for field brown\ndwarf binaries. Three of the binaries have components that span the\npoorly-understood transition between L dwarfs and T dwarfs. Spectral\ndecomposition analysis of one of these, SDSS 1021-0304AB, reveals a peculiar\nflux reversal between its components, as its T5 secondary is ~30% brighter at\n1.05 and 1.27 micron than its T1 primary. This system, 2MASS 0518-2828AB and\nSDSS 1534+1615AB all demonstrate that the J-band brightening observed between\nlate-type L to mid-type T dwarfs is an intrinsic feature of this spectral\ntransition, albeit less pronounced than previously surmised. We also find that\nthe resolved binary fraction of L7 to T3.5 dwarfs is twice that of other L and\nT dwarfs, an anomaly that can be explained by a relatively rapid evolution of\nbrown dwarfs through the L/T transition, perhaps driven by dynamic\n(nonequilibrium) depletion of photospheric condensates. \n\n"}

The Silicate-Graphite-PAH\n  Model in the Post-Spitzer Era Abstract: Infrared (IR) emission spectra are calculated for dust composed of mixtures\nof amorphous silicate and graphitic grains, including varying amounts of\npolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) particles. The models are constrained to\nreproduce the average Milky Way extinction curve. The calculations include the\neffects of single-photon heating.

The causal structure of\nspacetime on the brane is altered; it is described not by the usual metric\n$g_{\\mu\\nu}$, but instead by the open string metric, that incorporates the\nelectromagnetic background, $G_{\\mu\\nu} = g_{\\mu\\nu} - (2\\pi \\alpha^\\prime)^2\n(F^2)_{\\mu\\nu}$. The speed of light is now slower when propagating along\ndirections transverse to electromagnetic fields or an NS-NS two form, so that\nLorentz invariance is explicitly broken. A generalized equivalence principle\nguarantees that the propagation of {\\it all} particles, not just photons, (with\nthe exception of gravitons) is slower in these transverse directions. We\ndescribe a variety of astrophysical and laboratory-based experiments designed\nto detect the predicted variations in the causal structure. We show that\ncurrent technology cannot probe beyond open string lengths of $10^{-13}$ cm,\ncorresponding to MeV string scales. We also point out that in a braneworld\nscenario, constraints on large scale electromagnetic fields together with a\nmodest phenomenological bound on the NS-NS two-form naturally lead to a bound\non the scale of canonical noncommutativity that is two orders of magnitude\nbelow the string length. By invoking theoretical constraints on the NS-NS\ntwo-form this bound can be improved to give an extremely strong bound on the\nnoncommutative scale well below the Planck length, $\\sqrt{|\\theta|_{max}} <\n10^{-35} {\\rm cm} \\times ({{\\rm TeV} \\over {\\rm string} {\\rm scale}} \n\n"}

We show that the\nDGLAP $Q^2$ evolution of fragmentation functions (FF) to $Q=M_X$ (mass of the X\nparticle) from their initial values at low $Q$ is subject to considerable\nuncertainties. We therefore argue that, for $x\\lsim 0.1$ (the $x$ region of\ninterest for most large $M_X$ values of interest, $x\\equiv 2E/M_X$ being the\nscaled energy variable), the FF obtained from DGLAP evolution is no more\nreliable than that provided, for example, by a simple Gaussian form (in the\nvariable $\\ln(1/x)$) obtained under the Modified Leading Log Approximation\n(MLLA). Additionally, we find that for $x\\gsim0.1$, the evolution in $Q^2$ of\nthe singlet FF, which determines the injection spectrum, is ``minimal'' -- the\nsinglet FF changes by barely a factor of 2 after evolving it over $\\sim$ 14\norders of magnitude in $Q\\sim M_X$. We, therefore, argue that as long as the\nmeasurement of the UHECR spectrum above $\\sim10^{20}\\ev$ is going to remain\nuncertain by a factor of 2 or larger, it is good enough for most practical\npurposes to directly use any one of the available initial parametrisations of\nthe FFs in the $x$ region $x\\gsim0.1$ based on low energy data even without\nevolving them to the requisite $Q^2$ value. \n\n"}

{"id": "hep-ph/9908403", "contents": "Title: Preheating and Supergravity Abstract: In this talk recent developments of the theory of preheating after inflation\nare briefly reviewed. In inflationary cosmology, the particles constituting the\nUniverse are created after inflation due to their interaction with moving\ninflaton field(s) in the process of reheating. In inflationary models motivated\nby supergravity, both bosons and fermions are created. In the bosonic sector,\nthe leading channel of particle production is the non-perturbative regime of\nparametric resonance dominated by those bosons which are created exponentially\nfast with the largest characteristic exponent. In the fermionic sector, the\nleading channel corresponds to the regime of parametric excitation of fermions,\nwhich respects Pauli blocking but differs significantly from the perturbative\nexpectation. In supergravity we also have to consider production of gravitinos\nand moduli fields, which are cosmologically dangerous relics. We discuss the\nderivation of the gravitino equations in curved space-time with moving\nbackground scalars. We describe recent results on the production of gravitinos\nfrom preheating, which may put strong constraints on the inflationary models. \n\n"}
