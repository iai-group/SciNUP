Issues such as J/Psi\nsuppression and hydrodynamical flow in A+A collisions require data from\nLHC-Ions for an improved understanding. Suppression of high pT particles in\nAu+Au collisions, first observed at RHIC, also has unresolved mysteries such as\nthe equality of the suppression of inclusive pi0 (from light quarks and gluons)\nand direct-single electrons (from the decay of heavy quarks) in the transverse\nmomentum range 4< pT < 9 GeV/c.

The advantages of such a hybrid\napproach lie in the improved capability of handling large dissipative\ncorrections in the late dilute phase of the reaction, including a realistic\ntreatment of the non-equilibrium hadronic chemistry and kinetic freeze-out. By\nvarying the switching temperature at which the hydrodynamic output is converted\nto particles for further propagation with the Boltzmann cascade we test the\nability of the macroscopic hydrodynamic approach to emulate the microscopic\nevolution during the hadronic stage and extract the temperature dependence of\nthe effective shear viscosity of the hadron resonance gas produced in the\ncollision. We find that the extracted values depend on the prior hydrodynamic\nhistory and hence do not represent fundamental transport properties of the\nhadron resonance gas. We conclude that viscous fluid dynamics does not provide\na faithful description of hadron resonance gas dynamics with predictive power,\nand that both components of the hybrid approach are needed for a quantitative\ndescription of the fireball expansion and its freeze-out. \n\n"}

This anisotropy is characterized via a Fourier expansion of the\ndistribution of charged particles in azimuthal angle (phi), with the\ncoefficients v_n denoting the magnitude of the anisotropy. Significant v_2-v_6\nvalues are obtained as a function of transverse momentum (0.5<pT<20 GeV),\npseudorapidity (|eta|<2.5) and centrality using an event plane method. The v_n\nvalues for n>=3 are found to vary weakly with both eta and centrality, and\ntheir pT dependencies are found to follow an approximate scaling relation,\nv_n^{1/n}(pT) \\propto v_2^{1/2}(pT). A Fourier analysis of the charged particle\npair distribution in relative azimuthal angle (Dphi=phi_a-phi_b) is performed\nto extract the coefficients v_{n,n}=<cos (n Dphi)>. For pairs of charged\nparticles with a large pseudorapidity gap (|Deta=eta_a-eta_b|>2) and one\nparticle with pT<3 GeV, the v_{2,2}-v_{6,6} values are found to factorize as\nv_{n,n}(pT^a,pT^b) ~ v_n(pT^a)v_n(pT^b) in central and mid-central events. Such\nfactorization suggests that these values of v_{2,2}-v_{6,6} are primarily due\nto the response of the created matter to the fluctuations in the geometry of\nthe initial state. A detailed study shows that the v_{1,1}(pT^a,pT^b) data are\nconsistent with the combined contributions from a rapidity-even v_1 and global\nmomentum conservation.

The aim is a complete description of particle\nproduction at all transverse momentum ($p_{t}$) scales. In this picture, the\nhard initial scatterings result in mainly longitudinal flux tubes, with\ntransversely moving pieces carrying the $p_{t}$ of the partons from hard\nscatterings. These flux tubes constitute eventually both bulk matter (which\nthermalizes and flows) and jets. We introduce a criterion based on parton\nenergy loss to decide whether a given string segment contributes to the bulk or\nleaves the matter to end up as a jet of hadrons. Essentially low $p_{t}$\nsegments from inside the volume will constitute the bulk, high $p_{t}$ segments\n(or segments very close to the surface) contribute to the jets. The latter ones\nappear after the usual flux tube breaking via q-qbar production (Schwinger\nmechanism). Interesting is the transition region: Intermediate $p_{t}$ segments\nproduced inside the matter close to the surface but having enough energy to\nescape, are supposed to pick up q-qbar pairs from the thermal matter rather\nthan creating them via the Schwinger mechanism. This represents a communication\nbetween jets and the flowing bulk matter (fluid-jet interaction). Also very\nimportant is the interaction between jet hadrons and the soft hadrons from the\nfluid freeze-out. We employ the new picture to investigate Pb-Pb collisions at\n2.76 TeV.

This paper explores the correlations among harmonic flow\ncoefficients $v_n$ and their phases $\\Phi_n$, and the rapidity fluctuation of\n$v_n$. The study is carried out usin Pb+Pb events generated by the AMPT model\nwith fixed impact parameter. The overall ellipticity/triangularity of events is\nvaried by selecting on the eccentricities $\\epsilon_n$ or the magnitudes of the\nflow vector $q_n$ for n=2 and 3, respectively. The responses of the $v_n$, the\nevent-plane correlations, and the rapidity fluctuations, to the change in\n$\\epsilon_n$ and $q_n$ are then systematized. Strong positive correlations are\nobserved among all even harmonics $v_2, v_4$, and $v_6$ (all increase with\n$q_2$), between $v_2$ and $v_5$ (both increase with $q_2$) and between $v_3$\nand $v_5$ (both increase with $q_3$), consistent with the effects of nonlinear\ncollective response. In contrast, an anti-correlation is observed between $v_2$\nand $v_3$ similar to that seen between $\\epsilon_2$ and $\\epsilon_3$. These\ncorrelation patterns are found to be independent of whether selecting on $q_n$\nor $\\epsilon_n$, validating the ability of $q_n$ in selecting the initial\ngeometry.

Such a charge splitting\nis visible in the experimental data reported by the STAR Collaboration.\n  The magnitude of this charge splitting appears to strongly depend on the\nactual distance between the pion emission site (pion at freeze-out) and the\nspectator system. As such, the above electromagnetic effect brings new,\nindependent information on the space-time evolution of pion production in heavy\nion collisions.\n  From the comparison of our present analysis to our earlier studies made for\npions produced at higher rapidity, we formulate conclusions on the rapidity\ndependence of the distance between the pion emission site and the spectator\nsystem.

The pseudodata are generated from the isobar model of the E791\nCollaboration, and are reasonably realistic. We demonstrate that it is feasible\nto analyze the high-quality data within a coupled-channel framework that\ndescribes the final state interaction of D+-> K-pi+pi+ as multiple\nrescatterings of three pseudoscalar mesons through two-pseudoscalar-meson\ninteractions in accordance with the two-body and three-body unitarity. The\ntwo-pseudoscalar-meson interactions are designed to reproduce empirical pi pi\nand pi bar K scattering amplitudes. Furthermore, we also include mechanisms\nthat are beyond simple iterations of the two-body interactions, i.e., a\nthree-meson force, derived from the hidden local symmetry model. A picture of\nhadronic dynamics in D+-> K-pi+pi+ described by our coupled-channel model is\nfound to be quite different from those of the previous isobar-type analyses.\nFor example, we find that the D+-> K-pi+pi+ decay width can get almost\ntriplicated when the rescattering mechanisms are turned on. Among the\nrescattering mechanisms, those associated with the rho(770) bar K0 channel,\nwhich contribute to D+-> K-pi+pi+ only through a channel coupling, give a large\ncontribution, and significantly improve the quality of the fits. The K-pi+\ns-wave amplitude from our analysis is reasonably consistent with those\nextracted from the E791 model independent partial-wave analysis; the hadronic\nrescattering and the coupling to the rho(770) bar K0 channel play a major role\nhere. We also find that the dressed D+ decay vertices have phases, induced by\nthe strong rescatterings, that strongly depend on the momenta of the final\npseudoscalar mesons.

With the emergence of many different\ntransport codes in recent years, it becomes important to estimate their\nrobustness in extracting physics information from experiments. We report on the\nresults of a transport code comparison project. 18 commonly used transport\ncodes were included in this comparison: 9 Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck-type\ncodes and 9 Quantum-Molecular-Dynamics-type codes. These codes have been\nrequired to simulate Au+Au collisions using the same physics input for mean\nfields and for in-medium nucleon-nucleon cross sections, as well as the same\ninitialization set-up, the impact parameter, and other calculational parameters\nat 100 and 400 AMeV incident energy. Among the codes we compare one-body\nobservables such as rapidity and transverse flow distributions. We also monitor\nnon-observables such as the initialization of the internal states of colliding\nnuclei and their stability, the collision rates and the Pauli blocking. We find\nthat not completely identical initializations constitute partly for different\nevolutions. Different strategies to determine the collision probabilities, and\nto enforce the Pauli blocking, also produce considerably different results.\nThere is a substantial spread in the predictions for the observables, which is\nmuch smaller at the higher incident energy. We quantify the uncertainties in\nthe collective flow resulting from the simulation alone as about $30\\%$ at 100\nAMeV and $13\\%$ at 400 AMeV, respectively. We propose further steps within the\ncode comparison project to test the different aspects of transport simulations\nin a box calculation of infinite nuclear matter. This should, in particular,\nimprove the robustness of transport model predictions at lower incident\nenergies where abundant amounts of data are available. \n\n"}

Previous theoretical analyses\nhave shown that the elastic breakup (EBU) mechanism (i.e., projectile breakup\nleaving the target in its ground state) is able to account only for a small\nfraction of the total $\\alpha$ inclusive breakup cross sections, pointing\ntoward the dominance of non-elastic breakup (NEB) mechanisms.\n  Purpose: We aim to provide a systematic study of the $\\alpha$ inclusive cross\nsections observed in nuclear reactions induced by $^{6}$Li projectiles. In\naddition to estimating the total $\\alpha$ singles cross sections, it is our\ngoal to evaluate angular and energy distributions of these $\\alpha$ particles\nand compare with experimental data, when available.\n  Method: We compute separately the EBU and NEB components of the inclusive\nbreakup cross sections. For the former, we use the continuum-discretized\ncoupled-channels (CDCC) method, which treats this mechanism to all orders. For\nthe NEB part, we employ the the model proposed in the eighties by Ichimura,\nAustern and Vincent [Phys. Rev.

However, uncertainties in transport models (or model\ndependence) partly affect the reliability of the extracted result. In the\npresent work, by using the recently measured data of rapidity-dependent flows,\nwe constrain the incompressibility of nuclear matter and analyse the impact of\nmodel uncertainties on the obtained value. The method is based on the newly\nupdated version of the ultrarelativistic quantum molecular dynamics (UrQMD)\nmodel in which the Skyrme potential energy-density functional is introduced.\nThree different Skyrme interactions which give different incompressibilities\nvarying from $K_0$=201 to 271 MeV are adopted. The incompressibility is deduced\nfrom the comparison of the UrQMD model simulations and the FOPI data for\nrapidity-dependent elliptic flow in Au+Au collisions at beam energies\n0.4\\emph{A} - 1.0\\emph{A} GeV. The elliptic flow $v_2$ as a function of\nrapidity $y_0$ can be well described by a quadratic fit $v_2=v_{20} +\nv_{22}\\cdot y_0^2 $. It is found that the quantity $v_{2n}$ defined by\n$v_{2n}=|v_{20}|+|v_{22}|$ is quite sensitive to the incompressibility $K_0$\nand the in-medium nucleon-nucleon cross section, but not sensitive to the slope\nparameter $L$ of the nuclear symmetry energy.

However,\nremaining systematic uncertainties, partly related to the choice of in-medium\nnucleon-nucleon cross sections, are of the same magnitude ($\\pm 40$~MeV).\nOverall, the rapidity dependent elliptic flow supports a soft symmetric-matter\nequation-of-state. \n\n"}

The hypothesis of vanishing of the exotic\ncommutators leads to the system of master equations (ME). Solvability\nconditions of these equations define relations between the complex masses of\nthe nonet and decuplet mesons which, in turn, determine relations between the\nreal masses (mass formulae), as well as between the masses and widths of the\nmesons. Mass formulae are independent of the particle widths. The masses of the\nnonet and decuplet particles obey simple ordering rules. The nonet mixing angle\nand the mixing matrix of the isoscalar states of the decuplet are completely\ndetermined by solution of ME; they are real and do not depend on the widths.\nAll known scalar mesons with the mass smaller than $2000MeV$ (excluding\n$\\sigma(600)$) and one with the mass $2200\\div2400MeV$ belong to two\nmultiplets: the nonet $(a_0(980), K_0(1430), f_0(980), f_0(1710))$ and the\ndecuplet $(a_0(1450), K_0(1950), f_0(1370), f_0(1500), f_0(2200)/f_0(2330))$.\nIt is shown that the famed anomalies of the $f_0(980)$ and $a_0(980)$ widths\narise from an extra \"kinematical\" mechanism, suppressing decay, which is not\nconditioned by the flavor coupling constant.

In particular, the Ultrarelativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics\n(UrQMD) transport model is described in great detail. Based on the same\nprinciples as QMD and RQMD, it incorporates a vastly extended collision term\nwith full baryon-antibaryon symmetry, 55 baryon and 32 meson species. Isospin\nis explicitly treated for all hadrons. The range of applicability stretches\nfrom $E_{lab}< 100$ MeV/nucleon up to $E_{lab}> 200$ GeV/nucleon, allowing for\na consistent calculation of excitation functions from the intermediate energy\ndomain up to ultrarelativistic energies. The main physics topics under\ndiscussion are stopping, particle production and collective flow. \n\n"}

For the Au+Au excitation function a transition from the\nsqueeze-out to an in-plane enhanced emission is consistently described with\nmean field potentials corresponding to one incompressibility. For the Pb (158 A\nGeV) Pb system the elliptic flow prefers in-plane emission both for protons and\npions, the directed flow of protons is opposite to that of the pions, which\nexhibit anti-flow. Strong directed transverse flow is present for protons and\nLambdas in Au (6 A GeV) Au collisions as well. Both for the SPS and the AGS\nenergies the agreement between data and calculations is remarkable. \n\n"}

They can be tested rather soon by\nthe upcoming experiments at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at BNL (RHIC).\nHere I focus on the question whether hadronic observables are sensitive to the\nEquation of State (EOS) in the ultradense matter. A new version of RQMD has\nbeen developed recently in which the EOS can be varied, for instance like the\none observed in lattice gauge studies. It is found that -- somewhat\nparadoxically -- the partial transparency of the two nuclei provides new\navenues to assess the influence of baryon number in hot matter. One of the\nsignals which are most sensitive to the dynamics is the directed flow of\nnucleons. As a function of rapidity it changes its direction three times.\nSurprisingly, even one of the most simple observables -- the average transverse\nmomenta or slopes -- displays some significant sensitivity to the EOS in the\nphase transition region between hadronic and quark matter. \n\n"}

In addition, the Delta J\n= 1 staggering effect (i.e. the relative displacement of the levels with even\nangular momentum J with respect to the levels of the same band with odd J) is\nstudied in molecular bands free from Delta J = 2 staggering (i.e. free from\ninterband interactions/bandcrossings). Bands of YD offer evidence for the\nabsence of any Delta J = 1 staggering effect due to the disparity of nuclear\nmasses, while bands of sextet electronic states of CrD demonstrate that Delta J\n= 1 staggering is a sensitive probe of deviations from rotational behaviour,\ndue in this particular case to the spin-rotation and spin-spin interactions. \n\n"}
