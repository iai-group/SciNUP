Finally, in the ground state, it has been found that each Ni2+\nion traps a hole strongly and that a magnetically ordered state appears. In the\noverdoped regime, on the other hand, it has been found that a Kondo-like state\nis formed around each Ni2+ spin at low temperatures. In conclusion, the ground\nstate of non-superconducting La2-xSrxCu1-yNiyO4 changes upon hole doping from a\nmagnetically ordered state with the strong hole-trapping by Ni2+ to a metallic\nstate with Kondo-like behavior due to Ni2+ spins, and the quantum phase\ntransition is crossover-like due to the phase separation into short-range\nmagnetically ordered and metallic regions. \n\n"}

Comparing to the previously\nknown multi-integral representation or the Dunkl operator formalism for the CS\nwave functions, our method depends on the (upper or lower) triangular nature of\nthe fermion interaction, which is resolved in perturbation theory of the second\nquantized form. The eigenstate is constructed from a multiplet of unperturbed\nstates and the perturbation is of finite order. The full construction is a\nsimilarity transformation from the free fermion theory, in the same spirit as\nthe Landau Fermi liquid theory and the 1d Luttinger liquid theory. That means\nquasi-particles or anyons can be represented in terms of free fermion modes (or\nbosonic modes via bosonization). The method is applicable to other (higher than\none space dimension) systems for which the adiabatic theorem applies. \n\n"}

In fact\nPt-substitution is detrimental to higher Tc, which increases up to 38 K only by\ncharge doping of pure FeAs layers. We point out, that two different negatively\ncharged layers [(FeAs)10]n- and (Pt3+yAs8)m- compete for the electrons provided\nby the Ca2+ ions, which is unique in the field of iron-based superconductors.\nIn the parent compound Ca10(FeAs)10(Pt3As8), no excess charge dopes the\nFeAs-layer, and superconductivity has to be induced by Pt-substitution, albeit\nbelow 15 K.

The c-axis\nthermal expansion coefficient alpha_c is negative from 7 to 300 K, whereas\nalpha_a is positive over this T range. The rho(T) shows metallic character. The\nARPES measurements and band theory confirm the metallic character and in\naddition show the presence of a flat band near the Fermi energy E_F. The band\ncalculations exhibit an extremely sharp peak in the density of states D(E_F)\narising from a flat d_{x^2 - y^2} band. A comparison of the Sommerfeld\ncoefficient of the electronic specific heat with chi(T = 0) suggests the\npresence of strong ferromagnetic itinerant spin correlations which on the basis\nof the Stoner criterion predicts that SrCo2As2 should be an itinerant\nferromagnet, in conflict with the magnetization data.

For\nexample, spin waves are an emergent property for antiferromagnets, but for weak\ncorrelations the normal phase of a (Slater) antiferromagnet is metallic,\nwhereas it is insulating (Heisenberg) for strong correlations. As a function of\ninteraction strength, above the antiferromagnetic phase, the crossover between\na metal and a local moment paramagnetic insulator is described by the Mott\ntransition, whose mean-field theory down to T=0 is best formulated with\ndynamical mean-field theory. A similar situation occurs for superconductors:\ndespite similar emergent properties, there are many differences between both\nkinds of superconductors. Experimental evidence suggests that hole-doped\ncuprates are strongly correlated whereas the correlations are weaker in the\nelectron-doped case, especially near optimal doping.

For large enough ac drives, the particle orbit encircles one or more\npotential maxima of the periodic substrate. In this case, when an additional\nincreasing dc drive is applied in the longitudinal direction, the longitudinal\nvelocity increases in a series of discrete steps that are integer multiples of\nthe lattice constant of the substrate times the frequency. Fractional steps can\nalso occur. These integer and fractional steps correspond to distinct stable\ndynamical orbits. A number of these phases also show a rectification in the\npositive or negative transverse direction where a non-zero transverse velocity\noccurs in the absence of a dc transverse drive. We map out the phase diagrams\nof the regions of rectification as a function of ac amplitude, and find a\nseries of tongues.

Since the self-consistency equation leads to a\nsuperposition of different types of off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO)\ninstead of one type of ODLRO only, it may not handle the vortex problem\nappropriately. A possible resolution is suggested. \n\n"}

We found that, the pairing mechanism\ndominates the magnetization property of superconductivity, and the asymmetry\nenhances the paramagnetism of the system. At the turning point from BCS to\nbreached pairing superconductivity, the Meissner mass squared and spin\nsusceptibility are divergent at zero temperature. In the breached pairing state\ninduced by chemical potential difference and mass difference between the two\nkinds of fermions, the system goes from paramagnetism to diamagnetism, when the\nmass ratio of the two species increases. \n\n"}

The dissipative term turns out to be invariant under a\ngroup of superconformal transformations. When added to the usual kinetic term,\nit provides an example of supersymmetric dissipative quantum mechanics. As a\nby-product of our analysis, an intriguing connection to the homeotic/hybrid\nfermion model, proposed for CPT violation in neutrinos, appears. \n\n"}

We show that the universality classes of stable\nFermi surfaces are classified by K-theory, with the pattern of stability\ndetermined by Bott periodicity. The Atiyah-Bott-Shapiro construction implies\nthat the low-energy modes near a Fermi surface exhibit relativistic invariance\nin the transverse p+1 dimensions. This suggests an intriguing parallel between\nnorelativistic Fermi liquids and D-branes of string theory. \n\n"}
