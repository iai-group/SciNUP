In this three-circuit network, the qubit mediates a geometric\nsecond-order circuit interaction between the otherwise decoupled resonators. In\nthe dispersive regime, it also gives rise to a dynamic second-order\nperturbative interaction. The geometric and dynamic coupling strengths can be\ntuned to be equal, thus permitting to switch on and off the interaction between\nthe two resonators via a qubit population inversion or a shifting of the qubit\noperation point.

We state that the\nevolution of the system can be summarized in terms of two main environmental\ninduced physical phenomena: decoherence and energy activation. In this Thesis,\nwe shall show that the latter is a post-decoherence phenomenon. As the energy\nis an observable, the excitation process can be consider a direct indicator of\nthe system-environment entanglement particularly useful at zero temperature.\n  From other point of view, we shall study different attempts to show the\ndecoherence process in double-slit-like experiments both for charged particles\n(electrons) and for neutral particles with permanent dipole moments. In this\ncontext, we shall show that the interaction between the particles and\ntime-dependent fields induces a time-varying Aharonov phase.

I show that there is minimal bipartite entanglement in a typical\ninstance of the DQC1 circuit and even put an upper bound on the possible amount\nof entanglement. This limited amount of entanglement, however, does not imply\nthat the system is classically simulatable. A matrix product state (MPS)\nalgorithm for a typical instance of the DQC1 system requires exponential\nclassical resources. This exposes a gap between the amount of entanglement and\nthe amount of purely nonclassical correlations in a quantum system. This gap, I\nsuggest, can be filled by quantum discord. I calculate it in a typical instance\nof the DQC1 circuit and find that the amount of discord is a constant fraction\nof the maximum possible discord for a system of that size. This allows an\ninterpretation of quantum discord as the resource that drives mixed-state\nquantum computation. I also study quantum discord as a quantity of independent\ninterest.

We find that the predicted epicyclic overdensities arise in any\ntidal tail no matter which orbit the cluster follows as long as the cluster\nlives long enough for the overdensities to build up.\n  The distance of the overdensities along the tidal tail from the cluster\ncentre depends for circular orbits only on the mass of the cluster and the\nstrength of the tidal field, and therefore decreases monotonically with time,\nwhile for eccentric orbits the orbital motion influences the distance, causing\na periodic compression and stretching of the tails and making the distance\noscillate with time. We provide an approximation for estimating the distance of\nthe overdensities in this case.\n  We describe an additional type of overdensity which arises in extended tidal\ntails of clusters on eccentric orbits, when the acceleration of the tidal field\non the stellar stream is no longer homogeneous.

The participant triangularity characterizes the triangular\nanisotropy of the initial nuclear overlap geometry and arises from\nevent-by-event fluctuations in the participant-nucleon collision points. In\nstudies using a multi-phase transport model (AMPT), a triangular flow signal is\nobserved that is proportional to the participant triangularity and corresponds\nto a large third Fourier coefficient in two-particle azimuthal correlation\nfunctions.

We\ndetect 11 binaries out of 37 Be targets (corresponding to a binary fraction of\n30 +/- 8%) and 10 binaries out of 36 B targets (29 +/- 8%). Further tests\ndemonstrate that the B and Be binary systems are not only similar in frequency\nbut also remarkably similar in terms of binary separations, flux differences\nand mass ratios. We find that any hypotheses invoking binary companions as\nresponsible for the formation of a disk need the companions to be closer than\n20 AU.

Yet, the presence of a baryonic disc is\nbelieved to alter the shape of the haloes. Here we aim to study how bar\nformation is affected by halo triaxiality and how, in turn, the presence of the\nbar influences the shape of the halo. We perform a set of collisionless N-body\nsimulations of disc galaxies with triaxial dark matter haloes, using elliptical\ndiscs as initial conditions. We study models of different halo triaxialities\nand, to investigate the behaviour of the halo shape in the absence of bar\nformation, we run models with different disc masses, halo concentrations, disc\nvelocity dispersions and also models where the disc shape is kept artificially\naxisymmetric. We find that the introduction of a massive disc causes the halo\ntriaxiality to be partially diluted. Once the disc is fully grown, a strong\nstellar bar develops within the halo that is still non-axisymmetric, causing it\nto lose its remaining non-axisymmetry. In triaxial haloes in which the initial\nconditions are such that a bar does not form, the halo is able to remain\ntriaxial and the circularisation of its shape on the plane of the disc is\nlimited to the period of disc growth. We conclude that part of the\ncircularisation of the halo is due to disc growth, but part must be attributed\nto the formation of a bar. We find that initially circular discs respond\nexcessively to the triaxial potential and become highly elongated. They also\nlose more angular momentum than the initially elliptical discs and thus form\nstronger bars. Because of that, the circularisation that their bars induce on\ntheir haloes is also more rapid. We also analyse halo vertical shapes and\nobserve that their vertical flattenings remain considerable, meaning that the\nhaloes become approximately oblate by the end of the simulations.

Recently, however,\nseveral measurement procedures have been proposed in which the Heisenberg limit\nseemed to be surpassed. This led to an extensive debate over the question how\nthe sensitivity scales with the physical resources and the computational\nresources that are used in estimation procedures. Here, we reconcile the\nphysical definition of the relevant resources with the information-theoretical\nscaling in terms of the query complexity of a quantum network. This leads to a\nnovel and ultimate Heisenberg limit that applies to all conceivable measurement\nprocedures. The second result reveals a close relationship between quantum\nmetrology and the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm over continuous-variable quantum\nsystems.

Such a trend requires neutron fluences larger than\nthose so far assumed, as these last would have too few neutrons per iron seed.\nWe suggest that the observed enhancements can be produced by nucleosynthesis in\nAGB stars of low mass (M < 1.5M\\odot), if they release neutrons from the\n^{13}C({\\alpha},n)^{16}O reaction in reservoirs larger by a factor of 4 than\nassumed in more massive AGBs (M > 1.5M\\odot).

{"id": "1204.2547", "contents": "Title: The physics of galactic winds driven by active galactic nuclei Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGN) drive fast winds in the interstellar medium of\ntheir host galaxies. It is commonly assumed that the high ambient densities and\nintense radiation fields in galactic nuclei imply short cooling times, thus\nmaking the outflows momentum-conserving. We show that cooling of high-velocity,\nshocked winds in AGN is in fact inefficient in a wide range of circumstances,\nincluding conditions relevant to ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs),\nresulting in energy-conserving outflows. We further show that fast\nenergy-conserving outflows can tolerate a large amount of mixing with cooler\ngas before radiative losses become important. For winds with initial velocity\nv_in>~10,000 km s^-1, as observed in ultra-violet and X-ray absorption, the\nshocked wind develops a two-temperature structure. While most of the thermal\npressure support is provided by the protons, the cooling processes operate\ndirectly only on the electrons. This significantly slows down inverse Compton\ncooling, while free free cooling is negligible. Slower winds with v_in~1,000 km\ns^-1, such as may be driven by radiation pressure on dust, can also experience\nenergy-conserving phases but under more restrictive conditions. During the\nenergy-conserving phase, the momentum flux of an outflow is boosted by a factor\n~v_in/2v_s by work done by the hot post-shock gas, where v_s is the velocity of\nthe swept-up material. Energy-conserving outflows driven by fast AGN winds\n(v_in~0.1c) may therefore explain the momentum fluxes Pdot>>L_AGN/c of\ngalaxy-scale outflows recently measured in luminous quasars and ULIRGs. Shocked\nwind bubbles expanding normal to galactic disks may also explain the\nlarge-scale bipolar structures observed in some systems, including around the\nGalactic Center, and can produce significant radio, X-ray, and gamma-ray\nemission.

Yet, it\nremains one of the hardest processes to understand when trying to connect\nobservations of stellar and galaxy populations to models of large scale\nstructure formation. The star formation rate at redshifts z > 2 drops off\nrather more quickly than was thought even five years ago. Theoretical models\nhave tended to overpredict the star formation rate at these high redshifts\nsubstantially, primarily due to overcooling. Overcooling in galaxies typically\noccurs because of unphysical radiative cooling. As a result, insufficient\nturbulence is driven by stellar feedback. I show that such turbulence has the\nnet effect of strongly inhibiting star formation, despite its ability to\nlocally promote star formation by compression. Radiation pressure appears less\nlikely to be a dominant driver of the turbulence than has been argued, but\nsupernova and magnetorotational instabilities remain viable. Gravity alone\ncannot be the main driver, as otherwise well-resolved models without feedback\nwould accurately predict star formation rates. Star formation rate surface\ndensity correlates well with observed molecular gas surface density, as well as\nwith other tracers of high density material. Correlation does not, however,\nimply causation. It appears that both molecule formation and star formation\noccur as a consequence of gravitational collapse, with molecules not essential\nin cooling. The basic concept that gravitational instability drives star\nformation remains a true guide through the thickets of complexity surrounding\nthis topic.

To our knowledge, neither\nthose excited molecular lines nor such strongly extended DIBs have previously\nbeen seen in absorption from interstellar gas. These unusual features appear to\narise in a small region near Herschel 36 which contains most of the neutral\ninterstellar material in the sight line. The CH+ and CH in that region are\nradiatively excited by strong far-IR radiation from the adjacent infrared\nsource Her 36 SE. Similarly, the broadening of the DIBs toward Herschel 36 may\nbe due to radiative pumping of closely spaced high-J rotational levels of\nrelatively small, polar carrier molecules. If this picture of excited\nrotational states for the DIB carriers is correct and applicable to most DIBs,\nthe 2.7 degree cosmic microwave background may set the minimum widths (about\n0.35 A) of known DIBs, with molecular processes and/or local radiation fields\nproducing the larger widths found for the broader DIBs.

In recent\nyears, theoretical evidence has been accumulated for both states in favor of a\npredominantly $DK$ and $D^*K$ molecular nature, respectively. However, a direct\nexperimental proof of this hypothesis still needs to be found. Since radiative\ndecays are generally believed to be sensitive to the inner structure of the\ndecaying particles, we study in this work the radiative and strong decays of\nboth the $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$, as well as of their counterparts\nin the bottom sector. While the strong decays are indeed strongly enhanced for\nmolecular states, the radiative decays are of similar order of magnitude in\ndifferent pictures. Thus, the experimental observable that allows one to\nconclusively quantify the molecular components of the $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ and\n$D_{s1}(2460)$ is the hadronic width, and not the radiative one, in\ncontradistinction to common belief.

We consider a hidden sector\ncontaining two stable particles charged under an unbroken $U(1)^{'}$ gauge\nsymmetry, hence featuring dissipative interactions. The massless gauge field\nassociated with this symmetry, the dark photon, can interact via kinetic mixing\nwith the ordinary photon. In fact, such an interaction of strength $\\epsilon\n\\sim 10 ^{-9}$ appears to be necessary in order to explain galactic structure.\nWe calculate the effect of this new physics on Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and its\ncontribution to the relativistic energy density at Hydrogen recombination. We\nthen examine the process of dark recombination, during which neutral dark\nstates are formed, which is important for large-scale structure formation.\nGalactic structure is considered next, focussing on spiral and irregular\ngalaxies. For these galaxies we modelled the dark matter halo (at the current\nepoch) as a dissipative plasma of dark matter particles, where the energy lost\ndue to dissipation is compensated by the energy produced from ordinary\nsupernovae (the core-collapse energy is transferred to the hidden sector via\nkinetic mixing induced processes in the supernova core).

The violation critically depends on\ndetermining which detections are coincident. Because the recorded detection\ntimes have \"jitter\", coincidences cannot be inferred perfectly. In the presence\nof settings-dependent timing errors, this can allow a local-realistic system to\nshow apparent violation--the so-called \"coincidence loophole\".

Given that the timetags\nare recorded for synchronized, fixed observation periods and that the settings\nchoices are random and independent of the source, violation of these\ninequalities unambiguously shows non-classical correlations violating local\nrealism.

Abstract: Measurements of the cosmic ray antiproton spectrum can be used to search for\ncontributions from annihilating dark matter and to constrain the dark matter\nannihilation cross section. Depending on the assumptions made regarding cosmic\nray propagation in the Galaxy, such constraints can be quite stringent. We\nrevisit this topic, utilizing a set of propagation models fit to the cosmic ray\nboron, carbon, oxygen and beryllium data. We derive upper limits on the dark\nmatter annihilation cross section and find that when the cosmic ray propagation\nparameters are treated as nuisance parameters (as we argue is appropriate), the\nresulting limits are significantly less stringent than have been previously\nreported. We also note (as have several previous groups) that simple\nGALPROP-like diffusion-reacceleration models predict a spectrum of cosmic ray\nantiprotons that is in good agreement with PAMELA's observations above ~5 GeV,\nbut that significantly underpredict the flux at lower energies. Although the\ncomplexity of modeling cosmic ray propagation at GeV-scale energies makes it\ndifficult to determine the origin of this discrepancy, we consider the\npossibility that the excess antiprotons are the result of annihilating dark\nmatter.

However,\nphoton loss leads to dephasing during the gate, and any residual entanglement\nbetween the resonator and qubits after the gate leads to decoherence. Here we\nconsider how to shape the drive pulse to minimize these unwanted effects.\nFirst, we review how the gate's entangling and dephasing rates depend on the\nsystem parameters and validate closed-form solutions against direct numerical\nsolution of a master equation. Next, we propose spline pulse shapes that reduce\nresidual qubit-bus entanglement, are robust to imprecise knowledge of the\nresonator shift, and can be shortened by using higher-degree polynomials.\nFinally, we present a procedure that optimizes over the subspace of pulses that\nleave the resonator unpopulated.

We make use of the\nsample of the 100 brightest galaxy clusters discovered in the XXL Survey to\ninvestigate the fraction of baryons in the form of hot gas and stars in the\ncluster population. We measure the gas masses of the detected halos and use a\nmass--temperature relation directly calibrated using weak-lensing measurements\nfor a subset of XXL clusters to estimate the halo mass. We find that the\nweak-lensing calibrated gas fraction of XXL-100-GC clusters is substantially\nlower than was found in previous studies using hydrostatic masses.

Although the conventional single-site\nmean-field (MF) approach successfully predicts the emergence of QPTs, it fails\nto include any entanglement. Here, for the first time, in the framework of a\ncluster MF treatment, we extract the signature of EE in the bosonic\nsuperfluid-insulator transitions. We consider a trimerized Kagome lattice of\ninteracting bosons, in which each trimer is treated as a cluster, and implement\nthe cluster MF treatment by decoupling all inter-trimer hopping. In addition to\nsuperfluid and integer insulator phases, we find that fractional insulator\nphases appear when the tunneling is dominated by the intra-trimer part.

The\nresults are reported in terms of multiparticle correlation observables dubbed\nSymmetric Cumulants. These observables are robust against biases originating\nfrom nonflow effects. The centrality dependence of correlations between the\nhigher order harmonics (the quadrangular $v_4$ and pentagonal $v_5$ flow) and\nthe lower order harmonics (the elliptic $v_2$ and triangular $v_3$ flow) is\npresented. The transverse momentum dependences of correlations between $v_3$\nand $v_2$ and between $v_4$ and $v_2$ are also reported. The results are\ncompared to calculations from viscous hydrodynamics and A Multi-Phase Transport\n({AMPT}) model calculations. The comparisons to viscous hydrodynamic models\ndemonstrate that the different order harmonic correlations respond differently\nto the initial conditions and the temperature dependence of the ratio of shear\nviscosity to entropy density ($\\eta/s$). A small average value of $\\eta/s$ is\nfavored independent of the specific choice of initial conditions in the models.\nThe calculations with the AMPT initial conditions yield results closest to the\nmeasurements.

There are two reasons to test the OB inequality and not the CHSH\ninequality. First of all, the OB inequality is a straightforward consequence to\nthe EPR-argumentation. And only this inequality is related to the EPR-Bohr\ndebate. However, the last statement can be objected by some experts working in\nquantum foundations. Therefore to convince experimenters to perform the\nOB-violation experiment, we prefer to concentrate on the second distinguishing\nfeature of the OB inequality which was emphasized by I. Pitowsky. He pointed\nout that the OB inequality provides a higher degree of violations of\nclassicality than the CHSH inequality. The main problem is that the OB\ninequality is derived under the assumption of perfect (anti-) correlations.\nHowever, the last years were characterized by the amazing development of\nquantum technologies. Nowadays, there exist sources producing with very high\nprobability the pairs of photons in the singlet state. Moreover, the efficiency\nof photon detectors was improved tremendously.

Abstract: Only star clusters that are sufficiently compact and massive survive largely\nunharmed beyond 10 Myr. However, their compactness means a high stellar density\nwhich can lead to strong gravitational interactions between the stars. As young\nstars are often initially surrounded by protoplanetary disks and later on\npotentially by planetary systems, the question arises to what degree these\nstrong gravitational interactions influence planet formation and the properties\nof planetary systems. Here, we perform simulations of the evolution of compact\nhigh-mass clusters like Trumpler 14 and Westerlund 2 from the embedded to the\ngas-free phase and study the influence of stellar interactions. We concentrate\non the development of the mean disk size in these environments. Our simulations\nshow that in high-mass open clusters $80-90\\%$ of all disks/planetary systems\nshould be smaller than 50 AU just due to the strong stellar interactions in\nthese environments. Already in the initial phases, 3-4 close fly-bys lead to\ntypical disk sizes within the range of 18-27 AU. Afterwards, the disk sizes are\naltered only to a small extent.

Tracing these\nformer nuclei of stripped galaxies provides a unique way to track the assembly\nhistory of a galaxy or galaxy cluster.

We revisit the dynamical mass measurements that suggest many\nUCDs have more mass than expected from stellar population estimates, which\nrecent observations have shown is due to the presence of an SMBH. We revise the\nstellar population mass estimates using a new empirical relation between the\nmass-to-light ratio (M/L) and metallicity, and use this to predict which UCDs\nare most likely to host an SMBH. This enables us to calculate the fraction of\nUCDs that host SMBHs across their entire luminosity range for the first time.\nWe then apply the SMBH occupation fraction to the observed luminosity function\nof UCDs and estimate that in the Fornax and Virgo cluster alone there should be\n$69^{+32}_{-25}$ stripped nuclei with SMBHs.

In this paper, we explore the ES of stabilizer codes, which furnish\nexactly solvable models for a plethora of gapped quantum phases of matter.\nStudying the ES for stabilizer Hamiltonians in the presence of arbitrary weak\nlocal perturbations thus allows us to develop a general framework within which\nthe entanglement features of gapped topological phases can be computed and\ncontrasted. In particular, we study models harboring fracton order, both type-I\nand type-II, and compare the resulting ES with that of both conventional\ntopological order and of (strong) subsystem symmetry protected topological\n(SSPT) states. We find that non-local surface stabilizers (NLSS), a set of\nsymmetries of the Hamiltonian which form on the boundary of the entanglement\ncut, act as purveyors of universal non-local features appearing in the\nentanglement spectrum. While in conventional topological orders and fracton\norders, the NLSS retain a form of topological invariance with respect to the\nentanglement cut, subsystem symmetric systems---fracton and SSPT\nphases---additionally show a non-trivial geometric dependence on the\nentanglement cut, corresponding to the subsystem symmetry. This sheds further\nlight on the interplay between geometric and topological effects in fracton\nphases of matter and demonstrates that strong SSPT phases harbour a measure of\nquasi-local entanglement beyond that encountered in conventional SPT phases. We\nfurther show that a version of the edge-entanglement correspondence,\nestablished earlier for gapped two-dimensional topological phases, also holds\nfor gapped three-dimensional fracton models. \n\n"}

The\ndynamical phase accumulated during the evolution of the subspaces, is refocused\nby a spin echo pulse sequence and by setting the delay of transition selective\npulses such that the evolution under the homonuclear coupling makes a complete\n$2\\pi$ rotation. A detailed theoretical explanation of non-adiabatic geometric\nphases in NMR is given, by using single transition operators.

Such a finding is of importance for the\nquantification, understanding and potential exploitation of shared quantum\ncorrelations in continuous variable systems. We discuss how promiscuity\ngradually arises when considering simple families of discrete variable states,\nwith increasing Hilbert space dimension towards the continuous variable limit.\nSuch models are somehow analogous to Gaussian states with asymptotically\ndiverging, but finite squeezing. In this respect, we find that non-Gaussian\nstates (which in general are more entangled than Gaussian states), exhibit also\nthe interesting feature that their entanglement is more shareable: in the\nnon-Gaussian multipartite arena, unlimited promiscuity can be already achieved\namong three entangled parties, while this is impossible for Gaussian, even\ninfinitely squeezed states. \n\n"}

Such a theory should combine mathematical logical concepts with\nquantum mechanics.
