For test functions with restricted support,\nthis is known to be the true for the one- and two-level densities of zeros\nwithin the families studied to date. However, for finite conductor Miller's\nexperimental data reveal an interesting discrepancy from these limiting\nresults. Here we use the L-functions ratios conjectures to calculate the\n1-level density for the family of even quadratic twists of an elliptic curve\nL-function for large but finite conductor. This gives a formula for the leading\nand lower order terms up to an error term that is conjectured to be\nsignificantly smaller. The lower order terms explain many of the features of\nthe zero statistics for relatively small conductor and model the very slow\nconvergence to the infinite conductor limit.\n  However, our main observation is that they do not capture the behaviour of\nzeros in the important region very close to the critical point and so do not\nexplain Miller's discrepancy.

The Riemann hypothesis is shown to be equivalent to an approximate\nfunctional equation of graph zeta functions. The latter holds at all points\nwhere Riemann's zeta function $\\zeta(s)$ is non-zero.

In particular, it includes the development of the study of dormant\nopers, which are opers of a certain sort in positive characteristic. The theory\nof dormant opers (or more generally, opers in positive characteristic) on\npointed stable curves, which has proved to be rather rich and deep, was born in\nthe work of S. Mochizuki, who developed the theory for $\\mathfrak{sl}_2$-opers\nand used it to establish $p$-adic Teichm\\\"{u}ller theory. Some parts of\nMochizuki's work were later extended in the case of proper smooth curves by K.\nJoshi, C. Pauly, and other mathematicians. This manuscript represents an\nadvance in the theory of opers that takes the subject beyond the work of\nMochizuki, Joshi, and Pauly. In particular, we provide general unified\nformulations and the basics of principal bundles and connections defined on\nfamilies of pointed stable curves. The notion of an oper is accordingly\nintroduced in the context of logarithmic algebraic geometry. Some of the\nresults can be regarded as generalizations of results obtained in the\nfundamental work on the geometric Langlands program developed by A. Beilinson\nand V. Drinfeld. We also describe various properties and assertions about\n(dormant) opers, such as duality, comparison with differential operators, and\ncompactification of the moduli space. Our goal is to give an explicit formula,\nconjectured by Joshi, for the generic number of dormant\n$\\mathfrak{sl}_n$-opers. We do so by obtaining a detailed understanding of the\nmoduli space of dormant opers and computing the Gromov-Witten invariants for\nQuot-schemes in characteristic zero. This formula reveals an interaction\nbetween studies in $p$-adic Teichm\\\"{u}ller theory and certain areas of\nmathematics, including Gromov-Witten theory. \n\n"}

In particular, an asymptotic form P_as(n)\nvalid for n towards infinity is obtained analytically using standard techniques\nof quantum statistical mechanics. First, the bosonic partition function of\nprimes, or the generating function of unrestricted prime partitions in number\ntheory, is constructed. Next, the density of states is obtained using the\nsaddle-point method for Laplace inversion of the partition function in the\nlimit of large n. This directly gives the asymptotic number of prime partitions\nP_as(n). The leading term in the asymptotic expression grows exponentially as\nsqrt[n/ln(n)] and agrees with previous estimates. We calculate the\nnext-to-leading order term in the exponent, porportional to ln[ln(n)]/ln(n),\nand show that an earlier result in the literature for its coefficient is\nincorrect.

In the analogy with the development of homological\nalgebra for abelian categories the present paper should be viewed as the\nanalogue of the development of homological algebra for abelian groups. Our\nselected prototype, the category Bmod of modules over the Boolean semifield B\nis the replacement for the category of abelian groups. We show that the\nsemi-additive category Bmod fulfills analogues of the axioms AB1 and AB2 for\nabelian categories. By introducing a precise comonad on Bmod we obtain the\nconceptually related Kleisli and Eilenberg-Moore categories. The latter\ncategory Bmod^s is simply Bmod in the topos of sets endowed with an involution\nand as such it shares with Bmod most of its abstract categorical properties.\nThe three main results of the paper are the following. First, when endowed with\nthe natural ideal of null morphisms, the category Bmod^s is a semi-exact,\nhomological category in the sense of M. Grandis. Second, there is a far\nreaching analogy between Bmod^s and the category of operators in Hilbert space,\nand in particular results relating null kernel and injectivity for morphisms.\nThe third fundamental result is that, even for finite objects of Bmod^s the\nresulting homological algebra is non-trivial and gives rise to a computable Ext\nfunctor.

The conjecture for a regulator map of particular degree and\nweight is related to finiteness of two arithmetic objects: One is the\n$p$-primary torsion part of the Chow group in codimension 2 of $X$. Another is\nan unramified cohomology group of $X$. As an application, for a regular model\n${\\mathscr X}$ of $X$ over the integer ring of $k$, we show an injectivity\nresult on torsion of a cycle class map from the Chow group in codimension 2 of\n${\\mathscr X}$ to a new $p$-adic cohomology of ${\\mathscr X}$ introduced by the\nsecond author, which is a candidate of the conjectural \\'etale motivic\ncohomology with finite coefficients of Beilinson-Lichtenbaum. \n\n"}

We consider the cyclic homology of the\ncokernel (in the abelian category of cyclic modules) of the ``restriction map''\ndefined by the inclusion of the ideles class group of a global field in the\nnoncommutative adeles class space. Weil's explicit formula can then be\nformulated as a Lefschetz trace formula for the induced action of the ideles\nclass group on this cohomology. In this formulation the Riemann hypothesis\nbecomes equivalent to the positivity of the relevant trace pairing. This result\nsuggests a possible dictionary between the steps in the Weil proof and\ncorresponding notions involving the noncommutative geometry of the adeles class\nspace, with good working notions of correspondences, degree and codegree etc.\nIn particular, we construct an analog for number fields of the algebraic points\nof the curve for function fields, realized here as classical points (low\ntemperature KMS states) of quantum statistical mechanical systems naturally\nassociated to the periodic orbits of the action of the ideles class group, that\nis, to the noncommutative spaces on which the geometric side of the trace\nformula is supported. \n\n"}
