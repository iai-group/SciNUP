The model form factor is computed\nusing an exact covariant calculation of the lowest-order triangle diagram and\nshown to be the same as that obtained using light-front techniques. The meaning\nof transverse density is explained using coordinate space variables, allowing\nus to identify a true mean-square transverse size directly related to the form\nfactor. We show that the rest-frame charge distribution is generally not\nobservable because of the failure to uphold current conservation. Neutral\nsystems of two charged constituents are shown to obey the lore that the heavier\none is generally closer to the transverse origin than the lighter one. It is\nargued that the negative central charge density of the neutron arises, in\npion-cloud models, from pions of high longitudinal momentum. The\nnon-relativistic limit is defined precisely and the ratio of the binding energy\nto that of the mass of the lightest constituent is shown to govern the\ninfluence of relativistic effects.

The well-established evolution of the global even-odd\neffect with the fissioning system is found to be only a partial aspect of the\neven-odd structure.

An analysis method is introduced to measure\nnon-flow correlations, relying on the assumption that non-flow correlations are\nmost prominent at short ranges (Delta eta < 2). Assuming that non-flow\ncorrelations are of the order that is observed in p+p collisions for long range\ncorrelations (Delta eta > 2), relative elliptic flow fluctuations of\napproximately 30-40% are observed.

The participant triangularity characterizes the triangular\nanisotropy of the initial nuclear overlap geometry and arises from\nevent-by-event fluctuations in the participant-nucleon collision points. In\nstudies using a multi-phase transport model (AMPT), a triangular flow signal is\nobserved that is proportional to the participant triangularity and corresponds\nto a large third Fourier coefficient in two-particle azimuthal correlation\nfunctions. Using two-particle azimuthal correlations at large pseudorapidity\nseparations measured by the PHOBOS and STAR experiments, we show that this\nFourier component is also present in data.

The measured astrophysical factor\nfor this reaction is dominated by resonant capture through two strong\n$J^{\\pi}=1^{-}$ resonances at $E_{R}= 312$ and 962 keV and direct capture to\nthe ground state. Recently, a new measurement of the astrophysical factor for\nthe $^{15}{\\rm N}(p,\\gamma)^{16}{\\rm O}$ reaction has been published [P. J.\nLeBlanc {\\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. {\\bf C 82}, 055804 (2010)]. The analysis has\nbeen done using the $R$-matrix approach with unconstrained variation of all\nparameters including the asymptotic normalization coefficient (ANC). The best\nfit has been obtained for the square of the ANC $C^{2}= 539.2$ fm${}^{-1}$,\nwhich exceeds the previously measured value by a factor of $\\approx 3$. Here we\npresent a new $R$-matrix analysis of the Notre Dame-LUNA data with the fixed\nwithin the experimental uncertainties square of the ANC $C^{2}=200.34$\nfm${}^{-1}$. Rather than varying the ANC we add the contribution from a\nbackground resonance that effectively takes into account contributions from\nhigher levels. Altogether we present 8 fits, five unconstrained and three\nconstrained. In all the fits the ANC is fixed at the previously determined\nexperimental value $C^{2}=200.34$ fm${}^{-1}$. For the unconstrained fit with\nthe boundary condition $B_{c}=S_{c}(E_{2})$, where $E_{2}$ is the energy of the\nsecond level, we get $S(0)=39.0 \\pm 1.1 $ keVb and normalized ${\\tilde\n\\chi}^{2}=1.84$, i.e. the result which is similar to [P.

Since the anomalous\npeak exists in the dijet-mass region of 140 GeV with the p-pbar center-of-mass\nenergy sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV, a relevant momentum fraction x of partons is roughly\n0.1. In this x region, recent HERMES semi-inclusive charged-lepton scattering\nexperiment indicated that the strange-quark distribution could be very\ndifferent from a conventional one, which has been used for many years, based on\nopposite-sign dimuon measurements in neutrino-induced deep inelastic\nscattering. We investigated effects of such variations in the strange-quark\ndistribution s(x) on the anomaly. We found that distributions of W+dijets and\nother process are affected by the strange-quark modifications in wide\ndijet-mass regions including the 140 GeV one. Since the CDF anomaly was\nobserved in the shoulder region of the dijet-mass distribution, a slight\nmodification of the distribution shape could explain at least partially the CDF\nexcess. Therefore, it is important to consider such effects within the standard\nmodel for judging whether the CDF anomaly indicates new physics beyond the\nstandard model.

Their\nproduction rates provide access to the initial state parton distribution\nfunctions and also provide a means to calibrate the expected energy of jets\nthat are produced in the medium. The ATLAS detector measures photons with its\nhermetic, longitudinally segmented calorimeter, which gives excellent spatial\nand energy resolutions, and detailed information about the shower shape of each\nmeasured photon. This provides significant rejection against the expected\nbackground from the decays of neutral pions in jets. Rejection against jet\nfragmentation products is further enhanced by requiring candidate photons to be\nisolated. First results on the spectra of isolated prompt photons from a\ndataset with an integrated luminosity of approximately 0.13 nb^-1 of lead-lead\ncollisions at sqrt(s_NN)=2.76 TeV are shown as a function of transverse\nmomentum and centrality.

In this compact\nreview we present some clarifications, corrections and further developments of\nthe approach, and provide a brief account of results previously discussed but\nnot reported in the literature. The cross symmetry compound nucleus $S$-matrix\ncorrelations are obtained (i) starting from the unitary $S$-matrix\nrepresentation, (ii) by explicitly taking into account a process of energy\nequilibration, and (iii) without taking the thermodynamic limit of an infinite\nnumber of particles in the thermalized system. It is conjectured that the long\nphase memory is due to the exponentially small total spin off-diagonal\nresonance intensity correlations. This manifestly implies that the strong\nangular asymmetry intimately relates to extremely small deviations of the\neigenfunction distribution from Gaussian law. The spin diagonal resonance\nintensity correlations determine a new time/energy scale for a validity of\nrandom matrix theory. Its definition does not involve overlaps of the many-body\ninteracting configurations with shell model non-interacting states and thus is\nconceptually different from the physical meaning (inverse energy relaxation\ntime) of the spreading widths introduced by Wigner. Exact Gaussian distribution\nof the resonance wave functions corresponds to the instantaneous phase\nrelaxation. We invite the nuclear reaction community for the competition to\ndescribe, as the first challenge, the strong forward peaking in the typically\nevaporation part of the proton spectra. This is necessary to initiate revealing\nlong-term misconduct in the heavily cross-disciplinary field, also important\nfor nuclear industry applications. \n\n"}

As such, they offer a unique view of the nucleus\nthat is often not accessible otherwise. Although interesting in their own\nright, giant resonances are also enormously valuable in providing stringent\nconstraints on the equation of state of asymmetric matter. We this view in\nmind, we focus on two modes of excitation that are essential in reaching this\ngoal: the isoscalar giant monopole resonance (GMR) and the isovector giant\ndipole resonance (GDR). GMR energies in heavy nuclei are sensitive to the\nsymmetry energy because they probe the incompressibility of neutron-rich\nmatter. Unfortunately, access to the symmetry energy is hindered by the\nrelatively low neutron-proton asymmetry of stable nuclei. Thus, the measurement\nof GMR energies in exotic nuclei is strongly encouraged. In the case of the\nGDR, we find the electric dipole polarizability of paramount importance.\nIndeed, the electric dipole polarizability appears as one of two laboratory\nobservables -- with the neutron-skin thickness being the other -- that are\nhighly sensitive to the density dependence of the symmetry energy. Finally, we\nidentify the softness of skin and the nature of the pygmy resonance as\nimportant unsolved problems in nuclear structure. \n\n"}

These model\nelements, whose dependence on relative azimuth angle has the form\n$\\cos[m(\\phi_1-\\phi_2)]$ where $m > 2$, were introduced to support a\nhydrodynamic flow interpretation of the same-side ($|\\phi_1-\\phi_2| < \\pi/2$)\n2D peak in the correlations. Previous studies have shown that the $m > 2$\nharmonics are not required by the data, that they destabilize the fitting\nmodels, and that their net effect is to decompose the same-side peak into two\ncomponents, one being dependent on and the other being independent of relative\npseudorapidity. Thus we are lead to question whether descriptions of angular\ncorrelation data including higher-order harmonics inform our understanding of\nthe same-side peak or heavy-ion collisions in general. Results from analysis of\ntwo-dimensional angular correlation data from the Relativistic Heavy-Ion\nCollider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) show that the RHIC data do\nnot exclude a single-Gaussian hypothesis for the same-side peak. We find that\nthe net effect of including the $m = 3$ harmonic or azimuth sextupole in the\nfitting model is the inclusion of small non-Gaussian dependence in the\nmathematical description of the same-side peak. Those non-Gaussian effects are\nsystematically insignificant and can be accommodated by minor perturbations to\nthe same-side 2D Gaussian peak model, which act locally at small relative\nazimuth. We also demonstrate that the 0-1% 2D angular correlation data for 2.76\nTeV Pb+Pb collisions from ATLAS, which display an away-side double peak on\nazimuth, do not require a sextupole and exclude a positive same-side sextupole. \n\n"}

Suppression predictions of quark and gluon jets appear to suggest a\nclear hierarchy according to which neutral pions should be more suppressed than\nD mesons, which in turn should be more suppressed than single electrons.\nHowever, joint comparison of neutral pion (light probe) and non-photonic single\nelectron (heavy probe) suppression data at RHIC unexpectedly showed similar jet\nsuppression for these two probes, which presents the well-known heavy flavor\npuzzle at RHIC. We here analyze which effects are responsible for this\nunexpected result, by using the dynamical energy loss formalism. We find that\nthe main effect is a surprising reversal in the suppression hierarchy between\nneutral pions and D mesons, which is due to the deformation of the suppression\npatterns of light partons by fragmentation functions. Furthermore, we find\nthat, due to the decay functions, the single electron suppression approaches\nthe D meson suppression.

Systematic calculations with the ImQMD model show that the\nfluctuation-dissipation relation found in the symmetric head-on fusion\nreactions at energies just above the Coulomb barrier fades out when the\nincident energy increases. It turns out that this dynamical change with\nincreasing incident energy is caused by a specific behavior of the friction\nparameter which directly depends on the microscopic dynamical process, i.e., on\nhow the collective energy of the relative motion is transferred into the\nintrinsic excitation energy. It is shown microscopically that the energy\ndissipation in the fusion process is governed by two mechanisms: One is caused\nby the nucleon exchanges between two fusing nuclei, and the other is due to a\nrearrangement of nucleons in the intrinsic system. The former mechanism\nmonotonically increases the dissipative energy and shows a weak dependence on\nthe incident energy, while the latter depends on both the relative distance\nbetween two fusing nuclei and the incident energy.

Meaning,\n  illustrations and consequences Abstract: The concept of single-nucleon shells constitutes a basic pillar of our\nunderstanding of nuclear structure. Effective single-particle energies (ESPEs)\nintroduced by French and Baranger represent the most appropriate tool to relate\nmany-body observables to a single-nucleon shell structure. As briefly discussed\nin [T. Duguet, G. Hagen, Phys. Rev. C {\\bf 85}, 034330 (2012)], the dependence\nof ESPEs on one-nucleon transfer probability matrices makes them purely\ntheoretical quantities that \"run\" with the non-observable resolution scale\n$\\lambda$ employed in the calculation. Given that ESPEs provide a way to\ninterpret the many-body problem in terms of simpler theoretical ingredients,\nthe goal is to specify the terms, i.e. the exact sense and conditions, in which\nthis interpretation can be conducted meaningfully. State-of-the-art\nmulti-reference in-medium similarity renormalization group and self-consistent\nGorkov Green's function many-body calculations are employed to corroborate the\nformal analysis. This is done by comparing the behavior of several observables\nand of non-observable ESPEs (and spectroscopic factors) under (quasi) unitary\nsimilarity renormalization group transformations of the Hamiltonian\nparameterized by the resolution scale $\\lambda$. The non-observable nature of\nthe nuclear shell structure, i.e. the fact that it constitutes an intrinsically\ntheoretical object with no counterpart in the empirical world, must be\nrecognized and assimilated. Eventually, practitioners can refer to nuclear\nshells and spectroscopic factors in their analyses of nuclear phenomena if, and\nonly if, they use consistent structure and reaction theoretical schemes based\non a fixed resolution scale they have agreed on prior to performing their\nanalysis and comparisons. \n\n"}

The measurement of nuclear\nmodification of charged jet spectra in p-Pb collisions provides an important\nway of quantifying the effects of cold nuclear matter in the initial state on\njet production, fragmentation, and hadronization.

In addition to cataclysmic events involving black holes, GWs can\nbe triggered by physical processes and systems involving neutron stars.\nProperties of neutron stars are largely determined by the equation of state\n(EOS) of neutron-rich matter, which is the major ingredient in calculating the\nstellar structure and properties of related phenomena, such as gravitational\nwave emission from elliptically deformed pulsars and neutron star binaries.\nAlthough the EOS of neutron-rich matter is still rather uncertain mainly due to\nthe poorly known density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy at high\ndensities, significant progress has been made recently in constraining the\nsymmetry energy using data from terrestrial nuclear laboratories. These\nconstraints could provide useful information on the limits of GWs expected from\nneutron stars. Here after briefly reviewing our previous work on constraining\ngravitational radiation from elliptically deformed pulsars with terrestrial\nnuclear laboratory data in light of the recent gravitational wave detection, we\nestimate the maximum gravitational wave strain amplitude, using an optimistic\nvalue for the breaking strain of the neutron star crust, for 15 pulsars at\ndistances 0.16 kpc to 0.91 kpc from Earth, and find it to be in the range of\n$\\sim[0.2-31.1]\\times 10^{-24}$, depending on the details of the EOS used to\ncompute the neutron star properties.

Borromean, two-nucleon, halo\nnuclei are candidates of unstable three-fragments projectiles. The model is\nbased on the theory of inclusive breakup reactions commonly employed in the\ntreatment of incomplete fusion and surrogate method. The theory was developed\nin the 80's by Ichimura, Autern and Vincent (IAV) [Phys. Rev. C 32, 431 (1985)]\n\\cite{IAV1985}, Udagawa and Tamura (UT)[Phys. Rev.

We extend these three-body theories to derive an expression for\nthe fragment yield in the reaction $A\\,(a,b)\\,X$, where the projectile is $a =\nx_1 + x_2 + b$. The inclusive breakup cross section is found to be the sum of a\ngeneralized four-body form of the elastic breakup cross section plus the\ninclusive non-elastic breakup cross section which involves the \"reaction\" cross\nsection of the participant fragments, $x_1$ and $x_2$. The final result is\nsimilar to the three-body case reviewed in Austern, et al. (Phys.

These developments should encourage\nexperimentalists to seek more information about the $x_{1} + x_{2}$ system in\nthe elastic breakup cross section, and to theorists to further develop and\nextend the surrogate method, based on the inclusive non-elastic breakup part of\nthe $b$ spectrum. \n\n"}

These processes hold a lot of potential for resolving the outstanding\nissues related to the dynamics of hadronization in QCD. Within the minimal Fock\ncomponent framework, valid at large Bjorken $x$, the main features of the\ntheoretical approach based on the virtual nucleon approximation are elaborated.\nIn this approach, the strong final-state interaction of the DIS products with\nthe nuclear fragments is described by an effective eikonal amplitude, whose\nparameters can be extracted from the analysis of semi-inclusive DIS off the\ndeuteron target. The extraction of the $Q^2$ and $W$ mass dependences of these\nparameters gives a new observable in studying the QCD structure of DIS final\nstates. Another important feature of tagged DIS off the lightest nuclei is the\npossibility of performing pole extrapolation with a high degree of accuracy.\nSuch extrapolation allows an extraction of the neutron structure function in a\nmodel independent way due to suppression of the final-state interaction in the\non-shell limit of the struck nucleon propagator. We review the first\napplication of the pole extrapolation to recent experimental data.

We propose that the ratio of multiplicities of such\nexcited states to the respective $L = 0$ states can serve as an almost model\nindependent signal for the quark-gluon plasma formation in relativistic\nheavy-ion collisions.

These backgrounds, which are difficult to veto or shield against, are\nvery important for solar, reactor, dark matter, and other underground\nexperiments, especially as increased sensitivity is pursued. We used fluka to\ncalculate the production rates and spectra of all prominent secondaries\nproduced by cosmic ray muons, in particular focusing on secondary neutrons, due\nto their importance. Since the neutron spectrum is steeply falling, the total\nneutron production rate is sensitive just to the relatively soft neutrons, and\nnot to the fast-neutron component.

It is demonstrated that the solar flux from\n$^{8}$B decay as measured from the ES reaction rate under the no-oscillation\nassumption is consistent with the high precision ES measurement by the\nSuper-Kamiokande experiment. The $\\nu_{e}$ flux deduced from the CC reaction\nrate in SNO differs from the Super-Kamiokande ES results by 3.3$sigma$. This is\nevidence for an active neutrino component, in additional to $\\nu_{e}$, in the\nsolar neutrino flux. These results also allow the first experimental\ndetermination of the total active $^{8}$B neutrino flux from the Sun, and is\nfound to be in good agreement with solar model predictions. \n\n"}

To which total angular momentum {\\rm L} and {\\rm S}\ncouple has no significant impact on the baryon mass. Nucleons with spin 1/2 are\nshifted in mass; the shift is - in units of squared masses - proportional to\nthe component in the wave function which is antisymmetric in spin and flavor.\nBased on these observations, a new baryon mass formula is proposed which\nreproduces nearly all known baryon masses. It is shown that the masses are\ncompatible with a quark-diquark picture while the richness of the\nexperimentally known states require three particles to participate in the\ndynamics. This conflict is resolved by proposing that quarks polarize the QCD\ncondensates and are surrounded by a polarization cloud shielding the color. A\nnew interpretation of constituent quarks as colored quark clusters emerges;\ntheir interaction is responsible for the mass spectrum. Fast flavor exchange\nbetween the colored quark clusters exhausts the dynamical richness of the\nthree-particle dynamics. The colored-quark-cluster model provides a mechanism\nin which the linear confinement potential can be traced to the increase of the\nvolume in which the condensates are polarized. The quark-spin magnetic moment\ninduces currents in the polarized condensates which absorb the quark-spin\nangular momentum: the proton spin is not carried by quark spins.

Namely,\nparticle production in central Au+Au collisions, when expressed as $dN/d\\eta'$\n($\\eta' \\equiv \\eta-y_{beam}$), becomes energy independent at high energy for a\nbroad region of $\\eta'$ around $\\eta'=0$.

This method, known as spectator tagging, can be used to study\nelectron scattering from high-momentum (off-shell) neutrons in deuterium. The\ndata were taken with a 5.765 GeV electron beam on a deuterium target in\nJefferson Laboratory's Hall B, using the CLAS detector. A reduced cross section\nwas extracted for different values of final-state missing mass $W^{*}$,\nbackward proton momentum $\\vec{p}_{s}$ and momentum transfer $Q^{2}$. The data\nare compared to a simple PWIA spectator model. A strong enhancement in the data\nobserved at transverse kinematics is not reproduced by the PWIA model. This\nenhancement can likely be associated with the contribution of final state\ninteractions (FSI) that were not incorporated into the model. A ``bound neutron\nstructure function'' $F_{2n}^{eff}$ was extracted as a function of $W^{*}$ and\nthe scaling variable $x^{*}$ at extreme backward kinematics, where effects of\nFSI appear to be smaller. For $p_{s}>400$ MeV/c, where the neutron is far\noff-shell, the model overestimates the value of $F_{2n}^{eff}$ in the region of\n$x^{*}$ between 0.25 and 0.6. A modification of the bound neutron structure\nfunction is one of possible effects that can cause the observed deviation. \n\n"}

Hence it\nis important to examine in details uncertainties (and values) of inputs to the\nSSM.

Preceding\ncalculations in chiral effective field theories only employed pion and nucleon\ndegrees of freedom and were not able to reproduce the photon spectrum in the\npioneering experiment of radiative muon capture on the proton from TRIUMF.
