To unify and generalize these various forms we consider P as the most\ngeneral quadratic function of the spin components that vanishes whenever Sa and\nSb are collinear, i.e. we consider the most general expressions that require\nspin canting.

We deduce\nthe k_T- and collinear factorizations for the DIS structure functions by\nconsecutive reductions of a more general theoretical construction. We begin by\nstudying the amplitude of the forward Compton scattering off a hadron target,\nrepresenting this amplitude as a set of convolutions of two blobs connected by\nthe simplest, two-parton intermediate states. Each blob in the convolutions can\ncontain both the perturbative and non-perturbative contributions. We formulate\nconditions for separating the perturbative and non-perturbative contributions\nand attributing them to the different blobs. After that the convolutions\ncorrespond to the QCD factorization. Then we reduce this totally unintegrated\n(basic) factorization first to the k_T- factorization and finally to the\ncollinear factorization. In order to yield a finite expression for the Compton\namplitude, the integration over the loop momentum in the basic factorization\nmust be free of both ultraviolet and infrared singularities. This obvious\nmathematical requirement leads to theoretical restrictions on the\nnon-perturbative contributions (parton distributions) to the Compton amplitude\nand the DIS structure functions related to the Compton amplitude through the\nOptical theorem. In particular, our analysis excludes the use of the singular\nfactors x^{-a} (with a > 0) in the fits for the quark and gluon distributions\nbecause such factors contradict to the integrability of the basic convolutions\nfor the Compton amplitude. This restriction is valid for all DIS structure\nfunctions in the framework of both the k_T- factorization and the collinear\nfactorization if we attribute the perturbative contributions only to the upper\nblob. \n\n"}

At the\nLHC the model predicts net top quark polarization of the order of a few per\ncent for $M_{Z'} \\simeq 1200 $ GeV, being as high as $10 %$ for a smaller mass\nof the $Z'$ of $700$ GeV and for the largest allowed coupling in the model, the\nvalues being higher for the $7$ TeV option. These polarizations translate to a\ndeviation from the standard-model value of azimuthal asymmetry of up to about\n$4%$ ($7%$) for $14$ ($7$) TeV LHC, whereas for the Tevatron, values as high as\n$12%$ are attained. For the $14$ TeV LHC with an integrated luminosity of 10\nfb$^{-1}$, these numbers translate into a $3 \\sigma$ sensitivity over a large\npart of the range $500 \\lesssim M_{Z'} \\lesssim 1500 $ GeV. \n\n"}

The Yukawa couplings of the triplet fermion and the\nleft-handed neutrinos with the doublet Higgs field produce the Dirac mass\nterms. Together with the Majorana masses for the leptonic triplets, the light\nneutrinos obtain non-zero seesaw masses. We point out that it is also possible\nto have a quadruplet Higgs field to produce the Dirac mass terms to facilitate\nthe seesaw mechanism. The vacuum expectation value of the quadruplet Higgs is\nconstrained to be small by electroweak precision data. Therefore the Yukawa\ncouplings of a quadruplet can be much larger than those for a doublet.

In\nthe case of low-background physics, however, a primary concern is the effect on\nthe detector from radioactivity inherent in the detector parts themselves. From\nthis standpoint, there is no single source or beam, but rather a collection of\nsources with potentially complicated spatial extent. LUXSim is a simulation\nframework used by the LUX collaboration that takes a component-centric approach\nto event generation and recording. A new set of classes allows for multiple\nradioactive sources to be set within any number of components at run time, with\nthe entire collection of sources handled within a single simulation run.\nVarious levels of information can also be recorded from the individual\ncomponents, with these record levels also being set at runtime.

We show that a two-Higgs\ndoublet model spectrum, with the pseudo-scalar state being the lightest, could\nbe responsible for the diphoton signal events. In this model, the other scalars\nare considerably heavier and are not excluded by the current LHC data. If this\nassumption is correct, future LHC data should show a strengthening of the\n$\\gamma\\gamma$ signal, while the signals in the $ZZ^{(*)}\\to 4\\ell $ and\n$WW^{(*)}\\to 2\\ell 2\\nu$ channels should diminish and eventually disappear, due\nto the absence of diboson tree-level couplings of the CP-odd state.

We suggest additional signals to confirm\nthis scenario at the LHC, in the decay channels of the heavier scalars into\n$AA$ and $AZ$. Finally, this inverted two-Higgs doublet spectrum is\ncharacteristic in models where fermion condensation leads to electroweak\nsymmetry breaking.

This anisotropy is characterized via a Fourier expansion of the\ndistribution of charged particles in azimuthal angle (phi), with the\ncoefficients v_n denoting the magnitude of the anisotropy. Significant v_2-v_6\nvalues are obtained as a function of transverse momentum (0.5<pT<20 GeV),\npseudorapidity (|eta|<2.5) and centrality using an event plane method. The v_n\nvalues for n>=3 are found to vary weakly with both eta and centrality, and\ntheir pT dependencies are found to follow an approximate scaling relation,\nv_n^{1/n}(pT) \\propto v_2^{1/2}(pT). A Fourier analysis of the charged particle\npair distribution in relative azimuthal angle (Dphi=phi_a-phi_b) is performed\nto extract the coefficients v_{n,n}=<cos (n Dphi)>. For pairs of charged\nparticles with a large pseudorapidity gap (|Deta=eta_a-eta_b|>2) and one\nparticle with pT<3 GeV, the v_{2,2}-v_{6,6} values are found to factorize as\nv_{n,n}(pT^a,pT^b) ~ v_n(pT^a)v_n(pT^b) in central and mid-central events.

The DiFFs are\nextracted as Monte Carlo (MC) averages of corresponding multiplicities using\ntheir probabilistic interpretation. To simplify the model and highlight the\npossible mechanisms that create this modulation, we choose the elementary\nCollins function to be proportional to the elementary unpolarised fragmentation\nand a constant probability ($P_{SF}$) for the quark to flip its spin after a\nsingle hadron emission. Moreover, as a leading order calculation, only one of\nthe produced hadrons in the decay chain of the quark is produced with\nelementary Collins modulation.

Such an explanation faces challenges from the constraints imposed by\nthe $g-2$ of the muon and electron as well as precision spectroscopy of muonic\natoms. In this work we complement the family of constraints by calculating the\ncontribution of hypothetical forces to the muonium hyperfine structure. We also\ncompute the two-loop contribution to the electron parity violating amplitude\ndue to a muon loop, which is sensitive to the muon axial-vector coupling.\nOverall, we find that the combination of low-energy constraints favors the mass\nof the mediator to be below 10 MeV, and that a certain degree of tuning is\nrequired between vector and axial-vector couplings of new vector particles to\nmuons in order to satisfy constraints from muon $g-2$.

In BaOsO3, which shows obvious 3-dimensional\nfermiology, a nonmagnetism is induced by a large spin-orbit coupling (SOC),\nwhich is precisely equal to an exchange splitting ~0.4 eV of the $t_{2g}$\nmanifold. However, the inclusion of on-site Coulomb repulsion as small as\n$U^c$~1.2 eV, only 1/3 of the $t_{2g}$ bandwidth, leads to the emergence of a\nspin-ordered moment, indicating that this system is on the verge of magnetism.\nIn contrast to BaOsO3, our calculations suggest that the ground state of an\northorhombic CaOsO3 is a magnetically ordered state due to the reduction of the\nstrength of SOC (about a half of that of BaOsO3) driven by the structure\ndistortion, although the magnetization energy is only a few tenths of meV.\nFurthermore, in the cubic BaOsO3 and BaRuO3, our full-phonon calculations show\nseveral unstable modes, requiring further research. \n\n"}

The first principles band structures between\nthe I$_{3}$ and SbF$_{6}$ salts are apparently different.

The obtained transfer energies give the differences\nsuch as (i) larger dimerization in the I$_{3}$ salt than the SbF$_{6}$ salt,\nand (ii) different signs and directions of the inter-stacking transfer\nenergies. To decompose the origin of the difference into the dimerization and\nthe inter-stacking transfer energies, we adopt a simplified model by\neliminating the dimerization effect and extract the difference caused by the\ninter-stacking transfer energies. From the analysis using the simplified model,\nwe find that the difference of the band structure comes mainly from the\nstrength of dimerization.

Di-hadron fragmentation functions can be extracted from\nsemi-inclusive electron-positron annihilation data. They also appear in\nobservables describing the semi-inclusive production of two hadrons in\ndeep-inelastic scattering of leptons off nucleons or in hadron-hadron\ncollisions. When a target nucleon is transversely polarized, a specific\nchiral-odd di-hadron fragmentation function can be used as the analyzer of the\nnet density of transversely polarized quarks in a transversely polarized\nnucleon, the so-called transversity distribution. The latter can be extracted\nthrough suitable single-spin asymmetries in the framework of collinear\nfactorization, thus in a much simpler framework with respect to the traditional\none in single-hadron fragmentation. At subleading twist, the same chiral-odd\ndi-hadron fragmentation function provides the cleanest access to the poorly\nknown twist-3 parton distribution $e(x)$, which is intimately related to the\nmechanism of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in QCD. When sensitive to\ndetails of transverse momentum dynamics of partons, the di-hadron fragmentation\nfunctions for a longitudinally polarized quark can be connected to the\nlongitudinal jet handedness to explore possible effects due to $CP-$violation\nof the QCD vacuum. In this review, we outline the formalism of di-hadron\nfragmentation functions, we discuss different observables where they appear and\nwe present measurements and future worldwide plans. \n\n"}

Here we propose an alternative strategy: use a\nQSL as a substrate for heterostructure growth of metallic films to design\nexotic superconductors. By spatially separating the two key ingredients of\nsuperconductivity, i.e., charge carriers (metal) and pairing interaction (QSL),\nthe proposed setup naturally lands on the parameter regime conducive to a\ncontrolled theoretical prediction. Moreover, the proposed setup allows us to\n\"customize\" electron-electron interaction imprinted on the metallic layer. The\nQSL material of our choice is quantum spin ice well-known for its emergent\ngauge-field description of spin frustration. Assuming the metallic layer forms\nan isotropic single Fermi pocket, we predict that the coupling between the\nemergent gauge-field and the electrons of the metallic layer will drive\ntopological odd-parity pairing.

Abstract: In many analyses in high energy physics, attempts are made to remove the\neffects of detector smearing in data by techniques referred to as \"unfolding\"\nhistograms, thus obtaining estimates of the true values of histogram bin\ncontents. Such unfolded histograms are then compared to theoretical\npredictions, either to judge the goodness of fit of a theory, or to compare the\nabilities of two or more theories to describe the data. When doing this, even\ninformally, one is testing hypotheses. However, a more fundamentally sound way\nto test hypotheses is to smear the theoretical predictions by simulating\ndetector response and then comparing to the data without unfolding; this is\nalso frequently done in high energy physics, particularly in searches for new\nphysics. One can thus ask: to what extent does hypothesis testing after\nunfolding data materially reproduce the results obtained from testing by\nsmearing theoretical predictions? We argue that this \"bottom-line-test\" of\nunfolding methods should be studied more commonly, in addition to common\npractices of examining variance and bias of estimates of the true contents of\nhistogram bins.

Localized $S=1$ moments\nwith a single-spin anisotropy emerge from the interplay of Coulomb repulsion\nand spin molecular-orbit coupling (SMOC). Magnetic anisotropies with bond\ndependent exchange couplings occur in the honeycomb layers when the direct\nintracluster exchange and the spin molecular-orbital coupling are both present.\nWe find that the effective spin exchange model within the layers is an XXZ +\n120$^\\circ$ honeycomb quantum compass model. The intrinsic non-spherical\nsymmetry of the multinuclear complexes leads to very different transverse and\nlongitudinal spin molecular-orbital couplings, which greatly enhances the\nsingle-spin and exchange coupling anisotropies. The interlayer coupling is\ndescribed by a XXZ model with anisotropic biquadratic terms. As the correlation\nstrength increases the systems becomes increasingly one-dimensional. Thus, if\nthe ratio of SMOC to the interlayer hopping is small this stabilizes the\nHaldane phase. However, as the ratio increases there is a quantum phase\ntransition to the topologically trivial `$D$-phase'. We also predict a quantum\nphase transition from a Haldane phase to a magnetically ordered phase at\nsufficiently strong external magnetic fields. \n\n"}

Depending on the concentration, the\npresence of these defects in LaAlO3 slab can suppress the surface conductivity.\nIn contrast, in insulating SrTiO3 slabs already very small concentrations of\noxygen vacancies or hydrogen dopant atoms induce a finite occupation of the\nconduction band.

We study mixed states formed by\nregions of one phase surrounded by the other in the case in which the scale of\nthe inhomogeneities is much larger than the interparticle distance. Two\ngeometries are studied in detail: spherical drops of one phase into the other\nand a layered structure of one phase alternating with the other. We find the\noptimum density profile in an approximation in which the free energy is a\nfunctional of the local density (LDA). It is shown that an approximation in\nwhich the density is assumed to be uniform (UDA) within each phase region gives\nresults very similar to those of the more involved LDA approach. Within the UDA\nwe derive the general equations for the chemical potential and the pressures of\neach phase which generalize the Maxwell construction to this situation. The\nequations are valid for a rather arbitrary geometry.

The range of densities in which coexistence is observed shrinks as\nthe LRC interaction increases until it reduces to a singular point.

The up-shift value is 6.8 K and an\noxygen isotope exponent ($\\alpha_S$) is about -0.8. The large oxygen isotope\neffect indicates strong electron-phonon coupling in this material. The\nsubstitution of $^{16}$O by $^{18}$O leads to a decrease in the frequency of\nphonon and an increase in the effective mass of electron ($m$$^\\ast$), so that\nthe bandwidth W is decreased and the energy difference between the different\nspin states is increased.

The main goal of the jet\nalgorithm subgroup was to explore and define standard Run II jet finding\nprocedures for CDF and DO. The focus of the jet shape/energy flow group was the\nstudy of jets as objects and the energy flows around these objects. The jet\nmeasurements/correlations subgroup discussed measurements at different beam\nenergies; strong coupling constant measurements; and LO, NLO, NNLO, and\nthreshold jet calculations. As a practical matter the algorithm and\nshape/energy flow groups merged to concentrate on the development of Run II jet\nalgorithms that are both free of theoretical and experimental difficulties and\nable to reproduce Run I measurements.\n  Starting from a review of the experience gained during Run I, the group\nconsidered a variety of cone algorithms and KT algorithms. The current\nunderstanding of both types of algorithms, including calibration issues, are\ndiscussed in this report along with some preliminary experimental results. The\njet algorithms group recommends that CDF and DO employ the same version of both\na cone algorithm and a KT algorithm during Run II. Proposed versions of each\ntype of algorithm are discussed. The group also recommends the use of full\n4-vector kinematic variables whenever possible. The recommended algorithms\nattempt to minimize the impact of seeds in the case of the cone algorithm and\npreclustering in the case of the KT algorithm. Issues regarding precluster\ndefinitions and merge/split criteria require further study. \n\n"}

We observe mid-rapidity anti-baryon to baryon ratios near unity for\n$\\Lambda$ and $\\Xi$ baryons and no dependence of the ratio on transverse\nmomentum, indicating that our data do not yet reach the quark-jet dominated\nregion. We show the dependence of the mean transverse momentum (\\mpt) on\nmeasured charged particle multiplicity and on particle mass and infer that\nthese trends are consistent with gluon-jet dominated particle production. The\ndata are compared to previous measurements from CERN-SPS, ISR and FNAL\nexperiments and to Leading Order (LO) and Next to Leading order (NLO) string\nfragmentation model predictions. We infer from these comparisons that the\nspectral shapes and particle yields from $p+p$ collisions at RHIC energies have\nlarge contributions from gluon jets rather than quark jets. \n\n"}

Although the scalar\nand vector potentials felt by the $\\Lambda$, $\\Lambda_c^+$ and $\\Lambda_b$ in\nthe corresponding hypernuclei multiplet which has the same baryon numbers are\nquite similar, the wave functions obtained, e.g., for $1s_{1/2}$ state, are\nvery different.

In this work, we discuss the extension\nof this program to hard photodisintegration of a $pp$ pair in the $^3$He\nnucleus. Experimental confirmation of new features predicted here for the\nsuggested reaction would advance our understanding of hard nuclear reactions. A\nmain prediction, in contrast with low-energy observations, is that the $pp$\nbreakup cross section is not much smaller than the one for $pn$ break up.In\nsome models, the energy-dependent oscillations observed for $pp$ scattering are\npredicted to appear in the $\\gamma ^3{\\rm He} \\to p p + n$ reaction. Such an\nobservation would open up a completely new field in studies of color coherence\nphenomena in hard nuclear reactions. We also demonstrate that, in addition to\nthe energy dependence, the measurement of the light-cone momentum distribution\nof the recoil neutron provides an independent test of the underlying dynamics\nof hard disintegration. \n\n"}

The convolution of perturbative QCD\nparton-nucleon cross sections predicts naturally the competing pattern of\nlow-pT suppression due geometrical shadowing, and a moderate-pT Cronin\nenhancement of hadron spectra. The formal equivalence to recent classical\nYang-Mills calculations is demonstrated, but our approach is shown to be more\ngeneral in the large x>0.01 domain because it automatically incorporates the\nfinite kinematic constraints of both quark and gluon processes in the\nfragmentation regions, and accounts for the observed spectra in elementary\npp-->\\pi+X processes in the RHIC energy range, sqrt{s} = 20-200 GeV.
