Moreover, both codes return errors that significantly\nunderestimate the true fitting uncertainties, which are best estimated with\nsimulations.

For star-forming galaxies, our UV-based SFRs compare\nremarkably well with those derived from SDSS H alpha. Deviations from perfect\nagreement between these two methods are due to differences in the dust\nattenuation estimates. In contrast to H alpha, UV provides reliable SFRs for\ngalaxies with weak or no H alpha emission, and where H alpha is contaminated\nwith an emission from an AGN. We use full-SED SFRs to calibrate a simple\nprescription that uses GALEX UV magnitudes to produce good SFRs for normal\nstar-forming galaxies. The specific SFR is considered as a function of stellar\nmass for (1) star-forming galaxies with no AGN, (2) those hosting an AGN, and\nfor (3) galaxies without H alpha emission. We find that the three have distinct\nstar formation histories, with AGN lying intermediate between the star-forming\nand the quiescent galaxies. Normal star forming galaxies (without an AGN) lie\non a relatively narrow linear sequence. Remarkably, galaxies hosting a strong\nAGN appear to represent the massive continuation of this sequence. Weak AGN,\nwhile also massive, have lower SFR, sometimes extending to the realm of\nquiescent galaxies.

This is entirely consistent with a 5.5 +/- 0.2\nkpc distance determined from light travel-time arguments (Blundell & Bowler\n2004). The HI emission map shows evidence of interaction of the lobes of W50\nwith the interstellar medium near the adopted systemic velocity of V_LSR = 75\nkm/s. The western lobe sits in a cavity in the HI emission near the Galactic\nplane, while the eastern lobe terminates at an expanding HI shell.

The determination of the 6Li/7Li isotopic ratio is prone\nto suffering from such asymmetries, as the contribution of 6Li is a slight\nblending reinforcement of the red wing of each component of the corresponding\n7Li line, with respect to its blue wing. Aims: The present paper studies the\nhalo star HD 74000 and estimates the impact of convection-related asymmetries\non the Li isotopic ratio determination. Method: Two methods are used to meet\nthis aim. The first, which is purely empirical, consists in deriving a template\nprofile from another element that can be assumed to originate in the same\nstellar atmospheric layers as Li I, producing absorption lines of approximately\nthe same equivalent width as individual components of the 7Li I resonance line.\nThe second method consists in conducting the abundance analysis based on NLTE\nline formation in a 3D hydrodynamical model atmosphere, taking into account the\neffects of photospheric convection.

This prediction is relatively insensitive to the details of baryonic\nphysics or cosmological parameters. In particular, if the fstar-M500 relation\nis fixed and does not evolve with redshift, CDM models predict the logarithmic\nslope of this relation to be b>-0.3. This constraint can be weakened if the\nfstar-M500 relation evolves strongly, but this implies more stars must be\nformed in situ in groups at low redshift. Conservatively requiring that at\nleast half the stars in groups were formed by z=1, the constraint from\nevolution models is b>-0.35. Since the most massive clusters (M500=1E15 Msun)\nare observed to have fstar=0.01, this means that groups with M500=5E13 Msun\nmust have fstar<0.03. Recent observations by Gonzalez et al.

We demonstrate that our measurement is robust and has an uncertainty\nof only +/-0.4 mas/yr on each component of the proper motion. We find mu_alpha\n= -11.7+/-0.4+/-0.5 mas/yr and mu_delta = +4.2+/-0.4+/-0.5 mas/yr relative to\nthe pulsar's standard of rest, where the two uncertainties are from the\nmeasurement and the ncertainties in correcting the proper motion reference\nframe, respectively. Comparing this proper motion to the symmetry axis of the\npulsar wind nebula, we must also consider the unknown velocity of the pulsar's\nprogenitor (assumed to be ~10 km/s), and hence add an additional uncertainty of\n+/-2 mas/yr to each component of the proper motion, although this could be\nsignificantly larger.

We conclude that this relationship may be\nimportant for estimating evolution in BH masses in disk galaxies out to\nintermediate redshifts, since regular spiral arm structure can be seen in\ngalaxies out to z~1. \n\n"}

Our goal\nis to address the 'void phenomenon' of Peebles (2001), which presents the\nobserved dearth of faint galaxies in voids as a challenge to the current\ncosmology. In our model, galaxy luminosity is determined only as a function of\ndark matter halo mass. With this simple assumption, we demonstrate that large,\nempty voids of ~15 Mpc/h in diameter are expected even for galaxies seven\nmagnitudes fainter than L*. The predictions of our model are in excellent\nagreement with several statistical measures; (i) the luminosity function of\ngalaxies in underdense regions, (ii) nearest neighbor statistics of dwarf\ngalaxies, (iii) the void probability function of faint galaxies. In the\ntransition between filaments and voids in the dark matter, the halo mass\nfunction changes abruptly, causing the maximum galaxy luminosity to decrease by\n~5 magnitudes over a range of ~1 Mpc/h. Thus the boundary between filaments and\nvoids in the galaxy distribution is nearly as sharp for dwarfs as for ~L*\nobjects. These results support a picture in which galaxy formation is driven\npredominantly by the mass of the host dark matter halo, and is nearly\nindependent of the larger-scale halo environment. Further, they demonstrate\nthat LCDM, combined with a straightforward bias model, naturally explains the\nexistence of the void phenomenon. \n\n"}

The broad-band spectrum is well represented by a\nthree-component model, accompanied by both a strong iron Ka line with an\nequivalent width of ~ 1.8 keV and several weak lines.

If the trend is confirmed with larger samples, it would indicate\nthat high-z galaxies are characterized by different physical conditions with\nrespect to their local counterparts. Regardless of the physical origin of the\ntrend, this effect would increase the potential of the [CII]158um line to\nsearch and characterize high-z sources. \n\n"}

Abstract: Sokoloski et al (2008) have recently reported evidence that the recurrent\nnova RS Ophiuchi produced a pair of highly collimated radio jets within days of\nits 2006 outburst. This suggests that an accretion disc must be present during\nthe outburst. However in the standard picture of recurrent novae as\nthermonuclear events, any such disc must be expelled from the white dwarf\nvicinity, as the nuclear energy yield greatly exceeds its binding energy. We\nsuggest instead that the outbursts of RS Oph are thermal--viscous instabilities\nin a disc irradiated by the central accreting white dwarf. The distinctive\nfeature of RS Oph is the very large size of its accretion disc. Given this, it\nfits naturally into a consistent picture of systems with unstable accretion\ndiscs. This picture explains the presence and speed of the jets, the brightness\nand duration of the outburst, and its rise time and linear decay, as well as\nthe faintness of the quiescence. By contrast, the hitherto standard picture of\nrecurrent thermonuclear explosions has a number of severe difficulties. These\ninclude the presence of jets, the faintness of quiescence, and the fact the the\naccretion disc must be unstable unless it is far smaller than any reasonable\nestimate. \n\n"}

Aims: We aim to compare the general relativistic (GR)\nresults by other groups with Newtonian calculations of models with equivalent\nparameters. We vary the mass ratios between NS and BH and the compactness of\nthe NS. The mass of the NS is 1.4 M_sol. We compare the dynamics in the\nparameter-space regions where the NS is expected to reach the innermost stable\ncircular orbit (ISCO) before being tidally disrupted (mass shedding, MS) and\nvice versa. Methods: The hydrodynamics is evolved by a Newtonian PPM scheme\nwith four levels of nested grids. We use a polytropic EoS (Gamma=2), as was\ndone in the GR simulations. However, instead of full GR we use a Newtonian\npotential supplemented by a Paczynski-Wiita-Artemova potential for the BH, both\ndisregarding and including rotation of the BH. Results: If the NS is compact\n(C=0.18) it is accreted by the BH more quickly, and only a small amount of mass\nremains outside the BH. If the mass ratio is small (Q=2 or 3) or the NS is less\ncompact (C=0.16 or less) the NS is tidally torn apart before being accreted.\nAlthough most of the mass is absorbed by the BH, some 0.1 M_sol remain in a\ntidal arm. For small mass ratios the tidal arm can wrap around the BH to form a\nthick disk. When including the effects of BH spin-up or spin-down by the\naccreted matter, more mass remains in the surroundings (0.2-0.3 M_sol).\nConclusions: Although details and quantitative results differ, the general\ntrends of our Newtonian calculations are similar to the GR calculations.

In this\nwork, we show the first calculations of light curves from the more realistic\nforce-free field under the framework of conventional emission models. We\ncompare the properties of gamma-ray emission between the commonly used vacuum\ndipole magnetic field and the new force-free field. We discuss the role of the\npolar cap shape and aberration effect on the appearance of the light curves as\nwell as the formation of caustics on the sky map. With the force-free field,\nthe double-peak pulse profile is best reproduced if the emission zone lies in a\nthin layer just outside the current sheet, and the peaks are mainly contributed\nfrom regions near the light cylinder. The conventional two-pole caustic model\ncan produce up to four peaks in general, while the conventional outer-gap model\ncan normally produce only one peak.

Beacom and Yueksel (2006) suggested a method to\nestimate this energy from the ratio of the 511 keV line to the MeV in-flight\nannihilation fluxes.

Our algorithm involves three steps: a reassignment of length, mass and\nvelocity units, a relabelling of the time axis, and a rescaling of the\namplitudes of individual large-scale fluctuation modes. We test it using two\nmatched pairs of simulations. Within each pair, one simulation assumes\nparameters consistent with analyses of the first-year WMAP data. The other has\nlower matter and baryon densities and a 15% lower fluctuation amplitude,\nconsistent with analyses of the three-year WMAP data. The pairs differ by a\nfactor of a thousand in mass resolution, enabling performance tests on both\nlinear and nonlinear scales. Our scaling reproduces the mass power spectra of\nthe target cosmology to better than 0.5% on large scales (k < 0.1 h/Mpc) both\nin real and in redshift space. In particular, the BAO features of the original\ncosmology are removed and are correctly replaced by those of the target\ncosmology. Errors are still below 3% for k < 1 h/Mpc.

We find that SNe lead to accretion in the disk at a\nrate of roughly 0.1 - 1 M_Sun per year and induce star formation at a rate of ~\n10 - 100 M_Sun per year which contributes to the formation of a bulge; a part\nof the stellar velocity dispersion is due to the speed of SNa shells from which\nstars are formed and a part due to the repeated action of the stochastic\ngravitational field of the network of SNa remnants on stars. The rate of SNe in\nthe inner kpc is shown to be self- regulating, and it cycles through phases of\nlow and high activity. The supernova-assisted accretion transports gas from\nabout one kpc to within a few pc of the center.

Correct interstellar absorption as well as effects of dust scattering\nare fully taken into account in the spectral analysis. The energy spectra in\nthe 2-120 keV band in both states are all dominated by strong Comptonization of\ndisk photons by an optically thick (\\tau ~7-10) and low temperature (T_e ~2-3\nkeV) hybrid plasmas containing non-thermal electrons produced with 10-60% of\nthe total power input. Absorption lines of highly ionized Fe ions detected\nduring the oscillation indicate that a strong disk wind is developed. The\nionization stage of the wind correlates with the X-ray flux, supporting the\nphotoionization origin. The iron-K emission line shows a strong variability\nduring the oscillation; the reflection is strongest during the dip but\ndisappears during the flare.

The low-temperature and\nhigh luminosity disk emission suggests that the disk structure is similar to\nthat in the very high state of canonical black hole binaries.

In particular,\nwe consider a Dirac fermion singlet interacting through a new Z' gauge boson,\nand a scalar singlet S interacting through the Higgs portal. Both candidates\nare WIMP (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles), i.e. they have an annihilation\ncross-section in the pbarn range. Also they may both have a spin-independent\nelastic cross section on nucleons in the range required by direct detection\nexperiments. Although being generic WIMP candidates, because they have\ndifferent interactions with Standard Model particles, their phenomenology\nregarding the isotropic diffuse gamma-ray emission is quite distinct.

We derive constraints on the parameter space of this model arising\nfrom the WMAP 7-year power spectrum. It has previously been shown that it is\npossible to successfully embed this potential in the MSSM. Unfortunately, to do\nthis requires severe fine-tuning. We address this issue by introducing a hybrid\nfield to dynamically uplift the potential with a subsequent smooth phase\ntransition to end inflation at the necessary point.

Nebulae resulting\nfrom such a transition have been observed around many Wolf-Rayet stars and show\ndetailed, complicated structures owing to local instabilities in the swept-up\nshells.\n  Shells also form in the case of massive binary stars, where the winds of two\nstars collide with one another. Along the collision front gas piles up, forming\na shell that rotates along with the orbital motion of the binary stars. In this\ncase the shell follows the surface along which the ram pressure of the two\ncolliding winds is in balance.\n  Using the MPI-AMRVAC hydrodynamics code we have made multi-dimensional\nsimulations of these interactions in order to model the formation and evolution\nof these circumstellar nebulae and explore whether full 3D simulations are\nnecessary to obtain accurate models of such nebulae. \n\n"}

With the help of\nspectropolarimetry, we propose to investigate the nature of shock waves\npropagating throughout the stellar atmosphere and present, for omicron Ceti\n(the prototype of Mira stars), a full observational study of hydrogen emission\nlines formed in the radiative region of such a shock. Using the instrument\nNARVAL, we performed a spectropolarimetric monitoring of omicron Ceti during\nthree consecutive pulsation cycles.

These signatures\nappear to be strongly correlated to the presence of an intense shock wave\nresponsible for the hydrogen emission lines.

On average, the escape fraction from a SFMC\nparticle rises from 0.27% at its birth to 2.1% at the end of a particle\nlifetime, 6 Myrs. This is because SFMC particles drift away from the dense gas\nclumps in which they were born, and because the gas around the star-forming\nclumps is dispersed by ionizing radiation and supernova feedback.

The shapes of the filters are based on the gaps that develop in\nsimulations of dark matter sub-halos crossing a star stream. The high Galactic\nlatitude 8.4 kpc long segment of GD-1 that we examine has 8+/-3 gaps of 99%\nsignificance or greater, with the error estimated on the basis of tests of the\ngap-filtering technique. The cumulative distribution of gaps more than 3 times\nthe width of the stream is in good agreement with predictions for dark matter\nsub-halo encounters with cold star streams. The number of gaps narrower than 3\ntimes the width of the GD-1 stream falls well below the cold stream prediction\nwhich is taken into account for the gap creation rate integrated over all\nsizes.

Prior to the work reported here,\nthe only dynamical mass estimate of a recurrent nova was for U Sco, which has a\nwhite dwarf mass of 1.55 +/- 0.24 Msolar (Thoroughgood et al. 2001).\n  We present new time-resolved, intermediate-resolution spectroscopy of the\neclipsing recurrent nova CI Aquilae (CI Aql) during quiescence.

This makes analytic\npredictions for a range of quantities including: distributions of grain\ndensities, power spectra and correlation functions of fluctuations, and maximum\ngrain densities reached. We predict how these scale as a function of grain drag\ntime t_stop, spatial scale, grain-to-gas mass ratio, strength of turbulence\n(alpha), and detailed disk properties. We test these against numerical\nsimulations with various turbulence-driving mechanisms. The simulations agree\nwell with the predictions, spanning t_stop*Omega ~ 1e-4 - 10, alpha ~ 1e-10 -\n1e-2, and grain-to-gas mass ratio ~0-3. Results from 'turbulent concentration'\nsimulations and laboratory experiments are also predicted as a special case.\nVortices on a wide range of scales disperse and concentrate grains\nhierarchically. For small grains this is most efficient in eddies with turnover\ntime comparable to the stopping time, but fluctuations are also damped by local\ngas-grain drift. For large grains, shear and gravity lead to a much broader\nrange of eddy scales driving fluctuations, with most power on the largest\nscales. The grain density distribution has a log-Poisson shape, with\nfluctuations for large grains up to factors >1000. We provide simple analytic\nexpressions for the predictions, and discuss implications for planetesimal\nformation, grain growth, and the structure of turbulence. \n\n"}

An effective field theory of\ncosmological perturbations is employed. A unitary gauge choice renders the dark\nenergy field into the gravitational sector, for which we adopt a generic\nLagrangian depending on three-dimensional geometrical scalar quantities arising\nin the ADM decomposition. We add to this dark-energy associated gravitational\nsector a scalar field $\\phi$ and its kinetic energy $X$ as dark matter\nvariables.

After 5 Gyr of evolution the merger remnant forms a\nstable triaxial galaxy with rotation only around the longest axis. The origin\nof this rotation is naturally explained as due to the symmetry of the initial\nconfiguration which leads to the conservation of angular momentum components\nalong the direction of the merger. The stars originating from the two dwarfs\nshow significantly different surface density profiles while having very similar\nkinematics in agreement with the properties of separate stellar populations in\nAnd II. We also study an alternative scenario for the formation of And II, via\ntidal stirring of a disky dwarf galaxy. While intrinsic rotation occurs\nnaturally in this model as a remnant of the initial rotation of the disk, it is\nmostly around the shortest axis of the stellar component.

The\npositions of these Detection Units, several hundred metres in length, and their\nattached Optical Modules for the detection of Cherenkov light have to be\nmonitored continously to provide the telescope with its desired pointing\nprecision. A standard way to do this is the utilisation of an acoustic\npositioning system using emitters at fixed positions and receivers distributed\nalong the Detection Units. The KM3NeT neutrino telescope comprises a\ncustom-made acoustic positioning system with newly designed emitters attached\nto the anchors of the Detection Units and custom-designed receivers attached to\nthe Detection Units. This article describes an approach for a receiver and its\nperformance. The proposed Opto-Acoustical Modules combine the optical sensors\nfor the telescope with the acoustical sensors necessary for the positioning of\nthe module itself. This combination leads to a compact design suited for an\neasy deployment of the numerous Detection Units. Furthermore, the instrumented\nvolume can be used for scientific analyses such as marine science and acoustic\nparticle detection. \n\n"}

Such faint limits are well beyond the current observational limits and\nare likely to remain beyond the limits of next generation facilities. The\nreconstructed LFs, when combined with direct measurements of the LFs at higher\nluminosity, are well-fit by a standard Schechter function with no evidence of a\nbreak to the faintest limits probed by this technique. The derived faint end\nslope, $\\alpha$, steepens from $\\approx-1.2$ at $z<1$ to $\\approx-1.6$ at\n$4<z<5$.

We investigate this scenario in depth using 42 relativistic\n2D simulations with multi-group neutrino transport to examine the effects of\nvelocity and density perturbations in the progenitor for different perturbation\ngeometries that obey fundamental physical constraints (like the anelastic\ncondition). As a framework for analysing our results, we introduce\nsemi-empirical scaling laws relating neutrino heating, average turbulent\nvelocities in the gain region, and the shock deformation in the saturation\nlimit of non-radial instabilities. The squared turbulent Mach number, <Ma^2>,\nreflects the violence of aspherical motions in the gain layer, and explosive\nrunaway occurs for <Ma^2>~0.3, corresponding to a reduction of the critical\nneutrino luminosity by ~25% compared to 1D. In the light of this theory,\nprogenitor asphericities aid shock revival mainly by creating anisotropic mass\nflux onto the shock: Differential infall efficiently converts velocity\nperturbations in the progenitor into density perturbations (Delta rho/rho) at\nthe shock of the order of the initial convective Mach number Ma. The\nanisotropic mass flux and ram pressure deform the shock and thereby amplify\npost-shock turbulence. Large-scale (l=2,l=1) modes prove most conducive to\nshock revival, whereas small-scale perturbations require unrealistically high\nconvective Mach numbers. Initial density perturbations in the progenitor are\nonly of order Ma^2 and therefore play a subdominant role. \n\n"}

To this purpose, we include hadronic, radiative and adiabatic\ncooling effects and discuss their relevance for long- (including high- and\nlow-luminosity) and short-duration GRBs. The expected diffuse neutrino\nbackground is derived, by requiring that the GRB high-energy neutrino\ncounterparts follow up-to-date gamma-ray luminosity functions and redshift\nevolutions of the long and short GRBs.

While major mergers likely drive this enhanced efficiency in some\nstarbursts, the lowest mass starbursts may experience periodic bursts,\nconsistent with enhanced scatter in t_dep at low M*. Two starbursts appear to\nbe pre-coalescence mergers; their elevated MHI/M* suggest that HI-to-H2\nconversion is still ongoing at this stage.

(2010). We show\nthat their finding that the 3D magnetic field scales approximately as\ndensity$^{0.65}$ can also be obtained from analysis of the observed\nline-of-sight fields. We present two large-scale AMR MHD simulations of several\nthousand $M_\\odot$ of turbulent, isothermal, self-gravitating gas, one with a\nstrong initial magnetic field (Alfven Mach number $M_{A,0}= 1$) and one with a\nweak initial field ($M_{A,0}=10$). We construct samples of the 100 most massive\nclumps in each simulation and show that they exhibit a power-law relation\nbetween field strength and density in excellent agreement with the observed\none. Our results imply that the average field in molecular clumps in the\ninterstellar medium is $<B_{tot}> \\sim 42 n_{H,4}^{0.65} \\mu$G. Furthermore,\nthe median value of the ratio of the line-of-sight field to density$^{0.65}$ in\nthe simulations is within a factor of about (1.3, 1.7) of the observed value\nfor the strong and weak field cases, respectively. The median value of the\nmass-to-flux ratio, normalized to the critical value, is 70% of the\nline-of-sight value. This is larger than the 50% usually cited for spherical\nclouds because the actual mass-to-flux ratio depends on the volume-weighted\nfield, whereas the observed one depends on the mass-weighted field. Our results\nindicate that the typical molecular clump in the ISM is significantly\nsupercritical (~ factor of 3). The results of our strong-field model are in\nvery good quantitative agreement with the observations of Li et al. (2009),\nwhich show a strong correlation in field orientation between small and large\nscales. Because there is a negligible correlation in the weak-field model, we\nconclude that molecular clouds form from strongly magnetized (although\nmagnetically supercritical) gas. \n\n"}

One implication is that the planet should appear\nlarger during a primary transit observed in high energy bands than in the\noptical band. The last Venus transit in 2012 offered a unique opportunity to\nstudy this effect. The transit has been monitored by solar space observations\nfrom Hinode and Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). We measure the radius of\nVenus during the transit in three different bands with subpixel accuracy:\noptical (4500A), UV (1600A, 1700A), Extreme UltraViolet (EUV, 171-335A) and\nsoft X-rays (about 10A). We find that, while the Venus optical radius is about\n80 km larger than the solid body radius (the expected opacity mainly due to\nclouds and haze), the radius increases further by more than 70 km in the EUV\nand soft X-rays.

Similar spectral features are often\nobserved in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) and other black-hole binaries (BHBs),\nand several models have been proposed for explaining it. In order to\ndistinguish spectral models, time variation provides an important key. In AGNs,\nvariation amplitude has been found to drop significantly at the iron K-energy\nband at timescales of ~10 ks. If spectral variations of black-holes are\nnormalized by their masses, the spectral variations of BHBs at timescales of\nsub-seconds should exhibit similar characteristics to those of AGNs. In this\npaper, we investigated spectral variations of GRS 1915+105 at timescales down\nto ~10 ms. This was made possible for the first time with the Suzaku XIS\nParallel-sum clocking (P-sum) mode, which has the CCD energy-resolution as well\nas a time-resolution of 7.8 ms. Consequently, we found that the variation\namplitude of GRS 1915+105 does not drop at the iron K-energy band at any\ntimescales from 0.06 s to 63000 s, and that the entire X-ray flux and the iron\nfeature are independently variable at timescales of hours. These are naturally\nunderstood in the framework of the ``partial covering'' model, in which\nvariation timescales of the continuum flux and partial absorbers are\nindependent. The difference of energy dependence of the variation amplitude\nbetween AGN and BHB is presumably due to different mechanisms of the outflow\nwinds, i.e., the partial absorbers are due to UV-line driven winds (AGN) or\nthermally-driven winds (BHB). \n\n"}

Here we specialize the quasi-Keplerian formalism to\nbinaries with low eccentricity. In this limit the non-periodic contribution to\nthe gravitational-wave phasing can be expressed explicitly as simple functions\nof frequency or time, with little additional complexity beyond the well-known\nformulas for circular binaries. These eccentric phase corrections are computed\nto 3PN order and to leading order in the eccentricity for the standard PN\napproximants. For a variety of systems these eccentricity corrections cause\nsignificant corrections to the number of gravitational wave cycles that sweep\nthrough a detector's frequency band. This is evaluated using several measures,\nincluding a modification of the useful cycles. We also evaluate the role of\nperiodic terms that enter the phasing and discuss how they can be incorporated\ninto some of the PN approximants. While the eccentric extension of the PN\napproximants is our main objective, this work collects a variety of results\nthat may be of interest to others modeling eccentric relativistic binaries. \n\n"}

The flux boosting due to the relativistic\nbeaming is a very sensitive factor of the jet orientation angle, as seen by the\nobserver. Quite often large bends are seen in these jets, with misalignments\nbeing $90^\\circ$ or more and might imply a change in the orientation angle that\ncould cause a large change in the relativistic beaming factor.

Most galaxies more massive than\n$3\\times10^{10} M_\\odot$ follow the red-sequence while less massive central\ngalaxies lie on the blue sequence.

In galaxies less massive than\n$3\\times10^{10} M_\\odot$, young stars and supernovae drive a high entropy\noutflow that is more buoyant that any diffuse corona. The outflow balances the\nrate of gas inflow, preventing high gas densities building up in the central\nregions. More massive galaxies, however, are surrounded by a hot corona.

The physical conditions for\ngrain evolution are taken from hydrodynamical simulations of giant molecular\nclouds in a Milky Way-like spiral galaxy. We improve the treatment of dust\ngrowth by accretion in the ISM to investigate the role of the\ntemperature-dependent sticking coefficient and ion-grain interactions. From\ndetailed observational data on the gas-phase Si abundances [Si/H]_{gas}\nmeasured in the local Galaxy, we derive a relation between the average\n[Si/H]_{gas} and the local gas density n(H) which we use as a critical\nconstraint for the models. This relation requires a sticking coefficient that\ndecreases with the gas temperature. The synthetic relation constructed from the\nspatial dust distribution reproduces the slope of -0.5 of the observed relation\nin cold clouds. This slope is steeper than that for the warm medium and is\nexplained by the dust growth. We find that it occurs for all adopted values of\nthe minimum grain size a_{min} from 1 to 5nm. For the classical cut-off of\na_{min}=5 nm, the ion-grain interactions result in longer growth timescales and\nhigher [Si/H]_{gas} than the observed values. For a_{min} below 3 nm, the\nion-grain interactions enhance the growth rates, steepen the slope of\n[Si/H]_{gas}-n(H) relation and provide a better match to observations. The\nrates of dust re-formation in the ISM by far exceed the rates of dust\nproduction by stellar sources as expected from simple evolution models. After\nthe cycle of matter in and out of dust reaches a steady state, the dust growth\nbalances the destruction operating on similar timescales of 350 Myr. \n\n"}

Such acceleration\ncan produce the non-thermal particles that emit the broadband continuum\nradiation that is detected from extragalactic jets. An important recent\ndevelopment for blazar science is the ability of Fermi-LAT spectroscopy to pin\ndown the shape of the distribution of the underlying non-thermal particle\npopulation. This paper highlights how multi-wavelength spectra spanning optical\nto X-ray to gamma-ray bands can be used to probe diffusive acceleration in\nrelativistic, oblique, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) shocks in blazar jets.\nDiagnostics on the MHD turbulence near such shocks are obtained using thermal\nand non-thermal particle distributions resulting from detailed Monte Carlo\nsimulations of DSA. These probes are afforded by the characteristic property\nthat the synchrotron $\\nu F_{\\nu}$ peak energy does not appear in the gamma-ray\nband above 100 MeV. We investigate self-consistently the radiative synchrotron\nand inverse Compton signatures of the simulated particle distributions.\nImportant constraints on the diffusive mean free paths of electrons, and the\nlevel of electromagnetic field turbulence are identified for three different\ncase study blazars, Mrk 501, BL Lacertae and AO 0235+164. The X-ray excess of\nAO 0235+164 in a flare state can be modelled as the signature of bulk Compton\nscattering of external radiation fields, thereby tightly constraining the\nenergy-dependence of the diffusion coefficient for electrons. The concomitant\ninterpretations that turbulence levels decline with remoteness from jet shocks,\nand the probable significant role for non-gyroresonant diffusion, are posited. \n\n"}

Examples of targeted lines include the\n$21\\,\\textrm{cm}$ hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen, rotational lines of\ncarbon monoxide, and fine structure lines of singly ionized carbon. Recent\nefforts have focused on detections of the power spectrum of spatial\nfluctuations, but have been hindered by systematics such as foreground\ncontamination.

We apply this\nmethod on the {\\em Fermi} / Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) data sample\ncontaining 1591 GRBs. The most noticeable feature we found is near the Galactic\ncoordinates $l\\approx 30^\\circ$, $b\\approx 15^\\circ$ and radius $r\\approx\n20^\\circ-40^\\circ$. The inferred probability for the occurrence of such an\nanisotropic signal (in a random isotropic sample) is derived to be less than a\npercent in some of the tests while the other tests give results consistent with\nisotropy. These are based on the comparison of the results from the real data\nwith the randomly shuffled data samples. Considering large number of statistics\nwe used in this work (which some of them are correlated to each other) we can\nanticipate that the detected feature could be result of statistical\nfluctuations. Moreover, we noticed a considerably low number of GRBs in this\nparticular patch which might be due to some instrumentation or observational\neffects that can consequently affect our statistics through some systematics.\nFurther investigation is highly desirable in order clarify about this result,\ne.g. utilizing a larger future {\\em Fermi} / GBM data sample as well as data\nsamples of other GRB missions and also looking for possible systematics. \n\n"}

In this paper we consider the\nconstraints on both meanings of dark radiation based upon the newest results\nfor light-element nuclear reaction rates, observed light-element abundances and\nthe power spectrum of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Adding dark\nradiation during big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) alters the Friedmann expansion\nrate causing the nuclear reactions to freeze out at a different temperature.\nThis changes the final light element abundances at the end of BBN. Its\ninfluence on the CMB is to change the effective expansion rate at the surface\nof last scattering. We find that the BBN constraint reduces the allowed range\nfor both types of dark radiation at 10 Mev to between $-12.1\\%$ and $+6.2\\%$ of\nthe {\\bf total} background energy density at 10 Mev. Combining this result with\nfits to the CMB power spectrum, produces different results for particle vs.\nbrane-world dark radiation.

So far\nneither observational systematics nor new physics has been successfully\nimplemented to explain this tension away. This paper present a new solution to\nthe Hubble constant problem.

However,\nunlike in the Standard Cosmological Model (i.e. $\\Lambda$CDM model +\nperturbations), within the Simsilun simulation relativistic and nonlinear\nevolution of cosmic structures leads to the phenomenon of emerging spatial\ncurvature, where the mean spatial curvature evolves from spatial flatness of\nthe early universe towards slightly curved present-day universe.

If the isolation mass is very small, then\ngas accretion is protracted and the planet remains at a few Earth masses with a\nmainly solid composition. For larger values of the pebble isolation mass, the\nplanet might be able to accrete gas from the protoplanetary disc and grow into\na gas giant. Previous works have determined a scaling of the pebble isolation\nmass with cube of the disc aspect ratio.

The aim of the new approach is to provide\ninterplanetary space weather forecasting models with accurate time dependent\nboundary conditions of erupting magnetic flux ropes in the upper solar corona.\nTo produce boundary conditions, we couple two different modelling techniques,\nMHD simulations and a quasi-static non-potential evolution model. Both are\napplied on a spatial domain that covers the entire solar surface. The\nnon-potential model uses a time series of observed synoptic magnetograms to\ndrive the non-potential quasi-static evolution of the coronal magnetic field.\nThis allows us to follow the formation and loss of equilibrium of magnetic flux\nropes. Following this a MHD simulation captures the dynamic evolution of the\nerupting flux rope.

We assume that activity in the core of the massive star, an initial\nmass of 15Mo, about two years before explosion energizes the envelope, and with\nthe stellar evolutionary code MESA follow the inflated envelope as a result of\nenergy deposition to the envelope. We examine the conditions for a companion\nstar to accrete mass from the inflated envelope.

The richness, the period and amplitude range, and the photometric\nprecision of this sample make it possible to unveil, for the first time,\nsignatures of different surface inhomogeneity regimes in the amplitude-period\ndensity diagram. The modulation amplitude distribution shows a clear\nbimodality, with an evident gap at periods $P \\le 2$ d. The low amplitude\nbranch, in turn, shows a period bimodality with a main clustering at periods $P\n\\approx$ 5 - 10 d and a secondary clustering of ultra-fast rotators at $P \\le\n0.5$ d. The amplitude-period multimodality is correlated with the position in\nthe period-absolute magnitude (or period-color) diagram, with the low- and\nhigh-amplitude stars occupying different preferential locations.

Helio- and asteroseismology reveal a strong extraction of\nangular momentum from stellar radiation zones over the whole\nHertzsprung-Russell diagram. Turbulent transport in differentially rotating\nstably stratified stellar radiation zones should be carefully modeled and its\nstrength evaluated. Stratification and rotation imply that this turbulent\ntransport is anisotropic. Only phenomenological prescriptions have been\nproposed for the transport in the horizontal direction, which however\nconstitutes a cornerstone in current theoretical formalisms for stellar\nhydrodynamics in evolution codes. We derive a new theoretical prescription for\nthe anisotropy of the turbulent transport in radiation zones using a spectral\nformalism for turbulence that takes simultaneously stable stratification,\nrotation, and a radial shear into account. Then, the horizontal turbulent\ntransport resulting from 3D turbulent motions sustained by the instability of\nthe radial differential rotation is derived. We implement this framework in the\nstellar evolution code STAREVOL and quantify its impact on the rotational and\nstructural evolution of low-mass stars from the pre-main-sequence to the red\ngiant branch.

Subsequent characterization of the\nmass-dependence of this behavior up to the age of the Sun led to the advent of\ngyrochronology, which uses the rotation rate of a star to infer its age from an\nempirical calibration. The efficacy of the method relies on predictable angular\nmomentum loss from a stellar wind entrained in the large-scale magnetic field\nproduced by global dynamo action. Recent observational evidence suggests that\nthe global dynamo begins to shut down near the middle of a star's main-sequence\nlifetime, leading to a disruption in the production of large-scale magnetic\nfield, a dramatic reduction in angular momentum loss, and a breakdown of\ngyrochronology relations.

However, their very existence\nand formation environment in the early Universe are still under debate, with\ntheir supposed rarity further exacerbating the problem of modeling their\nab-initio formation. SMS models have shown that rapid collapse, with an infall\nrate above a critical value, in metal-free haloes is a requirement for the\nformation of a proto-stellar core which will then form an SMS. Using a\nradiation hydrodynamics simulation of early galaxy formation, we show the\nnatural emergence of metal-free haloes both massive enough, and with\nsufficiently high infall rates, to form an SMS. We find that haloes that are\nexposed to both a Lyman-Werner intensity of J_LW ~ 3 J_21 and that undergo at\nleast one period of rapid growth early in their evolution are ideal cradles for\nSMS formation. This rapid growth induces substantial dynamical heating,\namplifying the existing Lyman-Werner suppression originating from a group of\nyoung galaxies 20 kiloparsecs away.

From a comprehensive treatment of blowout we show that\nSNae by themselves fail by more than one order of magnitude to distribute the\nproducts of stellar nucleosynthesis over volumes large enough to pollute the\nwhole IGM to the metallicity levels observed. Thus, a additional (but as yet\nunknown) physical mechanism must be invoked to mix the metals on scales\ncomparable to the mean distance between the galaxies which are most efficient\npollutants. From this simple hypothesis we derive a number of testable\npredictions for the evolution of the IGM metallicity. Specifically, we find\nthat: (i) the fraction of metals ejected over the star formation history of the\nuniverse is about 50% at z=0; that is, approximately half of the metals today\nare found in the IGM; (ii) if the ejected metals were homogeneously mixed with\nthe baryons in the universe, the average IGM metallicity would be <Z> ~ 1/25\nZ(solar) at z=3.

Ten years before, IRAS had unveiled a population\nof luminous IR galaxies exhibiting such a ``shy'' behavior, the so-called LIGs\nand ULIGs (with 12 < log(L[IR]/Lsol < 11 and L[IR]/Lsol > 12 respectively),\nwhich are responsible for the shape of the bolometric luminosity function of\nlocal galaxies above ~ 10^11 Lsol. But integrated over the whole local\nluminosity function, LIGs and ULIGs only produce ~ 2 % of the total integrated\nluminosity and overall only ~ 30 % of the bolometric luminosity of local\ngalaxies is radiated in the IR above ~ 5 microns.

We use this new algorithm to examine some of\nthe claims made for substructure on the basis of \"anomalous flux ratios\".

The nuclear starburst environment in\n  NGC4945 Abstract: A multi-line millimeter-wave study of the nearby starburst galaxy NGC 4945\nhas been carried out using the Swedish-ESO Submillimeter Telescope (SEST). The\nstudy covers the frequency range from 82 GHz to 354 GHz and includes 80\ntransitions of 19 molecules. 1.3 mm continuum data of the nuclear source are\nalso presented. A large number of molecular species indicate the presence of a\nprominent high density interstellar gas component characterized by $n_{\\rm\nH_2}\\sim10^5$ cm$^{-3}$. Abundances of molecular species are calculated and\ncompared with abundances observed toward the starburst galaxies NGC 253 and M\n82 and galactic sources. Apparent is an `overabundance' of HNC in the nuclear\nenvironment of NGC 4945. While the HNC/HCN $J$=1--0 line intensity ratio is\n$\\sim$0.5, the HNC/HCN abundance ratio is $\\sim$1. While HCN is subthermally\nexcited ($T_{\\rm ex}\\sim$8 K), CN is even less excited ($T_{\\rm ex}\\sim$3--4\nK), indicating that it arises from a less dense gas component and that its\n$N$=2--1 line can be optically thin even though its $N$=1--0 emission is\nmoderately optically thick.

These distant red galaxies (DRGs)\nare efficiently selected by the criterion J-K>2.3. We use Chandra data to\nexamine the X-ray emission from DRGs in the 5'x5' FIRES MS1054-03 field. Two of\n40 DRGs with K<22 are detected by Chandra, and we infer that ~5 % of DRGs host\nactive nuclei with L>1.2x10^43 ergs/s. This fraction is smaller than that\ninferred from optical and near-IR spectroscopy, probably largely due to strong\nspectroscopic selection biases. By stacking all undetected DRGs we find that\ntheir average X-ray flux in the 0.5-8 keV band is ~4.6x10^-17 ergs/s/cm^2. The\ndetection is only significant in the soft and full energy bands. The mean\ndetection may result from star formation, the presence of low luminosity AGN,\nor a combination of both.

The overall\nenergetics of the jets are strongly spin-dependent, with high-spin black holes\nproducing the highest energy and mass fluxes. In addition, with high-spin black\nholes, the ultra-relativistic outflow is cylindrically collimated within a few\nhundred gravitational radii of the black hole, whereas in the zero- spin case\nthe jet retains a constant opening angle of approximately 16 degrees. The\nsimulations also show that the coronal wind, though considerably slower and\ncolder than the jets, also carries a significant amount of mass and energy.\nWhen simulation data is scaled to the physical dimensions of a collapsar the\njets operate for a period ranging from 0.1 to 1.4 seconds, until the accretion\ndisk is depleted, delivering $10^{48}$ to $10^{49}$ erg. \n\n"}

Abstract: The collapsar model for gamma-ray bursts requires three essential\ningredients: a massive core, removal of the hydrogen envelope, and enough\nangular momentum in the core. We study current massive star evolution models of\nsolar metallicity to determine which massive star physics is capable of\nproducing these ingredients. In particular, we investigate the role of\nhydrodynamic and magnetic internal angular momentum transport and binary mass\nand angular momentum transfer. We follow the evolution of rotating single stars\nand of binary systems that include rotational processes for both stars.\nNeglecting magnetic fields, we show that the cores of massive single stars can\nmaintain a high specific angular momentum when evolved with the assumption that\nmean molecular weight gradients suppress rotational mixing processes. In binary\nsystems that undergo mass transfer during core hydrogen burning the mass\nreceiving star accretes large amounts of high angular momentum material,\nleading to a spin-up of the core. We find, however, that this merely\ncompensates for the tidal angular momentum loss due to spin-orbit coupling,\nwhich leads to synchronous rotation before the mass transfer event. Therefore\nthe resulting cores do not rotate faster than in single stars. We also present\nmodels that include magnetic fields generated by differential rotation and we\nconsider the internal angular momentum transport by magnetic torques. We\ninvestigate the capability of magnetic torques to efficiently pump angular\nmomentum into the cores of accreting stars. Despite our finding that this\nmechanism works, the magnetic coupling of core and envelope after the accreting\nstar ends core hydrogen burning leads to slower rotation than in the\nnon-magnetic case. \n\n"}

If the orbital geometry of the triple has not changed since the\nbirth of the planet, then a disk around the planetary host star would probably\nhave been too compact and too hot for a Jovian planet to form by the\ncore-accretion model or gravitational collapse. This paradox is resolved if the\nstar was initially either single or had a much more distant companion.

Abstract: We review the evidence for recently accelerating cosmological expansion or\n\"dark energy\", either a negative pressure constituent in General Relativity\n(Dark Energy) or modified gravity (Dark Gravity), without any Dark Energy\nconstituent. If constituent Dark Energy does not exist, so that our universe is\nnow dominated by pressure-free matter, Einstein gravity must be modified at low\ncurvature. The vacuum symmetry of any Robertson-Walker universe then\ncharacterizes Dark Gravity as low- or high-curvature modifications of Einstein\ngravity. The dynamics of either kind of \"dark energy\" cannot be derived from\nthe homogeneous expansion alone, but requires also observing the growth of\ninhomogeneities. Present and projected observations are all consistent with a\nsmall fine tuned cosmological constant, with nearly static Dark Energy, or with\ngravity modified at cosmological scales. The growth of cosmological\nfluctuations will potentially distinguish static \"dark energy\" from dynamic\n\"dark energy\" with equation of state $w(z)$ either changing rapidly or tracking\nthe background matter.

Using a galaxy\nformation model grafted onto the Millennium Simulation of the LCDM cosmogony,\nwe study how assembly bias affects galaxy clustering. We compare the original\nsimulation to `shuffled' versions where the galaxy populations are randomly\nswapped among halos of similar mass, thus isolating the effects of correlations\nbetween assembly history and environment at fixed mass. Such correlations are\nignored in the halo occupation distribution models often used populate dark\nmatter simulations with galaxies, but they are significant in our more\nrealistic simulation. Assembly bias enhances 2-point correlations by 10% for\ngalaxies with M_bJ-5logh brighter than -17, but suppresses them by a similar\namount for galaxies brighter than -20. When such samples are split by colour,\nassembly bias is 5% stronger for red galaxies and 5% weaker for blue ones. Halo\ncentral galaxies are differently affected by assembly bias than are galaxies of\nall types. It almost doubles the correlation amplitude for faint red central\ngalaxies. Shuffling galaxies among halos of fixed formation redshift or\nconcentration in addition to fixed mass produces biases which are not much\nsmaller than when mass alone is fixed. Assembly bias must reflect a correlation\nof environment with aspects of halo assembly which are not encoded in either of\nthese parameters.

It is common to use these correlations to\nestimate the expected abundance of massive black holes. This is usually done by\nstarting from an observed distribution of velocity dispersions or luminosities\nand then changing variables. This procedure neglects the fact that there is\nintrinsic scatter in these black hole mass--observable correlations. Accounting\nfor this scatter results in estimates of black hole abundances which are larger\nby almost an order of magnitude at masses >10^9 M_sun. Including this scatter\nis particularly important for models which seek to infer quasar lifetimes and\nduty cycles from the local black hole mass function. However, even when scatter\nhas been accounted for, the M_bh-sigma relation predicts fewer massive black\nholes than does the M_bh-L relation. This is because the sigma-L relation in\nthe black hole samples currently available is inconsistent with that in the\nSDSS sample from which the distributions of L or sigma are based: the black\nhole samples have smaller L for a given sigma, or larger sigma for a given L.\nThe sigma-L relation in the black hole samples is similarly discrepant with\nthat in other samples of nearby early-type galaxies.

For this purpose we have run a\nhigh resolution N-body simulation of a two-component dwarf galaxy orbiting in a\nMilky Way potential. The dwarf is placed on a highly eccentric orbit, its\ninitial stellar component is in the form of an exponential disk and it has a\nNFW-like dark matter halo. After 10 Gyrs of evolution the dwarf produces a\nspheroidal stellar component and is strongly tidally stripped so that mass\nfollows light and the stars are on almost isotropic orbits. From this final\nstate, we create mock kinematic data sets for 200 stars by observing the dwarf\nin different directions. We find that when the dwarf is observed along the\ntidal tails the kinematic samples are strongly contaminated by unbound stars\nfrom the tails. We also study another source of possible contamination by\nadding stars from the Milky Way.

RESULT: The ACS images reveal\nshells well within the effective radius in some galaxies (at 1.7 kpc in the\ncase of NGC 5982). In some cases, strong nuclear dust patches prevent detection\nof inner shells. Most shells have colours which are similar to the underlying\ngalaxy. Some inner shells are redder than the galaxy.

Why therefore do we\nnot see AGNs at the center of most elliptical galaxies rather than in only (at\nmost) a few per cent of them? We propose here the simple idea that feedback\nfrom accretion events heats the ambient gas retarding subsequent infall. In\nthis context, we present a class of 1D hydrodynamical evolutionary sequences\nfor the gas flows in elliptical galaxies with a massive central BH. The\nresulting evolution is characterized by strong oscillations, in which very fast\nand energetic bursts of the BH are followed by longer periods in which the\nX-ray galaxy emission comes from the coronal gas.

This conversion factor is a\nfunction of the FWHM of the beam or point spread function and also depends on\nthe intrinsic surface brightness distribution of the source.\n  In this paper conversion factors are presented for a number of simple\ngeometries: a circular constant surface brightness disk and a spherical\nconstant emissivity shell, using a range of values for the inner radius. Also\nmore realistic geometries are studied, based on a spherically symmetric\nphoto-ionization model of a planetary nebula. This enables a study of optical\ndepth effects, a comparison between images in various emission lines and the\nuse of power law density distributions.

Due to the\nrelative smallness of the solar angular momentum J and the large values of the\nplanetary semimajor axes a, the gravitomagnetic precessions, which affect the\nnodes Omega and the perihelia omega and are proportional to J/a^3, are of the\norder of 10^-3 arcseconds per century only for, e.g., Mercury. This value lies\njust at the edge of the present-day observational sensitivity in reconstructing\nthe planetary orbits, although future missions to Mercury like Messenger and\nBepiColombo could allow to increase it. The major problems come from the main\nsources of systematic errors. They are the aliasing classical precessions\ninduced by the multipolar expansion of the Sun's gravitational potential and\nthe classical secular N-body precessions which are of the same order of\nmagnitude or much larger than the Lense-Thirring precessions of interest.

While the earlier regime\nof parametric resonant particle production and the later turbulent regime of\ninteracting fields evolving towards equilibrium are well identified and\nunderstood, the short intermediate stage of violent nonlinear dynamics remains\nless explored. Lattice simulations of fully nonlinear preheating dynamics show\nspecific features of this intermediate stage: occupation numbers of the scalar\nparticles are peaked, scalar fields become significantly non-gaussian and the\nfield dynamics become chaotic and irreversible. Visualization of the field\ndynamics in configuration space reveals that nonlinear interactions generate\nnon-gaussian inflaton inhomogeneities with very fast growing amplitudes. The\npeaks of the inflaton inhomogeneities coincide with the peaks of the scalar\nfield(s) produced by parametric resonance. When the inflaton peaks reach their\nmaxima, they stop growing and begin to expand. The subsequent dynamics is\ndetermined by expansion and superposition of the scalar waves originating from\nthe peaks. Multiple wave superposition results in phase mixing and turbulent\nwave dynamics. Thus, the short intermediate stage is defined by the formation,\nexpansion and collision of bubble-like field inhomogeneities associated with\nthe peaks of the original gaussian field.

Although most of our discussion refers to arbitrary p-branes, when\nwe need to be specific we assume that they are D-branes of Type II or Type I\nstring theory.

All the scalars of the supersymmetric standard model become\nultraheavy, except for a single finely tuned Higgs. Yet, the fermions of the\nsupersymmetric standard model can remain light, protected by chiral symmetry,\nand account for the successful unification of gauge couplings.

This result purports to offer a\ntheoretical explanation for an intriguing similarity, that was recently\nobserved, between a supernova explosion and a plasma implosion. In this paper\nwe extend this result to discuss the symmetries of discontinuous flows, which\nfurther validates the explanation by taking into account shock waves, which are\nthe driving force behind both the explosion and implosion. This is accomplished\nby constructing a new set of Rankine-Hugoniot conditions, which follow from\nNoether's conservation laws. The new set is dual to the standard\nRankine-Hugoniot conditions and is related to them through the SL(2,R)\ntransformations. The entropy condition, that the shock needs to satisfy for\nphysical reasons, is also seen to remain invariant under the transformations. \n\n"}

{"id": "nucl-th/0207067", "contents": "Title: Constraining URCA cooling of neutron stars from the neutron radius of\n  208Pb Abstract: Recent observations by the Chandra observatory suggest that some neutron\nstars may cool rapidly, perhaps by the direct URCA process which requires a\nhigh proton fraction. The proton fraction is determined by the nuclear symmetry\nenergy whose density dependence may be constrained by measuring the neutron\nradius of a heavy nucleus, such as 208Pb. Such a measurement is necessary for a\nreliable extrapolation of the proton fraction to the higher densities present\nin the neutron star. A large neutron radius in 208Pb implies a stiff symmetry\nenergy that grows rapidly with density, thereby favoring a high proton fraction\nand allowing direct URCA cooling. Predictions for the neutron radius in 208Pb\nare correlated to the proton fraction in dense matter by using a variety of\nrelativistic effective field-theory models. Models that predict a neutron (Rn)\nminus proton (Rp) root-mean-square radius in 208Pb to be Rn-Rp<0.20 fm have\nproton fractions too small to allow the direct URCA cooling of 1.4 solar-mass\nneutron stars. Conversely, if Rn-Rp>0.25 fm, the direct URCA process is allowed\n(by all models) to cool down a 1.4 solar-mass neutron star. The Parity Radius\nExperiment at Jefferson Laboratory aims to measure the neutron radius in 208Pb\naccurately and model independently via parity-violating electron scattering.\nSuch a measurement would greatly enhance our ability to either confirm or\ndismiss the direct URCA cooling of neutron stars. \n\n"}

The power of the EFT adopted here is that one\ncan correlate in a unified formalism the weak-current matrix elements of two-,\nthree- and four-nucleon systems.

It is found that the effects are less significant than those in\nthe case without neutrino trapping. The weak dependence of the equation of\nstate on the symmetry energy is shown as the main reason of this finding. Using\ndifferent RMF models the dynamical instabilities of uniform matters, with and\nwithout neutrino trapping, have been also studied. The interplay between the\ndominant contribution of the variation of matter composition and the role of\neffective masses of mesons and nucleons leads to higher critical densities for\nmatter with neutrino trapping. Furthermore, the predicted critical density is\ninsensitive to the number of trapped neutrinos as well as to the RMF model used\nin the investigation. It is also found that additional nonlinear terms in the\nHorowitz-Piekarewicz and Furnstahl-Serot-Tang models prevent another kind of\ninstability, which occurs at relatively high densities. The reason is that the\neffective sigma meson mass in their models increases as a function of the\nmatter density. \n\n"}

The fibers and the coupler are polarization-preserving to guarantee a\nhigh signal-to-noise ratio. When the two input fibers are used to collect the\nscattered light with the same momentum transfer vector but from two spatially\nseparated regions in a flow, the obtained signals interfere when combined via\nthe fiber-optic coupler. The resultant light received by a photomultiplier tube\ncontains a cross-beat frequency proportional to the velocity difference between\nthe two measuring points. If the two input fibers are used to collect the\nscattered light from a common scattering region but with two different momentum\ntransfer vectors, the resultant light then contains a self-beat frequency\nproportional to the local velocity at the measuring point. The experiment shows\nthat both the cross-beat and self-beat signals are large and the standard laser\nDoppler signal processor can be used to measure the velocity difference and\nlocal velocity in real time.
