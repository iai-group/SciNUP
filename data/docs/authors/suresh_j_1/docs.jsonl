The imaging is complemented by a recent wide field\nredshift survey of the cluster conducted with Hectospec on the 6.5m MMT. Among\nthe many scientific applications for this data are the search for compact\ngalaxies. In this paper, we present the discovery of seven compact (but quite\nluminous) stellar systems, ranging from M32-like galaxies down to ultra-compact\ndwarfs (UCDs)/dwarf to globular transition objects (DGTOs). We find that all\nseven compact galaxies require a two-component fit to their light profile and\nhave measured velocity dispersions that exceed those expected for typical\nearly-type galaxies at their luminosity. From our structural parameter analysis\nwe conclude that three of the sample should be classified as compact\nellipticals or M32-like galaxies, the remaining four being less extreme\nsystems. The three compact ellipticals are all found to have old luminosity\nweighted ages (> 12 Gyr), intermediate metallicities (-0.6 < [Fe/H] < -0.1) and\nhigh [Mg/Fe] (> 0.25).

We have studied the\ndynamical evolution of these Multi-state Boson Stars (MSBS) under radial\nperturbations, using numerical techniques. We show that stable MSBS can be\nconstructed, when the number of particles in the first excited state, N2, is\nsmaller than the number of particles in the ground state, N1. On the other\nhand, when N2 > N1, the configurations are initially unstable. However, they\nevolve and settle down into stable configurations. In the stabilization\nprocess, the initially ground state is excited and ends in a first excited\nstate, whereas the initially first excited state ends in a ground state.

In this\npaper, we compare two different QET protocols for transporting energy with\nelectromagnetic field. In the first protocol, a 1/2 spin (a qubit) is coupled\nwith the quantum fluctuation in the vacuum state and measured in order to\nobtain one-bit information about the fluctuation for the teleportation. In the\nsecond protocol, a harmonic oscillator is coupled with the fluctuation and\nmeasured in order to obtain continuous-variable information about the\nfluctuation. In the spin protocol, the amount of teleported energy is\nsuppressed by an exponential damping factor when the amount of input energy\nincreases. This suppression factor becomes power damping in the case of the\nharmonic oscillator protocol.

Such an\nassumption is valid in the weak field, as verified by precision experiments and\nobservations, but it need not hold in the dynamical strong-field regime where\ntests are lacking. Fundamental bias can cause systematic errors in the\ndetection and parameter estimation of signals, which can lead to a\nmischaracterization of the universe through incorrect inferences about source\nevent rates and populations. We propose a remedy through the introduction of\nthe parameterized post-Einsteinian framework, which consists of the enhancement\nof waveform templates via the inclusion of post-Einsteinian parameters. These\nparameters would ostensibly be designed to interpolate between templates\nconstructed in general relativity and well-motivated alternative theories of\ngravity, and also include extrapolations that follow sound theoretical\nprinciples, such as consistency with conservation laws and symmetries.

We expect to be able to detect and analyze\nmany cycles of these slowly inspiraling systems. To that end, the use of very\nprecise theoretical waveform templates in the data analysis is required. To\nbuild them we need to have a deep understanding of the gravitational\nbackreaction mechanism responsible for the inspiral.

Given an arbitrary set of such charges,\nthere is a generic result for sufficiently late times which corresponds to each\ncharge being surrounded by a field zone with negligible influence from the\nother charges. Furthermore, we explicitly find a static solution in the static\npatch adapted to a charge (implying no energy loss by the charge) which can be\nregularly extended beyond the horizon to the full de Sitter spacetime, and show\nthat any other solution decays at late times to this one.

The\ncompressions induce a phase transition to the cold neutral medium (CNM) to form\ngrowing cold atomic clouds, which in their early stages may constitute thin CNM\nsheets. Several dynamical instabilities soon destabilize a cloud, rendering it\nturbulent. For solar neighborhood conditions, a cloud is coincidentally\nexpected to become molecular, magnetically supercritical, and gravitationally\ndominated at roughly the same column density, $N \\sim 1.5 \\times 10^21 \\psc\n\\approx 10 \\Msun$ pc$^{-2}$.

For the first time, we apply GW extraction methods\nin core collapse that are fully curvature-based and valid for strongly\nradiating and highly relativistic sources.

Accurate starlight subtraction is achieved by referring\nto all-sky star catalogs and a Galactic stellar population synthesis model down\nto 32.0 mag.

The derived COB brightness\nis (1.8 +/- 0.9) x 10^(-9) and (1.2 +/- 0.9) x 10^(-9) erg/s/cm2/sr/A at the\nblue and red band, respectively, or 7.9 +/- 4.0 and 7.7 +/- 5.8 nW/m2/sr.

Specifically, we investigate the possibility of the\nvery massive star (VMS) VFTS 682 being a runaway member of R136. Recent\nobservations of the above VMS, by virtue of its isolated location and its\nmoderate peculiar motion, have raised the fundamental question whether isolated\nmassive star formation is indeed possible. We perform the first realistic\nN-body computations of fully mass-segregated R136-type star clusters in which\nall the massive stars are in primordial binary systems. These calculations\nconfirm that the dynamical ejection of a VMS from a R136-like cluster, with\nkinematic properties similar to those of VFTS 682, is common. Hence the\nconjecture of isolated massive star formation is unnecessary to account for\nthis VMS. Our results are also quite consistent with the ejection of 30 Dor\n016, another suspected runaway VMS from R136. We further note that during the\nclusters' evolution, mergers of massive binaries produce a few single stars per\ncluster with masses significantly exceeding the canonical upper-limit of 150\nsolar mass. The observations of such single super-canonical stars in R136,\ntherefore, do not imply an IMF with an upper limit greatly exceeding the\naccepted canonical 150 solar mass limit, as has been suggested recently, and\nthey are consistent with the canonical upper limit. \n\n"}

In an intermediate regime, with a\nmass range that depends on the uncertain details of rotation and mass loss\nduring the star's life, a NS is initially formed which then experiences\nfallback accretion and collapse to a BH. The electromagnetic consequence of\nsuch an event is not clear. Depending on the progenitor's structure,\npossibilities range from a long gamma-ray burst to a Type II supernova (that\nmay or may not be jet-powered) to a collapse with a weak electromagnetic\nsignature. Gravitational waves (GWs) provide the exciting opportunity to peer\nthrough the envelope of a dying massive star and directly probe what is\noccurring inside. We explore whether fallback onto young NSs can be detected by\nground-based interferometers. When the incoming material has sufficient angular\nmomentum to form a disk, the accretion spins up the NS sufficiently to produce\nnon-axisymmetric instabilities and gravitational radiation at frequencies of\n~700-2400 Hz for ~30-3000 s until collapse to a BH occurs.

Networks of GW interferometers\nhave poor angular resolution on the sky and their EM signatures are predicted\nto be faint.

Photoheating by\nstellar radiation stabilizes gas against Jeans fragmentation, reducing the star\nformation rate. Because we have self-consistently calculated the location of\nionized gas, we are able to make spatially-resolved mock observations of star\nformation tracers, such as H-alpha emission. We can also observe how stellar\nfeedback manifests itself in the correlation between ionized and molecular gas.\nApplying our techniques to the disk in a galactic halo of 2.3e11 Msun, we find\nthat the correlation between star formation rate density (estimated from mock\nH-alpha emission) and molecular hydrogen density shows large scatter,\nespecially at high resolutions of <~ 75 pc that are comparable to the size of\ngiant molecular clouds (GMCs).

In\nprinciple, all of these quantities depend on the neutron star's internal\nstructure, and thus, on unknown nuclear physics at supra-nuclear energy\ndensities.

Three important\nconsequences derive from these I-Love-Q relations. On an observational\nastrophysics front, the measurement of a single member of the I-Love-Q trio\nwould automatically provide information about the other two, even when the\nlatter may not be observationally accessible.

Among\npossible EM emission from the NS merger, emission powered by radioactive\nr-process nuclei is one of the best targets for follow-up observations.\nHowever, prediction so far does not take into account detailed r-process\nelement abundances in the ejecta.

We show that the opacity in the NS merger ejecta is about kappa =\n10 cm^2 g^{-1}, which is higher than that of Fe-rich Type Ia supernova ejecta\nby a factor of ~ 100. As a result, the emission is fainter and longer than\npreviously expected. The spectra are almost featureless due to the high\nexpansion velocity and bound-bound transitions of many different r-process\nelements. We demonstrate that the emission is brighter for a higher mass ratio\nof two NSs and a softer equation of states adopted in the merger simulations.\nBecause of the red color of the emission, follow-up observations in red optical\nand near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths will be the most efficient. At 200 Mpc,\nexpected brightness of the emission is i = 22 - 25 AB mag, z = 21 - 23 AB mag,\nand 21 - 24 AB mag in NIR JHK bands.

This problem was solved in a previous paper by constructing\na spectral representation of the equation of state whose stellar models match a\nprescribed set of macroscopic observables. This paper improves and extends that\nwork in two significant ways: i) The method is made more robust by accounting\nfor an unexpected feature of the enthalpy based representations of the\nequations of state used in this work. After making the appropriate\nmodifications, accurate initial guesses for the spectral parameters are no\nlonger needed so Monte-Carlo techniques can now be used to ensure the best fit\nto the observables. ii) The method is extended here to use masses and tidal\ndeformabilities (which will be measured by gravitational wave observations of\nneutron-star mergers) as the macroscopic observables instead of masses and\nradii. The accuracy and reliability of this extended and more robust spectral\nmethod is evaluated in this paper using mock data for observables from stars\nbased on 34 different theoretical models of the high density neutron-star\nequation of state.

Shells appear as glowing arcs around their\nhost galaxy. They are observed up to ~100 kpc. The stars in axially symmetric\nshell systems move in nearly radial orbits. The radial distributions of shell\nlocations and the spectra of stars in shells can be used to constrain the\ngravitational potential of their host galaxy. The symmetrical shell systems,\nbeing especially suitable for these studies, occur in approximately 3% of all\nearly-type galaxies. Hence the shells substantially increase the number of\nellipticals in which MOND can be tested up to large radii. In this paper, we\nreview our work on shell galaxies in MOND.

{"id": "1407.4563", "contents": "Title: Electron-capture supernovae exploding within their progenitor wind Abstract: The most massive stars on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB), so called\nsuper-AGB stars, are thought to produce supernovae (SNe) triggered by electron\ncaptures in their degenerate O+Ne+Mg cores. Super-AGB stars are expected to\nhave slow winds with high mass-loss rates, so their wind density is high. The\nexplosions of super-AGB stars are therefore presumed to occur in this dense\nwind. We provide the first synthetic light curves (LCs) for such events by\nexploding realistic electron-capture supernova (ecSN) progenitors within their\nsuper-AGB winds. We find that the early LC, i.e. before the recombination wave\nreaches the bottom of the H-rich envelope of SN ejecta (the plateau phase), is\nnot affected by the dense wind. However, after the plateau phase, the\nluminosity remains higher when the super-AGB wind is taken into account. We\ncompare our results to the historical LC of SN 1054, the progenitor of the Crab\nNebula, and show that the explosion of an ecSN within an ordinary super-AGB\nwind can explain the LC features. We conclude that SN 1054 could have been a\nType IIn SN without any extra extreme mass loss which was previously suggested\nto be necessary to account for its early high luminosity. We also show that our\nLCs match Type IIn SNe with an early plateau phase (`Type IIn-P') and suggest\nthat they are ecSNe within super-AGB winds. Although some ecSNe can be bright\nin the optical spectral range due to the large progenitor radius, their X-ray\nluminosity from the interaction does not necessarily get as bright as other\nType IIn SNe whose optical luminosities are also powered by the interaction.\nThus, we suggest that optically-bright X-ray-faint Type IIn SNe can emerge from\necSNe. Optically-faint Type IIn SNe, such as SN 2008S, can also originate from\necSNe if their H-rich envelope masses are small. Some of them can be observed\nas `Type IIn-b' SNe due to the small H-rich envelope mass. \n\n"}

Recent progress in modelling these\nsignals relies on an approximate decoupling between the non-precessing secular\ninspiral and a precession-induced rotation. However, the latter depends in\ngeneral on all physical parameters of the binary which makes modelling efforts\nas well as understanding parameter-estimation prospects prohibitively complex.\nHere we show that the dominant precession effects can be captured by a reduced\nset of spin parameters. Specifically, we introduce a single \\emph{effective\nprecession spin} parameter, $\\chi_p$, which is defined from the spin components\nthat lie in the orbital plane at some (arbitrary) instant during the inspiral.\nWe test the efficacy of this parameter by considering binary inspiral\nconfigurations specified by the physical parameters of a corresponding\nnon-precessing-binary configuration (total mass, mass ratio, and spin\ncomponents (anti-)parallel to the orbital angular momentum), plus the effective\nprecession spin applied to the larger black hole. We show that for an\noverwhelming majority of random precessing configurations, the precession\ndynamics during the inspiral are well approximated by our equivalent\nconfigurations.

In\nthis work, we describe a method for stacking measurements of $\\lambda$ from\nmultiple inspiral events to measure the EOS. We use Markov chain Monte Carlo\nsimulations to estimate the parameters of a 4-parameter piecewise polytrope EOS\nthat matches theoretical EOS models to a few percent. We find that, for\n\"realistic\" event rates ($\\sim 40$ binary neutron star inspiral events per year\nwith signal-to-noise ratio $> 8$ in a single Advanced LIGO detector), combining\na year of gravitational-wave data from a three-detector network with the\nconstraints from causality and recent high mass neutron-star measurements, the\nEOS above nuclear density can be measured to better than a factor of two in\npressure in most cases.

We present\nconstraints on the star formation histories (SFHs) of a sample of LMSFGs\nobtained through the analysis of their spectral energy distributions using a\nnovel approach that (1) consistently combines photometric (broadband) and\nspectroscopic (equivalent widths of emission lines) data, and (2) uses\nphysically motivated SFHs with non-uniform variations of the star formation\nrate (SFR) as a function of time. The sample includes 31 spectroscopically\nconfirmed LMSFGs (7.3 < log M*/Msun < 8.0) at 0.3 < z_spec < 0.9 in the\nExtended-Chandra Deep Field-South field (E-CDF-S).

We then write the canonical energy as $\\mathscr E\\ = \\mathscr K +\n\\mathscr U$, where $\\mathscr K$ and $\\mathscr U$, respectively, denote the\ncanonical energy of the odd part (kinetic energy) and even part (potential\nenergy). One of the main results of this paper is the proof that $\\mathscr K$\nis positive definite for any black hole background. We use $\\mathscr K$ to\nconstruct a Hilbert space $\\mathscr H$ on which time evolution is given in\nterms of a self-adjoint operator $\\tilde {\\mathcal A}$, whose spectrum includes\nnegative values if and only if $\\mathscr U$ fails to be positive. Negative\nspectrum of $\\tilde{\\mathcal A}$ implies exponential growth of the\nperturbations in $\\mathscr H$ that have nontrivial projection into the negative\nspectral subspace. This includes all perturbations of the form $\\pounds_t\n\\delta g$ with negative canonical energy. A \"Rayleigh-Ritz\" type of variational\nprinciple is derived, which can be used to obtain lower bounds on the rate of\nexponential growth. \n\n"}

It is caused by a spiral deformation, the pattern of which rotates\nslower with respect to the double-core structure in center of the remnant. This\nsecondary peak is typically well separated in frequency from the secondary peak\nproduced by a nonlinear interaction between a quadrupole and a quasi-radial\noscillation. The new mechanism allows for an explanation of low-frequency\nmodulations seen in a number of physical characteristics of the remnant, such\nas the central lapse function, the maximum density and the separation between\nthe two cores. We find empirical relations for both types of secondary peaks\nbetween their gravitational-wave frequency and the compactness of nonrotating\nindividual neutron stars, that exist for fixed total binary masses.

The data is then prefiltered against\nthose modes, at fixed intrinsic parameters, enabling efficiently evaluation of\nthe likelihood for generic source positions and orientations, independent of\nwaveform length or generation time. We efficiently parallelize our intrinsic\nspace calculation by integrating over all extrinsic parameters using a Monte\nCarlo integration strategy.

In this letter, we answer this\nquestion quantitatively using simple statistical estimates, deriving the range\nof true signal amplitudes that are compatible with current upper limits, and\ncomputing expected detection probabilities as a function of observation time.\nWe conclude that small arrays consisting of the pulsars with the least timing\nnoise, which yield the tightest upper limits, have discouraging prospects of\nmaking a detection in the next two decades. By contrast, we find large arrays\nare crucial to detection because the quadrupolar spatial correlations induced\nby gravitational waves can be well sampled by many pulsar pairs. Indeed, timing\nprograms which monitor a large and expanding set of pulsars have an $\\sim 80\\%$\nprobability of detecting gravitational waves within the next ten years, under\nassumptions on merger rates and environmental influences ranging from\noptimistic to conservative. Even in the extreme case where $90\\%$ of binaries\nstall before merger and environmental coupling effects diminish low-frequency\ngravitational-wave power, detection is delayed by at most a few years. \n\n"}

Through the merger and\nringdown, however, a different set of degeneracies apply. This suggests the\npossibility that, if the inspiral, merger and ringdown are all within the\nsensitive frequency band of a detector, we may be able to break these\ndegeneracies and more accurately measure both spins. In this work we\ninvestigate our ability to measure individual spins for non-precessing\nbinaries, for a range of configurations and signal strengths, and conclude that\nin general the spin of the larger black hole will be measurable (at best) with\nobservations from Advanced LIGO and Virgo.

The I-Love-Q relations (between\nthe moment of inertia, the tidal deformability and the quadrupole moment) are\nhowever approximately insensitive to this structure. These relations become\nexact for stationary black holes in General Relativity as shown by the no-hair\ntheorems. In this paper, we take the first steps toward studying how the\napproximate I-Love-Q relations become exact in the limit as compact stars\nbecome black holes. To do so, we consider a toy model, i.e. incompressible\nstars with anisotropic pressure, which allows us to model an equilibrium\nsequence of stars with their compactness approaching the black hole limit\narbitrarily closely. We extract the I-Love-Q trio by numerically constructing\nsuch a sequence in the slow-rotation and small-tide approximations. We find\nthat the I-Love-Q relations approach the black hole limit in a nontrivial way,\nwith the quadrupole moment and the tidal deformability changing sign as the\ncompactness and the amount of anisotropy are increased. Generalizing Maclaurin\nspheroids to anisotropic stars, we show that the multipole moments also change\nsign in the Newtonian limit as the amount of anisotropy is increased. We also\nprove analytically that the stellar moment of inertia reaches the black hole\nlimit as the compactness reaches the black hole value in the strongly\nanisotropic limit.

It is therefore a good system to study to understand the relation\nbetween the availability of cold-gas and the triggering of AGNs in galaxies.\nOur new WSRT data reveal two faint, S-shaped radio lobes extending out to\n$\\sim$10 kpc from the galaxy centre. Remarkably, we find that the inner HI disc\nwarps back towards the stellar mid-plane in a way that mirrors the warping of\nthe radio lobes. We suggest that the polar HI disc was accreted through a minor\nmerger, and that the torques causing it to warp in the inner regions are also\nresponsible for feeding the AGN.

In particular, we compute the exchange\nof angular momentum between the core neutron superfluid and the rest of the\nstar within a two-fluid model including both (non-dissipative) entrainment\neffects and (dissipative) mutual friction forces. Our simulations are based on\na quasi-stationary approach using realistic equations of state (EoSs). We show\nthat the evolution of the angular velocities of both fluids can be accurately\ndescribed by an exponential law. The associated characteristic rise time\n$\\tau_{\\text{r}}$, which can be precisely computed from stationary\nconfigurations only, has a form similar to that obtained in the Newtonian\nlimit. However, general relativity changes the structure of the star and leads\nto additional couplings between the fluids due to frame-dragging effects.

Most current models of tidal deformations of\nneutron stars assume that the tidal bulge is directly related to the tidal\nfield generated by the companion, with a constant response coefficient.\nHowever, if the orbital motion approaches a resonance with one of the internal\nmodes of the neutron star, this adiabatic description of tidal effects starts\nto break down, and the tides become dynamical. In this paper, we consider\ndynamical tides in general relativity due to the quadrupolar fundamental\noscillation mode of a neutron star. We devise a description of the effects of\nthe neutron star's finite size on the orbital dynamics based on an effective\npoint-particle action augmented by dynamical quadrupolar degrees of freedom. We\nanalyze the post-Newtonian and test-particle approximations of this model and\nincorporate the results into an effective-one-body Hamiltonian.

These are\ncentrally concentrated blue stars, found in three out of the four nuclear star\nclusters (NSCs) considered here. Their origins are unknown, but could include\nblue straggler (BS) stars, extended horizontal branch stars and young recently\nformed stars. Here, we calculate order-of-magnitude estimates for various\ncollision rates, as a function of the host NSC environment and distance from\nthe cluster centre. These rates are sufficiently high that BSs, formed via\ncollisions between main sequence (MS) stars, could contribute non-negligibly\n($\\sim$ 1-10% in mass) to every surface brightness profile, with the exception\nof the Milky Way. Stellar evolution models show that the envelopes of red giant\nbranch (RGB) stars must be nearly completely stripped to significantly affect\ntheir photometric appearance, which requires multiple collisions. Hence, the\ncollision rates for individual RGB stars are only sufficiently high in the\ninner $\\lesssim$ 0.1 pc of M31 and M32 for RGB destruction to occur.

Some of\nthis uncertainty may be removed through future gravitational wave observations\nof neutron star binaries by extracting the tidal deformabilities (or Love\nnumbers) of neutron stars. Previous studies showed that only a certain\ncombination of the individual deformabilities of each body (chirp tidal\ndeformability) can be measured with second-generation gravitational wave\ninterferometers, such as Adv. LIGO, due to correlations between the individual\ndeformabilities. To overcome this, we search for approximately universal (or\nequation-of-state independent) relations between two combinations of the\nindividual tidal deformabilities, such that once one of them has been measured,\nthe other can be automatically obtained and the individual ones decoupled\nthrough these relations. We find an approximately universal relation between\nthe symmetric and the anti-symmetric combination of the individual tidal\ndeformabilities that is equation-of-state-insensitive to $20\\%$ for binaries\nwith masses less than $1.7M_\\odot$. We show that these relations can be used to\neliminate a combination of the tidal parameters from the list of model\nparameters, thus breaking degeneracies and improving the accuracy in parameter\nestimation. A simple study shows that the universal relations can improve the\naccuracy in the extraction of the symmetric combination of tidal parameters by\nas much as an order of magnitude, making the overall accuracy in the extraction\nof this parameter slightly better than that of the chirp tidal deformability.\nThese new universal relations and the improved measurement accuracy on tidal\nparameters not only are important to astrophysics and nuclear physics, but also\nimpact our ability to probe extreme gravity with gravitational waves and\ncosmology. \n\n"}

This resonant tide can induce phase shift in the\ngravitational waveforms, and potentially provide a new window of studying NS\ninterior using gravitational waves. Previous works have considered tidal\nexcitations of pure g-modes (due to stable stratification of the star) and pure\ninertial modes (due to Coriolis force), with the rotational effect treated in\nan approximate manner. However, for realistic NSs, the buoyancy and rotational\neffects can be comparable, giving rise to mixed inertial-gravity modes. We\ndevelop a non-perturbative numerical spectral code to compute the frequencies\nand tidal coupling coefficients of these modes. We then calculate the phase\nshift in the gravitational waveform due to each resonance during binary\ninspiral. We adopt polytropic NS models with a parameterized stratification. We\nderive relevant scaling relations and survey how the phase shift depends on\nvarious properties of the NS. We find that for canonical NSs (with mass M =\n1.4M_sun and radius R = 10 km) and modest rotation rates (< 300 Hz), the\ngravitational wave phase shift due to a resonance is generally less than 0.01\nradian. But the phase shift is a strong function of R and M, and can reach a\nradian or more for low-mass NSs with larger radii (R > 15 km). Significant\nphase shift can also be produced when the combination of stratification and\nrotation gives rise to a very low frequency (< 20 Hz in the inertial frame)\nmodified g-mode. We also find that some inertial modes can be strongly affected\nby stratification, and that the m = 1 r-mode, previously identified to have a\nsmall but finite inertial-frame frequency based on the Cowling approximation,\nin fact has essentially zero frequency, and therefore cannot be excited. \n\n"}

One such set of universal relations between the moment of inertia $(I)$,\nthe tidal Love number and the quadrupole moment $(Q)$ has been studied both in\nGeneral Relativity and in modified theories. In this paper, we study the\nrelations in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity, a well-motivated, parity-violating\neffective field theory, extending previous work in various ways. First, we\nstudy how projected constraints on the theory using the I-Love relation depend\non the measurement accuracy of $I$ with radio observations and that of the Love\nnumber with gravitational-wave observations.

For the preferred F110W passband we derive a distance modulus\nof $m{-}M=33.05\\pm0.08\\pm0.10$ mag, or a linear distance $d=40.7\\pm1.4\\pm1.9$\nMpc (random and systematic errors, respectively); a virtually identical result\nis obtained from the F160W data. This is the most precise distance to NGC4993\navailable to date. Combining our distance measurement with the corrected\nrecession velocity of NGC4993 implies a Hubble constant $H_0=71.9\\pm\n7.1~km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}$. A comparison of our result to the GW-inferred value of\n$H_0$ indicates a binary orbital inclination of $i\\,{\\gtrsim}\\,137~\\deg$.

However, the\ngravitational-wave signal emitted by an inspiraling binary neutron star system\nis only weakly dependent on the equation of state and extracting this\ninformation is challenging. Previous studies have focused mainly on binary\nsystems where the neutron stars are spinning slowly and the main imprint of\nneutron star matter in the inspiral signal is due to tidal effects.

Here we explore whether highly spinning binary\nneutron-star systems offer a better chance to measure the equation-of-state\nthan weakly spinning binary-neutron star systems. We focus on the dominant\nadiabatic quadrupolar effects and consider three main questions. First, we show\nthat equation-of-state effects can be significant in the inspiral waveforms,\nand that the spin-quadrupole effect dominates for rapidly rotating neutron\nstars. Second, we show that variations in the spin-quadrupole phasing are\nstrongly degenerate with changes in the component masses and spins, and\nneglecting these terms has a negligible impact on the number of observations\nwith second generation observatories.

Here we find that\nthe first six binary black hole (BBH) merging events reported by LIGO/Virgo\nshow clear evidence for lensing in the plane of observed mass and source\ndistance. The four lowest frequency events follow an apparent locus in this\nplane, which we can reproduce by galaxy lensing, where the higher the\nmagnification, the generally more distant the source so the wave train is\nstretched more by the Universal expansion, by factors of 2-4. This revises the\nreported BBH distances upwards by an order of magnitude, equal to the square\nroot of the magnification. Furthermore, the reported black hole masses must be\ndecreased by 2-4 to counter the larger stretch factor, since the orbital\nfrequency is used to derive the black hole masses. This lowers the masses to\n5-15 solar masses, well below the puzzlingly high values of 20-35 solar masses\notherwise estimated, with the attraction of finding agreement in mass with\nblack holes orbiting stars in our own Galaxy, thereby implying a stellar origin\nfor the low frequency events in the far Universe.

The total Fornax dwarf\ngalaxy population from NGFS and other catalogs rises, therefore, to a total of\n643 with 181 being nucleated, yielding an overall nucleation fraction of\n$28\\%$. The absolute $i'$-band magnitudes for the outer NGFS dwarfs are in the\nrange $-18.80\\le\\,M_{i'}\\le\\,-8.78$ with effective radii $r_{{\\rm\neff},i'}\\,=\\,0.18-2.22$ kpc and an average Sersic index $\\langle\nn\\rangle_{i'}\\,=\\,0.81$. Non-nucleated dwarfs are found to be fainter and\nsmaller by $\\Delta\\langle M_{i'}\\rangle\\!=\\!2.25$ mag and $\\Delta\\langle\nr_{{\\rm eff},i'}\\rangle\\!=\\!0.4$ kpc than the nucleated dwarfs. We demonstrate\na significant clustering of dwarf galaxies on scales $\\lesssim\\!100$ kpc, and\nprojected surface number density profile estimates, $\\Sigma_N(r)$, show a\nconcentration of dwarfs in the Fornax core region within $r\\!\\sim\\!350$ kpc.\n$\\Sigma_N(r)$ has a flat distribution up to $\\sim\\!350$ kpc, beyond which it\ndeclines for the non-nucleated dwarfs.

Using the single-orbital-averaged\nand double-orbital-averaged secular dynamics equations of triples, we determine\nthe merger window (the range of companion inclinations that allows the inner\nbinary to merge) and the merger fraction as a function of various system\nparameters. For typical BH binaries, the merger fraction increases rapidly with\nthe perturber eccentricity $e_{\\rm out}$ because of the octupole perturbation,\nreaching $10-20\\%$ at $e_{\\rm out}=0.9$. We derive the analytical expressions\nfor the merger window and merger fraction for systems with negligible octupole\neffect, and apply them to neutron star binary mergers in triples.

Here we demonstrate that\nsimilar abundance patterns are also present in Milky Way-like galaxies in the\nEAGLE cosmological hydrodynamical simulation, where these patterns originate\nfrom the fact that stars may form from gas enriched predominantly by asymptotic\ngiant branch (AGB) stars or by type-II supernovae. This occurs when stars form\nin the poorly mixed interstellar medium of Milky Way progenitor galaxies that\nare undergoing bursty star formation. The CEMP-no stars with lower [C/Mg] form\nat the onset of a starburst from gas enriched by low metallicity type-II\nsupernovae that power a strong outflow, quenching further star formation. When\nstar formation resumes following cosmological gas accretion, the CEMP-no stars\nwith higher [C/Mg] form, with enrichment by AGB ejecta evident in their higher\nabundance of barium and lower abundance of magnesium. This suggests that bursty\nstar formation in the progenitors of the Galaxy leaves a permanent imprint in\nthe abundance patterns of CEMP stars. \n\n"}

Here, we use the EAGLE cosmological hydrodynamical\nsimulation to study the mass dependence, evolution and origin of scatter in the\nSFR-M$_{\\rm star}$ relation.

A\nparameter which is common to and plays a key role in both the GW and the EM\nanalyses is the viewing angle of the binary's orbit. If a binary is viewed from\ndifferent angles, the amount of GW energy changes (implying that orientation\nand distance are correlated) and the EM signatures can vary, depending on the\nstructure of the emission. Information about the viewing angle of the binary\norbital plane is therefore crucial to the interpretation of both the GW and the\nEM data, and can potentially be extracted from either side.\n  In the first part of this study, we present a systematic analysis of how well\nthe viewing angle of binary neutron stars can be measured from the GW data.

We reanalyze their data with\nfully-precessing NR-surrogate templates and freely provide the resulting\nposterior samples as supplemental material.

Using the first six black-hole merger observations,\nwe are able to constrain the distribution of black-hole spins.

This\npost-Newtonian gravitomagnetic driving of these modes dominates over the\nNewtonian tidal driving previously computed by Ho and Lai. To leading order in\nthe tidal expansion parameter R/r (where R is the radius of the neutron star\nand r is the orbital separation), only the l=2, |m|= 1 and |m| = 2 r-modes are\nexcited. The tidal work done on the star through this driving has an effect on\nthe evolution of the inspiral and on the phasing of the emitted gravitational\nwave signal. For a neutron star of mass M, radius R, spin frequency f_spin,\nmodeled as a Gamma =2 polytrope, with a companion also of mass M, the\ngravitational wave phase shift for the m=2 mode is\n(0.1radians)(R/10km)^4(M/1.4M_sun)^{-10/3}(f_spin/100Hz)^{2/3} for optimal spin\norientation.

Thus\nwormhole horizons are two-way traversible, while black-hole and white-hole\nhorizons are only one-way traversible. It follows from the Einstein equation\nthat the null energy condition is violated everywhere on a generic wormhole\nhorizon. It is suggested that quantum inequalities constraining negative energy\nbreak down at such horizons. Wormhole dynamics can be developed as for\nblack-hole dynamics, including a reversed second law and a first law involving\na definition of wormhole surface gravity. Since the causal nature of a horizon\ncan change, being spatial under positive energy and temporal under sufficient\nnegative energy, black holes and wormholes are interconvertible. In particular,\nif a wormhole's negative-energy source fails, it may collapse into a black\nhole. Conversely, irradiating a black-hole horizon with negative energy could\nconvert it into a wormhole horizon.

It is argued that when\nenvironment-induced decoherence is taken into account, the experimental\npredictions of the MWI are identical to those of the Copenhagen interpretation\nexcept for an experiment involving a Byzantine form of ``quantum suicide''.\nThis makes the choice between them purely a matter of taste, roughly equivalent\nto whether one believes mathematical language or human language to be more\nfundamental. \n\n"}
