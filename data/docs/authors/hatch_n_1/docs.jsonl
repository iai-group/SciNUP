We constrain a\nmass-to-'observed' light ratio, M_h/L_band. For narrow-band surveys, L_band is\nsimply related to the intrinsic Ly-alpha luminosity with a survival fraction of\nLy-alpha photons, alpha_esc. The mass-to-'bolometric light', M_h/L_bol, can\nalso be deduced, once the metallicity and stellar mass spectrum are given. The\ninferred M_h/L_bol is more sensitive to metallicity than to the mass spectrum.\nWe find the following constraints on a mass-to-light ratio of Ly-alpha emitters\nfrom 5.7 < z < 7: (M_h/L_bol)(alpha_{esc}epsilon^{1/gamma})^{-1}=21-38, 14-26,\nand 9-17 for Z=0, 1/50, and 1 Z_sun, respectively, where epsilon is the 'duty\ncycle' of Ly-alpha emitters, and gamma ~ 2 is a local slope of the cumulative\nluminosity function. Only weak lower limits are obtained for z=8.8. Therefore,\nLy-alpha emitters are consistent with either starburst galaxies M_h/L_bol ~\n0.1-1 with a smaller Ly-alpha survival fraction, alpha_{esc}epsilon^{1/gamma}\n~0.01-0.05, or normal populations (M_h/L_bol ~ 10) if a good fraction of\nLy-alpha photons survived, alpha_{esc}epsilon^{1/gamma} ~ 0.5-1.

The former type of outflow could be ejecta that is\nejected during the prompt phase of a GRB and consists of a series of baryonic\nshells with a distribution of Lorentz factors, and the latter type could be an\nelectron-positron-pair wind that is driven by the post-burst central engine. We\nhere provide a unified description for the dynamics of fireballs based on these\ntwo types of energy injection, and calculate the corresponding high-energy\nphoton emission by considering synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton\nscattering (including synchrotron self-Compton and combined inverse-Compton) of\nelectrons. We find that, in the two energy-injection models, there is a plateau\n(even a hump) in high-energy light curves during the X-ray shallow decay phase.\nIn particular, a considerable fraction of the injecting energy in the\nlepton-dominated model can be shared by the long-lasting reverse shock since it\nis relativistic.

Abstract: The evolution of the galaxy stellar mass--star formation rate relationship\n(M*-SFR) provides key constraints on the stellar mass assembly histories of\ngalaxies. For star-forming galaxies, M*-SFR is observed to be fairly tight with\na slope close to unity from z~0-2. Simulations of galaxy formation reproduce\nthese trends owing to the generic dominance of smooth and steady cold accretion\nin these systems. In contrast, the amplitude of the M*-SFR relation evolves\nmarkedly differently than in models. Stated in terms of a star formation\nactivity parameter alpha=(M*/SFR)/(t_H-1 Gyr), models predict a constant\nalpha~1 out to redshifts z=4+, while the observed M*-SFR relation indicates\nthat alpha increases by X3 from z~2 until today. The low alpha at high-z not\nonly conflicts with models, but is also difficult to reconcile with other\nobservations of high-z galaxies. Systematic biases could significantly affect\nmeasurements of M* and SFR, but detailed considerations suggest that none are\nobvious candidates to reconcile the discrepancy. A speculative solution is\nconsidered in which the stellar initial mass function (IMF) evolves towards\nmore high-mass star formation at earlier epochs.

The predicted metallicity spread due to\nself-enrichment alone, a robust prediction of the model, is much smaller than\nthe observed spread among real GCs.

The linear analysis shows that the power spectrum\nbelow the so-called filtering scale is suppressed relative to the power\nspectrum of the cold dark matter. Our non-linear calculation shows that the\nactual filtering scale for a given sound speed is smaller than the linear\nfiltering scale by a factor depending on the redshift and the Jeans length.

The chameleon mechanism can screen the scalar charge for\nlarge objects but not for small ones (large/small is defined by the\ngravitational potential and controlled by the scalar coupling). This leads to\norder one fluctuations in the inertial to gravitational mass ratio. In Jordan\nframe, it is no longer true that all objects move on geodesics. In contrast, if\nthe scalar screening occurrs via strong coupling, such as in the DGP braneworld\nmodel, equivalence principle violation occurrs at a much reduced level. We\npropose several observational tests of the chameleon mechanism: 1. small\ngalaxies should fall faster than large galaxies, even when dynamical friction\nis negligible; 2. voids defined by small galaxies would be larger compared to\nstandard expectations; 3. stars and diffuse gas in small galaxies should have\ndifferent velocities, even on the same orbits; 4. lensing and dynamical mass\nestimates should agree for large galaxies but disagree for small ones.

We quantify the presence of a long tail in the\nformation rate of metal-free halos during late stages of reionization (redshift\nz~6), which might offer the best window to detect Population III stars. Using\ncosmological simulations for the growth of dark matter halos, coupled with\nanalytical recipes for the metal enrichment of their interstellar medium, we\nshow that pockets of metal-free gas exist at z~6 even under the assumption of\nhigh efficiency in metal pollution via winds. A comoving metal-free halo\nformation rate d^2n/dtdV > 10^{-9} Mpc^{-3}yr^{-1} is expected at z=6 for halos\nwith virial temperature T_{vir}~10^4 K (mass ~10^8 Msun), sufficient to\ninitiate cooling even with strong negative radiative feedback.

Since all\nnecessary stellar mass exists in the galaxy at z=1.4, no star-formation or\naddition of external stellar material is required, only a redistribution e.g.\ninduced by minor and major merging or through disk instabilities. Merging, in\naddition to redistributing mass in the galaxy, will add both BH and\nstellar/bulge mass, but does not change the overall final M_BH/M_(*,bulge)\nratio.\n  Since the overall cosmic stellar and BH mass buildup trace each other tightly\nover time, our scenario of bulge-formation in massive galaxies is independent\nof any strong BH-feedback and means that the mechanism coupling BH and bulge\nmass until the present is very indirect. \n\n"}

This is at least partially due to the fact that if the binary is\nhard enough to evolve to the phase at which it will start emitting\ngravitational waves (GWs) efficiently, there is a good probability that it will\nbe detectable by future space-borne detectors like LISA.

The\nfolding, which becomes increasingly complex with time, leads to an apparent\nvelocity dispersion increase and thickening of the stream. We measure the\nequivalent velocity dispersion around the local mean in the simulations,\nfinding that it rises to about 10 km/s after 5 Gyr and 20 km/s after 13 Gyr.\nThe currently available measurements of the velocity dispersion of halo star\nstreams range from as small as 2 km/s to slightly over 20 km/s. The streams\nwith velocity dispersions of 15-20 km/s are compatible with what sub-halo\nheating would produce. A dynamical understanding of the low velocity dispersion\nstreams depends on the time since the progenitor's tidal disruption into a thin\nstream. If the streams are nearly as old as their stars then sub-halos cannot\nbe present with the predicted numbers and masses. However, the dynamical age of\nthe streams can be significantly less than the stars. If the three lowest\nvelocity streams are assigned ages of 3 Gyr, they are in conflict with the\nsub-halo heating.

The fraction of\ngalaxies with early-type morphologies increases monotonically with M_B\nluminosity and stellar mass and with cosmic epoch.

We find that the predicted epicyclic overdensities arise in any\ntidal tail no matter which orbit the cluster follows as long as the cluster\nlives long enough for the overdensities to build up.\n  The distance of the overdensities along the tidal tail from the cluster\ncentre depends for circular orbits only on the mass of the cluster and the\nstrength of the tidal field, and therefore decreases monotonically with time,\nwhile for eccentric orbits the orbital motion influences the distance, causing\na periodic compression and stretching of the tails and making the distance\noscillate with time. We provide an approximation for estimating the distance of\nthe overdensities in this case.\n  We describe an additional type of overdensity which arises in extended tidal\ntails of clusters on eccentric orbits, when the acceleration of the tidal field\non the stellar stream is no longer homogeneous. Moreover, we conclude that a\npericentre passage or a disk shock is not the direct origin of an overdensity\nwithin a tidal tail. Escape due to such tidal perturbations does not take place\nimmediately after the perturbation but is rather delayed and spread over the\norbit of the cluster. All observable overdensities are therefore of the\nmentioned two types.

This paper presents analytical estimates for the\nsignal to noise (S/N) for measurements of the cross-correlation between the\nflux decrement and the convergence and for measurements of the\ncross-correlation between the variance in flux decrement and the convergence.\nFor the ongoing BOSS (SDSS III) and Planck surveys, we estimate an S/N of 30\nand 9.6 for these two correlations. For the proposed BigBOSS and ACTPOL\nsurveys, we estimate an S/N of 130 and 50 respectively. Since the\ncross-correlation between the variance in flux decrement and the convergence is\nproportional to the fourth power of $\\sigma_8$, the amplitude of these\ncross-correlations can potentially be used to measure the amplitude of\n$\\sigma_8$ at z~2 to 2.5% with BOSS and Planck and even better with future data\nsets. These measurements have the potential to test alternative theories for\ndark energy and to constrain the mass of the neutrino. The large potential\nsignal estimated in our analytical calculations motivate tests with non-linear\nhydrodynamical simulations and analyses of upcoming data sets. \n\n"}

Thermal Comptonisation by a hot electron cloud is a widely\naccepted mechanism accounting for its high energy emission, while the nature of\nmost of its soft X-ray output is not completely understood. A further low\nenergy component is typically needed to model the observed spectra: pure\nblackbody and Comptonisation-modified blackbody radiation by a lower\ntemperature (a few keV) electron plasma were suggested to explain the low\nenergy data. We studied the steady emission of GS 1826-238 by means of broad\nband (X to soft Gamma-rays) measurements obtained by the INTEGRAL observatory\nin 2003 and 2006. The newly developed, up-to-date Comptonisation model CompTB\nis applied for the first time to study effectively the low-hard state\nvariability of a low-luminosity neutron star in a low-mass X-ray binary system.\nWe confirm that the 3-200 keV emission of \\GS is characterised by\nComptonisation of soft seed photons by a hot electron plasma. A single spectral\ncomponent is sufficient to model the observed spectra. At lower energies, no\ndirect blackbody emission is observed and there is no need to postulate a low\ntemperature Compton region. Compared to the 2003 measurements, the plasma\ntemperature decreased from 20 to 14 keV in 2006, together with the seed photons\ntemperature.

We generate initial conditions for our simulations of galactic\nnuclei (<~300pc) using galaxy scale simulations, including both major mergers\nand isolated bar-(un)stable disk galaxies. For sufficiently gas-rich,\ndisk-dominated systems, a series of gravitational instabilities generates large\naccretion rates of up to 1-10 M_sun/yr onto the BH (at <<0.1pc); sufficient to\nfuel the most luminous quasars. The BH accretion rate is highly time variable,\ngiven fixed conditions at ~kpc.

The campaign consists of 7 observations. We analyze the\nresponse in the opacity of the gas that forms the ionized absorber to ionizing\nflux variations. Despite variations by a factor of 4 in the impinging\ncontinuum, the soft X-ray spectra of the source show little spectral\nvariations, suggesting no response from the ionized absorber. A detailed time\nmodeling confirms the lack of opacity variations for an absorbing component\nwith high ionization. Instead, the models tentatively suggest that the\nionization parameter of a low ionization absorbing component might be changing\nwith the ionizing flux, as expected for gas in photoionization equilibrium.\nUsing the lack of variations, we set an upper limit of n_e <2.0E7 cm-3 for the\nelectron density of the gas forming the high ionization, high velocity\ncomponent. This implies a large distance from the continuum source (R > 0.033\npc). If the variations in the low ionization component are real, they imply n_e\n>9.8E4 cm-3 and R < 3 pc.

The Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability strips gas from these clouds. If the pressure and the the\nmetallicity of the corona are high enough, the stripped gas causes a similar\nmass of coronal gas to condense in the cloud's wake.

These confirm the existence of a\ncritical ablation rate above which the corona is condensed, and imply that for\nthe likely parameters of the Galactic corona this rate lies near the actual\nablation rate of clouds.

Several authors have claimed to detect a significant cross-correlation\nbetween microwave WMAP anisotropies and the SDSS galaxy distribution. We repeat\nthese analyses to determine the different cross-correlation uncertainties\ncaused by re-sampling errors and field-to-field fluctuations. The first type of\nerror concerns overlapping sky regions, while the second type concerns\nnon-overlapping sky regions. METHODS. To measure the re-sampling errors, we use\nbootstrap and jack-knife techniques. For the field-to-field fluctuations, we\nuse three methods: 1) evaluation of the dispersion in the cross-correlation\nwhen correlating separated regions of WMAP with the original region of SDSS; 2)\nuse of mock Monte Carlo WMAP maps; 3) a new method (developed in this article),\nwhich measures the error as a function of the integral of the product of the\nself-correlations for each map. RESULTS. The average cross-correlation for b>30\ndeg. is significantly stronger than the re-sampling errors--both the jack-knife\nand bootstrap techniques provide similar results--but it is of the order of the\nfield-to-field fluctuations. This is confirmed by the cross-correlation between\nanisotropies and galaxies in more than the half of the sample being null within\nre-sampling errors. CONCLUSIONS. Re-sampling methods underestimate the errors.\nField-to-field fluctuations dominate the detected signals. The ratio of signal\nto re-sampling errors is larger than unity in a way that strongly depends on\nthe selected sky region.

Numerical simulations showed that such turbulence is\nsub-sonic in the first star-forming minihalos, and highly supersonic in the\nfirst galaxies with virial temperatures larger than 10^4 K. We investigate the\nmagnetic field amplification during the collapse both for Kolmogorov and\nBurgers-type turbulence with a semi-analytic model that incorporates the\neffects of gravitational compression and small-scale dynamo amplification. We\nfind that the magnetic field may be substantially amplified before the\nformation of a disk. On scales of 1/10 of the Jeans length, saturation occurs\nafter ~10^8 yr. Although the saturation behaviour of the small-scale dynamo is\nstill somewhat uncertain, we expect a saturation field strength of the order\n~10^{-7} n^{0.5} G in the first star-forming halos, with n the number density\nin cgs units. In the first galaxies with higher turbulent velocities, the\nmagnetic field strength may be increased by an order of magnitude, and\nsaturation may occur after 10^6 to 10^7 yr.

{"id": "1004.3874", "contents": "Title: Loss of halo triaxiality due to bar formation Abstract: Cosmological N-body simulations indicate that the dark matter haloes of\ngalaxies should be generally triaxial. Yet, the presence of a baryonic disc is\nbelieved to alter the shape of the haloes. Here we aim to study how bar\nformation is affected by halo triaxiality and how, in turn, the presence of the\nbar influences the shape of the halo. We perform a set of collisionless N-body\nsimulations of disc galaxies with triaxial dark matter haloes, using elliptical\ndiscs as initial conditions. We study models of different halo triaxialities\nand, to investigate the behaviour of the halo shape in the absence of bar\nformation, we run models with different disc masses, halo concentrations, disc\nvelocity dispersions and also models where the disc shape is kept artificially\naxisymmetric. We find that the introduction of a massive disc causes the halo\ntriaxiality to be partially diluted. Once the disc is fully grown, a strong\nstellar bar develops within the halo that is still non-axisymmetric, causing it\nto lose its remaining non-axisymmetry. In triaxial haloes in which the initial\nconditions are such that a bar does not form, the halo is able to remain\ntriaxial and the circularisation of its shape on the plane of the disc is\nlimited to the period of disc growth. We conclude that part of the\ncircularisation of the halo is due to disc growth, but part must be attributed\nto the formation of a bar. We find that initially circular discs respond\nexcessively to the triaxial potential and become highly elongated. They also\nlose more angular momentum than the initially elliptical discs and thus form\nstronger bars. Because of that, the circularisation that their bars induce on\ntheir haloes is also more rapid. We also analyse halo vertical shapes and\nobserve that their vertical flattenings remain considerable, meaning that the\nhaloes become approximately oblate by the end of the simulations.

In our model, subtraction of residual scattered quasar light\nis performed, while simultaneously modeling the constituent stellar populations\nof the host galaxy. The reliability of this technique is tested via a\nMonte-Carlo routine in which the correspondence between synthetic spectra with\nknown parameters and the model output is determined.

We measure extinctions\ndirectly from the Balmer decrement of each source, and while higher values of\nextinction are associated with an increase in any of the three parameters, we\ndemonstrate that the fundamental property that governs extinction is stellar\nmass. After this mass-dependent relationship is removed, there is very little\nsystematic dependence of the residual extinctions with either SFR or\nmetallicity, and no significant improvement is obtained from a more general\nparameterisation.

Using toy\ntemperature models and detailed heating histories from cosmological simulations\nof HeII reionization, we study the consequences of inhomogeneous heating for\nthe Ly-alpha forest. The impact of temperature fluctuations in physically\nwell-motivated models can be surprisingly subtle. In fact, we show that\ntemperature fluctuations at the level predicted by our reionization simulations\ndo not give rise to detectable signatures in the types of statistics that have\nbeen employed previously. However, because of the aliasing of small-scale\ndensity power to larger scale modes in the line-of-sight Ly-alpha forest power\nspectrum, earlier analyses were not sensitive to 3D modes with >~ 30 comoving\nMpc wavelengths -- scales where temperature fluctuations are likely to be\nrelatively largest. The ongoing Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS)\naims to measure the 3D power spectrum of the Ly-alpha forest, P_F, from a large\nsample of quasars in order to avoid this aliasing.

We exploited the spectral archive of the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey (SDSS) to create a sample of more than 9000 quasars in the\nStripe 82. The quasar catalogue was matched with the Light Motion Curve\nCatalogue for SDSS Stripe 82 and individual first-order structure functions\nwere computed. The structure functions are used to create a variability\nindicator that is related to the same intrinsic timescales for all quasars (1\nto 2 yr in the rest frame). We study the variability ratios for adjacent SDSS\nfilter bands as a function of redshift. While variability is almost always\nstronger in the bluer passband compared to the redder, the variability ratio\ndepends on whether strong emission lines contribute to either one band or the\nother. The variability ratio-redshift relations resemble the corresponding\ncolour index-redshift relations. From the comparison with Monte Carlo\nsimulations of variable quasar spectra we find that the observed variability\nratio-redshift relations are closely fitted assuming that (a) the r.m.s.\nfluctuation of the quasar continuum follows a power law-dependence on the\nintrinsic wavelength with an exponent -2 (i.e., bluer when brighter) and (b)\nthe variability of the emission line flux is only about 10% of that of the\nunderlying continuum. These results, based upon the photometry of more than\n8000 quasars, confirm the previous findings by Wilhite et al. (2005) from 315\nquasars with repeated SDSS spectroscopy. Finally, we find that quasars with\nunusual spectra and weak emission lines tend to have less variability than\nconventional quasars. This trend is opposite to what is expected from the\ndilution effect of variability due to line emission and may be indicative of\nhigh Eddington ratios in these unconventinal quasars. \n\n"}

However, there are few detailed multiwavelength studies of\nMarkarian 501 during its quiescent state, due to its low luminosity.

Color Gradients of Globular Cluster\n  Systems in Early-Type Galaxies Abstract: We use the largest homogeneous sample of globular clusters (GCs), drawn from\nthe ACSVCS and ACSFCS, to investigate the color gradients of GC systems in 76\nearly-type galaxies. We find that most GC systems possess an obvious negative\ngradient in g-z color (bluer outwards). For GC systems displaying color\nbimodality, both metal-rich and metal-poor GC subpopulations present shallower\nbut significant color gradients on average, and the mean gradients of these two\nsubpopulations are of roughly equal strength. The FOV of ACS mainly restricts\nus to measuring the inner gradients of GC systems. These gradients, however,\ncan introduce an aperture bias when measuring the mean colors of GC\nsubpopulations from relatively narrow central pointings. Inferred corrections\nto previous work imply a reduced significance for the relation between the mean\ncolor of metal-poor GCs and their host galaxy luminosity. The GC color\ngradients also show a dependence with host galaxy mass where the gradiens are\nweakest at the ends of the mass spectrum--in massive galaxies and dwarf\ngalaxies--and strongest in galaxies of intermediate mass, around a stellar mass\nof M_stellar~10^10M_sun. We also measure color gradients for field stars in the\nhost galaxies. We find that GC color gradients are systematically steeper than\nfield star color gradients, but the shape of the gradient-mass relation is the\nsame for both. If gradients are caused by rapid dissipational collapse and\nweakened by merging, these color gradients support a picture where the inner GC\nsystems of most intermediate-mass and massive galaxies formed early and rapidly\nwith the most massive galaxies having experienced greater merging. The lack of\nstrong gradients in the GC systems of dwarfs, which probably have not\nexperienced many recent major mergers, suggests that low mass halos were\ninefficient at retaining and mixing metals during the epoch of GC formation. \n\n"}

Abstract: Nearby spiral galaxies show an extremely tight correlation between tracers of\nmolecular hydrogen (H_2) in the interstellar medium (ISM) and tracers of recent\nstar formation, but it is unclear whether this correlation is fundamental or\naccidental. In the galaxies that have been surveyed to date, H_2 resides\npredominantly in gravitationally bound clouds cooled by carbon monoxide (CO)\nmolecules, but in galaxies of low metal content the correlations between bound\nclouds, CO, and H_2 break down, and it is unclear if the star formation rate\nwill then correlate with H_2 or with some other quantity.

This is\nnot because H_2 is directly important for cooling, but instead because the\ntransition from predominantly atomic hydrogen (HI) to H_2 occurs under the same\nconditions as a dramatic drop in gas temperature and Bonnor-Ebert mass that\ndestabilizes clouds and initiates collapse.

Motivated by this fact, we\nexplore the possibility of extending the electromagnetic theory by allowing the\nscalar state which is usually eliminated by means of the Lorenz condition to\npropagate, preserving at the same time the dynamics of ordinary transverse\nphotons. We show that the new state cannot be generated by charged currents,\nbut it breaks conformal invariance and can be excited gravitationally. In fact,\nprimordial quantum fluctuations produced during inflation can give rise to\nsuper-Hubble temporal electromagnetic modes whose energy density behaves as a\ncosmological constant. The value of the effective cosmological constant is\nshown to agree with observations provided inflation took place at the\nelectroweak scale. The theory is compatible with all the local gravity tests\nand is free from classical or quantum instabilities. Thus we see that, not only\nthe true nature of dark energy can be established without resorting to new\nphysics, but also the value of the cosmological constant finds a natural\nexplanation in the context of standard inflationary cosmology. On sub-Hubble\nscales, the new state generates an effective charge density which, due to the\nhigh electric conductivity of the cosmic plasma after inflation, gives rise to\nboth vorticity and magnetic fields. Present upper limits on vorticity coming\nfrom CMB anisotropies are translated into lower limits on the present value of\ncosmic magnetic fields.

M87 (NGC\n4486) and Centaurus A (NGC 5128, CenA) are well-studied nearby LLAGNs. As an\nadditional feature they show gamma-radiation up to TeV (10^{12}eV) energies,\nbut the origin of this radiation is not resolved. The coincident observation of\na radio and TeV flare in M87 suggests that the TeV radiation is produced within\naround 50-100 gravitational radii of the central supermassive black hole,\ndepending on the assumed value of the mass of the black hole. Strong radiation\nfields can be produced in the central region of an (LL)AGN, e.g., by the\naccretion flow around the black hole, the jet plasma, or stars closely orbiting\nthe black hole. These radiation fields can lead to the absorption of emitted\nTeV photons, and in fact high optical depths of such fields can make TeV\ndetection from inner regions impossible. In this paper we consider the\naccretion flow around the black hole as the most prominent source for such a\nradiation field and we accordingly calculate the probability for absorption of\nTeV photons produced near the black holes in M87 and CenA assuming a low\nluminosity Shakura-Sunyaev Disk (SSD).

While the inner region of M87 is\ntransparent for TeV radiation up to 15TeV, the optical depth in CenA is >> 1,\nleading to an absorption of TeV photons that might be produced near the central\nblack hole. These results imply either that the TeV gamma production sites and\nprocesses are different for both sources, or that LLAGN black holes do not\naccrete (at least only) in form of a low luminosity SSD. \n\n"}

Simultaneously, the asymmetry of a\ngalaxy's stellar disk, in combination with other morphological parameters, has\nseen extensive use as an indication of recent merger or interaction in galaxy\nsamples. Quantified morphology of stellar spiral disks is one avenue to\ndetermine the merger rate over much of the age of the Universe. In this paper,\nwe measure the quantitative morphology parameters for the HI column density\nmaps from the Westerbork observations of neutral Hydrogen in Irregular and\nSPiral galaxies (WHISP). These are Concentration, Asymmetry, Smoothness, Gini,\nM20, and one addition of our own, the Gini parameter of the second order moment\n(GM). Our aim is to determine if lopsided or interacting disks can be\nidentified with these parameters. Our sample of 141 HI maps have all previous\nclassifications on their lopsidedness and interaction. We find that the\nAsymmetry, M20, and our new GM parameter correlate only weakly with the\nprevious morphological lopsidedness quantification. These three parameters may\nbe used to compute a probability that an HI disk is morphologically lopsided\nbut not unequivocally to determine it. However, we do find that that the\nquestion whether or not an HI disk is interacting can be settled well using\nmorphological parameters. Parameter cuts from the literature do not translate\nfrom ultraviolet to HI directly but new selection criteria using combinations\nof Asymmetry and M20 or Concentration and M20, work very well. We suggest that\nfuture all-sky HI surveys may use these parameters of the column density maps\nto determine the merger fraction and hence rate in the local Universe with a\nhigh degree of accuracy. \n\n"}

These galaxies are found to be strongly concentrated towards the cores of\nthe five clusters that make up the SSC, and also appear rare among local field\ngalaxies, confirming them as a cluster-specific phenomenon. Their optical\nspectra and lack of significant UV emission imply little or no ongoing star\nformation, while fits to their panchromatic SEDs require the far-IR emission to\ncome mostly from a diffuse dust component heated by the general interstellar\nradiation field rather than ongoing star formation.

The system consists of a (5+1)-dimensional model with a flux-stabilized\nsupersymmetric bulk coupled to non-supersymmetric matter localized on a\n(3+1)-dimensional positive-tension brane. We use recent techniques for\ncalculating how extra dimensions respond to changes in brane properties to show\n(at the classical level) that the low-energy 4D geometry is exactly flat,\nindependent of the value of the brane tensions. Its mechanism for doing so is\nthe transfer of stabilizing flux between the bulk and the branes. The UV\ncompletion of the model can arise at scales much larger than M, allowing the\ncalculation of quantum effects like the zero-point energy of very massive\nparticles in the vacuum. We find that brane-localized loops do not affect the\n4D curvature at all, but bulk loops can. These can be estimated on general\ngrounds and we show that supersymmetry dictates that they generate curvatures\nthat are generically of order m_KK^4/M_p^2.

We\npresent analytical arguments -- building on existing results for Gaussian\ninitial conditions -- which suggest that the effect of the filter at large\nsmoothing scales is remarkably simple, and is in fact identical to what happens\nin the Gaussian case: the non-Gaussian walks behave as if they were smooth and\ndeterministic, or \"completely correlated\". As a result, the first crossing\ndistribution (which determines, e.g., halo abundances) follows from the\nsingle-scale statistics of the non-Gaussian density field -- the so-called\n\"cloud-in-cloud\" problem does not exist for completely correlated walks. Also,\nthe answer from single-scale statistics is simply one half that for sharp-k\nwalks.

For 1:10 mergers we\nfind no increased final thin disc scale height compared to the isolated\nsimulation, leading to the conclusion that thin discs can be present even after\na 1:10 merger if a reasonable amount of hot gas is present. The reason for this\nis the accretion of new cold gas, leading to the formation of a massive new\nthin stellar disc that dominates the surface brightness profile. In a previous\nstudy, in which we included only cold gas in the disk, we showed that the\npresence of cold gas decreased the thickening by a minor merger relative to the\nno-gas case.

This is generally taken as evidence of highly decoupled\nevolutionary histories between GC systems and their parent galaxies. Here we\nshow, however, that new developments in linking the observed GC colors to their\nintrinsic metallicities suggest nonlinear color-to-metallicity conversions,\nwhich translate observed color distributions into strongly-peaked, unimodal\nMDFs with broad metal-poor tails. Remarkably, the inferred GC MDFs are similar\nto the MDFs of resolved field stars in nearby elliptical galaxies and those\nproduced by chemical evolution models of galaxies. The GC MDF shape,\ncharacterized by a sharp peak with a metal-poor tail, indicates a virtually\ncontinuous chemical enrichment with a relatively short timescale. The\ncharacteristic shape emerges across three orders of magnitude in the host\ngalaxy mass, suggesting a universal process of chemical enrichment among\nvarious GC systems. Given that GCs are bluer than field stars within the same\ngalaxy, it is plausible that the chemical enrichment processes of GCs ceased\nsomewhat earlier than that of field stellar population, and if so, GCs\npreferentially trace the major, vigorous mode of star formation events in\ngalactic formation. We further suggest a possible systematic age difference\namong GC systems, in that the GC systems in more luminous galaxies are older.\nThis is consistent with the downsizing paradigm of galaxies and supports\nadditionally the similar nature shared by GCs and field stars.

To this aim, we integrate\nin time the equations of mass and energy conservation under self-regulated\ninstability of a two-component disc of gas and stars. The disc is assumed to be\ncontinuously fed by cold gas at the average cosmological rate. The gas forms\nstars and is partly driven away by stellar feedback. The gas and stars flow\ninward through the disc to a central bulge due to torques that drive angular\nmomentum outwards. The gravitational energy released by the mass inflow down\nthe gravitational potential gradient drives the disc turbulence that maintains\nthe disc unstable with a Toomre instability parameter Q~1, compensating for the\ndissipative losses of the gas turbulence and raising the stellar velocity\ndispersion. We follow the velocity dispersion of stars and gas as they heat and\ncool respectively and search for disc `stabilization', to be marked by a low\ngas velocity dispersion comparable to the speed of sound ~10 km/s. We vary the\nmodel parameters that characterize the accreted gas fraction, turbulence\ndissipation rate, star-formation rate, and stellar feedback. We find that as\nlong as the gas input roughly follows the average cosmological rate, the disc\ninstability is a robust phenomenon at high redshift till z~1, driven by the\nhigh surface density and high gas fraction due to the intense cosmological\naccretion. For a broad range of model parameter values, the discs tend to\n`stabilize' at z~0-0.5 as they become dominated by hot stars. When the model\nparameters are pushed to extreme values, the discs may stabilize as early as\nz~2, with the gas loss by strong outflows serving as the dominant stabilizing\nfactor. \n\n"}

It is now known that at least some NSCs coexist\nwith supermassive black holes (SBHs); this is the case, for instance, in the\nMilky Way (MW). In this paper, we investigate how the presence of a SMBH at the\ncenter of the MW impacts the merger hypothesis for the formation of its NSC.\nStarting from a model consisting of a low-density nuclear stellar disk and the\nSMBH, we use N-body simulations to follow the successive inspiral and merger of\nglobular clusters. The clusters are started on circular orbits of radius 20 pc,\nand their initial masses and radii are set up in such a way as to be consistent\nwith the galactic tidal field at that radius. The total accumulated mass by ~10\nclusters is about 1.5x10^7 Solar masses. Each cluster is disrupted by the SMBH\nat a distance of roughly one parsec. The density profile that results after the\nfinal inspiral event is characterized by a core of roughly this radius, and an\nenvelope with density that falls off as 1/r^2. These properties are similar to\nthose of the MW NSC, with the exception of the core size, which in the MW is a\nlittle smaller. But by continuing the evolution of the model after the final\ninspiral event, we find that the core shrinks substantially via gravitational\nencounters in a time (when scaled to the MW) of 10 Gyr as the stellar\ndistribution evolves toward a Bahcall-Wolf cusp. We also show that the\nluminosity function of the MW NSC is consistent with the hypothesis that a\nlarge fraction of the mass comes from (~10Gyr) old stars, brought in by\nglobular clusters. We conclude that a model in which a large fraction of the\nmass of the MW NSC arose from infalling globular clusters is consistent with\nexisting observational constraints. \n\n"}

In\nthis paper we prove that the zeta correlation function is time-independent at\none-loop level in single clock inflation. While many of the one-loop diagrams\nlead to a time-dependence when considered individually, the time-dependence\nbeautifully cancels out in the overall sum. We identify two subsets of diagrams\nthat cancel separately due to different physical reasons. The first\ncancellation is related to the change of the background cosmology due to the\nrenormalization of the stress tensor. It results in a cancellation between the\nnon-1PI diagrams and some of the diagrams made with quartic vertices. The\nsecond subset of diagrams that cancel is made up of cubic operators, plus the\nremaining quartic ones. We are able to write the sum of these diagrams as the\nintegral over a specific three-point function between two very short\nwavelengths and one very long one. We then apply the consistency condition for\nthis three-point function in the squeezed limit to show that the sum of these\ndiagrams cannot give rise to a time dependence.

We show that cooling of high-velocity,\nshocked winds in AGN is in fact inefficient in a wide range of circumstances,\nincluding conditions relevant to ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs),\nresulting in energy-conserving outflows. We further show that fast\nenergy-conserving outflows can tolerate a large amount of mixing with cooler\ngas before radiative losses become important. For winds with initial velocity\nv_in>~10,000 km s^-1, as observed in ultra-violet and X-ray absorption, the\nshocked wind develops a two-temperature structure. While most of the thermal\npressure support is provided by the protons, the cooling processes operate\ndirectly only on the electrons. This significantly slows down inverse Compton\ncooling, while free free cooling is negligible. Slower winds with v_in~1,000 km\ns^-1, such as may be driven by radiation pressure on dust, can also experience\nenergy-conserving phases but under more restrictive conditions.

We find that the energy supply due to nuclear burning of\ninfalling material behind the shock can energize the shock expansion especially\nfor models that produce only marginal explosions in the absence of nuclear\nburning. These models are energized by nuclear energy deposition when the shock\nfront passes through the silicon-rich layer and/or later it touches the\noxygen-rich layer. Depending on the neutrino luminosity and its decay time, a\ndiagnostic energy of explosion increases up to a few times 10^50 erg for models\nwith nuclear burning compared to the corresponding models without. We point out\nthat these features are most remarkable for the Limongi-Chieffi progenitor in\nboth 1D and 2D, because the progenitor model possesses a massive oxygen layer\nwith its inner-edge radius being smallest among the employed progenitors, so\nthat the shock can touch the rich fuel on a shorter timescale after bounce. The\nenergy difference is generally smaller (~0.1-0.2 times 10^51 erg) in 2D than in\n1D (at most ~0.6 times 10^51 erg). This is because neutrino-driven convection\nand the shock instability in 2D models enhance the neutrino heating efficiency,\nwhich makes the contribution of nuclear burning relatively smaller compared to\n1D models. Considering uncertainties in progenitor models, our results indicate\nthat nuclear burning should remain as one of the important ingredients to\nfoster the onset of neutrino-driven explosions. \n\n"}

The latter is treated within the formalism of synchrotron radiation\nby replacing the particle Larmor radius with the curvature radius of the field\nlines. However, even at small pitch angles, the curvatures of the particle\ntrajectory and the field line may differ significantly.

Yet, it\nremains one of the hardest processes to understand when trying to connect\nobservations of stellar and galaxy populations to models of large scale\nstructure formation. The star formation rate at redshifts z > 2 drops off\nrather more quickly than was thought even five years ago. Theoretical models\nhave tended to overpredict the star formation rate at these high redshifts\nsubstantially, primarily due to overcooling. Overcooling in galaxies typically\noccurs because of unphysical radiative cooling. As a result, insufficient\nturbulence is driven by stellar feedback. I show that such turbulence has the\nnet effect of strongly inhibiting star formation, despite its ability to\nlocally promote star formation by compression. Radiation pressure appears less\nlikely to be a dominant driver of the turbulence than has been argued, but\nsupernova and magnetorotational instabilities remain viable. Gravity alone\ncannot be the main driver, as otherwise well-resolved models without feedback\nwould accurately predict star formation rates.

Correlation does not, however,\nimply causation. It appears that both molecule formation and star formation\noccur as a consequence of gravitational collapse, with molecules not essential\nin cooling. The basic concept that gravitational instability drives star\nformation remains a true guide through the thickets of complexity surrounding\nthis topic.

This work complements that of Paper I,\nwhere we studied the effects of varying models for galactic winds driven by\nstar formation and AGN. The normalisation of the matter power spectrum strongly\naffects the galaxy mass function, but has a relatively small effect on the\nphysical properties of galaxies residing in haloes of a fixed mass.\nReionization suppresses the stellar masses and gas fractions of low-mass\ngalaxies, but by z = 2 the results are insensitive to the timing of\nreionization.

The\nthird one proposes a dynamics of variable mass system for the halo in an\nexpanding universe, and the fourth one proposes the replacement of physical\nradius with comoving one over the halo, in an expanding universe. \n\n"}

We first present the\nmid-infrared (MIR) properties of the H-alpha-selected galaxies in a rich\ncluster Cl0939+4713 at z=0.4. With a MIR stacking analysis, we find that the\nmedian SFR of H-alpha emitters is higher in higher-density environment at\nz=0.4. We also find that star-forming galaxies in high-density environment tend\nto have higher specific SFR (SSFR), although the trend is much less significant\ncompared to that of SFR. This increase of SSFR in high-density environment is\nnot visible when we consider the SFR derived from H-alpha alone, suggesting\nthat the dust attenuation in galaxies depends on environment; galaxies in\nhigh-density environment tend to be dustier (by up to ~0.5 mag). We then\ndiscuss the environmental dependence of the SFR-M* relation for star-forming\ngalaxies since z~2, by compiling our comparable, narrow-band selected, large\nH-alpha emitter samples in both distant cluster environments (from\nMAHALO-Subaru) and field environments (from HiZELS). We find that the SSFR of\nH-alpha-selected galaxies (at the fixed mass of log(M*/Msun)=10) rapidly\nevolves as (1+z)^3, but the SFR-M* relation is independent of the environment\nsince z~2, as far as we rely on the H-alpha-based SFRs (with M*-dependent\nextinction correction).

Abstract: The intrinsic X-ray emission of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) is often found to be\nabsorbed over and above the column density through our own galaxy. The extra\ncomponent is usually assumed to be due to absorbing gas lying within the host\ngalaxy of the GRB itself. There is an apparent correlation between the\nequivalent column density of hydrogen, N(H,intrinsic) (assuming it to be at the\nGRB redshift), and redshift, z, with the few z>6 GRBs showing the greatest\nintrinsic column densities. We investigate the N(H,intrinsic) - z relation\nusing a large sample of Swift GRBs, as well as active galactic nuclei (AGN) and\nquasar samples, paying particular attention to the spectral energy\ndistributions of the two highest redshift GRBs. Various possible sample biases\nand systematics that might produce such a correlation are considered, and we\nconclude that the correlation is very likely to be real. This may indicate\neither an evolutionary effect in the host galaxy properties, or a contribution\nfrom gas along the line-of-sight, in the diffuse intergalactic medium (IGM) or\nintervening absorbing clouds. Employing a more realistic model for IGM\nabsorption than in previous works, we find that this may explain much of the\nobserved opacity at z>~3 providing it is not too hot, likely between 10^5 K and\n10^6.5 K, and moderately metal enriched, Z~0.2 Z_sun. This material could\ntherefore constitute the Warm Hot Intergalactic Medium. However, a comparable\nlevel of absorption is also expected from the cumulative effect of intervening\ncold gas clouds, and given current uncertainties it is not possible to say\nwhich, if either, dominates. At lower redshifts, we conclude that gas in the\nhost galaxies must be the dominant contributor to the observed X-ray\nabsorption. \n\n"}

In this paper, we quantify which physical mechanisms could\nbe responsible. On scales larger than the disc scale height, the low SFR is\nfound to be consistent with episodic star formation due to secular\ninstabilities or possibly variations of the gas inflow along the Galactic bar.\nThe CMZ is marginally Toomre-stable when including gas and stars, but highly\nToomre-stable when only accounting for the gas, indicating a low condensation\nrate of self-gravitating clouds. On small scales, we find that the SFR in the\nCMZ may be caused by an elevated critical density for star formation due to the\nhigh turbulent pressure. The existence of a universal density threshold for\nstar formation is ruled out. The HI-H$_2$ phase transition of hydrogen, the\ntidal field, a possible underproduction of massive stars due to a bottom-heavy\ninitial mass function, magnetic fields, and cosmic ray or radiation pressure\nfeedback also cannot individually explain the low SFR.

In\nboth cases the measured lag (t_cen) of Fe II is longer than that of H-beta,\nalthough the inferred lags are somewhat sensitive to the choice of Fe II\ntemplate used in the fit. For spectral decompositions done using the Fe II\ntemplate of Veron-Cetty et al. (2004), we find t_cen(Fe II)/t_cen(H-beta) =\n1.9+-0.6 in NGC 4593 and 1.5+-0.3 in Mrk 1511. The detection of highly\ncorrelated variations between Fe II and continuum emission demonstrates that\nthe Fe II emission in these galaxies originates in photoionized gas, located\npredominantly in the outer portion of the broad-line region. \n\n"}

Instead,\nthe evidence points to low [alpha/Fe] ratios resulting from an initial mass\nfunction (IMF) deficient in the highest mass stars. The critical evidence is\nthe 0.4 dex deficiency of [O/Fe], [Mg/Fe] and other hydrostatic elements,\ncontrasting with the normal trend of r-process [Eu/Fe]r with [Fe/H]. Supporting\nevidence comes from the hydrostatic element (O, Mg, Na, Al, Cu) [X/Fe] ratios,\nwhich are inconsistent with iron added to the Milky Way (MW) disk trends. Also,\nthe ratio of hydrostatic to explosive (Si, Ca, Ti) element abundances suggests\na relatively top-light IMF. Abundance similarities with the LMC, Fornax and IC\n1613, suggest that their alpha-element deficiencies also resulted from IMFs\nlacking the most massive SNII.\n  For such a top-light IMF, the normal trend of r-process [Eu/Fe]r with [Fe/H],\nas seen in Sgr, indicates that massive Type II supernovae (>30Msun) cannot be\nmajor sources of r-process elements.\n  High [La/Y] ratios, consistent with leaky-box chemical evolution, are\nconfirmed but ~0.3 dex larger than theoretical AGB predictions. This may be due\nto the 13C pocket mass, or a difference between MW and Sgr AGB stars. Sgr has\nthe lowest [Rb/Zr] ratios known, consistent with low-mass (~2Msun) AGB stars\nnear [Fe/H]=-0.6, likely resulting from leaky-box chemical evolution.\n  The [Cu/O] trend in Sgr and the MW suggest that Cu yields increase with both\nmetallicity and stellar mass, as expected from Cu production by the weak\ns-process in massive stars.\n  Finally, we present an updated hfs line list, an abundance analysis of\nArcturus, and further develop our error analysis formalism. \n\n"}

We propose that the magnetic field was amplified to this values\nalready during the formation and the early evolution of the galaxies.\nTurbulence in young galaxies is driven by accretion as well as by supernova\n(SN) explosions of the first generation of stars. The small-scale dynamo can\nconvert the turbulent kinetic energy into magnetic energy and amplify very weak\nprimordial magnetic seed fields on short timescales. The amplification takes\nplace in two phases: in the kinematic phase the magnetic field grows\nexponentially, with the largest growth on the smallest non-resistive scale. In\nthe following non-linear phase the magnetic energy is shifted towards larger\nscales until the dynamo saturates on the turbulent forcing scale. To describe\nthe amplification of the magnetic field quantitatively we model the\nmicrophysics in the interstellar medium (ISM) of young galaxies and determine\nthe growth rate of the small-scale dynamo. We estimate the resulting saturation\nfield strengths and dynamo timescales for two turbulent forcing mechanisms:\naccretion-driven turbulence and SN-driven turbulence.

Abstract: Galaxy clustering sets strong constraints on the physics governing galaxy\nformation and evolution. However, most current models fail to reproduce the\nclustering of low-mass galaxies on small scales ($r<1Mpc/h$). In this paper we\nstudy the galaxy clusterings predicted from a few semi-analytical models. We\nfirstly compare two Munich versions, Guo et al. (2011, Guo11) and De Lucia \\&\nBlazoit (2007, DLB07). The Guo11 model well reproduces the galaxy stellar mass\nfunction, but over-predicts the clustering of low-mass galaxies on small\nscales. The DLB07 model provides a better fit to the clustering on small\nscales, but over-predicts the stellar mass function. These seem to be puzzling.\nWe find that there is slightly more fraction of satellite galaxies residing in\nmassive haloes in the Guo11 model, which is the dominant contribution to the\nclustering discrepancy between the two models. However, both models still\nover-predict the clustering at $0.1Mpc/h<r<10Mpc/h$ for low mass galaxies. This\nis because both models over-predict the number of satellites by $30\\%$ in\nmassive halos than the data. Actually, the better agreement of DLB07 model with\nthe data on small scales comes as a coincidence as it predicts too many\nlow-mass central galaxies which are less clustered and thus bring down the\ntotal clustering. Finally, we show the predictions from the semi-analytical of\nKang et al. (2012). We find that this model can simultaneously fit the stellar\nmass function and galaxy clustering if the supernova feedback in satellite\ngalaxies is stronger. We conclude that semi-analytical models are now able to\nsolve the small-scales clustering problem, without invoking of any other new\nphysics or changing the dark matter properties, such as the recent favored warm\ndark matter. \n\n"}

This work addresses the AGN IR-selection dependency on intrinsic source\nluminosity and obscuration, in order to identify and charaterise biases which\ncould affect conclusions in studies. METHODS. We study IR-selected AGN in the\nChandra Deep Field South (CDFS) survey and in the Cosmological Survey (COSMOS).\nThe AGN sample is divided into low and high X-ray luminosity classes, and into\nunobscured (type-1) and obscured (type-2) classes by means of X-ray and optical\nspectroscopy data. Specifically in the X-rays regime, we adopt the intrinsic\nluminosity taking into account the estimated column density (N_H). We also take\nthe chance to highlight important differences resulting from adopting different\nmethods to assess AGN obscuration. RESULTS. In agreement with previous studies,\nwe also find that AGN IR-selection efficiency shows a decrease with decreasing\nsource AGN X-ray luminosity. For the intermediate-luminosity AGN population\n(43.3<~log(L_X[erg/s])<~44$), the efficiency also worsens with increasing\nobscuration. The same sample also shows an evolution with cosmic time of the\nobscured fraction at the highest X-ray luminosities, independently of adopted\ntype-1/type-2 classification method. CONCLUSIONS. We confirm that AGN\nIR-selection is genuinely biased toward unobscured AGN, but only at\nintermediate luminosities. At the highest luminosities, where AGN IR-selection\nis more efficient, there is no obscuration bias. We show that type-1 AGN are\nintrinsically more luminous than type-2 AGN only at z<~1.6, thus resulting in\nmore type-1 AGN being selected the shallower the IR survey is.

It has a photometrically\ndetermined redshift $z=1.91^{+0.19}_{-0.21}$, making it among the most distant\nclusters known, and nominally the most distant for which the SZ effect has been\nmeasured. The spherically integrated Comptonization is\n$Y_{500}=(3.0\\pm0.4)\\times 10^{-12}$, a measurement which is relatively\ninsensitive to assumptions regarding the size and redshift of the cluster, as\nwell as the background cosmology.

Abstract: It is commonly thought that AGN feedback can break the self-similar scaling\nrelations of galaxies, groups, and clusters. Using high-resolution 3D\nhydrodynamic simulations, we isolate the impact of AGN feedback on the $L_{\\rm\nx}-T_{\\rm x} $ relation, testing the two archetypal and common regimes,\nself-regulated mechanical feedback and a quasar thermal blast. We find that AGN\nfeedback has severe difficulty in breaking the relation in a consistent way.\nThe similarity breaking is directly linked to the gas evacuation within\n$R_{500}$, while the central cooling times are inversely proportional to the\ncore density. Breaking self-similarity implies thus breaking the cool core,\nmorphing all systems to non-cool-core objects, which is in clear contradiction\nwith the observed data populated by several cool-core systems. Self-regulated\nfeedback, which quenches cooling flows and preserves cool cores, prevents the\ndramatic evacuation and similarity breaking at any scale; the relation scatter\nis also limited. The impulsive thermal blast can break the core-included\n$L_{\\rm x}-T_{\\rm x}$ at $T_{500} < 1$ keV, but substantially empties and\noverheats the halo, generating a perennial non-cool-core group, as experienced\nby cosmological simulations. Even with partial evacuation, massive systems\nremain overheated. We show the action of purely AGN feedback is to lower the\nluminosity and heating the gas, perpendicular to the fit. \n\n"}

The Higgs mass exhausts one out of three\ninput parameters of the minimal, five-dimensional version of universal extra\ndimension models, the other two parameters being the Kaluza-Klein (KK) scale\nand the cut-off scale of the theory.

By\nfitting the SEDs, we have obtained stellar masses, dust masses, star-formation\nrate (SFR), and extinctions for our sample galaxies. We find that GRBHs are\ngalaxies that tend to have a high specfic SFR (sSFR), and like other\nstar-forming galaxies, their ratios of dust-to-stellar mass are well correlated\nwith sSFR.

At the same\ntime, the current best-fit value of $r$ suggests large field inflation delta\nphi>M_p, which requires a UV complete description of inflation. A very\npromising working example that predicts large tensor modes and can be UV\ncompleted is axion monodromy inflation. This realization of inflation naturally\nproduces oscillating features, as consequence of a broken shift symmetry.

A dependence\nof the halo mass function on large-scale mean density is a standard element of\ncosmological theory, allowing mass-dependent biasing to be understood via the\npeak-background split. On the assumption of a Gaussian density field, this\nanalysis can be extended to ask how the mass function depends on the\ngeometrical environment: clusters, filaments, sheets and voids, as classified\nvia the tidal tensor (the Hessian matrix of the gravitational potential). In\nlinear theory, the problem can be solved exactly, and the result is\nattractively simple: the conditional mass function has no explicit dependence\non the local tidal field, and is a function only of the local density on the\nfiltering scale used to define the tidal tensor. There is nevertheless a strong\nimplicit predicted dependence on geometrical environment, because the local\ndensity couples statistically to the derivatives of the potential. We compute\nthe predictions of this model and study the limits of their validity by\ncomparing them to results deduced empirically from $N$-body simulations. We\nhave verified that, to a good approximation, the abundance of haloes in\ndifferent environments depends only on their densities, and not on their tidal\nstructure. In this sense we find relative differences between halo abundances\nin different environments with the same density which are smaller than 13%.\nFurthermore, for sufficiently large filtering scales, the agreement with the\ntheoretical prediction is good, although there are important deviations from\nthe Gaussian prediction at small, non-linear scales.

Using different variants of the\ntest-field method, we determine the quenching of the turbulent transport\ncoefficients for the forced Roberts flow, isotropically forced non-helical\nturbulence, and rotating thermal convection. We see significant quenching only\nwhen the mean magnetic field is larger than the equipartition value of the\nturbulence.

However, when the magnetic field is\nexpressed in terms of the equipartition value of the unquenched flows these\nquenching exponents become about 4, 1.5, and 2.3, respectively. For the\n$\\alpha$ effect, the exponent is about 1.3 for the Roberts flow and 2 for\nconvection in the first case, but 4 and 3, respectively, in the second.

For a given galaxy separation $\\vec{r}$, such\nfunction can be described as a superposition of virtually infinite local\ndistributions. We characterize these in terms of their moments and then\nconsider the specific case in which they are Gaussian functions, each with its\nown mean $\\mu$ and dispersion $\\sigma$.

We show the evolution of the diagonal density-matrix elements\nquickly approaches the Fokker-Planck equation of Starobinsky's stochastic\ninflationary picture. This provides an alternative first-principles derivation\nof this picture's stochastic noise and drift, as well as its leading\ncorrections. (An application computes the noise for systems with a sub-luminal\nsound speed.) We argue that the presence of interactions drives the\noff-diagonal density-matrix elements to zero in the field basis. This shows why\nthe field basis is the `pointer basis' for the decoherence of primordial\nquantum fluctuations while they are outside the horizon, thus allowing them to\nre-enter as classical fluctuations, as assumed when analyzing CMB data. The\ndecoherence process is efficient, occurring after several Hubble times even for\ninteractions as weak as gravitational-strength. Crucially, the details of the\ninteractions largely control only the decoherence time and not the nature of\nthe final late-time stochastic state, much as interactions can control the\nequilibration time for thermal systems but are largely irrelevant to the\nproperties of the resulting equilibrium state. \n\n"}

Aims. We determine the\nSMF of the z=0.44 cluster of galaxies MACS J1206.2-0847 separately for passive\nand star-forming (SF) galaxies, in different regions of the cluster, from the\ncenter out to approximately 2 virial radii.

Stellar masses are obtained by SED fitting\non 5-band photometric data obtained at the Subaru telescope. We identify 1363\ncluster members down to a stellar mass of 10^9.5 Msolar. Results. The whole\ncluster SMF is well fitted by a double Schechter function. The SMFs of cluster\nSF and passive galaxies are statistically different. The SMF of the SF cluster\ngalaxies does not depend on the environment. The SMF of the passive population\nhas a significantly smaller slope (in absolute value) in the innermost (<0.50\nMpc), highest density cluster region, than in more external, lower density\nregions. The number ratio of giant/subgiant galaxies is maximum in this\ninnermost region and minimum in the adjacent region, but then gently increases\nagain toward the cluster outskirts. This is also reflected in a decreasing\nradial trend of the average stellar mass per cluster galaxy. On the other hand,\nthe stellar mass fraction, i.e., the ratio of stellar to total cluster mass,\ndoes not show any significant radial trend. Conclusions. Our results appear\nconsistent with a scenario in which SF galaxies evolve into passive galaxies\ndue to density-dependent environmental processes, and eventually get destroyed\nvery near the cluster center to become part of a diffuse intracluster medium. \n\n"}

We demonstrate the performance of our approach, using a Fisher\nanalysis on cosmic shear tomography described in terms of E-/B-mode separating\nstatistics (COSEBIs). We show that our data compression is highly effective in\nextracting essentially the full cosmological information from a strongly\nreduced number of observables. Specifically, the number of statistics needed\ndecreases by at least one order of magnitude relative to the COSEBIs, which\nalready compress the data substantially compared to the shear two-point\ncorrelation functions. The efficiency appears to be affected only slightly if a\nhighly inaccurate covariance is used for defining the compressed statistics,\nshowing the robustness of the method.

Gravitational perturbations from\nthe BH companion, on a much wider orbit, can cause the dark matter particle to\nreach extremely high eccentricities and even get accreted onto the BH, by what\nis known as the Eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) mechanism. We show that this may\nproduce a torus-like configuration for the dark matter distribution around the\nless massive member of the BH binary. We first consider an Intermediate BH\n(IMBH) in the vicinity of our Galactic Center, which may be a relic of a past\nminor merger.

It is shown that if only short pieces of the undesirable\nfield lines are expelled, then mass can flow down along these field lines\nwithout requiring much energy.

We\nelaborate on a possible link between this phenomenon and the low--$\\ell$ CMB.\nFor the first 32 multipoles, combining the hard exponential with a milder one\nleading to $n_s\\simeq 0.96$ and with a small gaussian bump we have attained a\nreduction of $\\chi^{\\,2}$ to about 46% of the standard $\\Lambda$CDM setting,\nwith both WMAP9 and PLANCK 2013 data. This result corresponds to a\n$\\chi^{\\,2}/DOF$ of about 0.45, to be compared with a $\\Lambda$CDM value of\nabout 0.85. The preferred choices combine naturally quadrupole depression, a\nfirst peak around $\\ell=5$ and a wide minimum around $\\ell=20$. We have also\ngathered some evidence that similar spectra emerge if the hard exponential is\ncombined with more realistic models of inflation. A problem of the preferred\nexamples is their slow convergence to an almost scale--invariant profile. \n\n"}

We find that pairs of\nhost halos \"know about\" each others' assembly histories even when their\npresent-day separation is greater than thirty times the virial radius of either\nhalo.

Some circumstellar-interacting (CSI) supernovae (SNe) are produced\nby the explosions of massive stars that have lost mass shortly before the SN\nexplosion. There is evidence that the precursors of some SNe IIn were luminous\nblue variable (LBV) stars. For a small number of CSI SNe, outbursts have been\nobserved before the SN explosion. Eruptive events of massive stars are named as\nSN impostors (SN IMs) and whether they herald a forthcoming SN or not is still\nunclear. The large variety of observational properties of CSI SNe suggests the\nexistence of other progenitors, such as red supergiant (RSG) stars with\nsuperwinds. Furthermore, the role of metallicity in the mass loss of CSI SN\nprogenitors is still largely unexplored. Aims. Our goal is to gain insight on\nthe nature of the progenitor stars of CSI SNe by studying their environments,\nin particular the metallicity at their locations. Methods. We obtain\nmetallicity measurements at the location of 60 transients (including SNe IIn,\nSNe Ibn, and SN IMs), via emission-line diagnostic on optical spectra obtained\nat the Nordic Optical Telescope and through public archives. Metallicity values\nfrom the literature complement our sample. We compare the metallicity\ndistributions among the different CSI SN subtypes and to those of other\ncore-collapse SN types. We also search for possible correlations between\nmetallicity and CSI SN observational properties. Results. We find that SN IMs\ntend to occur in environments with lower metallicity than those of SNe IIn.\nAmong SNe IIn, SN IIn-L(1998S-like) SNe show higher metallicities, similar to\nthose of SNe IIL/P, whereas long-lasting SNe IIn (1988Z-like) show lower\nmetallicities, similar to those of SN IMs. The metallicity distribution of SNe\nIIn can be reproduced by combining the metallicity distributions of SN IMs\n(that may be produced by major outbursts of massive stars like LBVs) and SNe\nIIP (produced by RSGs). The same applies to the distributions of the Normalized\nCumulative Rank (NCR) values, which quantifies the SN association to H II\nregions. For SNe IIn, we find larger mass-loss rates and higher CSM velocities\nat higher metallicities. The luminosity increment in the optical bands during\nSN IM outbursts tend to be larger at higher metallicity, whereas the SN IM\nquiescent optical luminosities tend to be lower. Conclusions. The difference in\nmetallicity between SNe IIn and SN IMs suggests that LBVs are only one of the\nprogenitor channels for SNe IIn, with 1988Z-like and 1998S-like SNe possibly\narising from LBVs and RSGs, respectively. Finally, even though linedriven winds\nlikely do not primarily drive the late mass-loss of CSI SN progenitors,\nmetallicity has some impact on the observational properties of these\ntransients.

This missing\ngalactic feedback problem is extremely prominent in early-type galaxy bulges\nwhere there is little cool gas to make the SNe ejecta radiate at lower\ntemperature beyond the X-ray domain.

This\nabundance ratio is much higher than those of spiral galaxies, and even among\nthe highest ones of S0 and elliptical galaxies. NGC5866 also simultaneously has\nthe highest Fe/O abundance ratio and molecular gas mass among a small sample of\ngas-poor early-type galaxies.

Abstract: The classic question that how young massive star clusters attain their shapes\nand sizes, as we find them today, remains to be a challenge. Both observational\nand computational studies of star-forming massive molecular gas clouds infer\nthat massive cluster formation is primarily triggered along the small-scale\n($\\lesssim0.3$ pc) filamentary substructures within the clouds. The present\nstudy is intended to investigate the possible ways in which a\nfilament-like-compact, massive star cluster (effective radius 0.1-0.3 pc) can\nexpand $\\gtrsim10$ times, still remaining massive enough ($\\gtrsim10^4\nM_\\odot$), to become a young massive star cluster, as we observe today. To that\nend, model massive clusters (of initially $10^4 M_\\odot-10^5 M_\\odot$) are\nevolved using Sverre Aarseth's state-of-the-art N-body code NBODY7. All the\ncomputed clusters expand with time, whose sizes (effective radii) are compared\nwith those observed for young massive clusters, of age $\\lesssim100$ Myr, in\nthe Milky Way and other nearby galaxies. It is found that beginning from the\nabove compact sizes, a star cluster cannot expand by its own, i.e., due to\ntwo-body relaxation, stellar-evolutionary mass loss, dynamical heating by\nprimordial binaries and stellar-mass black holes, up to the observed sizes of\nyoung massive clusters; they always remain much more compact compared to the\nobserved ones. This calls for additional mechanisms that can boost the\nexpansion of a massive cluster after its assembly.

Pure thermal feedback alone is sufficient to produce the observed\nsurface brightness, although it is very sensitive to the supernova rate.

We make use of the\nsample of the 100 brightest galaxy clusters discovered in the XXL Survey to\ninvestigate the fraction of baryons in the form of hot gas and stars in the\ncluster population. We measure the gas masses of the detected halos and use a\nmass--temperature relation directly calibrated using weak-lensing measurements\nfor a subset of XXL clusters to estimate the halo mass. We find that the\nweak-lensing calibrated gas fraction of XXL-100-GC clusters is substantially\nlower than was found in previous studies using hydrostatic masses.

Cosmic voids\nare usually identified in spectroscopic galaxy surveys, where 3D information\nabout the large-scale structure of the Universe is available. Although an\nincreasing amount of photometric data is being produced, its potential for void\nstudies is limited since photometric redshifts induce line-of-sight position\nerrors of $\\sim50$ Mpc/$h$ or more that can render many voids undetectable. In\nthis paper we present a new void finder designed for photometric surveys,\nvalidate it using simulations, and apply it to the high-quality photo-$z$\nredMaGiC galaxy sample of the Dark Energy Survey Science Verification (DES-SV)\ndata. The algorithm works by projecting galaxies into 2D slices and finding\nvoids in the smoothed 2D galaxy density field of the slice. Fixing the\nline-of-sight size of the slices to be at least twice the photo-$z$ scatter,\nthe number of voids found in these projected slices of simulated spectroscopic\nand photometric galaxy catalogs is within 20% for all transverse void sizes,\nand indistinguishable for the largest voids of radius $\\sim 70$ Mpc/$h$ and\nlarger. The positions, radii, and projected galaxy profiles of photometric\nvoids also accurately match the spectroscopic void sample. Applying the\nalgorithm to the DES-SV data in the redshift range $0.2<z<0.8$, we identify 87\nvoids with comoving radii spanning the range 18-120 Mpc/$h$, and carry out a\nstacked weak lensing measurement. With a significance of $4.4\\sigma$, the\nlensing measurement confirms the voids are truly underdense in the matter field\nand hence not a product of Poisson noise, tracer density effects or systematics\nin the data. It also demonstrates, for the first time in real data, the\nviability of void lensing studies in photometric surveys. \n\n"}

Abstract: Simulations of cosmological filamentary accretion reveal flows (\"streams\") of\nwarm gas, ~$10^4$ K, which are efficient in bringing gas into galaxies. We\npresent a phenomenological scenario where gas in such flows -- if it is shocked\nas it enters the halo as we assume -- become biphasic and, as a result,\nturbulent. We consider a collimated stream of warm gas that flows into a halo\nfrom an over dense filament of the cosmic web. The post-shock streaming gas\nexpands because it has a higher pressure than the ambient halo gas, and\nfragments as it cools. The fragmented stream forms a two phase medium: a warm\ncloudy phase embedded in hot post-shock gas. We argue that the hot phase\nsustains the accretion shock. A fraction of the initial kinetic energy of the\ninfalling gas is converted into turbulence among and within the warm clouds.\nThe thermodynamic evolution of the post-shock gas is largely determined by the\nrelative timescales of several processes -- the cooling, the expansion of the\npost-shock gas, the amount of turbulence in the clouds, and the halo dynamics.\nWe expect the gas to become multiphase when the cooling and dynamical times are\nof the same order-of-magnitude. In this framework, we show that this occurs in\nthe important mass range of ~$10^{11}$ to $10^{13}$ M$_\\odot$ , where the bulk\nof stars have formed in galaxies. Gas accreting along cosmic web filaments may\neventually lose coherence and mix with the ambient halo gas. Through both the\nphase separation and \"disruption\" of the stream, the accretion efficiency onto\na galaxy in a halo dynamical time is lowered. De-collimating flows make the\ndirect interaction between galaxy feedback and accretion streams more likely,\nthereby further reducing the overall accretion efficiency.

In a\ncompanion paper, we found steady-state solutions of the hydrodynamic equations\nthat are coupled to the CR energy equation for a large cluster sample. In those\nsolutions, radiative cooling in the central region is balanced by streaming CRs\nthrough the generation and dissipation of resonantly generated Alfv{\\'e}n waves\nand by thermal conduction at large radii.

We construct the Floquet charts to find regions of parameter\nspace in which particle production is efficient for both the adiabatic and\nisocurvature modes, and analyze the resonance structure using analytic and\nsemi-analytic techniques. Particle production in the adiabatic direction is\ncharacterized by the existence of an asymptotic scaling solution at large\nvalues of the nonminimal couplings, $\\xi_I \\gg 1$, in which the dominant\ninstability band arises in the long-wavelength limit, for comoving wavenumbers\n$k \\rightarrow 0$. However, the large-$\\xi_I$ regime is not reached until\n$\\xi_I \\geq {\\cal O} (100)$.

Many\nclusters have been shown to host large-scale diffuse radio emission, known\nvariously as radio haloes and relics.

We produce\nlow-resolution maps of MACS J0025.4$-$1222 through a combination of uv-tapering\nand subtracting the compact source population.

We\nelucidate the screening mechanism by showing that in the quasi-static Newtonian\nlimit there are precise analogies between symmetron gravity and electrostatics\nfor both strong and weak screening.

This algorithm ensures manifest conservation of mass, energy,\nand momentum, and avoids imprinting 'preferred directions' on the ejecta. We\nshow that it is critical to incorporate both momentum and thermal energy of\nmechanical ejecta in a self-consistent manner, accounting for SNe cooling radii\nwhen they are not resolved. Using idealized simulations of single SN\nexplosions, we show that the FIRE-2 algorithm, independent of resolution,\nreproduces converged solutions in both energy and momentum. In contrast, common\n'fully-thermal' (energy-dump) or 'fully-kinetic' (particle-kicking) schemes in\nthe literature depend strongly on resolution: when applied at mass resolution\n>100 solar masses, they diverge by orders-of-magnitude from the converged\nsolution.

However, this\nmethod is limited by degeneracies between the density profile of dark matter\nand the stellar mass-to-light ratio. In this work we reduce this degeneracy by\ncombining weak lensing together with strong lensing and stellar kinematics. Our\nanalysis is based on two galaxy samples: 45 strong lenses from the SLACS survey\nand 1,700 massive quiescent galaxies from the SDSS main spectroscopic sample\nwith weak lensing measurements from the Hyper Suprime-Cam survey. We use a\nBayesian hierarchical approach to jointly model all three observables. We fit\nthe data with models of varying complexity and show that a model with a radial\ngradient in the stellar mass-to-light ratio is required to simultaneously\ndescribe both galaxy samples. This result is driven by a subset of strong\nlenses with very steep total density profile, that cannot be fitted by models\nwith no gradient. Our measurements are unable to determine whether $M_*/L$\ngradients are due to variations in stellar population parameters at fixed IMF,\nor to gradients in the IMF itself.

The\nmain effect of strong lensing selection is to shift the stellar mass\ndistribution towards the high mass end, while the halo mass and stellar IMF\ndistribution at fixed stellar mass are not significantly affected. \n\n"}

Here we find that\nthe first six binary black hole (BBH) merging events reported by LIGO/Virgo\nshow clear evidence for lensing in the plane of observed mass and source\ndistance. The four lowest frequency events follow an apparent locus in this\nplane, which we can reproduce by galaxy lensing, where the higher the\nmagnification, the generally more distant the source so the wave train is\nstretched more by the Universal expansion, by factors of 2-4. This revises the\nreported BBH distances upwards by an order of magnitude, equal to the square\nroot of the magnification. Furthermore, the reported black hole masses must be\ndecreased by 2-4 to counter the larger stretch factor, since the orbital\nfrequency is used to derive the black hole masses. This lowers the masses to\n5-15 solar masses, well below the puzzlingly high values of 20-35 solar masses\notherwise estimated, with the attraction of finding agreement in mass with\nblack holes orbiting stars in our own Galaxy, thereby implying a stellar origin\nfor the low frequency events in the far Universe.

The main\nfindings of our work highlight the relevance of the assumed phase-space\ndistribution: Referring to a generalized J-factor, namely the line-of-sight\nconvolution of the spatial part in case of velocity-dependent annihilation\nrate, an enhancement (suppression) with respect to the limit of isotropic\nphase-space distributions is obtained for the case of tangentially (radially)\nbiased DM particle orbits.

The outcome of our broad study stands out as a representative of the\nstate-of-the-art in the field, and falls within the interest of current and\nfuture experimental collaborations involved in DM indirect detection programs. \n\n"}

[1] we analyzed the behavior of these\nclumps, assuming spherical symmetry, allowing for both attractive and repulsive\nself-interactions. There is a maximum allowed mass for the clumps in the case\nof attractive interactions, and a minimum radius for the clumps in the case of\nrepulsive interactions, which is saturated at large mass. Here we extend this\nwork to include non-spherically symmetric clumps. Since the system tries to\nre-organize into a BEC ground state, we consider configurations with a\nconserved non-zero angular momentum, and construct minimum energy\nconfigurations at fixed particle number and fixed angular momentum.

In the recent past there\nhave been many attempts to solve the tension between direct measurements of\n$H_0$ and $\\sigma_8 \\sqrt{\\Omega_{0 {\\rm m}}}$ from the respective low redshift\nobservables and indirect measurements of these quantities from the cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB).

We test this parameterization against the latest\nPlanck CMB data combined with recent BAO, SNeIa datasets and the R16 direct\n$H_0$ measurements, and compare among different cosmological models. Our\nanalysis reveals that a strong positive correlation between $H_0$ and\n$\\sigma_8$ is more or less generic, irrespective of the choice of cosmological\nmodels. We also find that present data slightly prefers a phantom equation of\nstate for dark energy and a slight negative value for effective equation of\nstate for dark matter (which is a direct signature of interacting models) with\na relatively high value for $H_0$ consistent with R16 and simultaneously, a\nconsistent value for $\\Omega_{0 {\\rm m}}$. Thus, even though the tensions\ncannot be fully resolved, interacting models with phantom equation of state get\na slight edge over the others for currently available data.

Abstract: Only star clusters that are sufficiently compact and massive survive largely\nunharmed beyond 10 Myr. However, their compactness means a high stellar density\nwhich can lead to strong gravitational interactions between the stars. As young\nstars are often initially surrounded by protoplanetary disks and later on\npotentially by planetary systems, the question arises to what degree these\nstrong gravitational interactions influence planet formation and the properties\nof planetary systems. Here, we perform simulations of the evolution of compact\nhigh-mass clusters like Trumpler 14 and Westerlund 2 from the embedded to the\ngas-free phase and study the influence of stellar interactions. We concentrate\non the development of the mean disk size in these environments. Our simulations\nshow that in high-mass open clusters $80-90\\%$ of all disks/planetary systems\nshould be smaller than 50 AU just due to the strong stellar interactions in\nthese environments. Already in the initial phases, 3-4 close fly-bys lead to\ntypical disk sizes within the range of 18-27 AU. Afterwards, the disk sizes are\naltered only to a small extent. Our findings agree with the recent observation\nthat the disk sizes in the once dense environment of the Upper Scorpio OB\nassociation, NGC~2362, and h/$\\chi$Persei are at least three times smaller in\nsize than, for example, in Taurus.

The (filament-type) saddle points of this cosmic web provide a\nlocal frame in which to quantify the induced physical and morphological\nevolution of galaxies on large scales. The properties of virtual galaxies\nwithin the Horizon-AGN simulation are stacked in such a frame. The iso-contours\nof the galactic number density, mass, specific star formation rate (sSFR),\nkinematics and age are clearly aligned with the filament axis with steep\ngradients perpendicular to the filaments.

Tracing these\nformer nuclei of stripped galaxies provides a unique way to track the assembly\nhistory of a galaxy or galaxy cluster. In this paper we present a new method to\nestimate how many UCDs host an SMBH in their center and thus are stripped\ngalaxy nuclei.

We revise the\nstellar population mass estimates using a new empirical relation between the\nmass-to-light ratio (M/L) and metallicity, and use this to predict which UCDs\nare most likely to host an SMBH. This enables us to calculate the fraction of\nUCDs that host SMBHs across their entire luminosity range for the first time.\nWe then apply the SMBH occupation fraction to the observed luminosity function\nof UCDs and estimate that in the Fornax and Virgo cluster alone there should be\n$69^{+32}_{-25}$ stripped nuclei with SMBHs.

Whilst ULXs harboring black hole accretors (BH ULXs)\nare typically emitting isotropically, the majority of ULXs with neutron star\naccretors (NS ULXs) are found to be beamed.

Using 1 kpc-scale spaxels, we compute the relationships between\nthe star formation rate and stellar mass surface densities, i.e. the spatially\nresolved star-forming main sequence (rSFMS), and between the gas metallicity\nand the stellar mass surface density, i.e. the spatially resolved\nmass-metallicity relation (rMZR). We compare to observed relations derived from\nintegral field unit surveys and imaging of galaxies. EAGLE reproduces the slope\nof the local ($z\\approx0.1$) rSFMS well, but with a $\\approx-0.15$ dex offset,\nclose to that found for the galaxy-integrated relation. The shape of the rMZR\nagrees reasonably well with observations, replicating the characteristic\nturnover at high surface density, which we show is due to AGN feedback. The\nresiduals of the rSFMS and rMZR are negatively (positively) correlated at low\n(high) surface density.

In the model, clouds form from thermally unstable ambient gas and\nget destroyed by feedback from massive stars and thermal conduction. Feedback\nin the ambient phase cycles gas into a hot galactic fountain or wind. We model\nthe ambient gas hydrodynamically using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH).\nHowever, we cannot resolve the Jeans mass in the cold and dense molecular gas\nand, therefore, represent the cloud phase with ballistic particles that\ncoagulate when colliding. We show that this naturally produces a multiphase\nmedium with cold clouds, a warm disk, hot supernova bubbles and a hot, tenuous\nhalo.

This provides an attractive reformulation of the\ncosmological entropy problem, in which the large entropy is a consequence of\nthe topology, though we would argue that a final solution of the entropy\nproblem requires a dynamical explanation of the topology of spacetime.\nNevertheless, it is reassuring that this entropy can be achieved within the\nholographic limit if the ordinary FRW space is also a compact hyperbolic\nmanifold. In addition, the very large statistical averaging inherent in the\ncollapse of the initial entropy onto the brane acts to smooth out initial\ninhomogeneities. This smoothing is then sufficient to account for the current\nhomogeneity of the universe. With only mild fine-tuning, the current flatness\nof the universe can also then be understood. Finally, recent brane-world\napproaches to the hierarchy problem can be readily realized within this\nframework. \n\n"}

We show that several strangelet species may have\nlarge abundances in the atmosphere; that they should respond favorably to\nlaboratory-scale preconcentration techniques; and that they present promising\ntargets for mass spectroscopy experiments. \n\n"}

The\nelectromagnetic transition amplitudes are calculated up to next-to leading\norder within the framework of pionless effective field theory with dibaryon\nfields. We also calculate the $d\\gamma\\to np$ cross section and the photon\nanalyzing power for the $d\\vec{\\gamma}\\to np$ process from the amplitudes. The\nvalues of low energy constants that appear in the amplitudes are estimated by a\nMarkov Chain Monte Carlo analysis using the relevant low energy experimental\ndata. Our result agrees well with those of other theoretical calculations\nexcept for the $np\\to d\\gamma$ cross section at some energies estimated by an\nR-matrix analysis. We also study the uncertainties in our estimation of the\n$np\\to d\\gamma$ cross section at relevant BBN energies and find that the\nestimated cross section is reliable to within $\\sim$1% error. \n\n"}
