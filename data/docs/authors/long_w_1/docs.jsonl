The case is made by\nshowing that all the observed N and Delta resonances with masses below 2500 MeV\ndistribute fairly well each over the first levels of a unitary representation\nof the conformal group, a representation that covers the spectrum of a\nquark-diquark system, placed directly on the AdS_5 cone, conformally\ncompactified to R^1*S^3. The free geodesic motion on the S^3 manifold is\ndescribed by means of the scalar conformal equation there, which is of the\nKlein-Gordon type. The equation is then gauged by the \"curved\" Coulomb\npotential that has the form of a cotangent function. Conformal symmetry is not\nexact, this because the gauge potential slightly modifies the conformal\ncentrifugal barrier of the free geodesic motion. Thanks to this, the degeneracy\nbetween P11-S11 pairs from same level is relaxed, while the remaining states\nbelonging to same level remain practically degenerate. The model describes the\ncorrect mass ordering in the P11-S11 pairs through the nucleon spectrum as a\ncombined effect of the above conformal symmetry breaking, on the one side, and\na parity change of the diquark from a scalar at low masses, to a pseudoscalar\nat higher masses, on the other.

This discrepancy has led to various, quite different\nexplanations in terms of increased axial masses, changes in the functional form\nof the axial form factor, increased vector strength in nuclei, and initial\ntwo-particle interactions. This is disconcerting since the neutrino energy\nreconstruction depends on the reaction mechanism. Purpose: We investigate\nwhether exclusive observables, such as nucleon knock-out, can be used to\ndistinguish between the various proposed reaction mechanisms. We determine the\ninfluence of 2p-2h excitations on the energy reconstruction. Method: We use the\nGiessen Boltzmann--Uehling--Uhlenbeck (GiBUU) model to predict numbers and\nspectra of knock-out nucleons. The model is extended by incorporating a simple,\nbut realistic treatment of initial 2p-2h excitations. Results: We show numbers\nand spectra of knock-out nucleons and show their sensitivity to the presence of\n2p-2h initial excitations.

Abstract: The maximum mass of a neutron star is generally determined by the equation of\nstate of the star material. In this study, we take into account dark matter\nparticles, assumed to behave like fermions with a free parameter to account for\nthe interaction strength among the particles, as a possible constituent of\nneutron stars. We find dark matter inside the star would soften the equation of\nstate more strongly than that of hyperons, and reduce largely the maximum mass\nof the star. However, the neutron star maximum mass is sensitive to the\nparticle mass of dark matter, and a very high neutron star mass larger than 2\ntimes solar mass could be achieved when the particle mass is small enough. Such\nkind of dark-matter- admixed neutron stars could explain the recent measurement\nof the Shapiro delay in the radio pulsar PSR J1614-2230, which yielded a\nneutron star mass of 2 times solar mass that may be hardly reached when\nhyperons are considered only, as in the case of the microscopic Brueckner\ntheory. Furthermore, in this particular case, we point out that the dark matter\naround a neutron star should also contribute to the mass measurement due to its\npure gravitational effect. However, our numerically calculation illustrates\nthat such contribution could be safely ignored because of the usual diluted\ndark matter environment assumed. We conclude that a very high mass measurement\nof about 2 times solar mass requires a really stiff equation of state in\nneutron stars, and find a strong upper limit (<= 0.64 GeV) for the particle\nmass of non-self- annihilating dark matter based on the present model. \n\n"}

While the two-flavor effective models may be sufficient\nto describe the phenomenon of pion condensation, it is interesting to study the\nroles of the strangeness degree of freedom and the U$_{\\rm A}(1)$ anomaly. In\nthis paper, we present a systematic study of the three-flavor\nNambu--Jona-Lasinio model with a Kobayashi-Maskawa-'t Hooft (KMT) term that\nmimics the U$_{\\rm A}(1)$ anomaly at finite isospin chemical potential. In the\nmean-field approximation, the model predicts a phase transition from the vacuum\nto the pion superfluid phase, which takes place at $\\mu_{\\rm I}$ equal to the\npion mass $m_\\pi$. Due to the U$_{\\rm A}(1)$ anomaly, the strangeness degree of\nfreedom couples to the light quark degrees of freedom and the strange quark\neffective mass depends on the pion condensate. However, the strange quark\ncondensate and the strange quark effective mass change slightly in the pion\nsuperfluid phase, which verifies the validity of the two-flavor models.

Large and regular glitches observed in the\nVela pulsar have originally constrained the fraction of the stellar moment of\ninertia that must reside in the solid crust to about 1.4%. However, crustal\nentrainment-which until very recently has been ignored-suggests that in order\nto account for the Vela glitches, the fraction of the moment of inertia\nresiding in the crust must increase to about 7%. This indicates that the\nrequired angular momentum reservoir may exceed that which is available in the\ncrust. We explore the possibility that uncertainties in the equation of state\nprovide enough flexibility for the construction of models that predict a large\ncrustal thickness and consequently a large crustal moment of inertia.

At tree-level, the emission of a soft gauge\nboson at subleading order in its energy is given by the Low-Burnett-Kroll\ntheorem, with the angular momentum operator acting on a lower-point amplitude.\nFor well separated particles at tree-level, we prove the Low-Burnett-Kroll\ntheorem using matrix elements of subleading SCET Lagrangian and operator\ninsertions which are individually gauge invariant.

This\ndeformation corresponds to a breathing mode, which breaks the inversion\nsymmetry. We find that for intermediate values of the staggered strain, the\ninversion-symmetry broken phase realizes a topological Weyl semimetal. In the\ntemperature-elasticity phase diagram, the Weyl semimetal shows a reentrant\nphase behavior: it can be reached from a symmetric phase realized both at\nhigher and at lower temperatures. The symmetric phase is a Dirac semimetal,\nwhich is protected by the non-symmorphic space group of the pyrochlore lattice.\nBeyond a critical value of the staggered strain, the symmetry-broken phase is a\nfully gapped trivial insulator. The surface states of the Weyl semimetal form\nopen Fermi arcs and we observe that their connectivity depends on the\ntermination of the crystal. In particular, for the $\\{111\\}$ films, the\nsemiclassical closed electronic orbits of the surface states in a magnetic\nfield cross the bulk either twice, four, six or twelve times.

Consequently, cuts\nin $p_t$ modify the experimentally measured cumulants and their ratios. We\ndiscuss the influence of kinematic cuts on the ratio of mean and variance of\nelectric charge fluctuations in a hadron resonance gas, in the light of recent\ndata of the STAR and PHENIX Collaborations.

For a proper interpretation of\nthe data, final-state interactions (FSI) need to be theoretically controlled.\n  Purpose: Our goal is to quantify the role of FSI effects in exclusive\n$A(e,e'pN)$ reactions for four target nuclei representative for the whole mass\nregion. Our focus is on processes that are SRC driven. We investigate the role\nof FSI for two characteristic detector setups corresponding with a \"small\" and\n\"large\" coverage of the available phase space.\n  Results: The transparency $T^{pN}_{A}$, defined as the ratio of exclusive\n$(e,e'pN)$ cross sections on nuclei to those on \"free\" nucleon pairs, drops\nfrom $ 0.2-0.3 $ for $^{12}$C to $0.04-0.07$ for $^{208}$Pb.

The mass dependence\nof FSI effects in exclusive $A(e,e'pN)$ can be captured in a robust power law\nand is in agreement with the predictions obtained in a toy model. \n\n"}

Although electric dipoles are highly attractive\nto couple spin qubits electrically over long distances, mechanisms identified\nto control two-qubit couplings do not permit single-qubit operations while\ntwo-qubit couplings are off. Here we identify a mechanism to modulate\nelectrical coupling of spin qubits that overcomes this drawback for hole spin\nqubits in acceptors,that is based on the electrical tuning of the direction of\nthe spin-dependent electric dipole by a gate. In this way, inter-qubit coupling\ncan be turned off electrically by tuning to a \"magic angle\" of vanishing\nelectric dipole-dipole interactions, while retaining the ability to manipulate\nthe individual qubits. This effect stems from the interplay of the $\\rm T_d$\nsymmetry of the acceptor state in the Si lattice with the magnetic field\norientation, and the spin-3/2 characteristic of hole systems. Magnetic field\ndirection also allows to greatly suppress spin relaxation by phonons that limit\nsingle qubit performance, while retaining sweet spots where the qubits are\ninsensitive to charge noise. Our findings can be directly applied to\nstate-of-the-art acceptor based architectures, for which we propose suitable\nprotocols to practically achieve full electrical tunability of entanglement and\nthe realization of a decoherence-free subspace. \n\n"}

Open-shell nuclei have\nbeen further addressed by implementing variants based on the concept of\nspontaneous symmetry breaking (and restoration).\n  Purpose: In order to access the spectroscopy of open-shell nuclei more\nsystematically while controlling the numerical cost, we design a novel\nmany-body method that combines the merit of breaking and restoring symmetries\nwith those brought about by low-rank individual excitations.\n  Methods: The recently proposed truncated configuration-interaction method\nbased on optimized symmetry-broken and -restored states is extended to the\nz-signature symmetry associated with a discrete subgroup of SU(2). The\nhighly-truncated N-body Hilbert subspace within which the Hamiltonian is\ndiagonalized is spanned by a z-signature broken and restored Slater determinant\nvacuum and associated low-rank excitations.\n  Results: The proposed method provides an excellent reproduction of the\nground-state energy and of low-lying excitation energies of various\nz-signatures and total angular momenta.

Unlike the standard case, satisfying Heisenberg\nuncertainty, here the GUP modified broadening rates, for both deformations, not\nonly depend on the initial size (both in position and momentum space) of the\nwave-packet, but also on the initial probability distribution and momentum of\nthe particle. The new rates of wave-packet broadening, for both situations, are\nmodified by a handful of new terms - such as the skewness and kurtosis\ncoefficients, as well as the (constant) momentum of the particle. Comparisons\nwith the standard Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (HUP)-based results show\npotentially measurable differences in the rates of free wave-packet broadening\nfor physical systems such as the $C_{60}$ and $C_{176}$ molecules, and more so\nfor large organic molecular wave-packets. In doing so, we open a path to scan\nthe GUP parameter space by several orders of magnitude inside the best existing\nupper bounds for both forms of GUP. \n\n"}

Therefore it is likely\nthat thermalization and hydrodynamic description of the gluon system produced\nin heavy ion collisions can not result from perturbative QCD diagrams at these\nlate times. At earlier times with $\\tau \\sim 1/Q_s$ the subleading corrections\nto $\\epsilon$ in $1/\\tau$ expansion (terms scaling like $\\sim\n1/\\tau^{1+\\Delta}$ with $\\Delta >0$) may become important possibly leading to\nhydrodynamic-like behavior of the gluon system. Still, we show that such\ncorrections do not contribute to the particle production cross section, and are\nlikely to be irrelevant for physical observables.

In our scenario,\nrapid initial heating of the parton system provides a driving force for the\nchiral field, moving it away from the true vacuum and forcing it to go to the\nopposite point on the vacuum manifold. This converts the entire hot region into\na single DCC domain. Subsequent rolling down of the chiral field to its true\nvacuum will then lead to emission of a large number of (approximately) coherent\npions. The requirement of suppression of thermal fluctuations to maintain the\n(approximate) coherence of such a large DCC domain, favors three dimensional\nexpansion of the plasma over the longitudinal expansion even at very early\nstages of evolution. This also constrains the maximum temperature of the system\nto lie within a window. We roughly estimate this window to be about 200 - 400\nMeV. These results lead us to predict that extremely high energy collisions of\n{\\it very small nuclei} (possibly hadrons) are better suited for observing\nsignatures of a large DCC. Another possibility is to focus on {\\it peripheral}\ncollisions of heavy nuclei. \n\n"}

We discuss Discrete Light-Cone Quantization (DLCQ) which was first\nintroduced by Maskawa and Yamawaki (MY). Following MY, we present canonical\nformalism of DLCQ and the zero-mode constraint through which the zero mode can\nactually be solved away in terms of other modes,thus establishing the trivial\nvacuum. Due to this trivial vacuum, existence of the massless Nambu-Goldstone\n(NG) boson coupled to the current is guaranteed by the non-conserved charge\nsuch that Q |0> = 0 and dot{Q} ne 0. The SSB (NG phase) in DLCQ can be realized\non the trivial vacuum only when an explicit symmetry-breaking mass of the NG\nboson m_{pi} is introduced so that the NG-boson zero mode integrated over the\nLF exhibits singular behavior sim 1/m_{pi}^2 in such a way that dot{Q} ne 0 in\nthe symmetric limit m_{pi} -> 0.

Abstract: Entropy production in the compression stage of heavy ion collisions is\ndiscussed within three distinct macroscopic models (i.e. generalized RHTA,\ngeometrical overlap model and three-fluid hydrodynamics). We find that within\nthese models \\sim 80% or more of the experimentally observed final-state\nentropy is created in the early stage. It is thus likely followed by a nearly\nisentropic expansion. We employ an equation of state with a first-order phase\ntransition. For low net baryon density, the entropy density exhibits a jump at\nthe phase boundary. However, the excitation function of the specific entropy\nper net baryon, S/A, does not reflect this jump. This is due to the fact that\nfor final states (of the compression) in the mixed phase, the baryon density\n\\rho_B increases with \\sqrt{s}, but not the temperature T. Calculations within\nthe three-fluid model show that a large fraction of the entropy is produced by\nnuclear shockwaves in the projectile and target. With increasing beam energy,\nthis fraction of S/A decreases. At \\sqrt{s}=20 AGeV it is on the order of the\nentropy of the newly produced particles around midrapidity.
