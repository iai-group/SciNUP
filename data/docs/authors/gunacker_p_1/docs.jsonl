Moreover, it is\nargued that the system is dynamically inhomogeneous, with short-range charge\nand spin correlations that slowly evolve with MC time, producing the glassy\ncharacteristics of the CMR state.

We study systematically the\neffects of pairing fluctuations and address all filling fractions over the\nentire range of attractive interaction strength. While the attractive Hubbard\nmodel can be regarded as the generalization of BCS to Bose Einstein\ncondensation (BEC) crossover to a lattice, we find that the BEC limit of this\nHubbard model is very different from that of jellium, owing to the strong\ninter-site repulsion between pairs, which becomes important near half filling\nwhen the on-site attraction is strong. A central conclusion of our work is that\nin a lattice, around half filling, the smooth evolution from the BCS to the BEC\nlimits is interrupted. For the attractive Hubbard model, $T_c$ vanishes when\nthe system approaches the bosonic regime with increasing interaction strength.\nWe suggest that the vanishing of $T_c$ at strong coupling strength may signal a\nquantum critical transition to another form of superfluid not continuously\nconnected to a BCS-like phase.

We introduce the concept of \\emph{gapped quantum\nliquid} as a special kind of gapped quantum states that can \"dissolve\" any\nproduct states on additional sites. Topologically ordered states actually\ncorrespond to gapped quantum liquids with stable ground-state degeneracy.\nSymmetry-breaking states for on-site symmetry are also gapped quantum liquids,\nbut with unstable ground-state degeneracy. (2) We point out that the\nuniversality classes of generalized local unitary (gLU) transformations\n(without any symmetry) contain both topologically ordered states and\nsymmetry-breaking states. This allows us to use a gLU invariant -- topological\nentanglement entropy -- to probe the symmetry-breaking properties hidden in the\nexact ground state of a finite system, which does not break any symmetry.

We show\nanalytically that in the limit of strong rung couplings these models can be\nmapped onto effective 1D models. These effective models can either be gapped\nmodels of hole pairs, or gapless models described by $t$--$J$ (or modified\n$t$--$J$--$V$) chains of Fibonacci anyons, whose spectrum exhibits a\nfractionalization into charge and anyon degrees of freedom. By using exact\ndiagonalizations for two-leg and three-leg ladders, we show that indeed the\ndoped ladders show exactly the same behavior as that of $t$--$J$ chains. In the\nstrong ferromagnetic rung limit, we can obtain a new model that hosts two\ndifferent kinds of Fibonacci particles - which we denote as the heavy $\\tau$'s\nand light $\\tau$'s. These two particle types carry the same (non-Abelian)\ntopological charge but different (Abelian) electric charges. Once again, we map\nthe two-dimensional ladder onto an effective chain carrying these heavy and\nlight $\\tau$'s. We perform a finite size scaling analysis to show the\nappearance of gapless modes for certain anyon densities whereas a topological\ngapped phase is suggested for another density regime. \n\n"}

For arbitrary external\nconfining potentials the local exchanges are given by highly non-trivial\ngeometric factors that depend solely on the geometry of the confinement through\nthe single-particle eigenstates of the external potential. To obtain accurate\neffective Hamiltonians to describe such systems one needs to be able to compute\nthese geometric factors with high precision which is difficult due to the\ncomputational complexity of the high-dimensional integrals involved. An\napproach using the local density approximation would therefore be a most\nwelcome approximation due to its simplicity.

We do this by first\nconstructing a holographic $c$-function using causal horizon in the black brane\ngeometry. The UV value of the $c$-function is $a_{UV}$ and then it decreases\nmonotonically to zero at the curvature singularity. Intuitively, the behavior\nof the $c$-function can be understood if we recognize that the dual CFT is in a\nthermal state and thermal states are effectively massive with a gap set by the\ntemperature. In field theory, logarithmic entanglement negativity is an\nentanglement measure for mixed states. For example, in two dimensional CFTs on\ninfinite line at finite temperature, the renormalized entanglement negativity\nof an interval has UV (Low- T) value $c_{UV}$ and IR (High-T) value zero. So\nthis is a potential candidate for our $c$-function. In four dimensions we\nexpect the same thing to hold on physical grounds. Now since the causal horizon\ngoes behind the black brane horizon the holographic $c$-function is sensitive\nto the physics of the interior. Correspondingly the field theory $c$-function\nshould also contain information about the interior. So our results suggest that\nhigh temperature (IR) expansion of the negativity (or any candidate\n$c$-function) may be a way to probe part of the physics near the singularity.\nNegativity at finite temperature depends on the full operator content of the\ntheory and so perhaps this can be be done in specific cases only.\n  The existence of this $c$-function in the bulk is an extreme example of the\nparadigm that space-time is built out of entanglement. In particular the fact\nthat the $c$-function reaches zero at the curvature singularity correlates the\ntwo facts : loss of quantum entanglement in the IR field theory and the end of\ngeometry in the bulk which in this case is the formation of curvature\nsingularity. \n\n"}

In\nthis paper, we present a generic lattice construction (in three dimensions) for\na generalized X-cube model of fracton order, where the mobility restrictions of\nthe subdimensional particles inherit the geometry of the lattice. This helps\nexplain a previous result that lattice curvature can produce a robust GSD, even\non a manifold with trivial topology.

In\none example, the lattice geometry confines the dimension-1 particles to small\nloops, which allows the fractons to be fully mobile charges, and the resulting\nphase is equivalent to (3+1)-dimensional toric code. However, the phase is\nsensitive to more than just lattice curvature; different lattices without\ncurvature (e.g. cubic or stacked kagome lattices) also result in different\nphases of matter, which are separated by phase transitions.

We are able to identify stabilizer size\ndistributions characterizing the area law, volume law and critical 'fixed\npoints.' We also discuss Floquet random circuits, where the answers depend on\nthe order of limits - one order of limits yields area law entanglement for any\nnon-zero measurement rate, whereas a different order of limits allows for an\narea law - volume law transition. Finally, we provide a rigorous argument that\na system subjected to projective measurements can only exhibit a volume law\nentanglement entropy if it also features a subleading correction term, which\nprovides a universal signature of projective dynamics in the high-entanglement\nphase.

Consistent with quite generic hydrodynamic treatment, similar to double\nlayer graphene systems we find two branches of plasmons. The in-phase\noscillations of the two layers disperses as $\\sqrt q$, while the out-of-phase\nmode disperses as $q$. When even one of the layers hosts tilted Dirac cone\nspectrum, the plasmonic kink which is a salient feature of a monolayer of\ntilted Dirac cone is inherited by both of these branches. In double layers\ncomposed of graphene (nontilted) and borophene (tilted) where the two layers\nhave two different Fermi velocities, the velocity scale of plasmonic modes is\nset by the greater of the two.

By \"virtual\" we denote those bath excitations which were\nemitted by the system, but eventually will be reabsorbed before any measurement\nof the bath state. A favourable property of the virtual cloud is that the\nnumber of its quanta is expected to saturate on long times, since physically\nthis cloud is a (retarded) polarization of the bath around the system.\nTherefore, the joint state of open system and of virtual cloud (the dressed\nstate) can be accurately represented in a truncated basis of Fock states, on a\nwide time scale.

We clarify that they offer\ncomplementary methods of treating the screening and should serve for different\npurposes. In the GW method, the renormalization of bare on-site Coulomb\ninteractions between 3d electrons occurs mainly through the screening by the\nsame 3d electrons, treated in the random phase approximation (RPA). The basic\ndifference of the constraint-LDA method is that it deals with the neutral\nprocesses, where the Coulomb interactions are additionally screened by the\n``excited'' electron, since it continues to stay in the system. This is the\nmain channel of screening by the itinerant ($4sp$) electrons, which is\nespecially strong in the case of transition metals and missing in the GW\napproach, although the details of this screening may be affected by additional\napproximations, which typically supplement these two methods. The major\ndrawback of the conventional constraint-LDA method is that it does not allow to\ntreat the energy-dependence of $U$.

Here, we study\nthe intermediate-density electron gas confined to a circular disc, where the\ndegree of confinement can be tuned to control the density. Using accurate\nquantum Monte Carlo techniques, we show that the electron-electron correlation\ninduced by an increase of the interaction first smoothly causes rings, and then\nangular modulation, without any signature of a sharp transition in this density\nrange.

However, if there is randomness in the isotropic part of the exchange or\nin the transverse field then in a non-zero transverse field the anisotropy\ntransition is destroyed by the disorder. We show that in the Griffiths' phase\nnear the Ising transition that the ground state energy has an essential\nsingularity. The results obtained for the dynamical critical exponent, the\ntypical correlation length, and the temperature dependence of the specific heat\nnear the Ising transition agree with the results of the RSRGDT and numerical\nwork. \n\n"}

The zero-field energy\ngap of the lowest spin gap excitation shows a splitting into two triplet modes\nand the energy splitting clearly depends on the magnetic field orientation when\na field is rotated in the {\\mib {ac}}-plane.

We now extend our CPA treatment to the case of\ngeneral S and spin polarization. We show that Kubo's one-electron CPA is always\nrecovered in the empty-band limit and that our CPA is equivalent to dynamical\nmean field theory in the classical spin limit. We then solve our CPA equations\nself-consistently to obtain the static magnetic susceptibility chi in the\nstrong-coupling limit. As in the case of the CPA for the Hubbard model we find\nunphysical behaviour in chi at half-filling and no magnetic transition for any\nfinite S.
