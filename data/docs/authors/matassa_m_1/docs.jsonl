The twisted Hochschild cycle representing an\norientation is related to the volume form of the distinguished covariant\ndifferential calculus. Integration over the volume form defines a twisted\ncyclic 2-cocycle which computes the q-winding numbers of quantum line bundles.\nSecond, a \"twisted\" Chern character from equivariant K0-theory to even twisted\ncyclic homology is introduced which gives rise to a Chern-Connes pairing\nbetween equivariant K0-theory and twisted cyclic cohomology.

If we can consider the entanglement entropy as thermodynamic entropy, we\ncan see the entropic force acting on the two black holes from the $r$\ndependence of $S_C$. We develop the computational method based on that of\nBombelli et al to obtain the $r$ dependence of $S_C$ of scalar fields whose\nLagrangian is quadratic with respect to the scalar fields. First we study $S_C$\nin $d+1$ dimensional Minkowski spacetime. In this case the state of the\nmassless free scalar field is the Minkowski vacuum state and we replace two\nblack holes by two imaginary spheres, and we take the trace over the degrees of\nfreedom residing in the imaginary spheres. We obtain the leading term of $S_C$\nwith respect to $1/r$.

We do not calculate\n$G(R_1,R_2)$ in detail, but we show how to calculate it. In the black hole case\nwe use the method used in the Minkowski spacetime case with some modifications.\nWe show that $S_C$ can be expected to be the same form as that in the Minkowski\nspacetime case. But in the black hole case, $S_A$ and $S_B$ depend on $r$, so\nwe do not fully obtain the $r$ dependence of $S_C$. Finally we assume that the\nentanglement entropy can be regarded as thermodynamic entropy, and consider the\nentropic force acting on two black holes. We argue how to separate the\nentanglement entropic force from other force and how to cancel $S_A$ and $S_B$\nwhose $r$ dependence are not obtained.

We construct asymptotically AdS\nsolutions of Einstein's gravity dual to such processes at strong coupling,\nperturbatively in the amplitude expansion, where the expansion parameter is the\nratio of the amplitude of the non-hydrodynamic shear-stress tensor to the\npressure. At each order, we sum over all time derivatives through exact\nrecursion relations.

At the linear order, this equation of motion\nimplies that the metric perturbations are composed of zero wavelength\nquasinormal modes.

By considering coupling of the crustal modes to the\ncontinuum of Alfven modes in the core, we construct a fully relativistic\ndynamical model of the magnetar which allows: i) Fast and long simulations\nwithout numerical dissipation. ii) Very fine sampling of the stellar structure.\nWe find that the presence of strong magnetic field in the crust results in\nlocalizing of some high-frequency crustal elasto-magnetic modes with the radial\nnumber n>1 to the regions of the crust where the field is nearly horizontal.\nWhile the hydro-magnetic coupling of these localized modes to the Alfven\ncontinuum in the core is reduced, their energy is drained on a time-scale much\nless than 1 second. Therefore the puzzle of the observed QPOs with frequencies\nlarger than 600 Hz still stands. \n\n"}

Here we give a general frame work of the\nexisting tunneling mechanism, both the radial null geodesic and Hamilton Jacobi\nmethods. On the radial null geodesic method side, we study the modifications to\nthe tunneling rate, Hawking temperature and the Bekenstein- Hawking area law by\nincluding the back reaction as well as non-commutative effects in the\nspace-time. A reformulation of the Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) method is first\nintroduced. Based on this, a close connection between the quantum tunneling and\nthe gravitational anomaly mechanisms to discuss Hawking effect, is put\nforwarded. An interesting advantage of this reformulated HJ method is that one\ncan get directly the emission spectrum from the event horizon of the black\nhole, which was missing in the earlier literature. Also, the quantization of\nthe entropy and area of a black hole is discussed in this method. Another part\nof the thesis is the introduction of a new type of global embedding of curved\nspace-time to higher dimensional Minkowskian space-time (GEMS). Using this a\nunified description of the Hawking and Unruh effects is given. Advantage of\nthis approach is, it simplifies as well as generalises the conventional\nembedding. In addition to the spherically symmetric space-times, the\nKerr-Newman black hole is exemplified.

Second, in our\nD-dimensional spacetime (maybe D=4), classical defects of any possible\ncodimension should be compatible. These matching conditions fail to accept\ncodimension-2 and 3 defects for D=4 (which represents effectively the spacetime\nat certain length and energy scales) and most probably fail to accept high\nenough codimensional defects for any D since there is no high enough Lovelock\ndensity to support them.

The thermodynamics of these holes is\ncharacterized by heat capacities that may have both signs depending on the\nparameters of the theory. Leaving aside the normal Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black\nhole, it is shown that only some phantom black holes of both classes exhibit\ncritical phenomena. The two classes share a nonextremality, but special,\ncritical point where the transition is continuous and the heat capacity, at\nconstant charge, changes sign with an infinite discontinuity. This point yields\na classification scheme for critical points. It is concluded that the two\nunstable and stable phases coexist on one side of the criticality state and\ndisappear on the other side, that is, there is no configuration where only one\nphase exists. The sinh class has an extremality critical point where the\nentropy diverges. The transition from extremality to nonextremality with the\ncharge held constant is accompanied by a loss of mass and an increase in the\ntemperature. A special case of this transition is when the hole is isolated\n(microcanonical ensemble), it will evolve by emission of energy, which results\nin a decrease of its mass, to the final state of minimum mass and vanishing\nheat capacity. The Ehrenfest scheme of classification is inaccurate in this\ncase but the generalized one due to Hilfer leads to conclude that the\ntransition is of order less than unity.

The asymmetry, which is presumed to be elemental, is\nrepresented by equations of motion and conservation laws that operate\ndifferently over time and space. If, however, the asymmetry was found to be due\nto deeper causes, this conventional view of time evolution would need\nreworking. Here we show, using a sum-over-paths formalism, that a violation of\ntime reversal (T) symmetry might be such a cause.

In this case, equations of motion and\nconservation laws are undefined or inapplicable.

Moreover, the states satisfy an equation of motion (the\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equation) and conservation laws apply.

Fiber bundles over a space or space time manifold, M, are\ndescribed. The fiber consists of a collection of many real or complex number\nstructures and vector space structures. The structures are parameterized by a\nreal or complex scaling factor, s. A vector space at a fiber level, s, has, as\nscalars, real or complex number structures at the same level.

In case of selfinteracting massive vector mesons the situation\nbecomes even more peculiar in that the usually renormalizability guaranteeing\nvalidity of the first order power-counting criterion breaks down in second\norder and requires the compensatory presence of additional Hermitian H-fields.\nSome aspect of these observation have already been noticed in the BRST gauge\ntheoretic formulation, but here we use a new setting based on string-local\nvector mesons which is required by Hilbert space positivity. The coupling to\nH-fields induces Mexican hat like selfinteractions; they are not imposed and\nbear no relation with spontaneous symmetry breaking; they are rather\nconsequences of the foundational causal localization properties realized in a\nHilbert space setting. In case of selfinteracting massive vectormesons their\npresence is required in order to maintain the first order power-counting\nrestriction of renormalizability also in second order. The presentation of the\nnew Hilbert space setting for vector mesons which replaces gauge theory and\nextends on-shell unitarity to its off-shell counterpart is the main motivation\nfor this work. The new Hilbert space setting also shows that the second order\nLie-algebra structure of selfinteracting vector mesons is a consequence of the\nprinciples of QFT and promises a deeper understanding of the origin of\nconfinement. \n\n"}

While the luminosity and timescale are suggestive of\nfast radio bursts (FRBs; millisecond-scale radio transients) NS--BH coalescence\nrates are too low to make these a primary FRB source. Instead, we propose the\ntransients form a FRB sub-population, distinguishable by a double peak with a\nprecursor.

One can thus conceive the space-time manifold as a purely\ntheoretical arena, where quantum states are defined, with the additional\nfreedom of changing coordinates like any other symmetry. Observables, including\npositions and distances, should then be described by suitable operators acting\non such quantum states. In principle, the top-down (canonical) quantisation of\nEinstein-Hilbert gravity falls right into this picture, but is notoriously very\ninvolved. The complication stems from allowing all the classical canonical\nvariables that appear in the (presumably) fundamental action to become quantum\nobservables acting on the \"superspace\" of all metrics, regardless of whether\nthey play any role in the description of a specific physical system. On can\ninstead revisit the more humble \"minisuperspace\" approach and choose the\ngravitational observables not simply by imposing some symmetry, but motivated\nby their proven relevance in the (classical) description of a given system. In\nparticular, this review focuses on compact, spherically symmetric, quantum\nmechanical sources, in order to determine the probability they are black holes\nrather than regular particles. The gravitational radius is therefore lifted to\nthe status of a quantum mechanical operator acting on the \"horizon\nwave-function\", the latter being determined by the quantum state of the source.\nThis formalism is then applied to several sources with a mass around the\nfundamental scale, which are viewed as natural candidates of quantum black\nholes. \n\n"}

In this paper, we review the main features of\nthese hairy black hole solutions, such as their geometrical and thermodynamical\nproperties. The conformal coupling to matter in dimension $D>4$ in principle\nincludes higher-curvature terms. These couplings are obtained from the Lovelock\naction through the Stueckelberg strategy.

Previous studies of this type\ntreated the NS core as a normal fluid and thus did not account for its expected\nsuperfluidity. The source of buoyancy that supports the g modes is\nfundamentally different in the two cases: in a normal fluid core the buoyancy\nis due to gradients in the proton-to-neutron fraction whereas in a superfluid\ncore it is due to gradients in the muon-to-electron fraction. The latter yields\na stronger stratification and a superfluid NS therefore has a denser spectrum\nof g modes with frequencies above 10 Hz. As a result, many more g modes undergo\nresonant tidal excitation as the binary sweeps through the bandwidth of GW\ndetectors such as LIGO. We find that roughly 10 times more orbital energy is\ntransferred into g mode oscillations if the NS has a superfluid core rather\nthan a normal fluid core.

We then exploit this freedom to\neliminate all interactions except those exhibiting two sets of independently\ncontracted Lorentz indices. The resulting action is local, remarkably simple,\nand naturally expressed in a field basis analogous to the exponential\nparameterization of the nonlinear sigma model.

Here the\nquantum nuclear shell model is adopted to describe the permitted energy levels\nof the SB, which are assumed to be identical to the discrete spinning rates\n$\\Omega_{SB},$ that SBs are allowed to rotate with. Accordingly, a glitch-event\ncorresponds to a prompt spin-down of the superconducting SB from one energy\nlevel to the next, thereby expelling a certain number of vortices, which in\nturn spins-up the ambient medium. The process is provoked mainly by the\nnegative torque of the ambient dissipative nuclear fluid and by a universal\nscalar field $\\phi$ at the background of a supranuclear dense matter.

The most basic form of an interaction is the\nfirst order Fermi acceleration (deceleration) of a laser photon as it is\nreflected by a test mass mirror oscillating in the gravitational wave,\nresulting in a frequency blueshift (redshift) of the photon depending on\nwhether the mirror is advancing towards (receding from) the photon before the\nreflection.

The collapse violently snaps the magnetic-field lines\nanchored on the stellar surface, thus producing an electromagnetic pulse that\nwill propagate outwards and accelerate electrons producing a massive radio\nburst, i.e. a \"blitzar\". We present a systematic study of the gravitational\ncollapse of rotating and magnetised neutron stars with special attention to\nfar-field evolution at late times after the collapse.

This reduction is primarily due to the\ngrowth in binary's eccentricity at the tidal encounter. We also investigate the\neffective spins of the survivors, assuming that BH spins are initially aligned\nwith the binary orbital angular momentum.

Notably, Planck cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB) and the local Cepheid-supernovae distance ladder\nmeasurements determine $H_0$ with a precision of $\\sim 1\\%$ and $\\sim 2\\%$\nrespectively. A $3$-$\\sigma$ level of discrepancy exists between the two\nmeasurements, for reasons that have yet to be understood.

This measurement does not assume a\ncosmological model and is independent of a cosmic distance ladder. The first\njoint analysis of the GW signal from GW170817 and its EM localization led to a\nmeasurement of $H_0=74^{+16}_{-8}$ km/s/Mpc (median and symmetric $68\\%$\ncredible interval).

Although both yield the same IR-finite rates, we\npoint out that they are not equivalent since they encode different infrared\nscales.

One important singularity is identified by the\nvanishing of the total energy, where the wavefunction reduces to the physics of\nscattering in flat space. In this paper, we discuss the behaviour of the\nperturbative wavefunction as its other singularities are approached and the\nrole played by the flat-space scattering, in the simplified context of the\nclass of toy models admitting a first principle definition in terms of\ncosmological polytopes. The problems then translates into the analysis of the\nstructure of its facets, one of which -- the scattering facet -- beautifully\nencodes the flat-space S-matrix. We show that all the boundaries of the\ncosmological polytope encode information about the flat-space physics. In\nparticular, a subset of its facets turns out to have a similar structure as the\nscattering facet, with the vertices which can be grouped together to form lower\ndimensional scattering facets. The other facets admit one (and only one)\ntriangulation in terms of products of lower dimensional scattering facets. As a\nconsequence, the whole perturbative wavefunction can be represented as a sum of\nproduct of flat-space scattering amplitudes. Finally, we turn the table around\nand ask whether the knowledge of the flat-space scattering amplitudes suffices\nto reconstruct the wavefunction of the universe. We show that, at least for our\nclass of toy models, this is indeed the case at tree level if we are also\nprovided with a subset of symmetries that the wavefunction ought to satisfy.\nOnce the tree cosmological polytopes are reconstructed, the loop ones can be\nobtained as a particular projection of them. \n\n"}

With the help of specific examples, it is demonstrated\nthat the shape functions of the exact wormhole models previously constructed do\nobey the necessary metric conditions.

The mere reason why that\nsubstitution was performed at all is that in the non -- Abelean case the volume\noperator, pivotal for the definition of the dynamics, is not diagonisable by\nanalytical methods.

The equations of motion in the bulk is solved using a low energy\nexpansion method. This allows us, through the junction conditions, to deduce\nthe effective equations of motion for the gravity on the brane. It is shown\nthat the gravity on the brane world is described by a quasi-scalar-tensor\ntheory with a specific coupling function omega(Psi) = 3 Psi / 2(1-Psi) on the\npositive tension brane and omega(Phi) = -3 Phi / 2(1+Phi) on the negative\ntension brane, where Psi and Phi are non-linear realizations of the radion on\nthe positive and negative tension branes, respectively. In contrast to the\nusual scalar-tensor gravity, the quasi-scalar-tensor gravity couples with two\nkinds of matter, namely, the matters on both positive and negative tension\nbranes, with different effective gravitational coupling constants. In\nparticular, the radion disguised as the scalar fields Psi and Phi couples with\nthe sum of the traces of the energy momentum tensor on both branes.

For these boundary\nconditions, classically there are either two black hole solutions or no\nsolution.

Two situations are considered: First, if the\nspacetime has a bifurcate Killing horizon, as is the case in the presence of\nblack holes, then restricting the observables to the Killing horizon together\nwith \"modular covariance\" for the Killing flow yields a conformally covariant\nquantum field theory on the circle and a conformal spin-statistics theorem for\ncharged sectors localizable on the Killing horizon. Secondly, if the spacetime\nhas a rotation and PT symmetry like the Schwarzschild-Kruskal black holes,\n\"geometric modular action\" of the rotational symmetry leads to a\nspin-statistics theorem for charged covariant sectors where the spin is defined\nvia the SU(2)-covering of the spatial rotation group SO(3). \n\n"}

It is\nshown that under certain index conditions the link invaraints colored by the\nrepresentations of coset factorize into the products of the the link invaraints\ncolored by the representations of the two groups in the coset. But the\n3-manifold invariants do not behave so simply in general due to the nontrivial\nbranching and selection rules of the coset. Examples in the parafermion cosets\nand diagonal cosets show that 3-manifold invariants of the coset may be finer\nthan the products of the 3-manifold invariants associated with the two groups\nin the coset, and these two invariants do not seem to be simply related in some\ncases, for an example, in the cases when there are issues of ``fixed point\nresolutions''. In the later case our framework provides a representation theory\nunderstanding of the underlying unitary modular categories which has not been\nobtained by other methods. \n\n"}

However,\ndifferentials of higher order are useful objects that can be interpreted in\nterms of functions on iterated tangent bundles (or in terms of jets). We\ngeneralize this notion to the case of non commutative differential geometry.\nFor an arbitrary associative algebra A, one already knows how to define the\ndifferential algebra Omega(A) of universal differential forms over A. We define\nLeibniz forms of order n (these are not forms of degree n, ie they are not\nelements of Omega^n A) as particular elements of what we call the ``iterated\nframe algebra'' of order n, F_n A, which is itself defined as the 2^n tensor\npower of the algebra A. We give a system of generators for this iterated frame\nalgebra and identify the A-module of forms of order n as a particular vector\nsubspace included in the space of universal one-forms built over the iterated\nframe algebra of order n-1.
