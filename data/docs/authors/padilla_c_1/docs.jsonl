Measurements using bispectrum of cosmic microwave background\nanisotropies are limited by the cosmic variance, i.e. available number of\nmodes. Recent work has emphasized the possibility to probe non-gaussianity of\nlocal type using the scale dependence of large scale bias from highly biased\ntracers of large scale structure. However, this power spectrum method is also\nlimited by cosmic variance, finite number of structures on the largest scales,\nand by the partial degeneracy with other cosmological parameters that can mimic\nthe same effect. Here we propose an alternative method that solves both of\nthese problems. It is based on the idea that on large scales halos are biased,\nbut not stochastic, tracers of dark matter: by correlating a highly biased\ntracer of large scale structure against an unbiased tracer one eliminates the\ncosmic variance error, which can lead to a high signal to noise even from the\nstructures comparable to the size of the survey.

These shifts persist for\ndark matter halos, and are a simple function of halo bias, with the shift\n(mostly) increasing with increasing bias. Extending our perturbation theory\nresults to halos with simple two parameter bias models (both in Lagrangian and\nEulerian space) quantitatively explains the observed shifts. In particular, we\ndemonstrate that there are additional terms that contribute to the shift that\nare absent for the matter. At z=0 for currently favored cosmologies, the matter\nshows shifts of ~0.5%, b=1 halos shift the acoustic scale by ~0.2%, while b=2\nhalos shift it by ~0.5%; these shifts decrease by the square of the growth\nfactor at higher redshifts.

On approximately day four after the\nexplosion, a dramatic upturn in the u and uvw1 (lambda_c = 2600 Angstroms)\nlight curves occurred after an initial rapid decline which is attributed to\nadiabatic cooling after the initial shock breakout. This rapid decline and\nupturn is reminiscent of the Type IIb SN 1993J on day six after the explosion.\nOptical/near-IR spectra taken around the peak reveal prominent H-alpha, HeI,\nand CaII absorption lines. A fading X-ray source is also located at the\nposition of SN 2008ax, implying an interaction of the SN shock with the\nsurrounding circumstellar material and a mass-loss rate of the progenitor of\nM_dot = (9+/-3)x10^-6 solar masses per year.

We parametrize the\nsingle-band variability by a power-law model for the light-curve structure\nfunction, with amplitude A and power-law index gamma. We show that quasars can\nbe efficiently separated from other non-variable and variable sources by the\nlocation of the individual sources in the A-gamma plane. We use ~60 epochs of\nimaging data, taken over ~5 years, from the SDSS stripe 82 (S82) survey, where\nextensive spectroscopy provides a reference sample of quasars, to demonstrate\nthe power of variability as a quasar classifier in multi-epoch surveys. For\nUV-excess selected objects, variability performs just as well as the standard\nSDSS color selection, identifying quasars with a completeness of 90% and a\npurity of 95%. In the redshift range 2.5<z<3, where color selection is known to\nbe problematic, variability can select quasars with a completeness of 90% and a\npurity of 96%. This is a factor of 5-10 times more pure than existing\ncolor-selection of quasars in this redshift range. Selecting objects from a\nbroad griz color box without u-band information, variability selection in S82\ncan afford completeness and purity of 92%, despite a factor of 30 more\ncontaminants than quasars in the color-selected feeder sample. This confirms\nthat the fraction of quasars hidden in the 'stellar locus' of color-space is\nsmall. To test variability selection in the context of Pan-STARRS 1 (PS1) we\ncreated mock PS1 data by down-sampling the S82 data to just 6 epochs over 3\nyears. Even with this much sparser time sampling, variability is an\nencouragingly efficient classifier.

The primary limitation of these calculations is now\ncomputational. In particular, it is difficult to model systems with large mass\nratio and large spins, since one must accurately resolve the multiple\nlengthscales which play a role in such systems.

For either a constant or a $b(\\phi)$ coupling, inflationary\ntrajectories are modified but anisotropies increase; In particular, for the\nformer coupling we find that a quadratic inflaton potential, within a constant\nratio for the scalar and gauge energy densities, does not induce sufficient\ninflation, while in the latter the back-reaction in the cosmology determines\n(from the tensor-scalar ratio) a narrow range where inflation can occur.

These theorems, which are in fact generalized Noether theorems, have\nseveral nontrivial ramifications. One immediate consequence is the necessity to\nre-evaluate some of the default characterizations of the original Noether\ntheorems as general statements - for instance, the statement that every global\ninvariance of the action gives rise to a conserved current. As it turns out,\nthis latter statement remains valid, but apparently only as a consequence of\nboth the generalized first and second Noether theorem (at any rate, it is very\nfar from clear how to avoid such a conclusion).

At such points,\nthe adiabatic approximation to the orbital evolution breaks down, and there is\na brief but order unity correction to the inspiral rate. Corrections to the\ngravitational wave signal's phase due to resonance effects scale as the square\nroot of the inverse of mass of the small body, and thus become large in the\nextreme-mass-ratio limit, dominating over all other post-adiabatic effects.

We model the disk\nmatter using the ideal fluid approximation with a $\\Gamma$-law equation of\nstate with $\\Gamma=4/3$. We explore three disk models around non-rotating black\nholes with disk-to-black hole mass ratios of 0.24, 0.17 and 0.11. Due to metric\nblending in our initial data, all of our initial models contain an initial\naxisymmetric perturbation which induces radial disk oscillations. Despite these\noscillations, our models do not develop the runaway instability during the\nfirst several orbital periods. Instead, all of the models develop unstable\nnon-axisymmetric modes on a dynamical timescale. We observe two distinct types\nof instabilities: the Papaloizou-Pringle and the so-called intermediate type\ninstabilities. The development of the non-axisymmetric mode with azimuthal\nnumber m = 1 is accompanied by an outspiraling motion of the black hole, which\nsignificantly amplifies the growth rate of the m = 1 mode in some cases.\nOverall, our simulations show that the properties of the unstable\nnon-axisymmetric modes in our disk models are qualitatively similar to those in\nNewtonian theory. \n\n"}

If we can consider the entanglement entropy as thermodynamic entropy, we\ncan see the entropic force acting on the two black holes from the $r$\ndependence of $S_C$. We develop the computational method based on that of\nBombelli et al to obtain the $r$ dependence of $S_C$ of scalar fields whose\nLagrangian is quadratic with respect to the scalar fields. First we study $S_C$\nin $d+1$ dimensional Minkowski spacetime. In this case the state of the\nmassless free scalar field is the Minkowski vacuum state and we replace two\nblack holes by two imaginary spheres, and we take the trace over the degrees of\nfreedom residing in the imaginary spheres. We obtain the leading term of $S_C$\nwith respect to $1/r$. The result is $S_C=S_A+S_B+\\tfrac{1}{r^{2d-2}}\nG(R_1,R_2)$, where $S_A$ and $S_B$ are the entanglement entropy on the inside\nregion of $A$ and $B$, and $G(R_1,R_2) \\leq 0$. We do not calculate\n$G(R_1,R_2)$ in detail, but we show how to calculate it. In the black hole case\nwe use the method used in the Minkowski spacetime case with some modifications.\nWe show that $S_C$ can be expected to be the same form as that in the Minkowski\nspacetime case. But in the black hole case, $S_A$ and $S_B$ depend on $r$, so\nwe do not fully obtain the $r$ dependence of $S_C$. Finally we assume that the\nentanglement entropy can be regarded as thermodynamic entropy, and consider the\nentropic force acting on two black holes. We argue how to separate the\nentanglement entropic force from other force and how to cancel $S_A$ and $S_B$\nwhose $r$ dependence are not obtained.

One of\nthe key goals of BOSS is to measure the signature of baryon acoustic\noscillations in the distribution of Ly-alpha absorption from the spectra of a\nsample of ~150,000 z>2.2 quasars. Along with measuring the angular diameter\ndistance at z\\approx2.5, BOSS will provide the first direct measurement of the\nexpansion rate of the Universe at z > 2. One of the biggest challenges in\nachieving this goal is an efficient target selection algorithm for quasars over\n2.2 < z < 3.5, where their colors overlap those of stars. During the first year\nof the BOSS survey, quasar target selection methods were developed and tested\nto meet the requirement of delivering at least 15 quasars deg^-2 in this\nredshift range, out of 40 targets deg^-2. To achieve these surface densities,\nthe magnitude limit of the quasar targets was set at g <= 22.0 or r<=21.85.\nWhile detection of the BAO signature in the Ly-alpha absorption in quasar\nspectra does not require a uniform target selection, many other astrophysical\nstudies do. We therefore defined a uniformly-selected subsample of 20 targets\ndeg^-2, for which the selection efficiency is just over 50%.

This scheme combines\ntools from different techniques in General Relativity: It uses a multipolar,\npost-Minkowskian (MPM) expansion for the far-zone metric perturbation (which\nprovides the gravitational waveforms, here taken up to mass hexadecapole and\ncurrent octopole order) and for the local prescription of the self-force (since\nwe are lacking a general prescription for it); a post-Newtonian expansion for\nthe computation of the multipole moments in terms of the trajectories; and a BH\nperturbation theory expansion when treating the trajectories as a sequence of\nself-adjusting Kerr geodesics.

A nonlinear\ntransformation also modifies the redshift space distortions in the same limit,\ngiving rise to a velocity bias. In models with primordial nongaussianity a\nnonlinear transformation generates a scale dependent bias on large scales. We\nderive analytic expressions for these for a general nonlinear transformation.\nThese biases can be expressed entirely in terms of the one point distribution\nfunction (PDF) of the final field and the parameters of the transformation. Our\nanalysis allows one to devise nonlinear transformations with nearly arbitrary\nbias properties, which can be used to increase the signal in the large scale\nclustering limit. We apply the results to the ionizing equilibrium model of\nLyman-alpha forest, in which Lyman-alpha flux F is related to the density\nperturbation delta via a nonlinear transformation. Velocity bias can be\nexpressed as an average over the Lyman-alpha flux PDF. At z=2.4 we predict the\nvelocity bias of -0.1, compared to the observed value of -0.13 +/- 0.03.

Specifically, we perform local and\nglobal simulations of the magnetothermal instability (MTI) and the\nheat-flux-driven buoyancy instability (HBI) and assess the effects of viscosity\non their saturation and astrophysical implications. We find that viscosity has\nonly a modest effect on the saturation of the MTI. As in previous calculations,\nwe find that the MTI can generate nearly sonic turbulent velocities in the\nouter parts of galaxy clusters, although viscosity somewhat suppresses the\nmagnetic field amplification. At smaller radii in cool-core clusters, viscosity\ncan decrease the linear growth rates of the HBI. However, it has less of an\neffect on the HBI's nonlinear saturation, in part because three-dimensional\ninterchange motions (magnetic flux tubes slipping past each other) are not\ndamped by anisotropic viscosity. In global simulations of cool core clusters,\nwe show that the HBI robustly inhibits radial thermal conduction and thus\nprecipitates a cooling catastrophe. The effects of viscosity are, however, more\nimportant for higher entropy clusters. We argue that viscosity can contribute\nto the global transition of cluster cores from cool-core to non cool-core\nstates: additional sources of intracluster turbulence, such as can be produced\nby AGN feedback or galactic wakes, suppress the HBI, heating the cluster core\nby thermal conduction; this makes the ICM more viscous, which slows the growth\nof the HBI, allowing further conductive heating of the cluster core and a\ntransition to a non cool-core state. \n\n"}

The\nso called local bias model, where galaxy density is a function of local matter\ndensity, is frequently discussed as a means to infer the matter power spectrum\nor correlation function from the measured galaxy correlation. However,\ngravitational evolution generates a term quadratic in the tidal tensor and thus\nnon-local in the density field, even if this term is absent in the initial\nconditions (Lagrangian space). Because the term is quadratic, it contributes as\na loop correction to the power spectrum, so the standard linear bias picture\nstill applies on large scales, however, it contributes at leading order to the\nbispectrum for which it is significant on all scales. Such a term could also be\npresent in Lagrangian space if halo formation were influenced by the tidal\nfield.

Because all of the quantities\nare number weighted this approach is well defined even for sparse systems such\nas massive halos, in contrasts to the previous approaches to RSD where velocity\ncorrelations have been explored. We find that the number density weighting\nleads to a strong scale dependence of the bias terms for momentum density\nauto-correlation and cross-correlation with density. This trend becomes more\nsignificant for the more biased halos and leads to an enhancement of RSD power\nrelative to the linear theory. Fingers-of-god effects, which in this formalism\ncome from the correlations of the higher order moments beyond the momentum\ndensity, lead to smoothing of the power spectrum and can reduce this\nenhancement of power, but are relatively small for halos with no small-scale\nvelocity dispersion. In comparison, for a more realistic galaxy sample with\nsatellites the velocity dispersion generated by satellite motions inside the\nhalos leads to a larger power suppression on small scales, but this depends on\nthe satellite fraction. We investigate several statistics such as the\ntwo-dimensional power spectrum, its multipole moments, its powers of mu^2, and\nconfiguration space statistics. Overall we find that the nonlinear effects in\nrealistic galaxy samples such as luminous red galaxies affect the redshift\nspace clustering on very large scales: for example, the quadrupole moment is\naffected by 10% for k<0.1h/mpc, which means that these effects need to be\nunderstood if we want to extract cosmological information from the redshift\nspace distortions. \n\n"}

Theoretical Framework Abstract: We present a new method that simultaneously solves for cosmology and galaxy\nbias on non-linear scales. The method uses the halo model to analytically\ndescribe the (non-linear) matter distribution, and the conditional luminosity\nfunction (CLF) to specify the halo occupation statistics. For a given choice of\ncosmological parameters, this model can be used to predict the galaxy\nluminosity function, as well as the two-point correlation functions of\ngalaxies, and the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal, both as function of scale and\nluminosity. In this paper, the first in a series, we present the detailed,\nanalytical model, which we test against mock galaxy redshift surveys\nconstructed from high-resolution numerical $N$-body simulations. We demonstrate\nthat our model, which includes scale-dependence of the halo bias and a proper\ntreatment of halo exclusion, reproduces the 3-dimensional galaxy-galaxy\ncorrelation and the galaxy-matter cross-correlation (which can be projected to\npredict the observables) with an accuracy better than 10 (in most cases 5)\npercent. Ignoring either of these effects, as is often done, results in\nsystematic errors that easily exceed 40 percent on scales of $\\sim 1\nh^{-1}\\Mpc$, where the data is typically most accurate. Finally, since the\nprojected correlation functions of galaxies are never obtained by integrating\nthe redshift space correlation function along the line-of-sight out to\ninfinity, simply because the data only cover a finite volume, they are still\naffected by residual redshift space distortions (RRSDs).

RSD can be written as a sum over\ndensity weighted velocity moments correlators, with the lowest order being\ndensity, momentum density and stress energy density. We use standard and\nextended perturbation theory (PT) to determine their auto and cross\ncorrelators, comparing them to N-body simulations. We show which of the terms\ncan be modeled well with the standard PT and which need additional terms that\ninclude higher order corrections which cannot be modeled in PT. Most of these\nadditional terms are related to the small scale velocity dispersion effects,\nthe so called finger of god (FoG) effects, which affect some, but not all, of\nthe terms in this expansion, and which can be approximately modeled using a\nsimple physically motivated ansatz such as the halo model.

This finding makes it possible to determine the dark matter\nclustering from measurements of galaxy-galaxy weak lensing and galaxy\nclustering. We present new cosmological parameter constraints based on\nlarge-scale measurements of spectroscopic galaxy samples from the Sloan Digital\nSky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7 (DR7).

Additional information contained\nin the electromagnetic signal, such as the sky location or distance to the\nsource, can help rule out false alarms, and thus lower the necessary threshold\nfor a detection. Here, we develop a framework for determining how much\nsensitivity is added to a gravitational-wave search by triggering on an\nelectromagnetic transient. We apply this framework to a variety of relevant\nelectromagnetic transients, from short GRBs to signatures of r-process heating\nto optical and radio orphan afterglows. We compute the expected rates of\nmulti-messenger observations in the Advanced detector era, and find that\nsearches triggered on short GRBs --- with current high-energy instruments, such\nas Fermi --- and nucleosynthetic `kilonovae' --- with future optical surveys,\nlike LSST --- can boost the number of multi-messenger detections by 15% and\n40%, respectively, for a binary neutron star progenitor model.

To this end, we perform 3D general-relativistic\nsimulations with a 3-species neutrino leakage scheme. The leakage scheme\ncaptures the essential aspects of neutrino cooling, heating, and lepton number\nexchange as predicted by radiation-hydrodynamics simulations. The 27-solar-mass\nprogenitor was studied in 2D by B. Mueller et al. (ApJ 761:72, 2012), who\nobserved strong growth of the SASI while neutrino-driven convection was\nsuppressed. In our 3D simulations, neutrino-driven convection grows from\nnumerical perturbations imposed by our Cartesian grid. It becomes the dominant\ninstability and leads to large-scale non-oscillatory deformations of the shock\nfront. These will result in strongly aspherical explosions without the need for\nlarge-scale SASI shock oscillations. Low-l-mode SASI oscillations are present\nin our models, but saturate at small amplitudes that decrease with increasing\nneutrino heating and vigor of convection. Our results, in agreement with\nsimpler 3D Newtonian simulations, suggest that once neutrino-driven convection\nis started, it is likely to become the dominant instability in 3D.

A\nCMB prior is included in all cases. Focusing on the large-scale, two-point\nfunction information, we find strong synergy between the two probes. The dark\nenergy figure of merit from WL+GC is up to a factor ~2.5 larger than from\neither probe alone. Considering modified gravity, if the growth factor f(z) is\ntreated as a free function, it is very poorly constrained by WL or GC alone,\nbut can be measured at the few percent level by the combination of the two.

Depending on\nthe structure of the stellar progenitor, each of these instabilities can\ndominate the evolution of the gain region prior to the onset of explosion, with\nimplications for the ensuing asymmetries. Here we examine the flow dynamics in\nthe neighborhood of explosion by means of parametric two-dimensional,\ntime-dependent hydrodynamic simulations for which the linear stability\nproperties are well understood. We find that systems for which the convection\nparameter is sub-critical (SASI-dominated) develop explosions once large-scale,\nhigh-entropy bubbles are able to survive for several SASI oscillation cycles.\nThese long-lived structures are seeded by the SASI during shock expansions.\nFinite-amplitude initial perturbations do not alter this outcome qualitatively,\nthough they can lead to significant differences in explosion times.\nSupercritical systems (convection-dominated) also explode by developing\nlarge-scale bubbles, though the formation of these structures is due to buoyant\nactivity.

Abstract: Neutron stars (NSs) are thought to be excellent laboratories for determining\nthe equation of state (EoS) of cold dense matter. Their strong gravity suggests\nthat they can also be used to constrain gravity models. The mass and radius\n(M-R) of a NS both depend on the choice of EoS and gravity, meaning that NSs\ncannot be simultaneously good laboratories for both of these questions. A\nmeasurement of M-R would constrain the less well known physics input. The\nassumption that M-R measurements can be used to constrain EoS-presumes general\nrelativity (GR) is the ultimate model of gravity in the classical regime. We\ncalculate the radial profile of compactness and curvature (square root of the\nfull contraction of the Weyl tensor) within a NS and determine the domain not\nprobed by the Solar System tests of GR. We find that, except for a tiny sphere\nof radius less than a millimeter at the center, the curvature is several orders\nof magnitude above the values present in Solar System tests. The compactness is\nbeyond the solar surface value for r>10 m, and increases by 5 orders of\nmagnitude towards the surface. With the density being only an order of\nmagnitude higher than that probed by nuclear scattering experiments, our\nresults suggest that the employment of GR as the theory of gravity describing\nthe hydrostatic equilibrium of NSs is a rather remarkable extrapolation from\nthe regime of tested validity, as opposed to that of EoS models. Our larger\nignorance of gravity within NSs suggests that a measurement of M-R constrains\ngravity rather than EoS, and given that EoS has yet to be determined by nucleon\nscattering experiments, M-R measurements cannot tightly constrain the gravity\nmodels either. Near the surface the curvature and compactness attain their\nlargest values, while EoS in this region is fairly well known.

However, here we show that omitting the photon\nemission originating from primary and secondary electrons produced in dark\nmatter annihilations, and undergoing diffusion through the Galactic magnetic\nfield, can actually lead to the wrong conclusion. Accounting for this emission,\nwe find that not only are annihilations of ~ 10 GeV particles into a purely\nleptonic final state allowed, but the democratic scenario actually provides a\nbetter fit to the spectrum of the excess than the pure b-bbar channel.

The two\nmajor groups of QPOs -- low-frequency and high-frequency -- have rather\ndifferent properties. That is why they are usually studied separately. In the\nliterature one can find a large number of models for the high-frequency QPOs\nbut not so many for the low-frequency ones.

However, in order to interpret the data for the HF\nQPOs of the observed objects we have to fix a model. Here we propose a simple\ntest which could allow us to sift the models. The test is based on five rather\ngeneral assumptions concerning the nature of the central object in black-hole\nbinaries and the mechanism for the generation of the LF QPOs observed in the\nPDS of such objects. In other words we combine facts that we know about the LF\nand the HF QPOs of several objects and search for conflicts.

Recent numerical simulations with microphysical equation of\nstate suggest the outcome of such events depends on the mass of the neutron\nstars. For less massive systems, simulations favor the formation of a\nhypermassive, quasi-stable neutron star, whose oscillations produce a short,\nhigh frequency burst of gravitational radiation. Its dominant frequency content\nis tightly correlated with the radius of the neutron star, and its measurement\ncan be used to constrain the supranuclear equation of state. In contrast, the\nmerger of higher mass systems results in prompt gravitational collapse to a\nblack hole. We have developed an algorithm which combines waveform\nreconstruction from a morphology-independent search for gravitational wave\ntransients with Bayesian model selection, to discriminate between post-merger\nscenarios and accurately measure the dominant oscillation frequency.

Depending on the total initial mass of the system, and the NS\nequation of state (EOS), the post-merger phase can see a prompt collapse to a\nblack hole, or the formation of a supramassive NS, or even a stable NS. In the\ncase of post-merger NS (PMNS) formation, magnetic field amplification during\nthe merger will produce a magnetar with a large induced mass quadrupole moment,\nand millisecond spin. If the timescale for orthogonalization of the magnetic\nsymmetry axis with the spin axis is sufficiently short the NS will radiate its\nspin down energy primarily via GWs. Here we study this scenario for various\noutcomes of NS formation: we generalise the set of equilibrium states for a\ntwisted torus magnetic configuration to include solutions that, at a fixed\nexterior dipole field, carry a larger magnetic energy reservoir; we hence\ncompute their magnetic ellipticity and the strength of the expected GW signal\nas a function of the magnitude of the dipole and toroidal field. The relative\nnumber of GW detections from PMNSs and from binary NSs is a strong function of\nthe NS equation of state (EOS), being higher (~ 1%) for the stiffest EOSs and\nnegligibly small for the softest ones. For intermediate-stiffness EOSs, such as\nthe n=4/7 polytrope recently used by Giacomazzo \\& Perna or the GM1 used by\nLasky et al., the relative fraction is ~0.3%; correspondingly we estimate a GW\ndetection rate from stable PMNSs of ~ (0.1-1) yr$^{-1}$ with Advanced\ndetectors, and of ~ (100-1000) yr$^{-1}$ with third generation detectors such\nas the Einstein Telescope.

Abstract: The large-scale homogeneity and isotropy of the universe is generally thought\nto imply a well defined background cosmological model. It may not.

Second-order perturbation theory implies that the effect is\nsmall, but suggests that formally the perturbation series may not converge. The\namplitude of the effect is actually determined by the ratio of the Hubble\nscales at matter-radiation equality and today - which are entirely unrelated.\nThis implies that a universe with significantly lower temperature today could\nhave significant backreaction from more power on small scales, and so provides\nthe ideal testing ground for understanding backreaction. We investigate this\nusing two different N-body numerical simulations - a 3D Newtonian and a 1D\nsimulation which includes all relevant relativistic effects. We show that while\nperturbation theory predicts an increasing backreaction as more initial\nsmall-scale power is added, in fact the virialisation of structure saturates\nthe backreaction effect at the same level independently of the equality scale.\nThis implies that backreaction is a small effect independently of initial\nconditions.

The sensitivity of such cross-correlation analyses depends, among\nother things, on the separation between the two detectors: the smaller the\nseparation, the better the sensitivity. Hence, a co-located detector pair is\nmore sensitive to a gravitational-wave background than a non-co-located\ndetector pair. However, co-located detectors are also expected to suffer from\ncorrelated noise from instrumental and environmental effects that could\ncontaminate the measurement of the background.

The shift occurs because the relative\nvelocity is non-zero only within the sound horizon and thus adds to the\ncorrelation function asymmetrically about the BAO peak.

Such metrics often contain\nnaked singularities or closed timelike curves in the vicinity of the compact\nobjects that can limit the applicability of the metrics to compact objects that\ndo not spin rapidly, and generally admit only two constants of motion. The\nexistence of a third constant, however, can facilitate the calculation of\nobservables, because the equations of motion can be written in first-order\nform. In this paper, I design a Kerr-like black hole metric which is regular\neverywhere outside of the event horizon, possesses three independent constants\nof motion, and depends nonlinearly on four free functions that parameterize\npotential deviations from the Kerr metric. This metric is generally not a\nsolution to the field equations of any particular gravity theory, but can be\nmapped to known four-dimensional black hole solutions of modified theories of\ngravity for suitable choices of the deviation functions.

Abstract: We discuss the detection of gravitational-wave backgrounds in the context of\nBayesian inference and suggest a practical definition of what it means for a\nsignal to be considered stochastic---namely, that the Bayesian evidence favors\na stochastic signal model over a deterministic signal model. A signal can\nfurther be classified as Gaussian-stochastic if a Gaussian signal model is\nfavored. In our analysis we use Bayesian model selection to choose between\nseveral signal and noise models for simulated data consisting of uncorrelated\nGaussian detector noise plus a superposition of sinusoidal signals from an\nastrophysical population of gravitational-wave sources. For simplicity, we\nconsider co-located and co-aligned detectors with white detector noise, but the\nmethod can be extended to more realistic detector configurations and power\nspectra. The general trend we observe is that a deterministic model is favored\nfor small source numbers, a non-Gaussian stochastic model is preferred for\nintermediate source numbers, and a Gaussian stochastic model is preferred for\nlarge source numbers. However, there is very large variation between individual\nsignal realizations, leading to fuzzy boundaries between the three regimes.

Previous studies of this type\ntreated the NS core as a normal fluid and thus did not account for its expected\nsuperfluidity. The source of buoyancy that supports the g modes is\nfundamentally different in the two cases: in a normal fluid core the buoyancy\nis due to gradients in the proton-to-neutron fraction whereas in a superfluid\ncore it is due to gradients in the muon-to-electron fraction. The latter yields\na stronger stratification and a superfluid NS therefore has a denser spectrum\nof g modes with frequencies above 10 Hz. As a result, many more g modes undergo\nresonant tidal excitation as the binary sweeps through the bandwidth of GW\ndetectors such as LIGO. We find that roughly 10 times more orbital energy is\ntransferred into g mode oscillations if the NS has a superfluid core rather\nthan a normal fluid core. However, because this energy is transferred later in\nthe inspiral when the orbital decay is faster, the accumulated phase error in\nthe gravitational waveform is comparable for a superfluid and a normal fluid NS\n(about 0.001-0.01 rad). A phase error of this magnitude is too small to be\nmeasured from a single event with the current generation of GW detectors. \n\n"}

The extreme sensitivity required to make such detections is\nachieved through exquisite isolation of all sensitive components of LIGO from\nnon-gravitational-wave disturbances. Nonetheless, LIGO is still susceptible to\na variety of instrumental and environmental sources of noise that contaminate\nthe data. Of particular concern are noise features known as glitches, which are\ntransient and non-Gaussian in their nature, and occur at a high enough rate so\nthat accidental coincidence between the two LIGO detectors is non-negligible.\nIn this paper we describe an innovative project that combines crowdsourcing\nwith machine learning to aid in the challenging task of categorizing all of the\nglitches recorded by the LIGO detectors. Through the Zooniverse platform, we\nengage and recruit volunteers from the public to categorize images of glitches\ninto pre-identified morphological classes and to discover new classes that\nappear as the detectors evolve.

It was shown recently that for gyros\nattached to static observers, their precession frequency became arbitrarily\nlarge in the limit of approach to the ergosurface. For gyros attached to\nstationary observers that move with non-zero angular velocity $\\Omega$, this\ndivergence at the ergosurface can be avoided. Specifically, for such gyros, the\nprecession frequencies diverge on the event horizon of a BH, but are finite and\nregular for NS everywhere except at the singularity itself. Therefore a genuine\ndetection of the event horizon becomes possible in this case. We also show that\nfor a near-extremal NS ($1<a_* < 1.1$), characteristic features appear in the\nradial profiles of the precession frequency, using which we can further\ndistinguish a near-extremal NS from a BH, or even from NS with larger angular\nmomentum. We then investigate the Lense-Thirring (LT) precession or nodal plane\nprecession frequency of the accretion disk around a BH and NS to show that\nclear distinctions exist for these configurations in terms of radial variation\nfeatures. The LT precession in equatorial circular orbits increases with\napproach to a BH, whereas for NS it increases, attains a peak and then\ndecreases. Interestingly, for $a_*=1.089$, it decreases until it vanishes at a\ncertain radius, and acquires negative values for $a_* > 1.089$ for a certain\nrange of $r$. For $1<a_*<1.089$, a peak appears, but the LT frequency remains\npositive definite. There are important differences in accretion disk LT\nfrequencies for BH and NS and since LT frequencies are intimately related to\nobserved QPOs, these features might allow us to determine whether a given\nrotating compact astrophysical object is BH or NS. \n\n"}

Recently, however, the hypothesis that the BH\ninterior does not exist has been gaining traction, as it provides a means for\nresolving the BH information-loss problem. Here, we propose a simple method for\nanswering the following question: Does the BH interior exist and, if so, does\nit contain some distribution of matter or is it mostly empty? Our proposal is\npremised on the idea that, similar to the case of relativistic, ultra-compact\nstars, any BH-like object whose interior has some matter distribution should\nsupport fluid modes in addition to the conventional spacetime modes. In\nparticular, the Coriolis-induced Rossby (r-) modes, whose spectrum is mostly\ninsensitive to the composition of the interior matter, should be a universal\nfeature of such BH-like objects. In fact, the frequency and damping time of\nthese modes are determined by only the object's mass and speed of rotation. The\nr-modes oscillate at a lower frequency, decay at a slower rate and produce\nweaker GWs than do modes of the spacetime class. Hence, they imprint a\nmodel-insensitive signature of a non-empty interior in the GW spectrum\nresulting from a BH merger.

A partial answer to\nthis intriguing question was recently provided by the 'no-short hair' theorem\nwhich asserts that the external fields of a spherically-symmetric electrically\nneutral hairy black-hole configuration must extend beyond the null circular\ngeodesic which characterizes the corresponding black-hole spacetime. One\nnaturally wonders whether the no-short hair inequality\n$r_{\\text{hair}}>r_{\\text{null}}$ is a generic property of all electrically\nneutral hairy black-hole spacetimes? In this paper we provide evidence that the\nanswer to this interesting question may be positive. In particular, we prove\nthat the recently discovered cloudy Kerr black-hole spacetimes --\nnon-spherically symmetric non-static black holes which support linearized\nmassive scalar fields in their exterior regions -- also respect this no-short\nhair lower bound.

Numerical simulations are a valuable tool for\nstudying the accretion-disk--magnetosphere interaction that is central to these\nproblems, most clearly for the recently discovered transitional millisecond\npulsars. However, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) methods, widely used for simulating\naccretion, have difficulty in highly magnetized stellar magnetospheres, while\nforce-free methods, suitable for such regions, cannot include the accreting\ngas. We present an MHD method that can stably evolve essentially force-free,\nhighly magnetized regions, and describe the first time-dependent relativistic\nsimulations of magnetized accretion onto millisecond pulsars. Our axisymmetric\ngeneral-relativistic MHD simulations for the first time demonstrate how the\ninteraction of a turbulent accretion flow with a pulsar's electromagnetic wind\ncan lead to the transition of an isolated pulsar to the accreting state.

However, evolving the full Boltzmann\nequations of radiative transport is extremely expensive.

Abstract: Cygnus X-3 is a unique microquasar in the Galaxy hosting a Wolf-Rayet\ncompanion orbiting a compact object that most likely is a low-mass black hole.\nThe unique source properties are likely due to the interaction of the compact\nobject with the heavy stellar wind of the companion. In this paper, we\nconcentrate on a very specific period of time prior to the massive outbursts\nobserved from the source. During this period, Cygnus X-3 is in a so-called\nhypersoft state, where the radio and hard X-ray fluxes are found to be at their\nlowest values (or non-detected), the soft X-ray flux is at its highest values,\nand sporadic gamma-ray emission is observed. We will utilize multiwavelength\nobservations in order to study the nature of the hypersoft state. We observed\nCygnus X-3 during the hypersoft state with Swift and NuSTAR in the X-rays and\nSMA, AMI-LA, and RATAN-600 in the radio.

In\nthis model, a supramassive neutron star supported by rapid rotation, will\ncollapse to a black hole several thousand to million years after its birth as a\nresult of spin down. The collapse violently snaps the magnetic-field lines\nanchored on the stellar surface, thus producing an electromagnetic pulse that\nwill propagate outwards and accelerate electrons producing a massive radio\nburst, i.e. a \"blitzar\". We present a systematic study of the gravitational\ncollapse of rotating and magnetised neutron stars with special attention to\nfar-field evolution at late times after the collapse. By considering a series\nof neutron stars with rotation ranging from zero to millisecond periods and\ndifferent magnetic-field strengths, we show that the blitzar emission is very\nrobust and always characterised by a series sub-millisecond pulses decaying\nexponentially in amplitude. The luminosity and energy released when the\nmagnetosphere is destroyed are well reproduced by a simple expression in terms\nof the stellar magnetic field and radius. Finally, we assess the occurrence of\npair production during a blitzar scenario, concluding that for typical\nmagnetic-field strengths of $10^{12}\\,{\\rm G}$ and spin frequencies of a few\nHz, pair production is suppressed. Overall, the very good match between the\nresults of the simulations and the luminosities normally observed for FRBs\nlends credibility to the blitzar model as a simple and yet plausible\nexplanation for the phenomenology of non-repeating FRBs. \n\n"}

J-PLUS sources exhibit two\ndistinct populations in the r-band magnitude vs. concentration plane,\ncorresponding to compact and extended sources. We modelled the two-population\ndistribution with a skewed Gaussian for compact objects and a log-normal\nfunction for the extended ones. The derived model and the number density prior\nbased on J-PLUS EDR data were used to estimate the Bayesian probability of a\nsource to be star or galaxy. This procedure was applied pointing-by-pointing to\naccount for varying observing conditions and sky position. Finally, we combined\nthe morphological information from g, r, and i broad bands in order to improve\nthe classification of low signal-to-noise sources.

This quantity, the effective spin\n$\\chi_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, is conserved up to at least the second post-Newtonian\norder.

An unstable normal\nmode of a differentially rotating star is detected by solving an eigenvalue\nproblem along the equatorial plane of the star. The physical mechanism of low\nT/W dynamical instabilities is also qualitatively confirmed by a scattering of\nsound waves between corotation and the surface caused by the corotation\nbarrier. Therefore, we can draw a picture of existing pulsation modes\nunstabilized due to an amplified reflection of sound waves from the corotation\nbarrier. The feature in the eigenfrequency and eigenfunction of the unstable\nmode in the linear analysis roughly agrees with that in the three-dimensional\nhydrodynamical simulation in Newtonian gravity. Moreover, the nature of the\neigenfunction that oscillates between corotation and the surface for an\nunstable star requires reinterpretation of pulsation modes in differentially\nrotating stars.

However, most existing treatments of this background beyond GR\noverlook modifications to the energy carried by gravitational waves, or rely on\nGR assumptions that are invalid in other theories. This may lead to\nmistranslation between the observable cross-correlation of detector outputs and\ngravitational-wave energy density, and thus to errors when deriving\nobservational constraints on theories. In this article, we lay out a generic\nformalism for stochastic gravitational- wave searches, applicable to a large\nfamily of theories beyond GR.

Using standard ideas from quantum information theory, it\nwas shown by Bekenstein that, in principle, the filtered Hawking radiation\nemitted by a (3+1)-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole may carry with it a\nsubstantial amount of information, the information which was suspected to be\nlost. It is of physical interest to test the general validity of the\n\"information leak\" scenario suggested by Bekenstein as a possible resolution to\nthe Hawking information puzzle. In the present paper we analyze the\nsemi-classical entropy emission properties of higher-dimensional black holes.\nIn particular, we provide evidence that the characteristic Hawking quanta of\n$(D+1)$-dimensional Schwarzschild black holes in the large $D\\gg1$ regime are\nalmost unaffected by the spacetime curvature outside the black-hole horizon.\nThis fact implies that, in the large-$D$ regime, the Hawking black-hole\nradiation spectra are almost purely thermal, thus suggesting that the emitted\nquanta cannot carry the amount of information which is required in order to\nresolve the information paradox. Our analysis therefore suggests that the\nelegant information leak scenario suggested by Bekenstein cannot provide a\ngeneric resolution to the intriguing Hawking information paradox. \n\n"}

The goal\nwould be to obtain a high enough density of sources to probe the\nthree-dimensional density field on the scale of the BAO feature. A\npercent-level measurement in this redshift range can almost double the Dark\nEnergy Task Force Figure of Merit, relative to the case with only a similar\nprecision measurement at z~1, if the Universe is not assumed to be flat. This\nimprovement is greater than the one obtained by doubling the size of the z~1\nsurvey, with Planck and a weak SDSS-like z=0.3 BAO measurement assumed in each\ncase. Galaxy BAO surveys at z~1 may be able to make an effective LyaF\nmeasurement simultaneously at minimal added cost, because the required number\ndensity of quasars is relatively small. We discuss the constraining power as a\nfunction of area, magnitude limit (density of quasars), resolution, and\nsignal-to-noise of the spectra. For example, a survey covering 2000 sq. deg.\nand achieving S/N=1.8 per Ang. at g=23 (~40 quasars per sq. deg.) with an\nR~>250 spectrograph is sufficient to measure both the radial and transverse\noscillation scales to 1.4% from the LyaF (or better, if fainter magnitudes and\npossibly Lyman-break galaxies can be used). At fixed integration time and in\nthe sky-noise-dominated limit, a wider, noisier survey is generally more\nefficient; the only fundamental upper limit on noise being the need to identify\na quasar and find a redshift. Because the LyaF is much closer to linear and\ngenerally better understood than galaxies, systematic errors are even less\nlikely to be a problem. \n\n"}

The relevant\nHamiltonian perturbation, describing the interaction of the meson with the foam\nmedium, consists of off-diagonal stochastic metric fluctuations, connecting\ndistinct mass eigenstates (or the appropriate generalisation thereof in the\ncase of K-mesons), and it is proportional to the relevant momentum transfer\n(along the direction of motion of the meson pair). There are two kinds of\nCPT-violating effects in this case, which can be experimentally disentangled:\none (termed ``omega-effect'') is associated with the failure of the\nindistinguishability between the neutral meson and its antiparticle, and\naffects certain symmetry properties of the initial state of the two-meson\nsystem; the second effect is generated by the time evolution of the system in\nthe medium of the space-time foam, and can result in time-dependent\ncontributions of the $omega-effect type in the time profile of the two meson\nstate.
