Although the evidence for this claim is\nweak, many have accepted it. This claim has implications for how to present\natoms in classes ranging from elementary school to graduate school. We present\nresults from a study designed to test this claim by developing a curriculum on\nmodels of the atom, including the Bohr and Schrodinger models. We examine\nstudent descriptions of atoms on final exams in transformed modern physics\nclasses using various versions of this curriculum. We find that if the\ncurriculum does not include sufficient connections between different models,\nmany students still have a Bohr-like view of atoms, rather than a more accurate\nSchrodinger model. However, with an improved curriculum designed to develop\nmodel-building skills and with better integration between different models, it\nis possible to get most students to describe atoms using the Schrodinger model.\nIn comparing our results with previous research, we find that comparing and\ncontrasting different models is a key feature of a curriculum that helps\nstudents move beyond the Bohr model and adopt Schrodinger's view of the atom.\nWe find that understanding the reasons for the development of models is much\nmore difficult for students than understanding the features of the models.

Its contradictions were caused not by the orbit concept but by a mental\nbarrier--the inconceivability that an electron might collide with the atomic\nnucleus. Removing that barrier resolves the theory's main failures--incorrect\norbital momenta, He atom, H2+ molecule ion. The inclusion of electron\noscillations through the nucleus--a concept called \"Coulomb\noscillator\"--renders the old quantum theory consistent with quantum mechanics\n(although devoid of wave character). The triple success of the Bohr-Sommerfeld\nmodel is its correct description of the H atom (and one-electron ions)\nconcerning (1) the energy levels Enl, (2) the orbital angular momenta Lnl--if\ncorrected as Lnl^2 = l(l+1) hbar^2 and with the Coulomb oscillator\nincluded--and (3) the orbits' space quantization--with (Lnl)z = ml hbar. These\nachievements are succinctly represented by the principal, angular and magnetic\nquantum numbers (n, l, ml) and visualized by orbital ellipse geometry--major\naxis, vertex curvature, and tilt angle, respectively. Orbit geometry also\naccounts for the average orbit size. Moreover, the Coulomb oscillator provides\na natural explanation of (isotropic) hyperfine interaction. The shortcomings of\nthe old quantum theory lie in its neglect of three properties of\nparticles--their spin, their wave nature and their quantum statistics.

Different analysis methods have been proposed for this purpose, but so\nfar, no comparative test has been performed to test their validity. We\ncalculated model spectra of disk models with different geometries and central\nsources, using a 2D radiative transfer code. These spectra were then fitted in\na blind test using four different spectral decomposition methods. We studied\nthe effect of disk structure (flared vs. flat), inclination angle, size of the\ninner disk hole and stellar luminosity on the fitted chemical composition. Our\nresults show that the derived dust compositions by all methods deviate\nsystematically from the real chemical composition. Out of the four tested\nspectral decomposition methods, our new two-layer temperature distribution\nmethod, differs the least from the input dust composition and the results show\nthe weakest systematic effects. The reason for the deviations of the results\ngiven by other methods lies in their simplifying assumptions (e.g. single\naverage grain temperature or one component continuum).

While HI-deficiency by itself is not a\nsufficient condition for molecular gas depletion, we find that H2 reduction is\nassociated with the removal of HI inside the galaxy optical disk. Those\nHI-deficient galaxies with normal H2 content have lost HI mainly from outside\ntheir optical disks, where the H2 content is low in all galaxies. This finding\nis consistent with theoretical models in which the molecular fraction in a\ngalaxy is determined primarily by its gas column density.

Meteoritic and cometary material contain\nabundant evidence for the presence of a rich and active chemistry in the\nplanet-forming zone during the gas-rich phase of Solar System formation. It is\na natural conjecture that analogs can be found amoung the zoo of protoplanetary\ndisks around nearby young stars. The study of the chemistry and dynamics of\nplanet formation requires: 1) tracers of dense gas at 100-1000 K and 2) imaging\ncapabilities of such tracers with 5-100 (0.5-20 AU) milli-arcsec resolution,\ncorresponding to the planet-forming zone at the distance of the closest\nstar-forming regions. Recognizing that the rich infrared (2-200 micron)\nmolecular spectrum recently discovered to be common in protoplanetary disks\nrepresents such a tracer, we present a new general raytracing code, RADLite,\nthat is optimized for producing infrared line spectra and images from\naxisymmetric structures. RADLite can consistently deal with a wide range of\nvelocity gradients, such as those typical for the inner regions of\nprotoplanetary disks. The code is intended as a backend for chemical and\nexcitation codes, and can rapidly produce spectra of thousands of lines for\ngrids of models for comparison with observations.

We consider contributions to the background\nfrom diffuse synchrotron emission from clusters and the intergalactic medium,\npreviously unrecognized flux from low surface brightness regions of radio\nsources, and faint point sources below the flux limit of existing surveys. By\nexamining radio source counts available in the literature, we conclude that\nmost of the radio background is produced by radio point sources that dominate\nat sub microJy fluxes. We show that a truly diffuse background produced by\nelectrons far from galaxes is ruled out because such energetic electrons would\noverproduce the obserevd X-ray/gamma-ray background through inverse Compton\nscattering of the other photon fields.

Our goal is to figure out which of three giant\nplanet formation mechanisms--core accretion (with or without migration),\nscattering from the inner disk, or gravitational instability--could be\nresponsible for Fomalhaut b, HR 8799 b, c and d, and similar planets discovered\nin the future. This paper presents the results of numerical experiments\ncomparing the long-period planet formation efficiency of each possible\nmechanism in model A star, G star and M star disks.\n  First, a simple core accretion simulation shows that planet cores forming\nbeyond 35 AU cannot reach critical mass, even under the most favorable\nconditions one can construct. Second, a set of N-body simulations demonstrates\nthat planet-planet scattering does not create stable, wide-orbit systems such\nas HR 8799. Finally, a linear stability analysis verifies previous work showing\nthat global spiral instabilities naturally arise in high-mass disks. We\nconclude that massive gas giants on stable orbits with semimajor axes greater\nthan 35 AU form by gravitational instability in the disk. We recommend that\nobservers examine the planet detection rate as a function of stellar age,\ncontrolling for planet dimming with time. If planet detection rate is found to\nbe independent of stellar age, it would confirm our prediction that\ngravitational instability is the dominant mode of producing detectable planets\non wide orbits.

In contrast to the other planets,\nits measured brightness temperature of 2170+-55 K is significantly higher than\nits maximum hemisphere-averaged effective day-side temperature. However, it is\nnot expected that a hot Jupiter radiates as a black body, and its thermal\nspectrum can deviate significantly from a Planck curve. We present models of\nthe planet/star flux ratio as function of wavelength, which are calculated for\na T/P profile in radiative and hydrostatic equilibrium, using a self-consistent\natmosphere code. These are compared with the CoRoT detection, and with\nmeasurements at 4.5 and 8 um from the Spitzer Space Telescope from Gillon et\nal. (2009). We estimate that reflected light contributes only at a 10-20% level\nto the total optical eclipse depth. The models allow for an 'extra absorber' to\nbe inserted at high altitude in the planet's atmosphere. This produces a\nthermal inversion layer, recently invoked to explain the photometric reversals\nand flux enhancements seen in some planets in the infrared. In the 0.5-1.5 um\nwavelength range, the model-spectra of planets with an extra absorber at high\naltitude, are relatively suppressed in flux compared to those without such\nabsorber.

Previous results show a high level of stellar activity, with\nthe presence of prominence-like structures, spots on the surface and strong\nflare events, despite the moderate rotational velocity of the star. In\naddition, radial velocity variations with a semi-amplitude of up to 1 km/s were\ndetected. We investigated the nature of these radial velocity variations, in\norder to determine whether they are due to stellar activity or the reflex\nmotion of the star induced by a companion. We have analysed high-resolution\nechelle spectra and also two-band photometry was obtained to produce the light\ncurve and determine the photometric period. Based upon the analysis of the\nbisector velocity span, as well as spectroscopic indices of chromospheric\nindicators and taking into account the photometric analysis, we report that the\nbest explanation for the RV variation is the presence of a sub-stellar\ncompanion. The Keplerian fit of the RV data yields a solution for a close-in\nmassive planet with an orbital period of 7.78 days. The presence of the\nclose-in massive planet could also be an interpretation for the high level of\nstellar activity detected.

The observed flux\ndepends on supernova physics, but also on the cosmic history of supernova\nexplosions; currently, the cosmic supernova rate introduces a substantial\n(+/-40%) uncertainty, largely through its absolute normalization. However, a\nnew class of wide-field, repeated-scan (synoptic) optical sky surveys is coming\nonline, and will map the sky in the time domain with unprecedented depth,\ncompleteness, and dynamic range. We show that these surveys will obtain the\ncosmic supernova rate by direct counting, in an unbiased way and with high\nstatistics, and thus will allow for precise predictions of the DSNB.

We lay out a\nmethod for deriving and testing equations of state, and deduce mass-radius and\nmass-pressure relations for key materials whose equation of state is reasonably\nwell established, and for differentiated Fe/rock.

For nebula parameters that satisfy observed mass\naccretion rates of Myr-old protoplanetary nebulae, the scenario is roughly\nconsistent with not only the \"fossil\" sizes of the asteroids, and their\nestimated production rates, but also with the observed spread in formation ages\nof chondrules in a given chondrite, and with a tolerably small radial diffusive\nmixing during this time between formation and accretion (the model naturally\nhelps explain the peculiar size distribution of chondrules within such\nobjects). The scenario also produces 10-100km diameter primary KBOs. The\noptimum range of parameters, however, represents a higher gas density and\nfractional abundance of solids, and a smaller difference between keplerian and\npressure-supported orbital velocities, than \"canonical\" models of the solar\nnebula. We discuss several potential explanations for these differences. \n\n"}

In this work we assess the range of separations at which\nthe CI may operate by (1) allowing for arbitrary (physically meaningful) rate\nof planetesimal accretion by the core and (2) properly taking into account the\ndependence of the critical mass for the CI on the planetesimal accretion\nluminosity.

This paper tests this\napproximation using high resolution 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH)\nsimulations of self-gravitating protostellar discs with radiative transfer. The\nnature of angular momentum transport associated with the gravitational\ninstability is characterised as a function of both the stellar mass and the\ndisc-to-star mass ratio. The effective viscosity is calculated from the\nReynolds and gravitational stresses in the disc. This is then compared to what\nwould be expected if the effective viscosity were determined by assuming local\nthermodynamic equilibrium or, equivalently, that the local dissipation rate\nmatches the local cooling rate. In general, all the discs considered here\nsettle into a self-regulated state where the heating generated by the\ngravitational instability is modulated by the local radiative cooling. It is\nfound that low-mass discs can indeed be represented by a local\n\"alpha-parametrisation\", provided that the disc aspect ratio is small (H/R <\n0.1) which is generally the case when the disc-to-star mass ratio q <0.5.\nHowever, this result does not extend to discs with masses approaching that of\nthe central object.

Unfortunately, there are\nmany outstanding uncertainties associated with these \"virial\" mass estimates.\nOne of these comes from using the accretion luminosity to infer a size for the\nbroad-line region. Incorporating the new sample of low-luminosity active\ngalaxies from our recent monitoring campaign at Lick Observatory, we\nrecalibrate the radius-luminosity relation with tracers of the accretion\nluminosity other than the optical continuum. We find that the radius of the\nbroad-line region scales as the square root of the X-ray and Hbeta\nluminosities, in agreement with recent optical studies. On the other hand, the\nscaling appears to be marginally steeper with narrow-line luminosities. This is\nconsistent with a previously observed decrease in the ratio of narrow-line to\nX-ray luminosity with increasing total luminosity.

Current models suggest that this is the first transiting\nrocky planet found outside the solar system. Given that the planet orbits a\nsolar-like star at a distance of on ly 4.5 R*, it is expected that material\nreleased from its surface may then form an exosphere. AIMS: We constrai n the\nproperties of the exosphere by observing the planet in- and out-of-transit.\nDetecting of the exosphere of CoRoT-7b would for the first time allow to study\nthe material originating in the surface of a rocky extrasolar planet. We scan\nthe entire optical spectrum for any lines originating from the planet, focusing\nparticularly on spectral lines such as those detected in Mercury, and Io in our\nsolar system. METHODS: Since lines originating in the exosphere are expected to\nbe narrow, we observed CoRoT-7b at high resolution with UVES on the VLT. By\nsubtracting the two spectra from each other, we search for emission and\nabsorption lines originating in the exosph ere of CoRoT-7b.

Since the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the spectra is as high as\n300, we derive firm upper limits for the flux-range between 1.6E-18 and 3.2E-18\nWm**-2. For CaO, we find an upper limit of E-17 Wm**-2. We also search for\nemission lines originating in the plasma torus fed by volcanic activity and\nderive upper limits for these lines.

In this study, we explore the\ndegeneracies between thermal inversions and molecular abundances in four highly\nirradiated hot Jupiter atmospheres, day-side observations of which were\npreviously reported to be consistent with thermal inversions based on Spitzer\nphotometry. The four systems are: HD 209458b, HAT-P-7b, TrES-4, and TrES-2. For\neach system, we explore the model parameter space with ~ 10^6 models using a\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo routine.

We compare the\nmagnification pattern of the triple lens system with that of a best-fitted\nbinary system composed of a star and a Jovian mass planet, and check the\nprobability in detecting the low-mass secondary planet whose signature will be\nsuperposed on that of the primary Jovian mass planet. Detection probabilities\nof the low-mass planet in the triple lens system are quite similar to the\nprobability in detecting such a low-mass planet in a binary system with a star\nand only a low-mass planet, which shows that the signature of a low-mass planet\ncan be effectively detected even when it is concurrent with the signature of\nthe more massive planet, implying that the binary superposition approximation\nworks over a relatively broad range of planet mass ratio and separations, and\nthe inaccuracies thereof do not significantly affect the detection probability\nof the lower mass secondary planet. Since the signature of the Jovian mass\nplanet will be larger and lasts longer, thereby warranting more intensive\nfollow-up observations, the actual detection rate of the low-mass planet in a\ntriple system with a Jovian mass can be significantly higher than that in a\nbinary system with a low-mass planet only.

Abstract: The radial velocity (RV) method for detecting extrasolar planets has been the\nmost successful to date. The RV signal imprinted by a few Earth-mass planet\naround a cool star is at the limit of the typical single measurement\nuncertainty obtained using state-of-the-art spectrographs. This requires\nrelying on statistics in order to unearth signals buried below noise. Artifacts\nintroduced by observing cadences can produce spurious signals or mask genuine\nplanets that should be easily detected otherwise. Here we discuss a\nparticularly confusing statistical degeneracy resulting from the yearly\naliasing of the first eccentric harmonic of an already-detected planet. This\nproblem came sharply into focus after the recent announcement of the detection\nof a 3.1 Earth mass planet candidate in the habitable zone of the nearby low\nmass star GJ 581. The orbital period of the new candidate planet (GJ 581g)\ncorresponds to an alias of the first eccentric harmonic of a previously\nreported planet, GJ 581d. Although the star is stable, the combination of the\nobserving cadence and the presence of multiple planets can cause period\nmisinterpretations. In this work, we determine whether the detection of GJ 581g\nis justified given this degeneracy. We also discuss the implications of our\nanalysis for the recent Bayesian studies of the same data set, which failed to\nconfirm the existence of the new planet. Performing a number of statistical\ntests, we show that, despite some caveats, the existence of GJ 581g remains the\nmost likely orbital solution to the currently available RV data. \n\n"}

Slowed down in the\nterrestrial matter, OHe is elusive for direct methods of underground Dark\nmatter detection using its nuclear recoil. However, low energy binding of OHe\nwith sodium nuclei can lead to annual variations of energy release from OHe\nradiative capture in the interval of energy 2-4 keV in DAMA/NaI and DAMA/LIBRA\nexperiments. At nuclear parameters, reproducing DAMA results, the energy\nrelease predicted for detectors with chemical content other than NaI differ in\nthe most cases from the one in DAMA detector.

Our model reproduces the Solar\nSystem's complement of observed irregulars well, and suggests that the\ncompetition between grain-grain collisions and Poynting-Robertson (PR) drag\nhelps set the fate of the dust. Because swarm collision rates decrease over\ntime the main dust sink can change with time, and may help unravel the\naccretion history of synchronously rotating regular satellites that show\nbrightness asymmetries. Some level of dust must be present on AU scales around\nthe Solar System's giant planets, which we predict may be at detectable levels.\nWe also predict whether dust produced by extrasolar circumplanetary swarms can\nbe detected. The coronagraphic instruments on JWST will have the ability to\ndetect the dust generated by these swarms, which are most detectable around\nplanets that orbit at tens of AU from the youngest stars.

The processes by which gravitational\nenergy is converted into turbulent and magnetic energies, however, remain\npoorly understood. Here, we show with high-resolution, adaptive-mesh\nsimulations that MHD turbulence is efficiently driven by extracting energy from\nthe gravitational potential during the collapse of a dense gas cloud.\nCompressible motions generated during the contraction are converted into\nsolenoidal, turbulent motions, leading to a natural energy ratio of E_sol/E_tot\nof approximately 2/3. We find that the energy injection scale of gravity-driven\nturbulence is close to the local Jeans scale. If small seeds of the magnetic\nfield are present, they are amplified exponentially fast via the small-scale\ndynamo process. The magnetic field grows most efficiently on the smallest\nscales, for which the stretching, twisting, and folding of field lines, and the\nturbulent vortices are sufficiently resolved. We find that this scale\ncorresponds to about 30 grid cells in the simulations. We thus suggest a new\nminimum resolution criterion of 30 cells per Jeans length in\n(magneto)hydrodynamical simulations of self-gravitating gas, in order to\nresolve turbulence on the Jeans scale, and to capture minimum dynamo\namplification of the magnetic field. Due to numerical diffusion, however, any\nexisting simulation today can at best provide lower limits on the physical\ngrowth rates. We conclude that a small, initial magnetic field can grow to\ndynamically important strength on time scales significantly shorter than the\nfree-fall time of the cloud. \n\n"}

We have obtained a high-quality spectrum with full UV-NIR wavelength\ncoverage of galaxy NMBS-C7447 using X-Shooter on the VLT. We determined a\nvelocity dispersion of 294 +- 51 km/s. Given this velocity dispersion and the\neffective radius of 1.64 +- 0.15 kpc (as determined from HST-WFC3 F160W\nobservations) we derive a dynamical mass of 1.7 +- 0.5 x 10^11 Msun.

This simple model provides an accurate\ndescription of the extractable amount of uranium for the recent mining\noperations.\n  Using this model for all larger existing and planned uranium mines up to\n2030, a global uranium mining peak of at most 58 +- 4 ktons around the year\n2015 is obtained. Thereafter we predict that uranium mine production will\ndecline to at most 54 +- 5 ktons by 2025 and, with the decline steepening, to\nat most 41 +- 5 ktons around 2030. This amount will not be sufficient to fuel\nthe existing and planned nuclear power plants during the next 10-20 years. In\nfact, we find that it will be difficult to avoid supply shortages even under a\nslow 1%/year worldwide nuclear energy phase-out scenario up to 2025.

Transient\nphenomena are likely locations of explosive or dynamic events and they offer\ntremendous potential to uncover new physics and astrophysics. A number of\nupcoming next-generation radio facilities and recent advances in computing and\ninstrumentation have provided a much needed impetus for this field which has\nremained a relatively uncharted territory for the past several decades. In this\npaper we focus mainly on the class of phenomena that occur on very short time\nscales (i.e. from $\\sim$ milliseconds to $\\sim$ nanoseconds), known as {\\it\nfast transients}, the detections of which involve considerable signal\nprocessing and data management challenges, given the high time and frequency\nresolutions required in their explorations, the role of propagation effects to\nbe considered and a multitude of deleterious effects due to radio frequency\ninterference.

Diffusive effects are included. The main motivation is\nfrom convection in planetary interiors, where thermal winds are expected due to\ntemperature variations on the core-mantle boundary. The system admits both\nconvective instability and baroclinic instability. We find a smooth transition\nbetween the two types of modes, and investigate where the transition region\nbetween the two types of instability occurs in parameter space. The thermal\nwind helps to destabilise the convective modes. Baroclinic instability can\noccur when the applied vertical temperature gradient is stable, and the\ncritical Rayleigh number is then negative. Long wavelength modes are the first\nto become unstable. Asymptotic analysis is possible for the transition region\nand also for long wavelength instabilities, and the results agree well with our\nnumerical solutions. We also investigate how the instabilities in this system\nrelate to the classical baroclinic instability in the Eady problem.

This\nindicates that the star-forming disk has been shrinking. In addition, the\nradial distributions of the stellar mass surface density are well described as\npiece-wise exponential profiles, and \\sim 80% of the galaxies have steeper mass\nprofiles in the outer disk than in the inner region. The steep radial decline\nof SF rate in the outer parts compared to that in the inner disks gives a\nnatural explanation for the down-bending stellar mass surface density profiles.\nWithin the inner disks, our sample galaxies on average have constant ratios of\nrecent SF rate to stellar mass with radius.

The binary has a maximum separation of 1\narcsec with less than 0.1 mags difference between components with identical\nultra-red colors (g-i=1.49+-0.01 mags). The orbit of the mutual components was\nfound to have a period of 961.2+-4.6 days with a semi-major axis of 21000+-160\nkm and eccentricity of 0.1529+-0.0028. The inclination is 15.68+-0.22 degs and\nthe mirror orbit rejected at high confidence. The total system mass is\n7.90+-0.21 x 10^17 kg. Equal-sized, wide binaries and ultra-red colors are\ncommon in the low inclination \"cold\" classical part of the Kuiper Belt and\nlikely formed through some sort of three body interactions within a much denser\nKuiper Belt. To date 2007 TY430 is the only ultra-red, equal-sized binary known\noutside of the classical Kuiper belt. Numerical simulations suggest 2007 TY430\nis moderately unstable in the outer part of the 3:2 resonance and thus 2007\nTY430 is likely an escaped \"cold\" classical object that later got trapped in\nresonance. Similar to the known binaries in the cold classical population, 2007\nTY430 requires a high albedo and very low density to obtain the total mass\nfound.

The standard\nprocedures used to measure shapes involve smoothing and binning of data and\nthus may not be sufficient to detect structural properties like bars, which are\nusually subtle in low surface brightness systems. Taking advantage of the fact\nthat in nearby dwarfs photometry of individual stars is available we introduce\ndiscrete measures of shape based on the two-dimensional inertia tensor and the\nFourier bar mode. We apply these measures of shape first to a variety of\nsimulated dwarf galaxies formed via tidal stirring of disks embedded in dark\nmatter halos and orbiting the Milky Way. In addition to strong mass loss and\nrandomization of stellar orbits, the disks undergo morphological transformation\nthat typically involves the formation of a triaxial bar after the first\npericenter passage. These tidally induced bars persist for a few Gyr before\nbeing shortened towards a more spherical shape if the tidal force is strong\nenough.

In this study, we identify\nwhat can unambiguously be determined about the atmospheres of exoplanets from\ntheir transmission spectra by applying the retrieval method to synthetic\nobservations of the super-Earth GJ 1214b. Our approach to infer constraints on\natmospheric parameters is to compute their joint and marginal posterior\nprobability distributions using the MCMC technique in a parallel tempering\nscheme. A new atmospheric parameterization is introduced that is applicable to\ngeneral atmospheres in which the main constituent is not known a priori and\nclouds may be present. Our main finding is that a unique constraint of the\nmixing ratios of the absorbers and up to two spectrally inactive gases (such as\nN2 and primordial H2+He) is possible if the observations are sufficient to\nquantify both (1) the broadband transit depths in at least one absorption\nfeature for each absorber and (2) the slope and strength of the molecular\nRayleigh scattering signature.

The SW side of the disk\nis 50--100% brighter at $r$ = 35-80 AU, and the location of its peak brightness\nroughly coincides with the disk's mm emission peak. Spectral energy\ndistribution modeling suggests that HD 32297 has at least two dust populations\nthat may originate from two separate belts likely at different locations,\npossibly at distances coinciding with the surface brightness peaks. A disk\nmodel for a single dust belt including a phase function with two components and\na 5-10 AU pericenter offset explains the disk's warped structure and reproduces\nsome of the surface brightness profile's shape (e.g. the overall \"wavy\"\nprofile, the SB peak/plateau shifts) but more poorly reproduces the disk's\nbrightness asymmetry.

The MEarth Project is an ongoing\neffort to do so, as a ground-based photometric survey designed to detect\nexoplanets as small as 2 Earth radii transiting mid-to-late M dwarfs within 33\npc of the Sun. Unfortunately, identifying transits of such planets in\nphotometric monitoring is complicated both by the intrinsic stellar variability\nthat is common among these stars and by the nocturnal cadence, atmospheric\nvariations, and instrumental systematics that often plague Earth-bound\nobservatories. Here we summarize the properties of MEarth data gathered so far,\nand we present a new framework to detect shallow exoplanet transits in wiggly\nand irregularly-spaced light curves. In contrast to previous methods that clean\ntrends from light curves before searching for transits, this framework assesses\nthe significance of individual transits simultaneously while modeling\nvariability, systematics, and the photometric quality of individual nights. Our\nMethod for Including Starspots and Systematics in the Marginalized Probability\nof a Lone Eclipse (MISS MarPLE) uses a computationally efficient semi-Bayesian\napproach to explore the vast probability space spanned by the many parameters\nof this model, naturally incorporating the uncertainties in these parameters\ninto its evaluation of candidate events. We show how to combine individual\ntransits processed by MISS MarPLE into periodic transiting planet candidates\nand compare our results to the popular Box-fitting Least Squares (BLS) method\nwith simulations. By applying MISS MarPLE to observations from the MEarth\nProject, we demonstrate the utility of this framework for robustly assessing\nthe false alarm probability of transit signals in real data.

As a result, the conductiv- ity,\nproportional to the ionization fraction, gains a strong, positive dependence on\ntemperature.

This contrasts with the\nresistiv- ity increase expected in an ideal magnetic reconnection region.

This\nstudy is motivated by i) the potential to find bright warm disks around planet\nhost stars, ii) a need to characterise the distribution of rare warm disks, and\niii) the possible identification of candidates for discovering transiting dust\nconcentrations. We find about 8,000 stars that have excess emission, mostly at\n12um. The positions of these stars correlate with the 100um background level so\nmost of the flux measurements associated with these excesses are spurious. We\nidentify 271 stars with plausible excesses by making a 5MJy/sr cut in the IRAS\n100um emission. The number counts of these excesses, at both 12 and 22um, have\nthe same distribution as extra-Galactic number counts. Thus, although some\nexcesses may be circumstellar, most can be explained as chance alignments with\nbackground galaxies. The one exception is a 22um excess associated with a\nrelatively nearby A-type star that we were able to confirm because the disk\noccurrence rate is independent of stellar distance. Despite our low detection\nrate, these results place valuable upper limits on the distribution of large\nmid-infrared excesses; e.g. fewer than 1:1000 stars have 12um excesses (F_\nobs/F_star) larger than a factor of five. In contrast to previous studies, we\nfind no evidence for disks around 1790 stars with candidate planets (we\nattribute one significant 12um excess to a background galaxy), and no evidence\nthat the disk distribution around planet hosts is different to the bulk\npopulation. Higher resolution imaging of stars with excesses is the best way to\nrule out galaxy confusion and identify more reliable disk candidates among\nKepler stars.

Astrometric parameters are commonly derived by fitting them as\nparameters of a timing model to a series of pulse times of arrival (TOAs). TOAs\nmeasured to microsecond precision over several-year spans can yield position\nmeasurements with sub-milliarcsecond precision. However, timing-based\nastrometry can become biased if a pulsar displays any red spin noise, which can\nbe compared to the red noise signal produced by the stochastic gravitational\nwave background. We investigate how noise of different spectral types is\nabsorbed by timing models, leading to significant estimation errors in the\nastrometric parameters. We find that commonly used techniques for fitting\ntiming models in the presence of red noise (Cholesky whitening) prevent the\nabsorption of noise into the timing model remarkably well if the time baseline\nof observations exceeds several years, but are inadequate for dealing with\nshorter pulsar data sets. Independent of timing, pulsar-optimized very long\nbaseline interferometry (VLBI) is capable of providing position estimates\nprecise to the sub-milliarcsecond levels needed for high-precision timing. We\ncompute a necessary transformation between the International Celestial\nReference Frame and pulsar timing frames and quantitatively discuss how the\ntransformation will improve in coming years. We find that incorporating VLBI\nastrometry into the timing models of pulsars for which only a couple of years\nof timing data exist will lead to more realistic assessments of red spin noise\nand could enhance the amplitude of gravitational wave signatures in post-fit\ntiming residuals by factors of 20 or more. \n\n"}

We study effects produced by these hypothetical\ncometary projectiles on main-belt asteroids.

We selected 12 families which may be related to the LHB\naccording to their dynamical ages. We then used collisional models and N-body\norbital simulations to gain insight into the long-term dynamical evolution of\nsynthetic LHB families over 4 Gyr. We account for the mutual collisions, the\nphysical disruptions of comets, the Yarkovsky/YORP drift, chaotic diffusion, or\npossible perturbations by the giant-planet migration.\n  Assuming a \"standard\" size-frequency distribution of primordial comets, we\npredict the number of families with parent-body sizes D_PB >= 200 km which\nseems consistent with observations.

The\n  history of early-type and late-type dwarfs Abstract: How did the dwarf galaxy population of present-day galaxy clusters form and\ngrow over time? We address this question by analysing the history of dark\nmatter subhaloes in the Millennium-II cosmological simulation. A semi-analytic\nmodel serves as the link to observations. We argue that a reasonable analogue\nto early morphological types or red-sequence dwarf galaxies are those subhaloes\nthat experienced strong mass loss, or alternatively those that have spent a\nlong time in massive haloes. This approach reproduces well the observed\nmorphology-distance relation of dwarf galaxies in the Virgo and Coma clusters,\nand thus provides insight into their history. Over their lifetime, present-day\nlate types have experienced an amount of environmental influence similar to\nwhat the progenitors of dwarf ellipticals had already experienced at redshifts\nabove two. Therefore, dwarf ellipticals are more likely to be a result of early\nand continuous environmental influence in group- and cluster-size haloes,\nrather than a recent transformation product. The observed morphological\nsequences of late-type and early-type galaxies have developed in parallel, not\nconsecutively. Consequently, the characteristics of today's late-type galaxies\nare not necessarily representative for the progenitors of today's dwarf\nellipticals.

Most of these stars are fainter than 14th magnitude, in\ncontrast to other spectroscopic follow-up studies. This sample includes many\nhigh-priority Earth-sized candidate planets. A set of model spectra are fitted\nto R~3000 optical spectra of 268 stars to improve estimates of Teff, log(g),\nand [Fe/H] for the dwarfs in the range 4750K<Teff<7200K. These stellar\nproperties are used to find new stellar radii and, in turn, new radius\nestimates for the candidate planets. The result of improved stellar\ncharacteristics is a more accurate representation of this Kepler exoplanet\nsample and identification of promising candidates for more detailed study. This\nstellar sample, particularly among stars with Teff>5200K, includes a greater\nnumber of relatively evolved stars with larger radii than assumed by the\nmission on the basis of multi-color broadband photometry. About 26% of the\nmodelled stars require radii to be revised upwards by a factor of 1.35 or\ngreater, and modelling of 87% of the stars suggest some increase in radius. The\nsample presented here also exhibits a change in the incidence of planets larger\nthan 3-4 Earth radii as a function of metallicity.

This is largely related to\ntwo phenomena: a dust-extinction bias, that prevented high-mass and thus likely\nhigh-metallicity GRB hosts to be detected in the first place, and a lack of\nefficient instrumentation, that limited spectroscopic studies including\nmetallicity measurements to the low-redshift end of the GRB host population.\nThe subject of this work is the very energetic GRB 110918A, for which we\nmeasure a redshift of z=0.984. GRB 110918A gave rise to a luminous afterglow\nwith an intrinsic spectral slope of b=0.70, which probed a sight-line with\nlittle extinction (A_V=0.16 mag) typical of the established distributions of\nafterglow properties. Photometric and spectroscopic follow-up observations of\nthe galaxy hosting GRB 110918A, including optical/NIR photometry with GROND and\nspectroscopy with VLT/X-shooter, however, reveal an all but average GRB host in\ncomparison to the z~1 galaxies selected through similar afterglows to date. It\nhas a large spatial extent with a half-light radius of ~10 kpc, the highest\nstellar mass for z<1.9 (log(M_*/M_sol) = 10.68+-0.16), and an Halpha-based star\nformation rate of 41 M_sol/yr.

Abstract: (abridged) Infrared excesses associated with debris disk host stars detected\nso far peak at wavelengths around ~100{\\mu}m or shorter. However, six out of 31\nexcess sources in the Herschel OTKP DUNES have been seen to show significant -\nand in some cases extended - excess emission at 160{\\mu}m, which is larger than\nthe 100{\\mu}m excess. This excess emission has been suggested to stem from\ndebris disks colder than those known previously. Using several methods, we\nre-consider whether some or even all of the candidates may be associated with\nunrelated galactic or extragalactic emission and conclude that it is highly\nunlikely that none of the candidates represents a true circumstellar disk. For\ntrue disks, both the dust temperatures inferred from the SEDs and the disk\nradii estimated from the images suggest that the dust is nearly as cold as a\nblackbody. This requires the grains to be larger than ~100{\\mu}m, regardless of\ntheir material composition. To explain the dearth of small grains, we explore\nseveral conceivable scenarios: transport-dominated disks, disks of low\ndynamical excitation, and disks of unstirred primordial macroscopic grains. Our\nqualitative analysis and collisional simulations rule out the first two of\nthese scenarios, but show the feasibility of the third one. We show that such\ndisks can survive for gigayears, largely preserving the primordial size\ndistribution. They should be composed of macroscopic solids larger than\nmillimeters, but smaller than kilometers in size.

The potential scientific value and observability of\nthe atmospheres of these two classes of worlds varies significantly and given\nthe sheer number of candidates in this size-range, there is evidently a need\nfor a quick, simple metric to rank whether the planets have an extended\natmosphere or not.

Transit observations of the super-Earth GJ 1214b\nrule out a cloud-free H2-dominated atmosphere, but are not able to determine\nwhether the lack of deep spectral features is due to high-altitude clouds or\nthe presence of a high mean molecular mass atmosphere. Here, we demonstrate\nthat one can unambiguously distinguish between cloudy mini-Neptunes and\nvolatile-dominated worlds based on the differences in the wing steepness and\nrelative depths of water absorption features in moderate-resolution NIR\ntransmission spectra (R~100). In a numerical retrieval study, we show for GJ\n1214b that an unambiguous distinction between a cloudy H2-dominated atmosphere\nand cloud-free H2 atmosphere will be possible if the uncertainties in the\nspectral transit depth measurements can be reduced by a factor of ~3 compared\nto the published HST WFC3 and VLT transit observations. We argue that the\nrequired precision for the distinction may be achievable with currently\navailable instrumentation by stacking 10-15 transit observations.

To better confirm or refute\nthis result, systematic errors between telescopes must be minimized. We present\na new method to directly compare spectra of the same object and measure any\nvelocity shifts between them. This method allows for the discovery of\nwavelength-dependent velocity shifts between spectra, i.e. velocity\ndistortions, that could produce spurious detections of cosmological variations\nin fundamental constants. This \"direct comparison\" method has several\nadvantages over alternative techniques: it is model-independent (cf.\nline-fitting approaches), blind, in that spectral features do not need to be\nidentified beforehand, and it produces meaningful uncertainty estimates for the\nvelocity shift measurements. In particular, we demonstrate that, when comparing\nechelle-resolution spectra with unresolved absorption features, the uncertainty\nestimates are reliable for signal-to-noise ratios >7 per pixel. We apply this\nmethod to spectra of quasar J2123-0050 observed with Keck and the VLT and find\nno significant distortions over long wavelength ranges (~1050 Angstroms)\ngreater than ~180 m/s.

High-contrast direct imaging of circumstellar disks is\nlimited by quasi-static speckle noise and ADI is commonly used to suppress\nthose speckles. However, the application of ADI can result in self-subtraction\nof the disk signal due to the disk's finite spatial extent. This signal\nattenuation varies with radial separation and biases measurements of the disk's\nsurface brightness, thereby compromising inferences regarding the physical\nprocesses responsible for the dust distribution. To compensate for this\nattenuation, we forward-model the disk structure and compute the form of the\nself-subtraction function at each separation. As a proof of concept, we apply\nour method to 1.6 and 2.2 micron Keck AO NIRC2 scattered-light observations of\nthe HD 32297 debris disk reduced using a variant of the \"locally optimized\ncombination of images\" (LOCI) algorithm.

There is apparently no closed-form expression yet giving the potential\nof a three-dimensional homogeneous cylindrical or spherical cell, in contrast\nwith the Cartesian case. By using Green's theorem, we show that the potential\nintegral for such polar-type 3D sectors -- initially, a volume integral with\nsingular kernel -- can be converted into a regular line-integral running over\nthe lateral contour, thereby generalising a formula already known under axial\nsymmetry.

Large deviations between the abundances of\nthe host star and its gas giants seem likely to occur if the planet formation\nfollows the core-accretion scenario.

ProDiMo\nprotoplanetary disk models are used to predict the chemical evolution of gas\nand ice in the midplane. We find that cosmic rays play a crucial role in slowly\nun-blocking the CO, where the liberated oxygen forms water, which then freezes\nout quickly. Therefore, the C/O ratio in the gas phase is found to gradually\nincrease with time, in a region bracketed by the water and CO ice-lines.

Hydrodynamic simulations\nshow a transition from SL to AS rotation as the influence of rotation on\nconvection is reduced, but the opposite transition occurs at a different point\nin the parameter space. The system is bistable, i.e., SL and AS rotation\nprofiles can both be stable. We study the effect of a dynamo-generated magnetic\nfield on the large-scale flows, particularly on the possibility of bistable\nbehavior of differential rotation. We solve the hydromagnetic equations\nnumerically in a rotating spherical shell for a set of different radiative\nconductivities controlling the relative importance of convection. In agreement\nwith earlier findings, our models display SL rotation profiles when the\nrotational influence on convection is strong and a transition to AS when the\nrotational influence decreases. We find that dynamo-generated magnetic fields\nhelp to produce SL differential rotation compared to the hydrodynamic\nsimulations. We do not observe any bistable states of differential rotation. In\nthe AS cases we get coherent single-cell meridional circulation, whereas in SL\ncases we get multi-cellular patterns. In both cases, we obtain poleward\ncirculation near the surface with a magnitude close to that observed in the\nSun. Moreover, both differential rotation and meridional circulation have\nsignificant magnetic cycle-related variations that are similar in strength to\nthose of the Sun. Purely hydrodynamic simulations of differential rotation and\nmeridional circulation are shown to be of limited relevance as magnetic fields,\nself-consistently generated by dynamo action, significantly affect the flows. \n\n"}

The instrumental dead time per\nevent is relatively long (~2.5 msec), and varies by a few percent\nevent-to-event. The most obvious effect is a distortion of the white noise\nlevel in the power density spectrum (PDS) that cannot be modeled easily with\nthe standard techniques due to the variable nature of the dead time.

For the high\nsignal-to-noise data with large spectral range that is commonly employed in\nstellar astrophysics, that covariant structure can lead to dramatically\nunderestimated parameter uncertainties (and, in some cases, biases). We\nconstruct a likelihood function that accounts for the structure of the\ncovariance matrix, utilizing the machinery of Gaussian process kernels. This\nframework specifically address the common problem of mismatches in model\nspectral line strengths (with respect to data) due to intrinsic model\nimperfections (e.g., in the atomic/molecular databases or opacity\nprescriptions) by developing a novel local covariance kernel formalism that\nidentifies and self-consistently downweights pathological spectral line\n\"outliers.\" By fitting many spectra in a hierarchical manner, these local\nkernels provide a mechanism to learn about and build data-driven corrections to\nsynthetic spectral libraries.

We collect these easily evaluated\nconstraints into a workflow that can help guide the design and interpretation\nof new observational campaigns and numerical simulations of gap opening in such\nsystems. We argue that the locations of resonances should be significantly\nshifted in massive disks like HL Tau, and that theoretical uncertainties in the\nexact offset, together with observational errors, imply a large uncertainty in\nthe dynamical state and stability in such disks. This presents an important\nbarrier to using systems like HL Tau as a proxy for the initial conditions\nfollowing planet formation. An important observational avenue to breaking this\ndegeneracy is to search for eccentric gaps, which could implicate resonantly\ninteracting planets.

In this paper, we seek similar\nconnections in inflation, relating cosmological observations to the physics\nresponsible for the accelerated expansion. We assume that the inflationary\ntheory is Lorentz invariant at short distances, but allow for non-relativistic\ninteractions and a non-trivial speed of propagation at low energies. Focusing\non forward scattering, we derive a 'sum rule' which equates a combination of\nlow-energy parameters to an integral which is sensitive to the high-energy\nbehavior of the theory.

In this\npaper we present the predictions of the disc fragmentation model regarding the\nproperties of the discs around such low-mass objects. We find that the discs\naround objects that have formed by fragmentation in discs hosted by Sun-like\nstars (referred to as 'parent' discs and 'parent' stars) are more massive than\nexpected from the ${M}_{\\rm disc}-M_*$ relation (which is derived for stars\nwith masses $M_*>0.2 {\\rm M}_{\\odot}$). Accordingly, the accretion rates onto\nthese objects are also higher than expected from the $\\dot{M}_*-M_*$ relation.\nMoreover there is no significant correlation between the mass of the brown\ndwarf or planet with the mass of its disc nor with the accretion rate from the\ndisc onto it.

Here, I present the main conclusions from a\ncomprehensive atmospheric retrieval survey of eight hot Jupiters with\ndetectable molecular absorption in their near-infrared transmission spectra. I\nanalyze the eight transmission spectra using the newly-developed,\nself-consistent atmospheric retrieval framework, SCARLET. Unlike previous\nmethods, SCARLET combines the physical and chemical consistency of complex\natmospheric models with the statistical treatment of observational\nuncertainties known from atmospheric retrieval techniques. I find that all\neight hot Jupiters consistently require carbon-to-oxygen ratios (C/O) below\n0.9. The finding of C/O<0.9 is highly robust for HD209458b, WASP-12b, WASP-19b,\nHAT-P-1b, and XO-1b. For HD189733b, WASP-17b, and WASP-43b, I find that the\npublished WFC3 transmission spectra favor C/O<0.9 at greater than 95%\nconfidence. I further show that the water abundances on all eight hot Jupiters\nare consistent with solar composition. The relatively small depth of the\ndetected water absorption features is due to the presence of clouds, not due to\na low water abundance as previously suggested for HD209458b. The presence of a\nthick cloud deck is inferred for HD209458b and WASP-12b. HD189733b may host a\nsimilar cloud deck, rather than the previously suggested Rayleigh hazes, if\nstar spots affect the observed spectrum. The approach taken in SCARLET can be\nregarded as a new pathway to interpreting spectral observations of planetary\natmospheres.

The stream is\nunusual, among others, for several reasons: its very short duration around\nmaximum activity (~12 - 14 hours) as detected by visual, photographic and radar\nobservations, its recent onset (around 1835 AD) and because it had been the\nonly major stream without an obvious parent body until 2003. Ever since, there\nhave been debates as to the age of the stream and the nature of its proposed\nparent body, asteroid 2003 EH1.\n  In this work, we present results on the most probable age and formation\nmechanism of the narrow portion of the Quadrantid meteoroid stream. For the\nfirst time we use data on eight high precision photographic Quadrantids,\nequivalent to gram - kilogram size, to constrain the most likely age of the\ncore of the stream. Out of eight high-precision photographic Quadrantids, five\npertain directly to the narrow portion of the stream. In addition, we also use\ndata on five high-precision radar Quadrantids, observed within the peak of the\nshower.\n  We performed backwards numerical integrations of the equations of motion of a\nlarge number of 'clones' of both, the eight high-precision photographic and\nfive radar Quadrantid meteors, along with the proposed parent body, 2003 EH1.\nAccording to our results, from the backward integrations, the most likely age\nof the narrow structure of the Quadrantids is between 200 - 300 years.

Using new NIR interferometric\nobservations, we aim to characterize the 0.1-10~au region of the HD~139614 disk\nfurther and identify viable mechanisms for the inner disk clearing. We report\nthe first multiwavelength radiative transfer modeling of the interferometric\ndata acquired on HD~139614 with PIONIER, AMBER, and MIDI, complemented by\nHerschel/PACS photometries.

Since self-shadowing and\nphotoevaporation appears unlikely to be responsible for the au-sized gap of\nHD~139614, we thus tested if dynamical clearing could be a viable mechanism\nusing hydrodynamical simulations to predict the gaseous disk structure. Indeed,\na narrow au-sized gap is expected when a single giant planet interacts with the\ndisk.

We assert that mass measurements derived\nfrom these two methods are comparably reliable---as the physics underlying\ntheir respective signals is well understood. Nevertheless, their sensitivity to\nplanet mass varies with the properties of the planets themselves. We find that\nfor a given planet size, the RV method tends to find planets with higher mass\nwhile the sensitivity of TTVs is more uniform. This ``sensitivity bias''\nimplies that a complete census of TTV systems is likely to yield a more robust\nestimate of the mass-radius distribution provided there are not important\nphysical differences between planets near and far from mean-motion resonance.\nWe discuss differences in the sensitivity of the two methods with orbital\nperiod and system architecture, which may compound the discrepancies between\nthem (e.g., short period planets detectable by RVs may be more dense due to\natmospheric loss). We advocate for continued mass measurements using both\napproaches as a means both to measure the masses of more planets and to\nidentify potential differences in planet structure that may result from their\ndynamical and environmental histories. \n\n"}

The goal of this work is to determine the potential effect of\nstellar cosmic rays on key atmospheric species of Earth-like planets orbiting\nin the habitable zone of M-dwarf stars and show corresponding changes in the\nplanetary spectra. We build upon the cosmic rays model scheme of Grenfell et\nal. (2012), who considered cosmic ray induced NOx production, by adding further\ncosmic ray induced production mechanisms (e.g. for HOx) and introducing primary\nprotons of a wider energy range (16 MeV - 0.5 TeV). Previous studies suggested\nthat planets in the habitable zone that are subject to strong flaring\nconditions have high atmospheric methane concentrations, while their ozone\nbiosignature is completely destroyed. Our current study shows, however, that\nadding cosmic ray induced HOx production can cause a decrease in atmospheric\nmethane abundance of up to 80\\%. Furthermore, the cosmic ray induced HOx\nmolecules react with NOx to produce HNO$_3$, which produces strong HNO$_3$\nsignals in the theoretical spectra and reduces NOx-induced catalytic\ndestruction of ozone so that more than 25\\% of the ozone column remains. Hence,\nan ozone signal remains visible in the theoretical spectrum (albeit with a\nweaker intensity) when incorporating the new cosmic ray induced NOx and HOx\nschemes, even for a constantly flaring M-star case.

First, it would enable full two-dimensional\n(2-D) vector microlens parallax measurements for a substantial fraction of\nlow-mass lenses as well as planetary and binary events that show caustic\ncrossing features. For a significant fraction of the free-floating planet (FFP)\nevents and all caustic-crossing planetary/binary events, these 2-D parallax\nmeasurements directly lead to complete solutions (mass, distance, transverse\nvelocity) of the lens object (or lens system). For even more events, the\ncomplementary ground-based observations will yield 1-D parallax measurements.\nTogether with the 1-D parallaxes from \\emph{WFIRST} alone, they can probe the\nentire mass range $M\\gtrsim M_\\oplus$. For luminous lenses, such 1-D parallax\nmeasurements can be promoted to complete solutions (mass, distance, transverse\nvelocity) by high-resolution imaging. This would provide crucial information\nnot only about the hosts of planets and other lenses, but also enable a much\nmore precise Galactic model. Other benefits of such a survey include improved\nunderstanding of binaries (particularly with low mass primaries), and\nsensitivity to distant ice-giant and gas-giant companions of \\emph{WFIRST}\nlenses that cannot be detected by \\emph{WFIRST} itself due to its restricted\nobserving windows. Existing ground-based microlensing surveys can be employed\nif \\emph{WFIRST} is pointed at lower-extinction fields than is currently\nenvisaged. This would come at some cost to the event rate.

The problem\naddressed by the resolution is a lack of established conversion constants\nbetween solar and planetary values and SI units: a missing standard has caused\na proliferation of solar values (e.g., solar radius, solar irradiance, solar\nluminosity, solar effective temperature and solar mass parameter) in the\nliterature, with cited solar values typically based on best estimates at the\ntime of paper writing. As precision of observations increases, a set of\nconsistent values becomes increasingly important. To address this, an IAU\nWorking Group on Nominal Units for Stellar and Planetary Astronomy formed in\n2011, uniting experts from the solar, stellar, planetary, exoplanetary and\nfundamental astronomy, as well as from general standards fields to converge on\noptimal values for nominal conversion constants.

For typical Galactic lensing events with the Einstein radius of\n$\\sim 2$ AU, the asymmetry of the light curves due to bound planets can be\nnoticed up to $\\sim 20$AU.

We investigate whether the matter / anti-matter asymmetry of the\nuniverse can be created from the decaying helicity of a primordial\n(hyper)magnetic field before and after the electroweak phase transition. In\nthis model, baryogenesis occurs without $(B-L)$-violation, since the $(B+L)$\nasymmetry generated by the hypermagnetic field counteracts the washout by\nelectroweak sphalerons. At the electroweak crossover, the hypermagnetic field\nbecomes an electromagnetic field, which does not source $(B+L)$. Although the\nsphalerons remain in equilibrium for a time, washout is avoided since the\ndecaying magnetic helicity sources chirality. The relic baryon asymmetry is\nfixed when the electroweak sphaleron freezes out.

Magnetically aligned grains are\ncommonly interpreted as the source of polarization. However, self-scattering by\nlarge dust grains with a high enough albedo is another polarization mechanism,\nbecoming a compelling method independent of the spectral index to constrain the\ndust grain size in protoplanetary disks. We study the dust polarization at mm\nwavelength in the dust trapping scenario proposed for transition disks, when a\ngiant planet opens a gap in the disk. We investigate the characteristic\npolarization patterns and their dependence on disk inclination, dust size\nevolution, planet position, and observing wavelength. We combine\ntwo-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of planet-disk interactions with\nself-consistent dust growth models. These size-dependent dust density\ndistributions are used for follow-up three-dimensional radiative transfer\ncalculations to predict the polarization degree at ALMA bands due to scattered\nthermal emission. We find that the polarization pattern of a disk with a\nplanetary gap after 1 Myr of dust evolution shows a distinctive three ring\nstructure.

In contrast, the much less massive\nrings of Uranus and Neptune are dark and likely to have higher rock fraction.\nHere we investigate, for the first time, the tidal disruption of a passing\nobject, including the subsequent formation of planetary rings. First, we\nperform SPH simulations of the tidal destruction of big differentiated objects\n($M_{\\rm body}=10^{21-23}$) that experience close encounters with Saturn or\nUranus. We find that about $0.1-10$% of the mass of the passing body is\ngravitationally captured around the planet. However, these fragments are\ninitially big chunks and have highly eccentric orbits around the planet. Then,\nwe perform N-body simulations including the planet's oblateness, starting with\ndata obtained from the SPH simulations. Our N-body simulations show that the\nchunks are tidally destroyed during their next several orbits. Their individual\norbits then start to precess incoherently around the planet's equator, which\nenhances their encounter velocities on longer-term evolution, resulting in more\ndestructive impacts. These collisions would damp their eccentricities resulting\nin a progressive collapse of the debris cloud into a thin equatorial and\nlow-eccentricity ring. These high energy impacts are expected to be\ncatastrophic enough to produce small particles. Our numerical results also show\nthat the mass of formed rings is large enough to explain current rings\nincluding inner regular satellites around Saturn and Uranus. In the case of\nUranus, a body can go deeper inside the planet's Roche limit resulting in a\nmore efficient capture of rocky material compared to Saturn's case in which\nmostly ice is captured.

In a homogeneous Universe\nthe bispectrum is a function of five variables and unlike its two point\nstatistics counterpart -- the power spectrum, which is a function of only two\nvariables -- is difficult to analyse unless the information is somehow reduced.\nThe most commonly considered reduction schemes rely on computing angular\nintegrals over possible orientations of the bispectrum triangle, thus reducing\nit to sets of function of only three variables describing the triangle shape.\nWe use Fisher information formalism to study the information loss associated\nwith this angular integration. Without any reduction, the bispectrum alone can\ndeliver constraints on the growth rate parameter $f$ that are better by a\nfactor of $2.5$ compared to the power spectrum, for a sample of luminous red\ngalaxies expected from near future galaxy surveys at a redshift of $z\\sim0.65$.\nAt lower redshifts the improvement could be up to a factor of $3$.

Abstract: Recently, high angular resolution imaging instruments such as SPHERE and GPI\nhave discovered many spiral-arm-like features in near-infrared scattered light\nimages of protoplanetary disks. Theory and simulations have suggested that\nthese arms are most likely excited by planets forming in the disks; however, a\nquantitative relation between the arm-to-disk brightness contrast and planet\nmass is still missing. Using 3D hydrodynamics and radiative transfer\nsimulations, we examine the morphology and contrast of planet-induced arms in\ndisks. We find a power-law relation for the face-on arm contrast ($\\delta_{\\rm\nmax}$) as a function of planet mass ($M_{\\rm p}$) and disk aspect ratio\n($h/r$): $\\delta_{\\rm max}\\approx((M_{\\rm p}/M_{\\rm J})/(h/r)^{1.38})^{0.22}$.\nWith current observational capability, at a 30 AU separation, the minimum\nplanet mass for driving detectable arms in a disk around a 1 Myr 1$M_\\odot$\nstar at 140 pc at low inclinations is around Saturn mass. For planets more\nmassive than Neptune masses, they typically drive multiple arms. Therefore in\nobserved disks with spirals, it is unlikely that each spiral arm originates\nfrom a different planet. We also find only massive perturbers with at least\nmulti-Jupiter masses are capable of driving bright arms with $\\delta_{\\rm\nmax}\\gtrsim2$ as found in SAO 206462, MWC 758, and LkH$\\alpha$~330, and these\narms do not follow linear wave propagation theory. Additionally, we find the\nmorphology and contrast of the primary and secondary arms are largely\nunaffected by a modest level of viscosity with $\\alpha\\lesssim0.01$. Finally,\nthe contrast of the arms in the SAO 206462 disk suggests that the perturber SAO\n206462 b at $\\sim100$ AU is about $5-10M_{\\rm J}$ in mass. \n\n"}

However, no simple way to estimate the potential\nprecision of such timing measures has been presented yet, nor are guidelines\navailable regarding the relation between timing errors and sampling rate.\n  Aims: A `timing error estimator' (TEE) equation is presented that requires\nonly basic transit parameters as input. With the TEE, it is straightforward to\nestimate timing precisions both for actual data as well as for future\ninstruments, such as the TESS and PLATO space missions.\n  Methods: A derivation of the timing error based on a trapezoidal transit\nshape is given. We also verify the TEE on realistically modeled transits using\nMonte Carlo simulations and determine its validity range, exploring in\nparticular the interplay between ingress/egress times and sampling rates.\n  Results: The simulations show that the TEE gives timing errors very close to\nthe correct value, as long as the temporal sampling is faster than transit\ningress/egress durations and transits with very low S/N are avoided.\n  Conclusions: The TEE is a useful tool to estimate eclipse or transit timing\nerrors in actual and future data-sets. In combination with an equation to\nestimate period errors (Deeg 2015), predictions for the ephemeris precision of\nlong-coverage observations are possible as well. The tests for the TEE's\nvalidity-range led also to implications for instrumental design: Temporal\nsampling has to be faster than transit in- or egress durations, or a loss in\ntiming-precision will occur. An application to the TESS mission shows that\ntransits close to its detection limit will have timing uncertainties that\nexceed 1 hour within a few months after their acquisition.

Searching for the transits of the low-mass planets\ndetected by Doppler surveys is a straightforward way to achieve this goal.\nIndeed, Doppler surveys target the most nearby main-sequence stars, they\nregularly detect close-in low-mass planets with significant transit\nprobability, and their radial velocity data constrain strongly the ephemeris of\npossible transits.

Even when the presence of a transiting planet and hence\nits period are known, stellar activity can be the main barrier to measuring the\ncorrect amplitude of the radial velocity signal. Several tools are being used\nto help understand which signals come from stellar activity in the data.

The\nmultiple, long, and variable transits suggest the transiting objects are dust\nclouds, probably produced by a disintegrating asteroid. In addition, the system\ncontains circumstellar gas, evident by broad absorption lines, mostly in the\nu'-band, and a dust disc, indicated by an infrared excess. Here we present the\nfirst detection of a change in colour of WD1145+017 during transits, using\nsimultaneous multi-band fast-photometry ULTRACAM measurements over the\nu'g'r'i'-bands. The observations reveal what appears to be 'bluing' during\ntransits; transits are deeper in the redder bands, with a u'-r' colour\ndifference of up to ~-0.05 mag. We explore various possible explanations for\nthe bluing. 'Spectral' photometry obtained by integrating over bandpasses in\nthe spectroscopic data in- and out-of-transit, compared to the photometric\ndata, shows that the observed colour difference is most likely the result of\nreduced circumstellar absorption in the spectrum during transits.

The optical Fe II\nstrength in NLSy1 galaxies is about two times larger than the broad- line\nSeyfert 1 (BLSy1) galaxies. About 5% of the catalog sources are detected in the\nFIRST survey. The Eddington ratio (XEdd) of NLSy1 galaxies has an average of\nlog XEdd of -0.34, much higher than -1.03 found for BLSy1 galaxies.

However the lensing\ndeflections also change the photon path so that the emission angle is no longer\northogonal to the background last-scattering surface. We give the first\ncalculation of the emission-angle corrections to the standard lensing\napproximation from dipole (Doppler) sources for temperature and quadrupole\nsources for temperature and polarization. We show that while the corrections\nare negligible for the temperature and E-mode polarization, additional\nlarge-scale B-modes are produced with a white spectrum that dominates those\nfrom post-Born field rotation (curl lensing). On large scales about one percent\nof the total lensing-induced B-mode amplitude is expected to be due to this\neffect. However, the photon emission angle does remain orthogonal to the\nperturbed last-scattering surface due to time delay, and half of the\nlarge-scale emission-angle B modes cancel with B modes from time delay to give\na total contribution of about half a percent. While not important for planned\nobservations, the signal could ultimately limit the ability of delensing to\nreveal low amplitudes of primordial gravitational waves.We also derive the\nrotation of polarization due to multiple deflections between emission and\nobservation. The rotation angle is of quadratic order in the deflection angle,\nand hence negligibly small: polarization typically rotates by less than an\narcsecond, orders of magnitude less than a small-scale image rotates due to\npost-Born field rotation (which is quadratic in the shear).

Both\nthe orbit of the spacecraft and the electromagnetic signals themselves are\naffected by the curvature of spacetime. The arrival time of the pulses is\ncompared to the ticks of local clocks to reconstruct the orbital path of the\nsatellite to high accuracy, and to implicitly measure general relativistic\neffects. In particular, Schwarzschild space curvature (static) and\nframe-dragging (stationary) due to the planet's spin affect the satellite's\norbit. The dominant relativistic effect on the path of the signal photons is\nShapiro delay due to static space curvature. We compute these effects for some\ncurrent and proposed space missions, using a Hamiltonian formulation in four\ndimensions. For highly eccentric orbits, such as in the Juno mission and in the\nCassini Grand Finale, the relativistic effects have a kick-like nature, which\ncould be advantageous for detecting them if their signatures are properly\nmodeled as functions of time. Frame-dragging appears, in principle, measurable\nby Juno and Cassini, though not by Galileo 5 and 6. Practical measurement would\nrequire disentangling frame-dragging from the Newtonian 'foreground' such as\nthe gravitational quadrupole which has an impact on both the spacecraft's orbit\nand the signal propagation.

Here we focus on the\ngeneral properties of magnetic fields and the diffuse radio emission in galaxy\nclusters. Magnetic fields are prevalent in galaxies, and their build-up is\nclosely linked to structure formation.

The magnetic field\ntopology is closely connected to galaxy morphology such that irregular fields\nare hosted by early-type galaxies, while large-scale, ordered fields are\npresent in disc galaxies. Using two simple models for the energy distribution\nof relativistic electrons we predict the diffuse radio emission of $280$\nclusters with a baryonic mass resolution of $1.1\\times 10^{7}\\,{\\rm\nM_{\\odot}}$, and generate mock observations for VLA, LOFAR, ASKAP and SKA.

To do so, we use logistic regression combined with\nAkaike's information criterion to assess in- and out-of-class networks, grades,\nand other factors.

Exoplanet atmosphere\nstudies require stellar background spectra to be known along the transit path\nwhile detection of Earth analogs require stellar microvariability to be\nunderstood. Hydrodynamic 3-D models can be computed for widely different stars\nbut have been tested in detail only for the Sun with its resolved surface\nfeatures. Model predictions include spectral line shapes, asymmetries, and\nwavelength shifts, and their center-to-limb changes across stellar disks. AIMS:\nTo observe high-resolution spectral line profiles across spatially highly\nresolved stellar surfaces, which are free from the effects of spatial smearing\nand rotational broadening present in full-disk spectra, enabling comparisons to\nsynthetic profiles from 3-D models. METHODS: During exoplanet transits,\nsuccessive stellar surface portions become hidden and differential spectroscopy\nbetween various transit phases provides spectra of small surface segments\ntemporarily hidden behind the planet. Planets cover no more than about 1% of\nany main-sequence star, enabling high spatial resolution but demanding very\nprecise observations. Realistically measurable quantities are identified\nthrough simulated observations of synthetic spectral lines.

A huge volume of observational data in unprecedented\nquantity and quality and a more consistent theoretical framework propelled\ncosmology to an era of precision, turning the discipline into a cutting-edge\narea of contemporary science. Observations with type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia),\nshowed that the expanding Universe is accelerating, an unexplained fact in the\ntraditional decelerated model.

In\nthis context, without giving up a pedagogical approach, we present an overview\nof both the main theoretical results and the most significant observational\ndiscoveries of cosmology in the last 100 years.

The T dependency of VUV\nabsorption cross sections are poorly known, leading to an undefined uncertainty\nin atmospheric models. Similarly, data measured at low T similar to that of the\nhigh atmosphere of Mars, Venus, and Titan are often lacking. Our aim is to\nquantify the T dependency of the abs. cross section of important molecules in\nplanetary atmospheres. We want to provide both high-resolution data at T\nprevailing in these media and a simple parameterization of the absorption in\norder to simplify its use in photochemical models. This study focuses on carbon\ndioxide. We performed experimental measurements of CO$_2$ absorption cross\nsection with synchrotron radiation for the wavelength range (115--200nm). For\nlonger wavelengths (195--230nm), we used a deuterium lamp and a 1.5m Jobin-Yvon\nspectrometer.

The variation of\nthe continuum of absorption can be represented by the sum of three gaussian\nfunctions. Using data at high T in thermo-photochemical models modifies\nsignificantly the abundance and the photodissociation rates of many species, in\naddition to CO$_2$, such as methane and ammonia.

Bona-fide single planet systems are fitted with a Keplerian model. The\nmultiple planet systems were analyzed using a self-consistent dynamical model\nand their best fit orbits were tested for long-term stability.\n  Results: We confirm or provide supportive arguments for planets around all\nthe investigated stars except for GJ15A, for which we find that the\npost-discovery HIRES data and our CARMENES data do not show a signal at 11.4\ndays.

Specifically, we constrain the upper and lower pressure boundaries\nof aerosol layers, and present plausible composition candidates. We study the\ncase of the bloated Saturn-mass planet WASP-49b, where near-infrared\nobservations reveal a flat transmission spectrum between 0.7 and 1.0\n{\\microns}.

Because of its flexible\ndesign, flame can be easily applied to data obtained with a wide variety of\nspectrographs. The flexibility is due to a modular architecture, which allows\nchanges and customizations to the pipeline, and relegates the\ninstrument-specific parts to a single module. At the core of the data reduction\nis the transformation from observed pixel coordinates (x, y) to rectified\ncoordinates (lambda, gamma). This transformation consists in the polynomial\nfunctions lambda(x,y) and gamma(x,y) that are derived from arc or sky emission\nlines and slit edge tracing, respectively. The use of 2D transformations allows\none to wavelength calibrate and rectify the data using just one interpolation\nstep.

It works by detecting the velocity of a host star induced\nby the gravitational effect of an orbiting planet, specifically the velocity\nalong our line of sight, which is called the radial velocity of the star.\nLow-mass planets typically cause their host star to move with radial velocities\nof 1 m/s or less. By analyzing a time series of stellar spectra from a host\nstar, modern astronomical instruments can in theory detect such planets.\nHowever, in practice, intrinsic stellar variability (e.g., star spots,\nconvective motion, pulsations) affects the spectra and often mimics a radial\nvelocity signal. This signal contamination makes it difficult to reliably\ndetect low-mass planets. A principled approach to recovering planet radial\nvelocity signals in the presence of stellar activity was proposed by Rajpaul et\nal. (2015). It uses a multivariate Gaussian process model to jointly capture\ntime series of the apparent radial velocity and multiple indicators of stellar\nactivity. We build on this work in two ways: (i) we propose using dimension\nreduction techniques to construct new high-information stellar activity\nindicators; and (ii) we extend the Rajpaul et al. (2015) model to a larger\nclass of models and use a power-based model comparison procedure to select the\nbest model. Despite significant interest in exoplanets, previous efforts have\nnot performed large-scale stellar activity model selection or attempted to\nevaluate models based on planet detection power. In the case of main sequence\nG2V stars, we find that our method substantially improves planet detection\npower compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches. \n\n"}

As a higher derivative\ntheory, Covariant Galileon models do not have a $\\Lambda$CDM limit and predict\na very different structure formation pattern compared with the standard\n$\\Lambda$CDM scenario. Previous cosmological analyses suggest that this model\nis marginally disfavoured, yet can not be completely ruled out. In this work we\nuse a more recent and extended combination of data, and we allow for more\nfreedom in the cosmology, by including a massive neutrino sector with three\ndifferent mass hierarchies. We use the Planck measurements of Cosmic Microwave\nBackground temperature and polarization; Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations\nmeasurements by BOSS DR12; local measurements of $H_0$; the joint light-curve\nanalysis supernovae sample; and, for the first time, weak gravitational lensing\nfrom the KiDS collaboration.

The circulation of exoplanets with\n$P_{orb} \\leq $ 25~days can be dominated by the standing tropical Rossby wave\nin the troposphere and also in the stratosphere: It leads to a strong\nequatorial eastward wind jet and to 'Anti-Brewer-Dobson'-circulation that\nconfines air masses to the stratospheric equatorial region. Thus, the\ndistribution of photo-chemically produced species and aerosols may be limited\nto an 'equatorial transport belt'. In contrast, planets with $P_{orb}>25$~days,\nlike GJ~667~C~f, exhibit efficient thermally driven circulation in the\nstratosphere that allows for a day side-wide distribution of air masses.\n  The influence of the standing tropical Rossby waves on tidally locked\nExoEarths with $P_{orb} \\leq 25$~days can, however, be circumvented with deep\nstratospheric wind breaking alone - allowing for equator-to-pole transport like\non Earth.

In each case we determine the set of initial\nconditions which give rise to sufficient inflation, with at least $60$\ne-foldings.

In both cases we find Higgs inflation to\nbe very robust since it can arise for a large class of initial conditions.

The fundamental diffraction limit constrains the\nresolving power of both ground-based and spaceborne telescopes. The recent idea\nof a quantum telescope based on the optical parametric amplification (OPA) of\nlight aims to bypass this limit for the imaging of extended sources by an order\nof magnitude or more. We present an updated scheme of an OPA-based device and a\nmore accurate model of the signal amplification by such a device. The\nsemiclassical model that we present predicts that the noise in such a system\nwill form so-called light speckles as a result of light interference in the\noptical path. Based on this model, we analysed the efficiency of OPA in\nincreasing the angular resolution of the imaging of extended targets and the\nprecise localization of a distant point source. According to our new model, OPA\noffers a gain in resolved imaging in comparison to classical optics. For a\ngiven time-span, we found that OPA can be more efficient in localizing a single\ndistant point source than classical telescopes. \n\n"}

We examine in detail the challenges of image plane fitting vs\ndirectly fitting the visibilities, while also considering the role of the\nvertical temperature gradient, systematic uncertainty in the amplitude\ncalibration, and assumptions about the CO abundance, as potential sources of\nthe discrepancy in the turbulence measurements. These tests result in\nvariations of the turbulence limit between $<$0.04c$_s$ and $<$0.13c$_s$,\nconsistently lower than the 0.2-0.4c$_s$ found previously. Having ruled out\nnumerous factors, we restrict the source of the discrepancy to our assumed\ncoupling between temperature and density through hydrostatic equilibrium in the\npresence of a vertical temperature gradient and/or the confinement of CO to a\nthin molecular layer above the midplane, although further work is needed to\nquantify the influence of these prescriptions.

It is still an open question on how efficient this process\nworks in realistic turbulent discs. Here, we investigate the accretion of\npebbles in turbulent discs that are driven by the purely hydrodynamical\nvertical shear instability (VSI). For this purpose, we perform global\nthree-dimensional simulations of locally isothermal, VSI turbulent discs with\nembedded protoplanetary cores from 5 to 100 $M_\\oplus$ that are placed at 5.2\nau distance from the star. In addition, we follow the evolution of a swarm of\nembedded pebbles of different size under the action of drag forces between gas\nand particles in this turbulent flow. Simultaneously, we perform a set of\ncomparison simulations for laminar viscous discs where the particles experience\nstochastic kicks. For both cases, we measure the accretion rate onto the cores\nas a function of core mass and Stokes number ($\\tau_s$) of the particles and\ncompare it to recent MRI turbulence simulations. Overall the dynamic is very\nsimilar for the particles in the VSI turbulent disc and the laminar case with\nstochastic kicks. For the small mass planets (i.e. 5 and 10 $M_\\oplus$),\nwell-coupled particles with $\\tau_s = 1$, which have a size of about one meter\nat this location, we find an accretion efficiency (rate of particles accreted\nover drifting inward) of about 1.6-3%. For smaller and larger particles this\nefficiency is higher. However, the fast inward drift for $\\tau_s = 1$ particles\nmakes them the most effective for rapid growth, leading to mass doubling times\nof about 20,000 yr. For masses between 10 and 30 $M_\\oplus$ the core reaches\nthe pebble isolation mass and the particles are trapped at the pressure maximum\njust outside of the planet, shutting off further particle accretion. \n\n"}

All of these characteristics are consistent\nwith models of self-scattering of submillimeter-wave emission from an optically\nthin inclined disk. The distribution of the polarization position angles across\nthe disk reveals that while the average orientation is along the minor axis,\nthe polarization orientations show a significant spread in angles; this can\nalso be explained by models of pure scattering. We compare the polarization\nwith that of the Class I/II source HL Tau. A comparison of cuts of the\npolarization fraction across the major and minor axes of both sources reveals\nthat IM Lup has a substantially higher polarization fraction than HL Tau toward\nthe center of the disk. This enhanced polarization fraction could be due a\nnumber of factors, including higher optical depth in HL Tau, or scattering by\nlarger dust grains in the more evolved IM Lup disk. However, models yield\nsimilar maximum grain sizes for both HL Tau (72 $\\mu$m) and IM Lup (61 $\\mu$m,\nthis work).

The candidate exomoon would be about the size and mass of\nNeptune, considerably larger than any moon in our Solar System, and if\nconfirmed, would be the first in a new class of giant moons or binary planets.\nMotivated by the large mass ratio in the Kepler-1625b planet and satellite\nsystem, we investigate the detectability of similarly massive exomoons around\ndirectly imaged exoplanets via Doppler spectroscopy. The candidate moon around\nKepler-1625b would induce a radial velocity signal of about 200 m/s on its host\nplanet, large enough that similar moons around directly imaged planets orbiting\nbright, nearby stars might be detected with current or next generation\ninstrumentation.

These planet candidates are suitable\nfor further spectroscopic follow-up and precise mass determinations, leading\nultimately to the construction of empirical mass-radius diagrams. Particularly\ninteresting is to constrain the properties of planets between the Earth and\nNeptune in size, the most abundant type of planets orbiting Sun-like stars with\nperiods less than a few years. Among many other K2 candidates, we discovered a\nmulti-planetary system around EPIC246471491, with four planets ranging in size\nfrom twice the size of Earth, to nearly the size of Neptune.

We are concerned with the effects of the\nnon-minimal coupling term on the growth of matter overdensities. Under the\nquasi-static approximation, we derive the equation which governs the evolution\nof matter density perturbations, and it is shown that the effective\ngravitational coupling 'constant' acquires an additional contribution due to\nthe non-minimal matter-torsion coupling term. In this way, this result\ngeneralizes those previously obtained for the growth of matter overdensities in\nthe case of minimal $f(T)$ gravity. In order to get a feeling of our results we\napply them to the important case of a power-law coupling function, which we\nassume to be the responsible for the late-time accelerated expansion in the\ndark energy regime.

Despite many efforts in trying to mitigate the effect of\nstellar activity using empirical and statistical techniques, it seems that we\nare facing an obstacle that will be extremely difficult to overcome using\ncurrent techniques. In this paper, we investigate a novel approach to derive\nprecise RVs considering the wealth of information present in high-resolution\nspectra. This new method consists in building a master spectrum from all\nobservations and measure the RVs of each spectral line in a spectrum relative\nto it. When analysing several spectra, the final product is the RVs of each\nline as a function of time. We demonstrate on three stars intensively observed\nwith HARPS that our new method gives RVs that are extremely similar to the ones\nderived from the HARPS data reduction software. Our new approach to derive RVs\ndemonstrates that the non-stability of daily HARPS wavelength solution induces\nnight-to-night RV offsets with an standard deviation of 0.4 m/s, and we propose\na solution to correct for this systematic. Finally, and this is probably the\nmost astrophysically relevant result of this paper, we demonstrate that some\nspectral lines are strongly affected by stellar activity while others are not.\nBy measuring the RVs on two carefully selected subsample of spectral lines, we\ndemonstrate that we can boost by a factor of 2 or mitigate by a factor of 1.6\nthe red noise induced by stellar activity in the 2010 RVs of Alpha Cen B. By\nmeasuring the RVs of each spectral line, we are able to reach the same RV\nprecision as other approved techniques.

This essentially brings in a\ndiscontinuity into the parameters space for $w_x$. Such discontinuity can be\nremoved with some specific choices of the interaction or coupling function. In\nthe present work we choose one particular coupling between dark matter and dark\nenergy which can successfully remove such instability and we allow a dynamical\ndark energy equation of state parameter instead of the constant one. In\nparticular, considering a dynamical dark energy equation of state with only one\nfree parameter $w_0$, representing the current value of the dark energy\nequation of state, we confront the interacting scenario with several\nobservational datasets. The results show that the present cosmological data\nallow an interaction in the dark sector, in agreement with some latest claims\nby several authors, and additionally, a phantom behaviour in the dark energy\nequation of state is suggested at present.

However, within the exoplanet direct\nimaging community, non-detections have almost exclusively been defined using a\nfrequentist detection threshold (i.e. contrast curve) and associated\ncompleteness. This can lead to conceptual inconsistencies when included in a\nBayesian framework. A Bayesian upper limit is such that the true value of a\nparameter lies below this limit with a certain probability. The associated\nprobability is the integral of the posterior distribution with the upper limit\nas the upper bound. In summary, a frequentist upper limit is a statement about\nthe detectability of planets while a Bayesian upper limit is a statement about\nthe probability of a parameter to lie in an interval given the data. The latter\nis therefore better suited for rejecting hypotheses or theoretical models based\non their predictions. In this work we emphasize that Bayesian statistics and\nupper limits are more easily interpreted and typically more constraining than\nthe frequentist approach. We illustrate the use of Bayesian analysis in two\ndifferent cases: 1) with a known planet location where we also propose to use\nmodel comparison to constrain the astrophysical nature of the point source and\n2) gap-carving planets in TW Hya.

This paper presents the\nmethods developed to calibrate the raw photometry of the MASCARA and bRing\nstations and characterizes the performance of the methods and instruments.\nMethods: For the primary calibration a modified version of the coarse\ndecorrelation algorithm is used, which corrects for the extinction due to the\nearth's atmosphere, the camera transmission, and intrapixel variations.\nResidual trends are removed from the light curves of individual stars using\nempirical secondary calibration methods. In order to optimize these methods, as\nwell as characterize the performance of the instruments, transit signals were\ninjected in the data. Results: After optimal calibration an RMS scatter of 10\nmmag at $m_V \\sim 7.5$ is achieved in the light curves. By injecting transit\nsignals with periods between one and five days in the MASCARA data obtained by\nthe La Palma station over the course of one year, we demonstrate that MASCARA\nLa Palma is able to recover 84.0, 60.5 and 20.7% of signals with depths of 2, 1\nand 0.5% respectively, with a strong dependency on the observed declination,\nrecovering 65.4% of all transit signals at $\\delta > 0^\\circ$ versus 35.8% at\n$\\delta < 0^\\circ$.

Among other data, these sky surveys collect information\nabout millions and sometimes billions of extra-galactic objects. Since the very\nlarge number of objects makes manual observation impractical, automatic methods\nthat can analyze and annotate extra-galactic objects are required to fully\nutilize the discovery power of these databases. Machine learning methods for\nannotation of celestial objects can be separated broadly into methods that use\nthe photometric information collected by digital sky surveys, and methods that\nanalyze the image of the object. Here we describe a hybrid method that combines\nphotometry and image data to annotate galaxies by their morphology, and a\nmethod that uses that information to identify objects that are visually similar\nto a query object (query-by-example). The results are compared to using just\nphotometric information from SDSS, and to using just the morphological\ndescriptors extracted directly from the images.

As radio emission from solar-like stars is\nconcentrated in active regions, a planet occulting a starspot can cause a\ndisproportionately deep transit which should be detectable with major radio\narrays currently under development, such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA).\nWe calculate the radiometric sensitivity of the SKA stages and components,\nfinding that SKA2-Mid can expect to detect transits around the very nearest\nsolar-like stars and many cool dwarfs.

We employ a catalog of\nvery-low-mass objects from Pan-STARRS data release 1 (PDR1) as potential lens\nstars, and we use the objects from Gaia data release 2 (GDR2) as potential\nsource stars.

This is not fast enough to form galaxies and to account for the\nobserved present-day inhomogeneities. This problem is usually resolved by\nassuming that at the recombination epoch the baryons settle down in the\npotential well of the dark matter previously assembled during the radiation era\nof the universe. This view is challenged in the present paper by using the\nrecently proposed model of a scale-invariant framework for cosmology that\nenlarges the invariance group subtending the theory of the gravitation.\n  From the continuity equation, the Euler and Poisson equations written in the\nscale-invariant framework, the equation governing the growth of the density\nfluctuations is obtained.

This level of precision allows researchers\nto measure the loss of light due to exoplanet transits as well as the light\nemitted by an exoplanet, or planetary photometric emissions. The planetary\nphotometric emissions are due to the thermal emissions of the exoplanet, and\nreflected stellar light. In many cases it is assumed that the incident stellar\nlight may be modeled as plane parallel rays. For extremely close-in exoplanets\nthe finite angular size of the host star must be taken into account and the\nplane parallel ray model breaks down. One consequence of modeling the incident\nstellar radiation in this manner is the creation of three distinct zones as\nopposed to the two zones present in the plane parallel ray model. The three\nzones are the fully illuminated, penumbral, and un-illuminated zones. The\nexistence of the penumbral zone means that more than half of the exoplanet will\nbe at least partially illuminated by the host star. In this work we will\npresent a complete derivation of the reflective luminosity of the fully\nilluminated zone. In addition, we will present an outline for the derivation of\nthe reflected intensity distribution of the penumbral zone. Within this work we\nwill also derive a new expression for the thermal luminosity of an exoplanet by\ntreating each of the three zones as a blackbody emitting at a constant\ntemperature. Finally, it will be shown that an estimation of the radius of the\nexoplanet requires proper accounting of light from the penumbral zone during\nthe primary transit.

Here we\nsimulate the RV oscillations produced by sectoral r modes with $2 \\leq m \\leq\n5$ assuming a stellar rotation period of 25.54 days and a maximum amplitude of\nthe surface velocity of each mode of 2 m/s. This amplitude is representative of\nthe solar measurements, except for the $m=2$ mode which has not yet been\nobserved. Sectoral r modes with azimuthal orders $m=2$ and $3$ would produce RV\noscillations with amplitudes of 76.4 and 19.6 cm/s and periods of 19.16 and\n10.22 days, respectively, for a star with an inclination of the rotation axis\n$i=60^{\\circ}$. Therefore, they may produce rather sharp peaks in the Fourier\nspectrum of the radial velocity time series that could lead to spurious\nplanetary detections. Sectoral r~modes may represent a source of confusion in\nthe case of slowly rotating inactive stars that are preferential targets for RV\nplanet search. The main limitation of the present investigation is the lack of\nobservational constraint on the amplitude of the $m=2$ mode on the Sun. \n\n"}

Then, spherically symmetric and static traversable Morris-Thorne\nwormholes in the presence of a generic cosmological constant are analyzed. A\nmatching of an interior solution to the unique exterior vacuum solution is done\nusing directly the Einstein equations. The structure as well as several\nphysical properties and characteristics of traversable wormholes due to the\neffects of the cosmological term are studied. Interesting equations appear in\nthe process of matching. For instance, one finds that for asymptotically flat\nand anti-de Sitter spacetimes the surface tangential pressure of the\nthin-shell, at the boundary of the interior and exterior solutions, is always\nstrictly positive, whereas for de Sitter spacetime it can take either sign as\none could expect, being negative (tension) for relatively high cosmological\nconstant and high wormhole radius, positive for relatively high mass and small\nwormhole radius, and zero in-between.

One can define the\nproper-time/velocity pair, as well as the coordinate-time/velocity pair, of a\ntraveler using only distances measured with respect to a single ``map'' frame.\nWhen this is done, the relativistic equations for momentum, energy, constant\nacceleration, and force take on forms strikingly similar to their Newtonian\ncounterparts. Thus high-school and college students not ready for Lorentz\ntransforms may solve relativistic versions of any single-frame Newtonian\nproblems they have mastered.

Bell's commendation of ``frame-dependent'' perspectives to the\nlimit here, and consider motion on a ``map'' of landmarks and clocks fixed with\nrespect to a single arbitrary inertial-reference frame. The metric equation\nconnects a traveler-time with map-times, yielding simple integrals of constant\nproper-acceleration over space (energy), traveler-time (felt impulse), map-time\n(momentum), and time on the clocks of a chase-plane determined to see Galileo's\noriginal equations apply at high speed. Rules follow for applying frame-variant\nand proper forces in context of one frame. Their usefulness in curved\nspacetimes via the equivalence principle is maximized by using synchrony-free\nand/or frame-invariant forms for length, time, velocity, and acceleration. In\ncontext of any single system of locally inertial frames, the metric equation\nthus lets us express electric and magnetic effects with a single\nframe-invariant but velocity-dependent force, and to contrast such forces with\ngravity as well. \n\n"}

The light thus appears to be redshifted\nrelative to the frequency of the clock. On the other hand the phenomenon is\nalternatively discussed (even in some authoritative texts) in terms of an\nenergy loss of a photon as it overcomes the gravitational attraction of the\nmassive body. This second approach operates with notions such as the\n\"gravitational mass\" or the \"potential energy\" of a photon and we assert that\nit is misleading.

We consider particularly two-level agents such as\nelectrons immersed in a magnetic field. Work is produced in that case when the\nelectrons are being carried from a high-magnetic-field region into a\nlow-magnetic-field region. In watermills, work is produced instead when some\namount of fluid drops from a high-altitude reservoir to a low-altitude\nreservoir. We show that this purely mechanical engine may in fact be considered\nas a two-level quantum heat engine, provided the fluid is viewed as consisting\nof n molecules of weight one and N-n molecules of weight zero. Weight-one\nmolecules are analogous to electrons in their higher energy state, while\nweight-zero molecules are analogous to electrons in their lower energy state.\nMore generally, fluids consist of non-interacting molecules of various weights.\nIt is shown that, not only the average value of the work produced per cycle,\nbut also its fluctuations, are the same for mechanical engines and quantum\n(Otto) heat engines. The reversible Carnot cycles are approached through the\nconsideration of multiple sub-reservoirs. \n\n"}
