Of particular importance for\nbiological applications are networks in which the indegree for each variable is\nbounded by a fixed constant, as was stressed by Kauffman in his original\npapers.\n  An important question is which conditions on the network topology can rule\nout exponentially long periodic orbits in the system. In this paper we consider\ncooperative systems, i.e. systems with positive feedback interconnections among\nall variables, which in a continuous setting guarantees a very stable dynamics.\nIn Part I of this paper we presented a construction that shows that for an\narbitrary constant 0<c<2 and sufficiently large n there exist n-dimensional\nBoolean cooperative networks in which both the indegree and outdegree of each\nfor each variable is bounded by two (bi-quadratic networks) and which\nnevertheless contain periodic orbits of length at least c^n.\n  In this part, we prove an inverse result showing that for sufficiently large\nn and for 0<c<2 sufficiently close to 2, any n-dimensional cooperative,\nbi-quadratic Boolean network with a cycle of length at least c^n must have a\nlarge proportion of variables with indegree 1.

They allow us\nto calculate any physical quantity dealing with $N$ excitons in terms of \"Pauli\nscatterings\" for carrier exchange in the absence of carrier interaction and\n\"interaction scatterings\" for carrier interaction in the absence of carrier\nexchange.

{"id": "0903.4656", "contents": "Title: Path Integral Method for DNA Denaturation Abstract: The statistical physics of homogeneous DNA is investigated by the imaginary\ntime path integral formalism. The base pair stretchings are described by an\nensemble of paths selected through a macroscopic constraint, the fulfillement\nof the second law of thermodynamics. The number of paths contributing to the\npartition function strongly increases around and above a specific temperature\n$T^*_c$ whereas the fraction of unbound base pairs grows continuosly around and\nabove $T^*_c$. The latter is identified with the denaturation temperature.\nThus, the separation of the two complementary strands appears as a highly\ncooperative phenomenon displaying a smooth crossover versus $T$. The\nthermodynamical properties have been computed in a large temperature range by\nvarying the size of the path ensemble at the lower bound of the range. No\nsignificant physical dependence on the system size has been envisaged. The\nentropy grows continuosly versus $T$ while the specific heat displays a\nremarkable peak at $T^*_c$. The location of the peak versus $T$ varies with the\nstiffness of the anharmonic stacking interaction along the strand. The\npresented results suggest that denaturation in homogeneous DNA has the features\nof a second order phase transition. The method accounts for the cooperative\nbehavior of a very large number of degrees of freedom while the computation\ntime is kept within a reasonable limit. \n\n"}

Although the stepping stone model was first proposed for\npopulation genetics, it is closely related to \"voter models\" of interest in\nnonequilibrium statistical mechanics. The stepping stone model can also be\nregarded as an approximation to the dynamics of a thin layer of actively\ngrowing pioneers at the frontier of a colony of microorganisms undergoing a\nrange expansion on a Petri dish.

Using the recipe, we\nderive an expression for the persistent current in a 1D ring made of an\ninsulator with an arbitrary valence band E(k). To find an exact result for a\nspecific insulator, we consider a 1D ring represented by a periodic lattice of\nN identical sites with a single value of the on-site energy. If the Bloch\nstates in the ring are expanded over a complete set of N on-site Wannier\nfunctions, the discrete on-site energy splits into the energy band. At full\nfilling, the band emulates the valence band of the band insulator and the ring\nis insulating. It carries a persistent current equal to the product of N and\nthe derivative of the on-site energy with respect to the magnetic flux. This\ncurrent is not zero if one takes into account that the on-site Wannier function\nand consequently the on-site energy of each ring site depend on magnetic flux.\nTo derive the current analytically, we expand all N Wannier functions of the\nring over the infinite basis of Wannier functions of the constituting infinite\n1D crystal and eventually determine the crystal Wannier functions by a method\nof localized atomic orbitals. Finally, we estimate the persistent current at\nfull filling in rings made of real band insulators (GaAs, Ge, InAs). The\ncurrent decays with the ring length exponentially due to the exponential decay\nof the Wannier functions. In spite of that, it can be of measurable size. \n\n"}

In\nparticular, a point-like defect in graphene may have effects in the long range.\nThis peculiarity questions the validity of using a supercell geometry in an\nattempt to explore the properties of an isolated defect. Still, this approach\nis often used in ab-initio electronic structure calculations, for instance. How\ndoes this approach converge with the size of the supercell is generally not\ntackled for the obvious reason of keeping the computational load to an\naffordable level. The present paper addresses the problem of substitutional\nnitrogen doping of graphene. DFT calculations have been performed for 9x9 and\n10x10 supercells. Although these calculations correspond to N concentrations\nthat differ by about 10%, the local densities of states on and around the\ndefects are found to depend significantly on the supercell size. Fitting the\nDFT results by a tight-binding Hamiltonian makes it possible to explore the\neffects of a random distribution of the substitutional N atoms, in the case of\nfinite concentrations, and to approach the case of an isolated impurity when\nthe concentration vanishes. The tight-binding Hamiltonian is used to calculate\nthe STM image of graphene around an isolated N atom. STM images are also\ncalculated for graphene doped with 0.5 % concentration of nitrogen. The results\nare discussed in the light of recent experimental data and the conclusions of\nthe calculations are extended to other point defects in graphene. \n\n"}

Our hypothesis is that an internal\nskeleton may have evolved from a bilaterally symmetric ancestor with an\nexternal skeleton.

This dynamics has something in common with Brownian motion (it is\ndiffusive at large scales), and also something in contrast. Specifically,\nmotility parameters such as the run speed and tumble rate depend on the local\nenvironment and hence can vary in space.

By computing the fixation probability of\na single cooperator in finite and well-mixed populations that include a fixed\nnumber of facilitators, and by using mean field analysis, we determine when\nselection promotes cooperation in the important classes of prisoner's dilemma,\nsnowdrift and stag-hunt games. In particular, we identify the circumstances\nunder which selection favors the replacement and invasion of defection by\ncooperation.

Histone\nproteins are implicated in the regulation of eukaryote genes and they carry\nnumerous reversible post-translational modifications that control DNA-protein\ninteractions and the recruitment of chromatin binding proteins.\nHeterochromatin, the transcriptionally inactive part of the genome, is densely\npacked and contains histone H3 that is methylated at Lys 9 (H3K9me). The\npropagation of H3K9me in nucleosomes along the DNA in chromatin is antagonizing\nby methylation of H3 Lysine 4 (H3K4me) and acetylations of several lysines,\nwhich is related to euchromatin and active genes. We show that the related\nhistone modifications form antagonized domains on a coarse scale.

In this paper, the question is examined\nagain, but instead of using a pre-determined lattice, the actual physical\npositions of all known star systems within 40 parsecs of the Solar System are\nused as percolation sites; in addition, the number of sites accessible for\nfurther colonization from a given system is determined by a choice of maximum\ndistance such efforts can travel across. The resulting simulations show that\nextraterrestrial colonization efforts may reach the Solar System, but only for\ncertain values of the maximum travel distance and probability of an occupied\nsystem further colonizing other systems. Indeed, large numbers of systems may\nbe colonized with either vessels that lack insufficient travel distance to\nreach the Solar System or else have a colonization probability where they are\nstatistically unlikely to reach us. \n\n"}

Insofar as sensory adaptive systems map environmental changes to changes\nof their internal degrees of freedom, they can be regarded as computational\ndevices manipulating information. Landauer established that information is\nultimately physical, and its manipulation subject to the entropic and energetic\nbounds of thermodynamics. Thus the fundamental costs of biological sensory\nadaptation can be elucidated by tracking how the information the system has\nabout its environment is altered. These bounds are particularly relevant for\nsmall organisms, which unlike everyday computers operate at very low energies.\nIn this paper, we establish a general framework for the thermodynamics of\ninformation processing in sensing.

In particular, they shown that, for local\nstabilizer codes in D spatial dimensions, locality preserving gates are\nrestricted to a set of unitary gates known as the D-th level of the Clifford\nhierarchy.

While this two-point measurement\ndefinition of quantum work can be justified heuristically by appeal to the\nfirst law of thermodynamics, its relationship to the classical definition of\nwork has not been carefully examined. In this paper we employ semiclassical\nmethods, combined with numerical simulations of a driven quartic oscillator, to\nstudy the correspondence between classical and quantal definitions of work in\nsystems with one degree of freedom. We find that a semiclassical work\ndistribution, built from classical trajectories that connect the initial and\nfinal energies, provides an excellent approximation to the quantum work\ndistribution when the trajectories are assigned suitable phases and are allowed\nto interfere. Neglecting the interferences between trajectories reduces the\ndistribution to that of the corresponding classical process. Hence, in the\nsemiclassical limit, the quantum work distribution converges to the classical\ndistribution, decorated by a quantum interference pattern. We also derive the\nform of the quantum work distribution at the boundary between classically\nallowed and forbidden regions, where this distribution tunnels into the\nforbidden region. Our results clarify how the correspondence principle applies\nin the context of quantum and classical work distributions, and contribute to\nthe understanding of work and nonequilibrium work relations in the quantum\nregime. \n\n"}

The control objective is to apply parameter\nperturbation to drive the system from one attractor to another, assuming that\nthe former is undesired and the latter is desired. To make our framework\npractically useful, we consider RESTRICTED parameter perturbation by imposing\nthe following two constraints: (a) it must be experimentally realizable and (b)\nit is applied only temporarily.

Direct reciprocity requires that\nindividuals keep track of their past interactions and find the right response.\nHowever, there are natural bounds on strategic complexity: Humans find it\ndifficult to remember past interactions accurately, especially over long\ntimespans.

However, the\nconnection between fixed points of GBP and the extremal points of the CVM\nfree-energy is usually not a one-to-one correspondence, because of the\nexistence of a gauge transformation involving the GBP messages.\n  Our contribution is twofold. Firstly we propose a new way of defining\nmessages (fields) in a generic CVM approximation, such that messages arrive on\na given region from all its ancestors, and not only from its direct parents, as\nin the standard Parent-to-Child GBP. We call this approach maximal messages.\nSecondly we focus on the case of binary variables, re-interpreting the messages\nas fields enforcing the consistency between the moments of the local (marginal)\nprobability distributions.

The values obtained outperform Bethe\nestimates, and are comparable with loop corrected Belief Propagation equations.\nThe method allows for a straightforward generalization to disordered systems. \n\n"}

The hygroscopic swelling of individual fibres and their interactions\nwithin the fibrous network govern the macroscopic response. At this scale,\nmoisture induced instabilities and out-of-plane deformations may occur. This\nwork focuses on several aspects of this issue. A macroscopic phenomenological\nhygro-mechanical model is first proposed, which aims at predicting moisture\ninduced out-of-plane deformations in paper sheets. The constitutive model is\nbased on the relation between these deformations and typical irreversible\nphenomena associated to the history of paper manufacturing, i.e. the release of\ndried-in strains. The model is used to describe bending induced by moisture\ngradients through the thickness of the sheet as well as buckling due to\nmoisture variation in the presence of mechanical constraints. The results of\nthe model show that the anisotropic sheet-level hygro-expansion has a strong\ninfluence on the instability phenomena.

Can we reliably both predict such stable states\nas well as direct and control transitions between them?

By reverting to an older,\nmore heuristic model it is shown that all of the technical difficulties are\neliminated. Application to a Lennard-Jones fluid results in a demonstration of\npower of ftDFT to describe crystallization in a highly inhomogeneous system.\nFirst, we show that droplets attached to a slightly hydrophobic wall\ncrystallize spontaneously upon being quenched.

It is shown that coherent 3D islands can be expected to\nform in compressed rather than in expanded overlayers beyond a critical lattice\nmisfit. In the latter case the classical Stranski-Krastanov growth is expected\nto occur because the misfit dislocations can become energetically favored at\nsmaller island sizes. The thermodynamic reason for coherent 3D islanding is the\nincomplete wetting owing to the weaker adhesion of the edge atoms. Monolayer\nheight islands with a critical size appear as necessary precursors of the 3D\nislands. The latter explains the experimentally observed narrow size\ndistribution of the 3D islands. The 2D-3D transformation takes place by\nconsecutive rearrangements of mono- to bilayer, bi- to trilayer islands, etc.,\nafter exceeding the corresponding critical sizes. The rearrangements are\ninitiated by nucleation events each next one requiring to overcome a lower\nenergetic barrier.

We introduce a 2-parameter family of\ngrowth patterns that interpolates between DLA and a discrete version of\nLaplacian growth. The ultraviolet putative finite-time singularities are\nregularized here by a minimal tip size, equivalently for all the models in this\nfamily. With this we stress that the difference between DLA and Laplacian\ngrowth is NOT in the manner of ultraviolet regularization, but rather in their\ndeeply different growth rules. The fractal dimensions of the asymptotic\npatterns depend continuously on the two parameters of the family, giving rise\nto a \"phase diagram\" in which DLA and discretized Laplacian growth are at the\nextreme ends. In particular we show that the fractal dimension of Laplacian\ngrowth patterns is much higher than the fractal dimension of DLA, with the\npossibility of dimension 2 for the former not excluded. \n\n"}

In the limit where\nthe number N of agents is infinite, the dynamics of the fraction of bullish\nagents is deterministic and exhibits chaotic behavior in a significant domain\nof the parameter space of the model. A typical chaotic trajectory is\ncharacterized by intermittent phases of chaos, quasi-periodic behavior and\nsuper-exponentially growing bubbles followed by crashes.

The\nagents interact locally by their individual variables: for example, people\nworking in the same office may influence their peers' expectations\n(optimism/pessimism are contagious), while people living in the same\nneighborhood may influence their peers' saving patterns (stinginess/largeness\nare contagious). Thus, for each type of variable there exists a different\nunderlying social network, which we refer to as a ``layer''. Each layer\nconnects the same set of agents by a different set of links defining a\ndifferent topology. In different layers, the nature of the variables and their\ndynamics may be different (Ising, Heisenberg, matrix models, etc). The\ndifferent variables belonging to the same agent interact (the level of optimism\nof an agent may influence its saving level), thus coupling the various layers.\nWe present a simple instance of such a network, where a one-dimensional Ising\nchain (representing the interaction between the optimist-pessimist\nexpectations) is coupled through a random site-to-site mapping to a\none-dimensional generalized Blume-Capel chain (representing the dynamics of the\nagents' saving ratios). In the absence of coupling between the layers, the\none-dimensional systems describing respectively the expectations and the saving\nratios do not feature any ordered phase (herding). Yet, such a herding phase\nemerges in the coupled system, highlighting the non-trivial nature of the\npresent framework. \n\n"}

Here we consider a quantum system consisting of a regular chain of\nelementary subsystems with nearest neighbour interactions and assume that the\ntotal system is in a canonical state with temperature $T$. We analyse, under\nwhat condition the state factors into a product of canonical density matrices\nwith respect to groups of $n$ subsystems each, and when these groups have the\nsame temperature $T$. In quantum systems the minimal group size\n$n_{\\textrm{min}}$ depends on the temperature $T$, contrary to the classical\ncase.

For such\nisostatic packings, we derive a theoretical connection between the probability\ndistribution of interparticle forces $P_{f}(f)$, which we measure\ncomputationally, and the contact contribution to $g_{2}$.

For the strongly confining coulombic atomic potentials\nin the H2 molecule, the most dramatic failure occurs at very large interatomic\ndistances, where HL predicts a triplet ground state, both in 3D and in 2D,\ncoming from the absence of electron-electron correlation effects in this\napproach.

In this paper we briefly show some properties of these complex\nnetworks of evolutionary and ecological relationships. First, we characterize\nlarge scale evolutionary relationships in the Tree of Life by a degree\ndistribution. Second, we represent genetic relationships between individuals of\na Mediterranean marine plant, Posidonia oceanica, in terms of a Minimum\nSpanning Tree. Finally, relationships among plant shoots inside populations are\nrepresented as networks of genetic similarity. \n\n"}

These codes implement the whole Clifford group of\nunitary operations in a fully topological manner and without selective\naddressing of qubits. This allows us to extend their application also to\nquantum teleportation, dense coding and computation with magic states. \n\n"}

In particular, we show how this can be achieved using brane-net\ncondensates in 3-colexes. The universal set of gates is implemented without\nselective addressing of physical qubits and, being fully topologically\nprotected, it does not rely on quasiparticle excitations or their braiding. \n\n"}
