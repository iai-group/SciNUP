Motivated by this proposal,\nwe build an explicit model of DM in the context of Weak Scale Supersymmetry\n(SUSY).

We also found that the rescattering part of the amplitude is\nrelatively large indicating an important contribution of the meson loops in the\ndetermination of the gamma-gamma total widths.

Significant efforts are underway internationally\nto use lattice QCD to directly compute properties of ground and excited-state\nbaryons. Detailed knowledge of the hadronic spectrum will provide insight into\nthe character of these states beyond what can be extracted from models.\n  In this review, I will focus on the latest progress in lattice calculations\nof the $P_{11}(1440)$, the poorly known hyperon spectrum and the energies of\nhighly-excited states of the nucleon, Delta and other light-flavor baryons. In\nthe heavy-flavor sector, I will concentrate on recent lattice-QCD calculations\nof baryon masses, particularly those that make predictions concerning\nyet-to-be-discovered baryons, such as $\\Omega_{cc}$, $\\Xi^\\prime_b$ or\ntriply-heavy baryons. \n\n"}

It is empirically known to be\ndifficult to access low temperature and nonzero chemical potential $\\mu$\nregions in lattice QCD simulations. We address this issue in a lattice QCD with\nthe use of a dimensional reduction formula of the fermion determinant.\n  We investigate spectral properties of a reduced matrix of the reduction\nformula. Lattice simulations with different lattice sizes show that the\neigenvalues of the reduced matrix follow a scaling law for the temporal size\n$N_t$. The properties of the fermion determinant are examined using the\nreduction formula. We find that as a consequence of the $N_t$ scaling law, the\nfermion determinant becomes insensitive to $\\mu$ as $T$ decreases, and\n$\\mu$-independent at T=0 for $\\mu<m_\\pi/2$.\n  The $N_t$ scaling law provides two types of the low temperature limit of the\nfermion determinant: (i) for low density and (ii) for high-density. The fermion\ndeterminant becomes real and the theory is free from the sign problem in both\ncases. In case of (ii), QCD approaches to a theory, where quarks interact only\nin spatial directions, and gluons interact via the ordinary Yang-Mills action.\nThe partition function becomes exactly $Z_3$ invariant even in the presence of\ndynamical quarks because of the absence of the temporal interaction of quarks.\n  The reduction formula is also applied to the canonical formalism and Lee-Yang\nzero theorem. We find characteristic temperature dependences of the canonical\ndistribution and of Lee-Yang zero trajectory. Using an assumption on the\ncanonical partition function, we discuss physical meaning of those temperature\ndependences and show that the change of the canonical distribution and Lee-Yang\nzero trajectory are related to the existence/absence of $\\mu$-induced phase\ntransitions. \n\n"}

The main ingredient of this formalism is the dynamical formation of\nbound-states with vanishing mass, which give rise to effective vertices\ncontaining massless poles; these latter vertices, in turn, trigger the\nSchwinger mechanism, and allow for the gauge-invariant generation of an\neffective gluon mass. This particular approach has the conceptual advantage of\nrelating the gluon mass directly to quantities that are intrinsic to the\nbound-state formation itself, such as the \"transition amplitude\" and the\ncorresponding \"bound-state wave-function\". As a result, the dynamical evolution\nof the gluon mass is largely determined by a Bethe-Salpeter equation that\ncontrols the dynamics of the relevant wave-function, rather than the\nSchwinger-Dyson equation of the gluon propagator, as happens in the standard\ntreatment. The precise structure and field-theoretic properties of the\ntransition amplitude are scrutinized in a variety of independent ways. In\nparticular, a parallel study within the linear covariant (Landau) gauge and the\nbackground-field method reveals that a powerful identity, known to be valid at\nthe level of conventional Green's functions, relates also the background and\nquantum transition amplitudes. Despite the differences in the ingredients and\nterminology employed, the massless bound-state formalism is absolutely\nequivalent to the standard approach based on Schwinger-Dyson equations.

A high Reynolds number ensures strong coupling between\nmagnetic field and fluid motions. The subsequent evolution of the magnetic\nfield is governed by decaying hydromagnetic turbulence. Both our numerical\nsimulations and a phenomenological description allow us to recover \"universal\"\nlaws for the decay of magnetic energy and the growth of magnetic correlation\nlength in the turbulent (low viscosity) regime.

One of the most intriguing issues is whether or not the\nanomalous U(1) symmetry in the flavor sector is effectively restored along with\nthe chiral symmetry. This may determine the universality class of the chiral\nphase transition. Since the physics near the chiral phase transition is\nessentially non-perturbative, we employ first principles lattice techniques to\naddress this issue. We use overlap fermions, which have exact chiral symmetry\non the lattice, to probe the anomalous U(1) symmetry violation of 2+1 flavor\ndynamical QCD configurations with domain wall fermions. The latter also\noptimally preserves chiral and flavor symmetries on the lattice, since it is\nknown that the remnant chiral symmetry of the light quarks influences the\nscaling of the chiral condensate in the crossover transition region.

Abstract: We consider idealized parton shower event generators that treat parton spin\nand color exactly, leaving aside the choice of practical approximations for\nspin and color.

We argue that a parton shower\nwith splitting functions proportional to $\\alpha_s$ can be viewed not just as a\nmodel, but as the lowest order approximation to a shower that is defined at any\nperturbative order. To support this argument, we present a formulation for a\nparton shower at order $\\alpha_s ^k$ for any $k$. Since some of the input\nfunctions needed are specified by their properties but not calculated, this\nformulation does not provide a useful recipe for an order $\\alpha_s ^k$ parton\nshower algorithm. However, in this formulation we see how the operators that\ngenerate the shower are related to operators that specify the infrared\nsingularities of QCD. \n\n"}

In particular, the production of\ncharged particles from DM annihilation in astrophysical systems that contain\nmagnetic fields yields radio emission through synchrotron radiation and X-ray\nemission through inverse Compton scattering of ambient photons. We introduce\nRX-DMFIT, a tool used for calculating the expected secondary emission from DM\nannihilation. RX-DMFIT includes a wide range of customizable astrophysical and\nparticle parameters and incorporates important astrophysics including the\ndiffusion of charged particles, relevant radiative energy losses, and magnetic\nfield modelling. We demonstrate the use and versatility of RX-DMFIT by\nanalyzing the potential radio and X-ray signals for a variety of DM particle\nmodels and astrophysical environments including galaxy clusters, dwarf\nspheroidal galaxies and normal galaxies. We then apply RX-DMFIT to a concrete\nexample using Segue I radio data to place constraints for a range of assumed DM\nannihilation channels. For WIMP models with $M_{\\chi} \\leq 100$ GeV and\nassuming weak diffusion, we find that the the leptonic $\\mu^+\\mu^-$ and\n$\\tau^+\\tau^-$ final states provide the strongest constraints, placing limits\non the DM particle cross-section well below the thermal relic cross-section,\nwhile even for the $b\\bar{b}$ channel we find limits close to the thermal relic\ncross-section.

The predicted light nuclear abundances are most\nsensitive to the neutron-proton mass splitting as both the initial relative\nabundance of neutrons to protons and the $n \\rightleftharpoons p$ weak reaction\nrates are very sensitive to this quantity. Lattice QCD has been used to\ndetermine this mass splitting to greater than 5-sigma, including contributions\nfrom both the down-quark up-quark mass splitting, $2\\delta = m_d-m_u$ and from\nelectromagnetic coupling of the quarks to the photons with a strength governed\nby the fine structure constant, $\\alpha_{fs}$. At leading order in isospin\nbreaking, the contribution of $\\delta$ and $\\alpha_{fs}$ to $M_n-M_p$ and the\nnuclear reaction rates can be varied independently. We use this knowledge and\ninput from lattice QCD to quantitatively study variations of the predicted\nlight nuclear abundances as $\\delta$ and $\\alpha_{fs}$ are varied. The change\nin the D and ${}^4$He abundances individually allow for potentially large\nsimultaneous variations in $\\delta$ and $\\alpha_{fs}$ while maintaining\nconsistency with the observed abundances, however the combined comparison\nrestricts variations in these sources of isospin breaking to less than\n$\\lesssim1.25\\%$ at the 3-sigma confidence level.

They are much simpler to\nsimulate than the original lattice model and are affected by a milder sign\nproblem, but it is not clear to which extent they really capture the rich\nspectrum of the original theories. We propose here a simple way to address this\nissue based on the so called second moment correlation length $\\xi_{2nd}$. The\nratio $\\xi/\\xi_{2nd}$ between the exponential correlation length and the second\nmoment one is equal to 1 if only a single mass is present in the spectrum, and\nit becomes larger and larger as the complexity of the spectrum increases. Since\nboth $\\xi$ and $\\xi_{2nd}$ are easy to measure on the lattice, this is a cheap\nand efficient way to keep track of the spectrum of the theory.

A very\nsimilar physical picture can be used to describe QCD states containing heavy\nquarks as well as light-quarks or gluonic excitations. In this work, we derive\nthe Born--Oppenheimer approximation for QED molecular systems in an effective\nfield theory framework by sequentially integrating out degrees of freedom\nliving at energies above the typical energy scale where the dynamics of the\nheavy degrees of freedom occurs. In particular, we compute the matching\ncoefficients of the effective field theory for the case of the $H^+_2$ diatomic\nmolecule that are relevant to compute its spectrum up to ${\\cal O}(m\\alpha^5)$.\nUltrasoft photon loops contribute at this order, being ultimately responsible\nfor the molecular Lamb shift.

It also may serve as a schematic model for\ndisorder in quantum systems. In this review, we discuss both types of\napplications of chiral random matrix theory to the QCD partition function. We\nshow that constraints imposed by chiral symmetry and its spontaneous breaking\ndetermine the structure of low-energy effective partition functions for the\nDirac spectrum. We thus derive exact results for the low-lying eigenvalues of\nthe QCD Dirac operator. We argue that the statistical properties of these\neigenvalues are universal and can be described by a random matrix theory with\nthe global symmetries of the QCD partition function. The total number of such\neigenvalues increases with the square root of the Euclidean four-volume. The\nspectral density for larger eigenvalues (but still well below a typical\nhadronic mass scale) also follows from the same low-energy effective partition\nfunction. The validity of the random matrix approach has been confirmed by many\nlattice QCD simulations in a wide parameter range. Stimulated by the success of\nthe chiral random matrix theory in the description of universal properties of\nthe Dirac eigenvalues, the random matrix model is extended to nonzero\ntemperature and chemical potential. In this way we obtain qualitative results\nfor the QCD phase diagram and the spectrum of the QCD Dirac operator.

Each model has a single free parameter,\nexhibits behavior similar to lattice simulations over the range T_d - 5T_d, and\nhas the correct blackbody behavior for large temperatures. The N = 2\ndeconfinement transition is second order in both models, while N = 3,4, and 5\nare first order. Both models appear to have a smooth large-N limit. For N >= 4,\nit is shown that the trace of the Polyakov loop is insufficient to characterize\nthe phase structure; the free energy is best described using the eigenvalues of\nthe Polyakov loop. In both models, the confined phase is characterized by a\nmutual repulsion of Polyakov loop eigenvalues that makes the Polyakov loop\nexpectation value zero. In the deconfined phase, the rotation of the\neigenvalues in the complex plane towards 1 is responsible for the approach to\nthe blackbody limit over the range T_d - 5T_d.

The nicest\nfeature is that gauge symmetry itself protects the Higgs potential from\ndivergences, thus potentially curing the hierarchy problem in the Standard\nModel. In a flat space model tree-level contributions to electroweak precision\nobservables will be absent due to the flatness of the gauge and Higgs wave\nfunctions. The Higgs potential is fully radiatively generated and the\ncontribution of bulk fermions will induce a vacuum expectation value. A generic\nproblem is that the quartic scalar coupling is too low, resulting in a Higgs\nVEV that is too close to the compactification scale, and a Higgs mass that is\ntoo light. In this paper we show that it is possible to solve these problems in\na minimal scenario by cancellations in the Higgs potential between the\ncontribution of different bulk fermions. A crucial role is played by\nantiperiodic fermions: the cancellation is not the result of a fine tuning, but\nrather dictated by the choice of representations and parities of the fermions.\nWe also show that introducing a relatively large representation can help in\nachieving a sufficiently heavy top.

We\nfind that the fundamental string scale, together with all compact dimensions,\ncan be at the TeV, while the smallness of the string coupling accounts for the\nweakness of gravitational interactions. This is in contrast to the situation\nrecently studied in type I theories, where the string scale can be lowered only\nat the expense of introducing large transverse dimensions felt by gravity only.\nAs a result, in these type II strings, there are no strong gravity effects at\nthe TeV, and the main experimental signature is the production of Kaluza-Klein\nexcitations with gauge interactions. In the context of type IIB theories, we\nfind a new possibility providing a first instance of large non-transverse\ndimensions at weak coupling: two of the internal dimensions seen by gauge\ninteractions can be at the TeV, with the string scale and all other dimensions\nat intermediate energies of the order of $10^{11}$ GeV, where gravity becomes\nalso strong. Finally, using duality, we provide a perturbative description for\nthe generic case of large dimensions in the heterotic string.

With recent advances in the calculation\nof hadron masses within full QCD, it is of interest to see whether the sigma\ncommutator can be calculated directly from the dependence of the nucleon mass\non the input quark mass.
