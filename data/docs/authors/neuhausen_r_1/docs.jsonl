Although the stability of the operator product expansion side seems\nto break down at T > 1.06Tc for the vector channel and T>1.04Tc for the\npseudoscalar channel, we find a sudden change of the spectral property across\nthe critical temperature Tc, which originates from an equally rapid change of\nthe scalar gluon condensate characterized by e-3p.

I demonstrate that\nunder quite natural assumptions about the dynamics of heavy ion collisions this\nleads to a universal (i.e. independent of the initial parton energy, but\ndependent on flavor and centrality) upper bound on the energy of the partons\nescaping from the plasma. This bound is a Yang--Mills analog of the Pomeranchuk\nbound in classical electrodynamics, where it is a consequence of radiation in a\nstrong external field acting on a relativistic charge.

This hybrid approach is based on the Ultra-relativistic\nQuantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD) transport approach with an intermediate\nhydrodynamical evolution for the hot and dense stage of the collision.\nEvent-by-event fluctuations are directly taken into account via the\nnon-equilibrium initial conditions generated by the initial collisions and\nstring fragmentations in the microscopic UrQMD model. After a (3+1)-dimensional\nideal hydrodynamic evolution, the hydrodynamical fields are mapped to hadrons\nvia the Cooper-Frye equation and the subsequent hadronic cascade calculation\nwithin UrQMD proceeds to incorporate the important final state effects for a\nrealistic freeze-out. This implementation allows to compare pure microscopic\ntransport calculations with hydrodynamic calculations using exactly the same\ninitial conditions and freeze-out procedure. The effects of the change in the\nunderlying dynamics - ideal fluid dynamics vs. non-equilibrium transport theory\n- will be explored. The freeze-out and initial state parameter dependences are\ninvestigated for different observables. Furthermore, the time evolution of the\nbaryon density and particle yields are discussed. We find that the final pion\nand proton multiplicities are lower in the hybrid model calculation due to the\nisentropic hydrodynamic expansion while the yields for strange particles are\nenhanced due to the local equilibrium in the hydrodynamic evolution.

New experimental data on nucleon spin\nstructure at low to intermediate momentum transfers combined with existing high\nmomentum transfer data offer a comprehensive picture in the strong region of\nthe interaction and of the transition region from the strong to the\nasymptotic-free region. Insight for some aspects of the theory for the strong\ninteraction, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), is gained by exploring lower moments\nof spin structure functions and their corresponding sum rules. These moments\nare expressed in terms of an operator-product expansion using quark and gluon\ndegrees of freedom at moderately large momentum transfers. The higher-twist\ncontributions have been examined through the evolution of these moments as the\nmomentum transfer varies from higher to lower values. Furthermore, QCD-inspired\nlow-energy effective theories, which explicitly include chiral symmetry\nbreaking, are tested at low momentum transfers.

The bulk contribution to NST arises\nfrom an extended sharp radius of neutrons, whereas the surface contribution\narises from different widths of the neutron and proton surfaces. Nuclear models\nwhere the symmetry energy is stiff, as typical relativistic models, predict a\nbulk contribution in NST of 208Pb about twice as large as the surface\ncontribution. In contrast, models with a soft symmetry energy like common\nnonrelativistic models predict that NST of 208Pb is divided similarly into bulk\nand surface parts.

Second, tensor-polarized quark and antiquark distributions are\nobtained by analyzing HERMES measurements on the structure function b_1 for the\ndeuteron.

In\ncontrasting this behaviour with that produced by a momentum-dependent\ninteraction, one achieves comparisons which highlight that elastic scattering\nand resonance electroproduction experiments probe the infrared evolution of\nQCD's running masses; e.g., the existence, and location if so, of a zero in the\nratio of nucleon Sachs form factors are strongly influenced by the running of\nthe dressed-quark mass. In our description of baryons, diquark correlations are\nimportant. These correlations are instrumental in producing a zero in the Dirac\nform factor of the proton's d-quark; and in determining d_v/u_v(x=1), as we\nshow via a formula that expresses d_v/u_v(x=1) in terms of the nucleon's\ndiquark content. The contact interaction produces a first excitation of the\nnucleon that is constituted predominantly from axial-vector diquark\ncorrelations.

Modification of\nheavy-flavor production in heavy-ion collisions relative to binary-collision\nscaling from p+p results, quantified with the nuclear-modification factor\n(R_AA), provides information on both cold- and hot-nuclear-matter effects.\n  Purpose: Determine transverse-momentum, pt, spectra and the corresponding\nR_AA for muons from heavy-flavor mesons decay in p+p and Cu+Cu collisions at\nsqrt(s_NN)=200 GeV and y=1.65.\n  Method: Results are obtained using the semi-leptonic decay of heavy-flavor\nmesons into negative muons.

{"id": "1209.2477", "contents": "Title: The EMC Effect and Short-Range Correlations Abstract: We overview the progress made in studies of EMC and short range correlation\n(SRC) effects with the special emphasis given to the recent observation of the\ncorrelation between the slope of the EMC ratio at Bjorken x<1 and the scale\nfactor of the same ratio at x>1 that measures the strength of the SRCs in\nnuclei. This correlation may indicate the larger modification of nucleons with\nhigher momentum thus making the nucleon virtuality as the most relevant\nparameter of medium modifications. To check this conjecture we study the\nimplication of several properties of high momentum component of the nuclear\nwave function on the characteristics of EMC effect. We observe two main reasons\nfor the EMC-SRC correlation: first, the decrease of the contribution from the\nnuclear mean field due to the increase, with A, the fraction of the high\nmomentum component of nuclear wave function. Second, the increase of the medium\nmodification of nucleons in SRC. Our main prediction however is the increase of\nthe proton contribution to the EMC effect for large A asymmetric nuclei. This\nprediction is based on the recent observation of the strong dominance of pn\nSRCs in the high momentum component of nuclear wave function. Our preliminary\ncalculation based on this prediction of the excess of energetic and modified\nprotons in large A nuclei describes reasonably well the main features of the\nobserved EMC-SRC correlation. \n\n"}

The geometric correlations (i) are due to the fact\nthat nucleons are correlated by simply being confined within the same nucleus\nand may lead to long-range rapidity correlations for the produced particles\nwithout strong azimuthal angle dependence.

Predictions of 146Sm and 144Sm\nproduction in the gamma-process in massive stars are at odds with these\nconstraints and this is partly due to deficiences in the prediction of the\nreaction rates involved.

These degeneracies cannot be broken by the CMB constraint on the\neffective number of neutrinos, N_eff. However, since big bang nucleosynthesis\n(BBN) is also affected by a light WIMP and equivalent neutrinos, complementary\nBBN and CMB constraints can break some of the degeneracy.

In this paper BBN predictions with a light WIMP\nthat only couples to neutrinos are calculated. Recent observed abundances of\n^2H and ^4He are used to limit m_chi, Delta N_nu, N_eff, and the present-day\nbaryon density. Allowing for a neutrino coupled light WIMP and nonzero Delta\nN_nu, combined BBN and CMB data give lower limits to m_chi, with a best fit\nm_chi > 35 MeV, equivalent to no light WIMP at all. All masses below 4--9 MeV\n(depending on spin) are excluded. Without any light WIMP, BBN alone prefers\nDelta N_nu = 0.50 +- 0.23, favoring neither Delta N_nu = 0, nor a fully\nthermalized sterile neutrino (Delta N_nu = 1).

The ratios of jet spectra from\ndifferent centrality selections show a strong modification of jet production at\nall $p_\\mathrm{T}$ at forward rapidities and for large $p_\\mathrm{T}$ at\nmid-rapidity, which manifests as a suppression of the jet yield in central\nevents and an enhancement in peripheral events.

There is little systematic knowledge of the contribution\nof collective excitations to the interaction between nuclei, particularly in\nthe overlap region of heavy nuclei.\n  Purpose: To study the dynamic polarization potential (DPP) generated by\nchannel coupling that had been validated for a case where scattering is\nsensitive to the nuclear potential over a wide radial range; to exhibit\nevidence of the non-locality due to collective coupling; to validate, or\notherwise, the representation of DPPs by uniform renormalization of potentials.\n  Methods: S-matrix to potential inversion yields local potentials reproducing\nthe elastic channel S-matrix of coupled channel calculations. Subtracting the\nelastic channel uncoupled potential yields a local L-independent representation\nof the DPP. The dependence of the DPP on the nature of the coupled states and\nother parameters can be studied.\n  Results: Local DPPs were found due to the excitation of C-12 and the combined\nexcitation of O-16 and C-12. The radial forms found were very different from\nuniform renormalization of the potential. Full coupling led to a 10 percent\nincrease in the volume integral of the real potential. Evidence for the\nnon-locality of the underlying formal DPP and the effect of direct coupling\nbetween the collective states is found.\n  Conclusions: The local DPP generating the secondary rainbow is found.

The states are generated by means\nof the isospin and angular-momentum projection applied to a set of low-lying\n(multi)particle-(multi)hole deformed Slater determinants calculated using the\nself-consistent Skyrme-Hartree-Fock approach.\n  [Results] The theory is applied to calculate energy spectra in N~Z nuclei\nthat are relevant from the point of view of a study of superallowed Fermi\nbeta-decays. In particular, a new set of the isospin-symmetry-breaking\ncorrections to these decays is given.\n  [Conclusions] It is demonstrated that the NCCI model is capable to capture\nmain features of low-lying energy spectra in light and medium-mass nuclei using\nrelatively small model space and without any local readjustment of its\nlow-energy coupling constants.

Theoretical Framework Abstract: We develop a theoretical approach for nuclear spectral functions at high\nmissing momenta and removal energies based on the multi-nucleon short-range\ncorrelation~(SRC) model. The approach is based on the effective Feynman\ndiagrammatic method which allows to account for the relativistic effects\nimportant in the SRC domain. In addition to two-nucleon SRC with center of mass\nmotion we derive also the contribution of three-nucleon SRCs to the nuclear\nspectral functions. The latter is modeled based on the assumption that 3N SRCs\nare a product of two sequential short range NN interactions. This approach\nallowed us to express the 3N SRC part of the nuclear spectral function as a\nconvolution of two NN SRCs. Thus the knowledge of 2N SRCs allows us to model\nboth two- and three-nucleon SRC contributions to the spectral function. The\nderivations of the spectral functions are based on the two theoretical\nframeworks in evaluating covariant Feynman diagrams: In the first, referred as\nvirtual nucleon approximation, we reduce Feynman diagrams to the time ordered\nnoncovariant diagrams by evaluating nucleon spectators in the SRC at their\npositive energy poles, neglecting explicitly the contribution from vacuum\ndiagrams. In the second approach, referred as light-front approximation, we\nformulate the boost invariant nuclear spectral function in the light-front\nreference frame in which case the vacuum diagrams are generally suppressed and\nthe bound nucleon is described by its light-cone variables such as momentum\nfraction, transverse momentum and invariant mass. \n\n"}

They consist of a core and one or a few nucleons which spend most of\ntheir time in the classically-forbidden region outside the range of the\ninteraction. Individual nucleons inside the core are thus unresolved in the\nhalo configuration, and the low-energy effective interactions are short-range\nforces between the core and the valence nucleons. Similar phenomena occur in\nclusters of $^4$He atoms, cold atomic gases near a Feshbach resonance, and some\nexotic hadrons. In these weakly-bound quantum systems universal scaling laws\nfor s-wave binding emerge that are independent of the details of the\ninteraction. Effective field theory (EFT) exposes these correlations and\npermits the calculation of non-universal corrections to them due to\nshort-distance effects, as well as the extension of these ideas to systems\ninvolving the Coulomb interaction and/or binding in higher angular-momentum\nchannels. Halo nuclei exhibit all these features. Halo EFT, the EFT for halo\nnuclei, has been used to compute the properties of single-neutron, two-neutron,\nand single-proton halos of s-wave and p-wave type. This review summarizes these\nresults for halo binding energies, radii, Coulomb dissociation, and radiative\ncapture, as well as the connection of these properties to scattering\nparameters, thereby elucidating the universal correlations between all these\nobservables.

Using a Glauber-based independent source model, we study the\ninfluence of CF on several distributions of multiplicity $N$ and eccentricities\n$\\epsilon_n$: $p(N)$, $p(\\epsilon_n)$, $p(\\epsilon_n,\\epsilon_m)$ and\n$p(N,\\epsilon_n)$, where the effects of CF is quantified using multi-particle\ncumulants of these distributions. In mid-central collisions, a general relation\nis established between the multiplicity fluctuation and resulting CF in the\nreference subevent. In ultra-central collisions, where distribution of particle\nproduction sources is strongly distorted, we find these cumulants exhibit rich\nsign-change patterns, due to observable-dependent non-Gaussianity in the\nunderlying distributions.

While the HBT radii oscillations relative\nto the second harmonic event plane measured recently reflect mostly the spatial\ngeometry of the source, model studies have shown that the HBT radii\noscillations relative to the third harmonic event plane are predominantly\ndefined by the velocity fields.

We suggest a method to\nconstruct prior distributions for model defects for reaction models using\nneighboring isotopes of $^{56}$Fe as an example. A model defect is usually a\nfunction of energy and describes the difference between the model prediction\nand the truth. Of course, neither the truth nor the model defect are\naccessible. A Gaussian process (GP) enables to define a probability\ndistribution on possible shapes of a model defect by referring to intuitively\nunderstandable concepts such as smoothness and the expected magnitude of the\ndefect. Standard specifications of GPs impose a typical length-scale and\namplitude valid for the whole energy range, which is often not justified, e.g.,\nwhen the model covers both the resonance and statistical range. In this\ncontribution, we show how a GP with energy-dependent length-scales and\namplitudes can be constructed from available experimental data. The proposed\nconstruction is inspired by a technique called dynamic time warping used, e.g.,\nfor speech recognition. We demonstrate the feasibility of the data-driven\ndetermination of model defects by inferring a model defect of the nuclear\nmodels code TALYS for (n,p) reactions of isotopes with charge number between 20\nand 30.

Some examples\nare strongly interacting medium and heavy mass atomic nuclei and mesoscopic\ncondensed matter systems. In this approach, the linear Schrodinger equation for\nthe exact many-body wave function is mapped onto a non-linear density-dependent\none-body potential problem. This approximation, not only provides\ncomputationally very simple solutions even for systems with many particles, but\ndue to the non-linearity, it also allows for obtaining solutions that break\nessential symmetries of the system, often connected with phase transitions. In\nthis way, additional correlations are subsumed in the system. However, the\nmean-field approach suffers from the drawback that the corresponding wave\nfunctions do not have sharp quantum numbers and, therefore, many results cannot\nbe compared directly with experimental data. In this article, we discuss\ngeneral group-theory techniques to restore the broken symmetries, and provide\ndetailed expressions on the restoration of translational, rotational, spin,\nisospin, parity and gauge symmetries, where the latter corresponds to the\nrestoration of the particle number. In order to avoid the numerical complexity\nof exact projection techniques, various approximation methods available in the\nliterature are examined.

Abstract: We show that uncertainties in the values of the surface heavy element\nabundances of the Sun are the largest source of the theoretical uncertainty in\ncalculating the p-p, pep, 8B, 13N, 15O, and 17F solar neutrino fluxes. We\nevaluate for the first time the sensitivity (partial derivative) of each solar\nneutrino flux with respect to the surface abundance of each element. We then\ncalculate the uncertainties in each neutrino flux using `conservative\n(preferred)' and `optimistic' estimates for the uncertainties in the element\nabundances. The total conservative (optimistic) composition uncertainty in the\npredicted 8B neutrino flux is 11.6% (5.0%) when sensitivities to individual\nelement abundances are used. The traditional method that lumps all abundances\ninto a single quantity (total heavy element to hydrogen ratio, Z/X) yields a\nlarger uncertainty, 20%. The uncertainties in the carbon, oxygen, neon,\nsilicon, sulphur, and iron abundances all make significant contributions to the\nuncertainties in calculating solar neutrino fluxes; the uncertainties of\ndifferent elements are most important for different neutrino fluxes.

From the effective potential for the Polyakov loop, its mass\njust below the confinement temperature T_c is in between the vacuum masses of\nthe pion and that of the kaon. Therefore, due to phase-space restrictions the\nnumber of produced kaons is roughly an order of magnitude smaller than that of\nproduced pions, in agreement with recent results from collisions of gold ions\nat the BNL-RHIC. From its mass, we estimate that the Polyakov loop condensate\nis characterized by a (spatial) correlation scale of 1/m_\\ell ~ 1/2 fm.

Measuring the elliptic flow of charmed hadrons, which are believed to\noriginate rather from fragmentation than from coalescence processes, might\ntherefore change our view of hadron production in heavy ion collisions.\n  While direct v_2 measurements of charmed hadrons are currently not available,\nsingle electron v_2 at sufficiently high transverse momenta can serve as a\nsubstitute. At transverse momenta above 2 GeV/c, the production of single\nelectrons from non-photonic sources is expected to be dominated by the decay of\ncharmed hadrons.

The possible connection between the presence of a\nfluctuation peak and the occurrence of a phase transition or a critical\nphenomenon is critically analyzed. Many different phenomena can lead both to\nthe creation and to the suppression of a fluctuation peak. In particular, the\nrole of constraints due to conservation laws and to data sorting is shown to be\nessential. From the experimental point of view, a comparison of the available\nfragmentation data reveals that there is a good agreement between different\ndata sets of basic fluctuation observables, if the fragmenting source is of\ncomparable size. This compatibility suggests that the fragmentation process is\nlargely independent of the reaction mechanism (central versus peripheral\ncollisions, symmetric versus asymmetric systems, light ions versus heavy ion\ninduced reactions).

We study the sensitivity of this\nconclusion to different hydrodynamic assumptions on chemical and thermal\nfreezeout after the sQGP hadronizes. We show that if chemical freezeout occurs\nat the hadronization time, the differential elliptic flow for pions increase\nwith proper time in the late hadronic phase until thermal freezeout and leads\nto a discrepancy with the data. In contrast, if both chemical and thermal\nequilibrium are maintained past the hadronization, then the mean pT per pion\nincreases in a way that accidentally preserves v2(pT) from the sQGP phase in\nagreement with the data, but at the cost of the agreement with the hadronic\nyields. In order that all the data on hadronic ratios, radial flow, and\ndifferential elliptic flow be reproduced, the sQGP must expand with a minimal\nviscosity, \\eta_Q, that is however even greater than the viscosity, \\eta_H, of\nits hadronic corona. However, because of the large entropy density difference\nof the two phases of QCD matter, the larger viscosity in the sQGP phase leads\nto nearly perfect fluid flow while the smaller entropy density of the hadronic\ncorona strongly hinders the applicability of Euler hydrodynamics. The ``perfect\nfluid'' property of the sQGP is thus not due to a sudden reduction of the\nviscosity at the critical temperature Tc, but to a sudden increase of the\nentropy density of QCD matter and is therefore an important signature of\ndeconfinement. \n\n"}

The signal\nshould be observable even if multiple domains of D$\\chi$C form provided the\naverage number of pions per domain is significantly larger than unity. The\nvariance of the number charged pions alone provides a signal which can be used\neven if the number of neutral pions cannot be measured in a given detector. On\nthe other hand, the probability distribution in $R$, the proportion of neutral\npions to all pions emitted in heavy ion collisions in certain kinematic\nregions, has been suggested as a signal of a disoriented chiral condensate.\nHere we note that the signature can be greatly enhanced by making suitable cuts\nin the data.
