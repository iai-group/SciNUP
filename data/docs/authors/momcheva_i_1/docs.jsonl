We obtain dust-corrected SFRs by fitting the GALEX (UV) and SDSS\n(optical) photometry to a library of population synthesis models that include\ndust attenuation. For star-forming galaxies, our UV-based SFRs compare\nremarkably well with those derived from SDSS H alpha. Deviations from perfect\nagreement between these two methods are due to differences in the dust\nattenuation estimates. In contrast to H alpha, UV provides reliable SFRs for\ngalaxies with weak or no H alpha emission, and where H alpha is contaminated\nwith an emission from an AGN. We use full-SED SFRs to calibrate a simple\nprescription that uses GALEX UV magnitudes to produce good SFRs for normal\nstar-forming galaxies. The specific SFR is considered as a function of stellar\nmass for (1) star-forming galaxies with no AGN, (2) those hosting an AGN, and\nfor (3) galaxies without H alpha emission. We find that the three have distinct\nstar formation histories, with AGN lying intermediate between the star-forming\nand the quiescent galaxies. Normal star forming galaxies (without an AGN) lie\non a relatively narrow linear sequence. Remarkably, galaxies hosting a strong\nAGN appear to represent the massive continuation of this sequence. Weak AGN,\nwhile also massive, have lower SFR, sometimes extending to the realm of\nquiescent galaxies. We propose an evolutionary sequence for massive galaxies\nthat smoothly connects normal star-forming galaxies to quiescent (red sequence)\ngalaxies via strong and weak AGN. We confirm that some galaxies with no H alpha\nemission show signs of SF in the UV.

This interpretation is supported by the Butcher-Oemler effect.\n  We investigate E+A galaxies as an intermediate state between late-type\ngalaxies in low density environments and early-type galaxies in high density\nenvironment to constrain the possible transformation processes.

GCs beginning their\nformation have an initial metallicity determined by the pre-enrichment of their\nsurrounding protocloud, but can also undergo internal self-enrichment during\nformation. Stochastic variations in metallicity arise because of the finite\nnumbers of supernova. We construct an analytic formulation of the combined\neffects of pre-enrichment and self-enrichment and use Monte Carlo models to\nverify that the model accurately encapsulates the mean metallicity and\nmetallicity spread among real GCs. The predicted metallicity spread due to\nself-enrichment alone, a robust prediction of the model, is much smaller than\nthe observed spread among real GCs. This result rules out self-enrichment as a\nsignificant contributor to the metal content in most GCs, leaving\npre-enrichment as the viable alternative. Self-enrichment can, however, be\nimportant for clusters with masses well above 10^6 Msun, which are massive\nenough to hold in a significant fraction of their SN ejecta even without any\nexternal pressure confinement. This transition point corresponds well to the\nmass at which a mass-metallicity relationship (\"blue tilt\") appears in the\nmetal-poor cluster sequence in many large galaxies.

The imaging is complemented by a recent wide field\nredshift survey of the cluster conducted with Hectospec on the 6.5m MMT. Among\nthe many scientific applications for this data are the search for compact\ngalaxies. In this paper, we present the discovery of seven compact (but quite\nluminous) stellar systems, ranging from M32-like galaxies down to ultra-compact\ndwarfs (UCDs)/dwarf to globular transition objects (DGTOs). We find that all\nseven compact galaxies require a two-component fit to their light profile and\nhave measured velocity dispersions that exceed those expected for typical\nearly-type galaxies at their luminosity. From our structural parameter analysis\nwe conclude that three of the sample should be classified as compact\nellipticals or M32-like galaxies, the remaining four being less extreme\nsystems. The three compact ellipticals are all found to have old luminosity\nweighted ages (> 12 Gyr), intermediate metallicities (-0.6 < [Fe/H] < -0.1) and\nhigh [Mg/Fe] (> 0.25). Our findings support a tidal stripping scenario as the\nformation mode of compact galaxies covering the luminosity range studied here.\nWe speculate that at least two early-type morphologies may serve as the\nprogenitor of compact galaxies in clusters. \n\n"}

If this is interpreted as an age\nspread, the multiple populations are separated by a few hundred Myr, which\nwould call into question the long held notion that clusters are simple stellar\npopulations. Here we show that stellar rotation in stars with masses between\n1.2-1.7 Msun can mimic the effect of a double or multiple population, whereas\nin actuality only a single population exists. The two main causes of the spread\nnear the turn-off are the effects of stellar rotation on the structure of the\nstar and the inclination angle of the star relative to the observer. Both\neffects change the observed effective temperature, hence colour, and flux of\nthe star. In order to match observations, the required rotation rates are\n20-50% of the critical rotation, which are consistent with observed rotation\nrates of similar mass stars in the Galaxy. We provide scaling relations which\ncan be applied to non-rotating isochrones in order to mimic the effects of\nrotation.

Using one\nof the deepest large public near-IR surveys to date, we investigate in detail\nthe correlations between star formation and galaxy structural parameters (size,\nstellar mass, and surface density) from z=2 to the present. At all redshifts,\nmassive quiescent galaxies (i.e. those with little or no star formation) occupy\nthe extreme high end of the surface density distribution and follow a tight\nmass-size correlation, while star-forming galaxies show a broad range of both\ndensities and sizes.

The second is that at a given redshift, the fraction of\nhost-galaxy light in the fiber increases with decreasing galaxy luminosity. We\nillustrate the latter effect using the Kormendy et al.

With allowance for the two effects, we obtain a black hole\nmass - bulge luminosity relationship for AGNs which has a scatter of only +/-\n0.23 dex in mass.

The\nsample spans a large range in velocity dispersion (sigma from 30-300 km/s) and\nin luminosity (M_R from -18.7 to -23.2). Estimates of age, total metallicity\n(Z/H) and alpha-element abundance ratio (a/Fe) were derived from\nabsorption-line analysis, using single-burst models. Age, Z/H and a/Fe are all\ncorrelated positively with velocity dispersion, but we also find significant\nresidual trends with luminosity: at given sigma, the brighter galaxies are\nyounger, less alpha-enriched, and have higher Z/H. At face value, these results\nmight suggest that the stellar populations depend on stellar mass as well as on\nvelocity dispersion. However, we show that the observed trends can be\nreproduced by models in which the stellar populations depend systematically\nonly on sigma, and are independent of stellar mass Mstel. For age, the observed\nluminosity correlation arises because young galaxies are brighter, at fixed\nMstel.

We employ this\ntechnique to measure an extremely anisotropic scattered image of the pulsar\nB0834+06 at 327 MHz. We find that the scattering occurs in a compact region\nabout 420 pc from the Earth. This image has two components, both essentially\nlinear and nearly parallel.

Abstract: The presence of convective motions in the atmospheres of metal-poor halo\nstars leads to systematic asymmetries of the emergent spectral line profiles.\nSince such line asymmetries are very small, they can be safely ignored for\nstandard spectroscopic abundance analysis. However, when it comes to the\ndetermination of the 6Li/7Li isotopic ratio, q(Li)=n(6Li)/n(7Li), the intrinsic\nasymmetry of the 7Li line must be taken into account, because its signature is\nessentially indistinguishable from the presence of a weak 6Li blend in the red\nwing of the 7Li line.

Using two samples of 24/25 Ly-alpha\nemitting galaxies at z = 0.3/2.3, we perform this test, including results at z\n= 3.1, and find that, whereas the ULIRG fraction at z = 3.1 is very small, it\nsystematically increases towards lower redshifts.

We interpret these variations in terms of relativistic precession\nof the pulsar spin axis about the total angular momentum vector of the system.\nOver the nine years, the pulse width at the 50% level has changed by more than\na factor of three. Large variations have also been observed in the 1400-MHz\nmean flux density. The pulse polarization has been monitored since 2004 April\nusing digital filterbank systems and also shows large and systematic variations\nin both linear and circular polarization. Position angle variations, both\nacross the pulse profile and over the data span, are complex, with major\ndifferences between the central and outer parts of the pulse profile. Modelling\nof the observed position angle variations by relativistic precession of the\npulsar spin axis shows that the spin-orbit misalignment angle is about 110 deg\nand that the precessional phase has passed through 180 deg during the course of\nour observations.

Combining the optical data with\nGalaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) UV photometry, we find that all blue-cored\ngalaxies show UV-optical colors that can only be explained by young stellar\npopulations. This implies that most of the residual star formation in\nearly-type galaxies is centrally concentrated. Blue-cored galaxies are\npredominantly low velocity dispersion systems. A simple model shows that the\nobserved positive color gradients (blue-cored) are visible only for a billion\nyears after a star formation episode for the typical strength of recent star\nformation.

Using a large ensemble (> 10^7) of mock\ngalaxies of unrestricted morphologies, we find that contaminations to the shear\nsignals from the noise of background photons can be removed in a well defined\nway because they are not correlated with the source shapes.

Furthermore, the stellar mass density obtained from the integral\nof the cosmic star formation history is higher than the measured one by a\nfactor of 2. In this paper, we study these issues using a semi-analytical model\nthat includes: 1) cold gas accretion in massive halos at high redshift; 2)\ntidal stripping of stellar mass from satellite galaxies; and 3) an evolving\nstellar initial mass function (bottom-light) with a higher gas recycle\nfraction. Our results show that the combined effects from 1) and 2) can predict\nsufficiently massive galaxies at high redshifts and reproduce their mild\nevolution at low redshift, While the combined effects of 1) and 3) can\nreproduce the correlation between star formation rate and stellar mass for\nstar-forming galaxies across wide range of redshifts. A bottom-light/top-heavy\nstellar IMF could partly resolve the conflict between the stellar mass density\nand cosmic star formation history. \n\n"}

As a consequence, most seemingly normal disk galaxies should be\nsurrounded by spatially extended stellar 'tidal features' of low surface\nbrightness. As part of a pilot survey for such interaction signatures, we have\ncarried out ultra deep, wide field imaging of 8 isolated spiral galaxies in the\nLocal Volume, with data taken at small (D=0.1-0.5m) robotic telescopes that\nprovide exquisite surface brightness sensitivity (mu_V)~28.5$ mag/arcsec^2).\nThis initial observational effort has led to the discovery of six previously\nundetected extensive (to ~30 kpc) stellar structures in the halos surrounding\nthese galaxies, likely debris from tidally disrupted satellites. In addition,\nwe confirm and clarify several enormous stellar over-densities previously\nreported in the literature, but never before interpreted as tidal streams. Even\nthis pilot sample of galaxies exhibits strikingly diverse morphological\ncharacteristics of these extended stellar features: great circle-like features\nthat resemble the Sagittarius stream surrounding the Milky Way, remote shells\nand giant clouds of presumed tidal debris far beyond the main stelar body, as\nwell as jet-like features emerging from galactic disks. A qualitative\ncomparison with available simulations set in a Lambda-Cold Dark Matter\ncosmology shows that the extraordinary variety of stellar morphologies detected\nin this pilot survey matches that seen in those simulations. The common\nexistence of these tidal features around 'normal' disk galaxies and the\nmorphological match to the simulations constitutes new evidence that these\ntheoretical models also apply to a large number of other Milky Way-mass disk\ngalaxies in the Local Volume. \n\n"}

The radiative transfer\nformulation took full account of emission, absorption, re-emission, Faraday\nrotation and Faraday conversion explicitly. High time-resolution intensity maps\nwere generated, frame-by-frame, to track the spatial hydrodynamical and\nradiative properties of the evolving jets. Intensity light curves were computed\nvia integrating spatially over the emission maps. We apply the models to jets\nin active galactic nuclei (AGN). From the jet simulations and the\ntime-dependent emission calculations we derived empirical relations for the\nemission intensity and size for jets at various evolutionary stages. The\ntemporal properties of jet emission are not solely consequences of intrinsic\nvariations in the hydrodynamics and thermal properties of the jet. They also\ndepend on the interaction between the jet and the ambient medium. The\ninterpretation of radio jet morphology therefore needs to take account of\nenvironmental factors. Our calculations have also shown that the environmental\ninteractions can affect specific emitting features, such as internal shocks and\nhotspots.

The first light, typically a UV or X-ray flash, is\nfollowed by a broken power-law decay of the luminosity generated by radiation\nthat leaks out of the expanding gas sphere. Motivated by recent detection of\nemission from very early stages of several SNe, we revisit the theory of shock\nbreakout and the following emission. We derive analytic light curves, paying\nspecial attention to the photon-gas coupling and deviations from thermal\nequilibrium. We then consider the breakout from several SNe progenitors. We\nfind that for more compact progenitors, white dwarfs, Wolf-Rayet stars (WRs)\nand possibly more energetic blue-supergiant explosions, the observed radiation\nis out of thermal equilibrium at the breakout, during the planar phase (i.e.,\nbefore the expanding gas doubles its radius), and during the early spherical\nphase. Therefore, during these phases we predict significantly higher\ntemperatures than previous analysis that assumed equilibrium. When thermal\nequilibrium prevails, we find the location of the thermalization depth and its\ntemporal evolution. Our results are useful for interpretation of early SN light\ncurves.

It has earlier been proposed that UHECRs could be\naccelerated in either the nucleus or the outer lobes of the nearby radio galaxy\nCen A. We show that UHECR production at a spatially intermediate location about\n15 kpc northeast from the nucleus, where the jet emerging from the nucleus is\nobserved to strike a large star-forming shell of gas, is a plausible\nalternative. A relativistic jet is capable of accelerating lower-energy heavy\nseed cosmic rays (CRs) to UHECRs on timescales comparable to the time it takes\nthe jet to pierce the large gaseous cloud.

The intrinsic colour scatter about the CMR is\nvery small (0.076) in rest-frame U-V. Only 7% of the galaxies are significantly\nbluer than the CMR. The scarcity of blue S0s indicates that, if they are the\ndescendants of spirals, these were already red when they became S0s. We observe\nno dependence of the CMR scatter with redshift or cluster velocity dispersion.\nThis implies that by the time cluster E/S0s achieve their morphology, the vast\nmajority have already joined the red sequence. We estimate the galaxy formation\nredshift z_F for each cluster and find that it does not depend on the cluster\nvelocity dispersion. However, z_F increases weakly with cluster redshift. This\ntrend becomes clearer when including higher-z clusters from the literature,\nsuggesting that, at any given z, in order to have a population of fully-formed\nE and S0s they needed to have formed most of their stars 2-4 Gyr prior to\nobservation.

The molecular composition of the\ntwo outflows presents systematic changes with velocity that we analyze by\ndividing the outflow in three chemical regimes, two of them associated with the\nwing component and the other the EHV gas. The analysis of the two wing regimes\nshows that species like H2CO and CH3OH favor the low-velocity gas, while SiO\nand HCN are more abundant in the fastest gas.

Its domain of applicability, that is baryonic densities ranging from about\n$\\rho>10^8$ g $\\cdot$ cm$^{-3}$ to normal nuclear density, temperatures between\n1 and 20 MeV and proton fractions between 0.5 and 0, make it suitable for the\ndescription of baryonic matter produced in supernovae explosions and\nproto-neutron stars. The first finding is that, contrary to the common belief,\nthe crust-core transition is not first order, and for all subsaturation\ndensities matter can be viewed as a continuous fluid mixture between free\nnucleons and massive nuclei. As a consequence, the equations of state and the\nassociated observables do not present any discontinuity over the whole\nthermodynamic range. We further investigate the nuclear matter composition over\na wide range of densities and temperatures. At high density and temperature our\nmodel accounts for a much larger mass fraction bound in medium nuclei with\nrespect to traditional approaches as Lattimer-Swesty, with sizeable\nconsequences on the thermodynamic quantities.

Given that the planet orbits a\nsolar-like star at a distance of on ly 4.5 R*, it is expected that material\nreleased from its surface may then form an exosphere.

Over a time span of between 0.6 to 5\nrest-frame years, the Mg II trough outflowing at 12,000 km/s decreased in\nequivalent width by a factor of two and the Fe II troughs at the same velocity\ndisappeared. The most likely explanation for the variability is that a\nstructure in the BAL outflow moved out of our line of sight to the ultraviolet\ncontinuum emitting region of the quasar's accretion disk. Given the size of\nthat region, this structure must have a transverse velocity of between 2600\nkm/s and 22,000 km/s. In the context of a simple outflow model, we show that\nthis BAL structure is located between approximately 5800 and 46,000\nSchwarzschild radii from the black hole. That distance corresponds to 1.7 to 14\npc, 11 to 88 times farther from the black hole than the H-beta broad-line\nregion.

HCO+ emission is a star\nformation indicator similar to HCN, tracing dense molecular hydrogen gas (n(H2)\n~= 10^5 cm^-3) within star-forming molecular clouds. We derive a\nlensing-corrected HCO+(J=4-3) line luminosity of L'(HCO+(4-3)) = (1.6+/-0.3) x\n10^9 (mu_L/11)^-1 K km/s pc^2, which corresponds to only 48% of the HCO+(J=1=0)\nluminosity, and <~4% of the CO(J=3-2) luminosity. The HCO+ excitation thus is\nclearly subthermal in the J=4-3 transition. Modeling of the HCO+ line radiative\ntransfer suggests that the HCO+ emission emerges from a region with physical\nproperties comparable to that exhibiting the CO line emission, but 2x higher\ngas density. This suggests that both HCO+ and CO lines trace the warm, dense\nmolecular gas where star formation actively takes place.

We\nfind large H3O+ abundances (N(H3O+)/N(H2)>10^{-8}) in all detected galaxies\napart from in IC342 where it is about one order of magnitude lower. We note,\nhowever, that uncertainties in N(H3O+) may be significant due to lack of\ndefinite information on source size and excitation. We furthermore compare the\nderived N(H3O+) with N(HCO+) and find that the H3O+ to HCO+ column density\nratio is large in NGC1068 (24), moderate in NGC4418 and NGC253 (4-5), slightly\nless than unity in NGC6240 (0.7) and lowest in IC342 (0.2-0.6). We compare our\nresults with models of X-ray and photon dominated regions (XDRs and PDRs). For\nIC342 we find that a starburst PDR chemistry can explain the observed H3O+\nabundance. For the other galaxies, the large H3O+ columns are generally\nconsistent with XDR models. In particular for NGC1068 the elevated\nN(H3O+)/N(HCO+) ratio suggests a low column density XDR. For NGC4418 however,\nlarge HC3N abundances are inconsistent with the XDR interpretation.

The shallow gravitational potential of the dark matter\nsubhaloes (compared to the primary halo) allows us to use the epicyclic\napproximation, the equations of which we solve by modal analysis, i.e.,\nassuming a disc is composed of N radial rings with M modes. We show that\nproperties of dark matter subhaloes can be inferred from the profile and\namplitude of the modal energy of the disc.

Finally, we show that our results agree with those from full\nhydrodynamic simulation.

Fast rotators are often barred and span the same full range of\nbulge fractions as spiral galaxies. The slow rotators are rounder and are\ngenerally consistent with being genuine, namely spheroidal-like, elliptical\ngalaxies.

We study for the first time the\nkinematic morphology-density T-Sigma relation using fast and slow rotators to\nreplace lenticulars and ellipticals. We find that our relation is cleaner than\nusing classic morphology. Slow rotators are nearly absent at the lowest density\nenvironments [f(SR)<2%] and generally constitute a small fraction [f(SR)~4%] of\nthe total galaxy population in the environments explored by our survey, with\nthe exception of the densest core of the Virgo cluster [f(SR)~20%].

This is a mass distribution with more abrupt\ngravitational forces. We perform test particle simulations after tuning the two\nmodels to the observational range for the MW spiral arm properties. We explore\nthe effects of the arm properties and find that a significant region of the\nallowed parameter space favours the appearance of kinematic groups. The\nvelocity distribution is mostly sensitive to the relative spiral arm phase and\npattern speed. In all cases the arms induce strong kinematic imprints for\npattern speeds around 17 km/s/kpc (close to the 4:1 inner resonance) but no\nsubstructure is induced close to corotation.

In order to do so we improve an analytic description of relativistic\nradiation mediated shocks and follow the system from the breakout itself,\nthrough the planar phase and into the spherical phase. We limit our calculation\nto cases where the post breakout acceleration of the gas ends during the planar\nphase. (i.e., the final gas Lorentz factor <~30). We find that spherical\nrelativistic breakouts produce a flash of gamma-rays with energy, temperature,\nand duration that always satisfy a specific relation between them as well as\nproviding the breakout radius and Lorentz factor. The breakout flare is\ntypically followed, on longer time scales, by X-rays that carry a comparable\nenergy. We apply our model to a variety of explosions, including Ia and .Ia\nsupernovae (SNe), AIC, energetic SNe and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We find that\nall these events produce detectable gamma-ray signals, some of which may have\nalready been seen. Some particular examples are: (i) Relativistic shock\nbreakouts provide a natural explanation to the energy, temperature and time\nscales, as well as many other observed features, of all low luminosity GRBs.\n(ii) Nearby broad-line Ib/c (like SN 2002ap) may produce a detectable gamma-ray\nsignal.

In particular, the\nnuclear star-formation rate (SFR) traced by the 11.3 micron aromatic feature\nfollows a relationship with the black hole accretion rate (BHAR) of the form\nSFR\\proptoBHAR^0.8, with an observed scatter of 0.5 dex.

Over this redshift range the mean pair fraction is\nessentially constant (evolving as f_pair (1+z)^{-0.4 +/- 0.6}) with about\n6+/-1% of massive galaxies having a 1:4 or greater companion within 30h^-1 kpc.\nAssuming the timescale over which pairs merge is not a strong function of\nredshift, this implies a similarly constant merger rate (per unit time) out to\nz=2.

The dense\ncores are identified in the simulated density data cube through a clumpfind\nalgorithm.

In the absence of a magnetic field,\nthe majority of the cores have supersonic velocity dispersions. A\nmoderately-strong magnetic field reduces the dispersion to a subsonic or at\nmost transonic value typically. Most of the cores are out of virial\nequilibrium, with the external pressure dominating the self-gravity. The\nimplication is that the core evolution is largely controlled by the\noutflow-driven turbulence.

The\nsize growth appears to be independent of stellar mass, with the mass-normalized\nhalf-light radius scaling with redshift as R_e (1+z)^(-1.62 +/- 0.34).\nSurprisingly, this power law seems to be in good agreement with the recently\nreported continuous size evolution of UV-bright galaxies in the redshift range\nz~0.5-3.5.

We use numerical simulations of merging\ndisc galaxies to investigate which mechanism dominates. The simulations include\na model for the formation and dynamical disruption of the entire star cluster\npopulation. We find that the dynamical heating of clusters by tidal shocks is\nabout an order of magnitude higher in interacting galaxies than in isolated\ngalaxies. This is driven by the increased gas density, and is sufficient to\ndestroy star clusters at a higher rate than new clusters are formed: the total\nnumber of clusters in the merger remnant is 2-50% of the amount in the\nprogenitor discs, with low-mass clusters being disrupted preferentially. By\nadopting observationally motivated selection criteria, we find that the\nobserved surplus of star clusters in nearby merging galaxies is caused by the\nbias to detect young, massive clusters. We provide a general expression for the\nsurvival fraction of clusters, which increases with the gas depletion\ntime-scale.

Our aim is to determine precisely the abundance distribution of HDO\ntowards the low-mass protostar IRAS16293-2422 and learn more about the water\nformation mechanisms by determining the HDO/H2O abundance ratio. A spectral\nsurvey of the source IRAS16293-2422 was carried out in the framework of the\nCHESS Herschel Key program with the HIFI instrument, allowing the detection of\nnumerous HDO lines. Other transitions have been observed previously with\nground-based telescopes. The spherical Monte Carlo radiative transfer code\nRATRAN was used to reproduce the observed line profiles of HDO by assuming an\nabundance jump. To determine the H2O abundance throughout the envelope, a\nsimilar study was made of the H2-18O observed lines, as the H2O main isotope\nlines are contaminated by the outflows. We derive an inner HDO abundance of\n1.7e-7 and an outer HDO abundance of 8e-11. To reproduce the HDO absorption\nlines, it is necessary to add an absorbing layer in front of the envelope. It\nmay correspond to a water-rich layer created by the photodesorption of the ices\nat the edges of the molecular cloud. The HDO/H2O ratio is ~1.4-5.8% in the hot\ncorino whereas it is ~0.2-2.2% in the outer envelope. It is estimated at ~4.8%\nin the added absorbing layer. Although it is clearly higher than the cosmic D/H\nabundance, the HDO/H2O ratio remains lower than the D/H ratio derived for other\ndeuterated molecules observed in the same source. The similarity of the ratios\nderived in the hot corino and in the added absorbing layer suggests that water\nformed before the gravitational collapse of the protostar, contrary to\nformaldehyde and methanol, which formed later once the CO molecules had\ndepleted on the grains. \n\n"}

Our fiducial model, which includes\nradiative cooling by heavy elements and feedback by supernovae and active\ngalactic nuclei, predicts that by z = 0.25 nearly 60 per cent of the gas mass\nends up at densities and temperatures characteristic of the WHIM and we find\nthat half of this fraction is due to outflows. The standard HI observables\n(distribution of HI column densities N_HI, distribution of Doppler parameters\nb_HI, b_HI - N_HI correlation) and the BLA line number density predicted by our\nsimulations are in remarkably good agreement with observations.\n  BLAs arise in gas that is hotter, more highly ionised and more enriched than\nthe gas giving rise to typical Lyman-Alpha forest absorbers. The majority of\nthe BLAs arise in warm-hot (log (T/K) ~ 5) gas at low (log Delta < 1.5)\noverdensities. On average, thermal broadening accounts for at least 60 per cent\nof the BLA line width, which in turn can be used as a rough indicator of the\nthermal state of the gas.

We construct phenomenological models of\nlarge-scale outflows which consist of cold clumps that are in pressure\nequilibrium with a constant-velocity hot wind. First we consider models in\nwhich the cold clumps are distributed symmetrically around the galaxy, and in\nwhich the clumps undergo a continuous acceleration in its 'circumgalactic'\nmedium (CGM). We constrain the properties of the cold clumps (radius, velocity,\nHI column density, & number density) by matching the observed Lya absorption\nstrength of the CGM in the spectra of background galaxies. We then insert a Lya\nsource in the center of this clumpy outflow, which consists of 1e5-1e6 clumps,\nand compute observable properties of the scattered Lya photons. In these\nmodels, the scattered radiation forms halos that are significantly more\nconcentrated than is observed. In order to simultaneously reproduce the\nobserved Lya absorption line strengths and the Lya halos, we require -\npreferably bipolar - outflows in which the clumps decelerate after their\ninitial acceleration.

The study of LBGs may help define the\nfeed-back relationship between black holes (BHs) and their host galaxies.\nPrevious VLA observations have shown that the kpc-scale radio emission from\nLBAs is dominated by starbursts. The main targets of this VLBI experiment were\nselected because they possessed emission-line properties between starbursts and\nType 2 (obscured) AGN. Eight targets (three star-forming LBAs, four composite\nLBAs, and one Type 1 AGN) were observed at 5 GHz, four of which were also\nobserved at 1.7 GHz. One star-forming LBA and one composite LBA were detected\nabove 5 \\sigma at 1.7 GHz (only), while the AGN was detected at 5 GHz.

Some argue that it is a bimodal distribution, implying that there\nare two separate QSO populations (normally referred to as 'radio-loud' and\n'radio-quiet'), while others claim it forms a more continuous distribution\ncharacteristic of a single population. We use deep observations at 20 GHz to\ninvestigate whether the distribution is bimodal at high radio frequencies.\nCarrying out this study at high radio frequencies has an advantage over\nprevious studies as the radio emission comes predominantly from the core of the\nAGN, hence probes the most recent activity. Studies carried out at lower\nfrequencies are dominated by the large scale lobes where the emission is built\nup over longer timescales (10^7-10^8 yrs), thereby confusing the sample. Our\nsample comprises 874 X-ray selected QSOs that were observed as part of the 6dF\nGalaxy Survey. Of these, 40% were detected down to a 3 sigma detection limit of\n0.2-0.5 mJy.\n  No evidence of bimodality is seen in either the 20 GHz luminosity\ndistribution or in the distribution of the R_20 parameter: the ratio of the\nradio to optical luminosities traditionally used to classify objects as being\neither radio-loud or radio-quiet. Previous results have claimed that at low\nradio luminosities, star formation processes can dominate the radio emission\nobserved in QSOs. We attempt to investigate these claims by stacking the\nundetected sources at 20 GHz and discuss the limitations in carrying out this\nanalysis. However, if the radio emission was solely due to star formation\nprocesses, we calculate that this corresponds to star formation rates ranging\nfrom ~10 solar masses/yr to ~2300 solar masses/yr. \n\n"}

We\nfind that the Arnaud et al. universal pressure profile does not fit Coma, and\nthat their pressure profile for merging systems provides a good fit of the data\nonly at r<R_500: by r=2XR_500 it underestimates the observed y profile by a\nfactor of ~2. This may indicate that at these larger radii either i) the\ncluster SZ emission is contaminated by unresolved SZ sources along the line of\nsight or ii) the pressure profile of Coma is higher at r>R_500 than the mean\npressure profile predicted by the simulations. The Planck image shows\nsignificant local steepening of the y profile in two regions about half a\ndegree to the west and to the south-east of the cluster centre. These features\nare consistent with the presence of shock fronts at these radii, and indeed the\nwestern feature was previously noticed in the ROSAT PSPC mosaic as well as in\nthe radio. Using Planck y profiles extracted from corresponding sectors we find\npressure jumps of 4.5+0.4-0.2 and 5.0+1.3-0.1 in the west and southeast,\nrespectively.

We analyze the rest-frame U-B color\ncorrelations versus these structural parameters using a sample of galaxies in\nthe redshift range 0.5< z<0.8 from the DEEP2/AEGIS survey.

There exists,\nhowever, a significant population of outliers with blue colors yet high n\nvalues that seem to contradict this behavior. We hypothesize that their Sersic\nvalues may be distorted by bursts of star formation, AGNs, and/or poor fits,\nleading us to consider central surface stellar mass density as an alternative\nto Sersic index.

This way, we can calculate the growth rate of the small-scale\ndynamo quantitatively and predict the evolution of the small-scale magnetic\nfield. As the magnetic energy is transported to larger scales on the local\neddy-timescale, we obtain an estimate for the magnetic field on the Jeans\nscale. Even there, we find that equipartition with the kinetic energy is\nreached on small timescales. Dynamically relevant field structures can thus be\nexpected already during the formation of the first objects in the Universe. \n\n"}

While both direct detections and stacking suggest that the AGN\nfraction in sBzK galaxies is high, there is no clear evidence for widespread\nCompton thick activity in either the sBzK population generally, or the IR\nExcess sBzK subsample.

Spheroids delay and slow down the\ninitial growth of the bar they host, but, at the later stages of the evolution,\nthey strengthen the bar by absorbing angular momentum. Increased velocity\ndispersion in the (near-)resonant regions delays bar formation and leads to\nless strong bars. When bars form they are vertically thin, but soon their inner\nparts puff up and form what is commonly known as the boxy/peanut bulge. This\ngives a complex and interesting shape to the bar which explains a number of\nobservations and also argues that the COBE/DIRBE bar and the Long bar in our\nGalaxy are, respectively, the thin and the thick part of a single bar. The\nvalue of the bar pattern speed may be set by optimising the balance between\nemitters and absorbers, so that a maximum amount of angular momentum is\nredistributed.

Combining deep 2-4 Ms\nChandra data with Spitzer IRAC/MIPS and VLA data within the GOODS-N/S and\nCOSMOS fields, we find evidence for AGN activity in ~14 percent of 271 AzTEC\nSMGs, ~28 percent considering only the two GOODS fields. Through X-ray spectral\nmodeling and SED fitting using Monte Carlo Markov Chain techniques to\nSiebenmorgen et al. (2004) (AGN) and Efstathiou et al.

Inclusion of the X-ray luminosities as a\nprior to the NIR-to-radio SED effectively sets the AGN luminosity and SFR,\npreventing significant contribution from the AGN template.

At 10^10.5<Mgalaxy<10^11 Msun, we see no change in the number density\nof compact Q-ETGs, while at >10^11 Msun we find a decrease by 30%. In both mass\nbins, the increase of the median sizes of Q-ETGs with time is primarily caused\nby the addition to the size function of larger and more diffuse Q-ETGs. At all\nmasses, compact Q-ETGs become systematically redder towards later epochs, with\na (U-V) difference consistent with passive evolution of their stellar\npopulations, indicating that they are a population that does not appreciably\nevolve in size. At all epochs, the larger Q-ETGs (at least in the lower mass\nbin) have average rest-frame colors systematically bluer than those of the more\ncompact Q-ETGs, suggesting that the former are younger than the latter. The\nidea that new, large, Q-ETGs are responsible for the observed growth in the\nmedian size of the population at a given mass is supported by the sizes and\nnumber of the star-forming galaxies that are expected to be progenitors of the\nnew Q-ETGs over the same period. In the low mass bin, the new Q-ETG have 30%\nsmaller sizes than their star-forming progenitors. This is likely due to the\nfading of their disks after they cease star-formation. Comparison with higher z\nshows that the median size of newly-quenched galaxies roughly scales, at\nconstant mass, as (1+z)^-1.

On the other hand, given the large number of particles and\nforces in the visible world, a more complex dark sector could be a reasonable\nor even likely possibility. This hypothesis leads to testable consequences,\nperhaps portending the discovery of a rich hidden world neighboring our own. We\nconsider a scenario that readily satisfies current bounds that we call\nPartially Interacting Dark Matter (PIDM). This scenario contains\nself-interacting dark matter, but it is not the dominant component. Even if\nPIDM contains only a fraction of the net dark matter density, comparable to the\nbaryonic fraction, the subdominant component's interactions can lead to\ninteresting and potentially observable consequences. Our primary focus will be\nthe special case of Double-Disk Dark Matter (DDDM), in which self-interactions\nallow the dark matter to lose enough energy to lead to dynamics similar to\nthose in the baryonic sector. We explore a simple model in which DDDM can cool\nefficiently and form a disk within galaxies, and we evaluate some of the\npossible observational signatures.

Z_c is much smaller than the typical average metallicity, <Z>, and\nthus the mixing efficiency of the pristine gas in the interstellar medium plays\na crucial role in the transition from Pop III to normal star formation. The\nsmall critical value, Z_c, corresponds to the far left tail of the probability\ndistribution function (PDF) of the metallicity. Based on closure models for the\nPDF formulation of turbulent mixing, we derive equations for the fraction of\ngas, P, lying below Z_c, in compressible turbulence. Our simulation data shows\nthat the evolution of the fraction P can be well approximated by a generalized\nself-convolution model, which predicts dP/dt = -n/tau_con P (1-P^(1/n)), where\nn is a measure of the locality of the PDF convolution and the timescale tau_con\nis determined by the rate at which turbulence stretches the pollutants.

Such a scenario has been\ndiscussed as a viable model for light (~ 10 GeV) neutralino dark matter as\nexplanation of possible DAMA and CoGeNT direct detection signals. Here we give\nphysical and analytical arguments showing that the sbottom resonance may\nactually not be there.

In the limit of vanishing gluon momenta, this pole\ncorresponds to the only cut of the neutralino self-energy diagram with a quark\nand a squark running in the loop, when the decay process chi->squark+quark\nbecomes kinematically allowed. The pole can be interpreted as the formation of\na sbottom-antibottom-qqq or antisbottom-bottom qqq resonant state (where qqq\nare the nucleon valence quarks), which is kinematically not accessible if the\nneutralino is the LSP. Our analysis shows that the common practice of\nestimating the neutralino-nucleon cross section by introducing an ad-hoc pole\nat m_sbottom=m_chi+m_b into the effective four-fermion interaction (including\nhigher-twist effects) should be discouraged, since it corresponds to adding a\nspurious pole to the scattering process at the center-of-mass energy sqrt(s)\nm_chi m_sbottom-m_b. Our considerations can be extended from the specific case\nof supersymmetry to other cases in which the dark matter particle scatters off\nnucleons through the exchange of a b-flavored state almost degenerate to its\nmass, such as in theories with extra dimensions and in other mass-degenerate\ndark matter scenarios recently discussed in the literature. \n\n"}

Abstract: Recent observations have indicated that a large fraction of the low to\nintermediate luminosity AGN population lives in disk-dominated hosts, while the\nmore luminous quasars live in bulge-dominated hosts, in conflict with some\nprevious model predictions. We therefore build and compare a semi-empirical\nmodel for AGN fueling which accounts for both merger and non-merger\n'triggering.' In particular, we show that the 'stochastic accretion' model - in\nwhich fueling in disk galaxies is essentially a random process arising whenever\ndense gas clouds reach the nucleus - provides a good match to the present\nobservations at low/intermediate luminosities. However it falls short of the\nhigh-luminosity population. We combine this with models for major\nmerger-induced AGN fueling, which lead to rarer but more luminous events, and\npredict the resulting abundance of disk-dominated and bulge-dominated AGN host\ngalaxies as a function of luminosity and redshift. We compile and compare\nobservational constraints from z~0-2.

The trend between G/D and metallicity is\nempirically modelled using power-laws (slope of -1 and free) and a broken\npower-law.

In the case of Standard Cosmological Model one of the most\npromising directions of generalization is replacement of the cosmological\nconstant with a more complicated, dynamic, form of dark energy and\nincorporation of interaction between the dark components---dark energy (DE) and\ndark matter (DM). Typically, DE models are based on scalar fields minimally\ncoupled to gravity, and do not implement explicit coupling of the field to the\nbackground DM. However, there is no fundamental reason for this assumption in\nthe absence of an underlying symmetry which would suppress the coupling. Given\nthat we do not know the true nature of either DE or DM, we cannot exclude the\npossibility that there is some kind of coupling between them.

I\nillustrate how to calculate the stream's average location (its \"track\"') in\ndifferent coordinate systems, how to quickly estimate the dispersion around its\ntrack, and how to draw mock stream data. As a generative model, this framework\nallows one to compute the full probability distribution function and\nmarginalize over or condition it on certain phase-space dimensions as well as\nconvolve it with observational uncertainties.

Using the\nmass-accretion rates evaluated from the thermal evolution in the preceding\ncollapse phase of the pre-stellar cores, we calculate disk structures and their\nevolution in the framework of the standard steady disks. Overall, with higher\nmetallicity, more efficient cooling results in the lower accretion rate and\nlower temperature inside the disk: at zero metallicity, the accretion rate is ~\n1e-3Msun/yr and the disk temperature is ~ 1000 K, while at solar metallicity, ~\n1e-6Msun/yr and 10 K. Despite the large difference in these values, the zero-\nand solar-metallicity disks have similar stability properties: the Toomre\nparameter for the gravitational stability, which can be written using the ratio\nof temperatures in the disk and in the envelope as Q ~ (T_disk/T_env)^3/2, is >\n1, i.e., marginally stable.

Young massive cluster (YMC) progenitor\nclouds in the Galactic Center can accumulate to a high enough density without\nforming stars that the initial protostellar densities are close to the final\nstellar density. For this to hold in the disk, the time scale to accumulate the\ngas to such high densities must be much shorter than the star formation\ntimescale. Otherwise the gas begins forming stars while it is being accumulated\nto high density. The distinction between the formation regimes in the two\nenvironments is consistent with the predictions of environmentally-dependent\ndensity thresholds for star formation. This implies that stars in YMCs of\nsimilar total mass and radius can have formed at widely different initial\nprotostellar densities. The fact that no systematic variations in fundamental\nproperties are observed between YMCs in the disk and Galactic Center suggests\nstellar mass assembly is not strongly affected by the initial protostellar\ndensity. We review recent theoretical advances and summarize the debate on\nthree key open questions: the initial (proto)stellar distribution, infant\n(im)mortality and age spreads within YMCs. We conclude: the initial\nprotostellar distribution is likely hierarchical; YMCs likely experienced a\nformation history that was dominated by gas exhaustion rather than gas\nexpulsion; YMCs are dynamically stable from a young age; and YMCs have age\nspreads much smaller than their mean age.

Other physical estimates of the extent of gravitational\ninfluence include the gravitational radius, gas accretion radius, and\n\"galactopause\" arising from outflows that stall at 100-200 kpc over a range of\noutflow parameters and confining gas pressures. Physical criteria are proposed\nto define bound structures, including a more realistic definition of R_vir (M*,\nM_h, z_a) for stellar mass M* and halo mass M_h, half of which formed at\n\"assembly redshifts\" z_a = 0.7-1.3. We estimate the extent of bound gas and\ndark matter around L* galaxies to be ~200 kpc. The new virial radii, with mean\nR_vir ~ 200 kpc, are 40-50% smaller than values estimated in recent HST/COS\ndetections of H I and O VI absorbers around galaxies. In the new formalism, the\nMilky Way stellar mass, log M* = 10.7 +/- 0.1, would correspond to R_vir = 153\n(+25,-16) kpc for half-mass halo assembly at z_a = 1.06 +/- 0.03. The frequency\nper unit redshift of low-redshift O VI absorption lines in QSO spectra suggests\nabsorber sizes ~150 kpc when related to intervening 0.1L* galaxies. This\nformalism is intended to clarify semantic differences arising from observations\nof extended gas in galactic halos, circumgalactic medium (CGM), and filaments\nof the intergalactic medium (IGM). Astronomers should refer to bound gas in the\ngalactic halo or CGM, and unbound gas at the CGM-IGM interface, on its way into\nthe IGM. \n\n"}

For the\nfirst time, we fit 2-dimensional models comprising a single Sersic fit and\ntwo-component (i.e., bulge + disk) decompositions not only to the H-band light\ndistributions, but also to the stellar mass maps reconstructed from resolved\nstellar population modeling. We confirm that the increased bulge prominence\namong quiescent galaxies, as reported previously based on rest-optical\nobservations, remains in place when considering the distributions of stellar\nmass. Moreover, we observe an increase of the typical Sersic index and\nbulge-to-total ratio (with median B/T reaching 40-50%) among star-forming\ngalaxies above 10^11 Msun. Given that quenching for these most massive systems\nis likely to be imminent, our findings suggest that significant bulge growth\nprecedes a departure from the star-forming main sequence. We demonstrate that\nthe bulge mass (and ideally knowledge of the bulge and total mass) is a more\nreliable predictor of the star-forming versus quiescent state of a galaxy than\nthe total stellar mass. The same trends are predicted by the state-of-the-art\nsemi-analytic model by Somerville et al. In the latter, bulges and black holes\ngrow hand in hand through merging and/or disk instabilities, and AGN-feedback\nshuts off star formation.

The source and sink\nterms of the continuity equations for gas and stars are expressed in simple\nterms from first principles. The assumed dependence of star-formation rate\n(SFR) on gas mass self-regulates the system into a unique asymptotic behavior,\nwhich is approximated by an analytic quasi-steady-state solution (QSS). We\naddress the validity of the QSS at different epochs independent of earlier\nconditions. At high z, where the accretion is assumed to consist of gas only,\nthe specific SFR is robustly predicted to be sSFR = [(1+z)/3]^{5/2} Gyr^{-1},\nslightly higher than the cosmological specific accretion rate, in agreement\nwith observations at z=3-8. The gas fraction is expected to decline slowly, and\nthe observations constrain the SFR efficiency per dynamical time to\nepsilon=0.02. The stellar-to-virial mass ratio f_sv is predicted to be constant\nin time, and the observed value requires an outflow mass-lading factor of\neta=1-3, depending on the penetration efficiency of gas into the galaxy.\nHowever, at z=2, where stars are also accreted through mergers, the simplest\nmodel has an apparent difficulty in matching observations. The model that\nmaximizes the sSFR, with the outflows fully recycled, falls short by a factor 3\nin sSFR, and overestimates f_sv. With strong outflows, the model can reproduce\nthe observed f_sv but at the expense of underestimating the sSFR by an order of\nmagnitude.

We show that the green valley between the\nblue cloud of star-forming galaxies and the red sequence of quiescent galaxies\nin the colour-mass diagram is not a single transitional state through which\nmost blue galaxies evolve into red galaxies. Rather, an analysis that takes\nmorphology into account makes clear that only a small population of blue\nearly-type galaxies move rapidly across the green valley after the morphologies\nare transformed from disk to spheroid and star formation is quenched rapidly.\nIn contrast, the majority of blue star-forming galaxies have significant disks,\nand they retain their late-type morphologies as their star formation rates\ndecline very slowly. We summarize a range of observations that lead to these\nconclusions, including UV-optical colours and halo masses, which both show a\nstriking dependence on morphological type. We interpret these results in terms\nof the evolution of cosmic gas supply and gas reservoirs. We conclude that\nlate-type galaxies are consistent with a scenario where the cosmic supply of\ngas is shut off, perhaps at a critical halo mass, followed by a slow exhaustion\nof the remaining gas over several Gyr, driven by secular and/or environmental\nprocesses.

It is hoped that streams or shells of stars produced by\ntidal disruption of stellar systems will provide precise measures of the\ngravitational potential to test these predictions. We develop a method for\ninferring the Galactic potential with tidal streams based on the idea that the\nstream stars were once close in phase space. Our method can flexibly adapt to\nany form for the Galactic potential: it works in phase-space rather than\naction-space and hence relies neither on our ability to derive actions nor on\nthe integrability of the potential. Our model is probabilistic, with a\nlikelihood function and priors on the parameters. The method can properly\naccount for finite observational uncertainties and missing data dimensions. We\ntest our method on synthetic datasets generated from N-body simulations of\nsatellite disruption in a static, multi-component Milky Way including a\ntriaxial dark matter halo with observational uncertainties chosen to mimic\ncurrent and near-future surveys of various stars.

The\nassociations of pre- and proto- stellar cores with the filaments suggest a\ndirect link with the process of star formation.

{"id": "1406.5191", "contents": "Title: Decoding the Star-Forming Main Sequence or: How I Learned to Stop\n  Worrying and Love the Central Limit Theorem Abstract: Star-formation rates (SFR) of disk galaxies strongly correlate with stellar\nmass, with a small dispersion in SSFR at fixed mass, sigma~0.3 dex. With such\nsmall scatter this star-formation main sequence (SFMS) has been interpreted as\ndeterministic and fundamental. Here we demonstrate that it is a simple\nconsequence of the central limit theorem. Our derivation begins by\napproximating in situ stellar mass growth as a stochastic process, much like a\nrandom walk (where the expectation of SFR at any time is equal to the SFR at\nthe previous time). We then derive expectation values for median SSFR of\nstar-forming disks and their scatter over time. We generalize the results for\nstochastic changes in SFR that are not independent of each other but are\ncorrelated over time. For unbiased samples of (disk) galaxies, we derive an\nexpectation that <SSFR> should be independent of mass, decline as 1/T, and have\na relative scatter that is independent of mass and time. The derived SFMS and\nits evolution matches published data to z=10 with sufficient accuracy to\nconstrain cosmological parameters. The framework reproduces several important\nobservables, including: the scatter in SSFR at fixed mass; the SFHs of nearby\ndwarf galaxies and the Milky Way; and the scatter in the Tully-Fisher relation.\nThe evolution of the mass function is less well reproduced and we discuss ways\nto generalize the framework to include other sources of stellar mass such as\nmergers. The predicted dispersion in SSFR has consequences for the\nclassification of quiescent galaxies, as such galaxies have heterogeneous\nformation histories, and many may only be temporarily diminished in their\nstar-formation activity. The implied dispersion in SFHs, and the SFMS's\ninsensitivity to timescales of stochasticity, thus substantially limits the\nability to connect massive galaxies to their progenitors over long cosmic\nbaselines.

In actively star-forming\ngalaxies, the progression of the star formation rate is shallower than a\n$t^{-1}$ SN Ia DTD, so mean SN Ia ages peak at the DTD peak in all star-forming\ngalaxies at all epochs of cosmic history.

Our model naturally predicts that low-mass galaxies tend to\nbe actively star-forming while massive galaxies are generally passive,\nconsistent with observations of galaxy \"downsizing\". Consequently, the mean\nages of SNe Ia undergo a sharp transition from young ages at low host mass to\nold ages at high host mass, qualitatively similar to the transition of mean SN\nIa Hubble residuals with host mass.

We\ndescribe here a new method using time-delay lensed quasars where one or several\nimages are affected by microlensing due to stars in the lensing galaxy. Because\nmicrolensing decreases (or increases) the flux of the continuum compared to the\nbroad line region, it changes the contrast between these two emission\ncomponents.

Using 3D hydrodynamic simulations, we show that such\ndeficit arises from the tight self-regulation between thermal instability\ncondensation and AGN outflow injection: condensing clouds boost the AGN\noutflows, which quench cooling as they thermalize through the core. The\nresultant average distribution slope is $\\alpha \\simeq 2$, oscillating within\nthe observed $1<\\alpha<3$. In the absence of thermal instability, the X-ray\nspectrum remains isothermal ($\\alpha > 8$), while unopposed cooling drives a\ntoo shallow slope, $\\alpha<1$. AGN outflows deposit their energy inside-out,\nreleasing more heat in the inner cooler phase; radially distributed heating\nalone induces a declining spectrum, $1<\\alpha<2$. Turbulence further steepens\nthe spectrum and increases the scatter: the turbulent Mach number in the hot\nphase is subsonic, while it becomes transonic in the cooler phase, making\nperturbations to depart from the isobaric mode. Such increase in $d\\ln P/d\\ln\nT$ leads to $\\alpha\\approx3$. Self-regulated AGN outflow feedback can address\nthe soft X-ray problem through the interplay of heating and turbulence. \n\n"}

The RAVE\nCollaboration has just released a new estimate of $v_{\\rm esc}$ (Piffl {\\em et\nal.}, 2014 --- P14) that supersedes the previous one (Smith {\\em et al.},\n2007), which is of interest in the perspective of reducing the astrophysical\nuncertainties in DD. Nevertheless, these new estimates cannot be used blindly\nas they rely on assumptions in the dark halo modeling which induce tight\ncorrelations between the escape speed and other local astrophysical parameters.\nWe make a self-consistent study of the implications of the RAVE results on DD\nassuming isotropic DM velocity distributions, both Maxwellian and ergodic.\nTaking as references the experimental sensitivities currently achieved by LUX,\nCRESST-II, and SuperCDMS, we show that: (i) the exclusion curves associated\nwith the best-fit points of P14 may be more constraining by up to $\\sim 40$%\nwith respect to standard limits, because the underlying astrophysical\ncorrelations induce a larger local DM density; (ii) the corresponding relative\nuncertainties inferred in the low WIMP mass region may be moderate, down to\n10-15% below 10 GeV.

This value was debated because if true, it would imply either that the\nrelevant absorption processes of gamma-rays are not well understood or that the\nEBL is dramatically different from what is believed today.

We use HST\ngrism redshifts and extensive photometry in all five 3D-HST/CANDELS fields,\nmore than doubling the area used previously for such studies, and combine these\ndata with Keck MOSFIRE and NIRSPEC spectroscopy. We first confirm that a\npopulation of massive, compact, star forming galaxies exists at z~2, using\nK-band spectroscopy of 25 of these objects at 2.0<z<2.5.

We infer from the kinematics and\nspatial distribution of Halpha that the galaxies have rotating disks of ionized\ngas that are a factor of ~2 more extended than the stellar distribution. By\ncombining measurements of individual galaxies, we find that the kinematics are\nconsistent with a nearly Keplerian fall-off from V_rot~500 km/s at 1 kpc to\nV_rot~250 km/s at 7 kpc, and that the total mass out to this radius is\ndominated by the dense stellar component.

The task is complicated by the nonlinear biasing and redshift space\ndistortion effects, which change with halo mass, and by the wide distribution\nof halo masses and their occupations by galaxies. One of the main modeling\nchallenges is the existence of satellite galaxies that have both radial\ndistribution and large virial velocities inside halos, a phenomenon known as\nthe Finger-of-God effect. We present a model for the galaxy power spectrum of\nin which we decompose a given galaxy sample into central and satellite galaxies\nand relate different contributions to 1- and 2-halo terms in a halo model. Our\nprimary goal is to ensure that any parameters that we introduce have physically\nmeaningful values, and are not just fitting parameters. For the 2-halo terms we\nuse the previously developed RSD modeling of halos in the context of\ndistribution function and perturbation theory approach. This term needs to be\nmultiplied by the effect of radial distances and velocities of satellites\ninside the halo. To this one needs to add the 1-halo terms, which are\nnon-perturbative. We show that the real space 1-halo terms can be modeled as\nalmost constant, with the finite extent of the satellites inside the halo\ninducing a small k^2R^2 term, where R is related to the size of the halo. We\nadopt a similar model for FoG in redshift space, ensuring that FoG velocity\ndispersion is related to the halo mass. For FoG k^2 type expansions do not work\nand FoG resummation must be used instead. We test several damping functions to\nmodel the velocity dispersion FoG effect.

The mass of disc gas, M$_{\\rm gas}$, depends upon a galaxy halo's\nspin and virial mass, but not upon stellar feedback. Halos with low spin have\nhigh star formation efficiency and lower disc gas mass. Similarly, lower\nstellar feedback leads to more star formation so the gas mass ends up nearly\nthe same irregardless of stellar feedback strength. Even considering spin, the\nM$_{\\rm gas}$ relation with halo mass, M$_{200}$ only shows a factor of 3\nscatter. The M$_{\\rm gas}$--M$_{200}$ relation show a break at\nM$_{200}$=$2\\times10^{11}$ M$_\\odot$ that corresponds to an observed break in\nthe M$_{\\rm gas}$--M$_\\star$ relation.

The origin of these tidal features is discussed,\neither coming from a satellite infall or caused by residuals of an ancient,\ngas-rich major merger. By modelling the formation of the peculiar features\nobserved in the NGC 4013 halo, we investigate their origin. By using GADGET -2\nwith implemented gas cooling, star formation, and feedback, we have modelled\nthe overall NGC 4013 galaxy and its associated halo features. A gas-rich major\nmerger occurring 2.7-4.6 Gyr ago succeeds in reproducing the NGC 4013 galaxy\nproperties, including all the faint stellar features, strong gas warp,\nboxy-shaped halo and vertical 3.6 mum luminosity distribution. High gas\nfractions in the progenitors are sufficient to reproduce the observed thin and\nthick discs, with a small bulge fraction, as observed. A major merger is able\nto reproduce the overall NGC 4013 system, including the warp strength, the red\ncolour and the high stellar mass density of the loop, while a minor merger\nmodel cannot. Because the gas-rich model suffices to create a pseudo-bulge with\na small fraction of the light, NGC 4013 is perhaps the archetype of a late-type\ngalaxy formed by a relatively recent merger. Then late type, pseudo-bulge\nspirals are not mandatorily made through secular evolution, and the NGC 4013\nproperties also illustrate that strong warps in isolated galaxies may well\noccur at a late phase of a gas-rich major merger. \n\n"}

A major challenge for this method is separating the cosmic\nsignal from the foregrounds of Galactic and extra-Galactic origins that are\nstronger by many orders of magnitude than the former. The smooth frequency\nspectrum expected for the foregrounds would nominally contaminate only very\nsmall $k_\\parallel$ modes; however the chromatic response of the telescope\nantenna pattern at this wavelength to the foreground introduces non-smooth\nstructure, pervasively contaminating the cosmic signal over the physical scales\nof our interest. Such contamination defines a wedged volume in Fourier space\naround the transverse modes that is inaccessible for the cosmic signal. In this\npaper, we test the effect of this contaminated wedge on the future 21 cm BAO\nsurveys using Fisher information matrix calculation.

Our simulations include the effects of stellar and AGN feedback\nand are based on an improved version of the smoothed particle hydrodynamics\ncode GADGET-3, which ameliorates gas mixing and better captures gas-dynamical\ninstabilities by including a suitable artificial thermal diffusion. In this\nLetter, we focus our analysis on the entropy profiles, the primary diagnostic\nwe used to classify the degree of cool-coreness of clusters, and on the iron\nprofiles. In keeping with observations, our simulated clusters display a\nvariety of behaviors in entropy profiles: they range from steadily decreasing\nprofiles at small radii, characteristic of cool-core systems, to nearly flat\ncore isentropic profiles, characteristic of non-cool-core systems.

We consider the case of surveys for high-redshift\nLyman-alpha-emitting galaxies (LAEs), which have traditionally been classified\nvia an inferred rest-frame equivalent width (EW) greater than 20 angstrom. Our\nBayesian method relies on known prior probabilities in measured emission-line\nluminosity functions and equivalent width distributions for the galaxy\npopulations, and returns the probability that an object in question is an LAE\ngiven the characteristics observed. This approach will be directly relevant for\nthe Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX), which seeks to\nclassify ~10^6 emission-line galaxies into LAEs and low-redshift [O II]\nemitters. For a simulated HETDEX catalog with realistic measurement noise, our\nBayesian method recovers 86% of LAEs missed by the traditional EW > 20 angstrom\ncutoff over 2 < z < 3, outperforming the EW cut in both contamination and\nincompleteness. This is due to the method's ability to trade off between the\ntwo types of binary classification error by adjusting the stringency of the\nprobability requirement for classifying an observed object as an LAE. In our\nsimulations of HETDEX, this method reduces the uncertainty in cosmological\ndistance measurements by 14% with respect to the EW cut, equivalent to\nrecovering 29% more cosmological information. Rather than using binary object\nlabels, this method enables the use of classification probabilities in\nlarge-scale structure analyses.

These\nsimulations allow us to make substantial progress in mapping out the asymmetric\nthree-dimensional GHZ and its time evolution for the Milky Way (MW) and\nTriangulum (M33) galaxies, as opposed to works that generally assume an\nazimuthally symmetric GHZ.\n  Applying typical habitability metrics to MW and M33, we find that while a\nlarge number of habitable planets exist as close as a few kiloparsecs from the\ngalactic centre, the probability of individual planetary systems being\nhabitable rises as one approaches the edge of the stellar disc. Tidal streams\nand satellite galaxies also appear to be fertile grounds for habitable planet\nformation.\n  In short, we find that both galaxies arrive at similar GHZs by different\nevolutionary paths, as measured by the first and third quartiles of surviving\nbiospheres.

In such an\nenvironment, the disc evolution may differ significantly from ideal\nmagnetohydrodynamic predictions. We present non-ideal global axisymmetric\nsimulations of geometrically thick discs around a rotating black hole. The\nsimulations are carried out using a new code ${\\rm\\it grim}$, which evolves a\ncovariant extended magnetohydrodynamics model derived by treating non-ideal\neffects as a perturbation of ideal magnetohydrodynamics. Non-ideal effects are\nmodeled through heat conduction along magnetic field lines, and a difference\nbetween the pressure parallel and perpendicular to the field lines. The model\nrelies on an effective collisionality in the disc from wave-particle scattering\nand velocity-space (mirror and firehose) instabilities.

The pressure anisotropy produces\noutward angular momentum transport with a magnitude comparable to that of MHD\nturbulence in the disc, and a significant increase in the temperature in the\nwall of the jet.

One might even worry that in a de Sitter background, light species\nwill lead to a violation of the covariant entropy bound at large $N$. If so,\nrequiring the validity of the covariant entropy bound could limit the number of\nlight species and their couplings, which in turn could severely constrain\naxion-driven inflation.

Actually, dark energy affects the distances (and\nthe growth factor) by a further integration over functions of $H(z)$. Thus, the\ndirect measurements of the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ at different redshifts are\nof great importance for constraining the properties of dark energy. In this\npaper, we show how the typical dark energy models, for example, the\n$\\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, CPL, and holographic dark energy (HDE) models, can be\nconstrained by the current direct measurements of $H(z)$ (31 data in total,\ncovering the redshift range of $z\\in [0.07,2.34]$).

A possible resolution to\nthis conundrum is that many AGN are reddened by dust along the line of sight.\nTo explore this possibility, we stack 5000 SDSS AGN with luminosity\nL~10^45erg/s and redshift z~0.4 in bins of optical continuum slope alpha_opt\nand width of the broad H$\\beta$ emission line. We measure the EW of the NaID\nabsorption feature in each stacked spectrum. We find a linear relation between\nalpha_opt and EW(NaID), such that EW(NaID) increases as alpha_opt becomes\nredder. In the bin with the smallest H$\\beta$ width, objects with the bluest\nslopes that are similar to accretion disk predictions are found to have\nEW(NaID)=0, supporting the line-of-sight dust hypothesis. This conclusion is\nalso supported by the dependence of the $H\\alpha/H\\beta$ line ratio on\nalpha_opt. The implied relationship between alpha_opt and dust reddening is\ngiven by E(B-V)~0.2(-0.1-alpha_opt), and the implied reddening of a typical\ntype 1 AGN with alpha_opt=-0.5 is E(B-V)~0.08mag.

This means that present\ncosmological data are not accurate enough to distinguish clearly between both\ntheories. Among the different Galileon models, we found that a conformal\ncoupling is not favoured, contrary to the disformal coupling which is preferred\nat the $2.3\\sigma$ level over the uncoupled case. The tracker solution of the\nuncoupled Galileon model is also highly disfavoured due to large tensions with\nsupernovae and \\textit{Planck}+BAO data. However, outside of the tracker\nsolution, the general uncoupled Galileon model, as well as the general\ndisformally coupled Galileon model, remain the most promising Galileon\nscenarios to confront with future cosmological data.

For a model consisting of ICM, stellar mass from the central\ngalaxy (BCG), and an NFW dark matter (DM) halo, we obtain good descriptions of\nthe projected radial profiles of ICM emissivity and temperature. The BCG\nstellar mass is clearly detected with M_star/L_K = 0.61 +/- 0.11 solar,\nconsistent with stellar population synthesis models for a Milky-Way IMF.

For its mass, the inferred concentration is larger than\nmost relaxed halos produced in cosmological simulations with Planck parameters,\nconsistent with RXJ1159+5531 forming earlier than the general halo population.\nThe baryon fraction at r_200, f_b,200 = 0.134 +/- 0.007, is slightly below the\nPlanck value (0.155) for the universe. When we account for the stellar baryons\nassociated with non-central galaxies and the uncertain intracluster light,\nf_b,200 increases by ~0.015, consistent with the cosmic value. Performing our\nanalysis in the context of MOND still requires a large DM fraction (85.0% +/-\n2.5% at r=100 kpc) similar to that obtained using the standard Newtonian\napproach. The detection of a plausible stellar BCG mass component distinct from\nthe NFW DM halo in the total gravitational potential suggests that ~10^14 M_sun\nrepresents the mass scale above which dissipation is unimportant in the\nformation of the central regions of galaxy clusters.

The\nalignment of such grains depends on the so-called RAT parameter $q^{\\max}$ that\nis determined by the grain shape. In this paper, we elaborate our model of RAT\nalignment for grains with enhanced magnetic susceptibility due to iron\ninclusions, such that RAT alignment is magnetically enhanced for which we term\nMRAT mechanism. Such grains can get aligned with high angular momentum at the\nso-called high-J attractor points, achieving a high degree of alignment. Using\nour analytical model of RATs we derive the critical value of the magnetic\nrelaxation parameter $\\delta_{m}$ to produce high-J attractor points as\nfunctions of $q^{\\max}$ and the anisotropic radiation angle relative to the\nmagnetic field $\\psi$. We find that if about $10\\%$ of total iron abundance\npresent in silicate grains are forming iron clusters, it is sufficient to\nproduce high-J attractor points for all reasonable values of $q^{\\max}$. To\ncalculate the degree of grain alignment, we carry out numerical simulations of\nMRAT alignment by including stochastic excitations from gas collisions and\nmagnetic fluctuations.

We oppose this opinion\nand show that two main factors are responsible for the extremely low intensity\nof the observed stellar EBL: (1) a low mean surface brightness of galaxies,\nwhich causes a low luminosity density in the local Universe, and (2) light\nextinction due to absorption by galactic and intergalactic dust. Dust produces\na partial opacity of galaxies and of the Universe. The galactic opacity reduces\nthe intensity of light from more distant background galaxies obscured by\nforeground galaxies. The effective extinction AV for light passing through a\ngalaxy is 0.2 mag. This causes that distant background galaxies do not\ncontribute to the EBL significantly. In addition, light of distant galaxies is\ndimmed due to absorption by intergalactic dust. Even a minute intergalactic\nopacity of 1x10^(-2) mag per Gpc is high enough to produce significant effects\non the EBL. The absorbed starlight heats up the galactic and intergalactic dust\nand is further re-radiated at the IR, FIR and micro-wave spectrum. Assuming\nstatic infinite universe with no galactic and intergalactic dust, the stellar\nEBL should be as high as the surface brightness of stars. However, if dust is\nconsidered, the predicted stellar EBL is about 290 nWm^(-2)sr^(-1), which is\nonly 5 times higher than the observed value. Hence, the presence of dust has\nhigher impact on the EBL than currently assumed. In the expanding universe, the\ncalculated value of the EBL is further decreased, because the obscuration\neffect and intergalactic absorption become more pronounced at high redshifts\nwhen the matter was concentrated at smaller volume than at present. \n\n"}

Nearly independent of stellar mass, we observe a\nlarge range of half-light radii for the stars, from a few parsecs to a few\nhundred parsecs and surface brightnesses and mass-to-light ratios ranging from\nthose typical of globular clusters to ultra-faint dwarfs.

The relation has two characteristic\naccelerations; $a_0$, above which all galaxies are baryon-dominated; and\n$a_{\\rm min}$, an effective minimum aceleration probed by kinematic tracers in\nisolated galaxies. We use a simple model to show that these trends arise\nnaturally in $\\Lambda$CDM.

The limitations of the\njackknife covariance have been previously presented in the literature because\nit is effectively a rescaling of the covariance of the subsample area. However\nwe point out that subsampling is also biased, but for a different reason: the\nsubsamples are not independent, and the corresponding lack of power results in\nSSC underprediction. We develop the formalism in the case of cluster counts\nthat allows the bias of each covariance estimator to be exactly predicted. We\nfind significant effects for a small-scale area or when a low number of\nsubsamples is used, with auto-redshift biases ranging from 0.4% to 15% for\nsubsampling and from 5% to 75% for jackknife covariance estimates. The\ncross-redshift covariance is even more affected; biases range from 8% to 25%\nfor subsampling and from 50% to 90% for jackknife. Owing to the redshift\nevolution of the probe, the covariances cannot be debiased by a simple\nrescaling factor, and an exact debiasing has the same requirements as the full\nSSC prediction.

In this paper we consider the\nconstraints on both meanings of dark radiation based upon the newest results\nfor light-element nuclear reaction rates, observed light-element abundances and\nthe power spectrum of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Adding dark\nradiation during big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) alters the Friedmann expansion\nrate causing the nuclear reactions to freeze out at a different temperature.\nThis changes the final light element abundances at the end of BBN. Its\ninfluence on the CMB is to change the effective expansion rate at the surface\nof last scattering. We find that the BBN constraint reduces the allowed range\nfor both types of dark radiation at 10 Mev to between $-12.1\\%$ and $+6.2\\%$ of\nthe {\\bf total} background energy density at 10 Mev.

In order to explore its origin we study\nthe population of well-resolved galaxies in the Illustris cosmological\nsimulation.

We follow their evolution back in time using\nthe main progenitor branch galaxies of the Illustris merger trees. We find that\nthe emergence of prolate rotation is strongly correlated with the time of the\nlast significant merger the galaxy experienced, although other evolutionary\npaths leading to prolate rotation are also possible. The transition to prolate\nrotation most often happens around the same time as the transition to prolate\nshape of the stellar component. The mergers leading to prolate rotation have\nslightly more radial orbits, higher mass ratios, and occur at more recent times\nthan mergers in the reference sample of twin galaxies we construct for\ncomparison.

Some of these gradients resemble those in the\nMilky Way, where they have sometimes been interpreted as due to internal\nevolution, such as scattering off giant molecular clouds, radial migration\ndriven by spiral patterns, or orbital reso- nances with a bar. Secular\nprocesses play a minor role in the simulated galaxy, which lacks strong spiral\nor bar patterns, and where such gradients arise as a result of the gradual\nenrichment of a gaseous disc that is born thick but thins as it turns into\nstars and settles into centrifugal equilibrium. The settling is controlled by\nthe feedback of young stars; which links the star formation, enrichment, and\nequilibration timescales, inducing radial and vertical gradients in the gaseous\ndisc and its descendent stars. The kinematics of coeval stars evolve little\nafter birth and provide a faithful snapshot of the gaseous disc structure at\nthe time of their formation. In this interpretation, the age-velocity\ndispersion relation would reflect the gradual thinning of the disc rather than\nthe importance of secular orbit scattering; the outward flaring of stars would\nresult from the gas disc flare rather than from radial migration; and vertical\ngradients would arise because the gas disc gradually thinned as it enriched.\nSuch radial and vertical trends might just reflect the evolving properties of\nthe parent gaseous disc, and are not necessarily the result of secular\nevolutionary processes. \n\n"}

Our galaxy models exhibit a first burst of star\nformation that injects CRs at supernovae.

Likelihood-free inference methods allow us to\nperform Bayesian inference from these models using only forward simulations,\nfree from any likelihood assumptions or approximations. Likelihood-free\ninference generically involves simulating mock data and comparing to the\nobserved data; this comparison in data-space suffers from the curse of\ndimensionality and requires compression of the data to a small number of\nsummary statistics to be tractable. In this paper we use massive\nasymptotically-optimal data compression to reduce the dimensionality of the\ndata-space to just one number per parameter, providing a natural and optimal\nframework for summary statistic choice for likelihood-free inference. Secondly,\nwe present the first cosmological application of Density Estimation\nLikelihood-Free Inference (\\textsc{delfi}), which learns a parameterized model\nfor joint distribution of data and parameters, yielding both the parameter\nposterior and the model evidence. This approach is conceptually simple,\nrequires less tuning than traditional Approximate Bayesian Computation\napproaches to likelihood-free inference and can give high-fidelity posteriors\nfrom orders of magnitude fewer forward simulations. As an additional bonus, it\nenables parameter inference and Bayesian model comparison simultaneously.

While there can be other signatures of cosmological\nmagnetic fields, a signature in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) would\nprove their primordial origin. The B-mode polarization of CMB is particularly\npromising in this regard because there are relatively few other sources of\nB-modes, and because the vortical modes sourced by the primordial magnetic\nfield (PMF) survive diffusion damping up to a small fraction of the Silk\nlength. At present, the Planck temperature and polarization spectra combined\nwith the B-mode spectrum measured by the South Pole Telescope (SPT) constrain\nthe PMF strength to be no more than $\\sim 1$ nano-Gauss (nG). Because of the\nquartic scaling of the CMB anisotropy spectra with the PMF strength, this bound\nwill not change by much even with the significantly better measurements of the\nB-mode spectrum by the Stage III and Stage IV CMB experiments.

To better interpret current and future spectroscopic galaxy\nredshift surveys, it is important to be able to simulate these data sets. We\ndescribe Uspec, a forward modeling tool to generate galaxy spectra taking into\naccount some intrinsic galaxy properties as well as instrumental responses of a\ngiven telescope. The model for the intrinsic properties of the galaxy\npopulation, i.e., the luminosity functions, and size and spectral coefficients\ndistribu- tions, was developed in an earlier work for broad-band imaging\nsurveys [1], and we now aim to test the model further using spectroscopic data.\nWe apply Uspec to the SDSS/CMASS sample of Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs). We\nconstruct selection cuts that match those used to build this LRG sample, which\nwe then apply to data and simulations in the same way. The resulting real and\nsimulated average spectra show a good statistical agreement overall, with\nresidual differences likely coming from a bluer galaxy population of the\nsimulated sam- ple. We also do not explore the impact of non-solar element\nratios in our simulations. For a quantitative comparison, we perform Principal\nComponent Analysis (PCA) of the sets of spectra. By comparing the PCs\nconstructed from simulations and data, we find good agree- ment for all\ncomponents. The distributions of the eigencoefficients also show an appreciable\noverlap. We are therefore able to properly simulate the LRG sample taking into\naccount the SDSS/BOSS instrumental responses. The differences between the two\nsamples can be ascribed to the intrinsic properties of the simulated galaxy\npopulation, which can be reduced by further improvements of our modelling\nmethod in the future. We discuss how these results can be useful for the\nforward modeling of upcoming large spectroscopic surveys. \n\n"}

Stars are projected back to their birth positions according to\nthe observationally derived age and [Fe/H] with no kinematical information\nrequired.

We find that the data are consistent with an ISM radial\nmetallicity gradient that flattens with time from ~-0.15 dex/kpc at the\nbeginning of disk formation, to its measured present-day value (-0.07 dex/kpc).\nWe present several chemo-kinematical relations in terms of mono-r_birth\npopulations.

This phenomenon can be also seen in the observed\nage-velocity dispersion relation, in that its upper boundary is dominated by\nstars born at larger radii.

Using an analytical\nmodel and numerical simulations of the evolving spherical wall we show that the\nspherical wall experiences a repelling gravitational potential due to the mass\nof the central black hole. This potential is further amplified by the presence\nof a cosmological constant.

In analogy with the standard theory of accretion discs, our theory is\nbased on shear viscous forces among nested annuli of gas. However, the fact\nthat gas follows non circular orbits in an external barred potential has\nprofound consequences: it creates a region of reverse shear in which it is\nenergetically favourable to form a stable ring which does not spread despite\ndissipation. Our theory allows us to approximately predict the size of the ring\ngiven the underlying gravitational potential. The size of the ring is loosely\nrelated to the location of the Inner Lindblad Resonance in the epicyclic\napproximation, but the predicted location is more accurate and is also valid\nfor strongly barred potentials.

The analysis of the light curves yields that the dust echo is\nrather sharp and symmetric in contrast to the more complex broad H alpha BLR\necho. We investigate how far this supports an optically thick bowl-shaped BLR\nand dust torus geometry as proposed by Kawaguchi & Mori (2010) and Goad et al.\n(2012). The comparison with several parameterizations of these models supports\nthe following geometry: the BLR clouds lie inside the bowl closely above the\nbowl rim, up to a half covering angle 0 deg < theta < 40 deg (measured against\nthe equatorial plane). Then the BLR is spread over many isodelay surfaces,\nyielding a smeared and structured echo as observed. Furthermore, if the BLR\nclouds shield the bottom of the bowl rim against radiation from the nucleus,\nthe hot dust emission comes essentially from the top edge of the bowl (40 deg <\ntheta < 45 deg). Then, for small inclinations as for 3C120, the top dust edge\nforms a ring which largely coincides with a narrow range of isodelay surfaces,\nyielding the observed sharp dust echo. The scale height of the BLR increases\nwith radial distance from the black hole. This leads to luminosity dependent\nforeshortening effects of the lag. We discuss implications and possible\ncorrections of the foreshortening for the black hole mass determination and\nconsequences for the lag (size) - luminosity relationships and the difference\nto interferometric torus sizes. \n\n"}

An important distinguishing\ncharacteristic for nonparametric models is the characteristic timescale for\nchanges in SFR(t). This difference controls whether galaxies are assembled in\nbursts or in steady-state star formation, corresponding respectively to\n(feedback-dominated/accretion-dominated) models of galaxy formation and to\n(larger/smaller) confidence intervals derived from SED-fitting. High-quality\nspectroscopy has the potential to further distinguish between these proposed\nmodels of SFR(t). \n\n"}

Their dark-matter haloes have ordinary spin parameters and\ncentrally dominant dark-matter cores. Their stellar components tend to have a\nprolate shape with a Sersic index n~1 but no significant rotation. Ram pressure\nremoves the gas from the group UDGs when they are at pericentre, quenching star\nformation in them and making them redder.

One open question, in\nparticular, is the effect of major mergers on halo structure. We have performed\na large set of simulations of binary equal-mass mergers between isolated haloes\nwith various density profiles, to map out the relationship between the initial\nconditions and merger parameters and the structure of the final remnant.

The star formation history of DGSAT I\nseems to be extended, with a mean luminosity-weighted age of ~3 Gyr, in\nagreement with previous photometric studies.

On long timescales, the NGC 1399 sources are steadier\nthan most Galactic black hole X-ray binaries, but similar to GRS 1915+105. The\noutburst duration of the NGC 1399 sources is about 20 yrs, again, similar to\nthat of GRS 1915+105. The bright X-ray sources in NGC 1399 may be black hole\nX-ray binaries with giant star companions similar to GRS 1915+105. The\nbrightest ULX (PSX-1) in NGC 1399 is coincident with a globular cluster, shows\na hard spectrum with a photon index around 1.5, and has a nearly constant\nluminosity around 5x10^39 erg/s. It may be an intermediate-mass black hole\n(IMBH) in a hard spectral state. In contrast to NGC 1399, the ULXs in the\nAntennae are all variable and a large fraction of the bright sources (9 of 15)\nare also variable. The variability and luminosity of ULXs in the Antennae\nsuggest they are black hole high mass X-ray binaries accreting via Roche-lobe\noverflow. A flare with a duration of about 5 ks is found from Antennae X-42.\nThe most luminous ULX, X-16, with a very hard spectrum (Gamma=1.0~1.3) and a\nluminosity which varies by a factor of 10, could be an IMBH candidate. \n\n"}

We present the results of our ongoing\nspectroscopic observations of gravitationally lensed quasars in order to\nmeasure the redshift of their lensing galaxies. We report on the determination\nof the lens redshift in seven gravitationally lensed systems.\n  Methods: Our deep VLT/FORS1 spectra are spatially deconvolved in order to\nseparate the spectrum of the lensing galaxies from the glare of the much\nbrighter quasar images. Our observing strategy involves observations in\nMulti-Object-Spectroscopy (MOS) mode which allows the simultaneous observation\nof the target and of several crucial PSF and flux calibration stars. The\nadvantage of this method over traditional long-slit observations is that it\nallows a much more reliable extraction and flux calibration of the spectra.\n  Results: We obtain the first reliable spectra of the lensing galaxies in six\nlensed quasars: FBQ 0951+2635 (z=0.260), BRI 0952-0115 (z=0.632), HE 2149-2745\n(z=0.603), Q 0142-100 (z=0.491), SDSS J0246-0825 (z=0.723), and SDSS J0806+2006\n(z=0.573). The last 3 redshifts also correspond to the MgII doublet seen in\nabsorption in the quasar spectra at the lens redshift. Our spectroscopic\nredshifts of HE 2149-2745 and FBQ 0951+2635 are higher than previously\nreported, which means that H_0 estimates from these two systems must be revised\nto higher values. Finally, we reanalyse our spectra of Q 1355-2257 and find\nMgII in absorption at z=0.702, confirming our previous redshift estimate. The\nspectra of all lenses are typical of early-type galaxies. \n\n"}

For Cold Dark Matter cosmologies, the radiation\nproduced by the first baryonic objects is expected to ionize the Universe at\nz=10-20 and consequently suppress by 10% the amplitude of microwave\nanisotropies on angular scales <10 degrees. Future microwave anisotropy\nsatellites will be able to detect this signature. The production and mixing of\nmetals by an early population of stars provides a natural explanation to the\nmetallicity, ~1% solar, found in the intergalactic medium at redshifts z<5. The\nNext Generation Space Telescope (NGST) will be able to image directly the\n``first light'' from these stars. With its nJy sensitivity, NGST is expected to\ndetect >10^3 star clusters per square arcminute at z>10. The brightest sources,\nhowever, might be early quasars. The infrared flux from an Eddington\nluminosity, 10^6 solar mass, black hole at z=10 is 10 nJy at 1 micron, easily\ndetectable with NGST. The time it takes a black hole with a radiative\nefficiency of 10% to double its mass amounts to more than a tenth of the Hubble\ntime at z=10, and so a fair fraction of all systems which harbor a central\nblack hole at this redshift would appear active. The redshift of all sources\ncan be determined from the Lyman-limit break in their spectrum, which overlaps\nwith the NGST wavelength regime, 1-3.5 micron, for 10<z<35. Absorption spectra\nof the first generation of star clusters or quasars would reveal the\nreionization history of the Universe. The intergalactic medium might show a\nsignificant opacity to infrared sources at z>10 due to dust produced by the\nfirst supernovae. \n\n"}

The PLANET data, consisting of 46 V-band and 325 I-band observations\nfrom five southern observatories, span a period from the initial alert until\nthe end of the event. Our data are incompatible with a static binary lens, but\nare well fit by a rotating binary lens of mass ratio q=0.34 and angular\nseparation d ~ 0.5 (in units of the Einstein ring radius) in which the binary\nseparation changes in size by delta d = -0.070 +/- 0.009 and in orientation by\ndelta theta = (5.61 +/- 0.36) degrees during the 35.17 days between the\nseparate caustic transits. We use this measurement combined with other\nobservational constraints to derive the first kinematic estimate of the mass,\ndistance, and period of a binary microlens. The relative probability\ndistributions for these parameters peak at a total lens mass M ~ 0.3 solar\nmasses (M-dwarf binary system), lens distance D_L ~ 5.5 kpc, and binary period\nP ~ 1.5 yr. The robustness of our model is demonstrated by its striking\nagreement with MACHO/GMAN data that cover several sharp features in the light\ncurve not probed by the PLANET observations, and which did not enter our\nmodeling procedure in any way. Available data sets thus indicate that the light\ncurve of MACHO 97-BLG-41 can be modeled as a source crossing two caustics of a\nphysically-realistic rotating binary so that, contrary to a recent suggestion,\nthe additional effects of a postulated planetary companion to the binary lens\nare not required. \n\n"}

Abstract: The current observations seem to suggest that the universe has a positive\ncosmological constant of the order of $H_0^2$ while the most natural value for\nthe cosmological constant will be $L_P^{-2}$ where $L_P = (G\\hbar/c^3)^{1/2}$\nis the Planck length. This reduction of the cosmological constant from\n$L_P^{-2} $ to $L_P^{-2}(L_PH_0)^2$ may be interpreted as due to the ability of\nquantum micro structure of spacetime to readjust itself and absorb bulk vacuum\nenergy densities. Being a quantum mechanical process, such a cancellation\ncannot be exact and the residual quantum fluctuations appear as the ``small''\ncosmological constant. I describe the features of a toy model for the spacetime\nmicro structure which could allow for the bulk vacuum energy densities to be\ncanceled leaving behind a small residual value of the the correct magnitude.\nSome other models (like the ones based on canonical ensemble for the four\nvolume or quantum fluctuations of the horizon size) lead to an insignificantly\nsmall value of $H_0^2(L_PH_0)^n$ with $n=0.5-1$ showing that obtaining the\ncorrect order of magnitude for the residual fluctuations in the cosmological\nconstant is a nontrivial task, becaue of the existence of the small\ndimensionless number $H_0L_P$ . \n\n"}
