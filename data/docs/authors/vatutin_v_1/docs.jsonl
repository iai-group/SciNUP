The performance of phylogenetic reconstruction methods where\nthe underlying data is generated by a mixture model has stimulated considerable\nrecent debate. Much of the controversy stems from simulations of mixture model\ndata on a given tree topology for which reconstruction algorithms output a tree\nof a different topology; these findings were held up to show the shortcomings\nof particular tree reconstruction methods.

To investigate the theoretical\nproperties of consensus trees that would be obtained from large numbers of loci\nevolving according to a basic evolutionary model, we construct consensus trees\nfrom independent gene trees that occur in proportion to gene tree probabilities\nderived from coalescent theory. We consider majority-rule, rooted triple (R*),\nand greedy consensus trees constructed from known gene trees, both in the\nasymptotic case as numbers of gene trees approach infinity and for finite\nnumbers of genes. Our results show that for some combinations of species tree\nbranch lengths, increasing the number of independent loci can make the\nmajority-rule consensus tree more likely to be at least partially unresolved\nand the greedy consensus tree less likely to match the species tree. However,\nthe probability that the R* consensus tree has the species tree topology\napproaches 1 as the number of gene trees approaches infinity.

Here we introduce a general framework for\nthe study of bosonic reaction-diffusion processes on complex networks, in which\nthere is no restriction on the number of interacting particles that a vertex\ncan host. We describe these processes theoretically by means of continuous time\nheterogeneous mean-field theory and divide them into two main classes: steady\nstate and monotonously decaying processes.

We start from Lotka-Volterra equations and the modelling of simple\ntwo-species prey-predator systems. Such systems are canonical example for\nstudying oscillatory behaviour in competitive populations. Then we describe\nvarious approaches to study long-term evolution of multi-species ecosystems. We\nemphasize the need to use models that take into account both ecological and\nevolutionary processes. Finally, we address the problem of the emergence and\ndevelopment of language. It is becoming more and more evident that any theory\nof language origin and development must be consistent with darwinian principles\nof evolution. Consequently, a number of techniques developed for modelling\nevolution of complex ecosystems are being applied to the problem of language.\nWe briefly review some of these approaches. \n\n"}

The mean return time of the walk is in\nessence given by the total conductance of the tree. We determine the asymptotic\ndecay of this total conductance, finding it to have a pure power-law decay. In\nthe case of the conductance associated to a single vertex at maximal depth in\nthe tree, this asymptotic decay may be analysed by the classical defective\nrenewal theorem, due to the non-lattice edge-bias assumption.\n  However, the derivation of the decay for total conductance requires computing\nan additional constant multiple outside the power-law that allows for the\ncontribution of all vertices close to the base of the tree. This computation\nentails a detailed study of a convenient decomposition of the tree, under\nconditioning on the tree having high total conductance.

The effect they described\nis quantified as the fitness-abundance covariance. The phase in the life cycle\nwhere the population is censused is crucial for the implications of the\nfitness-abundance covariance.

{"id": "1109.5630", "contents": "Title: Natural selection. I. Variable environments and uncertain returns on\n  investment Abstract: Many studies have analyzed how variability in reproductive success affects\nfitness. However, each study tends to focus on a particular problem, leaving\nunclear the overall structure of variability in populations. This fractured\nconceptual framework often causes particular applications to be incomplete or\nimproperly analyzed. In this paper, I present a concise introduction to the two\nkey aspects of the theory. First, all measures of fitness ultimately arise from\nthe relative comparison of the reproductive success of individuals or genotypes\nwith the average reproductive success in the population. That relative measure\ncreates a diminishing relation between reproductive success and fitness.\nDiminishing returns reduce fitness in proportion to variability in reproductive\nsuccess. The relative measurement of success also induces a frequency\ndependence that favors rare types. Second, variability in populations has a\nhierarchical structure. Variable success in different traits of an individual\naffects that individual's variation in reproduction. Correlation between\ndifferent individuals' reproduction affects variation in the aggregate success\nof particular alleles across the population. One must consider the hierarchical\nstructure of variability in relation to different consequences of temporal,\nspatial, and developmental variability. Although a complete analysis of\nvariability has many separate parts, this simple framework allows one to see\nthe structure of the whole and to place particular problems in their proper\nrelation to the general theory. The biological understanding of relative\nsuccess and the hierarchical structure of variability in populations may also\ncontribute to a deeper economic theory of returns under uncertainty. \n\n"}
{"id": "1109.5633", "contents": "Title: Natural selection. II. Developmental variability and evolutionary rate Abstract: In classical evolutionary theory, genetic variation provides the source of\nheritable phenotypic variation on which natural selection acts. Against this\nclassical view, several theories have emphasized that developmental variability\nand learning enhance nonheritable phenotypic variation, which in turn can\naccelerate evolutionary response. In this paper, I show how developmental\nvariability alters evolutionary dynamics by smoothing the landscape that\nrelates genotype to fitness. In a fitness landscape with multiple peaks and\nvalleys, developmental variability can smooth the landscape to provide a\ndirectly increasing path of fitness to the highest peak. Developmental\nvariability also allows initial survival of a genotype in response to novel or\nextreme environmental challenge, providing an opportunity for subsequent\nadaptation. This initial survival advantage arises from the way in which\ndevelopmental variability smooths and broadens the fitness landscape.\nUltimately, the synergism between developmental processes and genetic variation\nsets evolutionary rate. \n\n"}

An important goal of these studies is discerning which\nevolutionary pressures favor the formation of swarms. One hypothesis is that\nswarms arise because the presence of multiple moving prey in swarms causes\nconfusion for attacking predators, but it remains unclear how important this\nselective force is. Using an evolutionary model of a predator-prey system, we\nshow that predator confusion provides a sufficient selection pressure to evolve\nswarming behavior in prey. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the evolutionary\neffect of predator confusion on prey could in turn exert pressure on the\nstructure of the predator's visual field, favoring the frontally oriented,\nhigh-resolution visual systems commonly observed in predators that feed on\nswarming animals. Finally, we provide evidence that when prey evolve swarming\nin response to predator confusion, there is a change in the shape of the\nfunctional response curve describing the predator's consumption rate as prey\ndensity increases. Thus, we show that a relatively simple perceptual\nconstraint--predator confusion--could have pervasive evolutionary effects on\nprey behavior, predator sensory mechanisms, and the ecological interactions\nbetween predators and prey. \n\n"}

We propose\nnew techniques that allow to disentangle the respective contributions of\ndemography and dispersal to the dynamics and fate of a single species in a\nsource-sink metapopulation.

{"id": "1302.1293", "contents": "Title: Implications of the Reduction Principle for Cosmological Natural\n  Selection Abstract: Smolin (1992) proposed that the fine-tuning problem for parameters of the\nStandard Model might be accounted for by a Darwinian process of universe\nreproduction - Cosmological Natural Selection (CNS) - in which black holes give\nrise to offspring universes with slightly altered parameters. The laws for\nvariation and inheritance of the parameters are also subject to CNS if\nvariation in transmission laws occurs. This is the strategy introduced by Nei\n(1967) to understand genetic transmission, through the evolutionary theory of\nmodifier genes, whose methodology is adopted here. When mechanisms of variation\nthemselves vary, they are subject to Feldman's (1972) evolutionary Reduction\nPrinciple that selection favors greater faithfulness of replication. A theorem\nof Karlin (1982) allows one to generalize this principle beyond biological\ngenetics to the unknown inheritance laws that would operate in CNS. The\nreduction principle for CNS is illustrated with a general multitype branching\nprocess model of universe creation containing competing inheritance laws. The\nmost faithful inheritance law dominates the ensemble of universes. The\nReduction Principle thus provides a mechanism to account for high fidelity of\ninheritance between universes. Moreover, it reveals that natural selection in\nthe presence of variation in inheritance mechanisms has two distinct objects:\nmaximization of both fitness and faithful inheritance. Tradeoffs between\nfitness and faithfulness open the possibility that evolved fundamental\nparameters are compromises, and not local optima to maximize universe\nproduction, in which case their local non-optimality may point to their\ninvolvement in the universe inheritance mechanisms. \n\n"}

Alternatively, reconstructed trees\ncan be modelled by coalescent point processes (CPP), where trees grow\n\"horizontally\" by the sequential addition of vertical edges. Each new edge\nstarts at some random speciation time and ends at the present time; speciation\ntimes are drawn from the same distribution independently. CPP lead to extremely\nfast computation of tree likelihoods and simulation of reconstructed trees.\nTheir topology always follows the uniform distribution on ranked tree shapes\n(URT). We characterize which forward-time models lead to URT reconstructed\ntrees and among these, which lead to CPP reconstructed trees.

Population\ndynamics are driven by births and deaths, mutations at birth, and competition\nbetween individuals. Trait values influence ecological processes (demographic\nevents, competition), and competition generates selection on trait variation,\nthus closing the eco-evolutionary feedback loop. The demographic effects of the\ntrait are also expected to influence the generation and maintenance of neutral\nvariation. We consider a large population limit with rare mutation, under the\nassumption that the neutral marker mutates faster than the trait under\nselection.

A\nunified framework is first set forth, which covers important cases of additive\nand multiplicative noises. Within this framework, the proposed scheme is shown\nto converge uniformly in the strong $L^p$-sense with precise convergence rates\ngiven. The abstract results are then applied to several concrete examples.\nFurther, weak convergence rates of the scheme are examined for the case of\nadditive noise. To analyze the weak error for the nonlinear case, techniques\nbased on the Malliavin calculus were usually exploited in the literature. Under\ncertain appropriate assumptions on the nonlinearity, this paper provides a weak\nerror analysis, which does not rely on the Malliavin calculus. The rates of\nweak convergence can, as expected, be improved in comparison with the strong\nrates. Both strong and weak convergence results obtained here show that the\nproposed method achieves higher convergence rates than the implicit Euler and\nCrank-Nicolson time discretizations.

This is also a variant of the so-called chase-escape process\nintroduced by Kordzakhia and then Bordenave & Ganesan. Our work is the first\nstudy of this dynamics on complete graphs. Starting with one infected and one\nrecovered individuals on the complete graph with $N+2$ vertices, and stopping\nthe process when one type of individuals disappears, we study the asymptotic\nbehavior of the probability that the infection spreads to the whole graph as\n$N\\rightarrow\\infty$ and show that for $\\lambda\\in (0,1)$ (resp. for\n$\\lambda>1$), the infection dies out (resp. does not die out) with probability\ntending to one as $N\\rightarrow\\infty$, and that the probability that the\ninfection dies out tends to $1/2$ for $\\lambda=1$.

{"id": "1405.4896", "contents": "Title: Diffusion Limit For The Random Walk Metropolis Algorithm Out Of\n  stationarity Abstract: The Random Walk Metropolis (RWM) algorithm is a Metropolis- Hastings MCMC\nalgorithm designed to sample from a given target distribution \\pi with Lebesgue\ndensity on R^N. RWM constructs a Markov chain by randomly proposing a new\nposition (the \"proposal move\"), which is then accepted or rejected according to\na rule which makes the chain reversible with respect to \\pi. When the dimension\nN is large a key question is to determine the optimal scaling with N of the\nproposal variance: if the proposal variance is too large, the algorithm will\nreject the proposed moves too often; if it is too small, the algorithm will\nexplore the state space too slowly. Determining the optimal scaling of the\nproposal variance gives a measure of the cost of the algorithm as well. One\napproach to tackle this issue, which we adopt here, is to derive diffusion\nlimits for the algorithm. Such an approach has been proposed in the seminal\npapers [RGG97, RR98]; in particular in [RGG97] the authors derive a diffusion\nlimit for the RWM algorithm under the two following assumptions: i) the\nalgorithm is started in stationarity; ii) the target measure $\\pi$ is in\nproduct form. The present paper considers the situation of practical interest\nin which both assumptions i) and ii) are removed. That is a) we study the case\n(which occurs in practice) in which the algorithm is started out of\nstationarity and b) we consider target measures which are in non-product form.\nThe target measures that we consider arise in Bayesian nonparametric statistics\nand in the study of conditioned diffusions. We prove that, out of stationarity,\nthe optimal scaling for the proposal variance is O(N), as it is in\nstationarity. Notice that the optimal scaling in and out of stationatity need\nnot be the same in general, and indeed they differ e.g. in the case of the MALA\nalgorithm [KOS16]. \n\n"}

I show that (under certain\nsimplifying assumptions) the probability to discover a self-replicator by\nchance depends exponentially on the rate of formation of the monomers. If the\nrate at which monomers are formed is somewhat similar to the rate at which they\nwould occur in a self-replicating polymer, the likelihood to discover such a\nreplicator by chance is increased by many orders of magnitude. I document such\nan increase in searches for a self-replicator within the digital life system\navida \n\n"}

{"id": "1410.0587", "contents": "Title: The effect of spatial scales on the reproductive fitness of plant\n  pathogens Abstract: Plant diseases often cause serious yield losses in agriculture. A pathogen's\nreproductive fitness can be quantified by the basic reproductive number, R0.\nSince pathogen transmission between host plants depends on the spatial\nseparation between them, R0 is strongly influenced by the spatial scales of\npathogen dispersal and the spatial scales of the host population. The basic\nreproductive number was found to increase with the field size at small field\nsizes and to saturate to a constant value at large field sizes. It reaches a\nmaximum in quadratic fields and decreases as the field becomes elongated. This\npattern appears to be quite general: it holds for dispersal kernels that\ndecrease exponentially or faster as well as for \"fat-tailed\" dispersal kernels\nthat decrease slower than exponential (i.e. power-law kernels). We used this\napproach to estimate R0 in wheat stripe rust (an important pathogen caused by\nPuccinia striiformis), since disease gradients for this pathogen were\nthoroughly measured over large distances [Sackett and Mundt, Phytopathology,\n95, 983 (2005)].

Here, we examine\none component of Ebola dynamics that is of growing concern -- the transmission\nof Ebola from the dead to the living. We do so by applying the toolkit of\nmathematical epidemiology to analyze the consequences of post-death\ntransmission. We show that underlying disease parameters cannot be inferred\nwith confidence from early-stage incidence data (that is, they are not\n\"identifiable\") because different parameter combinations can produce virtually\nthe same epidemic trajectory. Despite this identifiability problem, we find\nrobustly that inferences that don't account for post-death transmission tend to\nunderestimate the basic reproductive number -- thus, given the observed rate of\nepidemic growth, larger amounts of post-death transmission imply larger\nreproductive numbers.

Theory Related Fields, 152(3-4):781-807, 2012], and we follow\nthe martingale approach developed there and in subsequent publications. Besides\nadditional technical difficulties in estimating error bounds for transition\nrates, the thermodynamic limit requires new estimates for equilibration towards\na suitably defined distribution in metastable wells, corresponding to a typical\nset of configurations with a particular condensate location. The total exit\nrates from individual wells turn out to diverge in the limit, which requires an\nintermediate regularization step using the symmetries of the process and the\nregularity of the limit generator. Another important novel contribution is a\ncoupling construction to provide a uniform bound on the exit rates from\nmetastable wells, which is of a general nature and can be adapted to other\nmodels. \n\n"}

If the number of\nentities is large, accounting for each individual is inefficient, and often\npartial differential equation (PDE) models are used in which the stochastic\nbehaviour of individuals is replaced by a description of the averaged, or mean\nbehaviour of the system. In some situations the number of individuals is large\nin certain regions and small in others. In such cases, a stochastic model may\nbe inefficient in one region, and a PDE model inaccurate in another. To\novercome this problem, we develop a scheme which couples a stochastic\nreaction-diffusion system in one part of the domain with its mean field\nanalogue, i.e. a discretised PDE model, in the other part of the domain. The\ninterface in between the two domains occupies exactly one lattice site and is\nchosen such that the mean field description is still accurate there.

We consider a stochastic\nindividual-based pure jump process taking values in the space of point\nmeasures, and whose jump events describe the individual reproduction, transfer\nand death mechanisms. In a large population scale, the stochastic process is\nproved to converge to the solution of a nonlinear integro-differential\nequation. When there are only two different traits and no mutation, this\nequation reduces to a non-standard two-dimensional dynamical system. We show\nhow crucial the forms of the transfer rates are for the long-term behavior of\nits solutions. We describe the dynamics of invasion and fixation when one of\nthe two traits is initially rare, and compute the invasion probabilities. Then,\nwe study the process under the assumption of rare mutations.

In this process, individuals are the vertices of a connected graph $G$.\nInitially, there is a single mutant vertex, chosen uniformly at random. In each\nstep, a random vertex is selected for reproduction with a probability\nproportional to its fitness: mutants have fitness $r>1$, while non-mutants have\nfitness 1. The vertex chosen to reproduce places a copy of itself to a\nuniformly random neighbor in $G$, replacing the individual that was there. The\nprocess ends when the mutation either reaches fixation (i.e., all vertices are\nmutants), or gets extinct. The principal quantity of interest is the\nprobability with which each of the two outcomes occurs.\n  A problem that has received significant attention recently concerns the\nexistence of families of graphs, called strong amplifiers of selection, for\nwhich the fixation probability tends to 1 as the order $n$ of the graph\nincreases, and the existence of strong suppressors of selection, for which this\nprobability tends to 0. For the case of directed graphs, it is known that both\nstrong amplifiers and suppressors exist. For the case of undirected graphs,\nhowever, the problem has remained open, and the general belief has been that\nneither strong amplifiers nor suppressors exist.

The food chain we analyze\nconsists of one prey and $n-1$ predators.

However, if the environmental fluctuations are\nsmall, persistence in the deterministic setting is preserved in the stochastic\nsystem. Our analysis also shows that the addition of a new apex predator makes,\nas expected, the different species more prone to extinction.\n  Another novelty of our analysis is the fact that we can describe the behavior\nthe system when the noise is degenerate.

Many more such statements have been\nconjectured. Since the mated-CRT map can be viewed as a coarse-grained\napproximation to other random planar maps (the UIPT, tree-weighted maps,\nbipolar-oriented maps, etc.), our results indicate a potential approach for\nproving that embeddings of these maps converge to LQG as well.\n  To prove the main result, we establish several (independently interesting)\ntheorems about LQG surfaces decorated by space-filling SLE.

We\nare primarily interested in situations where the function class as well as the\nunderlying distribution change with the sample size, and the $U$-process itself\nis not weakly convergent as a process. Such situations arise in a variety of\nmodern statistical problems. We first consider Gaussian approximations, namely,\napproximate the $U$-process supremum by the supremum of a Gaussian process, and\nderive coupling and Kolmogorov distance bounds. Such Gaussian approximations\nare, however, not often directly applicable in statistical problems since the\ncovariance function of the approximating Gaussian process is unknown.

Here, we report on a previously unknown phenomenon when\nembodied agents are allowed to develop and evolve: Evolution discovers body\nplans robust to control changes, these body plans become genetically\nassimilated, yet controllers for these agents are not assimilated.

Earlier work proposed prescriptive formulations based on\nsupervised machine learning methods. These prescriptive methods can factor in\ncontextual information on a potentially large number of covariates to take\ncontext specific actions which are superior to any static decision. When\nworking with noisy or corrupt data, however, such nominal prescriptive methods\ncan be prone to adverse overfitting phenomena and fail to generalize on\nout-of-sample data.

Abstract: Technological advances have led to a strong increase in the number of data\ncollection efforts aimed at measuring co-presence of individuals at different\nspatial resolutions. It is however unclear how much co-presence data can inform\nus on actual face-to-face contacts, of particular interest to study the\nstructure of a population in social groups or for use in data-driven models of\ninformation or epidemic spreading processes. Here, we address this issue by\nleveraging data sets containing high resolution face-to-face contacts as well\nas a coarser spatial localisation of individuals, both temporally resolved, in\nvarious contexts. The co-presence and the face-to-face contact temporal\nnetworks share a number of structural and statistical features, but the former\nis (by definition) much denser than the latter. We thus consider several\ndown-sampling methods that generate surrogate contact networks from the\nco-presence signal and compare them with the real face-to-face data. We show\nthat these surrogate networks reproduce some features of the real data but are\nonly partially able to identify the most central nodes of the face-to-face\nnetwork.

In this manuscript, we explore the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered\n(SIR) model with local dynamic vaccination, and considering limited vaccines.\nIn this model, susceptibles in contact with an infected individual, are\nvaccinated -with probability $\\omega$- and then get infected -with probability\n$\\beta$. However, when the fraction of immunized individuals reaches a\nthreshold $V_L$, the vaccination stops, after which only the infection is\npossible.

The information expressions typically\nhave analogous interpretations as the Newtonian balance between force and\nacceleration, representing a partition between direct causes of change and\nopposing changes in the frame of reference. This web of vague analogies hints\nat a deeper common mathematical structure. I suggest that the Price equation\nexpresses that underlying universal structure. The abstract Price equation\ndescribes dynamics as the change between two sets. One component of dynamics\nexpresses the change in the frequency of things, holding constant the values\nassociated with things. The other component of dynamics expresses the change in\nthe values of things, holding constant the frequency of things. The separation\nof frequency from value generalizes Shannon's separation of the frequency of\nsymbols from the meaning of symbols in information theory. The Price equation's\ngeneralized separation of frequency and value reveals a few simple invariances\nthat define universal geometric aspects of change. For example, the\nconservation of total frequency, although a trivial invariance by itself,\ncreates a powerful constraint on the geometry of change. That constraint plus a\nfew others seem to explain the common structural forms of the equations in\ndifferent disciplines. From that abstract perspective, interpretations such as\nselection, information, entropy, force, acceleration, and physical work arise\nfrom the same underlying geometry expressed by the Price equation. \n\n"}

Both models consist of\nsystems of economical agents located on a finite connected graph representing a\nsocial network.

Abstract: We analytically study the dynamics of evolving populations that exhibit\nmetastability on the level of phenotype or fitness. In constant selective\nenvironments, such metastable behavior is caused by two qualitatively different\nmechanisms. One the one hand, populations may become pinned at a local fitness\noptimum, being separated from higher-fitness genotypes by a {\\em fitness\nbarrier} of low-fitness genotypes. On the other hand, the population may only\nbe metastable on the level of phenotype or fitness while, at the same time,\ndiffusing over {\\em neutral networks} of selectively neutral genotypes.\nMetastability occurs in this case because the population is separated from\nhigher-fitness genotypes by an {\\em entropy barrier}: The population must\nexplore large portions of these neutral networks before it discovers a rare\nconnection to fitter phenotypes.\n  We derive analytical expressions for the barrier crossing times in both the\nfitness barrier and entropy barrier regime. In contrast with ``landscape''\nevolutionary models, we show that the waiting times to reach higher fitness\ndepend strongly on the width of a fitness barrier and much less on its height.\nThe analysis further shows that crossing entropy barriers is faster by orders\nof magnitude than fitness barrier crossing. Thus, when populations are trapped\nin a metastable phenotypic state, they are most likely to escape by crossing an\nentropy barrier, along a neutral path in genotype space. If no such escape\nroute along a neutral path exists, a population is most likely to cross a\nfitness barrier where the barrier is {\\em narrowest}, rather than where the\nbarrier is shallowest. \n\n"}

Our results are\nconsistent with the hypothesis that biological evolution manifests itself with\na modulation of basic correlations between shared peptides of short length,\npresent in protein sequences. Moreover, the simple procedure we propose\nreconfirms that it is possible, sampling entire proteomes, to average the\neffects of lateral gene transfer and infer reasonable phylogenies. \n\n"}

Using an experimental system of bacteriophage-mediated\ncompetition in bacterial populations and a deterministic model, we have shown\nin [Joo et al 2005] that the competitive advantage conferred by the phage\ndepends only on the relative phage pathology and is independent of the initial\nphage concentration and other phage and host parameters such as the\ninfection-causing contact rate, the spontaneous and infection-induced lysis\nrates, and the phage burst size. Here we investigate the effects of stochastic\nfluctuations on bacterial invasion facilitated by bacteriophage, and examine\nthe validity of the deterministic approach. We use both numerical and\nanalytical methods of stochastic processes to identify the source of noise and\nassess its magnitude. We show that the conclusions obtained from the\ndeterministic model are robust against stochastic fluctuations, yet deviations\nbecome prominently large when the phage are more pathological to the invading\nbacterial strain. \n\n"}

Newman claimed that a general network-based\nstochastic Susceptible-Infectious-Removed (SIR) epidemic model is isomorphic to\na bond percolation model, where the bonds are the edges of the contact network\nand the bond occupation probability is equal to the marginal probability of\ntransmission from an infected node to a susceptible neighbor. In this paper, we\nshow that this isomorphism is incorrect and define a semi-directed random\nnetwork we call the epidemic percolation network that is exactly isomorphic to\nthe SIR epidemic model in any finite population. In the limit of a large\npopulation, (i) the distribution of (self-limited) outbreak sizes is identical\nto the size distribution of (small) out-components, (ii) the epidemic threshold\ncorresponds to the phase transition where a giant strongly-connected component\nappears, (iii) the probability of a large epidemic is equal to the probability\nthat an initial infection occurs in the giant in-component, and (iv) the\nrelative final size of an epidemic is equal to the proportion of the network\ncontained in the giant out-component. For the SIR model considered by Newman,\nwe show that the epidemic percolation network predicts the same mean outbreak\nsize below the epidemic threshold, the same epidemic threshold, and the same\nfinal size of an epidemic as the bond percolation model. However, the bond\npercolation model fails to predict the correct outbreak size distribution and\nprobability of an epidemic when there is a nondegenerate infectious period\ndistribution. We confirm our findings by comparing predictions from percolation\nnetworks and bond percolation models to the results of simulations. In an\nappendix, we show that an isomorphism to an epidemic percolation network can be\ndefined for any time-homogeneous stochastic SIR model. \n\n"}

The model exhibits approximate 1/f noise in diversity and\npopulation-size fluctuations, and it generates a sequence of quasi-steady\ncommunities in the form of simple food webs. These communities are quite\nresilient toward the loss of one or a few species, which is reflected in\ndifferent power-law exponents for the durations of communities and the\nlifetimes of species. The exponent for the former is near -1, while the latter\nis close to -2. Statistical characteristics of the evolving communities,\nincluding degree (predator and prey) distributions and proportions of basal,\nintermediate, and top species, compare reasonably with data for real food webs. \n\n"}

First, we\nsummarise and adapt a deterministic approach, as valid for infinite\npopulations, which assumes continuous time and single crossover events. The\ncorresponding nonlinear system of differential equations permits a closed\nsolution, both in terms of the type frequencies and via linkage disequilibria\nof all orders. To include stochastic effects, we then consider the\ncorresponding finite-population model, the Moran model with single crossovers,\nand examine it both analytically and by means of simulations. Particular\nemphasis is on the connection with the deterministic solution. If there is only\nrecombination and every pair of recombined offspring replaces their pair of\nparents (i.e., there is no resampling), then the {\\em expected} type\nfrequencies in the finite population, of arbitrary size, equal the type\nfrequencies in the infinite population. If resampling is included, the\nstochastic process converges, in the infinite-population limit, to the\ndeterministic dynamics, which turns out to be a good approximation already for\npopulations of moderate size. \n\n"}

A coherent model for trees on (say) genera\nshould involve both a species-level model and a model for the classification\nscheme by which species are assigned to genera. We present a general framework\nfor such models, and describe three alternate classification schemes. Combining\nwith the species-level model of Aldous-Popovic (2005), one gets models for\nhigher-order trees, and we initiate analytic study of such models. In\nparticular we derive formulas for the lifetime of genera, for the distribution\nof number of species per genus, and for the offspring structure of the tree on\ngenera. \n\n"}
