The behavior of these volumes is strongly influenced by the\nregular or chaotic nature of the motion, the number of deviation vectors, their\nlinear (in)dependence and the spectrum of Lyapunov exponents. The different\ntime evolution of these volumes can be used to identify rapidly and efficiently\nthe nature of the dynamics, leading to the introduction of quantities that\nclearly distinguish between chaotic behavior and quasiperiodic motion on\n$N$-dimensional tori. More specifically we introduce the Generalized Alignment\nIndex of order $k$ (GALI$_k$) as the volume of a generalized parallelepiped,\nwhose edges are $k$ initially linearly independent unit deviation vectors from\nthe studied orbit whose magnitude is normalized to unity at every time step.\nThe GALI$_k$ is a generalization of the Smaller Alignment Index (SALI)\n(GALI$_2$ $\\propto$ SALI).

Firstly, we\nuse this approach to construct symplectic six-manifolds with c_1=0 which are\nnever Kahler; e.g., we produce such manifolds with b_1=0=b_3 and also with\nc_2.omega <0, answering questions posed by Smith-Thomas-Yau. Examples come from\nRiemannian geometry, via the Levi-Civita connection on Lambda^+. The underlying\nsix-manifold is then the twistor space and often the symplectic structure tames\nthe Eells-Salamon twistor almost complex structure.

The embedded contact homology (ECH) index associates\nan integer to each relative 2-dimensional homology class of surfaces whose\nboundary is the difference between two unions of Reeb orbits. This integer\ndetermines the relative grading on ECH; the ECH differential counts holomorphic\ncurves in the symplectization of Y whose relative homology classes have ECH\nindex 1. A known index inequality implies that such curves are (mostly)\nembedded and satisfy some additional constraints. In this paper we prove four\nnew results about the ECH index. First, we refine the relative grading on ECH\nto an absolute grading, which associates to each union of Reeb orbits a\nhomotopy class of oriented 2-plane fields on Y. Second, we extend the ECH index\ninequality to symplectic cobordisms between three-manifolds with Hamiltonian\nstructures, and simplify the proof. Third, we establish general inequalities on\nthe ECH index of unions and multiple covers of holomorphic curves in\ncobordisms. Finally, we define a new relative filtration on ECH, or any other\nkind of contact homology of a contact 3-manifold, which is similar to the ECH\nindex and related to the Euler characteristic of holomorphic curves.

They are a 2-category truncation of the 'derived\nmanifolds' of Spivak (see arXiv:0810.5174, arXiv:1212.1153). The category of\nmanifolds Man embeds in dMan as a full subcategory.

For brevity,\nthis survey concentrates mostly on d-manifolds without boundary. A longer and\nmore detailed summary of the book is given in arXiv:1208.4948.\n  Much of differential geometry extends very nicely to d-manifolds and\nd-orbifolds -- immersions, submersions, submanifolds, transverse fibre\nproducts, orientations, etc. Compact oriented d-manifolds and d-orbifolds have\nvirtual classes.\n  There are truncation functors to d-manifolds and d-orbifolds from essentially\nevery geometric structures on moduli spaces used in enumerative invariant\nproblems in differential geometry or complex algebraic geometry, including\nFredholm sections of Banach vector bundles over Banach manifolds, the\n\"Kuranishi spaces\" of Fukaya, Oh, Ohta and Ono and the \"polyfolds\" of Hofer,\nWysocki and Zehnder in symplectic geometry, and C-schemes with perfect\nobstruction theories in algebraic geometry.

To each three-component\nlink in Euclidean 3-space, we associate a geometrically natural generalized\nGauss map from the 3-torus to the 2-sphere, and show that the pairwise linking\nnumbers and Milnor triple linking number that classify the link up to link\nhomotopy correspond to the Pontryagin invariants that classify its generalized\nGauss map up to homotopy. This can be viewed as a natural extension of the\nfamiliar fact that the linking number of a two-component link in 3-space is the\ndegree of its associated Gauss map from the 2-torus to the 2-sphere. When the\npairwise linking numbers are all zero, we give an integral formula for the\ntriple linking number analogous to the Gauss integral for the pairwise linking\nnumbers, but patterned after J.H.C. Whitehead's integral formula for the Hopf\ninvariant. The integrand in this formula is geometrically natural in the sense\nthat it is invariant under orientation-preserving rigid motions of 3-space,\nwhile the integral itself can be viewed as the helicity of a related vector\nfield on the 3-torus.

For each integrable\nnonlinear evolution equation (NLEE) in the hierarchy, dual integrable\nstructures are characterized by the fact that the zero-curvature representation\nof the NLEE can be realized by two Hamiltonian formulations stemming from two\ndistinct choices of the configuration space, yielding two inequivalent Poisson\nstructures on the corresponding phase space and two distinct Hamiltonians. This\nis fundamentally different from the standard bi-Hamiltonian or generally\nmultitime structure. The first formulation chooses purely space-dependent\nfields as configuration space; it yields the standard Poisson structure for\nNLS. The other one is new: it chooses purely time-dependent fields as\nconfiguration space and yields a different Poisson structure at each level of\nthe hierarchy. The corresponding NLEE becomes a {\\it space} evolution equation.\nWe emphasize the role of the Lagrangian formulation as a unifying framework for\nderiving both Poisson structures, using ideas from covariant field theory. One\nof our main results is to show that the two matrices of the Lax pair satisfy\nthe same form of ultralocal Poisson algebra (up to a sign) characterized by an\n$r$-matrix structure, whereas traditionally only one of them is involved in the\nclassical $r$-matrix method.

After comparing possible compatibility conditions between the anchor\n$A\\to TM$ and the presymplectic structure on the base $M$, we choose the most\nnatural of them, given by a suitably chosen connection on $A$. We define a\nnotion of momentum section of $A^*$ and a condition for compatibility with the\nLie bracket. A Lie algebroid over a presymplectic manifold with compatible\nanchor and momentum section is then called hamiltonian. For an action Lie\nalgebroid, we retrieve the conditions of a hamiltonian action. The clean zero\nlocus of the momentum section of a hamiltonian Lie algebroid is a coisotropic\nsubmanifold.

In\naddition:\n  (a) the image of ( )^\\vee , resp. of ( )' , is the full subcategory of all\nQrUEAs, resp. of all QFAs;\n  (b) if p := Char(R/hR) = 0 , the restrictions of ( )^\\vee to the QFAs and of\n( )' to the QrUEAs yield equivalences inverse to each other;\n  (c) if p = 0 , starting from a QFA over a Poisson group G, resp. from a QrUEA\nover a Lie bialgebra g, the functor ( )^\\vee , resp. ( )' , gives a QrUEA,\nresp. a QFA, over the dual Lie bialgebra, resp. the dual Poisson group.\n  Several, far-reaching applications are developed in detail in [Ga2-4]. \n\n"}

The bracket does not satisfy\nthe Jacobi identity, but it does satisfy it for subalgebras which are isotropic\nunder a certain symmetric bilinear form with values in R^n. We ask what the\ncorresponding \"group-like\" object should be. The bracket may be obtained by\nlinearizing at a point the bracket on TM + T*M introduced by T.

We give explicit formulae for its ingredients and\ntest them numerically for periodic orbits in several Hamiltonian systems with\nmixed dynamics. We demonstrate how the Maslov indices and their ingredients can\nbe useful in the classification of periodic orbits in complicated bifurcation\nscenarios, for instance in a novel sequence of seven orbits born out of a\ntangent bifurcation in the H\\'enon-Heiles system. \n\n"}
{"id": "quant-ph/0107129", "contents": "Title: Algebraic geometric construction of a quantum stabilizer code Abstract: The stabilizer code is the most general algebraic construction of quantum\nerror-correcting codes proposed so far. A stabilizer code can be constructed\nfrom a self-orthogonal subspace of a symplectic space over a finite field. We\npropose a construction method of such a self-orthogonal space using an\nalgebraic curve. By using the proposed method we construct an asymptotically\ngood sequence of binary stabilizer codes. As a byproduct we improve the\nAshikhmin-Litsyn-Tsfasman bound of quantum codes. The main results in this\npaper can be understood without knowledge of quantum mechanics. \n\n"}
