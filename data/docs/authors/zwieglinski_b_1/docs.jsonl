The LEM is a macroscopic hole\nelectron multiplier built with standard PCB techniques: drifting electrons are\nextracted from the liquid to the vapour phase and driven into the holes of the\nLEM where the multiplication occurs.

Such possibility is severely restricted by the constraints on\nanomalous isotopes of light elements that form positively charged heavy species\nwith ordinary electrons. The trouble is avoided, if stable particles $X^{--}$\nwith charge -2 are in excess over their antiparticles (with charge +2) and\nthere are no stable particles with charges +1 and -1. Then primordial helium,\nformed in Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, captures all $X^{--}$ in neutral \"atoms\" of\nO-helium (OHe). Schrodinger equation for system of nucleus and OHe is\nconsidered and reduced to an equation of relative motion in a spherically\nsymmetrical potential, formed by the Yukawa tail of nuclear scalar isoscalar\nattraction potential, acting on He beyond the nucleus, and dipole Coulomb\nrepulsion between the nucleus and OHe at small distances between nuclear\nsurfaces of He and nucleus.

Partons losing enough energy may not even\nmake it out of the medium as identifiable jets (although the momentum will be\nshared among whatever particles are emitted). \"Full\" jet reconstruction\nattempts to determine the partonic energy loss as well as possible changes in\njet shape.

A variety of techniques using high-$p_t$ particles,\nassumed to be leading particles from jet fragmentation, look for disappearance\nof jets and attenuation of jets relative to the reaction plane, as well as\nmedium modifications such as Mach cones.

We address this issue in a lattice QCD with\nthe use of a dimensional reduction formula of the fermion determinant.\n  We investigate spectral properties of a reduced matrix of the reduction\nformula. Lattice simulations with different lattice sizes show that the\neigenvalues of the reduced matrix follow a scaling law for the temporal size\n$N_t$. The properties of the fermion determinant are examined using the\nreduction formula. We find that as a consequence of the $N_t$ scaling law, the\nfermion determinant becomes insensitive to $\\mu$ as $T$ decreases, and\n$\\mu$-independent at T=0 for $\\mu<m_\\pi/2$.\n  The $N_t$ scaling law provides two types of the low temperature limit of the\nfermion determinant: (i) for low density and (ii) for high-density. The fermion\ndeterminant becomes real and the theory is free from the sign problem in both\ncases. In case of (ii), QCD approaches to a theory, where quarks interact only\nin spatial directions, and gluons interact via the ordinary Yang-Mills action.\nThe partition function becomes exactly $Z_3$ invariant even in the presence of\ndynamical quarks because of the absence of the temporal interaction of quarks.\n  The reduction formula is also applied to the canonical formalism and Lee-Yang\nzero theorem. We find characteristic temperature dependences of the canonical\ndistribution and of Lee-Yang zero trajectory. Using an assumption on the\ncanonical partition function, we discuss physical meaning of those temperature\ndependences and show that the change of the canonical distribution and Lee-Yang\nzero trajectory are related to the existence/absence of $\\mu$-induced phase\ntransitions. \n\n"}

In this paper we extract a novel observable, the\ntransparency ratio, Tp(A)/T_p(12C), for knockout of high-missing-momentum\nprotons from the breakup of short range correlated pairs (2N-SRC) in Al, Fe and\nPb nuclei relative to C. The ratios were measured at momentum transfer Q^2 >\n1.5 (GeV/c)^2 and x_B > 1.2 where the reaction is expected to be dominated by\nelectron scattering from 2N-SRC. The transparency ratios of the knocked-out\nprotons coming from 2N-SRC breakup are 20 - 30% lower than those of previous\nresults for low missing momentum. They agree with Glauber calculations and\nagree with renormalization of the previously published transparencies as\nproposed by recent theoretical investigations.

In this regime, the\neikonal approximation is valid, so is employed to calculate the cross-section\nfor the reaction. Due to the high-energy nature of the FSIs, the maxima of the\nrescatterings are located at nearly transverse directions of the fast hadrons.\nThis results in two peaks in the angular distribution of the spectator nucleon,\neach corresponding to either the $V$-$N$ or the $p$-$n$ rescattering.

This approach yields transition operators that are\nconsistent with the Hamiltonian, and the power counting of the effective theory\nprovides us with theoretical uncertainty estimates. We successfully test the\neffective theory in homonuclear molecules that exhibit a large separation of\nscales.

For transitional nuclei, next-to-leading order calculations\nand the high-precision data are consistent within the theoretical uncertainty\nestimates.

Hydrodynamics requires that the\nenergy-momentum tensor $T^{\\mu\\nu}$ and four-currents $j^{\\mu}$ do not deviate\nconsiderably from the equilibrium ideal-fluid form, but the ones constructed\nfrom transport do not necessarily possess this property. In this work we\ninvestigate the space-time picture of $T^{\\mu\\nu}$ deviations from equilibrium\nin Au+Au collisions using a coarse-grained transport approach. The collision\nenergy is varied in the range $E_{lab} = 5-160A$ GeV. The sensitivity of\n$T^{\\mu\\nu}$ deviations from equilibrium to collision centrality, and other\nparameters such as the switching criterion, the amount of statistics used to\nconstruct the initial state, and the smearing parameter $\\sigma$ is\ninvestigated. For low statistics deviations of $T^{\\mu\\nu}$ from equilibrium\nare large and dominated by the effect of finite sampling.

For all considered energies and centralities the pressure anisotropy\nexhibits a similar feature: there is a narrow interval of time, when it rapidly\ndrops in a considerable volume.

The isotropization times are larger than times typically used for\ninitializing hydrodynamics. \n\n"}

Using a modified version of the\nevent generator PYTHIA, in conjunction with a nuclear Glauber Monte-Carlo event\ngenerator, we demonstrate how events with a hard jet may be simulated, in such\na way that the parton distribution function of the projectile nucleon is frozen\nduring its interaction with the extended nucleus. Using our hybrid Monte-Carlo\nevent generator, we demonstrate that the enhancement in $R_{pA}$ seen in\nperipheral events at RHIC and at LHC, as well as the depletion in central or\nsemi-central events, is mainly due to \"mis-binning\" of central and semi-central\nevents with a jet, as peripheral events. This occurs due to the reduction of\nsoft particle production caused by a depletion of energy available in a nucleon\n(of the deuteron in the case of d-Au collisions), after the production of a\nhard jet. This represents a form of \"color transparency\" of the projectile\nnucleon, which has fluctuated to a state with fewer and harder partons, in\nevents which lead to jet production.

Its extension to the\nmulti-reference level allows for restoring symmetries and, in turn, for\ncalculating transition rates.\n  [Purpose] We propose a new no-core-configuration-interaction (NCCI) model\ntreating properly isospin and rotational symmetries. The model is applicable to\nany nucleus irrespective of its mass and neutron- and proton-number parity. It\nproperly includes polarization effects caused by an interplay between the long-\nand short-range forces acting in the atomic nucleus.\n  [Methods] The method is based on solving the Hill-Wheeler-Griffin equation\nwithin a model space built of linearly-dependent states having good angular\nmomentum and properly treated isobaric spin. The states are generated by means\nof the isospin and angular-momentum projection applied to a set of low-lying\n(multi)particle-(multi)hole deformed Slater determinants calculated using the\nself-consistent Skyrme-Hartree-Fock approach.\n  [Results] The theory is applied to calculate energy spectra in N~Z nuclei\nthat are relevant from the point of view of a study of superallowed Fermi\nbeta-decays. In particular, a new set of the isospin-symmetry-breaking\ncorrections to these decays is given.\n  [Conclusions] It is demonstrated that the NCCI model is capable to capture\nmain features of low-lying energy spectra in light and medium-mass nuclei using\nrelatively small model space and without any local readjustment of its\nlow-energy coupling constants. Its flexibility and a range of applicability\nmakes it an interesting alternative to the conventional nuclear shell model. \n\n"}

The front-end unit is a 30-channel circuit board that\nholds five PSEC4 ASICs, a clock jitter cleaner, and a control FPGA. The analog\nbandwidth of the front-end signal path is 1.5 GHz. Each channel has an on-chip\nthreshold-level discriminator that is monitored in the FPGA, from which a\nflexible on-board trigger decision can be formed. To instrument larger channel\ncounts, a `back-end' 6U VME32 control card has been designed. Called the\n'Central Card', it incorporates an Altera Arria-V FPGA that manages up to 8\nfront-end cards using one or two CAT5 network cables per board, which transmits\nthe clock and communicates data packets over a custom serial protocol. Data can\nbe read from the Central Card via USB, Ethernet, or dual SFP links, in addition\nto the VME interface. The Central Card can be configured as either Master or\nSlave, allowing one Master to receive data from up to 8 Slaves, with each Slave\nmanaging 8 30-channel front-end cards, allowing a single VME crate to control\nup to 1920 channels of the PSEC4 chip. \n\n"}

The kink theory correctly reproduces a first order phase transition\nto lightly bound nuclear matter. As the density is further increased the kink\nsplits into a pair of half-kink constituents, providing a concrete realization\nof the previously suggested dyonic salt phase, where the bulk soliton splits\ninto constituents at high density. The kink model also captures the phenomenon\nof baryonic popcorn, in which a first order phase transition generates an\nadditional soliton layer in the holographic direction. We find that this\npopcorn transition takes place at a density below the dyonic salt phase, making\nthe latter energetically unfavourable. However, the kink model predicts only\none pop, rather than the sequence of pops suggested by previous approximations.\nIn the kink model the two layers produced by the single pop form the surface of\na soliton bag that increases in size as the baryon chemical potential is\nincreased. The interior of the bag is filled with abelian electric potential\nand the instanton charge density is localized on the surface of the bag.

The small-angle capability of the new Super High Momentum Spectrometer\n(SHMS) in Hall C, coupled with its high momentum reach - up to the anticipated\n11-GeV beam energy in Hall C - and coincidence capability with the\nwell-understood High Momentum Spectrometer, will allow for probes of such\nhadron structure involving strangeness down to the smallest distance scales to\ndate. To cleanly select the kaons, a threshold aerogel Cerenkov detector has\nbeen constructed for the SHMS. The detector consists of an aerogel tray\nfollowed by a diffusion box. Four trays for aerogel of nominal refractive\nindices of n=1.030, 1.020, 1.015 and 1.011 were constructed. The tray\ncombination will allow for identification of kaons from 1 GeV/c up to 7.2\nGeV/c, reaching 10^-2 proton and 10^-3 pion rejection, with kaon detection\nefficiency better than 95%.

Abstract: The $\\Xi$ baryons are expected to be naturally narrower as compared to their\nnonstrange and strange counterparts since they have only one light quark and,\nthus, their decay involves producing either a light meson and doubly strange\nbaryon or both meson and baryon with strangeness which involves, relatively,\nmore energy. In fact, some $\\Xi$'s have full widths of the order of even 10-20\nMeV when, in principle, they have a large phase space to decay to some open\nchannels. Such is the case of $\\Xi (1690)$, for which the width has been found\nto be of the order of 10 MeV in the latest {\\it BABAR} and BELLE data. In this\nmanuscript we study why some $\\Xi$'s are so narrow. Based on a coupled channel\ncalculation of the pseudoscalar meson-baryon and vector meson-baryon systems\nwith chiral and hidden local symmetry Lagrangians, we find that the answer lies\nin the intricate hadron dynamics.

We propose a\nnew experiment, ForwArd Search ExpeRiment, or FASER, which would be placed\ndownstream of the ATLAS or CMS interaction point (IP) in the very forward\nregion and operated concurrently there. Two representative on-axis locations\nare studied: a far location, $400~\\text{m}$ from the IP and just off the beam\ntunnel, and a near location, just $150~\\text{m}$ from the IP and right behind\nthe TAN neutral particle absorber. For each location, we examine leading\nneutrino- and beam-induced backgrounds.

The first phase will focus\non the graphene technology for a tritium target and the demonstration of TES\nmicrocalorimetry with an energy resolution of better than 0.05 eV for low\nenergy electrons. These technologies will be evaluated using the PTOLEMY\nprototype, proposed for underground installation, using precision HV controls\nto step down the kinematic energy of endpoint electrons to match the\ncalorimeter dynamic range and rate capabilities.

Abstract: A future core-collapse supernova in our Galaxy will be detected by several\nneutrino detectors around the world. The neutrinos escape from the supernova\ncore over several seconds from the time of collapse, unlike the electromagnetic\nradiation, emitted from the envelope, which is delayed by a time of order\nhours. In addition, the electromagnetic radiation can be obscured by dust in\nthe intervening interstellar space. The question therefore arises whether a\nsupernova can be located by its neutrinos alone. The early warning of a\nsupernova and its location might allow greatly improved astronomical\nobservations. The theme of the present work is a careful and realistic\nassessment of this question, taking into account the statistical significance\nof the various neutrino signals. Not surprisingly, neutrino-electron forward\nscattering leads to a good determination of the supernova direction, even in\nthe presence of the large and nearly isotropic background from other reactions.\nEven with the most pessimistic background assumptions, SuperKamiokande (SK) and\nthe Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) can restrict the supernova direction to\nbe within circles of radius $5^\\circ$ and $20^\\circ$, respectively.

Such an effect, if real, would\ndestabilize a neutron star. To address this issue we have studied the related\nproblem of a massless neutrino field in the presence of an external, static\nelectroweak potential of finite range. To be precise, we have computed to one\nloop the exact vacuum energy for the case of a spherical square well potential\nof depth alpha and radius R. For small wells, the vacuum energy is reliably\ndetermined by a perturbative expansion in the external potential. For large\nwells, however, the perturbative expansion breaks down.

We show that the distribution of recoil\nnucleons depends strongly on the angle between the momentum of the recoil\nnucleon and the polarization vector of the target (or outgoing nucleon). This\ndependence is especially sensitive to the spin flip skewed parton distribution\n(SPD) $\\widetilde E$.

The vector meson mass\ndrops significantly in the medium due to the effects of the Dirac sea. In the\nvariational approach adopted in the present paper, these effects are taken into\naccount through a realignment of the ground state with baryon condensates. Such\na realignment of the ground state becomes equivalent to summing of the baryonic\ntadpole diagrams in the relativistic Hartree approximation (RHA).

Unfortunately, AM noise is taken in through\nthe power-to-dc-offset conversion mechanism that results from the mixer\nasymmetry.

In addition, the trick of setting\nthe mixer at a sweet point -- off the quadrature condition -- where the\nsensitivity to AM nulls, works only with microwave mixers.
