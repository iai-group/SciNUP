This polynomial closure is typical for 2nd order\nsuperintegrable systems in 2D and for 2nd order systems in 3D with\nnondegenerate (4-parameter) potentials.

The nonrelativistic Hamiltonian for weak, time-independent\nfields interacting with quantum matter is then extended to time-dependent\nfields, and applied to problem of the interaction of radiation with\nmacroscopically coherent quantum systems, including the problem of\ngravitational radiation interacting with superconductors. But first we examine\nthe interaction of EM radiation with superconductors in a parametric oscillator\nconsisting of a superconducting wire placed at the center of a high Q\nsuperconducting cavity driven by pump microwaves. We find that the threshold\nfor parametric oscillation for EM microwave generation is much lower for the\nseparated configuration than the unseparated one, which then leads to an\nobservable dynamical Casimir effect. We speculate that a separated parametric\noscillator for generating coherent GR microwaves could also be built. \n\n"}

An important example is the heralded production of\nhigh-purity single-photon states, typically based on some nonlinear optical\ninteraction. In contrast, on-demand single-photon sources were also reported,\nexploiting the quantized level structure of matter systems.

We show how the amount of lost particles can be minimized by adjusting\nthe number of round trips through the setup, and we explicitly calculate the\namount of lost particles in measurements which either aim at distinguishing two\ntransparencies or at measuring an unknown transparency precisely. We also\ndiscuss the effect of the sample causing phase shifts in interaction-free\nmeasurements. Comparing the resulting loss of probe particles with a classical\nmeasurement of transparency, we find that interaction-free measurements only\nprovide a benefit in two cases: first, if two semitransparent samples with a\nhigh contrast are to be distinguished, interaction-free measurements lose less\nparticles than classical measurements by a factor that increases with the\ncontrast. This implies that interaction-free measurements with zero loss are\npossible if one of the samples is perfectly transparent. A second case where\ninteraction-free measurements outperform classical measurements is if three\nconditions are met: the particle source exhibits Poissonian number statistics,\nthe number of lost particles cannot be measured, and the transparency is larger\nthan approximately 1/2. In all other cases, interaction-free measurements lose\nas many probe particles as classical measurements or more. \n\n"}

The uncertainty relation in the context of information theory,\nwhich is based on Fourier analysis, provides a criterion to distinguish\nShannon-Nyquist sampling from compressed sensing. A new signal recovery\nformula, which is analogous to Donoho-Stark formula, is given using the idea of\nShannon-Nyquist sampling; in this formulation, the smearing of information\nbelow the uncertainty limit as well as the recovery of information with\nspecified bandwidth take place.

Despite\nof several attempts to resolve this issue by putting forward specific models,\nthese are far from capturing realistically the transitions that a quantum\nmachine is expected to perform. In this work, we adopt a novel strategy by\nconsidering arbitrary kinds of systems that one can attach to a quantum thermal\nmachine and seeking for work quantifiers. These are functions that measure the\nvalue of a transition and generalise the concept of work beyond the model of a\nlifted weight.

In this paper, we further study this problem and exhibit\nnovel results in both multi-copy and asymptotic settings. In the multi-copy\nregime, we observe that the maximal Schmidt rank is strictly\nsuper-multiplicative, i.e. the maximal Schmidt rank of the tensor product of\ntwo tripartite pure states can be strictly larger than the product of their\nmaximal Schmidt ranks. We then provide a full characterization of those\ntripartite states whose maximal Schmidt rank is strictly super-multiplicative\nwhen taking tensor product with itself. In the asymptotic setting, we focus on\ndetermining the tripartite-to-bipartite SLOCC entanglement transformation rate,\nwhich turns out to be equivalent to computing the asymptotic maximal Schmidt\nrank of the tripartite state, defined as the regularization of its maximal\nSchmidt rank.

The entanglement operations in\na pattern can be shown by a graph which together with the set of its input and\noutput qubits is called the geometry of the pattern. Since a one-way quantum\ncomputation pattern is based on quantum measurements, which are fundamentally\nnondeterministic evolutions, there must be conditions over geometries to\nguarantee determinism. Causal flow is a sufficient and generalized flow (gflow)\nis a necessary and sufficient condition over geometries to identify a\ndependency structure for the measurement sequences in order to achieve\ndeterminism. Previously, three optimization methods have been proposed to\nsimplify 1WQC patterns which are called standardization, signal shifting and\nPauli simplification. These optimizations can be performed using measurement\ncalculus formalism by rewriting rules. However, maintaining and searching these\nrules in the library can be complicated with respect to implementation.\nMoreover, serial execution of these rules is time consuming due to executing\nmany ineffective commutation rules. To overcome this problem, in this paper, a\nnew scheme is proposed to perform optimization techniques on patterns with flow\nor gflow only based on their geometries instead of using rewriting rules.\nFurthermore, the proposed scheme obtains the maximally delayed gflow order for\ngeometries with flow. It is shown that the time complexity of the proposed\napproach is improved over the previous ones. \n\n"}

There have been numerous\nproposals for performing gates faster than this natural \"speed limit\" of the\ntrap. We implement the method of Steane et al., which uses tailored laser\npulses: these are shaped on 10 ns timescales to drive the ions' motion along\ntrajectories designed such that the gate operation is insensitive to optical\nphase fluctuations. This permits fast (MHz-rate) quantum logic which is robust\nto this important source of experimental error. We demonstrate entanglement\ngeneration for gate times as short as 480ns; this is less than a single\noscillation period of an ion in the trap, and 8 orders of magnitude shorter\nthan the memory coherence time measured in similar calcium-43 hyperfine qubits.\nThe method's power is most evident at intermediate timescales, where it yields\na gate error more than ten times lower than conventional techniques; for\nexample, we achieve a 1.6 us gate with fidelity 99.8%.

We provide strong evidence that the threshold error rate of the\nsurface code tracks the hashing bound exactly for all biases, and show how to\nexploit these features to achieve significant improvement in logical failure\nrate.
