When black hole spins are\nmisaligned, the constant radius orbits are not circles but rather lie on the\nsurface of a sphere and have acquired the name \"spherical orbits\". The\nspherical orbits are significant as they energetically frame the distribution\nof all orbits.

A homoclinic trajectory is an infinite whirl limit of the\nzoom-whirl spectrum and has a further significance as the separatrix between\ninspiral and plunge for eccentric orbits.

We confirm that this\nsimple method provides the same third- and fourth- order actions at leading\norder in slow-roll and in the small sound speed limit as those obtained by the\nusual ADM formalism. As an application, we compute the leading order connected\nfour-point function of the primordial curvature perturbation coming from the\nintrinsic fourth-order contact interaction in the multi-field DBI-inflation\nmodel. At the third order, the interaction Hamiltonian arises purely by the\nboost from the second-order action in the rest frame of the brane. The boost\nacts on the adiabatic and entropy modes in the same way thus there exists a\nsymmetry between the adiabatic and entropy modes. But at fourth order this\nsymmetry is broken due to the intrinsic fourth-order action in the rest frame\nand the difference between the Lagrangian and the interaction Hamiltonian.\nTherefore, contrary to the three-point function, the momentum dependence of the\npurely adiabatic component and the components including the entropic\ncontributions are different in the four-point function.

Abstract: A review is given of the theory of non-inertial frames (with the associated\ninertial effects and the study of the non-relativistic limit) in Minkowski\nspace-time, of parametrized Minkowski theories and of the rest-frame instant\nform of dynamics for isolated systems admitting a Lagrangian description. The\nrelevance and gauge equivalence of the clock synchronization conventions for\nthe identification of the instantaneous 3-spaces (Euclidean only in inertial\nframes) are described. Then this formalism is applied to tetrad gravity in\nglobally hyperbolic, asymptotically Minkowskian space-times without\nsuper-translations, where the equivalence principle implies the absence of\nglobal inertial frames. The recently discovered York canonical basis,\ndiagonalizing the York-Lichnerowicz approach, allows to identify the gauge\nvariables (inertial effects in general relativity) and the tidal ones (the\ngravitational waves of the linearized theory) and to clarify the meaning of the\nHamilton equations. The role of the gauge variable ${}^3K$, the trace of the\nextrinsic curvature of the non-Euclidean 3-space (the York time not existing in\nNewton theory), as a source of inertial effects is emphasized. After the\npresentation of preliminary results on the linearization of tetrad gravity in\nthe family of non-harmonic 3-orthogonal gauges with a free value of ${}^3K$, we\ndefine post-Minkowskian gravitational waves (without post-Newtonian\napproximations on the matter sources) propagating in a non-Euclidean 3-space,\nemphasizing the non-graviton-like aspects of gravity.

In this paper, the last of\nthe series, we present more comparisons of our theoretical results to\nobservations and also give new predictions for further comparisons. Our theory\nprovides the right building blocks for the rectangular-like bar outline and for\nansae.

The point lens (source) approximation alone gives an\nunder (over)estimation of the astrometric signal when the size of the lens and\nsource are not negligible.

Uncertainties in the\n  predictions of the hadronic component Abstract: The Galactic gamma-ray diffuse emission is currently observed in the GeV-TeV\nenergy range with unprecedented accuracy by the Fermi satellite. Understanding\nthis component is crucial as it provides a background to many different signals\nsuch as extragalactic sources or annihilating dark matter. It is timely to\nreinvestigate how it is calculated and to assess the various uncertainties\nwhich are likely to affect the accuracy of the predictions. The Galactic\ngamma-ray diffuse emission is mostly produced above a few GeV by the\ninteractions of cosmic ray primaries impinging on the interstellar material.\nThe theoretical error on that component is derived by exploring various\npotential sources of uncertainty. Particular attention is paid to cosmic ray\npropagation. Nuclear cross sections, the proton and helium fluxes at the Earth,\nthe Galactic radial profile of supernova remnants and the hydrogen distribution\ncan also severely affect the signal. The propagation of cosmic ray species\nthroughout the Galaxy is described in the framework of a semi-analytic two-zone\ndiffusion/convection model. This allows to convert the constraints set by the\nboron-to-carbon data into a theoretical uncertainty on the diffuse emission.\nNew deconvolutions of the HI and CO sky maps are also used to get the hydrogen\ndistribution within the Galaxy. The thickness of the cosmic ray diffusive halo\nis found to have a significant effect on the Galactic gamma-ray diffuse\nemission while the interplay between diffusion and convection has little\ninfluence on the signal. The uncertainties related to nuclear cross sections\nand to the primary cosmic ray fluxes at the Earth are significant. The radial\ndistribution of supernova remnants along the Galactic plane turns out to be a\nkey ingredient. As expected, the predictions are extremely sensitive to the\nspatial distribution of hydrogen within the Milky Way. \n\n"}

Four of the new dwarfs appear as\nwell-defined spatial over-densities of stars lying on the expected locus of\nmetal-poor red giant branch stars at the distance of M31.

Both phenomena will imprint signatures about the stellar structure in the\nemitted gravitational radiation.

Lower energy\nextra-galactic cosmic rays (~10^18-10^19 eV) can only travel a linear distance\nsmaller than ~Gpc in a Hubble time due to the diffusion if the extra-galactic\nmagnetic fields are as strong as nano Gauss. These prevent us from directly\nobserving most of the UHECRs in the universe, and thus the observed UHECR\nintensity reflects only the emissivity in the nearby universe within hundreds\nof Mpc. However, UHECRs in the distant universe, through interactions with the\ncosmic background photons, produce UHE electrons and gamma-rays that in turn\ninitiate electromagnetic cascades on cosmic background photons. This secondary\ncascade radiation forms part of the extragalactic diffuse GeV-TeV gamma-ray\nradiation and, unlike the original UHECRs, is observable. Motivated by new\nmeasurements of extragalactic diffuse gamma-ray background radiation by\nFermi/LAT, we obtained upper limits placed on the UHECR emissivity in the\ndistant universe by requiring that the cascade radiation they produce not\nexceed the observed levels. By comparison with the gamma-ray emissivity of\ncandidate UHECR sources (such as GRBs and AGNs) at high-redshifts, we find that\nthe obtained upper limit for a flat proton spectrum is ~10^1.5 times larger\nthan the gamma-ray emissivity in GRBs and ~10 times smaller than the gamma-ray\nemissivity in BL Lac objects.

The SNR has a bipolar structure\nand the point source is located near a faint bridge of emission joining the two\nlobes of emission. The point source was also detected in follow-up higher\nfrequency(1170 MHz) observations. The spectral index for the point source\nobtained from the GMRT observations is alpha = -2.1. The steep spectrum, as\nwell as the location of the point source near the centre of the SNR establish\nthe fact that it is indeed the pulsar J2022+3842 associated with this SNR.\nConsistent with this, subsequent analysis of archival Chandra X-ray data shows\na point source coincident with the radio point source, as well as diffuse\nextended X-ray emission surrounding the unresolved source. However, no pulsed\nemission was detected despite deep searches at both 610 MHz and 1160 MHz\nalthough pulsed emission has been seen at 2 GHz with the GBT. It appears that\nthe most likely reason for not detecting the pulsed signal at the GMRT is\ntemporal broadening: for the estimated DM towards this SNR, the pulse\nbroadening time could be as large as tens of milliseconds. The diffuse X-ray\nemission is elongated along the same direction as the bipolar structure seen in\nthe radio. We interpret the radio lobes as having been formed from an\nequatorial wind. Although direct detection of pulsed signal has not been\npossible, we show convincingly that sensitive, high-resolution, radio imaging\nat multiple frequencies is a useful method to search for pulsar candidates. \n\n"}

The possibility of a single SMBHB being tracked first by PTA, through\ninspiral, and later by SLI, up to merger and ring down, has been previously\nsuggested. Although the bounding parameters are drawn by the current PTA or the\nupcoming Square Kilometer Array (SKA), and by the New Gravitational Observatory\n(NGO), derived from the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), this paper\nalso addresses sequential detection beyond specific project constraints. We\nconsider PTA-SKA, which is sensitive from 10^(-9) to p x 10^(-7) Hz (p=4, 8),\nand SLI, which operates from s x 10^(-5) up to 1 Hz (s = 1, 3). A SMBHB in the\nrange 2x 10^(8) - 2 x 10^(9) solar masses (the masses are normalised to a (1+z)\nfactor, the red shift lying between z = 0.2 and z=1.5) moves from the PTA-SKA\nto the SLI band over a period ranging from two months to fifty years. By\ncombining three Super Massive Black Hole (SMBH)-host relations with three\naccretion prescriptions, nine astrophysical scenarios are formed. They are then\nrelated to three levels of pulsar timing residuals (50, 5, 1 ns), generating\ntwenty-seven cases. For residuals of 1 ns, sequential detection probability\nwill never be better than 4.7 x 10^(-4) y^(-2) or 3.3 x 10^(-6) y^(-2) (per\nyear to merger and per year of survey), according to the best and worst\nastrophysical scenarios, respectively; put differently this means one\nsequential detection every 46 or 550 years for an equivalent maximum time to\nmerger and duration of the survey. The chances of sequential detection are\nfurther reduced by increasing values of the s parameter (they vanish for s =\n10) and of the SLI noise, and by decreasing values of the remnant spin.

The canonical thermally\naveraged cross section for a generic WIMP is usually stated as 3*10^-26\ncm^3s^-1, with unspecified uncertainty, and taken to be independent of WIMP\nmass. Recent searches for annihilation products of DM annihilation have just\nreached the sensitivity to exclude this canonical cross section for 100%\nbranching ratio to certain final states and small WIMP masses. The ultimate\ngoal is to probe all kinematically allowed final states as a function of mass\nand, if all states are adequately excluded, set a lower limit to the WIMP mass.\nProbing the low-mass region is further motivated due to recent hints for a\nlight WIMP in direct and indirect searches. We revisit the thermal relic\nabundance calculation for a generic WIMP and show that the required cross\nsection can be calculated precisely.

The long-duration gravitational-waveforms emitted\nby such systems encode the structure of the strong field region of the massive\nblack hole, in which the inspiral occurs. The detection and analysis of EMRIs\nwill therefore allow us to study the geometry of massive black holes and\ndetermine whether their nature is as predicted by General Relativity and even\nto test whether General Relativity is the correct theory to describe the\ndynamics of these systems. To achieve this, EMRI modeling in alternative\ntheories of gravity is required to describe the generation of gravitational\nwaves. In this paper, we explore to what extent EMRI observations with LISA or\neLISA/NGO might be able to distinguish between General Relativity and a\nparticular modification of it, known as Dynamical Chern-Simons Modified\nGravity. Our analysis is based on a parameter estimation study that uses\napproximate gravitational waveforms obtained via a radiative-adiabatic method\nand is restricted to a five-dimensional subspace of the EMRI configuration\nspace.

However, one might wonder whether the corresponding incomplete\ngeodesics could still be complete in a possible non-globally hyperbolic\nextension of spacetime.

Supposing that the Universe contains also the\ncosmological constant and a perfect fluid with a negative constant equation of\nstate (EoS) parameter $\\omega$ (e.g., quintessence, phantom or frustrated\nnetwork of topological defects), we investigate scalar perturbations of the FRW\nmetrics due to inhomogeneities.

In\nprinciple, all of these quantities depend on the neutron star's internal\nstructure, and thus, on unknown nuclear physics at supra-nuclear energy\ndensities.

Three important\nconsequences derive from these I-Love-Q relations. On an observational\nastrophysics front, the measurement of a single member of the I-Love-Q trio\nwould automatically provide information about the other two, even when the\nlatter may not be observationally accessible.

Instead, this torque-limited accretion model yields black\nholes and galaxies evolving on average along the observed scaling relations by\nrelying only on a fixed, 5% mass retention rate onto the black hole from the\nradius at which the accretion flow is fed.

Einstein's theory has been greatly constrained\nin the quasi-linear, quasi-stationary regime, where gravity is weak and\nvelocities are small. Gravitational waves will allow us to probe a\ncomplimentary, yet previously unexplored regime: the non-linear and dynamical\nstrong-field regime.

This review begins with\nthe theoretical basis and the predicted gravitational wave observables of\nmodified gravity theories.

These models are used for\nsimulations, but more importantly, they will be used for parameter estimation\npurposes during flight operations. One of the tasks of the data analysis team\nis to identify the physical effects that contribute significantly to the\nproperties of the instrument noise. A way of approaching this problem is to\nrecover the essential parameters of a LTP model fitting the data. Thus, we want\nto define the simplest model that efficiently explains the observations. To do\nso, adopting a Bayesian framework, one has to estimate the so-called Bayes\nFactor between two competing models. In our analysis, we use three main\ndifferent methods to estimate it: The Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo\nmethod, the Schwarz criterion, and the Laplace approximation. They are applied\nto simulated LPF experiments where the most probable LTP model that explains\nthe observations is recovered. The same type of analysis presented in this\npaper is expected to be followed during flight operations.

In the search for short\nduration signals, such as coalescing compact binary inspirals or \"burst\"\nevents, noise transients can be problematic.

As an added benefit, this also removes the (as of yet unobserved)\nmassless Goldstino associated to global supersymmetry breaking from the\nparticle spectrum. In this review we detail the pertinent properties and\noutline previously hidden details of the various steps required in this context\nin order to make contact with current inflationary phenomenology. The class of\nmodels of SUGRA we use to exemplify our approach are minimal four-dimensional\nN=1 supergravity and conformal extensions thereof (with broken conformal\nsymmetry).

When the\nBF bound is satisfied, it is already known that there can exist instantons with\na non-zero probability, though fine-tunings of the potential are required.

To date, LArTPC light collection systems\nhave employed tetraphenyl butadiene (TPB) coatings on photomultiplier tubes\n(PMTs) or plates placed in front of the PMTs. Recently, a new approach using\nTPB-coated light guides was proposed. In this paper, we report on light guides\nwith improved attenuation lengths above 100 cm when measured in air. This is an\nimportant step in the development of meter-scale light guides for future\nLArTPCs. Improvements come from using a new acrylic-based coating,\ndiamond-polished cast UV transmitting acrylic bars, and a hand-dipping\ntechnique to coat the bars. We discuss a model for connecting bar response in\nair to response in liquid argon and compare this to data taken in liquid argon.\nThe good agreement between the prediction of the model and the measured\nresponse in liquid argon demonstrates that characterization in air is\nsufficient for quality control of bar production. This model can be used in\nsimulations of light guides for future experiments. \n\n"}

Our goal is to\ncharacterize in detail the source gamma-ray emission, together with the\nradio-to-X-ray emission, during the non-flaring (low) activity, which is less\noften studied than the occasional flaring (high) activity. We organized a\nmultiwavelength (MW) campaign on Mrk 501 between March and May 2008.

Mrk 501 was found to be in a low state of\nactivity during the campaign, with a VHE flux in the range of 10%-20% of the\nCrab nebula flux. Nevertheless, significant flux variations were detected with\nvarious instruments, with a trend of increasing variability with energy.

As an initial example of such a study,\nthe recipe in (Green & Wald, 2012) for going between N-body results and a\nperturbed FLRW metric in the Newtonian gauge is used to study light propagation\nthrough quasi-spherical Szekeres models. The study is conducted by deriving a\nset of ODEs giving an expression for the angular diameter distance in the\nNewtonian gauge metric. The accuracy of the results obtained from the ODEs is\nestimated by using the ODEs to determine the distance-redshift relation in mock\nN-body data based on quasi-spherical Szekeres models.

Radiometer analysis can\nbe performed in different bases, e.g., isotropic, pixel or spherical harmonic.\nEach of these analyses possesses a common temporal symmetry which we exploit\nhere to fold the whole dataset for every detector pair, typically a few hundred\nto a thousand days of data, to only one sidereal day, without any compromise in\nprecision. We develop the algebra and a software pipeline needed to fold data,\naccounting for the effect of overlapping windows and non-stationary noise. We\nimplement this on LIGO's fifth science run data and validate it by performing a\nstandard anisotropic SGWB search on both folded and unfolded data. Folded data\nnot only leads to orders of magnitude reduction in computation cost, but it\nresults in a conveniently small data volume of few gigabytes, making it\npossible to perform an actual analysis on a personal computer, as well as easy\nmovement of data.

We find a clear connection between the\ngamma-ray and radio emission, such that every period of gamma-ray activity is\naccompanied by the flaring of the mm-VLBI core and subsequent ejection of a new\nsuperluminal component. However, not all ejections of components are associated\nwith gamma-ray events detectable by Fermi.

In order to investigate how the disformal\ncoupling affects the structure of relativistic stars, we propose a minimal\nmodel of a massless scalar-tensor theory and investigate in detail how the\ndisformal coupling affects the spontaneous scalarization of slowly rotating\nneutron stars.

Abstract: We consider the nature of quantum properties in non-relativistic quantum\nmechanics (QM) and relativistic QFTs, and examine the connection between formal\nquantization schemes and intuitive notions of wave-particle duality. Based on\nthe map between classical Poisson brackets and their associated commutators,\nsuch schemes give rise to quantum states obeying canonical dispersion\nrelations, obtained by substituting the de Broglie relations into the relevant\n(classical) energy-momentum relation. In canonical QM, this yields a dispersion\nrelation involving $\\hbar$ but not $c$, whereas the canonical relativistic\ndispersion relation involves both. Extending this logic to the canonical\nquantization of the gravitational field gives rise to loop quantum gravity, and\na map between classical variables containing $G$ and $c$, and associated\ncommutators involving $\\hbar$. This naturally defines a \"wave-gravity duality\",\nsuggesting that a quantum wave packet describing {\\it self-gravitating matter}\nobeys a dispersion relation involving $G$, $c$ and $\\hbar$.

The joint detection of gravitational waves (GW) and\nelectromagnetic (EM) signals from the merging of a binary system of compact\nobjects like neutron stars (NS), can help constrain the geometry of extra\ndimensions beyond our 3+1 spacetime ones. A theoretically well-motivated\npossibility is that our observable Universe is a 3+1-dimensional hypersurface,\nor brane, embedded in a higher 4+1-dimensional Anti-de Sitter (AdS$_5$)\nspacetime, in which gravity is the only force which propagates through the\ninfinite bulk space, while other forces are confined to the brane. In these\ntypes of brane-world models, GW and EM signals between two points on the brane\nwould, in general, travel different paths. This would result in a time-lag\nbetween the detection of GW and EM signals emitted simultaneously from the same\nsource.

We\nshow that the bias is a multivariate function of halo properties that falls\ninto three regimes. For massive haloes, halo mass explains the majority of bias\nvariation. For early-forming haloes, bias depends sensitively on the recent\nmass accretion history. For low-mass and late-forming haloes, bias depends more\non the structure of a halo such as its shape and spin. Our framework enables us\nto convincingly prove that $V_\\mathrm{max}/V_\\mathrm{vir}$ is a lossy proxy of\nformation time for bias modelling, whereas the mass, spin, shape and formation\ntime variables are non-redundant with respect to each other. Combining mass and\nformation time largely accounts for the mass accretion history dependence of\nbias.

In\nthese environments, energetic CRs are virtually collisionless and interact via\ncollective phenomena mediated by kinetic-scale plasma waves and large-scale\nmagnetic fields. The enormous separation of kinetic and global astrophysical\nscales requires a hydrodynamic description. Here, we develop a new macroscopic\ntheory for CR transport in the self-confinement picture, which includes CR\ndiffusion and streaming. The interaction between CRs and electromagnetic fields\nof Alfv\\'enic turbulence provides the main source of CR scattering, and causes\nCRs to stream along the magnetic field with the Alfv\\'en velocity if resonant\nwaves are sufficiently energetic. However, numerical simulations struggle to\ncapture this effect with current transport formalisms and adopt regularization\nschemes to ensure numerical stability. We extent the theory by deriving an\nequation for the CR momentum density along the mean magnetic field and include\na transport equation for the Alfv\\'en-wave energy.

The detection of this gravitational-wave signal, GW170817, offers a\nnovel opportunity to directly probe the properties of matter at the extreme\nconditions found in the interior of these stars. The initial,\nminimal-assumption analysis of the LIGO and Virgo data placed constraints on\nthe tidal effects of the coalescing bodies, which were then translated to\nconstraints on neutron star radii.

However, the\ninformation capacity of the discarded variables will inevitably change as the\nuniverse expands, generating \"quantum bias\" (QB) in the Friedmann equations\n[Phys. Lett.

Proxies exist to evaluate the\nefficiency of mass and angular momentum accretion but they depend so\ndramatically on the wind speed that given the current uncertainties, they only\nset loose constrains. Furthermore, they often bypass the impact of orbital and\nshock effects on the flow structure. We study the wind dynamics and the angular\nmomentum gained as the flow is accreted. We identify the conditions for the\nformation of a disc-like structure around the accretor and the observational\nconsequences for SgXB. We use recent results on the wind launching mechanism to\ncompute 3D streamlines, accounting for the gravitational and X-ray ionizing\ninfluence of the compact companion on the wind. Once the flow enters the Roche\nlobe of the accretor, we solve the hydrodynamics equations with cooling. A\nshocked region forms around the accretor as the flow is beamed. For wind speeds\nof the order of the orbital speed, the shock is highly asymmetric compared to\nthe axisymmetric bow shock obtained for a purely planar homogeneous flow. With\nnet radiative cooling, the flow always circularizes for wind speeds low enough.\nAlthough the donor star does not fill its Roche lobe, the wind can be\nsignificantly beamed and bent by the orbital effects. The net angular momentum\nof the accreted flow is then sufficient to form a persistent disc-like\nstructure. This mechanism could explain the proposed limited outer extension of\nthe accretion disc in Cygnus X-1 and suggests the presence of a disc at the\nouter rim of the neutron star magnetosphere in Vela X-1, with dramatic\nconsequences on the spinning up of the accretor. \n\n"}

Consider a Kerr black hole with a dense plasma torus spinning around it.\nA toroidal electric current flows on the surface of the torus, which generates\na poloidal magnetic field outside the torus. On the surface of the tours the\nmagnetic field is parallel to the surface. The closed magnetic field lines\nwinding around the torus compress and confine the plasma in the torus, as in\nthe case of tokamaks. Though it is unclear if such a model is stable, we look\ninto the consequences if the model is stable. If the magnetic field is strong\nenough, the baryonic contamination from the plasma in the torus is greatly\nsuppressed by the magnetic confinement and a clean magnetosphere of\nelectron-positron pairs is built up around the black hole. Since there are no\nopen magnetic field lines threading the torus and no accretion, the power of\nthe torus is zero. If some magnetic field lines threading the black hole are\nopen and connect with loads, clean energy can be extracted from the Kerr black\nhole by the Blandford-Znajek mechanism.\n  The model may be relevant to gamma-ray bursts. The energy in the Poynting\nflux produced by the Blandford-Znajek mechanism is converted into the kinetic\nenergy of the electron-positron pairs in the magnetosphere around the black\nhole, which generates two oppositely directed jets of electron-positron pairs\nwith super-high bulk Lorentz factors. The jets collide and interact with the\ninterstellar medium, which may produce gamma-ray bursts and the afterglows. \n\n"}

First, the expression of the\nactive mass in Schwarzschild's solution is given for a barotropic perfect\nfluid, both for general relativity (GR) and for an alternative, scalar theory.\nThe principle of the asymptotic method is then recalled and the PN expansion of\nthe active mass is derived. The PN correction to the active mass is made of the\nNewtonian elastic energy, augmented, for the scalar theory, by a term due to\nthe self-reinforcement of the gravitational field. Third, two equations, both\ncorrect to first order, are derived for the geodesic motion of a mass particle:\na \"standard\" one and an \"asymptotic\" one. Finally, the difference between the\nsolutions of these two equations is numerically investigated in the case of\nMercury.

This is due to a practical\nshortcoming of the asymptotic method, which is shown to disappear if one\nreinitializes the asymptotic problem often enough.

First, the radion becomes trapped at a\nvalue much smaller than the size of the extra dimensions today. Second, the\nUniverse expands exponentially, but with a Planck mass smaller than its present\nvalue. Because the Planck mass during inflation is small, density fluctuations\nin agreement with observations can arise naturally. Third, when inflation ends,\nthe Universe reheats, and the radion becomes free to expand once more. During\nthe third phase the Universe is ``radiation-dominated'' and tends toward a\nfixed-point evolutionary model in which the radion grows but the temperature\nremains unchanged. Ultimately, the radion becomes trapped once again at its\npresent value, and a short period of exponential expansion, which we identify\nwith the electroweak phase transition, ensues. Once this epoch is over, the\nUniverse reheats to a temperature of order the electroweak scale, and the\nmature Universe evolves as in standard cosmological models. We show that the\npresent day energy density in radions can be smaller than the closure density\nif the second inflationary epoch lasts about 8 e-foldings or more; the\npresent-day radion mass turns out to be small (less than or of the order of an\neV, depending on parameters).

{"id": "hep-th/9611034", "contents": "Title: Superstrings in Higher Order Extensions of Finsler Superspaces Abstract: The work proposes a geometric background of the theory of field interactions\nand strings in spaces with higher order anisotropy. Our approach proceeds by\ndeveloping the concept of higher order anisotropic superspace which unifies the\nlogical and mathematical aspects of modern Kaluza-Klein theories and\ngeneralized Lagrange and Finsler geometry and leads to modelling of physical\nprocesses on higher order fiber bundles provided with nonlinear and\ndistingushed connections and metric structures. The view adopted is that a\ngeneral field theory should incorporate all possible anisotropic and stochastic\nmanifestations of classical and quantum interactions and, in consequence, a\ncorresponding modification of basic principles and mathematical methods in\nformulation of physical theories. The presentation is divided into two parts.\nThe first five sections cover the higher order anisotropic superspaces. We\nfocus on the geometry of distinguished by nonlinear connection vector\nsuperbundles, consider different supersymmetric extensions of Finsler and\nLagrange spaces and analyze the structure of basic geometric objects on such\nsuperspaces. The remaining five sections are devoted to the theory of higher\norder anisotropic superstrings. In the framework of supersymmetric nonlinear\nsigma models in Finser extended backgrounds we prove that the low-energy\ndynamics of such strings contains motion equations for locally anisotropic\nfield interactions. \n\n"}

The polysymplectic $(n+1)$-form\ngeneralizes the simplectic form and gives rise to a map between horizontal\nforms playing the role of dynamical variables and vertical multivectors\ngeneralizing Hamiltonian vector fields. Graded Poisson bracket is defined on\nforms and leads to the structure of a Z-graded Lie algebra on the subspace of\nthe so-called Hamiltonian forms for which the map above exists. A generalized\nPoisson structure arises in the form of what we call a ``higher-order'' and a\nright Gerstenhaber algebra. Field euations and the equations of motion of forms\nare formulated in terms of the graded Poisson bracket with the DW Hamiltonian\n$n$-form $H\\vol$ ($\\vol$ is the space-time volume form and $H$ is the DW\nHamiltonian function).

This structure implies a natural division of the\nasymptotic domains of the moduli space into regions which can/cannot be mapped\nto Type II string theory or 11D Supergravity (SUGRA) with large radii. We call\nthese the safe and unsafe domains. The safe domain is the interior of the\nfuture light cone in the moduli space while the unsafe domain contains the\nspacelike region and the past light cone. Within the safe domain, apparent\ncosmological singularities can be resolved by duality transformations and we\nbriefly provide a physical picture of how this occurs. The unsafe domains\nrepresent true singularities where all field theoretic description of the\nphysics breaks down. They violate the holographic principle. We argue that this\nstructure provides a natural arrow of time for cosmology.

Also, there are some indications that the radical version of the\nholographic theory in the context of cosmology may have problems with unitarity\nand causality. Another formulation of the holographic principle, due to\nFischler and Susskind, implies that the entropy of matter inside the\npost-inflationary particle horizon must be smaller than the area of the\nhorizon. Their conjecture was very successful for a wide class of open and flat\nuniverses, but it did not apply to closed universes. Bak and Rey proposed a\ndifferent holographic bound on entropy which was valid for closed universes of\na certain type. However, as we will show, neither proposal applies to open,\nflat and closed universes with matter and a small negative cosmological\nconstant. We will argue, in agreement with Easther, Lowe, and Veneziano, that\nwhenever the holographic constraint on the entropy inside the horizon is valid,\nit follows from the Bekenstein-Hawking bound on the black hole entropy.
