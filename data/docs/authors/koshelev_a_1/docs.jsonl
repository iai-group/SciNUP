In Corbino\ngeometry two Ohmic contacts have to be made on the film evaporating Ag or using\nsilver paste: one circle with radius r_a (1) and a ring electrode with internal\nradius r_b (2).

It respects the analog of the Birkhoff theorem, i.e., the\nvacuum spherically symmetric solution is necessarily static. As in general\nrelativity, the spherically symmetric solution is seen to describe a black\nhole. The exterior geometry is essentially the same as in the Schwarzschild\ncase, with power-law corrections to the Newtonian potential. The behavior\ninside the black-hole region is different from the Schwarzschild case in that\nthe usual spacetime singularity gets replaced by a singular surface of a new\ntype, where all basic fields of the theory remain finite but metric ceases to\nexist. The theory does not admit arbitrarily small black holes: for small\nobjects, the curvature on the would-be horizon is so strong that non-metric\nmodifications prevent the horizon from being formed.

This effect originates from the change of the\nshape of the vortex core due to non-equilibrium effects (similar to the\nmechanism of vortex motion instability in the Larkin-Ovchinnikov theory). The\nmoving vortex creates a deficit of quasiparticles in front of its motion and an\nexcess of quasiparticles behind the core of the moving vortex. This results in\nthe appearance of a wake (region with suppressed order parameter) behind the\nvortex which attracts other vortices resulting in an effective\ndirection-dependent interaction between vortices. When the vortex velocity $v$\nreaches the critical value $v_c$ quasi-phase slip lines (lines with fast vortex\nmotion) appear which may coexist with slowly moving vortices between such\nlines. Our results are found within the framework of the time-dependent\nGinzburg-Landau equations and are strictly valid when the coherence length\n$\\xi(T)$ is larger or comparable with the decay length $L_{in}$ of the\nnon-equilibrium quasiparticle distribution function.

The\n'concordance' LCDM model is still a good fit when there is just a 'step' in the\nspectrum. However if there is a 'bump' in the spectrum (due e.g. to two phase\ntransitions in rapid succession), the precision CMB data can be well-fitted by\na flat Einstein-de Sitter cosmology without dark energy.

Recent studies have shown that\nthe tunnelling conductance can be fit using a BCS-type density of states for a\nd-wave superconductor with a local quasiparticle scattering rate. The fit is\nmade with a scattering rate which varies linearly with energy and has a slope\nthat is positively correlated with the local value of the gap. We revisit a\nmodel of quasiparticle scattering by impurities and spin fluctuations which was\npreviously used to describe the lifetimes of nodal quasiparticles measured by\nangle-resolved photoemission (ARPES). We argue that the broadening of the local\ndensity of states is in general determined by the imaginary part of the\nself-energy of the system averaged over a small region. The size of this region\nis set by a mean free path which depends upon the energy. At low energies, this\nregion is found to be significantly larger than a gap \"patch\", so that the\ndensity of states measured by STS is homogeneous in this energy range. At\nhigher energies where the mean free path is comparable with the patch size, the\ndensity of states is inhomogeneous.

The vortex configurations in this system\nare generally different from those observed for single isolated triangular\nsuperconducting samples due to the coupling of vortices in adjacent funnels. At\ncertain matching fields, peaks in the critical current are absent due to the\nparticular vortex configurations that occur at these fields. We find that the\noverall depinning force increases with increasing vortex density as a result of\nthe enhanced vortex-vortex interactions caused by a crowding effect at the\nfunnel tips. When a system becomes less mobile as a result of increased\nparticle interactions, it is said to exhibit a jamming behavior. Under an\napplied drive we observe a series of elastic and plastic vortex flow phases\nwhich produce pronounced features such as jumps or dips in the transport\ncurves. In all of the flow phases, only one vortex can pass through the funnel\ntip at a time due to the vortex-vortex repulsion forces.

A residual linear term k_c0/T is observed in the T = 0 limit when\nthe current is along the c axis, revealing the presence of nodes in the gap.\nBecause the nodes appear as x moves away from the concentration of maximal T_c,\nthey must be accidental, not imposed by symmetry, and are therefore compatible\nwith an s_{+/-} state, for example. The fact that the in-plane residual linear\nterm k_a0/T is negligible at all x implies that the nodes are located in\nregions of the Fermi surface that contribute strongly to c-axis conduction and\nvery little to in-plane conduction. Application of a moderate magnetic field\n(e.g. H_c2/4) excites quasiparticles that conduct heat along the a axis just as\nwell as the nodal quasiparticles conduct along the c axis. This shows that the\ngap must be very small (but non-zero) in regions of the Fermi surface which\ncontribute significantly to in-plane conduction. These findings can be\nunderstood in terms of a strong k dependence of the gap Delta(k) which produces\nnodes on a Fermi surface sheet with pronounced c-axis dispersion and deep\nminima on the remaining, quasi-two-dimensional sheets. \n\n"}

Abstract: The entropic gravity scenario recently proposed by Erik Verlinde reproduced\nthe Newton's law of purely classical gravity yet the key assumptions of this\napproach all have quantum mechanical origins. This is atypical for emergent\nphenomena in physics, where the underlying, more fundamental physics often\nreveals itself as corrections to the leading classical behavior. So one\nnaturally wonders: where is hbar hiding in entropic gravity? To address this\nquestion, we first revisit the idea of holographic screen as well as entropy\nand its variation law in order to obtain a self-consistent approach to the\nproblem. Next we argue that when dealing with quantum gravity issues the\ngeneralized uncertainty principle (GUP) should be the more appropriate\nfoundation. Indeed based on GUP it has been demonstrated that the black hole\nBekenstein entropy area law must be modified not only in the strong but also in\nthe weak gravity regime. In the weak gravity limit, such a GUP modified entropy\nexhibits a logarithmic correction term. When applying it to the entropic\ninterpretation, we demonstrate that the resulting gravity force law does\ninclude sub-leading order correction terms that depend on hbar. Such deviation\nfrom the classical Newton's law may serve as a probe to the validity of the\nentropic gravity postulate. \n\n"}

As the angular momentum approaches its extremal value, the frequency\nspectrum bifurcates into these two distinct branches when both types of modes\nare present.

We begin by a small amplitude\nanalysis, which obtains the central resonant wave numbers, and relate it to\nperturbative processes. We show that the dominant resonance structure is\ndetermined by (i) the nonrelativistic scattering of many quantum particles and\n(ii) the application of Bose-Einstein statistics to the adiabatic and\nisocurvature modes, as introduced in Part 1 [1]. Other resonance structure is\nunderstood in terms of annihilations and decays. We setup Bunch-Davies vacuum\ninitial conditions during inflation and track the evolution of modes including\nHubble expansion. In the case of a complex inflaton carrying an internal U(1)\nsymmetry, we show that when the isocurvature instability is active, the\ninflaton fragments into separate regions of \\phi-particles and\nanti-\\phi-particles. We then introduce a weak breaking of the U(1) symmetry;\nthis can lead to baryogenesis, as shown by some of us recently [2,3]. Then\nusing our results, we compute corrections to the particle-antiparticle\nasymmetry from this preheating era. \n\n"}

Using\nquasiclassical Green's function method, we show that the magnetization becomes\nfinite inside N. The origin of this magnetization is due to odd-frequency\nspin-triplet Cooper pairs formed by electrons of equal and opposite spins,\nwhich are induced by proximity effect in the S/F1/N/F2/S junction. We find that\nthe magnetization M(d,q) in N can be decomposed into two parts,\nM(d,q)=MI(d)+MII(d,q), where q is the superconducting phase difference between\ntwo Ss and d is the thickness of N. MI(d) exists generally in S/F junctions,\nwhile MII(d,q) carries all q dependence and represents the fingerprint of phase\ncoherence between two Ss in Josephson junctions. The q dependence thus allows\nus to control the magnetization in N by tuning q for a fixed d. We show that\nMI(d) weakly decreases with increasing d, while the q dependent magnetization\nMII(d,q) rapidly decays with d. Moreover, we find that the time-averaged\nmagnetization <MII(d,q)> exhibits discontinuous peak at each resonance DC\nvoltage Vn=nhw_S/2e(n: integer) when DC voltage V as well as AC voltage v_ac(t)\nwith frequency w_S are both applied to the S/F1/N/F2/S junction.

We also discuss that\nthe magnetization induced in N can be measurably large in realistic systems.\nTherefore, the measurement of the induced magnetization serves as an\nalternative way to detect the phase coherence between two Ss in Josephson\njunctions.

For Renyi\nentropies, these terms are known to be similar to the von Neumann entropy,\nwhile being much more amenable to numerical and even experimental measurement.\nWe show here that when calculating universal properties of Renyi entropies, it\nis important to account for unusual corrections to scaling that arise from\nrelevant local operators present at the conical singularity in the\nmulti-sheeted Riemann surface. These corrections grow in importance with\nincreasing Renyi index.

One might even worry that in a de Sitter background, light species\nwill lead to a violation of the covariant entropy bound at large $N$.

Abstract: Magnetism and nematic order are the two non-superconducting orders observed\nin iron-based superconductors.

For the calculation of this quantity it is sufficient to\nfind a map between the Killing times $u_+$ and $u_-$ at the future and past\nnull infinities, established by the propagation of the radial null rays. In\nthis formalism the quantum energy flux at the future null infinity can be\nexpressed in terms of the function $u_+(u_-)$ and its derivatives. We developed\na special formalism, which allows one to reduce the problem of the calculation\nof the quantum energy flux and other observables to a solution of a simple set\nof ordinary differential equations. We used this approach to study quantum\neffects in two cases: i) with the trivial, $\\alpha=1$ and ii) the non-trivial,\n$\\alpha\\ne1$, redshift function. In both cases there exists an outburst of the\nquantum energy radiation from the inner domain of the black hole, close to the\ninner part of its apparent horizon. For $\\alpha=1$ this outburst is\nexponentially large. It is a direct consequence of the so-called mass inflation\neffect. We showed, that this severe problem can be solved by a proper choice of\nthe redshift function. However, even in this case the emitted energy can be\nmuch larger than the initial mass of the evaporating black hole. This means\nthat for a construction of a self-consistent model of a non-singular\nevaporating black hole the back-reaction effects are highly important. \n\n"}

Using a combination of analytical and numerical methods we study\nthe diabatic errors in Majorana-based topological Y-junction that are coupled\nto a Bosonic bath in the Markovian approximation.

We call this\nscenario the LXCDM model. One possibility for X would be a scalar field, but it\nis not the only one. The overall equation of state (EOS) of the LXCDM model can\neffectively appear as quintessence or phantom energy depending on the mixture\nof the two components. Both the dynamics of Lambda and of X could be linked to\nhigh energy effects near the Planck scale. In the case of Lambda it may be\nrelated to the running of this parameter under quantum effects, whereas X might\nbe identified with some fundamental field (say, a dilaton) left over as a\nlow-energy ``relic'' by e.g. string theory.

It may\noccur in an expanding universe if the initial amplitude of oscillations of the\ninflaton field is large enough.

It occurs in a very unusual stochastic manner, which is\ndifferent from the parametric resonance in the case when the expansion of the\nuniverse is neglected. Quantum fields interacting with the oscillating inflaton\nfield experience a series of kicks which occur with phases uncorrelated to each\nother. We call this process stochastic resonance.

In this limit the Higgs\nfield disappears at the spatial infinity, but it leaves, nevertheless, its\ntrace as vacuum Yang-Mills BPS monopoles transformed into Wu-Yang monopoles\nobtained in the pure Yang-Mills theory by a spontaneous scale symmetry breaking\nin the class of functions with zero topological charges. The topological\ndegeneration of a vacuum BPS monopole manifests itself via Gribov copies of the\ncovariant Coulomb gauge in the form of the time integral of the Gauss law\nconstraint. We also show that, in the considered theory, there is a zero mode\nof the Gauss constraint involving an \"electric\" monopole and the additional\nmass of the $\\eta'$-meson in Minkowskian QCD. The consequences of the\nMinkowskian physical monopole vacuum: rising \"golden section\" potential and\ntopological confinement, are studied in the framework of the perturbation\ntheory. An estimation of the vacuum expectation value of the square of the\nmagnetic tension is given through the $\\eta'$-meson mass, and arguments in\nfavour of the stability of the monopole vacuum are considered. We also discuss\nwhy all these \"smiles\" of the Cheshire cat are kept by the Dirac fundamental\nquantization, but not by the conventional Faddeev-Popov integral. \n\n"}

Namely, topological action functionals\nfor gauge fields (generalizing Chern-Simons and BF theories) are considered\ntogether with generalized Wilson loops.
