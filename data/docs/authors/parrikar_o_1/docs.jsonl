Structures that collapse prior to the era of\n$\\Lambda$-domination will lose causal contact with our Hubble volume within a\nfinite (short) conformal time $\\tau_{\\ast}$. Any remnants within our Hubble\nvolume then suffer a cosmological heat death after the universe becomes DS. The\nprobability for finding observers by random measurements in the volume bound by\nthe DeSitter horizon is $P \\simeq 0$, and it is a simple consequence of the\ninformation loss problem for eternal DS spaces resulting from the finite and\nconstant value of its temperature $T_{DS} \\simeq \\Lambda^{-1/2}$ and entropy $S\n= 3/(G\\Lambda)$.

The Kahler metric is singular at the origin of field\nspace due to the presence of quasi-hidden sector states which get their mass\nfrom the Higgs vevs. The presence of these extra states leads to the fact that\neven as Delta approaches 1, the DSSM does not reduce to the MSSM. In\nparticular, the Higgs can naturally be heavier than the W- and Z-bosons.\nPerturbative gauge coupling unification, a large top quark Yukawa, and\nconsistency with precision electroweak can all be maintained for Delta close to\nunity. Moreover, such values of Delta can naturally be obtained in\nstring-motivated constructions.

A unique entropy can be assigned to algebras with center, giving place\nto a local entropy in lattice gauge theories. However, ambiguities arise on the\ncorrespondence between algebras and regions. In particular, it is always\npossible to choose (in many different ways) local algebras with trivial center,\nand hence a genuine entanglement entropy, for any region.

This interpretation entails a gauge\nfixing dependence of the entanglement entropy.

In a holographic context, such small gaps are associated to the\nappearance of horizons and singularities in the dual spacetime.

Abstract: Of course not, but if one believes that information cannot be destroyed in a\ntheory of quantum gravity, then we run into apparent contradictions with\nquantum theory when we consider evaporating black holes. Namely that the\nno-cloning theorem or the principle of entanglement monogamy is violated. Here,\nwe show that neither violation need hold, since, in arguing that black holes\nlead to cloning or non-monogamy, one needs to assume a tensor product structure\nbetween two points in space-time that could instead be viewed as causally\nconnected. In the latter case, one is violating the semi-classical causal\nstructure of space, which is a strictly weaker implication than cloning or\nnon-monogamy. We show that the lack of monogamy that can emerge in evaporating\nspace times is one that is allowed in quantum mechanics, and is very naturally\nrelated to a lack of monogamy of correlations of outputs of measurements\nperformed at subsequent instances of time of a single system. A particular\nexample of this is the Horowitz-Maldacena proposal, and we argue that it\nneedn't lead to cloning or violations of entanglement monogamy. For\nmeasurements on systems which appear to be leaving a black hole, we introduce\nthe notion of the temporal product, and argue that it is just as natural a\nchoice for measurements as the tensor product. For black holes, the tensor and\ntemporal products have the same measurement statistics, but result in different\ntype of non-monogamy of correlations, with the former being forbidden in\nquantum theory while the latter is allowed. In the case of the AMPS firewall\nexperiment we find that the entanglement structure is modified, and one must\nhave entanglement between the infalling Hawking partners and early time\noutgoing Hawking radiation which surprisingly tame violation of entanglement\nmonogamy. \n\n"}

Along compact\ndimensions periodicity conditions are considered with general values of the\nphases and on the branes Robin boundary conditions are imposed for the field\noperator. In addition, we assume the presence of a constant gauge field. The\nlatter gives rise to Aharonov-Bohm type effect on the vacuum currents. There\nexists a range in the space of the Robin coefficients for separate branes where\nthe vacuum state becomes unstable. Compared to the case of the standard AdS\nbulk, in models with compact dimensions the stability condition imposed on the\nparameters is less restrictive. The current density has nonzero components\nalong compact dimensions only. These components are decomposed into the\nbrane-free and brane-induced contributions. The component along a given compact\ndimension is a periodic function of the gauge field flux, enclosed by that\ndimension, with the period of the flux quantum. An important feature, that\ndistinguishes the current density from the expectation values of the field\nsquared and energy-momentum tensor, is its finiteness on the branes.

We generalize the Stone-von Neumann theorem to matrices that\napproximately satisfy the canonical (Heisenberg-Weyl-type) commutation\nrelations, and use this to show that approximate symmetry operators can certify\nthe degeneracy of the ground space even though they only approximately form a\ngroup.

Both the irreducible\nrepresentations of the Clifford algebra are considered. On the ring edges the\nbag (infinite mass) boundary conditions are imposed for the field operator.\nThis leads to the Casimir type effect on the vacuum characteristics. The radial\ncurrent vanishes. The charge and the azimuthal current are decomposed into the\nboundary-free and boundary-induced contributions. Both these contributions are\nodd periodic functions of the magnetic flux with the period equal to the flux\nquantum. An important feature that distinguishes the VEVs of the charge and\ncurrent densities from the VEV of the energy density, is their finiteness on\nthe ring edges. The current density is equal to the charge density for the\nouter edge and has the opposite sign on the inner edge. The VEVs are peaked\nnear the inner edge and, as functions of the field mass, exhibit quite\ndifferent features for two inequivalent representations of the Clifford\nalgebra. We show that, unlike the VEVs in the boundary-free geometry, the\nvacuum charge and the current in the ring are continuous functions of the\nmagnetic flux and vanish for half-odd integer values of the flux in units of\nthe flux quantum. Combining the results for two irreducible representations, we\nalso investigate the induced charge and current in parity and time-reversal\nsymmetric models. The corresponding results are applied to graphene rings with\nthe electronic subsystem described in terms of the effective Dirac theory with\nthe energy gap. If the energy gaps for two valleys of the graphene hexagonal\nlattice are the same, the charge densities corresponding to the separate\nvalleys cancel each other, whereas the azimuthal current is doubled. \n\n"}

For $G\n= SU(2)_k$, we study various two and three component links.

Abstract: We investigate an entangled system, which is analogous to a composite system\nof a black hole and Hawking radiation. If Hawking radiation is well\napproximated by an outgoing particle generated from pair creation around the\nblack hole, such a pair creation increases the total number of states. There\nshould be a unitary mechanism to reduce the number of states inside the horizon\nfor black hole evaporation. Because the infalling antiparticle has negative\nenergy, as long as the infalling antiparticle finds its partner such that the\ntwo particles form a separable state, one can trace out such a zero energy\nsystem by maintaining unitarity. In this paper, based on some toy model\ncalculations, we show that such a unitary tracing-out process is only possible\nbefore the Page time while it is impossible after the Page time. Hence, after\nthe Page time, if we assume that the process is unitary and the Hawking pair\nforms a separable state, the internal number of states will monotonically\nincrease, which is supported by the Almheiri-Marolf-Polchinski-Sully (AMPS)\nargument. In addition, the Hawking particles cannot generate randomness of the\nentire system; hence, the entanglement entropy cannot reach its maximum. Based\non these results, we modify the correct form of the Page curve for the remnant\npicture. The most important conclusion is this: if we assume unitarity,\nsemi-classical quantum field theory, and general relativity, then the black\nhole should violate the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy bound around the Page time\nat the latest; hence, the infinite production arguments for remnants might be\napplied for semi-classical black holes, which seems very problematic. \n\n"}

In this paper we study and quantify the\nimplications of the presence of the above term in the context of vacuum $f(R)$.\nParticularly, we assume that axionic dark matter is present during inflation,\nand we examine in a quantitative way the effects of axionic Chern-Simons terms\non the tensor perturbations. The axion field is quantified in terms of a\ncanonical scalar field, with broken Peccei-Quinn symmetry. The model perfectly\ndescribing axions as potential dark matter candidates is based on the so-called\nmisalignment mechanism, in which case the axion is frozen near its non-zero\nvacuum expectation value during early times in which $H\\gg m_a$. In effect, the\ninflationary era is mainly controlled by the $f(R)$ gravity and the\nChern-Simons term. As we demonstrate, the Chern-Simons term may achieve to make\na non-viable $f(R)$ gravity theory to be phenomenologically viable, due to the\nfact that the tensor-to-scalar ratio is significantly reduced, and the same\napplies to the spectral index of the tensor perturbations $n_T$. Also by\nstudying the Starobinsky model in the presence of the Chern-Simons term, we\ndemonstrate that it is possible to further reduce the amount of primordial\ngravitational radiation. The issues of having parity violating gravitational\nwaves, also the graceful exit from inflation due to axion oscillations and\nfinally the unification of dark energy-inflation and axion dark matter in the\nsame $f(R)$ gravity-axion dark matter model, are also briefly discussed. \n\n"}

{"id": "quant-ph/0701004", "contents": "Title: The geometry of quantum computation Abstract: Determining the quantum circuit complexity of a unitary operation is closely\nrelated to the problem of finding minimal length paths in a particular curved\ngeometry [Nielsen et al, Science 311, 1133-1135 (2006)]. This paper\ninvestigates many of the basic geometric objects associated to this space,\nincluding the Levi-Civita connection, the geodesic equation, the curvature, and\nthe Jacobi equation. We show that the optimal Hamiltonian evolution for\nsynthesis of a desired unitary necessarily obeys a simple universal geodesic\nequation. As a consequence, once the initial value of the Hamiltonian is set,\nsubsequent changes to the Hamiltonian are completely determined by the geodesic\nequation. We develop many analytic solutions to the geodesic equation, and a\nset of invariants that completely determine the geodesics. We investigate the\nproblem of finding minimal geodesics through a desired unitary, U, and develop\na procedure which allows us to deform the (known) geodesics of a simple and\nwell understood metric to the geodesics of the metric of interest in quantum\ncomputation. This deformation procedure is illustrated using some three-qubit\nnumerical examples. We study the computational complexity of evaluating\ndistances on Riemmanian manifolds, and show that no efficient classical\nalgorithm for this problem exists, subject to the assumption that good\npseudorandom generators exist. Finally, we develop a canonical extension\nprocedure for unitary operations which allows ancilla qubits to be incorporated\ninto the geometric approach to quantum computing. \n\n"}

{"id": "quant-ph/9907047", "contents": "Title: Distributed Entanglement Abstract: Consider three qubits A, B, and C which may be entangled with each other. We\nshow that there is a trade-off between A's entanglement with B and its\nentanglement with C. This relation is expressed in terms of a measure of\nentanglement called the \"tangle,\" which is related to the entanglement of\nformation. Specifically, we show that the tangle between A and B, plus the\ntangle between A and C, cannot be greater than the tangle between A and the\npair BC. This inequality is as strong as it could be, in the sense that for any\nvalues of the tangles satisfying the corresponding equality, one can find a\nquantum state consistent with those values. Further exploration of this result\nleads to a definition of the \"three-way tangle\" of the system, which is\ninvariant under permutations of the qubits. \n\n"}
