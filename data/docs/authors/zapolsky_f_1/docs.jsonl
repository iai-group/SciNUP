The\nconventional, standard adiabatic quantum computation proceeds along\neigenenergies of parameter-dependent Hamiltonians. By contrast, discrete\nadiabatic computation utilizes adiabatic passage along the quasienergies of\nparameter-dependent unitary operators. For example, such computation can be\nrealized by a concatenation of parameterized quantum circuits, with an\nadiabatic though inevitably discrete change of the parameter. A design\nprinciple of adiabatic passage along quasienergy is recently proposed: Cheon's\nquasienergy and eigenspace anholonomies on unitary operators is available to\nrealize anholonomic adiabatic algorithms [Tanaka and Miyamoto, Phys. Rev. Lett.\n98, 160407 (2007)], which compose a nontrivial family of discrete adiabatic\nalgorithms.

We give an example of an f_omega-productive sequence\n{a_n: n in N} in a (necessarily non-abelian) separable metric group H with a\nlinear topology and a bijection s: N --> N such that the sequence {prod_{n=0}^m\na_{s(n)}: m in N} diverges, thereby answering a question of Dominguez and\nTarieladze.

We focus in this\npaper on subclasses of abelian groups, and show that these problems are much\nharder: Omega(|Gamma|^{1/6}) queries are necessary to test if the input is\nclose to a cyclic group, and Omega(|Gamma|^c) queries for some constant c are\nnecessary to test more generally if the input is close to an abelian group\ngenerated by k elements, for any fixed integer k>0.

We prove two complementary results that confirm this\nintuition. First, we show that a low-rank density matrix can be estimated using\nfewer copies of the state, i.e., the sample complexity of tomography decreases\nwith the rank. Second, we show that unknown low-rank states can be\nreconstructed from an incomplete set of measurements, using techniques from\ncompressed sensing and matrix completion. These techniques use simple Pauli\nmeasurements, and their output can be certified without making any assumptions\nabout the unknown state.\n  We give a new theoretical analysis of compressed tomography, based on the\nrestricted isometry property (RIP) for low-rank matrices. Using these tools, we\nobtain near-optimal error bounds, for the realistic situation where the data\ncontains noise due to finite statistics, and the density matrix is full-rank\nwith decaying eigenvalues. We also obtain upper-bounds on the sample complexity\nof compressed tomography, and almost-matching lower bounds on the sample\ncomplexity of any procedure using adaptive sequences of Pauli measurements.\n  Using numerical simulations, we compare the performance of two compressed\nsensing estimators with standard maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE). We find\nthat, given comparable experimental resources, the compressed sensing\nestimators consistently produce higher-fidelity state reconstructions than MLE.\nIn addition, the use of an incomplete set of measurements leads to faster\nclassical processing with no loss of accuracy.\n  Finally, we show how to certify the accuracy of a low rank estimate using\ndirect fidelity estimation and we describe a method for compressed quantum\nprocess tomography that works for processes with small Kraus rank. \n\n"}

More\nspecifically, we address systems where the Gaussian approximation fails, i.e.\nthe sole knowledge of the spectrum is not enough to determine the dynamics of\nquantum correlations. We thus investigate the dynamics for two different\nconfigurations of the environment: in the first case the noise spectrum is due\nto the interaction of each qubit with a single bistable fluctuator with an\nundetermined switching rate, whereas in the second case we consider a\ncollection of classical fluctuators with fixed switching rates. In both cases\nwe found analytical expressions for the time dependence of entanglement and\nquantum discord, which may be also extended to a collection of flcutuators with\nrandom switching rates. The environmental noise is introduced by means of\nstochastic time-dependent terms in the Hamiltonian and this allows us to\ndescribe the effects of both separate and common environments. We show that the\nnon-Gaussian character of the noise may lead to significant effects, e.g.\nenvironments with the same power spectrum, but different configurations, give\nraise to opposite behavior for the quantum correlations. In particular,\ndepending on the characteristics of the environmental noise considered, both\nentanglement and discord display either a monotonic decay or the phenomena of\nsudden death and revivals. Our results show that the microscopic structure of\nenvironment, besides its noise spectrum, is relevant for the dynamics of\nquantum correlations, and may be a valid starting point for the engineering of\nnon-Gaussian colored environments. \n\n"}

Here we show that there is, within the Shabani-Lidar\nframework, no scope for any distinguished role for quantum discord in respect\nof complete positivity of reduced dynamics. Since most applications of quantum\ntheory to real systems rests on the traditional scheme, its robustness\ndemonstrated here could be of far-reaching significance. \n\n"}

We show that\nfermionic systems can have edge phases with only bosonic low-energy excitations\nand discuss a fermionic generalization of the relation between bulk topological\nspins and the central charge. The latter follows from our demonstration that\nevery fermionic topological phase can be represented as a bosonic topological\nphase, together with some number of filled Landau levels. Our analysis shows\nthat every Abelian topological phase can be decomposed into a tensor product of\ntheories associated with prime numbers $p$ in which every quasiparticle has a\ntopological spin that is a $p^n$-th root of unity for some $n$. It also leads\nto a simple demonstration that all Abelian topological phases can be\nrepresented by $U(1)^N$ Chern-Simons theory parameterized by a K-matrix. \n\n"}

Barrett and T. Rudolph,\nNature Physics 8, 475 (2012)), models in which quantum states correspond to\nprobability distributions over the values of some underlying physical variables\nmust have the following feature: the distributions corresponding to distinct\nquantum states do not overlap. This is significant because if the distributions\ndo not overlap, then the quantum state itself is encoded by the physical\nvariables. In such a model, it cannot coherently be maintained that the quantum\nstate merely encodes information about underlying physical variables. The\ntheorem, however, considers only models in which the physical variables\ncorresponding to independently prepared systems are independent. This work\nconsiders models that are defined for a single quantum system of dimension $d$,\nsuch that the independence condition does not arise. We prove a result in a\nsimilar spirit to the original no-go theorem, in the form of an upper bound on\nthe extent to which the probability distributions can overlap, consistently\nwith reproducing quantum predictions. In particular, models in which the\nquantum overlap between pure states is equal to the classical overlap between\nthe corresponding probability distributions cannot reproduce the quantum\npredictions in any dimension $d \\geq 3$.

For two-player nonlocal games, it is\nknown that both the classical and the non-signaling value of any game converges\nto zero exponentially fast under parallel repetition, given that the game is\nnon-trivial to start with (i.e., has classical/non-signaling value <1). Very\nrecent results show similar behavior for the quantum value of a two-player game\nunder parallel repetition. For nonlocal games with three or more players, very\nlittle is known up to present on their behavior under parallel repetition; this\nis true for the classical, the quantum and the non-signaling value.\n  In this work, we show a parallel repetition theorem for the non-signaling\nvalue of a large class of multi-player games, for an arbitrary number of\nplayers. Our result applies to all multi-player games for which all possible\ncombinations of questions have positive probability; this class in particular\nincludes all free games, in which the questions to the players are chosen\nindependently. Specifically, we prove that if the original game has a\nnon-signaling value smaller than 1, then the non-signaling value of the\n$n$-fold parallel repetition is exponentially small in $n$.\n  Our parallel repetition theorem for multi-player games is weaker than the\nknown parallel repetition results for two-player games in that the rate at\nwhich the non-signaling value of the game decreases not only depends on the\nnon-signaling value of the original game (and the number of possible\nresponses), but on the complete description of the game.

Here, we propose a generalized\nformulation of quantum theory without predefined time or causal structure,\nbuilding upon a recently introduced operationally time-symmetric approach to\nquantum theory. The key idea is a novel isomorphism between transformations and\nstates which depends on the symmetry transformation of time reversal.

We derive bounds for the number $m$ of\nmeasurements that guarantee successful uniform recovery of Hermitian rank $r$\nmatrices, either for the vectors $a_j$, $j=1,...,m$, being chosen independently\nat random according to a standard Gaussian distribution, or $a_j$ being sampled\nindependently from an (approximate) complex projective $t$-design with $t=4$.\nIn the Gaussian case, we require $m \\geq C r n$ measurements, while in the case\nof $4$-designs we need $m \\geq Cr n \\log(n)$.

Similar to classical\ntime-frequency or time-scale representations, the representation coefficients\nare obtained as inner products with the elements of a continuously indexed\nfamily of time-frequency atoms. These atoms are obtained from a single\nprototype function, by means of modulation, translation and warping. By warping\nwe refer to the process of nonlinear evaluation according to a bijective,\nincreasing function, the warping function.

For each integrable\nnonlinear evolution equation (NLEE) in the hierarchy, dual integrable\nstructures are characterized by the fact that the zero-curvature representation\nof the NLEE can be realized by two Hamiltonian formulations stemming from two\ndistinct choices of the configuration space, yielding two inequivalent Poisson\nstructures on the corresponding phase space and two distinct Hamiltonians. This\nis fundamentally different from the standard bi-Hamiltonian or generally\nmultitime structure. The first formulation chooses purely space-dependent\nfields as configuration space; it yields the standard Poisson structure for\nNLS. The other one is new: it chooses purely time-dependent fields as\nconfiguration space and yields a different Poisson structure at each level of\nthe hierarchy. The corresponding NLEE becomes a {\\it space} evolution equation.\nWe emphasize the role of the Lagrangian formulation as a unifying framework for\nderiving both Poisson structures, using ideas from covariant field theory. One\nof our main results is to show that the two matrices of the Lax pair satisfy\nthe same form of ultralocal Poisson algebra (up to a sign) characterized by an\n$r$-matrix structure, whereas traditionally only one of them is involved in the\nclassical $r$-matrix method.

We will argue that there exists a general confusion\nwithin the foundational literature arising from the improper \"scrambling\" of\ntwo different meanings of quantum contextuality. While the first one,\nintroduced by Bohr, is related to an epistemic interpretation of contextuality\nwhich stresses the incompatibility (or complementarity) of certain measurement\nsituations described in classical terms; the second meaning of contextuality is\nrelated to a purely formal understanding of contextuality as exposed by the\nKochen-Specker (KS) theorem which focuses instead on the constraints of the\northodox quantum formalism in order to interpret projection operators as\npreexistent or actual (definite valued) properties. We will show how these two\nnotions have been scrambled together creating an \"omelette of contextuality\"\nwhich has been fully widespread through a popularized \"epistemic explanation\"\nof the KS theorem according to which: The measurement outcome of the observable\nA when measured together with B or together with C will necessarily differ in\ncase [A, B] = [A, C] = 0, and [B, C] /= 0.

The\nthree considered methods exploit different properties of the scattering matrix\n$S(\\mathscr{E};E)$ as a function of energy $E$: its poles, real values, and\nzeros of the second derivative of its phase. The essential feature of the\nmethod of zeroing the resolvent, which produces complex energies, is the\nunlimited growth of the wave function at infinity, which is, however,\neliminated by the time-dependent interpretation. The real energies at which the\nunitary scattering matrix becomes real correspond to the largest possible\ndistortion, $S=+1$, or its absence at $S=-1$ which in either case leads to the\nformation of quasibound states.

A framework of\nstandard Borel spaces is adopted; and this generality is wide enough to cover a\nhost of applications. While the mathematical structures of positive operators,\nendomorphisms, transfer operators, measurable partitions, and Markov processes\narise in a host of settings, both pure and applied, we propose here a unified\nstudy.

Nonetheless, we\nprove a number of analogues of the more familiar finite-dimensional settings,\nfor example, the Perron-Frobenius theorem for positive matrices, and the\ncorresponding Markov chains.

As another application, we use causal reference frames to revisit\na thought experiment where the gravitational time dilation due to a massive\nobject in a quantum superposition of positions leads to a superposition of the\ncausal ordering of two events. \n\n"}

The current industry standard is Clifford randomized benchmarking\n(RB), which measures a single error rate that quantifies overall performance.\nBut scaling Clifford RB to many qubits is surprisingly hard. It has only been\nperformed on 1, 2, and 3 qubits as of this writing. This reflects a fundamental\ninefficiency in Clifford RB: the $n$-qubit Clifford gates at its core have to\nbe compiled into large circuits over the 1- and 2-qubit gates native to a\ndevice. As $n$ grows, the quality of these Clifford gates quickly degrades,\nmaking Clifford RB impractical at relatively low $n$. In this Letter, we\npropose a direct RB protocol that mostly avoids compiling. Instead, it uses\nrandom circuits over the native gates in a device, seeded by an initial layer\nof Clifford-like randomization. We demonstrate this protocol experimentally on\n2 -- 5 qubits, using the publicly available IBMQX5. We believe this to be the\ngreatest number of qubits holistically benchmarked, and this was achieved on a\nfreely available device without any special tuning up.

In this paper, we have investigated the interaction of an artificial\natom and SAWs beyond the weak coupling regime, focusing on the role of the\ninterdigital transducer (IDT) that enables the coupling. We find a parameter\nregime in which the IDT acts as a cavity for the atom, rather than an antenna.\nIn other words, the atom forms its own cavity. Similar to an atom coupled to an\nexplicit cavity, this regime is characterized by vacuum-Rabi splitting, as the\natom hybridizes with the phononic vacuum inside the IDT. This hybridization is\npossible because of the interdigitated coupling, which has a large spatial\nextension, and the slow propagation speed of SAWs.

Important\ntopical applications, in particular in high energy particle physics and\ncosmology, involve dynamics of quantum fields far away from the ground state or\nthermal equilibrium. In these cases, standard approaches based on small\ndeviations from equilibrium, or on a sufficient homogeneity in time underlying\nkinetic descriptions, are not applicable. A particular challenge is to connect\nthe far-from-equilibrium dynamics at early times with the approach to thermal\nequilibrium at late times.

These separability\ntests can be ordered in a hierarchical structure whose first step corresponds\nto the well-known Positive Partial Transpose (Peres-Horodecki) criterion, and\neach test in the hierarchy is at least as powerful as the preceding one. This\nhierarchy is complete, in the sense that any entangled state is guaranteed to\nfail a test at some finite point in the hierarchy, thus showing it is\nentangled. The entanglement witnesses corresponding to each step of the\nhierarchy have well-defined and very interesting algebraic properties that in\nturn allow for a characterization of the interior of the set of positive maps.\nCoupled with some recent results on the computational complexity of the\nseparability problem, which has been shown to be NP-hard, this hierarchy of\ntests gives a complete and also computationally and theoretically appealing\ncharacterization of mixed bipartite entangled states. \n\n"}

These hidden subgroup problems are typically solved by\nFourier sampling. When G is nonabelian, two important variants of Fourier\nsampling have been identified: the weak standard method, where only\nrepresentation names are measured, and the strong standard method, where full\nmeasurement (i.e., the row and column of the representation, in a suitably\nchosen basis) occurs. It has remained open whether the strong standard method\nis indeed stronger. In this article, we settle this question in the\naffirmative.
