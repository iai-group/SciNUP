Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on\nthe role that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in\nglobular clusters, e.g., influencing the distribution of horizontal branch\nstars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of some globular clusters, and in\nforming low mass white dwarfs. \n\n"}

High resolution radio images are presented of the best high redshift FRI\ncandidate galaxies, drawn from two fields of the Leiden Berkeley Deep Survey,\nand previously defined in Rigby, Snellen & Best (2007, Paper I).

We presume the nebula to be weakly turbulent, which\nleads to dense concentrations of aerodynamically size-sorted particles having\nproperties like those observed in chondrites. The fractional volume of the\nnebula occupied by these dense zones or clumps obeys a probability distribution\nas a function of their density, and the densest concentrations have particle\nmass density 100 times that of the gas. However, even these densest clumps are\nprevented by gas pressure from undergoing gravitational instability in the\ntraditional sense (on a dynamical timescale).

{"id": "0809.4624", "contents": "Title: CMB likelihood approximation by a Gaussianized Blackwell-Rao estimator Abstract: We introduce a new CMB temperature likelihood approximation called the\nGaussianized Blackwell-Rao (GBR) estimator. This estimator is derived by\ntransforming the observed marginal power spectrum distributions obtained by the\nCMB Gibbs sampler into standard univariate Gaussians, and then approximate\ntheir joint transformed distribution by a multivariate Gaussian. The method is\nexact for full-sky coverage and uniform noise, and an excellent approximation\nfor sky cuts and scanning patterns relevant for modern satellite experiments\nsuch as WMAP and Planck. A single evaluation of this estimator between l=2 and\n200 takes ~0.2 CPU milliseconds, while for comparison, a single pixel space\nlikelihood evaluation between l=2 and 30 for a map with ~2500 pixels requires\n~20 seconds. We apply this tool to the 5-year WMAP temperature data, and\nre-estimate the angular temperature power spectrum, $C_{\\ell}$, and likelihood,\nL(C_l), for l<=200, and derive new cosmological parameters for the standard\nsix-parameter LambdaCDM model. Our spectrum is in excellent agreement with the\nofficial WMAP spectrum, but we find slight differences in the derived\ncosmological parameters.

In that case, we found that the sub-optimal likelihood approximation\nadopted between l=12 and 30 by the WMAP team biased n_s low by 0.4 sigma, while\nhere we find that the same approximation between l=30 and 200 introduces a bias\nof 0.6 sigma in n_s. \n\n"}

A Na overabundance has also been reported in some giants\nof open clusters but remains controversial. The cause of the extra-mixing has\nbeen attributed to thermohaline convection that should take place after the RGB\nbump for low-mass stars and on the early-AGB for more massive objects.

A group of first ascent red giants with M/Msun \\leq 2.5 exhibits\nlower [N/C] ratios than those measured in clump giants of the same mass range,\nsuggesting an additional increase in the [N/C] ratio after the first dredge-up.\nThe sodium abundances corrected from NLTE are found to be about solar. [Na/Fe]\nshows a slight increase of 0.10 dex as a function of stellar mass in the 1.8 to\n3.2 Msun range covered by our sample, in agreement with standard first\ndredge-up predictions. Our results do not support previous claims of sodium\noverabundances as high as +0.60 dex. An anti-correlation between 12C/13C and\nturn-off mass is identified and interpreted as being caused by a post-bump\nthermohaline mixing. Moreover, we find low 12C/13C ratios in a few\nintermediate-mass early-AGB stars, confirming that an extra-mixing process also\noperates in stars that do not experienced the RGB bump. In this case, the\nextra-mixing possibly acts on the early-AGB, in agreement with theoretical\nexpectations for thermohaline mixing. [abridged] \n\n"}

In this paper we investigate the existence of\nrealistic chances of such a discovery selecting some nearby dwarf spheroidal\ngalaxies (dSph) as a target. We study the detectability with the Fermi-LAT of\nthe gamma-ray flux from DM annihilation in Draco, Ursa Minor, Carina, and\nSextans, for which the state-of-art DM density profiles were available. We\nassume the DM is made of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles such as the\nLightest Supersymmetric Particle (LSP) and compute the expected gamma-ray flux\nfor optimistic choices of the unknown underlying particle physics parameters.\nWe then compute the boost factors due to the presence of DM clumps and of a\ncentral supermassive black hole. Finally, we compare our predictions with the\nFermi-LAT sensitivity maps. We find that the dSph galaxies shine above the\nGalactic smooth halo: e.g., the Galactic halo is brighter than the Draco dSph\nonly for angles smaller than 2.3 degrees above the Galactic Center. We also\nfind that the presence of a cusp or a constant density core in the DM mass\ndensity profile does not produce any relevant effect in the gamma-ray flux due\nto the fortunate combination of the geometrical acceptance of the Fermi-LAT\ndetector and the distance of the galaxies and that no significant enhancement\nis given by the presence of a central black hole or a population of\nsub-subhalos.

Different analysis methods have been proposed for this purpose, but so\nfar, no comparative test has been performed to test their validity.

We studied\nthe effect of disk structure (flared vs. flat), inclination angle, size of the\ninner disk hole and stellar luminosity on the fitted chemical composition. Our\nresults show that the derived dust compositions by all methods deviate\nsystematically from the real chemical composition. Out of the four tested\nspectral decomposition methods, our new two-layer temperature distribution\nmethod, differs the least from the input dust composition and the results show\nthe weakest systematic effects. The reason for the deviations of the results\ngiven by other methods lies in their simplifying assumptions (e.g. single\naverage grain temperature or one component continuum).

This paper looks at the\neffect of large planetesimal eccentricities (e>>0.3) on their collisional\nlifetime and the amount of mass that can remain at late times M_{late}. For an\naxisymmetric planetesimal disk with common pericentres and eccentricities e, we\nfind that M_{late} \\propto e^{-5/3}(1+e)^{4/3}(1-e)^{-3}. For a scattered\ndisk-like population (i.e., common pericentres), in the absence of dynamical\nevolution, the mass evolution at late times would be as if only planetesimals\nwith the largest eccentricity were present. Despite the increased remaining\nmass, higher eccentricities do not increase the hot emission from the\ncollisional cascade until e>0.99, partly because most collisions occur near\npericentre thus increasing the dust blow-out diameter. However, at high\neccentricities (e>0.97) the blow-out population extending out from pericentre\nmay be detectable above the collisional cascade; higher eccentricities also\nincrease the probability of witnessing a recent collision. All of the imaging\nand spectroscopic constraints for eta Corvi can be explained with a single\nplanetesimal population with pericentre at 0.75AU, apocentre at 150AU, and mass\n5M_\\oplus; however, the origin of such a high eccentricity population remains\nchallenging.

The planetary radius is evolved\nself-consistently with orbital parameters, under the influence of tidal torques\nand tidal dissipation in the interior of the planet. A general feature of this\nmodel, which we have previously demonstrated in the generic case, is that a\npossible transient inflation of the planetary radius can temporarily interrupt\nits standard monotonic shrinking and can lead to the inflated radii that we\nobserve. In particular, a bloated planet with even a circular orbit may still\nbe inflated due to an earlier episode of tidal heating.

They interact with their stars affecting their angular momentum.\nRecent observations provide suggestive evidence of excess angular momentum in\nstars with hot Jupiters in comparison to stars with distant and less massive\nplanets. This has been attributed to tidal interaction, but needs to be\ninvestigated in more detail considering also other possible explanations\nbecause in several cases the tidal synchronization time scales are much longer\nthan the ages of the stars. We select stars harbouring transiting hot Jupiters\nto study their rotation and find that those with an effective temperature\ngreater than 6000 K and a rotation period shorter than 10 days are synchronized\nwith the orbital motion of their planets or have a rotation period\napproximately twice that of the planetary orbital period. Stars with an\neffective temperature lower than 6000 K and a rotation period longer than 10\ndays show a general trend toward synchronization with increasing effective\ntemperature or decreasing orbital period. We propose a model for the angular\nmomentum evolution of stars with hot Jupiters to interpret these observations.\nIt is based on the hypothesis that a close-in giant planet affects the coronal\nfield of its host star leading to a topology with predominantly closed field\nlines. Our model can be tested observationally and has relevant consequences\nfor the relationship between stellar rotation and close-in giant planets as\nwell as for the application of gyrochronology to estimate the age of\nplanet-hosting stars. \n\n"}

The\ntransfer is effected by the galactic fountain -- cool clouds that are shot up\nfrom the plane to kiloparsec heights above the plane. The Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability strips gas from these clouds. If the pressure and the the\nmetallicity of the corona are high enough, the stripped gas causes a similar\nmass of coronal gas to condense in the cloud's wake. Hydrodynamical simulations\nof cloud-corona interaction are presented. These confirm the existence of a\ncritical ablation rate above which the corona is condensed, and imply that for\nthe likely parameters of the Galactic corona this rate lies near the actual\nablation rate of clouds. In external galaxies trails of HI behind individual\nclouds will not be detectable, although the integrated emission from all such\ntrails should be significant.

Previous numerical investigations of this problem\n(Lodato & Pringle 2007) did not find a good agreement between the numerical\nresults and the predictions of the analytic theories of warp propagation, both\nin the linear and in the non-linear case. Here, we take advantage of a new,\nlow-memory and highly efficient SPH code to run a large set of very high\nresolution simulations (up to 20 million SPH particles) of warp propagation,\nimplementing an isotropic disc viscosity in different ways, to investigate the\norigin of the discrepancy between the theory and the numerical results. Our new\nand improved analysis now shows a remarkable agreement with the analytic theory\nboth in the linear and in the non-linear regime, in terms of warp diffusion\ncoefficient and precession rate.

Our general formulation shows that the relative velocity has\ncontributions from two terms, referred to as the generalized acceleration and\ngeneralized shear terms, because they reduce to the well known acceleration and\nshear terms in the Saffman-Turner limit. The generalized shear term represents\nparticles' memory of the flow velocity difference along their trajectories and\ndepends on the inertial particle pair dispersion backward in time. The\nimportance of this backward dispersion in determining the particle relative\nvelocity is emphasized. We find that our model with a two-phase separation\nbehavior, an early ballistic phase and a later tracer-like phase, as found by\nrecent simulations for the forward (in time) dispersion of inertial particle\npairs, gives good fits to the measured relative speeds from simulations at low\nReynolds numbers. In the monodisperse case with identical particles, the\ngeneralized acceleration term vanishes and the relative velocity is determined\nby the generalized shear term. At large Reynolds numbers, our model gives a\n$St^{1/2}$ dependence of the relative velocity on the Stokes number $St$ in the\ninertial range for both the ballistic behavior and the Richardson separation\nlaw. This leads to the same inertial-range scaling for the two-phase separation\nthat well fits the simulation results. Our calculations for the bidisperse case\nshow that, with the friction timescale of one particle fixed, the relative\nspeed as a function of the other particle's friction time has a dip when the\ntwo timescales are similar. We find that the primary contribution at the dip is\nfrom the generalized shear term, while the generalized acceleration term is\ndominant for particles of very different sizes. \n\n"}

In this study, we use three-dimensional radiative hydrodynamics\nsimulations and model solids as a spatial distribution of particles. We assume\nthat half of the total solid fraction is in small grains and half in large\nsolids. The former are perfectly entrained with the gas and set the opacity in\nthe disk, while the latter are allowed to respond to gas drag forces, with the\nback reaction on the gas taken into account. To explore the maximum effects of\ngas-solid interactions, we first consider 10cm-size particles. We then compare\nthese results to a simulation with 1 km-size particles, which explores the\nlow-drag regime. We show that (1) disk instability planets have the potential\nto form large cores due to aerodynamic capturing of rock-size solids in spiral\narms before fragmentation; (2) that temporary clumps can concentrate tens of\n$M_{\\oplus}$ of solids in very localized regions before clump disruption; (3)\nthat the formation of permanent clumps, even in the outer disk, is dependent on\nthe grain-size distribution, i.e., the opacity; (4) that nonaxisymmetric\nstructure in the disk can create disk regions that have a solids-to-gas ratio\ngreater than unity; (5) that the solid distribution may affect the\nfragmentation process; (6) that proto-gas giants and proto-brown dwarfs can\nstart as differentiated objects prior to the H$_2$ collapse phase; (7) that\nspiral arms in a gravitationally unstable disk are able to stop the inward\ndrift of rock-size solids, even redistributing them to larger radii; and, (8)\nthat large solids can form spiral arms that are offset from the gaseous spiral\narms.

A higher rate of mass infall onto the disk\nthan that onto the star is a necessary but not sufficient condition for disk\nfragmentation.

We calibrate the model with the well-characterized\ntransiting planet, HD 189733b, then compute light curves for seven of the most\neccentric transiting planets. We present phase variations for a variety of\ndifferent radiative times and wind speeds. In the limit of instant\nre-radiation, the light curve morphology is entirely dictated by the planet's\neccentricity and argument of pericenter: the light curve maximum leads or\ntrails the eclipse depending on whether the planet is receding from or\napproaching the star at superior conjunction, respectively. For a planet with\nnon-zero radiative timescales, the phase peak occurs early for super- rotating\nwinds, and late for sub-rotating winds. We find that for a circular orbit, the\ntiming of the phase variation maximum with respect to superior conjunction\nindicates the direction of the dominant winds, but cannot break the degeneracy\nbetween wind speed and radiative time. For circular planets the phase minimum\noccurs half an orbit away from the phase maximum -despite the fact that the\ncoolest longitudes are always near the dawn terminator- and therefore does not\nconvey any additional information. In general, increasing the advective\nfrequency or the radiative time has the effect of reducing the peak-to-trough\namplitude of phase variations, but there are interesting exceptions to these\ntrends. Lastly, eccentric planets with orbital periods significantly longer\nthan their radiative time exhibit \"ringing\" whereby the hot spot generated at\nperiastron rotates in and out of view.

In gaseous and planetesimal disks, migration can remove planets as\nquickly as they form. To explore migration in a planetesimal disk, we combine\nanalytic and numerical approaches. After deriving general analytic migration\nrates for isolated planets, we use N-body simulations to confirm these results\nfor fast and slow migration modes.

AIMS. In this\ncontribution we highlight the importance to account for the orbital\neccentricity and longitude of periastron of the planetary orbit to accurately\ninterpret the measured planetary radial velocity during the transit. Methods:\nWe calculate the radial velocity of a transiting planet in an eccentric orbit.\nGiven the larger orbital speed of planets with respect to their stellar\ncompanions even small eccentricities can result in detectable blue or redshift\nradial velocity offsets during the transit with respect to the systemic\nvelocity, the exact value depending also on the longitude of the periastron of\nthe planetary orbit.

Conclusions: We\npropose an alternative interpretation of the recently claimed radial velocity\nblueshift (~2 km/s) of the planetary spectral lines of HD209458b which implies\nthat the orbit of this system is not exactly circular.

Statistical Analysis of the\n  First Four Months Abstract: The architectures of multiple planet systems can provide valuable constraints\non models of planet formation, including orbital migration, and excitation of\norbital eccentricities and inclinations. NASA's Kepler mission has identified\n1235 transiting planet candidates (Borcuki et al 2011). The method of transit\ntiming variations (TTVs) has already confirmed 7 planets in two planetary\nsystems (Holman et al. 2010; Lissauer et al. 2011a). We perform a transit\ntiming analysis of the Kepler planet candidates. We find that at least ~12% of\nplanet candidates currently suitable for TTV analysis show evidence suggestive\nof TTVs, representing at least ~65 TTV candidates. In all cases, the time span\nof observations must increase for TTVs to provide strong constraints on planet\nmasses and/or orbits, as expected based on n-body integrations of multiple\ntransiting planet candidate systems (assuming circular and coplanar orbits). We\nfind that the fraction of planet candidates showing TTVs in this data set does\nnot vary significantly with the number of transiting planet candidates per\nstar, suggesting significant mutual inclinations and that many stars with a\nsingle transiting planet should host additional non-transiting planets. We\nanticipate that Kepler could confirm (or reject) at least ~12 systems with\nmultiple transiting planet candidates via TTVs. Thus, TTVs will provide a\npowerful tool for confirming transiting planets and characterizing the orbital\ndynamics of low-mass planets. If Kepler observations were extended to at least\nsix years, then TTVs would provide much more precise constraints on the\ndynamics of systems with multiple transiting planets and would become sensitive\nto planets with orbital periods extending into the habitable zone of solar-type\nstars. \n\n"}

The emission line profiles show a\nrange of strengths and shapes, but can generally be classified into a broad,\nwarm component and a narrow, cool component. The broad CO emission is detected\nmore frequently from YSOs with bolometric luminosities of <15 Lsun than those\nwith >15 Lsun, and as with CO emission from CTTSs is attributed to the warm\n(~1000 K) inner AU of the disk.

Orbits with arbitrary inclination to the stellar\nrotation axis are considered. We obtain results both from an analytic treatment\nand numerical one that are in satisfactory agreement. These results are applied\nto the initial phase of the tidal circularisation problem. We find that both\ntides induced in the star and planet can lead to a significant decrease of the\norbital semi-major axis for orbits having periastron distances smaller than 5-6\nstellar radii (corresponding to periods $\\sim 4-5$ days after the\ncircularisation has been completed) with tides in the star being much stronger\nfor retrograde orbits compared to prograde orbits. We use the simple Skumanich\nlaw for the stellar rotation with its rotational period equal to one month at\nthe age of 5Gyr. The strength of tidal interactions is characterised by\ncircularisation time scale, $t_{ev}$ defined as a time scale of evolution of\nthe planet's semi-major axis due to tides considered as a function of orbital\nperiod $P_{obs}$ after the process of tidal circularisation has been completed.\nWe find that the ratio of the initial circularisation time scales corresponding\nto prograde and retrograde orbits is of order 1.5-2 for a planet of one Jupiter\nmass and $P_{obs}\\sim $ four days. It grows with the mass of the planet, being\nof order five for a five Jupiter mass planet with the same $P_{orb}$. Thus, the\neffect of stellar rotation may provide a bias in the formation of planetary\nsystems having planets on close orbits around their host stars, as a\nconsequence of planet-planet scattering, favouring systems with retrograde\norbits.

However, if the\ncosmological framework is extended to include also additional relativistic\ndegrees of freedom -- beyond the three standard neutrinos and the putative\nsterile neutrinos, then the hot dark matter constraint on the sterile states is\nconsiderably relaxed. A further improvement is achieved by allowing a dark\nenergy equation of state parameter w<-1. While BBN strongly disfavours extra\nradiation beyond the assumed eV-mass sterile neutrino, this constraint can be\ncircumvented by a small nu_e degeneracy. Any model containing eV-mass sterile\nneutrinos implies also strong modifications of other cosmological parameters.\nNotably, the inferred cold dark matter density can shift up by 20 to 75%\nrelative to the standard LambdaCDM value. \n\n"}

As such the scattering process can be considered as\na series of three body problems during each of which the Tisserand parameter\nwith respect to the relevant planet is conserved. This constrains the orbital\nparameter space into which a particle can be scattered. Such arguments have\npreviously been applied to the process by which comets are scattered to the\ninner Solar System from the Kuiper belt. Our analysis generalises this for an\narbitrary planetary system. For particles scattered from an outer belt directly\nalong a chain of planets, based on the initial value of the Tisserand\nparameter, we find that it is possible to (i) determine which planets can eject\nthe particles from the system, (ii) define a minimum stellar distance to which\nparticles can be scattered, and (iii) constrain range of particle inclinations\n(and hence the disc height) at different distances.

Theoretical studies encounter difficulties in\nexplaining their formation and origin. Here we propose a novel scenario for the\nproduction of planetary systems at such orbits, through the dynamical recapture\nof free floating planets (FFPs) in dispersing stellar clusters. This process is\na natural extension of the recently suggested scenario for the formation of\nwide stellar binaries. We use N-body simulations of dispersing clusters with\n10-1000 stars and comparable numbers of FFPs to study this process. We find\nthat planets are captured into wide orbits in the typical range ~100-10^6 AU,\nand have a wide range of eccentricities (thermal distribution). Typically, 3-6\nx (f_FFP/1) % of all stars capture a planetary companion with such properties\n(where f_FFP is the number of FFP per star). The planetary capture efficiency\nis comparable to that of capture-formed stellar-binaries, and shows a similar\ndependence on the cluster size and structure. It is almost independent of the\nspecific planetary mass; planets as well as sub-stellar companions of any mass\ncan be captured. The capture efficiency decreases with increasing cluster size,\nand for a given cluster size the it increases with the host/primary mass. More\nthan one planet can be captured around the same host and planets can be\ncaptured into binary systems. Planets can also be captured into pre-existing\nplanetary and into orbits around black holes and massive white dwarfs, if these\nformed early enough before the cluster dispersal. In particular, stellar black\nholes have a high capture efficiency (>50 % and 5-10 x (f_FFP/1) % for capture\nof stars and planetary companions, respectively) due to their large mass.\nFinally, although rare, two FFPs or brown dwarfs can become bound and form a\nFFP-binary system with no stellar host. \n\n"}

However, there is great uncertainty in how efficiently\nradiation couples to matter in these high optical depth environments. In\nparticular, it is unclear what levels of turbulence the radiation can produce,\nand whether the infrared radiation trapped by the dust opacity can give rise to\nheavily mass-loaded winds. In this paper we report a series of two-dimensional\nflux-limited diffusion radiation-hydrodynamics calculations performed with the\ncode ORION in which we drive strong radiation fluxes through columns of dusty\nmatter confined by gravity. We consider both systems where the radiation flux\nis sub-Eddington throughout the gas column, and where it is super-Eddington at\nthe midplane but sub-Eddington in the atmosphere. In the latter, we find that\nthe radiation-matter interaction gives rise to radiation-driven Rayleigh-Taylor\ninstability, which drives supersonic turbulence at a level sufficient to fully\nexplain the turbulence seen in Galactic protocluster gas clouds, and to make a\nnon-trivial contribution to the turbulence observed in starburst galaxy disks.\nHowever, the instability also produces a channel structure in which the\nradiation-matter interaction is reduced because the radiation field is not\nfully trapped. For astrophysical parameters relevant to forming star clusters\nand starburst galaxies, we find that this effect reduces the net momentum\ndeposition rate in the dusty gas by a factor of ~2-6 compared to simple\nanalytic estimates, and that in steady state the Eddington ratio reaches unity\nand there are no strong winds. We provide an approximation formula, appropriate\nfor implementation in analytic models and non-radiative simulations, for the\nforce exerted by the infrared radiation field in this regime. \n\n"}

In particular, we examine the resonance\nrelations that occur, by varying the physical and initial orbital parameters of\nthe planets (mass, initial semi-major axis and eccentricity) as well as the\nparameters of the migration forces (migration rate and eccentricity damping\nrate), which are modeled here through a simplified analytic prescription. We\nfind that, in general, for planetary masses below 1.5 M_J, multiple-planet\nresonances of the form n3:n2:n1=1:2:4 and 1:3:6 are established, as the inner\nplanets, m1 and m2, get trapped in a 1:2 resonance and the outer planet m3\nsubsequently is captured in a 1:2 or 1:3 resonance with m2. For mild\neccentricity damping, the resonance pumps the eccentricities of all planets on\na relatively short time-scale, to the point where they enter an\ninclination-type resonance (as in Libert & Tsiganis 2011); then mutual\ninclinations can grow to ~35{\\deg}, thus forming a \"3-D system\".

However, observations indicate that disc galaxies\ntypically have only about half as much specific angular momentum as their dark\nmatter haloes. We argue this does not necessarily imply that baryons lose this\nmuch specific angular momentum as they form galaxies. It may instead indicate\nthat galaxies are most directly related to the inner regions of their host\nhaloes, as may be expected in a scenario where baryons in the inner parts of\nhaloes collapse first. A limiting case is examined under the idealised\nassumption of perfect angular momentum conservation. Namely, we determine the\ndensity contrast Delta, with respect to the critical density of the Universe,\nby which dark matter haloes need to be defined in order to have the same\naverage specific angular momentum as the galaxies they host. Under the\nassumption that galaxies are related to haloes via their characteristic\nrotation velocities, the necessary Delta is ~600. This Delta corresponds to an\naverage halo radius and mass which are ~60% and ~75%, respectively, of the\nvirial values (i.e., for Delta = 200). We refer to this radius as the radius of\nbaryonic collapse R_BC, since if specific angular momentum is conserved\nperfectly, baryons would come from within it. It is not likely a simple step\nfunction due to the complex gastrophysics involved, therefore we regard it as\nan effective radius. In summary, the difference between the predicted initial\nand the observed final specific angular momentum of galaxies, which is\nconventionally attributed solely to angular momentum loss, can more naturally\nbe explained by a preference for collapse of baryons within R_BC, with possibly\nsome later angular momentum transfer. \n\n"}

In addition to the viscous\nheating, other heating to the corona is necessary to interpret HLAGN. In this\npaper, we assume that a part of accretion energy released in the disk is\ntransported into the corona, heating up the electrons and thereby radiated\naway. We for the first time, compute the corona structure with additional\nheating, taking fully into account the mass supply to the corona and find that\nthe corona could indeed survive at higher accretion rates and its radiation\npower increases.

We treat the red noise as a Gaussian random process with\nexponentially decaying correlation function.\n  Using this method we prove that: (i) planets b and c do exist in this system,\nsince they can be independently detected in the HARPS and Keck data, and\nregardless of the assumed noise models; (ii) planet e can also be confirmed\nindependently by the both datasets, although to reveal it in the Keck data it\nis mandatory to take the red noise into account; (iii) the recently announced\nputative planets f and g are likely just illusions of the red noise; (iv) the\nreality of the planet candidate GJ581 d is questionable, because it cannot be\ndetected from the Keck data, and its statistical significance in the HARPS data\n(as well as in the combined dataset) drops to a marginal level of $\\sim\n2\\sigma$, when the red noise is taken into account.\n  Therefore, the current data for GJ581 really support existence of no more\nthan four (or maybe even only three) orbiting exoplanets.

Here, the resonance angle of a planetary system\nexecutes libration (oscillatory motion) for several cycles, circulates for one\nor more cycles, and then enters once again into libration. This type of\ncomplicated dynamics can affect our interpretation of observed planetary\nsystems that are in or near mean motion resonance. This work shows that\nplanetary systems in (near) mean motion resonance can exhibit nodding behavior,\nand outlines the portion of parameter space where it occurs. This problem is\naddressed using both full numerical integrations of the planetary systems and\nvia model equations obtained through expansions of the disturbing function. In\nthe latter approach, we identify the relevant terms that allow for nodding. The\ntwo approaches are in agreement, and show that nodding often occurs when a\nsmall body is in an external mean motion resonance with a larger planet. As a\nresult, the nodding phenomenon can be important for interpreting observations\nof transit timing variations, where the existence of smaller bodies is inferred\nthrough their effects on larger, observed transiting planets. For example, in\nactively nodding planetary systems, both the amplitude and frequency of the\ntransit timing variations depend on the observational time window. \n\n"}
{"id": "1211.3119", "contents": "Title: A Model for (Non-Lognormal) Density Distributions in Isothermal\n  Turbulence Abstract: We propose a new, physically motivated fitting function for density PDFs in\nturbulent gas. Although it is known that when gas is isothermal, the PDF is\napproximately lognormal in the core, high-resolution simulations show large\ndeviations from exact log-normality. The proposed function provides an\nextraordinarily accurate description of the density PDFs in simulations with\nMach numbers ~0.1-15 and dispersion in log(rho) from ~0.01-4 dex. Compared to a\nlognormal or lognormal-skew-kurtosis model, the fits are improved by orders of\nmagnitude in the wings of the distribution (with fewer free parameters). This\nis true in simulations using distinct numerical methods, including or excluding\nmagnetic fields. Deviations from lognormality are represented by a parameter T\nthat increases with the compressive Mach number. The proposed distribution can\nbe derived from intermittent cascade models of the longitudinal (compressive)\nvelocity differences, which should be directly related to density fluctuations,\nand we provide a simple interpretation of the density PDF as the product of a\ncontinuous-time relaxation process. As such the parameter T is consistent with\nthe same parameter needed to explain the (intermittent) velocity structure\nfunctions; its behavior is consistent with turbulence becoming more\nintermittent as it becomes more dominated by strong shocks. It provides a new\nand unique probe of the role of intermittency in the density (not just\nvelocity) structure of turbulence. We show that this naturally explains some\napparent contradictory results in the literature based on use of different\nmoments of the density PDF, as well as differences based on whether\nvolume-weighted or mass-weighted quantities are measured. We show how these are\nfundamentally related to the fact that mass conservation requires violations of\nlog-normal statistics. \n\n"}

The influence of the bulge mass on the stellar orbits\nin the inner regions of a disk is also investigated. The new description offers\nthe advantage of easy control of the parameters of the Gaussian profile of its\npotential. We find a range of values for the perturbation amplitude from 400 to\n800 km^2 s^{-2} kpc^{-1} which implies a maximum ratio of the tangential force\nto the axisymmetric force between 3% and 6%, approximately. Good\nself-consistency of arm shapes is obtained between the Inner Lindblad resonance\n(ILR) and the 4:1 resonance. Near the 4:1 resonance the response density starts\nto deviate from the imposed logarithmic spiral form. This creates bifurcations\nthat appear as short arms. Therefore the deviation from a perfect logarithmic\nspiral in galaxies can be understood as a natural effect of the 4:1 resonance.\nBeyond the 4:1 resonance we find closed orbits which have similarities with the\narms observed in our Galaxy. In regions near the center, in the presence of a\nmassive bulge, elongated stellar orbits appear naturally, without imposing any\nbar-shaped potential, but only extending the spiral perturbation a little\ninward of the ILR. This suggests that a bar is formed with a half-size around 3\nkpc by a mechanism similar to that of the spiral arms. The potential energy\nperturbation that we adopted represents an important step in the direction of\nself-consistency, compared to previous sine function descriptions of the\npotential.

The clumps show, for the first time in a \"dense\ngas tracer\", a significant correlation between HCO+ line emission from cold\nmolecular gas and Br{\\gamma} line emission of associated nebulae. This\ncorrelation arises in the HCO+ line's brightness, not its linewidth. In\ncontrast, the correlation between the N2H+ line emission and Br{\\gamma} is weak\nor absent. The HCO+/N2H+ line ratio also varies widely from clump to clump:\nbright HCO+ emission tends to be more closely associated with Br{\\gamma}\nnebulosity, while bright N2H+ emission tends to avoid areas that are bright in\nBr{\\gamma}. Both molecular species show correlations of weak significance with\ninfrared H2 v=1-0 and v=2-1 line emission, in or near the clumps. The H2\nemission line ratio is consistent with fluorescent excitation in most of the\nclumps, although thermal excitation is seen in a few clumps.

A recent work by Makarov (2012) has demonstrated that\ntrapping into this resonance is certain if the eccentricity is larger than 0.2,\nprovided that we use a realistic tidal model, the one which is based on the\nDarwin-Kaula expansion of the tidal torque. The physics-based tidal model\nchanges dramatically the statistics of the possible final spin states. First,\nwe discover that after only one encounter with the spin-orbit 3:2 resonance\nthis resonance becomes the most probable end-state. Second, if a capture into\nthis (or any other) resonance takes place, the capture becomes final, several\ncrossings of the same state being forbidden by our model. Third, within our\nmodel the trapping of Mercury happens much faster than previously believed: for\nmost histories, 10 - 20 Myr are sufficient. Fourth, even a weak laminar\nfriction between the solid mantle and a molten core would most likely result in\na capture in the 2:1 or even higher resonance. So the principal novelty of our\npaper is that the 3:2 end-state is more ancient than the same end-state\nobtained when the constant time lag model is employed. The swift capture\njustifies our treatment of Mercury as a homogeneous, unstratified body whose\nliquid core had not yet formed by the time of trapping. We also provide a\ncritical analysis of the hypothesis by Wieczorek et al. (2012) that the early\nMercury might had been retrograde, whereafter it synchronised its spin and then\naccelerated it to the 3:2 resonance. Accurate processing of the available data\non cratering does not support that hypothesis, while the employment of a\nrealistic rheology invalidates a key element of the hypothesis, an intermediate\npseudosynchronous state needed to spin-up to the 3:2 resonance. \n\n"}

Gravitational perturbations from the companion are expected\nto excite high planetesimal eccentricities resulting in destruction, rather\nthan growth, of objects with sizes of up to several hundred km in collisions of\nsimilar-size bodies. It was recently suggested that gravity of a massive\naxisymmetric gaseous disk in which planetesimals are embedded drives rapid\nprecession of their orbits, suppressing eccentricity excitation. However, disks\nin binaries are themselves expected to be eccentric, leading to additional\nplanetesimal excitation. Here we develop secular theory of eccentricity\nevolution for planetesimals perturbed by the gravity of an elliptical\nprotoplanetary disk (neglecting gas drag) and the companion. For the first time\nwe derive an expression for the disturbing function due to an eccentric disk,\nwhich can be used for a variety of other astrophysical problems. We obtain\nexplicit analytical solutions for planetesimal eccentricity evolution and\ndelineate four different regimes of dynamical excitation. We show that in\nsystems with massive (>10^{-2}M_Sun) disks, planetesimal eccentricity is\nusually determined by the gravity of the eccentric disk alone, and is\ncomparable to the disk eccentricity. As a result, the latter imposes a lower\nlimit on collisional velocities of solids, making their growth problematic.\nThis fragmentation barrier can be removed if the gaseous disk rapidly precesses\nor if its own self-gravity is efficient at lowering disk eccentricity. \n\n"}

Strong pressure-broadened Na and K absorption signatures are also\nexcluded, as are significant metal-hydride features. We compare our combined\nbroadband spectrum to a wide variety of existing aerosol-free atmospheric\nmodels, though none are satisfactory fits. However, we do find that the full\ntransmission spectrum can be described by models which include significant\nopacity from aerosols: including Rayleigh scattering, Mie scattering, tholin\nhaze, and settling dust profiles. The transmission spectrum follows an\neffective extinction cross section with a power-law of index alpha, with the\nslope of the transmission spectrum constraining the quantity alphaT =\n-3528+/-660 K, where T is the atmospheric temperature. Rayleigh scattering\n(alpha=-4) is among the best fitting models, though requires low terminator\ntemperatures near 900 K. Sub-micron size aerosol particles can provide equally\ngood fits to the entire transmission spectrum for a wide range of temperatures,\nand we explore corundum as a plausible dust aerosol.

High-contrast direct imaging of circumstellar disks is\nlimited by quasi-static speckle noise and ADI is commonly used to suppress\nthose speckles. However, the application of ADI can result in self-subtraction\nof the disk signal due to the disk's finite spatial extent.

To compensate for this\nattenuation, we forward-model the disk structure and compute the form of the\nself-subtraction function at each separation.

Observationally, the number of small-radius, transiting\nplanets with accompanying mass measurements is insufficient for a robust\ndetermination of the transitional mass or radius. Theoretically, models predict\nthat rocky planets can grow large enough to become gas giants when they reach\n~10 Earth-masses, but the transitional mass remains unknown. Here I show how\ntransit data, interpreted in the context of tidal theory, can reveal the\ncritical radius that separates rocky and gaseous exoplanets. Standard tidal\nmodels predict that rocky exoplanets' orbits are tidally circularized much more\nrapidly than gaseous bodies', suggesting the former will tend to be found on\ncircular orbits at larger semi-major axes than the latter. Well-sampled\ntransits can provide a minimum eccentricity of the orbit, allowing a\nmeasurement of this differential circularization. I show that this effect\nshould be present in the data from the Kepler spacecraft, but is not apparent.\nInstead, it appears that there is no evidence of tidal circularization at any\nplanetary radius, probably because the publicly-available data, particularly\nthe impact parameters, are not accurate enough. I also review the bias in the\ntransit duration toward values that are smaller than that of planets on\ncircular orbits, stressing that the azimuthal velocity of the planet determines\nthe transit duration. The ensemble of Kepler planet candidates may be able to\ndetermine the critical radius between rocky and gaseous exoplanets, tidal\ndissipation as a function of planetary radius, and discriminate between tidal\nmodels. \n\n"}

Here we explore the second way using global, three-dimensional isothermal\nhydrodynamical simulations with 8 levels of nested grids around the planet.

Our survey complements the larger\nHerschel GASPS program \"Gas in Protoplanetary Systems\" (Dent et al. 2013) by\nquadrupling the number of transitional disks observed with PACS at this\nwavelength. [OI] 63 micron traces material in the outer regions of the disk,\nbeyond the inner cavity of most transitional disks. We find that transitional\ndisks have [OI] 63 micron line luminosities two times fainter than their full\ndisk counterparts. We self consistently determine various stellar properties\n(e.g. bolometric luminosity, FUV excess, etc.) and disk properties (e.g. disk\ndust mass, etc.) that could influence the [OI] 63 micron line luminosity and we\nfind no correlations that can explain the lower [OI] 63 micron line\nluminosities in transitional disks. Using a grid of thermo-chemical\nprotoplanetary disk models, we conclude that either transitional disks are less\nflared than full disks or they possess lower gas-to-dust ratios due to a\ndepletion of gas mass.

Assuming H2O (inner HZ) and CO2 (outer HZ) dominated atmospheres, and\nscaling the background N2 atmospheric pressure with the radius of the planet,\nour results indicate that larger planets have wider HZs than do smaller ones.\nSpecifically, with the assumption that smaller planets will have less dense\natmospheres, the inner edge of the HZ (runaway greenhouse limit) moves outward\n(~10% lower than Earth flux) for low mass planets due to larger greenhouse\neffect arising from the increased H2O column depth. For larger planets, the H2O\ncolumn depth is smaller, and higher temperatures are needed before water vapor\ncompletely dominates the outgoing longwave radiation. Hence the inner edge\nmoves inward (7% higher than Earth's flux). The outer HZ changes little due to\nthe competing effects of the greenhouse effect and an increase in albedo. New,\n3-D climate model results from other groups are also summarized, and we argue\nthat further, independent studies are needed to verify their predictions.\nCombined with our previous work, the results presented here provide refined\nestimates of HZs around main-sequence stars and provide a step towards a more\ncomprehensive analysis of HZs. \n\n"}

The standard solar model fails to predict the very low lithium\nabundance in the Sun, which is much lower than the proto-solar nebula. This Li\nproblem has been debated for decades, and it has been ascribed either to planet\nformation or to secular stellar depletion. In order to test the evolution of\nLi, it is important to find solar twins in a range of ages. Also, the study of\nstars similar to the Sun is relevant in relation to the signature of\nterrestrial planet formation around the Sun. [Methods]. We acquired\nhigh-resolution (R=110,000), high S/N (~300) ESO/VLT UVES spectra of several\nsolar twin candidates and the Sun (as reflected from the asteroid Juno). Among\nthe solar twin candidates we identify HIP 114328 as a solar twin and perform a\ndifferential line-by-line abundance analysis of this star relative to the Sun.\n[Results]. HIP 114328 has stellar parameters Teff = 5785+/-10 K, log g =\n4.38+/-0.03, [Fe/H] = -0.022+/-0.009, and a microturbulent velocity 0.05+/-0.03\nkm/s higher than solar. The differential analysis shows that this star is\nchemically very similar to the Sun. The refractory elements seem even slightly\nmore depleted than in the Sun, meaning that HIP 114328 may be as likely to form\nterrestrial planets as the Sun. HIP 114328 is about 2 Gyr older than the Sun,\nand is thus the second oldest solar twin analyzed at high precision. It has a\nLi abundance of A(Li)NLTE <= 0.46, which is about 4 times lower than in the Sun\n(A(Li)NLTE = 1.07 dex), but close to the oldest solar twin known, HIP 102152.\n[Conclusions]. Based on the lower abundances of refractory elements when\ncompared to other solar twins, HIP 114328 seems an excellent candidate to host\nrocky planets. The low Li abundance of this star is consistent with its old age\nand fits very well the emerging Li-age relation among solar twins of different\nages. \n\n"}

Here we examined the possibility that Iapetus's\ninclination was excited during the early solar system instability when\nencounters between Saturn and ice giants occurred. We found that the dynamical\neffects of planetary encounters on Iapetus's orbit sensitively depend on the\ndistance of the few closest encounters. In four out of ten instability cases\nstudied here, the orbital perturbations were too large to be plausible. In one\ncase, Iapetus's orbit was practically unneffected. In the remaining five cases,\nthe perturbations of Iapetus's inclination were adequate to explain its present\nvalue. In three of these cases, however, Iapetus's eccentricity was excited to\n0.1-0.25, and it is not clear whether it could have been damped to its present\nvalue (0.03) by some subsequent process (e.g., tides and dynamical friction\nfrom captured irregular satellites do not seem to be strong enough).

Three simple models of dust emission were fit to the\nobservations: a single temperature blackbody modified by a power- law\nemissivity (SMBB), a single temperature blackbody modified by a broken\npower-law emissivity (BEMBB), and two blackbodies with different temperatures,\nboth modified by the same power-law emissivity (TTMBB). Using these models we\ninvestigate the origin of the submm excess; defined as the submillimeter\n(submm) emission above that expected from SMBB models fit to observations < 200\nmicron.

One means of\ngaining such information is that of asteroseismology. By a forward modeling\napproach we analyze in a qualitative manner the impact of different\ndifferential rotation profiles on the splittings of p-mode oscillation\nfrequencies. The optimum modes for inference on differential rotation are\nidentified along with the best value of the stellar inclination angle. We find\nthat in general it is not likely that asteroseismology can be used to make an\nunambiguous distinction between a rotation profile such as, e.g., a conical\nSun-like profile and a cylindrical profile. In addition, it seems unlikely that\nasteroseismology of Sun-like stars will result in inferences on the radial\nprofile of the differential rotation, such as can be done for, e.g., red\ngiants. At best one could possibly obtain the sign of the radial differential\nrotation gradient. Measurements of the extent of the latitudinal differential\nfrom frequency splitting are, however, more promising. One very interesting\naspect that could likely be tested from frequency splittings is whether the\ndifferential rotation is solar-like or anti-solar-like in nature, in the sense\nthat a solar-like profile has an equator rotating faster than the poles. \n\n"}

The scaling symmetry of the SP equation and\nthe uncertainty principle tightly relate the core mass to the halo specific\nenergy, which, in the context of cosmological structure formation, leads to a\nsimple scaling between core mass ($M_c$) and halo mass ($M_h$), $M_c \\propto\na^{-1/2} M_h^{1/3}$, where $a$ is the cosmic scale factor.

With the two\nsuccessive period ratios both near and slightly larger than 2, the system may\nhave evolved from pairwise 2:1 mean motion resonances (MMRs). In this paper, we\ninvestigate the evolutions of the period ratios of the three planets after the\nprimordial gas disk was depleted. Three routines are found to probably result\nin the current configuration under tidal dissipation with the center star, they\nare: (i) through apsidal alignment only; (ii) out of pairwise 2:1 MMRs, then\nthrough apsidal alignment; (iii) out of the 4:2:1 Laplace Resonance (LR) , then\nthrough apsidal alignment. All the three scenarios require the initial\neccentricities of planets $\\sim0.15$, which implies a planetary scattering\nhistory during and after the gas disk was depleted. All the three routines will\ngo through the apsidal alignment phase, and enter a state with near-zero\neccentricities finally. We also find some special characteristics for each\nroutine.

In previous work using the Spitzer\nSpace Telescope, we found evidence to support at least one sub-Earth-sized\nexoplanet orbiting the nearby mid-M dwarf star GJ 436. As a follow up, here we\nused the Hubble Space Telescope to investigate the existence of one of these\ncandidate planets, UCF-1.01, by searching for two transit signals as it passed\nin front of its host star. Interpretation of the data hinges critically on\ncorrectly modeling and removing the WFC3 instrument systematics from the light\ncurves. Building on previous HST work, we demonstrate that WFC3 analyses need\nto explore the use of a quadratic function to fit a visit-long time-dependent\nsystematic. This is important for establishing absolute transit and eclipse\ndepths in the white light curves of all transiting systems. The work presented\nhere exemplifies this point by putatively detecting the primary transit of\nUCF-1.01 with the use of a linear trend. However, using a quadratic trend, we\nachieve a better fit to the white light curves and a reduced transit depth that\nis inconsistent with previous Spitzer measurements.

Using extant WFC3 transit light curves for GJ436b, we further\nvalidate the quadratic model component by achieving photon-limited model fit\nresiduals and consistent transit depths over multiple epochs. We conclude that,\nwhen we fit for a quadratic trend, our new data contradict the prediction of a\nsub-Earth-sized planet orbiting GJ 436 with the size, period, and ephemeris\nposited from the Spitzer data by a margin of 3.1{\\sigma}. \n\n"}

These\nsources are easy to identify since the angular separation of their lobes\nremains almost constant at some tens of arcseconds for z>1. Using a simple\nalgorithm applied to the FIRST survey, we obtain the largest FRII sample to\ndate, containing over ten thousand double-lobed sources. A subset of 459\nsources is matched to SDSS quasars. This sample yields a statistically\nmeaningful description of the fraction of quasars with lobes as a function of\nredshift and luminosity. This relation is combined with the bolometric quasar\nluminosity function, as derived from surveys at IR to hard X-ray frequencies,\nand a disc-lobe correlation to obtain a robust prediction for the density of\nFRIIs on the radio sky. We find that the observed density can be explained by\nthe population of known quasars, implying that the majority of powerful jets\noriginate from a radiatively efficient accretion flow with a linear jet-disc\ncoupling.

In this study, we\ncalculate mass flux of the outward motion of compact grains and porous dust\naggregates by the radiation pressure. The radiation pressure force for porous\ndust aggregates is calculated using the T-Matrix Method for the Clusters of\nSpheres.

Turbulence within cores results in a spatially\nnon-uniform angular momentum of the cloud, causing a stochastic variation in\norientation of the disk forming from the collapsing material. In the absence of\nstar-disk angular momentum coupling, such disk-tilting would provide a natural\nmechanism for production of primordial spin-orbit misalignments in the\nresulting planetary systems. However, owing to high accretion rates in the\nembedded phase of star formation, the inner edge of the circumstellar disk\nextends down to the stellar surface, resulting in efficient gravitational and\naccretional angular momentum transfer between the star and the disk. Here, we\ndemonstrate that the resulting gravitational coupling is sufficient to suppress\nany significant star-disk misalignment, with accretion playing a secondary\nrole. The joint tilting of the star-disk system leads to a stochastic wandering\nof star-aligned bipolar outflows. Such wandering widens the effective opening\nangle of stellar outflows, allowing for more efficient clearing of the\nremainder of the protostar's gaseous envelope.

We investigate the occurrence rate of substellar\ncompanions around giant stars as a function of stellar mass and metallicity. We\nprobe the stellar mass range from about 1 to beyond 3 M_Sun, which is not being\nexplored by main-sequence samples. We fit the giant planet occurrence rate as a\nfunction of stellar mass and metallicity with a Gaussian and an exponential\ndistribution, respectively. We find strong evidence for a planet-metallicity\ncorrelation among the secure planet hosts of our giant star sample, in\nagreement with the one for main-sequence stars. However, the planet-metallicity\ncorrelation is absent for our sample of planet candidates, raising the\nsuspicion that a good fraction of them might indeed not be planets. Consistent\nwith the results obtained by Johnson for subgiants, the giant planet occurrence\nrate increases in the stellar mass interval from 1 to 1.9 M_Sun.

First, the problem is modeled with an idealized 3D general\ncirculation model (GCM) with gray gas radiative transfer. It is shown that over\na wide range of parameters the atmospheric boundary layer, rather than the\nlarge-scale circulation, is the key to understanding the planetary energy\nbalance.

We measure the density of BHB stars and the ratio of\nBHB to red giant branch stars in each field using identical techniques to our\nprevious work. We find excellent agreement with our previous measurement of a\npower-law for the 2-D projected surface density with an index of\n2.6$^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$ outside of 3 kpc, which flattens to $\\alpha <$1.2 inside of\n3 kpc. Our findings confirm our previous suggestion that the field BHB stars in\nM31 are part of the halo population. However, the total halo profile is now\nknown to differ from this BHB profile, which suggests that we have isolated the\nmetal-poor component. This component appears to have an unbroken power-law\nprofile from 3-150 kpc but accounts for only about half of the total halo\nstellar mass. Discrepancies between the BHB density profile and other\nmeasurements of the inner halo are therefore likely due to the different\nprofile of the metal-rich halo component, which is not only steeper than the\nprofile of the met al-poor component, but also has a larger core radius. These\nprofile differences also help to explain the large ratio of BHB/RGB stars in\nour observations. \n\n"}

It is caused by sunlight; when these bodies heat up in the Sun, they\neventually re-radiate the energy away in the thermal waveband, which in turn\ncreates a tiny thrust. This recoil acceleration is much weaker than solar and\nplanetary gravitational forces, but it can produce measurable orbital changes\nover decades and substantial orbital effects over millions to billions of\nyears. The same physical phenomenon also creates a thermal torque that,\ncomplemented by a torque produced by scattered sunlight, can modify the\nrotation rates and obliquities of small bodies as well. This rotational variant\nhas been coined the Yarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack (YORP) effect.

These bodies have a resonant\nrotation. Most of the natural satellites rotate synchronously, showing the same\nhemisphere to their parent planet (1:1 spin-orbit resonance). The case of\nMercury is unique since its spin rate is exactly 1.5 its mean motion (3:2\nspin-orbit resonance). These two configurations are dynamical equilibria,\nreached after damping of the initial rotation of the relevant bodies. Thus, the\nrotation quantities are a signature of the interior, in particular of a\nputative global ocean. This manuscript divides into 3 parts. The first part is\ndevoted to the synchronous resonance. It presents different models of rotation\nfrom a fully rigid body to a one with a global subsurfacic ocean.

However, comparing the predictions of planet-disk\ninteraction models to the observed features has shown far from perfect\nagreement. This may be due to the strong approximations used for the\npredictions. For example, spiral arm fitting typically uses results that are\nbased on low-mass planets in an isothermal gas. In this work, we describe\ntwo-dimensional, global, hydrodynamical simulations of disks with embedded\nprotoplanets, with and without the assumption of local isothermality, for a\nrange of planet-to-star mass ratios 1-10 M_jup for a 1 M_sun star.

To use observational resources most\nefficiently we need to know where the largest, most easily detected moons can\nform. We explore the possibility of large exomoons by following the movement of\nwater (H2O) ice lines in the accretion disks around young super-Jovian planets.\nWe want to know how different heating sources in those disks affect the H2O ice\nlines. We simulate 2D rotationally symmetric accretion disks in hydrostatic\nequilibrium around super-Jovian exoplanets. The energy terms in our\nsemi-analytical model -- (1) viscous heating, (2) planetary illumination, (3)\naccretional heating, and (4) stellar illumination -- are fed by precomputed\nplanet evolution tracks. We consider planets accreting 1 to 12 Jupiter masses\nat distances between 1 and 20 AU to a Sun-like star. Accretion disks around\nJupiter-mass planets closer than ~4.5 AU to Sun-like stars do not feature H2O\nice lines, but the most massive super-Jovians can form icy satellites as close\nas ~3 AU to Sun-like stars.

Rapid radiative\ncooling reduces the effective buoyancy and allows the VSI to operate.

Its location is determined by the properties of the star, the mass\naccretion rate through the disk, and the size distribution of dust suspended in\nthe disk. We calculate the snow line location from recent observations of mass\naccretion rates and as a function of stellar mass. By taking the observed\ndispersion in mass accretion rates as a measure of the dispersion in initial\ndisk mass, we find that stars of a given mass will exhibit a range of snow line\nlocations. At a given age and stellar mass, the observed dispersion in mass\naccretion rates of 0.4 dex naturally leads to a dispersion in snow line\nlocations of 0.2 dex. For ISM-like dust sizes, the one-sigma snow line location\namong solar mass stars of the same age ranges from 2 to 5 au. For more\nrealistic dust opacities that include larger grains, the snow line is located\nup to two times closer to the star. We use these locations and the outcome of\nN-body simulations to predict the amount of water delivered to terrestrial\nplanets that formed in situ in the habitable zone. We find that the dispersion\nin snow line locations leads to a large range in water content. For ISM-like\ndust sizes, a significant fraction of habitable-zone terrestrial planets around\nsun-like stars remain dry, and no water is delivered to the habitable zones of\nlow-mass M stars (less than half a solar mass) as in previous works. The\ncloser-in snow line in disks with larger grains enables water delivery to the\nhabitable zone for a significant fraction of M stars and all FGK stars.\nConsidering their larger numbers and higher planet occurrence, M stars may host\nmost of the water-rich terrestrial planets in the galaxy if these planets are\nable to hold on to their water in their subsequent evolution. \n\n"}

The lifetime\nof a magma ocean and its spectra through a steam atmosphere depends on the\norbital distance of the planet from the host star. For a type-I planet, which\nis formed beyond a certain critical distance from the host star, the thermal\nemission declines on a timescale shorter than approximately $10^6$ years.\nTherefore, young stars should be targets when searching for molten planets in\nthis orbital region. In contrast, a type-II planet, which is formed inside the\ncritical distance, will emit significant thermal radiation from near-infrared\natmospheric windows during the entire lifetime of the magma ocean. The Ks and L\nbands will be favorable for future direct imaging because the planet-to-star\ncontrasts of these bands are higher than approximately 10$^{-7}$-10$^{-8}$. Our\nmodel predicts that, in the type-II orbital region, molten planets would be\npresent over the main sequence of the G-type host star if the initial bulk\ncontent of water exceeds approximately 1 wt%. In visible atmospheric windows,\nthe contrasts of the thermal emission drop below $10^{-10}$ in less than $10^5$\nyears, whereas those of the reflected light remain $10^{-10}$ for both types of\nplanets. Since the contrast level is comparable to those of reflected light\nfrom Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone, the visible reflected light\nfrom molten planets also provides a promising target for direct imaging with\nfuture ground- and space-based telescopes. \n\n"}

Previous work indicates\nthat large values of $Q$ lead to galaxies so dense that planetary orbits cannot\nsurvive long enough for life to develop. Small values of $Q$ lead to delayed\nstar formation, loosely bound galaxies, and compromised heavy element\nretention. This work generalizes previous treatments: [A] We consider models\nfor the internal structure of galaxies and find the fraction of galactic real\nestate that allows stable, long-lived planetary orbits. [B] We perform a large\nensemble of numerical simulations to estimate cross sections for the disruption\nof planetary orbits due to interactions with passing stars.

[D]\nOne consequence of intense galactic background radiation fields is that some\nportion of the galaxy, denoted as the Galactic Habitable Zone, will provide the\nright flux levels to support habitable planets for essentially any planetary\norbit. As $Q$ increases, the fraction of stars in a galaxy that allow for\nhabitable planets decreases due to both orbital disruption and the intense\nbackground radiation. However, the outer parts of the galaxy always allow for\nhabitable planets, so that the value of $Q$ does not have a well-defined upper\nlimit. Moreover, some Galactic Habitable Zones are large enough to support more\npotentially habitable planets than the galaxies found in our universe.

Using high-resolution HST/COS and VLT spectroscopy, we\nhave detected hydrogen and eleven metals in the atmosphere of the white dwarf.\nThe origin of these metals is almost certainly the circumstellar disc of dusty\nand gaseous debris from a tidally-disrupted planetesimal, accreting at a rate\nof 1.6E10 gs^-1.

The\nmass of metals within the convection zone of the white dwarf corresponds to an\nasteroid of at least ~130-170 km in diameter, although the presence of ongoing\naccretion from the debris disc implies that the planetesimal was probably\nlarger than this.

We have recently identified a spiral\ninstability in the post-merger phase of DD mergers and demonstrated that this\ninstability self-consistently leads to detonation in some cases.

Here, we utilize the SuperNu radiative transfer\nsoftware to calculate three-dimensional synthetic light curves and spectra of\nthe spiral merger simulation with a system mass of 2.1 $M_\\odot$ from Kashyap\net al. Because of their large system masses, both violent and spiral merger\nlight curves are slowly declining. The spiral merger resembles very slowly\ndeclining SNe Ia, including SN 2001ay, and provides a more natural explanation\nfor its observed properties than other SN Ia explosion models.

Because the ISM is turbulent, a given\npatch of ISM exhibits sub-patches with a range of surface densities. The\nhigh-density patches are 'pushed' by feedback, thereby driving turbulence and\nself-regulating local star formation. Sufficiently low-density patches,\nhowever, are accelerated to above the escape velocity before the region can\nself-adjust and are thus vented as outflows. In the\nturbulent-pressure-supported regime, when the gas fraction is $\\gtrsim 0.3$,\nthe ratio of the turbulent velocity dispersion to the circular velocity is\nsufficiently high that at any given time, of order half of the ISM has surface\ndensity less than the critical value and thus can be blown out on a dynamical\ntime. The resulting outflows have a mass-loading factor ($\\eta \\equiv M_{\\rm\nout}/M_{\\star}$) that is inversely proportional to the gas fraction times the\ncircular velocity. At low gas fractions, the star formation rate needed for\nlocal self-regulation, and corresponding turbulent Mach number, decline\nrapidly; the ISM is 'smoother', and it is actually more difficult to drive\nwinds with large mass-loading factors.

This sample provides a collection of close-packed\nplanetary systems with relatively little spread in the inclination angles of\nthe inferred orbits. A large fraction of the observational sample contains\nlimited multiplicity, begging the question whether there is a true diversity of\nmulti transiting systems, or if some systems merely possess high mutual\ninclinations, allowing them to appear as single-transiting systems in a\ntransit-based survey. This paper begins an exploration of the effectiveness of\ndynamical mechanisms in exciting orbital inclination within exoplanetary\nsystems of this class. For these tightly packed systems, we determine that the\norbital inclination angles are not spread out appreciably through\nself-excitation. In contrast, the two Kepler multi-planet systems with\nadditional non-transiting planets are susceptible to oscillations of their\ninclination angles, which means their currently observed configurations could\nbe due to planet-planet interactions alone. We also provide constraints and\npredictions for the expected transit duration variations (TDVs) for each\nplanet. In these multi-planet compact Kepler systems, oscillations of their\ninclination angles are remarkably hard to excite; as a result, they tend to\nremain continually mutually transiting (CMT-stable). We study this issue\nfurther by augmenting the planet masses and determining the enhancement factor\nrequired for oscillations to move the systems out of transit. The oscillations\nof inclination found here inform the recently suggested dichotomy in the sample\nof solar systems observed by Kepler. \n\n"}

Motivation, methodology\n  and first results from SALT Abstract: The black holes (BH) in merging BH-BH binaries are likely progeny of binary O\nstars. Their properties, including their spins, will be strongly influenced by\nthe evolution of their progenitor O stars. The remarkable observation that many\nsingle O stars spin very rapidly can be explained if they accreted angular\nmomentum from a mass-transferring, O-type or Wolf-Rayet companion before that\nstar blew up as a supernova. To test this prediction, we have measured the spin\nrates of eight O stars in Wolf-Rayet (WR) + O binaries, increasing the total\nsample size of such O stars' measured spins from two to ten. Polarimetric and\nother determinations of these systems' sin i allow us to determine an average\nequatorial rotation velocity from HeI (HeII) lines of $v_e$ = 348 (173) km/s\nfor these O stars, with individual star's $v_e$ from HeI (HeII) lines ranging\nfrom 482 (237) to 290 (91) km/s. We argue that the $\\sim$ 100\\% difference\nbetween HeI and HeII speeds is due to gravity darkening. Super-synchronous\nspins, now observed in all 10 O stars in WR + O binaries where it has been\nmeasured, are strong observational evidence that Roche lobe overflow mass\ntransfer from a WR progenitor companion has played a critical role in the\nevolution of WR+OB binaries. While theory predicts that this mass transfer\nrapidly spins-up the O-type mass gainer to a nearly break-up rotational\nvelocity $v_e \\sim 530 $ km/s, the observed average $v_e$ of the O-type stars\nin our sample is 65\\% that speed. This demonstrates that, even over the\nrelatively short WR-phase timescale, tidal and/or other effects causing\nrotational spin-down must be efficient. A challenge to tidal synchronization\ntheory is that the two longest-period binaries in our sample (with periods of\n29.7 and 78.5 days) unexpectedly display super-synchronous rotation. \n\n"}

This concept, called as\ndensified pupil spectroscopy, allows us to perform high, stable\nspectrophotometry against telescope pointing jitter and deformation of the\nprimary mirror. This densified pupil spectrometer comprises the following three\nroles: division of a pupil into a number of sub-pupils, densification of each\nsub-pupil, and acquisition of the spectrum of each sub-pupil with a\nconventional spectrometer. Focusing on the fact that the divided and densified\nsub-pupil can be treated as a point source, we discovered that a simplified\nspectrometer allows us to acquire the spectra of the densified sub-pupils on\nthe detector plane-an optical conjugate with the primary mirror-by putting the\ndivided and densified sub-pupils on the entrance slit of the spectrometer. The\nacquired multiple spectra are not principally moved on the detector against\nlow-order aberrations such as the telescope pointing jitter and any deformation\nof the primary mirror.

Such stellar noise is poorly understood\nfor stars other than the Sun because their surface is unresolved. In\nparticular, the effects of stellar surface inhomogeneities on observed stellar\nradial velocities are extremely difficult to characterize, and thus developing\noptimal correction techniques to extract true stellar radial velocities is\nextremely challenging. In this paper, we present preliminary results of a solar\ntelescope built to feed full-disk sunlight into the HARPS-N spectrograph, which\nis in turn calibrated with an astro-comb. This setup enables long-term\nobservation of the Sun as a star with state-of-the-art sensitivity to radial\nvelocity changes. Over seven days of observing in 2014, we show an average\n50\\cms radial velocity rms over a few hours of observation.

We studied the role of the snow line in the survival of\nthe inner disk of transition disks. Inside the snow line, the lack of ice\nmantles in dust particles decreases the sticking efficiency between grains. As\na consequence, particles fragment at lower collision velocities than in regions\nbeyond the snow line. This effect allows small particles to be maintained for\nup to a few Myrs within the first astronomical unit. These particles are\nclosely coupled to the gas and do not drift significantly with respect to the\ngas. For lower mass planets (1$M_{\\rm{Jup}}$), the pre-transition appearance\ncan be maintained even longer because dust still trickles through the gap\ncreated by the planet, moves invisibly and quickly in the form of relatively\nlarge grains through the gap, and becomes visible again as it fragments and\ngets slowed down inside of the snow line.

Moreover, orbital stability analysis\nshows tides can drive many hot Jupiters to spiral inevitably toward their host\nstars. Thus, the coupled processes of orbital evolution and RLO likely shape\nthe observed distribution of close-in exoplanets and may even be responsible\nfor producing some of the short-period rocky planets. However, the exact\noutcome for an overflowing planet depends on its internal response to mass\nloss, and the accompanying orbital evolution can act to enhance or inhibit RLO.\nIn this study, we apply the fully-featured and robust Modules for Experiments\nin Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) suite to model RLO of short-period gaseous\nplanets. We show that, although the detailed evolution may depend on several\nproperties of the planetary system, it is largely determined by the core mass\nof the overflowing gas giant. In particular, we find that the orbital expansion\nthat accompanies RLO often stops and reverses at a specific maximum period that\ndepends on the core mass.

These\nmethods are extremely efficient at enhancing the detectability of faint\nastrophysical signal, but they do generally create systematic biases in their\nobserved properties.

We perform a number\nof tests to examine the behaviour of the classifier (completeness, purity and\naccuracy) as a function of source apparent magnitude and Galactic latitude. We\nthen apply the classifier to the full-sky data and analyse the resulting\ncatalogue of candidate galaxies. We also compare thus produced dataset with the\none presented in B16. The tests indicate very high accuracy, completeness and\npurity (>95%) of the classifier at the bright end, deteriorating for the\nfaintest sources, but still retaining acceptable levels of 85%.

This spiral wave instability (SWI)\narises from a resonant interaction between pairs of inertial waves, or\ninertial-gravity waves, and the background spiral wave. The development of the\ninstability in the linear regime involves the growth of a broad spectrum of\ninertial modes, with growth rates on the order of the orbital time, and results\nin a nonlinear saturated state in which turbulent velocity perturbations are of\na similar magnitude to those induced by the spiral wave. The turbulence induces\nangular momentum transport, and vertical mixing, at a rate that depends locally\non the amplitude of the spiral wave (we obtain a stress parameter $\\alpha \\sim\n5 \\times 10^{-4}$ in our reference model).

Chemical\nkinetics models have been widely used in the literature to investigate the\nchemical compositions of hot Jupiter atmospheres which are expected to be\ndriven away from chemical equilibrium via processes such as vertical mixing and\nphotochemistry. All of these models have so far used pressure--temperature\n(P-T) profiles as fixed model input. This results in a decoupling of the\nchemistry from the radiative and thermal properties of the atmosphere, despite\nthe fact that in nature they are intricately linked. We use a one-dimensional\nradiative-convective equilibrium model, ATMO, which includes a sophisticated\nchemistry scheme to calculate P-T profiles which are fully consistent with\nnon-equilibrium chemical abundances, including vertical mixing and\nphotochemistry. Our primary conclusion is that, in cases of strong chemical\ndisequilibrium, consistent calculations can lead to differences in the P-T\nprofile of up to 100 K compared to the P-T profile derived assuming chemical\nequilibrium. This temperature change can, in turn, have important consequences\nfor the chemical abundances themselves as well as for the simulated emission\nspectra. In particular, we find that performing the chemical kinetics\ncalculation consistently can reduce the overall impact of non-equilibrium\nchemistry on the observable emission spectrum of hot Jupiters. Simulated\nobservations derived from non-consistent models could thus yield the wrong\ninterpretation. We show that this behaviour is due to the non-consistent models\nviolating the energy budget balance of the atmosphere. \n\n"}

Here we show how the E- and B-mode powers depend on the\ndetailed properties of the fluctuations in the magnetized interstellar medium.\nThese fluctuations are classified into the slow, fast, and Alfv\\'en\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves, which are determined once the ratio of gas to\nmagnetic-field pressures is specified.

We\nfind that the observed EE/BB ratio (and its scale invariance) and positive TE\ncorrelation cannot be easily explained in terms of favored models for MHD\nturbulence. The observed power-law index for temperature/polarization\nfluctuations also disfavors MHD turbulence. We thus speculate that the 0.1--30\npc length scales probed by these dust-polarization measurements are not\ndescribed by MHD turbulence but, rather, probe the large-scale physics that\ndrives ISM turbulence.

Moreover, the presence of two or more stars within a system can place\nfurther constraints on planetary formation, evolution, and orbital dynamics.

Studies have shown that giant\nplanets that migrate through the protoplanetary disk can accrete substantial\namounts of oxygen-rich planetesimals, leading to super-solar metallicities in\nthe envelope and solar or sub-solar C/O ratios. Pebble accretion has been\ndemonstrated to play an important role in core accretion and to have growth\nrates that are consistent with planetary migration. The high pebble accretion\nrates allow planetary cores to start their growth beyond 10 AU and subsequently\nmigrate to cold (>~ 1 AU), warm (~0.1 AU- 1AU) or hot (<~ 0.1 AU) orbits. In\nthis work we investigate how the formation of giant planets via pebble\naccretion influences their atmospheric chemical compositions. We find that\nunder the standard pebble accretion scenario, where the core is isolated from\nthe envelope, the resulting metallicities (O/H and C/H ratios) are sub-solar,\nwhile the C/O ratios are super-solar. Planets that migrate through the disk to\nbecome hot Jupiters accrete substantial amounts of water vapour, but still\nacquire slightly sub-solar O/H and super-solar C/O of 0.7-0.8.

Abstract: Photometry of short-period planetary systems allows astronomers to monitor\nexoplanets, their host stars, and their mutual interactions. In addition to the\ntransits of a planet in front of its star and the eclipses of the planet by its\nstar, researchers have reported flux variations at the orbital frequency and\nits harmonics: planetary reflection and/or emission and Doppler beaming of\nstarlight produce one peak per orbit, while ellipsoidal variations of a tidally\ndistorted star and/or planet produce two maxima per orbit. Researchers have\nalso reported significant photometric variability at three times the orbital\nfrequency, sometimes much greater than the predictions of tidal theory. The\nreflected phase variations of a homogeneous planet contains power at even\norbital harmonics-important for studies of ellipsoidal variations-but cannot\ncontain odd orbital harmonics. We show that odd harmonics can, however, be\nproduced by an edge-on planet with a time-variable map, or an inclined planet\nwith a North-South (N-S) asymmetric map. Either of these scenarios entail\nweather: short-period planets are expected to have zero obliquity and hence N-S\nsymmetric stellar forcing. North-South asymmetry in a giant planet would\ntherefore suggest stochastic localized features, such as weather. However, we\nfind that previous claims of large-amplitude odd modes in Kepler photometry are\nartifacts of removing planetary transits rather than modeling them. The only\nreliable claims of odd harmonics remain HAT-P-7b and Kepler-13Ab, for which the\nthird mode amplitude is 6-8% of the planetary flux. Although time-variable\nalbedo maps could in principle explain these odd harmonics, upper-limits on the\ninfrared variability of hot Jupiters make this hypothesis unlikely.

We study fluid collapse, using the close analogy\nbetween the gas entropy and the PPSD in the fluid approximation. Our\nhydrodynamic calculations allow for a precise evaluation of logarithmic\nderivatives. For scale-free initial conditions, entropy is a power law in\nLagrangian (mass) coordinates, but not in Eulerian (radial) coordinates. The\ndeviation from a radial power law arises from incomplete hydrostatic\nequilibrium (HSE), linked to bulk inflow and mass accretion, and the\nconvergence to the asymptotic central power-law slope is very slow. For more\nrealistic collapse, entropy is not a power law with either radius or mass due\nto deviations from HSE and scale-dependent initial conditions. Instead, it is a\nslowly rolling power law that appears approximately linear on a log-log plot.\nOur fluid calculations recover PPSD power-law slopes and residual amplitudes\nsimilar to N-body simulations, indicating that deviations from a power law are\nnot numerical artefacts. In addition, we find that realistic collapse is not\nself-similar: scale lengths such as the shock radius and the turnaround radius\nare not power-law functions of time. We therefore argue that the apparent\npower-law PPSD cannot be used to make detailed dynamical inferences or\nextrapolate halo profiles inward, and that it does not indicate any hidden\nintegrals of motion.

In an attempt to unravel their\nphysical nature, visible spectroscopy of both targets was obtained using the\nOSIRIS camera-spectrograph at the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC). From\nthe spectral analysis, we find that 474640-2013 RF98 have similar spectral\nslopes (12 vs. 15 %/0.1um), very different from Sedna's but compatible with\nthose of (148209) 2000 CR105 and 2012 VP113.

Here we use a 3D Global Climate Model to\nsimulate the ability of frozen planets to escape from glaciation by\naccumulating enough gaseous CO$_2$. We find that Earth-like planets orbiting a\nSun-like star may never be able to escape from glaciation if their orbital\ndistance is greater than $\\sim$ 1.27 AU (Flux $<$ 847 W m$^{-2}$ or 62$\\%$ of\nthe Solar constant), because CO$_2$ would condense at the poles forming\npermanent CO$_2$ ice caps. This limits the amount of CO$_2$ in the atmosphere\nand thus its greenhouse effect. The amount of CO$_2$ that can be trapped in the\npolar caps depends on the efficiency of CO$_2$ ice to flow laterally as well as\nits graviational stability relative to subsurface water ice. The flow of CO$_2$\nice from poles to equator is mostly controlled by the bottom temperature, and\nhence by the internal heat flux. We find that a frozen Earth-like planet\nlocated at 1.30 AU of a Sun-like star could store as much as 1.5/4.5/15 bars of\ndry ice at the poles, for internal heat fluxes of 100/30/10 mW m$^{-2}$. But\nthese amounts are lower limits. For planets with a significant water ice cover,\nwe show that CO$_2$ ice deposits should be gravitationnally unstable. They get\nburied beneath the water ice cover in geologically short timescales of\n$\\sim$~10$^4$ yrs, mainly controlled by the viscosity of water ice. CO$_2$\nwould be permanently sequestered underneath the water ice cover, in the form of\nCO$_2$ liquids, CO$_2$ clathrate hydrates and/or dissolved in subglacial water\nreservoirs (if any). This would considerably increase the amount of CO$_2$\ntrapped and further reduce the probability of deglaciation. \n\n"}

Our aim is to provide diameters and albedos of MCs\nwith available WISE/NEOWISE data. Methods. We used the near-Earth asteroid\nthermal model to find the best-fitting values of equivalent diameter and,\nwhenever possible, the infrared beaming parameter. With the diameter and\ntabulated asteroid absolute magnitudes we also computed the visible geometric\nalbedos. Results. We determined the diameters and beaming parameters of 404\nobjects observed during the fully cryogenic phase of the WISE mission, most of\nwhich have not been published elsewhere. We also obtained 1572 diameters from\ndata from the 3-Band and posterior non-cryogenic phases using a default value\nof beaming parameter. The average beaming parameter is 1.2 +/- 0.2 for objects\nsmaller than 10 km, which constitute most of our sample. This is higher than\nthe typical value of 1.0 found for the whole main belt and is possibly related\nto the fact that WISE is able to observe many more small objects at shorter\nheliocentric distances, i.e. at higher phase angles. We argue that this is a\nbetter default value for modelling Mars-crossing asteroids from the\nWISE/NEOWISE catalogue and discuss the effects of this choice on the diameter\nand albedo distributions. We find a double-peaked distribution for the visible\ngeometric albedos, which is expected since this population is compositionally\ndiverse and includes objects in the major spectral complexes.

Our aim is to understand the cause of\nthe non-convergence of the cooling boundary for fragmentation reported in the\nliterature. We run SPH simulations with two different artificial viscosity\nimplementations, and compare them with MFM, which does not employ any\nartificial viscosity. With MFM we demonstrate convergence of the critical\ncooling time scale for fragmentation at \\beta_{crit} =3.. Non-convergence\npersists in SPH codes, although it is significantly mitigated with schemes\nhaving reduced artificial viscosity such as inviscid SPH (ISPH) (Cullen &\nDehnen 2010). We show how the non-convergence problem is caused by artificial\nfragmentation triggered by excessive dissipation of angular momentum in domains\nwith large velocity derivatives. With increased resolution such domains become\nmore prominent. Vorticity lags behind density due to numerical viscous\ndissipation in these regions, promoting collapse with longer cooling times.\nSuch effect is shown to be dominant over the competing tendency of artificial\nviscosity to diminish with increasing resolution. When the initial conditions\nare first relaxed for several orbits, the flow is more regular, with lower\nshear and vorticity in non-axisymmetric regions, aiding convergence. Yet MFM is\nthe only method that converges exactly. Our findings are of general interest as\nnumerical dissipation via artificial viscosity or advection errors can also\noccur in grid-based codes.

Four types of particles\nwere used: mm-sized acrylic, glass, and copper beads, and 0.75 mm-sized JSC-1\nlunar regolith simulant grains. The particles were placed in sample cells\ncarved out of an aluminum tray. This tray was attached to one side of the\npayload casing with three springs. Every 60~s, the tray was agitated and the\nresulting collisions between the particles in the sample cells were recorded by\nthe experiment camera.\n  During the 18 months the payload stayed on ISS, we obtained 158 videos, thus\nrecording a great number of collisions.

After shaking\nstopped, the inter-particle collisions damped the particle kinetic energy in\nless than 20~s, reducing the average particle velocity to below 1 mm/s, and\neventually slowing them to below our detection threshold.

We describe the temporal evolution of the planetary\nmass-luminosity relation. We study the shock and internal luminosity during\nformation. We predict a statistical version of the post-formation mass versus\nentropy \"tuning fork\" diagram. We find high nominal post-formation luminosities\nfor hot and cold gas accretion. Individual formation histories can still lead\nto a factor of a few spread in the post-formation luminosity at a given mass.\nHowever, if the gas and planetesimal accretional heating is unknown, the\npost-formation luminosity may exhibit a spread of as much as 2-3 orders of\nmagnitude at a fixed mass covering cold, warm, and hot states. As a key result\nwe predict a flat log-luminosity distribution for giant planets, and a steep\nincrease towards lower luminosities due to the higher occurrence rate of\nlow-mass planets. Future surveys may detect this upturn. During formation an\nestimate of the planet mass may be possible for cold gas accretion if the gas\naccretion rate can be estimated. Due to the \"core-mass effect\" planets that\nunderwent cold gas accretion can still have high post-formation entropies.

We use Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics\nincluding a radiative transfer scheme, along with time-dependent chemical\nevolution code to follow the composition of the disc and resulting fragments\nover approximately 4000 yrs.

Besides using the angular momentum of the 15 solar-mass model\nas obtained in the stellar evolution calculation with an angular frequency of\nabout 0.001 rad/s (spin period of more than 6000 s) at the Si/Si-O interface,\nwe also computed 2D and 3D cases with no rotation and with a ~300 times shorter\nrotation period and different angular resolutions. In 2D, only the nonrotating\nand slowly rotating models explode, while rapid rotation prevents an explosion\nwithin 500 ms after bounce because of lower radiated neutrino luminosities and\nmean energies and thus reduced neutrino heating. In contrast, only the fast\nrotating model develops an explosion in 3D when the Si/Si-O interface collapses\nthrough the shock. The explosion becomes possible by the support of a powerful\nSASI spiral mode, which compensates for the reduced neutrino heating and pushes\nstrong shock expansion in the equatorial plane.

We\nfurther investigate this reported anti-correlation here using a dataset\ncomprising exoplanets discovered with both the RV and transit methods,\nsearching for hints of its causes by exploring the connection between the\nnumber of planets and the dynamical state of the exosystems. To examine the\ncorrelation between multiplicity and orbital eccentricity, for every\nmultiplicity case considered (1<M<7), we computed the weighted average\neccentricities instead of the median eccentricities used previously. The\naverage eccentricities were calculated using the inverse of the uncertainty on\nthe eccentricity values as weights. The analysis of the dynamic state of the\nexosystems was performed by computing their angular momentum deficit (AMD), a\ndiagnostic parameter used in the study of solar system and recently applied to\nexosystems. Our results confirm the reported multiplicity-eccentricity\nanti-correlation and show that the use of the uncertainties on the orbital\neccentricities in the analysis allows for a better agreement between data and\nfits. Our best fit reproduces well the behaviour of average eccentricities for\nall systems with M>1, including the additional cases of TRAPPIST-1 (M=7) and\nsolar system (M=8). The AMD analysis, while not conclusive due to the limited\nnumber of exosystems that could be analysed, also suggests the existence of an\nanti-correlation between the multiplicity and the AMD of exosystems.

However there remains a lack of\nconsensus on the physical mechanism(s) responsible for initiating it. One\npotential avenue is disc photoevaporation, wherein the preferential removal of\nrelatively dust-free gas increases the disc metallicity. Late in the disc\nlifetime, photoevaporation dominates viscous accretion, creating a gradient in\nthe depleted gas surface density near the location of the gap. This induces a\nlocal pressure maximum that collects drifting dust particles, which may then\nbecome susceptible to the streaming instability. Using a one-dimensional\nviscous evolution model of a disc subject to internal X-ray photoevaporation,\nwe explore the efficacy of this process to build planetestimals. Over a range\nof parameters we find that the amount of dust mass converted into planetesimals\nis often < 1 M_Earth and at most a few M_Earth spread across tens of AU. We\nconclude that photoevaporation may at best be relevant for the formation of\ndebris discs, rather than a common mechanism for the formation of planetary\ncores. Our results are in contrast to a recent, similar investigation that\nconsidered an FUV-driven photoevaporation model and reported the formation of\ntens of M_Earth at large (> 100 AU) disc radii.

With the intention of using CN as a diagnostic, we also address to\nwhich physical and chemical parameters CN is most sensitive. A set of disk\nmodels were run for different stellar spectra, masses, and physical structures\nvia the 2D thermochemical code DALI. An updated chemical network that accounts\nfor the most relevant CN reactions was adopted. Ring-shaped emission is found\nto be a common feature of all adopted models; the highest abundance is found in\nthe upper outer regions of the disk, and the column density peaks at 30-100 AU\nfor T Tauri stars with standard accretion rates. Higher mass disks generally\nshow brighter CN. Higher UV fields, such as those appropriate for T Tauri stars\nwith high accretion rates or for Herbig Ae stars or for higher disk flaring,\ngenerally result in brighter and larger rings. These trends are due to the main\nformation paths of CN, which all start with vibrationally excited H2*\nmolecules, that are produced through far ultraviolet (FUV) pumping of H2. The\nmodel results compare well with observed disk-integrated CN fluxes and the\nobserved location of the CN ring for the TW Hya disk.

However, binary interactions are not\nunderstood from first principles, and the theoretical models are subject to\nmany assumptions. It is currently agreed upon that hot subdwarf stars can only\nbe formed through binary interaction, either through common envelope ejection\nor stable Roche-lobe overflow (RLOF) near the tip of the red giant branch\n(RGB). These systems are therefore an ideal testing ground for binary\ninteraction models.

By carrying out two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations varying\nplanet mass and disk gas temperature, we find that a larger number of spiral\narms form with a smaller planet mass and a lower disk temperature. A planet\nexcites two or more spiral arms interior to its orbit for a range of disk\ntemperature characterized by the disk aspect ratio $0.04\\leq(h/r)_p\\leq0.15$,\nwhereas exterior to a planet's orbit multiple spiral arms can form only in cold\ndisks with $(h/r)_p \\lesssim 0.06$. Constraining the planet mass with the pitch\nangle of spiral arms requires accurate disk temperature measurements that might\nbe challenging even with ALMA. However, the property that the pitch angle of\nplanet-driven spiral arms decreases away from the planet can be a powerful\ndiagnostic to determine whether the planet is located interior or exterior to\nthe observed spirals. The arm-to-arm separations increase as a function of\nplanet mass, consistent with previous studies; however, the exact slope depends\non disk temperature as well as the radial location where the arm-to-arm\nseparations are measured.

In this paper, we carry out a systematic study\nemploying long-term numerical simulations aimed at characterizing the critical\nparticle-size for retention outside a gap as a function of particle size and\nfor various key parameters defining the protoplanetary disk model. To this end,\nwe perform multifluid hydrodynamical simulations in two dimensions, including\ndifferent dust species, which we treat as pressureless fluids. We initialize\nthe dust outside of the planet's orbit and study under which conditions dust\ngrains are able to cross the gap carved by the planet. In agreement with\nprevious work, we find that the permeability of the gap depends both on dust\ndynamical properties and the gas disk structure: while small dust follows the\nviscously accreting gas through the gap, dust grains approaching a critical\nsize are progressively filtered out.

Many of these planetary systems exhibit multiple members,\nbut a large fraction possess only a single transiting example. This\noverabundance of singles has lead to the suggestion that up to half of Kepler\nsystems might possess significant mutual inclinations between orbits, reducing\nthe transiting number (the so-called \"Kepler Dichotomy\"). In a recent paper,\nSpalding & Batygin (2016) demonstrated that the quadrupole moment arising from\na young, oblate star is capable of misaligning the constituent orbits of a\nclose-in planetary system enough to reduce their transit number, provided that\nthe stellar spin axis is sufficiently misaligned with respect to the planetary\norbital plane. Moreover, tightly packed planetary systems were shown to be\nsusceptible to becoming destabilized during this process. Here, we investigate\nthe ubiquity of the stellar obliquity-driven instability within systems with a\nrange of multiplicities. We find that most planetary systems analysed,\nincluding those possessing only 2 planets, underwent instability for stellar\nspin periods below ~3 days and stellar tilts of order 30 degrees. Moreover, we\nare able to place upper limits on the stellar obliquity in systems such as\nK2-38 (obliquity <20 degrees), where other methods of measuring spin-orbit\nmisalignment are not currently available.

Therefore the evolution of protoplanetary discs (PPDs) hosted by such\nstars are subject to the influence of other members of the cluster. Physically,\nPPDs might be truncated either by photoevaporation due to ultraviolet flux from\nmassive stars, or tidal truncation due to close stellar encounters. Here we aim\nto compare the two effects in real cluster environments. In this vein we first\nreview the properties of well studied stellar clusters with a focus on stellar\nnumber density, which largely dictates the degree of tidal truncation, and far\nultraviolet (FUV) flux, which is indicative of the rate of external\nphotoevaporation. We then review the theoretical PPD truncation radius due to\nan arbitrary encounter, additionally taking into account the role of eccentric\nencounters that play a role in hot clusters with a 1D velocity dispersion\n$\\sigma_v > 2$ km/s. Our treatment is then applied statistically to varying\nlocal environments to establish a canonical threshold for the local stellar\ndensity ($n_{c} > 10^4$ pc$^{-3}$) for which encounters can play a significant\nrole in shaping the distribution of PPD radii over a timescale $\\sim 3$ Myr. By\ncombining theoretical mass loss rates due to FUV flux with viscous spreading in\na PPD we establish a similar threshold for which a massive disc is completely\ndestroyed by external photoevaporation.

During their journey to perihelion, comets may appear in the\nfield-of-view of space-borne optical instruments, showing in some cases a\nnicely developed plasma tail extending from their coma and exhibiting an\noscillatory behaviour. Aims. The oscillations of cometary tails may be\nexplained in terms of vortex shedding because of the interaction of the comet\nwith the solar wind streams. Therefore, it is possible to exploit these\noscillations in order to infer the value of the Strouhal number $St$, which\nquantifies the vortex shedding phenomenon, and the physical properties of the\nlocal medium. Methods. We used the Heliospheric Imager (HI) data of the Solar\nTErrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) mission to study the oscillations of\nthe tails of the comets 2P/Encke and C/2012 S1 (ISON) during their perihelion\nin Nov 2013, determining the Strouhal numbers from the estimates of the halo\nsize, the relative speed of the solar wind flow and the period of the\noscillations.

The RV data is modelled\ntogether with the Kepler photometry using a photodynamical model. The inclusion\nof velocity information breaks the $MR^{-3}$ degeneracy inherent in timing data\nalone, allowing us to measure the absolute stellar and planetary radii and\nmasses. With uncertainties of 12% and 13% for the stellar and inner planet\nradii, and 35%, 24%, and 35% for the masses of the star, planet b, and planet c\nrespectively, these measurements are the most precise to date for a single host\nstar system using this technique. The transiting planet mass is determined at\nbetter precision than the star mass. This shows that modelling the radial\nvelocities and the light curve together in systems of dynamically interacting\nplanets provides a way of characterising both the star and the planets without\nbeing limited by knowledge of the star. On the other hand, the period ratio and\neccentricities place the Kepler-419 system in a sweet spot; had around twice as\nmany transits been observed, the mass of the transiting planet could have been\nmeasured using its own TTVs. Finally, the origin of the Kepler-419 system is\ndiscussed.

As shown in Paper I, a dynamical corotation torque arises due to the\nflow-induced asymmetric distortion of the corotation region and the evolving\nvortensity contrast between the librating horseshoe material and background\ndisc flow. Using simulations of laminar torqued discs containing migrating\nplanets, we demonstrate the existence of the four distinct migration regimes\npredicted in Paper I.

In addition, we demonstrate torque and migration reversals induced\nby midplane magnetic stresses, with a bifurcation dependent on the disc surface\ndensity. We develop a model for fast migration, and show why the outward\nrunaway saturates to a steady speed, and examine phenomenologically its\ntermination due to changing local disc conditions.

We\nobtained $0.5^{\"}$ ALMA observations of DM Tau in Bands 4 and 6 in lines of CS,\nSO, SO$_2$, OCS, CCS, H$_2$CS and H$_2$S, achieving a $\\sim 5$ mJy sensitivity.\nUsing the non-LTE radiative transfer code RADEX and the forward-modeling tool\nDiskFit, disk-averaged CS column densities and upper limits for the other\nspecies were derived. Results. Only CS was detected with a derived column\ndensity of $\\sim 2-6 \\times 10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$. We report a first tentative\ndetection of SO$_2$ in DM Tau. The upper limits range between $\\sim 10^{11}$\nand $10^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$ for the other S-bearing species. The best-fit chemical\nmodel matching these values requires a gas-phase C/O ratio of > 1 at $r \\sim\n50-100$ au. With chemical modeling we demonstrate that sulfur-bearing species\ncould be robust tracers of the gas-phase C/O ratio, surface reaction rates,\ngrain size and UV intensities. Conclusions. The lack of detections of a variety\nof sulfur-bearing molecules in DM Tau other than CS implies a dearth of\nreactive sulfur in the gas phase, either through efficient freeze-out or\nbecause most of the elemental sulfur is in other large species, as found in\ncomets. The inferred high CS/SO and CS/SO$_2$ ratios require a non-solar C/O\ngas-phase ratio of > 1, consistent with the recent observations of hydrocarbon\nrings in DM Tau. The stronger depletion of oxygen-bearing S-species compared to\nCS is likely linked to the low observed abundances of gaseous water in DM Tau\nand points to a removal mechanism of oxygen from the gas. \n\n"}

Although the\naerodynamic drag from the dust on the gas is weaker than in the case where all\ngrains are optimally coupled to the gas, the cumulative \"back-reaction\" of the\ndust particles can still alter the gas dynamics significantly. In typical\nprotoplanetary discs, the net effect of the dust back-reaction decreases the\ngas accretion flow compared to the dust-free (viscous) case, even for\ndust-to-gas ratios of order $1\\%$. In the outer disc, where dust grains are\ntypically less strongly coupled to the gas and settle towards the midplane, the\ndust back-reaction can even drive outward gas flow. Moreover, the radial inward\ndrift of large grains is reduced below the gas motion in the inner disc\nregions, while small dust grains follow the gas dynamics over all the disc\nextent. The resulting dust and gas dynamics can give rise to observable\nstructures, such as gas and dust cavities.

However, the satellitesimal formation itself\nposes a nontrivial problem as the dust evolution in the circumplanetary disk is\nheavily impacted by fast radial drift and thus dust growth to satellitesimals\nis hindered. To address this problem, we connected state-of-the-art\nhydrodynamical simulations of a circumplanetary disk around a Jupiter-mass\nplanet with dust growth and drift model in a post-processing step. We found\nthat there is an efficient pathway to satellitesimal formation if there is a\ndust trap forming within the disk.

The\nstreaming instability leads to the efficient formation of the satellite seeds.\nBecause of the constant infall of material from the circumstellar disk and the\nvery short timescale of dust evolution, the circumplanetary disk acts as a\nsatellitesimal factory, constantly processing the infalling dust to pebbles\nthat gather in the dust trap and undergo the streaming instability. \n\n"}

We revisit the model of magnetic\ngrain trapping around main-sequence stars of various spectral classes by taking\ninto account sublimation and electric charging of the grains. The model of\nmagnetic grain trapping predicts that hot dust grains are present in the\nvicinity of main-sequence stars with high rotation velocities and intermediate\nmagnetic-field strengths. On the contrary, we find that the detection of hot\ndust grains has no correlation with the rotation velocities of central stars\nnor the magnetic field strengths of the stars. Our numerical evaluation of\nelectric grain charging indicates that the surface potential of\nsubmicrometer-sized grains in the vicinity of main-sequence stars is typically\n4-5 V, which is one order of magnitude smaller than the value assumed by the\nmodel of magnetic grain trapping. On the basis of our numerical simulation on\nsublimation of dust grains in the vicinity of a star, it turns out that their\nlives end due to sublimation in a timescale much shorter than the period of one\nrevolution at the gyroradius.

We\nuse stellar kinematics and HI gas rotation curves to infer the inner dark\nmatter densities of eight dwarf spheroidal and eight dwarf irregular galaxies\nwith a wide range of star formation histories.

The microlensing\nlight-curve models indicate a high-magnification event with a maximum of\n$A_\\mathrm{max}\\gtrsim200$, very sensitive to planetary deviations.

The spectro-photometric signal is not affected\nonly by image movement and deformation due to wavefront error but also by\nelectrical variation in the detector system. These time-variation components,\ncoupled to the transit signal, distort the measurements of atmospheric\ncomposition in transit spectroscopy. Here we propose a new concept for\nimprovement of spectro-photometric accuracy through the calibration of the\ntime-variation components in the detector system by developing densified pupil\nspectroscopy that provides multiple spectra of the star-planet system. Owing to\na group of pixels exposed by the object light (i.e., science pixels),\npixel-to-pixel variations can be smoothed out through an averaging operation,\nthus only common time-variation components over the science pixels remain. In\naddition, considering that the detector plane is optically conjugated to the\npupil plane, a pupil mask can completely block astronomical light incoming into\nresidual pixels. The common time-variation components are reconstructed with\nthe residual pixels and reduced into a random term. Applying the densified\npupil spectrograph with a mid-infrared detector system to a large space\ncryogenic telescope such as the Origins Space Telescope, we show that the\nsystem nearly achieves photon-noise-limited performance and detects absorption\nfeatures through transmission spectroscopy and secondary eclipse of terrestrial\nplanets orbiting M-type stars at 10 pc with 60 transit observations.

If\nthese BBHs are the product of binary evolution, then PPISNe could occur in very\nclose binaries. Motivated by this, we discuss the implications of a PPISN\nhappening with a close binary companion, and what impact these events have on\nthe formation of merging BBHs through binary evolution. For this, we have\ncomputed a set of models of metal-poor ($Z_\\odot/10$) single helium stars using\nthe \\texttt{MESA} software instrument.

The planetary\nphotometric emissions are due to the thermal emissions of the exoplanet, and\nreflected stellar light.

For extremely close-in exoplanets\nthe finite angular size of the host star must be taken into account and the\nplane parallel ray model breaks down. One consequence of modeling the incident\nstellar radiation in this manner is the creation of three distinct zones as\nopposed to the two zones present in the plane parallel ray model.

We present the\nfirst CO detection in a planetesimal belt around an M star, TWA 7. The\noptically thin CO (J=3-2) emission is co-located with previously identified\ndust emission from the belt, and the emission velocity structure is consistent\nwith Keplerian rotation around the central star. The detected CO is not well\nshielded against photodissociation, and must thus be continuously replenished\nby gas release from exocomets within the belt.

More luminous stars will therefore on average host more\nmassive (and hence more easily detectable) exocometary CO disks, leading to the\nhigher detection rates observed.

It has been considered at all\nconvective boundaries, including the He-flash convection zone in the intershell\nregion which forms during the thermal pulses.

The existence of such an\ninstability is not suggested by the well-known Solberg-Hoiland criterion.

These galaxies, as measured from SDSS and\nin the Local Group, show tight correlations of internal velocity, metallicity\nand surface brightness (or radius) with M*. They define a fundamental line\ndistinguishing them from the brighter galaxies of high surface brightness and\nmetallicity. The idealized model assumes spherical collapse of CDM haloes to\nvirial equilibrium and angular-momentum conservation. The relations for bright\ngalaxies are reproduced by assuming that M* is a constant fraction of the halo\nmass M. The upper bound to the low-luminosity LSBs coincides with the virial\nvelocity of haloes in which supernova feedback could significantly suppress\nstar formation, V<100km/s (Dekel & Silk 1986).

In our new analysis, we\nexamine this time interval in greater detail. In addition to the 2240 sec\nperiod we find evidence for other periods, the most prominent being near 3500\nsec.

The electric field easily exceeds the breakdown value of ~1 V\nm^-1 over distances of order 0.1 AU. The energy in a giant lightning discharge\nexceeds a terrestrial lightning flash by a factor of ~10^12. The predicted\npost-burst emission of gamma-rays from accretion into the newly formed black\nhole or spin-down of the magnetar is sufficiently intense to cause a lightning\nstorm in the nebula that lasts for days and is more probable than the GRB\nbecause the radiation is beamed into a larger solid angle.

Our\nresults are in excellent agreement with measurements of the spatial\ndistribution of quasars, and we detect an intriguing excess of galaxy-quasar\npairs at very short separations. We also reproduce the anti-hierarchical\nturnoff in the quasar luminosity function, however, the magnitude of the\nturn-off falls short of that observed as well as that predicted by analogous\nsemi-analytic models.

These data allow us\nto investigate the physics of the highly relativistic fireball outflow and its\ninteraction with the circumburst environment.

Unexpectedly, they are characterised by\ndifferent slopes, with a very steep decay in the first few hundred of seconds,\nfollowed by a flatter decay and, a few thousand of seconds later, by a somewhat\nsteeper decay. Often strong flare activity up to few hours after the burst\nexplosion is also seen. These flares, most likely, are still related to the\ncentral engine activity, that last much longer than expected and it is still\ndominating the X-ray light curve well after the prompt phase, up to a few\nthousand of seconds. The real afterglow emission (external shock) is dominating\nthe X-ray light curve only after the flatter phase ends.

This event, originating from a Galactic\nneutron star, displayed exceptional energetics. Recent investigations of the\nX-ray light curve's pulsating tail revealed the presence of Quasi-Periodic\nOscillations (QPOs) in the 30 - 2000 Hz frequency range, most of which\ncoincides with the bandwidth of the LIGO detectors. These QPOs, with\nwell-characterized frequencies, can plausibly be attributed to seismic modes of\nthe neutron star which could emit GWs. Our search targeted potential\nquasi-monochromatic GWs lasting for tens of seconds and emitted at the QPO\nfrequencies. We have observed no candidate signals above a pre-determined\nthreshold and our lowest upper limit was set by the 92.5 Hz QPO observed in the\ninterval from 150 s to 260 s after the start of the flare.

These are\nstrong non-axisymmetric features which significantly affect orbits of stars and\ndark matter particles. One of the main effects is the dynamical resonances\nbetween galactic material and the bar. We detect and characterize these\nresonances in N-body models of barred galaxies by measuring angular and radial\nfrequencies of individual orbits. We found narrow peaks in the distribution of\norbital frequencies with each peak corresponding to a specific resonance. We\nfound five different resonances in the stellar disk and two in the dark matter.\nThe corotation resonance and the inner and outer Lindblad resonances are the\nmost populated. The spatial distributions of particles near resonances are\nwide. For example, the inner Lindblad resonance is not localized at a given\nradius. Particles near this resonance are mainly distributed along the bar and\nspan a wide range of radii. On the other hand, particles near the corotation\nresonance are distributed in two broad areas around the two stable Lagrange\npoints. The distribution resembles a wide ring at the corotation radius.\nResonances capture disk and halo material in near-resonant orbits. Our analysis\nof orbits in both N-body simulations and in simple analytical models indicates\nthat resonances tend to prevent the dynamical evolution of this trapped\nmaterial. Only if the bar evolves as a whole, resonances drift through the\nphase space. In this case particles anchored near resonant orbits track the\nresonance shift and evolve. The criteria to ensure a correct resonant behavior\ndiscussed in Weinberg & Katz (2007a) can be achieved with few millions\nparticles because the regions of trapped orbits near resonances are large and\nevolving. \n\n"}

Abstract: We have studied using the KLUN sample of 5171 spiral galaxies having\nTully-Fisher distance moduli, the average radial space distribution of galaxies\nout to a distance of about 200 Mpc (for H_0=50 km/s/Mpc). One motivation came\nfrom the current debate on the fractal dimension D and maximum scale of\nfractality. To study this question, we used a new method based on photometric\nTF distances, independent of redshift, to construct the number density\ndistribution. Our main results are:\n  (1) While scattered below about 20 Mpc, at larger distances the radial\ndistribution starts to follow, in terms of distance modulus mu_TF, the law log\nN = 0.46 mu + const., using diameter TF relation, and log N = 0.40 mu + const.\nfor magnitudes. These are the predictions based on fractal dimensions 2.3 and\n2.0, respectively. These radial density gradients are valid up to the limits of\nKLUN, or about 200 Mpc.\n  (2) We have tried to understand the derived radial density behaviour as a\nresult of some bias in KLUN or our analysis, however, without success.\nNumerical simulations have shown that the method itself works. If the density\nlaw is caused by incompleteness in the diameter limited KLUN sample, then the\nincompleteness should start at widely different angular diameters d_25 for\ndifferent values of rotation parameter log V_M, which would be quite\nunexpected.\n  (3) If correlation studies favoring long scale fractality (200 Mpc or more)\nand D ~ 2 are correct, the position of our Galaxy would be close to average in\nthe Universe, with the galaxy density decreasing around us according to the\nexpected law. \n\n"}

We study the evolution of strain in\nthe crust, the initiation of starquakes, and possible consequences for magnetic\nfield and torque evolution. Crust cracking occurs as equatorial material shears\nunder the compressive forces arising from the star's decreasing circumference,\nand matter moves to higher latitudes along a fault inclined to the equator. A\nstarquake is most likely to originate near one of the two points on the\nrotational equator farthest from the magnetic poles. The material breaks along\na fault approximately aligned with the magnetic poles. We suggest that the\nobserved offsets come about when a starquake perturbs the star's mass\ndistribution, producing a misalignment of the angular momentum and spin axes.\nSubsequently, damped precession to a new rotational state increases the angle\nalpha between the rotation and magnetic axes.

We also show that this\nprescription does not reproduce the exact result for a sharp transition. Then,\nmore generally, we demonstrate that, in the only case where a bounce can be\nobtained in Einstein General Relativity without facing singularities and/or\nviolation of the standard energy conditions, the bounce cannot be made\narbitrarily short. This contrasts with the standard (inflationary) situation\nwhere the transition between two eras with different values of the equation of\nstate can be considered as instantaneous. We then argue that the usually\nconserved quantities are not constant on a typical bounce time scale. Finally,\nwe also examine the case of a test scalar field (or gravitational waves) where\nsimilar results are obtained. We conclude that the full dynamical equations of\nthe underlying theory should be solved in a non singular case before any\nconclusion can be drawn. \n\n"}

The bounces we consider normally would be\nexpected to require an energy density which violates the weak energy condition,\nand for our co-dimension one examples this is attributable to bulk curvature\nterms in the effective Friedmann equation.

Clustering is there optimal when the particle response time is\nof the order of the Kolmogorov time scale $\\tau_\\eta$. In the inertial range,\nthe particle distribution is no longer scale-invariant.

{"id": "nlin/0701033", "contents": "Title: Toward a phenomenological approach to the clustering of heavy particles\n  in turbulent flows Abstract: A simple model accounting for the ejection of heavy particles from the\nvortical structures of a turbulent flow is introduced. This model involves a\nspace and time discretization of the dynamics and depends on only two\nparameters: the fraction of space-time occupied by rotating structures of the\ncarrier flow and the rate at which particles are ejected from them. The latter\ncan be heuristically related to the response time of the particles and hence\nmeasure their inertia. It is shown that such a model reproduces qualitatively\nmost aspects of the spatial distribution of heavy particles transported by\nrealistic flows. In particular the probability density function of the mass $m$\nin a cell displays an power-law behavior at small values and decreases faster\nthan exponentially at large values. The dependence of the exponent of the first\ntail upon the parameters of the dynamics is explicitly derived for the model.\nThe right tail is shown to decrease as $\\exp (-C m \\log m)$. Finally, the\ndistribution of mass averaged over several cells is shown to obey rescaling\nproperties as a function of the coarse-grain size and of the ejection rate of\nthe particles. Contrarily to what has been observed in direct numerical\nsimulations of turbulent flows (Bec et al., http://arxiv.org/nlin.CD/0608045),\nsuch rescaling properties are only due in the model to the mass dynamics of the\nparticles and do not involve any scaling properties in the spatial structure of\nthe carrier flow. \n\n"}

A notable example is the kaon which plays\nspecial roles in all the three fields. In this paper, we first review the\nvarious theoretical investigations of kaon properties in nuclear medium,\nfocusing on possible uncertainties in each model. We then present a detailed\ntransport model study of kaon production in heavy-ion collisions at SIS\nenergies. We shall discuss especially the elementary kaon and antikaon\nproduction cross sections in hadron-hadron interactions, that represent one of\nthe most serious uncertainties in the transport model study of particle\nproduction in heavy-ion collisions. The main purpose of such a study is to\nconstrain kaon in-medium properties from the heavy-ion data. This can provide\nuseful guidances for the development of theoretical models of the kaon in\nmedium.
