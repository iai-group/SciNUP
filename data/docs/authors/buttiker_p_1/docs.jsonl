Two cases will take our attention: unpaired phase\nstrangelets, where there is no restriction to the number of flavors of quarks,\nand a particular case of the color superconducting phase, where exists a\nrestriction to the quark numbers and an additional energy gap. We study the\nstability of strangelets, measured by the energy per baryon, to compare later\nwith that of the 56Fe : the most stable isotope known in nature.

Thus far, axion and ALP searches have\nbeen unsuccessful, indicating that their couplings have to be extremely weak.\nHowever, axions and ALPs could be responsible for some observable effects in\nastrophysics and cosmology, which can also be exploited to constrain the\nparameter space of these particles.

We investigate in detail the minimal model with a new real singlet\nscalar which condenses and mixes with the Higgs.

Depending\non the distance of the source, the Universe should be opaque to VHE photons\nabove a certain energy.

A recent statistical analysis of a large\nsample of VHE spectra shows that the correction for absorption with current EBL\nmodels is too strong for the data points with the highest attenuation. An\nexplanation might be the oscillation of VHE photons into hypothetical\naxion-like particles (ALPs) in ambient magnetic fields.

The reason is that the lightest scalar in such theories is heavier than\nthe lightest pseudo-scalar with the mass difference being fixed by the scale of\nthe theory. LHC searches suggest that the scale of any new physics, including\nthat of a putative new theory dynamically generating the 125 GeV \"Higgs\"\nparticle, is relatively high $\\sim{(1/2TeV-1TeV)}$. Also the LHC analysis\nsuggests that it is {\\it scalar} namely $J^P = 0^+$ rather than pseudo-scalar.\nThus it is unlikely that the \"Higgs\" could arise as a composite in such\ntheories- though it will arise in special cases when the underlying binding\ngauge group is real as a fermion-fermion bound state.\n  The direct considerations of the various two point functions in the large\n$N_c$ limit presented below- suggest that massless pseudo-scalars, but not any\nother anomalously light meson, arise as composites of massless fermions say the\nmassless u and $\\bar{d}$ quarks in QCD. These massless pions manifest the\nspontaneous breaking of the global axial symmetry in QCD with the pions being\n(pseudo) Nambu Goldstone Bosons.

Firstly, this allows us to\nderive robust model-independent phenomenological features and, conversely, to\nidentify the peculiarities of different explicit realizations. Secondly, limits\non cross-section times BR can be converted into bounds on a few relevant\nparameters in a fully analytic way, allowing for an interpretation in any given\nexplicit model. Based on the available 8 TeV LHC analyses, we derive current\nlimits and interpret them for vector triplets arising in weakly coupled (gauge)\nand strongly coupled (composite) extensions of the SM. We point out that a\nmodel-independent limit setting procedure must be based on purely on-shell\nquantities, like a cross-section times BR. Finite width effects altering the\nlimits can be considerably reduced by focusing on the on-shell signal region.\nWe illustrate this aspect with a study of the invariant mass distribution in\ndi-lepton searches and the transverse mass distribution in lepton-neutrino\nfinal states.

Surprisingly, and despite the\npotentially large effect due to the strong coupling, this has so far been\nstudied in much less detail for the internal bremsstrahlung of gluons than for\nphotons or electroweak gauge bosons. Here, we aim at bridging that gap by\npresenting a general analysis of neutralino annihilation into quark anti-quark\npairs and a gluon, allowing e.g. for arbitrary neutralino compositions and\nkeeping the leading quark mass dependence at all stages in the calculation. We\nfind in some cases largely enhanced annihilation rates, especially for\nscenarios with squarks being close to degenerate in mass with the lightest\nneutralino, but also notable distortions in the associated antiproton and\ngamma-ray spectra.

We\ndemonstrate that in the canonical string framework such a solution does not\nactually exist because an inconsistency arises between the renormalization\nproperties of the QCD S matrix at large $N$ -- a consequence of the asymptotic\nfreedom (AF) -- and the open/closed duality of the would-be string solution.\nSpecifically, the would-be open-string one-loop corrections to the tree\nglueball amplitudes must be ultraviolet (UV) divergent. Hence, naively, the\ninconsistency arises because these amplitudes are dual to tree closed-string\ndiagrams, which are universally believed to be both UV finite -- since they are\nclosed-string tree diagrams -- and infrared finite because of the glueball mass\ngap. In fact, the inconsistency follows from a low-energy theorem of the NSVZ\ntype that controls the renormalization in QCD-like theories. The inconsistency\nextends to the would-be canonical string for a vast class of 't Hooft large-$N$\nQCD-like theories including $\\mathcal{N}=1$ SUSY QCD.

The model is free from all the U(1)' gauge\nand gravitational anomalies in the presence of the three RHNs. We introduce a\n$Z_2$-parity in the model, under which an odd-parity is assigned to one RHN,\nwhile all the other particles is assigned to be $Z_2$-even, and hence the\n$Z_2$-odd RHN serves as a DM candidate. In this model, the U(1)' gauge symmetry\nis radiatively broken through the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism, by which the\nelectroweak symmetry breaking is triggered. There are three free parameters in\nour model, the U(1)' charge of the SM Higgs doublet ($x_H$), the new U(1)'\ngauge coupling ($g_X$), and the U(1)' gauge boson ($Z'$) mass ($m_{Z'}$), which\nare severely constrained in order to solve the electroweak vacuum instability\nproblem, and satisfy the LHC Run-2 bounds from the search for $Z'$ boson\nresonance.

Provided that sphalerons are fast enough to\nmaintain equilibrium, the values of the baryon and lepton asymmetries are\nrelated to each other.

However there are\ntheoretical reasons to prefer a period of earlier matter domination, prior to\nnucleosynthesis, e.g. due to late decaying massive particles needed to explain\nbaryogenesis. Axion cosmology is quantitatively affected by an early period of\nmatter domination, with a different axion mass range preferred and greater\ninhomogeneity produced on small scales.

Strong suppression of the molecular pentaquark decays\ninto states with hidden charm is qualitatively explained by a relatively large\nsize of the molecular pentaquark. The decay pattern of hadrocharmonium\npentaquarks that are interpreted as loosely bound states of excited charmonium\n$\\psi'$ and nucleons is quite different. This time dominate decays into states\nwith hidden charm, but suppression of the decays with charm exchange is weaker\nthan in the respective molecular case. The weaker suppression is explained by a\nlarger binding energy and respectively smaller size of the hadrocharmonium\npentaquarks. These results combined with the experimental data on partial decay\nwidths could allow to figure out which of the two theoretical scenarios for\npentaquarks (if either) is chosen by nature. \n\n"}

The evolution of the CC depends on the single\nparameter \\nu, which characterizes the running of the CC produced by the\nquantum effects of matter fields of the unknown high energy theory below the\nPlanck scale. The sign of \\nu indicates whether bosons or fermions dominate in\nthe running. The spectrum of perturbations is computed assuming an adiabatic\nregime and an isotropic stress tensor. Moreover, the perturbations of the CC\nterm are generated from the simplest covariant form suggested by the RG model\nunder consideration. The corresponding numerical analysis shows that for \\nu>0\nthere is a depletion of the matter power spectrum at low scales (large wave\nnumbers) as compared to the standard LCDM model, whereas for \\nu<0 there is an\nexcess of power at low scales.

Such a\ntrigger strongly reduces the effective impact parameters as compared to minimum\nbias events. This happens because the transverse spatial distribution of hard\npartons (x >~ 10^{-2}) in the proton is considerably narrower than that of soft\npartons, whose collisions dominate the total cross section. In the central\ncollisions selected by the trigger, most of the partons with x >~ 10^{-2}\ninteract with a gluon field whose strength rapidly increases with energy.

Our\ntheoretical analysis is based on the color dipole approach in the target rest\nframe, which has provided a successful phenomenological description of a\nvariety of hadronic reactions. The present application is relevant to the\nregime of short coherence length (SCL), where the spatial extent of the\nfluctuations of the projectile responsible for the Drell-Yan reaction is short\ncompared to the internucleon spacing. In this limit, momentum broadening comes\nfrom initial state interactions and is described as color filtering, i.e.\nabsorption of large-size dipoles leading to diminished transverse separation\nand hence enhanced transverse momentum. The predictions we present are in good\nagreement with the E866 data.

If a flaton field is trapped at the origin in the early\nuniverse, one expects `thermal inflation' to take place before it rolls away to\nthe true vacuum, because the finite-temperature correction to the potential\nwill hold it at the origin until the temperature falls below $1\\TeV$ or so. In\nthe first part of the paper, that expectation is confirmed by an estimate of\nthe finite temperature corrections and of the tunneling rate to the true\nvacuum, paying careful attention to the validity of the approximations that are\nused. The second part of the paper considers topological defects which may be\nproduced at the end of an era of thermal inflation. If the flaton fields\nassociated with the era are GUT higgs fields, then its end corresponds to the\nGUT phase transition. In that case monopoles (as well as GUT higgs particles)\nwill have to be diluted by a second era of thermal inflation.

Because of the flat Higgs potential, the GUT\nsymmetry breaking scale required for the strings to be a candidate for the\norigin of large scale structure and the cmb anisotropy is about three times\nbigger than usual, but given the uncertainties it is still compatible with the\none required by the unification of the Standard Model gauge couplings.

{"id": "hep-ph/9707540", "contents": "Title: Electroweak Baryogenesis Using Baryon Number Carrying Scalars Abstract: We describe a new mechanism for the generation of the baryon asymmetry of the\nuniverse during a first order electroweak phase transition. The mechanism\nrequires the existence of two (or more) baryon number carrying scalar fields\nwith masses and CP violating mixing which vary with the Higgs field expectation\nvalue. This mechanism can be implemented using squarks in supersymmetric\ntheories or using leptoquarks. Our central observation is that reflection of\nthese scalars from a bubble wall can yield a significant net baryon number flux\ninto the symmetric phase, balanced by a flux of opposite sign into the broken\nphase. For generic parameter choices, scalars with incident energies in a\nspecific, but not narrow, range yield order one reflection asymmetries (between\nthe probability of reflection of the scalars and of their antiparticles). The\ninteresting energies are those for which there are two propagating scalars in\nthe symmetric phase but only one in the broken phase. Electroweak sphaleron\nprocesses drive the baryon number in the symmetric phase toward zero, but do\nnot act in the broken phase.

In supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, distinct\nconfined phases may coexist with a Coulomb phase at zero temperature. In that\ncase, the Coulomb phase may completely wet a confined-confined interface.\nFinally, at the high-temperature phase transition of gluons and gluinos,\nconfined-confined interfaces are completely wet by the deconfined phase, and\nsimilarly, deconfined-deconfined interfaces are completely wet by the confined\nphase. For these various cases, we determine the interface profiles and the\ncorresponding complete wetting critical exponents. The exponents depend on the\nrange of the interface interactions and agree with those of corresponding\ncondensed matter systems. \n\n"}

To begin with, we study this phenomenon both\nnumerically and, with some approximations, analytically within the rainbow\napproximation in the Landau gauge. In particular, we discuss how to extract the\ncritical coupling alpha_c = pi/3 relevant in four dimensions from the D\ndimensional theory.

In the case of two branes of opposite tension,\nlinearized Brans-Dicke (BD) gravity is recovered on either wall, with different\nBD parameters. On the wall with positive tension the BD parameter is larger\nthan 3000 provided that the separation between walls is larger than 4 times the\nAdS radius. For the wall of negative tension, the BD parameter is always\nnegative but greater than -3/2. In either case, shadow matter from the other\nwall gravitates upon us. For equal Newtonian mass, light deflection from shadow\nmatter is 25 % weaker than from ordinary matter. Hence, the effective mass of a\nclustered object containing shadow dark matter would be underestimated if\nnaively measured through its lensing effect. For the case of a single wall of\npositive tension, Einstein gravity is recovered on the wall to leading order,\nand if the source is stationary the field stays localized near the wall. We\ncalculate the leading Kaluza-Klein corrections to the linearized gravitational\nfield of a non-relativistic spherical object and find that the metric is\ndifferent from the Schwarzschild solution at large distances.

The relativistic bound state problem for three quarks is considered.\nDiquarks are introduced as separable correlations in the two-quark correlation\nfunction and thereby baryons are described by a Bethe-Salpeter equation for\nbound states of quark and diquark which interact by quark exchange. In analogy\nto the meson spectrum, scalar and axialvector diquarks are considered to be the\nmost important two-quark configurations within baryons. The numerical solutions\nof the covariant Bethe-Salpeter equation are subsequently employed in the\ncalculation of electromagnetic, strong and axial form factors of the nucleons.\nThe construction of the electromagnetic current operator in the diquark-quark\nmodel respects gauge invariance. Invariance under chiral symmetry\ntransformations is slightly violated for vector diquarks have been neglected,\nleading to a modest violation of the Goldberger-Treiman relation. The\npossibility of an effective parametrization of confinement by suitable\nmodifications of the quark and diquark propagators is investigated.
