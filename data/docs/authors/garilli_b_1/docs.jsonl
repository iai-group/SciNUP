We contrast a model of Cold Dark Matter and a Cosmological\nConstant (LCDM) with an Open CDM (OCDM) model with the same matter density\nOmega_m =0.3 and the same Hubble constant h=0.7. Already by the time the scale\nfactor increased by a factor of 6 (29 Gyr from now in LCDM; 78 Gyr from now in\nOCDM) the comoving position of the Local Group is frozen. Well before that\nepoch the two most massive members of the Local Group, the Milky Way and\nAndromeda, will merge. However, as the expansion rates of the scale factor in\nthe two models are different, the Local Group will be receding in physical\ncoordinates from Virgo exponentially in a LCDM model and at a roughly constant\nvelocity in an OCDM model. More generally, in comoving coordinates the future\nlarge scale structure will look like a sharpened image of the present\nstructure: the skeleton of the cosmic web will remain the same, but clusters\nwill be more `isolated' and the filaments will become thinner. This implies\nthat the long-term fate of large scale structure as seen in comoving\ncoordinates is determined primarily by the matter density. We conclude that\nalthough the LCDM model is accelerating at present due to its Dark Energy\ncomponent while the OCDM model is non accelerating, their large scale structure\nin the future will look very similar in comoving coordinates. \n\n"}

Using the latest results on the cohesive property of magnetic condensed\nmatter, we quantitatively determine the conditions for surface condensation and\nvacuum gap formation in magnetic neutron stars. We find that condensation can\noccur if the thermal energy kT of the neutron star surface is less than about\n8% of its cohesive energy Q_s, and that a vacuum gap can form if the neutron\nstar's rotation axis and magnetic moment point in opposite directions and kT is\nless than about 4% of Q_s. Thus, vacuum gap accelerators may exist for some\nneutron stars.

However, these observations are\nchallenging because the low space densities of these objects necessitate\nsurveying of large areas, in order to obtain statistically meaningful samples,\nwhile at the same time cosmological redshifting and dimming means that rather\ndeep Near Infrared (NIR) imaging must be carried out. Several upcoming and\nproposed facilities with wide-field NIR imaging capabilities will open up this\nnew region of parameter space. In this paper we present predictions for the\nexpected number counts of z>5 QSOs, based on simple empirical and\nsemi-empirical models of QSO evolution, as a function of redshift, depth and\nsurveyed area. We compute the evolution of observed-frame QSO magnitudes and\ncolors in a representative photometric system covering the wavelength range\n550nm<lambda<1800nm, and combine this information with different estimates for\nthe evolution of the QSO luminosity function. We conclude that planned\nground-based surveys such as Pan-STARRS and VISTA should be able to detect a\nlarge number of luminous QSOs up to z<7.5, but that space-based missions such\nas EUCLID (formerly SPACE/DUNE) or SNAP are probably required in order to\nobtain substantial samples at higher redshift.

The accretion rate\nonto the black hole adjusts so that the luminosity carried by the convective\nenvelope equals the Eddington limit for the total mass. This greatly exceeds\nthe Eddington limit for the black hole mass alone, leading to rapid growth of\nthe black hole. We use analytic models and numerical stellar structure\ncalculations to study the structure and evolution of quasistars. We derive\nanalytically the scaling of the photospheric temperature with the black hole\nmass and envelope mass, and show that it decreases with time as the black hole\nmass increases. Once the photospheric temperature becomes lower than 10,000 K,\nthe photospheric opacity drops precipitously and the photospheric temperature\nhits a limiting value, analogous to the Hayashi track for red giants and\nprotostars, below which no hydrostatic solution for the convective envelope\nexists.

To calculate the modified observable\ndistance-redshift relations, we introduce a generalized Dyer-Roeder method that\nallows for two crucial physical properties of the universe: inhomogeneities in\nthe expansion rate and the growth of the nonlinear structures. By treating the\ntransition redshift to the void-dominated era as a free parameter, we find a\nphenomenological fit to the observations from the CMB anisotropy, the position\nof the baryon oscillation peak, the magnitude-redshift relations of type Ia\nsupernovae, the local Hubble flow and the nucleosynthesis, resulting in a\nconcordant model of the universe with 90% dark matter, 10% baryons, no dark\nenergy, 15 Gyr as the age of the universe and a natural value for the\ntransition redshift z_0=0.35. Unlike a large local void, the model respects the\ncosmological principle, further offering an explanation for the late onset of\nthe perceived acceleration as a consequence of the forming nonlinear\nstructures. Additional tests, such as quantitative predictions for angular\ndeviations due to an anisotropic void distribution and a theoretical derivation\nof the model, can vindicate or falsify the interpretation that light\npropagation in voids is responsible for the perceived acceleration. \n\n"}

(Methods) We compare the\nmorphological and kinematic properties of J033239.72-275154.7, the latter\nobtained by the GIRAFFE spectrograph, to those derived from the merger of two\nspiral galaxies described by idealized N-body simulations including a star\nformation prescription. (Results) We found that the general morphological shape\nand most of the dynamical properties of the object can be well reproduced by a\nmodel in which the satellite is initially put in a retrograde orbit and the\nmass ratio of the system is 1:3. In such a scenario, a bar forms in the host\ngalaxy after the first passage of the satellite where an important fraction of\navailable gas is consumed in an induced burst. In its later evolution, however,\nwe find that J033239.72-275154.7, whose major progenitor was an Sab galaxy,\nwill probably become a S0 galaxy.

We find that the Universe does not reheat immediately through\nperturbative decays, but rather initiate a complex process in which\nperturbative and non-perturbative effects are mixed. The Higgs condesate starts\noscillating around the minimum of its potential, producing W and Z gauge bosons\nnon-perturbatively, due to violation of the so-called adiabaticity condition.\nHowever, during each semi-oscillation, the created gauge bosons completely\ndecay (perturbatively) into fermions. This way, the decay of the gauge bosons\nprevents the development of parametric resonance, since bosons cannot\naccummulate significantly at the beginning. However, the energy transferred to\nthe decay products of the bosons is not enough to reheat the universe, so after\nabout a hundred oscillations, the resonance effect will finally dominate over\nthe perturbative decays. Around the same time (or slightly earlier),\nbackreaction from the gauge bosons onto the Higgs condensate will also start to\nbe significant. Soon afterwards, the Universe is filled with the remnant\ncondensate of the Higgs and a non-thermal distribution of Standard Model\nparticles which redshift as radiation, while the Higgs continues to oscillate\nas a pressureless fluid.

Despite the evolved stellar populations contained within DRGs at\nz=2.3, 90% of satellite galaxies in the DRG luminosity range have been accreted\nwithin 500 Myr. Thus, satellite DRGs must have known they would become\nsatellites well before the time of their accretion.

In this work, we present an all sky computation of angular power\nspectrum of the temperature anisotropies introduced by kSZ momentum of all\nbaryons in the Universe during and after reionization. In an attempt to study\nthe bulk flows of the missing baryons not yet detected, we address separately\nthe contribution from all baryons in the IGM and those baryons located in\ncollapsed structures like groups and clusters of galaxies. In the first case,\nour approach provides a complete, all sky computation of the kSZ in second\norder of cosmological perturbation theory (also known as the Ostriker-Vishniac\neffect, OV). Most of the power of OV is generated during reionization, although\nit has a non-negligible tail at low redshifts, when the bulk of the kSZ\npeculiar momentum of the halo (cluster + group) population arises.

Fast rotation of the cores\nenables a two-stage collapse scenario, implying the formation of a spinar-like\nobject. A burst produced by such a collapse consists of two pulses, whose\nenergy budget is enough to explain observed GRBs. We calculate models of spinar\nevolution using results from a population synthesis of binary systems (done by\nthe `Scenario Machine') as initial parameters for the rotating massive cores.\nAmong the resulting bursts, events with the weaker first peak, namely,\nprecursor, are identified, and the precursor-to-main-pulse time separations\nfully agree with the range of the observed values. The calculated fraction of\nlong GRBs with precursor (about 10 per cent of the total number of long GRBs)\nand the durations of the main pulses are also consistent with observations.\nPrecursors with lead times greater by up to one order of magnitude than those\nobserved so far are expected to be about twice less numerous.

In the ICP the entropy run k(r) is mainly shaped by shocks, as\nsteadily set by supersonic accretion of gas at the cluster boundary, and\nintermittently driven from the center by merging events or by AGNs; the\nresulting equilibrium is described by the exact yet simple formalism\nconstituting our ICP Supermodel.

In fact, the addition of a new contribution accounting for the\ngas can increase the statistical significance of the lensing model. We propose\na parametric method for strong lensing analyses which exploits multi-wavelength\nobservations. The mass model accounts for cluster-sized dark matter halos,\ngalaxies (whose stellar mass can be obtained from optical analyses) and the\nintracluster medium. The gas distribution is fitted to lensing data exploiting\nprior knowledge from X-ray observations. This gives an unbiased look at each\nmatter component and allows us to study the dynamical status of a cluster.}The\nmethod has been applied to AC 114, an irregular X-ray cluster. We find positive\nevidence for dynamical activity, with the dark matter distribution shifted and\nrotated with respect to the gas. On the other hand, the dark matter follows the\ngalaxy density both for shape and orientation, which hints at its collisionless\nnature. The inner region (< 250kpc) is under-luminous in optical bands whereas\nthe gas fraction (~20+- 5%) slightly exceeds typical values.

Previous results\nhave confirmed that a non-negligible fraction of old main-sequence stars is\npresent in the lists of possible members of young stellar kinematic groups. A\ndetailed study of the properties of these samples is needed to separate the\nyoung stars from old main-sequence stars with similar space motion, and\nidentify the origin of these structures. We used stars possible members of the\nyoung (~ 10 - 650 Myr) moving groups from the literature. To determine the age\nof the stars, we used several suitable age indicators for young main sequence\nstars, i.e., X-ray fluxes and other photometric data. We also used\nspectroscopic data, in particular the equivalent width of the lithium line Li I\nand Halpha, to constrain the range of ages of the stars. By combining\nphotometric and spectroscopic data, we were able to separate the young stars\n(10 - 650 Myr) from the old (> 1 Gyr) field ones.

From new\nhigh-resolution spectra of 17 sub-DLAs we have increased the number of\nmeasurements of [Fe/H] at z<1.7 by 25% and compiled the most complete\nliterature sample of sub-DLA and DLA abundances to date.

We also present the first evidence that sub-DLAs follow a velocity\nwidth-metallicity correlation over the same velocity range as DLAs, but the\nrelation is offset to higher metallicities than the DLA relation. On the basis\nof these results, we revisit the previous explanation that the systematically\nhigher metallicities observed in sub-DLAs are indicative of higher host galaxy\nmasses.

We\nmake use of the fact that the physics of interactions is not included in the\nsemianalytic model, to infer that any difference between the mock control and\npair samples can be ascribed to selection biases. Thus, we find that galaxies\nin pairs artificially tend to be older and more bulge-dominated, and to have\nless cold gas and different metallicities than their isolated counterparts.\nAlso because of a biased selection, galaxies in pairs tend to live in higher\ndensity environments, and in haloes of larger masses.

Using these iodine exposures to calibrate the\nnormal Th-Ar Keck data pipeline output we found absolute wavelength offsets of\n500 m/s to 1000 m/s with drifts of more than 500 m/s over a single night, and\ndrifts of nearly 2000 m/s over several nights. These offsets correspond to an\nabsolute redshift of uncertainty of about Delta z=10^{-5} (Delta lambda= 0.02\nAng), with daily drifts of around Delta z=5x10^{-6} (Delta lambda =0.01 Ang),\nand multiday drifts of nearly Delta z=2x10^{-5} (0.04 Ang).

While in maximally symmetric spaces ghost-like instabilities\nare inevitable, they can be avoided in a FRW background. The phases with less\nthan two DOF in the scalar sector are also studied. Curvature allows an\ninteresting interplay with the mass parameters; in particular, we have extended\nthe Higuchi bound of dS to FRW and Lorentz breaking masses. As in dS, when the\nbound is saturated there is no propagating DOF in the scalar sector.

Since they\nare large in number, they contribute significantly to the cosmic matter cycle.\nTo assess this contribution quantitatively, it is crucial to obtain a detailed\npicture of the stellar interior, particularly with regard to nucleosynthesis\nand mixing mechanisms. We seek to benchmark stellar evolutionary models of\nlow-mass stars. In particular, we measure the surface abundance of ^{12}C in\nthermally pulsing AGB stars with well-known mass and metallicity, which can be\nused to infer information about the onset and efficiency of the third\ndredge-up. We recorded high-resolution near-infrared spectra of AGB stars in\nthe LMC cluster NGC 1978. The sample comprised both oxygen-rich and carbon-rich\nstars, and is well-constrained in terms of the stellar mass, metallicity, and\nage. We derived the C/O and ^{12}C/^{13}C ratio from the target spectra by a\ncomparison to synthetic spectra. Then, we compared the outcomes of stellar\nevolutionary models with our measurements. The M stars in NGC 1978 show values\nof C/O and ^{12}C/^{13}C that can best be explained with moderate extra-mixing\non the RGB coupled to a moderate oxygen enhancement in the chemical\ncomposition.

Within growing neutrino\nmodels the coupling becomes effective only in recent times, when neutrinos\nbecome non-relativistic, stopping the evolution of the cosmon. This can explain\nwhy dark energy dominates the universe only in a rather recent epoch by\nrelating the present dark energy density to the small mass of neutrinos. Such\nmodels predict the presence of stable neutrino lumps at supercluster scales\n(~200 Mpc and bigger), caused by an attractive force between neutrinos which is\nstronger than gravity and mediated by the cosmon. We present a method to follow\nthe initial non-linear formation of neutrino lumps in physical space, by\nintegrating numerically on a 3D grid non-linear evolution equations, until\nvirialization naturally occurs. As a first application, we show results for\ncosmologies with final large neutrino average mass ~2 eV: in this case,\nneutrino lumps indeed form and mimic very large cold dark matter structures,\nwith a typical gravitational potential 10^{-5} for a lump size ~10 Mpc, and\nreaching larger values for lumps of about 200 Mpc.

The strongest practical\nlimitation for these experiments is how quickly accurate redshifts can be\nmeasured for sufficient galaxies to map the large-scale structure. A promising\nstrategy is to target emission-line (i.e. star-forming) galaxies at\nhigh-redshift (z~0.5-2); not only is the space density of this population\nincreasing out to z~2, but also emission-lines provide an efficient method of\nredshift determination.

The AD mechanism predicts the formation of non-topological solitons,\nQ-balls, from which GWs are generated. Q-balls with large conserved charge $Q$\ncan produce a large amount of GWs. On the other hand, the decay rate of such\nQ-balls is so small that they may dominate the energy density of the universe,\nwhich implies that GWs are significantly diluted and that their frequencies are\nredshifted during Q-ball dominated era.

Considerations of cosmology in the BIMOND framework suggest that such\nTM might exist and copy matter in its attributes. Here I investigate the\nindirect interactions that BIMOND theories predict between nonrelativistic\nmasses of matter and TM. The most salient result is that in the deep-MOND\nregime of the matter-TM-symmetric theories, TM behaves as if it has a negative\ngravitational mass. To wit, interaction within each sector is attractive MOND\ngravity, but between matter and TM it is repulsive MOND gravity. In the\nhigh-acceleration regime, the interaction depends on a parameter, beta. For the\nfavored value beta=1, matter and TM do not interact in this regime; for beta<1\nthey attract; and for beta>1 they repel each other. Such interactions may have\nsubstantial ramifications for all aspects of structure formation, such as\nmatter distribution, peculiar velocities, and effects on the CMB. The repulsive\ninteractions probably lead to segregation of matter and TM structures, leading,\nin turn, to intermeshing of the respective cosmic webs, with high-density nodes\nof one sector residing in the voids of the other (possibly conducing to\nefficient evacuation of the voids). Weak lensing by TM seems the best way to\nconstrain its attributes. In the MOND regime a TM body acts on matter photons\nas a diverging lens. Strong lensing occurs in the high acceleration regime, and\nthus depends on the value of beta. For beta=1 no strong lensing effects of TM\nare expected.

The low-velocity system required also two absorbing components, one\nwith temperature of 5.8X10^5K; the other with lower temperature (3.5X10^4K).\nOnce these components are considered, the data do not require any further\nabsorbers.

In\nthis case, a lack of polarization is expected in the region of the spot, as\ncompared to the typical values associated to large fluctuations of a GIRF.

However, some of these\nalternative scenarios (e.g., a large void in the large scale structure) have\nbeen shown to be very unlikely. In this work we characterise the polarization\nproperties of the Cold Spot under both hypotheses: a large Gaussian spot and an\nanomalous feature generated, for instance, by a cosmic texture.

Although the process of condensation\nof scalar fields in the lab is fairly well understood, the extension of results\nto a cosmological context is not trivial. Here we investigate the formation of\na condensate - a classical scalar field - after reheating of the Universe. We\nassume a light quantum scalar field produced by the decay of a heavy particle,\nwhich for simplicity is assumed to be another scalar. We show that during\nradiation domination epoch under certain conditions, the decay of the heavy\nparticle alone is sufficient for the production of a condensate. This process\nis very similar to preheating - the exponential particle production at the end\nof inflation. During matter domination epoch when the expansion of the Universe\nis faster, the decay alone can not keep the growing trend of the field and the\namplitude of the condensate decreases rapidly, unless there is a self\ninteraction. This issue is particularly important for dark energy. We show that\nquantum corrections of the self-interaction play a crucial role in this\nprocess. Notably, they induce an effective action which includes inverse\npower-law terms, and therefore can lead to a tracking behaviour even when the\nclassical self-interaction is a simple power-law of order 3 or 4.

Methods: We calculate the neutrino flux from $\\beta$\nprocesses using nuclear statistical equilibrium abundances convoluted with\napproximate neutrino spectra of the individual nuclei and the thermal neutrino\nspectrum (pair+plasma). Results: Although the two considered thermonuclear\nsupernova explosion scenarios are expected to produce almost identical\nelectromagnetic output, their neutrino signatures appear vastly different,\nwhich allow an unambiguous identification of the explosion mechanism: a pure\ndeflagration produces a single peak in the neutrino light curve, while the\naddition of the second maximum characterizes a delayed-detonation. We\nidentified the following main contributors to the neutrino signal: (1) weak\nelectron neutrino emission from electron captures (in particular on the protons\nCo55 and Ni56) and numerous beta-active nuclei produced by the thermonuclear\nflame and/or detonation front, (2) electron antineutrinos from positron\ncaptures on neutrons, and (3) the thermal emission from pair annihilation. We\nestimate that a pure deflagration supernova explosion at a distance of 1 kpc\nwould trigger about 14 events in the future 50 kt liquid scintillator detector\nand some 19 events in a 0.5 Mt water Cherenkov-type detector. Conclusions:\nWhile in contrast to core-collapse supernovae neutrinos carry only a very small\nfraction of the energy produced in the thermonuclear supernova explosion, the\nSN Ia neutrino signal provides information that allows us to unambiguously\ndistinguish between different possible explosion scenarios.

In tandem with these geometrical constraints, redshift-space\ndistortions (RSD) depend on the build up of large-scale structure. As pointed\nout by many authors measurements of these effects are intrinsically coupled. We\ninvestigate this link, and argue that it strongly depends on the cosmological\nassumptions adopted when analysing data.

We compile recent measurements of\nthe Type-Ia SN (SN Ia) rate in galaxy clusters at redshifts z=0-1.45.

We test DTD models from the\nliterature, requiring that they simultaneously reproduce the observed cluster\nSN rates and the observed iron-to-stellar mass ratios. A power-law DTD of the\nform t^{-1.2+/-0.3}, extending to a Hubble time, can satisfy both constraints.\nShallower power laws, such as t^{-1/2} cannot, assuming a single DTD, and a\nsingle star-formation burst (either brief or extended) at high z.

Here we examine the distribution of various physical\nproperties as a function of r of 1040 luminous radio galaxies (RGs) at z<0.3\nfrom the SDSS, NVSS, and FIRST. About 2/3 of the RGs are lobe-dominated (LD),\nand 1/3 have prominent jets. If we follow the original definition of the FR\ntypes (a division based solely on r), FR I and FR II RGs overlap in their host\ngalaxy properties. However, the rare, LD sources with r>0.8 AND OIII5007 line\nluminosity >10^6 Lsun are markedly different on average from the rest of the\nRGs, in the sense that they are hosted in lower mass galaxies, live in\nrelatively sparse environments, and have higher accretion rates onto the\ncentral SMBH. Thus these objects and the rest of RGs form a well-defined\ndichotomy. Motivated by the stark differences in the nuclear emission line\nproperties of the RG subsamples, we suggest that the accretion rate onto the\nSMBH may play the primary role in creating the different morphologies. At\nrelatively high accretion rates, the accretion system may produce powerful jets\nthat create the \"classical double\" morphology (roughly corresponding to the LD\nsources with r>0.8 and emission lines); at lower accretion rates the jets from\na radiatively inefficient accretion flow generate radio lobes without apparent\n\"hot spots\" at the edge (corresponding to the majority of LD sources). At\nslightly lower accretion rates AND in galaxies with dense galactic structure,\nsources with prominent jets result. It is possible that while the high\naccretion rate systems could affect sub-Mpc scale environments, the jets from\nlower accretion rate systems may efficiently suppress activity within the host\ngalaxies. \n\n"}

We supplement these with archival data\nin the B, J, H, and K bands. We use the 8um, 24um and FUV (1500\\AA) emission to\nstudy the star formation rate (SFR). We find that globally, these tracers of\nstar formation give a range of results of ~6-11\\msun/yr, with the\ndust-corrected FUV giving the highest value of SFR. We can reconcile the UV and\nIR-based estimates by adopting a steeper UV extinction curve that lies in\nbetween the starburst (Calzetti) and SMC extinction curves. However, the\nregions of highest SFR intensity along the spiral arms are consistent with a\nstarburst-like extinction. Overall, the level of star-formation we find is\nhigher than previously published for this galaxy, by about a factor of two,\nwhich, contrary to previous conclusions, implies that the interaction that\ncaused the distorted morphology of NGC2442 likely also triggered increased\nlevels of star-formation activity. Outside of the spiral arms, we discover what\nappears to be a superbubble, ~1.7kpc across in the IRAC images. Significant\nH{\\alpha}, UV and IR emission in the area also suggest vigorous ongoing\nstar-formation. A known, recent supernova (SN1999ga) is located at the edge of\nthis superbubble. Although speculative at this stage, this area suggests a\nlarge star-forming region with a morphology shaped by generations of\nsupernovae. Lastly, we discover an 8um (PAH) circumnuclear ring with an ~0.8kpc\nradius. The H{\\alpha} emission is largely concentrated inside that ring and\nshows a vague spiral structure in the rest of the galaxy. \n\n"}

Abstract: For early-type galaxies, the correlations between stellar mass and size,\nvelocity dispersion, surface brightness, color, axis ratio and color-gradient\nall indicate that two mass scales, M* = 3 x 10^10 Msun and M* = 2 x 10^11 Msun,\nare special. The smaller scale could mark the transition between wet and dry\nmergers, or it could be related to the interplay between SN and AGN feedback,\nalthough quantitative measures of this transition may be affected by\nmorphological contamination. At the more massive scale, mean axis ratios and\ncolor gradients are maximal, and above it, the colors are redder, the sizes\nlarger and the velocity dispersions smaller than expected based on the scaling\nat lower M*. In contrast, the color-sigma relation, and indeed, most scaling\nrelations with sigma, are not curved: they are well-described by a single power\nlaw, or in some cases, are almost completely flat. When major dry mergers\nchange masses, sizes, axis ratios and color gradients, they are expected to\nchange the colors or velocity dispersions much less. Therefore, the fact that\nscaling relations at sigma > 150 km/s show no features, whereas the size-M*,\nb/a-M*, color-M* and color gradient-M* relations do, suggests that M* = 2 x\n10^11 Msun is the scale above which major dry mergers dominate the assembly\nhistories of early-type galaxies. \n\n"}

In particular, we define and study the\nfraction of blue BCGs, namely those that are likely to be missed by either\ncolour-based cluster surveys and catalogues. Richer clusters tend to have\nbrighter BCGs, however less dominant than in poorer systems. 4-9% of our BCGs\nare at least 0.3 mag bluer in the g-r colour than the red-sequence at their\ngiven redshift. Such a fraction decreases to 1-6% for clusters above a richness\nof 50, where 3% of the BCGs are 0.5 mag below the red-sequence. A preliminary\nmorphological study suggests that the increase in the blue fraction at lower\nrichnesses may have a non-negligible contribution from spiral galaxies.

Roughly\n10% of our objects are best explained by binary AGNs at (projected) kpc-scale\nseparations, where two stellar components with spatially coincident NLRs are\nseen. ~ 50% of our objects have [OIII] emission offset by a few kpc,\ncorresponding to the two velocity components seen in the SDSS spectra, but\nthere are no corresponding double stellar components seen in the NIR imaging.\nFor those objects with sufficiently high quality slit spectra, we see velocity\nand/or velocity dispersion gradients in [OIII] emission, suggestive of the\nkinematic signatures of a single NLR. The remaining ~40% of our objects are\nambiguous, and will need higher spatial resolution observations to distinguish\nbetween the two scenarios. Our observations therefore favor the kinematics\nscenario with a single AGN for the majority of these double-peaked [OIII] type\n2 AGNs.

In Paper I of this series, we selected a sample\nof AGN pairs with projected separations r_p < 100 kpc and velocity offsets <\n600 km/s from the SDSS DR7 and quantified their frequency. In this paper, we\naddress the BH accretion and recent star formation properties in their host\ngalaxies. AGN pairs experience stronger BH accretion, as measured by their [O\nIII]5007 luminosities (corrected for contribution from star formation) and\nEddington ratios, than do control samples of single AGNs matched in redshift\nand host stellar mass. Their host galaxies have stronger post-starburst\nactivity and younger mean stellar ages, as indicated by stronger H-delta\nabsorption and smaller 4000 A break in their spectra. The BH accretion and\nrecent star formation in the host galaxies both increase with decreasing\nprojected separation in AGN pairs, for r_p ~< 10-30 kpc. The intensity of BH\naccretion, the post-starburst strength, and the mean stellar ages are\ncorrelated between the two AGNs in a pair. The luminosities and Eddington\nratios of AGN pairs are correlated with recent star formation in their host\ngalaxies, with a scaling relation consistent with that observed in single AGNs.\nOur results suggest that galaxy tidal interactions enhance both BH accretion\nand star formation in AGN pairs, even though the majority of low redshift AGNs\nis not coincident with on-going interactions. \n\n"}

Here we\ndiscuss the possibility that the high surface brightnesses observed are not due\nto star formation, but due to cosmological gas accretion. We assume that all of\nthe accretion energy is dissipated as shocks from the accreting gas. We show\nthat in order to explain the high surface brightnesses both the mass accretion\nrate and energy would have to be much higher than expected from simulations or\nfrom equating the star formation with the accretion rate. We also investigate\nscaling relations between the surface brightness expected from accretion and\nfor star formation through mechanical heating and photo-ionization, trying to\nidentify a regime where such accretion may become evident in galaxies.\nUnfortunately, the surface brightness necessary to detect the gas in optical\nline emission is about an order of magnitude lower than what has currently been\nachieved with near-infrared observations of distant galaxies. \n\n"}

This\nV=27 galaxy appears to give us unprecedented insights into two fundamental\nstages in the formation of structure at high redshift: the inflow of gas into\nordinary galaxies, and the escape of ionizing radiation into the intergalactic\nmedium. Neutral hydrogen, falling in partly in form of a narrow filament,\nappears to emit fluorescent Lyman alpha photons induced by the stellar ionizing\nflux escaping from the disturbed galaxy.

We collect and\nexploit these data in order to measure from the spectral energy distributions\n(SEDs) precisely how much stellar radiation is intercepted and re-radiated by\ndust, and how this quantity varies with galaxy properties. By including SPIRE\ndata, we are more sensitive to emission from cold dust grains than previous\nanalyses at shorter wavelengths, allowing for more accurate estimates of dust\ntemperatures and masses.\n  The dust/stellar flux ratio, which we measure by integrating the SEDs, has a\nrange of nearly three decades. The inclusion of SPIRE data shows that estimates\nbased on data not reaching these far-IR wavelengths are biased low. We find\nthat the dust/stellar flux ratio varies with morphology and total IR\nluminosity. We also find that dust/stellar flux ratios are related to gas-phase\nmetallicity, while the dust/stellar mass ratios are less so. The substantial\nscatter between dust/stellar flux and dust/stellar mass indicates that the\nformer is a poor proxy of the latter. Comparing the dust/stellar flux ratios\nand dust temperatures, we show that early-types tend to have slightly warmer\ntemperatures than spiral galaxies, which may be due to more intense\ninterstellar radiation fields, or to different dust grain compositions.\nFinally, we show that early-types and early-type spirals have a strong\ncorrelation between the dust/stellar flux ratio and specific star formation\nrate, which suggests that the relatively bright far-IR emission of some of\nthese galaxies is due to ongoing star formation and the radiation field from\nolder stars. \n\n"}

The best\ntheoretical recipes available nowadays in literature to estimate the amount of\ndust produced by SNae and AGB stars have been discussed and for SNae compared\nto the observations to get clues on the problem.

We exploit deep WFC3 IR observations of the ERS and HUDF fields over\nGOODS-South, combined with HST-ACS optical data, to select z~4 LBGs through a\nnew (B-V) vs. (V-H) colour diagram. The UV slope of the selected galaxies is\nrobustly determined by a linear fit over their observed I, Z, Y, J magnitudes,\ncoherently with the original definition of beta. The same fit is used to\ndetermine their rest-frame UV magnitudes M1600 through a simple interpolation.\nWe estimate the effect of observational uncertainties with detailed simulations\nthat we also exploit, under a parametric maximum-likelihood approach, to\nconstrain the probability density function of UV slopes PDF(beta) as a function\nof rest-frame magnitude.

We find an intrinsic dispersion ~ 0.3\nfor PDF(beta) at all magnitudes. The SFRD at z~4 corrected according to these\nestimates turns out to be lower than previously found: log(SFRD)\\simeq-1.09\nM_sun/yr/Mpc^3.

Our\nbest fit results for the evolution factor E(z)^alpha are alpha = -1.04+-0.07\nfor the M-T relation, alpha = -0.23+0.12-0.62 for the L-T relation, and alpha =\n-0.93+0.62-0.12 for the M-L_X relation.

Variations in the mean\nstrength of the solar magnetic field lead to significant shifts in the\nfrequencies of even the lowest-degree p modes with high levels of correlation\nwith surface activity proxies.

However,\nclear differences between p-mode frequencies and surface activity during the\nextended minimum of cycle 23 were observed. The origin of the p-mode\nvariability is thus far from being properly understood and a better\ncomprehension of its relationship with solar and stellar activity cycles will\nhelp us in our understanding of the dynamo processes.

Giant\nclumps of 10^8-9 Msun arise from violent gravitational instability in gas-rich\ngalaxies, and it has been proposed that this instability could feed\nsupermassive black holes (BH). We use emission line diagnostics to compare a\nsample of 14 clumpy (unstable) disks and a sample of 13 smoother (stable) disks\nat redshift z~0.7. The majority of clumpy disks in our sample have a high\nprobability of containing AGN. Their [OIII] emission line is strongly excited,\ninconsistent with low-metallicity star formation alone. [NeIII] excitation is\nalso higher. Stable disks rarely have such properties. Stacking ultra sensitive\nChandra observations (4 Ms) reveals an X-ray excess in clumpy galaxies, which\ncannot be solely due to star formation and confirms the presence of AGN. The\nclumpy galaxies in our intermediate-redshift sample have properties typical of\ngas-rich disk galaxies rather than mergers, being in particular on the Main\nSequence of star formation. This suggests that our findings apply to the\nphysically-similar and numerous gas-rich unstable disks at z>1.

We find that, as the gas cools, the cluster develops a very flat\ntemperature profile, undergoing a cooling catastrophe only in the central\n10-100 pc of the cluster. Outside of this region, the flow is smooth, with no\nlocal cooling instabilities, and naturally produces very little low-temperature\ngas (below a few keV), in agreement with observations. The gas cooling in the\ncenter of the cluster rapidly forms a thin accretion disk. The amount of cold\ngas produced at the very center grows rapidly until a reasonable estimate of\nthe resulting AGN heating rate (assuming even a moderate accretion efficiency)\nwould overwhelm cooling. We argue that this naturally produces a thermostat\nwhich links the cooling of gas out to 100 kpc with the cold gas accretion in\nthe central 100 pc, potentially closing the loop between cooling and heating.\nIsotropic heat conduction does not affect the result significantly, but we show\nthat including the potential well of the brightest cluster galaxy is necessary\nto obtain the correct result.

II.\n  Episodic formation of broad line regions Abstract: (abridged) We study the consequence of star formation (SF) in an self-gravity\ndominated accretion disk in quasars. The warm skins of the SF disk are governed\nby the radiation from the inner part of the accretion disk to form Compton\natmosphere (CAS). The CAS are undergoing four phases to form broad line\nregions. Phase I is the duration of pure accumulation supplied by the SF disk.\nDuring phase II clouds begin to form due to line cooling and sink to the SF\ndisk. Phase III is a period of preventing clouds from sinking to the SF disk\nthrough dynamic interaction between clouds and the CAS. Finally, phase IV is an\ninevitable collapse of the entire CAS through line cooling. This CAS evolution\ndrives the episodic appearance of BLRs. Geometry and dynamics of BLRs can be\nself-consistently derived from the thermal instability of the CAS during phases\nII and III by linear analysis. The metallicity gradient of SF disk gives rise\nto different properties of clouds from outer to inner part of BLRs. We find\nthat clouds have column density N_H < 10^22cm^{-2} in the metal-rich regions\nwhereas they have N_H > 10^22 cm^{-2} in the metal-poor regions. The metal-rich\nclouds compose the high ionization line (HIL) regions whereas the metal-poor\nclouds are in low ionization line (LIL) regions. Metal-rich clouds in HIL\nregions will be blown away by radiation pressure, forming the observed\noutflows. The LIL regions are episodic due to the mass cycle of clouds with the\nCAS in response to continuous injection by the SF disk, giving rise to\ndifferent types of AGNs. Based on SDSS quasar spectra, we identify a spectral\nsequence in light of emission line equivalent width from Phase I to IV. A key\nphase in the episodic appearance of the BLRs is bright type II AGNs with no or\nonly weak BLRs.

At\nscales smaller that the void radius the velocity field breaks into expanding\nsub-domains corresponding to sub- voids. These sub-domains break into even\nsmaller sub-sub domains at smaller scales resulting in a nesting hierarchy of\nlocally expanding domains. The ratio between the magnitude of the velocity\nfield responsible for the expansion of the void and the velocity field defining\nthe sub voids is approximately one order of magnitude. The small-scale\ncomponents of the velocity field play a minor role in the shaping of the voids\nbut they define the local dynamics directly affecting the processes of galaxy\nformation and evolution.

While a strong interaction\nbetween SN ejecta and dense circumstellar media (CSM) is a leading scenario,\nalternative models have been proposed. In this Letter, we suggest new\ndiagnostics to discriminate the strong SN-CSM interaction scenario from the\nothers: a decline in the luminosity ('dip') before the main peak of the light\ncurve. This dip is an unavoidable consequence of having a dense CSM within\nwhich the shock breakout occurs. If a dense CSM shell is located far at large\nradii from the progenitor inside, it takes time for the SN ejecta to reach it\nand the early light curve can be powered by the SN ejecta before the collision.\nOnce the SN ejecta collides with the dense CSM, the electron density and thus\nthe Thomson scattering opacity suddenly increase. Photons become unable to go\nout of the shock even if there is a source of emission inside, which results in\nthe dip in the light curve. This dip is a solid prediction from the strong\ninteraction scenario irrespective of a power source for the early emission.\nEventually the forward shock breaks out from within the dense CSM, and the\nluminosity increases by the continuous strong SN-CSM interaction, resulting in\nan SLSN.

In this paper, we\nrevisit the issue by re-simulating a Milky Way class dark matter (DM) halo with\nunprecedented resolution. Our set of cosmological hydrodynamic Adaptive Mesh\nRefinement (AMR) simulations, called the Nut suite, allows us to investigate\nthe effect of supernova feedback and UV photoionisation at high redshift with\nsub-parsec resolution. We subsequently follow the effect of interactions with\nthe Milky Way-like halo using a lower spatial resolution (50pc) version of the\nsimulation down to z=0.

Photoionisation appears to\nplay a very minor role in suppressing star and galaxy formation in all\nprogenitors of satellite halos. By far the largest effect on the satellite\npopulation is found to be the mass of the host and whether gas cooling is\nincluded in the simulation or not.

We have used the cross-correlation technique of Newman (2008) to establish\nthe LRG redshift distribution. Cross-correlating with SDSS QSOs, MegaZ-LRGs and\nDEEP2 galaxies implies an average LRG redshift of z~1 with space density,\nn_g~3.2 +/-0.16 x10^-4 h^3 Mpc^-3. For theta<10', w(theta) significantly\ndeviates from a single power-law. A double power-law with a break at r_b~2.4\nh^-1 Mpc fits the data better, with best-fit scale length, r_0,1=7.63+/-0.27\nh^-1Mpc and slope gamma_1=2.01 +/-0.02 at small scales and r_0,2=9.92 +/-0.40\nh^-1 Mpc and gamma_2=1.64 +/-0.04 at large scales.

As a first systematic study of\nType 1s, we obtained mid-/near-IR data for small samples over ~3-4 orders of\nmagnitudes in UV luminosity L of the central engine.

Consistent with a naive expectation for such dust grains, the\ndust sublimation radius R_in is in fact empirically known to be scaling with\nL^1/2 from the near-IR reverberation measurements, and this is also supported\nby our near-IR interferometry. Utilizing this empirical relationship, we\nnormalize the radial extent by R_in and eliminate the simple L^1/2 scaling for\na direct comparison over the samples.

We use deep observations at 20 GHz to\ninvestigate whether the distribution is bimodal at high radio frequencies.\nCarrying out this study at high radio frequencies has an advantage over\nprevious studies as the radio emission comes predominantly from the core of the\nAGN, hence probes the most recent activity. Studies carried out at lower\nfrequencies are dominated by the large scale lobes where the emission is built\nup over longer timescales (10^7-10^8 yrs), thereby confusing the sample. Our\nsample comprises 874 X-ray selected QSOs that were observed as part of the 6dF\nGalaxy Survey. Of these, 40% were detected down to a 3 sigma detection limit of\n0.2-0.5 mJy.\n  No evidence of bimodality is seen in either the 20 GHz luminosity\ndistribution or in the distribution of the R_20 parameter: the ratio of the\nradio to optical luminosities traditionally used to classify objects as being\neither radio-loud or radio-quiet.

Ultra-violet (UV) emission from a quasar is normally\nfree from the contamination from its host galaxy. Polarization fraction of the\nquasar's disc emission can therefore be determined by comparing total UV\nemission with polarized visible to near-infrared (NIR) emission; and the\nresulting continuum spectrum from UV to infrared can reveal the theoretically\nexpected Balmer edge absorption feature. We fit the polarized spectra in\nvisible and NIR bands together with the total UV spectra of two type-1 quasars\n(3C 95, 4C 09.72), to an extended geometrically thin and optically thick\naccretion disc model. In addition to the standard model, we include the Balmer\nedge absorption due to co-rotational neutral gas on a narrow annulus of the\naccretion disc. We find that the extended thin accretion disc model provides\nadequate description on the continuum spectra of the two quasars from UV to NIR\nwavelengths. A Monte-Carlo-Markov-Chain fitting to the continuum spectra is\nable to well constrain the true polarization fraction of the disk emission,\nwhich allows the Balmer edge feature to be completely revealed from polarized\nvisible to UV continua. The Balmer edge feature is prominent in both quasars'\nspectra, and is significantly broadened due to the orbital motion of gas in the\naccretion disc. The broadening of the Balmer edge feature is therefore related\nto the quasar's inclination.

ZENS adopts novel approaches, here described, to\nquantify four different galactic environments, namely: (1) the mass of the host\ngroup halo; (2) the projected halo-centric distance; (3) the rank of galaxies\nas central or satellites within their group halos; and (4) the filamentary\nlarge-scale structure (LSS) density. No self-consistent identification of a\ncentral galaxy is found in ~40% of <10^13.5 M_sun groups, from which we\nestimate that ~15% of groups at these masses are dynamically unrelaxed systems.\nCentral galaxies in relaxed and unrelaxed groups have in general similar\nproperties, suggesting that centrals are regulated by their mass and not by\ntheir environment.

Under the canonical assumption that\nthe spectrum of CRs is a power-law in momentum and that the spectrum of\nsecondaries is stationary, we find that the combination of the steep spectrum\nof CRs necessary to explain the spectrum of the halo and their very broad\nspatial distribution (and large energy density) result in a gamma-ray emission\nin excess of present limits, unless the cluster magnetic field is sufficiently\nlarge.

With a suite of cosmological\nsimulations, we follow the diffusive shock acceleration as well as radiative\nand Coulomb cooling of cosmic ray electrons during the assembly of a cluster.\nWe find a substantial population of fossil electrons. When reaccelerated at a\nshock (through diffusive shock acceleration), they are competitive with direct\ninjection at strong shocks and overwhelmingly dominate by many orders of\nmagnitude at weak shocks, Mach < 3, which are the vast majority at the cluster\nperiphery. Their relative importance depends on cooling physics and is robust\nto the shock acceleration model used. While the abundance of fossils can vary\nby a factor of ~10, the typical reaccelerated fossil population has radio\nbrightness in excellent agreement with observations.

In order to investigate a possible mechanism of\nmagnetogenesis in the primordial plasma, here we consider cosmological\nperturbations in the Einstein-Aether gravity model, in which the aether field\ncan act as a new source of vector metric perturbations and thus of magnetic\nfields. We estimate the angular power spectra of temperature and B-mode\npolarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) Anisotropies in this\nmodel and put a rough constraint on the aether field parameters from latest\nobservations. We then estimate the power spectrum of associated magnetic fields\naround the recombination epoch within this limit.

This supercluster is one of a few known examples\nof the progenitors of present-day massive clusters (10^{15} Msun by z~0.5).

We\npresent a series of idealized numerical experiments, performed with the\nradiation-hydrodynamic code ORION, in which we study the dynamics of such winds\nand quantify their properties. We find that, after wind acceleration begins,\nradiation Rayleigh-Taylor instability forces the gas into a configuration that\nreduces the rate of momentum transfer from the radiation field to the gas by a\nfactor ~ 10 - 100 compared to an estimate based on the optical depth at the\nbase of the atmosphere; instead, the rate of momentum transfer from a driving\nradiation field of luminosity L to the gas is roughly L/c multiplied by one\nplus half the optical depth evaluated using the photospheric temperature, which\nis far smaller than the optical depth one would obtain using the interior\ntemperature.

Far from the Galactic plane (|b| > 30 degrees), the observed\ngamma-ray emission is nearly invariant with latitude, and is consistent with\narising from inverse Compton scattering of the interstellar radiation field by\ncosmic-ray electrons with an approximately power-law spectrum. The same\nelectrons in the presence of microgauss-scale magnetic fields can also generate\nthe the observed microwave \"haze\". At lower latitudes (b < 20 degrees), in\ncontrast, the spectrum of the emission correlated with the Bubbles possesses a\npronounced spectral feature peaking at 1-4 GeV (in E^2 dN/dE) which cannot be\ngenerated by any realistic spectrum of electrons. Instead, we conclude that a\nsecond (non-inverse-Compton) emission mechanism must be responsible for the\nbulk of the low-energy, low-latitude emission. This second component is\nspectrally similar to the excess GeV emission previously reported from the\nGalactic Center (GC), and also appears spatially consistent with a luminosity\nper volume falling approximately as r^-2.4, where r is the distance from the\nGC. We argue that the spectral feature visible in the low-latitude Bubbles is\nthe extended counterpart of the GC excess, now detected out to at least 2-3 kpc\nfrom the GC. The spectrum and angular distribution of the signal is consistent\nwith that predicted from ~10 GeV dark matter particles annihilating to leptons,\nor from ~50 GeV dark matter particles annihilating to quarks, following a\ndistribution similar to the canonical Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile.

Abstract: The intrinsic X-ray emission of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) is often found to be\nabsorbed over and above the column density through our own galaxy. The extra\ncomponent is usually assumed to be due to absorbing gas lying within the host\ngalaxy of the GRB itself. There is an apparent correlation between the\nequivalent column density of hydrogen, N(H,intrinsic) (assuming it to be at the\nGRB redshift), and redshift, z, with the few z>6 GRBs showing the greatest\nintrinsic column densities. We investigate the N(H,intrinsic) - z relation\nusing a large sample of Swift GRBs, as well as active galactic nuclei (AGN) and\nquasar samples, paying particular attention to the spectral energy\ndistributions of the two highest redshift GRBs. Various possible sample biases\nand systematics that might produce such a correlation are considered, and we\nconclude that the correlation is very likely to be real. This may indicate\neither an evolutionary effect in the host galaxy properties, or a contribution\nfrom gas along the line-of-sight, in the diffuse intergalactic medium (IGM) or\nintervening absorbing clouds.

However, a comparable\nlevel of absorption is also expected from the cumulative effect of intervening\ncold gas clouds, and given current uncertainties it is not possible to say\nwhich, if either, dominates.

Our analysis shows a tendency for\nthe clustering strength to decrease with limiting fluxes: r0(S100um >8 mJy)~4.3\nMpc and r0(S100um >5 mJy)~5.8 Mpc. These values convert into minimum halo\nmasses Mmin~10^{11.6} Msun for sources brighter than 8 mJy and Mmin~10^{12.4}\nMsun for S100um > 5 mJy galaxies. We show such an increase of the clustering\nstrength to be due to an intervening population of z~2 sources, which are very\nstrongly clustered and whose relative contribution, equal to about 10% of the\ntotal counts at S100um > 2 mJy, rapidly decreases for brighter flux cuts. By\nremoving such a contribution, we find that z <~ 1 FIR galaxies have\napproximately the same clustering properties, irrespective of their flux level.\nThe above results were then used to investigate the intrinsic dependence on\ncosmic epoch of the clustering strength of dusty star-forming galaxies between\nz~0 and z~2.5.

The\nvelocity dispersions and stacked particle velocity distributions of the parent\ndark matter (DM) halos are compared to the corresponding cluster dispersions\nand galaxy velocity distribution.

In the\nCD scenario a white dwarf (WD) merges with the core of an asymptotic giant\nbranch (AGB) star and forms a rapidly rotating WD, with a mass close to and\nabove the critical mass for explosion. Rapid rotation prevents immediate\ncollapse and/or explosion. Spinning down over a time of 0-10 Gyr brings the WD\nto explosion.

Most inflationary models predict\nan approximately scale-invariant spectrum, which therefore cannot be used as a\ndistinctive signature.

At all redshifts, Tdust increases with infrared luminosities\n(LIR), specific SFRs (SSFR; i.e., SFR/M*) and distances with respect to the\nmain sequence (MS) of the SFR-M* plane (i.e.,\nD_SSFR_MS=log[SSFR(galaxy)/SSFR_MS(M*,z)]). The Tdust-SSFR and Tdust-D_SSFR_MS\ncorrelations are statistically more significant than the Tdust-LIR one. While\nthe slopes of these three correlations are redshift-independent, their\nnormalizations evolve from z=0 and z~2. We convert these results into a recipe\nto derive Tdust from SFR, M* and z. The existence of a strong Tdust-D_SSFR_MS\ncorrelation provides us with information on the dust and gas content of\ngalaxies. (i) The slope of the Tdust-D__SSFR_MS correlation can be explained by\nthe increase of the star-formation efficiency (SFE; SFR/Mgas) with D_SSFR_MS as\nfound locally by molecular gas studies.

This work addresses the AGN IR-selection dependency on intrinsic source\nluminosity and obscuration, in order to identify and charaterise biases which\ncould affect conclusions in studies. METHODS. We study IR-selected AGN in the\nChandra Deep Field South (CDFS) survey and in the Cosmological Survey (COSMOS).\nThe AGN sample is divided into low and high X-ray luminosity classes, and into\nunobscured (type-1) and obscured (type-2) classes by means of X-ray and optical\nspectroscopy data. Specifically in the X-rays regime, we adopt the intrinsic\nluminosity taking into account the estimated column density (N_H). We also take\nthe chance to highlight important differences resulting from adopting different\nmethods to assess AGN obscuration. RESULTS. In agreement with previous studies,\nwe also find that AGN IR-selection efficiency shows a decrease with decreasing\nsource AGN X-ray luminosity. For the intermediate-luminosity AGN population\n(43.3<~log(L_X[erg/s])<~44$), the efficiency also worsens with increasing\nobscuration. The same sample also shows an evolution with cosmic time of the\nobscured fraction at the highest X-ray luminosities, independently of adopted\ntype-1/type-2 classification method. CONCLUSIONS. We confirm that AGN\nIR-selection is genuinely biased toward unobscured AGN, but only at\nintermediate luminosities. At the highest luminosities, where AGN IR-selection\nis more efficient, there is no obscuration bias. We show that type-1 AGN are\nintrinsically more luminous than type-2 AGN only at z<~1.6, thus resulting in\nmore type-1 AGN being selected the shallower the IR survey is.

The first epoch spectrum shows\nthat the ISM in the GRB host galaxy at z = 2.8145 is extremely rich in\nabsorption features, with three components contributing to the line profiles.\nThe hydrogen column density associated with GRB 120327A has log NH / cm^(-2) =\n22.01 +/- 0.09, and the metallicity of the host galaxy is in the range [X/H] =\n-1.3 to -1.1. In addition to the ground state lines, we detect absorption\nfeatures associated with excited states of CII, OI, SiII, FeII, and NiII, which\nwe used to derive information on the distance between the host absorbing gas\nand the site of the GRB explosion. The variability of the FeI\\lambda2396\nexcited line between the two epochs proves that these features are excited by\nthe GRB UV flux. Moreover, the distance of component I is found to be\ndI=200+100-60 pc, while component II is located closer to the GRB, at\ndII=100+40-30 pc. These values are among the lowest found in GRBs.

Taken as an ensemble, star formation in nearby dwarfs dips to\nlower-than-average rates at intermediate times ($4<t$/Gyr $<8$), a feature that\nwe trace in the simulation to the effects of cosmic reionization. Reionization\nheats the gas and drives it out of the shallow potential wells of low mass\nhalos, affecting especially those below a sharp mass threshold that corresponds\nto a virial temperature of $\\sim 2 \\times 10^4 $ $\\mathrm{K}$ at $z_{\\rm\nreion}$.\n  The loss of baryons leads to a sharp decline in the star forming activity of\nearly-collapsing systems, which, compounded by feedback from early star\nformation, empties halos of gas and leaves behind systems where a single old\nstellar component prevails. In halos below the threshold at $z_{\\rm reion}$,\nreionization heating leads to a delay in the onset of star formation that lasts\nuntil the halo grows massive enough to allow some of the remaining gas to cool\nand form stars.

We performed Monte Carlo simulations of 10^7 MS+MS\nbinaries for 9 different models using standard assumptions for the initial\nprimary mass function, binary separations, and initial-mass-ratio distribution\nand evolved these systems using the publicly available BSE code. Including a\nfraction of recombination energy leads to a clear prediction of a large number\nof long orbital period (>~10 days) systems mostly containing high-mass WDs. The\nfraction of systems with He-core WD primaries increases with the CE efficiency\nand the existence of very low-mass He WDs is only predicted for high values of\nthe CE efficiency (>~0.5).

We show that the halo\nmass history is well described by an exponential function of redshift in the\nhigh-redshift regime. However, in the low-redshift regime the mass history\nfollows a power law because the growth of density perturbations is halted in\nthe dark energy dominated era due to the accelerated expansion of the Universe.\nWe provide an analytic model that follows the expression $M(z) =\nM_{0}(1+z)^{af(M_{0})}e^{-f(M_{0})z}$, where $M_{0} = M(z=0)$, $a$ depends on\ncosmology and $f(M_{0})$ depends only on the linear matter power spectrum.

The\ncoarse-graining in Eulerian space features modified fluid dynamics different\nfrom dust while the coarse-graining in Lagrangian space is performed in the\ninitial conditions with subsequent single streaming dust dynamics, implemented\nby smoothing the initial power spectrum in the spirit of the truncated\nZel'dovich approximation. Finally, we compare the predictions of the different\ncoarse-grained models for the streaming model ingredients to N-body\nmeasurements and comment on the proper choice of both the tracer distribution\nfunction and the smoothing scale. Since the perturbative methods we considered\nare not yet accurate enough on small scales, the GSM is sufficient when applied\nto perturbation theory. \n\n"}

We present\nresults on the evolution of a misaligned gas disc in a cosmological simulation\nof a massive early-type galaxy from the Feedback In Realistic Environments\nproject. This galaxy experiences a merger which, together with a strong\ngalactic wind, removes most of the original gas disc. The galaxy subsequently\nreforms a gas disc through accretion of cold gas, but it is initially 120\ndegrees misaligned with the stellar rotation axis. This misalignment persists\nfor about 2 Gyr before the gas-star misalignment angle drops below 20 degrees.\nThe time it takes for the gaseous and stellar components to align is much\nlonger than previously thought, because the gas disc is accreting a significant\namount of mass for about 1.5 Gyr after the merger, during which the angular\nmomentum change induced by accreted gas dominates over that induced by stellar\ntorques. Once the gas accretion rate has decreased sufficiently, the gas disc\ndecouples from the surrounding halo gas and realigns with the stellar component\nin about 6 dynamical times. During the late evolution of the misaligned gas\ndisc, the centre aligns faster than the outskirts, resulting in a warped disc.\nWe discuss the observational consequences of the long survival of our\nmisaligned gas disc and how our results can be used to calibrate merger rate\nestimates from observed gas misalignments. \n\n"}

Employing this capability over all\nfive 3D-HST/CANDELS fields provides a sample of 2676 galaxies. By creating deep\nstacked Halpha (Ha) images, we reach surface brightness limits of\n1x10^-18\\erg\\s\\cm^2\\arcsec^2, allowing us to map the distribution of ionized\ngas out to >10kpc for typical L* galaxies at this epoch. We find that the\nspatial extent of the Ha distribution increases with stellar mass as\nr(Ha)[kpc]=1.5(Mstars/10^10Msun)^0.23. Furthermore, the Ha emission is more\nextended than the stellar continuum emission, consistent with inside-out\nassembly of galactic disks. This effect, however, is mass dependent with\nr(Ha)/r(stars)=1.1(M/10^10Msun)^0.054, such that at low masses r(Ha)~r(stars).\nWe map the Ha distribution as a function of SFR(IR+UV) and find evidence for\n`coherent star formation' across the SFR-M plane: above the main sequence, Ha\nis enhanced at all radii; below the main sequence, Ha is depressed at all\nradii. This suggests that at all masses the physical processes driving the\nenhancement or suppression of star formation act throughout the disks of\ngalaxies. It also confirms that the scatter in the star forming main sequence\nis real and caused by variations in the star formation rate at fixed mass. At\nhigh masses (10^10.5<M/Msun<10^11), above the main sequence, Ha is particularly\nenhanced in the center, plausibly building bulges and/or supermassive black\nholes. Below the main sequence, the star forming disks are more compact and a\nstrong central dip in the EW(Ha), and the inferred specific star formation\nrate, appears. Importantly though, across the entirety of the SFR-M plane, the\nabsolute star formation rate as traced by Ha is always centrally peaked, even\nin galaxies below the main sequence. \n\n"}

We study the cluster A209 by using the CLASH-VLT spectroscopic data\ncombined with Subaru photometry, yielding to 1916 cluster members down to a\nstellar mass of 10^{8.6} Msun.

The stellar mass function of the star-forming\ngalaxies does not depend on the environment, while the slope found for passive\ngalaxies becomes flatter in the densest region. The color distribution of the\nintra-cluster light is consistent with the color of passive members. The\nanalysis of the dynamical orbits shows that low-mass passive galaxies have\ntangential orbits, avoiding small pericenters around the BCG. The mass-size\nrelation of low-mass passive ETGs is flatter than that of high mass galaxies,\nand its slope is consistent with that of field star-forming galaxies.

However, measuring the signal is technically challenging: one must\nextract a small, frequency-dependent signal from under much brighter spectrally\nsmooth foregrounds. Traditional approaches to study the global signal have used\nsingle antennas, which require one to calibrate out the frequency-dependent\nstructure in the overall system gain (due to internal reflections, for example)\nas well as remove the noise bias from auto-correlating a single amplifier\noutput.

Making use of the AdS/CFT correspondence we can map the bulk\ndynamics onto the boundary. The boundary theory has a time dependent coupling\nconstant which becomes small at times when the bulk space-time is highly\ncurved. We investigate the propagation of small fluctuations of a test scalar\nfield from early times before the bulk singularity to late times after the\nsingularity. Under the assumption that the AdS/CFT correspondence extends to\ndeformed AdS space-times, we can map the bulk evolution of the scalar field\nonto the evolution of the boundary gauge field. The time evolution of\nlinearized fluctuations is well defined in the boundary theory as long as the\ncoupling remains finite, so that we can extend the boundary perturbations to\nlate times after the singularity. Assuming that the spacetime in the future of\nthe singularity has a weakly coupled region near the boundary, we reconstruct\nthe bulk fluctuations after the singularity crossing making use of generic\nproperties of boundary-to-bulk propagators.

Halo occupation distribution\n(HOD) modeling can extend the approach down to nonlinear scales, but galaxy\nassembly bias could introduce systematic errors by causing the HOD to vary with\nlarge scale environment at fixed halo mass. We investigate this problem using\nthe mock galaxy catalogs created by Hearin & Watson (2013, HW13), which exhibit\nsignificant assembly bias because galaxy luminosity is tied to halo peak\ncircular velocity and galaxy colour is tied to halo formation time. The\npreferential placement of galaxies (especially red galaxies) in older halos\naffects the cutoff of the mean occupation function $\\langle\nN_\\text{cen}(M_\\text{min}) \\rangle$ for central galaxies, with halos in\noverdense regions more likely to host galaxies. The effect of assembly bias on\nthe satellite galaxy HOD is minimal. We introduce an extended, environment\ndependent HOD (EDHOD) prescription to describe these results and fit galaxy\ncorrelation measurements. Crucially, we find that the galaxy-matter\ncross-correlation coefficient, $r_{gm} \\equiv \\xi_{gm} \\cdot [ \\xi_{mm}\n\\xi_{gg} ]^{-1/2}$, is insensitive to assembly bias on scales $r \\gtrsim 1 \\;\nh^{-1}\\text{Mpc}$, even though $\\xi_{gm} $ and $\\xi_{gg} $ are both affected\nindividually.

When\n$\\mathbf{C}$ is measured from a set of simulations, an important question is\nhow large this set should be. To answer this question, we construct different\nensembles of $N_r$ realizations of the shear field, using a common\nrandomization procedure that recycles the outputs from a smaller number\n$N_s\\leq N_r$ of independent ray-tracing $N$--body simulations. We study\nparameter confidence intervals as a function of ($N_s,N_r$) in the range $1\\leq\nN_s\\leq 200$ and $1\\leq N_r\\lesssim 10^5$. Previous work has shown that\nGaussian noise in the feature vectors (from which the covariance is estimated)\nlead, at quadratic order, to an $O(1/N_r)$ degradation of the parameter\nconfidence intervals. Using a variety of lensing features measured in our\nsimulations, including shear-shear power spectra and peak counts, we show that\ncubic and quartic covariance fluctuations lead to additional $O(1/N_r^2)$ error\ndegradation that is not negligible when $N_r$ is only a factor of few larger\nthan $N_b$.

In linear theory, this cross-correlation\ncontains only monopole and quadrupole terms. At scales greater than the void\nradius, linear theory is a good match to voids traced out by haloes in N-body\nsimulations; small-scale random velocities are unimportant at these radii, only\ntending to cause small and often negligible elongation of the redshift-space\ncross-correlation function near its origin. By extracting the monopole and\nquadrupole from the cross-correlation function, we measure the linear growth\nrate without prior knowledge of the void profile or velocity dispersion. We\nrecover the linear growth parameter $\\beta$ to 9% precision from an effective\nvolume of 3(Gpc/h)^3 using voids with radius greater than 25Mpc/h. Smaller\nvoids are predominantly sub-voids, which may be more sensitive to the random\nvelocity dispersion; they introduce noise and do not help to improve the\nmeasurement. Adding velocity dispersion as a free parameter allows us to use\ninformation at radii as small as half of the void radius. The precision on\n$\\beta$ is reduced to approximately 5%. Contrary to the simple redshift-space\ndistortion pattern in overdensities, voids show diverse shapes in redshift\nspace, and can appear either elongated or flattened along the line of sight.\nThis can be explained by the competing amplitudes of the local density\ncontrast, plus the radial velocity profile and its gradient, with the latter\ntwo factors being determined by the cumulative density profile of voids. The\ndistortion pattern is therefore determined solely by the void profile and is\ndifferent for void-in-cloud and void-in-void. This diversity of redshift-space\nvoid morphology complicates measurements of the Alcock-Paczynski effect using\nvoids. \n\n"}

We derive a set of conditions on the\nfour free functions of the Horndeski action that examine whether a specific\nmodel embedded in the action possesses an Einstein gravity limit or not. For\nthis purpose, we develop a new and surprisingly simple scaling method that\nidentifies dominant terms in the equations of motion by considering formal\nlimits of the couplings that enter through the new terms in the modified\naction. This enables us to find regimes where nonlinear terms dominate and\nEinstein's field equations are recovered to leading order. Together with an\nefficient approximation of the scalar field profile, one can then further\nevaluate whether these limits can be attributed to a genuine screening effect.\nFor illustration, we apply the analysis to both a cubic galileon and a\nchameleon model as well as to Brans-Dicke theory.

To overcome this, we search for approximately universal (or\nequation-of-state independent) relations between two combinations of the\nindividual tidal deformabilities, such that once one of them has been measured,\nthe other can be automatically obtained and the individual ones decoupled\nthrough these relations.

Lya emitters have ubiquitous large (~40\nkpc) Lya haloes, 2x larger than their Ha extents.

The\nreason is twofold: classically, they provide a tracking solution leading to an\nalmost DeSitter space starting from very generic initial conditions in the deep\nradiation era. The second reason is the standard lore that Galileons are\nquantum mechanically stable. The latter property is certainly true in flat\nspace-time, thanks to the non-renormalization theorems of galilean coupling\nconstants. However, in a cosmological background, we show that quantum effects\nmight dominate the classical trajectory. Assuming the radiation era to last at\nleast up to the electroweak phase transition, the trajectory with initial\nconditions sitting on the tracker is ruled out. On the other hand, it is always\npossible to find a sub-space of initial conditions such that the dark energy\nsolution approaches stably the tracker at late times. Fixing the value of\ninitial conditions that best fit current data, and assuming that the galileon\neffective theory is valid up to the beginning of the radiation epoch, we found\nthat the reheating temperature of the universe cannot be larger than $10^8 \\\n{\\rm GeV}$.

To do so, we\nquantify the azimuthal dependence of the stacked lensing signal around seven\ndifferent proxies for the orientation of the dark matter distribution, as it is\na priori unknown which one traces the orientation best. On small scales, the\nmajor axis of the brightest group/cluster member (BCG) provides the best proxy,\nleading to a clear detection of an anisotropic signal. In order to relate that\nto a halo ellipticity, we have to adopt a model density profile. We derive new\nexpressions for the quadrupole moments of the shear field given an elliptical\nmodel surface mass density profile. Modeling the signal with an elliptical\nNavarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile on scales < 250 kpc, which roughly\ncorresponds to half the virial radius, and assuming that the BCG is perfectly\naligned with the dark matter, we find an average halo ellipticity of e_h=0.38\n+/- 0.12.

The kinematics of the molecular gas shows the presence of different\ncomponents, which cannot be ascribed to simple rotation. Furthermore, on even\nlarger scales, we detect nine additional CO systems within a radius of 250 kpc\nfrom the massive galaxy and mostly distributed in the same direction as the CO\nelongated structure found in the central 40 kpc. The stacked images of these CO\nsystems show detections in the thermal continuum and in the X-rays, suggesting\nthat these systems are forming stars at a rate of 30-120 Msun/yr. We suggest\nthat the extended gas structure, combined with its kinematic properties, and\nthe gas rich star forming systems detected on larger scales, are tracing the\ninner and densest regions of large scale accreting streams, feeding the central\nmassive galaxy.

We estimate stellar ages for the\nMPG population both fitting the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) and through\nthe D4000_n index, obtaining results in good agreement. Our findings are\nconsistent with passive ageing of the stellar content of dense MPGs. We show\nthat at any redshift the less dense MPGs are younger than dense ones and that\ntheir stellar populations evolve at a slower rate than predicted by passive\nevolution.

By calculating the\nmicroscopic viscosity on the basis of various theoretical assumptions and\nestimating the Kolmogorov length from the turbulent dissipation rate computed\nwith a subgrid-scale model, we are able to demonstrate that most of the\nwarm-hot intergalactic medium can sustain a fully turbulent state only if the\nmagnetic suppression of the viscosity is considerable. Accepting this as\npremise, it turns out that ratios of turbulent and thermal quantities change\nonly little in the course of the merger. This confirms the tight correlations\nbetween the mean thermal and non-thermal energy content for large samples of\nclusters in earlier studies, which can be interpreted as second self-similarity\non top of the self-similarity for different halo masses. Another long-standing\nquestion is how and to which extent turbulence contributes to the support of\nthe gas against gravity. From a global perspective, the ratio of turbulent and\nthermal pressures is significant for the clusters in our simulation. On the\nother hand, a local measure is provided by the compression rate, i.e. the\ngrowth rate of the divergence of the flow.

The galaxies that are faint in the rest-frame UV\ncontinuum, strong in Lya and CIII], with compact UV morphology, and localized\nin an underdense environment are characterized by outflow velocities of the\norder of a few hundreds of km/sec.

The model predicts that an HI gas with a column density larger than\n10^20/cm^2 is able to produce Lya peak shifts larger than >300km/sec. An ISM\nwith this value of NHI would favour a large amount of scattering events,\nespecially when the medium is static, so it can explain large values of\nExt(Lya-C) and small EW(Lya).

A white noise power spectral density (PSD) is expected at low\nfrequency in this model, however, direct observational constraint to the low\nfrequency PSD slope is hard due to limited lengths of the light curves\navailable.

Another major improvement is\na new treatment of the intergalactic medium (IGM) opacity for ionizing photons\nthat is able to consistently capture the transition from a neutral to an\nionized IGM. Previous synthesis models of the UVB, when used in simulations,\nyield reionization and thermal histories that are inconsistent with the assumed\nionizing emissivities. With our new treatment, this discrepancy is fully\nresolved. In our fiducial model, galaxies leaking $\\lesssim 18\\%$ of their\nLyman continuum emission drive HI reionization, while AGN drive HeII\nreionization (completing at $z \\simeq 6.2$ and $2.8$ respectively).

Abstract: Galaxies are often used as tracers of the large scale structure (LSS) to\nmeasure the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect (ISW) by cross-correlating the galaxy\nsurvey maps with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) map. We use the Cosmic\nInfrared Background (CIB) as a tracer of the LSS to perform a theoretical\nCIB-CMB cross-correlation to measure the ISW for different Planck HFI\nfrequencies. We discuss the detectability of this ISW signal using a\nSignal-to-noise ratio analysis and find that the ISW detected this way can\nprovide us with the highest SNR for a single tracer ranging from 5 to 6.7\n(maximum being for 857 GHz) with the CIB and CMB maps extracted over the whole\nsky.

Dataflow\ncomputing is a powerful approach using reconfigurable hardware, which can be\ndeeply pipelined and is intrinsically parallel.

Much of the oxygen produced over cosmic time by the galaxy's stars\nalso ends up there. The resulting absorption lines in the spectra of UV and\nX-ray background sources are powerful diagnostics of the feedback processes\nthat prevent more of those baryons from forming stars. This paper presents\npredictions for CGM absorption lines (O VI, O VII, O VIII, Ne VIII, N V) that\nare based on precipitation-regulated feedback models, which posit that the\nradiative cooling time of the ambient medium cannot drop much below 10 times\nthe freefall time without triggering a strong feedback event. The resulting\npredictions align with many different observational constraints on the Milky\nWay's ambient CGM and explain why N_OVI ~ 10^14 cm^-2 over large ranges in halo\nmass and projected radius. Within the precipitation framework, the strongest\nO~VI absorption lines result from vertical mixing of the CGM that raises\nlow-entropy ambient gas to greater altitudes, because adiabatic cooling of the\nuplifted gas then lowers its temperature and raises the fractional abundance of\nO^5+. Condensation stimulated by uplift may also produce associated\nlow-ionization components.

Using analytic calculations verified with mock\ngalaxy catalogs from log-normal simulations we find that constraints are\ndegraded in two ways, even when the interloper power spectrum is modeled\ncorrectly in the likelihood. Firstly, there is a loss of signal-to-noise ratio\nfor the power spectrum of the target galaxies, which propagates to all\ncosmological constraints and increases with contamination fraction, $f_c$.\nSecondly, degeneracies can open up between $f_c$ and cosmological parameters.\nIn our calculations this typically increases BAO scale uncertainties at the\n10-20% level when marginalizing over parameters determining the broadband power\nspectrum shape.

The easily accessible timescales of the bursts (durations of tens of\nseconds and recurrence times of hours to days) allow for a very stringent\ncomparison to theory. The largest discrepancy (which was found with EXOSAT\nobservations) is the accretion rate dependence of the Type I burst properties.\nBursts become less frequent and energetic as the global accretion rate\nincreases, just the opposite of what the spherical theory predicts. I present a\nresolution of this issue by taking seriously the observed dependence of the\nburning area on the global accretion rate, which implies that as the accretion\nrate increases, the accretion rate per unit area decreases.

This softening leads to more compact equilibrium\nconfigurations of neutron stars compared to pure hadronic stars of the same\nmass.

In our original calculation, we used a\nstandard approximation known as the ``linear bias'' [e.g. Mo & White (1996)].\nHere we improve upon that treatment by considering the effect of nonlinear\nclustering. To accomplish this, we develop a new analytical method for\ncalculating the nonlinear Eulerian bias of halos, which should be useful for\nother applications as well. Predictions of this method are compared with the\nresults of LambdaCDM N-body simulations, showing significantly better agreement\nthan the standard linear bias approximation.

In contrast with previous results for the extended disk,\nthe emission-line spectrum of the central region is best reproduced by a\nmulti-component photoionization scenario, rather than shock heating. The\nnebular properties as well as energetic considerations suggest a transition on\nscales of several tens of parsecs, from predominantly photoionization by a\ncentral accretion source, to shock ionization within the disk. If this source\nis at all representative, it suggests that many LINERs may be composite in\nterms of the energetic processes that give rise to the emission spectrum. We\nalso report measurements of resonance-line absorption for the nucleus. The\nabsorption spectrum, like the emission lines, is characterized by low\nionization. The absorption line measurements coupled with independent\nconstraints suggests a total hydrogen column density of 10^19 - 10^20 cm^-2,\noutflowing from the galaxy center with a velocity of ~126 km/s.

TF\nrelations (TFRs) for various morphological types have different zero points,\nbut a common slope, such that early-type (redder) disks rotate faster than\nlater-types (bluer) of the same luminosity. This dependence of the TFR is a\ndirect consequence of the more fundamental dependence on color, which itself is\nrelated to the galaxy star formation history.

We present new numerical simulations of planet formation\nby core accretion that establish the timescale on which a Jovian planet reaches\nrapid gas accretion, t_rga, as a function of solid surface density sigma_solid:\n(t_rga / 1 Myr) = (sigma_solid / 25.0 g cm^{-2})^{-1.44}.

Under the assumptions of zero H2 abundance and very\nmodest pollution by metals (<10^-4 Solar), fragmentation is likely to be\ninhibited for such an equation of state. We argue on purely thermodynamic\ngrounds that a single black hole of ~0.02-0.003M_h can form at the center of a\nhalo for z=10-20 when the free-fall time is less than the time needed for a\nresonantly scattered Lyman alpha photon to escape from the halo.

Under certain conditions, this Li-7\ncreation can take the place of the Li-7 destruction normally expected. Note\nthat such extra mixing on the red giant branch (RGB) has previously been\ninvoked to explain the observed C-13 enhancements. This new Li-7 production can\naccount for the recent discovery of surprisingly high lithium abundances in\nsome low mass red giants (a few of which are super-rich lithium stars, with\nabundances higher than that in the interstellar medium). The amount of Li-7\nproduced can exceed log epsilon(Li-7) = 4, but depends critically on the\ndetails of the extra mixing mechanism (mixing speeds, geometry, episodicity).\nIf the deep circulation is a relatively long-lived, continuous process,\nlithium-rich RGB stars should be completely devoid of beryllium and boron. CBP\nalso leads to He-3 destruction in low mass stars; in contrast to Li-7 creation,\nthe extent of He-3 depletion is largely independent of the details of the extra\nmixing mechanism. The overall contribution from solar-metallicity stars (1 - 40\nMsun) is expected to be net destruction of He-3, with overall He-3 survival\nfraction g_3 = 0.9 +/- 0.2 (weighted average) --- in contrast to standard\ndredge-up, which would predict stars are net producers of He-3 (g_3:dr = 2.4\n+/- 0.5). Pop II stars experience even more severe He-3 depletion, with 0.3 <\ng_3 < 0.7. Destruction of He-3 in low mass stars is consistent with the\nrequirements of galactic chemical evolution models; it would also result in\nsome relaxation of the upper bound on the primordial (D + He-3)/H abundance. \n\n"}

A plausible explanation is\nthat G1 contains a central massive dark object of mass M_MDO ~ 4x10^9\nh_100^{-1} M_sun (h_100 = H_0/100km/s/Mpc), which contributes to the central\nvelocity dispersion, and that the outer value of sigma_v is the appropriate\nmeasure of the depth of the potential well of G1.

The cluster velocity dispersion and the core radius are limited to\n540-670 km/s and 5 arcsec - 11\\arcsec, respectively, and the brightness of the\nunlensed counterimage of cB58 is about 23.9 +- 0.3 (R-band), corresponding to a\nmagnification and extinction corrected restframe-B band absolute magnitude of\n-24.75 +- 0.7 mag.

The shocks are assumed to be due to a variety of galactic sources on a\nrange of scales. An analytic result for the kinematic vorticity generated by a\nshock passing through a radially-stratified two-dimensional isobaric model\ncloud is derived, assuming that the Mach number is not so large that the cloud\nis disrupted, and neglecting the shock curvature and cloud distortion.\nTwo-dimensional lattic gas hydrodynamic simulations at modest Mach numbers were\nused to verify the analytic result. The induced internal velocities are\ninitially a significant fraction of the shock speed divided by the square root\nof the density contrast, accounting for both the observed linewidth amplitudes\nand the apparent cloud-to-cloud linewidth-density scaling. The linewidth-size\nrelation could then be interpreted in terms of the well-known power spectrum of\na system of shocks.

Although the ZA\ncorrectly reproduces the linear growing modes of density and velocity\nperturbations, non-linear growth is inaccurately represented because of the ZA\nfailure to conserve momentum. This implies that it takes time for the actual\ndynamics to establish the correct statistical properties of density and\nvelocity fields. We extend perturbation theory (PT) to include transients as\nnon-linear excitations of decaying modes caused by the IC. We focus on\nhigher-order statistics of the density contrast and velocity divergence,\ncharacterized by the S_p and T_p parameters. We find that the time-scale of\ntransients is determined, at a given order p, by the spectral index n. The\nskewness factor S_3 (T_3) attains 10% accuracy only after a=6 (a=15) for n=0,\nwhereas higher (lower) n demands more (less) expansion away from the IC. These\nrequirements become much more stringent as p increases. An Omega=0.3 model\nrequires a factor of two larger expansion than an Omega=1 model to reduce\ntransients by the same amount. The predicted transients in S_p are in good\nagreement with numerical simulations.

{"id": "hep-ph/0507123", "contents": "Title: Direct dark matter search by observing electrons produced in\n  neutralino-nucleus collisions Abstract: Exotic dark matter and dark energy together seem to dominate in the Universe.\nSupersymmetry naturally provides a candidate for the dark matter constituents\nvia the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). The most important process for\ndirectly detecting dark matter is the LSP-nucleus elastic scattering by\nmeasuring the energy of the recoiling nucleus. In the present work we explore a\nnovel process, which has definite experimental advantages, that is the\ndetection of the dark matter constituents by observing the low energy\nionization electrons. These electrons, which are produced during the\nLSP-nucleus collision, may be observed separately or in coincidence with the\nrecoiling nuclei.\n  We develop the formalism and apply it in calculating the ratio of the\nionization rate to the nuclear recoil rate in a variety of atoms including\nNe-20, Ar-40, Ge-76, Kr-78 and Xe-132 employing realistic Hartree-Fock electron\nwave functions.\n  The obtained ratios are essentially independent of all parameters of\nsupersymmetry except the neutralino mass, but they crucially depend on the\nelectron energy cut off. These ratios per electron tend to increase with the\natomic number and can be as high as 10 per cent. Based on our results it is\nboth interesting and realistic to detect the LSP by measuring the ionization\nelectrons following the-LSP nuclear collisions. \n\n"}

When the scalar and pseudoscalar\nsuperpartners are relativistic they will decouple at much later times than the\ngoldstino and consequently will be the dominant effect when obtaining a\nnucleosynthesis bound on the scale of supersymmetry breaking.

{"id": "hep-th/0112144", "contents": "Title: A theory of algebraic integration Abstract: In this paper we extend the idea of integration to generic algebras. In\nparticular we concentrate over a class of algebras, that we will call\nself-conjugated, having the property of possessing equivalent right and left\nmultiplication algebras. In this case it is always possible to define an\nintegral sharing many of the properties of the usual integral. For instance, if\nthe algebra has a continuous group of automorphisms, the corresponding\nderivations are such that the usual formula of integration by parts holds. We\ndiscuss also how to integrate over subalgebras. Many examples are discussed,\nstarting with Grassmann algebras, where we recover the usual Berezin's rule.\nThe paraGrassmann algebras are also considered, as well as the algebra of\nmatrices. Since Grassmann and paraGrassmann algebras can be represented by\nmatrices we show also that their integrals can be seen in terms of traces over\nthe corresponding matrices. An interesting application is to the case of group\nalgebras where we show that our definition of integral is equivalent to a sum\nover the unitary irreducuble representations of the group. We show also some\nexample of integration over non self-conjugated algebras (the bosonic and the\n$q$-bosonic oscillators), and over non-associative algebras (the octonions). \n\n"}
