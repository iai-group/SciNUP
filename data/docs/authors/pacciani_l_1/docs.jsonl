Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days.

These are examples\nof the first major episodes of star formation in the Universe and provide\ninsights into the formation of the earliest massive galaxies. We have examined\nin detail the stellar populations of six z~1.5 galaxies that appear to be\npassively evolving, using both ground and space-based photometry covering\nrest-frame UV to visible wavelengths. In addition, we have obtained\nmedium-resolution spectroscopy for five of the six galaxies, covering the\nrest-frame UV portion of the spectrum. Spectral synthesis modeling for four of\nthese galaxies favors a single burst of star formation more than 1 Gyr before\nthe observed epoch.

The\nresulting convection heats the intracluster plasma and regulates its\ntemperature and density profiles. By adjusting a single parameter in the model\n(the size of the cosmic-ray acceleration region), we are able to achieve a good\nmatch to the observed density and temperature profiles in a sample of eight\nclusters. Our results suggest that convection is an important process in\ncluster cores. An interesting feature of our solutions is that the cooling rate\nis more sharply peaked about the cluster center than is the convective heating\nrate. As a result, in several of the clusters in our sample, a compact cooling\nflow arises in the central region with a size R that is typically a few kpc.\nThe cooling flow matches onto a Bondi flow at smaller radii. The mass accretion\nrate in the Bondi flow is equal to, and controlled by, the rate at which mass\nflows in through the cooling flow.

We describe how the size of the\nbound WIMP population depends on the WIMP mass, spin-independent cross section,\nand spin-dependent cross section. Using a standard description of the Galactic\nDM halo, we find that the maximum enhancement to the direct detection event\nrate, consistent with current experimental constraints on the WIMP-nucleon\ncross section, is < 1% relative to the event rate from halo WIMPs, while the\nevent rate from neutrinos from WIMP annihilation in the center of the Earth is\nunlikely to meet the threshold of next-generation, km^3-sized (IceCube, KM3NeT)\nneutrino telescopes. \n\n"}

They could have been recognized by BATSE as short/hard GRBs should\nthey have occurred at z <= 1. We perform a more thorough investigation on two\nphysically distinct types (Type I/II) of cosmological GRBs and their\nobservational characteristics. We reiterate the definitions of Type I/II GRBs\nand review the observational criteria and their physical motivations. Contrary\nto the traditional approach of assigning the physical category based on the\ngamma-ray properties (duration, hardness, and spectral lag), we take an\nalternative approach to define the Type I and Type II Gold Samples using\nseveral criteria that are more directly related to the GRB progenitors, and\nstudy the properties of the two Gold Samples and compare them with the\ntraditional long/soft and short/hard samples. We find that the Type II Gold\nSample reasonably tracks the long/soft population, although it includes several\nintrinsically short (shorter than 1s in the rest frame) GRBs. The Type I Gold\nSample only has 5 GRBs, 4 of which are not strictly short but have extended\nemission. Other short/hard GRBs detected in the Swift era represent the BATSE\nshort/hard sample well, but it is unclear whether all of them belong to Type I.\nWe suggest that some (probably even most) high-luminosity short/hard GRBs\ninstead belong to Type II. We suggest that GRB 080913 and GRB 090423 are more\nlikely Type II events. We re-emphasize the importance of invoking multiple\nobservational criteria, and cautiously propose an operational procedure to\ninfer the physical origin of a given GRB with available multiple observational\ncriteria, with various caveats laid out. \n\n"}

At low metallicity, large line opacity stems from\ntriplet-quintet intersystem electron collisions, a form of coupling previously\nnot considered or seriously underestimated.

For this purpose we have analyzed mock absorption spectra\nextracted from different hydrodynamical simulations used to model the\nproperties of the Warm Hot Intergalactic Medium [WHIM]. These models predict\nthe correct abundance of OVI absorption lines observed in UV and satisfy\ncurrent X-ray constraints. According to these models space missions like EDGE\nand XENIA should be able to detect about 60 WHIM absorbers per year through the\nOVII line. About 45 % of these have at least two more detectable lines in\naddition to OVII that can be used to determine the density and the temperature\nof the gas.

The gamma-ray flux is variable, with strong, distinct,\nsymmetrically-shaped flares for which the flux increases by a factor of several\non a time scale of about three days. This variability indicates a compact\nemission region, and the requirement that the source is optically thin to\npair-production implies relativistic beaming with Doppler factor delta > 8,\nconsistent with the values inferred from VLBI observations of superluminal\nexpansion (delta ~ 25). The observed gamma-ray spectrum is not consistent with\na simple power-law, but instead steepens strongly above ~2 GeV, and is well\ndescribed by a broken power-law with photon indices of ~2.3 and ~3.5 below and\nabove the break, respectively. This is the first direct observation of a break\nin the spectrum of a high luminosity blazar above 100 MeV, and it is likely\ndirect evidence for an intrinsic break in the energy distribution of the\nradiating particles. Alternatively, the spectral softening above 2 GeV could be\ndue to gamma-ray absorption via photon-photon pair production on the soft X-ray\nphoton field of the host AGN, but such an interpretation would require the\ndissipation region to be located very close (less than 100 gravitational radii)\nto the black hole, which would be inconsistent with the X-ray spectrum of the\nsource. \n\n"}

Whatever\nthe precise mechanism that causes them, these jets must therefore exert a\nbraking torque on the black hole.

We find that the\npredicted black hole spin-up function depends only on the black hole spin and\ndimensionless parameters describing the accretion flow. Using recent\nrelativistic magnetohydrodynamical numerical simulation results to calibrate\nthe efficiency of angular momentum transfer in the flow, we find that an ADAF\nflow will spin a black hole up (or down) to an equilibrium value of about 96%\nof the maximal spin value in the absence of jets.

PDS of\naccreting X-ray pulsars where the neutron star is close to the corotation with\nthe accretion disk at the magnetospheric boundary, have a distinct break/cutoff\nat the neutron star spin frequency. This break can naturally be explained in\nthe \"perturbation propagation\" model, which assumes that at any given radius in\nthe accretion disk stochastic perturbations are introduced to the flow with\nfrequencies characteristic for this radius. These perturbations are then\nadvected to the region of main energy release leading to a self-similar\nvariability of X-ray flux P~f^{-1...-1.5}. The break in the PDS is then a\nnatural manifestation of the transition from the disk to magnetospheric flow at\nthe frequency characteristic for the accretion disk truncation radius\n(magnetospheric radius). The proximity of the PDS break frequency to the spin\nfrequency in corotating pulsars strongly suggests that the typical variability\ntime scale in accretion disks is close to the Keplerian one.

We then arranged a set of reference objects mimicking\nactive galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the local universe, with which correlations of\nsimulated UHECR events are analyzed. With our model IGMF, the deflection angle\nbetween the arrival direction of super-GZK protons and the sky position of\ntheir actual sources is quite large with the mean value of $<\\theta > \\sim\n15^{\\circ}$ and the median value of $\\tilde \\theta \\sim 7 - 10^{\\circ}$. On the\nother hand, the separation angle between the arrival direction and the sky\nposition of nearest reference objects is substantially smaller with $<S > \\sim\n3.5 - 4^{\\circ}$, which is similar to the mean angular distance in the sky to\nnearest neighbors among the reference objects. This is a direct consequence of\nour model that the sources, observers, reference objects, and the IGMF all\ntrace the matter distribution of the universe. The result implies that\nextragalactic objects lying closest to the arrival direction of UHECRs are not\nnecessary their actual sources. With our model for the distribution of\nreference objects, the fraction of super-GZK proton events, whose closest AGNs\nare true sources, is less than 1/3.

As\nthe black hole mass grows, its spin changes in strength and direction due to\nits gravito-magnetic coupling with the small-scale accretion disc. We find that\nthe black hole spins loose memory of their initial orientation, as accretion\ntorques suffice to align the spins with the angular momentum of their orbit on\na short timescale (<1-2 Myr). A residual off-set in the spin direction relative\nto the orbital angular momentum remains, at the level of <10 degrees for the\ncase of a cold disc, and <30 degrees for a warmer disc.

The parameters we vary are the Mach number of the inflow\nvelocity of the streams, Msinf, the rms Mach number of the initial background\nturbulence in the WNM, and the total mass contained in the colliding gas\nstreams, Minf. Because the SFE is a function of time, we define two estimators\nfor it, the \"absolute\" SFE, measured at t = 25 Myr into the simulation's\nevolution (sfeabs), and the \"relative\" SFE, measured 5 Myr after the onset of\nstar formation in each simulation (sferel). The latter is close to the \"star\nformation rate per free-fall time\" for gas at n = 100 cm^-3. We find that both\nestimators decrease with increasing Minf, although by no more than a factor of\n2 as Msinf increases from 1.25 to 3.5. Increasing levels of background\nturbulence similarly reduce the SFE, because the turbulence disrupts the\ncoherence of the colliding streams, fragmenting the cloud, and producing\nsmall-scale clumps scattered through the numerical box, which have low SFEs.\nFinally, the SFE is very sensitive to the mass of the inflows, with sferel\ndecreasing from ~0.4 to ~0.04 as the the virial parameter in the colliding\nstreams increases from ~0.15 to ~1.5. This trend is in partial agreement with\nthe prediction by Krumholz & McKee (2005), since the latter lies within the\nsame range as the observed efficiencies, but with a significantly shallower\nslope. We conclude that the observed variability of the SFE is a highly\nsensitive function of the parameters of the cloud formation process, and may be\nthe cause of significant scatter in observational determinations. \n\n"}

One of the most likely sources of\nisotropic EM emission from compact object mergers is a supernova-like transient\npowered by the radioactive decay of heavy elements synthesized in ejecta from\nthe merger. We present the first calculations of the optical transients from\ncompact object mergers that self-consistently determine the radioactive heating\nby means of a nuclear reaction network; using this heating rate, we model the\nlight curve with a one dimensional Monte Carlo radiation transfer calculation.\nFor an ejecta mass ~1e-2 M_sun[1e-3 M_sun] the resulting light curve peaks on a\ntimescale ~ 1 day at a V-band luminosity nu L_nu ~ 3e41[1e41] ergs/s (M_V =\n-15[-14]); this corresponds to an effective \"f\" parameter ~3e-6 in the\nLi-Paczynski toy model.

Consistent with the\npowerful, high-z giant radio galaxies we have studied previously, X-rays seem\nto be invariably found where the lobe plasma is oldest even where the radio\nemission has long since faded. The hotspot complexes seem to show structures\nresembling the double shock structure exhibited by the largest radio quasar\n4C74.26, with the X-ray shock again being offset closer to the nucleus than the\nradio synchrotron shock. In the current paper, the offsets between these shocks\nare even larger at 35kpc. Unusually for a classical double (FRII) radio source,\nthere is smooth low surface-brightness radio emission associated with the\nregions beyond the hotspots (further away from the nucleus than the hotspots\nthemselves), which seems to be symmetric for the ends of both jets. We consider\npossible explanations for this phenomenon, and conclude that it arises from\nhigh-energy electrons, recently accelerated in the nearby radio hotspots that\nare leaking into a pre-existing weakly-magnetized plasma that are symmetric\nrelic lobes fed from a previous episode of jet activity.

We find that all the scalar\nmodes are stable in the de Sitter background, due to two different kinds of\neffects, one from high-order derivatives of the spacetime curvature, and the\nother from the exponential expansion of the de Sitter space. Combining these\neffects properly, one can make the instability found in the Minkowski\nbackground never appear even for small-scale modes, provided that the IR limit\nis sufficiently closed to the relativistic fixed point. At the fixed point, all\nthe modes become stabilized. We also show that the instability of Minkowski\nspacetime can be cured by introducing mass to the spin-0 graviton.

We take into account saturated electron\nthermal conductivity and Bremsstrahlung energy losses of two temperature plasma\nfor density and temperature near the Bondi radius similar to those observed in\nM87 galaxy. Joint action of electron thermal conductivity and free-free\nradiation leads to the effective cooling of accreting plasma and formation of\nthe subsonic settling of accreting gas above the zone of a centrifugal barrier.\nA toroidal condensation and a hollow funnel that separates the torus from the\nblack hole emerge near the barrier. The barrier divides the flow into two\nregions: (1) the settling zone with slow subKeplerian rotation and (2) the zone\nwith rapid supersonic nearly Keplerian rotation. Existence of the centrifugal\nbarrier leads to significant decrease of the accretion rate dM/dt in comparison\nwith the critical Bondi solution for gamma=5/3.

In this work we study its spectral and timing\nproperties during the 2009 outburst based on Swift and RXTE data. Our spectral\nanalysis of the source indicates only slight spectral shape evolution during\nthe entire outburst. The equivalent width of the iron line and the apparent\narea of the blackbody emission associated with the hotspot at the stellar\nsurface both decrease significantly during the outburst. This is consistent\nwith a gradual receding of the accretion disc as the accretion rate drops. The\npulse profile analysis shows absence of dramatic shape evolution with a\nmoderate decrease in pulse amplitude. This behaviour might result from a\nmovement of the accretion column footprint towards the magnetic pole as the\ndisc retreats.

The\nmodulation significance of the light-curve above 30 MeV is at a sigma\nconfidence level and the light-curve is similar to those found earlier up to 30\nMeV by \\comp: a broad asymmetric first peak reaching its maximum 0.39 +/- 0.02\ncycles after the radio peak plus a second peak at 0.94 +/- 0.03.

At large separations, the tidal effect of the\nsecondary CO clears a gap. We show that the gap refills during the late\nGW-driven phase of the inspiral, leading to a sudden EM brightening of the\nsource. The accretion disk leaves an imprint on the GW through its angular\nmomentum exchange with the binary, the mass increase of the binary members due\nto accretion, and its gravity. We compute the disk-modified GWs both in an\nanalytical Newtonian approximation and in a numerical effective-one-body\napproach. We find that disk-induced migration provides the dominant\nperturbation to the inspiral, with weaker effects from the mass accretion onto\nthe CO and hydrodynamic drag. Depending on whether a gap is present, the\nperturbation of the GW phase is between 10 and 1000 radians per year,\ndetectable with the future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) at high\nsignificance.

Here we\ndiscuss the possibility that the high surface brightnesses observed are not due\nto star formation, but due to cosmological gas accretion. We assume that all of\nthe accretion energy is dissipated as shocks from the accreting gas.

Our unique data set has allowed us to demonstrate\nthat the selection method strongly influences the results, producing biases\nthat cannot be ignored. Almost all the BL Lac objects have been detected by\nFermi-LAT, whereas ~40% of the flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) in the\nradio, soft X-ray, and hard X-ray selected samples are still below the\ngamma-ray detection limit even after integrating 27 months of Fermi-LAT data.\nThe radio to sub-mm spectral slope of blazars is quite flat up to ~70GHz, above\nwhich it steepens to <\\alpha>~-0.65. BL Lacs have significantly flatter spectra\nthan FSRQs at higher frequencies. The distribution of the rest-frame\nsynchrotron peak frequency (\\nupS) in the SED of FSRQs is the same in all the\nblazar samples with <\\nupS>=10^13.1 Hz, while the mean inverse-Compton peak\nfrequency, <\\nupIC>, ranges from 10^21 to 10^22 Hz. The distributions of \\nupS\nand of \\nupIC of BL Lacs are much broader and are shifted to higher energies\nthan those of FSRQs and strongly depend on the selection method. The Compton\ndominance of blazars ranges from ~0.2 to ~100, with only FSRQs reaching values\n>3. Its distribution is broad and depends strongly on the selection method,\nwith gamma-ray selected blazars peaking at ~7 or more, and radio-selected\nblazars at values ~1, thus implying that the assumption that the blazar power\nis dominated by high-energy emission is a selection effect.

Spectral\nanalysis of halo orbits can be used to construct \"frequency maps\" which provide\na compact representation of the 6-dimensional phase space distribution\nfunction. Frequency maps identify important major orbit families, and the\norbital abundances reflect the shape and orientation of the dark matter halo\nrelative to the disk. We apply spectral analysis to halo orbits in a series of\ncontrolled simulations of disk galaxies. Although the shape of the simulated\nhalo varies with radius, frequency maps of local samples of halo orbits\nconfined to the inner halo contain most of the information about the global\nshape of the halo and its major orbit families. Quiescent or adiabatic disk\nformation results in significant trapping of halo orbits in resonant orbit\nfamilies (i.e. orbits with commensurable frequencies). If a good estimate of\nthe Galactic potential in the inner halo (within ~50kpc) is available, the\nappearance of strong, stable resonances in frequency maps of halo orbits will\nallow us to determine the degree of resonant trapping induced by the disk\npotential. The locations and strengths of these resonant families are\ndetermined both by the global shape of the halo and its distribution function.\nIdentification of such resonances in the Milky Way's stellar halo would\ntherefore provide evidence of an extended period of adiabatic disk growth. If\nthe Galactic potential is not known exactly, a measure of the diffusion rate of\nlarge sample of 10^4 halo orbits can help distinguish between the true\npotential and an incorrect potential.

Our\nsimulations cover a range of initial orbital characteristics and gas-to-stellar\nmass fractions (from 0 to 20%), and include star formation and supernova\nfeedback. We confirm and extend previous results by showing that the specific\nangular momentum of the stellar component always decreases independently of the\norbital parameters or morphology of the satellite, and that the decrease in the\nrotation velocity of the primary galaxy is accompanied by a change in the\nanisotropy of the orbits. However, the decrease affects only the old stellar\npopulation, and not the new population formed from gas during the merging\nprocess. This means that the merging process induces an increasing difference\nin the rotational support of the old and young stellar components, with the old\none lagging with respect to the new.

If, however, the dynamical equations contain a\nuniversal dimensional constant, such as the speed of light in vacuum $c$ or the\ngravitational constant $G$, then the requirement that its value remains the\nsame imposes a constraint on the rescaling, which reduces its number of free\nparameters by one, to $N_f = 2$. This is the case, for example, in\nmagneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) or special relativistic hydrodynamics, where $c$\nappears in the dynamical equations and forces the length and time units to\nscale by the same factor, or in Newtonian gravity where the gravitational\nconstant $G$ appears in the equations. More generally, when there are $N_{udc}$\nindependent (in terms of their units) universal dimensional constants, then the\nnumber of free parameters is $N_f = max(0,3-N_{udc})$. When both gravity and\nrelativity are included, there is only one free parameter ($N_f = 1$, as both\n$G$ and $c$ appear in the equations so that $N_{udc} = 2$), and the units of\nmass, length and time must all scale by the same factor. The explicit\nrescalings for different types of systems are discussed and summarized here.\nSuch rescalings of the units also hold for discrete particles, e.g. in N-body\nor particle in cell simulations. They are very useful when numerically\ninvestigating a large parameter space or when attempting to fit particular\nexperimental results, by significantly reducing the required number of\nsimulations. \n\n"}

Thus, a\ntiered series of such processes is required to bring gas to the smallest\nscales, each of which on its own may not correlate with the presence of an AGN.\nSimilarly, each may be associated with a starburst event, making it important\nto discriminate between 'circumnuclear' and 'nuclear' star formation.

For such events, the outer disk is very likely\nmisaligned with respect to the equatorial plane of the spinning SMBH, since the\nincoming star before disruption most likely has an inclined orbital plane.

Indirect detection\nmay provide a powerful test for some strongly motivated DM particle models.\nNevertheless, astrophysical backgrounds are usually expected with amplitudes\nand spectral features similar to the chased signals. On galactic scales, these\nbackgrounds arise from interactions of cosmic rays (CRs) with the interstellar\ngas, both being difficult to infer and model in detail from observations.\nMoreover, the associated predictions unavoidably come with theoretical errors,\nwhich are known to be significant. We show that a trustworthy guide for such\nchallenging searches can be obtained by exploiting the full information\ncontained in cosmological simulations of galaxies, which now include baryonic\ngas dynamics and star formation. We further insert CR production and transport\nfrom the identified supernova events and fully calculate the CR distribution in\na simulated galaxy.

This in turn implied that the\nneutrino driven wind is proton rich during its entire life, precluding\n$r$-process nucleosynthesis and the synthesis of Sr, Y, and Zr. This work\nrelied on charged current neutrino interaction rates that are appropriate for a\nfree nucleon gas. Here, it is shown in detail that the inclusion of the nucleon\npotential energies and collisional broadening of the response significantly\nalters this conclusion. Iso-vector interactions, which give rise to the nuclear\nsymmetry energy, produce a difference between the neutron and proton\nsingle-particle energies $\\Delta U=U_n-U_p$ and alter the kinematics of the\ncharged current reactions. In neutron-rich matter, and for a given\nneutrino/antineutrino energy, the rate for $\\nu_e+n\\rightarrow e^-+p$ is\nenhanced while $ \\bar{\\nu}_e+p\\rightarrow n+e^+$ is suppressed because the $Q$\nvalue for these reactions is altered by $\\pm\\Delta U$, respectively.

We discuss correlation between the temperature and\ncorresponding area of the thermal X-ray emission for a number of pulsars.\n  We have found that depending on the conditions in a polar cap region the gap\nbreakdown can be caused either by the Curvature Radiation (CR) or by the\nInverse Compton Scattering (ICS).

This second-generation formalism\nincorporates \"recursive nonlinearities\": the process by which\nalready-established metric perturbations will then act to slow down all future\nflows of inhomogeneity information. Here, the long-range effects of causal\nbackreaction are now damped, weakening its impact for models that were\npreviously best-fit cosmologies. Nevertheless, we find that causal backreaction\ncan be recovered as a replacement for Dark Energy via the adoption of larger\nvalues for the dimensionless `strength' of the clustering evolution functions\nbeing modeled -- a change justified by the hierarchical nature of clustering\nand virialization in the universe, occurring on multiple cosmic length scales\nsimultaneously. With this, and with one new model parameter representing the\nslowdown of clustering due to astrophysical feedback processes, an alternative\ncosmic concordance can once again be achieved for a matter-only universe in\nwhich the apparent acceleration is generated entirely by causal backreaction\neffects.

However, given the relatively low significance and\nastrometric accuracy of the radio detection, and the non-simultaneity of the\nX-ray and radio measurements, this identification required further\nconfirmation. Here we present deep, high angular resolution, strictly\nsimultaneous X-ray and radio observations of G1.

Lithium is easily destroyed by proton capture in stellar\nenvironments, so its abundance may be crucial to discriminate among different\nmodels proposed to account for multiple populations. In order to reproduce the\nobserved O-Na anticorrelation and other patterns typical of multiple\npopulations, the formation of second generation stars must occur from the\nnuclearly processed stellar ejecta, responsible of the chemical anomalies,\ndiluted with pristine gas having the composition of first generation stars. The\nlithium abundance in the unprocessed gas -which is very likely to be equal to\nthe lithium abundance emerging from the Big Bang- affects the lithium chemical\npatterns among the cluster stars. This paper focuses on a scenario in which\nprocessed gas is provided by asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. We examine\nthe predictions of this scenario for the lithium abundances of multiple\npopulations. We study the role of the non-negligible lithium abundance in the\nejecta of massive AGB (A(Li)~2), and, at the same time, we explore how our\nmodels can constrain the extremely large ---and very model dependent--- lithium\nyields predicted by recent super--AGB models. We show that the super--AGB\nyields may be tested by examining the lithium abundances in a large set of blue\nmain sequence stars in wCen and/or NGC2808.

We use\nspherically symmetric hydrodynamical models to estimate the accretion rate at\nlate times for a range of progenitor masses and radii and explosion energies.\nThe accretion rate onto the proto-neutron star or black hole decreases as Mdot\n~ t^-5/3 at late times, but its normalization can be significantly enhanced at\nlow explosion energies, in very massive stars, or if a strong reverse shock\nwave forms at the helium/hydrogen interface in the progenitor. If the resulting\nsuper-Eddington accretion drives an outflow which thermalizes in the outgoing\nejecta, the supernova debris will be re-energized at a time when photons can\ndiffuse out efficiently.

In these systems, the\ndominant tidal effects involve the excitation of gravity waves and their\ndissipation in the outer envelope of the star. We calculate the amplitude of\ntidally excited gravity waves in low-mass (0.3M_\\odot) helium-core (He) WDs as\na function of the tidal forcing frequency \\omega. Like carbon-oxygen (CO) WDs\nstudied in our previous paper, we find that the dimensionless tidal torque\nF(\\omega) (inversely proportional to the effective tidal quality factor) has an\nerratic dependence on \\omega. On average, F(\\omega) scales approximately as\n\\omega^6, and is several orders of magnitude smaller for He WDs than for CO\nWDs. We find that tidal torques can begin to synchronize the WD rotation when\nthe orbital period is less than about a hour, although a nearly constant\nasynchronization is maintained even at small periods. We examine where the\ntidally excited gravity waves experience non-linear breaking or resonant\nabsorption at a critical layer, allowing us to estimate the location and\nmagnitude of tidal heating in the WD envelope. We then incorporate tidal\nheating in the MESA stellar evolution code, calculating the physical conditions\nof the WD as a function of orbital period for different WD models. We find that\ntidal heating makes a significant contribution to the WD luminosity for\nshort-period (~10 min) systems such as SDSS J0651+2844. We also find that for\nWDs containing a hydrogen envelope, tidal heating can trigger runaway hydrogen\nshell burning, leading to a nova-like event before the onset of mass transfer. \n\n"}

In the linear regime, when\nthe electromagnetic back-reaction of the plasma is small enough, we show the\nexistence of an oscillating radial behavior for the flux surface function which\nvery closely resembles the one outlined in the local model, apart from a radial\nmodulation of the amplitude.

Results from a\n  Herschel-WISH survey Abstract: (Abridged) We present a survey of the water emission in a sample of more than\n20 outflows from low mass young stellar objects with the goal of characterizing\nthe physical and chemical conditions of the emitting gas. We have used the HIFI\nand PACS instruments on board the Herschel Space Observatory to observe the two\nfundamental lines of ortho-water at 557 and 1670 GHz. These observations were\npart of the \"Water In Star-forming regions with Herschel\" (WISH) key program,\nand have been complemented with CO and H2 data. We find that the emission from\nwater has a different spatial and velocity distribution from that of the J=1-0\nand 2-1 transitions of CO, but it has a similar spatial distribution to H2, and\nits intensity follows the H2 intensity derived from IRAC images. This suggests\nthat water traces the outflow gas at hundreds of kelvins responsible for the H2\nemission, and not the component at tens of kelvins typical of low-J CO\nemission. A warm origin of the water emission is confirmed by a remarkable\ncorrelation between the intensities of the 557 and 1670 GHz lines, which also\nindicates the emitting gas has a narrow range of excitations. A non-LTE\nradiative transfer analysis shows that while there is some ambiguity on the\nexact combination of density and temperature values, the gas thermal pressure\nnT is constrained within less than a factor of 2.

We\nfind a gradual decline in the gas temperature from 5 keV around NGC4839 to 3.6\nkeV at the radio relic, across which there is a further, steeper drop down to\n1.5 keV. This drop as well as the observed surface brightness profile are\nconsistent with a shock with Mach number M = 2.2 pm 0.5 and velocity vs = (1410\npm 110) km s^-1. A lower limit of B > 0.33 mu G is derived on the magnetic\nfield strength around the relic from upper limits to inverse Compton X-ray\nemission. Although this suggests that the non-thermal electrons responsible for\nthe relic are generated by diffusive shock acceleration (DSA), the relation\nbetween the measured Mach number and the electron spectrum inferred from radio\nobservations are inconsistent with that expected from the simplest,\ntest-particle theory of DSA. Nevertheless, DSA is still viable if it is\ninitiated by the injection of a pre-existing population of non-thermal\nelectrons.

Core collapse supernovae\n(SNe) and neutron star binary mergers are likely r-process sites, but little\nevidence yet exists for their in situ formation in such environments.

Such a remnant has been proposed as an\nexplanation for the late X-ray emission observed following some short duration\ngamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and as possible electromagnetic counterparts to the\ngravitational wave chirp. A stable NS merger remnant necessarily possesses a\nlarge rotational energy > 1e52 erg, the majority of which is ultimately\ndeposited into the surrounding circumburst medium (CBM) at mildly relativistic\nvelocities. We present Very Large Array radio observations of 7 short GRBs,\nsome of which possessed temporally extended X-ray emission, on timescales of\n~1-3 years following the initial burst. No radio sources were detected, with\ntypical upper limits ~0.3 mJy at 1.4 GHz. A basic model for the synchrotron\nemission from the blast wave is used to constrain the presence of a long-lived\nNS merger remnant in each system.

In order to better understand the origin of the gamma-ray\nemission and locate it within the galaxy, we studied contemporaneous\nmulti-frequency observations of NGC 1275 and modeled the overall spectral\nenergy distribution (SED).

The flux level and\nenergy spectra are similar to the results of the second campaign. The monthly\nlight curve >100 GeV shows a hint of variability at the 3.6 sigma level. In the\nFermi-LAT band, both flux and spectral shape variabilities are reported. The\noptical light curve is variable and shows a clear correlation with the\ngamma-ray flux >100 MeV.

Since the beam is intrinsically narrow (~1 deg), the associated\nemission region must be small for the observed BEC to avoid smearing out by\nspatial convolution. We estimate whether the energy available in the stream is\nsufficient to produce such a bright feature in the averaged profile. The energy\nconsiderations become complicated by the angular constraints imposed by the\nwidth of the microbeam, and by the specific spectrum of the BEC which is found\nto have the spectral index xi ~ -0.9 in comparison to the index of xi ~ -2 for\nthe total profile. For typical parameters, the luminosity of the BEC is\ndetermined to be 4 10^{25} erg/s, whereas the maximum-possible\nbeam-size-limited power of the stream is L_max ~ 2 10^{29} erg/s.

(2009), the met\nvalues given in Harris (2010) and a version of the former corrected via\nhigh-resolution spectroscopic met. Results. We calculated the calibration\nrelations for the two datasets and the three met scales and found that they are\napproximately equivalent, with differences almost negligible. We compared our\nnIR calibrations with the corresponding optical ones, and found them to be\nequivalent, establishing that the luminosity-corrected rEW using the Ks\nmagnitude is compatible with the one obtained from the V magnitude. We then\nused the met obtained from the calibration to investigate the internal met\ndistributions of the GCs. Conclusions. We have established that the\n([Fe/H]:rEW) relation is independent from the mag used for the luminosity\ncorrection and find that the calibration relations only change slightly for\ndifferent met scales. The CaT technique using NIR photometry is thus a powerful\ntool to derive met. In particular, it can be used to study the internal met\nspread of a GC. We confirm the presence of at least two met populations in NGC\n6656 and find that several other GCs present peculiar met distributions. \n\n"}

Abstract: We present the analysis of the extraordinarily bright Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB)\n130427A under the hypothesis that the GRB central engine is an\naccretion-powered magnetar. In this framework, initially proposed to explain\nGRBs with precursor activity, the prompt emission is produced by accretion of\nmatter onto a newly-born magnetar, and the observed power is related to the\naccretion rate. The emission is eventually halted if the centrifugal forces are\nable to pause accretion. We show that the X-ray and optical afterglow is well\nexplained as the forward shock emission with a jet break plus a contribution\nfrom the spin-down of the magnetar. Our modelling does not require any\ncontribution from the reverse shock, that may still influence the afterglow\nlight curve at radio and mm frequencies, or in the optical at early times. We\nderive the magnetic field ($B\\sim 10^{16}$ G) and the spin period ($P\\sim 20$\nms) of the magnetar and obtain an independent estimate of the minimum\nluminosity for accretion. This minimum luminosity results well below the prompt\nemission luminosity of GRB 130427A, providing a strong consistency check for\nthe scenario where the entire prompt emission is the result of continuous\naccretion onto the magnetar. This is in agreement with the relatively long spin\nperiod of the magnetar. GRB 130427A was a well monitored GRB showing a very\nstandard behavior and, thus, is a well-suited benchmark to show that an\naccretion-powered magnetar gives a unique view of the properties of long GRBs. \n\n"}

Unlike some previous works where non-diagonal\nelements of the covariance matrix were neglected, we use the full covariance\nmatrix of the SNIa data, thus obtaining more realistic and not underestimated\nerrors. As a matter of fact, the significance of previously claimed detections\nof a preferred direction in the Union2 dataset completely disappears once we\ninclude the effects of using the full covariance matrix. Moreover, we also find\nthat such a a preferred direction is aligned with the orthogonal direction of\nthe SDSS observational plane and this suggests a clear indication that the SDSS\nsubsample of the Union2 dataset introduces a significant biased, making the\ndetected preferred direction unphysical. We thus find that current SNIa surveys\nare inappropriate to test anisotropic features due to their highly\nnon-homogeneous angular distribution in the sky. In addition, after removal of\nthe highest inhomogeneous sub-samples, the number of SNIa is too low.

Such disks with barotropic equilibria can be\napproximately modeled using the shearing box framework, representing a small\ndisk volume with height-independent angular frequency. If the disk is in\nbaroclinic equilibrium, the angular frequency does generally depend on height,\nand it is thus necessary to go beyond the standard shearing box approach. In\nthis paper, we show that given a global disk model, it is possible to develop\napproximate models that are local in horizontal planes without an expansion in\nheight with shearing-periodic boundary conditions.

We model neutron stars with realistic equations of\nstate (notably through piecewise polytropic equations of state). Using these\nquasiequilibrium sequences we compute the binary's scalar charge and binding\nenergy versus orbital angular frequency. We find that the absolute value of the\nbinding energy is smaller than in general relativity (GR), differing at most by\n~14% at high frequencies for the cases considered. We use the newly computed\nbinding energy and the balance equation to estimate the number of\ngravitational-wave (GW) cycles during the adiabatic, quasicircular inspiral\nstage up to the end of the sequence, which is the last stable orbit or the\nmass-shedding point, depending on which comes first. We find that, depending on\nthe ST parameters, the number of GW cycles can be substantially smaller than in\nGR. In particular, we obtain that when dynamical scalarization sets in around a\nGW frequency of ~130 Hz, the sole inclusion of the ST binding energy causes a\nreduction of GW cycles from ~120 Hz up to the end of the sequence (~1200 Hz) of\n~11% with respect to the GR case. We estimate that when the ST energy flux is\nalso included the reduction in GW cycles becomes of ~24%. Quite interestingly,\ndynamical scalarization can produce a difference in the number of GW cycles\nwith respect to the GR point-particle case that is much larger than the effect\ndue to tidal interactions, which is on the order of only a few GW cycles.

Recent 3D simulations suggest that\nturbulence might play a crucial role in core-collapse supernova explosions,\nhowever the fidelity with which turbulence is simulated in these studies is\nunclear. Especially considering that the accuracy of ILES for the regime of\ninterest in CCSN, weakly compressible and strongly anisotropic, has not been\nsystematically assessed before.

We report a detailed analysis of the way in which the\nturbulent cascade is influenced by the numerics. Our results suggest that\nanisotropy and compressibility in CCSN turbulence have little effect on the\nturbulent kinetic energy spectrum and a Kolmogorov $k^{-5/3}$ scaling is\nobtained in the inertial range.

The kinematic properties of galaxies\nas traced by emission lines have been used to suggest the existence of a\nsignificant population of high-z star-forming galaxies consistent with isolated\nrotating disks. However, recent studies have cautioned that post-coalescence\nmergers may also display disk-like kinematics. To further investigate the\nrobustness of merger/disk classifications based on kinematic properties, we\ncarry out a systematic classification of 24 local (U)LIRGs spanning a range of\ngalaxy morphologies: from isolated spiral galaxies, ongoing interacting\nsystems, to fully merged remnants. We artificially redshift the WiFeS\nobservations of these local (U)LIRGs to z=1.5 to make a realistic comparison\nwith observations at high-z, and also to ensure that all galaxies have the same\nspatial sampling of ~900 pc. Using both kinemetry-based and visual\nclassifications, we find that the reliability of kinematic classification shows\na strong trend with the interaction stage of galaxies. Mergers with two nuclei\nand tidal tails have the most distinct kinematic properties compared to\nisolated disks, whereas a significant population of the interacting disks and\nmerger remnants are indistinguishable from isolated disks.

Newer versions of\nthe LAT datasets, instrument response functions and background models allow for\na more accurate analysis. Therefore it is important to re-evaluate the\npreviously analyzed time period along with the new data to further constrain\nlocation, spectral shape, and flux time history of the gamma-ray source. We\nconfirm earlier predictions of increasing flux values above 10 GeV toward the\nnext periastron passage.

We\nassess both the detectability of kilonovae and our ability to distinguish them\nfrom a wide range of contaminating transients. We find that if pre-existing\ntemplate images for the localization region are available, then nightly\nobservations to a depth of i=24 mag and z=23 mag are required to achieve a 95%\ndetection rate; observations that commence within 12 hours of trigger will also\ncapture the kilonova peak and provide stronger constraints on the ejecta\nproperties.

In the absence of a pre-existing template the observations must reach ~1\nmag deeper to achieve the same kilonova detection rate, but robust rejection of\ncontaminants can still be achieved.

We perform a multiwavelength\nphotometric and spectral study of the 2005 and 2008 reflares with data\ncollected during an observational campaign covering the near-infrared, optical,\nultra-violet and X-ray band.

We show that a Quark-Nova (QN; explosive transition\nof the neutron star to a quark star) occurring in a massive binary,\nexperiencing two Common Envelope (CE) phases, can quantitatively explain the\nlight curves of LSQ14bdq and SN 2006oz. The more massive component (A) explodes\nfirst as a normal SN, yielding a Neutron Star which ejects the hydrogen\nenvelope of the companion when the system enters its first CE phase. During the\nsecond CE phase, the NS spirals into and inflates the second He-rich CE. In the\nprocess it gains mass and triggers a Quark-Nova, outside of the CO core,\nleaving behind a Quark Star. The first hump in our model is the QN shock\nre-energizing the expanded He-rich CE. The QN occurs when the He-rich envelope\nis near maximum size (~ 1000R_sun) and imparts enough energy to unbind and\neject the envelope.

We first detected O2 and\nHOOH in the rho Ophiuchi cloud (core A), we now search for HOOH in Orion\nMolecular Cloud OMC A, where O2 has also been detected. Methods: We mapped a 3\narcmin times 3 arcmin region around Orion H2-Peak 1 with the Atacama Pathfinder\nExperiment (APEX). In addition to several maps in two transitions of HOOH, viz.\n219.17 GHz and 251.91 GHz, we obtained single-point spectra for another three\ntransitions towards the position of maximum emission. Results: Line emission at\nthe appropriate LSR-velocity (Local Standard of Rest) and at the level of\ngreater or equal to 4 sigma was found for two transitions, with lower S/N (2.8\n- 3.5 sigma) for another two transitions, whereas for the remaining transition,\nonly an upper limit was obtained. The emitting region, offset 18 arcsec south\nof H2-Peak 1, appeared point-like in our observations with APEX. Conclusions:\nThe extremely high spectral line density in Orion makes the identification of\nHOOH much more difficult than in rho Oph A.

The non-spherical shape of the disk as well as blocking of the\nneutron star by the disk and vice versa cause the observed flux to depend on\nthe inclination angle of the disk with respect to the line of sight. This is of\nspecial importance for the interpretation of Type I X-ray bursts, which are\npowered by the thermonuclear burning of matter accreted onto the neutron star.\nBecause part of the X-ray burst is reflected off the disk, the observed burst\nflux depends on the anisotropies for both direct emission from the neutron star\nand reflection off the disk. This influences measurements of source distance,\nmass accretion rate, and constraints on the neutron star equation of state.\nPrevious studies made predictions of the anisotropy factor for the total burst\nflux, assuming a geometrically flat disk. Recently, detailed observations of\ntwo exceptionally long bursts (so-called superbursts) allowed for the first\ntime for the direct and the reflected burst flux to each be measured, as\nopposed to just their sum. The ratio of the reflected and direct flux (the\nreflection fraction) was much higher than what the anisotropies of a flat disk\ncan account for. We create numerical models to calculate the anisotropy factors\nfor different disk shapes, including concave disks. We present the anisotropy\nfactors of the direct and reflected burst flux separately, as well as the\nanisotropy of the persistent flux. Reflection fractions substantially larger\nthan unity are produced in case the inner accretion disk steeply increases in\nheight, such that part of the star is blocked from view. Such a geometry could\npossibly be induced by the X-ray burst, if X-ray heating causes the inner disk\nto puff up. \n\n"}

Because the ejected material is extremely\nneutron-rich, the r-process rapidly synthesizes heavy nuclides as the material\nexpands and cools. In this work, we map general relativistic models of black\nhole-neutron star (BHNS) mergers into a Newtonian smoothed particle\nhydrodynamics (SPH) code and follow the evolution of the thermodynamics and\nmorphology of the ejecta until the outflows become homologous. We investigate\nhow the subsequent evolution depends on our mapping procedure and find that the\nresults are robust. Using thermodynamic histories from the SPH particles, we\nthen calculate the expected nucleosynthesis in these outflows while varying the\nlevel of neutrino irradiation coming from the postmerger accretion disk. We\nfind that the ejected material robustly produces r-process nucleosynthesis even\nfor unrealistically high neutrino luminosities, due to the rapid velocities of\nthe outflow. Nonetheless, we find that neutrinos can have an impact on the\ndetailed pat- tern of the r-process nucleosynthesis. Electron neutrinos are\ncaptured by neutrons to produce protons while neutron capture is occurring. The\nproduced protons rapidly form low mass seed nuclei for the r-process. These low\nmass seeds are eventually incorporated into the first r-process peak at A~78,\nproducing mainly Ge and Se. We consider the mechanism of this process in detail\nand discuss if it can impact galactic chemical evolution of the first peak\nr-process nuclei. \n\n"}

Here\nwe extend this analysis in three important directions: (i) we show that this\nresult applies to a large class of exotic compact objects with a photon sphere\nfor generic orbits in the test-particle limit; (ii) we investigate the\nlate-time ringdown in more detail, showing that it is universally characterized\nby a modulated and distorted train of \"echoes\" of the modes of vibration\nassociated with the photon sphere; (iii) we study for the first time\nequal-mass, head-on collisions of two ultracompact boson stars and compare\ntheir gravitational-wave signal to that produced by a pair of black-holes. If\nthe initial objects are compact enough as to mimic a binary black-hole\ncollision up to the merger, the final object exceeds the maximum mass for boson\nstars and collapses to a black-hole.

Our main\nfocus rests on exploring the effects of the interaction between ejecta and\ncircumstellar material on the ejecta evolution and the broad-band light curve.\nIn our calculations, we find that a strong reverse shock efficiently\ndecelerates and compresses the ejecta material. This leads to a significant\nbroadening of the optical light curve, a longer rise to maximum and a slower\ndecline in the tail phase. During the interaction, substantial radiative energy\nis generated, which mostly emerges in the extreme ultraviolet and X-ray regime.\nOnly if reprocessing due to radiation-matter interactions is very efficient, a\nsignificant boost in the optical light curve is observed.

However, the high velocities of unburned helium predicted by the model\n($\\sim 19,000$~km~s$^{-1}$) mean that the He I 10830 \\AA~feature may be\nconfused or blended with the C I 10690~\\AA~line forming at lower velocities.

Inferences from these surveys have called into question two\nlong-standing beliefs that the MCs : 1 are Virialised entities and (2) have\napproximately constant surface density i.e., the validity of the Larson's third\nlaw. In this work we invoke the framework of cloud-formation via collisions\nbetween warm gas flows. Post-collision clouds forming in these realisations\ncool rapidly and evolve primarily via the interplay between the Non-linear Thin\nShell Instability (NTSI), and the self-gravity. Over the course of these\nsimulations we traced the temporal evolution of the surface density of the\nassembled clouds, the fraction of dense gas, the distribution of gas column\ndensity (NPDF), and the Virial nature of the assembled clouds. We conclude,\nthese physical properties of MCs not only exhibit temporal variation, but their\nrespective peak-magnitude also increases in proportion with the magnitude of\nexternal pressure, $P_{ext}$. The velocity dispersion in assembled clouds\nappears to follow the power-law, $\\sigma_{gas}\\propto P_{ext}^{0.23}$. Also,\nthe power-law tail at higher densities becomes shallower with increasing\nmagnitude of external pressure, for magnitudes, $P_{ext}/k_{B}\\lesssim 10^{7}$\nK cm$^{-3}$, at higher magnitudes such as those typically found in the Galactic\nCMZ ($P_{ext}/k_{B} > 10^{7}$ K cm$^{-3}$), the power-law shows significant\nsteepening.

These three observational features provide unique\ninformation on the physics of core collapse and supernovae explosions within\ninteracting binary systems. There is suggestive evidence for a gap between ~2-5\nMsun in the observed mass distribution.

The difference between neutron star mass measurements in\nlow-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) and pulsar masses in high-mass X-ray binaries\n(HMXBs) reflect their different accretion histories, with the latter presenting\nvalues close to birth masses.

Much of this may be caused\nby the requirement that the gravitational sphere of influence of the black hole\nmust be resolved for the black-hole mass to be reliably estimated. We revisit\nthis issue by using a comprehensive galaxy evolution semi-analytic model, which\nself-consistently evolves supermassive black holes from high-redshift seeds via\ngas accretion and mergers, and also includes AGN feedback. Once tuned to\nreproduce the (mean) correlation of black-hole mass with velocity dispersion,\nthe model is unable to also account for the correlation with stellar mass. This\nbehaviour is independent of the model's parameters, thus suggesting an internal\ninconsistency in the data. The predicted distributions, especially at the\nlow-mass end, are also much broader than observed. However, if selection\neffects are included, the model's predictions tend to align with the\nobservations. We also demonstrate that the correlations between the residuals\nof the local scaling relations are more effective than the scaling relations\nthemselves at constraining AGN feedback models. In fact, we find that our\nsemi-analytic model, while in apparent broad agreement with the scaling\nrelations when accounting for selection biases, yields very weak correlations\nbetween their residuals at fixed stellar mass, in stark contrast with\nobservations.

The most popular models for the\nULXs involve either intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) or stellar-mass black\nholes accreting at super-Eddington rates. Here we review the ULX properties.\nTheir X-ray spectra indicate a presence of hot winds in their accretion disks\nsupposing the supercritical accretion. In recent years, new surprising results\nwere discovered in X-ray data, ULX-pulsars and high-velocity outflows up to 0.2\nc. They are also in accordance with the super-Eddington accretion. However, the\nstrongest evidences come from optical spectroscopy. The spectra of the ULX\ncounterparts are very similar to that of SS433, the only known supercritical\naccretor in our Galaxy. The spectra are apparently of WNL type (late nitrogen\nWolf-Rayet stars) or LBV (luminous blue variables) in their hot state, which\nare very scarce stellar objects. We find that the spectra do not originate from\nWNL/LBV type donors but from very hot winds from the accretion disks, which\nhave similar physical conditions as the stellar winds from these stars.

Meanwhile, the energy, helicity and twist stored in the\nmagnetosphere all gradually increase over the course of this evolution, until a\ncritical point is reached, beyond which a force-free magnetosphere cannot be\nconstructed. At this point, some large-scale magnetospheric rearrangement,\npossibly resulting in an outburst or a flare, must occur, releasing a large\nfraction of the stored energy, helicity and twist.

The properties of spiral arms are compared with respect\nto various galaxy properties. The star formation properties of galaxies vary\nsignificantly with arm number, but not pitch angle.

From our fully\ngeneral relativistic numerical computations of the structures of fast-spinning\ncompact stars, known as millisecond pulsars, we find that such a stellar\nconversion causes a simultaneous spin-up and decrease in gravitational mass of\nthese stars. This is a new type of millisecond pulsar evolution through a new\nmechanism, which gives rise to relatively lower mass compact stars with higher\nspin rates. This could have implication for the observed mass and spin\ndistributions of millisecond pulsars.

The case\n  of electron scattering Abstract: Bow shocks and related density enhancements produced by the winds of massive\nstars moving through the interstellar medium provide important information\nregarding the motions of the stars, the properties of their stellar winds, and\nthe characteristics of the local medium. Since bow shocks are aspherical\nstructures, light scattering within them produces a net polarization signal\neven if the region is spatially unresolved. Scattering opacity arising from\nfree electrons and dust leads to a distribution of polarized intensity across\nthe bow shock structure. That polarization encodes information about the shape,\ncomposition, opacity, density, and ionisation state of the material within the\nstructure. In this paper we use the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code SLIP to\ninvestigate the polarization created when photons scatter in a bow shock-shaped\nregion of enhanced density surrounding a stellar source. We present results\nassuming electron scattering, and investigate the polarization behaviour as a\nfunction of optical depth, temperature, and source of photons for two different\ncases: pure scattering and scattering with absorption. In both regimes we\nconsider resolved and unresolved cases.

We find\nthat the addition of the nonstandard neutrino self-interaction (NSSI) to the\nordinary V-A self-interaction between neutrinos is capable of dramatically\naltering the collective oscillations when its strength is comparable to the\nstandard, V-A, interaction. The effect of flavor-preserving (FP) NSSI is\ngenerally to suppress flavor transformation, while the flavor-violating (FV)\ninteractions are found to promote flavor transformations. If the neutrino\nsignal from a Galactic supernova can be sufficiently well understood, supernova\nneutrinos can provide complimentary constraints on scalar/pseudoscalar\ninteractions of neutrinos as well as distinguishing whether the neutrino is a\nMajorana or Dirac fermion. \n\n"}

These stars evolve on time scales of the order of\n40-60 Myr and eject matter strongly enriched in helium, owing to a deep\npenetration of the surface convective zone down to regions touched by CNO\nnucleosynthesis occurring after the core He-burning phase. Since the big\nunknown of the AGB phase of massive stars is the mass loss, we propose a new\napproch that takes into account the effects of the radiation pressure on dust\nparticles. We show that this more realistic description is able to reproduce\nthe observed abundances of Mg, Al, Na and Si in these extreme stars. The large\nspread in the oxygen abundances is explained by invoking deep mixing during the\nRGB phase. It will be possible to check this work hypothesis as soon as the\noxygen measurements of the main sequence stars of NGC2808 will be available. \n\n"}

While commonly\nattributed to the breakout of a supernova shock into a dense wind, the great\ndistances to the transients of this class found so far have hampered detailed\ninvestigation of their properties. We present photometry and spectroscopy from\na comprehensive worldwide campaign to observe AT2018cow (ATLAS18qqn), the first\nfast-luminous optical transient to be found in real time at low redshift. Our\nfirst spectra (<2 days after discovery) are entirely featureless. A very broad\nabsorption feature suggestive of near-relativistic velocities develops between\n3-8 days, then disappears. Broad emission features of H and He develop after\n>10 days. The spectrum remains extremely hot throughout its evolution, and the\nphotospheric radius contracts with time (receding below R<10^14 cm after 1\nmonth). This behaviour does not match that of any known supernova, although a\nrelativistic jet within a fallback supernova could explain some of the observed\nfeatures. Alternatively, the transient could originate from the disruption of a\nstar by an intermediate-mass black hole, although this would require\nlong-lasting emission of highly super-Eddington thermal radiation. In either\ncase, AT2018cow suggests that the population of fast luminous transients\nrepresents a new class of astrophysical event.

Lyman-$\\alpha$ coupling is\nassumed to be saturated, we therefore probe the nature of non-Gaussianities\nproduced by X-ray heating processes. We find the evolution of the normalised\nbispectrum to be very different from that of the power spectrum. It exhibits a\nturnover whose peak moves from large to small scales with decreasing redshift,\nand corresponds to the typical separation of emission regions. This\ncharacteristic scale reduces as more and more regions move into emission with\ntime. Ultimately, small-scale fluctuations within heated regions come to\ndominate the normalised bispectrum, which at the end of the simulation is\nalmost entirely driven by fluctuations in the density field.

The formation of compact object\nmergers in the isolated classical binary evolution favors initial binaries with\nstars of comparable masses (q = 0.5 $-$ 1) at intermediate orbital periods (log\nP (days) = 2 $-$ 4). New distributions slightly shift the mass ratios towards\nsmaller values with respect to the previously used flat q distribution, which\nis the dominant effect decreasing the rates. New orbital periods only\nnegligibly increase the number of progenitors. Additionally, we discuss the\nuncertainty of merger rate predictions associated with possible variations of\nthe massive-star initial mass function (IMF).

In this paper, we scrutinize the observational evidence for the\nincongruity between dwarf galaxies and the CDM model. To this end, we analyze\nthe rotation curves of 20 late-type dwarf galaxies studied by Swaters (1999).\nTaking the effects of beam-smearing and adiabatic contraction into account, we\nfit mass models to these rotation curves with dark matter halos with different\ncusp slopes, ranging from constant density cores to r^{-2} cusps. Uncertainties\nin the stellar mass-to-light ratio and the limited spatial sampling of the\nhalo's density distribution hamper a unique mass decomposition. Consequently,\nthe rotation curves in our sample cannot be used to discriminate between dark\nhalos with constant density cores and r^{-1} cusps. We show that the dwarf\ngalaxies analyzed here are consistent with cold dark matter halos in a LCDM\ncosmology, and that there is thus no need to abandon the idea that dark matter\nis cold and collisionless. However, the data is also consistent with any\nalternative dark matter model that produces dark matter halos with central\ncusps less steep than r^{-1.5}.

This dip is placed in a way so\nas to mimic the loss of power in the WDM model: both models have the same\nintegrated power out to the scale where the power of the Dip model rises to the\nlevel of the unperturbed CDM spectrum again.\n  Using N-body simulations we show that some of the large-scale clustering\npatterns of this new model follow more closely the usual CDM scenario while\nsimultaneously suppressing small scale structures (within galactic halos) even\nmore efficiently than WDM. The analysis in the paper shows that the new Dip\nmodel appears to be a viable alternative to WDM but it is based on different\nphysics. Where WDM requires the introduction of a new particle species the Dip\nmodel is based on a non-standard inflationary period.

In agreement\nwith previous studies, we find that relativistic jets are collimated by their\npassage through the stellar mantle. Interaction of these jets with the star and\ntheir own cocoons also causes mixing that sporadically decelerates the flow. We\nspeculate that this mixing instability is chiefly responsible for the variable\nLorentz factor needed in the internal shock model and for the complex light\ncurves seen in many GRBs. In all cases studied, the jet is shocked deep inside\nthe star following a brief period of adiabatic expansion. The jet that finally\nemerges from the star thus has a moderate Lorentz factor, modulated by mixing,\nand a very large internal energy. In a second series of calculations, we follow\nthe escape of that sort of jet. Because of the large ratio of internal to\nkinetic energy in both the jet and its cocoon, the opening angle of the final\njet is significantly greater than at breakout. A small amount of material\nemerges at large angles, but with a Lorentz factor still sufficiently large to\nmake a weak GRB. This leads us to propose a \"unified model\" in which a variety\nof high energy transients, ranging from x-ray flashes to \"classic\" GRBs, may be\nseen depending upon the angle at which a standard collapsar is observed. We\nalso speculate that the breakout of a relativistic jet and its collision with\nthe stellar wind will produce a brief transient with properties similar to the\nclass of \"short-hard\" GRBs.

This also allows the\nmeasurement of CIB based on integrated intensity, whose theoretical prediction\nis based on energy conservation, thus is fairly model independent and robust.\nThe redshift information of CIB sources can be directly recovered with the aid\nof galaxy photometric redshifts.

This time dependent model reproduces the\nmain features of the rapid multi-wavelength variability of XTE J1118+480.\nAssuming that the energy is stored in the form of magnetic field, we find that\nthe required values of the model parameters are compatible with both a patchy\ncorona atop a cold accretion disc and a hot thick inner disc geometry.

Current measurement of the orbital inclination allows the\nmillisecond pulsar (A) to pass very close (at R_{min}=4000 km) in projection to\nthe companion pulsar (B), with R_{min} comparable to the Einstein radius (2600\nkm). For this separation at the conjunction, lensing causes small (about 10%)\nmagnification of the pulsar A signal on a timescale of several seconds, and\ndisplaces the pulsar image on the sky plane by about 1200 km. More importantly,\nlensing introduces a correction (of several microsec) to the conventional\nShapiro delay formula used in pulsar timing analysis, and gives rise to a\ngeometric time delay together with the delays associated with the pulsar spin\nperiod. These lensing effects can influence the determination of the system\nparameters by both timing and scintillation studies.

This is only the second clear example of a\nsubstantially supersonic merger shock front in clusters. Comparison of the\nX-ray image with that of the previously known radio halo reveals a coincidence\nof the leading edge of the halo with the bow shock, offering an interesting\nexperimental setup for determining the role of shocks in the radio halo\ngeneration. The halo in A520 apparently consists of two spatially distinct\nparts, the main turbulence-driven component and a cap-like forward structure\nrelated to the shock, where the latter may provide pre-energized electrons for\nsubsequent turbulent re-acceleration. The radio edge may be caused by electron\nacceleration by the shock. If so, the synchrotron spectrum should have a slope\nof 1.2 right behind the edge with quick steepening further away from the edge.\nAlternatively, if shocks are inefficient accelerators, the radio edge may be\nexplained by an increase in the magnetic field and density of pre-existing\nrelativistic electrons due to gas compression. In the latter model, there\nshould be radio emission in front of the shock with the same spectrum as that\nbehind it, but 10-20 times fainter. If future sensitive radio measurements do\nnot find such pre-shock emission, then the electrons are indeed accelerated (or\nre-accelerated) by the shock, and one will be able to determine its\nacceleration efficiency. We also propose a method to estimate the magnetic\nfield strength behind the shock, based on measuring the dependence of the radio\nspectral slope upon the distance from the shock. In addition, the radio edge\nprovides a way to constrain the diffusion speed of the relativistic electrons. \n\n"}

We first show that at least a sizable fraction\nof the flares cannot be related to external shock mechanisms, since external\nshock flares evolve on much longer time scales than observed.

Typically at a metallicity $Z=0.001$ only 9% of the total\nmass returned by non-rotating massive stars is ejected by winds (91% by\nsupernovae explosion), while at solar metallicity this fraction may amount to\nmore than 40%.

Keck spectra of the arc show Ly alpha emission\nat 7204 Angstrom, a continuum drop blueward of the line, and several absorption\nlines to the red. We identify the arc as a gravitationally lensed galaxy at a\nredshift of z=4.92. It is the highest redshift object currently known. A\ngravitational lens model was used to reconstruct images of the high-redshift\ngalaxy. The reconstructed image is asymmetric, containing a bright knot and a\npatch of extended emission 0.4 arcsec from the knot. The effective radius of\nthe bright knot is 0.022 arcsec or 130 h^-1 pc. The extended patch is partially\nresolved into compact regions of star formation. The reconstructed galaxy has\nI_AB= 24, giving a bolometric luminosity of about 3e11 Lsun. This can be\nproduced by a star formation rate of 36 h^-2 Msun /yr (q0=0.5), or by an\ninstantaneous star burst of 3e8 Msun. The spectral lines show velocity\nvariations on the order of 300 km/s along the arc. The Si II line is blue\nshifted with respect to the Ly alpha emission, and the Ly alpha emission line\nis asymmetric with a red tail. These spectral features are naturally explained\nby an outflow model, in which the blue side of the Ly alpha line has been\nabsorbed by outflowing neutral H I. Evidence from other sources indicates that\noutflows are common in starburst galaxies at high and low redshift.

We have studied the Optical Transient, which accompanied the\ngamma-ray burst of May 8, 1997 (GRB 970508).

This brackets all other\npublished observations, including radio. When analyzed in conjunction with\noptical data from other observatories, evidence emerges for a composite light\ncurve. The first interval, from 3 to 8 hours after the event was characterized\nby a constant, or slowly declining brightness. At a later moment the brightness\nstarted increasing rapidly, and reached a maximum approximately 40 hours after\nthe GRB.

The density of interstellar gas in the\nMilky Way is shown to vary non-monotonically with radius, and so contributes\nsignificantly to the local gradient of the rotation curve. We have therefore\ncalculated mass models for the Milky Way that include this component, and have\nderived the corresponding radial variation in the Oort constants. Between\n0.9R_0 and 1.2R_0, the Oort functions, A(R) and B(R), differ significantly from\nthe general Theta/R dependence. Various previously-inexplicable observations\nare shown to be consistent with these predictions. These models can explain the\n40% difference between the values for 2 A R_0 derived from radial velocity data\noriginating in the inner and outer Galaxy. They also go some way toward\nexplaining the different shapes of the velocity ellipsoids of giant and dwarf\nstars in the solar neighbourhood.

Our low value for R_0 agrees well\nwith the only direct determination (7.2 +/- 0.7 kpc, Reid 1993). Using these\nGalactic constants, we find that the proper motion of Sgr A^* is consistent\nwith the observational constraints.

We find that the running\nof the Higgs mass, couplings and the vacuum term inevitably result in a scaling\ndependence of the observable CC value. As a consequence one meets a nonzero CC\nat an energy scale comparable to the typical electron neutrino mass suggested\nby some experiments, and the order of magnitude of this constant is roughly the\none derived from recent supernovae observations. However the sign of it is\nnegative -- opposite to what is suggested by these observations. This\ndiscrepancy may be a hint of the existence of an extra very light scalar,\nperhaps a Cosmon-like dilaton, which should essentially decouple from the SM\nLagrangian, but that it nevertheless could mediate new macroscopic forces in\nthe submillimeter range. \n\n"}

We show that, for the M-theory motivated potentials,\nthe cosmic acceleration of the universe can be eternal if the spatial curvature\nof the 4d spacetime is negative, while the acceleration is only transient for a\nspatially flat universe. We also comment on the size of the internal space and\nits associated geometric bounds on massive Kaluza-Klein excitations. \n\n"}
{"id": "hep-th/0605229", "contents": "Title: Quantum phantom cosmology Abstract: We apply the formalism of quantum cosmology to models containing a phantom\nfield. Three models are discussed explicitly: a toy model, a model with an\nexponential phantom potential, and a model with phantom field accompanied by a\nnegative cosmological constant. In all these cases we calculate the classical\ntrajectories in configuration space and give solutions to the Wheeler-DeWitt\nequation in quantum cosmology. In the cases of the toy model and the model with\nexponential potential we are able to solve the Wheeler-DeWitt equation exactly.\nFor comparison, we also give the corresponding solutions for an ordinary scalar\nfield. We discuss in particular the behaviour of wave packets in\nminisuperspace. For the phantom field these packets disperse in the region that\ncorresponds to the Big Rip singularity. This thus constitutes a genuine quantum\nregion at large scales, described by a regular solution of the Wheeler-DeWitt\nequation. For the ordinary scalar field, the Big-Bang singularity is avoided.\nSome remarks on the arrow of time in phantom models as well as on the relation\nof phantom models to loop quantum cosmology are given. \n\n"}

Abstract: This is a sequel to a previous detailed study of quantum corrections to\ncosmological correlations.

It is shown here that at least in\nperturbation theory these corrections can nevertheless not be proportional to\npositive powers of the Robertson--Walker scale factor, but only at most to\npowers of its logarithm, and are therefore never large. \n\n"}

We discuss a particular form of $\\kappa$-Minkowski phase space\nalgebra that yields the $\\kappa$-extended finite Lorentz transformations\nderived in \\cite{kim}. This is a particular form of a Deformed Special\nRelativity model that admits a modified energy-momentum dispersion law as well\nas noncommutative $\\kappa$-Minkowski phase space. We show that this system can\nbe completely mapped to a set of phase space variables that obey canonical (and\n{\\it{not}} $\\kappa$-Minkowski) phase space algebra and Special Relativity\nLorentz transformation (and {\\it{not}} $\\kappa$-extended Lorentz\ntransformation). The complete set of deformed symmetry generators are\nconstructed that obeys an unmodified closed algebra but induce deformations in\nthe symmetry transformations of the physical $\\kappa$-Minkowski phase space\nvariables. Furthermore, we demonstrate the usefulness and simplicity of this\napproach through a number of phenomenological applications both in classical\nand quantum mechanics.
