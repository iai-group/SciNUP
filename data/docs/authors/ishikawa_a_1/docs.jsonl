Abstract: An extension of the Standard Model by three singlet fermions with masses\nsmaller than the electroweak scale allows to explain simultaneously neutrino\noscillations, dark matter and baryon asymmetry of the Universe.

To describe\nthe overlap of two colliding heavy ions we have applied the time-dependent\ncolor field with a pulse-like shape.

In this short review article, we outline, using\nflavor-dependent sleptons as an example, how flavor can affect both searches\nfor supersymmetry, and future measurements aimed at understanding the nature of\nany new discoveries. If the production cross-sections for supersymmetry are\nrelatively low, as indicated by the fact that it has not revealed itself yet in\nstandard searches, the usual assumptions about the superpartner spectra need\nre-thinking. Furthermore, one must consider more intricate searches, such as\nlepton-based searches, which could be susceptible to flavor effects. We start\nby reviewing the flavor structure of existing frameworks for mediating\nsupersymmetry breaking, emphasizing flavor-dependent models proposed recently.\nWe use the kinematic endpoints of invariant mass distributions to demonstrate\nhow flavor dependence can impact both searches for supersymmetry and the\nInverse Problem. We also discuss methods for measuring small-mass splittings\nand mixings at the LHC, both in models with a neutralino LSP and in models with\na charged slepton (N)LSP. \n\n"}

Abstract: We consider the possibility that the new particle that has been observed at\n125 GeV is not the Standard Model (SM) Higgs, but instead the dilaton\nassociated with an approximate conformal symmetry that has been spontaneously\nbroken. We focus on dilatons that arise from theories of technicolor, or from\ntheories of the Higgs as a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB), that involve\nstrong conformal dynamics in the ultraviolet. In the pNGB case, we are\nconsidering a framework where the Higgs particle is significantly heavier than\nthe dilaton and has therefore not yet been observed. In each of the technicolor\nand pNGB scenarios, we study both the case when the SM fermions and gauge\nbosons are elementary, and the case when they are composites of the strongly\ninteracting sector. Our analysis incorporates conformal symmetry violating\neffects, which are necessarily present since the dilaton is not massless, and\nis directly applicable to a broad class of models that stabilize the weak scale\nand involve strong conformal dynamics. Since the AdS/CFT correspondence relates\nthe radion in Randall-Sundrum (RS) models to the dilaton, our results also\napply to RS models with the SM fields localized on the infrared brane, or in\nthe bulk. We identify the parameters that can be used to distinguish the\ndilatons associated with the several different classes of theories being\nconsidered from each other, and from the SM Higgs. We perform a fit to all the\navailable data from several experiments and highlight the key observations to\nextract these parameters.

Due to pressure both from scientists requesting more details on\nincreasingly complex nanostructures, as well as the ever improving\ninstrumentation leaving less margin for ambiguity, small-angle scattering\nmethodologies have been evolving at a high pace over the last few decades.\n  As the quality of any results can only be as good as the data that goes into\nthese methodologies, the improvements in data collection and all imaginable\ndata correction steps are reviewed here. This work is intended to provide a\ncomprehensive overview of all data corrections, to aid the small-angle\nscatterer to decide which are relevant for their measurement and how these\ncorrections are performed. Clear mathematical descriptions of the corrections\nare provided where feasible. Furthermore, as no quality data exists without a\ndecent estimate of its precision, the error estimation and propagation through\nall these steps is provided alongside the corrections. With these data\ncorrections, the collected small-angle scattering pattern can be made of the\nhighest standard allowing for authoritative nanostructural characterisation\nthrough its analysis.

The\nsevere drought in the US in the summer of 2012 led to a new increase in food\nprices. Through the fall, they remained at a threshold above which the riots\nand revolutions had predominantly occurred. Global prices at this level create\nconditions where an exacerbating local circumstance can trigger unrest. Global\ncorn (maize) prices reached new highs, and countries that depend mostly on\nmaize are more likely to experience high local food prices and associated\npressures toward social unrest. Here we analyze the conditions in South Africa,\nwhich is a heavily maize-dependent country. Coinciding with increased consumer\nfood indices this summer, massive labor strikes in mining and agriculture have\nled to the greatest single incident of social violence since the fall of\napartheid in 1994. Worker demands for dramatic pay increases reflect that their\nwages have not kept up with drastic increases in the prices of necessities,\nespecially food. Without attention to the global food price situation, more\nincidents of food-based social instability are likely to arise. Other countries\nthat have manifested food-related protests and riots in 2012 include Haiti and\nArgentina. Moreover, these cases of unrest are just the most visible symptom of\nwidespread suffering of poor populations worldwide due to elevated food prices.\nPolicy decisions that would directly impact food prices are decreasing the\nconversion of maize to ethanol in the US, and reimposing regulations on\ncommodity futures markets to prevent excessive speculation, which we have shown\ncauses bubbles and crashes in these markets. Absent such policy actions,\ngovernments and companies should track and mitigate the impact of high and\nvolatile food prices on citizens and employees. \n\n"}

This\nquestion has been a subject of intense debate and controversy, ever since, in\n2008, it was claimed that such a gauge-invariant split was, in fact, possible.\nWe explain in what sense this claim is true and how it turns out that one of\nthe main problems is that such a decomposition is not unique and therefore\nraises the question of what is the most natural or physical choice.

A model of\nmulti-layer flow network is proposed for modelling and analyzing multiple types\nof flows in flow systems. Then, flow distances are introduced, and symmetric\nminimum flow distance is presented. Subsequently, we discuss the establishment\nof the multi-layer flow networks of international trade from two coupled\nviewpoints, i.e., the viewpoint of commodity flow and that of money flow. Thus,\nthe multi-layer flow networks of international trade is explored. First,\ntrading \"trophic levels\" are adopted to depict positions that economies\noccupied in the flow network. We find that the distributions of trading\n\"trophic levels\" have the similar clustering pattern for different types of\ncommodity, and there are some regularities between money flow network and\ncommodity flow network. Second, we find that active and competitive countries\ntrade a wide spectrum of products, while inactive and underdeveloped countries\ntrade a limited variety of products. Besides, some abnormal countries import\nmany types of goods, which the vast majority of countries do not need to\nimport. It may indicate an abnormal economic status. Third, harmonic node\ncentrality is proposed and we find the phenomenon of centrality stratification.\nIt means that competitive countries tend to occupy the central positions in the\ntrading of a large variety of commodities, while underdeveloped countries\nlikely in the peripheral positions in the trading of their limited varieties of\nproducts. Fourth, we find that manufactured products have significant larger\nmean first-passage flow distances from the source to the sink than that of\nprimary products. \n\n"}

The performance in\nmeasuring the ZH cross section using events in which the Higgs boson recoils\nagainst a Z boson which decays into a pair of muons or electrons has been\ndemonstrated based on full simulation of the ILD detector for three center of\nmass energies 250, 350, and 500 GeV, and two beam polarizations (Pe-,Pe+)\n=(-80%, +30%) and (+80%, -30%).

We show that a pseudoscalar\naxion coupled to the topological density of hypercharge, suggested in the past\nby Brustein and Oaknin as a candidate for inducing baryogenesis, can explain\nthe signal in the diphoton channel. The hypercharge axion (HCA) can also decay\nto $Z\\gamma$ and $ZZ$. The expected number of events in these channels is too\nsmall to have been detected, but such decays should be observed in the future.\nThe HCA can be produced via vector boson fusion (VBF) or via associated\nproduction (AP). The latter should be manifested by a characteristic decay to 3\nphotons which should be observed soon. We adapt the previous analysis of\npossible detection of the HCA at the LHC by Brustein and Oaknin and by Elfgren\nto the case that the mass of the HCA is 750 GeV and find the expected cross\nsection and decay width in terms of the HCA coupling.

The tension is caused because for both VBF and AP the production\ncross-section and the decay width depend linearly on each other.

{"id": "1610.01826", "contents": "Title: Phenomenological Implications of Very Special Relativity Abstract: We discuss several phenomenological implications of Very Special Relativity\n(VSR). It is assumed that there is a small violation of Lorentz invariance and\nthe true symmetry group of nature is a subgroup called SIM(2). This symmetry\ngroup postulates the existence of a fundamental or preferred direction in\nspace-time. We study its implications by using an effective action which\nviolates Lorentz invariance but respects VSR. We find that the problem of\nfinding the masses of fundamental fermions is in general intractable in the\npresence of VSR term. The problem can be solved only in special cases which we\npursue in this paper. We next determine the signal of VSR in torsion pendulum\nexperiment as well as clock comparison experiment. We find that VSR predicts a\nsignal which is different from other Lorentz violating theories and hence a\ndedicated data analysis is needed in order to impose reliable limits. Assuming\nthat signal is absent in data we determine the limits that can be imposed on\nthe VSR parameters. We also study the implications of VSR in particle decay\nexperiments taking the charged pion and kaon decay as an example. The effective\ninteraction between the charged pion and the final state leptons is related to\nthe fundamental VSR mass terms through a loop calculation. We also predict a\nshift in the angular dependence of the decay products due to VSR. In particular\nwe find that these no longer display azimuthal symmetry with respect to the\nmomentum of the pion. Furthermore the azimuthal and polar angle distributions\nshow time dependence with a period of a sidereal day. This time dependence\nprovides us with a novel method to test VSR in future experiments. \n\n"}

Beyond this\nscale lies the realm of new physics needed to remedy problems that arise at\nhigher energies, the TeV scale and above. Supersymmetry (SUSY) is the most\nfavored extension of the Standard Model that solves many of its limitations, if\npredicted SUSY particles exist at the TeV scale. The Large Hadron Collider\n(LHC) at CERN has opened a new phase of exploration into new physics at the TeV\nscale after increasing the center-of-mass energy of the proton-proton\ncollisions to 13 TeV. The ATLAS experiment has collected this collision data\nwith over 90% efficiency due to the excellent performance of many of its\nsystems, in particular the data acquisition system. The work described in this\ndissertation ensures the efficient collection of ATLAS data as well as the\nanalysis of this data to search for SUSY. The search for strongly produced\nsupersymmetric particles decaying into final states with multiple energetic\njets and either two leptons (electrons or muons) with the same electric charge\nor at least three leptons was performed using the proton-proton collision\ndataset of 36 fb$^{-1}$ at 13 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector in 2015 and\n2016.

Our analysis depicts a\nstrongly modular system, with several groups of firms specializing in the\nexport of specific categories of products. These clusters have been detected by\nrunning the bipartite variant of the traditional modularity maximization,\nrevealing a bi-modular structure. Interestingly, this finding is refined by\napplying a recently-proposed algorithm for projecting bipartite networks on the\nlayer of interest and, then, running the Louvain algorithm on the resulting\nmonopartite representations. Important structural differences emerge upon\ncomparing the Colombian firms-products network with the World Trade Web, in\nparticular, the bipartite representation of the latter is not characterized by\na similar block-structure, as the modularity maximization fails in revealing\n(bipartite) nodes clusters. This points out that economic systems behave\ndifferently at different scales: while countries tend to diversify their\nproduction --potentially exporting a large number of different products-- firms\nspecialize in exporting (substantially very limited) baskets of basically\nhomogeneous products. \n\n"}

Due to the reduction of\nthe available phase space volume per quantum mode at short wavelengths, the\nequation of state of ultrarelativistic particles stiffens at very high\ndensities. This causes a stronger than usual deceleration of the scale factor\nwhich competes with a higher than usual propagation speed of the particles.\nVarious measures for the effective propagation speed are analyzed: the group\nand phase velocity in the high energy tail, the thermal average of the group\nand phase velocity, and the speed of sound. Of these three groups, only the\nfirst provides a possible solution to the cosmological horizon problem. \n\n"}

In this paper we present a study of the impact of the\nquantization error in CMB experiments using, as a working case, simulated data\nfrom the Planck/LFI. At TOD level, the effect of the quantization can be\napproximated as a source of nearly normally distributed noise. At map level,\nthe data quantization alters the noise distribution and the expectation of some\nhigher order moments. Finally, at the levell of power spectra, the quantization\nintroduces a power excess, that, although related to the instrument and mission\nparameters, is weakly dependent on the multipole l at middle and large l and\ncan be quite accurately subtracted, leaving a residual uncertainty of few % of\nthe RMS uncertainty.

{"id": "astro-ph/0310473", "contents": "Title: Particle decays during the cosmic dark ages Abstract: We consider particle decays during the cosmic dark ages with two aims: (1) to\nexplain the high optical depth reported by WMAP, and (2) to provide new\nconstraints to the parameter space for decaying particles. We delineate the\ndecay channels in which most of the decay energy ionizes and heats the IGM gas\n(and thus affects the CMB), and those in which most of the energy is carried\naway -- e.g. photons with energies 100 keV < E < 1 TeV -- and thus appears as a\ncontribution to diffuse x-ray and gamma-ray backgrounds. The new constraints to\nthe decay-particle parameters from the CMB power spectrum thus complement those\nfrom the cosmic X-ray and gamma-ray backgrounds. Although decaying particles\ncan indeed produce an optical depth consistent with that reported by WMAP, in\nso doing they produce new fluctuations in the CMB temperature/polarization\npower spectra.

{"id": "math/0605461", "contents": "Title: On Stable Pareto Laws in a Hierarchical Model of Economy Abstract: This study considers a model of the income distribution of agents whose\npairwise interaction is asymmetric and price-invariant. Asymmetric transactions\nare typical for chain-trading groups who arrange their business such that\ncommodities move from senior to junior partners and money moves in the opposite\ndirection. The price-invariance of transactions means that the probability of a\npairwise interaction is a function of the ratio of incomes, which is\nindependent of the price scale or absolute income level. These two features\ncharacterize the hierarchical model. The income distribution in this class of\nmodels is a well-defined double-Pareto function, which possesses Pareto tails\nfor the upper and lower incomes. For gross and net upper incomes, the model\npredicts definite values of the Pareto exponents, $a_{\\rm gross}$ and $a_{\\rm\nnet}$, which are stable with respect to quantitative variation of the\npair-interaction. The Pareto exponents are also stable with respect to the\nchoice of a demand function within two classes of status-dependent behavior of\nagents: linear demand ($a_{\\rm gross}=1$, $a_{\\rm net}=2$) and unlimited slowly\nvarying demand ($a_{\\rm gross}=a_{\\rm net}=1$). For the sigmoidal demand that\ndescribes limited returns, $a_{\\rm gross}=a_{\\rm net}=1+\\alpha$, with some\n$\\alpha>0$ satisfying a transcendental equation. The low-income distribution\nmay be singular or vanishing in the neighborhood of the minimal income; in any\ncase, it is $L_1$-integrable and its Pareto exponent is given explicitly.\n  The theory used in the present study is based on a simple balance equation\nand new results from multiplicative Markov chains and exponential moments of\nrandom geometric progressions. \n\n"}

Because of\nthis, $v_2$ fluctuations can be used to estimate the Knudsen number of the\nsystem produced at RHIC. To illustrate this quantitatively, we apply the UrQMD\nmodel, with scaled cross sections, to show that collisions at RHIC have a\nKnudsen number at least one order of magnitude above the expected value for an\ninteracting hadron gas.

For\nmesoscopic times the bulk of the distribution (more than 99% of the\nprobability) follows an exponential law. At longer times, the exponential law\ncontinuously evolves into Gaussian distribution.\n  After characterizing the stock returns at mesoscopic time lags, we study the\nsubordination hypothesis. The integrated volatility V_t constructed from the\nnumber of trades process can be used as a subordinator for a Brownian motion.\nThis subordination is able to describe approximatly 85% of the stock returns\nfor time lags that start at 1 hour but are shorter than one day. Finally, we\nshow that the CIR process describes well enough the empirical V_t process, such\nthat the corresponding Heston model is able to describe the log-returns x_t\nprocess, with approximately the maximum quality that the subordination allows.\n  Finally, we study the time evolution of the personal income distribution.
