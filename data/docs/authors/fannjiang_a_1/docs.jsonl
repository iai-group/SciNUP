For example, knowledge of how these objects formed can be used to\nimpose constraints on planetary formation theories. We have recently proposed a\nbinary-object formation model based on the notion of chaos-assisted capture.\nHere we present a more detailed analysis with calculations performed in the\nspatial (three-dimensional) three- and four-body Hill approximations. It is\nassumed that the potential binary partners are initially following heliocentric\nKeplerian orbits and that their relative motion becomes perturbed as these\nobjects undergo close encounters. First, the mass, velocity, and orbital\nelement distribu- tions which favour binary formation are identified in the\ncircular and elliptical Hill limits. We then consider intruder scattering in\nthe circular Hill four-body problem and find that the chaos-assisted capture\nmechanism is consistent with observed, apparently randomly distributed, binary\nmutual orbit inclinations. It also predicts asymmetric distributions of\nretrograde versus prograde orbits. The time-delay induced by chaos on particle\ntransport through the Hill sphere is analogous to the formation of a resonance\nin a chemical reaction.

This development is partly defining the\nemerging field of optofluidics. Scaling analysis and experiments have\ndemonstrated the advantage of micro-scale devices over their macroscopic\ncounterparts for a number of chemical applications.

The\ndynamical behavior of the iterates of the map on the boundary of the Siegel\ndisk exhibits strong scaling properties which have been intensively studied in\nthe physical and mathematical literature.\n  In the cases we study, the boundary of the Siegel disk is a Jordan curve\ncontaining a critical point of the map (we consider critical maps of different\norders), and there exists a natural parameterization which transforms the\ndynamics on the boundary into a rotation. We compute numerically this\nparameterization and use methods of harmonic analysis to compute the global\nHolder regularity of the parameterization for different maps and rotation\nnumbers.\n  We obtain that the regularity of the boundaries and the scaling exponents are\nuniversal numbers in the sense of renormalization theory (i.e., they do not\ndepend on the map when the map ranges in an open set), and only depend on the\norder of the critical point of the map in the boundary of the Siegel disk and\nthe tail of the continued function expansion of the rotation number.

More\nexplicitly their defining conditions read: 1) elements in the same column\ncommute; 2) commutators of the cross terms are equal: $[M_{ij}, M_{kl}] =\n[M_{kj}, M_{il}]$ (e.g. $[M_{11},M_{22}] = [M_{21},M_{12}]$).

In\nparticular, it utilizes these two measures of coherence to provide an in-depth\nanalysis of a simple one-step thresholding (OST) algorithm for model selection.\nOne of the key insights offered by the ensuing analysis is that OST is feasible\nfor model selection as long as the design matrix obeys an easily verifiable\nproperty.

The former optical medium is deduced from the stereographic projection of\na virtual sphere and displays a heterogeneous refractive index n(r) which is\nproportional to the inverse of 1+r^2. The latter is described by a homogeneous,\nbut negative, refractive index. It has been suggested that the fisheye makes a\nperfect lens without negative refraction [Leonhardt, Philbin\narxiv:0805.4778v2]. However, we point out that the definition of\nsuper-resolution in such a heterogeneous medium should be computed with respect\nto the wavelength in a homogenized medium, and it is perhaps more adequate to\ntalk about a conjugate image rather than a perfect image (the former does not\nnecessarily contains the evanescent components of the source). We numerically\nfind that both the Maxwell fisheye and a thick silver slab lens lead to a\nresolution close to lambda/3 in transverse magnetic polarization (electric\nfield pointing orthogonal to the plane).

We use this quantum\nmechanical interpretation to give a new quantum algorithm for computing the\nJones polynomial. This algorithm is useful for its conceptual simplicity, and\nit applies to all values of the polynomial variable that lie on the unit circle\nin the complex plane. Letting C(K) denote the Hilbert space for this model,\nthere is a natural unitary transformation U from C(K) to itself such that <K> =\n<F|U|F> where |F> is a sum over basis states for C(K). The quantum algorithm\narises directly from this formula via the Hadamard Test. We then show that the\nframework for our quantum model for the bracket polynomial is a natural setting\nfor Khovanov homology. The Hilbert space C(K) of our model has basis in\none-to-one correspondence with the enhanced states of the bracket state\nsummmation and is isomorphic with the chain complex for Khovanov homology with\ncoefficients in the complex numbers.

In\norder to sustain a given fluctuation, a system traverses a precise optimal path\nin phase space.

This opens an unexplored route\ntoward a deeper understanding of nonequilibrium physics by bringing symmetry\nprinciples to the realm of fluctuations. We illustrate this concept studying\nsymmetries of the current distribution out of equilibrium.

{"id": "1107.3500", "contents": "Title: Quantum Reading Capacity Abstract: The readout of a classical memory can be modelled as a problem of quantum\nchannel discrimination, where a decoder retrieves information by distinguishing\nthe different quantum channels encoded in each cell of the memory [S.\nPirandola, Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 090504 (2011)]. In the case of optical\nmemories, such as CDs and DVDs, this discrimination involves lossy bosonic\nchannels and can be remarkably boosted by the use of nonclassical light\n(quantum reading). Here we generalize these concepts by extending the model of\nmemory from single-cell to multi-cell encoding. In general, information is\nstored in a block of cells by using a channel-codeword, i.e., a sequence of\nchannels chosen according to a classical code. Correspondingly, the readout of\ndata is realized by a process of \"parallel\" channel discrimination, where the\nentire block of cells is probed simultaneously and decoded via an optimal\ncollective measurement. In the limit of an infinite block we define the quantum\nreading capacity of the memory, quantifying the maximum number of readable bits\nper cell. This notion of capacity is nontrivial when we suitably constrain the\nphysical resources of the decoder. For optical memories (encoding bosonic\nchannels), such a constraint is energetic and corresponds to fixing the mean\ntotal number of photons per cell. In this case, we are able to prove a\nseparation between the quantum reading capacity and the maximum information\nrate achievable by classical transmitters, i.e., arbitrary classical mixtures\nof coherent states. In fact, we can easily construct nonclassical transmitters\nthat are able to outperform any classical transmitter, thus showing that the\nadvantages of quantum reading persist in the optimal multi-cell scenario. \n\n"}

Given a system and a real function (observable) defined on\nits phase space, extreme value theory studies the limit probabilistic laws\nobeyed by large values attained by the observable along orbits of the system.\nBased on this theory, the so-called block maximum method is often used in\napplications for statistical prediction of large value occurrences. In this\nmethod, one performs inference for the parameters of the Generalised Extreme\nValue (GEV) distribution, using maxima over blocks of regularly sampled\nobservations along an orbit of the system. The observables studied so far in\nthe theory are expressed as functions of the distance with respect to a point,\nwhich is assumed to be a density point of the system's invariant measure.\nHowever, this is not the structure of the observables typically encountered in\nphysical applications, such as windspeed or vorticity in atmospheric models. In\nthis paper we consider extreme value limit laws for observables which are not\nfunctions of the distance from a density point of the dynamical system. In such\ncases, the limit laws are no longer determined by the functional form of the\nobservable and the dimension of the invariant measure: they also depend on the\nspecific geometry of the underlying attractor and of the observable's level\nsets.

As a large fraction of the population will be exposed to\nradiation, low-dose imaging is essential. Iterative image reconstruction based\non solving an optimization problem, such as Total-Variation minimization, shows\npotential for reconstruction from sparse-view data. For iterative methods it is\nimportant to ensure convergence to an accurate solution, since important image\nfeatures, such as presence of microcalcifications indicating breast cancer, may\nnot be visible in a non-converged reconstruction, and this can have clinical\nsignificance. To prevent excessively long computational times, which is a\npractical concern for the large image arrays in CT, it is desirable to keep the\nnumber of iterations low, while still ensuring a sufficiently accurate\nreconstruction for the specific imaging task. This motivates the study of\naccurate convergence criteria for iterative image reconstruction. In simulation\nstudies with a realistic breast phantom with microcalcifications we compare\ndifferent convergence criteria for reliable reconstruction. Our results show\nthat it can be challenging to ensure a sufficiently accurate microcalcification\nreconstruction, when using standard convergence criteria. In particular, the\ngray level of the small microcalcifications may not have converged long after\nthe background tissue is reconstructed uniformly.

For microcalcifications we find empirically\na large correlation between nonzero gradient components and non-converged\nvariables, which occur precisely within the microcalcifications.

A primary objective is to generalize the Manakov\nequations, well known in the case of single-mode fibers. We first investigate a\nreference case where linear coupling among the spatial modes of the fiber is\nweak and after averaging over birefringence fluctuations, we obtain new Manakov\nequations for multimode fibers. Such an averaging reduces the number of\nintermodal nonlinear terms drastically since all four-wave-mixing terms average\nout. Cross-phase modulation terms still affect multimode transmission but their\neffectiveness is reduced. We then verify the accuracy of our new Manakov\nequations by transmitting multiple PDM-QPSK signals over different modes of a\nmultimode fiber and comparing the numerical results with those obtained by\nsolving the full stochastic equation. The agreement is excellent in all cases\nstudied. A great benefit of the new equations is to reduce the computation time\nby a factor of 10 or more.

The\nwavelet and Fourier transform domains are not incoherent because low-order\nwavelets and low-order frequencies are correlated, so compressive sensing\ntheory does not immediately imply sampling strategies and reconstruction\nguarantees. In this paper we turn to a more refined notion of coherence -- the\nso-called local coherence -- measuring for each sensing vector separately how\ncorrelated it is to the sparsity basis. For Fourier measurements and Haar\nwavelet sparsity, the local coherence can be controlled and bounded explicitly,\nso for matrices comprised of frequencies sampled from a suitable inverse square\npower-law density, we can prove the restricted isometry property with\nnear-optimal embedding dimensions.

In the noise-free setting we derive a general expression on the\nnumber of measurements needed to ensure that a unique solution can be found in\na stable way, that depends on the set T through a natural complexity parameter.\nThis parameter can be computed explicitly for many sets T of interest. For\nexample, for k-sparse inputs we show that O(k\\log(n/k)) measurements are\nneeded, and when x can be any vector in R^n, O(n) measurements suffice. In the\nnoisy case, we show that if one can find a value for which the empirical risk\nis bounded by a given, computable constant (that depends on the set T), then\nthe error with respect to the true input is bounded above by an another,\nclosely related complexity parameter of the set. By choosing an appropriate\nnumber N of measurements, this bound can be made arbitrarily small, and it\ndecays at a rate faster than N^{-1/2+\\delta} for any \\delta>0. In particular,\nfor k-sparse vectors stable recovery is possible from O(k\\log(n/k)\\log k) noisy\nmeasurements, and when x can be any vector in R^n, O(n \\log n) noisy\nmeasurements suffice. We also show that the complexity parameter for the\nquadratic problem is the same as the one used for analyzing stability in linear\nmeasurements under very general conditions. Thus, no substantial price has to\nbe paid in terms of stability if there is no knowledge of the phase. \n\n"}

Examples include recovering\nsparse or group-sparse vectors, low-rank matrices, and the sum of sparse and\nlow-rank matrices, among others. In various applications in signal processing\nand machine learning, the model of interest is known to be structured in\nseveral ways at the same time, for example, a matrix that is simultaneously\nsparse and low-rank.\n  Often norms that promote each individual structure are known, and allow for\nrecovery using an order-wise optimal number of measurements (e.g., $\\ell_1$\nnorm for sparsity, nuclear norm for matrix rank). Hence, it is reasonable to\nminimize a combination of such norms. We show that, surprisingly, if we use\nmulti-objective optimization with these norms, then we can do no better,\norder-wise, than an algorithm that exploits only one of the present structures.\nThis result suggests that to fully exploit the multiple structures, we need an\nentirely new convex relaxation, i.e. not one that is a function of the convex\nrelaxations used for each structure. We then specialize our results to the case\nof sparse and low-rank matrices. We show that a nonconvex formulation of the\nproblem can recover the model from very few measurements, which is on the order\nof the degrees of freedom of the matrix, whereas the convex problem obtained\nfrom a combination of the $\\ell_1$ and nuclear norms requires many more\nmeasurements. This proves an order-wise gap between the performance of the\nconvex and nonconvex recovery problems in this case. Our framework applies to\narbitrary structure-inducing norms as well as to a wide range of measurement\nensembles. This allows us to give performance bounds for problems such as\nsparse phase retrieval and low-rank tensor completion. \n\n"}

In\npractice, one is interested in developing techniques for detection of such\ntransitions from sparse observations, possibly contaminated by noise. In this\npaper we develop a framework to accurately tag different regimes of complex\nsystems based on topological features. In particular, our framework works with\na high degree of success in picking out a cyclically orbiting regime from a\nstationary equilibrium regime in high-dimensional stochastic dynamical systems. \n\n"}

Many computationally efficient\ngreedy algorithms have been developed to solve the problem of best $s$-sparse\napproximation. The design of all of these algorithms employ a similar template\nof exploiting the RIP and computing projections onto the space of sparse\nvectors.

We show that if $A \\in\n\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}$ satisfies SRIP and phaseless measurements $|Ax_0| = b$\nare observed about a $k$-sparse signal $x_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, then minimizing\nthe $\\ell_1$ norm subject to $ |Ax| = b $ recovers $x_0$ up to multiplication\nby a global sign. Moreover, we establish that the SRIP holds for the random\nGaussian matrices typically used for standard compressed sensing, implying that\nphaseless compressed sensing is possible from $O(k \\log (n/k))$ measurements\nwith these matrices via $\\ell_1$ minimization over $|Ax| = b$.

One example is the spectrally-sparse signal, which is composed of a\nsmall number of spectral atoms with arbitrary frequencies on the unit interval.\nIn this paper we study the problem of line spectrum denoising and estimation\nwith an ensemble of spectrally-sparse signals composed of the same set of\ncontinuous-valued frequencies from their partial and noisy observations. Two\napproaches are developed based on atomic norm minimization and structured\ncovariance estimation, both of which can be solved efficiently via semidefinite\nprogramming.

From the\nperspective of Schur-Weyl duality, it becomes evident that the computation of\nmatrix integrals over the unitary group is intricately intertwined with the\nso-called Weingarten function. The explicit evaluation of this function is\nheavily dependent on three crucial aspects: firstly, the dimensions of the\nirreducible representations of the unitary groups; secondly, the dimensions of\nthe irreducible representations of permutation groups; and thirdly, the\nirreducible characters of permutation groups.

For example, in\ncompressed sensing with the standard (synthesis) sparsity prior and in matrix\ncompletion, the number of measurements needed is proportional (up to a\nlogarithmic factor) to the signal's manifold dimension.\n  Recently, a new natural low-dimensional signal model has been proposed: the\ncosparse analysis prior.

The jet groups serve as finite-dimensional models\nof the diffeomorphism group itself, and so the jetlet particles serve as a\nfinite-dimensional model of the self-similarity exhibited by ideal\nincompressible fluids.

This has implications for\ntools such as Optimal Power Flow (OPF), an optimization problem widely used in\npower system operations and planning, which should be adjusted to account for\nthis uncertainty. One way to handle the uncertainty is to formulate a Chance\nConstrained OPF (CC-OPF) which limits the probability of constraint violation\nto a predefined value. However, existing CC-OPF formulations and solutions are\nnot immune to drawbacks. On one hand, they only consider affine policies for\ngeneration control, which are not always realistic and may be sub-optimal. On\nthe other hand, the standard CC-OPF formulations do not distinguish between\nlarge and small violations, although those might carry significantly different\nrisk. In this paper, we introduce the Weighted CC-OPF (WCC-OPF) that can handle\ngeneral control policies while preserving convexity and allowing for efficient\ncomputation.

We\nalso prove that the scattered field profile can be effectively controlled by\nchanging B.\n  The second part of the thesis is devoted to the study of light-matter\ninteractions mediated by fluctuations of the vacuum EM field. Firstly, we\ndemonstrate that the Purcell effect can be effectively suppressed for an\nexcited atom near a cloaking device. Furthermore, the decay rate of a quantum\nemitter near a graphene-coated wall under the influence of an external magnetic\nfield is studied. We show that the MO properties of graphene strongly affect\nthe atomic lifetime and that B allows for an unprecedented control of the decay\nchannels of the system. In addition, we discuss the dispersive interaction\nbetween an atom and suspended graphene in a magnetic field. For large\natom-graphene separations and low temperatures we show that the interaction\nenergy is a quantized function of B. Besides, we show that at room temperature,\nthermal effects must be taken into account even in the extreme near-field\nregime.\n  Finally, the third part of the thesis deals with the study of near-field heat\ntransfer.

We show that the heat transfer can be strongly enhanced at the\npercolation phase transition.

When measurements are\ncorrupted by noise during signal acquisition and transmission, 1bit-CS is\nusually modeled as minimizing a loss function with a sparsity constraint.

{"id": "1510.00105", "contents": "Title: Are quantum spin Hall edge modes more resilient to disorder, sample\n  geometry and inelastic scattering than quantum Hall edge modes? Abstract: On the surface of 2D Topological insulators occur 1D quantum spin Hall(QSH)\nedge modes with Dirac like dispersion. Unlike quantum Hall(QH) edge modes which\noccur at high magnetic fields in 2DEGs, the occurrence of QSH edge modes is\nbecause of spin-orbit scattering in the bulk of the material. These QSH edge\nmodes are spin dependent and chiral- opposite spins move in opposing\ndirections. Electronic spin has larger decoherence and relaxation time than\ncharge- in view of this its expected that QSH edge modes will be more robust to\ndisorder and inelastic scattering than QH edge modes which are charge dependent\nand spin unpolarized. However, we notice no such advantage accrues to QSH edge\nmodes when subjected to same degree of contact disorder and/or inelastic\nscattering in similar setups as QH edge modes. In fact we observe that QSH edge\nmodes are more susceptible to inelastic scattering and contact disorder than QH\nedge modes. Further, while a single disordered contact has no effect on QH edge\nmodes it leads to a finite charge Hall current in case of quantum spin Hall\nedge modes and thus vanishing of pure quantum spin Hall effect. For more than a\nsingle disordered contact while quantum Hall states continue to remain immune\nto disorder, quantum spin Hall edge modes become more susceptible- the Hall\nresistance for quantum spin Hall effect changes sign with increasing disorder.\nIn case of many disordered contacts with inelastic scattering included while\nquantization of Hall edge modes holds, for quantum spin Hall edge modes- a\nfinite charge Hall current still flows. For quantum spin Hall edge modes in the\ninelastic scattering regime we distinguish between two cases: with spin-flip\nand without spin-flip scattering. Finally, while asymmetry in sample geometry\ncan have a deleterious effect on quantum spin Hall case it has no impact in\nquantum Hall case. \n\n"}

A key parameter of their dynamics is the\neffective-detuning of the pump laser to the thermally- and Kerr-shifted cavity\nresonance. Together with the free spectral range and dispersion, it governs the\nsoliton-pulse duration, as predicted by an approximate analytical solution of\nthe Lugiato-Lefever equation. Yet, a precise experimental verification of this\nrelation was lacking so far. Here, by measuring and controlling the\neffective-detuning, we establish a new way of stabilizing solitons in\nmicroresonators and demonstrate that the measured relation linking soliton\nwidth and detuning deviates by less than 1 % from the approximate expression,\nvalidating its excellent predictive power.

Most of the\nsolution procedures proposed until now are either computationally very\nexpensive or applicable to only small classes of bilevel optimization problems\nadhering to mathematically simplifying assumptions.

We seek the triggers as the probabilistically feasible solutions of an\nappropriately constrained optimization problem, where the function to be\nmaximized is a system observable exhibiting intermittent extreme bursts.

We apply the method to a body-forced\nincompressible Navier--Stokes equation, known as the Kolmogorov flow.

Quantum coherence has recently\nbeen investigated rigorously within a resource-theoretic formalism. However,\nthe finer-grained notion of multilevel coherence, which explicitly takes into\naccount the number of superposed classical states, has remained relatively\nunexplored. A comprehensive analysis of multi-level coherence, which acts as\nthe single-party analogue to multi-partite entanglement, is essential for\nunderstanding natural quantum processes as well as for gauging the performance\nof quantum technologies. Here we develop the theoretical and experimental\ngroundwork for characterizing and quantifying multilevel coherence.

In particular, steering of\ncontinuous variable Gaussian states has been extensively studied as a\nmanifestation of the EPR paradox. While most of these studies focused on\nquadrature measurements for steering detection, two recent works revealed that\nthere exist Gaussian states which are only steerable by non-Gaussian\nmeasurements. In this paper we perform a systematic investigation of EPR\nsteering of bipartite Gaussian states by pseudospin measurements, complementing\nand extending previous findings. We first derive the density matrix elements of\ntwo-mode squeezed thermal states in the Fock basis, which may be of independent\ninterest. We then use such a representation to investigate steering of these\nstates as detected by a nonlinear criterion, based on second moments of the\npseudospin correlation matrix. This analysis reveals previously unexplored\nregimes where non-Gaussian measurements are more effective than Gaussian ones\nto witness steering of Gaussian states in the presence of local noise. We\nfurther consider an alternative set of pseudospin observables, whose\nexpectation value can be expressed compactly in terms of Wigner functions for\nall two-mode Gaussian states.

Finally, we investigate continuous variable\nWerner states, which are non-Gaussian mixtures of Gaussian states, and find\nthat pseudospin measurements are always more effective than Gaussian ones to\nreveal their steerability. Our results provide useful insights on the role of\nnon-Gaussian measurements in characterizing quantum correlations of Gaussian\nand non-Gaussian states. \n\n"}

In contrast, we propose a new and very general framework, called Smart\n\"Predict, then Optimize\" (SPO), which directly leverages the optimization\nproblem structure, i.e., its objective and constraints, for designing better\nprediction models. A key component of our framework is the SPO loss function\nwhich measures the decision error induced by a prediction.\n  Training a prediction model with respect to the SPO loss is computationally\nchallenging, and thus we derive, using duality theory, a convex surrogate loss\nfunction which we call the SPO+ loss. Most importantly, we prove that the SPO+\nloss is statistically consistent with respect to the SPO loss under mild\nconditions. Our SPO+ loss function can tractably handle any polyhedral, convex,\nor even mixed-integer optimization problem with a linear objective. Numerical\nexperiments on shortest path and portfolio optimization problems show that the\nSPO framework can lead to significant improvement under the\npredict-then-optimize paradigm, in particular when the prediction model being\ntrained is misspecified.

A more general problem is the\nmultispectral phase retrieval problem, where sums of these magnitudes are\nobserved instead. In this paper we study the proximal operator for this\nproblem, which appears in applications like X-ray solution scattering. We show\nthat despite its non-convexity, all local minimizers are global minimizers,\nguaranteeing the optimality of simple descent techniques.

These moons are\nthought to have been captured into planetocentric orbits after straying into a\nregion in which the planet's gravitation dominates solar perturbations (the\nHill sphere). This mechanism requires a source of dissipation, such as\ngas-drag, in order to make capture permanent. However, capture by gas-drag\nrequires that particles remain inside the Hill sphere long enough for\ndissipation to be effective. Recently we have proposed that in the circular\nrestricted three-body problem particles may become caught up in `sticky'\nchaotic layers which tends to prolong their sojourn within the planet's Hill\nsphere thereby assisting capture.

Based on recent systematic searches it has\nbeen estimated that up to 10% of Kuiper-belt objects might be binaries.\nHowever, all examples discovered to-date are unusual, as compared to near-Earth\nand main-belt asteroid binaries, for their mass ratios of order unity and their\nlarge, eccentric orbits. In this article we propose a common dynamical origin\nfor these compositional and orbital properties based on four-body simulations\nin the Hill approximation. Our calculations suggest that binaries are produced\nthrough the following chain of events: initially, long-lived quasi-bound\nbinaries form by two bodies getting entangled in thin layers of dynamical chaos\nproduced by solar tides within the Hill sphere. Next, energy transfer through\ngravitational scattering with a low-mass intruder nudges the binary into a\nnearby non-chaotic, stable zone of phase space. Finally, the binary hardens\n(loses energy) through a series of relatively gentle gravitational scattering\nencounters with further intruders. This produces binary orbits that are well\nfitted by Kepler ellipses. Dynamically, the overall process is strongly favored\nif the original quasi-bound binary contains comparable masses. We propose a\nsimplified model of chaotic scattering to explain these results.

Under\ndisturbance, the constants are endowed with time dependence. The Lagrange\nconstraint is then imposed to guarantee that the functional dependence of the\nperturbed velocity on the time and constants stays the same as in the\nundisturbed case. Constants obeying this condition are called osculating\nelements. The constants chosen to be canonical are called Delaunay elements, in\nthe orbital case, or Andoyer elements, in the spin case. (As some Andoyer\nelements are time dependent even in the free-spin case, the role of constants\nis played by their initial values.) The Andoyer and Delaunay sets of elements\nshare a feature not readily apparent: in certain cases the standard equations\nrender them non-osculating. In orbital mechanics, elements furnished by the\nstandard planetary equations are non-osculating when perturbations depend on\nvelocities. To preserve osculation, the equations must be amended with extra\nterms that are not parts of the disturbing function. In the case of Delaunay\nparameterisation, these terms destroy canonicity. So under velocity-dependent\ndisturbances, osculation and canonicity are incompatible. (Efroimsky and\nGoldreich 2003, 2004) Similarly, the Andoyer elements turn out to be\nnon-osculating under angular-velocity-dependent perturbation. Amendment of only\nthe Hamiltonian makes the equations render nonosculating elements. To make them\nosculating, more terms must enter the equations (and the equations will no\nlonger be canonical).

{"id": "gr-qc/0206037", "contents": "Title: Complexifier Coherent States for Quantum General Relativity Abstract: Recently, substantial amount of activity in Quantum General Relativity (QGR)\nhas focussed on the semiclassical analysis of the theory. In this paper we want\nto comment on two such developments: 1) Polymer-like states for Maxwell theory\nand linearized gravity constructed by Varadarajan which use much of the Hilbert\nspace machinery that has proved useful in QGR and 2) coherent states for QGR,\nbased on the general complexifier method, with built-in semiclassical\nproperties. We show the following: A) Varadarajan's states {\\it are}\ncomplexifier coherent states. This unifies all states constructed so far under\nthe general complexifier principle. B) Ashtekar and Lewandowski suggested a\nnon-Abelean generalization of Varadarajan's states to QGR which, however, are\nno longer of the complexifier type. We construct a new class of non-Abelean\ncomplexifiers which come close to the one underlying Varadarajan's\nconstruction. C) Non-Abelean complexifiers close to Varadarajan's induce new\ntypes of Hilbert spaces which do not support the operator algebra of QGR. The\nanalysis suggests that if one sticks to the present kinematical framework of\nQGR and if kinematical coherent states are at all useful, then normalizable,\ngraph dependent states must be used which are produced by the complexifier\nmethod as well. D) Present proposals for states with mildened graph dependence,\nobtained by performing a graph average, do not approximate well coordinate\ndependent observables. However, graph dependent states, whether averaged or\nnot, seem to be well suited for the semiclassical analysis of QGR with respect\nto coordinate independent operators. \n\n"}

These conditions arise from a\nsimple ``Principle of Perturbative Agreement'': For interaction Lagrangians\n$L_1$ that are such that the interacting field theory can be constructed\nexactly--as occurs when $L_1$ is a ``pure divergence'' or when $L_1$ is at most\nquadratic in the field and contains no more than two derivatives--then\ntime-ordered products must be defined so that the perturbative solution for\ninteracting fields obtained from the Bogoliubov formula agrees with the exact\nsolution. The conditions derived from this principle include a version of the\nLeibniz rule (or ``action Ward identity'') and a condition on time-ordered\nproducts that contain a factor of the free field $\\phi$ or the free\nstress-energy tensor $T_{ab}$. The main results of our paper are (1) a proof\nthat in spacetime dimensions greater than 2, our new conditions can be\nconsistently imposed in addition to our previously considered conditions and\n(2) a proof that, if they are imposed, then for {\\em any} polynomial\ninteraction Lagrangian $L_1$ (with no restriction on the number of derivatives\nappearing in $L_1$), the stress-energy tensor $\\Theta_{ab}$ of the interacting\ntheory will be conserved.

Contrary to what is\nwidely assumed, the density of excited emitters and the intensity in an\nemission decay curve are not proportional, but the density is a time-integral\nof the intensity. The integral relation is crucial to correctly interpret\nnon-single-exponential decay. We derive the proper normalization for both a\ndiscrete, and a continuous distribution of rates, where every decay component\nis multiplied with its radiative decay rate. A central result of our paper is\nthe derivation of the emission decay curve in case that both radiative and\nnon-radiative decays are independently distributed. In this case, the\nwell-known emission quantum efficiency can not be expressed by a single number\nanymore, but it is also distributed. We derive a practical description of\nnon-single-exponential emission decay curves in terms of a single distribution\nof decay rates; the resulting distribution is identified as the distribution of\ntotal decay rates weighted with the radiative rates. We apply our analysis to\nrecent examples of colloidal quantum dot emission in suspensions and in\nphotonic crystals, and we find that this important class of emitters is well\ndescribed by a log-normal distribution of decay rates with a narrow and a broad\ndistribution, respectively. Finally, we briefly discuss the Kohlrausch\nstretched-exponential model, and find that its normalization is ill-defined for\nemitters with a realistic quantum efficiency of less than 100 %. \n\n"}

The present paper\nproposes a new approach to the problem, namely quantization in terms of the\ngroup SO(1,2): The crucial point is that the phase space S^2 = {phi mod 2pi,\nI>0} has the global structure S^1 x R^+ (a simple cone) and cannot be quantized\nin the conventional manner. As the group SO(1,2) acts appropriately on that\nspace its unitary representations of the positive discrete series provide the\ncorrect quantum theoretical framework. The space S^2 has the conic structure of\nan orbifold R^2/Z_2. That structure is closely related to the center Z_2 of the\nsymplectic group Sp(2,R). The basic variables on S^2 are the functions h_0 = I,\nh_1 = I cosphi and h_2 = -I sinphi, the Poisson brackets of which obey the Lie\nalgebra so(1,2). In the quantum theory they are represented by self-adjoint\ngenerators K_0, K_1 and K_2 of a unitary representation. A crucial prediction\nis that the classical Pythagorean relation h_1^2+h_2^2 = h_0^2 may be violated\nin the quantum theory. For each representation one can define 3 different types\nof coherent states the complex phases of which can be \"measured\" by means of\nK_1 and K_2 alone without introducing any new phase operators!
