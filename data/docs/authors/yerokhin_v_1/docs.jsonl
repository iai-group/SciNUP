We demonstrate that the cascade term\nnaturally leads to a nearly Lorentzian shape of the two-photon profiles in the\nvicinity of the resonances. However, due to quantum-electrodynamical\ncorrections, the two-photon emission spectra deviate significantly from the\nLorentzian shape in the very distant wings of the resonances. We investigate up\nto which distance the two-photon profiles are close to a Lorentzian and discuss\nthe role of the interference term. We then analyze how the deviation of the\ntwo-photon profiles from the Lorentzian shape affects the dynamics of\ncosmological hydrogen recombination. Since in this context the escape of\nphotons from the Lyman-alpha resonance plays a crucial role, we concentrate on\nthe two-photon corrections in the vicinity of the Lyman-alpha line.

Calculations have\nbeen performed for nS, nP and nD states which are commonly used in a variety of\nexperiments, at principal quantum numbers n=8-65 and at the three ambient\ntemperatures of 77, 300 and 600 K.

Abstract: Possible reasons that confinement resonances are not observed in a recent\nphotoionization experiment on the endohedral fullerene Ce@C82+ are explored.\nThe effect of the polarization of the fullerene shell in response to the\nionization of the endohedrally encaged atom A@Cn, termed the \"shielding\"\neffect, has been investigated and found to be relatively small; no more than a\n20% effect near threshold, and much less at higher energies. It is argued that\nmost likely, the absence of confinement resonances in Ce@C82+ is due primarily\nto the finite thickness of the carbon cage; the off-the-center position and\nthermal vibration of the encaged atom, discussed elsewhere, further weaken the\nresonances rendering them beyond the sensitivity of the experiment to detect,\nin this case.

For the extended set of MSTW PDFs, their\nuncertainties can be obtained using 23, rather than the usual 20, orthogonal\n`uncertainty' eigenvectors.

Rydberg gases are made up of\nrandomly distributed, highly polarizable atoms that interact via strong dipolar\nforces. Dynamics in such a system is fundamentally different from cases in\nwhich the interactions are of short range, and is ultimately determined by the\nspectral and eigenvector structure. In the energy levels' spacing statistics,\nwe find evidence for a critical energy that separates delocalized eigenstates\nfrom states that are localized at pairs or clusters of atoms separated by less\nthan the typical nearest-neighbor distance. We argue that the dipole blockade\neffect in Rydberg gases can be leveraged to manipulate this transition across a\nwide range: As the blockade radius increases, the relative weight of localized\nstates is reduced.

A time-dependent rate equation, implemented in\nthe detailed level accounting approximation, is utilized to study the dynamical\nevolution of the level population and emission properties of the highly\ntransient plasmas.

For the\noptimal control, which requires running multiple propagations to determine the\noptimal pulse sequence, we used the computationally inexpensive time-dependent\nconfiguration interaction singles (TDCIS) method. TDCIS captures all of the\nnecessary correlation of the desired processes but assumes that ionization\npathways reached via double excitations are not present. MCTDHF includes these\npathways and all multiparticle correlations in a set of time-dependent\norbitals. The mechanism that was determined to be optimal in the Raman\nexcitation of the Ne $1s^22s^22p^53p^1$ valence state via the metastable\n$1s^22s^12p^63p^1$ resonance state involves a sequential resonance-valence\nexcitation. First, a long pump pulse excites the core-hole state, and then a\nshorter Stokes pulse transfers the population to the valence state. This\nprocess represents the first step in a multidimensional x-ray spectroscopy\nscheme that will provide a local probe of valence electronic correlations.\nAlthough at the optimal pulse intensities at the TDCIS level of theory the\nMCTDHF method predicts multiple ionization of the atom, at slightly lower\nintensities (reduced by a factor of about 4) the TDCIS mechanism is shown to\nhold qualitatively. Quantitatively, the MCTDHF populations are reduced from the\nTDCIS calculations by a factor of 4. \n\n"}

A fundamental limit in nearly all applications based\non such systems arises from spontaneous emission, in which photons are absorbed\nby atoms and then re-scattered into undesired channels. In typical treatments\nof atomic ensembles, it is assumed that this re-scattering occurs\nindependently, and at a rate given by a single isolated atom, which in turn\ngives rise to standard limits of fidelity in applications such as quantum\nmemories or quantum gates. However, this assumption can be violated. In\nparticular, spontaneous emission of a collective atomic excitation can be\nsignificantly suppressed through strong interference in emission. Thus far the\nphysics underlying the phenomenon of subradiance and techniques to exploit it\nhave not been well-understood. In this work, we provide a comprehensive\ntreatment of this problem. First, we show that in ordered atomic arrays in free\nspace, subradiant states acquire an interpretation in terms of optical modes\nthat are guided by the array, which only emit due to scattering from the ends\nof the finite chain. We also elucidate the properties of subradiant states in\nthe many-excitation limit. Finally, we introduce the new concept of selective\nradiance. Whereas subradiant states experience a reduced coupling to all\noptical modes, selectively radiant states are tailored to simultaneously\nradiate efficiently into a desired channel while scattering into undesired\nchannels is suppressed, thus enabling an enhanced atom-light interface. We show\nthat these states naturally appear in chains of atoms coupled to nanophotonic\nstructures, and we analyze the performance of photon storage exploiting such\nstates. We find that selectively radiant states allow for a photon storage\nerror that scales exponentially better with number of atoms than previously\nknown bounds. \n\n"}

We explore this question by studying the dynamics\nof the momentum distribution function in a dipolar quantum Newton's cradle\nconsisting of highly magnetic dysprosium atoms. This is accomplished by\ncreating the first one-dimensional Bose gas with strong magnetic dipole-dipole\ninteractions. These interactions provide tunability of both the strength of the\nintegrability-breaking perturbation and the nature of the near-integrable\ndynamics. We provide the first experimental evidence that thermalization close\nto a strongly interacting integrable point occurs in two steps:\nprethermalization followed by near-exponential thermalization. Exact numerical\ncalculations on a two-rung lattice model yield a similar two-timescale process,\nsuggesting that this is generic in strongly interacting near-integrable models.\nMoreover, the measured thermalization rate is consistent with a parameter-free\ntheoretical estimate, based on identifying the types of collisions that\ndominate thermalization.

As it is known, in this scenario, the gravitational interaction is\namplified in short distances.

In this work, we investigate how a precision measurement of\nthe electron magnetic moment places meaningful constraints on both chameleons\nand symmetrons. Two effects are identified: First, virtual chameleons and\nsymmetrons run in loops to generate quantum corrections to the intrinsic value\nof the magnetic moment; a common process widely considered in the literature\nfor many scenarios beyond the Standard Model. A second effect, however, is\nunique to scalar fields that exhibit screening. A scalar bubblelike profile\nforms inside the experimental vacuum chamber and exerts a fifth force on the\nelectron, leading to a systematic shift in the experimental measurement. In\nquantifying this latter effect, we present a novel approach that combines\nanalytic arguments and a small number of numerical simulations to solve for the\nbubblelike profile quickly for a large range of model parameters. Taken\ntogether, both effects yield interesting constraints in complementary regions\nof parameter space. While the constraints we obtain for the chameleon are\nlargely uncompetitive with those in the existing literature, this still\nrepresents the tightest constraint achievable yet from an experiment not\noriginally designed to search for fifth forces. We break more ground with the\nsymmetron, for which our results exclude a large and previously unexplored\nregion of parameter space. Central to this achievement are the quantum\ncorrection terms, which are able to constrain symmetrons with masses in the\nrange $\\mu \\in [10^{-3.88},10^8]\\,\\text{eV}$, whereas other experiments have\nhitherto only been sensitive to 1 or 2 orders of magnitude at a time. \n\n"}

We show that, in spite of the fact that the physics\nunderlying the appearance of a chiral response is very different in all these\nmethods, the enantio-sensitive and dichroic observable in all cases has a\nunique form. It is a polar vector given by the product of (i) a molecular\npseudoscalar and (ii) a field pseudovector specified by the configuration of\nthe electric fields interacting with the isotropic ensemble of chiral\nmolecules. The molecular pseudoscalar is a rotationally invariant property,\nwhich is composed from different molecule-specific vectors and in the simplest\ncase is a triple product of such vectors. The key property that enables the\nchiral response is the non-coplanarity of the vectors forming such triple\nproduct. The key property that enables chiral detection without relying on the\nchirality of the electromagnetic fields is the vectorial nature of the\nenantio-sensitive observable. Our compact and general expression for this\nobservable shows what ultimately determines the efficiency of the chiral signal\nand if, or when, it can reach 100%.

{"id": "1810.01889", "contents": "Title: Coherent relaxion dark matter Abstract: We show that relaxion, that addresses the hierarchy problem, can account for\nthe observed dark matter (DM) relic density. The setup is similar to the case\nof axion DM models topped with a dynamical misalignment mechanism. After the\nreheating, when the temperature is well above the electroweak scale, the\nbackreaction potential disappears and the relaxion is displaced from its\nvacuum. When the \"wiggles\" reappear the relaxion coherently oscillates around\nits minimum as in the case of vanilla axion DM models. We identify the\nparameter space such that the relaxion is retrapped leading to the standard\ncosmology. When the relaxion is lighter than $10^{-7}\\,$eV, Hubble friction\nduring radiation-domination is sufficiently strong for retrapping, and even\nminimal models are found to be viable.

Here we extend that work by including new quasar spectra of damped\nLyman-alpha absorption systems. We also re-analyse our previous lower redshift\ndata and confirm our initial results. The constraints on alpha come from\nsimultaneous fitting of absorption lines of subsets of the following species:\nMg I, Mg II, Al II, Al III, Si II, Cr II, Fe II, Ni II and Zn II. We present a\ndetailed description of our methods and results based on an analysis of 49\nquasar absorption systems (towards 28 QSOs) covering the redshift range 0.5 < z\n< 3.5. There is statistical evidence for a smaller alpha at earlier epochs:\nda/a = (-0.72 +/- 0.18) * 10^{-5}. The new and original samples are independent\nbut separately yield consistent and significant non-zero values of da/a. We\nsummarise the results of a thorough investigation of systematic effects\npublished in a companion paper. The value we quote above is the raw value, not\ncorrected for any of these systematic effects. The only significant systematic\neffects so far identified, if removed from our data, would lead to a more\nsignificant deviation of da/a from zero. \n\n"}
