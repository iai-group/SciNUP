We construct an analytic formulation of the combined\neffects of pre-enrichment and self-enrichment and use Monte Carlo models to\nverify that the model accurately encapsulates the mean metallicity and\nmetallicity spread among real GCs. The predicted metallicity spread due to\nself-enrichment alone, a robust prediction of the model, is much smaller than\nthe observed spread among real GCs. This result rules out self-enrichment as a\nsignificant contributor to the metal content in most GCs, leaving\npre-enrichment as the viable alternative. Self-enrichment can, however, be\nimportant for clusters with masses well above 10^6 Msun, which are massive\nenough to hold in a significant fraction of their SN ejecta even without any\nexternal pressure confinement. This transition point corresponds well to the\nmass at which a mass-metallicity relationship (\"blue tilt\") appears in the\nmetal-poor cluster sequence in many large galaxies. We therefore suggest that\nself-enrichment is the primary driver for the mass-metallicity relation. Other\npredictions from our model are that the cluster-to-cluster metallicity spread\ndecreases amongst the highest mass clusters; and that the red GC sequence\nshould also display a more modest mass-metallicity trend if it can be traced to\nsimilarly high mass. \n\n"}

Although the available\nmass for accretion increases with radial distance (a) for disk solid surface\ndensity (sigma) functions sigma=sigma_0*a^(-alpha) with alpha < 2, the\naccretion timescale is significantly longer at larger radial distances.\nEfficient accretion is limited to the first ~ 1E5 years of planetary evolution,\nwhen the planet is extended and before gap opening and type II migration take\nplace. The accreted mass is calculated for disk masses of 0.01, 0.05 and 0.1\nM_sun with alpha = 1/2, 1, and 3/2. We show that a Jupiter-mass protoplanet can\naccrete 1 to 110 M_earth of heavy elements, depending on the disk properties.\nOur results explain the large variation in heavy element enrichment found in\nextra-solar giant planets. Since higher disk surface density is found to lead\nto larger heavy element enrichment, our model results are consistent with the\ncorrelation between heavy element enrichment and stellar metallicity.

The radial variation of the third harmonic terms are well\ndescribed by a logarithmic spiral, from which we interpret that the\ngravitational potential is weakly perturbed by a two-arm spiral density wave\nwith inferred pitch angle of of 52+/-4 degrees. This interpretation predicts a\ntwo-arm spiral distortion in the surface brightness, as hinted by the dust\nstructures in central images of NGC1097, and predicts a combined one-arm and\nthree-arm spiral structure in the velocity field, as revealed in the\nnon-circular motions of the ionised gas within the circumnuclear region of this\ngalaxy. Next, we use a simple spiral perturbation model to constrain the\nfraction of the measured non-circular motions that is due to radial inflow. We\ncombine the resulting inflow velocity with the gas density in the spiral arms,\ninferred from emission line ratios, to estimate the mass inflow rate as a\nfunction of radius, which reaches about 0.011 Msun/yr at a distance of 70 pc\nfrom the center.

We exemplify this\nframework by considering Newtonian-accurate waveforms, which in the\npost-circular scheme give rise to higher harmonics of the orbital phase and\namplitude corrections both to the amplitude and the phase of the Fourier domain\nwaveform.

Viscous evolution of the\nouter circumbinary disk initially hardens the binary, while the inner disk\ndrains onto the primary (central) black hole. As long as the inner disk remains\ncool and thin at low $\\dot{M}_{\\rm ext}$ (rather than becoming hot and\ngeometrically thick), the mass of the inner disk reaches an asymptotic mass\ntypically $\\sim 10^{-3}-10^{-4}\\Msun$. Once the semimajor axis shrinks below a\ncritical value, angular momentum losses from gravitational waves dominate over\nviscous transport in hardening the binary. The inner disk then no longer\nresponds viscously to the inspiraling black holes. Instead, tidal interactions\nwith the secondary rapidly drive the inner disk into the primary. Tidal and\nviscous dissipation in the inner disk lead to a late time brightening in\nluminosity $L\\propto t_{\\rm minus}^{5/4}$, where $t_{\\rm minus}$ is the time\nprior to the final merger.

While the former has been widely\nexplored, the effects of eta-quenching in the magnetic field evolution have\nrarely been considered. In this work we investigate the role of the suppression\nof diffusivity in a flux-transport solar dynamo model that also includes a\nnon-linear alpha-quenching term. Our results indicate that, although for\nalpha-quenching the dependence of the magnetic field amplification with the\nquenching factor is nearly linear, the magnetic field response to eta-quenching\nis non-linear and spatially non-uniform. We have found that the magnetic field\ncan be locally amplified in this case, forming long-lived structures whose\nmaximum amplitude can be up to ~2.5 times larger at the tachocline and up to ~2\ntimes larger at the center of the convection zone than in models without\nquenching. However, this amplification leads to unobservable effects and to a\nworse distribution of the magnetic field in the butterfly diagram. Since the\ndynamo cycle period increases when the efficiency of the quenching increases,\nwe have also explored whether the eta-quenching can cause a diffusion-dominated\nmodel to drift into an advection-dominated regime.

We\nuse a large Monte Carlo library of SFHs to study as a function of galaxy\nspectral type and signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) the statistical uncertainties of\nM/L values using either absorption-line data or broad band colors. The accuracy\nof M/L estimates can be significantly improved by using metal-sensitive indices\nin combination with age-sensitive indices, in particular for galaxies with\nintermediate-age or young stellar populations.

Both subpopulations are\nkinematically distinct and do not show a smooth transition. It is not possible\nto find a common dark halo which reproduces simultaneously the properties of\nboth subpopulations.

The\nevolution of the observed stellar scaling relations is weaker than that of the\nvirial scaling relations of dark matter haloes, which can be reproduced, both\nqualitatively and quantitatively, with a simple, cosmologically-motivated model\nfor disk evolution inside growing NFW dark matter haloes. In this model optical\nhalf-light radii are smaller, both at fixed stellar mass and maximum circular\nvelocity, at higher redshifts. This model also predicts that the scaling\nrelations between baryonic quantities evolve even more weakly than the\ncorresponding stellar relations. We emphasize, though, that this weak evolution\ndoes not imply that individual galaxies evolve weakly.

A relativistic jet is capable of accelerating lower-energy heavy\nseed cosmic rays (CRs) to UHECRs on timescales comparable to the time it takes\nthe jet to pierce the large gaseous cloud.

We\nmeasure the \"excess\" X-ray luminosity of RIQs and RLQs relative to radio-quiet\nquasars (RQQs) as a function of radio loudness and luminosity, and parameterize\nthe X-ray luminosity of RIQs and RLQs both as a function of optical/UV\nluminosity and also as a joint function of optical/UV and radio luminosity.\nRIQs are only modestly X-ray bright relative to RQQs; it is only at high values\nof radio-loudness (R*>3.5) and radio luminosity that RLQs become strongly X-ray\nbright.

We exploited the spectral archive of the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey (SDSS) to create a sample of more than 9000 quasars in the\nStripe 82. The quasar catalogue was matched with the Light Motion Curve\nCatalogue for SDSS Stripe 82 and individual first-order structure functions\nwere computed. The structure functions are used to create a variability\nindicator that is related to the same intrinsic timescales for all quasars (1\nto 2 yr in the rest frame). We study the variability ratios for adjacent SDSS\nfilter bands as a function of redshift. While variability is almost always\nstronger in the bluer passband compared to the redder, the variability ratio\ndepends on whether strong emission lines contribute to either one band or the\nother. The variability ratio-redshift relations resemble the corresponding\ncolour index-redshift relations. From the comparison with Monte Carlo\nsimulations of variable quasar spectra we find that the observed variability\nratio-redshift relations are closely fitted assuming that (a) the r.m.s.\nfluctuation of the quasar continuum follows a power law-dependence on the\nintrinsic wavelength with an exponent -2 (i.e., bluer when brighter) and (b)\nthe variability of the emission line flux is only about 10% of that of the\nunderlying continuum. These results, based upon the photometry of more than\n8000 quasars, confirm the previous findings by Wilhite et al. (2005) from 315\nquasars with repeated SDSS spectroscopy. Finally, we find that quasars with\nunusual spectra and weak emission lines tend to have less variability than\nconventional quasars. This trend is opposite to what is expected from the\ndilution effect of variability due to line emission and may be indicative of\nhigh Eddington ratios in these unconventinal quasars. \n\n"}

Abstract: We test and present the application of the full rescaling method by Angulo &\nWhite (2010) to change the cosmology of halo catalogues in numerical\nsimulations for cosmological parameter search using semi-analytic galaxy\nproperties. We show that a reduced form of the method can be applied in small\nsimulations with box side of ~50/h Mpc. We perform statistical tests on the\naccuracy of the properties of rescaled individual haloes, and also on the\nrescaled population as a whole.

The dispersion in\nthe recovered halo mass does not seem to depend on the resolution of the\nsimulation.

AGN pairs experience stronger BH accretion, as measured by their [O\nIII]5007 luminosities (corrected for contribution from star formation) and\nEddington ratios, than do control samples of single AGNs matched in redshift\nand host stellar mass. Their host galaxies have stronger post-starburst\nactivity and younger mean stellar ages, as indicated by stronger H-delta\nabsorption and smaller 4000 A break in their spectra. The BH accretion and\nrecent star formation in the host galaxies both increase with decreasing\nprojected separation in AGN pairs, for r_p ~< 10-30 kpc. The intensity of BH\naccretion, the post-starburst strength, and the mean stellar ages are\ncorrelated between the two AGNs in a pair.

The main goal is to\ninvestigate possible mechanisms to explain the observed dichotomy in radial\nstellar metallicity profiles of dwarf galaxies: dwarf irregulars (dIrr) and\nflat, rotating dwarf ellipticals (dE) generally possess flat metallicity\nprofiles, while rounder and non-rotating dEs show strong negative metallicity\ngradients. These simulations show that flattening by rotation is key to\nreproducing the observed characteristics of flat dwarf galaxies, proving\nparticularly efficient in erasing metallicity gradients. We propose a\n\"centrifugal barrier mechanism\" as an alternative to the previously suggested\n\"fountain mechanism\" for explaining the flat metallicity profiles of dIrrs and\nflat, rotating dEs. While only flattening the dark-matter halo has little\ninfluence, the addition of angular momentum slows down the infall of gas, so\nthat star formation (SF) and the ensuing feedback are less centrally\nconcentrated, occurring galaxy-wide. Additionally, this leads to more\ncontinuous SFHs by preventing large-scale oscillations in the SFR\n(\"breathing\"), and creates low density holes in the ISM, in agreement with\nobservations of dIrrs.

The\nexistence and structure of the NSSL cannot be attributed to the conservation of\nangular momentum by solar surface convection, as is often supposed.

We designate this region as the star forming (SF) disk, in which metals\nare produced from supernova explosions (SNexp) while at the same time inflows\nare driven by SNexp-excited turbulent viscosity to accrete onto the SMBHs. In\nthis paper, an equation of metallicity governed by SNexp and radial advection\nis established to describe the metal distribution and evolution in the SF disk.\nWe find that the metal abundance is enriched at different rates at different\npositions in the disk, and that a metallicity gradient is set up that evolves\nfor steady-state AGNs. Metallicity as an integrated physical parameter can be\nused as a probe of the SF disk age during one episode of SMBH activity.

The sample consists of 17 early-type galaxies (ETG) selected\nfrom the SLACS gravitational-lens survey. The galaxies cover the redshift range\nfrom 0.08 to 0.35 and have stellar velocity dispersions between 200 and 350\nkm/s.

Abstract: Lyman Alpha Emitters (LAEs) are galaxies that have been selected on the basis\nof a strong Ly{\\alpha} emission line in their spectra. Observational campaigns\nhave dramatically increased the sample of known LAEs, which now extends out to\nz=7. These discoveries have motivated numerous theoretical studies on the\nsubject, which usually define LAEs in their models based on sharp Ly{\\alpha}\nluminosity and equivalent width (EW) cuts. While broadly representative, this\nprocedure does not mimic the selection from observational programs in detail,\nwhich instead use cuts in various colour-spaces. We investigate what\nimplications this disjoint may have for studies that aim to model LAEs. We\nconstruct an empirical model for the number density of star forming galaxies as\na function of their UV and Ly{\\alpha} luminosity, utilising measured\nconstraints on the luminosity functions (LFs) of drop-out galaxies, and their\nluminosity dependent probability distribution function of Ly{\\alpha} EW. In\nparticular, we investigate whether the LAE LFs can be reproduced by defining\nLAEs using a (z-dependent) Ly{\\alpha} luminosity and EW threshold. While we are\nable to reproduce the observed distribution of Ly{\\alpha} EW among LAEs out to\nrestframe EW 200 A, we find that our formalism over-predicts both the UV and\nLy{\\alpha} LFs of LAEs by a factor of 2-3, and is inconsistent with\nobservations at the ~95% level. This tension is partially resolved if we assume\nthe Ly{\\alpha} EW-distribution of drop-out galaxies to be truncated at\nrestframe EW>150 A. However the overprediction indicates that modeling LAEs\nwith simple REW and luminosity cuts does not accurately mimic observed\nselection criteria, and can lead to uncertainties in the predicted number\ndensity of LAEs. On the other hand, the predicted z-evolution is not affected.\nWe apply our formalism to drop-out galaxies at z>6, and predict the LFs of LAEs\nat z=7-9. \n\n"}

In the minimal\nLambdaCDM model, such sterile neutrinos are strongly disfavoured by current\ndata because they contribute too much hot dark matter. However, if the\ncosmological framework is extended to include also additional relativistic\ndegrees of freedom -- beyond the three standard neutrinos and the putative\nsterile neutrinos, then the hot dark matter constraint on the sterile states is\nconsiderably relaxed. A further improvement is achieved by allowing a dark\nenergy equation of state parameter w<-1. While BBN strongly disfavours extra\nradiation beyond the assumed eV-mass sterile neutrino, this constraint can be\ncircumvented by a small nu_e degeneracy. Any model containing eV-mass sterile\nneutrinos implies also strong modifications of other cosmological parameters.\nNotably, the inferred cold dark matter density can shift up by 20 to 75%\nrelative to the standard LambdaCDM value. \n\n"}

Early decays add an\nadditional radiation component to both the CMB and BBN, while late decays can\nalter the radiation content seen in the CMB while having a negligible effect on\nBBN.

Font et\nal. have recently demonstrated that these simulations are able to successfully\nreproduce the satellite luminosity functions and the metallicity and surface\nbrightness profiles of the spheroids of the Milky Way and M31. A key to the\nsuccess of the simulations is a significant contribution to the spheroid from\nstars that formed in situ. While the outer halo is dominated by accreted stars,\nstars formed in the main progenitor of the galaxy dominate at r < ~30 kpc. In\nthe present study we show that this component was primarily formed in a\nproto-disc at high redshift and was subsequently liberated from the disc by\ndynamical heating associated with mass accretion. As a consequence of its\norigin, the in situ component of the spheroid has different kinematics (namely\nnet prograde rotation with respect to the disc) than that of the spheroid\ncomponent built from the disruption of satellites. In addition, the in situ\ncomponent has a flattened distribution, that is due in part to its rotation.

We observe a highly significant and tight (~0.7 dex)\ncorrelation between excess variance and MBH. The subsample of reverberation\nmapped AGN shows an even smaller scatter (~0.45 dex) comparable to the one\ninduced by the MBH uncertainties. This implies that X-ray variability can be\nused as an accurate tool to measure MBH and this method is more accurate than\nthe ones based on single epoch optical spectra. The excess variance vs.\naccretion rate dependence is weaker than expected based on the PSD break\nfrequency scaling, suggesting that both the PSD high frequency break and the\nnormalisation depend on accretion rate in such a way that they almost\ncompletely counterbalance each other. A highly significant correlation between\nexcess variance and 2-10 keV spectral index is observed.

Our study is aimed at developing independent constraints on\nthese models. In such models, DDM decays into a less massive, stable dark\nmatter (SDM) particle and a significantly lighter particle. The small mass\nsplitting between the parent DDM and the daughter SDM provides the SDM with a\nrecoil or \"kick\" velocity vk, inducing a free-streaming suppression of matter\nfluctuations. This suppression may be probed via weak lensing power spectra\nmeasured by a number of forthcoming imaging surveys that aim primarily to\nconstrain dark energy.

When the\nhierarchy is large, a low energy effective field theory (EFT) exists in which\nonly curvature modes participate in the dynamics of perturbations. In this EFT\nheavy fields continue to have a significant role in the low energy dynamics, as\ntheir interaction with curvature modes reduces their speed of sound whenever\nthe multi-field trajectory is subject to a sharp turn in target space. Here we\nanalyze under which general conditions this EFT remains a reliable description\nfor the linear evolution of curvature modes. We find that the main condition\nconsists on demanding that the rate of change of the turn's angular velocity\nstays suppressed with respect to the masses of heavy modes. This adiabaticity\ncondition allows the EFT to accurately describe a large variety of situations\nin which the multi-field trajectory is subject to sharp turns. To test this, we\nanalyze several models with turns and show that, indeed, the power spectra\nobtained for both the original two-field theory and its single-field EFT are\nidentical when the adiabaticity condition is satisfied. In particular, when\nturns are sharp and sudden, they are found to generate large features in the\npower spectrum, accurately reproduced by the EFT. \n\n"}

We focus\non the possibility that the coupling between the in-streaming gas and the disc\nis maximal, e.g., via dense clumps, and ask whether the streams could be the\ndriver of turbulence in an unstable disc with a Toomre parameter Q~1. Our\nfiducial model assumes an efficiency of ~0.5 per dynamical time for the decay\nof turbulence energy, and ~0.02 for each of the processes that deplete the disc\ngas, i.e., star formation, outflow, and inflow within the disc into a central\nbulge. In this case, the in-streaming drives a ratio of turbulent to rotation\nvelocity sigma/V~0.2-0.3, which at z~2 induces an instability with Q~1, both as\nobserved. However, in conflict with observations, this model predicts that\nsigma/V remains constant with time, independent of the cosmological accretion\nrate, because mass and turbulence have the same external source. Such strongly\ncoupled cosmological inflow tends to stabilize the disc at low z, with Q ~ a\nfew, which may be consistent with observations. The instability could instead\nbe maintained for longer, with a properly declining sigma/V, if it is\nself-regulated to oscillations about Q~1 by a duty cycle for disc depletion.\nHowever, the 'off' phases of this duty cycle become long at low z, which may be\nhard to reconcile with observations. Alternatively, the coupling between the\nin-streaming gas and the disc may weaken in time, reflecting an evolving nature\nof the accretion. If, instead, that coupling is weak at all times, the likely\nenergy source for self-regulated stirring up of the turbulence is the inflow\nwithin the disc down the potential gradient (studied in a companion paper). \n\n"}

Results Abstract: The spectral absorption lines in early-type galaxies contain a wealth of\ninformation regarding the detailed abundance pattern, star formation history,\nand stellar initial mass function (IMF) of the underlying stellar population.\nUsing our new population synthesis model that accounts for the effect of\nvariable abundance ratios of 11 elements, we analyze very high quality\nabsorption line spectra of 38 early-type galaxies and the nuclear bulge of M31.\nThese data extend to 1um and they therefore include the IMF-sensitive spectral\nfeatures NaI, CaII, and FeH at 0.82um, 0.86um and 0.99um, respectively. The\nmodels fit the data well, with typical rms residuals ~1%. Strong constraints on\nthe IMF and therefore the stellar mass-to-light ratio, (M/L)_stars, are derived\nfor individual galaxies. We find that the IMF becomes increasingly bottom-heavy\nwith increasing velocity dispersion and [Mg/Fe]. At the lowest dispersions and\n[Mg/Fe] values the derived IMF is consistent with the Milky Way IMF, while at\nthe highest dispersions and [Mg/Fe] values the derived IMF contains more\nlow-mass stars (is more bottom-heavy) than even a Salpeter IMF. Our best-fit\n(M/L)_stars values do not exceed dynamically-based M/L values. We also apply\nour models to stacked spectra of four metal-rich globular clusters in M31 and\nfind an (M/L)_stars that implies fewer low-mass stars than a Milky Way IMF,\nagain agreeing with dynamical constraints.

These high resolution (1 pc) simulations follow formation and\ndestruction of individual GMCs and star clusters. The final starburst is\ndominated by in situ star formation, fueled by gas which flows inwards due to\nglobal torques. The resulting high gas density results in rapid star formation.\nThe gas is self gravitating, and forms massive (~10^10 M_sun) GMCs and\nsubsequent super-starclusters (masses up to 10^8 M_sun). However, in contrast\nto some recent simulations, the bulk of new stars which eventually form the\ncentral bulge are not born in superclusters which then sink to the center of\nthe galaxy, because feedback efficiently disperses GMCs after they turn several\npercent of their mass into stars. Most of the mass that reaches the nucleus\ndoes so in the form of gas. The Kennicutt-Schmidt law emerges naturally as a\nconsequence of feedback balancing gravitational collapse, independent of the\nsmall-scale star formation microphysics. The same mechanisms that drive this\nrelation in isolated galaxies, in particular radiation pressure from IR\nphotons, extend over seven decades in SFR to regulate star formation in the\nmost extreme starbursts (densities >10^4 M_sun/pc^2). Feedback also drives\nsuper-winds with large mass loss rates; but a significant fraction of the wind\nmaterial falls back onto the disks at later times, leading to higher\npost-starburst SFRs in the presence of stellar feedback. Strong AGN feedback is\nrequired to explain sharp cutoffs in star formation rate. We compare the\npredicted relic structure, mass profile, morphology, and efficiency of disk\nsurvival to simulations which do not explicitly resolve GMCs or feedback.\nGlobal galaxy properties are similar, but sub-galactic properties and star\nformation rates can differ significantly. \n\n"}

To take full advantage of this unprecedented\nstatistical power, the systematic errors associated with weak lensing\nmeasurements need to be controlled to a level similar to the statistical\nerrors.\n  This work is the first attempt to quantitatively estimate the absolute level\nand statistical properties of the systematic errors on weak lensing shear\nmeasurements due to the most important physical effects in the LSST system via\nhigh fidelity ray-tracing simulations.

The mocks that we\nconstruct are lightcone catalogues, in which a galaxy is placed according to\nthe epoch at which it first enters the past lightcone of the observer, and\nincorporate the evolution of galaxy properties with cosmic time.

As an application, we consider the\neffectiveness of the BzK colour selection technique, which was designed to\nisolate galaxies in the redshift interval 1.4<z<2.5. The mock catalogue is in\nreasonable agreement with the observed number counts of all BzK galaxies, as\nwell as with the observed counts of the subsample of BzKs that are star-forming\ngalaxies. We predict that over 75 per cent of the model galaxies with\nK_{AB}<=23, and 1.4<z<2.5, are selected by the BzK technique.

Abstract: There is observational evidence for inside-out growth of elliptical galaxies\nsince $z \\gtrsim 2-3$, which is not driven by in-situ star formation. Many\nsystems at high redshift have small sizes $\\sim 1kpc$ and surface brightness\nprofiles with low Sersic indices n. The most likely descendants have, on\naverage, grown by a factor of two in mass and a factor of four in size,\nindicating $r \\propto M^{\\alpha}$ with $\\alpha \\gtrsim 2$. They also have\nsurface brightness profiles with $n \\gtrsim 5$. This evolution can be\nqualitatively explained on the basis of two assumptions: compact ellipticals\npredominantly grow by collisionless minor or intermediate 'dry' mergers, and\nthey are embedded in massive dark matter halos. We draw these conclusions from\nidealized collisionless mergers spheroidal galaxies - with and without dark\nmatter - with mass ratios of 1:1, 1:5, and 1:10. The sizes evolve as $r \\propto\nM^{\\alpha}$ with $\\alpha < 2$ for mass-ratios of 1:1. For minor mergers of\ngalaxies embedded in dark matter halos, the sizes grow significantly faster and\nthe profile shapes change more rapidly. Mergers with moderate mass-ratios of\n1:5 give $\\alpha \\sim 2.3$ and a final Sersic index of $n = 9.5$ after doubling\nthe stellar mass. This is accompanied by a significant increase of the dark\nmatter fraction within the stellar half-mass radius, driven by the strong size\nincrease probing larger, dark matter dominated regions. Only a few intermediate\nmass-ratio mergers of galaxies embedded in massive dark matter halos can result\nin the observed concurrent inside-out growth and the rapid evolution in profile\nshapes.

Hence, the Bondi accretion cannot be used in\nthese cases, such as in the galaxy NGC 3115. The winds of these high-velocity\nstars are shocked to temperatures above the virial temperature of the galaxy,\nleading to the formation of a hot bubble of size ~0.1-10 pc near the center.\nThis hot bubble can substantially reduce the mass accretion rate by the SMBH.\nIf the density of the hot bubble is lower than that of the interstellar medium\n(ISM), a density-inversion layer is formed.

I: Escape of Ionizing\n  Photons Abstract: We describe a new method for simulating ionizing radiation and supernova\nfeedback in the analogues of low-redshift galactic disks. In this method, which\nwe call star-forming molecular cloud (SFMC) particles, we use a ray-tracing\ntechnique to solve the radiative transfer equation for ultraviolet photons\nemitted by thousands of distinct particles on the fly. Joined with high\nnumerical resolution of 3.8 pc, the realistic description of stellar feedback\nhelps to self-regulate star formation. This new feedback scheme also enables us\nto study the escape of ionizing photons from star-forming clumps and from a\ngalaxy, and to examine the evolving environment of star-forming gas clumps. By\nsimulating a galactic disk in a halo of 2.3e11 Msun, we find that the average\nescape fraction from all radiating sources on the spiral arms (excluding the\ncentral 2.5 kpc) fluctuates between 0.08% and 5.9% during a ~20 Myr period with\na mean value of 1.1%. The flux of escaped photons from these sources is not\nstrongly beamed, but manifests a large opening angle of more than 60 degree\nfrom the galactic pole. Further, we investigate the escape fraction per SFMC\nparticle, f_esc(i), and how it evolves as the particle ages. We discover that\nthe average escape fraction f_esc is dominated by a small number of SFMC\nparticles with high f_esc(i). On average, the escape fraction from a SFMC\nparticle rises from 0.27% at its birth to 2.1% at the end of a particle\nlifetime, 6 Myrs. This is because SFMC particles drift away from the dense gas\nclumps in which they were born, and because the gas around the star-forming\nclumps is dispersed by ionizing radiation and supernova feedback. The framework\nestablished in this study brings deeper insight into the physics of photon\nescape fraction from an individual star-forming clump, and from a galactic\ndisk. \n\n"}

Although modern simulations of galaxy formation can resolve scales of\n10-100 pc, star formation and feedback operate on smaller, \"subgrid\" scales.\nGreat care should therefore be taken in order to properly account for the\neffect of feedback on global galaxy evolution. We investigate the momentum and\nenergy budget of feedback during different stages of stellar evolution, and\nstudy its impact on the interstellar medium using simulations of local star\nforming regions and galactic disks at the resolution affordable in modern\ncosmological zoom-in simulations. In particular, we present a novel subgrid\nmodel for the momentum injection due to radiation pressure and stellar winds\nfrom massive stars during early, pre-supernova evolutionary stages of young\nstar clusters. Early injection of momentum acts to clear out dense gas in star\nforming regions, hence limiting star formation. The reduced gas density\nmitigates radiative losses of thermal feedback energy from subsequent supernova\nexplosions, leading to an increased overall efficiency of stellar feedback. The\ndetailed impact of stellar feedback depends sensitively on the implementation\nand choice of parameters. Somewhat encouragingly, we find that implementations\nin which feedback is efficient lead to approximate self-regulation of global\nstar formation efficiency. We compare simulation results using our feedback\nimplementation to other phenomenological feedback methods, where thermal\nfeedback energy is allowed to dissipate over time scales longer than the formal\ngas cooling time.

Together, this gives us the opportunity to assess the\ncontribution of galaxies to reionisation self-consistently. The strong mass and\nredshift dependence of the escape fraction indicates that reionisation occurred\nbetween z=15 and z=10 and was mainly driven by proto-galaxies forming in\ndark-matter haloes with masses between 1e7 and 1e8 solar mass.

To investigate the extent to which satellite and central\ngalaxy evolution differs, we separately model the stellar mass - halo mass (M*\n-Mh) relation for these two populations over the redshift interval 0 < z < 1.\nThis relation for central galaxies is constrained by the galaxy stellar mass\nfunction while the relation for satellite galaxies is constrained against\nrecent measurements of the galaxy two-point correlation function (2PCF). At z ~\n0 the satellites, on average, have ~10% larger stellar masses at fixed peak\nsubhalo mass compared to central galaxies of the same halo mass.

We find that the mass loss is\nexpected to occur through a steady wind over many tens of free-fall times (t_ff\n~ 10 Myr) rather than by an explosive disruption in one or a few t_ff. Our\nanalysis is based on the finding from simulations that radiation trapping is\nnegligible because it destabilizes the wind (Krumholz & Thompson 2012, 2013).\nEach photon can therefore contribute to the wind momentum only once, so the\nradiative force is limited to L/c. When combining radiation, protostellar and\nmain-sequence winds, and supernovae, we estimate the total direct injection\nrate of momentum into the outflow to be 2.5 L/c. The adiabatic phase of\nsupernovae and main-sequence winds can double this rate. The resulting outflow\nmass-loading factor is of order unity, and if the clumps were to deplete their\ngas the timescale would have been a few disk orbital times, to end with half\nthe original clump mass in stars. However, the clump migration time to the disk\ncenter is on the order of an orbital time, about 250 Myr, so the clumps are\nexpected to complete their migration prior to depletion. Furthermore, the\nclumps are expected to double their mass in a disk orbital time by accretion\nfrom the disk and clump-clump mergers, so their mass actually grows in time and\nwith decreasing radius. From the 6-7 giant clumps with observed outflows, 5 are\nconsistent with these predictions, and one has a much higher mass-loading\nfactor and momentum injection rate. The latter either indicates that the\nestimated outflow is an overestimate (within the 1-sigma error), that the SFR\nhas dropped since the time when the outflow was launched, or that the driving\nmechanism is different, e.g. supernova feedback in a cavity generated by the\nother feedbacks. \n\n"}

We explore\nthis problem by studying how the MIR covering factor (CF_{MIR}\n=L_{MIR}/L_{bol}) correlates with the fundamental parameters of AGN accretion\nprocess (such as L_{bol}, black hole mass MBH, and Eddington ratio L/LEdd) and\nthe properties of narrow emission lines (as represented by [O III] 5007), using\nlarge data sets derived from the Sloan Digital Sky Spectroscopic Survey (SDSS)\nand the Wide Infrared Sky Survey (WISE). Firstly we find that the luminosity of\nthe [O III] wing component (Lwing) correlates more tightly with the continuum\nluminosity (L5100) than the luminosity of the line core component (Lcore) does,\nwhich is in line with our previous conclusion that the wing component,\ngenerally blueshifted, originates from the polar outflows in the inner\nnarrow-line region (NLR). We then find that the MIR CF shows the strongest\ncorrelation with Lwing/L_{bol} rather than with Lcore/L_{bol} or the above\nfundamental AGN parameters, and the correlation becomes stronger as the\ninfrared wavelength increases. We also confirm the anti-correlations of\nCF_{MIR} with L_{bol} and MBH, and the lack of dependence of CF_{MIR} on the\nEddington ratio.

HFI photometric calibration and mapmaking Abstract: This paper describes the processing applied to the HFI cleaned time-ordered\ndata to produce photometrically calibrated maps. HFI observes the sky over a\nbroad range of frequencies, from 100 to 857 GHz. To get the best accuracy on\nthe calibration on such a large range, two different photometric calibration\nschemes have to be used. The 545 and 857 \\GHz\\ data are calibrated using Uranus\nand Neptune flux density measurements, compared with models of their\natmospheric emissions to calibrate the data. The lower frequencies (below 353\nGHz) are calibrated using the cosmological microwave background dipole.One of\nthe components of this anisotropy results from the orbital motion of the\nsatellite in the Solar System, and is therefore time-variable. Photometric\ncalibration is thus tightly linked to mapmaking, which also addresses low\nfrequency noise removal. The 2013 released HFI data show some evidence for\napparent gain variations of the HFI bolometers' detection chain. These\nvariations were identified by comparing observations taken more than one year\napart in the same configuration. We developed an effective correction to limit\nits effect on calibration, and assess its accuracy. We present several methods\nused to estimate the precision of the photometric calibration.

It will soon become possible to directly link the most accurate\nradio reference frame with the Gaia optical reference frame using many common\nextragalactic objects.

Aims.\nUsing the best catalogues available at present, we investigate how many AGN\nwith significantly large optical-radio positional offsets exist as well as the\npossible causes of these offsets. Methods. We performed a case study by finding\noptical counterparts to the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF2)\nradio sources in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 9 (DR9). The\nICRF2 catalogue was used as a reference because the radio positions determined\nby Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations are about two orders\nof magnitude more accurate than the optical positions. Results. We find 1297\nobjects in common for ICRF2 and SDSS DR9. Statistical analysis of the\noptical-radio differences verifies that the SDSS DR9 positions are accurate to\n~55 mas in both coordinates, with no systematic offset with respect to ICRF2.\nWe find 51 sources (~4% of the sample) for which the positional offset exceeds\n170 mas (~3{\\sigma}).

Spatial\n  distributions and scaling-relations of dust and molecular hydrogen Abstract: We investigate the time evolution of dust properties, molecular hydrogen\n(H_2) contents, and star formation histories in galaxies by using our original\nchemodynamical simulations. The simulations include the formation of dust in\nthe stellar winds of supernovae (SNe) and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars,\nthe growth and destruction processes of dust in the interstellar medium (ISM),\nthe formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) dust in carbon-rich AGB\nstars, the H_2 formation on dust grains, and the H_2 photo-dissociation due to\nfar ultra-violet (FUV) light in a self-consistent manner. We focus mainly on\ndisk galaxies with different total masses in this preliminary study. The\nprinciple results are as follows: The star formation histories of disk galaxies\ncan be regulated by the time evolution of interstellar dust, mainly because the\nformation rates of H_2 can be controlled by dust properties. The observed\ncorrelation between dust-to-gas-ratios (D) and gas-phase oxygen abundances (A_O\n= 12+log(O/H)) can be reproduced reasonably well in the present models. The\ndisks show negative radial gradients (i.e., larger in inner regions) of H_2\nfraction (f_H2), PAH-to-dust mass ratio (f_PAH), D, and A_O and these gradients\nevolve with time. The surface-mass densities of dust (Sigma_dust) are\ncorrelated more strongly with the total surface gas densities than with those\nof H_2. Local gaseous regions with higher D are more likely to have higher f_H2\nin individual disks and total H_2 masses correlate well with total dust masses.\nMore massive disk galaxies are more likely to have higher D, f_PAH, and f_H2\nand smaller dust-to-stellar mass ratios.

A fading of the optical-infrared (IR) flux occurred\nas the source entered the hard-intermediate state, followed by a brightening as\nit returned to the hard state. The optical-IR spectrum was consistent with a\npower law from optically thin synchrotron emission, except when the X-ray\nspectrum was softest. By fitting the radio to optical spectra with a broken\npower law, we constrain the frequency and flux of the optically thick/thin\nbreak in the jet synchrotron spectrum.

Ram pressure\n  dynamics Abstract: We use the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method combined with an\nn-body code to study the dynamics of the interaction between a gas-rich spiral\ngalaxy and intracluster or intragroup medium, often known as the ram pressure\nscenario. The advantage of this gas kinetic approach over traditional\nhydrodynamics is explicit treatment of the interface between the hot and cold,\ndense and rarefied media typical of astrophysical flows and the explicit\nconservation of energy and momentum and the interface. This approach yields\nsome new physical insight. Owing to the shock and backward wave that forms at\nthe point ICM--ISM contact, ICM gas is compressed, heated and slowed. The shock\nmorphology is Mach-disk-like. In the outer galaxy, the hot turbulent post-shock\ngas flows around the galaxy disk, while heating and ablating the initially cool\ndisk gas. The outer gas and angular momentum are lost to the flow. In the inner\ngalaxy, the hot gas pressurizes the neutral ISM gas causing a strong two-phase\ninstability. As a result, the momentum of the wind is no longer impulsively\ncommunicated to the cold gas as assumed in the Gunn-Gott (1972) formula, but\noozes through the porous disk, transferring its linear momentum to the disk en\nmasse. The escaping gas mixture has a net positive angular momentum and forms a\nslowly rotating sheath. The shear flow caused by the post-shock ICM flowing\nthrough the porous multiphase ISM creates a strong Kelvin-Helmholtz instability\nin the disk that results in Cartwheel-like ring and spoke morphology. \n\n"}

This is generally\nderived employing a collisional MHD model. However, in the ICM the ion mean\nfree path between collisions is of the order of the dynamical scales, thus\nrequiring a collisionless MHD description. Unlike collisional MHD simulations,\nour study uses an anisotropic plasma pressure with respect to the direction of\nthe local magnetic field, which brings the plasma within a parameter space\nwhere collisionless instabilities should take place. Within the adopted model\nthese instabilities are contained at bay through the relaxation term of the\npressure anisotropy which simulates the feedback of the mirror and firehose\ninstabilities. This relaxation acts to get the plasma distribution function\nconsistent with the empirical studies of collisionless plasmas. Our 3D\nnumerical simulations of forced transonic turbulence motivated by modeling of\nthe turbulent ICM are performed for different initial values of the magnetic\nfield intensity, and different relaxation rates of the pressure anisotropy. We\nfound that in the high beta plasma regime corresponding to the ICM conditions,\na fast anisotropy relaxation rate gives results which are similar to the\ncollisional-MHD model as far as the statistical properties of the turbulence\nare concerned. Also, the amplification of seed magnetic fields due to the\nturbulent dynamo action is similar to the collisional-MHD model. Our\nsimulations that do not employ the anisotropy relaxation deviate significantly\nfrom the collisional-MHD results, and show more power at the small-scale\nfluctuations of both density and velocity representing the results of the\ninstabilities. For these simulations the large scale fluctuations in the\nmagnetic field are mostly suppressed and the turbulent dynamo fails in\namplifying seed magnetic fields. \n\n"}

However, since galaxy clusters are dynamically\nactive objects whose dynamical states can deviate significantly from the\nequilibrium configuration, the departure from the hydrostatic equilibrium\nassumption is one of the largest sources of systematic uncertainties in cluster\ncosmology. In the literature there has been two methods for computing the\nhydrostatic mass bias based on the Euler and the modified Jeans equations,\nrespectively, and there has been some confusion about the validity of these two\nmethods.

A past Milky Way-Andromeda\n  encounter at z>0.8 Abstract: The Local Group timing has been one of the first historical probes of the\nmissing mass problem. Whilst modern cosmological probes indicate that pure\nbaryonic dynamics is not sufficient on the largest scales, nearby galaxies and\nsmall galaxy groups persistently obey Milgrom's MOND law, which implies that\ndynamics at small scales is possibly entirely predicted by the baryons. Here,\nwe investigate the Local Group timing in this context of Milgromian dynamics.\nMaking use of the latest measured proper motions and radial velocities for\nAndromeda and the Magellanic clouds, we integrate backwards their orbits by\nmaking use of the Milgromian two-body equation of motion. We find that, with\nthe currently measured proper motions and radial velocity of M31, MOND would\nimply that the Milky Way and M31 first moved apart via Hubble expansion after\nbirth, but then necessarily got attracted again by the Milgromian gravitational\nattraction, and had a past fly-by encounter before coming to their present\npositions. This encounter would most probably have happened 7 to 11 Gyr ago\n(0.8<z<3). The absence of a dark matter halo and its associated dynamical\nfriction is necessary for such a close encounter not to trigger a merger.\nObservational arguments which could exclude or favour such a past encounter\nwould thus be very important in view of falsifying or vindicating Milgromian\ndynamics on the scale of the Local Group. Interestingly, the closest approach\nof the encounter is small enough (<55 kpc) to have severe consequences on the\ndisk dynamics, including perhaps thick disk formation, and on the satellite\nsystems of both galaxies. The ages of the satellite galaxies and of the young\nhalo globular clusters, all of which form the vast polar structure around the\nMilky Way, are consistent with these objects having been born in this\nencounter. \n\n"}

The\nPAndAS collaboration has identified a particularly thin configuration with\nkinematic coherence among companions of M31 and there have been long standing\nclaims that the dwarf companions to the Milky Way lie in a plane roughly\northogonal to the disk of our galaxy. This discussion investigates the possible\norigins of four Local Group planes: the plane similar, but not identical to\nthat identified by PAndAS, an adjacent slightly tilted plane, and two planes\nnear the Milky Way: one with nearer galaxies and the other with more distant\nones. Plausible orbits are found by using a combination of Numerical Action\nmethods and a backward in time integration procedure. For M31, M33, IC10, and\nLeoI, solutions are found that are consistent with measurements of their proper\nmotions. For galaxies in planes, there must be commonalities in their proper\nmotions, and this constraint greatly limits the number of physically plausible\nsolutions.

Our star clusters are born at z = 10\n(corresponding to an age of the Universe of about 500 Myr) by selecting a dark\nmatter particle and initializing a star cluster with 32,000 stars on its\nlocation. We then follow the dynamical evolution of the star cluster within the\ncosmological environment.\n  We compare the evolution of star clusters in two Milky-Way size haloes with a\ndifferent accretion history. The mass loss of the star clusters is continuous\nirrespective of the tidal history of the host halo, but major merger events\ntend to increase the rate of mass loss. From the selected two dark matter\nhaloes, the halo that experienced the larger number of mergers tends to drive a\nsmaller mass loss rate from the embedded star clusters, even though the final\nmasses of both haloes are similar. We identify two families of star clusters:\nnative clusters, which become part of the main halo before its final major\nmerger event, and the immigrant clusters, which are accreted upon or after this\nevent; native clusters tend to evaporate more quickly than immigrant clusters.\nAccounting for the evolution of the dark matter halo causes immigrant star\nclusters to retain more mass than when the z=0 tidal field is taken as a static\npotential.

By the z-transformed discrete\ncorrelation function method and the model-independent flux randomization/random\nsubset selection (FR/RSS) Monte Carlo method, we find that the broad Hbeta line\nvariations lead the 15 GHz variations. The FR/RSS method shows that the Hbeta\nline variations lead the radio variations by a factor of tau_{ob}=0.34 +/- 0.01\nyr. This time lag can be used to locate the position of emitting region of\nradio outbursts in jet, on the order of ~ 5 light-years, from the central\nengine.

This technique constitutes an important part of the science case\nfor the forthcoming NICER and proposed LOFT X-ray missions. In this paper, we\ndetermine the number of distinct observables that can be derived from pulse\nprofile modeling and show that using only bolometric pulse profiles is\ninsufficient for breaking the degeneracy between inferred neutron-star radius\nand mass. However, we also show that for moderately spinning (300-800 Hz)\nneutron stars, analysis of pulse profiles in two different energy bands\nprovides additional constraints that allow a unique determination of the\nneutron-star properties. Using the fractional amplitudes of the fundamental and\nthe second harmonic of the pulse profile in addition to the amplitude and phase\ndifference of the spectral color oscillations, we quantify the signal-to-noise\nratio necessary to achieve a specified measurement precision for neutron star\nradius. We find that accumulating 10^6 counts in a pulse profile is sufficient\nto achieve a <5% uncertainty in the neutron star radius, which is the level of\naccuracy required to determine the equation of state of neutron-star matter.\nFinally, we formally derive the background limits that can be tolerated in the\nmeasurements of the various pulsation amplitudes as a function of the system\nparameters. \n\n"}

In many cases, the\ngrowth of bubbles reaches a stationary state, with bubble walls propagating as\ndetonations or deflagrations. However, these hydrodynamical solutions may be\nunstable under corrugation of the interface. Such instability may drastically\nalter some of the cosmological consequences of the phase transition. Here, we\nstudy the hydrodynamical stability of deflagration fronts. We improve upon\nprevious studies by making a more careful and detailed analysis. In particular,\nwe take into account the fact that the equation of motion for the phase\ninterface depends separately on the temperature and fluid velocity on each side\nof the wall. Fluid variables on each side of the wall are similar for weakly\nfirst-order phase transitions, but differ significantly for stronger phase\ntransitions. As a consequence, we find that, for large enough supercooling, any\nsubsonic wall velocity becomes unstable. Moreover, as the velocity approaches\nthe speed of sound, perturbations become unstable on all wavelengths. For\nsmaller supercooling and small wall velocities, our results agree with those of\nprevious works. Essentially, perturbations on large wavelengths are unstable,\nunless the wall velocity is higher than a critical value. We also find a\npreviously unobserved range of marginally unstable wavelengths. We analyze the\ndynamical relevance of the instabilities, and we estimate the characteristic\ntime and length scales associated to their growth.

The progenitor models\nfor the SNIa available in the literature propose different distributions for\nregulating the explosion times of these events.

We find the answer\nis essentially no, unless one considers either extreme fine tuning, or possibly\nadding new beyond the standard model fields, which remove some of the more\nattractive features of the original idea. We also explore the possible\nimportance of a factor that has not previously been explicitly incorporated,\nnamely the gauge dependence of the effective potential used in calculating\ninflationary observables, e.g. $n_S$ and $r$, to see if this might provide\nadditional wiggle room. Such gauge effects are comparable to effects of Higgs\nmass uncertainties and other observables already considered in the analysis,\nand therefore they are relevant for constraining models. But, they are\ntherefore too small to remove the apparent incompatibility between the BICEP2\nobservation and the predictions of Higgs Inflation. \n\n"}

The recent results by the Planck\nsatellite mission have slightly changed the estimate of the baryonic density\ncompared to the previous WMAP analysis. This article updates the BBN\npredictions for the light elements using the cosmological parameters determined\nby Planck, as well as an improvement of the nuclear network and new\nspectroscopic observations. There is a slight lowering of the primordial Li/H\nabundance, however, this lithium value still remains typically 3 times larger\nthan its observed spectroscopic abundance in halo stars of the Galaxy.\nAccording to the importance of this \"lithium problem\", we trace the small\nchanges in its BBN calculated abundance following updates of the baryonic\ndensity, neutron lifetime and networks. In addition, for the first time, we\nprovide confidence limits for the production of 6Li, 9Be, 11B and CNO,\nresulting from our extensive Monte Carlo calculation with our extended network.\nA specific focus is cast on CNO primordial production. Considering\nuncertainties on the nuclear rates around the CNO formation, we obtain CNO/H\n\\approx (5-30) x 10^{-15}. We further improve this estimate by analyzing\ncorrelations between yields and reaction rates and identified new influential\nreaction rates. These uncertain rates, if simultaneously varied could lead to a\nsignificant increase of CNO production: CNO/H \\sim 10^{-13}. This result is\nimportant for the study of population III star formation during the dark ages. \n\n"}

First, the inflaton perturbation must account for much more than\n$10\\%$ of the curvature perturbation $\\zeta$, which barring fine-tuning means\nthat it accounts for practically all of it. It follows that a curvaton-like\nmechanism for generating $\\zeta$ requires an alternative to slow roll such as\nk-inflation. Second, accepting slow-roll inflation, the excursion of the\ninflaton field is at least of order Planck scale. As a result, the flatness of\nthe inflaton presumably requires a shift symmetry.\n  I point out that if such is the case, the resulting potential is likely to\nhave at least approximately the quadratic form suggested in 1983 by Linde,\nwhich is known to be compatible with the observed $r$ as well as the observed\nspectral index $\\ns$. The shift symmetry does not require supersymmetry. Also,\nthe big $H$ may rule out a GUT by restoring the symmetry and producing fatal\ncosmic strings.

In projection, the tracks of the\nmoving features cluster around an axis at position angle -166.6 deg that\nconnects the core with the standing feature. The moving features appear to\nemanate from the standing feature in a manner strikingly similar to the results\nof numerical 2-D relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic (RMHD) simulations in which\nmoving shocks are generated at a recollimation shock. Because of this, and the\nclose analogy to the jet feature HST-1 in M87, we identify the standing feature\nin BL Lac as a recollimation shock. We assume that the magnetic field dominates\nthe dynamics in the jet, and that the field is predominantly toroidal. From\nthis we suggest that the moving features are compressions established by slow\nand fast mode magneto-acoustic MHD waves.

It has led\nto the concept of binary-driven hypernovae (BdHNe) originating in a tight\nbinary system composed by a FeCO core on the verge of a SN explosion and a\ncompanion neutron star (NS).

These\ndifferences should be carefully understood before merger trees are used as\ninput for models of galaxy formation. We investigate the impact of different\nhalo merger trees on a semi-analytic model. We find that the z=0 galaxy\nproperties in our model show differences between trees when using a common\nparameter set. The star formation history of the Universe and the properties of\nsatellite galaxies can show marked differences between trees with different\nconstruction methods. Independently calibrating the semi-analytic model for\neach tree can reduce the discrepancies between the z=0 global galaxy\nproperties, at the cost of increasing the differences in the evolutionary\nhistories of galaxies. Furthermore, the underlying physics implied can vary,\nresulting in key quantities such as the supernova feedback efficiency differing\nby factors of 2.

Recent work has shown\nthat, with a polynomial parameterisation of the WIMP speed distribution, it is\npossible to make an unbiased measurement of the WIMP mass, without making any\nastrophysical assumptions. However, direct detection experiments are not\nsensitive to low-speed WIMPs and, therefore, any model-independent approach\nwill lead to a bias in the cross section. This problem can be solved with the\naddition of measurements of the flux of neutrinos from the Sun. This is because\nthe flux of neutrinos produced from the annihilation of WIMPs which have been\ngravitationally captured in the Sun is sensitive to low-speed WIMPs. Using mock\ndata from next-generation direct detection experiments and from the IceCube\nneutrino telescope, we show that the complementary information from IceCube on\nlow-speed WIMPs breaks the degeneracy between the cross section and the speed\ndistribution. This allows unbiased determinations of the WIMP mass and\nspin-independent and spin-dependent cross sections to be made, and the speed\ndistribution to be reconstructed.

We find that SMGs exhibit a relatively\ncomplex bias: some regions of high SMG overdensity are underdense in terms of\ndark matter mass, and some regions of high dark matter overdensity contain no\nSMGs. Because of their rarity, Poisson noise causes scatter in the SMG\noverdensity at fixed dark matter overdensity.

The wake of\nmerging galaxies in the ICM typically has a third to half the star mass seen in\nthe non-merging galaxies and 5% to 10 % less gas mass.

Such\napproximately universal relations are useful to break degeneracies in data\nanalysis for future radio, X-ray and gravitational wave observations. Although\nthe pressure inside compact stars is most likely nearly isotropic, certain\nscenarios have been put forth that suggest otherwise, for example due to phase\ntransitions. We here investigate whether pressure anisotropy affects the\napproximate universal relations and whether it prevents their use in future\nobservations. We achieve this by numerically constructing slowly-rotating and\ntidally-deformed, anisotropic, compact stars in General Relativity to third\norder in spin. We find that anisotropy affects the universal relations only\nweakly; the relations become less universal by a factor of 1.5-3 relative to\nthe isotropic case, but remain approximately universal to 10%. We succeed in\nexplaining this increase in variability as an increase in the eccentricity\nvariation of isodensity contours, which provides further support for the\nemergent approximate symmetry explanation of universality. Anisotropy does not\naffect the universal relations to a sufficient level to prevent their use in\ngravitational wave astrophysics or in experimental relativity. We provide an\nexplicit example of the latter in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity. The increase\nin variability of the universal relations due to pressure anisotropy could\naffect their use in future X-ray observations. Given expected observational\nuncertainties, however, the relations remain sufficiently universal for use in\nsuch observations if the anisotropic modifications to the moment of inertia and\nthe quadrupole moment are less than 10% of their isotropic values. \n\n"}

Besides finite\nsurvey-volume effects and flux-limits, our optimal estimation scheme\nincorporates several of the key tenets of galaxy formation: galaxies form and\nreside exclusively in dark matter haloes; a given dark matter halo may host\nseveral galaxies of various luminosities; galaxies inherit part of their\nlarge-scale bias from their host halo.

There it has long\nbeen probed observationally, in particular through peanut-shaped bulges. This\nsecular growth of bulges in modern disk galaxies is driven by weak,\nnon-axisymmetric instabilities: it mostly produces pseudo-bulges at slow rates\nand with long star-formation timescales. Disk instabilities at high redshift\n(z>1) in moderate-mass to massive galaxies (10^10 to a few 10^11 Msun of stars)\nare very different from those found in modern spiral galaxies. High-redshift\ndisks are globally unstable and fragment into giant clumps containing 10^8-10^9\nMsun of gas and stars each, which results in highly irregular galaxy\nmorphologies. The clumps and other features associated to the violent\ninstability drive disk evolution and bulge growth through various mechanisms,\non short timescales. The giant clumps can migrate inward and coalesce into the\nbulge in a few 10^8 yr. The instability in the very turbulent media drives\nintense gas inflows toward the bulge and nuclear region.

While the local model predicts this spatial modulation to be\nscale-independent, many variants have some scale-dependence. Here we note that\nthis scale dependence can be probed with measurements of frequency-spectrum\ndistortions in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), in particular\nhighlighting Compton-$y$ distortions.

This\nabundance ratio is much higher than those of spiral galaxies, and even among\nthe highest ones of S0 and elliptical galaxies.

Most studies so far have focused on large\ngalaxies, but dwarfs might also experience such events, since the halo mass\nfunction is scale-free in the concordance cosmological model. Notably, because\nof their low mass, most of their interactions will be with dark satellites. In\nthis paper we follow the evolution of gas-rich disky dwarf galaxies as they\nexperience a minor merger with a dark satellite. We aim to characterize the\neffects of such an interaction on the dwarf's star formation, morphology, and\nkinematical properties. We performed a suite of carefully set-up hydrodynamical\nsimulations of dwarf galaxies that include dark matter, gas, and stars merging\nwith a satellite consisting solely of dark matter. For the host system we vary\nthe gas fraction, disk size and thickness, halo mass, and concentration, while\nwe explore different masses, concentrations, and orbits for the satellite. We\nfind that the interactions cause strong starbursts of both short and long\nduration in the dwarfs. Their star formation rates increase by factors of a few\nto 10 or more. They are strongest for systems with extended gas disks and high\ngas fractions merging with a high-concentration satellite on a planar, radial\norbit. In contrast to analogous simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies, many of\nthe systems experience strong morphological changes and become spheroidal even\nin the presence of significant amounts of gas. The simulated systems compare\nremarkably well with the observational properties of a large selection of\nirregular dwarf galaxies and blue compact dwarfs. This implies that mergers\nwith dark satellites might well be happening but not be fully evident, and may\nthus play a role in the diversity of the dwarf galaxy population. \n\n"}

Specifically, by assuming that the ultra-relativistic particles\nproduced by the vacuum decay emerge into space-time in such a way that its\nenergy density $\\rho_r \\propto T^{4}$, the temperature evolution law and the\nincreasing entropy function are analytically calculated.

As the heavy field moves to the low-energy minimum, the inflaton\npotential could be significantly modified.

Abstract: We summarise some of the recent progress in understanding the formation and\nevolution of globular clusters (GCs) in the context of galaxy formation and\nevolution. It is discussed that an end-to-end model for GC formation and\nevolution should capture four different phases: (1) star and cluster formation\nin the high-pressure interstellar medium of high-redshift galaxies, (2) cluster\ndisruption by tidal shocks in the gas-rich host galaxy disc, (3) cluster\nmigration into the galaxy halo, and (4) the final evaporation-dominated\nevolution of GCs until the present day. Previous models have mainly focussed on\nphase 4. We present and discuss a simple model that includes each of these four\nsteps - its key difference with respect to previous work is the simultaneous\naddition of the high-redshift formation and early evolution of young GCs, as\nwell as their migration into galaxy haloes. The new model provides an excellent\nmatch to the observed GC mass spectrum and specific frequency, as well as the\nrelations of GCs to the host dark matter halo mass and supermassive black hole\nmass.

The\nhigh-density patches are 'pushed' by feedback, thereby driving turbulence and\nself-regulating local star formation. Sufficiently low-density patches,\nhowever, are accelerated to above the escape velocity before the region can\nself-adjust and are thus vented as outflows. In the\nturbulent-pressure-supported regime, when the gas fraction is $\\gtrsim 0.3$,\nthe ratio of the turbulent velocity dispersion to the circular velocity is\nsufficiently high that at any given time, of order half of the ISM has surface\ndensity less than the critical value and thus can be blown out on a dynamical\ntime.

Expanding the\ndistribution function around the Gaussian weight we formulate a perturbative\ntechnique to calculate non-linear corrections to cosmological correlators,\nsimilar to the diagrammatic expansion in a three-dimensional Euclidean quantum\nfield theory, with time playing the role of an external parameter. For the\nphysically relevant case of cold dark matter in an Einstein--de Sitter\nuniverse, the time evolution of the distribution function can be found exactly\nand is encapsulated by a time-dependent coupling constant controlling the\nperturbative expansion.

The\ncandidate selection is performed by combining several photometric approaches\nincluding a Bayesian probabilistic algorithm to reject stars and dwarfs. The\nspectroscopic identification was carried out with the Gran Telescopio Canarias\nand the Subaru Telescope for the first 80 deg2 of the survey footprint. The\nsuccess rate of our photometric selection is quite high, approaching 100 % at\nthe brighter magnitudes (zAB < 23.5 mag). Our selection also recovered all the\nknown high-z quasars on the HSC images.

The (stellar) mass dependent halo profile links\ntogether the local and global properties of the halo (e.g. inner slope and\n$M_{{\\rm halo}}$) which allows for measurements of $M_{{\\rm halo}}$ without\nvirial tracers. We compile a large sample of rotation curves from the\nliterature to test this halo profile. We find that this halo profile can\nexplain rotation curve observations over a wide range of $M_{\\star}$.

In this paper, we introduce the novel\nidea of using this extensive database to test the differential volume expansion\nrate predicted by two specific models, the concordance $\\Lambda$CDM and $R_{\\rm\nh}=ct$ cosmologies. For this purpose, we use two well-studied formulations of\nthe GLF, one based on pure luminosity evolution (PLE) and the other on a\nluminosity-dependent density evolution (LDDE).

This has been interpreted as a hint of the reionization of the\nintergalactic medium (IGM): the emitted Ly$\\alpha$ photons would be scattered\nby an increasingly neutral IGM at $z>6$.

The formation histories, and thus ages, of dark matter halos\ncorrelate with their large-scale density $\\rho$, an effect known as assembly\nbias. We test whether this correlation extends to galaxies by measuring the\ndependence of galaxy stellar age on $\\rho$. To clarify the comparison between\ntheory and observation, and to remove the strong environmental effects on\nsatellites, we use galaxy group catalogs to identify central galaxies and\nmeasure their quenched fraction, $f_Q$, as a function of large-scale\nenvironment. Models that match halo age to central galaxy age predict a strong\npositive correlation between $f_Q$ and $\\rho$. However, we show that the\namplitude of this effect depends on the definition of halo age: assembly bias\nis significantly reduced when removing the effects of splashback halos---those\nhalos that are central but have passed through a larger halo or experienced\nstrong tidal encounters. Defining age using halo mass at its peak value rather\nthan current mass removes these effects. In SDSS data, at M$_{\\rm gal}\\gtrsim\n10^{10.0}$ M_sol/h$^2$, there is a $\\sim 5\\%$ increase in $f_Q$ from low to\nhigh densities, which is in agreement with predictions of dark matter halos\nusing peak halo mass.

Both of\nthese criteria depend sensitively on whether and how perturbation modes of the\ninflaton interact and decohere. Decoherence is inevitable as a result of\ngravitationally-sourced interactions whose strength are proportional to the\nslow-roll parameters. However, the weakness of these interactions means that\ndecoherence is typically delayed until several Hubble times after modes grow\nbeyond the Hubble scale.

Thus far, all FRBs\nhave been detected with large single-dish telescopes with arcminute\nlocalizations, and attempts to identify their counterparts (source or host\ngalaxy) have relied on contemporaneous variability of field sources or the\npresence of peculiar field stars or galaxies.

We select them in the near-IR bands of the COSMOS2015 catalogue,\nwhich includes ultra-deep photometry from UltraVISTA-DR2, SPLASH, and\nSubaru/Hyper-SuprimeCam. At $z>2.5$ we use new precise photometric redshifts\nwith error $\\sigma_z=0.03(1+z)$ and an outlier fraction of $12\\%$, estimated by\nmeans of the unique spectroscopic sample of COSMOS. The increased exposure time\nin the DR2, along with our panchromatic detection strategy, allow us to improve\nthe stellar mass completeness at high $z$ with respect to previous UltraVISTA\ncatalogues. We also identify passive galaxies through a robust colour-colour\nselection, extending their SMF estimate up to $z=4$. Our work provides a\ncomprehensive view of galaxy stellar mass assembly between $z=0.1$ and 6, for\nthe first time using consistent estimates across the entire redshift range. We\nfit these measurements with a Schechter function, correcting for Eddington\nbias. We compare the SMF fit with the halo mass function predicted from\n$\\Lambda$CDM simulations. We find that at $z>3$ both functions decline with a\nsimilar slope in the high-mass end. This feature could be explained assuming\nthat the mechanisms that quench star formation in massive haloes become less\neffective at high redshift; however further work needs to be done to confirm\nthis scenario. Concerning the SMF low-mass end, it shows a progressive\nsteepening as moving towards higher redshifts, with $\\alpha$ decreasing from\n$-1.47_{-0.02}^{+0.02}$ at $z\\simeq0.1$ to $-2.11_{-0.13}^{+0.30}$ at\n$z\\simeq5$.

In the previous work it\nwas proposed to extend the gravity theory to allow free initial conditions,\nwith a motivation to solve the cosmological constant problem. This was done by\nsetting four constraints on metric variations in the action principle, which is\nreasonable because the gravity's physical degrees of freedom are at most six.\nHowever, there are two problems about this theory; the three constraints in\naddition to the unimodular condition were introduced without clear physical\nmeanings, and the flat Minkowski spacetime is unstable against perturbations.\nHere a new set of gravitational field equations is derived by replacing the\nthree constraints with new ones requiring that geodesic paths remain geodesic\nagainst metric variations.

In the case\nof chameleon theories, the screening has two contributions -- self-screening,\nwhich is due to the mass of an object itself, and environmental screening,\nwhich is caused by the surrounding matter -- which are often entangled, with\nthe second contribution being more crucial for less massive objects. A\nquantitative understanding of the effect of the environment on the screening\ncan prove critical in observational tests of such theories using systems such\nas the Local Group and dwarf galaxies, for which the environment may be\ninferred in various ways.

We show that gas evolves from a non-star-forming to a\nstar-forming state on a relatively short time scale and thus the rate of this\nevolution does not limit the star formation rate. Instead, the star formation\nrate is limited because only a small fraction of star-forming gas is converted\ninto stars before star-forming regions are dispersed by feedback and dynamical\nprocesses. Thus, gas cycles into and out of star-forming state multiple times,\nwhich results in a long time scale on which galaxies convert gas into stars.\nOur model does not rely on the assumption of equilibrium and can be used to\ninterpret trends of depletion times with the properties of observed galaxies\nand the parameters of star formation and feedback recipes in simulations. In\nparticular, the model explains how feedback self-regulates the star formation\nrate in simulations and makes it insensitive to the local star formation\nefficiency.

In this paper we consider the\nconstraints on both meanings of dark radiation based upon the newest results\nfor light-element nuclear reaction rates, observed light-element abundances and\nthe power spectrum of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Adding dark\nradiation during big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) alters the Friedmann expansion\nrate causing the nuclear reactions to freeze out at a different temperature.\nThis changes the final light element abundances at the end of BBN. Its\ninfluence on the CMB is to change the effective expansion rate at the surface\nof last scattering. We find that the BBN constraint reduces the allowed range\nfor both types of dark radiation at 10 Mev to between $-12.1\\%$ and $+6.2\\%$ of\nthe {\\bf total} background energy density at 10 Mev. Combining this result with\nfits to the CMB power spectrum, produces different results for particle vs.\nbrane-world dark radiation.

The IA self-calibration (SC) method was shown in previous studies to\nbe able to reduce the GI contamination by up to a factor of 10 for the 2-point\nand 3-point correlations. The SC method does not require to assume an IA model\nin its working and can extract the GI signal from the same photo-z survey\noffering the possibility to test and understand structure formation scenarios\nand their relationship to IA models. In this paper, we study the effects of the\nIA SC mitigation method on the precision and accuracy of cosmological parameter\nconstraints from future cosmic shear surveys LSST, WFIRST and Euclid. We\nperform analytical and numerical calculations to estimate the loss of precision\nand the residual bias in the best fit cosmological parameters after the\nself-calibration is performed. We take into account uncertainties from\nphotometric redshifts and the galaxy bias. We find that the confidence contours\nare slightly inflated from applying the SC method itself while a significant\nincrease is due to the inclusion of the photo-z uncertainties.

Within the cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm, the number of low-mass\nsubhalos within lens galaxies is expected to be large, implying that their\ncontribution to the lensing convergence field is approximately Gaussian and\ncould thus be described by their power spectrum. We develop here a general\nformalism to compute from first principles the substructure convergence power\nspectrum for different populations of dark matter subhalos. As an example, we\napply our framework to two distinct subhalo populations: a truncated\nNavarro-Frenk-White subhalo population motivated by standard CDM, and a\ntruncated cored subhalo population motivated by self-interacting dark matter\n(SIDM). We study in detail how the subhalo abundance, mass function, internal\ndensity profile, and concentration affect the amplitude and shape of the\nsubstructure power spectrum. We determine that the power spectrum is mostly\nsensitive to a specific combination of the subhalo abundance and moments of the\nmass function, as well as to the average tidal truncation scale of the largest\nsubhalos included in the analysis. Interestingly, we show that the asymptotic\nslope of the substructure power spectrum at large wave number reflects the\ninternal density profile of the subhalos. In particular, the SIDM power\nspectrum exhibits a characteristic steepening at large wave number absent in\nthe CDM power spectrum, opening the possibility of using this observable, if at\nall measurable, to discern between these two scenarios. \n\n"}

In this paper, we follow the detailed\nevolution of the non-Gaussianity through the transition phase into the\nslow-roll attractor phase, considering different types of transition. We find\nthat the transition process has important effect on the size of the local\nnon-Gaussianity. We first compute the net contribution of the non-Gaussianities\nat the end of inflation in canonical non-attractor models. If the curvature\nperturbations keep evolving during the transition - such as in the case of\nsmooth transition or some sharp transition scenarios - the $\\mathcal{O}(1)$\nlocal non-Gaussianity generated in the non-attractor phase can be completely\nerased by the subsequent evolution, although the consistency relation remains\nviolated. In extremal cases of sharp transition where the super-horizon modes\nfreeze immediately right after the end of the non-attractor phase, the original\nnon-attractor result can be recovered. We also study models with non-canonical\nkinetic terms, and find that the transition can typically contribute a\nsuppression factor in the squeezed bispectrum, but the final local\nnon-Gaussianity can still be made parametrically large. \n\n"}

We report that the merger shocks (with Mach number\n$\\mathcal{M}\\sim2-5$) are the most effective CR producers, while high-Mach\nperipheral shocks (i.e. $\\mathcal{M}>5$) are mainly responsible for the\nbrightest phase of CR injection in clusters. Clusters once merged, permanently\ndeviate from CR and X-ray mass scaling of non-merging systems, enabling us to\nuse it as a tool to determine the state of merger. Through a temporal and\nspatial evolution study, we found a strong correlation between cluster merger\ndynamics and CR injection. We observed that the brightest phase of X-ray and CR\ninjection from clusters occur respectively at about 1.0 and 1.5 Gyr after every\nmergers, and CR injection peaks near to the cluster virial radius (i.e\n$r_{200}$). Delayed CR injection peaks found in this study deserve further\ninvestigation for possible impact on the evolution of CR-derived observables\nfrom galaxy clusters. \n\n"}

Nevertheless it\nremains an open question of how to optimally extract the information and how\nwell the matter power spectrum must be known to obtain unbiased cosmological\nparameter estimates. By performing a Principal Component Analysis (PCA), we\nquantify the sensitivity of 3D cosmic shear and tomography with different\nbinning strategies to different regions of the lensing kernel and matter power\nspectrum, and hence the background geometry and growth of structure in the\nUniverse. We find that a large number of equally spaced tomographic bins in\nredshift can extract nearly all the cosmological information without the\nadditional computational expense of 3D cosmic shear. Meanwhile a large fraction\nof the information comes from small poorly understood scales in the matter\npower spectrum, that can lead to biases on measurements of cosmological\nparameters. In light of this, we define and compute a cosmology-independent\nmeasure of the bias due to imperfect knowledge of the power spectrum.

Abstract: The similarity between the distributions of spins for galaxies ($\\lambda_{\\rm\ng}$) and for dark-matter haloes ($\\lambda_{\\rm h}$), indicated both by\nsimulations and observations, is naively interpreted as a one-to-one\ncorrelation between the spins of a galaxy and its host halo. This is used to\npredict galaxy sizes in semi-analytic models via $R_{\\rm e}\\simeq\\lambda_{\\rm\nh} R_{\\rm v}$, with $R_{\\rm e}$ the half-mass radius of the galaxy and $R_{\\rm\nv}$ the halo radius. Utilizing two different suites of zoom-in cosmological\nsimulations, we find that $\\lambda_{\\rm g}$ and $\\lambda_{\\rm h}$ are in fact\nonly barely correlated, especially at $z\\geq 1$. A general smearing of this\ncorrelation is expected based on the different spin histories, where the more\nrecently accreted baryons through streams gain and then lose significant\nangular momentum compared to the gradually accumulated dark matter. Expecting\nthe spins of baryons and dark matter to be correlated at accretion into $R_{\\rm\nv}$, the null correlation at the end reflects an anti-correlation between\n$\\lambda_{\\rm g}/\\lambda_{\\rm h}$ and $\\lambda_{\\rm h}$, which can partly arise\nfrom mergers and a compact star-forming phase that many galaxies undergo.

The galaxy spin is better correlated with\nthe spin of the inner halo, but this largely reflects the effect of the baryons\non the halo.

This is\nthe main question addressed in the present analysis. We also discuss the\nvalidity of Derrick's theorem when scalar fields are embedded in non-trivial\ngravitational backgrounds. In the context of the above question, we consider\nthree global defect configurations: a finite thickness spherical domain wall\nwith a central S-dS black hole, a global string loop with a S-dS black hole in\nthe center and a global monopole near a S-dS black hole. Using an analytical\nmodel and numerical simulations of the evolving spherical wall we show that the\nspherical wall experiences a repelling gravitational potential due to the mass\nof the central black hole. This potential is further amplified by the presence\nof a cosmological constant. For initial domain wall radius larger than a\ncritical value, the repulsive potential dominates over the wall tension and the\nwall expands towards the cosmological horizon of the S-dS metric where it\ndevelops ghost instabilities. For smaller initial radius, tension dominates and\nthe wall contracts towards the black hole horizon where it also develops ghost\ninstabilities.

In this study we pay special attention to\ntracing the time evolution of the ionizing photons' escape fraction, which\naffects the distribution of neutral hydrogen, by performing radiation\nhydrodynamics (RHD) simulations resolving dense gas in a halo. We find that the\nradial profile of 21-cm differential brightness temperature is quite sensitive\nto the stellar and halo masses, which reflects the time evolution of the escape\nfraction. In the case of a less massive star, ionizing photons hardly escape\nfrom its host halo due to the absorption by dense halo gas, thus an deep 21-cm\nabsorption feature at just outside the halo lasts a long time. Whereas photons\nfrom a massive star well working to heat the ambient intergalactic medium turn\nout to cause a spatially extended 21-cm emission signature. Although individual\nsignals are found to be undetectable with the Square Kilometre Array, our\nanalysis using the results from the RHD simulations indicates that the\nproperties of the first stars are imprinted on the 21-cm global signal: its\namplitude depends not only on the cosmic star formation rate density, but also\non the typical mass of the first stars due to the stellar-mass-dependent\nheating rate. Thus, we suggest that the initial mass function of the first\nstars is an essential factor in understanding the global signal. \n\n"}

The OI emission distribution is compared to the CO 16-15, CII\n158 micron, and CO 11-10 lines, mm-molecular lines, and continuum. It is\ncomposed of several velocity components in the range from -30 km/s to 25 km/s.\nThe high-velocity blue- and redshifted emission can be explained as arising\nfrom accelerated photodissociated (PDR) gas associated with a dark lane close\nto the massive binary system S106 IR, and from shocks caused by the stellar\nwind and/or a disk--envelope interaction. At velocities from -9 to -4 km/s and\n0.5 to 8 km/s line wings are observed that we attribute to cooling in PDRs\ncreated by the ionizing radiation impinging on the cavity walls. The bulk\nvelocity range is dominated by PDR emission from the clumpy molecular cloud.\nModelling the emission in the different velocity ranges with the KOSMA-tau code\nconstrains a radiation field chi of a few times 10^4 and densities n of a few\ntimes 10^4 cm^-3. Considering self-absorption of the OI line results in higher\ndensities (up to 10^6 cm^-3) only for the gas component seen at high blue- and\nred velocities. The dark lane has a mass of 275 Msun and shows a velocity\ndifference of 1.4 km/s along its projected length of 1 pc, determined from\nH13CO+ 1-0 mapping.

We describe the multi-component sky as seen by Planck, the\nsuccess of the LCDM model, and the connection to lower-redshift probes of\nstructure formation. We also give a comprehensive summary of the major changes\nintroduced in this 2018 release. The Planck data, alone and in combination with\nother probes, provide stringent constraints on our models of the early Universe\nand the large-scale structure within which all astrophysical objects form and\nevolve. We discuss some lessons learned from the Planck mission, and highlight\nareas ripe for further experimental advances. \n\n"}

Recent inferences of the\nluminosity function suffer from inconsistencies arising from inhomogeneous\nselection and analysis of AGN data. We address this problem by constructing a\nsample of more than 80,000 colour-selected AGN from redshift z=0 to 7.5. While\nthis sample is composed of multiple data sets with spectroscopic redshifts and\ncompleteness estimates, we homogenise these data sets to identical cosmologies,\nintrinsic AGN spectra, and magnitude systems. Using this sample, we derive the\nAGN UV luminosity function from redshift z=0 to 7.5. The luminosity function\nhas a double power law form at all redshifts. The break magnitude $M_*$ of the\nAGN luminosity function shows a steep brightening from $M_*\\sim -24$ at z=0.7\nto $M_*\\sim -29$ at z=6. The faint-end slope $\\beta$ significantly steepens\nfrom $-1.7$ at $z<2.2$ to $-2.4$ at $z\\simeq 6$.

In particular, a near-horizon quantum violation of the\nequivalence principle has been proposed as a resolution of the black hole\ninformation paradox. Such a violation may lead to a modified dispersion\nrelation at high energies, which could become relevant due to the intense\ngravitational blueshift experienced by ingoing gravitational waves.

In this paper, we review the modeling of these two components of\nthe polarized Galactic emission and present our strategy for optimally\nexploiting the currently existing data sets. We investigate a Markov Chain\nMonte Carlo (MCMC) method to constrain the model parameter space through\nmaximum-likelihood analysis, focusing mainly on dust polarized emission.\nRelying on simulations, we demonstrate that our methodology can be used to\nconstrain the regular GMF geometry. Fitting for the reduced Stokes parameters,\nthis reconstruction is only marginally dependent of the accuracy of the\nreconstruction of the Galactic dust grain density distribution. However, the\nreconstruction degrades, apart from the pitch angle, when including a turbulent\ncomponent on the order of the regular one as suggested by current observational\nconstraints.

Lyman-$\\alpha$ coupling is\nassumed to be saturated, we therefore probe the nature of non-Gaussianities\nproduced by X-ray heating processes. We find the evolution of the normalised\nbispectrum to be very different from that of the power spectrum. It exhibits a\nturnover whose peak moves from large to small scales with decreasing redshift,\nand corresponds to the typical separation of emission regions. This\ncharacteristic scale reduces as more and more regions move into emission with\ntime. Ultimately, small-scale fluctuations within heated regions come to\ndominate the normalised bispectrum, which at the end of the simulation is\nalmost entirely driven by fluctuations in the density field. To establish how\ngeneric the qualitative evolution of the normalised bispectrum we see in the\nstellar + HMXB simulation is, we examine several other simulations - two\nfully-numerical simulations that include QSO sources, and two with contrasting\nsource properties produced with the semi-numerical simulation 21cmFAST.

Abstract: M87 has been identified as a displaced supermassive black hole (SMBH)\ncandidate. We investigated this possibility by a temporal analysis of twelve\nAdaptive-Optics assisted-VLT and HST images spanning twenty years. We found\nthat the centre of the isophotal fitting to the nuclear region of M87 -assumed\nto mark the centre of mass of the galaxy- changes location depending on the\nimage and size of the image analysed. In an absolute frame of reference, the\nchange varies from 15 to 130 miliarcseconds (mas) with respect to the active\ngalactic nucleus (AGN), which remains stable within an uncertainty of $\\pm$15\nmas in both x and y axis. The temporal analysis of the results indicates that\nthe major displacements measured coincide with a powerful outburst that took\nplace between 2003 and 2007, where there was a flux increment in the nucleus\nand the first knot of the jet. After the outburst, the isophotal centre remains\nstable and is consistent with the AGN location. This suggests that the\ndisplacements are artificially caused by a flux variation in the galaxy and\nthat the SMBH actually resides in the equilibrium position.

Older clusters tend to be more concentrated than younger clusters.\nTheir structure, represented by the characteristic radius $r_s$ and mass $M_s$\nof the Navarro--Frenk--White (NFW) density profile, is related to their\nformation time. In~this study, we showed that $r_s$, $M_s$, and the X-ray\ntemperature of the intracluster medium (ICM), $T_X$, form a thin plane in the\nspace of $(\\log r_s, \\log M_s, \\log T_X)$. This tight correlation indicates\nthat the ICM temperature is also determined by the formation time of individual\nclusters. Numerical simulations showed that clusters move along the fundamental\nplane as they evolve. The plane and the cluster evolution within the plane\ncould be explained by a similarity solution of structure formation of the\nuniverse. The angle of the plane shows that clusters have not achieved \"virial\nequilibrium\" in the sense that mass/size growth and pressure at the boundaries\ncannot be ignored.

About half the gas shock heats to roughly the virial temperature\nof the galaxy potential well before cooling, condensing, and forming stars, but\nthe other half radiates its acquired gravitational energy at much lower\ntemperatures, typically T<10^5 K, and the histogram of maximum gas temperatures\nis clearly bimodal. The \"cold mode\" of gas accretion dominates for low mass\ngalaxies (M_baryon < 10^{10.3}Msun or M_halo < 10^{11.4}Msun), while the\nconventional \"hot mode\" dominates the growth of high mass systems. Cold\naccretion is often directed along filaments, allowing galaxies to efficiently\ndraw gas from large distances, while hot accretion is quasi-spherical. The\ngalaxy and halo mass dependence leads to redshift and environment dependence of\ncold and hot accretion rates, with cold mode dominating at high redshift and in\nlow density regions today, and hot mode dominating in group and cluster\nenvironments at low redshift. Star formation rates closely track accretion\nrates, and we discuss the physics behind the observed environment and redshift\ndependence of galactic scale star formation. If we allowed hot accretion to be\nsuppressed by conduction or AGN feedback, then the simulation predictions would\nchange in interesting ways, perhaps resolving conflicts with the colors of\nellipticals and the cutoff of the galaxy luminosity function.

At z=1 most luminous galaxies have\nmorphologies of early-to-mid Hubble-types, and many show transformations\nbetween their rest-frame UV-optical morphologies.

At z=1, the size-luminosity\ndistribution is broadly consistent with that of local galaxies, with passive\nevolution. However, galaxies at z=2.3 are smaller than the large present-day\ngalaxies, and must continue to grow in size and stellar mass. We have measured\nthe galaxies' UV-optical ICD, which quantifies differences in morphology and\nthe relative amount of on-going star-formation.

This is because stellar velocity\ndispersion, sigma, increases only weakly with L for BCGs and other giant\nellipticals. The Mbh-L relationship predicts that the most luminous BCGs may\nhave Mbh approaching 10^{10}M_sol, while the M-sigma relationship always\npredicts Mbh<3X10^9M_sol. We argue that the Mbh-L relationship is a plausible\nor even preferred description for BCGs and other galaxies of similar\nluminosity. If cores in central stellar density are formed by binary BHs, then\nthe inner-core cusp radius, r_gamma, may be an independent witness of Mbh.\nUsing structural parameters derived from a large sample of early-type galaxies\nobserved by HST, we argue that L is superior to sigma as an indicator of\nr_gamma in luminous galaxies. The observed r_gamma-Mbh relationship for 11 core\ngalaxies with measured Mbh appears to be consistent with the Mbh-L relationship\nfor BCGs. BCGs have large cores appropriate for their large luminosities that\nmay be difficult to generate with the modest BH masses inferred from the\nMbh-sigma relationship. Mbh~L may be expected to hold for BCGs, if they were\nformed in dissipationless mergers, which should preserve ratio of BH to stellar\nmass. This picture appears to be consistent with the slow increase in sigma\nwith L and the more rapid increase in effective radii with L seen in BCGs. If\nBCGs have large BHs commensurate with their luminosities, then the local BH\nmass function for Mbh>3X10^9M_sol may be nearly an order of magnitude richer\nthan that inferred from the Mbh-sigma relationship.

However, upon investigating the\nspectral evolution with multiple XMM-Newton observations, we found that the\ncool disk component failed to follow this relation with a confidence level of\n0.999964. Indeed, the luminosity decreases as the temperature increases, and\nthe luminosities at high temperatures are more than an order of magnitude less\nthan expected from the $L\\propto T^4$ extrapolation of luminosities at low\ntemperatures. This places a strong constraint against the validity of modeling\nthe X-ray spectra of NGC 1313 X-2 as emission from the accretion disk of an\nIMBH.

We argue that the increase in\nthe radio-loud fraction with AGN luminosity in optically-selected quasar\nsamples is consistent with this picture. We also use the ratio of black holes\ntoday to quasars at z~2 to conclude that the most bolometrically-luminous AGN,\neither radio-loud or radio quiet, are constrained to have lifetimes <~10^8 yr.\nIf radio sources are associated with black holes of >~10^9 M_sun at all\nredshifts, then the same lifetime constraint applies to all radio sources with\nluminosities above L_5GHz ~ 10^24 W/Hz/sr. \n\n"}

Our results highlight\nthe importance of tangential velocity dispersions to obtain density profiles\nshallower than $1/r^2$ in the core regions, and for retaining a memory of the\ninitial density profile, in self-similar collapse. For an isotropic core\nvelocity dispersion only a partial memory of the initial density profile is\nretained. If tangential velocity dispersions in the core are constrained to be\nless than the radial dispersion, a cuspy core density profile shallower than\n$1/r$ cannot obtain, in self-similar collapse. \n\n"}

The\nrefraction index and spin properties of the solutions interior to the wall are\nanalyzed in detail. It is shown that the gravitational waves suffer a\nrefraction process by domain walls. The reflection and transmission\ncoefficients are derived in the thin wall limit. In relation to the spin\ncontent, it is shown that the ``$\\times$'' helicity 2 gravitational wave mode\nmaintains in the domain wall the same polarization state as in vacuum. On the\ncontrary, the ``+'' mode, of pure helicity 2 in vacuum, is contaminated inside\nthe wall with a spin 0 state, as well as with spin 2, helicity 0 and 1 states. \n\n"}
