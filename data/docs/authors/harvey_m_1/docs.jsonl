Although the stability of the operator product expansion side seems\nto break down at T > 1.06Tc for the vector channel and T>1.04Tc for the\npseudoscalar channel, we find a sudden change of the spectral property across\nthe critical temperature Tc, which originates from an equally rapid change of\nthe scalar gluon condensate characterized by e-3p.

Our method takes advantage of the same\nelectron bunch to produce both an XFEL pulse and an ultrashort optical pulse\nwith the help of an optical radiator downstream of the x-ray undulator. Since\nboth pulses are produced by the same electron bunch, they are perfectly\nsynchronized. Application of cross-correlation techniques will allow to\ndetermine relative jitter between the optical pulse (and, thus, the XFEL pulse)\nand a pulse from an external pump-laser with femtosecond resolution. Technical\nrealization of the proposed timing scheme uses an optical replica synthesizer\n(ORS) setup to be installed after the final bunch-compression stage of the\nXFEL. The electron bunch is modulated in the ORS setup by an external optical\nlaser. Subsequently, it travels through the main undulator, and produces the\nXFEL pulse. Finally, a powerful optical pulse of coherent edge radiation is\ngenerated as the bunch passes through a long straight section and a separation\nmagnet downstream of the main undulator.

This hybrid approach is based on the Ultra-relativistic\nQuantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD) transport approach with an intermediate\nhydrodynamical evolution for the hot and dense stage of the collision.\nEvent-by-event fluctuations are directly taken into account via the\nnon-equilibrium initial conditions generated by the initial collisions and\nstring fragmentations in the microscopic UrQMD model. After a (3+1)-dimensional\nideal hydrodynamic evolution, the hydrodynamical fields are mapped to hadrons\nvia the Cooper-Frye equation and the subsequent hadronic cascade calculation\nwithin UrQMD proceeds to incorporate the important final state effects for a\nrealistic freeze-out. This implementation allows to compare pure microscopic\ntransport calculations with hydrodynamic calculations using exactly the same\ninitial conditions and freeze-out procedure.

To model the real-time non-perturbative effects in the\npropagation of a high energy jet through the strongly coupled QCD matter, we\nadopt an effective dimensionally reduced description in terms of the $(1+1)$\nquasi-Abelian Schwinger theory. This theory is exactly soluble at any value of\nthe coupling and shares with QCD the properties of dynamical generation of\n\"mesons\" with a finite mass and the screening of \"quark\" charge that are\ncrucial for describing the transition of the jet into hadrons.

We argue that the low energy relations representing the\nquantum anomalies of QCD are saturated by coherent low dimensional vacuum\nconfigurations as observed in Monte Carlo lattice studies. The thermal spectrum\nand approximate universality of the temperature with no dependence on energy of\ncolliding particles in this framework is due to the fact that the emission\nresults from the distortion of these low dimensional vacuum sheets rather than\nfrom the colliding particles themselves. The emergence of the long- range\ncorrelations of P odd domains (a feature which is apparently required for\nexplanation of the asymmetry observed at RHIC and LHC) is also a result of the\nsame distortion of the QCD vacuum configurations.

We find the resulting RMF and SHF\nparametrizations give broadly consistent predictions of the symmetry energy J\nand its slope parameter L at saturation density within a tight range of <~2 MeV\nand <~6 MeV respectively, but that clear model dependence shows up in the\npredictions of higher-order symmetry energy parameters, leading to important\ndifferences in (a) the slope of the correlation between J and L from the\nconfidence ellipse, (b) the isospin-dependent part of the incompressibility of\nnuclear matter K_tau, (c) the symmetry energy at supra-saturation densities,\nand (d) the predicted neutron star radii.

The goal of\nthe optimized scheme proposed here is to enable experimental simplification and\nperformance improvement. The core of the scheme is composed by soft and hard\nX-ray self-seeding setups. Based on the use of an improved design for both\nmonochromators it is possible to increase the design electron energy up to 17.5\nGeV in photon energy range between 2 keV and 13 keV, which is the most\npreferable for life science experiments. An advantage of operating at such high\nelectron energy is the increase of the X-ray output peak power. Another\nadvantage is that 17.5 GeV is the preferred operation energy for SASE1 and\nSASE2 beamline users. Since it will be necessary to run all the XFEL lines at\nthe same electron energy, this choice will reduce the interference with other\nundulator lines and increase the total amount of scheduled beam time.

We calculate the two-gluon production cross section while\nincluding all-order saturation effects in the heavy nucleus with the\nlowest-order rescattering in the lighter nucleus. We find four types of\ncorrelations in the two-gluon production cross section: (i) geometric\ncorrelations, (ii) HBT correlations accompanied by a back-to-back maximum,\n(iii) away-side correlations, and (iv) near-side azimuthal correlations which\nare long-range in rapidity. The geometric correlations (i) are due to the fact\nthat nucleons are correlated by simply being confined within the same nucleus\nand may lead to long-range rapidity correlations for the produced particles\nwithout strong azimuthal angle dependence. Somewhat surprisingly, long-range\nrapidity correlations (iii) and (iv) have exactly the same amplitudes along\nwith azimuthal and rapidity shapes: one centered around \\Delta \\phi =\\pi\\ with\nthe other one centered around \\Delta \\phi =0 (here \\Delta \\phi\\ is the\nazimuthal angle between the two produced gluons).

For the analysis we employ three different transport models - the\nmicroscopic off-shell Hadron-String-Dynamics (HSD) transport approach, the\nIsospin Quantum Molecular Dynamics (IQMD) approach as well as the\nUltra-relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD) approach. We confirm the\nexperimentally observed enhancement of the dilepton yield (normalized to the\nmultiplicity of neutral pions $N_{\\pi^0}$) in heavy-ion collisions with respect\nto that measured in $NN = (pp+pn)/2$ collisions. We identify two contributions\nto this enhancement: a) the $pN$ bremsstrahlung which scales with the number of\ncollisions and not with the number of participants, i.e. pions; b) the dilepton\nemission from intermediate $\\Delta$'s which are part of the reaction cycles\n$\\Delta \\to \\pi N ; \\pi N \\to \\Delta$ and $NN\\to N\\Delta; N\\Delta \\to NN$.

As a\nresult, the initial potential energy at the entrance of a bending system, which\nwe call pseudo (kinetic) energy, is indistinguishable from the usual kinetic\nenergy offset from the design energy in its perturbation to particle optics\nthrough dispersion and momentum compaction.

Large and regular glitches observed in the\nVela pulsar have originally constrained the fraction of the stellar moment of\ninertia that must reside in the solid crust to about 1.4%. However, crustal\nentrainment-which until very recently has been ignored-suggests that in order\nto account for the Vela glitches, the fraction of the moment of inertia\nresiding in the crust must increase to about 7%. This indicates that the\nrequired angular momentum reservoir may exceed that which is available in the\ncrust. We explore the possibility that uncertainties in the equation of state\nprovide enough flexibility for the construction of models that predict a large\ncrustal thickness and consequently a large crustal moment of inertia. Given\nthat analytic results suggest that the crustal moment of inertia is sensitive\nto the transition pressure at the crust-core interface, we tune the parameters\nof the model to maximize the transition pressure, while still providing an\nexcellent description of nuclear observables. In this manner we are able to\nobtain fractional moments of inertia as large as 7% for neutron stars with\nmasses below 1.6 solar masses. In particular, we find that if the neutron-skin\nthickness of 208Pb falls within the (0.20-0.26) fm range, large enough\ntransition pressures can be generated to explain the large Vela glitches\nwithout invoking an additional angular-momentum reservoir beyond that confined\nto the solid crust.

In general,\nthese models assume that hard process rates and the magnitude of the soft event\nactivity in the underlying $NN$ collisions is uncorrelated.

{"id": "1503.03437", "contents": "Title: Microscopic analysis of fusion hindrance in heavy systems Abstract: Background: Heavy-ion fusion reactions involving heavy nuclei at energies\naround the Coulomb barrier exhibit fusion hindrance, where the probability of\ncompound nucleus formation is strongly hindered compared with that in light-\nand medium-mass systems. The origin of this fusion hindrance has not been well\nunderstood from a microscopic point of view. Purpose: Analyze the fusion\ndynamics in heavy systems by a microscopic reaction model and understand the\norigin of the fusion hindrance. Method: We employ the time-dependent\nHartree-Fock (TDHF) theory. We extract nucleus--nucleus potential and energy\ndissipation by the method combining TDHF dynamics of the entrance channel of\nfusion reactions with one-dimensional Newton equation including a dissipation\nterm. Then, we analyze the origin of the fusion hindrance using the properties\nof the extracted potential and energy dissipation. Results: Extracted\npotentials show monotonic increase as the relative distance of two nuclei\ndecreases, which induces the disappearance of an ordinary barrier structure of\nthe potential. This is different from those in light- and medium-mass systems\nand from density-constraint TDHF calculations. Extracted friction coefficients\nshow sizable energy dependence and universal value of their magnitude, which\nare rather similar to those in light- and medium-mass systems. Using these\nproperties, we analyze the origin of the fusion hindrance and find that\ncontribution of the increase in potential to the extra-push energy is larger\nthan that of the accumulated dissipation energy in most systems studied in this\narticle. Conclusions: By the analysis of the origin of the fusion hindrance, we\nconclude that, as the system becomes heavier, the dynamical increase in\npotential at small relative distances plays a more important role than the\ndissipation during the fusion reaction for understanding the origin of the\nfusion hindrance. \n\n"}

The\ndepinning is affected by the purity of the material, and the size of the\npinning centers, as well as the cavity operation frequency.

At $14.4$ keV, third generation synchrotron radiation sources produce\na maximum of $10^{10}$ photons per second in a meV bandwidth. In this work we\ndiscuss about the possibility of increasing this flux a thousand-fold by\nexploiting high repetition rate self-seeded pulses at the European XFEL. Here\nwe report on a feasibility study for an optimized configuration of the SASE2\nbeamline at the European XFEL which combines self-seeding and undulator\ntapering techniques in order to increase the average spectral flux at $14.4$\nkeV. In particular, we propose to perform monochromatization at $7.2$ keV with\nthe help of self-seeding, and amplify the seed in the first part of output\nundulator. The amplification process can be stopped at a position well before\nsaturation, where the electron beam gets considerable bunching at the 2nd\nharmonic of the coherent radiation. A second part of the output undulator\nfollows, tuned to the 2nd harmonic frequency, i.e. at $14.4$ keV and is used to\nobtain saturation at this energy. One can further prolong the exchange of\nenergy between the photon and the electron beam by tapering the last part of\nthe output undulator. We performed start-to-end simulations and demonstrate\nthat self-seeding, combined with undulator tapering, allows one to achieve more\nthan a hundred-fold increase in average spectral flux compared with the nominal\nSASE regime at saturation, resulting in a maximum flux of order $10^{13}$\nphotons per second in a meV bandwidth. \n\n"}

This would be\nalmost six orders of magnitude smaller than the present upper limit, and will\nprovide a stringent test of the standard model.\n  Resonant polarimetry, made practical by the large polarized beam charge, is\nthe key (most novel, least proven) element of the method. Along with the\nphase-locked, rolling polarization \"Koop spin wheel,\" resonant polarimetry\nmeasures beam polarization as amplitude rather than as intensity.\n  The polarization roll, at 100\\,Hz for example, and adjustable by a constant\ncontrol current, causes spurious torques due to field errors to average to zero\nto high accuracy. Since these torques have been considered to be the dominant\nsource of systematic error in truly frozen spin operation, this is a major\nimprovement resulting from the rolling polarization. Important sources of\nsystematic errors remain, the main one being due to Wien filter reversal\nuncertainty.\n  Both electron and proton spins can be \"frozen\" in all-electric storage rings,\nand their EDM precisions should be comparable.

The evolution of the\nphysics of the atomic nucleus went through many stages as more data become\navailable. We briefly discuss models introduced to discern the physics behind\nthe experimental discoveries, such as the shell model, the collective model,\nthe statistical model, the interacting boson model, etc., some of these models\nmay be seemingly in conflict with each other, but this was shown to be only\napparent.\n  The richness of the ideas and abundance of theoretical models attests to the\nimportant fact that the nucleus is a really singular system in the sense that\nit evolves from two-body bound states such as the deuteron, to few-body bound\nstates, such as $^4$He, $^7$Li, $^9$Be etc. and up the ladder to heavier bound\nnuclei containing up to more than 200 nucleons.

The existing background subtraction methods for these studies depend on\nseveral assumptions and independent measurements of the Fourier coefficients of\nthe combinatorial background.

To test the accuracy of these methods, a simple model is used to\nsimulate di-hadron and jet-hadron correlations with a combinatorial background\nsimilar to that observed in the data.

Its extension to the\nmulti-reference level allows for restoring symmetries and, in turn, for\ncalculating transition rates.\n  [Purpose] We propose a new no-core-configuration-interaction (NCCI) model\ntreating properly isospin and rotational symmetries. The model is applicable to\nany nucleus irrespective of its mass and neutron- and proton-number parity. It\nproperly includes polarization effects caused by an interplay between the long-\nand short-range forces acting in the atomic nucleus.\n  [Methods] The method is based on solving the Hill-Wheeler-Griffin equation\nwithin a model space built of linearly-dependent states having good angular\nmomentum and properly treated isobaric spin. The states are generated by means\nof the isospin and angular-momentum projection applied to a set of low-lying\n(multi)particle-(multi)hole deformed Slater determinants calculated using the\nself-consistent Skyrme-Hartree-Fock approach.\n  [Results] The theory is applied to calculate energy spectra in N~Z nuclei\nthat are relevant from the point of view of a study of superallowed Fermi\nbeta-decays. In particular, a new set of the isospin-symmetry-breaking\ncorrections to these decays is given.\n  [Conclusions] It is demonstrated that the NCCI model is capable to capture\nmain features of low-lying energy spectra in light and medium-mass nuclei using\nrelatively small model space and without any local readjustment of its\nlow-energy coupling constants. Its flexibility and a range of applicability\nmakes it an interesting alternative to the conventional nuclear shell model. \n\n"}

We focus on\nionisation injection configurations and in the conditions where the laser pulse\ndriver can force collective betatron oscillations over the whole trapped\nelectron bunch. With an analytical model and by employing three dimensional\nsimulations and radiation calculations, we find that circularly or elliptically\npolarised laser drivers can force helical betatron oscillations, which produce\ncircularly/elliptically polarised betatron x-rays. We assess the level of\npolarisation numerically and analytically, and find that the number of\ncircularly polarised photons can be controlled by tuning the laser pulse driver\npolarisation. We show the production of betatron radiation that is circularly\npolarised up to < 40% close to regions of maximum photon flux. The total flux\nof circularly polarised betatron radiation drops for elliptically polarised\ndrivers, and is negligible when using linear polarisation.

The validity of these short-bunch wakes holds not\nonly for the corrugated structure, but rather for any flat structure whose\nbeam-cavity interaction can be described by a surface impedance.

Collimators remove beam halo particles,\nso that they do not impinge on vulnerable regions of the machine, such as the\nsuperconducting magnets and the experimental areas. In simulating the effect of\nthe collimator jaws it is crucial to model the scattering of protons at small\nmomentum transfer~$t$,as these protons can subsequently survive several turns\nof the ring before being lost. At high energies these soft processes are well\ndescribed by Pomeron exchange models. We study the behaviour of elastic and\nsingle-diffractive dissociation cross sections over a wide range of energy, and\nshow that the model can be used as a global description of the wide variety of\nhigh energy elastic and diffractive data presently available. In particular it\nmodels low mass diffraction dissociation, where a rich resonance structure is\npresent, and thus predicts the differential and integrated cross sections in\nthe kinematical range appropriate to the LHC.We incorporate the physics of this\nmodel into the beam tracking code MERLIN and use it to simulate the resulting\nloss maps of the beam halo lost in the collimators in the LHC. \n\n"}

Owing to the fact that the scale-independent leptonic decay constant of\na scalar meson constituted from equal-mass valence-constituents vanishes, it is\nfound that the PDA of a given scalar system possesses one more zero than that\nof an analogous vector meson. Consequently, whereas the mean light-front\nrelative momentum of the valence-constituents within a vector meson is zero,\nthat within a scalar meson is large, an outcome which hints at a greater role\nfor light-front angular momentum in systems classified as $P$-wave in quantum\nmechanical models.

The counting rule was\ntheoretically predicted in perturbative QCD for hard exclusive hadron\nreactions, and it has been tested in experiments for stable hadrons including\ncompound systems of hadrons such as the deuteron, $^3$H, and $^3$He. It\nindicates that the cross section scales as $d\\sigma /dt \\sim 1/s^{n-2}$, where\n$s$ is the center-of-mass energy squared and $n$ is the total number of\nconstituents. We apply this method for finding internal configurations of\nexotic hadron candidates, especially $\\Lambda (1405)$. There is a possibility\nthat $\\Lambda (1405)$ could be five-quark state or a $\\bar K N$ molecule, and\nscaling properties should be different between the ordinary three-quark state\nor five-quark one.

Our hypothesis was based on\nexperimental data, which raised the idea of a finite formation time for the\nproduced medium. At RHIC energy and in low density corona region this time\nreaches about 2 fm/c. All observed high p_t particles are produced in the\ncorona region and have a chance to escape during this 2 fm/c. After that, the\nformed high density matter absorbs all jets. Following this hypothesis, the\nnuclear modification factor R_{AA} should be independent on particle momentum\nand be flat versus p_t. At the same time, we describe the finite azimuthal\nanisotropy of high p_t particles, v_2. A separate prediction held that, at LHC\nenergy, the formation time in the corona region should be two times smaller,\nabout 1 fm/c. New data at LHC show that R_{AA} is not flat and is rising with\np_t. We add to our original hypothesis an assumption that a fast parton\ntraversing the produced medium loses the fixed portion of its energy.

In this\npaper, we propose a three-dimensional envelope instability model to study the\ninstability for a bunched beam in a periodic solenoid and radio-frequency (RF)\nfocusing channel and a periodic quadrupole and RF focusing channel. This study\nshows that when the transverse zero current phase advance is below $90$\ndegrees, the beam envelope can still become unstable if the longitudinal zero\ncurrent phase advance is beyond $90$ degrees.

However, uncertainties in transport models (or model\ndependence) partly affect the reliability of the extracted result. In the\npresent work, by using the recently measured data of rapidity-dependent flows,\nwe constrain the incompressibility of nuclear matter and analyse the impact of\nmodel uncertainties on the obtained value. The method is based on the newly\nupdated version of the ultrarelativistic quantum molecular dynamics (UrQMD)\nmodel in which the Skyrme potential energy-density functional is introduced.\nThree different Skyrme interactions which give different incompressibilities\nvarying from $K_0$=201 to 271 MeV are adopted. The incompressibility is deduced\nfrom the comparison of the UrQMD model simulations and the FOPI data for\nrapidity-dependent elliptic flow in Au+Au collisions at beam energies\n0.4\\emph{A} - 1.0\\emph{A} GeV. The elliptic flow $v_2$ as a function of\nrapidity $y_0$ can be well described by a quadratic fit $v_2=v_{20} +\nv_{22}\\cdot y_0^2 $. It is found that the quantity $v_{2n}$ defined by\n$v_{2n}=|v_{20}|+|v_{22}|$ is quite sensitive to the incompressibility $K_0$\nand the in-medium nucleon-nucleon cross section, but not sensitive to the slope\nparameter $L$ of the nuclear symmetry energy.

This paper shows that the solenoid\nscan measurement overestimates the thermal emittance in the ordinary\nmeasurement configuration due to a weak quadrupole field (present in either the\nrf gun or gun solenoid) followed by a rotation in the solenoid. This coupled\ntransverse dynamics aberration introduces a correlation between the beam's\nhorizontal and vertical motion leading to an increase in the measured 2D\ntransverse emittance, thus the overestimation of the thermal emittance.

A\nmain prediction, in contrast with low-energy observations, is that the $pp$\nbreakup cross section is not much smaller than the one for $pn$ break up.In\nsome models, the energy-dependent oscillations observed for $pp$ scattering are\npredicted to appear in the $\\gamma ^3{\\rm He} \\to p p + n$ reaction. Such an\nobservation would open up a completely new field in studies of color coherence\nphenomena in hard nuclear reactions. We also demonstrate that, in addition to\nthe energy dependence, the measurement of the light-cone momentum distribution\nof the recoil neutron provides an independent test of the underlying dynamics\nof hard disintegration. \n\n"}

It is\ndemonstrated that MWNT can efficiently channel positively-charged high-energy\nparticles trapped between the walls of MWNT. Bending dechanneling in MWNT has\nbeen computed as a function of the particle momentum to nanotube curvature\nradius ratio, $pv/R$. It is found that a bent MWNT can steer a particle beam\nwith bending capabilities similar to those of bent silicon crystal lattice and\nto those of best (i.e. the narrowest) SWNT. In view of channeling applications\nat particle accelerators, MWNT appear favored as compared to SWNT, because MWNT\ncan be produced quite straight (and in aligned array), while SWNT is typically\nvery curved, thus posing a severe problem for channeling applications.\nTherefore, we suggest that MWNT provide a better candidate for channeling than\nSWNT. \n\n"}

We distinguish\naccordingly between the coherent and incoherent channels of the process.

The rate for the coherent channel in a laser\nfield of circular polarization is shown to be damped because of the destructive\ninterference of the partial waves that constitute the positronium ground-state\nwave packet.

Attaining the target sensitivity requires maintaining an electric field\nof several tens of kilovolts per centimeter across the experimental cell, which\nis nominally 7.5 cm wide and will contain about 4 liters of superfluid. The\nelectrical properties of liquid helium are expected to be sufficient to meet\nthe design goals, but little is known about these properties for volumes and\nelectrode spacings appropriate to the EDM experiment. Furthermore, direct\napplication of the necessary voltages from an external source to the\nexperimental test cell is impractical. An apparatus to amplify voltages in the\nliquid helium environment and to test the electrical properties of the liquid\nfor large volumes and electrode spacings has been constructed. The device\nconsists of a large-area parallel plate capacitor immersed in a 200 liter\nliquid helium dewar. Preliminary results show the breakdown strength of normal\nstate liquid helium is at least 90 kV/cm at these volumes, at the helium vapor\npressure corresponding to 4.38 K. These fields hold for more than 11 hours with\nleakage currents less than 170 pA (about 20% of the maximum tolerable in the\nEDM experiment). The system is also found to be robust against anticipated\nradiation backgrounds. Preliminary results for superfluid show that fields of\nat least 30 kV/cm can be sustained at the volumes required for the EDM\nexperiment, about 60% of the design goal. These results are likely limited by\nthe low pressure that must be maintained above the superfluid bath. \n\n"}

{"id": "physics/0610285", "contents": "Title: Ultimate parameters of the photon collider at the ILC Abstract: At linear colliders, the e+e- luminosity is limited by beam-collision\neffects, which determine the required emittances of beams in damping rings\n(DRs). While in gamma-gamma collisions at the photon collider, these effects\nare absent, and so smaller emittances are desirable. In present damping rings\ndesigns, nominal DR parameters correspond to those required for e+e-\ncollisions. In this note, I would like to stress once again that as soon as we\nplan the photon-collider mode of ILC operation, the damping-ring emittances are\ndictated by the photon-collider requirements--namely, they should be as small\nas possible. This can be achieved by adding more wigglers to the DRs; the\nincremental cost is easily justified by a considerable potential improvement of\nthe gamma-gamma luminosity. No expert analysis exists as of yet, but it seems\nrealistic to obtain a factor five increase of the gamma-gamma luminosity\ncompared to the ``nominal'' DR design. \n\n"}
