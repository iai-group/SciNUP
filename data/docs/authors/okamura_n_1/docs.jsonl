We find that in Calabi-Yau threefold\ncompactifications with logarithmic Kahler potentials K it appears to be\ndifficult to meet the conditions required for axion inflation in the\nsupergravity regime. However, in supergravities with an (approximately)\nquadratic shift-symmetric K, axion inflation may be viable. Such Kahler\npotentials do arise in some string models, in specific limits of the moduli\nspace. We describe the most promising classes of models; more detailed study\nwill be required before one can conclude that working models exist. \n\n"}

The periodicity with respect to L/E is broken by 2-3\noscillations which, in the case of the normal (inverted) hierarchy, shift the\nfirst 16 oscillations nearly 1% higher (lower) and move the next 16 lower\n(higher). The energy of each peak determines a particular combination of the\nmass differences, for example cos^2(theta12)Delta M^2_31 + sin^2(theta12)Delta\nM^2_32 for nearly all peaks visible at baselines under 40 km.

Abstract: The recent discovery of the putative 125-GeV Higgs boson has motivated a\nnumber of attempts to reconcile its relatively large mass with the predictions\nof the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM). Some approaches invoked\nlarge trilinear supersymmetry-breaking terms A_t between stops and one of the\nelementary Higgs fields. We consider the possibility that electroweak symmetry\nbreaking may be triggered by supersymmetry breaking with a large A_t, large\nenough to generate a composite field with the same quantum numbers as the Higgs\nboson and with a non-vanishing vacuum expectation value. In the resulting\nvacuum, the usual relation between the gauge couplings and the Higgs\nself-coupling does not apply, and there is no reason to expect the same upper\nbound on the mass of the lightest Higgs boson. In a simple model where the\nbound state is assumed to have no mixing with the other fields, we calculate\nthe critical coupling A_t necessary for symmetry breaking using the\nlowest-order Bethe-Salpeter (BS) equation. Study of the BS equation is\ncomplicated by the structure of its lowest-order kernel, which is a crossed box\ngraph, but we find an accurate approximation to its solution.

Recently, Majorana's\nspirit returns in modern condensed matter physics -- in the context of\ntopological Majorana zero modes in certain classes of topological\nsuperconductors(TSCs). In this paper, we attempt to investigate the topological\nnature of the neutrino by assuming that a relativistic Majorana fermion can be\ndivided into four topological Majorana zero modes at cutoff energy scale, e.g.\nplanck scale. We begin with an exactly solvable $1$D lattice model which\nrealizes a $T^2=-1$ time reversal symmetry protected TSC, and show that a pair\nof topological Majorana zero modes can realize a $T^4=-1$ time reversal\nsymmetry.Moreover, we find that a pair of topological Majorana zero modes can\nalso realize a $P^4=-1$ parity symmetry and even a nontrivial $\\overline\nC^4=-1$ charge conjugation symmetry. Next, we argue that the origin of three\ngenerations of neutrinos(charged leptons and quarks) can be naturally explained\nas three distinguishable ways of forming a pair of complex fermions(with\nopposite spin polarizations) out of four topological Majorana zero modes,\ncharacterized by the $T^4=-1$, $(TP)^4=-1$ and $(T \\overline C)^4=-1$\nfractionalized symmetries that each complex fermion carries at cutoff energy\nscale.

By analyzing\nthe phase space defined by the two angularities and using methods from\nsoft-collinear effective theory, we prove that the double differential cross\nsection factorizes at the boundaries of the phase space. We also show that the\ncross section in the bulk of the phase space cannot be factorized using only\nsoft and collinear modes, excluding the possibility of a global factorization\ntheorem in soft-collinear effective theory. Nevertheless, we are able to define\na simple interpolation procedure that smoothly connects the factorization\ntheorem at one boundary to the other.

We point\nout that there is an essential difference between the thermalization and\nformation of a condensate due to repulsive interactions, which can indeed drive\nlong-range order, and that due to attractive interactions, which can lead to\nlocalized Bose clumps (stars or solitons) that only exhibit short range\ncorrelation. While the difference between repulsion and attraction is not\npresent in the standard collisional Boltzmann equation, we argue that it is\nessential to the field theory dynamics, and we explain why the latter analysis\nis appropriate for a condensate. Since the axion is primarily governed by\nattractive interactions -- gravitation and scalar-scalar contact interactions\n-- we conclude that while a Bose-Einstein condensate is formed, the claim of\nlong-range correlation is unjustified. \n\n"}

We consider exclusive 2-jet\ncross sections in $e^+e^-$ collisions with an energy veto $\\Lambda$ on\nadditional jets. The key observation is that there are actually two pairs of\nenergy scales whose ratio is $R$: the transverse momentum $QR$ of the energetic\nparticles inside jets and their total energy $Q$, and the transverse momentum\n$\\Lambda R$ of soft particles that are cut out of the jet cones and their\nenergy $\\Lambda$.

This causes a\nlarge bulge in the propagator at small momentum. Mass is defined through\n$m^{-2}=\\Delta (p=0)$, where $\\Delta(p)$ is the scalar function for the gluon\npropagator in some chosen gauge, it is not a pole mass and is generally\ngauge-dependent, except in the gauge-invariant Pinch Technique (PT). We\ntruncate the PT equations with a new method called the vertex paradigm that\nautomatically satisfies the QED-like Ward identity relating the 3-gluon PT\nvertex function with the PT propagator. The mass is determined by a homogeneous\nBethe-Salpeter equation involving this vertex and propagator. This gap equation\nalso encapsulates the Bethe-Salpeter equation for the massless scalar\nexcitations, essentially Nambu-Goldstone fields, that necessarily accompany\ngauge-invariant gluon mass. The problem is to find a good approximate value for\n$m$ and at the same time explain the bulge, which by itself leads, in the gap\nequation for the gluon mass, to excessively large values for the mass.

In addition to the effect from QED, the effect also has a\npossibility to probe the dark sector. The effect predicted by QED is parity\nconservative, but the effect from the dark sector can induce parity violation.\nTo pursue this possibility, we calculated the effect from the dark sector with\nthe generalized Heisenberg-Euler effective Lagrangian that is applicable to\nparity-violating theories. Various dark sector models exist, among which the\ncontribution of the dark sector neutrinos to the VMB experiment is examined.\nThe contribution comes from the mixing of photon with the dark sector Z boson\nand violates parity, thus inducing a parity-violating electromagnetic\ninteraction. If the polarization vector is denoted by ${\\epsilon}(\\theta_i)$\nwhen its direction is rotated by an angle $\\theta_i$ from the direction of the\napplied magnetic field, the change of the polarization from\n${\\epsilon}(45^\\circ)$ to ${\\epsilon}(-45^\\circ)$ and vice versa are examined.\nThe contribution from the dark sector modifies the magnitude of the\npolarization change, so it can be detected by measuring the magnitude\nprecisely.

Caustics are places where the CDM\nparticles are naturally focussed. Our focus is upon the caustic rings which are\nclosed tubes whose cross-section is an elliptic umbilic catastrophe with three\ndual cusps. A caustic ring has a specific density profile, a specific geometry\nand, therefore, precisely calculable gravitational lensing signatures. The\nmagnification monotonically increases as the line of sight approaches to the\ncusps where it diverges in the limit of zero velocity dispersion. In this\nlimit, we find 37% magnification at a sample point near the outer cusps of the\nCDM caustic rings at cosmological distances. In the presence of finite velocity\ndispersion, the lower and upper bounds of the effective velocity dispersions of\nthe axion and WIMP flows in galactic halos may be used to constrain the lensing\neffects at the cusps. For a cosmological axion caustic ring, we find that the\nmagnification may range between 3% and 2800% at the outer cusp, and between 2%\nand 46% at the non-planer cusps. For a cosmological WIMP caustic ring, on the\nother hand, we constrain the magnification between 3% and 28% at the outer\ncusp, and between 2% and 5% at the non-planer cusps. The images of extended\nsources may also show distortions that can be unambiguously attributed to\nlensing by dark matter caustics.

A detailed report is given on the many experiments\nreporting evidence (or counter--evidence) for the $\\Theta^+(1540)$ and other\npentaquarks.

A Review Abstract: The real part of epsilon'/epsilon measures direct CP violation in the decays\nof the neutral kaons in two pions. It is a fundamental quantity which has\njustly attracted a great deal of theoretical as well as experimental work. Its\ndetermination may answer the question of whether CP violation is present only\nin the mass matrix of neutral kaons (the superweak scenario) or also at work\ndirectly in the decays. After a brief historical summary, we discuss the\npresent and expected experimental sensitivities. In the light of these, we come\nto the problem of estimating epsilon'/epsilon in the standard model. We review\nthe present (circa 1998) status of the theoretical predictions of\nepsilon'/epsilon. The short-distance part of the computation is now known to\nthe next-to-leading order in QCD and QED and therefore well under control. On\nthe other hand, the evaluation of the hadronic matrix element of the relevant\noperators is where most of the theoretical uncertainty still resides. We\nanalyze the results of the currently most developed calculations. The values of\nthe B_i parameters in the various approaches are discussed, together with the\nallowed range of the relevant combination of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa\nentries Im V_{td}V^*_{ts}. We conclude by summarizing and comparing all\nup-to-date predictions of epsilon'/epsilon. Because of the intrinsic\nuncertainties of the long-distance computations, values ranging from 10^{-4} to\na few times 10^{-3} can be accounted for in the standard model. Since this\nrange covers most of the present experimental uncertainty, it is unlikely that\nnew physics effects can be disentangled from the standard model prediction.

There are\nalso interesting experimental signals of these ideas: 1) Attractive or\nrepulsive, isotope dependent sub-millimeter forces $\\sim 10^6$ times\ngravitational strength, from the exchange of light bulk particles. 2) Novel\nHiggs decays to light generation fermions plus bulk scalars. 3) Collider\nproduction of bulk vector and scalar fields, leading to large $\\gamma$ or jet+\nmissing energy signals. \n\n"}

Abstract: We reconsider the possibility that the masses of the three light neutrinos of\nthe Standard Model might be almost degenerate and close to the present upper\nlimits from Tritium beta decay and cosmology. In such a scenario, the\ncancellations required by the latest upper limit on neutrinoless double-beta\ndecay enforce near-maximal mixing that may be compatible only with the\nvacuum-oscillation scenario for solar neutrinos. We argue that the mixing\nangles yielded by degenerate neutrino mass-matrix textures are not in general\nstable under small perturbations. We evaluate within the MSSM the\ngeneration-dependent one-loop renormalization of neutrino mass-matrix textures\nthat yielded degenerate masses and large mixing at the tree level. We find that\nm_{nu_e} > m_{nu_mu} > m_{nu_tau} after renormalization, excluding MSW effects\non solar neutrinos. We verify that bimaximal mixing is not stable, and show\nthat the renormalized masses and mixing angles are not compatible with all the\nexperimental constraints, even for tanbeta as low as unity.

The solution is based on a\nnonlinear generally covariant theory of a metastable graviton that leads to a\nlarge-distance modification of gravity.\n  From the extra-dimensional standpoint the problem is solved due to the fact\nthat the four-dimensional vacuum energy curves mostly the extra space. The\nfour-dimensional curvature is small, being inversely proportional to a positive\npower of the vacuum energy. The effects of infinite-volume extra dimensions are\nseen by a brane-world observer as nonlocal operators.\n  From the four-dimensional perspective the problem is solved because the\nzero-mode graviton is extremely weakly coupled to localized four-dimensional\nsources. The observable gravity is mediated not by zero mode but, instead, by a\nmetastable graviton with a lifetime of the order of the present-day Hubble\nscale. Therefore, laws of gravity are modified in the infrared above the Hubble\nscale.

Problem of interaction between\nthe associated soliton dyon solutions is investigated. For the case of\nlong-range interaction at first order by a small field of distant solitons we\nobtain that the generalized Lorentz force is acted on a dyon under\nconsideration. Short-range interaction between two dyons having identical\nelectric and opposite magnetic charges is investigated for an initial\napproximation. We consider the case when the velocities of the dyons have equal\nmodules and opposite directions on a common line. It is shown that the\nassociated field configuration has a constant full angular momentum which is\nindependent of the interdyonic distance and their speed. This property permits\na consideration of this bidyon configuration as an electromagnetic model of\ncharged particle with spin. We numerically investigate movement of the dyons in\nthis configuration for the case when the full electric charge equals the\nelectron charge and the full angular momentum equals the electron spin. It is\nshown that for this case the absolute value of relation between electric and\nmagnetic charges of the dyons equals the fine structure constant. The\ncalculation gives that the bidyon may behave as nonlinear oscillator.\nAssociated dependence of frequency on the full energy is obtained for the\ninitial approximation. In the limits of the electrodynamic model we obtain that\nthe quick-oscillating wave packet may behave like massive gravitating particle\nwhen it move in high background field. We discuss the possible electrodynamic\nworld with the oscillating bidyons as particles. \n\n"}

The existing data at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS)\nenergies are shown to be consistent with the picture of Glauber multiple\nscattering in which the interplay between soft and hard processes and the\neffect of absorptive processes lead to nontrivial nuclear modification of the\nparticle spectra. Relative to the additive model of incoherent hard scattering,\nthe spectra are enhanced at large $p_T$ (hard) by multiple scattering while\nsuppressed at low $p_T$ (soft) by absorptive correction with the transition\noccurring at around a scale $p_0\\sim 1-2$ GeV/$c$ that separates soft and hard\nprocesses. Around the same scale, the $p_T$ spectra in $pp$ collisions also\nchange from an exponential form at low $p_T$ to a power-law behavior at high\n$p_T$. At very large $p_T\\gg p_0$, the nuclear enhancement is shown to decrease\nlike $1/p_T^2$.
