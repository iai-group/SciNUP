Typically a wall will prefer\none of the phases, and hence the composition of the system in the direction\nperpendicular to the walls will not be homogeneous. If both walls are of the\nsame kind, this effect leads to a distortion of the phase diagram of the system\nin thin film geometry, in comparison with the bulk, analogous to the phenomenon\nof \"capillary condensation\" of simple fluids in thin capillaries. In the case\nof \"competing walls\", where both walls prefer different phases of the two\nphases coexisting in the bulk, a state with an interface parallel to the walls\ngets stabilized.

Edges may be\nweighted if the interaction strength is measurable. However, the full network\ninformation is often redundant because tools and techniques from network\nanalysis do not work or become very inefficient if the network is too dense and\nsome weights may just reflect measurement errors, and shall be discarded.\nMoreover, since weight distributions in many complex weighted networks are\nbroad, most of the weight is concentrated among a small fraction of all edges.\nIt is then crucial to properly detect relevant edges. Simple thresholding would\nleave only the largest weights, disrupting the multiscale structure of the\nsystem, which is at the basis of the structure of complex networks, and ought\nto be kept. In this paper we propose a weight filtering technique based on a\nglobal null model (GloSS filter), keeping both the weight distribution and the\nfull topological structure of the network.

Despite the importance of this quantity in classifying liquids,\nexplaining what aspects of the microscopic structure controls fragility remains\na challenge. Surprisingly, experiments indicate that the linear elasticity of\nthe glass -- a purely local property of the free energy landscape -- is a good\npredictor of fragility. In particular, materials presenting a large excess of\nsoft elastic modes, the so-called boson peak, are strong. This is also the case\nfor network liquids near the rigidity percolation, known to affect elasticity.\nHere we introduce a model of the glass transition based on the assumption that\nparticles can organize locally into distinct configurations, which are coupled\nspatially via elasticity. The model captures the mentioned observations\nconnecting elasticity and fragility. We find that materials presenting an\nabundance of soft elastic modes have little elastic frustration: energy is\ninsensitive to most directions in phase space, leading to a small jump of\nspecific heat. In this framework strong liquids turn out to lie the closest to\na critical point associated with a rigidity or jamming transition, and their\nthermodynamic properties are related to the problem of number partitioning and\nto Hopfield nets in the limit of small memory. \n\n"}

We begin\nwith the perfect vibrational system, which provides precise definitions of the\nliquid correlations, and provides the vibrational approximation Fdvib(q,t) at\nall q and t. Two independent liquid correlations are defined, motional and\nstructural, and these are decorrelated sequentially, with a crossover time\ntc(q). This is done by two independent decorrelation processes: the first,\nvibrational dephasing, is naturally present in Fdvib(q,t) and operates to damp\nthe motional correlation; the second, transit-induced decorrelation, is invoked\nto enhance the damping of motional correlation, and then to damp the structural\ncorrelation.

We are particularly\nconcerned by the time between these extreme events, called respectively waiting\ntime and quiet time. If the thresholds are high enough it is possible to\njustify the existence of scaling laws for the probability distribution of the\ntimes as a function of the threshold value, although the scaling functions are\ndifferent in each case. For point processes, in addition to the trivial Poisson\nprocess, one can obtain double-power-law distributions with no finite mean\nvalue. This is justified in the context of renormalization-group\ntransformations, where such distributions arise as limiting distributions after\niterations of the transformation. Clear connections with the generalized\ncentral limit theorem are established from here. The non-existence of finite\nmoments leads to a semi-parametric scaling law in terms of the sample mean\nwaiting time, in which the (usually unkown) scale parameter is eliminated but\nnot the exponents. In the case of time series, scaling can arise by considering\nrandom-walk-like signals with absorbing boundaries, resulting in distributions\nwith a power-law \"bulk\" and a faster decay for long times. For large thresholds\nthe moments of the quiet-time distribution show a power-law dependence with the\nscale parameter, and isolation of the latter and of the exponents leads to a\nnon-parametric scaling law in terms only of the moments of the distribution.\nConclusions about the projections of changes in the occurrence of natural\nhazards lead to the necessity of distinguishing the behavior of the mean of the\ndistribution with the behavior of the extreme events. \n\n"}

Such a path usually requires laborious fabrication\ntechniques, especially when a specific funcionalisation of the building blocks\nis required. Telechelic star polymers, i.e., star polymers made of a number $f$\nof di-block copolymers consisting of solvophobic and solvophilic monomers\ngrafted on a central anchoring point, spontaneously self-assemble into soft\npatchy particles featuring attractive spots (patches) on the surface.

For example, the game Pok\\'emon GO spread rapidly because of\nthe aroused curiosity among users. This paper proposes an information\npropagation model considering the curiosity level of each individual, which is\na dynamical parameter that evolves over time. We evaluate the efficiency of our\nmodel in contrast to traditional information propagation models, like SIR or\nIC, and perform analysis on different types of artificial and real-world\nnetworks, like Google+, Facebook, and the United States roads map.

Most of these are\neffectively \"fabric evolution models\" (FEMs) based on a stress rule connecting\nthe bulk stress to a rank-2 microstructural fabric tensor Q and a closed\ntime-evolution equation for Q. In dense suspensions most of the stress comes\nfrom short-ranged pairwise steric or lubrication interactions at near-contacts,\nso a natural choice for Q is the deviatoric 2nd moment of the distribution P(p)\nof the near-contact orientations p. Here we test directly whether a closed\ntime-evolution equation for such a Q can exist for inertialess non-Brownian\nhard spheres in a Newtonian solvent. We perform extensive numerical simulations\nfor the evolution of P(p) under shear reversal, providing a stringent test for\nFEMs. We consider a generic class of these as defined by Hand (1962)\nconstrained only by frame indifference. Motivated by the small microstructural\nanisotropy in the dense regime, we start with linear models and successively\nconsider increasingly nonlinear ones. Based on these results we suggest that no\nclosed FEM properly describes the dynamics of Q under reversal. We attribute\nthis to the fact that Q gives a poor description of the microstructure during\nlarge parts of the microstructural evolution following shear reversal.\nSpecifically, the truncation of P(p) at 2nd spherical harmonic level describes\ntwo-lobed distributions of near-contact orientations, whereas on reversal we\nobserve distributions that are markedly four-lobed; moreover dP/dt (p) has\noblique axes, not collinear with those of Q in the shear plane. This structure\nlikely precludes any adequate closure at second-rank level.

How\nneuronal systems give rise to invariant object classification and recognition\nis a fundamental problem in brain theory as well as in machine learning. Here\nwe study the ability of a readout network to classify objects from their\nperceptual manifold representations. We develop a statistical mechanical theory\nfor the linear classification of manifolds with arbitrary geometry revealing a\nremarkable relation to the mathematics of conic decomposition. Novel\ngeometrical measures of manifold radius and manifold dimension are introduced\nwhich can explain the classification capacity for manifolds of various\ngeometries. The general theory is demonstrated on a number of representative\nmanifolds, including L2 ellipsoids prototypical of strictly convex manifolds,\nL1 balls representing polytopes consisting of finite sample points, and\norientation manifolds which arise from neurons tuned to respond to a continuous\nangle variable, such as object orientation.

This\ntype of disorder, unlike non-homogeneous magnetic field, is non-hermitian, and\ncan lead to the emergence of a complex relaxation spectrum. It is therefore\ndramatically distinct from the conservative Anderson-type or Sinai-type\ndisorder. We discuss the consequences of having TSD. In particular we\nilluminate 3~different routes to under-damped relaxation, and show that\nlocalization plays a major role in the analysis.

By reverting to an older,\nmore heuristic model it is shown that all of the technical difficulties are\neliminated. Application to a Lennard-Jones fluid results in a demonstration of\npower of ftDFT to describe crystallization in a highly inhomogeneous system.\nFirst, we show that droplets attached to a slightly hydrophobic wall\ncrystallize spontaneously upon being quenched. The resulting crystallites are\nclearly faceted structures and are predominantly HCP structures.

In\ncontrast, local projective measurements disentangle degrees of freedom and\ndecrease entanglement. We study the interplay of these competing tendencies by\nconsidering time evolution combining both unitary and projective dynamics. We\nbegin by constructing a toy model of Bell pair dynamics which demonstrates that\nmeasurements can keep a system in a state of low (i.e. area law) entanglement,\nin contrast with the volume law entanglement produced by generic pure unitary\ntime evolution. While the simplest Bell pair model has area law entanglement\nfor any measurement rate, as seen in certain non-interacting systems, we show\nthat more generic models of entanglement can feature an area-to-volume law\ntransition at a critical value of the measurement rate, in agreement with\nrecent numerical investigations. As a concrete example of these ideas, we\nanalytically investigate Clifford evolution in qubit systems which can exhibit\nan entanglement transition. We are able to identify stabilizer size\ndistributions characterizing the area law, volume law and critical 'fixed\npoints.' We also discuss Floquet random circuits, where the answers depend on\nthe order of limits - one order of limits yields area law entanglement for any\nnon-zero measurement rate, whereas a different order of limits allows for an\narea law - volume law transition. Finally, we provide a rigorous argument that\na system subjected to projective measurements can only exhibit a volume law\nentanglement entropy if it also features a subleading correction term, which\nprovides a universal signature of projective dynamics in the high-entanglement\nphase.

The former occurs for $p$ smaller than a critical rate $p_c$,\nand is characterized by volume-law entanglement in the steady-state and\n`ballistic' entanglement growth after a quench. By contrast, for $p > p_c$ the\nsystem can sustain only area-law entanglement. At $p = p_c$ the steady state is\nscale-invariant and, in 1+1D, the entanglement grows logarithmically after a\nquench.\n  To obtain a simple heuristic picture for the entangling-disentangling\ntransition, we first construct a toy model that describes the zeroth R\\'{e}nyi\nentropy in discrete time. We solve this model exactly by mapping it to an\noptimization problem in classical percolation.\n  The generic entangling-disentangling transition can be diagnosed using the\nvon Neumann entropy and higher R\\'{e}nyi entropies, and it shares many\nqualitative features with the toy problem.

The initial ensembles of pores are comprised of multiple pores with\nsmall sizes, which are approximately normally distributed. As periodic loading\nproceeds, the ensembles evolve into configurations with a few large-scale pores\nand significantly reduced number of small pores. These structural changes are\nreflected in the skewed shapes of the pore-size distribution functions and the\nappearance of a distinct peak at large length scales after hundreds of shear\ncycles. Moreover, periodic shear causes substantial densification of solid\ndomains in the porous systems.

This results in a MD or MFP\nmodel scenario that discriminates between cases in which polls are reliable and\nnot reliable, respectively. More precisely, predictions based on polls should\nbe avoided whenever the data maps to a MFP because anomalous large fluctuations\n(if $q=2$) or sudden jumps (if $q\\geq 3$) in the trends might take place as a\nresult of a second-order or a first-order phase transition of the MFP,\nrespectively. \n\n"}

We\nassume that, first, the growth of the car cluster is governed by attachment of\ncars to the cluster whose rate is mainly determined by the mean headway\ndistance between the car in the vehicle flow and, may be, also by the headway\ndistance in the cluster. Second, the cluster dissolution is determined by the\ncar escape from the cluster whose rate depends on the cluster size directly.\nThe latter is justified using the available experimental data for the\ncorrelation properties of the synchronized mode.

Abstract: The glass transition of supercooled fluids is a particular challenge for\ncomputer simulation, because the (longest) relaxation times increase by about\n15 decades upon approaching the transition temperature T_g.

Hence this allows to\naccess the temperature range around T_c of the so-called mode coupling theory,\nwhereas the dynamics around the experimental glass transition is completely out\nof reach. While methods such as ``parallel tempering'' improve the situation\nsomewhat, a method that allows to span a significant part of the region T_g\\leq\nT\\leq T_c is still lacking. Only for abstract models such as the infinite range\n10-state Potts glass with a few hundred spins this region can be explored.\nHowever this model suffers from very strong finite size effects thus making it\ndifficult to extrapolate the results obtained for the finite system sizes to\nthe thermodynamic limit. For the case of polymer melts, two different\nstrategies to use lattice models instead of continuum models are discussed: In\nthe first approach, a mapping of an atomistically realistic model of\npolyethylene to the bond fluctuation model with suitable effective potentials\nand a temperature-dependent time rescaling factor is attempted. In the second\napproach, devoted to a test of the entropy theory, moves that are artificial\nbut which lead to a faster relaxation (``slithering snake'' algorithm) are\nused, to get at least static properties at somewhat lower temperatures than\npossible with a ``realistic'' dynamics.

This attractive interaction becomes\nstronger as the threshold energy of the Feshbach resonance two-particle bound\nstate is lowered. In a recent paper, we showed that in the uniform Fermi gas,\nthis tunable pairing interaction naturally leads to a BCS-BEC crossover of the\nNozi`eres and Schmitt-Rink kind, in which the BCS-type superfluid phase\ntransition continuously changes into the BEC-type as the threshold energy is\ndecreased.

In the first model a \\pm\nJ-distribution of the bonds is chosen, in the second model a Gaussian\ndistribution. In both cases the first two moments of the distribution are\nchosen to be J_0=-1, Delta J=+1, so that no ferromagnetic ordering of the Potts\nspins can occur. We find that for all temperatures investigated the spin glass\nsusceptibility remains finite, the spin glass order parameter remains zero, and\nthat the specific heat has only a smooth Schottky-like peak. These results can\nbe understood quantitatively by considering small but independent clusters of\nspins. Hence we have evidence that there is no static phase transition at any\nnonzero temperature. Consistent with these findings, only very minor size\neffects are observed, which implies that all correlation lengths of the models\nremain very short. We also compute for both models the time auto-correlation\nfunction C(t) of the Potts spins. While in the Gaussian model C(t) shows a\nsmooth uniform decay, the correlator for the \\pm J model has several distinct\nsteps.

In here the approximation used by\nBogolyubov to study weakly non-ideal Bose gas, to be refereed to as weakly\nnon-ideal Bose gas approximation (WBGA), is applied in the analysis of of the\nthree reaction-diffusion models (i) A+A->0, (ii) A+B->0 and (iii)\nA+A,B+B,A+B->0 (the ABBA model). The two types of WBGA are considered, the\nsimpler WBGA-I and more complicated WBGA-II. All models are defined on the\nlattice to facilitate comparison with computer experiment (simulation). It is\nfound that the WBGA describes A+B reaction well, it reproduces correct d/4\ndensity decay exponent. However, it fails in the case of the A+A reaction and\nthe ABBA model.

Invoking\nthe concept of marginal stability, this theory links irreversible\n`intermittent' events, or `quakes' to thermal fluctuations of record magnitude.\nThe pivotal idea is that the largest energy barrier $b(t_w,T)$ surmounted prior\nto $t_w$ by thermal fluctuations at temperature $T$ determines the rate $r_q\n\\propto 1/t_w$ of the intermittent events occurring near $t_w$. The idea leads\nto a rate of intermittent events after a negative temperature shift given by\n$r_q \\propto 1/t_w^{eff}$, where the `effective age' $t_w^{eff} \\geq t_w$ has\nan algebraic dependence on $t_w$, whose exponent contains the temperatures\nbefore and after the shift.

The basic assumption is that the {\\it\ncomputational} system dynamics can be decomposed into two parts -- fast (noise)\nand slow (reaction coordinates) dynamics, so that the system can be described\nby an effective, coarse grained Fokker-Planck (FP) equation. While such an\nassumption may be valid in many circumstances, an explicit form of FP equation\nis not always available. In our computations we bypass the analytic derivation\nof such an effective FP equation. The effective free energy gradient and the\nstate-dependent magnitude of the random noise, which are necessary to formulate\nthe effective Fokker-Planck equation, are obtained from ensembles of short\nbursts of microscopic simulations {\\it with judiciously chosen initial\nconditions}.

This fragility is due to the presence of at least one marginal\nmode in the Hessian of the free energy, that makes the states highly\nsusceptible under external perturbations. The cavity method is a technique that\nrecursively describes the property of a system with N+1 spins in terms of those\nof a system with N spins. To do so, the cavity method assumes a certain degree\nof stability when adding a new spin to the system, i.e. it assumes that for a\ngeneric choice of the parameters there is an one-to-one correspondence between\nthe metastable states of the system with N spins and the metastable states of\nthe system with N+1 spins. In systems where the supersymmetry is broken such a\ncorrespondence does not exist, and an alternative formulation of the cavity\nmethod must be devised.

Close to the walls the system reaches a lamellar order with very\nfew defects and the slope of the horizontal velocity is higher than the imposed\nshear rate. In the middle of the system the local shear rate is lower than the\nimposed one and the system looks as a mixture of tilted lamellae, droplets and\nsmall elongated domains.

{"id": "gr-qc/0101116", "contents": "Title: Eliminating Thermal Violin Spikes from LIGO Noise Abstract: We have developed a scheme for reducing LIGO suspension thermal noise close\nto violin-mode resonances. The idea is to monitor directly the\nthermally-induced motion of a small portion of (a ``point'' on) each suspension\nfiber, thereby recording the random forces driving the test-mass motion close\nto each violin-mode frequency. One can then suppress the thermal noise by\noptimally subtracting the recorded fiber motions from the measured motion of\nthe test mass, i.e., from the LIGO output. The proposed method is a\nmodification of an analogous but more technically difficult scheme by\nBraginsky, Levin and Vyatchanin for reducing broad-band suspension thermal\nnoise. The efficiency of our method is limited by the sensitivity of the sensor\nused to monitor the fiber motion. If the sensor has no intrinsic noise (i.e.\nhas unlimited sensitivity), then our method allows, in principle, a complete\nremoval of violin spikes from the thermal-noise spectrum. We find that in\nLIGO-II interferometers, in order to suppress violin spikes below the\nshot-noise level, the intrinsic noise of the sensor must be less than\n\\~2*10^{-13}cm/sqrt(Hz). This sensitivity is two orders of magnitude greater\nthan that of currently available sensors. \n\n"}

Namely, in addition to the\nstochastic guidance condition which describes how the wave controls the\nparticle (wave-to-particle guidance condition), we introduce another stochastic\nguidance condition describing how the particle guides the wave\n(particle-to-wave guidance condition). We therefore introduce an\naction-reaction principle in the pilot-wave formulation of quantum mechanics.\nThe particle-to-wave guidance condition takes the form of spontaneous\ntransitions of the wavefunction that are Poisson distributed in time. The\nwavefunction selected by the transition is influenced by its likelyhood with\nrespect to the particle position, as well as certain conservation constraints.\nIt is shown that the stochastic particle-to-wave guidance condition reproduces\ncertain aspects of the spontaneous localization model of Ghirardi, Rimini and\nWeber [G.
