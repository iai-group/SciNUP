Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on\nthe role that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in\nglobular clusters, e.g., influencing the distribution of horizontal branch\nstars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of some globular clusters, and in\nforming low mass white dwarfs. \n\n"}

Our approach\ncontains one free parameter, the lifetime of a protostellar object t_yso (Class\n0 + Class I stages), which is outside the realm of the simulations. Assuming a\nvalue t_yso = 0.46 Myr, we obtain number ratios of starless to stellar cores\nranging from 4-5 at n_thr = 1.5 x 10^4 cm^-3 to 1 at n_thr = 1.2 x 10^5 cm^-3,\nagain in good agreement with observational determinations.

The\nintracluster helium abundance cannot be measured directly.

Transient Be/X-ray binaries exhibit two branches in their colour-colour\nand colour-intensity diagrams: the horizontal branch corresponds to a\nlow-intensity state and shows the larger fractional rms, similar to the the\nisland state in atolls and horizontal branch in Z sources; the diagonal branch\ncorresponds to a high-intensity state, in which the source spends about 75% of\nthe total duration of the outburst.

Our simulations have high resolution in mass and\nspace which, for the first time, makes it feasible to follow the orbital decay\nof a MBH either counter- or co-rotating with respect to the circumnuclear disc.\nWe show that a moving MBH on an initially counter-rotating orbit experiences an\n\"orbital angular momentum flip\" due to the gas-dynamical friction, i.e., it\nstarts to corotate with the disc before a MBH binary forms. We stress that this\neffect can only be captured in very high resolution simulations.

In the accretion model the secondary star accretes mass\nfrom the primary wind near periastron passage, a process that suppresses the\nsecondary wind. As the shocked secondary wind is responsible for most of the\nX-ray emission, the accretion process accounts for the X-ray minimum. The early\nexit from the 2009 X-ray minimum after four weeks, instead of ten weeks as in\nthe two previous minima, is attributed to the primary wind that during the last\nminimum was somewhat faster and of lower mass loss rate than during the two\nprevious X-ray minima. This results in a much lower mass accretion rate during\nthe X-ray minimum. We show that using fluctuations in these quantities that are\nwithin the range deduced from fluctuations in the X-ray flux outside the\nminimum, can account for the short duration of the last X-ray minimum.

We discuss the possibility and theoretical aspects\nof using Lyman alpha emission properties of long GRB host galaxies as a\nmetallicity indicator of high redshift GRB environments, where direct\nmetallicity measurements are not easy. We propose to use the fraction of\nLy-alpha emitters (LAEs) in long GRB host galaxies as a function of UV\nluminosity, which can be compared with star-formation-rate weighted LAE\nfraction of Lyman-break galaxies as the standard in the case of no metallicity\ndependence. There are two important effects of metallicity dependence of long\nGRB rate to change the LAE fraction of host galaxies. One is the enhancement of\nintrinsic Ly-alpha equivalent width (EW) by stronger ionizing UV luminosity of\nlow metallicity stellar population, and the other is extinction by interstellar\ndust to change the observable EW. Based on a latest theoretical model of LAEs\nthat reproduce observations, we argue that the latter is likely to work in the\nopposite direction to the former, i.e., to decrease LAE fraction if GRBs\npreferentially occur in low-metallicity environments, because of the clumpy\ninter-stellar medium effect.

If this is interpreted as an age\nspread, the multiple populations are separated by a few hundred Myr, which\nwould call into question the long held notion that clusters are simple stellar\npopulations. Here we show that stellar rotation in stars with masses between\n1.2-1.7 Msun can mimic the effect of a double or multiple population, whereas\nin actuality only a single population exists. The two main causes of the spread\nnear the turn-off are the effects of stellar rotation on the structure of the\nstar and the inclination angle of the star relative to the observer. Both\neffects change the observed effective temperature, hence colour, and flux of\nthe star.

This will allow the detection of gravitational waves\ngenerated in binary systems containing black holes of intermediate mass, ~\n100-1000 solar masses.

However,\nunlike in other models, each process is assumed to have an efficiency which\ndepends only on the host halo mass and redshift. This allows us to describe the\nvarious components of the model in a simple and transparent way. By allowing\nthe efficiencies to have any value for a given halo mass and redshift, we can\neasily encompass a large range of scenarios. To demonstrate this point, we\nexamine several different galaxy formation models, which are all consistent\nwith the observational data. Each model is characterized by a different unique\nfeature: cold accretion in low mass haloes, zero feedback, stars formed only in\nmerger-induced bursts, and shutdown of star-formation after mergers.

Under reasonable\nassumptions that both BLRs are illuminated by the two active SMBHs and that the\nionizing flux at the BLR location is roughly constant, we confirm the emergence\nof double-peaked features and radial velocity drifts of the two peaks due to\nthe binary orbital motion. However, such a clear double-peaked feature only\narises in a particular stage of the binary evolution when the two BHs are close\nenough such that the line-of-sight orbital velocity difference is larger than\nthe FWHM of the individual broad components, while the two BLRs are still\nmostly distinct. Prior to this stage, the velocity splitting due to the orbit\nmotion of the binary is too small to separate the emission from the two BLRs,\nleading to asymmetric broad line profiles in general. When the two BHs are even\ncloser such that the two BLRs can no longer be distinct, the line profile\nbecomes more complex and the splitting of the peaks does not correspond to the\norbital motion of the binary. In this regime there are no coherent radial\nvelocity drifts in the peaks with time.

The dissipationless\nremnants are typically prolate-triaxial, dominated by box orbits within r_c ~\n1.5Reff, and by tube orbits in their outer parts. As the gas fraction\nincreases, the box orbits within r_c are increasingly replaced by a population\nof short axis tubes (z-tubes) with near zero net rotation, and the remnants\nbecome progressively more oblate and round. The long axis tube (x-tube) orbits\nare highly streaming and relatively insensitive to the gas fraction, implying\nthat their angular momentum is retained from the dynamically cold initial\nconditions.

The Fermi telescope provides a new opportunity to test particle\ndark matter models through the expected gamma-ray emission produced by pair\nannihilation of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). Local Group dwarf\nspheroidal galaxies, the largest galactic substructures predicted by the cold\ndark matter scenario, are attractive targets for such indirect searches for\ndark matter because they are nearby and among the most extreme dark matter\ndominated environments.

As a result, the surface temperature of the star can become\nsignificantly higher than it is in the normal state resulting from\nthermonuclear burning.

The galaxy is detected in the Lyman-alpha, [OIII]\nlambda4959,5007 Halpha emission lines at an impact parameter of about 0.8\narcsec (6 kpc at z_abs = 2.354).

Two widely discussed models are monolithic collapse of\nmolecular cloud cores and competitive accretion. To learn more about massive\nstar formation, we perform simulations of the collapse of rotating, massive,\ncloud cores including radiative heating by both non-ionizing and ionizing\nradiation using the FLASH adaptive mesh refinement code. These simulations show\nfragmentation from gravitational instability in the enormously dense accretion\nflows required to build up massive stars. Secondary stars form rapidly in these\nflows and accrete mass that would have otherwise been consumed by the massive\nstar in the center, in a process that we term fragmentation-induced starvation.\nThis explains why massive stars are usually found as members of high-order\nstellar systems that themselves belong to large clusters containing stars of\nall masses. The radiative heating does not prevent fragmentation, but does lead\nto a higher Jeans mass, resulting in fewer and more massive stars than would\nform without the heating. This mechanism reproduces the observed relation\nbetween the total stellar mass in the cluster and the mass of the largest star.\nIt predicts strong clumping and filamentary structure in the center of\ncollapsing cores, as has recently been observed. We speculate that a similar\nmechanism will act during primordial star formation. \n\n"}

Previous attempts to\nmeasure such deficits depended on fitting some functional form to the profile\nat large radii and extrapolating inwards; this is sensitive to the assumed\nfunctional form and does not allow for variation in nuclear profile shapes. We\ntake advantage of larger data sets to directly construct stellar mass profiles\nof observed systems and measure the stellar mass enclosed in a series of\nphysical radii (M(<R)), for samples of cusp and core spheroids at the same\nstellar mass. There is a significant bimodality in this distribution at small\nradii, and we non-parametrically measure the median offset between core and\ncusp populations (the deficit Delta_M(<R)). We construct the scoured mass\nprofile as a function of radius, without reference to any assumed functional\nform. The mass deficit rises in power-law fashion (Delta_M(<R) R^{1.3-1.8})\nfrom a significant but small mass at R<10pc, to asymptote to a maximum ~0.5-2\nM_BH at ~100pc. At larger radii there is no statistically significant\nseparation between populations; the upper limit to the cumulative scoured mass\nat ~kpc is ~2-4 M_BH. This does not depend strongly on stellar mass. The\ndispersion in M(<R) appears larger in the core population, possibly reflecting\nthe fact that scouring increases the scatter in profile shapes.

The model explaining this\nnew behavior of flare activity could be consistent with adiabatically cooling\nplasma blobs that are expanding but also partially eclipsing the background\nquiescent emission from Sgr A*. When a flare is launched, the plasma blob is\nmost compact and is brightest in the optically thin regime whereas the emission\nin radio/submm wavelengths has a higher opacity. Absorption in the observed\nlight curve of Sgr A* at radio/submm flux is due to the combined effects of\nlower brightness temperature of plasma blobs with respect to the quiescent\nbrightness temperature and high opacity of plasma blobs. This implies that\nplasma blobs are mainly placed in the magnetosphere of a disk-like flow or\nfurther out in the flow.

This quantity, in case of no extra degrees of\nfreedom, depends upon the chemical potential and the temperature characterizing\nthe three active neutrino distributions, as well as by their possible\nnon-thermal features. In the present analysis we determine the upper bounds\nthat BBN places on N_eff from primordial neutrino--antineutrino asymmetries,\nwith a careful treatment of the dynamics of neutrino oscillations. We consider\nquite a wide range for the total lepton number in the neutrino sector, eta_nu=\neta_{nu_e}+eta_{nu_mu}+eta_{nu_tau} and the initial electron neutrino asymmetry\neta_{nu_e}^in, solving the corresponding kinetic equations which rule the\ndynamics of neutrino (antineutrino) distributions in phase space due to\ncollisions, pair processes and flavor oscillations. New bounds on both the\ntotal lepton number in the neutrino sector and the nu_e -bar{nu}_e asymmetry at\nthe onset of BBN are obtained fully exploiting the time evolution of neutrino\ndistributions, as well as the most recent determinations of primordial 2H/H\ndensity ratio and 4He mass fraction. Note that taking the baryon fraction as\nmeasured by WMAP, the 2H/H abundance plays a relevant role in constraining the\nallowed regions in the eta_nu -eta_{nu_e}^in plane. These bounds fix the\nmaximum contribution of neutrinos with primordial asymmetries to N_eff as a\nfunction of the mixing parameter theta_13, and point out the upper bound N_eff\n< 3.4.

We trace its\ninfluence from interstellar cloud scales down to star-disk scales. On both\nscales, we find that magnetic diffusion can be significantly enhanced by the\nbuildup of strong gradients in magnetic field structure. Large scale nonlinear\nflows can create compressed cloud layers within which ambipolar diffusion\noccurs rapidly. However, in the flux-freezing limit that may be applicable to\nphotoionized molecular cloud envelopes, supersonic motions can persist for long\ntimes if driven by an externally generated magnetic field that corresponds to a\nsubcritical mass-to-flux ratio. In the case of protostellar accretion, rapid\nmagnetic diffusion (through Ohmic dissipation with additional support from\nambipolar diffusion) near the protostar causes dramatic magnetic flux loss.

Because of its\nfragility Li is destroyed at the temperature at which the CNO cycling occurs,\nand this makes Li a crucial study for the nature of the contaminating stars. We\nobserved 112 un-evolved stars at the Turnoff of the NGC6752 cluster with FLAMES\nat the VLT to investigate the presence and the extent of a Li-O correlation.\nThis correlation is expected if there is a simple pollution scenario. Li (670.8\nnm) and O triplet (771 nm) abundances are derived in NLTE. All stars belong to\na very narrow region of the color-magnitude diagram, so they have similar\nstellar parameters (Teff, log g). We find that O and Li correlate, with a high\nstatistical significance that confirms the early results for this cluster. At\nfirst glance this is what is expected if a simple pollution of pristine gas\nwith CNO cycled gas (O-poor, Li-poor) occurred. The slope of the relationship,\nhowever, is about 0.4, and differs from unity by over 7 Sigma. A slope of one\nis the value predicted for a pure contamination model. We confirm an extended\nLi-O correlation in non evolved stars of NGC 6752.

We present a new\nanalytical estimate of the range of possible fluctuations in the high energy\nelectron flux due to the discreteness of plausible cosmic ray sources.

In this paper, the first in a series, we present and test a novel\nnumerical implementation of stellar feedback resulting from momentum imparted\nto the ISM by radiation, supernovae, and stellar winds. We employ a realistic\ncooling function, and find that a large fraction of the gas cools to <100K, so\nthat the ISM becomes highly inhomogeneous. Despite this, our simulated galaxies\nreach an approximate steady state, in which gas gravitationally collapses to\nform giant molecular clouds (GMCs), dense clumps, and stars; subsequently,\nstellar feedback disperses the GMCs, repopulating the diffuse ISM. This\ncollapse and dispersal cycle is seen in models of SMC-like dwarfs, the\nMilky-Way, and z~2 clumpy disk analogues. The simulated global star formation\nefficiencies are consistent with the observed Kennicutt-Schmidt relation.\nMoreover, the star formation rates are nearly independent of the numerically\nimposed high-density star formation efficiency, density threshold, and density\nscaling. This is a consequence of the fact that, in our simulations, star\nformation is regulated by stellar feedback limiting the amount of very dense\ngas available for forming stars. In contrast, in simulations without stellar\nfeedback, i.e. under the action of only gravity and gravitationally-induced\nturbulence, the ISM experiences runaway collapse to very high densities.

We present the\nresults of a SN survey in the Subaru Deep Field (SDF). Over a period of 3\nyears, we have observed the SDF on 4 independent epochs with Suprime-Cam on the\nSubaru 8.2-m telescope, with 2 nights of exposure per epoch, in the R, i', and\nz' bands. We have discovered 150 SNe out to redshift z~2. Using 11 photometric\nbands from the observer-frame far-ultraviolet to the near-infrared, we derive\nphotometric redshifts for the SN host galaxies (for 24 we also have\nspectroscopic redshifts). This information is combined with the SN photometry\nto determine the type and redshift distribution of the SN sample. Our final\nsample includes 28 SNe Ia in the range 1.0<z<1.5 and 10 in the range 1.5<z<2.0.\nOur SN Ia rate measurements are consistent with those derived from the\nHST/GOODS sample, but the overall uncertainty of our 1.5<z<2.0 measurement is a\nfactor of 2 smaller, of 35-50%. We find that the SN Ia rate evolution levels\noff at 1.0<z<2.0, but shows no sign of declining. Combining our SN Ia rate\nmeasurements and those from the literature, and comparing to a wide range of\npossible SFHs, the best-fit DTD is a power law of the form Psi(t) ~ t^beta,\nwith beta = -1.1 +/- 0.1 (statistical) +/- 0.17 (systematic). This result is\nconsistent with other recent DTD measurements at various redshifts and\nenvironments, and is in agreement with a generic prediction of the\ndouble-degenerate progenitor scenario for SNe Ia. By combining the contribution\nto iron production from core-collapse SNe, based on the wide range of SFHs,\nwith that from SNe Ia, calculated with the best-fit DTD, we predict that the\nmean present-day cosmic iron abundance is in the range Z(Fe) = (0.09-0.37)\nZ(Fe,Sun) (abridged). \n\n"}

Within these circumstances it has been shown that cold pure hadronic\ncompact stars above a threshold value of their gravitational mass are\nmetastable with respect to the \"decay\" to quark stars (compact stars made at\nleast in part of quark matter). This stellar conversion process liberates a\nhuge amount of energy, and it could be the energy source of some of the long\nGRBs. The main goal of the present work is to establish whether a newborn\nhadronic star (proto-hadronic star) could survive the early stages of its\nevolution without \"decaying\" to a quark star. To this aim, we study the\nnucleation process of quark matter in hot beta-stable hadronic matter, with and\nwithout trapped neutrinos.

The evolutionary history of each element is different\nowing to the effects of the initial progenitor mass and metallicity on element\nproduction.

Also in the bulge, the abundances of [(Na, Al, P, Cl, K,\nSc, Cu, Zn)/Fe] are higher because of the effect of metallicity on element\nproduction from core-collapse supernovae. According to our predictions, it is\npossible to find metal-rich stars ([Fe/H]>-1) that formed in the early Universe\nas a result of rapid star formation.

After initially considering radio loudnesses derived using total\nradio luminosities, we repeat the investigation using core radio luminosities\nonly, applying a previously established mass correction for these core\nluminosities. In both cases, for Eddington ratios < 1 per cent, Fanaroff-Riley\ntype I and broad-line radio galaxies are on average more radio-loud than\nSeyfert and low-ionization nuclear emission-line region galaxies. However, the\ndistribution of radio loudnesses for the mass-corrected, core-only sample is\nmuch narrower than that of the clearly bimodal total radio loudness\ndistribution. The advantages and disadvantages of using core- or lobe-dominated\nradio luminosity as a measure of instantaneous jet power are discussed.

The majority (7 out of\n11) of the heavily obscured AGNs have excess IR emission over that expected\nfrom star formation (termed \"IR-excess galaxies\"). However, we find that X-ray\ndetected heavily obscured AGNs only comprise ~25% of the IR-excess galaxy\npopulation, which is otherwise composed of relatively unobscured AGNs and\nstarburst galaxies. We find that the typical X-ray spectrum of the heavily\nobscured AGNs is better characterized by a pure reflection model than an\nabsorbed power-law model, suggesting extreme Compton-thick absorption in some\nsystems.

Supersonic motion, producing\na wake of spiral-onion shell structure, exhibits a single-armed Archimedes\nspiral and two-centered circular arcs with respect to the line of sight. The\npitch angle, arm width, and spacing of the spiral pattern are entirely\ndetermined by the orbital distance $r_p$ and Mach number of the object. The\narm-interarm density contrast is proportional to the Bondi accretion radius,\ndecreasing as a function of distance with a power index of -1. The background\ndensity distribution is globally changed from initially uniform to centrally\nconcentrated. The vertical structure of the wake is manifested as circular arcs\nwith the center at the object location. The angular extent of the arcs is\ndetermined by the Mach number of the object motion. Diagnostic probes of\nnonlinear wakes such as a detached bow shock, an absence of the definite inner\narm boundary, the presence of turbulent low density eddies, and elongated\nshapes of arcs are explained in the extension of the linear analysis. The\ndensity enhancement at the center is always $r_B/r_p$ independent of the\nnonlinearity, suggesting that massive objects can substantially modify the\nbackground distribution.

We compute the orbits\nconfined by the invariant manifolds of the unstable periodic orbits located at\nthe ends of the bar. We discuss whether the COBE/DIRBE bar and the Long bar\ncompose a single bar or two independent bars and perform a number of\ncomparisons which, taken together, argue strongly in favour of the former. More\nspecifically, we favour the possibility that the so-called COBE/DIRBE bar is\nthe boxy/peanut bulge of a bar whose outer thin parts are the so-called Long\nbar. This possibility is in good agreement both with observations of external\ngalaxies, with orbital structure theory and with simulations. We then analyse\nin detail the morphology and kinematics given by five representative Galactic\npotentials. Two have a Ferrers bar, two have a quadrupole bar and the last one\na composite bar.

To large extent, cooling is\noffset by heating due to active galactic nuclei (AGN) via jets. The cool-core\nclusters, with cooler/denser plasmas, show multiphase gas and signs of some\ncooling in their cores. These observations suggest that the cool core is\nlocally thermally unstable while maintaining global thermal equilibrium. Using\nhigh-resolution, three-dimensional simulations we study the formation of\nmultiphase gas in cluster cores heated by highly-collimated bipolar AGN jets.\nOur key conclusion is that spatially extended multiphase filaments form only\nwhen the instantaneous ratio of the thermal instability and free-fall\ntimescales (t_TI/t_ff) falls below a critical threshold of \\approx 10. When\nthis happens, dense cold gas decouples from the hot ICM phase and generates\ninhomogeneous and spatially extended Halpha filaments. These cold gas clumps\nand filaments `rain' down onto the central regions of the core, forming a cold\nrotating torus and in part feeding the supermassive black hole. Consequently,\nthe self-regulated feedback enhances AGN heating and the core returns to a\nhigher entropy level with t_TI/t_ff > 10. Eventually the core reaches\nquasi-stable global thermal equilibrium, and cold filaments condense out of the\nhot ICM whenever t_TI/t_ff \\lesssim 10. This occurs despite the fact that the\nenergy from AGN jets is supplied to the core in a highly anisotropic fashion.\nThe effective spatial redistribution of heat is enabled in part by the\nturbulent motions in the wake of freely-falling cold filaments. Increased AGN\nactivity can locally reverse the cold gas flow, launching cold filamentary gas\naway from the cluster center. Our criterion for the condensation of spatially\nextended cold gas is in agreement with observations and previous idealized\nsimulations. \n\n"}

The\nChimera scheme is a hybrid method that combines tools from different\napproximation techniques in General Relativity: (i) A multipolar,\npost-Minkowskian expansion for the far-zone metric perturbation (the\ngravitational waveforms) and for the local prescription of the self-force; (ii)\na post-Newtonian expansion for the computation of the multipole moments in\nterms of the trajectories; and (iii) a BH perturbation theory expansion when\ntreating the trajectories as a sequence of self-adjusting Kerr geodesics.

The former result from\nthe direct collapse of gas in T_s^h >1.5x10^4K, H_2-free halos; the latter are\nthe endproduct of a standard H_2-based star formation process. The H_2-free\ncondition is attained by exposing halos to a strong (J_21 > 10^3) Lyman-Werner\nUV background produced by both accreting BHs and stars, thus establishing a\nself-regulated growth regime. We find that this condition is met already at z\nclose to 18 in the highly biased regions in which quasars are born. The key\nparameter allowing the formation of SMBHs by z=6-7 is the fraction of halos\nthat can form heavy seeds: the minimum requirement is that f_heavy>0.001; SMBH\nas large as 2x10^10 Msol can be obtained when f_heavy approaches unity.\nIndependently of f_heavy, the model produces a high-z stellar bulge-black hole\nmass relation which is steeper than the local one, implying that SMBHs formed\nbefore their bulge was in place. The formation of heavy seeds, allowed by the\nLyman-Werner radiative feedback in the quasar-forming environment, is crucial\nto achieve a fast growth of the SMBH by merger events in the early phases of\nits evolution, i.e. z>7. The UV photon production is largely dominated by stars\nin galaxies, i.e. black hole accretion radiation is sub-dominant.\nInterestingly, we find that the final mass of light BHs and of the SMBH in the\nquasar is roughly equal by z=6; by the same time only 19% of the initial baryon\ncontent has been converted into stars. The SMBH growth is dominated at all\nepochs z > 7.2 by mergers (exceeding accretion by a factor 2-50); at later\ntimes accretion becomes by far the most important growth channel.

A number of the simplifying assumptions are unjustified,\nincluding: first, the adoption of an assumed power-law source-count\ndistribution, dN/dS, to arbitrary low source fluxes, which is not exhibited in\nphysical models of the blazar population; and, second, the lack of blazar\nspectral information in calculating the anisotropy of unresolved gamma-ray\nblazar emission. We also show that the calculation of the unresolved blazars'\nanisotropy is very sensitive to the spectral distribution of the unresolved\nblazars through the adopted source resolution threshold value, and must be\ntaken into account in an accurate anisotropy calculation. \n\n"}

The long-duration gravitational-waveforms emitted\nby such systems encode the structure of the strong field region of the massive\nblack hole, in which the inspiral occurs. The detection and analysis of EMRIs\nwill therefore allow us to study the geometry of massive black holes and\ndetermine whether their nature is as predicted by General Relativity and even\nto test whether General Relativity is the correct theory to describe the\ndynamics of these systems. To achieve this, EMRI modeling in alternative\ntheories of gravity is required to describe the generation of gravitational\nwaves. In this paper, we explore to what extent EMRI observations with LISA or\neLISA/NGO might be able to distinguish between General Relativity and a\nparticular modification of it, known as Dynamical Chern-Simons Modified\nGravity. Our analysis is based on a parameter estimation study that uses\napproximate gravitational waveforms obtained via a radiative-adiabatic method\nand is restricted to a five-dimensional subspace of the EMRI configuration\nspace. This includes a Chern-Simons parameter that controls the strength of\ngravitational deviations from General Relativity. We find that, if Dynamical\nChern-Simons Modified Gravity is the correct theory, an observatory like LISA\nor even eLISA/NGO should be able to measure the Chern-Simons parameter with\nfractional errors below 5%. If General Relativity is the true theory, these\nobservatories should put bounds on this parameter at the level xi^(1/4) < 10^4\nkm, which is four orders of magnitude better than current Solar System bounds. \n\n"}

For example, it was\nrecently shown that the observed helical structures in the jet in S5 0836+710\ncould be associated with helical pressure waves generated by Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability. Our aim is to resolve the arc-second structure of the jet in the\nquasar S5 0836+710 and confirm the lack of a hot-spot (reverse jet-shock) found\nby present observing arrays, as this lack implies a loss of jet collimation\nbefore interaction with the intergalactic medium. In this work, we use an\nobservation performed in 2008 using EVN and MERLIN. The combined data reduction\nhas provided a complete image of the object at arc-second scales. The lack of a\nhot-spot in the arc-second radio structure is taken as evidence that the jet\nlosses its collimation between the VLBI region and the region of interaction\nwith the ambient medium.

The earliest supernovae in low-mass dSphs have less gas to\npollute than the earliest supernovae in massive halo progenitors. As a result,\ndSph stars at -3 < [Fe/H] < -2 sample supernovae with [Fe/H] << -3, whereas\nhalo stars in the same metallicity range sample supernovae with [Fe/H] ~ -3.\nConsequently, enhancements in [Na/Fe] and [r/Fe] were deferred to higher\nmetallicity in dSphs than in the progenitors of the inner halo. \n\n"}

Abstract: The Local Group is often seen to be a quiescent environment without\nsignificant merger events. However an ancient major merger may have occurred in\nthe most massive galaxy. Numerical simulations have shown that tidal tails\nformed during gas-rich major mergers are long-lived and could be responsible\nfor old stellar streams and likely induce the formation of tidal dwarf galaxies\n(TDGs). Using several hydrodynamical simulations we have investigated the most\nprominent tidal tail formed during the first passage, which is gas-rich and\ncontains old and metal poor stars. We discovered several striking coincidences\nafter comparing its location and motion to those of the Milky Way (MW) and of\nthe Magellanic Clouds (MCs). First, the tidal tail is sweeping a relatively\nsmall volume in which the MW precisely lies. Because the geometry of the merger\nis somehow fixed by the anisotropic properties of the Giant Stream (GS), we\nevaluate the chance of the MW to be at such a rendez-vous with this gigantic\ntidal tail to be 5 %. Second, the velocity of the tidal tail matches the LMC\nproper motion, and reproduce quite well the geometrical and angular momentum\nproperties of the MW dwarfs, i.e. the so-called disk of satellites, better\ncalled Vast Polar Structure (VPOS). Third, the simulation of the tidal tail\nreveals one of the formed TDG with mass and location almost comparable to those\nof the LMC. Our present modeling is however too limited to study the detailed\ninteraction of gas-rich TDGs with the potential of the MW, and a complementary\nstudy is required to test whether the dwarf intrinsic properties can be\naccounted for by our scenario. Nevertheless this study suggests a causal link\nbetween an ancient, gas-rich major merger at the M31 location, and several\nenigma in the Local Group, the GS, the VPOS, and the presence of the MCs. \n\n"}

Interior to 3.5 kpc, the effects of\nthe Galactic bulge cannot be neglected and the in-plane tidal components are as\nimportant as the vertical ones. Here, we quantify the orbital changes induced\nby these tides. We find that the greatest perturbations occur when the\nplanetary orbit is severely misaligned to the parent star's orbit. When both\nplanes are perpendicular, the eccentricity of the planet is driven to unity,\nalthough the semimajor axis is secularly unaffected. When both planes are\ncoincident, the effect from Galactic tides is minimized, but remains non-zero.\nIn these cases, we provide estimates for the survival times, as well as the\nminimum baseline eccentricity variation for all Milky Way exoplanets as a\nfunction of Galactic parameters. Inclinations similar to the Solar System's\n(about 60 degrees) can easily cause eccentric Neptunes (at about 30 AU) around\nhost stars deep within the Galactic bulge (within 50 pc) to experience\neccentricity variations of several tenths, and cause the exoplanets with the\nwidest-known separations (at about 1000 AU) to experience similar variations in\nthe Galactic disc. These variations occur on timescales of a few Gyr, a\nfraction of a typical main sequence lifetime. \n\n"}

The lack of knowledge of photospheric parameters and the level of\nchromospheric activity in young low-mass pre-main sequence stars introduces\nuncertainties when measuring mass accretion rates in accreting (Class II) Young\nStellar Objects. A detailed investigation of the effect of chromospheric\nemission on the estimates of mass accretion rate in young low-mass stars is\nstill missing. This can be undertaken using samples of young diskless (Class\nIII) K and M-type stars. Aims. Our goal is to measure the chromospheric\nactivity of Class III pre main sequence stars to determine its effect on the\nestimates of accretion luminosity (Lacc) and mass accretion rate (Macc) in\nyoung stellar objects with disks. Methods. Using VLT/X-Shooter spectra we have\nanalyzed a sample of 24 non-accreting young stellar objects of spectral type\nbetween K5 and M9.5. We identify the main emission lines normally used as\ntracers of accretion in Class II objects, and we determine their fluxes in\norder to estimate the contribution of the chromospheric activity to the line\nluminosity. Results. We have used the relationships between line luminosity and\naccretion luminosity derived in the literature for Class II objects to evaluate\nthe impact of chromospheric activity on the accretion rate measurements. We\nfind that the typical chromospheric activity would bias the derived accretion\nluminosity by Lacc,noise< 10-3Lsun, with a strong dependence with the Teff of\nthe objects. The noise on Macc depends on stellar mass and age, and the typical\nvalues of log(Macc,noise) range between -9.2 to -11.6Msun/yr. Conclusions.\nValues of Lacc< 10-3Lsun obtained in accreting low-mass pre main sequence stars\nthrough line luminosity should be treated with caution as the line emission may\nbe dominated by the contribution of chromospheric activity. \n\n"}

The clumps show, for the first time in a \"dense\ngas tracer\", a significant correlation between HCO+ line emission from cold\nmolecular gas and Br{\\gamma} line emission of associated nebulae. This\ncorrelation arises in the HCO+ line's brightness, not its linewidth. In\ncontrast, the correlation between the N2H+ line emission and Br{\\gamma} is weak\nor absent. The HCO+/N2H+ line ratio also varies widely from clump to clump:\nbright HCO+ emission tends to be more closely associated with Br{\\gamma}\nnebulosity, while bright N2H+ emission tends to avoid areas that are bright in\nBr{\\gamma}. Both molecular species show correlations of weak significance with\ninfrared H2 v=1-0 and v=2-1 line emission, in or near the clumps. The H2\nemission line ratio is consistent with fluorescent excitation in most of the\nclumps, although thermal excitation is seen in a few clumps. We interpret these\ntrends as evidence for evolution in the gas conditions due to the effects of\nongoing star formation in the clumps, in particular, the importance of UV\nradiation from massive YSOs as the driving agent that heats the molecular gas\nand alters its chemistry. This suggests that some traditional dense gas tracers\nof molecular clouds do not sample a homogeneous population of clumps, i.e.,\nthat the HCO+ brightness in particular is directly related to the heating and\ndisruption of cold gas by massive young stars, whereas the N2H+ better samples\ngas not yet affected by this process.

Serendipitous ALMA observations of a strong\n  gamma-ray flare Abstract: The launching mechanism of the jets of active galactic nuclei is\nobservationally poorly constrained, due to the large distances to these objects\nand the very small scales (sub-parsec) involved. In order to better constrain\ntheoretical models, it is especially important to get information from the\nregion close to the physical base of the jet, where the plasma acceleration\ntakes place. In this paper, we report multi-epoch and multi-frequency continuum\nobservations of the z=2.5 blazar PKS1830-211 with ALMA, serendipitously\ncoincident with a strong $\\gamma$-ray flare reported by Fermi-LAT. The blazar\nis lensed by a foreground z=0.89 galaxy, with two bright images of the compact\ncore separated by 1\". Our ALMA observations individually resolve these two\nimages (although not any of their substructures), and we study the change of\ntheir relative flux ratio with time (four epochs spread over nearly three times\nthe time delay between the two lensed images) and frequency (between 350 and\n1050 GHz, rest-frame of the blazar), during the $\\gamma$-ray flare. In\nparticular, we detect a remarkable frequency-dependent behaviour of the flux\nratio, which implies the presence of a chromatic structure in the blazar (i.e.,\na core-shift effect). We rule out the possiblity of micro- and milli-lensing\neffects and propose instead a simple model of plasmon ejection in the blazar's\njet to explain the time and frequency variability of the flux ratio. We suggest\nthat PKS1830-211 is likely one of the best sources to probe the activity at the\nbase of a blazar's jet at submillimeter wavelengths, thanks to the peculiar\ngeometry of the system. The implications of the core-shift in absorption\nstudies of the foreground z=0.89 galaxy (e.g., constraints on the cosmological\nvariations of fundamental constants) are discussed. \n\n"}

We now explore a\nnew constraint on such activity. The Magellanic Stream is a clumpy gaseous\nstructure passing over the South Galactic Pole (SGP) at a distance of at least\n50-100 kpc. Patchy H-alpha emission discovered along the Magellanic Stream over\nthe SGP is a factor of 5 too bright to have been produced by the Galactic\nstellar population. Time-dependent models of Stream clouds exposed to a flare\nin ionising photon flux show that the ionised gas must recombine and cool for a\ntime interval 0.6 - 2.9 Myr for the emitted H-alpha surface brightness to drop\nto the observed level. A nuclear starburst is ruled out. Sgr A* is a more\nlikely candidate because it is two orders of magnitude more efficient at\nconverting gas to UV radiation. The central black hole (4 x 10^6 Msun) can\nsupply the required ionising luminosity with a fraction of the Eddington\naccretion rate (3-30%). In support of nuclear activity, the H-alpha emission\nalong the Stream has a polar angle dependence peaking close to the SGP.\nMoreover, it is now generally accepted that the Stream over the SGP must be\nfurther than the Magellanic Clouds.

Both cold and warm dust column densities are\nhigh in star forming regions and reach their maxima toward the giant star\nforming complexes NGC604 and NGC595. beta declines from close to 2 in the\ncenter to about 1.3 in the outer disk. beta is positively correlated with star\nformation and with molecular gas column, as traced by Halpha and CO emission.\nThe lower dust emissivity index in the outer parts of M33 is likely related to\nthe reduced metallicity (different grain composition) and possibly different\nsize distribution.

This could either be due to a true divergence in orbital\nperiod distributions of these two types of system, or to black hole LMXBs being\npreferentially hidden from view at short orbital periods. We explore the latter\npossibility, by investigating whether black hole LMXBs could be concealed by a\nswitch to radiatively inefficient accretion at low luminosities. The peak\nluminosity and the duration of X-ray binary outbursts are related to the disc\nradius and, hence, the orbital period. At short periods, where the peak\noutburst luminosity drops close to the threshold for radiatively inefficient\naccretion, black hole LMXBs have lower outburst luminosities, shorter outburst\ndurations and lower X-ray duty cycles than comparable neutron star systems.\nThese factors can combine to severely reduce the detection probability of short\nperiod black hole LMXBs relative to those containing neutron stars. We estimate\nthe outburst properties and orbital period distribution of black hole LMXBs\nusing two models of the transition to radiatively inefficient accretion: an\ninstantaneous drop in accretion efficiency (eta) to zero, at a fraction (f) of\nthe Eddington luminosity (L_Edd) and a power-law efficiency decrease, eta\n\\propto \\dot{M}^n, for L < f*L_Edd.

The modeled stars have masses in the range 0.9-2.5 M_sun and are\nlocated at distances between 2.5 kpc and 6.2 kpc. Two triple-mode and one\ndouble-mode pulsators seem to be Population II stars of the SX Phe type,\nprobably from the Galactic halo. Our sample also includes candidates for Type\nII Cepheids and unclassified short-period (P<0.23 d) multi-mode stars which\ncould be either delta Sct or beta Cep type stars. One of the detected variables\nis a very likely delta Sct star with an exceptionally high peak-to-peak I-band\namplitude of 0.35 mag at the very short period of 0.0196 d. All reported\npulsating variables but one object are new discoveries. They are included in\nthe OGLE-III Catalog of Variable Stars.

A small fraction of\nthese stars shows dipole modes with unexpectedly low amplitudes. The reduction\nin amplitude is more pronounced for stars with higher frequency of maximum\npower. In this work we want to characterize KIC 8561221 in order to confirm\nthat it is currently the least evolved star among this peculiar subset and to\ndiscuss several hypotheses that could help explain the reduction of the dipole\nmode amplitudes. We used Kepler short- and long-cadence data combined with\nspectroscopic observations to infer the stellar structure and dynamics of KIC\n8561221. We then discussed different scenarios that could contribute to the\nreduction of the dipole amplitudes such as a fast rotating interior or the\neffect of a magnetic field on the properties of the modes. We also performed a\ndetailed study of the inertia and damping of the modes. We have been able to\ncharacterize 37 oscillations modes, in particular, a few dipole modes above\nnu_max that exhibit nearly normal amplitudes. We have inferred a surface\nrotation period of around 91 days and uncovered the existence of a variation in\nthe surface magnetic activity during the last 4 years. As expected, the\ninternal regions of the star probed by the l = 2 and 3 modes spin 4 to 8 times\nfaster than the surface.

EXors, a loosely\ndefined class of pre-main sequence stars, exhibit shorter and repetitive\noutbursts, associated with lower accretion rates. The relationship between the\ntwo classes, and their connection to the standard pre-main sequence\nevolutionary sequence, is an open question: do they represent two distinct\nclasses, are they triggered by the same physical mechanism, and do they occur\nin the same evolutionary phases? Over the past couple of decades, many\ntheoretical and numerical models have been developed to explain the origin of\nFUor and EXor outbursts.

These composite SEDs were previously\nconstructed from the photometric catalogs of the NEWFIRM Medium-Band Survey, by\nstacking the observed photometry of galaxies that have similar rest-frame\nNUV-to-NIR SEDs. In this work, we include a stacked MIPS 24 micron measurement\nfor each SED type to extend the SEDs to rest-frame MIR wavelengths. Consistent\nwith previous studies, the observed MIR emission for most SED types is higher\nthan expected from only the attenuated stellar emission. We fit the NUV-to-MIR\ncomposite SEDs by the Flexible Stellar Population Synthesis (SPS) models, which\ninclude both stellar and dust emission. We compare the best-fit star formation\nrates (SFRs) to the SFRs based on simple UV+IR estimators. Interestingly, the\nUV and IR luminosities overestimate SFRs - compared to the model SFRs - by more\nthan ~ 1 dex for quiescent galaxies, while for the highest star-forming\ngalaxies in our sample the two SFRs are broadly consistent. The difference in\nspecific SFRs also shows a gradually increasing trend with declining specific\nSFR, implying that quiescent galaxies have even lower specific SFRs than\npreviously found. Contributions from evolved stellar populations to both the UV\nand the MIR SEDs most likely explain the discrepancy. Based on this work, we\nconclude that SFRs should be determined from modeling the attenuated stellar\nand dust emission simultaneously, instead of employing simple UV+IR-based SFR\nestimators. \n\n"}

In this paper, we analyze flux calibrated optical\nspectra to measure accurate spectral types and extinctions of 283 nearby T\nTauri stars. The primary advances in this paper are (1) the incorporation of a\nsimplistic accretion continuum in optical spectral type and extinction\nmeasurements calculated over the full optical wavelength range and (2) the\nuniform analysis of a large sample of stars. Comparisons between the\nnon-accreting TTS photospheric templates and stellar photosphere models are\nused to derive conversions from spectral type to temperature.

A dependence\nof the halo mass function on large-scale mean density is a standard element of\ncosmological theory, allowing mass-dependent biasing to be understood via the\npeak-background split. On the assumption of a Gaussian density field, this\nanalysis can be extended to ask how the mass function depends on the\ngeometrical environment: clusters, filaments, sheets and voids, as classified\nvia the tidal tensor (the Hessian matrix of the gravitational potential). In\nlinear theory, the problem can be solved exactly, and the result is\nattractively simple: the conditional mass function has no explicit dependence\non the local tidal field, and is a function only of the local density on the\nfiltering scale used to define the tidal tensor. There is nevertheless a strong\nimplicit predicted dependence on geometrical environment, because the local\ndensity couples statistically to the derivatives of the potential.

Typically one of these\noscillations is strongly non-sinusoidal. Two oscillations are sufficient for\nthe standard Blazhko effect; additional oscillations are needed to explain\nmulti-frequency modulation. Previous work on this hypothesis by Arthur N.

We found that, in the mass range of 10^4 -10^5\nM_{sun}, our DSs are hotter by a factor of 1.5 than those in Freese et\nal.(2010), are smaller in radius by a factor of 0.6, denser by a factor of 3 -\n4, and more luminous by a factor of 2. Our models also confirm previous\nresults, according to which supermassive DSs are very well approximated by\n(n=3)-polytropes. We also perform a first study of dark star pulsations. Our DS\nmodels have pulsation modes with timescales ranging from less than a day to\nmore than two years in their rest frames, at z ~ 15, depending on DM particle\nmass and overtone number.

The precise nature\nof the progenitor, however, remains debated owing to spectral ambiguities\narising from a strong contribution from the CSM interaction. Late-time spectra\noffer potential insight if the post-shock cold, dense shell becomes\nsufficiently thin and/or the ejecta begin to cross the reverse shock. To date,\nfew high-quality spectra of this kind exist. Here we report on the late-time\noptical and infrared spectra of the SNe~Ia-CSM 2012ca and 2013dn. These SNe\nIa-CSM spectra exhibit low [Fe III]/[Fe II] ratios and strong [Ca II] at late\nepochs. Such characteristics are reminiscent of the super-Chandrasekhar-mass\n(SC) candidate SN 2009dc, for which these features suggested a low-ionisation\nstate due to high densities, although the broad Fe features admittedly show\nsimilarities to the blue \"quasi-continuum\" observed in some core-collapse SNe\nIbn and IIn. Neither SN 2012ca nor any of the other SNe Ia-CSM show evidence\nfor broad oxygen, carbon, or magnesium in their spectra. Similar to the\ninteracting Type IIn SN 2005ip, a number of high-ionisation lines are\nidentified in SN 2012ca, including [S III], [Ar III], [Ar X], [Fe VIII], [Fe\nX], and possibly [Fe XI]. The total bolometric energy output does not exceed\n10^51 erg, but does require a large kinetic-to-radiative conversion efficiency.\nAll of these observations taken together suggest that SNe Ia-CSM are more\nconsistent with a thermonuclear explosion than a core-collapse event, although\ndetailed radiative transfer models are certainly necessary to confirm these\nresults. \n\n"}

In almost all models\nwe find that significant numbers of black holes (up to $\\sim10^3$) are retained\nall the way to the present. This is in contrast to previous theoretical\nexpectations that most black holes should be ejected dynamically within a few\nGyr. The main reason for this difference is that core collapse driven by black\nholes (through the Spitzer \"mass segregation instability\") is easily reverted\nthrough three-body processes, and involves only a small number of the most\nmassive black holes, while lower-mass black holes remain well-mixed with\nordinary stars far from the central cusp. Thus the rapid segregation of stellar\nblack holes does not lead to a long-term physical separation of most black\nholes into a dynamically decoupled inner core, as often assumed previously.\nCombined with the recent detections of several black hole X-ray binary\ncandidates in Galactic globular clusters, our results suggest that stellar\nblack holes could still be present in large numbers in many globular clusters\ntoday, and that they may play a significant role in shaping the long-term\ndynamical evolution and the present-day dynamical structure of many clusters. \n\n"}

According to this model, when the\nionization--shock front leaves the cloud it causes the formation of an\naccelerating dense gas shell.

It has been suggested that\nmultiple scatterings of SN photons by CS dust may explain the non-standard\nreddening law. In this paper, we examine the effect of re-emission of SN\nphotons by CS dust in the infrared (IR) wavelength regime. This effect allows\nthe observed IR light curves to be used as a constraint on the position/size\nand the amount of CS dust. The method was applied to observed near-infrared\n(NIR) SN Ia samples; meaningful upper limits on the CS dust mass were derived\neven under conservative assumptions. We thereby clarify a difficulty associated\nwith the CS dust scattering model as a general explanation for the peculiar\nreddening law, while it may still apply to a sub-sample of highly reddened SNe\nIa. For SNe Ia in general, the environment at the interstellar scale appears to\nbe responsible for the non-standard extinction law. Furthermore, deeper limits\ncan be obtained using the standard nature of SN Ia NIR light curves. In this\napplication, an upper limit of Mdot ~10^{-8}-10^{-7} Msun/yr (for the wind\nvelocity of ~10 km/s) is obtained for a mass loss rate from a progenitor up to\n~0.01 pc, and Mdot ~10^{-7}-10^{-6} Msun/yr up to ~0.1 pc. \n\n"}

OH231\nalso presents an exceptional molecular richness probably due to shock-induced\nchemical processes. We report the first detection in this source of HNCO, HNCS,\nHC3N and NO, with the IRAM-30m telescope in a sensitive mm-wavelength survey\ntowards this target. HNCO and HNCS are also first detections in CSEs. The\nobserved line profiles show that the emission arises in the massive central\ncomponent of the envelope and at the base of the fast lobes. The NO profiles\nare broader than those of HNCO, HNCS, and HC3N, and most importantly, broader\nthan the line profiles of 13CO. This indicates that the NO abundance is\nenhanced in the fast lobes relative to the slow, central parts. From LTE and\nnon-LTE excitation analysis, we estimate beam-average rotational temperatures\nof 15-30 K (and, maybe, up to 55 K for HC3N) and fractional abundances of\nX(HNCO)=[0.8-1]E-7, X(HNCS)=[0.9-1]E-8, X(HC3N)=[5-7]E-9 and X(NO)=[1-2]E-6.

Our aim is to\nquantify the feedback, mechanical and radiative, for a large sample of low-mass\nsources. The outflow activity is compared to radiative feedback in the form of\nUV heating by the accreting protostar to search for correlations and\nevolutionary trends. Large-scale maps of 26 young stellar objects, which are\npart of the Herschel WISH key program are obtained using the CHAMP+ instrument\non the APEX (12CO and 13CO 6-5), and the HARP-B instrument on the JCMT (12CO\nand 13CO 3-2).

All sources in our sample show outflow activity and\nthe outflow force, F_CO, is larger for Class 0 sources than for Class I\nsources, even if their luminosities are comparable.

To better understand the role of resonance scattering in\nshaping the H Lyman alpha line profiles, we directly compare them to\nnon-resonant emission lines in optical spectra. We find that the line wings are\nalready present in the intrinsic nebular spectra, and scattering merely\nenhances the wings relative to the line core. The H Lyman alpha attenuation (as\nmeasured in the COS aperture) ranges from that of the far-UV continuum to over\n100 times more. A simple radiative transfer model suggests the H Lyman alpha\nphotons escape through cavities which have low column densities of neutral\nhydrogen and become optically thin to the Lyman continuum in the most advanced\nmergers. We show that the properties of the highly blueshifted line wings on\nthe H Lyman alpha and optical emission-line profiles are consistent with\nemission from clumps of gas condensing out of a fast, hot wind. The luminosity\nof the H Lyman alpha emission increases non-linearly with the ULIRG bolometric\nluminosity and represents about 0.1 to 1% of the radiative cooling from the hot\nwinds in the HII-dominated ULIRGs. \n\n"}

METHODS: Using high-resolution spectra obtained with MIKE, FEROS,\nSOFIN, FIES, UVES and HARPS spectrographs, we determine Sc, V, Mn, and Co\nabundances for a large sample of F and G dwarfs in Solar neighbourhood. The\nmethod is based on spectral synthesis and using one-dimensional (1-D),\nplane-parallel, LTE model stellar atmospheres calculated with the MARCS 2012\ncode. NLTE corrections from literature were applied to Mn and Co. RESULTS: We\nfind that the abundance trends derived for Sc (594 stars), V (466 stars), and\nCo (567 stars) are very similar to what has been observed for the\nalpha-elements in the thin and thick disks. On the contrary Mn (569 stars) is\ngenerally underabundant relative to the Sun (i.e. [Mn/Fe]<0) for [Fe/H]<0.\nAlso, for Mn, when NLTE corrections are applied, the trend changes and is\nalmost flat over the entire metallicity range that the stars in our sample span\n(-2<[Fe/H]<+0.4). The [Sc/Fe]-[Fe/H] abundance trends show a small separation\nbetween the thin and thick disks, while for V and Co they completely overlap.\nFor Mn there is a small difference in [Mn/Fe] but only when NLTE corrections\nare used. Comparisons with Ti as a reference element show flat trends for all\nthe elements except for Mn that show well separated [Mn/Ti]-[Ti/H] trends for\nthe thin and thick disks. CONCLUSIONS: Sc and V present trends compatible with\nproduction from SNII events. In addition, Sc clearly shows a metallicity\ndependence for [Fe/H]<-1. Mn instead is produced in SNII events for [Fe/H]<-0.4\nand then SNIa start to produce Mn.

Traditionally, the emission lines employed\nare in the visible wavelength range, and the number of suitable lines is\nlimited. Furthermore, when using these lines, large systematic uncertainties in\nhelium abundance determinations arise due to the degeneracy of physical\nparameters, such as temperature and density.

Our observations\ntherefore constrain the average spectra of luminous accreting binaries (i.e.,\nULXs). This result is similar to the super-Eddington accreting ULXs that have\nbeen studied individually in a targeted NuSTAR ULX program. We also find that\nNGC 3310 exhibits a factor of ~3-10 elevation of X-ray emission over the other\nstar-forming galaxies.

This uncertainty about the underlying physics has resulted\nin various different star formation laws, all having substantial intrinsic\nscatter. Extending upon previous works that define the column density of star\nformation (Sigma_SFR) by the gas column density (Sigma_gas), we develop a new\nuniversal star formation (SF) law based on the multi-freefall prescription of\ngas. This new SF law relies predominantly on the probability density function\n(PDF) and on the sonic Mach number of the turbulence in the star-forming\nclouds. By doing so we derive a relation where the star formation rate (SFR)\ncorrelates with the molecular gas mass per multi-freefall time, whereas\nprevious models had used the average, single-freefall time. We define a new\nquantity called maximum (multi-freefall) gas consumption rate (MGCR) and show\nthat the actual SFR is only about 0.4% of this maximum possible SFR, confirming\nthe observed low efficiency of star formation. We show that placing\nobservations in this new framework (Sigma_SFR vs. MGCR) yields a significantly\nimproved correlation with 3-4 times reduced scatter compared to previous SF\nlaws and a goodness-of-fit parameter R^2=0.97. By inverting our new\nrelationship, we provide sonic Mach number predictions for kpc-scale\nobservations of Local Group galaxies as well as unresolved observations of\nlocal and high-redshift disk and starburst galaxies that do not have\nindependent, reliable estimates for the turbulent cloud Mach number. \n\n"}

We find that there exists three\ncharacterizable stages of the evolution of the collapsing cloud which we term\n\"early,\" \"intermediate,\" and \"advanced.\" At early times, i.e. $t<0.15t_{ff}$,\nthe column density has a power spectral slope similar to nongravitating\nsupersonic turbulence and a lognormal distribution. At an intermediate stage,\ni.e. $0.15t_{ff}< t \\leq 0.35t_{ff}$, there exists signatures of the prestellar\ncores in the shallower PDF and power spectrum power law slopes. The column\ndensity PDF power law tails at these times have line of sight averaged slopes\nranging from -2.5 to -1.5 with shallower values belonging to simulations with\nlower magnetic field strength. The density power spectrum slope becomes shallow\nand can be characterized by $P(k)=A_1k^{\\beta_2}e^{-k/k_c}$, where $A_1$\ndescribes the amplitude, $k^{\\beta_2}$ describes the classical power law\nbehavior and the scale $k_c$ characterizes the turn over from turbulence\ndominated to self-gravity dominated. At advanced stages of collapse, i.e.\n$\\approx t>0.35t_{ff}$, the power spectral slope is positive valued, and a\ndramatic increase is observed in the PDF moments and the Tsallis incremental\nPDF parameters, which gives rise to deviations between PDF-sonic Mach number\nrelations. Finally, we show that the imprint of gravity on the density power\nspectrum can be replicated in non-gravitating turbulence by introducing a\ndelta-function with amplitude equivalent to the maximum valued point in a given\nself-gravitating map.

Wind models in which parameters do not explicitly depend on the\naccretion rate cannot reproduce the spin measurements.

We relate them to the evolution\nof galaxies through phases of gas compaction, depletion, possible\nreplenishment, and eventual quenching. We find that the high-SFR galaxies in\nthe upper envelope of the MS are compact, with high gas fractions and short\ndepletion times (\"blue nuggets\"), while the lower-SFR galaxies in the lower\nenvelope have lower central gas densities, lower gas fractions and longer\ndepletion times, consistent with observed gradients across the MS.\nStellar-structure gradients are negligible. The SFGs oscillate about the MS\nridge on timescales $\\sim0.4~t_{\\mathrm{Hubble}}$ ($\\sim1$ Gyr at $z\\sim3$).\nThe propagation upwards is due to gas compaction, triggered, e.g., by mergers,\ncounter-rotating streams, and/or violent disc instabilities.

An upturn at\nthe lower envelope can occur once the extended disc has been replenished by\nfresh gas and a new compaction can be triggered, namely as long as the\nreplenishment time is shorter than the depletion time.

Specifically, we focus on the statistical measurement of the\n21 cm power spectrum (PS) from the epoch of reionization (EoR) using the low\nfrequency array, SKA1-low. To facilitate this investigation we use the recently\ndeveloped MCMC based EoR analysis tool 21CMMC (Greig & Mesinger). In light of\nthe recent 50 per cent cost reduction, we consider several different SKA core\nbaseline designs, changing: (i) the number of antenna stations; (ii) the number\nof dipoles per station; and also (iii) the distribution of baseline lengths. We\nfind that a design with a reduced number of dipoles per core station (increased\nfield of view and total number of core stations), together with shortened\nbaselines, maximises the recovered EoR signal.

Since the inflaton quartic coupling is very small, once\nquantum corrections through the gauge and Yukawa interactions are taken into\naccount, the inflaton effective potential most likely becomes unstable.

Yet limiting the initial abundance spread in\nclusters has been hampered by difficulties in obtaining consistent\nspectroscopic abundances for different stellar types. Without reference to any\nspecific model of stellar photospheres, a model for a homogeneous cluster is\nthat it forms a one-dimensional sequence, with any differences between members\ndue to variations in stellar mass and observational uncertainties. I present a\nnovel method for investigating the abundance spread in open clusters that tests\nthis one-dimensional hypothesis at the level of observed stellar spectra,\nrather than constraining homogeneity using derived abundances as traditionally\ndone. Using high-resolution APOGEE spectra for 49 giants in M67, NGC 6819, and\nNGC 2420 I demonstrate that these spectra form one-dimensional sequences for\neach cluster. With detailed forward modeling of the spectra and Approximate\nBayesian Computation, I derive strong limits on the initial abundance spread of\n15 elements: <0.01 (0.02) dex for C and Fe, <~0.015 (0.03) dex for N, O, Mg,\nSi, and Ni, <~0.02 (0.03) dex for Al, Ca, and Mn, and <~0.03 (0.05) dex for Na,\nS, K, Ti, and V (at 68% and 95% confidence, respectively). The strong limits on\nC and O imply that no pollution by massive core-collapse supernovae occurred\nduring star formation in open clusters, which, thus, need to form within <~6\nMyr. Further development of this and related techniques will bring the power of\ndifferential abundances to stars other than solar twins in large spectroscopic\nsurveys and will help unravel the history of star formation and chemical\nenrichment in the Milky Way through chemical tagging. \n\n"}

Removal of\nfrequency-dependent interstellar medium (ISM) delays due to dispersion and\nscattering is a key issue in the detection process. Current timing algorithms\nroutinely correct pulse times of arrival (TOAs) for time-variable delays due to\ncold plasma dispersion. However, none of the major pulsar timing groups correct\nfor delays due to scattering from multi-path propagation in the ISM. Scattering\nintroduces a frequency-dependent phase change in the signal that results in\npulse broadening and arrival time delays. Any method to correct the TOA for\ninterstellar propagation effects must be based on multi-frequency measurements\nthat can effectively separate dispersion and scattering delay terms from\nfrequency-independent perturbations such as those due to a gravitational wave.\nCyclic spectroscopy, first described in an astronomical context by Demorest\n(2011), is a potentially powerful tool to assist in this multi-frequency\ndecomposition.

We focus on a few examples where stars form in two populations\ndistinct in age in order to elucidate the origin of these gradients. The\nspatial distributions of the two components reflect their diverse origin; the\nold stellar component is assembled through mergers, but the young population\nforms largely in situ.

Our high-resolution\nnear-infrared Keck~II adaptive optics imaging and archival Hubble Space\nTelescope data reveal the lensing galaxy in this system to have a clear edge-on\ndisc component that crosses directly over the pair of images that exhibit the\nflux-ratio anomaly. We find that simple models that include the disc can\nreproduce the cm-wavelength flux-ratio anomaly without requiring additional\ndark matter substructure. Although further studies are required, our results\nsuggest the assumption that all flux-ratio anomalies are due to a population of\ndark matter sub-haloes may be incorrect, and analyses that do not account for\nthe full complexity of the lens macro-model may overestimate the substructure\nmass fraction in massive lensing galaxies. \n\n"}

In this scenario, the\nanisotropic pressure magnetohydrodynamic (AMHD) turbulence shows a very\ndifferent statistical behaviour from the standard MHD one and is unable to\namplify seed magnetic fields, in disagreement with previous cosmological MHD\nsimulations which are successful to explain the observed magnetic fields in the\nICM.

The\nsignificantly low detection rate of asymmetric double-peaked profiles, together\nwith the well consistence among central velocities of CO, HCO+, and HCN\nspectra, suggests that the CO-selected Planck cores are more quiescent compared\nto classical star-forming regions. The small difference between line widths of\nC18O and HCN indicates that the inner regions of CO-selected Planck cores are\nnot more turbulent than the exterior.

A process generating strong magnetic fields\nonly in some stars must be responsible with the merging of pre-MS and MS stars\nbeing suggested as one such channel.

We\nfind that the rejuvenation is of the order of the nuclear timescale and is\nstrongest in the lowest-mass mergers and the most evolved binary progenitors\nwith the largest mass ratios.

The\nformyl radical HCO is an important candidate precursor for several O-bearing\nterrestrial COMs in cores, as an abundant building block of many of these\nmolecules.

Despite the very\nyoung age of HL Tau these structures have been interpreted as signatures for\nthe presence of (proto)planets. The ALMA images triggered numerous theoretical\nstudies based on disk-planet interactions, magnetically driven disk structures,\nand grain evolution. Of special interest are the inner parts of disks, where\nterrestrial planets are expected to form. However, the emission from these\nregions in HL Tau turned out to be optically thick at all ALMA wavelengths,\npreventing the derivation of surface density profiles and grain size\ndistributions. Here, we present the most sensitive images of HL Tau obtained to\ndate with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array at 7.0 mm wavelength with a\nspatial resolution comparable to the ALMA images. At this long wavelength the\ndust emission from HL Tau is optically thin, allowing a comprehensive study of\nthe inner disk.

Besides these\nmodulations, their quiescent light curves reveal several transient events: a\nsudden decrease of system light in 1RXS J0632+2536, a low level flare-like\nevent in QZ Vir, a short brightening event in RZ Leo and a temporary\ndisappearance of the orbital modulation in WD 1144+011.

The\nestimated young age is consistent with the detection of strong CO emission in\nthe cluster region and the estimated large extinction of cluster members (Av ~\n4--25 mag). The observed KLF suggests that the underlying initial mass function\n(IMF) of the low-metallicity cluster is not significantly different from\ncanonical IMFs in the solar neighborhood in terms of both high-mass slope and\nIMF peak (characteristic mass).

Since most of the\nelements visible in X-rays are formed by type Ia (SNIa) and/or core-collapse\n(SNcc) supernovae, measuring their abundances gives us direct information on\nthe nucleosynthesis products of billions of SNe since the epoch of the star\nformation peak (z ~ 2-3).

We find that the Fe abundance shows a large\nscatter (~20-40%) over the sample, within 0.2$r_{500}$ and, especially,\n0.05$r_{500}$.

Core creation is\nregarded as one of the most promising solutions to potential issues faced by\nthe lambda cold dark matter (LambdaCDM) cosmology on small scales.

For four Milky Way-mass simulations, each\nrun both as dark matter-only and with baryons included, we are able to identify\na planar configuration that significantly maximizes the number of plane\nsatellite members. The maximum plane member satellites are consistently\ndifferent between the dark matter-only and baryonic versions of the same run\ndue to the fact that satellites are both more likely to be destroyed and to\ninfall later in the baryonic runs. Hence, studying satellite planes in dark\nmatter-only simulations is misleading, because they will be composed of\ndifferent satellite members than those that would exist if baryons were\nincluded. Additionally, the destruction of satellites in the baryonic runs\nleads to less radially concentrated satellite distributions, a result that is\ncritical to making planes that are statistically significant compared to a\nrandom distribution. Since all planes pass through the centre of the galaxy, it\nis much harder to create a plane from a random distribution if the satellites\nhave a low radial concentration.

The global\nnature of the collapse implies that the SFR increases over time. The\nhierarchical nature of the collapse consists of small-scale collapses within\nlarger-scale ones. The large-scale collapses culminate a few Myr later than the\nsmall-scale ones and consist of filamentary flows that accrete onto massive\ncentral clumps. The small-scale collapses form clumps that are embedded in the\nfilaments and falling onto the large-scale collapse centers. The stars formed\nin the early, small-scale collapses share the infall motion of their parent\nclumps. Thus, the filaments feed both gaseous and stellar material to the\nmassive central clump. This leads to the presence of a few older stars in a\nregion where new protostars are forming, and also to a self-similar structure,\nin which each unit is composed of smaller-scale sub-units that approach each\nother and may merge. Because the older stars formed in the filaments share the\ninfall motion of the gas onto the central clump, they tend to have larger\nvelocities and to be distributed over larger areas than the younger stars\nformed in the central clump. Finally, interpreting the IMF at face-value as a\nprobability distribution implies that massive stars only form once the {\\it\nlocal} SFR is large enough to sample the IMF up to high masses. In combination\nwith the increase of the SFR, this implies that massive stars tend to appear\nlate in the evolution of the MC, and only in the central massive clumps.

We first show, by\nmeans of pure N-body simulations, that initially co-spatial stellar populations\nwith different in-plane random motions separate when a bar forms. The radially\ncooler populations form a strong bar, and are vertically thin and\npeanut-shaped, while the hotter populations form a weaker bar and become a\nvertically thicker box. We demonstrate that it is the radial, not the vertical,\nvelocity dispersion that dominates this evolution. Assuming that early stellar\ndiscs heat rapidly as they form, then both the in-plane and vertical random\nmotions correlate with stellar age and chemistry, leading to different density\ndistributions for metal-rich and metal-poor stars. We then use a\nhigh-resolution simulation, in which all stars form out of gas, to demonstrate\nthat this is what happens. When we apply these results to the Milky Way we show\nthat a very broad range of observed trends for ages, densities, kinematics and\nchemistries, that have been presented as evidence for contradictory paths to\nthe formation of the bulge, are in fact consistent with a bulge which formed\nfrom a continuum of disc stellar populations which were kinematically separated\nby the bar. For the first time we are able to account for the bulge's main\ntrends via a model in which the bulge formed largely in situ. Since the model\nis generic, we also predict the general appearance of stellar population maps\nof external edge-on galaxies. \n\n"}

We\nuse recent results showing that a magnetic field at the surface of a massive\nstar can significantly reduce its effective mass-loss rate to compute magnetic\nmodels of very massive stars (VMSs) at solar metallicity and explore the\npossibility that such stars end as PISNe. We implement the quenching of the\nmass loss produced by a surface dipolar magnetic field into the Geneva stellar\nevolution code and compute new stellar models with an initial mass of\n$200\\,M_\\odot$ at solar metallicity, with and without rotation. It considerably\nreduces the total amount of mass lost by the star during its life. For the\nnon-rotating model, the total (CO-core) mass of the models is $72.8\\,M_\\odot$\n($70.1\\,M_\\odot$) at the onset of the electron-positron pair-creation\ninstability. For the rotating model, we obtain $65.6\\,M_\\odot$\n($62.4\\,M\\odot$). In both cases, a significant fraction of the internal mass\nlies in the region where pair instability occurs in the $\\log(T)-\\log(\\rho)$\nplane. The interaction of the reduced mass loss with the magnetic field\nefficiently brakes the surface of the rotating model, producing a strong shear\nand hence a very efficient mixing that makes the star evolve nearly\nhomogeneously. The core characteristics of our models indicate that solar\nmetallicity models of magnetic VMSs may evolve to PISNe (and pulsation PISNe). \n\n"}

The comet is suggested\nto have approached Jupiter to 0.005 AU on -2251 November 7, in general\nconformity with Marsden's (1999) proposal of a Jovian encounter nearly 4300 yr\nago. The variations of sizable nongravitational effects with heliocentric\ndistance correlate with the evolution of outgassing, asymmetric relative to\nperihelion. The future orbital period will shorten to ~1000 yr because of\norbital-cascade resonance effects. We find that the sublimation curves of\nparent molecules are fitted with the type of a law used for the\nnongravitational acceleration, determine their orbit-integrated mass loss, and\nconclude that the share of water ice was at most 57%, and possibly less than\n50%, of the total outgassed mass.

The basic assumptions are: a) the atmosphric layers are in\nradiative equilibrium; b) the bolometric flux is anti-parallel with the\neffective gravity; c) the angular velocity in the surface is\nOmega=Omega(theta,alpha,k)] where (alpha,k) are free parameters. The effective\ntemperature varies with co-latitude `theta' and on the differential-rotation\nlaw through the effective gravity and the gravity-darkening function (GDF).\nAlthough the derived expressions can be treated numerically, for some low\ninteger values of k, analytical forms of the `integral ofcharacteristic\ncurves', on which the determination of the GDF relies, are obtained. The\neffects of the quantities (eta,alpha,k) (eta=ratio between centrifugal and\ngravitational accelerations at the equator) on the determination of the Vsini\nparameter and on the `gravity-darkening exponent' are studied. Depending on the\nvalues of (eta,alpha,k) the velocity V in the derived Vsini may strongly\ndeviate from the equatorial rotational velocity.

However, many astrophysical systems are contracting\nunder the influence of external pressure or gravity, and the balance between\ndriving and dissipation in a contracting, magnetized medium has yet to be\nstudied. In this paper we present three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamic\n(MHD) simulations of compression in a turbulent, magnetized medium that\nresembles the physical conditions inside molecular clouds. We find that in some\ncircumstances the combination of compression and magnetic fields leads to a\nrate of turbulent dissipation far less than that observed in non-magnetized\ngas, or in non-compressing magnetized gas. As a result, a compressing,\nmagnetized gas reaches an equilibrium velocity dispersion much greater than\nwould be expected for either the hydrodynamic or the non-compressing case.

However, how AGN jets heat and suppress cooling flows\nremains highly debated. Using an idealized simulation of a cool-core cluster,\nwe study the development of central cooling catastrophe and how a subsequent\npowerful AGN jet event averts cooling flows, with a focus on complex\ngasdynamical processes involved. We find that the jet drives a bow shock, which\nreverses cooling inflows and overheats inner cool core regions. The shocked gas\nmoves outward in a rarefaction wave, which rarefies the dense core and\nadiabatically transports a significant fraction of heated energy to outer\nregions. As the rarefaction wave propagates away, inflows resume in the cluster\ncore, but a trailing outflow is uplifted by the AGN bubble, preventing gas\naccumulation and catastrophic cooling in central regions.

We\nhave identified four molecular clumps, that were likely formed by the expansion\nof the ionization front, and determined some of their physical and dynamical\nproperties. Clumps having HCO+ and 870 micron counterparts show evidence of\ngravitational collapse. We identified several candidate YSOs across the\nmolecular component. Their spatial distribution, as well as the fragmentation\ntime derived for the collected layers of the molecular gas, suggest that\nmassive star formation might have been triggered by the expansion of the nebula\nvia the collect and collapse mechanism. The spectroscopical distance obtained\nfor the stellar cluster [BDS2003]6, placed over one of the collapsing clumps,\nreveals that this cluster is physically associated with the neabula and gives\nmore support to the triggered massive star formation scenario. A radio\ncontinuum data analysis indicates that the nebula is older and expands at lower\nvelocity than typical Galactic IR bubbles. \n\n"}

In this work we revisit the dissipative\nphotospheric scenario, in which the GRB prompt emission is produced around the\nphotospheric radius. Meanwhile, possible dissipation mechanisms (e.g., internal\nshocks or magnetic reconnection) could accelerate cosmic-rays (CRs) to\nultra-high energies and then produce neutrinos via hadronuclear and\nphotohadronic processes, which are referred to as prompt neutrinos. In this\npaper, we obtain the prompt neutrino spectrum of a single GRB within a\nself-consistent analytical framework, in which the jet-cocoon structure and\npossible collimation effects are included. We investigate a possible neutrino\nsignal from the cocoon, which has been ignored in the previous studies. We show\nthat if a GRB event happens at a distance of the order of Mpc, there is a great\nchance to observe the neutrino emission from the cocoon by IceCube, which is\neven more promising than jet neutrinos since the opening angle of the cocoon is\nmuch larger. We also figure out the diffuse neutrino flux of GRB cocoons and\nfind that it could be comparable with that of the jets.

For inside-out\ngrowing discs, today's thick-disc stars at R_0 are dominated by outwards\nmigrators. Whether outwards migrators are vertically hotter than non-migrators\ndepends on the radial gradient of the thick disc vertical velocity dispersion.\nThere is an effective upper boundary in angular momentum that thick disc stars\nborn in the centre of a galaxy can reach by migration, which explains the\nfading of the high-alpha sequence outside R_0.

The vertical heating of thin disc stars by giant molecular\nclouds is only mildly affected by the presence of thick discs.

It is often assumed that only very\nfew elemental abundances can be measured from such low-resolution spectra,\nlimiting their utility for Galactic archaeology studies. However, Ting et al.\n(2017) used ab initio models to argue that low-resolution spectra should enable\nprecision measurements of many elemental abundances, at least in theory.

Abstract: Recent sub-millimeter observations show non-axisymmetric brightness\ndistributions with a horseshoe-like morphology for more than a dozen transition\ndisks. The most accepted explanation for the observed asymmetries is the\naccumulation of dust in large-scale vortices. Protoplanetary disks vortices can\nform by the excitation of Rossby-wave instability in the vicinity of a steep\npressure gradient, which can develop at the edges of a giant planet carved gap\nor at the edges of an accretionally inactive zone. We studied the formation and\nevolution of vortices formed in these two distinct scenarios by means of\ntwo-dimensional locally isothermal hydrodynamic simulations. We found that the\nvortex formed at the edge of a planetary gap is short-lived, unless the disk is\nnearly inviscid. In contrast, the vortex formed at the outer edge of a dead\nzone is long-lived. The vortex morphology can be significantly different in the\ntwo scenarios: the vortex radial and azimuthal extensions are ~1.5 and ~3.5\ntimes larger for the dead zone edge compared to gap models. In some particular\ncases, the vortex aspect ratios can be similar in the two scenarios, however,\nthe vortex azimuthal extensions can be used to distinguish the vortex formation\nmechanisms. We calculate predictions for vortex observability in the\nsub-millimeter continuum with ALMA. We found that the azimuthal and radial\nextent of brightness asymmetry correlates with vortex formation process, within\nthe limitations of alpha-viscosity prescription. \n\n"}

Prominent, narrow\nemission lines of H and He are superposed on the continuum. Subsequent\nevolution revealed that the SN ejecta are interacting with the CSM. The initial\nSN Ic identification was confirmed by removing the CSM interaction component\nfrom the spectrum and comparing with known SNe Ic, and reversely, adding a CSM\ninteraction component to the spectra of known SNe Ic and comparing them to SN\n2017dio. Excellent agreement was obtained with both procedures, reinforcing the\nSN Ic classification. The light curve constrains the pre-interaction SN Ic peak\nabsolute magnitude to be around $M_g = -17.6$ mag. No evidence of significant\nextinction is found, ruling out a brighter luminosity required by a SN Ia\nclassification. These pieces of evidence support the view that SN 2017dio is a\nSN Ic, and therefore the first firm case of a SN Ic with signatures of\nhydrogen-rich CSM in the early spectrum.

The main insight from this study is\nthat LTG bulges form a continuous sequence of increasing dmB with increasing\nM*T, M*B, stellar mass surface density S* and mass-weighted age and\nmetallicity: high-dmB bulges are the oldest, densest and most massive ones, and\nvice versa. Furthermore, we find that the bulge-to-disk age and metallicity\ncontrast, as well as the bulge-to-disk mass ratio increase with M*T, raising\nfrom, respectively, ~0 Gyr, 0 dex and 0.25 to ~3 Gyr, ~0.3 dex and 0.67 across\nthe mass range covered by our sample. Whereas gas excitation in lower-mass\nbulges is invariably dominated by star formation (SF), LINER- and\nSeyfert-specific emission-line ratios were exclusively documented in high-mass,\nhigh-S* bulges. The continuity both in the properties of LTG bulges themselves\nand in their age and metallicity contrast to their parent disks suggests that\nthese components evolve alongside in a concurrent process that leads to a\ncontinuum of physical and evolutionary characteristics. Our results are\nconsistent with a picture where bulge growth in LTGs is driven by a\nsuperposition of quick-early and slow-secular processes, the relative\nimportance of which increases with M*T. These processes, which presumably\ncombine in situ SF in the bulge and inward migration of material from the disk,\nare expected to lead to a non-homologous radial growth of S* and a trend for an\nincreasing Sersic index with increasing galaxy mass. \n\n"}

Unlike most other\nwork, we use a model-free approach based on the relative polar image angles of\nquads, and their position in 3D space with respect to the Fundamental Surface\nof Quads. The FSQ is defined by quads produced by elliptical lenses. We have\ngenerated thousands of quads from synthetic populations of lenses with\nsubstructure consistent with $\\Lambda$CDM simulations, and found that such\nperturbations are not sufficient to match the observed distribution of quads\nrelative to the FSQ. The result is unchanged even when subhalo masses are\nincreased by a factor of ten, and the most optimistic lensing selection bias is\napplied. We then produce quads from galaxies created using two components,\nrepresenting baryons and dark matter. The transition from the mass being\ndominated by baryons in inner radii to being dominated by dark matter in outer\nradii can carry with it asymmetries, which would affect relative image angles.\nWe run preliminary experiments using lenses with two elliptical mass components\nwith nonidentical axis ratios and position angles, perturbations from\nellipticity in the form of nonzero Fourier coefficients $a_4$ and $a_6$, and\nartificially offset ellipse centers as a proxy for asymmetry at image radii.

We prove analytically this density\nprofile is the result of the scale-free nature of the gravitational collapse.\nTherefore, it should emerge in many different situations as long as gravity is\ndominating the evolution for a period that is comparable or longer than the\nfree-fall time, and this does not necessarily imply an isothermal model, as\nmany have previously believed.\n  To describe the collapse process, we construct a model called the\nturbulence-regulated gravitational collapse model, where turbulence is\nsustained by accretion and dissipates in roughly a crossing time. We\ndemonstrate that a $\\rho \\sim r^{-2}$ profile emerges due to the scale-free\nnature the system. In this particular case, the rate of gravitational collapse\nis regulated by the rate at which turbulence dissipates the kinetic energy such\nthat the infall speed can be $20 - 50 \\%$ of the free-fall speed(which also\ndepends on the interpretation of the crossing time based on simulations of\ndriven turbulence).

The cluster is undergoing a violent merger involving at\nleast four sub-clusters, and it is known to host a radio halo.

We use deep GMRT observations at 608 MHz to\nconstrain the spectral indices of these new radio sources, and of the emission\nthat was already studied in the literature at higher frequency. We find that\nthe spectrum of the radio halo and of the relic at LOFAR frequency follows the\nsame power law as observed at higher frequencies. The radio bridge, the radio\narc, and the radio bar all have steep spectra, which can be used to constrain\nthe particle acceleration mechanisms. We argue that the radio bridge could be\ncaused by the re-acceleration of electrons by shock waves that are injected\nalong the filament during the cluster mass assembly. Despite the sensitivity\nreached by our observations, the emission from the radio halo does not trace\nthe emission of the gas revealed by X-ray observations.

It seems possible that\nthe proposed mechanism acting in individual giant molecular clouds may produce\nsignificant abundance effects for masses corresponding to single stars or small\ngroups of stars.

The most updated AGN physics, namely the\ndiscrimination of cold and hot accretion modes and the exact descriptions of\nthe AGN radiation and wind for a given accretion rate are adopted and their\ninteraction with the gas in the host galaxy is calculated.

Using the IRAM NOrthern Extended\nMillimeter Array (NOEMA) and the IRAM 30-m telescope, the CORE survey has\nobtained high-resolution observations of 20 well-known highly luminous\nstar-forming regions in the 1.37 mm wavelength regime in both line and dust\ncontinuum emission. We present the spectral line setup of the CORE survey and a\ncase study for W3(H2O). At ~0.35\" (700 AU at 2 kpc) resolution, the W3(H2O)\nclump fragments into two cores (West and East), separated by ~2300 AU. Velocity\nshifts of a few km/s are observed in the dense-gas tracer, CH3CN, across both\ncores, consistent with rotation and perpendicular to the directions of two\nbipolar outflows, one emanating from each core. The kinematics of the rotating\nstructure about W3(H2O) W shows signs of differential rotation of material,\npossibly in a disk-like object. The observed rotational signature around\nW3(H2O) E may be due to a disk-like object, an unresolved binary (or multiple)\nsystem, or a combination of both. We fit the emission of CH3CN (12-11) K = 4-6\nand derive a gas temperature map with a median temperature of ~165 K across\nW3(H2O).

However, the fundamental properties of M dwarfs\nare difficult to constrain, often limiting our ability to characterise the\nplanets they host. Here we test several theoretical relationships for M dwarfs\nby measuring 23 high precision, model-independent masses and radii for M dwarfs\nin binaries with white dwarfs.

While radio bubbles inflated by AGN jets\ncould be dynamically supported by cosmic rays (CRs), the impact of CR-dominated\njets are not well understood. In this work, we perform three-dimensional\nsimulations of CR-jet feedback in an isolated cluster atmosphere; we find that\nCR jets impact the multiphase gas differently than jets dominated by kinetic\nenergy. In particular, CR bubbles can more efficiently uplift the cluster gas\nand cause an outward expansion of the hot ICM. Due to adiabatic cooling from\nthe expansion and less efficient heating from CR bubbles by direct mixing, the\nICM is more prone to local thermal instabilities, which will later enhance\nchaotic cold accretion onto the AGN. The amount of cold gas formed during the\nbubble formation and its late-time evolution sensitively depend on whether CR\ntransport processes are included or not.

Older clusters tend to be more concentrated than younger clusters.\nTheir structure, represented by the characteristic radius $r_s$ and mass $M_s$\nof the Navarro--Frenk--White (NFW) density profile, is related to their\nformation time. In~this study, we showed that $r_s$, $M_s$, and the X-ray\ntemperature of the intracluster medium (ICM), $T_X$, form a thin plane in the\nspace of $(\\log r_s, \\log M_s, \\log T_X)$. This tight correlation indicates\nthat the ICM temperature is also determined by the formation time of individual\nclusters. Numerical simulations showed that clusters move along the fundamental\nplane as they evolve. The plane and the cluster evolution within the plane\ncould be explained by a similarity solution of structure formation of the\nuniverse. The angle of the plane shows that clusters have not achieved \"virial\nequilibrium\" in the sense that mass/size growth and pressure at the boundaries\ncannot be ignored. The distribution of clusters on the plane was related to the\nintrinsic scatter in the halo concentration--mass relation, which originated\nfrom the variety of cluster ages. The well-known mass--temperature relation of\nclusters ($M_\\Delta\\propto T_X^{3/2}$) can be explained by the fundamental\nplane and the mass dependence of the halo concentration without the assumption\nof virial equilibrium. The fundamental plane could also be used for calibration\nof cluster masses. \n\n"}

We improve the Dense Basis SFH reconstruction method of\nIyer & Gawiser (2017), introducing a nonparametric description of the SFH based\non the lookback times at which a galaxy assembles certain quantiles of its\nstellar mass. The method uses Gaussian Processes to create smooth SFHs that are\nindependent of any functional form, with a flexible number of parameters that\nis adjusted to extract the maximum possible amount of SFH information from the\nSEDs being fit. We apply the method to reconstruct the SFHs of 48,791 galaxies\nwith $H<25$ at $0.5 < z < 3.0$ across the five CANDELS fields. Using these\nSFHs, we study the evolution of galaxies as they grow more massive over cosmic\ntime. We quantify the fraction of galaxies that show multiple major episodes of\nstar formation, finding that the median time between two peaks of star\nformation is $\\sim 0.42_{-0.10}^{+0.15}t_{univ}$ Gyr, where $t_{univ}$ is the\nage of the universe at a given redshift and remains roughly constant with\nstellar mass. Correlating SFHs with morphology, we find that studying the\nmedian SFHs of galaxies at $0.5<z<1.0$ at the same mass ($10^{10}< M_* <\n10^{10.5}M_\\odot$) allows us to compare the timescales on which the SFHs\ndecline for different morphological classifications, ranging from\n$0.60^{-0.54}_{+1.54}$ Gyr for galaxies with spiral arms to\n$2.50^{-1.50}_{+2.25}$ Gyr for spheroids. The Gaussian Process-based SFH\ndescription provides a general approach to reconstruct smooth, nonparametric\nSFH posteriors for galaxies with a flexible number of parameters that can be\nincorporated into Bayesian SED fitting codes to minimize the bias in estimating\nphysical parameters due to SFH parametrization. \n\n"}

The magnetic field helps shape and reinforce the long\nfilamentary structures.

The foreground and background stars show a spatial pattern that\ntraces the 3D structure of the nebular dust component. We derive stellar ages\nfor 382 confirmed cluster members and we find that the gravity-sensitive gamma\nindex distribution for M stars is correlated with stellar age. For all members\nwith Teff<5500 K, the mean logarithmic age is 5.84 (units of years) with a\ndispersion of 0.36 dex.

Tidal disruption of a star by\na supermassive black hole is the favored explanation of these unusual events.\n  We present a review of the previous results, a search for radio emission from\nall outbursters, based on the NVSS database, and dedicated radio observations\nof NGC 5905 carried out with the VLA. These provide important constraints on\nthe presence of an (obscured) active nucleus (AGN) at the center of each\nflaring galaxy. We rigorously explore AGN scenarios to account for the unusual\nX-ray outbursts from the optically `normal' galaxies and find AGN-related\nmodels highly unlikely.

To this\nend we examine the inferred star-formation rates in two well-studied samples of\ngalaxies as a function of redshift out to z = 10 for various best-fit and\nlimiting cases.\n  Taken at face value, the generally young ages (typically 10^8 +- 0.5 yr) of\nthe z = 3 Lyman break galaxies imply that their stars were not present much\nbeyond z=4.

Stars and galaxies form only from the cool gas fraction. Hot gas is\nejected from low-mass systems as in conventional semi-analytic models of galaxy\nformation.

Requiring the rate of stellar mass\ncapture to equal the mass accretion rate into the black hole, a relation\nbetween the black hole mass and the stellar velocity dispersion is predicted of\nthe form M_{BH} \\propto sigma_*^{30/7}. The normalization depends on various\nuncertain parameters such as the disk viscosity, but is consistent with\nobservation for reasonable assumptions. We show that a seed central black hole\nin a newly formed stellar system can grow at the Eddington rate up to this\npredicted mass via stellar captures by the accretion disk. Once this mass is\nreached, star captures are insufficient to maintain an Eddington accretion\nrate, and the quasar may naturally turn off as the accretion switches to a\nlow-efficiency advection mode. The model provides a mechanism to deliver mass\nto the accretion disk at small radius, probably solving the problem of\ngravitational instability to star formation in the disk at large radius. We\nnote that the matter from stars that is incorporated to the disk has an average\nspecific angular momentum that is very small or opposite to that of the disk,\nand discuss how a rotating disk may be maintained as it captures this matter if\na small fraction of the accreted mass comes from stellar winds that form a disk\nextending to larger radius.

As found in previous studies, the [alpha/Fe]\nratios of most stars in the dSph galaxies are generally lower than similar\nmetallicity Galactic stars in this extended sample. Our kinematically selected\nstars confirm that this is true for all major stellar components of the Galaxy,\nincluding the halo, thin disk, and thick disk. There is marginal overlap in the\nlow [alpha/Fe] ratios between dSph stars and Galactic halo stars on extreme\nretrograde orbits, but this is not supported by other element ratios, like\n[Ba/Y]. Thus, the full chemical signature of most of the dSph stars are\ndistinct from the main components of the Galaxy. This result rules out\ncontinuous merging of low mass galaxies similar to these dSph satellites during\nthe formation of the Galaxy, which is discuss further. The new environments\noffered by the dSph galaxies also allow us to examine fundamental assumptions\nrelated to nucleosynthesis. The metal-poor stars ([Fe/H] < -1.8) in the dSph\ngalaxies have [alpha/Fe] ratio that are consistent with predictions from the\nalpha-process (alpha-rich freeze out).

The discovery of afterglow emission from long GRBs was a\nwatershed event, pinpointing their origin to star forming galaxies, and hence\nthe death of massive stars, and indicating an energy release of about 10^51\nerg. While theoretical arguments suggest that short GRBs are produced in the\ncoalescence of binary compact objects (neutron stars or black holes), the\nprogenitors, energetics, and environments of these events remain elusive\ndespite recent localizations. Here we report the discovery of the first radio\nafterglow from a short burst, GRB 050724, which unambiguously associates it\nwith an elliptical galaxy at a redshift, z=0.257. We show that the burst is\npowered by the same relativistic fireball mechanism as long GRBs, with the\nejecta possibly collimated in jets, but that the total energy release is\n10-1000 times smaller. More importantly, the nature of the host galaxy\ndemonstrates that short GRBs arise from an old (>1 Gyr) stellar population,\nstrengthening earlier suggestions, and providing support for coalescing compact\nobject binaries as the progenitors. \n\n"}

Analytic expressions are\nderived and evaluated through numerical integration. Two models for the\nellipsoidal halo profiles are considered: a toy model designed to isolate the\neffects of halo shape on the clustering alone; and the realistic model of Jing\n& Suto. For equilateral k-space triangles, we show that the predictions of the\ntriaxial model are suppressed, relative to the spherical model, by roughly ~7%\nand ~4% for the two profiles respectively. The reduced bispectrum as a function\nof triangle configuration is found to be very sensitive to halo shapes on small\nscales. The generic features are that, relative to the spherical model, the\nsignal is suppressed for k-space triangles that are close to equilateral and\nboosted for configurations that are colinear. This appears to be a unique\nsignature of halo triaxiality.\n  The galaxy bispectrum is also explored. Two models for the halo occupation\ndistribution (HOD) are considered: the binomial distribution of Scoccimarro et\nal. and the Poisson satellite model of Kravtsov et al. Our predictions show\nthat the galaxy bispectrum is also sensitive to halo shapes, although relative\nto the mass, the effects are reduced. The HOD of Kravtsov et al. is found to be\nmore sensitive. This owes to the mean number of galaxies per halo being a\nsteeper function of mass in this model, hence giving stronger weight to the\nhigh mass (more triaxial) haloes. Interestingly, the functional form is not\nstrongly sensitive to the details of the HOD, but is mainly determined by the\nhalo shape. However, a combination of measurements made on different scales and\nfor different k-space triangles are sensitive to both halo shape and the HOD. \n\n"}

In\naddition, there is evidence for a morphological evolution of the populations of\nLIRGs. Above z=0.5, roughly half of all LIRGs are spiral, the\npeculiar/irregular to spiral ratio is ~0.7, and both classes span a similar\nrange of L_{IR} and M_B. At low-z, spirals account for one-third of LIRGs, the\npeculiar to spiral fraction rises to 1.3, and for a given M_B spirals tend to\nhave lower IR luminosity than peculiars. Only a few percent of LIRGs at any\nredshift are red early-type galaxies.

We now combine\nthat analytical machinery with numerics. The resulting semianalytical theory is\nthen applied to Deimos over long time scales. In parallel, we carry out a\npurely numerical integration in an inertial Cartesian frame. The results agree\nto within a small margin, for over 10 Myr, demonstrating the applicability of\nour semianalytical model over long timescales. This will enable us to employ it\nat the further steps of the project, enriching the model with the tides, the\npull of the Sun, and the planet's triaxiality. Another goal of our work was to\ncheck if the equinoctial precession predicted for a rigid Mars could have been\nsufficient to repel the orbits away from the equator. We show that for low\ninitial inclinations, the orbit inclination reckoned from the precessing\nequator of date is subject only to small variations. This is an extension, to\nnon-uniform precession given by the Colombo model, of an old result obtained by\nGoldreich (1965) for the case of uniform precession and a low initial\ninclination. However, near-polar initial inclinations may exhibit considerable\nvariations for up to +/- 10 deg in magnitude. Nevertheless, the analysis\nconfirms that an oblate planet can, indeed, afford large variations of the\nequinoctial precession over hundreds of millions of years, without repelling\nits near-equatorial satellites away from the equator of date: the satellite\ninclination oscillates but does not show a secular increase.

The\ngamma-ray light curve is marked by a soft precursor pulse some 200 s before the\nmain event; the lack of any intervening emission suggests that it is due to a\nphysical mechanism distinct from the GRB itself. The large time lag between the\nprecursor and the main emission enabled simultaneous observations in the\ngamma-ray, X-ray, and optical band-passes, something only achieved for a\nhandful of events to date. While the contemporaneous X-rays are the low-energy\ntail of the prompt emission, the optical does not directly track the gamma-ray\nflux.

The brightest\ngalaxies in the sample all rotate too slowly to account for their flattening,\nas is also observed at z=0. But the average rotation rate is higher at z=0.5\nthan locally. This may be due to a higher fraction of misclassified S0 galaxies\n(although this effect is insufficient to explain the observed strong evolution\nof the cluster S0 fraction with redshift). Alternatively, dry mergers between\nearly-type galaxies may have decreased the average rotation rate over time. It\nis unclear whether such mergers are numerous enough in clusters to explain the\nobserved trend quantitatively. Disk-disk mergers may affect the comparison\nthrough the so-called progenitor bias, but this cannot explain the direction of\nthe observed rotation-rate evolution. Additional samples are needed to\nconstrain possible environmental dependencies and cosmic variance in galaxy\nrotation rates.

We discuss several phenomena\nstemming from such instabilities, especially in weak-scale models; generically,\nthese involve energizing a resonant system so that it can evade tunneling by\ncrossing barriers classically. One possibility is a spontaneous change of phase\nfrom a lower-energy vacuum state to one of higher energy, as exemplified by an\nasymmetric double-well potential with different masses in each well. If the\nlower well is in resonance with oscillations of the potential, a system can be\ndriven resonantly to the upper well and stay there (except for tunneling) if\nthe upper well is not resonant. Another example occurs in hybrid inflation\nmodels where the Higgs field is resonant; the Higgs oscillations can be\ntransferred to electroweak (EW) gauge potentials, leading to rapid transitions\nover sphaleron barriers and consequent B+L violation. Given an appropriate\nCP-violating seed, we find that preheating can drive a time-varying condensate\nof Chern-Simons number over large spatial scales; this condensate evolves by\noscillation as well as decay into modes with shorter spatial gradients,\neventually ending up as a condensate of sphalerons. We study these examples\nnumerically and to some extent analytically.

{"id": "hep-ph/0111042", "contents": "Title: Collider versus Cosmic Ray Sensitivity to Black Hole Production Abstract: In scenarios with extra dimensions and TeV-scale quantum gravity, black holes\nare expected to be produced copiously at center-of-mass energies above the\nfundamental Planck scale. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) may thus turn into a\nfactory of black holes, at which their production and evaporation may be\nstudied in detail. But even before the LHC starts operating, the Pierre Auger\nObservatory for cosmic rays, presently under construction, has an opportunity\nto search for black hole signatures. Black hole production in the scattering of\nultrahigh energy cosmic neutrinos on nucleons in the atmosphere may initiate\nquasi-horizontal air showers far above the Standard Model rate. In this letter,\nwe compare the sensitivity of LHC and Auger to black hole production by\nstudying their respective reach in black hole production parameter space.\nMoreover, we present constraints in this parameter space from the\nnon-observation of horizontal showers by the Fly's Eye collaboration. We find\nthat if the ultrahigh energy neutrino flux is at the level expected from cosmic\nray interactions with the cosmic microwave background radiation, Auger has only\na small window of opportunity to detect black holes before the start of the\nLHC. If, on the other hand, larger ultrahigh energy neutrino fluxes on the\nlevel of the upper limit from ``hidden'' hadronic astrophysical sources are\nrealized in nature, then the first signs of black hole production may be\nobserved at Auger. Moreover, in this case, the Fly's Eye constraints, although\nmore model dependent, turn out to be competitive with other currently available\nconstraints on TeV-scale gravity which are mainly based on interactions\nassociated with Kaluza-Klein gravitons. \n\n"}

The expansion\nof the universe alone would yield a correlation length at the present epoch of\n1 AU, whereas we find that the correlation length is likely of order 100 AU,\nand cannot possibly be longer than $10^4$ AU for non-helical fields. If the\nprimordial field is strongly helical, the correlation length can be much\nlarger, but we show that even in this case it cannot exceed 100 pc.
