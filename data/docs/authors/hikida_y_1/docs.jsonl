{"id": "0704.1447", "contents": "Title: Can Gravity Probe B usefully constrain torsion gravity theories? Abstract: In most theories of gravity involving torsion, the source for torsion is the\nintrinsic spin of matter. Since the spins of fermions are normally randomly\noriented in macroscopic bodies, the torsion generated is normally negligible.\nHowever, in a recent paper, Mao et al. point out that there is a class of\ntheories in which the angular momentum of macroscopic spinning bodies generates\na significant amount of torsion. They argue that by the principle of action\nequals reaction, one would expect the angular momentum of test bodies to couple\nto a background torsion field, and therefore the precession of the GPB\ngyroscopes should be affected in these theories by the torsion generated by the\nEarth. We show that in fact the principle of action equals reaction does not\napply to these theories. We examine in detail a generalization of the\nHayashi-Shirafuji theory suggested by Mao et al. called\nEinstein-Hayashi-Shirafuji theory. There are a variety of different versions of\nthis theory, depending on the precise form of the coupling to matter chosen for\nthe torsion. We show that for any coupling to matter that is compatible with\nthe spin transport equation postulated by Mao et al., the theory has either\nghosts or an ill-posed initial value formulation. These theoretical problems\ncan be avoided by specializing the parameters of the theory and in addition\nchoosing the standard minimal coupling to matter of the torsion tensor. This\nyields a consistent theory, but one in which the action equals reaction\nprinciple is violated, and in which the angular momentum of the gyroscopes does\nnot couple to the Earth's torsion field. Thus, the Einstein-Hayashi-Shirafuji\ntheory does not predict a detectable torsion signal for Gravity Probe B. There\nmay be other torsion theories which do. \n\n"}

Abstract: In a Universe with a detectable nontrivial spatial topology the last\nscattering surface contains pairs of matching circles with the same\ndistribution of temperature fluctuations --- the so-called circles-in-the-sky.\nSearches undertaken for nearly antipodal pairs of such circles in cosmic\nmicrowave background maps have so far been unsuccessful. Previously we had\nshown that the negative outcome of such searches, if confirmed, should in\nprinciple be sufficient to exclude a detectable non-trivial spatial topology\nfor most observers in very nearly flat ($0<\\mid\\Omega_{\\text{tot}}-1\\mid\n\\lesssim10^{-5}$) (curved) universes. More recently, however, we have shown\nthat this picture is fundamentally changed if the universe turns out to be {\\it\nexactly} flat. In this case there are many potential pairs of circles with\nlarge deviations from antipodicity that have not yet been probed by existing\nsearches. Here we study under what conditions the detection of a single pair of\ncircles-in-the-sky can be used to uniquely specify the topology and the\ngeometry of the spatial section of the Universe. We show that from the\ndetection of a \\emph{single} pair of matching circles one can infer whether the\nspatial geometry is flat or not, and if so we show how to determine the\ntopology (apart from one case) of the Universe using this information. An\nimportant additional outcome of our results is that the dimensionality of the\ncircles-in-the-sky parameter space that needs to be spanned in searches for\nmatching pair of circles is reduced from six to five degrees of freedom, with a\nsignificant reduction in the necessary computational time. \n\n"}

An essential consistency constraint of the\ntheory, the strong constraint, only allows for field configurations which\ndepend on half of the coordinates of the arising doubled space.

The Wilsonian construction is generalised by promoting the\ncut-off to a functional of these collective variables. We impose three criteria\nto determine the coarse-graining. The first criterion is that the effective\nWard identities for local conservation of energy, momentum, etc. should\npreserve their standard forms, but in new scale-dependent background metric and\nsources which are functionals of the effective single trace operators. The\nsecond criterion is that the scale-evolution equations of the operators in the\nactual background metric should be state-independent, implying that the\ncollective variables should not explicitly appear in them. The final criterion\nis that the endpoint of the scale-evolution of the RG flow can be transformed\nto a fixed point corresponding to familiar non-relativistic equations with a\nfinite number of parameters, such as incompressible non-relativistic\nNavier-Stokes, under a certain universal rescaling of the scale and of the time\ncoordinate.

{"id": "1604.04911", "contents": "Title: Polonyi Inflation Abstract: Spontaneously broken supersymmetry (SUSY) and a vanishingly small\ncosmological constant imply that R symmetry must be spontaneously broken at low\nenergies. Based on this observation, we suppose that, in the sector responsible\nfor low-energy R symmetry breaking, a discrete R symmetry remains preserved at\nhigh energies and only becomes dynamically broken at relatively late times in\nthe cosmological evolution, i.e., after the dynamical breaking of SUSY. Prior\nto R symmetry breaking, the Universe is then bound to be in a quasi-de Sitter\nphase---which offers a dynamical explanation for the occurrence of cosmic\ninflation. This scenario yields a new perspective on the interplay between SUSY\nbreaking and inflation, which neatly fits into the paradigm of high-scale SUSY:\ninflation is driven by the SUSY-breaking vacuum energy density, while the\nchiral field responsible for SUSY breaking, the Polonyi field, serves as the\ninflaton. Because R symmetry is broken only after inflation, slow-roll\ninflation is not spoiled by otherwise dangerous gravitational corrections in\nsupergravity. We illustrate our idea by means of a concrete example, in which\nboth SUSY and R symmetry are broken by strong gauge dynamics and in which\nlate-time R symmetry breaking is triggered by a small inflaton field value. In\nthis model, the scales of inflation and SUSY breaking are unified; the\ninflationary predictions are similar to those of F-term hybrid inflation in\nsupergravity; reheating proceeds via gravitino decay at temperatures consistent\nwith thermal leptogenesis; and the sparticle mass spectrum follows from pure\ngravity mediation.

In the present\npaper, we describe a quantization scheme for general linear (aka. free) field\ntheories that can be seen as intermediate between traditional Fock quantization\nand full Algebraic QFT, in the sense that:\n  * it provides a constructive, explicit description of the resulting space of\nquantum states;\n  * it does not require the choice of a polarization, aka. the splitting of\nclassical solutions into positive vs. negative-frequency modes: in fact, any\nFock representation corresponding to a \"reasonable\" choice of polarization is\nnaturally embedded;\n  * it supports the implementation of a \"large enough\" class of linear\nsymplectomorphisms of the classical, infinite-dimensional phase space.\n  The proposed quantization (like Algebraic QFT) is notably meant for use on\ncurved spacetimes, where the lack of a preferred choice of polarization makes\nthe introduction of a Fock representation problematic.

Moreover, negative conductivity has been\nclaimed to occur for light bosons in moderate electric fields, and for fermions\nof any mass in electric fields below a certain threshold. Furthemore, in the\nlimit of large mass and weak electric field, the current contains terms which\nare not exponentially suppressed, contrary to the semiclassical intuition. Here\nwe explain these behaviors, showing that most of the reported negative\nconductivity is spurious. First, we show that the terms which are not\nexponentially suppressed follow precisely from the local Euler-Heisenberg\nLagrangian (suitably generalized to curved space). Thus, such terms are\nunrelated to pair creation or to the transport of electric charge. Rather, they\ncorrespond to non-linearities of the electric field (responsible in particular\nfor vacuum birefringence). The remaining contributions are exponentially\nsuppressed and correspond to the creation of Schwinger pairs. Second, we argue\nthat for light carriers the negative term in the regularized current does not\ncorrespond to a negative conductivity, but to the logarithmic running of the\nelectric coupling constant, up to the high energy Hubble scale. We conclude\nthat none of the above mentioned negative contributions can cause an\ninstability such as the spontaneous growth of an electric field in de Sitter,\nat least within the weak coupling regime.

These modes store an exponentially large number of\npatterns within a microscopic energy gap. The resulting micro-state entropy\nobeys the area-law reminiscent of a black hole entropy.

The simplest examples possess m states per site (m\\geq2),\nwith nearest-neighbor interactions with U(m) symmetry, under which the sites\ntransform alternately along the chain in the fundamental m and its conjugate\nrepresentation \\bar{m}. We find that these spin chains, even with {\\em\narbitrary} coefficients of these interactions, have a symmetry algebra A_m much\nlarger than U(m), which implies that the energy eigenstates fall into sectors\nthat for open chains (i.e., free boundary conditions) can be labeled by j=0, 1,\n>..., L, for the 2L-site chain, such that the degeneracies of all eigenvalues\nin the jth sector are generically the same and increase rapidly with j. For\nlarge j, these degeneracies are much larger than those that would be expected\nfrom the U(m) symmetry alone. The enlarged symmetry algebra A_m(2L) consists of\noperators that commute in this space of states with the Temperley-Lieb algebra\nthat is generated by the set of nearest-neighbor interaction terms; A_m(2L) is\nnot a Yangian. There are similar results for supersymmetric chains with\ngl(m+n|n) symmetry of nearest-neighbor interactions, and a richer\nrepresentation structure for closed chains (i.e., periodic boundary\nconditions). The symmetries also apply to the loop models that can be obtained\nfrom the spin chains in a spacetime or transfer matrix picture. In the loop\nlanguage, the symmetries arise because the loops cannot cross. We further\ndefine tensor products of representations (for the open chains) by joining\nchains end to end. The fusion rules for decomposing the tensor product of\nrepresentations labeled j_1 and j_2 take the same form as the Clebsch-Gordan\nseries for SU(2). This and other structures turn the symmetry algebra \\cA_m\ninto a ribbon Hopf algebra, and we show that this is ``Morita equivalent'' to\nthe quantum group U_q(sl_2) for m=q+q^{-1}.

The aspect of\nso-called ``double special relativity'' (DSR) is a starting point in our\ndiscussion. The three elementary ideas were involved to show that special\nrelativity may be treated as an integral part of quantum mechanics. These ideas\n(or observations) are: (1) the necessity of distinguishing the two time\nmeanings, namely: (i) the vital one referring to description of system\nevolution, and (ii) the frozen one, referring to energy measure by means of\ninverse time units; (2) the existence of the energy-momentum (and\ntime-distance) comparison scale in relativistic description; and (3) a\npossibility of introduction of mass by means of a light-cone frame description.\nThe resulting quantum-mechanical analysis allows us to find diagonal form of\nthe Lorentz-boost transformation matrix and thus to relate the interval\ninvariant relativity principle with the principles of quantum mechanics. The\nmanner, in which the diagonal form of the transformation matrix was found,\nshows that covariant description itself is a preferred frame description and\nthat the time that undergoes relativistic transformation rules is the frozen\ntime, whereas the vital time is the Lorentz invariant. A generalized form of\nthe Heisenberg uncertainty principle proposed by Witten (Phys. Today, Apriel\n1996), is derived.

A crucial ingredient is the appearance of the\nhierarchically small quantity exp(-<X>) which corresponds to the scale of\ngaugino condensation. Under rather general circumstances, this leads to a\nscenario of moduli stabilization, which is endowed with a hierarchy between the\nmass of the lightest modulus, the gravitino mass and the scale of the soft\nterms, m_modulus ~ <X> m_3/2 ~ <X>^2 m_soft. The `little hierarchy' <X> is\ngiven by the logarithm of the ratio of the Planck scale and the gravitino mass,\n<X> ~ log(M_Pl/m_3/2) ~ 4pi^2. This exhibits a new mediation scheme of\nsupersymmetry breakdown, called mirage mediation. We highlight the special\nproperties of the scheme, and their consequences for phenomenology and\ncosmology. \n\n"}

The results of this article are applicable for\narbitrary multipole interaction Hamiltonians $H=Q^{i_1,\\cdots i_n}J_{i_1}\\cdots\nJ_{i_n}$ and their linear combinations for spin $j=1$ systems. In particular it\nis shown that the nuclear quadrupole Hamiltonian $H=Q^{ij}J_iJ_j$ does actually\nlead to non-Abelian geometric phases for $j=1$. This system, being bosonic, is\ntime-reversal-invariant. Therefore it cannot support Abelian adiabatic\ngeometrical phases. \n\n"}

Classes (a) and (b) have no\nintersection, but the intersection of classes (a) and (c) gives a candidate for\na new supersymmetric integrable system. We demonstrate the Painlev\\'e property\nfor some simple but nontrivial reductions of this system. \n\n"}
