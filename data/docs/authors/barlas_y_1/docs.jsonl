We develop a general\nscheme for constructing composite-fermion (CF) wave functions from conformal\nfield theory. Quasiparticles at $\\nu=1/m$ are created by inserting anyonic\nvertex operators, $P_{\\frac{1}{m}}(z)$, that replace a subset of the electron\noperators in the correlator. The one-quasiparticle wave function is identical\nto the corresponding CF wave function, and the two-quasiparticle wave function\nhas correct fractional charge and statistics and is numerically almost\nidentical to the corresponding CF wave function. We further show how to exactly\nrepresent the CF wavefunctions in the Jain series $\\nu = s/(2sp+1)$ as the CFT\ncorrelators of a new type of fermionic vertex operators, $V_{p,n}(z)$,\nconstructed from $n$ free compactified bosons; these operators provide the CFT\nrepresentation of composite fermions carrying $2p$ flux quanta in the $n^{\\rm\nth}$ CF Landau level.

This effect originates from the change of the\nshape of the vortex core due to non-equilibrium effects (similar to the\nmechanism of vortex motion instability in the Larkin-Ovchinnikov theory). The\nmoving vortex creates a deficit of quasiparticles in front of its motion and an\nexcess of quasiparticles behind the core of the moving vortex. This results in\nthe appearance of a wake (region with suppressed order parameter) behind the\nvortex which attracts other vortices resulting in an effective\ndirection-dependent interaction between vortices. When the vortex velocity $v$\nreaches the critical value $v_c$ quasi-phase slip lines (lines with fast vortex\nmotion) appear which may coexist with slowly moving vortices between such\nlines.

The spin ladder is known to undergo second order\nquantum phase transitions (QPTs) at two critical values, Hc1 and Hc2, of the\nmagnetic field. There are now known examples of strongly coupled (rung exchange\ninteraction much stronger than nearest-neighbour intrachain exchange\ninteraction) organic ladder compounds in which QPTs have been experimentally\nobserved. In this paper, we investigate whether well-known bipartite\nentanglement meaures like one-site von Neumann entropy, two-site von Neumann\nentropy and concurrence develop special features close to the quantum critical\npoints. As suggested by an earlier theorem, the first derivatives of the\nmeasures with respect to magnetic field are expected to diverge as H tends to\nHc1 and Hc2. Based on numerical diagonalization data and a mapping of the\nstrongly-coupled ladder Hamiltonian onto the XXZ chain Hamiltonian, for which\nseveral analytical results are known, we find that the derivatives of the\nentanglement measures diverge as H tends to Hc2 but remain finite as H tend to\nHc1.

These include pinned states which may have dominantly\ntriangular or square correlations, a plastically flowing liquid-like phase, a\nmoving phase with hexatic correlations, flowing triangular and square states\nand a dynamic coexistence regime characterized by the complex interconversion\nof locally square and triangular regions. We locate these phases in a dynamical\nphase diagram. We demonstrate that the apparent power-law orientational\ncorrelations we obtain in our moving hexatic phase arise from circularly\naveraging an orientational correlation function with qualitatively different\nbehaviour in the longitudinal (drive) and transverse directions. The\nintermediate coexistence regime exhibits several novel properties, including\nsubstantial enhancement in the current noise, an unusual power-law spectrum of\ncurrent fluctuations and striking metastability effects. This noise arises from\nthe fluctuations of the interface separating locally square and triangular\nordered regions.

For\nsome parameters, as we lower the temperature, this transition happens before a\nfirst order transition to a new superconducting phase.

The\nelectronic band structure of the AB bilayer in the presence of spin-orbit\ncoupling and a transverse electric field is calculated from first-principles\nusing the linearized augmented plane wave method implemented in the WIEN2k\ncode. The first-principles results around the K points are fitted to a\ntight-binding model. The main conclusion is that the spin-orbit effects in\nbilayer graphene derive essentially from the single-layer spin-orbit coupling\nwhich comes almost solely from the d orbitals. The intrinsic spin-orbit\nsplitting (anticrossing) around the K points is about 24\\mu eV for the\nlow-energy valence and conduction bands, which are closest to the Fermi level,\nsimilarly as in the single layer graphene. An applied transverse electric field\nbreaks space inversion symmetry and leads to an extrinsic (also called\nBychkov-Rashba) spin-orbit splitting. This splitting is usually linearly\nproportional to the electric field. The peculiarity of graphene bilayer is that\nthe low-energy bands remain split by 24\\mu eV independently of the applied\nexternal field. The electric field, instead, opens a semiconducting band gap\nseparating these low-energy bands.

As a geometry of boundaries we\nconsider two parallel plates on which the fermion field obeys bag boundary\nconditions. Along the compact dimensions, periodicity conditions are imposed\nwith arbitrary phases. In addition, the presence of a constant gauge field is\nassumed. The nontrivial topology gives rise to an Aharonov-Bohm effect for the\nfermionic current induced by the gauge field. It is shown that the VEV of the\ncharge density vanishes and the current density has nonzero expectation values\nfor the components along compact dimensions only. The latter are periodic odd\nfunctions of the magnetic flux with the period equal to the flux quantum. In\nthe region between the plates, the VEV of the fermionic current is decomposed\ninto pure topological, single plate and interference parts.

When the\ntwo superconductors gap out the edge modes, the system has a topological ground\nstate degeneracy in the thermodynamic limit akin to the fractional quantum Hall\ndegeneracy on a torus. In the quasi-one-dimensional limit, where the width of\nthe insulator becomes small, the ground state energies are split.

Tewari et al.,\narXiv:1503.05057v1], where the suppression of phase coherence of a\nsingle-electron wave packet created at the edge of a quantum Hall (QH) system\nat filling factor 2 has been investigated with the help of an electronic\nMach-Zehnder (MZ) interferometer. The authors of the experiment have observed\nan unexpected behavior of phase coherence, that saturates at high energies\ninstead of vanishing, presumably suggesting the relaxation of a wave packet to\nthe ground state before it arrives to the MZ interferometer. Here, we\ntheoretically investigate this situation using the model of edge states [I. P.\nLevkivskyi, E. V. Sukhorukov, Phys. Rev. B 78, 045322 (2008)], which accounts\nfor the strong Coulomb interaction between the two electron channels at the\nedge of a QH system. We conclude that the observed phenomenon cannot be\nexplained within this model for the reason that under an assumption of\nlinearity of the electron spectrum at low energies the system remains\nintegrable in terms of the collective charge excitations, and therefore full\nrelaxation to the ground state is not possible, despite strong interactions. As\na result, the degree of the phase coherence decreases with energy of the\ninitial state in a power-law manner. Since this does not happen in the\nexperiment, a new physical phenomenon may take place at the edge of a QH state,\nwhich deserves further investigations.

The phase\ntransition occurs when the disorder renormalizes the topological mass, thereby\nreducing the Fermi velocity near the Weyl cone below the tilt of the cone. We\nalso confirm the presence of the disorder induced phase transition in Weyl\nsemimetals using exact diagonalization of a three-dimensional tight-binding\nmodel to calculate the resultant phase diagram of the type-I Weyl semimetal. \n\n"}

{"id": "hep-th/0505087", "contents": "Title: Geometric phases and hidden local gauge symmetry Abstract: The analysis of geometric phases associated with level crossing is reduced to\nthe familiar diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in the second quantized\nformulation. A hidden local gauge symmetry, which is associated with the\narbitrariness of the phase choice of a complete orthonormal basis set, becomes\nexplicit in this formulation (in particular, in the adiabatic approximation)\nand specifies physical observables. The choice of a basis set which specifies\nthe coordinate in the functional space is arbitrary in the second quantization,\nand a sub-class of coordinate transformations, which keeps the form of the\naction invariant, is recognized as the gauge symmetry. We discuss the\nimplications of this hidden local gauge symmetry in detail by analyzing\ngeometric phases for cyclic and noncyclic evolutions. It is shown that the\nhidden local symmetry provides a basic concept alternative to the notion of\nholonomy to analyze geometric phases and that the analysis based on the hidden\nlocal gauge symmetry leads to results consistent with the general prescription\nof Pancharatnam. We however note an important difference between the geometric\nphases for cyclic and noncyclic evolutions. We also explain a basic difference\nbetween our hidden local gauge symmetry and a gauge symmetry (or equivalence\nclass) used by Aharonov and Anandan in their definition of generalized\ngeometric phases. \n\n"}

{"id": "quant-ph/0501067", "contents": "Title: A comparative analysis of tunneling time concepts: Where do transmitted\n  particles start from, on the average? Abstract: In this paper we compare the concept of the tunneling time introduced in\nquant-ph/0405028 with those of the phase and dwell times. As is shown, unlike\nthe latter our definition of the transmission time coincides, in the limit of\nweak scattering potentials, with that for a free particle. This is valid for\nall values of the particle's momentum, including the case of however slow\nparticles. All three times are also considered for a resonant tunneling. In all\nthe cases the main feature to distinguish our concept from others is that the\naverage starting point of transmitted (reflected) particles does not coincide\nwith that of all particles. One has to stress here that there is no such an\nexperiment which would give coordinates of all the three points,\nsimultaneously. For measuring the position of the average starting point of\ntransmitted particles we propose an experimental scheme based on the Larmor\nprecession effect. \n\n"}
