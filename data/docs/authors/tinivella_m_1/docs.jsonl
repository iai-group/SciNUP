We find that this is indeed the\ncase, albeit for a smaller region of parameter space than for gamma rays;\nselecting models with a small mass difference between the neutralino and\nsleptons, like in the stau coannihilation region in mSUGRA, the effect becomes\nmore pronounced. The resulting, rather hard positron spectrum with a relatively\nsharp cutoff may potentially fit the rising positron ratio measured by the\nPAMELA satellite.

Signals from WMAP and EGRET reinforce this interpretation. Taken\ntogether, we argue these facts imply the presence of a GeV-scale new force in\nthe dark sector. The long range allows a Sommerfeld enhancement to boost the\nannihilation cross section as required, without altering the weak scale\nannihilation cross section during dark matter freezeout in the early universe.\nIf the dark matter annihilates into the new force carrier, phi, its low mass\ncan force it to decay dominantly into leptons. If the force carrier is a\nnon-Abelian gauge boson, the dark matter is part of a multiplet of states, and\nsplittings between these states are naturally generated with size alpha m_phi ~\nMeV, leading to the eXciting dark matter (XDM) scenario previously proposed to\nexplain the positron annihilation in the galactic center observed by the\nINTEGRAL satellite.

Similarly, we observe H2 absorption\nvia the Lyman-Werner bands and estimate N(H2) = 10^21.2 cm^-2 with T_ex^H2 =\n10--300K. The afterglow photometry suggests an extinction law with R_V=4 and\nA_V=3.2 mag and requires the presence of a modest 2175A bump.

Despite the early comprehension of the\nbasic emission mechanism, their spectral energy distribution is generally\ndescribed by phenomenological or simplified models. We propose a study of the\nspectral emission from the high mass X-ray binary pulsar 4U 0115+634 by means\nof thermal and bulk Comptonization models based on the physical properties of\nsuch objects. For this purpose, we analyze the BeppoSAX data in the energy\nrange 0.7-100 keV of the 1999 giant outburst, 12 days after the maximum. We\nmodel the spectral energy distribution of the system using a two-component\ncontinuum. At higher energy, above ~7 keV, the emission is due to thermal and\nbulk Comptonization of the seed photons produced by cyclotron cooling of the\naccretion column, and at lower energy, the emission is due to thermal\nComptonization of a blackbody source in a diffuse halo close to the stellar\nsurface.

The dark matter is (mainly) the neutral W boson\nsuperpartner, the wino with mass below 200 GeV. Using the program GALPROP we\nstudy the annihilation products and backgrounds together. Antimatter and gammas\nfrom annihilating winos contribute below this energy. We explain why PAMELA\ndata does not imply no antiproton signal was observed by PAMELA or earlier\nexperiments, and explain why the antiproton analysis was misunderstood by\nearlier papers. Wino annihilation does not describe the Fermi e+ + e- data\n(except partially below ~ 100 GeV). At higher energies we expect astrophysical\nmechanisms, and we simply parameterize them so the combination can describe all\nthe data. We emphasize several predictions for satellite data to test the wino\ninterpretation, particularly the turndown of the positron and antiproton\nspectra above 100 GeV.

We make an extensive search for such a feature. Twenty\noptically selected GRBs and 12 X-ray selected GRBs are found, among which 17\noptically selected GRBs and 2 X-ray-selected GRBs have redshift measurements.\nWe fit the lightcurves with a smooth broken power-law and measure the temporal\ncharacteristic timescales of the bumps at FWHM. Strong mutual correlations\namong these timescales are found, and a dimmer and broader bump tends to peak\nat a later peak time. The ratio of rising to decaying timescales is almost\nuniversal among bursts, but the ratio of the rising time to the peak time\nvaries from 0.3~1. The E_iso is tightly correlated with the peak luminosity and\nthe peak time of the bump in the burst frame. Assuming that the bumps signal\nthe deceleration of the GRB fireballs in a constant density medium, we\ncalculate the initial Lorentz factor (Gamma_0) and the deceleration radius\n(R_dec) of the GRBs in the optical-selected sample. It is found that Gamma_0\nare typically a few hundreds, and the typical deceleration radius is\nR_dec~10^{17} cm. More intriguingly, a tight correlation between the Gamma_0\nand E_iso is found, namely Gamma_0 ~ 195 E_iso, 52}^{0.27} (satisfied for both\nthe optical and X-ray z-known samples). It is helpful to understand GRB\nphysics, and may serve as an indicator of Gamma_0.

The campaign consists of 7 observations. We analyze the\nresponse in the opacity of the gas that forms the ionized absorber to ionizing\nflux variations. Despite variations by a factor of 4 in the impinging\ncontinuum, the soft X-ray spectra of the source show little spectral\nvariations, suggesting no response from the ionized absorber. A detailed time\nmodeling confirms the lack of opacity variations for an absorbing component\nwith high ionization. Instead, the models tentatively suggest that the\nionization parameter of a low ionization absorbing component might be changing\nwith the ionizing flux, as expected for gas in photoionization equilibrium.\nUsing the lack of variations, we set an upper limit of n_e <2.0E7 cm-3 for the\nelectron density of the gas forming the high ionization, high velocity\ncomponent. This implies a large distance from the continuum source (R > 0.033\npc). If the variations in the low ionization component are real, they imply n_e\n>9.8E4 cm-3 and R < 3 pc. We discuss our results in terms of two different\nscenarios: a large scale outflow originating in the inner parts of the\naccretion disk, or a thermally driven wind originating much farther out. Given\nthe large distance of the wind, the implied mass outflow rate is also large (Mw\n> 0.08 Maccr). The associated total kinetic energy deployed by the wind in the\nhost galaxy (>1.2E56 erg) can be enough to disrupt the interstellar medium,\npossibly regulating large scale star formation. The total mass and energy\nejected by the wind is still lower than the one required for cosmic feedback,\neven when extrapolated to quasar luminosities.

As a result, the surface temperature of the star can become\nsignificantly higher than it is in the normal state resulting from\nthermonuclear burning.

While independent explanations can be\nresponsible for these phenomena, we explore the possibility of their common\nGRB-related origin by modeling the GRB distribution and estimating the rates.\nFor an expected Milky Way long GRB rate, neither of the two signals is generic;\nthe local excess requires a 2% coincidence, while the signal from the galactic\ncenter requires a 20% coincidence with respect to the timing of the latest GRB.\nThe simultaneous explanation requires a 0.4% coincidence. Considering the large\nnumber of statistical \"trials\" created by multiple searches for new physics,\nthe coincidences of a few per cent cannot be dismissed as unlikely.\nAlternatively, both phenomena can be explained by GRBs if the galactic rate is\nhigher than expected.

In this\npaper we investigate how the properties of such shells influence the SN\nlightcurve by conducting numerical simulations of the interaction between an\nexpanding SN and a circumstellar shell ejected a few years prior to core\ncollapse. Our parameter study explores how the emergent luminosity depends on a\nrange of circumstellar shell masses, velocities, geometries, and wind mass-loss\nrates, as well as variations in the SN mass and energy. We find that the shell\nmass is the most important parameter, in the sense that higher shell masses (or\nhigher ratios of M_shell/M_SN) lead to higher peak luminosities and higher\nefficiencies in converting shock energy into visual light. Lower mass shells\ncan also cause high peak luminosities if the shell is slow or if the SN ejecta\nare very fast, but only for a short time. Sustaining a high luminosity for\ndurations of more than 100 days requires massive circumstellar shells of order\n10 M_sun or more.

I consider here the implications of the\nheavier composition on the sources of UHECRs. The smaller magnetic rigidity\nimplies that nuclei UHECRs are: (i) More easily accelerated (ii) Local, as they\ncan diffuse only a few Mpc from their sources before disintegrating (iii)\nIsotropic, because large deflections in the extra galactic and the galactic\nmagnetic fields erase the directional information.

Furthermore, X-ray\npolarimetry across a broad photon energy range may independently verify the\nmisalignment between the ionisation cones and the axis of the torus.

We carry out simulations without and with radiative heating by a\ncentral X-ray corona and radiative cooling. For an adiabatic case, the radial\nprofiles of hydrodynamical properties match the Bondi solution, except near the\ninner and outer radius of the computational domain. We find that adiabatic\nBondi accretion can be reproduced for durations of a few dynamical times at the\nBondi radius, and for longer times if the outer radius is increased. With\nradiative heating and cooling included, the spherically accreting gas takes a\nlonger time to reach a steady-state than the adiabatic Bondi accretion runs,\nand in some cases does not reach a steady-state even within several hundred\ndynamical times. We find that artificial viscosity in the GADGET code causes\nexcessive heating near the inner radius, making the thermal properties of the\ngas inconsistent with a physical solution.

Using\naxisymmetric hydrodynamic simulations with a self-consistent treatment of the\ndynamical cosmic ray (CR) - gas interaction, we show that the bubbles can be\ncreated with a recent active galactic nucleus (AGN) jet activity about 1 - 3\nMyr ago, which was active for a duration of ~ 0.1 - 0.5 Myr. The bipolar jets\nwere ejected into the Galactic halo along the rotation axis of the Galaxy. Near\nthe GC, the jets must be moderately light with a typical density contrast 0.001\n<~ \\eta <~ 0.1 relative to the ambient hot gas. The jets are energetically\ndominated by kinetic energy, and over-pressured with either CR or thermal\npressure which induces lateral jet expansion, creating fat CR bubbles as\nobserved.

In galaxies\nwith sigma_c<200 km/s, the T's are close to a fiducial average temperature for\nthe gas when in outflow; at 200<sigma_c (km/s)<250, the T's are generally lower\nthan this, and unrelated with sigma_c, which requires a more complex gas flow\nstatus; at larger sigma_c, the T's may increase as sigma_c^2, as expected for\ninfall heating, though heating from SNIa's, independent of sigma_c, should be\ndominant. All observed T's are larger than the virial temperature, by up to\n~0.5 keV. This additional heating can be provided in the X-ray brightest\ngalaxies by SNIa's and infall heating, with a SNIa's energy input even lower\nthan in standard assumptions; in the X-ray fainter ones it can be provided by\nSNIa's, whose energy input would be required close to the full standard value\nat the largest sigma_c. This same energy input, though, would produce\ntemperatures larger than observed at low sigma_c, if entirely thermalized. The\nvalues of the observed T's increase from outflows to inflows; the gas is\nrelatively hotter in outflows, though, if the T's are rescaled by the virial\ntemperature. For 200<sigma_c(km/s)<250, lower L_X values tend to correspond to\nlower T's, which deserves further investigation. \n\n"}

The absence of\nthis emission from bright TeV blazars has been used to constrain the\nintergalactic magnetic field (IGMF), and the stringent limits placed upon the\nunresolved extragalactic gamma-ray background (EGRB) by Fermi has been used to\nargue against a large number of such objects at high redshifts. However, these\nare predicated upon the assumption that inverse-Compton scattering is the\nprimary energy-loss mechanism for the ultra-relativistic pairs produced by the\nannihilation of the energetic gamma rays on extragalactic background light\nphotons. Here we show that for sufficiently bright TeV sources\n(isotropic-equivalent luminosities >10^{42} erg/s) plasma beam instabilities,\nspecifically the \"oblique\" instability, present a plausible mechanism by which\nthe energy of these pairs can be dissipated locally, heating the intergalactic\nmedium. Since these instabilities typically grow on timescales short in\ncomparison to the inverse-Compton cooling rate, they necessarily suppress the\ninverse-Compton cascades. As a consequence, this places a severe constraint\nupon efforts to limit the IGMF from the lack of a discernible GeV bump in TeV\nsources. Similarly, it considerably weakens the Fermi limits upon the evolution\nof blazar populations. Specifically, we construct a TeV-blazar luminosity\nfunction from those objects presently observed and find that it is very well\ndescribed by the quasar luminosity function at z~0.1, shifted to lower\nluminosities and number densities, suggesting that both classes of sources are\nregulated by similar processes. Extending this relationship to higher\nredshifts, we show that the magnitude and shape of the EGRB above ~10 GeV is\nnaturally reproduced with this particular example of a rapidly evolving\nTeV-blazar luminosity function. \n\n"}

Their feeble interaction, however, makes them extremely\ndifficult to detect. The years 2008-2010 have witnessed remarkable steps in\ndeveloping high energy neutrino telescopes.

This implies that X-ray variability can be\nused as an accurate tool to measure MBH and this method is more accurate than\nthe ones based on single epoch optical spectra. The excess variance vs.\naccretion rate dependence is weaker than expected based on the PSD break\nfrequency scaling, suggesting that both the PSD high frequency break and the\nnormalisation depend on accretion rate in such a way that they almost\ncompletely counterbalance each other.

An important question is\nwhether the distribution of arrival directions for such UHECR nuclei can\nexhibit observable anisotropy or positional correlations with their\nastrophysical source objects despite the expected strong deflections by\nintervening magnetic fields. For this purpose, we have simulated the\npropagation of UHECR nuclei including models for both the extragalactic\nmagnetic field and the Galactic magnetic field. Assuming that only iron nuclei\nare injected steadily from sources with equal luminosity and spatially\ndistributed according to the observed large scale structure in the local\nUniverse, at the number of events published by the PAO so far, the arrival\ndistribution of UHECRs would be consistent with no auto-correlation at 95%\nconfidence if the mean number density of UHECR sources $n_s >~ 10^{-6}$\nMpc$^{-3}$, and consistent with no cross-correlation with sources within 95%\nerrors for $n_s >~ 10^{-5}$ Mpc$^{-3}$.

Compared to previous experiments, PAMELA extends the energy range\nof antiproton measurements and provides significantly higher statistics. The\nderived antiproton flux and antiproton-to-proton flux ratio are consistent with\nprevious measurements and generally considered to be produced as secondary\nproducts when cosmic ray protons and helium nuclei interact with the\ninterstellar medium.\n  To constrain cosmic ray acceleration and propagation models, the antiproton\ndata measured by PAMELA were further used together with the proton spectrum\nreported by PAMELA, as well as the B/C data provided by other experiments.\nStatistical tools were interfaced with the cosmic ray propagation package\nGALPROP to perform the constraining analyses. Diffusion models with a linear\ndiffusion coefficient and modified diffusion models with a low energy\ndependence of the diffusion coefficient were studied in the $\\chi^{2}$ study.\nUncertainties on the parameters and the goodness of fit of each model were\ngiven. Some models are further studied using the Bayesian inference. Posterior\nmeans and errors of the parameters base on our prior knowledge on them were\nobtained in the Bayesian framework. This method also allowed us to understand\nthe correlation between parameters and compare models. \n\n"}

Ultra-violet (UV) emission from a quasar is normally\nfree from the contamination from its host galaxy. Polarization fraction of the\nquasar's disc emission can therefore be determined by comparing total UV\nemission with polarized visible to near-infrared (NIR) emission; and the\nresulting continuum spectrum from UV to infrared can reveal the theoretically\nexpected Balmer edge absorption feature.

The physical\nparameters of the model - proton injection rate, electron-to-proton ratio and\ndownstream magnetic field strength - are determined through a fit of the result\nto the observed spatially-integrated synchrotron emission properties. The only\nremaining unknown astronomical parameter, the circumstellar gas number density,\nis determined by a normalization of the amplitude of the gamma-ray flux to the\nobserved amplitude. The bipolar morphology of both nonthermal X-ray and\ngamma-ray emissions is explained by the preferential injection of suprathermal\nnuclei and subsequent magnetic field amplification in the quasi-parallel\nregions of the outer supernova shock. The above parameters provide an improved\nfit to all existing nonthermal emission data, including the TeV emission\nspectrum recently detected by H.E.S.S., with the circumstellar hydrogen gas\nnumber density $N_H\\approx 0.06 cm^{-3}$ close to values derived from\nobservations of thermal X-rays.

In particular, we show that\nthe radial profiles of median gas properties are smooth and do not exhibit\nfluctuations at locations of massive clumps in contrast to mean and mode\nproperties. It is shown that distribution of gas properties in a given radial\nshell can be well described by a log-normal PDF and a tail. The former\ncorresponds to a nearly hydrostatic bulk component, accounting for ~99% of the\nvolume, while the tail corresponds to high density inhomogeneities. We show\nthat this results in a simple and robust separation of the diffuse and clumpy\ncomponents of the ICM. The FWHM of the density distribution grows with radius\nand varies from ~0.15 dex in cluster centre to ~0.5 dex at 2r_500 in relaxed\nclusters.

Outside the eclipse,\nthe source luminosity is around a few 1E34erg/s. The X-ray spectrum can be fit\nwith an absorbed power law together with a neutral iron emission line at 6.4\nkeV. The column density is constant at 1E23 cm-2 outside the X-ray eclipse.\nDuring the eclipse it is lower, consistent with a scattering origin for the low\nX-ray emission during the eclipse by the supergiant companion wind. The\nscattered X-ray emission during the X-ray eclipse is used to directly probe the\ndensity of the companion wind at the orbital separation, resulting in 7E-14\ng/cm3, which translates into a ratio Mdot_w/v_terminal = 7E-17 solar masses/km\nof the wind mass loss rate to the wind terminal velocity. This ratio, assuming\nreasonable terminal velocities in the range 500-3000 km/s, translates into an\naccretion luminosity two orders of magnitude higher than that observed.

Though very popular and robust, this conjecture still needs a\nconclusive proof. The strongest support to this idea is probably the fact that\nsupernova remnants are observed in gamma-rays, which are indeed expected as the\nresult of the hadronic interactions between the cosmic rays accelerated at the\nshock and the ambient gas. However, also leptonic processes can, in most cases,\nexplain the observed gamma-ray emission. This implies that the detections in\ngamma rays do not necessarily mean that supernova remnants accelerate cosmic\nray protons. To overcome this degeneracy, the multi-wavelength emission (from\nradio to gamma rays) from individual supernova remnants has been studied and in\na few cases it has been possible to ascribe the gamma-ray emission to one of\nthe two processes (hadronic or leptonic). Here we adopt a different approach\nand, instead of a case-by-case study we aim for a population study and we\ncompute the number of supernova remnants which are expected to be seen in TeV\ngamma rays above a given flux under the assumption that these objects indeed\nare the sources of cosmic rays. The predictions found here match well with\ncurrent observational results, thus providing a novel consistency check for the\nsupernova remnant paradigm for the origin of galactic cosmic rays. Moreover,\nhints are presented for the fact that particle spectra significantly steeper\nthan E^-2 are produced at supernova remnants. Finally, we expect that several\nof the supernova remnants detected by H.E.S.S. in the survey of the galactic\nplane should exhibit a gamma-ray emission dominated by hadronic processes (i.e.\nneutral pion decay). The fraction of the detected remnants for which the\nleptonic emission dominates over the hadronic one depends on the assumed values\nof the physical parameters and can be as high as roughly a half. \n\n"}

Abstract: The intrinsic X-ray emission of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) is often found to be\nabsorbed over and above the column density through our own galaxy. The extra\ncomponent is usually assumed to be due to absorbing gas lying within the host\ngalaxy of the GRB itself. There is an apparent correlation between the\nequivalent column density of hydrogen, N(H,intrinsic) (assuming it to be at the\nGRB redshift), and redshift, z, with the few z>6 GRBs showing the greatest\nintrinsic column densities. We investigate the N(H,intrinsic) - z relation\nusing a large sample of Swift GRBs, as well as active galactic nuclei (AGN) and\nquasar samples, paying particular attention to the spectral energy\ndistributions of the two highest redshift GRBs. Various possible sample biases\nand systematics that might produce such a correlation are considered, and we\nconclude that the correlation is very likely to be real. This may indicate\neither an evolutionary effect in the host galaxy properties, or a contribution\nfrom gas along the line-of-sight, in the diffuse intergalactic medium (IGM) or\nintervening absorbing clouds. Employing a more realistic model for IGM\nabsorption than in previous works, we find that this may explain much of the\nobserved opacity at z>~3 providing it is not too hot, likely between 10^5 K and\n10^6.5 K, and moderately metal enriched, Z~0.2 Z_sun. This material could\ntherefore constitute the Warm Hot Intergalactic Medium. However, a comparable\nlevel of absorption is also expected from the cumulative effect of intervening\ncold gas clouds, and given current uncertainties it is not possible to say\nwhich, if either, dominates. At lower redshifts, we conclude that gas in the\nhost galaxies must be the dominant contributor to the observed X-ray\nabsorption. \n\n"}

Eventually it becomes transparent and is\npushed to a higher Lorentz factor by a combination of the Lorentz force and\nradiation pressure. We obtain its profile, both inside and outside the fast\nmagnetosonic critical point, when the poloidal magnetic field is radial and\nmonopolar. Most of the energy flux is carried by the radiation field and the\ntoroidal magnetic field that is wound up close to the rapidly rotating engine.\nAlthough the entrained matter carries little energy, it couples the radiation\nfield to the magnetic field. Then the fast critical point is pushed inward from\ninfinity and, above a critical radiation intensity, the outflow is accelerated\nmainly by radiation pressure. We identify a distinct observational signature of\nthis hybrid outflow: a hardening of the radiation spectrum above the peak of\nthe seed photon distribution, driven by bulk Compton scattering.

One possible explanation is that the rebrightening is resulted from\nenergy injection. Here, we present a detailed numerical study of the energy\ninjection process and interpret the X-ray and optical afterglow light curves of\nGRB 081029. In our model, we have assumed two periods of energy injection, each\nwith a constant injection power. One injection starts at $2.8\\times10^{3}$ s\nand lasts for about 2500 s, with a power of $7.0\\times10^{47}$ ${\\rm erg}$\n${\\rm s^{-1}}$. This energy injection is mainly engaged to account for the\nrapid rebrightening at about 3000 s. The other injection starts at\n$8.0\\times10^{3}$ s and lasts for about 5000 s. The injection power is\n$3.5\\times10^{47}$ ${\\rm erg}$ ${\\rm s^{-1}}$. This energy injection can help\nto explain the slight rebrightening at about 10000 s. It is shown that the\nobserved optical afterglow, especially the marked rebrightening at about 3000\ns, can be well reproduced. In X-ray band, the predicted amplitude of the\nrebrightening is much shallower, which is also consistent with the observed\nX-ray afterglow light curve. It is argued that the two periods of energy\ninjection can be produced by the falling of clumpy materials onto the central\ncompact object of the burster, which leads to an enhancement of accretion and\ngives birth to a strong outflow temporarily. \n\n"}

When a star is disrupted in a bound\norbit with moderate eccentricity instead of a parabolic orbit, the temporal\nbehavior of the resulting stellar debris changes qualitatively. The debris is\ninitially all bound, returning to pericenter in a short time ~ the original\nstellar orbital timescale. The resulting fallback rate can thus be much higher\nthan the Eddington rate. Furthermore if the star is disrupted close to the\nhole, in a regime where general relativity is important, the stellar and debris\norbits display general relativistic precession. Apsidal precession can make the\ndebris stream cross itself after several orbits, likely leading to fast debris\nenergy dissipation. If the star is disrupted in an inclined orbit around a\nspinning hole, nodal precession reduces the probability of self-intersection,\nand circularization may take many dynamical timescales, delaying the onset of\nflare activity. An examination of the particle dynamics suggests that\nquasi-periodic flares with short durations, produced when the center of the\ntidal stream passes pericenter, may occur in the early-time light curve.

Abstract: Axion-Like Particles (ALPs), if exist in nature, are expected to mix with\nphotons in the presence of an external magnetic field. The energy range of\nphotons which undergo strong mixing with ALPs depends on the ALP mass, on its\ncoupling with photons as well as on the external magnetic field and particle\ndensity configurations. Recent observations of blazars by the Fermi Gamma-Ray\nSpace Telescope in the 0.1-300 GeV energy range show a break in their spectra\nin the 1-10 GeV range. We have modeled this spectral feature for the\nflat-spectrum radio quasar 3C454.3 during its November 2010 outburst, assuming\nthat a significant fraction of the gamma rays convert to ALPs in the large\nscale jet of this blazar. Using theoretically motivated models for the magnetic\nfield and particle density configurations in the kiloparsec scale jet, outside\nthe broad-line region, we find an ALP mass $m_a\\sim (1-3)\\cdot 10^{-7}$ eV and\ncoupling $g_{a\\gamma} \\sim (1-3)\\cdot 10^{-10}$ GeV$^{-1}$ after performing an\nillustrative statistical analysis of spectral data in four different epochs of\nemission. The precise values of $m_a$ and $g_{a\\gamma}$ depend weakly on the\nassumed particle density configuration and are consistent with the current\nexperimental bounds on these quantities. We apply this method and ALP\nparameters found from fitting 3C454.3 data to another flat-spectrum radio\nquasar PKS1222+216 (4C+21.35) data up to 400 GeV, as a consistency check, and\nfound good fit. We find that the ALP-photon mixing effect on the GeV spectra\nmay not be washed out for any reasonable estimate of the magnetic field in the\nintergalactic media. \n\n"}

In the radiation dominated era, PBHs are surrounded by a\nroughly homogeneous cosmic plasma which endows photons with an effective mass\nthrough the plasma frequency. In this setting, spinning PBHs are unstable to a\nspontaneous spindown through the well-known \"black-hole bomb\" mechanism. At\nlinear level, the photon density is trapped by the effective photon mass and\ngrows exponentially in time due to superradiance. As the plasma density\ndeclines due to cosmic expansion, the associated energy around PBHs is released\nand dissipated in the CMB. We evaluate the resulting spectral distortions of\nthe CMB in the redshift range 10^3 < z < 2x10^6.

If jet power is coupled to\nblack hole spin, deviations from the jet-disk correlation for a sample of AGN\ncan be used to probe the dispersion of the spin parameter within this sample.\nTo exploit this idea, we matched double-lobed radio sources from the FIRST\nsurvey to spectroscopically confirmed quasars from SDSS. We obtain 763 FR-II\nquasars with a median redshift of z=1.2 A tight correlation between the optical\nluminosity of the accretion disk and the lobe radio luminosity is observed.

As a result of the dark matter annihilations taking\nplace within such objects, the most nearby and massive subhalos could appear as\npoint-like or spatially extended gamma-ray sources, without observable\ncounterparts at other wavelengths. In this paper, we use the results of the\nAquarius simulation to predict the distribution of nearby subhalos, and compare\nthis to the characteristics of the unidentified gamma-ray sources observed by\nthe Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope. Focusing on the brightest high latitude\nsources, we use this comparison to derive limits on the dark matter\nannihilation cross section. For dark matter particles lighter than ~200 GeV,\nthe resulting limits are the strongest obtained to date, being modestly more\nstringent than those derived from observations of dwarf galaxies or the\nGalactic Center. We also derive independent limits based on the lack of\nunidentified gamma-ray sources with discernible spatial extension, but these\nlimits are a factor of ~2-10 weaker than those based on point-like subhalos.\nLastly, we note that four of the ten brightest high-latitude sources exhibit a\nsimilar spectral shape, consistent with 30-60 GeV dark matter particles\nannihilating to b quarks with an annihilation cross section on the order of\nsigma v ~ (5-10) x 10^-27 cm^3/s, or 8-10 GeV dark matter particles\nannihilating to taus with sigma v ~ (2.0-2.5) x 10^-27 cm^3/s. \n\n"}

Such a behaviour is often associated with\nthe onset and growth of the accretion column, which is believed to be the\norigin of the observed emission and the cyclotron lines.

The maximum energy of\naccelerated ions increases with time, and it is only limited by finite box size\nand run time. Acceleration is mainly efficient for parallel and quasi-parallel\nstrong shocks, where 10-20% of the bulk kinetic energy can be converted to\nenergetic particles, and becomes ineffective for quasi-perpendicular shocks.\nAlso, the generation of magnetic turbulence correlates with efficient ion\nacceleration, and vanishes for quasi-perpendicular configurations.

This could either be due to a true divergence in orbital\nperiod distributions of these two types of system, or to black hole LMXBs being\npreferentially hidden from view at short orbital periods. We explore the latter\npossibility, by investigating whether black hole LMXBs could be concealed by a\nswitch to radiatively inefficient accretion at low luminosities. The peak\nluminosity and the duration of X-ray binary outbursts are related to the disc\nradius and, hence, the orbital period. At short periods, where the peak\noutburst luminosity drops close to the threshold for radiatively inefficient\naccretion, black hole LMXBs have lower outburst luminosities, shorter outburst\ndurations and lower X-ray duty cycles than comparable neutron star systems.\nThese factors can combine to severely reduce the detection probability of short\nperiod black hole LMXBs relative to those containing neutron stars.

We considered several\nreference propagation setups; we find that models with a low (or null)\nreacceleration - tuned against light nuclei data - nicely describe both PAMELA\nleptonic and hadronic data with no need to introduce a low-energy break in the\nproton and helium spectra, as it would be required for high reacceleration\nmodels. We also compare our models with the preliminary $e^-$ and $e^+$\nabsolute spectra recently measured by AMS-02.

In\ncontrast, the spectrum of secondary positrons produced through the collisions\nof cosmic rays in the interstellar medium is predicted to fall rapidly with\nenergy, and thus is unable to account for the observed rise.

It has\npreviously been classified as a low-peaked BL Lac object based on its broadband\nemission and the absence of optical emission lines.

PMNJ1603-4904\nshows a symmetric brightness distribution at 8.4GHz on mas-scales, with the\nbrightest, and most compact component in the center of the emission region. The\nmorphology is reminiscent of a Compact Symmetric Object (CSO). Such objects\nhave been predicted to produce gamma-ray emission but have not been detected as\na class by Fermi/LAT so far.

To investigate this\ncorrelation, we use a phenomenological model that successfully describes star\nformation rates, luminosities and stellar masses of star forming galaxies,\napplying it to GRB production. We predict luminosities, stellar masses, and\nmetallicities of host galaxies depending on the metallicity bias. Our\nbest-fitting model includes a moderate metallicity bias, broadly consistent\nwith the large majority of long-duration GRBs in metal-poor environments\noriginating from collapsars (probability ~83%), but with a secondary\ncontribution (~17%) from metal-independent production channels, such as binary\nevolution. Because of the mass-metallicity relation of galaxies, the maximum\nlikelihood model predicts that the metal-independent channel becomes dominant\nat z<2, where hosts have higher metallicities and collapsars are suppressed.\nThis possibly explains why some studies find no clear evidence of a metal-bias\nbased on low-z samples. However, while metallicity predictions match\nobservations well at high redshift, there is tension with low redshift\nobservations, since a significant fraction of GRB hosts are predicted to have\n(near-)solar metallicity.

In this work we present new observations and discuss in\ndetail a method that allows us to measure the cosmic ray ionisation rate\ntowards the molecular clouds close to the W28 supernova remnant.

The CO observations\nallow us to constrain the density, temperature, and column density towards each\nobserved position, while the DCO$^+$/HCO$^+$ abundance ratios provide us with\nconstraints on the electron fraction and, consequently, on the cosmic ray\nionisation rate. Towards positions located close to the supernova remnant, we\nfind cosmic ray ionisation rates much larger ($\\gtrsim100$) than those in\nstandard galactic clouds.

The SDSS DR10 database contains a faint, red object at the\nposition of the OT, which appears slightly extended. This and other lines of\nevidence suggest that the OT is of extragalactic origin, and this faint object\nis likely the host galaxy. A sequence of optical spectra obtained with the\n9.2-m Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) between +8 and +45 days after discovery\nrevealed a hot, blue continuum with no visible spectral features.

Abstract: The analysis of gamma-ray burst (GRB) spectra with multi-component emission\nmodels has become an important part of the field.

While the existence of a blackbody-like component has\nbeen shown to be significant and not a byproduct of background fluctuations, it\nis very possible that it can be an artifact of spectral evolution of a single\ncomponent that is being poorly resolved in time. Herein, this possibility is\ntested by simulating a single component evolving in time and then folding the\nspectra through the $Fermi$ detector response to generate time-tagged event\nGamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) data. We then fit both the time integrated and\nresolved generated spectral data with a multi-component model using standard\ntools.

We have performed MHD simulations to study the spatial\ndistribution of CRp, considering the advection and diffusion of CRp in the\npresence of magnetic field. We find that a permeated zone is formed just\noutside of the contact discontinuity between winds and ISM, where the\ncollisions between CRp and thermal nuclei mainly occur. The decay of neutral\npions generated in the collisions, combined with the inverse Compton scattering\nof background soft photons by the secondary leptons generated in the collisions\nand primary CR electrons can well explain the observed gamma-ray spectral\nenergy distribution.

The sample consists of nearly 340 sources with\neither photometric (212) or spectroscopic (128) redshift in the above range.\nThe combination of deep and shallow survey fields provides a luminosity\nbaseline of three orders of magnitude, Lx(2-10keV)~1e43-1e46erg/s at z>3. We\nfollow a Bayesian approach to determine the binned AGN space density and\nexplore their evolution in a model-independent way. Our methodology accounts\nfor Poisson errors in the determination of X-ray fluxes and uncertainties in\nphotometric redshift estimates. We demonstrate that the latter is essential for\nunbiased measurement of space densities. We find that the AGN X-ray luminosity\nfunction evolves strongly between the redshift intervals z=3-4 and z=4-5. There\nis also suggestive evidence that the amplitude of this evolution is luminosity\ndependent. The space density of AGN with Lx<1e45erg/s drops by a factor of 5\nbetween the redshift intervals above, while the evolution of brighter AGN\nappears to be milder. Comparison of our X-ray luminosity function with that of\nUV/optical selected QSOs at similar redshifts shows broad agreement at bright\nluminosities, Lx>1e45erg/s. The faint-end slope of UV/optical luminosity\nfunctions however, is steeper than for X-ray selected AGN. This implies that\nthe type-I AGN fraction increases with decreasing luminosity at z>3, opposite\nto trends established at lower redshift. We also assess the significance of AGN\nin keeping the hydrogen ionised at high redshift. Our X-ray luminosity function\nyields ionising photon rate densities that are insufficient to keep the\nUniverse ionised at redshift z>4.

The X-ray spectra are best-fitted by\nabsorbed power laws with photon indices ~1.7 for the point-like and ~2.0 for\nthe extended one. Both sources show nonthermal radio-continuum counterparts\nthat might indicate a physical association. From the available data, we did not\ndetect variability on the point-like source in several timescales. Two possible\nscenarios are analyzed: first, based on HI line absorption, assuming a Galactic\norigin, we infer a distance upper bound of <2 kpc, which poses a constraint on\nthe height over the Galactic plane of <200 pc and on the linear size of the\nsystem of <2.3 pc. In this case, the X-ray luminosities are >10^32 erg/s and\n>7.5 x 10^32 erg/s, for the point-like and extended sources, respectively;\nsecond, an extra-Galactic nature is discussed, where the point-like source\nmight be the core of a radio galaxy and the extended source its lobe.

Six months of radio observations of\nthe 2012 nova V5589 Sgr with the VLA and 15 weeks of X-ray observations with\nSwift/XRT show that the radio emission consisted of: 1) a shock-powered,\nnon-thermal flare; and 2) weak thermal emission from $10^{-5}$ M$_\\odot$ of\nfreely expanding, photoionized ejecta. Absorption features in the optical\nspectrum and the peak optical brightness suggest that V5589 Sgr lies 4 kpc away\n(3.2-4.6 kpc). The shock-powered flare dominated the radio light curve at low\nfrequencies before day 100. The spectral evolution of the radio flare, its high\nradio brightness temperature, the presence of unusually hard ($kT_x > 33$ keV)\nX-rays, and the ratio of radio to X-ray flux near radio maximum all support the\nconclusions that the flare was shock-powered and non-thermal.

If NSBM are indeed solely responsible for the solar system r-\nprocess abundances, a galaxy like our own would require to host a few NSBM per\nmillion years, with each event ejecting, on average, about 5x10^{-2} M_sun of\nr-process material. Because the ejecta velocities in the tidal tail are\nsignificantly larger than in ordinary supernovae, NSBM deposit a comparable\namount of energy into the interstellar medium (ISM). In contrast to extensive\nefforts studying spherical models for supernova remnant evolution, calculations\nquantifying the impact of NSBM ejecta in the ISM have been lacking. To better\nunderstand their evolution in a cosmological context, we perform a suite of\nthree-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations with optically-thin radiative\ncooling of isolated NSBM ejecta expanding in environments with conditions\nadopted from Milky Way-like galaxy simulations.

Unexpectedly, this usually unobscured source\nappeared strongly absorbed in the soft X-rays during the entire campaign, and\nsignatures of new and strong outflows were present in the almost simultaneous\nUV HST/COS data. Here we carry out a comprehensive spectral analysis of all\navailable XMM-Newton observations of NGC 5548 (for a total of ~763 ks) in\ncombination with 3 simultaneous NuSTAR obs. We obtain a best-fit composed by i)\na weakly varying flat (Gamma~1.5-1.7) power-law component; ii) a constant, cold\nreflection (FeK + continuum) component; iii) a soft excess, possibly due to\nthermal Comptonization; and iv) a constant, ionized scattered emission-line\ndominated component. Our main findings are that, during the 2013 campaign, the\nfirst 3 of these components appear to be partially covered by a heavy and\nvariable obscurer located along the l.o.s. that is consistent with a multilayer\nof cold and mildly ionized gas. We characterize in detail the short timescale\n(~ks-to-days) spectral variability of this new obscurer, and find it is mostly\ndue to a combination of Nh and Cf variations, on top of intrinsic power-law\nvariations. In addition, our best-fit spectrum is left with several (but\nmarginal) absorption features at rest-frame energies ~6.7-6.9 keV and ~8 keV,\nas well as a weak broad emission line feature redwards of the 6.4 keV emission\nline. These could indicate a more complex underlying model, e.g. a P-Cygni-type\nprofile if allowing for a large velocity and wide-angle outflow. These findings\nare consistent with a picture where the obscurer represents the manifestation\nalong the l.o.s. of a multilayer of gas that is likely outflowing at high\nspeed, and simultaneously producing heavy obscuration and scattering in the\nX-rays and broad absorption features in the UV. \n\n"}

In this work, we gain insights into the\nrelative importance of different heating mechanisms using three-dimensional\nhydrodynamic simulations including cold gas accretion and momentum-driven jet\nfeedback, which are the most successful models to date in terms reproducing the\nproperties of cool cores. We find that there is net heating within two `jet\ncones' (within ~30 degrees from the axis of jet precession) where the ICM gains\nentropy by shock heating and mixing with the hot thermal gas within bubbles.\nOutside the jet cones, the ambient gas is heated by weak shocks, but not enough\nto overcome radiative cooling, therefore forming a `reduced' cooling flow.\nConsequently, the cluster core is in a process of `gentle circulation' over\nbillions of years. Within the jet cones, there is significant adiabatic cooling\nas the gas is uplifted by buoyantly rising bubbles; outside the cones, energy\nis supplied by inflow of already-heated gas from the jet cones as well as\nadiabatic compression as the gas moves toward the center. In other words, the\nfluid dynamics self-adjusts such that it compensates and transports the heat\nprovided by the AGN, and hence no fine-tuning of the heating profile of any\nprocess is necessary.

While a previous analysis shows a qualitative consistency\nbetween this suggestion and the Swift SGRB data, the distribution of observed\nbreak time $t_b$ is much narrower than the distribution of the collapse time of\nsupramassive NSs for the several NS equations-of-state (EoSs) investigated.

Leading candidates for their origin are\nblue supergiant collapsars, magnetars, and white dwarf tidal disruption events\n(WD-TDEs) caused by massive black holes (BHs). Recent observations of\nsupernova-like (SN-like) bumps associated with ulGRBs challenged both the\nWD-TDE and the blue supergiant models because of the detection of SNe and the\nabsence of hydrogen lines, respectively. We propose that WD-TDEs can\naccommodate the observed SN-like bumps if the fallback WD matter releases\nenergy into the unbound WD ejecta. The observed ejecta energy, luminosity, and\nvelocity are explained by the gravitational energy, Eddington luminosity, and\nescape velocity of the formed accretion disk, respectively.

This scenario typically requires a large \"boost factor\" to be\nconsistent with a thermal relic dark matter candidate produced via freeze-out.\nHowever, such an explanation is disfavored by constraints from CMB observations\non energy deposition during the epoch of recombination. We discuss a scenario\ncalled late-decaying two-component dark matter (LD2DM), where the entire DM\nconsists of two semi-degenerate species. Within this framework, the heavier\nspecies is produced as a thermal relic in the early universe and decays to the\nlighter species over cosmological timescales.

Previous studies of this type\ntreated the NS core as a normal fluid and thus did not account for its expected\nsuperfluidity. The source of buoyancy that supports the g modes is\nfundamentally different in the two cases: in a normal fluid core the buoyancy\nis due to gradients in the proton-to-neutron fraction whereas in a superfluid\ncore it is due to gradients in the muon-to-electron fraction. The latter yields\na stronger stratification and a superfluid NS therefore has a denser spectrum\nof g modes with frequencies above 10 Hz. As a result, many more g modes undergo\nresonant tidal excitation as the binary sweeps through the bandwidth of GW\ndetectors such as LIGO. We find that roughly 10 times more orbital energy is\ntransferred into g mode oscillations if the NS has a superfluid core rather\nthan a normal fluid core.

Addressing this problem is important because it\nimpacts directly on the maximum mass these objects can attain and hence on the\nthreshold to black-hole formation under realistic conditions. Using the results\nfrom a large number of numerical simulations in full general relativity of\nbinary neutron star mergers described with various equations of state and\nmasses, we study the rotational properties of the resulting hypermassive\nneutron stars. We find that the angular-velocity distribution shows only a\nmodest dependence on the equation of state, thus exhibiting the traits of\n\"quasi-universality\" found in other aspects of compact stars, both isolated and\nin binary systems.

The\nion-wake is shown to be a driven non-linear ion-acoustic wave in the form of a\ncylindrical ion-soliton. The near-void and radially-outwards propagating\nion-wake channel of a few plasma skin-depth radius, is explored for application\nto \"Crunch-in\" regime of positron acceleration. The coupling from the electron\nwakefield mode to the ion-mode dictates the long-term evolution of the plasma\nand the time for its relaxation back to an equilibrium, limiting the\nrepetition-rate of a plasma accelerator.

In weakly ionized gas as in PPDs, magnetic flux is largely\nfrozen in the electron fluid, except when resistivity is large. When the disk\nis largely laminar, we show that the relative drift between the electrons and\nions (the Hall-drift), and the ions and neutral fluids (ambipolar-drift) can\nplay a dominant role on the transport of magnetic flux. Using two-dimensional\nsimulations that incorporate the Hall effect and ambipolar diffusion (AD) with\nprescribed diffusivities, we show that when large-scale poloidal field is\naligned with disk rotation, the Hall effect rapidly drags magnetic flux inward\nat the midplane region, while it slowly pushes flux outward above/below the\nmidplane. This leads to a highly radially elongated field configuration as a\nglobal manifestation of the Hall-shear instability. This field configuration\nfurther promotes rapid outward flux transport by AD at the midplane, leading to\ninstability saturation. In quasi-steady state, magnetic flux is transported\noutward at approximately the same rate at all heights, and the rate is\ncomparable to the Hall-free case. For anti-aligned field polarity, the Hall\neffect consistently transports magnetic flux outward, leading to a largely\nvertical field configuration in the midplane region. The field lines in the\nupper layer first bend radially inward and then outward to launch a disk wind.\nOverall, the net rate of outward flux transport is about twice faster than the\naligned case. In addition, the rate of flux transport increases with increasing\ndisk magnetization. The absolute rate of transport is sensitive to disk\nmicrophysics which remains to be explored in future studies. \n\n"}

We consider the newborn BBHs formed\nthrough the evolution of isolated massive stellar binaries. For a close massive\nbinary, consisting of a primary black hole (BH) and a secondary Wolf-Rayet (WR)\nstar that are orbiting around each other, the spin period of the WR star can be\ntidally synchronized to its orbital period. Then, the angular momentum of the\nouter material of the WR star is large enough to form an accretion disk around\na newborn, secondary BH, following its core-collapse. This disk may produce an\nenergetic outflow with a kinetic energy of $\\sim10^{50}-10^{52}$ erg and an\noutflow velocity of $\\sim10^{10}\\rm~cm~s^{-1}$, resulting in an optical\ntransient with an absolute magnitude from $\\sim -14$ to $\\sim-17$ with a\nduration of around a day.

It is then important to study variations of evolutionary\nchannels for merging BHs, which might instead form accreting BHs and become\nULXs. It was recently shown that massive binaries with mass ratios close to\nunity and tight orbits can undergo efficient rotational mixing and evolve\nchemically homogeneously, resulting in a compact BH binary. We study similar\nsystems by computing ~120000 detailed binary models with the MESA code covering\na wide range of initial parameters. For initial mass ratios M2/M1~0.1-0.4,\nprimaries >40Msun can evolve chemically homogeneously, remaining compact and\nforming a BH without undergoing Roche-lobe overflow. The secondary then expands\nand transfers mass to the BH, initiating a ULX phase. We predict that ~1 out of\n10^4 massive stars evolves this way, and that in the local universe 0.13 ULXs\nper Msun yr^-1 of star-formation rate are observable, with a strong preference\nfor low-metallicities. At metallicities log Z>-3, BH masses in ULXs are limited\nto 60Msun due to the occurrence of pair-instability supernovae which leave no\nremnant, resulting in an X-ray luminosity cut-off. At lower metallicities, very\nmassive stars can avoid exploding as pair-instability supernovae and instead\nform BHs with masses above 130Msun, producing a gap in the ULX luminosity\ndistribution.

Most of the previous studies have focused on Sweet-Parker current\nsheets, which, however, are unattainable in typical astrophysical systems.\nHere, we derive a general set of scaling laws for the plasmoid instability in\nresistive and visco-resistive current sheets that evolve over time. Our method\nrelies on a principle of least time that enables us to determine the properties\nof the reconnecting current sheet (aspect ratio and elapsed time) and the\nplasmoid instability (growth rate, wavenumber, inner layer width) at the end of\nthe linear phase. After this phase the reconnecting current sheet is disrupted\nand fast reconnection can occur.

Since 1987 the scale and sensitivity of the detectors capable of\nidentifying neutrinos from a Galactic supernova have grown considerably so that\ncurrent generation detectors are capable of detecting of order ten thousand\nneutrinos for a supernova at the Galactic Center. Next generation detectors\nwill increase that yield by another order of magnitude. Simultaneous with the\ngrowth of neutrino detection capability, our understanding of how massive stars\nexplode and how the neutrino interacts with hot and dense matter has also\nincreased by a tremendous degree.

Since the mass fallback rate shows a different variability depending on\nthese orbital types, we can classify tidal disruption events (TDEs) into three\nmain categories: eccentric, parabolic, and hyperbolic TDEs.

By means of high-resolution two-dimensional hydrodynamical\nsimulations, we study the three feedback effects (the stellar wind heating, SNe\nfeedback, and AGN feedback) in suppressing star formation activities on the\nevolution of early-type galaxies with different stellar masses. AGN feedback\nmodels are updated based on \\citet{Yuan2018}. The gas sources comes exclusively\nfrom the mass losses of dying low-mass stars for most of our models. We find\nthat SNe feedback can keep star formation at a significantly low level for low\nmass elliptical galaxies for a cosmological evolution time. For the high mass\ngalaxies, AGN feedback can efficiently offset the radiative cooling and thus\nregulate the star formation activities. Such a suppression of star formation is\nextremely efficient in the inner region of the galaxies. AGB heating cannot\naccount for this suppression for low and high mass galaxies.

Spectral signatures of hybrid disk configurations Abstract: It has been suggested that the cycles of activity of X-ray Binaries (XrB) are\ntriggered by a switch in the dominant disk torque responsible for accretion\n(paper I). As the disk accretion rate increases, the disk innermost regions\nwould change from a jet-emitting disk (JED) to a standard accretion disk (SAD).\nWhile JEDs have been proven to successfully reproduce hard states (paper II),\nthe existence of an outer cold SAD introduces an extra non local cooling term.\nWe investigate the thermal structure and associated spectra of such a hybrid\ndisk configuration. We use the 2T plasma code elaborated in paper II, allowing\nto compute outside-in the disk local thermal equilibrium with self-consistent\nadvection and optically thin-to-thick transitions, in both radiation and gas\nsupported regimes. The non-local inverse Compton cooling introduced by the\nexternal soft photons is computed by the BELM code. This additional term has a\nprofound influence on JED solutions, allowing a smooth temperature transition\nfrom the outer SAD to the inner JED. We explore the full parameter space in\ndisk accretion rate and transition radius, and show that the whole domain in\nX-ray fluxes and hardness ratios covered by standard XrB cycles is well\nreproduced by such hybrid configurations. Precisely, a reasonable combination\nof these parameters allows to reproduce the 3-200 keV spectra of five canonical\nXrB states. Along with X-ray signatures, JED-SAD configurations also naturally\naccount for the radio emission whenever it is observed. By varying only the\ntransition radius and the accretion rate, hybrid disk configurations combining\nan inner JED and an outer SAD are able to reproduce simultaneously the X-ray\nspectral states and radio emission of X-ray binaries during their outburst.\nAdjusting these two parameters, it is then possible to reproduce a full cycle.\nThis will be shown in a forthcoming paper (paper IV). \n\n"}

Abstract: Supermassive black hole binaries may be detectable by an upcoming suite of\ngravitational wave experiments. Their binary nature can also be revealed by\nradio jets via a short-period precession driven by the orbital motion as well\nas the geodetic precession at typically longer periods. We have investigated\nKarl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and MERLIN radio maps of powerful jet\nsources for morphological evidence of geodetic precession. For perhaps the best\nstudied source, Cygnus A, we find strong evidence for geodetic precession.\nProjection effects can enhance precession features, for which we find\nindications in strongly projected sources. For a complete sample of 33 3CR\nradio sources we find strong evidence for jet precession in 24 cases (73 per\ncent). The morphology of the radio maps suggests that the precession periods\nare of the order of 10^6 - 10^7 yr. We consider different explanations for the\nmorphological features and conclude that geodetic precession is the best\nexplanation. The frequently observed gradual jet angle changes in samples of\npowerful blazars can be explained by orbital motion. Both observations can be\nexplained simultaneously by postulating that a high fraction of powerful radio\nsources have sub-parsec supermassive black hole binaries. We consider\ncomplementary evidence and discuss if any jetted supermassive black hole with\nsome indication of precession could be detected as individual gravitational\nwave source in the near future.

This process can repeat several times and lead to\nsignificant mass growth. In this paper, we calculate the mass of the largest BH\nthat can be formed through repeated mergers of stellar seed BHs and determine\nhow its value depends on the physical properties of the host cluster. We adopt\nan analytical model in which the energy generated by the black hole binaries in\nthe cluster core is assumed to be regulated by the process of two-body\nrelaxation in the bulk of the system. This principle is used to compute the\nhardening rate of the binaries and to relate this to the time-dependent global\nproperties of the parent cluster. We demonstrate that in clusters with initial\nescape velocity $\\gtrsim 300\\rm km\\ s^{-1}$ in the core and density $\\gtrsim\n10^5\\ M_\\odot\\rm pc^{-3}$, repeated mergers lead to the formation of BHs in the\nmass range $100-10^5 \\,M_\\odot$, populating any upper mass gap created by\npair-instability supernovae.

We show that the non-linear `super-quadratic' relation\n$M_{\\rm bh}\\propto L_B^2$-$L_B^{2.5}$ from Graham & Scott yields black hole\nmasses, $M_{\\rm bh}$, that agree with the $M_{\\rm bh}$-$\\sigma$ relation down\nto at least $M_{\\rm bh}=10^4\\,M_{\\odot}$. We predict that 30 of the 100\ngalaxies have $M_{\\rm bh}\\le10^5\\,M_{\\odot}$, with IC3602 having $M_{\\rm\nbh}=10^4\\,M_{\\odot}$ and IC3633 having $M_{\\rm\nbh}=$(6-8)$\\times10^3\\,M_{\\odot}$. We additionally revise the black hole\nEddington ratios and their scaling with black hole mass, and report a\npoint-like Chandra source at the nucleus of five additional galaxies (NGC4382,\nNGC4387, NGC4417, NGC4467, and NGC4472). Moreover, three of the galaxies\npredicted here to host an IMBH have a point-like Chandra source near their\nnucleus: IC3442 ($M_{\\rm bh}=2\\times10^5\\,M_{\\odot}$); IC3492 ($M_{\\rm\nbh}=5\\times10^4\\,M_{\\odot}$); and IC3292 ($M_{\\rm bh}=6\\times10^4\\,M_{\\odot}$).\nFurthermore, IC3442 and IC3292 host a nuclear star cluster that is expected to\nhouse an IMBH. Finally, we present the ($B-K$)-$\\mathfrak{M}_K$\ncolour-magnitude diagram and discuss the implications for the $M_{\\rm\nbh}$-$L_K$ and $M_{\\rm bh}$-$M_{\\rm *,galaxy}$ relations, revealing why\nstripped galaxies, especially rare compact elliptical galaxies, should be\nexcluded from $M_{\\rm bh}$-$L$ and $M_{\\rm bh}$-$M_{\\rm *,galaxy}$ scaling\nrelations. \n\n"}

Older clusters tend to be more concentrated than younger clusters.\nTheir structure, represented by the characteristic radius $r_s$ and mass $M_s$\nof the Navarro--Frenk--White (NFW) density profile, is related to their\nformation time. In~this study, we showed that $r_s$, $M_s$, and the X-ray\ntemperature of the intracluster medium (ICM), $T_X$, form a thin plane in the\nspace of $(\\log r_s, \\log M_s, \\log T_X)$. This tight correlation indicates\nthat the ICM temperature is also determined by the formation time of individual\nclusters. Numerical simulations showed that clusters move along the fundamental\nplane as they evolve. The plane and the cluster evolution within the plane\ncould be explained by a similarity solution of structure formation of the\nuniverse. The angle of the plane shows that clusters have not achieved \"virial\nequilibrium\" in the sense that mass/size growth and pressure at the boundaries\ncannot be ignored. The distribution of clusters on the plane was related to the\nintrinsic scatter in the halo concentration--mass relation, which originated\nfrom the variety of cluster ages. The well-known mass--temperature relation of\nclusters ($M_\\Delta\\propto T_X^{3/2}$) can be explained by the fundamental\nplane and the mass dependence of the halo concentration without the assumption\nof virial equilibrium.

The logarithmic density\nslopes gamma = d(log rho)/d(log r) of the LCDM halos are found to vary as\npower-laws in radius, reaching values of gamma ~ -1 at the innermost resolved\nradii (~0.01 r_virial). This behavior is significantly different from that of\nbroken power-law models like the NFW profile, but similar to that of models\nlike de Vaucouleurs'. Accordingly, we compare the N-body density profiles with\nvarious parametric models to find which provide the best fit.
