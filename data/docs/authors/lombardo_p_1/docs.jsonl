By substituting Ba2+ for K+ ions we have\nintroduced holes in the (FeAs)- layers, which suppress the SDW anomaly and\ninduce superconductivity. This scenario is very similar to the recently\ndiscovered arsenide-oxide superconductors. The Tc of 38 K in (Ba1-xKx)Fe2As2 is\nthe highest observed critical temperature in hole doped iron arsenide\nsuperconductors so far. Therefore, we were able to expand this class of\nsuperconductors by oxygen-free compounds with the ThCr2Si2-type structure.

As with the $Z_2$ form of L. de'Medici et al. (Phys. Rev. B 72, 205124\n(2005)), this approach represents a physical electron operator as the product\nof a slave spin and an auxiliary fermion operator. For non-degenerate\nmulti-orbital models, our U(1) approach is advantageous in that it captures the\nnon-interacting limit at the mean-field level. For systems with either a single\norbital or degenerate multiple orbitals, the U(1) and $Z_2$ slave-spin\napproachs yield the same results in the slave-spin-condensed phase. In general,\nthe U(1) slave-spin approach contains a U(1) gauge redundancy, and properly\ndescribes a Mott insulating phase. We apply the U(1) slave-spin approach to\nstudy the metal-to-insulator transition in a five-orbital model for parent iron\npnictides. We demonstrate a Mott transition as a function of the interactions\nin this model. The nature of the Mott insulating state is influenced by the\ninterplay between the Hund's rule coupling and crystal field splittings. In the\nmetallic phase, when the Hund's rule coupling is beyond a threshold, there is a\ncrossover from a weakly correlated metal to a strongly correlated one, through\nwhich the quasiparticle speactral weight rapidly drops. The existence of such a\nstrongly correlated metallic phase supports the incipient Mott picture of the\nparent iron pnictides. In the parameter regime for this phase and in the\nvicinity of the Mott transition, we find that an orbital selective Mott state\nhas nearly as competitive a ground state energy. \n\n"}

Here, we make\nthe connection between Abelian as well as non-Abelian FQH states and FCIs more\nprecise. Using a gauge-fixed version of Qi's Wannier basis representation of a\nChern band, we demonstrate that the interpolation between several FCI states,\nobtained by short-range lattice interactions in a spin-orbit-coupled kagome\nlattice model, and the corresponding continuum FQH states is smooth: the gap\nremains approximately constant and extrapolates to a finite value in the\nthermodynamic limit, while the low-lying part of the orbital entanglement\nspectrum remains qualitatively unaltered. The orbital entanglement spectra also\nprovide a first glimpse of the edge physics of FCIs via the bulk-boundary\ncorrespondence.

The system displays\neither a self-screened Kondo effect, or a Kondo effect with SO(3) or SO(4)\ndynamical symmetries.

In a Landau Fermi\nLiquid, the single-impurity Kondo effect is the screening of an impurity spin\nat low temperature $T$. The two-impurity Kondo model then describes the\ncompetition between the Kondo interaction and the Heisenberg interaction\nbetween two impurity spins, also called the RKKY interaction. For spin-$1/2$\nimpurities, that competition leads to a quantum phase transition from a\nKondo-screened phase to a phase in which the two impurity spins screen one\nanother. Our holographic model is based on a $(1+1)$-dimensional CFT\ndescription of the two-impurity Kondo model, reliable for two impurities with\nnegligible separation in space. We consider only impurity spins in a totally\nanti-symmetric representation of an $SU(N)$ spin symmetry. We employ a\nlarge-$N$ limit, in which both Kondo and RKKY couplings are double-trace, and\nboth Kondo and inter-impurity screening appear as condensation of single-trace\noperators at the impurities' location. We perform the holographic\nrenormalization of our model, which allows us to identify the Kondo and RKKY\ncouplings as boundary conditions on fields in AdS. We numerically compute the\nphase diagram of our model in the plane of RKKY coupling versus $T$, finding\nevidence for a quantum phase transition from a trivial phase, with neither\nKondo nor inter-impurity screening, to a non-trivial phase, with both Kondo and\nanti-ferromagnetic inter-impurity screening. More generally we show, just using\n$SU(N)$ representation theory, that ferromagnetic correlations must be absent\nat leading order in the large-$N$ limit.

We demonstrate that the quantity which is\nordering is sublattice parity, referring to the geometric property of a\nbipartite lattice that it can be subdivided in two sublattices in two different\nways. Re-interpreting standard results of one dimensional physics, we\ndemonstrate that the same order is responsible for the phenomenon of\nspin-charge separation in strongly interacting one dimensional electron\nsystems.

The\ncuprates seems to exhibit statistics, dimensionality and phase transitions in\nnovel ways. The nature of excitations [i.e. quasiparticle or collective] must\nbe understood. The Hubbard model captures some of the behaviour of the phase\ntransitions in these materials. On the other hand the phases such as stripes in\nthese materials bear relationship to quantum group or string-like solutions.\nOne thus expects that the relevant solutions of Hubbard model may thus be\nwritten in terms of stringy solutions. In short this approach may lead to the\nnon-perturbative formualtion of Hubbard and other condensed matter\nHamiltonians. The question arises that how a 1-d based symmetry such as quantum\ngroups can be relevant in describing a 3-d [spatial dimensions] system such as\ncuprates. The answer lies in the key observation that strings which are 1-d\nobjects can be used to describe physics in $d$ dimensions. For example gravity\n[which is a 3-d [spatial] plus time] phenomenon can be understood in terms of\n1-d strings. Thus we expect that 1-d quantum group object induces physics in\n2-d and 3-d which may be relevant to the cuprates. We present support for our\ncontention using [numerical] variational Monte-Carlo [MC] applied to 2d d-p\nmodel. We also briefly discuss others ways to formulate a string picture for\ncuprates, namely by exploiting connection between gauge theories and strings\nand t'Hooft picture of quark confinement. \n\n"}

The well\nmeasured experimental inhomogeneous charge density in a given compound is\nassumed to produce a spatial distribution of local $\\rho(r)$.

In the metallic region, the\ninhomogeneous charge density yields also spatial distributions of\nsuperconducting critical temperatures $T_c(r)$ and zero temperature gap\n$\\Delta_0(r)$. For a given sample, the measured onset of vanishing gap\ntemperature is identified as the pseudogap temperature, that is, $T^*$, which\nis the maximum of all $T_c(r)$.

Flows\nfor a general class of correlation functions are derived, and it is shown how\nsymmetry relations of the underlying theory are lifted to the regularised\ntheory. A simple equation for the flow of these relations is provided. The\nsetting includes general flows in the presence of composite operators and their\nrelation to standard flows, an important example being NPI quantities. We\ndiscuss optimisation and derive a functional optimisation criterion.\nApplications deal with the interrelation between functional flows and the\nquantum equations of motion, general Dyson-Schwinger equations. We discuss the\ncombined use of these functional equations as well as outlining the\nconstruction of practical renormalisation schemes, also valid in the presence\nof composite operators. Furthermore, the formalism is used to derive various\nrepresentations of modified symmetry relations in gauge theories, as well as to\ndiscuss gauge-invariant flows. We close with the construction and analysis of\ntruncation schemes in view of practical optimisation. \n\n"}

We show that the time-averaged dynamics in\nsuch systems bear a striking resemblance to conventional many-body physics. For\nthe specific example of the Minority Game, this analogy enables us to obtain\nanalytic expressions which are in excellent agreement with numerical\nsimulations. \n\n"}

It\nis used here in order to study the behaviour of low energy states of strongly\ninteracting quantum many-body systems at first order transitions and avoided\ncrossings. The method is tested on different frustrated quantum spin ladders\nwith two legs. The role and importance of symmetries are investigated by using\ndifferent bases of states. \n\n"}
