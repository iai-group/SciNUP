Measurements and comparison with relativistic hydrodynamic models\nindicate that the matter thermalizes in an unexpectedly short time, has an\nenergy density at least 15 times larger than needed for color deconfinement,\nhas a temperature about twice the critical temperature predicted by lattice\nQCD, and appears to exhibit collective motion with ideal hydrodynamic\nproperties - a \"perfect liquid\" that appears to flow with a near-zero viscosity\nto entropy ratio - lower than any previously observed fluid and perhaps close\nto a universal lower bound. However, a fundamental understanding of the medium\nseen in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC does not yet exist. The most important\nscientific challenge for the field in the next decade is the quantitative\nexploration of the new state of nuclear matter.

The\norigin of the problems is yet to be identified. A large number of unstable\nnuclei with only theoretically predicted reaction rates are included in the\nreaction network and thus the nuclear input may involve uncertainties.\nDeficiencies in charged-particle optical potentials at gamma-process\ntemperatures have been found for nuclei at stability.

The meson-baryon nature of\nLambda(1405) leads to various hadronic molecule states in few-body systems with\nstrangeness which are hadron composite systems driven by the hadronic\ninteractions. We summarize the recent progress in the investigation of the\nLambda(1405) structure and future perspective of the physics of the\nLambda(1405) resonance. \n\n"}

In\ncontrasting this behaviour with that produced by a momentum-dependent\ninteraction, one achieves comparisons which highlight that elastic scattering\nand resonance electroproduction experiments probe the infrared evolution of\nQCD's running masses; e.g., the existence, and location if so, of a zero in the\nratio of nucleon Sachs form factors are strongly influenced by the running of\nthe dressed-quark mass. In our description of baryons, diquark correlations are\nimportant. These correlations are instrumental in producing a zero in the Dirac\nform factor of the proton's d-quark; and in determining d_v/u_v(x=1), as we\nshow via a formula that expresses d_v/u_v(x=1) in terms of the nucleon's\ndiquark content.

This anisotropy is characterized via a Fourier expansion of the\ndistribution of charged particles in azimuthal angle (phi), with the\ncoefficients v_n denoting the magnitude of the anisotropy. Significant v_2-v_6\nvalues are obtained as a function of transverse momentum (0.5<pT<20 GeV),\npseudorapidity (|eta|<2.5) and centrality using an event plane method. The v_n\nvalues for n>=3 are found to vary weakly with both eta and centrality, and\ntheir pT dependencies are found to follow an approximate scaling relation,\nv_n^{1/n}(pT) \\propto v_2^{1/2}(pT). A Fourier analysis of the charged particle\npair distribution in relative azimuthal angle (Dphi=phi_a-phi_b) is performed\nto extract the coefficients v_{n,n}=<cos (n Dphi)>. For pairs of charged\nparticles with a large pseudorapidity gap (|Deta=eta_a-eta_b|>2) and one\nparticle with pT<3 GeV, the v_{2,2}-v_{6,6} values are found to factorize as\nv_{n,n}(pT^a,pT^b) ~ v_n(pT^a)v_n(pT^b) in central and mid-central events. Such\nfactorization suggests that these values of v_{2,2}-v_{6,6} are primarily due\nto the response of the created matter to the fluctuations in the geometry of\nthe initial state. A detailed study shows that the v_{1,1}(pT^a,pT^b) data are\nconsistent with the combined contributions from a rapidity-even v_1 and global\nmomentum conservation. A two-component fit is used to extract the v_1\ncontribution.

Modification of\nheavy-flavor production in heavy-ion collisions relative to binary-collision\nscaling from p+p results, quantified with the nuclear-modification factor\n(R_AA), provides information on both cold- and hot-nuclear-matter effects.\n  Purpose: Determine transverse-momentum, pt, spectra and the corresponding\nR_AA for muons from heavy-flavor mesons decay in p+p and Cu+Cu collisions at\nsqrt(s_NN)=200 GeV and y=1.65.\n  Method: Results are obtained using the semi-leptonic decay of heavy-flavor\nmesons into negative muons.

In this work a compact formula is found that\nrepresents the inclusive distributions of minijets of any parton type at the\nsurface of the medium for any collision centrality. They take into account the\ncontributions from all initiating partons created at any point in the medium.\nBy comparing with the case of no energy loss, a ratio has been determined that\nis analogous to the nuclear modification factor for minijets. Phenomenological\nreality of such distributions is examined by calculating the hadronization of\nthe minijets in the recombination model. Good fits of the data on pion, kaon\nand proton production throughout the intermediate \\ppt\\ region have been\nobtained by adjusting the parameters controlling the magnitude of the thermal\npartons and the degradation rates of the semihard partons.

An important property made manifest\nin this study is that quarks and gluons must not lose energy in the same way\nbecause the partons form mesons and baryons differently by recombination and\nthe momenta of quarks and gluons must be degraded at different rates in order\nto reproduce the experimental pion and proton spectra.

The data were collected in 2010 by\nthe PHENIX experiment that included the new hadron-blind detector. The\ninvariant yield of electrons from heavy-flavor decays is measured as a function\nof transverse momentum in the range $1<p_T^e<5$ GeV/$c$. The invariant yield\nper binary collision is slightly enhanced above the $p$$+$$p$ reference in\nAu$+$Au 0%--20%, 20%--40% and 40%--60% centralities at a comparable level. This\nmay be a result of the interplay between initial-state Cronin effects,\nfinal-state flow, and energy loss for heavy-quark production at this low beam\nenergy. The $v_2$ of electrons from heavy-flavor decays is nonzero when\naveraged between $1.3<p_T^e<2.5$ GeV/$c$ from $0<{\\rm centrality}<40$%\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=62.4$ GeV.

They have also recently become the\nbaseline for studying the in-medium modification of parton showers in\nultra-relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions. The jet shape is a function of\ntwo angular parameters $R$ and $r$, which can be at hierarchical scales.

In addition, these modes of excitation appear to be\nsensitive to the uncertain density dependence of the symmetry energy. We study\nthe emergence, evolution, and nature of both the soft and giant isoscalar\nmonopole modes as a function of neutron excess in three unstable Nickel\nisotopes: 56Ni, 68Ni, and 78Ni. The distribution of isoscalar monopole strength\nis computed in a relativistic random-phase approximation using several\naccurately calibrated effective interactions. In particular, a non-spectral\nGreen's function approach is adopted that allows for an exact treatment of the\ncontinuum without any reliance on discretization. The discretization of the\ncontinuum is neither required nor admitted. In the case of 56Ni, the lack of\nlow-energy strength results in a direct correlation between the centroid energy\nof the giant monopole resonance and the incompressibility coefficient of\nsymmetric nuclear matter.

These degeneracies cannot be broken by the CMB constraint on the\neffective number of neutrinos, N_eff. However, since big bang nucleosynthesis\n(BBN) is also affected by a light WIMP and equivalent neutrinos, complementary\nBBN and CMB constraints can break some of the degeneracy. In a previous paper\nBBN and CMB were combined to explore allowed ranges for m_chi, Delta N_nu, and\nN_eff for light WIMPs that annihilate electromagnetically (EM) to photons\nand/or electrons/positrons. In this paper BBN predictions with a light WIMP\nthat only couples to neutrinos are calculated. Recent observed abundances of\n^2H and ^4He are used to limit m_chi, Delta N_nu, N_eff, and the present-day\nbaryon density. Allowing for a neutrino coupled light WIMP and nonzero Delta\nN_nu, combined BBN and CMB data give lower limits to m_chi, with a best fit\nm_chi > 35 MeV, equivalent to no light WIMP at all. All masses below 4--9 MeV\n(depending on spin) are excluded. Without any light WIMP, BBN alone prefers\nDelta N_nu = 0.50 +- 0.23, favoring neither Delta N_nu = 0, nor a fully\nthermalized sterile neutrino (Delta N_nu = 1).

The perturbation\ntheory in $g^2_L$, where $g_L$ is the vertex of the $L$-phonon creation, is\nused for PC calculations.\n  PC corrections to single-particle energies are found self-consistently with\nan approximate account for the tadpole diagram.

This work made it clear that consistency of\nindependent analyses of exclusive channels with different couplings and\nnon-resonant backgrounds but the same $N^*$ electro-excitation amplitudes, is\nessential to have confidence in the extracted results.

However, the\nprocedure is complicated by combinatorial ambiguities: e.g., the visible final\nstate particles may be indistinguishable (as in the case of QCD jets), or one\nmay not know the exact order in which they are emitted along the decay chain.\nIn order to avoid such combinatorial ambiguities, we propose to treat the final\nstate particles fully democratically and consider the sorted set of the\ninvariant masses of all possible partitions of the visible particles in the\ndecay chain. In particular, for a decay to N visible particles, one considers\nthe sorted sets of all possible n-body invariant mass combinations (2 <= n <=\nN) and determines the kinematic endpoint m_(n,r)^max of the distribution of the\nr-th largest n-body invariant mass m_(n,r) for each possible value of n and r.\nFor the classic example of a squark decay in supersymmetry, we provide\nanalytical formulas for the interpretation of these endpoints in terms of the\nunderlying physical masses.

To this end, we introduce a stochastic model of the residual magnetic\nfield within the propagation region which draws on features of magnetic\nprofiles measured during the last free neutron oscillation experiment\n[conducted at the Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL) in the 1990's]. We average over\nboth fluctuations in the magnetic field sampled by neutrons, and representative\nspectra of neutron speeds. We find that deviations from the quasi-free result\nfor the antineutron probability do not depend quadratically on $l$ (as a naive\nperturbative estimate would suggest) but increase only linearly with $l$. As\nregards the large spikes in the magnetic field which can be expected at, for\nexample, joints in the magnetic shielding of the propagation region (despite\ncompensating currents and magnetic idealization of the shield), we demonstrate\nthat their effect scales as $l/D^{3/2}$, where $D$ is the diameter of the\ncylindrical magnetic shielding. Our arguments suggest that, provided the\ndimensions of the propagation region are such that the ratio $l/D^{3/2}$ does\nnot exceed the value pertinent to the ILL experiment, and these spikes occur\nclose to either end of the propagation region, they can be neglected. We also\nestablish that any large magnetic field encountered after the propagation\nregion is exited will not diminish the probability for antineutron detection.\nFor the range of values of $l$ of most interest to the ESS experiment, it\nshould suffice to improve on the level of magnetic suppression achieved at the\nILL by a factor of two. \n\n"}

This can lead to observable charge separation along the\ndirection of the strong magnetic field produced by spectator protons in\nrelativistic heavy-ion collisions, a phenomenon called the chiral magnetic\neffect (CME). A major background source for CME measurements using the\ncharge-dependent azimuthal correlator ($\\Delta\\gamma$) is the intrinsic\nparticle correlations (such as resonance decays) coupled with the azimuthal\nelliptical anisotropy ($v_{2}$). In heavy-ion collisions, the magnetic field\ndirection and event plane angle are correlated, thus the CME and the\n$v_{2}$-induced background are entangled. In this report, we present two\nstudies from STAR to shed further lights on the background issue. (1) The\n$\\Delta\\gamma$ should be all background in small system p+Au and d+Au\ncollisions, because the event plane angles are dominated by geometry\nfluctuations uncorrelated to the magnetic field direction.

Assuming a length $<{L}>\\approx 7$ fm for central Au$+$Au collisions the\npresent result gives $\\hat{q}\\approx 0.30\\pm 0.09$ GeV$^2$/fm, in fair\nagreement with the JET collaboration result from single hadron suppression of\n$\\hat{q}\\approx 1.2\\pm 0.3$ GeV$^2$/fm at an initial time $\\tau_0=0.6$ fm/c in\nAu$+$Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV. There are several interesting\ndetails to be discussed: for a given $p_{Tt}$ the $<{\\hat{q}L}>$ seems to\ndecrease then vanish with increasing $p_{Ta}$; the di-jet spends a much longer\ntime in the medium ($\\approx 7$ fm/c) then $\\tau_0=0.6$ fm/c which likely\naffects the value of $\\hat{q}$ that would be observed. \n\n"}

But as\nexperimental data never reach that limit, numerous methods for making the\nextraction have been proposed, though often the functions are determined after\nseeing the data which can lead to confirmation bias. To find functional forms\nthat will allow for a robust extraction of the input radius for a wide variety\nof functional forms in order to have confidence in the extraction from upcoming\nlow $Q^2$ experimental data such as the Jefferson Lab PRad experiment, we\ncreate a general framework for inputting form-factor functions as well as\nvarious fitting functions. The input form factors are used to generate\npseudo-data with fluctuations intended to mimic the binning and random\nuncertainty of a given set of real data. All combinations of input functions\nand fit functions can then be tested repeatedly against regenerated\npseudo-data. Since the input radius is known, this allows us to find fit\nfunctions that are robust for radius extractions in an objective fashion. For\nthe range and uncertainty of the PRad data, we find that a two-parameter\nrational function, a two-parameter continued fraction and the second order\npolynomial expansion of $z$ can extract the input radius regardless of the\ninput charge form factor function that is used.

It was previously\nobserved that in $\\rm{p}\\rm{p}$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV the average pair\ntransverse momentum $k_{\\rm T}$ range of such analyses is limited due to large\nbackground correlations which were attributed to mini-jet phenomena. To\ninvestigate this further, an event-shape dependent analysis of Bose-Einstein\ncorrelations for pion pairs is performed in this work. By categorizing the\nevents by their transverse sphericity $S_{\\rm T}$ into spherical\n$(S_\\textrm{T}>0.7)$ and jet-like $(S_\\textrm{T}<0.3)$ events a method was\ndeveloped that allows for the determination of source radii for much larger\nvalues of $k_{\\rm T}$ for the first time. Spherical events demonstrate little\nor no background correlations while jet-like events are dominated by them. This\nobservation agrees with the hypothesis of a mini-jet origin of the\nnon-femtoscopic background correlations and gives new insight into the physics\ninterpretation of the $k_{\\rm T}$ dependence of the radii. The emission source\nsize in spherical events shows a substantially diminished $k_{\\rm T}$\ndependence, while jet-like events show indications of a negative trend with\nrespect to $k_{\\rm T}$ in the highest multiplicity events.

The\nrapidity-odd directed flow at mid-rapidity in heavy-ion collisions originates\nfrom a tilt in the reaction plane of the thermalized medium caused by the\nasymmetry between the number of participants from projectile and target nuclei\nas a function of rapidity. Recently, it has been predicted that the slope of\nthe directed flow at mid-rapidity for $D^0$ mesons, arising from the transport\nof charm quarks in the tilted medium, can be several times larger than that of\nlight flavor hadrons. The magnitude of the slope is expected to be sensitive to\nthe magnitude of the tilt and the charm quark drag coefficient in the medium.\nIt has also been predicted that the transient electromagnetic field generated\nat early time can induce a much larger directed flow for heavy quarks than for\nlight quarks.

The general concordance\nbetween the predicted and observed light element abundances provides a direct\nprobe of the universal baryon density. Recent CMB anisotropy measurements,\nparticularly the observations performed by the WMAP satellite, examine this\nconcordance by independently measuring the cosmic baryon density. Key to this\ntest of concordance is a quantitative understanding of the uncertainties in the\nBBN light element abundance predictions. These uncertainties are dominated by\nsystematic errors in nuclear cross sections. We critically analyze the cross\nsection data, producing representations that describe this data and its\nuncertainties, taking into account the correlations among data, and explicitly\ntreating the systematic errors between data sets. Using these updated nuclear\ninputs, we compute the new BBN abundance predictions, and quantitatively\nexamine their concordance with observations.

Isotopically resolved yield distributions of projectile fragments in\nthe range Z=10-36 from these reaction pairs were measured with the MARS recoil\nseparator in the angular range 2.7-5.3 degrees. The velocities of the residues,\nmonotonically decreasing with Z down to Z~26-28, are employed to characterize\nthe excitation energy. The yield ratios R21(N,Z) for each pair of systems are\nfound to exhibit isotopic scaling (isoscaling), namely, an exponential\ndependence on the fragment atomic number Z and neutron number N. The isoscaling\nis found to occur in the residue Z range corresponding to the maximum observed\nexcitation energies. The corresponding isoscaling parameters are alpha=0.43 and\nbeta=-0.50 for the Kr+Sn system and alpha=0.27 and beta=-0.34 for the Kr+Ni\nsystem.

These calculations should be\ncorrected for diffraction. Moreover, they miss the Gribov's inelastic shadowing\nwhich makes nuclei more transparent (color transparency). The magnitude of this\neffect rises with energy and it may dramatically affect the normalization of\nthe RHIC data. We evaluate these corrections employing the light-cone dipole\nformalism and found a rather modest corrections for the current normalization\nof the d-Au data. The results of experiments insensitive to diffraction\n(PHENIX, PHOBOS) should be renormalized by about 20% down, while those which\ninclude diffraction (STAR), by only 10%. Such a correction completely\neliminates the Cronin enhancement in the PHENIX data for pions. The largest\ntheoretical uncertainty comes from the part of the inelastic shadowing which is\nrelated to diffractive gluon radiation, or gluon shadowing. Our estimate is\nadjusted to data for the triple-Pomeron coupling, however, other models do not\nhave such a restrictions and predict much stronger gluon shadowing. Therefore,\nthe current data for high-pT hadron production in d-Au collisions at RHIC\ncannot exclude in a model independent way the possibility if initial state\nsuppression proposed by Kharzeev-Levin-McLerran. Probably the only way to\nsettle this uncertainty is a direct measurement of the inelastic d-Au cross\nsections at RHIC. Also d-Au collisions with a tagged spectator nucleon may\nserve as a sensitive probe for nuclear transparency and inelastic shadowing. We\nfound an illuminating quantum-mechanical effect: the nucleus acts like a lens\nfocusing spectators into a very narrow cone. \n\n"}
