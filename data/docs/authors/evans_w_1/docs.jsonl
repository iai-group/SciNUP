We also present estimates of the fraction of cores in the\n\"prestellar\", \"stellar'', and \"failed\" (those cores that redisperse back into\nthe environment) stages as a function of n_thr. The number ratios are measured\nindirectly in the simulations due to their resolution limitations. Our approach\ncontains one free parameter, the lifetime of a protostellar object t_yso (Class\n0 + Class I stages), which is outside the realm of the simulations. Assuming a\nvalue t_yso = 0.46 Myr, we obtain number ratios of starless to stellar cores\nranging from 4-5 at n_thr = 1.5 x 10^4 cm^-3 to 1 at n_thr = 1.2 x 10^5 cm^-3,\nagain in good agreement with observational determinations.

Because AGN luminosity is likely to depend on Mbh, selection\neffects are different for high-redshift and local samples, potentially\nproducing a false signal of evolution. This bias arises because cosmic scatter\nin the Mbh-sigma and Mbh-L relations means that the mean log(L) or log(sigma)\namong galaxies that host a black hole of given Mbh, may be substantially\ndifferent than the log(L) or log(sigma) obtained from inverting the Mbh-L or\nMbh-sigma relations for the same nominal Mbh. The bias is particularly strong\nat high Mbh, where the luminosity and dispersion functions of galaxies are\nfalling rapidly. The most massive black holes occur more often as rare outliers\nin galaxies of modest mass than in the even rarer high-mass galaxies, which\nwould otherwise be the sole location of such black holes in the absence of\ncosmic scatter. Because of this bias, Mbh will typically appear to be too large\nin the distant sample for a given L or sigma.

This\nis in contrast to the assumption of hole doping into planar Cu dx2-y2 and O\npsigma orbitals as in the t-J model. Interaction of holes with the d9 spin\nbackground leads to chiral polarons with either a clockwise or anti-clockwise\ncharge current. When the polaron plaquettes percolate through the crystal at\nx~0.05 for LaSrCuO, a Cu dx2-y2 and planar O psigma band is formed. Spin\nexchange Coulomb repulsion with chiral polarons leads to D-wave\nsuperconductivity. The equivalent of the Debye energy in phonon\nsuperconductivity is the maximum energy separation between a chiral polaron and\nits time-reversed partner. An additive skew-scattering contribution to the Hall\neffect is induced by chiral polarons and leads to a temperature dependent Hall\neffect that fits the measured values for LaSrCuO. The integrated imaginary\nsusceptibility satisfies omega/T scaling due to chirality and spin-flip\nscattering of polarons along with a uniform distribution of polaron energy\nsplittings.

By assuming\nthe well-tested homologous 1/r^{2} profile for the total density distribution\nin the lens elliptical galaxies, these two mass measurements can be properly\ncompared. Thus, a relation between the Einstein angle and the central stellar\nvelocity dispersion is derived, and the cosmological matter and the dark-energy\ndensity parameters can be estimated from this.

In this paper we select\na large sample of centrals and satellites from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\n(SDSS) and measure the kinematics (velocity dispersions) of the satellite\ngalaxies as a function of the $r$-band luminosity of the central galaxies.\nUsing the analytical framework presented in Paper I, we use these data to infer\n{\\it both} the mean and the scatter of the MLR of central galaxies, carefully\ntaking account of selection effects and biases introduced by the stacking\nprocedure. As expected, brighter centrals on average reside in more massive\nhaloes.

Our result is based on a sample of 6 planets\ndetected from intensive follow-up of high-mag (A>200) microlensing events\nduring 2005-8. The sample host stars have typical mass M_host 0.5 Msun, and\ndetection is sensitive to planets over a range of projected separations\n(R_E/s_max,R_E*s_max), where R_E 3.5 AU sqrt(M_host/Msun) is the Einstein\nradius and s_max (q/5e-5)^{2/3}, corresponding to deprojected separations ~3\ntimes the \"snow line\". Though frenetic, the observations constitute a\n\"controlled experiment\", which permits measurement of absolute planet\nfrequency. High-mag events are rare, but the high-mag channel is efficient:\nhalf of high-mag events were successfully monitored and half of these yielded\nplanet detections. The planet frequency derived from microlensing is a factor 7\nlarger than from RV studies at factor ~25 smaller separations [2<P<2000 days].\nHowever, this difference is basically consistent with the gradient derived from\nRV studies (when extrapolated well beyond the separations from which it is\nmeasured).

We find an extra contribution to the vacuum energy in comparison\nwith Minkowski space time with metric ds^2= dt^2-dx^2. This extra contribution\ncan be traced to the unphysical degrees of freedom (in Minkowski space). The\ntechnical reason for this effect to occur is the property of Bogolubov's\ncoefficients which mix the positive and negative frequencies modes. The\ncorresponding mixture can not be avoided because the projections to positive\n-frequency modes with respect to Minkowski time t and positive -frequency modes\nwith respect to the Rindler observer's proper time \\eta are not equivalent. The\nexact cancellation of unphysical degrees of freedom which is maintained in\nMinkowski space can not hold in the Rindler space. In BRST approach this effect\nmanifests itself as the presence of BRST charge density in L and R parts. An\ninertial observer in Minkowski vacuum |0> observes a universe with no net BRST\ncharge only as a result of cancellation between the two.

This\nis consistent with recent theoretical works, which indicate that the tidal Q of\nplanet-hosting stars can indeed be much larger than the values inferred from\nstellar binaries. On the other hand, recent measurements of Rossiter-McLaughlin\neffects in transiting hot Jupiter systems not only reveal that many such\nsystems have misaligned stellar spin with respect to the orbital axis, but also\nshow that systems with cooler host stars tend to have aligned spin and orbital\naxes. Winn et al. suggested that this obliquity - temperature correlation may\nbe explained by efficient damping of stellar obliquity due to tidal dissipation\nin the star. This explanation, however, is in apparent contradiction with the\nsurvival of these short-period hot Jupiters. We show that in the solar-type\nparent stars of close-in exoplanetary systems, the effective tidal Q governing\nthe damping of stellar obliquity can be much smaller than that governing\norbital decay. This is because for misaligned systems, the tidal potential\ncontains a Fourier component with frequency equal to the stellar spin frequency\n(in the rotating frame of the star). This component can excite inertial waves\nin the convective envelope of the star, and the dissipation of inertial waves\nthen leads to a spin-orbit alignment torque, but not orbital decay. By\ncontrast, for aligned systems, such inertial wave excitation is forbidden since\nthe tidal forcing frequency is much larger than the stellar spin frequency. We\nderive a general effective tidal evolution theory for misaligned binaries,\ntaking account of different tidal responses and dissipation rates for different\ntidal forcing components. \n\n"}

One\ndifficulty, however, is that with the short exposure time ($\\simeq$15 seconds)\nproposed, the spatial variation of the Point Spread Function (PSF) shapes may\nbe dominated by the atmosphere, in addition to optics errors. While optics\nerrors mainly cause the PSF to vary on angular scales similar or larger than a\nsingle CCD sensor, the atmosphere generates stochastic structures on a wide\nrange of angular scales. It thus becomes a challenge to infer the multi-scale,\ncomplex atmospheric PSF patterns by interpolating the sparsely sampled stars in\nthe field. In this paper we present a new method, PSFent, for interpolating the\nPSF shape parameters, based on reconstructing underlying shape parameter maps\nwith a multi-scale maximum entropy algorithm. We demonstrate, using images from\nthe LSST Photon Simulator, the performance of our approach relative to a\n5th-order polynomial fit (representing the current standard) and a simple\nboxcar smoothing technique.

This\nmodel postulates a starburst following each major merger, lasting for a time\nt_SF and converting at most f_star of galactic gas into stars. We include a\nsimple physical prescription for supernovae feedback that suppresses star\nformation in low mass galaxies. Constraining t_SF and f_star to describe the\nobserved star formation rate density at high redshifts, we find that individual\nstarbursts were terminated after a time t_SF~10^7 years. This is comparable to\nthe main-sequence lifetimes of supernova progenitors, indicating that high\nredshift starbursts are quenched once supernovae feedback had time to develop.\nHigh redshift galaxies convert ~10% of their mass into stars for galaxies with\nstar formation rates above ~1 solar mass per year, but a smaller fraction for\nlower luminosity galaxies.

We show that the number of galaxies with high velocity\ndispersions appears to be surprisingly stable with time, regardless of their\nstar formation history.

These systems contain three to five\nspectroscopic galaxies that lie within 500kpc in projected distance (in\nphysical space) and within 700km/s in velocity.

Although few of the \"member\"\ngalaxies are likely to reside in the same halo at the epoch we observe them,\n50% of the systems will eventually bring them all into the same halo, and\nalmost all (93%) will have at least part of the member galaxies in the same\nhalo by the present epoch.

It can be\nmany times larger than the Newtonian force and their ratio is in principle\nunbound. This is very different from the case in halos, where the fifth force\nis no more than 1/3 of gravity. The evolution of voids is governed by the\nNewtonian gravity, the effective dark energy force and the fifth force. While\nthe first two forces are common in both LCDM and chameleon universes, the fifth\nforce is unique to the latter. Driven by the outward-pointing fifth force,\nindividual voids in chameleon models expand faster and grow larger than in a\nLCDM universe. The expansion velocity of the void shell can be 20% to 30%\nlarger for voids of a few Mpc/h in radius, while their sizes can be larger by\n~10%. These differences are smaller for larger voids of the same density. We\ncompare void statistics using excursion set theory; for voids of the same size,\ntheir number density is larger in chameleon models. The fractional difference\nincreases with void size. The chance of having voids of radius ~25 Mpc/h can be\n2.5 times larger. This difference is about 10 times larger than that in the\nhalo mass function.

Our approach allows us to\ncalculate spin-dependent $Q\\bar{Q}$ potentials, e.g. the spin-spin potential,\nas well. In order to investigate several systematic uncertainties on such\n$Q\\bar{Q}$ potentials, we carry out lattice QCD simulations using quenched\ngauge configurations generated with the single plaquette gauge action with\nthree different lattice spacings, $a \\approx$ 0.093, 0.068 and 0.047 fm, and\ntwo different physical volumes, $L \\approx$ 2.2 and 3.0 fm.

The two classifications\nagree in about 70% of the objects, and the remaining 30% can be further\nsubdivided into two distinct classes: at low luminosities X-ray un-obscured AGN\ndo not always show signs of broad lines or blue/UV continuum emission in their\noptical spectra, most likely due to galaxy dilution effects; at high\nluminosities broad line AGN may have absorbed X-ray spectra, which hints at an\nincreased incidence of small-scale (sub-parsec) dust-free obscuration.

Based on the delta-N formalism, we\nanalyze the cosmological perturbations for the first time in the full two-field\nmodel, also taking into account the fast-roll dynamics at and after the end of\ninflation. As a consequence of the two-field nature of hybrid inflation, the\npredictions for the primordial fluctuations depend not only on the parameters\nof the Lagrangian, but are eventually fixed by the choice of the inflationary\ntrajectory.

Abstract: The entropic approach to dissociation of bound states immersed in strongly\ncoupled systems is developed. In such systems, the excitations of the bound\nstate are often delocalized and characterized by a large entropy, so that the\nbound state is strongly entangled with the rest of the statistical system. If\nthis entropy $S$ increases with the separation $r$ between the constituents of\nthe bound state, $S = S(r)$, then the resulting entropic force $F = T\\\n{\\partial S}/{\\partial r}$ ($T$ is temperature) can drive the dissociation\nprocess. As a specific example, we consider the case of heavy quarkonium in\nstrongly coupled quark-gluon plasma, where lattice QCD indicates a large amount\nof entropy associated with the heavy quark pair at temperatures $0.9\\ T_c \\leq\nT \\leq 1.5\\ T_c$ ($T_c$ is the deconfinement temperature); this entropy $S(r)$\ngrows with the inter-quark distance $r$. We argue that the entropic mechanism\nresults in an anomalously strong quarkonium suppression in the temperature\nrange near $T_c$. This \"entropic self-destruction\" may thus explain why the\nexperimentally measured quarkonium nuclear modification factor at RHIC (lower\nenergy density) is smaller than at LHC (higher energy density), possibly\nresolving the \"quarkonium suppression puzzle\" - all of the previously known\nmechanisms of quarkonium dissociation operate more effectively at higher energy\ndensities, and this contradicts the data. Moreover, we find that near $T_c$ the\nentropic force leads to delocalization of the bound hadron states; we argue\nthat this delocalization may be the mechanism underlying deconfinement. \n\n"}

These 'IR/UV' relations are rooted in basic physical\nprinciples, such as causality and unitarity. In this paper, we seek similar\nconnections in inflation, relating cosmological observations to the physics\nresponsible for the accelerated expansion. We assume that the inflationary\ntheory is Lorentz invariant at short distances, but allow for non-relativistic\ninteractions and a non-trivial speed of propagation at low energies. Focusing\non forward scattering, we derive a 'sum rule' which equates a combination of\nlow-energy parameters to an integral which is sensitive to the high-energy\nbehavior of the theory. While for relativistic amplitudes unitarity is\nsufficient to prove positivity of the sum rule, this is not guaranteed in the\nnon-relativistic case.

We oppose this opinion\nand show that two main factors are responsible for the extremely low intensity\nof the observed stellar EBL: (1) a low mean surface brightness of galaxies,\nwhich causes a low luminosity density in the local Universe, and (2) light\nextinction due to absorption by galactic and intergalactic dust. Dust produces\na partial opacity of galaxies and of the Universe. The galactic opacity reduces\nthe intensity of light from more distant background galaxies obscured by\nforeground galaxies. The effective extinction AV for light passing through a\ngalaxy is 0.2 mag. This causes that distant background galaxies do not\ncontribute to the EBL significantly. In addition, light of distant galaxies is\ndimmed due to absorption by intergalactic dust. Even a minute intergalactic\nopacity of 1x10^(-2) mag per Gpc is high enough to produce significant effects\non the EBL. The absorbed starlight heats up the galactic and intergalactic dust\nand is further re-radiated at the IR, FIR and micro-wave spectrum. Assuming\nstatic infinite universe with no galactic and intergalactic dust, the stellar\nEBL should be as high as the surface brightness of stars. However, if dust is\nconsidered, the predicted stellar EBL is about 290 nWm^(-2)sr^(-1), which is\nonly 5 times higher than the observed value. Hence, the presence of dust has\nhigher impact on the EBL than currently assumed. In the expanding universe, the\ncalculated value of the EBL is further decreased, because the obscuration\neffect and intergalactic absorption become more pronounced at high redshifts\nwhen the matter was concentrated at smaller volume than at present. \n\n"}

We\nperform a suite of 3D MHD AMR simulations of AGN feedback in a cool core\ncluster including cosmic ray (CR) physics. CRs are supplied to the ICM via\ncollimated AGN jets and subsequently disperse in the magnetized ICM via\nstreaming, and interact with the ICM via hadronic, Coulomb, and streaming\ninstability heating. We find that CR transport is an essential model ingredient\nneeded for AGN feedback to self-regulate, at least within the context of the\nphysical model considered here. When CR streaming is neglected, the suppression\nof CR mixing with the ICM by magnetic fields significantly reduces ICM heating,\nwhich leads to cooling catastrophes. In the opposite case, CRs come into\ncontact with the ambient ICM and efficiently heat it, which results in globally\nstable atmospheres. Moreover, the dynamical state and intermittency of the\ncentral AGN are dramatically altered when CR streaming is present. We find that\nCR streaming heating dominates over the heating due to Coulomb and hadronic\nprocesses. Importantly, in simulations that include CR streaming, CR pressure\nsupport in the central 100 kpc is very low and does not demonstrably violate\nobservational constraints. On the contrary, when CR streaming is neglected, CR\nenergy is not spent on the ICM heating and CR pressure builds up to the level\nthat is in disagreement with the data. Overall, our models demonstrate that CR\nheating is a viable channel for the thermalization of AGN energy in clusters,\nand likely also in elliptical galaxies, and that CRs play an important role in\ndetermining AGN intermittency and the dynamical state of cool core atmospheres. \n\n"}

Here we introduce\nthe Spectral Approach to TTVs technique that allows expanding the TTVs catalog\ntowards lower TTV amplitude, shorter orbital period, and shallower transit\ndepth.

This enables detection of TTVs even in cases where\nthe transits are too shallow so individual transits cannot be timed.

Assuming that bunches are already generated in pulsar\nmagnetospheres, we calculate the spectrum of coherent curvature radiation under\na three-dimensional magnetic field geometry.

In the nonlinear regime, magnetic twist affects the\ndevelopment of shear instabilities that appear at the tube boundary when it is\noscillating laterally. These Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities (KHI) are produced\neither by the jump in the azimuthal component of the velocity at the edge of\nthe sharp boundary between the internal and external part of the tube, or\neither by the continuous small length-scales produced by phase-mixing when\nthere is a smooth inhomogeneous layer.

In this paper, we investigate the\nhypothesis that only certain mass accretion rates result in detectable bandhead\nemission in the near infrared spectra of MYSOs. Using an analytic disc model\ncombined with an LTE model of the CO emission, we find that high accretion\nrates ($\\gtrsim 10^{-4}\\,{\\rm M}_{\\odot}{\\mathrm{yr}}^{-1}$) result in large\ndust sublimation radii, a larger contribution to the $K$-band continuum from\nhot dust at the dust sublimation radius, and therefore correspondingly lower CO\nemission with respect to the continuum.

Abstract: Two major challenges to unification schemes for active galactic nuclei (AGN)\nare the existence of Narrow-Line Seyfert 1s (NLS1s) and the existence of\nchanging-look (CL) AGNs. AGNs can drastically change their spectral appearance\nin the optical (changing their Seyfert type) and/or in the X-ray region. We\nillustrate the CL phenomenon with our multi-wavelength monitoring of NGC 2617\nand discuss its properties compared with NLS1s. There are few examples of CL\nNLS1s and the changes are mostly only in the X-ray region. It has been proposed\nthat some of these could be cases of a tidal-disruption events (TDE) or\nsupernova events. If BLRs have a flat geometry and NLS1s are seen face-on then\nwe have to see CL cases only if the orientation of the BLR changes as a result\nof a TDE or a close encounter of a star without a TDE. If NLS1s include both\nhigh Eddington accretion rate and low-inclination AGNs then a significant\nfraction of NLS1s could be obscured and would not be identified as NLS1s.

Current fashionable supersymmetric models provide a\nnatural dark matter candidate which is the lightest supersymmetric particle\n(LSP). Such models combined with fairly well understood physics like the quark\nsubstructure of the nucleon and the nuclear form factor and the spin response\nfunction of the nucleus, permit the evaluation of the event rate for\nLSP-nucleus elastic scattering. The thus obtained event rates are, however,\nvery low or even undetectable. So it is imperative to exploit the modulation\neffect, i.e. the dependence of the event rate on the earth's annual motion. In\nthis review we study such a modulation effect in directional and undirectional\nexperiments. We calculate both the differential and the total rates using\nsymmetric as well as asymmetric velocity distributions. We find that in the\nsymmetric case the modulation amplitude is small, less than 0.07. There exist,\nhowever, regions of the phase space and experimental conditions such that the\neffect can become larger. The inclusion of asymmetry, with a realistic enhanced\nvelocity dispersion in the galactocentric direction, yields the bonus of an\nenhanced modulation effect, with an amplitude which for certain parameters can\nbecome as large as 0.46. \n\n"}

Furthermore, the sublimation\ndistance is a decreasing function of grain size, while the fragmentation\ndistance is a decreasing function of grain size for large grains and an\nincreasing function of grain size for small grains. We investigate how these\nvery different, but somewhat complementary, processes change the optical depth\nof the circumburst medium. To this end, we adopt a canonical distribution of\ngraphite and silicate grain sizes, and a simple fragmentation model, and we\ncompute the post-burst/optical flash/afterglow optical depth of a circumburst\ncloud of constant density n and size R as a function of burst and afterglow\nisotropic-equivalent X-ray energy E and spectral index alpha, and optical flash\nisotropic-equivalent peak luminosity L: This improves upon previous analyses\nthat consider circumburst dust of a uniform grain size.

We show\nthat, for ages 6 <= log(age/yr) <= 9, and if one can only obtain partial\ncoverage of the spectral energy distribution (SED), an optical passband\ncombination of at least four filters including BOTH blue AND red passbands\nresults in the most representative age distribution. We find that while\nblue-selected passband combinations lead to age distributions that are slightly\nbiased towards younger ages due to the age-metallicity degeneracy,\nred-dominated passband combinations should be avoided. NGC 3310 underwent a\nglobal burst of cluster formation ~3x10^7 yr ago. This coincides closely with\nthe last tidal interaction or merger with a low-metallicity galaxy that likely\ninduced the formation of the large fraction of clusters with (significantly)\nsubsolar metallicities.

Special\nrelativistic aberration due to the orbital motion of pulsar changes both the\nlongitude and colatitude of the emission direction with respect to the pulsar\nspin axis. The former gives rise to a shift of the arrival time of the pulse\ncentroid (this is the conventional ``longitudinal'' aberration delay), the\nlatter results in a distortion (contraction or dilation) of the pulse profile\non the orbital timescale. The amplitude of pulse distortion depends inversely\non the variation of polarization position angle across the pulse. For small\nangle between the pulsar magnetic and spin axes, as inferred for PSR\nJ0737-3039A from polarimetric observations, the pulse distortion is significant\n(\\sim 1%) and the associated ``latitudinal'' aberration delay is much larger\nthan the longitudinal one. By monitoring the arrival time of separate pulse\ncomponents as a function of pulsar orbital phase, the latitudinal aberration\ndelay may be easily measured with the current timing precision, thus\nconstraining the spin geometry of the system. The latitudinal delay can also be\ndetected by monitoring system's orbital parameters on the geodetic precession\ntimescale. Because of the near edge-on orbital orientation of the PSR\nJ0737-3039 system, general relativistic bending of pulsar A's radio beam near\nits superior conjunction also introduces spin-dependent time delays of similar\norder of magnitude as the aberration delays. In addition, light bending splits\nthe pulse profile into two variable components, corresponding to two\ngravitationally lensed images of the source.

After accounting for the mass of hot\ngas, the resulting mass profiles are described well by a two-component model\nconsisting of dark matter (DM), represented by an NFW model, and stars from the\ncentral galaxy.

We investigate where new\nand previously-known sources detected by ISGRI fit in the parameter space of\nhigh-energy objects, and we use the parameters to test correlations expected\nfrom theoretical predictions.

We examine the spatial\ndistribution of different types of sources in the Milky Way using various\nprojections of the Galactic plane, in order to highlight signatures of stellar\nevolution and to speculate on the origin of the group of sources whose\nclassifications are still uncertain.

These manifolds can be\nconsidered as prototypes of the so called Zeeman manifolds. This observation\nallows to develop a spectral theory both on open Z-manifolds and their compact\nsubmanifolds. The theory on open manifolds leads to a new nonperturbative\napproach to the infinities of QED. This idea exploits that the quantum Hilbert\nspace decomposes into subspaces (Zeeman zones) which are invariant under the\nactions both of this Zeeman-Laplace operator and the natural complex Heisenberg\ngroup representation. Thus a well defined particle theory and zonal geometry\ncan be developed on each zone separately. The most surprising result is that\nquantities divergent on the global setting are finite on the zonal setting.\nEven the zonal Feynman integral is well defined. The results include explicit\ncomputations of objects such as the zonal spectra, the waves defining the zonal\npoint-spreads, the zonal Wiener-Kac resp. Dirac-Feynman flows, and the\ncorresponding partition functions.\n  The observation adds new view-point also to the problem of finding\nintertwining operators by which isospectral pairs of metrics with different\nlocal geometries on compact submanifolds can be constructed. Among the examples\nthe author constructed the most surprising are the isospectrality families\ncontaining both homogeneous and locally inhomogeneous metrics. The observation\nprovides even quantum physical interpretation to the isospectrality. \n\n"}

The weak dependence of the equation of\nstate on the symmetry energy is shown as the main reason of this finding. Using\ndifferent RMF models the dynamical instabilities of uniform matters, with and\nwithout neutrino trapping, have been also studied. The interplay between the\ndominant contribution of the variation of matter composition and the role of\neffective masses of mesons and nucleons leads to higher critical densities for\nmatter with neutrino trapping.
