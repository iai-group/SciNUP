Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on\nthe role that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in\nglobular clusters, e.g., influencing the distribution of horizontal branch\nstars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of some globular clusters, and in\nforming low mass white dwarfs. \n\n"}

As young AGN\n(quasars) they are initially several magnitudes sub-luminous to mature galaxies\nbut their luminosity gradually increases over 10^8 yrs, as z_(i) decreases and\nthey evolve into mature AGN (Seyferts and radio galaxies). Evidence presented\nhere that low- and intermediate-redshift AGN are unquestionably sub-luminous to\nradio galaxies is then strong support for this model and makes it likely that\nthe high-redshift AGN (quasars) are also sub-luminous, having simply been\npushed above the radio galaxies on a logz-m_(v) plot by the presence of a large\nintrinsic component in their redshifts.

The number ratios are measured\nindirectly in the simulations due to their resolution limitations. Our approach\ncontains one free parameter, the lifetime of a protostellar object t_yso (Class\n0 + Class I stages), which is outside the realm of the simulations. Assuming a\nvalue t_yso = 0.46 Myr, we obtain number ratios of starless to stellar cores\nranging from 4-5 at n_thr = 1.5 x 10^4 cm^-3 to 1 at n_thr = 1.2 x 10^5 cm^-3,\nagain in good agreement with observational determinations.

The numerical models exhibit\nhighly collimated magnetically-driven jets very early on. The jets are\nsuper-Alfvenic but remain sub-fast until the end of the simulations (t=0.2s).\nThe power released in the jets is about 3x10^{50}erg/s which implies the\nspin-down time of ~37s. The total rotational energy of the magnetar,\nE~10^{52}erg, is sufficient to drive hypernova but it is not clear as to how\nlarge a fraction of this energy can be transfered to the stellar envelope.\nGiven the observed propagation speed of the jets, v_p~0.17c, they are expected\nto traverse the progenitor in few seconds and after this most of the released\nrotational energy would be simply carried away by these jets into the\nsurrounding space. Our results provide the first more or less self-consistent\nnumerical model of a central engine capable of producing, in the supernova\nsetting and on a long-term basis, collimated jets with sufficient power to\nexplain long duration GRBs and their afterglows. Although the flow speed of our\njets is relatively low, v_j~0.5c$, the cooling of proto-neutron star will\neventually result in much higher magnetization of its magnetospheres and\nultra-relativistic asymptotic speeds of the jets. Given the relatively long\ncooling time-scale we still expect the jets to be only weakly relativistic by\nthe time of break out. This leads to a model of GRB jets with systematic\nlongitudinal variation of Lorentz factor which may have specific observational\nsignatures both in the prompt and the afterglow emission. \n\n"}

(3) OHM hosts have exceptionally high\ndense molecular gas fractions, L(HCN)/L(CO)>0.07, and comprise roughly half of\nthis unusual population. OH absorbers and kilomasers generally follow the\nlinear IR-CO relation and are uniformly distributed in dense gas fraction and\nL(HCN), demonstrating that OHMs are independent of OH abundance. The fraction\nof non-OHMs with high mean densities and high dense gas fractions constrains\nbeaming to be a minor effect: OHM emission solid angle must exceed 2 pi\nsteradians. Contrary to conventional wisdom, IR luminosity does not dictate OHM\nformation; both star formation and OHM activity are consequences of tidal\ndensity enhancements accompanying galaxy interactions.

Four\nof the objects exhibit X-ray spectra indicative of a hard excess, consistent\nwith a heavily obscured X-ray component and hence a hidden nucleus. In these\nobjects the softer X-rays may be dominated by a strong soft scattered continuum\nor contamination from the host galaxy, which is responsible for the unabsorbed\nX-ray spectra observed, and accounts for the anomalously low 2-10 keV X-ray\nluminosity. We confirm this assertion in NGC4501 with a Chandra observation,\nwhich shows hard X-ray emission coincident with the nucleus, consistent with\nheavy absorption, and a number of contaminating softer sources which account\nfor the bulk of the softer emission. We point out that such 'Compton thick'\nsources need not necessarily present iron Ka emission of high EW.

Using this rule and attributing all Fe production\nto normal SNe, we previously developed a phenomenological two-component model,\nwhich predicts that [Sr/Fe] > -0.32 for all metal-poor stars. This is in direct\nconflict with the high-resolution data now available, which show that there is\na great shortfall of Sr relative to Fe in many stars with [Fe/H] < -3.

We use the minimal\nparity-symmetric extension of the standard model, which implies that the\nmicrophysics is the same in the two sectors. We find that the mass-radius\nrelation is significantly modified in the presence of a few percent mirror\nbaryons. This effect mimics that of other exotica, e.g., quark matter.

This difference provides a useful diagnostic for immediate\niscrimination of a planet-induced perturbation from that induced by a binary\ncompanion, where the absence of a well-developed dip in the residual from the\nsingle-lensing light curve at both or either of the moments of the caustic\ncenter's entrance into and exit from the source star surface indicates that the\nperturbation is produced by a planetary companion. We find that that this\ndifference is basically caused by the difference between the shapes of the\ncentral caustics induced by the two different types of companions. \n\n"}

Likelihood\nand Bayesian estimation are applied to a local non-linear perturbed model up to\nthird order, characterized by a linear term which is described by a Gaussian\nN-pdf, and a second and third order terms which are proportional to the square\nand the cube of the linear one.

As an application, we consider the analysis\nof the WMAP 5-year data at a resolution of around 2 degrees. At this angular\nscale (the Sachs-Wolfe regime), the non-Gaussian description proposed in this\nwork defaults (under certain conditions) to an approximative local form of the\nweak non-linear coupling inflationary model (e.g. Komatsu & Spergel 2001)\npreviously addressed in the literature.

In particular, the outer Galactic halo contains GCs with redder HBs\nat a given metallicity than are found inside the Solar circle.

Expanding the sample to\ninclude HST photometry of the 6 most distant Galactic GCs lends additional\nsupport to the correlation between d(V-I) and age.

Iron, Magnesium, and Silicon Abstract: We use thermochemical equilibrium calculations to model iron, magnesium, and\nsilicon chemistry in the atmospheres of giant planets, brown dwarfs, extrasolar\ngiant planets (EGPs), and low-mass stars. The behavior of individual Fe-, Mg-,\nand Si-bearing gases and condensates is determined as a function of\ntemperature, pressure, and metallicity. Our results are thus independent of any\nparticular model atmosphere. The condensation of Fe metal strongly affects iron\nchemistry by efficiently removing Fe-bearing species from the gas phase.\nMonatomic Fe is the most abundant Fe-bearing gas throughout the atmospheres of\nEGPs and L dwarfs and in the deep atmospheres of giant planets and T dwarfs.\nMg- and Si-bearing gases are effectively removed from the atmosphere by\nforsterite (Mg2SiO4) and enstatite (MgSiO3) cloud formation. Monatomic Mg is\nthe dominant magnesium gas throughout the atmospheres of EGPs and L dwarfs and\nin the deep atmospheres of giant planets and T dwarfs.

Our simple model of\nthe reflection effect takes into account the reflection (scattering), heating\nand heat redistribution over the surface of the irradiated object.

The angular resolution of the maps is as high as\n0.15arcsec, or 20AU at the distance of the Taurus cloud, which is a factor of 2\nhigher than has been achieved to date at these wavelengths. The unprecedented\ndetail of the resulting disk images enables us to address three important\nquestions related to the formation of planets. (1) What is the radial\ndistribution of the circumstellar dust? (2) Does the dust emission show any\nindication of gaps that might signify the presence of (proto-)planets? (3) Do\nthe dust properties depend on the orbital radius? We find that modeling the\ndisk surface density in terms of either a classical power law or the similarity\nsolution for viscous disk evolution, reproduces the observations well. The\n1.3mm image from RYTau shows two peaks separated by 0.2arcsec with a decline in\nthe dust emission toward the stellar position, which is significant at about\n2-4sigma. For both RYTau and DGTau, the dust emission at radii larger than 15\nAU displays no significant deviation from an unperturbed viscous disk model. In\nparticular, no radial gaps in the dust distribution are detected. Under\nreasonable assumptions, we exclude the presence of planets more massive than 5\nJupiter masses orbiting either star at distances between about 10 and 60 AU.\nThe radial variation of the dust opacity slope, beta, was investigated by\ncomparing the 1.3mm and 2.8mm observations.

As a\nquantum theory the conformal theory is both renormalizable and unitary, with\nunitarity being obtained because the theory is a $PT$ symmetric rather than a\nHermitian theory. We show that in the theory there can be no a priori classical\ncurvature, with all curvature having to result from quantization. In the\nconformal theory gravity requires no independent quantization of its own, with\nit being quantized solely by virtue of its being coupled to a quantized matter\nsource. Moreover, because it is this very coupling that fixes the strength of\nthe gravitational field commutators, the gravity sector zero-point energy\ndensity and pressure fluctuations are then able to identically cancel the\nzero-point fluctuations associated with the matter sector. In addition, we show\nthat when the conformal symmetry is spontaneously broken, the zero-point\nstructure automatically readjusts so as to identically cancel the cosmological\nconstant term that dynamical mass generation induces. We show that the\nmacroscopic classical theory that results from the quantum conformal theory\nincorporates global physics effects that provide for a detailed accounting of a\ncomprehensive set of 138 galactic rotation curves with no adjustable parameters\nother than the galactic mass to light ratios, and with the need for no dark\nmatter whatsoever.

However, a survey of published pre-maximum spectra reveals that more SNe\nIa than previously thought may exhibit C II 6580 absorption features and relics\nof line blending near 6300 Angstroms. Here we present new SN Ia observations\nwhere spectroscopic signatures of C II 6580 are detected, and investigate the\npresence of C II 6580 in the optical spectra of 19 SNe Ia using the\nparameterized spectrum synthesis code, SYNOW. Most of the objects in our sample\nthat exhibit C II 6580 absorption features are of the low-velocity gradient\nsubtype. Our study indicates that the morphology of carbon-rich regions is\nconsistent with either a spherical distribution or a hemispheric asymmetry,\nsupporting the recent idea that SN Ia diversity may be a result of off-center\nignition coupled with observer line-of-sight effects. \n\n"}

Measurement of this anisotropy by future 21cm surveys is a\npromising tool for separating cosmology from 21cm astrophysics. However,\nprevious attempts to model the signal have often neglected peculiar velocity or\nonly approximated it crudely. This paper re-examines the effects of peculiar\nvelocity on the 21cm signal in detail, improving upon past treatment and\naddressing several issues for the first time. (1) We show that properly\naccounting for finite optical depth eliminates the unphysical divergence of\n21cm brightness temperature in overdense regions of the IGM found by previous\nwork that employed the usual optically-thin approximation. (2) The\napproximation made previously to circumvent the diverging brightness\ntemperature problem by capping velocity gradient can misestimate the power\nspectrum on all scales. (3) The observed power spectrum in redshift-space\nremains finite even in the optically-thin approximation if one properly\naccounts for the redshift-space distortion. However, results that take full\naccount of finite optical depth show that this approximation is only accurate\nin the limit of high spin temperature. (4) The linear theory for redshift-space\ndistortion results in ~30% error in the observationally relevant wavenumber\nrange, at the 50% ionized epoch. (5) We describe and test two numerical schemes\nto calculate the 21cm signal from reionization simulations to incorporate\npeculiar velocity effects in the optically-thin approximation accurately. One\nis particle-based, the other grid-based, and while the former is most accurate,\nwe demonstrate that the latter is computationally more efficient and can\nachieve sufficient accuracy.

Since the interior of neutron stars has high pressure and as their\nmass and radius can be measured observationally, they are the perfect\nlaboratory for testing the validity of the aether theory.

However, some recent observations showed that the expected number\nof the mass-accreting WD is much lower than that predicted from theory,\nwhatever in spiral or elliptical galaxies. In this paper, we did a binary\npopulation synthesis study on the relative duration of the SSS phase to their\nwhole mass-increasing phase of WDs leading to SNe Ia. We found that for about\n40% progenitor systems, the relative duration is shorter than 2% and the\nevolution of the mean relative duration shows that it is always smaller than\n5%, whatever for young or old SNe Ia.

The rate of orbital decay never drops precisely to zero, because\nstars moving faster than the test body also contribute to the frictional force.\nWhen the contribution from the fast-moving stars is included in the expression\nfor the dynamical friction force, and the changes induced by the massive body\non the stellar distribution are taken into account, Chandrasekhar's theory is\nfound to reproduce the rate of orbital decay remarkably well. However, this\nrate is still substantially smaller than the rate predicted by Chandrasekhar's\nformula in its most widely-used forms, implying longer time scales for\ninspiral. Motivated by recent observations that suggest a parsec-scale core\naround the Galactic center SMBH, we investigate the evolution of a population\nof stellar-mass black holes (BHs) as they spiral in to the center of the\nGalaxy. After ~10Gyr, we find that the density of BHs can remain substantially\nless than the density in stars at all radii; we conclude that it would be\nunjustified to assume that the spatial distribution of BHs at the Galactic\ncenter is well described by steady-state models. One consequence is that rates\nof capture of BHs by the SMBH at the Galactic center (EMRIs) may be much lower\nthan in standard models. We finally study the orbital decay of satellite\ngalaxies into the central region of giant ellipticals and discuss the formation\nof multiple nuclei and multiplet of black holes in such systems. \n\n"}

The aim of\nthis work is to search for the imprint of the environment on the chemical\nevolution of these galaxies.

The slope of these\nsequences, for galaxies in low-mass clusters and galaxies at large\ncluster-centric distances, follows the predictions of recent hydrodynamic\nmodels. A flattening of this slope has been observed for galaxies located in\nthe core of the two more massive clusters of the sample, principally in Coma,\nsuggesting that the imprint of the cluster environment on the chemical\nevolution of SF galaxies should be sensitive to both the galaxy mass and the\nhost cluster mass.

Our Roche tomograms of the secondary star show\nprominent irradiation of the inner Lagrangian point due to illumination by the\ndisc and/or bright spot, which may have been enhanced as RU Peg was in outburst\nat the time of our observations.We find that this irradiation pattern is\naxi-symmetric and confined to regions of the star which have a direct view of\nthe accretion regions. This is in contrast to previous attempts to map RU Peg\nwhich suggested that the irradiation pattern was non-symmetric and extended\nbeyond the terminator. We also detect additional inhomogeneities in the surface\ndistribution of stellar atomic absorption that we ascribe to the presence of a\nlarge star-spot. This spot is centred at a latitude of about 82 degrees and\ncovers approximately 4 per cent of the total surface area of the secondary. In\nkeeping with the high latitude spots mapped on the cataclysmic variables AE Aqr\nand BV Cen, the spot on RU Peg also appears slightly shifted towards the\ntrailing hemisphere of the star. Finally, we speculate that early mapping\nattempts which indicated non-symmetric irradiation patterns which extended\nbeyond the terminator of CV donors could possibly be explained by a\nsuperposition of symmetric heating and a large spot. \n\n"}

Models in which the\ncontinuum above 10 keV is dominated by the direct (unscattered) continuum or\nCompton-scattered continuum give the highest and lowest intrinsic luminosities\nrespectively. Variability properties favor solutions in which the unscattered\ncontinuum dominates above 10 keV.

In addition, we\nconfirm (with new and archival HST data) the presence of a split SGB in 47Tuc,\nNGC 1851, and NGC 6388.

This indicates that the bright L'-band IRS13N sources\nare indeed dust enshrouded stars rather than core-less dust clouds.

This\nformula approximates well more cumbersome expressions obtained from the fit\nwith numerical simulations. By integrating over all equally likely orientations\nfor precessing mergers we determine a lower approximant to the final spin\ndistribution as function of the mass ratio alone.

Abstract: The lightcurve of the explosion of a star with a radius <10-100Rsun is\npowered mostly by radioactive decay. Observationally such events are dominated\nby hydrogen deficient progenitors and classified as Type I supernovae: white\ndwarf thermonuclear explosions (Type Ia) and core collapses of\nhydrogen-stripped massive stars (Type Ibc). Transient surveys are finding SNe I\nin increasing numbers and at earlier times, allowing their early emission to be\nstudied in unprecedented detail. Motivated by these developments, we summarize\nthe physics that produces their rising lightcurves and discuss how observations\ncan be utilized to study these exploding stars. The early radioactive-powered\nlightcurves probe the shallowest 56Ni deposits. If the amount of 56Ni mixing\ncan be deduced, then it places constraints on the progenitor and properties of\nthe explosive burning. In practice we find it is difficult to disentangle\nwhether the explosion occurred recently and one is seeing 56Ni heating near the\nsurface or whether the explosion began in the past and 56Ni heating is deeper.\nIn the latter case there is a \"dark phase\" between the moment of explosion and\nthe first light observed from the shallowest layers of 56Ni. Because of this,\nsimply extrapolating a lightcurve from 56Ni back in time is not a reliable\nmethod for estimating the explosion time. The best solution is to directly\nidentify the moment of explosion, by either observing shock breakout or\nshock-heated surface cooling, so the depth being probed by the rising\nlightcurve is known. Since this is typically not available, we identify other\ndiagnostics that are helpful for deciphering how recently an explosion\noccurred. As an example we apply these arguments to the SN Ic PTF 10vgv. We\ndemonstrate that just a single measurement of the photospheric velocity and\ntemperature during the rise places constraints on its explosion time, radius,\nand 56Ni mixing. \n\n"}

Time-resolved photometric and spectroscopic observations were obtained\nto analyze the behavior of the system between superoutbursts. A geometric model\nof a binary system containing a disk with two outer annuli spiral density waves\nwas applied to explain the light curve and the Doppler tomography. Observations\nwere carried out during 2008-2009, after the object's magnitude decreased to\nV~17.7(0.1) from the March 2006 eruption. The light curve clearly shows a\nsinusoid-like variability with a 0.07 mag amplitude and a 42.48 min\nperiodicity, which is half of the orbital period of the system. In Sept. 2010,\nthe system underwent yet another superoutburst and returned to its quiescent\nlevel by the beginning of 2012. This light curve once again showed a\ndouble-humps, but with a significantly smaller ~0.01mag amplitude. Other types\nof variability like a \"mini-outburst\" or SDSS1238-like features were not\ndetected. Doppler tomograms, obtained from spectroscopic data during the same\nperiod of time, show a large accretion disk with uneven brightness, implying\nthe presence of spiral waves. We constructed a geometric model of a bounce-back\nsystem containing two spiral density waves in the outer annuli of the disk to\nreproduce the observed light curves.

Two sky-target nodding\nstrategies were tested, and we find that strictly minimizing sky sampling\nlatency does not maximize sky subtraction accuracy, which is at best 2% of the\nsky level. The mean surface brightness difference between blocks in our mosaic\ncan be reduced from 1% to 0.1% of the sky brightness by introducing scalar sky\noffsets to each image. The true surface brightness of M31 can be known to\nwithin a statistical zeropoint of 0.15% of the sky level (0.2 mag arcsec sq.\nuncertainty at R=15 kpc).

A previous Chandra observation in 2003 showed a hard X-ray point\nsource of similar luminosity to the 2012 source that was also near the\ndynamical center (~0.4 arcsec); however, this source was offset from the 2012\nsource position by ~1 arcsec. We show that the probability of the 2003 and 2012\nhard X-ray sources being unrelated is >>99.99% based on the Chandra spatial\nlocalizations. Interestingly, the Chandra spectrum of the 2003 source (3-8 keV)\nis shallower in slope than that of the 2012 hard X-ray source. Its proximity to\nthe dynamical center and harder Chandra spectrum indicate that the 2003 source\nis a better AGN candidate than any of the sources detected in our 2012\ncampaign; however, we were unable to rule out a ULX nature for this source.\nFuture NuSTAR and Chandra monitoring would be well equipped to break the\ndegeneracy between the AGN and ULX nature of the 2003 source, if again caught\nin a high state. \n\n"}

The source has large fractional circular polarization, m_c \\equiv |V|/I,\ndetected at high significance across the entire band (from 15 to 90\\sigma per\n128 MHz sub-band).

The fractional linear polarization (p) varies from <~0.2% to\n~1% across our frequency range and is strongly anti-correlated with the\nfractional CP, with a best-fit power law giving m_c \\propto p^{-0.24\\pm0.03}.\nThis is the first clear relation between the observed linear and circular\npolarisations of an AGN jet, revealing the action of Faraday conversion of\nlinear polarization (LP) to CP within the jet.

In this paper, we investigate the effect of linking the\ncircular velocity of galaxies, as determined from the Fundamental Plane and\nTully-Fisher relations, to the slope of the IMF with parameterizations guided\nby several of these studies. For each empirical relation, we generate stellar\nmasses of ~600,000 SDSS galaxies at z ~ 0.1, by fitting the optical photometry\nto large suites of synthetic stellar populations that sample the full range of\ngalaxy parameters. We generate stellar mass functions and examine the\nstellar-to-halo mass relations using sub-halo abundance matching. At the\nmassive end, the stellar mass functions become a power law, instead of the\nfamiliar exponential decline. As a result, it is a generic feature of these\nmodels that the central galaxy stellar-to-halo mass relation is significantly\nflatter at high masses (slope ~ -0.3 to -0.4) than in the case of a universal\nIMF (slope ~ -0.6). We find that regardless of whether the IMF varies\nsystematically in all galaxies or just early types, there is still a\nwell-defined peak in the central stellar-to-halo mass ratio at halo masses of ~\n10E12 solar masses. In general, the IMF variations explored here lead to\nsignificantly higher integrated stellar densities if the assumed dependence on\ncircular velocity applies to all galaxies, including late-types; in fact the\nmore extreme cases can be ruled out, as they imply an unphysical situation in\nwhich the stellar fraction exceeds the universal baryon fraction. \n\n"}

Using a long-simulation box we have followed the\nmagnetic-field amplification until it is fully developed and saturated. The\nturbulent velocity is sub-relativistic even for a strong shock. Magnetic-field\namplification is controled by the turbulent motion and saturation occurs when\nthe magnetic energy is comparable to the turbulent kinetic energy.\nMagnetic-field amplification and saturation depend on the initial strength and\ndirection of the magnetic field in the preshock medium, and on the shock\nstrength.

Several explanations have already been\nconsidered, but the existence of dual tracks is not yet fully understood.\n  We suggest that in the hard spectral state re-condensation of gas from the\ncorona into a cool, weak inner disk can provide additional soft photons for\nComptonization, leading to a higher X-ray luminosity in combination with rather\nunchanged radio emission, which presumably traces the mass accretion rate. As\nan example, we determined how much additional luminosity due to photons from an\nunderlying disk would be needed to explain the data from the representative\noutlier source H1743-322. From the comparison with calculations of Compton\nspectra with and without the photons from an underlying disk, we find that the\nrequired additional X-ray luminosity lies well in the range obtained from\ntheoretical models of the accretion flow. The radio/X-ray luminosity relation\nresulting from Comptonization of additional photons from a weak, cool inner\ndisk during the hard spectral state can explain the observations of the outlier\nsources, especially the data for H1743-322, the source with the most detailed\nobservations.

However, radially self-similar MHD\njet models, in general, have three geometrical shortcomings, (i) a singularity\nat the jet axis, (ii) the necessary assumption of axisymmetry, and (iii) the\nnon-existence of an intrinsic radial scale, i.e. the jets formally extend to\nradial infinity. Hence, numerical simulations are necessary to extend the\nanalytical solutions towards the axis, by solving the full three-dimensional\nequations of MHD and impose a termination radius at finite radial distance. We\nfocus here on studying the effects of relaxing the (ii) assumption of\naxisymmetry, i.e. of performing full 3D numerical simulations of a disc-wind\ncrossing all magnetohydrodynamic critical surfaces.

This theory is first\ncompared with the so-called extended electromagnetism (EE). These theories have\na notable resemblance and both explain the existence of a cosmological\nconstant. It is shown that, in EE, a positive dark energy density requires a\nLagrangian leading to quantum ghosts, whereas VT is free from these ghosts. On\naccount of this fact, the remainder of the paper is devoted to study cosmology\nin the framework of VT. Initial conditions, at high redshift, are used to solve\nthe evolution equations of all the VT scalar modes. In particular, a certain\nscalar mode characteristic of VT -which does not appear in general relativity\n(GR)- is chosen in such a way that it evolves separately. In other words, the\nscalar modes of the standard model based on GR do not affect the evolution of\nthe VT characteristic mode; however, this scalar mode influences the evolution\nof the standard GR ones. Some well known suitable codes (CMBFAST and COSMOMC)\nhave been modified to include our VT initial conditions and evolution\nequations, which are fully general. One of the resulting codes -based on\nstandard statistical methods- has been used to fit VT predictions and\nobservational evidences about both Ia supernovae and cosmic microwave\nbackground anisotropy. Seven free parameters are used in this fit.

In this paper we present a set of high\nresolution global magnetohydrodynamic disk simulations which are initialised\nwith different field configurations: purely toroidal, vertical field lines, and\nnested poloidal loops. A mass source term is included which allows the total\ndisk mass to equilibrate in simulations with long run times, and also enables\nthe impact of rapid mass injection to be explored. Notably different levels of\nangular momentum transport are observed during the early-time transient disk\nevolution.

Abstract: Giant planets like Jupiter and Saturn feature strong zonal wind patterns on\ntheir surfaces. Although several different mechanisms that may drive these jets\nhave been proposed over the last decades, the origin of the zonal winds is\nstill unclear. Here, we explore the possibility that the interplay of planetary\nrotation with the compression and expansion of the convecting fluid can drive\nmultiple deep zonal jets by a compressional Rhines-type mechanism, as\noriginally proposed by Ingersoll and Pollard (1982). In a certain limit, this\ndeep mechanism is shown to be mathematically analogous to the classical Rhines\nmechanism possibly operating at cloud level. Jets are predicted to occur on a\ncompressional Rhines length $l_R = (2 \\Omega \\langle H_\\rho^{-1} \\rangle\nv_{jet}^{-1} )^{-1/2}$, where $\\Omega$ is the angular velocity, $\\langle\nH_\\rho^{-1} \\rangle$ is the mean inverse density scale height and $v_{jet}$ is\nthe typical jet velocity. Two-dimensional numerical simulations using the\nanelastic approximation reveal that this mechanism robustly generates jets of\nthe predicted width, and that it typically dominates the dynamics in systems\ndeeper than $O(l_R)$. Potential vorticity staircases are observed to form\nspontaneously and are typically accompanied by unstably stratified buoyancy\nstaircases. The mechanism only operates at large rotation rates, exceeding\nthose typically reached in three-dimensional simulations of deep convection in\nspherical shells. Applied to Jupiter and Saturn, the compressional Rhines\nscaling reasonably fits the available observations. Interestingly, even weak\nvertical density variations such as those in the Earth core can give rise to a\nlarge number of jets, leading to fundamentally different flow structures than\npredicted by the Boussinesq models typically used in this context. \n\n"}

The dividing line between these\ntwo populations in central entropy, and therefore central cooling time, is\namazingly sharp.

Here we investigate how the spin\nof the black hole remnant influences mass ejection on the thermal and viscous\ntimescales. We carry out two-dimensional, time-dependent hydrodynamic\nsimulations of merger remnant accretion disks including viscous angular\nmomentum transport and approximate neutrino self-irradiation. The gravity of\nthe spinning black hole is included via a pseudo-Newtonian potential. We find\nthat a disk around a spinning black hole ejects more mass, up to a factor of\nseveral, relative to the non-spinning case. The enhanced mass loss is due to\nenergy release by accretion occurring deeper in the gravitational potential,\nraising the disk temperature and hence the rate of viscous heating in regions\nwhere neutrino cooling is ineffective. The mean electron fraction of the\noutflow increases moderately with BH spin due to a highly-irradiated (though\nnot neutrino-driven) wind component.

We show that highly-eccentric giant planets that will\nbecome hot Jupiters clear out any low-mass inner planets in the system,\nexplaining the observed lack of such companions to hot Jupiters. A less common\noutcome of the interaction is that the giant planet is ejected by the inner\nplanets.

In the past several years, 3D numerical\nsimulations made it possible to compute pulsar spindown luminosity from first\nprinciples and revealed that oblique pulsar winds are more powerful than\naligned ones. However, what causes this enhanced power output of oblique\npulsars is not understood. In this work, using time-dependent 3D\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) and force-free simulations, we show that, contrary to\nthe standard paradigm, the open magnetic flux, which carries the energy away\nfrom the pulsar, is laterally non-uniform. We argue that this non-uniformity is\nthe primary reason for the increased luminosity of oblique pulsars. To\ndemonstrate this, we construct simple analytic descriptions of aligned and\northogonal pulsar winds and combine them to obtain an accurate 3D description\nof the pulsar wind for any obliquity. Our approach describes both the warped\nmagnetospheric current sheet and the smooth variation of pulsar wind properties\noutside of it. We find that generically the magnetospheric current sheet\nseparates plasmas that move at mildly relativistic velocities relative to each\nother. This suggests that the magnetospheric reconnection is a type of driven,\nrather than free, reconnection. The jump in magnetic field components across\nthe current sheet decreases with increasing obliquity, which could be a\nmechanism that reduces dissipation in near-orthogonal pulsars. Our analytical\ndescription of the pulsar wind can be used for constructing models of pulsar\ngamma-ray emission, pulsar wind nebulae, and magnetar-powered core-collapse\ngamma-ray bursts and supernovae. \n\n"}

As changes in the pulse shape are often correlated with timing\nirregularities, precession is a possible cause of these phenomena. Whereas\npulsar magnetospheres are filled with plasma, most pulsar precession studies\nwere carried out within the vacuum approximation and neglected the effects of\nmagnetospheric currents and charges.

We discuss two scenarios for intermediate\nmass black hole formation. The SLOW and FAST scenarios. They occur later or\nearlier in the cluster evolution and require smaller or extremely large central\ndensities, respectively. In our simulations, the formation of intermediate mass\nblack holes is highly stochastic. In general, higher formation probabilities\nfollow from larger cluster concentrations (i.e. central densities). We further\ndiscuss possible observational signatures of the presence of intermediate mass\nblack holes in globular clusters that follow from our simulations. These\ninclude the spatial and kinematic structure of the host cluster, possible\nradio, X-ray and gravitational wave emissions due to dynamical collisions or\nmass-transfer and the creation of hypervelocity main sequence escapers during\nstrong dynamical interactions between binaries and an intermediate mass black\nhole. All simulations discussed in this paper were performed with the MOCCA\nMonte Carlo code. MOCCA accurately follows most of the important physical\nprocesses that occur during the dynamical evolution of star clusters but, as\nwith other dynamical codes, it approximates the dissipative processes connected\nwith stellar collisions and binary mergers. \n\n"}

We refine previous models of this process by modelling the star's magnetic\nfield self-consistently as a 'twisted torus' configuration in non-barotropic\nequilibrium (which allows us to explore a greater range of equilibrium\nconfigurations). It is shown that, if the star's magnetic field is purely\ndipolar, the change in the toroidal field strength required to produce an\nanti-glitch of the observed size can be ~ 10 times larger than previously\ncalculated. If the star has a quadrupolar magnetic field component, then an\nanti-glitch of similar magnitude can be produced via a decay of the quadrupole\ncomponent, in addition to a decay of the toroidal component.

Pure thermal feedback alone is sufficient to produce the observed\nsurface brightness, although it is very sensitive to the supernova rate.

As it is well known, a pure magnetic dipole brake\nyields $n = 3$, whereas a pure gravitational wave brake yields $n = 5$.\nTherefore, each of these mechanisms alone can not account for the braking index\nfound for PSR J1640-4631.

We suggest that advanced civilizations could cloak their\npresence, or deliberately broadcast it, through controlled laser emission. Such\nemission could distort the apparent shape of their transit light curves with\nrelatively little energy, due to the collimated beam and relatively infrequent\nnature of transits. We estimate that humanity could cloak the Earth from\nKepler-like broadband surveys using an optical monochromatic laser array\nemitting a peak power of about 30 MW for roughly 10 hours per year. A chromatic\ncloak, effective at all wavelengths, is more challenging requiring a large\narray of tunable lasers with a total power of approximately 250 MW.\nAlternatively, a civilization could cloak only the atmospheric signatures\nassociated with biological activity on their world, such as oxygen, which is\nachievable with a peak laser power of just around 160 kW per transit. Finally,\nwe suggest that the time of transit for optical SETI is analogous to the\nwater-hole in radio SETI, providing a clear window in which observers may\nexpect to communicate.

We\nanalyze in detail the cosmological models obtained by assuming that the quantum\ncorrection tensor is given by the coupling of a scalar field and of a scalar\nfunction to the metric tensor, and by a term proportional to the matter\nenergy-momentum tensor. For each considered model we obtain the gravitational\nfield equations, and the generalized Friedmann equations for the case of a flat\nhomogeneous and isotropic geometry. In some of these models the divergence of\nthe matter energy-momentum tensor is non-zero, indicating a process of matter\ncreation, which corresponds to an irreversible energy flow from the\ngravitational field to the matter fluid, and which is direct consequence of the\nnonminimal curvature-matter coupling. The cosmological evolution equations of\nthese modified gravity models induced by the quantum fluctuations of the metric\nare investigated in detail by using both analytical and numerical methods, and\nit is shown that a large variety of cosmological models can be constructed,\nwhich, depending on the numerical values of the model parameters, can exhibit\nboth accelerating and decelerating behaviors. \n\n"}

In addition to cataclysmic events involving black holes, GWs can\nbe triggered by physical processes and systems involving neutron stars.\nProperties of neutron stars are largely determined by the equation of state\n(EOS) of neutron-rich matter, which is the major ingredient in calculating the\nstellar structure and properties of related phenomena, such as gravitational\nwave emission from elliptically deformed pulsars and neutron star binaries.\nAlthough the EOS of neutron-rich matter is still rather uncertain mainly due to\nthe poorly known density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy at high\ndensities, significant progress has been made recently in constraining the\nsymmetry energy using data from terrestrial nuclear laboratories. These\nconstraints could provide useful information on the limits of GWs expected from\nneutron stars. Here after briefly reviewing our previous work on constraining\ngravitational radiation from elliptically deformed pulsars with terrestrial\nnuclear laboratory data in light of the recent gravitational wave detection, we\nestimate the maximum gravitational wave strain amplitude, using an optimistic\nvalue for the breaking strain of the neutron star crust, for 15 pulsars at\ndistances 0.16 kpc to 0.91 kpc from Earth, and find it to be in the range of\n$\\sim[0.2-31.1]\\times 10^{-24}$, depending on the details of the EOS used to\ncompute the neutron star properties.

From a\ntheoretical point of view, supersonic turbulence has been the subject of\ninterest in many analytical theories proposing a strong correlation with the\ncharacteristic mass of the core mass function (CMF) in star forming regions,\nand as a consequence with the stellar IMF. Performing two suites of smoothed\nparticles hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations with different mass resolutions, we\naim at testing the effects of variations in the turbulent properties of a\ndense, star forming molecular cloud on the shape of the system mass function in\ndifferent density regimes. While analytical theories predict a shift of the\npeak of the CMF towards lower masses with increasing velocity dispersion of the\ncloud, we observe in the low-density regime the opposite trend, with high Mach\nnumbers giving rise to a top-heavy mass distribution. For the high-density\nregime we do not find any trend correlating the Mach number with the\ncharacteristic mass of the resulting IMF, implying that the dynamics of\nprotostellar accretion discs and fragmentation on small scales is not strongly\naffected by turbulence driven at the scale of the cloud.

Abstract: Based on perturbation theory, we present the exact first-order solution to\nthe Einstein equations for the exterior static gravitational field of an\nisolated non-rotating star in a spatially finite universe having the topology\nof a flat 3-torus. Since the method of images leads to a divergent Poincare'\nseries, one needs a regularization which we achieve by using the Appell\nrespectively the Epstein zeta function. The solution depends on a new positive\nconstant which is completely fixed by the mass of the star and the spatial\nvolume of the universe. The physical interpretation is that a stable or\nmetastable equilibrium requires a topological dark energy which fills the whole\nuniverse with positive energy density and negative pressure.

Employing hydrodynamic\nsimulations in full general relativity, we find that the one-arm instability is\ngeneric in that it can develop in HMNSs within a few tens of milliseconds after\nmerger for all equations of state in our survey. We find that mergers with\nstiffer equations of state tend to produce HMNSs with stronger $m=2$ azimuthal\nmode density deformations, and weaker $m=1$ components, relative to softer\nequations of state. We also find that for equations of state that can give rise\nto double-core HMNSs, large $m=1$ density modes can already be present due to\nasymmetries in the two cores. This results in the generation of $l=2$, $m=1$\ngravitational wave modes even before the dominance of a one-arm mode that\nultimately arises following merger of the two cores. Our results further\nsuggest that stiffer equations of state give rise to HMNSs generating lower\n$m=1$ gravitational wave frequencies.

We study the environmental dependence of gas\naccretion onto galaxies using the cosmological, hydrodynamical EAGLE\nsimulation.

We find a strong suppression, by many orders of\nmagnitude, of the gas accretion rate in dense environments, primarily for\nsatellite galaxies. This suppression becomes stronger at lower redshift.\nHowever, the scatter in accretion rates is very large for satellites. This is\n(at least in part) due to the variation in halocentric radius, since gas\naccretion is more suppressed at smaller radii. Central galaxies are influenced\nless strongly by their environment and exhibit less scatter in their gas\naccretion rates. The star formation rates of both centrals and satellites show\nsimilar behaviour to their gas accretion rates. The relatively small\ndifferences between gas accretion and star formation rates demonstrate that\ngalaxies generally exhaust their gas reservoir somewhat faster at higher\nstellar mass, lower redshift, and in denser environments.

At closer distance towards galactic center the strength of attractive\nscalar fifth force becomes much stronger than gravity and is balanced by the\nFermi pressure of dark matter cloud, thus an equilibrium static configuration\nof dark matter halo is obtained. Like the case of soliton star or fermion\nQ-star, the stability of the dark matter halo is obtained as the scalar\nachieves a static profile and reaches an asymptotic value away from the\ngalactic center. For simple scalar-dark matter interaction and quadratic scalar\nself interaction potential, we show that dark matter behaves exactly like cold\ndark matter (CDM) beyond few $\\rm{kpc}$ away from galactic center but at closer\ndistance it becomes lighter and fermi pressure cannot be ignored anymore.

Finding an isolated low mass wide binary\nsystem in the earliest stage of formation, before tidal evolution could occur,\nwould prove that turbulent fragmentation is a viable mechanism for (very) low\nmass wide binaries. Here we report high resolution ALMA observations of a known\nwide-separation protostellar binary, showing that each component has a\ncircumstellar disk. The system is too young to have evolved from a close binary\nand the disk axes are misaligned, providing strong support for the turbulent\nfragmentation model.

Precise knowledge of the modulations\nare required to coherently track the source's phase over long observations, for\nexample, in pulsar timing, or searches for continuous gravitational waves. The\nmodulations can be modelled as sky-location and time-dependent time delays that\nconvert arrival times at the observer to the inertial frame of the source,\nwhich can often be the Solar system barycentre. We study the use of reduced\norder modelling for speeding up the calculation of this time delay for any\nsky-location. We find that the time delay model can be decomposed into just\nfour basis vectors, and with these the delay for any sky-location can be\nreconstructed to sub-nanosecond accuracy. When compared to standard routines\nfor time delay calculation in gravitational wave searches, using the reduced\nbasis can lead to speed-ups of 30 times. We have also studied components of\ntime delays for sources in binary systems. Assuming eccentricities $< 0.25$ we\ncan reconstruct the delays to within 100s of nanoseconds, with best case\nspeed-ups of a factor of 10, or factors of two when interpolating the basis for\ndifferent orbital periods or time stamps. In long-duration phase-coherent\nsearches for sources with sky-position uncertainties, or binary parameter\nuncertainties, these speed-ups could allow enhancements in their scopes without\nlarge additional computational burdens. \n\n"}

We studied the temporal and spectral\nbehavior of the source, and its short- and long-term evolution. We constructed\na simple toy-model to gain insight into the complex emission pattern of SMC\nX-3.

We find that the pulsed\nemission is dominated by hard photons, while at energies below ~1 keV, the\nemission is virtually non-pulsating. We further find that the shape of the\npulse profile and the short and long-term evolution of the source light-curve\ncan be explained by invoking a combination of a \"fan\" and a \"polar\" beam. Our\nspectroscopic analysis, reveals a two-component emission: a hard power law and\na soft thermal component.

GIBS revealed the presence of a velocity dispersion peak in\nthe central few degrees of the Galaxy by consistently measuring high velocity\ndispersion in three central most fields. Due to suboptimal distribution of\nthese fields, all being at negative latitudes and close to each other, the\nshape and extension of the sigma peak is poorly constrained.

Individual stellar spectra were extracted\nfor a number of stars comprised between ~500 and ~1200, depending on the seeing\nand the exposure time.

For this model the present day cosmic\nacceleration is not attributed to a negative pressure (dark energy) but it is\ndriven by a nontrivial energy flow leading to a negative spatial curvature. In\nthis paper we generalize the NRCM in two different ways to the relativistic\nregime and present analytical solutions of the corresponding Einstein\nequations. These relativistic models are characterized by two inequivalent\nextensions of the FLWR metric with a time-dependent curvature function $K (t)$\nand an expansion scalar $a(t)$. The fluid flow is supposed to be geodesic. The\nmodel V1 is shear-free with isotropic pressure and therefore conformal flat. In\ncontrast to V1 the second model V2 shows a nontrivial shear and an anisotropic\npressure. For both models the inhomogeneous solutions of the corresponding\nEinstein equations will agree in leading order at small distances with the NRCM\nif a(t) and K(t) are each identical with those determined in the NCRM. Then the\nmetric is completely fixed by three constants. The arising energy momentum\ntensor contains a nontrivial energy flow vector. Our models violate locally the\nweak energy condition.

We combine observations and\nchemical models to constrain the sulfur abundances and their sensitivity to\nphysical and chemical conditions in the DM Tau protoplanetary disk. Methods. We\nobtained $0.5^{\"}$ ALMA observations of DM Tau in Bands 4 and 6 in lines of CS,\nSO, SO$_2$, OCS, CCS, H$_2$CS and H$_2$S, achieving a $\\sim 5$ mJy sensitivity.\nUsing the non-LTE radiative transfer code RADEX and the forward-modeling tool\nDiskFit, disk-averaged CS column densities and upper limits for the other\nspecies were derived.

The lack of detections of a variety\nof sulfur-bearing molecules in DM Tau other than CS implies a dearth of\nreactive sulfur in the gas phase, either through efficient freeze-out or\nbecause most of the elemental sulfur is in other large species, as found in\ncomets.

We quantify how the thermal energy supplied by the\njet to the ejecta and the ability of a jet to escape the homologous ejecta\ndepend on the parameters of the jet engine and the ejecta. For collimated jets\ninitiated at early times compared to the engine duration, we show that\nsuccessful breakout of the forward cocoon shock necessitates a jet that\nsuccessfully escapes the ejecta. This is because the ejecta is expanding and\nabsorbing thermal energy, so that the forward shock from a failed jet stalls\nbefore it reaches the edge of the ejecta. This conclusion can be circumvented\nonly for very energetic wide angle jets, with parameters that are uncomfortable\ngiven short-duration GRB observations. For successful jets, we find two regimes\nof jet breakout from the ejecta, early breakout on timescales shorter than the\nengine duration, and late breakout well after the engine shuts off. A late\nbreakout can explain the observed delay between gravitational waves and gamma\nrays in GW 170817. We show that for the entire parameter space of jet\nparameters surveyed here (covering energies $\\sim 10^{48}-10^{51}$ ergs and\nopening angles $\\theta_j \\sim 0.07-0.4$) the thermal energy deposited into the\nejecta by the jet propagation is less than that produced by r-process heating\non second timescales by a factor of $\\gtrsim 10$.

For typical short\nGRB jet parameters, our conclusion is stronger: there is little thermal energy\nin the cocoon, much less than what is needed to explain the early blue\ncomponent of the kilonova in GW 170817. \n\n"}

During the first part of the outburst (MJD\n58004-58012), the source shows an optical-NIR spectrum that is consistent with\nan optically thin synchrotron power-law from a jet. After MJD 58015, however,\nthe source faded considerably, the drop in flux being much more evident at\nlower frequencies. Before the fading, we measure a de-reddened flux density of\n$\\gtrsim$100 mJy in the mid-infrared, making MAXI J1535-571 one of the\nbrightest mid-infrared BHBs known so far. A significant softening of the X-ray\nspectrum is evident contemporaneous with the infrared fade.

In the canonical model $n = 3$ for all pulsars,\nbut observational data show that $n \\neq 3$, indicating a limitation of the\nmodel. In this work we present a new approach to study the frequency decay of\nthe rotation of a pulsar, based on an adaptation of the canonical one. We\nconsider the pulsar a star that rotates in vacuum and has a strong magnetic\nfield but, differently from the canonical model, we assume that its moment of\ninertia changes in time due to a uniform variation of a displacement parameter\nin time. We found that the braking index results smaller than the canonical\nvalue as a consequence of an increase in the star's displacement parameter,\nwhose variation is small enough to allow plausible physical considerations that\ncan be applied to a more complex model for pulsars in the future. In\nparticular, this variation is of the order of neutron vortices' creep in\nrotating superfluids. When applied to pulsar data our model yielded values for\nthe stars' braking indices close to the observational ones. The application of\nthis approach to a more complex star model, where pulsars are assumed to have\nsuperfluid interiors, is the next step in probing it.

The UV-optical and X-ray\nlight curves include dips and flares, while several superluminal knots appear\nin the parsec-scale jet. The recovery time of the second dip was longer at\nUV-optical wavelengths, in conflict with a model in which the inner accretion\ndisk (AD) is disrupted during a dip and then refilled from outer to inner\nradii. We favor an alternative scenario in which occasional polar alignments of\nthe magnetic field in the disk and corona cause the flux dips and formation of\nshocks in the jet. Similar to observations of Seyfert galaxies, intra-band time\nlags of flux variations are longer than predicted by the standard AD model.\nThis suggests that scattering or some other reprocessing occurs.

A\nlarge span of migration rates were explored for Titan and Iapetus was started\non its local Laplace plane with a circular orbit. The resonance crossing can\ntrigger a chaotic evolution of the eccentricity and the inclination of Iapetus.\nThe outcome of the resonance is highly dependent on the migration rate. For a\nquality factor Q of over around 2000, the chaotic evolution of Iapetus in the\nresonance leads in most cases to its ejection, while simulations with a quality\nfactor between 100 and 2000 show a departure from the resonance with\npost-resonant eccentricities spanning from 0 up to 15%, and free inclinations\ncapable of reaching 11 degrees.

I focus on the evolution of the apparent spin frequency, which is\ntypically associated with the motion of a specific point on the stellar surface\n(e.g., polar cap). I start from long-term evolution (on the timescale when\ninstability significantly changes the spin frequency). For this case, I reduce\nevolution equations to one differential equation and demonstrate that it can be\ndirectly derived from energy conservation law. This equation governs evolution\nrate through sequence of thermally equilibrium states and provides linear\ncoupling for the cooling power and rotation energy losses via gravitational\nwave emission. In particular, it shows that differential rotation do not affect\nlong-term spin-down. On the contrary, on the short timescales, differential\nrotation can significantly modify the apparent spin-down, if one examines a\nstrongly unstable star with very small initial amplitude of unstable mode. This\nstatement is confirmed by consideration of Newtonian non-magnetized perfect\nfluid and dissipative stellar models as well as magnetized stellar model. For\nexample, despite that widely applied evolution equations predict effective spin\nto be constant in absence of dissipation, the CFS-unstable star should be\nobserved as spinning-down. However, effects of differential rotation on\napparent spin-down are negligible for realistic models of neutron star\nrecycling, unless: (1) the neutron star is not magnetized, and (2) r-mode\namplitude is modulated faster than the shear viscosity dissipation timescale,\nbeing large enough that spin-down can be measured on modulation timescale. \n\n"}

It is\nfrequently assumed that the primary lens mass dominates the lensing, with the\ncontribution of secondary masses along the line of sight being neglected.\nSecondary mass structures may, however, affect both the detectability of strong\nlensing in a given survey and modify the properties of the lensing that is\ndetected.

In particular, key\nelectron-capture rates, such as that for Co60 are much smaller. We consider\nhere the effects of these revised rates on the presupernova (post-oxygen\nburning) evolution of massive stars in the mass range 11 to 40 M_sun. Moreover,\nwe include, for the first time in models by our group, the effects of modern\nrates for beta-decay in addition to electron capture and positron emission.\nValues for the central electron mole number at the time of iron core collapse\nin the new models are typically larger, by delta Y_e = 0.005 to 0.015, than\nthose of Woosley & Weaver 1995, with a tendency for the more massive models to\ndisplay larger differences. About half of this change is a consequence of\nincluding beta-decay; the other half, result of the smaller rates for electron\ncapture. Unlike what might be expected solely on basis of the larger Y_e's, the\nnew iron core masses are systematically smaller owing to a decrease in the\nentropy in the outer iron core. The changes in iron core mass range from zero\nto 0.1 M_sun. We also observe, as predicted by Aufderheide et al.

The lighter star should survive for awhile, until tidal mass\nloss propels it toward the minimum stable mass of a (proto)-neutron star,\nwhereupon it explodes.

We use an objective algorithm to detect galaxy\ngroups. A 3sigma anti-correlation is observed between QSOs and galaxy groups.\nThis paucity of faint QSOs around groups is neither a selection effect nor due\nto restrictions on the placement of 2dF fibres. By observing the colours of\nQSOs on the scales of the anti-correlation, we limit dust in galaxy groups,\nfinding a maximum reddening of E(b_j-r) < 0.012 at the 95% level. The small\namount of dust thus inferred is insufficient to cause the anti-correlation,\nsupporting the suggestion by Croom & Shanks that the signal is due to\ngravitational lensing. The possibility remains that tailored dust models, such\nas grey dust, heavy patches of dust or a combination of dust and lensing, could\nexplain the anti-correlation. Assuming the signal is caused by lensing rather\nthan dust, we measure the average velocity dispersion of a Singular Isothermal\nSphere that would cause the anti-correlation as around 1150 km/s.

For standard CDM type\nmodels this means that the``turn-over'' at small k of the original PS\ndisappears in the PS of the biased field for the physically relevant range of\nthe threshold parameter.

We solve the\nradial momentum equation for solutions corresponding to an accretion flow that\nstarts from a subsonic state at infinity, smoothly passes the fast critical\npoint, then supersonically falls into the horizon of the black hole. The\nsolutions always have the following features: 1) The specific energy of fluid\nparticles remains constant but the specific angular momentum is effectively\nremoved by the magnetic field. 2) At large radii, where the disk motion is\ndominantly rotational, the energy density of the magnetic field is\nequipartitioned with the rotational energy density of the disk. 3) Inside the\nfast critical point, where radial motion becomes important, the ratio of the\nelectromagnetic energy density to the kinetic energy density drops quickly. The\nresults indicate that: 1) Disk accretion does not necessarily imply energy\ndissipation since magnetic fields do not have to transport or dissipate a lot\nof energy as they effectively transport angular momentum. 2) When resistivity\nis small, the large-scale magnetic field is amplified by the shearing rotation\nof the disk until the magnetic energy density is equipartitioned with the\nrotational energy density, ending up with a geometrically thick disk.

Abstract: We study the possibility of a cool disk existing in the Galactic Center in\nthe framework of the disk-corona evaporation/condensation model. Assuming an\ninactive disk, a hot corona should form above the disk since there is a\ncontinuous supply of hot gas from stellar winds of the close-by massive stars.\nWhether the cool disk can survive depends on the mass exchange between the disk\nand corona. If the disk-corona interaction is dominated by evaporation and the\nrate is larger than the Bondi accretion rate in the Galactic Center, the disk\nwill be depleted within a certain time period and no persistent disk will\nexist. On the other hand, if the interaction results in hot gas steadily\ncondensing into the disk, an inactive cool disk might survive. For this case we\nfurther investigate the Bremsstrahlung radiation from the hot corona and\ncompare it with the observed X-ray luminosity. Our model shows that, for\nstandard viscosity in the corona (alpha=0.3), the mass evaporation rate is much\nhigher than the Bondi accretion rate and the coronal density is much larger\nthan that inferred from Chandra observations. An inactive disk can not survive\nsuch strong evaporation. For small viscosity (alpha<0.07) we find condensation\nsolutions.

The\ngalaxy models are consistent with the LCDM paradigm of structure formation and\nthe simulations include the effects of radiative cooling and star formation. We\nfind that equal-mass mergers always lead to the formation of a close SMBH pair\nat the center of the remnant with separations limited solely by the adopted\nforce resolution of ~ 100 pc. Instead, the final SMBH separation in\nunequal-mass mergers depends sensitively on how the central structure of the\nmerging galaxies is modified by dissipation. In the absence of dissipation, the\nsatellite galaxy can be entirely disrupted before the merger is completed\nleaving its SMBH wandering at a distance too far from the center of the remnant\nfor the formation of a close pair. In contrast, we show that gas cooling\nfacilitates the pairing process by increasing the resilience of the companion\ngalaxy to tidal disruption. Moreover, we demonstrate that merging disk galaxies\nconstructed to obey the M(BH)-sigma relation, move relative to it depending on\nwhether they undergo a dissipational or collisionless merger, regardless of the\nmass ratio of the merging systems. Collisionless simulations reveal that\nremnants tend to move away from the mean relation highlighting the role of\ngas-poor mergers as a possible source of scatter.\n  In dissipational mergers, the interplay between strong gas inflows associated\nwith the formation of massive nuclear disks and the consumption of gas by star\nformation provides the necessary fuel to the SMBHs and allows the merger\nremnants to satisfy the relation. \n\n"}

Most simulations of star forming clusters\nuse an isothermal equation of state (EOS).

The\nsuperhorizon part is determined by the curvature perturbations and scalar field\nfluctuations: both feature infrared enhancements as the inverse of a\ncombination of slow roll parameters which measure the departure from scale\ninvariance in each case.Fermions and gravitons do not exhibit infrared\ndivergences. The subhorizon part is completely specified by the trace anomaly\nof the fields with different spins and is solely determined by the space-time\ngeometry. The one-loop quantum corrections to the amplitude of curvature and\ntensor perturbations are obtained to leading order in slow-roll and in the\n(H/M_PL)^2 expansion. This study provides a complete assessment of the\nbackreaction problem up to one loop including bosonic and fermionic degrees of\nfreedom.

This hypothesis can be viewed as an\nextension of an earlier idea put forth by Merritt and Aguilar. Our findings\nsuggest that a phenomenon related to the radial orbit instability is present in\nsuch halos and is responsible for density profile shapes. This instability sets\na scalelength at which the velocity dispersion distribution changes rapidly\nfrom isotropic to radially anisotropic. This scalelength is reflected in the\ndensity distribution as the radius at which the density profile changes slope.\nWe have tested the idea that radially dependent velocity dispersion anisotropy\nleads to a break in density profile shape by manipulating the input of a\nsemi-analytic model to imitate the velocity structure imposed by the radial\norbit instability. Without such manipulation, halos formed are approximated by\nsingle power-law density profiles and isotropic velocity distributions. Halos\nformed with altered inputs display density distributions featuring scalelengths\nand anisotropy profiles similar to those seen in cosmological N-body\nsimulations. \n\n"}

The gas in the band\nmust be expanding outward and the sharp front to it is identified as a shock\nfront, yet we see no temperature jump across it; indeed there is more soft\nemission behind the shock than in front of it.

Instead, although the\nAlfven radius at intermediate latitudes quickly approaches R_L as sigma_o\nexceeds unity, r_Y remains significantly less than R_L. Because r_Y < R_L, our\ncalculated spindown rates thus exceed the classic ``vacuum dipole'' rate.

Abstract: We investigate the internal consistency of the halo dark matter model which\nhas been proposed by de Boer et al. to explain the excess of diffuse galactic\ngamma rays observed by the EGRET experiment. Any model based on dark matter\nannihilation into quark jets, such as the supersymmetric model proposed by de\nBoer et al., inevitably also predicts a primary flux of antiprotons from the\nsame jets. Since propagation of the antiprotons in the unconventional,\ndisk-dominated type of halo model used by de Boer et al. is strongly\nconstrained by the measured ratio of boron to carbon nuclei in cosmic rays, we\ninvestigate the viability of the model using the DarkSUSY package to compute\nthe gamma-ray and antiproton fluxes. We are able to show that their model is\nexcluded by a wide margin from the measured flux of antiprotons. We therefore\nfind that a model of the type suggested by Moskalenko et al., where the\nintensities of protons and electrons in the cosmic rays vary with galactic\nposition, is far more plausible to explain the gamma excess. \n\n"}

This remnant\ncontains the most energetic pulsar known (PSR J0537-6910), which is surrounded\nby a bright nonthermal nebula that likely represents a toroidal pulsar wind\nterminal shock observed edge-on. We confirm the non-thermal nature of the\ncomet-shaped X-ray emission feature and show that the spectral steepening of\nthis feature away from the pulsar is quantitatively consistent with synchrotron\ncooling of shocked pulsar wind particles flowing downstream at a bulk velocity\nclose to the speed of light. Around the cometary nebula we unambiguously detect\na thermal component, which accounts for about 1/3 of the total 0.5 - 10 keV\nflux from the remnant. This thermal component is distributed among various\nclumps of metal-enriched plasma embedded in the low surface brightness\nX-ray-emitting diffuse gas. The relative metal enrichment pattern suggests that\nthe mass of the supernova progenitor is >~ 20M_sun. A comparison of the X-ray\ndata with HST optical images suggests that the explosion site is close to a\ndense cloud, against which a reflection shock is launched. The interaction\nbetween this reflection shock and the nebula has likely produced both its\ncometary shape and the surrounding thermal emission enhancement. SNR N157B is\napparently expanding into the hot low-density interior of a surrounding\nsuperbubble formed by the young OB association LH99, as revealed by Spitzer\nmid-infrared images. This scenario naturally explains the exceptionally large\nsizes of both the thermal and nonthermal components as well as the lack of an\nouter shell of the SNR. These results provide a rare glimpse into the SNR\nstructure and evolution in a region of recent star-formation. \n\n"}

One possible interpretation of this is that the Balmer\nhotspot lies downstream of the He II hotspot in the outer accretion disc, with\nthe He I and Ca II hotspots at intermediate locations between the two. This\nsuggests that Balmer emission is suppressed until material has cooled somewhat\ndownstream of the impact site and is able to recombine.

We analyze the\npossible processes that cause the overmerging and assess the extent to which\nthis problem can be cured with current computer resources and codes. Using both\nanalytic estimates and high resolution numerical simulations, we argue that the\novermerging is mainly due to the lack of numerical resolution.

We show how a neutron star differentially rotating at\nmillisecond periods (DROMP) could be such an engine.

The sequence, which includes the\ncentral elliptical galaxy, has a slope in good agreement with the model\npredictions of Kodama et al (1998) for z~1.

The\ncentral region of the cluster is deconvolved using the technique of Magain,\nCourbin & Sohy (1998), revealing a thick central arc coincident with an\nextended radio source. All the observed lensing features are readily explained\nby differential magnification of a radio loud AGN by a shallow elliptical\npotential.

I consider the\nconjectures of the derived model for the solar neutrino fluxes in case of a\nsolar core allowed to vary in relation to the surface activity cycle. The\nobserved neutrino flux data suggest a solar core possibly varying in time. In\nthe dynamic solar model the quiet and runaway energy sources together may\nproduce quasi-constant flux in the SuperKamiokande because it is sensitive to\nneutral currents, axions and anti-neutrinos, too. I calculate the contributions\nof the runaway source to the individual neutrino detectors. The results of the\ndynamic solar core model suggest that since the HOMESTAKE detects mostly the\nhigh energy electron neutrinos, therefore the HOMESTAKE data may aniticorrelate\nwith the activity cycle. Activity correlated changes are expected to be present\nonly marginally in the GALLEX and GNO data. The gallium detectors are sensitive\nmostly to the pp neutrinos, and the changes of the pp neutrinos arising from\nthe SSM-like core is mostly compensated by the high-energy electron neutrinos\nproduced by the hot bubbles of the dynamic energy source. The results suggest\nthat the GALLEX data may show an anti-correlation, while the SuperKamiokande\ndata may show a correlation with the activity cycle. Predictions of the dynamic\nsolar model are presented for the SNO and Borexino experiments which can\ndistinguish between the effects of the MSW mechanism and the consequences of\nthe dynamic solar model. The results of the dynamic solar model are consistent\nwith the present heioseismic measurements and can be checked with future\nheioseismic measurements as well.\n  Keywords: solar neutrino problems - solar activity - thermonuclear runaways \n\n"}

Since they possess oscillating\nelectric fields in a magnetic field, they dissipate their energies in\nmagnetized conducting media such as white dwarfs or neutron stars. At the same\ntime the oscillating electric fields generate a monochromatic radiation with\nenergy equal to mass of the axion. We argue that the effect of the energy\ndissipation can be seen in the old white dwarfs. In particular, We show that\ncolliding with sufficiently cooled white dwarfs, plausible candidates of MACHO,\nthe axionic boson stars dissipate their energies in the dwarfs and heat up the\ndwarfs.

Although most of our discussion refers to arbitrary p-branes, when\nwe need to be specific we assume that they are D-branes of Type II or Type I\nstring theory. For realistic brane couplings, such as those arising in string\ntheory, the inter-brane potentials are too steep to inflate the universe for\nacceptably long times. However, for special regions of the parameter space of\nbrane-antibrane positions the brane motion is slow enough for there to be\nsufficient inflation.

The proton fraction is determined by the nuclear symmetry\nenergy whose density dependence may be constrained by measuring the neutron\nradius of a heavy nucleus, such as 208Pb. Such a measurement is necessary for a\nreliable extrapolation of the proton fraction to the higher densities present\nin the neutron star. A large neutron radius in 208Pb implies a stiff symmetry\nenergy that grows rapidly with density, thereby favoring a high proton fraction\nand allowing direct URCA cooling. Predictions for the neutron radius in 208Pb\nare correlated to the proton fraction in dense matter by using a variety of\nrelativistic effective field-theory models. Models that predict a neutron (Rn)\nminus proton (Rp) root-mean-square radius in 208Pb to be Rn-Rp<0.20 fm have\nproton fractions too small to allow the direct URCA cooling of 1.4 solar-mass\nneutron stars.
