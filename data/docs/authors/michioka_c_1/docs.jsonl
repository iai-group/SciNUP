An earlier theoretical prediction on\nthe basis of this model was that of a pseudogap in the electron DOS, setting in\nat some temperature T* and evolving into the superconducting gap upon\napproaching Tc. A natural logical pursuit of this early work was to show that,\nin order to have a superconducting state evolved out of a pseudogap state, the\ndiamagnetic bosonic pair fluctuations (characterizing the pseudogap phase) have\nto be propagating modes, which are phase correlated over finite distances above\nTc.

In our theoretical\nframework, we could interpret the experimental results of the completely\ndifferent superconducting transition temperatures obtained in two very similar\ncuprate superconductors (La{2-x}Ba{x}CuO{4} of 40K and\nSr{2-x}Ba{x}CuO{3+\\delta} of 98K). In addition, the physical reason why the\nsuperconductivity does not occur in noble metals (like gold, silver and copper)\nis discussed. Finally, we argue that the metallic hydrogen cannot exhibit\nsuperconductivity at room temperature, it even cannot be a superconductor at\nany low temperature. \n\n"}

For\nexample, spin waves are an emergent property for antiferromagnets, but for weak\ncorrelations the normal phase of a (Slater) antiferromagnet is metallic,\nwhereas it is insulating (Heisenberg) for strong correlations. As a function of\ninteraction strength, above the antiferromagnetic phase, the crossover between\na metal and a local moment paramagnetic insulator is described by the Mott\ntransition, whose mean-field theory down to T=0 is best formulated with\ndynamical mean-field theory. A similar situation occurs for superconductors:\ndespite similar emergent properties, there are many differences between both\nkinds of superconductors. Experimental evidence suggests that hole-doped\ncuprates are strongly correlated whereas the correlations are weaker in the\nelectron-doped case, especially near optimal doping.

The mechanism behind that resides in the\nstructural incompatibility of two stereo-chemical configurations Cu$^{\\rm\nII}$O$_4$ and Cu$^{\\rm III}$O$_4$ which compose the CuO$_2$ planes. It leads to\nspontaneously fluctuating Cu - O - Cu valence bonds which establish a local\nFeshbach resonance exchange coupling between bound and unbound electron pairs.\nThe coupling, being the only free parameter in this scenario, the hole doping\nof the parent state is monitored by varying the total number of unpaired and\npaired electrons, in chemical equilibrium with each other.

In this paper, we combine sign-problem-free Quantum Monte\nCarlo simulations and field-theoretical analytical calculations to unveil the\nmicroscopic mechanism responsible for the superconducting instability of a\ngeneral low-energy model, called spin-fermion model. In this approach,\nlow-energy electronic states interact with each other via the exchange of\nquantum critical magnetic fluctuations. We find that even in the regime of\nmoderately strong interactions, both the superconducting transition temperature\nand the pairing susceptibility are governed not by the properties of the entire\nFermi surface, but instead by the properties of small portions of the Fermi\nsurface called hot spots. Moreover, $T_{c}$ increases with increasing\ninteraction strength, until it starts to saturate at the crossover from\nhot-spots dominated to Fermi-surface dominated pairing. Our work provides not\nonly invaluable insights into the system parameters that most strongly affect\n$T_{c}$, but also important benchmarks to assess the origin of\nsuperconductivity in both microscopic models and actual materials. \n\n"}

The experimental corpus shows that the\npseudogap line is one of a family of four straight lines which stretches across\nthe phase diagram from low to high doping, and from $T_c$ up to $700$ K.

These interaction and disorder effects can be incorporated into a\nmean-field description by means of a self-energy appearing in the Green's\nfunction. We first examine the quasiparticle scattering interference spectra in\nthe superconducting state at optimal doping as temperature is increased.\nAssuming agreement with angle-resolved photoemission experiments which suggest\nthat the scattering rate depends on temperature, resulting in the filling of\nthe $d$-wave gap, we find that the peaks predicted by the octet model become\nprogressively smeared as temperature is increased. When the scattering rate is\nof the same order of magnitude as the superconducting gap, the spectral\nfunction shows Fermi-arc-like patterns, while the power spectrum of the local\ndensity of states shows the destruction of the octet-model peaks.

In contrast, in underdoped high-T_c superconductors (HTSCs), a pseudogap\nappears at a much higher temperature T^*, smoothly evolving into the\nsuperconducting gap at T_c. Phase coherence on the other hand is only\nestablished at T_c, signaled by the appearance of a sharp quasiparticle (QP)\npeak in the excitation spectrum. Another important difference between the two\ntypes of superconductors is in the ratio of 2\\Delta / T_c=R. In BCS theory,\nR~3.5, is constant. In the HTSCs this ratio varies widely, continuing to\nincrease in the underdoped region, where the gap increases while T_c decreases.\nHere we report that in HTSCs it is the ratio z_A\\Delta_m/T_c which is\napproximately constant, where \\Delta_m is the maximum value of the d-wave gap,\nand z_A is the weight of the coherent excitations in the spectral function.\nThis is highly unusual, since in nearly all phase transitions, T_c is\ndetermined by an energy scale alone.

In the superconducting state, low temperature transport measurements\nsuggest that one can describe nodal quasiparticles within the framework of a\nBCS d-wave model by including forward elastic scattering and spin-fluctuation\ninelastic scattering. Here, using this model, we calculate the temperature and\nfrequency dependence of the on-shell nodal quasiparticle scattering rate in the\nsuperconducting state which determines the momentum width of the ARPES momentum\ndistribution curves. For a zero-energy quasiparticle at the nodal momentum k_N,\nboth the elastic and inelastic scattering rate show a sudden decrease as the\ntemperature drops below Tc, reflecting the onset of the gap amplitude. At low\ntemperatures the scattering rate decreases as T^3 and approaches a zero\ntemperature value determined by the elastic impurity scattering. For T>T_c, we\nfind a quasilinear dependence on T. At low reduced temperatures, the elastic\nscattering rate for the nodal quasiparticles exhibits a quasilinear increase at\nlow energy which arises from elastic scattering processes. The inelastic\nspin-fluctuation scattering leads to a low energy omega^3 dependence which, for\nomega>~Delta_0, crosses over to a quasilinear behavior. \n\n"}

While this analysis\nrequires us to posit a form for the frequency-dependent quasiparticle\nconductivity, we clearly demonstrate that the extraction of the relaxation rate\nis quite insensitive to the assumed shape of the quasiparticle spectrum. The\nrobustness of the analysis is rooted in the oscillator-strength sum rule and\nthe fact that we simultaneously measure the real and imaginary parts of the\nconductivity. In both Bi2212 and Tl2201 we infer a linear temperature\ndependence of the transport relaxation rate 1/tau and a small but finite\nzero-temperature intercept.
