In ``Seiberg-Witten Theory and Random\nPartitions'', Nekrasov and Okounkov studied these integrals using the\nrepresentation theory of ``vertex operators'' and the infinite wedge\nrepresentation. Many of these operators arise naturally from correspondences on\nthe moduli spaces, such as Nakajima's Heisenberg operators, and Grojnowski's\nvertex operators.\n  In this paper, we build a new vertex operator out of the Chern class of a\nvector bundle on a pair of moduli spaces. This operator has the advantage that\nit connects to the partition function by definition. It also incorporates the\ncanonical class of the surface, whereas many other studies assume that the\nclass vanishes. When the moduli space is the Hilbert scheme, we present an\nexplicit expression in the Nakajima operators, and the resulting combinatorial\nidentities.\n  We then apply the vertex operator to the above integrals.

Our main results\nare uniform versions of the DeGeorge--Wallach Theorem, of a theorem of Delorme\nand various other limit multiplicity theorems.\n  A basic idea is to adapt the notion of Benjamini--Schramm convergence\n(BS-convergence), originally introduced for sequences of finite graphs of\nbounded degree, to sequences of Riemannian manifolds, and analyze the possible\nlimits. We show that BS-convergence of locally symmetric spaces implies\nconvergence, in an appropriate sense, of the associated normalized relative\nPlancherel measures.

A modern way to phrase it is: the smoothable rank is equal to\nthe border rank for most polynomials. This property is very useful for studying\nsecant varieties, especially, whenever the smoothable rank is equal to the\nborder rank for all points of the secant variety in question.

Following their work, it is known\nthat functions preserving positivity when applied entrywise to positive\nsemidefinite matrices of all dimensions are necessarily analytic with\nnonnegative Taylor coefficients. When the dimension is fixed, it has been shown\nby Vasudeva and Horn that such functions are automatically continuous and\nsufficiently differentiable.

In this paper, we begin this study by characterizing entrywise\nfunctions which preserve the cone of positive semidefinite real matrices of\nrank $1$ with entries in a general interval. Classifying such functions is\nintimately connected to the classical problem of solving Cauchy's functional\nequations, which have non-measurable solutions.

{"id": "1406.3408", "contents": "Title: Preserving positivity for matrices with sparsity constraints Abstract: Functions preserving Loewner positivity when applied entrywise to positive\nsemidefinite matrices have been widely studied in the literature. Following the\nwork of Schoenberg [Duke Math. J. 9], Rudin [Duke Math. J. 26], and others, it\nis well-known that functions preserving positivity for matrices of all\ndimensions are absolutely monotonic (i.e., analytic with nonnegative Taylor\ncoefficients). In this paper, we study functions preserving positivity when\napplied entrywise to sparse matrices, with zeros encoded by a graph $G$ or a\nfamily of graphs $G_n$. Our results generalize Schoenberg and Rudin's results\nto a modern setting, where functions are often applied entrywise to sparse\nmatrices in order to improve their properties (e.g. better conditioning). The\nonly such result known in the literature is for the complete graph $K_2$. We\nprovide the first such characterization result for a large family of\nnon-complete graphs. Specifically, we characterize functions preserving Loewner\npositivity on matrices with zeros according to a tree. These functions are\nmultiplicatively midpoint-convex and super-additive. Leveraging the underlying\nsparsity in matrices thus admits the use of functions which are not necessarily\nanalytic nor absolutely monotonic. We further show that analytic functions\npreserving positivity on matrices with zeros according to trees can contain\narbitrarily long sequences of negative coefficients, thus obviating the need\nfor absolute monotonicity in a very strong sense. This result leads to the\nquestion of exactly when absolute monotonicity is necessary when preserving\npositivity for an arbitrary class of graphs. We then provide a stronger\ncondition in terms of the numerical range of all symmetric matrices, such that\nfunctions satisfying this condition on matrices with zeros according to any\nfamily of graphs with unbounded degrees are necessarily absolutely monotonic. \n\n"}

For an elliptic curve represented as a ramified double\ncovering of CP^1, a meromorphic differential is constructed with the following\nproperty: the common projection of its two zeros on the base of the covering,\nregarded as a function of the only moving branch point of the covering, is a\nsolution of a Painleve VI equation. This differential provides an invariant\nformulation of a classical Okamoto transformation for the Painleve VI\nequations. A generalization of this differential to hyperelliptic curves is\nalso constructed. In this case, positions of zeros of the differential provide\npart of a solution of the multidimensional Garnier system.

As such, it may\nbe taken as an extension of the techniques given by Borwein's \"An efficient\nalgorithm for computing the Riemann zeta function\", to more general series. The\nalgorithm provides a rapid means of evaluating Li_s(z) for general values of\ncomplex s and the region of complex z values given by |z^2/(z-1)|<4.\n  Alternatively, the Hurwitz zeta can be very rapidly evaluated by means of an\nEuler-Maclaurin series. The polylogarithm and the Hurwitz zeta are related, in\nthat two evaluations of the one can be used to obtain a value of the other;\nthus, either algorithm can be used to evaluate either function. The\nEuler-Maclaurin series is a clear performance winner for the Hurwitz zeta,\nwhile the Borwein algorithm is superior for evaluating the polylogarithm in the\nkidney-shaped region. Both algorithms are superior to the simple Taylor's\nseries or direct summation.\n  The primary, concrete result of this paper is an algorithm allows the\nexploration of the Hurwitz zeta in the critical strip, where fast algorithms\nare otherwise unavailable.
