We examine in more detail a previously studied\nquantum state of the massless minimally coupled scalar field, which we call a\n``Helfer state''. This is a state in which the energy density can be made\narbitrarily negative over an arbitrarily large region of space, but only at one\ninstant in time. In the Helfer state, the negative energy density is\naccompanied by rapidly time-varying energy fluxes. It is the latter feature\nwhich allows the quantum inequalities, bounds which restrict the magnitude and\nduration of negative energy, to hold for this class of states. An observer who\ninitially passes through the negative energy region will quickly encounter\nfluxes of positive energy which subsequently enter the region. We examine in\ndetail the correlation between the energy density and flux in the Helfer state\nin terms of their expectation values. We then study the correlation function\nbetween energy density and flux in the Minkowski vacuum state, for a massless\nminimally coupled scalar field in both two and four dimensions. In this latter\nanalysis we examine correlation functions rather than expectation values.\nRemarkably, we see qualitatively similar behavior to that in the Helfer state.\nMore specifically, an initial negative energy vacuum fluctuation in some region\nof space is correlated with a subsequent flux fluctuation of positive energy\ninto the region. We speculate that the mechanism which ensures that the quantum\ninequalities hold in the Helfer state, as well as in other quantum states\nassociated with negative energy, is, at least in some sense, already\n``encoded'' in the fluctuations of the vacuum. \n\n"}

A relay network with N relays and a single\nsource-destination pair is called a partially-coherent relay channel (PCRC) if\nthe destination has perfect channel state information (CSI) of all the channels\nand the relays have only the phase information of the source-to-relay channels.\nIn this paper, first, a new set of necessary and sufficient conditions for a\nSTBC to be SSD for co-located multiple antenna communication is obtained. Then,\nthis is extended to a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for a\ndistributed STBC (DSTBC) to be SSD for a PCRC, by identifying the additional\nconditions. Using this, several SSD DSTBCs for PCRC are identified among the\nknown classes of STBCs.

In\nthis setting, standard CS techniques cannot be applied directly for several\nreasons. First, the usual signal-independent and/or bounded noise models do not\napply to Poisson noise, which is non-additive and signal-dependent. Second, the\nCS matrices typically considered are not feasible in real optical systems\nbecause they do not adhere to important constraints, such as nonnegativity and\nphoton flux preservation. Third, the typical $\\ell_2$--$\\ell_1$ minimization\nleads to overfitting in the high-intensity regions and oversmoothing in the\nlow-intensity areas. In this paper, we describe how a feasible positivity- and\nflux-preserving sensing matrix can be constructed, and then analyze the\nperformance of a CS reconstruction approach for Poisson data that minimizes an\nobjective function consisting of a negative Poisson log likelihood term and a\npenalty term which measures signal sparsity.

In our setting, the channel\nbetween the base station and each user is modeled by a two-state Markov chain\nand the scheduled user sends back an ARQ feedback signal that arrives at the\nscheduler with a random delay that is i.i.d across users and time. The\nscheduler indirectly estimates the channel via accumulated delayed-ARQ feedback\nand uses this information to make scheduling decisions.

Nodes with active tokens\nhave transmission permits; they generate messages at a constant rate and send\neach message to a randomly selected neighbor. By using different strategies to\ncontrol the transmission permits we can obtain tradeoffs between message and\ntime complexity. Gossip corresponds to the case when all nodes have permits all\nthe time. We study algorithms where permits are revoked after transmission and\nrestored upon reception. Examples of such algorithms include Simple-Random\nWalk(SRW), Coalescent-Random-Walk(CRW) and Controlled Flooding(CFLD) and their\nhybrid variants. SRW has a single node permit, which is passed on in the\nnetwork. CRW, initially initially has a permit for each node but these permits\nare revoked gradually. The final result for SRW and CRW resides at a single(or\nfew) random node(s) making a direct comparison with GOSSIP difficult.

All nodes in the network are assumed to be oblivious to their\nforward channel gains; however, they have perfect information about their\nbackward channel gains. The focus of this paper is on simple, efficient, and\npractical relaying schemes to increase the expected-rate at the destination.\nFor this purpose, various combinations of relaying protocols and the broadcast\napproach (multi-layer coding) are proposed. For the decode-forward (DF)\nrelaying, the maximum finite-layer expected-rate as well as two upper-bounds on\nthe continuous-layer expected-rate are obtained. The main feature of the\nproposed DF scheme is that the layers being decoded at both relays are added\ncoherently at the destination although each relay has no information about the\nnumber of layers being successfully decoded by the other relay. It is proved\nthat the optimal coding scheme is transmitting uncorrelated signals via the\nrelays. Next, the maximum expected-rate of ON/OFF based amplify-forward (AF)\nrelaying is analytically derived.

Here equivalences are\nconsidered under a relatively broad framework - finite-dimensional,\nnon-sequential data spaces with equivalences under group action, for which\nanalogues of two well-studied embedding theorems are derived: the Whitney\nembedding theorem and the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma. Only the canonical data\npoints need to be carefully embedded, each such point representing a set of\ndata points equivalent under group action. Two-step embeddings are considered.\nFirst, a group invariant is applied to account for equivalences, and then\nsecondly, a linear embedding takes it down to low-dimensions. Our results\nrequire hypotheses on discriminability of the applied invariant, such notions\nrelated to seperating invariants (Dufresne, 2008), and completeness in pattern\nrecognition (Kakarala, 1992).

First, we introduce \"Mixed Noisy Network Coding\" (MNNC) scheme\nwhich generalizes \"Noisy Network Coding\" (NNC) where relays are allowed to\ndecode-and-forward (DF) messages while all of them (without exception) transmit\nnoisy descriptions of their observations. These descriptions are exploited at\nthe destination and the DF relays aim to decode the transmitted messages while\ncreating full cooperation among the nodes. Moreover, the destination and the DF\nrelays can independently select the set of descriptions to be decoded or\ntreated as interference. This concept is further extended to multi-hopping\nscenarios, referred to as \"Layered MNNC\" (LMNNC), where DF relays are organized\ninto disjoint groups representing one hop in the network. For cooperative\nunicast additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) networks we show that -provided DF\nrelays are properly chosen- MNNC improves over all previously established\nconstant gaps to the cut-set bound. Secondly, we consider the composite\ncooperative unicast network where the channel parameters are randomly drawn\nbefore communication starts and remain fixed during the transmission. Each draw\nis assumed to be unknown at the source and fully known at the destination but\nonly partly known at the relays. We introduce through MNNC scheme the concept\nof \"Selective Coding Strategy\" (SCS) that enables relays to decide dynamically\nwhether, in addition to communicate noisy descriptions, is possible to decode\nand forward messages.

One particular challenge for\ninference under linear models is understanding the conditions on the dictionary\nunder which reliable inference is possible. This challenge has attracted\nrenewed attention in recent years since many modern inference problems deal\nwith the \"underdetermined\" setting, in which the number of observations is much\nsmaller than the number of columns in the dictionary. This paper makes several\ncontributions for this setting when the set of observations is given by a\nlinear combination of a small number of groups of columns of the dictionary,\ntermed the \"block-sparse\" case. First, it specifies conditions on the\ndictionary under which most block subdictionaries are well conditioned. This\nresult is fundamentally different from prior work on block-sparse inference\nbecause (i) it provides conditions that can be explicitly computed in\npolynomial time, (ii) the given conditions translate into near-optimal scaling\nof the number of columns of the block subdictionaries as a function of the\nnumber of observations for a large class of dictionaries, and (iii) it suggests\nthat the spectral norm and the quadratic-mean block coherence of the dictionary\n(rather than the worst-case coherences) fundamentally limit the scaling of\ndimensions of the well-conditioned block subdictionaries.

The research\nis explicitly carried out on arbitrarily varying quantum channels (AVQCs). We\ngive an explicit example that answers the recent question whether the\ntransmission of messages over AVQCs can benefit from distribution of randomness\nbetween the legitimate sender and receiver in the affirmative. The specific\nclass of channels introduced in that example is then extended to show that the\ndeterministic capacity does have discontinuity points, while that behaviour is,\nat the same time, not generic: We show that it is continuous around its\npositivity points. This is in stark contrast to the randomness-assisted\ncapacity, which is always continuous in the channel. Our results imply that the\ndeterministic message transmission capacity of an AVQC can be discontinuous\nonly in points where it is zero, while the randomness assisted capacity is\nnonzero. Apart from the zero-error capacities, this is the first result that\nshows a discontinuity of a capacity for a large class of quantum channels. The\ncontinuity of the respective capacity for memoryless quantum channels had,\namong others, been listed as an open problem on the problem page of the ITP\nHannover for about six years before it was proven to be continuous.

The combined\nattributes of cooperation and adaptation are necessary to enable networks of\ndetectors to continually learn from streaming data and to continually track\ndrifts in the state of nature when deciding in favor of one hypothesis or\nanother. The results in the paper establish a fundamental scaling law for the\nsteady-state probabilities of miss-detection and false-alarm in the slow\nadaptation regime, when the agents interact with each other according to\ndistributed strategies that employ small constant step-sizes. The latter are\ncritical to enable continuous adaptation and learning. The work establishes\nthree key results. First, it is shown that the output of the collaborative\nprocess at each agent has a steady-state distribution. Second, it is shown that\nthis distribution is asymptotically Gaussian in the slow adaptation regime of\nsmall step-sizes. And third, by carrying out a detailed large deviations\nanalysis, closed-form expressions are derived for the decaying rates of the\nfalse-alarm and miss-detection probabilities.

These results rely on interesting and deep results about quantum\ncomputation in order to obtain hardness results about the difficulty of\n(classically) evaluating the partition functions for certain fixed parameters.\n  The motivation for this paper is to study more comprehensively the complexity\nof (classically) approximating the Ising and Tutte partition functions with\ncomplex parameters. Partition functions are combinatorial in nature and\nquantifying their approximation complexity does not require a detailed\nunderstanding of quantum computation. Using combinatorial arguments, we give\nthe first full classification of the complexity of multiplicatively\napproximating the norm and additively approximating the argument of the Ising\npartition function for complex edge interactions (as well as of approximating\nthe partition function according to a natural complex metric).

However Shannon's theory of information does not provide\nformulae to fully determine these quantities. Several recent studies have begun\naddressing this. Some possible definitions for PID quantities have been\nproposed, and some analyses have been carried out on systems composed of\ndiscrete variables. Here we present the first in-depth analysis of PIDs on\nGaussian systems, both static and dynamical. We show that, for a broad class of\nGaussian systems, previously proposed PID formulae imply that: (i) redundancy\nreduces to the minimum information provided by either source variable, and\nhence is independent of correlation between sources; (ii) synergy is the extra\ninformation contributed by the weaker source when the stronger source is known,\nand can either increase or decrease with correlation between sources.

Until recently it was believed that in multi-cellular massive MIMO\nsystem, even in the asymptotic regime, as the number of service antennas tends\nto infinity, the performance is limited by directed inter-cellular\ninterference.

When the modulation\ninterval is short compared to the bath memory time, the system-bath\ncorrelations are affected, thereby causing cooling or heating of the TLS,\ndepending on the interval. In steady state, a periodically-modulated TLS\ncoupled to two distinct baths constitutes the simplest quantum heat machine\n(QHM) that may operate as either an engine or a refrigerator, depending on the\nmodulation rate. We find their efficiency and power-output bounds and the\nconditions for attaining these bounds.

To address this, in this work we propose to\nuse structured random compression, that is, random projections that exploit the\ndata structure, for two NMF variants: classical and separable. In separable NMF\n(SNMF) the left factors are a subset of the columns of the input matrix. We\npresent suitable formulations for each problem, dealing with different\nrepresentative algorithms within each one. We show that the resulting\ncompressed techniques are faster than their uncompressed variants, vastly\nreduce memory demands, and do not encompass any significant deterioration in\nperformance. The proposed structured random projections for SNMF allow to deal\nwith arbitrarily shaped large matrices, beyond the standard limit of\ntall-and-skinny matrices, granting access to very efficient computations in\nthis general setting. We accompany the algorithmic presentation with\ntheoretical foundations and numerous and diverse examples, showing the\nsuitability of the proposed approaches. \n\n"}

The study proves the\nvulnerability of the uplink to the downlink interference and shows that the\nimproved FD rate gains harvested in the downlink (up to $97\\%$) comes at the\nexpense of a significant degradation in the uplink rate (up to $94\\%$).\nTherefore, we propose a novel fine-grained duplexing scheme, denoted as\n$\\alpha$-duplex scheme, which allows a partial overlap between the uplink and\nthe downlink frequency bands. We derive the required conditions to harvest rate\ngains from the $\\alpha$-duplex scheme and show its superiority to both the FD\nand half-duplex (HD) schemes. In particular, we show that the $\\alpha$-duplex\nscheme provides a simultaneous improvement of $28\\%$ for the downlink rate and\n$56\\%$ for the uplink rate. Finally, we show that the amount of the overlap can\nbe optimized based on the network design objective. \n\n"}

Thus, graph-filter design consists in\nchoosing the coefficients of these polynomials (known as filter coefficients)\nto resemble desired linear transformations.

This dimension reduction procedure succeeds when it preserves\ncertain geometric features of the set.\n  The question is how large the embedding dimension must be to ensure that\nrandomized dimension reduction succeeds with high probability.\n  This paper studies a natural family of randomized dimension reduction maps\nand a large class of data sets. It proves that there is a phase transition in\nthe success probability of the dimension reduction map as the embedding\ndimension increases. For a given data set, the location of the phase transition\nis the same for all maps in this family. Furthermore, each map has the same\nstability properties, as quantified through the restricted minimum singular\nvalue. These results can be viewed as new universality laws in high-dimensional\nstochastic geometry.\n  Universality laws for randomized dimension reduction have many applications\nin applied mathematics, signal processing, and statistics.

It is of paramount\nimportance that the required resources, such as energy and bandwidth, do not\nscale with traffic. While the aggregate network traffic is growing at an\nunprecedented rate, users tend to request the same popular contents at\ndifferent time instants. Therefore, caching the most popular contents at the\nnetwork edge is a promising solution to reduce the traffic and the energy\nconsumption over the backhaul links. In this paper, two scenarios are\nconsidered, where caching is performed either at a small base station, or\ndirectly at the user terminals, which communicate using \\ac{D2D}\ncommunications. In both scenarios, joint design of the transmission and caching\npolicies is studied when the user demands are known in advance. This joint\ndesign offers two different caching gains, namely, the \\textit{pre-downloading}\nand \\textit{local caching gains}. It is shown that the finite cache capacity\nlimits the attainable gains, and creates an inherent tradeoff between the two\ntypes of gains. In this context, a continuous time optimization problem is\nformulated to determine the optimal transmission and caching policies that\nminimize a generic cost function, such as energy, bandwidth, or throughput. The\njointly optimal solution is obtained by demonstrating that caching files at a\nconstant rate is optimal, which allows to reformulate the problem as a\nfinite-dimensional convex program.

We demonstrate\napproximate optimality with respect to information-theoretic bounds that do not\nimpose any restrictions on the caching and delivery strategies. Our\ncharacterization reveals three key insights. First, the approximate DoF is\nachieved using a strategy that separates the physical and network layers.

The mean entanglement\ngrows linearly in time, while fluctuations grow like $(\\text{time})^{1/3}$ and\nare spatially correlated over a distance $\\propto (\\text{time})^{2/3}$. We\nderive KPZ universal behaviour in three complementary ways, by mapping random\nentanglement growth to: (i) a stochastic model of a growing surface; (ii) a\n`minimal cut' picture, reminiscent of the Ryu--Takayanagi formula in\nholography; and (iii) a hydrodynamic problem involving the dynamical spreading\nof operators.

Baik, Ben\nArous and P\\'ech\\'e showed that the spiked Wishart ensemble exhibits a sharp\nphase transition asymptotically: when the signal strength is above a critical\nthreshold, it is possible to detect the presence of a spike based on the top\neigenvalue, and below the threshold the top eigenvalue provides no information.\nSuch results form the basis of our understanding of when PCA can detect a\nlow-rank signal in the presence of noise.\n  However, not all the information about the spike is necessarily contained in\nthe spectrum. We study the fundamental limitations of statistical methods,\nincluding non-spectral ones.

Unfortunately, NMT systems are\nknown to be computationally expensive both in training and in translation\ninference. Also, most NMT systems have difficulty with rare words.

Our model consists of a deep LSTM network with 8 encoder and 8 decoder\nlayers using attention and residual connections. To improve parallelism and\ntherefore decrease training time, our attention mechanism connects the bottom\nlayer of the decoder to the top layer of the encoder. To accelerate the final\ntranslation speed, we employ low-precision arithmetic during inference\ncomputations. To improve handling of rare words, we divide words into a limited\nset of common sub-word units (\"wordpieces\") for both input and output. This\nmethod provides a good balance between the flexibility of \"character\"-delimited\nmodels and the efficiency of \"word\"-delimited models, naturally handles\ntranslation of rare words, and ultimately improves the overall accuracy of the\nsystem.

On the other hand, the delay in the communication channel\ncauses information loss, as it makes the state information available at the\ncontroller out of date. Combining these two effects, we show a phase transition\nbehavior in the transmission rate required for stabilization using a given\nevent-triggering strategy. For small values of the delay, the timing\ninformation carried by the triggering events is substantial, and the system can\nbe stabilized with any positive rate. When the delay exceeds a critical\nthreshold, the timing information alone is not enough to achieve stabilization\nand the required rate grows.

The backhaul load is defined as the sum of all\nthe messages available at all the transmitters per channel use, normalized by\nthe number of users. For Wyner's linear interference network, where each\ntransmitter is connected to the receiver having the same index as well as one\nsucceeding receiver, the per user DoF is characterized and the optimal scheme\nis presented. Furthermore, it is shown that the optimal assignment of messages\nto transmitters is asymmetric and satisfies a local cooperation constraint, and\nthat the optimal coding scheme relies only on one-shot cooperative zero-forcing\ntransmit beamforming. Using insights from the analysis of Wyner's linear\ninterference network, the results are extended to the more practical hexagonal\nsectored cellular network, and coding schemes based on cooperative zero-forcing\nare shown to deliver significant DoF gains.

We devise the notion of a \"proof sequence\" of a specific class of\nShannon-type information inequalities called \"Shannon flow inequalities\". We\nthen show how such a proof sequence can be interpreted as symbolic instructions\nguiding an algorithm called \"PANDA\", which answers disjunctive datalog rules\nwithin the time that the size bound predicted.

Specifically,\nthe UAVs first charge the GTs by transmitting the wireless energy transfer\n(WET) signals in the downlink. Then, by utilizing the harvested wireless energy\nfrom the UAVs, the GTs send their uplink wireless information transmission\n(WIT) signals to the UAVs. In this paper, depending on the operations of the\nUAVs, we adopt two different scenarios, namely integrated UAV and separated UAV\nWPCNs. First, in the integrated UAV WPCN, a UAV acts as a hybrid AP in which\nboth energy transfer and information reception are processed at a single UAV.\nIn contrast, for the separated UAV WPCN, we consider two UAVs each of which\nbehaves as an energy AP and an information AP independently, and thus the\nenergy transfer and the information decoding are separately performed at two\ndifferent UAVs. For both systems, we jointly optimize the trajectories of the\nUAVs, the uplink power control, and the time resource allocation for the WET\nand the WIT to maximize the minimum throughput of the GTs.

These form a new family of second laws of thermodynamics, which are\nequivalent to the monotonicity of quantum R\\'enyi divergences. In black hole\nthermodynamics, the usual second law is manifest as the area increase theorem.\nHence one may ask if these additional laws imply new restrictions for\ngravitational dynamics, such as for out-of-equilibrium black holes?

Further, within this framework, we show that there exist transitions\nwhich are allowed by the traditional second law, but forbidden by the\nadditional thermodynamical constraints.

An\nimportant problem in this domain is to identify repeated sequences of states,\nknown as motifs. Such motifs correspond to complex behaviors that capture\ncommon sequences of state transitions.

The inferential capability of the adversary is, in turn, quantified by a\nclass of adversarial loss functions that we introduce as $\\alpha$-loss,\n$\\alpha\\in[1,\\infty]$. The choice of $\\alpha$ determines the specific\nadversarial action and ranges from refining a belief (about any function of the\ndata) for $\\alpha=1$ to guessing the most likely value for $\\alpha=\\infty$\nwhile refining the $\\alpha^{th}$ moment of the belief for $\\alpha$ in between.\nMaximal alpha-leakage then quantifies the adversarial gain under $\\alpha$-loss\nover all possible functions of the data. In particular, for the extremal values\nof $\\alpha=1$ and $\\alpha=\\infty$, maximal alpha-leakage simplifies to mutual\ninformation and maximal leakage, respectively. For $\\alpha\\in(1,\\infty)$ this\nmeasure is shown to be the Arimoto channel capacity of order $\\alpha$. We show\nthat maximal alpha-leakage satisfies data processing inequalities and a\nsub-additivity property thereby allowing for a weak composition result.\nBuilding upon these properties, we use maximal alpha-leakage as the privacy\nmeasure and study the problem of data publishing with privacy guarantees,\nwherein the utility of the released data is ensured via a hard distortion\nconstraint. Unlike average distortion, hard distortion provides a deterministic\nguarantee of fidelity. We show that under a hard distortion constraint, for\n$\\alpha>1$ the optimal mechanism is independent of $\\alpha$, and therefore, the\nresulting optimal tradeoff is the same for all values of $\\alpha>1$. Finally,\nthe tunability of maximal alpha-leakage as a privacy measure is also\nillustrated for binary data with average Hamming distortion as the utility\nmeasure. \n\n"}

As a secondary\nuser (SU), a DSA device will face two critical problems: avoiding causing\nharmful interference to primary users (PUs), and conducting effective\ninterference coordination with other secondary users. These two problems become\neven more challenging for a distributed DSA network where there is no\ncentralized controllers for SUs. In this paper, we investigate communication\nstrategies of a distributive DSA network under the presence of spectrum sensing\nerrors. To be specific, we apply the powerful machine learning tool, deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL), for SUs to learn \"appropriate\" spectrum access\nstrategies in a distributed fashion assuming NO knowledge of the underlying\nsystem statistics. Furthermore, a special type of recurrent neural network\n(RNN), called the reservoir computing (RC), is utilized to realize DRL by\ntaking advantage of the underlying temporal correlation of the DSA network.\nUsing the introduced machine learning-based strategy, SUs could make spectrum\naccess decisions distributedly relying only on their own current and past\nspectrum sensing outcomes. Through extensive experiments, our results suggest\nthat the RC-based spectrum access strategy can help the SU to significantly\nreduce the chances of collision with PUs and other SUs.

However, when applied\nto systems which are not defined on one-dimensional lattices, a serious\ndrawback of the MPS is the exponential decay of the correlations, which limits\nits power in capturing long-range dependences among variables in the system. To\nalleviate this problem, we propose to introduce long-range interactions, which\nact as shortcuts, to MPS, resulting in a new model \\textit{ Shortcut Matrix\nProduct States} (SMPS).

As\nthe signal from a single electron spin is minute, different spin states are\nconverted to different charge states. Charge detection so far mostly relied on\nexternal electrometers, which hinders scaling to two-dimensional spin qubit\narrays. As an alternative, gate-based dispersive read-out based on off-chip\nlumped element resonators were introduced, but here integration times of 0.2 to\n2 ms were required to achieve single-shot read-out. Here we connect an on-chip\nsuperconducting resonant circuit to two of the gates that confine electrons in\na double quantum dot.

While being a central issue in the field, still\nlacking are notions of natural analysts that allow for more optimistic bounds\nfaithful to the reality that typical analysts aren't adversarial.\n  In this work, we propose notions of natural analysts that smoothly\ninterpolate between the optimal non-adaptive bounds and the best-known adaptive\ngeneralization bounds. To accomplish this, we model the analyst's knowledge as\nevolving according to the rules of an unknown dynamical system that takes in\nrevealed information and outputs new statistical queries to the data. This\nallows us to restrict the analyst through different natural control-theoretic\nnotions. One such notion corresponds to a recency bias, formalizing an\ninability to arbitrarily use distant information.
