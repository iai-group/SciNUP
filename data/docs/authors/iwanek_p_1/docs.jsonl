A vast array of\nscience will be enabled by a single wide-deep-fast sky survey, and LSST will\nhave unique survey capability in the faint time domain. The LSST design is\ndriven by four main science themes: probing dark energy and dark matter, taking\nan inventory of the Solar System, exploring the transient optical sky, and\nmapping the Milky Way. LSST will be a wide-field ground-based system sited at\nCerro Pach\\'{o}n in northern Chile. The telescope will have an 8.4 m (6.5 m\neffective) primary mirror, a 9.6 deg$^2$ field of view, and a 3.2 Gigapixel\ncamera. The standard observing sequence will consist of pairs of 15-second\nexposures in a given field, with two such visits in each pointing in a given\nnight. With these repeats, the LSST system is capable of imaging about 10,000\nsquare degrees of sky in a single filter in three nights. The typical 5$\\sigma$\npoint-source depth in a single visit in $r$ will be $\\sim 24.5$ (AB). The\nproject is in the construction phase and will begin regular survey operations\nby 2022. The survey area will be contained within 30,000 deg$^2$ with\n$\\delta<+34.5^\\circ$, and will be imaged multiple times in six bands, $ugrizy$,\ncovering the wavelength range 320--1050 nm. About 90\\% of the observing time\nwill be devoted to a deep-wide-fast survey mode which will uniformly observe a\n18,000 deg$^2$ region about 800 times (summed over all six bands) during the\nanticipated 10 years of operations, and yield a coadded map to $r\\sim27.5$. The\nremaining 10\\% of the observing time will be allocated to projects such as a\nVery Deep and Fast time domain survey. The goal is to make LSST data products,\nincluding a relational database of about 32 trillion observations of 40 billion\nobjects, available to the public and scientists around the world. \n\n"}

We also\nshow that any Bondi-Hoyle accretion of contaminated residual gas from the natal\nstar cluster made a negligible contribution to the primordial Al-26 inventory\nof the Solar System. These results are consistent with the absence of the\noxygen isotopic signature expected with any late introduction of supernova\nejecta into the protoplanetary disk. Instead, the presence of Al-26 in the\noldest Solar System solids (calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions or CAIs) and its\napparent uniform distribution with the inferred canonical Al-26/Al-27 ratio of\n(4.5-5)E-5 support the inheritance of Al-26 from the parent giant molecular\ncloud.

We calculated the Galactic\ndistribution of Al-26/Al-27 ratios that arise from such contamination using the\nestablished embedded cluster mass and stellar initial mass functions, published\nnucleosynthetic yields from the winds of massive stars, and by assuming rapid\nand uniform mixing into the cloud. Although our model predicts that the\nmajority of stellar systems contain no Al-26 from massive stars, and that the a\npriori probability that the Al-26/Al-27 ratio will reach or exceed the\ncanonical Solar System value is only ~6%, the maximum in the distribution of\nnon-zero values is close to the canonical ratio. \n\n"}

Different analysis methods have been proposed for this purpose, but so\nfar, no comparative test has been performed to test their validity. We\ncalculated model spectra of disk models with different geometries and central\nsources, using a 2D radiative transfer code. These spectra were then fitted in\na blind test using four different spectral decomposition methods. We studied\nthe effect of disk structure (flared vs. flat), inclination angle, size of the\ninner disk hole and stellar luminosity on the fitted chemical composition. Our\nresults show that the derived dust compositions by all methods deviate\nsystematically from the real chemical composition. Out of the four tested\nspectral decomposition methods, our new two-layer temperature distribution\nmethod, differs the least from the input dust composition and the results show\nthe weakest systematic effects. The reason for the deviations of the results\ngiven by other methods lies in their simplifying assumptions (e.g. single\naverage grain temperature or one component continuum). We also tested the\ninfluence of different noise levels on the results of the spectral\ndecomposition methods. We find that, for ground-based observations (8-13\nmicrometer) the expected uncertainty in the value of the crystallinity is about\n11% for a signal-to-noise ratio of 100, while for space-based observations\n(7-17 micrometer) the uncertainty is about 5%.

In general, psi cannot be measured, but for transiting planets\none can measure the angle lambda between the sky projections of the two axes\nvia the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect.

As\nplanets are thought to form in circumstellar disks, one important question in\nplanet formation is determining whether, and to what degree, a gaseous disk\naffects an eccentric planet's orbit. Recent studies have probed the interaction\nbetween a disk and a terrestrial planet on an eccentric orbit, and the\ninteraction between a disk and a gas giant on a nearly circular orbit, but\nlittle is known about the interaction between a disk and an eccentric gas\ngiant. Such a scenario could arise due to scattering while the disk is still\npresent, or perhaps through planet formation via gravitational instability. We\nfill this gap with simulations of eccentric, massive (gap-forming) planets in\ndisks using the hydrodynamical code FARGO. Although the long-term orbital\nevolution of the planet depends on disk properties, including the boundary\nconditions used, the disk always acts to damp eccentricity when the planet is\nreleased into the disk. This eccentricity damping takes place on a timescale of\n40 years, 15 times faster than the migration timescale. \n\n"}

It is possible that these two objects could\nbe lower mass planets (of mass ~5 and ~3 Jupiters) that have been scattered to\nwider orbits. We make the first direct comparison of newly reduced archival\nGemini adaptive optics images to archival HST/NICMOS images.

In a model where the\ntotal ionizing luminosity is divided equally between X-ray and EUV luminosity,\nwe find a photoevaporation rate of 1.4e-8 M_sun/yr, which is two orders of\nmagnitude greater than the case of EUV photoevaporation alone. Thus it is clear\nthat the X-rays are the dominant driving mechanism for photoevaporation. This\ncan be understood inasmuch as X-rays are capable of penetrating much larger\ncolumns (~1e22 cm^-2) and can thus effect heating in denser regions and at\nlarger radius than the EUV can. The radial extent of the launching region of\nthe X-ray heated wind is 1-70AU compared with the pure EUV case where the\nlaunch region is concentrated around a few AU. When we couple our wind\nmass-loss rates with models for the disc's viscous evolution, we find that, as\nin the pure EUV case, there is a photoevaporative switch, such that an inner\nhole develops at ~ 1 AU at the point that the accretion rate in the disc drops\nbelow the wind mass loss rate. At this point, the remaining disc material is\nquickly removed in the final 15-20% of the disc's lifetime. This is consistent\nwith the 1e5 yr transitional timescale estimated from observations of T-Tauri\nstars. We also caution that although our mass-loss rates are high compared to\nsome accretion rates observed in young stars, our model has a rather large\nX-ray luminosity of 2e30 erg/s; further modeling is required in order to\ninvestigate the evolutionary implications of the large observed spread of X-ray\nluminosities in T-Tauri stars. \n\n"}

The two-decade spread in accretion rates among T Tauri\nstars is too large to result solely from variety in the grain size and stellar\nX-ray luminosity, but can be produced by varying these together with the disk\nmagnetic flux. The diversity in the silicate bands can come from the coupling\nof grain settling to the distribution of the magneto-rotational turbulence,\nthrough three effects: (1) Recombination on grains yields a magnetically\ninactive dead zone extending above two scale heights, while turbulence in the\nmagnetically active disk atmosphere overshoots the dead zone boundary by only\nabout one scale height. (2) Grains deep in the dead zone oscillate vertically\nin waves driven by the turbulent layer above, but on average settle at the\nlaminar rates, so the interior of the dead zone is a particle sink and the disk\natmosphere becomes dust-depleted.

The\nsimulation results reveal a process of spontaneous formation of stable magnetic\nstructures, which may be a key to understanding of the magnetic\nself-organization on the Sun and formation of pores and sunspots. This process\nconsists of two basic steps: 1) formation of small-scale filamentary magnetic\nstructures associated with concentrations of vorticity and whirlpool-type\nmotions, and 2) merging of these structures due to the vortex attraction,\ncaused by converging downdrafts around magnetic concentration below the\nsurface.

Particularly, we include the effects of gravitational\ninstabilities (wakes) that importantly enhance the disk's viscosity. We show\nthat common estimates of the disk's spreading time-scales with constant\nviscosity significantly underestimate the rings' lifetime. With a realistic\nviscosity model, an initially narrow ring undergoes two successive evolutionary\nstages: (1) a transient rapid spreading when the disk is self-gravitating, with\nthe formation of a density peak inward and an outer region marginally\ngravitationally stable, and with an emptying time-scale proportional to 1/M_0^2\n(where M_0 is the disk's initial mass) (2) an asymptotic regime where the\nspreading rate continuously slows down as larger parts of the disk become\nnot-self-gravitating due to the decrease of the surface density, until the disk\nbecomes completely not-self-gravitating. At this point its evolution\ndramatically slows down, with an emptying time-scale proportional to 1/M_0,\nwhich significantly increases the disk's lifetime compared to the case with\nconstant viscosity. We show also that the disk's width scales like t^{1/4} with\nthe realistic viscosity model, while it scales like t^{1/2} in the case of\nconstant viscosity, resulting in much larger evolutionary time-scales in our\nmodel.

We employ a\ntheoretical framework for a well-controlled statistical study of\ntwo-dimensional simulations of thermonuclear supernovae with randomized initial\nconditions that can, with a particular choice of transition density, produce a\nsimilar average and range of Ni-56 masses to those inferred from observations.\nWithin this framework, we utilize a more realistic \"simmered\" white dwarf\nprogenitor model with a flame model and energetics scheme to calculate the\namount of Ni-56 and NSE material synthesized for a suite of simulated\nexplosions in which the transition density is varied in the range 1-3x10^7\ng/cc. We find a quadratic dependence of the NSE yield on the log of the\ntransition density, which is determined by the competition between plume rise\nand stellar expansion. By considering the effect of metallicity on the\ntransition density, we find the NSE yield decreases by 0.055 +/- 0.004 solar\nmasses for a 1 solar metallicity increase evaluated about solar metallicity.\nFor the same change in metallicity, this result translates to a 0.067 +/- 0.004\nsolar mass decrease in the Ni-56 yield, slightly stronger than that due to the\nvariation in electron fraction from the initial composition.

Following the collapse from\nthe prestellar phase allows us to model the early embedded phase of disk\nformation and evolution. During this time, the disk is susceptible to\nfragmentation, depending upon the properties of the initial prestellar core.\nGlobally, we find that higher initial core angular momentum and mass content\nfavors more fragmentation, but higher levels of background radiation can\nmoderate the tendency to fragment. A higher rate of mass infall onto the disk\nthan that onto the star is a necessary but not sufficient condition for disk\nfragmentation.

These calculations predict\nperiod gaps for planetary and brown dwarf companions to white dwarfs.

If the dynamo is in a diffusion-dominated regime,\nthen we find that most of the cycle amplitudes also get modeled up to some\nextent when we model the periods. Next, we propose that at the beginning of the\nMaunder minimum the amplitude of meridional circulation dropped to a low value\nand then after a few years it increased again. Several independent studies also\nfavor this assumption. With this assumption, a diffusion-dominated dynamo is\nable to reproduce many important features of the Maunder minimum remarkably\nwell. If the dynamo is in a diffusion-dominated regime, then a slower\nmeridional circulation means that the poloidal field gets more time to diffuse\nduring its transport through the convection zone, making the dynamo weaker.\nThis consequence helps to model both the cycle amplitudes and the Maunder-like\nminima. We, however, fail to reproduce these results if the dynamo is in an\nadvection-dominated regime. \n\n"}

However, there is a potential transition phase (which we\ncall the \"snowball phase\"), between the formation of the first planetesimals\nand the onset of mutual collisions amongst them, which has often been either\nignored or underestimated in previous studies. In this snowball phase, isolated\nplanetesimals move on Keplerian orbits and grow solely via the direct accretion\nof sub-cm sized dust entrained with the gas in the protoplanetary disk. Using a\nsimplified model in which planetesimals are progressively produced from the\ndust, we consider the expected sizes to which the planetesimals can grow before\nmutual collisions commence and derive the dependence of this size on a number\nof critical parameters, including the degree of disk turbulence, the\nplanetesimal size at birth and the rate of planetesimal creation.

Given the limited data\navailable, the inference of a thermal inversion depends critically on the\nchemical composition assumed for the atmosphere. In this study, we explore the\ndegeneracies between thermal inversions and molecular abundances in four highly\nirradiated hot Jupiter atmospheres, day-side observations of which were\npreviously reported to be consistent with thermal inversions based on Spitzer\nphotometry. The four systems are: HD 209458b, HAT-P-7b, TrES-4, and TrES-2. For\neach system, we explore the model parameter space with ~ 10^6 models using a\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo routine. Our results primarily suggest that a thorough\nexploration of the model parameter space is necessary to identify thermal\ninversions in hot Jupiter atmospheres. We find that existing observations of\nTrES-4 and TrES-2 can both be fit very precisely with models with and without\nthermal inversions, and with a wide range in chemical composition.

The variation in a planet's transit times may be used\nto infer the presence of additional planets. Deducing the masses and orbital\nparameters of such planets from transit time variations (TTVs) alone is a rich\nand increasingly relevant dynamical problem. In this work, we evaluate the\nextent of the degeneracies in this process, systematically explore the\ndependence of TTV signals on several parameters and provide phase space plots\nthat could aid observers in planning future observations. Our explorations are\nfocused on a likely-to-be prevalent situation: a known transiting short-period\nNeptune or Jupiter-sized planet and a suspected external low-mass perturber on\na nearly-coplanar orbit. Through approximately 10^7 N-body simulations, we\ndemonstrate how TTV signal amplitudes may vary by orders of magnitude due to\nslight variations in any one orbital parameter (0.001 AU in semimajor axis,\n0.005 in eccentricity, or a few degrees in orbital angles), and quantify the\nnumber of consecutive transit observations necessary in order to obtain a\nreasonable opportunity to characterize the unseen planet (approximately greater\nor equal to 50 observations).

We investigate planetary migration by\nanalytically calculating the migration rate and time within self-consistently\ncomputed, radiatively heated discs around M stars in which the effects of dust\nsettling are included.

The canonical explanation calls for the progenitor binary system to\nundergo two subsequent mass-transfer events, both of which are unstable and\nlead to a common envelope (CE). However, it has been shown that if both CE\nevents obey the standard alpha-prescription (parametrizing energy loss), it is\nnot possible to reproduce all of the observed systems. The gamma-prescription\nwas proposed as an alternative to this description, instead parametrizing the\nfraction of angular momentum carried away in dynamical-timescale mass loss. In\nthis paper, we analyze simultaneous energy and angular-momentum conservation,\nand show that the gamma-prescription cannot adequately describe a CE event for\nan arbitrary binary, nor can the first phase of mass loss always be understood\nin general as a dynamical-timescale event. We consider in detail the first\nepisode of mass transfer in binary systems with initially low companion masses,\nwith a primary mass in the range 1.0--1.3 solar masses and an initial mass\nratio between the secondary and primary stars of 0.83--0.92.

Here we test this\nresult by comparing the elliptical galaxy spectra to those of luminous globular\nclusters associated with M31. These globular clusters have similar\nmetallicities, abundance ratios and ages as massive elliptical galaxies but\ntheir low dynamical mass-to-light ratios rule out steep stellar initial mass\nfunctions (IMFs).

Dissipation from gas drag introduces secular\nGI, which proceeds even when standard GI criteria for a critical density or\nToomre's $Q$ predict stability. We include the stabilizing effects of turbulent\ndiffusion, which suppresses small scale GI. The radially wide rings that do\ncollapse contain up to $\\sim 0.1$ Earth masses of solids. Subsequent\nfragmentation of the ring (not modeled here) would produce a clan of chemically\nhomogenous planetesimals. Particle radial drift time scales (and, to a lesser\nextent, disk lifetimes and sizes) restrict the viability of secular GI to disks\nwith weak turbulent diffusion, characterized by $\\alpha \\lesssim 10^{-4}$. Thus\nmidplane dead zones are a preferred environment. Large solids with radii\n$\\gtrsim 10$ cm collapse most rapidly because they partially decouple from the\ngas disk. Smaller solids, even below $\\sim$ mm-sizes could collapse if\nparticle-driven turbulence is weakened by either localized pressure maxima or\nsuper-Solar metallicity. Comparison with simulations that include particle\nclumping by the streaming instability shows that our linear model underpredicts\nrapid, small scale gravitational collapse.

The aim of the present work is to quantify the mass-loss\nrates (dm/dt), heating efficiencies (eta), and lifetimes for the whole sample\nof transiting exoplanets, now including hot jupiters, hot neptunes, and hot\nsuper-earths. The mass-loss rates and lifetimes are estimated from an \"energy\ndiagram\" for exoplanets, which compares the planet gravitational potential\nenergy to the stellar X/EUV energy deposited in the atmosphere.

They are optically-thin to their own radiation\nand cool inefficiently. The optically-thick interior in contrast is heated only\nweakly, by re-emission from the atmosphere. The interior is colder than a\nclassical viscous model, and isothermal.\n  The magnetic fields support an extended atmosphere that absorbs the starlight\n1.5 times higher than the hydrostatic viscous model.

Accretion of high-Z material\nfrom these disks may account for the metal contamination of these WDs. It was\npreviously shown using local calculations that the Poynting-Robertson (PR) drag\nacting on the dense, optically thick disk naturally drives metal accretion onto\nthe WD at the typical rate \\dot M_{PR} \\approx 10^8 g/s. Here we extend this\nlocal analysis by exploring global evolution of the debris disk under the\naction of the PR drag for a variety of assumptions about the disk properties.\nWe find that massive disks (mass > 10^{20} g), which are optically thick to\nincident stellar radiation inevitably give rise to metal accretion at rates\n\\dot M > 0.2\\dot M_{PR}.

Large values of eccentricity and inclination can be excited and\nstrong correlations settle in among the orbital angles. This dynamical\nbehaviour, in particular for bound dust grains, can potentially cause\nsignificant asymmetries in dusty disks around solar type stars which might be\ndetected by observations. However, the amount of orbital changes due to this\nnon--gravitational perturbation is strongly limited by the collisional lifetime\nof dust particles. We show that for large values of the disk's optical depth\nthe influence of ISM flow on the disk shape is almost negligible because the\ngrains are collisionally destroyed before they can accumulate enough orbital\nchanges due to the ISM perturbations. On the other hand, for values smaller\nthan $10^{-3}$, peculiar asymmetric patterns appear in the density profile of\nthe disk when we consider 1-10 mum grains, just above the blow-out threshold.\nThe extent and relevance of these asymmetries grow for lower values of the\noptical depth. An additional sink mechanism, which may prevent the formation of\nlarge clumps and warping in the disks is related to the fast inward migration\ndue to the drag component of the forces. When a significant eccentricity is\npumped up by the ISM perturbations, the drag forces (Poynting-Robertson and in\nparticular ISM drag) drive the disk particles on fast migrating tracks leading\nthem into the star on a short timescale. It is then expected that disks with\nsmall optical depth expand inside the parent body ring all the way towards the\nstar while disks with large optical depth would not significantly extend\ninside. \n\n"}

Our goal was to detect the\nRossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect, the anomalous radial velocity observed during\neclipses of rotating stars, which can be used to study the obliquities of\nplanet-hosting stars. For WASP-1 a weak signal of a prograde orbit was detected\nwith ~2sigma confidence, and for WASP-2 no signal was detected. The resulting\nupper bounds on the RM amplitude have different implications for these two\nsystems, because of the contrasting transit geometries and the stellar types.\nBecause WASP-1 is an F7V star, and such stars are typically rapid rotators, the\nmost probable reason for the suppression of the RM effect is that the star is\nviewed nearly pole-on. This implies the WASP-1 star has a high obliquity with\nrespect to the edge-on planetary orbit. Because WASP-2 is a K1V star, and is\nexpected to be a slow rotator, no firm conclusion can be drawn about the\nstellar obliquity. Our data and our analysis contradict an earlier claim that\nWASP-2b has a retrograde orbit, thereby revoking this system's status as an\nexception to the pattern that cool stars have low obliquities. \n\n"}

CO fundamental emission is\ndetected from 14 of the YSOs in our sample. The emission line profiles show a\nrange of strengths and shapes, but can generally be classified into a broad,\nwarm component and a narrow, cool component. The broad CO emission is detected\nmore frequently from YSOs with bolometric luminosities of <15 Lsun than those\nwith >15 Lsun, and as with CO emission from CTTSs is attributed to the warm\n(~1000 K) inner AU of the disk. The CO emission from objects with high\nbolometric luminosity is produced in cooler (~320 K), narrow lines in 12CO and\nin rarer isotopologues. From some objects, the narrow lines are blueshifted by\nup to ~10 km/s, indicating a slow wind origin.

The presence of tiny grains in PPDs thus raises the\nquestion of whether the magnetorotational instability (MRI) is able to drive\nrapid accretion to be consistent with observations. Charged tiny grains have\nsimilar conduction properties as ions, whose presence leads to qualitatively\nnew behaviors in the conductivity tensor, characterized by n_bar/n_e>1, where\nn_e and n_bar denote the number densities of free electrons and all other\ncharged species respectively. In particular, Ohmic conductivity becomes\ndominated by charged grains rather than electrons when n_bar/n_e exceeds about\n10^3, and Hall and ambipolar diffusion (AD) coefficients are reduced by a\nfactor of (n_bar/n_e)^2 in the AD dominated regime relative to that in the\nOhmic regime. Applying the methodology of Bai (2011), we find that in PPDs,\nwhen PAHs are sufficiently abundant (>1e-9 per H_2), there exists a transition\nradius r_trans of about 10-20 AU, beyond which the MRI active layer extends to\nthe disk midplane. At r<r_trans, the optimistically predicted MRI-driven\naccretion rate M_dot is one to two orders of magnitude smaller than that in the\ngrain-free case, which is too small compared with the observed rates, but is in\ngeneral no smaller than the predicted M_dot with solar-abundance 0.1 micron\ngrains. At r>r_trans, we find that remarkably, the predicted M_dot exceeds the\ngrain-free case due to a net reduction of AD by charged tiny grains, and\nreaches a few times 1e-8M_Sun/yr. This is sufficient to account for the\nobserved M_dot in transitional disks.

We\nuse two-dimensional numerical simulations to investigate the evolution of\nself-gravitating discs as a function of the local cooling time and strength of\nirradiation. In the regime where the disc does not fragment, we show that local\nthermal equilibrium continues to determine the stress - which can be\nrepresented as an effective viscous alpha - out to very long cooling times (at\nleast 240 dynamical times).

Standard practice is to quantify the initial turbulent\nvelocity field in a core in terms of the amount of turbulent energy (or some\nequivalent) and the exponent in the power spectrum (n \\equiv -d log Pk /d log\nk).

However, the\nmajority of solar-type stars form in binary systems, so the impact of binary\ncompanions on protoplanetary disks is an important element in our understanding\nof planet formation. We have compiled a combined multiplicity/disk census of\nTaurus-Auriga, plus a restricted sample of close binaries in other regions, in\norder to explore the role of multiplicity in disk evolution. Our results imply\nthat the tidal influence of a close (<40 AU) binary companion significantly\nhastens the process of protoplanetary disk dispersal, as ~2/3 of all close\nbinaries promptly disperse their disks within <1 Myr after formation. However,\nprompt disk dispersal only occurs for a small fraction of wide binaries and\nsingle stars, with ~80%-90% retaining their disks for at least ~2--3 Myr (but\nrarely for more than ~5 Myr). Our new constraints on the disk clearing\ntimescale have significant implications for giant planet formation; most single\nstars have 3--5 Myr within which to form giant planets, whereas most close\nbinary systems would have to form giant planets within <1 Myr. If core\naccretion is the primary mode for giant planet formation, then gas giants in\nclose binaries should be rare. Conversely, since almost all single stars have a\nsimilar period of time within which to form gas giants, their relative rarity\nin RV surveys indicates either that the giant planet formation timescale is\nvery well-matched to the disk dispersal timescale or that features beyond the\ndisk lifetime set the likelihood of giant planet formation. \n\n"}

This\nis consistent with recent theoretical works, which indicate that the tidal Q of\nplanet-hosting stars can indeed be much larger than the values inferred from\nstellar binaries. On the other hand, recent measurements of Rossiter-McLaughlin\neffects in transiting hot Jupiter systems not only reveal that many such\nsystems have misaligned stellar spin with respect to the orbital axis, but also\nshow that systems with cooler host stars tend to have aligned spin and orbital\naxes. Winn et al. suggested that this obliquity - temperature correlation may\nbe explained by efficient damping of stellar obliquity due to tidal dissipation\nin the star. This explanation, however, is in apparent contradiction with the\nsurvival of these short-period hot Jupiters. We show that in the solar-type\nparent stars of close-in exoplanetary systems, the effective tidal Q governing\nthe damping of stellar obliquity can be much smaller than that governing\norbital decay. This is because for misaligned systems, the tidal potential\ncontains a Fourier component with frequency equal to the stellar spin frequency\n(in the rotating frame of the star). This component can excite inertial waves\nin the convective envelope of the star, and the dissipation of inertial waves\nthen leads to a spin-orbit alignment torque, but not orbital decay. By\ncontrast, for aligned systems, such inertial wave excitation is forbidden since\nthe tidal forcing frequency is much larger than the stellar spin frequency. We\nderive a general effective tidal evolution theory for misaligned binaries,\ntaking account of different tidal responses and dissipation rates for different\ntidal forcing components. \n\n"}

Our technique exploits the fact the light curve derived stellar density\nmust be the same for all planets transiting a common star. Assuming a circular\norbit, the derived stellar density departs from the true value by a predictable\nfactor, Psi, which contains information on the eccentricity of the system. By\ncomparing multiple stellar densities, any differences must be due to\neccentricity and thus meaningful constraints can be placed in the absence of\nany other information.

In common\nwith previous studies, we find that dynamos are obtained only when either the\nconductivity or the permeability is sufficiently large. However, we find that\nthe effect of these two parameters on the dynamo process are different and can\neven compete to the detriment of the dynamo. Our self-consistent approach allow\nus to analyze in detail the dynamo feedback loop. The dynamos we obtain are\ntypically dominated by an axisymmetric toroidal magnetic field and an axial\ndipole component. We show that the ability of the outer shear layer to produce\na strong toroidal field depends critically on the presence of a conducting\nouter wall, which shields the fluid from the vacuum outside. The generation of\nthe axisymmetric poloidal field, on the other hand, occurs in the equatorial\nbelt and does not depend on the wall properties. \n\n"}

Thermal inertia\ngoverns the Yarkovsky effect, a non-gravitational force which significantly\nalters the orbits of asteroids up to \\sim 20 km in diameter. Yet, very little\nhas previously been known about the thermal inertia of small asteroids\nincluding NEAs. Observational and theoretical work is reported. The thermal\nemission of asteroids has been observed in the mid-infrared (5-35 {\\mu}m)\nwavelength range using the Spitzer Space Telescope and the 3.0m IRTF. A\ndetailed thermophysical model (TPM) has been developed and extensively tested;\nthis is the first detailed TPM shown to be applicable to NEA data. Our main\nresult is the determination of the thermal inertia of 5 NEAs, increasing the\ntotal number of NEAs with measured thermal inertia to 6. For two of our\ntargets, previously available estimates are refined. Our results allow the\nfirst determination of the typical thermal inertia of NEAs, which is around 300\nJ s^{-1/2} K^{-1} m^{-2}, larger than the typical thermal inertia of large\nmain-belt asteroids (MBAs) by more than an order of magnitude. In particular,\nthermal inertia appears to increase with decreasing asteroid diameter. Our\nresults have been used by colleagues to estimate the size dependence of the\nYarkovsky effect, thus explaining the apparent difference in the size-frequency\ndistribution of NEAs and similarly sized MBAs.

The planets invoked in that work were\nsignificantly more massive than Jupiter, and moved on orbits that were mutually\ncrossing - an architecture which suggests that mutual encounters and strong\ngravitational interactions are almost guaranteed. In this work, we perform a\nhighly detailed analysis of the proposed HW Vir planetary system. First, we\nconsider the dynamical stability of the system as proposed in the discovery\nwork. Through a mapping process involving 91,125 individual simulations, we\nfind that the system is so unstable that the planets proposed simply cannot\nexist, due to mean lifetimes of less than a thousand years across the whole\nparameter space. We then present a detailed re-analysis of the observational\ndata on HW Vir, deriving a new orbital solution that provides a very good fit\nto the observational data. Our new analysis yields a system with planets more\nwidely spaced, and of lower mass, than that proposed in the discovery work, and\nyields a significantly greater (and more realistic) estimate of the uncertainty\nin the orbit of the outermost body. Despite this, a detailed dynamical analysis\nof this new solution similarly reveals that it also requires the planets to\nmove on orbits that are simply not dynamically feasible. Our results imply that\nsome mechanism other than the influence of planetary companions must be the\nprincipal cause of the observed eclipse timing variations for HW Vir. If the\nsys- tem does host exoplanets, they must move on orbits differing greatly from\nthose previously proposed. Our results illustrate the critical importance of\nperforming dynamical analyses as a part of the discovery process for\nmultiple-planet exoplanetary systems. \n\n"}

We\nnumerically investigate how the coupled effect of collisions and radiation\npressure can affect the formation and survival of radial and azimutal\nstructures in a disc perturbed by a planet. We consider two set-ups: a planet\nembedded within an extended disc and a planet exterior to an inner debris ring.\nWe use the DyCoSS code of Thebault(2012) and derive synthetic images of the\nsystem in scattered light. The planet's mass and orbit, as well as the disc's\ncollisional activity are explored as free parameters.\n  We find that collisions always significantly damp planet-induced structures.\nFor the case of an embedded planet, the planet's signature, mostly a density\ngap around its radial position, should remain detectable in head-on images if\nM_planet > M_Saturn. If the system is seen edge-on, however, inferring the\npresence of the planet is much more difficult, although some planet-induced\nsignatures might be observable under favourable conditions.\n  For the inner-ring/external-planet case, planetary perturbations cannot\nprevent collision-produced small fragments from populating the regions beyond\nthe ring: The radial luminosity profile exterior to the ring is close to the\none it should have in the absence of the planet.

We show that turbulent\nsystems are always gravitationally unstable (in a probabilistic sense). The\nfragmentation mass spectra, size/mass relations, correlation functions, range\nof scales over which fragmentation occurs, & time-dependent rates of\nfragmentation are predictable.

We also generalize to include\nrotation, complicated equations of state, collapsing/expanding backgrounds,\nmagnetic fields, intermittency, & non-normal statistics. We derive how\nfragmentation is suppressed with 'stiffer' equations of state or different\ndriving mechanisms. Suppression appears at an 'effective sonic scale' where\nMach(R,rho)~1.

Our calculations focus on the protostellar mass\naccretion phase, after a pair of stellar 'seeds' have already formed. We find\nthat, in dense cores magnetized to a realistic level, the angular momentum of\nthe gas accreted by the protobinary is greatly reduced by magnetic braking.\nAccretion of strongly braked material shrinks the protobinary separation by a\nlarge factor compared to the non-magnetic case. The magnetic braking also\nchanges the evolution of the mass ratio of unequal-mass protobinaries by\nproducing gas of low specific angular momentum that accretes preferentially\nonto the primary rather than the secondary. This is in contrast with the\npreferential mass accretion onto the secondary previously found for\nprotobinaries accreting from an unmagnetized envelope, which tends to drive the\nmass ratio towards unity. In addition, the magnetic field greatly modifies the\nmorphology and dynamics of the protobinary accretion flow.

In 47 Tuc\nwe found tight relations between the colours of the stars and their abundances\nof p-capture elements. This strongly supports the idea that the He content -\nwhich is expected to be closely correlated with the abundances of p-capture\nelements - is the third parameter (after overall metallicity and age) that\ndetermines the colour of HB stars. However, the range in He abundance must be\nsmall (Delta Y<0.03) in 47 Tuc to reproduce our observations; this agrees with\nprevious analyses. There is possibly a correlation between the abundances of p-\nand n-capture elements in 47 Tuc.

We verify this result with numerical integrations of the\nrestricted three-body problem. We show that for the 3:2 resonance, where the\nobserved peak-trough structure is strongest, our simple model is consistent\nwith the observations for a range of mean planet masses 20-100M_{\\oplus}. This\nmass range is higher than expected, by at least a factor of three, from the few\nKepler planets with measured masses, but part of this discrepancy could be due\nto oversimplifications in the dynamical model or uncertainties in the planetary\nmass-radius relation. \n\n"}

Within a range of 3.5 to 10 kpc, the vertical\ntide from the Galactic disc is predominant. Interior to 3.5 kpc, the effects of\nthe Galactic bulge cannot be neglected and the in-plane tidal components are as\nimportant as the vertical ones.

In both cases the host stars are well-aligned with\nthe orbital planes of the planets. For KOI-94 we find \\lambda=-11+-11 deg,\nconfirming a recent result by Hirano and coworkers. Kepler-25 was a more\nchallenging case because the transit depth is unusually small (0.13 %). To\nobtain the obliquity it was necessary to use prior knowledge of the star's\nprojected rotation rate, and apply two different analysis methods to\nindependent wavelength regions of the spectra. The two methods gave consistent\nresults, \\lambda=7+-8 deg and -0.5+-5.7 deg.\n  There are now a total of five obliquity measurements for host stars of\nsystems of multiple transiting planets, all of which are consistent with\nspin-orbit alignment. This alignment is unlikely to be the result of tidal\ninteractions, because of the relatively large orbital distances and low\nplanetary masses in the systems. In this respect the multiplanet host stars\ndiffer from hot-Jupiter host stars, which commonly have large spin-orbit\nmisalignments whenever tidal interactions are weak. In particular the weak-tide\nsubset of hot-Jupiter hosts have obliquities consistent with an isotropic\ndistribution (p=0.6), but the multiplanet hosts are incompatible with such a\ndistribution (p~10^-6).

These objects, which show significant mid-infrared excess\nemission, are embedded in a diffuse loop structure of ~1 arcmin in radius.\nTheir near-infrared spectra reveal characteristics of late O- or early B-type\nstars with numerous H and He I absorption lines, and we classify their spectral\ntypes to be between O9 and B2 based on an empirical relation derived here\nbetween the equivalent widths of the H lines and stellar photospheric\ntemperatures.

Abstract: On 2013 November 28 Comet ISON (C/2012 S1) will pass by the Sun with a\nperihelion distance of 2.7 solar radii. Understanding the possible outcomes for\nthe comet's response to such a close passage by the Sun is important for\nplanning observational campaigns and for inferring ISON's physical properties.\nWe present new numerical simulations and interpret them in context with the\nhistorical track record of comet disruptions and of sungrazing comet behavior.\nHistorical data suggest that sizes below ~200 m are susceptible to destruction\nby sublimation driven mass loss, while we find that for ISON's perihelion\ndistance, densities lower than 0.1 g cm^-3 are required to tidally disrupt a\nretrograde or non-spinning body. Such low densities are substantially below the\nrange of the best-determined comet nucleus densities, though dynamically new\ncomets such as ISON have few measurements of physical properties. Disruption\nmay occur for prograde rotation at densities up to 0.7 g cm^-3, with the\nchances of disruption increasing for lower density, faster prograde rotation,\nand increasing elongation of the nucleus. Given current constraints on ISON's\nnucleus properties and the typically determined values for these properties\namong all comets, we find tidal disruption to be unlikely unless other factors\n(e.g., spin-up via torquing) affect ISON substantially. Whether or not\ndisruption occurs, the largest remnant must be big enough to survive subsequent\nmass loss due to sublimation in order for ISON to remain a viable comet well\nafter perihelion. \n\n"}

This approach\nrelies on a combined use of a new generation of high-speed cameras which allow\nshort, high frame-rate exposures of moving objects, effectively \"freezing\"\ntheir motion, and a computationally enhanced implementation of the\n\"shift-and-add\" data processing technique that helps to improve the signal to\nnoise ratio (SNR) for detection of NEA's. The SNR of a single short exposure of\na dim NEA is insufficient to detect it in one frame, but by computationally\nsearching for an appropriate velocity vector, shifting successive frames\nrelative to each other and then co-adding the shifted frames in\npost-processing, we synthetically create a long-exposure image as if the\ntelescope were tracking the object. This approach, which we call \"synthetic\ntracking,\" enhances the familiar shift-and-add technique with the ability to do\na wide blind search, detect, and track dim and fast-moving NEA's in near real\ntime. We discuss also how synthetic tracking improves the astrometry of fast\nmoving NEA's. We apply this technique to observations of two known asteroids\nconducted on the Palomar 200-inch telescope and demonstrate improved SNR and\n10-fold improvement of astrometric precision over the traditional long exposure\napproach.

Strong pressure-broadened Na and K absorption signatures are also\nexcluded, as are significant metal-hydride features. We compare our combined\nbroadband spectrum to a wide variety of existing aerosol-free atmospheric\nmodels, though none are satisfactory fits. However, we do find that the full\ntransmission spectrum can be described by models which include significant\nopacity from aerosols: including Rayleigh scattering, Mie scattering, tholin\nhaze, and settling dust profiles. The transmission spectrum follows an\neffective extinction cross section with a power-law of index alpha, with the\nslope of the transmission spectrum constraining the quantity alphaT =\n-3528+/-660 K, where T is the atmospheric temperature. Rayleigh scattering\n(alpha=-4) is among the best fitting models, though requires low terminator\ntemperatures near 900 K. Sub-micron size aerosol particles can provide equally\ngood fits to the entire transmission spectrum for a wide range of temperatures,\nand we explore corundum as a plausible dust aerosol.

While it is usually agreed that single-degenerate progenitor\nsystems would be luminous supersoft X-ray sources (SSSs), it was recently\nsuggested that double-degenerate progenitors might also go through a SSS phase.\nAims: We aim to examine the possibility of double-degenerate progenitor systems\nbeing SSSs, and place stringent upper limits on the maximally possible\ndurations of any SSS phases and expected number of these systems in a galactic\npopulation. Method: We employ the binary population synthesis code SeBa to\nexamine the mass-transfer characteristics of a possible SSS phase of\ndouble-degenerate type Ia SN progenitor systems for 1) the standard SeBa\nassumptions, and 2) an optimistic best-case scenario. The latter case\nestablishes firm upper limits on the possible population of supersoft source\ndouble-degenerate type Ia SN progenitor systems. Results: Our results indicate\nthat unlike what is expected for single-degenerate progenitor systems, the vast\nmajority of the material accreted by either pure wind mass transfer or a\ncombination of wind and RLOF mass transfer is helium rather than hydrogen. Even\nwith extremely optimistic assumptions concerning the mass-transfer and\nretention efficiencies, the average mass accreted by systems that eventually\nbecome double-degenerate type Ia SNe is small. Consequently, the lengths of\ntime that these systems may be SSSs are short, even under optimal conditions,\nand the expected number of such systems in a galactic population is negligible.\nConclusions: The population of double-degenerate type Ia SN progenitors that\nare SSSs is at least an order of magnitude smaller than the population of\nsingle-degenerate progenitors expected to be SSSs, and the supersoft X-ray\nbehaviour of double-degenerate systems typically ceases long before the SN\nexplosions. \n\n"}

We study how large-scale poloidal fields evolve in accretion disks,\nwith the primary aim of quantifying the viability of magnetic accretion\nmechanisms in protoplanetary disks. We employ a kinematic mean-field model for\npoloidal field transport and focus on steady states where inward advection of a\nfield balances with outward diffusion due to effective resistivities. We\nanalytically derive the steady-state radial distribution of poloidal fields in\nhighly conducting accretion disks. The analytic solution reveals an upper limit\non the strength of large-scale vertical fields attainable in steady states. Any\nexcess poloidal field will be diffused away within a finite time, and we\ndemonstrate this with time-dependent numerical calculations of the mean-field\nequations. We apply this upper limit to large-scale vertical fields threading\nprotoplanetary disks. We find that the maximum attainable strength is about 0.1\nG at 1 AU, and about 1 mG at 10 AU from the central star. When combined with\nrecent magnetic accretion models, the maximum field strength translates into\nthe maximum steady-state accretion rate of $\\sim 10^{-7} M_\\odot {\\rm\nyr}^{-1}$, in agreement with observations. We also find that the maximum field\nstrength is ~ 1 kG at the surface of the central star provided that the disk\nextends down to the stellar surface.

It takes\nadvantage of the fact that the source position is known precisely from the\nmicrolensing event itself. We apply this method to the event MOA-2011-BLG-262,\nwhich has a short timescale t_E=3.8 day, a companion mass ratio q=0.0047 and a\nvery high or high lens-source relative proper motion mu_rel=20 mas/yr or 12\nmas/yr (for two possible models).

Systems with 3-6 low-mass planets (or planet\ncandidates) produce a diversity of minimum-mass disks with surface density\nprofiles ranging from Sigma r^-3.2 to Sigma r^0.5 (5th-95th percentile). By\nsimulating the transit detection of populations of synthetic planetary systems\ndesigned to match the properties of observed super-Earth systems, we show that\na universal disk profile is statistically excluded at high confidence.

Assuming\nthat these emissions are caused by magnetic cycles similar to the sunspot\ncycle, we construct flux transport dynamo models of $1M_{\\odot}$ stars rotating\nwith different rotation periods. We first compute the differential rotation and\nthe meridional circulation inside these stars from a mean-field hydrodynamics\nmodel. Then these are substituted in our dynamo code to produce periodic\nsolutions. We find that the dimensionless amplitude $f_m$ of the toroidal flux\nthrough the star increases with decreasing rotation period. The observational\ndata can be matched if we assume the emissions to go as the power 3-4 of $f_m$.\nAssuming that the Babcock-Leighton mechanism saturates with increasing\nrotation, we can provide an explanation for the observed saturation of emission\nat low Rossby numbers. The main failure of our model is that it predicts an\nincrease of magnetic cycle period with increasing rotation rate, which is the\nopposite of what is found observationally. Much of our calculations are based\non the assumption that the magnetic buoyancy makes the magnetic flux tubes to\nrise radially from the bottom of the convection zone.

Using high-resolution\nobservations of plage magnetic fields made with the Solar Optical Telescope\naboard the Hinode satellite, we investigate this idea by estimating the upward\ntransport of magnetic energy --- the vertical Poynting flux, S_z --- across the\nphotosphere in a plage region.

Plage fields are ideal observational targets for\nestimating energy injection by convection, because they are: (i) strong enough\nto be measured with relatively small uncertainties; (ii) not so strong that\nconvection is heavily suppressed (as within umbrae); and (iii) unipolar, so S_z\nin plage is not influenced by mixed-polarity processes (e.g., flux emergence)\nunrelated to heating in stable, active-region fields.

Based\non our dynamical mass for Gl 417BC (L4.5+L6) and a gyrochronology system age\nfrom its young, solar-type host star, commonly used models predict luminosities\n0.2$-$0.4 dex lower than we observe.

Using different variants of the\ntest-field method, we determine the quenching of the turbulent transport\ncoefficients for the forced Roberts flow, isotropically forced non-helical\nturbulence, and rotating thermal convection.

Migration can be inward or outward depending on the local\ndisk properties but, in general, only planets more massive than several\n$M_\\oplus$ can migrate outward. Here we propose that an embryo's migration\nhistory determines whether it becomes a hot super-Earth or the core of a giant\nplanet. Systems of hot super-Earths (or mini-Neptunes) form when embryos\nmigrate inward and pile up at the inner edge of the disk. Giant planet cores\nform when inward-migrating embryos become massive enough to switch direction\nand migrate outward. We present simulations of this process using a modified\nN-body code, starting from a swarm of planetary embryos. Systems of hot\nsuper-Earths form in resonant chains with the innermost planet at or interior\nto the disk inner edge. Resonant chains are disrupted by late dynamical\ninstabilities triggered by the dispersal of the gaseous disk. Giant planet\ncores migrate outward toward zero-torque zones, which move inward and\neventually disappear as the disk disperses. Giant planet cores migrate inward\nwith these zones and are stranded at ~1-5 AU. Our model reproduces several\nproperties of the observed extra-solar planet populations. The frequency of\ngiant planet cores increases strongly when the mass in solids is increased,\nconsistent with the observed giant exoplanet - stellar metallicity correlation.\nThe frequency of hot super-Earths is not a function of stellar metallicity,\nalso in agreement with observations. Our simulations can reproduce the broad\ncharacteristics of the observed super-Earth population. \n\n"}

The bright and\nwell studied HAT-P-7 system is intriguing as several Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM)\nmeasurements found a large projected obliquity in this system, but it was so\nfar not possible to determine if the orbit is polar and/or retrograde. The goal\nof this study is to measure the stellar inclination and hereby the full 3D\nobliquity of the HAT-P-7 system instead of only the 2D projection as measured\nby the RM effect. In addition we provide an updated set of stellar parameters\nfor the star. We use the full set of available observations from Kepler\nspanning Q0-Q17 to produce the power spectrum of HAT-P-7. We extract\noscillation mode frequencies via an MCMC peak-bagging routine, and use the\nresults from this to estimate the stellar inclination angle. Combining this\nwith the projected obliquity from RM and the inclination of the orbital plane\nallows us to determine the stellar obliquity. We use asteroseismology to model\nthe star from the extracted frequencies using two different approaches to the\nmodelling where either the MESA or the GARSTEC stellar evolution codes are\nadopted. Using our updated asteroseismic modelling we find, i.a., the following\nstellar parameters for HAT-P-7: M=1.51{+0.04}{-0.05}Msun,\n$R=2.00{+0.01}{-0.02}Rsun, and age = 2.07{+0.28}{-0.23} Gyr. Our asteroseismic\nmodelling offers a high precision on the stellar parameters, for instance is\nthe uncertainty on age of the order ~11%. For the stellar inclination we\nestimate i_star<36.5 deg., which translates to an obliquity between 83 and 111\ndeg. We find that the planet HAT-P-7b is likely retrograde in its orbit, and\nthat the orbit is close to being polar.

The data set consists of both early\nand late-time observations, including the first late phase NIR spectrum\nobtained for a spectroscopically classified SN Iax.

Constraints from the distribution of IMEs, e.g. silicon and\nmagnesium, indicate that the outer ejecta did not experience significant mixing\nduring or after burning, and the late phase NIR line profiles suggests most of\nthe (56)Ni is produced during high density burning.

The orbit of a\nplanet around a binary stellar system poses several dynamic constraints. The\neffects that radiation from the host stars may have on the planet atmospheres\nmust be considered. Because of the configuration of a close binary system,\nthese stars have a high rotation rate, which causes a permanent state of high\nstellar activity and copious XUV radiation. The accumulated effects are\nstronger than for exoplanets around single stars, and cause a faster\nevaporation of their atmospheres. We evaluate the effects that stellar\nradiation has on the evaporation of exoplanets around binary systems and on the\nsurvival of these planets. We considered the XUV spectral range to account for\nthe photons that are easily absorbed by a planet atmosphere that is mainly\ncomposed of hydrogen. A more complex atmospheric composition is expected to\nabsorb this radiation more efficiently. We used direct X-ray observations to\nevaluate the energy in the X-rays range and coronal models to calculate the\n(nondetectable) EUV part of the spectrum. The simulations show that exoplanets\nin a close orbit will suffer strong photoevaporation that may cause a total\nloss of atmosphere in a short time. A binary system of two solar-like stars\nwill be highly efficient in evaporating the atmosphere of the planet. These\nsystems will be difficult to find, even if they are dynamically stable. Still,\nplanets may orbit around binary systems of low mass stars for wider orbits.\nCurrently known circumbinary planets are not substantially affected by thermal\nphotoevaporation processes, unless Kepler-47 b has an inflated atmosphere. The\ndistribution of the orbital periods of circumbinary planets is shifted to much\nlonger periods than the average of Kepler planets, which supports a scenario of\nstrong photoevaporation in close-in circumbinary planets. \n\n"}

This augmented method is presented here, and numerous\napplications are conveyed. In alignment with Paper I, the selected approach\nconsiders a variety of aspects, which comprise the consideration of a joint\nconstraint including orbital stability and a habitable region for a possible\nsystem planet through the stellar radiative energy fluxes (\"radiative habitable\nzone\"; RHZ). The devised method is based on a combined formalism for the\nassessment of both S-type and P-type habitability; in particular, mathematical\ncriteria are deduced for which kinds of systems S-type and P-type habitable\nzones are realized. If the RHZs are truncated by the additional constraint of\norbital stability, the notation of ST-type and PT-type habitability applies. In\ncomparison to the circular case, it is found that in systems of higher\neccentricity, the range of the RHZs is significantly reduced. Moreover, for a\nconsiderable number of models, the orbital stability constraint also reduces\nthe range of S-type and P-type habitability.

We hypothesize that the\nin-situ breakup of small bodies such as asteroids spun to fission during the\ngiant branch phases of stellar evolution provides an important contribution to\nthis debris. The YORP effect, which arises from radiation pressure, accelerates\nthe spin rate of asymmetric asteroids, which can eventually shear themselves\napart. This pressure is maintained and enhanced around dying stars because the\noutward push of an asteroid due to stellar mass loss is insignificant compared\nto the resulting stellar luminosity increase. Consequently, giant star\nradiation will destroy nearly all bodies with radii in the range 100 m - 10 km\nthat survive their parent star's main sequence lifetime within a distance of\nabout 7 au; smaller bodies are spun apart to their strongest, competent\ncomponents.

No significant effect on temperatures or metallicities with\n  ARES+MOOG in LTE Abstract: Precise stellar parameters are crucial for several reasons, amongst which are\nthe precise characterization of orbiting exoplanets and the correct\ndetermination of galactic chemical evolution. The atmospheric parameters are\nextremely important because all the other stellar parameters depend on them.\nUsing our standard equivalent-width method on high-resolution spectroscopy,\ngood precision can be obtained for the derived effective temperature and\nmetallicity. The surface gravity, however, is usually not well constrained with\nspectroscopy. We use two different samples of FGK dwarfs to study the effect of\nthe stellar surface gravity on the precise spectroscopic determination of the\nother atmospheric parameters. Furthermore, we present a straightforward formula\nfor correcting the spectroscopic surface gravities derived by our method and\nwith our linelists. Our spectroscopic analysis is based on Kurucz models in\nLTE, performed with the MOOG code to derive the atmospheric parameters. The\nsurface gravity was either left free or fixed to a predetermined value. The\nlatter is either obtained through a photometric transit light curve or derived\nusing asteroseismology. We find first that, despite some minor trends, the\neffective temperatures and metallicities for FGK dwarfs derived with the\ndescribed method and linelists are, in most cases, only affected within the\nerrorbars by using different values for the surface gravity, even for very\nlarge differences in surface gravity, so they can be trusted. The temperatures\nderived with a fixed surface gravity continue to be compatible within 1 sigma\nwith the accurate results of the InfraRed Flux Method (IRFM), as is the case\nfor the unconstrained temperatures. Secondly, we find that the spectroscopic\nsurface gravity can easily be corrected to a more accurate value using a linear\nfunction with the effective temperature. \n\n"}

We recover the observed number of systems containing between 2 and 5\ntransiting planets if every M dwarf hosts 6.1+/-1.9 planets with typical mutual\ninclinations of 2.0 +4.0-2.0 degrees. This range includes the Solar System in\nits coplanarity and multiplicity.

We solve for gas streamlines including the\nindirect stellar potential in the frame rotating with the pattern speed, under\nthe drastic simplification that gas does not feel its own gravity. Near\nco-rotation, the gas disk takes the form of a horseshoe-shaped annulus.

Many observed short period gas\ngiant planets also have orbits that are misaligned with respect to their star's\nspin axis, which has also been attributed to the presence of a massive outer\ncompanion on a non-coplanar orbit.

Yet the connection between\nhost star metallicity and the properties of small planets is only just\nbeginning to be investigated. It has recently been argued that the metallicity\ndistribution of stars with exoplanet candidates identified by Kepler provides\nevidence for three distinct clusters of exoplanets, distinguished by planet\nradius boundaries at 1.7 R_Earth and 3.9 R_Earth. This would suggest that there\nare three distinct planet formation pathways for super-Earths, mini-Neptunes,\nand giant planets. However, as I show through three independent analyses, there\nis actually no evidence for the proposed radius boundary at 1.7 R_Earth. On the\nother hand, a more rigorous calculation demonstrates that a single, continuous\nrelationship between planet radius and metallicity is a better fit to the data.\nThe planet radius and metallicity data therefore provides no evidence for\ndistinct categories of small planets. This suggests that the planet formation\nprocess in a typical protoplanetary disk produces a continuum of planet sizes\nbetween 1 R_Earth and 4 R_Earth. As a result, the currently available planet\nradius and metallicity data for solar-metallicity F and G stars give no reason\nto expect that the amount of solid material in a protoplanetary disk determines\nwhether super-Earths or mini-Neptunes are formed. \n\n"}

Such a strategy requires urgent action:\nkey instrumentation needs to be sustained, and action needs to be taken before\ncore capabilities are lost in the aging ensemble. We recommend advances through\npriority focus (1) on observation-based modeling throughout the Sun-Earth\nsystem, (2) on forecasts more than 12 hrs ahead of the magnetic structure of\nincoming coronal mass ejections, (3) on understanding the geospace response to\nvariable solar-wind stresses that lead to intense geomagnetically-induced\ncurrents and ionospheric and radiation storms, and (4) on developing a\ncomprehensive specification of space climate, including the characterization of\nextreme space storms to guide resilient and robust engineering of technological\ninfrastructures. The roadmap clusters its implementation recommendations by\nformulating three action pathways, and outlines needed instrumentation and\nresearch programs and infrastructure for each of these.

An\nearly collision between the two partners likely produced the binary and a\nnarrow ring of debris, out of which arose the moons Styx, Nix, Kerberos and\nHydra. How the satellites emerged from the compact ring is uncertain. Here we\nshow that a particle ring spreads from physical collisions and collective\ngravitational scattering, similar to migration. Around a binary, these\nprocesses take place in the reference frames of \"most circular\" orbits, akin to\ncircular ones in a Keplerian potential. Ring particles damp to these orbits and\navoid destructive collisions. Damping and diffusion also help particles survive\ndynamical instabilities driven by resonances with the binary. In some\nsituations, particles become trapped near resonances that sweep outward with\nthe tidal evolution of the Pluto-Charon binary. With simple models and\nnumerical experiments, we show how the Pluto-Charon impact ring may have\nexpanded into a broad disk, out of which grew the circumbinary moons. In some\nscenarios, the ring can spread well beyond the orbit of Hydra, the most distant\nmoon, to form a handful of smaller satellites.

We\nestimate the magnitude change between a series of target/impactor pairs,\nassuming it is given by the increase in reflecting surface area within a\nphotometric aperture due to the resulting ejecta. As expected the photometric\nsignal increases with impactor size, but we find also that the photometric\nsignature decreases rapidly as the target asteroid diameter increases, due to\ngravitational fallback. We have used the model results to make an estimate of\nthe impactor diameter for the (596) Scheila collision of D=49-65m depending on\nthe impactor taxonomy, which is broadly consistent with previous estimates. We\nvaried both the strength regime (highly porous and sand/cohesive soil) and the\ntaxonomic type (S-, C- and D-type) to examine the effect on the magnitude\nchange, finding that it is significant at early stages but has only a small\neffect on the overall lifetime of the photometric signal.

When the recombination time is long compared to the flow\ntime-scale the ionization front becomes thick and encompasses the entire flow,\nwith the mass-loss rate scaling linearly with flux. If the planet's potential\nis deep the flow is approximately \"energy-limited\"; however, if the planet's\npotential is shallow we identify a new limiting mass-loss regime, which we term\n\"photon-limited\".

Here, I present the main conclusions from a\ncomprehensive atmospheric retrieval survey of eight hot Jupiters with\ndetectable molecular absorption in their near-infrared transmission spectra. I\nanalyze the eight transmission spectra using the newly-developed,\nself-consistent atmospheric retrieval framework, SCARLET. Unlike previous\nmethods, SCARLET combines the physical and chemical consistency of complex\natmospheric models with the statistical treatment of observational\nuncertainties known from atmospheric retrieval techniques. I find that all\neight hot Jupiters consistently require carbon-to-oxygen ratios (C/O) below\n0.9. The finding of C/O<0.9 is highly robust for HD209458b, WASP-12b, WASP-19b,\nHAT-P-1b, and XO-1b. For HD189733b, WASP-17b, and WASP-43b, I find that the\npublished WFC3 transmission spectra favor C/O<0.9 at greater than 95%\nconfidence. I further show that the water abundances on all eight hot Jupiters\nare consistent with solar composition. The relatively small depth of the\ndetected water absorption features is due to the presence of clouds, not due to\na low water abundance as previously suggested for HD209458b.

The\nVSI is driven by a weak vertical gradient in the disk's orbital motion, but\nmust overcome vertical buoyancy, a strongly stabilizing influence in cold\ndisks, where heating is dominated by external irradiation. Rapid radiative\ncooling reduces the effective buoyancy and allows the VSI to operate. We\nquantify the cooling timescale $t_c$ needed for efficient VSI growth, through a\nlinear analysis of the VSI with cooling in vertically global, radially local\ndisk models. We find the VSI is most vigorous for rapid cooling with\n$t_c<\\Omega_\\mathrm{K}^{-1}h|q|/(\\gamma -1)$ in terms of the Keplerian orbital\nfrequency, $\\Omega_\\mathrm{K}$; the disk's aspect-ratio, $h\\ll1$; the radial\npower-law temperature gradient, $q$; and the adiabatic index, $\\gamma$. For\nlonger $t_c$, the VSI is much less effective because growth slows and shifts to\nsmaller length scales, which are more prone to viscous or turbulent decay. We\napply our results to PPD models where $t_c$ is determined by the opacity of\ndust grains. We find that the VSI is most effective at intermediate radii, from\n$\\sim5$AU to $\\sim50$AU with a characteristic growth time of $\\sim30$ local\norbital periods. Growth is suppressed by long cooling times both in the opaque\ninner disk and the optically thin outer disk. Reducing the dust opacity by a\nfactor of 10 increases cooling times enough to quench the VSI at all disk\nradii.

Its location is determined by the properties of the star, the mass\naccretion rate through the disk, and the size distribution of dust suspended in\nthe disk. We calculate the snow line location from recent observations of mass\naccretion rates and as a function of stellar mass. By taking the observed\ndispersion in mass accretion rates as a measure of the dispersion in initial\ndisk mass, we find that stars of a given mass will exhibit a range of snow line\nlocations. At a given age and stellar mass, the observed dispersion in mass\naccretion rates of 0.4 dex naturally leads to a dispersion in snow line\nlocations of 0.2 dex. For ISM-like dust sizes, the one-sigma snow line location\namong solar mass stars of the same age ranges from 2 to 5 au. For more\nrealistic dust opacities that include larger grains, the snow line is located\nup to two times closer to the star. We use these locations and the outcome of\nN-body simulations to predict the amount of water delivered to terrestrial\nplanets that formed in situ in the habitable zone.

We focus here on systems in\nwhich the mass loss occurs slowly (\"stable mass transfer\" in the language of\nbinary star evolution) and we compute their evolution in detail with the binary\nevolution code MESA. We include the effects of tides, RLO, irradiation and\nphoto-evaporation of the planet, as well as the stellar wind and magnetic\nbraking. Our calculations all start with a hot Jupiter close to its Roche\nlimit, in orbit around a sun-like star. The initial orbital decay and onset of\nRLO are driven by tidal dissipation in the star.

The disc itself evolves on time-scales of several Myr during which\nboth temperature and density profiles change as matter accretes onto the\ncentral star. Here we use a detailed model of an evolving disc to determine the\ngrowth of planets by pebble accretion and their migration through the disc.\nCores that reach their pebble isolation mass accrete gas to finally form giant\nplanets with extensive gas envelopes, while planets that do not reach pebble\nisolation mass are stranded as ice giants and ice planets containing only minor\namounts of gas in their envelopes. Unlike earlier population synthesis models,\nour model works without any artificial reductions in migration speed and for\nprotoplanetary discs with gas and dust column densities similar to those\ninferred from observations. We find that in our nominal disc model the\nemergence of planetary embryos preferably occurs after approximately 2 Myr in\norder to not exclusively form gas giants, but also ice giants and smaller\nplanets. The high pebble accretion rates ensure that critical core masses for\ngas accretion can be reached at all orbital distances.

Whether O$_{2}$ and CO can accumulate\nto appreciable concentrations depends on the ratio of far-UV to near-UV\nradiation coming from the planet's parent star and on what happens to these\ngases when they dissolve in a planet's oceans. Using a one-dimensional\nphotochemical model, we demonstrate that O$_{2}$ derived from CO$_{2}$\nphotolysis should not accumulate to measurable concentrations on planets around\nF- and G-type stars. K-star, and especially M-star planets, however, may build\nup O$_{2}$ because of the low near-UV flux from their parent stars, in\nagreement with some previous studies. On such planets, a 'false positive' for\nlife is possible if recombination of dissolved CO and O$_{2}$ in the oceans is\nslow and if other O$_{2}$ sinks (e.g., reduced volcanic gases or dissolved\nferrous iron) are small. O$_{3}$, on the other hand, could be detectable at UV\nwavelengths ($\\lambda$ < 300 nm) for a much broader range of boundary\nconditions and stellar types. \n\n"}

We conduct a\nlarge population synthesis study, including the octupole gravitational\npotential from the stellar companion, mutual precession of the host stellar\nspin axis and planet orbital axis, tidal dissipation in the planet, and stellar\nspin-down in the host star due to magnetic braking. We consider a range of\nplanet masses ($0.3-5\\,M_J$) and initial semi-major axes ($1-5$AU), different\nproperties for the host star, and varying tidal dissipation strengths. The\nfraction of systems that result in HJs depends on planet mass and stellar type,\nwith $f_{\\rm HJ} = 1-4\\%$ (depending on tidal dissipation strength) for\n$M_p=1\\,M_J$, and larger (up to $8\\%$) for more massive planets.

A slowdown in\nthe evolutionary cooling prior to equilibrium is possible only for sources\nwhich do not extend to the planet's center. We estimate the Ohmic dissipation\nresulting from the interaction between the atmospheric winds and the planet's\nmagnetic field, and apply our analytical model to Ohmically heated planets.

We recover, for the first time in the Kepler data, the\ndifferent populations of giant planets reported by radial velocity surveys.\nComparing these rates with other yields, we find that the occurrence rate of\ngiant planets is lower only for hot jupiters but not for the longer period\nplanets.

Abstract: The obliquities of planet-hosting stars are clues about the formation of\nplanetary systems. Previous observations led to the hypothesis that for\nclose-in giant planets, spin-orbit alignment is enforced by tidal interactions.\nHere, we examine two problems with this hypothesis. First, Mazeh and coworkers\nrecently used a new technique -- based on the amplitude of starspot-induced\nphotometric variability -- to conclude that spin-orbit alignment is common even\nfor relatively long-period planets, which would not be expected if tides were\nresponsible. We re-examine the data and find a statistically significant\ncorrelation between photometric variability and planetary orbital period that\nis qualitatively consistent with tidal interactions. However it is still\ndifficult to explain quantitatively, as it would require tides to be effective\nfor periods as long as tens of days. Second, Rogers and Lin argued against a\nparticular theory for tidal re-alignment by showing that initially retrograde\nsystems would fail to be re-aligned, in contradiction with the observed\nprevalence of prograde systems. We investigate a simple model that overcomes\nthis problem by taking into account the dissipation of inertial waves and the\nequilibrium tide, as well as magnetic braking. We identify a region of\nparameter space where re-alignment can be achieved, but it only works for\nclose-in giant planets, and requires some fine tuning. Thus, while we find both\nproblems to be more nuanced than they first appeared, the tidal model still has\nserious shortcomings. \n\n"}

Such a density difference would pose a problem for any formation\nmechanism if their current densities were representative of their composition\nat formation. However, both planets are at close enough separations to have\nundergone significant evaporation in the past. We constrain the core-mass, core\ncomposition, initial envelope-mass, and initial cooling-time of each planet\nusing evaporation models conditioned on their present-day masses and radii, as\ninferred from Kepler photometry and transit timing analysis. The inner planet\nis consistent with being an evaporatively stripped core, while the outer planet\nhas retained some of its initial envelope due to its higher core-mass.\nTherefore, both planets could have had a similar formation pathway, with the\ninner planet having an initial envelope-mass fraction of $\\lesssim 10\\%$ and\ncore-mass of $\\sim4.4$ M$_\\oplus$, while the outer had an initial envelope-mass\nfraction of order 15-30\\% and core-mass $\\sim7.3$ M$_\\oplus$.

HD 189733b is arguably the most well observed exoplanet\nto date and the only exoplanet to be observed in polarized light, yet it is\ndebated if the planet's atmosphere is cloudy or clear. We model reflected light\nfrom clear atmospheres with Rayleigh scattering, and cloudy or hazy atmospheres\nwith Mie and fractal aggregate particles. We show that clear and cloudy\natmospheres have large differences in polarized light as compared to simple\nflux measurements, though existing observations are insufficient to make this\ndistinction.

In\nthis late stage, a significant amount of ice could have been delivered to 1 AU\nfrom outer regions in the form of mm to dm-sized pebbles. This raises the\nquestion why the present Earth is so depleted of water (with the ocean mass\nbeing as small as 0.023% of the Earth mass). Here we quantify the amount of icy\npebbles accreted by terrestrial embryos after the migration of the snow line\nassuming that no mechanism halts the pebble flow in outer disk regions. We use\na simplified version of the coagulation equation to calculate the formation and\nradial inward drift of icy pebbles in a protoplanetary disk. The pebble\naccretion cross section of an embryo is calculated using analytic expressions\npresented by recent studies. We find that the final mass and water content of\nterrestrial embryos strongly depends on the radial extent of the gas disk, the\nstrength of disk turbulence, and the time at which the snow lines arrives at 1\nAU. The disk's radial extent sets the lifetime of the pebble flow, while\nturbulence determines the density of pebbles at the midplane where the embryos\nreside. We find that the final water content of the embryos falls below 0.023\nwt% only if the disk is compact (< 100 AU), turbulence is strong at 1 AU, and\nthe snow line arrives at 1 AU later than 2-4 Myr after disk formation. If the\nsolar nebula extended to 300 AU, initially rocky embryos would have evolved\ninto icy planets of 1-10 Earth masses unless the snow-line migration was slow.\nIf the proto-Earth contained water of ~ 1 wt% as might be suggested by the\ndensity deficit of the Earth's outer core, the formation of the proto-Earth was\npossible with weaker turbulence and with earlier (> 0.5-2 Myr) snow-line\nmigration. \n\n"}

In\nthese systems, some of the open field lines do not allow the flow to pass\nsmoothly through the sonic point, so that steady-state solutions do not exist\nin general. This paper focuses on this type of magnetic field configuration,\nwhere the resulting flow becomes manifestly time-dependent. We consider the\ncase of both steady heating and time-variable heating, and find the time scales\nfor the corresponding time variations of the outflow. Because the flow cannot\npass through the sonic transition, it remains subsonic and leads to so-called\nbreeze solutions. One manifestation of the time variability is that the flow\nsamples a collection of different breeze solutions over time, and the mass\noutflow rate varies in quasi-periodic fashion. Because the flow is subsonic,\ninformation can propagate inward from the outer boundary, which determines, in\npart, the time scale of the flow variability.

The\npresence of a DZ naturally leads to conditions susceptible to the Rossby wave\ninstability (RWI), which produces vortices and spiral density waves that may\nrevive the DZ and be responsible for observed large-scale disc structures. We\npresent a series of two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the\nrole of the RWI in DZs, including its impact on the long-term evolution of the\ndisc and its morphology. The nonlinear RWI can generate Reynolds stresses\n(effective $\\alpha$ parameter) as large as $0.01 - 0.05$ in the DZ, helping to\nsustain quasi-steady accretion throughout the disc. It also produces novel disc\nmorphologies, including azimuthal asymmetries with $m = 1, 2$, and atypical\nvortex shapes. The angular momentum transport strength and morphology are most\nsensitive to two parameters: the radial extent of the DZ and the disc\nviscosity. The largest Reynolds stresses are produced when the radial extent of\nthe DZ is less than its distance to the central star. Such narrow DZs lead to a\nsingle vortex or two coherent antipodal vortices in the quasi-steady state. The\nedges of wider DZs evolve separately, resulting in two independent vortices and\nreduced angular momentum transport efficiency. In either case, we find that,\nbecause of the Reynolds stresses generated by the nonlinear RWI, gravitational\ninstability is unlikely to play a role in angular momentum transport across the\nDZ, unless the accretion rate is sufficiently high. \n\n"}

The ion subsystem may be solid, liquid or plasma, with\nmany states of ionization with ionic charge $Z_j$. Quasi-equilibria with the\nion temperature $T_i\\ne T_e$ are common. The ion subsystem in WCM can no longer\nbe treated as a passive \"external potential\", as is customary in $T=0$ density\nfunctional theory (DFT) dominated by solid-state theory or quantum chemistry.\nHohenberg-Kohn-Mermin theory can be used for WCMs if finite-$T$\nexchange-correlation (XC) functionals are available. They are functionals of\nboth the one-body electron density $n_e$ and the one-body ion densities\n$\\rho_j$.

{"id": "1602.07098", "contents": "Title: Can brown dwarfs survive on close orbits around convective stars? Abstract: Brown dwarfs straddle the mass range transition from planetary to stellar\nobjects. There is a relative paucity of brown dwarfs companions around FGKM\nstars compared to exoplanets for orbital periods less than a few years, but\nmost of the short-period brown dwarf companions fully characterised by transits\nand radial velocities are found around F-type stars. We examine the hypothesis\nthat brown dwarf companions could not survive on close orbit around stars with\nimportant convective envelopes because the tides and angular momentum loss\nthrough magnetic breaking should lead to a rapid orbital decay and quick\nengulfment of the companion. We use a classical Skumanich-type braking law, and\nconstant time-lag tidal theory to assess the characteristic timescale for\norbital decay for the brown dwarf mass range as a function of the host\nproperties. We find that F-type stars may host massive companions for a\nsignificantly longer time than G-type stars for a given orbital period, which\nmay explain the paucity of G-type hosts for brown dwarfs with orbital period\nless than 5 days. On the other hand, we show that the small radius of early\nM-type stars contributes to orbital decay timescales that are only half those\nof F-type stars, despite their more efficient tidal dissipation and magnetic\nbraking. For fully convective later type M-dwarfs, orbital decay timescales\ncould be orders of magnitude greater than for F-type stars. For orbital periods\ngreater than 10 days, brown dwarf occurrence should largely be unaffected by\ntidal decay, whatever the mass of the host. On closer orbital periods, the\nrapid engulfment of massive companions could explain the lack of G and K-type\nhosts in the sample of known systems with transiting brown dwarfs. However, the\npaucity of M-type hosts can not be an effect of tidal decay alone, but may be\nthe result of a selection effect in the sample and/or the formation mechanism. \n\n"}

Previous studies revealed many, but not all\ninteresting properties of this event. Our goal was to add new understanding of\nboth the early and late-time phases of SN 2013df. Our spectral analysis is\nbased on 6 optical spectra obtained with the 9.2m Hobby-Eberly Telescope during\nthe first month after explosion, complemented by a near-infrared spectrum. We\napplied the SYNAPPS spectral synthesis code to constrain the chemical\ncomposition and physical properties of the ejecta. A principal result is the\nidentification of \"high-velocity\" He I lines in the early spectra of SN 2013df,\nmanifest as the blue component of the double-troughed profile at ~5650 A. This\nfinding, together with the lack of clear separation of H and He lines in\nvelocity space, indicates that both H and He features form at the outer\nenvelope during the early phases. We also obtained ground-based BVRI and\ng'r'i'z' photometric data up to +45 days and unfiltered measurements with the\nROTSE-IIIb telescope up to +168 days. From the modelling of the early-time\nquasi-bolometric light curve, we find $M_{ej} \\sim 3.2-4.6 M_{\\odot}$ and\n$E_{kin} \\sim 2.6-2.8 \\times 10^{51}$ erg for the initial ejecta mass and the\ninitial kinetic energy, respectively, which agree well with the values derived\nfrom the separate modelling of the light-curve tail.

Abstract: Astrometry covers a parameter space that cannot be reached by RV or transit\nmethods to detect terrestrial planets on wide orbits. In addition, high\naccuracy astrometric measurements are necessary to measure the inclination of\nthe planet's orbits. Here we investigate the principles of an artefact of the\nastrometric approach. Namely, the displacement of the photo-centre due to\ninhomogeneities in a dust disc around the parent star. Indeed, theory and\nobservations show that circumstellar discs can present strong asymmetries. We\nmodel the pseudo-astrometric signal caused by these inhomogeneities, asking\nwhether a dust clump in a disc can mimic the astrometric signal of an\nEarth-like planet. We show that these inhomogeneities cannot be neglected when\nusing astrometry to find terrestrial planets. We provide the parameter space\nfor which these inhomogeneities can affect the astrometric signals but still\nnot be detected by mid-IR observations. We find that a small cross section of\ndust corresponding to a cometary mass object is enough to mimic the astrometric\nsignal of an Earth-like planet. Astrometric observations of protoplanetary\ndiscs to search for planets can also be affected by the presence of\ninhomogeneities. Some further tests are given to confirm whether an observation\nis a real planet astrometric signal or an impostor. Eventually, we also study\nthe case where the cross section of dust is high enough to provide a detectable\nIR-excess and to have a measurable photometric displacement by actual\ninstruments such as Gaia, IRAC or GRAVITY. We suggest a new method, which\nconsists in using astrometry to quantify asymmetries (clumpiness) in inner\ndebris discs that cannot be otherwise resolved. \n\n"}

We used these new\nphotometric and spectroscopic data to refine the orbital and physical\nproperties of this planetary system, finding that the stellar and planetary\nmass measurements are significantly larger than those in the discovery paper.\nIn addition, the multi-band light curves were used to construct an optical\ntransmission spectrum of WASP-98b and probe the characteristics of its\natmosphere at the terminator.

However, self-scattering by\nlarge dust grains with a high enough albedo is another polarization mechanism,\nbecoming a compelling method independent of the spectral index to constrain the\ndust grain size in protoplanetary disks. We study the dust polarization at mm\nwavelength in the dust trapping scenario proposed for transition disks, when a\ngiant planet opens a gap in the disk. We investigate the characteristic\npolarization patterns and their dependence on disk inclination, dust size\nevolution, planet position, and observing wavelength. We combine\ntwo-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of planet-disk interactions with\nself-consistent dust growth models. These size-dependent dust density\ndistributions are used for follow-up three-dimensional radiative transfer\ncalculations to predict the polarization degree at ALMA bands due to scattered\nthermal emission. We find that the polarization pattern of a disk with a\nplanetary gap after 1 Myr of dust evolution shows a distinctive three ring\nstructure. Two narrow inner rings are located at the planet gap edges. For\nincreasing observing wavelengths all three rings slightly change their\nposition, where the innermost and outermost rings move inward. This distance is\ndetectable comparing the results at ALMA bands 3, 6 and 7. Within the highest\npolarized intensity regions the polarization vectors are oriented in the\nazimuthal direction. For an inclined disk there is an interplay between\npolarization originating from a flux gradient and inclination-induced\nquadrupole polarization. For intermediate inclined transition disks the\npolarization degree is as high as ~ 2% at band 3, which is well above the\ndetection limit of future ALMA observations. \n\n"}

This spiral wave instability (SWI)\narises from a resonant interaction between pairs of inertial waves, or\ninertial-gravity waves, and the background spiral wave. The development of the\ninstability in the linear regime involves the growth of a broad spectrum of\ninertial modes, with growth rates on the order of the orbital time, and results\nin a nonlinear saturated state in which turbulent velocity perturbations are of\na similar magnitude to those induced by the spiral wave. The turbulence induces\nangular momentum transport, and vertical mixing, at a rate that depends locally\non the amplitude of the spiral wave (we obtain a stress parameter $\\alpha \\sim\n5 \\times 10^{-4}$ in our reference model). The instability is found to operate\nin a wide-range of disk models, including those with isothermal or adiabatic\nequations of state, and in viscous disks where the dimensionless kinematic\nviscosity $\\nu\\le 10^{-5}$. This robustness suggests that the instability will\nhave applications to a broad range of astrophysical disk-related phenomena,\nincluding those in close binary systems, planets embedded in protoplanetary\ndisks (including Jupiter in our own Solar System) and FU Orionis outburst\nmodels.

Abstract: Several studies have shown that the occultation of stellar active regions by\nthe transiting planet can generate anomalies in the high-precision transit\nlight curves, and these anomalies may lead to an inaccurate estimate of the\nplanetary parameters (e.g., the planet radius). Since the physics and geometry\nbehind the transit light curve and the Rossiter- McLaughlin effect\n(spectroscopic transit) are the same, the Rossiter-McLaughlin observations are\nexpected to be affected by the occultation of stellar active regions in a\nsimilar way. In this paper we perform a fundamental test on the spin-orbit\nangles as derived by Rossiter-McLaughlin measurements, and we examine the\nimpact of the occultation of stellar active regions by the transiting planet on\nthe spin-orbit angle estimations. Our results show that the inaccurate\nestimation on the spin-orbit angle due to stellar activity can be quite\nsignificant (up to 30 degrees), particularly for the edge-on, aligned, and\nsmall transiting planets. Therefore, our results suggest that the aligned\ntransiting planets are the ones that can be easily misinterpreted as misaligned\nowing to the stellar activity. In other words, the biases introduced by\nignoring stellar activity are unlikely to be the culprit for the highly\nmisaligned systems. \n\n"}

By comparing the relative occurrences of multiple to\nsingle-transiting systems, recent analyses have revealed a significant\nover-abundance of singles. Dubbed the \"Kepler Dichotomy,\" this feature has been\ninterpreted as evidence for two separate populations of planetary systems: one\nwhere all orbits are confined to a single plane, and a second where the\nconstituent planetary orbits possess significant mutual inclinations, allowing\nonly a single member to be observed in transit at a given epoch. In this work,\nwe demonstrate that stellar obliquity, excited within the disk-hosting stage,\ncan explain this dichotomy. Young stars rotate rapidly, generating a\nsignificant quadrupole moment which torques the planetary orbits, with inner\nplanets influenced more strongly. Given nominal parameters, this torque is\nsufficiently strong to excite significant mutual inclinations between planets,\nenhancing the number of single-transiting planets, sometimes through a\ndynamical instability. Furthermore, as hot stars appear to possess\nsystematically higher obliquities, we predict that single-transiting systems\nshould be relatively more prevalent around more massive stars.

The trajectory is of such nature that,\nwithout being gravitationally attached, the value of the angular separation\nbetween host and quasi-satellite as seen from the Sun remains confined within\nrelatively narrow limits for time-spans that exceed the length of the host's\nsidereal orbital period.

The analemmatic curve\n(figure-eight-, teardrop-, ellipse-shaped) results from the interplay between\nthe tilt of the rotational axis of the host and the properties of the orbit of\nthe quasi-satellite.

Historical UV observations have ruled out orbital variability as an\nexplanation for flickering and instead suggest flickering is caused by variable\nmass transfer.

In particular, the Hansa and\nGallia family are crossed by the $s-s_V$ resonance with Vesta, that\nsignificantly alters the inclination of some of their members.\n  In this work we use the time evolution of ${\\gamma}_2(v_W)$ for simulated\nfamilies under the gravitational influence of all planets and the three most\nmassive bodies in the main belt to assess the dynamical importance (or lack of)\nnode secular resonances with Ceres, Vesta, and Pallas for the considered\nfamilies, and to obtain independent constraints on the family ages. While\nsecular resonances with massive bodies in the main belt do not significantly\naffect the dynamical evolution of the Barcelona family, they significantly\nincrease the ${\\gamma}_2(v_W)$ values of the simulated Hansa and Gallia\nfamilies. Current values of the ${\\gamma}_2(v_W)$ for the Gallia family are\nreached over the estimated family age only if secular resonances with Vesta are\naccounted for. \n\n"}

Saturn's rings are\nmassive and made of 90-95% of water ice. In contrast, the much less massive\nrings of Uranus and Neptune are dark and likely to have higher rock fraction.\nHere we investigate, for the first time, the tidal disruption of a passing\nobject, including the subsequent formation of planetary rings. First, we\nperform SPH simulations of the tidal destruction of big differentiated objects\n($M_{\\rm body}=10^{21-23}$) that experience close encounters with Saturn or\nUranus. We find that about $0.1-10$% of the mass of the passing body is\ngravitationally captured around the planet. However, these fragments are\ninitially big chunks and have highly eccentric orbits around the planet. Then,\nwe perform N-body simulations including the planet's oblateness, starting with\ndata obtained from the SPH simulations. Our N-body simulations show that the\nchunks are tidally destroyed during their next several orbits. Their individual\norbits then start to precess incoherently around the planet's equator, which\nenhances their encounter velocities on longer-term evolution, resulting in more\ndestructive impacts. These collisions would damp their eccentricities resulting\nin a progressive collapse of the debris cloud into a thin equatorial and\nlow-eccentricity ring. These high energy impacts are expected to be\ncatastrophic enough to produce small particles. Our numerical results also show\nthat the mass of formed rings is large enough to explain current rings\nincluding inner regular satellites around Saturn and Uranus. In the case of\nUranus, a body can go deeper inside the planet's Roche limit resulting in a\nmore efficient capture of rocky material compared to Saturn's case in which\nmostly ice is captured. Thus, our results can naturally explain the\ncompositional difference between the rings of Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. \n\n"}

Abstract: While most of the known debris discs present cold dust at tens of AU, a few\nyoung systems exhibit hot dust analogous to the Zodiacal dust. $\\eta$ Corvi is\nparticularly interesting as it is old and it has both, with its hot dust\nsignificantly exceeding the maximum luminosity of an in-situ collisional\ncascade. Previous work suggested that this system could be undergoing an event\nsimilar to the Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB) soon after or during a dynamical\ninstability. Here we present ALMA observations of $\\eta$ Corvi with a\nresolution of 1.\"2 (~22au) to study its outer belt. The continuum emission is\nconsistent with an axisymmetric belt, with a mean radius of 152au and radial\nFWHM of 46au, which is too narrow compared to models of inward scattering of an\nLHB-like scenario. Instead, the hot dust could be explained as material passed\ninwards in a rather stable planetary configuration. We also report a 4sigma\ndetection of CO at ~ 20au. CO could be released in situ from icy planetesimals\nbeing passed in when crossing the H$_2$O or CO$_2$ ice lines. Finally, we place\nconstraints on hidden planets in the disc. If a planet is sculpting the disc's\ninner edge, this should be orbiting at 75-100au, with a mass of 3-30 M$_\\oplus$\nand an eccentricity < 0.08. Such a planet would be able to clear its chaotic\nzone on a timescale shorter than the age of the system and scatter material\ninwards from the outer belt to the inner regions, thus feeding the hot dust. \n\n"}

Oxygen abundance in the metal-poor giant HD 122563 from OH UV lines Abstract: Although oxygen is an important tracer of the early Galactic evolution, its\nabundance trends with metallicity are still relatively poorly known at [Fe/H] <\n-2.5. This is in part due to a lack of reliable oxygen abundance indicators in\nthe metal-poor stars, in part due to shortcomings in 1D LTE abundance analyses.\nIn this study we determined the oxygen abundance in the metal-poor halo giant\nHD 122563 using a 3D hydrodynamical CO5BOLD model atmosphere. Our main goal was\nto understand whether a 3D LTE analysis may help to improve the reliability of\noxygen abundances determined from OH UV lines in comparison to those obtained\nusing standard 1D LTE methodology. The oxygen abundance in HD 122563 was\ndetermined using 71 OH UV lines located in the wavelength range between 308-330\nnm. The analysis was done using a high-resolution VLT UVES spectrum with a 1D\nLTE spectral line synthesis performed using the SYNTHE package and classical\nATLAS9 model atmosphere. Subsequently, a 3D hydrodynamical CO5BOLD, and 1D\nhydrostatic LHD model atmospheres were used in order to compute 3D-1D abundance\ncorrections. For this, the microturbulence velocity used with the 1D LHD model\natmosphere was derived from the hydrodynamical CO5BOLD model atmosphere. As in\nprevious studies, we found trends of the 1D LTE oxygen abundances determined\nfrom OH UV lines with line parameters, such as the line excitation potential\nand the line strength. These trends become significantly less pronounced in 3D\nLTE. Using OH UV lines we determined a 3D LTE oxygen abundance in HD 122563 of\nA(O) = 6.23 +/- 0.13. This is in fair agreement with the oxygen abundance\nobtained from OH IR lines, A(O) = 6.39 +/- 0.11, but it is noticeably lower\nthan that determined using the forbidden [OI] line, A(O) = 6.53 +/- 0.15.

Abstract: Photometry of short-period planetary systems allows astronomers to monitor\nexoplanets, their host stars, and their mutual interactions. In addition to the\ntransits of a planet in front of its star and the eclipses of the planet by its\nstar, researchers have reported flux variations at the orbital frequency and\nits harmonics: planetary reflection and/or emission and Doppler beaming of\nstarlight produce one peak per orbit, while ellipsoidal variations of a tidally\ndistorted star and/or planet produce two maxima per orbit. Researchers have\nalso reported significant photometric variability at three times the orbital\nfrequency, sometimes much greater than the predictions of tidal theory. The\nreflected phase variations of a homogeneous planet contains power at even\norbital harmonics-important for studies of ellipsoidal variations-but cannot\ncontain odd orbital harmonics. We show that odd harmonics can, however, be\nproduced by an edge-on planet with a time-variable map, or an inclined planet\nwith a North-South (N-S) asymmetric map. Either of these scenarios entail\nweather: short-period planets are expected to have zero obliquity and hence N-S\nsymmetric stellar forcing. North-South asymmetry in a giant planet would\ntherefore suggest stochastic localized features, such as weather. However, we\nfind that previous claims of large-amplitude odd modes in Kepler photometry are\nartifacts of removing planetary transits rather than modeling them. The only\nreliable claims of odd harmonics remain HAT-P-7b and Kepler-13Ab, for which the\nthird mode amplitude is 6-8% of the planetary flux. Although time-variable\nalbedo maps could in principle explain these odd harmonics, upper-limits on the\ninfrared variability of hot Jupiters make this hypothesis unlikely.

In disks around Herbig Ae stars ($T_{\\mathrm{*}}\\sim$\n10,000K, $M_{\\mathrm{*}}\\gtrsim$ 2.5$M_{\\bigodot}$), the position of the\nH$_{2}$O snowline is further from the central star compared with that around\ncooler, and less massive T Tauri stars. Thus, the H$_{2}$O emission line fluxes\nfrom the region within the H$_{2}$O snowline are expected to be stronger. In\nthis paper, we calculate the chemical composition of a Herbig Ae disk using\nchemical kinetics. Next, we calculate the H$_{2}$O emission line profiles, and\ninvestigate the properties of candidate water lines across a wide range of\nwavelengths (from mid-infrared to sub-millimeter) that can locate the position\nof the H$_{2}$O snowline.

For WASP-13, observations have shown that\nthe apparent lack of activity is possibly caused by absorption from the\nintervening ISM. Inspired by this result, we study the effect of ISM absorption\non activity measurements (S and logR'$_{\\rm HK}$ indices) for main-sequence\nlate-type stars. To this end, we employ synthetic stellar photospheric spectra\ncombined with varying amounts of chromospheric emission and ISM absorption. We\npresent the effect of ISM absorption on activity measurements by varying\nseveral instrumental, stellar, and ISM parameters. We find that for relative\nvelocities between the stellar and ISM lines smaller than 30-40 km/s and for\nISM CaII column densities logN$_{\\rm CaII}$>12, the ISM absorption has a\nsignificant influence on activity measurements. Direct measurements and three\ndimensional maps of the Galactic ISM absorption indicate that an ISM CaII\ncolumn density of logN$_{\\rm CaII}$=12 is typically reached by a distance of\nabout 100 pc along most sight lines.

For Archean-like atmospheres, planets orbiting\nstars with the highest UV fluxes do not form haze due to the formation of\nphotochemical oxygen radicals that destroy haze precursors.

The ram pressure exerted\nby the flow can truncate the disc and the accretion of material with no\nazimuthal angular momentum leads to further disc contraction. We derive a\ntheoretical model from accretion disc theory that describes the evolution of\nthe disc radius, mass, and surface density profile as a function of the density\nand velocity of the ambient medium. We test our model by performing\nhydrodynamical simulations of a protoplanetary disc embedded in a flow with\ndifferent velocities and densities. We find that our model gives an adequate\ndescription of the evolution of the disc radius and accretion rate onto the\ndisc. The total disc mass in the simulations follows the theoretically expected\ntrend, except at the lowest density where our simulated discs lose mass owing\nto continuous stripping. This stripping may be a numerical rather than a\nphysical effect. Some quantitative differences exist between the model\npredictions and the simulations. These are at least partly caused by numerical\nviscous effects in the disc and depend on the resolution of the simulation. Our\nmodel can be used as a conservative estimate for the process of face-on\naccretion onto protoplanetary discs, as long as viscous processes in the disc\ncan be neglected.

In particular, we focus on the\ntidal response of a rotating fluid body to the obliquity tide, which may be\nimportant for the evolution of the spin-orbit angle but hardly affects the\norbital evolution.

Gaussian Processes are a popular class of models used for this\npurpose but, since the computational cost scales, in general, as the cube of\nthe number of data points, their application has been limited to small\ndatasets. In this paper, we present a novel method for Gaussian Process\nmodeling in one-dimension where the computational requirements scale linearly\nwith the size of the dataset. We demonstrate the method by applying it to\nsimulated and real astronomical time series datasets. These demonstrations are\nexamples of probabilistic inference of stellar rotation periods, asteroseismic\noscillation spectra, and transiting planet parameters. The method exploits\nstructure in the problem when the covariance function is expressed as a mixture\nof complex exponentials, without requiring evenly spaced observations or\nuniform noise. This form of covariance arises naturally when the process is a\nmixture of stochastically-driven damped harmonic oscillators -- providing a\nphysical motivation for and interpretation of this choice -- but we also\ndemonstrate that it can be a useful effective model in some other cases.

Our work yields the largest sample of\nsystems with a transiting giant exoplanet and coherently determined orbital,\nplanetary, and stellar parameters. We found that the orbital parameters of TGPs\nin non-compact planetary systems are clearly shaped by tides raised by their\nhost stars. Indeed, the most eccentric planets have relatively large orbital\nseparations and/or high mass ratios, as expected from the equilibrium tide\ntheory. This feature would be the outcome of high-eccentricity migration (HEM).\nThe distribution of $\\alpha=a/a_R$, where $a$ and $a_R$ are the semi-major axis\nand the Roche limit, for well-determined circular orbits peaks at 2.5; this\nalso agrees with expectations from the HEM. The few planets of our sample with\ncircular orbits and $\\alpha >5$ values may have migrated through disc-planet\ninteractions instead of HEM.

In the Kepler-448\nsystem, the mutual inclination is weakly constrained and such an eccentricity\noscillation is possible for a fraction of the solutions. Thus these WJs may be\nundergoing tidal migration to become hot Jupiters (HJs), although the migration\nvia this process from beyond the snow line is disfavored by the close-in and\nmassive nature of the companions.

While in this state, appreciable angular momentum can\nbe transported. Alternatively, the gas may collapse into bound clumps, the\nprogenitors of planets or stars. In this paper, we numerically characterize the\nproperties of 3D gravitoturbulence, focussing especially on its dependence on\nnumerical parameters (resolution, domain size) and its excitation of\nsmall-scale dynamics. Via a survey of vertically stratified shearing box\nsimulations with PLUTO and RODEO, we find (a) evidence that certain\ngravitoturbulent properties are independent of horizontal box size only when\nthe box is larger than $\\simeq 40 H_0$, where $H_0$ is the height scale, (b) at\nhigh resolution, small-scale isotropic turbulence appears off the midplane\naround $z\\simeq 0.5 -1 H_0$, and (c) this small-scale dynamics results from a\nparametric instability, involving the coupling of inertial waves with a\nlarge-scale axisymmetric epicyclic mode.

Several processes are thought to\nbe responsible for this disc dispersal. Here we compare two of these processes:\ndynamical encounters and interaction with the interstellar medium, which\nincludes face-on accretion and ram pressure stripping. We perform simulations\nof embedded star clusters with parameterisations for both processes to\ndetermine the environment in which either of these processes is dominant.

We present a mechanism\nthat causes such a spin-orbit misalignment for a protoplanetary disc due to its\nmovement through an ambient medium. Our physical explanation of the mechanism\nis based on the theoretical solutions to the Stark problem. We test this idea\nby performing self-consistent hydrodynamical simulations and simplified\ngravitational $N$-body simulations. The $N$-body model reduces the mechanism to\nthe relevant physical processes. The hydrodynamical simulations show the\nmechanism in its full extent, including gas-dynamical and viscous processes in\nthe disc which are not included in the theoretical framework. We find that a\nprotoplanetary disc embedded in a flow changes its orientation as its angular\nmomentum vector tends to align parallel to the relative velocity vector. Due to\nthe force exerted by the flow, orbits in the disc become eccentric, which\nproduces a net torque and consequentially changes the orbital inclination. The\ntilting of the disc causes it to contract. Apart from becoming lopsided, the\ngaseous disc also forms a spiral arm even if the inclination does not change\nsubstantially. The process is most effective at high velocities and\nobservational signatures are therefore mostly expected in massive star-forming\nregions and around winds or supernova ejecta.

Abstract: The formation of planets strongly depends on the total amount as well as on\nthe spatial distribution of solids in protoplanetary disks. Thanks to the\nimprovements in resolution and sensitivity provided by ALMA, measurements of\nthe surface density of mm-sized grains are now possible on large samples of\ndisks. Such measurements provide statistical constraints that can be used to\ninform our understanding of the initial conditions of planet formation. We\nanalyze spatially resolved observations of 36 protoplanetary disks in the Lupus\nstar forming complex from our ALMA survey at 890 micron, aiming to determine\nphysical properties such as the dust surface density, the disk mass and size\nand to provide a constraint on the temperature profile. We fit the observations\ndirectly in the uv-plane using a two-layer disk model that computes the 890\nmicron emission by solving the energy balance at each disk radius. For 22 out\nof 36 protoplanetary disks we derive robust estimates of their physical\nproperties. The sample covers stellar masses between ~0.1 and ~2 Solar masses,\nand we find no trend between the average disk temperatures and the stellar\nparameters. We find, instead, a correlation between the integrated sub-mm flux\n(a proxy for the disk mass) and the exponential cut-off radii (a proxy of the\ndisk size) of the Lupus disks. Comparing these results with observations at\nsimilar angular resolution of Taurus-Auriga/Ophiuchus disks found in literature\nand scaling them to the same distance, we observe that the Lupus disks are\ngenerally fainter and larger at a high level of statistical significance.\nConsidering the 1-2 Myr age difference between these regions, it is possible to\ntentatively explain the offset in the disk mass/disk size relation with viscous\nspreading, however with the current measurements other mechanisms cannot be\nruled out. \n\n"}

So far it has not been possible to infer the occurrence frequency of\nstellar CMEs from observations. Based on their close relation with flares on\nthe Sun, we develop an empirical model combining solar flare-CME relationships\nwith stellar flare rates to estimate the CME activity of young Sun-like and\nlate-type main-sequence stars.

Previous\nthree-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamical simulations indicate that atmospheres of\nlow-mass planets cannot be considered isolated from the protoplanetary disc,\ncontrary to what is assumed in 1D-evolutionary calculations. This finding is\nreferred to as the recycling hypothesis. In this Paper we investigate the\nrecycling hypothesis for super-Earth planets, accounting for realistic 3D\nradiation hydrodynamics. Also, we conduct a direct comparison in terms of the\nevolution of the entropy between 1D and 3D geometries. We clearly see that 3D\natmospheres maintain higher entropy: although gas in the atmosphere loses\nentropy through radiative cooling, the advection of high entropy gas from the\ndisc into the Bondi/Hill sphere slows down Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction,\npotentially arresting envelope growth at a sub-critical gas mass fraction.\nRecycling, therefore, operates vigorously, in line with results by previous\nstudies. However, we also identify an \"inner core\" -- in size $\\approx$ 25% of\nthe Bondi radius -- where streamlines are more circular and entropies are much\nlower than in the outer atmosphere. Future studies at higher resolutions are\nneeded to assess whether this region can become hydrodynamically-isolated on\nlong time-scales. \n\n"}

We consider a model of orbital\ncircularization for the core of a giant planet after it is scattered from an\ninner disk region by a more massive planet, which was proposed by Kikuchi et al\n(2014). We extend their model for single star systems to binary (multiple) star\nsystems, by taking into account tidal truncation of the protoplanetary gas disk\nby a binary companion. As an example, we consider a wide-orbit gas giant in a\nhierarchical triple system, HD131399Ab. The best-fit orbit of the planet is\nthat with semimajor axis $\\sim 80$ au and eccentricity $\\sim 0.35$.

Here we investigate,\nfirstly, whether there is a correlation between the size of starspots - assumed\nto be related to the amplitude of the sinusoid - and their decay timescale and,\nsecondly, whether any such correlation depends on the stellar effective\ntemperature. To determine this, we computed the autocorrelation functions of\nthe light curves of samples of stars from Kepler and fitted them with apodised\nperiodic functions. The light curve amplitudes, representing spot size were\nmeasured from the root-mean-squared scatter of the normalised light curves. We\nused a Monte Carlo Markov Chain to measure the periods and decay timescales of\nthe light curves. The results show a correlation between the decay time of\nstarspots and their inferred size. The decay time also depends strongly on the\ntemperature of the star. Cooler stars have spots that last much longer, in\nparticular for stars with longer rotational periods. This is consistent with\ncurrent theories of diffusive mechanisms causing starspot decay. We also find\nthat the Sun is not unusually quiet for its spectral type - stars with\nsolar-type rotation periods and temperatures tend to have (comparatively)\nsmaller starspots than stars with mid-G or later spectral types. \n\n"}

Besides using the angular momentum of the 15 solar-mass model\nas obtained in the stellar evolution calculation with an angular frequency of\nabout 0.001 rad/s (spin period of more than 6000 s) at the Si/Si-O interface,\nwe also computed 2D and 3D cases with no rotation and with a ~300 times shorter\nrotation period and different angular resolutions. In 2D, only the nonrotating\nand slowly rotating models explode, while rapid rotation prevents an explosion\nwithin 500 ms after bounce because of lower radiated neutrino luminosities and\nmean energies and thus reduced neutrino heating. In contrast, only the fast\nrotating model develops an explosion in 3D when the Si/Si-O interface collapses\nthrough the shock.

Despite much theoretical/numerical and experimental\nefforts over the last decades, its saturation mechanism and amplitude, which\nsets the angular momentum transport rate, remains not well understood,\nespecially in the limit of high resistivity, or small magnetic Prandtl numbers\ntypical to interiors (dead zones) of protoplanetary disks, liquid cores of\nplanets and liquid metals in laboratory.

For simplicity, the ratio of azimuthal field to axial field is\nkept fixed. From the linear theory of HMRI, it is known that the Elsasser\nnumber, or interaction parameter determines its growth rate and plays a special\nrole in the dynamics. We show that this parameter is also important in the\nnonlinear problem. By increasing its value, a sudden transition from weakly\nnonlinear, where the system is slightly above the linear stability threshold,\nto strongly nonlinear, or turbulent regime occurs. We calculate the azimuthal\nand axial energy spectra corresponding to these two regimes and show that they\ndiffer qualitatively. Remarkably, the nonlinear state remains in all cases\nnearly axisymmetric suggesting that HMRI turbulence is quasi two-dimensional in\nnature.

Such observations can be challenging for long period planets, where\nthe transits may last for over a day. Planetary rings will also impact the\nshape of absorption lines in the stellar spectrum, as the planet and rings\ncover different parts of the rotating star (the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect).\nThese line-profile distortions depend on the size, structure, opacity,\nobliquity and sky projected angle of the ring system. For slow rotating stars,\nthis mainly impacts the amplitude of the induced velocity shift, however, for\nfast rotating stars the large velocity gradient across the star allows the line\ndistortion to be resolved, enabling direct determination of the ring\nparameters.

Previous work has shown that II-P and\nII-L supernovae (SNe) have Red Supergiant (RSG) progenitors, and that the range\nof initial masses for these progenitors seems to be limited to $<$17M$_\\odot$.\nThis is in contrast with the cutoff of 25-30M$_\\odot$ predicted by evolutionary\nmodels, a result which is termed the 'Red Supergiant Problem'.

We show, using star clusters, that RSGs evolve to later spectral\ntypes as they approach SN, which in turn causes the BC to become larger.\nFailure to account for this results in a systematic underestimate of a star's\nluminosity, and hence its initial mass. Using our empirically motivated BCs we\nreappraise the II-P and II-L SNe that have their progenitors detected in\npre-explosion imaging.

We apply linear theory to show\nboth analytically and numerically that a nearly polar aligned low mass\ncircumbinary disc evolves to polar alignment and determine the alignment\ntimescale. Significant disc evolution towards the polar state around moderately\neccentric binaries can occur for typical protostellar disc parameters in less\nthan a typical disc lifetime for binaries with orbital periods of order 100\nyears or less. Resonant torques are much less effective at truncating the inner\nparts of circumbinary polar discs than the inner parts of coplanar discs. For\npolar discs, they vanish for a binary eccentricity of unity. The results agree\nwith the simulations in showing that discs can evolve to a polar state.\nCircumbinary planets may then form in such discs and reside on polar orbits. \n\n"}

These observations\ncan provide complementary information on the mechanism carving the gaps in dust\nand additional constraints on the purported planet mass.

The ratio between the\nlocation of the gap as seen in CO and the peak in the mm continuum at the\npressure maximum outside the orbit of the planet shows a clear dependence on\nplanet mass. Due to the low dust density in the gaps, the dust and gas\ncomponents can become thermally decoupled, with the gas being colder than the\ndust. The gaps seen in CO are due to a combination of gas temperature dropping\nat the location of the planet, and of the underlying surface density profile.\nIn none of the models is a CO cavity observed, only CO gaps, indicating that\none single massive planet is not able to explain the CO cavities observed in\ntransition disks. \n\n"}

Since observed\nsuper-Earths are in the range of critical mass, they would accrete gas\nefficiently and become gas giants. Theoretically, super-Earths are predicted to\nbe rare in the core-accretion framework. To resolve this contradiction, we\npropose that the tidally-forced turbulent diffusion may affect the heat\ntransport inside the planet. Thermal feedback induced by turbulent diffusion is\ninvestigated. We find that the tidally-forced turbulence would generate\npseudo-adiabatic regions within radiative zones, which pushes the\nradiative-convective boundaries (RCBs) inwards. This would decrease the cooling\nluminosity and enhance the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) timescale. For a given\nlifetime of protoplanetary disks (PPDs), there exists a critical threshold for\nthe turbulent diffusivity, $\\nu_{\\rm critical}$. If $\\nu_{\\rm turb}>\\nu_{\\rm\ncritical} $, the KH timescale is longer than the disk lifetime and the planet\nwould become a super-Earth rather than a gas giant.

Formation\n  mechanism Abstract: Protoplanetary disk simulations show that a single planet can excite more\nthan one spiral arm, possibly explaining recent observations of multiple spiral\narms in some systems. In this paper, we explain the mechanism by which a planet\nexcites multiple spiral arms in a protoplanetary disk. Contrary to previous\nspeculations, the formation of both primary and additional arms can be\nunderstood as a linear process when the planet mass is sufficiently small. A\nplanet resonantly interacts with epicyclic oscillations in the disk, launching\nspiral wave modes around the Lindblad resonances. When a set of wave modes is\nin phase, they can constructively interfere with each other and create a spiral\narm. More than one spiral arm can form because such constructive interference\ncan occur for different sets of wave modes, with the exact number and launching\nposition of spiral arms dependent on the planet mass as well as the disk\ntemperature profile. Non-linear effects become increasingly important as the\nplanet mass increases, resulting in spiral arms with stronger shocks and thus\nlarger pitch angles. This is found in common for both primary and additional\narms. When a planet has a sufficiently large mass ($\\gtrsim$ 3 thermal masses\nfor $(h/r)_p=0.1$), only two spiral arms form interior to its orbit. The wave\nmodes that would form a tertiary arm for smaller mass planets merge with the\nprimary arm.

The arm-to-arm separations increase as a function of\nplanet mass, consistent with previous studies; however, the exact slope depends\non disk temperature as well as the radial location where the arm-to-arm\nseparations are measured. We apply these diagnostics to the spiral arms seen in\nMWC 758 and Elias 2-27. As shown in Bae et al. (2017), planet-driven spiral\narms can create concentric rings and gaps, which can produce more dominant\nobservable signature than spiral arms under certain circumstances. We discuss\nthe observability of planet-driven spiral arms versus rings and gaps. \n\n"}

By studying the arrival times of the p-mode maxima and\nminima through the O-C method, in a previous article the presence of a planet\nwas inferred with an orbital period of 3.2 yr and a minimum mass of 3.2 M_Jup.\nHere we present an updated O-C analysis using a larger data set of 1066 hours\nof photometric time series (~2.5x larger in terms of the number of data\npoints), which covers the period between 1999 and 2012 (compared with 1999-2006\nof the previous analysis). Up to the end of 2008, the new O-C diagram of the\nmain pulsation frequency (f1) is compatible with (and improves) the previous\ntwo-component solution representing the long-term variation of the pulsation\nperiod (parabolic component) and the giant planet (sine wave component). Since\n2009, the O-C trend of f1 changes, and the time derivative of the pulsation\nperiod (p_dot) passes from positive to negative; the reason of this change of\nregime is not clear and could be related to nonlinear interactions between\ndifferent pulsation modes. With the new data, the O-C diagram of the secondary\npulsation frequency (f2) continues to show two components (parabola and sine\nwave), like in the previous analysis. Various solutions are proposed to fit the\nO-C diagrams of f1 and f2, but in all of them, the sinusoidal components of f1\nand f2 differ or at least agree less well than before. The nice agreement found\npreviously was a coincidence due to various small effects that are carefully\nanalysed.

Thus, the\ndistribution of photo-chemically produced species and aerosols may be limited\nto an 'equatorial transport belt'. In contrast, planets with $P_{orb}>25$~days,\nlike GJ~667~C~f, exhibit efficient thermally driven circulation in the\nstratosphere that allows for a day side-wide distribution of air masses.\n  The influence of the standing tropical Rossby waves on tidally locked\nExoEarths with $P_{orb} \\leq 25$~days can, however, be circumvented with deep\nstratospheric wind breaking alone - allowing for equator-to-pole transport like\non Earth.

To use these intervals\n(called windows) a good knowledge of atmospheric absorption is necessary. Once\ngas spectroscopic linelists are well established, the absorption inside windows\ndepends on the way the far wings of the methane absorption lines are cut-off.\nWe know that the intensity in all the windows can be explained with the same\ncut-off parameters, except for the window at 2 {\\mu}m.

Within our model, for Sun-like stars, we find\nthat: (1)~the duration of habitable surface water is strongly affected by ocean\nchemistry; (2)~possible ocean pH spans a wide range; (3)~surprisingly, many\nwaterworlds retain habitable surface water for >1 Gyr, and (contrary to\nprevious claims) this longevity does not necessarily involve geochemical\ncycling. The key to this cycle-independent planetary habitability is that C\nexchange between the convecting mantle and the water ocean is curtailed by\nseafloor pressure on waterworlds, so the planet is stuck with the ocean mass\nand ocean cations that it acquires during the first 1% of its history. In our\nmodel, the sum of positive charges leached from the planetary crust by early\nwater-rock interactions is - coincidentally - often within an order of\nmagnitude of the early-acquired atmosphere+ocean inorganic C inventory\noverlaps. As a result, pCO2 is frequently in the \"sweet spot\" (0.2-20 bar) for\nwhich the range of semimajor axis that permits surface liquid water is about as\nwide as it can be.

Here we present high\nspatial resolution 880$\\mu$m continuum images from the Atacama Large Millimeter\nArray. The 80au radius dust ring is resolved radially with a characteristic\nwidth of 10au, consistent with the narrow profile seen in scattered light. Our\nmodelling consistently finds that the disk is also vertically resolved with a\nsimilar extent. However, this extent is less than the beam size, and a disk\nthat is dynamically very cold (i.e. vertically thin) provides a better\ntheoretical explanation for the narrow scattered light profile, so we remain\ncautious about this conclusion.

To understand if this\nconcurrence reflects an underlying geographical and/or temporal pattern, we\nmust aim at predicting the spatio-temporal distribution of meteoroid impacts on\nEarth. For this purpose we designed, implemented and tested a novel numerical\ntechnique, the \"Gravitational Ray Tracing\" (GRT) designed to compute the\nrelative impact probability (RIP) on the surface of any planet. GRT is inspired\nby the so-called ray-casting techniques used to render realistic images of\ncomplex 3D scenes. In this paper we describe the method and the results of\ntesting it at the time of large impact events. Our findings suggest a\nnon-trivial pattern of impact probabilities at any given time on Earth.\nLocations at $60-90\\deg$ from the apex are more prone to impacts, especially at\nmidnight. Counterintuitively, sites close to apex direction have the lowest\nRIP, while in the antapex RIP are slightly larger than average.

The goal is to\nstudy the kinematic and density structure of the SDC13 hub at high angular\nresolution to determine what drives its evolution and fragmentation. We have\nmapped SDC13, a 1000Msun infrared dark hub, in NH3(1,1) and NH3(2,2) emission\nlines, with both the JVLA and GBT down to 0.07pc. The mass-per-unit-lengths of\nall four hub filaments are thermally super-critical, consistent with the\npresence of tens of gravitationally bound cores along them. These cores exhibit\nregular separation of 0.37 +/- 0.16 pc suggesting gravitational instabilities\nrunning along these super-critical filaments are responsible for their\nfragmentation. The observed local increase of the dense gas velocity dispersion\ntowards starless cores is believed to be a consequence of such fragmentation\nprocess. We see velocity gradient peaks towards 63% of the cores as expected\nduring the early stages of filament fragmentation. The most massive cores are\nlocated at the filament junctions, where the velocity dispersion is the\nlargest. We interpret this as the result of the hub morphology generating the\nlargest acceleration gradients near the hub centre. We propose a scenario for\nthe evolution of the SDC13 hub in which filaments first form as post-shock\nstructures in a supersonic turbulent flow. Then gravity takes over and starts\nshaping the evolution of the hub, both fragmenting filaments and pulling the\ngas towards the centre of the gravitational well. By doing so, gravitational\nenergy is converted into kinetic energy in both local (cores) and global (hub\ncentre) potential well minima. Furthermore, the generation of larger\ngravitational acceleration gradients at the filament junctions promotes the\nformation of more massive cores. [abridged] \n\n"}

In agreement with\nprevious work, we find that the permeability of the gap depends both on dust\ndynamical properties and the gas disk structure: while small dust follows the\nviscously accreting gas through the gap, dust grains approaching a critical\nsize are progressively filtered out. Moreover, we introduce and compute a\ndepletion factor that enables us to quantify the way in which higher viscosity,\nsmaller planet mass, or a more massive disk can shift this critical size to\nlarger values.

We find Kozai-Lidov mechanism plays the\nmost important role in producing hot Jupiters among these mechanisms. Secular\nchaos is not the usual channel for the formation of hot Jupiters due to the\nlack of angular momentum deficit within 10^7 Tin (periods of the inner orbit).\nAccording to comparisons between the observations and simulations, we speculate\nthat there are at least two populations of hot Jupiters.

We\nexamine this issue using 1D stellar models constructed using Modules for\nExperiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA). First, we consider standard models\nthat do not explicitly include rotational/magnetic effects, with convective\ninhibition modeled by decreasing a depth-independent mixing length theory (MLT)\nparameter $\\alpha_{\\text{MLT}}$ (following Cox et al. 1981; Chabrier et al.\n2007). We provide formulae linking changes in $\\alpha_{\\text{MLT}}$ to changes\nin the interior specific entropy, and hence to the stellar radius. Next, we\nmodify the MLT formulation in MESA to mimic explicitly the influence of\nrotation and magnetism, using formulations suggested by Stevenson (1979) and\nMacDonald & Mullan (2014) respectively. We find rapid rotation in these models\nhas a negligible impact on stellar structure, primarily because a star's\nadiabat, and hence its radius, is predominantly affected by layers near the\nsurface; convection is rapid and largely uninfluenced by rotation there.\nMagnetic fields, if they influenced convective transport in the manner\ndescribed by MacDonald & Mullan (2014), could lead to more noticeable radius\ninflation. Finally, we show that these non-standard effects on stellar\nstructure can be fabricated using a depth-dependent $\\alpha_{\\text{MLT}}$: a\nnon-magnetic, non-rotating model can be produced that is virtually\nindistinguishable from one that explicitly parameterizes rotation and/or\nmagnetism using the two formulations above.

First of all, we confirm that the\nRGD theory breaks down when multiple scattering is important. In addition, we\nfind that both EMT and DHS fail to reproduce the optical properties of dust\naggregates with fractal dimension of 2 when the incident wavelength is shorter\nthan the aggregate radius. In order to solve these problems, we test the mean\nfield theory (MFT), where multiple scattering can be taken into account.

One of the observable\ntests for migration theories is the current value of the angle between the\nstellar equatorial plane and the orbital plane, called the obliquity. After the\nmain migration mechanism has ended, the obliquity and the semi-major axis keep\non evolving due to the combined effects of tides and magnetic braking. The\nobserved correlation between effective temperature and measured projected\nobliquity in known short-period systems has been taken as evidence of such\nmechanisms being at play. Our aim is to produce an improved model for the tidal\nevolution of the obliquity, including all the components of the dynamical tide\nfor circular misaligned systems. This model takes into account the strong\nvariations in structure and rotation of stars during their evolution, and their\nconsequences for the efficiency of tidal dissipation. We use an analytical\nformulation for the frequency-averaged dissipation in convective layers for\neach mode, depending only on global stellar parameters and rotation. For\ntypical hot-Jupiters orbital configurations, the obliquity is generally damped\non a much shorter timescale than the semi-major axis. The final outcome of\ntidal evolution is also very sensitive to the initial conditions, with\nJupiter-mass planets being either quickly destroyed or brought on more distant\norbit, depending on the initial ratio of planetary orbital momentum to stellar\nspin momentum. However we find that everything else being the same, the\nevolution of the obliquity around low-mass stars with a thin convective zone is\nnot slower than around those with a thicker convective zone. On the contrary,\nwe find that more massive stars, remaining faster rotator throughout their\nmain-sequence, produce more efficient dissipation. \n\n"}

We study how Jupiter-mass\nplanet-seeds (termed protoplanets) evolve in massive, but gravitationally\nstable (Q>1.5), discs using radiative hydrodynamic simulations. We find that\nthe protoplanet initially migrates inwards rapidly, until it opens up a gap in\nthe disc. Thereafter, it either continues to migrate inwards on a much longer\ntimescale or starts migrating outwards. Outward migration occurs when the\nprotoplanet resides within a gap with gravitationally unstable edges, as a high\nfraction of the accreted gas is high angular momentum gas from outside the\nprotoplanet's orbit. The effect of radiative heating from the protoplanet is\ncritical in determining the direction of the migration and the eccentricity of\nthe protoplanet. Gap opening is facilitated by efficient cooling that may not\nbe captured by the commonly used beta-cooling approximation. The protoplanet\ninitially accretes at a high rate (1e-3Mj/yr), and its accretion luminosity\ncould be a few tenths of the host star's luminosity, making the protoplanet\neasily observable (albeit only for a short time). Due to the high gas accretion\nrate, the protoplanet generally grows above the deuterium-burning mass-limit.\nProtoplanet radiative feedback reduces its mass growth so that its final mass\nis near the brown dwarf-planet boundary. The fate of a young planet-seed is\ndiverse and could vary from a gas giant planet on a circular orbit at a few AU\nfrom the central star to a brown dwarf on an eccentric, wide orbit. \n\n"}

As shown in Paper I, a dynamical corotation torque arises due to the\nflow-induced asymmetric distortion of the corotation region and the evolving\nvortensity contrast between the librating horseshoe material and background\ndisc flow. Using simulations of laminar torqued discs containing migrating\nplanets, we demonstrate the existence of the four distinct migration regimes\npredicted in Paper I.

We present theoretical and numerical studies on the outcome of\ncapture into first-order mean motion resonances (MMRs) using a parametrized\nplanet migration model that takes into account nonlinear eccentricity damping\ndue to planet-disk interaction. This parametrization is based on numerical\nhydrodynamical simulations and is more realistic than the simple linear\nparametrization widely used in previous analytic studies. We find that\nnonlinear eccentricity damping can significantly influence the stability and\noutcome of resonance capture. In particular, the equilibrium eccentricity of\nthe planet captured into MMRs become larger, and the captured MMR state tends\nto be more stable compared to the prediction based on the simple migration\nmodel. In addition, when the migration is sufficiently fast or/and the planet\nmass ratio is sufficiently small, we observe a novel phenomenon of eccentricity\novershoot, where the planet's eccentricity becomes very large before settling\ndown to the lower equilibrium value. This can lead to the ejection of the\nsmaller planet if its eccentricity approaches unity during the overshoot.

Due to the spin-down of the host star via\nmagnetic braking, this resonance may be achieved during the star's\nmain-sequence lifetime for a wide range of planet masses and orbital\narchitectures. Obliquity excitation is accompanied by a decrease in mutual\ninclination between the inner planet and perturber, and can thus erase high\ninclinations. For hot Jupiters, the stellar spin axis is strongly coupled to\nthe orbital axis, and obliquity excitation by a giant planet companion requires\na strong perturber, usually located within 1-2 AU. For warm Jupiters, the spin\nand orbital axes are more weakly coupled, and the resonance may be achieved for\ndistant giant planet perturbers (at several to tens of AU). Since warm Jupiters\nhave a high occurrence rate of distant planetary companions with appropriate\nproperties for resonant obliquity excitation, stellar obliquities in warm\nJupiter systems may be common, particularly for warm Jupiters orbiting cool\nstars that have undergone significant spin-down. \n\n"}

Its main goal is to complete\ntheir TTV curves, as the Kepler telescope no longer observes the original\nKepler field. Combining Kepler and new ground-based transit data we improve the\nmodelling of these systems.

This model is coupled with a Markov chain Monte Carlo\nalgorithm, allowing the exploration of the model parameter space. Applied to\nthe Kepler-9 long cadence data, short cadence data and 13 new transit\nobservations collected by KOINet between the years 2014 to 2017, our modelling\nprovides well constrained predictions for the next transits and the system's\nparameters.

The corrections for A(Li) and\n6Li/7Li are computed using grids of 3D NLTE and 1D LTE synthetic lithium line\nprofiles, generated from 3D hydro-dynamical CO5BOLD and 1D hydrostatic model\natmospheres, respectively. The 3D NLTE corrections are then approximated by\nanalytical expressions as a function of the stellar parameters. These are\napplied to adjust the 1D LTE isotopic lithium abundances in two solar-type\nstars, HD 207129 and HD 95456. The derived 3D NLTE corrections range between\n-0.01 and +0.11 dex for A(Li), and between -4.9 and -0.4% for the 6Li/7Li\nratio, depending on the adopted stellar parameters. In the case of the 6Li/7Li\nratio, our corrections are always negative, showing that 1D LTE analysis can\nsignificantly overestimate (up to 4.9 percentage points) the presence of 6Li in\nthe atmospheres of solar-like dwarf stars.

Giant planets open gaps in their protoplanetary and subsequently\nsuffer so-called type II migration. Schematically, planets are thought to be\ntightly locked within their surrounding disks, and forced to follow the viscous\nadvection of gas onto the central star. This fundamental principle however has\nrecently been questioned, as migrating planets were shown to decouple from the\ngas' radial drift. Aims. In this framework, we question whether the\ntraditionally used linear scaling of migration rate of a giant planet with the\ndisk's viscosity still holds. Additionally, we assess the role of\norbit-crossing material as part of the decoupling mechanism. Methods. We have\nperformed 2D (r, {\\theta}) numerical simulations of point-mass planets embedded\nin locally isothermal {\\alpha}-disks in steady-state accretion, with various\nvalues of {\\alpha}. Arbitrary planetary accretion rates were used as a means to\ndiminish or nullify orbit-crossing flows. Results. We confirm that the\nmigration rate of a gap-opening planet is indeed proportional to the disk's\nviscosity, but is not equal to the gas drift speed in the unperturbed disk. We\nshow that the role of gap-crossing flows is in fact negligible. Conclusions.\nFrom these observations, we propose a new paradigm for type II migration : a\ngiant planet feels a torque from the disk that promotes its migration, while\nthe gap profile relative to the planet is restored on a viscous timescale, thus\nlimiting the planet migration rate to be proportional to the disk's viscosity.\nHence, in disks with low viscosity in the planet region, type II migration\nshould still be very slow.

These exospheres are formed by surface\nparticles that have been sputtered by the wind of the host star. The stellar\nwind properties are derived from magnetohydrodynamic simulations, which are\ndriven by observationally-derived stellar magnetic field maps, and constrained\nby Ly-alpha observations of wind mass-loss rates, making this one of the most\nwell constrained model of winds of low-mass stars. The proximity of the planets\nto their host star implies a high flux of incident stellar wind particles, thus\nthe sputtering process is sufficiently effective to build up relatively dense,\nrefractory-rich exospheres. The sputtering releases refractory elements from\nthe entire dayside surfaces of the planets, with elements such as O and Mg\ncreating an extended neutral exosphere with densities larger than 10/cm3,\nextending to several planetary radii.

We explore such correlations and data specific to\nthe multiplanetary-system of TRAPPIST-1 and study their value for our\nunderstanding of planet interiors.

Our\nmethodology includes a Bayesian inference analysis that uses a Markov chain\nMonte Carlo scheme. Our interior estimates account for the anticipated\nvariability in the compositions and layer thicknesses of core, mantle, water\noceans and ice layers, and a gas envelope.

We present three-dimensional\nnumerical simulations of the tidal interaction between a protoplanetary disc\nand a misaligned planet.

It could be that moderately red surfaces are older or less ice rich and\nTNOs larger than 800 km have fresher surfaces or are able to hold onto more\nvolatile ices.

Exoplanet detection surveys and protoplanetary disk surveys are now\nproviding results that allow us to have new insights. We collect the masses of\nconfirmed exoplanets and compare their dependence with stellar mass with the\nsame dependence for protoplanetary disk masses measured in ~1-3 Myr old\nstar-forming regions. The latter are recalculated by us using the new estimates\nof their distances derived from Gaia DR2 parallaxes. We note that single and\nmultiple exoplanetary systems form two different populations, probably pointing\nto a different formation mechanism for massive giant planets around very low\nmass stars. While expecting that the mass in exoplanetary systems is much lower\nthan the measured disk masses, we instead find that exoplanetary systems masses\nare comparable or higher than the most massive disks. This same result is found\nalso by converting the measured planet masses into heavy-element content (core\nmasses for the giant planets and full masses for the super-Earth systems) and\nby comparing this value with the disk dust masses. Unless disk dust masses are\nheavily underestimated, this is a big conundrum. An extremely efficient\nrecycling of dust particles in the disk cannot solve this conundrum.

However, to use polarization for probing the disk properties, its\nproduction mechanism must be ascertained first. To date, the conventional\nmechanism involving magnetically aligned grains fails to explain the\npolarization patterns detected in most disks. This is especially true for the\ninclined disk of HL Tau in ALMA Band 3 (wavelength $\\sim 3$ mm), which has an\nelliptical polarization pattern. The elliptical pattern was taken as evidence\nfor polarized emission by dust grains aligned with their long axes\nperpendicular the direction of the radiative flux. We show that the radiatively\naligned grains produce a circular, rather than elliptical, polarization pattern\neven in inclined disks such as HL Tau. An elliptical polarization pattern can\nbe produced if the grains are aligned aerodynamically by the difference in\nrotation speed between the dust and gas through the Gold mechanism.

Subsequent characterization of the\nmass-dependence of this behavior up to the age of the Sun led to the advent of\ngyrochronology, which uses the rotation rate of a star to infer its age from an\nempirical calibration. The efficacy of the method relies on predictable angular\nmomentum loss from a stellar wind entrained in the large-scale magnetic field\nproduced by global dynamo action. Recent observational evidence suggests that\nthe global dynamo begins to shut down near the middle of a star's main-sequence\nlifetime, leading to a disruption in the production of large-scale magnetic\nfield, a dramatic reduction in angular momentum loss, and a breakdown of\ngyrochronology relations. For solar-type stars this transition appears to occur\nnear the age of the Sun, when rotation becomes too slow to imprint Coriolis\nforces on the global convective patterns, reducing the shear induced by\ndifferential rotation, and disrupting the large-scale dynamo. We use data from\nBarnes (2007) to reveal the signature of this transition in the observations\nthat were originally used to validate gyrochronology. We propose that\nchromospheric activity may ultimately provide a more reliable age indicator for\nolder stars, and we suggest that asteroseismology can be used to help calibrate\nactivity-age relations for field stars beyond the middle of their main-sequence\nlifetimes. \n\n"}

We propose to\nestimate the variations in shape of the CCF by fitting a Skew Normal (SN)\ndensity which, unlike the commonly employed Normal density, includes a skewness\nparameter to capture the asymmetry of the CCF induced by stellar activity and\nthe convective blueshift. The performances of the proposed method are compared\nto the commonly employed Normal density using both simulations and real\nobservations, with different levels of activity and signal-to-noise ratio. When\nconsidering real observations, the correlation between the RV and the asymmetry\nof the CCF and between the RV and the width of the CCF are stronger when using\nthe parameters estimated with the SN density rather than the ones obtained with\nthe commonly employed Normal density. Using the proposed SN approach, the\nuncertainties estimated on the RV defined as the median of the SN are on\naverage 10% smaller than the uncertainties calculated on the mean of the\nNormal. The uncertainties estimated on the asymmetry parameter of the SN are on\naverage 15% smaller than the uncertainties measured on the Bisector Inverse\nSlope Span (BIS SPAN), which is the commonly used parameter to evaluate the\nasymmetry of the CCF. We also propose a new model to account for stellar\nactivity when fitting a planetary signal to RV data. Based on simple\nsimulations, we were able to demonstrate that this new model improves the\nplanetary detection limits by 12% compared to the model commonly used to\naccount for stellar activity. The SN density is a better model than the Normal\ndensity for characterizing the CCF since the correlations used to probe stellar\nactivity are stronger and the uncertainties of the RV estimate and the\nasymmetry of the CCF are both smaller. \n\n"}

We use an N-body\nintegration scheme that accounts for collisional fragmentation, and also\nperform a large set of control simulations that do not include an early giant\nplanet instability. Since the total particle number decreases slower when\ncollisional fragmentation is accounted for, the growing planets' orbits are\ndamped more strongly via dynamical friction and encounters with small bodies\nthat dissipate angular momentum (eg: hit-and-run impacts). Compared with\nsimulations without collisional fragmentation, our fully evolved systems\nprovide better matches to the solar system's terrestrial planets in terms of\ntheir compact mass distribution and dynamically cold orbits. Collisional\nprocesses also tend to lengthen the dynamical accretion timescales of Earth\nanalogs, and shorten those of Mars analogs.

In both cases, planetesimals can be dynamically\nexcited, transferred between stars or liberated to become free-floating (such\nas A/2017 U1 or 'Oumuamua) during the early cluster evolution. We find that\nplanetesimals captured from another star are not necessarily dynamically\ndistinct from those native to a star. After an encounter both native and\ncaptured planetesimals can exhibit aligned periastrons, qualitatively similar\nto that seen in the Solar system and commonly thought to be the signature of\nPlanet 9. We discuss the implications of our results for both our Solar system\nand exoplanetary systems. \n\n"}

This is in marked contrast to the many\nmulti-planet exoplanetary systems that do not conform to this pristine picture.\nThis major discrepancy calls for an explanation. We provide such an explanation\nin this work, based on analytical solutions of the cylindrical isothermal\nLane-Emden equation with rotation which do not depend on boundary conditions.\nThese ``intrinsic'' solutions of the differential equation attract the\nsolutions of the Cauchy problem and force them to oscillate permanently. The\noscillations create density maxima in which dust and planetesimals are trapped\nand they can form protoplanetary cores during the very early isothermal\nevolution of such protoplanetary nebulae. We apply this model to our solar\nnebula that formed in-situ a minimum of eleven protoplanetary cores that have\ngrown to planets which have survived undisturbed to the present day. We are\nalso in the process of applying the same model to the ALMA/DSHARP disks. \n\n"}

In this work, we\ninvestigate the nature of these arc-like structures connected to the HL Tau\ndisk. We conducted new observations in the 13CO and C18O (3-2; 2-1) lines with\nJCMT and IRAM 30m, and obtained the ACA data with the 7-m array. With the\nsingle-dish, ACA, and ALMA data, we analyzed the gas motions on both 0.1 pc and\n1000 au scales in the HL Tau region. We constructed new kinematical models of\nan infalling and rotating envelope with the consideration of relative motion\nbetween HL Tau and the envelope. By including the relative motion between HL\nTau and its protostellar envelope, our kinematical model can explain the\nobserved velocity features in the arc-like structures. The morphologies of the\narc-like structures can also be explained with an asymmetric initial density\ndistribution in our model envelope. In addition, our single-dish results\nsupport that HL Tau is located at the edge of a large-scale (0.1 pc) expanding\nshell driven by the wind or outflow from XZ Tau, as suggested in the\nliterature. The estimated expanding velocity of the shell is comparable to the\nrelative velocity between HL Tau and its envelope in our kinematical model.\nThese results hints that the large-scale expanding motion likely impacts the\nprotostellar envelope around HL Tau and affects its gas kinematics. We found\nthat the mass infalling rate from the envelope onto the HL Tau disk can be\ndecreased by a factor of two due to this impact by the large-scale expanding\nshell. \n\n"}

For the binary and higher order multiple\nsystems observed, we detect $\\lambda = 1.3$ mm continuum emission from one or\nmore stars in all of our target systems. Combined with previous surveys of\nTaurus, our 21 new detections increase the fraction of millimeter-detected\ndisks to over 75% in all categories of stars (singles, primaries, and\ncompanions) earlier than spectral type M6 in the Class II sample. Given the\nwealth of other information available for these stars, this has allowed us to\nstudy the impact of multiplicity with a much larger sample.

Here, we\ndescribe a prebiotically plausible environment that draws on the strengths of\nboth scenarios: surface hydrothermal vents. We show how key feedstock molecules\nfor prebiotic chemistry can be produced in abundance in shallow and surficial\nhydrothermal systems. We calculate the chemistry of volcanic gases feeding\nthese vents over a range of pressures and basalt C/N/O contents. If\nultra-reducing carbon-rich nitrogen-rich gases interact with subsurface water\nat a volcanic vent they result in 1 mM to 1 M concentrations of diacetylene,\nacetylene, cyanoacetylene, hydrogen cyanide, bisulfite, hydrogen sulfide and\nsoluble iron in vent water. One key feedstock molecule, cyanamide, is not\nformed in significant quantities within this scenario, suggesting that it may\nneed to be delivered exogenously, or formed from hydrogen cyanide either via\norganometallic compounds, or by some as yet-unknown chemical synthesis.

They\npose challenges to the usual interior rubble-pile structure unless a relatively\nhigh bulk density is assumed. So far, only six large SFRs have been found.\nTherefore, we present a survey of asteroid rotation period using Pan-STARRS 1\ntelescopes during 2016 October 26 to 31 to search more large SFRs and study\ntheir properties. A total of 876 reliable rotation periods are measured, among\nwhich seven are large SFRs, thereby increasing the inventory of known large\nSFRs. These seven newly discovered large SFRs have diverse colors and locations\nin the main asteroid belt, suggesting that the taxonomic tendency and the\nlocation preference in the inner main belt of the six perviously known large\nSFRs could be a bias due to various observational limits. Interestingly, five\nout of the seven newly discovered large SFRs are mid main-belt asteroids.\nConsidering the rare discovery rates of large SFR in the previously similar\nsurveys (Chang et al., 2015, 2016) and the survey condition in this work, the\nchance of detecting a large SFR in the inner main belt seems to be relatively\nlow. This probably suggests that the inner main belt harbors less large SFRs\nthan the mid main belt. From our survey, we also found the drop in number\nappearing at f > 5 rev/day on the spin-rate distribution for the outer\nmain-belt asteroids of D < 3 km, which was reported for the inner and mid main\nbelt by (Chang et al., 2015, 2016). \n\n"}
