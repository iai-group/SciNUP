Observation of spectral splits in a future galactic\nsupernova signal is expected to throw light on the mass hierarchy pattern of\nthe neutrinos. However, since the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background (DSNB)\ncomprises of a superposition of neutrino fluxes from all past supernovae, and\nsince different supernovae are expected to have slightly different initial\nfluxes, it is pertinent to check if the hierarchy dependent signature of\ncollective oscillations can survive this averaging of the flux spectra.

The transition is through a\nmassless Dirac-Weyl semimetal, point Fermi surface phase which is unique in\nthat (1) it appears in a three dimensional crystal, (2) the band critical point\noccurs at $k$=0, and (3) linear bands are degenerate with conventional\n(massive) bands at the critical point (before inclusion of spin-orbit\ncoupling). Further interest arises because the critical point separates a\nconventional (trivial) phase from a topological phase. In the native cubic\nstructure this is a zero-gap topological semimetal; we show how spin-orbit\ncoupling and uniaxial strain converts the system to a topological insulator\n(TI). We also analyze the origin of the linear band in this class of materials,\nwhich is the characteristic that makes them potentially useful in\nthermoelectric applications or possibly as transparent conductors. We\ncharacterize the formal charge as Co$^{+}$ $d^8$, consistent with the gap, with\nits $\\bar{3}$ site symmetry, and with its lack of moment.

Within the developed framework of glassy components in a solid,\nwe give a summary of the results and predictions for the effects that cover the\nmechanical, thermodynamic, viscoelastic, and electro-elastic contributions of\nthe glassy response of solid He-4. Our proposed glass model for solid He-4 has\nseveral implications: (1) The anomalous properties of He-4 can be accounted for\nby allowing defects to freeze out at lowest temperatures. The dynamics of solid\nHe-4 is governed by glasslike (glassy) relaxation processes and the\ndistribution of relaxation times varies significantly between different\ntorsional oscillator, shear modulus, and dielectric function experiments.

Similar results apply for other response functions. (4)\nUsing the framework of glassy dynamics, we predict low-frequency yet to be\nmeasured electro-elastic features in defect rich He-4 crystals.

We compute corrected\ndeposition-efficiency curves for annihilating dark matter, and demonstrate how\nto compute equivalent curves for arbitrary energy-injection histories. These\ncalculations provide the necessary inputs for the limits on dark matter\nannihilation presented in the accompanying Paper I, but also have potential\napplications in the context of dark matter decay or de-excitation, decay of\nother metastable species, or similar energy injections from new physics. We\nmake our full results publicly available at\nhttp://nebel.rc.fas.harvard.edu/epsilon, to facilitate further independent\nstudies. In particular, we provide the full low-energy electron and photon\nspectra, to allow matching onto more detailed codes that describe the cooling\nof such particles at low energies. \n\n"}

Under what conditions does the latter picture break down? The\npresence of irremovable quantum entanglement between different sites can\nobstruct a localized orbital description, which occurs in systems like Chern\nand topological insulators. We collectively refer to such states as Quantum\nBand Insulators (QBIs). Here we report the theoretical discovery of a\nfilling-enforced QBI - that is, a free electron insulator in which the band\nfilling is smaller than the minimum number dictated by the atomic picture.\nConsequently such insulators have no representation in terms of filling\nlocalized orbitals and must be QBIs. This is shown to occur in models of\ncertain cubic crystals with non-symmorphic space groups. Like topological\ninsulators, filling-enforced QBIs require spin-orbit coupling. However, in\ncontrast, they do not typically exhibit protected surface states. Instead their\nnontrivial nature is revealed by studying the quantum entanglement of their\nground state wavefunction. \n\n"}

For a coboundary Poisson-Lie group $G$, this\nnon-abelian moment map must obey the Semenov-Tian-Shansky bracket on the dual\ngroup $G^*$, up to terms involving central quantities. When the latter vanish,\nwe develop a general procedure linking this Poisson bracket to the defining\nrelations of the Poisson-Hopf algebra $\\mathscr U_q(\\mathfrak g)$, including\nthe $q$-Poisson-Serre relations. We consider reality conditions leading to $q$\nbeing either real or a phase. We determine the non-abelian moment map for\nYang-Baxter type models. This enables to compute the corresponding action of\n$G$ on the fields parametrising the phase space of these models. \n\n"}

Explicitly, the effective Lagrangian for\n$\\mathcal{N} = 1$ SUSY Yang-Mills is constructed and shown to be a complete\ndescription for the infrared of this model. For contrast, we also construct the\neffective Lagrangian for chiral SUSY theories with Yukawa couplings,\nspecifically the single flavor Wess-Zumino model.

In the\nfirst series of experiments, injection-molded samples are used without thermal\npre-treatment. In the second and third series, prior to testing the specimens\nare annealed at 130 C for 4 and 24 hours, respectively. Constitutive equations\nare derived for the time-dependent response of semicrystalline polymers at\nisothermal loading. A polymer is treated as an equivalent temporary network of\nmacromolecules bridged by junctions (physical cross-links, entanglements and\ncrystalline lamellae). Under loading, junctions slip with respect to their\npositions in the bulk material (which reflects the viscoplastic behavior),\nwhereas chains separate from their junctions and merge with new ones at random\ntimes (which reflects the viscoelastic response). The network is thought of as\nan ensemble of meso-regions (MR) with various activation energies for\ndetachment of chains from temporary nodes. Adjustable parameters in the\nstress-strain relations are found by fitting observations. Experimental data\ndemonstrate that the shape of the relaxation spectrum (characterized by the\ndistribution of MRs with various potential energies) is independent of\nmechanical factors, but is altered at annealing. For specimens not subjected to\nthermal treatment, the growth of longitudinal strain does not affect the volume\nfraction of active MRs and the attempt rate for detachment of chains from their\njunctons. For annealed samples, the concentration of active MRs increases and\nthe attempt rate decreases with strain. These changes in the time-dependent\nresponse are attributed to broadening of the distribution of strengths of\ncrystalline lamellae at annealing. \n\n"}

The scenario has been experimentally verified by MIT group\nemploying $^{23}$Na atoms. Recently similar experiments have been conducted at\nKyoto University, in which BEC of $^{87}$Rb atoms has been used. In the latter\nexperiments they found that the fine-tuning of the field reverse time $T_{\\rm\nrev}$ is required to achieve stable vortex formation. Otherwise, they often\nobserved vortex fragmentations or a condensate without a vortex.

We examine the Einstein\nequations induced on a general $(n-2)$-brane of arbitrary tension, embedded in\nsome $n$-dimensional bulk. The brane energy-momentum tensor enters these\nequations both linearly and quadratically. From the point of view of a\nhomogeneous and isotropic brane we see quadratic deviations from the FRW\nequations of the standard cosmology. There is also a contribution from a bulk\nWeyl tensor. We study this in detail when the bulk is AdS-Schwarzschild or\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"om AdS. This contribution can be understood holographically.\nFor the AdS-Schwarzschild case, we show that the geometry on a brane near the\nAdS boundary is just that of a radiation dominated FRW universe. The radiation\ncomes from a field theory that is dual to the AdS bulk. We also develop a new\napproach which allows us to consider branes that are not near the AdS boundary.\nThis time the dual field theory contributes quadratic energy density/pressure\nterms to the FRW equations. Remarkably, these take exactly the same form as for\nadditional matter placed on the brane by hand, with no bulk Weyl tensor.\n  We also derive the general equations of motion for a braneworld containing a\ndomain wall. For the critical brane, the induced geometry is identical to that\nof a vacuum domain wall in $(n-1)$-dimensional Einstein gravity. We develop the\ntools to construct a nested Randall-Sundrum scenario whereby we have a\n``critical'' domain wall living on an anti-de Sitter brane.

We use dimensional analysis and\npower-counting arguments to place constraints on the changes of initial\nconditions in systems with different center of mass energy $\\sqrt{s}$.\nSpecifically, we show that a large class of changes in the (initial) equation\nof state, mean free path, and longitudinal geometry over the observed\n$\\sqrt{s}$ are likely to spoil the scaling in $v_2$ observed experimentally. We\ntherefore argue that the system produced at most Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS)\nand Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) energies is fundamentally the same\nas far as the soft and approximately thermalized degrees of freedom are\nconsidered. The ``sQGP'' (Strongly interacting Quark-Gluon Plasma) phase, if it\nis there, is therefore not exclusive to RHIC. We suggest, as a goal for further\nlow-energy heavy ion experiments, to search for a ``transition'' $\\sqrt{s}$\nwhere the observed scaling breaks. \n\n"}

{"id": "physics/0701039", "contents": "Title: Optimization of quantum Monte Carlo wave functions by energy\n  minimization Abstract: We study three wave function optimization methods based on energy\nminimization in a variational Monte Carlo framework: the Newton, linear and\nperturbative methods. In the Newton method, the parameter variations are\ncalculated from the energy gradient and Hessian, using a reduced variance\nstatistical estimator for the latter. In the linear method, the parameter\nvariations are found by diagonalizing a non-symmetric estimator of the\nHamiltonian matrix in the space spanned by the wave function and its\nderivatives with respect to the parameters, making use of a strong\nzero-variance principle. In the less computationally expensive perturbative\nmethod, the parameter variations are calculated by approximately solving the\ngeneralized eigenvalue equation of the linear method by a nonorthogonal\nperturbation theory. These general methods are illustrated here by the\noptimization of wave functions consisting of a Jastrow factor multiplied by an\nexpansion in configuration state functions (CSFs) for the C$_2$ molecule,\nincluding both valence and core electrons in the calculation. The Newton and\nlinear methods are very efficient for the optimization of the Jastrow, CSF and\norbital parameters. The perturbative method is a good alternative for the\noptimization of just the CSF and orbital parameters. Although the optimization\nis performed at the variational Monte Carlo level, we observe for the C$_2$\nmolecule studied here, and for other systems we have studied, that as more\nparameters in the trial wave functions are optimized, the diffusion Monte Carlo\ntotal energy improves monotonically, implying that the nodal hypersurface also\nimproves monotonically. \n\n"}
