The behavior of these volumes is strongly influenced by the\nregular or chaotic nature of the motion, the number of deviation vectors, their\nlinear (in)dependence and the spectrum of Lyapunov exponents. The different\ntime evolution of these volumes can be used to identify rapidly and efficiently\nthe nature of the dynamics, leading to the introduction of quantities that\nclearly distinguish between chaotic behavior and quasiperiodic motion on\n$N$-dimensional tori.

Some theoretical\nestimates for the cores of relaxed clusters predict an excess of helium\nabundance by up to a factor of a few over its primordial value. The\nintracluster helium abundance cannot be measured directly. This presents a\nsignificant source of uncertainty for cosmological tests based on the X-ray\nderived cluster quantities, such as the gas mass, total mass, and gas mass\nfraction, all of which depend on the assumed helium abundance. We point out\nthat cluster distances derived by combining the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) and\nX-ray data also depend on the helium abundance. This dependence can be used to\nmeasure the abundance, provided the distance is known independently. For\nexample, if one adopts the WMAP H_0 value, then the recent H_0 measurement by\nBonamente and collaborators, derived from SZ data on 38 clusters assuming a\nprimordial helium abundance, corresponds to an abundance excess by a factor of\n1.9+-0.8 within r~1 Mpc (using only their statistical errors).

Our method takes advantage of the same\nelectron bunch to produce both an XFEL pulse and an ultrashort optical pulse\nwith the help of an optical radiator downstream of the x-ray undulator. Since\nboth pulses are produced by the same electron bunch, they are perfectly\nsynchronized. Application of cross-correlation techniques will allow to\ndetermine relative jitter between the optical pulse (and, thus, the XFEL pulse)\nand a pulse from an external pump-laser with femtosecond resolution. Technical\nrealization of the proposed timing scheme uses an optical replica synthesizer\n(ORS) setup to be installed after the final bunch-compression stage of the\nXFEL. The electron bunch is modulated in the ORS setup by an external optical\nlaser. Subsequently, it travels through the main undulator, and produces the\nXFEL pulse. Finally, a powerful optical pulse of coherent edge radiation is\ngenerated as the bunch passes through a long straight section and a separation\nmagnet downstream of the main undulator. Our study shows that at a moderate\n(about 10%) density modulation of the electron bunch at the location of the\noptical radiator allows production of high power x-ray and optical pulses.\nRelative synchronization of these pulses is preserved by using the same\nmechanical support for both x-ray and optical elements transporting radiation\ndown to the experimental area, where single-shot cross-correlation between\noptical pulse and pump-laser pulse is performed.

The\nstraightforward model has the same ETC structure as that of Appelquist et al.\nwithout topcolor which we first analyze to find that it yields only too small\nETC-induced mass for the third generation. In contrast, our model having\ntopcolor takes the form of a version of the topcolor-assisted technicolor (TC2)\nafter ETC breakings, which triggers the top quark condensate giving rise to a\nrealistic top mass.

We test this numerical solver against analytic solutions of the\nevolution of the photon distribution in rest background, analytic solution in\nexpanding background without resonant scattering and formation of local\nBoltzmann distribution around the resonant frequency with the temperature same\nas that of atom for recoil. We find that evolution of photon distribution\nundergoes three phases; profile is similar to the initial one, a flat plateau\n(without recoil) or local Boltzmann distribution (with recoil) forms around the\nresonant frequency, and finally the distribution around the resonant frequency\nis saturated when the photons from the source is balanced by the redshift of\nthe expansion. This result indicates that the onset of the W-F coupling should\nnot be determined by the third phase, but by the time scale of the second\nphase. We found that the time scale of the W-F coupling is equal to about a few\nhundreds of the mean free flight time of photons with resonant frequency, and\nis independent of the Sobolev parameter if this parameter is much less than 1. \n\n"}

The approximately equal hierarchies between successive generations,\nthe sizes of the mixing angles, the heaviness of just the top quark, and the\napproximate down-lepton equality can all be accommodated by many flavor models\nbut can appear ad hoc. We present a simple, predictive mechanism to explain\nthese patterns. All generations are treated democratically and the flavor\nsymmetries are broken collectively by only two allowed couplings in\nflavor-space, a vector and matrix, with arbitrary O(1) entries. Repeated use of\nthese flavor symmetry breaking spurions radiatively generates the Yukawa\ncouplings with a natural hierarchy. We demonstrate this idea with two models in\na split supersymmetric grand unified framework, with minimal additional\nparticle content at the unification scale. Although flavor is generated at the\nGUT scale, there are several potentially testable predictions. In our minimal\nmodel the usual prediction of exact b-tau unification is replaced by the SU(5)\nbreaking relation m_tau / m_b = 3 / 2, in better agreement with observations.\nOther SU(5) breaking effects in the fermion masses can easily arise directly\nfrom the flavor model itself. The symmetry breaking that triggers the\ngeneration of flavor necessarily gives rise to an axion, solving the strong CP\nproblem. These theories contain long-lived particles whose decays could give\nstriking signatures at the LHC and may solve the primordial Lithium problems.\nThese models also give novel proton decay signatures which can be probed by the\nnext generation of experiments.

The recently launched BES-III program, with $10^8$ $\\eta_c$\nsamples to be anticipated in the coming years, may be able to observe the\nDalitz decays $\\eta_c\\to e^+e^-\\gamma$ and $\\eta_c\\to \\mu^+\\mu^-\\gamma$, which\nhave branching ratios of order $10^{-6}$. When the radiated photon becomes very\nsoft, the Dalitz decay events will be experimentally tagged as the exclusive\nlepton pair events. It is found that, those quasi-two-body events that arise\nfrom $\\eta_c\\to e^+ e^-\\gamma$ with photon energy less than the minimum\nsensitivity of the electromagnetic calorimeter, can vastly outnumber the\nliteral $\\eta_c\\to e^+ e^-$ events, however this amplification is still not\ndramatic enough for the BES-III experiment to establish these events.\nConsequently, the expectation of looking for new physics signature in the\n$\\eta_c\\to l^+l^-$ channel is obscured, unless the contamination from $\\eta_c\n\\to l^+l^-\\gamma$ has been taken into account carefully. \n\n"}

In these detectors, atmospheric muons from primary cosmic\nray interactions in the atmosphere play an important role. They provide the\nmost abundant source of events for calibration and for testing the\nreconstruction algorithms. On the other hand, they represent the major\nbackground source. The simulation of a statistically significant number of\nmuons in large volume neutrino telescopes requires a big effort in terms of\ncomputing time.

We\nuse a large Monte Carlo library of SFHs to study as a function of galaxy\nspectral type and signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) the statistical uncertainties of\nM/L values using either absorption-line data or broad band colors. The accuracy\nof M/L estimates can be significantly improved by using metal-sensitive indices\nin combination with age-sensitive indices, in particular for galaxies with\nintermediate-age or young stellar populations.

Such neutrinos would decouple early, with relic densities comparable\nto those of photons, but decay out of equilibrium, with consequent prodigious\nentropy generation prior to, or during, Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). Most of\nthe ranges of sterile neutrino rest mass and lifetime considered are at odds\nwith Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) limits on the relativistic particle\ncontribution to energy density (e.g., as parameterized by N_eff).

The physics programme also includes electron-deuteron and\nelectron-ion scattering in a $(Q^2, 1/x)$ range extended by four orders of\nmagnitude as compared to previous lepton-nucleus DIS experiments for novel\ninvestigations of neutron's and nuclear structure, the initial conditions of\nQuark-Gluon Plasma formation and further quantum chromodynamic phenomena. The\nLHeC may be realised either as a ring-ring or as a linac-ring collider. Optics\nand beam dynamics studies are presented for both versions, along with technical\ndesign considerations on the interaction region, magnets and further\ncomponents, together with a design study for a high acceptance detector. Civil\nengineering and installation studies are presented for the accelerator and the\ndetector. The LHeC can be built within a decade and thus be operated while the\nLHC runs in its high-luminosity phase. It thus represents a major opportunity\nfor progress in particle physics exploiting the investment made in the LHC. \n\n"}

This data set comprises 5337\nhours of observations recorded by an array of 84 polarized coherent receivers\nwith a total array sensitivity of 87 uK sqrt(s). Four low-foreground fields\nwere observed, covering a total of ~1000 square degrees with an effective\nangular resolution of 12.8', allowing for constraints on primordial\ngravitational waves and high-signal-to-noise measurements of the E-modes across\nthree acoustic peaks. The data reduction was performed using two independent\nanalysis pipelines, one based on a pseudo-Cl (PCL) cross-correlation approach,\nand the other on a maximum-likelihood (ML) approach. All data selection\ncriteria and filters were modified until a predefined set of null tests had\nbeen satisfied before inspecting any non-null power spectrum. The results\nderived by the two pipelines are in good agreement.

Our study is conducted from the perspective of a user of\nthe models, who has observational data in hand and seeks to convert them into\nphysical quantities. Stellar population models for galaxies are created by\nsynthesizing star formations histories and chemical enrichments using single\nstellar populations from several groups (Starburst99, GALAXEV, Maraston2005,\nGALEV). The role of dust is addressed through a simplistic, but observationally\nmotivated, dust model that couples the amplitude of the extinction to the star\nformation history, metallicity and the viewing angle. Moreover, the influence\nof emission lines is considered (for the subset of models for which this\ncomponent is included). The performance of the models is investigated by: 1)\ncomparing their prediction with the observed galaxy population in the SDSS\nusing the (u-g)-(r-i) and (g-r)-(i-z) color planes, 2) comparing predicted\nstellar mass and luminosity weighted ages and metallicities, specific star\nformation rates, mass to light ratios and total extinctions with literature\nvalues from studies based on spectroscopy. Strong differences between the\nvarious models are seen, with several models occupying regions in the\ncolor-color diagrams where no galaxies are observed.

It is valid at any\npoint in space, i.e. in the plane of the distribution (inside and outside) as\nwell as off-plane, thereby generalizing the results reported by Durand (1953)\nfor the circular disc.

As a by-product, we generate an integral theorem stating that\n\"the angular average of the potential of any circular sector along its tangent\ncircle is 2/PI times the value at the corner\".

Abstract: The dominant decay mode of standard model Higgs at 126 GeV $b\\bar{b}$ suffers\nfrom severe SM background at the LHC even in associated productions $Wh_{\\rm\nSM}$ or $Z h_{\\rm SM}$. The precision measurement of BR($\\phi\\to b\\bar{b})$\nrequires more data to reduce its large error bar. We investigate the\npossibility of this channel with largest uncertainty not dominating the decay\nof Higgs-like boson discovered at the LHC. In such scenarios, the Higgs signal\nshows highly suppressed $b\\bar{b}$, slightly reduced $\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$ and\nmoderately enhanced gauge bosons comparing with the SM predictions. The model\nrequires two different sources of electroweak symmetry breaking and radiative\ncorrection to $m_{b}$ strongly enhanced. However, large reduction in $b\\bar{b}$\nusually results large enhancement in $\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$ mode in particular. The\nreduction of $\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$ therefore implies that a new decay mode is\ninevitable. We find that a non-decoupling MSSM Higgs decay into lighter Higgs\n$H\\to hh$ may fit the signature.

We investigate different approaches to\nestablish the accuracy that can be reached by the LSST six-band photometry.

The photo-z reconstruction\nfrom both of these techniques is tested on real CFHTLS data and also on\nsimulated catalogs. We describe a new method to improve photo-z reconstruction\nthat efficiently removes catastrophic outliers via a likelihood ratio\nstatistical test. This test uses the posterior probability functions of the fit\nparameters and the colors. We show that the photometric redshift accuracy will\nmeet the stringent LSST requirements up to redshift $\\sim2.5$ after a selection\nthat is based on the likelihood ratio test or on the apparent magnitude for\ngalaxies with $S/N>5$ in at least 5 bands.

We put forward a hypothesis that the physical\nUniverse includes a quantum environment that interacts with particle scattering\nprocesses. While the scattering process is governed by the S-matrix the\ninteraction evolves the produced state rho_f(S) to observed state rho_f(O). To\nbe consistent with the Standard Model this new interaction must be a pure\ndephasing interaction governed by a non-unitary evolution law modifying the\nphases of the amplitudes. We present the first test of the unitary evolution\nlaw in particle scattering. The unitary evolution law evolves pure initial\nstates into pure final states in exclusive processes. This fact leads to 9\nindependent constraints on 16 components of angular intensities in piN->pipiN\nprocesses. When expressed in terms of P-parity conserving transversity\namplitudes all 9 constraints are identities provided a single constrain on the\ntransversity amplitudes holds true. The constraint implies that the relative\nphases between transverity amplitudes of the same naturality and transversity\nmust be 0 or +/- pi. All previous amplitude analyses of the piN->pipiN\nprocesses found non-unitary relative phases in an apparent violation of the\nunitary evolution law. The contrast between the predicted and the observed\nrelative phases presents an unambigous evidence for the existence of the\nquantum environment and its pure dephasing interaction with particle scattering\nprocesses. \n\n"}

{"id": "1305.5278", "contents": "Title: The second laws of quantum thermodynamics Abstract: The second law of thermodynamics tells us which state transformations are so\nstatistically unlikely that they are effectively forbidden. Its original\nformulation, due to Clausius, states that \"Heat can never pass from a colder to\na warmer body without some other change, connected therewith, occurring at the\nsame time\". The second law applies to systems composed of many particles\ninteracting; however, we are seeing that one can make sense of thermodynamics\nin the regime where we only have a small number of particles interacting with a\nheat bath. Is there a second law of thermodynamics in this regime? Here, we\nfind that for processes which are cyclic or very close to cyclic, the second\nlaw for microscopic systems takes on a very different form than it does at the\nmacroscopic scale, imposing not just one constraint on what state\ntransformations are possible, but an entire family of constraints. In\nparticular, we find a family of free energies which generalise the traditional\none, and show that they can never increase. We further find that there are\nthree regimes which determine which family of second laws govern state\ntransitions, depending on how cyclic the process is. In one regime one can\ncause an apparent violation of the usual second law, through a process of\nembezzling work from a large system which remains arbitrarily close to its\noriginal state. These second laws are not only relevant for small systems, but\nalso apply to individual macroscopic systems interacting via long-range\ninteractions, which only satisfy the ordinary second law on average. By making\nprecise the definition of thermal operations, the laws of thermodynamics take\non a simple form with the first law defining the class of thermal operations,\nthe zeroeth law emerging as a unique condition ensuring the theory is\nnontrivial, and the remaining laws being a monotonicity property of our\ngeneralised free energies. \n\n"}

Such contamination can lead to significant errors in the gas\ndistribution of hydrodynamical simulations, as we show. For a fixed Lagrange\nvolume, we find that the chance of contamination increases systematically with\nthe level of zoom. In order to avoid contamination, the Lagrangian volume\nselected for resimulation must increase monotonically with the resolution\ndifference between parent box and the zoom region. We provide a simple formula\nfor selecting Lagrangian regions (in units of the halo virial volume) as a\nfunction of the level of zoom required.

We explore this issue by comparing a suite of Gadget-3 SPH simulations\nof idealised (i.e., non-cosmological) isolated discs and galaxy mergers with\notherwise identical calculations performed using the moving-mesh code Arepo.\nWhen black hole (BH) accretion and active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback are\nnot included, the star formation histories (SFHs) obtained from the two codes\nagree well. When BHs are included, the code- and resolution-dependent\nvariations in the SFHs are more significant, but the agreement is still good,\nand the stellar mass formed over the course of a simulation is robust to\nvariations in the numerical method. During a merger, the gas morphology and\nphase structure are initially similar prior to the starburst phase. However,\nonce a hot gaseous halo has formed from shock heating and AGN feedback (when\nincluded), the agreement is less good. In particular, during the post-starburst\nphase, the SPH simulations feature more prominent hot gaseous haloes and\nspurious clumps, whereas with Arepo, gas clumps and filaments are less apparent\nand the hot halo gas can cool more efficiently.

JKCS041 is thus a progenitor of a\nlocal system like the Coma cluster.

These quiescent galaxies\nare concentrated around the cluster center with a core radius of 330 kpc. Blue\nmembers are few and avoid the cluster center. In JKCS041 quenching was\ntherefore largely completed by a look-back time of 10 Gyr and we can constrain\nthe epoch at which this occurred via spectroscopic age-dating of the individual\ngalaxies. Most galaxies were quenched about 1.1 Gyr prior to the epoch of\nobservation. The less massive quiescent galaxies are somewhat younger,\ncorresponding to a decrease in age of 650 Myr per mass dex, but the scatter in\nage at fixed mass is only 380 Myr (at $\\log M=11$). The size-mass relation of\nquiescent galaxies in JKCS041 is consistent with that observed for local\nclusters within our uncertainties.

Despite observing JKCS041 soon after\nits quenching and the three fold expected increase in mass in the next 10 Gyr,\nit is already remarkably similar to present-day clusters. \n\n"}

On average, observational data follow model predictions, but\nwith some scatter, so that systems with the same physical parameters (age,\nmetallicity, total mass) produce a variety of integrated spectra. The fewer the\nstars in a system, the larger is the scatter. Such scatter is sometimes much\nlarger than the observational errors, reflecting its physical nature.

Abstract: If the second law of thermodynamics forbids a transition from one state to\nanother, then it is still possible to make the transition happen by using a\nsufficient amount of work. But if we do not have access to this amount of work,\ncan the transition happen probabilistically? In the thermodynamic limit, this\nprobability tends to zero, but here we find that for finite-sized systems, it\ncan be finite. We compute the maximum probability of a transition or a\nthermodynamical fluctuation from any initial state to any final state, and show\nthat this maximum can be achieved for any final state which is block-diagonal\nin the energy eigenbasis. We also find upper and lower bounds on this\ntransition probability, in terms of the work of transition. As a bi-product, we\nintroduce a finite set of thermodynamical monotones related to the\nthermo-majorization criteria which governs state transitions, and compute the\nwork of transition in terms of them. The trade-off between the probability of a\ntransition, and any partial work added to aid in that transition is also\nconsidered.

One of the main difficulties is to\ncapture a suitable notion of work that models realistically the purpose of\nquantum machines, in an analogous way to the role played, for macroscopic\nmachines, by the energy stored in the idealisation of a lifted weight. Despite\nof several attempts to resolve this issue by putting forward specific models,\nthese are far from capturing realistically the transitions that a quantum\nmachine is expected to perform. In this work, we adopt a novel strategy by\nconsidering arbitrary kinds of systems that one can attach to a quantum thermal\nmachine and seeking for work quantifiers. These are functions that measure the\nvalue of a transition and generalise the concept of work beyond the model of a\nlifted weight. We do so by imposing simple operational axioms that any\nreasonable work quantifier must fulfil and by deriving from them stringent\nmathematical condition with a clear physical interpretation. Our approach\nallows us to derive much of the structure of the theory of thermodynamics\nwithout taking as a primitive the definition of work.

The approach presented now allows the extension of the single shot\nwork concept to work extraction (b) involving multiple final levels of the\nweight.

We derive the maximum efficiency for the case when\none of the baths is composed of qubits.

Along with the\nphase-locked, rolling polarization \"Koop spin wheel,\" resonant polarimetry\nmeasures beam polarization as amplitude rather than as intensity.\n  The polarization roll, at 100\\,Hz for example, and adjustable by a constant\ncontrol current, causes spurious torques due to field errors to average to zero\nto high accuracy. Since these torques have been considered to be the dominant\nsource of systematic error in truly frozen spin operation, this is a major\nimprovement resulting from the rolling polarization. Important sources of\nsystematic errors remain, the main one being due to Wien filter reversal\nuncertainty.\n  Both electron and proton spins can be \"frozen\" in all-electric storage rings,\nand their EDM precisions should be comparable. Freezing the deuteron spin\nrequires a superimposed electric and magnetic guide field; otherwise the\nrolling spin method and precision should be similar. \n\n"}

By\nusing a phenomenological equation of state (EOS) \"CRover\" which interpolates\nthe two phases at around 3 times the nuclear matter density, it is found that\nthe cold NSs with the gravitational mass larger than 2-solarmass can be\nsustained. This is in sharp contrast to the case of the first-order\nhadron-quark transition. The radii of the cold NSs with the CRover EOS are in\nthe narrow range which is insensitive to the NS masses. Due to the stiffening\nof the EOS induced by the hadron-quark crossover, the central density of the\nNSs is at most 4 times the nuclear matter density and the hyperon-mixing barely\noccurs inside the NS core.

In this work we show how to\nconstruct collective quantum heat machines and explore their performance boosts\nwith respect to regular machines. Without interactions between the machines the\nindividual units operate in a stochastic, non-quantum manner. The construction\nof the collective machine becomes possible by introducing two simple quantum\noperations: coherence extraction and coherence injection. Together these\noperations can harvest coherence from one engine and use it to boost the\nperformance of a slightly different engine. For weakly driven engines we show\nthat the collective work output scales quadratically with the number of engines\nrather than linearly. Eventually, the boost saturates and the scaling becomes\nlinear. Nevertheless, even in saturation, work is still significantly boosted\ncompared to individual operation.

The assumption of a\nuniversal coupling of glueballs to mass terms of the full nonet of pseudoscalar\nmesons leads to flavor asymmetries in the decay rates of scalar glueballs that\nagree well with experimental data for the glueball candidate $f_0(1710)$ and\nimplies a vanishing decay rate into $\\eta\\eta'$ pairs, for which only upper\nbounds for the $f_0(1710)$ meson are known at present from experiment.

Extrinsic sources of noise include\ncontributions from physical processes which are not sufficiently well modelled,\nfor example, dispersion and scattering effects, analysis errors and\ninstrumental instabilities. We present the results from a noise analysis for 42\nmillisecond pulsars (MSPs) observed with the European Pulsar Timing Array. For\ncharacterising the low-frequency, stochastic and achromatic noise component, or\n\"timing noise\", we employ two methods, based on Bayesian and frequentist\nstatistics. For 25 MSPs, we achieve statistically significant measurements of\ntheir timing noise parameters and find that the two methods give consistent\nresults.

Abstract: The difficulty of explaining non-local correlations in a fixed causal\nstructure sheds new light on the old debate on whether space and time are to be\nseen as fundamental. Refraining from assuming space-time as given a priori has\na number of consequences. First, the usual definitions of randomness depend on\na causal structure and turn meaningless. So motivated, we propose an intrinsic,\nphysically motivated measure for the randomness of a string of bits: its length\nminus its normalized work value, a quantity we closely relate to its Kolmogorov\ncomplexity (the length of the shortest program making a universal Turing\nmachine output this string). We test this alternative concept of randomness for\nthe example of non-local correlations, and we end up with a reasoning that\nleads to similar conclusions as in, but is conceptually more direct than, the\nprobabilistic view since only the outcomes of measurements that can actually\nall be carried out together are put into relation to each other. In the same\ncontext-free spirit, we connect the logical reversibility of an evolution to\nthe second law of thermodynamics and the arrow of time. Refining this, we end\nup with a speculation on the emergence of a space-time structure on bit strings\nin terms of data-compressibility relations. Finally, we show that logical\nconsistency, by which we replace the abandoned causality, it strictly weaker a\nconstraint than the latter in the multi-party case. \n\n"}

We focus on three main classes of systematics: (i) experimental\nsystematic errors in the observed shear; (ii) signal contamination by intrinsic\nalignments; and (iii) systematic effects due to an incorrect modelling of\nnon-linear scales. First, we show that a comprehensive, multi-wavelength\nanalysis provides a self-calibration method for experimental systematic\neffects, only implying <50% increment on the errors on cosmological parameters.\nWe also illustrate how the cross-correlation between radio and optical/near-IR\nsurveys alone is able to remove residual systematics with variance as large as\n0.00001, i.e. the same order of magnitude of the cosmological signal. This also\nopens the possibility of using such a cross-correlation as a means to detect\nunknown experimental systematics. Secondly, we demonstrate that, thanks to\npolarisation information, radio weak lensing surveys will be able to mitigate\ncontamination by intrinsic alignments, in a way similar but fully complementary\nto available self-calibration methods based on position-shear correlations.\nLastly, we illustrate how radio weak lensing experiments, reaching higher\nredshifts than those accessible to optical surveys, will probe dark energy and\nthe growth of cosmic structures in regimes less contaminated by non-linearities\nin the matter perturbations. For instance, the higher-redshift bins of radio\ncatalogues peak at z~0.8-1, whereas their optical/near-IR counterparts are\nlimited to z<0.5-0.7. This translates into having a cosmological signal 2 to 5\ntimes less contaminated by non-linear perturbations. \n\n"}

Such decays vanish within the SM and are highly suppressed in several\ntheoretical extensions. Due to its relevance and relative simplicity to\nreconstruct the signal at future colliders, it is an important tool to probe SM\nextensions where it could reach detectable levels.

The continuously growing \\cmb data sets render the \\cmb\nmap-making problem more challenging in terms of computational cost and memory\nin particular in the context of ground based experiments. In this context, we\nstudy a novel class of the Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) solvers\nwhich invoke two-level preconditioners. We compare them against PCG solvers\ncommonly used in the map-making context considering their precision and\ntime-to-solution. We compare these new methods on realistic, simulated data\nsets reflecting the characteristics of current and forthcoming \\cmb\nground-based experiment. We develop an embarrassingly parallel implementation\nof the approach where each processor performs a sequential map-making for a\nsubset of the TOD. We find that considering the map level residuals the new\nclass of solvers permits achieving tolerance of up to 3 orders of magnitude\nbetter than the standard approach, where the residual level often saturates\nbefore convergence is reached. This corresponds to an important improvement in\nthe precision of recovered power spectra in particular on the largest angular\nscales. The new method also typically requires fewer iterations to reach a\nrequired precision and thus shorter runtimes for a single map-making solution.\nHowever, the construction of an appropriate two-level preconditioner can be as\ncostly as a single standard map-making run. Nevertheless, if the same problem\nneeds to be solved multiple times, e.g., as in Monte Carlo simulations, this\ncost has to be incurred only once, and the method should be competitive not\nonly as far as its precision but also its performance is concerned. \n\n"}

Unexpected discoveries, such as the\ndiphoton excess F(750 GeV) seen at the LHC, could strongly motivate the\nconstruction of a photon collider. In order to enable the gamma-gamma collision\noption, the ILC design should be compatible with it from the very beginning. In\nthis paper, we discuss the problem of the beam crossing angle. In the ILC\ntechnical design, this angle is 14 mrad, which is just enough to provide enough\nspace for the final quadrupoles and outgoing beams. For gamma-gamma collisions,\nthe crossing angle must be larger because the low-energy electrons that result\nfrom multiple Compton scattering get large disruption angles in collisions with\nthe opposing electron beam and some deflection in the solenoidal detector\nfield. For a 2E=500 GeV collider, the required crossing angle is about 25 mrad.\nIn this paper, we consider the factors that determine the crossing angle as\nwell as its minimum permissible value that does not yet cause a considerable\nreduction of the gamma-gamma luminosity. It is shown that the best solution is\nto increase the laser wavelength from the current 1 \\mum (which is optimal for\n2E=500 GeV) to 2 \\mum as this makes possible achieving high gamma-gamma\nluminosities at a crossing angle of 20 mrad, which is also quite comfortable\nfor e+e- collisions, does not cause any degradation of the e+e- luminosity and\nopens the possibility for a more energetic future collider in the same tunnel\n(e.g., CLIC). Moreover, the 2 \\mum wavelength is optimal for a 2E = 1 TeV\ncollider, e.g., a possible ILC energy upgrade.

The satellites can make observations on the far side of\nthe Moon and then send back the data on the near side part of the orbit.\nHowever, for such array the traditional imaging algorithm is not applicable:\nthe field of view is very wide (almost whole sky), and for baselines\ndistributed on a plane, there is a mirror symmetry between the two sides of the\nplane. A further complication is that for each baseline, the Moon blocks part\nof the sky, but as the satellites orbit the Moon, both the direction of the\nbaseline and the blocked sky change, so even imaging algorithms which can deal\nwith non-coplanar baseline may not work in this case.

In order to increase the energy or reduce the size of the\naccelerator, new acceleration schemes need to be developed. Plasma wakefield\nacceleration, in which the electrons in a plasma are excited, leading to strong\nelectric fields, is one such promising novel acceleration technique. Pioneering\nexperiments have shown that an intense laser pulse or electron bunch traversing\na plasma, drives electric fields of 10s GV/m and above. These values are well\nbeyond those achieved in conventional RF accelerators which are limited to ~0.1\nGV/m. A limitation of laser pulses and electron bunches is their low stored\nenergy, which motivates the use of multiple stages to reach very high energies.\nThe use of proton bunches is compelling, as they have the potential to drive\nwakefields and accelerate electrons to high energy in a single accelerating\nstage. The long proton bunches currently available can be used, as they undergo\nself-modulation, a particle-plasma interaction which longitudinally splits the\nbunch into a series of high density microbunches, which then act resonantly to\ncreate large wakefields. The AWAKE experiment at CERN uses intense bunches of\nprotons, each of energy 400 GeV, with a total bunch energy of 19 kJ, to drive a\nwakefield in a 10 m long plasma. Bunches of electrons are injected into the\nwakefield formed by the proton microbunches. This paper presents measurements\nof electrons accelerated up to 2 GeV at AWAKE. This constitutes the first\ndemonstration of proton-driven plasma wakefield acceleration. The potential for\nthis scheme to produce very high energy electron bunches in a single\naccelerating stage means that the results shown here are a significant step\ntowards the development of future high energy particle accelerators. \n\n"}

In this work, we present an\neffective solution to this problem in the form of a robust likelihood designed\nto account for effects due to unknown foreground and target contaminations.\nConceptually, this robust likelihood marginalizes over the unknown large-scale\ncontamination amplitudes. We showcase the effectiveness of this novel\nlikelihood via an application to a mock SDSS-III data set subject to dust\nextinction contamination.

This program will begin with a\ncentral focus on high-precision and model-independent measurements of the Higgs\nboson couplings. This method of searching for new physics beyond the Standard\nModel is orthogonal to and complements the LHC physics program. The ILC at 250\nGeV will also search for direct new physics in exotic Higgs decays and in\npair-production of weakly interacting particles. Polarised electron and\npositron beams add unique opportunities to the physics reach. The ILC can be\nupgraded to higher energy, enabling precision studies of the top quark and\nmeasurement of the top Yukawa coupling and the Higgs self-coupling. The key\naccelerator technology, superconducting radio-frequency cavities, has matured.\nOptimised collider and detector designs, and associated physics analyses, were\npresented in the ILC Technical Design Report, signed by 2400 scientists. There\nis a strong interest in Japan to host this international effort. A detailed\nreview of the many aspects of the project is nearing a conclusion in Japan. Now\nthe Japanese government is preparing for a decision on the next phase of\ninternational negotiations, that could lead to a project start within a few\nyears.

Numerous\nsources for the EGRB have been proposed, but the two systems which are certain\nto make some contribution are active galaxies (blazars) as well as normal\ngalaxies. In this paper, we evaluate the contribution to the background from\nboth sources. The active galaxy contribution arises from unresolved blazars. We\ncompute this contribution using the Stecker-Salamon model. For normal galaxies,\nthe emission is due to cosmic-ray interactions with diffuse gas. Our key\nassumption here is that the cosmic-ray flux in a galaxy is proportional to the\nsupernova rate and thus the massive star formation rate, quantified\nobservationally by the cosmic star formation rate (CSFR). In addition, the\nexistence of stars today requires a considerably higher ISM mass in the past.\nUsing the CSFR to compute both these effects, we find that normal galaxies are\nresponsible for a significant portion (\\sim 1/3) of the EGRB near 1 GeV, but\nmake a smaller contribution at other energies. Finally, we present a \"minimal\"\ntwo-component model which includes contributions from both normal galaxies and\nblazars. We show that the spectrum of the diffuse radiation is a key constraint\non this model: while neither the blazar spectra, nor the galactic spectra, are\nseparately optimal fits to the observed spectrum, the combined emission\nprovides an excellent fit. We close by noting key observational tests of this\ntwo-component model, which can be probed by future gamma-ray observatories such\nas GLAST. \n\n"}

Both for\nensembles and individual orbits, as N increases there is a smooth convergence\ntowards a continuum limit.

Discreteness effects accelerate\nemittance growth for initially localised clumps. However, even allowing for\ndiscreteness effects one can distinguish between orbits which, in the continuum\nlimit, feel a regular potential, so that emittance grows as a power law in\ntime, and chaotic orbits, where emittance grows exponentially. For sufficiently\nlarge N, one can distinguish two different `kinds' of chaos. Short range\nmicrochaos, associated with close encounters between charges, is a generic\nfeature, yielding large positive Lyapunov exponents X_N which do not decrease\nwith increasing N even if the bulk potential is integrable.

The main advantage of this index\nis that it tends {\\it exponentially} to zero in the case of chaotic orbits,\nwhile it fluctuates around non--zero values in the case of quasiperiodic\ntrajectories. Thus, it avoids the notorious ambiguities concerning the eventual\nconvergence of (maximum) Lyapunov exponents to (positive) non-zero values.\nExploiting the different behavior of SALI in these two cases we produce phase\nspace `charts' where regions of chaos and order are clearly identified.\nEvaluating the percentage of chaotic and escaping orbits as a function of the\ndistance from the origin we are able to estimate rapidly and accurately the\nboundaries of the {\\it dynamical aperture} of a proton beam, passing repeatedly\nthrough an array of magnetic focusing elements. \n\n"}

{"id": "physics/9706003", "contents": "Title: Ultimate luminosities and energies of photon colliders Abstract: A photon collider luminosity and its energy are determined by the parameters\nof an electron-electron linear collider (energy, power, beam emittances) and\ncollision effects. The main collision effect is the coherent e+e- pair\ncreation. At low energies (2E < 0.5 - 1 TeV) this process is suppressed due to\nrepulsion of electron beams. In this region gamma-gamma luminosity above\n10^{35} cm-2 s-1 is possible (10^{33} is sufficient). At higher energies the\nlimited average beam power and coherent pair creation restrict the maximum\nenergy of photon colliders (with sufficient luminosity) at 2E ~ 5 TeV.\nObtaining high luminosities requires the development of new methods of\nproduction beams with low emittances such as a laser cooling. \n\n"}
{"id": "physics/9706035", "contents": "Title: Progress in Photon Colliders Abstract: Last two years were very important in history of a photon colliders. This\noption is included now in conceptual design reports of the NLC, JLC and\nTESLA/SBLC projects. All the designs foresee two interaction regions: one for\ne+e- and the second for gamma-gamma, gamma-e and e^-e^- collisions. This paper\nis focused on three aspects: 1) arguments for photon colliders; 2) parameters\nof current projects; 3) ultimate luminosities and energies, new ideas. Recent\nstudies have shown that the main collision effect - coherent pair creation - is\nsuppressed at photon colliders with the energy (2E < 2 TeV) due to the beam\nrepulsion, and one can achieve, in principle, the gamma-gamma luminosity\nexceeding 10^{35} cm^-2s^-1. The required electron beams with very small\nemittances can be obtained, for example, using a laser cooling of electron\nbeams. This new method requires a laser with a power by one order of magnitude\nhigher than that required for the ``conversion'' of electrons to photons. Such\nlasers are not available today, but hopefully they will appear by the time when\nlinear colliders will be built. High energy gamma-gamma, gamma-e colliders with\nthe luminosity comparable to that in e^+e^- collisions are beyond the\ncompetition in study of many phenomena of particle physics. \n\n"}

{"id": "quant-ph/0002048", "contents": "Title: The thermodynamic cost of reliability and low temperatures: Tightening\n  Landauer's principle and the Second Law Abstract: Landauer's principle states that the erasure of one bit of information\nrequires the free energy kT ln 2. We argue that the reliability of the bit\nerasure process is bounded by the accuracy inherent in the statistical state of\nthe energy source (`the resources') driving the process. We develop a general\nframework describing the `thermodynamic worth' of the resources with respect to\nreliable bit erasure or good cooling. This worth turns out to be given by the\ndistinguishability of the resource's state from its equilibrium state in the\nsense of a statistical inference problem. Accordingly, Kullback-Leibler\nrelative information is a decisive quantity for the `worth' of the resource's\nstate. Due to the asymmetry of relative information, the reliability of the\nerasure process is bounded rather by the relative information of the\nequilibrium state wit respect to the actual state than by the relative\ninformation of the actual state with respect to the equilibrium state (which is\nthe free energy up to constants). \n\n"}
