We also introduce the word-length\nasymmetry function for groups, which is an algebraic analogue of computational\nasymmetry.

It is a key\ningredient of the usual solutions to the conjugacy problem in braid groups. In\ntheir seminal paper on braid-cryptography, Ko, Lee et al. proposed the {\\it\ncycling problem} as a hard problem in braid groups that could be interesting\nfor cryptography. In this paper we give a polynomial solution to that problem,\nmainly by showing that cycling is surjective, and using a result by Maffre\nwhich shows that pre-images under cycling can be computed fast. This result\nalso holds in every Artin-Tits group of spherical type.\n  On the other hand, the conjugacy search problem in braid groups is usually\nsolved by computing some finite sets called (left) ultra summit sets\n(left-USS), using left normal forms of braids. But one can equally use right\nnormal forms and compute right-USS's. Hard instances of the conjugacy search\nproblem correspond to elements having big (left and right) USS's. One may think\nthat even if some element has a big left-USS, it could possibly have a small\nright-USS. We show that this is not the case in the important particular case\nof rigid braids. More precisely, we show that the left-USS and the right-USS of\na given rigid braid determine isomorphic graphs, with the arrows reversed, the\nisomorphism being defined using iterated cycling.

As a result, many large classes of 3-manifolds,\nincluding knot complements, are known to have left-orderable fundamental group.\nHowever, though the complement of a knot has left-orderable fundamental group,\nthe result of Dehn surgery is a closed 3-manifold that need not have this\nproperty. We take this as motivation for the study of left-orderability in the\ncontext of Dehn surgery, and establish a condition on peripheral elements that\nmust hold whenever a given Dehn surgery yields a manifold with left-orderable\nfundamental group.

In a similar way, symmetric spaces have been defined by Loos (Symmetric\nSpaces I, 1969) as spaces equipped with point reflections depending on a point\nand fixing this point; therefore the theories of Jordan geometries and of\nsymmetric spaces are closely related to each other -- in order to describe this\nlink, the notion of symmetry actions of torsors and of symmetric spaces is\nintroduced. Jordan geometries give rise both to symmetry actions of certain\nabelian torsors and of certain symmetric spaces, which in a sense are dual to\neach other.

Several longstanding conjectures that are\nstill open for arbitrary groups were settled in the case of sofic or\nhyperlinear groups. These achievements aroused the interest of an increasing\nnumber of researchers into some fundamental questions about the nature of these\napproximation properties. Many of such problems are to this day still open such\nas, outstandingly: Is there any countable discrete group that is not sofic or\nhyperlinear? A similar pattern can be found in the study of II_1 factors. In\nthis case the famous conjecture due to Connes (commonly known as the Connes\nembedding conjecture) that any II_1 factor can be approximated in a suitable\nsense by matrix algebras inspired several breakthroughs in the understanding of\nII_1 factors, and stands out today as one of the major open problems in the\nfield.

We define a semigroup $S$ of\nM\\\"obius transformations to be \\emph{semidiscrete} if the identity\ntransformation is not an accumulation point of $S$. We say that $S$ is\n\\emph{inverse free} if it does not contain the identity element. One of our\nmain results states that if $S$ is a semigroup generated by some finite\ncollection $\\mathcal{F}$ of M\\\"obius transformations, then $S$ is semidiscrete\nand inverse free if and only if every sequence of the form $F_n=f_1\\dotsb f_n$,\nwhere $f_n\\in\\mathcal{F}$, converges pointwise on the upper half-plane to a\npoint on the ideal boundary, where convergence is with respect to the chordal\nmetric on the extended complex plane.

Here we come to the notion of weak\nequivalence of gradings: two gradings are weakly equivalent if there exists an\nisomorphism between the graded algebras that maps each graded component onto a\ngraded component. The following question arises naturally: when a group grading\non a finite dimensional algebra is weakly equivalent to a grading by a finite\ngroup? It turns out that this question can be reformulated purely group\ntheoretically in terms of the universal group of the grading. Namely, a grading\nis weakly equivalent to a grading by a finite group if and only if the\nuniversal group of the grading is residually finite with respect to a special\nsubset of the grading group.

{"id": "1705.06219", "contents": "Title: Largest acylindrical actions and stability in hierarchically hyperbolic\n  groups Abstract: We consider two manifestations of non-positive curvature: acylindrical\nactions on hyperbolic spaces and quasigeodesic stability. We study these\nproperties for the class of hierarchically hyperbolic groups, which is a\ngeneral framework for studying many important families of groups, including\nmapping class groups, right-angled Coxeter and Artin groups, most 3-manifold\ngroups, and many others. A group that admits an acylindrical action on a\nhyperbolic space may admit many such actions on different hyperbolic spaces, so\nit is natural to search for a \"best\" one. The set of all cobounded acylindrical\nactions on hyperbolic spaces admits a natural poset structure; in this paper we\nprove that all hierarchically hyperbolic groups admit a unique action which is\nthe largest in this poset. The action we construct is also universal in the\nsense that every element which acts loxodromically in some acylindrical action\non a hyperbolic space does so in this one. Special cases of this result are\nthemselves new and interesting. For instance, this is the first proof that\nright-angled Coxeter groups admit universal acylindrical actions. The notion of\nquasigeodesic stability of subgroups provides a natural analogue of\nquasiconvexity outside the context of hyperbolic groups. We provide a complete\nclassification of stable subgroups of hierarchically hyperbolic groups,\ngeneralizing and extending results that are known for mapping class groups and\nright-angled Artin groups. We also provide a characterization of contracting\nquasigeodesics; interestingly, in this generality the proof is much simpler\nthan in the special cases where it was already known. In the appendix, it is\nverified that any space satisfying the a priori weaker property of being an\n\"almost hierarchically hyperbolic space\" is actually a hierarchically\nhyperbolic space. The results of the appendix are used to streamline the proofs\nin the main text. \n\n"}

Such a group is called special if the center lies within its\nderived group. Every group of class 2 and exponent $p$ can be uniquely\nexpressed as the direct product of an elementary abelian group and a special\ngroup. This reduces the isomorphism problem to special groups. The special\ngroups having $G'$ cyclic are well known. Groups having $|G'|=p^2$ are known to\nbe generated by two abelian subgroups. As such, they can be described by a pair\nof Scharlau Matrices which we will define. Using these, Vishnevetskii ([1],\n[2]) classified the special groups which are not central products of groups of\nsmaller order. We call these Vishnevetskii indecomposable. All decomposable\ngroups are central products of two or more indecomposable groups. By Theorem 2\nof [2], if $G$ is a special group with derived group of order $p^2$ then the\nindecomposable central factors of $G$, together with their multiplicities, form\na set of invariants for $G$. However these invariants do not determine $G$,\nsince (as we will show below) two nonisomorphic groups can have the same\nindecomposable central factors.

We show that for a large class of discrete groups, this property of\nnil-rigidity holds for all expansive actions that satisfy a natural\nspecification-like property and have dense homoclinic points.
