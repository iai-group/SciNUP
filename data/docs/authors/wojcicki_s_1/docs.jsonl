It is based on a microscopic model for pion production\noff the nucleon that, besides the dominant Delta pole contribution, takes into\naccount the effect of background terms required by chiral symmetry. Moreover,\nthe model uses a reduced nucleon-to-Delta resonance axial coupling, which leads\nto coherent pion production cross sections around a factor two smaller than\nmost of the previous theoretical estimates. In the coherent production, the\nmain nuclear effects, namely medium corrections on the Delta propagator and the\nfinal pion distortion, are included. We have improved on previous similar\nmodels by taking into account the nucleon motion and employing a more\nsophisticated optical potential. As found in previous calculations the\nmodification of the Delta self-energy inside the nuclear medium strongly\nreduces the cross section, while the final pion distortion mainly shifts the\npeak position to lower pion energies. The angular distribution profiles are not\nmuch affected by nuclear effects. Nucleon motion increases the cross section by\n15% at neutrino energies of 650 MeV, while Coulomb effects on charged pions are\nestimated to be small.

I consider here the implications of the\nheavier composition on the sources of UHECRs. The smaller magnetic rigidity\nimplies that nuclei UHECRs are: (i) More easily accelerated (ii) Local, as they\ncan diffuse only a few Mpc from their sources before disintegrating (iii)\nIsotropic, because large deflections in the extra galactic and the galactic\nmagnetic fields erase the directional information. Uncertainties in the\nstrength and structure of the the extra galactic magnetic field (EGMF) makes it\ndifficult to estimate the overall effects. However, with typical reasonable\nparameters of a few nG and a coherence distance of a Mpc the distance a nuclei\nUHECR above the GZK energy traverses before photodisintegrating is only a few\nMpc. In spite of the significantly weaker limits on the luminosity, Cen A is\nthe only currently active potential source of nuclei UHECRs within this\ndistance. The large deflections erases the directional anisotropy expected from\na single source.

Typical cosmic ray\nenergies may be much higher than the ~ 1 GeV flux which normally dominates.\nThese high-energy particles strike the Earth's atmosphere initiating an\nextensive air shower. As the air shower propagates deeper, it ionizes the\natmosphere by producing charged secondary particles. Secondary particles such\nas muons and thermal neutrons produced as a result of nuclear interactions are\nable to reach the ground, enhancing the radiation dose. Muons contribute 85% to\nthe radiation dose from cosmic rays. This enhanced dose could be potentially\nharmful to the biosphere. This mechanism has been discussed extensively in\nliterature but has never been quantified. Here, we have developed a lookup\ntable that can be used to quantify this effect by modeling terrestrial muon\nflux from any arbitrary cosmic ray spectra with 10 GeV - 1 PeV primaries.

These are the constrained MSSM (CMSSM), non-universal\nHiggs masses models (NUHM1, NUHM2), non-universal gaugino masses model (NUGM)\nand GUT related gaugino masses models (NUGMd). Two definitions of the fine\ntuning are used, the first (Delta_{max}) measures maximal fine-tuning wrt\nindividual parameters while the second (Delta_q) adds their contribution in\n\"quadrature\". As a direct result of two theoretical constraints (the EW minimum\nconditions), fine tuning (Delta_q) emerges as a suppressing factor (effective\nprior) of the averaged likelihood (under the priors), under the integral of the\nglobal probability of measuring the data (Bayesian evidence p(D)). For each\nmodel, there is little difference between Delta_q, Delta_{max} in the region\nallowed by the data, with similar behaviour as functions of the Higgs, gluino,\nstop mass or SUSY scale (m_{susy}=(m_{\\tilde t_1} m_{\\tilde t_2})^{1/2}) or\ndark matter and g-2 constraints. The analysis has the advantage that by\nreplacing any of these mass scales or constraints by their latest bounds one\neasily infers for each model the value of Delta_q, Delta_{max} or vice versa.\nFor all models, minimal fine tuning is achieved for M_{higgs} near 115 GeV with\na Delta_q\\approx Delta_{max}\\approx 10 to 100 depending on the model, and in\nthe CMSSM this is actually a global minimum. Due to a strong ($\\approx$\nexponential) dependence of Delta on M_{higgs}, for a Higgs mass near 125 GeV,\nthe above values of Delta_q\\approx Delta_{max} increase to between 500 and\n1000. Possible corrections to these values are briefly discussed. \n\n"}

Single pi0 studies have indicated a large potential for\nimprovement in the energy resolution of pi0's, typically reducing the average\nenergy resolution by a factor of two for 4 GeV pi0's.

This discrepancy has led to various, quite different\nexplanations in terms of increased axial masses, changes in the functional form\nof the axial form factor, increased vector strength in nuclei, and initial\ntwo-particle interactions. This is disconcerting since the neutrino energy\nreconstruction depends on the reaction mechanism. Purpose: We investigate\nwhether exclusive observables, such as nucleon knock-out, can be used to\ndistinguish between the various proposed reaction mechanisms. We determine the\ninfluence of 2p-2h excitations on the energy reconstruction. Method: We use the\nGiessen Boltzmann--Uehling--Uhlenbeck (GiBUU) model to predict numbers and\nspectra of knock-out nucleons. The model is extended by incorporating a simple,\nbut realistic treatment of initial 2p-2h excitations. Results: We show numbers\nand spectra of knock-out nucleons and show their sensitivity to the presence of\n2p-2h initial excitations. We also discuss the influence of 2p-2h excitations\non the neutrino energy reconstruction. Conclusions: 2p-2h excitations do lead\nto an increase in the number $n$ of knock-out nucleons for $n \\ge 2$ while only\nthe $n=1$ knock-out remains a clean signal of true QE scattering. The spectra\nof knock-out nucleons do also change, but their qualitative shape remains as\nbefore.

It is shown, that fake QE-like\nevents lead to significant distortions in neutrino energy reconstruction.\nFlux-folded and unfolded cross sections for QE-like scattering are calculated\nas functions of both true and reconstructed energies. Flux-folded momentum\ntransfer distributions are calculated as functions of both true and\nreconstructed momentum transfer.

First, we consider\nBR(Bs->\\mu\\mu), which has recently been for the first time measured by LHCb. In\nthe CMSSM we show that ultimate, but realistic, improvement in the\ndetermination of the observable to about 5-10% around the Standard Model value\nwould strongly disfavor the A-funnel region, while not affecting much the other\nfavored regions. Second, we show that all the favored regions of the CMSSM will\nbe, for the most part, sensitive to direct dark matter searches in future\none-tonne detectors. A signal at low WIMP mass (<=450 GeV) and low\nspin-independent cross section would then strongly favor the stau\ncoannihilation region while a signal at higher WIMP mass (~800 GeV to ~1.2 TeV)\nwould clearly point to the region where the neutralino is higgsino-like with\nmass ~1 TeV. A nearly complete experimental testing of the CMSSM over multi-TeV\nranges of superpartner masses, far beyond the reach of direct SUSY searches at\nthe LHC, can therefore be achievable. In the NUHM, in contrast, similar favored\nregions exist but a sample study reveals that even a precise determination of\nBR(Bs->\\mu\\mu) would have a much less constraining power on the model,\nincluding the A-funnel region.

For a $\\bar{K}N (I=0)$ bound state without\ncouplings to other channels, we establish a relation between the radiative\ndecay width and the compositeness. Especially the radiative decay width of the\nbound state is proportional to the compositeness. Applying the formulation to\n$\\Lambda (1405)$, we observe that the decay to $\\Lambda \\gamma$ is dominated by\nthe $K^{-}p$ component inside $\\Lambda (1405)$, because in this decay $\\pi ^{+}\n\\Sigma ^{-}$ and $\\pi ^{-} \\Sigma ^{+}$ strongly cancel each other and the $\\pi\n\\Sigma$ component can contribute to the $\\Lambda \\gamma$ decay only through the\nslight isospin breaking.

We develop exact expressions for the Fisher matrix elements\nrequired to compute the Cramer-Rao bound in the case of a source with a\nGaussian light profile. From these expressions we predict the behavior of the\nCramer-Rao astrometric and photometric precision as a function of the signal\nand the noise of the observations, and compare them to actual observations -\nfinding a good correspondence between them.\n  We show that the astrometric Cramer-Rao bound goes as $(S/N)^{-1}$ (similar\nto the photometric bound) but, additionally, we find that this bound is quite\nsensitive to the value of the background - suppressing the background can\ngreatly enhance the astrometric accuracy.\n  We present a systematic analysis of the elements of the Fisher matrix in the\ncase when the detector adequately samples the source (oversampling regime),\nleading to closed-form analytical expressions for the Cramer-Rao bound.

MS is also the dominating source for\nhit confusion and track uncertainties in low energy precision experiments. In\nall such environments, where MS dominates, track reconstruction and fitting can\nbe largely simplified by using three-dimensional (3D) hit-triplets as provided\nby pixel detectors. This simplification is possible since track uncertainties\nare solely determined by MS if high precision spatial information is provided.\nFitting of hit-triplets is especially simple for tracking detectors in\nsolenoidal magnetic fields.

As the momentum of the muon increases,\nthe contrast of the image goes down and therefore requires higher resolution in\nthe muon spectrometer to resolve the image.

The out-of-equilibrium description\nof strongly interacting relativistic fields is based on the theory of Kadanoff\nand Baym. For the modeling of the partonic phase we introduce a dynamical\nquasiparticle model (DQPM) for QCD in equilibrium. The widths and masses of the\nquasiparticles are controlled by transport coefficients in comparison to\nlattice QCD results. The resulting off-shell transport approach - denoted by\nParton-Hadron-String Dynamics (PHSD) - also includes covariant dynamical\nhadronization and keeps track of the hadronic interactions in the final phase.\nWe show that PHSD captures the bulk dynamics of heavy-ion collisions from SPS\nto LHC energies and provides a basis for the evaluation of the electromagnetic\nemissivity, using the same dynamical parton propagators as for the system\nevolution. Direct photon production in elementary processes and heavy-ion\nreactions at RHIC and LHC energies is investigated and the status of the photon\nv2 puzzle - a large elliptic flow of the direct photons observed in A+A\ncollisions - is addressed.

{"id": "1602.08816", "contents": "Title: Asymmetric Dark Matter Bound State Abstract: We propose an interesting framework for asymmetric scalar dark matter (ADM),\nwhich has novel collider phenomenology in terms of an unstable ADM bound state\n(ADMonium) produced via Higgs portals. ADMonium is a natural consequence of the\nbasic features of ADM: the (complex scalar) ADM is charged under a dark local\n$U(1)_d$ symmetry which is broken at a low scale and provides a light gauge\nboson $X$. The dark gauge coupling is strong and then ADM can annihilate away\ninto $X$-pair effectively. Therefore, the ADM can form bound state due to its\nlarge self-interaction via $X$ mediation. To explore the collider signature of\nADMonium, we propose that ADM has a two-Higgs doublet portal. The ADMonium can\nhave a sizable mixing with the heavier Higgs boson, which admits a large cross\nsection of ADMonium production associated with $b\\bar b$. The resulting\nsignature at the LHC depends on the decays of $X$.

The creation mechanism makes the vector bosons' energy spectral\ndensity $\\rho_{cdm}/\\Delta E$ very high. Therefore, the dark electric dipole\ntransition rate in atoms is boosted if the energy gap between atomic states\nequals the mass of the vector bosons. By using the Zeeman effect, the energy\ngap between the 2S state and the 2P state in hydrogen atoms or hydrogen like\nions can be tuned. The $2S$ state can be populated with electrons due to its\nrelatively long life, which is about $1/7$s. When the energy gap between the\nsemi-ground $2S$ state and the 2P state matches the mass of the cosmic vector\nbosons, induced transitions occur and the 2P state subsequently decays into the\n1S state. The $2P\\to1S$ decay emitted Lyman-$\\alpha$ photons can then be\nregistered. The choices of target atoms depend on the experimental facilities\nand the mass ranges of the vector bosons. Because the mass of the vector boson\nis connected to the inflation scale, the proposed experiment may provide a\nprobe to inflation. \n\n"}

For these analyses, signatures that mimic such leptons\npresent a `fake lepton' background that must be estimated. Since the magnitude\nof this background depends strongly upon details of the detector response, it\ncan be difficult to estimate with simulation. One data-driven approach is the\n`matrix method', in which two categories of leptons are defined (`loose' and\n`tight'), with the tight category being a subset of the loose category. Using\nthe populations of leptons in each category in the analysis sample, and the\nefficiencies for both real and fake leptons in the loose category to satisfy\nthe criteria for the tight category, the fake background yield can be\nestimated. This paper describes a Poisson likelihood implementation of the\nmatrix method, which provides a more precise, reliable, and robust estimate of\nthe fake background yield compared to an analytic solution.

In addition if\nneutralino is the dark matter, its relic density puts further constraints on\nmodels often requiring coannihilation to reduce the neutralino relic density to\nbe consistent with experimental observation. The coannihilation in turn implies\nthat the mass gap between the LSP and the NLSP will be small leading to softer\nfinal states and making the observation of supersymmetry challenging. In this\nwork we investigate stau coannihilation models within supergravity grand\nunified models and the potential of discovery of such models at the LHC in the\npost Higgs boson discovery era.

The QCD corrections are found to be rather modest at lower\ncenter-of-mass energy range ($\\sqrt{s}<300$ GeV), thus of negligible impact on\nHiggs factory such as CEPC. Nevertheless, when the energy is boosted to the ILC\nenergy range ($\\sqrt{s}\\approx 400$ GeV), QCD corrections may enhance the\nleading-order cross section by $20\\%$. In any event, the $e^+e^-\\to H\\gamma$\nprocess has a maximal production rate $\\sigma_{\\rm max}\\approx 0.08$ fb around\n$\\sqrt{s}= 250$ GeV, thus CEPC turns out to be the best place to look for this\nrare Higgs production process. In the high energy limit, the effect of NLO QCD\ncorrections become completely negligible, which can be simply attributed to the\ndifferent asymptotic scaling behaviors of the LO and NLO cross sections, where\nthe former exhibits a milder decrement $\\propto 1/s$ , but the latter undergoes\na much faster decrease $\\propto 1/s^2$. \n\n"}

Abstract: A hypothesis is proposed to explain the long-standing DAMA/LIBRA puzzle.\nIntroduced into the DAMA/LIBRA shielding is a purge gas of nominally\nhigh-purity nitrogen, which under this hypothesis contains argon impurities.\nArgon is introduced into the nitrogen purge gas either through leaks in the\npurge gas plumbing, or through commercially-supplied bottled nitrogen, diffuses\nthrough materials in the detector housings, and then comes in direct contact\nwith the DAMA/LIBRA detectors. These argon impurities can then lead to a\nmodulating 2.8 keV background under two scenarios. Scenario 1): These\nimpurities include the isotope 37Ar, which decays by electron capture, emitting\na 2.8 keV x-ray. These decays appear as single-site, monoenergetic events in\nDAMA/LIBRA, and produce an annual modulation due to the variation of neutron\nflux in the atmosphere and at the Earth's surface, which in turn leads to a\nseasonal variation in 37Ar production from the reactions\n$^{40}\\textrm{Ca}(\\textrm{n,}\\alpha)^{37}\\textrm{Ar}$ and\n$^{36}\\textrm{Ar}(\\textrm{n,}\\gamma)^{37}\\textrm{Ar}$. Scenario 2): Radon is\nalso in the DAMA/LIBRA purge gas, modulating seasonally at a rate below the\ncurrent DAMA/LIBRA limits. When radon or its short-lived daughters decay, the\nresulting beta, gamma, and bremsstrahlung radiation cause stable 40Ar to be\nionized within the copper housings surrounding the NaI(Tl) detectors, resulting\nin characteristic 2.8 keV x-rays. Modulating backgrounds might also result from\nradon-induced neutron or gamma-ray flux from the surrounding cavern, leading to\na small modulating background enhanced at low energy by the presence of 40Ar\nwithin the copper housings. These two scenarios are straightforward to test\nthrough assay of the purge gas as well as Monte Carlo and laboratory study of\nthe DAMA/LIBRA copper housings when excited by ionizing radiation. \n\n"}

They are the S3, U3 and U1 leptoquarks (LQs), and a triplet of\nSM-like vector bosons (VBs). Under the theoretical assumption that the NP\ncouples predominantly to the third generation, previous analyses found that,\nwhen constraints from other processes are taken into account, the S3, U3 and VB\nmodels cannot explain the B anomalies, but U1 is viable. In this paper, we\nreanalyze these models, but without any assumption about their couplings. We\nfind that, even in this most general case, S3 and U3 are excluded.

Such devices exploit the coupling between axions and electrons in\nthe form of collective spin excitations of magnetic materials with the readout\nthrough a microwave cavity.

The two\ndetectors are separated on average by 1200 m of rock, and located at a\nrespective zenith angle of about 30 degrees. The energy threshold at the\nsurface for muons reaching the MACRO depth is approximately 1.3 TeV. Such muons\nare produced in the early stages of the shower development and in a kinematic\nregion quite different from the one relevant for the usual Nmu-Ne studies. The\nmeasurement leads to a primary composition becoming heavier at the knee of the\nprimary spectrum, the knee itself resulting from the steepening of the spectrum\nof a primary light component (p, He). The result confirms the ones reported\nfrom the observation of the low energy muons at the surface (typically in the\nGeV energy range), showing that the conclusions do not depend on the production\nregion kinematics. Thus, the hadronic interaction model used (CORSIKA/QGSJET)\nprovides consistent composition results from data related to secondaries\nproduced in a rapidity region exceeding the central one. Such an evolution of\nthe composition in the knee region supports the \"standard\" galactic\nacceleration/propagation models that imply rigidity dependent breaks of the\ndifferent components, and therefore breaks occurring at lower energies in the\nspectra of the light nuclei. \n\n"}

Black hole production in the scattering of\nultrahigh energy cosmic neutrinos on nucleons in the atmosphere may initiate\nquasi-horizontal air showers far above the Standard Model rate. In this letter,\nwe compare the sensitivity of LHC and Auger to black hole production by\nstudying their respective reach in black hole production parameter space.\nMoreover, we present constraints in this parameter space from the\nnon-observation of horizontal showers by the Fly's Eye collaboration.

{"id": "nucl-th/0606058", "contents": "Title: Neutral current neutrino-nucleus interactions at intermediate energies Abstract: We have extended our model for charged current neutrino-nucleus interactions\nto neutral current reactions. For the elementary neutrino-nucleon interaction,\nwe take into account quasielastic scattering, Delta excitation and the\nexcitation of the resonances in the second resonance region. Our model for the\nneutrino-nucleus collisions includes in-medium effects such as Fermi motion,\nPauli blocking, nuclear binding, and final-state interactions. They are\nimplemented by means of the Giessen Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (GiBUU)\ncoupled-channel transport model. This allows us to study exclusive channels,\nnamely pion production and nucleon knockout. We find that final-state\ninteractions modify considerably the distributions through rescattering,\ncharge-exchange and absorption. Side-feeding induced by charge-exchange\nscattering is important in both cases. In the case of pions, there is a strong\nabsorption associated with the in-medium pionless decay modes of the Delta,\nwhile nucleon knockout exhibits a considerable enhancement of low energy\nnucleons due to rescattering. At neutrino energies above 1 GeV, we also obtain\nthat the contribution to nucleon knockout from Delta excitation is comparable\nto that from quasielastic scattering. \n\n"}
