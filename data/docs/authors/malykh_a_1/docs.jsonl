{"id": "0704.2612", "contents": "Title: Relativistic Effects in Extreme Mass Ratio Gravitational Wave Bursts Abstract: Extreme mass ratio bursts (EMRBs) have been proposed as a possible source for\nfuture space-borne gravitational wave detectors, such as the Laser\nInterferometer Space Antenna (LISA). These events are characterized by\nlong-period, nearly-radial orbits of compact objects around a central massive\nblack hole. The gravitational radiation emitted during such events consists of\na short burst, corresponding to periapse passage, followed by a longer, silent\ninterval. In this paper we investigate the impact of including relativistic\ncorrections to the description of the compact object's trajectory via a\ngeodesic treatment, as well as including higher-order multipole corrections in\nthe waveform calculation. The degree to which the relativistic corrections are\nimportant depends on the EMRB's orbital parameters. We find that relativistic\nEMRBs (v_{max}}/c > 0.25) are not rare and actually account for approximately\nhalf of the events in our astrophysical model. The relativistic corrections\ntend to significantly change the waveform amplitude and phase relative to a\nNewtonian description, although some of this dephasing could be mimicked by\nparameter errors. The dephasing over several bursts could be of particular\nimportance not only to gravitational wave detection, but also to parameter\nestimation, since it is highly correlated to the spin of the massive black\nhole. Consequently, we postulate that if a relativistic EMRB is detected, such\ndephasing might be used to probe the relativistic character of the massive\nblack hole and obtain information about its spin. \n\n"}

Suitable corrections have to be introduced when the\naccretion rate approaches or exceeds the Eddington limit. We summarize\nphenomenological models that can explain the very high state, with apparently\nhigher disk temperatures and lower inner-disk radii. Conversely, ultraluminous\nX-ray sources often contain cooler disks with large characteristic radii. We\nintroduce another phenomenological model for this accretion state. We argue\nthat a standard disk dominates the radiative output for radii larger than a\ncharacteristic transition radius R_c ~ mdot x R_{ISCO}, where mdot is the\naccretion rate in Eddington units and R_{ISCO} is the innermost stable orbit.\nFor R_{ISCO} < R < R_c, most of the accretion power is released via non-thermal\nprocesses. We predict the location of such sources in a luminosity-temperature\nplot.

Moreover,\nwhile the observed clusters display an average ellipticity profile that does\nnot vary significantly with radius, the ellipticity of the relaxed CDM clusters\ndeclines markedly with increasing radius, suggesting that the ICM of the\nobserved clusters rotates less rapidly than that of the relaxed CDM clusters\nout to ~ 0.6 r_500.

Such spectra gain importance due to the fact\nthat they can lead to a better fit of the observed Cosmic Microwave Background\n(CMB) anisotropies, when compared to the conventional, featureless, power law\nspectrum. In this paper, with examples from the canonical scalar field as well\nas the tachyonic models, we illustrate that, in punctuated inflation, a drop in\nthe scalar power on large scales is {\\it always} accompanied by a rise in the\ntensor power and, hence, an even more pronounced increase in the\ntensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ on these scales.

We investigate possible signatures of this theory in the gravitational wave\nemission produced in the inspiral of stellar compact objects into massive black\nholes, both for intermediate- and extreme-mass ratios. We use the\nsemi-relativistic approximation, where the trajectories are geodesics of the\nmassive black hole geometry and the gravitational waveforms are obtained from a\nmultipolar decomposition of the radiative field.

Transverse positions vary randomly about\nclassical geodesics in space and time by about the geometric mean of the Planck\nscale and separation, on a timescale corresponding to their separation. An\neffective theory based on a Planck information flux limit, and normalized by\nthe black hole entropy formula, is developed to predict measurable\ncorrelations, such as the statistical properties of noise in interferometer\nsignals. A connection with holographic unification is illustrated by\nrepresenting Matrix theory position operators with a Schr\\\"odinger wave\nequation, interpreted as a paraxial wave equation with a Planck frequency\ncarrier.

The multi-loop\namplitude prescription for the minimal pure spinor superstring formulated in\nhep-th/0406055 involves the insertion of picture changing operators in the path\nintegral. These operators are BRST closed in a distributional sense and depend\non a number of constant tensors. One can trace the origin of these insertions\nto gauge fixing, so the amplitudes are formally independent of the constant\ntensors. We show however by explicit tree-level and one-loop computations that\nthe picture changing operators are not BRST closed inside correlators and the\namplitudes do depend on these constant tensors. This is due to the fact that\nthe gauge fixing condition implicit in the existing minimal amplitude\nprescription is singular and this can lead to Lorentz violation and\nnon-decoupling of BRST exact states. As discussed in hep-th/0406055, a\nmanifestly Lorentz invariant prescription can be obtained by integrating over\nthe constant tensors and in the sequel to this paper, it is shown that when one\nincludes these integrations unphysical states do decouple to all orders despite\nthe fact that the PCO's are not BRST closed inside correlators. \n\n"}

However, due to the\nlong-range nature of the van der Waals interaction between two colliding\nultracold atoms, the p-wave scattering amplitude of the two atoms is not\ndescribed by the effective-range theory. In this paper we provide an explicit\ncalculation for the p-wave scattering of two ultracold atoms near the p-wave\nmagnetic Feshbach resonance (PMFR). We show that the low energy p-wave\nscattering amplitude in the presence of PMFR takes the form\n$f_1(k)=-1/[ik+1/(\\mathcal{V}^{\\mathrm{eff}}k^2)+1/(\\mathcal{S}^{\\mathrm{eff}%}k)+1/\\mathcal{R}^{\\mathrm{eff}}]$\nwhere $\\mathcal{V}^{\\mathrm{eff}},$ $% \\mathcal{S}^{\\mathrm{eff}}$ and\n$\\mathcal{R}^{\\mathrm{eff}}$ are $k$% -dependent parameters.

Also,\nif kappa is characterizable by a dense linear ordering with an increasing\nsequence of size kappa, then 2^kappa is characterizable. We show that if kappa\nis homogeneously characterizable, then kappa is characterizable by a dense\nlinear ordering, while the converse fails.\n  The main theorems are: 1) If kappa>2^lambda is a characterizable cardinal,\nlambda is characterizable by a dense linear ordering and lambda is the least\ncardinal such that kappa^lambda>kappa, then kappa^lambda is also\ncharacterizable, 2) if aleph_alpha and kappa^(aleph_alpha) are characterizable\ncardinals, then the same is true for kappa^(aleph_(alpha+beta)), for all\ncountable beta.

Our theory accounts for the wide range of\nrelaxation rates observed in both structural glasses and soft glassy materials\nsuch as colloidal suspensions.

This virial state is a consequence of the low gas fractions within\nthe subclusters, caused by the accretion of gas onto the stars and the\naccretion-induced shrinkage of the subclusters. Because the subclusters are\ngas-poor, up to a length scale of 0.1-0.2 pc at the end of the simulation, they\nare only weakly affected by gas expulsion. The fraction of subclusters that\nreaches the high density required to evolve to a gas-poor state increases with\nthe density of the star-forming region.

Collective cavity\ncooling of molecules is a promising method that does not rely on molecular\nenergy level and thus can be applied to all molecules in principle. However,\nthe initial lack of cold molecules leads to the difficulty in its experimental\nimplementation. We show that efficient collective sympathetic cooling of\nmolecules to sub-mK temperatures using a large ensemble of atoms within a\ncavity is feasible. This approach is a new type of sympathetic cooling which\ndoes not rely on direct collisions between atoms and molecules, but utilizes\nthermalization via their mutual interaction with a cavity field.

This include: (1) giant enhancement of cavity\noptical field from the efficient scattering of the pump light by the atoms; (2)\ncavity-mediated collective interaction between the atoms and the molecules.

We propose a simple test\nstatistic based on lasso fitted values, called the covariance test statistic,\nand show that when the true model is linear, this statistic has an\n$\\operatorname {Exp}(1)$ asymptotic distribution under the null hypothesis (the\nnull being that all truly active variables are contained in the current lasso\nmodel). Our proof of this result for the special case of the first predictor to\nenter the model (i.e., testing for a single significant predictor variable\nagainst the global null) requires only weak assumptions on the predictor matrix\n$X$. On the other hand, our proof for a general step in the lasso path places\nfurther technical assumptions on $X$ and the generative model, but still allows\nfor the important high-dimensional case $p>n$, and does not necessarily require\nthat the current lasso model achieves perfect recovery of the truly active\nvariables. Of course, for testing the significance of an additional variable\nbetween two nested linear models, one typically uses the chi-squared test,\ncomparing the drop in residual sum of squares (RSS) to a $\\chi^2_1$\ndistribution. But when this additional variable is not fixed, and has been\nchosen adaptively or greedily, this test is no longer appropriate: adaptivity\nmakes the drop in RSS stochastically much larger than $\\chi^2_1$ under the null\nhypothesis. Our analysis explicitly accounts for adaptivity, as it must, since\nthe lasso builds an adaptive sequence of linear models as the tuning parameter\n$\\lambda$ decreases. In this analysis, shrinkage plays a key role: though\nadditional variables are chosen adaptively, the coefficients of lasso active\nvariables are shrunken due to the $\\ell_1$ penalty. Therefore, the test\nstatistic (which is based on lasso fitted values) is in a sense balanced by\nthese two opposing properties - adaptivity and shrinkage - and its null\ndistribution is tractable and asymptotically $\\operatorname {Exp}(1)$. \n\n"}

In atomic systems, where interactions\nrequire wave function overlap, effective spin interactions on a lattice can be\nrealized via superexchange; however, the coupling is weak and limited to\nnearest-neighbor interactions. In contrast, dipolar interactions exist in the\nabsence of tunneling and extend beyond nearest neighbors. This allows coherent\nspin dynamics to persist even at high entropy and low lattice filling. Effects\nof dipolar interactions in ultracold molecular gases have so far been limited\nto the modification of chemical reactions. We now report the observation of\ndipolar interactions of polar molecules pinned in a 3D optical lattice. We\nrealize a lattice spin model with spin encoded in rotational states, prepared\nand probed by microwaves. This spin-exchange interaction arises from the\nresonant exchange of rotational angular momentum between two molecules.

We describe a tailored experimental system\nused to produce and study Rydberg-interacting atoms excited from dense\nultracold atomic gases. The experiment has been optimized for fast duty cycles\nusing a high flux cold atom source and a three beam optical dipole trap. The\nlatter enables tuning of the atomic density and temperature over several orders\nof magnitude, all the way to the Bose-Einstein condensation transition. An\nelectrode structure surrounding the atoms allows for precise control over\nelectric fields and single-particle sensitive field ionization detection of\nRydberg atoms. We review two experiments which highlight the influence of\nstrong Rydberg--Rydberg interactions on different many-body systems.

In\npractice, it is infeasible for anyone but the owner of the network (if\nexistent) to monitor all nodes at all times. In this work we study the\nconstrained setting when the observer can only probe a small set of nodes at\neach time step to check whether new pieces of information (items) have reached\nthose nodes.\n  We formally define the problem through an infinite time generating process\nthat places new items in subsets of nodes according to an unknown probability\ndistribution.

The observer uses a probing schedule (i.e., a probability\ndistribution over the set of nodes) to choose, at each time step, a small set\nof nodes to check for new items. The goal is to compute a schedule that\nminimizes the average novelty of undetected items.

However, many factors can significantly\nimpact their late-time cosmological abundances. For example, in cases where the\npotentials for these fields are generated dynamically --- such as during\ncosmological mass-generating phase transitions --- the duration of the time\ninterval required for these potentials to fully develop can have significant\nrepercussions. Likewise, in scenarios with multiple scalars, mixing amongst the\nfields can also give rise to an effective timescale that modifies the resulting\nlate-time abundances. Previous studies have focused on the effects of either\nthe first or the second timescale in isolation. In this paper, by contrast, we\nexamine the new features that arise from the interplay between these two\ntimescales when both mixing and time-dependent phase transitions are introduced\ntogether. First, we find that the effects of these timescales can conspire to\nalter not only the total late-time abundance of the system --- often by many\norders of magnitude --- but also its distribution across the different fields.\nSecond, we find that these effects can produce large parametric resonances\nwhich render the energy densities of the fields highly sensitive to the degree\nof mixing as well as the duration of the time interval over which the phase\ntransition unfolds. Finally, we find that these effects can even give rise to a\n\"re-overdamping\" phenomenon which causes the total energy density of the system\nto behave in novel ways that differ from those exhibited by pure dark matter or\nvacuum energy. All of these features therefore give rise to new possibilities\nfor early-universe phenomenology and cosmological evolution.

Motivation, methodology\n  and first results from SALT Abstract: The black holes (BH) in merging BH-BH binaries are likely progeny of binary O\nstars. Their properties, including their spins, will be strongly influenced by\nthe evolution of their progenitor O stars. The remarkable observation that many\nsingle O stars spin very rapidly can be explained if they accreted angular\nmomentum from a mass-transferring, O-type or Wolf-Rayet companion before that\nstar blew up as a supernova. To test this prediction, we have measured the spin\nrates of eight O stars in Wolf-Rayet (WR) + O binaries, increasing the total\nsample size of such O stars' measured spins from two to ten. Polarimetric and\nother determinations of these systems' sin i allow us to determine an average\nequatorial rotation velocity from HeI (HeII) lines of $v_e$ = 348 (173) km/s\nfor these O stars, with individual star's $v_e$ from HeI (HeII) lines ranging\nfrom 482 (237) to 290 (91) km/s. We argue that the $\\sim$ 100\\% difference\nbetween HeI and HeII speeds is due to gravity darkening. Super-synchronous\nspins, now observed in all 10 O stars in WR + O binaries where it has been\nmeasured, are strong observational evidence that Roche lobe overflow mass\ntransfer from a WR progenitor companion has played a critical role in the\nevolution of WR+OB binaries. While theory predicts that this mass transfer\nrapidly spins-up the O-type mass gainer to a nearly break-up rotational\nvelocity $v_e \\sim 530 $ km/s, the observed average $v_e$ of the O-type stars\nin our sample is 65\\% that speed. This demonstrates that, even over the\nrelatively short WR-phase timescale, tidal and/or other effects causing\nrotational spin-down must be efficient. A challenge to tidal synchronization\ntheory is that the two longest-period binaries in our sample (with periods of\n29.7 and 78.5 days) unexpectedly display super-synchronous rotation. \n\n"}

Acting by these operators on the first Hamiltonian operator $J_0$ we\nobtain second and third Hamiltonian operators. However, we were not able to\nfind Hamiltonian densities corresponding to the latter two operators.\nTherefore, we construct two recursion operators, which are either even or odd,\nrespectively, under the above-mentioned discrete symmetry.

Here we\nreview the nonlinear and collective dynamics in a periodically modulated\nmagneto-optically trapped cold atoms. By temporally modulating the intensity of\nthe trapping lasers with the controlled phases, one can realize two kinds of\nnonlinear oscillators, the parametrically driven oscillator and the resonantly\ndriven Duffing oscillator, which exhibit the dynamical bistable states. Cold\natoms behave not only as the single-particle nonlinear oscillators, but also as\nthe coupled oscillators by the light-induced inter-atomic interaction, which\nleads to the phase transitions far from equilibrium in a way similar to the\nphase transition in equilibrium. The parametrically driven cold atoms show the\nideal mean-field symmetry-breaking transition, and the symmetry is broken with\nrespect to time translation by the modulation period. Such a phase transition\nresults from the cooperation and competition between the inter-particle\ninteraction and the fluctuations, which lead to the nonlinear switching of\natoms between the vibrational states, and the experimentally measured critical\ncharacteristics prove it as the ideal mean-field transition class.

There are two main difficulties in proving this\npolynomial dependence of the discrete $H^{-1}$ error estimate. Firstly, it is\ndifficult to prove discrete energy law and discrete stability results due to\nthe complex structure of the bilinear form of the Morley element\ndiscretization.

It is shown that the fully discrete\nscheme possesses convergence rates of order $ O(h^{\\gamma} ) $ in space and\norder $ O( \\tau^{ \\frac{\\gamma}{2} } )$ in time, subject to the spatial\ncorrelation of the noise process, characterized by $\n\\|A^{\\frac{\\gamma-1}2}Q^{\\frac12}\\|_{\\mathcal{L}_2}<\\infty, \\, \\gamma \\in[\\frac\nd3,2] $, $ d\\in\\{1,2,3\\}$. In particular, a classical convergence rate of order\n$O(h^2 +\\tau)$ is reachable, even in multiple space dimensions, when the\naforementioned condition is fulfilled with $ \\gamma = 2 $. Numerical examples\nconfirm the previous findings. \n\n"}

It aims to recommend a\nsequence of places of interest (POIs) for a user to visit that maximizes the\nuser's satisfaction. When adding a POI to a recommended trip, it is essential\nto understand the context of the recommendation, including the POI popularity,\nother POIs co-occurring in the trip, and the preferences of the user. These\ncontextual factors are learned separately in existing studies, while in\nreality, they impact jointly on a user's choice of a POI to visit. In this\nstudy, we propose a POI embedding model to jointly learn the impact of these\ncontextual factors. We call the learned POI embedding a context-aware POI\nembedding. To showcase the effectiveness of this embedding, we apply it to\ngenerate trip recommendations given a user and a time budget. We propose two\ntrip recommendation algorithms based on our context-aware POI embedding. The\nfirst algorithm finds the exact optimal trip by transforming and solving the\ntrip recommendation problem as an integer linear programming problem. To\nachieve a high computation efficiency, the second algorithm finds a\nheuristically optimal trip based on adaptive large neighborhood search. We\nperform extensive experiments on real datasets.

For on- or\noff-axis flares, the upward/outward bulk motion causes a reduction of the iron\nKalpha line width. To a distant observer with a low inclination angle (\\theta_o\n\\simlt 30deg.), larger upward/outward bulk velocities decrease the extension of\nthe red wing, with little change in the location of the blue `edge'. In\ncontrast, an observer at a large inclination angle (e.g. \\theta_o=60deg.) sees\nboth the red wing and the blue `edge' change with the bulk velocity. The\nequivalent width of the iron Kalpha line decreases rapidly with increasing bulk\nvelocity of flares. However, the `narrower' line profiles observed in some\nobjects (e.g. IC4329A and NGC4593) are difficult to produce using the\nout-flowing magnetic flare model with an appropriate equivalent width unless\nthe X-ray emission is concentrated in an outer region with a radius of several\ntens of r_g=GM/c^2 or more. An important result is that the iron Kalpha line\nintensity is found to be constant even though the continuum flux varies\nsignificantly, which is true for out-flowing magnetic flares with different\nbulk velocities but similar intrinsic luminosities when located close to the\ncentral black hole. We find that fluctuations in the bulk velocities of\nout-flowing low-height flares located at the inner region (r\\simlt 15r_g) can\naccount for a constant iron Kalpha line and significant continuum variation as\nobservered in MCG-6-30-15 and NGC5548.

Abstract: Elliptical galaxies are modelled as Sersic luminosity distributions with\ndensity profiles (DPs) for the total mass adopted from the DPs of haloes within\ndissipationless LambdaCDM N-body simulations. Ellipticals turn out to be\ninconsistent with cuspy low-concentration NFW models representing the total\nmass, nor are they consistent with a steeper -1.5 inner slope, nor with the\nshallower models proposed by Navarro et al. 04, nor with NFW models 10 times\nmore concentrated than predicted, as deduced from several X-ray observations:\nthe mass models, extrapolated inwards, lead to local mass-to-light ratios that\nare smaller than the stellar value inside an effective radius (R_e), and to\ncentral aperture velocity dispersions that are much smaller than observed. This\nconclusion remains true as long as there is no sharp steepening (slope < -2) of\nthe dark matter (DM) DPs just inside 0.01 virial radii. The too low total mass\nand velocity dispersion produced within R_e by an NFW-like total mass profile\nsuggests that the stellar component should dominate the DM one out to at least\nR_e. It should then be difficult to kinematically constrain the inner slope of\nthe dark matter DP of ellipticals.

We show the extreme hierarchical nature of\nthese objects and discuss the limits of simple ways to capture their evolution.\nIn a model where cooling flows are suppressed at late times by AGN activity,\nthe stars of BCGs are formed very early (50 per cent at z~5, 80 per cent at\nz~3) and in many small galaxies. The high star formation rates in these high-z\nprogenitors are fuelled by rapid cooling, not by merger-triggered starbursts.\nWe find that model BCGs assemble surprisingly late: half their final mass is\ntypically locked-up in a single galaxy after z~0.5. Because most of the\ngalaxies accreted onto BCGs have little gas content and red colours, late\nmergers do not change the apparent age of BCGs.

Chau,\nquant-ph/0602099 v3], which was claimed to be able to break all quantum string\nseal protocols, including the one proposed by He [G. P. He, Int. J. Quant.\nInform. 4, 677 (2006)]. Here it will be shown that the information obtained in\nHe's protocol by the attack is trivial. Thus Chau's conclusion that all quantum\nstring seals are insecure is wrong. It will also be shown that some other\nclaims in Chau's paper are inaccurate either. \n\n"}

Symmetry of various measurements\nunder the time reversal is analyzed. Time-symmetrized counterfactuals are\nintroduced. It is argued that the time-symmetrized formalism demonstrates novel\nprofound features of quantum theory and that recent criticism of the formalism\nis unfounded. \n\n"}
