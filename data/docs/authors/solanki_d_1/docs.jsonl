Measurements and comparison with relativistic hydrodynamic models\nindicate that the matter thermalizes in an unexpectedly short time, has an\nenergy density at least 15 times larger than needed for color deconfinement,\nhas a temperature about twice the critical temperature predicted by lattice\nQCD, and appears to exhibit collective motion with ideal hydrodynamic\nproperties - a \"perfect liquid\" that appears to flow with a near-zero viscosity\nto entropy ratio - lower than any previously observed fluid and perhaps close\nto a universal lower bound.

Although the pion production has not been\ntraditionally included in the global analyses, we find that the shape of the\nnuclear modification factor $R_{\\rm dAu}$ of the pion $p_T$-spectrum at\nmidrapidity retains sensitivity to the gluon distributions, providing evidence\nfor shadowing and EMC-effect in the nuclear gluons.

Methods: We calculate the neutrino flux from $\\beta$\nprocesses using nuclear statistical equilibrium abundances convoluted with\napproximate neutrino spectra of the individual nuclei and the thermal neutrino\nspectrum (pair+plasma). Results: Although the two considered thermonuclear\nsupernova explosion scenarios are expected to produce almost identical\nelectromagnetic output, their neutrino signatures appear vastly different,\nwhich allow an unambiguous identification of the explosion mechanism: a pure\ndeflagration produces a single peak in the neutrino light curve, while the\naddition of the second maximum characterizes a delayed-detonation. We\nidentified the following main contributors to the neutrino signal: (1) weak\nelectron neutrino emission from electron captures (in particular on the protons\nCo55 and Ni56) and numerous beta-active nuclei produced by the thermonuclear\nflame and/or detonation front, (2) electron antineutrinos from positron\ncaptures on neutrons, and (3) the thermal emission from pair annihilation.

At\nenergies above about 10^{16} eV (in ice), the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM)\neffect significantly reduces the cross sections for the two dominant\nelectromagnetic interactions: bremsstrahlung and pair production. At higher\nenergies, above about 10^{20} eV, the photonuclear cross section becomes larger\nthan that for pair production, and direct pair production and electronuclear\ninteractions become dominant over bremsstrahlung.

This so-called gamma-process requires sufficiently high\ntemperatures and occurs in pre-explosive or explosive O/Ne burning, depending\non the mass of the star. Although the gamma-process has been successful in\nproducing a large range of p-nuclei, two mass regions remain problematic, A<110\nand 150<A<165, where a number of p-nuclei are severely underproduced. The\norigin of the problems is yet to be identified.

The diffusion process is\nsimulated using relativistic Fokker-Planck dynamics for elastic scattering in a\nhydrodynamic background. The heavy-quark transport coefficients in the medium\nare obtained from non-perturbative $T$-matrix interactions which build up\nresonant correlations close to the transition temperature. The latter also form\nthe basis for hadronization of heavy quarks into heavy-flavor mesons via\nrecombination with light quarks from the medium. The pertinent resonance\nrecombination satisfies energy conservation and provides an equilibrium mapping\nbetween quark and meson distributions. The recombination probability is derived\nfrom the resonant heavy-quark scattering rate. Consequently, recombination\ndominates at low transverse momentum ($p_T$) and yields to fragmentation at\nhigh $p_T$. Our approach thus emphasizes the role of resonance correlations in\nthe diffusion and hadronization processes. We calculate the nuclear\nmodification factor and elliptic flow of $D$- and $B$-mesons for Au-Au\ncollisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, and compare their\ndecay-electron spectra to available data.

We find that this effect is enough to spoil quark number scaling\nin elliptic flow. A lack of scaling in data therefore does not signal the\nabsence of partonic degrees of freedom and hadronization by coalescence.

Predictions of 146Sm and 144Sm\nproduction in the gamma-process in massive stars are at odds with these\nconstraints and this is partly due to deficiences in the prediction of the\nreaction rates involved. The production ratio depends almost exclusively on the\n(gamma,n)/(gamma,alpha) branching at 148Gd. A measurement of\n144Sm(alpha,gamma)148Gd at low energy had discovered considerable discrepancies\nbetween cross section predictions and the data. Although this reaction cross\nsection mainly depends on the optical alpha+nucleus potential, no global\noptical potential has yet been found which can consistently describe the\nresults of this and similar alpha-induced reactions at the low energies\nencountered in astrophysical environments. The untypically large deviation in\n144Sm(alpha,gamma) and the unusual energy dependence can be explained, however,\nby low-energy Coulomb excitation which is competing with compound nucleus\nformation at very low energies.

This\nnon-monotonic variation is characterized by the presence of a minimum in dv1/dy\nbetween 11.5 and 19.6 GeV and a change in the sign of dv1/dy twice between 7.7\nand 39 GeV. At small impact parameters the product of the moments of net-proton\ndistribution, kurtosis x variance and skewness x standard deviation are\nobserved to be significantly below the corresponding measurements at large\nimpact parameter collisions for 19.6 and 27 GeV.

NN SRC have been extensively\nprobed through two-nucleon knock- out reactions in both pion and electron\nscattering experiments. We report here on the detection of two-nucleon\nknock-out events from neutrino interactions and discuss their topological\nfeatures as possibly involving NN SRC content in the target argon nuclei. The\nArgoNeuT detector in the Main Injector neutrino beam at Fermilab has recorded a\nsample of 30 fully reconstructed charged current events where the leading muon\nis accompanied by a pair of protons at the interaction vertex, 19 of which have\nboth protons above the Fermi momentum of the Ar nucleus. Out of these 19\nevents, four are found with the two protons in a strictly back-to-back high\nmomenta configuration directly observed in the final state and can be\nassociated to nucleon Resonance pionless mechanisms involving a pre-existing\nshort range correlated np pair in the nucleus. Another fraction (four events)\nof the remaining 15 events have a reconstructed back-to-back configuration of a\nnp pair in the initial state, a signature compatible with one-body Quasi\nElastic interaction on a neutron in a SRC pair. The detection of these two\nsubsamples of the collected (mu- + 2p) events suggests that mechanisms directly\ninvolving nucleon-nucleon SRC pairs in the nucleus are active and can be\nefficiently explored in neutrino-argon interactions with the LAr TPC\ntechnology. \n\n"}

They have also recently become the\nbaseline for studying the in-medium modification of parton showers in\nultra-relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions. The jet shape is a function of\ntwo angular parameters $R$ and $r$, which can be at hierarchical scales.

Analytical solutions of the stationary\nneutron transport equation are given using inelastic neutron scattering cross\nsections derived in an appendix. They neglect any inelastic process except the\nparamagnetic scattering and hence still underestimate very-cold neutron\ndensities. Molecular oxygen with its triplet ground state appears particularly\npromising, notably as a host in fully deuterated oxygen-clathrate hydrate, or\nmore exotically, in dry oxygen-He4 van der Waals clusters. At a neutron\ntemperature about 6 K, for which neutron conversion to ultra-cold neutrons by\nsingle-phonon emission in pure superfluid He4 works best, conversion rates due\nto paramagnetic scattering in the clathrate are found to be a factor 9 larger.\nWhile in conversion the neutron imparts only a single energy quantum to the\nmedium, the multi-step paramagnetic cooling cascade leads to further strong\nenhancements of very-cold neutron densities, e.g., by a factor 14 (57) for an\ninitial neutron temperature of 30 K (100 K), for the moderator held at about\n1.3 K.

In\nALICE, these hyperons are reconstructed via the detection of their weak decay\nproducts, which are identified through their measured ionisation losses and\nmomenta in the Time Projection Chamber.

These degeneracies cannot be broken by the CMB constraint on the\neffective number of neutrinos, N_eff. However, since big bang nucleosynthesis\n(BBN) is also affected by a light WIMP and equivalent neutrinos, complementary\nBBN and CMB constraints can break some of the degeneracy. In a previous paper\nBBN and CMB were combined to explore allowed ranges for m_chi, Delta N_nu, and\nN_eff for light WIMPs that annihilate electromagnetically (EM) to photons\nand/or electrons/positrons. In this paper BBN predictions with a light WIMP\nthat only couples to neutrinos are calculated. Recent observed abundances of\n^2H and ^4He are used to limit m_chi, Delta N_nu, N_eff, and the present-day\nbaryon density. Allowing for a neutrino coupled light WIMP and nonzero Delta\nN_nu, combined BBN and CMB data give lower limits to m_chi, with a best fit\nm_chi > 35 MeV, equivalent to no light WIMP at all. All masses below 4--9 MeV\n(depending on spin) are excluded. Without any light WIMP, BBN alone prefers\nDelta N_nu = 0.50 +- 0.23, favoring neither Delta N_nu = 0, nor a fully\nthermalized sterile neutrino (Delta N_nu = 1). This result is consistent with\nthe CMB constraint, N_eff = 3.30 +- 0.27, limiting \"new physics\" between BBN\nand recombination. Combining BBN and CMB data gives Delta N_nu = 0.35 +- 0.16\nand N_eff = 3.40 +- 0.16; while BBN and the CMB combined require Delta N_nu > 0\nat ~98% confidence, they disfavor Delta N_nu > 1 at > 99% confidence.

The theoretical analysis of these data\nconfirms the onset of the high energy eikonal regime in the scattering process\nwhich allows one to separate long range nuclear effects from the effects\ngenuinely related to the short distance structure of the deuteron. Our\nconclusion is that for the first time the deuteron is probed at relative\nmomenta beyond 300 MeV/c without dominating long range effects. As a result, at\nthese large nucleon momenta the cross section is sensitive to the nuclear\ndynamics at sub-fermi distances.

Nevertheless, given the\nunprecedented precision of this experiment, the existing experimental knowledge\nin \\lambda_pp\\mu\\ had to be improved.\n  Method: The MuCap experiment derived the weak capture rate from the muon\ndisappearance rate in ultra-pure hydrogen.

We develop a new formalism of the bremsstrahlung model\ntaking into account distribution of nucleons in the $\\alpha$ decaying nuclear\nsystem.

There is evidence that a Quark-Gluon-Plasma (QGP) was\ncreated at experiments at RHIC and LHC. The transition from the QGP back to the\nhadron gas is found to be a smooth cross over. For larger net-baryon densities\nand lower temperatures, it is expected that the QCD phase diagram exhibits a\nrich structure, such as a first-order phase transition between hadronic and\npartonic matter which terminates in a critical point, or exotic phases like\nquarkyonic matter. The discovery of these landmarks would be a breakthrough in\nour understanding of the strong interaction and is therefore in the focus of\nvarious high-energy heavy-ion research programs. The Compressed Baryonic Matter\n(CBM) experiment at FAIR will play a unique role in the exploration of the QCD\nphase diagram in the region of high net-baryon densities, because it is\ndesigned to run at unprecedented interaction rates.

BES-II will cover the\ncollision energy range 3.0 to 19.6 GeV. This is the region of interest in the\nsearch for a critical point and first-order phase transition, identified by the\nresults from BES-I and by model calculations. For the collider-mode portion of\nthe energy scan, 7.7 to 19.6 GeV, eTOF will extend particle identification\n(PID) for pions, kaons, and protons to a rapidity of 1.2, complementing the\ninner Time Projection Chamber (iTPC) upgrade to the forward tracking. The\nrapidity coverage for PID would extend to only 0.8 without the eTOF upgrade.\nThe eTOF upgrade will enable precision studies of the key bulk property\nobservables, essential to the BES-II search.

With the help of\neffective Lagrangians in which coupling constants are determined by the SU(3)\nsymmetry, the $\\Sigma^*K$ and $\\Sigma K^*$ interactions are described by the\nvector-meson and pseudoscalar-meson exchanges.

A bound state with quantum number $I(J^P)=1/2(3/2^-)$ is produced\nfrom the $\\Sigma^*K$ interaction, which can be identified as the $N(1875)$\nlisted in PDG.

With upgraded detectors at RHIC and LHC,\nit has become possible to measure hadrons beyond their ground states.\nTherefore, HIC provide a new method for studying exotic hadrons that are either\nhadronic molecular states or compact multiquark systems. Because their\nstructures are related to the fundamental properties of QCD, studying exotic\nhadrons is currently one of the most active areas of research in hadron\nphysics. Experiments carried out at various accelerator facilities have\nindicated that some exotic hadrons may have already been produced. The present\nreview is a summary of the current understanding of a selected set of exotic\nparticle candidates that can be potentially measured in HIC. It also includes\ndiscussions on the production of exotic hadrons in HIC based on the coalescence\nand statistical models. A more detailed discussion leads to the conclusion that\nthe yield of a hadron is typically an order of magnitude smaller when it is a\ncompact multiquark state than that of an excited hadronic state with normal\nquark numbers and/or a molecular configuration. Attention is also given to some\nof the proposed heavy exotic hadrons that could be produced with sufficient\nabundance in HIC because of the significant numbers of charm and bottom quarks\nproduced at RHIC and LHC, making it possible to study them in these\nexperiments.

We also\ndemonstrate that the effects due to quantum statistics (entirely encoded in the\nquadrupole) are parametrically leading contributions to the correlated particle\nproduction at large $N_c$. For non-identical quarks the quadrupole term also\nleads to correlated production which has characteristics similar to the HBT\neffect. \n\n"}

It is well known, however, that\nthe quenching of jets from their interaction with the medium leads to a\nmigration of jets from higher to lower $p_T$, making it challenging to directly\ninfer the degree and mechanism of jet energy loss. Our proposed quantile\nmatching procedure is inspired by (but not reliant on) the approximate\nmonotonicity of energy loss in the jet $p_T$. In this strategy, jets in\nheavy-ion collisions ordered by $p_T$ are viewed as modified versions of the\nsame number of highest-energy jets in proton-proton collisions, and the\nfractional energy loss as a function of jet $p_T$ is a natural observable\n($Q_{\\rm AA}$).

Recently, it has been predicted that the slope of\nthe directed flow at mid-rapidity for $D^0$ mesons, arising from the transport\nof charm quarks in the tilted medium, can be several times larger than that of\nlight flavor hadrons. The magnitude of the slope is expected to be sensitive to\nthe magnitude of the tilt and the charm quark drag coefficient in the medium.\nIt has also been predicted that the transient electromagnetic field generated\nat early time can induce a much larger directed flow for heavy quarks than for\nlight quarks. In these proceedings, we will report on the first measurement of\nthe directed flow for the $D^0$ and $\\bar{D}^0$ mesons as a function of\nrapidity in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{_{\\rm NN}}}$ = 200 GeV using high\nstatistics data collected with the Heavy Flavor Tracker in 2014 and 2016 RHIC\nruns. \n\n"}

Abstract: Recent measurements of the cosmic ray (CR) antiproton flux have been shown to\nchallenge existing CR propagation models. It was shown that the reacceleration\nmodels designed to match secondary to primary nuclei ratios (e.g.,\nboron/carbon) produce too few antiprotons. Matching both the secondary to\nprimary nuclei ratio and the antiproton flux requires artificial breaks in the\ndiffusion coefficient and the primary injection spectrum suggesting the need\nfor other approaches.\n  In the present paper we discuss one possibility to overcome these\ndifficulties. Using the measured antiproton flux AND B/C ratio to fix the\ndiffusion coefficient, we show that the spectra of primary nuclei as measured\nin the heliosphere may contain a fresh local \"unprocessed\" component at low\nenergies perhaps associated with the Local Bubble, thus decreasing the measured\nsecondary to primary nuclei ratio.

Abstract: We show that uncertainties in the values of the surface heavy element\nabundances of the Sun are the largest source of the theoretical uncertainty in\ncalculating the p-p, pep, 8B, 13N, 15O, and 17F solar neutrino fluxes. We\nevaluate for the first time the sensitivity (partial derivative) of each solar\nneutrino flux with respect to the surface abundance of each element. We then\ncalculate the uncertainties in each neutrino flux using `conservative\n(preferred)' and `optimistic' estimates for the uncertainties in the element\nabundances. The total conservative (optimistic) composition uncertainty in the\npredicted 8B neutrino flux is 11.6% (5.0%) when sensitivities to individual\nelement abundances are used. The traditional method that lumps all abundances\ninto a single quantity (total heavy element to hydrogen ratio, Z/X) yields a\nlarger uncertainty, 20%. The uncertainties in the carbon, oxygen, neon,\nsilicon, sulphur, and iron abundances all make significant contributions to the\nuncertainties in calculating solar neutrino fluxes; the uncertainties of\ndifferent elements are most important for different neutrino fluxes.

It turned out that only $N_t$=6,8 and 10 can be\nused for a controlled extrapolation, $N_t$=4 is out of the scaling region.\nSince the QCD transition is a non-singular cross-over there is no unique $T_c$.\nThus, different observables lead to different numerical $T_c$ values even in\nthe continuum and thermodynamic limit. The peak of the renormalized chiral\nsusceptibility predicts $T_c$=151(3)(3) MeV, wheres $T_c$-s based on the\nstrange quark number susceptibility and Polyakov loops result in 24(4) MeV and\n25(4) MeV larger values, respectively.

Parity violation arises from the interference of electromagnetic and\nweak neutral amplitudes, and the $Z^0$ of the Standard Model couples primarily\nto neutrons at low $Q^2$. The data can be interpreted with as much confidence\nas electromagnetic scattering. After briefly reviewing the present theoretical\nand experimental knowledge of neutron densities, we discuss possible parity\nviolation measurements, their theoretical interpretation, and applications. The\nexperiments are feasible at existing facilities. We show that theoretical\ncorrections are either small or well understood, which makes the interpretation\nclean. The quantitative relationship to atomic parity nonconservation\nobservables is examined, and we show that the electron scattering asymmetries\ncan be directly applied to atomic PNC because the observables have\napproximately the same dependence on nuclear shape. \n\n"}

In this article we try to give a\ncomprehensive overview of the subject. We start with a general introduction to\ncalorimetry where the basic elements that characterize the development of\nelectromagnetic and hadronic showers are discussed. Then we describe in detail\nthe operation principle and the properties of calorimeters equipped with quartz\nfibers. The main advantages of this type of calorimeters are the radiation\nhardness, the fast response and the compact detector dimensions, features that\nderive from the quartz material and the specific mechanism of operation. A\nsection is devoted to presenting the quartz fiber calorimeters that have been\nbuilt or planned to in various experiments to operate as centrality detectors,\ntrigger detectors, luminosity monitors or general purpose very forward\ncalorimeters. \n\n"}
