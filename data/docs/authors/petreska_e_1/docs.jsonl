It is then shown that the gluino\nNLSP (GNLSP) models lead to a compressed sfermion spectrum with the sleptons\noften heavier than the squarks at least for the first two generations. The\nrelic density here is governed by gluino coannihilation which is responsible\nfor a relatively small mass splitting between the gluino and the neutralino\nmasses. Thus the GNLSP class of models is very predictive first because the\nSUSY production cross sections at the LHC are dominated by gluino production\nand second because the gluino production itself proceeds dominantly through a\nsingle channel which allows for a direct determination of the gluino mass and\nan indirect determination of the neutralino mass due to a linear relation\nbetween these two masses which is highly constrained by coannihilation. A\ndetailed analysis of these models shows that the jet production and tagged\nb-jets from the gluino production can be discriminated from the standard model\nbackground with appropriate cuts. It is found that the GNLSP models can be\ntested with just 10 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity and may therefore be\nchecked with low luminosity runs in the first data at the LHC. Thus if a GNLSP\nmodel is realized, the LHC will turn into a gluino factory through a profuse\nproduction of gluinos with typically only a small fraction $\\lesssim 5%$ of\ntotal SUSY events arising from other production modes over the allowed GNLSP\nmodel parameter space. \n\n"}

In order to make quantitative\npredictions at realistically low plasma temperatures (O(T_c)), experimentally\nrelevant low dilepton mass (O(1 GeV)) and strong coupling (alphaS=0.5-1), we\ntake into account not only the higher order pQCD reaction mechanisms, but also\nthe non-perturbative spectral functions (off-shellness) and self-energies of\nthe quarks, anti-quarks and gluons thus going beyond the leading twist. For\nthis purpose, our calculations utilize parametrizations of the non-perturbative\npropagators for quarks and gluons provided by the dynamical quasi-particle\nmodel (DQPM) matched to reproduce lattice data. The DQPM describes QCD\nproperties in terms of single-particle Green's functions (in the sense of a\ntwo-particle irreducible approach) and leads to the notion of the constituents\nof the sQGP being effective quasiparticles, which are massive and have broad\nspectral functions (due to large interaction rates).

In the case of\na system initially consisting of nu_e and anti-nu_e with the same energy\nspectrum but different number densities, the mean field is very well\napproximated by the total angular momentum of a neutrino gyroscope. Assuming\nthat NFIS evolution is independent of the initial neutrino emission angle, the\nso-called single-angle approximation, we find that the evolution is governed by\ntwo types of resonances driven by precession and nutation of the gyroscope,\nrespectively. The net flavor transformation crucially depends on the\nadiabaticity of evolution through these resonances.

Two long-range ridge-like structures, one on the near\nside and one on the away side, are observed when the per-trigger yield obtained\nin low-multiplicity events is subtracted from the one in high-multiplicity\nevents. The excess on the near-side is qualitatively similar to that recently\nreported by the CMS collaboration, while the excess on the away-side is\nreported for the first time. The two-ridge structure projected onto azimuthal\nangle is quantified with the second and third Fourier coefficients as well as\nby near-side and away-side yields and widths.

Abstract: We investigate the applicability of fluid dynamics in ultrarelativistic heavy\nion (AA) collisions and high multiplicity proton nucleus (pA) collisions.

The interactions between the partons in the shower and\nthe deconfined matter within which they find themselves lead to energy loss.\nThe momentum scales associated with the medium (of the order of the\ntemperature) and with typical interactions between partons in the shower and\nthe medium are sufficiently soft that strongly coupled physics plays an\nimportant role in energy loss. We model these interactions using qualitative\ninsights from holographic calculations of the energy loss of energetic light\nquarks and gluons in a strongly coupled plasma, obtained via gauge/gravity\nduality.

The model has a single free parameter that we fit to a single\nexperimental measurement. We then confront our model with experimental data on\nmany other jet observables, focusing here on boson-jet observables, finding\nthat it provides a good description of present jet data. Next, we provide the\npredictions of our hybrid model for many measurements to come, including those\nfor inclusive jet, dijet, photon-jet and Z-jet observables in heavy ion\ncollisions with energy $\\sqrt{s}=5.02$ ATeV coming soon at the LHC. As the\nstatistical uncertainties on near-future measurements of photon-jet observables\nare expected to be much smaller than those in present data, with about an order\nof magnitude more photon-jet events expected, predictions for these observables\nare particularly important.

We compute the probability distribution of orbital\nparameters for PBH binaries formed in the early Universe, accounting for tidal\ntorquing by all other PBHs, as well as standard large-scale adiabatic\nperturbations. We then check whether the orbital parameters of PBH binaries\nformed in the early Universe can be significantly affected between formation\nand merger. Our analytic estimates indicate that the tidal field of halos and\ninteractions with other PBHs, as well as dynamical friction by unbound standard\nDM particles, do not do significant work on nor torque PBH binaries. We\nestimate the torque due to baryon accretion to be much weaker than previous\ncalculations, albeit possibly large enough to significantly affect the\neccentricity of typical PBH binaries. We also revisit the PBH-binary merger\nrate resulting from gravitational capture in present-day halos, accounting for\nPoisson fluctuations. If binaries formed in the early Universe survive to the\npresent time, as suggested by our analytic estimates, they dominate the total\nPBH merger rate. Moreover, this merger rate would be orders of magnitude larger\nthan LIGO's current upper limits if PBHs make a significant fraction of the\ndark matter. As a consequence, LIGO would constrain ~10-300 Msun PBHs to\nconstitute no more than ~1% of the dark matter.

Beyond the nearly\nscale-invariant primordial GW spectrum produced during inflation, a spectrum\nwith a much richer structure is typically generated during the preheating phase\nafter inflation (or after some other phase transition at lower energies). This\nraises the question of what one can learn from a future observation of the\nstochastic gravitational wave background spectrum about the underlying physics\nduring preheating. Recently, it has been shown that during preheating\nnon-perturbative quasi-stable objects like oscillons can act as strong sources\nfor GW, leading to characteristic features such as distinct peaks in the\nspectrum. In this paper, we study the GW production from oscillons using\nsemi-analytical techniques. In particular, we discuss how the GW spectrum is\naffected by the parameters that characterise a given oscillon system, e.g. by\nthe background cosmology, the asymmetry of the oscillons and the evolution of\nthe number density of the oscillons.

The loss of Goldstones may be\ndue to a redundancy or the generation of a gap. This phenomena is called an\nInverse Higgs Mechanism (IHM). However, there are cases when a Goldstone boson\nassociated with a broken generator does not appear in the low energy theory\ndespite the lack of the existence of an associated IHM. In this paper we will\nshow that in such cases the relevant broken symmetry can be realized, without\nthe aid of an associated Goldstone, if there exists a proper set of operator\nconstraints, which we call a Dynamical Inverse Higgs Mechanism (DIHM).

In this paper, we study\nhow Cuscuton modifies the constraint sector of Einstein gravity. In particular,\nwe study Cuscuton cosmology and show that even though Cuscuton can have an\narbitrary equation of state, or time dependence, and is thus inhomogeneous; its\nperturbations do not introduce any additional dynamical degree of freedom and\nonly satisfy a constraint equation, amounting to an effective modification of\ngravity on large scales. Therefore, Cuscuton can be considered to be a minimal\ntheory of evolving dark energy, or a minimal modification of a cosmological\nconstant, as it has no internal dynamics. Moreover, this is the only\nmodification of Einstein gravity to our knowledge that does not introduce any\nadditional degrees freedom (and is not conformally equivalent to the Einstein\ngravity).

At each temperature, the lattice calculation is carried out\nwith high statistics using more than 100 gauge configurations. In particular,\nabout 1000 gauge configurations are used near the critical temperature T_c. The\nchiral extrapolation is done from the lattice result with the current-quark\nmass of m_q = 21,36,52 MeV.

A sufficient quartic interaction for our Higgs boson arises from the\nusual gauge contribution together with a radiative contribution from a heavy\ntop squark.

The Skyrme model is supposed to encode the large $N_c$ behavior\nof baryons, and can be formulated for both of these large $N_c$ limits. There\nis an apparent paradox associated with the large $N_c$ behavior of strange\nquark matrix elements in the Skyrme model. The model only distinguishes between\nthe two large $N_c$ limits via the $N_c$ scaling of the couplings and the\nWitten-Wess-Zumino term, so that a vanishing leading order strange matrix\nelement in the TLNC limit implies that it also vanishes at leading order in the\nOLNC limit, contrary to the expectations based on the\nsuppression/non-suppression of quark loops.

We compare our results with the values\nobtained in other studies and also investigate more technical aspects such as a\npotential bias in the fits when fitting particle ratios or yields. Using\nparametrizations of the temperature and baryonic chemical potential as a\nfunction of energy, we compare the model calculations with data for a large\nvariety of hadron yield ratios. We provide quantitative predictions for\nexperiments at LHC energy, as well as for the low RHIC energy of 62.4 GeV. The\nrelation of the determined parameters with the QCD phase boundary is discussed. \n\n"}

We compare to data on mid rapidity\ncharged pions produced in central Au + Au collisions and find a very good\nagreement. The shape of the distribution at low $m_t-m$ is explained in part as\nan effect arising from the high mean pion density achieved in these reactions.\nThe difference between the positive and negative pion distributions in the same\nregion is attributed in part to the different average yields of each kind of\ncharged pions. \n\n"}

Polarized atoms from a Stern-Gerlach Atomic Beam\nSource are injected into a storage cell internal to the HERA electron ring.\nAtoms diffusing from the center of the storage cell into a side tube are\nanalyzed to determine the atomic fraction and the atomic polarizations. The\natoms have a nuclear polarization, the axis of which is defined by an external\nmagnetic holding field. The holding field was longitudinal during 1996-2000,\nand was changed to transverse in 2001. The design of the target is described,\nthe method for analyzing the target polarization is outlined, and the\nperformance of the target in the various running periods is presented. \n\n"}
