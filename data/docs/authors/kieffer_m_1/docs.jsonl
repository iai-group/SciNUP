In this case, annihilation of\ndark matter in the halo of the Milky Way should produce gamma-rays at a level\nwhich may soon be observable.

Here we show,\nusing the largest ever simulation of the formation of a galactic halo, that\nsuch small-scale structure will, in fact, have a negligible impact on dark\nmatter detectability. Rather, the dominant and likely most easily detectable\nsignal will be produced by diffuse dark matter in the main halo of the Milky\nWay.

We use this sample to determine, for the first time in the 15--55\nkeV band, the evolution of blazars. We find that, contrary to the Seyfert-like\nAGNs detected by BAT, the population of blazars shows strong positive\nevolution. This evolution is comparable to the evolution of luminous optical\nQSOs and luminous X-ray selected AGNs. We also find evidence for an\nepoch-dependence of the evolution as determined previously for radio-quiet\nAGNs. We interpret both these findings as a strong link between accretion and\njet activity. In our sample, the FSRQs evolve strongly, while our best-fit\nshows that BL Lacs might not evolve at all. The blazar population accounts for\n10-20 % (depending on the evolution of the BL Lacs) of the Cosmic X-ray\nbackground (CXB) in the 15--55 keV band.

In this work we show that the lack of\ndetection of a GeV spectrum excess in almost all GRBs, though somewhat\nsurprisingly, can be well understood within the standard internal shock model\nand several alternatives like the photosphere-internal shock (gradual magnetic\ndissipation) model and the magnetized internal shock model.

The theory of\ngravitational aether is an alternative to general relativity that does not\nsuffer from this fine-tuning problem, as it decouples the quantum field theory\nvacuum from geometry, while remaining consistent with other tests of gravity.\nIn this paper, we study static black hole solutions in this theory and show\nthat it manifests a UV-IR coupling: Aether couples the spacetime metric close\nto the black hole horizon, to metric at infinity.

We discuss the method employing the relativistic line profiles of iron in\nthe X-ray domain, where the emergent spectrum is blurred by general\nrelativistic effects. Precision of spectra fitting procedure could be\ncompromised by inappropriate account of the angular distribution of the disc\nemission. Often a unique profile is assumed, invariable over the entire range\nof radii in the disc and energy in the spectral band. We study how sensitive\nthe spin determination is to the assumptions about the intrinsic angular\ndistribution of the emitted photons. We find that the uncertainty of the\ndirectional emission distribution translates to 20% uncertainty in\ndetermination of the marginally stable orbit. By assuming a rotating black hole\nin the centre of an accretion disc, we perform radiation transfer computations\nof an X-ray irradiated disc atmosphere to determine the directionality of\noutgoing X-rays in the 2-10 keV energy band. We implemented the simulation\nresults as a new extension to the KY software package for X-ray spectra fitting\nof relativistic accretion disc models. Although the parameter space is rather\ncomplex, leading to a rich variety of possible outcomes, we find that on\naverage the isotropic directionality reproduces our model data to the best\nprecision.

Fortunately, the Fermi-LAT diffuse gamma\nray measurements can further test these models, since the electrons and\npositrons produce gamma rays in their interactions in the interstellar medium.\nAlthough the dark matter gamma ray signal consistent with the local electron\nand positron measurements should be quite large, as we review, there are\nsubstantial uncertainties in the modeling of diffuse backgrounds and,\nadditionally, experimental uncertainties that make it difficult to claim a dark\nmatter discovery.

Similarly, the QPO frequency varies with the source count rate (S).\nHence, the significance of a QPO, scaling as S x Rs^2/W^(1/2) will also depend\non frequency. In addition, the significance also scales up with the square root\nof the integration time of the Fourier power density spectrum (T).\nConsequently, depending on the way data are considered, kHz QPOs may be\ndetected only over a limited range of their frequency spans or detected\npredominantly at some frequencies, leading potentially to biases in the\nobserved distributions of frequencies or frequency ratios. Although subject of\nmuch controversy, an observed clustering of QPO frequency ratios around 3/2 in\nSco X-1, also seen in other sources, has been previously used as an argument\nsupporting resonance based models of neutron star QPOs. In this paper, we\nmeasure how the statistical significance of both kHz QPOs vary with frequency\nfor three prototype neutron star kHz QPO sources, namely 4U1636-536, 4U0614+091\nand Sco X-1.

As a result, even a uniform\ndistribution of QPO frequencies will lead to peaks (in particular around 3/2)\nin the histogram of frequency ratios.

We find bursts with a wide variety of characteristics in\nserendipitous wide-field X-ray observations by EURECA/WATCH, RXTE/ASM,\nBeppoSAX/WFC, HETE-2/FREGATE, INTEGRAL/IBIS/ISGRI, and Swift/BAT, as well as\npointed observations by RXTE/PCA and HEXTE. Most of them reach a peak flux of\n~15 Crab, but a few only reach a peak flux below a Crab. One of the bursts\nshows a very strong photospheric radius-expansion phase. This allows us to\nevaluate the distance to the source: 3.2 kpc. The burst durations are between\n10 sec to 5 min. However, after one of the intermediate-duration bursts, a\nfaint tail is seen to at least ~2.4 hours after the start of the burst. One\nvery long burst lasted for several hours. This superburst candidate was\nfollowed by a normal type-I burst only 19 days later. This is, to our\nknowledge, the shortest burst-quench time among the superbursters. A superburst\nin this system is difficult to reconcile if it accretes at ~1% L_Edd. The\nintermediate-duration bursts occurred when 4U 0614+091's persistent emission\nwas lowest and calm, and when bursts were infrequent (on average one every\nmonth to 3 months). The average burst rate increased significantly after this\nperiod. The maximum average burst recurrence rate is once every week to 2\nweeks. The burst behaviour may be partly understood if there is at least an\nappreciable amount of helium present in the accreted material from the donor\nstar.

Instead, such a field describes a nonsingular particle whose spatial\ndimension is at least on the order of its Cartan radius. In particular, torsion\nmodifies Burinskii's model of the Dirac electron as a Kerr-Newman singular ring\nof the Compton size, by replacing the ring with a toroidal structure with the\nouter radius of the Compton size and the inner radius of the Cartan size.

The sharpness of the peaks in the OG model is less affected by this\nchange, but the range of magnetic inclination angles and viewing geometries\nresulting in double-peaked light curves is reduced. In a realistic\nmagnetosphere, the modification of field structure near the light cylinder due\nto plasma effects may change the shape of the polar cap and the location of the\nemission zones. We study the sensitivity of the light curves to different\nshapes of the polar cap for static and retarded vacuum dipole fields. In\nparticular, we consider polar caps traced by the last open field lines and\ncompare them to circular polar caps. We find that the TPC model is very\nsensitive to the shape of the polar cap, and a circular polar cap can lead to\nfour peaks of emission. The OG model is less affected by polar cap shapes, but\nis subject to big uncertainties of applying the vacuum field near the light\ncylinder. We conclude that deviations from vacuum field can lead to large\nuncertainties in the pulse shapes, and a more realistic force-free field should\nbe applied to the study of pulsar high energy emission. \n\n"}

Thermal Comptonisation by a hot electron cloud is a widely\naccepted mechanism accounting for its high energy emission, while the nature of\nmost of its soft X-ray output is not completely understood. A further low\nenergy component is typically needed to model the observed spectra: pure\nblackbody and Comptonisation-modified blackbody radiation by a lower\ntemperature (a few keV) electron plasma were suggested to explain the low\nenergy data. We studied the steady emission of GS 1826-238 by means of broad\nband (X to soft Gamma-rays) measurements obtained by the INTEGRAL observatory\nin 2003 and 2006.

We study a toy model where the flow behind a planar\nstationary accretion shock is adiabatically decelerated by an external\npotential. Two magnetic field geometries are considered: parallel or\nperpendicular to the shock. The entropy-vorticity wave, which is simply\nadvected in the unmagnetized limit, separates into five different waves: the\nentropy perturbations are advected, while the vorticity can propagate along the\nfield lines through two Alfven waves and two slow magnetosonic waves. The two\ncycles existing in the unmagnetized limit, advective-acoustic and purely\nacoustic, are replaced by up to six distinct MHD cycles. The phase differences\namong the cycles play an important role in determining the total cycle\nefficiency and hence the growth rate. Oscillations in the growth rate as a\nfunction of the magnetic field strength are due to this varying phase shift. A\nvertical magnetic field hardly affects the cycle efficiency in the regime of\nsuper-Alfvenic accretion that is considered.

We investigate\nthe evolution of this outburst with two-dimensional axisymmetric gasdynamical\ncalculations in which the cavities are inflated by relativistic cosmic rays.\nMany key observational features of the cavities and associated shocks are\nsuccessfully reproduced. The radial elongation of the cavities indicates that\ncosmic rays were injected into the cluster gas by a (jet) source moving out\nfrom the central AGN. AGN jets of this magnitude must be almost perfectly\nidentically bipolar. The relativistic momentum of a single jet would cause a\ncentral AGN black hole of mass 10^9 M_{sun} to recoil at ~6000 km s^{-1},\nexceeding kick velocities during black hole mergers, and be ejected from the\ncluster-center galaxy.

Simulations show that if octupolar field strongly dominates\nat the disc-magnetosphere boundary, then matter flows into the ring-like\noctupolar poles, forming ring-shape spots at the surface of the star above and\nbelow equator. The light-curves are complex and may have two peaks per period.\nIn case where the dipole field dominates, matter accretes in two ordered funnel\nstreams towards poles, however the polar spots are meridionally-elongated due\nto the action of the octupolar component.

However, recent numerical simulations suggested\nthat the transition to this regime is accompanied by a sudden \"burst\" of\nacceleration. We confirm this finding and attribute the acceleration to the\nsideways expansion of the jet - the magnetic energy is converted into the\nkinetic one in the strong magnetosonic rarefaction wave, which is launched when\nthe jet loses its external support. This type of acceleration, the rarefaction\nacceleration, is specific to relativistic jets because their energy budget can\nstill be dominated by magnetic energy even in highly super-fast magnetosonic\nregime.

Twenty\noptically selected GRBs and 12 X-ray selected GRBs are found, among which 17\noptically selected GRBs and 2 X-ray-selected GRBs have redshift measurements.\nWe fit the lightcurves with a smooth broken power-law and measure the temporal\ncharacteristic timescales of the bumps at FWHM.

The ratio of rising to decaying timescales is almost\nuniversal among bursts, but the ratio of the rising time to the peak time\nvaries from 0.3~1. The E_iso is tightly correlated with the peak luminosity and\nthe peak time of the bump in the burst frame. Assuming that the bumps signal\nthe deceleration of the GRB fireballs in a constant density medium, we\ncalculate the initial Lorentz factor (Gamma_0) and the deceleration radius\n(R_dec) of the GRBs in the optical-selected sample. It is found that Gamma_0\nare typically a few hundreds, and the typical deceleration radius is\nR_dec~10^{17} cm.

This amplification may be due to\nplasma instabilities driven by shock-accelerated cosmic rays (CRs). One\ncandidate is the cosmic ray current-driven (CRCD) instability (Bell 2004),\ncaused by the electric current of large Larmor radii CRs propagating parallel\nto the upstream magnetic field. Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations have shown\nthat the back-reaction of the amplified field on CRs would limit the\namplification factor of this instability to less than ~10 in galactic SNRs.

To quantitatively illustrate this point we calculate sky-maps of the\nratio of the gamma-ray emission from neutral pions to the ISM column density,\nand of IC to synchrotron emission, using detailed galactic cosmic-ray models\nand simulations. In the region above and below the galactic center, the ISM\ntemplate underestimates the gamma-ray emission due to neutral pion decay by\napproximately 20%. Additionally, the synchrotron template tends to\nunder-estimate the IC emission at low energies (few GeV) and to over-estimate\nit at higher energies (tens of GeV) by potentially large factors that depend\ncrucially on the assumed magnetic field structure of the Galaxy.

A relativistic jet is capable of accelerating lower-energy heavy\nseed cosmic rays (CRs) to UHECRs on timescales comparable to the time it takes\nthe jet to pierce the large gaseous cloud.

Most of the molecular gas in\nBCGs is apparently consumed by star formation or is driven out of the nucleus\nby the AGN before it reaches the nuclear black hole. Bondi accretion from hot\natmospheres is generally unable to fuel powerful AGN, unless their black holes\nare more massive than their bulge luminosities imply. We identify several\npowerful AGN that reside in relatively gas-poor galaxies, indicating an\nunusually efficient mode of accretion, or that their AGN are powered by another\nmechanism. If these systems are powered primarily by black hole spin, rather\nthan by accretion, spin must also be tapped efficiently in some systems, i.e.,\n$P_{\\rm jet} > \\dot Mc^2$, or their black hole masses must be substantially\nlarger than the values implied by their bulge luminosities. We constrain the\n(model dependent) accretion rate at the transition from radiatively inefficient\nto radiatively efficient accretion flows to be a few percent of the Eddington\nrate, a value that is consistent with other estimates. \n\n"}

By\nperforming new two-dimensional and general-relativistic simulations onto a\nrotating black hole, we point out a novel feature, namely, that quasi-periodic\noscillations (QPOs) are naturally produced in the shock cone that develops in\nthe downstream part of the flow. Because the shock cone in the downstream part\nof the flow acts as a cavity trapping pressure perturbations, modes with\nfrequencies in the integer ratios 2:1 and 3:1 are easily produced. The\nfrequencies of these modes depend on the black-hole spin and on the properties\nof the flow, and scale linearly with the inverse of the black-hole mass. Our\nresults may be relevant for explaining the detection of QPOs in Sagittarius A*,\nonce such detection is confirmed by further observations.

In\nextreme cases, rapid variability of the emission suggests that structures of\nlength-scale smaller than the gravitational radius of the central black hole\nare imprinted on the jet as it is launched, and modulate the radiation released\nafter it has been accelerated to high Lorentz factor.

We analyze four GRBs (080916C, 090510,\n090902B and 090926A) jointly detected by Fermi LAT and Gamma-ray Burst Monitor\n(GBM), which have high quality lightcurves in both instrument energy bands.\nUsing the MeV prompt emission (GBM) data, we can record the energy output from\nthe central engine as a function of time.

Additional uncertainties arise due to the choices\nmade by analysts in determining Epeak (e.g., the start and stop times of\nintegration), imperfect knowledge of the response of the detector, different\nenergy ranges for various detectors, and differences in models used to fit the\nspectra. We examine the size of these individual sources of scatter by\ncomparing many independent pairs of published Epeak values for the same bursts.\nIndeed, the observed scatter in multiple reports of the same burst (often with\nthe same data) is greatly larger than the published statistical error bars. We\nmeasure that the one-sigma uncertainty associated with the analyst's choices is\n28%, i.e., 0.12 in Log10(Epeak), with the resultant errors always being\npresent.

These fields typically contain a relatively bright point\nsource and are used to calibrate `target' observations: they are therefore\nrarely imaged themselves. The observations used span a time range ~ 1984 - 2008\nand consist of eight different pointings, three different frequencies (8.4, 4.8\nand 1.4 GHz) and have a total observing time of 435 hours. We have searched for\ntransient and variable radio sources within these observations using components\nfrom the prototype LOFAR transient detection system. In this paper we present\nthe methodology for reducing large volumes of Very Large Array data; and we\nalso present a brief overview of the prototype LOFAR transient detection\nalgorithms. No radio transients were detected in this survey, therefore we\nplace an upper limit on the snapshot rate of GHz frequency transients > 8.0 mJy\nto rho less than or equal to 0.032 deg^-2 that have typical timescales 4.3 to\n45.3 days.

Strong magnetic fields (~10^{15} G) and short spin periods\n(~1-10 ms) have an important influence on how the magnetar interacts with the\ninfalling material. At long spin periods, weak magnetic fields, and high\naccretion rates, sufficient material is accreted to form a black hole, as is\ncommonly found for massive progenitor stars. When B<5*10^{14} G, accretion\ncauses the magnetar to spin sufficiently rapidly to deform triaxially and\nproduce gravitational waves, but only for ~50-200 s until it collapses to a\nblack hole. Conversely, at short spin periods, strong magnetic fields, and low\naccretion rates, the magnetar is in the \"propeller regime\" and avoids becoming\na black hole by expelling incoming material. This process spins down the\nmagnetar, so that gravitational waves are only expected if the initial\nprotoneutron star is spinning rapidly. Even when the magnetar survives, it\naccretes at least ~0.3 solar masses, so we expect magnetars born within these\ntypes of environments to be more massive than the 1.4 solar masses typically\nassociated with neutron stars. The propeller mechanism converts the ~10^{52}\nergs of spin energy in the magnetar into the kinetic energy of an outflow,\nwhich shock heats the outgoing supernova ejecta during the first ~10-30 s.

After initially considering radio loudnesses derived using total\nradio luminosities, we repeat the investigation using core radio luminosities\nonly, applying a previously established mass correction for these core\nluminosities. In both cases, for Eddington ratios < 1 per cent, Fanaroff-Riley\ntype I and broad-line radio galaxies are on average more radio-loud than\nSeyfert and low-ionization nuclear emission-line region galaxies. However, the\ndistribution of radio loudnesses for the mass-corrected, core-only sample is\nmuch narrower than that of the clearly bimodal total radio loudness\ndistribution. The advantages and disadvantages of using core- or lobe-dominated\nradio luminosity as a measure of instantaneous jet power are discussed. We\nfurthermore compare the core and total radio luminosities for the entire\nsample, as well as illustrating the importance of the mass term by comparing\nthe AGN with a sample of black hole X-ray binaries.

In the inner region of the ADAF, the flow is\nsignificantly pressured in the vertical direction by the magnetic field, and\ntherefore its gas pressure can be two orders of magnitude higher than that in\nthe ADAF without magnetic fields. This means that the magnetic field strength\nnear the black hole is underestimated by assuming equipartition between\nmagnetic and gas pressure with the conventional ADAF model. Our results show\nthat the magnetic field strength of the flow near the black hole horizon can be\nmore than one order of magnitude higher than that in the ADAF at 6GM/c^2, which\nimplies the Blandford-Znajek mechanism could be more important than the\nBlandford-Payne mechanism for ADAFs. We find that the accretion flow is\ndecelerated near the black hole by the magnetic field when the external imposed\nfield is strong enough or the gas pressure of the flow is low at the outer\nradius, or both. This corresponds to a critical accretion rate, below which the\naccretion flow will be arrested by the magnetic field near the black hole for a\ngiven external imposed field. In this case, the gas may accrete as magnetically\nconfined blobs diffusing through field lines in the region very close to the\nblack hole horizon, which is similar to those in compact stars. \n\n"}

The point source was also detected in follow-up higher\nfrequency(1170 MHz) observations. The spectral index for the point source\nobtained from the GMRT observations is alpha = -2.1. The steep spectrum, as\nwell as the location of the point source near the centre of the SNR establish\nthe fact that it is indeed the pulsar J2022+3842 associated with this SNR.\nConsistent with this, subsequent analysis of archival Chandra X-ray data shows\na point source coincident with the radio point source, as well as diffuse\nextended X-ray emission surrounding the unresolved source. However, no pulsed\nemission was detected despite deep searches at both 610 MHz and 1160 MHz\nalthough pulsed emission has been seen at 2 GHz with the GBT. It appears that\nthe most likely reason for not detecting the pulsed signal at the GMRT is\ntemporal broadening: for the estimated DM towards this SNR, the pulse\nbroadening time could be as large as tens of milliseconds. The diffuse X-ray\nemission is elongated along the same direction as the bipolar structure seen in\nthe radio. We interpret the radio lobes as having been formed from an\nequatorial wind.

By means of two- and three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, we\ninvestigate particle acceleration and magnetic field dissipation at the\ntermination shock of a relativistic striped wind. At the shock, the flow\ncompresses and the alternating fields annihilate by driven magnetic\nreconnection. Irrespective of the stripe wavelength \"lambda\" or the wind\nmagnetization \"sigma\" (in the regime sigma>>1 of magnetically-dominated flows),\nshock-driven reconnection transfers all the magnetic energy of alternating\nfields to the particles, whose average Lorentz factor increases by a factor of\nsigma with respect to the pre-shock value. The shape of the post-shock spectrum\ndepends primarily on the ratio lambda/(r_L*sigma), where r_L is the\nrelativistic Larmor radius in the wind. The spectrum becomes broader as the\nvalue of lambda/(r_L*sigma) increases, passing from a relativistic Maxwellian\nto a flat power-law tail with slope around -1.5, populated by particles\naccelerated by the reconnection electric field. Close to the equatorial plane\nof the wind, where the stripes are symmetric, the highest energy particles\nresulting from magnetic reconnection can escape ahead of the shock, and be\ninjected into a Fermi-like acceleration process.

The particle acceleration rate, which can shed light\non the acceleration process, is rarely measured in astrophysical environments.\nHere we use observations of gamma-ray burst afterglows, which are weakly\nmagnetized relativistic collisionless shocks in ion-electron plasma, to\nconstrain the rate of particle acceleration in such shocks. We find, based on\nX-ray and GeV afterglows, an acceleration rate that is most likely very fast,\napproaching the Bohm limit, when the shock Lorentz factor is in the range of\n10-100. In that case X-ray observations may be consistent with no amplification\nof the magnetic field in the shock upstream region. We examine the X-ray\nafterglow of GRB 060729, which is observed for 642 days showing a sharp decay\nin the flux starting about 400 days after the burst, when the shock Lorentz\nfactor is about 5.

There is evidence for strong\nmultipole magnetic fields in active magnetars, but the dipole field inferred\nfrom spin down measurements may be strongly biased by a particle wind. Recent\nchallenging observations of magnetars may be explained naturally in the wind\nbraking scenario: (1) The supernova energies of magnetars are of normal value;\n(2) The non-detection in Fermi observations of magnetars; (3) The problem posed\nby the low-magnetic field soft gamma-ray repeaters; (4) The relation between\nmagnetars and high magnetic field pulsars; (5) A decreasing period derivative\nduring magnetar outbursts. Transient magnetars may still be magnetic dipole\nbraking. This may explain why low luminosity magnetars are more likely to have\nradio emissions. In the wind braking scenario, magnetars are neutron stars with\nstrong multipole field. For some sources, a strong dipole field may be no\nlonger needed.

We detect the host\ngalaxies for 80 % of the GRBs in the sample, although only 42 % have Ks-band\ndetections, which confirms that GRB-selected host galaxies are generally blue.\nThe sample is not uniformly blue, however, with two extremely red objects\ndetected.

Using the wealth of the presently available data and an\nimproved averaging method, we obtain energy-dependent folded and averaged light\ncurves with unprecedented accuracy. We find that above ~5 keV, the modulation\ndepth decreases with the increasing energy, which is consistent with the\nmodulation being caused by both bound-free absorption and Compton scattering in\nthe stellar wind of the donor, with minima corresponding to the highest optical\ndepth, which occurs around the superior conjunction. We find a decrease of the\ndepth below ~3 keV, which appears to be due to re-emission of the absorbed\ncontinuum by the wind in soft X-ray lines. Based on the shape of the folded\nlight curves, any X-ray contribution from the jet in Cyg X-3, which emits\ngamma-rays detected at energies >0.1 GeV in soft spectral states, is found to\nbe minor up to ~100 keV.

By combining\nthe Planck data with observations from the WMAP we are able to determine the\nspectrum of this emission to high accuracy, unhindered by the large systematic\nbiases present in previous analyses. The derived spectrum is consistent with\npower-law emission with a spectral index of -2.55 +/- 0.05, thus excluding\nfree-free emission as the source and instead favouring hard-spectrum\nsynchrotron radiation from an electron population with a spectrum (number\ndensity per energy) dN/dE ~ E^-2.1.

We find that a circular binary system with a\nmisaligned circumbinary disk normally produces a double peaked\nmass-accretion-rate variation per binary orbit. This is because each black hole\npasses across the circumbinary disk plane and captures gas twice in one orbital\nperiod. Even in misaligned systems, however, a single peaked\nmass-accretion-rate variation per binary orbit is produced, if the orbital\neccentricity is moderately large (e\\lesssim0.3). The number of peaks in mass\naccretion rates can be understood simply in terms of the orbital phase\ndependence of the distance between each binary black hole and its closest inner\nedge of the circumbinary disk.

While there is general consensus that the flux modulation is due to\nvariable shading of the X-ray emitting regions on the surface of the neutron\nstar by the precessing accretion disk, the physical reason for the variation in\nthe pulse profiles has remained controversial. Following the suggestion that\nfree precession of the neutron star may be responsible for the variation in the\npulse profiles, we developed a physical model of strong feedback interaction\nbetween the neutron star and the accretion disk in order to explain the\nseemingly identical values for the periods of the two types of variations,\nwhich were found to be in basic synchronization.

We simulate the nearby\n(radius 250 pc) part of this population, corresponding to the closest ~35 000\nblack holes, using current best estimates of the mass distribution of stellar\nmass black holes combined with two models for the velocity distribution of\nstellar-mass IBH which bracket likely possibilities. We distribute this\npopulation of objects appropriately within the different phases of the ISM and\ncalculate the Bondi-Hoyle accretion rate, modified by a further dimensionless\nefficiency parameter \\lambda. Assuming a simple prescription for radiatively\ninefficient accretion at low Eddington ratios, we calculate the X-ray\nluminosity of these objects, and similarly estimate the radio luminosity from\nrelations found empirically for black holes accreting at low rates.

The resonant parametric instability is a well-known\nform of three-wave interaction in which a primary wave of frequency $\\omega_a$\nexcites a pair of secondary waves of frequency $\\omega_b+\\omega_c \\simeq\n\\omega_a$. Here we consider a nonresonant form of three-wave interaction in\nwhich a low-frequency primary wave excites a high-frequency p-mode and a\nlow-frequency g-mode such that $\\omega_b+\\omega_c >>\\omega_a$. We show that a\np-mode can couple so strongly to a g-mode of similar radial wavelength that\nthis type of interaction is unstable even if the primary wave amplitude is\nsmall. As an application, we analyze the stability of the tide in coalescing\nneutron star binaries to p-g mode coupling. We find that the equilibrium tide\nand dynamical tide are both p-g unstable at gravitational wave frequencies\nf_{gw} > 20 Hz and drive p-g pairs to significant energies on very short\ntimescales (much less than the orbital decay time). Resonant parametric\ncoupling to the tide is, by contrast, either stable or drives modes at a much\nsmaller rate. We do not solve for the saturation of the instability and\ntherefore cannot say precisely how it influences neutron star binaries.\nHowever, we show that if even a single daughter mode saturates near its wave\nbreaking amplitude, the p-g instability of the equilibrium tide: (i) induces\nsignificant orbital phase errors ($\\Delta \\phi$ > 1 radian) that accumulate\nprimarily at low frequencies (f_{gw} < 50 Hz) and (ii) heats the neutron star\ncore to T~10^{10} K.

The discovery of synchrotron gamma-ray flares in the Crab\nNebula, well above this limit, challenges this classical picture of particle\nacceleration. To overcome this limit, particles must accelerate in a region of\nhigh electric field and low magnetic field.

We find that the\nline centroids are blueshifted by 1480+/-140+/-60 km/s (the first and second\nterm errors are measurement and calibration uncertainties, respectively), which\nis fully consistent with that of the optical Omega filament.

In 2009, a warm Spitzer survey observed 30 SNe IIn\ndiscovered in 2003 - 2008 and detected 10 SNe at distances out to 175 Mpc with\nunreported late-time infrared emission, in some cases more than 5 years\npost-discovery. For this single epoch of data, the warm-dust parameters suggest\nthe presence of a radiative heating source consisting of optical/X-ray emission\ncontinuously generated by ongoing CSM interaction. Here we present\nmulti-wavelength follow-up observations of this sample of 10 SNe IIn and the\nwell-studied Type IIn SN 2010jl. A recent epoch of Spitzer observations reveals\nongoing mid-infrared emission from nine of the SNe in this sample. We also\ndetect three of the SNe in archival WISE data, in addition to SNe 1987A,\n2004dj, and 2008iy. For at least five of the SNe in the sample, optical and/or\nX-ray emission confirms the presence of radiative emission from ongoing CSM\ninteraction. The two Spitzer nondetections are consistent with the forward\nshock overrunning and destroying the dust shell, a result that places upper\nlimits on the dust-shell size. The optical and infrared observations confirm\nthe radiative heating model and constrain a number of model parameters,\nincluding progenitor mass-loss characteristics. All of the SNe in this sample\nexperienced an outburst on the order of tens to hundreds of years prior to the\nSN explosion followed by periods of less intense mass loss. Although all\nevidence points to massive progenitors, the variation in the data highlights\nthe diversity in SN IIn progenitor evolution. While these observations do not\nidentify a particular progenitor system, they demonstrate that future,\ncoordinated, multi-wavelength campaigns can constrain theoretical mass-loss\nmodels. \n\n"}

Compared to previous work, we improve the\ncalculation of the radiative force due to X-rays. More importantly, in addition\nto radiative pressure and radiative heating/cooling directly from the central\nAGN, in the momentum equation we also include the force due to the scattered\nand reprocessed photons. We find that the accretion flow properties change\nsignificantly due to this \"re-radiation\" effect. The inflow rate at the inner\nboundary is reduced, while the outflow rate at the outer boundary is enhanced\nby about one order of magnitude. This effect is more significant when the\ndensity at the outer boundary is higher. The properties of outflows such as\nvelocity, momentum and energy fluxes, and the ratio of outflow rate and the\naccretion rate, are calculated. We find that the efficiency of transferring the\nradiation power into the kinetic power of outflow is typically $10^{-3}$, far\nbelow the value of $\\sim 0.05$ which is assumed in some cosmological\nsimulations. The effect of the temperature of the gas at the outer boundary\n($T_0$) is investigated. When $T_0$ is high, the emitted luminosity of the\naccretion flow oscillates. This is because in this case the gas around the\nBondi radius can be more easily heated to be above the virial temperature due\nto its high internal energy.

In addition, the radioactive decay of elements produced in NS\nbinary mergers may result in transients visible in the optical and infrared\nwith peak luminosities on hours-days timescales. Simultaneous observations of\nthe inspiral GWs and signatures in the electromagnetic band may allow us to\ndirectly and independently determine both the luminosity distance and redshift\nto a binary. These standard sirens (the GW analog of standard candles) have the\npotential to provide an accurate measurement of the low-redshift Hubble flow.\nIn addition, these systems are absolutely calibrated by general relativity, and\ntherefore do not experience the same set of astrophysical systematics found in\ntraditional standard candles, nor do the measurements rely on a distance\nladder.

The\nbispectrum measures two key nonlinear properties of a time series -- its\nreversability in time, and the symmetry about the mean of its flux distribution\n-- for triplets of frequencies.

The phenomenology of such\nBondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretors is particularly rich when an accretion\ndisc forms around the secondary. The outer radius of such discs is commonly\nestimated from the net angular momentum produced by a density variation of\nmaterial across the BHL or Bondi accretion cylinder, as the latter is tilted\nwith respect to the direction to the primary due to orbital motion. But this\napproach has ignored the fact that the wind experiences an outward driving\nforce that the secondary does not. In actuality, the accretion stream falls\ntoward a retarded point in the secondary's orbit as the secondary is pulled\ntoward the primary relative to the stream. The result is a finite separation or\n\"accretion stream impact parameter\" (ASIP) separating the secondary and stream.\nWhen the orbital radius a_o exceeds the BHL radius r_b, the ratio of outer disc\nradius estimated as the ASIP to the conventional estimate\na_o^{1/2}/r_b^{1/2}>1. We therefore predict that discs will form at larger\nradii from the secondary than traditional estimates. This agrees with the\nimportance of the ASIP emphasized by Huarte-Espinosa et al.

In the\npresent paper we study analytically the charged black-hole-mirror bomb in the\nasymptotic regime qQ>>1 and for mirror radii r_m in the near-horizon region\nx_m=(r_m-r_+)/r_+<<tau, where tau=(r_+-r_-)/r_+ is the dimensionless\ntemperature of the black hole. In particular, we derive analytic expressions\nfor the oscillation frequencies w_R and the instability growth timescales 1/w_I\nof the superradiant confined fields. Remarkably, we find a simple linear\nscaling w_I \\propto qQ/r_+ for the imaginary part of the resonances in the\nasymptotic qQ>>(tau/x_m)^2>>1 regime, which implies that the instability\ntimescale 1/w_I of the system can be made arbitrarily short in the\nqQ-->infinity limit. The short instability timescale found in the linear regime\nalong with the spherical symmetry of the system, make the charged bomb a\nconvenient toy model for future numerical studies aimed to investigate the\nnon-linear end-state of superradiant instabilities. \n\n"}

Their spin history depends\nsensitively on details of the magnetic field structure, but idealized models\nfrom the 1980s and 1990s are still commonly used for calculating the magnetic\nfield components. This paper is the third in a series presenting results from a\nstep-by-step analysis which we are making of the problem, starting with very\nsimple models and then progressively including additional features one at a\ntime, with the aim of gaining new insights into the mechanisms involved. In our\nfirst two papers, the magnetic field structure in the disc was calculated for a\nstandard Shakura and Sunyaev model, by solving the magnetic induction equation\nnumerically in the stationary limit within the kinematic approximation; here we\nconsider a more general velocity field in the disc, including backflow. We find\nthat the profiles of the poloidal and toroidal components of the magnetic field\nare fairly similar in the two cases but that they can be very different from\nthose in the models mentioned above, giving important consequences for the\ntorque exerted on the central object. In particular we find that, contrary to\nwhat is usually thought, some regions of the disc outward of the co-rotation\npoint (rotating more slowly than the neutron star) may nevertheless contribute\nto spinning up the neutron star on account of the detailed structure of the\nmagnetic field in those parts of disc. \n\n"}

An \"off-axis\" GRB burst (i.e. whose relativistic jet points away\nfrom us) is expected to have late-time radio emission even in the absence of\nsignificant prompt gamma-ray emission. From our sample, we detected only SN\n2003gk with an 8.4-GHz flux density of $2260 \\pm 130 \\,\\mu$Jy.

This radius rules out relativistic expansion as expected for an\noff-axis GRB jet, and instead suggests an expansion speed of $\\sim 10\\:000$ km\ns$^{-1}$ typical for non-relativistic core-collapse supernovae. We attribute\nthe late-onset radio emission to interaction of the ejecta with a dense shell\ncaused by episodic mass-loss from the progenitor.\n  In addition, we present new calculations for the expected radio lightcurves\nfrom GRB jets at various angles to the line of sight, and compare these to our\nobserved limits on the flux densities of the remainder of our SN sample. From\nthis comparison we can say that only a fraction of broadlined Type I b/c SNe\nhave a radio-bright jet similar to those seen for GRB afterglows at\ncosmological distances.

The gamma-ray/radio-loud narrow-line active galactic nucleus (AGN) is\nlocated at redshift z=0.638. It is shining through an unrelated foreground\ngalaxy at z=0.500. The AGN light is likely amplified by a factor of a few\nbecause of gravitational lensing. The AGN SED shows a two-humped structure\ntypical of blazars and gamma-ray-loud NLSy1 galaxies, with the high-energy\n(inverse-Compton) emission dominating by more than an order of magnitude over\nthe low-energy (synchrotron) emission during gamma-ray flares. The difference\nbetween the two SED humps is smaller during the low-activity state. Fermi\nobservations reveal a strong correlation between the gamma-ray flux and\nspectral index, with the hardest spectrum observed during the brightest\ngamma-ray state. If the gamma-ray flux is a mixture of synchrotron self-Compton\n(SSC) and external Compton (EC) emission, the observed GeV spectral variability\nmay result from varying relative contributions of these two emission\ncomponents. \n\n"}

We\nestimate the possible growth rates and duty cycles of these episodes, both\nassuming slim accretion disk solutions, and adopting the results of recent\nnumerical simulations. The angular momentum of gas joining the accretion disk\ndetermines the length of the accretion episodes, and the final mass a MBH can\nreach. The latter can be related to the gas velocity dispersion, and in\ngalaxies with low-angular momentum gas the MBH can get to a higher mass. When\nthe host galaxy is able to sustain inflow rates at 1-100 msunyr, replenishing\nand circulation lead to a sequence of short (~1e4-1e7 years), heavily obscured\naccretion episodes that increase the growth rates, with respect to an\nEddington-limited case, by several orders of magnitude.

We perform a detailed study of the photosphere emission\nspectrum by progressively introducing several physical ingredients previously\nnot fully incorporated, including the probability distribution of the location\nof a dynamically evolving photosphere, superposition of emission from an\nequal-arrival-time ``volume'' in a continuous wind, the evolution of optical\ndepth of a wind with finite but evolving outer boundary, as well as the effect\nof different top-hat wind luminosity ($L_w$) profiles. By assuming a co-moving\nblackbody spectrum emerging from the photosphere, we find that for an outflow\nwith a constant or increasing $L_w$, the low-energy spectrum below the peak\nenergy ($E_{p}$), can be modified to $F_\\nu \\sim \\nu^{1.5}$ ($\\alpha \\sim\n+0.5$).

The r-mode interpretation has connections with proposed spin-evolution\nscenarios for systems such as XTE J1751-305. Here we examine in detail this\ninteresting possible interpretation. Using the ratio of the observed\noscillation frequency to the star's spin frequency, we derive an approximate\nneutron star mass-radius relation which yields reasonable values for the mass\nover the range of expected stellar radius (as constrained by observations of\nradius-expansion burst sources).

This allows us to study detailed spectra for over 11 ks,\ncompared to at most 100 s for regular bursts. A feature is present in the\nsuperburst spectra around 6.4 keV that is well fit with an emission line and an\nabsorption edge, suggestive of reflection of the superburst off the accretion\ndisk.

It has been shown\nthat it would be possible to throw a charged test particle into the near\nextremal rotating black hole and make it go past the extremality i.e. turn Kerr\nblack hole into the Kerr-Newmann naked singularity. Typically in an\nastrophysical scenario black holes are believed to be surrounded by a magnetic\nfield. Magnetic field although small, affects motion of charged particles\ndrastically due to the large Lorentz force, as the electromagnetic force is\nmuch stronger that the gravity. Thus a test magnetic field can affect the\nprocess of destroying black holes and restore the cosmic censorship in the\nastrophysical context.

We\ndescribe here a new method using time-delay lensed quasars where one or several\nimages are affected by microlensing due to stars in the lensing galaxy. Because\nmicrolensing decreases (or increases) the flux of the continuum compared to the\nbroad line region, it changes the contrast between these two emission\ncomponents. We show that this effect can be used to effectively disentangle the\nintrinsic variability of those two regions, offering the opportunity to perform\nreverberation mapping based on single band photometric data. Based on simulated\nlight curves generated using a damped random walk model of quasar variability,\nwe show that measurement of the size of the broad line region can be achieved\nusing this method, provided one spectrum has been obtained independently during\nthe monitoring.

We present a sample of sixteen published SLSN,\nfrom redshifts 0.1 to 1.2 and calculate accurate K-corrections to determine\nuniform magnitudes in two synthetic rest-frame filters with central wavelengths\nat 400nm and 520nm. At 400nm, we find a low scatter in their uncorrected, raw\nmean magnitudes with M(400)=-21.70 for the full sample of sixteen objects. We\ninvestigate the correlation between their decline rates and peak magnitude and\nfind that the brighter events appear to decline more slowly. We define a\n$\\Delta M(30)$ decay relation. This correlates peak magnitude and decline over\n30 days and can reduce the scatter to 0.25. We further show that M(400) appears\nto have a strong colour dependence. Using this colour rate decay relation, a\nlow scatter of between 0.19 and 0.26 can be found depending on sample\nselection. However we caution that only eight to ten objects currently have\nenough data to test this colour rate decline relation. We conclude that SLSN Ic\nare promising distance indicators at high redshift in regimes beyond those\npossible with SNe Ia.

We show\nthat in the hierarchical (in separation) three-body problem, one of the BHs and\na dark matter particle form an inner binary. Gravitational perturbations from\nthe BH companion, on a much wider orbit, can cause the dark matter particle to\nreach extremely high eccentricities and even get accreted onto the BH, by what\nis known as the Eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) mechanism. We show that this may\nproduce a torus-like configuration for the dark matter distribution around the\nless massive member of the BH binary. We first consider an Intermediate BH\n(IMBH) in the vicinity of our Galactic Center, which may be a relic of a past\nminor merger. We show that if the IMBH is close enough (i.e., near the stellar\ndisk) the EKL mechanism is very efficient in exciting the eccentricity of dark\nmatter particles in near-polar configurations to extremely high values where\nthey are accreted by the IMBH. We show that this mechanism is even more\neffective if the central BH grows in mass, where we have assumed adiabatic\ngrowth.

We suggest that if the BHs are spinning, the accreted\ndark matter particles may linger in the ergosphere and thereby may generate\nself-annihilations and produce an indirect signature of potential interest. \n\n"}

The historical evolution of the pulse phase\naveraged CRSF centroid energy Ecyc since its discovery in 1976 is characterized\nby an initial value around 35 keV, an abrupt jump upwards to beyond about 40\nkeV between 1990 and 1994, and an apparent decay thereafter.

Numerical simulations show that\nregions with strong turbulence (places for electron re-acceleration) are\nlocated high up in the Galactic Halo about several kpc above the disk.

In this model, a plasmoid (\"blob\") propagates\nrelativistically along the spine of a blazar jet and passes through a\nsynchrotron-emitting ring of electrons representing a shocked portion of the\njet sheath. This ring supplies a source of seed photons that are\ninverse-Compton scattered by the electrons in the moving blob.

In this work, the calculation is done up to the\nfourth post-Newtonian (4PN) order and to the sixth order of the eccentricity,\nincluding the effect of the absorption of gravitational waves by the black\nhole.

Such solutions have been proposed as exotic\nalternatives to the black-hole paradigm because they can be as compact as black\nholes and exist in any mass range. By constructing slowly-rotating, thin-shell\ngravastars to quadratic order in the spin, we compute the moment of inertia\n$I$, the mass quadrupole moment $Q$, and the tidal Love number $\\lambda$ in\nexact form.

The impact of the SN blast wave on the companion is followed by\nmeans of 3D SPH simulations using the Stellar GADGET code. For main-sequence\n(MS) companions, we find that the amount of removed mass, impact velocity, and\nchemical contamination of the companion that results from the impact of the SN\nejecta, strongly increases with decreasing binary separation and increasing\nexplosion energy. Their relationship can be approximately fitted by power laws,\nwhich is consistent with the results obtained from impact simulations of\nSNe~Ia.

The transition from a thin disk to an ADAF occurs when\nthe mass accretion rate is below a critical value. The critical mass accretion\nrate for the ADAF can be estimated by equating the equilibration timescale to\naccretion timescale of the ADAF, which is sensitive to its radial velocity. The\nradial velocity of thin disks is very small, which leads to the advection of\nthe external field in thin disks very inefficient. ADAFs are present in the\nlow/hard states of XRBs, and their radial velocity is large compared with the\nthin disk. The external field can be dragged inward efficiently by the ADAF, so\na strong large-scale magnetic field threading the ADAF can be formed, which may\naccelerate a fraction of gas in the ADAF into the outflows. Such outflows may\ncarry away a large amount of angular momentum from the ADAF, which increases\nthe radial velocity of the ADAF significantly. This leads to a high critical\nmass accretion rate, below which an ADAF with magnetic outflows can survive.\nOur calculations show that the critical luminosity of the ADAF with magnetic\noutflows can be one order of magnitude higher than that for a conventional\nADAF, if the ratio of gas to magnetic pressure $\\beta\\sim 4$ in the disk. This\ncan naturally explain the hysteretic state transition observed in XRBs. \n\n"}

In this paper, we propose that the cumulative TeV gamma-ray\nemission accompanying the production of neutrinos can be used to constrain the\ndistance of these neutrino sources, since the opacity of TeV gamma rays due to\nabsorption by the extragalactic background light (EBL) depends on the distance\nthat these TeV gamma rays have travelled. As the diffuse extragalactic TeV\nbackground measured by \\emph{Fermi} is much weaker than the expected cumulative\nflux associated with IceCube neutrinos, the majority of IceCube neutrinos, if\ntheir sources are transparent to TeV gamma rays, must come from distances\nlarger than the horizon of TeV gamma rays.

Elliptical galaxies are associated with groups, and BL-Lac\nobjects are typically hosted by them, so we decided to search for the host\ngroup of the blazar. For this, we performed optical spectroscopic observations\nof thirty objects in the field of view of PKS 1424+240 using the Gemini MOS.\nAfter analysing the data for groups, we evaluated the probability of finding\ngroups of galaxies by chance around the position of PKS 1424+240, using a deep\ncatalogue of groups.

This\nseparation occurs because the diffuse gas experiences ram pressure forces while\nthe effectively collisionless galaxies (and presumably their associated dark\nmatter halos) do not.

In one of the leading formation\nscenarios, a black hole of $\\sim100$ M$_{\\odot}$ results from the collapse of\nthe inner core of a supermassive star ($\\gtrsim 10^{4-5}$ M$_{\\odot}$), created\nby the rapid accumulation ($\\gtrsim 0.1 $ M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) of pristine\ngas at the centre of newly formed galaxies at $z\\sim 15$. The subsequent\nevolution is still speculative: the remaining gas in the supermassive star can\neither directly plunge into the nascent black hole, or part of it can form a\ncentral accretion disc, whose luminosity sustains a surrounding, massive, and\nnearly hydrostatic envelope (a system called a \"quasi-star\"). To address this\npoint, we consider the effect of rotation on a quasi-star, as angular momentum\nis inevitably transported towards the galactic nucleus by the accumulating gas.\nUsing a model for the internal redistribution of angular momentum that\nqualitative matches results from simulations of rotating convective stellar\nenvelopes, we show that quasi-stars with an envelope mass greater than a few\n$10^{5}$ M$_{\\odot} \\times (\\rm black~hole~mass/100 M_{\\odot})^{0.82}$ have\nhighly sub-keplerian gas motion in their core, preventing gas circularisation\noutside the black hole's horizon. Less massive quasi-stars could form but last\nfor only $\\lesssim 10^4$ years before the accretion luminosity unbinds the\nenvelope, suppressing the black hole growth. We speculate that this might\neventually lead to a dual black hole seed population: (i) massive ($>10^{4}$\nM$_{\\odot}$) seeds formed in the most massive ($> 10^{8}$ M$_{\\odot}$) and rare\nhaloes; (ii) lighter ($\\sim 10^{2}$ M$_{\\odot}$) seeds to be found in less\nmassive and therefore more common haloes. \n\n"}

In 2013, a near circumpolar balloon flight of 14\ndays duration was completed after launch from Esrange, Sweden, resulting in a\nmeasurement of the linear polarisation of the Crab emission. Building on the\nexperience gained from this Pathfinder flight, the polarimeter is being\nmodified to improve performance for a second flight in 2016.

These \"I-Love-Q\"\nrelations have important implications for astrophysics and gravitational-wave\nastronomy. An interesting problem is whether similar relations hold for other\ncompact objects and how they approach the black-hole limit. To answer these\nquestions, here we investigate the deformation properties of a large class of\nthin-shell gravastars, which are exotic compact objects that do not possess an\nevent horizon nor a spacetime singularity. Working in a small-spin and\nsmall-tidal field expansion, we calculate the moment of inertia, the quadrupole\nmoment, and the (quadrupolar electric) tidal Love number of gravastars with a\npolytropic thin shell. The I-Love-Q relations of a thin-shell gravastar are\ndrastically different from those of an ordinary neutron star.

The majority of bright extragalactic gamma-ray sources are blazars.\nOnly a few radio galaxies have been detected by Fermi/LAT. Recently, the\nGHz-peaked spectrum source PKS 1718-649 was confirmed to be gamma-ray bright,\nproviding further evidence for the existence of a population of gamma-ray loud,\ncompact radio galaxies. A spectral turnover in the radio spectrum in the MHz to\nGHz range is a characteristic feature of these objects, which are thought to be\nyoung due to their small linear sizes. The multiwavelength properties of the\ngamma-ray source PMN J1603-4904 suggest that it is a member of this source\nclass. Aims. The known radio spectrum of PMN J1603-4904 can be described by a\npower law above 1 GHz. Using observations from the Giant Metrewave Radio\nTelescope (GMRT) at 150, 325, and 610 MHz, we investigate the behaviour of the\nspectrum at lower frequencies to search for a low-frequency turnover. Methods.\nData from the TIFR GMRT Sky Survey (TGSS ADR) catalogue and archival GMRT\nobservations were used to construct the first MHz to GHz spectrum of PMN\nJ1603-4904. Results. We detect a low-frequency turnover of the spectrum and\nmeasure the peak position at about 490 MHz (rest-frame), which, using the known\nrelation of peak frequency and linear size, translates into a maximum linear\nsource size of ~1.4 kpc. Conclusions. The detection of the MHz peak indicates\nthat PMN J1603-4904 is part of this population of radio galaxies with turnover\nfrequencies in the MHz to GHz regime. Therefore it can be considered the\nsecond, confirmed object of this kind detected in gamma-rays. Establishing this\ngamma-ray source class will help to investigate the gamma-ray production sites\nand to test broadband emission models. \n\n"}

An important recent\ndevelopment for blazar science is the ability of Fermi-LAT spectroscopy to pin\ndown the shape of the distribution of the underlying non-thermal particle\npopulation. This paper highlights how multi-wavelength spectra spanning optical\nto X-ray to gamma-ray bands can be used to probe diffusive acceleration in\nrelativistic, oblique, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) shocks in blazar jets.\nDiagnostics on the MHD turbulence near such shocks are obtained using thermal\nand non-thermal particle distributions resulting from detailed Monte Carlo\nsimulations of DSA.

In a\ncompanion paper, we found steady-state solutions of the hydrodynamic equations\nthat are coupled to the CR energy equation for a large cluster sample. In those\nsolutions, radiative cooling in the central region is balanced by streaming CRs\nthrough the generation and dissipation of resonantly generated Alfv{\\'e}n waves\nand by thermal conduction at large radii. Here we demonstrate that the\npredicted non-thermal emission resulting from hadronic CR interactions in the\nintra-cluster medium exceeds observational radio (and gamma-ray) data in a\nsubsample of clusters that host radio mini halos (RMHs).

We observe three distinct drift modes whose \"vertical\" drift band\nseparations ($P_3$) and relative abundances are consistent with previous\nstudies at similar and higher frequencies.

X-ray observations conducted in 2013\nrevealed that MWC 656 is a quiescent high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB), opening the\npossibility to explore X-ray/radio correlations and the accretion/ejection\ncoupling down to low luminosities for BH HMXBs. Here we report on a deep joint\nChandra/VLA observation of MWC 656 (and contemporaneous optical data) conducted\nin 2015 July that has allowed us to unambiguously identify the X-ray\ncounterpart of the source. The X-ray spectrum can be fitted with a power law\nwith $\\Gamma\\sim2$, providing a flux of $\\simeq4\\times10^{-15}$ erg cm$^{-2}$\ns$^{-1}$ in the 0.5-8 keV energy range and a luminosity of $L_{\\rm\nX}\\simeq3\\times10^{30}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at a 2.6 kpc distance. For a 5 M$_\\odot$\nBH this translates into $\\simeq5\\times10^{-9}$ $L_{\\rm Edd}$. These results\nimply that MWC 656 is about 7 times fainter in X-rays than it was two years\nbefore and reaches the faintest X-ray luminosities ever detected in\nstellar-mass BHs. The radio data provide a detection with a peak flux density\nof $3.5\\pm1.1$ $\\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$.

In recent years, new surprising results\nwere discovered in X-ray data, ULX-pulsars and high-velocity outflows up to 0.2\nc. They are also in accordance with the super-Eddington accretion.

It is then important to study variations of evolutionary\nchannels for merging BHs, which might instead form accreting BHs and become\nULXs.

We study similar\nsystems by computing ~120000 detailed binary models with the MESA code covering\na wide range of initial parameters. For initial mass ratios M2/M1~0.1-0.4,\nprimaries >40Msun can evolve chemically homogeneously, remaining compact and\nforming a BH without undergoing Roche-lobe overflow.

We predict that ~1 out of\n10^4 massive stars evolves this way, and that in the local universe 0.13 ULXs\nper Msun yr^-1 of star-formation rate are observable, with a strong preference\nfor low-metallicities. At metallicities log Z>-3, BH masses in ULXs are limited\nto 60Msun due to the occurrence of pair-instability supernovae which leave no\nremnant, resulting in an X-ray luminosity cut-off. At lower metallicities, very\nmassive stars can avoid exploding as pair-instability supernovae and instead\nform BHs with masses above 130Msun, producing a gap in the ULX luminosity\ndistribution. After the ULX phase, neutron-star-BH binaries that merge in less\nthan a Hubble time are produced with a formation rate <0.2 Gpc^-3 yr^-1.

Luminous red galaxies and galaxy clusters probe the\nmatter power spectrum on overlapping scales (0.02 Mpc$^{-1}$ < k < 0.7\nMpc$^{-1}$ [9-18]), while the Lyman-alpha forest reaches slightly smaller\nscales (0.3 Mpc$^{-1} < k < 3$ Mpc$^{-1}$; [19]).

Instead, there are many contributing factors, ram\npressure being only one of them, but the dominant factor is turbulent\ndissipation (TD). Primarily, TD provides extra heating, adding significant\nthermal pressure, and reducing the condition for explosion.

In this article I\nshow that the glitch-events observed in pulsars are exact quantum signatures\nfor their metamorphosis into dark super-baryons (SBs), whose interiors are made\nof purely incompressible superconducting gluon-quark superfluids. Here the\nquantum nuclear shell model is adopted to describe the permitted energy levels\nof the SB, which are assumed to be identical to the discrete spinning rates\n$\\Omega_{SB},$ that SBs are allowed to rotate with. Accordingly, a glitch-event\ncorresponds to a prompt spin-down of the superconducting SB from one energy\nlevel to the next, thereby expelling a certain number of vortices, which in\nturn spins-up the ambient medium. The process is provoked mainly by the\nnegative torque of the ambient dissipative nuclear fluid and by a universal\nscalar field $\\phi$ at the background of a supranuclear dense matter. As\ndictated by the Onsager-Feynman equation, the prompt spin-down must be\nassociated with increase of the dimensions of the embryonic SB to finally\nconvert the entire pulsar into SB-Objects on the scale of Gyrs. Based on our\ncalculations, a Vela-like pulsar should display billions of glitches during its\nlifetime, before it metamorphoses entirely into a maximally compact SB-object\nand disappears from our observational windows.

A white noise power spectral density (PSD) is expected at low\nfrequency in this model, however, direct observational constraint to the low\nfrequency PSD slope is hard due to limited lengths of the light curves\navailable.

In fact, the standard SHP,\nwhere the DM particle, $S$, only has renormalizable interactions with the\nHiggs, is non-operational due to strong constraints, specially from DM direct\ndetection limits.

During this period, Cygnus X-3 is in a so-called\nhypersoft state, where the radio and hard X-ray fluxes are found to be at their\nlowest values (or non-detected), the soft X-ray flux is at its highest values,\nand sporadic gamma-ray emission is observed.

Approximately after half of the\nlight curves, the correlation between the broad emission lines and the\nlag-corrected ultraviolet continua becomes weak. This anomalous behavior is\naccompanied by an increase of soft X-ray emission. We propose a simple model to\nunderstand this anomalous behavior, i.e., the corona might fall down, thereby\nincreasing the covering fraction of the inner disk. Therefore, X-ray and\nextreme ultraviolet emission suffer from spectral variations. The ultraviolet\ncontinua variations are driven by both X-ray and extreme ultraviolet\nvariations. Consequently, the spectral variability induced by the falling\ncorona would dilute the correlation between the broad emission lines and the\nultraviolet continua. Our model can explain many additional observational\nfacts, including the dependence of the anomalous behavior on velocity and\nionization energy.

We aim at independently\ndetermining the magnetic activity cycle of HR 1099 using archival X-ray data to\nallow for a comparison to orbital period variations. Archival X-ray data from\n80 different observations of HR 1099 acquired with 12 different X-ray\nfacilities and covering almost four decades were used to determine X-ray fluxes\nin the energy range of 2-10 keV via spectral fitting and flux conversion.

We do not detect any statistically\nsignificant periodicities within the X-ray data. An analysis of optical data of\nHR 1099 shows that the derivation of such periods is strongly dependent on the\ntime coverage of available data, since the observed optical variations strongly\ndeviate from a pure sine wave. We argue that this offers an explanation as to\nwhy other authors derive such a wide range of activity cycle periods based on\noptical data.

The\ninformation about the size of the source emerges via the neutrino equivalent of\nintensity interferometry originally used by Hanbury-Brown and Twiss with\nphotons to measure the radii of stars. However the analytic demonstration of\nneutrino intensity interferometry with supernova neutrinos made a number of\napproximations: that the two neutrinos had equal energies, the neutrinos were\nemitted at simultaneous times from two points and were detected simultaneously\nat two detection points that formed a plane with the emission points. These\napproximations need to be relaxed in order to better determine the feasibility\nof neutrino intensity interferometry for supernovae neutrinos in a more\nrealistic scenario. In this paper we further investigate the feasibility of\nintensity interferometry for supernova neutrinos by relaxing all the\napproximations made in the earlier study. We find that, while relaxing any one\nassumption reduces the correlation signal, the relaxation of the assumption of\nequal times of detection is by far the largest detrimental factor. For neutrino\nenergies of order $\\sim$15 MeV and a supernova distance of L = 10 kpc, we show\nthat in order to observe the interference pattern in the two-point correlation\nfunction of the neutrino pairs, the timing resolution of a detector needs to be\non the order of $\\lesssim 10^{-21}\\;{\\rm s}$ if the initial neutrino wave\npacket has a size of $\\sigma_x \\sim 10^{-11}\\;{\\rm cm}$. \n\n"}

While attractive for its\nsimplicity, the SLIM disk solution is challenged by the latest generation of\nthree-dimensional radiation (magneto)-hydrodynamical simulations, in which\nradiative losses can be an order of magnitude higher, and the mechanisms of\nradiation transport is more complex than straight advection as it takes place\nin a complex turbulent regime.

With particle-in-cell simulations, we study decaying turbulence in\nmagnetically-dominated (or equivalently, \"relativistic\") pair plasmas. We find\nthat the generation of a power-law particle energy spectrum is a generic\nby-product of relativistic turbulence. The power-law slope is harder for higher\nmagnetizations and stronger turbulence levels. In large systems, the slope\nattains an asymptotic, system-size-independent value, while the high-energy\nspectral cutoff increases linearly with system size; both the slope and the\ncutoff do not depend on the dimensionality of our domain. By following a large\nsample of particles, we show that particle injection happens at reconnecting\ncurrent sheets; the injected particles are then further accelerated by\nstochastic interactions with turbulent fluctuations.

Two processes that are commonly considered (e.g., for sub-grid\nprescriptions) are Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion and the Eddington limit. A\nthird one is AGN wind feedback. It has been long suggested that such a wind\nfeedback regulates the final SMBH mass, however, it has been shown recently\nthat AGN winds can also regulate the average accretion rate at a level\nconsistent with observations of high redshift AGNs. In this paper we study the\neffect of wind feedback on the accretion rate using 2D, high resolution\nhydrodynamic simulations, that incorporate a self-consistent wind injection\nscheme and resolves the SMBH sphere of influence. Two different cases are\nexplored and compared: one in which the initial gas density is uniform, and one\nin which it has an isothermal sphere profile. We also compare simulations with\nand without cooling. Our main finding is that for reasonable parameters, AGN\nfeedback always limits the accretion rate to be far below the\nBondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton limit. For typical wind parameters and a uniform ISM\ndensities of the order $1 {cm}^{-3}$, the accretion rate is found to be several\norders of magnitudes smaller than that inferred in large samples of high\nredshift AGNs. On the other hand, the accretion rate obtained for initially\nisothermal density profile is found to be consistent with the observations,\nparticularly when cooling is included. Furthermore, it roughly scales as\n$\\sigma^{5}$ with the velocity dispersion of the bulge, in accord with the\n$M-\\sigma$ relation. \n\n"}

LIGO/Virgo estimated that local cosmic NS-NS merger rate is 110-3840\nGpc^-3 yr^-1. Only some extreme evolutionary models can generate NS-NS merger\nrates in old host galaxies consistent with the LIGO/Virgo estimate. However, we\nshow that these models generate rates exceeding empirical Galactic NS-NS merger\nrates based on the large population of Milky Way NS-NS binaries. Typically,\ncurrent evolutionary models produce NS-NS merger rates that are consistent with\nthe Milky Way empirical rates. However, these models generate local cosmic\nNS-NS merger rate in old host galaxies that are below the LIGO/Virgo estimate.\nThe reason behind this tension is the predicted delay time distribution between\nstar formation and NS-NS mergers that favors short delays. Evolutionary models\nproduce a generic steep power-law NS-NS delay time distribution. This limits\nNS-NS merger rates in old host galaxies. However, we show that such\ndistribution is consistent with observations of Galactic NS-NS binaries; 50% of\nwhich show very long merger times (much longer than Hubble time).

We find that SC dynamics does not affect the merger rate\nsignificantly, but leaves a strong fingerprint on the properties of merging\nBBHs. More than 50 % of merging BBHs in young SCs form by dynamical exchanges\nin the first few Myr. Dynamically formed merging BBHs are significantly heavier\nthan merging BBHs in isolated binaries: merging BBHs with total mass up to\n$\\sim{}120$ M$_\\odot$ form in young SCs, while the maximum total mass of\nmerging BBHs in isolated binaries with the same metallicity is only $\\sim{}70$\nM$_\\odot$.

Understanding the progenitors and the\nmechanism driving SN Ic-bl explosions vs those of their SNe Ic cousins is key\nto understanding the SN-GRB relationship and jet production in massive stars.\nHere we present the largest set of host-galaxy spectra of 28 SNe Ic and 14 SN\nIc-bl, all discovered before 2013 by the same untargeted survey, namely the\nPalomar Transient Factory (PTF). We carefully measure their gas-phase\nmetallicities, stellar masses (M*s) and star-formation rates (SFRs) by taking\ninto account recent progress in the metallicity field and propagating\nuncertainties correctly. We further re-analyze the hosts of 10 literature\nSN-GRBs using the same methods and compare them to our PTF SN hosts with the\ngoal of constraining their progenitors from their local environments by\nconducting a thorough statistical comparison, including upper limits. We find\nthat the metallicities, SFRs and M*s of our PTF SN Ic-bl hosts are\nstatistically comparable to those of SN-GRBs, but significantly lower than\nthose of the PTF SNe Ic. The mass-metallicity relations as defined by the SNe\nIc-bl and SN-GRBs are not significantly different from the same relations as\ndefined by the SDSS galaxies, in contrast to claims by earlier works. Our\nfindings point towards low metallicity as a crucial ingredient for SN Ic-bl and\nSN-GRB production since we are able to break the degeneracy between high SFR\nand low metallicity. We suggest that the PTF SNe Ic-bl may have produced jets\nthat were choked inside the star or were able break out of the star as unseen\nlow-luminosity or off-axis GRBs. \n\n"}

If we assume the\nblack hole accretes at Bondi accretion rate and radiates at efficiency of\nlow-luminosity hot accretion flow, the predicted nuclei luminosity can be\nsignificantly higher than observations. Therefore, the real black hole mass\naccretion rate in these sources may be significantly smaller than the Bondi\nvalue. Active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback may be responsible for decreasing\nblack hole accretion rate to values much smaller than Bondi rate. We perform\ntwo-dimensional simulations of low angular momentum accretion flow at parsec\nand sub-parsec scales around low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs). We\ntake into account the radiation and wind feedbacks of the LLAGN. The cross\nsection of particle-particle interaction can be several orders of magnitude\nlarger than that of photon-particle interaction. Therefore, we find that for\nthe LLAGNs, effects of radiation feedback in decreasing black hole accretion\nrate are small. However, wind feedback can effectively decrease the black hole\nmass accretion rate. Due to the decrease of accretion rate, the black hole\nluminosity can be decreased by a factor of $\\sim 33-400$.

Abstract: Mass accretion rate is a key parameter in accretion disk theory. It\ndetermines black hole accretion mode. In large scale cosmological simulations\nstudying galaxy formation and evolution, Bondi radius can at most be marginally\nresolved. In those simulations, Bondi accretion formula is always used to\nestimate black hole accretion rate. Bondi solution is too simple, which cannot\nrepresent the real accretion process. We perform simulations of hot accretion\nflow at parsec scale irradiated by a low luminosity active galactic nucleus\n(AGN). We perform 77 simulations with varying density and temperature at outer\nboundary (10 parsec). Our purpose is to find a formula to calculate real black\nhole accretion rate based on the gas density and temperature at parsec scale.\nWe define Eddington accretion rate to be $\\dot M_{\\rm Edd}=10L_{\\rm Edd}/c^2$,\nwith $L_{\\rm Edd}$ and $c$ been Eddington luminosity and speed of light\nrespectively.

As a motivating example, we consider the problem of wireless network\nselection. Mobile devices are often required to choose the right network to\nassociate with for optimal performance, which is non-trivial. The excellent\ntheoretical properties of EXP3, a leading multi-armed bandit algorithm, suggest\nthat it should work well for this type of problem. Yet, it performs poorly in\npractice. A major limitation is its slow rate of stabilization. Bandit-style\nalgorithms perform better when global knowledge is available, i.e., when\ndevices receive feedback about all networks after each selection. But,\nunfortunately, communicating full information to all devices is expensive.\nTherefore, we address the question of how much information is adequate to\nachieve better performance. We propose Co-Bandit, a novel cooperative bandit\napproach, that allows devices to occasionally share their observations and\nforward feedback received from neighbors; hence, feedback may be received with\na delay. Devices perform network selection based on their own observation and\nfeedback from neighbors. As such, they speed up each other's rate of learning.\nWe prove that Co-Bandit is regret-minimizing and retains the convergence\nproperty of multiplicative weight update algorithms with full information.\nThrough simulation, we show that a very small amount of information, even with\na delay, is adequate to nudge each other to select the right network and yield\nsignificantly faster stabilization at the optimal state (about 630x faster than\nEXP3). \n\n"}
