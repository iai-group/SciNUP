{"id": "1310.3682", "contents": "Title: Lattice cohomology and Seiberg-Witten invariants of normal surface\n  singularities Abstract: One of the main questions in the theory of normal surface singularities is to\nunderstand the relations between their geometry and topology. The lattice\ncohomology is an important tool in the study of topological properties of a\nplumbed 3-manifold M associated with a connected negative definite plumbing\ngraph G. It connects the topological properties with analytic ones when M is\nrealized as a singularity link, i.e. when G is a good resolution graph of the\nsingularity. Its computation is based on the (Riemann-Roch) weights of the\nlattice points of \\Z^s, where s is the number of vertices of G. The first part\nof the thesis reduces the rank of this lattice to the number of `bad' vertices\nof the graph. Usually, the geometry/topology of M is encoded exactly by these\n`bad' vertices and their number measures how far the plumbing graph stays from\na rational one. In the second part, we identify the following three objects:\nthe Seiberg-Witten invariant of a plumbed 3-manifold, the periodic constant of\nits topological Poincare series, and a coefficient of an equivariant\nmultivariable Ehrhart polynomial. For this, we construct the corresponding\npolytope from the plumbing graph, together with an action of H_1(M,\\Z), and we\ndevelop Ehrhart theory for them. The effect of the reduction appears also at\nthe level of the multivariable topological Poincare series, simplifying the\ncorresponding polytope and the Ehrhart theory as well.

Further, the structure constants for\nthe multiplication rule in this basis should be given by counting broken lines\n(certain combinatorial objects, morally the tropicalisations of holomorphic\ndiscs). Here we prove the conjecture in the case of cluster varieties, where\nthe statement is a more precise form of the Fock-Goncharov dual basis\nconjecture. In particular, under suitable hypotheses, for each Y the partial\ncompactification of an affine cluster variety U given by allowing some frozen\nvariables to vanish, we obtain canonical bases for the ring of functions on Y\nextending to a basis for functions on U. Each choice of seed canonically\nidentifies the parameterizing sets of these bases with integral points in a\npolyhedral cone.

A decomposition\nspace is a simplicial $\\infty$-groupoid satisfying an exactness condition\nweaker than the Segal condition. Just as the Segal condition expresses\ncomposition, the new condition expresses decomposition. In this paper, we\nintroduce various technical conditions on decomposition spaces. The first is a\ncompleteness condition (weaker than Rezk completeness), needed to control\nsimplicial nondegeneracy. For complete decomposition spaces we establish a\ngeneral M\\\"obius inversion principle, expressed as an explicit equivalence of\n$\\infty$-groupoids. Next we analyse two finiteness conditions on decomposition\nspaces. The first, that of locally finite length, guarantees the existence of\nthe important length filtration on the associated incidence coalgebra. We show\nthat a decomposition space of locally finite length is actually the left Kan\nextension of a semi-simplicial space. The second finiteness condition, local\nfiniteness, ensures we can take homotopy cardinality to pass from the level of\n$\\infty$-groupoids to the level of vector spaces. These three conditions -\ncompleteness, locally finite length, and local finiteness - together define our\nnotion of M\\\"obius decomposition space, which extends Leroux's notion of\nM\\\"obius category (in turn a common generalisation of the locally finite posets\nof Rota et al. and of the finite decomposition monoids of Cartier-Foata), but\nwhich also covers many coalgebra constructions which do not arise from M\\\"obius\ncategories, such as the Fa\\`a di Bruno and Connes-Kreimer bialgebras.

By\ncompactness arguments, local finiteness guarantees several regularity\nproperties. It is generally easy to find counterexamples to such regularity\nresults when the assumption of local finiteness is dropped. The present work\nfocuses on the following problem: determining whether these regularity\nproperties still hold when local finiteness is replaced by an assumption of\ntransitivity.\n  After recalling the locally finite situation, we show that there are Cayley\ngraphs with infinite generating systems that have infinite diameter but do not\ncontain any infinite geodesic ray. We also introduce a notion of generalised\ndiameter. The generalised diameter of a graph is either an ordinal or \"truly\ninfinite\" and captures the extension properties of geodesic paths. It is a\nfinite ordinal if and only if the usual diameter is finite, and in that case\nthe two notions agree. Besides, the generalised diameter is \"truly infinite\" if\nand only if the considered graph contains an infinite geodesic ray.

Part 1: Foundations Abstract: We initiate the study of higher dimensional topological finiteness properties\nof monoids. This is done by developing the theory of monoids acting on CW\ncomplexes. For this we establish the foundations of $M$-equivariant homotopy\ntheory where $M$ is a discrete monoid. For projective $M$-CW complexes we prove\nseveral fundamental results such as the homotopy extension and lifting\nproperty, which we use to prove the $M$-equivariant Whitehead theorems. We\ndefine a left equivariant classifying space as a contractible projective $M$-CW\ncomplex. We prove that such a space is unique up to $M$-homotopy equivalence\nand give a canonical model for such a space via the nerve of the right Cayley\ngraph category of the monoid. The topological finiteness conditions\nleft-$\\mathrm{F}_n$ and left geometric dimension are then defined for monoids\nin terms of existence of a left equivariant classifying space satisfying\nappropriate finiteness properties.

Using the recognition principle of Fiedorowicz, we prove\nthat spineless cacti are equivalent as operads to the little discs operad. It\nturns out that in terms of spineless cacti Cohen's Gerstenhaber structure and\nFiedorowicz' braided operad structure are given by the same explicit chains. We\nalso prove that spineless cacti and cacti are homotopy equivalent to their\nnormalized versions as quasi-operads by showing that both types of cacti are\nsemi-direct products of the quasi-operad of their normalized versions with a\nre-scaling operad based on R>0. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of\nbi-crossed products of quasi-operads and show that the cacti proper are a\nbi-crossed product of the operad of cacti without spines and the operad based\non the monoid given by the circle group S^1.

We call this the diagonal property (D). It was known that it holds\nfor all flag manifolds ${\\rm SL}_n/P$.\n  We consider mainly the cases of proper smooth varieties, and the analogous\nproblems for smooth manifolds (the topological case).\n  Our main new observation in the case of proper varieties is a relation\nbetween (D) and cohomologically trivial line bundles on $X$, obtained by a\nvariation of Serre's classic argument relating rank 2 vector bundles and\ncodimension 2 subschemes, combined with Serre duality. Based on this, we have\nseveral detailed results on surfaces, and some results in higher dimensions.\n  For smooth affine varieties, we observe that for an affine algebraic group\nover an algebraically closed field, the diagonal is in fact a complete\nintersection; thus (D) holds, using the trivial bundle. We conjecture the\nexistence of smooth affine complex varieties for which (D) fails; this leads to\nan interesting question on projective modules.\n  The arguments in the topological case have a different flavour, with\narguments from homotopy theory, topological K-theory, index theory etc. There\nare 3 variants of the diagonal problem, depending on the type of vector bundle\nwe want (arbitrary, oriented or complex). We obtain a homotopy theoretic\nreformulation of the diagonal property as an extension problem for a certain\nhomotopy class of maps. We also have detailed results in several cases:\nspheres, odd dimensional complex projective quadric hypersurfaces, and\nmanifolds of even dimension $\\leq 6$ with an almost complex structure. \n\n"}

At the\nheart of the memoir, we introduce and study a poset $NC^{(k)}(W)$ for each\nfinite Coxeter group $W$ and for each positive integer $k$. When $k=1$, our\ndefinition coincides with the generalized noncrossing partitions introduced by\nBrady-Watt and Bessis. When $W$ is the symmetric group, we obtain the poset of\nclassical $k$-divisible noncrossing partitions, first studied by Edelman.\n  Along the way, we include a comprehensive introduction to related background\nmaterial. Before defining our generalization $NC^{(k)}(W)$, we develop from\nscratch the theory of algebraic noncrossing partitions $NC(W)$. This involves\nstudying a finite Coxeter group $W$ with respect to its generating set $T$ of\n{\\em all} reflections, instead of the usual Coxeter generating set $S$.

In\nparticular, there is a generalized ``Fuss-Catalan number'', with a nice closed\nformula in terms of the invariant degrees of $W$, that plays an important role\nin each case. We give a basic introduction to these topics, and we describe\nseveral conjectures relating these three families of ``Fuss-Catalan objects''. \n\n"}
