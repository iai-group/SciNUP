In the region of the parameter space probed\nby NA62 the contribution from a bino-stau loop diagram is numerically dominant\nand the mixing between left-handed and right-handed staus is important. For\nlarge values of the stau mixing angle theta_tau the commonly adopted mass\ninsertion approximation is not accurate. We therefore express the\nsupersymmetric contribution to R_K in terms of the mass of the lightest stau\neigenstate, the mixing angle theta_tau, and other relevant MSSM parameter such\nas tan(beta) and the charged-Higgs boson mass M_H and plot the parameter\nregions constrained by R_K. We further study to which extent R_K can be\ndepleted through MSSM contributions interfering destructively with the SM\namplitude for K -> e nu_e. This lepton-flavour conserving (LFC) mechanism\ninvolves the parameter combination |delta_{LL}^{13} delta_{RR}^{13}|, which can\nbe constrained with a naturalness consideration for the electron mass or with\nthe measurement of the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron. The LFC\neffect on R_K is marginal, an NA62 measurement of R_K significantly below the\nStandard Model expectation would indicate physics beyond the MSSM. \n\n"}

We discuss\nprevious attempts to extract the WIMP mass, cross-section and speed\ndistribution from direct detection data and show that these lead to significant\nbiases in the reconstructed parameter values. We develop and test an\nalternative model-independent method based on parametrising the momentum\ndistribution of the WIMPs.

The method\ncan be applied to a single experiment to extract information about the\ndistribution function, as well as information on the degenerate WIMP mass and\ninteraction cross-section combined in a single parameter. This degeneracy can\nbe broken by including data from additional experiments, meaning that the WIMP\nmass and speed distribution can be recovered.

At lower latitudes (b < 20 degrees), in\ncontrast, the spectrum of the emission correlated with the Bubbles possesses a\npronounced spectral feature peaking at 1-4 GeV (in E^2 dN/dE) which cannot be\ngenerated by any realistic spectrum of electrons. Instead, we conclude that a\nsecond (non-inverse-Compton) emission mechanism must be responsible for the\nbulk of the low-energy, low-latitude emission. This second component is\nspectrally similar to the excess GeV emission previously reported from the\nGalactic Center (GC), and also appears spatially consistent with a luminosity\nper volume falling approximately as r^-2.4, where r is the distance from the\nGC.

The same term also affects\nthe effective coupling of the Higgs boson to diphoton through a one-loop\ndiagram with the charged scalar.

Since most LHC searches are designed with this\nexpectation, the putative bounds on sparticle masses become considerably weaker\nif R-parity is violated so that squarks and gluinos decay to jets with large\nQCD backgrounds. Here we introduce a scenario in which baryonic R-parity\nviolation (RPV) arises effectively from soft SUSY-breaking interactions, but\nleptonic RPV remains accidentally forbidden to evade constraints from proton\ndecay and FCNCs. The model features a global R-symmetry that initially forbids\nRPV interactions, a hidden R-breaking sector, and a heavy mediator that\ncommunicates this breaking to the visible sector. After R-symmetry breaking,\nthe mediator is integrated out and an effective RPV A-term arises at tree\nlevel; RPV couplings between quarks and squarks arise only at loop level and\nreceive additional suppression. Although this mediator must be heavy compared\nto soft masses, the model introduces no new hierarchy since viable RPV can\narise when the mediator mass is near the SUSY breaking scale. In generic\nregions of parameter space, a light thermally-produced gravitino is stable and\ncan be a viable dark matter candidate. \n\n"}

Lojasiewicz proved this result in the early 1960s as\na consequence of his gradient inequality.\n  Many problems in calculus of variations are questions about critical points\nor gradient flow lines of an infinite dimensional functional. Perhaps\nsurprisingly, even blowups at singularities of many nonlinear PDE's can, in a\ncertain sense, be thought of as limits of infinite dimensional gradient flows\nof analytic functionals. Thus, the question of uniqueness of blowups can be\napproached as an infinite dimensional version of Lojasiewicz's theorem. The\nquestion of uniqueness of blowups is perhaps the most fundamental question\nabout singularities.\n  This approach to uniqueness was pioneered by Leon Simon thirty years ago for\nthe area functional and many related functionals using an elaborate reduction\nto a finite dimensional setting where Lojasiewicz's arguments applied.\n  Recently, the authors proved two new infinite dimensional Lojasiewicz\ninequalities at noncompact singularities where it was well-known that a\nreduction to Lojasiewicz's arguments is not possible, but instead entirely new\ntechniques are required. As a consequence, the authors settled a major\nlong-standing open question about uniqueness of blowups for mean curvature flow\nat all generic singularities and for mean convex mean curvature flow at all\nsingularities. Using this, the authors have obtained a rather complete\ndescription of the space-time singular set for MCF with generic singularities.\nIn particular, the singular set of a MCF in $\\bf{R}^{n+1}$ with only generic\nsingularities is contained in finitely many compact Lipschitz submanifolds of\ndimension at most $n-1$ together with a set of dimension at most $n-2$. \n\n"}

This scenario is realized in the recently proposed\nmechanism of baryogenesis where the baryon asymmetry is produced through the\nfreeze-out and subsequent decay of a meta-stable weakly interacting massive\nparticle (\"WIMP baryogenesis\"). In analogy to missing energy searches for WIMP\ndark matter, the LHC is an excellent probe of these new long-lived particles\nresponsible for baryogenesis via the low-background displaced vertex channel.\nIn our paper, we estimate the limits on simplified models inspired by WIMP\nbaryogenesis from two of the most sensitive collider searches by CMS and ATLAS\nwith 8 TeV LHC data.

In particular, simple models of\nthis type can explain the gamma ray excess originating in the Galactic Center\nas observed by the Fermi Large Area Telescope. In many cases the pseudoscalar's\nbranching ratio into WIMPs is suppressed, making these states challenging to\ndetect at colliders through standard dark matter searches. Here, we study the\nprospects for observing these light mediator states at the LHC without\nexploiting missing energy techniques. While existing searches effectively probe\npseudoscalars with masses between 5 - 14 GeV and above 90 GeV, the LHC reach\ncan be extended to cover much of the interesting parameter space in the\nintermediate 20 - 80 GeV mass range in which the mediator can have appreciable\nYukawa-like couplings to Standard Model fermions but would have escaped\ndetection by LEP and other experiments.

We present an attempt, by developing\nproper-time $\\tau$ quantum mechanics on a multi-quark system in particle frame\n(with constant boost velocity $\\boldsymbol{v}$). We start from the variational\nmethod on a classical mechanics action where a constituent quark has Pauli-type\n$SU(2)_{\\sigma}$ spin.

Similar to the loop-induced Higgs decay channels $H\\to\n\\gamma\\gamma, Z\\gamma$, the $e^+e^-\\to H\\gamma$ process also starts at one-loop\norder provided that the tiny electron mass is neglected. In this work, we\ncalculate the next-to-leading-order (NLO) QCD corrections to this associated\n$H+\\gamma$ production process, which mainly stem from the gluonic dressing to\nthe top quark loop. The QCD corrections are found to be rather modest at lower\ncenter-of-mass energy range ($\\sqrt{s}<300$ GeV), thus of negligible impact on\nHiggs factory such as CEPC. Nevertheless, when the energy is boosted to the ILC\nenergy range ($\\sqrt{s}\\approx 400$ GeV), QCD corrections may enhance the\nleading-order cross section by $20\\%$.

The model contains a light scalar field\nwhich coherently oscillates in the early Universe and modulates the Majorana\nmass of the sterile neutrino. In a region of model parameter space, the\noscillations between active and sterile neutrinos are resonantly enhanced. This\nmechanism allows us to produce sterile neutrino DM with small mixing angle with\nactive neutrinos, thus evading the X-ray constraints. At the same time the\nspectrum of produced DM is much cooler, than in the case of ordinary\noscillations in plasma, opening a window of lower mass DM, which is otherwise\nforbidden by structure formation considerations. In other regions of the model\nparameter space, where the resonance does not appear, another mechanism can\noperate: large field suppresses the active-sterile oscillations, but instead\nsterile neutrinos are produced by the oscillating scalar field when the\neffective fermion mass crosses zero.

In the early Universe, decays of a long\nlived particle produce $B$ mesons and anti-mesons out of thermal equilibrium.\nThese mesons/anti-mesons then undergo CP violating oscillations before quickly\ndecaying into visible and dark sector particles. Dark matter will be charged\nunder Baryon number so that the visible sector baryon asymmetry is produced\nwithout violating the total baryon number of the Universe. The produced baryon\nasymmetry will be directly related to the leptonic charge asymmetry in neutral\n$B$ decays; an experimental observable.

The resulting finite contributions to the energy density and the\npressure from the quantum vacuum grow as log a(t) where a(t) is the scale\nfactor, while the particle contributions dilute as 1/a^3(t), as it must be for\nmassive particles. The DE equation of state P = w(z)H turns to be w(z)<-1 with\nw(z) asymptotically reaching the value -1 from below.A scalar particle can\nproduce the observed DE through its quantum cosmological vacuum provided:(i)its\nmass is of the order of 10^{-3} eV = 1 meV,(ii) it is very weakly coupled and\n(iii) it is stable on the time scale of the age of the universe.

In\nlittle Higgs theories, the Higgs mass-squareds are protected to the one-loop\norder from the quadratic divergence. This allows the cutoff to be raised up to\n\\~10 TeV, beyond the scales probed by the precision data. However, strong\nconstraints can still arise from the contributions of the new TeV scale\nparticles and hence re-introduces the fine-tuning problem. In this paper we\nshow that a new symmetry, denoted as T-parity, under which all heavy gauge\nbosons and scalar triplets are odd, can remove all the tree-level contributions\nto the electroweak observables and therefore makes the little Higgs theories\ncompletely natural. The T-parity can be manifestly implemented in a majority of\nlittle Higgs models by following the most general construction of the low\nenergy effective theory a la Callan, Coleman, Wess and Zumino.

The Hestenesian 'dot' product, extending the\none-vector scalar product, is even worse having exceptions for scalars and the\nneed for applying grade operators at various times. Moreover, the multivector\ngrade is not a generic Clifford algebra concept. The situation becomes even\nworse in geometric applications if a meet, join or contractions have to be\ncalculated.\n  Starting from a naturally graded Grassmann Hopf gebra, we derive general\nformulae for the products: meet and join, comeet and cojoin, left/right\ncontraction, left/right cocontraction, Clifford and co-Clifford products. All\nthese product formulae are valid for any grade and any inhomogeneous\nmultivector factors in Clifford algebras of any bilinear form, including\nnon-symmetric and degenerated forms. We derive the three well known Chevalley\nformulae as a specialization of our approach and will display co-Chevalley\nformulae. The Rota--Stein cliffordization is shown to be the generalization of\nChevalley deformation. Our product formulae are based on invariant theory and\nare not tied to representations/matrices and are highly computationally\neffective.

The ultimate purpose\nof the gluing theorem is to provide topological models for neighborhoods of\nideal Seiberg-Witten moduli spaces appearing in lower levels of the Uhlenbeck\ncompactification of the moduli space of PU(2) monopoles and thus permit\ncalculations of their contributions to Donaldson invariants using the\nPU(2)-monopole cobordism. \n\n"}

I Abstract: This is the first of a series of papers devoted to the study of classical\ninitial-boundary value problems of Dirichlet, Neumann and mixed type for the\nNonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation on the segment. Considering proper periodic\ndiscontinuous extensions of the profile, generated by suitable point-like\nsources, we show that the above boundary value problems can be rewritten as\nnonlinear dynamical systems for suitable sets of algebro-geometric spectral\ndata, generalizing the classical Dubrovin equations.\n  In this paper we consider, as a first illustration of the above method, the\ncase of the Dirichlet problem on the segment with zero-boundary value at one\nend, and we show that the corresponding dynamical system for the spectral data\ncan be written as a system of ODEs with algebraic right-hand side. \n\n"}

In this scenario, near chiral\nrestoration, the vector meson masses drop to zero {\\it in the chiral limit}\nwith vanishing widths. This scenario appears to differ from the standard linear\nsigma model scenario. We exploit a link between the VM and color-flavor locking\ninferred by us from lattice data on quark number susceptibility (QNS) measured\nas a function of temperature to suggest that local flavor symmetry gets mapped\nto color gauge symmetry at the chiral phase transition. \n\n"}

The field equation\nis propagated until full decoupling has occurred and the asymptotic many-body\nstate of free pions is then obtained by a suitable Fourier decomposition of the\nfield and a subsequent stochastic determination of the number of quanta in each\nelementary mode. The resulting transverse pion spectrum exhibits visible\nenhancements below 200 MeV due to the parametric amplification caused by the\noscillatory relaxation of the chiral order parameter. Ensembles of such final\nstates are subjected to various event-by-event analyses. The factorial moments\nof the multiplicity distribution suggest that the soft pions are\nnon-statistical. Furthermore, their emission patterns exhibit azimuthal\ncorrelations that have a bearing on the domain size in the source. Finally, the\ndistribution of the neutral pion fraction shows a significant broadening for\nthe soft pions which grows steadily as the number of azimuthal segments is\nincreased. All of these features are indicative of disoriented chiral\ncondensates and it may be interesting to apply similar analyses to actual data\nfrom high-energy nuclear collision experiments. \n\n"}
