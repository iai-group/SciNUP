The theory of spontaneous symmetry breaking however, is\ninherently an equilibrium theory, which does not address the dynamics of\nquantum systems in the thermodynamic limit.

The symmetric capacity is the highest\nrate achievable subject to using the input letters of the channel with equal\nprobability. Channel polarization refers to the fact that it is possible to\nsynthesize, out of $N$ independent copies of a given B-DMC $W$, a second set of\n$N$ binary-input channels $\\{W_N^{(i)}:1\\le i\\le N\\}$ such that, as $N$ becomes\nlarge, the fraction of indices $i$ for which $I(W_N^{(i)})$ is near 1\napproaches $I(W)$ and the fraction for which $I(W_N^{(i)})$ is near 0\napproaches $1-I(W)$.

Tuning the gauge field\nstrength, the system undergoes stepwise transitions between different ground\nstates, which we describe by analytical trial wave functions, amongst them the\nPfaffian, the Laughlin, and a Laughlin quasiparticle many-body state. The\nadiabatic following of the center of mass movement by the lowest energy dressed\ninternal state, is lost by the mixing of the second internal state. This\nmixture can be controlled by the intensity of the laser field. The\nnon-adiabaticity is inherent to the considered setup, and is shown to play the\nrole of circular asymmetry. We study its influence on the properties of the\nground state of the system. Its main effect is to reduce the overlap of the\nnumerical solutions with the analytical trial expressions by occupying states\nwith higher angular momentum.

In particular, they shown that, for local\nstabilizer codes in D spatial dimensions, locality preserving gates are\nrestricted to a set of unitary gates known as the D-th level of the Clifford\nhierarchy. In this paper, we elaborate this idea and provide several extensions\nand applications of their characterization in various directions. First, we\npresent a new no-go theorem for self-correcting quantum memory. Namely, we\nprove that a three-dimensional stabilizer Hamiltonian with a\nlocality-preserving implementation of a non-Clifford gate cannot have a\nmacroscopic energy barrier. Second, we prove that the code distance of a\nD-dimensional local stabilizer code with non-trivial locality-preserving m-th\nlevel Clifford logical gate is upper bounded by $O(L^{D+1-m})$. For codes with\nnon-Clifford gates (m>2), this improves the previous best bound by Bravyi and\nTerhal.

This is established through the fact that an open system dynamics\ngenerates a Matrix Product state (MPS) which encodes the set of all possible\nquantum jump trajectories and permits the construction of generating functions\nin the spirit of thermodynamic partition functions. In the case of\ncontinuous-time Markovian evolution, such as that generated by a Lindblad\nmaster equation, the corresponding MPS is a so-called continuous MPS which\nencodes the set of continuous measurement records terminated at some fixed\ntotal observation time. Here we show that if one instead terminates\ntrajectories after a fixed total number of quantum jumps, e.g. emission events\ninto the environment, the associated MPS is discrete. This establishes an\ninteresting analogy: The continuous and discrete MPS correspond to different\nensembles of quantum trajectories, one characterised by total time the other by\ntotal number of quantum jumps. Hence they give rise to quantum versions of\ndifferent thermodynamic ensembles, akin to \"grand-canonical\" and \"isobaric\",\nbut for trajectories.

We here show\nthat this notion of coherence naturally arises in the context of quantum speed\nlimits.

Abstract: Two dimensional tensor networks such as projected entangled pairs states\n(PEPS) are generally hard to contract.

In this paper we introduce a new\napproach for approximating the expectation value of a local observable in\nground states of local Hamiltonians that are represented as PEPS\ntensor-networks. Instead of contracting the full tensor-network, we try to\nestimate the expectation value using only a local patch of the tensor-network\naround the observable. Surprisingly, we demonstrate that this is often easier\nto do when the system is frustrated. In such case, the spanning vectors of the\nlocal patch are subject to non-trivial constraints that can be utilized via a\nsemi-definite program to calculate rigorous lower- and upper-bounds on the\nexpectation value.

We start by\nintroducing a two-time quantum measurement scheme, in which the dynamical\nevolution between the measurements is described by a completely positive,\ntrace-preserving (CPTP) quantum map (forward process).

Recently, a hydrodynamical description of\nOTOCs has emerged from considering random local circuits, aspects of which are\nconjectured to be universal to ergodic many-body systems, even without\nrandomness. Here we extend this approach to systems with locally conserved\nquantities (e.g., energy).

The interplay between conservation laws and scrambling\nsheds light on the mechanism by which unitary quantum dynamics, which is\nreversible, gives rise to diffusive hydrodynamics, which is a dissipative\nprocess. We obtain our results in a random quantum circuit model that is\nconstrained to have a conservation law. We find that a generic spreading\noperator consists of two parts: (i) a conserved part which comprises the weight\nof the spreading operator on the local conserved densities, whose dynamics is\ndescribed by diffusive charge spreading. This conserved part also acts as a\nsource that steadily emits a flux of (ii) non-conserved operators. This\nemission leads to dissipation in the operator hydrodynamics, with the\ndissipative process being the conversion of operator weight from local\nconserved operators to nonconserved, at a rate set by the local diffusion\ncurrent. The emitted nonconserved parts then spread ballistically at a\nbutterfly speed, thus becoming highly nonlocal and hence essentially\nnon-observable, thereby acting as the \"reservoir\" that facilitates the\ndissipation. In addition, we find that the nonconserved component develops a\npower law tail behind its leading ballistic front due to the slow dynamics of\nthe conserved components. This implies that the out-of-time-order commutator\n(OTOC) between two initially separated operators grows sharply upon the arrival\nof the ballistic front but, in contrast to systems with no conservation laws,\nit develops a diffusive tail and approaches its asymptotic late-time value only\nas a power of time instead of exponentially.

For the algebra of local observables on\nmulti-qubit systems, the resulting local purity measure is equivalent to a\nrecently introduced global entanglement measure [Meyer and Wallach, J. Math.\nPhys. 43, 4273 (2002)]. In the condensed-matter setting, the notion of\nLie-algebraic purity is exploited to identify and characterize the quantum\nphase transitions present in two exactly solvable models: the\nLipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, and the spin-1/2 anisotropic XY model in a\ntransverse magnetic field. For the latter, we argue that a natural fermionic\nobservable-set arising after the Jordan-Wigner transformation, better\ncharacterizes the transition than alternative measures based on qubits. This\nillustrates the usefulness of going beyond the standard subsystem-based\nframework while providing a global disorder parameter for this model. Our\nresults show how generalized entanglement leads to useful tools for\ndistinguishing between the ordered and disordered phases in the case of broken\nsymmetry quantum phase transitions. Additional implications and possible\nextensions of concepts to other systems of interest in condensed matter physics\nare also discussed. \n\n"}

However, this bound only\napplies to codes which recover the message exactly. Naively, one might expect\nthat correcting errors to very high fidelity would only allow small violations\nof this bound. This intuition is incorrect: in this paper we describe quantum\nerror-correcting codes capable of correcting up to (n-1)/2 arbitrary errors\nwith fidelity exponentially close to 1, at the price of increasing the size of\nthe registers (i.e., the coding alphabet). This demonstrates a sharp\ndistinction between exact and approximate quantum error correction.

{"id": "quant-ph/9611025", "contents": "Title: Fault Tolerant Quantum Computation with Constant Error Abstract: Recently Shor showed how to perform fault tolerant quantum computation when\nthe error probability is logarithmically small. We improve this bound and\ndescribe fault tolerant quantum computation when the error probability is\nsmaller than some constant threshold. The cost is polylogarithmic in time and\nspace, and no measurements are used during the quantum computation. The result\nholds also for quantum circuits which operate on nearest neighbors only. To\nachieve this noise resistance, we use concatenated quantum error correcting\ncodes. The scheme presented is general, and works with all quantum codes that\nsatisfy some restrictions, namely that the code is ``proper''.\n  We present two explicit classes of proper quantum codes. The first example of\nproper quantum codes generalizes classical secret sharing with polynomials. The\nsecond uses a known class of quantum codes and converts it to a proper code.\nThis class is defined over a field with p elements, so the elementary quantum\nparticle is not a qubit but a ``qupit''. With our codes, the threshold is about\n10^(-6). Hopefully, this paper motivates a search for proper quantum codes with\nhigher thresholds, at which point quantum computation becomes practical. \n\n"}

This is done from the point\nof view of the cryptographer with a particular eye on applications in quantum\ncryptography. Each of the measures considered is rooted in an analogous\nclassical measure of distinguishability for probability distributions: namely,\nthe probability of an identification error, the Kolmogorov distance, the\nBhattacharyya coefficient, and the Shannon distinguishability (as defined\nthrough mutual information). These measures have a long history of use in\nstatistical pattern recognition and classical cryptography. We obtain several\ninequalities that relate the quantum distinguishability measures to each other,\none of which may be crucial for proving the security of quantum cryptographic\nkey distribution. In another vein, these measures and their connecting\ninequalities are used to define a single notion of cryptographic exponential\nindistinguishability for two families of quantum states. This is a tool that\nmay prove useful in the analysis of various quantum cryptographic protocols. \n\n"}

{"id": "quant-ph/9902063", "contents": "Title: State estimation for large ensembles Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the state of a large but finite number\n$N$ of identical quantum systems. In the limit of large $N$ the problem\nsimplifies. In particular the only relevant measure of the quality of the\nestimation is the mean quadratic error matrix. Here we present a bound on the\nmean quadratic error which is a new quantum version of the Cram\\'er-Rao\ninequality. This new bound expresses in a succinct way how in the quantum case\none can trade information about one parameter for information about another\nparameter. The bound holds for arbitrary measurements on pure states, but only\nfor separable measurements on mixed states--a striking example of non-locality\nwithout entanglement for mixed but not for pure states. Cram\\'er-Rao bounds are\ngenerally derived under the assumption that the estimator is unbiased. We also\nprove that under additional regularity conditions our bound also holds for\nbiased estimators. Finally we prove that when the unknown states belong to a 2\ndimensional Hilbert space our quantum Cram\\'er-Rao bound can always be attained\nand we provide an explicit measurement strategy that attains our bound. This\ntherefore provides a complete solution to the problem of estimating as\nefficiently as possible the unknown state of a large ensemble of qubits in the\nsame pure state. For qubits in the same mixed state, this also provides an\noptimal estimation strategy if one only considers separable measurements. \n\n"}
