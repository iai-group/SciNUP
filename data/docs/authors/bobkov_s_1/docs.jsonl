We study in the\npresent work fine properties of mixtures with respect to concentration of\nmeasure and Sobolev type functional inequalities. We provide sharp Laplace\nbounds for Lipschitz functions in the case of generic mixtures, involving a\ntransportation cost diameter of the mixed family.

We consider quantile regression penalized by the $\\ell_1$-norm of\ncoefficients ($\\ell_1$-QR). First, we show that $\\ell_1$-QR is consistent at\nthe rate $\\sqrt{s/n} \\sqrt{\\log p}$. The overall number of regressors $p$\naffects the rate only through the $\\log p$ factor, thus allowing nearly\nexponential growth in the number of zero-impact regressors. The rate result\nholds under relatively weak conditions, requiring that $s/n$ converges to zero\nat a super-logarithmic speed and that regularization parameter satisfies\ncertain theoretical constraints.

These RSPs are typically using the channel\nside information (CSI). Specifically, the relay terminal (RT) is chosen among\nall available RTs by a central entity (CE) which receives all RTs' CSI via\nfeedback channels. However, in the millimeter wave radio frequencies, the rate\nof the CSI variation is much higher than that of the CSI variation in 6 GHz\nfrequencies under the same mobility conditions, which evidently results in a\nserious problem causing that the CSI at the CE is inaccurate for the RSP since\nthe feedback channels have a backhaul / transmission delay. However and\nfortunately, the shadowing side information (SSI) varies very slowly in\ncomparison to the rate of the CSI variation.

In particular, we address the challenge of improving the standard\ntwo-way selective decode-and-forward protocol (TW-SDF) in terms of\nblock-error-rate (BLER) with minor additional complexity and energy\nconsumption. By following the principle of soft relaying, our solution is the\ntwo-way one-bit soft forwarding (TW-1bSF) protocol in which the relay forwards\nthe one-bit quantization of a posterior information metric about the\ntransmitted bits, associated with an appropriately designed reliability\nparameter.\n  In WSN-related standards (such as IEEE802.15.6 and Bluetooth), block codes\nare adopted instead of convolutional and other sophisticated codes, due to\ntheir efficient decoder hardware implementation.

In this paper we provide a detailed\nasymptotic analysis of large average submatrices of an $n \\times n$ Gaussian\nrandom matrix. The first part of the paper addresses global maxima. For fixed\n$k$ we identify the average and the joint distribution of the $k \\times k$\nsubmatrix having largest average value. As a dual result, we establish that the\nsize of the largest square sub-matrix with average bigger than a fixed positive\nconstant is, with high probability, equal to one of two consecutive integers\nthat depend on the threshold and the matrix dimension $n$. The second part of\nthe paper addresses local maxima. Specifically we consider submatrices with\ndominant row and column sums that arise as the local optima of iterative search\nprocedures for large average submatrices. For fixed $k$, we identify the\nlimiting average value and joint distribution of a $k \\times k$ submatrix\nconditioned to be a local maxima. In order to understand the density of such\nlocal optima and explain the quick convergence of such iterative procedures, we\nanalyze the number $L_n(k)$ of local maxima, beginning with exact asymptotic\nexpressions for the mean and fluctuation behavior of $L_n(k)$. For fixed $k$,\nthe mean of $L_{n}(k)$ is $\\Theta(n^{k}/(\\log{n})^{(k-1)/2})$ while the\nstandard deviation is $\\Theta(n^{2k^2/(k+1)}/(\\log{n})^{k^2/(k+1)})$.

In gene expression models, the concept of\nbursting is a production of several molecules simultaneously and is generally\nrepresented as a compound Poisson process of random size. In a general\ntwo-dimensional birth and death discrete model, we prove that under specific\nassumptions and scaling (that are characteristics of the mRNA-protein system)\nan adiabatic reduction leads to a one-dimensional discrete-state space model\nwith bursting production. The burst term appears through the reduction of the\nfirst variable. In a two-dimensional continuous model, we also prove that an\nadiabatic reduction can be performed in a stochastic slow/fast system. In this\ngene expression model, the production of mRNA (the fast variable) is assumed to\nbe bursty and the production of protein (the slow variable) is linear as a\nfunction of mRNA. When the dynamics of mRNA is assumed to be faster than the\nprotein dynamics (due to a mRNA degradation rate larger than for the protein)\nwe prove that, with the appropriate scaling, the bursting phenomena can be\ntransmitted to the slow variable. We show that the reduced equation is either a\nstochastic differential equation with a jump Markov process or a deterministic\nordinary differential equation depending on the scaling that is appropriate.\n  These results are significant because adiabatic reduction techniques seem to\nhave not been applied to a stochastic differential system containing a jump\nMarkov process.

Via the Cartan-Dieudonne\ntheorem, the reflective symmetries of the Platonic solids generate rotations.\nIn a Clifford algebra framework, the space of spinors generating such\nthree-dimensional rotations has a natural four-dimensional Euclidean structure.\nThe spinors arising from the Platonic Solids can thus in turn be interpreted as\nvertices in four-dimensional space, giving a simple construction of the 4D\npolytopes 16-cell, 24-cell, the F_4 root system and the 600-cell. In\nparticular, these polytopes have `mysterious' symmetries, that are almost\ntrivial when seen from the three-dimensional spinorial point of view. In fact,\nall these induced polytopes are also known to be root systems and thus generate\nrank-4 Coxeter groups, which can be shown to be a general property of the\nspinor construction.

We show\nthat there is an intimate connection between the connective constant of a graph\nand the phenomenon of strong spatial mixing (decay of correlations) for the\nhard core model; specifically, we prove that the hard core model with vertex\nactivity lambda < lambda_c(Delta + 1) exhibits strong spatial mixing on any\ngraph of connective constant Delta, irrespective of its maximum degree, and\nhence derive an FPTAS for the partition function of the hard core model on such\ngraphs.

It is common in both signal\nprocessing and statistics to assume the linear response model y_i = <a_i, x> +\ne_i, where e_i is a noise term. However, in practice the precise relationship\nbetween the signal x and the observations y_i may not follow the linear model,\nand in some cases it may not even be known. To address this challenge, in this\npaper we propose a general model where it is only assumed that each observation\ny_i may depend on a_i only through <a_i, x>. We do not assume that the\ndependence is known. This is a form of the semiparametric single index model,\nand it includes the linear model as well as many forms of the generalized\nlinear model as special cases. We further assume that the signal x has some\nstructure, and we formulate this as a general assumption that x belongs to some\nknown (but arbitrary) feasible set K. We carefully detail the benefit of using\nthe signal structure to improve estimation. The theory is based on the mean\nwidth of K, a geometric parameter which can be used to understand its effective\ndimension in estimation problems. We determine a simple, efficient two-step\nprocedure for estimating the signal based on this model -- a linear estimation\nfollowed by metric projection onto K. We give general conditions under which\nthe estimator is minimax optimal up to a constant. This leads to the intriguing\nconclusion that in the high noise regime, an unknown non-linearity in the\nobservations does not significantly reduce one's ability to determine the\nsignal, even when the non-linearity may be non-invertible.

This paper rigorously\nanalyzes the local EnKF (LEnKF) for linear systems, and shows that the filter\nerror can be dominated by the ensemble covariance, as long as 1) the sample\nsize exceeds the logarithmic of state dimension and a constant that depends\nonly on the local radius; 2) the forecast covariance matrix admits a stable\nlocalized structure.

Ideas from compressed sensing may be employed to exploit\nthis sparsity in order to reduce computational costs. A class of greedy\ncompressed sensing algorithms use least squares minimization to approximate PC\ncoefficients. This least squares problem lends itself to the theory of optimal\ndesign of experiments (ODE). Our work focuses on selecting an experimental\ndesign that improves the accuracy of sparse PC approximations for a fixed\ncomputational budget. We propose DSP, a novel sequential design, greedy\nalgorithm for sparse PC approximation. The algorithm sequentially augments an\nexperimental design according to a set of the basis polynomials deemed\nimportant by the magnitude of their coefficients, at each iteration. Our\nalgorithm incorporates topics from ODE to estimate the PC coefficients. A\nvariety of numerical simulations are performed on three physical models and\nmanufactured sparse PC expansions to provide a comparative study between our\nproposed algorithm and other non-adaptive methods.

First, when the $n$-player\nequilibria are open-loop, compactness arguments permit a characterization of\nall limit points of $n$-player equilibria as weak MFG equilibria, which contain\nadditional randomness compared to the standard (strong) equilibrium concept.

Every limit\npoint of $n$-player equilibria is shown to be the same kind of weak MFG\nequilibrium as in the open-loop case.

Let the vertices at\ndistance $k$ from $X$ be called layer $k$. At layer $0$, $X$ is given a random\nbit. At layer $k\\geq 1$, each vertex receives $d$ bits from its parents in\nlayer $k-1$, which are transmitted along independent binary symmetric channel\nedges, and combines them using a $d$-ary Boolean processing function. The goal\nis to reconstruct $X$ with probability of error bounded away from $1/2$ using\nthe values of all vertices at an arbitrarily deep layer. This question is\nclosely related to models of reliable computation and storage, and information\nflow in biological networks.\n  In this paper, we analyze randomly constructed DAGs, for which we show that\nbroadcasting is only possible if the noise level is below a certain degree and\nfunction dependent critical threshold. For $d\\geq 3$, and random DAGs with\nlayer sizes $\\Omega(\\log k)$ and majority processing functions, we identify the\ncritical threshold.

{"id": "math/0005136", "contents": "Title: On the critical exponents of random k-SAT Abstract: There has been much recent interest in the satisfiability of random Boolean\nformulas. A random k-SAT formula is the conjunction of m random clauses, each\nof which is the disjunction of k literals (a variable or its negation). It is\nknown that when the number of variables n is large, there is a sharp transition\nfrom satisfiability to unsatisfiability; in the case of 2-SAT this happens when\nm/n --> 1, for 3-SAT the critical ratio is thought to be m/n ~ 4.2. The\nsharpness of this transition is characterized by a critical exponent, sometimes\ncalled \\nu=\\nu_k (the smaller the value of \\nu the sharper the transition).\nExperiments have suggested that \\nu_3 = 1.5+-0.1, \\nu_4 = 1.25+-0.05,\n\\nu_5=1.1+-0.05, \\nu_6 = 1.05+-0.05, and heuristics have suggested that \\nu_k\n--> 1 as k --> infinity.

As an independent way to check the reliability of the\nclassification, we propose a statistical approach to test if two sets of\nprotein domain sequences coming from two families of the Pfam database are\nsignificantly different. We model protein sequences as realizations of Variable\nLength Markov Chains (VLMC) and we use the context trees as a signature of each\nprotein family. Our approach is based on a Kolmogorov--Smirnov-type\ngoodness-of-fit test proposed by Balding et al. [Limit theorems for sequences\nof random trees (2008), DOI: 10.1007/s11749-008-0092-z]. The test statistic is\na supremum over the space of trees of a function of the two samples; its\ncomputation grows, in principle, exponentially fast with the maximal number of\nnodes of the potential trees. We show how to transform this problem into a\nmax-flow over a related graph which can be solved using a Ford--Fulkerson\nalgorithm in polynomial time on that number. We apply the test to 10 randomly\nchosen protein domain families from the seed of Pfam-A database (high quality,\nmanually curated families). The test shows that the distributions of context\ntrees coming from different families are significantly different. We emphasize\nthat this is a novel mathematical approach to validate the automatic clustering\nof sequences in any context. We also study the performance of the test via\nsimulations on Galton--Watson related processes. \n\n"}
