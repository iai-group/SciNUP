Of particular importance is the fate of the\ninitial value problem. Under what circumstances do infinite order differential\nequations possess a well-defined initial value problem and how many initial\ndata are required? In this paper we study the initial value problem for\ninfinite order differential equations in the mathematical framework of the\nformal operator calculus, with analytic initial data. This formalism allows us\nto handle simultaneously a wide array of different nonlocal equations within a\nsingle framework and also admits a transparent physical interpretation.

Abstract: At present, there are two possible, and equally plausible, explanations for\nthe physics of quantum measurement. The first explanation, known as the\nmany-worlds interpretation, does not require any modification of quantum\nmechanics, and asserts that at the time of measurement the Universe splits into\nmany branches, one branch for every possible alternative. The various branches\ndo not interfere with each other because of decoherence, thus providing a\npicture broadly consistent with the observed Universe. The second explanation,\nwhich requires quantum mechanics to be modified from its presently known form,\nis that at the time of measurement the wave-function collapses into one of the\npossible alternatives. The two explanations are mutually exclusive, and up\nuntil now, no theoretical reasoning has been put forward to choose one\nexplanation over the other. In this article, we provide an argument which\nimplies that the collapse interpretation is favored over the many-worlds\ninterpretation.

We show for SGRs and\nAXPs that, the occurrence of the glitch and the gain of rotational energy, is\ndue to the release of gravitational energy associated to the contraction and\ndecrease of the moment of inertia of the WDs. The steady emission and the\noutburst following the glitch are explained by the loss of rotational energy of\nthe Wds, in view of the much larger moment of inertia of the WDs, as compared\nto the one of NSs and/or quark stars. There is no need here to invoke the\nunorthodox concept of magnetic energy release due to decay of overcritical\nmagnetic fields, as assumed in the magnetar model.

If this deconfinement phase\ntransition is of the first order then it will be triggered by the nucleation of\na critical size drop of the stable quark phase in the metastable hadronic\nphase. Within these circumstances it has been shown that cold pure hadronic\ncompact stars above a threshold value of their gravitational mass are\nmetastable with respect to the \"decay\" to quark stars (compact stars made at\nleast in part of quark matter). This stellar conversion process liberates a\nhuge amount of energy, and it could be the energy source of some of the long\nGRBs. The main goal of the present work is to establish whether a newborn\nhadronic star (proto-hadronic star) could survive the early stages of its\nevolution without \"decaying\" to a quark star. To this aim, we study the\nnucleation process of quark matter in hot beta-stable hadronic matter, with and\nwithout trapped neutrinos. We calculate and compare the nucleation rate and the\nnucleation time due to thermal and quantum nucleation mechanisms. We compute\nthe crossover temperature above which thermal nucleation dominates the finite\ntemperature quantum nucleation mechanism.

In\nthe bosonic models we show the existence of an exotic first/second order\ntransition from a phase with a well defined background geometry (the fuzzy\nsphere) to a phase with commuting matrices with no geometry in the sense of\nConnes. At the transition point the sphere expands abruptly to infinite size\nthen it evaporates as we increase the temperature (the gauge coupling\nconstant). The transition looks first order due to the discontinuity in the\naction whereas it looks second order due to the divergent peak in the specific\nheat. The fuzzy sphere is stable for the supersymmetric models in the sense\nthat the bosonic phase transition is turned into a very slow crossover\ntransition. The transition point is found to scale to zero with N. We\nconjecture that the transition from the background sphere to the phase of\ncommuting matrices is associated with spontaneous supersymmetry breaking.

In order to investigate\nthe effect of very strong magnetic field, we focus only on systems in which a\nmaximum of either one, two or three Landau level(s) is/are occupied. This is\nimportant since, if a very large number of Landau levels are filled, it implies\na very low magnetic field strength which yields back Chandrasekhar's celebrated\nnon-magnetic results. The maximum number of occupied Landau levels is fixed by\nthe correct choice of two parameters, namely the magnetic field strength and\nthe maximum Fermi energy of the system. We study the equations of state of\nthese one-level, two-level and three-level systems and compare them by taking\nthree different maximum Fermi energies.

The formation\nof a deformed, oscillating, differentially rotating very massive NS is the\ntypical outcome of the coalescence of two stars with 1.35 $M_{\\odot}$ for most\ncandidate EoSs. The oscillations of this object imprint a pronounced peak in\nthe gravitational-wave (GW) spectra, which is used to characterize the emission\nfor a given model. The peak frequency of this postmerger GW signal correlates\nvery well with the radii of nonrotating NSs, and thus allows to constrain the\nhigh-density EoS by a GW detection.

We critically review the radio pulsar mass\nmeasurements. For the first time, we are able to analyze a sizable population\nof NSs with a flexible modeling approach that can effectively accommodate a\nskewed underlying distribution and asymmetric measurement errors. We find that\nNSs that have evolved through different evolutionary paths reflect distinctive\nsignatures through dissimilar distribution peak and mass cutoff values. NSs in\ndouble neutron star and neutron star-white dwarf systems show consistent\nrespective peaks at 1.33 Msun and 1.55 Msun suggesting significant mass\naccretion (delta m~0.22 Msun) has occurred during the spin-up phase. The width\nof the mass distribution implied by double NS systems is indicative of a tight\ninitial mass function while the inferred mass range is significantly wider for\nNSs that have gone through recycling. We find a mass cutoff at ~2.1 Msun for\nNSs with white dwarf companions which establishes a firm lower bound for the\nmaximum NS mass. This rules out the majority of strange quark and soft equation\nof state models as viable configurations for NS matter. The lack of truncation\nclose to the maximum mass cutoff along with the skewed nature of the inferred\nmass distribution both enforce the suggestion that the 2.1 Msun limit is set by\nevolutionary constraints rather than nuclear physics or general relativity, and\nthe existence of rare super-massive NSs is possible. \n\n"}

We employ\naxisymmetric, time-dependent hydrodynamic simulations of remnant accretion\ndisks orbiting a HMNS of variable lifetime, and characterize the effect of this\ndelay to BH formation on the disk wind ejecta.

The method relies on a small number of\ndetections of the peak frequency in the postmerger phase for binaries of\ndifferent (relatively low) masses, in the most likely range of expected\ndetections. From such observations, one can construct the derivative of the\npeak frequency versus the binary mass, in this mass range. Through a detailed\nstudy of binary neutron star mergers for a large sample of equations of state,\nwe show that one can extrapolate the above information to the highest possible\nmass (the threshold mass for black hole formation in a binary neutron star\nmerger). In turn, this allows for an empirical determination of the maximum\nmass of cold, nonrotating neutron stars to within 0.1 M_sun, while the\ncorresponding radius is determined to within a few percent. Combining this with\nthe determination of the radius of cold, nonrotating neutron stars of 1.6 M_sun\n(to within a few percent, as was demonstrated in Bauswein et al., PRD, 86,\n063001, 2012), allows for a clear distinction of a particular candidate\nequation of state among a large set of other candidates.

In particular, we focus on effects of the following\nparameters characterizing the EOS of neutron-rich nucleonic matter: (1) the\nincompressibility $K_0$ of symmetric nuclear matter, (2) the slope $L$ of\nsymmetry energy at saturation density and (3) the high-density behavior of\nsymmetry energy.

The gravity of\nthe spinning black hole is included via a pseudo-Newtonian potential. We find\nthat a disk around a spinning black hole ejects more mass, up to a factor of\nseveral, relative to the non-spinning case.

Confronted against the cosmic shear data, we\nreject the $f(R)$ $\\{ |f_{R_0}|=10^{-4}, n=1\\}$ model with more than 99.9%\nconfidence interval (CI) when assuming a $\\Lambda$CDM dark matter only model.\nIn the presence of baryonic feedback processes and massive neutrinos with total\nmass up to 0.2eV, the model is disfavoured with at least 94% CI in all\ndifferent combinations studied.

In particular, no non-singular bounce is\npossible.

In particular, we analyze what portion of\nthe bulk can be reconstructed as spacetime in the holographic theory. The\nanalysis indicates that when a spacetime contains a quasi-static black hole\ninside a holographic screen, the theory provides a description of physics as\nviewed from the exterior (though the interior information is not absent). In\nthe second half, we study how and when a semiclassical description emerges in\nthe holographic theory.

Abstract: We investigate an entangled system, which is analogous to a composite system\nof a black hole and Hawking radiation. If Hawking radiation is well\napproximated by an outgoing particle generated from pair creation around the\nblack hole, such a pair creation increases the total number of states. There\nshould be a unitary mechanism to reduce the number of states inside the horizon\nfor black hole evaporation. Because the infalling antiparticle has negative\nenergy, as long as the infalling antiparticle finds its partner such that the\ntwo particles form a separable state, one can trace out such a zero energy\nsystem by maintaining unitarity. In this paper, based on some toy model\ncalculations, we show that such a unitary tracing-out process is only possible\nbefore the Page time while it is impossible after the Page time. Hence, after\nthe Page time, if we assume that the process is unitary and the Hawking pair\nforms a separable state, the internal number of states will monotonically\nincrease, which is supported by the Almheiri-Marolf-Polchinski-Sully (AMPS)\nargument. In addition, the Hawking particles cannot generate randomness of the\nentire system; hence, the entanglement entropy cannot reach its maximum. Based\non these results, we modify the correct form of the Page curve for the remnant\npicture. The most important conclusion is this: if we assume unitarity,\nsemi-classical quantum field theory, and general relativity, then the black\nhole should violate the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy bound around the Page time\nat the latest; hence, the infinite production arguments for remnants might be\napplied for semi-classical black holes, which seems very problematic. \n\n"}

In order to make the best use of gravitational wave data from mergers,\nit is important to include the correlations relating the Lambdas and the masses\nas well as lower limits to the Lambdas as a function of mass. Focusing on the\ncase without strong phase transitions, and for mergers where the chirp mass\nM_chirp<1.4M_sun, which is the case for all observed double neutron star\nsystems where a total mass has been accurately measured, we show that the\ndimensionless Lambdas satisfy Lambda_1/Lambda_2= q^6, where q=M_2/M_1 is the\nbinary mass ratio; $M$ is mass of each star, respectively. Moreover, they are\nbounded by q^{n_-}>Lambda_1/Lambda_2> q^{n_{0+}+qn_{1+}}, where\nn_-<n_{0+}+qn_{1+}; the parameters depend only on M_chirp, which is accurately\ndetermined from the gravitational-wave signal. We also provide analytic\nexpressions for the wider bounds that exist in the case of a strong phase\ntransition. We argue that bounded ranges for Lambda_1/Lambda_2, tuned to\nM_chirp, together with lower bounds to Lambda(M), will be more useful in\ngravitational waveform modeling than other suggested approaches. \n\n"}

One set, involving the antisymmetric part of the\nRicci tensor $R_{\\stackrel{\\mu\\nu}{\\vee}}$, consists of the field equation for\na massive vector field. The other set consists of the Einstein field equations\nwith an energy momentum tensor for the vector field plus additional\ncorrections. In a vacuum with $R_{\\stackrel{\\mu\\nu}{\\vee}}=0$ the field\nequations are shown to be the usual Einstein vacuum equations. This extends the\nuniversality of the vacuum Einstein equations, discussed by Ferraris et al.\n\\cite{Fe1,Fe2}, to the Born-Infeld-Einstein action. In the simplest version of\nthe theory there is a single coupling constant and by requiring that the\nEinstein field equations hold to a good approximation in neutron stars it is\nshown that mass of the vector field exceeds the lower bound on the mass of the\nphoton. Thus, in this case the vector field cannot represent the\nelectromagnetic field and would describe a new geometrical field. In a more\ngeneral version in which the symmetric and antisymmetric parts of the Ricci\ntensor have different coupling constants it is possible to satisfy all of the\nobservational constraints if the antisymmetric coupling is much larger than the\nsymmetric coupling. In this case the antisymmetric part of the Ricci tensor can\ndescribe the electromagnetic field, although gauge invariance will be broken. \n\n"}
