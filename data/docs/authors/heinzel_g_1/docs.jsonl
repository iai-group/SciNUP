We consider\ntwo limiting mass accretion scenarios, no accretion and significant accretion.\nWe find that the radiation power strongly depends on not only the asymptotic\ncondition but also the mass accretion scenario. For the no accretion case, we\nconsider the Einstein-Straus solution, where a black hole of constant mass\nresides in the dust Friedmann universe. We find negative cosmological\ncorrection besides the expected redshift factor. This is given in terms of the\ncubic root of ratio in size of the black hole to the cosmological horizon, so\nthat it is currently of order $10^{-5} (M/10^{6}M_{\\odot})^{1/3} (t/14\n{Gyr})^{-1/3}$ but could have been significant at the formation epoch of\nprimordial black holes. Due to the cosmological effects, this black hole has\nnot settled down to an equilibrium state. This cosmological correction may be\ninterpreted in an analogy with the radiation from a moving mirror in a flat\nspacetime. For the significant accretion case, we consider the Sultana-Dyer\nsolution, where a black hole tends to increase its mass in proportion to the\ncosmological scale factor. In this model, we find that the radiation power is\napparently the same as the Hawking radiation from the Schwarzschild black hole\nof which mass is that of the growing mass at each moment. Hence, the energy\nloss rate decreases and tends to vanish as time proceeds. Consequently, the\nenergy loss due to evaporation is insignificant compared to huge mass accretion\nonto the black hole. Based on this model, we propose a definition of\nquasi-equilibrium temperature for general conformal stationary black holes. \n\n"}

It is based on binning the normalized\ndifferences between the SnIa distance moduli and the corresponding best fit\nvalues in the context of a specific cosmological model (eg LCDM). We then focus\non the highest redshift bin and extend its size towards lower redshifts until\nthe Binned Normalized Difference (BND) changes sign (crosses 0) at a redshift\nz_c (bin size N_c). The bin size N_c of this crossing (the statistical\nvariable) is then compared with the corresponding crossing bin size N_{mc} for\nMonte Carlo data realizations based on the best fit model. We find that the\ncrossing bin size N_c obtained from the Union08 and Gold06 data with respect to\nthe best fit LCDM model is anomalously large compared to N_{mc} of the\ncorresponding Monte Carlo datasets obtained from the best fit LCDM in each\ncase. In particular, only 2.2% of the Monte Carlo LCDM datasets are consistent\nwith the Gold06 value of N_c while the corresponding probability for the\nUnion08 value of N_c is 5.3%. Thus, according to this statistic, the\nprobability that the high redshift brightness bias of the Union08 and Gold06\ndatasets is realized in the context of a (w_0,w_1)=(-1,0) model (LCDM\ncosmology) is less than 6%. The corresponding realization probability in the\ncontext of a (w_0,w_1)=(-1.4,2) model is more than 30% for both the Union08 and\nthe Gold06 datasets. \n\n"}

This is one of the first\nconcrete results of the self-force program, and provides an exact point of\ncomparison with approximate post-Newtonian (PN) computations of the ISCO.

The best agreement with the exact result\nis found from effective-one-body (EOB) calculations that are fit to numerical\nrelativity simulations. However, if one considers uncalibrated methods based\nonly on the currently known 3PN-order conservative dynamics, the best agreement\nis found from the gauge-invariant ISCO condition of Blanchet and Iyer (2003).\nThis method reproduces the exact test-particle limit without any resummation.

The feeble nature of these signals requires a strong\nsuppression of backgrounds below a few MeV. Very low intrinsic radiogenic\ncontamination of all detector components needs to be accompanied by the\nefficient identification of muons and of muon-induced backgrounds. Muons\nproduce unstable nuclei by spallation processes along their trajectory through\nthe detector whose decays can mimic the expected signals; for isotopes with\nhalf-lives longer than a few seconds, the dead time induced by a muon-related\nveto becomes unacceptably long, unless its application can be restricted to a\nsub-volume along the muon track. Consequently, not only the identification of\nmuons with very high efficiency but also a precise reconstruction of their\ntracks is of primary importance for the physics program of the experiment. The\nBorexino inner detector is surrounded by an outer water-Cherenkov detector that\nplays a fundamental role in accomplishing this task. The detector design\nprinciples and their implementation are described. The strategies adopted to\nidentify muons are reviewed and their efficiency is evaluated.

We\nconfirm this using an independent analysis and propose an expansion to the\nself-calibration technique for the bispectrum in order to calculate the\ndominant IA gravitational shear-gravitational shear-intrinsic ellipticity\ncorrelation (GGI) contamination. We first establish an estimator to extract the\ngalaxy density-density-intrinsic ellipticity (ggI) correlation from the galaxy\nellipticity-density-density measurement for a photo-z galaxy sample.

On short timescales the orbit of the small\nobject is approximately geodesic.

That\ncan be achieved, for instance, by studying the properties of the\nelectromagnetic radiation emitted by the gas in the accretion disk. The\nhigh-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations observed in the X-ray flux of some\nstellar-mass black hole candidates might do the job. As the frequencies of\nthese oscillations depend only very weakly on the observed X-ray flux, it is\nthought they are mainly determined by the metric of the space-time. In this\npaper, I consider the resonance models proposed by Abramowicz and Kluzniak and\nI extend previous results to the case of non-Kerr space-times. The emerging\npicture is more complicated than the one around a Kerr black hole and there is\na larger number of possible combinations between different modes.

After merger, our results can be\ninterpreted as a coherent excitation of quasinormal modes of different angular\norders, a superposition which naturally \"precesses\" and modulates the\nline-of-sight amplitude.

While red timing\nnoise was only included in Dataset 3, I found that it was necessary to include\neffective red noise in all the analyses to account for some of the spurious\neffects introduced by the TEMPO2 timing fit. This added an additional amplitude\nand slope parameter for each pulsar, so my overall model for the 36 pulsars\nresiduals has 110 parameters. As an alternative to using an effective red noise\nmodel, I also tried to simultaneously re-fit the timing model model while\nlooking for the gravitational wave signal, but for reasons that are not yet\nclear, this approach was not very successful. I comment briefly on ways in\nwhich the algorithms could be improved.

To this end, we perform 3D general-relativistic\nsimulations with a 3-species neutrino leakage scheme. The leakage scheme\ncaptures the essential aspects of neutrino cooling, heating, and lepton number\nexchange as predicted by radiation-hydrodynamics simulations. The 27-solar-mass\nprogenitor was studied in 2D by B. Mueller et al. (ApJ 761:72, 2012), who\nobserved strong growth of the SASI while neutrino-driven convection was\nsuppressed. In our 3D simulations, neutrino-driven convection grows from\nnumerical perturbations imposed by our Cartesian grid. It becomes the dominant\ninstability and leads to large-scale non-oscillatory deformations of the shock\nfront. These will result in strongly aspherical explosions without the need for\nlarge-scale SASI shock oscillations. Low-l-mode SASI oscillations are present\nin our models, but saturate at small amplitudes that decrease with increasing\nneutrino heating and vigor of convection. Our results, in agreement with\nsimpler 3D Newtonian simulations, suggest that once neutrino-driven convection\nis started, it is likely to become the dominant instability in 3D.

We also provide a general recipe to construct non-BPS\nextremal solutions for an arbitrary prepotential, as long as an axion-free\ncondition holds.

Second, spin parameters of a number of\naccreting stellar-mass black holes have been measured.

Multi-messenger\nastronomy provides a unique opportunity to put limits on the difference (either\npositive or negative) between the propagation speed of electromagnetic and\ngravitational waves from these sources.

The reasoning for this study is the need for consistency of the\nvarious codimension defects and the existence of a meaningful equation of\nmotion at the probe limit, things that seem to lack from the standard approach.\nThese matching conditions arise by varying the brane-bulk action with respect\nto the brane embedding fields (and not with respect to the bulk metric at the\nbrane position) in a way that takes into account the gravitational\nback-reaction of the brane to the bulk. They always possess a Nambu-Goto probe\nlimit and any codimension defect is seemingly consistent for any second order\nbulk gravity theory. Here, we consider in detail the case of a codimension-1\nbrane in five-dimensional Einstein gravity, derive the generic alternative\njunction conditions and find the Z_{2}-symmetric braneworld cosmology, as well\nas its bulk extension. Compared to the standard braneworld cosmology, the new\none has an extra integration constant which accounts for the today matter and\ndark energy contents, therefore, there is more freedom for accommodating the\nobserved cosmic features. One branch of the solution possesses the asymptotic\nlinearized LFRW regime.

For two decades,\nseveral modeling efforts based on the solution of the null geodesic equations\nhave been proposed but they are mainly valid only for the first order\nPost-Newtonian approximation.

This includes exploring the advantages of constructing a\nthird-generation gravitational-wave detector underground. A major noise source\nfor these detectors would be Newtonian noise, which is induced by fluctuations\nin the local gravitational field. The hope is that a combination of a low-noise\nseismic environment and coherent noise subtraction using seismometers in the\nvicinity of the detector could suppress the Newtonian noise to below the\nprojected noise floor for future gravitational-wave detectors. In this paper,\nwe use Wiener filtering techniques to subtract coherent noise in a seismic\narray in the frequency band 0.05 -- 1\\,Hz. This achieves more than an order of\nmagnitude noise cancellation over a majority of this band. We show how this\nsubtraction would benefit proposed future low-frequency gravitational wave\ndetectors.

Working at second order in the dimensionless angular\nmomentum, we compute the mass M, radius R, scalar charge q, moment of inertia I\nand spin-induced quadrupole moment Q, as well as the tidal and rotational Love\nnumbers. Our formalism applies to generic scalar-tensor theories, but we focus\nin particular on theories that allow for spontaneous scalarization. It was\nrecently discovered that the moment of inertia, quadrupole moment and Love\nnumbers are connected by approximately universal (i.e., equation-of-state\nindependent) \"I-Love-Q\" relations. We find that similar relations hold also for\nspontaneously scalarized stars. More interestingly, the I-Love-Q relations in\nscalar-tensor theories coincide with the general relativistic ones within less\nthan a few percent, even for spontaneously scalarized stars with the largest\ncouplings allowed by current binary-pulsar constraints. This implies that\nastrophysical measurements of these parameters cannot be used to discriminate\nbetween general relativity and scalar-tensor theories, even if spontaneous\nscalarization occurs in nature. Because of the well known equivalence between\nf(R) theories and scalar-tensor theories, the theoretical framework developed\nin this paper can be used to construct rotating compact stellar models in f(R)\ngravity.

Hence, a co-located detector pair is\nmore sensitive to a gravitational-wave background than a non-co-located\ndetector pair. However, co-located detectors are also expected to suffer from\ncorrelated noise from instrumental and environmental effects that could\ncontaminate the measurement of the background.

RX J0852.0-4622 or Vela\nJr.) reveal evidence of a radial displacement of 2.40 +/- 0.56 arcsec between\n2003 and 2008. The corresponding expansion rate (0.42 +/- 0.10 arcsec/yr or\n13.6 +/- 4.2%/kyr) is about half the rate reported for an analysis of\nXMM-Newton data from a similar, but not identical, portion of the rim over a\nsimilar, but not identical, time interval (0.84 +/- 0.23 arcsec/yr, Katsuda et\nal. 2008a). If the Chandra rate is representative of the remnant as a whole,\nthen the results of a hydrodynamic analysis suggest that G266.2-1.2 is between\n2.4 and 5.1 kyr old if it is expanding into a uniform ambient medium (whether\nor not it was produced by a Type Ia or Type II event).

Studies of\npulsars demonstrate that their electromagnetic (EM) emissions suffer from\n\\emph{timing noise}, small deviations in the phase from Taylor expansion\nmodels. How the mechanism producing EM emission is related to any continuous\ngravitational-wave (CW) emission is unknown; if they either interact or are\nlocked in phase then the CW will also experience timing noise. Any disparity\nbetween the signal and the search template used in matched filtering methods\nwill result in a loss of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), referred to as\n`mismatch'. In this work we assume the CW suffers a similar level of timing\nnoise to its EM counterpart. We inject and recover fake CW signals, which\ninclude timing noise generated from observational data on the Crab pulsar.\nMeasuring the mismatch over durations of order $\\sim 10$ months, the effect is\nfor the most part found to be small. This suggests recent so-called\n`narrow-band' searches which placed upper limits on the signals from the Crab\nand Vela pulsars will not be significantly affected.

Such\napproximately universal relations are useful to break degeneracies in data\nanalysis for future radio, X-ray and gravitational wave observations. Although\nthe pressure inside compact stars is most likely nearly isotropic, certain\nscenarios have been put forth that suggest otherwise, for example due to phase\ntransitions. We here investigate whether pressure anisotropy affects the\napproximate universal relations and whether it prevents their use in future\nobservations. We achieve this by numerically constructing slowly-rotating and\ntidally-deformed, anisotropic, compact stars in General Relativity to third\norder in spin. We find that anisotropy affects the universal relations only\nweakly; the relations become less universal by a factor of 1.5-3 relative to\nthe isotropic case, but remain approximately universal to 10%. We succeed in\nexplaining this increase in variability as an increase in the eccentricity\nvariation of isodensity contours, which provides further support for the\nemergent approximate symmetry explanation of universality. Anisotropy does not\naffect the universal relations to a sufficient level to prevent their use in\ngravitational wave astrophysics or in experimental relativity.

Lensing phenomena and circular orbits are investigated for\nplasma density distributions $N \\propto 1/r^h$ with $h \\geq 0$ in the\nSchwarzschild space-time. For rays passing by the mass near the plasma\nfrequency refractive effects can dominate, effectively turning the\ngravitational lens into a mirror.

In any single pulsar, a stochastic gravitational wave signal appears as\nan additional source of timing noise that can be absorbed by the noise model,\nand so it is only by considering the coherent response across a network of\npulsars that the signal can be distinguished from other sources of noise. In\nthe limit where there are many gravitational wave sources in the sky, or many\npulsars in the array, the signals produce a unique tensor correlation pattern\nthat depends only on the angular separation between each pulsar pair. It is\nthis distinct fingerprint that is used to search for gravitational waves using\npulsar timing arrays.

The existence of black\nhole horizons which cover up the interior, including the singularity of the\nblack hole from outside observers, builds an information curtain, further\nhindering physicists from understanding the nature of the singularity and the\ninterior structure of black holes.

To\nestablish it, we start by showing that a test, complex Proca field can form\nbound states, with real frequency, around Kerr BHs: stationary Proca clouds.\nThese states exist at the threshold of superradiance. It was conjectured in\narXiv:1403.2757, that the existence of such clouds at the linear level implies\nthe existence of a new family of BH solutions at the non-linear level. We\nconfirm this expectation and explicitly construct examples of such Kerr black\nholes with Proca hair (KBHsPH). For a single complex Proca field, these BHs\nform a countable number of families with three continuous parameters (ADM mass,\nADM angular momentum and Noether charge).

The role of e-ion recombination is\ndiscussed for both parent recombination and volume recombination.

These are stationary, asymptotically flat black hole (BH) spacetimes,\nthat are solutions of General Relativity minimally coupled to a massive,\ncomplex scalar field: Kerr BHs with scalar hair (KBHsSH). Such BHs bifurcate\nfrom the vacuum Kerr solution and can be regarded as a horizon within a\nrotating boson star. In a recent letter, it was shown that KBHsSH can exhibit\nvery distinct shadows from the ones of their vacuum counterparts. The setup\ntherein, however, considered the light source to be a celestial sphere\nsufficiently far away from the BH. Here, we analyse KBHsSH surrounded by an\nemitting torus of matter, simulating a more realistic astrophysical\nenvironment, and study the corresponding lensing of light as seen by a very far\naway observer, to appropriately model ground-based observations of Sgr A*. We\nfind that the differences in imaging between KBHsSH and comparable vacuum Kerr\nBHs remain, albeit less dramatic than those observed for the corresponding\nshadows in the previous setup. In particular, we highlight two observables that\nmight allow differentiating KBHsSH and Kerr BHs. The first is the angular size\nof the photon ring (in a Kerr spacetime) or lensing ring (in a KBHSH\nspacetime), the latter being significantly smaller for sufficiently\nnon-Kerr-like spacetimes. The second is the existence of an edge in the\nintensity distribution (the photon ring in Kerr spacetime). This edge can\ndisappear for very non-Kerr-like KBHsSH. It is plausible, therefore, that\nsufficiently precise Very Long Baseline Interferometric observations of BH\ncandidates can constrain this model. \n\n"}

We start with a system of $M0$-branes with high symmetry, which\njoin mutually and form pairs of $M1$-anti-$M1$-branes. The resulting symmetry\nbreaking creates gauge fields that live on the $M1$-branes and play the role of\ngraviton tensor modes, which induce an attractive force between the $M1$ and\nanti-$M1$ branes. Consequently, the gauge fields that live on the $M1$-branes,\nand the scalar fields which are attached symmetrically to all parts of these\nbranes, decay to fermions that attach anti-symmetrically to the upper and lower\nparts of the branes, and hence the Pauli exclusion principle emerges.

Recently, however, the hypothesis that the BH\ninterior does not exist has been gaining traction, as it provides a means for\nresolving the BH information-loss problem. Here, we propose a simple method for\nanswering the following question: Does the BH interior exist and, if so, does\nit contain some distribution of matter or is it mostly empty? Our proposal is\npremised on the idea that, similar to the case of relativistic, ultra-compact\nstars, any BH-like object whose interior has some matter distribution should\nsupport fluid modes in addition to the conventional spacetime modes. In\nparticular, the Coriolis-induced Rossby (r-) modes, whose spectrum is mostly\ninsensitive to the composition of the interior matter, should be a universal\nfeature of such BH-like objects. In fact, the frequency and damping time of\nthese modes are determined by only the object's mass and speed of rotation. The\nr-modes oscillate at a lower frequency, decay at a slower rate and produce\nweaker GWs than do modes of the spacetime class.

A generic feature of these models is the replacement of the\nhorizon by a reflective surface.

We\ninvestigate in detail a simple model consisting of scalar perturbations of a\nKerr geometry with a reflective surface near the horizon. The instability\ndepends on the spin, on the compactness, and on the reflectivity at the\nsurface. The instability time scale increases only logarithmically in the\nblack-hole limit and, for a perfectly reflecting object, this is not enough to\nprevent the instability from occurring on dynamical time scales. However, we\nfind that an absorption rate at the surface as small as 0.4% (reflectivity\ncoefficient as large as $|{\\cal R}|^2=0.996$) is sufficient to quench the\ninstability completely.

The latter is a scalar version of\nthe recently introduced Nonlinear Field Space Theory (NFST), where physical\nphase space of a given field is assumed to be compactified at large energies.\nFor our analysis we choose the simple case of a field with the spherical phase\nspace and endow it with the generalized Hamiltonian analogous to the XXZ\nHeisenberg model, normally describing a system of spins in condensed matter\nphysics. Subsequently, we study both the homogenous cosmological sector and\nlinear perturbations of such a test field. In the homogenous sector we find\nthat nonlinearity of the field phase space is becoming relevant for large\nvolumes of universe and then it can lead to a recollapse, and possibly also at\nvery high energies, leading to the phase of a bounce.

Using the Gravity Spy\ndataset, containing hand-labeled, multi-duration spectrograms obtained from\nreal LIGO data, we demonstrate that this method enables optimal use of very\ndeep convolutional neural networks for classification given small training\ndatasets, significantly reduces the time for training the networks, and\nachieves state-of-the-art accuracy above 98.8%, with perfect precision-recall\non 8 out of 22 classes.

In particular, steering of\ncontinuous variable Gaussian states has been extensively studied as a\nmanifestation of the EPR paradox. While most of these studies focused on\nquadrature measurements for steering detection, two recent works revealed that\nthere exist Gaussian states which are only steerable by non-Gaussian\nmeasurements. In this paper we perform a systematic investigation of EPR\nsteering of bipartite Gaussian states by pseudospin measurements, complementing\nand extending previous findings. We first derive the density matrix elements of\ntwo-mode squeezed thermal states in the Fock basis, which may be of independent\ninterest. We then use such a representation to investigate steering of these\nstates as detected by a nonlinear criterion, based on second moments of the\npseudospin correlation matrix. This analysis reveals previously unexplored\nregimes where non-Gaussian measurements are more effective than Gaussian ones\nto witness steering of Gaussian states in the presence of local noise. We\nfurther consider an alternative set of pseudospin observables, whose\nexpectation value can be expressed compactly in terms of Wigner functions for\nall two-mode Gaussian states. However, according to the adopted criterion,\nthese observables are found to be always less sensitive than Gaussian\nobservables for steering detection. Finally, we investigate continuous variable\nWerner states, which are non-Gaussian mixtures of Gaussian states, and find\nthat pseudospin measurements are always more effective than Gaussian ones to\nreveal their steerability.

The detection of this gravitational-wave signal, GW170817, offers a\nnovel opportunity to directly probe the properties of matter at the extreme\nconditions found in the interior of these stars. The initial,\nminimal-assumption analysis of the LIGO and Virgo data placed constraints on\nthe tidal effects of the coalescing bodies, which were then translated to\nconstraints on neutron star radii. Here, we expand upon previous analyses by\nworking under the hypothesis that both bodies were neutron stars that are\ndescribed by the same equation of state and have spins within the range\nobserved in Galactic binary neutron stars.

Both purposes require us to assume some functional form\nof the ellipticity distribution, and as a proof of principle we take two toy\ndistributions.

We show that by\nincorporating a common parameterized prior ellipticity distribution we can be\nmore efficient at detecting gravitational waves from the whole ensemble of\nsources than trying to combine observations with a simpler non-hierarchical\nmethod.

Axions are one key possibility to solve the strong CP problem and\naxion-like particles could be one solution to the dark matter puzzle. Given the\nnature of the coupling, and the universality of free fall, nontrivial important\neffects are expected in regions where gravity is strong. Here, we show that i.\nA background EM field induces an axionic instability in flat space, for large\nenough electric fields. Conversely, a homogeneous harmonic axion field induces\nan instability in the Maxwell sector. When carried over to curved spacetime,\nthis phenomena translates into generic instabilities of charged black holes\n(BHs). ii. In the presence of charge, BH uniqueness results are lost. We find\nsolutions which are small deformations of the Kerr-Newman geometry and hairy\nstationary solutions without angular momentum, which are `dragged' by the\naxion. Axion fields must exist around spinning BHs if these are immersed in\nexternal magnetic fields.

In this paper we consider numerically generated spacetimes of Kerr\nblack holes with synchronised scalar hair and build stationary models of\nmagnetized thick disks (or tori) around them.

As recently shown by Dimmelmeier et al (2002a,b), one\nof the most interesting such approximation is the so-called conformal flatness\ncondition (CFC) of Isenberg, Wilson and Mathews. Building on this previous work\nwe present here new results from numerical simulations of relativistic\nrotational core collapse in axisymmetry, aiming at improving the dynamics and\nthe gravitational waveforms.

{"id": "gr-qc/0409054", "contents": "Title: What is a particle? Abstract: Theoretical developments related to the gravitational interaction have\nquestioned the notion of particle in quantum field theory (QFT). For instance,\nuniquely-defined particle states do not exist in general, in QFT on a curved\nspacetime. More in general, particle states are difficult to define in a\nbackground-independent quantum theory of gravity. These difficulties have lead\nsome to suggest that in general QFT should not be interpreted in terms of\nparticle states, but rather in terms of eigenstates of local operators. Still,\nit is not obvious how to reconcile this view with the empirically-observed\nubiquitous particle-like behavior of quantum fields, apparent for instance in\nexperimental high-energy physics, or \"particle\"-physics. Here we offer an\nelement of clarification by observing that already in flat space there exist\n--strictly speaking-- two distinct notions of particles: globally defined\n$n$-particle Fock-states and *local particle states*. The last describe the\nphysical objects detected by finite-size particle detectors and are eigenstates\nof local field operators. In the limit in which the particle detectors are\nappropriately large, global and local particle states converge in a weak\ntopology (but not in norm). This observation has little relevance for\nflat-space theories --it amounts to a reminder that there are boundary effects\nin realistic detectors--; but is relevant for gravity. It reconciles the two\npoints of view mentioned above. More importantly, it provides a definition of\nlocal particle state that remains well-defined even when the conventional\nglobal particle states are not defined. This definition plays an important role\nin quantum gravity. \n\n"}

Previous post-\nNewtonian calculations of spin-orbit effects (at 1.5PN order) relied on a fluid\ndescription of the spinning bodies. We simplify the calculations by introducing\ninto post-Newtonian theory a delta-function description of the influence of the\nspins on the bodies' energy-momentum tensor.
