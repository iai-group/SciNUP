We constrain a\nmass-to-'observed' light ratio, M_h/L_band. For narrow-band surveys, L_band is\nsimply related to the intrinsic Ly-alpha luminosity with a survival fraction of\nLy-alpha photons, alpha_esc. The mass-to-'bolometric light', M_h/L_bol, can\nalso be deduced, once the metallicity and stellar mass spectrum are given. The\ninferred M_h/L_bol is more sensitive to metallicity than to the mass spectrum.\nWe find the following constraints on a mass-to-light ratio of Ly-alpha emitters\nfrom 5.7 < z < 7: (M_h/L_bol)(alpha_{esc}epsilon^{1/gamma})^{-1}=21-38, 14-26,\nand 9-17 for Z=0, 1/50, and 1 Z_sun, respectively, where epsilon is the 'duty\ncycle' of Ly-alpha emitters, and gamma ~ 2 is a local slope of the cumulative\nluminosity function. Only weak lower limits are obtained for z=8.8. Therefore,\nLy-alpha emitters are consistent with either starburst galaxies M_h/L_bol ~\n0.1-1 with a smaller Ly-alpha survival fraction, alpha_{esc}epsilon^{1/gamma}\n~0.01-0.05, or normal populations (M_h/L_bol ~ 10) if a good fraction of\nLy-alpha photons survived, alpha_{esc}epsilon^{1/gamma} ~ 0.5-1.

The former type of outflow could be ejecta that is\nejected during the prompt phase of a GRB and consists of a series of baryonic\nshells with a distribution of Lorentz factors, and the latter type could be an\nelectron-positron-pair wind that is driven by the post-burst central engine. We\nhere provide a unified description for the dynamics of fireballs based on these\ntwo types of energy injection, and calculate the corresponding high-energy\nphoton emission by considering synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton\nscattering (including synchrotron self-Compton and combined inverse-Compton) of\nelectrons. We find that, in the two energy-injection models, there is a plateau\n(even a hump) in high-energy light curves during the X-ray shallow decay phase.\nIn particular, a considerable fraction of the injecting energy in the\nlepton-dominated model can be shared by the long-lasting reverse shock since it\nis relativistic.

We identify tidal debris in the simulations according to the current\nbest surface brightness detection limits in M31 and demonstrate that bright\nfeatures in the outer halo regions usually originate from single satellites,\nwith very little contamination from other sources due to the low probability of\ntidal streams from two overlapping accretion events.

The Greater Importance of\n  Initial Conditions Compared to Metallicity Thresholds Abstract: The formation of the first stars out of metal-free gas appears to result in\nstars at least an order of magnitude more massive than in the present-day case.\nWe here consider what controls the transition from a primordial to a modern\ninitial mass function. It has been proposed that this occurs when effective\nmetal line cooling occurs at a metallicity threshold of Z/Z_sun > 10^{-3.5}. We\nstudy the influence of low levels of metal enrichment on the cooling and\ncollapse of initially ionized gas in small protogalactic halos using\nthree-dimensional, smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations with particle\nsplitting. Our initial conditions represent protogalaxies forming within a\npreviously ionized H ii region that has not yet had time to cool and recombine.\nThese differ considerably from those used in simulations predicting a\nmetallicity threshold, where the gas was initially cold and only partially\nionized. In the centrally condensed potential that we study here, a wide\nvariety of initial conditions for the gas yield a monolithic central collapse.\nOur models show no fragmentation during collapse to number densities as high as\n10^5 cm^{-3}, for metallicities reaching as high as 10^{-1} Z_sun in one\nrotating case, far above the threshold suggested by previous work. Rotation\nallows for the formation of gravitationally stable gas disks over large\nfractions of the local Hubble time. Turbulence slows the growth of the central\ndensity slightly, but both spherically symmetric and turbulent initial\nconditions collapse and form a single sink particle.

At $z<2.5$, quasar clustering depends weakly on\nluminosity and virial black hole mass, with typical uncertainty levels $\\sim\n10%$ for the measured correlation lengths. These weak dependences are\nconsistent with models in which substantial scatter between quasar luminosity,\nvirial black hole mass and the host dark matter halo mass has diluted any\nclustering difference, where halo mass is assumed to be the relevant quantity\nthat best correlates with clustering strength. However, the most luminous and\nmost massive quasars are more strongly clustered (at the $\\sim 2\\sigma$ level)\nthan the remainder of the sample, which we attribute to the rapid increase of\nthe bias factor at the high-mass end of host halos.

Abstract: Three planets with minimum masses less than 10 Earth masses orbit the star HD\n40307, suggesting these planets may be rocky. However, with only radial\nvelocity data, it is impossible to determine if these planets are rocky or\ngaseous. Here we exploit various dynamical features of the system in order to\nassess the physical properties of the planets. Observations allow for circular\norbits, but a numerical integration shows that the eccentricities must be at\nleast 0.0001. Also, planets b and c are so close to the star that tidal effects\nare significant. If planet b has tidal parameters similar to the terrestrial\nplanets in the Solar System and a remnant eccentricity larger than 0.001, then,\ngoing back in time, the system would have been unstable within the lifetime of\nthe star (which we estimate to be 6.1 +/- 1.6 Gyr). Moreover, if the\neccentricities are that large and the inner planet is rocky, then its tidal\nheating may be an order of magnitude greater than extremely volcanic Io, on a\nper unit surface area basis. If planet b is not terrestrial, e.g. Neptune-like,\nthese physical constraints would not apply. This analysis suggests the planets\nare not terrestrial-like, and are more like our giant planets. In either case,\nwe find that the planets probably formed at larger radii and migrated early-on\n(via disk interactions) into their current orbits.

We\nsuggest instead that the outbursts of RS Oph are thermal--viscous instabilities\nin a disc irradiated by the central accreting white dwarf. The distinctive\nfeature of RS Oph is the very large size of its accretion disc. Given this, it\nfits naturally into a consistent picture of systems with unstable accretion\ndiscs. This picture explains the presence and speed of the jets, the brightness\nand duration of the outburst, and its rise time and linear decay, as well as\nthe faintness of the quiescence. By contrast, the hitherto standard picture of\nrecurrent thermonuclear explosions has a number of severe difficulties. These\ninclude the presence of jets, the faintness of quiescence, and the fact the the\naccretion disc must be unstable unless it is far smaller than any reasonable\nestimate. \n\n"}

Solar-like p\nmodes are damped by convection, and hence the stability of the modes depends on\nthe lifetime.\n  We seek a simple scaling relation between the mean lifetime of the most\nprominent solar-like p modes in stars, and the fundamental stellar parameters.\n  We base our search for a relation on use of stellar equilibrium and pulsation\ncomputations of a grid of stellar models, and the first asteroseismic results\non lifetimes of main-sequence, sub-giant and red-giant stars.\n  We find that the mean lifetimes of all three classes of solar-like stars\nscale like $T_{\\rm eff}^{-4}$ (where $T_{\\rm eff}$ is the effective\ntemperature). When this relation is combined with the well-known scaling\nrelation of Kjeldsen & Bedding (1995) for mode amplitudes observed in\nnarrow-band intensity observations, we obtain the unexpected result that the\nheight (the maximum power spectral density) of mode peaks in the frequency\npower spectrum scales as $g^{-2}$ (where $g$ is the surface gravity). As it is\nthe mode height (and not the amplitude) that fixes the S/N at which the modes\ncan be measured, and as $g$ changes only slowly along the main sequence, this\nsuggests that stars cooler than the Sun might be as good targets for\nasteroseismology as their hotter counterparts. When observations are instead\nmade in Doppler velocity, our results imply that mode height then does increase\nwith increasing effective temperature. \n\n"}

We investigate the total MF and the\ncontribution of ETGs and LTGs, defined by different criteria (SED, morphology\nor star formation). We unveil a galaxy bimodality in the global MF, better\nrepresented by 2 Schechter functions dominated by ETGs and LTGs, respectively.\nFor the global population we confirm that low-mass galaxies number density\nincreases later and faster than for massive galaxies. We find that the MF\nevolution at intermediate-low values of Mstar (logM<10.6) is mostly explained\nby the growth in stellar mass driven by smoothly decreasing star formation\nactivities. The low residual evolution is consistent with ~0.16 merger per\ngalaxy per Gyr (of which fewer than 0.1 are major).

These tessellated reflectors comprise hundreds\nof mirror facets mounted on a space frame to achieve this large area at a\nreasonable cost. To achieve a reflecting surface of sufficient quality one must\nprecisely orient each facet using a procedure known as alignment. We describe\nhere an alignment system which uses a digital (CCD) camera placed at the focus\nof the optical system, facing the reflector. The camera acquires a series of\nimages of the reflector while the telescope scans a grid of points centred on\nthe direction of a bright star. Correctly aligned facets are brightest when the\ntelescope is pointed directly at the star, while mis-aligned facets are\nbrightest when the angle between the star and the telescope pointing direction\nis twice the misalignment angle of the facet. Data from this scan can be used\nto calculate the adjustments required to align each facet. We have constructed\nsuch a system and have tested it on three of the VERITAS IACTs. Using this\nsystem the optical point spread functions of the telescopes have been narrowed\nby more than 30%. We present here a description of the system and results from\ninitial use. \n\n"}

The eccentricity of the outer\nplanet (ec) is estimated to be 0.11(+0.17,-0.04), comparable to that of Saturn\n(0.01-0.09). The similarities between the OGLE-06-109L system and the solar\nsystem indicate that they may have passed through similar histories during\ntheir formation stage. In this paper we investigate the dynamics and formation\nof the orbital architecture in the OGLE-06-109L system. For the present two\nplanets with their nominal locations, the secular motions are stable as long as\ntheir eccentricities (eb; ec) fulfill eb^2 + ec^2 < = 0.3^2. Earth-size bodies\nmight be formed and are stable in the habitable zone (0.25AU-0.36AU) of the\nsystem. Three possible scenarios may be accounted for formation of eb and ec:\n(i) convergent migration of two planets and the 3:1 MMR trapping; (ii)\nplanetary scattering; (iii) divergent migration and the 3:1 MMR crossing. As we\nshowed that the probability for the two giant planets in 3:1 MMR is low (~3%),\nscenario (i) is less likely. According to models (ii) and (iii), the final\neccentricity of inner planet (eb) may oscillate between [0-0.06], comparable to\nthat of Jupiter (0.03-0.06). An inspection of eb, ec secular motion may be\nhelpful to understand which model is really responsible for the eccentricity\nformation. \n\n"}

In the submillimeter regime, Sgr A* exhibits time-variable\nlinear polarization on timescales corresponding to <10 Schwarzschild radii of\nthe presumed 4 million solar mass black hole. In previous work, we demonstrated\nthe potential for total-intensity (sub)millimeter-wavelength VLBI to detect\ntime-variable -- and periodic -- source structure changes in the Sgr A* black\nhole system using nonimaging analyses. Here we extend this work to include full\npolarimetric VLBI observations. We simulate full-polarization (sub)millimeter\nVLBI data of Sgr A* using a hot-spot model that is embedded within an accretion\ndisk, with emphasis on nonimaging polarimetric data products that are robust\nagainst calibration errors. Although the source-integrated linear polarization\nfraction in the models is typically only a few percent, the linear polarization\nfraction on small angular scales can be much higher, enabling the detection of\nchanges in the polarimetric structure of Sgr A* on a wide variety of baselines.\nThe shortest baselines track the source-integrated linear polarization\nfraction, while longer baselines are sensitive to polarization substructures\nthat are beam-diluted by connected-element interferometry. The detection of\nperiodic variability in source polarization should not be significantly\naffected even if instrumental polarization terms cannot be calibrated out.

Horizontal Branch\n  Morphology and the Second Parameter Phenomenon Abstract: The horizontal branch (HB) morphology of globular clusters (GCs) is most\nstrongly influenced by metallicity. The second parameter phenomenon\nacknowledges that metallicity alone is not enough to describe the HB morphology\nof all GCs. In particular, the outer Galactic halo contains GCs with redder HBs\nat a given metallicity than are found inside the Solar circle. Thus, at least a\nsecond parameter is required to characterize HB morphology. Here we analyze the\nmedian color difference between the HB and the red giant branch (RGB), d(V-I),\nmeasured from HST ACS photometry of 60 GCs within ~20 kpc of the Galactic\nCenter. Analysis of this homogeneous data set reveals that, after the influence\nof metallicity has been removed, the correlation between d(V-I) and age is\nstronger than that of any other parameter considered. Expanding the sample to\ninclude HST photometry of the 6 most distant Galactic GCs lends additional\nsupport to the correlation between d(V-I) and age. This result is robust with\nrespect to the adopted metallicity scale and the method of age determination,\nbut must bear the caveat that high quality, detailed abundance information is\nnot available for a significant fraction of the sample. When a subset of GCs\nwith similar metallicities and ages are considered, a correlation between\nd(V-I) and central luminosity density is exposed.

We show that, as tidal interaction with the central\nstar leads to small eccentricities, the planets in this system could be\nundergoing resonant coupling even though the period ratios depart significantly\nfrom very precise commensurability. In a three planet system, this is indicated\nby the fact that resonant angles librate or are associated with long term\nchanges to the orbital elements. We propose that the planets in HD 40307 were\nin a strict Laplace resonance while they migrated through the disc. After\nentering the disc inner cavity, tidal interaction would cause the period ratios\nto increase from two but with the inner pair deviating less than the outer\npair, counter to what occurs in HD 40307. However, the relationship between\nthese pairs that occurs in HD 40307 might be produced if the resonance is\nimpulsively modified by an event like a close encounter shortly after the\nplanetary system decouples from the disc.

Abstract: This paper is part of a multi-species survey of line emission from the\nmolecular gas in the circum-nuclear disk (CND) of the Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC1068.\nSingle-dish observations have provided evidence that the abundance of silicon\nmonoxide(SiO) in the CND of NGC1068 is enhanced by 3-4 orders of magnitude with\nrespect to the values typically measured in quiescent molecular gas in the\nGalaxy. We aim at unveiling the mechanism(s) underlying the SiO enhancement. We\nhave imaged with the IRAM Plateau de Bure interferometer the emission of the\nSiO(2-1) and CN(2--1) lines in NGC1068 at 150pc and 60pc spatial resolution,\nrespectively. We have also obtained complementary IRAM 30m observations of HNCO\nand methanol (CH3OH) lines. SiO is detected in a disk of 400pc size around the\nAGN. SiO abundances in the CND of (1-5)xE-09 are about 1-2 orders of magnitude\nabove those measured in the starburst ring. The overall abundance of CN in the\nCND is high: (0.2-1)xE-07. The abundances of SiO and CN are enhanced at the\nextreme velocities of gas associated with non-circular motions close to the AGN\n(r<70pc). Abundances measured for CN and SiO, and the correlation of CN/CO and\nSiO/CO ratios with hard X-ray irradiation, suggest that the CND of NGC1068 has\nbecome a giant X-ray dominated region (XDR). The extreme properties of\nmolecular gas in the circum-nuclear molecular disk of NGC1068 result from the\ninterplay between different processes directly linked to nuclear activity.\nWhereas XDR chemistry offers a simple explanation for CN and SiO in NGC1068,\nthe relevance of shocks deserves further scrutiny.

Within the framework of\nclassical error models, the dependent variable relates to the independent\nvariable according to the usual additive model. Linear models of regression\nlines are considered in the general case of correlated errors in X and in Y for\nheteroscedastic data. The special case of (C) generalized orthogonal regression\nis considered in detail together with well known subcases. In the limit of\nhomoscedastic data, the results determined for functional models are compared\nwith their counterparts related to extreme structural models. While regression\nline slope and intercept estimators for functional and structural models\nnecessarily coincide, the contrary holds for related variance estimators even\nif the residuals obey a Gaussian distribution, with a single exception. An\nexample of astronomical application is considered, concerning the [O/H]-[Fe/H]\nempirical relations deduced from five samples related to different stars and/or\ndifferent methods of oxygen abundance determination. For selected samples and\nassigned methods, different regression models yield consistent results within\nthe errors for both heteroscedastic and homoscedastic data. Conversely, samples\nrelated to different methods produce discrepant results, due to the presence of\n(still undetected) systematic errors, which implies no definitive statement can\nbe made at present. A comparison is also made between different expressions of\nregression line slope and intercept variance estimators, where fractional\ndiscrepancies are found to be not exceeding a few percent, which grows up to\nabout 20% in presence of large dispersion data. \n\n"}

The overall\ngoal of our research is to study the time evolution of these high-energy\nemissions as an essential input to studing exoplanetary atmospheres.\n  We propose to determine stellar ages with a methodology based on wide\nbinaries. We are interested in systems composed of a low-mass star and a white\ndwarf (WD), where the latter serves as a stellar chronometer for the system. We\naim at obtaining reliable ages for a sample of late-type stars older than 1\nGyr.\n  We selected a sample of wide binaries composed by a DA type WD and a GKM\ncompanion. High signal-to-noise, low-resolution spectroscopic observations were\nobtained for most of the WD members of the sample.

Taking advantage of the wide field of view available using the PTF\ncamera at the Palomar 48\" telescope, 40 nights were dedicated in December\n2009-January 2010 to perform continuous high-cadence differential photometry on\na single field containing the young (7-10Myr) 25 Ori association. The primary\nmotivation for the project is to search for planets around young stars in this\nregion. The unique data set also provides for much ancillary science.

{"id": "1106.4179", "contents": "Title: Formation of stars and planets: the role of magnetic fields Abstract: Star formation is thought to be triggered by gravitational collapse of the\ndense cores of molecular clouds. Angular momentum conservation during the\ncollapse results in the progressive increase of the centrifugal force, which\neventually halts the inflow of material and leads to the development of a\ncentral mass surrounded by a disc. In the presence of an angular momentum\ntransport mechanism, mass accretion onto the central object proceeds through\nthis disc, and it is believed that this is how stars typically gain most of\ntheir mass. However, the mechanisms responsible for this transport of angular\nmomentum are not well understood. Although the gravitational field of a\ncompanion star or even gravitational instabilities (particularly in massive\ndiscs) may play a role, the most general mechanisms are turbulence viscosity\ndriven by the magnetorotational instability (MRI), and outflows accelerated\ncentrifugally from the surfaces of the disc. Both processes are powered by the\naction of magnetic fields and are, in turn, likely to strongly affect the\nstructure, dynamics, evolutionary path and planet-forming capabilities of their\nhost discs. The weak ionisation of protostellar discs, however, may prevent the\nmagnetic field from effectively coupling to the gas and shear and driving these\nprocesses. Here I examine the viability and properties of these\nmagnetically-driven processes in protostellar discs. The results indicate that,\ndespite the weak ionisation, the magnetic field is able to couple to the gas\nand shear for fluid conditions thought to be satisfied over a wide range of\nradii in these discs. \n\n"}

In astronomy, the increasing scale of current and future\nsurveys is driving a trend towards a separation of the processes of low-level\ndata reduction and higher-level scientific analysis. Algorithms and software\nresponsible for the former are becoming increasingly complex, and at the same\ntime more general - measurements will be used for a wide variety of scientific\nstudies, and many of these cannot be anticipated in advance. On the other hand,\nincreased sample sizes and the corresponding decrease in stochastic uncertainty\nputs greater importance on controlling systematic errors, which must happen for\nthe most part at the lowest levels of data analysis. Astronomical measurement\nalgorithms must improve in their handling of uncertainties as well, and hence\nmust be designed with detailed knowledge of the requirements of different\nscience goals. In this thesis, we advocate a Bayesian approach to survey data\nreduction as a whole, and focus specifically on the problem of modeling\nindividual galaxies and stars. We present a Monte Carlo algorithm that can\nefficiently sample from the posterior probability for a flexible class of\ngalaxy models, and propose a method for constructing and convolving these\nmodels using Gauss-Hermite (\"shapelet\") functions.

In cosmology, it is used to quantify large-scale structure\n(LSS) and the cosmic microwave background (CMB). This is because the power\nspectrum completely quantifies Gaussian random fields, which the CMB and LSS\nfields seem to be at early epochs. However, at late epochs and small scales,\ncosmological density fields become highly non-Gaussian. The power spectrum\nloses power to describe LSS and CMB fields on small scales, most obviously\nthrough high covariance in the power spectrum as a function of scale.\nPractically, this significantly degrades constraints that observations can\nplace on cosmological parameters. However, if a nonlinear transformation that\nproduces a (more) Gaussian 1-point distribution is applied to a field, the\nextra covariance in the field's power spectrum can be dramatically reduced. In\nthe case of the roughly lognormal low-redshift matter density field, a log\ntransform accomplishes this.

Here, for the first time, we apply\nthe technique of optimal estimation to determine the thermal structure and\ncomposition of an exoplanet by solving the inverse problem. The development of\na suite of radiative transfer and retrieval tools for exoplanet atmospheres is\ndescribed, building upon a retrieval algorithm which is extensively used in the\nstudy of our own solar system.

Additionally, we use\ncontribution functions to assess the vertical sensitivity of the emission\nspectrum to temperatures and molecular composition. Over the altitudes probed\nby the contribution functions, the retrieved thermal structure shows an\nisothermal upper atmosphere overlying a deeper adiabatic layer (temperature\ndecreasing with altitude), which is consistent with previously-reported\ndynamical and observational results. The formal uncertainties on retrieved\nparameters are estimated conservatively using an analysis of the\ncross-correlation functions and the degeneracy between different atmospheric\nproperties.

We have full timing solutions that measure the spin,\nastrometric, and (where applicable) binary parameters for six of these pulsars.\nThe remaining three pulsars (reported here for the first time) were not\ndetected enough to establish solutions. We also report our timing solutions for\nfive pulsars with previously published solutions, and find good agreement with\npast authors, except for PSR J1701-3006B in M62.

Here we examine the apparent radius in a\nhomogeneous sample of long, mixed H/He bursts from the low-mass X-ray binaries\nGS 1826-24 and KS 1731-26. The measured blackbody normalisation (proportional\nto the emitting area) in these bursts is constant over a period of up to 60s in\nthe burst tail, even though the flux (blackbody temperature) decreased by a\nfactor of 60-75% (30-40%). The typical rms variation in the mean normalisation\nfrom burst to burst was 3-5%, although a variation of 17% was found between\nbursts observed from GS 1826-24 in two epochs. A comparison of the\ntime-resolved spectroscopic measurements during bursts from the two epochs\nshows that the normalisation evolves consistently through the burst rise and\npeak, but subsequently increases further in the earlier epoch bursts. The\nelevated normalisation values may arise from a change in the anisotropy of the\nburst emission, or alternatively variations in the spectral correction factor,\nf_c, of order 10%.

Six\nleading Neptune Trojans around the Lagrange point L4 discovered earlier have\nbeen studied in detail, but two trailing ones found recently around the L5\npoint, 2004 KV18 and 2008 LC18, have not been investigated yet. In this paper,\nwe report our investigations on the dynamical behaviors of these two new\nNeptune Trojans. Our calculations show that the asteroid 2004 KV18 is a\ntemporary Neptune Trojan. Most probably, it was captured into the trailing\nTrojan cloud no earlier than 203kyr ago, and it will not keep this identity no\nlater than 165kyr in future. Based on the statistics on our orbital\nsimulations, we argue that this object is more like a scattered Kuiper belt\nobject. On the contrary, the orbit of asteroid 2008 LC18 is much more stable.\nAmong the clone orbits spread within the orbital uncertainties, a considerable\nportion of clones may survive on the L5 tadpole orbits for 4Gyr. The strong\ndependence of the stability on the semimajor axis and resonant angle suggests\nthat further observations are badly needed to confine the orbit in the stable\nregion.

However, much less is known about the content and physical status of\nthe hot X-ray gas in low-mass ellipticals. In the present paper we study the\nX-ray gas content of four low-mass elliptical galaxies using archival Chandra\nX-ray observations. The sample galaxies, NGC821, NGC3379, NGC4278, and NGC4697,\nhave approximately identical K-band luminosities, and hence stellar masses, yet\ntheir X-ray appearance is strikingly different. We conclude that the unresolved\nemission in NGC821 and NGC3379 is built up from a multitude of faint compact\nobjects, such as coronally active binaries and cataclysmic variables. Despite\nthe non-detection of X-ray gas, these galaxies may host low density, and hence\nlow luminosity, X-ray gas components, which undergo a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia)\ndriven outflow. We detect hot X-ray gas with a temperature of kT ~ 0.35 keV in\nNGC4278, the component of which has a steeper surface brightness distribution\nthan the stellar light. Within the central 50 arcsec (~3.9 kpc) the estimated\ngas mass is ~3 x 10^7 M_sun, implying a gas mass fraction of ~0.06%. We\ndemonstrate that the X-ray gas exhibits a bipolar morphology in the\nnortheast-southwest direction, indicating that it may be outflowing from the\ngalaxy. The mass and energy budget of the outflow can be maintained by evolved\nstars and SNe Ia, respectively. The X-ray gas in NGC4697 has an average\ntemperature of kT ~ 0.3 keV, and a significantly broader distribution than the\nstellar light. The total gas mass within 90 arcsec (~5.1 kpc) is ~2.1 x 10^8\nM_sun, hence the gas mass fraction is ~0.4%.

High-resolution spectroscopy of the\nhost star yields T_eff = 6427 +/- 33 K, log(g) = 4.52 +/- 0.14, and\n[Fe/H]=-0.04 +/- 0.05. These parameters, combined with the broad-band spectral\nenergy distribution and parallax, allow us to infer a mass and radius of the\nhost star of M_1=1.21 +/- 0.08 M_\\odot and R_1=1.09_{-0.13}^{+0.15} R_\\odot. We\nare able to exclude transits of the inner companion with high confidence. The\nhost star's spectrum exhibits clear Ca H and K core emission indicating stellar\nactivity, but a lack of photometric variability and small v*sin(I) suggest the\nprimary's spin axis is oriented in a pole-on configuration. The rotational\nperiod of the primary from an activity-rotation relation matches the orbital\nperiod of the inner companion to within 1.5 \\sigma, suggesting they are tidally\nlocked. If the inner companion's orbital angular momentum vector is aligned\nwith the stellar spin axis, as expected through tidal evolution, then it has a\nstellar mass of M_2 ~ 0.3-0.4 M_\\odot.

For a\ngiven mass, many planets have inflated radii, while others are surprisingly\ncompact and may harbor large central cores. Motivated by the observational\nsample, this paper considers possible effects from collisions of smaller rocky\nplanets with gas giant planets. In this scenario, the Jovian planets migrate\nfirst and enter into (approximately) 4 day orbits, whereas rocky planets (mass\n= 0.1-20 that of Earth) migrate later and then encounter the gaseous giants.\nPrevious work indicates that the collision rates are high for such systems.\nThis paper calculates the trajectories of incoming rocky planets as they orbit\nwithin the gaseous planets and are subjected to gravitational, frictional, and\ntidal forces. These collisions always increase the metallicity of the Jovian\nplanets. If the incoming rocky bodies survive tidal destruction and reach the\ncentral regions, they provide a means of producing large planetary cores. Both\nthe added metallicity and larger cores act to decrease the radii of the gas\ngiants at fixed mass. The energy released during these collisions provides the\nJovian planet with an additional heat source; here we determine the radial\nlayers where kinetic energy of the colliding body is dissipated, including the\nenergy remaining upon impact with the existing core. This process could have\nlong-term effects if the colliding body deposits significant energy deep in the\ninterior, in regions of high opacity. Both Hot Jupiters and newly formed gas\ngiants have inflated radii, large enough to allow incoming rocky planets to\nsurvive tidal disruption, enhance the central core mass, and deposit\nsignificant energy (in contrast, denser giant planets with the mass and radius\nof Jupiter are expected to tidally destroy incoming rocky bodies). \n\n"}

This is\nimportant because the silicate weathering feedback determines the width of the\nhabitable zone in space and time. Here a low-order model of weathering and\nclimate, useful for gaining qualitative understanding, is developed to examine\nclimate evolution for planets of various land-ocean fractions. It is pointed\nout that, if seafloor weathering does not depend directly on surface\ntemperature, there can be no weathering-climate feedback on a waterworld. This\nwould dramatically narrow the habitable zone of a waterworld. Results from our\nmodel indicate that weathering behavior does not depend strongly on land\nfraction for partially ocean-covered planets.

Liquid xenon is widely considered to\nbe one of the best target media for detection of WIMPs (Weakly Interacting\nMassive Particles which may form the galactic dark matter) using nuclear\nrecoils. Since these detectors also provide an extremely low radioactivity\nenvironment for electron recoils, very weakly-interacting low-mass particles (<\n100 keV/c^2), such as the hypothetical axion, could be detected as well - in\nthis case using the axio-electric effect. Future ton-scale liquid Xe detectors\nwill be limited in sensitivity only by irreducible neutrino background\n(pp-chain solar neutrino and the double beta decay of 136Xe) in the mass range\nbetween 1 and 100 keV/c^2.

The shapes of the filters are based on the gaps that develop in\nsimulations of dark matter sub-halos crossing a star stream. The high Galactic\nlatitude 8.4 kpc long segment of GD-1 that we examine has 8+/-3 gaps of 99%\nsignificance or greater, with the error estimated on the basis of tests of the\ngap-filtering technique. The cumulative distribution of gaps more than 3 times\nthe width of the stream is in good agreement with predictions for dark matter\nsub-halo encounters with cold star streams. The number of gaps narrower than 3\ntimes the width of the GD-1 stream falls well below the cold stream prediction\nwhich is taken into account for the gap creation rate integrated over all\nsizes.

The primary concern of this work\nis the development of NIR observation and reduction methods to recover a\nuniform surface brightness map across the 3x1 degree disk of M31. This\nnecessitates sky-target nodding across 27 WIRCam fields. Two sky-target nodding\nstrategies were tested, and we find that strictly minimizing sky sampling\nlatency does not maximize sky subtraction accuracy, which is at best 2% of the\nsky level. The mean surface brightness difference between blocks in our mosaic\ncan be reduced from 1% to 0.1% of the sky brightness by introducing scalar sky\noffsets to each image. The true surface brightness of M31 can be known to\nwithin a statistical zeropoint of 0.15% of the sky level (0.2 mag arcsec sq.\nuncertainty at R=15 kpc). Surface brightness stability across individual WIRCam\nframes is limited by both WIRCam flat field evolution and residual sky\nbackground shapes.

The X3.9 class event\nshows dramatically different energy dependences for the acceleration and\nscattering timescales, while the M2.1 class event shows a milder difference.\nThe M2.1 class event could be consistent with the stochastic acceleration model\nwith a very steep turbulence spectrum. A likely explanation of the X3.9 class\nevent could be that the escape of electrons from the acceleration region is not\ngoverned by a random walk process, but instead is affected by magnetic\nmirroring, in which the scattering time is proportional to the escape time and\nhas an energy dependence similar to the energy diffusion time. \n\n"}

At the same time, a large dynamic range and high\nresolution of low-amplitude signals in a single readout channel per pixel is\nachieved using compression of high amplitude signals in the preamplifier and\nsignal processing in the FPGA. The readout of the front-end modules into a\ncamera server is Ethernet-based using standard Ethernet switches. In its\ncurrent implementation, data transfer and backend processing rates of ~3.8\nGBytes/sec have been achieved. Together with the dead-time-free front end event\nbuffering on the FPGAs, this permits the cameras to operate at trigger rates of\nup to several tens of kHz.\n  In the horizontal architecture of FlashCam, the photon detector plane (PDP),\nconsisting of photon detectors, preamplifiers, high voltage-, control-, and\nmonitoring systems, is a self-contained unit, which is interfaced through\nanalogue signal transmission to the digital readout system.

Namely, for sufficiently\nlarge perturbed black objects (with long-lived quasinormal modes), nonlinear\neffects transfer energy from short to long wavelength modes via a turbulent\ncascade within the metric perturbation.

While the isotopic compositions of low-density\ngraphite grains indicate an origin in core-collapse supernovae, some\nhigh-density grains have extreme isotopic anomalies in C, Ca and Ti, which\ncannot be explained by envelope predictions of asymptotic giant branch (AGB)\nstars or theoretical supernova models. The Ca and Ti isotopic anomalies,\nhowever, match the predictions of He-shell abundances in AGB stars. In this\nstudy, we show that the C, Ca, and Ti isotopic anomalies are consistent with\nnucleosynthesis predictions of the H-ingestion phase during a very late thermal\npulse (VLTP) event in post-AGB stars. The low $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C isotopic ratios\nin these grains are a result of abundant $^{12}$C efficiently capturing the\nprotons that are being ingested during the VLTP. Very high neutron densities of\n$\\sim 10^{15}$ cm$^{-3}$, typical of the $i$-process, are achieved during this\nphase in post-AGB stars. The large $^{42,43,44}$Ca excesses in some graphite\ngrains are indicative of neutron capture nucleosynthesis during VLTP.

Systems are stable on\nthe MS if the planets are separated by more than ~9 Hill radii. Most systems\nsurviving the MS will remain stable until the WD phase, although planets\nscattered onto small pericentres in unstable systems can be swallowed by the\nexpanding stellar envelope when the star ascends the giant branches. Mass loss\nat the end of the asymptotic giant branch triggers delayed instability in many\nsystems, leading to instabilities typically occurring at WD cooling ages of a\nfew 100 Myr. This instability occurs both in systems that survived the star's\nprevious evolution unscathed, and in systems that previously underwent\nscattering instabilities. The outcome of such instability around WDs is\noverwhelmingly the ejection of one of the planets from the system, with several\ntimes more ejections occurring during the WD phase than during the MS.\nFurthermore, few planets are scattered close to the WD, just outside the Roche\nlimit, where they can be tidally circularised.

Thus, together with a measurement of the velocity\nof the line-emitting gas, e.g., via the width of BLR lines, such as Mg II, a\nsingle observation can therefore in principle provide a determination of the\nblack hole's mass; and (2) the identification of quasar ULAS J1120+0641 at z =\n7.085, which has significantly extended the redshift range of these sources,\nproviding essential leverage when fitting theoretical luminosity distances to\nthe data.

Due to its design, contamination from eclipsing\nbinaries, variable stars, and other transiting planets results in a significant\nnumber of these signals being false positives. This directly affects the\ndetermination of the occurrence rate of Earth-like planets in our Galaxy, as\nwell as other planet population statistics.

It is, however, extremely challenging to compute.\nThis paper presents a geometric-path Monte Carlo method, inspired by\nmulti-canonical Monte Carlo to evaluate the fully marginalized likelihood. We\nshow that the algorithm is very fast and easy to implement and produces a\njustified uncertainty estimate on the fully marginalized likelihood. The\nalgorithm performs efficiently on a trial problem and multi-companion model\nfitting for radial velocity data. For the trial problem, the algorithm returns\nthe correct fully marginalized likelihood, and the estimated uncertainty is\nalso consistent with the standard deviation of results from multiple runs. We\napply the algorithm to the problem of fitting radial velocity data from HIP\n88048 ($\\nu$ Oph) and Gliese 581.

In microlensing events, the light centroid shift in the source\ntrajectory (the astrometric trajectory) falls off much more slowly than the\nlight amplification as the source distance from the lens position increases. As\na result, perturbations developed with time such as lens orbital motion can\nmake considerable deviations in astrometric trajectories. The rotation of the\nsource trajectory due to lens orbital motion produces a more detectable\nastrometric deviation because the astrometric cross-section is much larger than\nthe photometric one.

Because these systems may be difficult to\nexplain in the paradigm of core accretion and disk migration, it has been\nsuggested that they formed in situ within protoplanetary disks with high solid\nsurface densities. The strong connection between giant planet occurrence and\nstellar metallicity is thought to be linked to enhanced solid surface densities\nin disks around metal-rich stars, so the presence of a giant planet can be a\ndetectable sign of planet formation in a high solid surface density disk. I\nformulate quantitative predictions for the frequency of long-period giant\nplanets in these in situ models of planet formation by translating the proposed\nincrease in disk mass into an equivalent metallicity enhancement. I rederive\nthe scaling of giant planet occurrence with metallicity as P_gp =\n0.05_{-0.02}^{+0.02} x 10^{(2.1 +/- 0.4) [M/H]} = 0.08_{-0.03}^{+0.02} x\n10^{(2.3 +/- 0.4) [Fe/H]} and show that there is significant tension between\nthe frequency of giant planets suggested by the minimum mass extrasolar nebula\nscenario and the observational upper limits.

The generalized shear\nterm represents the particles' memory of the spatial flow velocity difference\nacross the particle distance in the past, while the acceleration term is\nassociated with the temporal flow velocity difference on individual particle\ntrajectories. Using the simulation of Paper I, we compute the root-mean-square\nrelative velocity, <w^2>^1/2, as a function of the friction times, tau_p1 and\ntau_p2, of the two particles, and show that the PP10 prediction is in\nsatisfactory agreement with the data, confirming its physical picture. For a\ngiven tau_p1 below the Lagrangian correlation time of the flow, T_L, <w^2>^1/2\nas a function of tau_p2 shows a dip at tau_p2~tau_p1, indicating tighter\nvelocity correlation between similar particles. Defining a ratio\nf=tau_pl/tau_ph, with tau_pl and tau_ph the friction times of the smaller and\nlarger particles, we find that <w^2>^1/2 increases with decreasing f due to the\ngeneralized acceleration contribution, which dominates at f<1/4. At a fixed f,\nour model predicts that <w^2>^1/2 scales as tau_ph^1/2 for tau_p,h in the\ninertial range of the flow, stays roughly constant for T_L <tau_ph < T_L/f, and\nfinally decreases as tau_ph^-1/2 for tau_ph>>T_L/f.

Our sample consists of 104\nmagnetic maps of 73 stars, from accreting pre-main sequence to main-sequence\nobjects (1 Myr < t < 10 Gyr). For non-accreting dwarfs we empirically find that\nthe unsigned average large-scale surface field <|Bv|> is related to age as\n$t^{-0.655 \\pm 0.045}$. This relation has a similar dependence to that\nidentified by Skumanich (1972), used as the basis for gyrochronology. Likewise,\nour relation could be used as an age-dating method (\"magnetochronology\"). The\ntrends with rotation we find for the large-scale stellar magnetism are\nconsistent with the trends found from Zeeman broadening measurements (sensitive\nto large- and small-scale fields). These similarities indicate that the fields\nrecovered from both techniques are coupled to each other, suggesting that\nsmall- and large-scale fields could share the same dynamo field generation\nprocesses.

Recent\ndetections have yielded enough information about this class of exoplanets to\nbegin characterizing their occurrence rates, orbits, masses, densities, and\ninternal structures. The Kepler mission finds the smallest planets to be most\ncommon, as 26% of Sun-like stars have small, 1-2 R_e planets with orbital\nperiods under 100 days, and 11% have 1-2 R_e planets that receive 1-4x the\nincident stellar flux that warms our Earth. These Earth-size planets are\nsprinkled uniformly with orbital distance (logarithmically) out to 0.4 AU, and\nprobably beyond. Mass measurements for 33 transiting planets of 1-4 R_e show\nthat the smallest of them, R < 1.5 R_e, have the density expected for rocky\nplanets. Their densities increase with increasing radius, likely caused by\ngravitational compression. Including solar system planets yields a relation:\nrho = 2.32 + 3.19 R/R_e [g/cc]. Larger planets, in the radius range 1.5-4.0\nR_e, have densities that decline with increasing radius, revealing increasing\namounts of low-density material in an envelope surrounding a rocky core,\nbefitting the appellation \"mini-Neptunes.\" Planets of ~1.5 R_e have the highest\ndensities, averaging near 10 g/cc. The gas giant planets occur preferentially\naround stars that are rich in heavy elements, while rocky planets occur around\nstars having a range of heavy element abundances. One explanation is that the\nfast formation of rocky cores in protoplanetary disks enriched in heavy\nelements permits the gravitational accumulation of gas before it vanishes,\nforming giant planets. But models of the formation of 1-4 R_e planets remain\nuncertain. Defining habitable zones remains difficult, without benefit of\neither detections of life elsewhere or an understanding of life's biochemical\norigins. \n\n"}

To constrain the orbit of this planet, we used the\nmeasured duration of the unexplained transit event ($\\sim 4.15$ hours) and\ncompared that with the transit duration of the third planet in an ensemble of\nstable orbits. To remove the degeneracy among the orbits with similar transit\ndurations, we considered the planet to be in a circular orbit and calculated\nits period analytically.

The standard LK mechanism\nconsists of large-amplitude oscillations in eccentricity and inclination of a\nbinary subject to the quadrupole potential from an outer perturber. Recent work\nhas shown that when the octupole terms are included in the potential, the inner\nbinary can reach more extreme eccentricities as well as undergo orientation\nflips. It is known that pericenter precessions due to short-range effects, such\nas General Relativity and tidal and rotational distortions, can limit the\ngrowth of eccentricity and even suppress standard (quadrupolar) LK\noscillations, but their effect on the octupole-level LK mechanism has not been\nfully explored. In this paper, we systematically study how these short-range\nforces affect the extreme orbital behaviour found in octupole LK cycles. In\ngeneral, the influence of the octupole potential is confined to a range of\ninitial mutual inclinations Itot centered around 90deg (when the inner binary\nmass ratio is <<1), with this range expanding with increasing octupole\nstrength. We find that, while the short-range forces do not change the width\nand location of this \"window of influence\", they impose a strict upper limit on\nthe maximum achievable eccentricity. This limiting eccentricity can be\ncalculated analytically, and its value holds even for strong octupole potential\nand for the general case of three comparable masses.

These spot pair events are\n{\\it not} particle pair events -- they are the sudden creation or annihilation\nof a pair of relatively illuminated spots on a scattering surface. Real spot\npair illumination events occur unambiguously on the scattering surface when\nspot speeds diverge, while virtual spot pair events are observer dependent and\nperceived only when real spot radial speeds cross the speed of light.\nSpecifically, a virtual spot pair creation event will be observed when a real\nspot's speed toward the observer drops below $c$, while a virtual spot pair\nannihilation event will be observed when a real spot's radial speed away from\nthe observer rises above $c$. Superluminal spot pair events might be found\nangularly, photometrically, or polarimetrically, and might carry useful\ngeometry or distance information.

This concept is particularly suited\nfor upcoming/on-going large imaging surveys, in which only several broad-band\nfilters are available and it is hard to break some of the degeneracies in the\nmulti-color space. We construct model templates of galaxies using a stellar\npopulation synthesis code and apply Bayesian priors on physical properties such\nas stellar mass and star formation rate. These priors are a function of\nredshift and they effectively evolve the templates with time in an\nobservationally motivated way. We demonstrate that the priors help reduce the\ndegeneracy and deliver significantly improved photometric redshifts.\nFurthermore, we show that a template error function, which corrects for\nsystematic flux errors in the model templates as a function of rest-frame\nwavelength, delivers further improvements. One great advantage of our technique\nis that we simultaneously measure redshifts and physical properties of galaxies\nin a fully self-consistent manner, unlike the two-step measurements with\ndifferent templates often performed in the literature.

The main difference to the usual case is that all explicit fermion\nmass terms including Majorana masses for neutrinos are forbidden. All fermion\nmass terms arise therefore from vacuum expectation values of suitable scalars\ntimes some Yukawa couplings. This leads to interesting consequences for model\nbuilding, neutrino mass phenomenology and the Dark Matter abundance.

RW Aur A is a classical T Tauri star (CTTS) with an unusually rich\nemission line spectrum. In 2014 the star faded by ~ 3 magnitudes in the V band\nand went into a long-lasting minimum. In 2010 the star suffered from a similar\nfading, although less deep. These events in RW Aur A are very unusual among the\nCTTS, and have been attributed to occultations by passing dust clouds. Aims. We\nwant to find out if any spectral changes took place after the last fading of RW\nAur A with the intention to gather more information on the occulting body and\nthe cause of the phenomenon. Methods. We collected spectra of the two\ncomponents of RW Aur. Photometry was made before and during the minimum.\nResults. The overall spectral signatures reflecting emission from accretion\nflows from disk to star did not change after the fading. However, blue-shifted\nabsorption components related to the stellar wind had increased in strength in\ncertain resonance lines, and the profiles and strengths, but not fluxes, of\nforbidden lines had become drastically different. Conclusions. The extinction\nthrough the obscuring cloud is grey indicating the presence of large dust\ngrains. At the same time, there are no traces of related absorbing gas. The\ncloud occults the star and the interior part of the stellar wind, but not the\nwind/jet further out. The dimming in 2014 was not accompanied by changes in the\naccretion flows at the stellar surface. There is evidence that the structure\nand velocity pattern of the stellar wind did change significantly. The dimmings\ncould be related to passing condensations in a tidally disrupted disk, as\nproposed earlier, but we also speculate that large dust grains have been\nstirred up from the inclined disk into the line-of-sight through the\ninteraction with an enhanced wind. \n\n"}

This grid is conceptually\nsimilar to the Gauss-Legendre (GL) grid, aligning sample points with\niso-latitude rings located on Legendre polynomial zeros. Unlike the GL grid,\nhowever, the number of grid points per ring varies as a function of latitude,\navoiding expensive over-sampling near the poles and ensuring nearly equal sky\narea per grid point. The ratio between the number of grid points in two\nneighbouring rings is required to be a low-order rational number (3, 2, 1, 4/3,\n5/4 or 6/5) to maintain a high degree of symmetries. Our main motivation for\nthis grid is to solve linear systems using multi-grid methods, and to construct\nefficient preconditioners through pixel-space sampling of the linear operator\nin question. The GL grid is not suitable for these purposes due to its massive\nover-sampling near the poles, leading to nearly degenerate linear systems,\nwhile HEALPix, another commonly used spherical grid, exhibits few symmetries,\nand is therefore computationally inefficient for these purposes. As a benchmark\nand representative example, we compute a preconditioner for a linear system\nwith both HEALPix and SymPix that involves the operator $D + B^T N^{-1} B$,\nwhere $B$ and $D$ may be described as both local and rotationally invariant\noperators, and $N$ is diagonal in pixel domain.

The logotropic model depends on a\nsingle parameter $B=A/\\rho_{\\Lambda}c^2$ where $\\rho_{\\Lambda}$ is the\ncosmological density. For $B=0$, we recover the $\\Lambda$CDM model.

When $B>0$, pressure gradients prevent gravitational\ncollapse and provide halo density cores instead of cuspy density profiles, in\nagreement with the observations. The universal rotation curve of logotropic\ndark matter halos is consistent with the observational Burkert profile up to\nthe halo radius.

The solutions show two extreme cases: close-in\ngiant gaseous planets, with fast relaxation (low viscosity) and satellites and\nEarth-like planets, with slow relaxation (high viscosity). The rotation of\nclose-in gaseous planets follows the classical Darwinian pattern: it is tidally\ndriven towards a stationary solution which is synchronized, but, if the orbit\nis elliptical, with a frequency larger than the orbital mean-motion. The\nrotation of rocky bodies, however, may be driven to several attractors whose\nfrequencies are 1/2,1,3/2,2,5/2 ... times the mean-motion. The number of\nattractors increases with the viscosity of the body and with the orbital\neccentricity. The classical example is Mercury, whose rotational period is 2/3\nof the orbital period (3/2 attractor). The planet behaves as a molten body with\na relaxation that allowed it to cross the 2/1 attractor without being trapped,\nbut not to escape being trapped in the 3/2 one.

CP stars exhibiting this phenomenon are normally\nclassified as alpha2 Canum Venaticorum (ACV) variables. It is important to\nincrease the sample of known rotational periods among CP stars by discovering\nnew ACV variables. The ASAS-3 data were cross-correlated with the Catalogue of\nAp, HgMn, and Am stars in order to analyse the light curves of bona fide CP and\nrelated stars. The light curves were downloaded and cleaned of outliers and\ndata points with a flag indicating bad quality. Promising candidates showing a\nlarger scatter than observed for constant stars in the corresponding magnitude\nrange were searched for periodic signals using a standard Fourier technique. In\ntotal, we found 323 variables, from which 246 are reported here for the first\ntime, and 77 were probably wrongly classified before. The observed variability\npattern of most stars is in accordance with an ACV classification. For some\ncases, it is difficult to distinguish between the light curves of double-waved\nACVs and the variability induced by orbital motion (ellipsoidal\nvariables/eclipsing variables), especially for objects exhibiting very small\namplitudes and/or significant scatter in their light curves. Thus, some\neclipsing or rotating ellipsoidal variables might be present. However, we are\nconfident that the given periods are the correct ones. There seems to be a\npossible weak correlation between the rotational period and colour, in the\nsense that cooler magnetic CP stars rotate more slowly. However, this\ncorrelation seems to disappear when correcting for the interstellar reddening. \n\n"}

This would explain observed exoplanets with significant inclination\nrespect to the equatorial plane of their host star. We have used two different\nSPH codes, vine and phantom, to model the evolution of a system\nstar+disk+planet and companion star with time. After an initial coupled\nevolution, the inclination of the disk and that of the planet begin to differ\nsignificantly. The period of oscillation of the disk inclination, respect to\nthe initial plane, is shorter than that of the planet which evolves\nindependently after about 10^4 yr following a perturbed N-body behavior.\nHowever, the planet keeps migrating towards the star because during its orbital\nmotion it crosses the disk plane and the friction with the gas causes angular\nmomentum loss. Disk and planet in a significantly inclined binary system are\nnot dynamically coupled for small binary separations but evolve almost\nindependently. The planet abandons the disk and, due to the onset of a\nsignificant mutual inclination, it interacts with the gas only when its orbit\nintersects the disk plane.

After the failure of two reaction wheels, the Kepler satellite\nhas been repurposed as Kepler-2 (K2), observing fields close to the ecliptic\nplane. As these fields contain many more bright stars than the original Kepler\nfield, K2 provides an unprecedented opportunity to study nearby objects\namenable to detailed follow-up with ground-based instruments.

The\nmodel is then applied to the distribution of high equivalent width Lyman\n$\\alpha$ emitters (with rest-frame equivalent widths above 100 A, threshold\nused in e.g. Trainor & Steidel, 2013) identified in a deep narrow-band 36x36\narcmin$^2$ image centered on the luminous quasar Q0420-388. These emitters are\nfound to the edge of the field and show some evidence of an azimuthal asymmetry\non the sky of the type expected if the quasar is radiating in a bipolar cone.\nIf these sources are being fluorescently illuminated by the quasar, the two\nmost distant objects require a lifetime of at least 15 Myr for an opening angle\nof 60 degrees or more, increasing to more than 40 Myr if the opening angle is\nreduced to a minimum 30 degrees.

A minimum level of nuclear activity is thought to be necessary\n--- but not sufficient --- for planets to be habitable. Extending previous work\nthat focused on short-lived nuclei, this paper considers the delivery of\nlong-lived radioactive nuclei to circumstellar disks in star forming regions.\nAlthough the long-lived nuclear species are always present, their abundances\ncan be enhanced through multiple mechanisms. Most stars form in embedded\ncluster environments, so that disks can be enriched directly by intercepting\nejecta from supernovae within the birth clusters. In addition, molecular clouds\noften provide multiple episodes of star formation, so that nuclear abundances\ncan accumulate within the cloud; subsequent generations of stars can thus\nreceive elevated levels of radioactive nuclei through this distributed\nenrichment scenario. This paper calculates the distribution of additional\nenrichment for $^{40}$K, the most abundant of the long-lived radioactive\nnuclei. We find that distributed enrichment is more effective than direct\nenrichment. For the latter mechanism, ideal conditions lead to about 1 in 200\nsolar systems being directly enriched in $^{40}$K at the level inferred for the\nearly solar nebula (thereby doubling the abundance). For distributed enrichment\nfrom adjacent clusters, about 1 in 80 solar systems are enriched at the same\nlevel.

We show that this puzzle is solved if super-Earths\nformed late, as the last vestiges of their parent gas disks were about to\nclear. This scenario would seem to present fine-tuning problems, but we show\nthat there are none. Ambient gas densities can span many (up to 9) orders of\nmagnitude, and super-Earths can still robustly emerge after $\\sim$0.1-1 Myr\nwith percent-by-weight atmospheres. Super-Earth cores are naturally bred in\ngas-poor environments where gas dynamical friction has weakened sufficiently to\nallow constituent protocores to merge. So little gas is present at the time of\ncore assembly that cores hardly migrate by disk torques: formation of\nsuper-Earths can be in situ. The picture --- that close-in super-Earths form in\na gas-poor (but not gas-empty) inner disk, fed continuously by gas that bleeds\ninward from a more massive outer disk --- recalls the largely evacuated but\nstill accreting inner cavities of transitional protoplanetary disks.

This densified pupil spectrometer comprises the following three\nroles: division of a pupil into a number of sub-pupils, densification of each\nsub-pupil, and acquisition of the spectrum of each sub-pupil with a\nconventional spectrometer. Focusing on the fact that the divided and densified\nsub-pupil can be treated as a point source, we discovered that a simplified\nspectrometer allows us to acquire the spectra of the densified sub-pupils on\nthe detector plane-an optical conjugate with the primary mirror-by putting the\ndivided and densified sub-pupils on the entrance slit of the spectrometer.

The\ninferred all-sky burst rate is comparable to the core-collapse supernova rate\nout to redshift 0.5. If the observed dispersion measures are assumed to be\ndominated by the intergalactic medium, the sources are at cosmological\ndistances with redshifts of 0.2 to 1. These parameters are consistent with a\nwide range of source models. One fast radio burst showed circular polarization\n[21(7)%] of the radio emission, but no linear polarization was detected, and\nhence no Faraday rotation measure could be determined.

Here, I provide a light curve of 1338 Johnson B-band\nmagnitudes from 1890 to 1989 taken from archival photographic plates at\nHarvard. KIC8462852 displays a secular dimming at an average rate of\n0.164+-0.013 magnitudes per century. From the early-1890s to the late-1980s,\nKIC8462852 faded by 0.193+-0.030 mag. The decline is not an artifact because\nnearby check stars have closely flat light curves. This century-long dimming is\nunprecedented for any F-type main sequence star. Thus the Harvard light curve\nprovides the first confirmation (past the several dips seen in the Kepler light\ncurve alone) that KIC8462852 has anything unusual. The century-long dimming and\nthe day-long dips are both just extreme ends of a spectrum of timescales for\nunique dimming events. By Ockham's Razor, two such unique and similar effects\nare very likely produced by one physical mechanism. This one mechanism does not\nappear as any isolated catastrophic event in the last century, but rather must\nbe some ongoing process with continuous effects. Within the context of\ndust-occultation models, the century-long dimming trend requires 10^4 to 10^7\ntimes as much dust as for the deepest Kepler dip. Within the context of the\ncomet-family idea, the century-long dimming trend requires an estimated 648,000\ngiant comets (each with 200 km diameter) all orchestrated to pass in front of\nthe star within the last century. \n\n"}

We\ndeveloped temperature-dependent internal structure models of water-rich\nsuper-Earths that include a comprehensive temperature-dependent water equation\nof state.

Previous global climate model\n(GCM) studies have shown that, for slowly-rotating planets, strong convection\nat the substellar point can create optically thick water clouds, increasing the\nplanetary albedo, and thus stabilizing the climate against a thermal runaway.\nHowever these studies did not use self-consistent orbital/rotational periods\nfor synchronously rotating planets placed at different distances from the host\nstar. Here we provide new estimates of the inner edge of the habitable zone for\nsynchronously rotating terrestrial planets around late-K and M-dwarf stars\nusing a 3-D Earth-analog GCM with self-consistent relationships between stellar\nmetallicity, stellar effective temperature, and the planetary\norbital/rotational period. We find that both atmospheric dynamics and the\nefficacy of the substellar cloud deck are sensitive to the precise rotation\nrate of the planet. Around mid-to-late M-dwarf stars with low metallicity,\nplanetary rotation rates at the inner edge of the HZ become faster, and the\ninner edge of the habitable zone is farther away from the host stars than in\nprevious GCM studies. For an Earth-sized planet, the dynamical regime of the\nsubstellar clouds begins to transition as the rotation rate approaches ~10\ndays. These faster rotation rates produce stronger zonal winds that encircle\nthe planet and smear the substellar clouds around it, lowering the planetary\nalbedo, and causing the onset of the water-vapor greenhouse climatic\ninstability to occur at up to ~25% lower incident stellar fluxes than found in\nprevious GCM studies. For mid-to-late M-dwarf stars with high metallicity and\nfor mid-K to early-M stars, we agree with previous studies. \n\n"}

Among the data processing techniques for angular differential imaging\n(ADI), the most recent is the family of principal component analysis (PCA)\nbased algorithms. PCA serves, in this case, as a subspace projection technique\nfor constructing a reference point spread function (PSF) that can be subtracted\nfrom the science data for boosting the detectability of potential companions\npresent in the data. Unfortunately, when building this reference PSF from the\nscience data itself, PCA comes with certain limitations such as the sensitivity\nof the lower dimensional orthogonal subspace to non-Gaussian noise. Inspired by\nrecent advances in machine learning algorithms such as robust PCA, we aim to\npropose a localized subspace projection technique that surpasses current\nPCA-based post-processing algorithms in terms of the detectability of\ncompanions at near real-time speed, a quality that will be useful for future\ndirect imaging surveys. We used randomized low-rank approximation methods\nrecently proposed in the machine learning literature, coupled with entry-wise\nthresholding to decompose an ADI image sequence locally into low-rank, sparse,\nand Gaussian noise components (LLSG). This local three-term decomposition\nseparates the starlight and the associated speckle noise from the planetary\nsignal, which mostly remains in the sparse term.

We simulate systems configured\nwith semi-major axes of either $a=62$~AU (`wide') or $a=32$~AU (`close'), and\nwith eccentricity of either $e=0$ or $e=0.3$. Strong spiral structures are\ngenerated with large material streams extending inwards. A small fraction\naccretes onto the circumstellar disks, with most returning to the torus.\nStructures also propagate outwards, generating net outwards mass flow and\neventually losing coherence at large distances. The torus becomes significantly\neccentric in shape. Accretion onto the stars occurs at a rate of a few\n$\\times10^{-8}$\\msun/yr implying disk lifetimes shorter than $\\sim10^4$~yr,\nwithout replenishment. Only wide configurations retain disks by virtue of\nrobust accretion. In eccentric configurations, accretion is episodic, occurs\npreferentially onto the secondary at wrates peaked near binary periapse. We\nconclude that the \\ggtaua\\ torus is strongly self gravitating and that a major\ncontribution to its thermal energy is shock dissipation. We interpret its\nobserved features as manifestations of spiral structures and the low density\nmaterial surrounding it as an excretion disk created by outward mass flux. We\ninterpret GG Tau A as a coplanar system with an eccentric torus, and account\nfor its supposed mutual inclination as due to degeneracy between the\ninterpretation of inclination and eccentricity. Although the disks persist for\nlong enough to permit planet formation, the environment remains unfavorable due\nto high temperatures. We conclude that the GG Tau A system is in an eccentric,\n$a\\sim62$~AU orbit. \n\n"}

In this article, we\ninvestigate the classification of stars into spectral types using only the\nshape of their diffraction pattern in a single broad-band image. We propose a\nsupervised machine learning approach to this endeavour, based on principal\ncomponent analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, followed by artificial\nneural networks (ANNs) estimating the spectral type. Our analysis is performed\nwith image simulations mimicking the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced\nCamera for Surveys (ACS) in the F606W and F814W bands, as well as the Euclid\nVIS imager. We first demonstrate this classification in a simple context,\nassuming perfect knowledge of the point spread function (PSF) model and the\npossibility of accurately generating mock training data for the machine\nlearning. We then analyse its performance in a fully data-driven situation, in\nwhich the training would be performed with a limited subset of bright stars\nfrom a survey, and an unknown PSF with spatial variations across the detector.\nWe use simulations of main-sequence stars with flat distributions in spectral\ntype and in signal-to-noise ratio, and classify these stars into 13 spectral\nsubclasses, from O5 to M5. Under these conditions, the algorithm achieves a\nhigh success rate both for Euclid and HST images, with typical errors of half a\nspectral class.

Spectroscopic redshifts are only available for a\nvery limited number of objects but can be used for creating statistical models.\nA broad variety of photometric catalogues provide uncertain low resolution\nspectral information for galaxies and quasars that can be used to infer a\nredshift. Many different techniques have been developed to produce those\nredshift estimates with increasing precision. Instead of providing a point\nestimate only, astronomers start to generate probabilistic density functions\n(PDFs) which should provide a characterisation of the uncertainties of the\nestimation. In this work we present two simple approaches on how to generate\nthose PDFs. We use the example of generating the photometric redshift PDFs of\nquasars from SDSS(DR7) to validate our approaches and to compare them with\npoint estimates. We do not aim for presenting a new best performing method, but\nwe choose an intuitive approach that is based on well known machine learning\nalgorithms. Furthermore we introduce proper tools for evaluating the\nperformance of PDFs in the context of astronomy. The continuous ranked\nprobability score (CRPS) and the probability integral transform (PIT) are well\naccepted in the weather forecasting community. Both tools reflect how well the\nPDFs reproduce the real values of the analysed objects.

On the other hand, the existence of pressure maxima in\nthe disk could act as migration traps and locations for solid material\naccumulation, favoring the formation of massive cores. We aim to study the\nradial drift of pebbles and planetesimals and planet migration at pressure\nmaxima in a protoplanetary disk and their implications for the formation of\nmassive cores as triggering a gaseous runaway accretion phase. The time\nevolution of a viscosity driven accretion disk is solved numerically\nintroducing a a dead zone as a low-viscosity region in the protoplanetary disk.\nA population of pebbles and planetesimals evolving by radial drift and\naccretion by the planets is also considered. Finally, the embryos embedded in\nthe disk grow by the simultaneous accretion of pebbles, planetesimals and the\nsurrounding gas. Our simulations show that the pressure maxima generated at the\nedges of the low-viscosity region of the disk act as planet migration traps,\nand that the pebble and planetesimal surface densities are significantly\nincreased due to the radial drift towards pressure maxima locations. However,\nour simulations also show that migration trap locations and solid material\naccumulation locations are not exactly at the same positions. Thus, a planet's\nsemi-major axis oscillations around zero torque locations, predicted by MHD and\nHD simulations, are needed for the planet to accrete all the available material\naccumulated at the pressure maxima.

The broad wavelength coverage and high sensitivity of its\ninstruments will allow us to extract far more information from exoplanet\nspectra than what has been possible with current observations. In this paper,\nwe investigate whether current retrieval methods will still be valid in the era\nof JWST, exploring common approximations used when retrieving transmission\nspectra of hot Jupiters. To assess biases, we use 1D photochemical models to\nsimulate typical hot Jupiter cloud-free atmospheres and generate synthetic\nobservations for a range of carbon-to-oxygen ratios. Then, we retrieve these\nspectra using TauREx, a Bayesian retrieval tool, using two methodologies: one\nassuming an isothermal atmosphere, and one assuming a parametrized temperature\nprofile. Both methods assume constant-with-altitude abundances. We found that\nthe isothermal approximation biases the retrieved parameters considerably,\noverestimating the abundances by about one order of magnitude. The retrieved\nabundances using the parametrized profile are usually within one sigma of the\ntrue state, and we found the retrieved uncertainties to be generally larger\ncompared to the isothermal approximation. Interestingly, we found that using\nthe parametrized temperature profile we could place tight constraints on the\ntemperature structure.

This correlation suggests that HJ formation is affected by the\nstellar binary companion. A potential model is high-eccentricity migration, in\nwhich the binary companion induces high-eccentricity Lidov-Kozai (LK)\noscillations in the proto-HJ orbit, triggering orbital migration driven by\ntides. A pitfall of this `binary-LK' model is that the observed stellar\nbinaries hosting HJs are typically too wide to produce HJs in sufficient\nnumbers, because of suppression by short-range forces. We propose a\nmodification to the binary-LK model in which there is a second giant planet\norbiting the proto-HJ at a semimajor axis of several tens of AU. Such\ncompanions are currently hidden to observations, but their presence could be\nmanifested by a propagation of the perturbation of the stellar binary companion\ninwards to the proto-HJ, thereby overcoming the barrier imposed by short-range\nforces. Our model does not require the planetary companion orbit to be\neccentric and/or inclined with respect to the proto-HJ, but its semimajor axis\nshould lie in a specific range given the planetary mass and binary semimajor\naxis, and the inclination with respect to the binary should be near $40^\\circ$\nor $140^\\circ$.

The first one is that\nSPH requires that the density is continuous and differentiable. The second one\nis that SPH does not have the consistency, and thus the accuracy is zeroth\norder in space. In addition, we cannot express accurate boundary conditions\nwith SPH. In this paper, we propose a novel, high-order scheme for\nparticle-based hydrodynamics of compress- ible fluid.

We illustrate\nthat a stable equilibrium of the averaged system (a periodic orbit of the\nN-body model) is surrounded by the region of permanent resonance capture, whose\nsize depends on the migration parameters and the planets mass ratio. A system\nlocated inside this region tends towards the equilibrium (the capture is\npermanent), while a system located outside the region evolves away from the\nequilibrium and leaves the resonance. We verify recent results of Delisle et\nal. and Xu & Lai where they show that for $m_1 \\lesssim m_2$ ($m_1, m_2$ are\nthe inner and outer planets' masses) the equilibrium is unstable when the\nmigration is added, so the capture cannot be permanent.

The ram pressure exerted\nby the flow can truncate the disc and the accretion of material with no\nazimuthal angular momentum leads to further disc contraction. We derive a\ntheoretical model from accretion disc theory that describes the evolution of\nthe disc radius, mass, and surface density profile as a function of the density\nand velocity of the ambient medium. We test our model by performing\nhydrodynamical simulations of a protoplanetary disc embedded in a flow with\ndifferent velocities and densities. We find that our model gives an adequate\ndescription of the evolution of the disc radius and accretion rate onto the\ndisc. The total disc mass in the simulations follows the theoretically expected\ntrend, except at the lowest density where our simulated discs lose mass owing\nto continuous stripping. This stripping may be a numerical rather than a\nphysical effect. Some quantitative differences exist between the model\npredictions and the simulations.

Algorithms like the Trend Filtering\nAlgorithm (TFA) use simultaneously-observed stars to remove systematic effects,\nand binning is used to reduce high-frequency random noise. We present TFAW, a\nwavelet-based modified version of TFA. TFAW aims to increase the periodic\nsignal detection and to return a detrended and denoised signal without\nmodifying its intrinsic characteristics. We modify TFA's frequency analysis\nstep adding a Stationary Wavelet Transform filter to perform an initial noise\nand outlier removal and increase the detection of variable signals. A wavelet\nfilter is added to TFA's signal reconstruction to perform an adaptive\ncharacterization of the noise- and trend-free signal and the noise contribution\nat each iteration while preserving astrophysical signals. We carried out tests\nover simulated sinusoidal and transit-like signals to assess the effectiveness\nof the method and applied TFAW to real light curves from TFRM. We also studied\nTFAW's application to simulated multiperiodic signals, improving their\ncharacterization. TFAW improves the signal detection rate by increasing the\nsignal detection efficiency (SDE) up to a factor ~2.5x for low SNR light\ncurves. For simulated transits, the transit detection rate improves by a factor\n~2-5x in the low-SNR regime compared to TFA. TFAW signal approximation performs\nup to a factor ~2x better than bin averaging for planetary transits. The\nstandard deviations of simulated and real TFAW light curves are ~40x better\nthan TFA. TFAW yields better MCMC posterior distributions and returns lower\nuncertainties, less biased transit parameters and narrower (~10x) credibility\nintervals for simulated transits.

We have primarily studied two classes of instrumental\nconfigurations: arrays of large aperture telescopes with diameters ranging from\n2-10 m, and hybrid arrays that combine small-aperture telescopes (0.5 m\ndiameter) with large-aperture telescopes. We explore performance as a function\nof the telescope aperture size, the distribution of the detectors into\ndifferent microwave frequencies, the survey strategy and survey area, the\nlow-frequency noise performance, and the balance between small and large\naperture telescopes for the hybrid configurations. We also examine the impact\nfrom the uncertainties of the instrumental model. There are several areas that\ndeserve further improvement.

However,\ncurrent and planned space missions and ground-based extremely large telescopes\npresent complex pupil geometries, including secondary mirror central\nobscurations, that prevent vortex coronagraphs from rejecting on-axis sources\nentirely. Recent solutions combining the vortex phase mask with a ring-apodized\npupil have been proposed to circumvent this issue, but provide a limited\nthroughput for vortex charges $>2$. We present a family of pupil plane\napodizations that compensate for pupil geometries with circularly symmetric\ncentral obstructions caused by on-axis secondary mirrors for charge 2, 4, and 6\nvector vortex coronagraphs. These apodizations are derived analytically and\nallow the vortex coronagraph to retain theoretically perfect nulling in the\npresence of central obscurations. For a charge 4 vortex, we design polynomial\napodization functions assuming a greyscale apodizing filter that represent a\nsubstantial gain in throughput over the ring-apodized vortex coronagraph\ndesign, while for a charge 6 vortex, we design polynomial apodized vortex\ncoronagraphs that have $\\gtrsim 70\\%$ total energy throughput for the entire\nrange of central obscuration sizes studied.

The aim is to establish whether SAMs are able to show galactic\nconformity using different models and selection criteria. In all the models,\nwhen the selection of primary galaxies is based on an isolation criterion in\nreal space, the mean fraction of quenched galaxies around quenched primary\ngalaxies is higher than that around star-forming primary galaxies of the same\nstellar mass. The overall signal of conformity decreases when we remove\nsatellites selected as primary galaxies, but the effect is much stronger in\nGALFORM models compared with the L-GALAXIES model. We find this difference is\npartially explained by the fact that in GALFORM once a galaxy becomes a\nsatellite remains as such, whereas satellites can become centrals at a later\ntime in L-GALAXIES. The signal of conformity decreases down to 60% in the\nL-GALAXIES model after removing central galaxies that were ejected from their\nhost halo in the past.

The simulation is initialized with a\nnon-axisymmetric non-force-free magnetic field that best correlates with the\nobserved vector magnetograms of solar active regions (ARs). To focus on these\nideas, simulations are performed for the flaring AR 11283 noted for its\ncomplexity and well-documented dynamics. The simulated dynamics develops as the\ninitial Lorentz force pushes the plasma and facilitates successive magnetic\nreconnections at the two X-type null lines present in the initial field.\nImportantly, the simulation allows for the spontaneous development of mass\nflow, unique among contemporary works, that preferentially reconnects field\nlines at one of the X-type null lines. Consequently, a flux rope consisting of\nlow-lying twisted MFLs, which approximately traces the major polarity inversion\nline, undergoes an asymmetric monotonic rise. The rise is attributed to a\nreduction in the magnetic tension force at the region overlying the rope,\nresulting from the reconnection.

Our\nspectra cover a wavelength range between 5200 and 10200 angstroms. We find that\nthe color of AU Mic's debris disk is bluest at small (12-35 AU) projected\nseparations. These results both confirm and quantify the findings qualitatively\nnoted by Krist et al.

Unlike previous literature that reported the color of\nAU Mic's disk became increasingly more blue as a function of projected\nseparation beyond approximately 30 AU, we find the disk's optical color between\n35-45 AU to be uniformly blue on the southeast side of the disk and\ndecreasingly blue on the northwest side. We note that this apparent change in\ndisk color at larger projected separations coincides with several fast, outward\nmoving \"features\" that are passing through this region of the southeast side of\nthe disk. We speculate that these phenomenon might be related, and that the\nfast moving features could be changing the localized distribution of sub-micron\nsized grains as they pass by, thereby reducing the blue color of the disk in\nthe process. We encourage follow-up optical spectroscopic observations of the\nAU Mic to both confirm this result, and search for further modifications of the\ndisk color caused by additional fast moving features propagating through the\ndisk. \n\n"}

These simulations also suggest\nthat some TNOs transition between several different mean-motion resonances\nduring their lifetimes while still retaining approximate apsidal anti-alignment\nwith Planet Nine. This behavior suggests that remaining in one particular orbit\nis not a requirement for orbital stability. As one product of our simulations,\nwe present an {\\it a posteriori} probability distribution for the semi-major\naxis and eccentricity of the proposed Planet Nine based on TNO stability. This\nresult thus provides additional evidence that supports the existence of this\nproposed planet.

The clouds are produced by avalanches:\nradial outflows of dust that gain exponentially more mass as they shatter\nbackground disk particles in collisional chain reactions. The avalanches are\ntriggered from a region a few AU across -- the \"avalanche zone\" -- located on\nAU Mic's primary \"birth\" ring, at a true distance of $\\sim$35 AU from the star\nbut at a projected distance more than a factor of 10 smaller: the avalanche\nzone sits directly along the line of sight to the star, on the side of the ring\nnearest Earth, launching clouds that disk rotation sends wholly to the\nsoutheast, as observed. The avalanche zone marks where the primary ring\nintersects a secondary ring of debris left by the catastrophic disruption of a\nprogenitor up to Varuna in size, less than tens of thousands of years ago.

However there remains a lack of\nconsensus on the physical mechanism(s) responsible for initiating it. One\npotential avenue is disc photoevaporation, wherein the preferential removal of\nrelatively dust-free gas increases the disc metallicity. Late in the disc\nlifetime, photoevaporation dominates viscous accretion, creating a gradient in\nthe depleted gas surface density near the location of the gap. This induces a\nlocal pressure maximum that collects drifting dust particles, which may then\nbecome susceptible to the streaming instability. Using a one-dimensional\nviscous evolution model of a disc subject to internal X-ray photoevaporation,\nwe explore the efficacy of this process to build planetestimals. Over a range\nof parameters we find that the amount of dust mass converted into planetesimals\nis often < 1 M_Earth and at most a few M_Earth spread across tens of AU. We\nconclude that photoevaporation may at best be relevant for the formation of\ndebris discs, rather than a common mechanism for the formation of planetary\ncores. Our results are in contrast to a recent, similar investigation that\nconsidered an FUV-driven photoevaporation model and reported the formation of\ntens of M_Earth at large (> 100 AU) disc radii. The discrepancies are primarily\na consequence of the different photoevaporation profiles assumed. Until\nobservations more tightly constrain photoevaporation models, the relevance of\nthis process to the formation of planets remains uncertain. \n\n"}

In the first\ncase, we run MCMC sampling on the compressed data-vector in order to recover\nthe one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) posterior distributions. The\nsecond option, approximately 2000 times faster, works by orthogonalising the\nparameter space through diagonalisation of the Fisher information matrix before\nthe compression, obtaining the posterior distributions without the need of MCMC\nsampling.

The chemical composition of this material is usually assumed to be\nunchanged during the disk lifetime. However, chemistry can alter the relative\nabundances of molecules in this planet-building material. To assess the impact\nof disk chemistry during the era of planet formation, an extensive kinetic\nchemistry gas-grain reaction network is utilised to evolve the abundances of\nchemical species over time. Given a high level of ionisation, chemical\nevolution in protoplanetary disk midplanes becomes significant after a few\ntimes $10^{5}$ yrs, and is still ongoing by 7 Myr between the H$_{2}$O and the\nO$_{2}$ icelines. Importantly, the changes in the abundances of the major\nelemental carbon and oxygen-bearing molecules imply that the traditional\n\"stepfunction\" for the C/O ratios in gas and ice in the disk midplane (as\ndefined by sharp changes at icelines of H$_{2}$O, CO$_{2}$ and CO) evolves over\ntime, and cannot be assumed fixed. In addition, at lower temperatures (< 29 K),\ngaseous CO colliding with the grains gets converted into CO$_{2}$ and other\nmore complex ices, lowering the CO gas abundance between the O$_{2}$ and CO\nthermal icelines. This effect can mimic a CO iceline at a higher temperature\nthan suggested by its binding energy. Chemistry in the disk midplane is\nionisation-driven, and evolves over time. In order to reliably predict the\natmospheric compositions of forming planets, as well as to relate observed\natmospheric C/O ratios of exoplanets to where and how the atmospheres have\nformed in a disk midplane, chemical evolution needs to be considered and\nimplemented into planet formation models. \n\n"}

It works by detecting the velocity of a host star induced\nby the gravitational effect of an orbiting planet, specifically the velocity\nalong our line of sight, which is called the radial velocity of the star.\nLow-mass planets typically cause their host star to move with radial velocities\nof 1 m/s or less. By analyzing a time series of stellar spectra from a host\nstar, modern astronomical instruments can in theory detect such planets.\nHowever, in practice, intrinsic stellar variability (e.g., star spots,\nconvective motion, pulsations) affects the spectra and often mimics a radial\nvelocity signal. This signal contamination makes it difficult to reliably\ndetect low-mass planets. A principled approach to recovering planet radial\nvelocity signals in the presence of stellar activity was proposed by Rajpaul et\nal. (2015). It uses a multivariate Gaussian process model to jointly capture\ntime series of the apparent radial velocity and multiple indicators of stellar\nactivity. We build on this work in two ways: (i) we propose using dimension\nreduction techniques to construct new high-information stellar activity\nindicators; and (ii) we extend the Rajpaul et al. (2015) model to a larger\nclass of models and use a power-based model comparison procedure to select the\nbest model. Despite significant interest in exoplanets, previous efforts have\nnot performed large-scale stellar activity model selection or attempted to\nevaluate models based on planet detection power.

Very long\nbaseline interferometry (VLBI) enables high-resolution imaging on\nmilli-arcsecond (mas) and sub-mas scales, making it a powerful tool to explore\nthe inner jet structure, shedding light on the formation, acceleration and\ncollimation of AGN jets.

In contrast to absorption in the\nEarth's atmosphere (telluric absorption), the planet transmission spectrum\nshifts in radial velocity during transit due to the changing orbital motion of\nthe planet. This allows us to remove the telluric spectrum while preserving the\nsignal of the exoplanet.

Our purpose is to\nstudy the properties of the diffuse Galactic polarized synchrotron as a\ncontaminant to CMB B-mode observations. We study the angular distribution of\nthe S-PASS signal at intermediate and high Galactic latitudes by means of\nangular power spectra. Power spectra, show a decay of the spectral amplitude as\na function of multipole for \\ell<200, typical of the diffuse emission. Spectra\ncan be approximated by a power law C_{\\ell}\\propto\\ell^{alpha}, with alpha~-3,\nand characterized by a B-to-E ratio of ~0.5. We study the synchrotron SED in\npolarization by computing power spectra of the low frequency WMAP and Planck\nmaps. Results show that the SED, in the frequency range 2.3-33 GHz, is\ncompatible with a power law with beta_s=-3.22\\pm0.08. Combining S-PASS\npolarization maps with those coming from WMAP and Planck we derived a map of\nthe synchrotron spectral index at angular resolution of 2{\\deg} on about 30% of\nthe sky. The recovered distribution peaks at the value around -3.2. We also\nmeasure a significant spatial correlation between synchrotron and thermal dust\nsignals, as traced by the Planck 353 GHz channel. This correlation reaches\nabout 40% on the larger angular scales, decaying considerably at the degree\nscales. Finally, we use the S-PASS maps to assess the polarized synchrotron\ncontamination to CMB observations of the B-modes. Moreover, by combining S-PASS\ndata with Planck 353 GHz observations, we recover a map of the minimum level of\ntotal polarized foreground contamination to B-modes, finding that there is no\nregion of the sky, at any frequency, where this contamination lies below\nequivalent tenor-to-scalar ratio ~10^-3.

The\nobservations are simultaneously observed with the Jansky Very Large Array at\ntheir P-band (230-470 MHz) and at the Apache Point observatory in the SDSS u'\nfilter ($\\lambda$ = 3557 \\AA).

Combined with additional Angular\nDifferential Imaging observations we aim at a fine characterization of the\ndebris disk and setting constraints on the presence of low-mass planets. We\nmodel the SPHERE DPI observations and constrain the location of the small dust\ngrains, as well as the spectral energy distribution of the debris disk, using\nthe results inferred from the observations, and perform simple N-body\nsimulations. We find that the dust density distribution peaks at 25 au, with a\nvery shallow outer power-law slope, and that the disk has an inclination of 13\ndegrees with a position angle of 90 degrees East of North. We also report low\nsignal-to-noise detections of an outer belt at a distance of ~52 au from the\nstar, of a spiral arm in the Southern side of the star, and of a possible dusty\nclump at 3.9 au. These findings seem to persist over timescales of at least a\nyear. Using the intensity images, we do not detect any planets in the close\nvicinity of the star, but the sensitivity reaches Jovian planet mass upper\nlimits. We find that the SED is best reproduced with an inner disk at 7 au and\nanother belt at 25 au. We report the detections of several unexpected features\nin the disk around TWA\\,7. A yet undetected 100 M$_\\oplus$ planet with a\nsemi-major axis at 20-30 au could possibly explain the outer belt as well as\nthe spiral arm. We conclude that stellar winds are unlikely to be responsible\nfor the spiral arm. \n\n"}

High-contrast exoplanet imaging is a rapidly growing field as can be\nseen through the significant resources invested. In fact, the detection and\ncharacterization of exoplanets through direct imaging is featured at all major\nground-based observatories. Aims. We aim to improve the signal-to-noise ratio\n(SNR) achievable for ground-based, adaptive-optics assisted exoplanet imaging\nby applying sophisticated post-processing algorithms. In particular, we\ninvestigate the benefits of including time domain information. Methods. We\nintroduce a new speckle-suppression technique in data post-processing based on\nwavelet transformation. This technique explicitly considers the time domain in\na given data set (specifically the frequencies of speckle variations and their\ntime dependence) and allows us to filter-out speckle noise. We combine our\nwavelet-based algorithm with state-of-the-art principal component analysis\n(PCA) based PSF subtraction routines and apply it to archival data sets of\nknown directly imaged exoplanets. The data sets were obtained in the L filter\nwhere the short integration times allow for a sufficiently high temporal\nsampling of the speckle variations. Results. We demonstrate that improvements\nin the peak SNR of up to forty to sixty percent can be achieved. We also show\nthat, when combined with wavelet-denoising, the PCA PSF model requires\nsystematically smaller numbers of components for the fit to achieve the highest\nSNR. The improvement potential is, however, data set dependent or, more\nspecifically, closely linked to the field rotation available in a given data\nset: larger amounts of rotation allow for a better suppression of the speckle\nnoise.

To date, simulation softwares have been\ndeveloped by individual researchers or research groups in each field, with a\nhuge amount of time and effort, even though numerical algorithms used are very\nsimilar. To improve the situation, we have developed a framework, called FDPS,\nwhich enables researchers to easily develop massively parallel particle\nsimulation codes for arbitrary particle methods. Until version 3.0, FDPS have\nprovided API only for C++ programing language. This limitation comes from the\nfact that FDPS is developed using the template feature in C++, which is\nessential to support arbitrary data types of particle. However, there are many\nresearchers who use Fortran to develop their codes. Thus, the previous versions\nof FDPS require such people to invest much time to learn C++. This is\ninefficient. To cope with this problem, we newly developed a Fortran interface\nlayer in FDPS, which provides API for Fortran. In order to support arbitrary\ndata types of particle in Fortran, we design the Fortran interface layer as\nfollows. Based on a given derived data type in Fortran representing particle, a\nPython script provided by us automatically generates a library that manipulates\nthe C++ core part of FDPS.

We aim to clarify whether the exomoon-like\nsignal is really caused by a large object in orbit around Kepler-1625b. We\nexplore several detrending procedures, i.e. polynomials and the Cosine\nFiltering with Autocorrelation Minimization (CoFiAM). We then supply a light\ncurve simulator with the co-planar orbital dynamics of the system and fit the\nresulting planet-moon transit light curves to the Kepler data. We employ the\nBayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to assess whether a single planet or a\nplanet-moon system is a more likely interpretation of the light curve\nvariations. We carry out a blind hare-and-hounds exercise using many noise\nrealizations by injecting simulated transits into different out-of-transit\nparts of the original Kepler-1625 data: 100 sequences with 3 synthetic transits\nof a Kepler-1625b-like planet and 100 sequences with 3 synthetic transits of\nthis planet with a Neptune-sized moon. The statistical significance and\ncharacteristics of the exomoon-like signal strongly depend on the detrending\nmethod, and the data chosen for detrending, and on the treatment of gaps in the\nlight curve. Our injection-retrieval experiment shows evidence for moons in\nabout 10% of those light curves that do not contain an injected moon.\nStrikingly, many of these false-positive moons resemble the exomoon candidate.\nWe recover up to about half of the injected moons, depending on the detrending\nmethod, with radii and orbital distances broadly corresponding to the injected\nvalues. A $\\Delta$BIC of -4.9 for the CoFiAM-based detrending indicates an\nexomoon around Kepler-1625b.

Its main goal is to complete\ntheir TTV curves, as the Kepler telescope no longer observes the original\nKepler field. Combining Kepler and new ground-based transit data we improve the\nmodelling of these systems. To this end, we have developed a photodynamical\nmodel, and we demonstrate its performance using the Kepler-9 system as an\nexample. Our comprehensive analysis combines the numerical integration of the\nsystem's dynamics over the time span of the observations along with the transit\nlight curve model. This model is coupled with a Markov chain Monte Carlo\nalgorithm, allowing the exploration of the model parameter space. Applied to\nthe Kepler-9 long cadence data, short cadence data and 13 new transit\nobservations collected by KOINet between the years 2014 to 2017, our modelling\nprovides well constrained predictions for the next transits and the system's\nparameters.

Our analysis reveals that Kepler-9c will stop transiting in about\n30 years. This results from strong dynamical interactions between Kepler-9b and\n9c, near 2:1 resonance, that leads to a periodic change in inclination. Over\nthe next 30 years the inclination of Kepler-9c (-9b) will decrease (increase)\nslowly. This should be measurable by a substantial decrease (increase) in the\ntransit duration, in as soon as a few years' time. Observations that contradict\nthis prediction might indicate the presence of additional objects.

Using data from the GMRT we show\nthat post-correlation beamformation results in a many-folds increase in the\nsignal-to-noise for periodic signals from pulsars and several order of\nmagnitude reduction in the number of false triggers from single pulse events\nlike fast radio bursts (FRBs). This difference arises primarily because the\npost-correlation beam contains less red-noise, as well as less radio frequency\ninterference. The post-correlation beam can also be more easily calibrated than\nthe incoherent or phased array beams. We also discuss two different modes of\npost-correlation beamformation, viz. (1) by subtracting the incoherent beam\nfrom the coherent beam and (2) by phased addition of the visibilities. The\ncomputational costs for both these beamformation techniques as well as their\nsuitability for studies of pulsars and FRBs are discussed.

Across the 0.47-1 micron wavelength\nrange, the data imply an atmospheric opacity comparable to - and in some\nspectroscopic channels exceeding - that previously measured at near-infrared\nwavelengths (1.15-1.65 micron). Wavelength-dependent variations in the opacity\nrule out a gray cloud deck at a confidence level of 3.8-sigma and may instead\nbe explained by VO spectral bands.

Using a free-chemistry retrieval analysis, we estimate\na VO abundance of -6.6(-0.3,+0.2) dex.

We performed a series of N-body simulations of high-density and\nlow-density open clusters, open clusters that grow via mergers of subclusters,\nand embedded clusters. We semi-analytically calculated the survival rate of\nplanets in star clusters up to 1Gyr using relative velocities, masses, and\nimpact parameters of intruding stars. Less than 1.5% of close-in planets within\n1 AU and at most 7% of planets with 1-10 AU are ejected by stellar encounters\nin clustered environments after the dynamical evolution of star clusters. If a\nplanet population from 0.01-100 AU in an open cluster initially follows the\nprobability distribution function of exoplanets with semi-major axis ($a_p$)\nbetween 0.03-3 AU in the field discovered by RV surveys, the PDF of surviving\nplanets beyond ~10 AU in open clusters can be slightly modified to $\\propto\na_p^{-0.76}$. The production rate of free-floating planets (FFPs) per star is\n0.0096-0.18, where we have assumed that all the stars initially have one giant\nplanet with a mass of 1--13 MJ in a circular orbit. The expected frequency of\nFFPs is compatible with the upper limit on that of FFPs indicated by recent\nmicrolensing surveys. Our survival rates of planets in open clusters suggest\nthat planets within 10 AU around FGKM-type stars are rich in relatively-young\n(<~10-100 Myr for open clusters and ~1-10 Myr for embedded clusters), less\nmassive open clusters, which are promising targets for planet searches. \n\n"}

We consider the capabilities of this\ninstrument in the case where one band is centered on an oxygen-free continuum\nregion while the other band overlaps the 760 nm oxygen band head in the\ntransmission spectrum of the exoplanet, which can be accessible from Earth in\nsystems with large negative line-of-sight velocities. We find that M9 and M4\ndwarfs that meet this radial velocity requirement will be the easiest targets\nbut must be nearby (<8 pc) and will require the largest upcoming Extremely\nLarge Telescopes. The oxyometer instrument design is simple and versatile and\ncould be adapted to enable the study of a wide range of atmospheric species. We\ndemonstrate this by building a prototype oxyometer and present its design and a\ndetection of a 50 ppm simulated transit signal in the laboratory. We also\npresent data from an on-sky test of a prototype oxyometer, demonstrating the\nease of use of the compact instrument design. \n\n"}

It is the first optical\ninterferometer capable of observing sources as faint as magnitude 19 in K-band.\nThis is possible thanks to the fringe tracker which compensates the\ndifferential piston based on measurements of a brighter off-axis astronomical\nreference source. The goal of this paper is to consign the main developments\nmade in the context of the GRAVITY fringe tracker. This could serve as basis\nfor future fringe tracking systems. The paper therefore covers all aspects of\nthe fringe tracker, from hardware, to control software and on-sky observations.\nSpecial emphasis is placed on the interaction between the group delay\ncontroller and the phase delay controller. The group delay control loop is a\nsimple but robust integrator. The phase delay controller is a state-space\ncontrol loop based on an auto-regressive representation of the atmospheric and\nvibrational perturbations.

The unWISE Catalog has two advantages over the existing WISE\ncatalog (AllWISE): first, it is based on significantly deeper imaging, and\nsecond, it features improved modeling of crowded regions. The deeper imaging\nused in the unWISE Catalog comes from the coaddition of all publicly available\n3$-$5 micron WISE imaging, including that from the ongoing NEOWISE-Reactivation\nmission, thereby increasing the total exposure time by a factor of 5 relative\nto AllWISE. At these depths, even at high Galactic latitudes many sources are\nblended with their neighbors; accordingly, the unWISE analysis simultaneously\nfits thousands of sources to obtain accurate photometry. Our new catalog\ndetects sources at 5-sigma roughly 0.7 magnitudes fainter than the AllWISE\ncatalog and more accurately models millions of faint sources in the Galactic\nplane, enabling a wealth of Galactic and extragalactic science.

Both shallow and deep active regions\ndemonstrate a clear dominance of one sign of current helicity in a given\nhemisphere during the whole cycle.

Our simulations have yielded a\nnew model for quasar lifetimes where the lifetime depends on both the\ninstantaneous and peak quasar luminosities. This motivates a new interpretation\nof the QLF in which the bright end consists of quasars radiating at nearly\ntheir peak luminosities, but the faint end is mostly made up of quasars in less\nluminous phases of evolution. The faint-end QLF slope is then determined by the\nfaint-end slope of the quasar lifetime for quasars with peak luminosities near\nthe observed break. We determine this slope from the quasar lifetime as a\nfunction of peak luminosity, based on a large set of simulations spanning a\nwide variety of host galaxy, merger, BH, and ISM gas properties. Brighter peak\nluminosity (higher BH mass) systems undergo more violent evolution, and expel\nand heat gas more rapidly in the final stages of quasar evolution, resulting in\na flatter faint-end slope (as these objects fall below the observed break in\nthe QLF more rapidly). Therefore, as the QLF break luminosity moves to higher\nluminosities with increasing redshift, implying a larger typical quasar peak\nluminosity, the faint-end QLF slope flattens. From the quasar lifetime as a\nfunction of peak luminosity and this interpretation of the QLF, we predict the\nfaint-end QLF slope and its evolution with redshift in good agreement with\nobservations. Although BHs grow anti-hierarchically (with lower-mass BHs formed\nprimarily at lower redshifts), the observed change in slope and differential or\nluminosity dependent density evolution in the QLF is completely determined by\nthe luminosity-dependent quasar lifetime and physics of quasar feedback. \n\n"}

In\nparticular, the results obtained for the nearest BAL IR QSO Mrk 231 are\npresented. Very deep three-dimensional spectra and maps clearly show that the\nBAL systems I and II are extended (reaching 1.4-1.6\" = 1.2-1.3 kpc, from the\nnucleus) and clearly elongated at the position angle close to the radio jet PA.\nWhich suggest that the BAL systems I and II are both associated with the radio\njet, and supporting the bipolar jet-wind model for some BALs. For the nuclear\nregion of Mrk 231, the QSO and host-galaxy components were modelled, using a\nnew technique of decoupling 3D spectra. From this study, the following main\nresults were found: (i) in the pure host galaxy spectrum an extreme nuclear\nstarburst component was clearly observed, mainly as a very strong increase in\nthe flux, at the blue wavelengths; (ii) the BAL system I is observed in the\nspectrum of the host galaxy; (iii) in the clean/pure QSO emission spectrum,\nonly broad lines were detected. 3D GMOS individual spectra (specially in the IR\nCa II triplet) and maps confirm the presence of an extreme and young nuclear\nstarburst (8 < age < 15 Myr), which was detected mainly in a ring or toroid\nwith a radius r = 0.3\" = 200 pc, around the very nucleus. The physical\nproperties of the four expanding nuclear bubbles were analysed, using the GMOS\n3D spectra and maps.

We recently used optical long-slit spectroscopy to study the\nNLRs of a sample of six Seyfert-2 galaxies. We have shown that such an\napproach, in comparison to the commonly used [OIII] narrow-band imaging alone,\nallows us to probe the size of the NLR in terms of AGN photoionisation.\nMoreover, several physical parameters of the NLR can be directly accessed. We\nhere apply the same methods to study the NLR of six Seyfert-1 galaxies and\ncompare our results to those of Seyfert-2 galaxies. We employ diagnostically\nvaluable emission-line ratios to determine the physical properties of the NLR,\nincluding the core values and radial dependencies of density, ionisation\nparameter, and reddening. Tracking the radial change of emission-line ratios in\ndiagnostic diagrams allows us to measure the transition between AGN-like and\nHII-like line excitation, and thus we are able to measure the size of the NLR.\nIn the diagnostic diagrams, we find a transition between line ratios falling in\nthe AGN regime and those typical for HII regions in two Seyfert-1 galaxies,\nthus determining the size of the NLR. The central electron temperature and\nionisation parameter are in general higher in type-1 Seyferts than in type 2s.\nIn almost all cases, both electron density and ionisation parameter decrease\nwith radius.

Abstract: Many nearby early-type (elliptical and S0) galaxies contain weak\n(milli-Jansky level) nuclear radio sources on scales a few hundred parsecs or\nless. The origin of the radio emission, however, has remained unclear,\nespecially in volume-limited samples that select intrinsically less luminous\ngalaxies. Both active galactic nuclei and nuclear star formation have been\nsuggested as possible mechanisms for producing the radio emission. This paper\nutilizes optical spectroscopic information to address this issue. A substantial\nfraction of the early-type galaxies surveyed with the Very Large Array by\nWrobel & Heeschen (1991) exhibits detectable optical emission lines in their\nnuclei down to very sensitive limits. Comparison of the observed radio\ncontinuum power with that expected from the thermal gas traced by the optical\nemission lines implies that the bulk of the radio emission is nonthermal. Both\nthe incidence and the strength of optical line emission correlate with the\nradio power. At a fixed line luminosity, ellipticals have stronger radio cores\nthan S0s. The relation between radio power and line emission observed in this\nsample is consistent with the low-luminosity extension of similar relations\nseen in classical radio galaxies and luminous Seyfert nuclei. A plausible\ninterpretation of this result is that the weak nuclear sources in nearby\nearly-type galaxies are the low-luminosity counterparts of more powerful AGNs.\nThe spectroscopic evidence supports this picture. Most of the emission-line\nobjects are optically classified as Seyfert nuclei or low-ionization nuclear\nemission-line regions (LINERs), the majority of which are likely to be\naccretion-powered sources. \n\n"}

This correlation is stronger than\nexpected based on the analysis of the Hipparcos catalog. We predict the\nparallaxes of individual cluster members, pi_pm, from their Hipparcos proper\nmotions, assuming that all cluster members have the same space velocity.

Assuming this, we show that for\nLMXB's with B_t of order 10^{13}G, the spindown from gw's is sufficient to\nbalance the accretion torque--supporting a suggestion by Bildsten. The spindown\nrates of most millisecond pulsars can also be attributed to gw emission sourced\nby toroidal B-fields, and both these sources could be observed by LIGO II.\nWhile the first-year spindown of a newborn NS is most likely dominated by em\nprocesses, reasonable values of B_t and the (external) dipolar field B_d can\nlead to detectable levels of gw emission, for a newborn NS in our own galaxy. \n\n"}

We determine all of the equilibrium points\nof the type VI_h state space (which correspond to exact self-similar solutions\nof the Einstein equations, some of which are new), and their stability is\ninvestigated. We find that there are vacuum plane-wave solutions that act as\nfuture attractors. In the parameter space, a `loophole' is shown to exist in\nwhich there are no stable equilibrium points. We then show that a\nHopf-bifurcation can occur resulting in a stable closed orbit (which we refer\nto as the Mussel attractor) corresponding to points both inside the loophole\nand points just outside the loophole; in the former case the closed curves act\nas late-time attractors while in the latter case these attracting curves will\nco-exist with attracting equilibrium points. In the special Bianchi type III\ncase, centre manifold theory is required to determine the future attractors.\nComprehensive numerical experiments are carried out to complement and confirm\nthe analytical results presented. We note that the Bianchi type VI_h case is of\nparticular interest in that it contains many different subcases which exhibit\nmany of the different possible future asymptotic behaviours of Bianchi\ncosmological models. \n\n"}
{"id": "hep-ph/0607029", "contents": "Title: Neighboring Valley in the String Landscape Abstract: The observation in the universe of a small but positive vacuum energy\nstrongly suggests, in the string landscape picture, that there will ultimately\nbe a phase transition to an exactly supersymmetric universe. This ground state\nor \"true vacuum\" of the universe could be similar to the minimal supersymmetric\nstandard model with all the susy breaking parameters set to zero.\nAlternatively, it might be similar to the prominent superstring theories with\nnine flat space dimensions or to the supersymmetric anti-deSitter model that\nseems to be equivalent to a conformal field theory. We propose that the\ndominant phenomenological feature of these potential future universes is the\nweakening of the Pauli principle due to Fermi-Bose degeneracy. Providing the\nphase transition occurs in the cosmologically near future, an exact\nsupersymmetry could extend the life expectancy of intelligent civilizations far\nbeyond what would be possible in the broken susy universe. \n\n"}
