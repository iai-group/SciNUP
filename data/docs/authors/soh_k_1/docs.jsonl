The main reason behind such a plausibility is that the\nwell-known Bekenstein-Hawking entropy-area proportionality -- the so-called\n`area law' of black hole physics -- holds for entanglement entropy as well,\nprovided the scalar field is in its ground state, or in other minimum\nuncertainty states, such as a generic coherent state or squeezed state.\nHowever, when the field is either in an excited state or in a state which is a\nsuperposition of ground and excited states, a power-law correction to the area\nlaw is shown to exist. Such a correction term falls off with increasing area,\nso that eventually the area law is recovered for large enough horizon area. On\nascertaining the location of the microscopic degrees of freedom that lead to\nthe entanglement entropy of black holes, it is found that although the degrees\nof freedom close to the horizon contribute most to the total entropy, the\ncontributions from those that are far from the horizon are more significant for\nexcited/superposed states than for the ground state. Thus, the deviations from\nthe area law for excited/superposed states may, in a way, be attributed to the\nfar-away degrees of freedom.

Interest in this\nproblem stems from its relationship to the non-linear stability of the black\nhole spacetimes themselves as solutions to the Einstein equations, one of the\ncentral open problems of general relativity. After an introductory discussion\nof the Schwarzschild geometry and the black hole concept, the classical theorem\nof Kay and Wald on the boundedness of scalar waves on the exterior region of\nSchwarzschild is reviewed. The original proof is presented, followed by a new\nmore robust proof of a stronger boundedness statement.

In this\nnote we demonstrate how quantum mechanics can emerge from classical statistical\nsystems. We discuss conditions and circumstances for this to happen.

The resulting field equation does not then contain\nthe CC term. This removes the connection between the CC and the quantum vacuum\nenergy, and therefore addresses the {\\it old} CC problem of why quantum vacuum\nenergy does not gravitate.

Hence, it is possible to understand, without\nfine-tuning, the very small current value of the CC as compared to its\ntheoretically expected large value in quantum field theory and string theory.\nIn our framework, this relaxation appears as a pure gravitational effect, where\nno ad hoc scalar fields are needed.

We showed recently[1] that the naked singularities that form due\nto gravitational collapse of massive stars provide a suitable environment where\nparticles could get accelerated and collide at arbitrarily high center of mass\nenergies. However, we focussed there only on the spherically symmetric\ngravitational collapse models, which were also assumed to be self-similar. In\nthis paper, we broaden and generalize the result to all gravitational collapse\nmodels leading to the formation of a naked singularity as final state of\ncollapse, evolving from a regular initial data, without making any prior\nrestrictive assumptions about the spacetime symmetries such as above. We show\nthat when the particles interact and collide near the Cauchy horizon, the\nenergy of collision in the center of mass frame will be arbitrarily high, thus\noffering a window to the Planck scale physics. We also consider the issue of\nvarious possible physical mechanisms of generation of such very high energy\nparticles from the vicinity of naked singularity. We then construct a model of\ngravitational collapse to a timelike naked singularity to demonstrate the\nworking of these ideas, where the pressure is allowed to be negative but the\nenergy conditions are respected. We show that a finite amount of mass-energy\ndensity has to be necessarily radiated away from the vicinity of the naked\nsingularity as the collapse evolves. Therefore the nature of naked\nsingularities, both at classical and quantum level could play an important role\nin the process of particle acceleration, explaining the occurrence of highly\nenergetic outgoing particles in the vicinity of Cauchy horizon that participate\nin extreme high energy collisions. \n\n"}

In the pure metric theory\nof gravity, conformal transformations change the frame to a new one wherein one\nobtains a conformal-invariant scalar-tensor theory such that the scalar field,\nderiving from the conformal factor, is a ghost.\n  In this work, conformal transformations and ghosts will be analyzed in the\nframework of the metric-affine theory of gravity.

It will be shown that, if affine connection is\ninvariant under conformal transformations then the scalar field under concern\nis a non-ghost, non-dynamical field.

The equations of motion,\nfor generic geometrical and matter-sector variables, do not reduce connection\nto the Levi-Civita connection, and hence, independence of connection from\nmetric is maintained.

The weaker the coupling,\nthe smaller the back-action on the system, but also the less information\nconveyed. If the system undergoes a second measurement, the statistics of the\nfirst output can be conditioned on the value of the second one. This procedure\nis known as postselection. A postselected weak measurement of an observable can\ngive a large average output of the probe when the postselected state is nearly\northogonal to the initial state of the system. This large value is an\ninterference effect in the readout of the probe, which is initially in a\ncoherent superposition of readout states (also known as pointer states).\nUsually, the weak interaction between system and probe is considered\ninstantaneous, so that the dynamics of the probe can be neglected. However, for\na weak measurement in solid-state devices, an interaction of finite duration is\nlikely needed.\n  Here, we show how this finite duration generates a contribution of the\ndynamical phase to the readout statistics. Furthermore, we derive interpolation\nformulas that are able to describe the statistics of the weak measurement for\nthe whole range of pre- and postselected states.

The criterion of vanishing quantum\ndiscord is related to the notion of reduction and, surprisingly, the\nhidden-variable model in $d=2$, which has been believed to be consistent so\nfar, is in fact inconsistent and excluded by the analysis of conditional\nmeasurement and reduction. The description of the full contents of quantum\ndiscord by the deterministic hidden-variables models is not possible. We also\nre-examine CHSH inequality. It is shown that the well-known prediction of CHSH\ninequality $|B|\\leq 2$ for the CHSH operator $B$ introduced by Cirel'son is not\nunique. This non-uniqueness arises from the failure of linearity condition in\nthe non-contextual hidden-variables model in $d=4$ used by Bell and CHSH, in\nagreement with Gleason's theorem which excludes $d=4$ non-contextual\nhidden-variables models.

When quantum information is\nencoded into a highly entangled ground state of this model and subjected to\nthermal errors, the errors remain easily correctable for a long time without\nany active intervention, because a macroscopic energy barrier keeps the errors\nwell localized. As a result, stored quantum information can be retrieved\nfaithfully for a memory time which grows exponentially with the square of the\ninverse temperature. In contrast, for previously known types of topological\nquantum storage in three or fewer spatial dimensions the memory time scales\nexponentially with the inverse temperature, rather than its square.\n  This spin model exhibits a previously unexpected topological quantum order,\nin which ground states are locally indistinguishable, pointlike excitations are\nimmobile, and the immobility is not affected by small perturbations of the\nHamiltonian.

Two of them are the most common,\nthe static form and the cosmological (exponentially expanding) form. The\nstaticity and non-stationarity of these two different forms are traced back to\nthe noncomoving and comoving nature of the corresponding coordinate systems. In\nthis paper using the quasi-Maxwell form of the Einstein field equations and a\ndefinition of static spacetimes based upon them, we look at these two different\nforms of the same solution from a new perspective which classifies them as a\nspecial case in a general one-parameter family of solutions. Specifically it is\nproved that, {\\it irrespective of the spacetime symmetry, a one-element perfect\nfluid in any frame noncomoving with the fluid could be the source of a static\nspacetime, only if its equation of state is that of a dark fluid namely $p =\n-\\rho = const.$}. These static solutions, which include the well-known de\nSitter spacetime, are called de Sitter-type spacetimes. To exemplify we\nconsider static axially and cylindrically symmetric de Sitter-type spacetimes\nand their dynamic (cosmological) versions.

Recently, it has been suggested that one may set up a\ndouble copy for gravitons defined around a non-trivial background.

We derived the matching conditions for\nthe spherically symmetric singular hypersurface (in our case it is equivalent\nto the world line) in the Weyl$+$Einstein gravity.

The result is the same as that found by Senovilla, it is\ndictated by the very possibility to have the double layer, but the jump in the\nnormal derivative of the radius may be not zero. It was found that in the\npresence of the double layer, the matching conditions contain an arbitrary\nfunction, and this result is quite new and very important. One of the\nconsequences of such freedom is that the trace of the extrinsic curvature\ntensor of the singular hypersurface is necessarily equal to zero. We suggested\nthe physical interpretation for the $S_0^n$ and $S_n^n$ components of the\nsurface matter energy-momentum tensor of the shell. In General Relativity they\nare zero by virtue of the Einstein equations. In the quadratic gravity they are\nnot necessarily zero. Our interpretation is that these components describe the\nenergy flow $(S^{0n})$ and the momentum transfer $(S^{nn})$ of the particles\nproduced by the double layer itself. Moreover, the requirement of the zero\ntrace of the extrinsic curvature tensor (mentioned above) implies that\n$S_n^n=0$, and this fact also support our suggestion, because it means that for\nthe observer sitting on the shell, the particles will be seen created by pairs,\nand the sum of their momentum transfers must zero.

We also show that relativistic interactions\nthat scale as higher powers of the tidal expansion parameter produce\nqualitatively similar effects to their Newtonian counterparts: there are\ncorrections to the Newtonian tidal distortion of each star, both of which occur\nat third order in the tidal expansion parameter, and there are corrections to\nthe Newtonian decrease in central density of each star (Newtonian ``tidal\nstabilization''), both of which are sixth order in the tidal expansion\nparameter.

Such black holes would initiate quasi-horizontal showers of\nparticles far above the standard model rate, so that the Auger Observatory\nwould observe hundreds of black hole events. This would provide the first\nopportunity for experimental study of microscopic black holes. However, any\nphenomenologically viable model with a low scale of quantum gravity must\nexplain how to preserve protons from rapid decay mediated by virtual black\nholes. We argue that unless this is accomplished by the gauging of baryon or\nlepton number, the suppression of proton decay will also suppress quantum\ngravity mediated lepton-nucleon scattering, and hence black hole production by\nscattering of ultra-high energy cosmic ray neutrinos in the atmosphere.

{"id": "hep-ph/0603244", "contents": "Title: Reheating in supersymmetric high scale inflation Abstract: Motivated by Refs \\cite{am1,am2}, we analyze how the inflaton decay reheats\nthe Universe within supersymmetry. In a non-supersymmetric case the inflaton\nusually decays via preheating unless its couplings to other fields are very\nsmall. Naively one would expect that supersymmetry enhances bosonic preheating\nas it introduces new scalars such as squarks and sleptons. On the contrary, we\npoint out that preheating is unlikely within supersymmetry. The reason is that\nflat directions in the scalar potential, classified by gauge invariant\ncombinations of slepton and squark fields, are generically displaced towards a\nlarge vacuum expectation value (VEV) in the early Universe. They induce\nsupersymmetry preserving masses to the inflaton decay products through the\nStandard Model Yukawa couplings, which kinematically blocks preheating for VEVs\n$> 10^{13}$ GeV. The decay will become allowed only after the flat directions\nstart oscillating, and once the flat direction VEV is sufficiently redshifted.\nFor models with weak scale supersymmetry, this generically happens at a Hubble\nexpansion rate: $H \\simeq (10^{-3}-10^{-1}) {\\rm TeV}$, at which time the\ninflaton decays in the perturbative regime. This is to our knowledge first\nanalysis where the inflaton decay to the Standard Model particles is treated\nproperly within supersymmetry. There are number of important consequences: no\noverproduction of dangerous supersymmetric relics (particularly gravitinos), no\nresonant excitation of superheavy dark matter, and no non-thermal leptogenesis\nthrough non-perturbative creation of the right-handed (s)neutrinos. Finally\nsupersymmetric flat directions can even spoil hybrid inflation all together by\nnot allowing the auxiliary field become tachyonic. \n\n"}

I investigate how low energy dynamical SUSY\nbreaking may arise from superstring models. In a three generation string\nderived model I propose that the unbroken hidden non--Abelian gauge group at\nthe string scale is $SU(3)_H$ with matter multiplets. Due to the small gauge\ncontent of the hidden gauge group the supersymmetry breaking scale may be\nconsistent with the dynamical SUSY breaking scenarios. The messenger states are\nobtained in the superstring model from sectors which arise due to the\n``Wilson--line'' breaking of the unifying non--Abelian gauge symmetry. An\nimportant property of the string motivated messenger states is the absence of\nsuperpotential terms with the Standard Model states. The stringy symmetries\ntherefore forbid the flavor changing processes which may arise due to couplings\nbetween the messenger sector states and the Standard Model states.

In a gravitating theory, all conserved\ncharges including the energy are given by boundary terms that can be measured\nat infinity. Thus, within any theory of quantum gravity, no information can be\nlost in black holes with a finite number of states.

Statistical mechanics of the strings reveals that\nscalar power spectrum of the cosmological fluctuations on cosmic scales is\nscale-invariant for closed strings and inclines towards red for open strings in\nthree compact spatial dimensions. This generation of thermal fluctuations\nhappens during the Hagedorn era of string gas cosmology and without invoking an\ninflationary epoch the perturbations enter the radiation-dominated era. The\namplitude of the fluctuations is proportional to the ratio of the two length\nscales in the theory, i.e., the Planck length over the string length.

Using path integration techniques, we show that the relative Casimir\nenergy vanishes exponentially fast in temperature. This is consistent with a\nsimple physical argument based on Kirchhoff's law. As a result the ``relative\nCasimir entropy\", which we define in an obviously analogous manner, tends, in\nthe classical limit, to a finite asymptotic value which depends only on the\ngeometry of the boundaries. Thus the Casimir force between disjoint pieces of\nthe boundary, in the classical limit, is entropy driven and is governed by a\ndimensionless number characterizing the geometry of the cavity. Contributions\nto the Casimir thermodynamical quantities due to each individual connected\ncomponent of the boundary exhibit logarithmic deviations in temperature from\nthe behavior just described. These logarithmic deviations seem to arise due to\nour difficulty to separate the Casimir energy (and the other thermodynamical\nquantities) from the ``electromagnetic'' self-energy of each of the connected\ncomponents of the boundary in a well defined manner.
