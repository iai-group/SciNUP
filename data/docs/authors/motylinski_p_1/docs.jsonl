A longstanding\ninfrared (IR) unsafety issue in such algorithms is often assumed to be solvable\nby adding extra `midpoint' seeds, but actually is just postponed to one order\nhigher in the coupling. A proper solution is to switch to an exact seedless\ncone algorithm, one that provably identifies all stable cones. The only\nexisting approach takes N 2^N time to find jets among N particles, making it\nunusable at hadron level. This can be reduced to N^2 ln(N) time, leading to\ncode (SISCone) whose speed is similar to that of public midpoint\nimplementations. Monte Carlo tests provide a strong cross-check of an\nanalytical proof of the IR safety of the new algorithm, and the absence of any\n'R_{sep}' issue implies a good practical correspondence between parton and\nhadron levels. Relative to a midpoint cone, the use of an IR safe seedless\nalgorithm leads to modest changes for inclusive jet spectra, mostly through\nreduced sensitivity to the underlying event, and significant changes for some\nmulti-jet observables. \n\n"}

We explore the possibility that they could be observably large\nin CMB, LSS, and Lyman-alpha data.

We then compare the flavor structure\nof the composite Higgs models to those in the RS model. We find new\ncontributions to flavor violation, which while still are suppressed by the\nRS-GIM mechanism, will enhance the amplitudes of flavor violations. In\nparticular, there is a kinetic mixing term among the SM fields which (although\nparametrically not enhanced) will make the flavor bounds even more stringent\nthan in RS.

For both the RS and the composite Higgs models the flavor\nbounds could be stronger or weaker depending on the assumption on the value of\nthe gluon boundary kinetic term.

The Higgs boson is insensitive to high energies because of\nsupersymmetry and also because it is a pseudo-Goldstone boson of a global\nsymmetry (referred to as double protection or super-little Higgs mechanism). A\nlarge shift in the Higgs quartic self coupling is obtained via a non-decoupling\nD-term coming from an extra gauge group, resulting in a Higgs that can be as\nheavy as 135 GeV with a tuning milder than 10%. With an appropriate choice of\nquantum numbers one can achieve that the additional quartic is generated\nwithout a corresponding shift in the Higgs mass, thus preserving the double\nprotection of the Higgs.

These equations of motion in physical space-time are\nequivalent to the equations of motion which describe the propagation of spin-J\nmodes in anti--de Sitter (AdS) space. Its eigenvalues give the hadronic\nspectrum, and its eigenmodes represent the probability distributions of the\nhadronic constituents at a given scale.

We show that,\nin addition to the well-known W helicity fractions, for polarised top decays it\nis worth to define and study the transverse and normal W polarisation\nfractions, that is, the W polarisation along two directions orthogonal to its\nmomentum.

For example, the rate for\n$D_s$ semileptonic decay is known to be $(17.0 \\pm 5.3)%$ lower than those for\n$D^0$ or $D^+$, and the model accounts for this difference. When applied to\nhadrons containing $b$ quarks, this method implies that the $B_s$ semileptonic\ndecay rate is about 1% higher than that of the nonstrange $B$ mesons. This\nsmall difference thus suggests surprisingly good local quark-hadron duality for\n$B$ semileptonic decays, complementing the expectation based on inclusive\nquark-hadron duality that these differences in rates should not exceed a few\ntenths of a percent.

We study this term using\nthe dual Holographic Description. We argue that in the dual picture the contact\nterm is saturated by the D2 branes which can be interpreted as the tunnelling\nevents in Minkowski space-time. We quote a number of direct lattice results\nsupporting this identification. We also argue that the contact term receives a\nCasimir -like correction $\\sim (\\Lqcd R)^{-1}$ rather than naively expected\n$\\exp(-\\Lqcd R)$ when the Minkowski space-time ${\\cal R}_{3,1}$ is replaced by\na large but finite manifold with a size $R$. Such a behaviour is consistent\nwith other QFT-based computations when power like corrections are due to\nnontrivial properties of topological sectors of the theory. In holographic\ndescription such a behaviour is due to massless Ramond-Ramond (RR) field living\nin the bulk of multidimensional space when power like corrections is a natural\noutcome of massless RR field. In many respects the phenomenon is similar to the\nAharonov -Casher effect when the \"modular electric field\" can penetrate into a\nsuperconductor where the electric field is exponentially screened. The role of\n\"modular operator\" from Aharonov -Casher effect is played by large gauge\ntransformation operator $\\cal{T}$ in 4d QCD, resulting the transparency of the\nsystem to topologically nontrivial pure gauge configurations. We discuss some\nprofound consequences of our findings. In particular, we speculate that a slow\nvariation of the contact term in expanding universe might be the main source of\nthe observed Dark Energy. \n\n"}

We compute the expected mixed axion-neutralino dark\nmatter abundance for the SUSY DFSZ axion model in two benchmark cases-- a\nnatural SUSY model with a standard neutralino underabundance (SUA) and an\nmSUGRA/CMSSM model with a standard overabundance (SOA).

In the SUSY\nDFSZ model, axions, axinos and saxions go through the process of freeze-in-- in\ncontrast to freeze-out or out-of-equilibrium production as in the SUSY KSVZ\nmodel-- resulting in thermal yields which are largely independent of the\nre-heat temperature.

While lattice QCD should be able to check this behavior\nin principle, the temperature range where lattice QCD works is rather limited\nin practice, because the topological charge is apt to freezes at high\ntemperatures.

It is thus timely to carefully investigate the expected antiparticle\nfluxes at high energies. Here, we perform such an analysis for the case of\nantiprotons. We consider both standard sources as the collision of other cosmic\nrays with interstellar matter, as well as exotic contributions from dark matter\nannihilations in the galactic halo.

We also show that if the dark\nmatter is composed of particles with masses at the TeV scale, which is\nnaturally expected in extra-dimensional models as well as in certain parameter\nregions of supersymmetric models, the annihilation flux can become comparable\nto - or even dominate - the antiproton background at the high energies\nconsidered here. \n\n"}
