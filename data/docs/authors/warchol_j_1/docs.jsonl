The nonresonant contributions arising from $B\\to\nP_1P_2$ transitions are evaluated using heavy meson chiral perturbation theory\n(HMChPT). The momentum dependence of nonresonant amplitudes is assumed to be in\nthe exponential form $e^{-\\alpha_{NR}} p_B\\cdot(p_i+p_j)}$ so that the HMChPT\nresults are recovered in the soft meson limit $p_i, p_j\\to 0$. In addition, we\nhave identified another large source of the nonresonant signal in the matrix\nelements of scalar densities, e.g. $<K\\bar K|\\bar ss|0>$, which can be\nconstrained from the decay $\\bar B^0\\to K_SK_SK_S$ or $B^-\\to K^-K_SK_S$. The\nintermediate vector meson contributions to 3-body decays are identified through\nthe vector current, while the scalar meson resonances are mainly associated\nwith the scalar density. Their effects are described in terms of the\nBreit-Wigner formalism. Our main results are: (i) All KKK modes are dominated\nby the nonresonant background. The predicted branching ratios of\n$K^+K^-K_{S(L)}$, $K^+K^-K^-$ and $K^-K_SK_S$ modes are consistent with the\ndata within errors. (ii) Although the penguin-dominated $B^0\\to K^+K^-K_{S}$\ndecay is subject to a potentially significant tree pollution, its effective\n$\\sin 2\\beta$ is very similar to that of the $K_SK_SK_S$ mode. However, direct\nCP asymmetry of the former, being of order -4%, is more prominent than the\nlatter.

To this end we\ngeneralize the usual notion of MT2 and define a new MT2(n,p,c) variable, which\ncan be applied to various subsystem topologies, as well as the full event\ntopology. We derive analytic formulas for its endpoint MT2{max}(n,p,c) as a\nfunction of the unknown test mass Mc of the final particle in the subchain and\nthe transverse momentum pT due to radiation from the initial state. We show\nthat the endpoint functions MT2{max}(n,p,c)(Mc,pT) may exhibit three different\ntypes of kinks and discuss the origin of each type. We prove that the subsystem\nMT2(n,p,c) variables by themselves already yield a sufficient number of\nmeasurements for a complete determination of the mass spectrum (including the\noverall mass scale). As an illustration, we consider the simple case of a decay\nchain with up to three heavy particles, X2 -> X1 -> X0, which is rather\nproblematic for all other mass measurement methods. We propose three different\nMT2-based methods, each of which allows a complete determination of the masses\nof particles X0, X1 and X2. The first method only uses MT2(n,p,c) endpoint\nmeasurements at a single fixed value of the test mass Mc.

However, it was recently suggested by Allaverdi, Dutta and\none of the authors (R.N.M.) that mixed, or bimodal, flavor neutrino scenarios\nare conceivable and are consistent with all known observations (these were\ncalled \"schizophrenic\" in the ADM paper). In that case each individual mass\neigenstate can be either Dirac or Majorana, so that the flavor eigenstates are\n\"large\" admixtures of both. An example of this \"bimodal\" situation is to\nconsider one mass state as a Dirac particle (with a sterile partner), while the\nother two are of Majorana type. Since only Majorana particles contribute to\nneutrinoless double beta decay, the usual dependence of this observable on the\nneutrino mass is modified within this scenario. We study this in detail and, in\nparticular, generalize the idea for all possible bimodal combinations.\nInevitably, radiative corrections will induce a pseudo-Dirac nature to the\nDirac states at the one-loop level, and the effects of the pseudo-Dirac mass\nsplitting will show up in the flavor ratios of neutrinos from distant\ncosmological sources.

As a concrete\nexample, we study in detail the final states with 4 jets plus missing energy.\nThis is a particularly challenging scenario because of large experimental\nsmearing effects and no fundamental distinction among the 4 jets. Based on the\nfact that the invariant mass of particles on the same decay chain has an end\npoint in its distribution, we define several functions which can distinguish\ndifferent topologies depending on whether they exhibit the end-point structure.\nWe show that all possible topologies (e.g., two jets on each decay chain or\nthree jets on one chain and the other jet on the other chain, and so on) in\nprinciple can be identified from the distributions of these functions of the\nvisible particle momenta. We also consider cases with one jet from the initial\nstate radiation as well as off-shell decays. Our studies show that the event\ntopology may be identified with as few as several hundred signal events after\nbasic cuts. The method can be readily generalized to other event topologies.

When the tops\ndecay, these correlations imprint themselves on the angular patterns of the\nfinal quarks and leptons. While many approaches to the measurement of top spin\ncorrelations are known, the most common ones require detailed kinematic\nreconstructions and are insensitive to some important spin interference\neffects. In particular, spin-1 resonances with mostly-vector or mostly-axial\ncouplings to top cannot be easily discriminated from one another without\nappealing to mass-suppressed effects or to more model-dependent interference\nwith continuum Standard Model production. Here, we propose to probe the\nstructure of a resonance's couplings to tops by measuring the azimuthal angles\nof the tops' decay products about the production axis. These angles exhibit\nmodulations which are typically O(0.1-1), and which by themselves allow for\ndiscrimination of spin-0 from higher spins, measurement of the CP-phase for\nspin-0, and measurement of the vector/axial composition for spins 1 and 2. For\nrelativistic tops, the azimuthal decay angles can be well-approximated without\ndetailed knowledge of the tops' velocities, and appear to be robust against\nimperfect energy measurements and neutrino reconstructions. We illustrate this\npoint in the highly challenging dileptonic decay mode, which also exhibits the\nlargest modulations.

We study the common origin of mu-tau and CP breaking in the\nDirac mass matrix of seesaw Lagrangian (with right-handed neutrinos being\nmu-tau blind), which uniquely leads to inverted mass-ordering of light\nneutrinos. We then predict a very different correlation between the two small\nmu-tau breaking observables theta_{13}-0 and theta_{23}-45, which can saturate\nthe present experimental upper limit on theta_{13}.

The periodicity with respect to L/E is broken by 2-3\noscillations which, in the case of the normal (inverted) hierarchy, shift the\nfirst 16 oscillations nearly 1% higher (lower) and move the next 16 lower\n(higher). The energy of each peak determines a particular combination of the\nmass differences, for example cos^2(theta12)Delta M^2_31 + sin^2(theta12)Delta\nM^2_32 for nearly all peaks visible at baselines under 40 km.

However, annihilation of Majorana DM to two fermions\noften features a helicity-suppressed s-wave rate. Radiating a gauge boson via\nelectroweak (EW) and electromagnetic (EM) bremsstrahlung removes this s-wave\nsuppression. The main purpose of this talk is to explain in some detail why the\nbranching ratio to a fermion pair is likely suppressed while the decay to the\npair plus a W/Z is not. In doing so, we investigate the general conditions for\ns-wave suppression and un-suppression using Fierz transformations and partial\nwave expansions. Suppression for the 2-to-2 process is sufficiently severe that\nthe EW and EM bremsstrahlung are likely to be the dominant modes of\ngauge-singlet Majorana DM annihilation. We end this talk with a discussion of\nthe challenge presented by space-based data for Majorana DM models, given that\nthe enhanced rate to radiated W and Z gauge bosons and their dominant decay via\nhadronic channels tends to produce more anti-protons than are observed. \n\n"}

Oriented event-shapes are\ndistributions of event-shape variables which are differential on the angle\ntheta_T that the thrust axis forms with the electron-positron beam. We show\nthat at any order in perturbation theory and for any event shape, only two\nangular structures can appear: F_0 = 3/8(1 + cos^2 theta_T) and F_1 = (1 -\n3cos^2 theta_T). When integrating over theta_T to recover the more familiar\nevent-shape distributions, only F_0 survives. The validity of our proof goes\nbeyond perturbation theory, and hence only these two structures are present at\nthe hadron level. The proof also carries over massive particles. Using SCET\ntechniques we show that singular terms can only arise in the F_0 term.

In particular, it should be valuable to\ninvestigate the high-energy exclusive processes which include generalized\nparton distributions (GPDs) and generalized distribution amplitudes (GDAs). The\nGPDs and GDAs contain momentum distributions of partons and form factors. We\nfound that the exotic nature appears in momentum distributions of quarks as\nsuggested by the constituent-counting rule and in the form factors associated\nwith exotic hadron sizes and the number of constituents. Transition GPDs to\nexotic hadrons could probe such exotic signatures. We also propose that these\nexotic signatures should be found in exclusive production processes of exotic\nhadrons from gamma^* gamma in electron-positron annihilation. For example, the\nGDAs contain information on a time-like form factor of the energy-momentum\ntensor of a hadron h. We show that the cross section of e gamma -> e+hbar h is\nsensitive to the exotic signature by looking at the hbar h invariant-mass\ndependence by taking light hadrons, h=f_0 (980) and a_0 (980).

With an\nadditional hard ISR jet, the two neutralinos from the stop decays are boosted\nin the opposite direction and they can give rise to some missing transverse\nenergy. This may be used to distinguish the stop decays from the backgrounds.\nIn this paper we study the semileptonic decay of such signal events for the\ncompressed mass spectrum.

Since the magnitude\nof this background depends strongly upon details of the detector response, it\ncan be difficult to estimate with simulation. One data-driven approach is the\n`matrix method', in which two categories of leptons are defined (`loose' and\n`tight'), with the tight category being a subset of the loose category.

In\naddition to the combination of previous searches, a targeted analysis requiring\nthree or more charged leptons (electrons or muons) is presented, focusing on\nthe challenging scenario in which the difference in mass between the two least\nmassive neutralinos is approximately equal to the mass of the Z boson. The\nresults are interpreted in simplified models of chargino-neutralino or\nneutralino pair production. For chargino-neutralino production, in the case\nwhen the lightest neutralino is massless, the combination yields an observed\n(expected) limit at the 95% confidence level on the chargino mass of up to 650\n(570) GeV, improving upon the individual analysis limits by up to 40 GeV.

Jet substructure\ntechniques are increasingly used in experimental analyses by the LHC\ncollaborations, both in the context of searching for new physics and for\nStandard Model measurements. On the theory side, the quest for a deeper\nunderstanding of jet substructure algorithms has contributed to a renewed\ninterest in all-order calculations in QCD.

We delineate the\ndecay channels in which most of the decay energy ionizes and heats the IGM gas\n(and thus affects the CMB), and those in which most of the energy is carried\naway -- e.g. photons with energies 100 keV < E < 1 TeV -- and thus appears as a\ncontribution to diffuse x-ray and gamma-ray backgrounds. The new constraints to\nthe decay-particle parameters from the CMB power spectrum thus complement those\nfrom the cosmic X-ray and gamma-ray backgrounds.

{"id": "physics/0007063", "contents": "Title: New Clock Comparison Searches for Lorentz and CPT Violation Abstract: We present two new measurements constraining Lorentz and CPT violation using\nthe Xe-129 / He-3 Zeeman maser and atomic hydrogen masers. Experimental\ninvestigations of Lorentz and CPT symmetry provide important tests of the\nframework of the standard model of particle physics and theories of gravity.\nThe two-species Xe-129 / He-3 Zeeman maser bounds violations of CPT and Lorentz\nsymmetry of the neutron at the 10^-31 GeV level. Measurements with atomic\nhydrogen masers provide a clean limit of CPT and Lorentz symmetry violation of\nthe proton at the 10^-27 GeV level. \n\n"}
