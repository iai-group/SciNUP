Evolution of magnetic fields by the constrained\ntransport algorithm preserves magnetic divergence to machine precision, and\nthus represents one preferred method for the inclusion of magnetic fields in\nsimulations. We show that constrained transport can be implemented with\nvolume-centered fields and hyperresistivity on a high-order finite difference\nstencil. Additionally, the finite-difference coefficients can be tuned to\nenhance high-wavenumber resolution. Similar techniques can be used for the\ninterpolations required for dealiasing corrections at high wavenumber.\nTogether, these measures yield an algorithm with a wavenumber resolution that\napproaches the theoretical maximum achieved by spectral algorithms. Because\nthis algorithm uses finite differences instead of fast Fourier transforms, it\nruns faster and isn't restricted to periodic boundary conditions. Also, since\nthe finite differences are spatially local, this algorithm is easily scalable\nto thousands of processors.

We model the transport\nin each of the different regions by its own $\\alpha$ parameter, this being 10\nto $10^{3}$ times smaller in dead zones than in active layers. In\ngravitationally unstable regions, $\\alpha$ is determined by the fact that the\ndisk self-adjusts to a state of marginal stability. We construct steady-state\nmodels of such disks. We find that for uniform mass flow, the disk has to be\nmore massive, hotter and thicker at the radii where there is a dead zone. In\ndisks in which the dead zone is very massive, gravitational instabilities are\npresent. Whether such models are realistic or not depends on whether\nhydrodynamical fluctuations driven by the turbulent layers can penetrate all\nthe way inside the dead zone. This may be more easily achieved when the ratio\nof the mass of the active layer to that of the dead zone is relatively large,\nwhich in our models corresponds to $\\alpha$ in the dead zone being about 10% of\n$\\alpha$ in the active layers.

The rotation axis of this system shows a strong\ntransition as a function of the projected distance from SgrA*.

In this paper, we propose measures of distance and\nfidelity between two quantum ensembles. We consider two approaches: the first\none is based on the ability to mimic one ensemble given the other one as a\nresource and is closely related to the Monge-Kantorovich optimal transportation\nproblem, while the second one uses the idea of extended-Hilbert-space (EHS)\nrepresentations which introduce auxiliary pointer (or flag) states.

In contrast, the EHS measures are. We present\noperational interpretations for both types of measures.

Each BL Lac\ncandidate has a high-quality SDSS spectrum from which we determine\nspectroscopic redshifts for ~60% of the objects. Redshift lower limits are\nestimated for the remaining objects utilizing the lack of host galaxy flux\ncontamination in their optical spectra; we find that objects lacking\nspectroscopic redshifts are likely at systematically higher redshifts.\nApproximately 80% of our BL Lac candidates match to a radio source in\nFIRST/NVSS, and ~40% match to a ROSAT X-ray source. The homogeneous\nmultiwavelength coverage allows subdivision of the sample into 637 radio-loud\nBL Lac candidates and 86 weak-featured radio-quiet objects. The radio-loud\nobjects broadly support the standard paradigm unifying BL Lac objects with\nbeamed radio galaxies. We propose that the majority of the radio-quiet objects\nmay be lower-redshift (z<2.2) analogs to high-redshift weak line quasars (i.e.,\nAGN with unusually anemic broad emission line regions).

Here we focus on a subclass of these events, where the light\ncurve is also tens of days wide, so the total radiated energy is order 10^{51}\nerg. If the origin of these SLSNe is a core-collapse-driven explosion of a\nmassive star, then the mechanism which converts the explosion energy into\nradiation must be very efficient (much more than in typical core collapse SNe,\nwhere this efficiency is of order one percent). We examine the scenario where\nthe radiated luminosity is due to efficient conversion of kinetic energy of the\nejected stellar envelope into radiation by interaction with an optically thick,\npre-existing circumstellar material (CSM), presumably the product of a steady\nwind from the progenitor. We base the analysis on a simple, numerically solved,\nhydrodynamic diffusion model, which allows us to identify the qualitative\nbehavior of the observable light curves, and to relate them to the parameters\nof the wind.

Of particular importance is the case where f(X)\nis a function of independent random variables X=(X_1, ..., X_n). Here the well\nknown bounded differences inequality (also called McDiarmid's or\nHoeffding-Azuma inequality) establishes sharp concentration if the function f\ndoes not depend too much on any of the variables. One attractive feature is\nthat it relies on a very simple Lipschitz condition (L): it suffices to show\nthat |f(X)-f(X')| \\leq c_k whenever X,X' differ only in X_k. While this is easy\nto check, the main disadvantage is that it considers worst-case changes c_k,\nwhich often makes the resulting bounds too weak to be useful.\n  In this paper we prove a variant of the bounded differences inequality which\ncan be used to establish concentration of functions f(X) where (i) the typical\nchanges are small although (ii) the worst case changes might be very large. One\nkey aspect of this inequality is that it relies on a simple condition that (a)\nis easy to check and (b) coincides with heuristic considerations why\nconcentration should hold. Indeed, given an event \\Gamma that holds with very\nhigh probability, we essentially relax the Lipschitz condition (L) to\nsituations where \\Gamma occurs. The point is that the resulting typical changes\nc_k are often much smaller than the worst case ones.\n  To illustrate its application we consider the reverse H-free process, where H\nis 2-balanced. We prove that the final number of edges in this process is\nconcentrated, and also determine its likely value up to constant factors. This\nanswers a question of Bollob\\'as and Erd\\H{o}s. \n\n"}

This mixing has the important qualitative effect of\nbreaking particle-hole symmetry as well as renormalizing the strength of the\ninterparticle interactions. Both effects could have important consequences for\nthe prospect that the fractional quantum Hall effect at $\\nu=5/2$ is described\nby states that support non-Abelian excitations such as the Moore-Read Pfaffian\nor anti-Pfaffian states. For GaAs, Landau level and subband mixing break\nparticle-hole symmetry in all Landau levels and subband mixing, due to finite\nthickness, causes additional short-distance softening of the Coulomb\ninteraction, further renormalizing the Hamiltonian; additionally, the Landau\nlevel and subband energy spacings are comparable so it is crucial to consider\nboth effects simultaneously.

Recently a\ntwo-TLS (two-level system) model was derived based on the microscopic\ncharacteristics of disordered lattices. Within the two-TLS model the\nquantitative universality of phonon attenuation, and the energy scale of $1-3$\nK below which universality is observed, are derived as a consequence of the\nexistence of two types of TLSs, differing by their interaction with the phonon\nfield. In this paper we calculate analytically and numerically the densities of\nstates (DOS) of the weakly and strongly interacting TLSs. We find that the DOS\nof the former can be well described by a Gaussian function, whereas the DOS of\nthe latter have a power law correlation gap at low energies, with an intriguing\ndependence of the power on the short distance cutoff of the interaction. Both\nbehaviors are markedly different from the logarithmic gap exhibited by a single\nspecies of interacting TLSs. Our results support the notion that it is the\nweakly interacting $\\tau$-TLSs that dictate the standard low temperature glassy\nphysics. Yet, the power-law DOS we find for the $S$-TLSs enables the prediction\nof a number of deviations from the universal glassy behavior that can be tested\nexperimentally.

As a byproduct, we obtain some new examples of\ndevice-independent witnesses for genuine four-partite entanglement, and also\ndevice-independent witnesses that allows one to infer the structure of the\nunderlying multipartite entanglement. \n\n"}

The problem is cast into a\nsequential framework since sensing time minimization is crucial for throughput\nmaximization. In the optimum solution, the sensing decision rule is coupled\nwith the channel estimator, making the separate treatment of the sensing and\nchannel estimation strictly suboptimal.

This definition implies that no particles can be present in the vacuum\nstate. In classical physics, the only features of vacuum are those of its\ngeometry. For example, in the general theory of relativity the geometry is a\ndynamical structure that guides the motion of matter, and, in turn, it is bent\nand curved by the presence of matter. Other than this, the classical vacuum is\na structure void of any physical properties, since classically properties are\nstrictly associated with physical objects such as particles and\nfinite-amplitude fields. The situation is very different in quantum physics. As\nI will show in this paper, the difference stems from the fact that in quantum\nphysics the properties are not strictly tied to objects. We know for example\nthat physical properties come into existence - as values of observables - only\nwhen the object is measured. Thus, quantum physics allows us to detach\nproperties from objects. This has consequences: one does not need pre-existing\nreal objects to create actual properties, and indeed under certain\nperturbations the quantum vacuum produces observable effects such as energy\nshifts and creation of particles.

We generalize an existing framework [Bashan et al, 2008] for\nadaptive allocation of sensing resources to the dynamic case, accounting for\ntime-varying target behavior such as transitions to neighboring cells and\nvarying amplitudes over a potentially long time horizon. The proposed adaptive\nsensing policy is driven by minimization of a modified version of the\npreviously introduced ARAP objective function, which is a surrogate function\nfor mean squared error within locations containing targets. We provide\ntheoretical upper bounds on the performance of adaptive sensing policies by\nanalyzing solutions with oracle knowledge of target locations, gaining insight\ninto the effect of target motion and amplitude variation as well as sparsity.\nExact minimization of the multi-stage objective function is infeasible, but\nmyopic optimization yields a closed-form solution. We propose a simple\nnon-myopic extension, the Dynamic Adaptive Resource Allocation Policy (D-ARAP),\nthat allocates a fraction of resources for exploring all locations rather than\nsolely exploiting the current belief state. Our numerical studies indicate that\nD-ARAP has the following advantages: (a) it is more robust than the myopic\npolicy to noise, missing data, and model mismatch; (b) it performs comparably\nto well-known approximate dynamic programming solutions but at significantly\nlower computational complexity; and (c) it improves greatly upon non-adaptive\nuniform resource allocation in terms of estimation error and probability of\ndetection. \n\n"}

A key ingredient of our approach is to replace single-analog\nforecasting with weighted ensembles of analogs constructed using local\nsimilarity kernels. The kernels used here employ a number of dynamics-dependent\nfeatures designed to improve forecast skill, including Takens' delay-coordinate\nmaps (to recover information in the initial data lost through partial\nobservations) and a directional dependence on the dynamical vector field\ngenerating the data. Mathematically, our approach is closely related to kernel\nmethods for out-of-sample extension of functions, and we discuss alternative\nstrategies based on the Nystr\\\"om method and the multiscale Laplacian pyramids\ntechnique. We illustrate these techniques in applications to forecasting in a\nlow-order deterministic model for atmospheric dynamics with chaotic\nmetastability, and interannual-scale forecasting in the North Pacific sector of\na comprehensive climate model.

We show that signatures of a strong\nparsec-scale jet and of an accretion disk emission are present in the SED. We\ncan link the observationnal VLBI jet features from MOJAVE to parameters\nexpected for a VHE emitting blob accelerated near the jet base.

We show that, in the small noise\nregime, both methods estimate twice the number of spikes as the number of\noriginal spikes. Indeed, we show that they both detect two neighboring spikes\naround the locations of an original spikes. These results for deconvolution\nproblems are based on an abstract analysis of the so-called extended support of\nthe solutions of L1-type problems (including as special cases the Lasso and\nC-BP for deconvolution), which are of an independent interest. They precisely\ncharacterize the support of the solutions when the noise is small and the\nregularization parameter is selected accordingly. We illustrate these findings\nto analyze for the first time the support instability of compressed sensing\nrecovery when the number of measurements is below the critical limit (well\ndocumented in the literature) where the support is provably stable. \n\n"}

RIAFs are typically collisionless in the sense that the Coulomb mean\nfree path is large compared to $GM/c^2$, and relativistically hot near the\nevent horizon. In this paper we develop a phenomenological model for the plasma\nin RIAFs, motivated by the application to sources such as Sgr A* and M87. The\nmodel is derived using Israel-Stewart theory, which considers deviations up to\nsecond order from thermal equilibrium, but modified for a magnetized plasma.\nThis leads to thermal conduction along magnetic field lines and a difference in\npressure, parallel and perpendicular to the field lines (which is equivalent to\nanisotrotropic viscosity).

The\nidentification of variable sources, such as AGNs, and the achievable redshift\naccuracy for varying objects are important in view of the science goals of the\nEUCLID and eROSITA missions. We probe AGN optical variability for a large\nsample of X-ray-selected AGNs in the XMM-COSMOS field, using the light curves\nprovided by the Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) 3pi and MDF04 surveys. Utilizing two\ndifferent variability parameters, we defined a sample of varying AGNs for every\nPS1 band. We investigated the influence of variability on the calculation of\nphoto-z by applying three different input photometry sets for our fitting\nprocedure. For each of the five PS1 bands, we chose either the epochs\nminimizing the interval in observing time, the median magnitude values, or\nrandomly drawn light curve points to compute the redshift. In addition, we\nderived photo-z using PS1 photometry extended by GALEX/IRAC bands. We find that\nthe photometry produced by the 3pi survey is sufficient to reliably detect\nvariable sources provided that the fractional variability amplitude is at least\n3%. Considering the photo-z of variable AGNs, we observe that minimizing the\ntime spacing of the chosen points yields superior photo-z in terms of the\npercentage of outliers (33%) and accuracy (0.07), outperforming the other two\napproaches. Drawing random points from the light curve gives rise to typically\n57% of outliers and an accuracy of 0.4.

Although the\nredshift quality generally improves when adding these bands, we still obtain\nnot less than 26% of outliers and an accuracy of 0.05 at best, therefore\nvariable sources should receive a flag stating that their photo-z may be low\nquality. \n\n"}

He provided\nintuitive arguments to show that the values of, say, the position and momentum\nof a particle can at least be unsharply defined, and they can be measured\ntogether provided some approximation errors are allowed. Only now, nine decades\nlater, a working theory of approximate joint measurements is taking shape,\nleading to rigorous and experimentally testable formulations of associated\nerror tradeoff relations. Here we briefly review this new development,\nexplaining the concepts and steps taken in the construction of optimal joint\napproximations of pairs of incompatible observables. As a case study, we deduce\nmeasurement uncertainty relations for qubit observables using two distinct\nerror measures.

We simulate a Milky\nWay-like halo in four different dark matter models and the cold dark matter\ncase. Our highest resolution simulation has a particle mass of $2.8\\times\n10^4\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot$ and a softening length of $72.4\\,{\\rm pc}$. We demonstrate\nthat all alternative models have only a negligible impact on large scale\nstructure formation.

The polarization signal primarily probes the\nquadrupole moment of the CMB, with a significant contribution from the\nprimordial dipole and octupole moments. For a typical cluster velocity of 1000\nkm/s, corrections to the quadrupole-induced polarization of a non-moving\ncluster are of the order of 2-10% between 200-600 GHz, and depend on cluster's\nposition on the sky, velocity magnitude and direction of motion.

It is well-known that if the parties have predetermined roles, then the\nstrategy where one of them waits at one vertex, while the other visits all $n$\nvertices in random order is optimal, taking at most $n$ steps and averaging\nabout $n/2$. Anderson and Weber considered the symmetric rendezvous problem,\nwhere both parties must use the same randomized strategy. They analyzed\nstrategies where the parties repeatedly play the optimal asymmetric strategy,\ndetermining their role independently each time by a biased coin-flip. By tuning\nthe bias, Anderson and Weber achieved an expected meeting time of about $0.829\nn$, which they conjectured to be asymptotically optimal.\n  We change perspective slightly: instead of minimizing the expected meeting\ntime, we seek to maximize the probability of meeting within a specified time\n$T$. The Anderson-Weber strategy, which fails with constant probability when\n$T= \\Theta(n)$, is not asymptotically optimal for large $T$ in this setting.\nSpecifically, we exhibit a symmetric strategy that succeeds with probability\n$1-o(1)$ in $T=4n$ steps. This is tight: for any $\\alpha < 4$, any symmetric\nstrategy with $T = \\alpha n$ fails with constant probability. Our strategy uses\na new combinatorial object that we dub a \"rendezvous code,\" which may be of\nindependent interest.\n  When $T \\le n$, we show that the probability of meeting within $T$ steps is\nindeed asymptotically maximized by the Anderson-Weber strategy.

Three-terminal spectroscopy allows us to identify the coupling to the\nN contacts as the origin of the Andreev resonance (AR) linewidths and to\ndetermine the critical coupling strengths to S, for which a ground state\ntransition S-QD systems can occur. We ascribe replicas of the lowest-energy ABS\nresonance to transitions between the ABS and odd-parity excited QD states, a\nprocess called excited state ABS resonances. In the conductance between the two\nN contacts we find a characteristic pattern of positive and negative\ndifferential subgap conductance, which we explain by considering two nonlocal\nprocesses, the creation of Cooper pairs in S by electrons from both N\nterminals, and a novel mechanism called resonant ABS tunneling. In the latter,\nelectrons are transferred via the ABS without creating Cooper pairs in S. The\nthree-terminal geometry also allows spectroscopy experiments with different\nboundary conditions, for example by leaving S floating. Surprisingly, we find\nthat, depending on the boundary conditions, the experiments either show\nsingle-particle Coulomb blockade resonances, ABS characteristics, or both in\nthe same measurements, seemingly contradicting the notion of ABSs replacing the\nsingle particle states as eigenstates of the QD.

We calculate the\nrate and analyze the consequences of three classes of collisions, those\noccurring between a dilute axion star and: another dilute axion star, an\nordinary star, or a neutron star. In all cases we attempt to quantify the most\nimportant astrophysical uncertainties; we also pay particular attention to\nscenarios in which collisions lead to collapse of otherwise stable axion stars,\nand possible subsequent decay through number changing interactions. Collisions\nbetween two axion stars can occur with a high total rate, but the low relative\nvelocity required for collapse to occur leads to a very low total rate of\ncollapses. On the other hand, collisions between an axion star and an ordinary\nstar have a large rate, $\\Gamma_\\odot \\sim 3000$ collisions/year/galaxy, and\nfor sufficiently heavy axion stars, it is plausible that most or all such\ncollisions lead to collapse.

In this work we consider unifilar\nchannels with noiseless feedback and study specific transmission schemes, the\nperformance of which provides lower bounds for the channel reliability\nfunction. In unifilar channels the channel state evolves in a deterministic\nfashion based on the previous state, input, and output, and is known to the\ntransmitter but is unknown to the receiver.

However, PCA has two major weaknesses. Firstly, it only\nconsiders linear correlations among variables (features), and secondly it is\nnot suitable for categorical data. We resolve these issues by proposing\nMaximally Correlated Principal Component Analysis (MCPCA). MCPCA computes\ntransformations of variables whose covariance matrix has the largest Ky Fan\nnorm. Variable transformations are unknown, can be nonlinear and are computed\nin an optimization. MCPCA can also be viewed as a multivariate extension of\nMaximal Correlation. For jointly Gaussian variables we show that the covariance\nmatrix corresponding to the identity (or the negative of the identity)\ntransformations majorizes covariance matrices of non-identity functions.

Unlike the majority of the previous\nexperimental and theoretical researches that consider the entanglement of a\nmechanical resonator with a cavity field created by red-detuned continuous-wave\nor blue-detuned pulsed driving field, we find that applying blue-detuned\ncontinuous-wave pump field to cavity optomechanical systems can achieve\nconsiderable degrees of quantum entanglement, which is generally challenging to\nobtain at high temperature for the known physical systems. The competition\nbetween the induced squeezing-type interaction and the existing decoherence\nleads to stable entanglement in dynamically unstable regime. There is a much\nmore relaxed condition for the existence of entanglement, as compared with the\nwell-known criterion for neglecting the thermal decoherence on optomechanically\ncoupled systems. A simple relation about a boundary in the parameter space,\nacross which the entanglement can exist or not, is found with an analytical\nexpression for the degree of the achieved entanglement at any temperature,\nwhich is derived for the systems of highly resolved sideband.

However, if the heavy-tail transient is plotted\nversus log-time, a reduced set of data around the inflection point of such a\nplot is sufficient for an accurate fit.

In the second part of the thesis we compute exactly\nthe stationary state of these models using a matrix ansatz. We shed light on\nthe connection between this technique and the integrability of the model by\npointing out two key relations: the Zamolodchikov-Faddeev relation and the\nGhoshal-Zamolodchikov relation.

The rotational J=1-0, 4-3, and 8-7 of HCN, HCO+, and HNC\nemission lines were clearly detected at a vibrational ground level (v=0).\nVibrationally excited (v2=1f) J=4-3 emission lines were detected for HCN and\nHNC, but not for HCO+. Their observed flux ratios further support our\npreviously obtained suggestion, based on J=3-2 data, that (1) infrared\nradiative pumping plays a role in rotational excitation at v=0, at least for\nHCN and HNC, and (2) HCN abundance is higher than HCO+ and HNC. The flux\nmeasurements of the isotopologue H13CN, H13CO+, and HN13C J=3-2 emission lines\nsupport the higher HCN abundance scenario.

The problem is formulated as a single-leader, multiple-follower\nStackelberg game between the power company and multiple prosumers. In this\ngame, the power company acts as a leader who determines the pricing strategy\nthat maximizes its profits, while the prosumers act as followers who react by\nchoosing the amount of energy to buy or sell so as to optimize their current\nand future profits. The proposed game accounts for each prosumer's subjective\ndecision when faced with the uncertainty of profits, induced by the random\nfuture price. In particular, the framing effect, from the framework of prospect\ntheory (PT), is used to account for each prosumer's valuation of its gains and\nlosses with respect to an individual utility reference point. The reference\npoint changes between prosumers and stems from their past experience and future\naspirations of profits. The followers' noncooperative game is shown to admit a\nunique pure-strategy Nash equilibrium (NE) under classical game theory (CGT)\nwhich is obtained using a fully distributed algorithm. The results are extended\nto account for the case of PT using algorithmic solutions that can achieve an\nNE under certain conditions. Simulation results show that the total grid load\nvaries significantly with the prosumers' reference point and their\nloss-aversion level. In addition, it is shown that the power company's profits\nconsiderably decrease when it fails to account for the prosumers' subjective\nperceptions under PT. \n\n"}

In the\n3mm wavelength band, we acquired more than 2600 observations, and all but one\nof our 37 sample sources were detected, most of them several times. For most\nsources, the observed distribution of the degree of circular polarisation is\nbroader than that of unpolarised calibrators, indicating that weak (<0.5%)\ncircular polarisation is present most of the time. Our detection rate and the\nmaximum degree of polarisation found, 2.0%, are comparable to previous surveys,\nall made at much longer wavelengths. We argue that the process generating\ncircular polarisation must not be strongly wavelength dependent, and we propose\nthat the widespread presence of circular polarisation in our short wavelength\nsample dominated by blazars is mostly due to Faraday conversion of the linearly\npolarised synchrotron radiation in the helical magnetic field of the jet.\nCircular polarisation is variable, most notably on time scales comparable to or\nshorter than our median sampling interval <1 month.

One possible\nmodification to General Relativity is the gravitational parity violation that\ngives rise to the amplitude birefringence in gravitational waves, where one of\nthe circularly-polarized mode is amplified while the other one is suppressed\nduring their propagation. In this paper, we study how well one can measure\ngravitational parity violation via the amplitude birefringence of gravitational\nwaves from stellar-mass black hole binaries. We choose Chern-Simons gravity as\nan example and work within an effective field theory formalism. We consider\ngravitational waves from both individual sources and stochastic gravitational\nwave backgrounds. Regarding bounds from individual sources, we estimate them\nusing a Fisher analysis and carry out Monte Carlo simulations by randomly\ndistributing sources over their sky location and binary orientation. We find\nthat the bounds on the scalar field evolution in Chern-Simons gravity from\nGW150914 are too weak to satisfy the weak Chern-Simons approximation, while\naLIGO with its design sensitivity can place meaningful bounds. Regarding bounds\nfrom stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds, we set the threshold\nsignal-to-noise ratio for detection of the parity-violation mode as 5 and\nestimate projected bounds with future detectors assuming that signals are\nconsistent with no parity violation. We find that a network of two\nthird-generation detectors is able to place bounds that are slightly stronger\nthan current binary pulsar bounds. Since gravitational wave observations probe\neither the difference in parity violation between the source and the detector\nor the line-of-sight integration of the scalar field, such bounds are\ncomplementary to local measurements from solar system experiments and binary\npulsar observations. \n\n"}

In a\nnatural conversation, there is an additional source of information to take into\naccount: utterances produced earlier in a conversation can also be referred to\nand a conversational IR system has to keep track of information conveyed by the\nuser during the conversation, even if it is implicit.\n  We argue that the process of building a representation of the conversation\ncan be framed as a machine reading task, where an automated system is presented\nwith a number of statements about which it should answer questions. The\nquestions should be answered solely by referring to the statements provided,\nwithout consulting external knowledge.

GCs form in converging gas flows\nand accumulate low-angular momentum gas, which accretes onto protostars.

The algorithms\nconsidered fall into two broad categories: resampling algorithms, analyzed via\ndifferent algorithmic LLL conditions; and backtracking algorithms, analyzed via\nentropy compression arguments. This paper introduces a new convergence\ncondition that seamlessly handles resampling, backtracking, and hybrid\nalgorithms, i.e., algorithms that perform both resampling and backtracking\nsteps.

In particular, in\nmeasurement-based quantum computing, checking whether correct graph states are\ngenerated is essential for reliable quantum computing. Several verification\nprotocols for graph states have been proposed, but none of these are\nparticularly resource efficient: multiple copies are required to extract a\nsingle state that is guaranteed to be close to the ideal one. The best protocol\ncurrently known requires $O(n^{15})$ copies of the state, where $n$ is the size\nof the graph state. In this paper, we construct a significantly more\nresource-efficient verification protocol for graph states that only requires\n$O(n^5\\log{n})$ copies. The key idea is to employ Serfling's bound, which is a\nprobability inequality in classical statistics. Utilizing Serfling's bound also\nenables us to generalize our protocol for qudit and continuous-variable graph\nstates. Constructing a resource-efficient verification protocol for them is\nnon-trivial. For example, the previous verification protocols for qubit graph\nstates that use the quantum de Finetti theorem cannot be generalized to qudit\nand continuous-variable graph states without tremendously increasing the\nresource overhead. This is because the overhead caused by the quantum de\nFinetti theorem depends on the local dimension. On the other hand, in our\nprotocol, the resource overhead is independent of the local dimension, and\ntherefore generalizing to qudit or continuous-variable graph states does not\nincrease the overhead. The flexibility of Serfling's bound also makes our\nprotocol robust: our protocol accepts slightly noisy but still useful graph\nstates. \n\n"}

A key tool is that $W_\\tau$ is skew-adjoint , and thus\ncan be characterized by a unique projection-valued measure, discrete by\ncompactness, and an associated orthonormal basis of eigenfunctions. These\neigenfunctions can be ordered in terms of a Dirichlet energy on the RKHS, and\nprovide a notion of coherent observables under the dynamics akin to the Koopman\neigenfunctions associated with the atomic part of the spectrum. In addition,\nthe regularized generator has a well-defined Borel functional calculus allowing\nthe construction of a unitary evolution group $\\{ e^{t W_\\tau}\n\\}_{t\\in\\mathbb{R}}$ on the RKHS, which approximates the unitary Koopman\nevolution group of the original system.

Nevertheless the model exhibits topological responses\nincluding the appearance of quantized fractional charge bound to rotational\ndefects (disclinations) and the pumping of angular momentum in response to\nthreading an elementary magnetic flux, which are described by a mutual\nChern-Simons coupling between the electromagnetic gauge field and an effective\ngauge field corresponding to the rotation symmetry. In addition, we show that\nalthough the filled bands of the model do not admit a symmetric Wannier\nrepresentation, this obstruction is removed upon the addition of appropriate\natomic orbitals, which implies `fragile' topology.

We begin by analyzing the behavior of bots in\nsocial networks and identify that they exhibit heterophily, meaning they\ninteract with humans more than other bots. We use this property to develop a\ndetection algorithm based on the Ising model from statistical physics. The bots\nare identified by solving a minimum cut problem. We show that this Ising model\nalgorithm can identify bots with higher accuracy while utilizing much less data\nthan other state of the art methods.\n  We then develop a a function we call generalized harmonic influence\ncentrality to estimate the impact bots have on the opinions of users in social\nnetworks. This function is based on a generalized opinion dynamics model and\ncaptures how the activity level and network connectivity of the bots shift\nequilibrium opinions. To apply generalized harmonic influence centrality to\nreal social networks, we develop a deep neural network to measure the opinions\nof users based on their social network posts. Using this neural network, we\nthen calculate the generalized harmonic influence centrality of bots in\nmultiple real social networks. For some networks we find that a limited number\nof bots can cause non-trivial shifts in the population opinions. In other\nnetworks, we find that the bots have little impact. Overall we find that\ngeneralized harmonic influence centrality is a useful operational tool to\nmeasure the impact of bots in social networks. \n\n"}

This paper proposes a novel method for autonomously detecting\ncasualties lying on the ground using obtained 3D point-cloud data from an\non-board sensor, such as an RGB-D camera or a 3D LIDAR, on a mobile rescue\nrobot. In this method, the obtained 3D point-cloud data is projected onto the\ndetected ground plane, i.e. floor, within the point cloud. Then, this projected\npoint cloud is converted into a grid-map that is used afterwards as an input\nfor the algorithm to detect human body shapes. The proposed method is evaluated\nby performing detection of a human dummy, placed in different random positions\nand orientations, using an on-board RGB-D camera on a mobile rescue robot\ncalled ResQbot. To evaluate the robustness of the casualty detection method to\ndifferent camera angles, the orientation of the camera is set to different\nangles. The experimental results show that using the point-cloud data from the\non-board RGB-D camera, the proposed method successfully detects the casualty in\nall tested body positions and orientations relative to the on-board camera, as\nwell as in all tested camera angles. \n\n"}

By adopting the canonical model for quiescent spectrum\nof soft X-ray transients, i.e. an absorbed neutron star atmosphere model plus a\npower law tail, Rutledge et al.

For\nexample, merging binary neutron stars can form \"hypermassive\" remnants\nsupported against collapse by differential rotation.

Instead, empirical\nstudies rely on traceroutes to build what are essentially single-source,\nall-destinations, shortest-path trees.

One of the requirements is the\nimplementation of decays into five mesons plus a neutrino with a realistic\ndecay amplitude. This note describes a step into this direction. For the 2pi-\npi+ 2pi0 mode the three decay chains tau- --> a_1- nu --> rho- (--> pi- pi0)\nomega (--> pi- pi+ pi0) nu, tau- --> a_1- nu --> a_1- (--> 2pi- pi+) f_0 (-->\n2pi0) nu, and tau- --> a_1- nu --> a_1- (--> pi- 2pi0) f_0 (--> pi + pi-) nu\nare introduced with simple assumptions about the couplings and propagators of\nthe various resonances. Similar amplitudes (without the rho omega\ncontributions) are adopted for the pi- 4pi0 and 3pi- 2pi+ modes.\n  The five-pion amplitude is thus based on a simple model, which, however, can\nbe considered as a first realistic example. Phase-space generation includes the\npossibility of presampling the omega and a_1 resonances, in one channel only,\nhowever. This is probably sufficient for the time being, both for physics\napplications and for tests.\n  The technical test of the new part of the generator is performed by comparing\nMonte Carlo and analytical results.

In\nparticular, unexpected large angle structures on the away side (opposite to the\ntrigger) have been found. Several explanations have been brought forward, among\nthem Mach shockwaves and Cherenkov radiation. Most of these scenarios are\ncharacterized by radial symmetry around the parton axis, thus angular\ncorrelations also determine the rapidity dependence of the correlation. If the\nobserved correlations are remnants of an away side parton after interaction\nwith the medium created in the collision, pQCD allows to calculate the\ndistribution $P(y)$ of the away side partons in rapidity.\n  The measured correlation then arises as a folding of $P(y)$ and the rapidity\nstructure of the correlation taking into account the detector acceptance.

An important advantage of the analysis is\nthat uncertainties of the extracted S17 coming from the use of the ANC method\ncan quantitatively be evaluated, in contrast to previous analyses using the\nVirtual Photon Theory (VPT). Calculation of measured spectra in dissociation\nexperiments is done by means of the method of Continuum-Discretized\nCoupled-Channels (CDCC). From the analysis of 58Ni(8B,7Be+p)58Ni at 25.8 MeV,\nS17=22.83 +/- 0.51(theo) +/- 2.28(expt) (eVb) is obtained; the ANC method\nturned out to work in this case within 1% of error.

In\ncontrast, Quantum Mechanics (QM) holds that if different measurement setups\ncannot coexist, then predictions about those can neither. Using an EPR-inspired\nexperiment with distantly separated measurements on pairs of entangled spinning\nparticles, Bell proved that no local hidden variable (HV) theory can describe\nreality in more detail than QM.
