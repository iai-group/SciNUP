{"id": "0803.3725", "contents": "Title: Axionic Mirage Mediation Abstract: Although the mirage mediation is one of the most plausible mediation\nmechanisms of supersymmetry breaking, it suffers from two crucial problems. One\nis the \\mu-/B \\mu-problem and the second is the cosmological one. The former\nstems from the fact that the B parameter tends to be comparable with the\ngravitino mass, which is two order of magnitude larger than the other soft\nmasses. The latter problem is caused by the decay of the modulus whose\nbranching ratio into the gravitino pair is sizable. In this paper, we propose a\nmodel of mirage mediation, in which Peccei-Quinn symmetry is incorporated. In\nthis axionic mirage mediation, it is shown that the PQ symmetry breaking scale\nis dynamically determined around 10^{10-12} GeV due to the supersymmetry\nbreaking effects, and the \\mu-problem can be solved naturally. Furthermore, in\nour model, the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is the axino, that is the\nsuperpartner of the axion. The overabundance of the LSPs due to decays of\nmodulus/gravitino, which is the most serious cosmological difficulty in the\nmirage mediation, can be avoided if the axino is sufficiently light. The\nnext-LSPs (NLSPs) produced by the gravitino decay eventually decay into the\naxino LSPs, yielding the dominant component of the axinos remaining today. It\nis shown that the axino with the mass of O(100) MeV is naturally realized,\nwhich can constitute the dark matter of the Universe, with the free-streaming\nlength of the order of 0.1 Mpc. The saxion, the real scalar component of the\naxion supermultiplet, can also be cosmologically harmless due to the dilution\nof the modulus decay. The lifetime of NLSP is relatively long, but much shorter\nthan 1 sec., when the big-bang nucleosynthesis commences. The decay of NLSP\nwould provide intriguing collider signatures. \n\n"}

We\ndiscuss the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuz'min (GZK) energy cutoff for cosmic protons,\nwhich is predicted due to photopion production in the Cosmic Microwave\nBackground (CMB). This is a process of modest energy in the proton rest frame.\nIt can be investigated to a high precision in the laboratory, if Lorentz\ntransformations apply even at factors $\\gamma \\sim O(10^{11})$. For heavier\nnuclei the energy attenuation is even faster due to photo-disintegration, again\nif this process is Lorentz invariant. Hence the viability of Lorentz symmetry\nup to tremendous gamma-factors - far beyond accelerator tests - is a central\nissue. Next we comment on conceptual aspects of Lorentz Invariance and the\npossibility of its spontaneous breaking. This could lead to slightly particle\ndependent ``Maximal Attainable Velocities''. We discuss their effect in decays,\nCerenkov radiation, the GZK cutoff and neutrino oscillation in cosmic rays. We\nalso review the search for LIV in cosmic gamma-rays.

We show that all tree amplitudes in N=4 SYM\nand N=8 SUGRA vanish at (supersymmetric) infinite complex momentum, and can\nthus be determined by recursion relations. We also identify the action of the\nnon-linearly realized E_{7(7)} symmetry of N=8 SUGRA on scattering amplitudes.\nWe give a simple discussion of the structure of 1-loop amplitudes in any QFT,\nin close parallel to recent work of Forde, showing that the coefficients of\nscalar \"triangle\" and \"bubble\" integrals are determined by the \"pole at\ninfinite momentum\" of tree amplitude products appearing in cuts. The on-shell\nsuperspace for maximal SUSY makes it easy to compute the multiplet sums that\narise in these cuts, leading to a simple proof of the absence of triangles and\nbubbles at 1-loop.

Using a technique that has been shown to determine $V$\ncompletely in terms of the renormalization group (RG) functions when using the\nColeman-Weinberg (CW) renormalization scheme, we first sum leading-log (LL)\ncontributions to $V$ using the one loop RG functions, associated with five\ncouplings (the top quark Yukawa coupling $x$, the quartic coupling of the Higgs\nfield $y$, the SU(3) gauge coupling $z$, and the $SU(2) \\times U(1)$ couplings\n$r$ and $s$). We then employ the two loop RG functions with the three couplings\n$x$, $y$, $z$ to sum the next-to-leading-log (NLL) contributions to $V$ and\nthen the three to five loop RG functions with one coupling $y$ to sum all the\n$N^2LL...N^4LL$ contributions to $V$.

Without considering any explicit flavour\nsymmetry, there is an instructive exercise one can do: to determine the\nsimplest flavour structures which can account for the data with a minimum\nnumber of parameters, simply assuming these parameters to be uncorrelated.

As the beam propagates through the plasma at the\nspeed of light, it sheds trailing sound waves with momenta $\\lesssim \\pi T$.\nPresumably these sound waves would thermalize in the plasma if they were not\nhit soon after their production by the next pulse of gluons from the\nlighthouse-like rotating quark. At larger and larger $q$, the trailing sound\nwave becomes less and less prominent. The outward going beam of gluon radiation\nitself shows no tendency to spread in angle or to shift toward larger\nwavelengths, even as it is completely attenuated. In this regard, the behavior\nof the beam of gluons that we analyze is reminiscent of the behavior of jets\nproduced in heavy ion collisions at the LHC that lose a significant fraction of\ntheir energy without appreciable change in their angular distribution or their\nmomentum distribution as they plow through the strongly coupled quark-gluon\nplasma produced in these collisions. \n\n"}

Tachyons are hypothetical superluminal particles that\nalways move faster than light. The existence of bradyons and luxons is firmly\nestablished, while the tachyons were never reliably observed. In quantum field\ntheory, the appearance of tachyonic degrees of freedom indicates vacuum\ninstability rather than a real existence of the faster-than-light particles.\nHowever, recent controversial claims of the OPERA experiment about superluminal\nneutrinos triggered a renewed interest in superluminal particles.

We show\nthat the all-loop integrand in N=4 SYM is naturally represented in this way.\nOn-shell diagrams in this theory are intimately tied to a variety of\nmathematical objects, ranging from a new graphical representation of\npermutations to a beautiful stratification of the Grassmannian G(k,n) which\ngeneralizes the notion of a simplex in projective space. All physically\nimportant operations involving on-shell diagrams map to canonical operations on\npermutations; in particular, BCFW deformations correspond to adjacent\ntranspositions. Each cell of the positive Grassmannian is naturally endowed\nwith positive coordinates and an invariant measure which determines the\non-shell function associated with the diagram. This understanding allows us to\nclassify and compute all on-shell diagrams, and give a geometric understanding\nfor all the non-trivial relations among them.

A crucial difference from the $D=10, N=1$ theory\nis that the fermions states are Dirac particles instead of Majorana-Weyl.

Representing the colour degrees of freedom with a\nsingle family of auxiliary variables the matter field transforms in a reducible\nrepresentation of the gauge group which - by adding a suitable Chern-Simons\nterm to the particle action - can be projected onto a chosen fully\n(anti-)symmetric representation. By considering F families of auxiliary\nvariables, we describe how to extend the model to arbitrary tensor products of\nF reducible representations, which realises a U(F) \"flavour\" symmetry on the\nworldline particle model.

By virtue of this observation the construction of the\nquark-gluon vertex becomes particularly compact. It turns out that the\naforementioned ghost-Green's functions play a crucial role, their net effect\nbeing the non-trivial modification of the ghost diagrams of the quark-gluon\nvertex in such a way as to reproduce dynamically the characteristic ghost\nsector of the background field method.

The task is accomplished in three\nsteps. The first step is the construction of a modified cobar complex adapted\nto a non-coassociative comultiplication. The following two steps each involve a\nnew, highly non-trivial, construction. The first construction, essentially\ncombinatorial, defines a differential graded Lie algebra structure on the\nsimplicial chain complex of the associahedra. The second construction, of a\nmore algebraic nature, is the definition of map of differential graded Lie\nalgebras from the complex defined above to the algebra of derivations on the\nbar resolution. Using the existence of this map and the acyclicity of the\nassociahedra we can define a so-called homotopy comodule structure on the bar\nresolution of a general Drinfeld algebra. This in turn allows us to define the\ndesired cohomology theory in terms of a complex which consists, roughly\nspeaking, of the bimodule and bicomodule maps from the bar resolution to the\nmodified cobar resolution. The complex is bigraded but not a bicomplex as in\nthe Gerstenhaber-Schack theory for bialgebra deformations. The new components\nof the coboundary operator are defined via the constructions mentioned above.\nAs an application we show that the Drinfel'd deformation of the universal\nenveloping algebra of a simple Lie algebra is not a jump deformation.

We show that in the large N limit use of Ward identities\nenables the pressure to be expressed in terms of two point Green's functions.\nThese satisfy the Kadanoff-Baym equations which are exactly solvable, and we\nexplicitly calculate the pressure for three illustrative choices of \\rho. \n\n"}

First\nI present the Callan-Maldacena construction of a fundamental string attached to\na threebrane, whereby the string is made out of the wrapped brane. This\ninterpretation withstands a rather detailed scrutiny, including the magnitude\nof the static tension and of the B-I charge; and Polchinski's mixed\nDirichlet/Neumann boundary conditions for small perturbations of the string.\nThe latter arise dynamically from the full non-linear equations of motion.\nAlso, the Born-Infeld charge is shown to produce the correct form of dipole\nradiation under the influence of harmonic oscillations of the string. The\nsecond part comprises of the application of these ideas to the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence. Using the essentially non-perturbative nature of the B-I action\nwe were able to construct in the near-horizon geometry of N D3-branes the\ncolor-singlet baryon vertex of the SU(N) gauge theory as a fivebrane wrapped on\nthe $S^5$ sphere, with B-I strings playing the role of the quarks.
