Thus far it has been proved difficult to reconcile such\ncorrelations with the empirically observed constituent quark number scaling\n(CQNS) at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC). To address this problem\nwe combine our earlier developed quark recombination model with quark\nphase-space distributions computed from relativistic Langevin simulations in an\nexpanding Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). Hadronization is based on resonance\nformation within a Boltzmann equation which recovers thermal equilibrium and\nobeys energy conservation in the quark-coalescence process, while the fireball\nbackground is adjusted to hydrodynamic simulations of semi-central Au-Au\ncollisions at RHIC. To facilitate the applicability of the Langevin process, we\nfocus on strange and charm quarks.

Measurements using bispectrum of cosmic microwave background\nanisotropies are limited by the cosmic variance, i.e. available number of\nmodes. Recent work has emphasized the possibility to probe non-gaussianity of\nlocal type using the scale dependence of large scale bias from highly biased\ntracers of large scale structure. However, this power spectrum method is also\nlimited by cosmic variance, finite number of structures on the largest scales,\nand by the partial degeneracy with other cosmological parameters that can mimic\nthe same effect. Here we propose an alternative method that solves both of\nthese problems. It is based on the idea that on large scales halos are biased,\nbut not stochastic, tracers of dark matter: by correlating a highly biased\ntracer of large scale structure against an unbiased tracer one eliminates the\ncosmic variance error, which can lead to a high signal to noise even from the\nstructures comparable to the size of the survey. The square of error\nimprovement on non-gaussianity parameter f_nl relative to the power spectrum\nmethod scales as Pn/2, where P and n is the power spectrum and the number\ndensity of the biased tracer, respectively. For an ideal survey out to z=2 the\nerror reduction can be as large as a factor of seven, which should guarantee a\ndetection of non-gaussianity from an all sky survey of this type. The\nimprovements could be even larger if high density tracers that are sensitive to\nnon-gaussianity can be identified and measured over a large volume. \n\n"}

The AGN is clearly\ndetected at a level of about 2 x 10^{-17} W m^{-2} in the observed 0.3-10.0 keV\nband by Swift in a 50 ks observation in 2007 September. For the first time\nsince the ROSAT All-Sky Survey observation in 1990 it was possible to derive an\nX-ray photon distribution by adding together all Swift observations that have\nbeen performed so far (85.5 ks in total). This photon distribution is\nconsistent with an X-ray spectrum of an AGN with a partial covering absorber\nwith a column density in the order of ~ 1 x 10^{23} cm^{-2} and a covering\nfraction of about 90%. A comparison with the 2002 Chandra data suggests that\nWPVS 007 has become brighter by a factor of about 4. The Swift data also\nsuggest that the absorber which is causing the current low-state may have\nstarted to disappear. This disappearance is indicated by a significant change\nin the hardness ratio from a very soft X-ray state during the 2005 October to\n2007 January observations to a rather hard X-ray state in the 2007 September\nobservations. In the UV, WPVS 007 seems to become fainter by up to 0.5 mag over\nthe last two years.

A one-zone synchrotron-self-Compton origin of the entire SED,\nincluding the VHE gamma-ray emission can be ruled out. The VHE emission could,\nin principle, be interpreted as Compton upscattering of external radiation\n(e.g., from the broad-line regions). However, such an interpretation would\nrequire either an unusually low magnetic field of B ~ 0.03 G or an\nunrealistically high Doppler factor of Gamma ~ 140.

This correlation holds over a\nluminosity range spanning by two orders of magnitude, with no indication of a\nflux saturation or cut-off.

This approximation ignores changes in the field structure\ncaused by the magnetospheric plasma and strong plasma currents. We present the\nfirst results of gamma-ray pulsar light curve modeling using the more realistic\nfield taken from 3D force-free magnetospheric simulations. Having the geometry\nof the field, we apply several prescriptions for the location of the emission\nzone, comparing the light curves to observations. We find that the conventional\ntwo-pole caustic model fails to produce double-peak pulse profiles, mainly\nbecause the size of the polar cap in force-free magnetosphere is larger than\nthe vacuum field polar cap. The conventional outer-gap model is capable of\nproducing only one peak under general conditions, because a large fraction of\nopen field lines does not cross the null charge surface. We propose a novel\n\"separatrix layer\" model, where the high-energy emission originates from a thin\nlayer on the open field lines just inside of the separatrix that bounds the\nopen flux tube. The emission from this layer generates two strong caustics on\nthe sky map due to the effect we term \"Sky Map Stagnation\" (SMS). It is related\nto the fact that force-free field asymptotically approaches the field of a\nrotating split monopole, and the photons emitted on such field lines in the\nouter magnetosphere arrive to the observer in phase. The double-peak light\ncurve is a natural consequence of SMS. We show that most features of the\ncurrently available gamma-ray pulsar light curves can be reasonably well\nreproduced and explained with the sepatratrix model using the force-free field.\nAssociation of the emission region with the current sheet will guide more\ndetailed future studies of the magnetospheric acceleration physics. \n\n"}

Using toy\ntemperature models and detailed heating histories from cosmological simulations\nof HeII reionization, we study the consequences of inhomogeneous heating for\nthe Ly-alpha forest. The impact of temperature fluctuations in physically\nwell-motivated models can be surprisingly subtle. In fact, we show that\ntemperature fluctuations at the level predicted by our reionization simulations\ndo not give rise to detectable signatures in the types of statistics that have\nbeen employed previously. However, because of the aliasing of small-scale\ndensity power to larger scale modes in the line-of-sight Ly-alpha forest power\nspectrum, earlier analyses were not sensitive to 3D modes with >~ 30 comoving\nMpc wavelengths -- scales where temperature fluctuations are likely to be\nrelatively largest.

The jet points towards the latter\nlobe, which is difficult to explain in a standard way within the double-lobed\nradio source paradigm. Here, I propose to assume that the nucleus of J1211+743\nhas undergone a re-ignition of activity and its lobes, presumably both\noriginally of FR II type, represent an earlier active phase, while the jet\nrepresents the current one. The asymmetry of the lobes is a consequence of the\norientation of the source combined with an activity switch-off that occurred\nbetween two active periods. The relic lobe is on the near side with regard to\nthe observer, whereas the radiation from the far-side lobe arrives\nsignificantly later owing to its longer distance to the observer. The far-side\nlobe is thus perceived to have not yet decayed. On the other hand, the jet\nbehaves in a standard way, i.e. its projected orientation reflects the near\nside of the source. Hence, we are able to explain why the location of the relic\nlobe correlates with the direction of the jet. \n\n"}

If one represents these fields in terms of partons (quarks and gluons),\nthe average number densities of the latter saturate at ultrahigh energies. At\nthat point, nonlinear effects become predominant in the dynamical equations.\nThe hadronic states that one gets in this regime of QCD are generically called\n\"color glass condensates\".\n  Our understanding of scattering in QCD has benefited from recent progress in\nstatistical and mathematical physics. The evolution of hadronic scattering\namplitudes at fixed impact parameter in the regime where nonlinear parton\nsaturation effects become sizable was shown to be similar to the time evolution\nof a system of classical particles undergoing reaction-diffusion processes. The\ndynamics of such a system is essentially governed by equations in the\nuniversality class of the stochastic Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piscounov\nequation, which is a stochastic nonlinear partial differential equation.\nRealizations of that kind of equations (that is, \"events\" in a particle physics\nlanguage) have the form of noisy traveling waves.

Here, we develop a framework for determining how much\nsensitivity is added to a gravitational-wave search by triggering on an\nelectromagnetic transient. We apply this framework to a variety of relevant\nelectromagnetic transients, from short GRBs to signatures of r-process heating\nto optical and radio orphan afterglows. We compute the expected rates of\nmulti-messenger observations in the Advanced detector era, and find that\nsearches triggered on short GRBs --- with current high-energy instruments, such\nas Fermi --- and nucleosynthetic `kilonovae' --- with future optical surveys,\nlike LSST --- can boost the number of multi-messenger detections by 15% and\n40%, respectively, for a binary neutron star progenitor model. Short GRB\ntriggers offer precise merger timing, but suffer from detection rates decreased\nby beaming and the high a priori probability that the source is outside the\nLIGO-Virgo sensitive volume. Isotropic kilonovae, on the other hand, could be\ncommonly observed within the LIGO-Virgo sensitive volume with an instrument\nroughly an order of magnitude more sensitive than current optical surveys. We\npropose that the most productive strategy for making multi-messenger\ngravitational-wave observations is using triggers from future deep, optical\nall-sky surveys, with characteristics comparable to LSST, which could make as\nmany as ten such coincident observations a year. \n\n"}

Indeed, it is well\nestablished both theoretically and observationally that galaxy clusters are\nmuch better approximated as triaxial objects. However, investigating the\nasphericity of galaxy clusters is still in its infancy. We review here this\ntopic which is currently gathering a growing interest from the cluster\ncommunity. We begin by introducing the triaxial geometry. Then we discuss the\ntopic of deprojection and demonstrate the need for combining different probes\nof the cluster's potential. We discuss the different works that have been\naddressing these issues. We present a general parametric framework intended to\nsimultaneously fit complementary data sets (X-ray, Sunyaev Zel'dovich and\nlensing data). We discuss in details the case of Abell 1689 to show how\ndifferent models/data sets lead to different haloe parameters.

If this\nscenario is correct, then short GRBs will be accompanied by the emission of\nstrong gravitational waves (GWs), detectable by GW observatories such as LIGO,\nVirgo, KAGRA, and LIGO-India. As compared with blind, all-sky, all-time GW\nsearches, externally triggered searches for GW counterparts to short GRBs have\nthe advantages of both significantly reduced detection threshold due to known\ntime and sky location and enhanced GW amplitude because of face-on orientation.\nBased on the distribution of signal-to-noise ratios in candidate compact binary\ncoalescence events in the most recent joint LIGO-Virgo data, our analytic\nestimates, and our Monte Carlo simulations, we find an effective sensitive\nvolume for GRB-triggered searches that is about 2 times greater than for an\nall-sky, all-time search. For NS-NS systems, a jet angle of 20 degrees, a\ngamma-ray satellite field of view of 10% of the sky, and priors with generally\nprecessing spin, this doubles the number of NS-NS short-GRB and NS-BH short-GRB\nassociations, to ~3-4% of all detections of NS-NSs and NS-BHs. We also\ninvestigate the power of tests for statistical excesses in lists of\nsubthreshold events, and show that these are unlikely to reveal a subthreshold\npopulation until finding GW associations to short GRBs is already routine.\nFinally, we provide useful formulas for calculating the prior distribution of\nGW amplitudes from a compact binary coalescence, for a given GW detector\nnetwork and given sky location. \n\n"}

Abstract: Soft gamma repeaters (SGRs) and anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs) are two groups\nof enigmatic objects, which have been extensively investigated in past few\ndecades. Based on the ample information about their timing behaviors, spectra,\nand variability properties, it was proposed that SGRs/AXPs are isolated neutron\nstars (NSs) with extremely strong magnetic fields, the so-called magnetars.\nNonetheless, some alternative models are probably equally convincing such as\nthose proposing that they are accreting NSs with a fall-back disk or\nrotation-powered magnetized and massive white dwarfs. The nature and nurture of\nSGRs/AXPs remain controversial. In this paper, we propose that SGRs/AXPs can\noriginate from normal NSs in binary systems. SGRs are a class of objects\ncontaining a neutron-drip core and denser crust with a stiffer equation of\nstate, which is formed from re-explosion of normal NSs in binary systems. It is\nthe accretion onto the denser crust that contributes to the observed hard\nemissions. AXPs are a group of NSs which reserve huge thermal energy in an\ninsulating layer above the surface. This structure accretes material from a\nmassive disk, manifesting themselves via release of deposited energy. The\nspin-period clustering is due to either the brake of a slowly rotating envelope\nor the frictional drag during the common-envelope phase. \n\n"}

While we do not yet have any\nsolid theory of quantum gravity, toy models of black hole solutions without\nsingularities have been proposed. So far, there are only non-rotating regular\nblack holes in the literature. These metrics can be hardly tested by\nastrophysical observations, as the black hole spin plays a fundamental role in\nany astrophysical process.

Hydrodynamical models show that the cooling\nof a shocked Wolf-Rayet star leads to a much greater difference (> 0.9 dex).\nOur proposed scenario is that of a jet produced during the explosion which\ndeposits 56Ni-rich material in the outer layers of the ejecta. The presence of\nhigh-velocity radioactive material allows us to reproduce the complete\nluminosity evolution of the object.

If the CRs are effectively\naccelerated at the formation of clusters, the kinetic energy of infalling gas\nis consumed by the acceleration and the gas entropy should decrease. As a\nresult, the entropy profiles become flat at the outskirts. If the acceleration\nis not efficient, the entropy should continue to increase outwards.

The evolving beta\nfunction develops a minimum that, as Q -> 0, just touches the axis at a_p (the\n\"pinch point\"), while the infrared limit of the optimized couplant is at a\nlarger value, a^star (the \"unfixed point\").

There is a strong evidence that these states have\nnon-conventional (or exotic) hadronic structures since their respective masses\nand decay channels observed experimentally are inconsistent with expected for a\nconventional charmonium state. The same phenomenon occurs on the bottomonium\nsector, where new states like Yb(10890) and Yb(11020) observed recently could\nindicate the existence of new bottomonium exotic states. In this way, one\nverifies that the Y(4140) state could be described as a D*sD*s (0++) molecular\nstate or even as a mixture of D*sD*s (0++) and D*D* (0++) molecular states. For\nthe Y(3930) and X(4350) states, both cannot be described as a D*D* (0++) and\nD*sD*s0 (1-+), respectively. From the sum rule point of view, the Y(4660) state\ncould be described as a \\psi' f0(980) molecular state. The extension to the\nbottomonium sector is done in a straightforward way to demonstrate that the\n\\Upsilon' f0(980) molecular state is a good candidate for describing the\nstructure of the Yb(10890) state.

In order to better constrain\ntheoretical models, it is especially important to get information from the\nregion close to the physical base of the jet, where the plasma acceleration\ntakes place. In this paper, we report multi-epoch and multi-frequency continuum\nobservations of the z=2.5 blazar PKS1830-211 with ALMA, serendipitously\ncoincident with a strong $\\gamma$-ray flare reported by Fermi-LAT. The blazar\nis lensed by a foreground z=0.89 galaxy, with two bright images of the compact\ncore separated by 1\". Our ALMA observations individually resolve these two\nimages (although not any of their substructures), and we study the change of\ntheir relative flux ratio with time (four epochs spread over nearly three times\nthe time delay between the two lensed images) and frequency (between 350 and\n1050 GHz, rest-frame of the blazar), during the $\\gamma$-ray flare. In\nparticular, we detect a remarkable frequency-dependent behaviour of the flux\nratio, which implies the presence of a chromatic structure in the blazar (i.e.,\na core-shift effect). We rule out the possiblity of micro- and milli-lensing\neffects and propose instead a simple model of plasmon ejection in the blazar's\njet to explain the time and frequency variability of the flux ratio. We suggest\nthat PKS1830-211 is likely one of the best sources to probe the activity at the\nbase of a blazar's jet at submillimeter wavelengths, thanks to the peculiar\ngeometry of the system. The implications of the core-shift in absorption\nstudies of the foreground z=0.89 galaxy (e.g., constraints on the cosmological\nvariations of fundamental constants) are discussed. \n\n"}

Due to dissipative processes, the thermal plasma of\nthe ICM contains useless information about the formation of structures and CRs.\nSuch past and current information is carried intact by its non-thermal emission\ncaused by highly relativistic particles spiraling in large-scale magnetic\nfields. The diffuse radio emission is not associated with the active galactic\nnucleus phenomenon and has no optical counterpart. Instead it is associated\nwith the ICM and it is characterized by steep spectrum. The low surface radio\nbrightness features are thought to be formed via re-acceleration of a relic\npopulation of relativistic electrons, or proton-proton collisions with the ICM.\nDiffuse radio sources are classified typically as `relics', `halos',\n'mini-halos' and 'radio-ghosts'.

Despite predictions of large populations of both ordinary and\nmillisecond pulsars in the Galactic center, none have been detected within 25\npc by deep radio surveys. One explanation has been that hyperstrong temporal\nscattering prevents pulsar detections, but the recent discovery of radio\npulsations from a highly magnetized neutron star (magnetar) within 0.1 pc shows\nthat the temporal scattering is much weaker than predicted. We argue that an\nintrinsic deficit in the ordinary pulsar population is the most likely reason\nfor the lack of detections to date: a \"missing pulsar problem\" in the Galactic\ncenter. In contrast, we show that the discovery of a single magnetar implies\nefficient magnetar formation in the region. If the massive stars in the central\nparsec form magnetars rather than ordinary pulsars, their short lifetimes could\nexplain the missing pulsars. Efficient magnetar formation could be caused by\nstrongly magnetized progenitors, or could be further evidence of a top-heavy\ninitial mass function.

When endowed\nwith additional heavy fields, such as right-handed neutrinos or extra triplets,\nit also provides a compelling framework for baryogenesis via leptogenesis. We\nderive in this context the full network of Boltzmann equations for studying\nleptogenesis in the flavored regime. To this end we determine the relations\nwhich hold among the chemical potentials of the various particle species in the\nthermal bath. This takes into account the SM Yukawa interactions of both\nleptons and quarks as well as sphaleron processes which, depending on the\ntemperature, may be classified as faster or slower than the Hubble rate. We\nfind that when leptogenesis is enabled by the presence of an extra triplet,\nlepton flavor effects allow the production of the $B-L$ asymmetry through\nlepton number conserving CP asymmetries. This scenario becomes dominant as soon\nas the triplets couple more to leptons than to SM scalar doublets. In this\ncase, the way the $B-L$ asymmetry is created through flavor effects is novel:\ninstead of invoking the effect of $L$-violating inverse decays faster than the\nHubble rate, it involves the effect of $L$-violating inverse decays slower than\nthe Hubble rate. We also analyze the more general situation where lepton number\nviolating CP asymmetries are present and actively participate in the generation\nof the $B-L$ asymmetry, pointing out that as long as $L$-violating triplet\ndecays are still in thermal equilibrium when the triplet gauge scattering\nprocesses decouple, flavor effects can be striking, allowing to avoid all\nwashout suppression effects from seesaw interactions. In this case the amount\nof $B-L$ asymmetry produced is limited only by a universal gauge suppression\neffect, which nevertheless goes away for large triplet decay rates. \n\n"}

Several explanations have already been\nconsidered, but the existence of dual tracks is not yet fully understood.\n  We suggest that in the hard spectral state re-condensation of gas from the\ncorona into a cool, weak inner disk can provide additional soft photons for\nComptonization, leading to a higher X-ray luminosity in combination with rather\nunchanged radio emission, which presumably traces the mass accretion rate. As\nan example, we determined how much additional luminosity due to photons from an\nunderlying disk would be needed to explain the data from the representative\noutlier source H1743-322. From the comparison with calculations of Compton\nspectra with and without the photons from an underlying disk, we find that the\nrequired additional X-ray luminosity lies well in the range obtained from\ntheoretical models of the accretion flow. The radio/X-ray luminosity relation\nresulting from Comptonization of additional photons from a weak, cool inner\ndisk during the hard spectral state can explain the observations of the outlier\nsources, especially the data for H1743-322, the source with the most detailed\nobservations.

Continuous energy injection via successive supernovae\ngoing off within the hot/dilute bubble maintains a strong termination shock.\nThis strong shock keeps the superbubble over-pressured and drives the outer\nshock well after it becomes radiative. Isolated supernovae, in contrast, with\nno further energy injection, become radiative quite early ($\\lesssim 0.1$ Myr,\n10s of pc), and stall at scales $\\lesssim 100$ pc.

Furthermore, it is shown that ignoring the azimuthal\nasymmetry of Cherenkov light might lead to a significant under- or\noverestimation of the Cherenkov light signal especially at sites where the\nlocal geomagnetic field is strong. Based on CORSIKA simulations, the azimuthal\ndistribution of Cherenkov light is parametrized in dependence on the magnetic\nfield component perpendicular to the shower axis and the local air density.\nThis parametrization provides an efficient approximation for estimating the\nasymmetry of the Cherenkov light distribution for shower simulation and\nreconstruction in cosmic ray and gamma-ray experiments in which the Cherenkov\nsignal of showers with energies above 10^14 eV is observed. \n\n"}

The discovery of the unique source HESS J1507-622 in the very high\nenergy (VHE) range (100 GeV-100 TeV) opened new possibilities to study the\nparent population of ultra-relativistic particles found in astrophysical\nsources and underlined the possibility of new scenarios/mechanisms crucial for\nunderstanding the underlying astrophysical processes in nonthermal sources.\nAims. The follow-up X-ray (0.2 - 10 keV) observations on HESS J1507-622 are\nreported, and possibilities regarding the nature of the VHE source and that of\nthe newly discovered X-ray sources are investigated. Methods.We obtained\nbservations with the X-ray satellites XMM-Newton and Chandra. Background\ncorrections were applied to the data to search for extended diffuse emission.\nSince HESS J1507-622 covers a large part of the field of view of these\ninstruments, blank-sky background fields were used. Results. The discovery of\nseveral new X-ray sources and a new, faint, extended X-ray source with a flux\nof ~6e-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1 is reported. Interestingly, a new, variable point-like\nX-ray source with a flux of ~8e-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1 appeared in the 2011\nobservation, which was not detected in the previous X-ray observations.\nConclusions. The X-ray observations revealed a faint, extended X-ray source\nthat may be a possible counterpart for HESS J1507-622. This source could be an\nX-ray pulsar wind nebula (PWN) remnant of the larger gamma-ray PWN, which is\nstill bright in IC emission.

Abstract: The precise determination of the CKM elements $V_{cb}$ and $V_{ub}$ is\ncrucial for any new physics analysis in the flavour sector. Their values can be\ndetermined from several tree-level decays: $V_{cb}$ can be extracted from $B\\to\nD\\ell\\nu$ and $B\\to D^*\\ell\\nu$ while $V_{ub}$ can be obtained from $B\\to\n\\pi\\ell\\nu$, $B\\to \\rho\\ell\\nu$ and $B\\to\\tau\\nu$. In addition, for both $V_{cb\n}$ and $V_{ub}$ an inclusive determination is available. There is a long\nlasting discrepancy between the inclusive and exclusive determinations which\nrecently even increased for $V_{cb}$ above the $3\\;\\sigma$ level. In this\narticle we study the possible effect of new physics on the inclusive and\nexclusive determination of $V_{cb}$ and $V_{ub}$ in a model independent way.

We consider\ntwo supernova progenitor masses with homogeneous and clumpy ejecta to assess\nthe chemical type and quantity of dust that forms. Grain size distributions are\nderived as a function of post-explosion time. Methods: The chemistry of the gas\nphase and the simultaneous formation of dust clusters are described by a\nchemical network. The formation of key species (CO, SiO) and dust clusters of\nsilicates, alumina, silica, metal carbides and sulphides, pure metals, and\namorphous carbon is considered. The master equations describing the chemistry\nof the nucleation phase are coupled to a dust condensation formalism based on\nBrownian coagulation. Results: Type II-P supernovae produce dust grains of\nvarious chemical compositions and size distributions as a function of time. The\ngrain size distributions gain in complexity with time, are slewed towards large\ngrains, and differ from the usual MRN power-law distribution used for\ninterstellar dust. Gas density enhancements in the form of clumps strongly\naffect the dust chemical composition and the grain size distributions.\nSilicates and pure metallic grains are highly dependent on clumpiness.\nSpecifically, clumpy ejecta produce grains over 0.1 micron, and the final dust\nmass reaches 0.14 Msun. Conversely, carbon and alumina dust masses are\ncontrolled by the mass yields of alumina and carbon in the zones where the dust\nis produced. Several dust components form in the ejecta and the total dust mass\ngradually builds up over a time span of 3 to 5 years post-outburst. This\ngradual growth provides a possible explanation for the discrepancy between the\nsmall dust masses formed at early post-explosion times and the high dust masses\nderived from recent observations of supernova remnants. \n\n"}

The progenitor is a nonrotating,\nzero-metallicity 9.6 Msun star with an iron core. While in spherical symmetry\noutward shock acceleration sets in later than 300 ms after bounce, a successful\nexplosion starts at ~130 ms postbounce in two dimensions (2D). The 3D model\nexplodes at about the same time but with faster shock expansion than in 2D and\na more quickly increasing and roughly 10 percent higher explosion energy of\n>10^50 erg. The more favorable explosion conditions in 3D are explained by\nlower temperatures and thus reduced neutrino emission in the cooling layer\nbelow the gain radius. This moves the gain radius inward and leads to a bigger\nmass in the gain layer, whose larger recombination energy boosts the explosion\nenergy in 3D. These differences are caused by less coherent, less massive, and\nless rapid convective downdrafts associated with postshock convection in 3D.\nThe less violent impact of these accretion downflows in the cooling layer\nproduces less shock heating and therefore diminishes energy losses by neutrino\nemission. We thus have, for the first time, identified a reduced mass accretion\nrate, lower infall velocities, and a smaller surface filling factor of\nconvective downdrafts as consequences of 3D postshock turbulence that\nfacilitate neutrino-driven explosions and strengthen them compared to the 2D\ncase. \n\n"}

Outflows may probably be driven from the disc if the\nradiation flux of the disc is greater than a critical value corresponding to\nthe maximal vertical gravity. We find that outflows are driven by the radiation\nforce from the disc if the accretion rate is greater than the Eddington rate.\nThe radiation of the disc is therefore limited by such outflows. The disc\nluminosity, L=L_Edd\\propto ln mdot, at large-mdot cases. The Eddington ratio of\nthe disc is ~3 for mdot~100, which is significantly lower than that of a\nconventional slim disc without outflows. This implies that the emission from\nsome ultra-luminous X-ray sources with highly super Eddington luminosity should\nbe Doppler beamed, or intermediate mass black holes are in these sources\ninstead of stellar mass black holes. The spectra of the discs with outflows are\nsaturated in the high frequency end provided mdot>2.

The shape of the\nobserved distribution of white dwarfs with masses up to $1.25 M_{\\odot}$ rules\nout primordial black holes with masses $\\sim 10^{19}$ gm - $10^{20}$ gm as a\ndominant constituent of the local dark matter density. Black holes with masses\nas large as $10^{24}$ gm will be excluded if recent observations by the NuStar\ncollaboration of a population of white dwarfs near the galactic center are\nconfirmed. Black holes in the mass range $10^{20}$ gm - $10^{22}$ gm are also\nconstrained by the observed supernova rate, though these bounds are subject to\nastrophysical uncertainties.

{"id": "1505.04719", "contents": "Title: Metallicity at the explosion sites of interacting transients Abstract: Context. Some circumstellar-interacting (CSI) supernovae (SNe) are produced\nby the explosions of massive stars that have lost mass shortly before the SN\nexplosion. There is evidence that the precursors of some SNe IIn were luminous\nblue variable (LBV) stars. For a small number of CSI SNe, outbursts have been\nobserved before the SN explosion. Eruptive events of massive stars are named as\nSN impostors (SN IMs) and whether they herald a forthcoming SN or not is still\nunclear. The large variety of observational properties of CSI SNe suggests the\nexistence of other progenitors, such as red supergiant (RSG) stars with\nsuperwinds. Furthermore, the role of metallicity in the mass loss of CSI SN\nprogenitors is still largely unexplored. Aims. Our goal is to gain insight on\nthe nature of the progenitor stars of CSI SNe by studying their environments,\nin particular the metallicity at their locations. Methods. We obtain\nmetallicity measurements at the location of 60 transients (including SNe IIn,\nSNe Ibn, and SN IMs), via emission-line diagnostic on optical spectra obtained\nat the Nordic Optical Telescope and through public archives. Metallicity values\nfrom the literature complement our sample. We compare the metallicity\ndistributions among the different CSI SN subtypes and to those of other\ncore-collapse SN types. We also search for possible correlations between\nmetallicity and CSI SN observational properties. Results. We find that SN IMs\ntend to occur in environments with lower metallicity than those of SNe IIn.\nAmong SNe IIn, SN IIn-L(1998S-like) SNe show higher metallicities, similar to\nthose of SNe IIL/P, whereas long-lasting SNe IIn (1988Z-like) show lower\nmetallicities, similar to those of SN IMs. The metallicity distribution of SNe\nIIn can be reproduced by combining the metallicity distributions of SN IMs\n(that may be produced by major outbursts of massive stars like LBVs) and SNe\nIIP (produced by RSGs). The same applies to the distributions of the Normalized\nCumulative Rank (NCR) values, which quantifies the SN association to H II\nregions. For SNe IIn, we find larger mass-loss rates and higher CSM velocities\nat higher metallicities. The luminosity increment in the optical bands during\nSN IM outbursts tend to be larger at higher metallicity, whereas the SN IM\nquiescent optical luminosities tend to be lower. Conclusions. The difference in\nmetallicity between SNe IIn and SN IMs suggests that LBVs are only one of the\nprogenitor channels for SNe IIn, with 1988Z-like and 1998S-like SNe possibly\narising from LBVs and RSGs, respectively. Finally, even though linedriven winds\nlikely do not primarily drive the late mass-loss of CSI SN progenitors,\nmetallicity has some impact on the observational properties of these\ntransients.

Any instance of a C++ class can be stored into a ROOT file in a\nmachine-independent compressed binary format.

In order to analyze this data, the user can chose out of a wide set of\nmathematical and statistical functions, including linear algebra classes,\nnumerical algorithms such as integration and minimization, and various methods\nfor performing regression analysis (fitting). In particular, ROOT offers\npackages for complex data modeling and fitting, as well as multivariate\nclassification based on machine learning techniques. A central piece in these\nanalysis tools are the histogram classes which provide binning of one- and\nmulti-dimensional data. Results can be saved in high-quality graphical formats\nlike Postscript and PDF or in bitmap formats like JPG or GIF.

When\ninitiated with a vertical magnetic field of either zero or finite net flux, our\nglobal cylindrical simulations exhibit the magnetorotational instability (MRI)\nand large scale dynamo growth of radially alternating mean fields, averaged\nover height and azimuth. This dynamo growth is explained by our analytic\ncalculations of a non-axisymmetric fluctuation-induced EMF that is sustained by\nazimuthal shear of the fluctuating fields. The standard \"Omega effect\" (shear\nof the mean field by differential rotation) is unimportant. For the MRI case,\nwe express the large-scale dynamo field as a function of differential rotation.\nThe resulting radially alternating large-scale fields may have implications for\nangular momentum transport in disks and corona. To connect with previous work\non large scale dynamos with local linear shear and identify the minimum\nconditions needed for large scale field growth, we also solve our equations in\nlocal Cartesian coordinates.

Turbulence is known to change the nature\nof many physical processes dramatically and in this review we claim that\nmagnetic reconnection is not an exception.

We also provide quantitative comparisons of the theoretical\npredictions and results of numerical experiments, including the situations when\nturbulent reconnection is self-driven, i.e. the turbulence in the system is\ngenerated by the reconnection process itself.

RadioAstron\ndetections of the classic quasar 3C273 on interferometric baselines up to\n171,000 km suggest brightness temperatures exceeding expected limits from the\n\"inverse-Compton catastrophe\" by two orders of magnitude. We show that at 18\ncm, these estimates most probably arise from refractive substructure introduced\nby scattering in the interstellar medium.

We study\nthe effects of this iron opacity \"bump\" on the thermal stability and vertical\nstructure of radiation pressure dominated accretion disks, utilizing three\ndimensional radiation magneto-hydrodynamic simulations in the local shearing\nbox approximation. The simulations self-consistently calculate the heating due\nto MHD turbulence caused by magneto-rotational instability and radiative\ncooling by using the radiative transfer module based on a variable Eddington\ntensor in Athena. For a $5\\times 10^8$ solar mass black hole with $\\sim 3\\%$ of\nthe Eddington luminosity, a model including the iron opacity bump maintains its\nstructure for more than $10$ thermal times without showing significant signs of\nthermal runaway. In contrast, if only electron scattering and free-free opacity\nare included as in the standard thin disk model, the disk collapses on the\nthermal time scale. The difference is caused by a combination of 1) an\nanti-correlation between the total optical depth and the temperature, and 2)\nenhanced vertical advective energy transport.

First, our deep time-domain observations with the Arecibo\ntelescope failed to uncover the putative pulsar powering the proposed PWN.

Our\nmethod relies on a systematic classification of renormalisable single-mediator\nmodels for dark matter-quark interactions, and is valid for dark matter\ncandidates of spin less than or equal to one. Applying our method to simulated\ndata, we find that at the end of the LHC Run 3 only two mutually exclusive\nscenarios would be compatible with the detection of $\\mathcal{O}(100)$ signal\nevents at XENONnT. In a first scenario, the energy distribution of the signal\nevents is featureless, as for canonical spin-independent interactions. In this\ncase, if a mono-jet signal is detected at the LHC, dark matter must have spin\n1/2 and interact with nucleons through a unique velocity-dependent operator. If\na mono-jet signal is not detected, dark matter interacts with nucleons through\ncanonical spin-independent interactions. In a second scenario, the spectral\ndistribution of the signal events exhibits a bump at non zero recoil energies.\nIn this second case, a mono-jet signal can be detected at the LHC Run 3, dark\nmatter must have spin 1/2 and interact with nucleons through a unique\nmomentum-dependent operator.

In this\npaper, we explore an alternative scenario assuming that the pulsar responsible\nfor the formation of the nebula initially had a very short rotation period. In\nthis case, the sizes of both the PWN and the surrounding supernova remnant\ndepend on the initial pulsar period, the braking index, and the ISM density. To\ncheck the feasibility of this scenario, we study the parameter space that would\nreproduce the size of HESS J1825-137. We show that this demand can be achieved\nif the braking index is small, $n\\leq2$ and the pulsar birth period is short,\n$P_{\\rm b}\\simeq1\\rm\\,ms$. This scenario can reproduce the wind termination\nposition, which is expected at $R_{ts}\\simeq0.03\\rm\\,pc$, only in a dense\nenvironment with $n_{ism}\\geq\\rm1\\,cm^{-3}$. The requirement of the dense\nsurrounding gas is supported by the presence of molecular clouds found in the\nsource vicinity. \n\n"}

Assuming\nthe initially narrow (classical-like) standard deviations for the an- gle and\nthe angular momentum of the rotator, we investigate dynamics of the first and\nsecond moments depending on the size, i.e., on the number of blades of both the\nfree rotator as well as of the rotator in the external har- monic field.

It features an explicit\nmatter-antimatter asymmetry generation mechanism, has one fully worked out\nthermal history and suggestions for other possibilities, and meets all\nphenomenological, cosmological and astrophysical constraints. Importantly, it\nincorporates a deep reason for why the dark matter mass scale is related to the\nproton mass, a key consideration in ADM models. Our starting point is the idea\nof mirror matter, which offers an explanation for dark matter by duplicating\nthe standard model with a dark sector related by a $Z_2$ parity symmetry.\nHowever, the dark sector need not manifest as a symmetric copy of the standard\nmodel in the present day. By utilising the mechanism of \"asymmetric symmetry\nbreaking\" with two Higgs doublets in each sector, we develop a model of ADM\nwhere the mirror symmetry is spontaneously broken, leading to an electroweak\nscale in the dark sector that is significantly larger than that of the visible\nsector. The weak sensitivity of the ordinary and dark QCD confinement scales to\ntheir respective electroweak scales leads to the necessary connection between\nthe dark matter and proton masses. The dark matter is composed of either dark\nneutrons or a mixture of dark neutrons and metastable dark hydrogen atoms.\nLepton asymmetries are generated by the $CP$-violating decays of heavy Majorana\nneutrinos in both sectors. These are then converted by sphaleron processes to\nproduce the observed ratio of visible to dark matter in the universe. The\ndynamics responsible for the kinetic decoupling of the two sectors emerges as\nan important issue that we only partially solve. \n\n"}

To understand how black hole mass affects the duration of\nsuper-Eddington accretion in tidal disruption events, we first run a suite of\nsimulations of the disruption of a Solar-like star by a supermassive black hole\nof varying mass to directly measure the fallback rate onto the hole, and we\ncompare these fallback rates to the analytic predictions of the \"frozen-in\"\nmodel.

While the formation of large scale structure is\nindependent of the nature of the cold dark matter (CDM), the fate of\ninhomogeneities on sub-galactic scales, and hence the present day CDM\ndistribution on these scales, depends on the micro-physics of the CDM\nparticles. We study the density contrast of Weakly Interacting Massive\nParticles (WIMPs) on sub-galactic scales. We calculate the damping of the\nprimordial power spectrum due to collisional damping and free-streaming of\nWIMPy CDM and show that free-streaming leads to a CDM power spectrum with a\nsharp cut-off at about $10^{-6} M_\\odot$. We also calculate the transfer\nfunction for the growth of the inhomogeneities in the linear regime, taking\ninto account the suppression in the growth of the CDM density contrast after\nmatter-radiation equality due to baryons and show that our analytic results are\nin good agreement with numerical calculations.

This formula is a generalization of the well-known eikonal formula,\nto non-abelian interactions. It expresses the amplitude as a sum of products of\nirreducible amplitudes, with each irreducible amplitude being the amplitude to\nemit one, or several mutually interacting, quasi-particles. For abelian\ninteraction a quasi-particle is nothing but the original boson, so this\ndecomposition formula reduces to the eikonal formula. In non-abelian situations\neach quasi-particle can be made up of many bosons, though always with a total\nquantum number identical to that of a single boson. This decomposition enables\ncertain amplitudes of all orders to be summed up into an exponential form, and\nit allows subleading contributions of a certain kind, which is difficult to\nreach in the usual way, to be computed. For bosonic emissions from a heavy\nsource with many constituents, a quasi-particle amplitude turns out to be an\namplitude in which all bosons are emitted from the same constituent. For\nhigh-energy parton-parton scattering in the near-forward direction, the\nquasi-particle turns out to be the Reggeon, and this formalism shows clearly\nwhy gluons reggeize but photons do not. The ablility to compute subleading\nterms in this formalism allows the BFKL-Pomeron amplitude to be extrapolated to\nasymptotic energies, in a unitary way preserving the Froissart bound. We also\nconsider recoil corrections for abelian interactions in order to accommodate\nthe Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal effect. \n\n"}

We also evaluated\nRenyi and Tsallis entropies of the subsystem. We represented the entropy in\nterms of a Toeplitz determinant and calculated the asymptotic analytically. \n\n"}
