When $\\alpha<1/2$, the RDE will exhibit a quintom feature, i.e., the\nequation of state of dark energy will evolve across the cosmological constant\nboundary $w=-1$. Observations show that the parameter $\\alpha$ is indeed\nsmaller than 1/2, so the late-time evolution of RDE will be really like a\nphantom energy. Therefore, it seems that the big rip is inevitable in this\nmodel. On the other hand, the big rip is actually inconsistent with the\ntheoretical framework of the holographic model of dark energy. To avoid the big\nrip, we appeal to the extra dimension physics. In this Letter, we investigate\nthe cosmological evolution of the RDE in the braneworld cosmology. It is of\ninterest to find that for the far future evolution of RDE in a Randall-Sundrum\nbraneworld, there is an attractor solution where the steady state (de Sitter)\nfinale occurs, in stead of the big rip. \n\n"}

To avoid using\na jet veto, one can consider inclusive observables, in which every particle is\nin a jet. We demonstrate that calculating the mass of the hardest jet in\nmultijet events can be problematic, and we give an example of an inclusive\nobservable, asymmetric thrust, which can be resummed to next-to-next-to-leading\nlogarithmic accuracy. Exclusive observables with out-of-jet regions are more\ncomplicated.

However, the non-trivial structure of\nthe standard-model Yukawa couplings hints at some underlying flavor theory,\nwhich would necessarily control the sizes of the matter-messenger couplings as\nwell. Thus for example, if the doublet messenger and the Higgs have the same\nproperties under the flavor theory, the resulting messenger-lepton couplings\nare parametrically of the same order as the lepton Yukawas, so that slepton\nmass-splittings are similar to those of minimally-flavor-violating models and\ntherefore satisfy bounds on flavor-violation, with, however, slepton mixings\nthat are potentially large.

In experiments with fine energy\nresolution, such as many $0\\nu 2\\beta$ decay experiments, this motivates a\nhighly model-independent search for the sidereal daily modulation of an\nunexpected $\\gamma$ line. Such a signal arises from two-step WIMP interaction:\nthe WIMP is first excited in the lead shielding and subsequently decays back to\nthe ground state via the emission of a monochromatic $\\gamma$ within the\ndetector volume. We explore this idea in detail by considering the model of\nmagnetic inelastic WIMPs, and take a sequence of CUORE-type detectors as an\nexample. We find that under reasonable assumptions about detector performance\nit is possible to efficiently explore mass splittings of up to few hundreds of\nkeV for a WIMP of weak-scale mass and transitional magnetic moments.

They\nrepresent a unique probe for high-density matter because the oscillations are\ndetectable via gravitational-wave measurements and are strongly dependent on\nthe equation of state. The impact of the equation of state is apparent in the\nfrequency of the dominant oscillation mode of the remnant. For a fixed total\nbinary mass a tight relation between the dominant postmerger frequency and the\nradii of nonrotating neutron stars exists. Inferring observationally the\ndominant postmerger frequency thus determines neutron star radii with high\naccuracy of the order of a few hundred meters. By considering symmetric and\nasymmetric binaries of the same chirp mass, we show that the knowledge of the\nbinary mass ratio is not critical for this kind of radius measurements. We\nsummarize different possibilities to deduce the maximum mass of nonrotating\nneutron stars. We clarify the nature of the three most prominent features of\nthe postmerger gravitational-wave spectrum and argue that the merger remnant\ncan be considered to be a single, isolated, self-gravitating object that can be\ndescribed by concepts of asteroseismology. The understanding of the different\nmechanisms shaping the gravitational-wave signal yields a physically motivated\nanalytic model of the gravitational-wave emission, which may form the basis for\ntemplate-based gravitational-wave data analysis. We explore the observational\nconsequences of a scenario of two families of compact stars including hadronic\nand quark stars.

We use this observation to\nplace constraints on the density profile of dwarf spheroidal galaxies under the\nassumption that the galactic center excess is in fact a signal from\nannihilating dark matter. We place constraints on the generalized NFW parameter\n$\\gamma$ and the Einasto profile parameter $\\alpha$ which control the\nlogarithmic slope of the inner regions of the halo's density profile.

This\ncoupling results in explosive gauge field production during inflation,\nespecially at its last stage, which has interesting phenomenological\nconsequences: For one thing, the primordial hypermagnetic field is maximally\nhelical. It is thus capable of sourcing the generation of nonzero baryon\nnumber, via the standard model chiral anomaly, around the time of electroweak\nsymmetry breaking. For another thing, the gauge field production during\ninflation feeds back into the primordial tensor power spectrum, leaving an\nimprint in the stochastic background of gravitational waves (GWs). In this\npaper, we focus on the correlation between these two phenomena. Working in the\napproximation of instant reheating, we (1) update the investigation of\nbaryogenesis via hypermagnetic fields from pseudoscalar inflation and (2)\nexamine the corresponding implications for the GW spectrum.

A recent lattice QCD calculation of the nucleon\nstrange quark form factor predicts that the strange quark distribution is more\ncentralized in coordinate space than the antistrange quark distribution, and\nthus the strange quark distribution is more spread out in light-front momentum\nspace. We show that the lattice prediction implies that the difference between\nthe strange and antistrange parton distribution functions, $s(x)-\\bar{s}(x)$,\nis negative at small-$x$ and positive at large-$x$. We also evaluate the\nstrange quark form factor and $s(x)-\\bar{s}(x)$ using a baryon-meson\nfluctuation model and a novel nonperturbative model based on light-front\nholographic QCD.

Abstract: We propose that relativistic Galactic jets like those observed in GRS\n1915+105 and GRO J1655-40 may produce small but measurable contributions to the\ncosmic ray (CR) spectrum. If these jets contain cold protons and heavy ions (as\nin SS433), it is plausible that this component will consist of a narrow\nspectral feature, with a mean particle energy corresponding roughly to the bulk\nkinetic particle energy in the beam, Gamma_jet m c^2, which, based on current\nestimates of Gamma_jet, falls into the range of 3-10 GeV. The presence of\nseveral sources with different Gamma_jet will lead to superposition of several\nsuch peaks. Additionally, diffusive particle acceleration should produce a\npowerlaw whose low energy cutoff at or above Gamma_jet^2 m c^2 would be visible\nas another spectral feature. The large metallicities measured in several\nmicroquasar companions suggest that this CR component could have an anomalous\ncomposition compared to the bulk Galactic CRs. We provide estimates of the\neffects of adiabatic losses, which pose the greatest challenge to models of\nnarrow band CR production in microquasar jets. While the total energy contained\nin the microquasar CR component is highly uncertain, the CR spectrum in the\nvicinity of microquasars would be severely affected. AMS02 will be able to\nprobe the low energy CR spectrum for such components and composition anomalies.\nThe spectrally peculiar gamma-ray emission produced by interaction of the ISM\nwith CRs surrounding microquasars might be detectable by GLAST. If the presence\nof a microquasar CR proton component can be ruled out observationally, this\nargument could be turned around in favor of electron-positron jets. We show\nthat existing OSSE/GRO and future INTEGRAL data on the Galactic 511 keV line\nflux put interesting constraints on the particle content of microquasar jets. \n\n"}

{"id": "hep-ph/0204277", "contents": "Title: Perturbative Saturation and the Soft Pomeron Abstract: We show that perturbation theory provides two distinct mechanisms for the\npower like growth of hadronic cross sections at high energy. One, the leading\nBFKL effect is due to the growth of the parton density, and is characterized by\nthe leading BFKL exponent. The other mechanism is due to the infrared\ndiffusion, or the long range nature of the Coulomb field of perturbatively\nmassless gluons. When perturbative saturation effects are taken into account,\nthe first mechanism is rendered ineffective but the second one persists. We\nsuggest that these two distinct mechanisms are responsible for the appearance\nof two pomerons. The density growth effects are responsible for the hard\npomeron and manifest themselves in small systems (e.g. gamma^* or small size\nfluctuations in the proton wave function) where saturation effects are not\nimportant. The soft pomeron is the manifestation of the exponential growth of\nthe black saturated regions which appear in typical hadronic systems. We point\nout that the nonlinear generalization of the BFKL equation which takes into\naccount wave function saturation effects (\"pomeron loops\") provides a well\ndefined perturbative framework for the calculation of the soft pomeron\nintercept. The conjecture of a perturbative soft pomeron is consistent with\npicturing the proton as a loosely bound system of several small black regions\ncorresponding e.g. to constituent quarks of size about 0.3 fm.

The main ingredients in our analysis are the identification of a\nspecial Green's function, which serves as a common kernel to all self-energy\nand vertex diagrams, and the judicious use of the Slavnov-Taylor identity it\nsatisfies. In particular, it is shown that the ghost-Green's functions\nappearing in this identity capture precisely the result of the pinching action\nat arbitrary order. By virtue of this observation the construction of the\nquark-gluon vertex becomes particularly compact. It turns out that the\naforementioned ghost-Green's functions play a crucial role, their net effect\nbeing the non-trivial modification of the ghost diagrams of the quark-gluon\nvertex in such a way as to reproduce dynamically the characteristic ghost\nsector of the background field method.

Abstract: We rewiew and scrutinize the existing mass determinations of the pentaquarks\nfrom the exponential Laplace Sum Rules (LSR). We do not find any sum rule\nwindow for extracting optimal and reliable results from the LSR, due to the\nunusual slow convergence of the OPE and to the exceptional important role of\nthe QCD continuum into the spectral function in this channel. Instead, we use\nin this channel,for the first time, Finite Energy Sum Rules (FESR), which\nexhibit a nice stability in the QCD continuum threshold t_c, at which one can\nextract, with a good accuracy, the mass of the lowest resonance. Including the\nD=7, 9 condensate contributions in the OPE, we obtain M_Theta=(1513+- 114) MeV,\nand the corresponding residue lambda_Theta^2= -(0.14-- 0.49)x 10^{-9} GeV^{12},\nwhich favours the I=0, J=1/2, and negative parity S-wave interpretation of the\nTheta (1540).

This background is locally\nanti-de Sitter spacetime with non-vanishing torsion. Conformal invariance is\nexpressed as the torsion being parallelized. The precise effect of the\nconformal invariance on the dynamics of both circular and generic classical\nstrings is extracted. In particular, the conformal invariance gives rise to a\nrepulsive interaction of the string with the background which precisely cancels\nthe dominant attractive term arising from gravity. We perform both\nsemi-classical and canonical string-quantization, in order to see the effect of\nthe conformal invariance of the background on the string mass spectrum. Both\napproaches yield that the high-mass states are governed by m sim HN (N,`large\ninteger'), where m is the string mass and H is the Hubble constant. It follows\nthat the level spacing grows proportionally to N: d(m^2 alpha')/dN sim N, while\nthe entropy goes like: S sim sqrt{m}. Moreover, it follows that there is no\nHagedorn temperature,so that the partition function is well defined at any\npositive temperature. All results are compared with the analogue results in\nAnti- de Sitter spacetime, which is a non conformal invariant background.\nConformal invariance simplifies the mathematics of the problem but the physics\nremains mainly unchanged. Differences between conformal and non-conformal\nbackgrounds only appear in the intermediate region of the string spectrum, but\nthese differences are minor. For low and high masses, the string mass spectra\nin conformal and non-conformal backgrounds are identical. Interestingly enough,\nconformal invariance fixes the value of the spacetime curvature to be -69/(26\nalpha'). \n\n"}

One description considered is that of\npentaquarks which consist of a diquark coupled to a triquark.
