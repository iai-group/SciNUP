Different analysis methods have been proposed for this purpose, but so\nfar, no comparative test has been performed to test their validity. We\ncalculated model spectra of disk models with different geometries and central\nsources, using a 2D radiative transfer code. These spectra were then fitted in\na blind test using four different spectral decomposition methods. We studied\nthe effect of disk structure (flared vs. flat), inclination angle, size of the\ninner disk hole and stellar luminosity on the fitted chemical composition. Our\nresults show that the derived dust compositions by all methods deviate\nsystematically from the real chemical composition. Out of the four tested\nspectral decomposition methods, our new two-layer temperature distribution\nmethod, differs the least from the input dust composition and the results show\nthe weakest systematic effects. The reason for the deviations of the results\ngiven by other methods lies in their simplifying assumptions (e.g. single\naverage grain temperature or one component continuum).

Traditional N-body simulations of multiple-planet systems without\ngas disks have successfully reproduced the eccentricity (e) distribution of the\nobserved systems, by assuming that the planetary systems are relatively closely\npacked when the gas disk dissipates, so that they become dynamically unstable\nwithin the stellar lifetime. However, such studies cannot explain the small\nsemi-major axes (a) of extrasolar planetary systems, if planets are formed, as\nthe standard planet formation theory suggests, beyond the ice line.\n  In this paper, we numerically study the evolution of three-planet systems in\ndissipating gas disks, and constrain the initial conditions that reproduce the\nobserved semi-major axis and eccentricity distributions simultaneously. We\nadopt the initial conditions that are motivated by the standard planet\nformation theory, and self-consistently simulate the disk evolution, and planet\nmigration by using a hybrid N-body and 1D gas disk code. We also take account\nof eccentricity damping, and investigate the effect of saturation of corotation\nresonances on the evolution of planetary systems. We find that the semi-major\naxis distribution is largely determined in a gas disk, while the eccentricity\ndistribution is determined after the disk dissipation.

Our\nsimulations generate a larger fraction of planetary systems trapped in\nmean-motion resonances (MMRs) than the observations, indicating that the disk's\nperturbation to the planetary orbits may be important to explain the observed\nrate of MMRs.

This will allow the detection of gravitational waves\ngenerated in binary systems containing black holes of intermediate mass, ~\n100-1000 solar masses.

IMBHs may form via two channels: (i) in\ndark matter halos at high redshift through direct collapse or the collapse of\nvery massive metal-poor Population III stars, or (ii) via runaway stellar\ncollisions in globular clusters.

We investigate\nthe precision that can be achieved in radial velocity measurements of low mass\nstars in the near infrared (nIR) Y-, J-, and H-bands, and we compare it to the\nprecision achievable in the optical. For early-M stars, radial velocity\nmeasurements in the nIR offer no or only marginal advantage in comparison to\noptical measurements. Although they emit more flux in the nIR, the richness of\nspectral features in the optical outweighs the flux difference. We find that\nnIR measurement can be as precise than optical measurements in stars of\nspectral type ~M4, and from there the nIR gains in precision towards cooler\nobjects. We studied potential calibration strategies in the nIR finding that a\nstable spectrograph with a ThAr calibration can offer enough wavelength\nstability for m/s precision. Furthermore, we simulate the wavelength-dependent\ninfluence of activity (cool spots) on radial velocity measurements from optical\nto nIR wavelengths. Our spot simulations reveal that the radial velocity jitter\ndoes not decrease as dramatically towards longer wavelengths as often thought.\nThe jitter strongly depends on the details of the spots, i.e., on spot\ntemperature and the spectral appearance of the spot. Forthcoming nIR\nspectrographs will allow the search for planets with a particular advantage in\nmid- and late-M stars.

In particular, the power of\nthe quadrupole moment of the CMB fluctuations is remarkably low, and the\nquadrupole and octopole moments are aligned mutually and with the geometry of\nthe Solar system. It has been suggested in the literature that microwave sky\npollution by an unidentified dust cloud in the vicinity of the Solar system may\nbe the cause for these anomalies. In this paper, we simulate the thermal\nemission by clouds of spherical homogeneous particles of several materials.\nSpectral constraints from the WMAP multi-wavelength data and earlier infrared\nobservations on the hypothetical dust cloud are used to determine the dust\ncloud's physical characteristics. In order for its emissivity to demonstrate a\nflat, CMB-like wavelength dependence over the WMAP wavelengths (3 through 14\nmm), and to be invisible in the infrared light, its particles must be\nmacroscopic. Silicate spheres from several millimetres in size and carbonaceous\nparticles an order of magnitude smaller will suffice. According to our\nestimates of the abundance of such particles in the Zodiacal cloud and\ntrans-neptunian belt, yielding the optical depths of the order of 1E-7 for each\ncloud, the Solar-system dust can well contribute 10 microKelvin (within an\norder of magnitude) in the microwaves. This is not only intriguingly close to\nthe magnitude of the anomalies (about 30 microKelvin), but also alarmingly\nabove the presently believed magnitude of systematic biases of the WMAP results\n(below 5 microKelvin) and, to an even greater degree, of the future missions\nwith higher sensitivities, e.g. PLANCK. \n\n"}

We argue that hot Jupiter\natmospheres, with possibly fast (sonic) wind speeds, may require a more\nstrongly coupled treatment, formally in the regime of radiation-hydrodynamics.\nTo lowest order in v/c, relativistic Doppler shifts distort line profiles along\noptical paths with finite wind velocity gradients. This leads to flow-dependent\ndeviations in the effective emission and absorption properties of the\natmospheric medium. Evaluating the overall impact of these distortions on the\nradiative structure of a dynamic atmosphere is non-trivial. We present\ntransmissivity and systematic equivalent width excess calculations which\nsuggest possibly important consequences for radiation transport in hot Jupiter\natmospheres.

Internal two-body relaxation and external shocks will lead to\nfurther, gradual dissolution on timescales of up to a few hundred million years\nfor low-mass open clusters in the Milky Way, while the most massive clusters (>\n10^5 Msun) have lifetimes comparable to or exceeding the age of the Universe.\nThe low-mass end of the initial cluster mass function is well approximated by a\npower-law distribution, dN/dM ~ M^{-2}, but there is mounting evidence that\nquiescent spiral discs form relatively few clusters with masses M > 2 x 10^5\nMsun.

We highlight that this\nresult would have profound consequences for both eternal inflation and the\npredictivity of standard inflation. We find a different result. We consider two\nsets of theories: one where the inflaton has a large cubic self-interaction and\none where the inflaton interacts gravitationally with N massless spectator\nscalar fields. We find that there is a logarithmic running but of the form\nlog(H/mu), where H is the Hubble constant during inflation.

In one set of simulations solenoidal forcing is applied,\nwhile the second set uses purely compressive forcing to excite turbulent\nmotions. From the resulting density field, we compute the mass distribution of\ngravitationally unstable cores by means of a clump-finding algorithm. Using the\ntime-averaged probability density functions of the mass density, semi-analytic\nmass distributions are calculated from analytical theories. We apply stability\ncriteria that are based on the Bonnor-Ebert mass resulting from the thermal\npressure and from the sum of thermal and turbulent pressure. Although there are\nuncertainties in the application of the clump-finding algorithm, we find\nsystematic differences in the mass distributions obtained from solenoidal and\ncompressive forcing. Compressive forcing produces a shallower slope in the\nhigh-mass power-law regime compared to solenoidal forcing. The mass\ndistributions also depend on the Jeans length resulting from the choice of the\nmass in the computational box, which is freely scalable for non-selfgravitating\nisothermal turbulence.

Mass is the most important parameter\nof a planet and can only be measured by observing the motion of the star around\nthe planet-star center of mass. A single image of a planet, however, does not\nprovide evidence that the planet is Earth mass or that it is in a habitable\nzone orbit. The planet's orbit, however, can be measured either by imaging the\nplanet at multiple epochs or by measuring the position of the star at multiple\nepochs by space-based astrometry. The measurement of an exo-planet's orbit by\ndirect imaging is complicated by a number of factors: (1) the inner working\nangle (IWA); (2) the apparent brightness of the planet depending on the orbital\nphase; (3) confusion arising from the presence of multiple planets; and (4) the\nplanet-star contrast.

So\nfar, UV transit observations have led to the detection of atomic hydrogen,\noxygen and ionized carbon in the upper atmosphere of HD209458b. The\ninterpretation of these observations is controversial - it is not clear if the\nabsorption arises from an escaping atmosphere interacting with the stellar\nradiation and stellar wind, or the thermosphere inside the Roche lobe. Here we\nintroduce an empirical model that can be used to analyze UV transit depths of\nextrasolar planets and use it to interpret the transits of HD209458b in the H\nLy alpha and the OI triplet emission lines. The results indicate that the mean\ntemperature of the thermosphere is 8,000-11,000 K and that the H2/H\ndissociation front is located at pressures between 0.1-1 microbar, which\ncorrespond to an altitude of 1.1 Rp. The upper boundary of the model\nthermosphere is located at altitudes between 2.7-3 Rp, above which the\natmosphere is mostly ionized.

By assuming a solar mixing ratio\nof oxygen, we obtain an OI transit depth that is statistically consistent with\nthe observations. An OI transit depth comparable to or slightly larger than the\nHI transit depth is possible if the atmosphere is undergoing fast hydrodynamic\nescape, the O/H ratio is supersolar, or if a significant quantity of neutral\noxygen is found outside the Roche lobe.

In the simulations, a weak vertical uniform magnetic\nfield is imposed in a region of fully developed granular convection; and the\ntotal magnetic flux through the top and bottom boundaries is kept constant. The\nsimulation results reveal a process of spontaneous formation of stable magnetic\nstructures, which may be a key to understanding of the magnetic\nself-organization on the Sun and formation of pores and sunspots. This process\nconsists of two basic steps: 1) formation of small-scale filamentary magnetic\nstructures associated with concentrations of vorticity and whirlpool-type\nmotions, and 2) merging of these structures due to the vortex attraction,\ncaused by converging downdrafts around magnetic concentration below the\nsurface.

Our parameter study explores how the emergent luminosity depends on a\nrange of circumstellar shell masses, velocities, geometries, and wind mass-loss\nrates, as well as variations in the SN mass and energy. We find that the shell\nmass is the most important parameter, in the sense that higher shell masses (or\nhigher ratios of M_shell/M_SN) lead to higher peak luminosities and higher\nefficiencies in converting shock energy into visual light. Lower mass shells\ncan also cause high peak luminosities if the shell is slow or if the SN ejecta\nare very fast, but only for a short time. Sustaining a high luminosity for\ndurations of more than 100 days requires massive circumstellar shells of order\n10 M_sun or more.

Following the collapse from\nthe prestellar phase allows us to model the early embedded phase of disk\nformation and evolution. During this time, the disk is susceptible to\nfragmentation, depending upon the properties of the initial prestellar core.\nGlobally, we find that higher initial core angular momentum and mass content\nfavors more fragmentation, but higher levels of background radiation can\nmoderate the tendency to fragment. A higher rate of mass infall onto the disk\nthan that onto the star is a necessary but not sufficient condition for disk\nfragmentation.

Compared\nto its twins, the Sun exhibits a deficiency of refractory elements (those with\ncondensation temperatures Tc>900K) relative to volatiles (Tc<900K). This\nfinding is speculated to be a signature of the planet formation that occurred\nmore efficiently around the Sun compared with the majority of solar twins.\nFurthermore, within this scenario, it seems more likely that the abundance\npatterns found are specifically related to the formation of terrestrial\nplanets. In this work we analyze abundance results from six large independent\nstellar abundance surveys to determine whether they confirm or reject this\nobservational finding. We show that the elemental abundances derived for solar\nanalogs in these six studies are consistent with the Tc trend suggested as a\nplanet formation signature. The same conclusion is reached when those results\nare averaged heterogeneously. We also investigate the dependency of the\nabundances with first ionization potential (FIP), which correlates well with\nTc.

We have also considered the contribution that\ncrystalline dust grains will have in the wind and show that a photoevaporative\nwind can result in a significant crystallinity fraction at all radii, when the\ndisc is edge-on. However, when the disc's photosphere is unobscured, a\nphotoevaporative wind makes no contribution to the observable crystallinity\nfraction in the disc.

We also validate our\ntransmission code by demonstrating close agreement with analytic models that\nuse only Rayleigh scattering or water vapor opacity. We find broad disagreement\nwith radius variations predicted by another published model. For GJ 436b, the\nrelative coolness of the planet's atmosphere, along with its implied high\nmetallicity, may make it dissimilar in character compared to \"hot Jupiters.\"\nSome recent observational and modeling efforts suggest low relative abundances\nof H2O and CH4 present in GJ 436b's atmosphere, compared to calculations from\nequilibrium chemistry. We include these characteristics in our models and\nexamine the effects of absorption from methane-derived higher order\nhydrocarbons. Significant absorption from HCN and C2H2 are found throughout the\ninfrared, while C2H4 and C2H6 are less easily seen. We perform detailed\nsimulations of JWST observations, including all likely noise sources, and find\nthat we will be able to constrain chemical abundance regimes from this planet's\ntransmission spectrum.

This has been\nfollowed by a phase of even more rapid technological evolution and concomitant\nexpansion of the size of the population, that began when our own particular\n`sapiens' species emerged, just a few hundred thousand years ago. The present\ninvestigation exploits the analogy between the neo-Darwinian genetic evolution\nmechanism governing the first phase, and the memetic evolution mechanism\ngoverning the second phase. From the outset of the latter until very recently\n-- about the year 2000 -- the growth of the global population N was roughly\ngoverned by an equation of the form dN/Ndt= N/T*, in which T* is a coefficient\nintroduced (in 1960) by von Foerster, who evaluated it empirically as about two\nhundred thousand million years.

Model and analysis Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is commonly considered as a mechanism of solar\n(eruptive) flares. A deeper study of this scenario reveals, however, a number\nof open issues. Among them is the fundamental question, how the magnetic energy\nis transferred from large, accumulation scales to plasma scales where its\nactual dissipation takes place. In order to investigate this transfer over a\nbroad range of scales we address this question by means of a high-resolution\nMHD simulation. The simulation results indicate that the magnetic-energy\ntransfer to small scales is realized via a cascade of consecutive smaller and\nsmaller flux-ropes (plasmoids), in analogy with the vortex-tube cascade in\n(incompressible) fluid dynamics. Both tearing and (driven) \"fragmenting\ncoalescence\" processes are equally important for the consecutive fragmentation\nof the magnetic field (and associated current density) to smaller elements. At\nthe later stages a dynamic balance between tearing and coalescence processes\nreveals a steady (power-law) scaling typical for cascading processes. It is\nshown that cascading reconnection also addresses other open issues in solar\nflare research such as the duality between the regular large-scale picture of\n(eruptive) flares and the observed signatures of fragmented (chaotic) energy\nrelease, as well as the huge number of accelerated particles. Indeed,\nspontaneous current-layer fragmentation and formation of multiple channelised\ndissipative/acceleration regions embedded in the current layer appears to be\nintrinsic to the cascading process. The multiple small-scale current sheets may\nalso facilitate the acceleration of a large number of particles. The structure,\ndistribution and dynamics of the embedded potential acceleration regions in a\ncurrent layer fragmented by cascading reconnection are studied and discussed. \n\n"}

We consider a wide range of cloudy and cloud-free models. The cloudy\nmodels incorporate different geometrical and optical thicknesses, modal\nparticle sizes, and metallicities. For each planet and set of cloud parameters,\nwe explore grids in gravity and effective temperature, with which we determine\nconstraints on the planet's mass and age. Our new models yield statistically\nsignificant fits to the data, and conclusively confirm that the HR 8799 planets\nhave much thicker clouds than those required to explain data for typical L and\nT dwarfs. Both models with 1) physically thick forsterite clouds and a\n60-micron modal particle size and 2) clouds made of 1 micron-sized pure iron\ndroplets and 1% supersaturation fit the data. Current data are insufficient to\naccurately constrain the microscopic cloud properties, such as composition and\nparticle size. The range of best-estimated masses for HR 8799b, HR 8799c, and\nHR 8799d conservatively span 2-12 M_J, 6-13 M_J, and 3-11 M_J, respectively and\nimply coeval ages between ~10 and ~150 Myr, consistent with previously reported\nstellar age. The best-fit temperatures and gravities are slightly lower than\nvalues obtained by Currie et al.

Our models predict that planet-mass objects follow a locus in\nsome near-to-mid IR color-magnitude diagrams that is clearly separable from the\nstandard L/T dwarf locus for field brown dwarfs. \n\n"}

Laboratory experiments have shown that dust\naggregates of these sizes stick to one another only at unreasonably low\nvelocities. However, in the protoplanetary disk, millimeter-sized particles are\nknown to have been ubiquitous. One can find relics of them in the form of solid\nchondrules as the main constituent of chondrites. Most of these chondrules were\nfound to feature a fine-grained rim, which is hypothesized to have formed from\naccreting dust grains in the solar nebula. To study the influence of these\ndust-coated chondrules on the formation of chondrites and possibly\nplanetesimals, we conducted collision experiments between millimeter-sized,\ndust-coated chondrule analogs at velocities of a few cm/s. For 2 and 3 mm\ndiameter chondrule analogs covered by dusty rims of a volume filling factor of\n0.18 and 0.35-0.58, we found sticking velocities of a few cm/s.

We\ntherefore conclude that chondrules may be an important step towards a deeper\nunderstanding of the collisional growth of larger bodies. Moreover, we analyzed\nthe collision behavior in an ensemble of dust aggregates and non-coated\nchondrule analogs. While neither the dust aggregates nor the solid chondrule\nanalogs show sticking in collisions among their species, we found an enhanced\nsicking efficiency in collisions between the two constituents, which leads us\nto the conjecture that chondrules might act as \"catalyzers\" for the growth of\nlarger bodies in the young Solar System. \n\n"}

The method known as\n\"the MacDonald torque\" is often combined with an assumption that the quality\nfactor Q is frequency-independent. This makes the method inconsistent, because\nthe MacDonald theory tacitly fixes the rheology by making Q scale as the\ninverse tidal frequency.\n  Spin-orbit coupling can be treated also in an approach called \"the Darwin\ntorque\". While this theory is general enough to accommodate an arbitrary\nfrequency-dependence of Q, this advantage has not yet been exploited in the\nliterature, where Q is assumed constant or is set to scale as inverse tidal\nfrequency, the latter assertion making the Darwin torque equivalent to a\ncorrected version of the MacDonald torque.\n  However neither a constant nor an inverse-frequency Q reflect the properties\nof realistic mantles and crusts, because the actual frequency-dependence is\nmore complex. Hence the necessity to enrich the theory of spin-orbit\ninteraction with the right frequency-dependence. We accomplish this programme\nfor the Darwin-torque-based model near resonances. We derive the\nfrequency-dependence of the tidal torque from the first principles, i.e., from\nthe expression for the mantle's compliance in the time domain. We also explain\nthat the tidal torque includes not only the secular part, but also an\noscillating part.\n  We demonstrate that the lmpq term of the Darwin-Kaula expansion for the tidal\ntorque smoothly goes through zero, when the secondary traverses the lmpq\nresonance (e.g., the principal tidal torque smoothly goes through nil as the\nsecondary crosses the synchronous orbit).\n  We also offer a possible explanation for the unexpected frequency-dependence\nof the tidal dissipation rate in the Moon, discovered by LLR. \n\n"}

The asymmetry\nrequired in the thermal radiation field to produce polarization may arise\neither from the rotation-induced oblateness or from surface inhomogeneities,\nsuch as partial cloudiness.

We find that at J-H = 0.30 characteristic of solar-type\nstars, the average g-r color of stars that host giant ECs is 4-sigma redder\nthan the average color of the stars in the control sample. At the same time,\nthe average g-r color of solar-type stars that host small-radius ECs is\nindistinguishable from the average color of the stars in the control sample. In\naddition, we find that at J-H = 0.62 indicative of late K dwarfs, the average\ng-r color of stars that host small-radius ECs is 4-sigma redder than the\naverage color of the stars in the control sample. These offsets are unlikely to\nbe caused by differential reddening, age differences between the two\npopulations, or the presence of giant stars in the control sample. Stellar\nmodels suggest that the first color offset is due to a 0.2 dex enhancement in\n[Fe/H] of the giant EC host population at M_star = 1 M_Sun, while Sloan\nphotometry of M 67 and NGC 6791 suggests that the second color offset is due to\na similar [Fe/H] enhancement of the small-radius EC host population at M_star =\n0.7 M_Sun. These correlations are a natural consequence of the core-accretion\nmodel of planet formation. \n\n"}

The Milky Way galaxy is modelled using a\ncomputational approach by populating stars and their planetary systems on an\nindividual basis using Monte-Carlo methods. We begin with well-established\nproperties of the disk of the Milky Way, such as the stellar number density\ndistribution, the initial mass function, the star formation history, and the\nmetallicity gradient as a function of radial position and time. We vary some of\nthese properties, creating four models to test the sensitivity of our\nassumptions. To assess habitability on the Galactic scale, we model supernova\nrates, planet formation, and the time required for complex life to evolve. Our\nstudy improves on other literature on the GHZ by populating stars on an\nindividual basis and by modelling SNII and SNIa sterilizations by selecting\ntheir progenitors from within this preexisting stellar population. Furthermore,\nwe consider habitability on tidally locked and non-tidally locked planets\nseparately, and study habitability as a function of height above and below the\nGalactic midplane. In the model that most accurately reproduces the properties\nof the Galaxy, the results indicate that an individual SNIa is ~5.6 \\times more\nlethal than an individual SNII on average. In addition, we predict that ~1.2%\nof all stars host a planet that may have been capable of supporting complex\nlife at some point in the history of the Galaxy. Of those stars with a\nhabitable planet, ~75% of planets are predicted to be in a tidally locked\nconfiguration with their host star.

For this\npurpose we generate star cluster models with different degrees of mass\nsegregation and fractal substructure and analyse them. We quantify mass\nsegregation by measuring, from the projected 2d model data, the mass function\nslope in radial annuli, by looking for colour gradients in radial colour\nprofiles, by measuring Allison's Lambda parameter, and by determining the local\nstellar surface density around each star. We find that these methods for\nquantifying mass segregation often produce ambiguous results.

By taking a\ntypical comet moving along a highly eccentric and inclined orbit throughout the\nexpected entire extension of the Oort cloud (0.02 pc-1 pc), it turns out that\nthe addition of an outward Rindler-like acceleration, i.e. for A_Rin > 0, does\nnot allow bound orbits. Instead, if A_Rin < 0, the resulting numerically\nintegrated trajectory is limited in space, but it radically differs from the\nstandard Keplerian ellipse. In particular, the heliocentric distance of the\ncomet gets markedly reduced and experiences high frequency oscillations, its\nspeed is increased, and the overall pattern of the trajectory is quite\nisotropic.

Standard practice is to quantify the initial turbulent\nvelocity field in a core in terms of the amount of turbulent energy (or some\nequivalent) and the exponent in the power spectrum (n \\equiv -d log Pk /d log\nk). In this paper, we present a numerical study of the influence of the details\nof the turbulent velocity field on the collapse of an isolated, weakly\nturbulent, low-mass prestellar core. We show that, as long as n > 3 (as is\nusually assumed), a more critical parameter than n is the maximum wavelength in\nthe turbulent velocity field, {\\lambda}_MAX.

We calculated\nnova envelopes with one-dimensional approximation of the companion's effects\nand found that when the companion star is deeply embedded in the extended nova\nenvelope, the structure of static envelope approaches that of the optically\nthick wind solution. Thus, the transition from static to wind solution is\ntriggered by the effect of the companion. The transition occurs in a close\nbinary nova like V723 Cas, but is not triggered in a long period binary like PU\nVul. We reconfirm our previous results that the frictional energy deposition is\nnegligibly small in almost all of hydrogen/helium novae because of the low\nenvelope density at the orbit. \n\n"}

The NGC\n  6357 star-forming region Abstract: Dynamical few-body encounters in the dense cores of young massive star\nclusters are responsible for the loss of a significant fraction of their\nmassive stellar content. Some of the escaping (runaway) stars move through the\nambient medium supersonically and can be revealed via detection of their bow\nshocks (visible in the infrared, optical or radio). In this paper, which is the\nsecond of a series of papers devoted to the search for OB stars running away\nfrom young (several Myr) Galactic clusters and OB associations, we present the\nresults of the search for bow shocks around the star-forming region NGC 6357.\nUsing the archival data of the Midcourse Space Experiment (MSX) satellite and\nthe Spitzer Space Telescope, and the preliminary data release of the Wide-Field\nInfrared Survey Explorer (WISE), we discovered seven bow shocks, whose geometry\nis consistent with the possibility that they are generated by stars expelled\nfrom the young star clusters, Pismis 24 and AH03 J1725-34.4, associated with\nNGC 6357. Two of the seven bow shocks are driven by the already known O stars.\nFollow-up spectroscopy of three other bow shock-producing stars showed that\nthey are O-type stars as well, while the 2MASS photometry of the remaining two\nstars suggests that they could be B0 V stars, provided that both are located at\nthe same distance as NGC 6357. Detection of numerous massive stars ejected from\nthe very young clusters is consistent with the theoretical expectation that\nstar clusters can effectively lose massive stars at the very beginning of their\ndynamical evolution and lends strong support to the idea that probably all\nfield OB stars have been dynamically ejected from their birth clusters. A\nby-product of our search for bow shocks around NGC 6357 is the detection of\nthree circular shells typical of luminous blue variable and late WN-type\nWolf-Rayet stars. \n\n"}

In all, six gas emission lines (including Br gamma, Pa beta, and the\n0.8446 micron line of O I) along with continuum measurements made near the\nstandard J, H, K, and L photometric bands were measured. A mass accretion rate\nof approximately 2 x 10^-8 solar masses per year was derived from the Br gamma\nand Pa beta lines. However, the fluxes of these lines varied by a factor of\nover two during the course of a few months. The continuum also varied, but by\nonly ~30%, and even decreased at a time when the gas emission was increasing.\nThe H I line at 1.083 microns was also found to vary in a manner inconsistent\nwith that of either the hydrogen lines or the dust. Both the gas and dust\nvariabilities indicate significant changes in the region of the inner gas and\nthe inner dust belt that may be common to many young disk systems. If planets\nare responsible for defining the inner edge of the gap, they could interact\nwith the material on time scales commensurate with what is observed for the\nvariations in the dust, while other disk instabilities (thermal,\nmagnetorotational) would operate there on longer time scales than we observe\nfor the inner dust belt. For SAO 206462, the orbital period would likely be 1-3\nyears. If the changes are being induced in the disk material closer to the star\nthan the gap, a variety of mechanisms (disk instabilities, interactions via\nplanets) might be responsible for the changes seen. The He I feature is most\nlikely due to a wind whose orientation changes with respect to the observer on\ntime scales of a day or less.

Our SOPHIE spectra of Kepler-17b, used both to measure the\nradial-velocity variations and determine the atmospheric parameters of the host\nstar, allow us to refine the characterisation of the planetary system. In\nparticular we found the radial-velocity semi-amplitude and the stellar mass to\nbe respectively slightly smaller and larger than Desert et al.

The first model\nis a ring of polar orbits that move in a plane perpendicular to the binary\npericenter direction. We favour this interpretation because it includes the\neffect of secular perturbations and the disk can survive for Gyr timescales.\nThe second model is a misaligned ring. Because there is an ambiguity in the\norientation of the ring, which could be reflected in the sky plane, this ring\neither has near-polar orbits similar to the first model, or has a 30 degree\nmisalignment.

Another method, employed both in planetary science\nand astrophysics, is based on decomposition of each harmonic of the tide into\ntwo bulges oriented orthogonally to one another.\n  We prove that the two methods are equivalent. Specifically, we demonstrate\nthat the two-bulge method is not a separate approximation, but ensues directly\nfrom the Fourier expansion of a linear tidal theory equipped with an arbitrary\nrheological model involving a departure from elasticity. To this end, we use\nthe most general mathematical formalism applicable to linear bodily tides. To\nexpress the tidal amendment to the potential of the perturbed primary, we act\non the tide-raising potential of the perturbing secondary with a convolution\noperator. This enables us to interconnect a complex Fourier component of the\ntidally generated potential of the perturbed primary with the appropriate\ncomplex Fourier component of the tide-raising potential of the secondary. Then\nwe demonstrate how this interrelation entails the two-bulge description.\n  While less economical mathematically, the two-bulge approach has a good\nillustrative power, and may be employed on a par with a more concise method of\ncomplex amplitudes. At the same time, there exist situations where the\ntwo-bulge method becomes more practical for technical calculations. \n\n"}

We construct the evolutionary tracks of growing\nplanets at planet traps in evolving protoplanetary disks and show that they\nprovide a good physical understanding of how these observational properties\narise. The fundamental feature of our model is that inhomogeneities in\nprotoplanetary disks give rise to multiple (up to 3) trapping sites for rapid\n(type I) planetary migration of planetary cores.

Authors argue that this object may be a transiting disintegrating\nplanet with a comet like dusty tail. We calculate the light-curves of stars\nwith such planets and take into account the Mie absorption and scattering on\nspherical dust grains of various sizes assuming realistic dust opacities and\nphase functions and finite radius of the source of the scattered light. The\nplanet light-curve is reanalysed using long and short cadence Kepler\nobservations from the first 14 quarters. Orbital period of the planet was\nimproved. We prove that the peculiar light-curve of this objects is in\nagreement with the idea of a planet with a comet like tail. There is an\nevidence of a quasi periodic long term evolution of the tail. Light-curve has a\nprominent pre-transit brightening and a less prominent post-transit\nbrightening. Both are caused by the forward scattering and are a strong\nfunction of the particle size. This feature enabled us to estimate a typical\nparticle size (radius) in the dust tail of about 0.1-1 micron. However, there\nis an indication that the particle size changes along the tail. Larger\nparticles better reproduce the pre-transit brightening and transit core while\nsmaller particles are more compatible with the egress and post-transit\nbrightening. Dust density in the tail is a steep decreasing function of the\ndistance from the planet which indicates a significant tail destruction caused\nby the star. We also argue that the 'planet' does not show uniform behaviour\nbut may have at least two constituents. This light-curve with pre-transit\nbrightening is analogous to the light-curve of $\\epsilon$ Aur with mid-eclipse\nbrightening and forward scattering plays a significant role in such eclipsing\nsystems. \n\n"}

In non-isothermal discs, recent work has\nshown that a decreasing radial profile of the disc entropy can lead to a strong\npositive corotation torque which can significantly slow down or reverse Type I\nmigration in laminar viscous disc models. It is not clear however how this\npicture changes in turbulent disc models. The aim of this study is to examine\nthe impact of turbulence on the torque experienced by a low-mass planet\nembedded in a non-isothermal protoplanetary disc. We particularly focus on the\nrole of turbulence on the corotation torque whose amplitude depends on the\nefficiency of diffusion processes in the planet's horseshoe region. We\nperformed 2D numerical simulations using a grid-based hydrodynamical code in\nwhich turbulence is modelled as stochastic forcing. In order to provide\nestimations for the viscous and thermal diffusion coefficients as a function of\nthe amplitude of turbulence, we first set up non-isothermal disc models for\ndifferent values of the amplitude of the turbulent forcing. We then include a\nlow-mass planet and determine the evolution of its running time-averaged\ntorque. We show that in non-isothermal discs, the entropy-related corotation\ntorque can indeed remain unsaturated in the presence of turbulence. For\nturbulence amplitudes that do not strongly affect the disc temperature profile,\nwe find that the running time-averaged torque experienced by an embedded\nprotoplanet is in fairly good agreement with laminar disc models with\nappropriate values for the thermal and viscous diffusion coefficients. In discs\nwith turbulence driven by stochastic forcing, the corotation torque therefore\nbehaves similarly as in laminar viscous discs and can be responsible for\nsignificantly slowing down or reversing Type I migration. \n\n"}

The planets invoked in that work were\nsignificantly more massive than Jupiter, and moved on orbits that were mutually\ncrossing - an architecture which suggests that mutual encounters and strong\ngravitational interactions are almost guaranteed. In this work, we perform a\nhighly detailed analysis of the proposed HW Vir planetary system. First, we\nconsider the dynamical stability of the system as proposed in the discovery\nwork. Through a mapping process involving 91,125 individual simulations, we\nfind that the system is so unstable that the planets proposed simply cannot\nexist, due to mean lifetimes of less than a thousand years across the whole\nparameter space. We then present a detailed re-analysis of the observational\ndata on HW Vir, deriving a new orbital solution that provides a very good fit\nto the observational data. Our new analysis yields a system with planets more\nwidely spaced, and of lower mass, than that proposed in the discovery work, and\nyields a significantly greater (and more realistic) estimate of the uncertainty\nin the orbit of the outermost body. Despite this, a detailed dynamical analysis\nof this new solution similarly reveals that it also requires the planets to\nmove on orbits that are simply not dynamically feasible. Our results imply that\nsome mechanism other than the influence of planetary companions must be the\nprincipal cause of the observed eclipse timing variations for HW Vir.

Our results illustrate the critical importance of\nperforming dynamical analyses as a part of the discovery process for\nmultiple-planet exoplanetary systems. \n\n"}

The\ntemperature structure and distribution of the main atmospheric constituents are\ncalculated in the limit of an atmosphere that rotates as a solid body with an\nequatorial rotation rate of 1 km/s. Such motion mimics a uniform zonal wind\nwhich resembles the equatorial superrotation structure found by three\ndimensional circulation models. The uneven heating of this tidally locked\nplanet causes, even in the presence of such a strong zonal wind, large\ntemperature contrasts between the dayside and nightside, of up to 800 K. This\nwould result in important longitudinal variations of some molecular abundances\nif the atmosphere were at chemical equilibrium.

Thus, a sample of stars with transiting planets may not\naccurately represent the target population. Moreover, targets are selected\nusing criteria such as a limiting apparent magnitude. These selection effects,\ncombined with uncertainties in stellar radius, lead to biases in the properties\nof transiting planets and their host stars. We quantify possible biases in the\nKepler survey. First, Eddington bias produced by a steep planet radius\ndistribution and uncertainties in stellar radius results in a 15-20%\noverestimate of planet occurrence. Second, the magnitude limit of the Kepler\ntarget catalog induces Malmquist bias towards large, more luminous stars and\nunderestimation of the radii of about one third of candidate planets,\nespecially those larger than Neptune.

We find that\nalthough CO is predicted to be a major atmospheric constituent on hot Jupiters\nfor all C/O ratios, other oxygen-bearing molecules like H2O and CO2 are much\nmore abundant when C/O < 1, whereas CH4, HCN, and C2H2 gain significantly in\nabundance when C/O > 1. Disequilibrium processes tend to enhance the abundance\nof CH4, NH3, HCN, and C2H2 over a wide range of C/O ratios. We compare the\nresults of our models with secondary-eclipse photometric data from the Spitzer\nSpace Telescope and conclude that (1) disequilibrium models with C/O ~ 1 are\nconsistent with spectra of WASP-12b, XO-1b, and CoRoT-2b, confirming the\npossible carbon-rich nature of these planets, (2) spectra from HD 189733b are\nconsistent with C/O ~< 1, but as the assumed metallicity is increased above\nsolar, the required C/O ratio must increase toward 1 to prevent too much H2O\nabsorption, (3) species like HCN can have a significant influence on spectral\nbehavior in the 3.6 and 8.0 um Spitzer channels, potentially providing even\nmore opacity than CH4 when C/O > 1, and (4) the very high CO2 abundance\ninferred for HD 189733b from near-infrared observations cannot be explained\nthrough equilibrium or disequilibrium chemistry in a H2-dominated atmosphere.\nWe discuss possible formation mechanisms for carbon-rich hot Jupiters.

We have conducted a large survey of the young, nearby cluster\nIC 348, to uncover its low-mass brown dwarf population and study the cluster\nproperties in the substellar regime. Methods.

A spectroscopic follow-up of a\nlarge fraction of the candidates was conducted to assess their youth and\nmembership. Results. We confirmed spectroscopically 16 new members of the IC\n348 cluster, including 13 brown dwarfs, contributing significantly to the\nsubstellar census of the cluster, where only 30 brown dwarfs were previously\nknown.

We study the effect of limb darkening on the\nplanetary radius determination both via analytical expressions and by numerical\nexperiments. We also compare some of the existing limb darkening tables.

The [Si I]/[Fe II] images\ndisplay a more uniform morphology, which may be due to a remaining significant\ncontribution from radioactivity in the inner ejecta and the higher abundance of\nthese elements in the core.

It is directly related to the more familiar\n\"Roche limit,\" the distance from a planet at which a strengthless orbiting\nobject of given density is pulled apart by tides. The presence of a substantial\nring requires that transient clumps have an internal density less than\nrho_Roche. Conversely, in the presence of abundant material for accretion, an\norbiting object with density greater than rho_Roche will grow.\n  Comparing the rho_Roche values at which the Saturn and Uranus systems\ntransition rapidly from disruption-dominated (rings) to accretion-dominated\n(moons), we infer that the material composing Uranus' rings is likely more\nrocky, as well as less porous, than that composing Saturn's rings.\n  From the high values of rho_Roche at the innermost ring-moons of Jupiter and\nNeptune, we infer that those moons may be composed of denser material than\nexpected, or more likely that they are interlopers that formed farther from\ntheir planets and have since migrated inward, now being held together by\ninternal material strength.\n  Finally, the \"Portia group\" of eight closely-packed Uranian moons has an\noverall surface density similar to that of Saturn's A ring.

We explore gravitational interactions with\na distant planetary companion as a possible cause of these non-zero\neccentricities. For simplicity, we focus on the evolution of a planar\ntwo-planet system subject to slow eccentricity damping and provide an intuitive\ninterpretation of the resulting long-term orbital evolution. We show that\ndissipation shifts the two normal eigenmode frequencies and eccentricity ratios\nof the standard secular theory slightly, and that each mode decays at its own\nrate. Tidal damping of the eccentricities drives orbits to transition between\nperiods of pericenter circulation and libration, and the planetary system\nsettles into a locked state where the pericenters are nearly aligned or\nanti-aligned. Once in the locked state, the eccentricities of the two orbits\ndecrease very slowly due to tides rather than at the much more rapid\nsingle-planet rate, and thus eccentric orbits, even for close-in planets, can\noften survive much longer than the age of the system. Assuming that an observed\nclose-in planet on an elliptical orbit is apsidally-locked to a more distant,\nand perhaps unseen companion, we provide a constraint on the mass, semi-major\naxis, and eccentricity of the companion. We find the observed two-planet system\nHAT-P-13 might be in just such an apsidally-locked state, with parameters that\nobey our constraint well. We also survey close-in single planets, and found\nthat none provide compelling evidence for unseen companions. Instead, we\nsuspect that (1) orbits are circular, (2) tidal damping rates are slower than\nour assumption, or (3) a recent event has excited these eccentricities. Our\nmethod should prove useful for interpreting the results of current and future\nplanet searches. \n\n"}

The viability of the disk fragmentation scenario for the formation of\nwide-orbit companions in protostellar disks around (sub-)solar mass stars was\ninvestigated. Methods: We used numerical hydrodynamics simulations of disk\nformation and evolution with an accurate treatment of disk thermodynamics. The\nuse of the thin-disk limit allowed us to probe the long-term evolution of\nprotostellar disks. We focused on models that produced wide-orbit GP/BD\nembryos, which opened a gap in the disk and showed radial migration timescales\nsimilar to or longer than the typical disk lifetime. Results: While disk\nfragmentation was seen in the majority of our models, only 6 models out of 60\nrevealed the formation of quasi-stable, wide-orbit GP/BD embryos. Disk\nfragmentation produced GP/BD embryos with masses in the 3.5-43 M_J range,\ncovering the whole mass spectrum of directly-imaged, wide-orbit companions to\n(sub-)solar mass stars. On the other hand, our modelling failed to produce\nembryos on orbital distances <= 170 AU, whereas several directly-imaged\ncompanions were found at smaller orbits down to a few AU.

Therefore, GI followed by tidal downsizing can theoretically produce\nobjects spanning a large mass range, from terrestrial planets to giant planets\nand brown dwarfs.

{"id": "1306.5746", "contents": "Title: Luminosity of young Jupiters revisited. Massive cores make hot planets Abstract: The intrinsic luminosity of young Jupiters is of high interest for planet\nformation theory. It is an observable quantity that is determined by important\nphysical mechanisms during formation, namely the accretion shock structure, and\neven more fundamentally, the basic formation mechanism (core accretion or\ngravitational instability). We study the impact of the core mass on the\npost-formation entropy and luminosity of young giant planets forming via core\naccretion with a supercritical shock (cold accretion). For this, we conduct\nself-consistently coupled formation and evolution calculations of giant planets\nwith masses between 1 and 12 Jovian masses and core masses between 20 and 120\nEarth masses. We find that the post-formation luminosity of massive giant\nplanets is very sensitive to the core mass. An increase of the core mass by a\nfactor 6 results in an increase of the post-formation luminosity of a 10 Jovian\nmass planet by a factor 120. Due to this dependency, there is no single well\ndefined post-formation luminosity for core accretion, but a wide range. For\nmassive cores (~100 Earth masses), the post-formation luminosities of core\naccretion planets become so high that they approach those in the hot start\nscenario that is often associated with gravitational instability. For the\nmechanism to work, it is necessary that the solids are accreted before or\nduring gas runaway accretion, and that they sink deep into the planet. We make\nno claims whether or not such massive cores can actually form in giant planets.\nBut if yes, it becomes difficult to rule out core accretion as formation\nmechanism based solely on luminosity for directly imaged planets that are more\nluminous than predicted for low core masses. Instead of invoking gravitational\ninstability as the consequently necessary formation mode, the high luminosity\ncould also be caused simply by a more massive core. \n\n"}

Predictions of 146Sm and 144Sm\nproduction in the gamma-process in massive stars are at odds with these\nconstraints and this is partly due to deficiences in the prediction of the\nreaction rates involved.

A measurement of\n144Sm(alpha,gamma)148Gd at low energy had discovered considerable discrepancies\nbetween cross section predictions and the data.

These outflows are often modelled to be isotropic, but this\nassumption is not realistic for fast rotators, bipolar jets and supernovae.\nHere we derive the general equations of motion for the time evolution of a\nsingle planet, brown dwarf, comet or asteroid perturbed by anisotropic mass\nloss in terms of a complete set of planetary orbital elements, the ejecta\nvelocity, and the parent star's co-latitude and longitude.

However, if the\nprimordial binary fraction is higher, the fraction of G-dwarf systems that\ncould host a planetary system like our own is lowered to 38 per cent.\n  We extend our analysis to consider the fraction of G-dwarf systems (both\nsingle and binary) that can host either circumprimary planets (orbiting the\nprimary star of the binary) or circumbinary planets (orbiting both stars in the\nbinary) for fiducial planetary separations between 1 - 100au.

This would allow separate\ndeterminations for giant and medium planets of the relationship between the\ninward rate of tidal migration of planets and the strength of the stellar tidal\ndissipation (as expressed by the tidal quality factor Q). We propose a \"Hot Big\nPlanets Survey\" to find new big planets to better determine the planet\noccurrence distribution at the shortest period. We call planets that Kepler\nwill be able to find as \"big\", for the purpose of comparing the distribution of\ngiant and medium planets (above and below 8 earth radii). The distribution of\nplanets from one field has been interpreted to show that the shortest period\ngiant planets are at the end of an ongoing flow of high eccentricity migration,\nlikely from scattering from further out. The numbers of planets at these short\nperiods is still small, leaving uncertainty over the result that the\ndistribution shows the expected power index for inward tidal migration.

Gravitational perturbations from the companion are expected\nto excite high planetesimal eccentricities resulting in destruction, rather\nthan growth, of objects with sizes of up to several hundred km in collisions of\nsimilar-size bodies. It was recently suggested that gravity of a massive\naxisymmetric gaseous disk in which planetesimals are embedded drives rapid\nprecession of their orbits, suppressing eccentricity excitation. However, disks\nin binaries are themselves expected to be eccentric, leading to additional\nplanetesimal excitation. Here we develop secular theory of eccentricity\nevolution for planetesimals perturbed by the gravity of an elliptical\nprotoplanetary disk (neglecting gas drag) and the companion. For the first time\nwe derive an expression for the disturbing function due to an eccentric disk,\nwhich can be used for a variety of other astrophysical problems. We obtain\nexplicit analytical solutions for planetesimal eccentricity evolution and\ndelineate four different regimes of dynamical excitation. We show that in\nsystems with massive (>10^{-2}M_Sun) disks, planetesimal eccentricity is\nusually determined by the gravity of the eccentric disk alone, and is\ncomparable to the disk eccentricity. As a result, the latter imposes a lower\nlimit on collisional velocities of solids, making their growth problematic.\nThis fragmentation barrier can be removed if the gaseous disk rapidly precesses\nor if its own self-gravity is efficient at lowering disk eccentricity. \n\n"}

Models currently predict as\nmuch as 150 times the solar abundance of 33S in oxygen-neon nova ejecta.

Better knowledge of the\n33S(p,\\gamma)34Cl rate would also aid in interpreting nova observations over\nthe S-Ca mass region and contribute to the firm establishment of the maximum\nendpoint of nova nucleosynthesis. Additionally, the total S elemental abundance\nwhich is affected by this reaction has been proposed as a thermometer to study\nthe peak temperatures of novae. Previously, the 33S(p,\\gamma)34Cl reaction rate\nhad only been studied directly down to resonance energies of 432 keV. However,\nfor nova peak temperatures of 0.2-0.4 GK there are 7 known states in 34Cl both\nbelow the 432 keV resonance and within the Gamow window that could play a\ndominant role.

Within the context of this picture, significant\norbital obliquities characteristic of a substantial fraction of such planets\ncan be attributed to external torques that perturb the disks out of alignment\nwith the spin axes of their host stars. Therefore, the acquisition of orbital\nobliquity exhibits sensitive dependence on the physics of disk-star\ninteractions. Here, we analyze the primordial excitation of spin-orbit\nmisalignment of Sun-like stars, in light of disk-star angular momentum\ntransfer. We begin by calculating the stellar pre-main sequence rotational\nevolution, accounting for spin-up due to gravitational contraction and\naccretion as well as spin-down due to magnetic star-disk coupling. We devote\nparticular attention to angular momentum transfer by accretion, and show that\nwhile generally subdominant to gravitational contraction, this process is\nlargely controlled by the morphology of the stellar magnetic field (i.e.\nspecific angular momentum accreted by stars with octupole-dominated surface\nfields is smaller than that accreted by dipole-dominated stars by an order of\nmagnitude). Subsequently, we examine the secular spin-axis dynamics of\ndisk-bearing stars, accounting for the time-evolution of stellar and disk\nproperties and demonstrate that misalignments are preferentially excited in\nsystems where stellar rotation is not overwhelmingly rapid. Moreover, we show\nthat the excitation of spin-orbit misalignment occurs impulsively, through an\nencounter with a resonance between the stellar precession frequency and the\ndisk-torquing frequency.

We find that these effects can easily\nreproduce large AP deviations and so we caution that extracting the\neccentricity distribution is only viable with careful consideration of the\nprior distributions for these other effects.

The data are well fit by this\nexomoon model, but an alternate star+planet model fits the data almost as well.\nNevertheless, these results indicate the potential of microlensing to detect\nexomoons, albeit ones that are different from the giant planet moons in our\nsolar system. The argument for an exomoon hinges on the system being relatively\nclose to the Sun. The data constrain the product M pi_rel, where M is the lens\nsystem mass and pi_rel is the lens-source relative parallax. If the lens system\nis nearby (large pi_rel), then M is small (a few Jupiter masses) and the\ncompanion is a sub-Earth-mass exomoon.

Systems with 3-6 low-mass planets (or planet\ncandidates) produce a diversity of minimum-mass disks with surface density\nprofiles ranging from Sigma r^-3.2 to Sigma r^0.5 (5th-95th percentile). By\nsimulating the transit detection of populations of synthetic planetary systems\ndesigned to match the properties of observed super-Earth systems, we show that\na universal disk profile is statistically excluded at high confidence.

Assuming\nthat these emissions are caused by magnetic cycles similar to the sunspot\ncycle, we construct flux transport dynamo models of $1M_{\\odot}$ stars rotating\nwith different rotation periods. We first compute the differential rotation and\nthe meridional circulation inside these stars from a mean-field hydrodynamics\nmodel. Then these are substituted in our dynamo code to produce periodic\nsolutions. We find that the dimensionless amplitude $f_m$ of the toroidal flux\nthrough the star increases with decreasing rotation period.

The gravitational torque\non the disc from an inclined binary makes the disc precess around the binary\naxis, while the star-disc interaction torque due to the rotation-induced\nquadrupole makes the stellar spin and the disc angular momentum axes precess\naround each other. A significant star-disc misalignment angle can be generated\nfrom a small initial value as the star-disc system evolves in time such that\nthe two precession frequencies cross each other. This ``secular resonance''\nbehavior can be understood in a geometric way from the precession dynamics of\nspin and disc angular momenta. We derive the conditions for such resonance to\noccur, and find that they can be satisfied for reasonable protostar-disc-binary\nparameters. The evolution of star-disc inclination is also affected by mass\naccretion and by magnetic star-disc interaction torques, which can either\npromote or reduce star-disc misalignment. In general, as long as the initial\nbinary-disc inclination is greater than a few degrees, a variety of star-disc\nmisalignment angles can be generated within the disc lifetimes. We discuss the\nimplications of our results for the stellar spin orientations in binaries, for\nthe alignments/misalignments of protostellar discs and debris discs, and for\nthe stellar obliquities in exoplanetary systems.

Here, we show that for\nthe most commonly used covariance functions, the matrix $C$ can be\nhierarchically factored into a product of block low-rank updates of the\nidentity matrix, yielding an $\\mathcal O (n\\log^2 n) $ algorithm for inversion.\nMore importantly, we show that this factorization enables the evaluation of the\ndeterminant $\\det(C)$, permitting the direct calculation of probabilities in\nhigh dimensions under fairly broad assumptions on the kernel defining $K$. Our\nfast algorithm brings many problems in marginalization and the adaptation of\nhyperparameters within practical reach using a single CPU core. The combination\nof nearly optimal scaling in terms of problem size with high-performance\ncomputing resources will permit the modeling of previously intractable\nproblems.

Abstract: Giant planets like Jupiter and Saturn feature strong zonal wind patterns on\ntheir surfaces. Although several different mechanisms that may drive these jets\nhave been proposed over the last decades, the origin of the zonal winds is\nstill unclear. Here, we explore the possibility that the interplay of planetary\nrotation with the compression and expansion of the convecting fluid can drive\nmultiple deep zonal jets by a compressional Rhines-type mechanism, as\noriginally proposed by Ingersoll and Pollard (1982). In a certain limit, this\ndeep mechanism is shown to be mathematically analogous to the classical Rhines\nmechanism possibly operating at cloud level. Jets are predicted to occur on a\ncompressional Rhines length $l_R = (2 \\Omega \\langle H_\\rho^{-1} \\rangle\nv_{jet}^{-1} )^{-1/2}$, where $\\Omega$ is the angular velocity, $\\langle\nH_\\rho^{-1} \\rangle$ is the mean inverse density scale height and $v_{jet}$ is\nthe typical jet velocity. Two-dimensional numerical simulations using the\nanelastic approximation reveal that this mechanism robustly generates jets of\nthe predicted width, and that it typically dominates the dynamics in systems\ndeeper than $O(l_R)$. Potential vorticity staircases are observed to form\nspontaneously and are typically accompanied by unstably stratified buoyancy\nstaircases. The mechanism only operates at large rotation rates, exceeding\nthose typically reached in three-dimensional simulations of deep convection in\nspherical shells. Applied to Jupiter and Saturn, the compressional Rhines\nscaling reasonably fits the available observations. Interestingly, even weak\nvertical density variations such as those in the Earth core can give rise to a\nlarge number of jets, leading to fundamentally different flow structures than\npredicted by the Boussinesq models typically used in this context. \n\n"}

However, no\nco-orbital systems have been found within the thousands of Kepler planets and\ncandidates. Here we study the orbital evolution of co-orbital planets embedded\nin a protoplanetary disk using a grid-based hydrodynamics code. We show that\npairs of similar-mass planets in co-orbital resonance are disrupted during\nlarge-scale orbital migration. Destabilization occurs when one or both planets\nis near the critical mass needed to open a gap in the gaseous disk. A confined\ngap is opened that spans the 60 degree azimuthal separation between planets.\nThis alters the torques imparted by the disk on each planet -- pushing the\nleading planet outward and the trailing planet inward -- and disrupts the\nresonance. The mechanism applies to systems in which the two planets' masses\ndiffer by a factor of two or less. In a simple flared disk model the critical\nmass for gap opening varies from a few Earth masses at the inner edge of the\ndisk to 1 Saturn-mass at 5 AU. A pair of co-orbital planets with masses in this\nrange that migrates will enter a region where the planets are at the\ngap-opening limit. At that point the resonance is disrupted.

Our study is based on classical\nsecular theory, using a vectorial approach developed in a separate paper. When\nplanet-planet perturbations are truncated at the second order in eccentricity\nand mutual inclination, and the planet-companion perturbations are developed at\nthe quadrupole order, the problem becomes integrable. The motion is composed of\na uniform precession of the whole system around the total angular momentum, and\nin the rotating frame, the evolution is periodic.

The solution is obtained using a powerful\ngeometric method. With this technique, we identify four different regimes\ncharacterized by the nutation amplitude of the stellar spin-axis relative to\nthe orbital plane of the planets. In particular, the obliquity of the star\nreaches its maximum when the system is in the Cassini regime where planets have\nmore angular momentum than the star, and where the precession rate of the star\nis similar to that of the planets induced by the companion.

The differential analysis shows that this star is\nchemically very similar to the Sun. The refractory elements seem even slightly\nmore depleted than in the Sun, meaning that HIP 114328 may be as likely to form\nterrestrial planets as the Sun. HIP 114328 is about 2 Gyr older than the Sun,\nand is thus the second oldest solar twin analyzed at high precision.

We found that the dynamical\neffects of planetary encounters on Iapetus's orbit sensitively depend on the\ndistance of the few closest encounters. In four out of ten instability cases\nstudied here, the orbital perturbations were too large to be plausible. In one\ncase, Iapetus's orbit was practically unneffected. In the remaining five cases,\nthe perturbations of Iapetus's inclination were adequate to explain its present\nvalue.

To understand this\ncomplexity, the magnetic skeleton of the coronal field can be calculated. The\nskeleton highlights the separatrix surfaces that divide the field into\ntopologically distinct regions, allowing open-field regions on the solar\nsurface to be located. Furthermore, separatrix surfaces and their intersections\n(separators) are important likely energy release sites. This paper\ninvestigates, throughout the solar cycle, the nature of coronal magnetic-field\ntopologies that arise under the potential-field source-surface approximation.\nIn particular, we characterise the typical global fields at solar maximum and\nminimum. Global magnetic fields are extrapolated from observed Kitt Peak and\nSOLIS synoptic magnetograms, from Carrington rotations 1645 to 2144, using the\npotential-field source-surface model. Hence, variations in the coronal skeleton\nare studied over three solar cycles. Key building blocks which make up magnetic\nfields are identified and classified according to the nature of their\nseparatrix surfaces. The magnetic skeleton reveals that, at solar maximum, the\nglobal coronal field involves a multitude of topological structures at all\nlatitudes. Many open-field regions exist originating anywhere on the\nphotosphere. At solar minimum, the coronal topology is heavily influenced by\nthe solar dipole. A strong dipole results in a simple large-scale structure\ninvolving just two large polar open-field regions, but, at short radial\ndistances between plus or minus 60 deg latitude, the small-scale topology is\ncomplex. If the solar dipole if weak, as in the recent minimum, then the\nlow-latitude quiet-sun magnetic fields may be globally significant enough to\ncreate many disconnected open-field regions at low latitudes, in addition to\nthe two polar open-field regions. \n\n"}

We re-observed CoRoT-7 in January 2012 with both HARPS and CoRoT, so\nthat we now have the benefit of simultaneous radial-velocity and photometric\ndata.

To account for\nactivity-related effects in the radial-velocities which do not have a\nphotometric signature, we also include an additional activity term in the\nradial-velocity model, which we treat as a Gaussian process with the same\ncovariance properties (and hence the same frequency structure) as the light\ncurve.

Our new approach is\nbased on the TreeCol algorithm, which projects matter distributions onto a\nspherical grid to create maps of column densities for each fluid element in the\ncomputational domain. We have improved this algorithm by using the relative gas\nvelocities, to weight the individual matter contributions with the relative\nspectral line overlaps, in order to properly account for the Doppler effect. We\ncompare our new method to the widely used Sobolev approximation, which yields\nan estimate for the column density based on the local velocity gradient and the\nthermal velocity. This approach generally underestimates the photon escape\nprobability, because it neglects the density gradient and the actual shape of\nthe cloud. We present a correction factor for the true line overlap in the\nSobolev approximation and a new method based on local quantities, which fits\nthe exact results reasonably well during the collapse of the cloud, with the\nerror in the cooling rates always being less than 10%. Analytical fitting\nformulae fail at determining the photon escape probability after formation of\nthe first protostar (error of 40%) because they are based on the assumption of\nspherical symmetry and therefore break down once a protostellar accretion disc\nhas formed.

The bright and\nwell studied HAT-P-7 system is intriguing as several Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM)\nmeasurements found a large projected obliquity in this system, but it was so\nfar not possible to determine if the orbit is polar and/or retrograde. The goal\nof this study is to measure the stellar inclination and hereby the full 3D\nobliquity of the HAT-P-7 system instead of only the 2D projection as measured\nby the RM effect. In addition we provide an updated set of stellar parameters\nfor the star. We use the full set of available observations from Kepler\nspanning Q0-Q17 to produce the power spectrum of HAT-P-7. We extract\noscillation mode frequencies via an MCMC peak-bagging routine, and use the\nresults from this to estimate the stellar inclination angle. Combining this\nwith the projected obliquity from RM and the inclination of the orbital plane\nallows us to determine the stellar obliquity. We use asteroseismology to model\nthe star from the extracted frequencies using two different approaches to the\nmodelling where either the MESA or the GARSTEC stellar evolution codes are\nadopted. Using our updated asteroseismic modelling we find, i.a., the following\nstellar parameters for HAT-P-7: M=1.51{+0.04}{-0.05}Msun,\n$R=2.00{+0.01}{-0.02}Rsun, and age = 2.07{+0.28}{-0.23} Gyr. Our asteroseismic\nmodelling offers a high precision on the stellar parameters, for instance is\nthe uncertainty on age of the order ~11%.

The present work is concerned with the gravitational collapse\nof such clumps, idealized as being spherically symmetric. Calculations using\nthe two-fluid model are performed (almost) up to the time when a central\ndensity singularity forms. The end result of the study is a parametrization for\nthis time, in order that it may be compared with timescales for various\ndisruptive effects to which clumps may be subject. An important effect is that\nas the clump compresses, it also compresses the gas due to drag. This increases\ngas pressure which retards particle collapse and leads to oscillation in the\nsize and density of the clump. The ratio of gravitational force to gas pressure\ngives a two-phase Jeans parameter, $J_t$, which is the classical Jeans\nparameter with the sound speed replaced by an the wave speed in a coupled\ntwo-fluid medium. Its use makes the results insensitive to the initial density\nratio of particles to gas as a separate parameter. An ordinary differential\nequation model is developed which takes the form of two coupled non-linear\noscillators and reproduces key features of the simulations. Finally, a\nparametric study of the time to collapse is performed and a formula (fit to the\nsimulations) is developed. In the incompressible limit $J_t \\to 0$, collapse\ntime equals sedimentation time. As $J_t$ increases, the collapse time decreases\nroughly linearly with $J_t$ until $J_t \\gtrsim 0.4$ when it becomes\napproximately equal to the dynamical time. \n\n"}

NuSTAR was primarily designed for\nspectroscopic observations of sources with relatively low count-rates rather\nthan for timing analysis of bright objects. The instrumental dead time per\nevent is relatively long (~2.5 msec), and varies by a few percent\nevent-to-event. The most obvious effect is a distortion of the white noise\nlevel in the power density spectrum (PDS) that cannot be modeled easily with\nthe standard techniques due to the variable nature of the dead time. In this\npaper, we show that it is possible to exploit the presence of two completely\nindependent focal planes and use the cross power density spectrum to obtain a\ngood proxy of the white noise-subtracted PDS. Thereafter, one can use a Monte\nCarlo approach to estimate the remaining effects of dead time, namely a\nfrequency-dependent modulation of the variance and a frequency-independent drop\nof the sensitivity to variability. In this way, most of the standard timing\nanalysis can be performed, albeit with a sacrifice in signal to noise relative\nto what would be achieved using more standard techniques.

This last contribution is going to be characterised by the\nLISA Pathfinder mission, a technology precursor of future space-borne detectors\nlike eLISA. Changing the perspective from displacement to acceleration can\nbenefit the data analysis of LISA Pathfinder and future detectors. The response\nin differential acceleration to gravitational waves is derived for a\nspace-based detector's interferometric link. The acceleration formalism can\nalso be integrated into time delay interferometry by building up the\nunequal-arm Michelson differential acceleration combination.

The parameterization is performed from a\ncomparison of 3D CO5BOLD simulations with a grid of 1D envelopes with a varying\nmixing-length parameter. In many instances, the 3D simulations are restricted\nto the upper part of the convection zone. The hydrodynamical calculations\nsuggest, in those cases, that the entropy of the upflows does not change\nsignificantly from the bottom of the convection zone to regions immediately\nbelow the photosphere. We rely on this asymptotic entropy value, characteristic\nof the deep and adiabatically stratified layers, to calibrate 1D envelopes. The\ncalibration encompasses the convective hydrogen-line (DA) white dwarfs in the\neffective temperature range 6000 < Teff (K) < 15,000 and the surface gravity\nrange 7.0 < log g < 9.0. It is established that the local MLT is unable to\nreproduce simultaneously the thermodynamical, flux, and dynamical properties of\nthe 3D simulations. We therefore propose three different parameterizations for\nthese quantities. The resulting calibration can be applied to structure and\nenvelope calculations, in particular for pulsation, chemical diffusion, and\nconvective mixing studies. On the other hand, convection has no effect on the\nwhite dwarf cooling rates until there is a convective coupling with the\ndegenerate core below Teff ~ 5000 K. In this regime, the 1D structures are\ninsensitive to the MLT parameterization and converge to the mean 3D results,\nhence remain fully appropriate for age determinations. \n\n"}

We propose that these remarkable ALMA observations---which may bear\non how planetesimals form---reflect a gravitational global mode in the gas\ndisk. The mode is (1) fast---its pattern speed equals the disk's mean Keplerian\nfrequency; (2) of azimuthal wavenumber $m=1$, displacing the host star from the\nbarycenter; and (3) Toomre-stable. We solve for gas streamlines including the\nindirect stellar potential in the frame rotating with the pattern speed, under\nthe drastic simplification that gas does not feel its own gravity. Near\nco-rotation, the gas disk takes the form of a horseshoe-shaped annulus. Dust\nparticles with aerodynamic stopping times much shorter or much longer than the\norbital period are dragged by gas toward the horseshoe center. For intermediate\nstopping times, dust converges toward a $\\sim$45$^\\circ$-wide arc on the\nco-rotation circle. Particles that do not reach their final accumulation points\nwithin disk lifetimes, either because of gas turbulence or long particle drift\ntimes, conform to horseshoe-shaped gas streamlines.

The origin of these close-in\nsuper-Earths and mini-Neptunes is a major unanswered question in planet\nformation. Unlike Earth, whose atmosphere contains $<10^{-6}$ its total mass, a\nlarge fraction of close-in planets have significant gaseous envelopes,\ncontaining $1 -10\\%$ or more of their total mass. It has been proposed that\nthese close-in planets formed in situ either by delivery of $50-100M_{\\oplus}$\nof rocky material to the inner disc, or in a disc enhanced relative to the\nMMSN. In both cases, final assembly of the planets occurs by giant impacts\n(GIs). Here we test the viability of these scenarios. We show that atmospheres\naccreted by isolation masses are small ($10^{-3}-10^{-2}$ the core mass) and\nthat atmospheric mass-loss during GIs is significant, with typical post-GI\natmospheres that are $8 \\times 10^{-4}$ the core mass. Such values are\nconsistent with terrestrial planet atmospheres but more than an order of\nmagnitude below atmospheric masses of $1-10\\%$ inferred for many close-in\nexoplanets. In the most optimistic scenario with no core luminosity, post-GI\nenvelope accretion from a depleted gas disc yields atmospheric masses that are\nseveral per cent the core mass. If the gravitational potential energy due to\nthe last mass doubling of the planet by GIs is released over the disc\ndissipation time-scale as core luminosity, then envelope masses are reduced by\nabout an order of magnitude. Finally we show that radial drift time-scales due\nto gas drag for many isolation masses are shorter than typical disc lifetimes.\nGiven these challenges, we conclude that most observed close-in planets with\nenvelopes larger than several per cent likely formed at larger separations from\ntheir host stars. \n\n"}

We find\nthat even when the criterion is satisfied, there are instances when planets\nstill do not open gaps. We stress that gap-opening is not only dependent on\nwhether a planet has the ability to open a gap, but whether it can do so\nquickly enough. This can be expressed as an additional condition on the\ngap-opening timescale versus the crossing time, i.e. the time it takes the\nplanet to cross the region which it is carving out. While this point has been\nbriefly made in the previous literature, our results quantify it for a range of\nprotoplanetary disk properties and planetary masses, demonstrating how crucial\nit is for gap-opening. This additional condition has important implications for\nthe survival of planets formed by core accretion in low mass disks as well as\ngiant planets or brown dwarfs formed by gravitational instability in massive\ndisks. It is particularly important for planets with intermediate masses\nsusceptible to Type III-like migration. For some observed transition disks or\ndisks with gaps, we expect that estimates on the potential planet masses based\non the torque balance gap-opening criterion alone may not be sufficient. With\nconsideration of this additional timescale criterion theoretical studies may\nfind a reduced planet survivability or that planets may migrate further inwards\nbefore opening a gap. \n\n"}

Two migration channels for hot Jupiters have been\nproposed: through a protoplanetary gas disc or by tidal circularisation of\nhighly-eccentric planets.

The formation of the new WD\nplanetary system starts with a tidal break-up of the parent planet to\nplanetesimals near the tidal radius of about 1Rsun. Internal stress forces keep\nthe planetesimal from further tidal break-up when their radius is less than\nabout 100km. We speculate that the planetesimals then bind together to form new\nsub-Earth - daughter-planets at a few solar radii around the WD. More massive\nplanets that contain hydrogen supply the WD with fresh nuclear fuel to\nreincarnate its stellar-giant phase. Some of the hydrogen will be inflated in a\nlarge envelope. The envelope blows a wind to form a nebula that is later (after\nthe entire envelope is lost) ionized by the hot WD. We term this glowing\nionized nebula that originated from a planet a real planetary nebula (RPN).\nThis preliminary study of daughter-planets from a planet (DPP) and the RPN\nscenarios are of speculative nature.

Planet-metallicity correlations Abstract: Core Accretion (CA), the de-facto accepted theory of planet formation,\nrequires formation of massive solid cores as a prerequisite for assembly of gas\ngiant planets. The observed metallicity correlations of exoplanets are puzzling\nin the context of CA. While gas giant planets are found preferentially around\nmetal-rich host stars, planets smaller than Neptune orbit hosts with a wide\nrange of metallicities. We propose an alternative interpretation of these\nobservations in the framework of a recently developed planet formation\nhypothesis called Tidal Downsizing (TD). We perform population synthesis\ncalculations based on TD, and find that the connection between the populations\nof the gas giant and the smaller solid-core dominated planets is non linear and\nnot even monotonic. While gas giant planets formed in the simulations in the\ninner few AU region follow a strong positive correlation with the host star\nmetallicity, the smaller planets do not. The simulated population of these\nsmaller planets shows a shallow peak in their formation efficiency at around\nthe Solar metallicity. This result is driven by the fact that at low\nmetallicities the solid core's growth is damped by the scarcity of metals,\nwhereas at high metallicities the fragments within which the cores grow\ncontract too quickly, cutting the core's growth time window short. Finally,\nsimulated giant gas planets do not show a strong host star metallicity\npreference at large separations, which may explain why one of the best known\ndirectly imaged gas giant planet systems, HR 8799, is metal poor. \n\n"}

Two-dimensional global disk simulations Abstract: Recent observations of gaps and non-axisymmetric features in the dust\ndistributions of transition disks have been interpreted as evidence of embedded\nmassive protoplanets. However, comparing the predictions of planet-disk\ninteraction models to the observed features has shown far from perfect\nagreement. This may be due to the strong approximations used for the\npredictions. For example, spiral arm fitting typically uses results that are\nbased on low-mass planets in an isothermal gas. In this work, we describe\ntwo-dimensional, global, hydrodynamical simulations of disks with embedded\nprotoplanets, with and without the assumption of local isothermality, for a\nrange of planet-to-star mass ratios 1-10 M_jup for a 1 M_sun star.

We find that the inner and\nouter spiral wakes of massive protoplanets (M>5 M_jup) produce significant\nshock heating that can trigger buoyant instabilities. These drive sustained\nturbulence throughout the disk when they occur. The strength of this effect\ndepends strongly on the mass of the planet and the thermal relaxation\ntimescale; for a 10 M_jup planet embedded in a thin, purely adiabatic disk, the\nspirals, gaps, and vortices typically associated with planet-disk interactions\nare disrupted.

As expected the photometric\nsignal increases with impactor size, but we find also that the photometric\nsignature decreases rapidly as the target asteroid diameter increases, due to\ngravitational fallback.

Known observed\nproperties of S2 that contribute to lobe filling are 1) the enormous mass\nratio, $M_{SMBH}/M_{S2}$, 2) S2's fast rotation, and 3) S2's large orbital\neccentricity.

The lifetime\nof a magma ocean and its spectra through a steam atmosphere depends on the\norbital distance of the planet from the host star. For a type-I planet, which\nis formed beyond a certain critical distance from the host star, the thermal\nemission declines on a timescale shorter than approximately $10^6$ years.\nTherefore, young stars should be targets when searching for molten planets in\nthis orbital region. In contrast, a type-II planet, which is formed inside the\ncritical distance, will emit significant thermal radiation from near-infrared\natmospheric windows during the entire lifetime of the magma ocean. The Ks and L\nbands will be favorable for future direct imaging because the planet-to-star\ncontrasts of these bands are higher than approximately 10$^{-7}$-10$^{-8}$.

A novel analysis of reduced\nMHD equilibria shows that their magnetic fields have an asymmetric structure in\nthe axial direction with variation length-scale $z_\\ell \\sim \\ell B_0/b$, where\n$B_0$ is the intensity of the strong axial guide field, $b$ that of the\northogonal magnetic field component, and $\\ell$ the scale of $\\mathbf{b}$.\nEquilibria are then quasi-invariant along the axial direction for variation\nscales larger than approximatively the loop length $z_\\ell \\gtrsim L_z$, and\nincreasingly more asymmetric for smaller variation scales $z_\\ell \\lesssim\nL_z$.

Spin\n  dynamics and extension to Mercury and exoplanets host stars Abstract: This paper deals with the application of the creep tide theory (Ferraz-Mello,\nCeMDA 116, 109, 2013) to the rotation of close-in satellites, Mercury, close-in\nexoplanets and their host stars. The solutions show two extreme cases: close-in\ngiant gaseous planets, with fast relaxation (low viscosity) and satellites and\nEarth-like planets, with slow relaxation (high viscosity). The rotation of\nclose-in gaseous planets follows the classical Darwinian pattern: it is tidally\ndriven towards a stationary solution which is synchronized, but, if the orbit\nis elliptical, with a frequency larger than the orbital mean-motion. The\nrotation of rocky bodies, however, may be driven to several attractors whose\nfrequencies are 1/2,1,3/2,2,5/2 ... times the mean-motion. The number of\nattractors increases with the viscosity of the body and with the orbital\neccentricity. The classical example is Mercury, whose rotational period is 2/3\nof the orbital period (3/2 attractor). The planet behaves as a molten body with\na relaxation that allowed it to cross the 2/1 attractor without being trapped,\nbut not to escape being trapped in the 3/2 one. In that case, the relaxation is\nestimated to lie in the interval 4.6 -- 27 x 10^{-9} s^{-1} (equivalent to a\nquality factor roughly constrained to the interval 5<Q<50). The stars have\nrelaxation similar to the hot Jupiters and their rotation is also driven to the\nonly stationary solution existing in these cases. However, solar-type stars may\nlose angular momentum due to stellar wind, braking the rotation and displacing\nthe attractor towards larger periods. Old active host stars with big close-in\ncompanions generally have rotational periods larger than the orbital periods of\nthe companions.

This gas envelope, if more massive\nthan a few percent of the core (with a mass below $10 M_\\oplus$), has a cooling\ntime that is much longer than the time-scale on which the planet exits the\ndisk. As such, it could not have contracted significantly from its original\nsize, of order the Bondi radius. So a newly exposed proto-planet would be\nlosing mass via a Parker wind that is catalyzed by the stellar continuum\nradiation. This represents an intermediate stage of mass-loss, occurring soon\nafter the disc has dispersed, but before the EUV/X-ray driven photoevaporation\nbecomes relevant. The surface mass-loss induces a mass movement within the\nenvelope that advects internal heat outward. As a result, the planet atmosphere\nrapidly cools down and contracts, until it has reached a radius of order $0.1$\nBondi radius, at which time the mass-loss effectively shuts down. Within a\nmillion years after the disk disperses, we find a planet that has only about\nten percent of its original envelope, and a Kelvin-Helmholtz time that is much\nlonger than its actual age. We suggest that this \"boil-off\" process may be\npartially responsible for the lack of planets above a radius of $2.5 R_\\oplus$\nin the {\\it Kepler} data, provided planet formation results in initial envelope\nmasses of tens of percent. \n\n"}

We compare the recent resolved continuum observations of the disk\naround HD 100546 with the results of dust evolution simulations using an\nanalytical prescription for the shapes of gaps carved by massive planets.\n  Results. An inner pressure bump must have been present since early in the\ndisk lifetime to have good agreement between the dust evolution models and the\ncontinuum observations of HD 100546. This pressure bump may have resulted from\nthe presence of a very massive planet ($\\sim20 M_{\\rm{Jup}}$), which formed\nearly in the inner disk ($r\\sim$10 AU). If only this single planet exists, the\ndisk is likely to be old, comparable to the stellar age ($\\sim$5-10 Myr).\nAnother possible explanation is an additional massive planet in the outer disk\n($r\\sim70$ AU): either a low-mass outer planet ($\\lesssim5 M_{\\rm{Jup}}$)\ninjected at early times, or a higher mass outer planet ($\\gtrsim15\nM_{\\rm{Jup}}$) formed very recently, traps the right amount of dust in pressure\nbumps to reproduce the observations.

The\nfraction of planetary systems that remains intact as a cluster member, fbps, is\ngenerally well-described by the functional form fbps=f0(1+[a/a0]^c)^-1, where\n(1-f0) is the fraction of stars that escapes from the cluster, a0 the critical\nsemi-major axis for survival, and c a measure for the width of the transition\nregion.

We develop a thermal-orbital evolution model calibrated to\nEarth that couples tidal dissipation, with a temperature-dependent Maxwell\nrheology, to orbital circularization and migration. We illustrate\nthermal-orbital steady states where surface heat flow is balanced by tidal\ndissipation and cooling can be stalled for billions of years until\ncircularization occurs. Orbital energy dissipated as tidal heat in the interior\ndrives both inward migration and circularization, with a circularization time\nthat is inversely proportional to the dissipation rate. We identify a peak in\nthe internal dissipation rate as the mantle passes through a visco-elastic\nstate at mantle temperatures near 1800 K. Planets orbiting a 0.1 solar-mass\nstar within $0.07$ AU circularize before 10 Gyr, independent of initial\neccentricity. Once circular, these planets cool monotonically and maintain\ndynamos similar to Earth. Planets forced into eccentric orbits can experience a\nsuper-cooling of the core and rapid core solidification, inhibiting dynamo\naction for planets in the habitable zone. We find that tidal heating is\ninsignificant in the habitable zone around $0.45$ (or larger) solar mass stars\nbecause tidal dissipation is a stronger function of orbital distance than\nstellar mass, and the habitable zone is further from larger stars. Suppression\nof the planetary magnetic field exposes the atmosphere to stellar wind erosion\nand the surface to harmful radiation.

We show that, under these\nconditions, grains with sizes a >0.01 micron exhibit dramatic (exceeding factor\n~1000) fluctuations in the local dust-to-gas ratio (implying large small-scale\nvariations in abundances, dust cooling rates, and dynamics). The dust can form\nhighly filamentary structures (which would be observed in both dust emission\nand extinction), which can be much thinner than the characteristic width of gas\nfilaments. Sometimes, the dust and gas filaments are not even in the same\nlocation.

The overall higher planet occurrence\nrates around M stars are not consistent with the redistribution of the same\nmass into more, smaller planets.

Combining the best-fit magnitude distribution\nof faint objects from our survey with an analysis of the magnitude distribution\nof bright objects listed in the Minor Planet Center catalog, we obtain the\nabsolute magnitude distribution of Trojans over the entire range from $H=7.2$\nto $H=16.4$. We show that the $g-i$ color of Trojans decreases with increasing\nmagnitude. In the context of the less-red and red color populations, as\nclassified in Wong et al. 2014 using photometric and spectroscopic data, we\ndemonstrate that the observed trend in color for the faint Trojans is\nconsistent with the expected trend derived from extrapolation of the best-fit\ncolor population magnitude distributions for bright catalogued Trojans. This\nindicates a steady increase in the relative number of less-red objects with\ndecreasing size. Finally, we interpret our results using collisional modeling\nand propose several hypotheses for the color evolution of the Jupiter Trojan\npopulation. \n\n"}

Sintering is known to reduce\nthe sticking efficiency of dust aggregates and occurs at temperatures slightly\nbelow the sublimation point of their constituent material. We here present a\ndust growth model incorporating sintering and use it to simulate global dust\nevolution due to sintering, coagulation, fragmentation, and radial inward drift\nin a modeled HL Tau disk. We show that aggregates consisting of multiple\nspecies of volatile ices experience sintering, collisionally disrupt, and pile\nup at multiple locations slightly outside the snow lines of the volatiles. At\nwavelengths of 0.87--1.3 mm, these sintering zones appear as bright, optically\nthick rings with a spectral slope of $\\approx 2$, whereas the non-sintering\nzones as darker, optically thinner rings of a spectral slope of $\\approx$\n2.3--2.5.

We studied the role of the snow line in the survival of\nthe inner disk of transition disks. Inside the snow line, the lack of ice\nmantles in dust particles decreases the sticking efficiency between grains. As\na consequence, particles fragment at lower collision velocities than in regions\nbeyond the snow line. This effect allows small particles to be maintained for\nup to a few Myrs within the first astronomical unit. These particles are\nclosely coupled to the gas and do not drift significantly with respect to the\ngas. For lower mass planets (1$M_{\\rm{Jup}}$), the pre-transition appearance\ncan be maintained even longer because dust still trickles through the gap\ncreated by the planet, moves invisibly and quickly in the form of relatively\nlarge grains through the gap, and becomes visible again as it fragments and\ngets slowed down inside of the snow line.

Previous studies using simulated\nphotometry of Earth show that continuous observations over most of a planet's\norbit can be inverted to infer obliquity. However, few studies of more general\nplanets with arbitrary albedo markings have been made and, in particular, a\nsimple theoretical understanding of why it is possible to extract obliquity\nfrom light curves is missing. Reflected light seen by a distant observer is the\nproduct of a planet's albedo map, its host star's illumination, and the\nvisibility of different regions. It is useful to treat the product of\nillumination and visibility as the kernel of a convolution. Time-resolved\nphotometry constrains both the albedo map and the kernel, the latter of which\nsweeps over the planet due to rotational and orbital motion. The kernel's\nmovement distinguishes prograde from retrograde rotation for planets with\nnon-zero obliquity on inclined orbits. We demonstrate that the kernel's\nlongitudinal width and mean latitude are distinct functions of obliquity and\naxial orientation. Notably, we find that a planet's spin axis affects the\nkernel -- and hence time-resolved photometry -- even if this planet is\nEast-West uniform or spinning rapidly, or if it is North-South uniform. We find\nthat perfect knowledge of the kernel at 2-4 orbital phases is usually\nsufficient to uniquely determine a planet's spin axis. Surprisingly, we predict\nthat East-West albedo contrast is more useful for constraining obliquity than\nNorth-South contrast. \n\n"}

This paper focuses on this type of magnetic field configuration,\nwhere the resulting flow becomes manifestly time-dependent. We consider the\ncase of both steady heating and time-variable heating, and find the time scales\nfor the corresponding time variations of the outflow. Because the flow cannot\npass through the sonic transition, it remains subsonic and leads to so-called\nbreeze solutions.

This strategy has been shown to give better results, as\nfixing the coefficients to theoretical values can give rise to important\nsystematic errors which directly impact the physical properties of the system\nderived from such lightcurves such as the planetary radius. However, studies of\nthe effect of limb darkening assumptions on the retrieved parameters have\nmostly focused on the widely used quadratic limb-darkening law, leaving out\nother proposed laws that are either simpler or better descriptions of model\nintensity profiles. In this work, we show that laws such as the logarithmic,\nsquare-root and three-parameter law do a better job than the quadratic and\nlinear laws when deriving parameters from transit lightcurves, both in terms of\nbias and precision, for a wide range of situations.

To clarify the situation, we address\nthe optimum ranges of applicability (in terms of the $T_{eff}$ range covered by\nthe HB stars) for visual and near-UV CMDs, as far as application of this HB $Y$\ntest goes.

Cloud\nformation modeling predicts considerable inhomogeneities of cloud cover,\nconsistent with optical phase curve observations. However, optical phase curves\ncannot resolve some existing degeneracies between cloud location and cloud\noptical properties.\n  We present a conceptually simple technique to detect inhomogeneous cloud\ncover on exoplanets. Such an inhomogeneous cloud cover produces an asymmetric\nprimary transit of the planet in front of the host star. Asymmetric transits\nproduce characteristic residuals compared to a standard symmetric model.\nFurthermore, bisector spans can be used to determine asymmetries in the transit\nlight curve.\n  We apply a model of asymmetric transits to the light curves of HAT-P-7b,\nKepler-7b and HD209458b and search for possible cloud signatures. The nearly\nuninterrupted Kepler photometry is particularly well-suited for this method\nsince it allows for a very high time resolution.\n  We do not find any statistically sound cloud signature in the data of the\nconsidered planets.

Abstract: Astrometry covers a parameter space that cannot be reached by RV or transit\nmethods to detect terrestrial planets on wide orbits. In addition, high\naccuracy astrometric measurements are necessary to measure the inclination of\nthe planet's orbits. Here we investigate the principles of an artefact of the\nastrometric approach. Namely, the displacement of the photo-centre due to\ninhomogeneities in a dust disc around the parent star. Indeed, theory and\nobservations show that circumstellar discs can present strong asymmetries. We\nmodel the pseudo-astrometric signal caused by these inhomogeneities, asking\nwhether a dust clump in a disc can mimic the astrometric signal of an\nEarth-like planet. We show that these inhomogeneities cannot be neglected when\nusing astrometry to find terrestrial planets. We provide the parameter space\nfor which these inhomogeneities can affect the astrometric signals but still\nnot be detected by mid-IR observations. We find that a small cross section of\ndust corresponding to a cometary mass object is enough to mimic the astrometric\nsignal of an Earth-like planet. Astrometric observations of protoplanetary\ndiscs to search for planets can also be affected by the presence of\ninhomogeneities. Some further tests are given to confirm whether an observation\nis a real planet astrometric signal or an impostor. Eventually, we also study\nthe case where the cross section of dust is high enough to provide a detectable\nIR-excess and to have a measurable photometric displacement by actual\ninstruments such as Gaia, IRAC or GRAVITY. We suggest a new method, which\nconsists in using astrometry to quantify asymmetries (clumpiness) in inner\ndebris discs that cannot be otherwise resolved. \n\n"}

Debris disc presence does not\ncorrelate with the host star's metallicity, and may anti-correlate with the\npresence of gas giant planets. These observations contradict both assumptions\nand predictions of the highly successful Core Accretion model of planet\nformation. Here we explore predictions of the alternative Tidal Downsizing (TD)\nscenario of planet formation. In TD, small planets and planetesimal debris is\nmade only when gas fragments, predecessors of giant planets, are tidally\ndisrupted. We show that these disruptions are rare in discs around high\nmetallicity stars but release more debris per disruption than their low [M/H]\nanalogs. This predicts no simple relation between debris disc presence and host\nstar's [M/H], as observed. A detected gas giant planet implies in TD that its\npredecessor fragment was not disputed, potentially explaining why DDs are less\nlikely to be found around stars with gas giants. Less massive planets should\ncorrelate with DD presence, and sub-Saturn planets ($M_{p} \\sim 50\n\\M_{\\oplus}$) should correlate with DD presence stronger than sub-Neptunes\n($M_{p} \\leq 15 \\M_{\\oplus}$).

To quantify the limitation of various\nmodels and methods, we compare different noise models and signal detection\ncriteria for various simulated and real data sets in the Bayesian framework.\nAccording to our analyses, the white noise model tend to interpret noise as\nsignal, leading to false positives. On the other hand, the red noise models are\nlikely to interprete signal as noise, resulting in false negatives. We find\nthat the Bayesian information criterion combined with a Bayes factor threshold\nof 150 can efficiently rule out false positives and confirm true detections. We\nfurther propose a Goldilocks principle aimed at modeling radial velocity noise\nto avoid too many false positives and too many false negatives.

The mass-to-light ratio is M/L=48 M_sun/L_sun, and the dark\nmatter fraction is 98 percent within the half-light radius. The high mass of\nDragonfly 44 is accompanied by a large globular cluster population.

The formation of planetary systems is a common, yet complex\nmechanism. Numerous stars have been identified to possess a debris disk, a\nproto-planetary disk or a planetary system. The understanding of such formation\nprocess requires the study of debris disks. These targets are substantial and\nparticularly suitable for optical and infrared observations. Sparse Aperture\nmasking (SAM) is a high angular resolution technique strongly contributing to\nprobe the region from 30 to 200 mas around the stars. This area is usually\nunreachable with classical imaging, and the technique also remains highly\ncompetitive compared to vortex coronagraphy. Aims. We aim to study debris disks\nwith aperture masking to probe the close environment of the stars. Our goal is\neither to find low mass companions, or to set detection limits. Methods.

For the InfraRed Array Camera (IRAC) on the\nSpitzer Space Telescope, a popular way to handle this is\nBiLinearly-Interpolated Subpixel Sensitivity (BLISS) mapping. As part of a\nMarkov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), BLISS mapping estimates the sensitivity at\nmany locations (knots) on the pixel, then interpolates to the target star's\ncentroids. We show that such embedded optimization schemes can misfit or bias\nparameters. Thus, we construct a model of $\\textit{Spitzer}$ eclipse light\ncurves to test the accuracy and precision of BLISS mapping. We compare standard\nBLISS mapping to a variant where the knots are fit during the MCMC, as well as\nto a polynomial model. Both types of BLISS mapping give similar eclipse depths,\nand we find that standard knots behave like real parameters. Standard BLISS\nmapping is therefore a reasonable shortcut to fitting for knots in an MCMC.\nBLISS maps become inaccurate when the photon noise is low, but typically\napproximate the real sensitivity well. We also find there is no perfect method\nfor choosing the ideal number of BLISS knots to use on given data. BLISS\nmapping gives fits that are usually more accurate than precise (i.e. they are\noverly conservative), and the routine is more precise than polynomial models\nfor significant eclipses or pixels with more varied sensitivities. BLISS\nmapping has better predictive power for most of these particular synthetic\ndata, depending on how one treats time-correlated residuals.

This spiral wave instability (SWI)\narises from a resonant interaction between pairs of inertial waves, or\ninertial-gravity waves, and the background spiral wave. The development of the\ninstability in the linear regime involves the growth of a broad spectrum of\ninertial modes, with growth rates on the order of the orbital time, and results\nin a nonlinear saturated state in which turbulent velocity perturbations are of\na similar magnitude to those induced by the spiral wave.

Chemical\nkinetics models have been widely used in the literature to investigate the\nchemical compositions of hot Jupiter atmospheres which are expected to be\ndriven away from chemical equilibrium via processes such as vertical mixing and\nphotochemistry. All of these models have so far used pressure--temperature\n(P-T) profiles as fixed model input. This results in a decoupling of the\nchemistry from the radiative and thermal properties of the atmosphere, despite\nthe fact that in nature they are intricately linked. We use a one-dimensional\nradiative-convective equilibrium model, ATMO, which includes a sophisticated\nchemistry scheme to calculate P-T profiles which are fully consistent with\nnon-equilibrium chemical abundances, including vertical mixing and\nphotochemistry. Our primary conclusion is that, in cases of strong chemical\ndisequilibrium, consistent calculations can lead to differences in the P-T\nprofile of up to 100 K compared to the P-T profile derived assuming chemical\nequilibrium. This temperature change can, in turn, have important consequences\nfor the chemical abundances themselves as well as for the simulated emission\nspectra.

We used high angular\nresolution images of the SiO(2-1) and HCN(1-0) emission lines obtained with the\nIRAM plateau de Bure (PdBI) interferometer and combined with data from the IRAM\n30 m radiotelescope. These data were complemented by a Herschel column density\nmap of the region. We performed spectral analysis of SiO and HCN emission line\nprofiles to identify protostellar outflows and spatially disentangle two\nvelocity components associated with low- and high-velocity shocks. Then, we\ncompared the low-velocity shock component to a dedicated grid of\none-dimensional (1D) radiative shock models. We find that the SiO emission\noriginates from a mixture of high-velocity shocks caused by bipolar outflows\nand low-velocity shocks. Using SiO and HCN emission lines, we extract seven\nbipolar outflows associated with massive dense cores previously identified\nwithin the W43-MM1 mini-starburst cluster. Comparing observations with\ndedicated Paris-Durham shock models constrains the velocity of the low-velocity\nshock component from 7 to 12km/s. The SiO arising from low-velocity shocks\nspreads along the complete length of the ridge. Its contribution represents at\nleast 45% and up to 100% of the total SiO emission depending on the area\nconsidered. The low-velocity component of SiO is most likely associated with\nthe ridge formation through colliding flows or cloud-cloud collision. \n\n"}

Application of\nthis technique found a variation of radius with wavelength which was far too\nstrong to be explained by scattering processes in the planetary atmosphere. A\nfaint nearby star was subsequently detected, whose contamination of the transit\nlight curves might explain this anomaly. We present a reanalysis of published\ndata in order to characterise the faint star and assess its effect on the\nmeasured transmission spectrum. The faint star has a mass of 0.72 +/- 0.08 Msun\nand is almost certainly gravitationally bound to the planetary system. We find\nthat its effect on the measured physical properties of the planet and host star\nis small, amounting to a planetary radius larger by 0.6 sigma and planetary\ndensity smaller by 0.8 sigma. Its influence on the measured transmission\nspectrum is much greater: the spectrum now has a minimum around 760 nm and\nopacity rises to both bluer and redder wavelengths. It is a poor match to\ntheoretical spectra and the spectral slope remains too strong for Rayleigh\nscattering. The existence of the faint nearby star cannot therefore explain the\nmeasured spectral properties of this hot and inflated planet. We advocate\nfurther observations of the system, both with high spatial resolution in order\nto improve the measured properties of the faint star, and with higher spectral\nresolution to confirm the anomalous transmission spectrum of the planet. \n\n"}

Habitable planets in binaries may therefore\nexperience significant perturbations in orbit and spin. The direct effects of\norbital resonances and secular evolution on the climate of binary planets\nremain largely unconsidered.\n  We present latitudinal energy balance modelling of exoplanet climates with\ndirect coupling to an N Body integrator and an obliquity evolution model. This\nallows us to simultaneously investigate the thermal and dynamical evolution of\nplanets orbiting binary stars, and discover gravito-climatic oscillations on\ndynamical and secular timescales.\n  We investigate the Kepler-47 and Alpha Centauri systems as archetypes of P\nand S type binary systems respectively. In the first case, Earthlike planets\nwould experience rapid Milankovitch cycles (of order 1000 years) in\neccentricity, obliquity and precession, inducing temperature oscillations of\nsimilar periods (modulated by other planets in the system). These secular\ntemperature variations have amplitudes similar to those induced on the much\nshorter timescale of the binary period.\n  In the Alpha Centauri system, the influence of the secondary produces\neccentricity variations on 15,000 year timescales. This produces climate\noscillations of similar strength to the variation on the orbital timescale of\nthe binary. Phase drifts between eccentricity and obliquity oscillations\ncreates further cycles that are of order 100,000 years in duration, which are\nfurther modulated by neighbouring planets. \n\n"}

However, when trying to observe Earth\nanalogs, it is often difficult to test the veracity of detection. We have\ndeveloped a new approach to the analysis of exoplanetary spectral observations\nbased on temporal multifractality, which identifies time scales that\ncharacterize planetary orbital motion around the host star, and those that\narise from stellar features such as spots. Without fitting stellar models to\nspectral data, we show how the planetary signal can be robustly detected from\nnoisy data using noise amplitude as a source of information. For observation of\ntransiting planets, combining this method with simple geometry allows us to\nrelate the time scales obtained to primary and secondary eclipse of the\nexoplanets. Making use of data obtained with ground-based and space-based\nobservations we have tested our approach on HD 189733b. Moreover, we have\ninvestigated the use of this technique in measuring planetary orbital motion\nvia Doppler shift detection. Finally, we have analyzed synthetic spectra\nobtained using the SOAP 2.0 tool, which simulates a stellar spectrum and the\ninfluence of the presence of a planet or a spot on that spectrum over one\norbital period.

We show that the\nevolution of the internal entropy depends on the contrast between the internal\nadiabat and the entropy of the accreted material, parametrized by the shock\ntemperature $T_0$ and pressure $P_0$. At low temperatures ($T_0\\lesssim\n300$--$1000\\ {\\rm K}$, depending on model parameters), the accreted material\nhas a lower entropy than the interior.

Abstract: [Abridged] Regions of low ionisation where the activity of the\nmagneto-rotational instability is suppressed, the so-called dead zones, have\nbeen suggested to explain gaps and asymmetries of transition disks. We\ninvestigate the gas and dust evolution simultaneously assuming simplified\nprescriptions for a dead zone and a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wind acting on\nthe disk. We explore whether the resulting gas and dust distribution can create\nsignatures similar to those observed in transition disks. For the dust\nevolution, we included the transport, growth, and fragmentation of dust\nparticles. To compare with observations, we produced synthetic images in\nscattered optical light and in thermal emission at mm wavelengths. In all\nmodels with a dead zone, a bump in the gas surface density is produced that is\nable to efficiently trap large particles ($\\gtrsim 1$ mm) at the outer edge of\nthe dead zone. The gas bump reaches an amplitude of a factor of $\\sim5$, which\ncan be enhanced by the presence of an MHD wind that removes mass from the inner\ndisk. While our 1D simulations suggest that such a structure can be present\nonly for $\\sim$1 Myr, the structure may be maintained for a longer time when\nmore realistic 2D/3D simulations are performed. In the synthetic images,\ngap-like low-emission regions are seen at scattered light and in thermal\nemission at mm wavelengths, as previously predicted in the case of planet-disk\ninteraction. As a conclusion, main signatures of transition disks can be\nreproduced by assuming a dead zone in the disk, such as gap-like structure in\nscattered light and millimetre continuum emission, and a lower gas surface\ndensity within the dead zone. Previous studies showed that the Rossby wave\ninstability can also develop at the edge of such dead zones, forming vortices\nand also creating asymmetries. \n\n"}

Disc\n  Structure and Evolution Abstract: We present the results of 2-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of\nself-gravitating circumbinary discs around binaries whose parameters match\nthose of the circumbinary planet-hosting systems Kepler-16, -34 and -35.\nPrevious work has shown that non-self-gravitating discs in these systems form\nan eccentric precessing inner cavity due to tidal truncation by the binary, and\nplanets which form at large radii migrate until stalling at this cavity. While\nthis scenario appears to provide a natural explanation for the observed orbital\nlocations of the circumbinary planets, previous simulations have failed to\nmatch the observed planet orbital parameters. The aim of this work is to\nexamine the role of self-gravity in modifying circumbinary disc structure as a\nfunction of disc mass, prior to considering the evolution of embedded\ncircumbinary planets. In agreement with previous work, we find that for disc\nmasses between 1--5 times the minimum mass solar nebula (MMSN), disc\nself-gravity affects modest changes in the structure and evolution of\ncircumbinary discs. Increasing the disc mass to 10 or 20 MMSN leads to two\ndramatic changes in disc structure. First, the scale of the inner cavity\nshrinks substantially, bringing its outer edge closer to the binary. Second, in\naddition to the eccentric inner cavity, additional precessing eccentric\nring-like features develop in the outer regions of the discs.

We show that odd harmonics can, however, be\nproduced by an edge-on planet with a time-variable map, or an inclined planet\nwith a North-South (N-S) asymmetric map. Either of these scenarios entail\nweather: short-period planets are expected to have zero obliquity and hence N-S\nsymmetric stellar forcing. North-South asymmetry in a giant planet would\ntherefore suggest stochastic localized features, such as weather. However, we\nfind that previous claims of large-amplitude odd modes in Kepler photometry are\nartifacts of removing planetary transits rather than modeling them. The only\nreliable claims of odd harmonics remain HAT-P-7b and Kepler-13Ab, for which the\nthird mode amplitude is 6-8% of the planetary flux. Although time-variable\nalbedo maps could in principle explain these odd harmonics, upper-limits on the\ninfrared variability of hot Jupiters make this hypothesis unlikely. We urge\ntheorists to study the effects of close-in planets on stellar atmospheres, as\nthis remains the only plausible hypothesis. \n\n"}

High\nspatial resolution imaging revealed the star is single, and radial velocity\nmonitoring indicated that the dimming events can not be due to an eclipsing\nstellar or brown dwarf companion.

{"id": "1612.03912", "contents": "Title: Hall-effect Mediated Magnetic Flux Transport in Protoplanetary Disks Abstract: The global evolution of protoplanetary disks (PPDs) has recently been shown\nto be largely controlled by the amount of poloidal magnetic flux threading the\ndisk, which is further controlled by the poorly understood process of magnetic\nflux transport. In weakly ionized gas as in PPDs, magnetic flux is largely\nfrozen in the electron fluid, except when resistivity is large. When the disk\nis largely laminar, we show that the relative drift between the electrons and\nions (the Hall-drift), and the ions and neutral fluids (ambipolar-drift) can\nplay a dominant role on the transport of magnetic flux. Using two-dimensional\nsimulations that incorporate the Hall effect and ambipolar diffusion (AD) with\nprescribed diffusivities, we show that when large-scale poloidal field is\naligned with disk rotation, the Hall effect rapidly drags magnetic flux inward\nat the midplane region, while it slowly pushes flux outward above/below the\nmidplane. This leads to a highly radially elongated field configuration as a\nglobal manifestation of the Hall-shear instability. This field configuration\nfurther promotes rapid outward flux transport by AD at the midplane, leading to\ninstability saturation. In quasi-steady state, magnetic flux is transported\noutward at approximately the same rate at all heights, and the rate is\ncomparable to the Hall-free case. For anti-aligned field polarity, the Hall\neffect consistently transports magnetic flux outward, leading to a largely\nvertical field configuration in the midplane region. The field lines in the\nupper layer first bend radially inward and then outward to launch a disk wind.\nOverall, the net rate of outward flux transport is about twice faster than the\naligned case. In addition, the rate of flux transport increases with increasing\ndisk magnetization. The absolute rate of transport is sensitive to disk\nmicrophysics which remains to be explored in future studies. \n\n"}

We illustrate\nthat a stable equilibrium of the averaged system (a periodic orbit of the\nN-body model) is surrounded by the region of permanent resonance capture, whose\nsize depends on the migration parameters and the planets mass ratio. A system\nlocated inside this region tends towards the equilibrium (the capture is\npermanent), while a system located outside the region evolves away from the\nequilibrium and leaves the resonance.

Processes governing such deposition between the Roche radius\nand photosphere have so far received little attention and we model them here\nanalytically by extending recent work on sun-grazing comets to WD systems.

We then provide an algorithm to determine the fate of\ninfallers for any WD, and apply the algorithm to four limiting combinations of\nhot versus cool (young/old) WDs with snowy (weak, volatile) versus rocky\n(strong, refractory) infallers.

The small angular Einstein radius ($\\theta_{\\rm E}=0.12 \\pm 0.02$ mas)\nand short event timescale are typical for a low-mass lens in the Galactic\nbulge. Such low-mass planetary systems in the Bulge are rare because the\ndetection efficiency of planets in short microlensing events is relatively low.\nThis discovery may suggest that such low mass planetary systems are abundant in\nthe Bulge and currently on-going high cadence survey programs will detect more\nsuch events and may reveal an abundance of such planetary systems. \n\n"}

Investigating giant planet\n  migration history via improved eccentricity and mass determination for 231\n  transiting planets Abstract: We carried out a Bayesian homogeneous determination of the orbital parameters\nof 231 transiting giant planets (TGPs) that are alone or have distant\ncompanions; we employed DE-MCMC methods to analyse radial-velocity (RV) data\nfrom the literature and 782 new high-accuracy RVs obtained with the HARPS-N\nspectrograph for 45 systems over 3 years. Our work yields the largest sample of\nsystems with a transiting giant exoplanet and coherently determined orbital,\nplanetary, and stellar parameters. We found that the orbital parameters of TGPs\nin non-compact planetary systems are clearly shaped by tides raised by their\nhost stars. Indeed, the most eccentric planets have relatively large orbital\nseparations and/or high mass ratios, as expected from the equilibrium tide\ntheory. This feature would be the outcome of high-eccentricity migration (HEM).\nThe distribution of $\\alpha=a/a_R$, where $a$ and $a_R$ are the semi-major axis\nand the Roche limit, for well-determined circular orbits peaks at 2.5; this\nalso agrees with expectations from the HEM. The few planets of our sample with\ncircular orbits and $\\alpha >5$ values may have migrated through disc-planet\ninteractions instead of HEM. By comparing circularisation times with stellar\nages, we found that hot Jupiters with $a < 0.05$ au have modified tidal quality\nfactors $10^{5} < Q'_p < 10^{9}$, and that stellar $Q'_s > 10^{6}-10^{7}$ are\nrequired to explain the presence of eccentric planets at the same orbital\ndistance.

In low\nviscosity gas ($\\alpha\\lesssim10^{-4}$), a super-Earth opens two annular gaps\nto either side of its orbit by the action of Lindblad torques.

We find, by\napplying one dimensional torque density distributions to two dimensional discs\ncontaining no planet, that the excitement of the Rossby wave instability and\nthe formation of Rossby vortices play a critical role in setting the\nequilibrium depth of the gap. Being a two dimensional instability, this is\nabsent from one dimensional simulations and does not limit the equilibrium gap\ndepth there. We find similar gap depths between two dimensional gaps formed by\ntorque density distributions, in which the Rossby wave instability is present,\nand two dimensional planet gaps, in which no Rossby wave instability is\npresent.

We investigate here\nwhether the impact of the stellar metallicity on the evolution of the tidal\ndissipation inside the convective envelope of rotating stars and its resulting\neffect on the planetary migration might be a possible explanation for this\nobserved statistical trend.\n  We use a frequency-averaged tidal dissipation formalism coupled to an orbital\nevolution code and to rotating stellar evolution models to estimate the effect\nof a change of stellar metallicity on the evolution of close-in planets. We\nconsider here two different stellar masses: 0.4 and 1.0 $M_{\\odot}$ evolving\nfrom the early pre-main sequence phase up to the red giant branch.\n  We show that the metallicity of a star has a strong effect on the stellar\nparameters which in turn strongly influence the tidal dissipation in the\nconvective region. While on the pre-main sequence the dissipation of a metal\npoor Sun-like star is higher than the dissipation of a metal rich Sun-like\nstar, on the main sequence it is the opposite. However, for the $0.4~M_{\\odot}$\nstar, the dependence of the dissipation with metallicity is much less visible.\n  Using an orbital evolution model, we show that changing the metallicity leads\nto different orbital evolutions (e.g., planets migrate farther out from an\ninitially fast rotating metal rich star). By using this model, we qualitatively\nreproduced the observational trends of the population of hot Jupiters with the\nmetallicity of their host stars. However, more steps are needed to improve our\nmodel to try to quantitatively fit our results to the observations.

The radius distribution of the Kepler planets is\nshown to be bimodal, with a ``valley' separating two peaks at 1.3 and 2.6\nRearth. Such an ``evaporation-valley' had been predicted by numerical models\npreviously. Here, we develop a minimal model to demonstrate that this valley\nresults from the following fact: the timescale for envelope erosion is the\nlongest for those planets with hydrogen/helium-rich envelopes that, while only\na few percent in weight, double its radius. The timescale falls for envelopes\nlighter than this because the planet's radius remains largely constant for\ntenuous envelopes. The timescale also drops for heavier envelopes because the\nplanet swells up faster than the addition of envelope mass. Photoevaporation,\ntherefore, herds planets into either bare cores ~1.3 Rearth, or those with\ndouble the core's radius (~2.6 Rearth). This process mostly occurs during the\nfirst 100 Myrs when the stars' high energy flux are high and nearly constant.\nThe observed radius distribution further requires that the Kepler planets are\nclustered around 3 Mearth in mass, are born with H/He envelopes more than a few\npercent in mass, and that their cores are similar to the Earth in composition.\nSuch envelopes must have been accreted before the dispersal of the gas disks,\nwhile the core composition indicates formation inside the ice-line.

We find that\nthe population-wide imprints like the location of the \"evaporation valley\" in\nthe distance-radius plane and the corresponding bimodal radius distribution\nclearly differ depending on the bulk composition of the cores. Comparison with\nthe observed position of the valley (Fulton et al. 2017) suggests that close-in\nlow-mass Kepler planets have a predominately Earth-like rocky composition.\nCombined with the excess of period ratios outside of MMR, this suggests that\nlow-mass Kepler planets formed inside of the water iceline, but still\nundergoing orbital migration. The core radius becomes visible for planets\nlosing all primordial H/He. For planets in this \"triangle of evaporation\" in\nthe distance-radius plane, the degeneracy in compositions is reduced.

In this paper, we present submillimetre images of the thermal\nemission from debris discs that formed the SCUBA-2 Observations of Nearby Stars\n(SONS) survey, one of seven legacy surveys undertaken on the James Clerk\nMaxwell telescope between 2012 and 2015. The overall results of the survey are\npresented in the form of 850 microns (and 450 microns, where possible) images\nand fluxes for the observed fields. Excess thermal emission, over that expected\nfrom the stellar photosphere, is detected around 49 stars out of the 100\nobserved fields. The discs are characterised in terms of their flux density,\nsize (radial distribution of the dust) and derived dust properties from their\nspectral energy distributions. The results show discs over a range of sizes,\ntypically 1-10 times the diameter of the Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt in our Solar\nSystem. The mass of a disc, for particles up to a few millimetres in size, is\nuniquely obtainable with submillimetre observations and this quantity is\npresented as a function of the host stars' age, showing a tentative decline in\nmass with age. Having doubled the number of imaged discs at submillimetre\nwavelengths from ground-based, single dish telescope observations, one of the\nkey legacy products from the SONS survey is to provide a comprehensive target\nlist to observe at high angular resolution using submillimetre/millimetre\ninterferometers (e.g., ALMA, SMA). \n\n"}

Dust grains radially\ndrift due to gas--dust friction, and the gas is affected by the feedback from\ndust grains. We investigate the effects of the feedback from dust grains on the\nviscous evolution of the gas, taking into account the vertical dust settling.\nThe feedback from the grains pushes the gas outward. When the grains are small\nand the dust-to-gas mass ratio is much smaller than unity, the radial drift\nvelocity is reduced by the feedback effect but the gas still drifts inward.\nWhen the grains are sufficiently large or piled-up, the feedback is so\neffective that forces the gas flows outward. Although the dust feedback is\naffected by dust settling, we found that the 2D approximation reasonably\nreproduces the vertical averaged flux of gas and dust. We also performed the 2D\ntwo-fluid hydrodynamic simulations to examine the effect of the feedback from\nthe grains on the evolution of the gas disk. We show that when the feedback is\neffective, the gas flows outward and the gas density at the region within $\\sim\n10\\ \\mbox{AU}$ is significantly depleted. As a result, the dust-to-gas mass\nratio at the inner radii may significantly excess unity, providing the\nenvironment where planetesimals are easily formed via, e.g., streaming\ninstability.

The nongravitational effect is\ninterpreted as a perturbation of the cluster's principal, most massive\nfragment. This and other constraints suggest that the principal fragment was\nprobably 8-9 km across and the entire cluster ~150 times less massive than a\nsingle-body nucleus of an equal cross-sectional area derived from the Herschel\nfar-infrared photometry of the inactive comet detected near 30 AU from the Sun.\nThe cross-sectional area required the smallest fragments to be a few tens of\nmeters across under a steady-state distribution. The cluster was at most ~200\nkm in diameter, subject to frequent collisions and significant perturbations by\nthe Sun near perihelion, and apparently a product of tidal fragmentation of the\noriginal nucleus, more than 20 km across, at the time of close encounter with\nJupiter 4 millennia ago, if the comet's tensile strength was then as low as\nseveral Pa.

However, models of these processes are typically\ncomplex, which prevents their incorporation into observational analyses and\nstandard transit spectrum tools. In this work, we develop analytic expressions\nthat allow for the efficient parameterization of forward scattering and\nrefraction effects in transit spectra. We derive an effective slant optical\ndepth that includes a correction for forward scattered light, and present an\nanalytic form of this correction.

The study is based on the recognition that dust-gas mixtures are\ngenerically unstable to a Resonant Drag Instability (RDI), whenever the gas,\nabsent dust, supports undamped linear modes. We show that the \"streaming\ninstability\" is an RDI associated with epicyclic oscillations; this provides\nsimple interpretations for its mechanisms and accurate analytic expressions for\nits growth rates and fastest-growing wavelengths. We extend this analysis to\nmore general dust streaming motions and other waves, including buoyancy and\nmagnetohydrodynamic oscillations, finding various new instabilities. Most\nimportantly, we identify the disk \"settling instability,\" which occurs as dust\nsettles vertically into the midplane of a rotating disk. For small grains, this\ninstability grows many orders of magnitude faster than the standard streaming\ninstability, with a growth rate that is independent of grain size. Growth\ntimescales for realistic dust-to-gas ratios are comparable to the disk orbital\nperiod, and the characteristic wavelengths are more than an order of magnitude\nlarger than the streaming instability (allowing the instability to concentrate\nlarger masses). This suggests that in the process of settling, dust will band\ninto rings then filaments or clumps, potentially seeding dust traps,\nhigh-metallicity regions that in turn seed the streaming instability, or even\noverdensities that coagulate or directly collapse to planetesimals. \n\n"}

One hypothesis is that a close fly-by of\na neighbouring star was responsible for the eccentric orbit. We test this\nhypothesis. First we determine the type of fly-by that would lead to the\nobserved parameters and then use this result to determine the history of such\nfly-bys in simulations of the early dynamics in an M44-like environment. We\nfind that although very close fly-bys are required to obtain the observed\nproperties of Pr 0211c, such fly-bys are relatively common due to the high\nstellar density and longevity of the cluster. Such close fly-bys are most\nfrequent during the first 1-2 Myr after cluster formation, corresponding to a\ncluster age $\\leq$ 3 Myr. During the first 2 to 3 Myr about 6.5% of stars\nactually experience a fly-by that would lead to such a small system-size as\nobserved for Pr0211 or even smaller.

However, afterwards the close fly-by rate is\nstill 0.2-0.5 Myr$^{-1}$, which means extrapolating this to the age of M44\n12%-20% of stars would experience such close fly-bys over this timespan. Our\nsimulations show that the fly-by scenario is a realistic option for the\nformation of eccentricity orbits of the planets in M44.

In this paper, we explain the mechanism by which a planet\nexcites multiple spiral arms in a protoplanetary disk. Contrary to previous\nspeculations, the formation of both primary and additional arms can be\nunderstood as a linear process when the planet mass is sufficiently small. A\nplanet resonantly interacts with epicyclic oscillations in the disk, launching\nspiral wave modes around the Lindblad resonances. When a set of wave modes is\nin phase, they can constructively interfere with each other and create a spiral\narm. More than one spiral arm can form because such constructive interference\ncan occur for different sets of wave modes, with the exact number and launching\nposition of spiral arms dependent on the planet mass as well as the disk\ntemperature profile. Non-linear effects become increasingly important as the\nplanet mass increases, resulting in spiral arms with stronger shocks and thus\nlarger pitch angles. This is found in common for both primary and additional\narms. When a planet has a sufficiently large mass ($\\gtrsim$ 3 thermal masses\nfor $(h/r)_p=0.1$), only two spiral arms form interior to its orbit.

The extreme youth of the system (<20 Myr) gives the\nunprecedented opportunity to study the earliest phases of planetary evolution,\nat a stage when the planet is exposed to an extremely high level of high-energy\nradiation emitted by the host star.

In this context, it\nhas long been known that the presence of a gap opened by a planet can alter the\ndust dynamics significantly. In this paper, we carry out a systematic study\nemploying long-term numerical simulations aimed at characterizing the critical\nparticle-size for retention outside a gap as a function of particle size and\nfor various key parameters defining the protoplanetary disk model. To this end,\nwe perform multifluid hydrodynamical simulations in two dimensions, including\ndifferent dust species, which we treat as pressureless fluids. We initialize\nthe dust outside of the planet's orbit and study under which conditions dust\ngrains are able to cross the gap carved by the planet. In agreement with\nprevious work, we find that the permeability of the gap depends both on dust\ndynamical properties and the gas disk structure: while small dust follows the\nviscously accreting gas through the gap, dust grains approaching a critical\nsize are progressively filtered out. Moreover, we introduce and compute a\ndepletion factor that enables us to quantify the way in which higher viscosity,\nsmaller planet mass, or a more massive disk can shift this critical size to\nlarger values. Our results indicate that gap-opening planets may act to deplete\nthe inner reaches of protoplanetary disks of large dust grains -- potentially\nlimiting the accretion of solids onto forming terrestrial planets. \n\n"}

The aim of this work is to determine the values of the\ndesorption energies of formamide and methylamine from analogues of interstellar\ndust grain surfaces and to understand their interaction with water ice. TPD\nexperiments of formamide and methylamine ices were performed in the\nsubmonolayer and monolayer regimes on graphite (HOPG) and non-porous amorphous\nsolid water ice surfaces at 40-240 K. The desorption energy distributions of\nthese two molecules were calculated from TPD measurements using a set of\nindependent Polanyi-Wigner equations. The maximum of the desorption of\nformamide from both graphite and ASW ice surfaces occurs at 176 K after the\ndesorption of H2O molecules, whereas the desorption profile of methylamine\ndepends strongly on the substrate. Solid methylamine starts to desorb below 100\nK from the graphite surface. Its desorption from the water ice surface occurs\nafter 120 K and stops during the water ice sublimation around 150 K. It\ncontinues to desorb from the graphite surface at temperatures higher than 160\nK.

The\nrepercussions of a supernova can be rather profound, and the current Solar\nSystem may still bear the memory of this traumatic event. The truncation of the\nKuiper belt and the tilt of the ecliptic plane with respect to the Sun's\nrotation axis could be such signatures. We simulated the effect of a nearby\nsupernova on the young Solar System using the Astronomical Multipurpose\nSoftware Environment. Our calculations are realized in two subsequent steps in\nwhich we study the effect of the supernova irradiation on the circumstellar\ndisk and the effect of the impact of the nuclear blast-wave which arrives a few\ndecades later.

One of the observable\ntests for migration theories is the current value of the angle between the\nstellar equatorial plane and the orbital plane, called the obliquity. After the\nmain migration mechanism has ended, the obliquity and the semi-major axis keep\non evolving due to the combined effects of tides and magnetic braking. The\nobserved correlation between effective temperature and measured projected\nobliquity in known short-period systems has been taken as evidence of such\nmechanisms being at play. Our aim is to produce an improved model for the tidal\nevolution of the obliquity, including all the components of the dynamical tide\nfor circular misaligned systems. This model takes into account the strong\nvariations in structure and rotation of stars during their evolution, and their\nconsequences for the efficiency of tidal dissipation. We use an analytical\nformulation for the frequency-averaged dissipation in convective layers for\neach mode, depending only on global stellar parameters and rotation. For\ntypical hot-Jupiters orbital configurations, the obliquity is generally damped\non a much shorter timescale than the semi-major axis. The final outcome of\ntidal evolution is also very sensitive to the initial conditions, with\nJupiter-mass planets being either quickly destroyed or brought on more distant\norbit, depending on the initial ratio of planetary orbital momentum to stellar\nspin momentum. However we find that everything else being the same, the\nevolution of the obliquity around low-mass stars with a thin convective zone is\nnot slower than around those with a thicker convective zone. On the contrary,\nwe find that more massive stars, remaining faster rotator throughout their\nmain-sequence, produce more efficient dissipation. \n\n"}

We aim to\nconstrain radial differential rotation profiles in gamma Doradus (gamma Dor)\nstars, and to develop new theoretical seismic diagnosis for such stars with\nrapid and potentially non-uniform rotation. Methods. We derive a new asymptotic\ndescription which accounts for the impact of weak differential near-core\nrotation on gravity- mode period spacings. The theoretical predictions are\nillustrated from pulsation computations with the code GYRE and compared with\nobservations of gamma Dor stars. When possible, we also derive the surface\nrotation rates in these stars by detecting and analysing signatures of\nrotational modulation, and compute the core-to-surface rotation ratios.\nResults. Stellar rotation has to be strongly differential before its effects on\nperiod spacing patterns can be detected, unless multiple period spacing\npatterns can be compared.

If only one period spacing\npattern is detected and analysed for a star, it is difficult to detect\ndifferential rotation. A rigidly rotating model will often provide the best\nsolution.

Following Kenyon & Bromley (2008), it is\noften assumed that self-stirring starts to operate as soon as the first ~1000\nkm-sized embedded 'Plutos' have formed. However, state-of-the-art pebble\nconcentration models robustly predict planetesimals between a few km and ~200\nkm in size to form in protoplanetary discs rapidly, before then slowly growing\ninto Pluto-sized bodies. We show that the timescale, on which these\nplanetesimals excite the disc sufficiently for fragmentation, is shorter than\nthe formation timescale of Plutos.

We determine regions of stability\nand obtain stability maps in the (a_m,i_pm) plane, where a_m is the initial\nexolunar semimajor axis with respect to the CBP, and i_pm is the initial\ninclination of the orbit of the exomoon around the planet with respect to the\norbit of the planet around the stellar binary. Ignoring any dependence on i_pm,\nfor most Kepler CBPs the stability regions are well described by the location\nof the 1:1 mean motion commensurability of the binary orbit with the orbit of\nthe moon around the CBP. This is related to a destabilizing effect of the\nbinary compared to the case if the binary were replaced by a single body, and\nwhich is borne out by corresponding 3-body integrations. For high inclinations,\nthe evolution is dominated by Lidov-Kozai oscillations, which can bring moons\nin dynamically stable orbits to close proximity within the CBP, triggering\nstrong interactions such as tidal evolution, tidal disruption, or direct\ncollisions.

Depleting annular regions in debris discs by secular\n  resonance with a two-planet system Abstract: We investigate the evolution on secular time-scales of a radially extended\ndebris disc under the influence of a system of two coplanar planets interior to\nthe disc, showing that the secular resonances of the system can produce a\ndepleted region in the disc by exciting the eccentricities of planetesimals.\nUsing Laplace-Lagrange theory, we consider how the two exterior secular\nresonance locations, time-scales and widths depend on the masses, semi-major\naxes and eccentricities of the planets. In particular, we find that unless the\nresonances are very close to each other, one of them is very narrow and\ntherefore unimportant for determining the observable structure of the disc. We\napply these considerations to the debris disc of HD 107146, identifying\ncombinations of the parameters of a possible unobserved two-planet system that\ncould configure the secular resonances appropriately to reproduce the depletion\nobserved in the disc. By performing N-body simulations of such systems, we find\nthat planetesimal eccentricities do indeed become large near the theoretical\nsecular resonance locations. The N-body output is post-processed to set the\ninitial surface density profile of the disc, and to include the possible\neffects of collisional depletion. We find that it is possible to obtain a\ndouble-ringed disc in these simulations but not an axisymmetric one, with the\ninner ring having an offset whose magnitude depends on the eccentricities of\nthe planets, and the outer ring showing spiral structure. \n\n"}

For\nthe formation process of glycine on the grain surface, we obtained consistent\nresults with previous studies that glycine would be formed via the reactions of\nCOOH with CH$_2$NH$_2$. However, we will report three important findings\nregarding the chemical evolution and the detectability of interstellar glycine.\nFirst, with the experimentally obtained binding energy from the temperature\nprogrammed thermal desorption (TPD) experiment, a large proportion of glycine\nwas destroyed through the grain surface reactions with NH or CH$_3$O radicals\nbefore it fully evaporates. As a result, the formation process in the gas phase\nis more important than thermal evaporation from grains. If this is the case,\nNH$_2$OH and CH$_3$COOH rather than CH$_3$NH$_2$ and CH$_2$NH would be the\nessential precursors to the gas phase glycine. Secondly, since the gas phase\nglycine will be quickly destroyed by positive ions or radicals, early\nevolutionary phase of the hot cores would be the preferable target for the\nfuture glycine surveys. Thirdly, we suggest the possibility that the\nsuprathermal hydrogen atoms can strongly accelerate the formation of COOH\nradicals from CO$_2$, resulting in the dramatic increase of formation rate of\nglycine on grains. The efficiency of this process should be investigated in\ndetail by theoretical and experimental studies in the future. \n\n"}

The performances of the proposed method are compared\nto the commonly employed Normal density using both simulations and real\nobservations, with different levels of activity and signal-to-noise ratio. When\nconsidering real observations, the correlation between the RV and the asymmetry\nof the CCF and between the RV and the width of the CCF are stronger when using\nthe parameters estimated with the SN density rather than the ones obtained with\nthe commonly employed Normal density. Using the proposed SN approach, the\nuncertainties estimated on the RV defined as the median of the SN are on\naverage 10% smaller than the uncertainties calculated on the mean of the\nNormal. The uncertainties estimated on the asymmetry parameter of the SN are on\naverage 15% smaller than the uncertainties measured on the Bisector Inverse\nSlope Span (BIS SPAN), which is the commonly used parameter to evaluate the\nasymmetry of the CCF.

Based on simple\nsimulations, we were able to demonstrate that this new model improves the\nplanetary detection limits by 12% compared to the model commonly used to\naccount for stellar activity. The SN density is a better model than the Normal\ndensity for characterizing the CCF since the correlations used to probe stellar\nactivity are stronger and the uncertainties of the RV estimate and the\nasymmetry of the CCF are both smaller. \n\n"}

The satellite orbits Daphne on an equatorial, quasi-circular, prograde\norbit, like the satellites of many other large main-belt asteroids. The shape\nmodel of Daphne reveals several large flat areas that could be large impact\ncraters.

As a necessity to reduce the data volume, flagged samples are\ntypically (implicitly) interpolated during time or frequency averaging or\nuv-gridding. This so-far unexplored systematic biases the 21-cm power spectrum,\nand it is important to understand this bias for current 21-cm experiments as\nwell as the upcoming SKA Epoch of Reionization experiment.

The\noptically thin CO (J=3-2) emission is co-located with previously identified\ndust emission from the belt, and the emission velocity structure is consistent\nwith Keplerian rotation around the central star.

The analysis of data\nobtained within an intensive observing campaign demonstrates that the excess\ndispersion is due to a coherent signal, with a period of 15.53 d. Almost\nsimultaneous photometric observations were carried out within the APACHE and\nEXORAP programs to characterize the stellar activity and to distinguish\nperiodic variations related to activity from signals due to the presence of\nplanetary companions, complemented also with ASAS photometric data. We took\nadvantage of the available radial velocity measurements for this target from\nother observing campaigns. The analysis of the radial velocity composite time\nseries from the HIRES, HARPS and HARPS-N spectrographs, consisting of 198\nmeasurements taken over 20 years, enabled us to address the nature of periodic\nsignals and also to characterize stellar physical parameters (mass,\ntemperature, and rotation). We report the discovery of a super-Earth orbiting\nat a distance of 0.092 AU from the host star Gl 686. Gl 686 b has a minimum\nmass of 7.1 +/- 0.9 MEarth and an orbital period of 15.532 +/- 0.002 d. The\nanalysis of the activity indexes, correlated noise through a Gaussian process\nframework and photometry, provides an estimate of the stellar rotation period\nat 37 d, and highlights the variability of the spot configuration during the\nlong timespan covering 20 yrs. The observed periodicities around 2000 d likely\npoint to the existence of an activity cycle. \n\n"}

They\npose challenges to the usual interior rubble-pile structure unless a relatively\nhigh bulk density is assumed. So far, only six large SFRs have been found.\nTherefore, we present a survey of asteroid rotation period using Pan-STARRS 1\ntelescopes during 2016 October 26 to 31 to search more large SFRs and study\ntheir properties. A total of 876 reliable rotation periods are measured, among\nwhich seven are large SFRs, thereby increasing the inventory of known large\nSFRs. These seven newly discovered large SFRs have diverse colors and locations\nin the main asteroid belt, suggesting that the taxonomic tendency and the\nlocation preference in the inner main belt of the six perviously known large\nSFRs could be a bias due to various observational limits. Interestingly, five\nout of the seven newly discovered large SFRs are mid main-belt asteroids.\nConsidering the rare discovery rates of large SFR in the previously similar\nsurveys (Chang et al., 2015, 2016) and the survey condition in this work, the\nchance of detecting a large SFR in the inner main belt seems to be relatively\nlow. This probably suggests that the inner main belt harbors less large SFRs\nthan the mid main belt.

This is due to a geometrical effect,\nappearing when certain types of average densities are calculated along the past\nlight cone. The paper starts reviewing the argument concerning the possibility\nthat the galaxy distribution follows such a scaling pattern, and the premises\nbehind the assumption that the spatial homogeneity of standard cosmology can be\nobservable. Next, it is argued that to discuss observable homogeneity one needs\nto make a clear distinction between local and average relativistic densities,\nand showing how the different distance definitions strongly affect them,\nleading the various average densities to display asymptotically opposite\nbehaviours. Then the paper revisits Ribeiro's (1995: astro-ph/9910145) results,\nshowing that in a fully relativistic treatment some observational average\ndensities of the flat Friedmann model are not well defined at z ~ 0.1, implying\nthat at this range average densities behave in a fundamentally different manner\nas compared to the linearity of the Hubble law, well valid for z < 1. This\nconclusion brings into question the widespread assumption that relativistic\ncorrections can always be neglected at low z. It is also shown how some key\nfeatures of fractal cosmologies can be found in the Friedmann models. In view\nof those findings, it is suggested that the so-called contradiction between the\ncosmological principle, and the galaxy distribution forming an unlimited\nfractal structure, may not exist. \n\n"}

The luminosity distributions of the sources in the inner 60 arcsec\nregion (nucleus and stellar bar) is a single power law, which we interpret as\ndue to continuous, ongoing star formation.

We calculate a\nprobability distribution for the redshift of each galaxy, which includes a\ndetailed treatment of the observational errors and uncertainties in the\nevolutionary model. The cumulative redshift distribution of the submillimetre\ngalaxy population that we present in this paper, based on 50 galaxies found in\nwide-area SCUBA surveys, is asymmetric, and broader than those published\nelsewhere, with a significant high-z tail for some of the evolutionary models\nconsidered. Approximately 40 to 90 per cent of the sub-mm population is\nexpected to have redshifts in the interval 2 < z < 4. Whilst this result is\ncompletely consistent with earlier estimates for the sub-mm galaxy population,\nwe also show that the colours of many (< 50 per cent) individual sub-mm\nsources, detected only at 850um with non-detections at other wavelengths, are\nconsistent with those of starburst galaxies that lie at extreme redshifts, z >\n4.

A wide range of potential systematic\neffects are explicitly controlled by independently deriving the mean cluster\nmass profile (finding good agreement with theoretical predictions), the cluster\nlight profile, the redshift evolution of both cluster and field galaxies, the\ndifferential evolution between the two, and the field and cluster efficiencies\nfor the conversion of baryons into galaxies. We conclude that\nOmega_M=0.19+/-0.06 where the errors are objectively evaluated via resampling\nmethods. The redshift evolution of the numbers of clusters per unit co-moving\nvolume over the 0< z < 0.6 range is found to be very slow, as is required for\nconsistency with a low density universe. The evolution of galaxy clustering in\nthe field is compatible with a low density universe, and strongly disfavors\nmodels of galaxy evolution that associate low density halos with individual\ngalaxies. \n\n"}

Multi-component models accounting for Comptonization\nby thermal and non-thermal electrons, Compton reflection of X/gamma-rays from\ncold matter, and emission of the optically thick accretion disk are required.\nIn this review, I discuss recent advances in the spectral modeling of Galactic\nblack holes and Seyferts and the codes available for such an analysis. \n\n"}
{"id": "gr-qc/0306013", "contents": "Title: Electromagnetic Generators and Detectors of Gravitational Waves Abstract: The renewed serious interest to possible practical applications of\ngravitational waves is encouraging. Building on previous work, I am arguing\nthat the strong variable electromagnetic fields are appropriate systems for the\ngeneration and detection of high-frequency gravitational waves (HFGW). The\nadvantages of electromagnetic systems are clearly seen in the proposed complete\nlaboratory experiment, where one has to ensure the efficiency of, both, the\nprocess of generation and the process of detection of HFGW. Within the family\nof electromagnetic systems, one still has a great variety of possible\ngeometrical configurations, classical and quantum states of the electromagnetic\nfield, detection strategies, etc. According to evaluations performed 30 years\nago, the gap between the HFGW laboratory signal and its level of detectability\nis at least 4 orders of magnitude. Hopefully, new technologies of today can\nremove this gap and can make the laboratory experiment feasible. The laboratory\nexperiment is bound to be expensive, but one should remember that a part of the\ncost is likely to be reimbursed from the Nobel prize money ! Electromagnetic\nsystems seem also appropriate for the detection of high-frequency end of the\nspectrum of relic gravitational waves. Although the current effort to observe\nthe stochastic background of relic gravitational waves is focused on the\nopposite, very low-frequency, end of the spectrum, it would be extremely\nvaluable for fundamental science to detect, or put sensible upper limits on,\nthe high-frequency relic gravitational waves. I will briefly discuss the origin\nof relic gravitational waves, the expected level of their high-frequency\nsignal, and the existing estimates of its detectability. \n\n"}

However, over the last few years, the zoo of cosmological\nsingularities considered in the literature has become considerably more\nextensive, with \"big rips\" and \"sudden singularities\" added to the mix, as well\nas renewed interest in non-singular cosmological events such as \"bounces\" and\n\"turnarounds\".\n  In this article we present a complete catalogue of such cosmological\nmilestones, both at the kinematical and dynamical level. First, using\ngeneralized power series, purely kinematical definitions of these cosmological\nevents are provided in terms of the behaviour of the scale factor a(t). The\nnotion of a \"scale-factor singularity'\" is defined, and its relation to\ncurvature singularities (polynomial and differential) is explored. Second,\ndynamical information is extracted by using the Friedmann equations (without\nassuming even the existence of any equation of state) to place constraints on\nwhether or not the classical energy conditions are satisfied at the\ncosmological milestones. We use these considerations to derive necessary and\nsufficient conditions for the existence of cosmological milestones such as\nbangs, bounces, crunches, rips, sudden singularities, and extremality events.\nSince the classification is extremely general, the corresponding results are to\na high degree model-independent: In particular, we provide a complete\ncharacterization of the class of bangs, crunches, and sudden singularities for\nwhich the dominant energy condition is satisfied. \n\n"}
{"id": "gr-qc/0702082", "contents": "Title: Cosmic clocks, cosmic variance and cosmic averages Abstract: Cosmic acceleration is explained quantitatively, purely in general\nrelativity, as an apparent effect due to quasilocal gravitational energy\ndifferences that arise in the decoupling of bound systems from the global\nexpansion of the universe. \"Dark energy\" is recognised as a misidentification\nof those aspects of gravitational energy which by virtue of the equivalence\nprinciple cannot be localised, namely gradients in the energy associated with\nthe expansion of space and spatial curvature variations in an inhomogeneous\nuniverse, as we observe. Gravitational energy differences between observers in\nbound systems, such as galaxies, and volume-averaged comoving locations within\nvoids in freely expanding space can be so large that the time dilation between\nthe two significantly affects the parameters of any effective homogeneous\nisotropic model one fits to the universe. A new approach to cosmological\naveraging is presented, which implicitly solves the Sandage-de Vaucouleurs\nparadox. When combined with a nonlinear scheme for cosmological evolution with\nback-reaction via the Buchert equations, a new observationally viable\nquantitative model of the universe is obtained. The expansion age is increased,\nallowing more time for structure formation. The baryon density fraction\nobtained from primordial nucleosynthesis bounds can be significantly larger,\nyet consistent with primordial lithium abundance measurements. The angular\nscale of the first Doppler peak in the CMB anisotropy spectrum fits the new\nmodel despite an average negative spatial curvature at late epochs, resolving\nthe anomaly associated with ellipticity in the CMB anisotropies. A number of\nother testable consequences are discussed, with the potential to profoundly\nchange the whole of theoretical and observational cosmology. [Abridged] \n\n"}

One can try to improve in this aspect in a\nnumber of ways. For instance, it has been suggested to employ a field whose\nkinetic term is not sign definite, in the hope that the background may be\noverall stable. We show that this is not the case; the physical perturbations\n(gravity included) of the system do not extend across the zeros of the kinetic\nterm; hence, all the modes are entirely localized either where the kinetic term\nis positive, or where it is negative; this second type of modes are ghosts. We\nshow that this conclusion does not depend on the specific choice for the\nkinetic and potential functions for the bulk scalar. \n\n"}
