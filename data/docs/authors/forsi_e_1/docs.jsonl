The\nmodels are based either on brane cosmologies or on Liouville strings in which a\nrelaxation dark energy is provided by a rolling dilaton field (Q-cosmology). An\ninteresting feature of such cosmologies is the possibility of effective\nfour-dimensional negative-energy dust and/or exotic scaling of dark matter. An\nimportant constraint that can discriminate among models is the evolution of the\nHubble parameter as a function of the redshift, H(z). We perform fits using a\nunifying formula for the evolution of H(z), applicable to different models. We\nfind evidence for a negative-energy dust at the current era, as well as for\nexotic-scaling (a^{-delta}) contributions to the energy density, with\n3.3<delta<4.3. The latter could be due to dark matter coupling with the dilaton\nin Q-cosmology models, but it is also compatible with the possibility of dark\nradiation from a brane Universe to the bulk in brane-world scenarios, which\ncould also encompass Q-cosmology models.

Regarding the question of\norigin, the main difficulty has been the fact that within the classical general\nrelativistic framework, the `origin' is almost always a singular event at which\nthe laws of physics break down, thus making it impossible for such an event, or\nepochs prior to it, to be studied. Recent studies have shown that Loop Quantum\nCosmology may provide a non-singular framework where these questions can be\naddressed. The crucial role here is played by quantum effects, i.e.\\\ncorrections to the classical equations of motion, which are incorporated in\neffective equations employed to develop cosmological scenarios.\n  In this chapter we shall consider the three main types of quantum effects\nexpected to be present within such a framework and discuss some of their\nconsequences for the effective equations.

The latter\ninvolves point-like brane defects (D-particles), which provide the\ntopologically non-trivial foamy structures of space-time. A stochastic Langevin\nequation for the velocity recoil of D-particles can be derived from the pinched\napproximation for a sum over genera in the calculation of the partition\nfunction of a bosonic string in the presence of heavy D-particles. The string\ncoupling in standard perturbation theory is related to the exponential of the\nexpectation of the dilaton. Inclusion of fluctuations of the dilaton itself and\nuncertainties in the string background will then necessitate fluctuations in\n$g_{s}$. The fluctuation in the string coupling in the sum over genera\ntypically leads to a generic structure of the Langevin equation where the\ncoefficient of the noise term, dependent on the string coupling $g_{s}$,\nfluctuates. The positivity of $g_{s}$ leads naturally to a stochastic modelling\nof its distribution with a $\\chi$- distribution.

When $\\alpha<1/2$, the RDE will exhibit a quintom feature, i.e., the\nequation of state of dark energy will evolve across the cosmological constant\nboundary $w=-1$. Observations show that the parameter $\\alpha$ is indeed\nsmaller than 1/2, so the late-time evolution of RDE will be really like a\nphantom energy. Therefore, it seems that the big rip is inevitable in this\nmodel. On the other hand, the big rip is actually inconsistent with the\ntheoretical framework of the holographic model of dark energy. To avoid the big\nrip, we appeal to the extra dimension physics. In this Letter, we investigate\nthe cosmological evolution of the RDE in the braneworld cosmology.

An adiabatic feedback mechanism was adopted where gas cooling\nwas prevented to generate galactic winds without explicit wind particles. The\nsimulations produced a cosmic star formation history (SFH) that is broadly\nconsistent with observations until z $\\sim$ 0.5, and a steady evolution of the\nuniversal neutral hydrogen fraction ($\\Omega_{\\rm H I}$). At z=0, about 40% of\nthe baryons are in the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM), but most metals\n(80%-90%) are locked in stars. At higher z the proportion of metals in the IGM\nis higher due to more efficient loss from galaxies. The IGM metals primarily\nreside in the WHIM throughout cosmic history. The metallicity evolution of the\ngas inside galaxies is broadly consistent with observations, but the diffuse\nIGM is under enriched at z $\\sim$ 2.5. Galactic winds most efficiently enrich\nthe IGM for halos in the intermediate mass range $10^{10}$M$_{\\sun}$ -\n$10^{11}$ M$_{\\sun}$. At the low mass end gas is prevented from accreting onto\nhalos and has very low metallicities. At the high mass end, the fraction of\nhalo baryons escaped as winds declines along with the decline of stellar mass\nfraction of the galaxies. This is likely because of the decrease in star\nformation activity and in wind escape efficiency. Metals enhance cooling which\nallows WHIM gas to cool onto galaxies and increases star formation. Metal\ndiffusion allows winds to mix prior to escape, decreasing the IGM metal content\nin favour of gas within galactic halos and star forming gas. Diffusion\nsignificantly increases the amount of gas with low metallicities and changes\nthe density-metallicity relation. \n\n"}

We study this system by solving the Einstein-Maxwell\nequations in which the EM fields are chosen with astrophysically consistent\nstrengths. We consider binaries with spins aligned or anti-aligned with the\norbital angular momentum and study the dependence of gravitational and EM\nsignals with these spin configurations. Overall we find that the EM radiation\nin the lowest l=2, m=2 multipole accurately reflects the gravitational one,\nwith identical phase evolutions and amplitudes that differ only by a scaling\nfactor. We also compute the efficiency of the energy emission in EM waves and\nfind that it is given by E^rad_EM/M ~ 10^-15 (M/10^8 M_Sun)^2 (B/10^4 G)^2,\nhence 13 orders of magnitude smaller than the gravitational energy for\nrealistic magnetic fields.

In the more interesting\ncase of codimension-2, after selecting a local null frame, this deformation\nequation reduces to the well known (cross) focusing equations. We show how the\nthermodynamics of trapping horizons is related to these deformation equations\nin two different formalisms: with and without introducing quasilocal energy. In\nthe formalism with the quasilocal energy, the Hawking mass in four dimension is\ngeneralized to higher dimension, and it is found that the deformation of this\nenergy inside a marginal surface can be also decomposed into the contributions\nfrom matter fields and gravitational radiation as in the four dimension.

First we study $S_C$\nin $d+1$ dimensional Minkowski spacetime.

We\ncombine the population synthesis code Starburst99 with a semi-analytical model\nof galactic outflows and a model for the distribution and abundances of\nchemical elements inside the outflows. Starting with a galaxy mass, formation\nredshift, and adopting a particular form for the star formation rate, we\ndescribe the evolution of the stellar populations in the galaxy, the evolution\nof the metallicity and chemical composition of the interstellar medium (ISM),\nthe propagation of the galactic wind, and the metal-enrichment of the\nintergalactic medium (IGM). In this paper, we study the properties of the\nmodel, by varying the mass of the galaxy, the star formation rate, and the\nefficiency of star formation. Our main results are the following: (1) For a\ngiven star formation efficiency f*, a more extended period of active star\nformation tends to produce a galactic wind that reaches a larger extent. If f*\nis sufficiently large, the energy deposited by the stars completely expels the\nISM. Eventually, the ISM is being replenished by mass loss from supernovae and\nstellar winds. (2) For galaxies with masses above 10^11 Msun, the material\nejected in the IGM always falls back onto the galaxy. Hence lower-mass galaxies\nare the ones responsible for enriching the IGM. (3) Stellar winds play a minor\nrole in the dynamical evolution of the galactic wind, because their energy\ninput is small compared to supernovae. However, they contribute significantly\nto the chemical composition of the galactic wind. We conclude that the history\nof the ISM enrichment plays a determinant role in the chemical composition and\nextent of the galactic wind, and therefore its ability to enrich the IGM. \n\n"}

The\nChimera scheme is a hybrid method that combines tools from different\napproximation techniques in General Relativity: (i) A multipolar,\npost-Minkowskian expansion for the far-zone metric perturbation (the\ngravitational waveforms) and for the local prescription of the self-force; (ii)\na post-Newtonian expansion for the computation of the multipole moments in\nterms of the trajectories; and (iii) a BH perturbation theory expansion when\ntreating the trajectories as a sequence of self-adjusting Kerr geodesics.

Despite infinite tidal forces the geodesics pass through the\nsingularity. Due to the dust component, the Hubble parameter has a non-zero\nvalue at the encounter with the singularity, therefore the dust implies further\nexpansion. With continued expansion however, the energy density and the\npressure of the anti-Chaplygin gas would become ill-defined, hence from the\npoint of view of the anti-Chaplygin gas only a contraction is allowed.\nParadoxically, the universe in this cosmological model would have to expand and\ncontract simultaneously. This obviosly could not happen. We solve the paradox\nby redefining the anti-Chaplygin gas in a distributional sense.

Stationary Black Holes Abstract: When one splits spacetime into space plus time, the Weyl curvature tensor\n(which equals the Riemann tensor in vacuum) splits into two spatial, symmetric,\ntraceless tensors: the tidal field $E$, which produces tidal forces, and the\nframe-drag field $B$, which produces differential frame dragging. In recent\npapers, we and colleagues have introduced ways to visualize these two fields:\ntidal tendex lines (integral curves of the three eigenvector fields of $E$) and\ntheir tendicities (eigenvalues of these eigenvector fields); and the\ncorresponding entities for the frame-drag field: frame-drag vortex lines and\ntheir vorticities. These entities fully characterize the vacuum Riemann tensor.\nIn this paper, we compute and depict the tendex and vortex lines, and their\ntendicities and vorticities, outside the horizons of stationary (Schwarzschild\nand Kerr) black holes; and we introduce and depict the black holes' horizon\ntendicity and vorticity (the normal-normal components of $E$ and $B$ on the\nhorizon). For Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes, the horizon tendicity is\nproportional to the horizon's intrinsic scalar curvature, and the horizon\nvorticity is proportional to an extrinsic scalar curvature. We show that, for\nhorizon-penetrating time slices, all these entities ($E$, $B$, the tendex lines\nand vortex lines, the lines' tendicities and vorticities, and the horizon\ntendicities and vorticities) are affected only weakly by changes of slicing and\nchanges of spatial coordinates, within those slicing and coordinate choices\nthat are commonly used for black holes.

Abstract: We investigate the large-scale clustering and gravitational interaction of\nbaryons and dark matter (DM) over cosmic time using a set of collisionless\nN-body simulations. Both components, baryons and DM, are evolved from distinct\nprimordial density and velocity power spectra as predicted by early-universe\nphysics. We first demonstrate that such two-component simulations require an\nunconventional match between force and mass resolution (i.e. force softening on\nat least the mean particle separation scale). Otherwise, the growth on any\nscale is not correctly recovered because of a spurious coupling between the two\nspecies at the smallest scales. With these simulations, we then demonstrate how\nthe primordial differences in the clustering of baryons and DM are\nprogressively diminished over time. In particular, we explicitly show how the\nBAO signature is damped in the spatial distribution of baryons and imprinted in\nthat of DM. This is a rapid process, yet it is still not fully completed at low\nredshifts. On large scales, the overall shape of the correlation function of\nbaryons and DM differs by 2% at z = 9 and by 0.2% at z = 0. The differences in\nthe amplitude of the BAO peak are approximately a factor of 5 larger: 10% at z\n= 9 and 1% at z = 0. These discrepancies are, however, smaller than effects\nexpected to be introduced by galaxy formation physics in both the shape of the\npower spectrum and in the BAO peak, and are thus unlikely to be detected given\nthe precision of the next generation of galaxy surveys.

We find that, with\nthe currently measured proper motions and radial velocity of M31, MOND would\nimply that the Milky Way and M31 first moved apart via Hubble expansion after\nbirth, but then necessarily got attracted again by the Milgromian gravitational\nattraction, and had a past fly-by encounter before coming to their present\npositions.

Favorable conditions for merger are initiated by the Kozai\nresonance in which the gravitational interaction with a third distant object,\ntypically another BH, induces quasi-periodic variations of the inner BH binary\neccentricity. In this paper we perform high precision N-body simulations of the\nlong term evolution of hierarchical BH triples and investigate the conditions\nthat lead to the merging of the BH binary and the way it might become an\nobservable source of GW radiation. We find that the secular orbit average\ntreatment, adopted in previous works, does not reliably describe the dynamics\nof these systems if the binary is orbited by the outer BH on a highly inclined\norbit at a moderate distance. During the high eccentricity phase of a Kozai\ncycle the torque due to the outer BH can drive the binary to extremely large\neccentricities in a fraction of the binary's orbital period. This occurs before\nrelativistic terms become important to the evolution and allows the binary GW\nsignal to reach large GW frequencies (>~10 Hz) at high eccentricities.

Thus this answer is additionally a\nclassical-level resolution of the spacetime reconstruction problem. In this\napproach, mere consistency imposed by the Dirac procedure whittles down a\ngeneral ansatz to one of four alternatives: Lorentzian, Galilean, or Carrollian\nrelativity, or constant mean curvature slicing.

In this study, we use a non-periodic\ncomputational box, the jet flow is initially established across the\ncomputational grid, and a precessional perturbation at the inlet triggers\ngrowth of the kink instability. If the velocity shear radius is located inside\nthe characteristic radius of the helical magnetic field, a static\nnon-propagating current driven kink is excited as the perturbation propagates\ndown the jet. Temporal growth disrupts the initial flow across the\ncomputational grid not too far from the inlet.

One promising avenue is to modify general\nrelativity and obtain a new description of the gravitational force. Because\ngravitation dominates the other forces mostly on large scales, cosmological\nprobes provide an ideal testing ground for theories of gravity. In this thesis,\nwe describe two complementary approaches to the problem of testing gravity\nusing cosmology.\n  In the first part, we discuss the cosmological solutions of massive gravity\nand its generalisation to a bimetric theory. These theories describe a graviton\nwith a small mass, and can potentially explain the late-time acceleration in a\ntechnically-natural way. We describe these self-accelerating solutions and\ninvestigate the cosmological perturbations in depth, beginning with an\ninvestigation of their linear stability, followed by the construction of a\nmethod for solving these perturbations in the quasistatic limit. This allows\nthe predictions of stable bimetric models to be compared to observations of\nstructure formation.

Dynamical capture mergers may take place in globular clusters, as\nwell as other dense stellar systems, where most neutron stars have large spins.\nWe find significant variability in the merger outcome as a function of initial\nneutron star spin. For cases where the spin is aligned with the orbital angular\nmomentum, the additional centrifugal support in the remnant hypermassive\nneutron star can prevent the prompt collapse to a black hole, while for\nantialigned cases the decreased total angular momentum can facilitate the\ncollapse to a black hole. We show that even moderate spins can significantly\nincrease the amount of ejected material, including the amount unbound with\nvelocities greater than half the speed of light, leading to brighter\nelectromagnetic signatures associated with kilonovae and interaction of the\nejecta with the interstellar medium.

We also deduce the exact\nLense-Thirring (LT) precession frequency of a test gyroscope moving toward a\nrotating traversable Teo wormhole. The precession frequency diverges on the\nergoregion, a behavior intimately related to and governed by the geometry of\nthe ergoregion, analogous to the situation in a Kerr spacetime. Interestingly,\nit turns out that here the LT precession is inversely proportional to the\nangular momentum ($a$) of the wormhole along the pole and around it in the\nstrong gravity regime, a behavior contrasting with its direct variation with\n$a$ in the case of other compact objects. In fact, divergence of LT precession\ninside the ergoregion can also be avoided if the gyro moves with a non-zero\nangular velocity in a certain range.

If not accounted for, even a small orbital eccentricity can cause a\npotentially significant systematic error in the mass parameters of an\ninspiralling binary. Gravitational-wave search templates typically rely on the\nquasi-circular approximation, which provides relatively simple expressions for\nthe gravitational-wave phase to 3.5 post-Newtonian (PN) order. The\nquasi-Keplerian formalism provides an elegant but complex description of the\npost-Newtonian corrections to the orbits and waveforms of inspiralling binaries\nwith any eccentricity.

In this limit the non-periodic contribution to\nthe gravitational-wave phasing can be expressed explicitly as simple functions\nof frequency or time, with little additional complexity beyond the well-known\nformulas for circular binaries.

Based on\nthe map between classical Poisson brackets and their associated commutators,\nsuch schemes give rise to quantum states obeying canonical dispersion\nrelations, obtained by substituting the de Broglie relations into the relevant\n(classical) energy-momentum relation. In canonical QM, this yields a dispersion\nrelation involving $\\hbar$ but not $c$, whereas the canonical relativistic\ndispersion relation involves both. Extending this logic to the canonical\nquantization of the gravitational field gives rise to loop quantum gravity, and\na map between classical variables containing $G$ and $c$, and associated\ncommutators involving $\\hbar$. This naturally defines a \"wave-gravity duality\",\nsuggesting that a quantum wave packet describing {\\it self-gravitating matter}\nobeys a dispersion relation involving $G$, $c$ and $\\hbar$.

It was shown recently that for gyros\nattached to static observers, their precession frequency became arbitrarily\nlarge in the limit of approach to the ergosurface. For gyros attached to\nstationary observers that move with non-zero angular velocity $\\Omega$, this\ndivergence at the ergosurface can be avoided. Specifically, for such gyros, the\nprecession frequencies diverge on the event horizon of a BH, but are finite and\nregular for NS everywhere except at the singularity itself. Therefore a genuine\ndetection of the event horizon becomes possible in this case. We also show that\nfor a near-extremal NS ($1<a_* < 1.1$), characteristic features appear in the\nradial profiles of the precession frequency, using which we can further\ndistinguish a near-extremal NS from a BH, or even from NS with larger angular\nmomentum.

The asymptotic symmetries are spanned\nby an extension of the super-BMS$_3$ algebra, with two independent $\\hat{u}(1)$\ncurrents of electric and magnetic type.

Remarkably, although the\n$U(1)$ fields do not generate a backreaction on the metric, they provide\nnontrivial Sugawara-like contributions to the BMS$_3$ generators, and hence to\nthe energy and the angular momentum. The entropy of flat cosmological\nspacetimes with $U(1)$ fields then acquires a nontrivial dependence on the\n$\\hat{u}(1)$ charges. If the spin structure is odd, the ground state\ncorresponds to Minkowski spacetime, and although the anticommutator of the\ncanonical supercharges is linear in the energy and in the electric-like\n$\\hat{u}(1)$ charge, the energy becomes bounded from below by the energy of the\nground state shifted by the square of the electric-like $\\hat{u}(1)$ charge.

Stellar-mass primordial black holes\n(PBHs) are subject to less robust constraints than other mass ranges and might\nbe connected to gravitational-wave signals detected by the Laser Interferometer\nGravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO).

We discuss how these\nresults and other observations support two conclusions: $1)$ starting from the\nKerr limit, the increase of hair for fixed coupling $\\mu M$ (where $M$ is the\nBH mass) increases the timescale of the instability; $2)$ there are hairy\nsolutions for which this timescale, for astrophysical black hole masses, is\nlarger than the age of the Universe. The latter conclusion introduces the\nlimited, but physically relevant concept of effective stability. The former\nconclusion, allows us to identify an astrophysically viable domain of such\neffectively stable hairy black holes, occurring, conservatively, for $M\\mu\n\\lesssim 0.25$. These are hairy BHs that form dynamically, from the\nsuperradiant instability of Kerr, within an astrophysical timescale, but whose\nown superradiant instability occurs only in a cosmological timescale. \n\n"}

Among the most promising agents of feedback are cosmic rays (CRs),\nthe relativistic ion population of interstellar and intergalactic plasmas. In\nthese environments, energetic CRs are virtually collisionless and interact via\ncollective phenomena mediated by kinetic-scale plasma waves and large-scale\nmagnetic fields. The enormous separation of kinetic and global astrophysical\nscales requires a hydrodynamic description. Here, we develop a new macroscopic\ntheory for CR transport in the self-confinement picture, which includes CR\ndiffusion and streaming. The interaction between CRs and electromagnetic fields\nof Alfv\\'enic turbulence provides the main source of CR scattering, and causes\nCRs to stream along the magnetic field with the Alfv\\'en velocity if resonant\nwaves are sufficiently energetic. However, numerical simulations struggle to\ncapture this effect with current transport formalisms and adopt regularization\nschemes to ensure numerical stability. We extent the theory by deriving an\nequation for the CR momentum density along the mean magnetic field and include\na transport equation for the Alfv\\'en-wave energy. We account for energy\nexchange of CRs and Alfv\\'en waves via the gyroresonant instability and include\nother wave damping mechanisms. Using numerical simulations we demonstrate that\nour new theory enables stable, self-regulated CR transport. The theory is\ncoupled to magneto-hydrodynamics, conserves the total energy and momentum, and\ncorrectly recovers previous macroscopic CR transport formalisms in the\nsteady-state flux limit. Because it is free of tunable parameters, it holds the\npromise to provide predictable simulations of CR feedback in galaxy formation. \n\n"}

Unfortunately, Boltzmann's equations of\nradiation transport remain too costly to be evolved directly in merger\nsimulations.

In this paper, we use for the first time a\ntime-dependent general relativistic Monte-Carlo (MC) algorithm to solve\nBoltzmann's equations and estimate important properties of the neutrino\ndistribution function ~10ms after a neutron star merger. We do not fully couple\nthe MC algorithm to the fluid evolution, but use a short evolution of the\nmerger remnant to critically assess errors in our approximate gray two-moment\ntransport scheme. We demonstrate that the analytical closure used by the moment\nscheme is highly inaccurate in the polar regions, but performs well elsewhere.\nWhile the average energy of polar neutrinos is reasonably well captured by the\ntwo-moment scheme, estimates for the neutrino energy become less accurate at\nlower latitudes. The two-moment formalism also overestimates the density of\nneutrinos in the polar regions by ~50%, and underestimates the neutrino\npair-annihilation rate at the poles by factors of 2-3. Although the latter is\nsignificantly more accurate than one might have expected before this study, our\nresults indicate that predictions for the properties of polar outflows and for\nthe creation of a baryon-free region at the poles are likely to be affected by\nerrors in the two-moment scheme, thus limiting our ability to reliably model\nkilonovae and gamma-ray bursts. \n\n"}

Abstract: Any observer outside black holes cannot detect any physical signal produced\nby the black holes themselves, since, by definition, the black holes are not\nlocated in the causal past of the outside observer. In fact, what we regard as\nblack hole candidates in our view are not black holes but will be\ngravitationally contracting objects. As well known, a black hole will form by a\ngravitationally collapsing object in the infinite future in the views of\ndistant observers like us. At the very late stage of the gravitational\ncollapse, the gravitationally contracting object behaves as a black body due to\nits gravity. Due to this behavior, the physical signals produced around it\n(e.g. the quasi-normal ringings and the shadow image) will be very similar to\nthose caused in the eternal black hole spacetime. However those physical\nsignals do not necessarily imply the formation of a black hole in the future,\nsince we cannot rule out the possibility that the formation of the black hole\nis prevented by some unexpected event in the future yet unobserved. As such an\nexample, we propose a scenario in which the final state of the gravitationally\ncontracting spherical thin shell is a gravastar that has been proposed as a\nfinal configuration alternative to a black hole by Mazur and Mottola. This\nscenario implies that time necessary to observe the moment of the gravastar\nformation can be much longer than the lifetime of the present civilization,\nalthough such a scenario seems to be possible only if the dominant energy\ncondition is largely violated. \n\n"}

Abstract: The cold dark matter paradigm has been extremely successful for explaining a\nwide range of cosmological phenomena. Nevertheless, since evidence for\nnon-baryonic dark matter remains indirect, all reasonable alternatives should\nbe explored. One proposed idea, involving a fundamental acceleration scale a_0\n= 1-2e-10 m/s^2, is called MOdified Newtonian Dynamics or MOND. MOND was\nsuggested to explain the flat rotation curves of galaxies without the need for\ndark matter. Whether or not it can adequately fit the available data has been\ndebated for almost 20 years (and we summarise many of these studies), but only\nrecently have there been attempts to extend MOND to larger scale regimes. We\ndiscuss how the basic properties of MOND make it at best ambiguous to apply\nthese ideas to cosmological scales. We emphasize the difficulties inherent in\ndeveloping a full theory in which to embed MOND. Without such a theory there is\nno obviously consistent way to discuss the early Universe and the growth of\nperturbations. Recent claims that MONDian cosmology works very well are\ntherefore not supportable. We also provide an argument for why a_0~cH_0\nnaturally, a coincidence which is often suggested as a motivation for taking\nMOND seriously.

We discuss, in particular, how this process forces\ndark energy to behave as a pressureless component if the cosmic evolution is\ndominated by non-relativistic matter. This property is also analyzed in terms\nof the effective sound speed of the dark energy, which correspondingly\napproaches the behavior of the dominant cosmological component, being\neffectively vanishing after matter-radiation equality. To illustrate this\neffect, we consider Extended Quintessence scenarios involving a quadratic\ncoupling between the field and the Ricci scalar. We show that Quintessence\ndensity perturbations reach non-linearity at scales and redshifts relevant for\nthe structure formation process, respecting all the existing constraints on\nscalar-tensor theories of Gravity. This study opens new perspectives on the\nstandard picture of structure formation in dark energy cosmologies, since the\nQuintessence field itself, if non-minimally coupled to Gravity, may undergo\nclustering processes, eventually forming density perturbations exiting from the\nlinear regime. A non-linear approach is then required to further investigate\nthe evolution of these structures, and in particular their role in the dark\nhaloes surrounding galaxies and clusters. \n\n"}

In each\nof the three cases the particle produces a field that behaves as outgoing\nradiation in the wave zone, and therefore removes energy from the particle. In\nthe near zone the field acts on the particle and gives rise to a self-force\nthat prevents the particle from moving on a geodesic of the background\nspacetime. The field's action on the particle is difficult to calculate because\nof its singular nature: the field diverges at the position of the particle. But\nit is possible to isolate the field's singular part and show that it exerts no\nforce on the particle -- its only effect is to contribute to the particle's\ninertia. What remains after subtraction is a smooth field that is fully\nresponsible for the self-force. Because this field satisfies a homogeneous wave\nequation, it can be thought of as a free (radiative) field that interacts with\nthe particle; it is this interaction that gives rise to the self-force.

In this paper we assume that\nthe 3-brane is a de Sitter space; there is only one extra spatial dimension,\nassumed to be time dependent. By using the form of the brane-world\nenergy-momentum tensor suggested by Shiromizu et al. in the five-dimensional\nEinstein equations, it is proposed that the cosmological expansion of the\n3-brane may provide a possible explanation for the collapse of the extra\ndimension, as well as for the energy stored in the resulting curled-up\ndimension.

{"id": "quant-ph/9902015", "contents": "Title: Double Solution with Chaos: Dynamic Redundance and Causal Wave-Particle\n  Duality Abstract: A system of two interacting, physically real, initially homogeneous fields is\nconsidered as the simplest basis for the world construction in which one of\nthem, a 'protofield' of electromagnetic nature, is attracted to another\nprotofield, or medium, responsible for the eventually emerging gravitational\neffects. The interaction process is analysed within the generalised 'effective\n(optical) potential method' in which we avoid any usual perturbative reduction.\nIt then appears that for generic system parameters the protofields, instead of\nsimply 'falling' one onto another and forming a fixed 'bound state', are\nengaged in a self-sustained process of nonlinear pulsation, or 'quantum beat',\nconsisting in unceasing cycles of self-amplified auto-squeeze, or 'collapse'\n('reduction'), of a portion of the extended protofields to a small volume\nfollowed by the inverse phase of extension. Centres of consecutive reductions\nform the physical 'points' of thus emerging, intrinsically discrete space, and\neach of them is 'selected' by the system in a causally random fashion among\nmany equally possible versions (or 'realisations'). This is a manifestation of\nthe dynamic redundance forming the unified basis of dynamically complex\n(chaotic) behaviour of any real system with interaction (physics/9806002). The\nsequence of reduction events constitutes the elementary physical 'clock' of the\nworld providing it with the unceasing, intrinsically irreversible time flow.\nThe complex-dynamical quantum beat process in the system of two interacting\nprotofields is observed as the massive elementary particle (like the electron)\nwhich naturally possesses the property of physically real wave-particle duality\ncompleting the double solution concept of Louis de Broglie (see also\nquant-ph/9902016, gr-qc/9906077). \n\n"}

The major conceptual\nproblems of canonical quantum gravity are the problem of time and the problem\nof diffeomorphism invariant observables. We find that these problems are\nartifacts of the subjectivity and vagueness inherent in the framework of\northodox quantum theory. When we insist upon ontological clarity---the\ndistinguishing characteristic of a Bohmian approach---these conceptual problems\nvanish. We shall also discuss the implications of a Bohmian perspective for the\nsignificance of the wave function, concluding with unbridled speculation as to\nwhy the universe should be governed by laws so apparently bizarre as those of\nquantum mechanics. \n\n"}
