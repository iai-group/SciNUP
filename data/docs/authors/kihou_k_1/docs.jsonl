Two distinct\ntypes of systems are considered.

As the\nmagnetic field increases, the system is transformed from the uniform superfluid\nstate to the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state, and finally to the spin\npolarized normal state.

In this case, the groundstate depends on the pairing\nstrength. For weak pairing, the order parameter exhibits a periodic domain wall\nlattice pattern with a localized spin distribution at low spin imbalance, and a\nsinusoidally modulated pattern with extended spin distribution at high spin\nimbalance.

While the shape of the Fermi surface (FS) obtained with the\nlocal density approximation (LDA) can be reproduced by a two-orbital model, it\nhas been argued that the bands that cross the chemical potential result from\nthe strong hybridization of three of the Fe 3d orbitals.

Consequently, by supplementing the Hamiltonian of\nthe SU(N) model with a perturbation Hamiltonian that removes the GS degeneracy,\nthe LT is to apply also for the SU(N) model in the limit of the coupling\nconstant, \\lambda, of this perturbation approaching zero, where the limit\n\\lambda --> 0 is clearly to be taken subsequent to taking the zero-temperature\nlimit of the thermal single-particle Green function in the expression for the\nLuttinger number N_L.

In particular, the so-called\nLeggett mode for phase fluctuations is absent in the usual two-band description\nof pnictides. On the other hand, when also the repulsion between the hole bands\nis taken into account, a more general three-band description should be used,\nand a Leggett mode is then allowed.

In these lecture notes for an international school, I emphasize that even\nthough the low energy properties of a phase of matter are generally emergent\nand entirely determined by the broken symmetry, there are many differences\nbetween a strongly correlated and a weakly correlated state of matter. For\nexample, spin waves are an emergent property for antiferromagnets, but for weak\ncorrelations the normal phase of a (Slater) antiferromagnet is metallic,\nwhereas it is insulating (Heisenberg) for strong correlations. As a function of\ninteraction strength, above the antiferromagnetic phase, the crossover between\na metal and a local moment paramagnetic insulator is described by the Mott\ntransition, whose mean-field theory down to T=0 is best formulated with\ndynamical mean-field theory. A similar situation occurs for superconductors:\ndespite similar emergent properties, there are many differences between both\nkinds of superconductors. Experimental evidence suggests that hole-doped\ncuprates are strongly correlated whereas the correlations are weaker in the\nelectron-doped case, especially near optimal doping. Evidence for a pseudogap\narising from antiferromagnetic fluctuations is strong in the latter case,\nwhereas in the hole-doped case the pseudogap temperature appears as a\nconsequence of Mott physics.

The robust s-wave pairing throughout the different\nfamilies of iron-based superconductors at different doping regions signals two\nfundamental principles behind high T_c superconducting mechanisms: (1) the\ncorrespondence principle: the short range magnetic exchange interactions and\nthe Fermi surfaces act collaboratively to achieve high T_c superconductivity\nand determine pairing symmetries; (2) the magnetic selection pairing rule: the\nsuperconductivity is only induced by the magnetic exchange couplings from the\nsuperexchange mechanism through cation-anion-cation chemical bondings.

Dynamic scaling\nanalysis of the time-dependence yields a critical relaxation time of $\\tau^{*}\n= 0.064 \\pm 0.008 $ s which in turn yields an activation energy of $E_{a}^{*}$\n= 14.84 $\\pm$ 0.59 K and an ideal glass temperature $T_{0}^{*}$ = 8.91 $\\pm$\n0.09 K from Vogel-Fulcher analysis.

Standard qubit-based noise models built from Pauli\noperators do not capture leading order noise processes arising from\nquasiparticle poisoning events, thus it is not obvious {\\it a priori} that such\nnoise models can be usefully applied to a Majorana-based system. We develop\nstochastic Majorana noise models that are generalizations of the standard\nqubit-based models and connect the error probabilities defining these models to\nparameters of the physical system. Using these models, we compute\npseudo-thresholds for the $d=5$ Bacon-Shor subsystem code. Our results\nemphasize the importance of correlated errors induced in multi-qubit\nmeasurements. Moreover, we find that for sufficiently fast quasiparticle\nrelaxation the errors are well described by Pauli operators.

We argue that in 2D, the\nsystem has two typical energies - an effective spin-fermion interaction $\\bar\ng$ and an energy $\\omega_{sf}$ below which the system behaves as a Fermi\nliquid. The ratio of the two determines the dimensionless coupling constant for\nspin-fermion interaction $\\lambda^2 \\propto {\\bar g}/\\omega_{sf}$. We show that\n$\\lambda$ scales with the spin correlation length and diverges at criticality.\nThis divergence implies that the conventional perturbative expansion breaks\ndown. We developed a novel approach to the problem - the expansion in either\nthe inverse number of hot spots in the Brillouin zone, or the inverse number of\nfermionic flavors - which allowed us to explicitly account for all terms which\ndiverge as powers of $\\lambda$, and treat the remaining, $O(\\lambda)$ terms in\nthe RG formalism. We applied this technique to study the properties of the\nspin-fermion model in various frequency and temperature regimes. We present the\nresults for the fermionic spectral function, spin susceptibility, optical\nconductivity and other observables. We compare our results in detail with the\nnormal state data for cuprates, and argue that the spin-fermion model is\ncapable to explain the anomalous normal state properties of high $T_c$\nmaterials. We also discuss the non -applicability of the conventional $\\phi^4$\ntheory of the quantum-critical behavior in 2D. \n\n"}

The focus is primarily on the relationship\nbetween the quasiparticle energy eigenvalue spectrum and the geometrical shape\nof the normal-state region, i.e., the question of spectral geometry in the\nnovel setting of excitations confined by a superconducting pair-potential.\nAmong the central results of this investigation are two semiclassical trace\nformulas for the density of states. The first, a lower-resolution formula,\ncorresponds to the well-known quasiclassical approximation, conventionally\ninvoked in settings involving superconductivity.

The results provide a consistent picture and understanding on two\nphysically opposite origins of pseudogap phase.

We\nexplore two decoherence mechanisms in which these two level systems lead to the\ndecay of Rabi oscillations that result when Josephson junction qubits are\nsubjected to strong microwave driving.

The\nsemiclassical approach is constructed analogously to the Landauer transport\ntheory in mesoscopic conductors employing the idea that heat is carried by the\nquasiparticle modes propagating along the vortex core. We show that the vortex\nheat conductance in a mesoscopic sample is strongly enhanced as compared to its\nvalue for a bulk superconductor; it grows as the cylinder radius decreases.\nThis unusual behavior results from a strongly increased number of\nsingle-particle transport modes due to giant mesoscopic oscillations of energy\nlevels, which originate from the interplay between the Andreev reflection at\nthe vortex core boundary and the normal reflection at the sample edge.

The first two modes also\nexist in the ordinary s-wave superconductors, while the clapping mode with the\nenergy $\\sqrt{2} \\Delta(T)$ is unique to Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ and couples to the sound\nwave. Here we report a theoretical study of the sound propagation in a two\ndimensional p-wave superconductor. We identified the clapping mode and study\nits effects on the longitudinal and transverse sound velocities in the\nsuperconducting state. In contrast to the case of $^3$He, there is no resonance\nabsorption associated with the collective mode, since in metals $\\omega/(v_F\n|{\\bf q}|) \\ll 1$, where $v_F$ is the Fermi velocity, {\\bf q} is the wave\nvector, and $\\omega$ is the frequency of the sound wave. However, the velocity\nchange in the collisionless limit gets modified by the contribution from the\ncoupling to the clapping mode. We compute this contribution and comment on the\nvisibility of the effect. In the diffusive limit, the contribution from the\ncollective mode turns out to be negligible. The behaviors of the sound velocity\nchange and the attenuation coefficient near $T_c$ in the diffusive limit are\ncalculated and compared with the existing experimental data wherever it is\npossible. We also present the results for the attenuation coefficients in both\nof the collisionless and diffusive limits at finite temperatures. \n\n"}

Starting from weak to intermediate\ncouplings the flows are to strong coupling with different character depending\non the choice of parameters. In a large parameter region elastic Umklapp\nscatterings drive an instability which on parts of the Fermi surface exhibits\nthe key signatures of an insulating spin liquid (ISL), as proposed by Furukawa\net al., rather than a conventional symmetry-broken state. The ISL is\ncharacterized by both strong d-wave pairing and antiferromagnetic correlations,\nhowever it is insulating due to the vanishing local charge compressibility and\na spin liquid because of the spin gap arising from the pairing correlations. We\nfind that the ISL is a consequence of a Fermi surface close to the saddle\npoints at the Brillouin zone boundaries which provides an intrinsic and\nmutually reinforcing coupling between pairing and Umklapp channels. \n\n"}

In gauge theories such as QCD the interaction between\nfermions is long range and the assumptions of Kohn and Luttinger are not\nsatisfied. We show that in a U(1) gauge theory the Kohn-Luttinger phenomenon\ndoes not take place. In QCD attractive channels always exist, but there are\ncases in which the primary pairing channel leaves some fermions ungapped. As an\nexample we consider the unpaired fermion in the 2SC phase of QCD with two\nflavors. We show that it acquires a very small gap via a mechanism analogous to\nthe Kohn-Luttinger effect. The gap is too small to be phenomenologically\nrelevant. \n\n"}

The factorizing $F$-matrices (or the so-called $F$-basis) play\nan important role in the construction. In the $F$-basis, the creation (and the\nannihilation) operators and the Bethe states of the integrable models are given\nin completely symmetric forms. This leads to the determinant representations of\nthe scalar products of the Bethe states for the models. Based on the scalar\nproducts, the determinant representations of the correlation functions may be\nobtained. As an example, in this review, we give the determinant\nrepresentations of the two-point correlation function for the $\\gl$ (i.e.\nq-deformed) supersymmetric t-J model. The determinant representations are\nuseful for analysing physical properties of the integrable models in the\nthermodynamical limit. \n\n"}
