The distribution function of the\ntransported particles is decomposed into trapped and streaming particle\ncomponents. Their separate evolution equations are coupled by a source term\nthat converts trapped particles into streaming particles. We determine this\nsource term by requiring the correct diffusion limit. For a smooth transition\nto the free streaming regime, this 'diffusion source' is limited by the matter\nemissivity. The resulting streaming particle emission rates are integrated over\nspace to obtain the streaming particle flux. A geometric estimate of the flux\nfactor is used to convert the particle flux to the streaming particle density.\nThe efficiency of the scheme results from the freedom to use different\napproximations for each particle component.

To\nthis end our ab initio quantum transport program ALACANT which combines the\nnon-equilibrium Green's function formalism (NEGF) with density functional\ntheory (DFT) calculations has been extended to describe spin-polarized systems.\nWe present calculations on nanocontacts made of Ni as a prototypical magnetic\nmaterial. We find that atomic disorder in the contact region strongly reduces\nthe a priori high spin-polarization of the conductance leading to rather\nmoderate values of the so-called ballistic magnetoresistance (BMR). On the\nother hand, we show that the adsorption of oxygen in the contact region could\nstrongly enhance the spin-polarization of the conduction electrons and thus BMR\nby eliminating the spin-unpolarized s-channel. Finally, we show that short\natomic Pt chains suspended between the tips of a nanocontact are magnetic in\ncontrast to bulk Pt. However, this emergent nanoscale magnetism barely affects\nthe overall conductance of the nanocontact making it thus difficult to\ndemonstrate by simple conductance measurements.

Our\nmodel naturally predicts that the SN Ia lifetime distribution spans a range of\n0.1-20 Gyr with the double peaks at ~0.1 and 1 Gyr. While the present SN Ia\nrate in elliptical galaxies can be reproduced with the old population of the\nred-giants+WD systems, the large SN Ia rate in radio galaxies could be\nexplained with the young population of the main-sequence+WD systems. Because of\nthe metallicity effect, i.e., because of the lack of winds from WDs in the\nbinary systems, the SN Ia rate in the systems with [Fe/H]<-1, e.g., high-z\nspiral galaxies, is supposed to be very small.

In this paper I review our current\nunderstanding of these topics. I begin by considering whether AGN and BHBs show\nthe same X-ray spectral-timing `states' (e.g. low-flux, hard-spectrum or `hard'\nand high-flux, soft-spectrum or `soft'). Observational selection effects mean\nthat most of the AGN which we have monitored will probably be `soft state'\nobjects, but AGN are found in the other BHB states, although possibly with\ndifferent critical transition accretion rates. I examine timescale scaling\nrelationships between AGN and BHBs. I show that characteristic power spectral\n`bend' timescales, T_B, scale approximately with black hole mass, M_BH, but\ninversely with accretion rate, mdot_E, (in units of the Eddington accretion\nrate) probably signifying that T_B, arises at the inner edge of the accretion\ndisc. The relationship T_B proportional to M_BH/mdot_E is a good fit, implying\nthat no other potential variable, e.g. black hole spin, varies significantly.\nLags between hard and soft X-ray bands as a function of Fourier timescale\nfollow similar patterns in AGN and BHBs.

We report the detection of a moderately broad iron\n(Fe) line and of a weak soft X-ray excess. The X-ray data are very well\ndescribed by a simple model comprising a power law X-ray continuum plus its\nreflection off the accretion disc. If the inner disc radius we measure (<=3.8\ngravitational radii) is identified with the innermost stable circular orbit of\nthe black hole spacetime, we infer that the black hole powering RBS 1124 is\nrotating rapidly with spin a>= 0.6. The soft excess contribution in the 0.5-2\nkeV band is ~15%, about half than that typically observed in unobscured Seyfert\n1 galaxies and quasars, in line with the low disc reflection fraction we\nmeasure (R_disc ~0.4). The low reflection fraction cannot be driven by disc\ntruncation which is at odds not only with the small inner disc radius we infer\nbut, most importantly, with the radiatively efficient nature of the source\n(L_Bol / L_Edd ~1). A plausible explanation is that the X-ray corona is the\nbase of a failed jet (RBS 1124 being radio-quiet) and actually outflowing at\nmildly relativistic speeds. Aberration reduces the irradiation of the disc,\nthus forcing a lower than standard reflection fraction, and halves the inferred\nsource intrinsic luminosity, reducing the derived Eddington ratio from ~1to\n~0.5.

This process represents a path alternative to thermonuclear\ndisruption of accreting white dwarfs in Type Ia supernovae. Neutrino and\ngravitational-wave (GW) observations may provide crucial information necessary\nto reveal a potential AIC. Motivated by the need for systematic predictions of\nthe GW signature of AIC, we present results from an extensive set of\ngeneral-relativistic AIC simulations using a microphysical finite-temperature\nequation of state and an approximate treatment of deleptonization during\ncollapse. Investigating a set of 114 progenitor models in rotational\nequilibrium, with a wide range of rotational configurations, temperatures and\ncentral densities, we extend previous Newtonian studies and find that the GW\nsignal has a generic shape akin to what is known as a \"Type III\" signal in the\nliterature.

We highlight the differences\nand similarities between monolayer and bilayer graphene, and focus on\nthermodynamic properties such as the compressibility, the plasmon spectra, the\nweak localization correction, quantum Hall effect, and optical properties.\nConfinement of electrons in graphene is nontrivial due to Klein tunneling. We\nreview various theoretical and experimental studies of quantum confined\nstructures made from graphene. The band structure of graphene nanoribbons and\nthe role of the sublattice symmetry, edge geometry and the size of the\nnanoribbon on the electronic and magnetic properties are very active areas of\nresearch, and a detailed review of these topics is presented. Also, the effects\nof substrate interactions, adsorbed atoms, lattice defects and doping on the\nband structure of finite-sized graphene systems are discussed.

We develop the computational method based on that of\nBombelli et al to obtain the $r$ dependence of $S_C$ of scalar fields whose\nLagrangian is quadratic with respect to the scalar fields. First we study $S_C$\nin $d+1$ dimensional Minkowski spacetime.

We find that the energy supply due to nuclear burning of\ninfalling material behind the shock can energize the shock expansion especially\nfor models that produce only marginal explosions in the absence of nuclear\nburning. These models are energized by nuclear energy deposition when the shock\nfront passes through the silicon-rich layer and/or later it touches the\noxygen-rich layer. Depending on the neutrino luminosity and its decay time, a\ndiagnostic energy of explosion increases up to a few times 10^50 erg for models\nwith nuclear burning compared to the corresponding models without. We point out\nthat these features are most remarkable for the Limongi-Chieffi progenitor in\nboth 1D and 2D, because the progenitor model possesses a massive oxygen layer\nwith its inner-edge radius being smallest among the employed progenitors, so\nthat the shock can touch the rich fuel on a shorter timescale after bounce.

Accretion of matter onto an NS may increase its mass above the\nmaximum value allowed by its equation of state, inducing its collapse to a\nblack hole (BH). Here we study this process for the first time, in\nthree-dimensions, and in full general relativity. By considering three initial\nNS configurations, each with and without a surrounding disk (of mass ~7%\nM_{NS}), we investigate the effect of the accretion disk on the dynamics of the\ncollapse and its imprint on both the gravitational wave (GW) and\nelectromagnetic (EM) signals that can be emitted by these sources. We show in\nparticular that, even if the GW signal is similar for the accretion induced\ncollapse (AIC) and the collapse of an NS in vacuum (and detectable only for\nGalactic sources), the EM counterpart could allow us to discriminate between\nthese two types of events. In fact, our simulations show that, while the\ncollapse of an NS in vacuum leaves no appreciable baryonic matter outside the\nevent horizon, an AIC is followed by a phase of rapid accretion of the\nsurviving disk onto the newly formed BH.

Historically, galaxy formation models\nhave had difficulty explaining the observed number counts of SMGs. We combine a\nsemi-empirical model with 3-D hydrodynamical simulations and 3-D dust radiative\ntransfer to predict the number counts of unlensed SMGs. Because the stellar\nmass functions, gas and dust masses, and sizes of our galaxies are constrained\nto match observations, we can isolate uncertainties related to the dynamical\nevolution of galaxy mergers and the dust radiative transfer. The number counts\nand redshift distributions predicted by our model agree well with observations.\nIsolated disc galaxies dominate the faint (S_1.1 < ~1 mJy, or S_850 < ~2 mJy)\npopulation. The brighter sources are a mix of merger-induced starbursts and\ngalaxy-pair SMGs; the latter subpopulation accounts for ~30 - 50 per cent of\nall SMGs at all S_1.1 > ~0.5 mJy (S_850 > ~1 mJy). The mean redshifts are ~3.0\n- 3.5, depending on the flux cut, and the brightest sources tend to be at\nhigher redshifts. Because the galaxy-pair SMGs will be resolved into multiple\nfainter sources by ALMA, the bright ALMA counts should be as much as 2 times\nless than those observed using single-dish telescopes. The agreement between\nour model, which uses a Kroupa IMF, and observations suggests that the IMF in\nhigh-redshifts starbursts need not be top-heavy; if the IMF were top-heavy, our\nmodel would over-predict the number counts. We conclude that the difficulty\nsome models have reproducing the observed SMG counts is likely indicative of\nmore general problems -- such as an under-prediction of the abundance of\nmassive galaxies or a star formation rate--stellar mass relation normalisation\nlower than that observed -- rather than a problem specific to the SMG\npopulation. \n\n"}

But if disks are\nturbulent, this neglects a spectrum of stochastic density fluctuations that can\nproduce rare, high-density mass concentrations. Here, we use a\nrecently-developed analytic framework to predict the statistics of these\nfluctuations, i.e. the rate of fragmentation and mass spectrum of fragments\nformed in a turbulent Keplerian disk. Turbulent disks are never completely\nstable: we calculate the (always finite) probability of forming\nself-gravitating structures via stochastic turbulent density fluctuations in\nsuch disks. Modest sub-sonic turbulence above Mach number ~0.1 can produce a\nfew stochastic fragmentation or 'direct collapse' events over ~Myr timescales,\neven if Q>>1 and cooling is slow (t_cool>>t_orbit).

Using rapid follow-up INTEGRAL and XMM-Newton observations,\nwe show the first pulsar (designated SXP175) to be coincident with a candidate\nhigh-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) in the northern bar region of the SMC undergoing\na small Type II outburst. The orbital period (87d) and spectral class\n(B0-B0.5IIIe) of this system are determined and presented here for the first\ntime. The second pulsar is shown not to be new at all, but is consistent with\nbeing SXP91.1 - a pulsar discovered at the very beginning of the 13 year long\nRXTE key monitoring programme of the SMC. Whilst it is theoretically possible\nfor accreting neutron stars to change spin period so dramatically over such a\nshort time, the X-ray and optical data available for this source suggest this\nspin-up is continuous during long phases of X-ray quiescence, where accretion\ndriven spin-up of the neutron star should be minimal. \n\n"}

Recently, substantial progress was achieved in enhancing the\ntime within which a solid-state qubit demonstrates coherent dynamics. This\nprogress is based mostly on a successful isolation of the qubits from external\ndecoherence sources obtained by clever engineering. Under these conditions, the\nmaterial-inherent sources of noise start to play a crucial role. In most cases,\nquantum devices are affected by noise decreasing with frequency, f,\napproximately as 1/f. According to the present point of view, such noise is due\nto material- and device-specific microscopic degrees of freedom interacting\nwith quantum variables of the nanodevice. The simplest picture is that the\nenvironment that destroys the phase coherence of the device can be thought of\nas a system of two-state fluctuators, which experience random hops between\ntheir states. If the hopping times are distributed in a exponentially broad\ndomain, the resulting fluctuations have a spectrum close to 1/f in a large\nfrequency range. In this paper we review the current state of the theory of\ndecoherence due to degrees of freedom producing 1/f noise. We discuss basic\nmechanisms of such noises in various nanodevices and then review several models\ndescribing the interaction of the noise sources with quantum devices. The main\nfocus of the review is to analyze how the 1/f noise destroys their coherent\noperation. We start from individual qubits concentrating mostly on the devices\nbased on superconductor circuits, and then discuss some special issues related\nto more complicated architectures.

The results are\nthen compared to the existing progenitor models of Ibc SNe, where it is\nconcluded that it is highly likely that at least two progenitor channels exist\nfor producing a Ibc SN: most Ibc SNe arise via binary interactions, where the\nmass of the stellar progenitor is less than what is attributed to a Wolf Rayet\nstar. Conversely, the progenitors of Ic-BL and GRB/XRF are more massive than\nthose of Ib and Ic SNe, though a key difference between them is progenitor\nmetallicity, with Ic-BL SNe arise from more metal rich progenitors. As mass\nloss in massive stars is influenced by metal content, the progenitors of Ic-BL\nSNe lose more mass, and therefore more angular momentum, before exploding. It\nis expected that the explosion mechanism in Ic-BL and GRB/XRF SNe is\n``engine-driven'' (i.e. an accreting black hole, or a millisecond magnetar),\nbut the increased mass loss of Ic-BL SNe means the central engine is less\npowerful than in GRB/XRF SNe.

Favorable conditions for merger are initiated by the Kozai\nresonance in which the gravitational interaction with a third distant object,\ntypically another BH, induces quasi-periodic variations of the inner BH binary\neccentricity. In this paper we perform high precision N-body simulations of the\nlong term evolution of hierarchical BH triples and investigate the conditions\nthat lead to the merging of the BH binary and the way it might become an\nobservable source of GW radiation. We find that the secular orbit average\ntreatment, adopted in previous works, does not reliably describe the dynamics\nof these systems if the binary is orbited by the outer BH on a highly inclined\norbit at a moderate distance. During the high eccentricity phase of a Kozai\ncycle the torque due to the outer BH can drive the binary to extremely large\neccentricities in a fraction of the binary's orbital period. This occurs before\nrelativistic terms become important to the evolution and allows the binary GW\nsignal to reach large GW frequencies (>~10 Hz) at high eccentricities. We show\nthat ~50 % of coalescing BH binaries driven by the Kozai mechanism in GCs will\nhave eccentricities larger than 0.1, with 10 % of them being extremely\neccentric, (1-e)<~10^-5, when they first chirp in the frequency band of ground\nbased laser interferometers. This implies that a large fraction of such GW\nsources could be missed if conventional quasi-circular templates are used for\nanalysis of GW detectors data.

While numerical calculations may reflect\nsuch features, a complete theory of band warping has not been developed. We\ndevelop a generally applicable theory, based on radial expansions, and a\ncorresponding definition of angular effective mass.

Unlike chameleon and symmetron screening, which come into effect in\nregions of high density, Vainshtein screening instead depends on the\ndimensionality of the system, and screened bodies can still feel external\nfields. ORIGAMI is well-suited to this problem because it defines morphologies\naccording to the dimensionality of the collapsing structure and does not depend\non a smoothing scale or density threshold parameter. We find that halo\nparticles are screened while filament, wall, and void particles are unscreened,\nand this is independent of the particle density. However, after separating\nhalos according to their large scale morphological environment, we find no\ndifference in the screening properties of halos in filaments versus halos in\nclusters. We find that the fifth force enhancement of dark matter particles in\nhalos is greatest well outside the virial radius.

It leads to\nspontaneously fluctuating Cu - O - Cu valence bonds which establish a local\nFeshbach resonance exchange coupling between bound and unbound electron pairs.\nThe coupling, being the only free parameter in this scenario, the hole doping\nof the parent state is monitored by varying the total number of unpaired and\npaired electrons, in chemical equilibrium with each other. Upon lowering the\ntemperature to below a certain $T^*$, bound and unbound electron pairs lock\ntogether in a local quantum superposition, generating transient localized bound\nelectron pairs and a concomitant opening of a pseudo-gap in the single-particle\ndensity of states. At low temperature, this pseudo-gap state transits via a\nfirst order hole doping induced phase transition into a superconducting state\nin which the localized transient bound electron pairs get spatially phase\ncorrelated. The mechanism driving that transition is a phase separation between\ntwo phases having different relative densities of bound and unbound electron\npairs, which is reminiscent of the physics of $^4$He - $^3$He mixtures. \n\n"}

As a framework for analysing our results, we introduce\nsemi-empirical scaling laws relating neutrino heating, average turbulent\nvelocities in the gain region, and the shock deformation in the saturation\nlimit of non-radial instabilities. The squared turbulent Mach number, <Ma^2>,\nreflects the violence of aspherical motions in the gain layer, and explosive\nrunaway occurs for <Ma^2>~0.3, corresponding to a reduction of the critical\nneutrino luminosity by ~25% compared to 1D.

Our detection simulation studies show that for a nearby supernova\n(0.2 kpc) we can confirm the lack of core rotation close to 100% of the time,\nand the presence of core rotation about 90% of the time.

The coupling is due to screening of Coulomb\ninteraction in the granular film by the FE layer.

The characteristic excess in the\nspectrograms originates not only from rotating core-collapse, bounce and the\nsubsequent ring down of the proto-neutron star (PNS) as previously identified,\nbut also from the formation of magnetohydrodynamics jets and non-axisymmetric\ninstabilities in the vicinity of the PNS.

Computational models have become\nincreasingly sophisticated, first in one spatial dimension assuming spherical\nsymmetry, then in two spatial dimensions assuming axisymmetry, and now in three\nspatial dimensions with no imposed symmetries. The increase in the number of\nspatial dimensions has been accompanied by an increase in the physics included\nin the models, and an increase in the sophistication with which this physics\nhas been modeled. Computation has played an essential role in the development\nof CCSN theory, not simply for the obvious reason that such multidimensional,\nmulti-physics, nonlinear events cannot possibly be fully captured analytically,\nbut for its role in discovery. In particular, the discovery of the standing\naccretion shock instability (SASI) through computation about a decade ago has\nimpacted all simulations performed since then.

Recent 3D simulations suggest that\nturbulence might play a crucial role in core-collapse supernova explosions,\nhowever the fidelity with which turbulence is simulated in these studies is\nunclear. Especially considering that the accuracy of ILES for the regime of\ninterest in CCSN, weakly compressible and strongly anisotropic, has not been\nsystematically assessed before. In this paper we assess the accuracy of ILES\nusing numerical methods most commonly employed in computational astrophysics by\nmeans of a number of local simulations of driven, weakly compressible,\nanisotropic turbulence. We report a detailed analysis of the way in which the\nturbulent cascade is influenced by the numerics. Our results suggest that\nanisotropy and compressibility in CCSN turbulence have little effect on the\nturbulent kinetic energy spectrum and a Kolmogorov $k^{-5/3}$ scaling is\nobtained in the inertial range. We find that, on the one hand, the kinetic\nenergy dissipation rate at large scales is correctly captured even at\nrelatively low resolutions, suggesting that very high effective Reynolds number\ncan be achieved at the largest scales of the simulation.

Compared to the iron pnictides,\nthese systems have only electron Fermi pockets (i.e. no hole Fermi pockets) but\ncomparable superconducting transition temperatures. The challenge lies in\nreconciling the two basic experimental features of their superconducting state:\na node-less gap and the existence of a resonance in the spin excitation\nspectrum. We propose a mechanism based on reconstructing two quasi-degenerate\npairing states, one in an $s$-wave $A_{1g}$ channel that is fully gapped, and\nthe other in a $d$-wave $B_{1g}$ channel whose pairing function changes sign\nacross the electron Fermi pockets at the Brillouin-zone boundary. The resulting\nintermediate pairing state, which we call an orbital-selective $s \\times\n\\tau_3$ state, incorporates both of the above two properties. When the leading\nspin-singlet pairing is in the $d_{xz}, d_{yz}$ orbital subspace, this state\nretains the $s$-wave form factor but has a $B_{1g}$ symmetry due to an internal\n$\\tau_3$ structure in the orbital space.

The robust s-wave pairing throughout the different\nfamilies of iron-based superconductors at different doping regions signals two\nfundamental principles behind high T_c superconducting mechanisms: (1) the\ncorrespondence principle: the short range magnetic exchange interactions and\nthe Fermi surfaces act collaboratively to achieve high T_c superconductivity\nand determine pairing symmetries; (2) the magnetic selection pairing rule: the\nsuperconductivity is only induced by the magnetic exchange couplings from the\nsuperexchange mechanism through cation-anion-cation chemical bondings. These\nprinciples explain why the unconventional high T_c superconductivity appears to\nbe such a rare but robust phenomena with its strict requirement on electronic\nenvironment.

The FRET rate is controlled by the mirror up to distances\ncomparable to the donor-acceptor distance, that is, the few-nanometer range.\nFor vanishing distance, we find a complete inhibition or a four-fold\nenhancement, depending on dipole orientation. For mirror distances on the\nwavelength scale, where the well-known `Drexhage' modification of the\nspontaneous-emission rate occurs, the FRET rate is constant. Hence there is no\ncorrelation between the Foerster (or total) energy transfer rate and the LDOS.\nAt any distance to the mirror, the total energy transfer between a\nclosely-spaced donor and acceptor is dominated by Foerster transfer, i.e., by\nthe static dipole-dipole interaction that yields the characteristic\ninverse-sixth-power donor-acceptor distance dependence in homogeneous media.\nGeneralizing to arbitrary inhomogeneous media with weak dispersion and weak\nabsorption in the frequency overlap range of donor and acceptor, we derive two\nmain theoretical results. Firstly, the spatially dependent Foerster energy\ntransfer rate does not depend on frequency, hence not on the LDOS.

We have used a large ensemble of semi-numerical simulations and\nan analytical model to estimate the effect of this non-Gaussianity on the\nentire error-covariance matrix ${\\mathcal{C}}_{ij}$.

The other is the\ntrispectrum of the signal. Using the simulated 21-cm signal ensemble, an\nensemble of the randomized signal and ensembles of Gaussian random ensembles we\nhave quantified the effect of the trispectrum on the error variance\n${\\mathcal{C}}_{ij}$.

Dynamical capture mergers may take place in globular clusters, as\nwell as other dense stellar systems, where most neutron stars have large spins.\nWe find significant variability in the merger outcome as a function of initial\nneutron star spin. For cases where the spin is aligned with the orbital angular\nmomentum, the additional centrifugal support in the remnant hypermassive\nneutron star can prevent the prompt collapse to a black hole, while for\nantialigned cases the decreased total angular momentum can facilitate the\ncollapse to a black hole. We show that even moderate spins can significantly\nincrease the amount of ejected material, including the amount unbound with\nvelocities greater than half the speed of light, leading to brighter\nelectromagnetic signatures associated with kilonovae and interaction of the\nejecta with the interstellar medium.

All models develop explosions, but depending on the progenitor\nstructure, they can be divided into two classes. With a steep density decline\nat the Si/Si-O interface, the arrival of this interface at the shock front\nleads to a sudden drop of the mass-accretion rate, triggering a rapid approach\nto explosion. With a more gradually decreasing accretion rate, it takes longer\nfor the neutrino heating to overcome the accretion ram pressure and explosions\nset in later. Early explosions are facilitated by high mass-accretion rates\nafter bounce and correspondingly high neutrino luminosities combined with a\npronounced drop of the accretion rate and ram pressure at the Si/Si-O\ninterface.

This type of manipulation of the system\nresponse could be helpful for its full characterization, since it would allow\nus to visualize transitions that are dark when using unshaped pulses. In order\nto investigate these possibilities, we perform first a theoretical analysis of\nthe non-equilibrium response function in this context, aided by one simple\nnumerical model of the Hydrogen atom.

Much of this may be caused\nby the requirement that the gravitational sphere of influence of the black hole\nmust be resolved for the black-hole mass to be reliably estimated. We revisit\nthis issue by using a comprehensive galaxy evolution semi-analytic model, which\nself-consistently evolves supermassive black holes from high-redshift seeds via\ngas accretion and mergers, and also includes AGN feedback. Once tuned to\nreproduce the (mean) correlation of black-hole mass with velocity dispersion,\nthe model is unable to also account for the correlation with stellar mass. This\nbehaviour is independent of the model's parameters, thus suggesting an internal\ninconsistency in the data. The predicted distributions, especially at the\nlow-mass end, are also much broader than observed. However, if selection\neffects are included, the model's predictions tend to align with the\nobservations. We also demonstrate that the correlations between the residuals\nof the local scaling relations are more effective than the scaling relations\nthemselves at constraining AGN feedback models. In fact, we find that our\nsemi-analytic model, while in apparent broad agreement with the scaling\nrelations when accounting for selection biases, yields very weak correlations\nbetween their residuals at fixed stellar mass, in stark contrast with\nobservations. This problem persists when changing the AGN feedback strength,\nand is also present in the $z\\sim 0$ outputs of the hydrodynamic cosmological\nsimulation Horizon-AGN, which includes state-of-the-art treatments of AGN\nfeedback.

Because the Alfv\\'en speed\nvaries with distance from the disk, the AWs undergo partial non-WKB reflection,\nand counter-propagating AWs subsequently interact, causing AW energy to cascade\nto small scales and dissipate. To investigate this process, we introduce an\nElsasser-like formulation of general relativistic MHD (GRMHD) and develop the\ntheory of general relativistic reduced MHD in an inhomogeneous medium. We then\nderive a set of equations for the mean-square AW amplitude $M_+$ and turbulent\nheating rate $Q$ under the assumption that, in the plasma rest frame, AWs\npropagating away from the disk are much more energetic than AWs propagating\ntoward the disk. For the case in which the background flow is axisymmetric and\ntime-independent, we solve these equations analytically to determine $M_+$ and\n$Q$ as functions of position.

Using Principal Component\nAnalysis we identify the key axes of correlation between these physical\nquantities, for the full galaxy sample and split by satellite/central and\nlow/high halo mass. The first principal component of the z=0 EAGLE galaxy\npopulation is a positive correlation between M_halo, M* and SFR. This component\nis particularly dominant for central galaxies in low mass haloes. The second\nprincipal component, most significant in high mass haloes, is a negative\ncorrelation between M_halo and SFR, indicative of environmental quenching. For\ngalaxies above M*~10^10M_solar, however, the SFR is seen to decouple from the\nM_halo-M* correlation; this result is found to be independent of environment,\nsuggesting that mass quenching effects are also in operation.

For the most common type of progenitors, likely with slowly rotating\ncores, the dominant GW emission mechanisms are the post-bounce oscillations of\nthe proto-neutron star (PNS) before the explosion. We present a new procedure\nto compute the eigenmodes of the system formed by the PNS and the stalled\naccretion shock in general relativity including spacetime perturbations. The\nnew method improves on previous results by accounting for perturbations of both\nthe lapse function and the conformal factor. We apply our analysis to two\nnumerical core-collapse simulations and show that our improved method is able\nto obtain eigenfrequencies that accurately match the features observed in the\nGW signal and to predict the qualitative behaviour of quasi-radial\noscillations. Our analysis is possible thanks to a newly developed algorithm to\nclassify the computed eigenmodes in different classes (f-, p-, and g-modes),\nimproving previous results which suffered from misclassification issues. We\nfind that most of the GW energy is stored in the lowest order eigenmodes, in\nparticular in the $^2g_1$ mode and in the $^2f$ mode.

We find that a\ntightFIR/Radio correlation is natural when the synchrotron mechanism dominates\nover the inverse Compton, and the electrons cooling time is shorter than the\nfading time of the supernova rate. Observations indicate that both these\nconditions are met in star forming galaxies. However since the radio non\nthermal emission is delayed, deviations are expected both in the early phases\nof a starburst, when the radio thermal component dominates, and in the\npost-starburst phase, when the bulk of the NT component originates from less\nmassive stars. This delay allows the analysis of obscured starbursts with a\ntime resolution of a few tens of Myrs, unreachable with other star formation\nindicators.

The\nFornax clusters have exceptionally large RR Lyrae specific frequencies compared\nwith the Galactic globular clusters. Furthermore, the Fornax cluster RR Lyrae\nstars are unusual in that their characteristics are intermediate between the\ntwo Galactic Oosterhoff groups. In this respect the Fornax clusters are similar\nto the field populations in several dwarf galaxies. We revise previous\nmeasurements of the HB morphology in each cluster. The Fornax clusters closely\nresemble the ``young'' Galactic halo population defined by Zinn. The existence\nof the second parameter effect among the Fornax clusters is also confirmed.\nFinally, we determine foreground reddening and distance estimates for each\ncluster.

Abstract: There is mounting evidence that long duration gamma ray bursts (GRBs) are\nproduced by ultra-relativistic jets of ordinary matter which are ejected in\ncore collapse supernova (SN) explosions. Such jets are extremely efficient\ncosmic ray (CR) accelerators which can accelerate the swept up ambient\nparticles on their way to the highest observed CR energies. The bulk of the jet\nkinetic energy is used to accelerate CRs while only a tiny fraction is used to\nproduce the GRB and its afterglow. Here we use the remarkably successful\ncannonball (CB) model of GRBs to show that the bipolar jets from SN explosions,\nwhich produce GRBs most of which are not beamed towards Earth, can be the main\norigin of cosmic rays at all energies. The model explains very simply the\nelemental composition of CRs and their observed spectra at all energies. In\nparticular it explains the origin of the CR knees and ankle. Above the CR\nankle, the Galactic magnetic fields can no longer delay the free escape of\nultra-high energies CRs (UHECR) from the Galaxy, and the CRs from the\nintergalactic medium (IGM), which were injected there by SN jets from all the\ngalaxies and isotropized there by the IGM magnetic fields, dominate the\nGalactic CR spectrum. A Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) effect due to the\ninteraction of UHECRs with the microwave background radiation is expected. The\nCR nuclei which diffuse out of galaxies, or are directly deposited in the IGM\nby the relativistic SN jets, may be the origin of the IGM magnetic fields.\nInverse Compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background radiation (MBR)\nby the CR electrons in the IGM produces the diffuse extragalactic gamma-ray\nbackground radiation (GBR). \n\n"}

The cluster initial mass function\ntypically appears to be consistent with a power-law with a slope of about -2,\nbut most attempts to constrain any upper limit on the CIMF have been limited by\nsize-of-sample effects. However, evidence is starting to accumulate for\npossible truncation of the cluster mass function.

The\nobserved X-ray properties in phases 1 and 3 are remarkably similar, suggesting\nthat the same physical processes are likely involved in triggering such\ntransitions. The power density spectrum (PDS) during the transition can be\ncharacterized by a red noise component, followed by a white noise component\nwhich extends to roughly 1-3 Hz where it is cut off, and a steeper power law at\nhigher frequencies. The X-ray flux also exhibits apparent quasi-periodic\noscillation (QPO) with the centroid frequency varying in the range of 4-12 Hz.\nThe QPO shows no correlation with the source flux, but becomes more prominent\nat higher energies. This type of PDS bears resemblance to that of other black\nhole candidates often observed in a so-called very high state, although the\norigin of the observed QPO may be very different. The low-frequency red noise\nhas not been observed in the hard state, thus seems to be positively correlated\nwith the disk mass accretion rate which is presumably low in the hard state and\nhigh in the soft state; in fact, it completely dominates the PDS in the soft\nstate.

Here we review the\nfailures of the commonly-used velocity dispersion models and present an\nempirical method for extracting beta from the quadrupole statistic that has\nlittle systematic offset over a wide range of beta and cosmologies. This\nempirical model is then applied to an ensemble of mock 2dF southern strip\nsurveys, to illustrate the technique and see how accurately we can recover the\ntrue value of beta. We compare this treatment with the error we expect to find\ndue only to the finite volume of the survey. We find that non-linear effects\nreduce the range of scales over which beta can be fitted, and introduce\ncovariances between nearby modes in addition to those introduced by the\nconvolution with the survey window function.

Because gravitational waves have only two polarizations,\nany network of three or more differently oriented interferometers with similar\nobserving bands is redundant. For LISA, this ``null'' output is known as the\nSagnac mode, and its use in discriminating between detector noise and a\ncosmological gravitational wave background is well understood [1][2]. But the\nusefulness of the null veto for ground-based detector networks has been ignored\nuntil now. We show that it should make it possible to discriminate in a\nmodel-independent way between real gravitational waves and accidentally\ncoincident non-Gaussian noise ``events'' in redundant networks of two or more\nbroadband detectors (e.g, three LIGO detectors and GEO). It has been shown that\nwith three detectors, the null output can be used to locate the direction to\nthe source, and then two other linear combinations of detector outputs give the\noptimal ``coherent'' reconstruction of the two polarization components of the\nsignal.

As standard star products are not correct for such manifolds, the\nstandard non-commutative CS theory is not also appropriate here. Instead we\nformulate a new finite-dimensional matrix CS model as an approximation to the\nCS theory on the strip. A work which has points of contact with ours is due to\nLizzi, Vitale and Zampini where the authors obtain a description for the fuzzy\ndisc.

This oscillator is\nassociated with the underlying Moyal plane. The resultant matrix CS theory has\na fuzzy edge.
