The decays can be classified according to the\ntype of the anomaly (triangle or box) that governs the corresponding amplitude\nwhen it is extrapolated to the chiral point. In order to take the momentum\ndependencies of the form factors into account, the actual calculations are\nperformed in the frame work of vector meson dominance (VMD) models, namely in\nterms of the original hidden gauge model and modern generalized models. The\nresults of the triangle-anomaly sector show that the hidden gauge model and the\nmodern modifications can describe the data equally well.

In particular, the polarization transfer results have exposed the\nlimits of applicability of the one-photon-exchange approximation and\nhighlighted the role of quark orbital angular momentum in the nucleon\nstructure. The GEp-II experiment in Jefferson Lab's Hall A measured $R$ at four\n$Q^2$ values in the range 3.5 GeV$^2 \\le Q^2 \\le 5.6$ GeV$^2$.

Boundary-value\n  techniques Abstract: We propose a new concept for determining the interior magnetic field vector\ncomponents in neutron electric dipole moment experiments. If a closed\nthree-dimensional boundary surface surrounding the fiducial volume of an\nexperiment can be defined such that its interior encloses no currents or\nsources of magnetization, each of the interior vector field components and the\nmagnetic scalar potential will satisfy a Laplace equation. Therefore, if either\nthe vector field components or the normal derivative of the scalar potential\ncan be measured on the surface of this boundary, thus defining a Dirichlet or\nNeumann boundary-value problem, respectively, the interior vector field\ncomponents or the scalar potential (and, thus, the field components via the\ngradient of the potential) can be uniquely determined via solution of the\nLaplace equation.

Purpose: We\npropose a new hybrid ''relativistic-mean-field-plus-pairing'' approach in which\npairing is treated exactly so the number of particles is conserved. To verify\nthe reliability of the formalism, we apply it to the study of both ground-state\nproperties and isoscalar monopole excitations of the Tin isotopes. Methods:\nAccurately-calibrated relativistic mean-field models supplemented by an exact\ntreatment of pairing correlations are used to compute ground-state observables\nalong the isotopic chain in Tin.

These degeneracies cannot be broken by the CMB constraint on the\neffective number of neutrinos, N_eff. However, big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN)\nis affected by a light WIMP and equivalent neutrinos, so the combination of BBN\nand CMB can break some of the degeneracies. Here, BBN predictions for\nabundances in the presence of a light WIMP and equivalent neutrinos are\nexplored, and estimates of their observationally determined relic abundances\nare used to limit m_chi, Delta N_nu, and the present Universe baryon density\n(Omega_B h^2). These constraints are explored for Majorana and Dirac fermion\nWIMPs, as well as for real and complex scalar WIMPs that couple to electrons,\npositrons, and photons. In a separate paper this analysis is repeated for WIMPs\nthat couple only to the standard model neutrinos, and constraints for the two\ncases are contrasted. Without a light WIMP but allowing for equivalent\nneutrinos, the combined BBN and CMB constraints favor N_eff = 3.46 +/- 0.17,\nOmega_B h^2 = 0.0224 +/- 0.0003, and Delta N_nu = 0.40 +/- 0.17.

The data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of approximately\n35 inverse nanobarns, were collected at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy\n(sqrt(s[NN])) of 5.02 TeV with the CMS detector at the LHC. The results are\ncompared to semi-peripheral PbPb collision data at sqrt(s[NN]) = 2.76 TeV,\ncovering similar charged-particle multiplicities in the events.

These quantities are studied as a function of the\ncharged-particle multiplicity in the event and the transverse momentum of the\nparticles.

The collectivity depends on the details of\nthe shell structure around the Fermi levels, in particular the presence of the\norbitals that have the enhanced transition matrix elements of the non-axial\nquadrupole excitation. Quite recently, a sudden decrease in the excitation\nenergy of the $\\gamma$ vibration was observed at RIKEN RIBF for the\nneutron-rich Dy isotopes at $N=106$.

Methods: The low-frequency modes of excitation in the\nneutron-rich rare-earth nuclei are described based on nuclear\ndensity-functional theory. We employ the Skyrme energy-density functionals\n(EDF) in the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calculation for the ground states and in\nthe Quasiparticle Random-Phase Approximation (QRPA) for the excitations.\nResults: The lowering of the excitation energy around $N=106$ is reproduced\nwell by employing the SkM* and SLy4 functionals.

Recent\nterrestrial experiments constrain both its value and slope at nuclear\nsaturation density, however, its value at higher densities is unknown. Assuming\na Free Fermi-gas (FFG) model for the kinetic symmetry energy, the high-density\nextrapolation depends on a single parameter, the density dependence of the\npotential symmetry energy. The Correlated Fermi-gas (CFG) model improves on the\nFFG model by including the effects of short-range, correlated, high-momentum,\nnucleons in nuclear matter. Using the CFG model for the kinetic symmetry energy\nalong with constraints from terrestrial measurements leads to a much softer\ndensity dependence for the potential symmetry energy. Purpose: Examine the\nability of the FFG and CFG models to describe NS observables that are directly\nsensitive to the symmetry energy at high-density. Specifically, examine the\nability of the CFG model, with its softer density dependence of the potential\nsymmetry energy, to describe a two solar-mass NS. Methods: Using a Bayesian\nanalysis of NS observables we compare the CFG and FFG models and examine the\nresulting parameters in the NS EOS and the density dependence of the potential\nsymmetry energy. Results: Despite the large difference in the density\ndependence of the potential part of the symmetry energy, both models can\ndescribe the NS data and support a two solar-mass NS. The different density\ndependences has only a small effect on the NS EOS. Conclusions: While sensitive\nto the high-density values of the symmetry energy, NS observables alone are not\nenough to distinguish between the CFG and FFG models. This indicates that the\nNS EOS, obtain from Bayesian analysis of NS observables, is robust and is not\nsensitive to the exact nuclear model used for the kinetic symmetry energy. \n\n"}

The analysis uses data from sqrt(s[NN]) = 2.76 TeV PbPb and\nsqrt(s[NN]) = 5.02 TeV pPb collisions collected by the CMS experiment at the\nLHC. Two-particle azimuthal correlations have been extensively used to study\nhydrodynamic flow in heavy ion collisions. Recently it has been shown that the\nexpected factorization of two-particle results into a product of the\nconstituent single-particle anisotropies is broken. The new information\nprovided by these modes may shed light on the breakdown of flow factorization\nin heavy ion collisions. The first two modes (\"leading\" and \"subleading\") of\ntwo-particle correlations are presented for elliptical and triangular\nanisotropies in PbPb and pPb collisions as a function of pt over a wide range\nof event activity.

We find that the initial Glauber type\nnucleon-nucleon collisions generate negative $v_1$ for nucleons at midrapidity\ndue to the presence of spectator matter, and this negative nucleon $v_1$ is\nturned to be positive by the meson-baryon interactions at the beam energy\nregion of $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} < 30$ GeV.

Each part undergoes the renormalization due to the\ninteractions among quarks and gluons, although the total tensor $T^{\\mu\\nu}$ is\nnot renormalized thanks to the conservation of energy and momentum. Recently it\nhas been shown that, through the renormalization, each of the quark and gluon\nparts of $T^{\\mu\\nu}$ receives a definite amount of anomalous trace\ncontribution, such that their sum reproduces the well-known QCD trace anomaly,\n$T^\\mu_\\mu= (\\beta/2g)F^{\\mu\\nu}F_{\\mu\\nu}+ m (1+\\gamma_m)\\bar{\\psi}\\psi$, and\nthe corresponding formulas have been derived up to two-loop order.

The highest transverse momentum particle in each event is used as\nthe trigger particle and the region $3 < p_{\\rm{Tt}} < 15$ GeV/$c$ is explored\nin this study. The measured distributions show a clear narrow Gaussian\ncomponent and a wide non-Gaussian one. Based on Pythia simulations, the narrow\ncomponent can be related to non-perturbative hadronization and the wide\ncomponent to quantum chromodynamical splitting. The width of the narrow\ncomponent shows a weak dependence on the transverse momentum of the trigger\nparticle, in agreement with the expectation of universality of the\nhadronization process. On the other hand, the width of the wide component shows\na rising trend suggesting increased branching for higher transverse momentum.\nThe results obtained in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV and in p-Pb\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm{NN}}}$ = 5.02 TeV are compatible within\nuncertainties and hence no significant cold nuclear matter effects are\nobserved.

{"id": "astro-ph/9811350", "contents": "Title: Can a supernova be located by its neutrinos? Abstract: A future core-collapse supernova in our Galaxy will be detected by several\nneutrino detectors around the world. The neutrinos escape from the supernova\ncore over several seconds from the time of collapse, unlike the electromagnetic\nradiation, emitted from the envelope, which is delayed by a time of order\nhours. In addition, the electromagnetic radiation can be obscured by dust in\nthe intervening interstellar space. The question therefore arises whether a\nsupernova can be located by its neutrinos alone. The early warning of a\nsupernova and its location might allow greatly improved astronomical\nobservations. The theme of the present work is a careful and realistic\nassessment of this question, taking into account the statistical significance\nof the various neutrino signals. Not surprisingly, neutrino-electron forward\nscattering leads to a good determination of the supernova direction, even in\nthe presence of the large and nearly isotropic background from other reactions.\nEven with the most pessimistic background assumptions, SuperKamiokande (SK) and\nthe Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) can restrict the supernova direction to\nbe within circles of radius $5^\\circ$ and $20^\\circ$, respectively. Other\nreactions with more events but weaker angular dependence are much less useful\nfor locating the supernova. Finally, there is the oft-discussed possibility of\ntriangulation, i.e., determination of the supernova direction based on an\narrival time delay between different detectors. Given the expected statistics\nwe show that, contrary to previous estimates, this technique does not allow a\ngood determination of the supernova direction. \n\n"}

Many different phenomena can lead both to\nthe creation and to the suppression of a fluctuation peak. In particular, the\nrole of constraints due to conservation laws and to data sorting is shown to be\nessential. From the experimental point of view, a comparison of the available\nfragmentation data reveals that there is a good agreement between different\ndata sets of basic fluctuation observables, if the fragmenting source is of\ncomparable size. This compatibility suggests that the fragmentation process is\nlargely independent of the reaction mechanism (central versus peripheral\ncollisions, symmetric versus asymmetric systems, light ions versus heavy ion\ninduced reactions).

This is achieved over a volume V of the order\nof the strangeness correlation length and is assumed to be smaller than the\nfreeze-out volume. Probability distributions of strange hadrons emanating from\nthe system are computed for varying sizes of V and simple experimental\nobservables based on these are proposed.

In this work, we discuss the extension\nof this program to hard photodisintegration of a $pp$ pair in the $^3$He\nnucleus. Experimental confirmation of new features predicted here for the\nsuggested reaction would advance our understanding of hard nuclear reactions. A\nmain prediction, in contrast with low-energy observations, is that the $pp$\nbreakup cross section is not much smaller than the one for $pn$ break up.In\nsome models, the energy-dependent oscillations observed for $pp$ scattering are\npredicted to appear in the $\\gamma ^3{\\rm He} \\to p p + n$ reaction.

For the elementary neutrino-nucleon interaction,\nwe take into account quasielastic scattering, Delta excitation and the\nexcitation of the resonances in the second resonance region. Our model for the\nneutrino-nucleus collisions includes in-medium effects such as Fermi motion,\nPauli blocking, nuclear binding, and final-state interactions. They are\nimplemented by means of the Giessen Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (GiBUU)\ncoupled-channel transport model. This allows us to study exclusive channels,\nnamely pion production and nucleon knockout. We find that final-state\ninteractions modify considerably the distributions through rescattering,\ncharge-exchange and absorption. Side-feeding induced by charge-exchange\nscattering is important in both cases. In the case of pions, there is a strong\nabsorption associated with the in-medium pionless decay modes of the Delta,\nwhile nucleon knockout exhibits a considerable enhancement of low energy\nnucleons due to rescattering. At neutrino energies above 1 GeV, we also obtain\nthat the contribution to nucleon knockout from Delta excitation is comparable\nto that from quasielastic scattering. \n\n"}
