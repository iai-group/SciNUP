Curve Flows and Solitonic Hierarchies Abstract: The geometric constructions are elaborated on (semi) Riemannian manifolds and\nvector bundles provided with nonintegrable distributions defining nonlinear\nconnection structures induced canonically by metric tensors.

The lifts of\ngeometric objects on tangent bundles are performed for certain classes of\nd-connections and frame transforms when the Riemann tensor is parametrized by\nconstant matrix coefficients. For such configurations, the flows of\nnon-stretching curves and corresponding bi-Hamilton and solitonic hierarchies\nencode information about Ricci flow evolution, Einstein spaces and exact\nsolutions in gravity and geometric mechanics.

We discuss the general case, and then, for the\none-dimensional totally asymmetric case, study the phase transition between an\nactive phase (for sufficiently large particle densities and/or small $\\lambda$)\nand an absorbing one. We also present arguments regarding the asymptotic mean\nhopping velocity in the active phase, the rate of fixation in the absorbing\nphase, and survival of the infinite system at criticality. Using mean-field\ntheory and Monte Carlo simulation, we locate the phase boundary. The phase\ntransition appears to be continuous in both the symmetric and asymmetric\nversions of the process, but the critical behavior is very different. The\nformer case is characterized by simple integer or rational values for critical\nexponents ($\\beta = 1$, for example), and the phase diagram is in accord with\nthe prediction of mean-field theory.

The asymptotics of the spinfoam amplitude is determined by the\ncritical configurations. Here we show that, given a critical configuration in\ngeneral, there exists a partition of the simplicial complex into three type of\nregions R_{Nondeg}, R_{Deg-A}, R_{Deg-B}, where the three regions are\nsimplicial sub-complexes with boundaries. The critical configuration implies\ndifferent types of geometries in different types of regions, i.e. (1) the\ncritical configuration restricted into R_{Nondeg}$ implies a nondegenerate\ndiscrete Lorentzian geometry, (2) the critical configuration restricted into\nR_{Deg-A}$ is degenerate of type-A in our definition of degeneracy, but implies\na nondegenerate discrete Euclidean geometry on R_{Deg-A}, (3) the critical\nconfiguration restricted into R_{Deg-B} is degenerate of type-B, and implies a\nvector geometry on R_{Deg-B}.

But an identification of the deep mechanism\ncausing this dimensional reduction would still be desirable. The main\ncontribution of this article is to show that dimensional reduction effects are\ndue to General Relativity at singularities, and do not need to be postulated\nad-hoc.\n  Recent advances in understanding the geometry of singularities do not require\nmodification of General Relativity, being just non-singular extensions of its\nmathematics to the limit cases. They turn out to work fine for some known types\nof cosmological singularities (black holes and FLRW Big-Bang), allowing a\nchoice of the fundamental geometric invariants and physical quantities which\nremain regular. The resulting equations are equivalent to the standard ones\noutside the singularities.\n  One consequence of this mathematical approach to the singularities in General\nRelativity is a special, (geo)metric type of dimensional reduction: at\nsingularities, the metric tensor becomes degenerate in certain spacetime\ndirections, and some properties of the fields become independent of those\ndirections. Effectively, it is like one or more dimensions of spacetime just\nvanish at singularities.

To better understand such\nbehavior in quantum systems, we extend a known mapping (earlier studied in\nstochastic, or supersymmetric, quantum mechanics) between finite temperature\nclassical Fokker-Planck systems and related quantum systems at zero temperature\nto include general non-equilibrium dynamics. Unlike Feynman mappings or\nstochastic quantization methods (or holographic type dualities), the classical\nsystems that we consider and their quantum duals reside in the same number of\nspace-time dimensions. The upshot of our exact result is that a Wick rotation\nrelates (i) dynamics in general finite temperature classical dissipative\nsystems to (ii) zero temperature dynamics in the corresponding dual many-body\nquantum systems.

However, in this\npaper we construct explicitly canonical maps in 1T phase space (including\ntimelike components, specifically the Hamiltonian) to show that it is\nappropriate to regard various 1T-physics systems, with different Lagrangians or\nHamiltonians, as being duals of each other. This concept is similar in spirit\nto dualities discovered in more complicated examples in field theory or string\ntheory. Our approach makes it evident that such generalized dualities are\nwidespread. This suggests that, as a general phenomenon, there are hidden\nrelations and hidden symmetries that conventional 1T-physics does not capture,\nimplying the existence of a more unified formulation of physics that naturally\nsupplies the hidden information. In fact, we show that 2T-physics in\n(d+2)-dimensions is the generator of these dualities in 1T-physics in\nd-dimensions by providing a holographic perspective that unifies all the dual\n1T systems into one.

This duality serves as a bridge, establishing a profound connection\nbetween the representation theory of finite groups (or permutation groups) and\nthat of classical Lie groups, specifically the unitary groups. From the\nperspective of Schur-Weyl duality, it becomes evident that the computation of\nmatrix integrals over the unitary group is intricately intertwined with the\nso-called Weingarten function. The explicit evaluation of this function is\nheavily dependent on three crucial aspects: firstly, the dimensions of the\nirreducible representations of the unitary groups; secondly, the dimensions of\nthe irreducible representations of permutation groups; and thirdly, the\nirreducible characters of permutation groups. For the first two aspects, we can\nrely on well-established formulae.

If one takes the relativistic\nmomentum to define the hodograph, then for the Sommerfeld (i.e. the special\nrelativistic Kepler/Coulomb problem) there is an effective inverse cube force\nwhich causes the hodograph to precess.

This\nproperty holds for both continuous dynamical systems as well as for discrete\nones defined in discrete space-time. Possibly the simplest example in the\ndiscrete case is that of a linear quadrilateral lattice equation, which can be\nviewed as a linearised version of the well-known lattice potential Korteweg-de\nVries (KdV) equation. In spite of the linearity, the MDC property is\nnon-trivial in terms of the parameters of the system. The Lagrangian aspects of\nsuch equations, and their nonlinear analogues, has led to the notion of\nLagrangian multiform structures, where the Lagrangians are no longer scalar\nfunctions (or volume forms) but genuine forms in a multidimensional space of\nindependent variables.

Here we have formulated a field\ntheoretic perturbation theory that incorporates two-body fields (both of\ndensity-density correlation field and its dual field playing the role of\ntwo-body interaction potential) into a density functional integral\nrepresentation of the Helmholtz free energy. Quadratic density fluctuations are\nonly considered in the saddle-point approximation of two-body fields as well as\ndensity field.

The latter is then shown to exhibit an underlying 'weakly\nnonassociative' (WNA) algebra structure, from which we can conclude, refering\nto previous work, that any solution of the Riccati system also solves the\npotential KP hierarchy (in the corresponding matrix algebra).

I emphasize the rigorous\nnon-perturbative or constructive aspects of the theory. The usual formalism for\nthe renormalization group in field theory or statistical mechanics is reviewed,\ntogether with its limits. The constructive formalism is introduced step by\nstep. Taylor forest formulas allow to perform easily the cluster and Mayer\nexpansions which are needed for a single step of the renormalization group in\nthe case of Bosonic theories. The iteration of this single step leads to\nfurther difficulties whose solution is briefly sketched. The second part of the\ncourse is devoted to Fermionic models. These models are easier to treat on the\nconstructive level, so they are very well suited to beginners in constructive\ntheory. It is shown how the Taylor forest formulas allow to reorganize\nperturbation theory nicely in order to construct the Gross-Neveu2 model without\nany need for cluster or Mayer expansions.

Using this formulation, we show that all spin and\nframed CM systems are identified with hierarchies of tweaking flows on the\ncorresponding spectral sheaves. This generalizes the well-known description of\nspinless CM systems in terms of tangential covers. \n\n"}

Formal Languages for\n  Physics Abstract: This paper is the first in a series whose goal is to develop a fundamentally\nnew way of constructing theories of physics. The motivation comes from a desire\nto address certain deep issues that arise when contemplating quantum theories\nof space and time. Our basic contention is that constructing a theory of\nphysics is equivalent to finding a representation in a topos of a certain\nformal language that is attached to the system. Classical physics arises when\nthe topos is the category of sets. Other types of theory employ a different\ntopos. In this paper we discuss two different types of language that can be\nattached to a system, S. The first is a propositional language, PL(S); the\nsecond is a higher-order, typed language L(S). Both languages provide deductive\nsystems with an intuitionistic logic. The reason for introducing PL(S) is that,\nas shown in paper II of the series, it is the easiest way of understanding, and\nexpanding on, the earlier work on topos theory and quantum physics. However,\nthe main thrust of our programme utilises the more powerful language L(S) and\nits representation in an appropriate topos. \n\n"}

{"id": "solv-int/9801017", "contents": "Title: The classical r-matrix in a geometric framework Abstract: We use a Riemannian (or pseudo-Riemannian) geometric framework to formulate\nthe theory of the classical r-matrix for integrable systems. In this picture\nthe r-matrix is related to a fourth rank tensor, named the r-tensor, on the\nconfiguration space. The r-matrix itself carries one connection type index and\nthree tensorial indices. Being defined on the configuration space it has no\nmomentum dependence but is dynamical in the sense of depending on the\nconfiguration variables. The tensorial nature of the r-matrix is used to derive\nits transformation properties. The resulting transformation formula turns out\nto be valid for a general r-matrix structure independently of the geometric\nframework. Moreover, the entire structure of the r-matrix equation follows\ndirectly from a simple covariant expression involving the Lax matrix and its\ncovariant derivative. Therefore it is argued that the geometric formulation\nproposed here helps to improve the understanding of general r-matrix\nstructures. It is also shown how the Jacobi identity gives rise to a\ngeneralized dynamical classical Yang-Baxter equation involving the Riemannian\ncurvature. \n\n"}
