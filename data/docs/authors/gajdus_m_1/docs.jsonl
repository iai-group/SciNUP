In addition to the pulsar, the X-ray images show a faint\npulsar-wind nebula (PWN) seen up to ~1' from the pulsar. Deconvolution and\nreconstruction of the image reveal a brighter compact PWN component of ~1''\nsize, possibly with a jet-torus morphology. The PWN spectrum fits an absorbed\npower-law (PL) model with the photon index Gamma=1.5. The total PWN luminosity\nin the 0.5-8 keV band, L_{pwn}=3.2\\times10^{33} ergs s^{-1} for d=6.5 kpc, is a\nfraction of 2\\times 10^{-4} of the pulsar's spin-down power and a fraction of\n0.2 of the pulsar's X-ray luminosity, which is a factor of 20 lower than one\nwould expect from an average empirical relation found for a sample of PWNe\nobserved with Chandra.

These external radiation fields control the amount\nof the inverse Compton radiation with respect to the synchrotron flux.\nTherefore the predicted spectral energy distribution (SED) will depend on where\nthe jet dissipates part of its energy to produce the observed radiation.

The VHE gamma-ray absorption, which is energy dependent and increases\nstrongly with redshift, distorts the VHE energy spectra observed from distant\nobjects. The observed energy spectra of the AGNs carry therefore an imprint of\nthe EBL. Recent detections of hard spectra of distant blazars (z = 0.11 - 0.54)\nby H.E.S.S. and MAGIC put strong constraints on the EBL density in the optical\nto near infrared waveband.

We found that 86 of them have a point-like\nX-ray core, consistent with an accreting black hole (BH). We argue that the\nmajority of them are nuclear BHs, rather than X-ray binaries. The fraction of\ngalaxies with an X-ray detected nuclear BH is higher (~60 per cent) for\nellipticals and early-type spirals (E to Sb), and lower (~30 per cent) for\nlate-type spirals (Sc to Sm). There is no preferential association of X-ray\ncores with a large-scale bar; in fact, strongly barred galaxies appear to have\nslightly lower detection fraction and luminosity for their nuclear X-ray\nsources, compared with non-barred or weakly barred galaxies of similar Hubble\ntypes. The cumulative luminosity distribution of the nuclear sources in the\n0.3-8 keV band is a power-law with slope ~-0.5, from ~2 x 10^{38} erg/s to\n~10^{42} erg/s. The Eddington ratio is lower for ellipticals (L_{X}/L_{Edd} ~\n10^{-8}) and higher for late-type spirals (up to L_{X}/L_{Edd} ~ 10^{-4}), but\nin all cases, the accretion rate is low enough to be in the\nradiatively-inefficient regime. The intrinsic NH is generally low, especially\nfor the less luminous sources: there appear to be no Type-2 nuclear BHs at\nluminosities <~ 10^{39} erg/s. The lack of a dusty torus or of other sources of\nintrinsic absorption (e.g., an optically-thick disk wind) may be directly\nrelated to the lack of a standard accretion disk around those faint nuclear\nBHs.

In this work we show that the lack of\ndetection of a GeV spectrum excess in almost all GRBs, though somewhat\nsurprisingly, can be well understood within the standard internal shock model\nand several alternatives like the photosphere-internal shock (gradual magnetic\ndissipation) model and the magnetized internal shock model.

Model results point to ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs)\nfrom supermassive black holes at about the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) energy\nthreshold from low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN), and to high-energy\nphoton emissions from stellar mass black holes in ultra-relativistic capillary\njets.

This superconductor ought to be\nthreaded with rotational vortex lines, within which the star's interior\nmagnetic field is at least partially confined. The vortices (and thus magnetic\nflux) would be expelled from the star during stellar spin-down, leading to\nmagnetic reconnection at the surface of the star and the prolific production of\nthermal energy. In this paper, we show that this energy release can re-heat\nquark stars to exceptionally high temperatures, such as observed for Soft Gamma\nRepeaters (SGRs), Anomalous X-Ray pulsars (AXPs), and X-ray dim isolated\nneutron stars (XDINs). Moreover, our numerical investigations of the\ntemperature evolution, spin-down rate, and magnetic field behavior of such\nsuperconducting quark stars suggest that SGRs, AXPs, and XDINs may be linked\nancestrally.

However, we find that\nthis effect occurs at higher redshifts than previously expected, because\nescape, bremsstrahlung, ionization, and starlight IC losses act to counter this\neffect and preserve the radio luminosity of galaxies. The radio dimming of\nstar-forming galaxies at high z is not just a simple competition between\nmagnetic field energy density and the CMB energy density; the CMB must also\ncompete with every other loss process. We predict relations for the critical\nredshift when radio emission is significantly suppressed compared to the z ~ 0\nFRC as a function of star-formation rate per unit area. Additionally, we\nprovide a quantitative explanation for the relative radio brightness of some\nhigh-z submillimeter galaxies. We show that at fixed star formation rate\nsurface density, galaxies with larger CR scale heights are radio bright with\nrespect to the FRC, because of weaker bremsstrahlung and ionization losses\ncompared to compact starbursts. We predict that these \"puffy starbursts\" should\nhave steeper radio spectra than compact galaxies with the same star-formation\nrate surface density. We find that radio bright submillimeter galaxies alone\ncannot explain the excess radio emission reported by ARCADE2, but they may\nsignificantly enhance the diffuse radio background with respect to a naive\napplication of the z ~ 0 FRC. \n\n"}

Abstract: We study the emission observed at energies greater than 100 MeV of 11 Gamma\nRay Bursts (GRBs) detected by the Fermi/Large Area Telescope (LAT) until\nOctober 2009. The GeV emission has three main properties: (i) its duration is\noften longer than the duration of the softer emission detected by the Gamma\nBurst Monitor (GBM) onboard Fermi [this confirms earlier results from the\nEnergetic Gamma-Ray Experiment Telescope (EGRET)]; (ii) its spectrum is\nconsistent with F(v) propto v^(-1) and does not show strong spectral evolution;\n(iii) for the brightest bursts, the flux detected by the LAT decays as a power\nlaw with a typical slope: t^(-1.5). We argue that the observed >0.1 GeV flux\ncan be interpreted as afterglow emission shortly following the start of the\nprompt phase emission as seen at smaller frequencies. The decay slope is what\nexpected if the fireball emission is produced in the radiative regime, i.e. all\ndissipated energy is radiated away. We also argue that the detectability in the\nGeV energy range depends on the bulk Lorentz factor Gamma of the bursts, being\nstrongly favoured in the case of large Gamma. This implies that the fraction of\nbursts detected at high energies corresponds to the fraction of bursts having\nthe largest Gamma. The radiative interpretation can help to explain why the\nobserved X-ray and optical afterglow energetics are much smaller than the\nenergetics emitted during the prompt phase, despite the fact that the collision\nwith the external medium should be more efficient than internal shocks in\nproducing the radiation we see. \n\n"}

The correlation between times of arrival of radio GPs and\nhigh-energy photons, whether it exists or not, will allow us to choose between\ndifferent origins of GP emission and further constrain the emission physics.\nOur foremost goal was testing whether radio GPs are due to changes in the\ncoherence of the radio emission mechanism, variations in the pair creation rate\nin the pulsar magnetosphere, or changes in the beaming direction.

With the dozen bursts detected in the\n0.1-30 GeV band so far, we start to see some common properties: (i) the\nduration is often longer than the duration of the softer emission detected by\nthe Gamma Burst Monitor (GBM) onboard Fermi; (ii) the spectrum is consistent\nwith F(v)~v^{-1} with no strong spectral evolution; (iii) for the brightest\nbursts, the flux detected by the LAT decays as a power law with a typical\nslope: t^{-1.5}; iv) the peak energy of the GBM emission exceeds 500 keV (rest\nframe). These properties suggest a similar process for the origin of the GeV\nflux. We propose that it is afterglow synchrotron emission shortly following\nthe start of the prompt phase. The steep decay slope suggests that the fireball\nemits in the radiative regime, i.e. all dissipated energy is radiated away. The\nlarge peak energy of the GBM flux suggests that electron-positron pairs might\nplay a crucial role. The rapid onset, but with some delay, of the GeV flux with\nrespect to the GBM one suggests that the bulk Lorentz factor Gamma of these\nbursts is of the order of 1000. Therefore the relatively small fraction of\nbursts detected at high energies might correspond to the fraction of bursts\nhaving the largest Gamma.

We find that these electrons remain confined to the\nshock front, as long as the upstream magnetic field is >~ 10 micro-Gauss, and\ndon't suffer substantial radiative losses, the only condition required is that\nthe external reverse shock emission be not too bright: peak flux less than 1 Jy\nin order to produce photons of 100 MeV, and less than ~100 mJy for producing\n1-GeV photons.

However, many models also\npredict a very high energy (VHE) emission (above hundreds of GeV) when the\nsource displays relativistic persistent jets or transient ejections. Therefore,\ndetecting such emission would improve the understanding of the jet physics.

We investigate\nthe impact upon the supernova neutrino transition probabilities as a function\nof the neutrino mixing angle theta_13 and turbulence amplitude.

The time-averaged continuum emission is\nwell fitted by a single powerlaw of photon index Gamma = 1.75 and from\nconsideration of the Fermi flux limit we constrain the high energy cutoff to be\n350 keV < E < 25 MeV. Line emission from both near-neutral iron K_alpha at 6.39\nkeV and highly ionised iron, from Fe_(xxv) and Fe_(xxvi), is strongly detected\nin the Suzaku spectrum, further confirming the results of previous observations\nwith Chandra and XMM-Newton. We find the centroid energies for the Fe_(xxv) and\nFe_(xxvi) emission to be 6.60 keV and 6.95 keV respectively, with the latter\nappearing to be resolved in the Suzaku spectrum. We show that the Fe_(xxv) and\nFe_(xxvi) emission can result from a highly photo-ionised plasma of column\ndensity N_(H) ~ 3 x 10^(23) cm^(-2). A Compton reflection component, e.g.,\noriginating from an optically-thick accretion disc or a Compton-thick torus,\nappears either very weak or absent in this AGN, subtending < 1 sr to the X-ray\nsource, consistent with previous findings. Indeed the absence of either neutral\nor ionised Compton reflection coupled with the lack of any relativistic Fe K\nsignatures in the spectrum suggests that an inner, optically-thick accretion\ndisc is absent in this source. Instead, the accretion disc could be truncated\nwith the inner regions perhaps replaced by a Compton-thin Radiatively\nInefficient Accretion Flow.

A relativistic jet is capable of accelerating lower-energy heavy\nseed cosmic rays (CRs) to UHECRs on timescales comparable to the time it takes\nthe jet to pierce the large gaseous cloud.

The flat or\ninverted spectrum covers the whole radio band and has been established also at\nmillimeter and infrared wavelengths. When this kind of radio emission is\nspatially resolved it appears as a continuous jet, the so-called \"steady jet\".\nIn contrast, transient jets associated with optically thin events are resolved\nas \"plasmoids\" moving at relativistic speeds away from the center of the\nsystem. The most important point is that the two kinds of radio emission and\ntheir corresponding types of ejections seem to be related to each other; the\noptically thin outburst that characterizes the transient jet occurs after an\ninterval of emission with flat/inverted spectrum.

Unfortunately, a confident\ninference of the jet opening angle usually requires broadband measurement of\nthe afterglow of the GRB, from the X-ray down to the radio and from minutes to\ndays after the prompt gamma-ray emission, which may be difficult to obtain. For\nthis reason, very few of all detected GRBs have constrained jet angles.

However, recent\nobservations of a delayed high energy component have encouraged alternative\nmodels. Here we use a recently developed formulation of relativistic shocks to\nsimulate GRBs.

These\nsimulations are very realistic and present significant improvement with respect\nto previous phenomenological GRB simulations. They reproduce light curves of\nseparated peaks of real GRBs and variety of observed spectral slopes at E >\nE_{peak}. The high energy emission can be explained by synchrotron emission and\na subdominant contribution from inverse Compton.

We show that the gap refills during the late\nGW-driven phase of the inspiral, leading to a sudden EM brightening of the\nsource. The accretion disk leaves an imprint on the GW through its angular\nmomentum exchange with the binary, the mass increase of the binary members due\nto accretion, and its gravity. We compute the disk-modified GWs both in an\nanalytical Newtonian approximation and in a numerical effective-one-body\napproach. We find that disk-induced migration provides the dominant\nperturbation to the inspiral, with weaker effects from the mass accretion onto\nthe CO and hydrodynamic drag. Depending on whether a gap is present, the\nperturbation of the GW phase is between 10 and 1000 radians per year,\ndetectable with the future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) at high\nsignificance. The Fourier transform of the disk-modified GW in the stationary\nphase approximation is sensitive to disk parameters with a frequency trend\ndifferent from post-Newtonian vacuum corrections.

Neutron Stars Abstract: A moderately spinning neutron star acquires an oblate shape and a spacetime\nwith a significant quadrupole moment.

In this paper, we develop a ray-tracing\nalgorithm to calculate the apparent surface areas of moderately spinning\nneutron stars making use of the Hartle-Thorne metric. This analytic metric\nallows us to calculate various observables of the neutron star in a way that\ndepends only on its macroscopic properties and not on the details of its\nequation of state. We use this algorithm to calculate the changes in the\napparent surface area, which could play a role in measurements of neutron star\nradii and, therefore, in constraining their equation of state. We show that\nwhether the spinning neutron star appears larger or smaller than its\nnon-rotating counterpart depends primarily on its equatorial radius. For\nneutron stars with radii ~10 km, the corrections to the Schwarzschild spacetime\ncause the apparent surface area to increase with spin frequency. In contrast,\nfor neutron stars with radii ~15 km, the oblateness of the star dominates the\nspacetime corrections and causes the apparent surface area to decrease with\nincreasing spin frequency.

We derive the PN ST corrections to the Fourier\ntransform of the gravitational wave response and map it to the parameterized\npost-Einsteinian framework. We use the effective-one-body framework adapted to\nEMRIs to calculate the ST modifications to the gravitational waveform. We find\nthat such corrections are smaller than those induced in the early inspiral of\ncomparable-mass binaries, leading to projected bounds on the coupling that are\nworse than current Solar System ones. Brans-Dicke theory modifies the\nweak-field, with deviations in the energy flux that are largest at small\nvelocities. For massive theories, superradiance can lead to resonances in the\nscalar energy flux that can lead to floating orbits outside the innermost\nstable circular orbit and that last until the supermassive black hole loses\nenough mass and spin-angular momentum. If such floating orbits occur in the\nfrequency band of LISA, they would lead to a large dephasing (~1e6 rads),\npreventing detection with GR templates. A detection that is consistent with GR\nwould then rule out floating resonances at frequencies lower than the lowest\nobserved frequency, allowing for the strongest constraints yet on massive ST\ntheories. \n\n"}

In the low L_X limit, gas accretes in a stable,\nspherically symmetric fashion. In the high L_X limit, the inner gas is\nsignificantly heated up and expands, reducing the central mass inflow rate. The\nexpanding gas can turn into a strong enough outflow capable of expelling most\nof the gas at larger radii.

During both observations\nthe 2-10 keV luminosity of the source was close to ~10^{33} erg/s for an\nassumed distance of 10 kpc. However, we note that the distance to this source\nis not well constrained and it has been suggested it might be as far as 35 kpc\nwhich would result in an order of magnitude higher luminosities. If the\nempirically found relation between the orbital period and the quiescence\nluminosity of black hole transients is also valid for IGR J17091-3624, then we\ncan estimate an orbital period of >100 hours (>4 days) for a distance of 10 kpc\nbut it could be as large as tens of days if the source is truly much further\naway.

We introduce a novel method of data randomization to evaluate\nquantitatively the effect of these biases and to assess the intrinsic\nsignificance of an apparent correlation between radio and gamma-ray flux\ndensities of blazars. The novelty of the method lies in a combination of data\nrandomization in luminosity space (to ensure that the randomized data are\nintrinsically, and not just apparently, uncorrelated) and significance\nassessment in flux space (to explicitly avoid Malmquist bias and automatically\naccount for the limited dynamical range in both frequencies). The method is\napplicable even to small samples that are not selected with strict statistical\ncriteria. For larger samples we describe a variation of the method in which the\nsample is split in redshift bins, and the randomization is applied in each bin\nindividually; this variation is designed to yield the equivalent to\nluminosity-function sampling of the underlying population in the limit of very\nlarge, statistically complete samples.

In order to investigate\nthe effect of very strong magnetic field, we focus only on systems in which a\nmaximum of either one, two or three Landau level(s) is/are occupied.

Important for the particle production at intermediate values of transverse\nmomentum (p_t) are jet-hadrons produced inside the fluid. They pick up quarks\nand antiquarks (or diquarks) from the thermal matter rather than creating them\nvia the Schwinger mechanism -- the usual mechanism of hadron production from\nstring fragmentation. These hadrons carry plasma properties (flavor, flow), but\nalso the large momentum of the transversely moving string segment connecting\nquark and antiquark (or diquark). They therefore show up at quite large values\nof p_t, not polluted by soft particle production. We will show that this\nmechanism leads to a pronounced peak in the lambda / kaon ratio at intermediate\np_t.

We report here on MAXI, RXTE, Swift, and\nXMM-Newton observations during its 2010/2011 outburst. We find that during the\nfirst one and a half week of the outburst the X-ray light curves display drops\nin intensity at regular intervals, which we interpret as absorption dips. About\nthree weeks into the outbursts, again drops in intensity are seen. These dips\nhave, however, a spectral behaviour opposite to that of the absorption dips,\nand are related to fast spectral state changes (hence referred to as transition\ndips). The absorption dips recur with a period of 2.414+/-0.005 hrs, which we\ninterpret as the orbital period of the system. This implies that MAXI J1659-152\nis the shortest period black-hole candidate binary known to date. The\ninclination of the accretion disk with respect to the line of sight is\nestimated to be 65-80 degrees. We propose the companion to the black-hole\ncandidate to be close to an M5 dwarf star, with a mass and radius of about\n0.15-0.25 M_sun and 0.2-0.25 R_sun, respectively. We derive that the companion\nhad an initial mass of about 1.5 M_sun, which evolved to its current mass in\nabout 5-6 billion years.

We estimate that these outflows are potentially\ndepositing energy into their host galaxies at considerable rates\n(~10^(43)-10^(45)erg/s); however, due to the lack of constraints on the density\nof the outflowing material and the structure of the outflow, these estimates\nshould be taken as illustrative only.

With enhanced mixing, our synthetic LCs start their post-breakout\nre-brightening phase earlier, follow a more gradual rise to peak, appear\nredder, and fade faster after peak due to enhanced gamma-ray escape.\nNon-thermal electrons, crucial for the production of HeI lines, deposit a\ndominant fraction of their energy as heat. Because energy deposition is\ngenerally local well after the LC peak, the broad HeI lines characteristic of\nmaximum-light SN IIb/Ib spectra require mixing that places 56Ni and helium\nnuclei to within a gamma-ray mean-free-path.

Compact stars can\nhave such exotic states up to their surface (called strange stars (SS)) or they\ncan have quark core surrounded by hadronic matter, known as hybrid stars (HS).\nAs the state of matter of the resultant SS/HS is different from the initial\nhadronic matter, their masses also differ. Therefore, such conversion leads to\nhuge energy release, sometimes of the order of $10^{53}$ ergs. In the present\nwork we study the qualitative energy released by such conversion. Recent\nobservations reveal huge surface magnetic field in certain stars, termed\nmagnetars. Such huge magnetic fields can modify the equations of state (EOS) of\nthe matter describing the star. Therefore, the mass of magnetars are different\nfrom normal NS. The energy released during the conversion process from neutron\nmagnetar (NM) to strange magnetar/hybrid magnetar (SS/HS) is different from\nnormal NS to SS/HS conversion. In this work we calculate the energy release\nduring the phase transition in magnetars. The energy released during NS to\nSS/HS conversion exceeds the energy released during NM to SM/HM conversion.

The physical\nparameters of the model - proton injection rate, electron-to-proton ratio and\ndownstream magnetic field strength - are determined through a fit of the result\nto the observed spatially-integrated synchrotron emission properties. The only\nremaining unknown astronomical parameter, the circumstellar gas number density,\nis determined by a normalization of the amplitude of the gamma-ray flux to the\nobserved amplitude. The bipolar morphology of both nonthermal X-ray and\ngamma-ray emissions is explained by the preferential injection of suprathermal\nnuclei and subsequent magnetic field amplification in the quasi-parallel\nregions of the outer supernova shock. The above parameters provide an improved\nfit to all existing nonthermal emission data, including the TeV emission\nspectrum recently detected by H.E.S.S., with the circumstellar hydrogen gas\nnumber density $N_H\\approx 0.06 cm^{-3}$ close to values derived from\nobservations of thermal X-rays.

There is an extended zone around the magnetar where\nthe plasma flow is ultra-relativistic; its Lorentz factor is self-regulated so\nthat it can marginally scatter thermal photons. The flow becomes slow and\nopaque in an outer equatorial zone, where the decelerated plasma accumulates\nand annihilates; this region serves as a reflector for the thermal photons\nemitted by the neutron star.

Each\nobservation has been fitted with a realistic thermal comptonisation model for\nthe continuum emission. Prompted by the correlation between the UV and soft\nX-ray flux, we use a thermal comptonisation component for the soft X-ray\nexcess. The UV to X-rays/gamma-rays emission of Mrk 509 can be well fitted by\nthese components. The presence of a relatively hard high-energy spectrum points\nto the existence of a hot (kT~100 keV), optically-thin (tau~0.5) corona\nproducing the primary continuum. On the contrary, the soft X-ray component\nrequires a warm (kT~1 keV), optically-thick (tau~15) plasma. Estimates of the\namplification ratio for this warm plasma support a configuration close to the\n\"theoretical\" configuration of a slab corona above a passive disk. An\ninteresting consequence is the weak luminosity-dependence of its emission, a\npossible explanation of the roughly constant spectral shape of the soft X-ray\nexcess seen in AGNs. The temperature (~ 3 eV) and flux of the soft-photon field\nentering and cooling the warm plasma suggests that it covers the accretion disk\ndown to a transition radius $R_{tr}$ of 10-20 $R_g$.

We resolve this long-standing problem and find that\nHe in the GRB's host HII region is responsible for most of the absorption. We\nshow that the X-ray absorbing column density (N_Hx) is correlated with both the\nneutral gas column density and with the optical afterglow extinction (Av). This\ncorrelation explains the connection between dark bursts and bursts with high\nN_Hx values. From these correlations we exclude an origin of the X-ray\nabsorption which is not related to the host galaxy, i.e. the intergalactic\nmedium or intervening absorbers are not responsible. We find that the\ncorrelation with the dust column has a strong redshift evolution, whereas the\ncorrelation with the neutral gas does not. From this we conclude that the\ncolumn density of the X-ray absorption is correlated with the total gas column\ndensity in the host galaxy rather than the metal column density, in spite of\nthe fact that X-ray absorption is typically dominated by metals. The strong\nredshift evolution of N_Hx/Av is thus a reflection of the cosmic metallicity\nevolution of star-forming galaxies. We conclude that the absorption of X-rays\nin GRB afterglows is caused by He in the HII region hosting the GRB. While dust\nis destroyed and metals are stripped of all of their electrons by the GRB to\ngreat distances, the abundance of He saturates the He-ionising UV continuum\nmuch closer to the GRB, allowing it to remain in the neutral or singly-ionised\nstate.

Although there exists a number of models for HFQPOs, many of these are\nsimply \"notions\" or \"concepts\" without actual calculation derived from fluid or\ndisk physics.

New observations of\nM87 enable us to put forward a comprehensive model for the physical heating\nmechanism. Low-frequency radio observations by LOFAR revealed the absence of\nfossil cosmic-ray (CR) electrons in the radio halo surrounding M87. This puzzle\ncan be resolved by accounting for the CR release from the radio cocoons and the\nsubsequent mixing of CRs with the dense ambient intracluster gas, which\nthermalizes the electrons on a timescale similar to the radio halo age of 40\nMyr. Hadronic interactions of similarly injected CR protons with the ambient\ngas should produce an observable gamma-ray signal in accordance with the steady\nemission of the low state of M87 detected by Fermi and H.E.S.S. Hence, we\nnormalize the CR population to the gamma-ray emission, which shows the same\nspectral slope as the CR injection spectrum probed by LOFAR, thereby supporting\na common origin.

The average spin-down rate in\nthe last 20 years is derived as \\sim 5\\times 10^{-7} s s^{-1}. 4U 2206+54 is a\nvariable source with luminosities of \\sim 10^{35} - 10^{36} erg s^{-1} in the\nrange of 3 -- 100 keV. Its spectrum can be described by an absorbed power-law\nmodel with exponential rolloff. The hydrogen column density and photon index\nshow the anti-correlations with hard X-ray luminosity: low column density and\nsmall photon index at maximum of luminosity. This spectral variation pattern\nsuggests that 4U 2206+54 would be a highly obscured binary system. Furthermore,\nthe possible cyclotron line features are searched for in the spectra of\ndifferent luminosities. The possible cyclotron absorption feature around 30 keV\nis not confirmed in our work. The physical origin and evolutional track of this\nvery slow pulsation neutron star are still unclear. We suggest that 4U 2206+54\nwould be a young system with the long-term spin-down trend, would evolve to a\nlonger spin period range and transit to the spin-up phase similar to 2S\n0114+65. These very slow pulsation X-ray pulsars would belong to a new class of\ncompact objects -- accreting magnetars. \n\n"}

We argue that these observed properties are\ninconsistent with any known class of Galactic transients, and instead suggest a\ncosmological origin. The detection of incoherent radio emission at such\ndistances implies a large emitting region, from which we infer the presence of\nrelativistic ejecta. The observed properties are all consistent with the\npopulation of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), marking the first time\nsuch an outburst has been discovered in the distant universe independent of a\nhigh-energy trigger. We searched for possible high-energy counterparts to\nPTF11agg, but found no evidence for associated prompt emission. We therefore\nconsider three possible scenarios to account for a GRB-like afterglow without a\nhigh-energy counterpart: an \"untriggered\" GRB (lack of satellite coverage), an\n\"orphan\" afterglow (viewing-angle effects), and a \"dirty fireball\" (suppressed\nhigh-energy emission). The observed optical and radio light curves appear\ninconsistent with even the most basic predictions for off-axis afterglow\nmodels. The simplest explanation, then, is that PTF11agg is a normal, on-axis\nlong-duration GRB for which the associated high-energy emission was simply\nmissed. However, we have calculated the likelihood of such a serendipitous\ndiscovery by PTF and find that it is quite small (~ 2.6%).

Markovianity\nimplies a nonlinear magnetospheric system in which state changes occur\nstochastically, corresponding to transitions between local minima in an\neffective potential. State durations (though not transition times) are thus\nlargely decoupled from the characteristic time scales of various magnetospheric\nprocesses. Dyadic states are common but some objects show at least four states\nwith some transitions forbidden. Another case is the long-term intermittent\npulsar B1931+24 that has binary radio-emission and torque states with wide, but\nnon-monotonic duration distributions. It also shows a quasi-period of $38\\pm5$\ndays in a 13-yr time sequence, suggesting stochastic resonance in a Markov\nsystem with a forcing function that could be strictly periodic or\nquasi-periodic.

To account for the principle effects of general\nrelativity (GR), we propose a modification of the standard Newtonian evolution\nequation for the (orbit-averaged) time-varying disk surface density. In our\nmodified equation the viscous torque in the disk is treated in full GR, while\nthe tidal torque is handled in the Newtonian limit. Our GR-hybrid treatment is\nreasonable because the tidal torque is concentrated near the orbital radius of\nthe secondary and is most important prior to binary-disk decoupling, when the\norbital separation is large and resides in the weak-field regime. The tidal\ntorque on the disk diminishes during late merger and vanishes altogether\nfollowing merger. By contrast, the viscous torque drives the flow into the\nstrong-field region and onto the primary during all epochs. Following binary\ncoalescence, the viscous torque alone governs the time-dependent accretion onto\nthe remnant, as well as the temporal behavior, strength and spectrum of the\naftermath electromagnetic radiation from the disk.

The spatial\ndistribution of both IMEs and Fe is extremely asymmetric, with the strongest\nejecta emission in the northern rim. Fe Kalpha emission is particularly\nprominent there, and fits with thermal models indicate strongly oversolar Fe\nabundances.

We show the correlation between\nfield energy and ellipticity for each multipole, that the l=4 multipole has the\nlowest energy, and that l=5 has the lowest ellipticity. We show how a mixed\nmultipolar field creates an observationally testable mismatch between the\nprincipal axes of inertia (to be inferred from gravitational wave data) and the\nmagnetic inclination angle. Strong quadrupole and octupole components (with\namplitudes ~ 10^2 times higher than the dipole) in SGR 0418+5729 still yield\nellipticity ~ 10^{-8}, consistent with current gravitational wave upper limits.\nThe existence of higher multipoles in fast-rotating objects (e.g., newborn\nmagnetars) has interesting implications for the braking law and hence phase\ntracking during coherent gravitational wave searches. \n\n"}

If jet power is coupled to\nblack hole spin, deviations from the jet-disk correlation for a sample of AGN\ncan be used to probe the dispersion of the spin parameter within this sample.\nTo exploit this idea, we matched double-lobed radio sources from the FIRST\nsurvey to spectroscopically confirmed quasars from SDSS.

The optical light curves are\nconsistent with a sinusoidal variability modulated with the orbital period,\nshowing evidence for a strongly irradiated companion star, in agreement with\nprevious findings. The observed colours cannot be accounted for by the\ncompanion star alone, suggesting the presence of an accretion disc during\nquiescence. The system is fainter in all analysed bands compared to previous\nobservations. The R band light curve displays a possible phase offset with\nrespect to the B and V band. Through a combined fit of the multi-band light\ncurves we derive constraints on the companion star and disc fluxes, on the\nsystem distance and on the companion star mass. The irradiation luminosity\nrequired to account for the observed day-side temperature of the companion star\nis consistent with the spin-down luminosity of a millisecond radio pulsar. The\nflux decrease and spectral evolution of the quiescent optical emission observed\ncomparing our data with previous observations, collected over 5 years, cannot\nbe well explained with the contribution of an irradiated companion star and an\naccretion disc alone. The progressive flux decrease as the system gets bluer\ncould be due to a continuum component evolving towards a lower, bluer spectrum.\nWhile most of the continuum component is likely due to the disc, we do not\nexpect it to become bluer in quiescence. Hence we hypothesize that an\nadditional component, such as synchrotron emission from a jet was contributing\nsignificantly in the earlier data obtained during quiescence and then\nprogressively fading or moving its break frequency toward longer wavelengths. \n\n"}

This reflects a more centrally concentrated\npopulation of massive stars in IR-bright galaxies. Furthermore, this\ncentralisation is dominated by a central excess of type Ibc/IIb SNe.

Until now, spectroscopic and timing measurements at X-ray\nenergies in soft gamma-repeaters (SGRs) and anomalous X-ray pulsar (AXPs) have\nbeen the main source of information about the physical properties of a magnetar\nand of its magnetosphere. Spectral fitting in the ~ 0.5-10 keV range allowed to\nvalidate the \"twisted magnetosphere\" model, probing the structure of the\nexternal field and estimating the density and velocity of the magnetospheric\ncurrents. Spectroscopy alone, however, may fail in disambiguating the two key\nparameters governing magnetospheric scattering (the charge velocity and the\ntwist angle) and is quite insensitive to the source geometry. X-ray\npolarimetry, on the other hand, can provide a quantum leap in the field by\nadding two extra observables, the linear polarization degree and the\npolarization angle. Using the bright AXP 1RXS J170849.0-400910 as a template,\nwe show that phase-resolved polarimetric measurements can unambiguously\ndetermine the model parameters, even with a small X-ray polarimetry mission\ncarrying modern photoelectric detectors and existing X-ray optics.

We\nmeasure a neutral hydrogen column density of NH=9e21/cm^2 corresponding to AV~6\nmags. The observed properties of ULASJ1234+0907 - high luminosity and Eddington\nratio, broad lines, moderate column densities and significant infra-red\nemission from re-processed dust - are similar to those predicted by galaxy\nformation simulations for the AGN blowout phase.

We conclude that ULASJ1234+0907 is a prototype galaxy caught at the peak\nepoch of galaxy formation, which is transitioning from a starburst to optical\nquasar via a dusty quasar phase. \n\n"}

The\nmechanism powering such events is thought to be linked to tapping of the\nangular momentum (spin) of the black hole, the rate of accretion through the\ndisc or some combination of the two. We can attempt to discriminate between\nthese possibilities by comparing proxies for jet power with spin estimates. Due\nto the small number of sources reaching Eddington rates and have therefore been\nsuggested to act as 'standard candles', there has been much recent debate as to\nwhether a significant correlation exists between jet power and spin. We perform\ncontinuum fitting to the high-quality, disc-dominated XMM-Newton spectra of the\nextragalactic microquasar discovered in M31. Assuming prograde spin, we find\nthat, for sensible constraints the spin is always very low (a < 0.15 at\n3-sigma). When combined with a proxy for jet power derived from the maximum 5\nGHz radio luminosity during a bright flaring event, we find that the source\nsits well above the previously reported, rising correlation that would indicate\nthat spin tapping is the dominant mechanism for powering the jets. The notable\nexceptions require the inclination to be improbably small or the jet to be very\nfast. We investigate whether this could be a by-product of selecting\nprograde-only spin, finding that the data statistically favour a substantially\nretrograde spin for the same constraints (a < -0.17 at 3-sigma). Although\ntheoretically improbable, this remarkable finding could be confirmation that\nretrograde spin can power such jets via spin-tapping, as has been suggested for\ncertain radio quasars. In either case this work demonstrates the value of\nstudying local extragalactic microquasars as a means to better understand the\nphysics of jet launching. \n\n"}

In this paper, we propose a novel\nmethod to probe sub-parsec BBHs through microlensing of lensed QSOs. If a QSO\nhosts a sub-parsec BBH in its center, it is expected that the BBH is surrounded\nby a circum-binary disk, each component of the BBH is surrounded by a small\naccretion disk, and a gap is opened by the secondary component in between the\ncircum-binary disk and the two small disks. Assuming such a BBH structure, we\ngenerate mock microlensing light curves for some QSO systems that host BBHs\nwith typical physical parameters. We show that microlensing light curves of a\nBBH QSO system at the infrared-optical-UV bands can be significantly different\nfrom those of corresponding QSO system with a single massive black hole (MBH),\nmainly because of the existence of the gap and the rotation of the BBH (and its\nassociated small disks) around the center of mass. We estimate the half-light\nradii of the emission region at different wavelengths from mock light curves\nand find that the obtained half-light radius vs. wavelength relations of BBH\nQSO systems can be much flatter than those of single MBH QSO systems at a\nwavelength range determined by the BBH parameters, such as the total mass, mass\nratio, separation, accretion rates, etc. The difference is primarily due to the\nexistence of the gap. Such unique features on the light curves and half-light\nradius-wavelength relations of BBH QSO systems can be used to select and probe\nsub-parsec BBHs in a large number of lensed QSOs to be discovered by current\nand future surveys, including the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response\nSystem (Pan-STARRS), the Large Synoptic Survey telescope (LSST) and Euclid. \n\n"}

We investigate this by performing a detailed time-resolved spectral\nanalysis of the superburst from 4U 1636-536 observed in 2001 with the Rossi\nX-ray Timing Explorer. Superbursts are attributed to the thermonuclear burning\nof carbon, and are approximately 1000 times more energetic than the regular\nshort Type I bursts. This allows us to study detailed spectra for over 11 ks,\ncompared to at most 100 s for regular bursts. A feature is present in the\nsuperburst spectra around 6.4 keV that is well fit with an emission line and an\nabsorption edge, suggestive of reflection of the superburst off the accretion\ndisk. The line and edge parameters evolve over time: the edge energy decreases\nfrom 9.4 keV at the peak to 8.1 keV in the tail, and both features become\nweaker in the tail. This is only the second superburst for which this has been\ndetected, and shows that this behavior is present even without strong radius\nexpansion. Furthermore, we find the persistent flux to almost double during the\nsuperburst, and return to the pre-superburst level in the tail. The combination\nof reflection features and increased persistent emission indicates that the\nsuperburst had a strong impact on the inner accretion disk, and it emphasizes\nthat X-ray bursts provide a unique probe of accretion physics. \n\n"}

This energy range is indeed\nassociated with non-thermal phenomena and challenging particle acceleration\nprocesses.

These proton-proton\n($pp$) collisions also produce high-energy gamma-rays, which finally contribute\nto the diffuse high-energy gamma-ray background. We calculate the diffuse\ngamma-ray flux with a semi-analytic approach and consider that the very high\nenergy gamma-rays will be absorbed in the galaxies and converted into\nelectron-position pairs, which then lose almost all their energy through\nsynchrotron radiation in the strong magnetic fields in the starburst region.\nSince the synchrotron emission goes into energies below GeV, this synchrotron\nloss reduces the diffuse high-energy gamma-ray flux by a factor of about two,\nthus leaving more room for other sources to contribute to the gamma-ray\nbackground. For a $E_\\nu^{-2}$ neutrino spectrum, we find that the diffuse\ngamma-ray flux contributes about 20% of the observed diffuse gamma-ray\nbackground in the 100 GeV range.

We here explore the yet unknown origin for this\nuniversality. First, we investigate which region of the neutron star's interior\nand of the equation of state is most responsible for the universality. We find\nthat the universal relation between the moment of inertia and the quadrupole\nmoment is dominated by the star's outer-core, a shell of width (50-95)% of the\ntotal radius, which corresponds to the density range\n$(10^{14}$-$10^{15})$g/cm$^3$. Second, we study the impact on the universality\nof approximating stellar isodensity contours as self-similar ellipsoids. An\nanalytical calculation in the Newtonian limit reveals that the shape of the\nellipsoids does not affect the universal relations, but relaxing the\nself-similarity assumption can completely destroy it. Third, we investigate the\neccentricity profiles of rotating relativistic stars and find that the\nellipticity is roughly constant, with variations of roughly (20-30)% in the\nregion that matters to the universal relations. Fourth, we repeat the above\nanalysis for non-compact, regular stars and find that the ellipticity is not\nconstant, with variations that easily exceed 100% and universality is lost.\nThese findings suggest that universality arises as an emergent approximate\nsymmetry: as one flows in the stellar-structure phase space from non-compact\nstar region to the relativistic star region, the eccentricity variation inside\nstars decreases, leading to approximate self-similarity in their isodensity\ncontours, which then leads to the universal behavior observed in their exterior\nmultipole moments. \n\n"}

We show that hysteresis does not require large changes in\nluminosity and it is the natural form that state transitions take at these\nluminosities. At higher accretion rates neutron stars do not show hysteresis,\nand they remain in a thermal dominated, low variability state, characterized by\nflaring behaviour and fast colour changes.

In this paper we examine the X-ray time lags in this source using a\ntotal of 600 ks in observations (440 ks exposure) taken with the XMM-Newton\ntelescope (300 ks in 2001 and 300 ks in 2013). Both the old and new\nobservations show the usual hard lag that increases with energy, however, the\nhard lag turns over to a soft lag at frequencies below ~1e-4 Hz. The highest\nfrequencies (~1e-3 Hz) in this source show a clear soft lag, as previously\npresented for the first 300 ks observation, but no clear iron K lag is detected\nin either the old or new observation. The soft lag is more significant in the\nold observation than the new. The observations are consistent with a\nreverberation interpretation, where the soft, reflected emission is delayed\nwith respect to the hard powerlaw component. These spectral timing results\nsuggest that two distinct variability mechanisms are important in this source:\nintrinsic coronal variations (which lead to correlated variability in the\nreprocessed emission), and geometrical changes in the corona. Variability due\nto geometrical changes does not result in correlated variability in the\nreflection, and therefore inhibits the clear detection of an iron K lag. \n\n"}

Our three directions are as follows. (i) Taking the variable\nsodium absorption lines in some SN Ia to originate in a massive circumstellar\nmatter (CSM), as has been claimed recently, we use the results of Sternberg et\nal. (2014) to imply that > ~20% of SN Ia occur inside a PN (or a PN\ndescendant), hence classify them as SNIPs. (ii) We next use results that show\nthat whenever there are hydrogen lines in SN Ia the hydrogen mass in the CSM is\nlarge (> 1 M_Sun), hence the explosion is a SNIP. We make the simplest\nassumption that the probability for explosion is constant in time for up to\nabout 10^5 yrs after the merger of the core with the white dwarf (WD) in the\nframe of the core-degenerate scenario.

We show\nthat in the hierarchical (in separation) three-body problem, one of the BHs and\na dark matter particle form an inner binary. Gravitational perturbations from\nthe BH companion, on a much wider orbit, can cause the dark matter particle to\nreach extremely high eccentricities and even get accreted onto the BH, by what\nis known as the Eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) mechanism. We show that this may\nproduce a torus-like configuration for the dark matter distribution around the\nless massive member of the BH binary. We first consider an Intermediate BH\n(IMBH) in the vicinity of our Galactic Center, which may be a relic of a past\nminor merger. We show that if the IMBH is close enough (i.e., near the stellar\ndisk) the EKL mechanism is very efficient in exciting the eccentricity of dark\nmatter particles in near-polar configurations to extremely high values where\nthey are accreted by the IMBH. We show that this mechanism is even more\neffective if the central BH grows in mass, where we have assumed adiabatic\ngrowth. Since near-polar configurations are disrupted, a torus-like shape is\nformed. We also show that this behavior is also likely to be relevant for\nSupermassive BH binaries. We suggest that if the BHs are spinning, the accreted\ndark matter particles may linger in the ergosphere and thereby may generate\nself-annihilations and produce an indirect signature of potential interest. \n\n"}

Previously it has been shown\nthat conversion of this primordially-generated background of relativistic\nALPs---a cosmic ALP background (CAB)---can explain the observed soft X-ray\nexcess in both the centre and the outskirts of the Coma cluster. Here we extend\nthis work to the three clusters A665, A2199 and A2255. We use a stochastic\nmodel of the cluster magnetic field to numerically calculate ALP-photon\nconversion probabilities to predict the CAB-generated soft X-ray flux in these\nclusters. We compare this flux to ROSAT PSPC observations of the three\nclusters, and use these observations to constrain the CAB parameter space. We\nfind the CAB can reproduce the magnitude of the observed excess in A2199 and\nA2255 for the same CAB parameters that match the observed soft excess in the\nComa cluster. We also find good fit to the morphology of the excesses in these\nclusters. Simulation of CAB conversion in the cluster A665 is in mild tension\nwith the other clusters due to producing a small but observable excess at large\nradii where none is observed. This tension is alleviated considering the\nuncertainty on predicting the count rate in the ROSAT detector, and on the\nsystematics affecting the magnetic field determination. Overall we find good\nagreement between the CAB parameters for the four clusters studied so far. \n\n"}

The\nphysical mechanism mechanism underlying the contribution from the magnetic\nfield is the torque exerted on the rotating black hole by the field amplified\nby the accreting material. If the squared magnetic field is proportional to the\naccretion rate, then there will be a correlation between jet power and\naccretion luminosity.

Previous studies, using\nprompt GRB isotropic equivalent energy ($E_{\\rm iso}$) as a proxy for isotropic\nequivalent kinetic energy, have generally confirmed a correlation between X-ray\nand optical afterglow luminosities.

In the conventional diffusion\nmodel, a global analysis is performed on the spectral features of CR electrons\nand the diffuse gamma rays by GALRPOP package. The results show that the\nspectrum structure of the primary component of CR electrons can not be fully\nreproduced by a simple power law and the relevant break is around hundred GeV.\nAt 99\\% C.L., the injection indices above the break decrease from 2.54 to 2.35,\nbut the ones below the break are only in the range 2.746 - 2.751.

For comparison, we have also analyzed two\nsimilarly-aged, ejecta-dominated SNRs: Tycho's SNR, thought to be the remnant\nof a typical Type Ia SN, and SNR 0509-67.5 in the Large Magellanic Cloud,\nthought to be the remnant of an overluminous Type Ia SN. By simply comparing\nthe X-ray spectra, we find that line intensity ratios of iron-group elements\n(IGE) to intermediate-mass elements (IME) for Kepler's SNR and SNR 0509-67.5\nare much higher than those for Tycho's SNR. We therefore argue that Kepler is\nthe product of an overluminous Type Ia SN. This inference is supported by our\nspectral modeling, which reveals the IGE and IME masses respectively to be\n~0.95 M_sun and ~0.12 M_sun (Kepler's SNR), ~0.75 M_sun and ~0.34 M_sun (SNR\n0509-67.5), and ~0.35 M_sun and ~0.70 M_sun (Tycho's SNR). We find that the CSM\ncomponent in Kepler's SNR consists of tenuous diffuse gas (~0.3 M_sun) present\nthroughout the entire remnant, plus dense knots (~0.035 M_sun). Both of these\ncomponents have an elevated N abundance (N/H ~ 4 times the solar value),\nsuggesting that they originate from CNO-processed material from the progenitor\nsystem. The mass of the diffuse CSM allows us to infer the pre-SN mass-loss\nrate to be ~1.5e-5 (V_w/10 km/s) M_sun/yr, in general agreement with results\nfrom recent hydrodynamical simulations. Since the dense knots have slow proper\nmotions and relatively small ionization timescales, they were likely located a\nfew pc away from the progenitor system. Therefore, we argue that Kepler's SN\nwas an overluminous event that started to interact with massive CSM a few\nhundred years after the explosion.

Several competing scenarios have been\nproposed to explain such occurrences, including various jet plasma\ninstabilities leading to the formation of shocks, magnetic reconnection sites,\nand turbulence. In this letter we present the results of our detailed\ninvestigation of a prominent, five-hour-long optical microflare detected during\nrecent WEBT campaign in 2014, March 2-6 targeting the blazar 0716+714. After\nseparating the flaring component from the underlying base emission continuum of\nthe blazar, we find that the microflare is highly polarized, with the\npolarization degree $\\sim (40-60)\\%$$\\pm (2-10)\\%$, and the electric vector\nposition angle $\\sim (10 - 20)$deg$\\pm (1-8)$deg slightly misaligned with\nrespect to the position angle of the radio jet. The microflare evolution in the\n$(Q,\\,U)$ Stokes parameter space exhibits a looping behavior with a\ncounter-clockwise rotation, meaning polarization degree decreasing with the\nflux (but higher in the flux decaying phase), and approximately stable\npolarization angle. The overall very high polarization degree of the flare, its\nsymmetric flux rise and decay profiles, and also its structured evolution in\nthe $Q-U$ plane, all imply that the observed flux variation corresponds to a\nsingle emission region characterized by a highly ordered magnetic field. As\ndiscussed in the paper, a small-scale but strong shock propagating within the\noutflow, and compressing a disordered magnetic field component, provides a\nnatural, though not unique, interpretation of our findings. \n\n"}

Using a Semi-Analytical Shower Model Abstract: The High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) is an array of five Imaging\nAtmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) designed to detect cosmogenic\ngamma-rays with very high energies. Originally consisting of just four\nidentical IACTs (CT1-4) with an effective mirror diameter of 12$\\,$m each, it\nwas expanded with a fifth IACT (CT5) with a mirror diameter of 28$\\,$m in 2012.\nBeing the largest IACT worldwide, CT5 allows to lower the energy threshold of\nH.E.S.S., making the array sensitive at energies where space-based detectors\nrun out of statistics. Events can be analysed either monoscopically (i.e. using\nonly information of CT5) or stereoscopically (requiring at least two triggered\ntelescopes per event). To achieve a good performance, a sophisticated event\nreconstruction and analysis framework is indispensable. This is particularly\nimportant for H.E.S.S. since it is now the first IACT array that consists of\ndifferent telescope types. An advanced reconstruction method is based on a\nsemi-analytical model of electromagnetic particle showers in the atmosphere\n(model analysis). The properties of the primary particle are reconstructed by\ncomparing the image recorded by each triggered telescope with the Cherenkov\nemission from the shower model using a log-likelihood maximisation. Due to its\nperformance, this method has become one of the standard analysis techniques\napplied to CT1-4 data. Now it has been modified for use with the five-telescope\narray.

These relations become\nexact for stationary black holes in General Relativity as shown by the no-hair\ntheorems. In this paper, we take the first steps toward studying how the\napproximate I-Love-Q relations become exact in the limit as compact stars\nbecome black holes. To do so, we consider a toy model, i.e. incompressible\nstars with anisotropic pressure, which allows us to model an equilibrium\nsequence of stars with their compactness approaching the black hole limit\narbitrarily closely. We extract the I-Love-Q trio by numerically constructing\nsuch a sequence in the slow-rotation and small-tide approximations. We find\nthat the I-Love-Q relations approach the black hole limit in a nontrivial way,\nwith the quadrupole moment and the tidal deformability changing sign as the\ncompactness and the amount of anisotropy are increased. Generalizing Maclaurin\nspheroids to anisotropic stars, we show that the multipole moments also change\nsign in the Newtonian limit as the amount of anisotropy is increased.

Below ~0.5-1 per cent of the Eddington accretion rate (m_crit), the\nspectral index hardens with increasing accretion rate, but above m_crit,\nalthough still in the hard state, the spectral index softens with increasing\naccretion rate. Here we use a combination of X-ray spectral fitting and a study\nof short time-scale spectral variability to examine the behaviour of three\nwell-known X-ray binaries: Cygnus X-1, GX 339-4 and XTE J1118+480.\n  In Cygnus X-1 we find separate hard and soft continuum components, and show\nusing root-mean-square (rms) spectra that the soft component dominates the\nvariability. The spectral transition at m_crit is clearly present in the\nhard-state hardness-intensity diagrams of Cygnus X-1. Above m_crit, GX 339-4\nshows similar softer-when-brighter behaviour at both long and short\ntime-scales. Similarly, XTE J1118+480, which remains well below m_crit, is\nharder-when-brighter behaviour on all time-scales.\n  We interpret these results in terms of two continuum components: a hard\npower-law which dominates the spectra when the accretion rate is low, probably\narising from Comptonisation of cyclo-synchrotron photons from the corona, and a\nsoft power-law which dominates at higher accretion rates, arising from\nComptonisation of seed photons from the accretion disc. \n\n"}

We present an\nexploratory study of this mechanism in the intra-cluster-medium (ICM). In view\nof large-scale turbulence in the ICM we adopt a reconnection scheme that is\nbased on turbulent reconnection and MHD turbulence. In this case particles are\naccelerated and decelerated in a systematic way in reconnecting and\nmagnetic-dynamo regions, respectively, and on longer time-scales undergo a\nstochastic process diffusing across these sites (similar to second-order\nFermi).

It was conjectured in\narXiv:1403.2757, that the existence of such clouds at the linear level implies\nthe existence of a new family of BH solutions at the non-linear level. We\nconfirm this expectation and explicitly construct examples of such Kerr black\nholes with Proca hair (KBHsPH). For a single complex Proca field, these BHs\nform a countable number of families with three continuous parameters (ADM mass,\nADM angular momentum and Noether charge). They branch off from the Kerr\nsolutions that can support stationary Proca clouds and reduce to Proca stars\nwhen the horizon size vanishes.

To address this\npoint, we consider the effect of rotation on a quasi-star, as angular momentum\nis inevitably transported towards the galactic nucleus by the accumulating gas.\nUsing a model for the internal redistribution of angular momentum that\nqualitative matches results from simulations of rotating convective stellar\nenvelopes, we show that quasi-stars with an envelope mass greater than a few\n$10^{5}$ M$_{\\odot} \\times (\\rm black~hole~mass/100 M_{\\odot})^{0.82}$ have\nhighly sub-keplerian gas motion in their core, preventing gas circularisation\noutside the black hole's horizon.

At the region of interest, crystal bulk\ncontamination is the dominant background source. Contributions from 210Pb, 40K,\n22Na and 3H are the most relevant. Those from 40K and 22Na could be efficiently\nsuppressed thanks to anticoincidence operation in a crystals matrix or inside a\nLiquid Scintillator Veto (LSV), while that from 210Pb has been reduced by\nimproving crystal production methods and 3H production could be reduced by\nshielding against cosmic rays during production. Assuming the activities of the\nlast characterized detector, for nine crystals with a total mass of 112.5 kg\nthe expected background rate is 2.5 counts/(keV kg d) in the region from 1 to 4\nkeV, which could be reduced at 1.4 counts/(keV kg d) by using a LSV. \n\n"}

For each peak in the LS\nperiodogram, we evaluate the statistical significance in two different ways.\nThe first method involves calculating the False Alarm Probability (FAP) using\nnon-parametric bootstrap resampling, and the second method is by calculating\nthe difference in Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) between the null\nhypothesis, viz. the data contains only noise, compared to the hypothesis that\nthe data contains a peak at a given frequency. Using these methods, we scan the\nfrequency range between 7-14 cycles per year to look for any peaks caused by\nsolar rotation, since this is the proposed explanation for the statistically\nsignificant peaks found by Sturrock and collaborators in the Super-K dataset.\nFrom our analysis, we do confirm that similar to Sturrock et al, the maximum\npeak occurs at a frequency of 9.42/year, corresponding to a period of 38.75\ndays. The FAP for this peak is about 1.5% and the difference in BIC (between\npure white noise and this peak) is about 4.8.

Recent galaxy formation simulations\nhave demonstrated the need for active CR transport either in the form of\ndiffusion or streaming to successfully launch winds in galaxies. However, due\nto computational limitations, most previous simulations have modeled CR\ntransport isotropically. Here, we discuss high resolution simulations of\nisolated disk galaxies in a $10^{11}\\rm{M_\\odot}$ halo with the moving mesh\ncode {\\sc Arepo} that include injection of CRs from supernovae, advective\ntransport, CR cooling, and CR transport through isotropic or anisotropic\ndiffusion. We show that either mode of diffusion leads to the formation of\nstrong bipolar outflows. However, they develop significantly later in the\nsimulation with anisotropic diffusion compared to the simulation with isotropic\ndiffusion. Moreover, we find that isotropic diffusion allows most of the CRs to\nquickly diffuse out of the disk, while in the simulation with anisotropic\ndiffusion, most CRs remain in the disk once the magnetic field becomes\ndominated by its azimuthal component, which occurs after $\\sim 300\\,{\\rm\nMyrs}$. This has important consequences for the gas dynamics in the disk. In\nparticular, we show that isotropic diffusion strongly suppresses the\namplification of the magnetic field in the disk compared to anisotropic or no\ndiffusion models. We therefore conclude that reliable simulations which include\nCR transport inevitably need to account for anisotropic diffusion. \n\n"}

Using images from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), we\nhave discovered transient 3.4 micron emission from several previously known\ntidal disruption flares. The observations can be explained by dust heated to\nits sublimation temperature due to the intense radiation of the tidal flare.\nFrom the break in the infrared light curve we infer that this hot dust is\nlocated ~0.1 pc from the supermassive black hole. Since the dust has been\nheated by absorbing UV and (potentially) soft X-ray photons of the flare, the\nreprocessing light curve yields an estimate of the bolometric flare luminosity.\nFor the flare PTF-09ge, we infer that the most likely value of the luminosity\nintegrated over frequencies at which dust can absorb photons is $8\\times\n10^{44}$ erg/s, with a factor of 3 uncertainty due to the unknown temperature\nof the dust.

Recent\nterrestrial experiments constrain both its value and slope at nuclear\nsaturation density, however, its value at higher densities is unknown. Assuming\na Free Fermi-gas (FFG) model for the kinetic symmetry energy, the high-density\nextrapolation depends on a single parameter, the density dependence of the\npotential symmetry energy. The Correlated Fermi-gas (CFG) model improves on the\nFFG model by including the effects of short-range, correlated, high-momentum,\nnucleons in nuclear matter. Using the CFG model for the kinetic symmetry energy\nalong with constraints from terrestrial measurements leads to a much softer\ndensity dependence for the potential symmetry energy. Purpose: Examine the\nability of the FFG and CFG models to describe NS observables that are directly\nsensitive to the symmetry energy at high-density. Specifically, examine the\nability of the CFG model, with its softer density dependence of the potential\nsymmetry energy, to describe a two solar-mass NS. Methods: Using a Bayesian\nanalysis of NS observables we compare the CFG and FFG models and examine the\nresulting parameters in the NS EOS and the density dependence of the potential\nsymmetry energy.

Firstly, we consider BH\npopulations with two different masses in order to learn basic differences from\nmodels with single-mass BHs only. Secondly, we consider continuous BH mass\nfunctions adapted from recent studies on massive star evolution in a low\nmetallicity environment, where globular clusters are formed. In this work, we\nconsider only binaries that are formed by three-body processes and ignore\nstellar evolution and primordial binaries for simplicity.

However, the physics of tilted discs (e.g., angular momentum\ntransport and jet formation) is poorly understood. Using our new\nGPU-accelerated code H-AMR, we performed 3D general relativistic\nmagnetohydrodynamic simulations of tilted thick accretion discs around rapidly\nspinning BHs, at the highest resolution to date. We explored the limit where\ndisc thermal pressure dominates magnetic pressure, and showed for the first\ntime that, for different magnetic field strengths on the BH, these flows launch\nmagnetized relativistic jets propagating along the rotation axis of the tilted\ndisc (rather than of the BH). If strong large-scale magnetic flux reaches the\nBH, it bends the inner few gravitational radii of the disc and jets into\npartial alignment with the BH spin. On longer time scales, the simulated\ndisc-jet system as a whole undergoes Lense-Thirring precession and approaches\nalignment, demonstrating for the first time that jets can be used as probes of\ndisc precession. When the disc turbulence is well-resolved, our isolated discs\nspread out, causing both the alignment and precession to slow down. \n\n"}

Abstract: Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are energetic astrophysical sources powered by\naccretion onto supermassive black holes in galaxies, and present unique\nobservational signatures that cover the full electromagnetic spectrum over more\nthan twenty orders of magnitude in frequency. The rich phenomenology of AGN has\nresulted in a large number of different \"flavours\" in the literature that now\ncomprise a complex and confusing AGN \"zoo\". It is increasingly clear that these\nclassifications are only partially related to intrinsic differences between\nAGN, and primarily reflect variations in a relatively small number of\nastrophysical parameters as well the method by which each class of AGN is\nselected. Taken together, observations in different electromagnetic bands as\nwell as variations over time provide complementary windows on the physics of\ndifferent sub-structures in the AGN. In this review, we present an overview of\nAGN multi-wavelength properties with the aim of painting their \"big picture\"\nthrough observations in each electromagnetic band from radio to gamma-rays as\nwell as AGN variability.

Strangeon\nstars would be solidified during cooling, and the solid stars would be natural\nto have glitches as the result of starquakes. Based on the starquake model\nestablished before, we proposed that when the starquake occurs, the inner\nmotion of the star which changes the moment of inertia and has impact on the\nglitch sizes, is divided into plastic flow and elastic motion. The plastic flow\nwhich is induced in the fractured part of the outer layer, would move\ntangentially to redistribute the matter of the star and would be hard to\nrecover. The elastic motion, on the other hand, changes its shape and would\nrecover significantly.

From our fully\ngeneral relativistic numerical computations of the structures of fast-spinning\ncompact stars, known as millisecond pulsars, we find that such a stellar\nconversion causes a simultaneous spin-up and decrease in gravitational mass of\nthese stars. This is a new type of millisecond pulsar evolution through a new\nmechanism, which gives rise to relatively lower mass compact stars with higher\nspin rates. This could have implication for the observed mass and spin\ndistributions of millisecond pulsars.

We analyse bolometric and NIR lightcurves of the first detected double\nneutron star merger and compare them to nuclear reaction network-based\nmacronova models. The slope of the bolometric lightcurve is consistent with the\nradioactive decay of neutron star ejecta with $Y_e \\lesssim 0.3$ (but not\nlarger), which provides strong evidence for an r-process origin of the\nelectromagnetic emission. This rules out in particular \"nickel winds\" as major\nsource of the emission. We find that the NIR lightcurves can be well fitted\neither with or without lanthanide-rich ejecta. Our limits on the ejecta mass\ntogether with estimated rates directly confirm earlier purely theoretical or\nindirect observational conclusions that double neutron star mergers are indeed\na major site of cosmic nucleosynthesis.

In general, the empirical relationship\nof SNIa on the absolute peak magnitude $M_{\\rm B}$ is calibrated by Cepheid\nvariables in the near distance scale and directly extrapolated to much farther\ndistances. Two main problems arise. First, their calibration, in particular the\ndetermination of $M_{\\rm B}$, depends on the empirical relationship of Cepheid\nvariables, which suffers from various uncertainties. The second is related to\nthe homogeneity of SNIa in their true $M_{\\rm B}$, which is known to be poor in\ndifferent environments. The observed GW signal of the coalescence of compact\nbinary systems and their electromagnetic counterparts provide the novel and\nmodel-independent way to address these two problems. In the era of\nsecond-generation GW detectors, the low-redshift GW sources provide a novel\nmethod to calibrate the empirical relationship of SNIa, using their\nself-calibrated distances. Here, we use the event GW170817 to calibrate the\nempirical relationship in different low redshift ranges, and find that the\ncalibration results are consistent with the ones derived from the Cepheid\nvariables.

This historical\nevent confirms the origin of short-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), and in\nparticular, identifies the theoretically-predicted kilonova phenomenon that is\npowered by radioactive decays of $r$-process heavy elements. However, whether a\nlong-lived remnant NS could be formed during this merger event remains unknown,\nalthough such a central engine has been suggested by afterglow observations of\nsome short-duration GRBs. By invoking this long-lived remnant NS, we here\npropose a model of hybrid energy sources for the kilonova AT2017gfo associated\nwith GW 170817. While the early emission of AT2017gfo is still powered\nradioactively as usually suggested, its late emission is primarily caused by\ndelayed energy injection from the remnant NS.

We discuss detecting repetition from FRBs, which will be very\nimportant for understanding their physical origin, and which also allows for\nhost galaxy localisation. We show how the combination of instrument\nsensitivity, beamshapes, and individual FRB luminosity functions affect the\ndetection of sources whose repetition is not necessarily described by a\nhomogeneous Poisson process. We demonstrate that the Canadian Hydrogen\nIntensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) could detect many new repeating FRBs for\nwhich host galaxies could be subsequently localised using other\ninterferometers, but it will not be an ideal instrument for monitoring FRB\n121102. If the luminosity distributions of repeating FRBs are given by\npower-laws with significantly more dim than bright bursts, CHIME's repetition\ndiscoveries could preferentially come not from its own discoveries, but from\nsources first detected with lower-sensitivity instruments like the Australian\nSquare Kilometer Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) in fly's eye mode.

The photospheric emission of the outflow\nejected during this phase dominates the observable radiation and peaks in the\nUV/optical bands with a luminosity of 10^42 erg/s. After the accretion rate\ndrops below the Eddington rate, the bolometric luminosity follows the\nconventional t^{-5/3} power-law decay, and X-rays from the inner accretion disk\nstart to be seen. Modeling the newly reported IMBH tidal disruption event\ncandidate 3XMM J2150-0551, we find a general consistency between the data and\npredictions. The search for these luminous, long-term events in GCs and nearby\ndwarf galaxies could unveil the IMBH population. \n\n"}

{"id": "1806.10863", "contents": "Title: Multi-zone non-thermal radiative model for stellar bowshocks Abstract: Context: Runaway stars produce bowshocks that are usually observed at\ninfrared (IR) wavelengths. Non-thermal radio emission has been detected so far\nonly from the bowshock of BD+43{\\deg}3654, whereas the detection of non-thermal\nradiation from these bowshocks at high energies remains elusive. Aims: We aim\nat characterising in detail the radio, X-ray, and gamma-ray emission from\nstellar bowshocks accounting for the structure of the region of interaction\nbetween the stellar wind and its environment. Methods: We develop a\nbroadband-radiative, multi-zone model for stellar bowshocks that takes into\naccount the spatial structure of the emitting region and the observational\nconstraints. The model predicts the evolution and the emission of the\nrelativistic particles accelerated and streaming together with the shocked\nflow. Results: We present broadband non-thermal spectral energy distributions\nfor different scenarios, synthetic radio-cm synchrotron maps that reproduce the\nmorphology of BD+43{\\deg}3654, and updated predictions in X-ray and gamma-ray\nenergy ranges. We also compare the results of the multi-zone model applied in\nthis work with those of a refined one-zone model. Conclusions: A multi-zone\nmodel provides better constraints than a one-zone model on the relevant\nparameters, namely the magnetic field intensity and the amount of energy\ndeposited in non-thermal particles. However, one-zone models can be improved by\ncarefully characterising the intensity of the IR dust photon field and the\nescape rate of the plasma from the shocked region. Finally, comparing observed\nradio maps with those obtained from a multi-zone model enables constraints to\nbe obtained on the direction of stellar motion with respect to the observer. \n\n"}

We analyze these instabilities in both a linear perturbation\nanalysis and a three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulation.

However, recent works have suggested the existence of an intermediate\npopulation in the bursts observed by the Swift satellite. Moreover, some\nresearchers have questioned the universality of the 2.0-second dividing line\nbetween short and long bursts: some bursts may be short but actually result\nfrom collapsars, the physical mechanism behind normally long bursts, and some\nlong ones may originate from mergers, the usual progenitors of short GRBs. In\nthis work, we focus on GRBs detected by the Fermi satellite and study the\ndistribution of their durations measured in the observer's reference frame and,\nfor those with known redshifts, in the bursts' reference frames. However, there\nare relatively few bursts with measured redshifts, and this makes an accurate\nstudy difficult. To overcome this problem, we follow [Zhang:2018] and determine\na \"pseudo-redshift\" from the correlation relation between the luminosity $L_p$\nand the energy $E_p$, both of which are calculated at the peak of the flux.\nInterestingly, we find that the uncertainties in the quantities observed and\nused in the determination of pseudo-redshifts, do affect the precision of the\nindividual results significantly, but they keep the distribution of\npseudo-redshifts very similar to that of the actual ones and thus allow us to\nuse pseudo-redshifts for our statistical study. We use the reduced chi-square\nand the maximization of the log-likelihood to statistically analyze the\ndistribution of Fermi GRB durations. Both methods show that the distribution of\nthe observed and the intrinsic bursts durations are better represented by two\ngroups, rather than three. \n\n"}

While radio bubbles inflated by AGN jets\ncould be dynamically supported by cosmic rays (CRs), the impact of CR-dominated\njets are not well understood. In this work, we perform three-dimensional\nsimulations of CR-jet feedback in an isolated cluster atmosphere; we find that\nCR jets impact the multiphase gas differently than jets dominated by kinetic\nenergy. In particular, CR bubbles can more efficiently uplift the cluster gas\nand cause an outward expansion of the hot ICM. Due to adiabatic cooling from\nthe expansion and less efficient heating from CR bubbles by direct mixing, the\nICM is more prone to local thermal instabilities, which will later enhance\nchaotic cold accretion onto the AGN. The amount of cold gas formed during the\nbubble formation and its late-time evolution sensitively depend on whether CR\ntransport processes are included or not.

In this situation, new insights into the burst mechanism could be gained\nby combining the temporal behavior of radio pulsations. We present a general\nmodel for radio suppression by relativistic $e^{\\pm}$ plasma outflows at the\nonset of magnetar flares. A sudden ejection of magnetic energy into the\nmagnetosphere would generate a fireball plasma, which is promptly driven to\nexpand at relativistic speed.

In particular, a TeV-scale\nslepton/squark can be resonantly produced through the interaction of the EeV\nneutrino with electrons/nucleons inside Earth, that decays to a light,\nlong-lived bino, which survives the propagation through Earth matter before\ndecaying back to neutrinos, leptons and/or quarks, thus producing upgoing air\nshowers in the atmosphere near ANITA.

Detections of gravitational waves from\nthese sources by LIGO and Virgo have garnered widespread media and public\nattention. Among these sources, precessing systems (with misaligned black-hole\nspin/orbital angular momentum) are of particular interest because of the rich\ndynamics they offer.

Visualizations of numerical simulations of precessing systems provide a\nmeans to understand and gain insights about these systems.

A set of realistic models of the equation of\nstate that yield an accurate description of the properties of finite nuclei and\nsupport neutron stars of two solar masses is used. Given that the tidal\npolarizability scales as the fifth power of the compactness parameter, a\nuniversal relation exists among the tidal polarizability and the compactness\nparameter that is highly insensitive to the underlying EOS.

Abstract: Mass accretion rate is a key parameter in accretion disk theory. It\ndetermines black hole accretion mode. In large scale cosmological simulations\nstudying galaxy formation and evolution, Bondi radius can at most be marginally\nresolved. In those simulations, Bondi accretion formula is always used to\nestimate black hole accretion rate. Bondi solution is too simple, which cannot\nrepresent the real accretion process. We perform simulations of hot accretion\nflow at parsec scale irradiated by a low luminosity active galactic nucleus\n(AGN). We perform 77 simulations with varying density and temperature at outer\nboundary (10 parsec). Our purpose is to find a formula to calculate real black\nhole accretion rate based on the gas density and temperature at parsec scale.\nWe define Eddington accretion rate to be $\\dot M_{\\rm Edd}=10L_{\\rm Edd}/c^2$,\nwith $L_{\\rm Edd}$ and $c$ been Eddington luminosity and speed of light\nrespectively. We set black hole mass to be $10^8M_{\\odot}$, $M_{\\odot}$ is\nsolar mass. We find that black hole accretion rate can be expressed as\n$\\frac{\\dot M_{\\rm BH} }{\\dot M_{\\rm Edd}}=10^{-3.11} (\\rho_0/10^{-22}{\\rm g\ncm}^{-3})^{1.36} (T_0/10^7 {\\rm K})^{-1.9}$, with $\\rho_0$ and $T_0$ being\ndensity and temperature at parsec scale, respectively.

This makes the KTN spacetime astrophysically relevant.\nIn this paper, we study properties of various circular orbits in the KTN\nspacetime, and find the locations of circular photon orbits (CPOs) and\ninnermost-stable-circular-orbits (ISCOs). Such orbits are important to\ninterpret the observed X-ray spectral and timing properties of accreting\ncollapsed objects, viz., black holes and naked singularities. Here we show that\nthe usual methods to find the ISCO radius do not work for certain cases in the\nKTN spacetime, and we propose alternate ways. For example, the ISCO equation\ndoes not give any positive real radius solution for particular combinations of\nKerr and NUT parameter values for KTN naked singularities. In such a case,\naccretion efficiency generally reaches $100\\%$ at a particular orbit of radius\n$r=r_0$, and hence we choose $r=r_0$ as the `ISCO' for practical purposes. \n\n"}

We constrain the\npressure anisotropy ($\\Delta p$) to lie within the stability bounds that would\nbe otherwise imposed by kinetic microinstabilities. We explore a broad region\nof parameter space by considering different Reynolds numbers and magnetic-field\nconfigurations, including net vertical flux, net toroidal-vertical flux and\nzero net flux. Remarkably, we find that the level of turbulence and\nangular-momentum transport are not greatly affected by large anisotropic\nviscosities: the Maxwell and Reynolds stresses do not differ much from the MHD\nresult. Angular-momentum transport in Braginskii MHD still depends strongly on\nisotropic dissipation, e.g., the isotropic magnetic Prandtl number, even when\nthe anisotropic viscosity is orders of magnitude larger than the isotropic\ndiffusivities. Braginskii viscosity nevertheless changes the flow structure,\nrearranging the turbulence to largely counter the parallel rate of strain from\nthe background shear. We also show that the volume-averaged pressure anisotropy\nand anisotropic viscous transport decrease with increasing isotropic Reynolds\nnumber (${\\rm Re}$); e.g., in simulations with net vertical field, the ratio of\nanisotropic to Maxwell stress ($\\alpha_{\\rm A} / \\alpha_{\\rm M}$) decreases\nfrom $\\sim 0.5$ to $\\sim 0.1$ as we move from ${\\rm Re} \\sim 10^3$ to ${\\rm Re}\n\\sim 10^4$.

We used\nPan-STARRS1 to follow-up five of these alerts during 2016-2017 to search for\nany optical transients that may be related to the neutrinos. Typically 10-20\nfaint ($m < 22.5$ mag) extragalactic transients are found within the\nPan-STARRS1 footprints and are generally consistent with being unrelated field\nsupernovae (SNe) and AGN. We looked for unusual properties of the detected\ntransients, such as temporal coincidence of explosion epoch with the IceCube\ntimestamp. We found only one transient that had properties worthy of a specific\nfollow-up. In the Pan-STARRS1 imaging for IceCube-160427A (probability to be of\nastrophysical origin of $\\sim$50 %), we found a SN PS16cgx, located at 10.0'\nfrom the nominal IceCube direction.
