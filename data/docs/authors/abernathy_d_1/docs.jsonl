This effect originates from the change of the\nshape of the vortex core due to non-equilibrium effects (similar to the\nmechanism of vortex motion instability in the Larkin-Ovchinnikov theory). The\nmoving vortex creates a deficit of quasiparticles in front of its motion and an\nexcess of quasiparticles behind the core of the moving vortex. This results in\nthe appearance of a wake (region with suppressed order parameter) behind the\nvortex which attracts other vortices resulting in an effective\ndirection-dependent interaction between vortices. When the vortex velocity $v$\nreaches the critical value $v_c$ quasi-phase slip lines (lines with fast vortex\nmotion) appear which may coexist with slowly moving vortices between such\nlines.

Depending on the field strength the superconductor is\neither in the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS), or in the\nFulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state of the Fulde-Ferrell (FF) type.\nThe strong correlations are accounted for by means of the Gutzwiller method\nwhat leads naturally to the emergence of the spin-dependent masses (SDM) of\nquasiparticles when the system is spin-polarized. The case without strong\ncorrelations (with the spin-independent masses, SIM) is analyzed for\ncomparison. We consider both the s-wave and the d-wave symmetries of the\nsuperconducting gap and concentrate on the parallel orientation of the Cooper\npair momentum Q with respect to the junction interface. The junction\nconductance is presented for selected barrier strengths (i.e., in the contact,\nintermediate, and tunneling limits). The conductance spectra in the cases with\nand without strong correlations differ essentially. Our analysis provides thus\nan experimentally accessible test for the presence of strong-correlations in\nthe superconducting state. Namely, correlations alter the distance between the\nconductance peaks (or related conductance features) for carriers with spin-up\nand spin-down. In the uncorrelated case, this distance is twice the Zeeman\nenergy.

The non-reciprocity of the device\nis controlled in-situ by varying the amplitude and phase difference of two\nindependent microwave pump tones feeding the system. At the desired working\npoint and for a signal frequency of 8.453 GHz, the device achieves a forward\npower gain of 15 dB within a dynamical bandwidth of 9 MHz, a reverse gain of -6\ndB and suppression of the reflected signal by 8 dB.

It can process up to 3 photons at the\nsignal frequency per inverse dynamical bandwidth.

It is noted that\nphysical systems being appropriately described by the TB model can exhibit the\nmain strongly correlated electron system (SCES) properties, when they are\nsolved in the HF approximation, by also allowing crystal symmetry breaking\neffects and non-collinear spin orientations of the HF orbitals. It is argued\nhow a simple 2D square lattice system of Coulomb interacting electrons can\nexhibit insulator gaps and pseudogap states, and quantum phase transitions as\nillustrated by the mentioned former works. A discussion is also presented here\nindicating the possibility of attaining room temperature superconductivity, by\nmeans of a surface coating with water molecules of cleaved planes of graphite,\nbeing orthogonal to its c-axis. The possibility that 2D arrays of quantum dots\ncan give rise to the same effect is also proposed to consideration. The\nanalysis also furnishes theoretical insight to solve the Mott-Slater debate, at\nleast for the La2CuO4 and TMO band structures. The idea is to apply a properly\nnon-collinear GW scheme to the electronic structure calculation of these\nmaterials. The fact is that the GW approach can be viewed as a HF procedure in\nwhich the screening polarization is also determined. This directly indicates\nthe possibility of predicting the assumed dielectric constant in the previous\nworks.

First, we\nexamine the phase diagrams of two-band systems with a passive band in which the\nintraband pairing interaction is absent and superconductivity is induced by a\nCooper pair tunneling from an active band. It is demonstrated that the\ntemperature of the Lifshitz point at which three second-order transition lines\nmeet is independent of the Cooper pair tunneling strength. The BCS-FFLO\ncritical field becomes lower than the Lifshitz point with increasing the\ninterband tunneling strength, and the resultant phase diagram is qualitatively\ndifferent from that in a single-band superconductor. We also study the\nthermodynamics of Pauli-limiting two-band superconductors with comparable\nintraband pairing interactions.

We construct exact quench phase diagrams\nthat predict the asymptotic state (including the many-body wavefunction)\ndepending on the initial and final detunings and on the Feshbach resonance\nwidth. Outside of the weak coupling regime, both the mechanism and the time\ndependence of the relaxation of the amplitude of the order parameter in phases\nI and II are modified. Also, quenches from arbitrarily weak initial to\nsufficiently strong final coupling do not produce persistent oscillations in\ncontrast to the behavior in the BCS regime. The most remarkable feature of\ncoherent condensate dynamics in various fermion superfluids is an effective\nreduction in the number of dynamic degrees of freedom as the evolution time\ngoes to infinity. As a result, the long time dynamics can be fully described in\nterms of just a few new collective dynamical variables governed by the same\nHamiltonian only with \"renormalized\" parameters. Combining this feature with\nthe integrability of the underlying (e.g. the two channel) model, we develop\nand consistently present a general method that explicitly obtains the exact\nasymptotic state of the system. \n\n"}

The Fermions acquire mass, $m_F\\equiv\\Delta$, where $\\Delta$ is the\nBCS gap. There are also 18 Bosonic excitations - 4 Nambu-Goldstone (NG) modes\nand 14 massive amplitude Higgs (AH) modes. The Bosonic modes are labelled by\nthe total angular momentum, $J\\in\\{0,1,2\\}$, and parity under particle-hole\nsymmetry, $C=\\pm 1$. For each pair of angular momentum quantum numbers,\n$J,J_z$, there are two Bosonic partners with $C=\\pm 1$. Based this spectrum\nNambu proposed a sum rule connecting the Fermion and Boson masses for BCS type\ntheories, which for $^3$He-B is $M_{J^+}^2 + M_{J^-}^2 = 4m_F^2$ for each\nfamily of Bosonic modes labelled by $J$, where $M_{J^C}$ is the mass of the\nBosonic mode with quantum numbers $(J,C)$. Nambu's sum rule (NSR) has recently\nbeen discussed in the context of Nambu-Jona-Lasinio models for physics beyond\nthe standard model to speculate on possible partners to the recently discovered\nHiggs Boson at higher energies. Here we point out that Nambu's Fermion-Boson\nmass relations are not exact. Corrections to the Bosonic masses from (i)\nleading order strong-coupling corrections to BCS theory, and (ii) polarization\nof the parent Fermionic vacuum lead to violations of the sum-rule.

First,\nalthough the charge density is concentrated on the triangular lattice sites of\nthe moir$\\text{\\'e }$ pattern, the Wannier states of the tight-binding model\nmust be centered on different sites which form a honeycomb lattice.

For large sizes ($L\\le 98$)\nthe behavior is similar: the low-energy d-wave order parameter $P_d$ is weakly\naffected by a couple of Lanczos iterations in the low doping $\\delta\\sim 10%$\nregion, whereas the energy is considerably lowered. As a further test of our\ncalculation we have computed the variance of the Hamiltonian $\\Delta E_p=(<\n\\hat{H}^2 >-< \\hat{H} >^2)/L^2$ on the BCS wavefunction with $p=0,1,2$ Lanczos\nsteps. For large $p$, when the Lanczos algorithm converges to the exact ground\nstate, the variance vanishes exponentially with increasing $p$. The remarkable\nreduction of the variance, observed for $p=1,2$ Lanczos steps even for the\nlargest lattice size considered, suggests a smooth and rapid convergence to the\nexact ground state. These results support the existence of off-diagonal\nlong-range d-wave superconducting order in the two-dimensional $t{-}J$ model. \n\n"}

We argue that in 2D, the\nsystem has two typical energies - an effective spin-fermion interaction $\\bar\ng$ and an energy $\\omega_{sf}$ below which the system behaves as a Fermi\nliquid. The ratio of the two determines the dimensionless coupling constant for\nspin-fermion interaction $\\lambda^2 \\propto {\\bar g}/\\omega_{sf}$. We show that\n$\\lambda$ scales with the spin correlation length and diverges at criticality.\nThis divergence implies that the conventional perturbative expansion breaks\ndown.

The influence of self-energy effects on the conductances is also\nconsidered using a model where the electrons interact with a dispersionless,\nlow-lying branch of bosons. We show that available tunneling spectra from\nbreak-junctions are best explained by assuming that they result from incoherent\ntunneling with a strongly anisotropic hopping matrix element of the form\nsuggested by band structure calculations. The conductance spectra are then\ncharacterized by one single peak which evolves continuously from the\nsuperconducting to the d-CDW state with decreasing doping. The intrinsic c-axis\ntunneling spectra are, on the other hand, best explained by coherent tunneling.\nCalculated spectra show at low temperatures two peaks due to SC and d-CDW. With\nincreasing temperature the BCS-like peak moves to zero voltage and vanishes at\nT$_c$,exactly as in experiment.Our results thus can explain why break junction\nand intrinsic tunneling spectra are different from each other.

Impurity-free La1.85Sr0.15CuO4 shows a spin gap of 4meV\nbelow Tc in the antiferromagnetic(AF) incommensurate spin excitation. In\nZn:y=0.004, the spin excitation shows a spin gap of 3meV below Tc. In\nZn:y=0.008 and Zn:y=0.011, however, the magnetic signals at 3meV decrease below\nTc and increase again at lower temperature, indicating an in-gap state. In\nZn:y=0.017, the low-energy spin state remains unchanged with decreasing\ntemperature, and elastic magnetic peaks appear below 20K then exponentially\nincrease. As for Ni:y=0.009 and Ni:y=0.018, the low-energy excitations below\n3meV and 2meV disappear below Tc.

Within this theory the puzzling physics of the\ncuprates is shown to be a behavior specific of their structure, within the\nregime of a Mott transition. The translational symmetry within the CuO_2 planes\nis disturbed by dynamical stripe-like inhomogeneities, which provide\nquasi-one-dimensional segments where the large-U scenario of separation between\nspin and charge is materialized. However, these charge carriers gain itineracy\nonly due to the coupling with electrons in the regions where spin and charge\nare inseparable. Consequently a two-component scenario is obtained of heavy and\nlight charge carriers, which are coupled through spin carriers.

We describe\nvortex solutions in the simplest model in this class, the gauged $SU(2)\\times\nU(1)_Y$ $\\sigma$-model with the chemical potential for hypercharge $Y$, in\nwhich the gauge symmetry is completely broken. It is shown that there are three\ntypes of topologically stable vortices in the model, connected either with\nphoton field or hypercharge gauge field, or with both of them. Explicit vortex\nsolutions are numerically found and their energy per unit length are\ncalculated. The relevance of these solutions for the gluonic phase in the dense\ntwo-flavor QCD is discussed. \n\n"}

The introduction of the inhomogeneous phases\nleads to disappearance of the strange intermediate temperature 2SC/g2SC and\nchanges the phase diagram of neutral dense quark matter significantly. \n\n"}

Such junctions can be fabricated exploiting (a) the d-wave order\nparameter symmetry of cuprate superconductors; (b) the spacial oscillations of\nthe order parameter in superconductor-insulator-ferromagnet-superconductor\nstructures with different thicknesses of ferromagnetic layer to produce 0 or\n$\\pi$ coupling or (c) the structure of the corresponding sine-Gordon equations\nand substituting the phase $\\pi$-discontinuities by the artificial current\ninjectors. We investigate analytically the possible ground states in such a\nsystem and show that there is a critical facet length $a_c$, which separates\nthe states with half-integer flux quanta (semifluxons) from the trivial ``flat\nphase state'' without magnetic flux. We analyze different branches of the\nbifurcation diagram, derive a system of transcendental equations which can be\neffectively solved to find the crossover distance $a_c$ (bifurcation point) and\npresent the solutions for different number of facets and the edge facets\nlength.
