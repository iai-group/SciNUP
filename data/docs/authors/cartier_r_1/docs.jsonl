We present ground-based photometric and spectroscopic\nmonitoring and adaptive-optics imaging of the OT, as well as pre- and\npost-outburst space-based imaging with HST and Spitzer. The optical spectrum at\nmaximum showed an F-type supergiant photosphere with superposed emission lines\nof hydrogen, Ca II, and [Ca II], similar to the spectra of low-luminosity Type\nIIn \"supernova impostors\" like SN 2008S, as well as cool hypergiants like IRC\n+10420. The emission lines have a complex, double structure, indicating a\nbipolar outflow with velocities of ~75 km/s. The luminous energy released in\nthe eruption was ~10^47 ergs, most of it emitted in the first 2 months.

The observations consist of\nnear-IR spectra in the H and K-bands, from SpeX on the IRTF and far-red spectra\n(6000 - 9000 A) from Hectospec on the MMT. These YSOs were identified in\nprevious Spitzer and Chandra observations, and the evolutionary classes of the\nYSOs were determined from the Spitzer mid-IR photometry. With these spectra, we\nsearch for corroborating evidence for the pre-main sequence nature of the\nobjects, study the properties of the detected emission lines as a function of\nevolutionary class, and obtain spectral types for the observed YSOs. By\ncomparing the positions of the YSOs in the HR diagrams with the pre-main\nsequence tracks of Baraffe (1998), we determine ages of the embedded sources\nand study the relative ages of the YSOs with and without optically thick\ncircumstellar disks. The apparent isochronal ages of the YSOs in both clusters\nrange from less than 1 Myr to 10 Myr, with most objects below 3 Myr. The\nobserved distribution of ages for the Class II and Class III objects are\nstatistically indistinguishable.

In this work we investigate\nwhether dwarf galaxy accretion is consistent with the radial profile of star\nformation observed in the Milky Way, which is strongly concentrated toward the\ncenter of the gaseous disk of the Galaxy. Using realistic parameters for the\nGalactic potential, gaseous halo, Galactic disk, velocities of dwarf galaxies,\nand effects of drag on stripped gas in the halo, we model the distribution of\nradii at which dwarf galaxies accrete onto the Galactic disk. We also model the\nradial distribution of the accretion of gas that cools directly out of the halo\nby examining the results of recent simulations. We show that dwarf galaxies\ncannot reproduce the concentration of accretion toward the center of the Galaxy\nrequired by star formation. We also show that clouds that cool directly from\nthe halo can reproduce this central concentration, and conclude that this\ndifference is largely due to the discrepancy in absolute specific angular\nmomentum between the two mechanisms. \n\n"}

Here, filaments that are still colder and denser than\nthe surrounding halo gas, are not able to connect directly to galaxies, as they\ndo at high redshift, but are instead susceptible to the combined action of\ncooling and Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities at intermediate radii within the halo\nleading to the production of cold, dense pressure-confined clouds, without an\nassociated dark matter component. This process is aided through the compression\nof the incoming filaments by the hot halo gas and expanding shocks during the\nhalo buildup.

The most\npowerful jets are thought to derive a significant fraction, if not the\nmajority, of their power from the rotational energy of the black hole. Whatever\nthe precise mechanism that causes them, these jets must therefore exert a\nbraking torque on the black hole. We calculate the spin-up function for an\naccreting black hole, accounting for this braking torque. We find that the\npredicted black hole spin-up function depends only on the black hole spin and\ndimensionless parameters describing the accretion flow. Using recent\nrelativistic magnetohydrodynamical numerical simulation results to calibrate\nthe efficiency of angular momentum transfer in the flow, we find that an ADAF\nflow will spin a black hole up (or down) to an equilibrium value of about 96%\nof the maximal spin value in the absence of jets. Combining our ADAF system\nwith a simple model for jet power, we demonstrate that an equilibrium is\nreached at approximately 93% of the maximal spin value, as found in the\nnumerical simulation studies of the spin-up of accreting black holes, at which\npoint the spin-up of the hole by accreted material is balanced by the braking\ntorque arising from jet production.

If superbradyons are present as free particles in our Universe, they\nare expected to couple very weakly to \"ordinary\" matter, but they can\nspontaneously decay by emitting standard particles until they reach a speed\nequal or close to that of light. They would then form a cosmological sea where\nthe relation between inertial and gravitational masses would differ from\nconventional Physics.

The aim of this work is to gain a better understanding of\nthe depth dependence and isotope-selective nature of this process.\n  Methods. We present a photodissociation model based on recent spectroscopic\ndata from the literature, which allows us to compute depth-dependent and\nisotope-selective photodissociation rates at higher accuracy than in previous\nwork. The model includes self-shielding, mutual shielding and shielding by\natomic and molecular hydrogen, and it is the first such model to include the\nrare isotopologues C17O and 13C17O. We couple it to a simple chemical network\nto analyse CO abundances in diffuse and translucent clouds, photon-dominated\nregions, and circumstellar disks.\n  Results. The photodissociation rate in the unattenuated interstellar\nradiation field is 2.6e-10 s^-1, 30% higher than currently adopted values.\nIncreasing the excitation temperature or the Doppler width can reduce the\nphotodissociation rates and the isotopic selectivity by as much as a factor of\nthree for temperatures above 100 K. The model reproduces column densities\nobserved towards diffuse clouds and PDRs, and it offers an explanation for both\nthe enhanced and the reduced N(12CO)/N(13CO) ratios seen in diffuse clouds. The\nphotodissociation of C17O and 13C17O shows almost exactly the same depth\ndependence as that of C18O and 13C18O, respectively, so 17O and 18O are equally\nfractionated with respect to 16O.

The\nsecond shows a completely different position angle (151.3+/-0.4) and displays a\nmild but statistically significant evolution between the two epochs. While the\nformer is identified as arising in the interstellar dust associated with\nNGC300, the latter is most likely due to continuum polarization by dust\nscattering in the circumstellar environment. No line depolarization is detected\nin correspondence of the most intense emission lines, disfavoring electron\nscattering as the source of intrinsic polarization. This implies a very small\ndeviation from symmetry in the continuum-forming region. Given the observed\nlevel of intrinsic polarization, the transient must be surrounded by a\nsignificant amount of dust (>4x10^-5 Msun), asymmetrically distributed within a\nfew thousand AU. This most likely implies that one or more asymmetric outflow\nepisodes took place during the past history of the progenitor. \n\n"}

The best-fit redshift\nevolution model is of the form f_SF ~ (1+z)^5.7, which is stronger redshift\nevolution than that of L*_IR in both clusters and the field. We find that,\nstatistically, this excess is associated with galaxies found at large\ncluster-centric radii, implying that the MIR Butcher-Oemler effect can be\nexplained by a combination of both the global decline in star-formation in the\nuniverse since z~1 and enhanced star formation in the infall regions of\nclusters at intermediate redshifts.

Until\nrecently, fewer than a half-dozen unobscured quasar sightlines suitable for the\nHeII Gunn-Peterson test were known; although these handful demonstrated great\npromise, the small sample size limited confidence in cosmological inferences.\nWe have recently added nine more such clean HeII quasars, exploiting SDSS\nquasar samples, broadband UV imaging from GALEX, and high-yield UV\nspectroscopic confirmations from HST.

This line is thought to be\nproduced by X-ray irradiation of the warm protoplanetary disk atmospheres,\nhowever the observational correlation between [Ne II] luminosities and measured\nX-ray luminosities shows a large scatter.

In\nthis work we explore the possibility that the large variations in the observed\n[Ne II] luminosity may be caused instead by different star-disk parameters. In\nparticular we study the effects that the hardness of the irradiating source and\nthe structure (flaring) of the disk have on the luminosity and spectral profile\nof the [Ne II] 12.8 micron line. We find that varying these parameter can\nindeed cause up to an order of magnitude variation in the emission luminosities\nwhich may explain the scatter observed, although our models predict somewhat\nsmaller luminosities than those recently reported by other authors who observed\nthe line with the Spitzer Space Telescope.

Abstract: Many young extra-galactic clusters have a measured velocity dispersion that\nis too high for the mass derived from their age and total luminosity, which has\nled to the suggestion that they are not in virial equilibrium. Most of these\nclusters are confined to a narrow age range centred around 10 Myr because of\nobservational constraints. At this age the cluster light is dominated by\nluminous evolved stars, such as red supergiants, with initial masses of ~13-22\nMsun for which (primordial) binarity is high. In this study we investigate to\nwhat extent the observed excess velocity dispersion is the result of the\norbital motions of binaries. We demonstrate that estimates for the dynamical\nmass of young star clusters, derived from the observed velocity dispersion,\nexceed the photometric mass by up-to a factor of 10 and are consistent with a\nconstant offset in the square of the velocity dispersion. This can be\nreproduced by models of virialised star clusters hosting a massive star\npopulation of which ~25 is in binaries, with typical mass ratios of ~0.6 and\nperiods of ~1000 days.

In this model optical\nhalf-light radii are smaller, both at fixed stellar mass and maximum circular\nvelocity, at higher redshifts. This model also predicts that the scaling\nrelations between baryonic quantities evolve even more weakly than the\ncorresponding stellar relations.

The\nkey ingredient is that an evolved primary increases its photospheric radius on\nrelatively short timescales, to a point where the radius is comparable to or\nlarger than the periastron separation in an eccentric binary. In such a\nconfiguration, a violent and sudden collision would ensue, possibly leading to\nsubstantial mass ejection instead of a binary merger. Repeated periastral\ngrazings in an eccentric system could quickly escalate to a catastrophic\nencounter, wherein the companion star actually plunges deep inside the\nphotosphere of a bloated primary during periastron, as a result of the primary\nstar increasing its own radius. This is motivated by the case of $\\eta$\nCarinae, where such a collision must have occured if conventional estimates of\nthe present-day orbit are correct, and where brief peaks in the light curve\ncoincide with periastron. Stellar collisions may explain brief recurring LBV\noutbursts like SN 2000ch and SN 2009ip, and perhaps outbursts from relatively\nlow-mass progenitor stars (collisons are not necessarily the exclusive domain\nof very luminous stars). Finally, mass ejections induced repeatedly at\nperiastron cause orbital evolution; this may explain the origin of very\neccentric colliding-wind Wolf-Rayet binaries such as WR140. \n\n"}

We find that it\nis a Type II-Plateau (II-P) SN which most closely resembles the low-luminosity\nSN 1999br in NGC 4900. Given the overall similarity between the observed light\ncurves and colors of SNe 2008bk and 1999br, we infer that the total visual\nextinction to SN 2008bk (A_V=0.065 mag) must be almost entirely due to the\nGalactic foreground, similar to what has been assumed for SN 1999br. We confirm\nthe identification of the putative red supergiant (RSG) progenitor star of the\nSN in high-quality g'r'i' images we had obtained in 2007 at the Gemini-South 8\nm telescope. Little ambiguity exists in this progenitor identification,\nqualifying it as the best example to date, next to the identification of the\nstar Sk -69 202 as the progenitor of SN 1987A. From a combination of photometry\nof the Gemini images with that of archival, pre-SN, Very Large Telescope JHK_s\nimages, we derive an accurate observed spectral energy distribution (SED) for\nthe progenitor. We find from nebular strong-intensity emission-line indices for\nseveral HII regions near the SN that the metallicity in the environment is\nlikely subsolar (Z~0.6 Z_Sun). The observed SED of the star agrees quite well\nwith synthetic SEDs obtained from model red supergiant atmospheres with\neffective temperature T_eff=3600+/-50 K.

This feature may be welcome and can rescue the situation if\nDirect Dark Matter experiments point towards small neutralino-nucleon cross\nsections, implying small neutralino annihilation rates and hence large relic\ndensities, at least in the popular supersymmetric scenarios. In the presence of\na diluting mechanism both experimental constraints can be met.

The recent optical observations of binary pulsar system PSR\nB1259-63/LS 2883 revealed radiation properties of the companion star which\ndiffer significantly from previous measurements.

We fit color-magnitude\ndiagrams (CMDs) with several different sets of theoretical isochrones, and\ndetermine systematic uncertainties for population parameters when derived using\nany one set of isochrones. The cluster CMDs show several interesting features,\nincluding extended main sequence turnoff (MSTO) regions, narrow red giant\nbranches, and clear sequences of unresolved binary stars. We show that the\nextended MSTOs are not caused by photometric uncertainties, contamination by\nfield stars, or the presence of binary stars. Enhanced helium abundances in a\nfraction of cluster stars are also ruled out as the reason for the extended\nMSTOs. Quantitative comparisons with simulations indicate that the MSTO regions\nare better described by a spread in ages than by a bimodal age distribution,\nalthough we can not formally rule out the latter for the three lowest-mass\nclusters in our sample (which have masses lower than about 3E4 solar masses).\nThis conclusion differs from that of some previous works which suggested that\nthe age distribution in massive clusters in our sample is bimodal. This\nsuggests that any secondary star formation occurred in an extended fashion\nrather than through short bursts. We discuss these results in the context of\nthe nature of multiple stellar populations in star clusters. \n\n"}

However, when\n$Z>0.02$, the carbon abundance is not only a function of the initial WD mass,\nbut also metallicity, i.e. for a given initial WD mass, the higher the\nmetallicity, the lower the carbon abundance.

The EGB can be fully explained as the sum of three\ndistinct components, namely blazars, non-beamed AGNs (Seyfert galaxies and\nQSOs), and cosmic rays from star-forming galaxies. The contribution to the\nbackground from beamed sources is obtained by fitting the Fermi-LAT blazar\ndifferential number counts assuming that the gamma-ray luminosity function is\ndirectly proportional to the radio luminosity function of FRI and FRII\ngalaxies. The high energy emission from non-beamed AGNs is instead determined\nby popular synthesis models of the observed X-ray background. Finally, the EGB\nis fit by adding a third component arising from pion decay in cosmic rays,\nassuming that such component is closely linked to the cosmic star formation\nhistory.

Its sensitivity to helium is linear over the entire\nmetallicity range, it is minimally affected by age, uncertainties in the\nphotometric zero-point, reddening or the effects of evolution on the horizontal\nbranch.

We compare the impact of both the magnetic field\nand the wind anisotropy to the benchmark case of a purely hydrodynamical (HD)\ninteraction of isotropic winds, which has been studied in detail by Bogovalov\net al.

We consider the interaction in axisymmetric approximation, i.e.\nthe pulsar rotation axis is assumed to be oriented along the line between the\npulsar and the optical star and the effects related to the pulsar orbiting are\nneglected. The impact of the magnetic field is studied for the case of weak\nmagnetization (with magnetization parameter $\\sigma<0.1$), which is consistent\nwith conventional models of pulsar winds.

Abstract: We explore the minimal conditions which enable the formation of\nmetal-enriched solar and sub-solar mass stars. We find that in the absence of\ndust grains, gas fragmentation occurs at densities nH ~ [10^4-10^5]cm^{-3} when\nthe metallicity exceeds Z ~ 10^{-4} Zsun. The resulting fragmentation masses\nare > 10 Msun. The inclusion of Fe and Si cooling does not affect the thermal\nevolution as this is dominated by molecular cooling even for metallicities as\nlarge as Z = 10^{-2} Zsun. The presence of dust is the key driver for the\nformation of low-mass stars. We focus on three representative core-collapse\nsupernova (SN) progenitors, and consider the effects of reverse shocks of\nincreasing strength: these reduce the depletion factors, fdep =\nMdust/(Mdust+Mmet), alter the shape of the grain size distribution function and\nmodify the relative abundances of grain species and of metal species in the gas\nphase. We find that the lowest metallicity at which fragmentation occurs is\nZ=10^{-6} Zsun for gas pre-enriched by the explosion of a 20 Msun primordial SN\n(fdep > 0.22) and/or by a 35 Msun, Z=10^{-4} Zsun SN (fdep > 0.26); it is ~ 1\ndex larger, when the gas is pre-enriched by a Z = 10^{-4} Zsun, 20 Msun SN\n(fdep > 0.04). Cloud fragmentation depends on the depletion factor and it is\nsuppressed when the reverse shock leads to a too large destruction of dust\ngrains. These features are all consistent with the existence of a minimum\ndust-to-gas ratio, Dcr, above which fragmentation is activated. We derive a\nsimple analytic expression for Dcr which, for grain composition and properties\nexplored in the present study, reads Dcr = [2.6 - 6.3] x 10^{-9}. When the\ndust-to-gas ratio of star forming clouds exceeds this value, the fragmentation\nmasses range between 0.01 Msun and 1 Msun, thus enabling the formation of the\nfirst low-mass stars. \n\n"}

The SN had a peak\nluminosity, M_R ~ -20.2 mag, significantly more luminous than known GRB-SNe and\none of the most luminous SNe Ib/c ever discovered. The absorption velocity of\nSN 2010ay is v_Si ~ 19,000 km/s at ~40 days after explosion, 2-5 times higher\nthan other broad-lined SNe and similar to the GRB-SN 2010bh at comparable\nepochs. Moreover, the velocity declines ~2 times slower than other SNe Ic-BL\nand GRB-SNe. Assuming that the optical emission is powered by radioactive\ndecay, the peak magnitude implies the synthesis of an unusually large mass of\n56 Ni, M_Ni = 0.9 M_solar.

Variations in the mean\nstrength of the solar magnetic field lead to significant shifts in the\nfrequencies of even the lowest-degree p modes with high levels of correlation\nwith surface activity proxies. These frequency shifts are explained to arise\nfrom structural changes in the outer layers of the Sun during the 11-year\nactivity cycle, which is understood to be driven by a dynamo process. However,\nclear differences between p-mode frequencies and surface activity during the\nextended minimum of cycle 23 were observed. The origin of the p-mode\nvariability is thus far from being properly understood and a better\ncomprehension of its relationship with solar and stellar activity cycles will\nhelp us in our understanding of the dynamo processes.

The phase\nstructure and gas mass at high densities are much more sensitive probes of\nstellar feedback physics than integrated quantities (Toomre Q or gas velocity\ndispersion).

SNe and stellar winds dominate the dynamics of volume-filling hot gas;\nhowever this primarily vents out of the disk. (3) The galaxy-averaged SFR is\ndetermined by feedback.

With these six LAEs, we revise our previous\nestimate of the number of faint LAEs in the Dressler et al. survey. Combining\nthese data with the density of bright LAEs in the Cosmic Origins Survey and\nSubaru Deep Field provides the best constraints to date on the redshift 5.7 LAE\nluminosity function (LF). Schechter function parameters, phi^* = 4.5 x 10^{-4}\nMpc^{-3}, L^* = 9.1 x 10^{42} erg s^{-1}, and alpha= -1.70, are estimated using\na maximum likelihood technique with a model for slit losses. To place this\nresult in the context of the UV-selected galaxy population, we investigate how\nvarious parameterizations of the Lyman Alpha equivalent width distribution,\nalong with the measured UV-continuum LF, affect shape and normalization of the\nLyman Alpha LF. The nominal model, which uses z~6 equivalent widths from the\nliterature, falls short of the observed space density of LAEs at the bright\nend, possibly indicating a need for higher equivalent widths. This\nparameterization of the equivalent width distribution implies that as many as\n50% of our faintest LAEs should have M_{UV} > -18.0, rendering them\nundetectable in even the deepest Hubble Space Telescope surveys at this\nredshift.

We use 9 highly spectroscopically complete radio samples, selected at\ndifferent frequencies and flux limits, to determine the efficiency of this\nmethod, and compare consistently observed correlations between alpha,\nluminosity, linear size, and redshift. We observe a weak correlation between z\nand alpha which remains even when Malmquist bias is removed. The strength of\nthis correlation depends on both the k-correction and sample selection\nfrequency, in addition to the frequency at which alpha is measured, and\nconsistent results for both high and low frequency selected samples are only\nseen if analysis is restricted to just extended radio galaxies. Many of the\nhighest redshift radio galaxies are very compact and often display a negatively\ncurved or peaked spectrum, and therefore the low-frequency radio spectrum as a\nwhole should be studied; this is something for which the LOFAR will be crucial.\nWe quantify both the efficiency and the completeness of various techniques used\nto select high-z radio galaxies. A steep-spectrum cut applied to low-frequency\nselected samples can more than double the fraction of high-z sources, but at a\ncost of excluding over half of the high-z sources present in the original\nsample.

We vary four parameters: the gas polytropic\nindex Gamma, its temperature at large radii T_xi, the DM logarithmic slope at\nlarge radii zeta and its concentration c_vir. When comparing the model to the\nobserved mass-temperature (M-T) relation of local clusters, our results are\nindependent of both T_xi and c_vir. We thus obtain constraints on Gamma, by\nfixing the DM profile, and on zeta, by fixing the gas profile. For an NFW DM\nprofile, we find that 6/5<Gamma<13/10, which is consistent with numerical\nsimulations and observations of individual clusters. Taking 6/5<Gamma<13/10\nallows the DM profile to be slightly steeper than the NFW profile at large\nradii. Upon including local groups, we constrain the mass-dependence of Gamma\nand the value of T_xi. Interestingly, with Gamma=6/5 and zeta=-3, we reproduce\nthe observed steepening/breaking of the M-T relation at low M, if 10^6\nK<T_xi<10^7 K, consistent with simulations and observations of the warm-hot\nintergalactic medium. When extrapolated to high redshift z, the model with a\nconstant Gamma reproduces the expected self-similar behaviour. We also account\nfor the observed, non-self-similar relations provided by some high-z clusters,\nas they provide constraints on the evolution of Gamma.

Theory suggests that rotating Wolf-Rayet stars are the best\ncandidates, but their strong stellar winds shroud their surfaces, preventing a\ndirect measurement of their rotation. Fortunately, linear spectropolarimetry\nmay be used to probe the flattening of their winds due to stellar spin.\nSpectropolarimetry surveys show that an 80% majority of WR stars have\nspherically symmetric winds and are thus rotating slowly, yet a small 20%\nminority display a spectropolarimetric signature indicative of rotation. Here\nwe find a highly significant correlation between WR objects that carry the\nsignature of stellar rotation and the subset of WR stars with ejecta nebulae\nthat have only recently transitioned from a red sugergiant or luminous blue\nvariable phase.

Identifying the\ndynamical nature of galaxies on a representative sample is necessary to infer\nand compare the mass assembly mechanisms across cosmic time. We present an\nanalysis of the kinematics properties of 50 galaxies with 0.9 < z < 1.6 from\nthe MASSIV sample observed with SINFONI/VLT with 4.5x10^9 Msun < M < 1.7x10^11\nMsun and 6 Msun/yr < SFR < 300 Msun/yr.

We find that 29% of galaxies\nare experiencing merging or have close companions that may be gravitationally\nlinked. This is placing a lower limit on the fraction of interacting galaxies.\nWe find that at least 44% of the galaxies display ordered rotation whereas at\nleast 35% are non-rotating objects. All rotators except one are compatible with\nrotation-dominated (Vmax/sigma > 1) systems. Non-rotating objects are mainly\nsmall objects (Re < 4 kpc).

The proportion of disks\nalso seems to be increasing in star-forming galaxies when the redshift\ndecreases. The number of interacting galaxies seems to be at a maximum at z ~\n1.2.

Dust formed in the ejecta then obscures the star.

The properties of these\nsources are broadly inconsistent with the predictions of the canonical model.\nThere are probably two classes of sources.

We study this issue in detail, particularly\nfocusing on the question: \"If future observations reveal nonzero curvature,\nwhat can we conclude?\" We find that whether an observable signal arises or not\ndepends crucially on three issues: the cosmic history just before the\nobservable inflation, the measure adopted to define probabilities, and the\nnature of the correlation between the tunneling and slow-roll parts of the\npotential.

To overcome the problems\nand/or to gain more insight, we develop a dynamical systems approach. A key\nassumption that goes into analysis is the chaotic hypothesis, which is a\nnatural generalization of the ergodic hypothesis to non-Hamiltonian systems.\nThe unfamiliar feature for gravitational systems is that the local phase space\ntrajectories can either reproduce or escape due to the presence of cosmological\nand black hole horizons. We argue that the effect of horizons can be studied\nusing dynamical systems and apply the so-called thermodynamic formalism to\nderive the equilibrium (or Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen) measure given by a variational\nprinciple. We show that the only physical measure is not the Liouville measure\n(i.e. no entropy problem), but the equilibrium measure (i.e. no measure\nproblem) defined over local trajectories (i.e. no problem of observables) and\nsupported on only infinite trajectories (i.e. no problem of initial\nconditions).

In this paper, we analytically\nstudy the effect of high magnetic field on relativistic cold electron, and\nhence its effect on the stability and the mass-radius relation of a magnetic\nwhite dwarf.

Motivated by this, we explore eta/s in black hole accretion flows, in\norder to understand if such exotic flows could be a natural site for the lowest\neta/s. Accretion flow plays an important role in black hole physics in\nidentifying the existence of the underlying black hole. This is a rotating\nshear flow with insignificant molecular viscosity, which could however have a\nsignificant turbulent viscosity, generating transport, heat and hence entropy\nin the flow. However, in presence of strong magnetic field, magnetic stresses\ncan help in transporting matter independent of viscosity, via celebrated\nBlandford-Payne mechanism. In such cases, energy and then entropy produces via\nOhmic dissipation. In addition, certain optically thin, hot, accretion flows,\nof temperature >~ 10^9K, may be favourable for nuclear burning which could\ngenerate/absorb huge energy, much higher than that in a star.

A lower bound on\neta/s also leads to an upper bound on the Reynolds number of the flow. \n\n"}

By comparing synthetic line profiles\nwith HST/STIS spectra obtained near apastron, we show that the WWC cavity has a\nstrong influence on multi-wavelength diagnostics. This influence is regulated\nby the modification of the optical depth in the continuum and spectral lines.\nWe find that H-alpha, H-beta, and Fe II lines are the most affected by the WWC\ncavity, since they form over a large volume of the primary wind. These spectral\nlines depend on latitude and azimuth since, according to the orientation of the\ncavity, different velocity regions of a spectral line are affected. For 2D\nmodels with orientation corresponding to orbital inclination angle 110deg < i <\n140deg and longitude of periastron 210deg < omega < 330deg, the blueshifted and\nzero-velocity regions of the line profiles are the most affected. These orbital\norientations are required to simultaneously fit the UV and optical spectrum of\nEta Car, for a half-opening angle of the cavity in the range 50-70deg. We find\nthat the excess P-Cygni absorption seen in H-alpha, H-beta and optical Fe II\nlines in spherical models becomes much weaker or absent in the 2D models, in\nagreement with the observations. The observed UV spectrum of Eta Car, dominated\nby Fe II absorption lines, is superbly reproduced by our 2D cavity models.\nSmall discrepancies still remain, as H-gamma and H-delta absorptions are\noverestimated by our models.

With enhanced mixing, our synthetic LCs start their post-breakout\nre-brightening phase earlier, follow a more gradual rise to peak, appear\nredder, and fade faster after peak due to enhanced gamma-ray escape.\nNon-thermal electrons, crucial for the production of HeI lines, deposit a\ndominant fraction of their energy as heat. Because energy deposition is\ngenerally local well after the LC peak, the broad HeI lines characteristic of\nmaximum-light SN IIb/Ib spectra require mixing that places 56Ni and helium\nnuclei to within a gamma-ray mean-free-path.

Excitation alone, which has been successfully\napplied for a handful of other GRBs, fails to describe the observed\ncolumn-density evolution in the case of GRB 080310.

The\nlarge population of ions in this latter level (up to 10% of all FeIII) can only\nbe explained through ionization of FeII, whereby a large fraction of the\nionized FeII ions -- we calculate 31% using the Flexible Atomic (FAC) and Cowan\ncodes -- initially populate the 7S3 level of FeIII rather than the ground\nstate. This channel for producing a significant FeIII 7S3 level population may\nbe relevant for other objects in which absorption lines from this level -- the\nUV34 triplet -- are observed, such as BAL quasars and Eta Carinae.

Statistically\nacceptable fits to the XRB spectrum at the 68% confidence level can be obtained\nfor CT fractions in the range 5-50%. This is because of degeneracies among\ninput parameters to the XRB synthesis code and uncertainties in the modeling of\nAGN spectra (e.g. reflection). The most promising route for constraining the\nfraction of CT AGN in the Universe is via the direct detection of those sources\nin high energy (>10keV) surveys. It is shown that the observed fraction of CT\nsources identified in the SWIFT/BAT survey, limits the intrinsic fraction of CT\nAGN, at least at low redshift, to 10-20% (68% confidence level). We also make\npredictions on the number density of CT sources that current and future X-ray\nmissions are expected to discover. Testing those predictions will constrain the\nintrinsic fraction of CT AGN as a function of redshift. \n\n"}

Comparing the measured cooling rates of\nthese stars with the expected values from theoretical models allows us to\nsearch for sources of additional cooling due to the emission of weakly\ninteracting particles. In this paper, we present an independent inference of\nthe mass of the axion using the recent determination of the evolutionary\ncooling rate of R548, the DAV class prototype.

Stellar cooling is the solely responsible of the\nrates of change of period with time ($\\dot\\Pi$) for the DAV class. Thus, the\ninclusion of axion emission in these sequences notably influences the\nevolutionary timescales, and also the expected pulsational properties of the\nDAV stars. This allows us to compare the theoretical $\\dot\\Pi$ values to the\ncorresponding empirical rate of change of period with time of R548 to discern\nthe presence of axion cooling.

SNe Iax are spectroscopically\nsimilar to SNe Ia, but have lower maximum-light velocities (2000 < |v| < 8000\nkm/s), typically lower peak magnitudes (-14.2 > M_V,peak > -18.9 mag), and most\nhave hot photospheres. Relative to SNe Ia, SNe Iax have low luminosities for\ntheir light-curve shape. There is a correlation between luminosity and\nlight-curve shape, similar to that of SNe Ia, but offset from that of SNe Ia\nand with larger scatter. Despite a host-galaxy morphology distribution that is\nhighly skewed to late-type galaxies without any SNe Iax discovered in\nelliptical galaxies, there are several indications that the progenitor stars\nare white dwarfs (WDs): evidence of C/O burning in their maximum-light spectra,\nlow ejecta masses, strong Fe lines in their late-time spectra, a lack of X-ray\ndetections, and deep limits on massive stars and star formation at the SN\nsites.

Taking a distance to the cloud of 415 pc rather than 259 pc, the\ndistribution of ages is shifted to lower values, in the 1-3 Myr range, with a\ntail up to 10 Myr. The mass distribution spans 0.2-1.2 Msun, with median mass\nof 0.7 Msun. The distribution of fractional disk luminosities in Serpens\nresembles that of the young Taurus Molecular Cloud, with most disks consistent\nwith optically thick, passively irradiated disks in a variety of disk\ngeometries (Ldisk/Lstar ~ 0.1). In contrast, the distributions for the older\nUpper Scorpius and Eta Chamaeleontis clusters are dominated by optically thin\nlower luminosity disks (Ldisk/Lstar ~ 0.02). This evolution in fractional disk\nluminosities is concurrent with that of disk fractions. The actively accreting\nand non-accreting stars (based on Ha data) in Serpens show very similar\ndistributions in fractional disk luminosities, differing only in the brighter\ntail dominated by strongly accreting stars. In contrast with a sample of Herbig\nAe/Be stars, the T Tauri stars in Serpens do not have a clear separation in\nfractional disk luminosities for different disk geometries: both flared and\nflat disks present wider, overlapping distributions. This result is consistent\nwith previous suggestions of a faster evolution for disks around Herbig Ae/Be\nstars. Furthermore, the results for the mineralogy of the dust in the disk\nsurface do not show any correlation to either stellar and disk characteristics\nor mean cluster age in the 1-10 Myr range probed here. A possible explanation\nfor the lack of correlation is that the processes affecting the dust within\ndisks have short timescales, happening repeatedly, making it difficult to\ndistinguish long lasting evolutionary effects.

We simulate the nearby\n(radius 250 pc) part of this population, corresponding to the closest ~35 000\nblack holes, using current best estimates of the mass distribution of stellar\nmass black holes combined with two models for the velocity distribution of\nstellar-mass IBH which bracket likely possibilities. We distribute this\npopulation of objects appropriately within the different phases of the ISM and\ncalculate the Bondi-Hoyle accretion rate, modified by a further dimensionless\nefficiency parameter \\lambda. Assuming a simple prescription for radiatively\ninefficient accretion at low Eddington ratios, we calculate the X-ray\nluminosity of these objects, and similarly estimate the radio luminosity from\nrelations found empirically for black holes accreting at low rates. The latter\nassumption depends crucially on whether or not the IBH accrete from the ISM in\na manner which is axisymmetric enough to produce jets. Comparing the predicted\nX-ray fluxes with limits from hard X-ray surveys, we conclude that either the\nBondi-Hoyle efficiency parameter \\lambda, is rather small (< 0.01), the\nvelocities of the IBH are rather high, or some combination of both.

The most attractive scenario for the origin of such a\nlarge scale field is the advection of the field by the gas in the accretion\ndisk from the interstellar medium or a companion star. However, it is realized\nthat outward diffusion of the accreted field is fast compared to the inward\naccretion velocity in a geometrically thin accretion disk if the value of the\nPrandtl number Pm is around unity. In this work, we revisit this problem\nconsidering the angular momentum of the disk is removed predominantly by the\nmagnetically driven outflows. The radial velocity of the disk is significantly\nincreased due to the presence of the outflows. Using a simplified model for the\nvertical disk structure, we find that even moderately weak fields can cause\nsufficient angular momentum loss via a magnetic wind to balance outward\ndiffusion. There are two equilibrium points, one at low field strengths\ncorresponding to a plasma-beta at the midplane of order several hundred, and\none for strong accreted fields, beta~1.

As an application, we analyze the stability of the tide in coalescing\nneutron star binaries to p-g mode coupling. We find that the equilibrium tide\nand dynamical tide are both p-g unstable at gravitational wave frequencies\nf_{gw} > 20 Hz and drive p-g pairs to significant energies on very short\ntimescales (much less than the orbital decay time). Resonant parametric\ncoupling to the tide is, by contrast, either stable or drives modes at a much\nsmaller rate.

Z_c is much smaller than the typical average metallicity, <Z>, and\nthus the mixing efficiency of the pristine gas in the interstellar medium plays\na crucial role in the transition from Pop III to normal star formation. The\nsmall critical value, Z_c, corresponds to the far left tail of the probability\ndistribution function (PDF) of the metallicity. Based on closure models for the\nPDF formulation of turbulent mixing, we derive equations for the fraction of\ngas, P, lying below Z_c, in compressible turbulence. Our simulation data shows\nthat the evolution of the fraction P can be well approximated by a generalized\nself-convolution model, which predicts dP/dt = -n/tau_con P (1-P^(1/n)), where\nn is a measure of the locality of the PDF convolution and the timescale tau_con\nis determined by the rate at which turbulence stretches the pollutants.

We focus on two different scenarios for\nannihilation in the early universe, namely annihilation mediated by (1) a light\nscalar or by (2) a light pseudo-scalar. As expected, both cases are highly\nconstrained. Nevertheless, we find that there persists potentially viable\nparameter space to accommodate either scenario. In the first, accidental\ncancellations in the couplings allow for a SM-like Higgs with a total width and\ninvisible branching fraction compatible with the observed Higgs boson.\nAlternatively, the second scenario can occur in regions featuring smaller\nbranching fractions of the SM-like Higgs to pairs of light scalars,\npseudoscalars, and neutralinos without cancellations. The strongest constraints\nin both cases come from rare meson decays and exotic decays of the SM-like\nHiggs boson into neutralinos and light, CP-even Higgs pairs. We outline the\nrelevant parameter space for both scenarios and comment on prospects for future\ndiscovery with various experiments. \n\n"}

The correct computation of SN Ia radiation is not exclusively a\nsolution to an \"opacity problem\", characterized by the treatment of a large\nnumber of lines. It is also key to treat important atomic processes\nconsistently. Besides handling line blanketing in non-LTE, we show that\nincluding forbidden line transitions of metals is increasingly important for\nthe temperature and ionization of the gas beyond maximum light. Non-thermal\nionization and excitation are also critical since they affect the color\nevolution and the Delta-M15 of our model. While impacting little the bolometric\nluminosity, a more complete treatment of decay routes leads to enhanced line\nblanketing, e.g., associated with 48Ti in the U and B bands. Overall, we find\nthat SN Ia radiation properties are influenced in a complicated way by the\natomic data we employ, so that obtaining converged results is a challenge. We\nnonetheless obtain a good match to the golden standard type Ia SN 2005cf in the\noptical and near-IR, from 5 to 60d after explosion, suggesting that assuming\nspherical symmetry is not detrimental to SN Ia radiative-transfer modeling at\nthese times.

Our sample spans the redshift range\n0.1 < z < 1.6 and is the first comprehensive host galaxy study of this specific\nsubclass of cosmic explosions. Combining the multi-band photometry and\nemission-line measurements, we determine the luminosities, stellar masses, star\nformation rates and metallicities. We find that as a whole, the hosts of SLSNe\nare a low-luminosity (<M_B> ~ -17.3 mag), low stellar mass (<M_*> ~ 2 x 10^8\nM_sun) population, with a high median specific star formation rate (<sSFR> ~ 2\nGyr^-1). The median metallicity of our spectroscopic sample is low, 12 +\nlog(O/H}) ~ 8.35 ~ 0.45 Z_sun, although at least one host galaxy has solar\nmetallicity.

Early-type (elliptical and lenticular) galaxies are\nnot as gas-poor as previously thought, and at least 40% of local early-type\ngalaxies are now known to contain molecular and/or atomic gas.

Molecular\nand atomic gas detection rates range from 10% to 34% in red sequence early-type\ngalaxies, depending on how the red sequence is defined, and from 50% to 70% in\nblue early-type galaxies. Notably, massive red sequence early-type galaxies\n(stellar masses > 5e10 Msun, derived from dynamical models) are found to have\nHI masses up to M(HI)/Mstar ~ 0.06 and H_2 masses up to M(H$_2$)/Mstar ~ 0.01.\nSome 20% of all massive early-type galaxies may have retained atomic and/or\nmolecular gas through their transition to the red sequence.

Consistent\nwith previous studies, the observed MIR emission for most SED types is higher\nthan expected from only the attenuated stellar emission. We fit the NUV-to-MIR\ncomposite SEDs by the Flexible Stellar Population Synthesis (SPS) models, which\ninclude both stellar and dust emission.

Here we extend these results to different distances from the\nGalactic center, looking for variations of observables that can be related to\non-going and future spectroscopic surveys. By separating the effects of\nkinematic heating and radial migration, we show that migration is much more\nimportant, even for the oldest and hottest stellar population. The\ndistributions of stellar birth guiding radii and final guiding radii\n(signifying contamination from migration and heating, respectively) widen with\nincreasing distance from the Galactic center. As a result, the slope in the\nage-metallicity relation flattens significantly at Galactic radii larger than\nsolar. The radial metallicity and [Mg/Fe] gradients in our model show\nsignificant variations with height above the plane due to changes in the\nmixture of stellar ages. An inversion in the radial metallicity gradient is\nfound from negative to weakly positive (at r<10 kpc), and from positive to\nnegative for the [Mg/Fe] gradient, with increasing distance from the disk\nplane.

The\naccretion regimes that allow growth of the WDs are usually calculated assuming\nconstant mass-transfer rates. However, it is possible that these systems are\ninfluenced by effects that cause the rate to fluctuate on various timescales.\nWe investigate how long-term mass-transfer variability affects accreting WDs\nsystems. We show that, if such variability is present, it expands the parameter\nspace of binaries where the WD can effectively increase its mass. Furthermore,\nwe find that the supernova type Ia (SNIa) rate is enhanced by a factor 2-2.5 to\na rate that is comparable with the lower limit of the observed rates. The\nchanges in the delay-time distribution allow for more SNIae in stellar\npopulations with ages of a few Gyr.

In many\ncases, such as regression using Gaussian processes, the covariance matrix is of\nthe form $C = \\sigma^2 I + K$, where $K$ is computed using a specified\ncovariance kernel which depends on the data and additional parameters\n(hyperparameters). The matrix $C$ is typically dense, causing standard direct\nmethods for inversion and determinant evaluation to require $\\mathcal O(n^3)$\nwork. This cost is prohibitive for large-scale modeling.

Here we investigate how the spin\nof the black hole remnant influences mass ejection on the thermal and viscous\ntimescales. We carry out two-dimensional, time-dependent hydrodynamic\nsimulations of merger remnant accretion disks including viscous angular\nmomentum transport and approximate neutrino self-irradiation. The gravity of\nthe spinning black hole is included via a pseudo-Newtonian potential. We find\nthat a disk around a spinning black hole ejects more mass, up to a factor of\nseveral, relative to the non-spinning case. The enhanced mass loss is due to\nenergy release by accretion occurring deeper in the gravitational potential,\nraising the disk temperature and hence the rate of viscous heating in regions\nwhere neutrino cooling is ineffective. The mean electron fraction of the\noutflow increases moderately with BH spin due to a highly-irradiated (though\nnot neutrino-driven) wind component.

We investigate the\nrole of internal gravity waves in angular momentum transport in evolving low\nmass stars. In agreement with previous results, we find that convectively\nexcited gravity waves can prevent the development of strong differential\nrotation in the radiative cores of Sun-like stars. As stars evolve into\nsub-giants, however, low frequency gravity waves become strongly attenuated and\ncannot propagate below the hydrogen burning shell, allowing the spin of the\ncore to decouple from the convective envelope. This decoupling occurs at the\nbase of the sub-giant branch when stars have surface temperatures of roughly\n5500 K. However, gravity waves can still spin down the upper radiative region,\nimplying that the observed differential rotation is likely confined to the deep\ncore near the hydrogen burning shell. The torque on the upper radiative region\nmay also prevent the core from accreting high-angular momentum material and\nslow the rate of core spin-up.

This effect allows\nthe observed IR light curves to be used as a constraint on the position/size\nand the amount of CS dust. The method was applied to observed near-infrared\n(NIR) SN Ia samples; meaningful upper limits on the CS dust mass were derived\neven under conservative assumptions. We thereby clarify a difficulty associated\nwith the CS dust scattering model as a general explanation for the peculiar\nreddening law, while it may still apply to a sub-sample of highly reddened SNe\nIa. For SNe Ia in general, the environment at the interstellar scale appears to\nbe responsible for the non-standard extinction law. Furthermore, deeper limits\ncan be obtained using the standard nature of SN Ia NIR light curves. In this\napplication, an upper limit of Mdot ~10^{-8}-10^{-7} Msun/yr (for the wind\nvelocity of ~10 km/s) is obtained for a mass loss rate from a progenitor up to\n~0.01 pc, and Mdot ~10^{-7}-10^{-6} Msun/yr up to ~0.1 pc. \n\n"}

We tackle these issues by\nperforming Monte Carlo simulations of radiation-matter interactions in a\nscattering dominated photon-lepton plasma. The plasma -- initially in\nequilibrium -- is driven to non-equilibrium conditions by a sudden energy\ninjection in the lepton population, mimicking the effect of a shock wave or the\ndissipation of magnetic energy. Equilibrium restoration occurs due to energy\nexchange between the photons and leptons. While the initial and final\nequilibrium spectra are thermal, the transitional photon spectra are\ncharacterized by non-thermal features such as power-law tails, high energy\nbumps, and multiple components.

These orbits have forced eccentric motion aligned\nwith the binary as well as higher frequency oscillations, yet they do not\ncross, even in the presence of massive disks and perturbations from large\nplanets. For this reason, dissipative gas and planetesimals can settle onto\nthese \"most circular\" orbits, facilitating the growth of protoplanets.

This is mainly for two reasons. One relies on the gravitational\npotential of a moving lens being time-dependent (the $\\text{Moving}$\n$\\text{Cluster}$ $\\text{Effect}$, $\\text{MCE}$). The other is due to uneven\nmagnification across the extended, rotating source (the $\\text{Differential}$\n$\\text{Magnification}$ $\\text{Effect}$, $\\text{DME}$). The time delay between\nthe images can also cause their redshifts to differ because of cosmological\nexpansion. This Differential Expansion Effect is likely to be small.

This velocity can\nbe estimated with complicated hydrodynamic models. Uncertainties with such\nmodels can be avoided using the MCE.

Fortunately, we find that if detailed spectral\nline profiles were available, then the DME and MCE could be distinguished.

Recent observations suggest that\nthis galaxy hosts an actively accreting black hole with mass ~10^6 M_sun. The\npresence of an AGN in a low-mass starburst galaxy marks a new environment for\nactive galactic nuclei (AGNs), with implications for the processes by which\n\"seed\" black holes may form in the early Universe. In this paper, we analyze\nfour epochs of X-ray observations of Henize 2-10, to characterize the long-term\nbehavior of its hard nuclear emission.

If a star explodes in a binary system, the early supernova light curve\ncan be brightened by the collision of the supernova ejecta with the companion\nstar. The early brightening can be observed when the observer is in the\ndirection of the hole created by the collision. Based on a population synthesis\nmodel, we estimate the fractions of core-collapse supernovae in which the\nlight-curve brightening by the collision can be observed. We find that 0.19% of\ncore-collapse supernova light curves can be observed with the collisional\nbrightening. Type Ibc supernova light curves are more likely to be brightened\nby the collision (0.53%) because of the high fraction of the progenitors being\nin binary systems and their proximity to the companion stars.

The axion potential changes significantly during the level crossing,\nwhich affects the axion dynamics in various ways. We find that, if there is a\nmild hierarchy in the decay constants, the axion starts to run along the valley\nof the potential, passing through many crests and troughs, until it gets\ntrapped in one of the minima; the {\\it axion roulette}. The axion dynamics\nexhibits a chaotic behavior during the oscillations, and which minimum the\naxion is finally stabilized is highly sensitive to the initial misalignment\nangle.

The progenitors are\nselected using abundance matching techniques to account for the mass growth.\nThe morphologies strongly evolve from z~3. At z<1, the population matches the\nmassive end of the Hubble sequence, with 30% of spheroids, 50% of galaxies with\nequally dominant disk and bulge components and 20% of disks. At z~2-3 there is\na majority of irregular systems (~60-70%) with still 30% of spheroids.\n  We then analyze the SFRs, gas fractions and structural properties for the\ndifferent morphologies independently. Our results suggest two distinct channels\nfor the growth of bulges in massive galaxies.\n  Around 30-40% were already bulges at z~2.5, with low average SFRs and\ngas-fractions (10-15%), high Sersic indices (n>3-4) and small effective radii\n($R_e$~1 kpc) pointing towards an early formation through gas-rich mergers or\nVDI. Between z~ 2.5 and z~0, they rapidly increase their size by a factor of\n~4-5, become all passive but their global morphology remains unaltered. The\nstructural evolution is independent of the gas fractions, suggesting that it is\ndriven by ex-situ events.\n  The remaining 60% experience a gradual morphological transformation, from\nclumpy disks to more regular bulge+disks systems, essentially happening at z>1.\nIt results in the growth of a significant bulge component (n~3) for 2/3 of the\nsystems possibly through the migration of clumps while the remaining 1/3 keeps\na rather small bulge (n~1.5-2). The transition phase between disturbed and\nrelaxed systems and the emergence of the bulge is correlated with a decrease of\nthe star formation activity and the gas fractions. The growth of the effective\nradii scales roughly with $H(z)^{-1}$ and it is therefore consistent with the\nexpected growth of disks in galaxy haloes. \n\n"}

The spectra\nchanged in shape and flux with the phase. As periastron approached, the column\ndensity of the low-energy absorption increased, which indicates that the\nemission from the wind-wind collision plasma was absorbed by the dense W-R\nwind.

Much effort has gone into\ncomputing \"self force\" corrections to this motion, arising from the small\nbody's own contributions to the system's spacetime. Another correction to the\nmotion arises from coupling of the small body's spin to the black hole's\nspacetime curvature. Spin-curvature coupling drives a precession of the small\nbody, and introduces a \"force\" (relative to the geodesic) which shifts the\nsmall body's worldline. These effects scale with the small body's spin at\nleading order. In this paper, we show that the equations which govern\nspin-curvature coupling can be analyzed with a frequency-domain decomposition,\nat least to leading order in the small body's spin. We show how to compute the\nfrequency of precession along generic orbits, and how to describe the small\nbody's precession and motion in the frequency domain. We illustrate this\napproach with a number of examples. This approach is likely to be useful for\nunderstanding spin coupling effects in the extreme mass ratio limit, and may\nprovide insight into modeling spin effects in the strong field for non-extreme\nmass ratios. \n\n"}

We find that, on\naverage, these satellites tend to be located on the galactic plane of the\ncentral object. This effect is detected for central galaxies with a stellar\nmass larger than 10^10 solar masses and found to be strongest for red passive\ngalaxies, while blue galaxies exhibit a weaker trend. For galaxies with a minor\naxis parallel to the direction of the nearest filament, we find that the\ncoplanarity is stronger in the vicinity of the central galaxy, and decreases\nwhen moving towards the outskirts of the host halo. By contrast, the spatial\ndistribution of satellite galaxies relative to their closest filament follows\nthe opposite trend: their tendency to align with them dominates at large\ndistances from the central galaxy, and fades away in its vicinity. Relying on\nmock catalogs of galaxies in that redshift range, we show that massive red\ncentrals with a spin perpendicular to their filament also have corotating\nsatellites well aligned with both the galactic plane and the filament. On the\nother hand, lower-mass blue centrals with a spin parallel to their filament\nhave satellites flowing straight along this filament, and hence orthogonally to\ntheir galactic plane.

The gas surface density near the integral-shaped filament (ISF) is\nwell represented by a power law, Sigma(b)=72 Msun/pc^2(b/pc)^{-5/8} for our\nentire range, 0.05<b/pc<8.5, of distance from the filament ridge. Essentially\nall protostars lie on the ISF or other filament ridges, while almost all\npre-main-sequence stars do not. Combined with the fact that protostars move <1\nkms relative to the filaments while stars move several times faster, this\nimplies that protostellar accretion is terminated by a slingshot ejection from\nthe filaments. The ISF is the 3rd in a series of star bursts that are\nprogressively moving south, with separations of a few Myr in time and 3 pc in\nspace. This, combined with the filament's observed undulations (spatial and\nvelocity), suggests that repeated propagation of transverse waves thru the\nfilament is progressively digesting the material that formerly connected Orion\nA and B into stars in discrete episodes. We construct an axially symmetric gas\ndensity profile rho(r)=16 Msun/pc^3(r/pc)^{-13/8}. The model implies that the\nobserved magnetic fields are supercritical on scales of the observed\nundulations, suggesting that the filament's transverse waves are magnetically\ninduced. Because the magnetic fields are subcritical on scales of the filament\non larger scales, the system as a whole is relatively stable and long lived.\nProtostellar ejection occurs because the gas accelerates away from the\nprotostars, not the other way around. The model also implies that the ISF is\nkinematically young, which is consistent with other lines of evidence.

The sample galaxies are\nchosen to trace the distributions of star-forming galaxies in diagrams of\nstellar mass-star formation rate and stellar mass-metallicity.

Molecular gas masses and its\nfractions (molecular gas mass/(molecular gas mass + stellar mass)) for the\ndetected galaxies are in the ranges of (3.9-12) x 10^{10} Msun and 0.25-0.94,\nrespectively; these values are significantly larger than those in local spiral\ngalaxies. The molecular gas mass fraction decreases with increasing stellar\nmass; the relation holds for four times lower stellar mass than that covered in\nprevious studies, and that the molecular gas mass fraction decreases with\nincreasing metallicity.

Assuming a power law spectrum of fluctuations with maximal and minimal\ncutoff scales, we derive the velocity dispersion imparted to the halo particles\nand the relevant relaxation time. We further perform numerical simulations,\nwith fluctuations realised as a Gaussian random field, which confirm the\nformation of a core within a timescale comparable to that derived analytically.\nNon-radial collective modes enhance the energy transport process that erases\nthe cusp, though the parametrisations of the analytical model persist.\n  In our model, the dominant contribution to the dynamical coupling driving the\ncusp-core transformation comes from the largest scale fluctuations.

An important systematic\nconcern for these surveys is line confusion from foreground or background\ngalaxies emitting in other lines that happen to lie at the same observed\nfrequency as the \"target\" emission line of interest. We develop an approach to\nseparate this \"interloper\" emission at the power spectrum level. If one adopts\nthe redshift of the target emission line in mapping from observed frequency and\nangle on the sky to co-moving units, the interloper emission is mapped to the\nwrong co-moving coordinates. Since the mapping is different in the line of\nsight and transverse directions, the interloper contribution to the power\nspectrum becomes anisotropic, especially if the interloper and target emission\nare at widely separated redshifts. This distortion is analogous to the\nAlcock-Paczynski test, but here the warping arises from assuming the wrong\nredshift rather than an incorrect cosmological model. We apply this to the case\nof a hypothetical [CII] emission survey at z~7 and find that the distinctive\ninterloper anisotropy can, in principle, be used to separate strong foreground\nCO emission fluctuations. In our models, however, a significantly more\nsensitive instrument than currently planned is required, although there are\nlarge uncertainties in forecasting the high redshift [CII] emission signal.\nWith upcoming surveys, it may nevertheless be useful to apply this approach\nafter first masking pixels suspected of containing strong interloper\ncontamination. \n\n"}

To understand the origin of this deficit, and\nto investigate possible evolution with redshift and galaxy properties, we\nmeasure the SFR efficiency of atomic gas at z~1, z~2, and z~3 around\nstar-forming galaxies.

Stellar populations are the building blocks of galaxies including\nthe Milky Way. The majority, if not all extragalactic studies are entangled\nwith the use of stellar population models given the unresolved nature of their\nobservation. Extragalactic systems contain multiple stellar populations with\ncomplex star formation histories. However, their study is mainly based upon the\nprinciples of simple stellar populations (SSP). Hence, it is critical to\nexamine the validity of SSP models. AIMS. This work aims to empirically test\nthe validity of SSP models. This is done by comparing SSP models against\nobservations of spatially resolved young stellar population in the\ndetermination of its physical properties, i.e. age and metallicity. METHODS.\nIntegral field spectroscopy of a young stellar cluster in the Milky Way, NGC\n3603, is used to study the properties of the cluster both as a resolved and\nunresolved stellar population. The unresolved stellar population is analysed\nusing the H$\\alpha$ equivalent width as an age indicator, and the ratio of\nstrong emission lines to infer metallicity. In addition, spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) fitting using STARLIGHT, is used to infer these properties\nfrom the integrated spectrum. Independently, the resolved stellar population is\nanalysed using the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) for age and metallicity\ndetermination. As the SSP model represents the unresolved stellar population,\nthe derived age and metallicity are put to test whether they agree with those\nderived from resolved stars. RESULTS. The age and metallicity estimate of NGC\n3603 derived from integrated spectroscopy are confirmed to be within the range\nof those derived from the CMD of the resolved stellar population, including\nother estimates found in the literature.

The simplest and most obvious UV complete model\nthat incorporates such signals is that it arises from a new singlet scalar (or\npseudo-scalar) coupled to a new electrically charged and colored heavy fermion.\nHere we show that these new fermions (and anti-fermions) would be produced in\nthe early universe, then form new color singlet heavy mesons with light quarks,\nobtain a non-negligible freeze-out abundance, and remain in kinetic equilibrium\nuntil decoupling. These heavy mesons possess interesting phenomenology,\ndependent on their charge, including forming new bound states with electrons\nand protons.

However, there are few questions which needs detail\ninvestigation. (i) Does the complete (or part of) ICME shock or MC contribute\nin cosmic ray decrease?

In the simulation, stars\nolder than 6 Gyr were formed in a chaotic, bursty mode and have the largest\nvertical scale heights (1.5-2.5 kpc) by z=0, while stars younger than 6 Gyr\nwere formed in a relatively calm, stable disk. The vertical scale height\nincreases with stellar age at all radii, because (1) stars that formed earlier\nwere thicker \"at birth\", and (2) stars were kinematically heated to an even\nthicker distribution after formation. Stars of the same age are thicker in the\nouter disk than in the inner disk (flaring). These lead to positive vertical\nage gradients and negative radial age gradients. The radial metallicity\ngradient is neg- ative at the mid-plane, flattens at larger disk height |Z|,\nand turns positive above |Z|~1.5kpc.

The leading hypothesis is that such a supernova is a\nthermonuclear explosion of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf, but the exact explosion\nmechanism is still a matter of debate. Observation of a galactic SN Ia would be\nof immense value in answering the many open questions related to these events.\nOne potentially useful source of information about the explosion mechanism and\nprogenitor is the neutrino signal.\n  In this paper we compute the expected neutrino signal from a gravitationally\nconfined detonation (GCD) explosion scenario for a SN~Ia and show how the flux\nat Earth contains features in time and energy unique to this scenario.

The strongest\nand most robust result we find is that the luminosities of all spectral\nfeatures (except those of helium) tend to be higher in objects with steeper\nlate-time V-band decline rates.

The first compelling evidence for the\nacceleration came in the late 1990's, when two independent teams studying type\nIa supernovae discovered that distant SNe Ia were dimmer than expected. The\ncombined analysis of modern cosmology experiments, including SNe Ia, the Hubble\nconstant, baryon acoustic oscillations, and the cosmic microwave background has\nnow measured the contributions of matter and the cosmological constant to the\nenergy density of the universe to better than 0.01, providing a secure\nmeasurement of acceleration. A recent study (Tr{\\o}st Nielsen et al. 2015) has\nclaimed that the evidence for acceleration from SNe Ia is \"marginal.\" Here we\ndemonstrate errors in that analysis which reduce the acceleration significance\nfrom SNe Ia, and further demonstrate that conservative constraints on the\ncurvature or matter density of the universe increase the significance even\nmore. Analyzing the Joint Light-curve Analysis supernova sample, we find\n4.2{\\sigma} evidence for acceleration with SNe Ia alone, and 11.2{\\sigma} in a\nflat universe. With our improved supernova analysis and by not rejecting all\nother cosmological constraints, we find that acceleration is quite secure. \n\n"}

Based on previous studies of ears in\nCCSNRs and the similarity of some ears to those found in planetary nebulae, we\nassume that the ears are inflated by jets that are launched during the\nexplosion, or a short time after it. Under simple geometrical assumptions we\nfind that the extra kinetic energy of the ears is in the range of 1 to 10\npercents of the explosion energy. As not all of the kinetic energy of the jets\nends in the ears, we estimate that the typical kinetic energy in the jets that\ninflated the ears, under our assumptions, is about 5 to 15 percents of the\nexplosion energy.

This is in part due to a lack of reliable oxygen abundance indicators in\nthe metal-poor stars, in part due to shortcomings in 1D LTE abundance analyses.\nIn this study we determined the oxygen abundance in the metal-poor halo giant\nHD 122563 using a 3D hydrodynamical CO5BOLD model atmosphere. Our main goal was\nto understand whether a 3D LTE analysis may help to improve the reliability of\noxygen abundances determined from OH UV lines in comparison to those obtained\nusing standard 1D LTE methodology. The oxygen abundance in HD 122563 was\ndetermined using 71 OH UV lines located in the wavelength range between 308-330\nnm. The analysis was done using a high-resolution VLT UVES spectrum with a 1D\nLTE spectral line synthesis performed using the SYNTHE package and classical\nATLAS9 model atmosphere. Subsequently, a 3D hydrodynamical CO5BOLD, and 1D\nhydrostatic LHD model atmospheres were used in order to compute 3D-1D abundance\ncorrections. For this, the microturbulence velocity used with the 1D LHD model\natmosphere was derived from the hydrodynamical CO5BOLD model atmosphere. As in\nprevious studies, we found trends of the 1D LTE oxygen abundances determined\nfrom OH UV lines with line parameters, such as the line excitation potential\nand the line strength. These trends become significantly less pronounced in 3D\nLTE. Using OH UV lines we determined a 3D LTE oxygen abundance in HD 122563 of\nA(O) = 6.23 +/- 0.13.

Although somewhat too luminous and\nenergetic, this model reproduces satisfactorily the multi-band light curves and\nmulti-epoch spectra of SN 2008bk, confirming the suitability of a low-mass\nmassive star progenitor. As in other low-luminosity SNe II, the structured\nHalpha profile at the end of the plateau phase is probably caused by BaII\n6496.9A rather than asphericity.

It does not apply to the few-, or many-body problem; so, it\ncannot give, e.g., the two-body force between two galaxies, or be used to\nconduct N-body calculations of galaxy formation, evolution, and interactions.\nThe formula cannot be applied to the internal dynamics of a system embedded in\nan external field, where MOND predicts important consequences. etc. MOND is\nbacked by full-fledged, Lagrangian theories that can be, and are, routinely\napplied to all the above phenomena, and more. Verlinde's formula, as it now\nstands, strongly conflicts with solar-system and possibly earth-surface\nconstraints, and cannot fully account for the mass anomalies in the cores of\ngalaxy clusters (a standing conundrum in MOND). The recent weak-lensing test of\nthe formula is, in fact, testing a cornerstone prediction of MOND, one that the\nformula does reproduce, and which has been tested before in the very same way. \n\n"}

In\nthis paper, we present stellar parameters from K and M dwarfs hosting\ntransiting planet candidates discovered by our team. Using the SOFI\nspectrograph on the European Southern Observatory's New Technology Telescope,\nwe obtained R ~ 1000 J-, H-, and K-band (0.95 - 2.52 microns) spectra of 34\nlate-type K2 planet and candidate planet host systems and 12 bright K4-M5\ndwarfs with interferometrically measured radii and effective temperatures. Out\nof our 34 late-type K2 targets, we identify 27 of these stars as M dwarfs. We\nmeasure equivalent widths of spectral features, derive calibration relations\nusing stars with interferometric measurements, and estimate stellar radii,\neffective temperatures, masses, and luminosities for the K2 planet hosts. Our\ncalibrations provide radii and temperatures with median uncertainties of 0.059\nR_sun (16.09%) and 160 K (4.33%), respectively. We then reassess the radii and\nequilibrium temperatures of known and candidate planets based on our\nspectroscopically derived stellar parameters. Since a planet's radius and\nequilibrium temperature depends on the parameters of its host star, our study\nprovides more precise planetary parameters for planets and candidates orbiting\nlate-type stars observed with K2. We find a median planet radius and an\nequilibrium temperature of approximately 3R_earth and 500 K, with several\nsystems (K2-18b and K2-72e) receiving near-Earth like levels of incident\nirradiation. \n\n"}

Whether\nresulting EM emission is detectable is uncertain. The optical depth through the\ndisk is likely to be high enough that the prompt emission consists only of\nphotons from its optically thin skin, while the majority may take years to\nemerge. However, if some mechanism can release more photons in a time\ncomparable to the few-hour energy production time, the peak luminosity of the\nEM signal could be detectable.

Methods. This study is based on imaging spectroscopy with the\nG\\\"ottingen Fabry-P\\'erot Interferometer at the Vacuum Tower Telescope, on 2008\nAugust 7. Cloud model (CM) inversions of line scans in the strong chromospheric\nabsorption H$\\alpha$ line yielded CM parameters, which describe the cool plasma\ncontained in the arch filament system. Results. The observations cover the\ndecay and convergence of two micro-pores with diameters of less than one\narcsecond and provide decay rates for intensity and area. The photospheric\nhorizontal flow speed is suppressed near the two micro-pores indicating that\nthe magnetic field is sufficiently strong to affect the convective energy\ntransport. The micro-pores are accompanied by an arch filament system, where\nsmall-scale loops connect two regions with H$\\alpha$ line-core brightenings\ncontaining an emerging flux region with opposite polarities. The chromospheric\nvelocity of the cloud material is predominantly directed downwards near the\nfootpoints of the loops with velocities of up to 12 km/s, whereas loop tops\nshow upward motions of about 3 km/s.

Their lower ejecta density compared to\n$M_{\\rm Ch}$ models results in a more rapid increase of the luminosity at early\ntimes and an enhanced $\\gamma$-ray escape fraction past maximum light.\nConsequently, their bolometric light curves display shorter rise times and\nlarger post-maximum decline rates.

For sub-$M_{\\rm Ch}$ models fainter\nthan $M_B\\approx -18.5$ mag at peak, the greater bolometric decline and faster\ncolour evolution lead to a larger $B$-band post-maximum decline rate, $\\Delta\nM_{15}(B)$.

In this paper we consider the\nconstraints on both meanings of dark radiation based upon the newest results\nfor light-element nuclear reaction rates, observed light-element abundances and\nthe power spectrum of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Adding dark\nradiation during big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) alters the Friedmann expansion\nrate causing the nuclear reactions to freeze out at a different temperature.\nThis changes the final light element abundances at the end of BBN. Its\ninfluence on the CMB is to change the effective expansion rate at the surface\nof last scattering.

Besides using the angular momentum of the 15 solar-mass model\nas obtained in the stellar evolution calculation with an angular frequency of\nabout 0.001 rad/s (spin period of more than 6000 s) at the Si/Si-O interface,\nwe also computed 2D and 3D cases with no rotation and with a ~300 times shorter\nrotation period and different angular resolutions. In 2D, only the nonrotating\nand slowly rotating models explode, while rapid rotation prevents an explosion\nwithin 500 ms after bounce because of lower radiated neutrino luminosities and\nmean energies and thus reduced neutrino heating. In contrast, only the fast\nrotating model develops an explosion in 3D when the Si/Si-O interface collapses\nthrough the shock.

The stars have mass accretion rates\nspanning from 10^{-12} to 10^{-7} Mo/yr. The line profile was deconvolved into\na low velocity component (LVC, < 40 km/s) and a high velocity component (HVC, >\n40 km/s ), originating from slow winds and high velocity jets, respectively.\nThe LVC is by far the most frequent component, with a detection rate of 77%,\nwhile only 30% of sources have a HVC. The [OI]6300 luminosity of both the LVC\nand HVC, when detected, correlates with stellar and accretion parameters of the\ncentral sources (i.e. Lstar , Mstar , Lacc , Macc), with similar slopes for the\ntwo components. The line luminosity correlates better with the accretion\nluminosity than with the stellar luminosity or stellar mass. We suggest that\naccretion is the main drivers for the line excitation and that MHD disc-winds\nare at the origin of both components. In the sub-sample of Lupus sources\nobserved with ALMA a relationship is found between the HVC peak velocity and\nthe outer disc inclination angle, as expected if the HVC traces jets ejected\nperpendicularly to the disc plane. Mass loss rates measured from the HVC span\nfrom ~ 10^{-13} to ~10^{-7} Mo/yr. The corresponding Mloss/Macc ratio ranges\nfrom ~0.01 to ~0.5, with an average value of 0.07.

The dark\nmatter particle candidates are axion-like, with masses of order eV and strong\nself-interactions. They Bose-Einstein condense into a superfluid phase in the\ncentral regions of galaxy halos. The superfluid phonon excitations in turn\ncouple to baryons and mediate an additional long-range force. For a suitable\nchoice of the superfluid equation of state, this force can mimic Milgrom's law.\nIn this paper we develop in detail some of the main phenomenological\nconsequences of such a formalism, by revisiting the expected dark matter halo\nprofile in the presence of an extended baryon distribution. In particular, we\nshow how rotation curves of both high and low surface brightness galaxies can\nbe reproduced, with a slightly rising rotation curve at large radii in massive\nhigh surface brightness galaxies, thus subtly different from Milgrom's law. We\nfinally point out other expected differences with Milgrom's law, in particular\nin dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies, tidal dwarf galaxies, and globular\nclusters, whose Milgromian or Newtonian behavior depends on the position with\nrespect to the superfluid core of the host galaxy. We also expect ultra-diffuse\ngalaxies within galaxy clusters to have velocities slightly above the baryonic\nTully-Fisher relation. Finally, we note that, in this framework, photons and\ngravitons follow the same geodesics, and that galaxy-galaxy lensing, probing\nlarger distances within galaxy halos than rotation curves, should follow\npredictions closer to the standard cosmological model than those of Milgrom's\nlaw. \n\n"}

I carried out an exact and\nexhaustive derivation of all tree-level terms of the non-Gaussian covariance of\nthe galaxy $C_\\ell$, with the computation developed up to the third order in\nperturbation theory and local halo bias, including the non-local tidal tensor\neffect. A diagrammatic method was used to derive the involved galaxy 3D\ntrispectra, including shot-noise contributions.

Recently, the first DAMPE results on the CRE flux hinted at a narrow\nexcess at energy ~1.4 TeV. We show that in general a spectral structure with a\nnarrow width appears in two scenarios: I) \"Spectrum broadening\" for the\ncontinuous sources with a delta-function-like injection spectrum. In this\nscenario, a finite width can develop after propagation through the Galaxy,\nwhich can reveal the distance of the source. Well-motivated sources include\nmini-spikes and subhalos formed by dark matter (DM) particles $\\chi_{s}$ which\nannihilate directly into e+e- pairs. II) \"Phase-space shrinking\" for burst-like\nsources with a power-law-like injection spectrum. The spectrum after\npropagation can shrink at a cooling-related cutoff energy and form a sharp\nspectral peak. The peak can be more prominent due to the energy-dependent\ndiffusion. In this scenario, the width of the excess constrains both the power\nindex and the distance of the source. Possible such sources are pulsar wind\nnebulae (PWNe) and supernova remnants (SNRs). We analysis the DAMPE excess and\nfind that the continuous DM sources should be fairly close within ~0.3 kpc, and\nthe annihilation cross sections are close to the thermal value. For the\nburst-like source, the narrow width of the excess suggests that the injection\nspectrum must be hard with power index significantly less than two, the\ndistance is within ~(3-4) kpc, and the age of the source is ~0.16 Myr. In both\nscenarios, large anisotropies in the CRE flux are predicted. We identify\npossible candidates of mini-spike (PWN) sources in the current Fermi-LAT 3FGL\n(ATNF) catalog. The diffuse gamma-rays from these sources can be well below the\nGalactic diffuse gamma-ray backgrounds and less constrained by the Ferm-LAT\ndata, if they are located at the low Galactic latitude regions. \n\n"}

Despite a\nvery short observation of only 3.7 ks, the Soft X-ray Spectrometer (SXS) easily\ndetects the line complexes of highly ionized S K and Fe K with 16-17 counts in\neach. The Fe feature is measured for the first time at high spectral\nresolution. Based on the plausible assumption that the Fe K emission is\ndominated by He-like ions, we find that the material responsible for this Fe\nemission is highly redshifted at ~800 km/s compared to the local LMC\ninterstellar medium (ISM), with a 90% credible interval of 50-1500 km/s if a\nweakly informative prior is placed on possible line broadening. This indicates\n(1) that the Fe emission arises from the supernova ejecta, and (2) that these\nejecta are highly asymmetric, since no blue-shifted component is found. The S K\nvelocity is consistent with the local LMC ISM, and is likely from swept-up ISM\nmaterial. These results are consistent with spatial mapping that shows the\nHe-like Fe concentrated in the interior of the remnant and the S tracing the\nouter shell. The results also show that even with a very small number of\ncounts, direct velocity measurements from Doppler-shifted lines detected in\nextended objects like supernova remnants are now possible. Thanks to the very\nlow SXS background of ~1 event per spectral resolution element per 100 ks, such\nresults are obtainable during short pointed or slew observations with similar\ninstruments. This highlights the power of high-spectral-resolution imaging\nobservations, and demonstrates the new window that has been opened with Hitomi\nand will be greatly widened with future missions such as the X-ray Astronomy\nRecovery Mission (XARM) and Athena. \n\n"}

The observed variability of asymmetric,\ndouble-peaked emission line profiles in about half of such systems could be\ninterpreted as the signature of precession of an eccentric gaseous debris disk.\nThe variability timescales --- from decades down to $1.4$ yr (recently inferred\nfor the debris disk around HE 1349--2305) --- are in rough agreement with the\nrate of general relativistic (GR) precession in the test particle limit.\nHowever, it has not been demonstrated that this mechanism can drive such a\nfast, coherent precession of a radially extended (out to $1 R_\\odot$) gaseous\ndisk mediated by internal stresses (pressure). Here we use the linear theory of\neccentricity evolution in hydrodynamic disks to determine several key\nproperties of eccentric modes in gaseous debris disks around WDs. We find a\ncritical dependence of both the precession period and radial eccentricity\ndistribution of the modes on the inner disk radius, $r_\\mathrm{in}$. For small\ninner radii, $r_\\mathrm{in} \\lesssim (0.2 - 0.4) R_\\odot$, the modes are\nGR-driven, with periods of $\\approx 1 - 10$ yr.

Building such relationship is critical in controlling systematic errors\nassociated with supernova cosmology. Based on a collection of well-observed\nSNIa samples accumulated in the past years, we construct an empirical SNIa\nlight curve model using a statistical method called the functional principal\ncomponent analysis (FPCA) for sparse and irregularly sampled functional data.\nUsing this method, the entire light curve of an SNIa is represented by a linear\ncombination of principal component functions, and the SNIa is represented by a\nfew numbers called principal component scores. These scores are used to\nestablish relations between light curve shapes and physical quantities such as\nintrinsic color, interstellar dust reddening, spectral line strength, and\nspectral classes. These relations allow for descriptions of some critical\nphysical quantities based purely on light curve shape parameters.

If one focuses on the onset of the collective oscillations,\non the other hand, the equations can be linearized and the technique of linear\nanalysis can be employed.

In this paper, we\nanalyze in detail the origin of these unphysical modes and present a simple\nsolution to this annoying problem.

We find that the\nradial profile of 21-cm differential brightness temperature is quite sensitive\nto the stellar and halo masses, which reflects the time evolution of the escape\nfraction. In the case of a less massive star, ionizing photons hardly escape\nfrom its host halo due to the absorption by dense halo gas, thus an deep 21-cm\nabsorption feature at just outside the halo lasts a long time.

This polarization feature is\ngenerally believed to be due to an inner aspherical core revealed in the late\nphase, while this polarization feature can also be contributed by the effect of\npolarized-scattered echoes by circumstellar (CS) dust around the SN. In this\npaper, we propose a unique method to distinguish polarization from the SN\nejecta and from the light echo. We quantitatively examine wavelength dependence\nof the polarization created by the scattered echoes for various geometries and\namounts of CS dust. It is found that the polarization in the $U$-band has\ncharacteristic features, i.e., the polarization emerges at an earlier phase\nwith higher polarization degree than that in longer wavelengths. These are due\nto the rapid evolution of the $U$-band light curve as well as higher optical\ndepth of dust in shorter wavelengths. Except for the $U$ band, the polarization\nincreases after the plateau phase, and the polarization degree is generally\nhigher for shorter wavelengths. These polarimetric features can be easily\ndistinguished from the polarization expected from an aspherical core, which\npredicts almost no wavelength dependence.

Using our recent solutions for the non-rigid precessional dynamics, and\nviscous dissipation integrals derived in this paper, we make the only\nself-consistent calculation to date of these dissipation rates. We present the\nfirst results for the full coupled evolution of spindown and inclination angle\nfor a model of a late-stage proto-neutron star with a strong toroidal magnetic\nfield, allowing for both electromagnetic torques and internal dissipation when\nevolving the inclination angle. We explore this coupled evolution for a range\nof initial inclination angles, rotation rates and magnetic field strengths. For\nfixed initial inclination angle, our results indicate that the neutron-star\npopulation naturally evolves into two classes: near-aligned and near-orthogonal\nrotators -- with typical pulsars falling into the latter category. Millisecond\nmagnetars can evolve into the near-aligned rotators which mature magnetars\nappear to be, but only for small initial inclination angle and internal\ntoroidal fields stronger than roughly $5\\times 10^{15}$ G. Once any model has\nevolved to either an aligned or orthogonal state, there appears to be no\nfurther evolution away from this state at later times. \n\n"}

Recent work has\nsuggested that the magnification bias of galaxies due to foreground matter\nperturbations breaks the bias-independence of the $E_G$ statistic. The\nmagnitude of this effect is very sensitive to the clustering and magnification\nbiases of the galaxy sample.

A second order effect in the fluid\nequations was recently found to make a significant contribution: an offset\nvelocity between gas and dark matter, the so-called streaming velocity.\nPrevious simulations of a limited number of low-mass dark matter haloes suggest\nthat this streaming velocity can delay the formation of the first stars and\ndecrease halo gas fractions and the halo mass function in the low mass regime.\nHowever, a systematic exploration of its effects in a large sample of haloes\nhas been lacking until now. In this paper, we present results from a set of\ncosmological simulations of regions of the Universe with different streaming\nvelocities performed with the moving mesh code AREPO. Our simulations have very\nhigh mass resolution, enabling us to accurately resolve minihaloes as small as\n$10^5 \\: {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$. We show that in the absence of streaming, the least\nmassive halo that contains cold gas has a mass $M_{\\rm halo, min} = 5 \\times\n10^{5} \\: {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$, but that cooling only becomes efficient in a\nmajority of haloes for halo masses greater than $M_{\\rm halo,50\\%} = 1.6 \\times\n10^6 \\: {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$.
