Our method takes advantage of the same\nelectron bunch to produce both an XFEL pulse and an ultrashort optical pulse\nwith the help of an optical radiator downstream of the x-ray undulator. Since\nboth pulses are produced by the same electron bunch, they are perfectly\nsynchronized. Application of cross-correlation techniques will allow to\ndetermine relative jitter between the optical pulse (and, thus, the XFEL pulse)\nand a pulse from an external pump-laser with femtosecond resolution. Technical\nrealization of the proposed timing scheme uses an optical replica synthesizer\n(ORS) setup to be installed after the final bunch-compression stage of the\nXFEL. The electron bunch is modulated in the ORS setup by an external optical\nlaser. Subsequently, it travels through the main undulator, and produces the\nXFEL pulse.

We apply this formalism\nto a Rashba 2DEG ferromagnet and calculate the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) and\nanisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR). The numerical calculations reproduce\nanalytical results in the metallic regime revealing the crossover between the\nskew scattering mechanism dominating in the clean systems and intrinsic\nmechanism dominating in the moderately dirty systems. As we increase the\ndisorder further, the AHE starts to diminish due to the spectral broadening of\nthe quasiparticles. Although for certain parameters this reduction of the AHE\ncan be approximated as $\\sigma_{xy}\\thicksim\\sigma_{xx}^{\\varphi}$ with\n$\\varphi$ varying around 1.6, this is found not to be true in general as\n$\\sigma_{xy}$ can go through a change in sign as a function of disorder\nstrength in some cases.

The observed high-frequency\ninstability is mitigated using methods including an electromagnetic solver with\ntunable coefficients, its extension to accomodate Perfectly Matched Layers and\nFriedman's damping algorithms, as well as an efficient large bandwidth digital\nfilter. It is shown that choosing the frame of the wake as the frame of\nreference allows for higher levels of filtering and damping than is possible in\nother frames for the same accuracy.

The theory presents an extension of the analysis in symmetric\nreflection geometry [1] to the generic case, which includes Bragg diffraction\nboth in reflection (Bragg) and transmission (Laue) asymmetric scattering\ngeometries. The spatiotemporal response is presented as a product of a\ncrystal-intrinsic plane wave spatiotemporal response function and an envelope\nfunction defined by the crystal-independent transverse profile of the incident\nbeam and the scattering geometry. The diffracted wavefields exhibit amplitude\nmodulation perpendicular to the propagation direction due to both angular\ndispersion and the dispersion due to Bragg's law. The characteristic measure of\nthe spatiotemporal response is expressed in terms of a few parameters: the\nextinction length, crystal thickness, Bragg angle, asymmetry angle, and the\nspeed of light. Applications to self-seeding of hard x-ray free electron lasers\nare discussed, with particular emphasis on the relative advantages of using\neither the Bragg or Laue scattering geometries. Intensity front inclination in\nasymmetric diffraction can be used to make snapshots of ultra-fast processes\nwith femtosecond resolution. \n\n"}

In part I we consider a discrepancy in the\nderivation of the electromagnetic self force for a point charge. In the point\ncharge framework the self force can be defined as an integral of the\nLienard-Wiechert stress 3-forms over a suitably defined worldtube. We show the\nSchott term may be obtained using a null displacement vector to define the\nworldtube providing certain conditions are realized.\n  Part II comprises an investigation into a problem in accelerator physics. In\na high energy accelerator the cross-section of the beampipe is not continuous\nand there exist geometric discontinuities such as collimators and cavities.\nWhen a relativistic bunch of particles passes such a discontinuity the field\ngenerated by a leading charge can interact with the wall and consequently\naffect the motion of trailing charges. The fields acting on the trailing\ncharges are known as (geometric) wakefields. We model a bunch of particles as a\none dimensional continuum of point charges and by calculating the accumulated\nLienard-Wiechert fields we address the possibility of reducing wakefields at a\ncollimator interface by altering the path of the beam prior to collimation.\nThis approach is facilitated by the highly relativistic regime in which lepton\naccelerators operate, where the Coulomb field given from the Lienard-Wiechert\npotential is highly collimated in the direction of motion. It will be seen that\nthe potential reduction depends upon the ratio of the bunch length to the width\nof the collimator aperture as well as the relativistic factor and path of the\nbeam. Given that the aperture of the collimator is generally on the order of\nmillimetres we will see that for very short bunches, on the order of hundredths\nof a picosecond, a significant reduction is achieved. \n\n"}

However the principle could be applied to\nother ions or ionized molecules as well. For the production of proton beams by\nstripping extraction of an $H_2^+$-beam, we discuss possible designs for three\ntypes of machines: First a low-energy cyclotron for the simultaneous production\nof several beams at multiple energies - for instance 15 MeV, 30 MeV and 70 MeV\n- thus allowing to have beam on several isotope production targets.

The baseline program for the European Spallation Source linac is\nthat it will be fully operational at 5 MW average power by 2022, producing 2\nGeV 2.86 ms long proton pulses at a rate of 14 Hz. Our proposal is to upgrade\nthe linac to 10 MW average power and 28 Hz, producing 14 pulses/s for neutron\nproduction and 14 pulses/s for neutrino production. Furthermore, because of the\nhigh current required in the pulsed neutrino horn, the length of the pulses\nused for neutrino production needs to be compressed to a few $\\mu$s with the\naid of an accumulator ring. A long baseline experiment using this Super Beam\nand a megaton underground Water Cherenkov detector located in existing mines\n300-600 km from Lund will make it possible to discover leptonic CP violation at\n5 $\\sigma$ significance level in up to 50% of the leptonic Dirac CP-violating\nphase range. This experiment could also determine the neutrino mass hierarchy\nat a significance level of more than 3 $\\sigma$ if this issue will not already\nhave been settled by other experiments by then. The mass hierarchy performance\ncould be increased by combining the neutrino beam results with those obtained\nfrom atmospheric neutrinos detected by the same large volume detector. This\ndetector will also be used to measure the proton lifetime, detect cosmological\nneutrinos and neutrinos from supernova explosions. Results on the sensitivity\nto leptonic CP violation and the neutrino mass hierarchy are presented. \n\n"}

In arXiv:1306.3995, Gogolin et al.\nclaimed that even an ideal BosonSampling device's output would be\n\"operationally indistinguishable\" from a uniform random outcome, at least\n\"without detailed a priori knowledge\"; or at any rate, that telling the two\napart might itself be a hard problem. We first answer these claims---explaining\nwhy the first is based on a definition of \"a priori knowledge\" so strange that,\nwere it adopted, almost no quantum algorithm could be distinguished from a pure\nrandom-number source; while the second is neither new nor a practical obstacle\nto interesting BosonSampling experiments. However, we then go further, and\naddress some interesting research questions inspired by Gogolin et al.'s\nmistaken arguments. We prove that, with high probability over a Haar-random\nmatrix A, the BosonSampling distribution induced by A is far from the uniform\ndistribution in total variation distance. More surprisingly, and directly\ncounter to Gogolin et al., we give an efficient algorithm that distinguishes\nthese two distributions with constant bias. Finally, we offer three \"bonus\"\nresults about BosonSampling. First, we report an observation of Fernando\nBrandao: that one can efficiently sample a distribution that has large entropy\nand that's indistinguishable from a BosonSampling distribution by any circuit\nof fixed polynomial size. Second, we show that BosonSampling distributions can\nbe efficiently distinguished from uniform even with photon losses and for\ngeneral initial states. Third, we offer the simplest known proof that\nFermionSampling is solvable in classical polynomial time, and we reuse\ntechniques from our BosonSampling analysis to characterize random\nFermionSampling distributions. \n\n"}

As channeled particles approach the\natomic planes of a crystal, they are likely to be dechanneled. This effect was\nused in ion-beam analysis with MeV energy. We studied this effect in a bent\ncrystal for positive and negative particles within a wide range of energies in\nsight of application of such crystals at accelerators. We found the conditions\nfor the appearance or not of channeling oscillations. Indeed a new kind of\noscillations, strictly related to the motion of over-barrier particles, i.e.\nquasichanneling particles, has been predicted. Such oscillations, named planar\nquasichanneling oscillations, possess a different nature than channeling\noscillations.

This Letter presents an experimental study to identify the\nparameters that most strongly influence flux trapping in high purity niobium\nduring cooldown. This is critical to the operation of superconducting\nradiofrequency cavities, in which trapped flux degrades the quality factor and\ntherefore cryogenic efficiency.

Particle tracking shows that the electron beam\ndirection changes after the kick, while the orientation of the microbunching\nwavefront stays unvaried. Therefore, electrons motion and wavefront normal have\ndifferent directions. Coherent radiation emission in a downstream undulator is\nexpected to be dramatically suppressed as soon as the kick angle becomes larger\nthan the divergence of the output radiation. In fact, according to conventional\ntreatments, coherent radiation is emitted along the normal to the microbunching\nwavefront. Here we show that kinematics predicts a surprising effect.

The dominant\nsystematic error limiting such a measurement comes from spurious spin\nprecession caused by unintentional and unknown average radial magnetic field\n$B_r$ acting on the (vastly larger) magnetic dipole moments (MDM) of the\nprotons. Along with taking extreme magnetic shielding measures, the best\nprotection against this systematic error is to use the storage ring itself, as\na \"self-magnetometer\"; the exact magnetic field average $\\langle B_r\\rangle$\nthat produces systematic EDM error, is nulled to exquisite precision by orbit\nposition control.\n  By using octupole rather than quadrupole focusing the restoring force can be\nvanishingly small for small amplitude vertical betatron-like motion yet strong\nenough at large amplitudes to keep all particles captured. This greatly\nenhances the magnetometer sensitivity. Any average radial magnetic field error\n$\\langle\\Delta B_r\\rangle$ causes a vertical orbit shift between CW and CCW\nbeams.

Recently, cooling down with a large\nspatial temperature gradient attracts much attention for successful reductions\nof trapped vortices. The purpose of the present paper is to propose a model to\nexplain the observed efficient flux expulsions and the role of spatial\ntemperature gradient during the cool-down of cavity. In the vicinity of a\nregion with a temperature close to the critical temperature Tc,the critical\nfields are strongly suppressed and can be smaller than the ambient magnetic\nfield. A region with a lower critical field smaller than the ambient field is\nin the vortex state. As a material is cooled down, a region with a temperature\nclose Tc associating the vortex state domain sweeps and passes through the\nmaterial. In this process, vortices contained in the vortex state domain are\ntrapped by pinning centers that randomly distribute in the material. A number\nof trapped vortices can be naively estimated by using the analogy with the\nbeam-target collision event. Based on this result, the residual resistance is\nevaluated. We find that a number of trapped vortices and the residual\nresistance are proportional to the strength of the ambient magnetic field and\nthe inverse of the temperature gradient. The obtained residual resistance\nagrees well with experimental results. A material property dependence of a\nnumber of trapped vortices is also discussed. \n\n"}

We focus on\nionisation injection configurations and in the conditions where the laser pulse\ndriver can force collective betatron oscillations over the whole trapped\nelectron bunch. With an analytical model and by employing three dimensional\nsimulations and radiation calculations, we find that circularly or elliptically\npolarised laser drivers can force helical betatron oscillations, which produce\ncircularly/elliptically polarised betatron x-rays.

The protection of equipment from beam accidents is more recent.\nIt is related to the increasing beam power of high-power proton accelerators\nsuch as ISIS, SNS, ESS and the PSI cyclotron, to the emission of synchrotron\nlight by electron-positron accelerators and FELs, and to the increase of energy\nstored in the beam (in particular for hadron colliders such as LHC).

The\nion-wake is shown to be a driven non-linear ion-acoustic wave in the form of a\ncylindrical ion-soliton. The near-void and radially-outwards propagating\nion-wake channel of a few plasma skin-depth radius, is explored for application\nto \"Crunch-in\" regime of positron acceleration. The coupling from the electron\nwakefield mode to the ion-mode dictates the long-term evolution of the plasma\nand the time for its relaxation back to an equilibrium, limiting the\nrepetition-rate of a plasma accelerator. Using an analytical model it is shown\nthat it is the time asymmetric phases of the oscillating radial electric fields\nof the nearly-stationary electron bubble that excite time-averaged inertial ion\nmotion radially. The electron compression in the back of the bubble sucks-in\nthe ions whereas the space-charge within the bubble cavity expels them, driving\na cylindrical ion-soliton structure with on-axis and bubble-edge\ndensity-spikes.

X-ray binaries contain accreting neutron stars\nand stellar--mass black holes which are the end points of massive star\nevolution. Studying these remnants thus provides clues to understanding the\nevolutionary processes that lead to their formation. We focus here on the\ndistributions of dynamical masses, space velocities and chemical anomalies of\ntheir companion stars. These three observational features provide unique\ninformation on the physics of core collapse and supernovae explosions within\ninteracting binary systems. There is suggestive evidence for a gap between ~2-5\nMsun in the observed mass distribution. This might be related to the physics of\nthe supernova explosions although selections effects and possible systematics\nmay be important. The difference between neutron star mass measurements in\nlow-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) and pulsar masses in high-mass X-ray binaries\n(HMXBs) reflect their different accretion histories, with the latter presenting\nvalues close to birth masses. On the other hand, black holes in LMXBs appear to\nbe limited to <~12 Msun because of strong mass-loss during the wind Wolf-Rayet\nphase. Detailed studies of a limited sample of black-hole X-ray binaries\nsuggest that the more massive black holes have a lower space velocity, which\ncould be explained if they formed through direct collapse. Conversely, the\nformation of low-mass black holes through a supernova explosion implies that\nlarge escape velocities are possible through ensuing natal and/or Blaauw kicks.\nFinally, chemical abundance studies of the companion stars in seven X-ray\nbinaries indicate they are metal-rich (all except GRO J1655-40) and possess\nlarge peculiar abundances of alpha-elements (Abridged) \n\n"}

The adjoint simulation corresponds\nphysically to the reciprocal situation of a point charge moving through the\naccelerator gap and radiating.

By using a piezo-actuated mechanical holder, which allowed to\nremotely change the crystal curvature, it was possible to study the steering\ncapability of planar channeling and volume reflection vs. the curvature radius\nand the atomic number, Z. For silicon, the channeling efficiency exceeds 35 %,\na record for negatively charged particles.

In this\npaper, we propose a three-dimensional envelope instability model to study the\ninstability for a bunched beam in a periodic solenoid and radio-frequency (RF)\nfocusing channel and a periodic quadrupole and RF focusing channel. This study\nshows that when the transverse zero current phase advance is below $90$\ndegrees, the beam envelope can still become unstable if the longitudinal zero\ncurrent phase advance is beyond $90$ degrees. For the transverse zero current\nphase advance beyond $90$ degrees, the instability stopband width becomes\nlarger with the increase of the longitudinal focusing strength and even shows\ndifferent structure from the 2D case when the longitudinal zero current phase\nadvance is beyond $90$ degrees.

Unexpected discoveries, such as the\ndiphoton excess F(750 GeV) seen at the LHC, could strongly motivate the\nconstruction of a photon collider. In order to enable the gamma-gamma collision\noption, the ILC design should be compatible with it from the very beginning. In\nthis paper, we discuss the problem of the beam crossing angle. In the ILC\ntechnical design, this angle is 14 mrad, which is just enough to provide enough\nspace for the final quadrupoles and outgoing beams. For gamma-gamma collisions,\nthe crossing angle must be larger because the low-energy electrons that result\nfrom multiple Compton scattering get large disruption angles in collisions with\nthe opposing electron beam and some deflection in the solenoidal detector\nfield. For a 2E=500 GeV collider, the required crossing angle is about 25 mrad.\nIn this paper, we consider the factors that determine the crossing angle as\nwell as its minimum permissible value that does not yet cause a considerable\nreduction of the gamma-gamma luminosity. It is shown that the best solution is\nto increase the laser wavelength from the current 1 \\mum (which is optimal for\n2E=500 GeV) to 2 \\mum as this makes possible achieving high gamma-gamma\nluminosities at a crossing angle of 20 mrad, which is also quite comfortable\nfor e+e- collisions, does not cause any degradation of the e+e- luminosity and\nopens the possibility for a more energetic future collider in the same tunnel\n(e.g., CLIC).

It is especially true for low\nfrequency SRF guns where electrons are generated at photocathodes at the crest\nof accelerating voltage. Two main physics challenges of SRF guns are their\ncompatibility with high QE photocathodes and multipacting. The first is related\nto a possibility of deposition of photocathode materials (such as Cs) on the\nwalls of the SRF cavity, which can result in increased dark current via\nreduction of the bulk Nb work function and in enhancing of a secondary electron\nemission yield (SEY). SEY plays critical role in multipacting, which could both\nspoil the gun vacuum and speed up the deposition of the cathode material on the\nwalls of the SRF cavity.

For sufficiently strong space charge (SC), the instability threshold\nof the wake-driven coherent tune shift normally increases linearly with the SC\ntune shift, as independently concluded by several authors using different\nmethods. This stability condition has, however, a very strange feature: at\nstrong SC, it is totally insensitive to the number of particles.

In order to increase the energy or reduce the size of the\naccelerator, new acceleration schemes need to be developed. Plasma wakefield\nacceleration, in which the electrons in a plasma are excited, leading to strong\nelectric fields, is one such promising novel acceleration technique. Pioneering\nexperiments have shown that an intense laser pulse or electron bunch traversing\na plasma, drives electric fields of 10s GV/m and above. These values are well\nbeyond those achieved in conventional RF accelerators which are limited to ~0.1\nGV/m. A limitation of laser pulses and electron bunches is their low stored\nenergy, which motivates the use of multiple stages to reach very high energies.\nThe use of proton bunches is compelling, as they have the potential to drive\nwakefields and accelerate electrons to high energy in a single accelerating\nstage. The long proton bunches currently available can be used, as they undergo\nself-modulation, a particle-plasma interaction which longitudinally splits the\nbunch into a series of high density microbunches, which then act resonantly to\ncreate large wakefields.

The negative charge of the\naccelerated electrons inside the channel generates a quasi-static transverse\nelectric field that causes gradual ion expansion into the channel. Once the\nions fill the channel, the pinching force from the quasi-static magnetic field\ngenerated by the accelerated electrons becomes uncompensated due to the\nreduction of the quasi-static transverse electric field. As a result there are\ntwo distinct populations of accelerated electrons: those that accelerate ahead\nof the expanding ion front while moving predominantly forward and those that\naccelerate in the presence of the ions in the channel while performing strong\ntransverse oscillations. The ions diminish the role of the longitudinal laser\nelectric field, making the transverse electric field the dominant contributor\nto the electron energy. The ion expansion also has a profound impact on the\ngamma-ray emission, causing it to become volumetrically distributed while\nreducing the total emitted energy.

Both for\nensembles and individual orbits, as N increases there is a smooth convergence\ntowards a continuum limit. Discreteness effects are well modeled by Gaussian\nwhite noise with relaxation time t_R = const * (N/log L)t_D, with L the Coulomb\nlogarithm and t_D the dynamical time scale. Discreteness effects accelerate\nemittance growth for initially localised clumps. However, even allowing for\ndiscreteness effects one can distinguish between orbits which, in the continuum\nlimit, feel a regular potential, so that emittance grows as a power law in\ntime, and chaotic orbits, where emittance grows exponentially. For sufficiently\nlarge N, one can distinguish two different `kinds' of chaos. Short range\nmicrochaos, associated with close encounters between charges, is a generic\nfeature, yielding large positive Lyapunov exponents X_N which do not decrease\nwith increasing N even if the bulk potential is integrable. Alternatively,\nthere is the possibility of larger scale macrochaos, characterised by smaller\nLyapunov exponents X_S, which is present only if the bulk potential is chaotic.\nConventional computations of Lyapunov exponents probe X_N, leading to the\noxymoronic conclusion that N-body orbits which look nearly regular and have\nsharply peaked Fourier spectra are `very chaotic.' However, the `range' of the\nmicrochaos, set by the typical interparticle spacing, decreases as N increases,\nso that, for large N, this microchaos, albeit very strong, is largely\nirrelevant macroscopically.

Spin motion on the periodic\nclosed orbit of a storage ring can be analyzed in terms of the Floquet theorem\nfor equations of motion with periodic parameters and a spin precession\nfrequency emerges in a Floquet exponent as an additional frequency of the\nsystem. To define a spin precession frequency on nonperiodic synchro-betatron\norbits we exploit the important concept of quasiperiodicity. This allows a\ngeneralization of the Floquet theorem so that a spin precession frequency can\nbe defined in this case too. This frequency appears in a Floquet-like exponent\nas an additional frequency in the system in analogy with the case of motion on\nthe closed orbit.

In the case of hadron beams, whose charge distribution\ncan be considered as \"frozen\" within a cylindrical core of small radius\ncompared to the beam's dynamical aperture, analytical formulas have been\nrecently derived \\cite{BenTurc} for the contribution of space charges within\nfirst order Hamiltonian perturbation theory. These formulas involve\ndistribution functions which, in general, do not lead to expressions that can\nbe evaluated in closed form. In this paper, we apply this theory to an example\nof a charge distribution, whose effect on the dynamics can be derived\nexplicitly and in closed form, both in the case of 2--dimensional as well as\n4--dimensional mapping models of hadron beams. We find that, even for very\nsmall values of the \"perveance\" (strength of the space charge effect) the long\nterm stability of the dynamics changes considerably. In the flat beam case, the\nouter invariant \"tori\" surrounding the origin disappear, decreasing the size of\nthe beam's dynamical aperture, while beyond a certain threshold the beam is\nalmost entirely lost. Analogous results in mapping models of beams with\n2-dimensional cross section demonstrate that in that case also, even for weak\ntune depressions, orbital diffusion is enhanced and many particles whose motion\nwas bounded now escape to infinity, indicating that space charges can impose\nsignificant limitations on the beam's luminosity. \n\n"}

This\nis dictated by a desire to study very rare processes with maximum data sample.\nHEP colliders are engineering structures of many kilometers in length, whose\ntransverse compactness is achieved by the application of the superconducting\ntechnologies and limitations of cost.\n  However the compactness of the structural elements conceals and potential\ndanger for the stable work of the accelerator. This is because a high intensity\nbeam of positively charged particles (protons, positrons, ions) creates around\nitself an electric self-field of very high intensity, $10^5 - 10^6$ V/cm. Being\nlocated near the conducting surfaces, at the distances of 1-20 mm away from\nthem, the field of such bunches activates the field emission of electrons from\nthe surface. These electrons, in addition to electrons from the ionization of\nresidual gases, secondary electrons and electrons knocked out by synchrotron\nradiation, contribute to the development of a dense electron cloud in the\ntransport line. The particles of the bunch, being scattered on the dense\nelectron cloud with $N_e\\sim N_p$, leaves the beam and may cause noticeable\ndamage. The paper presents an analysis of the conditions, under which the field\nemission in the LHC collimator system may become a serious problem.

At Los Alamos the CINDER'90 code and library\nhave been developed for nuclide inventory calculations using neutron-reaction\n(En < 20 MeV) and/or decay data for 3400 nuclides; coupled with the LAHET Code\nSystem (LCS), irradiations in neutron and proton environments below a few GeV\nare tractable; additional work with the European Activation File, the HMS-ALICE\ncode and the reaction models of MCNPX (CEM95, BERTINI, or ISABEL with or\nwithout preequilibrium, evaporation and fission) have been used to produce\nevaluated reaction data for neutrons and protons to 1.7 GeV. At the Pacific\nNorthwest National Laboratory, efforts have focused on production of medical\nisotopes and the identification of available neutron reaction data from results\nof integral measurements. \n\n"}

In this, beams of nu_mu and nubar_e arise from the decay of mu-\nparticles (or alternatively, nubar_mu and nu_e from mu+). The muons come from\nthe decay of low-energy pions produced by a megawatt proton beam incident on a\nnuclear target. The muons are captured into a magnetic channel, \"cooled\" by\nionization in liquid hydrogen, accelerated to energy of order 50 GeV, and\ninjected into a storage ring. A nonhorizontal ring can deliver neutrino beams\nto an on-site detector, as well as to two off-site detectors separated by\nglobal distances. Such a neutrino factory is a challenging extension of present\naccelerator technology. It is also a natural path to a muon collider, in that\nboth facilities share many common elements upstream of their storage rings.\nPrior to a formal design study, R&D must be performed in several keys areas,\nsuch detailed simulations and actual targetry and cooling experiments. This in\nan excellent opportunity to advance the field of accelerator physics both at\nnational laboratories and at universities. \n\n"}

The\nBraunstein--Kimble protocol is written for an unbalanced homodyne measurement\nand arbitrary input and resource states. We show that the output of the\nprotocol is a superposition between the input one-mode field and a classical\none induced by measurement and classical communication. We choose to describe\nthe input state distortion through teleportation by the average photon number\nof the measurement-induced field. Only in the case of symmetric resource states\nwe find a relation between the optimal added noise and the minimal EPR\ncorrelations used to define inseparability. \n\n"}
