A natural extension of a\ncausal set is an enumeration of its elements which respects the order. We bring\ntogether two different classes of random processes. In one class, we are given\na fixed causal set, and we consider random natural extensions of this causal\nset: we think of the random enumeration as being generated one point at a time.\nIn the other class of processes, we generate a random causal set, working from\nthe bottom up, adding one new maximal element at each stage. Processes of both\ntypes can exhibit a property called order-invariance: if we stop the process\nafter some fixed number of steps, then, conditioned on the structure of the\ncausal set, every possible order of generation of its elements is equally\nlikely. We develop a framework for the study of order-invariance which includes\nboth types of example: order-invariance is then a property of probability\nmeasures on a certain space.

Classical Monte Carlo simulations do, however, not suffer from\nthis divergence behavior of Euler's method because this divergence behavior\nhappens on rare events. Indeed, for such nonlinear SDEs the classical Monte\nCarlo Euler method has been shown to converge by exploiting that the Euler\napproximations diverge only on events whose probabilities decay to zero very\nrapidly. Significantly more efficient than the classical Monte Carlo Euler\nmethod is the recently introduced multilevel Monte Carlo Euler method. The main\nobservation of this article is that this multilevel Monte Carlo Euler method\ndoes - in contrast to classical Monte Carlo methods - not converge in general\nin the case of such nonlinear SDEs.

It has already been shown,\nand we reaffirm it in this paper, that the $dcx$ ordering of point processes is\nsuitable to compare their clustering tendencies. Hence, it was tempting to\nconjecture that $r_c$ is increasing in $dcx$ order. Some numerical evidences\nsupport this conjecture for a special class of point processes, called\nperturbed lattices, which are \"toy models\" for determinantal and permanental\npoint processes. However, the conjecture is not true in full generality, since\none can construct a Cox point process with degenerate critical radius $r_c=0$,\nthat is $dcx$ larger than a given homogeneous Poisson point process.\nNevertheless, we are able to compare some nonstandard critical radii related,\nrespectively, to the finiteness of the expected number of void circuits around\nthe origin and asymptotic of the expected number of long occupied paths from\nthe origin in suitable discrete approximations of the continuum model. These\nnew critical radii sandwich the \"true\" one.

Now at each time k, choose 2 vertices uniformly\nat random and attach an edge between these two vertices. Let \\bfG_n(k) be the\ngraph obtained at step k. Refined analysis in random graph theory now shows\nthat for fixed t\\in \\Rbold, when k(n) = n/2+ n^{2/3} t/2, the sizes of the\ncomponents in \\bfG_n(k(n)) scale like n^{2/3} and rescaled component sizes\nconverge to the standard multiplicative coalescent at time $t$. The last decade\nhas seen variants of this process introduced, under the name Achlioptas\nprocesses, to understand the effect of simple changes in the edge formation\nscheme on the emergence of the giant component. Stimulated by a question of\nAchlioptas, one of the simplest and most popular of such models is the Bohman\nFrieze (BF) model wherein at each stage $k$, 2 edges e_1(k)=(v_1,v_2) and\ne_2(k) = (v_3, v_4) are chosen uniformly at random.

The fundamental inter-dependence between internal (spin,\norbital, or other) and external (i.e., spatial) degrees of freedom which\nunderlies compass models generally leads to very rich behaviors including the\nfrustration of (semi-)classical ordered states on non-frustrated lattices and\nto enhanced quantum effects prompting, in certain cases, the appearance of zero\ntemperature quantum spin liquids.

In particular, it was\nnoticed by Mandelbrot that empirical log-returns distributions are more\nconcentrated around the origin and have considerably heavier tails. This\nsuggests to adjust the Black-Scholes model by the introduction of the Levy\nprocesses instead of Brownian ones. This approach has been extensively studied\nin a univariate setup since the nineties. In the multivariate settings the\ntheory is not so advanced.

By applying the paracontrolled calculus introduced by\nGubinelli et al.

In particular, if the coupling constants of the nonlinear term\nof the coupled KPZ equation satisfy the so-called \"trilinear\" condition, the\nrenormalization factors can be taken the same in two approximations and the\ndifference of the limits of two approximations are explicitly computed.\nMoreover, under the trilinear condition, the Wiener measure twisted by the\ndiffusion matrix becomes stationary for the limit and we show that the solution\nof the limit equation exists globally in time when the initial value is sampled\nfrom the stationary measure.

Using\ncoupling arguments and explicit formulas, comparisons with related loss systems\nare then provided. Bounds are similarly obtained for the average total number\nof customers, with the stationary distribution explicitly determined on $\\{K,\n\\dots, 2K \\}$, and elsewhere upper bounded.

Aimed at a broad audience, the paper starts\nwith an introduction to the basic load balancing scenario, consisting of a\nsingle dispatcher where tasks arrive that must immediately be forwarded to one\nof $N$ single-server queues.\n  A popular class of load balancing algorithms are so-called power-of-$d$ or\nJSQ($d$) policies, where an incoming task is assigned to a server with the\nshortest queue among $d$ servers selected uniformly at random. This class\nincludes the Join-the-Shortest-Queue (JSQ) policy as a special case ($d = N$),\nwhich has strong stochastic optimality properties and yields a mean waiting\ntime that vanishes as $N$ grows large for any fixed subcritical load. However,\na nominal implementation of the JSQ policy involves a prohibitive communication\nburden in large-scale deployments. In contrast, a random assignment policy ($d\n= 1$) does not entail any communication overhead, but the mean waiting time\nremains constant as $N$ grows large for any fixed positive load.\n  In order to examine the fundamental trade-off between performance and\nimplementation overhead, we consider an asymptotic regime where $d(N)$ depends\non $N$. We investigate what growth rate of $d(N)$ is required to match the\nperformance of the JSQ policy on fluid and diffusion scale. The results\ndemonstrate that the asymptotics for the JSQ($d(N)$) policy are insensitive to\nthe exact growth rate of $d(N)$, as long as the latter is sufficiently fast,\nimplying that the optimality of the JSQ policy can asymptotically be preserved\nwhile dramatically reducing the communication overhead.

As\nis common in many imaging problems, natural signals are considered sparse with\nrespect to a known basis, and the generic sparsity prior is enforced via\n$\\ell_1$ regularization. While successful in the realm of linear inverse\nproblems, such $\\ell_1$ methods have encountered possibly fundamental\nlimitations, as no computationally efficient algorithm for phase retrieval of a\n$k$-sparse signal has been proven to succeed with fewer than $O(k^2\\log n)$\ngeneric measurements, exceeding the theoretical optimum of $O(k \\log n)$. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel framework for phase retrieval by 1) modeling\nnatural signals as being in the range of a deep generative neural network $G :\n\\mathbb{R}^k \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^n$ and 2) enforcing this prior directly by\noptimizing an empirical risk objective over the domain of the generator.

This formulation for structured phase retrieval thus has\ntwo advantages over sparsity based methods: 1) deep generative priors can more\ntightly represent natural signals and 2) information theoretically optimal\nsample complexity. We corroborate these results with experiments showing that\nexploiting generative models in phase retrieval tasks outperforms sparse phase\nretrieval methods. \n\n"}

However, experimental work is often carried out using systematic\nstrategies that cycle through coordinates in a deterministic manner, a dynamics\nsometimes known as systematic scan. The mixing time of systematic scan seems\nmore difficult to analyze than that of random updates, and little is currently\nknown. In this article we go some way toward correcting this imbalance. By\nadapting a variety of techniques, we derive upper and lower bounds (often\ntight) on the mixing time of systematic scan. An unusual feature of systematic\nscan as far as the analysis is concerned is that it fails to be time\nreversible. \n\n"}
