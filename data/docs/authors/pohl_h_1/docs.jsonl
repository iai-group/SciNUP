A 82, 012316 (2010)] to higher counting bases. The\nalgorithm makes use of qubits, qutrits, and qudits to count numbers in a base\n2, base 3, or base d representation. In operating the algorithm, the number n <\nN = d^K is read into a K-qudit register through its interaction with a stream\nof n particles passing in a nearby wire; this step corresponds to a quantum\nFourier transformation from the Hilbert space of particles to the Hilbert space\nof qudit states. An inverse quantum Fourier transformation provides the number\nn in the base d representation; the inverse transformation is fully quantum at\nthe level of individual qudits, while a simpler semi-classical version can be\nused on the level of qudit registers. Combining registers of qubits, qutrits,\nand qudits, where d is a prime number, with a simpler single-shot measurement\nallows to find the powers of 2, 3, and other primes d in the number n.

On\nthe other hand, quantum theory also predicts that environmental coupling\nproduces the opposite effect of spreading the wave function into a mixed state.\nStudying the effect of these two competing processes, as the ratio of their\nstrengths is varied, on the distribution of a quantum state is of fundamental\ninterest in any setting, but especially so in the mechanical realm. A key\nissue, however, is that a fundamental study of such physics can not entail an a\npriori assumption of the projection postulate itself, and Bayesian inference\nmay therefore not be employed to observe the quantum state.

For example, in the general theory of relativity the geometry is a\ndynamical structure that guides the motion of matter, and, in turn, it is bent\nand curved by the presence of matter. Other than this, the classical vacuum is\na structure void of any physical properties, since classically properties are\nstrictly associated with physical objects such as particles and\nfinite-amplitude fields. The situation is very different in quantum physics. As\nI will show in this paper, the difference stems from the fact that in quantum\nphysics the properties are not strictly tied to objects. We know for example\nthat physical properties come into existence - as values of observables - only\nwhen the object is measured. Thus, quantum physics allows us to detach\nproperties from objects. This has consequences: one does not need pre-existing\nreal objects to create actual properties, and indeed under certain\nperturbations the quantum vacuum produces observable effects such as energy\nshifts and creation of particles. An open question is if by necessity the\nvacuum comes with an embedded geometry, and if it is possible to construct\nviable physical theories in which geometry is detached from the vacuum. \n\n"}

Our\nfocus is on the applicability of these approaches to isolated quantum systems\nsuch as ultra-cold atoms in engineered optical potentials. For two lattices\nconnected by a junction, we find that the current and particle number\nfluctuations from the microcanonical approach compare well with the values\npredicted by the Landauer formalism and FCS assuming a binomial distribution.\nHowever, we demonstrate that well-defined reservoirs (i.e., particles in\nFermi-Dirac distributions) are not present for a substantial duration of the\nquasi-steady state.

At present, the best upper bound known for the power of quantum\ncomputation is that BQP is in AWPP. This work investigates limits on\ncomputational power that are imposed by physical principles. To this end, we\ndefine a circuit-based model of computation in a class of operationally-defined\ntheories more general than quantum theory, and ask: what is the minimal set of\nphysical assumptions under which the above inclusion still holds? We show that\ngiven only an assumption of tomographic locality (roughly, that multipartite\nstates can be characterised by local measurements), efficient computations are\ncontained in AWPP. This inclusion still holds even without assuming a basic\nnotion of causality (where the notion is, roughly, that probabilities for\noutcomes cannot depend on future measurement choices). Following Aaronson, we\nextend the computational model by allowing post-selection on measurement\noutcomes. Aaronson showed that the corresponding quantum complexity class is\nequal to PP. Given only the assumption of tomographic locality, the inclusion\nin PP still holds for post-selected computation in general theories. Thus in a\nworld with post-selection, quantum theory is optimal for computation in the\nspace of all general theories.

The recently developed resource theory\nof quantum coherence allows the formalisation of incoherent operations -- those\noperations which cannot create coherence. We identify the set of operations\nwhich additionally do not use coherence. These are such that coherence cannot\nbe exploited by a classical observer, who measures incoherent properties of the\nsystem, to go beyond classical dynamics. We give a physical interpretation in\nterms of interferometry and prove a dilation theorem, showing how these\noperations can always be constructed by interacting the system in an incoherent\nway with an ancilla. Such a physical justification is not known for the\nincoherent operations, thus our results lead to a physically well-motivated\nresource theory of coherence. Next, we investigate the implications for\ncoherence in multipartite systems. We show that quantum correlations can be\ndefined naturally with respect to a fixed basis, providing a link between\ncoherence and quantum discord. We demonstrate the interplay between these two\nquantities under our studied operations, and suggest implications for the\ntheory of quantum discord by relating the studied operations to those which\ncannot create discord. \n\n"}

However, a critical challenge\nfacing the development of these systems is to achieve strong coupling between\nmechanics and qubits while simultaneously reducing coupling of both the qubit\nand mechanical mode to the environment. Here we report measurements of a\nqubit-coupled mechanical resonator system consisting of an ultra-high-frequency\nnanoresonator and a long coherence-time superconducting transmon qubit,\nembedded in superconducting coplanar waveguide cavity. It is demonstrated that\nthe nanoresonator and transmon have commensurate energies and transmon\ncoherence times are one order of magnitude larger than for all previously\nreported qubit-coupled nanoresonators. Moreover, we show that numerical\nsimulations of this new hybrid quantum system are in good agreement with\nspectroscopic measurements and suggest that the nanoresonator in our device\nresides at low thermal occupation number, near its ground state, acting as a\ndissipative bath seen by the qubit.

In such a setting, it\nis often useful to know the maximum amount of information that can be reliably\ntransmitted per cost incurred. This is known as the capacity per unit cost. In\nthis paper, we generalize the capacity per unit cost to various communication\ntasks involving a quantum channel such as classical communication,\nentanglement-assisted classical communication, private communication, and\nquantum communication.

Although simple, the resulting local master equation (LME) is known to\nbe thermodynamically inconsistent. Otherwise, one may always obtain a\nconsistent \\textit{global} master equation (GME) by working on the energy basis\nof the full interacting Hamiltonian. Here, we consider a two-node `quantum\nwire' connected to two heat baths. The stationary solution of the LME and GME\nare obtained and benchmarked against the exact result. Importantly, in our\nmodel, the validity of the GME is constrained by the underlying secular\napproximation. Whenever this breaks down (for resonant weakly-coupled nodes),\nwe observe that the LME, in spite of being thermodynamically flawed: (a)\npredicts the correct steady state, (b) yields the exact asymptotic heat\ncurrents, and (c) reliably reflects the correlations between the nodes. In\ncontrast, the GME fails at all three tasks. Nonetheless, as the inter-node\ncoupling grows, the LME breaks down whilst the GME becomes correct. Hence, the\nglobal and local approach may be viewed as \\textit{complementary} tools, best\nsuited to different parameter regimes. \n\n"}

To arrive at\nthis result, we derive the leading corrections to the lumped-element Josephson\nparametric amplifier of three common pumping schemes: monochromatic current\npump, bichromatic current pump, and monochromatic flux pump. We show that the\nleading correction for the last two schemes is a single Kerr-type quartic term,\nwhile the first scheme contains additional cubic terms. In all cases, we find\nthat the corrections are detrimental to squeezing. In addition, we show that\nthe Kerr correction leads to a strongly phase-dependent reduction of the\nquantum efficiency of a phase-sensitive measurement. Finally, we quantify the\ndeparture from ideal Gaussian character of the filtered output field from\nnumerical calculation of third and fourth order cumulants. Our results show\nthat, while a Gaussian output field is expected for an ideal Josephson\nparametric amplifier, higher-order corrections lead to non-Gaussian effects\nwhich increase with both gain and nonlinearity strength.

Our\nalgorithm is an improved version of Stephen Jordan's gradient computation\nalgorithm, providing an approximation of the gradient $\\nabla f$ with\nquadratically better dependence on the evaluation accuracy of $f$, for an\nimportant class of smooth functions. Furthermore, we show that most objective\nfunctions arising from quantum optimization procedures satisfy the necessary\nsmoothness conditions, hence our algorithm provides a quadratic improvement in\nthe complexity of computing their gradient.

Key to\nthe DMFT process is the self-consistent map of the original system into an\nAnderson impurity model, the ground state of which is computed using an\nimpurity solver. The power of the method is thus limited by the complexity of\nthe impurity model the solver can handle. Simulating realistic systems\ngenerally requires many correlated sites. By adapting the recently proposed\nadaptive sampling configuration interaction (ASCI) method as an impurity\nsolver, we enable much more efficient zero temperature DMFT simulations. The\nkey feature of the ASCI method is that it selects only the most relevant\nHilbert space degrees of freedom to describe the ground state.

Abstract: Recently, quantum Fourier transform interferometers have been demonstrated to\nallow a quantum metrological enhancement in phase sensitivity for a small\nnumber n of identical input single photons [1-3]. However, multiphoton\ndistinguishability at the detectors can play an important role from an\nexperimental point of view [4]. This raises a fundamental question: How is the\nphase sensitivity affected when the photons are completely distinguishable at\nthe detectors and therefore do not interfere? In other words, which role does\nmultiphoton interference play in these schemes? Here, we show that for small\nphase values the phase sensitivity achievable in the proposed schemes with\nindistinguishable photons is enhanced only by a constant factor with respect to\nthe case of completely distinguishable photons at the detectors. Interestingly,\nthis enhancement arises from the interference of only a polynomial number (in\nn) of the total n! multiphoton path amplitudes in the n-port interferometer.\nThese results are independent of the number n of single photons and of the\nphase weight factors employed at each interferometer channel. \n\n"}

In particular, gate-based\ndispersive sensing has been proposed as the readout mechanism for future\ntopological qubits, which can be measured by single electrons tunneling through\nzero-energy modes. The development of such a readout requires resolving the\ncoherent charge tunneling amplitude from a quantum dot in a Majorana-zero-mode\nhost system faithfully on short time scales. Here, we demonstrate rapid\nsingle-shot detection of a coherent single-electron tunneling amplitude between\nInAs nanowire quantum dots. We have realized a sensitive dispersive detection\ncircuit by connecting a sub-GHz, lumped element microwave resonator to a\nhigh-lever arm gate on one of dots. The resulting large dot-resonator coupling\nleads to an observed dispersive shift that is of the order of the resonator\nlinewidth at charge degeneracy.

This alternate prescription to obtain the aberration expansion is\napplied to the axially symmetric graded index fiber. This results in the\nwavelength-dependent modifications of the paraxial behaviour and the aberration\ncoefficients. Furthermore it predicts a wavelength-dependent image rotation. In\nthe low wavelength limit our formalism reproduces the Lie algebraic formalism\nof optics. The Foldy-Wouthuysen technique employed by us is ideally suited for\nthe Lie algebraic approach to optics. The present study further strengthens the\nclose analogy between the various prescription of light and charged-particle\noptics.

Abstract: It has long been known that to minimise the heat emitted by a deterministic\ncomputer during it's operation it is necessary to make the computation act in a\nlogically reversible manner\\cite{Lan61}. Such logically reversible operations\nrequire a number of auxiliary bits to be stored, maintaining a history of the\ncomputation, and which allows the initial state to be reconstructed by running\nthe computation in reverse. These auxiliary bits are wasteful of resources and\nmay require a dissipation of energy for them to be reused. A simple procedure\ndue to Bennett\\cite{Ben73} allows these auxiliary bits to be \"tidied\", without\ndissipating energy, on a classical computer. All reversible classical\ncomputations can be made tidy in this way. However, this procedure depends upon\na classical operation (\"cloning\") that cannot be generalised to quantum\ncomputers\\cite{WZ82}. Quantum computations must be logically reversible, and\ntherefore produce auxiliary qbits during their operation. We show that there\nare classes of quantum computation for which Bennett's procedure cannot be\nimplemented. For some of these computations there may exist another method for\nwhich the computation may be \"tidied\". However, we also show there are quantum\ncomputations for which there is no possible method for tidying the auxiliary\nqbits. Not all reversible quantum computations can be made \"tidy\".

We point out the somewhat surprising fact that decoherence\ncan be useful, indeed necessary, for practical quantum computation, in\nparticular, for the effective erasure of quantum memory in order to initialize\nthe state of the quantum computer. The essential point behind the deleter is\nthat the environment, by means of a dissipative interaction, furnishes a\ncontractive map towards a pure state. We present a specific example of an\namplitude damping channel provided by a two-level system's interaction with its\nenvironment in the weak Born-Markov approximation. This is contrasted with a\npurely dephasing, non-dissipative channel provided by a two-level system's\ninteraction with its environment by means of a quantum nondemolition\ninteraction. We point out that currently used state preparation techniques, for\nexample using optical pumping, essentially perform as quantum deleters. \n\n"}

Abstract: In loving memory of Asher Peres, we discuss a most important and influential\npaper written in 1935 by his thesis supervisor and mentor Nathan Rosen,\ntogether with Albert Einstein and Boris Podolsky. In that paper, the trio known\nas EPR questioned the completeness of quantum mechanics. The authors argued\nthat the then-new theory should not be considered final because they believed\nit incapable of describing physical reality. The epic battle between Einstein\nand Bohr intensified following the latter's response later the same year. Three\ndecades elapsed before John S. Bell gave a devastating proof that the EPR\nargument was fatally flawed. The modest purpose of our paper is to give a\ncritical analysis of the original EPR paper and point out its logical\nshortcomings in a way that could have been done 70 years ago, with no need to\nwait for Bell's theorem. We also present an overview of Bohr's response in the\ninterest of showing how it failed to address the gist of the EPR argument. \n\n"}
