It is based on a microscopic model for pion production\noff the nucleon that, besides the dominant Delta pole contribution, takes into\naccount the effect of background terms required by chiral symmetry. Moreover,\nthe model uses a reduced nucleon-to-Delta resonance axial coupling, which leads\nto coherent pion production cross sections around a factor two smaller than\nmost of the previous theoretical estimates. In the coherent production, the\nmain nuclear effects, namely medium corrections on the Delta propagator and the\nfinal pion distortion, are included. We have improved on previous similar\nmodels by taking into account the nucleon motion and employing a more\nsophisticated optical potential. As found in previous calculations the\nmodification of the Delta self-energy inside the nuclear medium strongly\nreduces the cross section, while the final pion distortion mainly shifts the\npeak position to lower pion energies. The angular distribution profiles are not\nmuch affected by nuclear effects. Nucleon motion increases the cross section by\n15% at neutrino energies of 650 MeV, while Coulomb effects on charged pions are\nestimated to be small.

Generally when people\nhave considered large new instruments such as Hanohano and LENA, they have\nabandoned the possibility of doing useful measurements with higher energy\nneutrino interactions since these produce enough light to illuminate every\nphotomultiplier tube, and the scintillation light is isotropic. Here we take\ninto account Fermat's principle, which tells us that indeed the first light to\nreach the PMTs will be on or near the lightcone, the \"Fermat surface\", and that\ndirectional track information is available.

In addition to the physics justification there are practical issues\nregarding the existing infrastructure at Homestake, and the stress\ncharacteristics of the Homestake rock formations.\n  The depth requirements associated with the various physics processes are\nreported for water Cherenkov and liquid argon detector technologies. While some\nof these physics processes can be adequately studied at shallower depths, none\nof them require a depth greater than 4300 mwe which corresponds to the 4850 ft\nlevel at Homestake. It is very important to note that the scale of the planned\ndetector is such that even for accelerator neutrino detection (which allows one\nto use the accelerator duty factor to eliminate cosmics) a minimum depth is\nneeded to reduce risk of contamination from cosmic rays. After consideration of\nthe science and the practical issues regarding the Homestake site, we strongly\nrecommend that the geotechnical studies be commenced at the 4850ft level in a\ntimely manner. \n\n"}

The physics\nprogramme is devoted to an exploration of the energy frontier, complementing\nthe LHC and its discovery potential for physics beyond the Standard Model with\nhigh precision deep inelastic scattering measurements. These are designed to\ninvestigate a variety of fundamental questions in strong and electroweak\ninteractions. The physics programme also includes electron-deuteron and\nelectron-ion scattering in a $(Q^2, 1/x)$ range extended by four orders of\nmagnitude as compared to previous lepton-nucleus DIS experiments for novel\ninvestigations of neutron's and nuclear structure, the initial conditions of\nQuark-Gluon Plasma formation and further quantum chromodynamic phenomena. The\nLHeC may be realised either as a ring-ring or as a linac-ring collider. Optics\nand beam dynamics studies are presented for both versions, along with technical\ndesign considerations on the interaction region, magnets and further\ncomponents, together with a design study for a high acceptance detector. Civil\nengineering and installation studies are presented for the accelerator and the\ndetector. The LHeC can be built within a decade and thus be operated while the\nLHC runs in its high-luminosity phase. It thus represents a major opportunity\nfor progress in particle physics exploiting the investment made in the LHC. \n\n"}

In such a scenario, while the stau is the\nnext-to-lightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP), the charginos and the other\nneutralinos as well as sleptons of the first two families are also likely to be\nnot too far above the mass bounds laid down by the Large Electron Positron\n(LEP) collider. As the branching ratios of decays of the charginos and the\nnext-to-lightest neutralino into staus are rather large, one expects\nsignificant rates of tau-rich final states in such a case. With this in view,\nwe investigate the same-sign ditau and tri-tau signals of this scenario at the\nLarge Hadron Collider (LHC) for two MSSM benchmark points corresponding to\nlight neutralino dark matter. The associated signal rates for these channels\nare computed, for the centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV. We find that both\nchannels lead to appreciable rates if the squarks and the gluino are not too\nfar above a TeV, thus allowing to probe scenarios with light neutralinos in the\n14 TeV LHC run with 10-100 fb^{-1}. \n\n"}

The\ninterference contribution to the new physics signal, currently not fully taken\ninto account by experimental collaborations in Z'-searches and in the\ninterpretation of the results, can be substantial.

As the Z'-boson interference is\nmodel-dependent, a proper treatment would a priori require a dedicated\nexperimental analysis for each particular model. Doing so could potentially\nimprove the sensitivity to new physics, but would require significantly more\nexperimental effort.\n  At the same time, it is shown that one can define an invariant mass window,\nvalid for a wide range of models, for which the contribution of the\nmodel-dependent interference to the Beyond the Standard Model signal is reduced\nto O(10%), comparable to the level of the combined uncertainty from parton\ndensities and higher order corrections. This quasi-model-independent \"magic\ncut\" does not scale with the mass of the Z'-boson and is approximately constant\nover a large range of masses.

The energies of charged particles\ncan then be extracted from precise inner detector tracker measurements, whilst\nphoton energies will be measured in the ECAL, and only neutral hadron energies\n(10% of jet energies) will be measured in the HCAL, largely avoiding the\ntypically poor HCAL resolution.\n  This document introduces the Pandora particle flow algorithms, which offer\nthe current state of the art in particle flow calorimetry for the ILC and CLIC.\nThe performance of the algorithms is investigated by examining the\nreconstructed jet energy resolution and the ability to separate the hadronic\ndecays of W and Z bosons. \n\n"}

At hadron colliders the dominant\nfraction of hits is due to low momentum tracks for which multiple scattering\n(MS) effects dominate the hit resolution. MS is also the dominating source for\nhit confusion and track uncertainties in low energy precision experiments. In\nall such environments, where MS dominates, track reconstruction and fitting can\nbe largely simplified by using three-dimensional (3D) hit-triplets as provided\nby pixel detectors. This simplification is possible since track uncertainties\nare solely determined by MS if high precision spatial information is provided.\nFitting of hit-triplets is especially simple for tracking detectors in\nsolenoidal magnetic fields. The over-constrained 3D-triplet method provides a\ncomplete set of track parameters and is robust against fake hit combinations.\nThe triplet method is ideally suited for pixel detectors where hits can be\ntreated as 3D-space points.

This is an\nimportant step in the development of meter-scale light guides for future\nLArTPCs. Improvements come from using a new acrylic-based coating,\ndiamond-polished cast UV transmitting acrylic bars, and a hand-dipping\ntechnique to coat the bars. We discuss a model for connecting bar response in\nair to response in liquid argon and compare this to data taken in liquid argon.\nThe good agreement between the prediction of the model and the measured\nresponse in liquid argon demonstrates that characterization in air is\nsufficient for quality control of bar production. This model can be used in\nsimulations of light guides for future experiments. \n\n"}

In measurements of\nthe basic weak muon capture reaction on the proton to determine the\npseudoscalar coupling g_P, capture occurs from both atomic and molecular\nstates. Thus knowledge of \\lambda_pp\\mu\\ is required for a correct\ninterpretation of these experiments.\n  Purpose: Recently the MuCap experiment has measured the capture rate\n\\Lambda_S from the singlet p\\mu\\ atom, employing a low density active target to\nsuppress pp\\mu\\ formation (PRL 110, 12504 (2013)). Nevertheless, given the\nunprecedented precision of this experiment, the existing experimental knowledge\nin \\lambda_pp\\mu\\ had to be improved.\n  Method: The MuCap experiment derived the weak capture rate from the muon\ndisappearance rate in ultra-pure hydrogen. By doping the hydrogen with 20 ppm\nof argon, a competing process to pp\\mu\\ formation was introduced, which allowed\nthe extraction of \\lambda_pp\\mu\\ from the observed time distribution of decay\nelectrons.\n  Results: The pp\\mu\\ formation rate was measured as \\lambda_pp\\mu = (2.01 +-\n0.06(stat) +- 0.03(sys)) 10^6 s^-1. This result updates the \\lambda_pp\\mu\\\nvalue used in the above mentioned MuCap publication.\n  Conclusions: The 2.5x higher precision compared to earlier experiments and\nthe fact that the measurement was performed at nearly identical conditions to\nthe main data taking, reduces the uncertainty induced by \\lambda_pp\\mu\\ to a\nminor contribution to the overall uncertainty of \\Lambda_S and g_P, as\ndetermined in MuCap. Our final value for \\lambda_pp\\mu\\ shifts \\Lambda_S and\ng_P by less than one tenth of their respective uncertainties compared to our\nresults published earlier. \n\n"}

In particular, for a decay to N visible particles, one considers\nthe sorted sets of all possible n-body invariant mass combinations (2 <= n <=\nN) and determines the kinematic endpoint m_(n,r)^max of the distribution of the\nr-th largest n-body invariant mass m_(n,r) for each possible value of n and r.\nFor the classic example of a squark decay in supersymmetry, we provide\nanalytical formulas for the interpretation of these endpoints in terms of the\nunderlying physical masses.

Unexpected discoveries, such as the\ndiphoton excess F(750 GeV) seen at the LHC, could strongly motivate the\nconstruction of a photon collider. In order to enable the gamma-gamma collision\noption, the ILC design should be compatible with it from the very beginning. In\nthis paper, we discuss the problem of the beam crossing angle. In the ILC\ntechnical design, this angle is 14 mrad, which is just enough to provide enough\nspace for the final quadrupoles and outgoing beams. For gamma-gamma collisions,\nthe crossing angle must be larger because the low-energy electrons that result\nfrom multiple Compton scattering get large disruption angles in collisions with\nthe opposing electron beam and some deflection in the solenoidal detector\nfield. For a 2E=500 GeV collider, the required crossing angle is about 25 mrad.\nIn this paper, we consider the factors that determine the crossing angle as\nwell as its minimum permissible value that does not yet cause a considerable\nreduction of the gamma-gamma luminosity.

In many modern\nexperiments, large calorimeter systems play a central role, and this is\nexpected to be no different for experiments that are currently being\nplanned/designed for future accelerators. In this paper, the state of the art\nas well as new developments in calorimetry are reviewed. The latter are of\ncourse inspired by the perceived demands of future experiments, and/or the\nincreasing demands of the current generation of experiments, as these are\nconfronted with, for example, increased luminosity. These demands depend on the\nparticles to be detected by the calorimeter. In electromagnetic calorimeters,\nradiation hardness of the detector components is a major concern. The generally\npoor performance of the current generation of hadron calorimeters is considered\ninadequate for future experiments, and a lot of the R&D in the past decade has\nfocused on improving this performance.

In\nhigh-energy p-pbar collisions, such as at the Tevatron, bottom anti-bottom\nproduction can be schematically categorized into three mechanisms. The\nleading-order (LO) process is ``flavor creation,'' where both the bottom and\nanti-bottom quarks substantially participate in the hard scattering and result\nin a distinct back-to-back signal in final state. The ``flavor excitation'' and\nthe ``gluon splitting'' processes, which appear at next-leading-order (NLO),\nare known to make a comparable contribution to total bottom anti-bottom cross\nsection, while providing very different opening angle distributions from the LO\nprocess. An azimuthal opening angle between bottom and anti-bottom, Delta phi,\nhas been used for the correlation measurement to probe the interaction creating\nbottom anti-bottom pairs. The Delta phi distribution has been obtained from two\ndifferent methods. One method measures the Delta phi between bottom hadrons\nusing events with two reconstructed secondary vertex tags. The other method\nuses b-bbar --> (J/psi X)(l X') events, where the charged lepton (l) is an\nelectron or a muon, to measure Delta phi between bottom quarks. The bottom\nanti-bottom purity is determined as a function of Delta phi by fitting the\ndecay length of the J/psi and the impact parameter of the lepton. Both methods\nquantify the contribution from higher-order production mechanisms by the\nfraction of the b-bbar pairs produced in the same azimuthal hemisphere,\nf_toward.

This is done with the help of a model with an\nexpansion in inverse powers of the number of colors, Nc, allowing us to\nconsider resonances with a finite width. Due to these duality violations, the\nOperator Product Expansion (OPE) and the moments of the spectral function (e.g.\nthe Weinberg sum rules) do not match at finite momentum, and we analyze this\ndifference in detail. We also perform a comparative study of many of the\ndifferent methods proposed in the literature for the extraction of the OPE\nparameters and find that, when applied to our model, they all fare quite\nsimilarly. In fact, the model strongly suggests that a significant improvement\nin precision can only be expected after duality violations are included. To\nthis end, we propose a method to parameterize these duality violations. The\nmethod works quite well for the model, and we hope that it may also be useful\nin future determinations of OPE parameters in QCD. \n\n"}

We report on tests of\nlead tungstate crystals, read out by photomultiplier tubes, exposed to\nirradiation by monoenergetic electron or pion beams. The beam electrons\nthemselves were used to measure the scintillation light output, and a blue\nlight emitting diode (LED) was used to track variations of crystals\ntransparency. We report on the correlation of the LED measurement with\nradiation damage by the beams and also show that it can accurately monitor the\ncrystals recovery from such damage. \n\n"}

With L = 100 fb^-1 at\nsqrt(s) = 350 GeV a relative error of around 10^{-4} is possible. The\npotentially largest systematic uncertainty comes from the knowledge of the\naspect ratio of the detector. \n\n"}
