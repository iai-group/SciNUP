Two complementary approaches are therefore\nintroduced, appropriate to low and high temperatures, which point to the same\nordered pattern.

An additional puzzle is the unknown connection between the\nsuperconducting gap and the so-called pseudogap which is a central property of\nthe most unusual normal state. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy\n(ARPES) measurements have revealed a gap-like behavior on parts of the Fermi\nsurface, leaving a non-gapped segment known as Fermi arc around the diagonal of\nthe Brillouin zone. Starting from the $t$-$J$ model, in this paper we present a\nmicroscopic approach to investigate physical properties of the pseudogap phase\nin the framework of a novel renormalization scheme called PRM. This approach is\nbased on a stepwise elimination of high-energy transitions using unitary\ntransformations. We arrive at a renormalized 'free' Hamiltonian for correlated\nelectrons. The ARPES spectral function along the Fermi surface turns out to be\nin good agreement with experiment: We find well-defined excitation peaks around\n$\\omega=0$ near the nodal direction, which become strongly suppressed around\nthe antinodal point. The origin of the pseudogap can be traced back to a\nsuppression of spectral weight from incoherent excitations in a small\n$\\omega$-range around the Fermi energy.

Here, special\nfocus is placed on the critical evaluation of the spin-triplet, odd-parity\npairing scenario applied to Sr2RuO4. After an introduction to superconductors\nwith possible odd-parity pairing, accumulated evidence for the pairing symmetry\nof Sr2RuO4 is examined. Then, significant recent progress on the theoretical\napproaches to the superconducting pairing by Coulomb repulsion is reviewed. A\nsection is devoted to some experimental properties of Sr2RuO4 that seem to defy\nsimple explanations in terms of currently available spin-triplet scenario.

We show that several quantum phase transitions (QPT) occur in such a\nmodel, transitions which emulate those found in interacting systems such as\nLuttinger liquids or Kondo systems.

For strong dissipation, a Berezinsky-Kosterlitz-Thouless QPT separates\nstrong-coupling and weak-coupling (charge localized) phases. In the\nsource-drain symmetric case, all relevant backscattering processes disappear at\nstrong coupling, leading to perfect transmission at zero temperature.

The challenge lies in\nreconciling the two basic experimental features of their superconducting state:\na node-less gap and the existence of a resonance in the spin excitation\nspectrum.

In\npractise this degeneracy is never exact, and the magnitude of the ground-state\ndegeneracy splitting imposes constraints on the timescales over which\ninformation is topologically protected. In this Letter we use an instanton\napproach to evaluate the splitting of topological ground-state degeneracy in\nquasi-1D systems with parafermion zero modes, in the specific case where\nparafermions are realized by inducing a superconducting gap in pairs of\nfractional quantum Hall edges.

These models are the Ising chain with\nanti-ferromagnetic long-range interactions that decay with distance $r$ as\n$1/r^\\alpha$, as well as a related class of fermionic Hamiltonians that\ngeneralise the Kitaev chain, where both the hopping and pairing terms are\nlong-range and their relative strength can be varied. For these models, we\nprovide the phase diagram for all exponents $\\alpha$, based on an analysis of\nthe entanglement entropy, the decay of correlation functions, and the edge\nmodes in the case of open chains. We demonstrate that violations of the area\nlaw can occur for $\\alpha \\lesssim1$, while connected correlation functions can\ndecay with a hybrid exponential and power-law behaviour, with a power that is\n$\\alpha$-dependent. Interestingly, for the fermionic models we provide an exact\nanalytical derivation for the decay of the correlation functions at every\n$\\alpha$.

For this purpose, we apply\ntwo different nonperturbative approaches, consisting in the sum of ladder\ndiagrams and taking the limit of a large number N of fermion flavors.

The presented logic uses fluxons, topological solitons in Long\nJosephson Junctions (LJJs), as inputs into and outputs from logic gates. An\nadvantage of using LJJs for connections is that they restrict scattering to 1D\npaths, in contrast to previous ballistic logic which is based on 2D scattering.\nFurthermore, we find through simulation that there is almost no energy loss in\nthe scattering of fluxons between LJJs of designed unpowered circuit gates. To\nswitch bit states, the fluxons are made to change polarity during operations --\nfluxons in an input LJJ freely propagate into the gate circuit, excite a\nnonlinear oscillatory interface mode, and quickly scatter deterministically to\nan output LJJ as a fluxon or antifluxon.

There is evidence of a vortex liquid in the latter phase, in\nwhich the pairing responsible for superconductivity still exists, but\nsuperconductivity itself does not.

Such feedback features are studied on the basis of the flow equation\ntechnique - an infinite series of infinitesimal unitary transformations - which\nleads to a gradual elimination of the inter-subsystem interaction. As a result\nthe two subsystems get decoupled but their renormalized kinetic energies become\nmutually dependent on each other. Choosing for the inter - subsystem\ninteraction a charge exchange term (the Boson-Fermion model) the initially\nlocalized Bosons acquire itinerancy through their dependence on the\nrenormalized Fermion dispersion.

The width of such a resonancelike peak in momentum space decides\na spin correlation length scale which is inversely proportional to the square\nroot of doping concentration, while the energy of the resonancelike peak scales\nlinearly with the doping concentration at low doping. An important prediction\nof the theory is that, while the total spin sum rule is satisfied at different\ndoping concentrations, the weight of the resonancelike peak does not vanish,\nbut is continuously saturated to the weight of the AFLRO at zero-doping limit.\nBesides the low-energy resonancelike peak, we also show that the high-energy\nexcitations still track the spin wave dispersion in momentum space,\ncontributing to a significant portion of the total spin sum rule. The\nfluctuational effect beyond the mean-field theory is also examined, which is\nrelated to the broadening of the resonancelike peak in energy space. In\nparticular, we discuss the incommensurability of the spin dynamics by pointing\nout that its visibility is strongly tied to the low-energy fluctuations below\nthe resonancelike peak.

Recently XXX spin chain was discussed in\nrelation to the information theory. We consider here localizable entanglement,\nintroduced recently by F.Verstraete, M.Popp and J.I.Cirac. That is how much\nentanglement can be localized on two spins on average by performing local\nmeasurements on the other individual spins in a system of many interacting\nspins. We consider the ground state in antiferromagnetic spin chains and study\nlocalizable entanglement between two spins as a function of the distance. We\nstart with isotropic spin chain.\n  Then we study effect of anisotropy and magnetic field. We conclude that\nanisotropy increases localizable entanglement. We found an explicit dependence\nof critical exponents in XXZ spin chain on magnetic field. We discovered that\nthe cases of high symmetry corresponds to high sensitivity of magnetic field.\nWe also calculated the concurrence before the measurement to illustrate that\nthe measurment raises the concurrence. \n\n"}

The structure of these CPT-like states\ncorresponds to Cooper pairs with the total spin $S$=1. The found states have a\nhuge degree of degeneracy and carry a macroscopic magnetic moment, that allows\nus to construct a new model of the magnetism connected with the delocalized\nelectrons in metals (conductors). A principal possibility to apply the obtained\nresults to the superfluid $^3$He is also demonstrated. \n\n"}
