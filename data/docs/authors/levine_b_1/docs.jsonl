We examine this logic\nin a simple example of scalar quantum field theory in the expanding and\ncontracting Milne universes, where wavelengths of the eigenmodes are red- or\nblue-shifted. Trans-Planckian modifications of QFT should result in a\nUV-dependent VeV of the energy momentum tensor of a scalar field in the Milne\nuniverse.

In addition\nto its nonoscillatory behavior, the Christodoulou memory is interesting because\neven though it originates from 2.5 post-Newtonian (PN) order multipole\ninteractions, it affects the waveform at leading (Newtonian/quadrupole) order.\nThe memory is also potentially detectable in binary black-hole mergers. While\nthe oscillatory pieces of the gravitational-wave polarizations for\nquasicircular, inspiralling compact binaries have been computed to 3PN order,\nthe memory contribution to the polarizations has only been calculated to\nleading order (the next-to-leading order 0.5PN term has previously been shown\nto vanish).

We find that\nincluding both the spin-spin coupling $\\sigma$ and the eccentricity $e$ into\nthe binary parameters reduces the determination accuracy by an order of\nmagnitude for the Brans-Dicke case, whilst it has less influence on massive\ngraviton theories.

The shock trigger accurately monitors the relative\ndensity slope and uses it to fine-tune the amount of artificial viscosity that\nis applied. This procedure substantially sharpens shock fronts while still\navoiding post-shock noise. If not triggered, the viscosity parameter of each\nparticle decays to zero.

The mechanisms are the breakout of the\nthermonuclear burning front as it reaches the surface of the white dwarf and\nthe interaction of the rapidly expanding envelope with an accretion disk. Based\non the delayed-detonation scenario and detailed radiation-hydro calculation\nwhich include nuclear networks, we find that both mechanisms produce ~1 second\nflashes of high energy radiation with peak luminosities of 10^48 to 10^50\nerg/sec with fast rises and exponential declines. The X- and gamma-ray\nvisibility of a SN-Ia will depend strongly on self absorption within the\nprogenitor system, specifically on the properties of the accretion disk and its\norientation towards the observer. Such X-ray and gamma-ray flashes could be\ndetected as triggered events by Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) detectors on satellites,\nwith events in current GRB catalogs. We have searched through the GRB catalogs\n(for the BATSE, HETE, and Swift experiments) for GRBs that occur at the\nextrapolated time of explosion and in the correct direction for known Type Ia\nsupernovae with radial velocity of less than 3,000 km/s.

Aligning the EOB and numerical waveforms at low frequency\nover a time interval of 1000M, we first estimate the phase and amplitude errors\nin the numerical waveforms and then minimize the difference between numerical\nand EOB waveforms by calibrating a handful of EOB-adjustable parameters. In the\nequal-mass, spin aligned case, we find that phase and fractional amplitude\ndifferences between the numerical and EOB (2,2) mode can be reduced to 0.01\nradians and 1%, respectively, over the entire inspiral waveforms. In the\nequal-mass, spin anti-aligned case, these differences can be reduced to 0.13\nradians and 1% during inspiral and plunge, and to 0.4 radians and 10% during\nmerger and ringdown. The waveform agreement is within numerical errors in the\nspin aligned case while slightly over numerical errors in the spin anti-aligned\ncase.

The primary limitation of these calculations is now\ncomputational. In particular, it is difficult to model systems with large mass\nratio and large spins, since one must accurately resolve the multiple\nlengthscales which play a role in such systems.

In this paper, we analyze images of black holes within a framework\nthat allows us to calculate observables in the electromagnetic spectrum as a\nfunction of the mass, spin, and, independently, the quadrupole moment of a\nblack hole. We show that a deviation of the quadrupole moment from the expected\nKerr value leads to images of black holes that are either prolate or oblate\ndepending on the sign and magnitude of the deviation.

At such points,\nthe adiabatic approximation to the orbital evolution breaks down, and there is\na brief but order unity correction to the inspiral rate. Corrections to the\ngravitational wave signal's phase due to resonance effects scale as the square\nroot of the inverse of mass of the small body, and thus become large in the\nextreme-mass-ratio limit, dominating over all other post-adiabatic effects. The\nresonances make orbits more sensitive to changes in initial data (though not\nquite chaotic), and are genuine non-perturbative effects that are not seen at\nany order in a standard post-Newtonian expansion.

If we can consider the entanglement entropy as thermodynamic entropy, we\ncan see the entropic force acting on the two black holes from the $r$\ndependence of $S_C$. We develop the computational method based on that of\nBombelli et al to obtain the $r$ dependence of $S_C$ of scalar fields whose\nLagrangian is quadratic with respect to the scalar fields. First we study $S_C$\nin $d+1$ dimensional Minkowski spacetime. In this case the state of the\nmassless free scalar field is the Minkowski vacuum state and we replace two\nblack holes by two imaginary spheres, and we take the trace over the degrees of\nfreedom residing in the imaginary spheres. We obtain the leading term of $S_C$\nwith respect to $1/r$. The result is $S_C=S_A+S_B+\\tfrac{1}{r^{2d-2}}\nG(R_1,R_2)$, where $S_A$ and $S_B$ are the entanglement entropy on the inside\nregion of $A$ and $B$, and $G(R_1,R_2) \\leq 0$. We do not calculate\n$G(R_1,R_2)$ in detail, but we show how to calculate it. In the black hole case\nwe use the method used in the Minkowski spacetime case with some modifications.\nWe show that $S_C$ can be expected to be the same form as that in the Minkowski\nspacetime case. But in the black hole case, $S_A$ and $S_B$ depend on $r$, so\nwe do not fully obtain the $r$ dependence of $S_C$. Finally we assume that the\nentanglement entropy can be regarded as thermodynamic entropy, and consider the\nentropic force acting on two black holes. We argue how to separate the\nentanglement entropic force from other force and how to cancel $S_A$ and $S_B$\nwhose $r$ dependence are not obtained.

The magnetospheres of moving black holes resemble in many respects the\nmagnetospheres of rotationally-powered pulsars, with pair formation fronts and\nouter gaps, where the sign of the induced charge changes.

In this paper, we develop a ray-tracing\nalgorithm to calculate the apparent surface areas of moderately spinning\nneutron stars making use of the Hartle-Thorne metric. This analytic metric\nallows us to calculate various observables of the neutron star in a way that\ndepends only on its macroscopic properties and not on the details of its\nequation of state.

Is it\npossible to discern the presence of a population of signals in the data by\ncross-correlating data from different detectors in the ET observatory?

A gravitational wave signal appears in pulsar timing\nresiduals through two components: one independent of and one dependent on the\npulsar's distance, called the 'Earth term' (ET) and 'pulsar term' (PT),\nrespectively. The signal of a burst (or transient) gravitational wave source in\npulsars' residuals will in general have the Earth and pulsar terms separated by\ntimes of the order of the time of flight from the pulsar to the Earth.\nTherefore, both terms are not observable over a realistic observation span, but\nthe ETs observed in many pulsars should be correlated. We show that pairs (or\nmore) of pulsars can be aligned in such a way that the PTs caused by a source\nat certain sky locations can arrive at Earth within a time window short enough\nto be captured during a realistic observation span. We find that for the\npulsars within the International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA) ~67 per cent of the\nsky produces such alignments for pulsars terms separated by less than 10 years.\nWe compare estimates of the source event rate that would be required to observe\none signal in the IPTA if searching for the correlated ETs, or in searching via\nthe PTs, and find that event rates would need to be about two orders of\nmagnitude higher to observe an event with the PTs than the ETs.

{"id": "1210.1041", "contents": "Title: Magnetic Penrose Process and Blanford-Zanejk mechanism: A clarification Abstract: The Penrose process (PP) is an ingenious mechanism of extracting rotational\nenergy from a rotating black hole, however it was soon realized that it was not\nvery efficient for its astrophysical applications for powering the central\nengine of quasars and AGNs. The situation however changed dramatically in the\npresence of magnetic field produced by the accretion disk surrounding the hole\nin the equatorial plane. In 1985, Wagh, Dhurandhar and Dadhich had for the\nfirst time considered the magnetic Penrose process (MPP) in which the magnetic\nfield could now provide the energy required for a fragment to ride on negative\nenergy orbit thereby overcoming the stringent velocity constraint of the\noriginal PP. Thus MPP turned very efficient and so much so that efficiency\ncould now even exceed 100 percent. They had in principle established revival of\nPP for astrophysical applications in powering the high energy sources. MPP is\nhowever similar to the earlier discovered and well known Blandford-Znajeck (BZ)\nmechanism in which the rotational energy of the hole is extracted out through a\npurely electromagnetic process. Though both the processes use magnetic field as\na device to extract rotational energy from the hole, yet their kernel is quite\ndifferent in spirit. For the former magnetic field provides the threshold\nenergy for particle to get onto negative energy orbit so that the other\nfragment goes out with enhanced energy while for the latter it generates an\nelectric potential difference between the equatorial plane and the polar\nregion, and it is the discharge of which that drives the energy flux out of the\nhole. In other words, MPP is still rooted in the spacetime geometry while BZ is\nessentially driven by electromagnetic interaction. \n\n"}

It is shown that the observed glitch\nsize distributions cannot be reproduced if superfluid vortices unpin\nindependently via a Poisson process; the central limit theorem yields a narrow\nGaussian for the size distribution, instead of the broad, power-law tail\nobserved. This conclusion is not altered fundamentally when a range of pinning\npotentials is included, which leads to excavation of the potential distribution\nof occupied sites, vortex accumulation at strong pinning sites, and hence the\noccasional, abnormally large glitch. Knock-on processes are therefore needed to\nmake the unpinning rate of a vortex conditional on the pinning state of its\nnear and/or remote neighbours, so that the Gaussian size distributions\nresulting generically from the central limit theorem are avoided. At least two\nknock-on processes, nearest- neighbour proximity knock-on and remote acoustic\nknock-on, are clearly evident in the Gross-Pitaevskii simulation output.

To this end, we perform 3D general-relativistic\nsimulations with a 3-species neutrino leakage scheme. The leakage scheme\ncaptures the essential aspects of neutrino cooling, heating, and lepton number\nexchange as predicted by radiation-hydrodynamics simulations. The 27-solar-mass\nprogenitor was studied in 2D by B. Mueller et al. (ApJ 761:72, 2012), who\nobserved strong growth of the SASI while neutrino-driven convection was\nsuppressed. In our 3D simulations, neutrino-driven convection grows from\nnumerical perturbations imposed by our Cartesian grid. It becomes the dominant\ninstability and leads to large-scale non-oscillatory deformations of the shock\nfront. These will result in strongly aspherical explosions without the need for\nlarge-scale SASI shock oscillations. Low-l-mode SASI oscillations are present\nin our models, but saturate at small amplitudes that decrease with increasing\nneutrino heating and vigor of convection.

The\ninner shell is charged, whereas the outer one is either neutral or charged. In\nthe situation we consider, the charge of the inner shell is larger than its\ngravitational mass, and the inside of it is empty and regular. Hence the domain\njust outside it is described by the overcharged Reissner-Nordstrom geometry\nwhereas the inside of it is Minkowski. First, the inner shell starts to shrink\nform infinity with finite kinetic energy, and then the outer shell starts to\nshrink from infinity with vanishing kinetic energy. The inner shell bounces on\nthe potential wall and collides with the ingoing outer shell. The energy of\ncollision between these shells at \"their center of mass frame\" does not exceed\nthe total energy of the system. By contrast, by virtue of the very large gamma\nfactor of the relative velocity of the shells, the energy of collision between\ntwo of the constituent particles of these shells at their center of mass frame\ncan be much larger than the Planck scale.

When a stellar mass object is captured by the mini-halo, it eventually\ninfalls into such an IMBH due to gravitational wave back reaction which in turn\ncould be observed directly by future space-borne gravitational wave experiments\nsuch as eLISA/NGO.

Both the persistent and transient black holes remain for long\nperiods in a state where their spectra are dominated by a thermal accretion\ndisk component. The spin of a black hole of known mass and distance can be\nmeasured by fitting this thermal continuum spectrum to the thin-disk model of\nNovikov and Thorne; the key fit parameter is the radius of the inner edge of\nthe black hole's accretion disk. Strong observational and theoretical evidence\nlinks the inner-disk radius to the radius of the innermost stable circular\norbit, which is trivially related to the dimensionless spin parameter a_* of\nthe black hole (|a_*| < 1).

Even though one\nmight expect a background composed of a high-redshift cosmological population\nof sources to be fairly isotropic, deviations from isotropy may be indicative\nof local GW hotspots or some form of continuous anisotropy in the\nangular-distribution of GW-power. A GWB induces time-of-arrival deviations in\npulsar signals which are correlated between separated pulsars.

{"id": "1307.2890", "contents": "Title: The stability of tidally deformed neutron stars to three- and four-mode\n  coupling Abstract: It has recently been suggested that the tidal deformation of a neutron star\nexcites daughter p- and g-modes to large amplitudes via a quasi-static\ninstability. This would remove energy from the tidal bulge, resulting in\ndissipation and possibly affecting the phase evolution of inspiralling binary\nneutron stars and hence the extraction of binary parameters from gravitational\nwave observations. This instability appears to arise because of a large\nthree-mode interaction among the tidal mode and high-order p- and g-modes of\nsimilar radial wavenumber. We show that additional four-mode interactions enter\ninto the analysis at the same order as the three-mode terms previously\nconsidered. We compute these four-mode couplings by finding a volume-preserving\ncoordinate transformation that relates the energy of a tidally deformed star to\nthat of a radially perturbed spherical star. Using this method, we relate the\nfour-mode coupling to three-mode couplings and show that there is a near-exact\ncancellation between the destabilizing effect of the three-mode interactions\nand the stabilizing effect of the four-mode interaction. We then show that the\nequilibrium tide is stable against the quasi-static decay into daughter p- and\ng-modes to leading order. The leading deviation from the quasi-static\napproximation due to orbital motion of the binary is considered; while it may\nslightly spoil the near-cancellation, any resulting instability timescale is at\nleast of order the gravitational-wave inspiral time. We conclude that the\np-/g-mode coupling does not lead to a quasi-static instability, and does not\nimpact the phase evolution of gravitational waves from binary neutron stars. \n\n"}

Indeed the\ngravitational field should depend on the relative contribution of the particle\ndark matter distribution to the baryonic one, itself depending on the\nindividual assembly history and environment of the galaxy, including a lot of\ncomplex feedback mechanisms. However, for the last thirty years, Milgrom's\nformula, at the heart of the MOND paradigm, has been consistently succesful at\npredicting rotation curves from baryons alone, and has been resilient to all\nsorts of observational tests on galaxy scales. We show that the few individual\ngalaxy rotation curves that have been claimed to be highly problematic for the\npredictions of Milgrom's formula, such as Holmberg II or NGC 3109, are actually\nfalse alarms.

In particular, it is important to\ndescribe properly light propagation through the Solar System. For two decades,\nseveral modeling efforts based on the solution of the null geodesic equations\nhave been proposed but they are mainly valid only for the first order\nPost-Newtonian approximation. However, with the increasing precision of ongoing\nspace missions as Gaia, GAME, BepiColombo, JUNO or JUICE, we know that some\ncorrections up to the second order have to be taken into account for future\nexperiments. We present a procedure to compute the relativistic coordinate time\ndelay, Doppler and astrometric observables avoiding the integration of the null\ngeodesic equation. This is possible using the Time Transfer Function formalism,\na powerful tool providing key quantities such as the time of flight of a light\nsignal between two point-events and the tangent vector to its null-geodesic.\nIndeed we show how to compute the Time Transfer Functions and their derivatives\n(and thus range, Doppler and astrometric observables) up to the second\npost-Minkowskian order.

Similarly, a sudden or\na type IV singularity in GR can be replaced in some regions of the parameter\nspace by a type IV singularity or a loitering behaviour, respectively, in the\nEiBI framework.

As\nmatter models we consider the case of a pressureless perfect fluid, i.e. dust,\nand the case of a real massive scalar field oscillating around the minimum of\nthe potential. Both types of matter have been considered as possible dark\nmatter candidates in the cosmology literature, dust being closely related to\nthe standard cold dark matter paradigm. We confirm that in the linear regime\nthe perturbations associated with these types of matter grow in essentially the\nsame way, the main difference being that in the case of a scalar field the\ndynamics introduce a cut-off in the power spectrum of the density perturbations\nat scales comparable with the Compton wavelength of the field. We also follow\nthe evolutions well beyond the linear regime showing that both models are able\nto form structure.

How the mechanism producing EM emission is related to any continuous\ngravitational-wave (CW) emission is unknown; if they either interact or are\nlocked in phase then the CW will also experience timing noise. Any disparity\nbetween the signal and the search template used in matched filtering methods\nwill result in a loss of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), referred to as\n`mismatch'.

But when\nNewton's constant is small relative to the AdS scale, the former holds to good\napproximation even for classical perturbations that contain many quanta.

Bitcoin nodes continuously generate and propagate\nblocks---collections of newly approved transactions that are added to Bitcoin's\nledger. Block creation requires nodes to invest computational resources, but\nalso carries a reward in the form of bitcoins that are paid to the creator.\nWhile the protocol requires nodes to quickly distribute newly created blocks,\nstrong nodes can in fact gain higher payoffs by withholding blocks they create\nand selectively postponing their publication. The existence of such selfish\nmining attacks was first reported by Eyal and Sirer, who have demonstrated a\nspecific deviation from the standard protocol (a strategy that we name SM1).\n  In this paper we extend the underlying model for selfish mining attacks, and\nprovide an algorithm to find $\\epsilon$-optimal policies for attackers within\nthe model, as well as tight upper bounds on the revenue of optimal policies. As\na consequence, we are able to provide lower bounds on the computational power\nan attacker needs in order to benefit from selfish mining. We find that the\nprofit threshold -- the minimal fraction of resources required for a profitable\nattack -- is strictly lower than the one induced by the SM1 scheme. Indeed, the\npolicies given by our algorithm dominate SM1, by better regulating\nattack-withdrawals.\n  Using our algorithm, we show that Eyal and Sirer's suggested countermeasure\nto selfish mining is slightly less effective than previously conjectured. Next,\nwe gain insight into selfish mining in the presence of communication delays,\nand show that, under a model that accounts for delays, the profit threshold\nvanishes, and even small attackers have incentive to occasionally deviate from\nthe protocol. We conclude with observations regarding the combined power of\nselfish mining and double spending attacks. \n\n"}

Multiple Gaussian fits are applied to examine the HVFs and\ntheir evolutions, using constraints on expansion velocities for the same\nspecies (i.e., SiII 5972 and SiII 6355).

This\ndifference can be due to that the HVFs in fast-expanding SNe Ia usually\ndisappear more rapidly and are easily blended with the photospheric components\nwhen approaching the maximum light. Moreover, SNe Ia with both stronger HVFs at\nearly phases and larger Vsi are found to have noticeably redder B-V colors and\noccur preferentially in the inner regions of their host galaxies, while those\nwith stronger HVFs but smaller Vsi show opposite tendencies, suggesting that\nthese two subclasses have different explosion environments and their HVFs may\nhave different origins.

Here we report on the\nextensive multi-wavelength observations of Mrk 421 over 4.5 years, from 2008\nAugust to 2013 February.

In particular, thanks to the ARGO-YBJ and $Fermi$ data, the\nwhole energy range from 100 MeV to 10 TeV is covered without any gap.\n  According to the observed light curves, ten states (including seven large\nflares, two quiescent phases and one outburst) were selected. For the first\ntime, the multi-wavelength spectral evolutions of Mrk 421 during different\nstates were systematically analyzed. During the outburst phase and the seven\nflaring episodes, the peak energy in X-rays is observed to increase from\nsub-keV to few keV. The TeV $\\gamma$-ray flux increases up to 0.9$-$7.2 times\nthe flux of the Crab Nebula. The behavior of GeV $\\gamma$-rays is found to vary\ndepending on the flare, a feature that leads us to classify flares into three\ngroups according to the GeV flux variation. Finally, the observed radiation\nspectra above 0.3 keV of different states can be reasonably described by a\nsimple one-zone synchrotron self-Compton model. The underlying physical\nmechanisms responsible for different states may be related to the acceleration\nprocess or to variations of the ambient medium. \n\n"}

Mass and spin are the first two\nmultipole moments of the Kerr spacetime and completely determine all\nhigher-order moments. The no-hair theorem and, hence, general relativity can be\ntested by measuring potential deviations from the Kerr metric affecting such\nhigher-order moments. Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) is a prime target for precision\ntests of general relativity with several experiments across the electromagnetic\nspectrum. First, near-infrared (NIR) monitoring of stars orbiting around Sgr A*\nwith current and new instruments is expected to resolve their orbital\nprecessions. Second, timing observations of radio pulsars near the Galactic\ncenter may detect characteristic residuals induced by the spin and quadrupole\nmoment of Sgr A*.

With this, we\nseparately discuss three situations: (i) a CCSN at the Galactic Center, (ii) an\nextremely nearby CCSN within hundreds of parsecs, and (iii) a CCSN in nearby\ngalaxies within several Mpc. These distance regimes necessitate different\nstrategies for synergistic observations. In a Galactic CCSN, neutrinos provide\nstrategic timing and pointing information. We explore how these in turn deliver\nan improvement in the sensitivity of GW analyses and help to guarantee\nobservations of early electromagnetic signals.

Particularly, the first model unifies the late and early-time\nacceleration with the matter domination era, and the second model unifies all\nthe evolution eras of our Universe. The two models are described in the same\nway at early and late times, and only the intermediate stages of the evolution\nhave some differences. Each cosmological model contains two Type IV\nsingularities which are chosen to occur one at the end of the inflationary era\nand one at the end of the matter domination era. The cosmological models at\nearly times are approximately identical to the $R^2$ inflation model, so these\ndescribe a slow-roll inflationary era which ends when the slow-roll parameters\nbecome of order one. The inflationary era is followed by the radiation era and\nafter that the matter domination era follows, which lasts until the second Type\nIV singularity, and then the late-time acceleration era follows. The models\nproduce a nearly scale invariant power spectrum of primordial curvature\nperturbations and a scalar-to-tensor ratio which are compatible with the most\nrecent observational data and it seems that the deceleration acceleration\ntransition is crucially affected by the presence of the second Type IV\nsingularity which occurs at the end of the matter domination era.

Then, we work out the proper\nviability conditions to guarantee in the scalar sector the absence of ghosts,\ngradient and tachyonic instabilities. The absence of ghosts can be achieved by\ndemanding a positive kinetic matrix, while the lack of a gradient instability\nis ensured by imposing a positive speed of propagation for all the scalar\nmodes. In case of tachyonic instability, the mass eigenvalues have been studied\nand we work out the appropriate expressions.

We\nperform a suite of 3D MHD AMR simulations of AGN feedback in a cool core\ncluster including cosmic ray (CR) physics. CRs are supplied to the ICM via\ncollimated AGN jets and subsequently disperse in the magnetized ICM via\nstreaming, and interact with the ICM via hadronic, Coulomb, and streaming\ninstability heating. We find that CR transport is an essential model ingredient\nneeded for AGN feedback to self-regulate, at least within the context of the\nphysical model considered here. When CR streaming is neglected, the suppression\nof CR mixing with the ICM by magnetic fields significantly reduces ICM heating,\nwhich leads to cooling catastrophes. In the opposite case, CRs come into\ncontact with the ambient ICM and efficiently heat it, which results in globally\nstable atmospheres. Moreover, the dynamical state and intermittency of the\ncentral AGN are dramatically altered when CR streaming is present. We find that\nCR streaming heating dominates over the heating due to Coulomb and hadronic\nprocesses. Importantly, in simulations that include CR streaming, CR pressure\nsupport in the central 100 kpc is very low and does not demonstrably violate\nobservational constraints. On the contrary, when CR streaming is neglected, CR\nenergy is not spent on the ICM heating and CR pressure builds up to the level\nthat is in disagreement with the data. Overall, our models demonstrate that CR\nheating is a viable channel for the thermalization of AGN energy in clusters,\nand likely also in elliptical galaxies, and that CRs play an important role in\ndetermining AGN intermittency and the dynamical state of cool core atmospheres. \n\n"}

In this article I\nshow that the glitch-events observed in pulsars are exact quantum signatures\nfor their metamorphosis into dark super-baryons (SBs), whose interiors are made\nof purely incompressible superconducting gluon-quark superfluids. Here the\nquantum nuclear shell model is adopted to describe the permitted energy levels\nof the SB, which are assumed to be identical to the discrete spinning rates\n$\\Omega_{SB},$ that SBs are allowed to rotate with. Accordingly, a glitch-event\ncorresponds to a prompt spin-down of the superconducting SB from one energy\nlevel to the next, thereby expelling a certain number of vortices, which in\nturn spins-up the ambient medium. The process is provoked mainly by the\nnegative torque of the ambient dissipative nuclear fluid and by a universal\nscalar field $\\phi$ at the background of a supranuclear dense matter. As\ndictated by the Onsager-Feynman equation, the prompt spin-down must be\nassociated with increase of the dimensions of the embryonic SB to finally\nconvert the entire pulsar into SB-Objects on the scale of Gyrs. Based on our\ncalculations, a Vela-like pulsar should display billions of glitches during its\nlifetime, before it metamorphoses entirely into a maximally compact SB-object\nand disappears from our observational windows.

The matter content of the Universe is assumed to\nconsist of the inflationary scalar field, which, through its decay, generates\nrelativistic matter, and pressureless dark matter, respectively. At the early\nstages of reheating the inflationary scalar field transfers its energy to the\nnewly created matter particles, with the field energy decreasing to near zero.\nThe general equations governing the irreversible matter creation during\nreheating are obtained by combining the thermodynamics description of the\nmatter creation and the gravitational field equations. A dimensionless form of\nthe general system of the reheating equations is also introduced. The role of\nthe different inflationary scalar field potentials is analyzed by using\nanalytical and numerical methods, and the evolution of the matter and scalar\nfield densities, as well as of the cosmological parameters during reheating,\nare obtained. Typically, the values of the energy densities of relativistic\nmatter and dark matter reach their maximum when the Universe is reheated up to\nthe reheating temperature, which is determined for each case, as a function of\nthe scalar field decay width, the scalar field particle mass, and of the\ncosmological parameters.

Our aim is to extend the kinematic analysis to\nmore general kinds of string model. We focus in particular on the collision of\nstrings described by conservative elastic string models, characteristic of\ncurrent carrying strings, and which are expected to form in a cosmological\ncontext. As opposed to Nambu-Goto strings collisions, we show that in this case\nthe collision cannot lead to the formation of a third elastic string: if\ndynamically such a string forms then the joining string must be described by a\nmore general equation of state. This process will be studied numerically in a\nforthcoming publication. \n\n"}

Recent simulations of spinning black holes and (indirect) theoretical\npredictions, suggest that a somewhat analogous effect may occur for purely\ngravitational phenomena. The magnitude and precise direction of this\n\"gravitational Magnus effect\" is still the subject of debate. Starting from the\nrigorous equations of motion for spinning bodies in General Relativity\n(Mathisson-Papapetrou equations), we show that indeed such an effect takes\nplace and is a fundamental part of the spin-curvature force. The effect arises\nwhenever there is a current of mass/energy, non-parallel to a body's spin.

It is seen to lead to\nsecular orbital precessions potentially observable by future astrometric\nexperiments and gravitational-wave detectors. Finally, we consider also the\nreciprocal problem: the \"force\" exerted by the body on the surrounding matter,\nand show that (from this perspective) the effect is due to the body's\ngravitomagnetic field.

This quantity, the effective spin\n$\\chi_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, is conserved up to at least the second post-Newtonian\norder. The measured distribution of $\\chi_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ values from a\npopulation of detected binaries, and in particular whether this distribution is\nsymmetric about zero, encodes valuable information about the underlying\ncompact-binary formation channels. In this paper we focus on two important\ncomplications of using the effective spin to study astrophysical population\nproperties: (i) an astrophysical distribution for $\\chi_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ values\nwhich is symmetric does not necessarily lead to a symmetric distribution for\nthe detected effective spin values, leading to a \\emph{selection bias}; and\n(ii) the posterior distribution of $\\chi_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ for individual events\nis \\emph{asymmetric} and it cannot usually be treated as a Gaussian.

Both purposes require us to assume some functional form\nof the ellipticity distribution, and as a proof of principle we take two toy\ndistributions.

We show here that a small\namount of Lorentz invariance violation (LIV), which could turn off photomeson\ninteractions of UHECRs with the CBR, could explain the UHECR spectrum as\nmeasured by {\\it AGASA} which shows an excess of UHECRs at energies above 100\nEeV.

A\npreliminary study of this dual theory suggests that the big crunch is an\nendpoint of evolution even in the full string theory. We also show that any\ntheory with scalar solitons must have negative energy solutions.

Here we investigate the modifications for the case of a\ncyclic universe potential, assuming that we can apply the four-dimensional loop\nquantum formalism within the effective four-dimensional theory of the cyclic\nscenario. We find that loop quantum effects can dramatically alter the\nnear-collision dynamics of the cyclic scenario.

This\nis the first of a series of papers devoted to the investigation of the Killing\nsymmetries of generalized Minkowski spaces. In particular, we discuss here the\ninfinitesimal-algebraic structure of the space-time rotations in such spaces.\nIt is shown that the maximal Killing group of these spaces is the direct\nproduct of a generalized Lorentz group and a generalized translation group. We\nderive the explicit form of the generators of the generalized Lorentz group in\nthe self-representation and their related, generalized Lorentz algebra. The\nresults obtained are specialized to the case of a 4-dimensional, ''deformed''\nMinkowski space $% \\widetilde{M_{4}}$, i.e. a pseudoeuclidean space with metric\ncoefficients depending on energy. \n\n"}

{"id": "hep-th/0605229", "contents": "Title: Quantum phantom cosmology Abstract: We apply the formalism of quantum cosmology to models containing a phantom\nfield. Three models are discussed explicitly: a toy model, a model with an\nexponential phantom potential, and a model with phantom field accompanied by a\nnegative cosmological constant. In all these cases we calculate the classical\ntrajectories in configuration space and give solutions to the Wheeler-DeWitt\nequation in quantum cosmology. In the cases of the toy model and the model with\nexponential potential we are able to solve the Wheeler-DeWitt equation exactly.\nFor comparison, we also give the corresponding solutions for an ordinary scalar\nfield. We discuss in particular the behaviour of wave packets in\nminisuperspace. For the phantom field these packets disperse in the region that\ncorresponds to the Big Rip singularity. This thus constitutes a genuine quantum\nregion at large scales, described by a regular solution of the Wheeler-DeWitt\nequation. For the ordinary scalar field, the Big-Bang singularity is avoided.\nSome remarks on the arrow of time in phantom models as well as on the relation\nof phantom models to loop quantum cosmology are given. \n\n"}

We\nsuppose that spontaneous Lorentz invariance breaking occurs in such a theory\ndue to the four-vector field taking a non-zero vacuum expectation value. Under\nsome very mild assumptions, we show that this Lorentz violation is not\nobservable and the whole theory is practically gauge invariant. A very\nimportant presupposition for this theorem is that an initial condition is\nimposed on the no-derivative expressions corresponding to the early Universe\nbeing essentially in a vacuum state. This condition then remains true forever\nand can be interpreted as a gauge constraint. We formulate the conditions under\nwhich the spontaneous Lorentz violation becomes observable. Spontaneously\nbroken Lorentz invariance could be seen by some primordially existing or\ncreated \"fossil\" charges with the property of moving through the Universe with\na fixed velocity. \n\n"}

{"id": "quant-ph/0303041", "contents": "Title: Quantum Search of Spatial Regions Abstract: Can Grover's algorithm speed up search of a physical region - for example a\n2-D grid of size sqrt(n) by sqrt(n)? The problem is that sqrt(n) time seems to\nbe needed for each query, just to move amplitude across the grid. Here we show\nthat this problem can be surmounted, refuting a claim to the contrary by\nBenioff. In particular, we show how to search a d-dimensional hypercube in time\nO(sqrt n) for d at least 3, or O((sqrt n)(log n)^(3/2)) for d=2. More\ngenerally, we introduce a model of quantum query complexity on graphs,\nmotivated by fundamental physical limits on information storage, particularly\nthe holographic principle from black hole thermodynamics. Our results in this\nmodel include almost-tight upper and lower bounds for many search tasks; a\ngeneralized algorithm that works for any graph with good expansion properties,\nnot just hypercubes; and relationships among several notions of `locality' for\nunitary matrices acting on graphs. As an application of our results, we give an\nO(sqrt(n))-qubit communication protocol for the disjointness problem, which\nimproves an upper bound of Hoyer and de Wolf and matches a lower bound of\nRazborov. \n\n"}
{"id": "quant-ph/0703064", "contents": "Title: A Topos Foundation for Theories of Physics: III. The Representation of\n  Physical Quantities With Arrows Abstract: This paper is the third in a series whose goal is to develop a fundamentally\nnew way of viewing theories of physics. Our basic contention is that\nconstructing a theory of physics is equivalent to finding a representation in a\ntopos of a certain formal language that is attached to the system. In paper II,\nwe studied the topos representations of the propositional language PL(S) for\nthe case of quantum theory, and in the present paper we do the same thing for\nthe, more extensive, local language L(S). One of the main achievements is to\nfind a topos representation for self-adjoint operators. This involves showing\nthat, for any physical quantity A, there is an arrow\n$\\breve{\\delta}^o(A):\\Sig\\map\\SR$, where $\\SR$ is the quantity-value object for\nthis theory. The construction of $\\breve{\\delta}^o(A)$ is an extension of the\ndaseinisation of projection operators that was discussed in paper II. The\nobject $\\SR$ is a monoid-object only in the topos, $\\tau_\\phi$, of the theory,\nand to enhance the applicability of the formalism, we apply to $\\SR$ a topos\nanalogue of the Grothendieck extension of a monoid to a group. The resulting\nobject, $\\kSR$, is an abelian group-object in $\\tau_\\phi$. We also discuss\nanother candidate, $\\PR{\\mathR}$, for the quantity-value object. In this\npresheaf, both inner and outer daseinisation are used in a symmetric way.\nFinally, there is a brief discussion of the role of unitary operators in the\nquantum topos scheme. \n\n"}
