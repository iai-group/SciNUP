Making a quantum expansion around such\na time dependent solution is found to break fundamental symmetries of quantum\nfield theory. We call this mechanism cosmological symmetry breaking and argue\nthat it is different from the standard phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking. We illustrate this with a toy scalar field theory, whose action\ndisplays a U(1) symmetry. We identify a symmetry, called pseudo-scale\ninvariance, which sets the cosmological constant exactly equal to zero, both in\nclassical and quantum theory. This symmetry is also broken cosmologically and\nleads to a nonzero vacuum or dark energy. The slow roll condition along with\nthe observed value of dark energy leads to a value of the background scalar\nfield of the order of Planck mass. We also consider a U(1) gauge symmetry\nmodel. Cosmological symmetry breaking, in this case, leads to a non zero mass\nfor the vector field.

In case Hubble induced A-terms are present for these two flat\ndirections, their initial values are determined completely by the potential and\nthere are no ambiguities how they are mixed. Moreover, CP is violated even when\nthe Hubble parameter is large due to the Hubble induced A-term and cross\ncoupling in F-term, so that the lepton asymmetry is generated just after the\nend of inflation. As a result, compared with the case of single flat direction,\nthe resultant lepton-to-entropy ratio is enhanced by a factor of\n$H_{osc}/m_{3/2}$, where $H_{osc}$ is the Hubble parameter at the onset of\noscillation and $m_{3/2}$ is the gravitino mass.

Therefore, CP-violation\nis not effective until the onset of the oscillation of scalar fields around the\norigin and there is suppression factor from thermal effect as is the case of\nsingle flat direction.

Afterwards, we address three important\nissues: (i) the hierarchy problem; (ii) the radion mass; and (iii) the\nlocalization of gravity, the 4-dimensional Newtonian effective potential and\nthe Yukawa corrections due to the gravitational high-order Kaluza-Klein (KK)\nmodes. With a very conservative estimation, we find that the radion mass is of\nthe order of $10^{-2} GeV$. The gravity is localized on the visible brane, and\nthe spectrum of the gravitational KK modes is discrete and can be of the order\nof TeV. The corrections to the 4-dimensional Newtonian potential from the\nhigher order of gravitational KK modes are exponentially suppressed and can be\nsafely neglected in current experiments. In an appendix, we also present a\nsystematical and pedagogical study of the Gauss-Codacci equations and Israel's\njunction conditions across a (D-1)-dimensional hypersurface, which can be\neither spacelike or timelike. \n\n"}

It has been speculated if the peak of the separation distribution of brown\ndwarf binaries lies right in the unprobed range. Very recent work for the first\ntime extends high-precision radial velocity surveys of brown dwarfs out to 3 AU\n(Joergens 2008, A&A). Based on more than six years UVES/VLT spectroscopy the\nbinary frequency of brown dwarfs and (very) low-mass stars (M4.25-M8) in ChaI\nwas determined: it is 18% for the whole sample and 10% for the subsample of ten\nbrown dwarfs and VLMS (M < 0.1 Msun). Two spectroscopic binaries were\nconfirmed, these are the brown dwarf candidate ChaHa8, and the low-mass star\nCHXR74.

Abstract: The softening process observed in the steep decay phase of early X-ray\nafterglows of Swift bursts has remained a puzzle since its discovery. The\nsoftening process can also be observed in the later phase of the bursts and its\ncause has also been unknown. Recently, it was suggested that, influenced by the\ncurvature effect, emission from high latitudes would shift the Band function\nspectrum from higher energy band to lower band, and this would give rise to the\nobserved softening process accompanied by a steep decay of the flux density.\nThe curvature effect scenario predicts that the terminating time of the\nsoftening process would be correlated with the duration of the process. In this\npaper, based on the data from the UNLV GRB group web-site, we found an obvious\ncorrelation between the two quantities. In addition, we found that the\nsoftening process can be divided into two classes: the early type softening\n($t_{s,max}\\leq \"4000\"s$) and the late type softening ($t_{s,max} > \"4000\"s$).\nThe two types of softening show different behaviors in the duration vs.\nterminating time plot. In the relation between the variation rates of the flux\ndensity and spectral index during the softening process, a discrepancy between\nthe two types of softening is also observed. According to their time scales and\nthe discrepancy between them, we propose that the two types are of different\norigins: the early type is of internal shock origin and the late type is of\nexternal shock origin. The early softening is referred to the steep decay just\nfollowing the prompt emission, whereas the late decay typically conceives the\ntransition from flat decay to late afterglow decay. We suspect that there might\nbe a great difference of the Lorentz factor in two classes which is responsible\nfor the observed discrepancy. \n\n"}

We study particular modifications of existing\nR-symmetric models which share the solution to the above problems, and have\ninteresting consequences for electroweak baryogenesis and the Dark Matter (DM)\ncontent of the universe. In particular, we find that it is naturally possible\nto have a strongly first-order electroweak phase transition while\nsimultaneously relaxing the tension with EDM experiments. The R-symmetry (and\nits small breaking) implies that the gauginos (and the neutralino LSP) are\npseudo-Dirac fermions, which is relevant for both baryogenesis and DM. The\nsinglet superpartner of the U(1)_Y pseudo-Dirac gaugino plays a prominent role\nin making the electroweak phase transition strongly first-order. The\npseudo-Dirac nature of the LSP allows it to behave similarly to a Dirac\nparticle during freeze-out, but like a Majorana particle for annihilation today\nand in scattering against nuclei, thus being consistent with current\nconstraints. Assuming a standard cosmology, it is possible to simultaneously\nhave a strongly first-order phase transition conducive to baryogenesis and have\nthe LSP provide the full DM relic abundance, in part of the allowed parameter\nspace. However, other possibilities for DM also exist, which are discussed. It\nis expected that upcoming direct DM searches as well as neutrino signals from\nDM annihilation in the Sun will be sensitive to this class of models.\nInteresting collider and Gravity-wave signals are also briefly discussed. \n\n"}

In this scenario two basic mechanisms compete,\nthe modified Hubble expansion rate tending to increase the relic density and a\ndissipative force that tends to decrease it. The net effect can lead to an\noverall dramatic decrease of the predicted relic abundance, sometimes by\namounts of the order of O(10^2) or so. This feature is rather generic,\nindependent of any particular assumption on the underlying string dynamics,\nprovided dilaton dominates at early eras after the end of inflation but before\nBig Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). The latter ensures that BBN is not upset by the\npresence of the dilaton. In this paper, within the context of such a scenario,\nwe study the phenomenology of the constrained minimal supersymmetric model\n(CMSSM) by taking into account all recent experimental constraints, including\nthose from the LHC searches.

We study this issue in detail, particularly\nfocusing on the question: \"If future observations reveal nonzero curvature,\nwhat can we conclude?\" We find that whether an observable signal arises or not\ndepends crucially on three issues: the cosmic history just before the\nobservable inflation, the measure adopted to define probabilities, and the\nnature of the correlation between the tunneling and slow-roll parts of the\npotential. We find that if future measurements find positive curvature at\n\\Omega_k < -10^-4, then the framework of the eternally inflating multiverse is\nexcluded with high significance.

Neutralino dark matter in\nnon-minimal supersymmetric models, such as the NMSSM, is an especially\nwell-motivated theoretical setup which can explain the line. We explore the\npossibility that regions of the NMSSM consistent with the 130 GeV line can also\nproduce the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe via electroweak\nbaryogenesis. We find that such regions can in fact accommodate a strongly\nfirst-order electroweak phase transition (due to the singlet contribution to\nthe effective potential), while also avoiding a light stop and producing a\nStandard Model-like Higgs in the observed mass range. Simultaneously,\nCP-violation from a complex phase in the wino-higgsino sector can account for\nthe observed baryon asymmetry through resonant sources at the electroweak phase\ntransition, while satisfying current constraints from dark matter, collider,\nand electric dipole moment (EDM) experiments. This result is possible by virtue\nof a relatively light pseudoscalar Higgs sector with a small degree of mixing,\nwhich yields efficient s-channel resonant neutralino annihilation consistent\nwith indirect detection constraints, and of the moderate values of $\\mu$\nrequired to obtain a bino-like LSP consistent with the line.

Based on the initial conditions such as the inflaton mass and its\ndecay branching ratio to DM, reheating temperature, and the DM mass and\ninteraction rate with the thermal bath, the DM particles can either thermalize\n(fully/partially) with the primordial bath or remain non-thermal throughout\ntheir evolution history. In the thermal case, the final abundance is set by the\nstandard freeze-out mechanism for large annihilation rates, irrespective of the\ninitial conditions. For smaller annihilation rates, it can be set by the\nfreeze-in mechanism, also independent of the initial abundance, provided it is\nsmall to begin with. For even smaller interaction rates, the DM decouples while\nbeing non-thermal, and the relic abundance will be essentially set by the\ninitial conditions. We put model-independent constraints on the DM mass and\nannihilation rate from over-abundance by exactly solving the relevant Boltzmann\nequations, and identify the thermal freeze-out, freeze-in and non-thermal\nregions of the allowed parameter space.

We present two-dimensional axisymmetric\nhydrodynamical simulations which start from a collapsar engine and evolve all\nthe way through the late afterglow phase. The resultant outflow includes a jet\ncore which is highly relativistic after breaking out of the star, but becomes\nbaryon-loaded after colliding with a massive outer shell, corresponding to mass\nfrom the stellar atmosphere of the progenitor star which became trapped in\nfront of the jet core at breakout. The prompt emission produced before or\nduring this collision would then have the signature of a high Lorentz factor\njet, but the afterglow is produced by the amalgamated post-collision ejecta\nwhich has more inertia than the original highly relativistic jet core and thus\nhas a delayed deceleration.

In describing the chemical equilibrium we use\nquantities which are invariant under redefinition of fermion phases (we refer\nto this redefinition as a change of basis for short), and therefore it is a\nbasis invariant treatment. The change of the anomaly terms due to the change of\nthe path integral measure [3,4] under a basis change is taken into account. We\nfind it is useful to go back and forth between different bases, and there are\ninsights which can be more easily obtained in one basis rather than another. A\ntoy model is provided to illustrate the ideas.\n  For the axion leptogenesis model [1], our result suggests that at $T >\n10^{13}$ GeV , when sphaleron processes decouple, and $\\Gamma_{B+L} << H <\n\\Gamma_L$ (where $H$ is the Hubble parameter at temperature $T$ and $\\Gamma_L$\nis the $\\Delta L = 2$ lepton number violating interaction rate), the amount of\n$B-L$ created is controlled by the smallness of the sphaleron interaction rate,\n$\\Gamma_{B+L}$.

However, many factors can significantly\nimpact their late-time cosmological abundances. For example, in cases where the\npotentials for these fields are generated dynamically --- such as during\ncosmological mass-generating phase transitions --- the duration of the time\ninterval required for these potentials to fully develop can have significant\nrepercussions. Likewise, in scenarios with multiple scalars, mixing amongst the\nfields can also give rise to an effective timescale that modifies the resulting\nlate-time abundances. Previous studies have focused on the effects of either\nthe first or the second timescale in isolation. In this paper, by contrast, we\nexamine the new features that arise from the interplay between these two\ntimescales when both mixing and time-dependent phase transitions are introduced\ntogether. First, we find that the effects of these timescales can conspire to\nalter not only the total late-time abundance of the system --- often by many\norders of magnitude --- but also its distribution across the different fields.\nSecond, we find that these effects can produce large parametric resonances\nwhich render the energy densities of the fields highly sensitive to the degree\nof mixing as well as the duration of the time interval over which the phase\ntransition unfolds. Finally, we find that these effects can even give rise to a\n\"re-overdamping\" phenomenon which causes the total energy density of the system\nto behave in novel ways that differ from those exhibited by pure dark matter or\nvacuum energy. All of these features therefore give rise to new possibilities\nfor early-universe phenomenology and cosmological evolution.

We investigate\nthese effects as well as the discovery potential for dark matter\nco-annihilation partners at the LHC. A small mass splitting between the dark\nmatter and its partner is preferred by the co-annihilation mechanism and\nsuggests that the co-annihilation partners may be long-lived (stable or\nmeta-stable) at collider scales. It is argued that such long-lived electrically\ncharged particles can be looked for at the LHC in searches of anomalous charged\ntracks. This approach and the underlying models provide an\nalternative/complementarity to the mono-jet and multi-jet based dark matter\nsearches widely used in the context of simplified models with the s-channel\nmediators. We consider four types of simplified models with different particle\nspins and coupling structures. Some of these models are manifestly gauge\ninvariant and renormalizable, others would ultimately require a UV completion.\nThese can be realised in terms of supersymmetric models in the neutralino-stau\nco-annihilation regime, as well as models with extra dimensions or composite\nmodels. \n\n"}

Even if future experiments\nlower their energy thresholds, they will still be blind to parameter space\nwhere dark matter particles interact with nuclei strongly enough that they lose\nenough energy and become unable to cause a signal above the experimental\nthreshold by the time they reach the underground detector. Therefore in case\ndark matter is in the sub-GeV region and strongly interacting, possible\nunderground scatterings of dark matter with terrestrial nuclei must be taken\ninto account because they affect significantly the recoil spectra and event\nrates, regardless of whether the experiment probes DM via DM-nucleus or\nDM-electron interaction.

We use cosmological\nsimulations to predict the angular correlation functions of intensity\nfluctuations due to unresolved radio galaxies, cluster radio halos and relics\nand free-free emission from the interstellar and intergalactic medium at the\nfrequencies and angular scales relevant for the proposed 21cm tomography. In\naccord with previous findings, the brightness temperature fluctuations due to\nforeground sources are much larger than those from the primary 21cm signal at\nall scales. In particular, diffuse cluster radio emission, which has been\npreviously neglected, provides the most significant foreground contamination.\nHowever, we show that the contribution to the angular fluctuations at scales\n\\theta > 1' is dominated by the spatial clustering of bright foreground\nsources.

The primordial nucleosynthesis bounds demand that the\nmirror sector should have a smaller temperature T' than the ordinary one T, and\nby this reason its evolution can be substantially deviated from the standard\ncosmology. In this paper we took scalar adiabatic perturbations as the input in\na flat Universe, and computed the power spectra for ordinary and mirror CMB and\nLSS, changing the cosmological parameters, and always comparing with the CDM\ncase. We found differences in both the CMB and LSS power spectra, and we\ndemonstrated that the LSS spectrum is particularly sensitive to the mirror\nparameters, due to the presence of both the oscillatory features of mirror\nbaryons and the collisional mirror Silk damping. For x<0.3 the mirror\nbaryon-photon decoupling happens before the matter-radiation equality, so that\nCMB and LSS power spectra in linear regime are equivalent for mirror and CDM\ncases. For higher x-values the LSS spectra strongly depend on the amount of\nmirror baryons.

Nevertheless, the finite temperature and horizon\nscales at which these particles decoupled imprint generic signatures on their\nsmall scales density fluctuations. We show that the previously recognized\ncut-off in the fluctuation power-spectrum due to free-streaming of particles at\nthe thermal speed of decoupling, is supplemented by acoustic oscillations owing\nto the initial coupling between the cold dark matter (CDM) and the radiation\nfield. The power-spectrum oscillations appear on the scale of the horizon at\nthermal decoupling which corresponds to a mass scale of\n\\~10^{-4}*(T_d/10MeV)^{-3} solar masses for a CDM decoupling temperature T_d.\nThe suppression of the power-spectrum on smaller scales by the acoustic\noscillations is physically independent from the free-streaming effect, although\nthe two cut-off scales are coincidentally comparable for T_d~10MeV and a\nparticle mass of M~100GeV.

We show how the mass spectrum of Split Supersymmetry naturally\nemerges from theories where the dominant source of supersymmetry breaking\npreserves an $R$ symmetry, characterize the class of theories where the\nunavoidable $R$-breaking by gravity can be neglected, and point out a new\npossibility, where supersymmetry breaking is directly communicated at tree\nlevel to the visible sector via renormalizable interactions. Next, we discuss\npossible low-energy signals for Split Supersymmetry. The absence of new light\nscalars removes all the phenomenological difficulties of low-energy\nsupersymmetry, associated with one-loop flavor and CP violating effects.\nHowever, the electric dipole moments of leptons and quarks do arise at two\nloops, and are automatically at the level of present limits with no need for\nsmall phases, making them accessible to several ongoing new-generation\nexperiments. We also study proton decay in the context of Split Supersymmetry,\nand point out scenarios where the dimension-six induced decays may be\nobservable. Finally, we show that the novel spectrum of Split Supersymmetry\nopens up new possibilities for the generation of dark matter, as the decays of\nultraheavy gravitinos in the early universe typically increase the abundance of\nthe lightest neutralino above its usual freeze-out value.

Abstract: It is of great interest whether the recent KamLAND bound on the flux of\nelectron antineutrinos from the Sun constrains the electromagnetic properties\nof the neutrino. We examine the efficiency of the electron antineutrino\nproduction in the solar magnetic fields, assuming the neutrinos are Majorana\nparticles with a relatively large transition moment. We consider fields both in\nthe radiative and convective zones of the Sun, with physically plausible\nstrengths, and take into account the recently established values of the\noscillation parameters. Our analysis shows that the production rate in question\nis presently unobservable. In the radiative zone, it is suppressed by the large\nmeasured value of the flavor mixing angle which eliminates the resonant level\ncrossing. A corresponding general resonance condition, valid for large as well\nas small values of the mixing angle, is derived. Likewise, in the convective\nzone, the strength of the small-scale magnetic field is likely insufficient.\nThus, no useful bound on the neutrino transition moment can be derived from the\npublished KamLAND bound.

Lattice simulations of fully nonlinear preheating dynamics show\nspecific features of this intermediate stage: occupation numbers of the scalar\nparticles are peaked, scalar fields become significantly non-gaussian and the\nfield dynamics become chaotic and irreversible. Visualization of the field\ndynamics in configuration space reveals that nonlinear interactions generate\nnon-gaussian inflaton inhomogeneities with very fast growing amplitudes.

Since black holes are believed to violate global symmetries, particle\ndecays can violate lepton and baryon numbers.

It has\nalready been shown that in an infinite-size star the total energy due to\nneutrino exchange vanishes exactly. The opposite claim that massless neutrino\nexchange would produce a huge energy is due to an improper summation of an\ninfrared-divergent quantity. The same vanishing of the total energy has been\nproved exactly in the case of a finite star in a one-dimensional toy model.\n  Here we study the three-dimensional case.

Second, the\nUniverse expands exponentially, but with a Planck mass smaller than its present\nvalue. Because the Planck mass during inflation is small, density fluctuations\nin agreement with observations can arise naturally. Third, when inflation ends,\nthe Universe reheats, and the radion becomes free to expand once more. During\nthe third phase the Universe is ``radiation-dominated'' and tends toward a\nfixed-point evolutionary model in which the radion grows but the temperature\nremains unchanged. Ultimately, the radion becomes trapped once again at its\npresent value, and a short period of exponential expansion, which we identify\nwith the electroweak phase transition, ensues.

We study the\nvacuum polarization energy of renormalizable, continuum quantum field theory in\nthe presence of a background field, designed to impose a Dirichlet boundary\ncondition in a particular limit.

This result implies that the energy depends in detail on the\nproperties of the material, which are not captured by the idealized boundary\nconditions.

{"id": "hep-th/0405159", "contents": "Title: Supersymmetric Unification Without Low Energy Supersymmetry And\n  Signatures for Fine-Tuning at the LHC Abstract: The cosmological constant problem is a failure of naturalness and suggests\nthat a fine-tuning mechanism is at work, which may also address the hierarchy\nproblem. An example -- supported by Weinberg's successful prediction of the\ncosmological constant -- is the potentially vast landscape of vacua in string\ntheory, where the existence of galaxies and atoms is promoted to a vacuum\nselection criterion. Then, low energy SUSY becomes unnecessary, and\nsupersymmetry -- if present in the fundamental theory -- can be broken near the\nunification scale. All the scalars of the supersymmetric standard model become\nultraheavy, except for a single finely tuned Higgs. Yet, the fermions of the\nsupersymmetric standard model can remain light, protected by chiral symmetry,\nand account for the successful unification of gauge couplings. This framework\nremoves all the difficulties of the SSM: the absence of a light Higgs and\nsparticles, dimension five proton decay, SUSY flavor and CP problems, and the\ncosmological gravitino and moduli problems. High-scale SUSY breaking raises the\nmass of the light Higgs to about 120-150 GeV. The gluino is strikingly long\nlived, and a measurement of its lifetime can determine the ultraheavy scalar\nmass scale. Measuring the four Yukawa couplings of the Higgs to the gauginos\nand higgsinos precisely tests for high-scale SUSY. These ideas, if confirmed,\nwill demonstrate that supersymmetry is present but irrelevant for the hierarchy\nproblem -- just as it has been irrelevant for the cosmological constant problem\n-- strongly suggesting the existence of a fine-tuning mechanism in nature. \n\n"}
