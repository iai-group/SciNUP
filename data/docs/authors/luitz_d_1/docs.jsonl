Rev. B 75, 155111\n(2007)]. To characterize a possible many-body localization transition as a\nfunction of the disorder strength $W$, we use an exact renormalization\nprocedure in configuration space that generalizes the Aoki real-space RG\nprocedure for Anderson localization one-particle models [H.

We focus on the statistical properties of the renormalized\nhopping $V_L$ between two configurations separated by a distance $L$ in\nconfiguration space (distance being defined as the minimal number of elementary\nmoves to go from one configuration to the other). Our numerical results point\ntowards the existence of a many-body localization transition at a finite\ndisorder strength $W_c$.

Consequently, by supplementing the Hamiltonian of\nthe SU(N) model with a perturbation Hamiltonian that removes the GS degeneracy,\nthe LT is to apply also for the SU(N) model in the limit of the coupling\nconstant, \\lambda, of this perturbation approaching zero, where the limit\n\\lambda --> 0 is clearly to be taken subsequent to taking the zero-temperature\nlimit of the thermal single-particle Green function in the expression for the\nLuttinger number N_L. We explicitly establish the validity of this statement\nfor the case of N=4. The details of the relevant calculations being distinctly\ntransparent, one can readily convince oneself that our observation is valid for\narbitrary N. It follows that the issues raised by DPK, such as non-existence of\nthe Luttinger-Ward functional and \"breakdown of the elemental particle picture\nin strongly correlated electron matter\", are all inessential to the observed\nfailure of the LT.

The protecting Hamiltonian is chosen such that its degenerate\nground subspace is an error detecting code for the errors caused by the\ninteraction with the environment. We consider environments with arbitrary\nnumber of local sites, e.g. spins, whose interactions among themselves are\nlocal and bounded. Then, assuming the system is interacting with a finite\nnumber of sites in the environment, we prove that, up to second order with\nrespect to the coupling constant, decoherence and relaxation are suppressed by\na factor which grows exponentially fast with the ratio of energy penalty to the\nnorm of local interactions in the environment.

We\npropose a single-particle framework to characterize these phases by the\neigenstates (the natural orbitals) and the eigenvalues (the occupation\nspectrum) of the one-particle density matrix (OPDM) in many-body eigenstates.\nAs a main result, we find that the natural orbitals are localized in the MBL\nphase, but delocalized in the ergodic phase. This qualitative change in these\nsingle-particle states is a many-body effect, since without interactions the\nsingle-particle energy eigenstates are all localized. The occupation spectrum\nin the ergodic phase is thermal in agreement with the eigenstate thermalization\nhypothesis, while in the MBL phase the occupations preserve a discontinuity at\nan emergent Fermi edge. This suggests that the MBL eigenstates are weakly\ndressed Slater determinants, with the eigenstates of the underlying Anderson\nproblem as reference states.

Although a conventional perspective\nsuggests that delocalized states act as a thermalizing bath for the localized\nstates in the presence of of interactions, there is evidence that such systems\ncan display non-ergodicity. This is in part due to the fact that the\ndelocalized states do not have any kind of protection due to symmetry or\ntopology and are thus susceptible to localization. A study of non-interacting\nincommensurate models shows that they admit extended, partially extended, and\nfully localized many-body states. These models cannot thermalize dynamically\nand remain localized upon the introduction of interactions. In particular, for\na certain range of energy, the system can host a non-ergodic extended (i.e.\nmetallic) phase in which the energy eigenstates violate the eigenstate\nthermalization hypothesis (ETH) but the entanglement entropy obeys volume-law\nscaling. The level statistics and entanglement growth also indicate the lack of\nergodicity in these models.

Abstract: Randomness is an essential tool in many disciplines of modern sciences, such\nas cryptography, black hole physics, random matrix theory and Monte Carlo\nsampling. In quantum systems, random operations can be obtained via random\ncircuits thanks to so-called q-designs, and play a central role in the fast\nscrambling conjecture for black holes. Here we consider a more physically\nmotivated way of generating random evolutions by exploiting the many-body\ndynamics of a quantum system driven with stochastic external pulses. We combine\ntechniques from quantum control, open quantum systems and exactly solvable\nmodels (via the Bethe-Ansatz) to generate Haar-uniform random operations in\ndriven many-body systems. We show that any fully controllable system converges\nto a unitary q-design in the long-time limit. Moreover, we study the\nconvergence time of a driven spin chain by mapping its random evolution into a\nsemigroup with an integrable Liouvillean and finding its gap.

In the clean case, the Coulomb interaction has been found to be\nmarginally irrelevant, leading to Fermi liquid behavior. We extend the analysis\nto incorporate the effects of disorder. The nodal line structure gives rise to\nkinematical constraints similar to that for a two-dimensional Fermi surface,\nwhich plays a crucial role in the one-loop renor- malization of the disorder\ncouplings. For a two-fold degenerate nodal loop (Weyl loop), we show that\ndisorder flows to strong coupling along a unique fixed trajectory in the space\nof symmetry inequiv- alent disorder couplings.

We show that the criticality of the\ntargeted model can be faithfully identified by the tMPS, using the mature\nscaling schemes of correlation length and entanglement entropy in 1D quantum\ntheories. We benchmark our proposal with the results obtained for the\nHeisenberg anti-ferromagnet on honeycomb lattice. We demonstrate critical\nscaling relation of the tMPS for the gapless case, and a trivial scaling for\nthe gapped case with spatial anisotropy. The critical scaling behaviors are\ninsensitive to the system size, suggesting the criticality can be identified in\nsmall systems. Our tMPS scheme for critical scaling shows clearly that the\nspin-1/2 kagom\\'e Heisenberg antiferromagnet has a gapless ground state. More\ngenerally, the present study indicates that the 1D conformal field theories in\nimaginary time provide a very useful tool to characterize the criticality of\nhigher dimensional quantum systems. \n\n"}

Thereafter, we consider that the matter field propagates only\nin (2+1) dimensions, whereas the bosonic field is free to propagate out of the\nplane. Within these assumptions, we apply a mechanism for dimensional\nreduction, which yields an effective model in (2+1) dimensions. In particular,\nfor the gauge-field case, we use the Stueckelberg mechanism in order to\npreserve gauge invariance. We refer to this version as nonlocal-Proca quantum\nelectrodynamics (NPQED).

Discrete topological gauge theories can typically\nbe embedded into continuous quantum field theories. In the 2-form case, the\ncontinuous theory is shown to be a strict 2-group gauge theory.

However in an\nexperimental realization of such a system, spurious interactions may cause the\nedge zero modes to delocalize. To stabilize against this influence beyond\nsimply increasing the bulk gap, it has been proposed to harness suitable\nnotions of disorder. Equipped with numerical tools for constructing locally\nconserved operators that we introduce, we comprehensively explore the interplay\nof local interactions and disorder on localized edge modes in the XZX cluster\nHamiltonian. This puts us in a position to challenge the narrative that\ndisorder necessarily stabilizes topological order.

Moreover, disorder helps localize only a subset of\nedge modes in the many-body interacting regime. We identify one edge mode\noperator that behaves as if subjected to a non-interacting perturbation, i.e.,\nshows no disorder dependence. This implies that in finite systems, edge mode\noperators effectively delocalize at distinct interaction strengths.

By\ncontrast, for sufficiently strong coupling, corresponding to the black hole\nphase, level statistics are well described by random matrix theory. This\ntransition in level statistics coincides approximately with a previously\nreported Hawking-Page transition for weak coupling. We have shown explicitly\nthat this thermodynamic transition turns into a sharp crossover as the coupling\nincreases. Likewise, this critical coupling also corresponds with the one at\nwhich the overlap between the ground state and the thermofield double state\n(TFD) is smallest. In the range of sizes we can reach by exact diagonalization,\nthe ground state is well approximated by the TFD state only in the strong\ncoupling limit.

In this region, the spectral\ndensity is separated into blobs centered around the eigenvalues of the spin\noperator. For weaker couplings, the exponential decay of coefficients in a\ntensor product basis, typical of the TFD, becomes power law.

In the first model a \\pm\nJ-distribution of the bonds is chosen, in the second model a Gaussian\ndistribution. In both cases the first two moments of the distribution are\nchosen to be J_0=-1, Delta J=+1, so that no ferromagnetic ordering of the Potts\nspins can occur. We find that for all temperatures investigated the spin glass\nsusceptibility remains finite, the spin glass order parameter remains zero, and\nthat the specific heat has only a smooth Schottky-like peak. These results can\nbe understood quantitatively by considering small but independent clusters of\nspins. Hence we have evidence that there is no static phase transition at any\nnonzero temperature. Consistent with these findings, only very minor size\neffects are observed, which implies that all correlation lengths of the models\nremain very short. We also compute for both models the time auto-correlation\nfunction C(t) of the Potts spins. While in the Gaussian model C(t) shows a\nsmooth uniform decay, the correlator for the \\pm J model has several distinct\nsteps.

It is determined by\nthe nodes in the fermionic spectrum, which are protected by topology in\nmomentum space (in some cases, in combination with the vacuum symmetry).

Recently, such states were shown to be a\nconvenient point of departure for studying translational symmetry breaking in\ndoped antiferromagnets: these results are briefly reviewed here with an\nemphasis on experimental implications.

Within a strictly standard Boltzmann\nand Fermi-liquid framework, we analyze these phenomena and their relation to\nthe mesoscopic fluctuation-dissipation theorem, which we prove.

{"id": "cond-mat/9912020", "contents": "Title: Quantum impurity dynamics in two-dimensional antiferromagnets and\n  superconductors Abstract: We present the universal theory of arbitrary, localized impurities in a\nconfining paramagnetic state of two-dimensional antiferromagnets with global\nSU(2) spin symmetry. The energy gap of the host antiferromagnet to spin-1\nexcitations, \\Delta, is assumed to be significantly smaller than a typical\nnearest neighbor exchange. In the absence of impurities, it was argued in\nearlier work (Chubukov et al. cond-mat/9304046) that the low-temperature\nquantum dynamics is universally and completely determined by the values of\n\\Delta and a spin-wave velocity c. Here we establish the remarkable fact that\nno additional parameters are necessary for an antiferromagnet with a dilute\nconcentration of impurities, n_{imp} - each impurity is completely\ncharacterized by a integer/half-odd-integer valued spin, S, which measures the\nnet uncompensated Berry phase due to spin precession in its vicinity. We\ncompute the impurity-induced damping of the spin-1 collective mode of the\nantiferromagnet: the damping occurs on an energy scale \\Gamma= n_{imp} (\\hbar\nc)^2/\\Delta, and we predict a universal, asymmetric lineshape for the\ncollective mode peak. We argue that, under suitable conditions, our results\napply unchanged (or in some cases, with minor modifications) to d-wave\nsuperconductors, and compare them to recent neutron scattering experiments on\nYBCO by Fong et al.

A one-loop field theory computation, which involves\nsolving a Heisenberg chain by means of the Bethe ansatz agrees with the large\nangular momentum limit of a rotating string. We point out that the Heisenberg\nchain can be equally well solved by using a sigma model approach. Moreover we\nalso show that a certain limit, akin to the BMN limit, leads exactly to the\nsame sigma model for a string rotating with large angular momentum. The\nagreement is then at the level of the action. As an upshot we propose that the\nrotating string should be identified with a coherent, semi-classical state\nbuilt out of the eigenstates of the spin chain. The agreement is then complete.\nFor example we show that the mean value of the spin <S> gives, precisely, the\nposition of the string in the bulk.
