Abstract: Conventional wisdom says that the simpler the Lagrangian of a theory the\nsimpler its perturbation theory, but an increased understanding of the\nstructure of the S-matrix in gauge theories and gravity has been pointing to\nthe opposite conclusion. In this paper we suggest that N=8 SUGRA has the\nsimplest interacting S-matrix in 4D. Using Grassmann coherent states for\nexternal particles shows that amplitudes with maximal SUSY are smooth objects,\nwith the action of SUSY manifest. We show that all tree amplitudes in N=4 SYM\nand N=8 SUGRA vanish at (supersymmetric) infinite complex momentum, and can\nthus be determined by recursion relations. We also identify the action of the\nnon-linearly realized E_{7(7)} symmetry of N=8 SUGRA on scattering amplitudes.\nWe give a simple discussion of the structure of 1-loop amplitudes in any QFT,\nin close parallel to recent work of Forde, showing that the coefficients of\nscalar \"triangle\" and \"bubble\" integrals are determined by the \"pole at\ninfinite momentum\" of tree amplitude products appearing in cuts. The on-shell\nsuperspace for maximal SUSY makes it easy to compute the multiplet sums that\narise in these cuts, leading to a simple proof of the absence of triangles and\nbubbles at 1-loop. We also argue that rational terms are absent. This\nestablishes the recent conjecture that 1-loop amplitudes in N=8 SUGRA have only\nscalar box integrals, just as N=4 SYM. It is natural to conjecture that with\nmaximal SUSY, amplitudes are completely determined by their leading\nsingularities even beyond tree- and 1-loop level; this would directly imply the\nperturbative finiteness of N=8 SUGRA.

In particular, the approach uses\nthe spectral presheaf. The intuitionistic logic of this approach is given by\nthe (complete) Heyting algebra of closed open subob jects of the spectral\npresheaf. We show that this Heyting algebra is, in a natural way, a locale in\nthe ambient topos, and compare this locale with the internal Gelfand spectrum\nof the covariant approach.

The main\nemphasis of this study is the normal ground state, which is realized at\nsufficiently high temperatures and/or sufficiently large chemical potentials.\nIn contrast to the vacuum state, which is characterized by the magnetic\ncatalysis of chiral symmetry breaking, the normal state is accompanied by the\ndynamical generation of the chiral shift parameter $\\Delta$. In the chiral\nlimit, the value of $\\Delta$ determines a relative shift of the longitudinal\nmomenta (along the direction of the magnetic field) in the dispersion relations\nof opposite chirality fermions. We argue that the chirality remains a good\napproximate quantum number even for massive fermions in the vicinity of the\nFermi surface and, therefore, the chiral shift is expected to play an important\nrole in many types of cold dense relativistic matter, relevant for applications\nin compact stars.

Its second goal is to evaluate the importance of\ninhomogeneities in the determination of dark energy parameters, whose real\nnature is still unknown and for which the influence of matter structures has\nbeen proposed as a cosmological alternative. We start with the definition of a\n\"geodesic lightcone\" gauge simplifying greatly the study of light propagation\nin the Universe. We then define a gauge invariant average of scalars on the\npast light cone and compute the effect of inhomogeneities on the luminosity\nflux by considering their power spectrum up to its non-linear regime. The\neffect on the flux is negligible whereas observables like the luminosity\ndistance, computed at second order in perturbations, are much more affected. We\nalso study the distance modulus at the basis of the discovery of dark energy\nfrom type Ia supernovae (SNe). The average of this modulus is only slightly\naffected by inhomogeneities but its variance sensitively depends on them. These\nresults show, within their hypotheses, that an alternative to dark energy by an\neffect of structures is impossible but, at the same time, emphasize their\nimportance on the dispersion of data in the Hubble diagram. The dominating\nphysical effects turn out to be peculiar velocity of SNe and weak lensing. Our\npredictions on the dispersion are in very good agreement with first analyses\ncarried out so far to detect a signal of lensing among SNe Ia data and will be\ntestable in the near future. \n\n"}

In this\nthesis, the RGZ framework, designed to provide a proper quantization of YM\ntheories by taking into account the existence of the so-called Gribov copies is\nexplored. Successfully introduced in the Landau gauge, the RGZ set up does not\nextend easily to different gauges. The main reason is that a clear formulation\nof the analogue of the Gribov horizon in the Landau gauge is obstructed by\ntechnical difficulties when more sophisticated gauges are chosen. Moreover, the\nRGZ action breaks BRST symmetry explicitly, making the task of extracting gauge\ninvariant results even more difficult. The main goal of the present thesis is\nprecisely to provide a consistent framework to extend the RGZ action to gauges\nthat are connected to Landau gauge via a gauge parameter.

Besides earth-based GW detectors, the\ndrag-free sensitivity of the LISA Pathfinder has already reached to the LISA\ngoal level, paving the road for space GW detectors. Over the whole GW spectrum\n(from aHz to THz) there are efforts for detection, notably the\nvery-low-frequency band (pulsar timing array [PTA], 300 pHz-100 nHz) and the\nextremely-low (Hubble)-frequency (cosmic microwave background [CMB] experiment,\n1 aHz-10 fHz). \n\n"}

In such materials, time-dependent\npumping of electrons from a non-chiral external source generates a\nnon-vanishing chiral chemical potential. This is due to the different\ncapacities of the left- and right-handed (LH and RH) chiral Weyl cones arising\nfrom the difference in the density of states in the LH and RH cones. The chiral\nchemical potential then generates, via the chiral anomaly, a current along the\ndirection of an applied magnetic field even in the absence of an external\nelectric field. The source of chirality imbalance in this new setup is thus due\nto the band structure of the system and the presence of (non-chiral) electron\nsource, and not due to the parallel electric and magnetic fields. We illustrate\nthe effect by an argument based on the effective field theory, and by the\nchiral kinetic theory calculation for a rotationally invariant Weyl semimetal\nwith different Fermi velocities in the left and right chiral Weyl cones; we\nalso consider the case of a Weyl semimetal with Weyl nodes at different\nenergies.

The formula also correctly\npredicts that an extra correction term is required in the sparse regime and in\nthe ultra-dense regime. We further show that the different expressions\ncorrespond to the degrees in the canonical ensemble being asymptotically\nGaussian in the dense regime and asymptotically Poisson in the sparse regime\n(the latter confirms what we found in earlier work), and the dual degrees in\nthe canonical ensemble being asymptotically Poisson in the ultra-dense regime.\nIn general, we show that the degrees follow a multivariate version of the\nPoisson-Binomial distribution in the canonical ensemble. \n\n"}

A colored building block is determined by its boundary triangulation,\nwhich in the case of polygons is simply characterized by its length. In three\ndimensions, colored building blocks are labeled by some 2D triangulations and\nthose homeomorphic to the 3-ball are labeled by the subset of planar ones.\nSimilarly to Euler's formula in 2D which provides an upper bound to the number\nof vertices at fixed number of polygons with given lengths, we look in three\ndimensions for an upper bound on the number of edges at fixed number of given\ncolored building blocks. In this article we solve this problem when all colored\nbuilding blocks, except possibly one, are homeomorphic to the 3-ball.

(ii) One desires to test out\nalternatives to Einstein's gravitational theory, in particular those of a\ngauge-theoretical nature, like Einstein-Cartan theory or metric-affine gravity.\nA clean discussion requires a reflection on the foundations of electrodynamics.\nIf one bases electrodynamics on the conservation laws of electric charge and\nmagnetic flux, one finds Maxwell's equations expressed in terms of the\nexcitation H=(D,H) and the field strength F=(E,B) without any intervention of\nthe metric or the linear connection of spacetime. In other words, there is\nstill no coupling to gravity. Only the constitutive law H= functional(F)\nmediates such a coupling.

We assume that the metric fluctuations\nare described by a statistical ensemble. The stochastic variables are the\nphases and the amplitudes of Fourier modes of the fluctuations.

In previous\nwork, the precise meaning of gauge theories obtained by monodromies that do not\ncorrespond to Seiberg duality was unclear.

The\ninput in this construction is not a classical Lagrangian, but rather a\nprescribed factorizing S-matrix, i.e. the inverse scattering problem for such\nquantum field theories is studied.\n  For a large class of factorizing S-matrices, certain associated quantum\nfields, which are localized in wedge-shaped regions of Minkowski space, are\nconstructed explicitely. With the help of these fields, the local observable\ncontent of the corresponding model is defined and analyzed by employing methods\nfrom the algebraic framework of quantum field theory.\n  The abstract problem in this analysis amounts to the question under which\nconditions an algebra of wedge-localized observables can be used to generate a\nnet of local observable algebras with the right physical properties. The answer\ngiven here uses the so-called modular nuclearity condition, which is shown to\nimply the existence of local observables and the Reeh-Schlieder property.\n  In the analysis of the concrete models, this condition is proven for a large\nfamily of S-matrices, including the scattering operators of the Sinh-Gordon\nmodel and the scaling Ising model as special examples.

The\ncoordinates of these moving points give a new set of Darboux coordinates called\nthe spectral Darboux coordinates. The system of isomonodromic deformations is\nthereby converted to a non-autonomous Hamiltonian system in the spectral\nDarboux coordinates. The Hamiltonians turn out to resemble those of a\npreviously known isomonodromic system of a second order scalar ODE. The two\nisomonodromic systems are shown to be linked by a simple relation. \n\n"}
