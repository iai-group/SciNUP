We derive the effective action for the phonon fields\nthat describe space- and time-dependent fluctuations of the crystal structure\nformed by $\\Delta$, and obtain the shear modulus from the coefficients of the\nspatial derivative terms.

This paper demonstrates, using a combination of new ARPES measurements\nand quantum Monte Carlo simulations, that the HEA is not simply the by-product\nof matrix element effects, but rather represents a cross-over from a\nquasiparticle band at low binding energies near the Fermi level to valence\nbands at higher binding energy, assumed to be of strong oxygen character, in\nboth hole- and electron-doped cuprates. While photoemission matrix elements\nclearly play a role in changing the aesthetic appearance of the band\ndispersion, i.e. the 'waterfall'-like behavior, they provide an inadequate\ndescription for the physics that underlies the strong band renormalization\ngiving rise to the HEA.

A\nGutzwiller wavefunction study of the triangular lattice Heisenberg model with\nappropriate four-spin ring exchanges has found that the projected spinon Fermi\nsea state has a low variational energy. This wavefunction, together with a\nslave particle gauge theory, suggests that such spin liquid possesses spin\ncorrelations that are singular along surfaces in momentum space (\"Bose\nsurfaces\"). Signatures of this state, which we refer to as a \"Spin Bose-Metal\"\n(SBM), are expected to be manifest in quasi-1D ladder systems: The discrete\ntransverse momenta cut through the 2D Bose surface leading to a distinct\npattern of 1D gapless modes. Here we search for a quasi-1D descendant of the\ntriangular lattice SBM state by exploring the Heisenberg plus ring model on a\ntwo-leg strip (zigzag chain). Using DMRG, variational wavefunctions, and a\nBosonization analysis, we map out the full phase diagram. Without ring exchange\nthe model is equivalent to the J_1 - J_2 Heisenberg chain, and we find the\nexpected Bethe-chain and dimerized phases. Remarkably, moderate ring exchange\nreveals a new gapless phase over a large swath of the phase diagram.

Lett. 102, 057202 (2009)]\ndemonstrated that the classical simulation of the dynamics of open 1D quantum\nsystems with matrix product algorithms can often be dramatically improved by\nperforming time evolution in the Heisenberg picture. For a closed system this\nwas exemplified by an exact matrix product operator solution of the\ntime-evolved creation operator of a quadratic fermi chain with a matrix\ndimension of just two. In this work we show that this exact solution can be\nsignificantly generalized to include the case of an open quadratic fermi chain\nsubjected to master equation evolution with Lindblad operators that are linear\nin the fermionic operators. Remarkably even in this open system the\ntime-evolution of operators continues to be described by matrix product\noperators with the same fixed dimension as that required by the solution of a\ncoherent quadratic fermi chain for all times. Through the use of matrix product\nalgorithms the dynamical behaviour of operators in this non-equilibrium open\nquantum system can be computed with a cost that is linear in the system size.\nWe present some simple numerical examples which highlight how useful this might\nbe for the more detailed study of open system dynamics.

The\nderived phase diagram shows that charge stripe order (CO) coexists with bulk\nsuperconductivity in a broad range of doping around x=1/8, although the CO\norder parameter falls off quickly for x<>1/8. Except for x=0.155, the onset of\nCO always coincides with the transition between the orthorhombic and the\ntetragonal low temperature structures. The CO transition evolves from a sharp\ndrop at low x to a more gradual transition at higher x, eventually falling\nbelow the structural phase boundary for optimum doping. With respect to the\ninterlayer CO correlations, we find no qualitative change of the stripe\nstacking order as a function of doping, and in-plane and out-of-plane\ncorrelations disappear simultaneously at the transition. Similarly to the CO,\nthe spin stripe order (SO) is also most pronounced at x=1/8.

These states can be\nmapped onto conventional fractional quantum Hall states through the Wannier\nstate representation (Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 126803 (2011)). In this paper, we\nuse the Wannier state representation to construct the pseudopotential\nHamiltonians for fractional Chern insulators, which are interaction\nHamiltonians with certain ideal model wavefunctions as exact ground states. We\nshow that these pseudopotential Hamiltonians can be approximated by\nshort-ranged interactions in fractional Chern insulators, and that their range\nwill be minimized by an optimal gauge choice for the Wannier states. As\nillustrative examples, we explicitly write down the form of the lowest\npseudopotential for several fractional Chern insulator models including the\nlattice Dirac model and the checkerboard model with Chern number 1, and the\nd-wave model and the triangular lattice model with Chern number 2.

By strongly varying the chemical potentials of\nthe two chains, quantum phase transitions towards fully polarized (empty or\nfull) fermionic chains occur. In the Kitaev model, the quantum critical point\nseparating the topological superconducting phase and the polarized phase\nbelongs to the universality class of the critical Ising model in two\ndimensions. When increasing the Coulomb interaction between chains, then we\nidentify an additional phase corresponding to two critical Ising theories (or\ntwo chains of Majorana fermions). We confirm the existence of such a phase from\nexact mappings and from the concept of bipartite fluctuations. We show the\nexistence of negative logarithmic corrections in the bipartite fluctuations, as\na reminiscence of the quantum critical point in the Kitaev model. Other\nentanglement probes such as bipartite entropy and entanglement spectrum are\nalso used to characterize the phase diagram. The limit of large interactions\ncan be reached in an equivalent setup of ultra-cold atoms and Josephson\njunctions. \n\n"}

Besides the usual spin-wave magnetic excitations, the model\nallows for topologically non-trivial static solutions of the equations of\nmotion, associated with the change of chirality (clockwise or counterclockwise)\nof the spiral. We consider two types of these topological defects, single\nvortices and vortex-antivortex pairs, and quantize the corresponding solutions\nby generalizing the semiclassical approach to a non-Abelian field theory. The\nuse of the collective coordinates allows us to represent the defect as a\nparticle coupled to a bath of harmonic oscillators, which can be integrated out\nemploying the Feynman-Vernon path-integral formalism. The resulting effective\naction for the defect indicates that its motion is damped due to the scattering\nby the magnons. We derive a general expression for the damping coefficient of\nthe defect, and evaluate its temperature dependence in both cases, for a single\nvortex and for a vortex-antivortex pair. Finally, we consider an application of\nthe model for cuprates, where a spiral state has been argued to be realized in\nthe spin-glass regime.

In our model, the qubit is an isolated system\nconsisting of a small island (Cooper-pair box) and a larger superconductor\n(reservoir) connected with each other by a tunable Josephson junction. If such\nsystem contains an odd number of electrons, then even at lowest temperatures a\nsingle quasiparticle is present in the qubit. Tunneling of a quasiparticle\nbetween the reservoir and the Cooper-pair box results in the relaxation of the\nqubit. We derive master equations governing the evolution of the qubit\ncoherences and populations.

{"id": "cond-mat/9912380", "contents": "Title: Quantum Confinement Transition and Cuprate Criticality Abstract: Theoretical attempts to explain the origin of high temperature\nsuperconductivity are challenged by the complexity of the normal state, which\nexhibits three regimes with increasing hole doping: a pseudo-gap regime when\nunderdoped, strange power laws near optimal doping and more conventional\nmetallic behavior when heavily overdoped. We suggest that the origin of this\nbehavior is linked to a zero temperature quantum phase transition separating\nthe overdoped Fermi liquid from a spin-charge separated underdoped phase.\nCentral to our analysis is a new $Z_2$ gauge theory formulation, which supports\ntopological vortex excitations - dubbed visons. The visons are gapped in the\nunderdoped phase, splitting the electron's charge and Fermi statistics into two\nseparate excitations. Superconductivity occurs when the resulting charge $e$\nboson condenses. The visons are condensed in the overdoped phase, thereby\nconfining the charge and statistics of the electron leading to a Fermi liquid\nphase. Right at the quantum confinement transition the visons are in a critical\nstate, leading to power law behavior for both charge and spin. \n\n"}
