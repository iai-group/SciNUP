The well-established evolution of the global even-odd\neffect with the fissioning system is found to be only a partial aspect of the\neven-odd structure. Indeed, it is shown that the global even-odd effect is\nvarying systematically with the mean asymmetry of the fission-fragment\ndistribution, and that the general increase of the even-odd staggering with\nasymmetry is depending on the fissioning system. Thus, the dependency of the\neven-odd effect with the fissioning system is accredited in part to the\nasymmetry evolution of the charge distribution, and not solely related to the\ndissipated energy as it has been done earlier.

In this paper, after reviewing the basic\nproperties of the Lambda(1405) resonance, we introduce the dynamical\ncoupled-channel model which respects chiral symmetry of QCD and the unitarity\nof the scattering amplitude. We show that the structure of the Lambda(1405)\nresonance is dominated by the meson-baryon molecule component and is described\nas a superposition of two independent states. The meson-baryon nature of\nLambda(1405) leads to various hadronic molecule states in few-body systems with\nstrangeness which are hadron composite systems driven by the hadronic\ninteractions. We summarize the recent progress in the investigation of the\nLambda(1405) structure and future perspective of the physics of the\nLambda(1405) resonance. \n\n"}

We examine\nfor the first time the realistic application of MT2-based measurement methods\nto a fully hadronic final state from a symmetric two-step decay chain with\nmaximal combinatorial uncertainty. Several problems arise in such an analysis:\nthe MT2 variables are powerful but fragile, with shallow edges that are easily\nwashed out or faked by ubiquitous combinatorics background. Traditional methods\nof both cleaning up the distribution and determining edge position can fail\nbadly. To perform successful mass measurements we introduce several new\ntechniques: the Edge-to-Bump method of extracting an edge from a distribution\nby analyzing a distribution of fits rather than a single fit; a very simple yet\nhigh-yield method for determining decay-chain assignments event-by-event; and a\nsystematic procedure to obtain MT2 edge measurements in the presence of heavy\ncombinatorics background, they key element being the parallel use of at least\ntwo independent methods of reducing combinatorics background to avoid fake\nmeasurements.

Instead of considering a\nsingle tree per jet, we propose that multiple trees should be considered,\nweighted by an appropriate metric. Then each jet in each event produces a\ndistribution for an observable, rather than a single value. Advantages of this\napproach include: 1) observables have significantly increased statistical\nstability; and, 2) new observables, such as the variance of the distribution,\nprovide new handles for signal and background discrimination.

Our results are\ndescribed in terms of a probability distribution for a real neutrino energy\nvalue. Several factors are responsible of the deviations from the reconstructed\nvalue. The main one is the multinucleon component of the neutrino interaction\nwhich in the case of Cherenkov detectors enters as a quasielastic cross\nsection, increasing the mean neutrino energy which can differ appreciably from\nthe reconstructed value. As an application we derive, for excess electron\nevents attributed to the conversion of muon neutrinos, the true neutrino energy\ndistribution based on the experimental one which is given in terms of the\nreconstructed value. The result is a reshaping effect. For MiniBooNE the low\nenergy peak is suppressed and shifted at higher energies, which may influence\nthe interpretation in terms of oscillation.

To avoid bias in the signal search, the present\nanalysis does not consider all those events, that fall in a 40 keV wide region\ncentered around Q_bb. The main parameters needed for the neutrinoless double\nbeta decay analysis are described. A background model was developed to describe\nthe observed energy spectrum. The model contains several contributions, that\nare expected on the basis of material screening or that are established by the\nobservation of characteristic structures in the energy spectrum. The model\npredicts a flat energy spectrum for the blinding window around Q_bb with a\nbackground index ranging from 17.6 to 23.8*10^{-3} counts/(keV kg yr).

In the past ten years, neutrino oscillation\nexperiments have finally provided the incontrovertible evidence that neutrinos\nmix and have finite masses. These results represent the strongest demonstration\nthat the Standard Model of electroweak interactions is incomplete and that new\nPhysics beyond it must exist. None of these experimental efforts could however\nshade light on some of the basic features of neutrinos. Indeed, absolute scale\nand ordering of the masses of the three generations as well as charge\nconjugation and lepton number conservation properties are still unknown. In\nthis scenario, a unique role is played by the Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay\nsearches: these experiments can probe lepton number conservation, investigate\nthe Dirac/Majorana nature of the neutrinos and their absolute mass scale\n(hierarchy problem) with unprecedented sensitivity. Today Neutrinoless Double\nBeta Decay faces a new era where large scale experiments with a sensitivity\napproaching the so-called degenerate-hierarchy region are nearly ready to start\nand where the challenge for the next future is the construction of detectors\ncharacterized by a tonne-scale size and an incredibly low background, to fully\nprobe the inverted-hierarchy region.

At hadron colliders the dominant\nfraction of hits is due to low momentum tracks for which multiple scattering\n(MS) effects dominate the hit resolution. MS is also the dominating source for\nhit confusion and track uncertainties in low energy precision experiments. In\nall such environments, where MS dominates, track reconstruction and fitting can\nbe largely simplified by using three-dimensional (3D) hit-triplets as provided\nby pixel detectors. This simplification is possible since track uncertainties\nare solely determined by MS if high precision spatial information is provided.\nFitting of hit-triplets is especially simple for tracking detectors in\nsolenoidal magnetic fields. The over-constrained 3D-triplet method provides a\ncomplete set of track parameters and is robust against fake hit combinations.\nThe triplet method is ideally suited for pixel detectors where hits can be\ntreated as 3D-space points.

The goal\nof unfolding is to make nonparametric inferences about a particle spectrum from\nmeasurements smeared by the finite resolution of the particle detectors.\nPrevious unfolding methods use ad hoc discretization and regularization,\nresulting in confidence intervals that can have significantly lower coverage\nthan their nominal level. Instead of regularizing using a roughness penalty or\nstopping iterative methods early, we impose physically motivated shape\nconstraints: positivity, monotonicity, and convexity. We quantify the\nuncertainty by constructing a nonparametric confidence set for the true\nspectrum, consisting of all those spectra that satisfy the shape constraints\nand that predict the observations within an appropriately calibrated level of\nfit. Projecting that set produces simultaneous confidence intervals for all\nfunctionals of the spectrum, including averages within bins. The confidence\nintervals have guaranteed conservative frequentist finite-sample coverage in\nthe important and challenging class of unfolding problems for steeply falling\nparticle spectra.

Theoretical Framework Abstract: We develop a theoretical approach for nuclear spectral functions at high\nmissing momenta and removal energies based on the multi-nucleon short-range\ncorrelation~(SRC) model. The approach is based on the effective Feynman\ndiagrammatic method which allows to account for the relativistic effects\nimportant in the SRC domain. In addition to two-nucleon SRC with center of mass\nmotion we derive also the contribution of three-nucleon SRCs to the nuclear\nspectral functions. The latter is modeled based on the assumption that 3N SRCs\nare a product of two sequential short range NN interactions. This approach\nallowed us to express the 3N SRC part of the nuclear spectral function as a\nconvolution of two NN SRCs. Thus the knowledge of 2N SRCs allows us to model\nboth two- and three-nucleon SRC contributions to the spectral function. The\nderivations of the spectral functions are based on the two theoretical\nframeworks in evaluating covariant Feynman diagrams: In the first, referred as\nvirtual nucleon approximation, we reduce Feynman diagrams to the time ordered\nnoncovariant diagrams by evaluating nucleon spectators in the SRC at their\npositive energy poles, neglecting explicitly the contribution from vacuum\ndiagrams.

In this letter, we discuss three\ndifferent types of simplified models for this possible excess. In the first\nclass of models, we assume a new resonance couples to both b bar{b} and mu^+\nmu^-. Within the allowed parameter space for the ALEPH data, this type of\nmodels is excluded because of too large Drell-Yan production of dimuon from the\nb bar{b} collision at the LHC. In the second model, we assume that the 30 GeV\nexcess is a new gauge boson Z' that couples to the SM b and a new vectorlike\nsinglet B quark heavier than Z and not to b bar{b}. Then one can account for\nthe ALEPH data without conflict with the DY constraint. The new vectorlike\nquark B can be pair produced at the LHC 8/13 TeV by QCD with sigma(BB) ~\nO(100-1000) pb, and Bq production rate is sigma(Bq) ~ a few pb which is larger\nthan sigma(Bb) roughly by an order of magnitude. Their signatures at the LHC\nwould be 2b + 4mu, bj + 2mu and 2b + 2mu, respectively, which however might\nhave been excluded already by LHC run I and II data since the multi-muon events\nhave low SM background and are rare at the LHC. In the third model, we consider\nZ -> Z' phi followed by Z' -> mu^+ mu^- and phi -> b bar{b} assuming that the\nHiggs field for Z' mass is also charged under the SM U(1)_Y gauge symmetry. In\nthis class of model, we could accommodate the Br(Z -> b bar{b} mu^+ mu^-) ~ 1.1\nX 10^{-5} if we assume very large U(1)' charge for the U(1)' breaking Higgs\nfield.

Consequently, a valid\napproximation was to match the MSSM to the precision measurement directly at\nthe electroweak scale. This approach was also utilized by all dedicated\nspectrum generators for the MSSM. However, the higher the supersymmetric (SUSY)\nscale is, the bigger the uncertainties which are introduced by this matching.\nWe point out important consequences of a two-scale matching, where the running\nparameters within the SM are calculated at $M_Z$ and evaluated up to the SUSY\nscale, where they are matched to the full model. We show the impact on gauge\ncoupling unification as well as the SUSY mass spectrum.

One possibility\nwould be a spin-2 object called the colorphilic graviton--a spin-2\ncolor-singlet particle which couples exclusively to the quark and gluon\nstress-energy tensors. We assess the possibility of this state's discovery in\nthe dijet channel as an s-channel resonance, and report the regions of\nparameter space where colorphilic gravitons have not yet been excluded by\nLHC-13 data but still may be discovered in the dijet channel at LHC-14 for\nintegrated luminosities of 0.3, 1, and 3 ab$^{-1}$.

We\ndiscover that--despite the strong constraints unitarity imposes on collider\nsearches--the colorphilic graviton remains potentially discoverable in the LHC\ndijet channel.

The key point is the\nuse of a realistic probability distribution for each hit (heteroscedasticity).\nTwo different methods are used for the fits, the first method introduces an\neffective variance for each hit, the second method implements the maximum\nlikelihood search.

For this data we find an upper limit\non the sum of active neutrino mass eigenstates of \\sum m_nu < 1.0 eV (95%\nconf.), but this limit is dependent on priors. We find that the WMAP and 2dF\ndata alone cannot rule out the evidence from neutrinoless double beta decay\nreported by the Heidelberg-Moscow experiment. In terms of the relativistic\nenergy density in neutrinos or other weakly interacting species we find, in\nunits of the equivalent number of neutrino species, N_nu, that N_nu =\n4.0+3.0-2.1 (95% conf.). When BBN constraints are added, the bound on N_\\nu is\n2.6+0.4-0.3 (95% conf.), suggesting that N_nu could possibly be lower than the\nstandard model value of 3. This can for instance be the case in models with\nvery low reheating temperature and incomplete neutrino thermalization.\nConversely, if N_nu is fixed to 3 then the data from WMAP and 2dFGRS predicts\nthat 0.2458 < Y_P < 0.2471, which is significantly higher than the\nobservationally measured value. The limit on relativistic energy density\nchanges when a small $\\nu_e$ chemical potential is present during BBN. In this\ncase the upper bound on N_nu from WMAP, 2dFGRS and BBN is N_nu < 6.5. Finally,\nwe find that a non-zero \\sum m_nu can be compensated by an increase in N_nu.\nOne result of this is that the LSND result is not yet ruled out by cosmological\nobservations. \n\n"}

The neutron-neutron correlation function and the corresponding\nstatic structure factor are calculated from molecular dynamics simulations\ninvolving 40,000 to 100,000 nucleons. The static structure factor describes\ncoherent neutrino scattering which is expected to dominate the neutrino\nopacity. At low momentum transfers the static structure factor is found to be\nsmall because of ion screening. In contrast, at intermediate momentum transfers\nthe static structure factor displays a large peak due to coherent scattering\nfrom all the neutrons in a cluster. This peak moves to higher momentum\ntransfers and decreases in amplitude as the density increases. A large static\nstructure factor at zero momentum transfer, indicative of large density\nfluctuations during a first-order phase transition, may increase the neutrino\nopacity. However, no evidence of such an increase has been found. Therefore, it\nis unlikely that the system undergoes a simple first-order phase transition. It\nis found that corrections to the commonly used single heavy nucleus\napproximation first appear at a density of the order of $10^{13}$ g/cm$^3$ and\nincrease rapidly with increasing density.

The number of scalar states observed\nseems to exceed the number of states which can be accommodated in the quark\nmodel even when two states, the a_0(980) and f_0(980), are interpreted as K\nKbar bound states and are removed from the list. However, none of these states\nhas a decay pattern which is consistent with that of a pure glueball.

The f_0(1370) - a cornerstone of all qbar\nq-glueball mixing scenarios - is shown to be likely of non-qbar q nature. The\nremaining scalar states then do fit into a nonet classification.

The search for such a state was motivated by the recent\ndiscovery by the BaBar Collaboration of a narrow state at 2.32 GeV, the\nDsJ*(2317)+ that decays to Ds+pi0. Reconstructing the Ds+pi0 and Ds*+pi0 final\nstates in CLEO data, we observe peaks in both of the corresponding\nreconstructed mass difference distributions, dM(Dspi0)=M(Dspi0)-M(Ds) and\ndM(Ds*pi0)=M(Ds*pi0)-M(Ds*), both of them at values near 350 MeV. We interpret\nthese peaks as signatures of two distinct states, the DsJ*(2317)+ plus a new\nstate, designated as the DsJ(2463)+. Because of the similar dM values, each of\nthese states represents a source of background for the other if photons are\nlost, ignored or added. A quantitative accounting of these reflections confirms\nthat both states exist. We have measured the mean mass differences <dM(Dspi0)>\n= 350.0 +/- 1.2 [stat] +/- 1.0 [syst] MeV for the DsJ*(2317) state, and\n<dM(Ds*pi0)> = 351.2 +/- 1.7 [stat] +/- 1.0 [syst] MeV for the new DsJ(2463)+\nstate.

We find that the\nproper definition of the significance for <Nb>, <Ns> >> 1 is S_{12} =\nsqrt(<Ns>+<Nb>) - sqrt(<Nb>) in comparison with often used significances S_1 =\n<Ns>/sqrt(<Nb>) and S_2 = <N_s>/sqrt(<Ns> + <Nb>). We propose a method for\ntaking into account the systematical errors related to nonexact knowledge of\nbackground and signal cross sections. An account of such systematics is very\nessential in the search for supersymmetry at LHC. We also propose a method for\nestimation of exclusion limits on new physics in future experiments. \n\n"}
