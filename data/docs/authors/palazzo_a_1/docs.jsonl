The reason for that is\ntwofold: first, the active-sterile mixing angle that governs this oscillation\nis the less constrained by present experiments; second, this is the signal for\nwhich both OPERA and ICARUS have been designed, and thus benefits from an\nextremely low background. In our analysis we also took into account $\\nu_\\mu\n\\to \\nu_e$ oscillations.

The near-UV spectrum is dominated by very strong FeII and\nFeIII, and unusual low-ionization lines such as NaID and CaII H&K are observed.\nHigh-ionization lines are very weak; CIV has an equivalent width of 6.6A, a\nfactor of ~5 smaller than measured from quasar composite spectra.

For this purpose, we\nwork in the framework of the Hidden Local Symmetry (HLS) Lagrangian and modify\nthe vector meson mass term by including the pion and kaon loop contributions.\nThis leads us to define the physical rho, omega and phi fields as linear\ncombinations of their ideal partners, with coefficients being meromorphic\nfunctions of s, the square of the 4--momentum flowing into the vector meson\nlines. This allows us to define a dynamical, i.e. s-dependent, vector meson\nmixing scheme. The model is overconstrained by extending the framework in order\nto include the description of all meson radiative (V P gamma and P gamma gamma\ncouplings) and leptonic (Ve+e- couplings) decays and also the isospin breaking\n(omega/ phi --> pi+ pi-) decay modes. The model provides a simultaneous,\nconsistent and good description of the e+e- and tau dipion spectra. The\nexpression for pion form factor in the latter case is derived from those in the\nformer case by switching off the isospin breaking effects specific to e+e- and\nswitching on those for tau decays. Besides, the model also provides a good\naccount of all decay modes of the form V P gamma, Pgamma gamma as well as the\nisospin breaking decay modes.

In case Hubble induced A-terms are present for these two flat\ndirections, their initial values are determined completely by the potential and\nthere are no ambiguities how they are mixed. Moreover, CP is violated even when\nthe Hubble parameter is large due to the Hubble induced A-term and cross\ncoupling in F-term, so that the lepton asymmetry is generated just after the\nend of inflation. As a result, compared with the case of single flat direction,\nthe resultant lepton-to-entropy ratio is enhanced by a factor of\n$H_{osc}/m_{3/2}$, where $H_{osc}$ is the Hubble parameter at the onset of\noscillation and $m_{3/2}$ is the gravitino mass.

If we assume these cross sections are zero, then the standard\nsolar model including neutrino oscillations predicts a total capture rate in Ga\nin the range of 63-66 SNU with an uncertainty of about 4%, in good agreement\nwith experiment. We derive the current value of the neutrino flux produced in\nthe Sun by the proton-proton fusion reaction to be (6.0 +/- 0.8) x\n10^(10)/(cm^2 s), which agrees well with the pp flux predicted by the standard\nsolar model.

In particular we discuss how studying the energy spectra\nof each neutrino flavour coming from such distant sources and their distortion\nrelative to each other may serve as pointers to exotic physics such as neutrino\ndecay, Lorentz symmetry violation, pseudo-Dirac effects, CP and CPT violation\nand quantum decoherence. This allows us to probe hitherto unexplored ranges of\nparameters for the above cases, for example lifetimes in the range $\n10^{-3}-10^{4} $ s/eV for the case of neutrino decay. We show that standard\nneutrino oscillations ensure that the different flavours arrive at the earth\nwith similar shapes even if their flavour spectra at source may differ strongly\nin both shape and magnitude. As a result, observed differences between the\nspectra of various flavours at the detector would be signatures of non-standard\nphysics altering neutrino fluxes during propagation rather than those arising\nduring their production at source. Since detection of ultra-high energy (UHE)\nneutrinos is perhaps imminent, it is possible that such differences in spectral\nshapes will be tested in neutrino detectors in the near future.

We\ninvestigate this issue in the light of a perturbative framework that we have\nrecently developed, which allows for such nonlinearity at small scales. We\npropose a relatively straightforward \"dictionary\"---which is exact at the\nlinearized level---that maps Newtonian dust cosmologies into general\nrelativistic dust cosmologies, and we use our \"ordering scheme\" to determine\nthe degree to which the resulting metric and matter distribution solve\nEinstein's equation. We find that Einstein's equation fails to hold at \"order\n1\" at small scales and at \"order $\\epsilon$\" at large scales. We then find the\nadditional corrections to the metric and matter distribution needed to satisfy\nEinstein's equation to these orders. While these corrections are of some\ninterest in their own right, our main purpose in calculating them is that their\nsmallness should provide a criterion for the validity of the original\ndictionary (as well as simplified versions of this dictionary). We expect that,\nin realistic Newtonian cosmologies, these additional corrections will be very\nsmall; if so, this should provide strong justification for the use of Newtonian\nsimulations to describe relativistic cosmologies, even on scales larger than\nthe Hubble radius. \n\n"}

We consider two\ndetector technologies for atmospheric neutrinos - magnetized iron calorimeter\nand non-magnetized Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber.

For the long baseline experiments, a precise measurement of\ntheta_{13}, which can exclude degenerate solutions in the wrong octant,\nincreases the sensitivity drastically. For theta_{23} = 39^o and sin^2 2\ntheta_{13} = 0.1, at least ~2 sigma sensitivity can be achieved by T2K+NOvA for\nall values of delta_{CP} for both normal and inverted hierarchy. For\natmospheric neutrinos, the moderately large value of theta_{13} measured in the\nreactor experiments is conducive to octant sensitivity because of enhanced\nmatter effects. A magnetized iron detector can give a 2 sigma octant\nsensitivity for 500 kT yr exposure for theta_{23} = 39^o, delta_{CP} = 0 and\nnormal hierarchy.

This is due to a preference of different theta_{23} values at\nthe minimum chi^2 by T2K/NOvA and atmospheric neutrino experiments. A Liquid\nArgon detector for atmospheric neutrinos with the same exposure can give higher\noctant sensitivity, due to the interplay of muon and electron contributions and\nsuperior resolutions.

Today Neutrinoless Double\nBeta Decay faces a new era where large scale experiments with a sensitivity\napproaching the so-called degenerate-hierarchy region are nearly ready to start\nand where the challenge for the next future is the construction of detectors\ncharacterized by a tonne-scale size and an incredibly low background, to fully\nprobe the inverted-hierarchy region. A number of new proposed projects took up\nthis challenge. These are based either on large expansions of the present\nexperiments or on new ideas to improve the technical performance and/or reduce\nthe background contributions. n this paper, a review of the most relevant\nongoing experiments is given. The most relevant parameters contributing to the\nexperimental sensitivity are discussed and a critical comparison of the future\nprojects is proposed. \n\n"}

Several very promising processes to\nmeasure the gluon Sivers effect directly have been put forward, which apart\nfrom ongoing and future investigations at RHIC, would strongly favor\nexperiments at AFTER@LHC and a possible future Electron-Ion Collider. Due to\nthe inherent process dependence of TMDs, the gluon Sivers TMD probed in the\nvarious processes are not necessarily the same, but rather can be different\nlinear combinations of two universal gluon Sivers functions that have different\nbehavior under charge conjugation and that therefore satisfy different\ntheoretical constraints. For this reason both hadronic and DIS type of\ncollisions are essential in the study of the role of gluons in transversely\npolarized protons. \n\n"}

In this\npaper we show that a comprehensive way to study the remaining parameter\ndegeneracies is in the form of a generalized hierarchy-$\\theta_{23}$ -\n$\\delta_{CP}$ degeneracy. We show that the wrong-hierarchy and/or wrong-octant\nsolutions can be further classified into eight different solutions depending on\nwhether they occur with the wrong or right value of $\\delta_{CP}$. These eight\nsolutions are different from the original eightfold degenerate solutions and\ncan exist, in principle, even if $\\theta_{13}$ is known. These multiple\nsolutions, apart from affecting the determination of the true hierarchy and\noctant, also affect the accurate estimation of $\\delta_{CP}$.

To this end we calculate the masses and decay\nproperties of excited bottomonium states. We use the relativized quark model to\ncalculate the masses and wavefunctions and the $^3P_0$ quark-pair creation\nmodel to calculate decay widths to open bottom. We also summarize results for\nradiative transitions, annihilation decays, hadronic transitions and production\ncross sections which are used to develop strategies to find these states. We\nfind that the $b\\bar{b}$ system has a rich spectroscopy that we expect to be\nsubstantially extended by the LHC and $e^+e^-$ experiments in the near future.\nSome of the most promising possibilities at the LHC are observing the\n$\\chi_{b(1,2)}(3P)$, $\\chi_{b(1,2)}(4P)$ and $\\eta_b(3S)$ states in $\\gamma\n\\mu^+\\mu^-$ final states that proceed via radiative transitions through\n$\\Upsilon(nS)$ intermediate states and $1^3D_J$ and $2^3D_J$ into $\\gamma\\gamma\n\\mu^+\\mu^-$ final states proceeding via $1^3P_J\\to 1^3S_1$ and $2^3P_J\\to\n2^3S_1$ intermediate states respectively.

Now we turn to closed\nstrings, which should be the duals of glueballs. We look at the rotating folded\nclosed string in both flat and curved backgrounds.\n  A basic prediction of the closed string model is that the slope of Regge\ntrajectories is half that of open strings. We propose that a simple method to\nidentify glueballs is to look for resonances that belong to trajectories with a\nslope of approximately 0.45 GeV^-2, half the meson slope. We therefore look at\nthe experimental spectra of flavorless light mesons to see if such a scheme,\nwhere some of the states are placed on open string trajectories and some on\nclosed ones, can fit known experimental data. We look at the f_0 (J^PC = 0^++)\nand f_2 (2^++) resonances. As there is no preference for a single scheme of\nsorting the different states into meson and glueball trajectories, we present\nseveral possibilities, each identifying a different state as the glueball. We\nsupplement each scheme with predictions for the masses of excited glueballs.\n  We show that the width of the decay into two mesons is different for\nglueballs and mesons thus providing a supplementary tool to distinguish between\nthem. In addition, we look at some lattice QCD results for glueball spectra and\ncheck their compatibility with the closed string model.\n  One of the main conclusions of this paper is that an extension of\nexperimental data on the spectrum of flavorless hadrons is needed, in\nparticular in the region between around 2.4 GeV and 3 GeV. \n\n"}

The main improvements are the use of\nmore and better processed data and of Planck polarization data, and more\ndetailed foreground and instrumental models, allowing further checks and\nenhanced immunity to systematics. Progress in foreground modelling enables a\nlarger sky fraction. Improvements in processing and instrumental models further\nreduce uncertainties. For temperature, we perform an analysis of end-to-end\ninstrumental simulations fed into the data processing pipeline; this does not\nreveal biases from residual instrumental systematics. The $\\Lambda$CDM\ncosmological model continues to offer a very good fit to Planck data. The slope\nof primordial scalar fluctuations, $n_s$, is confirmed smaller than unity at\nmore than 5{\\sigma} from Planck alone.

Assuming that the mass of the additional singlet fermions is\nO(GeV) and color triplet fermions is O(TeV), we show that the modulus\ndominantly decays into the additional color triplet superfields. After soft\nsupersymmetry (SUSY) breaking, the lightest eigenstate of scalar component of\ncolor triplet superfield further decays into fermionic component of singlet\nsuperfield and quarks without violating baryon number. Assuming R-parity\nconservation, it follows that the singlet superfield will not further decay\ninto the SM particles and therefore it can be considered as a stable asymmetric\ndark matter (ADM) component. We find that the decay of the lightest eigenstate\nof scalar component of color triplet superfield gives the observed baryon\nasymmetry in the visible sector, an asymmetric dark matter component with the\nright abundance and naturally explains cosmic coincidence. \n\n"}

The T2K experiment observed electron-neutrino\nappearance in 2012. This observation enables T2K to explore CP violation in the\nlepton sector by comparing electron-neutrino appearance and\nelectron-antineutrino appearance. Indeed, the number of observed electron\nneutrino events up to 2012 is, though within statistical fluctuation, larger\nthan the expectation, which suggests maximal CP violation. Since 2013, T2K has\nbeen accumulating data with a muon antineutrino beam. If the suggested maximal\nCP violation is true, electron-antineutrino appearance would be suppressed. The\nsignal is further suppressed by the smaller cross section for antineutrinos\ncompared to neutrinos. Hence the observation of electron-antineutrino\nappearance is an important next step. Furthermore, the CPT theorem imposes that\nthe muon disappearance rate must be the same for muon neutrinos and muon\nantineutrinos; therefore the comparison between neutrinos and antineutrinos is\na good test of the CPT theorem, or else a probe for new non-standard\ninteractions of neutrinos with matter.

We show that it is\npossible to generate ultra-high-energy particles starting from particles with\nmoderate energies using the collisional Penrose process in an overspinning Kerr\nspacetime transcending the Kerr bound only by an infinitesimal amount, i.e.,\nwith the Kerr parameter $a=M(1+\\epsilon)$, where we take the limit $\\epsilon\n\\rightarrow 0^+$. We consider two massive particles starting from rest at\ninfinity that collide at $r=M$ with divergent center-of-mass energy and produce\ntwo massless particles. We show that massless particles produced in the\ncollision can escape to infinity with the ultra-high energies exploiting the\ncollisional Penrose process with the divergent efficiency $\\eta \\sim\n{1}/{\\sqrt{\\epsilon}} \\rightarrow \\infty$. Assuming the isotropic emission of\nmassless particles in the center-of-mass frame of the colliding particles, we\nshow that half of the particles created in the collisions escape to infinity\nwith the divergent energies. To a distant observer, ultra-high-energy particles\nappear to originate from a bright spot which is at the angular location $\\xi\n\\sim {2M}/{r_{obs}}$ with respect to the singularity on the side which is\nrotating towards the observer. We show that the anisotropy in emission in the\ncenter-of-mass frame, which is dictated by the differential cross-section of\nunderlying particle physics process, leaves a district signature on the\nspectrum of ultra-high-energy massless particles. Thus, it provides a unique\nprobe into fundamental particle physics. \n\n"}

The precise determination of octant and\n$\\delta_{CP}$ is interlinked through the octant-$\\delta_{CP}$ degeneracy. In\nthis paper we study the proficiency of the DUNE experiment to determine these\nparameters, in particular, the role played by the antineutrinos, the broadband\nnature of the beam and the matter effect. For $P_{\\mu e}$ and $P_{\\bar{\\mu}\n\\bar{e}}$ the octant-$\\delta_{CP}$ degeneracy occurs at different values of\n$\\delta_{CP}$, combination of neutrino and antineutrino runs help to resolve\nthis. However, in regions where neutrinos do not have octant degeneracy adding\nantineutrino data is expected to decrease the sensitivity because of the\ndegeneracy and reduced statistics. However we find that in case of DUNE\nbaseline, the antineutrino runs help even in parameter space where the\nantineutrino probabilities suffer from degeneracies. We explore this point in\ndetail and point out that this happens because of the (i) broad-band nature of\nthe beam so that even if there is degeneracy at a particular energy bin, over\nthe whole spectrum the degeneracy may not be there; (ii) the enhanced matter\neffect due to the comparatively longer baseline which creates an increased\ntension between the neutrino and the antineutrino probabilities which raises\nthe overall $\\chi^2$ in case of combined runs. This feature is more prominent\nfor IH since the antineutrino probabilities in this case are much higher than\nthe neutrino probabilities due to matter effects.

We show that a pseudoscalar\naxion coupled to the topological density of hypercharge, suggested in the past\nby Brustein and Oaknin as a candidate for inducing baryogenesis, can explain\nthe signal in the diphoton channel. The hypercharge axion (HCA) can also decay\nto $Z\\gamma$ and $ZZ$. The expected number of events in these channels is too\nsmall to have been detected, but such decays should be observed in the future.\nThe HCA can be produced via vector boson fusion (VBF) or via associated\nproduction (AP). The latter should be manifested by a characteristic decay to 3\nphotons which should be observed soon. We adapt the previous analysis of\npossible detection of the HCA at the LHC by Brustein and Oaknin and by Elfgren\nto the case that the mass of the HCA is 750 GeV and find the expected cross\nsection and decay width in terms of the HCA coupling.

The tension is caused because for both VBF and AP the production\ncross-section and the decay width depend linearly on each other.

We derive constraints from a combination of current and future\ncosmological datasets on the total neutrino mass $M_\\nu$ and on the mass\nfractions carried by each of the mass eigenstates, after marginalizing over the\n(unknown) neutrino mass ordering, either normal (NH) or inverted (IH). The\nbounds take therefore into account the uncertainty related to our ignorance of\nthe mass hierarchy. This novel approach is carried out in the framework of\nBayesian analysis of a typical hierarchical problem. In this context, the\nchoice of the neutrino mass ordering is modeled via the discrete hyperparameter\n$h_{type}$. The preference for either the NH or the IH scenarios is then\nencoded in the posterior distribution of $h_{type}$ itself. Current CMB\nmeasurements assign equal odds to the two hierarchies, and are thus unable to\ndistinguish between them. However, after the addition of BAO measurements, a\nweak preference for NH appears, with odds of 4:3 from Planck temperature and\nlarge-scale polarization in combination with BAO (3:2 if small-scale\npolarization is also included).

We constrain this scenario using the\nlatest Planck data on Cosmic Microwave Background anisotropies, and\nmeasurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). We consistently include the\neffect of secret interactions on cosmological perturbations, namely the\nincreased density and pressure fluctuations in the neutrino fluid, and still\nfind a severe tension between the secret interaction framework and cosmology.\nIn fact, taking into account neutrino scattering via secret interactions, we\nderive our own mass bound on sterile neutrinos and find (at 95% CL) $m_s <\n0.82$ eV or $m_s < 0.29$ eV from Planck alone or in combination with BAO,\nrespectively. These limits confirm the discrepancy with the laboratory\nanomalies. Moreover, we constrain, in the limit of contact interaction, the\neffective strength $G_X$ to be $ < 2.8 (2.0) \\times 10^{10}\\,G_F$ from Planck\n(Planck+BAO).

For precise determinations of parameters like the\nelectroweak gauge couplings or the mass of the top quark, efficient, unbiased,\nand theoretically unambiguous analysis methods are needed. Within this context,\nthe Matrix Element Method (MEM) has been established in hadron collider\nanalyses due to its possibility to top out at utilising the information\navailable in experimental data.

Moreover, the values of the Bayes factor indicate\nthat the evidence for NO is strong only when the scan is performed over the\nthree neutrino masses with logarithmic priors; for every other combination of\nparameterization and prior, the preference for NO is only weak. As a by-product\nof our Bayesian analyses, we are able to a) compare the Bayesian bounds on the\nneutrino mixing parameters to those obtained by means of frequentist\napproaches, finding a very good agreement; b) determine that the lightest\nneutrino mass plus the two mass splittings parametrization, motivated by the\nphysical observables, is strongly preferred over the three neutrino mass\neigenstates scan and c) find that there is a weak-to-moderate preference for\nlogarithmic priors.

If\nthis is the case, there is the possibility that there might be three body bound\nstates with two charmed mesons and a charmed antimeson. Here we argue that the\ntheoretical existence of this type of three body molecules is expected from\nheavy quark spin symmetry. If applied to the two body sector, this symmetry\nimplies that the interaction of the $D^{*0} \\bar{D}^{*0}$ meson-antimeson pair\nin the $J^{PC} = 2^{++}$ channel is the same as in the $J^{PC} = 1^{++}$\n$D^{*0} \\bar{D}^0$ case.

That is, it can also have a geometric spectrum.

We concentrate on radiative neutrino scattering on atomic electrons\n(or on free electrons in a conductor). Such processes can be coherent provided\nthat the net electron recoil momentum, i.e. the momentum transfer from the\nneutrino minus the momentum of the emitted photon, is sufficiently small. The\nradiative processes is an attractive possibility as the energy of the emitted\nphotons can be as large as the momentum transfer to the electron system and\ntherefore the problem of detecting extremely low energy recoils can be avoided.\nThe requirement of macroscopic coherence severely constrains the phase space\navailable for the scattered particle and the emitted photon. We show that in\nthe case of the scattering mediated by the usual weak neutral current and\ncharged current interactions this leads to a strong suppression of the\nelementary cross sections and therefore the requirement of macroscopic\ncoherence results in a reduction rather than an increase of the total detection\ncross section. However, for the $\\nu e$ scattering mediated by neutrino\nmagnetic or electric dipole moments coherence effects can actually increase the\ndetection rates. Effects of macroscopic coherence can also allow detection of\nneutrinos in 100 eV -- a few keV energy range, which is currently not\naccessible to the experiment.

In the hard state, the variability can be\nexplained by softening the overall spectrum with a pivot at 50 keV and another,\nindependent variability pattern where the spectral shape does not change when\nthe luminosity changes. In the soft state, the variability is caused by a\nvariable hard tail of a constant shape superimposed on a constant soft\ncomponent. These variability patterns are in agreement with the\nenergy-dependent rms variability in the two states. We also study in detail\nrecent soft states in 2000-02. The last of them has lasted so far for >200\ndays. Their spectra are harder in the 1.5-5 keV band but similar or in the 3-12\nkeV band than those of the 1996 soft state whereas the rms variability is\nstronger in all the ASM bands. On the other hand, the 1994 soft state\ntransition observed by BATSE appears very similar to the 1996 one. We interpret\nthe variability patterns by theoretical Comptonization models.

However, the smallness of the observed reflection component in Cygnus\nX-1, in addition to other constraints, seem to rule out the two-phase model\n(otherwise successful in the case of Seyfert Galaxies) for GBHCs. Here, we show\nthat the latter conclusion is based on a number of key assumptions that\nprobably are not valid when the overlying corona is patchy, e.g., when it is\ncomprised of localized magnetic flares above the disk. We show that in GBHCs\nthe energy deposited by the X-rays cannot be re-radiated fast enough to\nmaintain equilibrium, unless the X-ray skin heats up to the Compton\ntemperature, at which point the gas is mostly ionized. This leads to a\nsubstantially reduced cooling rate for the active regions due to the\ncorrespondingly smaller number of re-injected low-energy photons. We model this\neffect by introducing a transition layer situated between the corona and the\ncold disk, and find that the resulting spectrum is harder than that obtained\nwith the standard (and unrealistic) two-phase model. We apply this model to\nCygnus X-1 and show that it can account for its observed spectrum.

Kaiser, Squires, & Broadhurst (1995) proposed a method to calibrate\nthe ellipticity-shear relation in the presence of Point Spread Function (PSF)\nanisotropies and camera distortions. We revisit the KSB method and show that\nboth the PSF and the camera distortions can be corrected for using source\nmoments, as opposed to ellipticities. We clarify the applicability of some of\nthe approximations made in this method. We derive expressions for the\ncorrections which only involve the galaxy moments. We derive an explicit\nrelation between the shear and the average ellipticity. We discuss the\nshortcomings of the method, and test its validity using numerical simulations.\nAs an application of the method, we repeat the analysis of the HST WFPC2 camera\nperformed by Hoekstra et al.

The favored\nsolutions are LMA, LOW, and VAC in order of g.o.f. The neutral current to\ncharged current ratio for SNO is predicted to be 3.5 +- 0.6 (1 sigma), which is\nseparated from the no-oscillation value of 1.0 by much more than the expected\nexperimental error. The predicted range of the day-night difference in charged\ncurrent rates is (8.2 +- 5.2)% and is strongly correlated with the day-night\neffect for neutrino-electron scattering. A measurement by SNO of either a NC to\nCC ratio > 3.3 or a day-night difference > 10%, would favor a small region of\nthe currently allowed LMA neutrino parameter space.

{"id": "physics/0608025", "contents": "Title: Geo-neutrinos: A systematic approach to uncertainties and correlations Abstract: Geo-neutrinos emitted by heat-producing elements (U, Th and K) represent a\nunique probe of the Earth interior. The characterization of their fluxes is\nsubject, however, to rather large and highly correlated uncertainties. The\ngeochemical covariance of the U, Th and K abundances in various Earth\nreservoirs induces positive correlations among the associated geo-neutrino\nfluxes, and between these and the radiogenic heat. Mass-balance constraints in\nthe Bulk Silicate Earth (BSE) tend instead to anti-correlate the radiogenic\nelement abundances in complementary reservoirs. Experimental geo-neutrino\nobservables may be further (anti)correlated by instrumental effects. In this\ncontext, we propose a systematic approach to covariance matrices, based on the\nfact that all the relevant geo-neutrino observables and constraints can be\nexpressed as linear functions of the U, Th and K abundances in the Earth's\nreservoirs (with relatively well-known coefficients). We briefly discuss here\nthe construction of a tentative \"geo-neutrino source model\" (GNSM) for the U,\nTh, and K abundances in the main Earth reservoirs, based on selected\ngeophysical and geochemical data and models (when available), on plausible\nhypotheses (when possible), and admittedly on arbitrary assumptions (when\nunavoidable). We use then the GNSM to make predictions about several\nexperiments (\"forward approach\"), and to show how future data can constrain - a\nposteriori - the error matrix of the model itself (\"backward approach\"). The\nmethod may provide a useful statistical framework for evaluating the impact and\nthe global consistency of prospective geo-neutrino measurements and Earth\nmodels. \n\n"}
