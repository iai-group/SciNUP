Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie. Therefore, it\nis still possible that planets exist around main sequence stars in globular\nclusters, although at small numbers because of the low metallicity, and at\norbital periods of >~10 days. We discuss the implications of our conclusions on\nthe role that companions can play in the evolution of their parent stars in\nglobular clusters, e.g., influencing the distribution of horizontal branch\nstars on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of some globular clusters, and in\nforming low mass white dwarfs. \n\n"}

Our approach\ncontains one free parameter, the lifetime of a protostellar object t_yso (Class\n0 + Class I stages), which is outside the realm of the simulations. Assuming a\nvalue t_yso = 0.46 Myr, we obtain number ratios of starless to stellar cores\nranging from 4-5 at n_thr = 1.5 x 10^4 cm^-3 to 1 at n_thr = 1.2 x 10^5 cm^-3,\nagain in good agreement with observational determinations.

The galaxy is known to possess a dramatic 70 kpc\nX-ray tail. The detected H-alpha tail coincides positionally with the X-ray\ntail. The H-alpha emission in the galaxy is sharply truncated on the front and\nthe sides near the nucleus, indicating significant ram pressure stripping. ESO\n137-001 is thus the first cluster late-type galaxy known unambiguously with\nboth an X-ray tail and an H-alpha tail. The emission-line objects are all\ndistributed downstream of the galaxy, with projected distance up to 39 kpc from\nthe galaxy. From the analysis on the H-alpha_{off} frame and the estimate of\nthe background emission-line objects, we conclude that it is very likely all 29\nemission-line objects are HII regions in A3627. The high surface number density\nand luminosities of these HII regions (up to 10^40 ergs/s) dwarf the previously\nknown examples of isolated HII regions in clusters.

As a first\napplication, we estimate the impact of non-radial effects on excitation rates\nand amplitudes of high-angular-degree modes which are observed on the Sun. A\nmodel of stochastic excitation by turbulent convection has been developed to\ncompute the excitation rates, and it has been successfully applied to solar\nradial modes (Samadi & Goupil 2001, Belkacem et al. 2006b). We generalize this\napproach to the case of non-radial global modes. This enables us to estimate\nthe energy supplied to high-($\\ell$) acoustic modes. Qualitative arguments as\nwell as numerical calculations are used to illustrate the results. We find that\nnon-radial effects for $p$ modes are non-negligible:\n  - for high-$n$ modes (i.e. typically $n > 3$) and for high values of $\\ell$;\nthe power supplied to the oscillations depends on the mode inertia.\n  - for low-$n$ modes, independent of the value of $\\ell$, the excitation is\ndominated by the non-diagonal components of the Reynolds stress term.

The three stages involves a neutron star phase, a quark star (QS)\nand a black hole phase as described in Staff et al. (2007). We find that the QS\nstage allows for more energy to be extracted from neutron star to QS conversion\nas well as from ensuing accretion onto the QS. The QS accretion phase naturally\nextends the engine activity and can account for both the prompt emission and\nirregular early X-ray afterglow activity. Following the accretion phase, the QS\ncan spin-down by emission of a baryon-free outflow. The magnetar-like magnetic\nfield strengths resulting from the NS to QS transition provide enough spin-down\nenergy, for the correct amount of time, to account for the plateau in the X-ray\nafterglow.

Cosmic evolution of the space density of FRI radio sources Abstract: In this paper the cosmic evolution of the space density of Fanaroff & Riley\nClass I (FRI) radio sources is investigated out to z ~ 1, in order to\nunderstand the origin of the differences between these and the more powerful\nFRIIs. High resolution radio images are presented of the best high redshift FRI\ncandidate galaxies, drawn from two fields of the Leiden Berkeley Deep Survey,\nand previously defined in Rigby, Snellen & Best (2007, Paper I). Together with\nlower resolution radio observations (both previously published in Paper I and,\nfor a subset of sources, also presented here) these are used to morphologically\nclassify the sample. Sources which are clearly resolved are classified by\nmorphology alone, whereas barely or unresolved sources were classified using a\ncombination of morphology and flux density loss in the higher resolution data,\nindicative of resolved out extended emission. The space densities of the FRIs\nare then calculated as a function of redshift, and compared to both\nmeasurements of the local value and the behaviour of the more powerful FRIIs.\nThe space density of FRI radio sources with luminosities (at 1.4 GHz) > 10^25\nW/Hz is enhanced by a factor of 5-9 by z ~ 1, implying moderately strong\nevolution of this population; this enhancement is in good agreement with models\nof FRII evolution at the same luminosity.

The photo-z error behaviour was analysed to\nselect cleaner subsamples with more secure photo-z estimates. We consider\nHyperz, BPZ, and the code used in the CADIS, COMBO-17, and HIROCS surveys.\nResults. The photo-z error estimates of the three codes do not correlate\ntightly with the accuracy of the photo-z's. While very large errors sometimes\nindicate a true catastrophic photo-z failure, smaller errors are usually not\nmeaningful. For any given dataset, we find significant differences in redshift\naccuracy and outlier rates between the different codes when compared to\nspectroscopic redshifts.

We\nhave simulated five dust models plus a radiative cooling and adiabatic models\nusing the same initial conditions for all runs. The numerical implementation of\ndust was based on the analytical computations of Montier and Giard (2004). We\nset up dust simulations to cover different combinations of dust parameters that\nput in evidence the effects of size and abundance of dust grains. Comparing our\nradiative plus dust cooling runs to a purely radiative cooling simulation we\nfind that dust has an impact on cluster scaling relations. It mainly affects\nthe normalisation of the scalings (and their evolution), whereas it introduces\nno significant differences on their slopes. The strength of the effect depends\ncritically on the dust abundance and grain size parameters as well as on the\ncluster scaling. Indeed, cooling due to dust is effective at the cluster regime\nand has a stronger effect on the \"baryon driven\" statistical properties of\nclusters such as $L_{\\rm X}-M$, $Y- M$, $S-M$ scaling relations. Major\ndifferences, relative to the radiative cooling model, are as high as 25% for\nthe $L_{\\rm X}-M$ normalisation, and about 10% for the $Y-M$ and $S-M$\nnormalisations at redshift zero. On the other hand, we find that dust has\nalmost no impact on the \"dark matter driven\" $T_{\\rm mw}-M$ scaling relation.\nThe effects are found to be dependent in equal parts on both dust abundances\nand grain sizes distributions for the scalings investigated in this paper.\nHigher dust abundances and smaller grain sizes cause larger departures from the\nradiative cooling (i.e. with no dust) model. \n\n"}

Such discs\nshould arise frequently, but should be observed infrequently, precisely because\nthey fragment rapidly. By performing an ensemble of radiation-hydrodynamic\nsimulations, we show that such discs fragment within a few thousand years, and\nproduce mainlybrown dwarf (BDs) stars, but also planetary mass (PM) stars and\nvery low-mass hydrogen-burning (HB) stars. Most of the the PM stars and BDs are\nejected by mutual interactions. We analyse the statistical properties of these\nstars, and compare them with observations. After a few hundred thousand years\nthe Sun-like primary is typically left with a close low-mass HB companion, and\ntwo much wider companions: a low-mass HB star and a BD star, or a BD-BD binary.\nThere is a BD desert extending out to at least ~100 AU; this is because BDs\ntend to be formed further out than low-mass HB stars, and then they tend to be\nscattered even further out, or even into the field. BDs form with discs of a\nfew Mj and radii of a few tens of AU, and they are more likely to retain these\ndiscs if they remain bound to the primary star. Binaries form by pairing of the\nnewly-formed stars in the disc, giving a low-mass binary fraction of ~0.16.\nThese binaries include close and wide BD/BD binaries and BD/PM binaries. BDs\nthat remain as companions to Sun-like stars are more likely to be in BD/BD\nbinaries than are BDs ejected into the field. Disc fragmentation is a robust\nmechanism; even if only a small fraction of Sun-like stars host the required\nmassive extended discs,this mechanism can produce all the PM stars observed,\nmost of the BD stars, and a significant proportion of the very low-mass HB\nstars. \n\n"}

This is clearly too long to be\nassociated with radiative cooling. Here we propose that this may be the\nsignature of deceleration of the synchrotron emitting jet component.

A robust prediction of this model, which can be\ntested with Fermi and simultaneous optical monitoring, is that the peak in the\ngamma-ray light curve at ~ 100 MeV is expected to be delayed by a few days with\nrespect to the onset of the optical decay, while the VHE gamma-rays are\nexpected to track the optical light curve closely with a delay of at most a few\nhours. \n\n"}

Each halo is resolved with ~ 10^8 particles (at a mass\nresolution ~ 10^3-4 M_sun/h) within its virial radius. Subhaloes with masses\nlarger than 10^5 M_sun/h are well resolved, an improvement of at least two\norders of magnitude over previous lensing studies. We incorporate a baryonic\ncomponent modelled as a Hernquist profile and account for the response of the\ndark matter via adiabatic contraction. We focus on the \"anomalous\" flux ratio\nproblem, in particular on the violation of the cusp-caustic relation due to\nsubstructures. We find that subhaloes with masses less than ~ 10^8 M_sun/h play\nan important role in causing flux anomalies; such low mass subhaloes have been\nunresolved in previous studies. There is large scatter in the predicted flux\nratios between different haloes and between different projections of the same\nhalo. In some cases, the frequency of predicted anomalous flux ratios is\ncomparable to that observed for the radio lenses, although in most cases it is\nnot.

Abstract: A broad continuum excess in the near-infrared, peaking in the rest-frame at\n2-5 micron, is detected in a spectroscopic sample of 88 galaxies at 0.5<z<2.0\ntaken from the Gemini Deep Deep Survey. Line emission from polycyclic aromatic\nhydrocarbons (PAHs) at 3.3 micron alone cannot explain the excess, which can be\nfit by a spectral component consisting of a template of PAH emission lines\nsuperposed on a modified blackbody of temperature T~850 K. The luminosity of\nthis near-infrared excess emission at 3 micron is found to be correlated with\nthe star formation rate of the galaxy. The origin of the near-infrared excess\nis explored by examining similar excesses observed locally in massive star\nforming regions, reflection and planetary nebulae, post-asymptotic giant branch\nstars and in the galactic cirrus.

We discuss the possibility and theoretical aspects\nof using Lyman alpha emission properties of long GRB host galaxies as a\nmetallicity indicator of high redshift GRB environments, where direct\nmetallicity measurements are not easy. We propose to use the fraction of\nLy-alpha emitters (LAEs) in long GRB host galaxies as a function of UV\nluminosity, which can be compared with star-formation-rate weighted LAE\nfraction of Lyman-break galaxies as the standard in the case of no metallicity\ndependence. There are two important effects of metallicity dependence of long\nGRB rate to change the LAE fraction of host galaxies. One is the enhancement of\nintrinsic Ly-alpha equivalent width (EW) by stronger ionizing UV luminosity of\nlow metallicity stellar population, and the other is extinction by interstellar\ndust to change the observable EW. Based on a latest theoretical model of LAEs\nthat reproduce observations, we argue that the latter is likely to work in the\nopposite direction to the former, i.e., to decrease LAE fraction if GRBs\npreferentially occur in low-metallicity environments, because of the clumpy\ninter-stellar medium effect. The high LAE fraction of GRB host galaxies\nindicated by observations is quantitatively be explained by the LAE model if\nGRBs occur when Z < 0.1Z_sun, although this result is still indicative because\nof the limited statistics and theoretical uncertainties.

Assuming that the initial BH seeds are relatively massive, of the\norder of 10^5 Msun, and that seeding occurs around z~15 in dark matter haloes\nof mass 10^9-10^10 Msun, we find that it is possible to build up supermassive\nBHs (SMBHs) by z=6 that assemble most of their mass during extended\nEddington-limited accretion periods. The properties of the simulated SMBHs are\nconsistent with observations of z=6 quasars in terms of the estimated BH masses\nand bolometric luminosities, the amount of star formation occurring within the\nhost halo, and the presence of highly enriched gas in the innermost regions of\nthe host galaxy.

This will allow the detection of gravitational waves\ngenerated in binary systems containing black holes of intermediate mass, ~\n100-1000 solar masses.

The high equivalent widths of the lines imply a high BLR covering\nfactor, and the absence of clear evidence for absorption by the BLR means that\nthe BLR has a flattened distribution and that we always view it near pole-on.\nThe BLR gas is strongly self-shielding near the equatorial plane.\nVelocity-resolved reverberation mapping has long strongly excluded significant\noutflow of the BLR and shows instead that the predominant motions are Keplerian\nwith large turbulence and a significant net inflow. The rotation and turbulence\nare consistent with the inferred geometry. The blueshifting of high-ionization\nlines is a consequence of scattering off inflowing material rather than the\nresult of an outflowing wind. The rate of inflow of the BLR is sufficient to\nprovide the accretion rate needed to power the AGN. Because the motions of the\nBLR are gravitationally dominated, and the BLR structure is very similar in\nmost AGNs, consistent black hole masses can be determined. The good correlation\nbetween these estimates and masses predicted from the bulge luminosities of\nhost galaxies provides strong support for the similarity of AGN continuum\nshapes and the correctness of the BLR picture presented.

This is likely because of the decrease in star\nformation activity and in wind escape efficiency. Metals enhance cooling which\nallows WHIM gas to cool onto galaxies and increases star formation. Metal\ndiffusion allows winds to mix prior to escape, decreasing the IGM metal content\nin favour of gas within galactic halos and star forming gas. Diffusion\nsignificantly increases the amount of gas with low metallicities and changes\nthe density-metallicity relation. \n\n"}

The campaign consists of 7 observations. We analyze the\nresponse in the opacity of the gas that forms the ionized absorber to ionizing\nflux variations. Despite variations by a factor of 4 in the impinging\ncontinuum, the soft X-ray spectra of the source show little spectral\nvariations, suggesting no response from the ionized absorber. A detailed time\nmodeling confirms the lack of opacity variations for an absorbing component\nwith high ionization. Instead, the models tentatively suggest that the\nionization parameter of a low ionization absorbing component might be changing\nwith the ionizing flux, as expected for gas in photoionization equilibrium.\nUsing the lack of variations, we set an upper limit of n_e <2.0E7 cm-3 for the\nelectron density of the gas forming the high ionization, high velocity\ncomponent. This implies a large distance from the continuum source (R > 0.033\npc). If the variations in the low ionization component are real, they imply n_e\n>9.8E4 cm-3 and R < 3 pc. We discuss our results in terms of two different\nscenarios: a large scale outflow originating in the inner parts of the\naccretion disk, or a thermally driven wind originating much farther out.

Abstract: It is generally assumed that the central galaxy in a dark matter halo, that\nis, the galaxy with the lowest specific potential energy, is also the brightest\nhalo galaxy (BHG), and that it resides at rest at the centre of the dark matter\npotential well. This central galaxy paradigm (CGP) is an essential assumption\nmade in various fields of astronomical research. In this paper we test the\nvalidity of the CGP using a large galaxy group catalogue constructed from the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey. For each group we compute two statistics, ${\\cal R}$\nand ${\\cal S}$, which quantify the offsets of the line-of-sight velocities and\nprojected positions of brightest group galaxies relative to the other group\nmembers. By comparing the cumulative distributions of $|{\\cal R}|$ and $|{\\cal\nS}|$ to those obtained from detailed mock group catalogues, we rule out the\nnull-hypothesis that the CGP is correct. Rather, the data indicate that in a\nnon-zero fraction $f_{\\rm BNC}(M)$ of all haloes of mass $M$ the BHG is not the\ncentral galaxy, but instead, a satellite galaxy.

The approach is to consider a\none-parameter-family of solutions to the field equations satisfying certain\nassumptions designed to reflect the existence of a body whose size, mass, and\nvarious charges are simultaneously scaled to zero. (That such solutions exist\nplaces a further restriction on the class of theories to which our results\napply.) Assumptions are made only on the spacetime region outside of the body,\nso that the results apply to ordinary bodies as well as black holes. The\nworldline \"left behind\" by the shrinking, disappearing body is interpreted as\nits lowest-order motion. An equation for this worldline follows from the\n\"Bianchi identity\" for the theory, without use of any properties of the field\nequations beyond their being second-order.

We identify significant\nsystematic effects in this procedure that can artificially induce an additional\ndiffuse component with a morphology strikingly similar to the claimed gamma-ray\nhaze. To quantitatively illustrate this point we calculate sky-maps of the\nratio of the gamma-ray emission from neutral pions to the ISM column density,\nand of IC to synchrotron emission, using detailed galactic cosmic-ray models\nand simulations. In the region above and below the galactic center, the ISM\ntemplate underestimates the gamma-ray emission due to neutral pion decay by\napproximately 20%.

Based upon our recent\npublication on the problem of gravitational collapse in the physical universe\nfor an external observer, the following results are reported here: (1) Matter\ncan indeed fall across the event horizon within a finite time and thus BHs,\nrather than \"frozen stars\", are formed in gravitational collapse in the\nphysical universe. (2) Matter fallen into an astrophysical black hole can never\narrive at the exact center; the exact interior distribution of matter depends\nupon the history of the collapse process.

After correcting for systematic effects,\nwe fitted the light curves using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique.\nCombining these new data with the EPOXI, HST and ground-based $V, I, H$ and\n$K_s$ published observations, the range $0.5-10~\\mu$m can be covered. Due to\nthe low level of activity of GJ436, the effect of starspots on the combination\nof transits at different epochs is negligible at the accuracy of the dataset.\nRepresentative climate models were calculated by using a three-dimensional,\npseudo-spectral general circulation model with idealised thermal forcing.\nSimulated transit spectra of GJ436b were generated using line-by-line radiative\ntransfer models including the opacities of the molecular species expected to be\npresent in such a planetary atmosphere.

The photometric data observed\nat multiple wavelengths can be interpreted with methane being the dominant\nabsorption after molecular hydrogen, possibly with minor contributions from\nammonia, water and other molecules.

The source, with a peak luminosity of L_x=2x10^39 ergs/s, reveals an\norder of magnitude change in the count rate within ~10 ks in a Chandra\nobservation. The BH resides in a metal-rich [Fe/H]~0.2 globular cluster. After\nRZ2109 in NGC 4472 this is only the second black-hole X-ray source in a GC\nconfirmed via rapid X-ray variability. Unlike RZ2109, the X-ray spectrum of\nthis BH source did not change during the period of rapid variability. In\naddition to the short-term variability the source also exhibits long-term\nvariability. After being bright for at least a decade since 1993 within a span\nof 2 years it became progressively fainter, and eventually undetectable, or\nmarginally detectable, in deep Chandra and XMM observations. The source also\nbecame harder as it faded. The characteristics of the long term variability in\nitself provide sufficient evidence to identify the source as a BH. The long\nterm decline in the luminosity of this object was likely not recognized in\nprevious studies because the rapid variability within the bright epoch\nsuppressed the average luminosity in that integration.

Inefficient fueling (and/or\nfeedback) from fast stellar winds has been invoked to explain this, but we\nargue this is unlikely in bright systems accreting primarily cold dense gas. We\nshow that such a delay can arise even in bright quasars for purely dynamical\nreasons. If some large-scale process produces rapid inflow, smaller scales will\nquickly become gas-dominated. As the gas density peaks, so does the SFR.\nHowever, gravitational torques which govern further inflow are relatively\ninefficient in gas-dominated systems; as more gas is turned into stars, the\nstars provide an efficient angular momentum sink allowing more rapid inflow.\nMoreover, the gas provided to the central regions in mergers or strong disk\ninstabilities will typically be ~100 times larger than that needed to fuel the\nBH; the system is effectively in the 'infinite gas supply' limit. BH growth can\ntherefore continue for some time while the gas supply exhausts, until it has\nsignificantly depleted to the point where the BH is finally 'starved.' Both of\nthese effects act together with comparable magnitude, and mean that the peak of\nBH growth can lag the peak in the SFR measured at a given scale by a timescale\ncorresponding to the gas exhaustion time on that scale (~ 10-100 local\ndynamical times).

In this paper, the first in a series, we present and test a novel\nnumerical implementation of stellar feedback resulting from momentum imparted\nto the ISM by radiation, supernovae, and stellar winds. We employ a realistic\ncooling function, and find that a large fraction of the gas cools to <100K, so\nthat the ISM becomes highly inhomogeneous. Despite this, our simulated galaxies\nreach an approximate steady state, in which gas gravitationally collapses to\nform giant molecular clouds (GMCs), dense clumps, and stars; subsequently,\nstellar feedback disperses the GMCs, repopulating the diffuse ISM. This\ncollapse and dispersal cycle is seen in models of SMC-like dwarfs, the\nMilky-Way, and z~2 clumpy disk analogues. The simulated global star formation\nefficiencies are consistent with the observed Kennicutt-Schmidt relation.\nMoreover, the star formation rates are nearly independent of the numerically\nimposed high-density star formation efficiency, density threshold, and density\nscaling. This is a consequence of the fact that, in our simulations, star\nformation is regulated by stellar feedback limiting the amount of very dense\ngas available for forming stars. In contrast, in simulations without stellar\nfeedback, i.e. under the action of only gravity and gravitationally-induced\nturbulence, the ISM experiences runaway collapse to very high densities. In\nthese simulations without feedback, the global star formation rates exceed\nobserved galactic star formation rates by 1-2 orders of magnitude,\ndemonstrating that stellar feedback is crucial to the regulation of star\nformation in galaxies. \n\n"}

Self-consistent\nphotoionization models provide good descriptions of the spectra of the large\nscale emission, as well as resolved structures, supporting the dominant role of\nnuclear photoionization, although displacement of optical and X-ray features\nimplies a more complex medium. Collisionally ionized emission is estimated to\nbe <12% of the extended emission.

Most significantly, we find that deeper luminosity cuts can\nreduce the recovered scatter, finding that sigma_lnLX|lambda=0.63+/-0.02 for\nclusters with M_500c >~ 1.6e14 h_70^-1 M_sun. The corresponding scatter in mass\nat fixed richness is sigma_lnM|lambda ~ 0.2-0.3 depending on the richness,\ncomparable to that for total X-ray luminosity. We find that including blue\ngalaxies in the richness estimate increases the scatter, as does weighting\ngalaxies by their optical luminosity. We further demonstrate that our richness\nestimator is very robust. Specifically, the filter employed when estimating\nrichness can be calibrated directly from the data, without requiring a-priori\ncalibrations of the red-sequence. We also demonstrate that the recovered\nrichness is robust to up to 50% uncertainties in the galaxy background, as well\nas to the choice of photometric filter employed, so long as the filters span\nthe 4000 A break of red-sequence galaxies.

We study the impact of this effect on\nthe star formation history of galaxies. We incorporate metallicity-dependent\nstar formation and metal enrichment in a simple model that follows the\nevolution of a halo main progenitor. Our model shows that including the effect\nof metallicity leads to suppression of star formation at redshift z>2 in dark\nhalos with masses <~ 10^11 Msun, with the suppression becoming near total for\nhalos below ~10^9.5-10 Msun. We find that at high redshift the SFR cannot catch\nup with the gas inflow rate (IR), because the SFR is limited by the free-fall\ntime, and because it is suppressed further by a lack of metals. As a result, in\neach galaxy the SFR is growing in time faster than the IR, and the integrated\ncosmic SFR density is rising with time. The suppressed in situ SFR at high z\nmakes the growth of stellar mass dominated by ex situ SFR which implies that\nthe specific SFR (sSFR) remains constant with time. The intensely accreted gas\nat high z is accumulating as an atomic gas reservoir. This provides additional\nfuel for star formation in 10^10 - 10^12 Msun halos at z ~ 1-3, which allows\nthe SFR to exceed the instantaneous IR, and may enable an even higher outflow\nrate. At z<1, following the natural decline in IR with time due to the\nuniversal expansion, the SFR and sSFR are expected to drop.

JCs in the galaxy center heat up their MACHOs by tidal\nforces, which makes them expand, so that coagulation and star formation occurs.\nBeing continuously fed by matter from bypassing JCs, the central star(s) may\ntransform into a super massive black hole. It has a fast $t^3$ growth during\nthe first mega years, and a slow $t^{1/3}$ growth at giga years. JCs disrupted\nby a close encounter with this black hole can provide matter for the bulge.\nThose that survive can be so agitated that they form stars inside them and\nbecome globular star clusters.

Noguchi (1998,1999) suggested another\nbulge formation scenario, `clump-origin bulge'. He demonstrated using a\nnumerical simulation that a galactic disc suffers dynamical instability to form\nclumpy structures in the early stage of disc formation since the premature disc\nis expected to be highly gas-rich, then the clumps are sucked into the galactic\ncentre by dynamical friction and merge into a single bulge at the centre. This\nbulge formation scenario, which is expected to happen only at the\nhigh-redshift, is different from the galactic merger and the secular evolution.\nTherefore, clump-origin bulges may have their own unique properties.

To large extent, cooling is\noffset by heating due to active galactic nuclei (AGN) via jets. The cool-core\nclusters, with cooler/denser plasmas, show multiphase gas and signs of some\ncooling in their cores. These observations suggest that the cool core is\nlocally thermally unstable while maintaining global thermal equilibrium. Using\nhigh-resolution, three-dimensional simulations we study the formation of\nmultiphase gas in cluster cores heated by highly-collimated bipolar AGN jets.\nOur key conclusion is that spatially extended multiphase filaments form only\nwhen the instantaneous ratio of the thermal instability and free-fall\ntimescales (t_TI/t_ff) falls below a critical threshold of \\approx 10. When\nthis happens, dense cold gas decouples from the hot ICM phase and generates\ninhomogeneous and spatially extended Halpha filaments. These cold gas clumps\nand filaments `rain' down onto the central regions of the core, forming a cold\nrotating torus and in part feeding the supermassive black hole. Consequently,\nthe self-regulated feedback enhances AGN heating and the core returns to a\nhigher entropy level with t_TI/t_ff > 10. Eventually the core reaches\nquasi-stable global thermal equilibrium, and cold filaments condense out of the\nhot ICM whenever t_TI/t_ff \\lesssim 10. This occurs despite the fact that the\nenergy from AGN jets is supplied to the core in a highly anisotropic fashion.\nThe effective spatial redistribution of heat is enabled in part by the\nturbulent motions in the wake of freely-falling cold filaments.

In this paper, a\nconnection between the gamma-ray and optical variability of 3C345 and\nproperties of its parsec-scale radio emission is investigated. Methods: The\nFermi-LAT data of 3C345, covering an energy range of 0.1-300 GeV, were combined\nwith 32 Very Long Baseline Array observations of the object made at 43.2 GHz in\nthe period of January 2008 - March 2010. Results: The VLBA data reveal\nmorphology and kinematics of the flow on scales of up to ~5 milliarcseconds\n(mas; deprojected linear distances of 380 parsecs). The brightness temperature,\nT_b(r), measured along the jet first decreases with distance proportional to\nr^-(0.95 +/-0.69) and later exhibits a break at ~0.3 mas, with T_b(r)\nproportional to r^-(4.11 +/-0.85) at larger separations. Variations of the\ngamma-ray, optical and parsec-scale radio emission show a similar long-term\ntrend persistent during the entire VLBA monitoring period. The gamma-ray and\noptical variations on shorter time scales are related to structural changes in\nthe jet on scales of ~0.3 mas (~23 parsecs, deprojected), with the gamma-ray\nand optical flares possibly related to the evolution of four distinct\nsuperluminal components identified in the flow. Conclusions: The observations\nindicate that both the quiescent and flaring components of the gamma-ray\nemission are produced in a region of the jet of ~23 pc in extent. This region\nmay mark the Compton-loss dominated zone of the flow and its large extent may\nfavor the synchrotron self-Compton mechanism for gamma-ray production in the\nrelativistic jet of the quasar 3C345. \n\n"}

For this purpose, we use a suite of large cosmological, hydrodynamical\nsimulations from the OverWhelmingly Large Simulations project. The properties\nof cold- and hot-mode gas, which we separate depending on whether the\ntemperature has been higher than 10^5.5 K while it was extragalactic, are\nclearly distinguishable in the outer parts of massive haloes (virial\ntemperatures >> 10^5 K. The differences between cold- and hot-mode gas resemble\nthose between inflowing and outflowing gas. The cold-mode gas is mostly\nconfined to clumpy filaments that are approximately in pressure equilibrium\nwith the diffuse, hot-mode gas. Besides being colder and denser, cold-mode gas\ntypically has a much lower metallicity and is much more likely to be infalling.\nHowever, the spread in the properties of the gas is large, even for a given\nmode and a fixed radius and halo mass, which makes it impossible to make strong\nstatements about individual gas clouds. Metal-line cooling causes a strong\ncooling flow near the central galaxy, which makes it hard to distinguish gas\naccreted through the cold and hot modes in the inner halo. Stronger feedback\nresults in larger outflow velocities and pushes hot-mode gas to larger radii.\nThe gas properties evolve as expected from virial arguments, which can also\naccount for the dependence of many gas properties on halo mass. We argue that\ncold streams penetrating hot haloes are observable as high-column density HI\nLyman-alpha absorption systems in sightlines near massive foreground galaxies. \n\n"}

We\ncombine the population synthesis code Starburst99 with a semi-analytical model\nof galactic outflows and a model for the distribution and abundances of\nchemical elements inside the outflows. Starting with a galaxy mass, formation\nredshift, and adopting a particular form for the star formation rate, we\ndescribe the evolution of the stellar populations in the galaxy, the evolution\nof the metallicity and chemical composition of the interstellar medium (ISM),\nthe propagation of the galactic wind, and the metal-enrichment of the\nintergalactic medium (IGM). In this paper, we study the properties of the\nmodel, by varying the mass of the galaxy, the star formation rate, and the\nefficiency of star formation. Our main results are the following: (1) For a\ngiven star formation efficiency f*, a more extended period of active star\nformation tends to produce a galactic wind that reaches a larger extent. If f*\nis sufficiently large, the energy deposited by the stars completely expels the\nISM. Eventually, the ISM is being replenished by mass loss from supernovae and\nstellar winds. (2) For galaxies with masses above 10^11 Msun, the material\nejected in the IGM always falls back onto the galaxy. Hence lower-mass galaxies\nare the ones responsible for enriching the IGM. (3) Stellar winds play a minor\nrole in the dynamical evolution of the galactic wind, because their energy\ninput is small compared to supernovae. However, they contribute significantly\nto the chemical composition of the galactic wind. We conclude that the history\nof the ISM enrichment plays a determinant role in the chemical composition and\nextent of the galactic wind, and therefore its ability to enrich the IGM. \n\n"}

We\nestimate the spectral index, the polarization angle, the polarization fraction\nand apparent size and shape of these objects when smoothed to a nominal\nresolution of 1 degree FWHM. Second, we compute the spectral index as a\nfunction of polarization orientation, alpha. Because these objects are\napproximately point sources with constant polarization angle, this function\nshould be constant in the absence of systematics. However, computing it for the\nK- and Ka-band WMAP data we find strong index variations for all four sources.\nFor Tau A, we find a spectral index beta=-2.59+-0.03 for alpha=30 degrees, and\nbeta=-2.03+-0.01 for alpha=50 degrees.

We start from the collisionless Boltzmann equation\nand assume that interaction between the clumps and the ADAF is responsible for\ntransporting angular momentum of clumps outward. The inner edge of the\nclumpy-ADAF is set to be the tidal radius of the clumps. We consider strong and\nweak coupling cases, in which the averaged properties of clumps follow the ADAF\ndynamics and mainly determined by the black hole potential, respectively. We\nget the analytical solution of the dynamics of clumps for the two cases. The\nvelocity dispersion of clumps is one magnitude higher than the ADAF for the\nstrong coupling case. For the weak coupling case, we find that the mean radial\nvelocity of clumps is linearly proportional to the coefficient of the drag\nforce.

Using the\nassociation of long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) with the death of massive stars\nand their ultra-luminous nature, the CSFH can be probed to higher redshifts\nthan current conventional methods. Unfortunately, no consensus has been reached\non the manner in which the LGRB rate (LGRBR) traces the CSFH, leaving many of\nthe questions mentioned mostly unexplored by this method. Observations by the\nGRB NIR detector (GROND) over the past 4 years have, for the first time,\nacquired highly complete LGRB samples. Driven by these completeness levels and\nnew evidence of LGRBs also occurring in more massive and metal rich galaxies\nthan previously thought, the possible biases of the LGRBR-CSFH connection are\ninvestigated over a large range of galaxy properties. The CSFH is modelled\nusing empirical fits to the galaxy mass function and galaxy star formation\nrates. Biasing the CSFH by metallicity cuts, mass range boundaries, and other\nunknown redshift dependencies, a LGRBR is generated and compared to the highly\ncomplete GROND sample. It is found that there is no strong preference for a\nmetallicity cut or fixed galaxy mass boundaries and that there are no unknown\nredshift effects, in contrast to previous work which suggest values of\nZ/Z_sun~0.1-0.3. From the best-fit models, we predict that ~1.2% of the LGRB\nburst sample exists above z=6.

The former result from\nthe direct collapse of gas in T_s^h >1.5x10^4K, H_2-free halos; the latter are\nthe endproduct of a standard H_2-based star formation process. The H_2-free\ncondition is attained by exposing halos to a strong (J_21 > 10^3) Lyman-Werner\nUV background produced by both accreting BHs and stars, thus establishing a\nself-regulated growth regime. We find that this condition is met already at z\nclose to 18 in the highly biased regions in which quasars are born. The key\nparameter allowing the formation of SMBHs by z=6-7 is the fraction of halos\nthat can form heavy seeds: the minimum requirement is that f_heavy>0.001; SMBH\nas large as 2x10^10 Msol can be obtained when f_heavy approaches unity.\nIndependently of f_heavy, the model produces a high-z stellar bulge-black hole\nmass relation which is steeper than the local one, implying that SMBHs formed\nbefore their bulge was in place. The formation of heavy seeds, allowed by the\nLyman-Werner radiative feedback in the quasar-forming environment, is crucial\nto achieve a fast growth of the SMBH by merger events in the early phases of\nits evolution, i.e. z>7.

We focus\non the possibility that the coupling between the in-streaming gas and the disc\nis maximal, e.g., via dense clumps, and ask whether the streams could be the\ndriver of turbulence in an unstable disc with a Toomre parameter Q~1. Our\nfiducial model assumes an efficiency of ~0.5 per dynamical time for the decay\nof turbulence energy, and ~0.02 for each of the processes that deplete the disc\ngas, i.e., star formation, outflow, and inflow within the disc into a central\nbulge. In this case, the in-streaming drives a ratio of turbulent to rotation\nvelocity sigma/V~0.2-0.3, which at z~2 induces an instability with Q~1, both as\nobserved. However, in conflict with observations, this model predicts that\nsigma/V remains constant with time, independent of the cosmological accretion\nrate, because mass and turbulence have the same external source. Such strongly\ncoupled cosmological inflow tends to stabilize the disc at low z, with Q ~ a\nfew, which may be consistent with observations. The instability could instead\nbe maintained for longer, with a properly declining sigma/V, if it is\nself-regulated to oscillations about Q~1 by a duty cycle for disc depletion.\nHowever, the 'off' phases of this duty cycle become long at low z, which may be\nhard to reconcile with observations. Alternatively, the coupling between the\nin-streaming gas and the disc may weaken in time, reflecting an evolving nature\nof the accretion. If, instead, that coupling is weak at all times, the likely\nenergy source for self-regulated stirring up of the turbulence is the inflow\nwithin the disc down the potential gradient (studied in a companion paper). \n\n"}

A\nyoung supernova remnant is inserted in the first star's relic HII region in the\nfree expansion phase and is followed for 40 Myr employing adaptive mesh\nrefinement and Lagrangian tracer particle techniques. The supernova remnant\nremains partially trapped within the minihalo and the thin snowplow shell\ndevelops pronounced instability and fingering.

Homogeneous and inhomogeneous unpinning\ngeometries, representing creep- and avalanche-like glitches, provide lower and\nupper bounds on the gravitational wave signal strength respectively.

The signal is also computed as a function of vortex travel\ndistance and stellar angular velocity. Convenient amplitude scalings are\nderived as functions of these parameters. For the typical astrophysical\nsituation, where the glitch duration (in units of the spin period) is large\ncompared to the vortex travel distance (in units of the stellar radius), an\nindividual glitch from an object $1\\,\\rm{kpc}$ from Earth generates a wave\nstrain of $10^{-24} [(\\Delta\\omega/\\omega) / 10^{-7}] (\\omega/10^2 \\rm{rad\ns}^{-1})^3 (\\Delta r / 10^{-2} \\rm{m})^{-1}$, where $\\Delta r$ is the average\ndistance travelled by a vortex during a glitch, $\\Delta\\omega/\\omega$ is the\nfractional glitch size, and $\\omega$ is the pulsar angular velocity.

Constrained by the\nobservation of the rotational stars moving in circular orbits with nearly\nconstant tangential speed in a spiral galaxy, the background of the phantom\nfield which is spatially inhomogeneous has an exponential potential. To avoid\nthe well-known quantum instability of the vacuum at high frequencies, the\nphantom field defined in an effective theory is valid only at low energies.\nUnder this assumption, we further investigate the following properties. The\nabsorption cross section of the low-energy $S$-wave excitations of the phantom\nfield into the central black hole is shown to be the horizontal area of the\ncentral black hole. Because the infalling phantom particles have a total\nnegative energy, the accretion of the phantom energy is related to the decrease\nof the black hole mass which is estimated to be much less than a solar mass in\nthe lifetime of the Universe.

{"id": "1205.0253", "contents": "Title: The Radius of Baryonic Collapse in Disc Galaxy Formation Abstract: In the standard picture of disc galaxy formation, baryons and dark matter\nreceive the same tidal torques, and therefore approximately the same initial\nspecific angular momentum. However, observations indicate that disc galaxies\ntypically have only about half as much specific angular momentum as their dark\nmatter haloes. We argue this does not necessarily imply that baryons lose this\nmuch specific angular momentum as they form galaxies. It may instead indicate\nthat galaxies are most directly related to the inner regions of their host\nhaloes, as may be expected in a scenario where baryons in the inner parts of\nhaloes collapse first. A limiting case is examined under the idealised\nassumption of perfect angular momentum conservation. Namely, we determine the\ndensity contrast Delta, with respect to the critical density of the Universe,\nby which dark matter haloes need to be defined in order to have the same\naverage specific angular momentum as the galaxies they host. Under the\nassumption that galaxies are related to haloes via their characteristic\nrotation velocities, the necessary Delta is ~600. This Delta corresponds to an\naverage halo radius and mass which are ~60% and ~75%, respectively, of the\nvirial values (i.e., for Delta = 200). We refer to this radius as the radius of\nbaryonic collapse R_BC, since if specific angular momentum is conserved\nperfectly, baryons would come from within it. It is not likely a simple step\nfunction due to the complex gastrophysics involved, therefore we regard it as\nan effective radius. In summary, the difference between the predicted initial\nand the observed final specific angular momentum of galaxies, which is\nconventionally attributed solely to angular momentum loss, can more naturally\nbe explained by a preference for collapse of baryons within R_BC, with possibly\nsome later angular momentum transfer. \n\n"}

Mass function types\nreflect the older stars and therefore the stellar mass distribution, while SFR\nfunction types arise from the young stars and hence the distribution of SFRs.\nOptical and near-infrared LFs are of the mass function type, and are well fit\nby a Schechter function (power law with an exponential cutoff at the bright\nend). In contrast, LFs of the SFR function type are of a different form, one\nthat cannot be adequately described by a Schechter function. We demonstrate\nthis difference by generating SFR distributions for mock samples of galaxies\ndrawn from a Schechter stellar mass distribution along with established\nempirical relations between the SFR and stellar mass. Compared with the\nSchechter function, SFR distributions have a shallower decline at the bright\nend, which can be traced to the large intrinsic scatter of SFRs at any given\nstellar mass. A superior description of SFR distributions is given by the\n\"Saunders\" function, which combines a power law with a Gaussian at the high\nend. We show that the Schechter-like appearance of UV and H alpha LFs, although\nthey are LFs of SFR function type, results when luminosities are not corrected\nfor dust, or when average statistical corrections are used because individual\nattenuation measurements are not available. We thus infer that the\nnon-Schechter form of the far-IR LFs is a true reflection of the underlying SFR\ndistribution, rather than the purported artifact of AGN contamination. \n\n"}

In these\n\\eta-parametrised asymmetric dark matter models (\\eta-ADM), the dark matter\nparticles have an annihilation cross section close to the weak interaction\ncross section, and a value of \\eta-dark matter asymmetry close to the baryon\nasymmetry \\eta_B.

The EBL affects the spectrum of the sources,\npredominantly blazars, in the ~10 GeV to 10 TeV energy regime.

Broad band spectral analysis Abstract: (Abridged) The simultaneous UV to X-rays/gamma rays data obtained during the\nmulti-wavelength XMM/INTEGRAL campaign on the Seyfert 1 Mrk 509 are used in\nthis paper and tested against physically motivated broad band models. Each\nobservation has been fitted with a realistic thermal comptonisation model for\nthe continuum emission. Prompted by the correlation between the UV and soft\nX-ray flux, we use a thermal comptonisation component for the soft X-ray\nexcess. The UV to X-rays/gamma-rays emission of Mrk 509 can be well fitted by\nthese components. The presence of a relatively hard high-energy spectrum points\nto the existence of a hot (kT~100 keV), optically-thin (tau~0.5) corona\nproducing the primary continuum. On the contrary, the soft X-ray component\nrequires a warm (kT~1 keV), optically-thick (tau~15) plasma. Estimates of the\namplification ratio for this warm plasma support a configuration close to the\n\"theoretical\" configuration of a slab corona above a passive disk. An\ninteresting consequence is the weak luminosity-dependence of its emission, a\npossible explanation of the roughly constant spectral shape of the soft X-ray\nexcess seen in AGNs. The temperature (~ 3 eV) and flux of the soft-photon field\nentering and cooling the warm plasma suggests that it covers the accretion disk\ndown to a transition radius $R_{tr}$ of 10-20 $R_g$. This plasma could be the\nwarm upper layer of the accretion disk. On the contrary the hot corona has a\nmore photon-starved geometry.

Parametric resonance might be expected to cause a fast\ndecay of the curvaton, so that it would not have time to build up the curvature\nperturbation. However, we show that this is not the case, and that the resonant\ndecay of the curvaton may be delayed even down to electroweak symmetry\nbreaking. This delay is due to the coupling of the higgs to the thermal\nbackground, which is formed by the Standard Model degrees of freedom created\nfrom the inflaton decay. We establish the occurrence of the delay by\nconsidering the curvaton evolution and the structure of the higgs resonances.\nWe then provide analytical expressions for the delay time, and for the\nsubsequent resonant production of the higgs, which ultimately leads to the\ncurvaton effective decay width. Contrary to expectations, it is possible to\nobtain the observed curvature perturbation for values of the curvaton-higgs\ncoupling as large as 0.1.

We assume that the\nmagnetic field generation can be described as an injection of magnetic energy\nto cosmological plasma at a given scale determined by the moment of magnetic\nfield generation. A high Reynolds number ensures strong coupling between\nmagnetic field and fluid motions. The subsequent evolution of the magnetic\nfield is governed by decaying hydromagnetic turbulence. Both our numerical\nsimulations and a phenomenological description allow us to recover \"universal\"\nlaws for the decay of magnetic energy and the growth of magnetic correlation\nlength in the turbulent (low viscosity) regime. In particular, we show that\nduring the radiation dominated epoch, energy and correlation length of\nnon-helical magnetic fields scale as conformal time to the powers -1/2 and\n+1/2, respectively. For helical magnetic fields, energy and correlation length\nscale as conformal time to the powers -1/3 and +2/3, respectively.

Both the mid-infrared (MIR)\nattenuation and continuum luminosity are expected to be related to dust\nassociated with the torus. Therefore, isolating the nuclear component is\nessential to study the MIR emission of AGN. We have compiled all the T-ReCS\nspectra (Gemini observatory) available in the N-band for 22 AGN: 5 Type-1 and\n17 Type-2 AGN. The high angular resolution of the T-ReCs spectra allows us to\nprobe physical regions of 57 pc (median). We have used a novel pipeline called\nRedCan capable of producing flux- and wavelength-calibrated spectra for the\nCanariCam (GTC) and T-ReCS (Gemini) instruments. We have measured the\nfine-structure [SIV] at 10.5 microns and the PAH at 11.3 microns line strengths\ntogether with the silicate absorption/emission features. We have also compiled\nSpitzer/IRS spectra to understand how spatial resolution influences the\nresults. The 11.3 microns PAH feature is only clearly detected in the nuclear\nspectra of two AGN, while it is more common in the Spitzer data. For those two\nobjects the AGN emission in NGC7130 accounts for more than 80% of the MIR\ncontinuum at 12 microns while in the case of NGC1808 the AGN is not dominating\nthe MIR emission.

If\ninstead the haze is due to an astrophysical mechanism peculiar to the Milky Way\nor to a transient event, a similar halo need not exist around all Milky Way\n\"twins\". We use radio observations of 66 spiral galaxies to test the dark\nmatter origin of the haze. We select galaxies based on morphological type and\nmaximal rotational velocity, and obtain their luminosities from a 1.49 GHz\ncatalog and additional radio observations at other frequencies. We find many\ninstances of galaxies with radio emission that is less than 5% as bright as\nnaively expected from dark matter models that could produce the Milky Way haze,\nand at least 3 galaxies that are less than 1% as bright as expected, assuming\ndark matter distributions, magnetic fields, and cosmic ray propagation\nparameters equal to those of the Milky Way.

To explain the growth of the\nmagnetic field strength over many orders of magnitude fast amplification\nprocesses need to operate. The most efficient mechanism known today is the\nsmall-scale dynamo, which converts turbulent kinetic energy into magnetic\nenergy leading to an exponential growth of the magnetic field. The efficiency\nof the dynamo depends on the type of turbulence indicated by the slope of the\nturbulence spectrum v(l) \\propto l^{theta}, where v(l) is the eddy velocity at\na scale l. We explore turbulent spectra ranging from incompressible Kolmogorov\nturbulence with theta = 1/3 to highly compressible Burgers turbulence with\ntheta = 1/2. In this work we analyze the properties of the small-scale dynamo\nfor low magnetic Prandtl numbers Pm, which denotes the ratio of the magnetic\nReynolds number, Rm, to the hydrodynamical one, Re. We solve the Kazantsev\nequation, which describes the evolution of the small-scale magnetic field,\nusing the WKB approximation. In the limit of low magnetic Prandtl numbers the\ngrowth rate is proportional to Rm^{(1-theta)/(1+theta)}. We furthermore discuss\nthe critical magnetic Reynolds number Rm_crit, which is required for\nsmall-scale dynamo action. The value of Rm_crit is roughly 100 for Kolmogorov\nturbulence and 2700 for Burgers. Furthermore, we discuss that Rm_crit provides\na stronger constraint in the limit of low Pm than it does for large Pm. We\nconclude that the small-scale dynamo can operate in the regime of low magnetic\nPrandtl numbers, if the magnetic Reynolds number is large enough.

Here we use cosmological zoom simulations of galaxy formation down to z\n= 2 to show that such strong self-regulation is required in the popular\nspherical Bondi accretion model, but that a plausible alternative model in\nwhich black hole growth is limited by galaxy-scale torques does not require\nself-regulation. Instead, this torque-limited accretion model yields black\nholes and galaxies evolving on average along the observed scaling relations by\nrelying only on a fixed, 5% mass retention rate onto the black hole from the\nradius at which the accretion flow is fed. Feedback from the black hole may\n(and likely does) occur, but does not need to couple to galaxy-scale gas in\norder to regulate black hole growth. We show that this result is insensitive to\nvariations in the initial black hole mass, stellar feedback, or other\nimplementation details. The torque-limited model allows for high accretion\nrates at very early epochs (unlike the Bondi case), which if viable can help\nexplain the rapid early growth of black holes, while by z = 2 it yields\nEddington factors of 1%-10%. This model also yields a less direct\ncorrespondence between major merger events and rapid phases of black hole\ngrowth.

We report new optical and near-IR\nphotometry and spectroscopy obtained during the fading event. The system\nappears much redder and fainter than it was in the bright state. Also, the 8.2d\nphotometric period continuously observed for more than 20 years is not seen\nduring most of the deep state. The analysis of the system's brightness and\ncolors suggests that the visual extinction on the line of sight has increased\nby about 3-4 magnitudes in the deep state. At optical wavelengths, the system\nappears to be dominated by scattered light, probably originating from the upper\nsurface layers of a highly inclined circumstellar disk.

Abstract: Luminous high-redshift QSOs are thought to exist within the most massive dark\nmatter haloes in the young Universe. As a consequence they are likely to be\nmarkers for biased, over-dense regions where early galaxies cluster, regions\nthat eventually grow into the groups and clusters seen in the lower redshift\nuniverse. In this paper we explore the clustering of galaxies around z ~ 5 QSOs\nas traced by Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs). We target the fields of three QSOs\nusing the same optical imaging and spectroscopy techniques used in the ESO\nRemote Galaxy Survey (ERGS, Douglas et al. 2009, 2010), which was successful in\nidentifying individual clustered structures of LBGs. We use the statistics of\nthe redshift clustering in ERGS to show that two of the three fields show\nsignificant clustering of LBGs at the QSO redshifts. Neither of these fields is\nobviously over-dense in LBGs from the imaging alone; a possible reason why\nprevious imaging-only studies of high-redshift QSO environments have given\nambiguous results. This result shows that luminous QSOs at z ~ 5 are typically\nfound in over-dense regions. The richest QSO field contains at least nine\nspectroscopically confirmed objects at the same redshift including the QSO\nitself, seven LBGs and a second fainter QSO. While this is a very strong\nobservational signal of clustering at z ~ 5, it is of similar strength to that\nseen in two structures identified in the 'blank sky' ERGS fields. This\nindicates that, while over-dense, the QSO environments are not more extreme\nthan other structures that can be identified at these redshifts. The three\nrichest structures discovered in this work and in ERGS have properties\nconsistent with that expected for proto-clusters and likely represent the early\nstages in the build-up of massive current-day groups and clusters. \n\n"}

Previous studies have focused on if and how AGN feedback\nheats the gas, but little paid attention to its triggering mechanism. Using\nspherically symmetric simulations, we investigate how large-scale cooling flows\nare accreted by central supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in eight well-observed\nsystems and find an interesting dichotomy. In massive clusters, the gas\ndevelops a central cooling catastrophe within about the cooling time (typically\n~ 100 - 300 Myr), resulting in a cold-mode accretion onto SMBHs. However, in\nour four simulated systems on group and galaxy scales at a low metallicity\nZ=0.3Z_{sun}, the gas quickly settles into a long-term state which has a cuspy\ncentral temperature profile extending to several tens to about 100 pc.

We present new CO observations and/or Spitzer\nmid-IR spectroscopy for 6 70 micron selected galaxies at z~1 in order to\nquantify the properties of the molecular gas reservoir, the contribution of an\nactive galactic nuclei (AGN) to the mid-IR luminosity and the star formation\nefficiency (SFE=LIR/L'CO). The mid-IR spectra show strong polycyclic aromatic\nhydrocarbon (PAH) emission and our spectral decomposition suggests that the AGN\nmakes a minimal contribution (<25%) to the mid-IR luminosity. The 70 micron\nselected ULIRGs which we find to be spectroscopic close pairs, are observed to\nhave high SFE, similar to local ULIRGs and high redshift submillimeter\ngalaxies, consistent with enhanced IR luminosity due to an ongoing major\nmerger. Combined with existing observations of local and high redshift ULIRGs,\nwe further compare the PAH, IR and CO luminosities. We show that the ratio\nLPAH6.2/LIR decreases with increasing IR luminosity for both local and high\nredshift galaxies but the trend for high redshift galaxies is shifted to higher\nIR luminosities; the average LPAH6.2/LIR ratio at a given LIR is ~3 times\nhigher at high redshift. When we normalize by the molecular gas, we find this\ntrend to be uniform for galaxies at all redshifts and that the molecular gas is\ncorrelated with the PAH dust emission.The similar trends seen in the [CII] to\nmolecular gas ratios in other studies suggests that PAH emission, like [CII],\ncontinues to be a good tracer of photodissociation regions even at high\nredshift.

Our simulations include fully explicit treatment of both the\nmulti-phase ISM (molecular through hot) and stellar feedback. The stellar\nfeedback inputs (energy, momentum, mass, and metal fluxes) are taken directly\nfrom stellar population models. These sources of stellar feedback, with zero\nadjusted parameters, reproduce the observed relation between stellar and halo\nmass up to M_halo~10^12 M_sun (including dwarfs, satellites, MW-mass disks, and\nsmall groups). By extension, this leads to reasonable agreement with the\nstellar mass function for M_star<10^11 M_sun. We predict weak redshift\nevolution in the M_star-M_halo relation, consistent with current constraints to\nz>6. We find that the M_star-M_halo relation is insensitive to numerical\ndetails, but is sensitive to the feedback physics. Simulations with only\nsupernova feedback fail to reproduce the observed stellar masses, particularly\nin dwarf and high-redshift galaxies: radiative feedback (photo-heating and\nradiation pressure) is necessary to disrupt GMCs and enable efficient coupling\nof later supernovae to the gas.

These observations provide the first\nhigh-quality spectra of Holmberg IX X-1 above 10 keV to date, extending the\nX-ray coverage of this remarkable source up to ~30 keV. Broadband observations\nwere undertaken at two epochs, between which Holmberg IX X-1 exhibited both\nflux and strong spectral variability, increasing in luminosity from Lx =\n(1.90+/-0.03)e40 erg/s to Lx = (3.35+/-0.03)e40 erg/s. Neither epoch exhibits a\nspectrum consistent with emission from the standard low/hard accretion state\nseen in Galactic black hole binaries, that would have been expected if Holmberg\nIX X-1 harbors a truly massive black hole accreting at substantially\nsub-Eddington accretion rates. The NuSTAR data confirm that the curvature\nobserved previously in the 3-10 keV bandpass does represent a true spectral\ncutoff. During each epoch, the spectrum appears to be dominated by two\noptically thick thermal components, likely associated with an accretion disk.\nThe spectrum also shows some evidence for a non-thermal tail at the highest\nenergies, which may further support this scenario.

Using high-resolution\nobservations of plage magnetic fields made with the Solar Optical Telescope\naboard the Hinode satellite, we investigate this idea by estimating the upward\ntransport of magnetic energy --- the vertical Poynting flux, S_z --- across the\nphotosphere in a plage region.

Plage fields are ideal observational targets for\nestimating energy injection by convection, because they are: (i) strong enough\nto be measured with relatively small uncertainties; (ii) not so strong that\nconvection is heavily suppressed (as within umbrae); and (iii) unipolar, so S_z\nin plage is not influenced by mixed-polarity processes (e.g., flux emergence)\nunrelated to heating in stable, active-region fields. In this plage region, we\nfound that the average S_z varied in space, but was positive (upward) and\nsufficient to explain coronal heating, with values near (5 +/- 1) x 10^7\nerg/cm^2/s.

It is shown that, in EE, a positive dark energy density requires a\nLagrangian leading to quantum ghosts, whereas VT is free from these ghosts. On\naccount of this fact, the remainder of the paper is devoted to study cosmology\nin the framework of VT. Initial conditions, at high redshift, are used to solve\nthe evolution equations of all the VT scalar modes. In particular, a certain\nscalar mode characteristic of VT -which does not appear in general relativity\n(GR)- is chosen in such a way that it evolves separately. In other words, the\nscalar modes of the standard model based on GR do not affect the evolution of\nthe VT characteristic mode; however, this scalar mode influences the evolution\nof the standard GR ones. Some well known suitable codes (CMBFAST and COSMOMC)\nhave been modified to include our VT initial conditions and evolution\nequations, which are fully general.

We show that this effect can be used to effectively disentangle the\nintrinsic variability of those two regions, offering the opportunity to perform\nreverberation mapping based on single band photometric data. Based on simulated\nlight curves generated using a damped random walk model of quasar variability,\nwe show that measurement of the size of the broad line region can be achieved\nusing this method, provided one spectrum has been obtained independently during\nthe monitoring. This method is complementary to photometric reverberation\nmapping and could also be extended to multi-band data. Because the effect\ndescribed above produces a variability pattern in difference light curves\nbetween pairs of lensed images which is correlated with the time-lagged\ncontinuum variability, it can potentially produce systematic errors in\nmeasurement of time delays between pairs of lensed images. Simple simulations\nindicate that time-delay measurement techniques which use a sufficiently\nflexible model for the extrinsic variability are not affected by this effect\nand produce accurate time delays. \n\n"}

I: Stellar mass at z<1 Abstract: LGRBs are associated with massive stars and are therefore linked to star\nformation. The conditions necessary to produce LGRBs can affect the relation\nbetween the LGRB rate and star formation. By using the power of a complete LGRB\nsample, our aim is to understand whether such a bias exists and, if it does,\nwhat is its origin. In this first paper, we build the SED of the z<1 host\ngalaxies of the BAT6 LGRB sample, and determine their stellar masses from SED\nfitting. We compare the resulting stellar mass distribution (i) with\nstar-forming galaxies observed in deep surveys (UltraVISTA); (ii) with\nsemi-analitical models of the z<1 star forming galaxy population and (iii) with\nnumerical simulations of LGRB hosts having different metallicity thresholds for\nthe progenitor star environment. We find that at z<1 LGRBs tend to avoid\nmassive galaxies and are powerful in selecting faint low-mass star-forming\ngalaxies. The stellar mass distribution of the hosts is not consistent with\nthat of the UltraVISTA star-forming galaxies weighted for their SFR. This\nimplies that, at least at z<1, LGRBs are not unbiased tracers of star\nformation. To make the two distributions consistent, a much steeper faint-end\nof the mass function would be required, or a very shallow SFR-Mass relation for\nthe low mass galaxy population. GRB host galaxy simulations indicates that, to\nreproduce the stellar mass distribution, a metallicity threshold of the order\nof Z_th=0.3-0.5Z_sun is necessary. Models without a metallicity threshold or\nwith an extreme threshold of Z_th = 0.1Z_sun are excluded at z<1. The use of\nthe BAT6 complete sample makes this result not affected by possible biases\nwhich could have influenced past results based on incomplete samples. The\npreference for low metallicities (Z<~0.5Z_sun) can be a consequence of the\nparticular conditions needed for the progenitor star to produce a GRB.\n(Abridged) \n\n"}

The density of axions in\nthe universe, which cannot exceed the relic dark matter density and is a\nquantity of great interest in axion experiments like ADMX, is a result of the\nearly-universe interplay between cosmological evolution and the axion mass as a\nfunction of temperature. The latter quantity is proportional to the second\nderivative of the QCD free energy with respect to the CP-violating phase,\n$\\theta$. However, this quantity is generically non-perturbative and previous\ncalculations have only employed instanton models at the high temperatures of\ninterest (roughly 1 GeV).

Due to the higher event rate of GRBs at higher redshifts,\nit has been speculated that life as we know it may not survive above a certain\nredshift (e.g. $z>0.5$). We examine the duty cycle of lethal (life-threatening)\nGRBs in the solar neighborhood, in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) galaxies\nand GRB host galaxies, with the dependence of the long GRB rate on star\nformation and metallicity properly taken into account. We find that the number\nof lethal GRBs attacking Earth within the past 500 Myr ($\\sim$ epoch of the\nOrdovician mass extinction) is $0.93$. The number of lethal GRBs hitting a\ncertain planet increases with redshift, thanks to the increasing star formation\nrate and decreasing metallicity in high-$z$ galaxies. Taking 1 per 500 Myr as a\nconservative duty cycle for life to survive, as evidenced by our existence, we\nfind that there are still a good fraction of SDSS galaxies beyond $z=0.5$ where\nthe GRB rate at half-mass radius is lower than this value.

With this optimal baseline\ndesign, we investigate three observing strategies, analysing the trade-off\nbetween lowering the instrumental thermal noise against increasing the field of\nview. SKA1-low intends to perform a three tiered observing approach, including\na deep 100 deg$^{2}$ at 1000 h, a medium-deep 1000 deg$^{2}$ at 100 h and a\nshallow 10,000 deg$^{2}$ at 10 h survey.

This is contrary to naive predictions based purely on\nthe total signal-to-noise, thus highlighting the need to use EoR parameter\nconstraints as a figure of merit, in order to maximise scientific returns with\nnext generation interferometers. \n\n"}

Several approaches to reducing shape noise have recently\nbeen put forward, using information beyond photometry, such as radio\npolarization and optical spectroscopy. Here we investigate how well the\nintrinsic ellipticities of galaxies can be predicted using other, exclusively\nphotometric parameters. These parameters (such as galaxy colours) are already\navailable in the data and do not necessitate additional, often expensive\nobservations. We apply two regression techniques, generalized additive models\n(GAM) and projection pursuit regression (PPR) to the publicly released data\ncatalog of galaxy properties from CFHTLenS.

This means that without additional observations beyond photometry\nthe ellipticity contribution to the shear can be measured to higher precision,\ncomparable to using a larger sample of galaxies.

However, conversely to the minimal case,\nin Horndeski theories, the super-horizon Newtonian potential can potentially\ngrow to very large values after inflation exit. If that happens, inflationary\npredictability is lost during the oscillating period. When this does not\nhappen, the perturbations generated during inflation can be standardly related\nto the CMB, if the theory chosen is minimal at low energies. As a concrete\nexample, we analytically and numerically discuss the new Higgs inflationary\ncase. There, the Inflaton is the Higgs boson that is non-minimally kinetically\ncoupled to gravity. During the high-energy part of the post-inflationary\noscillations, the system is anisotropic and the Newtonian potential is largely\namplified. Thanks to the smallness of today's amplitude of curvature\nperturbations, however, the system stays in the linear regime, so that\ninflationary predictions are not lost. At low energies, when the system relaxes\nto the minimal case, the anisotropies disappear and the Newtonian potential\nconverges to a constant value.

Gas particles lying inside a bi-conical\nvolume around the BH are imparted a one-time velocity (10,000 km/s) increment.\nWe perform hydrodynamical simulations of isolated cluster (total mass 10^14 /h\nM_sun), which is initially evolved to form a dense cool core, having central\nT<10^6 K. A BH resides at the cluster center, and ejects energy. The\nfeedback-driven fast wind undergoes shock with the slower-moving gas, which\ncauses the imparted kinetic energy to be thermalized. Bipolar bubble-like\noutflows form propagating radially outward to a distance of a few 100 kpc. The\nradial profiles of median gas properties are influenced by BH feedback in the\ninner regions (r<20-50 kpc). BH kinetic feedback, with a large value of the\nfeedback efficiency, depletes the inner cool gas and reduces the hot gas\ncontent, such that the initial cool core of the cluster is heated up within a\ntime 1.9 Gyr, whereby the core median temperature rises to above 10^7 K, and\nthe central entropy flattens. Our implementation of BH thermal feedback (using\nthe same efficiency as kinetic), within the star-formation model, cannot do\nthis heating, where the cool core remains. The inclusion of cold gas accretion\nin the simulations produces naturally a duty cycle of the AGN with a\nperiodicity of 100 Myr. \n\n"}

Among these sources, Pop III stars are expected to\ninduce the strongest signal with levels strongly dependent on the frequency of\nobservation and on the number, Np, of the Pop III stars per halo.\nOptimistically, a CP signal in the CMB due to the Pop III stars could be at a\nlevel of deltaV/TCMB ~ 2x10^{-7} in scales of 1 degree at 10 GHz, which is much\nsmaller than the currently existing upper limits on the CP measurements.\nPrimary foregrounds in the cosmological CP detection will come from the\ngalactic synchrotron emission (GSE), which is naturally (intrinsically)\ncircularly polarized.

Self-regulation cycle and\n  non-thermal emission Abstract: Self-regulated feedback by active galactic nuclei (AGNs) appears to be\ncritical in balancing radiative cooling of the low-entropy gas at the centres\nof galaxy clusters and in regulating star formation in central galaxies. In a\ncompanion paper, we found steady-state solutions of the hydrodynamic equations\nthat are coupled to the CR energy equation for a large cluster sample.

Here we demonstrate that the\npredicted non-thermal emission resulting from hadronic CR interactions in the\nintra-cluster medium exceeds observational radio (and gamma-ray) data in a\nsubsample of clusters that host radio mini halos (RMHs).

The Br-alpha line\nis predicted to be the brightest among the HI lines under high dust-extinction\nconditions (A_V>15 mag). The Br-alpha line traces ionizing photons from OB\nstars and so is used as an indicator of star formation on the assumption of the\ninitial mass function. We detected the Br-alpha line in 33 ULIRGs. The\nluminosity of the line (L_BrA) correlates well with that of the 3.3 micron PAH\nemission (L_3.3). Thus we utilize L_3.3 as an indicator of star formation in\nfainter objects where the Br-alpha line is undetected. The mean L_BrA/L_IR\nratio in LINERs/Seyferts is significantly lower than that in HII galaxies. This\ndifference is reconfirmed with the L_3.3/L_IR ratio in the larger sample (46\ngalaxies).

Since satellite galaxies tend to reside in massive halos\nwith a greater halo bias, the inclusion boosts the clustering power. In\naddition, virial motions of the satellite galaxies cause a significant\nsuppression of the clustering power due to nonlinear RSD effects. We develop a\nnovel method to recover the redshift-space power spectrum of halos from the\nobserved galaxy distribution by minimizing the contamination of satellite\ngalaxies. The cylinder grouping method (CGM) we study effectively excludes\nsatellite galaxies from a galaxy sample. However, we find that this technique\nproduces apparent anisotropies in the reconstructed halo distribution over all\nthe scales which mimic RSD.

Welcome addition to the MOND lore as it\nis, this approach have reproduced, so far, only a small fraction of MOND\nphenomenology, and is still rather tentative, both in its theoretical\nfoundations and in its phenomenology. What Verlinde has extracted from this\napproach, so far, is a formula -- of rather limited applicability, and with no\nroad to generalization in sight -- for the effective gravitational field of a\nspherical, isolated, static baryonic system. This formula cannot be used to\ncalculate the gravitational field of disk galaxies, with their rich MOND\nphenomenology. Notably, it cannot predict their rotation curves, except\nasymptotically. It does not apply to the few-, or many-body problem; so, it\ncannot give, e.g., the two-body force between two galaxies, or be used to\nconduct N-body calculations of galaxy formation, evolution, and interactions.\nThe formula cannot be applied to the internal dynamics of a system embedded in\nan external field, where MOND predicts important consequences. etc. MOND is\nbacked by full-fledged, Lagrangian theories that can be, and are, routinely\napplied to all the above phenomena, and more.

We find two distinct modes of accretion depending\non the resistivity and field strength. A small resistivity or high field\nstrength promotes the development of rapidly infalling `avalanche accretion\nstreams' in a vertically extended disk envelope that dominates the dynamics of\nthe system, especially the mass accretion. The streams are suppressed in\nsimulations with larger resistivities or lower field strengths, where most of\nthe accretion instead occurs through a laminar disk. In these simulations, the\ndisk accretion is driven mainly by a slow wind that is typically accelerated by\nthe pressure gradient from a predominantly toroidal magnetic field. Both\nwind-dominated and stream-dominated modes of accretion create prominent\nfeatures in the surface density distribution of the disk, including rings and\ngaps, with a strong spatial variation of the magnetic flux relative to the\nmass.

As a result of the momentum conserving nature of these two\nkey components, the new $N$-body scheme is also momentum conserving. Moreover,\nwe can fully utilize the $\\mathcal O(\\textit N)$ complexity of FMM with the\nintegrator. With the restored force symmetry, we can improve both angular\nmomentum conservation and energy conservation substantially. The new scheme\nwill be suitable for many applications in galactic dynamics and structure\nformation. Our implementation, in the code Taichi, is publicly available at\nhttps://bitbucket.org/qirong_zhu/taichi_public/. \n\n"}

This interaction is the result of either a rapid expansion of the\nprimary star due to an instability in its core near the end of its nuclear\nevolution, or due to a dynamical process which rapidly brings the NS into the\nprimary star. The ejecta can reach velocities of 10,000 km/s despite not being\na supernova, and might explain such velocities in the 2011 outburst of the\nluminous blue variable progenitor of SN 2009ip.

However, recent\nliterature has shown possible contamination (up to 2.4% of the stellar mass in\na high redshift sample) of a young component embedded within the predominantly\nold population of the quiescent galaxy.\n  We compared the data with the predictions of each model, using a new approach\nof distinguishing between systematic and statistical errors (in previous works,\nthese had incorrectly been added in quadrature) and evaluating the effects of\ncontamination by a young stellar component.

The dominating\nfactors will be the number of joint detections and the uncertainty on the\nluminosity distance of each event. Neutron star black hole mergers are also\npromising sources for advanced LIGO and Virgo. If the black hole spin induces\nprecession of the orbital plane, the degeneracy between luminosity distance and\nthe orbital inclination is broken, leading to a much better distance\nmeasurement. In addition neutron star black hole sources are observable to\nlarger distances, owing to their higher mass. Neutron star black holes could\nalso emit electromagnetic radiation: depending on the black hole spin and on\nthe mass ratio, the neutron star can be tidally disrupted resulting in\nelectromagnetic emission.

The main parameter of the model is the\nmaximum mass reached by the cloud during its evolution. Thus, specifying the\ninstantaneous mass and some other variable completely determines the cloud's\nevolutionary stage. We apply the model to interpret the observed scatter in\nSFEs of the cloud sample compiled by Lada et al.\\ as an evolutionary effect so\nthat, although clouds such as California and Orion A have similar masses, they\nare in very different evolutionary stages, causing their very different\nobserved SFRs and SFEs.

Current\nmodels predict that a significant amount of magnetic energy should be released\nprior to the merger, leading to electromagnetic precursor emission. In this\npaper, we revisit this problem in the light of the recent progress in kinetic\nmodeling of pulsar magnetospheres. We limit our work to the case of aligned\nmagnetic moments and rotation axes, and thus neglect the orbital motion. We\nperform global two-dimensional axisymmetric particle-in-cell simulations of two\npulsar magnetospheres merging at a rate consistent with the emission of\ngravitational waves. Both symmetric and asymmetric systems are investigated.\nSimulations show a significant enhancement of magnetic dissipation within the\nmagnetospheres as both stars get closer. Even though the magnetospheric\nconfiguration depends on the relative orientations of the pulsar spins and\nmagnetic axes, all configurations present nearly the same radiative signature,\nindicating that a common dissipation mechanism is at work. The relative motion\nof both pulsars drives magnetic reconnection at the boundary between the two\nmagnetospheres, leading to efficient particle acceleration and high-energy\nsynchrotron emission. Polar-cap discharge is also strongly enhanced in\nasymmetric configurations, resulting in vigorous pair production and\npotentially additional high-energy radiation. We observe an increase in the\npulsar radiative efficiency by two orders of magnitude over the last orbit\nbefore the merger exceeding the spindown power of an isolated pulsar. The\nexpected signal is too weak to be detected at high energies even in the nearby\nuniverse. However, if a small fraction of this energy is channeled into radio\nwaves, it could be observed as a non-repeating fast radio burst. \n\n"}

We find that Ly-alpha\nabsorbers are somewhat smaller than in Newtonian gravity with dark matter, but\nthe result depends crucially on the (unknown) background acceleration field in\nwhich they are embedded. In clusters MOND appears to explain the observed\n(baryonic) mass-temperature relation. However, given observed gas density and\nenclosed mass profiles and the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium, MOND\npredicts radial temperature profiles which disagree badly with observations. We\nshow this explicitly for the Virgo, Abell 2199 and Coma clusters, but the\nresults are general, and seem very difficult to avoid. If this discrepancy is\nto be resolved by positing additional (presumably baryonic) dark matter, then\nthis dark matter must have ~1-3 times the cluster gas mass within 1 Mpc. This\nresult strongly disfavors MOND as an alternative to dark matter (Abridged). \n\n"}

The propagation of the cannonballs in the\nGalactic disk and halo is studied. Two mechanisms for the acceleration of the\nobserved CRs are proposed. The first is based on ultrarelativistic shocks in\nthe interstellar medium and could accelerate the bulk of CRs up to the ``knee''\nenergy of 4 x 10(15) eV. The second operates with second-order Fermi\nacceleration within the cannonball. If the total initial energy of the ejected\nplasmoids in a SN explosion is 10(53) ergs or higher this second mechanism may\nexplain the CR spectrum above the knee up to the highest observed energies. It\nis shown that together with plausible assumptions about CR propagation in the\nGalactic confinement volume the observed spectral indices of the CR spectrum\ncan be theoretically understood to first order.

These novel trajectories result in significantly\nreduced background noise from the zodiacal dust radiation and therefore allow a\nreduction in telescope collecting area and hence cost. Two types of optimal\ntrajectories that are energetically feasible were derived using genetic\nalgorithms. These are highly inclined non-Keplerian heliocentric orbits.

We assume that the gas density profile traces\nthe dark matter density profile in outer parts of the haloes, as suggested by\nmany hydrodynamic simulations. Under this assumption, the hydrostatic\nequilibrium uniquely fixes the two free parameters in the model, the\nmass-temperature normalization and the polytropic index, that determine the\ntemperature profile. This enables us to predict a universal gas profile from\nany universal dark matter profile. Our results show that gas tracing dark\nmatter in the outer parts of the haloes is inconsistent with gas being\nisothermal; on the contrary, it requires temperature to decrease slowly with\nradius, in agreement with observations. We compare our predictions for X-ray\nsurface brightness profiles of the haloes and the mass-temperature relation\nwith observations. We find that they are generally in a good agreement. We\ncompare the universal profile with the beta profile and find that, although the\nbeta profile gives a reasonable fit to our predicted profiles, the deviation\nfrom it can explain many of the observed trends, once we take into account the\nobservational selection effects.

The simulations considered mimic three distinct sets of\nphysical conditions. One of them (run \"ISM\") is intended to represent a mixture\nof cool and warm atomic gas, and includes self-gravity and magnetic fields. For\neach simulation, H I spectral-line maps are synthesized and intercompared, both\nwith each other, and with observations, using the SCF. We find that, when\nthermal broadening is large in comparison with fine-scale turbulent velocity\nstructure, it masks sub-thermal velocity sub-structure in the synthesized\nspectra. The H I observations we use here for comparison are of the North\nCelestial Pole (NCP) Loop. None of the simulations match the NCP Loop data very\nwell. The most realistic sets of line profiles and SCF statistics comes from\nartifically rescaling the velocity axis of run ISM. Without rescaling, almost\nall velocity structure is smeared out by thermal broadening. However, if the\nvelocity axis is expanded by a factor of 6, the SCF distributions of run ISM an\nthe NCP Loop match up fairly well. This means that the ratio of thermal to\nturbulent pressure in run ISM is much too large as it stands, and that the\nsimulation is deficient in turbulent energy. This is a consequence of run ISM\nnot including the effects of supernovae. We conclude that the SCF is a useful\ntool for understanding and fine-tuning simulations of interstellar gas, and in\nparticular that realistic simulations of the atomic ISM need to include the\neffects of energetic stellar winds (e.g. supernovae) in order for the ratio of\nthermal-to-turbulent pressure to give spectra representative of the observed\ninterstellar medium in our Galaxy. \n\n"}

A fundamental difference with\nthe lamppost model is that the region of the disc below the flare is not\nilluminated before the onset of the flare.\n  A few test models show that the spectrum which follows immediately the\nincrease in continuum flux should display the characteristics of a highly\nilluminated but dense gas, i.e. very intense X-ray emission lines and\nionization edges in the soft X-ray range. The behaviour of the iron line is\ndifferent in the case of a \"moderate\" and a ``strong'' flare: for a moderate\nflare, the spectrum displays a neutral component of the Fe K$\\alpha$ line at\n6.4 keV, gradually leading to more highly ionized lines.

Moreover, we find\nthat red and early-type galaxies dominate the bright-end of the LF, and that\ntheir number density shows at most a small decrease (<30%) up to z=1, thus\nsuggesting that massive elliptical galaxies were already in place at z=1 and\nthey should have formed their stars and assembled their mass at higher z.

The fact that no moving shocks or plasmoids are seen on\nthe parsec-scale suggests that the shocks or plasmoids that are assumed to be\nresponsible for the high-energy flares must dissipate before they separate from\nthe core on the VLBI images.

We propose an explicit\nphysical model for disc variability, consistent with Lyubarskii's (1997)\ngeneral scheme for solving this problem. We suggest that local dynamo processes\ncan affect the evolution of an accretion disc by driving angular momentum loss\nin the form of an outflow (a wind or jet). We model the dynamo as a small-scale\nstochastic phenomenon, operating on roughly the local dynamical timescale. We\nargue that large-scale outflow can only occur when the small-scale random\nprocesses in neighbouring disc annuli give rise by chance to a coherent\nlarge-scale magnetic field. This occurs on much longer timescales, and causes a\nbright large-amplitude flare as a wide range of disc radii evolve in a coherent\nfashion. Most of the time, dynamo action instead produces small-amplitude\nflickering. We reproduce power spectra similar to those observed, including a\n1/f power spectrum below a break frequency given by the magnetic alignment\ntimescale at the inner disc edge. However the relation between the black hole\nmass and the value of the break frequency is less straightforward than often\nassumed in the literature. The effect of an outer disc edge is to flatten the\nspectrum below the magnetic alignment frequency there.

During pre-eruption the object seemed to be\nrelaxing after an initial event which had presumably taken place in last days\nof December 2001. The eruption phase, which lasted till mid-April 2002,\nresulted from a very strong energy burst, which presumably took place in last\ndays of January at the base of the stellar envelope inflated in pre-eruption.\nThe burst produced an energy wave, which was observed as a strong luminosity\nflash in the beginning of February, followed by a strong mass outflow in form\nof two shells, which was observed as an expanding photosphere in later epochs.\nIn mid-April, when the outflow became optically transparent and most of its\nenergy radiated away, the object entered the decline phase during which V838\nMon was evolving along the Hayashi track.

This\npaper confronts the ultra-compact assumption with the observed properties of\nthis pulsar. The gravitational potential well of an ultra-compact binary can\nenlarge the corotation radius and thus make it possible for accreting material\nto reach the surface of the NS in the low accretion rate case. Thus the\ngeneration of the absorption features should be similar to the case of\naccreting pulsars. The close equality of the energy loss by fast cooling of the\npostsupernova neutron star and the energy dissipation needed for a wide binary\nevolving to an ultra-compact binary demonstrates that the ultra-compact binary\nmay be formed in 10-100yr after the second supernova explosion.

Recently, a two component jet model has also been considered, with a\nnarrow uniform jet of initial Lorentz factor $\\Gamma_0 \\gtrsim 100$ surrounded\nby a wider uniform jet with $\\Gamma_0 \\sim 10-30$. Some models predict more\nexotic jet profiles, such as a thin uniform ring (i.e. the outflow is bounded\nby two concentric cones of half opening angle $\\theta_c$ and $\\theta_c +\n\\Delta\\theta$, with $\\Delta\\theta \\ll \\theta_c$) or a fan (a thin outflow with\n$\\Delta\\theta \\ll 1$ along the rotational equator, $\\theta_c = \\pi/2 +\n\\Delta\\theta/2$).

Based on an optically thick wind model\nof nova outbursts, we have calculated light curves and searched for the best\nfit model that is consistent with optical, UV, and X-ray observations. Our best\nfit model is a white dwarf (WD) of mass 1.05 M_\\sun with a chemical composition\nof X=0.46, C+N+O=0.15, and Ne = 0.05 by mass weight. Both supersoft X-ray and\ncontinuum UV 1455 \\AA light curves are well reproduced. Supersoft X-rays\nemerged on day ~ 250 after outburst, which is naturally explained by our model:\nour optically thick winds cease on day 245 and supersoft X-rays emerge from\nself-absorption by the winds. The X-ray flux keeps a constant peak value for ~\n300 days followed by a quick decay on day ~ 600. The duration of X-ray flat\npeak is well reproduced by a steady hydrogen shell burning on the WD. Optical\nlight curve is also explained by the same model if we introduce free-free\nemission from optically thin ejecta. A t^{-1.5} slope of the observed optical\nand infrared fluxes is very close to the slope of our modeled free-free light\ncurve during the optically thick wind phase. Once the wind stops, optical and\ninfrared fluxes should follow a t^{-3} slope, derived from a constant mass of\nexpanding ejecta. An abrupt transition from a t^{-1.5} slope to a t^{-3} slope\nat day ~ 200 is naturally explained by the change from the wind phase to the\npost-wind phase on day ~ 200.

We examine a range of spiral strengths and spiral speeds\nand show that stars in this time dependent gravitational field can be heated\n(their random motions increased).This is particularly noticeable in the\nsimultaneous propagation of a 2-armed spiral density wave near the corotation\nresonance (CR), and a weak 4-armed one near the inner and outer 4:1 Lindblad\nresonances. In simulations with 2 spiral waves moving at different pattern\nspeeds we find: (1) the variance of the radial velocity, sigma_R^2, exceeds the\nsum of the variances measured from simulations with each individual pattern;\n(2) sigma_R^2 can grow with time throughout the entire simulation; (3)\nsigma_R^2 is increased over a wider range of radii compared to that seen with\none spiral pattern; (4) particles diffuse radially in real space whereas they\ndon't when only one spiral density wave is present.

Formally, this minimization problem is\nsimilar to a condition of ``canonical stability'' in thermodynamics. A stellar\nsystem that maximizes an H-function at fixed mass and energy is a nonlinearly\ndynamically stable stationary solution of the Vlasov-Poisson system. Formally,\nthis maximization problem is similar to a condition of ``microcanonical\nstability'' in thermodynamics. Using a thermodynamical analogy, we provide a\nderivation and an interpretation of the nonlinear Antonov first law in terms of\n``ensembles inequivalence'': a spherical stellar system with f=f(epsilon) and\nf'(epsilon)<0 is nonlinearly dynamically stable with respect to the\nVlasov-Poisson system if the corresponding barotropic star with the same\nequilibrium density distribution is nonlinearly dynamically stable with respect\nto the Euler-Poisson system.

We point out that the highest values of the hard-state\n$L$ are substantially above the $L$ an advection-dominated accretion flow\n(ADAF) can produce, $\\sim 0.4\\alpha^2 L_{\\rm E}$, which is only $\\sim\n(3$--$4)%L_{\\rm E}$ even for $\\alpha$ as high as 0.3. On the other hand, we\nsuccessfully explain the hard states with $L\\sim (4$--$10)%$ using the luminous\nhot accretion flow (LHAF) model. As $10%L_{\\rm E}$ is also roughly the highest\nluminosity an LHAF can produce, such an agreement between the predicted and\nobserved highest luminosities provides by itself strong support for this model.\nThen, we study multi-waveband spectral variability during the 2000 outburst. In\naddition to the primary maxima in the optical light curves, secondary maxima\nwere detected after the transition from the very high state to the hard state.\nWe show that the secondary maxima are well modeled by synchrotron emission from\na jet formed during the state transition. We argue that the absence of the\ncorresponding secondary peak in the X-ray light curve indicates that the X-ray\njet emission, regardless of its radiative process, synchrotron or its\nComptonization, is not important in the hard state compared to the emission\nfrom the accretion flow. \n\n"}

The primary aim is to determine the role that groups play in driving\nthe evolution of galaxy colour at high z. The colour segregation observed\nbetween local group and field samples is already in place at z ~ 1: DEEP2\ngroups have a significantly lower blue fraction than the field. At fixed z,\nthere is also a correlation between blue fraction and galaxy magnitude, such\nthat brighter galaxies are more likely to be red, both in groups and in the\nfield. In addition, there is a negative correlation between blue fraction and\ngroup richness. In terms of evolution, the blue fraction in groups and the\nfield remains roughly constant from z=0.75 to z ~ 1, but beyond this redshift\nthe blue fraction in groups rises rapidly with z, and the group and field blue\nfractions become indistinguishable at z ~ 1.3. Careful tests indicate that this\neffect does not arise from known systematic or selection effects. To further\nensure the robustness of this result, we build on previous mock DEEP2\ncatalogues to develop mock catalogues that reproduce the colour-overdensity\nrelation observed in DEEP2 and use these to test our methods. The convergence\nbetween the group and field blue fractions at z ~ 1.3 implies that DEEP2 galaxy\ngroups only became efficient at quenching star formation at z ~ 2; this result\nis broadly consistent with other recent observations and with current models of\ngalaxy evolution and hierarchical structure growth.

Abstract: We present multiwavelength observations of the gamma-ray burst GRB 051028\ndetected by HETE-2 in order to derive its afterglow emission parameters and to\ndetermine the reason for its optical faintness when compared to other events.\nObservations were taken in the optical (2.0m Himalayan Chandra Telescope, 1.34m\nTautenburg, 4.2m William Herschel Telescope) and in X-rays (Swift/XRT) between\n2.7 hours and 10 days after the onset of the event. The data can be interpreted\nby collimated emission in a jet with a typical value of $p$ = 2.4 which is\nmoving in an homogeneous interstellar medium and with a cooling frequency\nnu_{c} still above the X-rays at 0.5 days after the burst onset. GRB 051028 can\nbe classified as a ``gray'' or ``potentially dark'' GRB. On the basis of the\ncombined optical and Swift/XRT data, we conclude that the reason for the\noptical dimness is not extra absorption in the host galaxy, but rather the GRB\ntaking place at high-redshift.We also notice the very striking similarity with\nthe optical lightcurve of GRB 050730, a burst with a spectroscopic redshift of\n3.967, although GRB 051028 is about 3 mag fainter.

We focus on the sample of 25 galaxies in clusters at z=0.5 modeled\nin Paper I. For comparison we compile and homogenize M/L literature data for 60\nnearby galaxies that were modeled in comparable detail. The nearby sample obeys\nlog(M/L)_B = Z + S log(sigma_eff/[200 km/s]), with Z = 0.896 +/- 0.010, S =\n0.992 +/- 0.054, and sigma_eff the effective velocity dispersion.

The implied M/L\nevolution is Delta log(M/L) / Delta z = -0.457 +/- 0.046(random) +/-\n0.078(systematic), consistent with passive evolution following high-redshift\nformation. This agrees with the FP results for this sample by van Dokkum & van\nder Marel. This confirms that FP evolution tracks M/L evolution, which is an\nimportant verification of the assumptions that underly FP studies. However,\nwhile we find more FP evolution for galaxies of low sigma_eff (or low mass),\nthe dynamical M/L evolution instead shows little trend with sigma_eff. We argue\nthat this difference can be plausibly attributed to a combination of two\neffects: (a) evolution in structural galaxy properties other than M/L; and (b)\nthe neglect of rotational support in studies of FP evolution. The results leave\nthe question open whether the low-mass galaxies in the sample have younger\npopulation ages than the high-mass galaxies.

We focus\non the composition of the material that would be ejected as the white dwarfs\nare formed; abundance patterns in the ejecta strongly constrain white dwarf\nproduction scenarios. Using both analytical and numerical chemical evolution\nmodels, we confirm that very strong constraints come from Galactic Pop II and\nextragalactic carbon abundances. We also point out that depending on the\nstellar model, significant nitrogen is produced rather than carbon. The\ncombined constraints from C and N give $\\Omega_{WD} h < 2 \\times 10^{-4}$ from\ncomparison with the low C and N abundances in the Ly$\\alpha$ forest.

For a roughly circular\norbit, it is similar to narrow-band resonance described by the Mathieu\nequation. For an elliptic orbit, the instabilities exhibit tachyonic nature. In\nthe narrow-band regime, we show that the existence of the instabilities is\ncrucial to the formation of $Q$-balls. The $Q$-ball formation proceeds through\nquasi-stable state called ``$I$-ball''. The transition from $I$-balls to\n$Q$-balls is made efficient by the $D$-term instability and during this process\nsome fraction of the charge of the $Q$-ball is emitted. This discovery may\nrevive the scenario which relates the baryon number and dark matter density of\nthe universe.

In this context, baryogenesis appears to be\nproblematic: if the involved physics is essentially that of the Standard Model,\n``conventional'' non-conserving baryon number processes are completely\nnegligible at such low temperatures.

It emerges that the limit $\\omega = -3/2$ is consistent only with\nthe vacuum field equations and it makes such a Brans-Dicke theory conformally\ninvariant. Then it is an example of the conformal relativity theory which\nallows the invariance with respect to conformal transformations of the metric.\nBesides, Brans-Dicke theory with $\\omega = -3/2$ gives a border between a\nstandard scalar field model and a ghost/phantom model.\n  In this paper we show that in $\\omega = -3/2$ Brans-Dicke theory, i.e., in\nthe conformal relativity there are no isotropic Friedmann solutions of non-zero\nspatial curvature except for $k=-1$ case.
