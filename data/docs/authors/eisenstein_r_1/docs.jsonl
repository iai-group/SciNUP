Here r is the tensor-to-scalar ratio,\nconstrained by cosmic-microwave-background (CMB) experiments; and Omega_gw(f)\nis the energy spectrum of primordial gravitational-waves, constrained e.g. by\npulsar-timing measurements, laser-interferometer experiments, and Big Bang\nNucleosynthesis (BBN). Differentiating the master equation yields a new\nexpression for the tilt d(ln Omega_gw(f))/d(ln f). The relationship between r\nand Omega_gw(f) depends sensitively on the uncertain physics of the early\nuniverse, and we show that this uncertainty may be encapsulated (in a\nmodel-independent way) by two quantities: w_hat(f) and nt_hat(f), where\nnt_hat(f) is a certain logarithmic average over nt(k) (the primordial tensor\nspectral index); and w_hat(f) is a certain logarithmic average over w_tilde(a)\n(the effective equation-of-state in the early universe, after horizon\nre-entry). Here the effective equation-of-state parameter w_tilde(a) is a\ncombination of the ordinary equation-of-state parameter w(a) and the bulk\nviscosity zeta(a). Thus, by comparing constraints on r and Omega_gw(f), one can\nobtain (remarkably tight) constraints in the [w_hat(f), nt_hat(f)] plane. In\nparticular, this is the best way to constrain (or detect) the presence of a\n``stiff'' energy component (with w > 1/3) in the early universe, prior to BBN.\nFinally, although most of our analysis does not assume inflation, we point out\nthat if CMB experiments detect a non-zero value for r, then we will immediately\nobtain (as a free by-product) a new upper bound w_hat < 0.55 on the\nlogarithmically averaged effective equation-of-state parameter during the\n``primordial dark age'' between the end of inflation and the start of BBN. \n\n"}

We begin\nin this paper with a derivation of the self-force on a compact object moving in\nthe background spacetime of a supermassive black hole. The EFT approach\nutilizes the disparity between two length scales, which in this problem are the\nsize of the compact object and the radius of curvature of the background\nspacetime, to treat the orbital dynamics of the compact object, described as an\neffective point particle, separately from its tidal deformations. Ultraviolet\ndivergences are regularized using Hadamard's {\\it partie finie} to isolate the\nnon-local finite part from the quasi-local divergent part. The latter is\nconstructed from a momentum space representation for the graviton retarded\npropagator and is evaluated using dimensional regularization in which only\nlogarithmic divergences are relevant for renormalizing the parameters of the\ntheory. As a first important application of this framework we explicitly derive\nthe first order self-force given by Mino, Sasaki, Tanaka, Quinn and Wald.

We investigate possible signatures of this theory in the gravitational wave\nemission produced in the inspiral of stellar compact objects into massive black\nholes, both for intermediate- and extreme-mass ratios. We use the\nsemi-relativistic approximation, where the trajectories are geodesics of the\nmassive black hole geometry and the gravitational waveforms are obtained from a\nmultipolar decomposition of the radiative field. The main CS corrections to the\nwaveforms arise from modifications to the geodesic trajectories, due to changes\nto the massive black hole geometry, and manifest themselves as an accumulating\ndephasing relative to the general relativistic case.

Instead, such a field describes a nonsingular particle whose spatial\ndimension is at least on the order of its Cartan radius. In particular, torsion\nmodifies Burinskii's model of the Dirac electron as a Kerr-Newman singular ring\nof the Compton size, by replacing the ring with a toroidal structure with the\nouter radius of the Compton size and the inner radius of the Cartan size. We\nconjecture that torsion produced by spin prevents the formation of\nsingularities from matter composed of quarks and leptons. We expect that the\nCartan radius of an electron, ~10^{-27} m, introduces an effective ultraviolet\ncutoff in quantum field theory for fermions in the ECKS spacetime. We also\nestimate a maximum density of matter to be on the order of the corresponding\nCartan density, ~10^{51} kg m^{-3}, which gives a lower limit for black-hole\nmasses ~10^{16} kg. This limit corresponds to energy ~10^{43} GeV which is 39\norders of magnitude larger than the maximum beam energy currently available at\nthe LHC.

We expect to be able to detect and analyze\nmany cycles of these slowly inspiraling systems. To that end, the use of very\nprecise theoretical waveform templates in the data analysis is required.

In this paper we extend a new time-domain\ntechnique for the computation of the self-force from the circular case to the\ncase of eccentric orbits around a non-rotating black hole. The main idea behind\nour scheme is to use a multidomain framework in which the small compact object,\ndescribed as a particle, is located at the interface between two subdomains.\nThen, the equations at each subdomain are homogeneous wave-type equations,\nwithout distributional sources.

The\nspectrum found shows a number of peculiar features, which are absent in the\nMinkowski space-time. A hypothetical particle that moves faster than light,\n\\emph{a tachyon}, is known to be classically unstable in the Minkowski\nspace-time. This instability has its analog at the quantum level: small vacuum\nfluctuations of the field lead to the unbounded growth of the amplitude, so\nthat the appearance of the real tachyons in the spectrum means that there is\ncatastrophic instability in the theory. It has been conjectured a long time ago\nthat possibly the lightest particles with nonzero mass, the neutrino, may be a\ntachyon. Here we shall show that in the rotating and expanding Universe\ntachyons are stable if their mass is less than some constant, which is related\nto the Universe's rotation and expansion scales. The current upper bound on the\nrotation scale gives us a very small upper bound on the tachyon's mass which is\nmany orders less than the mass of the electron.

At the same time, this result disproved the\nmodel of a single black hole system with accretion disk oscillations, as well\nas several toy models of binaries without relativistic precession.

This was\nconfirmed by combined ground based and ultraviolet observations using the\nXMM-Newton X-ray telescope. (3) A secondary outburst of the same nature was\nexpected at 2007 September 13. Within the accuracy of the observations (about 6\nhours), it started at the correct time. Due to the bremsstrahlung nature of the\noutburst, the radiation was unpolarized, as expected.

Some more complex results may reveal aspects of a\ncoupled disk-corona-jet system. A positive correlation between the reflected\nX-ray flux and radio flux may represent specific support for a plasma ejection\nmodel of the corona, wherein the base of a jet produces hard X-ray emission.\nWithin the framework of the plasma ejection model, the spectra suggest a jet\nbase with v/c ~ 0.3, or the escape velocity for a vertical height of z ~ 20\nGM/c^2 above the black hole.

It is well-known that the equatorial\ncircular geodesics of the Kerr spacetime (the prograde and the retrograde\norbits with cos i=\\pm 1) are characterized by a monotonic dependence of their\nradii r_{ph}(a/M;cos i=\\pm 1) on the dimensionless spin-parameter a/M of the\nblack hole. We use here our novel analytical formula to reveal that this\nwell-known property of the equatorial circular geodesics is actually not a\ngeneric property of the Kerr spacetime. In particular, we find that\ncounter-rotating spherical null orbits in the range (3\\sqrt{3}-\\sqrt{59})/4\n\\lesssim \\cos i<0 are characterized by a non-monotonic dependence of\nr_{ph}(a/M;cos i=const) on the dimensionless rotation parameter a/M of the\nblack hole. Furthermore, it is shown that spherical photon orbits of\nrapidly-rotating black holes are characterized by a critical inclination angle,\ncos i=\\sqrt{4/7}, above which the coordinate radii of the orbits approach the\nblack-hole radius in the extremal limit. We prove that this critical\ninclination angle signals a transition in the physical properties of the\nspherical null geodesics: in particular, it separates orbits which are\ncharacterized by finite proper distances to the black-hole horizon from orbits\nwhich are characterized by infinite proper distances to the horizon. \n\n"}

To this end, we perform 3D general-relativistic\nsimulations with a 3-species neutrino leakage scheme. The leakage scheme\ncaptures the essential aspects of neutrino cooling, heating, and lepton number\nexchange as predicted by radiation-hydrodynamics simulations. The 27-solar-mass\nprogenitor was studied in 2D by B. Mueller et al. (ApJ 761:72, 2012), who\nobserved strong growth of the SASI while neutrino-driven convection was\nsuppressed. In our 3D simulations, neutrino-driven convection grows from\nnumerical perturbations imposed by our Cartesian grid. It becomes the dominant\ninstability and leads to large-scale non-oscillatory deformations of the shock\nfront. These will result in strongly aspherical explosions without the need for\nlarge-scale SASI shock oscillations. Low-l-mode SASI oscillations are present\nin our models, but saturate at small amplitudes that decrease with increasing\nneutrino heating and vigor of convection. Our results, in agreement with\nsimpler 3D Newtonian simulations, suggest that once neutrino-driven convection\nis started, it is likely to become the dominant instability in 3D. Whether it\nis the primary instability after bounce will ultimately depend on the physical\nseed perturbations present in the cores of massive stars. The gravitational\nwave signal, which we extract and analyze for the first time from 3D\ngeneral-relativistic models, will serve as an observational probe of the\npostbounce dynamics and, in combination with neutrinos, may allow us to\ndetermine the primary hydrodynamic instability. \n\n"}

Instead, we consider different degrees of anisotropy in the\nfueling, never confining to accretion events on a fixed direction. We follow\nthe black hole growth evolving contemporarily mass, spin modulus a and spin\ndirection. We discover the occurrence of two regimes. An early phase (M <~ 10\nmillion solar masses) in which rapid alignment of the black hole spin direction\nto the disk angular momentum in each single episode leads to erratic changes in\nthe black hole spin orientation and at the same time to large spins (a ~ 0.8).\nA second phase starts when the black hole mass increases above >~ 10 million\nsolar masses and the accretion disks carry less mass and angular momentum\nrelatively to the hole.

Following recent theoretical models of wind mass loss and core\ncollapse supernovae, we assume that the mass of the stellar remnants depends on\nthe metallicity of the progenitor stars. In particular, massive metal-poor\nstars (Z<=0.3 Zsun) are enabled to form massive stellar black holes (MSBHs,\nwith mass >=25 Msun) through direct collapse. We find that three-body\nencounters, and especially dynamical exchanges, dominate the evolution of the\nMSBHs formed in our simulations. In SCs with Z=0.01 and 0.1 Zsun, about 75 per\ncent of simulated MSBHs form from single stars and become members of binaries\nthrough dynamical exchanges in the first 100 Myr of the SC life. This is a\nfactor of >~3 more efficient than in the case of low-mass (<25 Msun) stellar\nblack holes.

The behavior of both\nthe spacetime (and thus the emitted gravitational waves) and the neutron star\nmatter in a BHNS merger depend strongly and nonlinearly on the black hole's\nspin. While there is a significant possibility that astrophysical black holes\ncould have spins that are nearly extremal (i.e. near the theoretical maximum),\nto date fully relativistic simulations of BHNS binaries have included\nblack-hole spins only up to $S/M^2$=0.9, which corresponds to the black hole\nhaving approximately half as much rotational energy as possible, given the\nblack hole's mass.

Here we\nshall present a comprehensive picture of quasinormal modes, late-time tails and\nstability of a massive charged scalar field around Kerr-Newman black holes for\nany physically meaningful values of the parameters. We shall show that despite\npresence of the two mechanisms of superradiance (owing to black hole's rotation\nand charge) and the massive term creating growing bound states, there is no\nindication of instability under quasinormal modes' boundary conditions. We have\nshown that for some moderate values of qQ dominant quasinormal modes may have\narbitrarily small real oscillation frequencies Re(\\omega).

In addition, the radioactive decay of elements produced in NS\nbinary mergers may result in transients visible in the optical and infrared\nwith peak luminosities on hours-days timescales. Simultaneous observations of\nthe inspiral GWs and signatures in the electromagnetic band may allow us to\ndirectly and independently determine both the luminosity distance and redshift\nto a binary.

The templates map the waveform shapes to physical\nparameters, thus allowing us to produce posterior probability distributions for\nthese parameters. However, there are attendant dangers in using highly\nrestrictive signal priors. If strong field gravity is not accurately described\nby General Relativity (GR), then using GR templates may result in fundamental\nbias in the recovered parameters, or even worse, a complete failure to detect\nsignals.

Abstract: Neutron stars (NSs) are thought to be excellent laboratories for determining\nthe equation of state (EoS) of cold dense matter. Their strong gravity suggests\nthat they can also be used to constrain gravity models. The mass and radius\n(M-R) of a NS both depend on the choice of EoS and gravity, meaning that NSs\ncannot be simultaneously good laboratories for both of these questions. A\nmeasurement of M-R would constrain the less well known physics input. The\nassumption that M-R measurements can be used to constrain EoS-presumes general\nrelativity (GR) is the ultimate model of gravity in the classical regime. We\ncalculate the radial profile of compactness and curvature (square root of the\nfull contraction of the Weyl tensor) within a NS and determine the domain not\nprobed by the Solar System tests of GR. We find that, except for a tiny sphere\nof radius less than a millimeter at the center, the curvature is several orders\nof magnitude above the values present in Solar System tests. The compactness is\nbeyond the solar surface value for r>10 m, and increases by 5 orders of\nmagnitude towards the surface. With the density being only an order of\nmagnitude higher than that probed by nuclear scattering experiments, our\nresults suggest that the employment of GR as the theory of gravity describing\nthe hydrostatic equilibrium of NSs is a rather remarkable extrapolation from\nthe regime of tested validity, as opposed to that of EoS models. Our larger\nignorance of gravity within NSs suggests that a measurement of M-R constrains\ngravity rather than EoS, and given that EoS has yet to be determined by nucleon\nscattering experiments, M-R measurements cannot tightly constrain the gravity\nmodels either.

Furthermore, the Hulse-Taylor pulsar provided the first test bed for\nthe orbital dynamics of strongly self-gravitating bodies.\n  To date there are a number of pulsars known, which can be utilized for\nprecision test of gravity. Depending on their orbital properties and their\ncompanion, these pulsars provide tests for various different aspects of\nrelativistic dynamics. Besides tests of specific gravity theories, like general\nrelativity or scalar-tensor gravity, there are pulsars that allow for generic\nconstraints on potential deviations of gravity from general relativity in the\nquasi-stationary strong-field and the radiative regime.\n  This article presents a brief overview of this modern field of relativistic\ncelestial mechanics, reviews some of the highlights of gravity tests with radio\npulsars, and discusses their implications for gravitational physics and\nastronomy, including the upcoming gravitational wave astronomy. \n\n"}

These relations\nare quasiuniversal in the sense that, for a given value of the tidal coupling\nconstant, they depend significantly neither on the equation of state nor on the\nmass ratio, though they do depend on stars spins. The spin dependence is\napproximately linear for small spins aligned with the orbital angular momentum.\nThe quasiuniversality is a property of the conservative dynamics; nontrivial\nrelations emerge as the binary interaction becomes tidally dominated. This\nanalytical prediction is qualitatively consistent with new, multi-orbit\nnumerical relativity results for the relevant case of equal-mass irrotational\nbinaries.

Thus a measurement of the structure growth, e.g.,\nredshift-space distortions (RSD), can provide a powerful tool to constrain the\ninteracting dark energy (IDE) models. For the widely studied $Q=3\\beta\nH\\rho_{de}$ model, previous works showed that only a very small coupling\n($\\beta\\sim\\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$) can survive in current RSD data. However, all\nthese analyses had to assume $w>-1$ and $\\beta>0$ due to the existence of the\nlarge-scale instability in the IDE scenario. In our recent work [Phys. Rev. D\n90, 063005 (2014)], we successfully solved this large-scale instability problem\nby establishing a parametrized post-Friedmann (PPF) framework for the IDE\nscenario. So we, for the first time, have the ability to explore the full\nparameter space of the IDE models. In this work, we reexamine the observational\nconstraints on the $Q=3\\beta H\\rho_{de}$ model within the PPF framework.

The sensitivity of such cross-correlation analyses depends, among\nother things, on the separation between the two detectors: the smaller the\nseparation, the better the sensitivity. Hence, a co-located detector pair is\nmore sensitive to a gravitational-wave background than a non-co-located\ndetector pair. However, co-located detectors are also expected to suffer from\ncorrelated noise from instrumental and environmental effects that could\ncontaminate the measurement of the background.

Here we report on the first\nSGWB analysis using the two LIGO Hanford detectors and address the\ncomplications arising from correlated environmental noise. We apply correlated\nnoise identification and mitigation techniques to data taken by the two LIGO\nHanford detectors, H1 and H2, during LIGO's fifth science run.

The physical mechanism responsible for the development of these\nexponentially growing instabilities is the superradiant amplification of\nbosonic fields confined between the black hole and the mirror. A remarkable\nfeature of this composed black-hole-mirror-field system is the existence of a\ncritical mirror radius, $r^{\\text{stat}}_{\\text{m}}$, which supports {\\it\nstationary} (marginally-stable) field configurations. This critical\n(`stationary') mirror radius marks the boundary between stable and unstable\nblack-hole-mirror-field configurations: composed systems whose confining mirror\nis situated in the region $r_{\\text{m}}<r^{\\text{stat}}_{\\text{m}}$ are stable\n(that is, all modes of the confined field decay in time), whereas composed\nsystems whose confining mirror is situated in the region\n$r_{\\text{m}}>r^{\\text{stat}}_{\\text{m}}$ are unstable (that is, there are\nconfined field modes which grow exponentially over time).

Such metrics often contain\nnaked singularities or closed timelike curves in the vicinity of the compact\nobjects that can limit the applicability of the metrics to compact objects that\ndo not spin rapidly, and generally admit only two constants of motion. The\nexistence of a third constant, however, can facilitate the calculation of\nobservables, because the equations of motion can be written in first-order\nform. In this paper, I design a Kerr-like black hole metric which is regular\neverywhere outside of the event horizon, possesses three independent constants\nof motion, and depends nonlinearly on four free functions that parameterize\npotential deviations from the Kerr metric. This metric is generally not a\nsolution to the field equations of any particular gravity theory, but can be\nmapped to known four-dimensional black hole solutions of modified theories of\ngravity for suitable choices of the deviation functions. I derive expressions\nfor the energy, angular momentum, and epicyclic frequencies of a particle on a\ncircular equatorial orbit around the black hole and compute the location of the\ninnermost stable circular orbit.

For a Kerr black hole, the shape of this\nphoton ring is nearly circular unless the black hole spins very rapidly.\nWhether or not, however, astrophysical black holes are truly described by the\nKerr metric as encapsulated in the no-hair theorem still remains an untested\nassumption.

This\nsecondary peak is typically well separated in frequency from the secondary peak\nproduced by a nonlinear interaction between a quadrupole and a quasi-radial\noscillation. The new mechanism allows for an explanation of low-frequency\nmodulations seen in a number of physical characteristics of the remnant, such\nas the central lapse function, the maximum density and the separation between\nthe two cores.

In\nthis work, we show that these solutions can be unstable when the spin of the\nhigher-mass black hole is aligned with the orbital angular momentum and the\nspin of the lower-mass black hole is anti-aligned.

One such set of relations determines all of the multipole moments of a\nneutron star just from the first three (the mass monopole, the current dipole\nand the mass quadrupole moment) approximately independently of the equation of\nstate.

It is well-known that, in the small-mass limit\n$\\alpha\\equiv M\\mu\\ll1$ (here $\\mu$ is the mass of the scalar field), these\nquasi-stationary scalar resonances are characterized by the familiar hydrogenic\noscillation spectrum: $\\omega_{\\text{R}}/\\mu=1-\\alpha^2/2{\\bar n}^2_0$, where\nthe integer $\\bar n_0(l,n;\\alpha\\to0)=l+n+1$ is the principal quantum number of\nthe bound-state resonance (here the integers $l=1,2,3,...$ and $n=0,1,2,...$\nare the spheroidal harmonic index and the resonance parameter of the field\nmode, respectively). As it depends only on the principal resonance parameter\n$\\bar n_0$, this small-mass ($\\alpha\\ll1$) hydrogenic spectrum is obviously\ndegenerate.

For cases where the spin is aligned with the orbital angular\nmomentum, the additional centrifugal support in the remnant hypermassive\nneutron star can prevent the prompt collapse to a black hole, while for\nantialigned cases the decreased total angular momentum can facilitate the\ncollapse to a black hole. We show that even moderate spins can significantly\nincrease the amount of ejected material, including the amount unbound with\nvelocities greater than half the speed of light, leading to brighter\nelectromagnetic signatures associated with kilonovae and interaction of the\nejecta with the interstellar medium.

We present a preliminary analysis of the neutrino signal\npredicted by CITE and compare it to the neutrino burst of SN1987A. For strong\nCCSNe, as SN1987A, CITE predicts a proto-neutron star (PNS) accretion phase,\naccompanied by the corresponding neutrino luminosity, that can last a few\nseconds and that is cut-off abruptly by black hole (BH) formation. The neutrino\nluminosity can later be revived by accretion disc emission after a dead time of\nfew to a few ten seconds. In contrast, the neutrino mechanism for CCSNe\npredicts a shorter PNS accretion phase, followed by a slowly declining PNS\ncooling luminosity. We repeat statistical analyses used in the literature to\ninterpret the neutrino mechanism, and apply them to CITE. The first 1-2 sec of\nthe neutrino burst are equally compatible with CITE and with the neutrino\nmechanism. However, the data hints to a luminosity drop at t=2-3 sec, in some\ntension with the neutrino mechanism while being naturally attributed to BH\nformation in CITE. The occurrence of neutrino events at 5 sec in SN1987A\nsuggests that the accretion disc formed by that time. We perform 2D numerical\nsimulations, showing that CITE may be able to accommodate this disc formation\ntime while reproducing the ejected $^{56}$Ni mass and ejecta kinetic energy\nwithin factors 2-3 of observations.

We first review model-independent\nways of testing gravity with electromagnetic/gravitational waves from a black\nhole system.

To close this gap, we perform a comparative analysis of\nthe optical companion in two important systems: IGR J17544-2619 (SFXT) and Vela\nX-1 (SGXB).

With such an assumption, we are able to\nreconstruct the solution in the whole spacetime, namely in both the exterior\nand interior regions.

The extreme sensitivity required to make such detections is\nachieved through exquisite isolation of all sensitive components of LIGO from\nnon-gravitational-wave disturbances. Nonetheless, LIGO is still susceptible to\na variety of instrumental and environmental sources of noise that contaminate\nthe data. Of particular concern are noise features known as glitches, which are\ntransient and non-Gaussian in their nature, and occur at a high enough rate so\nthat accidental coincidence between the two LIGO detectors is non-negligible.\nIn this paper we describe an innovative project that combines crowdsourcing\nwith machine learning to aid in the challenging task of categorizing all of the\nglitches recorded by the LIGO detectors. Through the Zooniverse platform, we\nengage and recruit volunteers from the public to categorize images of glitches\ninto pre-identified morphological classes and to discover new classes that\nappear as the detectors evolve. In addition, machine learning algorithms are\nused to categorize images after being trained on human-classified examples of\nthe morphological classes. Leveraging the strengths of both classification\nmethods, we create a combined method with the aim of improving the efficiency\nand accuracy of each individual classifier. The resulting classification and\ncharacterization should help LIGO scientists to identify causes of glitches and\nsubsequently eliminate them from the data or the detector entirely, thereby\nimproving the rate and accuracy of gravitational-wave observations. We\ndemonstrate these methods using a small subset of data from LIGO's first\nobserving run. \n\n"}

Much of this may be caused\nby the requirement that the gravitational sphere of influence of the black hole\nmust be resolved for the black-hole mass to be reliably estimated. We revisit\nthis issue by using a comprehensive galaxy evolution semi-analytic model, which\nself-consistently evolves supermassive black holes from high-redshift seeds via\ngas accretion and mergers, and also includes AGN feedback. Once tuned to\nreproduce the (mean) correlation of black-hole mass with velocity dispersion,\nthe model is unable to also account for the correlation with stellar mass. This\nbehaviour is independent of the model's parameters, thus suggesting an internal\ninconsistency in the data. The predicted distributions, especially at the\nlow-mass end, are also much broader than observed. However, if selection\neffects are included, the model's predictions tend to align with the\nobservations. We also demonstrate that the correlations between the residuals\nof the local scaling relations are more effective than the scaling relations\nthemselves at constraining AGN feedback models. In fact, we find that our\nsemi-analytic model, while in apparent broad agreement with the scaling\nrelations when accounting for selection biases, yields very weak correlations\nbetween their residuals at fixed stellar mass, in stark contrast with\nobservations. This problem persists when changing the AGN feedback strength,\nand is also present in the $z\\sim 0$ outputs of the hydrodynamic cosmological\nsimulation Horizon-AGN, which includes state-of-the-art treatments of AGN\nfeedback. This suggests that current AGN feedback models may be too weak or are\nsimply not capturing the effect of the black hole on the stellar velocity\ndispersion. \n\n"}

While general relativity predicts only two\ntensor gravitational-wave polarizations, general metric theories of gravity\nallow for up to four additional vector and scalar modes. The detection of these\nalternative polarizations would represent a clear violation of general\nrelativity. The LIGO-Virgo detection of the binary black hole merger GW170814\nhas recently offered the first direct constraints on the polarization of\ngravitational waves. The current generation of ground-based detectors, however,\nis limited in its ability to sensitively determine the polarization content of\ntransient gravitational-wave signals. Observation of the stochastic\ngravitational-wave background, in contrast, offers a means of directly\nmeasuring generic gravitational-wave polarizations.

This resonant tide can induce phase shift in the\ngravitational waveforms, and potentially provide a new window of studying NS\ninterior using gravitational waves. Previous works have considered tidal\nexcitations of pure g-modes (due to stable stratification of the star) and pure\ninertial modes (due to Coriolis force), with the rotational effect treated in\nan approximate manner. However, for realistic NSs, the buoyancy and rotational\neffects can be comparable, giving rise to mixed inertial-gravity modes. We\ndevelop a non-perturbative numerical spectral code to compute the frequencies\nand tidal coupling coefficients of these modes. We then calculate the phase\nshift in the gravitational waveform due to each resonance during binary\ninspiral. We adopt polytropic NS models with a parameterized stratification. We\nderive relevant scaling relations and survey how the phase shift depends on\nvarious properties of the NS. We find that for canonical NSs (with mass M =\n1.4M_sun and radius R = 10 km) and modest rotation rates (< 300 Hz), the\ngravitational wave phase shift due to a resonance is generally less than 0.01\nradian. But the phase shift is a strong function of R and M, and can reach a\nradian or more for low-mass NSs with larger radii (R > 15 km). Significant\nphase shift can also be produced when the combination of stratification and\nrotation gives rise to a very low frequency (< 20 Hz in the inertial frame)\nmodified g-mode.

We resolve this conflict by invoking that\nthe Kruskcal coordinates could be no longer proper coordinates at the horizon.\nIn the Hartle-Hawking-Israel state, despite the negative finite proper energy\ndensity at the horizon, the Tolman temperature is divergent there due to the\ninfinite blueshift of the Hawking temperature. However, a consistent\nStefan-Boltzmann law with the Hawking radiation shows that the effective Tolman\ntemperature is eventually finite everywhere and the equivalence principle is\nsurprisingly restored at the horizon. Then, we also show that the firewall\nnecessarily emerges out of the Unruh vacuum, so that the Tolman temperature in\nthe evaporating black hole is naturally divergent due to the infinitely\nblueshifted negative ingoing flux crossing the horizon, whereas the outgoing\nHawking radiation characterized by the effective Tolman temperature indeed\noriginates from the quantum atmosphere, not just at the horizon.

Finally, as a cosmological application, the initial radiation energy\ndensity in warm inflation scenarios has been assumed to be finite when\ninflation starts.

The strong lensing region, moreover,\ncan be considerably smaller than the shadow of a BH with a comparable mass.\nDynamically, we investigate the fate of such UCOs under perturbations, via\nfully non-linear numerical simulations and observe that, in all cases, they\ndecay into a Schwarzschild BH within a time scale of $\\mathcal{O}(M)$, where\n$M$ is the mass of the bosonic star.

In\nmodels that include additional non-compact spacetime dimensions, as the\ngravitational waves propagate, they \"leak\" into the extra dimensions, leading\nto a reduction in the amplitude of the observed gravitational waves, and a\ncommensurate systematic error in the inferred distance to the gravitational\nwave source.

This revises the\nreported BBH distances upwards by an order of magnitude, equal to the square\nroot of the magnification. Furthermore, the reported black hole masses must be\ndecreased by 2-4 to counter the larger stretch factor, since the orbital\nfrequency is used to derive the black hole masses.

A\nparameter which is common to and plays a key role in both the GW and the EM\nanalyses is the viewing angle of the binary's orbit. If a binary is viewed from\ndifferent angles, the amount of GW energy changes (implying that orientation\nand distance are correlated) and the EM signatures can vary, depending on the\nstructure of the emission. Information about the viewing angle of the binary\norbital plane is therefore crucial to the interpretation of both the GW and the\nEM data, and can potentially be extracted from either side.\n  In the first part of this study, we present a systematic analysis of how well\nthe viewing angle of binary neutron stars can be measured from the GW data. We\nshow that if the sky position and the redshift of the binary can be identified\nvia the EM counterpart and an associated host galaxy, then for 50$\\%$ of the\nsystems the viewing angle can be constrained to $\\leq 7^{\\circ}$ uncertainty\nfrom the GW data, independent of electromagnetic emission models. On the other\nhand, if no redshift measurement is available, the measurement of the viewing\nangle with GW alone is not informative, unless the true viewing angle is close\nto $90^{\\circ}$. This holds true even if the sky position is measured\nindependently.\n  Then, we consider the case where some constraints on the viewing angle can be\nplaced from the EM data itself. We show that the EM measurements can then be\nused in the analysis of GW data to improve the precision of the luminosity\ndistance, and hence of the Hubble constant, by a factor of 2 to 3. \n\n"}

An\nindividual observation allows measurement of the black-hole masses, but only\nlimited information about either the magnitude or orientation of the black hole\nspins is available, primarily due to the degeneracy between measurements of\nspin and binary mass ratio. Using the first six black-hole merger observations,\nwe are able to constrain the distribution of black-hole spins. We perform model\nselection between a set of models with different spin population models\ncombined with a power-law mass distribution to make inferences about the spin\ndistribution. We assume a fixed power-law mass distribution on the black holes,\nwhich is supported by the data and provides a realistic distribution of binary\nmass-ratio. This allows us to accurately account for selection effects due to\nvariations in the signal amplitude with spin magnitude, and provides an\nimproved inference on the spin distribution.

Gravitomagnetic tidal fields as a mechanism\n  for binary-induced collapse Abstract: Numerical simulations of binary neutron stars by Wilson, Mathews, and\nMarronetti indicated that neutron stars that are stable in isolation can be\nmade to collapse to black holes when placed in a binary. This claim was\nsurprising as it ran counter to the Newtonian expectation that a neutron star\nin a binary should be more stable, not less. After correcting an error found by\nFlanagan, Wilson and Mathews found that the compression of the neutron stars\nwas significantly reduced but not eliminated. This has motivated us to ask the\nfollowing general question: Under what circumstances can general-relativistic\ntidal interactions cause an otherwise stable neutron star to be compressed? We\nhave found that if a nonrotating neutron star possesses a current-quadrupole\nmoment, interactions with a gravitomagnetic tidal field can lead to a\ncompressive force on the star. If this current quadrupole is induced by the\ngravitomagnetic tidal field, it is related to the tidal field by an\nequation-of-state-dependent constant called the gravitomagnetic Love number.\nThis is analogous to the Newtonian Love number that relates the strength of a\nNewtonian tidal field to the induced mass quadrupole moment of a star. The\ncompressive force is almost never larger than the Newtonian tidal interaction\nthat stabilizes the neutron star against collapse. In the case in which a\ncurrent quadrupole is already present in the star (perhaps as an artifact of a\nnumerical simulation), the compressive force can exceed the stabilizing one,\nleading to a net increase in the central density of the star. This increase is\nsmall (<~1%) but could, in principle, cause gravitational collapse in a star\nthat is close to its maximum mass. \n\n"}

This\npost-Newtonian gravitomagnetic driving of these modes dominates over the\nNewtonian tidal driving previously computed by Ho and Lai. To leading order in\nthe tidal expansion parameter R/r (where R is the radius of the neutron star\nand r is the orbital separation), only the l=2, |m|= 1 and |m| = 2 r-modes are\nexcited. The tidal work done on the star through this driving has an effect on\nthe evolution of the inspiral and on the phasing of the emitted gravitational\nwave signal. For a neutron star of mass M, radius R, spin frequency f_spin,\nmodeled as a Gamma =2 polytrope, with a companion also of mass M, the\ngravitational wave phase shift for the m=2 mode is\n(0.1radians)(R/10km)^4(M/1.4M_sun)^{-10/3}(f_spin/100Hz)^{2/3} for optimal spin\norientation.
