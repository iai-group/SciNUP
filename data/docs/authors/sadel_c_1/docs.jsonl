Beyond the\nfinite variance model, we also consider the case where the entries have heavy\ntails, by using the objective method of Aldous and Steele borrowed from\nrandomized combinatorial optimization. The limiting law is then no longer the\ncircular law and is related to the Poisson weighted infinite tree. We provide a\nweak control of the smallest singular value under weak assumptions, using\nasymptotic geometric analysis tools.

Applying expansions over the\nsymplectic basis of squared eigenfunctions, the integrability properties of the\nKdV hierarchy with generic self-consistent sources are analyzed. This allows\none to formulate a set of conditions on the perturbation terms that preserve\nthe integrability. The perturbation corrections to the scattering data and to\nthe corresponding action-angle variables are studied.

To that effect, we recall a remarkable phenomenon in the\ntheory of Schroedinger operators (discovered in 1981 by Jona-Lasinio et al),\naccording to which the ground state of a symmetric double-well Hamiltonian\nbecomes exponentially sensitive to tiny perturbations of the potential as h ->\n0.

A question for\nsimple choreographic solutions on $n$-body problems naturally arises: Are there\nany other stable simple choreographic solutions except the figure eight?\n  In this paper, we prove the existence of infinitely many simple choreographic\nsolutions in the classical Newtonian 4-body problem by developing a new\nvariational method with structural prescribed boundary conditions (SPBC).\nSurprisingly, a family of choreographic orbits of this type are all linearly\nstable. Among the many stable simple choreographic orbits, the most\nextraordinary one is the stable star pentagon choreographic solution. The star\npentagon is assembled out of four pieces of curves which are obtained by\nminimizing the Lagrangian action functional over the SPBC.\n  We also prove the existence of infinitely many double choreographic periodic\nsolutions, infinitely many non-choreographic periodic solutions and uncountably\nmany quasi-periodic solutions.

Those equations are formulated in a pseudo-Hamiltonian\nframework with action-angle coordinates; they contain a quasi-integrable\nconservative part and friction terms, assumed to be linear and isotropic with\nrespect to the action variables. In such a context, we transfer two methods\ndetermining quasi-periodic solutions, which were originally designed to analyze\npurely Hamiltonian quasi-integrable problems.\n  First, we show how the frequency map analysis can be adapted to this kind of\ndissipative models. Our approach is based on a key remark: the method can work\nas usual, by studying the behavior of the angular velocities of the motions as\na function of the so called \"external frequencies\", instead of the actions.\nMoreover, we explicitly implement the Kolmogorov's normalization algorithm for\nthe dissipative systems considered here.

{"id": "1405.0866", "contents": "Title: A General Mechanism of Diffusion in Hamiltonian Systems: Qualitative\n  Results Abstract: We present a general mechanism to establish the existence of diffusing orbits\nin a large class of nearly integrable Hamiltonian systems. Our approach relies\non successive applications of the `outer dynamics' along homoclinic orbits to a\nnormally hyperbolic invariant manifold. The information on the outer dynamics\nis encoded by a geometrically defined map, referred to as the `scattering map'.\n  We find pseudo-orbits of the scattering map that keep advancing in some\nprivileged direction. Then we use the recurrence property of the `inner\ndynamics', restricted to the normally hyperbolic invariant manifold, to return\nto those pseudo-orbits. Finally, we apply topological methods to show the\nexistence of true orbits that follow the successive applications of the two\ndynamics.\n  This method differs, in several crucial aspects, from earlier works. Unlike\nthe well known `two-dynamics' approach, the method we present relies on the\nouter dynamics alone. There are virtually no assumptions on the inner dynamics,\nas its invariant objects (e.g., primary and secondary tori, lower dimensional\nhyperbolic tori and their stable/unstable manifolds, Aubry-Mather sets) are not\nused at all.\n  The method applies to unperturbed Hamiltonians of arbitrary degrees of\nfreedom that are not necessarily convex. In addition, this mechanism is easy to\nverify (analytically or numerically) in concrete examples, as well as to\nestablish diffusion in generic systems.\n  We include several applications, such as bridging large gaps in a priori\nunstable models in any dimension, and establishing diffusion in cases when the\ninner dynamics is a non-twist map. \n\n"}

A basic feature of this set is a lower bound\nfor the sum of the three variances. We give a method for obtaining optimal\nlower bounds for uncertainty regions for general operator triples, and evaluate\nthese for small s. Further lower bounds are derived by generalizing the\ntechnique by which Robertson obtained his state-dependent lower bound.

Static balance points correspond to the\ncritical points of the particle's surface represented as a scalar distance\nfunction $r$, measured from the center of mass, so their time evolution can be\nexpressed as $N(r(t))$. The mathematical model of the particle can be\nconstructed on two scales: on the macro scale the particle may be viewed as a\nsmooth, convex manifold described by the smooth distance function $r$ with\n$N=N(r)$ equilibria, while on the micro scale the particle's natural model is a\nfinely discretized, convex polyhedral approximation $r^{\\Delta}$ of $r$, with\n$N^{\\Delta}=N(r^{\\Delta})$ equilibria. There is strong intuitive evidence\nsuggesting that under some particular evolution models $N(t)$ and\n$N^{\\Delta}(t)$ primarily evolve in the opposite manner. Here we create the\nmathematical framework necessary to understand these phenomenon more broadly,\nregardless of the particular evolution equation.

{"id": "nlin/0701063", "contents": "Title: Complex trajectories in chaotic dynamical tunneling Abstract: We develop the semiclassical method of complex trajectories in application to\nchaotic dynamical tunneling. First, we suggest a systematic numerical technique\nfor obtaining complex tunneling trajectories by the gradual deformation of the\nclassical ones. This provides a natural classification of the tunneling\nsolutions. Second, we present a heuristic procedure for sorting out the least\nsuppressed trajectory. As an illustration, we apply our technique to the\nprocess of chaotic tunneling in a quantum mechanical model with two degrees of\nfreedom. Our analysis reveals rich dynamics of the system. At the classical\nlevel, there exists an infinite set of unstable solutions forming a fractal\nstructure. This structure is inherited by the complex tunneling paths and plays\nthe central role in the semiclassical study. The process we consider exhibits\nthe phenomenon of optimal tunneling: the suppression exponent of the tunneling\nprobability has a local minimum at a certain energy which is thus (locally) the\noptimal energy for tunneling. We test the proposed method by comparison of the\nsemiclassical results with the results of the exact quantum computations and\nfind a good agreement. \n\n"}

As a consequence these states can withstand an\narbitrary amount of white noise before they admit a description within a local\nhidden variable model. This is in sharp contrast with the bipartite case, where\nall violations are bounded by Grothendieck's constant. We will discuss the\npossibility of determining the Hilbert space dimension from the obtained\nviolation and comment on implications for communication complexity theory.\nMoreover, we show that the violation obtained from generalized GHZ states is\nalways bounded so that, in contrast to many other contexts, GHZ states do in\nthis case not lead to extremal quantum correlations.
