Using Kubo linear-response theory and a recently proposed\ndefinition for the (conserved) spin current operator suitable for spin-3/2\nholes, it is shown that the spin conductivity tensor exhibit very\ndistinguishable features from those obtained with the standard definition of\nthe spin current.

The DC Josephson effect is\nthe pseudo-Goldstone boson of two coupled systems with a broken continuous\nabelian U(1) symmetry. Hence, an analog should exist for systems with broken\ncontinuous non-Abelian symmetries. To exhibit the generality of the phenomenon\nand make predictions from a realistic model, we study tunneling between\nantiferromagnets and also between antiferromagnetic d-wave superconductors.\nPerforming a calculation analogous to that of Ambegaokar and Baratoff for the\nJosephson junction, we find an equilibrium current of the staggered\nmagnetization through the junction that, in antiferromagnets, is proportional\nto s_L X s_R where s_L and s_R are the Neel vectors on either sides of the\njunction.

The second effect instead involves\nthe many-body interaction among ionic quasi-particles of the same sign, and\noccurs when the pore has a finite capacitance to accommodate ions so that there\nis a threshold concentration beyond which ions of the same sign are not\nenergetically allowed to enter the pore. Similar to the electron transport\ncase, the ionic counterpart appears only in the `quantum' regime, when the\nhydration layers forming the ionic quasi-particles need to break in order to\npass through the pore. Here, we review all these phenomena, and discuss the\nconditions under which they may be detected making the analogy with the\nelectronic transport case. Since nanopores are being considered for a host of\ntechnological applications in DNA sequencing and detection, we expect these\nphenomena will become very relevant and their understanding paramount to\nprogress. \n\n"}

Under degeneracy of the electron gas (high concentration, low\ntemperature), a dip at the center of the polarization profile appears with a\npolarization maximum at a distance of about $2 \\; \\mu m$ from the center.

In the current work, we\ntheoretically study the relevance of Migdal's theorem in graphene and Weyl\nsemimetals which are examples of 2D and 3D Dirac materials, respectively, with\nlinear and chiral band dispersion. Our work also applies to 2D and 3D\ntopological insulator systems. In Fermi liquids, the renormalization of the\nelectron-phonon vertex scales as the ratio of sound ($v_s$) to Fermi ($v_F$)\nvelocity, which is typically a small quantity. In two- and three-dimensional\nquasirelativistic systems, such as undoped graphene and Weyl semimetals, the\none loop electron-phonon vertex renormalization, which also scales as\n$\\eta=v_s/v_F$ as $\\eta \\rightarrow 0$, is, however, enhanced by an ultraviolet\n\\emph{logarithmic divergent correction}, arising from the linear, chiral Dirac\nband dispersion. Such enhancement of the electron-phonon vertex can be\nsignificantly softened due to the logarithmic increment of the Fermi velocity,\narising from the long range Coulomb interaction, and therefore, the\nelectron-phonon vertex correction does not have a logarithmic divergence at low\nenergy. Otherwise, the Coulomb interaction does not lead to any additional\nrenormalization of the electron-phonon vertex. Therefore, electron-phonon\nvertex corrections in two- and three-dimensional Dirac fermionic systems scale\nas $v_s/v^0_F$, where $v^0_F$ is the bare Fermi velocity, and small when $v_s\n\\ll v^0_F$. These results, although explicitly derived for the intrinsic\nundoped systems, should hold even when the chemical potential is tuned away\nfrom the Dirac points. \n\n"}

Being low mass bosons,\nthese light-matter quasiparticles can condense at comparably high temperatures\nup to 300K, while preserving fundamental properties such as coherence in space\nand time domain even when they are out of equilibrium with the environment.\nAlthough the presence of an in-plane polariton confinement potential is not\nstrictly necessary in order to observe condensation of polaritons, engineering\nthe polariton confinement is a key to controlling, shaping and directing the\nflow of polaritons. Prototype polariton-based optoelectronic devices rely on\nultrafast photon-like velocities and strong nonlinearities, as well as on\ntailored confinement.

These spin singlets can be used to store\nquantum correlations since they preserve entanglement even under dissipation,\ndriving and dipole-dipole interactions. One of the features for these dark\nstates is that their eigenenergies are independent of the qubitphoton coupling\nstrength. We have obtained a novel kind of dark-like states for the multi-qubit\nand multi-photon Rabi models, whose eigenenergies are also constant in the\nwhole coupling regime. Unlike the dark states, the qubits and photon field are\ncoupled in the dark-like states. Furthermore, the photon numbers are bounded\nfrom above commonly at 1, which is different from that for the one-qubit case.\nThe existence conditions of the dark-like states are simpler than exact\nisolated solutions, and may be fine tuned in experiments. While the\nsingle-qubit and multi-photon Rabi model is well-defined only if the photon\nnumber $M\\leq2$ and the coupling strength is below a certain critical value,\nthe dark-like eigenstates for multi-qubit and multiphoton Rabi model still\nexist, regardless of these constraints. In view of these properties of the\ndark-like states, they may find similar applications like \"dark states\" in\nquantum information. \n\n"}

For the HFB approximation, we\npresent a general projection formula for a condensate that is time-reversal\ninvariant and a simpler formula for the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) limit,\nwhich is realized in nuclei with spherical condensates. We apply the method to\nthree heavy nuclei: a typical deformed nucleus $^{162}$Dy, a typical spherical\nnucleus $^{148}$Sm, and a transitional nucleus $^{150}$Sm in which the pairing\ncondensate is deformed.

The central idea is to exploit the spin correlations naturally present\nin superconductors in form of Cooper pairs. We show that nonlocal\nspin-entanglement in form of an effective Heisenberg spin interaction is\ninduced between electron spins residing on two quantum dots with no direct\ncoupling between them but each of them being tunnel-coupled to the same\nsuperconductor. We then discuss a nonequilibrium setup where mobile and\nnonlocal spin-entanglement can be created by coherent injection of two\nelectrons in an Andreev tunneling process into two spatially separated quantum\ndots and subsequently into two Fermi-liquid leads. The current for injecting\ntwo spin-entangled electrons into different leads shows a resonance whereas\ntunneling via the same dot into the same lead is suppressed by the Coulomb\nblockade effect of the quantum dots. The Aharonov-Bohm oscillations in the\ncurrent are shown to contain h/e and h/2e periods. Finally we discuss a\nstructure consisting of a superconductor weakly coupled to two separate\nLuttinger liquid leads.

In contrast to the MOSFET, whose I-V is largely dominated by\nclassical electrostatics, the I-V characteristics of molecules is determined by\na more interesting interplay between nineteenth century physics\n(electrostatics) and twentieth century physics (quantum transport) and it is\nimportant to do justice to both aspects.\n  We start with a qualitative discussion of the main factors affecting the I-V\ncharacteristics of molecular conductors, using a simple toy model to illustrate\ntheir role. Including the effects of: (1) Shift in the energy level due to\ncharging effects and (2) broadening of the energy levels due to the coupling to\nthe two contacts we obtain realistic I-V plots, even though the toy model\nassumes that conduction takes place independently through individual molecular\nlevels.

Confinement plays a major role in\nmodifying SWNT phonons and is often more relevant than curvature. Due to their\none-dimensional character, metallic tubes are expected to undergo Peierls\ndistortions (PD) at T=0K. At finite temperature, PD are no longer present, but\nphonons with atomic displacements similar to those of the PD are affected by\nstrong Kohn anomalies (KA). We investigate by Density Functional Theory (DFT)\nKA and PD in metallic SWNTs with diameters up to 3 nm, in the electronic\ntemperature range from 4K to 3000 K.

Stress paths can\ncause random focussing of stresses (large fluctuations) as well as systematic\ndeflections (arching). We describe simple physical models that capture some of\nthese effects. In these models, the `stress paths' become identified with the\ncharacteristic `light rays' of wavelike (hyperbolic) equations for force\npropagation.

In the limit in which the size of the\nmatrices goes to infinity and the noncommutativity parameter goes to zero the\ndisc becomes sharper. We introduce a Laplacian defined on the whole algebra and\ncalculate its eigenvalues. We also calculate the two--points correlation\nfunction for a free massless theory (Green's function). In both cases the\nagreement with the exact result on the disc is very good already for relatively\nsmall matrices. This opens up the possibility for the study of field theories\non the disc with nonperturbative methods. The model contains edge states, a\nfact studied in a similar matrix model independently introduced by\nBalachandran, Gupta and Kurkcuoglu. \n\n"}

The\nsemiclassical limit of these flows is expressed through canonical differential\nforms of the spectral curve.
