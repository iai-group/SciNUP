We present new\ncertificates that are based on a combinatorial characterization for\nlocal-optimality of a codeword in irregular Tanner codes with respect to any\nMBIOS channel. This characterization is based on a conical combination of\nnormalized weighted subtrees in the computation trees of the Tanner graph.\nThese subtrees may have any finite height h (even equal or greater than half of\nthe girth of the Tanner graph). In addition, the degrees of local-code nodes in\nthese subtrees are not restricted to two. We prove that local optimality in\nthis new characterization implies maximum-likelihood (ML) optimality and LP\noptimality, and show that a certificate can be computed efficiently.\n  We also present a new message-passing iterative decoding algorithm, called\nnormalized weighted min-sum (NWMS). NWMS decoding is a BP-type algorithm that\napplies to any irregular binary Tanner code with single parity-check local\ncodes. We prove that if a locally-optimal codeword with respect to height\nparameter h exists (whereby notably h is not limited by the girth of the Tanner\ngraph), then NWMS decoding finds this codeword in h iterations. The decoding\nguarantee of the NWMS decoding algorithm applies whenever there exists a\nlocally optimal codeword. Because local optimality of a codeword implies that\nit is the unique ML codeword, the decoding guarantee also provides an ML\ncertificate for this codeword.\n  Finally, we apply the new local optimality characterization to regular Tanner\ncodes, and prove lower bounds on the noise thresholds of LP decoding in MBIOS\nchannels. When the noise is below these lower bounds, the probability that LP\ndecoding fails decays doubly exponentially in the girth of the Tanner graph. \n\n"}

However, although triplets determine or encode rooted\nphylogenetic trees, they do not in general encode rooted phylogenetic networks,\nwhich is a potential issue for any such method. Motivated by this fact, Huber\nand Moulton recently introduced trinets as a natural extension of rooted\ntriplets to networks.

It is desirable for m to be\nsmall, and for Phi to support fast matrix-vector multiplication.

We show that there exists a set of\nn vectors such that any such matrix A with at most s non-zero entries per\ncolumn must have s = Omega(eps^{-1}log n/log(1/eps)) as long as m <\nO(n/log(1/eps)). This bound improves the lower bound of Omega(min{eps^{-2},\neps^{-1}sqrt{log_m d}}) by [Dasgupta-Kumar-Sarlos, STOC 2010], which only held\nagainst the stronger property of distributional JL, and only against a certain\nrestricted class of distributions.

Our lower bound matches the sparse\nJohnson-Lindenstrauss upper bound of [Kane-Nelson, SODA 2012] up to an\nO(log(1/eps)) factor.\n  Next, we show that any m x n matrix with the k-restricted isometry property\n(RIP) with constant distortion must have at least Omega(klog(n/k)) non-zeroes\nper column if the number of the rows is the optimal value m = O(klog (n/k)),\nand if k < n/polylog n.

These stable superpolynomials are\nreadily mapped into bisymmetric polynomials, an operation that spoils the ring\nstructure but drastically simplifies the associated vector space. Our main\nresult is a factorization of the (stable) bisymmetric Macdonald polynomials,\ncalled double Macdonald polynomials and indexed by pairs of partitions, into a\nproduct of Macdonald polynomials (albeit subject to non-trivial plethystic\ntransformations). As an off-shoot, we note that, after multiplication by a\nt-Vandermonde determinant, this provides explicit formulas for a large class of\nMacdonald polynomials with prescribed symmetry. The factorization of the double\nMacdonald polynomials leads immediately to the generalization of basically\nevery elementary properties of the Macdonald polynomials to the double case\n(norm, kernel, duality, positivity, etc).

In many of these application domains the learner may be\nconstrained by one or more supply (or budget) limits, in addition to the\ncustomary limitation on the time horizon. The literature lacks a general model\nencompassing these sorts of problems. We introduce such a model, called\n\"bandits with knapsacks\", that combines aspects of stochastic integer\nprogramming with online learning. A distinctive feature of our problem, in\ncomparison to the existing regret-minimization literature, is that the optimal\npolicy for a given latent distribution may significantly outperform the policy\nthat plays the optimal fixed arm. Consequently, achieving sublinear regret in\nthe bandits-with-knapsacks problem is significantly more challenging than in\nconventional bandit problems.\n  We present two algorithms whose reward is close to the information-theoretic\noptimum: one is based on a novel \"balanced exploration\" paradigm, while the\nother is a primal-dual algorithm that uses multiplicative updates. Further, we\nprove that the regret achieved by both algorithms is optimal up to\npolylogarithmic factors.

It has been\nverified for conservative problems (also known as list homomorphism problems)\nby A. Bulatov (2003). We augment this result by showing that for digraph\ntemplates H, every conservative CSP, denoted LHOM(H), is solvable in logspace\nor is hard for NL. More precisely, we introduce a digraph structure we call a\ncircular N, and prove the following dichotomy: if H contains no circular N then\nLHOM(H) admits a logspace algorithm, and otherwise LHOM(H) is hard for NL. Our\nalgorithm operates by reducing the lists in a complex manner based on a novel\ndecomposition of an auxiliary digraph, combined with repeated applications of\nReingold's algorithm for undirected reachability (2005). We also prove an\nalgebraic version of this dichotomy: the digraphs without a circular N are\nprecisely those that admit a finite chain of polymorphisms satisfying the\nHagemann-Mitschke identities. This confirms a conjecture of Larose and Tesson\n(2007) for LHOM(H). Moreover, we show that the presence of a circular N can be\ndecided in time polynomial in the size of H. \n\n"}

This is a\ncentral notion in signal processing, statistics and machine learning. But in\napplications such as sparse coding, edge detection, compression and super\nresolution, the dictionary $A$ is unknown and has to be learned from random\nexamples of the form $Y = AX$ where $X$ is drawn from an appropriate\ndistribution --- this is the dictionary learning problem. In most settings, $A$\nis overcomplete: it has more columns than rows. This paper presents a\npolynomial-time algorithm for learning overcomplete dictionaries; the only\npreviously known algorithm with provable guarantees is the recent work of\nSpielman, Wang and Wright who gave an algorithm for the full-rank case, which\nis rarely the case in applications. Our algorithm applies to incoherent\ndictionaries which have been a central object of study since they were\nintroduced in seminal work of Donoho and Huo. In particular, a dictionary is\n$\\mu$-incoherent if each pair of columns has inner product at most $\\mu /\n\\sqrt{n}$.\n  The algorithm makes natural stochastic assumptions about the unknown sparse\nvector $X$, which can contain $k \\leq c \\min(\\sqrt{n}/\\mu \\log n, m^{1/2\n-\\eta})$ non-zero entries (for any $\\eta > 0$).

The work is\nmotivated by the recent work on one scan 1-bit compressed sensing (sparse\nsignal recovery) using $\\alpha$-stable random projections, which requires\nestimating of the scale parameter at bits-level. Our technique can be naturally\napplied to data stream computations for estimating the $\\alpha$-th frequency\nmoment. In fact, the method applies to the general scale family of\ndistributions, not limited to $\\alpha$-stable distributions.\n  Due to the heavy-tailed nature of $\\alpha$-stable distributions, using\ntraditional estimators will potentially need many bits to store each\nmeasurement in order to ensure sufficient accuracy. Interestingly, our paper\ndemonstrates that, using a simple closed-form estimator with merely 1-bit\ninformation does not result in a significant loss of accuracy if the parameter\nis chosen appropriately. For example, when $\\alpha=0+$, 1, and 2, the\ncoefficients of the optimal estimation variances using full (i.e.,\ninfinite-bit) information are 1, 2, and 2, respectively. With the 1-bit scheme\nand appropriately chosen parameters, the corresponding variance coefficients\nare 1.544, $\\pi^2/4$, and 3.066, respectively. Theoretical tail bounds are also\nprovided. Using 2 or more bits per measurements reduces the estimation variance\nand importantly, stabilizes the estimate so that the variance is not sensitive\nto parameters.

Our technique combines together random feature maps with\nrecent advances in matrix sketching, it has guaranteed spectral norm error\nbounds with respect to the original kernel matrix, and it compares favorably in\npractice to state-of-the-art approaches. \n\n"}

A traditional approach is to look for codes which\nsimultaneously maximize error tolerance and minimize storage space consumption.\nHowever, this tends to yield codes for which error correction requires an\nunrealistic amount of communication between storage nodes. LRCs solve this\nproblem by allowing errors to be corrected locally.\n  This thesis reviews previous results on the subject presented in [1]. These\ninclude that every almost affine LRC induces a matroid such that the essential\nproperties of the code are determined by the matroid. Also, the generalized\nSingleton bound for LRCs can be extended to matroids as well. Then, matroid\ntheory can be used to find classes of matroids that either achieve the bound,\nmeaning they are optimal in a certain sense, or at least come close to the\nbound.

Baik, Ben\nArous and P\\'ech\\'e showed that the spiked Wishart ensemble exhibits a sharp\nphase transition asymptotically: when the signal strength is above a critical\nthreshold, it is possible to detect the presence of a spike based on the top\neigenvalue, and below the threshold the top eigenvalue provides no information.\nSuch results form the basis of our understanding of when PCA can detect a\nlow-rank signal in the presence of noise.\n  However, not all the information about the spike is necessarily contained in\nthe spectrum. We study the fundamental limitations of statistical methods,\nincluding non-spectral ones. Our results include:\n  I) For the Gaussian Wigner ensemble, we show that PCA achieves the optimal\ndetection threshold for a variety of benign priors for the spike.

In this paper, we propose a\npreconditioning technique for accelerating the solution of the aforementioned\nlinear system.

A drawback to this approach is that the\nalgorithms are often explicitly built according to the stability assumption and\ngive no guarantees in the worst case; indeed, several recent algorithms output\narbitrarily bad solutions even when just a small section of the data does not\nsatisfy the given stability notion.\n  In this work, we address this concern in two ways.

Using the sketch and solve paradigm,\none first computes $S \\cdot A$ and $S \\cdot b$ for a randomly chosen matrix\n$S$, then outputs $x' = (SA)^{\\dagger} Sb$ so as to minimize $\\|SAx' - Sb\\|_2$.\n  The sketch-and-solve paradigm gives a bound on $\\|x'-x^*\\|_2$ when $A$ is\nwell-conditioned. Our main result is that, when $S$ is the subsampled\nrandomized Fourier/Hadamard transform, the error $x' - x^*$ behaves as if it\nlies in a \"random\" direction within this bound: for any fixed direction $a\\in\n\\mathbb{R}^d$, we have with $1 - d^{-c}$ probability that\n  \\[\n  \\langle a, x'-x^*\\rangle \\lesssim\n\\frac{\\|a\\|_2\\|x'-x^*\\|_2}{d^{\\frac{1}{2}-\\gamma}}, \\quad (1)\n  \\]\n  where $c, \\gamma > 0$ are arbitrary constants.\n  This implies $\\|x'-x^*\\|_{\\infty}$ is a factor $d^{\\frac{1}{2}-\\gamma}$\nsmaller than $\\|x'-x^*\\|_2$.

Abstract: Submodular functions are a broad class of set functions, which naturally\narise in diverse areas. Many algorithms have been suggested for the\nmaximization of these functions. Unfortunately, once the function deviates from\nsubmodularity, the known algorithms may perform arbitrarily poorly. Amending\nthis issue, by obtaining approximation results for set functions generalizing\nsubmodular functions, has been the focus of recent works.\n  One such class, known as weakly submodular functions, has received a lot of\nattention. A key result proved by Das and Kempe (2011) showed that the\napproximation ratio of the greedy algorithm for weakly submodular maximization\nsubject to a cardinality constraint degrades smoothly with the distance from\nsubmodularity. However, no results have been obtained for maximization subject\nto constraints beyond cardinality. In particular, it is not known whether the\ngreedy algorithm achieves any non-trivial approximation ratio for such\nconstraints.\n  In this paper, we prove that a randomized version of the greedy algorithm\n(previously used by Buchbinder et al. (2014) for a different problem) achieves\nan approximation ratio of $(1 + 1/\\gamma)^{-2}$ for the maximization of a\nweakly submodular function subject to a general matroid constraint, where\n$\\gamma$ is a parameter measuring the distance of the function from\nsubmodularity. Moreover, we also experimentally compare the performance of this\nversion of the greedy algorithm on real world problems against natural\nbenchmarks, and show that the algorithm we study performs well also in\npractice. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm with a\nnon-trivial approximation guarantee for maximizing a weakly submodular function\nsubject to a constraint other than the simple cardinality constraint. In\nparticular, it is the first algorithm with such a guarantee for the important\nand broad class of matroid constraints. \n\n"}

However, little is known\nabout that of the variable version LLL (variable-LLL) where events are\ngenerated by independent random variables, though this model of events is\napplicable to almost all applications of LLL. We introduce a necessary and\nsufficient criterion for variable-LLL, in terms of the probabilities of the\nevents and the event-variable graph specifying the dependency among the events.\nBased on this new criterion, we obtain boundaries for two families of\nevent-variable graphs, namely, cyclic and treelike bigraphs. These are the\nfirst two non-trivial cases where the variable-LLL boundary is fully\ndetermined. As a byproduct, we also provide a universal constructive method to\nfind a set of events whose union has the maximum probability, given the\nprobability vector and the event-variable graph. Though it is #P-hard in\ngeneral to determine variable-LLL boundaries, we can to some extent decide\nwhether a gap exists between a variable-LLL boundary and the corresponding\nabstract-LLL boundary.

We show that for a broad class of kernels, including the popular\nGaussian and polynomial kernels, computing a relative error $k$-rank\napproximation to $K$ is at least as difficult as multiplying the input data\nmatrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ by an arbitrary matrix $C \\in\n\\mathbb{R}^{d \\times k}$. Barring a breakthrough in fast matrix multiplication,\nwhen $k$ is not too large, this requires $\\Omega(nnz(A)k)$ time where $nnz(A)$\nis the number of non-zeros in $A$. This lower bound matches, in many parameter\nregimes, recent work on subquadratic time algorithms for low-rank approximation\nof general kernels [MM16,MW17], demonstrating that these algorithms are\nunlikely to be significantly improved, in particular to $O(nnz(A))$ input\nsparsity runtimes. At the same time there is hope: we show for the first time\nthat $O(nnz(A))$ time approximation is possible for general radial basis\nfunction kernels (e.g., the Gaussian kernel) for the closely related problem of\nlow-rank approximation of the kernelized dataset. \n\n"}

However, the perfomance analysis is often carried\nout under the abstract assumption that a truly random unit cost hash function\nis used, without concern for which concrete hash function is employed. The\nconcrete hash function may work fine on sufficiently random input. The question\nis if it can be trusted in the real world when faced with more structured\ninput.\n  In this paper we focus on two prominent applications of hashing, namely\nsimilarity estimation with the one permutation hashing (OPH) scheme of Li et\nal. [NIPS'12] and feature hashing (FH) of Weinberger et al. [ICML'09], both of\nwhich have found numerous applications, i.e. in approximate near-neighbour\nsearch with LSH and large-scale classification with SVM.\n  We consider mixed tabulation hashing of Dahlgaard et al.[FOCS'15] which was\nproved to perform like a truly random hash function in many applications,\nincluding OPH. Here we first show improved concentration bounds for FH with\ntruly random hashing and then argue that mixed tabulation performs similar for\nsparse input. Our main contribution, however, is an experimental comparison of\ndifferent hashing schemes when used inside FH, OPH, and LSH.\n  We find that mixed tabulation hashing is almost as fast as the\nmultiply-mod-prime scheme ax+b mod p. Mutiply-mod-prime is guaranteed to work\nwell on sufficiently random data, but we demonstrate that in the above\napplications, it can lead to bias and poor concentration on both real-world and\nsynthetic data. We also compare with the popular MurmurHash3, which has no\nproven guarantees. Mixed tabulation and MurmurHash3 both perform similar to\ntruly random hashing in our experiments. However, mixed tabulation is 40%\nfaster than MurmurHash3, and it has the proven guarantee of good performance on\nall possible input. \n\n"}

A convenient approach to study parallelization is through the\nprism of \\emph{adaptivity} which is an information theoretic measure of the\nparallel runtime of an algorithm [BS18]. Informally, adaptivity is the number\nof sequential rounds an algorithm needs to make when it can execute\npolynomially-many queries in parallel at every round. For combinatorial\noptimization with black-box oracle access, the study of adaptivity has recently\nled to exponential accelerations in parallel runtime and the natural question\nis whether dramatic accelerations are achievable for convex optimization.\n  For the problem of minimizing a non-smooth convex function $f:[0,1]^n\\to\n\\mathbb{R}$ over the unit Euclidean ball, we give a tight lower bound that\nshows that even when $\\texttt{poly}(n)$ queries can be executed in parallel,\nthere is no randomized algorithm with $\\tilde{o}(n^{1/3})$ rounds of adaptivity\nthat has convergence rate that is better than those achievable with a\none-query-per-round algorithm.

This is quite different from the\nclassical $q$-ary MDS codes where it is conjectured that the code length is\nupper bounded by $q+1$ (or $q+2$ for some special case). This discovery\ninspired some recent studies on length of an optimal locally recoverable code.\nIt was shown in \\cite{LXY} that a $q$-ary optimal locally recoverable code is\nunbounded for $d=3,4$. Soon after, it was proved that a $q$-ary optimal locally\nrecoverable code with distance $d$ and locality $r$ can have length\n$\\Omega_{d,r}(q^{1 + 1/\\lfloor(d-3)/2\\rfloor})$. Recently, an explicit\nconstruction of $q$-ary optimal locally recoverable codes for distance $d=5,6$\nwas given in \\cite{J18} and \\cite{BCGLP}.\n  In this paper, we further investigate construction optimal locally\nrecoverable codes along the line of using parity-check matrices.

On the other hand, many graph classes can be\nefficiently recognized by techniques based on some interesting orderings of the\nnodes, such as the ones given by traversals.\n  We study specifically graph classes that have an ordering avoiding some\nordered structures.

More broadly, any prior knowledge about\na signal's Fourier power spectrum can constrain its complexity. Intuitively,\nsignals with more highly constrained Fourier structure require fewer samples to\nreconstruct.\n  We formalize this intuition by showing that, roughly, a continuous signal\nfrom a given class can be approximately reconstructed using a number of samples\nproportional to the *statistical dimension* of the allowed power spectrum of\nthat class. Further, in nearly all settings, this natural measure tightly\ncharacterizes the sample complexity of signal reconstruction.\n  Surprisingly, we also show that, up to logarithmic factors, a universal\nnon-uniform sampling strategy can achieve this optimal complexity for *any\nclass of signals*. We present a simple and efficient algorithm for recovering a\nsignal from the samples taken. For bandlimited and sparse signals, our method\nmatches the state-of-the-art.

We study a natural experimental design objective, namely,\nD-optimality, that can be used to identify which $K$ pairwise comparisons to\ngenerate. This objective is known to perform well in practice, and is\nsubmodular, making the selection approximable via the greedy algorithm.

The centralized coded caching framework,\nconsists of a caching phase and a delivery phase, both of which are carefully\ndesigned in order to use the cache and the channel together optimally. In prior\nliterature, various combinatorial structures have been used to construct coded\ncaching schemes. In this work, we propose a binary matrix model to construct\nthe coded caching scheme. The ones in such a \\textit{caching matrix} indicate\nuncached subfiles at the users. Identity submatrices of the caching matrix\nrepresent transmissions in the delivery phase. Using this model, we then\npropose several novel constructions for coded caching based on the various\ntypes of combinatorial designs.

We prove that the generalized permutation\npatterns $(13-2)$ and $(2-31)$ are invariant under the action and use this to\nprove unimodality properties for a $q$-analog of the Eulerian numbers recently\nstudied by Corteel, Postnikov, Steingr\\'{\\i}msson and Williams.\n  We also extend the action to linear extensions of sign-graded posets to give\na new proof of the unimodality of the $(P,\\omega)$-Eulerian polynomials of\nsign-graded posets and a combinatorial interpretations (in terms of\nStembridge's peak polynomials) of the corresponding coefficients when expanded\nin the above basis.\n  Finally, we prove that the statistic defined as the number of vertices of\neven height in the unordered decreasing tree of a permutation has the same\ndistribution as the number of descents on any set of permutations invariant\nunder the action.

{"id": "math/0701633", "contents": "Title: Area distribution and scaling function for punctured polygons Abstract: Punctured polygons are polygons with internal holes which are also polygons.\nThe external and internal polygons are of the same type, and they are mutually\nas well as self-avoiding. Based on an assumption about the limiting area\ndistribution for unpunctured polygons, we rigorously analyse the effect of a\nfinite number of punctures on the limiting area distribution in a uniform\nensemble, where punctured polygons with equal perimeter have the same\nprobability of occurrence. Our analysis leads to conjectures about the scaling\nbehaviour of the models.\n  We also analyse exact enumeration data. For staircase polygons with punctures\nof fixed size, this yields explicit expressions for the generating functions of\nthe first few area moments. For staircase polygons with punctures of arbitrary\nsize, a careful numerical analysis yields very accurate estimates for the area\nmoments. Interestingly, we find that the leading correction term for each area\nmoment is proportional to the corresponding area moment with one less puncture.\nWe finally analyse corresponding quantities for punctured self-avoiding\npolygons and find agreement with the conjectured formulas to at least 3-4\nsignificant digits. \n\n"}
{"id": "math/0702515", "contents": "Title: The Neighbor-Net Algorithm Abstract: The neighbor-joining algorithm is a popular phylogenetics method for\nconstructing trees from dissimilarity maps. The neighbor-net algorithm is an\nextension of the neighbor-joining algorithm and is used for constructing split\nnetworks. We begin by describing the output of neighbor-net in terms of the\ntessellation of $\\bar{\\MM}_{0}^n(\\mathbb{R})$ by associahedra. This highlights\nthe fact that neighbor-net outputs a tree in addition to a circular ordering\nand we explain when the neighbor-net tree is the neighbor-joining tree. A key\nobservation is that the tree constructed in existing implementations of\nneighbor-net is not a neighbor-joining tree. Next, we show that neighbor-net is\na greedy algorithm for finding circular split systems of minimal balanced\nlength. This leads to an interpretation of neighbor-net as a greedy algorithm\nfor the traveling salesman problem. The algorithm is optimal for Kalmanson\nmatrices, from which it follows that neighbor-net is consistent and has optimal\nradius 1/2. We also provide a statistical interpretation for the balanced\nlength for a circular split system as the length based on weighted least\nsquares estimates of the splits. We conclude with applications of these results\nand demonstrate the implications of our theorems for a recently published\ncomparison of Papuan and Austronesian languages. \n\n"}

{"id": "math/9912047", "contents": "Title: Combinatorial Properties of the Family of Maximum Stable Sets of a Graph Abstract: The stability number alpha(G) of a graph G is the cardinality of a maximum\nstable set in G, xi(G) denotes the size of core(G), where core(G) is the\nintersection of all maximum stable sets of G. In this paper we prove that for a\ngraph G without isolated vertices, the following assertions are true: (i) if\nxi(G)< 2, then G is quasi-regularizable; (ii) if G is of order n and alpha(G) >\n(n+k-1)/2, for some k > 0, then xi(G) > k, and xi(G) > k+1, whenever n+k-1 is\neven. The last finding is a strengthening of a result of Hammer, Hansen, and\nSimeone, which states that alpha(G) > n/2 implies xi(G) > 0. G is a\nKoenig-Egervary graph if n equals the sum of its stability number and the\ncardinality of a maximum matching. For Koenig-Egervary graphs, we prove that\nalpha(G) > n/2 holds if and only if xi(G) is greater than the size of the\nneighborhood of core(G). Moreover, for bipartite graphs without isolated\nvertices, alpha(G) > n/2 is equivalent to xi(G) > 1. We also show that Hall's\nmarriage Theorem is valid for Koenig-Egervary graphs, and it is sufficient to\ncheck Hall's condition only for one specific stable set, namely, for core(G). \n\n"}
