Although the deviation of Omega_0\nfrom unity is small by the observational bound, we argue that the effect of\nthis small deviation on the large angle CMB anisotropies can be significant for\ntensor-type perturbation in open inflation scenario. We consider the situation\nin which there is a large hierarchy between the energy scale of the quantum\ntunneling and that of the slow-roll inflation in the nucleated bubble. If the\npotential just after tunneling is steep enough, a rapid-roll phase appears\nbefore the slow-roll inflation. In this case the power spectrum is basically\ndetermined by the Hubble rate during the slow-roll inflation. If such\nrapid-roll phase is absent, the power spectrum keeps the memory of the high\nenergy density there in the large angular components. The amplitude of large\nangular components can be enhanced due to the effects of the wall fluctuation\nmode if the bubble wall tension is small.

It is well known that modular\ninvariance fixes strong constraints that in some cases appear only at higher\ngenus. Here we classify all the Weyl and modular invariant partition functions\ngiven by the path integral on the world-sheet metric, together with space-time\ncoordinates, b-c and/or beta-gamma systems, that correspond to volume forms on\nM_g. This was a long standing question, advocated by Belavin and Knizhnik,\ninspired by the Serre GAGA principle and based on the properties of the Mumford\nforms. The key observation is that the Bergman reproducing kernel provides a\nWeyl and modular invariant way to remove the point dependence that appears in\nthe above string determinants, a property that should have its superanalog\nbased on the super Bergman reproducing kernel. This is strictly related to the\nproperties of the propagator associated to the space-time coordinates.

The K-theory groups in question are the home of interesting\nindex invariants and secondary invariants, in particular the rho-class in\nK_*(D*G) of a metric of positive scalar curvature on a spin manifold.\n  One of our main results is the construction of a map from the Stolz exact\nsequence to the Higson-Roe exact sequence (commuting with all arrows), using\ncoarse index theory throughout.\n  Our main tool are two index theorems, which we believe to be of independent\ninterest. The first is an index theorem of Atiyah-Patodi-Singer type. Here,\nassume that Y is a compact spin manifold with boundary, with a Riemannian\nmetric g which is of positive scalar curvature when restricted to the boundary\n(and with fundamental group G). Because the Dirac operator on the boundary is\ninvertible, one constructs a delocalized APS-index in K_* (D*G). We then show\nthat this class equals the rho-class of the boundary.\n  The second theorem equates a partitioned manifold rho-class of a positive\nscalar curvature metric to the rho-class of the partitioning hypersurface. \n\n"}

To determine the full scope of possible low energy theories\nwith abelian gauge factors, which allow for an F-theory realization, it is\ncentral to obtain a comprehensive list of all singular elliptic fibrations with\nextra sections.

In consequence, we observe that either the lapse is\ntrivial and $(M,g)$ is Poincar\\'e-Einstein or the Wang mass is negative, as in\nthe case of time symmetric slices of the AdS soliton.

Because\nthe quantum relaxation dynamics is independent of the direction of the wave\nvector for the relaxing field mode, in the limit of weak anisotropy we are able\nto derive an expression for the anisotropic power spectrum that is determined\nby the power deficit function. As a result, the off-diagonal terms in the CMB\ncovariance matrix are also determined by the power deficit. We show that the\nlowest-order l-(l+1) inter-multipole correlations have a characteristic scaling\nwith multipole moment l. Our derived spectrum also predicts a residual\nstatistical anisotropy at small scales, with an approximate consistency\nrelation between the scaling of the l-(l+1) correlations and the scaling of the\nangular power spectrum at high l. We also predict a relationship between the\nl-(l+1) correlations at large and small scales. Cosmological quantum relaxation\nappears to provide a single physical mechanism that predicts both a large-scale\npower deficit and a range of statistical anisotropies, together with\npotentially testable relationships between them. \n\n"}

We call this\nscenario the LXCDM model. One possibility for X would be a scalar field, but it\nis not the only one. The overall equation of state (EOS) of the LXCDM model can\neffectively appear as quintessence or phantom energy depending on the mixture\nof the two components. Both the dynamics of Lambda and of X could be linked to\nhigh energy effects near the Planck scale. In the case of Lambda it may be\nrelated to the running of this parameter under quantum effects, whereas X might\nbe identified with some fundamental field (say, a dilaton) left over as a\nlow-energy ``relic'' by e.g. string theory.

The quantum dynamics of AQG is governed by a\nsingle Master Constraint operator. While AQG is inspired by Loop Quantum\nGravity (LQG), it differs drastically from it because in AQG there is\nfundamentally no topology or differential structure. A natural Hilbert space\nrepresentation acquires the structure of an infinite tensor product (ITP) whose\nseparable strong equivalence class Hilbert subspaces (sectors) are left\ninvariant by the quantum dynamics. The missing information about the topology\nand differential structure of the spacetime manifold as well as about the\nbackground metric to be approximated is supplied by coherent states.

It seems that a geometric\ninterpretation of this mechanism-the cancellation of local and global fermion\nanomalies against local and global anomalies in the electric coupling of an\nabelian gauge field-always proceeds in a similar manner. For example, a\nprevious paper with M. Hopkins (hep-th/0002027) explains the cancellation of\nanomalies in Type II with D-branes in these terms.

The presence of\na fundamental scale suggests that local Lorentz invariance may be violated at\nsufficiently high energies. Motivated by this possibility, recently, different\nmodels that violate Lorentz invariance locally have been used to evaluate the\ntrans-Planckian corrections to the inflationary density perturbation spectrum.\nHowever, certain astrophysical observations seem to indicate that local Lorentz\ninvariance may be preserved to extremely high energies. In such a situation, to\nstudy the trans-Planckian effects, it becomes imperative to consider models\nthat preserve local Lorentz invariance even as they contain a fundamental\nscale. In this work, we construct one such model and evaluate the resulting\nspectrum of density perturbations in the power-law inflationary scenario. While\nour model reproduces the standard spectrum on small scales, it naturally\npredicts a suppression of power on large scales. In fact, the spectrum we\nobtain has some features which are similar to the one that has recently been\nobtained from non-commutative inflation. However, we find that the amount of\nsuppression predicted by our model is far less than that is required to fit the\nobservations.

For M-theory compactified on a Joyce manifold $M^7$, the fact\nthat $M^7$ is constructed via a generalized Kummer construction on a 7-torus\n${\\smallBbb T}^7$ with a torsion-free $G_2$-structure $\\phi$ suggests that\nthere are natural fibrations of $M^7$ by ${\\smallBbb T}^3$, ${\\smallBbb T}^4$,\nand K3 surfaces in a way governed by $\\phi$. The local picture of some of these\nfibrations and their roles in dualities between string/M-theory have been\nstudied intensively in the work of Acharya. In this present work, we explain\nhow one can understand their global and topological details in terms of bundles\nover orbifolds. After the essential background is provided in Sec. 1, we give\ngeneral discussions in Sec. 2 about these fibrations, their generic and\nexceptional fibers, their monodromy, and the base orbifolds.

This model\nis different from usual non-commutative ones because the x-y coordinates are\nquantized, while the z coordinate is not.\n  One of new and interesting points in our non-commutative model is that the\nstrings corresponding to Dirac ones in the Berry model exist only in states\ncontaining the ground state (${\\cal F}\\times \\{\\ket{0}\\} \\cup \\{\\ket{0}\\}\\times\n{\\cal F}$), while for other excited states (${\\cal F}\\times {\\cal F} \\setminus\n{\\cal F}\\times \\{\\ket{0}\\} \\cup \\{\\ket{0}\\}\\times {\\cal F}$) they don't exist.\n  It is probable that a non-commutative model makes singular objects (singular\npoints or singular lines or etc) in the corresponding classical model mild or\nremoves them partly. \n\n"}
{"id": "quant-ph/0605123", "contents": "Title: Exact Solutions of a Non-Polynomially Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation Abstract: A nonlinear generalisation of Schrodinger's equation had previously been\nobtained using information-theoretic arguments. The nonlinearities in that\nequation were of a nonpolynomial form, equivalent to the occurence of\nhigher-derivative nonlinear terms at all orders. Here we construct some exact\nsolutions to that equation in 1+1 dimensions. On the half-line, the solutions\nresemble exponentially damped Bloch waves even though no external periodic\npotential is included: the periodicity is induced by the nonpolynomiality. The\nsolutions are nonperturbative as they do not reduce to solutions of the linear\ntheory in the limit that the nonlinearity parameter vanishes. An intriguing\nfeature of the solutions is their infinite degeneracy: for a given energy,\nthere exists a very large arbitrariness in the normalisable wavefunctions. We\nalso consider solutions to a q-deformed version of the nonlinear equation and\ndiscuss a natural discretisation implied by the nonpolynomiality. Finally, we\ncontrast the properties of our solutions with other solutions of nonlinear\nSchrodinger equations in the literature and suggest some possible applications\nof our results in the domains of low-energy and high-energy physics. \n\n"}

Then, without appealing to the wave function\nproperties, we reproduce the well-known dispersion relations which predict the\nband structure for the energy spectrum in the Kr\\\"onig-Penney model. \n\n"}

There\nevolution is governed via (a kind of) a parallel transport in this bundle. Some\nproblems concerning observables are considered.

Relativistic invariance Abstract: If several interventions performed on a quantum system are localized in\nmutually space-like regions, they will be recorded as a sequence of ``quantum\njumps'' in one Lorentz frame, and as a different sequence of jumps in another\nLorentz frame. Conditions are specified that must be obeyed by the various\noperators involved in the calculations so that these two different sequences\nlead to the same observable results. These conditions are similar to the\nequal-time commutation relations in quantum field theory. They are sufficient\nto prevent superluminal signaling. (The derivation of these results does not\nrequire most of the contents of the preceding article. What is needed is\nbriefly summarized here, so that the present article is essentially\nself-contained.) \n\n"}
