Then the variance of the interface height w.r.t. the Gibbs\nmeasure stays bounded uniformly in the volume for any positive pinning force\nand diverges like the logarithm of the pinning force when it tends to zero.\n  How does the presence of a quenched disorder term in the Hamiltonian modify\nthis transition?

The proof is based on a rigorous lower bound for the overlap\nbetween local magnetizations and random fields in finite volume.

At the static\nphase-transition for Ising, the dynamics is conjectured to undergo a critical\nslowdown: At high temperature the inverse-gap is O(1), at the critical\n$\\beta_c$ it is polynomial in the side-length and at low temperature it is\nexponential in it.

The limit\nprocess is given by the jumps of a certain alpha-stable subordinator at the\ninverse of another alpha-stable subordinator, correlated with the first\nsubordinator. For that result, the requirements for the embedded random walk\nare a) the validity of a law of large numbers for its range, and b) the slow\nvariation at infinity of the tail of the distribution of its time of return to\nthe origin: they include all transient random walks as well as all planar\nrandom walks, and also many one dimensional random walks.

In the case of $C^0$ and $C^1$-convergence, we achieve this by\ncoupling two particles. To get $C^2$-convergence (in particular, convergence of\nthe curvature), we use a coupling of three particles. This triple coupling is\ndeveloped here only for the case of constant curvature metrics on surfaces,\nthough we suspect that some variants of this idea are applicable in other\nsituations and therefore be of independent interest. Finally, for $k\\ge3$, the\n$C^k$-convergence follows relatively easily using induction and coupling of two\nparticles. None of these techniques appear in the Ricci flow literature and\nthus provide an alternative approach to the field. \n\n"}

It is well known\nthat this model exhibits a phase transition at a critical value of the\ninteraction strength parameter K, in the limit of the number N of rotators\ngoing to infinity. A Fokker-Planck PDE captures the evolution of the empirical\nmeasure of the system as N goes to infinity, at least for finite times and when\nthe empirical measure of the system at time zero satisfies a law of large\nnumbers. The phase transition is reflected in the fact that the PDE for K above\nthe critical value has a stable manifold of stationary solutions, that are\nequivalent up to rotations. These stationary solutions are actually unimodal\ndensities parametrized by the position of their maximum (the synchronization\nphase or center). We characterize the dynamics on times of order N and we show\nsubstantial deviations from the behavior of the solutions of the PDE. In fact,\nif the empirical measure at time zero converges as N goes to infinity to a\nprobability measure (which is away from a thin set that we characterize) and if\ntime is speeded up by N, the empirical measure reaches almost instantaneously a\nsmall neighborhood of the stable manifold, to which it then sticks and on which\na non-trivial random dynamics takes place. In fact the synchronization center\nperforms a Brownian motion with a diffusion coefficient that we compute. Our\napproach therefore provides, for one of the basic statistical mechanics systems\nwith continuum symmetry, a detailed characterization of the macroscopic\ndeviations from the large scale limit -- or law of large numbers -- due to\nfinite size effects. But the interest for this model goes beyond statistical\nmechanics, since it plays a central role in a variety of scientific domains in\nwhich one aims at understanding synchronization phenomena. \n\n"}

We focus\non the stationary distribution of a multidimensional semimartingale reflecting\nBrownian motion (SRBM) on a nonnegative orthant. An SRBM is uniquely determined\n(in distribution) by its data that consists of a covariance matrix, a drift\nvector, and a reflection matrix. Assume that the stationary distribution of an\nSRBM exists. We first characterize two marginal distributions under the\ndecomposability assumption. We prove that they are the stationary distributions\nof some lower dimensional SRBMs. We also identify the data for these lower\ndimensional SRBMs. Thus, under the decomposability assumption, we can obtain\nthe stationary distribution of the original SRBM by computing those of the\nlower dimensional ones. However, this characterization of the marginal\ndistributions is not sufficient for the decomposability. So, we next consider\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for the decomposability.

The main results can be split into three parts. The\nresults of the first part guarantee that each \"unit distance graph\" in the\nplane has an induced subgraph with chromatic number at most 4 that covers at\nleast 91.7 percent of the vertices of the whole graph.\n  The results of the second and third parts are related to the standard model\nof a random graph with n labeled vertices in which the edges occur\nindependently with probability p, where p is a function of n. This is known as\nthe Erdos--Renyi model G(n,p). Given a monotone property of a graph, Erdos and\nRenyi's theorem (1960) states that there exists a critical threshold value of\np(n) below which the probability that a random graph has that property tends to\none (as n tends to infinity) and above which the probability tends to zero.\n  The main results of the second part are concerned with the (monotone)\nproperty of a graph to be isomorphic to some unit-distance graph in Euclidean\nd-space with fixed dimension d. The results of this part guarantee that for d\nin {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}, the threshold value of p(n) is big-Theta of 1/n.\nFurthermore, the case d = 1 stands apart from the case of higher dimensions;\nhere the threshold probability is big-Theta of 1/(n^(4/3)).\n  The results of the third part are devoted to studying \"graphs of diameters\"\nfrom the probabilistic standpoint. In particular, it is shown that under some\nconditions, almost all graphs of diameters in the plane have chromatic number\nless than 3.

The scheme preserves two important structural properties\nof the equation: the first is the interpretation as a gradient flow in a mass\ntransportation metric, and the second is an intimate relation to a linear\nFokker-Planck equation.

Using this\ndiffusion model, we obtain the steady-state distributions of virtual waiting\ntime and queue length, which in turn yield simple formulas for performance\nmeasures such as the service level and the effective abandonment fraction.\nThese formulas are generally accurate when the mean patience time is several\ntimes longer than the mean service time and the patience time distribution does\nnot change rapidly around the mean virtual waiting time. For practical\npurposes, these formulas outperform existing results that rely on the\nexponential service time assumption.\n  To justify the diffusion model, we formulate an asymptotic framework by\nconsidering a sequence of queues, in which both the number of servers and the\nmean patience time go to infinity.

In addition to simulating quantum systems, SQA has also been\nproposed as another physics-inspired classical algorithm for combinatorial\noptimization, alongside classical simulated annealing. However, in many cases\nit remains an open challenge to determine the performance of both QA and SQA.\nOne piece of evidence for the strength of QA over classical simulated annealing\ncomes from an example by Farhi, Goldstone and Gutmann . There a bit-symmetric\ncost function with a thin, high energy barrier was designed to show an\nexponential seperation between classical simulated annealing, for which thermal\nfluctuations take exponential time to climb the barrier, and quantum annealing\nwhich passes through the barrier and reaches the global minimum in poly time,\narguably by taking advantage of quantum tunneling. In this work we apply a\ncomparison method to rigorously show that the Markov chain underlying SQA\nefficiently samples the target distribution and finds the global minimum of\nthis spike cost function in polynomial time. Our work provides evidence for the\ngrowing consensus that SQA inherits at least some of the advantages of\ntunneling in QA, and so QA is unlikely to achieve exponential speedups over\nclassical computing solely by the use of quantum tunneling. Since we analyze\nonly a particular model this evidence is not decisive. However, techniques\napplied here---including warm starts from the adiabatic path and the use of the\nquantum ground state probability distribution to understand the stationary\ndistribution of SQA---may be valuable for future studies of the performance of\nSQA on cost functions for which QA is efficient. \n\n"}

The main idea is to construct an exploration process starting\nfrom the boundary of the domain, to discover the Ising loops and to establish\nits convergence to a conformally invariant limit. The challenge is that Ising\nloops do not touch the boundary; we use the fact that FK loops touch the\nboundary (and hence can be explored from the boundary) and that Ising loops in\nturn touch FK loops, to construct a recursive exploration process that visits\nall the macroscopic loops.\n  A key ingredient in the proof is the convergence of Ising free arcs to the\nFree Arc Ensemble (FAE), established in [BDH16].

The SGDCT algorithm follows a (noisy) descent direction along a\ncontinuous stream of data. SGDCT performs an online parameter update in\ncontinuous time, with the parameter updates $\\theta_t$ satisfying a stochastic\ndifferential equation. We prove that $\\lim_{t \\rightarrow \\infty} \\nabla \\bar\ng(\\theta_t) = 0$ where $\\bar g$ is a natural objective function for the\nestimation of the continuous-time dynamics. The convergence proof leverages\nergodicity by using an appropriate Poisson equation to help describe the\nevolution of the parameters for large times.

For certain\ncontinuous-time problems, SGDCT has some promising advantages compared to a\ntraditional stochastic gradient descent algorithm.

In this paper we consider the No Restart Random Walk (NRRW) model\nwhere a walker builds its graph (tree) while moving around. In particular, the\nwalker takes s steps (a parameter) on the current graph. A new node with degree\none is added to the graph and connected to the node currently occupied by the\nwalker. The walker then resumes, taking another s steps, and the process\nrepeats. We analyze this process from the perspective of the walker and the\nnetwork, showing a fundamental dichotomy between transience and recurrence for\nthe walker as well as power law and exponential degree distribution for the\nnetwork. More precisely, we prove the following results: i) for s=1 the random\nwalk is transient and the degree of every node is bounded from above by a\ngeometric distribution. ii) for s even the random walk is recurrent and the\ndegree of non-leaf nodes is bounded from below by a power law distribution with\nexponent decreasing in s. We also provide a lower bound for the fraction of\nleaves in the graph, and for s=2 our bound implies that the fraction of leaves\ngoes to one as the graph size goes to infinity.

After some random amount of time\n{\\em all the balls} of any urn are redistributed locally, among the $h_N$ urns\nof its neighborhood.

This elementary identity\nillustrates a general moment formula for $P$-means in terms of the partition\nstructure associated with random samples from $P$, first developed by Diaconis\nand Kemperman (1996) and Kerov (1998) in terms of random permutations. As shown\nby Tsilevich (1997) if the partition probabilities factorize in a way\ncharacteristic of the generalized Ewens sampling formula with two parameters\n$(\\alpha,\\theta)$, found by Pitman (1992), then the moment formula yields the\nCauchy-Stieltjes transform of an $(\\alpha,\\theta)$ mean.

Our approach\nis to interpret them as probability distributions on a space of point\nconfigurations, i.e., as certain point stochastic processes, and to find the\ncorrelation functions of these processes.\n  In the present paper we relate the correlation functions to the solutions of\ncertain multidimensional moment problems.

{"id": "math/9904022", "contents": "Title: Scaling limits of loop-erased random walks and uniform spanning trees Abstract: The uniform spanning tree (UST) and the loop-erased random walk (LERW) are\nrelated probabilistic processes. We consider the limits of these models on a\nfine grid in the plane, as the mesh goes to zero. Although the existence of\nscaling limits is still unproven, subsequential scaling limits can be defined\nin various ways, and do exist. We establish some basic a.s. properties of the\nsubsequential scaling limits in the plane. It is proved that any LERW\nsubsequential scaling limit is a simple path, and that the trunk of any UST\nsubsequential scaling limit is a topological tree, which is dense in the plane.\n  The scaling limits of these processes are conjectured to be conformally\ninvariant in 2 dimensions. We make a precise statement of the conformal\ninvariance conjecture for the LERW, and show that this conjecture implies an\nexplicit construction of the scaling limit, as follows. Consider the Loewner\ndifferential equation\n  ${\\partial f\\over\\partial t}\n  = z {\\zeta(t)+z \\over \\zeta(t)-z} {\\partial f\\over\\partial z}$\n  with boundary values $f(z,0)=z$, in the range $z\\in\\U=\\{w\\in\\C\\st |w|<1\\}$,\n$t\\le 0$.
