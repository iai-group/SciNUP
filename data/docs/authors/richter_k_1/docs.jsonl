At the\nsame time, for NLSMs describing metal-insulator transitions of Anderson\nlocalization in electronic conductors, the strong RG-relevance of these\noperators has been previously related to statistical properties of the\nconductance of samples of large finite size (\"conductance fluctuations\").

When the\ncorresponding multiphoton Rabi oscillations are underdamped, zero temperature\nquantum fluctuations determine comparable populations of all quasienergy states\nwhich belong to a resonant multiphoton doublet. Most interestingly, the quantum\nfluctuations probe the multiphoton transitions by inducing several peaks in the\nnoise spectrum of the resonator observables. In particular, the noise of the\nphoton number contains complete information about the multiphoton states and\ntheir stationary populations via pairs of nearly symmetric peaks at opposite\nfrequencies. Their widths are determined by the damping of the Rabi\noscillations and their heights are proportional to the stationary nonequilbrium\npopulations. A finite detuning from a multiphoton resonance generates a\nquasielastic noise peak at zero frequency. In addition, we relate the\nstationary populations of the quasienergy states with an effective quantum\ntemperature and discuss the role of a finite temperature. \n\n"}

Although apparently simple in its scope, the study of ionic dynamics\nin confined geometries has revealed interesting new phenomena that have an\nalmost one-to-one correspondence with the quantum regime. The picture that\nemerges is that ions can form two `quasi-particle' states, one in which they\nsurround themselves with other ions of opposite charge - ionic atmosphere - and\none in which semi-bound water molecules form layers at different distances from\nthe ions - hydration layers. The second state gives rise to two additional\neffects. In the first, which is a single quasi-particle effect, the ionic\nconductance through a nanopore is predicted to be `quantized' as a function of\npore radius, with the corresponding `quantization units' not related to\nuniversal constants - like the Plank constant and the elementary charge - but\nrather to the radii of the hydration layers. The second effect instead involves\nthe many-body interaction among ionic quasi-particles of the same sign, and\noccurs when the pore has a finite capacitance to accommodate ions so that there\nis a threshold concentration beyond which ions of the same sign are not\nenergetically allowed to enter the pore.

We first answer these claims---explaining\nwhy the first is based on a definition of \"a priori knowledge\" so strange that,\nwere it adopted, almost no quantum algorithm could be distinguished from a pure\nrandom-number source; while the second is neither new nor a practical obstacle\nto interesting BosonSampling experiments. However, we then go further, and\naddress some interesting research questions inspired by Gogolin et al.'s\nmistaken arguments. We prove that, with high probability over a Haar-random\nmatrix A, the BosonSampling distribution induced by A is far from the uniform\ndistribution in total variation distance. More surprisingly, and directly\ncounter to Gogolin et al., we give an efficient algorithm that distinguishes\nthese two distributions with constant bias.

In this paper, using analytic arguments and numerical\nsimulations, we study the behaviour of local observables in an isolated MBL\nsystem following a quantum quench. For the case of a global quench, we find\nthat the local observables reach stationary, highly non-thermal values at long\ntimes as a result of slow dephasing characteristic of the MBL phase. These\nstationary values retain the local memory of the initial state due to the\nexistence of local integrals of motion in the MBL phase. The temporal\nfluctuations around stationary values exhibit universal power-law decay in\ntime, with an exponent set by the localization length and the diagonal entropy\nof the initial state. Such a power-law decay holds for any local observable and\nis related to the logarithmic in time growth of entanglement in the MBL phase.\nThis behaviour distinguishes the MBL phase from both the Anderson insulator\n(where no stationary state is reached), and from the ergodic phase (where\nrelaxation is expected to be exponential). For the case of a local quench, we\nalso find a power-law approach of local observables to their stationary values\nwhen the system is prepared in a mixed state. Quench protocols considered in\nthis paper can be naturally implemented in systems of ultra cold atoms in\ndisordered optical lattices, and the behaviour of local observables provides a\ndirect experimental signature of many-body localization. \n\n"}

This machine is a nanoscale analogue of a\nconventional thermocouple heat-engine, in which the active region being heated\nis unavoidably also exchanging heat with its cold environment. Heat exchange\nbetween the dot and the thermal reservoirs is treated as a capacitive coupling\nto electronic fluctuations in localized levels, modeled as two additional\nquantum dots. The resulting multiple-dot setup is described using a master\nequation approach. We observe an \"exotic\" power generation, which remains\nfinite even when the heat absorbed from the thermal reservoirs is zero (in\nother words the heat coming from the hot reservoir all escapes into the cold\nenvironment). This effect can be understood in terms of a non-local effect in\nwhich the heat flow from heat source to the cold environment generates power\nvia a mechanism which we refer to as Coulomb heat drag.

Our approach uses the ratio of the mean free path to the\ncharacteristic system lengthscale, also known as the Knudsen number, as the\nexpansion parameter to study the effects of boundaries on the breakdown of the\nFourier descrition. We show that, in the bulk, the traditional heat conduction\nequation using Fourier's law as a constitutive relation is valid at least up to\nsecond order in the Knudsen number for steady problems and first order for\ntime-dependent problems. However, this description does not hold within\ndistances on the order of a few mean free paths from the boundary; this\nbreakdown is a result of kinetic effects that are always present in the\nboundary vicinity and require solution of a Boltzmann boundary-layer problem to\nbe determined. Matching the inner, boundary layer, solution to the outer, bulk,\nsolution yields boundary conditions for the Fourier description as well as\nadditive corrections in the form of universal kinetic boundary layers; both are\nfound to be proportional to the bulk-solution gradients at the boundary and\nparametrized by the material model and the phonon-boundary interaction model\n(Boltzmann boundary condition).

As evidenced by our micromagnetic simulations,\nskyrmions can hardly be driven by either a static electric field or a static\nmagnetic field alone. Although the magnetic anisotropy can be modified by an\nelectric field, parametric pumping with an oscillating electric field can only\nexcite the breathing modes. On the other hand, a static magnetic field can\nbreak rotational symmetry through the Zeeman interaction, but it cannot serve\nas an energy source for propelling a skyrmion. Here we found that the\ncombination of a perpendicularly oscillating electric field and an in-plane\nstatic magnetic field can drive a skyrmion undergoing a wiggling motion along a\nwell defined trajectory. The most efficient driving occurs when the frequency\nof the oscillating field is close to that of the breathing motion.

At higher drives the\nmoving skyrmion lattice regains full ordering. For increasing pinning strength,\nwe find a transition from elastic to plastic depinning that is accompanied by a\nsharp increase in the depinning threshold due to the proliferation of\ntopological defects, similar to the peak effect found at the elastic to plastic\ndepinning transition in superconducting vortex systems. For strong pinning and\nstrong Magnus force, the skyrmions in the moving phase can form a strongly\nclustered or phase separated state with highly modulated skyrmion density,\nsimilar to that recently observed in continuum-based simulations for strong\ndisorder. As the Magnus force is decreased, the density phase separated state\ncrosses over to a dynamically phase separated state with uniform density but\nwith flow localized in bands of motion, while in the strongly damped limit,\nboth types of phase separated states are lost.

This unusual Hall effect is not expected in\nnonmagnetc materials such as PtTe$_2$, and has been observed previously mostly\nin magnetic semiconductors or metals. Remarkably, the PHE in PtTe$_2$ can be\nobserved up to temperatures near room temperature which indicates the\nrobustness of the effect. This is in contrast to the chiral anomaly induced\nnegative longitudnal magnetoresistance (LMR), which can be observed only in the\nlow temperature regime and is sensitive to extrinsic effects, such as current\njetting and chemical inhomogeneities in crystals of high mobility. Planar Hall\neffect on the other hand is a purely intrinsic effect generated by the Berry\ncurvature in Weyl semimetals. Additionally, the PHE is observed for PtTe$_2$\neven though the Dirac node is $\\approx 0.8$~eV away from the Fermi level.

In practice, information processing takes place in finite\ntime, resulting in dissipation and potentially unreliable logical outcomes. For\noverdamped Langevin dynamics, we show that counterdiabatic potentials can be\ncrafted to guide systems rapidly and accurately along desired computational\npaths, providing shortcuts that allows for the precise design of finite-time\ncomputations. Such shortcuts require additional work, beyond Landauer's bound,\nthat is irretrievably dissipated into the environment.

We first classify higher-order Dirac models according to the\ntime-reversal, particle-hole, and chiral symmetries, and determine the\neven-oddness of the order of band crossing in each symmetry class. The\neven-oddness further constrains the rotational symmetry $m$ permitted in a\nsymmetry class. Expressing the topological invariant in terms of a momentum\nspace integration over a curvature function, the order of band crossing\ndetermines the critical exponent of the curvature function, as well as that of\nthe Wannier state correlation function introduced through the Fourier transform\nof the curvature function.

However, the\nstorage capacity of the entire network then decreases. To overcome this\ndifficulty, we propose decreasing the connecting rate while keeping the total\nnumber of synapses constant by introducing delayed synapses. In this paper, a\ndiscrete synchronous-type model with both delayed synapses and their prunings\nis discussed as a concrete example of the proposal. First, we explain the\nYanai-Kim theory by employing the statistical neurodynamics. This theory\ninvolves macrodynamical equations for the dynamics of a network with serial\ndelay elements. Next, considering the translational symmetry of the explained\nequations, we re-derive macroscopic steady state equations of the model by\nusing the discrete Fourier transformation. The storage capacities are analyzed\nquantitatively. Furthermore, two types of synaptic prunings are treated\nanalytically: random pruning and systematic pruning. As a result, it becomes\nclear that in both prunings, the storage capacity increases as the length of\ndelay increases and the connecting rate of the synapses decreases when the\ntotal number of synapses is constant. Moreover, an interesting fact becomes\nclear: the storage capacity asymptotically approaches $2/\\pi$ due to random\npruning. In contrast, the storage capacity diverges in proportion to the\nlogarithm of the length of delay by systematic pruning and the proportion\nconstant is $4/\\pi$.

The model\nallows to analyze tunnelling both from bulk-like contacts and from 2D\naccumulation layers. The fine features in the I-V characteristics due to the\nquantum dot states are known to be shifted to different voltages depending upon\nthe value of the magnetic field. While this effect is also well reproduced by\nour calculations, in this work we concentrate on the amplitude of each current\nresonance as a function of the magnetic field. Such amplitudes show\noscillations reflecting the variation of the density of states at the Fermi\nenergy in the emitter. Furthermore the amplitude increases as a function of the\nmagnetic field for certain features while it decreases for others. In\nparticular we demonstrate that the behaviour of the amplitude of the current\nresonances is linked to the value of the angular momentum of each dot level\nthrough which tunnelling occurs. We show that a selection rule on the angular\nmomentum must be satisfied. As a consequence, tunnelling through specific dot\nstates is strongly suppresses and sometimes prohibited altogether by the\npresence of the magnetic field.

Thus, it also serves as a quantification of irreversibility in\nquantum mechanics.\n  In this thesis the LE is studied in systems that have a classical counterpart\nwith dynamical instability, that is, classically chaotic. An analytical\ntreatment that makes use of the semiclassical approximation is presented. It is\nshown that, under certain regime of the parameters, the LE decays\nexponentially. Furthermore, for strong enough perturbations, the decay rate is\ngiven by the Lyapunov exponent of the classical system.
