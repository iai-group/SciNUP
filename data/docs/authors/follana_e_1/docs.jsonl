Abstract: This paper explores whether Eguchi-Kawai reduction for gauge theories with\nadjoint fermions is valid. The Eguchi-Kawai reduction relates gauge theories in\ndifferent numbers of dimensions in the large $N$ limit provided that certain\nconditions are met. In principle, this relation opens up the possibility of\nlearning about the dynamics of 4D gauge theories through techniques only\navailable in lower dimensions. Dimensional reduction can be understood as a\nspecial case of large $N$ equivalence between theories related by an orbifold\nprojection. In this work, we focus on the simplest case of dimensional\nreduction, relating a 4D gauge theory to a 3D gauge theory via an orbifold\nprojection. A necessary condition for the large N equivalence between the 4D\nand 3D theories to hold is that certain discrete symmetries in the two theories\nmust not be broken spontaneously. In pure 4D Yang-Mills theory, these\nsymmetries break spontaneously as the size of one of the spacetime dimensions\nshrinks. An analysis of the effect of adjoint fermions on the relevant\nsymmetries of the 4D theory shows that the fermions help stabilize the\nsymmetries. We consider the same problem from the point of view of the lower\ndimensional 3D theory and find that, surprisingly, adjoint fermions are not\ngenerally enough to stabilize the necessary symmetries of the 3D theory. In\nfact, a rich phase diagram arises, with a complicated pattern of symmetry\nbreaking. We discuss the possible causes and consequences of this finding. \n\n"}

In particular, we examine the\nextent to which these ensembles capture topological and confinement properties\nof the Yang-Mills vacuum. This further allows us to test the classic picture of\nmeron-induced quark confinement as triggered by dimeron dissociation. At small\nbare couplings, spacial, topological-charge and color correlations among the\ndimerons generate a short-range order which screens topological charges. With\nincreasing coupling this order weakens rapidly, however, in part because the\ndimerons gradually dissociate into their meron constituents. Monitoring\nconfinement properties by evaluating Wilson-loop expectation values, we find\nthe growing disorder due to these progressively liberated merons to generate a\nfinite and (with the coupling) increasing string tension. The short-distance\nbehavior of the static quark-antiquark potential, on the other hand, is\ndominated by small, \"instanton-like\" dimerons. String tension, action density\nand topological susceptibility of the dimeron ensembles in the physical\ncoupling region turn out to be of the order of standard values. Hence the above\nresults demonstrate without reliance on weak-coupling or low-density\napproximations that the dissociating dimeron component in the Yang-Mills vacuum\ncan indeed produce a meron-populated confining phase. The density of\ncoexisting, hardly dissociated and thus instanton-like dimerons seems to remain\nlarge enough, on the other hand, to reproduce much of the additional\nphenomenology successfully accounted for by non-confining instanton vacuum\nmodels. Hence dimeron ensembles should provide an efficient basis for a rather\ncomplete description of the Yang-Mills vacuum. \n\n"}

As the number of\nflavors is varied the gauge theory may be confining, walking or conformal. The\ntoy model mimicking this feature is the two dimensional O(3) sigma model with a\ntheta-term. For all theta the model is asymptotically free. For small theta the\nmodel is confining in the infra red, for theta = pi the model has a non-trivial\ninfra red fixed point and consequently for theta slightly below pi the coupling\nwalks. The first step in investigating the notoriously difficult systematic\neffects of the gauge theory in the toy model is to establish non-perturbatively\nthat the theta parameter is actually a relevant coupling.

However, dynamical mechanism\nleading to breakdown of chiral symmetry should be naturally reflected in chiral\nproperties of the modes. Here we offer such connection, presenting evidence\nthat SChSB in QCD proceeds via the appearance of modes exhibiting dynamical\ntendency for local chiral polarization. These modes form a band of finite width\nLambda_ch (chiral polarization scale) around the surface of otherwise\nanti--polarized Dirac sea, and condense. Lambda_ch characterizes the dynamics\nof the breaking phenomenon and can be converted to a quark mass scale, thus\noffering conceptual means to determine which quarks of nature are governed by\nbroken chiral dynamics. It is proposed that, within the context of SU(3) gauge\ntheories with fundamental Dirac quarks, mode condensation is equivalent to\nchiral polarization. This makes Lambda_ch an \"order parameter\" of SChSB, albeit\nwithout local dynamical field representation away from chiral limit. Several\nuses of these features, both at zero and finite temperature, are discussed. Our\ninitial estimates are Lambda_ch~150 MeV (N_f=0), Lambda_ch~80 MeV (N_f=2+1,\nphysical point), and that the strange quark is too heavy to be crucially\ninfluenced by broken chiral symmetry. \n\n"}

Accordingly, we need only examine the large\namplitude variation of a single QED fermion determinant. To facilitate this the\nSchwinger proper time representation of this determinant is decomposed into a\nsum of three terms. The advantage of this is that the separate terms can be\nnon-perturbatively estimated for a measurable class of large amplitude random\nfields in four dimensions.

Loop currents and charge ordering are driven by\ndistinct components of the short-range Coulomb interactions: loop currents\nresult from the repulsion between nearest-neighbor copper and oxygen orbitals,\nwhile charge order results from repulsion between neighboring oxygen orbitals.\nWe find that the leading piLC phase has an antiferromagnetic pattern similar to\npreviously discovered staggered flux phases, and that it emerges abruptly at\nhole dopings p below the van Hove filling.

The low-lying\nentanglement spectrum displays clear features as the strength of the coupling\nis varied, such as eigenvalue crossing, a sharp change in the Schmidt gap, and\nscale invariance at unitarity. Beyond the low-lying component, the spectrum\nappears as a quasi-continuum distribution, for which we present a statistical\ncharacterization; we find, in particular, that the mean shifts to infinity as\nthe coupling is turned off, which indicates that that part of the spectrum\nrepresents non-perturbative contributions to the entanglement Hamiltonian. In\ncontrast, the low-lying entanglement spectrum evolves to finite values in the\nnoninteracting limit. The scale invariance of the unitary regime guarantees\nthat our results are universal features intrinsic to 3D quantum mechanics and\nrepresent a well-defined prediction for ultracold atom experiments, which were\nrecently shown to have direct access to the entanglement entropy. \n\n"}

An explanation of how and where the Roper\nresonance fits into the emerging spectrum of hadrons cannot rest on a\ndescription of its mass alone. Instead, it must combine this with a detailed\nunderstanding of the Roper's structure and how that is revealed in the\ntransition form factors. Furthermore, it must unify all this with a similarly\ncomplete picture of the proton. This is a prodigious task, but a ten-year\ninternational effort, drawing together experimentalists and theorists, has\npresented a solution to the puzzle. Namely, the Roper is at heart the proton's\nfirst radial excitation, consisting of a dressed-quark core augmented by a\nmeson cloud that reduces the core mass by approximately 20% and materially\nalters its electroproduction form factors on $Q^2<2m_N^2$, where $m_N$ is the\nproton's mass. We describe the experimental motivations and developments which\nenabled electroproduction data to be procured within a domain that is\nunambiguously the purview of sQCD, thereby providing a real challenge and\nopportunity for modern theory; and survey the developments in reaction models\nand QCD theory that have enabled this conclusion to be drawn about the nature\nof the Roper resonance. \n\n"}

Using a lattice QCD data of the\nchiral condensate at a finite temperature as our training data, the deep\nlearning procedure holographically determines an emergent bulk metric as neural\nnetwork weights. The emergent bulk metric is found to have both a black hole\nhorizon and a finite-height IR wall, so shares both the confining and\ndeconfining phases, signaling the cross-over thermal phase transition of QCD.\nIn fact, a quark antiquark potential holographically calculated by the emergent\nbulk metric turns out to possess both the linear confining part and the Debye\nscreening part, as is often observed in lattice QCD.

The search for such a state was motivated by the recent\ndiscovery by the BaBar Collaboration of a narrow state at 2.32 GeV, the\nDsJ*(2317)+ that decays to Ds+pi0. Reconstructing the Ds+pi0 and Ds*+pi0 final\nstates in CLEO data, we observe peaks in both of the corresponding\nreconstructed mass difference distributions, dM(Dspi0)=M(Dspi0)-M(Ds) and\ndM(Ds*pi0)=M(Ds*pi0)-M(Ds*), both of them at values near 350 MeV. We interpret\nthese peaks as signatures of two distinct states, the DsJ*(2317)+ plus a new\nstate, designated as the DsJ(2463)+. Because of the similar dM values, each of\nthese states represents a source of background for the other if photons are\nlost, ignored or added.

Other classes of DSE models\ncharacterised by qualitatively different interactions also exhibit a mean field\ntransition. Incipient in this observation is the suggestion that mean field\nexponents are a result of the gap equation's fermion substructure and not of\nthe interaction. \n\n"}
{"id": "nucl-th/9907086", "contents": "Title: Diquarks: condensation without bound states Abstract: We employ a bispinor gap equation to study superfluidity at nonzero chemical\npotential: mu .neq. 0, in two- and three-colour QCD. The two-colour theory,\nQC2D, is an excellent exemplar: the order of truncation of the quark-quark\nscattering kernel: K, has no qualitative impact, which allows a straightforward\nelucidation of the effects of mu when the coupling is strong. In rainbow-ladder\ntruncation, diquark bound states appear in the spectrum of the three-colour\ntheory, a defect that is eliminated by an improvement of K. The corrected gap\nequation describes a superfluid phase that is semi-quantitatively similar to\nthat obtained using the rainbow truncation. A model study suggests that the\nwidth of the superfluid gap and the transition point in QC2D provide reliable\nquantitative estimates of those quantities in QCD. \n\n"}

This study is\ndone both in the framework of the Serre presentation and in the $R$-matrix\nscheme of Faddeev, Reshetikhin and Takhtajan (FRT). We show that there exists\nan infinite number of Casimir operators, indexed by integers $p > 1$ in the\nundeformed case and by $p \\in Z$ in the deformed case, which obey quadratic\nrelations. The construction of the dual superalgebra of functions on\n$SL_{qs}(1|2)$ is also given and higher tensor product representations are\ndiscussed. Finally, we construct quantum chain Hamiltonians based on the\nCasimir operators. In the deformed case we find two Hamiltonians which describe\ndeformed $t-J$ models. \n\n"}
{"id": "q-alg/9709040", "contents": "Title: Deformation quantization of Poisson manifolds, I Abstract: I prove that every finite-dimensional Poisson manifold X admits a canonical\ndeformation quantization. Informally, it means that the set of equivalence\nclasses of associative algebras close to the algebra of functions on X is in\none-to-one correspondence with the set of equivalence classes of Poisson\nstructures on X modulo diffeomorphisms. In fact, a more general statement is\nproven (\"Formality conjecture\"), relating the Lie superalgebra of polyvector\nfields on X and the Hochschild complex of the algebra of functions on X.\nCoefficients in explicit formulas for the deformed product can be interpreted\nas correlators in a topological open string theory, although I do not use\nexplicitly the language of functional integrals. One of corollaries is a\njustification of the orbit method in the representation theory. \n\n"}
