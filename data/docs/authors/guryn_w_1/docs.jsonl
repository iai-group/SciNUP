The study of the propagation of light through an\nexternal field can also be used to probe for new physics such as the existence\nof axion-like particles and millicharged particles. Their existence in nature\nwould cause the index of refraction of vacuum to be different from unity in the\npresence of an external field and dependent of the polarization direction of\nthe light propagating.

This has led\nnaturally to proposals that a correct approach is to instead use a type of\n\"generalized\" transverse momentum dependent factorization in which the basic\nfactorized structure is assumed to remain valid, but with transverse momentum\ndependent parton distribution functions that contain non-standard, process\ndependent Wilson line structures.

Since a proof of generalized transverse\nmomentum dependent factorization should apply generally to any hard\nhadro-production process, a single counter-example suffices to show that a\ngeneral proof does not exist.

Color transparency onsets when the\ntime of formation of the charmonium wave function becomes longer than the\ninter-nucleon spacing. In this energy regime the effective break-up cross\nsection for a c-cbar dipole depends on energy and nuclear path length, and\nagrees well with data from fixed target experiments, both in magnitude and\nenergy dependence. At higher energies of RHIC and LHC coherence in c-cbar pair\nproduction leads to charm quark shadowing which is a complement to the high\ntwist break up cross section. These two effects explain well with no adjusted\nparameters the magnitude and rapidity dependence of nuclear suppression of\nJ/Psi observed at RHIC in dAu collisions, while the contribution of leading\ntwist gluon shadowing is found to be vanishingly small. A novel mechanism of\ndouble color filtering for c-cbar dipoles makes nuclei significantly more\ntransparent in AA compared to pA collisions.

Due to its\nshort lifetime, many QGP properties can only be inferred indirectly through a\ncomparison of the final state measurements with transport model calculations.\nAmong the current phenomena of interest are the interdependencies between two\ncollective flow phenomena, elliptic and triangular flow. The former is mostly\nrelated to the initial geometry and collective expansion of the system whereas\nthe latter is sensitive to the fluctuations of the initial state.

Notably, fluctuations of strength of the initial Glauber sources\nwhich yield the observed distribution of hadron multiplicities and, at the same\ntime, lead to correct values of the elliptic flow coefficients both from the\ntwo- and four-particle cumulant method, as measured by the ATLAS collaboration.\nThe azimuthally asymmetric flow is not modified significantly when changing the\nviscosity coefficient, the initial time for the collective expansion, or the\ninitial size of the fireball. The results present an estimate of the collective\ncomponent in the two-particle correlations measured experimentally.

Its accurate determination\nhas significant ramifications in understanding not only the reaction dynamics\nof heavy-ion reactions especially those induced by radioactive beams but also\nmany interesting phenomena in astrophysics, such as the explosion mechanism of\nsupernova and the properties of neutron stars. The heavy-ion physics community\nhas devoted much effort during the last few years to constrain the high-density\nsymmetry using various probes. In particular, the pion-/pion+ ratio has been\nmost extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally. All models have\nconsistently predicted qualitatively that the pion-/pion+ ratio is a sensitive\nprobe of the high-density symmetry energy especially with beam energies near\nthe pion production threshold. However, the predicted values of the pion-/pion+\nratio are still quite model dependent mostly because of the complexity of\nmodeling pion production and reabsorption dynamics in heavy-ion collisions,\nleading to currently still controversial conclusions regarding the high-density\nbehavior of nuclear symmetry energy from comparing various model calculations\nwith available experimental data.

Comparisons are made to measurements from the\nlarger Pb-Pb system, where such evidence is established. In particular, the\nsecond harmonic two-particle cumulants are found to decrease with multiplicity,\ncharacteristic of a dominance of few-particle correlations in p-Pb collisions.\nHowever, when a $|\\Delta \\eta|$ gap is placed to suppress such correlations,\nthe two-particle cumulants begin to rise at high-multiplicity, indicating the\npresence of global azimuthal correlations. The Pb-Pb values are higher than the\np-Pb values at similar multiplicities. In both systems, the second harmonic\nfour-particle cumulants exhibit a transition from positive to negative values\nwhen the multiplicity increases.

Purpose: A relativistic energy density functional\n(EDF) is developed to address the complexity of such diverse nuclear systems.\nMoreover, a statistical perspective is adopted to describe the information\ncontent of various physical observables. Methods: We implement the model\noptimization by minimizing a suitably constructed chi-square objective function\nusing various properties of finite nuclei and neutron stars. The minimization\nis then supplemented by a covariance analysis that includes both uncertainty\nestimates and correlation coefficients. Results: A new model, FSUGold2, is\ncreated that can well reproduce the ground-state properties of finite nuclei,\ntheir monopole response, and that accounts for the maximum neutron star mass\nobserved up to date. In particular, the model predicts both a stiff symmetry\nenergy and a soft equation of state for symmetric nuclear matter--suggesting a\nfairly large neutron-skin thickness in Pb208 and a moderate value of the\nnuclear incompressibility. Conclusions: We conclude that without any meaningful\nconstraint on the isovector sector, relativistic EDFs will continue to predict\nsignificantly large neutron skins.

These degeneracies cannot be broken by the CMB constraint on the\neffective number of neutrinos, N_eff. However, since big bang nucleosynthesis\n(BBN) is also affected by a light WIMP and equivalent neutrinos, complementary\nBBN and CMB constraints can break some of the degeneracy. In a previous paper\nBBN and CMB were combined to explore allowed ranges for m_chi, Delta N_nu, and\nN_eff for light WIMPs that annihilate electromagnetically (EM) to photons\nand/or electrons/positrons. In this paper BBN predictions with a light WIMP\nthat only couples to neutrinos are calculated. Recent observed abundances of\n^2H and ^4He are used to limit m_chi, Delta N_nu, N_eff, and the present-day\nbaryon density. Allowing for a neutrino coupled light WIMP and nonzero Delta\nN_nu, combined BBN and CMB data give lower limits to m_chi, with a best fit\nm_chi > 35 MeV, equivalent to no light WIMP at all. All masses below 4--9 MeV\n(depending on spin) are excluded. Without any light WIMP, BBN alone prefers\nDelta N_nu = 0.50 +- 0.23, favoring neither Delta N_nu = 0, nor a fully\nthermalized sterile neutrino (Delta N_nu = 1).

We show that,\nbecause of the quenching of the energy of partons within a jet, even when\n$K\\neq 0$ the jets that survive with some specified energy in the final state\nare narrower than jets with that energy in proton-proton collisions. For this\nreason, many standard observables are rather insensitive to $K$. We propose a\nnew differential jet shape ratio observable in which the effects of transverse\nmomentum broadening are apparent. We also analyze the response of the medium to\nthe passage of the jet through it, noting that the momentum lost by the jet\nappears as the momentum of a wake in the medium. After freezeout this wake\nbecomes soft particles with a broad angular distribution but with net momentum\nin the jet direction. We show that the particles coming from the response of\nthe medium to the momentum and energy deposited in it leads to a correlation\nbetween the momentum of soft particles well separated from the jet in angle\nwith the direction of the jet momentum, and find qualitative but not\nquantitative agreement with experimental data on observables designed to\nextract such a correlation. By confronting the results that we obtain upon\nintroducing transverse momentum broadening and the response of the medium to\nthe jet with available jet data, we highlight the importance of these processes\nfor understanding the internal, soft, angular structure of high energy jets. \n\n"}

In these measurements pseudorapidity ($\\Delta\\eta$) and\nazimuthal ($\\Delta\\varphi$) differences are used to extract the shape of the\nnear-side peak formed by particles associated to a higher $p_{\\mathrm{T}}$\ntrigger particle ($1 < p_{\\mathrm{T, trig}} <$ 8 GeV/c). A combined fit of the\nnear-side peak and long-range correlations is applied to the data allowing the\nextraction of the centrality evolution of the peak shape in Pb-Pb collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 2.76 TeV. A significant broadening of the peak in\nthe $\\Delta\\eta$ direction at low $p_{\\mathrm{T}}$ is found from peripheral to\ncentral collisions, which vanishes above 4 GeV/c, while in the $\\Delta\\varphi$\ndirection the peak is almost independent of centrality.

The results are compared to pp\ncollisions at the same centre of mass energy and to AMPT model simulations.

It is well known, however, that\nthe quenching of jets from their interaction with the medium leads to a\nmigration of jets from higher to lower $p_T$, making it challenging to directly\ninfer the degree and mechanism of jet energy loss. Our proposed quantile\nmatching procedure is inspired by (but not reliant on) the approximate\nmonotonicity of energy loss in the jet $p_T$. In this strategy, jets in\nheavy-ion collisions ordered by $p_T$ are viewed as modified versions of the\nsame number of highest-energy jets in proton-proton collisions, and the\nfractional energy loss as a function of jet $p_T$ is a natural observable\n($Q_{\\rm AA}$).
