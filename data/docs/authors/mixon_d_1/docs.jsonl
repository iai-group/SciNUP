The main concern of this work is to design relaying\nstrategies that utilize efficiently the relays in such a way that the diversity\nis maximized. In part I, we focus on the amplify-and-forward (AF) strategy with\nwhich the relays simply scale the received signal and retransmit it. More\nspecifically, we characterize the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) of the\nAF scheme in a general multihop channel with arbitrary number of antennas and\narbitrary number of hops. The DMT is in closed-form expression as a function of\nthe number of antennas at each node. First, we provide some basic results on\nthe DMT of the general Rayleigh product channels. It turns out that these\nresults have very simple and intuitive interpretation. Then, the results are\napplied to the AF multihop channels which is shown to be equivalent to the\nRayleigh product channel, in the DMT sense. Finally, the project-and-forward\n(PF) scheme, a variant of the AF scheme, is proposed. We show that the PF\nscheme has the same DMT as the AF scheme, while the PF can have significant\npower gain over the AF scheme in some cases. In part II, we will derive the\nupper bound on the diversity of the multihop channels and show that it can be\nachieved by partitioning the multihop channel into AF subchannels. \n\n"}

This is partly a\nreview paper as it covers and expands on the mathematical framework underlying\na series of more applied articles. In addition, this article also presents a\nfew key new theorems that make the treatment self-contained. Stochastic\nprocesses with continuous time and continuous space variables are defined\nconstructively by establishing new convergence estimates for Markov chains on\nsimplicial sequences. We emphasize high precision computability by numerical\nlinear algebra methods as opposed to the ability of arriving to analytically\nclosed form expressions in terms of special functions.

Systems with non-zero gate times (``long gates'') are included in our\nanalysis by using an upper bound on the noise.

This model is motivated by wireless\ncommunications, where individual secure messages are broadcast over open media\nand can be received by any illegitimate receiver. The secrecy level is measured\nby equivocation rate at the eavesdropper. We first study the general\n(non-degraded) broadcast channel with confidential messages. We present an\ninner bound on the secrecy capacity region for this model. The inner bound\ncoding scheme is based on a combination of random binning and the\nGelfand-Pinsker bining. This scheme matches the Marton's inner bound on the\nbroadcast channel without confidentiality constraint. We further study the\nsituation where the channels are degraded.

This field addresses a broad range of problems of significant\npractical interest, namely, the recovery of a data matrix from what appears to\nbe incomplete, and perhaps even corrupted, information. In its simplest form,\nthe problem is to recover a matrix from a small sample of its entries, and\ncomes up in many areas of science and engineering including collaborative\nfiltering, machine learning, control, remote sensing, and computer vision to\nname a few.\n  This paper surveys the novel literature on matrix completion, which shows\nthat under some suitable conditions, one can recover an unknown low-rank matrix\nfrom a nearly minimal set of entries by solving a simple convex optimization\nproblem, namely, nuclear-norm minimization subject to data constraints.\nFurther, this paper introduces novel results showing that matrix completion is\nprovably accurate even when the few observed entries are corrupted with a small\namount of noise. A typical result is that one can recover an unknown n x n\nmatrix of low rank r from just about nr log^2 n noisy samples with an error\nwhich is proportional to the noise level. We present numerical results which\ncomplement our quantitative analysis and show that, in practice, nuclear norm\nminimization accurately fills in the many missing entries of large low-rank\nmatrices from just a few noisy samples.

The capacity region of this network when the relay\nis operating at either full-duplex mode or half-duplex mode for arbitrary\nnumber of pairs is characterized.

However, this incurs a\nlarge aggregate feedback bandwidth which grows linearly with the number of\nusers. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme to reduce the feedback load in\na downlink orthogonal space division multiple access (SDMA) system with\nzero-forcing receivers by allowing the users to dynamically determine the\nnumber of feedback bits to use according to multiple decision thresholds.\nThrough theoretical analysis, we show that, while keeping the aggregate\nfeedback load of the entire system constant regardless of the number of users,\nthe proposed scheme almost achieves the optimal asymptotic sum rate scaling\nwith respect to the number of users (also known as the multiuser diversity).\nSpecifically, given the number of thresholds, the proposed scheme can achieve a\nconstant portion of the optimal sum rate achievable only by the system where\nall the users always feedback, and the remaining portion (referred to as the\nsum rate loss) decreases exponentially to zero as the number of thresholds\nincreases. By deriving a tight upper bound for the sum rate loss, the minimum\nnumber of thresholds for a given tolerable sum rate loss is determined. In\naddition, a fast bit allocation method is discussed for the proposed scheme,\nand the simulation results show that the sum rate performances with the complex\noptimal bit allocation method and with the fast algorithm are almost the same.\nWe compare our multi-threshold scheme to some previously proposed feedback\nschemes. Through simulation, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme can reduce\nthe feedback load and utilize the limited feedback bandwidth more effectively\nthan the existing feedback methods. \n\n"}

Such task is\naccomplished by quantum authentication protocols which are distributed\nalgorithms based on the intrinsic properties of Quantum Mechanics. The choice\nof an authentication protocol must consider that quantum states are very\ndelicate and that the channel is subject to eavesdropping. However, even in\nface of the various existing definitions of quantum authentication protocols in\nthe literature, little is known about them in this perspective, and this lack\nof knowledge may unfavor comparisons and wise choices. In the attempt to\novercome this limitation, in the present work we aim at showing an approach to\nevaluate quantum authentication protocols based on the determination of their\nquantum communication complexity. Based on our investigation, no similar\nmethods to analyze quantum authentication protocols were found in the\nliterature. Pursuing this further, our approach has advantages that need to be\nhighlighted: it characterizes a systematic procedure to evaluate quantum\nauthentication protocols; its evaluation is intuitive, based only on the\nprotocol execution; the resulting measure is a concise notation of what\nresources a quantum authentication protocol demands and how many communications\nare performed; it allows comparisons between protocols; it makes possible to\nanalyze the communication effort when an eavesdropping occurs; and, lastly, it\nis likely to be applied in almost any quantum authentication protocol.

The\nobjective is to minimize the expected per-symbol distortion. For a fixed finite\nlookahead d>=1 we invoke the theory of controlled markov chains to obtain an\naverage cost optimality equation (ACOE), the solution of which, denoted by\nD(d), is the minimum expected per-symbol distortion. With increasing d, D(d)\nbridges the gap between causal encoding, d=0, where symbol by symbol\nencoding-decoding is optimal and the infinite lookahead case, d=\\infty, where\nShannon Theoretic arguments show that separation is optimal.

Three design criteria are\nconsidered to optimize the relay filter. The first criterion is the\nminimization of the relay transmit power subject to per-subcarrier\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) constraints, the second is the maximization of the\nworst subcarrier channel SNR subject to source and relay transmit power\nconstraints, and the third is the maximization of data rate subject to source\nand relay transmit power constraints.

An\nimportant member in this family is called \"a zone diagram\".

Coordinated resource allocation is the\nkey to efficient performance, but the demand on backhaul signaling and\ncomputational resources grows rapidly with number of cells, terminals, and\nsubcarriers. To handle this, we propose a novel multicell framework with\ndynamic cooperation clusters where each terminal is jointly served by a small\nset of base stations. Each base station coordinates interference to neighboring\nterminals only, thus limiting backhaul signalling and making the framework\nscalable. This framework can describe anything from interference channels to\nideal joint multicell transmission.\n  The resource allocation (i.e., precoding and scheduling) is formulated as an\noptimization problem (P1) with performance described by arbitrary monotonic\nfunctions of the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratios (SINRs) and arbitrary\nlinear power constraints. Although (P1) is non-convex and difficult to solve\noptimally, we are able to prove: 1) Optimality of single-stream beamforming; 2)\nConditions for full power usage; and 3) A precoding parametrization based on a\nfew parameters between zero and one.

The converse is based on utilizing the delay\nconstraint to amplify a local outage event associated with a message, globally\nacross all the coherence blocks. This approach appears to be new. We propose\ntwo coding schemes that achieve the optimal DMT. The first scheme involves\ninterleaving of messages, such that each message is transmitted across $T$\nconsecutive coherence blocks.

This result shows that, upon availability of asymmetric output feedback\nand delayed CSIT, there is no performance loss in terms of sum SDoF due to the\ndistributed nature of the transmitters. Next, we show that this result also\nholds if only output feedback is conveyed to the transmitters, but in a\nsymmetric manner, i.e., each receiver feeds back its output to both\ntransmitters and no CSIT. We also study the case in which only asymmetric\noutput feedback is provided to the transmitters, i.e., without CSIT, and derive\na lower bound on the sum SDoF for this model. Furthermore, we specialize our\nresults to the case in which there are no security constraints. In particular,\nsimilar to the setting with security constraints, we show that the optimal sum\nDoF region of the (M,M,N,N)--MIMO X-channel with asymmetric output feedback and\ndelayed CSIT is same as the DoF region of a two-user MIMO BC with 2M-antennas\nat the transmitter, N-antennas at each receiver, and delayed CSIT.

We study operator\nrealizations of the adjacency algebras of schemes and derive simple properties\nof these algebras. To develop a theory of general association schemes, we focus\non schemes on topological Abelian groups where we can employ duality theory and\nthe machinery of harmonic analysis. We construct translation association\nschemes on such groups using the language of spectrally dual partitions. Such\npartitions are shown to arise naturally on topological zero-dimensional Abelian\ngroups, for instance, Cantor-type groups or the groups of p-adic numbers. This\nenables us to construct large classes of dual pairs of association schemes on\nzero-dimensional groups with respect to their Haar measure, and to compute\ntheir eigenvalues and intersection numbers. We also derive properties of\ninfinite metric schemes, connecting them with the properties of the\nnon-Archimedean metric on the group.\n  Pursuing the connection between schemes on zero-dimensional groups and\nharmonic analysis, we show that the eigenvalues have a natural interpretation\nin terms of Littlewood-Paley wavelet bases, and in the (equivalent) language of\nmartingale theory.

Our\nparticular attention is on real-valued functions that can be represented as a\npost-processed sum of pre-processed sensor readings.

Abstract: This paper considers a general energy harvesting cooperative network with M\nsource-destination (SD) pairs and one relay, where the relay schedules only m\nuser pairs for transmissions. For the special case of m = 1, the addressed\nscheduling problem is equivalent to relay selection for the scenario with one\nSD pair and M relays. In conventional cooperative networks, the max-min\nselection criterion has been recognized as a diversity-optimal strategy for\nrelay selection and user scheduling. The main contribution of this paper is to\nshow that the use of the max-min criterion will result in loss of diversity\ngains in energy harvesting cooperative networks. Particularly when only a\nsingle user is scheduled, analytical results are developed to demonstrate that\nthe diversity gain achieved by the max-min criterion is only (M+1)/2, much less\nthan the maximal diversity gain M. The max-min criterion suffers this diversity\nloss because it does not reflect the fact that the source-relay channels are\nmore important than the relay-destination channels in energy harvesting\nnetworks. Motivated by this fact, a few user scheduling approaches tailored to\nenergy harvesting networks are developed and their performance is analyzed.\nSimulation results are provided to demonstrate the accuracy of the developed\nanalytical results and facilitate the performance comparison. \n\n"}

The small carrier\nwavelengths at mmwave frequencies enable synthesis of compact antenna arrays,\nproviding beamforming gains that compensate the increased propagation losses.\nIn this work, we investigate the feasibility of employing multiple antenna\narrays to obtain diversity/multiplexing gains in mmwave systems, where each of\nthe arrays is capable of beamforming independently. Considering a codebook\nbased beamforming system (e.g., to facilitate limited feedback), we observe\nthat the complexity of \\emph{jointly} optimizing the beamforming directions\nacross the multiple arrays is highly prohibitive, even for very reasonable\nsystem parameters. To overcome this bottleneck, we develop reduced complexity\nalgorithms for optimizing the choice of beamforming directions, premised on the\nsparse multipath structure of the mmwave channel. Specifically, we reduce the\ncardinality of the joint beamforming search space, by restricting attention to\na small set of dominant candidate directions. To obtain the set of dominant\ndirections, we develop two complementary approaches: (a) based on computation\nof a novel spatial power metric; a detailed analysis of this metric shows that,\nin the limit of large antenna arrays, the selected candidate directions\napproach the channel's dominant angles of arrival and departure, and (b)\nprecise estimation of the channel's (long-term) dominant angles of arrival,\nexploiting the correlations of the signals received across the different\nreceiver subarrays.

In particular, it is\nshown that the investigation of adaptive signal recovery algorithms needs\ncompletely new analytic tools since the methods used for non-adaptive\nreconstruction procedures, which are based on the celebrated Banach-Steinhaus\ntheorem, are not applicable in the adaptive case. The second part analyzes the\napproximation of the output of stable linear time-invariant (LTI) systems based\non samples of the input signal, and where the input is assumed to belong to the\nPaley-Wiener space of bandlimited functions with absolute integrable Fourier\ntransform. If the samples are acquired by point evaluations of the input signal\nf, then there exist stable LTI systems H such that the approximation process\ndoes not converge to the desired output H(f) even if the oversampling factor is\narbitrarily large.

However Shannon's theory of information does not provide\nformulae to fully determine these quantities. Several recent studies have begun\naddressing this. Some possible definitions for PID quantities have been\nproposed, and some analyses have been carried out on systems composed of\ndiscrete variables. Here we present the first in-depth analysis of PIDs on\nGaussian systems, both static and dynamical. We show that, for a broad class of\nGaussian systems, previously proposed PID formulae imply that: (i) redundancy\nreduces to the minimum information provided by either source variable, and\nhence is independent of correlation between sources; (ii) synergy is the extra\ninformation contributed by the weaker source when the stronger source is known,\nand can either increase or decrease with correlation between sources.

Most existing decoding algorithms of polar codes are based on\nbit-wise hard or soft decisions. In this paper, we propose symbol-decision\nsuccessive cancellation (SC) and successive cancellation list (SCL) decoders\nfor polar codes, which use symbol-wise hard or soft decisions for higher\nthroughput or better error performance. First, we propose to use a recursive\nchannel combination to calculate symbol-wise channel transition probabilities,\nwhich lead to symbol decisions. Our proposed recursive channel combination also\nhas a lower complexity than simply combining bit-wise channel transition\nprobabilities. The similarity between our proposed method and Arikan's channel\ntransformations also helps to share hardware resources between calculating bit-\nand symbol-wise channel transition probabilities. Second, a two-stage list\npruning network is proposed to provide a trade-off between the error\nperformance and the complexity of the symbol-decision SCL decoder. Third, since\nmemory is a significant part of SCL decoders, we propose a pre-computation\nmemory-saving technique to reduce memory requirement of an SCL decoder.\nFinally, to evaluate the throughput advantage of our symbol-decision decoders,\nwe design an architecture based on a semi-parallel successive cancellation list\ndecoder. In this architecture, different symbol sizes, sorting implementations,\nand message scheduling schemes are considered. Our synthesis results show that\nin terms of area efficiency, our symbol-decision SCL decoders outperform both\nbit- and symbol-decision SCL decoders. \n\n"}

In this problem, we are given a set of\n$n$ points in Euclidean space $R^d$, and the goal is to choose $k$ centers in\n$R^d$ so that the sum of squared distances of each point to its nearest center\nis minimized. The best approximation algorithms for this problem include a\npolynomial time constant factor approximation for general $k$ and a\n$(1+\\epsilon)$-approximation which runs in time $poly(n) 2^{O(k/\\epsilon)}$. At\nthe other extreme, the only known computational complexity result for this\nproblem is NP-hardness [ADHP'09]. The main difficulty in obtaining hardness\nresults stems from the Euclidean nature of the problem, and the fact that any\npoint in $R^d$ can be a potential center. This gap in understanding left open\nthe intriguing possibility that the problem might admit a PTAS for all $k,d$.\n  In this paper we provide the first hardness of approximation for the\nEuclidean $k$-means problem. Concretely, we show that there exists a constant\n$\\epsilon > 0$ such that it is NP-hard to approximate the $k$-means objective\nto within a factor of $(1+\\epsilon)$.

However, in some potential applications (e.g., sensor\nnetworks with clustering structure), the obtained data may be a combination of\nsignals associated with several vertices, rather than the decimation. In this\npaper, we propose a new concept of local measurement, which is a generalization\nof decimation. Using the local measurements, a local-set-based method named\niterative local measurement reconstruction (ILMR) is proposed to reconstruct\nbandlimited graph signals. It is proved that ILMR can reconstruct the original\nsignal perfectly under certain conditions. The performance of ILMR against\nnoise is theoretically analyzed. The optimal choice of local weights and a\ngreedy algorithm of local set partition are given in the sense of minimizing\nthe expected reconstruction error.

We consider a scenario where sensors need to identify\nwhether a given event has occurred based on its periodic, noisy, observations\nof a given signal. Such information about the signal needs to be sent to a\nfusion center that decides about the actual state at that specific observation\ntime. The communication links -- single- or multi-hop -- are modeled as binary\nsymmetric channels, which may have different error probabilities. The decision\nat the fusion center is based on OR, AND, K-OUT-OF-N and MAJORITY Boolean\noperations on the received signals associated to individual sensor\nobservations. We derive closed-form equations for the average decision error\nprobability as a function of the system parameters (e.g. number of sensors and\nhops) and the input signal characterization. Our analyses show the best\ndecision rule is closely related to the frequency that the observed events\noccur and the number of sensors.

To deal with the potentially\nexcessive interference originating from a plethora of geographically\ndistributed transmission sources, a pair of transmission protocols based on\ninterference alignment (IA) are conceived. The first, termed the full-IA,\navoids all intra-cell interference (ICI) and other-cell interference by finding\nthe perfect interference-nulling receive beamforming matrices (RxBFMs). The\nsecond protocol, termed partial-IA, only attempts to null the ICI. Employing\nthe RxBFMs computed by either of these protocols mathematically decomposes the\nchannel into a multiplicity of non-interfering multiple-input--single-output\nchannels, which we term as spatial multiplexing components (SMCs). The problem\nof finding the optimal SMCs as well as their power control variables for the\nESEM problem considered is formally defined and converted into a convex\noptimization form with carefully selected variable relaxations and\ntransformations. Thus, the optimal SMCs and power control variables can be\ndistributively computed using both the classic dual decomposition and\nsubgradient methods. Our results indicate that indeed, the ESEM algorithm\nperforms better than the baseline equal power allocation algorithm in terms of\nits ESE. Furthermore, surprisingly the partial-IA outperforms the full-IA in\nall cases considered, which is because the partial-IA is less restrictive in\nterms of the number of available transmit dimensions at the transmitters. Given\nthe typical cell sizes considered in this paper, the path-loss sufficiently\nattenuates the majority of the interference, and thus the full-IA\nover-compensates, when trying to avoid all possible sources of interference. \n\n"}

Most of the\nprior literature focuses on the reduction of load in the backhaul and core\nnetworks due to caching, i.e., on the benefits caching offers for the wireline\ncommunication link between the origin server and the caches. In this paper, we\nare instead interested in the benefits caching can offer for the wireless\ncommunication link between the caches and the end users.\n  To quantify the gains of caching for this wireless link, we consider an\ninterference channel in which each transmitter is equipped with an isolated\ncache memory. Communication takes place in two phases, a content placement\nphase followed by a content delivery phase. The objective is to design both the\nplacement and the delivery phases to maximize the rate in the delivery phase in\nresponse to any possible user demands. Focusing on the three-user case, we show\nthat through careful joint design of these phases, we can reap three distinct\nbenefits from caching: a load balancing gain, an interference cancellation\ngain, and an interference alignment gain. In our proposed scheme, load\nbalancing is achieved through a specific file splitting and placement,\nproducing a particular pattern of content overlap at the caches. This overlap\nallows to implement interference cancellation. Further, it allows us to create\nseveral virtual transmitters, each transmitting a part of the requested\ncontent, which increases interference-alignment possibilities. \n\n"}

However, ELUs have improved learning characteristics compared\nto the units with other activation functions. In contrast to ReLUs, ELUs have\nnegative values which allows them to push mean unit activations closer to zero\nlike batch normalization but with lower computational complexity. Mean shifts\ntoward zero speed up learning by bringing the normal gradient closer to the\nunit natural gradient because of a reduced bias shift effect. While LReLUs and\nPReLUs have negative values, too, they do not ensure a noise-robust\ndeactivation state.

We formulate\na stochastic game for this system in three different scenarios. First, we\nassume that each user knows all direct and cross link channel gains. Later, we\nassume that each user knows channel gains of only the links that are incident\non its receiver. Lastly, we assume that each user knows only its own direct\nlink channel gain. In all cases, we formulate the problem of finding a Nash\nequilibrium (NE) as a variational inequality (VI) problem. We present a novel\nheuristic for solving a VI.

Contrary to the conventional approach adopted in literature,\nwe propose a rather unorthodox design based on a Rate-Splitting (RS) strategy.\nEach user's message is split into two parts, a common part and a private part.\nAll common parts are packed into one super common message encoded using a\npublic codebook, while private parts are independently encoded. The resulting\nsymbol streams are linearly precoded and simultaneously transmitted, and each\nreceiver retrieves its intended message by decoding both the common stream and\nits corresponding private stream. For CSIT uncertainty regions that scale with\nSNR (e.g. by scaling the number of feedback bits), we prove that a RS-based\ndesign achieves higher max-min (symmetric) Degrees of Freedom (DoF) compared to\nconventional designs (NoRS).

We define a distance (\"small set TV\" or ssTV) between\ndistributions $P$ and $Q$ by taking the maximum, over all subsets $\\mathcal{S}$\nof a given size, of the total variation between the marginals of $P$ and $Q$ on\n$\\mathcal{S}$; this distance captures the accuracy of the prediction task of\ninterest. We derive non-asymptotic bounds on the number of samples needed to\nget a distribution (from the same class) with small ssTV relative to the one\ngenerating the samples. One of the main messages of this paper is that far\nfewer samples are needed than for recovering the underlying tree, which means\nthat accurate predictions are possible using the wrong tree. \n\n"}

In this paper, we use that\nexpression to analyze the finite-length scaling of these codes on the $q$-ary\nerasure channel with erasure probability $\\epsilon\\in(0,1)$.

To prove near-optimal scaling for polar codes with\nfixed $q$ as $m$ increases, however, two technical obstacles remain. Thus, we\nconclude by stating two concrete mathematical conjectures that, if proven,\nwould imply near-optimal scaling for fixed~$q$. \n\n"}

It is shown that if a small penalty of at most 0.1 dB SNR to the\nfull shaping gain is acceptable, just two shaped PMFs are required per\nquadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) over a large SNR range. For a multi-span\nwavelength division multiplexing (WDM) optical fiber system with 64QAM input,\nit is shown that just one PMF is required to achieve large gains over uniform\ninput for distances from 1,400 km to 3,000 km.

Our results show that,\nfor a fixed average optical launch power, a shaping gain is obtained for the\nnoise contributions from fiber amplifiers and modulation-independent nonlinear\ninterference (NLI), whereas shaping simultaneously causes a penalty as it leads\nto an increased NLI. However, this nonlinear shaping loss is found to have a\nrelatively minor impact, and optimizing the shaped PMF with a\nmodulation-dependent GN model confirms that the PMF found for AWGN is also a\ngood choice for a multi-span fiber system. \n\n"}

However, MIMO radar poses new challenges for both hardware design\nand digital processing. In particular, achieving high azimuth resolution\nrequires a large number of transmit and receive antennas. In addition, the\ndigital processing is performed on samples of the received signal, from each\ntransmitter to each receiver, at its Nyquist rate, which can be prohibitively\nlarge when high resolution is needed. Overcoming the rate bottleneck,\nsub-Nyquist sampling methods have been proposed that break the link between\nradar signal bandwidth and sampling rate. In this work, we extend these methods\nto MIMO configurations and propose a sub-Nyquist MIMO radar (SUMMeR) system\nthat performs both time and spatial compression. We present a\nrange-azimuth-Doppler recovery algorithm from sub-Nyquist samples obtained from\na reduced number of transmitters and receivers, that exploits the sparsity of\nthe recovered targets' parameters. This allows us to achieve reduction in the\nnumber of deployed antennas and the number of samples per receiver, without\ndegrading the time and spatial resolutions. Simulations illustrate the\ndetection performance of SUMMeR for different compression levels and shows that\nboth time and spatial resolution are preserved, with respect to classic Nyquist\nMIMO configurations. We also examine the impact of design parameters, such as\nantennas' locations and carrier frequencies, on the detection performance, and\nprovide guidelines for their choice. \n\n"}

This problem is typically formulated\nas a nonconvex maximum-likelihood estimation that is computationally hard to\nsolve in general. Nevertheless, in this paper we present an algorithm that is\nable to efficiently recover certifiably globally optimal solutions of the\nspecial Euclidean synchronization problem in a non-adversarial noise regime.\nThe crux of our approach is the development of a semidefinite relaxation of the\nmaximum-likelihood estimation whose minimizer provides an exact MLE so long as\nthe magnitude of the noise corrupting the available measurements falls below a\ncertain critical threshold; furthermore, whenever exactness obtains, it is\npossible to verify this fact a posteriori, thereby certifying the optimality of\nthe recovered estimate. We develop a specialized optimization scheme for\nsolving large-scale instances of this relaxation by exploiting its low-rank,\ngeometric, and graph-theoretic structure to reduce it to an equivalent\noptimization problem on a low-dimensional Riemannian manifold, and design a\ntruncated-Newton trust-region method to solve this reduction efficiently.\nFinally, we combine this fast optimization approach with a simple rounding\nprocedure to produce our algorithm, SE-Sync.

This\nproblem has recently received attention in two settings: (1) where $p$ is\nassumed to be Gaussian and (2) where $p$ is assumed only to lie in a large\nnonparametric smoothness class. Estimators proposed for the Gaussian case\nconverge in high dimensions when the Gaussian assumption holds, but are\nbrittle, failing dramatically when $p$ is not Gaussian. Estimators proposed for\nthe nonparametric case fail to converge with realistic sample sizes except in\nvery low dimensions. As a result, there is a lack of robust mutual information\nestimators for many realistic data. To address this, we propose estimators for\nmutual information when $p$ is assumed to be a nonparanormal (a.k.a., Gaussian\ncopula) model, a semiparametric compromise between Gaussian and nonparametric\nextremes.

Since this bi-objective\noptimization problem is inherently complex to solve, we put forward two\ndifferent scalarization methods to convert it into a scalar optimization\nproblem.

In order to capture the VR users' quality-of-service (QoS) in SCNs, a\nnovel VR model, based on multi-attribute utility theory, is proposed. This\nmodel jointly accounts for VR metrics such as tracking accuracy, processing\ndelay, and transmission delay. In this model, the small base stations (SBSs)\nact as the VR control centers that collect the tracking information from VR\nusers over the cellular uplink. Once this information is collected, the SBSs\nwill then send the three dimensional images and accompanying surround stereo\naudio to the VR users over the downlink. Therefore, the resource allocation\nproblem in VR wireless networks must jointly consider both the uplink and\ndownlink. This problem is then formulated as a noncooperative game and a\ndistributed algorithm based on the machine learning framework of echo state\nnetworks (ESNs) is proposed to find the solution of this game. The use of the\nproposed ESN algorithm enables the SBSs to predict the VR QoS of each SBS and\nguarantees the convergence to a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium. The analytical\nresult shows that each user's VR QoS jointly depends on both VR tracking\naccuracy and wireless resource allocation. Simulation results show that the\nproposed algorithm yields significant gains, in terms of total utility value of\nVR QoS, that reach up to 22.2% and 37.5%, respectively, compared to Q-learning\nand a baseline proportional fair algorithm.

Moreover, the results also\nreveal that the increase of ST is at the expense of the degradation of CP.\nTherefore, to balance the tradeoff between user and system performance, we\nfurther study the critical density, under which ST could be maximized under the\nCP constraint.

The full benefit of NOMA depends on resource\nallocation, including power allocation and channel assignment, for all users,\nwhich, however, leads to mixed integer programs. In the literature, the optimal\npower allocation has only been found in some special cases, while the joint\noptimization of power allocation and channel assignment generally requires\nexhaustive search. In this paper, we investigate resource allocation in\ndownlink NOMA systems. As the main contribution, we analytically characterize\nthe optimal power allocation with given channel assignment over multiple\nchannels under different performance criteria. Specifically, we consider the\nmaximin fairness, weighted sum rate maximization, sum rate maximization with\nquality of service (QoS) constraints, energy efficiency maximization with\nweights or QoS constraints in NOMA systems. We also take explicitly into\naccount the order constraints on the powers of the users on each channel, which\nare often ignored in theexisting works, and show that they have a significant\nimpact on SIC in NOMA systems. Then, we provide the optimal power allocation\nfor the considered criteria in closed or semi-closed form. We also propose a\nlow-complexity efficient method to jointly optimize channel assignment and\npower allocation in NOMA systems by incorporating the matching algorithm with\nthe optimal power allocation. Simulation results show that the joint resource\noptimization using our optimal power allocation yields better performance than\nthe existing schemes. \n\n"}

This\nis done by considering the Theil index, which is an established statistical\nmeasure used to determine levels of inequality across a system of `agents',\ne.g., income levels across a population. Here, we establish a Theil index for\ngraphs, which provides us with a macroscopic measure of graph centralization.\nConcretely, we show that the von Neumann index can be used to bound the graph's\nTheil index, and thus we provide a direct characterization of graph\ncentralization via the von Neumann index. Because of the algebraic similarities\nbetween the bound and the Theil index, we call the bound the von Neumann Theil\nindex. %From an information theoretic perspective, the von Neumann Theil index\ndescribes the mutual information between the quantum state corresponding to a\ngraph and the maximally mixed state (which corresponds to the complete graph).\nWe elucidate our ideas by providing examples and a discussion of different\n$n=7$ vertex graphs. We also discuss how the von Neumann Theil index provides a\nmore comprehensive measure of centralization when compared to traditional\ncentralization measures, and when compared to the graph's classical Theil\nindex. This is because it more accurately accounts for macro-structural changes\nthat occur from micro-structural changes in the graph (e.g., the removal of a\nvertex). Finally, we provide future direction, showing that the von Neumann\nTheil index can be generalized by considering the R\\'enyi entropy. We then show\nthat this generalization can be used to bound the negative logarithm of the\ngraph's Jain fairness index. \n\n"}

Discrete-time algorithms are presented for timing and carrier\nsynchronization, as well as channel estimation, for turbo coded multiple input\nmultiple output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexed (OFDM)\nsystems. Simulation results show that it is possible to achieve a bit error\nrate of $10^{-5}$ at an average SNR per bit of 5.5 dB, using two transmit and\ntwo receive antennas. We then propose a near-capacity signaling method in which\neach transmit antenna uses a different carrier frequency. Using the\nnear-capacity approach, we show that it is possible to achieve a BER of\n$2\\times 10^{-5}$ at an average SNR per bit of just 2.5 dB, with one receive\nantenna for each transmit antenna. When the number of receive antennas for each\ntransmit antenna is increased to 128, then a BER of $2\\times 10^{-5}$ is\nattained at an average SNR per bit of 1.25 dB. In all cases, the number of\ntransmit antennas is two and the spectral efficiency is 1 bit/transmission or 1\nbit/sec/Hz. In other words, each transmit antenna sends 0.5 bit/transmission.\nIt is possible to obtain higher spectral efficiency by increasing the number of\ntransmit antennas, with no loss in BER performance, as long as each transmit\nantenna uses a different carrier frequency. The transmitted signal spectrum for\nthe near-capacity approach can be restricted by pulse-shaping. In all the\nsimulations, a four-state turbo code is used. The corresponding turbo decoder\nuses eight iterations. The algorithms can be implemented on programmable\nhardware and there is a large scope for parallel processing. \n\n"}

The originality of this work resides in that this new notion\nof hypercontractivity is given in terms of the so-called amalgamated\n$\\mathbb{L}_p$ norms introduced recently by Junge and Parcet in the context of\noperator spaces theory. We make three main contributions. The first one is a\nversion of Gross' integration lemma: we prove that (weak) HC implies (weak)\nLSI. Surprisingly, the converse implication differs from the primitive case as\nwe show that LSI implies HC but with a weak constant equal to the cardinal of\nthe center of the decoherence-free algebra. Building on the first implication,\nour second contribution is the fact that strong LSI and therefore strong HC do\nnot hold for non-trivially primitive QMS.

A very common assumption in the use of this method is that the\ngradient of the smooth term is globally Lipschitz continuous.

When multiple devices seek to use such a facility\nsimultaneously, both the available computational resources and the available\ncommunication resources need to be appropriately allocated. In this manuscript,\nwe seek insight into the impact of the choice of the multiple access scheme by\ndeveloping solutions to the mobile energy minimization problem in the two-user\ncase with plentiful shared computational resources. In that setting, the\nallocation of communication resources is constrained by the latency constraints\nof the applications, the computational capabilities and the transmission power\nconstraints of the devices, and the achievable rate region of the chosen\nmultiple access scheme.

One of the key advantages is that our technique relies on\nthe use of heat kernels, which allows for applications in settings where the\nFourier transform is not the most suitable tool. In addition, it provides\nexplicit constants that are key to prove, under minimal conditions on $u$, the\nvalidity of the pointwise limits $$\\lim_{s\\to1^-}(-\\Delta)^su(x)=-\\Delta\nu(x)\\quad\\hbox{and}\\quad\\lim_{s\\to0^+}(-\\Delta)^su(x)=u(x).$$ The formula for\nthe solution to the Poisson problem $(-\\Delta)^su=f$ is found through the\nsemigroup approach as the inverse of the fractional Laplacian\n$u(x)=(-\\Delta)^{-s}f(x)$ (fundamental solution). We then present the\nCaffarelli--Silvestre extension problem, whose explicit solution is given by\nthe semigroup formulas that were first discovered by the author and Torrea.\nWith the extension technique, an interior Harnack inequality and derivative\nestimates for fractional harmonic functions can be obtained. The classical\nH\\\"older and Schauder estimates $$(-\\Delta)^{\\pm s}:C^\\alpha\\to C^{\\alpha\\mp\n2s}$$ are proved with the method of semigroups in a rather quick, elegant way.\nThe crucial point for this will be the characterization of H\\\"older and Zygmund\nspaces with heat semigroups. \n\n"}

Within this\nframework, every active device partitions its data into several sub-blocks and,\nsubsequently, adds redundancy using a systematic linear block code.

In quantum information theory, there are three\ngeneralizations of the classical R\\'enyi divergence -- the Petz's, sandwiched,\nand log-Euclidean versions, that possess meaningful operational interpretation.\nHowever, the associated quantum R\\'enyi and Augustin information are much less\nexplored compared with their classical counterpart, and lacking crucial\nproperties hinders applications of these quantities to error exponent analysis\nin the quantum regime. The goal of this paper is to analyze fundamental\nproperties of the R\\'enyi and Augustin information from a noncommutative\nmeasure-theoretic perspective. Firstly, we prove the uniform equicontinuity for\nall three quantum versions of R\\'enyi and Augustin information, and it hence\nyields the joint continuity of these quantities in order and prior input\ndistributions. Secondly, we establish the concavity of the scaled R\\'enyi and\nAugustin information in the region of $s\\in(-1,0)$ for both Petz's and the\nsandwiched versions.

These schemes are called modular BRI schemes. An\nupper bound on the semantic security information leakage of modular BRI schemes\nin a one-shot setting is derived which separates the effects of the biregular\nirreducible function on the one hand and the error-correcting code plus the\nchannel on the other hand. The effect of the biregular irreducible function is\ndescribed by the second-largest eigenvalue of an associated stochastic matrix.\nA characterization of biregular irreducible functions is given in terms of\nconnected edge-disjoint biregular graphs. It allows for the construction of new\nbiregular irreducible functions from families of edge-disjoint Ramanujan\ngraphs, which are shown to exist. A frequently used arithmetic universal hash\nfunction can be converted into a biregular irreducible function for certain\nparameters.

Under the assumption that the difference vector is sparse and that\nits Hamming weight is at the most a known constant, the objective is to design\na linear code with as small a codelength as possible that allows successful\nupdate of the linear function at the receiver. This problem is motivated by\napplications to distributed data storage systems.

Especially via Connes' distance formula one is\nable to extract from the spectral properties of D the geodesic distance on M.\nIn this paper we investigate the distance d encoded within a covariant Dirac\noperator on a trivial U(n)-fiber bundle over the circle with arbitrary\nconnection. It turns out that the connected components of d are tori whose\ndimension is given by the holonomy of the connection. For n=2 we explicitly\ncompute d on all the connected components. For n>2 we restrict to a given fiber\nand find that the distance is given by the trace of the module of a matrix. The\nlatest is defined by the holonomy and the coordinates of the points under\nconsideration. This paper extends to arbitrary n and arbitrary connection the\nresults obtained in hep-th/0506147 for U(2)-bundle with constant connection. It\nconfirms interesting properties of the spectral distance with respect to\nanother distance naturally associated to connection, namely the horizontal or\nCarnot-Caratheodory distance d_H.
