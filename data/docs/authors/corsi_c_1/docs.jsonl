Planets of low metallicity stars typically do\nnot reside at small orbital separations. The dependance of planetary system\nproperties on metallicity is clearly seen when the quantity Ie=Mp[a(1-e)]^2 is\nconsidered; Mp, a, e, are the planet mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity,\nrespectively. In high metallicity systems there is a concentration of systems\nat high and low values of Ie, with a low-populated gap near Ie~0.3 M_J AU^2,\nwhere M_J is Jupiter's mass. In low metallicity systems the concentration is\nonly at the higher range of I_e, with a tail to low values of Ie.

As young AGN\n(quasars) they are initially several magnitudes sub-luminous to mature galaxies\nbut their luminosity gradually increases over 10^8 yrs, as z_(i) decreases and\nthey evolve into mature AGN (Seyferts and radio galaxies).

We consider only the $X$-nuclear reactions and assume that the effect\nof decay products is negligible, as would be the case if lifetime were large or\nthe mass difference between the charged particle and its daughter were small.\nAn interesting feature of this paradigm is that, because the particle remains\nbound to the existing nuclei after the cessation of the usual big bang nuclear\nreactions, a second longer epoch of nucleosynthesis can occur among $X$-nuclei.\nWe confirm that reactions in which the hypothetical particle is transferred can\noccur that greatly enhance the production of $^6$Li while depleting $^7$Li. We\nalso identify a new reaction that destroys large amounts of $^7$Be, and hence\nreduces the ultimate $^7$Li abundance. Thus, big-bang nucleosynthesis in the\npresence of these hypothetical particles, together with or without an event of\nstellar processing, can simultaneously solve the two Li abundance problems. \n\n"}

Here we report on a measurement of the SN Ia DTD in a delay time range\nof t_Ia = 0.1-8.0 Gyr by using the faint variable objects detected in the\nSubaru/XMM-Newton Deep Survey (SXDS) down to i' ~ 25.5. We select 65 SN\ncandidates showing significant spatial offset from nuclei of the host galaxies\nhaving old stellar population at z ~ 0.4-1.2, out of more than 1,000 SXDS\nvariable objects. Although spectroscopic type classification is not available\nfor these, we quantitatively demonstrate that more than ~80% of these should be\nSNe Ia. The DTD is derived using the stellar age estimates of the old galaxies\nbased on 9 band photometries from optical to mid-infrared wavelength. Combined\nwith the observed SN Ia rate in elliptical galaxies at the local universe, the\nDTD in t_Ia ~ 0.1-10 Gyr is well described by a featureless power-law as\nf_D(t_Ia) \\propto t_Ia^{-1}.

The most striking feature is a long tail of\nemission, which consists of a plume ~ 4' north of M86 and two main extensions\nemanating from the plume. Based on the morphology and temperature structure of\nthe tail, we conclude that it is formed by ram pressure stripping of M86 as it\nfalls into the Virgo cluster and interacts with the Virgo ICM, in agreement\nwith earlier work. The tail is 150 kpc in projection, and a simple estimate\ngives a lower limit on the true length of the tail of 380 kpc, making this the\nlongest ram pressure stripped tail presently known. The total gas mass in the\nplume (7x10^8 M_sun) and tail (1x10^9 M_sun) is about three times that in the\ncore of M86, which supports the scenario where most of the gas was stripped\nrapidly and recently. The projected position of the plume can be understood if\nM86 has an aspherical potential, as suggested by optical isophotes.

A\nsample of 388 field stars as well as stars in globular clusters is used for a\ndirect comparison of the synthetic indices versus empirical data and for\nscrutinizing the possibilities of theoretical calibrations for temperature,\nmetallicity and gravity.

The theoretical\nmetallicity sensitivity of the m1 index (and for G-type stars its combination\nwith c1) is somewhat larger than the empirical one, based upon spectroscopic\ndeterminations. The gravity sensitivity of the synthetic c1 index shows a\nsatisfactory behaviour when compared to obervations of F stars.

While past assessments were based on only the inspiral/ring-down\npieces of the coalescence signal, the recent progress in analytical and\nnumerical relativity enables us to make more accurate projections using\n\"complete\" inspiral-merger-ringdown waveforms.

The distributions also show marked asymmetries, with a\nhigh-value tail set by clustering on small scales, and a shorter low-value tail\nwhich is set by the mean free path. The power spectrum of the ionizing\nbackground is much more sensitive to source properties than the PDF and can be\nwell-understood analytically with a framework similar to the halo model\n(usually used to describe dark matter clustering). Nevertheless, we find that\nLya forest spectra are extremely insensitive to the details of the UVB, despite\nmarked differences in the PDFs and power spectra of our various ionizing\nbackgrounds. Assuming a uniform ionizing background only underestimates the\nvalue of the mean ionization rate inferred from the Lya forest by a few\npercent. Instead, analysis of the Lya forest is dominated by the uncertainties\nin the density field. Thus, our results justify the common assumption of a\nuniform ionizing background in Lya forest analysis even during this epoch. \n\n"}

We derive a new weak lensing estimator which exploits\nthis effect and makes full use of both the observed galaxy shapes and the\nestimates of the intrinsic position angles as provided by polarization. Our\nmethod has the potential to both reduce the effects of shot noise, and to\nreduce to negligible levels, in a model-independent way, all effects of\nintrinsic galaxy alignments. We test our technique on simulated weak lensing\nskies, including an intrinsic alignment contaminant consistent with recent\nobservations, in three overlapping redshift bins. Adopting a standard weak\nlensing analysis and ignoring intrinsic alignments results in biases of 5-10%\nin the recovered power spectra and cosmological parameters.

While some areas of astronomy (most notably\npulsar studies) have required absolute time stamps with precisions of\nconsiderably better than 1 minute for many decades, recently new areas have\ncrossed into this regime.

That is why both phenomena should be\ntaken into account at once, as the gravitational collapse is considered. Since,\nunder the above transition, the hadronic-phase (HPh) vacuum (filled up with\ngluon- and chiral $q\\bar q$-condensates) turns into the \"empty\" (perturbation)\nsubhadronic-phase (SHPh) one and, thus, the formerly (very high) pressure falls\ndown rather abruptly, the formerly cold nuclear medium starts imploding almost\nfreely into the new vacuum. If the star mass is sufficiently large, then this\nimplosion is shown to result in an enormous heating - up to the temperature\nabout 100 MeV or, may be, even higher - and growth of the inner pressure due to\ndegeneracy breaking and multiple $q\\bar q$-pair production which withstands the\ngravitational compression (remind that the highest temperatures of supernovae\nbursts, as well as of the \"normal\" NS, are, at least, of one order lower).

In\nthis work we compute the power spectrum in general multi-field models and show\nthat certain inflaton trajectories may lead to observationally significant\nimprints of `heavy' physics in the primordial power spectrum if the inflaton\ntrajectory turns, that is, traverses a bend, sufficiently fast (without\ninterrupting slow roll), even in cases where the normal modes have masses\napproaching the cutoff of our theory.

When $M_{crit}$ is higher than the maximum mass achieved by the WD,\nthe WD must spin down before it can explode. This introduces a delay between\nthe time at which the WD has completed its epoch of mass gain and the time of\nthe explosion. Matter ejected from the binary during mass transfer therefore\nhas a chance to become diffuse, and the explosion occurs in a medium with a\ndensity similar to that of typical regions of the interstellar medium. Also,\neither by the end of the WD's mass increase or else by the time of explosion,\nthe donor may exhaust its stellar envelope and become a WD. This alters,\ngenerally diminishing, explosion signatures related to the donor star.\nNevertheless, the spin-up/spin-down model is highly predictive.

The asymmetry\nrequired in the thermal radiation field to produce polarization may arise\neither from the rotation-induced oblateness or from surface inhomogeneities,\nsuch as partial cloudiness. While it is not possible at present to predict the\nextent to which atmospheric dynamics on a given planet may produce surface\ninhomogeneities substantial enough to produce net non-zero disk integrated\npolarization, the contribution of rotation-induced oblateness can be estimated.\nUsing a self-consistent, spatially homogeneous atmospheric model and a multiple\nscattering polarization formalism for this class of exoplanets, we show that\npolarization on the order of 1% may arise due to the rotation-induced\noblateness of the planets.

Our Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the Salpeter\npower-law index is the limiting value obtained for the cluster IMF when the\nlower-mass limits for allowed stellar masses and star-forming clumps are\neffectively equal, m_lo = M_lo. This condition indeed is imposed for the\nhigh-mass IMF tail by the turn-over at the characteristic value m_c ~ 1 M_sun.\nIMF slopes of GAMMA ~ 2 are obtained if the stellar and clump upper-mass limits\nare also equal m_up = M_up ~ 100 M_sun, and so our model explains the observed\nrange of IMF slopes between GAMMA ~ 1 to 2.

The properties\nof cold- and hot-mode gas, which we separate depending on whether the\ntemperature has been higher than 10^5.5 K while it was extragalactic, are\nclearly distinguishable in the outer parts of massive haloes (virial\ntemperatures >> 10^5 K. The differences between cold- and hot-mode gas resemble\nthose between inflowing and outflowing gas. The cold-mode gas is mostly\nconfined to clumpy filaments that are approximately in pressure equilibrium\nwith the diffuse, hot-mode gas. Besides being colder and denser, cold-mode gas\ntypically has a much lower metallicity and is much more likely to be infalling.\nHowever, the spread in the properties of the gas is large, even for a given\nmode and a fixed radius and halo mass, which makes it impossible to make strong\nstatements about individual gas clouds. Metal-line cooling causes a strong\ncooling flow near the central galaxy, which makes it hard to distinguish gas\naccreted through the cold and hot modes in the inner halo. Stronger feedback\nresults in larger outflow velocities and pushes hot-mode gas to larger radii.\nThe gas properties evolve as expected from virial arguments, which can also\naccount for the dependence of many gas properties on halo mass. We argue that\ncold streams penetrating hot haloes are observable as high-column density HI\nLyman-alpha absorption systems in sightlines near massive foreground galaxies. \n\n"}

We show that requiring continuity with\npost-reionization (z<6) measurements, where the Lya forest provides a complete\nprobe of the cosmological emissivity of ionizing photons, significantly reduces\nthe permitted parameter space. Models that are simultaneously consistent with\nthe measured UV luminosity function, the Thomson optical depth to the CMB, and\nthe Lya forest data require either: 1) extrapolation of the galaxy luminosity\nfunction down to very faint UV magnitudes M_lim ~ -10, corresponding roughly to\nthe UV background suppression scale; 2) an increase of f_esc by a factor > ~10\nfrom z=4 (where the best fit is 4%) to z=9; or 3) more likely, a hybrid\nsolution in which undetected galaxies contribute significantly and f_esc\nincreases more modestly. Models in which star formation is strongly suppressed\nin low-mass, reionization-epoch haloes of mass up to ~10^10 M_sun (e.g., owing\nto a metallicity dependence) are only allowed for extreme assumptions for the\nevolution of f_esc.

We focus on the IGM close to the\ngalaxies as the detailed ionization distribution and velocity fields of this\nregion could significantly influence the scattering of Ly-alpha photons off\nneutral H atoms as they traverse the IGM after escaping from the galaxy. We\nsimulate the surface brightness (SB) maps and spectra of more than 100 LAEs at\nz=7.7 as seen by an observer at z=0. To achieve this, we extract the source\nproperties of galaxies and their surrounding IGM from cosmological simulations\nof box sizes 5-30 Mpc/h and follow the coupled radiative transfer of ionizing\nand Ly-alpha radiation through the IGM using CRASH-alpha. We find that the\nsimulated SB profiles are extended and their detailed structure is affected by\ninhomogeneities in the IGM, especially at high neutral fractions. The\ndetectability of LAEs and the fraction of the flux observed depend heavily on\nthe shape of the SB profile and the SB threshold (SB_th) of the observational\ncampaign. Only ultradeep observations (e.g. SB_th ~ 10^-23\nergs/s/cm^2/arcsec^2) would be able to obtain the true underlying\nmass-luminosity relation and luminosity functions of LAEs. The details of our\nresults depend on whether Ly-alpha photons are significantly shifted in the\ngalaxy to longer wavelengths, the mean ionization fraction in the IGM and the\nclustering of ionizing sources. These effects can lead to an easier escape of\nLy-alpha photons with less scattering in the IGM and a concentrated SB profile\nsimilar to the one of a point source. Finally, we show that the SB profiles are\nsteeper at high ionization fraction for the same LAE sample which can\npotentially be observed from the stacked profile of a large number of LAEs. \n\n"}

Incontrovertible evidence was\nprovided by the miniature eclipses (\"transits\") of the stars by the planet.\nHowever, questions remain about the prevalence of circumbinary planets and\ntheir range of orbital and physical properties. Here we present two additional\ntransiting circumbinary planets, Kepler-34 and Kepler-35.

Due to\nthe orbital motion of the stars, the planets experience large multi-periodic\nvariations in incident stellar radiation.

RCB stars - a rare class of hydrogen-deficient\ncarbon-rich supergiants - are of great interest owing to the insights they can\nprovide on the late stages of stellar evolution. DYPers are possibly the\nlow-temperature, low-luminosity analogs to the RCB phenomenon, though\nadditional examples are needed to fully establish this connection. While RCB\nstars and DYPers are traditionally identified by epochs of extreme dimming that\noccur without regularity, the ML search framework more fully captures the\nrichness and diversity of their photometric behavior. We demonstrate that our\nML method can use newly discovered RCB stars to identify additional candidates\nwithin the same data set. Our search yields 15 candidates that we consider\nlikely RCB stars/DYPers: new spectroscopic observations confirm that four of\nthese candidates are RCB stars and four are DYPers. Our discovery of four new\nDYPers increases the number of known Galactic DYPers from two to six;\nnoteworthy is that one of the new DYPers has a measured parallax and is m ~ 7\nmag, making it the brightest known DYPer to date.

Alfven waves of a preferred\npolarization have maximally helical motion, because the transverse motion of\neach mode is parallel to its curl. We show how large-scale Alfven modes, when\nrendered unstable by cosmic ray streaming, can create new net flux over any\nfinite region, in the direction of the original large-scale field. We perform\ndirect numerical simulations (DNS) of an MHD fluid with a forced cosmic ray\ncurrent and use the test-field method to determine the alpha effect and the\nturbulent magnetic diffusivity. As follows from DNS, the dynamics of the\ninstability has the following stages: (i) in the early stage, the small-scale\nBell instability that results in a production of small-scale turbulence is\nexcited; (ii) in the intermediate stage, there is formation of larger-scale\nmagnetic structures; (iii) finally, quasi-stationary large-scale turbulence is\nformed at a growth rate that is comparable to that expected from the dynamo\ninstability, but its amplitude over much longer timescales remains unclear. The\nresults of DNS are in good agreement with the theoretical estimates.\n  It is suggested that this dynamo is what gives weakly magnetized relativistic\nshocks such as those from gamma ray bursts a macroscopic correlation length. It\nmay also be important for large-scale magnetic field amplification associated\nwith cosmic ray production and diffusive shock acceleration in supernova\nremnants (SNR) and blast waves from gamma ray bursts. Magnetic field\namplification by Bell turbulence in SNR is found to be significant, but it is\nlimited owing to the finite time available to the super-Alfvenicly expanding\nremnant. The effectiveness of the mechanisms is shown to be dependent on the\nshock velocity. \n\n"}

We observed PSR\nB0540-69 in the J, H, and Ks bands with the VLT to detect it, for the first\ntime, in the nIR and characterise its optical-to-nIR spectrum. To disentangle\nthe pulsar emission from that of its pulsar wind nebula (PWN), we obtained\nhigh-spatial resolution adaptive optics images with NACO.

The star cluster is\nundetected in X-rays, with an upper bound on 0.5-7 keV luminosity of L_X < 7.1\nx 10^37 erg/s. This bound implies a bolometric accretion luminosity <0.3\npercent of the Eddington luminosity for a black hole with the mass\n(approximately 3400 M_sun) expected from extrapolation of the M-sigma relation.\nThe lack of X-ray emission indicates that a black hole, if present, is not\nundergoing significant accretion at the current time. While the central cluster\nis undetected, the data reveal a substantial population of bright X-ray point\nsources elsewhere in this galaxy, with eight qualifying as ultraluminous X-ray\nsources with L_X > 10^39 erg/s.

{"id": "1206.1411", "contents": "Title: Adjustment of the electric current in pulsar magnetospheres and origin\n  of subpulse modulation Abstract: The subpulse modulation of pulsar radio emission goes to prove that the\nplasma flow in the open field line tube breaks into isolated narrow streams. I\npropose a model which attributes formation of streams to the process of the\nelectric current adjustment in the magnetosphere. A mismatch between the\nmagnetospheric current distribution and the current injected by the polar cap\naccelerator gives rise to reverse plasma flows in the magnetosphere. The\nreverse flow shields the electric field in the polar gap and thus shuts up the\nplasma production process. I assume that a circulating system of streams is\nformed such that the upward streams are produced in narrow gaps separated by\ndownward streams. The electric drift is small in this model because the\npotential drop in narrow gaps is small. The gaps have to drift because by the\ntime a downward stream reaches the star surface and shields the electric field,\nthe corresponding gap has to shift. The transverse size of the streams is\ndetermined by the condition that the potential drop in the gaps is sufficient\nfor the pair production. This yields the radius of the stream roughly 10% of\nthe polar cap radius, which makes it possible to fit in the observed\nmorphological features such as the \"carousel\" with 10-20 subbeams and the\nsystem of the core - two nested cone beams. \n\n"}

{"id": "1206.5056", "contents": "Title: Cosmic Acceleration from Causal Backreaction with Recursive\n  Nonlinearities Abstract: We revisit the causal backreaction paradigm, in which the need for Dark\nEnergy is eliminated via the generation of an apparent cosmic acceleration from\nthe causal flow of inhomogeneity information coming in towards each observer\nfrom distant structure-forming regions. This second-generation formalism\nincorporates \"recursive nonlinearities\": the process by which\nalready-established metric perturbations will then act to slow down all future\nflows of inhomogeneity information. Here, the long-range effects of causal\nbackreaction are now damped, weakening its impact for models that were\npreviously best-fit cosmologies. Nevertheless, we find that causal backreaction\ncan be recovered as a replacement for Dark Energy via the adoption of larger\nvalues for the dimensionless `strength' of the clustering evolution functions\nbeing modeled -- a change justified by the hierarchical nature of clustering\nand virialization in the universe, occurring on multiple cosmic length scales\nsimultaneously. With this, and with one new model parameter representing the\nslowdown of clustering due to astrophysical feedback processes, an alternative\ncosmic concordance can once again be achieved for a matter-only universe in\nwhich the apparent acceleration is generated entirely by causal backreaction\neffects. One drawback is a new degeneracy which broadens our predicted range\nfor the observed jerk parameter $j_{0}^{\\mathrm{Obs}}$, thus removing what had\nappeared to be a clear signature for distinguishing causal backreaction from\nCosmological Constant $\\Lambda$CDM. As for the long-term fate of the universe,\nincorporating recursive nonlinearities appears to make the possibility of an\n`eternal' acceleration due to causal backreaction far less likely; though this\ndoes not take into account gravitational nonlinearities or the large-scale\nbreakdown of cosmological isotropy, effects not easily modeled within this\nformalism. \n\n"}

As an illustration of\nthe method we investigate massive vector (Proca) perturbations in the Kerr\nmetric, which do not appear to be separable in the standard Teukolsky\nformalism. Working in a perturbative scheme, we discuss two important effects\ninduced by rotation: a Zeeman-like shift of nonaxisymmetric quasinormal modes\nand bound states with different azimuthal number m, and the coupling between\naxial and polar modes with different multipolar index l. We explicitly compute\nthe perturbation equations up to second order in rotation, but in principle the\nmethod can be extended to any order. Working at first order in rotation we show\nthat polar and axial Proca modes can be computed by solving two decoupled sets\nof equations, and we derive a single master equation describing axial\nperturbations of spin s=0 and s=+-1. By extending the calculation to second\norder we can study the superradiant regime of Proca perturbations in a\nself-consistent way. For the first time we show that Proca fields around Kerr\nblack holes exhibit a superradiant instability, which is significantly stronger\nthan for massive scalar fields.

SNe originating from stars with masses larger than 30M_sun are\nA-SNe in the \"ASN\" model whereas all SNe are spherical ones (S-SNe) in the\n\"SSN\" model.

Energetic\ncosmic neutrinos can interact inside the rock and produce leptons via a charged\ncurrent interaction. In the case of an incoming electron neutrino undergoing a\ncharged current interaction, the produced UHE electron will induce an\nunderground electromagnetic shower. At high energy (above 7.7 TeV in standard\nrock), such showers are subject to LPM (Landau, Pomeranchuk and Migdal)\nsuppression of the radiative processes cross sections (bremsstrahlung and pair\nproduction). The consequence of this suppression is that showers are elongated.\nThis effect will increase the detection probability of such events allowing\ndeeper showers to emerge with detectable energies.

Modeling this empirical relation from\nfirst principles proves challenging, however, and many questions regarding its\nproperties remain open. For instance, the exact functional form of the relation\nis still debated and it is also unknown whether it applies at z>4, where CO\nobservations are sparse. Here, we analyze how the shape of the star formation\n-- gas relation affects the cosmic star formation history and global galaxy\nproperties using an analytic model that follows the average evolution of\ngalaxies in dark matter halos across cosmic time. We show that a linear\nrelation with an H2 depletion time of ~2.5 Gyr, as found in studies of nearby\ngalaxies, results in good agreement with current observations of galaxies at\nboth low and high redshift. These observations include the evolution of the\ncosmic star formation rate density, the z~4-9 UV luminosity function, the\nevolution of the mass -- metallicity relation, the relation between stellar and\nhalo mass, and the gas-to-stellar mass ratios of galaxies. In contrast, the\nshort depletion times that result from adopting a highly super-linear star\nformation -- gas relation lead to large star formation rates, substantial metal\nenrichment (~0.1 solar), and low gas-to-stellar mass ratios already at z~10, in\ndisagreement with observations. These results can be understood in terms of an\nequilibrium picture of galaxy evolution in which gas inflows, outflows, and\nstar formation drive the metallicities and gas fractions toward equilibrium\nvalues that are determined by the ratio of the accretion time to the gas\ndepletion time. In this picture, the cosmic modulation of the accretion rate is\nthe primary process that drives the evolution of stellar masses, gas masses,\nand metallicities of galaxies from high redshift until today. \n\n"}

This work follows previous\nattempts to explain this asymmetry with an exospheric outflow or a bow shock,\ninduced by a planetary magnetic field, and provides a numerical solution of the\nearly-ingress, though we did not perform any radiative transfer calculation. We\nperformed pure 3D gas dynamic simulations of the plasma interaction between\nWASP-12b and its host star, and describe the flow pattern in the system.

Due to the conservation of the angular momentum, the flow to the L1\npoint is deflected in the direction of the planet's orbital motion, while the\nflow towards L2 is deflected in the opposite direction, resulting in a\nnon-axisymmetric envelope, surrounding the planet.

To do this, two classes of massive (M* >= 10^10.5 Msun) galaxy are\nselected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Munich semi-analytic\nmodel of galaxy formation, L-Galaxies. The first class is selected by high\nspecific star formation rates (sSFR) and high Zg, and the second class by low\nsSFR and low Zg. These criteria roughly distinguish disc-dominant galaxies from\nmetal-poor, elliptical galaxies. In the semi-analytic model, the second class\nof galaxies obtain low sSFR and low Zg due to gradual dilution of the\ninterstellar medium by accretion of metal-poor gas via infalling clumps and\nlow-mass satellites. This occurs after a merger-induced starburst and the\nassociated supernova feedback have quenched most of the original gas reservoir.\nA number of signatures of this evolution are present in these model galaxies at\nz=0, including low gas fractions, large central black holes, elliptical\nmorphologies, old ages, and importantly, low (Zg-Z*) indicating dilution after\nstar formation. Remarkably, all of these properties are also found in low-sSFR,\nlow-Zg, massive galaxies in the SDSS-DR7. This provides strong, indirect\nevidence that some elliptical galaxies are undergoing gradual dilution after a\ngas-rich merger in the local Universe. This dilution scenario also explains the\npositive correlation between SFR and Zg measured in high-M* galaxies, and\ntherefore has consequences for the local fundamental metallicity relation\n(FMR), which assumes a weak anti-correlation between SFR and Zg above 10^10.5\nMsun. \n\n"}

However there are no direct\nobservations of these layers. The aim of our work is to understand why we\nactually do not directly observe current layers and what we need to do it in\nthe future. The method is based on a simple mathematical model of a super-hot\n(T ~ 1E8 K) turbulent-current layer (SHTCL) and a model of plasma heating by\nthe layer. The models allow us to study a correspondence between the main\ncharacteristics of the layer, such as temperature and dimensions, and the\nobservational features, such as differential and integral emission measure of\nheated plasma, intensity of spectral lines Fe XXVI (1.78 and 1.51A) and Ni\nXXVII (1.59 A).

Abstract: The formation of very young massive clusters or \"starburst\" clusters is\ncurrently one of the most widely debated topic in astronomy. The classical\nnotion dictates that a star cluster is formed in-situ in a dense molecular gas\nclump followed by a substantial residual gas expulsion. On the other hand,\nbased on the observed morphologies of many young stellar associations, a\nhierarchical formation scenario is alternatively suggested. A very young (age\n$\\approx$ 1 Myr), massive ($>10^4M_\\odot$) star cluster like the Galactic NGC\n3603 young cluster (HD 97950) is an appropriate testbed for distinguishing\nbetween such \"monolithic\" and \"hierarchical\" formation scenarios. A recent\nstudy by Banerjee and Kroupa (2014) demonstrates that the monolithic scenario\nremarkably reproduces the HD 97950 cluster. In the present work, we explore the\npossibility of the formation of the above cluster via hierarchical assembly of\nsubclusters. These subclusters are initially distributed over a wide range of\nspatial volumes and have various modes of sub-clustering. Unlike the monolithic\nmodel that reproduces HD 97950 very well, the same is found to be prohibitive\nwith hierarchical assembly alone. Only those systems which assemble promptly\ninto a single cluster (in $\\lesssim1$ Myr) from a close separation (all within\n$\\lesssim2$ pc) could match the observed density profile of HD 97950 after\n$\\approx70$% gas dispersal. These results therefore suggest that NGC 3603 young\ncluster has formed essentially monolithically, i.e., either in-situ or via a\nprompt assembly, followed by a substantial residual gas expulsion. Both\nscenarios are consistent with the inferred young age and the small age spread\nof this cluster. Future observations of molecular cloud filaments with ALMA and\nproper motion measurements of young clusters with Gaia will provide more direct\ntests of such birth environments. [Abridged] \n\n"}

Our\nsimulations reveal that debris circularization depends sensitively on the\nefficiency of radiative cooling. There are two stages in debris circularization\nif radiative cooling is inefficient: first, the stellar debris streams\nself-intersect due to relativistic apsidal precession; shocks at the\nintersection points thermalize orbital energy and the debris forms a\ngeometrically thick, ring-like structure around the black hole. The ring\nrapidly spreads via viscous diffusion, leading to the formation of a\ngeometrically thick accretion disk. In contrast, if radiative cooling is\nefficient, the stellar debris circularizes due to self-intersection shocks and\nforms a geometrically thin ring-like structure. In this case, the dissipated\nenergy can be emitted during debris circularization as a precursor to the\nsubsequent tidal disruption flare. The possible radiated energy is up to\n~2*10^{52} erg for a 1 Msun star orbiting a 10^6 Msun black hole. We also find\nthat a retrograde (prograde) black hole spin causes the shock-induced\ncircularization timescale to be shorter (longer) than that of a non-spinning\nblack hole in both cooling cases. The circularization timescale is remarkably\nlong in the radiatively efficient cooling case, and is also sensitive to black\nhole spin. Specifically, Lense-Thirring torques cause dynamically important\nnodal precession, which significantly delays debris circularization.

It implements two novel components: the\nfirst is the use of the BAGIDIS wavelet methodology - a characterization of\nfunctional data using hierarchical wavelet coefficients. The second novelty is\nthe introduction of a ranked probability classifier on the wavelet coefficients\nthat handles both the heteroscedasticity of the data in addition to the\npotential non-representativity of the training set. The ranked classifier is\nsimple and quick to implement while a major advantage of the BAGIDIS wavelets\nis that they are translation invariant, hence they do not need the light curves\nto be aligned to extract features. Further, BAGIDIS is nonparametric so it can\nbe used for blind searches for new objects. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour ranked wavelet classifier against the well-tested Supernova Photometric\nClassification Challenge dataset in which the challenge is to correctly\nclassify light curves as Type Ia or non-Ia supernovae. We train our ranked\nprobability classifier on the spectroscopically-confirmed subsample (which is\nnot representative) and show that it gives good results for all supernova with\nobserved light curve timespans greater than 100 days (roughly 55% of the\ndataset).

Our analysis is based on the largest multiwavelength compact group\nsample to-date, containing complete ultraviolet-to-infrared (UV-to-IR)\nphotometry for 1,770 isolated groups (7,417 galaxies). We classified the\nnuclear activity of the galaxies based on optical emission line and\nmid-infrared diagnostic methods, as well as using spectral energy distribution\nfitting. We observe a 15% increase on the number of the AGN-hosting late-type\ngalaxies found in dynamically old groups, over the past 3 Gyr, accompanied by\nthe corresponding decrease of their circumnuclear star formation. Comparing our\ncompact group results with those of local isolated field and interacting pair\ngalaxies, we find no differences in the AGN at the same redshift range.

For gravity, there is no any\ncorrelation for red clump stars between the two databases, and scatters around\nthe calibrations of red giant stars are substantial. We found two main sources\nof the scatters of logg for red giant stars. One is a group of stars with\n$0.00253*Teff-8.67<logg<2.6 locating at the forbidden region, and the other is\nthe contaminated red clump stars, which could be picked out from the unmatched\nregion where stellar metallicity is not consistent with the position in the\nTeff versus logg diagram.

This correlation affects the\nmass-distribution in the Universe and leads to the off-diagonal correlations of\nthe density field modes in the form of the quadrupole anisotropy.\nInterestingly, this effect survives even after the tensor mode decays when it\nre-enters the horizon, known as the fossil effect. As a result, the\noff-diagonal correlation function between different Fourier modes of the\ndensity fluctuations can be thought as a way to probe the large-scale GW and\nthe mechanism of inflation behind the fossil effect. Models of single field\nslow roll inflation generically predict a very small quadrupole anisotropy in\nTSS while in models of multiple fields inflation this effect can be observable.\nTherefore this large scale quadrupole anisotropy can be thought as a\nspectroscopy for different inflationary models. In addition, in models of\nanisotropic inflation there exists quadrupole anisotropy in curvature\nperturbation power spectrum. Here we consider TSS in models of anisotropic\ninflation and show that the shape of quadrupole anisotropy is different than in\nsingle field models. In addition in these models the quadrupole anisotropy is\nprojected into the preferred direction and its amplitude is proportional to\n$g_* N_e$ where $N_e$ is the number of e-folds and $g_*$ is the amplitude of\nquadrupole anisotropy in curvature perturbation power spectrum.

Stars are\nproduced at an efficiency consistent with abundance matching constraints and\ncentral galaxies have star formation rates consistent with recent observations.\nWhile our simulations thus match various key properties remarkably well, we\nconclude that the shortcomings strongly suggest an important role for\nnon-thermal processes (through feedback or otherwise) or thermal conduction in\nshaping the intra-cluster medium. \n\n"}

We investigate the likelihood of an ice giant ejection event\nby either Jupiter or Saturn through constraints imposed by the current orbits\nof their wide-separation regular satellites Callisto and Iapetus respectively.\nWe show that planetary encounters that are sufficient to eject an ice giant,\noften provide excessive perturbations to the orbits of Callisto and Iapetus\nmaking it difficult to reconcile a planet ejection event with the current orbit\nof either satellite. Quantitatively, we compute the likelihood of reconciling a\nregular Jovian satellite orbit with the current orbit of Callisto following an\nice giant ejection by Jupiter of ~ 42% and conclude that such a large\nlikelihood supports the hypothesis of a fifth giant planet's existence.

We propose that the CNR\nformed through the tidal disruption of a molecular cloud, and we investigate\nthis scenario by means of N-body smoothed-particle hydrodynamics simulations.\nWe ran a grid of simulations with different cloud mass (4X10^4, 1.3X10^5 solar\nmasses), different initial orbital velocity (v_in=0.2-0.5 v_esc, where v_esc is\nthe escape velocity from the SMBH), and different impact parameter (b=8, 26\npc). The disruption of the molecular cloud leads to the formation of very dense\nand clumpy gas rings, containing most of the initial cloud mass. If the initial\norbital velocity of the cloud is sufficiently low (v_in<0.4 v_esc, for b=26 pc)\nor the impact parameter is sufficiently small (b<10 pc, for v_in>0.5 v_esc), at\nleast two rings form around the SMBH: an inner ring (with radius ~0.4 pc) and\nan outer ring (with radius ~2-4 pc). The inner ring forms from low-angular\nmomentum material that engulfs the SMBH during the first periapsis passage,\nwhile the outer ring forms later, during the subsequent periapsis passages of\nthe disrupted cloud.

We then compute the degree of alignment for\nfree-flying magnetic nanoparticles, taking into account various interaction\nprocesses of grains with the ambient gas and radiation field, including neutral\ncollisions, ion collisions, and infrared emission.

We begin with a heuristic formalism for\nunderstanding the mapping of sky coordinates into the cylindrically averaged\npower spectra measurements used by 21 cm experiments, with a focus on the\neffects of the instrument beam response and the associated sidelobes. We then\ndemonstrate this mapping by analyzing power spectra with both simulated and\nobserved data from the Murchison Widefield Array. We find that removing a\nforeground model which includes sources in both the main field-of-view and the\nfirst sidelobes reduces the contamination in high k_parallel modes by several\npercent relative to a model which only includes sources in the main\nfield-of-view, with the completeness of the foreground model setting the\nprincipal limitation on the amount of power removed.

Using two-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, we\ninvestigate particle and radiation beaming, finding a very different picture.\nInstead of having a relativistic average bulk motion with isotropic electron\nvelocity distribution in its rest frame, we find that the bulk motion of\nparticles in X-points is similar to their Lorentz factor gamma, and the\nparticles are beamed within about 5/gamma. On the way from the X-point to the\nmagnetic islands, particles turn in the magnetic field, forming a fan confined\nto the current sheet. Once they reach the islands they isotropise after\ncompleting a full Larmor gyration and their radiation is not strongly beamed\nanymore. The radiation pattern at a given frequency depends on where the\ncorresponding emitting electrons radiate their energy. Lower energy particles\nthat cool slowly spend most of their time in the islands, and their radiation\nis not highly beamed. Only particles that quickly cool at the edge of the\nX-points generate a highly beamed fan-like radiation pattern. The radiation\nemerging from these fast cooling particles is above the burn-off limit (about\n100 MeV in the overall rest frame of the reconnecting plasma.)

For the azimuthal wavenumber m=1 modes, the instability curves always scale\nwith the Reynolds number and the Hartmann number. For sufficiently small Pm\nthese modes therefore only become unstable for magnetic Mach numbers less than\nunity, and are thus not relevant for most astrophysical applications.

We\ndemonstrate the accuracy of our formalism for CR acceleration at shocks through\nsimulations of plane-parallel shock tubes that are compared to newly derived\nexact solutions of the Riemann shock tube problem with CR acceleration.

In our model angular momentum and mass are transported by a\ncombination of gravitational and bar-driven acoustic instabilities. In\ngravitationally-unstable regions the gas can form stars, and the resulting\nfeedback drives both turbulence and a wind that ejects mass from the CMZ. We\nshow that the CMZ is in a quasi-steady state where mass deposited at large\nradii by the bar is transported inward to a star-forming, ring-shaped region at\n$\\sim 100$ pc from the Galactic Centre, where the shear reaches a minimum.

The luminosity measurements are obtained based\non ~1.3 Ms of clean XMM data and ROSAT pointed observations. The masses are\nestimated using optical spectroscopic redshifts of 13647 cluster galaxies in\ntotal. Given sufficient numbers of member galaxies in computing the dynamical\nmasses, the L-M relations agree between the disturbed and undisturbed clusters.\nThe cool-core clusters still dominate the scatter in the L-M relation even when\na core corrected X-ray luminosity is used, which indicates that the scatter\nmainly reflects the structure formation history of the clusters.

Studying these remnants thus provides clues to understanding the\nevolutionary processes that lead to their formation.

These three observational features provide unique\ninformation on the physics of core collapse and supernovae explosions within\ninteracting binary systems. There is suggestive evidence for a gap between ~2-5\nMsun in the observed mass distribution.

The difference between neutron star mass measurements in\nlow-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) and pulsar masses in high-mass X-ray binaries\n(HMXBs) reflect their different accretion histories, with the latter presenting\nvalues close to birth masses.

An envelope of scatterers like\nfree-electrons, atoms/molecules, or haze/clouds affects the Stokes-vector of\nradiation emitted by oblate bodies. Due to high rotation rates, BDs can be\nconsiderably oblate. We present a conics-based radiative transfer (RT) scheme\nfor computing the disc-resolved and disc-integrated polarized emission of an\noblate BD or extrasolar giant planet (EGP) bearing homogenous or patchy clouds.\nAssuming a uniform grey atmosphere, we theoretically examine the\nphotopolarimetric sensitivity to its scattering properties like cloud optical\nthickness and grain-size, concurrently with BD properties, like oblateness,\ninclination and effective temperature, which are all treated as free\nparameters. Additionally, we examine the potential effects of gravitational\ndarkening (GD), revealing that it could significantly amplify disc-integrated\npolarization. GD imparts a non-linear inverse temperature-dependence to the\nresulting polarization.\n  Photopolarimetric observations are sensitive to oblateness and inclination.\nThe degree-of-polarization (DoP) increases in response to both, making it\npotentially useful for assessing the spatial orientation of the BD. Under our\nmodel assumptions, increasing droplet size in optically thick clouds causes a\nblue-ward shift in near-infrared (NIR) colors of BDs --- interesting in view of\nthe observed J-K brightening in L/T transition. For large cloud grains,\npolarization decreases sharply, while transmitted intensity shows a steady\nincrease. BD polarization is thus a potential indicator not only of the\npresence of clouds but also provides information on cloud grain size. \n\n"}

At the heart of this effort is quantifying\nthe degree of inconsistency between two or more cosmological data sets. We\nintroduce an intuitive moment-based measure we call the \\textit{index of\ninconsistency} (IOI) and show that it is sensitive to the separation of the\nmeans, the size of the constraint ellipsoids, and their orientations in the\nparameter space. We find that it tracks accurately the inconsistencies when\npresent. Next, we show that parameter marginalization can cause a loss of\ninformation on the inconsistency between two experiments and we quantify such a\nloss using the drop in IOI. In order to zoom on a given parameter, we define\nthe relative residual IOI and the relative drop in IOI. While these two\nquantities can provide insights on the parameters that are most responsible for\ninconsistencies, we find that the full IOI applied to the whole parameter\nspaces is what must be used to correctly reflect the degree of inconsistency\nbetween two experiments. We discuss various properties of IOI, provide its\neigenmode decomposition, and compare it to other measures of discordance.\nFinally, we apply IOI to current geometry data sets (i.e. an improved\nSupernovae Type Ia compilation, baryon acoustic oscillations from 6dF, SDSS MGS\nand Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest, and high-$\\ell$ CMB temperature data from\nPlanck-2015) versus growth data sets (i.e. Redshift Space Distortions from\nWiggleZ and SDSS, Weak Lensing from CFHTLenS, CMB Lensing, Sunyav-Zeldovich\neffect, and low-$\\ell$ CMB temperature and polarization data from Planck-2015).\nWe find that a persistent inconsistency is present between the two data sets.\nThis could reflect the presence of systematics in the data or inconsistencies\nin the underlying model. \n\n"}

To clarify these issues, we use a hydrodynamic\nsimulation of an isolated disc galaxy with a spatial resolution of a few tens\nparsecs. The evolution of dust abundance and grain size distribution is treated\nconsistently with the metal enrichment and the physical state of the\ninterstellar medium.

Simulations of low-Z massive stars (M$_{\\rm i}\\sim$ 150$-$600\nM$_{\\odot}$) show that both core-hydrogen-burning cool supergiants and hot\nionizing stellar sources are expected to be present simulaneously in young\nglobular clusters.

We find that the shell is gravitationally unstable on a\ntimescale that is shorter than the lifetime of the supergiant, and the\nBonnor-Ebert mass of the overdense regions is low enough to allow star\nformation. Since the low-mass stellar generation formed in this shell is made\nup of the material lost from the supergiant, its composition necessarily\nreflects the composition of the supergiant wind. We show that the wind contains\nhot-hydrogen-burning products, and that the shell-stars therefore have very\nsimilar abundance anomalies that are observed in the second generation stars of\nglobular clusters.

We have extracted aperture spectra of the lens and all the\nsources and fit the stellar continuum with STARLIGHT to estimate their stellar\nand emission line properties. A trace of past merger and active nucleus\nactivity is found in the lensing galaxy, while the background lensed galaxy is\nfound to be star-forming. Modeling the lensing potential with a singular\nisothermal ellipsoid, we find an Einstein radius of 1\\farcs45$\\pm$0\\farcs04,\nwhich corresponds to 1.9 kpc at the redshift of the lens and it is much smaller\nthan its effective radius ($r_{\\rm eff}\\sim$ 9\\arcsec). Comparing the Einstein\nmass and the STARLIGHT stellar mass within the same aperture yields a dark\nmatter fraction of $18 \\% \\pm 8$ \\% within the Einstein radius. The advent of\nlarge surveys such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will discover\na number of strong-lensed systems, and here we demonstrate how wide-field\nintegral field spectroscopy offers an excellent approach to study them and to\nprecisely model lensing effects. \n\n"}

Opaque\ngalaxies have shallower curves - in agreement with recent radiate transfer\nmodels. The dependence of slopes on the opacity produces an apparent dependence\non stellar mass: more massive galaxies having shallower slopes. Attenuation\ncurves exhibit a wide range of UV bump amplitudes, from none to MW-like; with\nan average strength 1/3 of the MW bump.

Pre-main sequence evolutionary tracks\nprovide a mass estimate of $0.34\\pm0.06 M_{\\odot}$, independent of the presence\nof a hot environment. However, the estimated stellar radius and age do depend\non that assumption; we find a radius of $1.37 \\pm 0.05 R_{\\odot}$ (resp. $1.96\n\\pm 0.10 R_{\\odot}$) and an age of $1.8^{+1.2}_{-0.5}$ Myr (resp. $0.75 \\pm\n0.25$ Myr) in the case of the presence (resp. absence) of a hot environment\ncontributing in $H$+$K$. Our new values for the mass and radius yield a mass\naccretion rate of $\\sim$5 $\\times 10^{-9} M_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ (2-3% that of\nthe primary).

We show that a globular cluster with a helium-rich\nconcentrated population will be slightly smaller than a globular cluster with a\nnormal-helium second generation, with the largest difference seen in the\nextended normal-helium population. This effect is shown both for a cluster in\nisolation and one in a realistic Milky Way tidal field.

Therefore, a mixed\nmagnetic field consisting of an ordered component and a random component is\nplausible for the early afterglow phase.

Three kinds of ordered component (i.e., aligned, toroidal and\nradial) are discussed. We find that the three cases are distinguishable through\njet polarization evolution.

These upper-atmosphere\nmodels contain prescriptions for the chromosphere and transition region and\ninclude newly added partial frequency redistribution capabilities. In the\nabsence of broadband UV spectral observations, we constrain our models using\nHST Ly$\\alpha$ observations from TRAPPIST-1 and GALEX FUV and NUV photometric\ndetections from a set of old M8 stars ($>$1 Gyr). We find that calibrating the\nmodels using both data sets separately yield similar FUV and NUV fluxes, and\nEUV fluxes that range from (1.32 - 17.4) $\\times$ 10$^{-14}$ ergs s$^{-1}$\ncm$^{-2}$. The results from these models demonstrate that the EUV emission is\nvery sensitive to the temperature structure in the transition region. Our lower\nactivity models predict EUV fluxes similar to previously published estimates\nderived from semi-empirical scaling relationships, while the highest activity\nmodel predicts EUV fluxes a factor of ten higher. Results from this study\nsupport the idea that the TRAPPIST-1 habitable zone planets likely do not have\nmuch liquid water on their surfaces due to the elevated levels of high energy\nradiation emitted by the host star. \n\n"}

The cluster is luminous\nin X-rays (L_bol = 4.8x10^37 W), and the host of the radio source is the\ncentral dominating galaxy of the cluster. The X-ray surface brightness profile\nis well fitted by a modified King beta model, but the cluster is elongated\nparallel to the radio source, especially on the scale of the radio lobes. Fits\nto individual quadrants give a core radius 50 per cent larger along the radio\naxis. Part of this elongation appears to be associated with enhanced X-ray\nemission superimposed on the outer radio lobes. There are no obvious\ndepressions in the X-ray emission coincident with the radio lobes, as expected\nif the relativistic plasma displaces the ICM. However, we show that these\ndepressions may be quite weak. From the surface brightness profile for the PSPC\ndata the X-ray emission extends out to ~ 2.2 Mpc radius.

We concentrate\non chemical evolution models for the Milky Way, because of the large number of\ngood observational constraints. Such chemical evolution models have already\nruled out significant temporal variations for the stellar initial mass function\nin our own Galaxy, with the exception perhaps of the very early phases of its\nevolution. Therefore, here we assume a Galactic initial mass function constant\nin time. Through an accurate comparison of model predictions for the Milky Way\nwith carefully selected data sets, it is shown that specific prescriptions for\nthe initial mass function in particular mass ranges should be rejected.

The WMAP estimator is based\non the implicit assumption that the CMB bispectrum, the harmonic transform of\nthe three-point correlation function, contains all of the primordial\nnon-Gaussianity information in a CMB map.

Analytical Formulations Abstract: This paper provides a handy tool to compute the impact of Type Ia Supernova\n(SNIa) on the evolution of stellar systems. An effective formalism is presented\nto couple the SNIa rate to the star formation history, which rests upon the\ndefinition of two key properties of the progenitor's model: the realization\nprobability of the SNIa event from a single stellar generation and the\ndistribution function of the delay times. It is shown that the current SNIa\nrate in late type galaxies implies that the realization probability is on the\norder of 0.001. Analytical formulations for the distribution function of the\ndelay times for Single (SD) and Double Degenerate (DD) progenitors are derived,\nbased on stellar evolution arguments. These formulations, which agree well with\nthe results of Monte Carlo simulations for the evolution of close binaries,\nhave a built in parametrization of the key properties of the alternative\ncandidates.

Our long-slit spectroscopy yields\nestimates of star formation rates in environments from cluster cores to the\ngeneral large-scale structure. The fraction of galaxies with current star\nformation in their inner disks as traced by H-alpha emission increases with\ndistance from the cluster and converges to the ``field'' value only at 2-3\nvirial radii, in agreement with other investigations. However, among galaxies\nwith significant current star formation (EW[Ha]geq2\\AA), there is no difference\nin the distribution of EW[Ha] inside and outside the virial radius. This\nsurprising result, first seen by Carter et al., suggests that (1) star\nformation is truncated on either very short timescales or only at moderate and\nhigh redshifts or (2) that projection effects contaminate the measurement.

We find that colours of\ngalaxies, especially those of faint galaxies ($M_V>M_V^*+1$), change from blue\nto red at a break density as we go to denser regions. Based on local and global\ndensities of galaxies, we classify three environments: field, groups, and\nclusters. We show that the cluster colour-magnitude relation is already built\nat $z=0.83$. In contrast to this, the bright-end of the field colour-magnitude\nrelation has been vigorously built all the way down to the present-day and the\nbuild-up at the faint-end has not started yet.

Such a star\ncluster would sink toward the center of the galaxy, and at the same time stars\nare stripped out of the cluster by the tidal field of the parent galaxy. We\ninvestigated the orbital evolution of the IMBH, after its parent cluster is\ncompletely disrupted by the tidal field of the parent galaxy, by means of\nlarge-scale N-body simulations. We constructed a model of the central region of\nour galaxy, with an SMBH (supermassive black hole) and Bahcall-Wolf stellar\ncusp, and placed an IMBH in a circular orbit of radius 0.086pc. The IMBH sinks\ntoward the SMBH through dynamical friction, but dynamical friction becomes\nineffective when the IMBH reached the radius inside which the initial stellar\nmass is comparable to the IMBH mass. This is because the IMBH kicks out the\nstars. This behavior is essentially the same as the loss-cone depletion\nobserved in simulations of massive SMBH binaries.

Abstract: CONTEXT.The mass assembly is believed to be the dominant process of early\ngalaxy formation. This mechanism of galaxy building can proceed either by\nrepeated major mergers with other systems, or by means of accretion of matter\nfrom the surrounding regions. AIMS.In this paper we compare the properties of\nlocal disk galaxies that appear isolated, i.e. not tidally affected by other\ngalaxies during the last few Gyr within the volume given by cz<= 5000 km/s,\nwith those galaxies at z values from 0.25 to 5.\n  METHODS.Effective radii for 203 isolated galaxies and 1645 galaxies from the\nRC3 have been collected and the two samples have been analyzed statistically. A\nsimilar comparison has been made with half light radii studied at high z from\nthe literature.\n  RESULTS.We found that isolated galaxies are in general smaller than other\npresent epoch galaxies from the RC3. We notice the lack of systems larger than\n7 kpc among them. Their size distribution appears to be similar to that of\ngalaxies at 1.4 <= z <= 2. The models of the merging history also indicate that\nthe isolated galaxies did stop their merging process at about that redshift,\nevolving passively since then.

For\nthis class of galaxies this was the last significant merging event in their\nlives and have evolved passively since then. This is confirmed by the\nanalytical estimate of the merging fraction with z and by the comparison with\nsizes of distant galaxies. \n\n"}

Theoretical\nexpectations are derived from a polytropic model of the intracluster medium and\ncompared with the results of high-resolution adiabatic gasdynamical\nsimulations. It is shown that, in addition to the well-known relation between\nthe mass and concentration of the dark matter halo, the effective polytropic\nindex of the gas also varies systematically with cluster mass, and therefore\nneither the dark matter nor the gas profiles are exactly self-similar.

The radio emission occurs on three different spatial scales, from ~7.5\nkpc bubbles to ~1.5 kpc bubbles lying nearly orthogonal to them and a ~1 kpc\nradio jet lying orthogonal to the kpc-scale bubble. To explain the complex\nmorphology, we first consider a scenario in which the radio structures are the\nresult of superwinds ejected by a nuclear starburst. However, recent Spitzer\nobservations of Mrk 6 provide an upper limit to the star formation rate (SFR)\nof ~5.5 M_sun/yr, an estimate much lower than the SFR of ~33 M_sun/yr derived\nassuming that the bubbles are a result of starburst winds energized by\nsupernovae explosions.

They rather seem to reflect the onset (initial burst) of the dominant\nSF episode of galaxies, after which SF gradually declines on Gyr timescales to\nz=0 and forms the bulk of a galaxy's M_*. With decreasing mass, this onset of\nmajor SF shifts to decreasing z for an increasing fraction of galaxies (staged\ngalaxy formation). This process may be an important component of the\n``downsizing'' phenomenon. We find that the predominantly gradual decline of\nSFR (Noeske et al. 2007, this volume) can be reproduced by exponential SF\nhistories (tau models), if less massive galaxies have systematically longer\ne-folding times tau, and a later onset of SF (z_f).

We study this phenomenon within a model consisting of the three ordinary\nneutrinos plus one sterile neutrino that can be motivated by the neutrino\nanomalies and the dark matter problem.

We find that certain\nclasses of near-critical solutions display naked black hole behavior, although\nthey are not truly black holes at all. Finally, we present a numerical\nsimulation illustrating how an incident pulse of matter can induce the\ndynamical collapse of a monopole into an extremal black hole.

{"id": "hep-th/0301138", "contents": "Title: Brane inflation and reheating Abstract: We study inflation and reheating in a brane world model derived from Type IIA\nstring theory. This particular setup is based on a model of string mediated\nsupersymmetry breaking. The inflaton is one of the transverse scalars of a\nD4-brane which has one of its spatial dimensions stretched between two\nNS5-branes, so that it is effectively three-dimensional. This D4-brane is\nattracted to a D6-brane that is separated from the 5-branes by a fixed amount.\nThe potential of the transverse scalar due to the D4/D6 interaction makes a\ngood inflaton potential. As the D4-brane slides along the two 5-branes towards\nthe 6-brane it begins to oscillate near the minimum of the potential. The\ninflaton field couples to the massless Standard Model fields through Yukawa\ncouplings. In the brane picture these couplings are introduced by having\nanother D6'-brane intersect the D4-brane such that the 4-6' strings, whose\nlowest lying modes are the Standard Model matter, couple to the scalar mode of\nthe 4-4 strings, the inflaton. The inflaton can decay into scalar and spinor\nparticles on the 4-6' strings, reheating the universe. Observational data is\nused to place constraints on the parameters of the model. \n\n"}

It requires\nboth high energy and low energy inflation, with energy densities differing by a\nhundred orders of magnitude. The questions of why the universe started out\nundergoing high energy inflation, and why it will end up in low energy\ninflation, are unanswered. Rather than resort to anthropic arguments, we have\ndeveloped an alternative cosmology, the Cyclic universe, in which the universe\nexists in a very long-lived attractor state determined by the laws of physics.\nThe model shares inflation's phenomenological successes without requiring an\nepoch of high energy inflation. Instead, the universe is made homogeneous and\nflat, and scale-invariant adiabatic perturbations are generated during an epoch\nof low energy acceleration like that seen today, but preceding the last big\nbang. Unlike inflation, the model requires low energy acceleration in order for\na periodic attractor state to exist. The key challenge facing the scenario is\nthat of passing through the cosmic singularity at t=0. Substantial progress has\nbeen made at the level of linearised gravity, which is reviewed here. The\nchallenge of extending this to nonlinear gravity and string theory remains. \n\n"}
