Abstract: When materials such as foams or emulsions are compressed, they display solid\nbehaviour above the so-called `jamming' transition. Because compression is done\nout-of-equilibrium in the absence of thermal fluctuations, jamming appears as a\nnew kind of a nonequilibrium phase transition. In this proceeding paper, we\nsuggest that tools from equilibrium statistical mechanics can in fact be used\nto describe many specific features of the jamming transition. Our strategy is\nto introduce thermal fluctuations and use statistical mechanics to describe the\ncomplex phase behaviour of systems of soft repulsive particles, before sending\ntemperature to zero at the end of the calculation. We show that currently\navailable implementations of standard tools such as integral equations,\nmode-coupling theory, or replica calculations all break down at low temperature\nand large density, but we suggest that new analytical schemes can be developed\nto provide a fully microscopic, quantitative description of the jamming\ntransition. \n\n"}

A two-dimensional prescribed-flow framework is used in example\nsimulations presented in the paper with the aim of highlighting the library\nfeatures. The libcloudph++ and all its mandatory dependencies are free and\nopen-source software. The Boost.units library is used for zero-overhead\ndimensional analysis of the code at compile time. The particle-based scheme is\nimplemented using the Thrust library that allows to leverage the power of\ngraphics processing units (GPU), retaining the possibility to compile the\nunchanged code for execution on single or multiple standard processors (CPUs).\nThe paper includes complete description of the programming interface (API) of\nthe library and a performance analysis including comparison of GPU and CPU\nsetups. \n\n"}

In contrast to the common Fourier transform, these waves no longer have\nto be sinusoidal. Physically relevant waveforms are often available for the\nanalysis instead. The details of the transform depend on the waveforms\nunderlying the analysis, which in turn are specified through the implicit\nassumption that the signal is governed by a certain evolution equation. For\nexample, water waves generated by the Korteweg-de Vries equation can be\nexpressed in terms of cnoidal waves. Light waves in optical fiber governed by\nthe nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation (NSE) are another example. Nonlinear\nanalogs of classic problems such as spectral analysis and filtering arise in\nmany applications, with information transmission in optical fiber, as proposed\nby Yousefi and Kschischang, being a very recent one.

In particular, the traditional static\nmultiscale scheme is proved here to be equivalent to a direct homogenization of\nthe principle of minimum potential energy and to hold exactly under a finite\nelement discretization. This perspective provides a unifying variational\nframework for the FE$^2$ method, in the static setting, with Dirichlet or\nNeumann boundary conditions on the representative volume element; and it\ndirectly manifests the approximate duality of the effective strain energy\ndensity obtained with these two types of boundary conditions in the sense of\nLegendre transformation.

It is found that the effects of collision term are\nconsidered in the reconstructions of the cell-interface distribution function\nin both schemes, which explains why they can overcome the time step restriction\nand can give accurate results even as the time step is much larger than the\ncollision time. The difference between the two schemes lies in the treatment of\nthe integral of the collision term, in which the Bardow's scheme uses the\nrectangular rule while the DUGKS uses the trapezoidal rule.

The novel CF-ROM framework consists of two steps: (i) In the\nfirst step, we use explicit ROM spatial filtering of the nonlinear PDE to\nconstruct a filtered ROM. This filtered ROM is low-dimensional, but is not\nclosed (because of the nonlinearity in the given PDE). (ii) In the second step,\nwe use a calibration procedure to close the filtered ROM, i.e., to model the\ninteraction between the resolved and unresolved modes. To this end, we use a\nlinear or quadratic ansatz to model this interaction and close the filtered\nROM. To find the new coefficients in the closed filtered ROM, we solve an\noptimization problem that minimizes the difference between the full order model\ndata and our ansatz. Although we use a fluid dynamics setting to illustrate how\nto construct and use the CF-ROM framework, we emphasize that it is built on\ngeneral ideas of spatial filtering and optimization and is independent of\n(restrictive) phenomenological arguments. Thus, the CF-ROM framework can be\napplied to a wide variety of PDEs. \n\n"}

In order to solve these problems, the\nthermodynamic potentials are derived by means of the Bogoliubov-Valatin\nformalism. The thermodynamic potentials can be obtained by computing the free\nenergy of a gas of quasi-particles, whose energy spectrum is conditional on the\ngap function. However, the nontrivial dependence of the gap on the temperature\njeopardises the validity of the standard thermodynamic relations. In this\narticle it is shown how the thermodynamic consistency (i.e. the validity of the\nMaxwell relations) is recovered, and the correction terms to the\nquasi-particles potentials are computed.

Taking the form of stochastic\nevolution in a manifold of non-orthogonal Slater determinants, the method\nresembles an ensemble of density-functional theory (DFT) calculations in the\npresence of fluctuating external potentials. Its computational cost scales as a\nlow-power of system size, similar to the corresponding independent-electron\ncalculations. Highly efficient and intrinsically parallel, AFQMC is able to\ntake full advantage of contemporary high-performance computing platforms and\nnumerical libraries. In this review, we provide a self-contained introduction\nto the exact and constrained variants of AFQMC, with emphasis on its\napplications to the electronic structure in molecular systems. Representative\nresults are presented, and theoretical foundations and implementation details\nof the method are discussed. \n\n"}

The new method is conservative for mass, momentum\nand total energy and in multiple space dimensions it is constructed in such a\nway as to respect the divergence-free condition of the magnetic field exactly,\nalso in the presence of resistive effects. This is possible via the use of\nmulti-dimensional Riemann solvers on an appropriately staggered grid for the\ntime evolution of the magnetic field and a double curl formulation of the\nresistive terms.

Once all channels are\nblocked no additional particle can enter the system. If the blockages are of\nfinite duration, however, the system reaches a steady state with an exiting\nflux that is reduced compared to the incoming one. We propose a stochastic\nmodel consisting of $N_c$ channels each with a blocking threshold of $N$\nparticles. Particles enter the system according to a Poisson process with the\nentering flux of intensity $\\Lambda$ equally distributed over the open\nchannels. Any particle in an open channel exits at a rate $\\mu$ and a blocked\nchannel unblocks at a rate $\\mu^*$. We present a method to obtain the exiting\nflux in the steady state, and other properties, for arbitrary $N_c$ and $N$ and\nwe present explicit solutions for $N_c=2,3$.

Using recent\nresults in stochastic thermodynamics, we formulate the cost as the mutual\ninformation between the environment and the stochastic response.

To improve the situation, we have developed a framework, called FDPS,\nwhich enables researchers to easily develop massively parallel particle\nsimulation codes for arbitrary particle methods. Until version 3.0, FDPS have\nprovided API only for C++ programing language. This limitation comes from the\nfact that FDPS is developed using the template feature in C++, which is\nessential to support arbitrary data types of particle. However, there are many\nresearchers who use Fortran to develop their codes. Thus, the previous versions\nof FDPS require such people to invest much time to learn C++. This is\ninefficient. To cope with this problem, we newly developed a Fortran interface\nlayer in FDPS, which provides API for Fortran.

And, (ii) why do they\nsuccessfully predict under-resolved turbulent flows even without a\nsubgrid-scale model? The answer to these two questions can in turn provide\ncrucial guidelines to construct more robust and accurate schemes for complex\nunder-resolved flows, commonly found in industrial applications. For\nillustration purposes, this analysis technique is applied to the hybridized\ndiscontinuous Galerkin methods as representatives of spectral element methods.\nThe effect of the polynomial order, the upwinding parameter and the P\\'eclet\nnumber on the so-called \\textit{short-term diffusion} of the scheme are\ninvestigated. From a purely non-modal analysis point of view, polynomial orders\nbetween $2$ and $4$ with standard upwinding are well suited for under-resolved\nturbulence simulations. For lower polynomial orders, diffusion is introduced in\nscales that are much larger than the grid resolution. For higher polynomial\norders, as well as for strong under/over-upwinding, robustness issues can be\nexpected. The non-modal analysis results are then tested against under-resolved\nturbulence simulations of the Burgers, Euler and Navier-Stokes equations. While\ndevised in the linear setting, our non-modal analysis succeeds to predict the\nbehavior of the scheme in the nonlinear problems considered. \n\n"}

The dynamics of small grains\nin the disc is stiffly coupled to the gas, while the dynamics of grown solids\nis decoupled. Moreover, in some parts of the disc the concentration of the dust\nis low (dust to gas mass ratio is about 0.01), while in other parts it can be\nmuch higher. These factors place high requirements on the numerical methods for\ndisc simulations. In particular, when gas and dust are simulated with two\ndifferent fluids, explicit methods require very small timestep (must be less\nthan dust stopping time $t_{\\rm stop}$ during which the velocity of a solid\nparticle is equalized with respect to the gas velocity) to obtain solution,\nwhile some implicit methods requires high temporal resolution to obtain\nacceptable accuracy. Moreover, recent studies underlined that for Smoothed\nparticle hydrodynamics (SPH) when the gas and the dust are simulated with\ndifferent sets of particles only high spatial resolution $h<c_{\\rm s} t_{\\rm\nstop}$ guaranties suppression of numerical overdissipation due to gas and dust\ninteraction.\n  To address these problems, we developed a fast algorithm based on the ideas\nof (1) implicit integration of linear (Epstein) drag and (2) exact conservation\nof local linear momentum.

For strongly\ndissipative dynamics, there is a wide range of forces where the dissipation\ndominates and the velocity--force characteristics takes the form\n$v\\propto\\exp[-S(f)/\\hbar]$, with $S(f)\\propto 1/ f^{(d+2\\zeta)/(2-\\zeta)}$ the\naction for a typical tunneling event, the force dependence being determined by\nthe roughness exponent $\\zeta$ of the $d$-dimensional manifold. This result\nagrees with the one obtained via simple scaling considerations. Surprisingly,\nfor asymptotically low forces or for the case when the massive dynamics is\ndominant, the resulting quantum creep law is {\\it not} of the usual form with a\nrate proportional to $\\exp[-S(f)/\\hbar]$; rather we find $v\\propto\n\\exp\\{-[S(f)/\\hbar]^2\\}$ corresponding to $\\alpha=2$ and $\\mu=\n2(d+2\\zeta-1)/(2-\\zeta)$, with $\\mu/2$ the naive scaling exponent for massive\ndynamics.

I\ndescribe how, with the discovery of new classes of collective order, the\nunfolding puzzles of high temperature superconductivity and quantum\ncriticality, the prospects for major conceptual discoveries remain as bright\ntoday as they were more than half a century ago. \n\n"}

It is\nexplained in the present paper why the only first order phase transition\nobserved on the way from the Abrikosov state in the normal state should be\ninterpreted as phase coherence disappearance. The false concept of vortex\nlattice melting appeared because of some causes main of them are erroneous\ninterpretation of direct observation of the Abrikosov state and the use by\ntheorists the habitual determination of phase coherence invalid for\nmulti-connected superconducting state. The distinguished work by A.A.

It is strange that most scientists have lightly admitted that this\nprediction corresponds to the facts. The long-rang order of superconducting\nstate is phase coherence. Therefore if the Abrikosov state is also the vortex\nlattice then it have two long-rang orders and two phase transition may be\nexpected. But only phase transition is assumed and observed always.

This is so even for normal macroscopic systems with short-range\ncoupling. As inhomogeneities and surface effects in particular cannot be scaled\naway,one has to be careful with the standard arguments of splitting a system\ninto two or bringing two systems into thermal contact.

To fit the data, a stretched exponential ($N(x) \\propto\n\\exp{-(x/x_0)^{\\beta}}$) has been used with only partial success. The success\nis not complete because the data exhibit, for large citation count $x$, a power\nlaw (roughly $N(x) \\propto x^{-3}$ for the ISI data), which, clearly, the\nstretched exponential does not reproduce. This fact is then attributed to a\npossibly different nature of rarely cited and largely cited papers.

The phase diagram of the BHM indicates a phase transition from a\nMott insulator to a compressibile superfluid phase, and shows the expected\nlobe-like structure. The SHM phase diagram displays a quantum phase transition\nbetween a paramagnetic and a canted phases showing as well a lobe-like\nstructure.

The resulting coarse-grained CA that we construct are\ncapable of emulating the large-scale behavior of the original systems without\naccounting for small-scale details. Several CA that can be coarse-grained by\nthis construction are known to be universal Turing machines; they can emulate\nany CA or other computing devices and are therefore undecidable. We thus show\nthat because in practice one only seeks coarse-grained information, complex\nphysical systems can be predictable and even decidable at some level of\ndescription.

The approximation is based on an\nexponential ansatz of the transition probability for a finite time step $\\Delta\nt$, and a series expansion of the deviation of its logarithm from that of a\nGaussian distribution. Through this procedure, dubbed {\\em exponent expansion},\nthe transition probability is obtained as a power series in $\\Delta t$. This\nbecomes asymptotically exact if an increasing number of terms is included, and\nprovides remarkably accurate results even when truncated to the first few (say\n3) terms. The coefficients of such expansion can be determined\nstraightforwardly through a recursion, and involve simple one-dimensional\nintegrals.\n  We present several examples of financial interest, and we compare our results\nwith the state-of-the-art approximation of discretely sampled diffusions\n[A\\\"it-Sahalia, {\\it Journal of Finance} {\\bf 54}, 1361 (1999)]. We find that\nthe exponent expansion provides a similar accuracy in most of the cases, but a\nbetter behavior in the low-volatility regime. Furthermore the implementation of\nthe present approach turns out to be simpler.\n  Within the functional integration framework the exponent expansion allows one\nto obtain remarkably good approximations of the pricing kernels of financial\nderivatives. This is illustrated with the application to simple path-dependent\ninterest rate derivatives. Finally we discuss how these results can also be\nused to increase the efficiency of numerical (both deterministic and\nstochastic) approaches to derivative pricing. \n\n"}

This area law is rigorously proven to hold true in non-critical\nharmonic lattice system of arbitrary spatial dimension, for general\nfinite-ranged harmonic interactions, regions of arbitrary shape and states of\nnonzero temperature. For nearest-neighbor interactions - corresponding to the\nKlein-Gordon case - upper and lower bounds to the degree of entanglement can be\nstated explicitly for arbitrarily shaped regions, generalizing the findings of\n[Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 060503 (2005)]. These higher dimensional analogues of the\nanalysis of block entropies in the one-dimensional case show that under general\nconditions, one can expect an area law for the entanglement in non-critical\nharmonic many-body systems. The proofs make use of methods from entanglement\ntheory, as well as of results on matrix functions of block banded matrices.\nDisordered systems are also considered. We moreover construct a class of\nexamples for which the two-point correlation length diverges, yet still an area\nlaw can be proven to hold. We finally consider the scaling of classical\ncorrelations in a classical harmonic system and relate it to a quantum lattice\nsystem with a modified interaction. We briefly comment on a general\nrelationship between criticality and area laws for the entropy of entanglement. \n\n"}
