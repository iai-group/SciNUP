Some theoretical\nestimates for the cores of relaxed clusters predict an excess of helium\nabundance by up to a factor of a few over its primordial value. The\nintracluster helium abundance cannot be measured directly. This presents a\nsignificant source of uncertainty for cosmological tests based on the X-ray\nderived cluster quantities, such as the gas mass, total mass, and gas mass\nfraction, all of which depend on the assumed helium abundance. We point out\nthat cluster distances derived by combining the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) and\nX-ray data also depend on the helium abundance. This dependence can be used to\nmeasure the abundance, provided the distance is known independently. For\nexample, if one adopts the WMAP H_0 value, then the recent H_0 measurement by\nBonamente and collaborators, derived from SZ data on 38 clusters assuming a\nprimordial helium abundance, corresponds to an abundance excess by a factor of\n1.9+-0.8 within r~1 Mpc (using only their statistical errors). This shows that\ninteresting accuracy is within reach.

This is the most important energy range for absorbing $\\g$-rays from\ndistant sources such as blazars and gamma-ray bursts and producing electron\npositron pairs. In previous work we presented EBL models in the optical through\nultraviolet by consistently taking into account the star formation rate (SFR),\ninitial mass function (IMF) and dust extinction, and treating stars on the main\nsequence as blackbodies. This technique is extended to include post-main\nsequence stars and reprocessing of starlight by dust. In our simple model, the\ntotal energy absorbed by dust is assumed to be re-emitted as three blackbodies\nin the infrared, one at 40 K representing warm, large dust grains, one at 70 K\nrepresenting hot, small dust grains, and one at 450 K representing polycyclic\naromatic hydrocarbons.

Based on a\nconsideration of the coupling of the r-modes and the stellar spin and thermal\nevolutions, we carefully investigate the influences of the r-mode-induced\ndifferential rotation on the long-term evolutions of isolated NSs and NSs in\nlow-mass X-ray binaries, where the viscous damping of the r-modes and its\nresultant effects are taken into account.

The theory of\ngravitational aether is an alternative to general relativity that does not\nsuffer from this fine-tuning problem, as it decouples the quantum field theory\nvacuum from geometry, while remaining consistent with other tests of gravity.\nIn this paper, we study static black hole solutions in this theory and show\nthat it manifests a UV-IR coupling: Aether couples the spacetime metric close\nto the black hole horizon, to metric at infinity.

This disk forms powerful jets and consists of thin spiral\naccretion streams of a dense optically thick plasma surrounded by hot,\nmagnetized, optically thin corona, which emits most of the energy in hard\nX-rays. State transition occurs because of the quasi-periodic or random\ninversion of poloidal magnetic fields in the accretion flow supplied by the\nsecondary star.

In the super-spinning case, for $|a|$ moderately larger than\n$M$, the accretion onto the central object is extremely suppressed due to a\nrepulsive force at short distance. The accreting matter cannot reach the\ncentral object, but instead is accumulated around it, forming a high density\ncloud that continues to grow. The radiation emitted in the accretion process\nwill be harder and more intense than the one coming from standard black holes;\ne.g. $\\gamma$-rays could be produced as seen in some observations.\nGravitational collapse of this cloud might even give rise to violent bursts.

Diversity of events at low and high\n  redshift Abstract: This paper investigates on the possible systematic difference of Supernovae\nIa (SN Ia) properties related to the age and masses of the progenitors that\ncould introduce a systematic bias between low and high redshift SN Ia's. The\nrelation between the main features of the distribution of the delay times (DTD)\nand the masses of the progenitors is illustrated for the single (SD) and double\ndegenerate (DD) models. Mixed models, which assume contributions from both the\nSD and DD channels, are also presented and tested versus the observed\ncorrelations between the SN Ia rates and the parent galaxy properties. It is\nshown that these correlations can be accounted for with both single channel and\nmixed models, and that the rate in S0 and E galaxies may effectively provide\nclues on the contribution of SD progenitors to late epoch explosions. A wide\nrange of masses for the CO WD at the start of accretion is expected in almost\nall galaxy types; only in galaxies of the earliest types the properties of the\nprogenitors are expected to be more uniform.

We estimate the mass accretion rate and\ngrowth timescale of gas giant planets. The mass accretion rate increases with\nprotoplanet mass for M_p < M_cri, while it becomes saturated or decreases for\nM_p > M_cri, where M_cri = 0.036 M_Jup (a_p/1AU)^0.75, and M_Jup and a_p are\nthe Jovian mass and the orbital radius, respectively.

We identify significant\nsystematic effects in this procedure that can artificially induce an additional\ndiffuse component with a morphology strikingly similar to the claimed gamma-ray\nhaze. To quantitatively illustrate this point we calculate sky-maps of the\nratio of the gamma-ray emission from neutral pions to the ISM column density,\nand of IC to synchrotron emission, using detailed galactic cosmic-ray models\nand simulations. In the region above and below the galactic center, the ISM\ntemplate underestimates the gamma-ray emission due to neutral pion decay by\napproximately 20%. Additionally, the synchrotron template tends to\nunder-estimate the IC emission at low energies (few GeV) and to over-estimate\nit at higher energies (tens of GeV) by potentially large factors that depend\ncrucially on the assumed magnetic field structure of the Galaxy. The size of\nthe systematic effects we find are comparable to the size of the claimed \"Fermi\nhaze\" signal.

The exact shape of the ejecta is modelled and\nwe find that an elongated triaxial ellipsoid fits the observations best. From\nour spectral analyses of the ejecta spectrum we find that most of the He I, [Si\nI] and [Fe I-II] emission originates in the core material which has undergone\nexplosive nucleosynthesis.

Most of the precise NS mass measurements that have been made to\ndate show values close to 1.4 solar masses, but a reliable measurement of an\nover-massive NS would constrain the EOS possibilities.

The evolving, overall spectrum of the\nEBL is derived here utilizing a novel method based on observations only. This\nis achieved from the observed evolution of the rest-frame K-band galaxy\nluminosity function up to redshift 4 (Cirasuolo et al. 2010), combined with a\ndetermination of galaxy SED-type fractions. These are based on fitting SWIRE\ntemplates to a multiwavelength sample of about 6000 galaxies in the redshift\nrange from 0.2 to 1 from the All-wavelength Extended Groth Strip International\nSurvey (AEGIS). The changing fractions of quiescent galaxies, star-forming\ngalaxies, starburst galaxies and AGN galaxies in that redshift range are\nestimated, and two alternative extrapolations of SED-types to higher redshifts\nare considered.

How does this accord with the use of single\nparticle distribution functions in the kinetic equations? When can these\neffects be parametrised in an effective description in terms of quasiparticles?\nAnd what is the kinematic role of their thermal masses? We address these\nquestions in the framework of nonequilibrium quantum field theory and develop\nan intuitive picture in which contributions from higher order processes are\nparametrised by the widths of resonances in the plasma. In the narrow width\nlimit we recover the quasiparticle picture, with the additional processes\ngiving rise to off-shell parts of quasiparticle propagators that appear to\nviolate energy conservation.

First, the binary lens is bright enough (I=15.6) to permit\nDoppler measurements. Second, we measure not only the usual 7 binary-lens\nparameters, but also the 'microlens parallax' (which yields the binary mass)\nand two components of the instantaneous orbital velocity.

Abstract: Observations with the Swift satellite of X-ray afterglows of more than a\nhundred gamma ray bursts (GRBs) with known redshift reveal ubiquitous soft\nX-ray absorption. The directly measured optical depth \\tau at a given observed\nenergy is found to be constant on average at redshift z > 2, i.e., <\\tau (0.5\nkeV) >_{z > 2} = 0.40+/- 0.02. Such an asymptotic optical depth is expected if\nthe foreground diffuse intergalactic medium (IGM) dominates the absorption\neffect, and if the metallicity of the diffuse IGM reaches ~ 0.2 - 0.4 solar at\nz = 0. To further test the IGM absorption hypothesis, we analyze the 12 highest\nS/N (> 5000 photon) z > 2 quasar spectra from the XMM-Newton archive, which are\nall extremely radio loud (RLQs). The quasar optical depths are found to be\nconsistent with the mean GRB value. The four lowest-z quasars (2 < z < 2.5),\nhowever, do not show significant absorption. The best X-ray spectra of\nradio-quiet quasars (RQQs) at z > 2 provide only upper limits to the\nabsorption, which are still consistent with the RLQs, albeit with much lower\nS/N (< 1000 photons at z ~ 4). Lack of quasar absorption poses a challenge to\nthe smooth IGM interpretation, and could allude to the opacity being rather due\nto the jets in RLQs and GRBs. However, the jet absorbing column would need to\nappear in RLQs only at z > 2.5, and in GRBs to strongly increase with z in\norder to produce the observed tendency to a constant mean \\tau. High X-ray\nspectral resolution can differentiate between an absorber intrinsic to the\nsource that produces discernible spectral lines, and the diffuse IGM that\nproduces significant absorption, but no discrete features. \n\n"}

We present results\nfrom our latest semi-analytic models (SAMs), which employ the main ingredients\nthought to be important to galaxy formation and evolution, as well as an\nimproved model for reprocessing of starlight by dust to mid- and far-IR\nwavelengths. These SAMs are based upon a Lambda-CDM hierarchical structural\nformation scenario, and are successful in reproducing a large variety of\nobservational constraints such as number counts, luminosity and mass functions,\nand color bimodality. Our fiducial model is based upon a WMAP5 cosmology, and\ntreats dust emission using empirical templates. This model predicts a\nbackground flux considerably lower than optical and near-IR measurements that\nrely on subtraction of zodiacal and galactic foregrounds, and near the lower\nbounds set by number counts of resolvable sources at a large number of\nwavelengths. We also show the results of varying cosmological parameters and\ndust attenuation model used in our SAM. For each EBL prediction, we show how\nthe optical depth due to electron-positron pair-production is affected by\nredshift and gamma-ray energy, and the effect of gamma-ray absorption on the\nspectra of a variety of extragalactic sources. We conclude with a discussion of\nthe implications of our work, comparisons to other models and key measurements\nof the EBL and a discussion of how the burgeoning science of gamma-ray\nastronomy will continue to help constrain cosmology.

Here we demonstrate that the OIR colour-magnitude\ndiagrams (CMDs) of the evolution of the X-ray transient XTE J1550-564 in\noutburst can be used to separate the disc from the jet. Monitoring in two\nwavebands is all that is required. This outburst in 2000 was well studied, and\nboth disc and jet were known to contribute. During the outburst the data follow\na well defined path in the CMD, describing what would be expected from a heated\nsingle-temperature blackbody of approximately constant area, except when the\ndata appear redder than this track. This is due to the non-thermal jet\ncomponent which dominates the OIR moreso during hard X-ray states at high\nluminosities, and which is quenched in the soft state. The CMD therefore shows\nstate-dependent hysteresis, in analogy with (but not identical to) the well\nestablished X-ray hardness-intensity diagram of black hole transients. The\nblackbody originates in the X-ray illuminated, likely unwarped, outer accretion\ndisc.

To determine the large frequency separation as accurately\nas possible a mean large frequency separation computed over several orders is\noften used. It is, however, known that the large frequency separation varies\nwith frequency in a second order effect. From observations it has been shown\nthat this frequency dependence is more important for main-sequence stars than\nit is for red-giant stars. Here we use YREC models to verify and explain this\nobservational result. We find that for stars with R > 8 Rsun the effect of the\nHelium second ionisation zone is relatively small. For these stars the deep\nlocation of the He II zone induces a frequency modulation covering only a few\nlarge separations, while the amplitude of the modulation is low due to the\nrelatively weak and extended He II layer, causing a shallow wide depression in\nthe first adiabatic exponent. For less evolved stars the He II zone is located\ncloser to the surface, and it is more confined, i.e. a deep narrow depression\nin the first adiabatic exponent. This causes frequency modulations with\nrelatively high amplitudes covering up to about 20 large separations, inducing\na relatively large frequency modulation. Additionally, we find that for less\nevolved stars the He II zone is stronger and more localised for more massive\nstars and for stars with low metallicities further increasing the amplitude of\nthe frequency modulation. \n\n"}

However a major uncertainty is the estimate of the orbital\ninclination angle of an X-ray binary. Here we suggest to measure the black hole\nmass in an X-ray binary by measuring directly the black hole's orbital motion,\nthus obtaining the companion to black hole mass ratio. In this method we assume\nthat accretion disk wind moves with the black hole and thus the black hole's\norbital motion can be obtained from the Doppler velocity of the absorption\nlines produced in the accretion disk wind. We validate this method by analyzing\nthe Chandra/HETG observations of GRO J1655-40, in which the black hole orbital\nmotion with line of sight velocity of 90.8 (+-11.3) km/s, inferred from the\nDoppler velocity of disk-wind absorption lines, is consistent with the\nprediction from its previously measured system parameters. We obtain the black\nhole mass of 5.41 (+0.98, -0.57) solar masses and system inclination of 72.0\n(+7.8, -7.5) degrees in GRO J1655-40. Additional observations of this source\ncovering more orbital phases can improve estimates on its system parameters\nsubstantially. We then apply the method to the black hole X-ray binary LMC X-3\nobserved with HST/COS near orbital phase 0.75. We find that the disk-wind\nabsorption lines of CIV doublet were shifted to about 50 km/s, which yields a\ncompanion-to-black-hole mass ratio of 0.6 for an assumed disk wind velocity of\n-400 km/s. Additional observations covering other orbital phases (0.25 in\nparticular) are crucial to ease this assumption and then to directly constrain\nthe mass ratio.

The observed\npolarization is lower than the Milne value in a non-magnetized atmosphere. We\nhypothesize that the polarized radiation escapes from optically thick\nmagnetized accretion discs and is weakened by the Faraday rotation effect. This\neffect is able to explain both the value of the polarization and the position\nangle. We estimate the required magnetic field in the broad line region by\nusing simple asymptotic analytical formulas for Milne's problem in magnetized\natmosphere, which take into account the last scattering of radiation before\nescaping from the accretion disc. The polarization of a broad spectral line\nescaping from disc is described by the same mechanism. The characteristic\nfeatures of polarization of a broad line is the minimum of the degree of\npolarization in the center of the line and continuous rotation of the position\nangle from one wing to another. These effects can be explained by existence of\nclouds in the left (velocity is directed to an observer) and the right\n(velocity is directed from an observer) parts of the orbit in a rotating\nkeplerian magnetized accretion disc. The base of explanation is existence of\nazimuthal magnetic field in the orbit. The existence of normal component of\nmagnetic field makes the picture of polarization asymmetric.

For benchmark model\nparameters (e.g. the bulk Lorentz factor is \\Gamma=10^{2.5}, the observed\nvariability time for long GRBs is t_v=0.01 s and the ratio between the energy\nin accelerated protons and in radiation is \\eta_p=10 for every burst) in the\nstandard internal shock scenario, the predicted neutrino flux from 215 bursts\nduring the period of the 40-string and 59-string configurations is found to be\na factor of ~3 below the IceCube sensitivity. However, if we accept the\nrecently found inherent relation between the bulk Lorentz factor and burst\nenergy, the expected neutrino flux increases significantly and the spectral\npeak shifts to lower energy. In this case, the non-detection then implies that\nthe baryon loading ratio should be \\eta_p<10 if the variability time of long\nGRBs is fixed to t_v=0.01 s.

We show that cooling of high-velocity,\nshocked winds in AGN is in fact inefficient in a wide range of circumstances,\nincluding conditions relevant to ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs),\nresulting in energy-conserving outflows. We further show that fast\nenergy-conserving outflows can tolerate a large amount of mixing with cooler\ngas before radiative losses become important. For winds with initial velocity\nv_in>~10,000 km s^-1, as observed in ultra-violet and X-ray absorption, the\nshocked wind develops a two-temperature structure. While most of the thermal\npressure support is provided by the protons, the cooling processes operate\ndirectly only on the electrons. This significantly slows down inverse Compton\ncooling, while free free cooling is negligible. Slower winds with v_in~1,000 km\ns^-1, such as may be driven by radiation pressure on dust, can also experience\nenergy-conserving phases but under more restrictive conditions.

Moreover, galaxies hosting GRBs with no optical/NIR afterglows, whose\nidentification therefore relies on X-ray localizations, are significantly\nbrighter and redder than those with an optical/NIR afterglow. Our spectroscopic\ncampaign has resulted in 77 % now having redshift measurements, with a median\nredshift of 2.14 +- 0.18. TOUGH alone includes 17 detected z > 2 Swift GRB host\ngalaxies suitable for individual and statistical studies. Seven hosts have\ndetections of the Ly-alpha emission line and we can exclude an early indication\nthat Ly-alpha emission is ubiquitous among GRB hosts, but confirm that Ly-alpha\nis stronger in GRB-selected galaxies than in flux-limited samples of Lyman\nbreak galaxies. \n\n"}

In this paper, we\npresent a detailed calculation of the time delay between the MeV and GeV\nphotons in the framework of the magnetic-dominated jet model.

Another interesting result is that, for long bursts,\nGeV photons are emitted after the bulk Lorentz factor saturates.

Within the Fireshell model [...] we predict\ngenuine short GRBs: bursts with the same inner engine of the long bursts but\nendowed with a severely low value of the Baryon load, B<~5x10^{-5}.

This result has important theoretical and observational\nimplications. However, because of technical difficulties, the radial dynamic\nrange in almost all previous simulations usually spans at most two orders of\nmagnitude. This small dynamical range, combined with the effects of boundary\nconditions, makes the simulation results suspectable. Especially, the radial\nprofiles of density and accretion rate may not be precise enough to be used to\ncompare with observations. In this paper we present a \"two-zone\" approach to\nexpand the radial dynamical range from two to four orders of magnitude. We\nconfirm previous results and find that from $r_s$ to $ 10^4r_s$ the radial\nprofiles of accretion rate and density can be well described by\n$\\dot{M}(r)\\propto r^s$ and $\\rho\\propto r^{-p}$.

The gas in\nthese galaxies is not in perfect hydrostatic equilibrium. Supernova feedback,\nstellar winds, or active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback can significantly\nperturb the interstellar medium (ISM). Using hydrodynamical simulations, we\ninvestigate the effect of subsonic turbulence in the hot ISM on the ram\npressure stripping process in early-type galaxies. We find that galaxies with\nmore turbulent ISM produce longer, wider, and more smoothly distributed tails\nof the stripped ISM than those characterised by weaker ISM turbulence. Our main\nconclusion is that even very weak internal turbulence, at the level of <15% of\nthe average ISM sound speed, can significantly accelerate the gas removal from\ngalaxies via ram pressure stripping. The magnitude of this effect increases\nsharply with the strength of turbulence. As most of the gas stripping takes\nplace near the boundary between the ISM and the intraclustermedium (ICM), the\nboost in the ISM stripping rate is due to the \"random walk\" of the ISM from the\ncentral regions of the galactic potential well to larger distances, where the\nram pressure is able to permanently remove the gas from galaxies. The ICM can\nbe temporarily trapped inside the galactic potential well due to the mixing of\nthe turbulent ISM with the ICM. The galaxies with more turbulent ISM, yet still\ncharacterised by very weak turbulence, can hold larger amounts of the ICM.\n[Abridged] \n\n"}

In this paper, we focus our attention\non the possible absence of angular correlation in the CMB anisotropies at\nangles larger than ~60 degrees, and consider whether this feature may be the\nsignature of fluctuations expected in the R_h=ct Universe. We calculate the CMB\nangular correlation function for a fluctuation spectrum expected from growth in\na Universe whose dynamics is constrained by the equation-of-state p=-rho/3,\nwhere p and rho are the total pressure and density, respectively.

The motion of particles with trajectories close to\nthe curved magnetic lines is usually referred to the so-called curvature\nradiation. The latter is treated within the formalism of synchrotron radiation\nby replacing the particle Larmor radius with the curvature radius of the field\nlines. However, even at small pitch angles, the curvatures of the particle\ntrajectory and the field line may differ significantly. Moreover, as we show in\nthis paper the trajectory curvature varies with time, i.e. the process has a\nstochastic character. Therefore for calculations of observable characteristics\nof radiation by an ensemble of particles, the radiation intensities should be\naveraged over time. In this paper, for determination of particle trajectories\nwe use the Hamiltonian formalism, and show that that close to curved magnetic\nlines, for the given configuration of the magnetic field, the initial point and\nparticle energy, always exist a smooth trajectory without fast oscillations of\nthe curvature radius.

We demonstrate that JEM-EUSO will be able to\nprobe models where the NLSP decays, therefore probing supersymmetric breaking\nscales below $5 \\times 10^6$ GeV. The observatory field of view will be large\nenough to detect a few tens of events per year, depending on its energy\nthreshold. This is complementary to a previous proposal (Albuquerque et al.,\n2004) where it was shown that 1 Km$^3$ neutrino telescopes can directly probe\nthis scale. NLSPs will be produced by the interaction of high energy neutrinos\nin the Earth. Here we investigate scenarios where they subsequently decay,\neither in the atmosphere after escaping the Earth or right before leaving the\nEarth, producing taus.

Abstract: Soft gamma repeaters (SGRs) and anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs) are two groups\nof enigmatic objects, which have been extensively investigated in past few\ndecades. Based on the ample information about their timing behaviors, spectra,\nand variability properties, it was proposed that SGRs/AXPs are isolated neutron\nstars (NSs) with extremely strong magnetic fields, the so-called magnetars.\nNonetheless, some alternative models are probably equally convincing such as\nthose proposing that they are accreting NSs with a fall-back disk or\nrotation-powered magnetized and massive white dwarfs. The nature and nurture of\nSGRs/AXPs remain controversial. In this paper, we propose that SGRs/AXPs can\noriginate from normal NSs in binary systems. SGRs are a class of objects\ncontaining a neutron-drip core and denser crust with a stiffer equation of\nstate, which is formed from re-explosion of normal NSs in binary systems.

Hydrodynamical models show that the cooling\nof a shocked Wolf-Rayet star leads to a much greater difference (> 0.9 dex).\nOur proposed scenario is that of a jet produced during the explosion which\ndeposits 56Ni-rich material in the outer layers of the ejecta. The presence of\nhigh-velocity radioactive material allows us to reproduce the complete\nluminosity evolution of the object. Without outer 56Ni it could be possible to\nreproduce the early emission purely from cooling of the shocked envelope by\nassuming a larger progenitor than a Wolf-Rayet star, but that would require an\ninitial density structure significantly different from what is predicted by\nstellar evolution models.

New observations of\nM87 enable us to put forward a comprehensive model for the physical heating\nmechanism. Low-frequency radio observations by LOFAR revealed the absence of\nfossil cosmic-ray (CR) electrons in the radio halo surrounding M87. This puzzle\ncan be resolved by accounting for the CR release from the radio cocoons and the\nsubsequent mixing of CRs with the dense ambient intracluster gas, which\nthermalizes the electrons on a timescale similar to the radio halo age of 40\nMyr. Hadronic interactions of similarly injected CR protons with the ambient\ngas should produce an observable gamma-ray signal in accordance with the steady\nemission of the low state of M87 detected by Fermi and H.E.S.S. Hence, we\nnormalize the CR population to the gamma-ray emission, which shows the same\nspectral slope as the CR injection spectrum probed by LOFAR, thereby supporting\na common origin. We show that CRs, which stream at the Alfven velocity with\nrespect to the plasma rest frame, heat the surrounding thermal plasma at a rate\nthat balances that of radiative cooling on average at each radius. However, the\nresulting global thermal equilibrium is locally unstable and allows for the\nformation of the observed cooling multi-phase medium through thermal\ninstability.

However, no GRB was detected in\nassociation with the SN. Here, the properties of SN2010ah are determined with\nhigher accuracy than previous studies through modelling. New Subaru telescope\nphotometry is presented. A bolometric light curve is constructed taking\nadvantage of the spectral similarity with SN1998bw. Radiation transport tools\nare used to reproduce the spectra and the light curve. The results thus\nobtained regarding ejecta mass, composition and kinetic energy are then used to\ncompute a synthetic light curve. This is in reasonable agreement with the early\nbolometric light curve of SN2010ah, but a high abundance of 56Ni at high\nvelocity is required to reproduce the early rise, while a dense inner core must\nbe used to reproduce the slow decline at late phases. The high-velocity 56Ni\ncannot have been located on our line of sight, which may be indirect evidence\nfor an off-axis, aspherical explosion. The main properties of SN2010ah are:\nejected mass ~ 3 Mo; kinetic energy ~10^52 erg, M(56Ni) ~ 0.25 Mo. The mass\nlocated at v >~ 0.1c is ~0.2 Mo. Although these values, in particular the\nkinetic energy, are quite large for a SN Ic, they are all smaller (especially\nthe ejecta mass) than those typical of GRB/SNe. This confirms the tendency for\nthese quantities to correlate, and suggests that there are minimum requirements\nfor a GRB/SN, which SN2010ah may not meet although it comes quite close.\nDepending on whether a neutron star or a black hole was formed following core\ncollapse, SN2010ah was the explosion of a CO core of ~ 5-6 Mo, pointing to a\nprogenitor mass of ~24 - 28 Mo. \n\n"}

Based on the low eccentricity and the position within\nthe galactic plane, Piran & Shaviv (2004, 2005) argued that pulsar B had a\nnon-standard formation scenario with little or no mass ejection. They have also\npredicted that the system would have a very slow proper motion. Pulsar timing\nmeasurements (Kramer et al. 2006; Deller et al. 2009) confirmed this\nprediction. The recent observations of the alignment between the spin of pulsar\nA and the binary orbit is also in agreement with this scenario. Detailed\nsimulations of the formation process of pulsar B enable us to show that its\nprogenitor, just before the collapse, was a massive O-Ne-Mg white dwarf\nsurrounded by a tenuous, 0.1-0.16 M_sun, envelope.

Not\nmuch is known about the progenitors of these bursts, but they are\nhighly-energetic, and probably of extragalactic origin. Their properties\nsuggest extreme environments and interesting physics, but in order to\nunderstand and study these events, more examples need to be found. Fortunately,\nthe recent boom in radio astronomy means many 'next-generation' radio\ntelescopes are set to begin observing in the near future.

In our timing analysis, we find that when the source is faint in the\nradio, QPOs are observed above 2 Hz and typically exhibit soft lags (soft\nphotons lag hard photons), whereas QPOs in the radio-bright plateau state are\nfound below 2.2 Hz and consistently show hard lags. The phase lag at the QPO\nfrequency is strongly anti-correlated with the QPO frequency, changing sign at\n2.2 Hz. However, the phase lag at the frequency of the first harmonic is\npositive and nearly independent of frequency at at ~0.172 rad, regardless of\nthe radio emission. The lag-energy dependence at the first harmonic is also\nindependent of radio flux. However, the lags at the QPO frequency are negative\nat all energies during the radio-quiet state, but lags at the QPO frequency\nduring the plateau state are positive at all energies and show a\n'reflection-type' evolution of the lag-energy spectra with respect to the\nradio-quiet state.

Multi-messenger\nastronomy provides a unique opportunity to put limits on the difference (either\npositive or negative) between the propagation speed of electromagnetic and\ngravitational waves from these sources. This paper considers limits from\nmulti-messenger cases across the planned measurable spectrum: first, the limits\nfrom isolated pulsars based on the current best limits from LIGO on\ngravitational wave emission, second, the limits from ultra-compact binaries\nthat will be visible to a low-frequency space-based gravitational wave\nobservatory like LISA, and third, limits from super massive black hole binaries\nusing pulsar timing arrays. The required phase comparison between the\nelectromagnetic signal and the gravitational wave signal is derived and,\nassuming a null result in that comparison, the current bounds on emission are\nused to place limits on alternative theories that exhibit propagation delays.\nObservations of the pulsars in the most sensitive range of LIGO could put an\nupper limit on the graviton mass as low as $10^{-38}\\frac{eV}{c^{2}}$ and an\nupper limit on the fractional difference between the gravitational wave and\nelectromagnetic wave speeds as low as $10^{-9}$.

An established method to measure the\nspin of black holes is via the study of relativistic reflection features from\nthe inner accretion disk. Owing to their greater distances, there has hitherto\nbeen no significant detection of relativistic reflection features in a\nmoderate-redshift quasar. Here, we use archival data together with a new, deep\nobservation of a gravitationally-lensed quasar at $z=0.658$ to rigorously\ndetect and study reflection in this moderate-redshift quasar. The level of\nrelativistic distortion present in this reflection spectrum enables us to\nconstrain the emission to originate within $\\lesssim3$ gravitational radii from\nthe black hole, implying a spin parameter $a=0.87^{+0.08}_{-0.15} $ at the\n$3\\sigma$ level of confidence and $a>0.66$ at the $5\\sigma$ level.

We studied the equilibrium\nstate and the stability conditions of this system that includes one external\nparameter, J, that can be considered a function of the disk accretion rate. Our\nwork is based on observations performed with the MECS on board BeppoSAX when\nthe source was in rho and nu mode, respectively. The evolution of the mean\ncount rate and photon energy were derived from a study of the trajectories in\nthe count rate - photon energy plane.

Under strong electric fields the\nbehavior of the current is similar to that in flat space, while under weak\nelectric fields the current becomes inversely proportional to the mass squared\nof the charged field.

These are composed of a quark core and a\nhadronic shell with a first-order phase transition at their interface. The\nresulting mass-radius relations are in accordance with the latest astrophysical\nconstraints. Methods: The quark matter description is based on a quantum\nchromodynamics (QCD) motivated chiral approach with higher-order quark\ninteractions in the Dirac scalar and vector coupling channels. For hadronic\nmatter we select a relativistic mean-field equation of state with\ndensity-dependent couplings. Since the nucleons are treated in the\nquasi-particle framework, an excluded volume correction has been included for\nthe nuclear equation of state at suprasaturation density which takes into\naccount the finite size of the nucleons. Results: These novel aspects, excluded\nvolume in the hadronic phase and the higher-order repulsive interactions in the\nquark phase, lead to a strong first-order phase transition with large latent\nheat, i.e. the energy-density jump at the phase transition, which fulfils a\ncriterion for a disconnected third-family branch of compact stars in the\nmass-radius relationship.

Solar-like states of differential rotation, arising\nwhen convection is rotationally constrained, are characterized by a very\ndifferent convective Reynolds stress than anti-solar regimes, wherein\nconvection only weakly senses the Coriolis force. We find that the angular\nmomentum transport by convective Reynolds stress plays a central role in\nestablishing the meridional flow profiles in these simulations.

In this paper, we show that the gamma-ray optical depth can be\nreduced to the convolution product of an EBL kernel with the EBL intensity,\nassuming a particular form for the EBL evolution. We extract the absorption\nsignal from the most extensive set of TeV spectra from blazars collected so far\nand unveil a broad-band EBL spectrum from mid-ultraviolet to far infrared. This\nspectrum is in good agreement with the accumulated emission of galaxies,\nconstraining unresolved populations of sources.

We consider the hypothesis that these\ngaps are carved by planets, and present a general framework for understanding\nthe dynamical stability of such systems over typical disk lifetimes, providing\nestimates for the maximum planetary masses. We collect these easily evaluated\nconstraints into a workflow that can help guide the design and interpretation\nof new observational campaigns and numerical simulations of gap opening in such\nsystems. We argue that the locations of resonances should be significantly\nshifted in massive disks like HL Tau, and that theoretical uncertainties in the\nexact offset, together with observational errors, imply a large uncertainty in\nthe dynamical state and stability in such disks. This presents an important\nbarrier to using systems like HL Tau as a proxy for the initial conditions\nfollowing planet formation. An important observational avenue to breaking this\ndegeneracy is to search for eccentric gaps, which could implicate resonantly\ninteracting planets. Unfortunately, massive disks like HL Tau should induce\nswift pericenter precession that would smear out any such eccentric features of\nplanetary origin. This motivates pushing toward more typical, less massive\ndisks.

However, great progress in this area has been\nmade in recent years due to the data collected by the present generation of\nground based detectors like the Pierre Auger Observatory and Telescope Array.\nIn particular, it is believed that the study of the composition of the cosmic\nrays as a function of energy can play a fundamental role for the understanding\nof the origin of the cosmic rays. The observatories belonging to this\ngeneration are composed of arrays of surface detectors and fluorescence\ntelescopes. The duty cycle of the fluorescence telescopes is ~10 % in contrast\nwith the ~100 % of the surface detectors. Therefore, the energy calibration of\nthe events observed by the surface detectors is performed by using a\ncalibration curve obtained from a set of high quality events observed in\ncoincidence by both types of detectors. The advantage of this method is that\nthe reconstructed energy of the events observed by the surface detectors\nbecomes almost independent of simulations of the showers because just a small\npart of the reconstructed energy, obtained from the fluorescence telescopes,\ncomes from simulations.

Here we analyze the multi-wavelength data of the particularly\nwell-observed SN 2006aj, associated with llgrb 060218, finding that its\nprogenitor star is sheathed in an extended ($>100R_\\odot$), low-mass ($\\sim\n0.01M_\\odot$) envelope. This progenitor structure implies that the gamma-ray\nemission in this llgrb is generated by a mildly relativistic shock breakout. It\nalso suggests a unified picture for llgrbs and LGRBs, where the key difference\nis the existence of an extended low-mass envelope in llgrbs and its absence in\nLGRBs. The same engine, which launches a relativistic jet, can drive the two\nexplosions, but, while in LGRBs the ultra-relativistic jet emerges from the\nbare progenitor star and produces the observed gamma-rays, in llgrbs the\nextended envelope smothers the jet and prevents the generation of a large\ngamma-ray luminosity. Instead, the jet deposits all its energy in the envelope,\ndriving a mildly relativistic shock that upon breakout produces a llgrb. In\naddition for giving a unified view of the two phenomena, this model provides a\nnatural explanation to many observed properties of llgrbs. It also implies that\nllgrbs are a viable source of the observed extra-galactic diffuse neutrino flux\nand that they are promising sources for future gravitational wave detectors. \n\n"}

The sample consists of nearly 340 sources with\neither photometric (212) or spectroscopic (128) redshift in the above range.\nThe combination of deep and shallow survey fields provides a luminosity\nbaseline of three orders of magnitude, Lx(2-10keV)~1e43-1e46erg/s at z>3. We\nfollow a Bayesian approach to determine the binned AGN space density and\nexplore their evolution in a model-independent way. Our methodology accounts\nfor Poisson errors in the determination of X-ray fluxes and uncertainties in\nphotometric redshift estimates. We demonstrate that the latter is essential for\nunbiased measurement of space densities. We find that the AGN X-ray luminosity\nfunction evolves strongly between the redshift intervals z=3-4 and z=4-5. There\nis also suggestive evidence that the amplitude of this evolution is luminosity\ndependent. The space density of AGN with Lx<1e45erg/s drops by a factor of 5\nbetween the redshift intervals above, while the evolution of brighter AGN\nappears to be milder. Comparison of our X-ray luminosity function with that of\nUV/optical selected QSOs at similar redshifts shows broad agreement at bright\nluminosities, Lx>1e45erg/s. The faint-end slope of UV/optical luminosity\nfunctions however, is steeper than for X-ray selected AGN. This implies that\nthe type-I AGN fraction increases with decreasing luminosity at z>3, opposite\nto trends established at lower redshift. We also assess the significance of AGN\nin keeping the hydrogen ionised at high redshift. Our X-ray luminosity function\nyields ionising photon rate densities that are insufficient to keep the\nUniverse ionised at redshift z>4. A source of uncertainty in this calculation\nis the escape fraction of UV photons for X-ray selected AGN. \n\n"}

Pinning of vortices to ions can decouple the\nsuperfluid from the crust and create a reservoir of angular momentum. Sudden\nlarge scale unpinning can lead to an observable glitch. In this paper we\ninvestigate the scattering of a free vortex off a pinning potential and\ncalculate its mean free path, in order to assess whether unpinned vortices can\nskip multiple pinning sites and come close enough to their neighbours to\ntrigger avalanches, or whether they simply hop from one pinning site to another\ngiving rise to a more gradual creep. We find that there is a significant range\nof parameter space in which avalanches can be triggered, thus supporting the\nhypothesis that they may lie at the origin of pulsar glitches. For realistic\nvalues of the pinning force and superfluid drag parameters we find that\navalanches are more likely in the higher density regions of the crust where\npinning is stronger. Physical differences in stellar parameters, such as mass\nand temperature, may lead to a switch between creep-like motion and avalanches,\nexplaining the different characteristics of glitching pulsars. \n\n"}

Oscillations have\nbeen observed during the rise and/or decay of some of these X-ray bursts. Those\nseen during the rise can be well explained by a spreading hot spot model, but\nlarge amplitude oscillations in the decay phase remain mysterious because of\nthe absence of a clear-cut source of asymmetry. To date there have not been any\nquantitative studies that consistently track the oscillation amplitude both\nduring the rise and decay (cooling tail) of bursts. Here we compute the light\ncurves and amplitudes of oscillations in X-ray burst models that realistically\naccount for both flame spreading and subsequent cooling.

In this work, we present a detailed\nmulti-wavelength analysis of the 2013 December flaring event. Multi-frequency\nobservations reveal the uncorrelated variability patterns with X-ray and\noptical-UV fluxes peaking after the $\\gamma$-ray maximum. The broadband\nspectral energy distribution (SED) at the peak of the $\\gamma$-ray activity\nshows a rising $\\gamma$-ray spectrum but a declining optical-UV flux. This\nobservation along with the detection of uncorrelated variability behavior rules\nout the one-zone leptonic emission scenario. We, therefore, adopt two\nindependent methodologies to explain the SED: a time dependent lepto-hadronic\nmodeling and a two-zone leptonic radiative modeling approach. In the\nlepto-hadronic modeling, a distribution of electrons and protons subjected to a\nrandomly orientated magnetic field produces synchrotron radiation. Electron\nsynchrotron is used to explain the IR to UV emission while proton synchrotron\nemission is used to explain the high energy $\\gamma$-ray emission. A\ncombination of both electron synchrotron self Compton emission and proton\nsynchrotron emission is used to explain the X-ray spectral break seen during\nthe later stage of the flare. In the two-zone modeling, we assume a large\nemission region emitting primarily in IR to X-rays and $\\gamma$-rays to come\nprimarily from a fast moving compact emission region. We conclude by noting\nthat within a span of 4 months, 3C 279 has shown the dominance of a variety of\nradiative processes over each other and this reflects the complexity involved\nin understanding the physical properties of blazar jets in general. \n\n"}

How neutron star magnetospheric activities affect these two\nphenomena are investigated by using the wind braking model of pulsars.

Young pulsars have\nmeaningful braking indices, while old pulsars' and magnetars' fluctuation item\ndominates their frequency second derivatives. It can explain both the braking\nindex and frequency second derivative of pulsars uniformly. The braking indices\nof eight pulsars are the combined effect of magnetic dipole radiation and\nparticle wind. During the life time of a pulsar, its braking index will evolve\nfrom three to one.

However,\nthe processes that couple jet power to the ambient medium and determine jet\nmorphology are poorly understood.

We obtain a critical power, which depends on the galaxy core mass\nand radius, below which jets become kink-unstable within the core, stall, and\ninflate cavities filled with relativistically-hot plasma. Jets above the\ncritical power stably escape the core and form powerful backflows.

Flattening has two consequences: first, there\nis a geometric effect as the squeezing (or stretching) of the dark matter\ndistribution enhances (or diminishes) the J-factor; second, the line of sight\nvelocity dispersion of stars must hold up the flattened baryonic component in\nthe flattened dark matter halo. We provide analytic formulae and a simple\nnumerical approach to estimate the correction to the J- and D-factors required\nover simple spherical modeling. The formulae are validated with a series of\nequilibrium models of flattened stellar distributions embedded in flattened\ndark-matter distributions. We compute corrections to the J- and D-factors for\nthe Milky Way dwarf spheroidal galaxies under the assumption that they are all\nprolate or all oblate and find that the hierarchy of J-factors for the dwarf\nspheroidals is slightly altered (typical correction factors for an ellipticity\nof $0.4$ are $0.75$ for the oblate case and $1.6$ for the prolate case). We\ndemonstrate that spherical estimates of the D-factors are very insensitive to\nthe flattening and introduce uncertainties significantly less than the\nuncertainties in the D-factors from the other observables for all the dwarf\nspheroidals (for example, ${}^{+10\\mathrm{\\,percent}}_{-3\\mathrm{\\,percent}}$\nfor a typical ellipticity of $0.4$).

For each peak in the LS\nperiodogram, we evaluate the statistical significance in two different ways.\nThe first method involves calculating the False Alarm Probability (FAP) using\nnon-parametric bootstrap resampling, and the second method is by calculating\nthe difference in Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) between the null\nhypothesis, viz. the data contains only noise, compared to the hypothesis that\nthe data contains a peak at a given frequency. Using these methods, we scan the\nfrequency range between 7-14 cycles per year to look for any peaks caused by\nsolar rotation, since this is the proposed explanation for the statistically\nsignificant peaks found by Sturrock and collaborators in the Super-K dataset.\nFrom our analysis, we do confirm that similar to Sturrock et al, the maximum\npeak occurs at a frequency of 9.42/year, corresponding to a period of 38.75\ndays. The FAP for this peak is about 1.5% and the difference in BIC (between\npure white noise and this peak) is about 4.8.

We\naccount for diffusive shock acceleration of CRs at resolved shocks and at\nsupernova remnants in the interstellar medium (ISM), and follow the advective\nCR transport within the magnetised plasma, as well as anisotropic diffusive\ntransport of CRs along the local magnetic field. CR losses are included in\nterms of Coulomb and hadronic interactions with the thermal plasma. We\ndemonstrate the accuracy of our formalism for CR acceleration at shocks through\nsimulations of plane-parallel shock tubes that are compared to newly derived\nexact solutions of the Riemann shock tube problem with CR acceleration. We find\nthat the increased compressibility of the post-shock plasma due to the produced\nCRs decreases the shock speed. However, CR acceleration at spherically\nexpanding blast waves does not significantly break the self-similarity of the\nSedov-Taylor solution; the resulting modifications can be approximated by a\nsuitably adjusted, but constant adiabatic index. In first applications of the\nnew CR formalism to simulations of isolated galaxies and cosmic structure\nformation, we find that CRs add an important pressure component to the ISM that\nincreases the vertical scale height of disk galaxies, and thus reduces the star\nformation rate.

Radio observations, performed with SRT, Medicina,\nEVN and VLBA between day 4 and 140, suggest that the burst exploded in an\nenvironment characterised by a density profile scaling with the distance from\nthe source (wind profile). A remarkable feature of the prompt emission is the\npresence of a bright flare 100 s after the trigger, lasting 70 seconds in the\nsoft X-ray band, which was simultaneously detected from the optical band up to\nthe MeV energy range.

The problem\naddressed by the resolution is a lack of established conversion constants\nbetween solar and planetary values and SI units: a missing standard has caused\na proliferation of solar values (e.g., solar radius, solar irradiance, solar\nluminosity, solar effective temperature and solar mass parameter) in the\nliterature, with cited solar values typically based on best estimates at the\ntime of paper writing. As precision of observations increases, a set of\nconsistent values becomes increasingly important.

Our M-dwarf radial velocity\nmonitoring with HARPS-N can provide a major contribution to the widening of the\ncurrent statistics through the in-depth analysis of accurate radial velocity\nobservations in a narrow range of spectral sub-types (79 stars, between dM0 to\ndM3).

Our survey will bring a contribute to\nthe surveys devoted to the search for planets around M-dwarfs, mainly focused\non the M-dwarf population of the northern emisphere, for which we will provide\nan estimate of the planet occurence. Methods. We present here a long duration\nradial velocity monitoring of the M1 dwarf star GJ 3998 with HARPS-N to\nidentify periodic signals in the data.

Extragalactic cosmic rays\nshould be isotropic, but galactic cosmic rays of this type should be seen\nmostly along the galactic plane, and there should be a shortage of events\ncoming from directions near the galactic anticenter.

Accretion is\nheterogeneous in space, because of the mass distribution, with mass approaching\nthe accreting star-disk system in filaments and sheets. Finally, accretion is\nheterogeneous among stars, since the detailed conditions and dynamics in the\nneighborhood of each star can vary widely. We also investigate the sensitivity\nof disk formation to physical conditions, and test their robustness by varying\nnumerical parameters. We find that disk formation is robust even when choosing\nthe least favorable sink particle parameters, and that turbulence cascading\nfrom larger scales is a decisive factor in disk formation. We also investigate\nthe transport of angular momentum, finding that the net inward mechanical\ntransport is compensated for mainly by an outward directed magnetic transport,\nwith a contribution from gravitational torques usually subordinate to the\nmagnetic transport. \n\n"}

Such events would be\nobservationally indistinguishable from neutral current deep-inelastic\nscattering events due to neutrinos. Consequently, one reason for deviations,\nbreaks or excesses in the expected astrophysical power-law neutrino spectrum\ncould be the flux of such a particle. Motivated by features in the recent\n1347-day IceCube high energy starting event data (HESE), we focus on particular\nboosted dark matter ($\\chi$) related realizations of this premise. Here, $\\chi$\nis assumed to be much lighter than, and the result of, the slow decay of a\nmassive scalar ($\\phi$) which constitutes a major fraction of the Universe's\ndark matter. We show that this hypothesis, coupled with a standard power-law\nastrophysical neutrino flux is capable of providing very good fits to the\npresent data, along with a possible explanation of other features in the HESE\nsample.

We investigate the\nrelative importance of spiral shocks and the magnetorotational instability\n(MRI) in driving angular momentum transport and how each depend on the geometry\nand strength of seed magnetic field and the Mach number of the disk (where Mach\nnumber is ratio of the azimuthal velocity and the sound speed of gas). We use a\nlocally isothermal equation of state and adopt temperature profiles that are\nconsistent with CV disk observations. Our results indicate that the relative\nimportance of spiral shocks and MRI in driving angular momentum transport is\ncontrolled by the gas Mach number and the seed magnetic field strength. MRI and\nspiral shocks provide comparable efficiency of angular momentum transport when\nthe disk Mach number is around 10 and the seed magnetic field has plasma\n$\\beta=400$ (where $\\beta$ is ratio of gas pressure and magnetic pressure).

However, many astrophysical systems are contracting\nunder the influence of external pressure or gravity, and the balance between\ndriving and dissipation in a contracting, magnetized medium has yet to be\nstudied. In this paper we present three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamic\n(MHD) simulations of compression in a turbulent, magnetized medium that\nresembles the physical conditions inside molecular clouds. We find that in some\ncircumstances the combination of compression and magnetic fields leads to a\nrate of turbulent dissipation far less than that observed in non-magnetized\ngas, or in non-compressing magnetized gas. As a result, a compressing,\nmagnetized gas reaches an equilibrium velocity dispersion much greater than\nwould be expected for either the hydrodynamic or the non-compressing case.

The unprecedented five hours of strictly\nsimultaneous X-ray and radio continuum coverage for the first time\nunambiguously show a highly reproducible, anti-correlated variability pattern.\nThe characteristic switches from the X-ray high mode into a low mode are always\naccompanied by a radio brightening with duration that closely matches the X-ray\nlow mode interval.

Based on the\nobservations of SGRBs, we could derive the merger rates of these compact\nbinaries, and study the stochastic GW backgrounds (SGWBs) or the co-detection\nrates of GWs associate with SGRBs (GW-SGRBs). But before that, the most\nimportant thing is to derive the GW spectrum from a single GW source. Usually,\nGW spectrum from a circular orbit binary is assumed. However, observations of\nthe large spatial offsets of SGRBs from their host galaxies imply that SGRB\nprogenitors may be formed by the dynamical processes, and will merge with\nresidual eccentricities. The orbital eccentricity has important effect on GW\nspectra, and therefore on the SGWB and GW-SGRB co-detection rate. Our results\nshow that the power spectra of the SGWBs from eccentric compact binaries are\ngreatly suppressed at low frequencies. Especially, SGWBs from binaries with\nhigh residual eccentricities will hard to be detected (above the detection\nfrequency of $\\sim100~\\rm Hz$).

Yet, nobody has ever seen a black\nhole. What do they look like? Initially, this question seemed more of an\nacademic nature. However, this has changed over the past two decades.\nObservations and theoretical considerations suggest that the supermassive black\nhole, Sgr A*, in the center of our Milky Way is surrounded by a compact, foggy\nemission region radiating at and above 230 GHz. It has been predicted that the\nevent horizon of Sgr A* should cast its shadow onto that emission region, which\ncould be detectable with a global VLBI array of radio telescopes.

As\nan effort to address this problem, we here explore possible roles of Alfv\\'en\nwaves self-excited via resonant streaming instability during the CR\nacceleration at parallel shocks. The mean drift of Alfv\\'en waves may either\nincrease or decrease the scattering center compression ratio, depending on the\npostshock cross-helicity, leading to either flatter or steeper CR spectra. We\nfirst examine such effects at planar shocks, based on the transport of Alfv\\'en\nwaves in the small amplitude limit. For the shock parameters relevant to\ncluster shocks, Alfv\\'enic drift flattens the CR spectrum slightly, resulting\nin a small increase of the CR acceleration efficiency, $\\eta$. We then consider\ntwo additional, physically motivated cases: (1) postshock waves are isotropized\nvia MHD and plasma processes across the shock transition and (2) postshock\nwaves contain only forward waves propagating along with the flow due to a\npossible gradient of CR pressure behind the shock.

Recent studies have focussed on also explaining the observed\npolarization profiles, that show even more dramatic variations during the\npassage of these shock fronts. While most of these variations can be explained\nwith an almost constant magnetic field as a function of time, several studies\nhave reported changes in the inferred magnetic field strength during UF phases.\nIn this study we investigate the origin of these periodic variations of the\nmagnetic field strength by analyzing a time-series of high temporal cadence\nobservations acquired in the Ca II line with the CRISP instrument at the\nSwedish 1-m Solar Telescope. In particular, we analyze how the inferred\ngeometrical height scale changes between quiescent and UF phases, and whether\nthose changes are enough to explain the observed changes in $B$. We have\nperformed non-LTE data inversions with the NICOLE code of a time-series of very\nhigh spatio-temporal resolution observations in the Ca II and Fe I\n630.15\\630.25 nm lines.

We derive an empirically\nmotivated characteristic scale length of $L$=2.17$\\pm$0.12 kpc for this BHXRB\npopulation to infer distances based upon an exponentially decreasing space\ndensity prior. Geometric DR2 parallaxes provide new, independent distance\nestimates, but the faintness of this population in quiescence results in\nrelatively large fractional distance uncertainties. Despite this, DR2 estimates\ngenerally agree with literature distances. The most discrepant case is BW Cir,\nfor which detailed studies of the donor star have suggested a distant location\nat >~25 kpc. A large DR2 measured parallax and relatively high proper motion\ninstead prefer significantly smaller distances, suggesting that the source may\ninstead be amongst the nearest of XRBs. However, both distances create problems\nfor interpretation of the source, and follow-up data are required to resolve\nits true nature. DR2 also provides a first distance estimate to one source,\nMAXI J1820+070, and novel proper motion estimates for 7 sources.

In\nthese environments, energetic CRs are virtually collisionless and interact via\ncollective phenomena mediated by kinetic-scale plasma waves and large-scale\nmagnetic fields. The enormous separation of kinetic and global astrophysical\nscales requires a hydrodynamic description. Here, we develop a new macroscopic\ntheory for CR transport in the self-confinement picture, which includes CR\ndiffusion and streaming. The interaction between CRs and electromagnetic fields\nof Alfv\\'enic turbulence provides the main source of CR scattering, and causes\nCRs to stream along the magnetic field with the Alfv\\'en velocity if resonant\nwaves are sufficiently energetic. However, numerical simulations struggle to\ncapture this effect with current transport formalisms and adopt regularization\nschemes to ensure numerical stability.

Both purposes require us to assume some functional form\nof the ellipticity distribution, and as a proof of principle we take two toy\ndistributions.

We show that by\nincorporating a common parameterized prior ellipticity distribution we can be\nmore efficient at detecting gravitational waves from the whole ensemble of\nsources than trying to combine observations with a simpler non-hierarchical\nmethod.

A search\n  for spin-superorbital correlation in SMC X-1 Abstract: Thanks to long-term X-ray monitoring, a number of interacting binaries are\nnow known to show X-ray periodicities on timescales of tens to hundreds of\nbinary orbits. In some systems, precession of a warped accretion disc is the\nleading model to explain the superorbital modulation. The High Mass X-ray\nBinary SMC X-1 showed two excursions in superorbital period (from ~60d to ~45d)\nduring the 1996-2011 interval, suggesting that some characteristic of the\naccretion disc is varying on a timescale of years. Because its behaviour as an\nX-ray pulsar has also been intensively monitored, SMC X-1 offers the rare\nchance to track changes in both the accretion disk and pulsar behaviours over\nthe same interval. We have used archival X-ray observations of SMC X-1 to\ninvestigate whether the evolution of its superorbital variation and pulse\nperiod are correlated. We use the 16-year dataset afforded by the RXTE~All-Sky\nMonitor to trace the behaviour of the warped accretion disc in this system, and\nuse published pulse-period histories to trace the behaviour of the pulsar.\nWhile we cannot claim a strong detection of correlation, the first superorbital\nperiod excursion near MJD 50,800 does coincide with structure in SMC X-1's\npulse period history. Our preferred interpretation is that the superorbital\nperiod excursion coincides with a change in the long-term spin-up rate of the\nSMC X-1 pulsar. In this scenario, the pulsar and the accretion disc are both\nresponding to a change in the accretion flow, which the disc itself may\nregulate. \n\n"}

While radio bubbles inflated by AGN jets\ncould be dynamically supported by cosmic rays (CRs), the impact of CR-dominated\njets are not well understood. In this work, we perform three-dimensional\nsimulations of CR-jet feedback in an isolated cluster atmosphere; we find that\nCR jets impact the multiphase gas differently than jets dominated by kinetic\nenergy. In particular, CR bubbles can more efficiently uplift the cluster gas\nand cause an outward expansion of the hot ICM. Due to adiabatic cooling from\nthe expansion and less efficient heating from CR bubbles by direct mixing, the\nICM is more prone to local thermal instabilities, which will later enhance\nchaotic cold accretion onto the AGN. The amount of cold gas formed during the\nbubble formation and its late-time evolution sensitively depend on whether CR\ntransport processes are included or not.

The machine learning\nmodel is then applied to available observed parameters for Galactic GCs to\nidentify which of them that are most likely to be hosting a sizeable number of\nBHs and reveal insights into what properties lead to the formation of BH\nsubsystems. With our machine learning model, we were able to shortlist 21\nGalactic GCs that are most likely to contain a BH subsystem.

Geometry of the hot\n  corona from spectroscopic and polarization signatures Abstract: The spectral shape of the hard X-ray continuum of Active Galactic Nuclei\n(AGN) can be ascribed to inverse Compton scattering of optical/UV seed photons\nfrom the accretion disc by a hot corona of electrons. This physical process\nproduces a polarization signal which is strongly sensitive to the geometry of\nthe scattering medium (i.e. the hot corona) and of the radiation field. MoCA\n(Monte Carlo code for Comptonisation in Astrophysics) is a versatile code which\nallows for different geometries and configurations to be tested for Compton\nscattering in compact objects. A single photon approach is considered as well\nas polarisation and Klein-Nishina effects. In this work, we selected four\ndifferent geometries for the scattering electrons cloud above the accretion\ndisc, namely an extended slab, an extended spheroid and two compact spheroids.\nWe discuss the first application of the MoCA model to reproduce the hard X-ray\nprimary continuum of the bare Seyfert 1 galaxy Ark 120, using different\ngeometries for the hot corona above the accretion disc. We report on the\nspectral analysis of the simultaneous 2013 and 2014 XMM-Newton and NuSTAR\nobservations of the source. A general agreement is found between the best fit\nvalues of the hot coronal parameters obtained with MoCA and the ones inferred\nusing other Comptonisation codes from the literature. The expected polarization\nsignal from the best fits with MoCA is then presented and discussed, in view of\nthe launch in 2021 of the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). We find\nthat none of the tested geometries for the hot corona (extended slab and\nextended/compact spheroids) can be statistically preferred, based on\nspectroscopy solely. In the future, an IXPE observation less than 1 Ms long\nwill clearly distinguish between an extended slab or a spherical hot corona. \n\n"}

We\nintroduce a novel tool: the \"mass-luminosity plane\" or \"M-L plane\", as an\nequivalent to the traditional HR diagram, utilising it to reproduce the testbed\nbinary HD166734 with newly calibrated MESA stellar evolution models for single\nstars. We can only reproduce the Galactic binary system with an enhanced amount\nof core overshooting (alpha = 0.5), mass loss, and rotational mixing. We can\nutilise the gradient in the M-L plane to constrain the amount of mass loss to\n0.5 - 1.5 times the standard Vink et al. 2001 prescriptions, and we can exclude\nextreme reduction or multiplication factors. The extent of the vectors in the\nM-L plane leads us to conclude that the amount of core overshooting is larger\nthan is normally adopted in contemporary massive star evolution models. We\nfurthermore conclude that rotational mixing is mandatory to get the nitrogen\nabundance ratios between the primary and secondary components to be correct\n(3:1) in our testbed binary system.

Finally, the increased amount of\ncore overshooting has -- via the compactness parameter -- implications for\nsupernova explodibility. \n\n"}

The event\ngenerator is designed to fulfil typical astrophysical requirements, but can\nalso be used for radiation and background studies at high energy colliders such\nas LEP2 and HERA, as well as for simulations of photon induced air showers.\n  We consider the full photopion production cross section from the pion\nproduction threshold up to high energies.\n  It includes resonance excitation and decay, direct single pion production and\ndiffractive and non-diffractive multiparticle production.\n  The cross section of each individual process is calculated by fitting\nexperimental data, while the kinematics is determined by the underlying\nparticle production process. We demonstrate that our model is capable of\nreproducing known accelerator data over a wide energy range. \n\n"}
{"id": "astro-ph/9912240", "contents": "Title: Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays from Young Neutron Star Winds Abstract: The long-held notion that the highest-energy cosmic rays are of distant\nextragalactic origin is challenged by observations that events above $\\sim\n10^{20}$ eV do not exhibit the expected high-energy cutoff from photopion\nproduction off the cosmic microwave background. We suggest that these\nunexpected ultra-high-energy events are due to iron nuclei accelerated from\nyoung strongly magnetized neutron stars through relativistic MHD winds. We find\nthat neutron stars whose initial spin periods are shorter than $\\sim 4\n(B_S/10^{13}{\\rm G})^{1/2}$ ms, where $B_S$ is the surface magnetic field, can\naccelerate iron cosmic rays to greater than $\\sim 10^{20}$ eV. These ions can\npass through the remnant of the supernova explosion that produced the neutron\nstar without suffering significant spallation reactions. For plausible models\nof the Galactic magnetic field, the trajectories of the iron ions curve\nsufficiently to be consistent with the observed arrival directions of the\nhighest energy events. \n\n"}
{"id": "hep-ph/9812418", "contents": "Title: High-Energy Tests of Lorentz Invariance Abstract: We develop a perturbative framework with which to discuss departures from\nexact Lorentz invariance and explore their potentially observable\nramifications. Tiny non-invariant terms introduced into the standard model\nLagrangian are assumed to be renormalizable (dimension $\\le 4$), invariant\nunder $SU(3)\\otimes SU(2)\\otimes U(1)$ gauge transformations, and rotationally\nand translationally invariant in a preferred frame. There are a total of 46\nindependent TCP-even perturbations of this kind, all of which preserve anomaly\ncancellation. They define the energy-momentum eigenstates and their maximal\nattainable velocities in the high-energy limit. The effects of these\nperturbations increase rapidly with energy in the preferred frame, more rapidly\nthan those of TCP-odd perturbations. Our analysis of Lorentz-violating\nkinematics reveals several striking new phenomena that are relevant both to\ncosmic-ray physics ({\\it e.g.,} by undoing the GZK cutoff) and neutrino physics\n({\\it e.g.,} by generating novel types of neutrino oscillations). These may\nlead to new and sensitive high-energy tests of special relativity. \n\n"}
