Gas discs may dominate binary\ndynamics on these scales, and promote mergers. Using numerical simulations, we\ninvestigate the evolution of the orbits of binaries embedded within\ngeometrically thin gas discs. Our simulations directly resolve angular momentum\ntransport within the disc, which at the radii of interest is likely dominated\nby disc self-gravity. We show that the binary decays at a rate which is in good\nagreement with analytical estimates, while the eccentricity grows. Saturation\nof eccentricity growth is not observed up to values e > 0.35. Accretion onto\nthe black holes is variable, and is roughly modulated by the binary orbital\nfrequency. Scaling our results, we analytically estimate the maximum rate of\nbinary decay that is possible without fragmentation occuring within the\nsurrounding gas disc, and compare that rate to an estimate of the stellar\ndynamical hardening rate. For binary masses in the range 10^5 < M/Msun < 10^8\nwe find that decay due to gas discs may dominate for separations below a ~\n0.01--0.1 pc, where the disc is optically thick.

Most of the the PM stars and BDs are\nejected by mutual interactions. We analyse the statistical properties of these\nstars, and compare them with observations. After a few hundred thousand years\nthe Sun-like primary is typically left with a close low-mass HB companion, and\ntwo much wider companions: a low-mass HB star and a BD star, or a BD-BD binary.\nThere is a BD desert extending out to at least ~100 AU; this is because BDs\ntend to be formed further out than low-mass HB stars, and then they tend to be\nscattered even further out, or even into the field.

First we demonstrate that some\nsize evolution of the population can be expected simply due to the continuous\nemergence of early-type galaxies. SDSS data reveal that in the present-day\nuniverse more compact early-type galaxies with a given dynamical mass have\nolder stellar populations. In contrast, at a given stellar velocity dispersion,\nSDSS data show that there is no relation between size and age, which implies\nthat the velocity dispersion can be used to estimate the epoch at which\ngalaxies stopped forming stars, turning into early-type galaxies. Applying such\na 'formation' criterion to a large sample of nearby early-type galaxies, we\npredict the redshift evolution in the size distribution and the comoving mass\ndensity. The resulting evolution in the mean size is roughly half of the\nobserved evolution. Then we include a prescription for the merger histories of\ngalaxies between the 'formation' redshift and the present, based on\ncosmological simulations of the assembly of dark matter halos. Such mergers\nafter the transformation into an early-type galaxy are presumably\ndissipationless ('dry'), where the increase in size is expected to be\napproximately proportional to the increase in mass. This model successfully\nreproduces the observed evolution since z~2 in the mean size and in the\ncomoving mass density of massive early-type galaxies.

First, a\nkinematical model is constructed for SN Ia 2003hv, which can account for the\nmain features in its optical, Near-Infrared (NIR), and Mid-Infrared (Mid-IR)\nlate-time spectra. It is found that an asymmetric off-center model can explain\nthe observed characteristics of SN 2003hv. This model includes a relatively\nhigh density, Fe-rich region which displays a large velocity off-set, and a\nrelatively low density, extended 56Ni-rich region which is more spherically\ndistributed. The high density region consists of the inner stable Fe-Ni region\nand outer 56Ni-rich region. Such a distribution may be the result of a\ndelayed-detonation explosion, in which the first deflagration produces the\nglobal asymmetry in the innermost ejecta, while the subsequent detonation can\nlead to the bulk spherical symmetry. This configuration, if viewed from the\ndirection of the off-set, can consistently explain the blueshift in some of the\nemission lines and virtually no observed shift in other lines in SN 2003hv. For\nthis model, we then explore the effects of different viewing angles and the\nimplications for SNe Ia in general. The model predicts that a variation of the\ncentral wavelength, depending on the viewing angle, should be seen in some\nlines (e.g., [Ni II]7378), while the strongest lines (e.g., [Fe III] blend at\n4700A) will not show this effect.

We estimate the\ngalaxy is losing its warm H_2 gas at a rate of ~ 2-3 solar masses per year. The\ntrue mass loss rate is likely higher if we account for cold molecular gas and\natomic gas.

Recent Spitzer\nobservations revealed an infrared (IR) shell containing a dozen point sources\narranged in a ring-like structure, previously proposed to be young stellar\nobjects. An extended knot of emission located in the NW part of the shell\nappears to be aligned with the pulsar's X-ray jet, suggesting a possible\ninteraction with the shell material. Surprisingly, the IRS spectrum of the knot\nresembles the spectrum of freshly formed dust in Cas A, and is dominated by an\nunidentified dust emission feature at 21 microns. The spectra of the shell also\ncontain various emission lines and show that some are significantly broadened,\nsuggesting that they originate in rapidly expanding supernova (SN) ejecta. We\npresent the first evidence that the PWN is driving shocks into expanding SN\nejecta and we propose an alternative explanation for the origin of the IR\nemission in which the shell is composed entirely of SN ejecta. In this\nscenario, the freshly formed SN dust is being heated by early-type stars\nbelonging to a cluster in which the SN exploded. Simple dust models show that\nthis interpretation can give rise to the observed shell emission and the IR\npoint sources. \n\n"}

This is the first in-depth analysis of the X-ray\nspectral characteristics of this source. We found that the flux of 1ES 1210-646\nvaries by a factor of about 3 on a timescale of hundreds of seconds and by a\nfactor of at least 10 among observations acquired over a time span of several\nmonths. The X-ray spectrum of 1ES 1210-646 is described using a simple powerlaw\nshape or, in the case of INTEGRAL data, with a blackbody plus powerlaw model.\nSpectral variability is found in connection with different flux levels of the\nsource. A strong and transient iron emission line with an energy of about 6.7\nkeV and an equivalent width of about 1.6 keV is detected when the source is\nfound at an intermediate flux level. The line strength seems to be tied to the\norbital motion of the accreting object, as this feature is only apparent at the\nperiastron. Although the X-ray spectral description we find for the 1ES\n1210-646 emission is quite atypical for a high-mass X-ray binary, the\nmultiwavelegth information available for this object leads us to confirm this\nclassification. The results presented here allow us instead to definitely rule\nout the possibility that 1ES 1210-646 is a (magnetic) cataclysmic variable as\nproposed previously and, in a broader sense, a white dwarf nature for the\naccretor is disfavoured. X-ray spectroscopic data actually suggest a neutron\nstar with a low magnetic field as the accreting object in this system. \n\n"}

To test a standard chemical evolution model for spiral disks in the\nLocal Universe and study the influence of a threshold gas density and different\nefficiencies in the star formation rate (SFR) law on radial gradients\n(abundance, gas and SFR). We adopt a one-infall chemical evolution model where\nthe Galactic disk forms inside-out by means of infall of gas, and we test\ndifferent thresholds and efficiencies in the SFR. The model is scaled to the\ndisk properties of three Local Group galaxies (the Milky Way, M31 and M33) by\nvarying its dependence on the star formation efficiency and the time scale for\nthe infalling gas into the disk. Using this simple model we are able to\nreproduce most of the observed constraints available in the literature for the\nstudied galaxies. The radial oxygen abundance gradients and their time\nevolution are studied in detail. The present day abundance gradients are more\nsensitive to the threshold than to other parameters, while their temporal\nevolutions are more dependent on the chosen SFR efficiency. The most massive\ndisks seem to have evolved faster (i.e. with more efficient star formation)\nthan the less massive ones, thus suggesting a downsizing in star formation for\nspirals. The threshold and the efficiency of star formation play a very\nimportant role in the chemical evolution of spiral disks and an efficiency\nvarying with radius can be used to regulate the star formation. The oxygen\nabundance gradient can steepen or flatten in time depending on the choice of\nthis parameter \n\n"}

Previous attempts to\nmeasure such deficits depended on fitting some functional form to the profile\nat large radii and extrapolating inwards; this is sensitive to the assumed\nfunctional form and does not allow for variation in nuclear profile shapes. We\ntake advantage of larger data sets to directly construct stellar mass profiles\nof observed systems and measure the stellar mass enclosed in a series of\nphysical radii (M(<R)), for samples of cusp and core spheroids at the same\nstellar mass. There is a significant bimodality in this distribution at small\nradii, and we non-parametrically measure the median offset between core and\ncusp populations (the deficit Delta_M(<R)). We construct the scoured mass\nprofile as a function of radius, without reference to any assumed functional\nform. The mass deficit rises in power-law fashion (Delta_M(<R) R^{1.3-1.8})\nfrom a significant but small mass at R<10pc, to asymptote to a maximum ~0.5-2\nM_BH at ~100pc.

It has earlier been proposed that UHECRs could be\naccelerated in either the nucleus or the outer lobes of the nearby radio galaxy\nCen A. We show that UHECR production at a spatially intermediate location about\n15 kpc northeast from the nucleus, where the jet emerging from the nucleus is\nobserved to strike a large star-forming shell of gas, is a plausible\nalternative. A relativistic jet is capable of accelerating lower-energy heavy\nseed cosmic rays (CRs) to UHECRs on timescales comparable to the time it takes\nthe jet to pierce the large gaseous cloud. In this model many CRs arising from\na starburst, with a composition enhanced in heavy elements near the knee region\naround PeV, are boosted to ultra-high energies by the relativistic shock of a\nnewly oriented jet.

We\nmeasure these lines in two turn-off (TO) stars in the Globular Cluster NGC 6752\nand two TO stars in the Globular Cluster NGC 6397 and derive abundances with 3D\nhydrodynamical model atmospheres computed with the CO5BOLD code. These\nabundances are compared to the Cu abundances measured in giant stars of the\nsame clusters, using the lines of Mult. 2 at 510.5 nm and 578.2 nm. Results.\nThe abundances derived from the lines of Mult. 1 in TO stars differ from the\nabundances of giants of the same clusters. This is true both using CO5BOLD\nmodels and using traditional 1D model atmospheres. The LTE 3D corrections for\nTO stars are large, while they are small for giant stars. Conclusions. The Cu I\nresonance lines of Mult. 1 are not reliable abundance indicators. It is likely\nthat departures from LTE should be taken into account to properly describe\nthese lines, although it is not clear if these alone can account for the\nobservations. An investigation of these departures is indeed encouraged for\nboth dwarfs and giants. Our recommendation to those interested in the study of\nthe evolution of copper abundances is to rely on the measurements in giants,\nbased on the lines of Mult. 2. We caution, however, that NLTE studies may imply\na revision in all the Cu abundances, both in dwarfs and giants. \n\n"}

However, the standard\napproach usually assumes both data and parameter estimates are\nGaussian-distributed. Further, for survey forecasts and optimisation it is\nusually assumed the power-spectra covariance matrix is diagonal in\nFourier-space. But in the low-redshift Universe, non-linear mode-coupling will\ntend to correlate small-scale power, moving information from lower to\nhigher-order moments of the field. This movement of information will change the\npredictions of cosmological parameter accuracy. In this paper we quantify this\nloss of information by comparing naive Gaussian Fisher matrix forecasts with a\nMaximum Likelihood parameter estimation analysis of a suite of mock weak\nlensing catalogues derived from N-body simulations, based on the SUNGLASS\npipeline, for a 2-D and tomographic shear analysis of a Euclid-like survey. In\nboth cases we find that the 68% confidence area of the Omega_m-sigma_8 plane\nincreases by a factor 5. However, the marginal errors increase by just 20 to\n40%. We propose a new method to model the effects of nonlinear shear-power\nmode-coupling in the Fisher Matrix by approximating the shear-power\ndistribution as a multivariate Gaussian with a covariance matrix derived from\nthe mock weak lensing survey. We find that this approximation can reproduce the\n68% confidence regions of the full Maximum Likelihood analysis in the\nOmega_m-sigma_8 plane to high accuracy for both 2-D and tomographic weak\nlensing surveys. Finally, we perform a multi-parameter analysis of Omega_m,\nsigma_8, h, n_s, w_0 and w_a to compare the Gaussian and non-linear\nmode-coupled Fisher matrix contours. (Abridged) \n\n"}

In the turbulent shell, the magnetic field is amplified as a\nresult of turbulent dynamo action. In the case of a young supernova remnant,\nthe corresponding strength of the magnetic field is approximately 1 mG. The\npropagation speed of the shock wave is significantly stalled in the clouds\nbecause of the high density, while the shock maintains a high velocity in the\ndiffuse surrounding. In addition, when the shock wave hits the clouds,\nreflection shock waves are generated that propagate back into the shocked\nshell. From these simulation results, many observational characteristics of a\nyoung SNR RX J1713.7-3946 that is suggested to be interacting with molecular\nclouds, can be explained as follows: The reflection shocks can accelerate\nparticles in the turbulent downstream region where the magnetic field strength\nreaches 1mG, which causes short-time variability of synchrotron X-rays. Since\nthe shock velocity is stalled locally in the clouds, the temperature in the\nshocked cloud is suppressed below 1 keV.

Since follow-up\nresources for extracting novel science from fast-changing transients are\nprecious, self-calibrating classification probabilities must be couched in\nterms of efficiencies for discovery and purity of the samples generated. We\nestimate the purity and efficiency in identifying real sources with a two-epoch\nimage-difference discovery algorithm for the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF)\nsurvey. Once given a source discovery, using machine-learned classification\ntrained on PTF data, we distinguish between transients and variable stars with\na 3.8% overall error rate (with 1.7% errors for imaging within the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey footprint).

Abstract: We explore the minimal conditions which enable the formation of\nmetal-enriched solar and sub-solar mass stars. We find that in the absence of\ndust grains, gas fragmentation occurs at densities nH ~ [10^4-10^5]cm^{-3} when\nthe metallicity exceeds Z ~ 10^{-4} Zsun. The resulting fragmentation masses\nare > 10 Msun. The inclusion of Fe and Si cooling does not affect the thermal\nevolution as this is dominated by molecular cooling even for metallicities as\nlarge as Z = 10^{-2} Zsun. The presence of dust is the key driver for the\nformation of low-mass stars. We focus on three representative core-collapse\nsupernova (SN) progenitors, and consider the effects of reverse shocks of\nincreasing strength: these reduce the depletion factors, fdep =\nMdust/(Mdust+Mmet), alter the shape of the grain size distribution function and\nmodify the relative abundances of grain species and of metal species in the gas\nphase. We find that the lowest metallicity at which fragmentation occurs is\nZ=10^{-6} Zsun for gas pre-enriched by the explosion of a 20 Msun primordial SN\n(fdep > 0.22) and/or by a 35 Msun, Z=10^{-4} Zsun SN (fdep > 0.26); it is ~ 1\ndex larger, when the gas is pre-enriched by a Z = 10^{-4} Zsun, 20 Msun SN\n(fdep > 0.04). Cloud fragmentation depends on the depletion factor and it is\nsuppressed when the reverse shock leads to a too large destruction of dust\ngrains. These features are all consistent with the existence of a minimum\ndust-to-gas ratio, Dcr, above which fragmentation is activated. We derive a\nsimple analytic expression for Dcr which, for grain composition and properties\nexplored in the present study, reads Dcr = [2.6 - 6.3] x 10^{-9}. When the\ndust-to-gas ratio of star forming clouds exceeds this value, the fragmentation\nmasses range between 0.01 Msun and 1 Msun, thus enabling the formation of the\nfirst low-mass stars. \n\n"}

However, if a\ncritical magnetic Reynolds number, Re_{M,crit}, is used to determine the extent\nof the dead zone, the surface density in the layer generally increases with\nradius. For small critical magnetic Reynolds number of order 1, the constant\nlayer approximation may be a reasonable fit.

For the\nmetallicity variation between our galaxy, the LMC and the SMC, there should be\nno significant difference in the extent of the dead zone. Observations suggest\nan increase in the lifetime of the disc with decreasing metallicity that cannot\nbe explained by the dead zone structure (ignoring possible differences in dust\nabundances). \n\n"}

PETs do not affect scattering phase\nshifts and bound state energies of two-body system but are conventionally\nsupposed to modify two-body bound state observables such as the rms radius and\nelectromagnetic moments. Purpose: In order to preserve all bound state\nobservables, we propose a new particular case of PETs, a deuteron-equivalent\ntransformation (DET-PET), which leaves unchanged not only scattering phase\nshifts and bound state (deuteron) binding energy but also the bound state wave\nfunction. Methods: The construction of DET-PET is discussed; equations defining\nthe simplest DET-PETs are derived. We apply these simplest DET-PETs to the\nJISP16 $NN$ interaction and use the transformed $NN$ interactions in\ncalculations of $^3$H and $^4$He binding energies in the No-core Full\nConfiguration (NCFC) approach based on extrapolations of the No-core Shell\nModel (NCSM) basis space results to the infinite basis space. Results: We\ndemonstrate the DET-PET modification of the $np$ scattering wave functions and\nstudy the DET-PET manifestation in the binding energies of $^3$H and $^4$He\nnuclei and their correlation (Tjon line).

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the cooling of\nrotationally deformed, two-dimensional (2D) neutron stars in the framework of\ngeneral relativity theory, with the ultimate goal of better understand the\nimpact of 2D effects on the thermal evolution of such objects.

The good angular resolution in the medium\n(few hundred GeV) to high (above 1 TeV) energies allow us to perform\nmorphological studies. We detect an extended emission of very-high-energy gamma\nrays, with a significance of 11 standard deviations.

Typically the inflaton\ndecays while it oscillates around the minimum of its potential. If the inflaton\ndecay is not complete or sufficient then the remaining energy density of the\ninflaton after reheating must be fine tuned to give the correct amount of Dark\nMatter. An essential feature here, is that Dark Matter-Inflaton particle is\nproduced at low energies without fine tuning or new parameters. This process\nuses the same coupling g as for the inflaton decay. Once the field phi becomes\nnon-relativistic it will decouple as any WIMP particle, since n_phi is\nexponentially suppressed. The correct amount of Dark Matter determines the\ncross section and we have a constraint between the coupling $g$ and the mass\n$m_o$ of phi.

We then assign\nstellar mass profile and velocity dispersion profile parameters to each system\nin the SEC using their observed correlations with M_star and sigma.\nSimultaneously, we solve for dark matter density profile of each halo using the\nspherical Jeans equation. The resulting dark matter density profiles deviate in\ngeneral from the dissipationless profile of NFW or Einasto and their mean inner\ndensity slope and concentration vary systematically with M_vir. Statistical\ntests of the distribution of profiles at fixed M_vir rule out the null\nhypothesis that it follows the distribution predicted by N-body simulations for\nM_vir ~< 10^{13.5-14.5} M_solar. These dark matter profiles imply that dark\nmatter density is, on average, enhanced significantly in the inner region of\nhalos with M_vir ~< 10^{13.5-14.5} M_solar supporting halo contraction. The\nmain characteristics of halo contraction are: (1) the mean dark matter density\nwithin the effective radius has increased by a factor varying systematically up\nto ~ 3-4 at M_vir = 10^{12} M_solar, and (2) the inner density slope has a mean\nof <alpha> ~ 1.3 with rho(r) ~ r^{-alpha} and a halo-to-halo rms scatter of\nrms(alpha) ~ 0.4-0.5 for 10^{12} M_solar ~< M_vir ~< 10^{13-14} M_solar steeper\nthan the NFW profile (alpha=1).

One important question is\nwhether the chemical abundances in this star reflect the chemical composition\nof the gas cloud from which it was formed or if they have been severely\naffected by other processes, such as dust-gas winnowing. Aims: We measure or\nprovide an upper limit to the abundance of the volatile element sulphur, which\ncan help to discriminate between the two scenarios. Methods: We observed HE\n1327-2326 with the high resolution infra-red spectrograph CRIRES at the VLT to\nobserve the S I lines of Multiplet 3 at 1045 nm. Results: We do not detect the\nS I line. A 3sigma$upper limit on the equivalent width (EW) of any line in our\nspectrum is EW<0.66 pm. Using either one-dimensional static or\nthree-dimensional hydrodynamical model-atmospheres, this translates into a\nrobust upper limit of [S/H]<-2.6. Conclusions: This upper limit does not\nprovide conclusive evidence for or against dust-gas winnowing, and the evidence\ncoming from other elements (e.g., Na and Ti) is also inconclusive or\ncontradictory. The formation of dust in the atmosphere versus an origin of the\nmetals in a metal-poor supernova with extensive \"fall-back\" are not mutually\nexclusive. It is possible that dust formation distorts the peculiar abundance\npattern created by a supernova with fall-back, thus the abundance ratios in HE\n1327-2326 may be used to constrain the properties of the supernova(e) that\nproduced its metals, but with some caution. \n\n"}

One mechanism to reconcile the simulations with\nthe observed data is the feedback from star formation, this might be successful\nin isolated dwarf galaxies but its success in LSB galaxies remains unclear.\nAdditionally, including too much feedback in the simulations is a double-edged\nsword, in order to obtain a cored DM distribution from an initially cuspy one,\nthe feedback recipes usually require to remove a large quantity of baryons from\nthe center of galaxies, however, some feedback recipes produce twice more\nsatellite galaxies of a given luminosity and with much smaller mass to light\nratios from those that are observed. Therefore, one DM profile that produces\ncores naturally and that does not require large amounts of feedback would be\npreferable.

The most attractive scenario for the origin of such a\nlarge scale field is the advection of the field by the gas in the accretion\ndisk from the interstellar medium or a companion star. However, it is realized\nthat outward diffusion of the accreted field is fast compared to the inward\naccretion velocity in a geometrically thin accretion disk if the value of the\nPrandtl number Pm is around unity. In this work, we revisit this problem\nconsidering the angular momentum of the disk is removed predominantly by the\nmagnetically driven outflows. The radial velocity of the disk is significantly\nincreased due to the presence of the outflows. Using a simplified model for the\nvertical disk structure, we find that even moderately weak fields can cause\nsufficient angular momentum loss via a magnetic wind to balance outward\ndiffusion. There are two equilibrium points, one at low field strengths\ncorresponding to a plasma-beta at the midplane of order several hundred, and\none for strong accreted fields, beta~1.

Abstract: High frequency soft reverberation lags have now been detected from stellar\nmass and super massive black holes. Their interpretation involves reflection of\na hard source of photons onto an accretion disk, producing a delayed reflected\nemission, with a time lag consistent with the light travel time between the\nirradiating source and the disk. Independently of the location of the clock,\nthe kHz Quasi-Periodic Oscillation (QPO) emission is thought to arise from the\nneutron star boundary layer. Here, we search for the signature of reverberation\nof the kHz QPO emission, by measuring the soft lags and the lag energy spectrum\nof the lower kHz QPOs from 4U1608-52. Soft lags, ranging from ~15 to ~40\nmicroseconds, between the 3-8 keV and 8-30 keV modulated emissions are detected\nbetween 565 and 890 Hz. The soft lags are not constant with frequency and show\na smooth decrease between 680 Hz and 890 Hz. The broad band X-ray spectrum is\nmodeled as the sum of a disk and a thermal comptonized component, plus a broad\niron line, expected from reflection. The spectral parameters follow a smooth\nrelationship with the QPO frequency, in particular the fitted inner disk radius\ndecreases steadily with frequency. Both the bump around the iron line in the\nlag energy spectrum, and the consistency between the lag changes and the\ninferred changes of the inner disk radius, from either spectral fitting or the\nQPO frequency, suggest that the soft lags may indeed involve reverberation of\nthe hard pulsating QPO source on the disk. \n\n"}

The combination of the latter two factors is often expressed in terms\nof $n_{\\rm eff}$ -- the \"effective number density of galaxies used for weak\nlensing measurements\". In this work, we estimate $n_{\\rm eff}$ for the Large\nSynoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) project, the most powerful ground-based\nlensing survey planned for the next two decades. We investigate how the\nfollowing factors affect the resulting $n_{\\rm eff}$ of the survey with\ndetailed simulations: (1) survey time, (2) shear measurement algorithm, (3)\nalgorithm for combining multiple exposures, (4) inclusion of data from multiple\nfilter bands, (5) redshift distribution of the galaxies, and (6) masking and\nblending. For the first time, we quantify in a general weak lensing analysis\npipeline the sensitivity of $n_{\\rm eff}$ to the above factors.\n  We find that with current weak lensing algorithms, expected distributions of\nobserving parameters, and all lensing data ($r$- and $i$-band, covering 18,000\ndegree$^{2}$ of sky) for LSST, $n_{\\rm eff} \\approx37$ arcmin$^{-2}$ before\nconsidering blending and masking, $n_{\\rm eff} \\approx31$ arcmin$^{-2}$ when\nrejecting seriously blended galaxies and $n_{\\rm eff} \\approx26$ arcmin$^{-2}$\nwhen considering an additional 15% loss of galaxies due to masking.

A \"sparse sampling\" method offers a more affordable solution to this\nproblem: within a survey footprint covering a given survey volume, Vsurvey, we\nobserve only a fraction of the volume. The distribution of observed regions\nshould be chosen such that their separation is smaller than the length scale\ncorresponding to the wavenumber of interest.

Abstract: X-ray surveys have revealed a new class of active galactic nuclei (AGN) with\na very low observed fraction of scattered soft X-rays, f_scat < 0.5%. Based on\nX-ray modeling these \"X-ray new-type\", or low observed X-ray scattering\n(hereafter:\"low-scattering\") sources have been interpreted as deeply-buried AGN\nwith a high covering factor of gas. In this paper we address the questions\nwhether the host galaxies of low-scattering AGN may contribute to the observed\nX-ray properties, and whether we can find any direct evidence for high covering\nfactors from the infrared (IR) emission. We find that X-ray low-scattering AGN\nare preferentially hosted by highly-inclined galaxies or merger systems as\ncompared to other Seyfert galaxies, increasing the likelihood that the\nline-of-sight toward the AGN intersects with high columns of host-galactic gas\nand dust. Moreover, while a detailed analysis of the IR emission of\nlow-scattering AGN ESO 103-G35 remains inconclusive, we do not find any\nindication of systematically higher dust covering factors in a sample of\nlow-scattering AGN based on their IR emission. For ESO 103-G35, we constrained\nthe temperature, mass and location of the IR emitting dust which is consistent\nwith expectations for the dusty torus. However, a deep silicate absorption\nfeature probably from much cooler dust suggests an additional screen absorber\non larger scales within the host galaxy. Taking these findings together, we\npropose that the low f_scat observed in low-scattering AGN is not necessarily\nthe result of circumnuclear dust but could originate from interference of\nhost-galactic gas with a column density of the order of 10^22 cm^-2 with the\nline-of-sight. We discuss implications of this hypothesis for X-ray models,\nhigh-ionization emission lines, and observed star-formation activity in these\nobjects. \n\n"}

Observationally, the nature of the corona is\nuncertain a priori, but a robust determination of the inner disk radius can be\nmade when the disc emissivity index is tightly constrained. When the inner disc\nis well illuminated, the black hole spin can also be determined. Using\nreflection modelling derived from ray tracing, we show that robust\ndetermination of disc truncation requires that the location of the coronal\nsource is quasi-static and at a height and radius less than the truncation\nradius of the disc.

This search yielded 186 nuclear flares in galaxies, of which\ntwo are excellent TDF candidates. Because of the systematic nature of the\nsearch, the very large number of galaxies, the long time of observation, and\nthe fact that non-TDFs were excluded without resorting to assumptions about TDF\ncharacteristics, this study provides an unparalleled opportunity to measure the\nTDF rate. To compute the rate of optical stellar tidal disruption events, we\nsimulate our entire pipeline to obtain the efficiency of detection.

Using only the observed part of the SDSS light curves gives a\nmodel-independent upper limit to the optical TDF rate: < 2 10^-4 per year per\ngalaxy (90% CL).

How such strong\nmagnetic fields can be generated and maintained is still an unsolved problem,\nwhich is, in principle, related to the interior structure of compact stars,\ni.e., the equation of state of cold matter at supra-nuclear density. In this\npaper we are trying to solve the problem in the regime of solid quark-cluster\nstars. Inside quark-cluster stars, the extremely low ratio of number density of\nelectrons to that of baryons $n_e/n_b$ and the screening effect from\nquark-clusters could reduce the long-range Coulomb interaction between\nelectrons to short-range interaction. In this case, the Stoner's model could\napply, and we find that the condition for ferromagnetism is consistent with\nthat for validity of Stoner's model. Under the screened Coulomb repulsion, the\nelectrons inside the stars could spontaneously magnetized and become\nferromagnetic, and hence would contribute non-zero net magnetic momentum to the\nwhole star. We conclude that, for most cases in solid quark-cluster stars, the\namount of net magnetic momentum, which is proportional to the amount of\nunbalanced spins $\\xi=(n_+-n_-)/n_e$ and depends on the number density of\nelectrons $n_e=n_++n_-$, could be significant with non-zero $\\xi$.

We consider\nthe effects of anisotropic radiation from accretion disks on the broad-line\nregion (BLR), from the Shakura-Sunyaev regime to slim disks with\nsuper-Eddington accretion rates. The geometrically thick funnel of the inner\nregion of slim disks produces strong self-shadowing effects that lead to very\nstrong anisotropy of the radiation field. We demonstrate that the degree of\nanisotropy of the radiation fields grows with increasing accretion rate. As a\nresult of this anisotropy, BLR clouds receive different spectral energy\ndistributions depending on their location relative to the disk, resulting in\ndiverse observational appearance of the BLR. We show that the self-shadowing of\nthe inner parts of the disk naturally produces two dynamically distinct regions\nof the BLR, depending on accretion rate. These two regions manifest themselves\nas kinematically distinct components of the broad H$\\beta$ line profile with\ndifferent line widths and fluxes, which jointly account for the Lorentzian\nprofile generally observed in narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies. In the time\ndomain, these two components are expected reverberate with different time lags\nwith respect to the varying ionizing continuum, depending on the accretion rate\nand the viewing angle of the observer. The diverse appearance of the BLR due to\nthe anisotropic ionizing energy source can be tested by reverberation mapping\nof H$\\beta$ and other broad emission lines (e.g., \\feii), providing a new tool\nto diagnose the structure and dynamics of the BLR.

The extraction of integrated intensities on five\ndifferent positions, corresponding to local maxima of CO emission, allows to\ncompare these intensities to the outputs of a grid of models, which combine an\nMHD shock code with a radiative transfer module based on the 'large velocity\ngradient' approximation. We find that the observed CO line emission is\ncompatible with non-stationary shocks and a pre-shock density of $10^4$\ncm${}^{-3}$. Our models furthermore allow to constrain shock ages, velocities,\nthe pre-shock magnetic field strength components perpendicular to the\nline-of-sight, and the full ladder of CO transitions. Finally, our analysis can\nbe used to estimate the contribution of such SNRs to, e.g. the galactic energy\nbalance and the momentum-injection into the surrounding interstellar medium. \n\n"}

Here we examine the behaviour in the fully nonlinear regime, of\ncollapsed objects that should mimic standard dark matter haloes. It is shown\nthat the pressure gradient associated with the unified dark matter fluid should\nbe significant in the outer parts of galaxies and clusters, and its effects\nobervable. In this case, no flat or falling rotation curve is possible for any\n(barotropic) equation of state with associated sound speed decreasing with\ndensity (a necessary condition if the fluid is to behave as pressureless matter\nat high density). The associated density profile is therefore also incompatible\nwith that inferred in the outer part of clusters.

As\nwith other CMSSM-like models, the measured Higgs mass requires supersymmetric\nparticle masses near or beyond the TeV scale.

Furthermore,\nSotani et al [PTEP 2014, 051E01 (2014)] recently found empirical formulas\nrelating the mass and surface redshift of nonrotating neutron stars to the\nstar's central density and to the parameter $\\eta\\equiv (K_0 L^2)^{1/3}$, where\n$K_0$ is the incompressibility of symmetric nuclear matter and $L$ is the slope\nof the symmetry energy at saturation density. Motivated by these\nconsiderations, we extend the work by Sotani et al to slowly rotating and\ntidally deformed neutron stars. We compute the moment of inertia, quadrupole\nmoment, quadrupole ellipticity, tidal and rotational Love number and apsidal\nconstant of slowly rotating neutron stars by integrating the Hartle-Thorne\nequations at second order in rotation, and we fit all of these quantities as\nfunctions of $\\eta$ and of the central density. These fits may be used to\nconstrain $\\eta$, either via observations of binary pulsars in the\nelectromagnetic spectrum, or via near-future observations of inspiralling\ncompact binaries in the gravitational-wave spectrum. \n\n"}

Based on UV-optical colours, it has\nbeen advocated that the UV haloes around spiral galaxies are due to UV\nradiation emitted from the disc and scattered off dust grains at high\nlatitudes. Detailed UV radiative transfer models that take into account\nscattering and absorption can explain the morphology of the UV haloes, and they\nrequire the presence of an additional thick dust disc next the to traditional\nthin disc for half of the galaxies in their sample. We test whether such an\nadditional thick dust disc agrees with the observed infrared emission in NGC\n3628, an edge-on galaxy with a clear signature of a thick dust disc. We extend\nthe far-ultraviolet radiative transfer models to full-scale panchromatic\nmodels. Our model, which contains no fine-tuning, can almost perfectly\nreproduce the observed spectral energy distribution from UV to mm wavelengths.\nThese results corroborate the interpretation of the extended UV emission in NGC\n3628 as scattering off dust grains, and hence of the presence of a substantial\namount of diffuse extra-planar dust. A significant caveat, however, is the\ngeometrical simplicity and non-uniqueness of our model: other models with a\ndifferent geometrical setting could lead to a similar spectral energy\ndistribution. More detailed radiative transfer simulations that compare the\nmodel results to images from UV to submm wavelengths are a way to break this\ndegeneracy, as are UV polarisation measurements. \n\n"}

Purpose: We want\nto investigate the influence of SRCs on the one-nucleon (1N) and two-nucleon\n(2N) knockout channel for muon-neutrino induced processes on a $^{12}$C target\nat energies relevant for contemporary measurements. Method: The model adopted\nin this work, corrects the impulse approximation for SRCs by shifting the com-\nplexity induced by the SRCs from the wave functions to the operators. Due to\nthe local character of the SRCs, it is argued that the expansion of these\noperators can be truncated at a low order.

We propose that the\ntransformation of NSCs into SMBHs occurs via runaway tidal captures, once NSCs\nexceed a certain critical central density and velocity dispersion. The\nbottleneck in this process, as with all collisional runaways, is growing the\nfirst e-fold in black hole mass. The growth of a stellar mass black hole past\nthis bottleneck occurs as tidally captured stars are consumed in repeated\nepisodes of mass transfer at pericenter. Tidal captures may turn off as a\ngrowth channel once the black hole reaches a mass ~100-1000 solar masses, but\ntidal disruption events will continue and appear capable of growing the seed\nSMBH to larger sizes. The runaway slows (becomes sub-exponential) once the seed\nSMBH consumes the core of its host NSC. While the bulk of the cosmic mass\ndensity in SMBHs is ultimately produced (via the Soltan-Paczynski argument) by\nepisodic gaseous accretion in very massive galaxies, the smallest SMBHs have\nprobably grown from strong tidal encounters with NSC stars. SMBH seeds that\ngrow for a time $t$ entirely through this channel will follow simple power law\nrelations with the velocity dispersion, $\\sigma$, of their host galaxy.

For larger\ncouplings the helicity of the magnetic field differs from the no-backreaction\nestimate and depends strongly on the comoving wavenumber. We estimate the\npost-inflationary evolution of the magnetic field based on known results for\nthe evolution of helical and non-helical magnetic fields.

Motivated\nby the recent release of unprecedentedly deep and wide imaging data around the\nPal~5 stellar stream, we develop a new probabilistic, adaptive and\nnon-parametric technique which allows us to bring the cluster's tidal tails\ninto clear focus. Strikingly, we uncover a stream whose density exhibits\nvisible changes on a variety of angular scales. We detect significant bumps and\ndips, both narrow and broad: two peaks on either side of the progenitor, each\nonly a fraction of a degree across, and two gaps, $\\sim2^{\\circ}$ and\n$\\sim9^{\\circ}$ wide, the latter accompanied by a gargantuan lump of debris.\nThis largest density feature results in a pronounced inter-tail asymmetry which\ncannot be made consistent with an unperturbed stream according to a suite of\nsimulations we have produced.

However, the situation is less understood in\ninteracting theories, especially on time scales longer than the dynamical\nrelaxation time. Recently there have been claims that the quantum theory\ndeviates spectacularly from the classical theory on this time scale, even if\nthe occupancy numbers are extremely large. Furthermore, it is claimed that the\nquantum theory quickly thermalizes while the classical theory does not. The\nevidence for these claims comes from noticing a spectacular difference in the\ntime evolution of expectation values of quantum operators compared to the\nclassical micro-state evolution. If true, this would have dramatic consequences\nfor many important phenomena, including laboratory studies of interacting BECs,\ndark matter axions, preheating after inflation, etc. In this work we critically\nexamine these claims.

The connection is that the expectation values of quantum operators in a\nsingle quantum micro-state are approximated by a corresponding classical\nensemble average over many classical micro-states. Furthermore, by the ergodic\ntheorem, a classical ensemble average of local fields with statistical\ntranslation invariance is the spatial average of a single micro-state.

The primary component is cold and collisionless. The\nsecondary component is also cold, but interacts strongly with dark radiation,\nwhich itself forms a tightly coupled fluid. The growth of density perturbations\nin the subdominant component is inhibited by dark acoustic oscillations due to\nits coupling to the dark radiation, solving the $\\sigma_8$ problem, while the\npresence of tightly coupled dark radiation ameliorates the $H_0$ problem. The\nsubdominant component of dark matter and dark radiation continue to remain in\nthermal equilibrium until late times, inhibiting the formation of a dark disk.\nWe present an example of a simple model that naturally realizes this scenario\nin which both constituents of dark matter are thermal WIMPs.

Abstract: We recently discovered that the active galactic nucleus (AGN) of Mrk 1018 has\nchanged optical type again after 30 years as a type 1 AGN. Here we combine\nChandra, NuStar, Swift, Hubble Space Telescope and ground-based observations to\nexplore the cause of this change. The 2-10keV flux declines by a factor of ~8\nbetween 2010 and 2016. We show with our X-ray observation that this is not\ncaused by varying neutral hydrogen absorption along the line-of-sight up to the\nCompton-thick level. The optical-UV spectral energy distributions are well fit\nwith a standard geometrically thin optically thick accretion disc model that\nseems to obey the expected $L\\sim T^4$ relation. It confirms that a decline in\naccretion disc luminosity is the primary origin for the type change. We detect\na new narrow-line absorber in Lya blue-shifted by ~700km/s with respect to the\nsystemic velocity of the galaxy. This new Lya absorber could be evidence for\nthe onset of an outflow or a companion black hole with associated gas that\ncould be related to the accretion rate change.

We aim\nto quantify the importance of a treatment of the ionisation fraction in\nturbulent magnetised media and investigate the effect of turbulence on shaping\nthe clouds and filaments before star formation sets in. In particular, we\ninvestigate how the structure, mass and width of filamentary structures depend\non the amount of turbulence in ionised media and the initial mass-to-flux\nratio. We compare the resulting density and mass-to-flux ratio structures both\nqualitatively and quantitatively via filament and core masses and filament\nfitting techniques (Gaussian and Plummer profiles.) We find that even with\nalmost no turbulence, filamentary structure still exists. Comparison of\nsimulations show that for turbulent Mach numbers above 2, there is little\nstructural difference between the Step-Like (SL) and Cosmic Ray only (CR-only)\nionisation models, while below this threshold the ionisation structure\nsignificantly affects the formation of filaments. Analysis of the mass within\ncores and filaments show decrease in mass as the degree of turbulence\nincreases. Finally, observed filaments within the Taurus L1495/B213 complex are\nbest reproduced by models with supercritical mass-to-flux ratios and/or at\nleast mildly supersonic turbulence, however, our models show that sterile\nfibres observed within Taurus may occur in highly ionised, subcritical\nenvironments. Based on this, we suggest that regions with fertile fibres likely\nindicate a trans- or supercritical mass-to-flux ratio within the region while\nsterile fibres are likely subcritical and transient. \n\n"}

We\nperform a suite of 3D MHD AMR simulations of AGN feedback in a cool core\ncluster including cosmic ray (CR) physics. CRs are supplied to the ICM via\ncollimated AGN jets and subsequently disperse in the magnetized ICM via\nstreaming, and interact with the ICM via hadronic, Coulomb, and streaming\ninstability heating. We find that CR transport is an essential model ingredient\nneeded for AGN feedback to self-regulate, at least within the context of the\nphysical model considered here. When CR streaming is neglected, the suppression\nof CR mixing with the ICM by magnetic fields significantly reduces ICM heating,\nwhich leads to cooling catastrophes. In the opposite case, CRs come into\ncontact with the ambient ICM and efficiently heat it, which results in globally\nstable atmospheres. Moreover, the dynamical state and intermittency of the\ncentral AGN are dramatically altered when CR streaming is present. We find that\nCR streaming heating dominates over the heating due to Coulomb and hadronic\nprocesses. Importantly, in simulations that include CR streaming, CR pressure\nsupport in the central 100 kpc is very low and does not demonstrably violate\nobservational constraints. On the contrary, when CR streaming is neglected, CR\nenergy is not spent on the ICM heating and CR pressure builds up to the level\nthat is in disagreement with the data. Overall, our models demonstrate that CR\nheating is a viable channel for the thermalization of AGN energy in clusters,\nand likely also in elliptical galaxies, and that CRs play an important role in\ndetermining AGN intermittency and the dynamical state of cool core atmospheres. \n\n"}

Under the assumption of a typical ISM\nCO-to-H$_2$ ratios of $10^{-4}$, the resulting gas masses are implausibly low,\nwith an average gas mass of $\\sim$ 0.05 M$_{Jup}$ as inferred from the average\nflux of stacked $^{13}$CO lines. The low gas masses and gas-to-dust ratios for\nCha I disks are both consistent with similar results from disks in the Lupus\nstar-forming region. The faint CO line emission may instead be explained if\ndisks have much higher gas masses, but freeze-out of CO or complex C-bearing\nmolecules is underestimated in disk models. The conversion of CO flux to CO gas\nmass also suffers from uncertainties in disk structures, which could affect gas\ntemperatures. CO emission lines will only be a good tracer of the disk mass\nwhen models for C and CO depletion are confirmed to be accurate. \n\n"}

The reverberation lag resulting from\nthe path length difference between direct and reflected emission provides a\npowerful tool to probe the innermost regions around both stellar-mass and\nsupermassive black holes.

Especially, the observation of GW170104\nsuggests dynamically assembled binaries favoring a distribution of misaligned\nspins. It has been argued that mergers of unassociated BHs can be engendered\nthrough a \"chance meeting\" in a multiple BH system under gas-rich environments.\nIn this paper, we consider the merger of unassociated BHs, concordant with the\nmassive BH merger events. To that end, we simulate a multiple BH system with a\npost-Newtonian $N$-body code incorporating gas accretion and general\nrelativistic effects.

Recently, some of the current authors proposed that the\nstochastic nature of the quantum vacuum can resolve this tension [Q, Wang, Z.\nZhu, and W. G. Unruh, Phys. Rev. D 95, 103504, 2017]. By treating the\nfluctuations in the vacuum seriously and allowing fluctuations up to some\nhigh-energy cutoff at which Quantum Field Theory is believed to break down, a\nparametric resonance effect arises that leads to a slow expansion and\nacceleration. In this work, we thoroughly examine the implications of this\nproposal by investigating the resulting dynamics. First, we improve upon\nnumerical calculations in the original work and show that convergence issues\nhad overshadowed some important effects. Correct calculations reverse some of\nthe conclusions in [Q. Wang, Z. Zhu, and W. G. Unruh, Phys. Rev.

Several sulfur-bearing molecules are observed in the interstellar\nmedium and in comets, in strong contrast to protoplanetary disks where only CS,\nH$_2$CS and SO have been detected so far. Aims. We combine observations and\nchemical models to constrain the sulfur abundances and their sensitivity to\nphysical and chemical conditions in the DM Tau protoplanetary disk. Methods. We\nobtained $0.5^{\"}$ ALMA observations of DM Tau in Bands 4 and 6 in lines of CS,\nSO, SO$_2$, OCS, CCS, H$_2$CS and H$_2$S, achieving a $\\sim 5$ mJy sensitivity.\nUsing the non-LTE radiative transfer code RADEX and the forward-modeling tool\nDiskFit, disk-averaged CS column densities and upper limits for the other\nspecies were derived. Results. Only CS was detected with a derived column\ndensity of $\\sim 2-6 \\times 10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$. We report a first tentative\ndetection of SO$_2$ in DM Tau. The upper limits range between $\\sim 10^{11}$\nand $10^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$ for the other S-bearing species. The best-fit chemical\nmodel matching these values requires a gas-phase C/O ratio of > 1 at $r \\sim\n50-100$ au. With chemical modeling we demonstrate that sulfur-bearing species\ncould be robust tracers of the gas-phase C/O ratio, surface reaction rates,\ngrain size and UV intensities. Conclusions. The lack of detections of a variety\nof sulfur-bearing molecules in DM Tau other than CS implies a dearth of\nreactive sulfur in the gas phase, either through efficient freeze-out or\nbecause most of the elemental sulfur is in other large species, as found in\ncomets. The inferred high CS/SO and CS/SO$_2$ ratios require a non-solar C/O\ngas-phase ratio of > 1, consistent with the recent observations of hydrocarbon\nrings in DM Tau. The stronger depletion of oxygen-bearing S-species compared to\nCS is likely linked to the low observed abundances of gaseous water in DM Tau\nand points to a removal mechanism of oxygen from the gas. \n\n"}

The spin polarization condensation arises due to a tensor type\ninteraction which may be generated due to non-perturbative effects in Quantum\nChromodynamics(QCD). In this investigation we have shown the interplay between\nchiral condensate and spin polarization condensation for different values of\ntensor coupling. Spin polarization in the case of 2+1 flavor is different from\ntwo flavor case because of additional F$_8$ condensate associated with\n$\\lambda_8^f$ flavor generator. We find a non-zero value of the two spin\ncondensates in the chirally restored phase. Beyond a certain temperature the\nspin polarization condensates vanish for rather large quark chemical\npotentials. The spin condensates affect the chiral phase transition, quark\nmasses, and the quark dispersion relation. The spin polarization condensate\nappears only in the chiral restored phase for light quarks. For large enough\ntensor couplings, it is observed that the spin polarization condensate acts as\na catalyst for chiral symmetry restoration. Thermodynamic behavior of $F_3$ and\n$F_8$ are found to be different and they affect the quark masses differently. \n\n"}

Such models combined with fairly well understood physics like the quark\nsubstructure of the nucleon and the nuclear form factor and the spin response\nfunction of the nucleus, permit the evaluation of the event rate for\nLSP-nucleus elastic scattering.

We assume that a central black-hole mass in NLS1 is\nrelatively small, $M \\sim 10^{5-7}M_\\odot$, and that a disk shines nearly at\nthe Eddington luminosity, $L_{\\rm E}$. Then, the disk becomes a slim disk and\nexhibits the following distinctive signatures: (1) The disk luminosity\n(particularly of X-rays) is insensitive to mass-flow rates, $\\dot M$, since the\ngenerated energy is partly carried away to the black hole by trapped photons in\naccretion flow. (2) The spectra are multi-color blackbody. The maximum\nblackbody temperature is $T_{\\rm bb} \\simeq 0.2(M/10^5 M_\\odot)^{-1/4}$ keV,\nand the size of the blackbody emitting region is small, $r_{\\rm bb} \\lsim 3\nr_{\\rm S}$ (with $r_{\\rm S}$ being Schwarzschild radius) even for a\nSchwarzschild black hole.

Super--sonic turbulence fragments\nMCs into dense sheets, filaments and cores and large low density ``voids'', via\nthe action of highly radiative shocks. We refer to this process as \"turbulent\nfragmentation\". In this work we derive the mass distribution of gravitationally\nunstable cores generated by the process of turbulent fragmentation. The mass\ndistribution above one solar mass depends primarily on the power spectrum of\nthe turbulent flow and on the jump conditions for isothermal shocks in a\nmagnetized gas. For a power spectrum index \\beta=-1.74, consistent with\nLarson's velocity dispersion--size relation as well as with new numerical and\nanalytic results on super--sonic turbulence, we obtain a power law mass\ndistribution of dense cores with a slope equal to 3/(4-\\beta) = 1.33,\nconsistent with the slope of the stellar IMF. Below one solar mass, the mass\ndistribution flattens and turns around at a fraction of a solar mass, as\nobserved for the stellar IMF in a number of stellar clusters, because only the\ndensest cores are gravitationally unstable. The mass distribution at low masses\nis determined by the probability distribution of the gas density, which is\nknown to be approximately Log--Normal for an isothermal turbulent gas. The\nintermittent nature of the turbulent density distribution is thus responsible\nfor the existence of a significant number of small collapsing cores, even of\nsub--stellar mass. Since turbulent fragmentation is unavoidable in\nsuper--sonically turbulent molecular clouds, and given the success of the\npresent model in predicting the observed shape of the stellar IMF, we conclude\nthat turbulent fragmentation is essential to the origin of the stellar IMF. \n\n"}

In contrast to the environment assumed in the\nBlandford-Znajek mechanism in which the rotating hole's spin axis and the\nasymptotic direction of the magnetic field are aligned, this new process\noperates when they are generally misaligned which obviously is the more natural\nsituation likely to happen.

OGLE-1999-BUL-19: The First\n  Multi-Peak Parallax Event Abstract: We describe a highly unusual microlensing event, OGLE-1999-BUL-19, which\nexhibits multiple peaks in its light curve. The Einstein radius crossing time\nfor this event is approximately one year, which is unusually long. We show that\nthe motion of the Earth induces these multiple peaks in the light curve, since\nthe relative transverse velocity of the lens projected into the observer plane\nis very small (v = 12.5 km/s). This is the lowest velocity so far published and\nwe believe that this is the first multiple-peak parallax event ever observed.\nWe also believe that this event may be exhibiting slight binary-source\nsignatures in addition to these parallax-induced multiple peaks. With\nspectroscopic observations it is possible to test this `parallax plus\nbinary-source' hypothesis and (if this hypothesis turns out to be correct) to\nsimultaneously fit both models and obtain a measurement of the lens mass.\nFurthermore, spectroscopic observations could also supply information regarding\nthe lens properties, possibly providing another avenue for determining the lens\nmass.

Previously, we performed numerical\nintegrations for the dynamical evolution of planetary systems containing two\ngiant planets of equal masses initially in nearly circular orbits very close to\nthe dynamical stability limit. We found the ratio of collisions to ejections in\nthese simulations was greater than the ratio of circular orbits to eccentric\norbits among the known extrasolar planets.

Namely, we consider the dependence of their total luminosity\nL_tot=SUM(L_k) and of fractional rms_tot of their variability on the number of\nsources N or, equivalently, on the normalization of the luminosity function. We\nshow that due to small number statistics a regime exists, in which L_tot grows\nnon-linearly with N, in an apparent contradiction with the seemingly obvious\nprediction <L_tot>=integral(dN/dL*L*dL) ~ N. In this non-linear regime, the\nrms_tot decreases with N significantly more slowly than expected from the rms ~\n1/sqrt(N) averaging law. For example, for a power law luminosity function with\na slope of a=3/2, in the non-linear regime, L_tot ~ N^2 and the rms_tot does\nnot depend at all on the number of sources N. Only in the limit of N>>1 do\nthese quantities behave as intuitively expected, L_tot ~ N and rms_tot ~\n1/sqrt(N). We give exact solutions and derive convenient analytical\napproximations for L_tot and rms_tot.\n  Using the total X-ray luminosity of a galaxy due to its X-ray binary\npopulation as an example, we show that the Lx-SFR and Lx-M* relations predicted\nfrom the respective ``universal'' luminosity functions of high and low mass\nX-ray binaries are in a good agreement with observations. Although caused by\nsmall number statistics the non-linear regime in these examples extends as far\nas SFR<4-5 Msun/yr and log(M*/Msun)<10.0-10.5, respectively. \n\n"}

In\nparticular, we demonstrate the formation of a well-resolved disk galaxy. The\nsurface brightness profile of the galaxy is exponential, with a B-band central\nsurface brightness of 21.0 mag arcsec^-2 and a scale-length of R_d = 2.0 h^-1\nkpc. We find no evidence for a significant bulge component. The simulated\ngalaxy falls within the I-band Tully-Fisher relation, with an absolute\nmagnitude of I = -21.2 and a peak stellar rotation velocity of V_rot=121.3 km\ns^-1. While the total specific angular momentum of the stars in the galaxy\nagrees with observations, the angular momentum in the inner regions appears to\nbe low by a factor of ~2. The star formation rate of the galaxy peaks at ~7\nM_sun yr^-1 between redshifts z=2-4, with the mean stellar age decreasing from\n\\~10 Gyrs in the outer regions of the disk to ~7.5 Gyrs in the center,\nindicating that the disk did not simply form inside-out.

If ISM gas is instead modeled\nwith an isothermal equation of state, or if star formation is suppressed\nentirely, growing gaseous disks quickly violate the Toomre stability criterion\nand undergo catastrophic fragmentation. \n\n"}

We argue that when SNe\nexplode the star-forming cloud has already been partially destroyed by ionizing\nlight and winds from massive stars.

The comparison with statistical measurements allows us to\nconstrain certain parameters related to analytical descriptions that describe\nthe relation between a dark matter halo and its central galaxy luminosity, its\nsatellite galaxy luminosity, and the fraction of early- and late-type galaxies\nof that halo.

During reionization peculiar motion of free electrons induces the\nDoppler anisotropy of the CMB, while density fluctuations of neutral hydrogen\ninduce the 21-cm line anisotropy. In our simplified model of inhomogeneous\nreionization, a positive correlation arises as the universe reionizes whereas a\nnegative correlation arises as it recombines; thus, the sign of the correlation\nprovides information on the reionization history which cannot be obtained by\npresently. The signal comes mainly from large scales (k~0.01 Mpc^-1) where\nlinear perturbation theory is valid and complexity due to patchy reionization\nis averaged out. Since the Doppler signal comes from ionized regions and the\n21-cm comes from neutral ones, the correlation has a well-defined peak(s) in\nredshift when the ionization fraction of the universe is about half.\nFurthermore, the cross-correlation is much less sensitive to systematic errors,\nespecially foreground emission, than the auto-correlation of 21-cm lines: this\nis analogous to the temperature-polarization correlation of the CMB being more\nimmune to systematic errors than the polarization-polarization. Therefore, we\nargue that the Doppler-21cm correlation provides a robust measurement of the\n21-cm anisotropy, which can also be used as a diagnostic tool for detected\nsignals in the 21-cm data -- detection of the cross-correlation provides the\nstrongest confirmation that the signal is of cosmological origin.

As the initial condition for our\nsimulations, we set up spatially uniform gas with thermally unstable\ntemperature in a box with periodic boundaries. After the linear growth stage of\nthe thermal instability, two-phase medium forms where cold clumps are embedded\nin warm medium, and turbulent fluid flow clearly visible as translational\nmotions of the cold clumps does not decay in a viscous dissipation timescale.\nThe amplitude of the turbulent velocity increases when we reduce the Prandtl\nnumber that is the non-dimensional ratio of kinetic viscosity to thermal\nconduction: the saturation amplitude does not change when we increase the\nviscosity and thermal conduction coefficients simultaneously in order to keep\nthe Prandtl number.

Very deep three-dimensional spectra and maps clearly show that the\nBAL systems I and II are extended (reaching 1.4-1.6\" = 1.2-1.3 kpc, from the\nnucleus) and clearly elongated at the position angle close to the radio jet PA.\nWhich suggest that the BAL systems I and II are both associated with the radio\njet, and supporting the bipolar jet-wind model for some BALs. For the nuclear\nregion of Mrk 231, the QSO and host-galaxy components were modelled, using a\nnew technique of decoupling 3D spectra. From this study, the following main\nresults were found: (i) in the pure host galaxy spectrum an extreme nuclear\nstarburst component was clearly observed, mainly as a very strong increase in\nthe flux, at the blue wavelengths; (ii) the BAL system I is observed in the\nspectrum of the host galaxy; (iii) in the clean/pure QSO emission spectrum,\nonly broad lines were detected. 3D GMOS individual spectra (specially in the IR\nCa II triplet) and maps confirm the presence of an extreme and young nuclear\nstarburst (8 < age < 15 Myr), which was detected mainly in a ring or toroid\nwith a radius r = 0.3\" = 200 pc, around the very nucleus.

The variability is\ndominated by short timescales, ~10s, although a weak superhump also appears to\nbe present in the optical. The optical rapid variations, at least, are well\ncorrelated with those in X-rays. Infrared JHKs photometry, as in the previous\noutburst, exhibits especially large amplitude variability. The spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) of the variable infrared component can be fitted with a\npower-law of slope alpha=-0.78 where Fnu is proportional to nu^alpha. There is\nno compelling evidence for evolution in the slope over five nights, during\nwhich time the source brightness decayed along almost the same track as seen in\nvariations within the nights. We conclude that both short-term variability, and\nlonger timescale fading, are dominated by a single component of constant\nspectral shape. We cannot fit the SED of the IR variability with a credible\nthermal component, either optically thick or thin.

The question of what\nthe dynamical consequences were for these target minihaloes, of their exposure\nto the ionizing and dissociating starlight from the Pop III star requires a\nfull radiation-hydrodynamics calculation. Towards this end, we have performed a\nseries of detailed, 1D, radiation-hydrodynamical simulations. We have varied\nthe distance to the source (and, hence, the flux) and the mass and evolutionary\nstage of the target haloes to quantify this effect. We find: (1) trapping of\nthe I-front and its transformation from R-type to D-type, preceded by a shock\nfront; (2) photoevaporation of the ionized gas (i.e. all gas originally located\noutside the trapping radius); (3) formation of an H_2 precursor shell which\nleads the I-front, stimulated by partial photoionization; and (4) the\nshock-induced formation of H_2 in the minihalo neutral core when the shock\nspeeds up and partially ionizes the gas. The fate of the neutral core is mostly\ndetermined by the response of the core to this shock front, which leads to\nmolecular cooling and collapse that, when compared to the same halo without\nexternal radiation, is either: (a) expedited, (b) delayed, (c) unaltered, or\n(d) reversed or prevented, depending upon the flux (i.e. distance to the\nsource) and the halo mass and evolutionary stage. Roughly speaking, most haloes\nthat were destined to cool, collapse, and form stars in the absence of external\nradiation are found to do so even when exposed to the first Pop III star in\ntheir neighborhood, while those that would not have done so are still not able\nto.

Abstract: Many nearby early-type (elliptical and S0) galaxies contain weak\n(milli-Jansky level) nuclear radio sources on scales a few hundred parsecs or\nless. The origin of the radio emission, however, has remained unclear,\nespecially in volume-limited samples that select intrinsically less luminous\ngalaxies. Both active galactic nuclei and nuclear star formation have been\nsuggested as possible mechanisms for producing the radio emission. This paper\nutilizes optical spectroscopic information to address this issue. A substantial\nfraction of the early-type galaxies surveyed with the Very Large Array by\nWrobel & Heeschen (1991) exhibits detectable optical emission lines in their\nnuclei down to very sensitive limits. Comparison of the observed radio\ncontinuum power with that expected from the thermal gas traced by the optical\nemission lines implies that the bulk of the radio emission is nonthermal. Both\nthe incidence and the strength of optical line emission correlate with the\nradio power. At a fixed line luminosity, ellipticals have stronger radio cores\nthan S0s. The relation between radio power and line emission observed in this\nsample is consistent with the low-luminosity extension of similar relations\nseen in classical radio galaxies and luminous Seyfert nuclei. A plausible\ninterpretation of this result is that the weak nuclear sources in nearby\nearly-type galaxies are the low-luminosity counterparts of more powerful AGNs.\nThe spectroscopic evidence supports this picture. Most of the emission-line\nobjects are optically classified as Seyfert nuclei or low-ionization nuclear\nemission-line regions (LINERs), the majority of which are likely to be\naccretion-powered sources. \n\n"}

In this paper it\nis suggested, on the basis of current evidence and theory, that the IMF has a\nuniversal Salpeter-like form at the upper end but flattens below a\ncharacteristic stellar mass that may vary with time. Much of the evidence that\nhas been attributed to a top-heavy early IMF, including the ubiquitous G-dwarf\nproblem, the high abundance of heavy elements in clusters of galaxies, and the\nhigh rate of formation of massive stars in high-redshift galaxies, can be\naccounted for with such an IMF if the characteristic stellar mass was several\ntimes higher during the early stages of galaxy evolution.

By exploiting the nearly unique\nbroad-band properties of High-Energy Peaked (HBL) BL Lacs we have statistically\nidentified a sample of 218 objects that is expected to include about 85% of BL\nLacs and that is therefore several times larger than all other published\nsamples of HBLs.

We\nfind that the LogN-LogS flattens around 20 mJy and that <V/Vm> = 0.42 +/- 0.02.\nThis extends to the radio band earlier results, based on much smaller X-ray\nselected samples, about the anomalous cosmological observational properties of\nHBL BL Lacs. A comparison with the expected radio LogN-LogS of all BL Lacs\n(based on a beaming model) shows that extreme HBLs make up roughly 2% of the BL\nLac population, independently of radio flux. This result, together with the\nflatness of the radio logN-logS at low fluxes, is in contrast with the\npredictions of a recent model which assumes an anti-correlation between peak\nfrequency and bolometric luminosity.

Observationally one can find evidence that supports\nthese assumptions on very large scales, the strongest being the almost isotropy\nof the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation after assigning the whole dipole\nto our proper motion relative to this background. However, on small and on\nintermediate scales up to several hundreds of Mpcs, there are strong deviations\nfrom homogeneity and isotropy.

For\nNewtonian fluid dynamics the averaging procedure has been discussed in detail\nin Buchert and Ehlers (1997), leading to an additional backreaction term in the\nFriedmann equation.

By computing the bispectrum statistic as a function of various data\npartitions - by channel, frequency, and time interval, we show that the\nobserved non-Gaussian signal is driven by the 53 GHz data. This frequency\ndependence strongly rejects the hypothesis that the signal is cosmological in\norigin. A jack-knife analysis of the coadded 53 and 90 GHz sky maps reveals\nthose sky pixels to which the bispectrum statistic is particularly sensitive.\nWe find that by removing data from the 53 GHz sky maps for periods of time\nduring which a known systematic effect perturbs the 31 GHz channels, the\namplitudes of the bispectrum coefficients become completely consistent with\nthat expected for a Gaussian sky. We conclude that the non-Gaussian signal\ndetected by the normalised bispectrum statistic in the publicly available DMR\nsky maps is due to a systematic artifact. The impact of removing the affected\ndata on estimates of the normalisation of simple models of cosmological\nanisotropy is negligible. \n\n"}

I propose that this\ncorrelation results from dust formation above magnetic cool spots. The model\ndeals with elliptical PNs, but not with bipolar PNs. The basic assumption is\nthat a weak dynamo amplifies magnetic fields in AGB stars, such that magnetic\ncool spots are formed, mainly near the equatorial plane. Enhanced dust\nformation above these cool spots leads to a higher mass loss rate in the\nequatorial plane, resulting in the formation of an elliptical PN. The dust\nformation above cool spots becomes much more efficient when mass loss rate is\nhigh. In addition to explaining the correlation, the model has the advantage\nthat it can operate for very slowly rotating AGB stars, having rotation\nvelocities of less than $10^{-4}$ times the break-up velocity. Such velocities\ncan be achieved by a planet companion of mass $\\sim 0.1 M_{\\rm Jupiter}$ which\nspins-up the envelope, or even from singly evolved stars which leave the main\nsequence with a high rotation velocity. The sporadic nature of magnetic cool\nspots also leads to the formation of filaments, arcs, and clumps in the\ndescendant PN.

The uncertainties in the equilibrium\nconfiguration (Z,R_c) of the crust, where Z is the proton charge and R_c the\nradius of the Wigner-Seitz cell, correspond to variation of Z by 2 -- 6 units\nand of R_c, by 1 -- 2 fm. The effect of the boundary conditions is enhanced at\nincreasing density. These uncertainties are smaller than the variation of Z and\nR_c coming from the inclusion of pairing.
