The first paradox concerns the\napparent non-existence of the signature of the electron pockets in angle\nresolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). The second paradox is a clear\nsignature of a small electron pocket in quantum oscillation experiments, but no\nevidence as yet of the corresponding hole pockets of approximately double the\nfrequency of the electron pocket. This hole pockets should be present if the\nFermi surface reconstruction is due to a commensurate density wave, assuming\nthat Luttinger sum rule relating the area of the pockets and the total number\nof charge carriers holds. Here we provide possible resolutions of these\napparent paradoxes from the commensurate $d$-density wave theory. To address\nthe first paradox we have computed the ARPES spectral function subject to\ncorrelated disorder, natural to a class of experiments relevant to the\nmaterials studied in quantum oscillations. The intensity of the spectral\nfunction is significantly reduced for the electron pockets for an intermediate\nrange of disorder correlation length, and typically less than half the hole\npocket is visible, mimicking Fermi arcs. Next we show from an exact transfer\nmatrix calculation of the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillation that the usual disorder\naffects the electron pocket more significantly than the hole pocket. However,\nwhen, in addition, the scattering from vortices in the mixed state is included,\nit wipes out the frequency corresponding to the hole pocket. Thus, if we are\ncorrect, it will be necessary to do measurements at higher magnetic fields and\neven higher quality samples to recover the hole pocket frequency. \n\n"}

Its true nature depends critically on the\nbulk and surface state band topology.

For instance, for the\ndouble pulsar PSR J0737-3039A/B we find at the 68% confidence level that the\nmasses are bounded by 1.28 < m_A/m_sun < 1.34 and 1.19 < m_B/m_sun < 1.25,\nwhile the scalar-charge to mass ratios satisfy |a_A| < 0.21, |a_B| < 0.21 and\n|a_B - a_A| < 0.002$.

Such products are often formulated in terms of the areas of inner\n(Cauchy) horizons and outer (event) horizons, and sometimes include the effects\nof unphysical \"virtual\" horizons. But the conjectured mass-independence\nsometimes fails. Specifically, for the Schwarzschild-de Sitter [Kottler] black\nhole in (3+1) dimensions it is shown by explicit exact calculation that the\nproduct of event horizon area and cosmological horizon area is not mass\nindependent. (Including the effect of the third \"virtual\" horizon does not\nimprove the situation.)

In these examples the main improvements\narise from a conjectured duality between color and kinematics. In this paper we\ninitiate the systematic study of quite general powercounting under the\nassumption that color-kinematic duality exists. The main technical tool is a\nreformulation of the duality in terms of linear maps, modulo subtleties at loop\nlevel mostly inherent to the duality. This tool may have wider applications in\nboth gauge and gravity theories, up to resolution of the subtleties. Here it is\nfirst applied to the large Britto-Cachazo-Feng-Witten (BCFW) shift behavior of\ngravity integrands constructed through the duality.

The cancellations\nobtained in these estimates depends on the exact implementation of the duality\nat loop level, especially on graph topology.

Is this a generic feature of any gravitational theory? Is the\nprescription applicable to other gravities? In this paper we would like to\naddress the above questions by examining the same procedure for Horava-Lifshitz\ngravity. We find that in Horava-Lifshitz gravity, this approach does not work\nand we fail to reproduce a corresponding Friedmann equation in this theory by\napplying the first law of thermodynamics on the apparent horizon, together with\nthe appropriate expression for the entropy in Horava-Lifshitz gravity.

The\nkey point is that the locus of emission of Hawking radiation is not the\nglobally defined event horizon. Rather the emission domain lies just outside a\ntimelike Marginal Outer Trapped Surface that is locally defined. The emission\ndomain is mainly located inside the event horizon. A spacelike singularity\nforms behind the event horizon, and most of the Hawking radiation ends up at\nthis singularity rather than at infinity. Whether any Hawking radiation reaches\ninfinity depends on the relation between the emission domain and the event\nhorizon. From the outside view, even if radiation is seen as always being\nemitted, the black hole never evaporates away, rather its mass and entropy\nasymptote to finite non-zero limits, and the event horizon always acts as a\nsink for matter and information. From an inside view, the matter and\ninformation disappear into the singularity, which is the boundary of spacetime.\nThe argument is based on the nature of the processes at work plus a careful\ndelineation of the relevant causal domains; in order to confirm this model and\ndetermine details of the outcome, detailed calculations of the expectation\nvalue of the stress-energy-momentum tensor are needed to determine back\nreaction effects. \n\n"}

We show that several superfluid phases that may\narise in this phase can be treated within a controlled BCS mean field theory,\nwith the strength of the spin-triplet nematic order parameter playing the role\nof the small parameter of this theory. We find that in a spin-triplet nematic\nphase, in addition of a triplet $p$-wave and spin-singlet $d$-wave (or $s$\ndepending on the nematic phase) uniform superconducting states, it is also\npossible to have a $d$-wave (or $s$) PDW superconductor. The PDW phases found\nhere can be either unidirectional, bidirectional or tridirectional depending on\nthe spin-triplet nematic phase and which superconducting channel is dominant.\nIn addition, a triple-helix state is found in a particular channel. We show\nthat these PDW phases are present in the weak coupling limit, in contrast to\nthe usual Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov phases which require strong coupling\nphysics in addition to a large magnetic field (and often both). \n\n"}

Model selection tools in\none-on-one comparisons favor R_h=ct with a likelihood of ~90% versus only ~10%\nfor LCDM. Nonetheless, the predictions of LCDM often come quite close to those\nof R_h=ct, suggesting that its parameters are optimized to mimic the w=-1/3\nequation of state. In this paper, we demonstrate that the equation of state in\nR_h=ct helps us to understand why the optimized fraction Omega_m=rho_m/rho in\nLCDM must be ~0.27, an otherwise seemingly random variable. We show that when\none forces LCDM to satisfy the equation of state w=(rho_r/3-rho_de)/rho, the\nvalue of the Hubble radius today, c/H_0, can equal its measured value ct_0 only\nwith Omega_m~0.27 when the equation of state for dark energy is w_de=-1. This\npeculiar value of Omega_m therefore appears to be a direct consequence of\ntrying to fit the data with the equation of state w=(rho_r/3-rho_de)/rho in a\nUniverse whose principal constraint is instead R_h=ct or, equivalently, w=-1/3. \n\n"}

Such\napproximately universal relations are useful to break degeneracies in data\nanalysis for future radio, X-ray and gravitational wave observations. Although\nthe pressure inside compact stars is most likely nearly isotropic, certain\nscenarios have been put forth that suggest otherwise, for example due to phase\ntransitions. We here investigate whether pressure anisotropy affects the\napproximate universal relations and whether it prevents their use in future\nobservations. We achieve this by numerically constructing slowly-rotating and\ntidally-deformed, anisotropic, compact stars in General Relativity to third\norder in spin. We find that anisotropy affects the universal relations only\nweakly; the relations become less universal by a factor of 1.5-3 relative to\nthe isotropic case, but remain approximately universal to 10%. We succeed in\nexplaining this increase in variability as an increase in the eccentricity\nvariation of isodensity contours, which provides further support for the\nemergent approximate symmetry explanation of universality.

Compared to the iron pnictides,\nthese systems have only electron Fermi pockets (i.e. no hole Fermi pockets) but\ncomparable superconducting transition temperatures. The challenge lies in\nreconciling the two basic experimental features of their superconducting state:\na node-less gap and the existence of a resonance in the spin excitation\nspectrum. We propose a mechanism based on reconstructing two quasi-degenerate\npairing states, one in an $s$-wave $A_{1g}$ channel that is fully gapped, and\nthe other in a $d$-wave $B_{1g}$ channel whose pairing function changes sign\nacross the electron Fermi pockets at the Brillouin-zone boundary. The resulting\nintermediate pairing state, which we call an orbital-selective $s \\times\n\\tau_3$ state, incorporates both of the above two properties. When the leading\nspin-singlet pairing is in the $d_{xz}, d_{yz}$ orbital subspace, this state\nretains the $s$-wave form factor but has a $B_{1g}$ symmetry due to an internal\n$\\tau_3$ structure in the orbital space.

The robust s-wave pairing throughout the different\nfamilies of iron-based superconductors at different doping regions signals two\nfundamental principles behind high T_c superconducting mechanisms: (1) the\ncorrespondence principle: the short range magnetic exchange interactions and\nthe Fermi surfaces act collaboratively to achieve high T_c superconductivity\nand determine pairing symmetries; (2) the magnetic selection pairing rule: the\nsuperconductivity is only induced by the magnetic exchange couplings from the\nsuperexchange mechanism through cation-anion-cation chemical bondings. These\nprinciples explain why the unconventional high T_c superconductivity appears to\nbe such a rare but robust phenomena with its strict requirement on electronic\nenvironment.

After discussing the motivation and general\naspects of our approach we present a detailed analysis of the prototype\n(quantum) Nonlinear Field Space Theory of a scalar field on the Minkowski\nbackground.

Namely, the linearized field equations\nhave spurious solutions which cannot be obtained from the linearization of\nexact solutions. In practice, one can show the failure of the linear\nperturbation theory by showing that a certain quadratic (integral) constraint\non the linearized solutions is not satisfied. For non-compact Cauchy surfaces,\nthe situation is different and for example, Minkowski space having a\nnon-compact Cauchy surface, is linearization stable. Here we study, the\nlinearization instability in generic metric theories of gravity where\nEinstein's theory is modified with additional curvature terms. We show that,\nunlike the case of general relativity, for modified theories even in the\nnon-compact Cauchy surface cases, there are some theories which show\nlinearization instability about their anti-de Sitter backgrounds.

One key difference lies in the role of Goldstone bosons, which for\nspacetime symmetries includes a subset which are inessential for the non-linear\nrealisation and hence can be eliminated. In this paper we address two important\nissues that arise when eliminating inessential Goldstones.\n  The first concerns the elimination itself, which is often performed by\nimposing so-called inverse Higgs constraints. Contrary to claims in the\nliterature, there are a series of conditions on the structure constants which\nmust be satisfied to employ the inverse Higgs phenomenon, and we discuss which\nparametrisation of the coset element is the most effective in this regard. We\nalso consider generalisations of the standard inverse Higgs constraints, which\ncan include integrating out inessential Goldstones at low energies, and prove\nthat under certain assumptions these give rise to identical effective field\ntheories for the essential Goldstones.\n  Secondly, we consider mappings between non-linear realisations that differ\nboth in the coset element and the algebra basis. While these can always be\nrelated to each other by a point transformation, remarkably, the inverse Higgs\nconstraints are not necessarily mapped onto each other under this\ntransformation.

{"id": "1801.03396", "contents": "Title: Evolution equations from an epistemic treatment of time Abstract: Relativistically, time $t$ is an observable just like position $r$. In\nquantum theory, $t$ is a parameter, in contrast to the observable $r$. This\ndiscrepancy suggests that there exists a more elaborate formalization of time,\nwhich encapsulates both perspectives. Such a formalization is proposed in this\npaper. The evolution is described in terms of sequential time $n\\in\n\\mathbf{\\mathbb{N}}$, which is updated each time an event occurs. Sequential\ntime $n$ is separated from relational time $t$, which describes distances\nbetween events in space-time. There is a space-time associated with each $n$,\nin which $t$ represents the knowledge at time $n$ about temporal relations. The\nevolution of the wave function is described in terms of the parameter $\\sigma$\nthat interpolates between sequential times $n$. For a free object we obtain a\nStueckelberg equation\n$\\frac{d}{d\\sigma}\\Psi(r_{4},\\sigma)=\\frac{ic^{2}\\hbar}{2\\langle\n\\epsilon\\rangle}\\Box\\Psi(r_{4},\\sigma)$, where $r_{4}=(r,ict)$.

The parametrization is assumed to be\nnatural, meaning that $\\frac{d}{d\\sigma}\\langle t\\rangle=1$, where $\\langle\nt\\rangle$ is the expected temporal distance between the events that define $n$\nand $n+m$.

We show that a unified theory of the diverse broken symmetry states\nnecessarily requires explicit incorporation of strong electron-electron\ninteractions and lattice discreteness, and most importantly, the correct\nbandfilling of one-quarter. Uniquely in the quarter-filled band, there is a\nvery strong tendency to form nearest neighbor spin-singlets, in both one and\ntwo dimensions. The tendency to spin-singlets, a quantum effect, drives a\ncommensurate charge-order in the correlated quarter-filled band. This\ncharge-ordered spin-singlet, which we label as a paired-electron crystal (PEC),\nis different from and competes with both the antiferromagnetic state and the\nWigner crystal of single electrons. Further, unlike these classical broken\nsymmetries, the PEC is characterized by a spin gap. The tendency to the PEC in\ntwo dimensions is enhanced by lattice frustration. Following this\ncharacterization of the spatial broken symmetries, we critically reexamine\nspin-fluctuation and resonating valence bond theories of frustration-driven SC\nwithin half-filled band Hubbard and Hubbard-Heisenberg Hamiltonians for the\nsuperconducting CTS. We develop a valence-bond theory of SC within which the\nsuperconducting state is reached by the destabilization of the PEC by\nadditional pressure-induced lattice frustration that makes the spin-singlets\nmobile. Our proposed mechanism for SC is the same for CTS in which the\nproximate semiconducting state is antiferromagnetic instead of charge-ordered,\nwith the only difference that SC in the former is generated via a fluctuating\nspin-singlet state as opposed to static PEC. \n\n"}

Nonetheless, one may expect sequences of bits generated by\nQRNGs to have properties that pseudo-random sequences do not; indeed,\npseudo-random sequences are necessarily computable, a highly nontypical\nproperty of sequences.\n  In this paper, we discuss the differences between QRNGs and PRNGs and the\nchallenges involved in certifying the quality of QRNGs theoretically and\ntesting their output experimentally. While QRNGs are often tested with standard\nsuites of statistical tests, such tests are designed for PRNGs and only verify\nstatistical properties of a QRNG, but are insensitive to many supposed\nadvantages of QRNGs.

These codes behave similarly to previous holographic tensor\nnetwork toy models, but describe actual bulk excitations in continuum AdS/CFT.\n  By assuming some natural generalizations of the 'holographic entanglement of\npurification' conjecture, we are able to construct tensor networks for more\ngeneral bulk discretizations, leading to finer-grained networks that partition\nthe information content of a Ryu-Takayanagi surface into tensor-factorized\nsubregions. While the granularity of such a tensor network must be set larger\nthan the string/Planck scales, we expect that it can be chosen to lie well\nbelow the AdS scale. However, we also prove a no-go theorem which shows that\nthe bulk-to-boundary maps cannot all be isometries in a tensor network with\nintersecting Ryu-Takayanagi surfaces. \n\n"}

However, quantum mechanically there are at least two notions\nof information gathering which can be considered, one characterizing the\ninformation provided about the initial preparation, useful in communication,\nand the other characterizing the information about the final state, useful in\nstate-preparation and control. Here we are interested in understanding the\nproperties of these measures, and the information gathering capacities of\nquantum and classical measurements. We provide a partial answer to the question\n`in what sense does information gain increase with initial uncertainty?' by\nshowing that, for classical and quantum measurements which are symmetric with\nrespect to reversible transformations of the state space, the information gain\nregarding the initial state always increases with the observer's initial\nuncertainty. In addition, we calculate the capacity of all unitarily covariant\nand commutative permutation-symmetric measurements for obtaining classical\ninformation. While it is the von Neumann entropy of the effects which appears\nin the latter capacity, it is the subentropy which appears in the expression\nfor the former. \n\n"}

We show that the optimal measurement for\nsolving this problem is the so-called pretty good measurement. We then prove\nthat the success probability of this measurement exhibits a sharp threshold as\na function of the density nu=k/log N, where k is the number of copies of the\nhidden subgroup state and 2N is the order of the dihedral group. In particular,\nfor nu<1 the optimal measurement (and hence any measurement) identifies the\nhidden subgroup with a probability that is exponentially small in log N, while\nfor nu>1 the optimal measurement identifies the hidden subgroup with a\nprobability of order unity. Thus the dihedral group provides an example of a\ngroup G for which Omega(log|G|) hidden subgroup states are necessary to solve\nthe hidden subgroup problem. We also consider the optimal measurement for\ndetermining a single bit of the answer, and show that it exhibits the same\nthreshold. Finally, we consider implementing the optimal measurement by a\nquantum circuit, and thereby establish further connections between the dihedral\nhidden subgroup problem and average case subset sum problems. In particular, we\nshow that an efficient quantum algorithm for a restricted version of the\noptimal measurement would imply an efficient quantum algorithm for the subset\nsum problem, and conversely, that the ability to quantum sample from subset sum\nsolutions allows one to implement the optimal measurement. \n\n"}

It is shown that the decoherence depends strongly and\nsensitively on the structure of environment. Nonadiabatic effect is treated\nthrough the introduction of a function $\\xi_k$ which depends on the boson\nfrequency and renormalized tunneling. The results are as follows:(1) the\nnon-equilibrium correlation function $P(t)$, the dynamical susceptibility\n$\\chi''(\\omega)$ and the equilibrium correlation function $C(t)$ are\nanalytically obtained for $s\\leq 1$; (2) the phase diagram of thermodynamic\ntransition shows the delocalized-localized transition point $\\alpha_l$ which\nagrees with exact results and numerical data from the Numerical Renormalization\nGroup; (3) the dynamical transition point $\\alpha_c$ between coherent and\nincoherent phase is explicitly given for the first time.
