However, determination of the azimuth quadrupole with 2D\nangular autocorrelations, which accurately distinguish ``flow'' (quadrupole)\nfrom ``nonflow'' (minijets), contradicts conventional interpretations.\nCentrality trends may depend only on the initial parton geometry, and methods\nused to isolate flow fluctuations are sensitive instead mainly to minijet\ncorrelations.

J/psi suppression\nmechanisms based on energy density (such as color screening, interaction with\nco-movers, etc.) predict the opposite trend. On the other hand, it is expected\nthat more c\\bar{c} pairs should be available to form quarkonia at mid-rapidity\nvia recombination. Some models provide a way to differentiate J/psi production\nfrom initially produced c\\bar{c} pairs and final state recombination of\nuncorrelated pairs, via the rapidity and transverse momentum dependence of the\nelliptic flow (v2).\n  During 2007 data taking at RHIC, a large sample of Au+Au collisions at\nsqrt(sNN)=200 GeV was collected.

We found an\nasymmetric ridge with maximum asymmetry at $\\phi_s\\approx45^{\\circ}$ concurrent\nwith a symmetric jet at all $\\phi_s$. \n\n"}

The Yukawa couplings of the triplet fermion and the\nleft-handed neutrinos with the doublet Higgs field produce the Dirac mass\nterms. Together with the Majorana masses for the leptonic triplets, the light\nneutrinos obtain non-zero seesaw masses. We point out that it is also possible\nto have a quadruplet Higgs field to produce the Dirac mass terms to facilitate\nthe seesaw mechanism. The vacuum expectation value of the quadruplet Higgs is\nconstrained to be small by electroweak precision data. Therefore the Yukawa\ncouplings of a quadruplet can be much larger than those for a doublet. We also\nfind that unlike the usual Type III seesaw model where at least two copies of\nleptonic triplets are needed, with both doublet and quadruplet Higgs\nrepresentations, just one leptonic triplet is possible to have a\nphenomenologically acceptable model because light neutrino masses can receive\nsizable contributions at both tree and one loop levels.

Local concentration\nof OHe in the matter of detectors is rapidly adjusted to the incoming flux of\ncosmic OHe and possess annual modulation due to Earth's orbital motion around\nthe Sun. The potential of OHe-nucleus interaction is determined by polarization\nof OHe by the Coulomb and nuclear force of the approaching nucleus.

Evaluation within a model of\nperturbative fragmentation confirms the shortness of the production length.\nThis result is at variance with the unjustified assumption of long production\nlength, made within the popular energy loss scenario.

Adjusting a single parameter, the transport\ncoefficient, we describe quite well the data from LHC and RHIC for the\nsuppression factor R_{AA} as function of pT, collision energy and centrality.\nWe observe that the complementary effect of initial state interaction causes a\nflattening and even fall of R_{AA} at large pT. The azimuthal anisotropy of\nhadron production, calculated with no further adjustment, also agrees well with\ndata at different energies and centralities. \n\n"}

{"id": "1408.0857", "contents": "Title: Impact of the equation-of-state -- gravity degeneracy on constraining\n  the nuclear symmetry energy from astrophysical observables Abstract: There is a degeneracy between the equation of state (EOS) of superdense\nneutron-rich nuclear matter and the strong-field gravity in understanding\nproperties of neutron stars. While the EOS is still poorly known, there are\nalso longstanding ambiguities in choosing General Relativity or alternative\ngravity theories in the not-so-well tested strong-field regime. Besides\npossible appearance of hyperons and new phases, the most uncertain part of the\nnucleonic EOS is currently the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy.\nTo provide information that may help break the EOS-gravity degeneracy, we\ninvestigate effects of symmetry energy within its uncertain range determined by\nterrestrial nuclear laboratory experiments on the gravitational binding energy\nand spacetime curvature of neutron stars within GR and the scalar-tensor (ST)\ntheory of gravity. In particular, we focus on effects of the following\nparameters characterizing the EOS of neutron-rich nucleonic matter: (1) the\nincompressibility $K_0$ of symmetric nuclear matter, (2) the slope $L$ of\nsymmetry energy at saturation density and (3) the high-density behavior of\nsymmetry energy. We find that the variation of either the density slope $L$ or\nthe high-density behavior of symmetry energy leads to large changes in both the\nbinding energy and curvature of neutron stars while effects of varying the more\nconstrained $K_0$ are negligibly small. The difference in predictions using the\nGR and the ST theory appears only for massive neutron stars, and is\nsignificantly smaller than the differences resulting from variations in the\nsymmetry energy. We conclude that within the ST theory of gravity, the\nEOS-gravity degeneracy has been broken by the recent relativistic pulsar\nmeasurements, and that measurements of neutron star properties sensitive to the\ncompactness constrain mainly the density dependence of the symmetry energy. \n\n"}

Thus knowledge of \\lambda_pp\\mu\\ is required for a correct\ninterpretation of these experiments.\n  Purpose: Recently the MuCap experiment has measured the capture rate\n\\Lambda_S from the singlet p\\mu\\ atom, employing a low density active target to\nsuppress pp\\mu\\ formation (PRL 110, 12504 (2013)). Nevertheless, given the\nunprecedented precision of this experiment, the existing experimental knowledge\nin \\lambda_pp\\mu\\ had to be improved.\n  Method: The MuCap experiment derived the weak capture rate from the muon\ndisappearance rate in ultra-pure hydrogen. By doping the hydrogen with 20 ppm\nof argon, a competing process to pp\\mu\\ formation was introduced, which allowed\nthe extraction of \\lambda_pp\\mu\\ from the observed time distribution of decay\nelectrons.\n  Results: The pp\\mu\\ formation rate was measured as \\lambda_pp\\mu = (2.01 +-\n0.06(stat) +- 0.03(sys)) 10^6 s^-1. This result updates the \\lambda_pp\\mu\\\nvalue used in the above mentioned MuCap publication.\n  Conclusions: The 2.5x higher precision compared to earlier experiments and\nthe fact that the measurement was performed at nearly identical conditions to\nthe main data taking, reduces the uncertainty induced by \\lambda_pp\\mu\\ to a\nminor contribution to the overall uncertainty of \\Lambda_S and g_P, as\ndetermined in MuCap. Our final value for \\lambda_pp\\mu\\ shifts \\Lambda_S and\ng_P by less than one tenth of their respective uncertainties compared to our\nresults published earlier. \n\n"}

The study of the multiplicity centrality dependence reveals a\nnew scaling between the measured pseudorapidity spectra and the calculations.\nBy means of this scaling, called the energy balanced limiting fragmentation\nscaling, one reproduces the pseudorapidity spectra for all centralities. The\nscaling elucidates some differences in the multiplicity and midrapidity density\ncentrality dependence obtained at RHIC and LHC. These findings reveal an\ninherent similarity in the multiplicity energy dependence from the most central\ncollisions and centrality data. A new regime in heavy-ion collisions to occur\nat about a TeV energy is indicated, similar to that observed in the earlier\nstudies of the midrapidity densities. Predictions are made for the mean\nmultiplicities to be measured in proton-proton and heavy-ion collisions at the\nLHC. \n\n"}

Several decades of experimental measurements have shown that our\ncurrent understanding is incomplete if only the quark and gluon spin\ncontribution is considered. Over the last few years it has become increasingly\nclear that the contribution from the orbital angular momentum of the quarks and\ngluons has to be included as well. For instance, the sea quark orbital\ncontribution remains largely unexplored. Measurements accessing the sea quark\nSivers distribution will provide a probe of the sea quark orbital contribution.\nThe upcoming E1039 experiment at Fermilab will access this distribution via the\nDrell-Yan process using a 120 GeV unpolarized proton beam directed on a\npolarized proton target. At E1039 kinematics the $u$-$\\bar{u}$ annihilation\nprocess dominates the Drell-Yan cross section ($x_{Target}$ = 0.1 $\\sim$ 0.35).\nIf the $\\bar{u}$ quark carries zero net angular momentum, then the measured\nDrell-Yan single-spin asymmetry should be zero, and vice versa.

We discuss some of\nthe challenges for this technology, for which balancing the goal of achieving\nthe best sensitivity with that of cost effective scale-up requires optimization\nover a large parameter space. Critical for this are the precision measurements\nof the fundamental properties of both electron and nuclear recoil tracks down\nto the lowest detectable energies. Such measurements are necessary to provide a\nbenchmark for background discrimination and directional sensitivity that could\nbe used for future optimization studies for directional dark matter\nexperiments. In this paper we describe a small, high resolution, high signal-\nto-noise GEM-based TPC with a 2D CCD readout designed for this goal. The\nperformance of the detector was characterized using alpha particles, X-rays,\ngamma-rays, and neutrons, enabling detailed measurements of electron and\nnuclear recoil tracks. Stable effective gas gains of greater than $1 \\times\n10^5$ were obtained in 100 Torr of pure CF$_4$ by a cascade of three standard\nCERN GEMs each with a 140 $\\mu$m pitch.

Heavy quarks are considered\neffective probes of the properties of the QGP as they are created on a short\ntime scale, with respect to that of the QGP, and subsequently interact with it.\nMoreover, for a proper assessment of the characteristics of the matter produced\nin heavy-ion collisions, it is important to disentangle the final state effects\ndue to the formation of a QGP from the initial state effects due to the fact\nthat nuclei are present in the colliding system. Both initial and final state\neffects may lead to qualitatively similar phenomena in the observables of\ninterest. The measurement of charmed meson production in proton-nucleus\ncollisions allows to assess initial state effects present in nuclear\ncollisions, under the assumption that an extended deconfined medium is not\ncreated in this kind of interactions.

They are\nexpected to be useful to produce neutron-rich unstable nuclei. Nuclear dynamics\nleading to these processes depends sensitively on nuclear properties such as\ndeformation and shell structure. Purpose: We elucidate reaction mechanisms of\nMNT and QF processes involving heavy deformed nuclei, making detailed\ncomparisons between microscopic time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) calculations\nand measurements for the $^{64}$Ni+$^{238}$U reaction. Methods:\nThree-dimensional Skyrme-TDHF calculations are performed. Particle-number\nprojection method is used to evaluate MNT cross sections from the TDHF wave\nfunction after collision. Results: Fragment masses, total kinetic energy (TKE),\nscattering angle, contact time, and MNT cross sections are investigated for the\n$^{64}$Ni+$^{238}$U reaction.

Studying simultaneously the 124Xe(a,n)127Ba\nreaction channel at higher energy allowed to further identify the source of a\ndiscrepancy between data and prediction. The 124Xe + alpha cross sections were\nmeasured with the activation method using a thin window 124Xe gas cell. The\nstudied energy range was between E = 11 and 15 MeV close above the\nastrophysically relevant energy range. The obtained cross sections are compared\nwith statistical model calculations. The experimental cross sections are\nsmaller than standard predictions previously used in astrophysical\ncalculations. As dominating source of the difference, the theoretical alpha\nwidth was identified. The experimental data suggest an alpha width lower by at\nleast a factor of 0.125 in the astrophysical energy range. An upper limit for\nthe 128Ba(g,a)124Xe stellar rate was inferred from our measurement. The impact\nof this rate was studied in two different models for core-collapse supernova\nexplosions of 25 solar mass stars. A significant contribution to the 124Xe\nabundance via this reaction path would only be possible when the rate was\nincreased above the previous standard value. Since the experimental data rule\nthis out, they also demonstrate the closure of this production path. \n\n"}

These factorization breaking effects arise from soft color\nexchanges between charm-anticharm pairs undergoing hadronization and comoving\npartons that are long-lived on time scales of quarkonium formation. We compute\nthe short distance pair production of heavy quarks in the Color Glass\nCondensate (CGC) effective field theory and employ an improved Color\nEvaporation model (ICEM) to describe their hadronization into quarkonium at\nlarge distances. The combined CGC+ICEM model provides a quantitative\ndescription of $J/\\psi$ and $\\psi(2S)$ data in proton-proton (p+p) collisions\nfrom both RHIC and the LHC.

We thus consider a functional\nobtained from the density matrix expansion of local nuclear potentials from\nchiral effective field theory. We propose a parametrization of this functional\ncarefully calibrated and validated on selected ground-state properties that is\nsuitable for large-scale calculations of nuclear properties. The first\ncomponent of this functional is a non-local functional of the density and\ncorresponds to the direct part (Hartree term) of the expectation value of local\nchiral potentials on a Slater determinant. A second component is a local\nfunctional of the density and is obtained by applying the density matrix\nexpansion to the exchange part (Fock term) of the expectation value of the\nlocal chiral potential. We apply the UNEDF2 optimization protocol to determine\nthe coupling constants of this energy functional. We obtain a set of\nmicroscopically-constrained functionals for local chiral potentials from\nleading-order up to next-to-next-to-leading order with and without three-body\nforces and contributions from $\\Delta$ excitations.

A model defect is usually a\nfunction of energy and describes the difference between the model prediction\nand the truth. Of course, neither the truth nor the model defect are\naccessible. A Gaussian process (GP) enables to define a probability\ndistribution on possible shapes of a model defect by referring to intuitively\nunderstandable concepts such as smoothness and the expected magnitude of the\ndefect. Standard specifications of GPs impose a typical length-scale and\namplitude valid for the whole energy range, which is often not justified, e.g.,\nwhen the model covers both the resonance and statistical range.

It was shown that the reacceleration\nmodels designed to match secondary to primary nuclei ratios (e.g.,\nboron/carbon) produce too few antiprotons. Matching both the secondary to\nprimary nuclei ratio and the antiproton flux requires artificial breaks in the\ndiffusion coefficient and the primary injection spectrum suggesting the need\nfor other approaches.\n  In the present paper we discuss one possibility to overcome these\ndifficulties.

Water from the SNO detector is\npassed through a vacuum degasser (in the light water system) or a membrane\ncontact degasser (in the heavy water system) where dissolved gases, including\nradon, are liberated. The degasser is connected to a vacuum system which\ncollects the radon on a cold trap and removes most other gases, such as water\nvapor and nitrogen. After roughly 0.5 tonnes of H2O or 6 tonnes of D2O have\nbeen sampled, the accumulated radon is transferred to a Lucas cell. The cell is\nmounted on a photomultiplier tube which detects the alpha particles from the\ndecay of 222Rn and its daughters. The overall degassing and concentration\nefficiency is about 38% and the single-alpha counting efficiency is\napproximately 75%. The sensitivity of the radon assay system for D2O is\nequivalent to ~3 E(-15) g U/g water. The radon concentration in both the H2O\nand D2O is sufficiently low that the rate of background events from U-chain\nelements is a small fraction of the interaction rate of solar neutrinos by the\nneutral current reaction. \n\n"}

The reaction is characterized by a high\ndegree of transparency of the collisions partners leading to the formation of a\nbaryon-poor central region.

The initial energy density is well\nabove the one considered necessary for the formation of the Quark Gluon Plasma,\nQGP.
