In particular, there is a BRST operator Q (Q^2=0) which\ngenerates the differential in the Woronowicz theory and gives information about\n(co)homologies of quantum Lie algebras.

This result implies that the statistical anisotropy mainly\nappears on large scales, while the spectrum on small scales remains highly\nisotropic. Moreover, due to this $-1/k^2$ factor, the power on large scales is\nsuppressed. Thus, our model can simultaneously explain the observed anisotropic\nalignments of the low-$\\ell$ multipoles and their low power. \n\n"}

For instance quantum groups, that is Hopf algebras, have been\nfamiliar to theoretical physicists for a while now. Nowdays many examples of\nsymmetries of categorical flavor -- categorical groups, groupoids, Lie\nalgebroids and their higher analogues -- appear in physically motivated\nconstructions and faciliate constructions of geometrically sound models and\nquantization of field theories. Here we consider two flavours of categorified\nsymmetries: one coming from noncommutative algebraic geometry where varieties\nthemselves are replaced by suitable categories of sheaves; another in which the\ngauge groups are categorified to higher groupoids. Together with their gauge\ngroups, also the fiber bundles themselves become categorified, and their gluing\n(or descent data) is given by nonabelian cocycles, generalizing group\ncohomology, where infinity-groupoids appear in the role both of the domain and\nthe coefficient object.

{"id": "1004.3558", "contents": "Title: Exploring the String Axiverse with Precision Black Hole Physics Abstract: It has recently been suggested that the presence of a plenitude of light\naxions, an Axiverse, is evidence for the extra dimensions of string theory. We\ndiscuss the observational consequences of these axions on astrophysical black\nholes through the Penrose superradiance process. When an axion Compton\nwavelength is comparable to the size of a black hole, the axion binds to the\nblack hole \"nucleus\" forming a gravitational atom in the sky. The occupation\nnumber of superradiant atomic levels, fed by the energy and angular momentum of\nthe black hole, grows exponentially. The black hole spins down and an axion\nBose-Einstein condensate cloud forms around it. When the attractive axion\nself-interactions become stronger than the gravitational binding energy, the\naxion cloud collapses, a phenomenon known in condensed matter physics as\n\"Bosenova\". The existence of axions is first diagnosed by gaps in the mass vs\nspin plot of astrophysical black holes. For young black holes the allowed\nvalues of spin are quantized, giving rise to \"Regge trajectories\" inside the\ngap region. The axion cloud can also be observed directly either through\nprecision mapping of the near horizon geometry or through gravitational waves\ncoming from the Bosenova explosion, as well as axion transitions and\nannihilations in the gravitational atom. Our estimates suggest that these\nsignals are detectable in upcoming experiments, such as Advanced LIGO, AGIS,\nand LISA. Current black hole spin measurements imply an upper bound on the QCD\naxion decay constant of 2 x 10^17 GeV, while Advanced LIGO can detect signals\nfrom a QCD axion cloud with a decay constant as low as the GUT scale.

It is illustrated that in describing\nthe anomalous form factor, the holographic approach is asymptotically dual to\nthe perturbative QCD (pQCD) framework, with the pion mode \\pi(z)\\sim z\ncorresponding to the asymptotic pion distribution amplitude. This indicates\nsome inconsistency in light-front holography, since \\pi(z)\\sim z would be dual\nto \\varphi(x)\\sim \\sqrt{x(1-x)} there. After clarifying these subtleties, we\nemploy the relation between the holographic and the perturbative expressions to\nstudy possible asymptotic violation of the transition form factor.

It has been suggested that a virtual\npartner able to play the game with human subjects can be an effective tool to\naffect the underlying neural processes needed to establish the necessary\nconnections between the players, and also to provide new clinical interventions\nfor the rehabilitation of patients suffering from social disorders. Inspired by\nthe motor processes of the central nervous system (CNS) and the musculoskeletal\nsystem in the human body, in this paper we develop a novel interactive\ncognitive architecture based on nonlinear control theory to drive a virtual\nplayer (VP) to play the mirror game with a human player (HP) in different\nconfigurations. Specifically, we consider two cases: the former where the VP\nacts as leader and the latter where it acts as follower. The crucial problem is\nto design a feedback control architecture capable of imitating and following or\nleading a human player (HP) in a joint action task. Movement of the\nend-effector of the VP is modeled by means of a feedback controlled\nHaken-Kelso-Bunz (HKB) oscillator, which is coupled with the observed motion of\nthe HP measured in real time. To this aim, two types of control algorithms\n(adaptive control and optimal control) are used and implemented on the HKB\nmodel so that the VP can generate human-like motion while satisfying certain\nkinematic constraints. A proof of convergence of the control algorithms is\npresented in the paper together with an extensive numerical and experimental\nvalidation of their effectiveness. A comparison with other existing designs is\nalso discussed, showing the flexibility and the advantages of our control-based\napproach. \n\n"}

Here, we study coordination in human ensembles via a novel\ncomputer-based set-up that enables individuals to coordinate each other's\nmotion from a distance so as to minimize the influence of social interaction.\nThe proposed platform makes it possible to implement different visual\ninteraction patterns among the players, so that participants take into\nconsideration the motion of a designated subset of the others. This allows the\nevaluation of the exclusive effects on coordination of the structure of\ninterconnections among the players and their own dynamics.

Since no separation of variables is known (or expected) for\ngeodesic motion on these backgrounds, we examine the 2D effective potentials\nfor photon trajectories, to obtain a deeper understanding of this phenomenon.\nWe find that the emergence of stable light rings on the background spacetimes,\nallows the formation of \"pockets\" in one of the effective potentials, for open\nsets of impact parameters, leading to an effective trapping of some\ntrajectories, dubbed quasi-bound orbits.

I also prove, in contrast to the above result, that the\nteleportation simulations of pure-loss, thermal, pure-amplifier, amplifier, and\nadditive-noise channels converge both strongly and uniformly to the original\nchannels, in the limit of ideal squeezing and detection for the simulations.\nFor these channels, I give explicit uniform bounds on the accuracy of their\nteleportation simulations.

Gravitation is then\nconformally-related to the standard model via a conformal transformation,\nmerely a function of the number of fermionic particles dominating the energy\ndensity associated with the ground state of the physical system. Doing so\nresolves major puzzles afflicting the standard models of particle physics and\ncosmology, clearly indicating these to be artifacts stemming from universally\nemploying the system of units selected here and now. In addition to the three\nknown fundamental interactions mediated by gauge bosons, a scalar-tensor\ninteraction is also accommodated by the theory; its inertial and gravitational\nsectors are characterized by whether contributions to the Weyl tensor vanish or\nare finite, respectively. In this approach both inertia and gravity are viewed\nas collective phenomena, with characteristic gravitational Planck scale devoid\nof fundamental meaning; consequently, mass hierarchy and Higgs mass instability\nconcerns are avoided altogether. Only standard model particles gravitate; dark\nmatter and dark energy have an inertial origin, and since the Higgs field does\nnot interact with photons it is an ideal candidate for explaining the dark\nsector of cosmology.

The present paper\nproposes a new approach to the problem, namely quantization in terms of the\ngroup SO(1,2): The crucial point is that the phase space S^2 = {phi mod 2pi,\nI>0} has the global structure S^1 x R^+ (a simple cone) and cannot be quantized\nin the conventional manner. As the group SO(1,2) acts appropriately on that\nspace its unitary representations of the positive discrete series provide the\ncorrect quantum theoretical framework. The space S^2 has the conic structure of\nan orbifold R^2/Z_2. That structure is closely related to the center Z_2 of the\nsymplectic group Sp(2,R). The basic variables on S^2 are the functions h_0 = I,\nh_1 = I cosphi and h_2 = -I sinphi, the Poisson brackets of which obey the Lie\nalgebra so(1,2). In the quantum theory they are represented by self-adjoint\ngenerators K_0, K_1 and K_2 of a unitary representation. A crucial prediction\nis that the classical Pythagorean relation h_1^2+h_2^2 = h_0^2 may be violated\nin the quantum theory. For each representation one can define 3 different types\nof coherent states the complex phases of which can be \"measured\" by means of\nK_1 and K_2 alone without introducing any new phase operators!

The problem is that the angle is a multivalued or\ndiscontinuous variable on the corresponding phase space. The remedy is to\nreplace phi by the smooth periodic functions cos phi and sin phi. In the case\nof the canonical pair (phi,l),l: orbital angular momentum (OAM), the phase\nspace S_(phi,l) ={phi in R mod 2pi, l in R} has the global structure S^1 x R of\na cylinder on which the Poisson brackets of the 3 functions cos phi, sin phi\nand l obey the Lie algebra of the euclidean group E(2) in the plane. This\nproperty provides the basis for the quantization of the system in terms of\nirreducible unitary representations of the group E(2) or of its covering\ngroups. A crucial point is that - due to the fact that the subgroup SO(2) = S^1\nis multiply connected - these representations allow for fractional OAM l = n +\nc, c in [0,1).
