T*'s and E*'s merge together with the Tc\ncurve and 3.5kBTc curve at pu - 1.1 in the overdoped regime, respectively. They\nfinally go to zero at pu - 1.3. The UEPD follows an asymmetric half-dome-shaped\nTc curve in which Tc appears at pu - 0.4, reaches a maximum at pu - 1, and\nrapidly goes to zero at pu - 1.3. The asymmetric half-dome-shaped Tc curve is\nat odds with the well-known symmetric superconducting dome for La2-xSrxCuO4\n(SrD-La214), in which two characteristic temperatures and energies converge as\npu increases and merge together at pu - 1.6, where Tc goes to zero. The UEPD\nclearly shows that pseudogap phase precedes and coexists with high temperature\nsuperconductivity in the underdoped and overdoped regimes, respectively. It is\nalso clearly seen that the upper limit of high-Tc cuprate physics ends at a\nhole concentration that equals to 1.3 times the optimal doping concentration\nfor almost all high-Tc cuprate materials, and 1.6 times the optimal doping\nconcentration for the SrD-La214.

In particular, plutonium metal is most especially vexing. Over the last\nfive decades theories proposed the presence of either ordered or disordered\nlocal moments at low temperatures. However, experiments such as magnetic\nsusceptibility, electrical resistivity, nuclear magnetic resonance, specific\nheat, and elastic and inelastic neutron scattering show no evidence for ordered\nor disordered magnetic moments in any of the six phases of plutonium. Beyond\nplutonium, the magnetic structure of other actinides is an active area of\nresearch given that temperature, pressure, and chemistry can quickly alter the\nmagnetic structure of the 5f states. For instance, curium metal has an\nexceedingly large spin polarization that results in a total moment of about 8\nBohr magneton/atom, which influences the phase stability of the metal.

In fact\nPt-substitution is detrimental to higher Tc, which increases up to 38 K only by\ncharge doping of pure FeAs layers. We point out, that two different negatively\ncharged layers [(FeAs)10]n- and (Pt3+yAs8)m- compete for the electrons provided\nby the Ca2+ ions, which is unique in the field of iron-based superconductors.\nIn the parent compound Ca10(FeAs)10(Pt3As8), no excess charge dopes the\nFeAs-layer, and superconductivity has to be induced by Pt-substitution, albeit\nbelow 15 K.

For\nalkali-intercalated iron selenides, even the structure of the superconducting\nphase is a subject of debate, in part because the onset of superconductivity is\naffected much more delicately by stoichiometry and preparation than in cuprate\nor pnictide superconductors. If high-quality, pure, superconducting\nintercalated iron selenides are ever to be made, the intertwined physics and\nchemistry must be explained by systematic studies of how these materials form\nand by and identifying the many coexisting phases. To that end, we prepared\npure K_2Fe_4Se_5 powder and superconductors in the K_xFe_{2-y}Se_2 system, and\nexamined differences in their structures by high-resolution synchrotron and\nsingle-crystal x-ray diffraction. We found four distinct phases: semiconducting\nK_2Fe_4Se_5, a metallic superconducting phase K_xFe_2Se_2 with x ranging from\n0.38 to 0.58, an insulator KFe_{1.6}Se_2 with no vacancy ordering, and an\noxidized phase K_{0.51(5)}Fe_{0.70(2)}Se that forms the PbClF structure upon\nexposure to moisture.

To date, this transition has necessitated significant post-hoc\nadjustments to theory in order to be described properly. Here we report\nstandard state-of-the-art first principles quantum Monte Carlo (QMC)\ncalculations of the structural dependence of the properties of VO$_2$. Using\nthis technique, we simulate the interactions between electrons explicitly,\nwhich allows for the metal-insulator transition to naturally emerge,\nimportantly without ad-hoc adjustments. The QMC calculations show that the\nstructural transition directly causes the metal-insulator transition and a\nchange in the coupling of vanadium spins. This change in the spin coupling\nresults in a prediction of a momentum-independent magnetic excitation in the\ninsulating state. While two-body correlations are important to set the stage\nfor this transition, they do not change significantly when VO$_2$ becomes an\ninsulator.

By considering the first order\nself$-$energy corrections to the spin wave spectrum, magnon decay rate,\nbimagnon interactions within the ladder approximation Bethe-Salpeter scheme,\nand the effect of three-magnon contributions up to 1/S- order we find that the\nRIXS spectra is non-trivially affected. For a purely isotropic triangular\nlattice model, the peak splitting mechanism and the appearance of a multipeak\nRIXS structure is primarily dictated by the damping of magnon modes. At a\nscattering wavevector corresponding to the zone center \\Gamma point and at the\nroton point q=M, where the magnon decay rate is zero, a stable single peak\nforms. At the $\\Gamma$ point, the contribution is purely trimagnon at the 1/S\nlevel and occurs approximately at the trimagnon energy of 6JS. The roton peak\noccurs at a lower energy of 4JS. The K-edge single peak RIXS spectra at the\nroton momentum can be utilized as an experimental signature to detect the\npresence of roton excitations. A unique feature of the triangular lattice\nK-edge RIXS spectra is the nonvanishing RIXS intensity at both the zone center\n$\\Gamma$ point and the antiferromagnetic wavevector K point.

After the solution, we calculate the\ninteratomic exchange interactions, by using the theory of infinitesimal spin\nrotations, and evaluate $T_{\\rm C}$.

ZrTe5\nhas host a long-standing puzzle on its anomalous transport properties; its\nunderlying origin remains elusive. Lately, ZrTe5 has ignited renewed interest\nbecause it is predicted that single-layer ZrTe5 is a two-dimensional\ntopological insulator and there is possibly a topological phase transition in\nbulk ZrTe5.

It is\nrevealed that with the singlet order parameter induced from the superconducting\nproximity effect, in quantum wells, not only can the triplet pairings arise due\nto the spin-orbit coupling, but also the triplet order parameter can be induced\ndue to the repulsive effective electron-electron interaction, including the\nelectron-electron Coulomb and electron-phonon interactions.

The\nenergy-domain FRG ({\\epsilon}FRG) presented here accounts for Fermi-liquid\ncorrections to quasi-particle energies and particle-hole excitations.

It is\nbased on the algebraic diagrammatic construction scheme for the self-energy\nwhich is formulated for crystal orbitals (CO-ADC). In this approach, the poles\nof the Green's function are determined by solving a suitable Hermitian\neigenvalue problem. The method is not only applicable to the outer valence and\nconduction bands, it is also stable for inner valence bands where strong\nelectron correlations are effective. The key to the proposed scheme is to\nevaluate the self-energy in terms of Wannier orbitals before transforming it to\na crystal momentum representation. Exploiting the fact that electron\ncorrelations are mainly local, one can truncate the lattice summations by an\nappropriate configuration selection scheme. This yields a flat configuration\nspace; i.e., its size scales only linearly with the number of atoms per unit\ncell for large systems and, under certain conditions, the computational effort\nto determine band structures also scales linearly. As a first application of\nthe new formalism, a lithium fluoride crystal has been chosen. A minimal basis\nset description is studied, and a satisfactory agreement with previous\ntheoretical and experimental results for the fundamental band gap and the width\nof the F 2p valence band complex is obtained. \n\n"}

In a recent theoretical study dealing\nwith quantum dualities associated with the quantum melting of solids it was\nargued that these kinematic constraints play a central role in defining the\nquantum field theories of relevance to the description of quantum liquid\ncrystalline states of the nematic type.

As far as the structural\nproperties are concerned, the comparison between theory and experiments for\nLSMO strained on the most commonly used substrates, shows an overall good\nagreement: the slight overestimate (at most of 1-1.5 %) for the equilibrium\nout-of-plane lattice constants points to possible defects in real samples. The\ninclusion of a Hubbard-like contribution on the Mn d states, according to the\nso-called \"LSDA+U\" approach, is rather ineffective from the structural point of\nview, but much more important from the electronic and magnetic point of view.\nIn particular, full half-metallicity, which is missed within a bare\ndensity-functional approach, is recovered within LSDA+U, in agreement with\nexperiments.

We explore the consistency of the associated\nscaling relations, Tc ~ 1/lamda(0) ~ gap(0) ~ 1/gsi(0) ~ Hc2(0)^-0.5 and Tc(H)\n~ 1/Lamda(0,H) ~ gap(0,h) ~ (Hc2(0)-H)^ 1/2, valid for all dimensions D > 2,\nwith experimental data, in Al, C doped MgB2 and overdoped cuprates. \n\n"}

We propose that\nthe two bands relevant for the cuprates are comprised of Cu dx2-y2, dz2, planar\nO psigma, and apical O pz orbitals. Along the diagonal, kx=ky in the Brillouin\nzone, the two band Fermi surfaces may cross. We associate the optimal doping\nfor the highest Tc with this point because only in the vicinity of this\ntouching point are inter-band Cooper pairs energetically possible. Due to the\nlack of time reversal invariance of an inter-band Cooper pair with itself, the\nstandard interpretation of Josephson tunneling is altered such that the\ndetailed nature of the single particle tunneling matrix elements contributes to\nthe supercurrent. The dx2-y2 gap observations from Josephson tunneling are\nshown to arise from our model with pairing due to phonons. A Hubbard model is\nwritten down for the two bands at the Fermi energy with realistic parameters\nfor LaSrCuO.
