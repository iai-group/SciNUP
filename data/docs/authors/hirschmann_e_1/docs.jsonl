For very rapidly rotating black holes (spin\na=J/M>0.9524M) we have found a class of very strong field eccentric orbits\nwhose angular momentum L_z increases with the orbit's inclination with respect\nto the equatorial plane, while keeping latus rectum and eccentricity fixed.\nThis behavior is in contrast with Newtonian intuition, and is in fact opposite\nto the \"normal\" behavior of black hole orbits. Such behavior was noted\npreviously for circular orbits; since it only applies to orbits very close to\nthe black hole, they were named \"nearly horizon-skimming orbits\". Our analysis\ngeneralizes this result, mapping out the full generic (inclined and eccentric)\nfamily of nearly horizon-skimming orbits. The earlier work on circular orbits\nreported that, under gravitational radiation emission, nearly horizon-skimming\norbits tend to evolve to smaller orbit inclination, toward prograde equatorial\nconfiguration. Normal orbits, by contrast, always demonstrate slowly growing\norbit inclination (orbits evolve toward the retrograde equatorial\nconfiguration). Using up-to-date Teukolsky-fluxes, we have concluded that the\nearlier result was incorrect: all circular orbits, including nearly\nhorizon-skimming ones, exhibit growing orbit inclination. Using kludge fluxes\nbased on a Post-Newtonian expansion corrected with fits to circular and to\nequatorial Teukolsky-fluxes, we argue that the inclination grows also for\neccentric nearly horizon-skimming orbits. We also find that the inclination\nchange is, in any case, very small. As such, we conclude that these orbits are\nnot likely to have a clear and peculiar imprint on the gravitational waveforms\nexpected to be measured by the space-based detector LISA. \n\n"}

Differentiating the master equation yields a new\nexpression for the tilt d(ln Omega_gw(f))/d(ln f). The relationship between r\nand Omega_gw(f) depends sensitively on the uncertain physics of the early\nuniverse, and we show that this uncertainty may be encapsulated (in a\nmodel-independent way) by two quantities: w_hat(f) and nt_hat(f), where\nnt_hat(f) is a certain logarithmic average over nt(k) (the primordial tensor\nspectral index); and w_hat(f) is a certain logarithmic average over w_tilde(a)\n(the effective equation-of-state in the early universe, after horizon\nre-entry). Here the effective equation-of-state parameter w_tilde(a) is a\ncombination of the ordinary equation-of-state parameter w(a) and the bulk\nviscosity zeta(a).

Abstract: In singularity generating spacetimes both the out-going and in-going\nexpansions of null geodesic congruences $\\theta ^{+}$ and $\\theta ^{-}$ should\nbecome increasingly negative without bound, inside the horizon. This behavior\nleads to geodetic incompleteness which in turn predicts the existence of a\nsingularity. In this work we inquire on whether, in gravitational collapse,\nspacetime can sustain singularity-free trapped surfaces, in the sense that such\na spacetime remains geodetically complete. As a test case, we consider a well\nknown solution of the Einstien Field Equations which is Schwarzschild-like at\nlarge distances and consists of a fluid with a $p=-\\rho $ equation of state\nnear $r=0$. By following both the expansion parameters $\\theta ^{+}$ and\n$\\theta ^{-}$ across the horizon and into the black hole we find that both\n$\\theta ^{+}$ and $\\theta ^{+}\\theta ^{-}$ have turning points inside the\ntrapped region.

Our starting\npoint is the observation that the notion of classical time is external to\nquantum mechanics. Hence there must exist an equivalent reformulation of\nquantum mechanics which does not refer to an external classical time. Such a\nreformulation is a limiting case of a more general quantum theory which becomes\nnonlinear on the Planck mass/energy scale. The nonlinearity gives rise to a\nquantum-classical duality which maps a `strongly quantum, weakly gravitational'\ndynamics to a `weakly quantum, strongly gravitational' dynamics.

Simple arguments show that the location of the\nlength-scale r_c, marking the transition from positive to negative\ncorrelations, is the same for any class of objects as for the full matter\ndistribution, i.e. it is invariant under biasing.

Such an\nassumption is valid in the weak field, as verified by precision experiments and\nobservations, but it need not hold in the dynamical strong-field regime where\ntests are lacking. Fundamental bias can cause systematic errors in the\ndetection and parameter estimation of signals, which can lead to a\nmischaracterization of the universe through incorrect inferences about source\nevent rates and populations. We propose a remedy through the introduction of\nthe parameterized post-Einsteinian framework, which consists of the enhancement\nof waveform templates via the inclusion of post-Einsteinian parameters. These\nparameters would ostensibly be designed to interpolate between templates\nconstructed in general relativity and well-motivated alternative theories of\ngravity, and also include extrapolations that follow sound theoretical\nprinciples, such as consistency with conservation laws and symmetries. As an\nexample, we construct parameterized post-Einsteinian templates for the binary\ncoalescence of equal-mass, non-spinning compact objects in a quasi-circular\ninspiral. The parametrized post-Einsteinian framework should allow matched\nfiltered data to select a specific set of post-Einsteinian parameters without a\npriori assuming the validity of the former, thus either verifying general\nrelativity or pointing to possible dynamical strong-field deviations. \n\n"}

This has been demonstrated to give good agreement with microscopic entropy\ncounting.

We investigate whether this radio\nloud/quiet dichotomy can be due to differences in the spin of the central black\nholes that power the radio-emitting jets. Using general relativistic\nmagnetohydrodynamic simulations, we construct steady state axisymmetric\nnumerical models for a wide range of black hole spins (dimensionless spin\nparameter 0.1 <= a <= 0.9999 and a variety of jet geometries. We assume that\nthe total magnetic flux through the black hole horizon at radius r_H(a) is held\nconstant. If the black hole is surrounded by a thin accretion disk, we find\nthat the total black hole power output depends approximately quadratically on\nthe angular frequency of the hole, P \\propto \\Omega_H^2 \\propto (a/r_H)^2.

If we can consider the entanglement entropy as thermodynamic entropy, we\ncan see the entropic force acting on the two black holes from the $r$\ndependence of $S_C$. We develop the computational method based on that of\nBombelli et al to obtain the $r$ dependence of $S_C$ of scalar fields whose\nLagrangian is quadratic with respect to the scalar fields. First we study $S_C$\nin $d+1$ dimensional Minkowski spacetime. In this case the state of the\nmassless free scalar field is the Minkowski vacuum state and we replace two\nblack holes by two imaginary spheres, and we take the trace over the degrees of\nfreedom residing in the imaginary spheres. We obtain the leading term of $S_C$\nwith respect to $1/r$. The result is $S_C=S_A+S_B+\\tfrac{1}{r^{2d-2}}\nG(R_1,R_2)$, where $S_A$ and $S_B$ are the entanglement entropy on the inside\nregion of $A$ and $B$, and $G(R_1,R_2) \\leq 0$. We do not calculate\n$G(R_1,R_2)$ in detail, but we show how to calculate it. In the black hole case\nwe use the method used in the Minkowski spacetime case with some modifications.\nWe show that $S_C$ can be expected to be the same form as that in the Minkowski\nspacetime case. But in the black hole case, $S_A$ and $S_B$ depend on $r$, so\nwe do not fully obtain the $r$ dependence of $S_C$. Finally we assume that the\nentanglement entropy can be regarded as thermodynamic entropy, and consider the\nentropic force acting on two black holes. We argue how to separate the\nentanglement entropic force from other force and how to cancel $S_A$ and $S_B$\nwhose $r$ dependence are not obtained.

In this paper, we develop a ray-tracing\nalgorithm to calculate the apparent surface areas of moderately spinning\nneutron stars making use of the Hartle-Thorne metric. This analytic metric\nallows us to calculate various observables of the neutron star in a way that\ndepends only on its macroscopic properties and not on the details of its\nequation of state.

For\nneutron stars with radii ~10 km, the corrections to the Schwarzschild spacetime\ncause the apparent surface area to increase with spin frequency. In contrast,\nfor neutron stars with radii ~15 km, the oblateness of the star dominates the\nspacetime corrections and causes the apparent surface area to decrease with\nincreasing spin frequency.

Here, we consider the implications of inhomogeneity in\ndust models for the connectedness of spatial sections at early times. We\nconsider a non-global Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) model designed to match\nobservations, a more general, heuristic model motivated by the former, and two\nspecific, global LTB models.

The\nprecession frequencies $\\Omega_{\\rho}$ and $\\Omega_z$ can be expressed as\nexpansions on the orbital frequency $\\Omega$, in which the moments enter the\ncoefficients in a prescribed form. Thus, observations can be fitted to these\nexpressions in order to evaluate the moments. If the compact object is a\nneutron star, constrains can be imposed on the equation of state. The same\nanalysis can be used for black holes as a test for the validity of the no-hair\ntheorem.

The resonant parametric instability is a well-known\nform of three-wave interaction in which a primary wave of frequency $\\omega_a$\nexcites a pair of secondary waves of frequency $\\omega_b+\\omega_c \\simeq\n\\omega_a$. Here we consider a nonresonant form of three-wave interaction in\nwhich a low-frequency primary wave excites a high-frequency p-mode and a\nlow-frequency g-mode such that $\\omega_b+\\omega_c >>\\omega_a$. We show that a\np-mode can couple so strongly to a g-mode of similar radial wavelength that\nthis type of interaction is unstable even if the primary wave amplitude is\nsmall. As an application, we analyze the stability of the tide in coalescing\nneutron star binaries to p-g mode coupling. We find that the equilibrium tide\nand dynamical tide are both p-g unstable at gravitational wave frequencies\nf_{gw} > 20 Hz and drive p-g pairs to significant energies on very short\ntimescales (much less than the orbital decay time). Resonant parametric\ncoupling to the tide is, by contrast, either stable or drives modes at a much\nsmaller rate. We do not solve for the saturation of the instability and\ntherefore cannot say precisely how it influences neutron star binaries.\nHowever, we show that if even a single daughter mode saturates near its wave\nbreaking amplitude, the p-g instability of the equilibrium tide: (i) induces\nsignificant orbital phase errors ($\\Delta \\phi$ > 1 radian) that accumulate\nprimarily at low frequencies (f_{gw} < 50 Hz) and (ii) heats the neutron star\ncore to T~10^{10} K.

In this work, we illustrate the\nnature of our framework by providing two explicit examples of one-parameter\nfamilies with backreaction. The first, based on previous work of Berger, is a\nfamily of polarized vacuum Gowdy spacetimes on a torus, which satisfies all of\nthe assumptions of our framework. As the parameter approaches its limiting\nvalue, the metric uniformly approaches a smooth background metric, but\nspacetime derivatives of the deviation of the metric from the background metric\ndo not converge uniformly to zero.

It performs Bayesian inference on two\nhypotheses: the GR hypothesis $\\mathcal{H}_{\\rm GR}$, and $\\mathcal{H}_{\\rm\nmodGR}$, which states that one or more of the post-Newtonian coefficients in\nthe waveform are not as predicted by GR. By the use of multiple sub-hypotheses\nof $\\mathcal{H}_{\\rm modGR}$, in each of which a different number of\nparameterized deformations of the GR phase are allowed, an arbitrarily large\nnumber of 'testing parameters' can be used without having to worry about a\nmodel being insufficiently parsimonious if the true number of extra parameters\nis in fact small. TIGER is well-suited to the regime where most sources have\nlow signal-to-noise ratios, again through the use of these sub-hypotheses.\nInformation from multiple sources can trivially be combined, leading to a\nstronger test. We focus on binary neutron star coalescences, for which\nsufficiently accurate waveform models are available that can be generated fast\nenough on a computer to be fit for use in Bayesian inference. We show that the\npipeline is robust against a number of fundamental, astrophysical, and\ninstrumental effects, such as differences between waveform approximants, a\nlimited number of post-Newtonian phase contributions being known, the effects\nof neutron star spins and tidal deformability on the orbital motion, and\ninstrumental calibration errors. \n\n"}

Anisotropy is known to affect the\nbulk properties of nonrotating neutron stars in General Relativity. In this\npaper we study the effects of anisotropy on slowly rotating stars in General\nRelativity. We also consider one of the most popular extensions of Einstein's\ntheory, namely scalar-tensor theories allowing for spontaneous scalarization (a\nphase transition similar to spontaneous magnetization in ferromagnetic\nmaterials). Anisotropy affects the moment of inertia of neutron stars (a\nquantity that could potentially be measured in binary pulsar systems) in both\ntheories.

In the quantum field\ntheoretic approach the Schwinger's mechanism is generally used to give an\nexplanation of this tunneling process. It is the decay of quantum vacuum into\nparticle anti-particle pairs near the black hole surface. However, in a\nreference frame undergoing an uniform accelerated motion in an otherwise flat\nMinkowski space-time geometry, in the non-relativistic approximation, the\nparticle production near the event horizon of a black hole may be treated as a\nkind of Fowler-Nordheim field emission, which is the typical electron emission\nprocess from a metal surface under the action of an external electrostatic\nfield. This type of emission from metal surface is allowed even at extremely\nlow temperature. It has been noticed that in one-dimensional scenario, the\nSchr$\\ddot{\\rm{o}}$dinger equation satisfied by the created particle\n(anti-particle) near the event horizon, can be reduced to a differential form\nwhich is exactly identical with that obeyed by an electron immediately after\nthe emission from the metal surface under the action of a strong electrostatic\nfield.

For cases where the spin is aligned with the orbital angular\nmomentum, the additional centrifugal support in the remnant hypermassive\nneutron star can prevent the prompt collapse to a black hole, while for\nantialigned cases the decreased total angular momentum can facilitate the\ncollapse to a black hole.

By then calculating the full canonically normalised one-loop\neffective potential for the condensate mode about a de Sitter background, we\ndemonstrate that, contrary to claims in the literature, this process may both\noccur and function in a phenomenologically viable manner. In particular, we\nfind that outside of certain unfortunate gauge choices, the stability of the\ncondensate is intimately tied via gravitational degrees of freedom to the sign\nof the tree-level cosmological constant.

With this distinction, one can make sense of superpositions\nas interference between alternative paths in the relational configuration space\nof the entire Universe. But the full use of relationalism brings us to a\ntimeless picture of Nature, as it does in the canonical approach (which\nculminates in the Wheeler-DeWitt equation).

Abstract: The aberration and Doppler coupling effects of the Cosmic Microwave\nBackground (CMB) were recently measured by the Planck satellite. The most\nstraightforward interpretation leads to a direct detection of our peculiar\nvelocity $\\beta$, consistent with the measurement of the well-known dipole. In\nthis paper we discuss the assumptions behind such interpretation. We show that\nDoppler-like couplings appear from two effects: our peculiar velocity and a\nsecond order large-scale effect due to the dipolar part of the gravitational\npotential. We find that the two effects are exactly degenerate but only if we\nassume second-order initial conditions from single-field Inflation. Thus,\ndetecting a discrepancy in the value of $\\beta$ from the dipole and the Doppler\ncouplings implies the presence of a primordial non-Gaussianity. We also show\nthat aberration-like signals likewise arise from two independent effects: our\npeculiar velocity and lensing due to a first order large-scale dipolar\ngravitational potential, independently on Gaussianity of the initial\nconditions. In general such effects are not degenerate and so a discrepancy\nbetween the measured $\\beta$ from the dipole and aberration could be accounted\nfor by a dipolar gravitational potential. Only through a fine-tuning of the\nradial profile of the potential it is possible to have a complete degeneracy\nwith a boost effect. Finally we discuss that we also expect other signatures\ndue to integrated second order terms, which may be further used to disentangle\nthis scenario from a simple boost. \n\n"}

It is found that when the temperature of the fluid is so low that the\nthermal energy of a particle is much smaller than its rest energy, the location\nof marginally stable circular orbit is almost the same as that in the test\nparticle case.

A key point in this proof is to construct a covariantly\nconserved energy-momentum tensor, which is achieved on the basis of this\nequivalence relation.

These quantized fields\nmay be defined on spacetimes with given classical background fields, also\nsections of natural vector bundles, in addition to the Lorentzian metric. The\nmass and the coupling constants are in particular viewed as background fields.\nWick powers of the quantized vector field are axiomatically defined imposing in\nparticular local covariance, scaling properties and smooth dependence on smooth\nperturbation of the background fields. A general classification theorem is\nestablished for finite renormalization terms (or counterterms) arising when\ncomparing different solutions satisfying the defining axioms of Wick powers.\nThe result is specialized to the case of general tensor fields.

In General Relativity (GR), horizons\nhave several defining properties. First, there exists a static spherically\nsymmetric solution to vacuum Einstein equations which possesses a horizon\ndefined as a null-surface on which the time-like Killing vector becomes null.\nSecond, in GR, a co-dimension two sphere of minimal area is necessarily a\nhorizon. On a quantum level, the classical gravitational action is supplemented\nby the quantum effective action obtained by integrating out the quantum fields\npropagating on a classical background. In this note we consider the case when\nthe quantum fields are conformal and perform a certain non-perturbative\nanalysis of the semiclassical equations obtained by varying the complete\ngravitational action. We show that, for these equations, both of the above\naspects do not hold. More precisely, we prove that i) a static spherically\nsymmetric metric that would describe a horizon with a finite Hawking\ntemperature is, generically, {\\it not} a solution; ii) a minimal $2$-sphere is\n{\\it not} a horizon but a tiny throat of a wormhole. We find certain bounds on\nthe norm of the Killing vector at the throat and show that it is, while\nnon-zero, an exponentially small function of the Bekenstein-Hawking (BH)\nentropy of the classical black hole. We also find that the possible temperature\nof the semiclassical geometry is exponentially small for large black holes.\nThese findings suggest that a black hole in the classical theory can be viewed\nas a certain (singular) limit of the semiclassical wormhole geometry.

In particular, we produce\ntwo classes of EOSs with and without phase transitions, each containing one\nmillion EOSs.

A\nparameter which is common to and plays a key role in both the GW and the EM\nanalyses is the viewing angle of the binary's orbit. If a binary is viewed from\ndifferent angles, the amount of GW energy changes (implying that orientation\nand distance are correlated) and the EM signatures can vary, depending on the\nstructure of the emission. Information about the viewing angle of the binary\norbital plane is therefore crucial to the interpretation of both the GW and the\nEM data, and can potentially be extracted from either side.\n  In the first part of this study, we present a systematic analysis of how well\nthe viewing angle of binary neutron stars can be measured from the GW data.

This model, GLTofDE, surprisingly provides a framework to\nstudy not only temporal tensions in cosmology e.g. $H_0$ tension but also\nspatial anomalies of CMB e.g. the hemispherical power asymmetry and\nquadrupole-octopole alignment. In the mean field (or Landau) approximation of\nGLTofDE, there is a spontaneously symmetry breaking exactly like the Higgs\npotential. We modeled this transition, phenomenologically, and showed that\nGLTofDE can resolve both the $H_0$ tension and Lyman-$\\alpha$ anomaly in a\nnon-trivial way. According to $\\chi^2$-analysis the transition happens at\n$z_t=0.738\\pm0.028$ while $H_0=71.89\\pm0.93$ km/s/Mpc and\n$\\Omega^{like}_{k}=-0.225\\pm0.049$ which are consistent with the latest $H(z)$\nreconstructions. In addition, the GLTofDE proposes a framework to address the\nCMB anomalies when it is considered beyond the mean field approximation. In\nthis regime existence of a long wavelength mode is a typical consequence which\nis named the Goldstone mode in the case of continuous symmetries. This mode,\nwhich is an automatic byproduct in GLTofDE, makes cosmological constant,\ndirection dependent. This means one side of the sky should be colder than the\nother side in agreement with what has been already observed in CMB. In addition\nbetween initial stochastic pattern and the final state with one long wavelength\nmode, we can observe smaller patches or protrusions of the biggest remaining\npatch in the simulation. Our simulations show these protrusions are few in\nnumbers and will be evolved according to Alan-Cahn mechanism. These protrusions\ncan give an additional effect on CMB which is the existence of aligned\nquadrupole-octopole mode and its direction should be orthogonal to the dipole\ndirection. We conclude that GLTofDE is a fertile framework both theoretically\nand phenomenologically. \n\n"}

On the other hand,\ninflationary models are spectacularly successful in providing an explanation of\nthe deviations from homogeneity. We point out here that the fundamental\nmechanism responsible for providing deviations from homogeneity -- namely, the\nevolutionary behavior of quantum modes with wavelength larger than the Hubble\nradius -- will operate whether or not inflation itself occurs. However, if\ninflation did not occur, one must directly confront the issue of the initial\nstate of modes whose wavelength was larger than the Hubble radius at the time\nat which they were \"born\".

In the coordinate frame in which these observers\nare at rest, the horizon manifests itself as a (coordinate) singularity in the\nmetric tensor. Regularization of this singularity removes the inaccessible\nregion, and leads to the following consequences: (a) The non-trivial\ntopological structure for the effective manifold allows one to obtain the\nstandard results of quantum field theory in curved space-time. (b) In case of\ngravity, this principle requires that the effect of the unobserved degrees of\nfreedom should reduce to a boundary contribution $A_{\\rm boundary}$ to the\ngravitational action. When the boundary is a horizon, $A_{\\rm boundary}$\nreduces to a single, well-defined term proportional to the area of the horizon.\nUsing the form of this boundary term, it is possible to obtain the full\ngravitational action in the semiclassical limit.

The\ncorrespondence is too close to be ignored as a coincidence, especially since\nthis solution fits the conceptual and numerical ideas about the dark energy,\nand also answers why this energy is starting to dominate at the present era in\nthe evolution of the Universe. \n\n"}

In general, the longer the\narm length L, the larger the motion the gravitational-wave induces on the test\nmasses, until L becomes comparable to the gravitational wavelength. Recently,\nschemes have been invented, in which displacement noises can be evaded by\nemploying differences between the influence of test-mass motions and that of\ngravitational waves on light propagation.

The main result is that either they are locally symmetric or they\nhave a covariantly constant null vector field, in this case defining a\nsubfamily of Brinkmann's class in n dimensions. Related issues and applications\nare considered, and new open questions presented. \n\n"}
