Our\nbasic operating assumption is that the main bulk of the effect stems from the\n\"one-loop dressed\" quark loop contributing to the full gluon self-energy. This\nquark loop is then calculated, using as basic ingredients the full quark\npropagator and quark-gluon vertex; for the quark propagator we use the solution\nobtained from the quark gap equation, while for the vertex we employ suitable\nAns\\\"atze, which guarantee the transversality of the answer. The resulting\neffect is included as a correction to the quenched gluon propagator, obtained\nin recent lattice simulations.

However, at high energies and large rapidities the\nwave function of one of the projectiles is probed at very small Bjorken $x$,\nbeing characterized by a large number of gluons. In this kinematical regime, a\nnew state of matter - the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) - is expected to be\nformed. One the main characteristics of such system is the presence of a new\ndynamical momentum scale, the saturation scale $Q_s$, which can assume values\nvery larger than the QCD confinement scale $\\Lambda_{QCD}$ and give the scale\nof the running coupling constant. In this paper we assume that in particular\nkinematical region probed by LHC forward (LHCf) experiment the saturation scale\ncan be considered the hard momentum scale present in the process and calculate\nthe forward neutral pion production at very low-$p_T$ using a perturbative\napproach.

In particular, we argue for a covariant mass bound conjecture: in a\nspacetime free of horizon, the mass inside a surface $A$ cannot exceed $16 \\pi\nG^2 m^2< A $, while the reverse holds in a spacetime with horizons. This is\ngiven a precise definition using the formalism of light-sheets. We show that\n$\\hbar/c$ may be also given a geometrical interpretation, namely $4 \\pi\n\\hbar^2/m^2< A$.

As a consequence the radiation emitted close to the\napparent horizon no longer arrives at infinity with a diverging redshift.\nStandard calculations of the emission of Hawking radiation then indicate that\nno blackbody radiation is emitted to infinity by the black hole in these\ncircumstances, hence there will also then be no black hole evaporation process\ndue to emission of such radiation as long as the matter flux is significant.\nThe essential adiabatic condition (eikonal approximation) for black hole\nradiation gives a strong limit to the black holes that can emit Hawking\nradiation. We give the mass range for the black holes that can radiate,\naccording to their cosmological redshift, for the special case of the cosmic\nblackbody radiation (CBR) influx (which exists everywhere in the universe). At\na very late stage of black hole formation when the CBR influx decays away, the\nblack hole horizon becomes first a slowly evolving horizon and then an isolated\nhorizon; at that stage, black hole radiation will start.

DM consists of axion-like particles\nwith mass of order eV and strong self-interactions. The condensate has a\npolytropic equation of state P~rho^3 giving rise to a superfluid core within\ngalaxies. Instead of behaving as individual collisionless particles, the DM\nsuperfluid is more aptly described as collective excitations. Superfluid\nphonons, in particular, are assumed to be governed by a MOND-like effective\naction and mediate a MONDian acceleration between baryonic matter particles.\nOur framework naturally distinguishes between galaxies (where MOND is\nsuccessful) and galaxy clusters (where MOND is not): due to the higher velocity\ndispersion in clusters, and correspondingly higher temperature, the DM in\nclusters is either in a mixture of superfluid and normal phase, or fully in the\nnormal phase.

We find that the stop\nmass has been excluded up to 430 GeV for $m_{\\tilde{\\chi}^0_1} \\lesssim 250$\nGeV and to 540 GeV for $m_{\\tilde{\\chi}^0_1} \\simeq 100$ GeV by the Run-1 SUSY\nsearches for $2b+E^{miss}_T$ and $1\\ell+jets+E^{miss}_T$, respectively. In a\nsmall strip of parameter space with $m_{\\tilde{\\chi}^0_1} \\gtrsim 190$ GeV, the\nstop mass can still be as light as 210 GeV and compatible with the Higgs mass\nmeasurement and the monojet bound. The 14 TeV LHC with a luminosity of 20\nfb$^{-1}$ can further cover such a light stop window by monojet and\n$2b+E^{miss}_T$ searches and push the lower bound of the stop mass to 710 GeV.\nWe also explore the potential to use the Higgs golden ratio,\n$D_{\\gamma\\gamma}=\\sigma(pp \\to h \\to \\gamma\\gamma)/\\sigma(pp \\to h \\to ZZ^*\n\\to4\\ell^\\pm)$, as a complementary probe for the light and compressed stop. If\nthis golden ratio can be measured at percent level at the high luminosity LHC\n(HL-LHC) or future $e^+e^-$ colliders, the light stop can be excluded for most\nof the currently allowed parameter region. \n\n"}

They restricted their discussion to those\nrealizations of antilinear symmetry in which all the energy eigenvalues of the\nHamiltonian are real. Here we extend the discussion to the two other\nrealizations possible with antilinear symmetry, namely energies in complex\nconjugate pairs or Jordan-block Hamiltonians that are not diagonalizable at\nall. In particular, we show that under certain circumstances it is possible for\nthe Goldstone boson mode itself to be one of the zero-norm states that are\ncharacteristic of Jordan-block Hamiltonians. While we discuss the same model as\nAlexandre et al. our treatment is quite different, though their main conclusion\nthat one can have Goldstone bosons in the non-Hermitian case remains intact. In\ntheir paper Alexandre et al. presented a variational procedure for the action\nin which the surface term played an explicit role, to thus suggest that one has\nto use such a procedure in order to establish the Goldstone theorem in the\nnon-Hermitian case.

In the case of BH-AS mergers we find that,\nin general, the largest scalar clouds are produced by mergers of low\ncompactness ASs and spinning BHs. Although in most of the cases which we study\nthe majority of the mass is absorbed by the BH within a short time after the\nmerger, in favourable cases the remaining cloud surrounding the final BH\nremnant can be as large as 30% of the initial axion star mass, with a bosonic\ncloud mass of order ~ 0.1 M_BH and peak energy density comparable to that\nobtained in a superradiant build up. This provides a dynamical mechanism for\nthe formation of long lived scalar hair, which could lead to observable signals\nin cases where the axion interacts with baryonic matter around the BH, or where\nit forms the seed of a future superradiant build up in highly spinning cases.\nConsidering NS-AS collisions we find two possible final states (i) a BH\nsurrounded by a (small) scalar cloud, or (ii) a stable NS enveloped in an axion\ncloud of roughly the same mass as the initial AS. Whilst for low mass ASs the\nNS is only mildly perturbed by the collision, a larger mass AS gives rise to a\nmassive ejection of baryonic mass from the system, purely due to gravitational\neffects. Therefore, even in the absence of a direct axion coupling to baryonic\nmatter, NS-AS collisions could give rise to electromagnetic observables in\naddition to their gravitational wave signatures. \n\n"}

By contrast, for $p > p_c$ the\nsystem can sustain only area-law entanglement. At $p = p_c$ the steady state is\nscale-invariant and, in 1+1D, the entanglement grows logarithmically after a\nquench.\n  To obtain a simple heuristic picture for the entangling-disentangling\ntransition, we first construct a toy model that describes the zeroth R\\'{e}nyi\nentropy in discrete time.

We show that the unusual behaviors\nencountered in these systems, typically nonuniversal scaling, are hardly\ncompatible with the hypothesis of a second order phase transition. We then\nreview the various perturbative and early nonperturbative approaches used to\ninvestigate these systems. We argue that none of them provides a completely\nsatisfactory description of the three-dimensional critical behavior. We then\nrecall the principles of the nonperturbative approach - the effective average\naction method - that we have used to investigate the physics of frustrated\nmagnets. First, we recall the treatment of the unfrustrated - O(N) - case with\nthis method. This allows to introduce its technical aspects. Then, we show how\nthis method unables to clarify most of the problems encountered in the previous\ntheoretical descriptions of frustrated magnets. Firstly, we get an explanation\nof the long-standing mismatch between different perturbative approaches which\nconsists in a nonperturbative mechanism of annihilation of fixed points between\ntwo and three dimensions. Secondly, we get a coherent picture of the physics of\nfrustrated magnets in qualitative and (semi-) quantitative agreement with the\nnumerical and experimental results. The central feature that emerges from our\napproach is the existence of scaling behaviors without fixed or pseudo-fixed\npoint and that relies on a slowing-down of the renormalization group flow in a\nwhole region in the coupling constants space. This phenomenon allows to explain\nthe occurence of generic weak first order behaviors and to understand the\nabsence of universality in the critical behavior of frustrated magnets. \n\n"}

We analyze\nthe process of hadronization in such a picture for the case when the\nquark-hadron transition is of first order, and argue that the inside region of\nsuch a shell must correspond to a supercooled (to $T = 0$) deconfined vacuum.\nHadrons from that region escape out, leaving a bubble of pure deconfined vacuum\nwith large vacuum energy. This bubble undergoes relativistic collapse, with\nhighly Lorentz contracted bubble walls, and may concentrate the entire energy\ninto extremely small regions. Eventually different portions of bubble wall\ncollide, with the energy being released in the form of particle production.\nThermalization of this system can lead to very high temperatures. With a\nreasonably conservative set of parameters, at LHC, the temperature of the hot\nspot can reach as high as 3 GeV, and well above it with more optimistic\nparameters. Such a hot spot can leave signals like large $P_T$ partons,\ndileptons, and enhanced production of heavy quarks. We also briefly discuss a\nspeculative possibility where the electroweak symmetry may get restored in the\nhighly dense region resulting from the decay of the bubble wall via the\nphenomenon of non-thermal symmetry restoration (which is usually employed in\nmodels of pre-heating after inflation).

Abstract: It seems to me at this time that two recent developments may permit fast\nprogress on our way to understand the symmetry structure of toroidally\n(compactified and) reduced M-theory. The first indication of a (possibly) thin\nspot in the wall that prevents us from deriving a priori the U-duality\nsymmetries of these models is to be found in the analysis of the hyperbolic\nbilliards that control the chaotic time evolution of (quasi)homogeneous\nanisotropic String, Supergravity or Einstein cosmologies near a spacelike\nsingularity. What happens is that U-duality symmetry controls chaos via\nnegative constant curvature. On the other hand it was noticed in 1982 that\n(symmetrizable) ''hyperbolic'' Kac-Moody algebras have maximal rank ten,\nexactly like superstring models and that two of these four rank ten algebras\nmatched physical theories. My second reason for optimism actually predates also\nthe previous breakthrough, it was the discovery in 1998 of surprising\nsuperalgebras extending U-dualities to all (p+1)-forms (associated to\np-branes). They have a super-nonlinear sigma model structure similar to the\nsymmetric space structure associated to 0-forms and they obey a universal\nself-duality field equation. As the set of forms is doubled to implement\nelectric-magnetic duality, they obey a set of first order equations. More\nremains to be discovered but the beauty and subtlety of the structure cannot be\na random emergence from chaos.

Some interesting results regarding this point are (1) the calculation of\nNoether Charges which are off-shell conserved, (2) the association of the\ndouble connection structure of the Transgression Form with both orientations of\nthe basis manifold and (3) the Subspace Separation Method, which allows us to\ndivide the action in bulk and boundary terms, and to split them in terms which\nreflect the physics corresponding to a symmetry group choice.\n  To construct the gauge theory explicitly, it is necessary to buid a new\nmathematical tool, called S-Expansion procedure. Analyzing the M Algebra under\nthe light of this method, it is possible to construct an invariant tensor for\nit.

There, a new concept of\nspinor field (as a sum of non homogeneous even multivectors fields) is used.\nHowever, a carefully analysis (detailed below) shows that the original Hestenes\ndefinition cannot be correct since it conflicts with the meaning of the Fierz\nidentities. In this paper we start a program dedicated to the examination of\nthe mathematical and physical basis for a comprehensive definition of the\nobjects used by Hestenes. In order to do that we give a preliminary definition\nof algebraic spinor fields (ASF) and Dirac-Hestenes spinor fields (DHSF) on\nMinkowski spacetime as some equivalence classes of well defined pairs of\nmathematical objects, one of the members of the pair being an even\nnonhomegeneous differential form.\n  The necessity of our definitions are shown by a carefull analysis of possible\nformulations of Dirac theory and the meaning of the set of Fierz identities.\n  We believe that the present paper clarifies some misunderstandings\n  (past and recent) appearing on the literature of the subject.

To this aim we introduce the Clifford\nbundle of multivector fields (Cl(M,g)) and the left\n(Cl_{Spin_{1,3}^{e}}^{l}(M)) and right (Cl_{Spin_{1,3}^{e}}^{r}(M))\nspin-Clifford bundles on the spin manifold (M,g)\n  The relation between left ideal algebraic spinor fields (LIASF) and\nDirac-Hestenes spinor fields (both fields are sections of\nCl_{Spin_{1,3}^{e}}^{l}(M)) is clarified. We study in details the theory of the\ncovariant derivatives of Clifford and left and right spin-Clifford fields.\nMoreover, we find a consistent Dirac equation for a DHSF (denoted DECl^{l}) on\na Lorentzian spacetime.\n  We succeeded also in obtaining a representation of the DECl^{l} in the\nClifford bundle Cl(M,g). It is such equation that we call the DHE and it is\nsatisfied by even multivector fields (EMFS). Of course, such a EMFS is not a\nspinor field. We provide moreover a consistent theory for the covariant\nderivatives of Clifford and spinor fields of all kinds. We emphasize that the\nDECl^{l} and the DHE, although related, are equations of different mathematical\nnatures. We study also the local Lorentz invariance and the electromagnetic\ngauge invariance and show that only for the DHE such transformations are of the\nsame mathematical nature, thus suggesting a possible link between them. \n\n"}

Moreover, this theory should have an additional formal structure of\na family of differentials. Roughly speaking, the triply graded theory by itself\ncaptures the large N behavior of the sl(N) homology, and differentials capture\nnon-stable behavior for small N, including knot Floer homology. The\ndifferentials themselves should come from another variant of sl(N) homology,\nnamely the deformations of it studied by Gornik, building on work of Lee.\n  While we do not give a mathematical definition of the triply graded theory,\nthe rich formal structure we propose is powerful enough to make many\nnon-trivial predictions about the existing knot homologies that can then be\nchecked directly. We include many examples where we can exhibit a likely\ncandidate for the triply graded theory, and these demonstrate the internal\nconsistency of our axioms.
