While this possibility was pointed out a long time ago, the\ngreatly improved quality of current data potentially allow to reverse-engineer\nthe problem: given the regions of pulsar parameter space favored by PAMELA and\nby ATIC, are there known pulsars that explain the data with reasonable\nassumptions on the injected e+e- pairs? In the context of simple benchmark\nmodels for estimating the e+e- output, we consider all known pulsars, as listed\nin the most complete available catalogue. We find that it is unlikely that a\nsingle pulsar be responsible for both the PAMELA e+ fraction anomaly and for\nthe ATIC excess, although two single sources are in principle enough to explain\nboth experimental results. The PAMELA excess e+ likely come from a set of\nmature pulsars (age ~ 10^6 yr), with a distance of 0.8-1 kpc, or from a single,\nyounger and closer source like Geminga. The ATIC data require a larger (and\nless plausible) energy output, and favor an origin associated to powerful, more\ndistant (1-2 kpc) and younger (age ~ 10^5$ yr) pulsars.

We have\nproposed a GUP consistent with string theory, black hole physics and doubly\nspecial relativity theories and have showed that this modifies all quantum\nmechanical Hamiltonians. When applied to an elementary particle, it suggests\nthat the space that confines it must be quantized, and in fact that all\nmeasurable lengths are quantized in units of a fundamental length (which can be\nthe Planck length). On the one hand, this may signal the breakdown of the\nspacetime continuum picture near that scale, and on the other hand, it can\npredict an upper bound on the quantum gravity parameter in the GUP, from\ncurrent observations.

{"id": "1311.0869", "contents": "Title: Why does the effective field theory of inflation work? Abstract: The effective field theory (EFT) of inflation has become the preferred method\nfor computing cosmological correlation functions of the curvature fluctuation,\n$\\zeta$. It makes explicit use of the soft breaking of time diffeomorphisms by\nthe inflationary background to organize the operators expansion in the action\nof the Goldstone mode $\\pi$ associated with this breaking. Despite its\nascendancy, there is another method for calculating $\\zeta$ correlators,\ninvolving the direct calculation of the so-called Horndeski action order by\norder in powers of $\\zeta$ and its derivatives. The question we address in this\nwork is whether or not the $\\zeta$ correlators calculated in these seemingly\ndifferent ways are in fact the same. The answer is that the actions to cubic\norder in either set of variables do indeed give rise to the same $\\zeta$\nbispectra, but that to make this equivalence manifest requires a careful\nunderstanding of the non-linear transformations relating $\\pi$ to $\\zeta$ and\nhow boundary terms in the actions are affected by imposing this relation. As a\nby product of our study we find that the calculations in the $\\pi$ language can\nbe simplified considerably in a way that allows us to use only the linear part\nof the $\\pi-\\zeta$ relation simply by changing the coefficients of some of the\noperators in the EFT.

More precisely, we introduce a new way to symmetry reduce the\nLQG-configuration space directly on the quantum level, and then show that this\nalways leads to a (strictly) larger reduced space than quantizing the classical\nconfiguration space of invariant connections (traditional approach). We prove a\ngeneral classification theorem for such invariant connections, which we then\nuse to calculate the classical configuration space for the homogeneous and the\nspherically symmetric case.

A prominent example for such a\nscenario is the task of quantum state merging where two parties aim to merge\ntheir parts of a tripartite quantum state. In standard quantum state merging,\nentanglement is considered as an expensive resource, while local quantum\noperations can be performed at no additional cost. However, recent developments\nshow that some local operations could be more expensive than others: it is\nreasonable to distinguish between local incoherent operations and local\noperations which can create coherence. This idea leads us to the task of\nincoherent quantum state merging, where one of the parties has free access to\nlocal incoherent operations only. In this case the resources of the process are\nquantified by pairs of entanglement and coherence. Here, we develop tools for\nstudying this process, and apply them to several relevant scenarios. While\nquantum state merging can lead to a gain of entanglement, our results imply\nthat no merging procedure can gain entanglement and coherence at the same time.\nWe also provide a general lower bound on the entanglement-coherence sum, and\nshow that the bound is tight for all pure states.

The leading order force is proportional to\nexponential decay with respect to the distance between the two nearest kinks or\nantikinks. The second order force have a similar behavior with the larger decay\nfactor, namely $3\\over 2$. We make use of these properties to construct the\nkink lattice.

Both the irreducible\nrepresentations of the Clifford algebra are considered. On the ring edges the\nbag (infinite mass) boundary conditions are imposed for the field operator.\nThis leads to the Casimir type effect on the vacuum characteristics. The radial\ncurrent vanishes. The charge and the azimuthal current are decomposed into the\nboundary-free and boundary-induced contributions. Both these contributions are\nodd periodic functions of the magnetic flux with the period equal to the flux\nquantum. An important feature that distinguishes the VEVs of the charge and\ncurrent densities from the VEV of the energy density, is their finiteness on\nthe ring edges. The current density is equal to the charge density for the\nouter edge and has the opposite sign on the inner edge. The VEVs are peaked\nnear the inner edge and, as functions of the field mass, exhibit quite\ndifferent features for two inequivalent representations of the Clifford\nalgebra.

Quantum heat transport phenomena in this system are\ninvestigated using two definitions of the heat current, one in terms of the\nsystem energy, and the other in terms of the bath energy. When we consider\ncorrelations among system-bath interactions (CASBI) -- which have a purely\nquantum mechanical origin -- the definition in terms of the bath energy becomes\ndifferent. We found that CASBI are necessary to maintain the consistency of the\nheat current with thermodynamic laws in the case of strong system-bath\ncoupling. However, within the context of the quantum master equation approach,\nboth of these definitions are identical. Through a numerical investigation, we\ndemonstrate this point for a non-equilibrium spin-boson model and a three-level\nheat engine model using the reduced hierarchal equations of motion approach\nunder strongly coupled and non-Markovian conditions. We observe cyclic behavior\nof the heat currents and the work performed by the heat engine,and we find that\ntheir phases depend on the system-bath coupling strength.

In the case of a large system-bath coupling, the efficiency\nincreases further if the bath temperature is decreased, with fixed the ratio of\nthe bath temperatures, due to the discretized nature of energy eigenstates.\nThis is also considered to be a unique feature of quantum heat engines. \n\n"}

The latter can be formally interpreted\nin terms of a magnetic flux treading the compact dimensions. In the compact\nsubspace, the field operator obeys quasiperiodicity conditions with arbitrary\nphases. The VEV of the charge density is zero and the current density has\nnonzero components along the compact dimensions only. They are periodic\nfunctions of the magnetic flux with the period equal to the flux quantum and\ntend to zero on the AdS boundary. Near the horizon, the effect of the\nbackground gravitational field is small and the leading term in the\ncorresponding asymptotic expansion coincides with the VEV for a massless field\nin the locally Minkowski bulk.

In particular, we have a bulk\nequation for a self-interacting (pseudo)scalar with arbitrary mass. By\ncomputing the energy-momentum tensors of the associated Einstein equations, to\ninclude the backreaction, and setting them to zero, we solve the resulting\nequations with the bulk one and get solutions corresponding to marginal and\nmarginally relevant deformations of the boundary CFT_3, which break the\nconformal symmetry. These bulk (pseudo)scalars are SU(4) x U(1)-singlet and the\ncorresponding solutions break all supersymmetries and parity because of the\nassociated (anti)M-branes wrapping around specific and mixed internal and\nexternal directions.

In other\nwords, if the integrand of the momentum integral for these two-point functions\nbehaves like $p^{-2\\nu}$, where $p$ is the momentum, in the infrared, then it\ncan be made to behave like $p^{-2\\nu+2}$ by large gauge transformations.

The geometric assumptions as a rule\nconcern symmetry assumptions (the so called collineations). The latter\nintroduces the 1+3 decomposition of tensor fields in spacetime. The 1+3\ndecomposition results in two major results. The 1+3 decomposition of $u_{a;b}$\ndefines the kinematic variables of the model (expansion, rotation, shear and\n4-acceleration) and defines the kinematics of the gravitational model. The 1+3\ndecomposition of the energy momentum tensor representing all gravitating matter\nintroduces the dynamic variables of the model (energy density, the isotropic\npressure, the momentum transfer or heat flux vector and the traceless tensor of\nthe anisotropic pressure) as measured by the defined observers and define the\ndynamics of he model. The symmetries assumed by the model act as constraints on\nboth the kinematical and the dynamical variables of the model.

Using the plasma model\nto describe the optical response of the metal, we express the Casimir energy as\na sum of contributions associated with evanescent surface plasmon modes and\npropagative cavity modes. In contrast to naive expectations, the plasmonic\nmodes contribution is essential at all distances in order to ensure the correct\nresult for the Casimir energy. One of the two plasmonic modes gives rise to a\nrepulsive contribution, balancing out the attractive contributions from\npropagating cavity modes, while both contributions taken separately are much\nlarger than the actual value of the Casimir energy. This also suggests\npossibilities to tailor the sign of the Casimir force via surface plasmons. \n\n"}

Furthermore, we discuss the implications of\nour approach for free real scalar fields offering a direct proof of the\nuniqueness of the relativistically invariant positive-definite inner product on\nthe space of real Klein-Gordon fields.
