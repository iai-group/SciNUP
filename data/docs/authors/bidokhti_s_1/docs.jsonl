For a class of many-to-one interference channels, we identify a\nnoisy interference regime, i.e., a regime where random coding and treating\ninterference as noise achieves sum-capacity. Specializing our results to the\nGaussian MIMO many-to-one interference channel, which is a special case of the\nclass of channels considered, we obtain new capacity results. Firstly, we\nextend the noisy interference regime, previously studied for (many-to-one)\ninterference channels with average power constraints on the inputs, to a more\ngeneral class of inputs. This more general class includes the practical\nscenario of inputs being restricted to fixed finite-size constellations such as\nPSK or QAM. Secondly, we extend noisy interference results previously studied\nin SISO interference channels with full channel state information (CSI) at all\nnodes, to MIMO and parallel Gaussian many-to-one interference channels, and to\nfading Gaussian many-to-one interference channels without CSI at the\ntransmitters. While the many-to-one interference channel requires interference\nalignment, which in turn requires structured codes in general, we argue that in\nthe noisy interference regime, interference is implicitly aligned by random\ncoding irrespective of the input distribution. As a byproduct of our study, we\nidentify a second class of many-to-one interference channels (albeit\ndeterministic) where random coding is optimal (though interference is not\ntreated as noise). The optimality of random coding in this second class of\nchannels is due to an interference resolvability condition which precludes\ninterference alignment and hence obviates the need of structured codes. \n\n"}

The main\ncontribution is to present an information-theoretic formulation of the problem\nwhich allows us to characterize, with a guaranteed gap to optimality, the rates\nthat can be achieved by different data streams.\n  Our results are articulated as follows. First, we exactly characterize the\ncapacity region of a two-user system assuming a binary-expansion deterministic\nchannel model. Second, we extend this result to a two-user additive white\nGaussian noise channel, providing an approximate characterization within\n$\\sqrt{3}/2$ bit of the actual capacity.

We solve this problem for generic\nconnected network topologies with asymmetric random link failures with a novel\ndistributed, decentralized algorithm. We refer to this algorithm as AL-G\n(augmented Lagrangian gossiping,) and to its variants as AL-MG (augmented\nLagrangian multi neighbor gossiping) and AL-BG (augmented Lagrangian broadcast\ngossiping.) The AL-G algorithm is based on the augmented Lagrangian dual\nfunction. Dual variables are updated by the standard method of multipliers, at\na slow time scale. To update the primal variables, we propose a novel,\nGauss-Seidel type, randomized algorithm, at a fast time scale.

One principal problem is\ncaused by the relay's not knowing the channel state. For the discrete\nmemoryless (DM) model, we establish two lower bounds and an upper bound on\nchannel capacity. The first lower bound is obtained by a coding scheme in which\nthe source describes the state of the channel to the relay and destination,\nwhich then exploit the gained description for a better communication of the\nsource's information message. The coding scheme for the second lower bound\nremedies the relay's not knowing the states of the channel by first computing,\nat the source, the appropriate input that the relay would send had the relay\nknown the states of the channel, and then transmitting this appropriate input\nto the relay. The relay simply guesses the sent input and sends it in the next\nblock. The upper bound is non trivial and it accounts for not knowing the state\nat the relay and destination.

In several such scenarios, interference alignment\nwas used to characterize the degrees-of-freedom of the channel. However, these\ndegrees-of-freedom capacity approximations are often too weak to make accurate\npredictions about the behavior of channel capacity at finite signal-to-noise\nratios (SNRs). The aim of this paper is to significantly strengthen these\nresults by showing that interference alignment can be used to characterize\ncapacity to within a constant gap. We focus on real, time-invariant,\nfrequency-flat X-channels. The only known solutions achieving the\ndegrees-of-freedom of this channel are either based on real interference\nalignment or on layer-selection schemes. Neither of these solutions seems\nsufficient for a constant-gap capacity approximation.\n  In this paper, we propose a new communication scheme and show that it\nachieves the capacity of the Gaussian X-channel to within a constant gap. To\naid in this process, we develop a novel deterministic channel model. This\ndeterministic model depends on the 0.5log(SNR) most-significant bits of the\nchannel coefficients rather than only the single most-significant bit used in\nconventional deterministic models. The proposed deterministic model admits a\nwider range of achievable schemes that can be translated to the Gaussian\nchannel. For this deterministic model, we find an approximately optimal\ncommunication scheme.

We extend this approach to an Accumulate-Compute and Forward\nprotocol which employs two phases: Multiple Access (MA) phase consisting of two\nchannel uses with independent messages in each channel use, and Broadcast (BC)\nphase having one channel use. Assuming that the two users transmit points from\nthe same 4-PSK constellation, every such network coding map that satisfies the\nexclusive law can be represented by a Latin Square with side 16, and\nconversely, this relationship can be used to get the network coding maps\nsatisfying the exclusive law.

However, due to the users'\nmutual interference, this problem is in general non-convex and thus cannot be\nsolved directly by conventional convex optimization techniques. In this paper,\nby jointly utilizing the monotonic optimization and rate profile techniques, we\ndevelop a new framework to obtain the globally optimal power control and/or\nbeamforming solutions to the WSR maximization problems for the GICs with\nsingle-antenna transmitters and single-antenna receivers (SISO), single-antenna\ntransmitters and multi-antenna receivers (SIMO), or multi-antenna transmitters\nand single-antenna receivers (MISO).

Semi-quantitative group testing (SQGT) is a (possibly) non-binary\npooling scheme that may be viewed as a concatenation of an adder channel and an\ninteger-valued quantizer. In its full generality, SQGT may be viewed as a\nunifying framework for group testing, in the sense that most group testing\nmodels are special instances of SQGT. For the new testing scheme, we define the\nnotion of SQ-disjunct and SQ-separable codes, representing generalizations of\nclassical disjunct and separable codes.

In this paper we study the emerging paradigm of sampling and\nreconstructing spatial fields using sensors that move through space. We show\nthat mobile sensing offers some unique advantages over static sensing in\nsensing time-invariant bandlimited spatial fields. Since a moving sensor\nencounters such a spatial field along its path as a time-domain signal, a\ntime-domain anti-aliasing filter can be employed prior to sampling the signal\nreceived at the sensor. Such a filtering procedure, when used by a\nconfiguration of sensors moving at constant speeds along equispaced parallel\nlines, leads to a complete suppression of spatial aliasing in the direction of\nmotion of the sensors. We analytically quantify the advantage of using such a\nsampling scheme over a static sampling scheme by computing the reduction in\nsampling noise due to the filter.

Our lower bound matches the sparse\nJohnson-Lindenstrauss upper bound of [Kane-Nelson, SODA 2012] up to an\nO(log(1/eps)) factor.\n  Next, we show that any m x n matrix with the k-restricted isometry property\n(RIP) with constant distortion must have at least Omega(klog(n/k)) non-zeroes\nper column if the number of the rows is the optimal value m = O(klog (n/k)),\nand if k < n/polylog n.

The\ncooperating base stations transmit identical signals over paths with\nnon-identical path losses, and the receiving mobile performs diversity\ncombining.

One particular challenge for\ninference under linear models is understanding the conditions on the dictionary\nunder which reliable inference is possible. This challenge has attracted\nrenewed attention in recent years since many modern inference problems deal\nwith the \"underdetermined\" setting, in which the number of observations is much\nsmaller than the number of columns in the dictionary. This paper makes several\ncontributions for this setting when the set of observations is given by a\nlinear combination of a small number of groups of columns of the dictionary,\ntermed the \"block-sparse\" case. First, it specifies conditions on the\ndictionary under which most block subdictionaries are well conditioned. This\nresult is fundamentally different from prior work on block-sparse inference\nbecause (i) it provides conditions that can be explicitly computed in\npolynomial time, (ii) the given conditions translate into near-optimal scaling\nof the number of columns of the block subdictionaries as a function of the\nnumber of observations for a large class of dictionaries, and (iii) it suggests\nthat the spectral norm and the quadratic-mean block coherence of the dictionary\n(rather than the worst-case coherences) fundamentally limit the scaling of\ndimensions of the well-conditioned block subdictionaries. Second, this paper\ninvestigates the problems of block-sparse recovery and block-sparse regression\nin underdetermined settings.

Two\ntypes of sampling right constrains are discussed. The first one is a limited\nsampling right constraint, in which the observer can take at most $N$\nobservations from this random sequence. Under this setup, we show that the cost\nfunction can be written as a set of iterative functions, which can be solved by\nMarkov optimal stopping theory. The optimal stopping rule is shown to be a\nthreshold rule. An asymptotic upper bound of the average detection delay is\ndeveloped as the false alarm probability goes to zero.

In this paper,\nperformance of network-integrated D2D communication under channel uncertainties\nis investigated where D2D traffic is carried through relay nodes.

An\noptimization problem is formulated for allocating radio resources at the relays\nto maximize end-to-end rate as well as satisfy the quality-of-service (QoS)\nrequirements for cellular and D2D user equipments under total power constraint.\nEach of the uncertain parameters is modeled by a bounded distance between its\nestimated and bounded values.

This is motivated by apparently two contrasting results even\nfor a simple 3 node network, with a single half-duplex relay. When all channels\nare assumed to be i.i.d. fading, a static schedule where the relay listens half\nthe time and transmits half the time combined with quantize-map-forward (QMF)\nrelaying is known to achieve the full-duplex performance. However, when there\nis no direct link between source and destination, a dynamic-decode-forward\n(DDF) strategy is needed to achieve the optimal tradeoff. In this case, a\nstatic schedule is strictly suboptimal and the optimal tradeoff is\nsignificantly worse than the full-duplex performance. In this paper we study\nthe general case when the direct link is neither as strong as the other links\nnor fully non-existent, and identify regimes where dynamic schedules are\nnecessary and those where static schedules are enough. We identify 4\nqualitatively different regimes for the single relay channel where the tradeoff\nbetween diversity and multiplexing is significantly different.

The channel is causal if, for\nevery $i$, the channel adversarially decides whether to erase the $i$th bit of\nits input based on inputs $1,...,i$, before it observes bits $i+1$ to $n$. Such\na channel is $p$-bounded if it can erase at most a $p$ fraction of the input\nbits over the whole transmission duration. Causal channels provide a natural\nmodel for channels that obey basic physical restrictions but are otherwise\nunpredictable or highly variable. For a given erasure rate $p$, our goal is to\nunderstand the optimal rate (the capacity) at which a randomized (stochastic)\nencoder/decoder can transmit reliably across all causal $p$-bounded erasure\nchannels. In this paper, we introduce the causal erasure model and provide new\nupper bounds and lower bounds on the achievable rate. Our bounds separate the\nachievable rate in the causal erasures setting from the rates achievable in two\nrelated models: random erasure channels (strictly weaker) and fully adversarial\nerasure channels (strictly stronger).

Each user is associated with a\nuser-centric cluster of BSs; the central processor shares the user's data with\nthe BSs in the cluster, which then cooperatively serve the user through joint\nbeamforming. Under this setup, this paper investigates the user scheduling, BS\nclustering and beamforming design problem from a network utility maximization\nperspective. Differing from previous works, this paper explicitly considers the\nper-BS backhaul capacity constraints. We formulate the network utility\nmaximization problem for the downlink C-RAN under two different models\ndepending on whether the BS clustering for each user is dynamic or static over\ndifferent user scheduling time slots. In the former case, the user-centric BS\ncluster is dynamically optimized for each scheduled user along with the\nbeamforming vector in each time-frequency slot, while in the latter case the\nuser-centric BS cluster is fixed for each user and we jointly optimize the user\nscheduling and the beamforming vector to account for the backhaul constraints.\nIn both cases, the nonconvex per-BS backhaul constraints are approximated using\nthe reweighted l1-norm technique. This approximation allows us to reformulate\nthe per-BS backhaul constraints into weighted per-BS power constraints and\nsolve the weighted sum rate maximization problem through a generalized weighted\nminimum mean square error approach.

However Shannon's theory of information does not provide\nformulae to fully determine these quantities. Several recent studies have begun\naddressing this.

Here we present the first in-depth analysis of PIDs on\nGaussian systems, both static and dynamical. We show that, for a broad class of\nGaussian systems, previously proposed PID formulae imply that: (i) redundancy\nreduces to the minimum information provided by either source variable, and\nhence is independent of correlation between sources; (ii) synergy is the extra\ninformation contributed by the weaker source when the stronger source is known,\nand can either increase or decrease with correlation between sources.

For large $n$, the synthesized channels become either\nessentially noiseless or almost perfectly noisy, but in total carry as much\ninformation as the original $n$ channels. Capacity can therefore be achieved by\ntransmitting messages over the essentially noiseless synthesized channels.\nUnfortunately, the set of inputs corresponding to reliable synthesized channels\nis poorly understood, in particular how the set depends on the underlying\nphysical channel.

The last decade has\nwitnessed a surge of algorithms and theoretical results addressing this\nquestion. One of the most popular algorithms is the $\\ell_p$-regularized least\nsquares (LPLS) given by the following formulation: \\[ \\hat{x}(\\gamma,p )\\in\n\\arg\\min_x \\frac{1}{2}\\|y - Ax\\|_2^2+\\gamma\\|x\\|_p^p, \\] where $p \\in [0,1]$.\nDespite the non-convexity of these problems for $p<1$, they are still appealing\nbecause of the following folklores in compressed sensing: (i) $\\hat{x}(\\gamma,p\n)$ is closer to $x_o$ than $\\hat{x}(\\gamma,1)$. (ii) If we employ iterative\nmethods that aim to converge to a local minima of LPLS, then under good\ninitialization these algorithms converge to a solution that is closer to $x_o$\nthan $\\hat{x}(\\gamma,1)$. In spite of the existence of plenty of empirical\nresults that support these folklore theorems, the theoretical progress to\nestablish them has been very limited.\n  This paper aims to study the above folklore theorems and establish their\nscope of validity.

To address this issue, we propose a novel relay\nstrategy, termed compute-compress-and-forward (CCF). In CCF, source messages\nare encoded using nested lattice codes constructed on a chain of nested coding\nand shaping lattices. A key difference of CCF from CF is an extra compressing\nstage inserted in between the computing and forwarding stages of a relay, so as\nto reduce the forwarding information rate of the relay. The compressing stage\nat each relay consists of two operations: first to quantize the computed\nmessage combination on an appropriately chosen lattice (referred to as a\nquantization lattice), and then to take modulo on another lattice (referred to\nas a modulo lattice). We study the design of the quantization and modulo\nlattices and propose successive recovering algorithms to ensure the\nrecoverability of source messages at destination.

Nevertheless,\none major problem that poses the use of RTEs in practice is represented by the\nquestion of setting the regularization parameter $\\rho$.

A deep\nunderstanding of the statistics of RTEs is essential to come up with\nappropriate choices for the regularization parameter.

A natural application of antenna arrays is\nsimultaneous transmission to multiple users, which requires multi-user\nprecoding at the transmitter. Hardware constraints, however, make it difficult\nto apply conventional lower frequency MIMO precoding techniques at mmWave. This\npaper proposes and analyzes a low complexity hybrid analog/digital beamforming\nalgorithm for downlink multi-user mmWave systems.

The proposed algorithm configures hybrid precoders at\nthe transmitter and analog combiners at multiple receivers with a small\ntraining and feedback overhead. For this algorithm, we derive a lower bound on\nthe achievable rate for the case of single-path channels, show its asymptotic\noptimality at large numbers of antennas, and make useful insights for more\ngeneral cases.

We\nprovide a simple and insightful formula for the approximate capacity of this\nchannel with bounded guarantee on the approximation gap independent of system\nparameters. This approximate characterization of the capacity identifies two\nqualitatively different operating regimes for this channel: in the large\nbattery regime, when $\\bar{B}\\geq \\bar{E}$, the capacity is approximately equal\nto that of an AWGN channel with an average power constraint equal to the\naverage energy harvesting rate, i.e. it depends only on the mean of $E_t$ and\nis (almost) independent of the distribution of $E_t$ and the exact value of\n$\\bar{B}$. In particular, this suggests that a battery size\n$\\bar{B}\\approx\\bar{E}$ is approximately sufficient to extract the infinite\nbattery capacity of the system.

One promis- ing approach is to locate users\nwith radio frequency fingerprints. However, its wide adoption in real-world\nsystems is challenged by the time- and manpower-consuming site survey process,\nwhich builds a fingerprint database a priori for localization. To address this\nproblem, we visualize the 3-D RF fingerprint data as a function of locations\n(x-y) and indices of access points (fingerprint), as a tensor and use tensor\nalgebraic methods for an adaptive tubal-sampling of this fingerprint space. In\nparticular using a recently proposed tensor algebraic framework in [1] we\ncapture the complexity of the fingerprint space as a low-dimensional\ntensor-column space. In this formulation the proposed scheme exploits\nadaptivity to identify reference points which are highly informative for\nlearning this low-dimensional space. Further, under certain incoherency\nconditions we prove that the proposed scheme achieves bounded recovery error\nand near-optimal sampling complexity. In contrast to several existing work that\nrely on random sampling, this paper shows that adaptivity in sampling can lead\nto significant improvements in localization accuracy. The approach is validated\non both data generated by the ray-tracing indoor model which accounts for the\nfloor plan and the impact of walls and the real world data. Simulation results\nshow that, while maintaining the same localization accuracy of existing\napproaches, the amount of samples can be cut down by 71% for the high SNR case\nand 55% for the low SNR case. \n\n"}

The state sequence is known non-causally to both the\nencoder and the adversary. Taking an Arbitrarily Varying Channel (AVC)\napproach, we consider two setups, namely, the discrete memoryless\nGel'fand-Pinsker (GP) AVC and the additive white Gaussian Dirty Paper (DP) AVC.\nWe determine the randomized coding capacity of both the AVCs under a maximum\nprobability of error criterion. Similar to other randomized coding setups, we\nshow that the capacity is the same even under the average probability of error\ncriterion. Even with non-causal knowledge of the state, we prove that the\nstate-aware adversary cannot affect the rate any worse than when it employs a\nmemoryless strategy which depends only on the instantaneous state. Thus, the\nAVC capacity characterization is given in terms of the capacity of the worst\nmemoryless channels with state, induced by the adversary employing such\nmemoryless jamming strategies. For the DP-AVC, it is further shown that among\nmemoryless jamming strategies, none impact the communication more than a\nmemoryless Gaussian jamming strategy which completely disregards the knowledge\nof the state.

In next-generation heterogeneous networks where\nultra-dense small-cell base stations are deployed,\nsimultaneous-wireless-information-and-power-transfer (SWIPT) is feasible over\nshort ranges. One challenge for designing a WPC system is the severe near-far\nproblem where a user attempts to decode an information-transfer (IT) signal in\nthe presence of extremely strong SWIPT signals. Jointly quantizing the mixed\nsignals causes the IT signal to be completely corrupted by quantization noise\nand thus the SWIPT signals have to be suppressed in the analog domain. This\nmotivates the design of a framework in this paper for analog spatial\ncancellation in a multi-antenna WPC system. In the framework, an analog circuit\nconsisting of simple phase shifters and adders, is adapted to cancel the SWIPT\nsignals by multiplying it with a cancellation matrix having unit-modulus\nelements and full rank, where the full rank retains the spatial-multiplexing\ngain of the IT channel.

The asymptotic\nbehavior of the rate-privacy function is studied as the quantization resolution\ngrows without bound and it is observed that not all of the properties of the\nrate-privacy function carry over from the discrete to the continuous case. \n\n"}

One can deem the reduced number as an effective\ndimensionality of the set of sparse signals and accordingly, define an\neffective oversampling rate as the ratio between the actual sampling rate and\nthe effective dimensionality. A natural conjecture is that the error of Sigma\nDelta quantization, previously shown to decay with the vanilla oversampling\nrate, should now decay with the effective oversampling rate when carried out in\nthe regime of compressed sensing. Confirming this intuition is one of the main\ngoals in this direction.\n  The study of quantization in CS has so far been limited to proving error\nconvergence results for Gaussian and sub-Gaussian sensing matrices, as the\nnumber of bits and/or the number of samples grow to infinity. In this paper, we\nprovide a first result for the more realistic Fourier sensing matrices. The\nmajor idea is to randomly permute the Fourier samples before feeding them into\nthe quantizer.

In this paper, we\npropose a drastically different two-step Fourier compressive sampling framework\nin continuous domain that can be implemented as a measurement domain\ninterpolation, after which a signal reconstruction can be done using classical\nanalytic reconstruction methods. The main idea is originated from the\nfundamental duality between the sparsity in the primary space and the\nlow-rankness of a structured matrix in the spectral domain, which shows that a\nlow-rank interpolator in the spectral domain can enjoy all the benefit of\nsparse recovery with performance guarantees.

Minimum\nstorage regenerating (MSR) codes are an important class of optimal regenerating\ncodes that minimize (first) the amount of data stored per node and (then) the\nrepair bandwidth. Specifically, an $[n,k,d]$-$(\\alpha)$ MSR code $\\mathbb{C}$\nover $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is defined as follows. Using such a code $\\mathbb{C}$, a\nfile $\\cal{F}$ consisting of $\\alpha k$ symbols over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ can be\ndistributed among $n$ nodes, each storing $\\alpha$ symbols, in such a way that:\nThe file $\\cal{F}$ can be recovered by downloading the content of any $k$ of\nthe $n$ nodes; and the content of any failed node can be reconstructed by\naccessing any $d$ of the remaining $n-1$ nodes and downloading $\\alpha/(d-k+1)$\nsymbols from each of these nodes. Unfortunately, explicit constructions of\n$[n,k,d]$ MSR codes are known only for certain special cases: either low rate,\nnamely $k/n<0.5$, or high repair connectivity, namely $d = n-1$. Although\nsetting $d = n-1$ minimizes the repair bandwidth, it may be impractical to\nconnect to all the remaining nodes in order to repair a single failed node.

This game enables to capture the\ndynamics of both the queues and channel states of the system. To solve this\ngame, assuming a large homogeneous UDN deployment, the problem is cast as a\nmean-field game (MFG) in which the MFG equilibrium is analyzed with the aid of\nlow-complexity tractable partial differential equations.

Most of the definitions\nof long memory of a stationary process $X=\\{X_1, X_2,\\cdots,\\}$ are based on\nthe second-order properties of the process. The excess entropy of a stationary\nprocess is the summation of redundancies which relates to the rate of\nconvergence of the conditional entropy $H(X_n|X_{n-1},\\cdots, X_1)$ to the\nentropy rate. It is proved that the excess entropy is identical to the mutual\ninformation between the past and the future when the entropy $H(X_1)$ is\nfinite. We suggest the definition that a stationary process is long memory if\nthe excess entropy is infinite. Since the definition of excess entropy of a\nstationary process requires very weak moment condition on the distribution of\nthe process, it can be applied to processes whose distributions without bounded\nsecond moment. A significant property of excess entropy is that it is invariant\nunder invertible transformation, which enables us to know the excess entropy of\na stationary process from the excess entropy of other process.

Under this setting we derive\nthe secondary user's achievable rates and the related constraints to guarantee\nthe primary user's weak secrecy rate, when Gelfand-Pinsker coding is used at\nthe secondary transmitter. In addition, we propose a multi-phase transmission\nscheme to include 1) the phases of the clean relaying with cooperative jamming\nand 2) the latency to successfully decode the primary message at the secondary\ntransmitter. A capacity upper bound for the secondary user is also derived.\nNumerical results show that: 1) the proposed scheme can outperform the\ntraditional ones by properly selecting the secondary user's parameters of\ndifferent transmission schemes according to the relative positions of the\nnodes; 2) the derived capacity upper bound is close to the secondary user's\nachievable rate within 0.3 bits/channel use, especially when the secondary\ntransmitter/receiver is far/close enough to the primary receiver/transmitter,\nrespectively.

Specifically, a\nMIMO MAC with one base station (BS) equipped with several distributed antenna\nsets is considered.

The analysis is based on\noperator-valued free probability theory, which broadens the range of\napplicability of free probability techniques tremendously. By replacing\nindependent Gaussian random matrices with operator-valued random variables\nsatisfying certain operator-valued freeness relations, the free deterministic\nequivalent of the considered channel Gram matrix is obtained.

Furthermore, we study the effects of\nspatial interdependence among BSs on network performance with a retransmission\nscheme via considering heterogeneous cellular networks in which small-cell BSs\nexhibit a clustered topology in practice.

However, MIMO radar poses new challenges for both hardware design\nand digital processing. In particular, achieving high azimuth resolution\nrequires a large number of transmit and receive antennas. In addition, the\ndigital processing is performed on samples of the received signal, from each\ntransmitter to each receiver, at its Nyquist rate, which can be prohibitively\nlarge when high resolution is needed. Overcoming the rate bottleneck,\nsub-Nyquist sampling methods have been proposed that break the link between\nradar signal bandwidth and sampling rate. In this work, we extend these methods\nto MIMO configurations and propose a sub-Nyquist MIMO radar (SUMMeR) system\nthat performs both time and spatial compression.

More specifically, suppose\nthat we have encoded $k$ data symbols using an $(n,k)$ code with code length\n$n$ and dimension $k.$ During storage, some of the codeword coordinates might\nbe corrupted by errors. We aim to recover the original data by reading the\ncorrupted codeword with a limit on the transmitting bandwidth, namely, we can\nonly download an $\\alpha$ proportion of the corrupted codeword.

A\nnaive scheme is to read $\\alpha n$ coordinates of the codeword. This method\nused in conjunction with MDS codes guarantees recovery from any $\\lfloor(\\alpha\nn-k)/2\\rfloor$ errors.

Unfortunately, this\ntask is often stymied by the extremely large dimension of the variables. We\nmight hope to replace each variable by a lower-dimensional representation that\npreserves the relationship with the other variable. The theoretically ideal\nimplementation is the use of minimal sufficient statistics, where it is\nwell-known that either X or Y can be replaced by their minimal sufficient\nstatistic about the other while preserving the mutual information. While\nintuitively reasonable, it is not obvious or straightforward that both\nvariables can be replaced simultaneously. We demonstrate that this is in fact\npossible: the information X's minimal sufficient statistic preserves about Y is\nexactly the information that Y's minimal sufficient statistic preserves about\nX. As an important corollary, we consider the case where one variable is a\nstochastic process' past and the other its future and the present is viewed as\na memoryful channel. In this case, the mutual information is the channel\ntransmission rate between the channel's effective states. That is, the\npast-future mutual information (the excess entropy) is the amount of\ninformation about the future that can be predicted using the past.

The first result, from which the paper\ntitle is derived, deals with the so called \"greedy-merge\" algorithm.

In particular, to\nenable reliable uplink communications for IoT devices with a minimum total\ntransmit power, a novel framework is proposed for jointly optimizing the\nthree-dimensional (3D) placement and mobility of the UAVs, device-UAV\nassociation, and uplink power control. First, given the locations of active IoT\ndevices at each time instant, the optimal UAVs' locations and associations are\ndetermined. Next, to dynamically serve the IoT devices in a time-varying\nnetwork, the optimal mobility patterns of the UAVs are analyzed. To this end,\nbased on the activation process of the IoT devices, the time instances at which\nthe UAVs must update their locations are derived. Moreover, the optimal 3D\ntrajectory of each UAV is obtained in a way that the total energy used for the\nmobility of the UAVs is minimized while serving the IoT devices.

Analytical results show that, using coded caching and wireless\nmulticasting, without channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT),\nlinear scaling of the content delivery rate with respect to $K$ can be achieved\nin some different ways.

In this paper, we\nconsider storage capacity as a natural information-theoretic analogue of the\nminimum vertex cover of a graph. Indeed, while it was known that storage\ncapacity is upper bounded by minimum vertex cover, we show that by treating it\nas such we can get a 3/2 approximation for planar graphs, and a 4/3\napproximation for triangle-free planar graphs. Since the storage capacity is\nintimately related to the index coding rate, we get a 2 approximation of index\ncoding rate for planar graphs and 3/2 approximation for triangle-free planar\ngraphs. We also show a polynomial time approximation scheme for the index\ncoding rate when the alphabet size is constant.

To cope with this problem, directional beamforming both\nat the Base Station (BS) side and at the user side is necessary in order to\nestablish a strong path conveying enough signal power. Finding such beamforming\ndirections is referred to as the Beam Alignment (BA) and is known to be a\nchallenging problem.

As a result, our proposed\nalgorithm is highly robust to variations of the channel time-dynamics compared\nwith other proposed approaches based on the estimation of the channel\ncoefficients, rather than of their second-order statistics. In the proposed\nscheme, the BS probes the channel in the Downlink (DL) letting each user to\nestimate its own path direction. All the users within the BS coverage are\ntrained simultaneously, without requiring \"beam refinement\" with multiple\ninteractive rounds of Downlink/Uplink (DL/UL) transmissions, as done in other\nschemes.

Realizing this in practice, though, requires\novercoming several challenges. First, the use of narrow beams and the\nsensitivity of mmWave signals to blockage greatly impact the coverage and\nreliability of highly-mobile links. Second, highly-mobile users in dense mmWave\ndeployments need to frequently hand-off between base stations (BSs), which is\nassociated with critical control and latency overhead. Further, identifying the\noptimal beamforming vectors in large antenna array mmWave systems requires\nconsiderable training overhead, which significantly affects the efficiency of\nthese mobile systems. In this paper, a novel integrated machine learning and\ncoordinated beamforming solution is developed to overcome these challenges and\nenable highly-mobile mmWave applications. In the proposed solution, a number of\ndistributed yet coordinating BSs simultaneously serve a mobile user. This user\nideally needs to transmit only one uplink training pilot sequence that will be\njointly received at the coordinating BSs using omni or quasi-omni beam\npatterns.

This approach radically differs from the conventional\nCommunication paradigm, which assumes transmitters are of two types: either\nthey have a common goal, or they act as opponent, e.g. jammer, eavesdropper. We\nformulate a point-to-point source-channel coding problem with state\ninformation, in which the encoder and the decoder choose their respective\nencoding and decoding strategies in order to maximize their long-run utility\nfunctions.

Each client already\nhas some messages as side information and requests a particular unknown message\nfrom the server. All clients learn the coding matrix so that they can decode\nand retrieve their requested data. Our starting observation is that, learning\nthe coding matrix can pose privacy concerns: it may enable a client to infer\ninformation about the requests and side information of other clients. In this\npaper, we mitigate this privacy concern by allowing each client to have limited\naccess to the coding matrix. In particular, we design coding matrices so that\neach client needs only to learn some of (and not all) the rows to decode her\nrequested message. By means of two different privacy metrics, we first show\nthat this approach indeed increases the level of privacy.

Distance-based ranking is analytically tractable and can lead to\nimportant insights. However, it may not be appropriate in a multipath fading\nenvironment where a near user suffers from severe fading while a far user\nexperiences weak fading. Since the ranking of users in a NOMA system has a\ndirect impact on coverage probability analysis, impact of the traditional\ndistance-based ranking, as opposed to instantaneous signal power-based ranking,\nneeds to be understood. This will enable us to identify scenarios where\ndistance-based ranking, which is easier to implement compared to instantaneous\nsignal power-based ranking, is acceptable for system performance analysis.

A natural\nextension is to the local recovery of a set of $t$ erased symbols. There have\nbeen several approaches proposed for the handling of multiple erasures.

{"id": "quant-ph/0702005", "contents": "Title: A decoupling approach to the quantum capacity Abstract: We give a short proof that the coherent information is an achievable rate for\nthe transmission of quantum information through a noisy quantum channel. Our\nmethod is to produce random codes by performing a unitarily covariant\nprojective measurement on a typical subspace of a tensor power state. We show\nthat, provided the rank of each measurement operator is sufficiently small, the\ntransmitted data will with high probability be decoupled from the channel's\nenvironment. We also show that our construction leads to random codes whose\naverage input is close to a product state and outline a modification yielding\nunitarily invariant ensembles of maximally entangled codes. \n\n"}
